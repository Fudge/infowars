[00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:09.402]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.062 --> 00:00:10.863]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.643 --> 00:00:12.584]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.184 --> 00:00:16.807]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.387 --> 00:00:21.450]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:39.321]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:40.382]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:40.462 --> 00:00:42.362]  It's the 10th day of December 2010.
[00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:47.284]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.304 --> 00:00:53.306]  And we have a jam-packed radio broadcast slash TV transmission for you today.
[00:00:53.386 --> 00:01:00.268]  We have Dr. Rand Paul, Senator-elect, popping in the last 20 minutes of the broadcast today.
[00:01:00.968 --> 00:01:03.248]  Sometime after 1.30, in between patients.
[00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:04.429]  What a hard-working guy.
[00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:05.229]  That's
[00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:28.883]  Forced relocation of populations into areas where they don't have as big a carbon footprint.
[00:01:28.943 --> 00:01:32.945]  So, a big excuse for a giant power grab on that front.
[00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:33.705]  He'll be joining us.
[00:01:34.145 --> 00:01:39.147]  Of course, Bob Chapman joins us on the economy for 30 minutes, coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:39.247 --> 00:01:48.910]  And Michael Braverman will be joining us in 30 minutes, one of the producers of Jesse Ventura's television show that has been covertly being censored in the background.
[00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.714]  particularly the police state episode.
[00:01:51.754 --> 00:01:57.886]  So Rand Paul, James Dillingpole, Bob Chapman and Michael Breverman all on this live Friday broadcast.
[00:01:58.247 --> 00:01:58.487]  Okay.
[00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:01.343]  All of this news in front of me.
[00:02:01.743 --> 00:02:03.785]  I've got so many incredible stacks.
[00:02:03.805 --> 00:02:11.312]  We're gonna get into Ron Paul, author of In the Fed, to lead panel overseeing the central bank.
[00:02:12.053 --> 00:02:13.354]  That's out of Bloomberg.
[00:02:13.394 --> 00:02:16.137]  Speaking of Bloomberg, he's gonna run for president.
[00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:18.099]  I mean, that much is clear.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.083]  And Bloomberg's non-campaign for president
[00:02:23.494 --> 00:02:26.316]  is basically behaving just like someone who's getting ready to run for president.
[00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.457]  So is Rick Perry, the governor of Texas.
[00:02:30.197 --> 00:02:32.759]  And Bloomberg is not a, quote, independent.
[00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:38.982]  Bloomberg is more extreme than even other members of the Democratic Party.
[00:02:40.516 --> 00:02:44.278]  He should be a member of the Communist Party the way he behaves.
[00:02:45.438 --> 00:02:49.300]  And Michael Bloomberg is just totally anti-Second Amendment.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:57.504]  He wants to try to tax you or arrest restauranteurs if they put too much salt in your food.
[00:02:57.864 --> 00:03:02.026]  He is the antithesis of the type of person we need as a president.
[00:03:02.984 --> 00:03:03.224]  I think?
[00:03:17.842 --> 00:03:24.368]  And of course, Rick Perry's horrible as well, another establishment type, but at least he isn't for banning your guns.
[00:03:24.828 --> 00:03:25.989]  So, that is coming up.
[00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.914]  Also, I've got mixed feelings about this, and I meant to talk about it yesterday.
[00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:33.857]  I'm going to try to get into it some today, but we are jam-packed with guests.
[00:03:34.873 --> 00:03:39.934]  Incentives for Machete denied, the Austin American-Statesman reports.
[00:03:40.695 --> 00:04:00.600]  The film is basically like a Ford Foundation, liberation theology, racial division film that shows Texas lawmakers in cowboy hats shooting pregnant Hispanics in the stomach and basically every white person is a screaming racist who needs to die with a Mexican uprising race war.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:14.463]  And I just pointed out that if the Texas Film Commission denied funding on tax breaks to a film about Waco, because they thought it showed Texas in a bad light, that they have to deny funding to this.
[00:04:14.503 --> 00:04:16.044]  Now, I said don't deny the funding.
[00:04:16.504 --> 00:04:24.026]  They need to change the Texas law where, sure, have tax incentives for film, but government shouldn't be involved in what the messages are.
[00:04:24.646 --> 00:04:28.507]  After all, we're not East Germany, or at least we weren't in the past.
[00:04:29.647 --> 00:04:30.628]  And now they've denied them.
[00:04:30.668 --> 00:04:32.449]  It's going to be at least 1.7 million.
[00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.451]  And it just puts a bad taste in my mouth.
[00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:37.732]  But justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:42.015]  It was you, the listeners, in this radio show that caused the film commission to do this.
[00:04:42.455 --> 00:04:43.516]  There's no doubt about that.
[00:04:43.536 --> 00:04:47.258]  It's an outrageous Hispanic version of Birth of a Nation.
[00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:53.782]  And it's despicable, but nevertheless, boy, I bet Robert Rodriguez doesn't like me too much.
[00:04:54.143 --> 00:04:55.683]  We'll be right back with all the rest of the news.
[00:04:55.703 --> 00:04:56.184]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.441 --> 00:05:04.382]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:05:04.622 --> 00:05:10.663]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:05:11.023 --> 00:05:18.124]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:05:18.424 --> 00:05:23.005]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:05:28.246 --> 00:05:31.768]  If founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:05:31.988 --> 00:05:34.249]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:34.610]  Call us!
[00:05:47.737 --> 00:05:47.938]  At 1-800-340-7091.

[00:05:54.305 --> 00:05:54.746]  Thank you!
[00:06:00.043 --> 00:06:04.286]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.606 --> 00:06:05.207]  Number 1.
[00:06:05.527 --> 00:06:08.669]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:09.490]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.354]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.694 --> 00:06:15.134]  It's true.
[00:06:15.434 --> 00:06:19.998]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.318 --> 00:06:20.858]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.421]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.721 --> 00:06:28.424]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.624 --> 00:06:29.184]  Number four.
[00:06:29.424 --> 00:06:31.785]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:35.566]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.846 --> 00:06:36.386]  Number five.
[00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:40.567]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.787 --> 00:06:45.549]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:49.870]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.571]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:56.412]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:07:01.134 --> 00:07:04.775]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:07:05.155 --> 00:07:08.156]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:07:08.416 --> 00:07:13.198]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:07:13.218 --> 00:07:19.440]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.821]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:22.641]  Tim Geithner?
[00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:23.101]  Bernanke?
[00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:23.941]  They're arsonists!
[00:07:23.981 --> 00:07:25.122]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:07:25.142 --> 00:07:27.382]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:07:41.266 --> 00:07:45.191]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:07:45.652 --> 00:07:48.175]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:07:48.555 --> 00:07:57.666]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:08:01.963 --> 00:08:07.993]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.614 --> 00:08:11.579]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.754 --> 00:08:25.056]  I should add, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.TV today, that we do have the CBC out of Canada here.
[00:08:25.456 --> 00:08:26.196]  And so that's fine.
[00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:29.257]  Guys in the control room, you can go with that shot if you want to.
[00:08:29.317 --> 00:08:29.857]  It's kind of cool.
[00:08:29.877 --> 00:08:32.618]  You can see the guy from the backside with his camera.
[00:08:33.078 --> 00:08:36.899]  Just don't turn around, camera guys, if you don't want to be on internet television.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.000]  Well, they've got a big crew here.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:44.462]  It's almost like old-fashioned television back when the networks still had funds.
[00:08:46.162 --> 00:08:49.524]  Uh, so very interesting to have the CBC here.
[00:08:49.544 --> 00:08:55.488]  They have a show called The Fifth of State that I have found is the fairest.
[00:08:58.226 --> 00:09:05.327]  Maybe a program that I've seen of anything around the world when it comes to really looking at 9-11.
[00:09:06.107 --> 00:09:11.808]  When it comes to researching the different views that are out there.
[00:09:11.888 --> 00:09:15.849]  So this isn't for the Fifth Estate, it's for another show.
[00:09:16.609 --> 00:09:23.731]  But I look forward to seeing what they produce coming up when this airs sometime next year.
[00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:25.131]  Okay, folks.
[00:09:26.527 --> 00:09:29.870]  We've got Rand Paul popping in towards the end of the broadcast today, Senator-elect.
[00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:42.261]  We've got James Dillingpole on what's unfolding down in Mexico with the new attempt to openly set up a world dictatorship through the phony Green Movement.
[00:09:44.123 --> 00:09:50.489]  We also are going to be talking to Bob Chapman of International Forecaster and Michael Braverman.
[00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:52.650]  And I tell you, when it rains, it pours.
[00:09:56.363 --> 00:09:58.684]  Let me turn my phone ringer off here.
[00:09:59.485 --> 00:10:02.486]  It's a crazy, crazy show here today.
[00:10:04.427 --> 00:10:06.488]  Let me just run down some of what we're going to be covering.
[00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:11.811]  Pentagon Papers whistleblower calls for a new 911 investigation.
[00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:12.632]  Daniel Ellsberg.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:20.005]  Oh, going back three years ago, was on this show and basically said he questioned the official story of 9-11.
[00:10:20.765 --> 00:10:27.111]  And then we went with that headline and he contacted us back that day and said, well, that's what I said, but that's not exactly what I meant.
[00:10:27.572 --> 00:10:28.793]  I'm getting a lot of heat for this.
[00:10:29.473 --> 00:10:32.376]  And we said, OK, whatever, we'll change the headline.
[00:10:33.697 --> 00:10:37.080]  And but I mean, he said what he said.
[00:10:37.421 --> 00:10:40.263]  Well, now he's back in the news today.
[00:10:41.364 --> 00:10:46.085]  And the main players in releasing the Pentagon Papers were Daniel Ellsberg and Senator Mike Gravel.
[00:10:46.865 --> 00:10:53.207]  Ellsberg, of course, the former military analyst and famed whistleblower from the RAND Corporation who smuggled the Pentagon Papers out.
[00:10:53.587 --> 00:10:56.888]  Senator Gravel, the person who read the papers in the congressional record.
[00:10:57.308 --> 00:11:01.369]  This act made the papers public record so that they could not be censored by the government.
[00:11:01.749 --> 00:11:06.170]  Ellsberg and Gravel are receiving a lot of media attention right now for their support of WikiLeaks.
[00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.251]  In fact, let's get Senator Gravel on.
[00:11:08.871 --> 00:11:11.414]  For some reason we can't ever get Ellsberg back on.
[00:11:12.215 --> 00:11:13.856]  Try to get me Gravel next week, guys.
[00:11:13.876 --> 00:11:14.537]  I want to get him on.
[00:11:15.518 --> 00:11:19.843]  But little attention has been paid to Ellsberg and Gravel's support for a new 9-11 investigation.
[00:11:20.343 --> 00:11:22.145]  Well, I mean, I know Gravel's been on before.
[00:11:22.165 --> 00:11:23.126]  I know he's been promoting it.
[00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:29.112]  Ellsberg says that the case of a certain 9-11 whistleblower is far more explosive than the Pentagon Papers.
[00:11:29.693 --> 00:11:43.603]  And of course, that is Sybil Edmonds, who was an FBI translator listening to NSA communiques, and she told the 9-11 Commission what was really going on in closed session, and she was gagged.
[00:11:43.623 --> 00:11:49.888]  They said, you know, honey, come here and tell us what you know, and she went and told them, and then they said, okay, you're under national security, don't tell anybody.
[00:11:50.508 --> 00:11:55.192]  Well, she broke, about a year ago, that gag order.
[00:11:56.318 --> 00:12:12.475]  And said to the world, I listen to transmissions, this is Sybil Edmonds, with the CIA commanding Al-Qaeda and other criminal groups in narcotics trafficking, weapons trafficking, child kidnapping, I mean just every form of evil you can imagine.
[00:12:13.015 --> 00:12:14.997]  Oh, and what's in the Houston press?
[00:12:15.778 --> 00:12:17.519]  What's in other news today?
[00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:18.499]  WikiLeaks.
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.741]  Texas company helped pimp little boys in Afghanistan.
[00:12:22.761 --> 00:12:25.103]  I mean, this is always coming out about DynCorp.
[00:12:25.123 --> 00:12:26.523]  It's been in congressional hearings.
[00:12:27.264 --> 00:12:29.004]  And, oh, now they have it on Fox.
[00:12:29.225 --> 00:12:36.728]  Oh, we have to help the Taliban grow the opium that's breaking records in its production and shipping it in to the U.S.
[00:12:36.768 --> 00:12:38.169]  or al-Qaeda will get the money.
[00:12:38.729 --> 00:12:40.289]  See, now they hide it all in plain view.
[00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:46.051]  In spy talk in the Washington Post, the CIA comes out a few months ago and says, yeah, we made a fake Bin Laden video.
[00:12:47.291 --> 00:12:49.672]  They come out and they admit, yeah, we lied about WMDs.
[00:12:50.072 --> 00:12:52.053]  They come out and go, yeah, we're helping them grow the opium.
[00:12:52.393 --> 00:12:57.074]  Yeah, you know, it's in federal court that Blackwater, now XE,
[00:12:59.372 --> 00:13:05.117]  It's coming out in these sworn depositions about the naked parties, the drugs, the shooting people for fun on the highways.
[00:13:05.137 --> 00:13:10.020]  We've already got video of other contractors and troops killing people for fun.
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.722]  We have all of this information.
[00:13:13.963 --> 00:13:15.964]  And just more and more of it comes out.
[00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:25.411]  It turns out the Iraqis were telling the truth about the contractors and others just running around shooting up buildings and cars and people in broad daylight for fun.
[00:13:27.068 --> 00:13:43.397]  In fact, we first learned about it because many of these contractors and groups would put Elvis music to it and post it on YouTube of them just sitting off the side of the highway just shooting up minivans and cars in downtown Baghdad for their own enjoyment.
[00:13:46.138 --> 00:13:57.641]  When you don't have any oversight, when you have the CIA operating in secret since 1947, when you have the trillions of dollars that have been spent on black budget programs, you're going to have corruption.
[00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:00.321]  And it's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[00:14:00.421 --> 00:14:11.984]  And more and more crazy people who are sadistic and control freaks and who enjoy hurting people, bloodthirsty individuals, are going to get into positions of power.
[00:14:13.024 --> 00:14:29.938]  And so what we know is there has been basically a competition in Western governments in the last 60 years or so to see who can be more corrupt, who can be more deceptive, who can lie the best, who can make the biggest payoffs, who can steal the most money.
[00:14:30.814 --> 00:14:38.877]  And the population, not just of the United States or Europe or Canada, but the entire population of the world is beginning to wake up to this fact.
[00:14:39.277 --> 00:14:45.539]  What did Zbigniew Brzezinski say just a few months ago addressing the Council on Foreign Relations Canada branch?
[00:14:46.874 --> 00:14:51.055]  He said, for the first time in history, humanity is awake and staring.
[00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:52.636]  Staring at the elite.
[00:14:53.036 --> 00:14:56.477]  Staring at the global power blocs, the Anglo-American establishment.
[00:14:56.777 --> 00:15:01.139]  And that there's going to be intensified resistance to globalism.
[00:15:02.239 --> 00:15:07.441]  And the once arrogant Council on Foreign Relations look like they've seen a ghost.
[00:15:08.766 --> 00:15:11.369]  Looked like they'd opened their front door and seen a monster at it.
[00:15:11.789 --> 00:15:12.710]  You know, Frankenstein.
[00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.511]  They're scared.
[00:15:13.992 --> 00:15:18.356]  And that makes the ruling class very, very dangerous right now.
[00:15:18.957 --> 00:15:21.860]  People know they've been lied to over and over again.
[00:15:22.341 --> 00:15:26.926]  People know that special interests are controlling the major governments of the planet.
[00:15:27.486 --> 00:15:32.471]  Individuals have lost confidence in the system and for a good reason.
[00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:35.333]  And how is the establishment responding worldwide?
[00:15:35.693 --> 00:15:41.799]  With police state, with surveillance, with secret police, with provocateurs, with intimidation.
[00:15:44.716 --> 00:15:51.718]  CNN and others have reported that tourism is down in the last five years in the United States by upwards of 34 percent.
[00:15:52.458 --> 00:16:03.620]  That nine billion dollars a year, conservatively, is being lost because foreigners, whether it's from Africa or Asia or Latin America or Europe, don't want to come here.
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.301]  They know a Orwellian police state when they
[00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:08.281]  See it.
[00:16:08.582 --> 00:16:17.588]  They know when TSA is groping them and sticking their hands down their pants and putting them in the naked body scanners that this isn't freedom.
[00:16:17.868 --> 00:16:28.236]  They know when major retail stores across the United States put literal telescreens in at the checkout counters saying, watch other shoppers, report to Homeland Security.
[00:16:29.356 --> 00:16:35.561]  They know that that's creepy, absurdist, almost cartoon-level corruption.
[00:16:35.881 --> 00:16:36.562]  I mean, it...
[00:16:39.887 --> 00:16:45.514]  It's hard to believe even as it happens because it's so wild.
[00:16:46.015 --> 00:16:47.157]  It's so bizarre.
[00:16:47.197 --> 00:16:56.369]  It's like a Kurt Vonnegut book that he wrote back in the 1950s about an absurdist police state future.
[00:16:56.469 --> 00:16:57.831]  It's that crazy.
[00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.553]  Of course we know Kurt Vonnegut was a 9-11 truther.
[00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:21.214]  Kurt sent me a signed lithograph he did of the open birdcage and I had a chance to talk to him and his assistant as well but he thought that he was too old to do any more interviews and he'd already sworn six months before at a final speech at a university that that would be his last.
[00:17:21.775 --> 00:17:24.596]  And then he died a few months after I was contacted by him.
[00:17:24.616 --> 00:17:25.377]  That was too bad.
[00:17:25.757 --> 00:17:37.862]  But, of course, Kurt Vonnegut did know 9-11 was an inside job, and Daniel Ellsberg saying investigated, and six of the ten commissioners are saying the Pentagon criminally lied and covered up what really happened.
[00:17:39.002 --> 00:17:47.826]  So, that tiny, scared minority that crouches down and licks the hand of tyranny, that tells the majority of us that are
[00:17:49.642 --> 00:17:51.903]  Not even smart, but not brain-dead.
[00:17:52.303 --> 00:17:57.465]  Not brain-dead to the point that we recognize absurd tyranny when we see it.
[00:17:58.565 --> 00:18:07.088]  And now that they've gone from the enhanced pat-downs to the super-rape pat-downs, where they stick their hands under your blouse or in your pants and actually grab your genitals.
[00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:08.108]  This happened to Ron Paul.
[00:18:08.128 --> 00:18:12.490]  It's happened to Jesse Ventura, where they grab from the outside.
[00:18:13.911 --> 00:18:21.355]  Now, the head Indian ambassador from India is saying that she will never come to the United States again.
[00:18:21.375 --> 00:18:24.837]  That's a quote.
[00:18:24.897 --> 00:18:30.920]  Has vowed to never return to America after being confined to a glass cage and groped.
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.961]  And if you complain, they'll leave you in the glass cage for hours.
[00:18:34.241 --> 00:18:36.723]  And when you miss your flight, they laugh at you.
[00:18:37.768 --> 00:18:41.950]  Minimum wage, brown shirts, on a goonish power trip.
[00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.731]  And this isn't just confined to the United States.
[00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:51.234]  When I flew in to cover Bilderberg in Ottawa in 2006, they screamed at me.
[00:18:51.274 --> 00:18:52.154]  They cussed at me.
[00:18:52.495 --> 00:18:54.175]  They told me they were going to send me to prison.
[00:18:55.596 --> 00:19:02.319]  They told me I wasn't going to be allowed to go and cover the conference until the media
[00:19:03.792 --> 00:19:11.617]  CBC Radio locally found out about it and came down there and then they turned ashen white and came in and apologized and said, please don't tell them I was mean to you.
[00:19:11.978 --> 00:19:12.838]  I have a daughter.
[00:19:13.158 --> 00:19:14.359]  I don't want her to lose her job.
[00:19:14.659 --> 00:19:15.280]  And they let me go.
[00:19:17.059 --> 00:19:23.043]  But when the Polish immigrant, after close to a day of confinement, threw a fit, they just went in and beat him to death.
[00:19:23.583 --> 00:19:27.265]  This stuff is going on all over the world.
[00:19:27.585 --> 00:19:28.606]  Tyranny is here.
[00:19:29.266 --> 00:19:32.608]  And so the insanity of all of this is coming home to roost.
[00:19:33.429 --> 00:19:37.631]  And people aren't going along with it anymore.
[00:19:38.091 --> 00:19:38.712]  That's why
[00:19:39.994 --> 00:19:41.295]  The system is in trouble.
[00:19:41.435 --> 00:19:49.801]  They're trying to buffalo us and just overwhelm us with all this crazy corruption to where we just give up and roll over and give in.
[00:19:50.821 --> 00:19:52.523]  But see, that can backfire, and it is.
[00:19:53.343 --> 00:19:57.426]  When a pimp's breaking a whore, sometimes she can rebel.
[00:19:57.466 --> 00:19:58.747]  It's the same thing with a donkey.
[00:19:58.787 --> 00:19:59.888]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:59.908 --> 00:20:00.308]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.708 --> 00:20:01.529]  Pure Water.
[00:20:01.829 --> 00:20:04.291]  What could be better than the gift of health for your loved ones?
[00:20:04.551 --> 00:20:06.112]  And who better to help you give the gift this
[00:20:09.349 --> 00:20:10.998]  If those on your gift list are drinking
[00:20:12.842 --> 00:20:13.783]  We're good to go.
[00:20:40.697 --> 00:20:41.237]  We're good to go.
[00:21:00.393 --> 00:21:02.715]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:02.775 --> 00:21:04.978]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:07.880]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:13.065]  The Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.426 --> 00:21:17.610]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.254]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:20.274 --> 00:21:22.818]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:25.722]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:26.082 --> 00:21:33.694]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:34.013 --> 00:21:39.235]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.395 --> 00:21:41.676]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:41.716 --> 00:21:45.678]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:45.938 --> 00:21:46.838]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:46.998 --> 00:21:48.319]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:48.339 --> 00:21:49.359]  Invisible Empire.

[00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:02.040]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.222]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[00:22:06.442 --> 00:22:08.503]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:13.726]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:22:13.866 --> 00:22:15.627]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:22:15.687 --> 00:22:17.028]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:22:17.228 --> 00:22:18.669]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:22:18.709 --> 00:22:21.771]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:22:22.071 --> 00:22:22.731]  We're good to go.
[00:22:41.963 --> 00:22:45.284]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.

[00:24:17.619 --> 00:24:19.360]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:24:20.981 --> 00:24:23.962]  Continuing with the fact that people are awakening.
[00:24:24.042 --> 00:24:41.471]  They're seeing how we were incrementally, like the frog in the boiling pot, conditioned to accept absurd levels of oppression, and government in our lives, and government violating the law and spying on us, while at the same time government makes everything that it does more and more secret.
[00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:47.556]  And that's because mega-corporations have gone in and bought up control of our governments.
[00:24:47.936 --> 00:24:49.117]  They're not free market.
[00:24:49.397 --> 00:24:53.361]  They're using government power to consolidate control over society.
[00:24:54.021 --> 00:24:56.063]  So here's the PrisonPlanet.com article.
[00:24:56.663 --> 00:24:57.124]  Clinton.
[00:24:57.184 --> 00:25:02.448]  TSA policies to be reviewed after humiliating pat-down of Indian diplomat.
[00:25:02.949 --> 00:25:10.235]  Libyan ambassador to the United States vowed never to return to America after being confined to a glass cage and groped.
[00:25:11.542 --> 00:25:15.925]  And the TSA, the federal government, they feign amazement.
[00:25:15.985 --> 00:25:19.988]  You mean you don't like telescreens in Walmart telling you to spy on your neighbors?
[00:25:20.348 --> 00:25:21.829]  That's not Land of the Free, Home of the Brave.
[00:25:21.849 --> 00:25:25.091]  You mean you don't like the government trying to push for inoculations?
[00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:33.877]  You mean you don't like the military doing urban warfare drills in every major city, training for open martial law, and the Pentagon putting out reports on it?
[00:25:34.497 --> 00:25:41.638]  You mean you don't like the private Federal Reserve telling Congress that they're not going to tell our elected representatives where the trillions have gone?
[00:25:42.618 --> 00:25:49.640]  You don't like obese people in jackboot uniforms sticking their hands in your pants in many cases?
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.240]  I mean, that's freedom!
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.261]  Anybody knows that putting your hands up and walking into a scanner and having people grab your genitals is freedom.
[00:25:57.741 --> 00:26:03.082]  Well, I guess those crazy people over in India, the Indian ambassador, they're just not going to come here!
[00:26:04.298 --> 00:26:05.158]  I mean, think about it!
[00:26:05.258 --> 00:26:06.659]  Wake up out of your trance!
[00:26:07.159 --> 00:26:07.979]  It's insane!
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.841]  And what's happening is, a lot of people are starting to wake up out of their trance.
[00:26:13.082 --> 00:26:13.842]  And they're angry.
[00:26:14.302 --> 00:26:15.202]  And they're sick of it.
[00:26:15.663 --> 00:26:23.086]  And they realize that government's gotten too big, it's out of control, the super state tells us everything it does is for our own good.
[00:26:24.646 --> 00:26:35.175]  Meanwhile, the government puts sodium fluoride in the water, which every major scientist we talk to out there and all the government's own internal reports admit causes lowered IQ, massive increases in bone cancer.
[00:26:36.717 --> 00:26:41.861]  Hundreds of thousands of people die every year of bad drug interactions, and they know all about that, but they approve it.
[00:26:42.402 --> 00:26:48.167]  You got a better chance of, as I have said many times, of dying from a honeybee sting than from terrorism.
[00:26:49.465 --> 00:26:53.947]  This is all about the government getting in your face when you're shopping or when you're traveling.
[00:26:54.147 --> 00:26:57.549]  And now the TSA is going to be on the streets everywhere, rolling out.
[00:26:57.849 --> 00:26:59.530]  They're groping of you and your family.
[00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:04.633]  They've got federal programs for police to take blood without warrants at checkpoints on the highways.
[00:27:05.453 --> 00:27:07.574]  They're training you how to be prisoners.
[00:27:07.794 --> 00:27:10.496]  They're training law-abiding people that we're bad.
[00:27:11.892 --> 00:27:14.675]  And America is turning into one giant FEMA camp.
[00:27:15.095 --> 00:27:16.797]  Here's another report on it by Steve Watson.
[00:27:17.077 --> 00:27:19.440]  TSA subjects Indian Ambassador to U.S.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.682]  to glass cage enhanced groping.
[00:27:22.283 --> 00:27:25.867]  The Indian Embassy in Washington is to issue a formal complaint to the U.S.
[00:27:25.907 --> 00:27:30.171]  State Department following the treatment of a leading Indian diplomat at the hands of the TSA.
[00:27:31.192 --> 00:27:40.479]  Indian Ambassador to the United States, Meera Shankar, pictured above with President Obama, was pulled out of a security line at Jackson Evers International Airport in Mississippi.
[00:27:40.919 --> 00:27:45.382]  See, normally they'd be flying in diplomatic planes, but, oh, and she had to fly with the commoners.
[00:27:46.263 --> 00:27:54.308]  Taken into what has become known as the TSA glass cage, and forced to undergo an enhanced pat-down in full view of the public.
[00:27:54.889 --> 00:27:55.429]  And guess what?
[00:27:55.709 --> 00:27:57.591]  She says she's never coming here again!
[00:27:58.516 --> 00:27:59.797]  That's how people respond.
[00:27:59.997 --> 00:28:05.562]  But Americans have like frogs in the cold water, and they turn the heat up slow, and we're like, oh, this is like a hot tub.
[00:28:05.582 --> 00:28:07.004]  Then we kind of pass out.
[00:28:07.284 --> 00:28:12.448]  But now we're kind of waking up that the water is actually boiling and going, I might want to jump out of this pot.
[00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:15.731]  And the government and the media are like, no, it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:28:15.972 --> 00:28:17.833]  Having hands stuck down your pants is freedom.
[00:28:17.853 --> 00:28:20.836]  You know, the government trying to forcibly inoculate you is freedom.
[00:28:21.076 --> 00:28:25.160]  Having a private central bank not tell you where trillions of your tax dollars went is freedom.
[00:28:26.889 --> 00:28:34.412]  Wesley Snipes going to prison for not reportedly paying taxes is good, but Rangel only getting censured, a slap on the wrist, that's freedom!
[00:28:36.413 --> 00:28:40.775]  Geithner, the Treasury Secretary, you know, not paying a lot of his taxes, that's freedom!
[00:28:44.124 --> 00:28:48.410]  I mean, wake up people and recognize just how crazy it is.
[00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:55.699]  You know why some of the cowards out there, when you talk to them and you warn them about corruption, you know why they look at you like there's something wrong with you?
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.781]  Because deep down,
[00:28:57.898 --> 00:28:58.678]  They're afraid.
[00:28:58.779 --> 00:28:59.979]  They know life's crazy.
[00:29:00.039 --> 00:29:01.700]  But they have no respect for themselves.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.922]  And so they just decide to laugh it off or look at you like you're nuts.
[00:29:05.422 --> 00:29:08.064]  They look at you like you're nuts because they're upset.
[00:29:08.124 --> 00:29:08.864]  They're scared.
[00:29:09.445 --> 00:29:11.926]  And they've bought into the lie that everything's okay.
[00:29:12.366 --> 00:29:17.229]  And so they've got to continue to rationalize and tell themselves that there's no problems.
[00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:21.592]  And so now they've accepted bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger lies.
[00:29:21.872 --> 00:29:24.514]  Oh, they can put their hands down your pants and put you through a naked body scanner.
[00:29:24.714 --> 00:29:30.838]  Why not put up big billboards with the head of Homeland Security saying, watch your neighbors, report anything suspicious?
[00:29:30.858 --> 00:29:41.825]  You know, why not have local preachers hired to watch their flocks and spy on them for Homeland Security under the clergy response team and to tell their flocks, submit to government, it's of the Lord.
[00:29:42.145 --> 00:29:44.527]  I mean, Hitler did it, why shouldn't our government?
[00:29:45.427 --> 00:29:49.050]  Because the yuppies and others have bought into denial.
[00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:50.611]  And so they've got to go along.
[00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:51.712]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.212 --> 00:29:53.814]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.754 --> 00:29:57.436]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.349 --> 00:30:05.970]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:14.432]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:30:15.172 --> 00:30:19.213]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:30:19.793 --> 00:30:30.615]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:30:31.255 --> 00:30:40.263]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:40.764 --> 00:30:45.808]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:30:46.189 --> 00:30:53.375]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:53.695 --> 00:30:56.097]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:31:04.443 --> 00:31:05.364]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:05.704 --> 00:31:09.207]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:09.227 --> 00:31:11.870]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:17.315]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:17.735 --> 00:31:23.961]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:24.381 --> 00:31:29.925]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:30.345 --> 00:31:34.068]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:31:34.548 --> 00:31:38.551]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:38.831 --> 00:31:44.355]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:44.795 --> 00:31:47.738]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:48.338 --> 00:31:49.779]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:50.319 --> 00:31:50.740]  It's here.

[00:32:09.695 --> 00:32:13.996]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.

[00:32:47.707 --> 00:32:50.088]  That's 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:32:59.963 --> 00:33:00.544]  We've got it.
[00:33:00.584 --> 00:33:07.031]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:33:07.111 --> 00:33:09.193]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:11.515 --> 00:33:17.201]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:20.236 --> 00:33:20.596]  I think?
[00:33:33.992 --> 00:33:51.979]  Michael Braverman, one of the producers and a frequent guest, popular guest on this broadcast, one of the producers of Jesse Ventura's show, Conspiracy Theory, is going to be joining us here in just a few minutes to tell us about tonight's upcoming episode, the Gulf Oil Conspiracy.
[00:33:52.899 --> 00:33:54.720]  And it's now in the news.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:00.362]  I mean, it's not hidden that there's some pressure and some censorship on the network.
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:09.985]  And that the special on FEMA camps has never been re-aired, and they've aired the other ones at least five, six times apiece since the November 12th airing.
[00:34:10.305 --> 00:34:17.549]  I don't know if Braverman can get into that, but now one of the people that's been putting pressure is in the news, this Congressman.
[00:34:18.422 --> 00:34:20.484]  I don't think so.
[00:34:36.377 --> 00:34:50.202]  They've done an in-depth investigation that is just as powerful as the water show they did last week, or the program on JFK, or the police state episode that upset the Homeland Security people so much.
[00:34:50.222 --> 00:34:51.783]  But we're going to Michael here in just a moment.
[00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:55.444]  But before I go there, Paul Watson has a new article out.
[00:34:56.368 --> 00:34:58.830]  I don't watch Glenn Beck very often because I'm busy doing my own show.
[00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:13.880]  I've just been told by people at Fox News that Beck does have a team of people watching our show, tracking it, and more and more in the last two years, much of what you see on his show, the research came originally from this radio show, which I think is great.
[00:35:15.221 --> 00:35:17.642]  I mean, I just want to get the word out and expose the New World Order.
[00:35:18.103 --> 00:35:29.731]  The problem is that Glenn Beck will then kind of backtrack and stab Ron Paul in the back or demonize people that question FEMA camps or demonize 9-11 truthers.
[00:35:30.112 --> 00:35:37.197]  But then a month ago he came out, we played the clip, and said the government's getting ready to stage a new Oklahoma City and blame it on conservatives.
[00:35:39.189 --> 00:35:40.130]  Well, wait a minute, Glenn.
[00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:45.753]  You're a traitor if you say the government might be staging terror attacks if you're Alex Jones.
[00:35:46.074 --> 00:35:47.615]  But then when you say it, it's okay?
[00:35:48.956 --> 00:35:54.419]  Well, now he's coming out saying WikiLeaks is good when he was saying it was bad a week ago.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.021]  And now there's this development.
[00:35:57.321 --> 00:36:02.265]  Glenn Beck channels Alex Jones, economic crisis, food riots, and martial law coming.
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:08.166]  Well, that's what the Pentagon says, and I've been screaming bloody murder about these declassified documents for three years.
[00:36:08.787 --> 00:36:10.289]  Of course they know it's coming.
[00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:12.952]  The big banks that run our country engineered it.
[00:36:14.093 --> 00:36:15.475]  We may be able to stop it, though.
[00:36:15.575 --> 00:36:19.000]  If they think we're not going to go along with it, they'll back off.
[00:36:20.095 --> 00:36:29.501]  If imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, should we be elated or alarmed that Fox News host Glenn Beck now sounds almost identical to Alex Jones?
[00:36:30.062 --> 00:36:42.850]  Earlier this week on his television program, Glenn talked about Pentagon War Games, which featured National Guard soldiers training to take on protesters, holding signs with the words, Food Now, scrawled on them.
[00:36:43.511 --> 00:36:49.395]  Yeah, and I've been to urban warfare drills 11 years ago, where they scream, I'm an American, please know not the camp.
[00:36:50.135 --> 00:36:51.496]  And they say, where do you come from?
[00:36:51.556 --> 00:36:52.977]  Well, I came from San Francisco.
[00:36:53.037 --> 00:36:54.058]  Where'd you get the gun?
[00:36:54.438 --> 00:36:59.281]  And the Marines even have a guy get on his knees and they say, watch this execution.
[00:36:59.821 --> 00:37:02.923]  Of course I started warning everybody and I put the video out.
[00:37:02.963 --> 00:37:03.743]  It's called Police State 2000.
[00:37:06.337 --> 00:37:11.079]  And then Glenn Beck years ago attacked Ron Paul, myself and others, saying we were nuts.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:12.800]  Now he's changing.
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:26.146]  I mean, when you go videotape Marines and Army, even 60 Minutes did, and show them using microwave guns on citizens, you know, people playing the part of citizens in drills, I mean, they're gearing up for war with us.
[00:37:26.627 --> 00:37:27.767]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:37:27.827 --> 00:37:28.647]  It's tyrannical.
[00:37:29.208 --> 00:37:33.850]  And they were doing this a decade ago for a financial collapse, right when they got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act.
[00:37:37.273 --> 00:37:50.143]  It continues here on Beck's website, The Blaze, a lengthy article appeared in which the author warned the military is preparing its domestic response to a political economic collapse focused around civil unrest over a lack of food caused by the financial crisis.
[00:37:50.884 --> 00:37:52.825]  Of course, we were talking about this years ago.
[00:37:53.766 --> 00:37:58.509]  And at the time, Beck labeled us domestic extremists and said the army might need to be used against us.
[00:37:58.529 --> 00:37:58.949]  Remember that?
[00:37:59.209 --> 00:37:59.829]  For doing so.
[00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:03.871]  Beck had a complete change of heart?
[00:38:03.891 --> 00:38:09.735]  Or is this 180 degree flip regarding WikiLeaks' Julian Assange?
[00:38:10.435 --> 00:38:21.421]  Is realizing that the threat posed by those who wish to abolish free speech in the United States is far greater than any harm done by WikiLeaks itself suggests that Beck is starting to see beyond the left-right paradigm.
[00:38:22.822 --> 00:38:27.767]  And, you know, he said that he, just a year ago, thought that Judge Napolitano was kind of crazy.
[00:38:28.088 --> 00:38:29.289]  Now he totally agrees with him.
[00:38:29.489 --> 00:38:31.612]  And we know Napolitano's on board with Liberty.
[00:38:32.032 --> 00:38:41.682]  He came out and said that 9-11, what we know of 9-11 is a lie, and that it will be seen in the history books, just like the JFK assassination, as a fraud.
[00:38:42.503 --> 00:38:52.770]  And the article continues, and we've asked the question time and time again, but to no real answer, if Beck continues to talk like this, will Fox News allow him to stay on the air?
[00:38:53.211 --> 00:38:57.214]  Or is the whole thing all part of a revelation of the method process?
[00:38:58.359 --> 00:39:12.224]  Beck is on the verge of going head-to-head with the same military-industrial complex that will enforce any martial law scenario, the same entity that finds and controls the corporate media which provides Beck with this platform.
[00:39:12.624 --> 00:39:13.825]  This dichotomy seems
[00:39:15.205 --> 00:39:15.985]  I'm glad Michael Braverman
[00:39:36.345 --> 00:39:41.611]  Two years after saying there's no plan to arrest Americans by the military, is now coming out and admitting it.
[00:39:42.252 --> 00:39:44.735]  So, why does he get to talk about it, Michael?
[00:39:44.795 --> 00:39:48.940]  But the episode of police state's gone.
[00:39:49.997 --> 00:39:55.739]  Well, I tell you, it's amazing about Beck and how he kind of flip-flops.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:04.343]  But I think what's happening is people are beginning to see the light, Alex, and you've been out there kind of screaming in the wilderness for all these years.
[00:40:04.863 --> 00:40:08.005]  And I just want to say one thing about the police state before we move on.
[00:40:08.425 --> 00:40:12.787]  And this, again, I always talk to you and we always kind of get into things.
[00:40:12.847 --> 00:40:15.068]  And what I always say to your listeners and to people,
[00:40:16.371 --> 00:40:17.853]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:40:17.973 --> 00:40:19.595]  Don't take Alex's word for it.
[00:40:19.835 --> 00:40:25.481]  Go on your computer, hit Google, and hit the words I'm going to tell you, and you'll see it.
[00:40:25.661 --> 00:40:26.182]  It comes up.
[00:40:26.322 --> 00:40:35.292]  And one of the things that really struck me, and then we can move on to the Gulf Oil Conspiracy, but the thing that really struck me was I went to the Missouri
[00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:38.891]  Fusion Center, remember we talked about the Fusion Centers.
[00:40:39.291 --> 00:40:42.472]  It's called the Missouri Intelligence Analysis Center, MIAC.
[00:40:42.692 --> 00:40:52.955]  And you can go right on, you can look at their thing, and right in the MIAC website, you will see a thing about how to identify a domestic terrorist.
[00:40:53.395 --> 00:40:55.176]  And it goes on and it talks about a bunch of stuff.
[00:40:55.236 --> 00:41:00.617]  And again, this is written by a bunch of, you know, probably moronic bureaucrats, you know, sitting in a room very proud of themselves.
[00:41:00.998 --> 00:41:01.978]  But here's what they say.
[00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:07.209]  Sometimes domestic terrorists can be identified by the third party.
[00:41:07.995 --> 00:41:09.476]  Affiliation that they have.
[00:41:09.916 --> 00:41:12.898]  Look for Ron Paul stickers on cars.
[00:41:13.658 --> 00:41:14.699]  It's right there in black and white.
[00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:19.701]  Generally, people carrying around the movie Zeitgeist might be people you want to look in.
[00:41:20.001 --> 00:41:21.422]  But, you know, you might want to check in too.
[00:41:21.602 --> 00:41:27.345]  Oh, and by the way, anybody who attacks the Federal Reserve, yeah, yeah, you might want to kind of snoop on them too.
[00:41:28.045 --> 00:41:34.589]  And one last group, one last group of dangerous desperados is out there that we really need to spy on.
[00:41:34.809 --> 00:41:35.389]  And that group?
[00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:37.090]  Conspiracy theorists.
[00:41:39.019 --> 00:41:41.421]  Well, that's what Cass Sunstein at the White House says.
[00:41:41.481 --> 00:41:46.724]  He says arrest people, fine people who criticize the government.
[00:41:46.744 --> 00:41:59.533]  Now we have the FCC Commissioner coming out and saying that freedom of speech in the media was an aberration and that the government's going to decide, just like in East Germany, what we're going to see.
[00:41:59.573 --> 00:42:08.939]  I mean, this is really happening and the ruling class knows the people are waking up and so Glenn Beck and others cannot ignore the real audience.
[00:42:09.379 --> 00:42:11.380]  Sure, because people see it.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.202]  You can go on the internet, you can see what these guys did.
[00:42:14.962 --> 00:42:20.245]  Then when a bunch of public outcry happened in Missouri, then of course they pulled it and said, no, no, no, we didn't really mean that.
[00:42:21.046 --> 00:42:21.706]  We were just kidding.
[00:42:22.441 --> 00:42:23.282]  You know, we didn't really mean that.
[00:42:23.322 --> 00:42:24.404]  That was just an internal document.
[00:42:24.464 --> 00:42:27.848]  But we have hundreds of other federally written documents that mirror that.
[00:42:27.868 --> 00:42:33.956]  I mean, this is all written by the feds, and now they admit, quote, domestic extremists are the number one threat.
[00:42:33.996 --> 00:42:37.581]  It's not the foreign turbaned men from the caves.
[00:42:37.901 --> 00:42:39.564]  No, now it's that returning veteran.
[00:42:39.994 --> 00:42:40.254]  That's right.
[00:42:40.474 --> 00:42:44.096]  And, you know, people who think, you know, it's just a bunch of conspiracy theories and a bunch of nuts.
[00:42:44.576 --> 00:42:45.476]  Just ask yourself.
[00:42:45.816 --> 00:42:47.337]  Let's say you like Ron Paul.
[00:42:47.757 --> 00:42:49.918]  And let's say you put a Ron Paul sticker on your car.
[00:42:50.118 --> 00:42:54.780]  And you drive around with your Ron Paul sticker and, oh, by the way, maybe you have a couple books on the Federal Reserve in your car.
[00:42:55.709 --> 00:43:04.938]  You have automatically branded yourself a target, just because you exercise your right to free speech, your right to political expression, and you stuck a Ron Paul sticker on your car.
[00:43:05.599 --> 00:43:17.711]  Now me, I, you know, again, as you, I always say, Alex, you know, I come to this, you know, I'm an agnostic, and I kind of come to this, you know, I came to this with an open mind, and, you know, there's certain things that, you know, we may disagree on, and there's certain things I think really don't pan out.
[00:43:18.111 --> 00:43:18.752]  This one does.
[00:43:19.472 --> 00:43:20.053]  It's right there.
[00:43:20.928 --> 00:43:25.551]  I don't want to live in a country where if I put a political sticker on my car, I mean, maybe I'm going to support the Green Party.
[00:43:25.611 --> 00:43:27.412]  Maybe I'm going to support the Peace and Freedom Party.
[00:43:27.432 --> 00:43:31.154]  Maybe I'm going to support, you know, the Alex Jones Party.
[00:43:32.039 --> 00:43:47.988]  Well, that's what's happening is the ruling class, the private Federal Reserve, that's stolen trillions of dollars and won't tell Congress where the money is, they're threatened by us going out, speaking to fellow citizens, creating political movements, and taking our nation back peacefully.
[00:43:48.308 --> 00:43:50.969]  I mean, it is we, the people, right?
[00:43:51.509 --> 00:43:53.891]  But now we see that Homeland Security is pointed
[00:43:54.511 --> 00:43:54.671]  Yeah.
[00:44:12.899 --> 00:44:22.024]  We run this country, and if we want to get the private Federal Reserve out of our nation and abolish it, instead of it being the second largest owner of our debt, it's our right to do it.
[00:44:22.244 --> 00:44:28.847]  And it's in the Constitution that the Congress should control the issuance of currency and credit, not some private banking consortium.
[00:44:29.227 --> 00:44:30.388]  And here's Bloomberg today.
[00:44:30.688 --> 00:44:35.030]  Ron Paul, author of In the Fed, to lead panel overseeing central bank.
[00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:36.731]  So, it's our country.
[00:44:37.131 --> 00:44:38.412]  We're taking the states back.
[00:44:38.512 --> 00:44:39.992]  We're taking the federal government back.
[00:44:40.372 --> 00:44:41.353]  We're not extremists.
[00:44:41.613 --> 00:44:42.554]  We're Americans!
[00:44:42.614 --> 00:44:43.555]  We're the majority!
[00:44:43.815 --> 00:44:45.036]  We have the common sense!
[00:44:45.396 --> 00:44:55.724]  And these foreign corporations that have come in and taken over our government, and sucked it dry of corporate welfare, and that are bankrupting our country, they're going to be brought to justice through the political system!
[00:44:56.144 --> 00:45:06.332]  And that's why the establishment stages terror attacks, it's why they engage in all this demonization, is because they want to play the part of the good guys, protecting us from ourselves.
[00:45:06.632 --> 00:45:10.535]  They want to train us that the citizens are bad, that the citizens are the enemy.
[00:45:11.175 --> 00:45:19.701]  Michael, I want to shift gears in the time we have today, and I want to thank you for coming on with us, and I want to thank you for involving me in the first season and the second season.
[00:45:19.961 --> 00:45:21.262]  I'm really proud of the show.
[00:45:21.582 --> 00:45:26.966]  I think the second season is even more powerful with the JFK deathbed confession of E. Howard Hunt.
[00:45:27.286 --> 00:45:28.347]  There's the smoking gun.
[00:45:29.127 --> 00:45:37.373]  With, you know, going out and proving the fusion centers, the FEMA camps, the legislation, putting the congressman on the hot seat and him melting down.
[00:45:37.753 --> 00:45:40.955]  I mean, incredible Perry Mason-type, you know, moments here.
[00:45:41.356 --> 00:45:42.918]  You got it.
[00:45:56.032 --> 00:46:01.414]  First thing I'm going to say is I want everyone to just think about this, and you'll understand where I'm going in one second.
[00:46:01.794 --> 00:46:08.517]  The largest single industry, in terms of dollar value, in the world, by far, is the oil business.
[00:46:08.557 --> 00:46:17.200]  And if you take it all in composite, the refining, the drilling, the ancillary products, the infrastructure, all that stuff, it is the largest single business in the world.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.621]  Now people say, well how much is the oil business worth?
[00:46:19.981 --> 00:46:21.922]  Well the answer is, you can't calculate it.
[00:46:22.142 --> 00:46:25.163]  It's quite literally, what's that word, incalculable.
[00:46:25.943 --> 00:46:27.345]  Because it is so rich.
[00:46:27.845 --> 00:46:28.926]  It is so powerful.
[00:46:29.106 --> 00:46:43.860]  It is so... It's tentacles spread so completely... And our entire civilization is based on it, and the distillates are the plastics, the cars, the composites, the televisions... You cannot calculate how much money they have.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:48.324]  So, as Jesse always says, and as a lot of other smart people say, follow the money.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:53.083]  The last time I heard about the wealth of the oil business was $60 trillion.
[00:46:53.123 --> 00:47:00.229]  That's a trillion with a T. So if you've got $60 trillion, it ain't hard to spend a couple of billion dollars, you know, spread it around.
[00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.011]  You can make a, you can cover up a lot of stuff.
[00:47:02.031 --> 00:47:05.114]  You can buy a lot of politicians with a couple of spare billions.
[00:47:05.995 --> 00:47:07.416]  So that's how you want to start.
[00:47:07.456 --> 00:47:08.497]  That's how I want to start this.
[00:47:09.017 --> 00:47:13.501]  And if you put that frame around it and you understand what we're talking about, we're not talking about millions.
[00:47:13.922 --> 00:47:15.303]  Millions is chump change.
[00:47:15.323 --> 00:47:16.344]  We're talking about billions.
[00:47:17.631 --> 00:47:22.496]  We're talking about spare millions to just throw around and spread around and buy whatever you need to buy.
[00:47:22.736 --> 00:47:25.118]  Okay, that takes us to the Gulf Conspiracy.
[00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:29.262]  Here's BP, a foreign corporation worth a huge amount of dough.
[00:47:29.282 --> 00:47:37.751]  It's almost impossible to figure out what their profits are because of all the foreign holdings from the foreign holding companies, just like the whole rest of the oil business.
[00:47:38.451 --> 00:47:42.396]  These companies, as we've said before in this show, they have no loyalty to any country.
[00:47:42.456 --> 00:47:43.857]  They have no national loyalty.
[00:47:43.877 --> 00:47:47.581]  They have one loyalty, and that is to themselves and to the elites.
[00:47:48.722 --> 00:47:52.847]  So now you see, okay, here's this rig in the Gulf, and it blows up, and it's a human tragedy.
[00:47:52.907 --> 00:47:53.668]  Seven people died.
[00:47:54.088 --> 00:47:54.969]  Twenty-seven are injured.
[00:47:54.989 --> 00:47:56.591]  Excuse me, eleven people died.
[00:47:57.632 --> 00:47:58.453]  Twenty-seven are injured.
[00:47:58.473 --> 00:47:59.274]  It's a horrible thing.
[00:48:00.962 --> 00:48:02.703]  I don't want to get into whether it was an accident.
[00:48:02.843 --> 00:48:04.463]  I don't want to get into whether it was planned.
[00:48:04.843 --> 00:48:06.904]  Although, I have my opinions about that, which I will discuss.
[00:48:06.924 --> 00:48:08.604]  But here's what I want to get into.
[00:48:08.624 --> 00:48:10.265]  I want to get into the reality, the facts.
[00:48:10.905 --> 00:48:15.547]  The facts are that Halliburton is a partner on that well.
[00:48:15.847 --> 00:48:16.587]  There are three partners.
[00:48:16.647 --> 00:48:18.587]  Transocean, BP, and Halliburton.
[00:48:18.607 --> 00:48:23.009]  Halliburton does all the drilling fluids and they cement the well and all that other stuff.
[00:48:23.149 --> 00:48:23.389]  Okay.
[00:48:24.133 --> 00:48:26.374]  Twelve days before this world blew.
[00:48:26.394 --> 00:48:27.754]  Twelve days.
[00:48:28.034 --> 00:48:35.957]  Hal Burton went out and bought on the public market a company called Boots and Coots, which is this famous company founded by Red Adair, the guy who put out the oil fires in Iraq.
[00:48:36.497 --> 00:48:41.719]  And what these guys do is they go out and they put out oil fires and they clean up oil disasters.
[00:48:42.579 --> 00:48:43.660]  So, twelve days.
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:44.880]  They buy the company.
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.721]  Twelve days later, the rig explodes in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:48:47.741 --> 00:48:49.582]  Who gets the job to clean it up and put out the fire?
[00:48:50.982 --> 00:48:52.123]  Not hard to figure this one out.
[00:48:52.263 --> 00:48:52.903]  Boots and Coots.
[00:48:54.153 --> 00:49:00.395]  So what you have is you have these companies, these giant globe-spanning multinational companies.
[00:49:00.816 --> 00:49:02.476]  They make it coming and they make it going.
[00:49:03.777 --> 00:49:05.057]  And that's what people have to realize.
[00:49:05.117 --> 00:49:06.518]  They make it coming and going.
[00:49:07.198 --> 00:49:08.218]  They've got the game rigged.
[00:49:08.238 --> 00:49:10.979]  They've got the system, you know, set up.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:12.900]  So they went out and buy this company.
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.101]  Now, does that mean that they knew the rig was going to explode?
[00:49:15.421 --> 00:49:19.282]  I have a lot of people on this show tonight at 10 o'clock who will say yes.
[00:49:19.983 --> 00:49:20.503]  They knew it.
[00:49:20.743 --> 00:49:21.623]  It was deliberate.
[00:49:22.364 --> 00:49:23.064]  The explosion
[00:49:26.366 --> 00:49:31.349]  But regardless, we also know they then lied and said, core exit isn't dangerous, that's covered.
[00:49:31.729 --> 00:49:35.070]  They lied and said 70% of the oil's cleaned up, when it wasn't.
[00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:41.013]  I mean they just, this whole, then they block the states and locales from being able to protect their shores.
[00:49:41.413 --> 00:49:42.394]  I mean this is crazy.
[00:49:42.654 --> 00:49:54.368]  Oh yeah, well let's talk about Correxit for a second because Alex, this is where you'll see tonight, your listeners will see tonight, that you have a big part of the show because you actually gave us the tip about Correxit.
[00:49:54.608 --> 00:49:59.955]  And I'll talk about it really briefly because it's just another example of this unbelievable
[00:50:01.036 --> 00:50:05.078]  A colossal corruption that if you wrote it in a novel, no one would believe it.
[00:50:05.598 --> 00:50:11.440]  Corrected 9500, as Alex, you gave us this information, is a very, very toxic dispersant.
[00:50:11.841 --> 00:50:12.901]  But it doesn't disperse anything.
[00:50:13.281 --> 00:50:17.623]  What it does is it breaks up the oil, I guess technically it does, it breaks up the oil into these little micro-droplets.
[00:50:17.643 --> 00:50:18.823]  It makes it stop floating.
[00:50:19.124 --> 00:50:24.706]  Yeah, it stops floating, these little micro-droplets sink to the bottom of the ocean, where of course they're going to the ecosystem.
[00:50:24.726 --> 00:50:26.967]  But everyone goes, hey, the oil's gone, it's all dispersed.
[00:50:27.547 --> 00:50:30.688]  But Corexit 9500 is incredibly toxic.
[00:50:31.148 --> 00:50:32.428]  I could read you a list of chemicals.
[00:50:32.588 --> 00:50:33.828]  Again, this is all on the internet.
[00:50:33.909 --> 00:50:35.949]  Cadmium, chromium, arsenic, you name it.
[00:50:36.669 --> 00:50:39.030]  And Alex, you gave us the blockbuster of all.
[00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:49.172]  And I don't even know if I want to give it away, but it has to do with the Exxon Valdez oil spill 20 years ago and what happened to those cleanup workers because they used Corexit.
[00:50:50.071 --> 00:50:52.333]  And by the way, I mean, the show is under pressure.
[00:50:52.353 --> 00:50:53.734]  It may not be on next year.
[00:50:53.754 --> 00:50:56.456]  This potentially might not air tonight.
[00:50:56.516 --> 00:50:58.697]  I mean, they're not gonna like what's about to air tonight.
[00:50:58.717 --> 00:50:59.498]  10 p.m.
[00:50:59.578 --> 00:50:59.858]  Eastern.
[00:50:59.878 --> 00:51:00.319]  Stay with us.

[00:52:12.525 --> 00:52:17.810]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:24.456]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:24.876 --> 00:52:30.440]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[00:55:30.806 --> 00:55:31.507]  InfoWars.com.
[00:55:32.688 --> 00:55:36.371]  Michael Braverman's with us for five minutes in the next hour, then Bob Chapman joins us.
[00:55:36.751 --> 00:55:41.695]  Rand Paul is going to be joining us for his first interview with us since he became Senator-elect.
[00:55:42.035 --> 00:55:43.336]  That's going to be extremely informative.
[00:55:44.097 --> 00:55:54.565]  But going back in the time we have left in this short segment, 10 o'clock tonight, folks, and it's exciting to see the ratings going up and up and up and up each episode as people see how hardcore this year's
[00:55:55.626 --> 00:55:57.009]  Conspiracy theory is.
[00:55:59.092 --> 00:56:04.201]  Let's continue with the different bombshells that you can give us a first look at here, Michael.
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:05.720]  Thanks.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:11.103]  And also, I want to say to everybody, I think the support of your audience, Alex, is helping us.
[00:56:11.703 --> 00:56:15.344]  So I want to just make an appeal again to everybody to tune in tonight at 10.
[00:56:15.745 --> 00:56:19.886]  Tell your friends, tell your relatives, especially tell any of your young friends.
[00:56:19.926 --> 00:56:22.508]  And if you're young, watch the show, because we need young viewers.
[00:56:22.548 --> 00:56:24.929]  That's all the network cares about is young viewers.
[00:56:25.769 --> 00:56:28.610]  So it'll help keep us on the air, and obviously that's everybody's goal.
[00:56:28.951 --> 00:56:29.971]  So thanks for
[00:56:30.593 --> 00:56:34.038]  Except for the men in suits breaking into things and in people's trash.
[00:56:34.559 --> 00:56:35.160]  Well, yeah.
[00:56:35.781 --> 00:56:38.184]  As you say, people do not like this show.
[00:56:38.304 --> 00:56:40.247]  And as I said before, I call it the miracle show.
[00:56:40.267 --> 00:56:44.393]  The fact that we're on the air, we got it on the air, and what will keep us on the air is ratings.
[00:56:45.473 --> 00:56:46.413]  Let's be honest though.
[00:56:46.694 --> 00:56:48.174]  You were sworn to secrecy.
[00:56:48.594 --> 00:56:50.395]  Ventura may speak out about it.
[00:56:51.396 --> 00:56:53.997]  Now some of it's come out in the press so I can say a little bit.
[00:56:54.017 --> 00:56:55.017]  People are like, well tell us.
[00:56:55.057 --> 00:56:58.138]  Well, if people tell me things in confidence, then I can't tell people.
[00:56:58.178 --> 00:56:58.979]  That's how that works.
[00:56:59.299 --> 00:57:02.120]  Or then you're known for not being able to be in somebody's confidence.
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:05.301]  But this is not hype.
[00:57:05.421 --> 00:57:10.543]  One of the shows is not re-aired, and I guess probably never will, the Police State episode.
[00:57:12.424 --> 00:57:13.625]  I mean, you guys are under pressure.
[00:57:13.665 --> 00:57:14.885]  I mean, this is a real show.
[00:57:14.945 --> 00:57:16.145]  This is upsetting the system.
[00:57:16.526 --> 00:57:16.726]  Yeah.
[00:57:16.866 --> 00:57:21.688]  Well, there's no doubt that there are people against this show.
[00:57:22.268 --> 00:57:25.789]  And as I told you before, you know, there's certain things I can't talk about.
[00:57:25.829 --> 00:57:27.450]  It doesn't even have to do with the police data.
[00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:28.450]  So it's bigger than that.
[00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:36.693]  There are some forces out there that I know from intermediaries, because I've made a lot of contacts doing this show, they want to show off.
[00:57:37.134 --> 00:57:38.594]  They do not want to show on.
[00:57:38.614 --> 00:57:40.135]  They don't want the information out of there.
[00:57:41.483 --> 00:57:47.007]  You have a huge audience, but remember, the potential audience of true TV is 93 million households.
[00:57:47.027 --> 00:57:47.988]  93 million.
[00:57:48.228 --> 00:57:56.554]  And they know that it's people who've never been exposed to the truth, most of them, because, I mean, they've got a... Look, they've aired last season's episodes more than 50 times apiece.
[00:57:56.755 --> 00:57:56.935]  Yeah.
[00:57:57.518 --> 00:58:02.199]  So, I mean, we're talking about hundreds of millions of people being able to see this.
[00:58:02.339 --> 00:58:02.959]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:09.061]  And what they're going to see tonight, Alex, is so explosive that I don't think people will believe it.
[00:58:09.421 --> 00:58:11.562]  I think people are going to watch it and go, are you kidding me?
[00:58:12.242 --> 00:58:17.103]  So we talked about the Gulf Oil, and we talked about the BP, and I talked about, you know, they purchased this cleanup company.
[00:58:17.483 --> 00:58:18.624]  Now we're talking about Corexit.
[00:58:19.104 --> 00:58:21.404]  And Corexit is this incredibly toxic stuff.
[00:58:21.865 --> 00:58:26.886]  There are dispersants that work much better, that are organically based, that use bacteria,
[00:58:27.366 --> 00:58:27.586]  No.
[00:58:27.867 --> 00:58:28.767]  BP didn't use those.
[00:58:28.807 --> 00:58:29.908]  They used Correxit 9500.
[00:58:30.229 --> 00:58:31.030]  Now why?
[00:58:31.610 --> 00:58:35.154]  Well, the reason is because there's huge connections... Hold on!
[00:58:35.194 --> 00:58:35.574]  Stay there!
[00:58:35.654 --> 00:58:36.355]  Back in one minute.
[00:58:36.395 --> 00:58:39.538]  Five more minutes with Michael Breiberman, then Bob Chapman, Rand Paul, and many others.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.524]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.544 --> 00:58:47.365]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.438 --> 00:58:54.661]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.981 --> 00:58:55.582]  Number 1.
[00:58:55.902 --> 00:58:59.044]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.325 --> 00:58:59.885]  Number 2.
[00:59:00.185 --> 00:59:04.729]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.069 --> 00:59:05.509]  It's true.
[00:59:05.809 --> 00:59:10.393]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.693 --> 00:59:11.233]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.514 --> 00:59:14.796]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.096 --> 00:59:18.799]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.999 --> 00:59:19.540]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:22.163]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.563 --> 00:59:25.947]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.247 --> 00:59:26.447]  Number 5.
[00:59:27.028 --> 00:59:30.952]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.173 --> 00:59:35.938]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.218 --> 00:59:40.241]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.381 --> 00:59:41.963]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.183 --> 00:59:44.264]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:59:47.027 --> 00:59:47.947]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.027 --> 00:59:49.248]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.117 --> 01:00:09.321]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.961 --> 01:00:10.762]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.543 --> 01:00:13.444]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.465 --> 01:00:16.687]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.268 --> 01:00:21.352]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.285 --> 01:00:40.851]  Bob Chapman's joining us coming up in the next segment, and I'll use that time with him as we've got so many other guests coming on to get into the WikiLeaks situation, cover the latest on government surveillance, what's happening with the economy, the TSA, that's all coming up.
[01:00:40.871 --> 01:00:50.314]  We've got about five minutes left with Michael Braverman, and I'm telling you, these shows, and I didn't call them and tell them this last season, because they were great,
[01:00:51.699 --> 01:00:58.565]  But this year, with the police state and the water, I mean, I call them after I see it and I say, I can't believe that just went on television.
[01:00:58.865 --> 01:01:00.686]  I mean, this is a first.
[01:01:01.167 --> 01:01:07.572]  And for those that have heard me hype it, I've gotten hundreds and hundreds of emails going, wow, you weren't joking about these new shows.
[01:01:07.672 --> 01:01:10.574]  In fact, it's more powerful than what you even said.
[01:01:10.934 --> 01:01:13.676]  Remember, this isn't Alex Jones on the radio and the Internet.
[01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:19.402]  This is television on a mainline network, and the globalists are upset.
[01:01:19.742 --> 01:01:22.005]  Michael, in closing, we've got about four minutes.
[01:01:24.067 --> 01:01:25.368]  Run through the other bullet points.
[01:01:25.728 --> 01:01:26.649]  Okay, I'll go quick.
[01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:32.915]  So, we know about Corexit, we covered that, and just understand that that company is hugely connected to BP.
[01:01:33.596 --> 01:01:36.219]  Now we move on to what the endgame is.
[01:01:36.379 --> 01:01:37.320]  And what is the endgame?
[01:01:38.454 --> 01:01:47.100]  What we're going to present to you tonight at 10 o'clock is the BP oil spill is not just something that just happened.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:54.344]  It's connected, and it's connected to, starting with Katrina, and the government's ridiculous response to Katrina.
[01:01:55.145 --> 01:01:58.807]  We believe, and we're going to present some evidence that it's absolutely explosive.
[01:01:59.127 --> 01:02:00.388]  You have the documents?
[01:02:00.488 --> 01:02:01.209]  We have the documents.
[01:02:01.229 --> 01:02:02.370]  This is confirmed?
[01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:03.911]  You don't want to let them know?
[01:02:04.811 --> 01:02:06.012]  Well, I'm going to tell them something.
[01:02:06.252 --> 01:02:07.433]  I'm going to tell them something, and that is
[01:02:08.163 --> 01:02:10.725]  That is the big oil companies.
[01:02:10.766 --> 01:02:12.327]  Remember I told you how huge they are?
[01:02:12.347 --> 01:02:14.509]  How you can't calculate how much money they have?
[01:02:14.929 --> 01:02:26.020]  And big government, big oil and big government are joined together and the plan, the plot, the conspiracy is to turn Louisiana and the whole Gulf Coast into a giant
[01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:28.665]  Oil Depot, a huge oil refiner.
[01:02:28.685 --> 01:02:34.706]  Because remember this, 30% of America's oil, 30%, comes through two ports in Louisiana.
[01:02:35.106 --> 01:02:36.067]  And what's in Louisiana?
[01:02:36.087 --> 01:02:41.188]  A whole bunch of pesky fishermen, a bunch of pesky environmentalists, a bunch of loudmouths.
[01:02:41.648 --> 01:02:42.469]  They want to get rid of them.
[01:02:43.989 --> 01:02:46.530]  They want to get rid of them because they want to have their way with the state.
[01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:48.370]  And the whole gulf.
[01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:54.072]  If y'all don't believe me, if it sounds like I'm just hyping and I'm just yelling and screaming in the wilderness, watch the show.
[01:02:56.397 --> 01:02:58.678]  Well, you know what's incredible, Michael?
[01:03:00.759 --> 01:03:04.421]  At the Cancun meeting, we have the official UN document.
[01:03:04.501 --> 01:03:13.526]  It talks about forced relocations of populations worldwide out of areas that cause a large carbon footprint.
[01:03:13.946 --> 01:03:16.527]  And so it's all about forcing people out of areas.
[01:03:16.587 --> 01:03:20.249]  And you guys got the documents, particularly that that's what they plan.
[01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:22.730]  That's why they won't let anybody rebuild down there.
[01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:23.771]  They want them gone.
[01:03:23.971 --> 01:03:32.742]  They want him gone, and we get the Corps of Engineers, and Jesse puts them on the hot seat, and I'm just going to tell you, you guys will not believe it.
[01:03:33.002 --> 01:03:40.312]  Is this even more powerful, because I wasn't there for that, I was only there for a few days, is this even more powerful than the congressman crapping his pants?
[01:03:41.869 --> 01:03:42.769]  You guys won't believe it.
[01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:47.350]  You're going to watch this, and you're going to see these people, and they think they're just going to have a really nice interview.
[01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:48.291]  And I'll admit one thing.
[01:03:48.871 --> 01:03:51.811]  I did surprise them, because they didn't know it was a Jesse interview.
[01:03:52.152 --> 01:03:56.753]  And we set it up, and Jesse walks out, and the guy goes, oh, that's Jesse Ventura.
[01:03:56.793 --> 01:04:01.534]  He was a PR flack, but with him was this very mysterious Dr. Reese.
[01:04:02.374 --> 01:04:04.235]  And you're not going to believe what you see.
[01:04:04.455 --> 01:04:05.535]  You're not going to believe it.
[01:04:05.555 --> 01:04:10.036]  And I'm right there, and I'm filming it, and I'm producing it, and I'm going, I don't believe this.
[01:04:11.425 --> 01:04:15.488]  I mean, we caught these people, you know, right there on the open.
[01:04:15.748 --> 01:04:16.629]  With their pants down?
[01:04:16.889 --> 01:04:17.089]  Yeah.
[01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:18.190]  With their pants down.
[01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:24.635]  It was 115 degrees, and I'm thinking like, we just caught you people, you know, and you're sweating, and it ain't because it's 115.
[01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:28.858]  And they were making Jesse for the show wear that black suit.
[01:04:29.038 --> 01:04:30.018]  Well, I make him do it.
[01:04:30.339 --> 01:04:31.319]  I know, that poor guy.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.281]  He's mad at me for that, but anyway.
[01:04:34.882 --> 01:04:39.085]  But it's pretty explosive, and I think if you watch it to the end, and you're gonna go,
[01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:42.371]  You know, this show isn't just blowing smoke.
[01:04:42.951 --> 01:04:44.272]  It's not just blowing smoke.
[01:04:44.292 --> 01:04:48.736]  You see these people, you see them sweat, you see them tremble, and you're going, oh my God!
[01:04:49.257 --> 01:04:53.300]  Well, Michael Breiberman, it's 10 o'clock tonight, Eastern, 9 Central, TruTV.
[01:04:54.321 --> 01:04:54.761]  Amazing.
[01:04:54.801 --> 01:04:57.403]  Look forward to talking to you next week for the Pentagon episode.
[01:04:57.443 --> 01:04:57.984]  God bless you.
[01:05:00.503 --> 01:05:02.105]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:02.145 --> 01:05:04.947]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[01:05:05.508 --> 01:05:10.433]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[01:05:10.733 --> 01:05:13.916]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:16.498]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:05:17.139 --> 01:05:18.020]  Or call 800-340-7091.

[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:13.622]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.

[01:07:47.154 --> 01:07:49.715]  That's 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:08:00.993 --> 01:08:03.195]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.756 --> 01:08:06.559]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.519 --> 01:08:10.279]  Well, he joins us every Friday.
[01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:15.801]  He's only with us for a half hour, regrettably, today, because the producer so jam-packed the show, which is great.
[01:08:16.321 --> 01:08:17.321]  But it's a Catch-22.
[01:08:17.701 --> 01:08:20.661]  Senator Rand Paul, elect, coming up later.
[01:08:20.822 --> 01:08:25.122]  A James Dilling poll covering the attempted world government-UN takeover.
[01:08:25.683 --> 01:08:32.184]  Criminal confab going on down in Cancun, Mexico, that's falling apart again, thank God, as the fraud comes out.
[01:08:33.547 --> 01:08:43.634]  Since Michael Braverman for Conspiracy Theory was talking about the government documents they got, this is confirmed that this is part of a relocation program on the Gulf Coast.
[01:08:44.195 --> 01:08:48.298]  From about the middle of Texas on the coast, all the way over to Florida.
[01:08:48.998 --> 01:08:58.425]  And so they just want to set the precedent, get everybody used to pollution, shut down the smaller companies that can't make the payoffs, and then only allow the big three oil companies in there.
[01:08:58.706 --> 01:09:01.407]  Just like the bill in food safety,
[01:09:02.228 --> 01:09:05.571]  Publicly written by big agribusiness to shut down small farms and ranches.
[01:09:06.131 --> 01:09:12.937]  Just like the health care bill, it's now hundreds a week of waivers to big megacorporations like McDonald's and others.
[01:09:12.997 --> 01:09:16.119]  You don't have to get insurance for your employees, but everybody else does.
[01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:18.581]  Nobody can compete against that.
[01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:20.042]  It's all about vertical integration.
[01:09:20.283 --> 01:09:29.090]  But here's the Special Climate Change Program 2009-2012 summary, executive summary, and we've written articles about this, and it says
[01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:35.562]  On page six, forced relocation of populations to lower their carbon footprint.
[01:09:36.102 --> 01:09:40.065]  Bob Chapman, I mean, this is what the game's all about.
[01:09:40.125 --> 01:09:43.166]  You always talk about the double set of rules.
[01:09:43.607 --> 01:09:49.070]  Wesley Snipes gets three years in prison even though he was found not guilty on the big charge.
[01:09:49.770 --> 01:09:52.712]  Rangel clearly not paying millions in taxes.
[01:09:52.952 --> 01:09:55.673]  He gets a slap on the wrist because they're above the law.
[01:09:55.893 --> 01:09:56.554]  Talk about that.
[01:10:00.167 --> 01:10:06.710]  I think, as far as the corporations are concerned, it's a perfect example of corporatist fascism.
[01:10:08.051 --> 01:10:12.934]  And you talk about vertical integration, and that's exactly what it is.
[01:10:12.954 --> 01:10:14.255]  You hit it spot on.
[01:10:14.935 --> 01:10:16.256]  And there is a double standard.
[01:10:17.877 --> 01:10:20.759]  The gentleman, Mr. Snipes, should have never gone to jail.
[01:10:21.499 --> 01:10:26.042]  I mean, they've had far worse cases than that, and the people have walked with a fine.
[01:10:27.003 --> 01:10:29.044]  And they're setting him up as an example.
[01:10:30.275 --> 01:10:35.199]  Rangel is a dreadful person and he belongs in jail.
[01:10:36.521 --> 01:10:44.848]  Did you see the picture where his son reported a theft inside of the government Cadillac that he was driving?
[01:10:45.248 --> 01:10:47.770]  Yes.
[01:10:48.351 --> 01:10:49.331]  They don't care.
[01:10:49.972 --> 01:10:53.555]  They believe that they're above the law and they can do anything they want to do.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:55.880]  It's amazing.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:00.042]  Of this full spectrum of news out there, let's get into WikiLeaks first.
[01:11:01.222 --> 01:11:03.643]  Assange lawyers are preparing for U.S.
[01:11:03.683 --> 01:11:05.543]  spying indictment.
[01:11:06.564 --> 01:11:19.167]  I had John Young, who registered the WikiLeaks name, he really is the original WikiLeaker, he says stuff on the Vatican's coming out, on banks, on torture chambers, on our government trafficking and WMDs.
[01:11:19.828 --> 01:11:21.228]  That's pretty scary.
[01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:25.805]  I hope it comes out.
[01:11:27.186 --> 01:11:27.706]  We need it.
[01:11:29.848 --> 01:11:44.760]  But on the other hand, as you said last week, we have to make sure that Mr. Asai is treated fairly and that this thing is not going to turn into, let's kill the internet.
[01:11:46.633 --> 01:11:47.553]  Well, that's what they're saying.
[01:11:47.573 --> 01:11:49.454]  They're calling it the Patriot Act for the Internet.
[01:11:50.174 --> 01:12:06.859]  And Young made the key point, and of course you were in intelligence, you can talk about this, that they're giving us good tidbits, but notice it's basically a regurgitation of the same pro-war, anti-Iran, anti-Pakistan propaganda.
[01:12:06.879 --> 01:12:11.200]  And Iran and Pakistan both say they concur with your analysis that this is staged.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:23.764]  But there's other tidbits about Dyncor and child trafficking and things that are mixed in there, so they're doing this to get credibility, and then they're going to start releasing stuff on Russia and other enemies.
[01:12:24.265 --> 01:12:25.165]  So let's talk about that.
[01:12:26.706 --> 01:12:41.111]  Well, it reminds me of a typical disinformation situation where you get 95% truth, even though it's regurgitated truth, and then they get their 5% in the message.
[01:12:41.693 --> 01:12:47.519]  That's sort of what Glenn Beck has been doing, and this is what they're up to here.
[01:12:48.019 --> 01:12:50.542]  It's an exercise in disinformation.
[01:12:50.982 --> 01:13:06.077]  We could get some goodies out of it, but they'll deliberately put them in there knowing that no harm will come from it eventually, and it'll make it seem like all of the information is bona fide.
[01:13:07.554 --> 01:13:14.478]  For what's coming up, targeting specific banks that are enemies of Soros, and the Soros connection is 100% clear.
[01:13:14.898 --> 01:13:25.664]  We predicted months ago that Assange is a useful idiot who would probably be burned, imprisoned, or killed, and now no bond for not using a condom and consensual sex?
[01:13:25.724 --> 01:13:28.105]  I mean, boy, I tell you, this is tyranny.
[01:13:29.766 --> 01:13:30.367]  It sure is.
[01:13:30.587 --> 01:13:31.187]  It sure is.
[01:13:32.348 --> 01:13:34.429]  I just picked up an article today, and I picked up
[01:13:35.327 --> 01:13:35.467]  Well,
[01:13:55.652 --> 01:13:58.533]  They claimed in San Diego the guy's house was full of bombs.
[01:13:59.194 --> 01:14:03.035]  He said, this is on record, AP, let me back in to prove they're not bombs.
[01:14:03.496 --> 01:14:04.996]  He's not convicted.
[01:14:05.336 --> 01:14:10.279]  They blow up the house, burn it down, and are now going to convict him with no evidence.
[01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:15.441]  They could show up at anybody's house and burn it down now and say there were bombs inside of it.
[01:14:15.461 --> 01:14:18.382]  I mean, due process is going out the window here.
[01:14:19.743 --> 01:14:20.243]  You're right.
[01:14:20.584 --> 01:14:21.464]  And another thing,
[01:14:22.389 --> 01:14:33.652]  Doing what they did in that area was very dangerous, especially this time of year, for fires, because everything is like a tinderbox there.
[01:14:34.673 --> 01:14:39.394]  And that could have got out of control and, you know, fires jump.
[01:14:40.475 --> 01:14:44.876]  And they could have had a real roaring fire in that area.
[01:14:46.408 --> 01:14:49.710]  Well, the whole thing is very, very suspicious.
[01:14:50.811 --> 01:14:59.137]  It might have been some type of government operation, too, that this guy was tied into and that they didn't want regular cops and media seeing what was really in there.
[01:14:59.197 --> 01:15:00.678]  I mean, this is a first.
[01:15:00.778 --> 01:15:09.003]  And to now have them come out and say, yes, we are watching all your credit card purchases and loyalty card purchases in real time.
[01:15:09.343 --> 01:15:11.285]  I mean, every time they do that, it's a felony.
[01:15:11.845 --> 01:15:13.206]  It's illegal, but they don't care.
[01:15:13.246 --> 01:15:14.527]  They just announce it now, Bob.
[01:15:14.547 --> 01:15:15.968]  That's right.
[01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:17.431]  They don't care.
[01:15:18.632 --> 01:15:23.997]  And that's why I tell people, if you can, you only use credit cards for emergencies.
[01:15:24.097 --> 01:15:27.320]  Pay cash and try not to use them at all.
[01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:30.402]  I mean, I haven't had a credit card for 15 years.
[01:15:32.932 --> 01:15:39.454]  Bob, what do you make of Glenn Beck this week admitting FEMA camps, admitting military planning to round us up?
[01:15:39.814 --> 01:15:52.097]  He's gone from saying we're liars and that we should have the military come after us as dangerous people to now many episodes literally channeling yours truly.
[01:15:53.637 --> 01:16:02.479]  Well, I think probably they know that eventually Jesse's program on the camps is going to come out.
[01:16:03.482 --> 01:16:04.783]  And they're just preempting it.
[01:16:06.063 --> 01:16:07.263]  That's what I think they're up to.
[01:16:07.724 --> 01:16:20.688]  They want to get their piece of the meat first, and then when Jesse's is allowed to run, which will happen eventually, then they can say, well, we already talked about that.
[01:16:20.728 --> 01:16:21.908]  We told you all about that.
[01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:23.869]  And this just proves it.
[01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:28.571]  Bob, let's look at the economy.
[01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:30.686]  Quantify it.
[01:16:30.766 --> 01:16:52.076]  What does it mean when they had the headlines a few days ago dealing with the record treasury sell-off in the last two years and then I saw separate articles talking about record numbers of investors and countries not buying treasury offerings.
[01:16:52.696 --> 01:16:53.397]  What does that mean?
[01:16:55.158 --> 01:16:58.199]  It means that if others will not
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:05.845]  buy treasuries, whether traded in the market or at auction, it means that the Federal Reserve has to buy them.
[01:17:06.926 --> 01:17:08.687]  And they can do that one of two ways.
[01:17:08.727 --> 01:17:16.813]  They can extract banks to go in and use cash surplus to buy treasuries, which is synonymous with cash.
[01:17:17.853 --> 01:17:22.477]  Or they can create money out of thin air and do the same thing.
[01:17:23.257 --> 01:17:25.099]  Money out of thin air is monetization.
[01:17:26.139 --> 01:17:28.381]  So isn't the money that comes from the banks, because
[01:17:29.164 --> 01:17:33.327]  The money that was lent to the banks by the Fed in the first place.
[01:17:33.907 --> 01:17:41.712]  And I think they've been holding those balances and abeyance to use just for such an opportunity.
[01:17:42.592 --> 01:17:47.936]  And when they do that, they don't have to print more money because they already printed it.
[01:17:48.376 --> 01:17:54.059]  Yeah, Bob, what does it signify when we see the headline, you know, record Treasury sell-off?
[01:17:54.099 --> 01:17:54.680]  What does that mean?
[01:17:56.072 --> 01:17:59.994]  It means foreigners, in all likelihood, are the sellers of treasuries.
[01:18:00.675 --> 01:18:07.179]  They can easily control the short end of the market, and that would be anything up to two-year paper.
[01:18:07.199 --> 01:18:12.062]  30 days, 90 days, 180 days, one year, two year.
[01:18:12.702 --> 01:18:21.007]  And then beyond that, what's called the long end of the market, they have more difficulty in controlling it.
[01:18:21.747 --> 01:18:24.149]  And right now, with all the selling going on,
[01:18:24.724 --> 01:18:27.386]  They're probably saying, well, it moved from 2.5 to 3.30%.
[01:18:30.768 --> 01:18:38.833]  We'll wait and see where it looks like it's going to stop for the time being, and then we'll drive the yield back down again, driving the bonds back up again.
[01:18:39.353 --> 01:18:53.842]  Some of these funds, we'll call them, that invest in that kind of security, normally called paper, they're taking some pretty bad losses.
[01:18:54.432 --> 01:19:05.058]  I know, I saw it today that PIMCO got banged around pretty hard, because when the yield goes up, the value of the bond goes down.
[01:19:06.499 --> 01:19:08.760]  And when the value of the bond goes down, that's not very good.
[01:19:10.181 --> 01:19:12.042]  But anyway, they'll be back.
[01:19:12.282 --> 01:19:13.783]  They haven't gone away permanently.
[01:19:14.223 --> 01:19:19.406]  They've been in the Fed, and they're going to drive those rates back down again if they can, and they probably can.
[01:19:19.826 --> 01:19:20.727]  They don't want that.
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:27.282]  Mortgage rate of 4.66% for 30 year fixed rate mortgages.
[01:19:28.203 --> 01:19:28.903]  They want it down.
[01:19:28.943 --> 01:19:33.805]  I mean, people can't qualify it at 416, never mind 466.
[01:19:35.286 --> 01:19:44.990]  And if it goes any higher, the 10 year, and that's what the mortgage, the 30 year mortgage rate is based upon, if it goes higher,
[01:19:45.578 --> 01:19:46.439]  Okay, overall, politically though,
[01:20:01.535 --> 01:20:10.781]  Am I right in saying that this is rumblings mainly connected to China and Russia saying that in their trade between each other they are now dumping the dollar?
[01:20:11.121 --> 01:20:17.304]  I mean, how big of a move was that two weeks ago or a week and a half ago when they made that announcement?
[01:20:18.745 --> 01:20:19.305]  It's giant.
[01:20:19.365 --> 01:20:20.326]  It's a very big move.
[01:20:22.567 --> 01:20:28.811]  In the 10-year and 30-year paper, which is the most common in the long end,
[01:20:29.471 --> 01:20:33.352]  But also what Russia and China are announced.
[01:20:34.233 --> 01:20:35.393]  And you can't blame them.
[01:20:35.453 --> 01:20:43.175]  I mean, who would want to continue to have to take currency like the US dollar, which continues to decline in value overall?
[01:20:44.096 --> 01:20:48.077]  Who would want to keep that when they have too much already?
[01:20:48.797 --> 01:20:50.358]  So they don't want to use it.
[01:20:51.058 --> 01:20:57.340]  They want to use their own currencies, which to me, I would say, why didn't they do that a long time ago?
[01:20:57.870 --> 01:21:00.192]  And I'm sure the other BRIC nations will do the same thing.
[01:21:01.113 --> 01:21:02.674]  And they're trying to protect themselves.
[01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:04.816]  They're buying gold hand over fist.
[01:21:06.217 --> 01:21:08.740]  And the Russians are making no bones about it.
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:11.282]  You know, we bought the IMS cells, they buy.
[01:21:11.302 --> 01:21:18.688]  And of course, I'm sure that the U.S.
[01:21:18.728 --> 01:21:20.970]  government's upset about it, but what are they supposed to do?
[01:21:22.292 --> 01:21:24.454]  Do you think this grassroots monster
[01:21:25.267 --> 01:21:36.414]  Do you think this grassroots movement that started, I don't know, four or five months ago on the internet, that Kaiser's been beating the drum on the last month, do you think that's having any effect on driving up silver past $30?
[01:21:37.915 --> 01:21:38.575]  Absolutely.
[01:21:39.496 --> 01:21:47.361]  And I think, you know, we discussed this last week, and I think it was so simple that nobody thought about it except Max.
[01:21:47.981 --> 01:21:49.922]  And I think that was terrific.
[01:21:50.463 --> 01:21:54.305]  And yes, he's putting a lot of pressure on the physical end of the market.
[01:21:55.194 --> 01:21:57.495]  And they're not going to be able to hold it back.
[01:21:57.555 --> 01:22:00.817]  They were in there now the last few days, knocking silver and gold down.
[01:22:01.057 --> 01:22:01.678]  That's okay.
[01:22:02.518 --> 01:22:04.939]  We just buy some cheaper and it's going to go back up again.
[01:22:05.279 --> 01:22:06.860]  Which it is.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:11.423]  They don't have enough power to keep it down because they can't sell physical.
[01:22:12.203 --> 01:22:13.724]  They don't have any silver at all.
[01:22:14.189 --> 01:22:15.310]  Well, that's my next question.
[01:22:16.132 --> 01:22:28.508]  In your 50 years of tracking this, I've just been watching it for 15 or so, but am I correct from your research in saying that, I'm calling local coin shops, I'm talking to people around the country,
[01:22:29.229 --> 01:22:30.009]  Absolutely.
[01:23:00.646 --> 01:23:03.807]  It was just a piece of deft magic.
[01:23:04.447 --> 01:23:12.989]  And yes, as we discussed last week, you know, losing five or ten billion dollars is not going to put those two banks out of business.
[01:23:13.509 --> 01:23:19.071]  But what it shows is, and you said this yourself, we are bringing the fight to the enemy.
[01:23:19.831 --> 01:23:22.131]  And they have not had that happen before.
[01:23:22.532 --> 01:23:24.012]  And I absolutely love it.
[01:23:25.592 --> 01:23:32.748]  Well, they are starting to get horrified, but more of it is just that the average person out there who's even in the media or government
[01:23:34.181 --> 01:23:57.591]  was living in the same propaganda as the general public and and and and folks are especially people in power positions are starting to realize that there really is a world government that it really is uh... sadistic that it really is a villainous and verminous uh... and larcenous and dangerous and it's so over the top with big sis announcing that they want to have
[01:23:58.471 --> 01:24:02.374]  And they're going to put in 800 Walmarts and Mall of America and Target everywhere else.
[01:24:02.715 --> 01:24:07.698]  Telescreens with government messages about spying on other shoppers and your neighbors.
[01:24:08.559 --> 01:24:13.323]  And now foreign ambassadors won't come here because they're having their genitals grabbed at airports.
[01:24:13.683 --> 01:24:15.484]  I mean, they've tried to push.
[01:24:16.425 --> 01:24:18.647]  You're absolutely right, and so isn't he.
[01:24:18.667 --> 01:24:19.227]  He started this
[01:24:45.777 --> 01:24:55.320]  information to his friends about two years ago and we talked about it on the program and they're terrified.
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:58.461]  No one's ever brought the battle to them before.
[01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:05.063]  Whether it was in 1348 or 1620, this is it.
[01:25:05.563 --> 01:25:09.244]  We've got the internet, we get talk radio, and we tell the people the truth.
[01:25:10.004 --> 01:25:11.164]  And they can't handle the truth.
[01:25:12.145 --> 01:25:13.705]  And so they have problems.
[01:25:14.221 --> 01:25:18.684]  And when they have to expedite programs, it makes them make mistakes.
[01:25:19.565 --> 01:25:27.691]  And the more mistakes they make, the more possibility is more people are going to wake up, and their programs are not going to work.
[01:25:28.372 --> 01:25:29.773]  Because they're going to get neutralized.
[01:25:30.453 --> 01:25:32.675]  And that's what you're doing on the radio with your program.
[01:25:32.935 --> 01:25:33.576]  You're killing them.
[01:25:34.336 --> 01:25:35.497]  Absolutely killing them.
[01:25:35.877 --> 01:25:36.298]  Verbally.
[01:25:37.964 --> 01:25:44.308]  Well, that's why they want to provocateur events, like the WikiLeaks, as a pretext to start cracking down on the press.
[01:25:44.768 --> 01:26:00.938]  And they've got bills introduced, we've been covering them, there's new ones here on the stack, where if you report on any type of leak, which has always been the bedrock of the First Amendment, that you're going to get hard prison time, the system is desperate to clamp down because they've tried to make all their crimes secret.
[01:26:01.218 --> 01:26:02.219]  We have a right to know!
[01:26:02.979 --> 01:26:05.680]  You know, this claim of national security, it's a fraud.
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:09.101]  Real national security is having a transparent government.
[01:26:09.922 --> 01:26:12.322]  The real threat is having a secret government.
[01:26:12.502 --> 01:26:14.223]  We know what those always turn into.
[01:26:14.243 --> 01:26:16.344]  And you know what?
[01:26:16.364 --> 01:26:18.644]  It could be a big turning point.
[01:26:18.805 --> 01:26:24.226]  Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul, we'll call them the odd couple, politically.
[01:26:26.344 --> 01:26:29.029]  And Ron is going to run the subcommittee.
[01:26:29.991 --> 01:26:33.937]  Mr. Bacchus has said that he's going to appoint him, as you well know.
[01:26:34.658 --> 01:26:37.243]  And I wonder if what we did last week and
[01:26:37.984 --> 01:26:45.771]  Up until yesterday, had any real effect on the decision to allow Ron to have that post?
[01:26:46.231 --> 01:26:48.934]  Well, we know if we roll over and don't fight, they're gonna win.
[01:26:49.114 --> 01:26:53.157]  And we know that when we do fight, that we've got a good chance of winning.
[01:26:53.698 --> 01:26:57.901]  And, you know, quitters never win and winners never quit, Bob.
[01:26:59.022 --> 01:27:00.844]  Well, Mr. Bona, his phones.
[01:27:01.878 --> 01:27:06.140]  And I get this straight from subscribers that came back to me after they had heard your program.
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:08.081]  They got on there right away.
[01:27:08.861 --> 01:27:13.884]  And the average wait was 45 minutes to an hour to reach a human being.
[01:27:13.924 --> 01:27:26.910]  But what they did is, on Monday, because of the jamming of the lines of calls coming in, they put it on answering service.
[01:27:29.261 --> 01:27:31.463]  So that they wouldn't have to, you know, answer the phone.
[01:27:31.563 --> 01:27:53.862]  But we told, we told Boehner, but I mean, we told Boehner, here on air, a congressman, he says the name's Boehner, we just quote his real name, Boehner, the minion of the globalist Newt Gingrich, he's a protégé of him, we told him, look, the Tea Party is, and the real Tea Party is going to come to your home office, I mean, in his home district,
[01:27:54.462 --> 01:27:58.263]  I think their main instrument right now is Homeland Security and the things that they're doing.
[01:28:25.154 --> 01:28:25.714]  I don't know.
[01:28:47.725 --> 01:28:55.650]  A drop of one-third to perhaps even 50% less travelers going into the air and going through that maddening experience.
[01:28:58.192 --> 01:28:59.713]  What about false flag terror?
[01:28:59.753 --> 01:29:06.097]  I talked to Governor Ventura on Monday and he just said, Alex, in my gut, I could see him staging something.
[01:29:06.578 --> 01:29:08.499]  You know, people are waking up too fast.
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:11.981]  Well, he's right about waking up too fast.
[01:29:12.061 --> 01:29:14.963]  And so, of course, he's an integral part of that.
[01:29:18.041 --> 01:29:19.942]  If he is nothing else, he's a warrior.
[01:29:20.923 --> 01:29:23.464]  And, uh, they don't want to go head-to-head with warriors.
[01:29:23.484 --> 01:29:25.406]  Uh, they're Mr. Milk Toast.
[01:29:26.186 --> 01:29:29.348]  And, so, uh, the, the...
[01:29:30.003 --> 01:29:35.368]  The efforts that we see by them to countermand what they're doing are not going to work.
[01:29:35.648 --> 01:29:38.290]  We've just got to keep after them, and that's what we're doing.
[01:29:38.570 --> 01:29:39.071]  Absolutely.
[01:29:39.131 --> 01:29:45.797]  Folks, you can call and get a free copy of The Forecaster, 800-686-2237.
[01:29:45.817 --> 01:29:46.117]  800-686-2237.
[01:29:46.517 --> 01:29:48.139]  Bob, have a great weekend coming up.
[01:29:48.159 --> 01:29:49.039]  We'll see you next Friday.
[01:29:50.781 --> 01:29:51.682]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.182 --> 01:29:53.803]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.724 --> 01:29:57.387]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.427 --> 01:30:04.069]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:30:04.249 --> 01:30:08.292]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:30:08.532 --> 01:30:13.335]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:30:13.355 --> 01:30:18.398]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:30:19.178 --> 01:30:26.302]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:30:28.969 --> 01:30:33.334]  I'm looking for America.
[01:30:34.495 --> 01:30:35.937]  We're American and be proud.
[01:30:36.117 --> 01:30:38.660]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:42.904]  The land of the free and the home of the brave.
[01:30:43.265 --> 01:30:47.309]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:30:54.921 --> 01:30:59.493]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:31:00.151 --> 01:31:04.373]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.693 --> 01:31:04.974]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.614 --> 01:31:08.756]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.036 --> 01:31:09.596]  Number 2.
[01:31:09.896 --> 01:31:14.439]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.799 --> 01:31:15.239]  It's true.
[01:31:15.539 --> 01:31:20.082]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.402 --> 01:31:20.942]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.222 --> 01:31:24.504]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.804 --> 01:31:28.506]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.726 --> 01:31:29.227]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.507 --> 01:31:31.889]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.269 --> 01:31:35.673]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:35.953 --> 01:31:36.493]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.754 --> 01:31:40.677]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:40.897 --> 01:31:45.662]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:45.942 --> 01:31:49.968]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.108 --> 01:31:51.690]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:53.993]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:31:54.153 --> 01:31:56.517]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:00.848 --> 01:32:15.317]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:32:16.337 --> 01:32:20.020]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:21.024 --> 01:32:33.037]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:32:33.778 --> 01:32:41.066]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:32:41.727 --> 01:32:51.329]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:32:52.109 --> 01:32:55.370]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:59.231]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:33:05.713 --> 01:33:07.033]  We now take you live
[01:33:07.298 --> 01:33:11.962]  We've got Senator-elect Rand Paul joining us live coming up in the second half of the next hour.
[01:33:33.127 --> 01:33:38.092]  In the first 30 minutes of the next hour, I've got a huge news blitz of information we're going to be covering.
[01:33:38.112 --> 01:33:43.438]  For the next two segments, we're joined by James Dillingpole of jamesdillingpole.com.
[01:33:43.998 --> 01:33:51.466]  He's a libertarian, conservative columnist, novelist, blogger, and recipient of the Journalism Award, the Batista Prize.
[01:33:51.966 --> 01:34:01.054]  He has published several novels and two political books, including How to Be Right, The Essential Guide to Making Liberals History, and Welcome to Obamaland, I Have Seen Your Future and It Doesn't Work.
[01:34:01.355 --> 01:34:02.456]  He has a new book coming out.
[01:34:02.896 --> 01:34:05.619]  He writes for the Daily Telegraph and many other publications.
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:16.329]  We had Lord Christopher Monckton joining us yesterday for an hour from inside the UN Confab, and he said their spirits are down, but
[01:34:17.406 --> 01:34:23.948]  They do want to ram through their relocation of populations, their post-industrial world, their global government.
[01:34:23.988 --> 01:34:33.831]  It's all right out in the open and will cause over a billion deaths in the third world conservatively, according to the different breakdowns Lord Monckton and others have done, if they cut the carbon off to those people.
[01:34:34.511 --> 01:34:37.812]  And they don't care if the climate gate information came out.
[01:34:37.852 --> 01:34:41.033]  They're going forward and they're producing TV ads and
[01:34:41.773 --> 01:34:42.033]  I think?
[01:34:58.425 --> 01:34:59.346]  Temper tantrum.
[01:35:00.306 --> 01:35:04.609]  They are just frothing and revealing themselves and saying, you know what?
[01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:06.691]  It wasn't about rising sea levels.
[01:35:06.871 --> 01:35:07.891]  There's too many people!
[01:35:08.432 --> 01:35:10.153]  So it's their hate letter to humanity.
[01:35:10.173 --> 01:35:11.794]  You know, I love humanity.
[01:35:12.394 --> 01:35:13.195]  I'm a fan of man.
[01:35:13.936 --> 01:35:15.076]  They're the opposite.
[01:35:15.457 --> 01:35:17.078]  They hate humanity.
[01:35:18.338 --> 01:35:19.679]  They hate people they don't control.
[01:35:19.719 --> 01:35:21.060]  This is a control freak religion.
[01:35:21.621 --> 01:35:26.064]  Mr. Dillingpole, do you agree that we're seeing them more and more really reveal who they are?
[01:35:26.877 --> 01:35:29.500]  Yeah, I think the mask is slipping.
[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:32.243]  You were lucky enough to talk to Christopher Munchen yesterday.
[01:35:32.343 --> 01:35:47.799]  I think his analysis of what has gone on at Cancun is entirely correct, that it has been spun in the mainstream media as this non-event, as this kind of disaster, you know, no policies were formulated, etc, etc.
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.201]  This is actually not true.
[01:35:50.221 --> 01:36:04.448]  It is world government through the backdoor, administered by the United Nations, imposing yet further climate regulation on the world.
[01:36:07.069 --> 01:36:12.532]  I mean, the idea that Western countries are to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 to some new UN fund
[01:36:17.094 --> 01:36:18.775]  That sounds very sinister to me.
[01:36:19.195 --> 01:36:20.515]  We don't get to vote on this.
[01:36:20.595 --> 01:36:23.036]  We don't get to control where this money is spent.
[01:36:23.476 --> 01:36:29.318]  These are faceless apparatchiks of the UN World Government system.
[01:36:29.858 --> 01:36:33.439]  And of course, as we know, it is all based on a lie.
[01:36:33.459 --> 01:36:42.301]  You know, a fundamental lie that man-made carbon dioxide is a poison and that it is warming the world.
[01:36:42.662 --> 01:36:43.222]  Well, let me tell you.
[01:36:44.262 --> 01:36:54.609]  I'm speaking in England, where we have just had the two coldest weeks in the end of November, beginning of December, since records began.
[01:36:54.630 --> 01:37:01.394]  The coldest end of November, beginning of December, since the central England temperature record started in the 1650s.
[01:37:02.970 --> 01:37:09.353]  Now, if that's not a sign that global warming isn't such a big problem as the UN tells us, I don't know what is.
[01:37:09.593 --> 01:37:13.635]  Well, they spin that and they say, oh, it's cold because it's warming.
[01:37:13.795 --> 01:37:24.540]  They're saying the same thing in Cancun, where they're having record cold temperatures down there in the Yucatan Peninsula, right down by the end of North America, where Central America starts.
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:28.001]  And they're going more and more into deceptive mode.
[01:37:28.301 --> 01:37:28.902]  On one hand,
[01:37:30.014 --> 01:37:48.559]  They're telling us that they're doing this to save us from ourselves, too many people, Ted Turner saying it's a one-child policy, but as you rightly said, they're now playing along like, oh we don't want anything big, just give us this hundred billion, set up all these new bureaucracies, so it's global governance by stealth.
[01:37:49.319 --> 01:37:58.642]  James Dillingpole of The Telegraph, tell the listeners out there and viewers from all these documents you're going over, what is most important coming out of this
[01:38:00.243 --> 01:38:04.128]  I think what you have to, you have to look at it in context.
[01:38:04.528 --> 01:38:15.061]  You have to remember how it all started with the Rio Earth Summit founded by Morris Strong, the Canadian Marxist and believer in one world government.
[01:38:15.701 --> 01:38:24.586]  And there they set down the blueprint for One World Government, which of course you know very well, it's called Agenda 21.
[01:38:25.407 --> 01:38:42.917]  And Agenda 21 effectively uses the cause of environmentalism as a way, as a kind of righteous cloak with which to advance One World Government control through taxation, through
[01:38:43.518 --> 01:38:52.876]  It gives them the moral high ground to be our god-like priest and then we buy our carbon indulgences from them or we go to a figurative humanistic hell.
[01:38:53.413 --> 01:39:02.156]  Yeah, well there's one thing I admire about these people, they are very ingenious, the way they can turn on a pin, you know?
[01:39:02.176 --> 01:39:19.561]  Okay, so for a long, long time they've been telling us, you know, we had one guy in England a few years ago saying, look kids, you may not ever see snow again, you know, future generations will not know what the white stuff that we skied in was.
[01:39:20.061 --> 01:39:28.225]  Okay, well suddenly we get this cold weather, this inconveniently cold weather, and suddenly they say, no, no, no, no, you don't understand.
[01:39:28.626 --> 01:39:32.368]  When we have cold weather, that is a sign of global warming.
[01:39:32.808 --> 01:39:46.015]  It's a sign that the Gulf Stream is freezing up, and we're going to get even warmer, or is it colder, or maybe there's ocean acidification, or if not ocean acidification,
[01:39:46.195 --> 01:39:47.416]  We're good to go.
[01:40:16.633 --> 01:40:20.196]  Well, now they say the ocean is going to turn into acid and that an ice age is coming.
[01:40:20.216 --> 01:40:23.399]  You know, they said that back in the 60s and 70s that it was an ice age.
[01:40:23.759 --> 01:40:24.920]  Then they said it was warming.
[01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:26.862]  In the summer, it's warming.
[01:40:26.922 --> 01:40:28.283]  In the winter, it's cooling.
[01:40:29.444 --> 01:40:31.986]  But more and more people are seeing through them.
[01:40:33.227 --> 01:40:37.411]  I mean, politically, they're losing the people, but they don't care.
[01:40:37.471 --> 01:40:40.814]  They're trying to take over cities, counties, different regions.
[01:40:41.415 --> 01:40:43.917]  They just never stop beating people over the head with it.
[01:40:44.218 --> 01:40:48.602]  Meanwhile, all these real, serious environmental problems are completely ignored.
[01:40:49.082 --> 01:40:53.264]  Yes, I think we live on a two-tier planet now.
[01:40:53.665 --> 01:41:03.530]  There is one part of the planet which is run by the people in government, the environmental movement, the people in the energy companies.
[01:41:03.970 --> 01:41:06.552]  They are all pushing their agenda.
[01:41:07.052 --> 01:41:11.394]  And then you've got people like, you know, you and me, people who listen to this show.
[01:41:11.994 --> 01:41:19.818]  Really, most ordinary people now look outside their windows and they go, hang on a second, we've been told it's getting, you know, it's getting warmer and warmer.
[01:41:20.398 --> 01:41:21.859]  Why is it so cold outside?
[01:41:21.879 --> 01:41:27.122]  You know, where is the evidence that CO2 is causing all this?
[01:41:27.502 --> 01:41:33.525]  So, the real, you know, free citizens are looking at the world and saying, enough is enough, this is a con trick.
[01:41:35.025 --> 01:41:36.967]  Well, in fact, that's where I was going next, James.
[01:41:36.987 --> 01:41:37.667]  We have
[01:42:02.509 --> 01:42:10.432]  The Indian ambassador, a woman, with her crotch groped, put in the glass cage, and she says, I'm never coming back to the U.S.
[01:42:10.492 --> 01:42:10.872]  again.
[01:42:11.432 --> 01:42:12.933]  Other countries are freaking out.
[01:42:12.993 --> 01:42:18.415]  They come here, and people actually, in many cases, stick their hands down their pants.
[01:42:18.875 --> 01:42:20.536]  They put them in radiation scanners.
[01:42:21.016 --> 01:42:23.297]  They're now putting up at Walmarts, 800 of them.
[01:42:25.069 --> 01:42:30.551]  Telescreens with Janet Napolitano, big sis, literally saying, watch the shoppers.
[01:42:31.152 --> 01:42:32.732]  Terrorists could be anywhere.
[01:42:33.192 --> 01:42:37.774]  But then meanwhile, the Castle Drawbridge is open, the southern border is basically wide open.
[01:42:38.195 --> 01:42:38.875]  That would be like...
[01:42:39.986 --> 01:42:53.575]  Defending some French fortress from invaders, you know, 500 years ago, and opening all of the gates, but then running in and having the castle guards point their swords at a two-year-old in a straw bed.
[01:42:53.595 --> 01:43:05.283]  I mean, the gates are wide open, the country's overrun, and they're running around the countryside training pastors to spy on their flock and look for libertarian extremists.
[01:43:05.303 --> 01:43:09.766]  I mean, this is on record, and they don't care if everybody's waking up and not flying
[01:43:10.266 --> 01:43:23.375]  Yeah, well Alex, I do worry hearing you talk about these things because, as you know, here I am in the EU SSR.
[01:43:24.296 --> 01:43:27.998]  I feel that the battle for liberty has already been lost in this part of the world.
[01:43:28.158 --> 01:43:31.981]  And I look across the Atlantic, maybe this is just a case of the grass is always greener.
[01:43:32.441 --> 01:43:39.287]  I look across the Atlantic and I think at least you Americans are going to show us in Europe the way out of this mess.
[01:43:39.348 --> 01:43:42.130]  You are going to show us what it means to be free.
[01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:55.943]  And you know, my hope is that 2012 you are going to get a small government president, somebody who really understands the problem, somebody who believes in liberty, who understands the principle, the first principle of your founding fathers.
[01:43:56.583 --> 01:44:00.525]  If this doesn't happen, we are all totally stuffed.
[01:44:00.565 --> 01:44:02.145]  I mean, the West is lost.
[01:44:02.585 --> 01:44:10.809]  I see the possibility of some semblance of freedom of a kind operating in the East, you know, but I mean, they have different ways over there.
[01:44:10.829 --> 01:44:21.853]  I mean, I don't think the Chinese set a particularly good example, and I mean, countries like Singapore are quite authoritarian, but at least they have a semblance of economic freedom and that they understand the principles of small government.
[01:44:25.257 --> 01:44:27.699]  Do not learn your lesson of what's happened in Europe.
[01:44:28.239 --> 01:44:31.321]  You are going to be screwed as we are screwed.
[01:44:31.542 --> 01:44:35.665]  And I think you should think very, very carefully about who you elect as your president.
[01:44:35.705 --> 01:44:44.811]  And also, you need to monitor all these Republicans who've come in, you know, in the midterms, who are talking about Tea Party values and stuff.
[01:44:45.391 --> 01:44:54.358]  I think you want to monitor them very carefully because I'm already seeing signs that they are just corporatist pork-barrelers like all the rest.
[01:44:55.316 --> 01:44:58.858]  Well, absolutely, and we hope for somebody like Ron Paul or Rand Paul.
[01:44:59.478 --> 01:45:04.761]  The problem is that it takes close to a billion to run successfully for president.
[01:45:05.421 --> 01:45:10.244]  There's another way to defeat them, to take the states back and then block the federal government.
[01:45:10.684 --> 01:45:13.926]  That's what the founders envisioned, so there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[01:45:14.346 --> 01:45:19.229]  We've got to go at this from every angle and resist and say no, no, no.
[01:45:19.289 --> 01:45:23.191]  But speaking of European tyranny, I'm not really a fan
[01:45:24.355 --> 01:45:27.597]  of some of the George Soros-type connections to WikiLeaks.
[01:45:28.177 --> 01:45:30.778]  No, I totally agree with you.
[01:45:31.559 --> 01:45:32.619]  It's interesting.
[01:45:32.659 --> 01:45:39.503]  Libertarians in Britain, and perhaps the same in America, are completely divided over Julian Assange.
[01:45:39.603 --> 01:45:48.107]  Some people are saying that he's an absolute hero, you know, we should be celebrating he's fighting our battles.
[01:45:48.707 --> 01:45:50.508]  I think he's probably a bit of a kook.
[01:45:51.068 --> 01:45:56.989]  And the idea that, you know, if George Soros is funding something, you know it's going to be a bad thing.
[01:45:57.570 --> 01:46:00.811]  Well, that's where I'm going with this, is he's clearly the patsy.
[01:46:01.291 --> 01:46:03.211]  And you notice the leaks are just continuing.
[01:46:03.611 --> 01:46:05.812]  They put him out there, push him to the front.
[01:46:06.712 --> 01:46:09.153]  I interviewed John Young of Cryptome.
[01:46:09.793 --> 01:46:11.594]  He's on record with registering it.
[01:46:12.554 --> 01:46:19.741]  Then it got taken over by Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations are who openly says infiltrate the web to bring the web down.
[01:46:19.762 --> 01:46:22.925]  Now they're introducing legislation to censor the press.
[01:46:23.205 --> 01:46:26.789]  They're talking about indicting New York Times reporters.
[01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:29.452]  And so I think this is all an elaborate event.
[01:46:30.012 --> 01:46:30.192]  Yeah.
[01:46:49.778 --> 01:46:49.918]  Yes.
[01:47:10.449 --> 01:47:10.529]  Yes.
[01:47:39.997 --> 01:47:41.038]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[01:47:42.199 --> 01:47:44.341]  I think you're absolutely right on the bigger picture here Alex.
[01:47:45.502 --> 01:47:59.674]  There is no question that the system, the various governments, the various administrators in Europe and in America would dearly love to close down the internet or rather limit its freedoms.
[01:48:00.074 --> 01:48:02.777]  You know, for example, Climategate.
[01:48:03.617 --> 01:48:08.240]  Climategate would never have happened if it hadn't been for the Internet.
[01:48:08.541 --> 01:48:14.505]  And you look at the difference in the way that Climategate was reported in the MSN, i.e.
[01:48:14.525 --> 01:48:17.767]  not at all, and the way it was reported on the Internet, i.e.
[01:48:17.867 --> 01:48:18.587]  an awful lot.
[01:48:18.908 --> 01:48:20.369]  But we broke their blockade!
[01:48:20.429 --> 01:48:26.012]  It took three weeks, but their total blockade failed.
[01:48:26.152 --> 01:48:26.813]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:48:27.193 --> 01:48:44.942]  Yeah, well, you know, when I was growing up, I kind of, probably like you and probably like most of us, I had faith in the system, I had faith in the establishment because I thought, well, you know, governments, you know, they're doing their best and they're trying to help us and blah blah blah blah.
[01:48:45.562 --> 01:48:56.924]  It's only as I've got older and wiser and looked at the world and realised that really the whole system is a conspiracy against the individual, against personal freedom.
[01:48:56.944 --> 01:49:05.706]  So many people now are cosying up to the systems of government in order to make their money.
[01:49:05.726 --> 01:49:13.428]  For example, Britain, the percentage of the economy now owned by the British government
[01:49:14.128 --> 01:49:14.809]  We're good to go.
[01:49:44.008 --> 01:49:46.532]  About 70% of the economy.
[01:49:46.853 --> 01:49:52.161]  So Britain is only 13% away of being a communist state.
[01:49:53.646 --> 01:49:54.766]  Well, it certainly is.
[01:49:54.787 --> 01:50:01.489]  And we see powerful robber barons funding the megastate because that knocks out all their competition.
[01:50:01.950 --> 01:50:08.192]  And I found that if you explain that to a grassroots liberal, they stop the bedwetting and figure it out.
[01:50:08.312 --> 01:50:11.854]  They really think government loves them and is going to give them a free lollipop.
[01:50:12.174 --> 01:50:16.116]  All government is going to do is basically cut their legs off to make them dependent.
[01:50:16.656 --> 01:50:26.885]  And then allow only the biggest pigs to get at the trough and feed, and we're the little piglets, the runts, we're going to be pushed to the sides, and we're going to starve to death.
[01:50:27.325 --> 01:50:33.030]  Yeah, well I think one of the great evil lies told by the left
[01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:39.414]  Is that, um, that capitalism is the same as corporatism.
[01:50:40.035 --> 01:50:42.096]  Capitalism, I believe in capitalism.
[01:50:42.176 --> 01:50:43.397]  I believe in free markets.
[01:50:43.477 --> 01:50:48.521]  I believe that people should be allowed to make money and spend that money as they see fit.
[01:50:48.561 --> 01:50:49.141]  That's freedom!
[01:50:49.202 --> 01:50:49.642]  Stay there!
[01:50:49.902 --> 01:50:51.163]  Tell us the difference on the other side.
[01:50:51.183 --> 01:50:52.464]  James Dillingpole, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:52.724 --> 01:50:54.826]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.

[01:50:57.007 --> 01:50:57.908]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:51:00.643 --> 01:51:01.904]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.944 --> 01:51:07.289]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.529 --> 01:51:12.153]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.553 --> 01:51:12.954]  It's true.
[01:51:13.034 --> 01:51:17.598]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.118 --> 01:51:22.823]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:25.265]  They call it a survival seed bank.

[01:51:45.002 --> 01:51:47.744]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.244 --> 01:51:49.965]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:53:01.103 --> 01:53:05.406]  Fight back this cold and flu season with the world's best garlic extract, Ali-C.
[01:53:05.566 --> 01:53:06.366]  Why Ali-C?
[01:53:06.426 --> 01:53:09.789]  Because it helps your body fight viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
[01:53:10.009 --> 01:53:17.675]  Ali-C has been scientifically proven in double-blind studies using low doses to greatly reduce the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[01:53:18.035 --> 01:53:23.438]  Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[01:53:23.618 --> 01:53:28.280]  Studies show Ali-C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:32.202]  One tablet of Ali-C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.
[01:53:32.542 --> 01:53:38.685]  Ali-C supports your body's resistance to all types of conditions and can help lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

[01:54:15.699 --> 01:54:30.382]  James Dillingpole, telegraph writer from England, got cut off with his point about the difference between corporatism, that Mussolini talked about being fascism, that he loved, versus real free market.
[01:54:31.502 --> 01:54:34.662]  I call it crony capitalism or insider capitalism.
[01:54:35.162 --> 01:54:42.284]  And then notice that all these big, quote, insider capitalist TV stations like MSNBC, they've blamed the derivative scandal
[01:54:43.507 --> 01:54:44.287]  On the free market.
[01:54:44.728 --> 01:54:47.909]  But it's government backing that fraud that allowed it to happen.
[01:54:48.349 --> 01:54:50.530]  And it's government regulators that allowed it to happen.
[01:54:51.571 --> 01:54:55.132]  Who engineered the fraud with people like Bernie Madoff.
[01:54:55.332 --> 01:54:56.793]  Going back to your point, James Dillingpole.
[01:54:57.797 --> 01:54:58.478]  Well, exactly.
[01:54:58.498 --> 01:55:11.955]  I mean, one of the worst things that could happen after this current financial crisis that we're experiencing, the worst thing that could possibly happen is that people buy the lie that this is what happens when free market capitalism goes wrong.
[01:55:12.375 --> 01:55:15.119]  This is not what happens when free market capitalism goes wrong.
[01:55:15.439 --> 01:55:29.854]  This is what happens when government regulation distorts the markets and skews the system so that free market capitalism cannot self-regulate as it does if left to its own devices.
[01:55:29.894 --> 01:55:31.776]  That's how it works, supply and demand.
[01:55:32.176 --> 01:55:34.158]  It's very simple.
[01:55:34.238 --> 01:55:35.159]  It's a beautiful system.
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:44.513]  And if a company engages in fraud, they get in trouble from the state level, and people learn that that company's a fraud and don't invest with them.
[01:55:44.553 --> 01:55:50.082]  Just like a restaurant that gives people food poisoning, they're going to get shut down because people aren't going to visit them.
[01:55:50.464 --> 01:55:51.584]  You're absolutely right.
[01:55:52.184 --> 01:56:05.108]  I think one of the terrible assumptions of big government is that people are stupid and therefore they need to be treated like cattle and herded around by the enlightened few.
[01:56:05.228 --> 01:56:09.249]  And we know that since government took over education in Europe and the U.S., the U.S.
[01:56:09.269 --> 01:56:16.070]  has gone from number one to number 26 or 25, way behind even third world countries, because they've been treating us like cattle.
[01:56:16.491 --> 01:56:18.011]  Some people are becoming cattle!
[01:56:18.411 --> 01:56:23.996]  Hey, we've had exactly the same experience in England, and it has been a disaster.
[01:56:24.016 --> 01:56:26.838]  We're plummeting in the international league tables.
[01:56:26.858 --> 01:56:28.559]  You know, we can't read and write anymore.
[01:56:28.619 --> 01:56:29.300]  It's extraordinary.
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:34.624]  But to go back to the original point, I'm sure you've had our old friend Michael Moore on your show an awful lot.
[01:56:34.644 --> 01:56:35.925]  He must be a big fan, I imagine.
[01:56:37.987 --> 01:56:44.352]  Michael Moore made that terrible movie about capitalism in which he tried to blame capitalism for the world's ills.
[01:56:46.685 --> 01:56:48.887]  Nobody likes big businesses.
[01:56:49.587 --> 01:56:50.048]  Big business.
[01:56:50.168 --> 01:56:58.916]  Nobody likes Shell, BP, all these corporate, multinational giants, which are in, they're in bed with big governments.
[01:56:58.976 --> 01:56:59.897]  They're governments!
[01:56:59.957 --> 01:57:07.985]  I mean, they've got their own spies, their own systems, they attach themselves to government contracts, so government welfare, I mean, they basically are governments.
[01:57:08.485 --> 01:57:22.159]  Exactly, and these big companies, they love regulation, they want more regulation, because they know it imposes costs, which they can afford, but the little guy trying to run his company cannot afford.
[01:57:25.042 --> 01:57:26.604]  Well, it's like this Food Safety Act.
[01:57:26.624 --> 01:57:32.088]  It's admitted that was written by big agribusiness to shut down small farms and ranches.
[01:57:52.545 --> 01:57:53.125]  Of course.
[01:57:53.485 --> 01:57:57.067]  Yeah, you only have to look at the example of what happened in Nazi Germany.
[01:57:57.487 --> 01:58:05.591]  Nazi Germany, all the big companies got in bed with the government, you know, you scratch our backs, we'll scratch yours, and we'll get on with the system.
[01:58:06.392 --> 01:58:12.175]  But private property, you know, forget about that, forget about free markets, forget about freedom.
[01:58:12.836 --> 01:58:14.797]  James, I want you to do five more minutes with us.
[01:58:14.917 --> 01:58:15.417]  One minute break.
[01:58:15.437 --> 01:58:27.561]  I want to come back and get briefly into some more of what you see happening going on down in southern Mexico at Cancun and when we're going to learn if these scallywags are successful.
[01:58:27.581 --> 01:58:30.302]  That's pretty frightening that you're saying they may be.
[01:58:30.902 --> 01:58:32.303]  They're playing possum right now.
[01:58:32.803 --> 01:58:36.224]  And we'll also talk about Ted Turner, the hypocrite eugenicist.
[01:58:36.664 --> 01:58:39.045]  We're back in 60 seconds and I'm going to news blitz after that.
[01:58:44.039 --> 01:58:48.036]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.495 --> 01:58:54.436]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:58:54.676 --> 01:59:00.717]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:59:01.077 --> 01:59:08.179]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:59:08.479 --> 01:59:13.040]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:15.401]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800
[01:59:16.121 --> 01:59:18.582]  If founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:59:18.622 --> 01:59:20.923]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:59:20.943 --> 01:59:21.363]  Call us!
[01:59:37.788 --> 01:59:38.349]  At 1-800-340-7091.

[01:59:49.258 --> 01:59:49.679]  Thank you.
[01:59:53.442 --> 01:59:55.404]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.824 --> 01:59:58.627]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.168 --> 02:00:09.370]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.010 --> 02:00:10.831]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.591 --> 02:00:12.572]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.132 --> 02:00:16.754]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.334 --> 02:00:21.396]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.725 --> 02:00:28.507]  We're now into hour number three, coming up in about 30 minutes.
[02:00:28.527 --> 02:00:31.889]  We're scheduled to be joined by Senator-elect Rand Paul.
[02:00:31.949 --> 02:00:36.833]  I've got some questions for him on the economy, on what his agenda is going to be.
[02:00:36.853 --> 02:00:54.565]  If you've got questions for him, you can send it to twitter.com forward slash, you can't even see it on the wall over there through the glare, twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones, and we'll get a few of your questions in for Senator-elect Rand Paul as well.
[02:00:55.663 --> 02:00:57.144]  Who's scheduled to be coming up again.
[02:00:57.164 --> 02:00:59.245]  In the next two segments, I'm going to cover news.
[02:00:59.285 --> 02:01:00.866]  There's a lot of it I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:01:01.526 --> 02:01:04.848]  But James, finishing up, other tidbits.
[02:01:04.868 --> 02:01:09.590]  I noticed on your blog, you point out that we should ban dihydrogen monoxide.
[02:01:09.650 --> 02:01:10.611]  And we've done the study.
[02:01:11.051 --> 02:01:12.572]  Most Greenies agree.
[02:01:13.292 --> 02:01:15.013]  Ban dihydrogen monoxide.
[02:01:16.630 --> 02:01:17.311]  It's substance.
[02:01:17.351 --> 02:01:19.533]  As you know, Alex, sharks live in it.
[02:01:19.573 --> 02:01:21.415]  Sharks and crocodiles and piranhas.
[02:01:22.055 --> 02:01:23.937]  It can drown you very easily.
[02:01:23.957 --> 02:01:25.278]  It erodes metal.
[02:01:25.679 --> 02:01:30.924]  It's the primary cause of the clouds which are responsible for global warming.
[02:01:30.944 --> 02:01:35.648]  So I think if we don't ban this menace, dihydrogen monoxide,
[02:01:36.369 --> 02:01:37.230]  We're all going to die.
[02:01:37.551 --> 02:01:41.135]  And this, of course, is what many of the delegates at the Cancun were signing up for.
[02:01:41.155 --> 02:01:46.020]  They were asked to sign a petition, and they were filmed signing that petition to ban dihydrogen monoxide.
[02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:56.512]  And, of course, what they didn't realize, because they're stupid that way, is that dihydrogen monoxide is the same thing as H2O, which, of course, as all your listeners know, is water.
[02:01:57.432 --> 02:02:04.778]  I mean, this is the kind of world we live in, where people will sign petitions to ban something which is perfectly harmless.
[02:02:05.179 --> 02:02:10.363]  Funnily enough, Greenpeace, I think, tried to do something similar with chlorine.
[02:02:10.443 --> 02:02:12.124]  They tried to ban an element.
[02:02:12.705 --> 02:02:14.286]  Well, it's just not possible.
[02:02:14.326 --> 02:02:15.087]  You can't do that.
[02:02:17.148 --> 02:02:20.291]  Well, I mean, here they are being asked to sign it.
[02:02:20.332 --> 02:02:24.496]  The delegates, this is the type of idiots the UN gets, and they're saying ban water.
[02:02:24.756 --> 02:02:28.661]  And I've seen other TV hosts do the same thing at environmental events.
[02:02:29.602 --> 02:02:32.885]  Penn & Teller got over 95% of the people to sign it.
[02:02:33.266 --> 02:02:33.426]  Yeah.
[02:02:33.866 --> 02:02:35.346]  They're good men, Penn and Teller.
[02:02:35.386 --> 02:02:36.127]  They're on our side.
[02:02:36.447 --> 02:02:39.347]  But, Alex, we've got two weapons in this war, at least two weapons.
[02:02:39.367 --> 02:02:44.048]  One of them is the truth, and the truth is on our side, and it is not on their side.
[02:02:44.488 --> 02:02:46.229]  And the second thing we've got is humor.
[02:02:46.909 --> 02:02:56.431]  I like nothing more than baiting liberals, and I've just written a book about this very thing called 365 Ways to Drive a Liberal Crazy.
[02:02:56.451 --> 02:02:59.832]  It's coming out in Regnery in January.
[02:02:59.912 --> 02:03:00.312]  Oh, good.
[02:03:00.352 --> 02:03:00.772]  We'll have you on.
[02:03:01.232 --> 02:03:05.394]  And it's just designed to annoy, you know, liberals in countless different ways.
[02:03:05.474 --> 02:03:11.316]  You know, jokes about Ted Turner, jokes about all our favorite... Yeah, but why do we call them liberals?
[02:03:11.356 --> 02:03:17.018]  They're not... I mean, grassroots they're liberals, well-meaning idiots that say ban water, but up top they're vicious criminals.
[02:03:17.719 --> 02:03:18.700]  We are the true liberals.
[02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:20.263]  We are the classical liberals.
[02:03:20.323 --> 02:03:21.585]  We believe in small government.
[02:03:21.625 --> 02:03:23.708]  They are a perverted form of liberalism.
[02:03:23.728 --> 02:03:28.235]  We're gonna have you on about the new book coming out, but just in the last minute and a half, what else is on the radar screen?
[02:03:28.255 --> 02:03:32.402]  Are you saying they could be successful getting this world government set up at this meeting?
[02:03:32.882 --> 02:03:37.905]  Well, besides the truth and humour, we also have the weather on our side, don't we?
[02:03:38.005 --> 02:03:41.827]  I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.
[02:03:42.207 --> 02:03:48.691]  I think people are going to get angrier and angrier and angrier and ask, why are our governments behaving in this crazy way?
[02:03:49.091 --> 02:03:52.013]  I see no sign so far that our governments are changing at all.
[02:03:52.053 --> 02:03:54.074]  I mean, OK, you've got the midterms and that, but
[02:03:54.454 --> 02:04:01.758]  Yes, but still, every major government in the world is committed to the idea of man-made global warming as a problem that needs addressing.
[02:04:02.158 --> 02:04:06.981]  And until somebody starts giving way and shows some sense, we are not going to improve things.
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:09.481]  Well, amazing.
[02:04:09.501 --> 02:04:11.862]  I really appreciate you joining us.
[02:04:11.882 --> 02:04:15.285]  But earlier you said they're playing possum, they could get something through.
[02:04:15.305 --> 02:04:17.386]  Of course they could.
[02:04:17.426 --> 02:04:18.987]  Look at the European Union.
[02:04:19.007 --> 02:04:21.369]  Look how that has grown.
[02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:29.755]  By constantly denying that it's trying to grow, by saying, you know, trust us, no, we don't want to be a political union, we just want to be an economic union.
[02:04:29.775 --> 02:04:31.216]  Oh, hang on a second.
[02:04:31.596 --> 02:04:34.217]  It looks like we've turned into a political union as well.
[02:04:34.537 --> 02:04:37.397]  And look, you're now stuck with this currency that you can't get rid of.
[02:04:37.417 --> 02:04:38.317]  You can't devalue.
[02:04:38.337 --> 02:04:39.298]  Your economy's screwed.
[02:04:39.318 --> 02:04:42.518]  Sorry about that, but I'm afraid you're going to be ruled by Germans now.
[02:04:42.818 --> 02:04:47.879]  In other words, the European Union has achieved what Hitler could never achieve in seven years of war.
[02:04:48.219 --> 02:04:49.640]  It's done it, you know.
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:51.040]  Europe is stuffed.
[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:51.780]  Amazing.
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:54.201]  We'll talk to you coming up in January when the new book comes out.
[02:04:54.821 --> 02:04:56.041]  God bless you, James Jellingpole.
[02:04:56.301 --> 02:04:56.721]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:56.741 --> 02:04:57.081]  Bye-bye.
[02:04:57.141 --> 02:04:59.822]  All right, we'll be right back with a bunch of news, then Rand Paul.
[02:05:04.614 --> 02:05:05.534]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:05.874 --> 02:05:09.456]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:09.756 --> 02:05:12.017]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.217 --> 02:05:17.479]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:17.899 --> 02:05:24.181]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:24.581 --> 02:05:30.123]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:30.564 --> 02:05:34.245]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:05:34.745 --> 02:05:38.707]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:39.007 --> 02:05:44.490]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:44.970 --> 02:05:47.931]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.511 --> 02:05:49.932]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.492 --> 02:05:50.972]  It's here.

[02:07:01.269 --> 02:07:04.893]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:05.293 --> 02:07:08.297]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:08.537 --> 02:07:13.322]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:07:13.342 --> 02:07:19.569]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:19.729 --> 02:07:21.972]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:22.492 --> 02:07:23.913]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:07:23.993 --> 02:07:25.114]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:25.134 --> 02:07:27.515]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:41.403 --> 02:07:43.244]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:07:43.524 --> 02:07:48.346]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:07:48.666 --> 02:07:58.611]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:00.812 --> 02:08:01.112]  The U.S.
[02:08:01.132 --> 02:08:05.594]  Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:05.934 --> 02:08:08.235]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:17.697 --> 02:08:19.398]  We are now back live.
[02:08:19.438 --> 02:08:22.461]  I'm pretty excited about getting Rand Paul on the show.
[02:08:22.561 --> 02:08:23.842]  I can now call him Senator.
[02:08:23.862 --> 02:08:27.945]  You know, that drives the globalists absolutely mad with rage.
[02:08:28.725 --> 02:08:34.089]  But he's coming up here in about 25 minutes or so from now.
[02:08:34.109 --> 02:08:37.872]  You know, the best way to get to all this news is just to start covering it.
[02:08:38.072 --> 02:08:40.554]  I'm gonna do it right now.
[02:08:40.574 --> 02:08:43.616]  100 million sign up to report on themselves
[02:08:44.637 --> 02:08:52.460]  On Twitter in 2010, a Matt Ryan article talking about how Twitter's an admitted tracking grid.
[02:08:52.881 --> 02:08:54.401]  People say, then, why are you on Twitter?
[02:08:54.661 --> 02:08:57.082]  Well, we're using the Matrix to fight the Matrix.
[02:08:57.663 --> 02:08:59.203]  It's the same thing with Google and all of it.
[02:09:00.624 --> 02:09:02.605]  Continuing that...
[02:09:04.718 --> 02:09:06.219]  With some of the new WikiLeaks information.
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:10.524]  I'm going to get to that coming up here in a moment.
[02:09:10.544 --> 02:09:11.845]  But let's cover WikiLeaks right now.
[02:09:12.506 --> 02:09:13.246]  Here's Reuters.
[02:09:13.286 --> 02:09:16.810]  WikiLeaks cables Pfizer took aim at Nigeria.
[02:09:17.351 --> 02:09:17.431]  U.S.
[02:09:17.451 --> 02:09:27.681]  drugmaker Pfizer hired investigators to find evidence of corruption against Nigeria's Attorney General to convince him to drop legal action against the company over a drug trial involving children.
[02:09:28.826 --> 02:09:37.171]  And I see it in the news today in Reuters about a bunch of deaths from another drug company and vaccines.
[02:09:37.971 --> 02:09:42.214]  So it's just ongoing, the type of dirty tricks that are engaged.
[02:09:42.254 --> 02:09:45.976]  In effect, I'm trying to pull up that Reuters story right now.
[02:09:46.016 --> 02:09:49.078]  I think I hit print on it earlier, so it shouldn't be in my health stack.
[02:09:49.098 --> 02:09:50.559]  It should probably be in the printer over there.
[02:09:52.089 --> 02:09:57.272]  Continuing, Russian official WikiLeaks Julian Assange should receive a Nobel Prize.
[02:09:57.772 --> 02:10:04.336]  Then it goes on to say an unnamed Russian official suggested Wednesday that detainee WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange should be awarded a Nobel Prize.
[02:10:05.057 --> 02:10:08.899]  Non-governmental and governmental organizations should think of ways to help him.
[02:10:08.919 --> 02:10:15.943]  A source in the Kremlin administration told RAI Novostat perhaps he should be awarded a Nobel Prize.
[02:10:17.654 --> 02:10:20.236]  I wonder what would happen to him if he started leaking Russian secrets, though.
[02:10:21.496 --> 02:10:24.938]  Again, continuing, Glenn Beck is starting to change his mind on WikiLeaks.
[02:10:25.399 --> 02:10:34.804]  Starting to say, regardless of what you think of Assange, you've got to get him out of jail because he's being set up, and this endangers the entire media and free speech if we don't.
[02:10:35.064 --> 02:10:38.786]  Wow, I agree with him on that.
[02:10:39.607 --> 02:10:42.369]  Hackers today vowed to disrupt online shoppers.
[02:10:43.289 --> 02:10:56.941]  On one of the busiest shopping weekends of the year, attacking Visa, MasterCard sites and many other sites associated with shutting off Julian Assange and Wikileaks bank accounts and other things.
[02:10:57.922 --> 02:11:00.885]  UN Human Rights head concerned over pressure on Wikileaks.
[02:11:01.225 --> 02:11:07.711]  The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said she is concerned over reports of government pressure on Internet service providers and
[02:11:08.291 --> 02:11:08.952]  Other companies.
[02:11:08.992 --> 02:11:16.878]  So the UN gets to play the part of the good cop here when they are a creature of the Anglo-American military-industrial complex.
[02:11:17.418 --> 02:11:24.624]  Anonymous, a big hacker group, are running attacks on anti-WikiLeaks sites with low-Orion-ion cannon.
[02:11:26.877 --> 02:11:29.140]  And you can go over that at some krypton.org.
[02:11:29.901 --> 02:11:35.388]  The system that they are using to do that, that's not an actual ion cannon from space.
[02:11:36.008 --> 02:11:40.414]  I guess they're using the term from Star Wars for this particular system.
[02:11:43.140 --> 02:11:46.323]  Dutch police arrest a suspect in pro-WikiLeaks hacking.
[02:11:46.343 --> 02:11:47.584]  This is out of the Wall Street Journal.
[02:11:47.924 --> 02:12:02.137]  Dutch authorities said they arrested a 16-year-old boy suspected of being involved in attacks on the websites of MasterCard and Visa that were allegedly mounted by sympathizers of document-leaking WikiLeaks site.
[02:12:02.718 --> 02:12:05.481]  Continuing with what's happening with WikiLeaks.
[02:12:06.619 --> 02:12:07.480]  I think so.
[02:12:27.432 --> 02:12:33.718]  And they're talking about indicting him for espionage when he's not even in their power.
[02:12:33.778 --> 02:12:37.201]  He didn't engage in the supposed espionage within the United States.
[02:12:37.762 --> 02:12:40.865]  They're just basically putting a bounty out on him, or getting ready to.
[02:12:41.886 --> 02:12:43.127]  This is unprecedented.
[02:12:43.407 --> 02:12:44.848]  I mean, will the communist Chinese?
[02:12:45.949 --> 02:12:53.815]  If I post a secret document, hypothetically, that came out of their country, will they announce they want me arrested for espionage?
[02:12:53.855 --> 02:12:57.698]  And then they grab me and claim that I was rude to the tooth fairy or something?
[02:12:58.739 --> 02:13:00.521]  Or that I didn't wear a condom or something?
[02:13:00.561 --> 02:13:05.805]  And then I'll just disappear into a black hole of purgatory?
[02:13:06.912 --> 02:13:12.396]  Regardless of what you think about WikiLeaks, you've got to get Assange out of there.
[02:13:12.436 --> 02:13:18.241]  They are going to burn free speech and the First Amendment, and they're going to use him as the match to do it.
[02:13:18.801 --> 02:13:23.464]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, the man behind the publication of more than a quarter million classified U.S.
[02:13:23.905 --> 02:13:27.307]  diplomatic cables, could soon be facing spying charges in the U.S.
[02:13:27.327 --> 02:13:28.548]  related to the Espionage Act.
[02:13:28.969 --> 02:13:30.169]  Assange's lawyer said today,
[02:13:31.070 --> 02:13:48.005]  Our position, of course, is that we don't believe it applies to Mr. Assange, and that in any event, he's entitled to First Amendment protections as publisher of WikiLeaks, and any prosecution of the Espionage Act would, in my view, be unconstitutional and put at risk all media organizations in the U.S.
[02:13:48.326 --> 02:13:51.969]  Assange's attorney, Jennifer Robinson, told ABC News.
[02:13:52.009 --> 02:13:53.110]  Well, no kidding!
[02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:58.331]  Torturing people's children to get answers out of them is totally wicked and illegal.
[02:13:59.212 --> 02:14:02.553]  Stealing trillions of dollars is illegal and not telling Congress where the money went.
[02:14:03.373 --> 02:14:08.794]  Having TSA goons radiate you and stick their hands down your pants is illegal.
[02:14:09.915 --> 02:14:14.656]  So much of what this criminal constellation known as government does is illegal.
[02:14:15.472 --> 02:14:16.412]  But they don't care.
[02:14:17.013 --> 02:14:17.833]  They just do it.
[02:14:18.513 --> 02:14:23.876]  And I'm telling you, this is Cass Sunstein, who was at the beginning, at the setup of WikiLeaks.
[02:14:24.596 --> 02:14:25.256]  We know that.
[02:14:25.276 --> 02:14:28.258]  He wrote an article bragging about it in the Washington Post.
[02:14:30.219 --> 02:14:41.504]  And this is a government intelligence operation, and right now I can say with certainty Julian Assange is the 2010 Lee Harvey Oswald, Tim McVeigh, but of the information age.
[02:14:42.104 --> 02:14:43.265]  They're going to use this to pass
[02:14:44.392 --> 02:14:48.093]  Cybersecurity, all this other legislation, this is dangerous.
[02:14:48.774 --> 02:14:51.154]  This is dangerous, dangerous, dangerous.
[02:14:51.635 --> 02:14:54.075]  I mean, what did Obama try to pass right now in Congress?
[02:14:54.636 --> 02:14:55.636]  And it looks like it's going to pass.
[02:14:56.376 --> 02:14:57.056]  Where U.S.
[02:14:57.096 --> 02:15:06.980]  companies, small businesses, can't even bid on military contracts, whether it's putting in plumbing or a new roof or M-16s or bullets, cartridges.
[02:15:08.206 --> 02:15:11.688]  And they can just put them all on a blacklist and not even let them know they're on a secret list.
[02:15:11.748 --> 02:15:12.769]  No judge, no jury.
[02:15:13.209 --> 02:15:15.931]  Just the Pentagon does it and only select groups to get the contracts.
[02:15:16.451 --> 02:15:18.032]  This is the new America.
[02:15:18.072 --> 02:15:20.833]  Just total insider lawlessness.
[02:15:25.856 --> 02:15:27.577]  Meanwhile, you have the
[02:15:29.967 --> 02:15:36.071]  Prince Charles and his haggling Camilla Bowles or whatever her name is.
[02:15:36.411 --> 02:15:37.431]  Camilla Parker Bowles.
[02:15:38.632 --> 02:15:42.415]  There are people rampaging all over London about having their tuitions tripled.
[02:15:43.496 --> 02:15:44.936]  Oh, but the taxes are all going up.
[02:15:44.977 --> 02:15:46.377]  But see, everything goes to the bankers.
[02:15:46.778 --> 02:15:48.019]  See, they don't need you anymore.
[02:15:48.339 --> 02:15:49.419]  They grew their government.
[02:15:49.439 --> 02:15:50.580]  They got you addicted to it.
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:54.083]  Their police state and telescreens and face scanners are in place.
[02:15:54.103 --> 02:15:54.743]  They don't need you.
[02:15:55.243 --> 02:15:58.806]  So the people are running around and they
[02:16:00.162 --> 02:16:01.763]  I've seen the video.
[02:16:01.783 --> 02:16:02.404]  It's pretty ninnying.
[02:16:02.424 --> 02:16:05.746]  It's people slapping on the windows and Camilla Parker Bowles, the Duchess of
[02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:33.945]  Detritus or whatever her name is, the Duchess of Filth, the Duchess of Garbage.
[02:16:34.646 --> 02:16:36.949]  People say that these criminals don't run anything.
[02:16:37.630 --> 02:16:43.377]  Two years ago in Canada, the Queen used the Governor General to shut down the Parliament because they didn't do what she wanted.
[02:16:44.534 --> 02:17:06.971]  happened in seventy nine on the late seventies in australia i mean this is a criminal organization so the the mob bosses son with uh... his hag uh... are all dressed up in the in their strumpet outfits uh... and the duchess of uh... detritus and the uh... prince of puke uh... were uh... just uh...
[02:17:08.072 --> 02:17:09.093]  I mean, the video's online.
[02:17:09.113 --> 02:17:11.495]  We've got it linked up on InfoWars.com and PresentPlanet.com.
[02:17:11.515 --> 02:17:13.316]  They're literally like, Oh, good Lord!
[02:17:13.837 --> 02:17:14.998]  The rebels!
[02:17:15.318 --> 02:17:17.700]  Put more fluoride in their water immediately!
[02:17:18.060 --> 02:17:19.001]  Brain damage them!
[02:17:19.221 --> 02:17:21.803]  Their IQs aren't dropping enough or fast enough!
[02:17:22.083 --> 02:17:24.866]  They're not submitting to us!
[02:17:25.346 --> 02:17:26.887]  More surveillance cameras!
[02:17:27.208 --> 02:17:28.308]  More armed troops!
[02:17:28.409 --> 02:17:30.230]  More police state immediately!
[02:17:34.073 --> 02:17:35.416]  I mean, look at that!
[02:17:35.757 --> 02:17:38.644]  It's a frightening prospect!
[02:17:39.165 --> 02:17:39.987]  Horrifying!
[02:17:40.027 --> 02:17:40.809]  The rallies!
[02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:42.834]  They're saying off with their heads!
[02:17:45.188 --> 02:18:12.777]  No, I mean, that's what they're doing, and the victims are like, oh, the roaches are scurrying about, and Prince Philip has tried to eliminate them, and we've overrun the nation with brooding foreigners we can use to put into the police force, and the CPS to kidnap their children, but these filthy Brits, who don't like our German royal family, that runs everything, the Saxe-Coburg-Guthers, and we will deal with them.
[02:18:13.817 --> 02:18:23.422]  I mean, literally, Charles looked even more effeminate than his wife, just going, oh, protect me, royal God!
[02:18:24.263 --> 02:18:25.563]  But, excuse me, I'm sorry.
[02:18:27.684 --> 02:18:31.006]  You can tell, both of them almost did a Queen Elizabeth II in their pants.
[02:18:32.027 --> 02:18:41.932]  You know, I don't usually do potty humor, but around the office, when somebody's got to get out of a meeting or something, they're like, I'm sorry, it'll just be a Rockefeller.
[02:18:43.087 --> 02:18:48.450]  Uh, you know, that means a quick, you know, minute or two, but sometimes they go, hey, I gotta do a Queen Elizabeth.
[02:18:49.071 --> 02:18:49.551]  The second.
[02:18:49.971 --> 02:18:50.431]  Number two.
[02:18:51.292 --> 02:18:52.072]  And, uh, all right.
[02:18:52.472 --> 02:18:54.193]  Folks, I apologize to our radio stations.
[02:18:54.213 --> 02:19:04.559]  It's a very family-friendly, clean show, but when I started imitating the royals, I, uh... The rabble fills the moment, look at them running around like vermin in the streets, uh.
[02:19:04.939 --> 02:19:09.462]  I can't wait for our world government extermination forces in place to remove as many of them as
[02:19:09.582 --> 02:19:10.263]  Impossible!
[02:19:10.283 --> 02:19:29.317]  Oh, I love sucking off of them, but goodness, I like to go out to the theater dressed up like an effeminate peacock with all of my medals, festooning my breast with my hagglet wearing a giant crown on her head, but to actually see them turn against me, I guess all those PR shows we finance
[02:19:29.717 --> 02:19:32.101]  Telling them how weak and pathetic we are aren't working.
[02:19:32.121 --> 02:19:35.586]  They actually know that we're the ones sucking everything out of them.
[02:19:36.006 --> 02:19:42.816]  I just lectured them last month that they shouldn't take a hot bath, but I have royal trains and 77 aircraft and 94 palaces.
[02:19:46.061 --> 02:20:00.317]  But they shouldn't be able to take a hot bath, and I'm so pleased that the old ladies have to ride in the buses to stay warm now, because they can't pay for their gas allowance, but now we're heating all of our palaces quite nicely, and after we've exterminated all of you, we're gonna have plenty!

[02:21:04.508 --> 02:21:05.429]  Tyranny is here.
[02:21:05.769 --> 02:21:09.412]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:21:09.432 --> 02:21:11.914]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:21:11.934 --> 02:21:17.378]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:21:17.799 --> 02:21:24.024]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:21:24.464 --> 02:21:30.005]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:21:30.446 --> 02:21:34.107]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:21:34.607 --> 02:21:38.648]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:21:38.888 --> 02:21:44.429]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:21:44.849 --> 02:21:47.830]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:21:48.390 --> 02:21:49.811]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:21:50.371 --> 02:21:50.811]  It's here.

[02:22:28.923 --> 02:22:30.004]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:30.164 --> 02:22:34.487]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:34.667 --> 02:22:40.371]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:40.471 --> 02:22:43.893]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:44.113 --> 02:22:46.715]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:46.835 --> 02:22:51.738]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:51.898 --> 02:22:52.119]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:52.139 --> 02:22:53.540]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:59.163 --> 02:23:02.444]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:23:03.245 --> 02:23:07.486]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:23:07.766 --> 02:23:13.689]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:23:13.909 --> 02:23:16.050]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:23:16.350 --> 02:23:22.312]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:23:22.432 --> 02:23:25.776]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:23:25.856 --> 02:23:27.558]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:23:27.718 --> 02:23:29.760]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:23:29.901 --> 02:23:34.566]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.

[02:23:48.635 --> 02:23:49.896]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[02:24:17.037 --> 02:24:18.098]  We are back live.
[02:24:18.118 --> 02:24:32.048]  I mentioned some of this yesterday but I want to get back into it because I need to write an article about this or make a video about it because for 15 years I've known about the government worldwide
[02:24:33.109 --> 02:24:45.417]  In every Western nation, from Australia to the US, from Canada to England, from Germany to Denmark, taking people's blood at birth and putting it in a UN-financed global government database.
[02:24:46.778 --> 02:24:55.304]  And finally, lawsuits got filed by some of my listeners in Minnesota over this, and in Texas, and they've won, and they found out that, yes, it's an army database.
[02:24:55.344 --> 02:24:56.184]  Well, it's more than that.
[02:24:56.765 --> 02:25:00.067]  Look, I was sent the documents almost 15 years ago by a nurse in San Antonio.
[02:25:02.339 --> 02:25:05.984]  And Jason Douglas wrote a great article, but he's going off what the media said.
[02:25:06.024 --> 02:25:09.208]  You know, 2002, Texas started taking blood.
[02:25:09.228 --> 02:25:09.268]  No.
[02:25:09.288 --> 02:25:19.962]  39 years ago, worldwide, they began taking blood from all newborns and lying and saying it's got to be sent to the health department to do a blood test.
[02:25:21.496 --> 02:25:22.536]  They take two sets.
[02:25:22.576 --> 02:25:24.777]  They do the blood test at the hospital or send it to a lab.
[02:25:25.077 --> 02:25:28.198]  That blood goes and is being kept and sold to pharma companies.
[02:25:28.739 --> 02:25:32.880]  And they've had cases where they patented certain proteins and things in your blood.
[02:25:32.900 --> 02:25:35.401]  And then when you go to get genetic treatment later, guess what?
[02:25:35.421 --> 02:25:36.541]  They've already got you on file.
[02:25:37.542 --> 02:25:39.743]  And it's for eugenics and bioweapons development.
[02:25:40.103 --> 02:25:41.043]  That's all come out.
[02:25:42.784 --> 02:25:43.004]  So...
[02:25:45.278 --> 02:25:53.804]  It's so frustrating that even now that this is admitted, that I must not have done my job, because people don't even know the tip of the iceberg.
[02:25:54.684 --> 02:26:05.973]  But there's a whitewash out of KXAN, the statesman had one, and they go on to admit that in the last lawsuit the government settled, they admitted that they were selling it to the Army.
[02:26:06.973 --> 02:26:08.354]  Well, it's not just that, it's a state law.
[02:26:09.548 --> 02:26:15.329]  You know, they claim, oh, it's a state law we test the blood for for the diseases, but it's a state law to get your blood to give to the army.
[02:26:15.609 --> 02:26:19.470]  It's illegal what they're doing with it, but they have the law about collecting it.
[02:26:20.211 --> 02:26:21.571]  And the law is on the hospitals.
[02:26:21.611 --> 02:26:22.851]  You as a parent don't have to do it.
[02:26:23.171 --> 02:26:24.792]  It's a law that they have to attempt it.
[02:26:27.052 --> 02:26:34.814]  And there's now a class action suit been filed over newborn babies' blood going to the Pentagon, going to private companies, and
[02:26:36.812 --> 02:26:42.917]  At the end of it, the government says it's preposterous that we've got a DNA database.
[02:26:43.638 --> 02:26:48.802]  They say a minute before on the TV piece and in the paper that that's what the lawsuit showed.
[02:26:50.664 --> 02:26:52.446]  But those documents are all public now.
[02:26:52.566 --> 02:26:54.788]  This stuff, anybody did the research, it's all out there.
[02:26:55.993 --> 02:26:56.754]  Okay?
[02:26:56.834 --> 02:27:06.460]  For 39 years, if you were born in New Zealand, Australia, England, Canada, the United States, Western Europe, we've already been under a global government.
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:07.681]  It's all standardized.
[02:27:09.422 --> 02:27:13.644]  We've got Head Start, they've got Secure Start, you know, in Europe and other areas.
[02:27:14.565 --> 02:27:17.627]  We've got telescreens, barking orders, they've got them going in England.
[02:27:20.449 --> 02:27:21.830]  I mean, it's the same deal.
[02:27:22.270 --> 02:27:23.611]  It's continuity of agenda.
[02:27:24.970 --> 02:27:26.851]  And people better wake up to that.
[02:27:28.732 --> 02:27:29.412]  Here's another one.
[02:27:29.652 --> 02:27:33.834]  The Texas Tribune lawsuit alleges DSHS sold baby DNA samples.
[02:27:34.094 --> 02:27:34.895]  That's admitted!
[02:27:35.275 --> 02:27:39.417]  You can't get the mainstream media around here to report on what's admitted.
[02:27:41.018 --> 02:27:46.240]  It'd be like if the space shuttle took off and flew into orbit, they'd say, allegedly the space shuttle took off.
[02:27:46.380 --> 02:27:50.042]  Or if the sun came up, they have a headline, allegedly the sun came up.
[02:27:51.257 --> 02:28:02.638]  But then, somebody goes on a message board and says they're Osama Bin Laden, and they're gonna attack, and the AP and Reuters run headlines, Bin Laden says he's gonna attack, and then later they say, this came from a message board.
[02:28:05.373 --> 02:28:06.774]  See, they're always playing it down.
[02:28:07.194 --> 02:28:11.597]  And I'm not saying these writers at KXAN or The Statesman are government agents.
[02:28:12.018 --> 02:28:17.842]  They've already bought into tyranny and that this is all for their own good and government loves them and they're childlike in their mentality.
[02:28:17.882 --> 02:28:19.643]  So, well, it can't be true.
[02:28:19.683 --> 02:28:20.864]  They sold it secretly.
[02:28:20.904 --> 02:28:21.745]  That's a little scary.
[02:28:21.785 --> 02:28:24.807]  So, even though it's admitted they did, we'll just say it's alleged.
[02:28:24.867 --> 02:28:26.168]  So, we all feel better.
[02:28:27.807 --> 02:28:33.248]  You know, we don't want to create mistrust of the government because civically the right thing to do is to teach trust.
[02:28:33.628 --> 02:28:37.489]  You know, they teach in journalism school in this country to teach trust of the government.
[02:28:38.670 --> 02:28:43.371]  What does Congressman Cohen trying to shut down Jesse Ventura's TV show say in his editorial?
[02:28:43.751 --> 02:28:47.832]  He says that, you know, we've got to have a media that teaches people to trust the government.
[02:28:49.492 --> 02:28:51.193]  That's how out of touch they are.
[02:28:52.881 --> 02:28:54.523]  The government thinks you're capital.
[02:28:54.723 --> 02:28:56.445]  They stick their hands down your pants.
[02:28:56.545 --> 02:28:57.586]  They put you in scanners.
[02:28:57.866 --> 02:29:01.290]  They're taking blood samples at checkpoints warrantlessly under federal grants.
[02:29:01.570 --> 02:29:03.012]  Local police are being federalized.
[02:29:03.272 --> 02:29:04.674]  They're spying on everything you do.
[02:29:06.451 --> 02:29:09.775]  It's out of control, and it needs to stop.
[02:29:10.576 --> 02:29:16.542]  You know, we're about to go to break and come back with Senator-elect Rand Paul, hopefully, because he's a busy schedule.
[02:29:17.563 --> 02:29:20.106]  I do just want to remind folks, this show is listener-supported.

[02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:51.580]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:53.581]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.602 --> 02:29:57.343]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.444 --> 02:30:02.044]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[02:30:53.767 --> 02:30:54.207]  Thank you!
[02:31:00.011 --> 02:31:04.234]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.555 --> 02:31:05.175]  Number one.
[02:31:05.475 --> 02:31:08.618]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:08.898 --> 02:31:09.458]  Number two.
[02:31:09.759 --> 02:31:14.302]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.642 --> 02:31:15.083]  It's true.
[02:31:15.383 --> 02:31:19.946]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.267 --> 02:31:20.807]  Number three.
[02:31:21.087 --> 02:31:24.370]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:24.670 --> 02:31:28.373]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.573 --> 02:31:29.133]  Number four.
[02:31:29.373 --> 02:31:31.734]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.134 --> 02:31:35.496]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:35.816 --> 02:31:36.356]  Number five.
[02:31:36.596 --> 02:31:40.518]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:40.738 --> 02:31:45.520]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:35.508 --> 02:32:38.230]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:32:54.306 --> 02:32:57.408]  Alright, he's promised to come back in the New Year for longer.
[02:32:57.828 --> 02:33:10.476]  We've only got him for about 10-15 minutes right now.
[02:33:12.798 --> 02:33:13.098]  How amazing
[02:33:20.114 --> 02:33:23.435]  Senator-elect Rand Paul going to the Senate.
[02:33:24.436 --> 02:33:27.077]  Senator, I just want to say congratulations to you.
[02:33:27.517 --> 02:33:28.197]  Well, thank you.
[02:33:28.217 --> 02:33:29.538]  It's good to be with you again, Alex.
[02:33:31.018 --> 02:33:37.140]  My first question is, they threw everything they could at you, one of the biggest demonization campaigns in modern history.
[02:33:37.240 --> 02:33:37.841]  It failed.
[02:33:38.221 --> 02:33:42.022]  What does that say about the dinosaur corporate establishment media?
[02:33:42.843 --> 02:33:49.125]  Well, I think it's amazing that, you know, not only did they throw the kitchen sink at us, they made up a few things along the way.
[02:33:49.904 --> 02:33:54.271]  But what I would say is that the mainstream media doesn't control the process anymore.
[02:33:54.311 --> 02:33:57.616]  I think there are so many other outlets where people are getting their news.
[02:33:58.537 --> 02:33:59.919]  Talk radio is a big one.
[02:33:59.939 --> 02:34:01.782]  The Internet's another big one.
[02:34:02.518 --> 02:34:24.482]  And I think also that the scare tactics of saying, oh, so-and-so is going to take away or cut off your grandmother's Social Security doesn't work anymore because people realize that if we do nothing, no one will have Social Security, no one will have Medicare, because the politicians have basically spent all the money, and there has to be some reform.
[02:34:24.522 --> 02:34:28.143]  Whether you like it or not, there's going to have to be some kind of entitlement reform.
[02:34:28.343 --> 02:34:31.205]  Well, moving quickly through these questions, again, you're gracious to join us.
[02:34:31.885 --> 02:34:42.731]  Obviously, I'm sure you know that Cass Sunstein at the White House, the Commissar, excuse me, Commissioner of the FCC, said freedom without government control of media was an aberration.
[02:34:43.031 --> 02:34:46.713]  They're really moving in right now to try to curtail free speech.
[02:34:47.313 --> 02:34:49.134]  What's your concern with that, Senator?
[02:34:49.824 --> 02:35:04.383]  Well, it's funny, I've been concerned about the Fairness Doctrine ever since I was a teenager, and I can remember writing to a conservative leader back then, and the conservative leader said, oh, we need a Fairness Doctrine because the liberals are controlling all the radio and the television.
[02:35:04.924 --> 02:35:06.364]  Now it's funny, it's the opposite.
[02:35:06.404 --> 02:35:11.326]  Now that there's more conservative commentators, the liberals want to stifle the conservatives.
[02:35:11.686 --> 02:35:24.369]  But I think free speech is free speech, whether it's a liberal commentator or a conservative commentator, and that we shouldn't have the government involved in deciding what we hear on the radio waves, what we read in the newspaper, what is written in books.
[02:35:26.306 --> 02:35:42.577]  Senator, obviously you're watching the lame-duck Congress try to legalize illegal aliens with the DREAM Act, trying to further gut society, trying to pass the Food Safety Bill, which was written by Big Agra to shut down local farms and ranches.
[02:35:44.078 --> 02:35:47.840]  Boy, I tell you, they are really showing how disconnected they are.
[02:35:48.521 --> 02:35:55.766]  Are you going to try to lead in the Senate to make sure that whatever horrible things they do, like Obamacare and other things, are repealed?
[02:35:56.626 --> 02:36:06.557]  Absolutely, and the other thing is, is you gotta wonder why when we just had such a big historic mandate of an election, that they're trying to ram all these things through in a lame duck.
[02:36:06.577 --> 02:36:10.441]  Of course we know why, but the thing is, is we shouldn't let them do it.
[02:36:10.481 --> 02:36:17.309]  The people have spoken and elected, you know, nearly a hundred new people in the House, thirteen new people in the Senate,
[02:36:17.876 --> 02:36:23.242]  That we need to wait until the electoral process has been allowed to occur and the new people get there.
[02:36:23.682 --> 02:36:27.947]  So yes, anything they try to do in this session, I think we will try to reverse.
[02:36:28.728 --> 02:36:31.611]  And I think that you're already hearing people.
[02:36:31.631 --> 02:36:34.534]  You know, people are saying that let's wait for the new people.
[02:36:34.574 --> 02:36:36.276]  That's what Senator DeMint said today.
[02:36:36.316 --> 02:36:37.497]  Let's wait for the new senators.
[02:36:38.576 --> 02:36:39.236]  Absolutely.
[02:36:39.276 --> 02:36:46.618]  They've certainly been rebuked in their activities, but they're like a bunch of drunken sailors trying to steal as much as they can.
[02:36:47.338 --> 02:36:55.340]  Speaking of your father, headline, Ron Paul, author of In the Fed, to lead a panel overseeing Central Bank.
[02:36:56.120 --> 02:37:03.742]  Are you going to join with your father in an attempt to get rid of the private Federal Reserve System that won't tell Congress where the trillions went?
[02:37:04.465 --> 02:37:12.776]  Well, how exciting is it to have the probably, historically, the number one critic of the Fed being in charge of oversight of the Fed?
[02:37:12.796 --> 02:37:15.019]  That's got to excite people throughout the country.
[02:37:15.719 --> 02:37:17.482]  And I think a lot of good will come of it.
[02:37:18.115 --> 02:37:22.897]  I think the first thing we have to do is try to audit the Fed and have a real meaningful audit of the Fed.
[02:37:23.537 --> 02:37:26.678]  I was amazed at the coalition my dad put together.
[02:37:26.838 --> 02:37:29.639]  Over 330 people in the House signed on to it.
[02:37:29.659 --> 02:37:31.759]  30 some odd people in the Senate.
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:39.282]  And yet, like so many legislative shenanigans, they stole victory from him and they gave us a watered-down audit.
[02:37:39.844 --> 02:37:43.765]  But even the watered-down audit, we're getting some information about what the Fed bought.
[02:37:43.845 --> 02:37:51.027]  But boy, he could really get through, if he could get through a real audit, I will be supporting and introducing that in the Senate as well.
[02:37:51.127 --> 02:37:56.729]  So I think the potential for us shedding some light on what the Fed does is enormous.
[02:37:57.730 --> 02:38:01.631]  A lot of folks obviously want your father to run for president.
[02:38:03.331 --> 02:38:08.593]  Are you thinking about, or are you getting questions, Senator-elect, about running for president yourself?
[02:38:09.645 --> 02:38:14.687]  Well, no, but it's very complimentary to get such a question.
[02:38:15.067 --> 02:38:21.390]  But, you know, I think I haven't even really been sworn into my first office, so it might be premature for me to be thinking about it.
[02:38:21.410 --> 02:38:23.211]  Well, it was the same thing with George Washington.
[02:38:23.251 --> 02:38:25.392]  He went right from general to president.
[02:38:25.452 --> 02:38:31.554]  I mean, we need doctors and farmers and people to be senators and presidents.
[02:38:31.594 --> 02:38:34.376]  We don't need, you know, the lawyers.
[02:38:34.396 --> 02:38:37.317]  I mean, it's so great that you and your father are both doctors
[02:38:37.777 --> 02:38:42.098]  I mean, you're there right now, seeing patients today, in between this interview.
[02:38:42.118 --> 02:38:47.460]  I mean, your victory is our victory, and I just want to commend you.
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:55.282]  Well, I appreciate that, and I know you've got a lot of loyal listeners, and we hear from them, and we meet them across the country and all across Kentucky.
[02:38:55.382 --> 02:38:58.002]  I end up running into your loyal fans.
[02:38:58.562 --> 02:39:04.524]  But the interesting thing is that we're going to do some things that have never been done before, in the sense that
[02:39:05.146 --> 02:39:10.287]  As soon as I get there, I'm going to talk about and introduce a bill that will cut a significant amount of spending.
[02:39:10.807 --> 02:39:16.849]  We have a bill we're working on that will cut $500 billion worth of spending, and that's where we've got to start.
[02:39:16.949 --> 02:39:26.291]  And I think the American people are ready to hear it, because the American people know that we're mortgaging our future to China, that we're printing up the money to pay for these massive debts.
[02:39:26.761 --> 02:39:27.021]  Absolutely!
[02:39:48.229 --> 02:39:49.170]  Senator, sorry to interrupt you.
[02:39:49.190 --> 02:39:52.113]  We've only got about six minutes left with you here today and I've got so many questions.
[02:39:53.074 --> 02:39:54.816]  MSNBC was deceitful.
[02:39:55.156 --> 02:39:56.998]  They lied about what your real views were.
[02:39:57.058 --> 02:39:58.479]  They tried all sorts of dirty tricks.
[02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:01.202]  They said if you don't like Obamacare, you are a racist.
[02:40:01.603 --> 02:40:06.447]  We now learn that hundreds of millions of dollars from your father's even partial audit
[02:40:08.110 --> 02:40:12.057]  of our tax money went to General Electric and MSNBC.
[02:40:12.317 --> 02:40:19.831]  How creepy is that to know that a government media source, like the Kremlin or something, went after you?
[02:40:20.663 --> 02:40:29.929]  Well, the weird thing about it also is that, you know, I tell people that once upon a time our dollar was backed by gold until about 1971, at least partially.
[02:40:30.410 --> 02:40:36.194]  From 71 to about the year 2005, our dollar was backed by at least the U.S.
[02:40:36.254 --> 02:40:37.374]  Treasury Bill's debt.
[02:40:37.394 --> 02:40:40.116]  It wasn't the best thing in the world, but at least it was government debt.
[02:40:40.717 --> 02:40:43.799]  From about 2005 on, though, it's backed by, I guess,
[02:40:44.471 --> 02:40:54.337]  Buying GE, MSNBC, backed by buying used car loans, basically backed by what the government calls toxic assets.
[02:40:54.838 --> 02:41:04.484]  Things that you and I and no person with a rational investment mind would ever buy, we were forced to buy by the Federal Reserve buying it, but that's essentially what backs the U.S.
[02:41:04.544 --> 02:41:05.124]  dollar now.
[02:41:05.204 --> 02:41:10.588]  Toxic assets are now what we pyramid the dollar on, and that is worrisome.
[02:41:11.696 --> 02:41:12.336]  Incredible.
[02:41:12.677 --> 02:41:14.238]  Dealing with the carbon tax.
[02:41:14.258 --> 02:41:19.581]  When you said, I've got a message from the Tea Party to Washington.
[02:41:19.621 --> 02:41:22.083]  We're going to stop you from this carbon tax.
[02:41:22.423 --> 02:41:24.024]  California went ahead with it.
[02:41:24.565 --> 02:41:25.805]  A 20% tax.
[02:41:25.906 --> 02:41:28.127]  They've already got over 30% unemployment.
[02:41:28.147 --> 02:41:29.448]  60 Minutes reports.
[02:41:29.948 --> 02:41:41.436]  What are you going to do as a senator, sir, to try to aggressively block Obama from implementing his agenda by stealth through the EPA and FDA and other groups?
[02:41:42.076 --> 02:42:00.507]  Yeah, that's one of my biggest fears and one of the things that through the election I learned more about our government was that I was amazed and appalled to know how much the unelected bureaucrats are doing and that basically if something fails in the Senate or in the House, they simply do it anyway through these bureaucracies.
[02:42:01.187 --> 02:42:09.712]  And so part of the reform agenda that I think the Tea Party stands for, one of the items that I will push for is sunsetting all regulations.
[02:42:10.327 --> 02:42:17.332]  Basically, if they pass a regulation, it has to be voted on in Congress by a certain period of time, maybe six months, maybe a year.
[02:42:17.793 --> 02:42:20.855]  But it cannot just be put on the books by unelected bureaucrats.
[02:42:21.355 --> 02:42:27.019]  And really, we're in danger of having the government run by these standing bureaucracies.
[02:42:27.059 --> 02:42:29.841]  You know, the Founding Fathers talked about standing armies.
[02:42:30.222 --> 02:42:33.224]  Now what we have is a standing bureaucracy that we need to fear.
[02:42:33.744 --> 02:42:40.749]  And we really need to have governmental reform, and that's a big thing that I'm going to be pushing as part of what I call the Tea Party Platform.
[02:42:41.693 --> 02:42:42.253]  Amazing.
[02:42:42.753 --> 02:42:50.497]  Senator, dealing with the TSA, we had your father, the Honorable Congressman and Medical Doctor from Texas, where I hail from.
[02:42:50.917 --> 02:42:55.099]  We had him on about three weeks ago and it made national news in the Drudge Report and ABC News and other places.
[02:42:55.579 --> 02:42:57.399]  He hadn't really complained about it previously.
[02:42:57.439 --> 02:43:00.621]  He was against the TSA and it's groping and radiating people.
[02:43:01.141 --> 02:43:05.763]  But now the TSA is announcing they're going to continue sticking their hands actually in people's pants.
[02:43:05.803 --> 02:43:08.324]  They only grabbed him on the outside of the pants and
[02:43:08.984 --> 02:43:10.685]  Same thing happened to former Governor Ventura.
[02:43:11.146 --> 02:43:14.648]  Now the Indian ambassador says she'll never come back here again.
[02:43:14.728 --> 02:43:15.749]  That's in the news today.
[02:43:15.769 --> 02:43:17.990]  I mean, who runs things?
[02:43:18.050 --> 02:43:19.511]  The TSA and Homeland Security?
[02:43:19.911 --> 02:43:20.752]  Or the Congress?
[02:43:20.832 --> 02:43:25.034]  Plus, what are the Feds doing seizing control of transportation?
[02:43:25.094 --> 02:43:26.675]  Now they're expanding out to the roads.
[02:43:26.976 --> 02:43:30.898]  They're putting telescreens in Walmart with Napolitano, giving people orders.
[02:43:31.198 --> 02:43:35.081]  What's your take on all this Orwellian stuff, and what's your plan to deal with that?
[02:43:35.819 --> 02:43:42.108]  Well, I think it's amazing that after 10 years we still don't have a frequent flyer plan.
[02:43:42.308 --> 02:43:50.039]  It just shows you the incompetence of the federal government that, you know, my father flies twice a week, my brother-in-law flies three or four times a week.
[02:43:50.760 --> 02:44:06.353]  Why is there not some sort of voluntary program or private program where you could volunteer to have a little more background check, but do it voluntarily, and have a private group that you do it and then you fly through the airport or walk through without obstruction?
[02:44:07.133 --> 02:44:12.618]  There's no reason why this couldn't be done except for the government does not seem to be able to do anything in a logical fashion.
[02:44:13.268 --> 02:44:19.331]  And so instead of saying, well, let's investigate certain people who are flying in from certain countries.
[02:44:19.451 --> 02:44:23.833]  Most of the danger, I think, at risk on the planes is people coming from other countries.
[02:44:24.313 --> 02:44:35.258]  So why don't we look at those folks, you know, look at the flight plan of who's coming to visit us from certain countries and do some investigation in advance of those folks.
[02:44:35.718 --> 02:44:37.959]  But I think we're wasting time on the
[02:44:38.735 --> 02:44:41.376]  Millions and millions of Americans who aren't a threat.
[02:44:41.837 --> 02:44:47.419]  And when you waste so much time on those people, you don't have enough time to spend on the people who truly are a threat.
[02:44:47.579 --> 02:44:49.721]  Well, Senator Rand Paul joining us live.
[02:44:49.761 --> 02:44:50.721]  Only a minute or two left.
[02:44:51.621 --> 02:44:56.284]  They know that the American people aren't the threat, but the MIAC and Homeland Security report
[02:44:57.625 --> 02:45:00.728]  Again, your father said if you have a Ron Paul sticker, that's the enemy.
[02:45:01.028 --> 02:45:01.909]  Returning veterans.
[02:45:01.949 --> 02:45:05.612]  It was in the news yesterday that TSA is harassing our returning troops.
[02:45:05.952 --> 02:45:18.824]  I mean, you're being diplomatic and I respect that, but in your gut, do you agree that this is just a federal power grab and they want to train us, normal citizens, to basically submit like we're criminals in a prison?
[02:45:19.667 --> 02:45:39.084]  Well, I think the danger anytime you give a government agency so much power is that exactly what Rahm Emanuel said about government, you know, let no crisis go wasted, let no crisis deter us or, you know, let's use those crises to go ahead and foment and use government to grow larger and larger.
[02:45:39.104 --> 02:45:40.385]  So, yeah, there is a danger.
[02:45:41.385 --> 02:45:50.768]  And what they do is they suck in some well-meaning people, and they want the power to say that it's going after terrorism, which none of us want terrorists to be allowed to attack our country.
[02:45:51.128 --> 02:45:57.750]  But in the process, we all get swooped up in it, and all of our liberties get infringed upon, and that's the real danger in these things.
[02:45:58.170 --> 02:46:05.712]  But it always works upon trying to show you something that is rational, something that people don't want to have happen.
[02:46:05.812 --> 02:46:07.453]  Nobody wants another terrorist attack.
[02:46:07.813 --> 02:46:08.753]  But in doing so,
[02:46:09.355 --> 02:46:15.197]  Then everybody gets lumped in together and our freedoms get eroded and taken away.
[02:46:15.637 --> 02:46:16.697]  Last question, sir.
[02:46:17.718 --> 02:46:28.741]  Obviously, there are a lot of Republicans, like Boehner, who was in Bloomberg, was going to try to block your father getting the committee chairmanship that he was already supposed to get in seniority.
[02:46:29.741 --> 02:46:36.463]  uh... and and and blocking so many others he's a protégé of Newt Gingrich who supports global warming taxes and uh... globalism.
[02:46:36.503 --> 02:46:58.229]  I'm not trying to get a fight going between republicans uh... we we've seen former senator Trent Lott brag in the news that hey we're gonna co-opt all these new senators uh... and uh... house members i would hope that if you do see the co-opting that that not only we know you won't sell out we know that honorable family you're an honorable person values are what matter but hopefully you'll blow the whistle
[02:46:58.989 --> 02:47:05.574]  And truly lead and let us know about who the good guys are and who the bad guys are.
[02:47:05.594 --> 02:47:08.035]  We know Senator DeMint's good and a few others.
[02:47:08.376 --> 02:47:10.277]  What's your basic statement on that?
[02:47:10.297 --> 02:47:12.879]  Are they already trying to pull you into the smoky rooms?
[02:47:13.780 --> 02:47:18.625]  Well, I think what's interesting is that we've already had an impact, and we haven't even gotten up there.
[02:47:18.705 --> 02:47:24.290]  And I think they have heard the message, and you've heard some of them saying, you know what, we heard the message of the election.
[02:47:24.731 --> 02:47:32.318]  But the real devil is in the details, and, you know, of what these negotiations are, what happens behind closed doors.
[02:47:32.738 --> 02:47:37.383]  And I will do my utmost to shine light on that, but also to stand up in the Senate
[02:47:38.001 --> 02:47:40.204]  And say, this isn't what we're going to do.
[02:47:40.424 --> 02:47:44.789]  We have to do something about the debt and we can't just keep spending money.
[02:47:45.290 --> 02:47:55.022]  So yeah, I think you'll find that I will be a voice that will look for opportunities at every turn to try to slow down their agenda and also to correct things.
[02:47:56.058 --> 02:48:02.521]  And I think that that's not really been done in the past because so many of the people who get elected have been in office forever and ever.
[02:48:02.561 --> 02:48:16.527]  I've never been in office before, so I think it gives me a perspective where I haven't been beaten down by the system, and I go there really, truly with the belief that I can and want to be part of a movement that changes our country for the better.
[02:48:16.707 --> 02:48:17.087]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:17.167 --> 02:48:20.269]  In closing, and I know you've got to get back to patience, one caveat here.
[02:48:20.929 --> 02:48:24.692]  I know that we do need to cut spending.
[02:48:24.732 --> 02:48:27.013]  You've called for cutting defense.
[02:48:27.893 --> 02:48:29.414]  I believe you said by $100 billion.
[02:48:29.434 --> 02:48:30.675]  That's large.
[02:48:30.715 --> 02:48:31.515]  That's substantive.
[02:48:32.336 --> 02:48:35.518]  But also, don't we need to say no more bailouts?
[02:48:36.158 --> 02:48:45.468]  If somebody like Paulson comes down there again, like happened in October two years ago, and says, we're going to have martial law, we're going to have collapse if you don't do this.
[02:48:45.488 --> 02:48:50.914]  I mean, what do we do at that point when they try to hold our financial system hostage again?
[02:48:50.934 --> 02:48:53.017]  I mean, what are you planning to do at that point?
[02:48:53.817 --> 02:49:02.459]  Well, I think you need to have people who are brave enough and competent enough in their belief in freedom to stand up and say, we can survive a bankruptcy.
[02:49:03.019 --> 02:49:11.001]  And also to point out that AIG's bankruptcy, or lack of bankruptcy in their bailout, basically wasn't bailing out just AIG.
[02:49:11.101 --> 02:49:17.963]  It was bailing out a lot of Wall Street bankers who had money in AIG, but also was bailing out a lot of foreign banks.
[02:49:18.523 --> 02:49:22.744]  So really, a lot of this is just pointing out the truth and letting people know that
[02:49:23.331 --> 02:49:41.382]  And I think people are very upset when they find out that, you know, very, very wealthy inside bankers in New York, as well as across the country and across the world, benefited from average middle-class taxpayers like the rest of us having to send money to Washington to bail out AIG.
[02:49:41.402 --> 02:49:46.205]  What they do is they all gang up and say, oh, it'd be the end of the world if you don't do this.
[02:49:46.809 --> 02:49:56.413]  But my dad's always made a good point that all the people who said it would be the end of the world and that there'd be a collapse of the economy were all the same people who didn't predict any of this coming.
[02:49:56.793 --> 02:50:01.815]  So we don't have to accept their word at face value that we have to take their predictions as they were.
[02:50:02.628 --> 02:50:08.413]  Well, thank you, Senator-elect, and we look forward to talking to you when you are in office.
[02:50:08.953 --> 02:50:10.995]  This is a great victory for all lovers of liberty.
[02:50:11.015 --> 02:50:15.078]  They threw everything they could at you and collectively all of us, and they failed.
[02:50:15.198 --> 02:50:22.424]  This could be history if we get Ron Paul in as president, as John Adams, and then down the road like John Quincy Adams, Rand Paul.
[02:50:23.004 --> 02:50:23.805]  Sir, God bless you.
[02:50:23.825 --> 02:50:24.866]  Have a great holiday.
[02:50:24.906 --> 02:50:28.269]  Say hi to your wife and sons, and say hi to your father and mother.
[02:50:28.769 --> 02:50:29.870]  Just God bless you, Senator.
[02:50:29.890 --> 02:50:30.951]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:50:31.630 --> 02:50:34.130]  Amazing, there he goes, Senator Rand Paul.
[02:50:35.471 --> 02:50:39.892]  And they pulled their hair out, they did everything they could to stop us, and they failed.
[02:50:41.812 --> 02:50:44.172]  And it's like a victory of Washington at Trenton.
[02:50:45.032 --> 02:50:46.373]  We're going to have more victories.
[02:50:47.153 --> 02:50:49.173]  And hey, some of us aren't going to make it out of this.
[02:50:49.873 --> 02:50:54.934]  But in the end, my great-great-great-great-grandchildren are going to be just like Buck Rogers.
[02:50:55.634 --> 02:50:58.275]  We're going to the stars, and they're not going to stop us.
[02:51:00.771 --> 02:51:04.052]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:04.852 --> 02:51:09.093]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:09.353 --> 02:51:15.294]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:15.514 --> 02:51:17.655]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:17.935 --> 02:51:23.916]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.036 --> 02:51:27.380]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:27.440 --> 02:51:29.143]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:29.323 --> 02:51:31.366]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:31.506 --> 02:51:36.172]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:36.392 --> 02:51:37.013]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:37.193 --> 02:51:41.259]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.

[02:51:50.244 --> 02:51:51.085]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.
[02:52:00.219 --> 02:52:05.083]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:05.183 --> 02:52:05.963]  What have we got?
[02:52:06.183 --> 02:52:08.305]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:08.625 --> 02:52:09.366]  A republic.
[02:52:09.626 --> 02:52:12.208]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:12.288 --> 02:52:14.189]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:14.550 --> 02:52:16.451]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:16.571 --> 02:52:17.852]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:18.252 --> 02:52:19.373]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:19.573 --> 02:52:19.974]  Children?
[02:52:20.174 --> 02:52:20.954]  Our education?
[02:52:21.295 --> 02:52:21.935]  Our money?
[02:52:22.115 --> 02:52:25.778]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:26.138 --> 02:52:29.804]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:29.844 --> 02:52:30.785]  You're being warned.
[02:52:31.106 --> 02:52:31.947]  We have the facts.
[02:52:32.128 --> 02:52:33.249]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:33.289 --> 02:52:34.191]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:34.211 --> 02:52:35.052]  We have common law.
[02:52:35.092 --> 02:52:37.356]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:37.616 --> 02:52:41.402]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:41.482 --> 02:52:46.284]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:46.444 --> 02:52:47.804]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:47.944 --> 02:52:48.785]  Don't tread on me.

[02:53:15.334 --> 02:53:18.796]  These are bad conditions for the very young, older, and the chemically sensitive.

[02:54:05.998 --> 02:54:08.000]  All the lovers of liberty.
[02:54:08.040 --> 02:54:11.983]  None of us are going to make it out of this alive.
[02:54:12.003 --> 02:54:16.386]  But if we stand up for what's right, we will live forever.
[02:54:17.306 --> 02:54:19.748]  That's all that matters.
[02:54:20.309 --> 02:54:21.870]  We will live on through our progeny.
[02:54:22.510 --> 02:54:28.815]  And our examples that we give to them will help them be greater than we ever were.
[02:54:29.175 --> 02:54:32.156]  The masters hung me in the spring of twenty-five.
[02:54:32.236 --> 02:54:34.117]  But I am still alive.
[02:54:34.618 --> 02:54:36.378]  But I am still alive.
[02:54:36.398 --> 02:54:36.799]  Ha ha!
[02:54:37.139 --> 02:54:41.541]  Land of the free, home of the brave is awakening!
[02:54:41.561 --> 02:54:46.403]  The social engineers that masquerade as liberals are Nazi fascist criminals.
[02:54:46.863 --> 02:54:48.704]  And they will be defeated!
[02:54:48.884 --> 02:54:54.507]  And their neoconservants and the fake right-wing rhino whores will be defeated!
[02:54:57.802 --> 02:54:58.582]  I went aloft.
[02:54:58.903 --> 02:55:02.964]  I went aloft and whirled and made so little blow.
[02:55:03.004 --> 02:55:03.945]  When it broke off.
[02:55:04.765 --> 02:55:08.447]  And when the yards broke off, they said that I got killed.
[02:55:08.607 --> 02:55:10.168]  But I'm livin' still.
[02:55:10.268 --> 02:55:11.588]  But I'm livin' still.
[02:55:11.648 --> 02:55:13.109]  Ron Paul on ending the Fed.
[02:55:13.149 --> 02:55:16.691]  The power of ideas will prevail.
[02:55:16.871 --> 02:55:18.031]  I was a dam building.
[02:55:19.192 --> 02:55:21.493]  Across a river deep and wide.
[02:55:23.554 --> 02:55:26.115]  Where steel and water did collide.
[02:55:26.980 --> 02:55:27.880]  A place called Boulder.
[02:55:27.940 --> 02:55:29.300]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:55:29.320 --> 02:55:31.081]  I gotta get to some final news here.
[02:55:31.141 --> 02:55:32.021]  Thank you guys.
[02:55:32.041 --> 02:55:33.961]  They buried me in that grey tomb that knows no sound.
[02:55:34.001 --> 02:55:34.941]  But I'm still around.
[02:55:34.981 --> 02:55:36.482]  Won't be time for Johnny Cash today.
[02:55:36.502 --> 02:55:36.902]  Ron Paul.
[02:55:36.942 --> 02:55:37.362]  Ron Paul.
[02:55:56.189 --> 02:55:58.512]  This is a key article up at GCNLive.com.
[02:55:59.273 --> 02:56:00.694]  It's also up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:56:00.714 --> 02:56:01.776]  Get out to everybody you know.
[02:56:03.624 --> 02:56:08.686]  Ron Paul on ending the Fed, the power of ideas will prevail.
[02:56:09.127 --> 02:56:13.829]  Congressman, we should think about changing the Fed and getting rid of the Fed.
[02:56:14.269 --> 02:56:17.471]  So now, and he's agreed on this show, he is now in danger.
[02:56:17.491 --> 02:56:19.792]  And I've talked to him behind the scenes, folks.
[02:56:20.472 --> 02:56:25.774]  Ron Paul is now entering the area that Abraham Lincoln did when he tried to throw out the bankers.
[02:56:26.195 --> 02:56:28.316]  He's now entering the area that JFK entered.
[02:56:28.836 --> 02:56:30.857]  But the idea is bulletproof.
[02:56:32.264 --> 02:56:34.845]  But Ron Paul, they're going to come after him now.
[02:56:35.246 --> 02:56:43.690]  He is going to be the chairman of the committee that has the rightful congressional power to subpoena and go after this fourth branch of private corporate government.
[02:56:45.031 --> 02:56:47.993]  Key article, Ron Paul, on ending the Fed.
[02:56:49.233 --> 02:56:51.995]  The power of ideas will prevail.
[02:56:53.450 --> 02:56:55.672]  In fact, let's make this the number one Google search term today.
[02:56:55.692 --> 02:56:56.752]  I haven't done one all week.
[02:56:57.413 --> 02:56:59.214]  Let's make it Power of Ideas.
[02:56:59.254 --> 02:57:00.575]  I don't know if we can do it right at the end of the show.
[02:57:00.615 --> 02:57:01.376]  It'll take a few hours.
[02:57:01.636 --> 02:57:03.517]  But if all of you search right now, we can do it.
[02:57:03.858 --> 02:57:05.199]  Power of Ideas.
[02:57:05.639 --> 02:57:06.960]  Power of Ideas.
[02:57:07.460 --> 02:57:11.383]  And Google blocks us, but you can take our article, post it, and then you'll get the traffic.
[02:57:11.743 --> 02:57:12.244]  I don't care.
[02:57:12.924 --> 02:57:14.065]  Power of ideas.
[02:57:14.125 --> 02:57:14.725]  Three words.
[02:57:14.845 --> 02:57:15.405]  Let's do it.
[02:57:15.626 --> 02:57:16.946]  Let's end the Fed together.
[02:57:16.986 --> 02:57:18.547]  We're sending Rand Paul to the Senate.
[02:57:18.827 --> 02:57:20.548]  We're sending Ron Paul to the House.
[02:57:21.029 --> 02:57:25.952]  And they're leading the charge against the globalists that have been perched on top of us, shucking us dry.
[02:57:26.272 --> 02:57:27.693]  Power of ideas.
[02:57:28.053 --> 02:57:31.315]  I want to make that the number one Google search term today.
[02:57:31.735 --> 02:57:33.156]  Let's do it together.
[02:57:33.176 --> 02:57:36.218]  Normally I have to do it the first to show for it to be successful, but you can do it.
[02:57:36.718 --> 02:57:38.359]  Put it in the Google search engine over and over again.
[02:57:38.639 --> 02:57:39.880]  Power of ideas.
[02:57:40.620 --> 02:57:44.724]  Continuing establishment Republicans introduced bill to criminalize WikiLeaks.
[02:57:45.165 --> 02:57:46.766]  And that means anybody else's free speech.
[02:57:47.467 --> 02:57:51.290]  Ron Paul claims chairmanship of monetary policy subcommittee.
[02:57:51.350 --> 02:57:52.732]  Prepared to subpoena Fed.
[02:57:53.092 --> 02:57:53.433]  Boom!
