[00:00:04.551 --> 00:00:05.191]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:06.912]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:08.772]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:10.213]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.993 --> 00:00:11.873]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:16.135]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:20.777]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.612 --> 00:00:30.479]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the waypoint into this syndicated transmission.
[00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:34.184]  Going out on the AM and FM dial, gaining three or four new affiliates a week.

[00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:46.835]  It's another great way to get the truth out there.

[00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:09.384]  Not just a simple
[00:01:09.964 --> 00:01:32.854]  uh... video cam but a full four camera shoot with the document cam exclusive videos we play and a lot more at prison planet dot tv okay uh... i'm gonna try to get through a bunch of these calls and then go back into all the news that we have here today and it's very important but so are your calls scott in california says that he disagrees so scott you go to the head of the line go ahead
[00:01:34.454 --> 00:01:34.794]  Hey, man.
[00:01:36.235 --> 00:01:41.940]  I called because I wanted to give you grief, actually, about what I consider you to be dropping the ball.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:02:00.574]  And that is, you know, we've been hearing hours and hours of broadcast about image protection with this MSNBC special, but with all of the InfoWars infrastructure and you being in close proximity, you have not covered what is unfolding to be one of the biggest stories of our lifetime in the Gulf.
[00:02:01.263 --> 00:02:08.527]  And you could be down there doing so much justice, and here we are just hearing total image, you know, protection.
[00:02:08.648 --> 00:02:11.429]  And it's getting, you know, I'm wondering, what are you doing?
[00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.111]  Why are you diverting from this enormous story?
[00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:19.614]  Well, Scott, I mean, we've had a lot of guests on, we've had people from Louisiana on.
[00:02:20.535 --> 00:02:28.882]  I've gotten hundreds of emails saying, why aren't I reporting that 40 million people are being evacuated and there's gun confiscation going on, because it's not true.
[00:02:28.902 --> 00:02:31.404]  I mean, is that what you're talking about?
[00:02:31.624 --> 00:02:37.729]  Well, what I'm talking about is, Alex, with your infrastructure... Hold on a minute, put him on hold.
[00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.091]  My infrastructure...
[00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:43.862]  I mean, I'm here just trying to keep the websites up under the traffic they're getting.
[00:02:44.142 --> 00:02:45.244]  I'm here trying to pay the bills.
[00:02:45.304 --> 00:02:46.304]  I'm not that big.
[00:02:47.305 --> 00:02:54.892]  I've got about 20 employees and contractors, and I spend most of my time trying to raise the money just to run the infrastructure.
[00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:57.475]  You say one of the biggest stories ever.
[00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:01.628]  I mean we know that they're telling the media don't be on the beach.
[00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:11.259]  I just sent two guys for four or five days to Chicago where they're having the army work with local police in door-to-door drills.
[00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.220]  That was in the...
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.261]  I don't think so.
[00:03:33.592 --> 00:03:34.112]  Well, you know what?
[00:03:34.152 --> 00:03:46.041]  I'd love to go to the Gulf and be down there by the beach and be able to have the wanderlust satisfied and look at a bunch of oil and some dead dolphins and have some guys run up and say, get off the beach and, you know, upload it to YouTube and get a million views.
[00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:49.349]  I think it's a diversion.
[00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.310]  It's a horrible thing that's happening, Scott.
[00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.591]  I'm going to go back to you, so don't hang up.
[00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.172]  I think it's a horrible thing that's happening down there.
[00:03:55.552 --> 00:03:57.073]  But compared to the U.N.
[00:03:57.093 --> 00:04:06.598]  about to vote, the Congress about to vote, for an embargo and to board Iranian ships that leave their country, saying they're not allowed to have any trade, that's an act of war.
[00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.900]  And Israel's saying they're getting ready for World War III and to launch nukes.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.401]  You know, that's in the Times of London Associated Press.
[00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:21.201]  Nuclear war is a lot bigger than 50 million barrels, or whatever it is, or 50 million gallons, excuse me, not 50 million barrels.
[00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:22.782]  Well, that'd be worse.
[00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:25.724]  50 million gallons of oil in the Gulf.
[00:04:26.845 --> 00:04:30.148]  So, number one, I mean, I don't like to be praised.
[00:04:30.168 --> 00:04:31.889]  And we're going to go to break, come back to you, Scott.
[00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.476]  I don't like when people call and tell me what a great job I'm doing, because I'm doing my duty, and I am actually self-critical, and I'm always trying to do a better job.
[00:04:41.755 --> 00:04:45.918]  But conversely, I don't like being criticized about what I need to do.
[00:04:45.938 --> 00:04:50.581]  You know, I cover the oil spill probably an hour or more a day, total.
[00:04:50.942 --> 00:04:51.642]  Today, even more.
[00:04:51.662 --> 00:04:56.786]  We got a full hour just of Pastor Lindsey Williams talking about it.
[00:04:56.806 --> 00:04:57.746]  We're taking your phone calls.
[00:04:58.227 --> 00:04:58.947]  And then I'm bad?
[00:04:58.967 --> 00:05:03.270]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:09.515]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:05:09.895 --> 00:05:16.999]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:21.862]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:05:30.827 --> 00:05:34.549]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:41.253]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:45.256]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:05:45.736 --> 00:05:51.600]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.

[00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.150]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.214]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:10.637]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:10.657 --> 00:06:16.123]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:17.705]  This film conclusively
[00:06:18.206 --> 00:06:28.740]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:32.866]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:06:33.346 --> 00:06:37.327]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:37.627 --> 00:06:43.549]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:46.530]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:47.131 --> 00:06:48.531]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:49.111 --> 00:06:49.571]  It's here.

[00:07:48.727 --> 00:07:49.268]  fallofamerica.net
[00:08:01.522 --> 00:08:07.546]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.147 --> 00:08:11.189]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.311 --> 00:08:22.697]  Okay, if you just joined us, Scott in California called in and said, you're not covering the oil spill, the biggest story ever.
[00:08:24.215 --> 00:08:26.596]  Which I resent, that's not true, we've been covering it.
[00:08:27.777 --> 00:08:29.678]  And all you're doing is image control.
[00:08:30.739 --> 00:08:35.362]  No, I mean we probably spent 30 minutes yesterday on the Chris Matthews thing, probably 5 minutes today.
[00:08:36.918 --> 00:08:39.761]  Uh, mentioning that people are calling for a boycott of MSNBC.
[00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:57.137]  MSNBC coming out and saying that if you call government takeover of healthcare bad, you're a racist, and implying that anybody who's against world government is going to carry out terror attacks, that is the whole homeland security setup to frame the American people.
[00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:14.063]  Ahead of stage terror attacks, but it really sounds like a red herring to me, Scott, that you're calling in telling me that I'm not covering the oil spill when I've covered it a lot more than been really anything else lately, and I think overall
[00:09:15.124 --> 00:09:18.066]  The situation with Iran is much more important.
[00:09:18.606 --> 00:09:33.516]  Scott, did you hear me earlier read that the Iranians, we have an Infowars.com article Curt Nemo wrote, linking to the Iranian government's announcements on press TV, that if the UN goes ahead with its fourth round of sanctions, which includes a blockade,
[00:09:34.656 --> 00:09:40.618]  Of Iranian ships coming and going, that that's an act of war, that they're going to start boarding other people's vessels.
[00:09:42.018 --> 00:09:44.219]  I mean, really, I think that's the biggest issue.
[00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:55.502]  Secondarily, I think the world economic implosion going on with the central banks looting us and then foisting this unpayable debt on our backs is big.
[00:09:56.742 --> 00:09:59.983]  I happen to know there have been bigger oil spills in the Middle East.
[00:10:00.803 --> 00:10:10.085]  In their gulfs, and bigger oil spills in Indonesia, and one as big a few years ago in the gulf in Mexico, the media is hyping this.
[00:10:10.946 --> 00:10:12.626]  I do think it's a false flag.
[00:10:12.906 --> 00:10:28.270]  I think all the evidence, I've gone over it here, but to mention it, I better repeat it, you've got BP CEO dumping 33 or more percent of their stock, you've got Goldman Sachs being the co-chair of BP when this happened, you've got them dumping 44 percent, and then
[00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:37.481]  More in a second sale the day of but in the month before and up to two days before dumping 44% a record amount just on that oil company.
[00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:43.288]  You have BP being a top globalist company that's invested tens of billions of dollars in global carbon taxes.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:51.365]  You have Obama blocking the local communities from protecting their estuaries in the two weeks they had to get the systems up.
[00:10:51.705 --> 00:10:57.609]  Blocking the Dutch and the Norwegians and others with their big mega-skimmers that they had in the area that could have really mitigated things.
[00:10:58.029 --> 00:11:00.251]  Stopping an immediate burn-off at the site.
[00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:01.371]  They're now igniting a flare.
[00:11:01.611 --> 00:11:03.092]  They think it'll burn about 10% of it.
[00:11:03.293 --> 00:11:04.653]  They've got another mitigation.
[00:11:04.673 --> 00:11:05.914]  They think it's about 30% of it.
[00:11:06.134 --> 00:11:07.095]  So that cuts it by 40%.
[00:11:07.976 --> 00:11:10.457]  They should have immediately torched it and lit the thing on fire.
[00:11:10.758 --> 00:11:14.140]  Then you would have just had the carbon dioxide off-gassing.
[00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:22.387]  But, and I'm not an oil expert, I just go to what the experts have always done and did immediate research on those subjects.
[00:11:23.188 --> 00:11:24.489]  So what else am I supposed to do?
[00:11:24.529 --> 00:11:30.394]  I mean, coming up in T-minus 49 minutes, we got Lindsey Williams on, you know, going over this more.
[00:11:32.196 --> 00:11:36.259]  I just think with everything going on in the world, you know, I'm not the bad guy here, Scott.
[00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:37.420]  I mean, what do I do?
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:56.493]  Send two guys to the coast or not do my radio show and walk away from something that reaches millions of people and go to the coast and show a dead dolphin and have some BP guys walk up and say, get out of here, get off my coastline and go file a complaint that my rights are being violated.
[00:11:57.944 --> 00:12:05.572]  Scott, tell me how to do it, because I do need advice, but I don't think I should be criticized because I can't do everything.
[00:12:05.632 --> 00:12:11.098]  Sir, tonight my son calls me every day at about 4 or 5 and says, Daddy, are you coming home?
[00:12:11.959 --> 00:12:13.320]  And I tell him, no.
[00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:17.842]  And last night, Daddy didn't come home until about 10.
[00:12:18.102 --> 00:12:20.362]  And tonight, Daddy isn't coming home until maybe midnight.
[00:12:20.402 --> 00:12:21.222]  I'm working on a film.
[00:12:21.743 --> 00:12:38.026]  I mean, I don't know how I run websites, make business decisions on what to fund, what not to fund, deal with employee issues, deal with my own household, my children, deal with making films, doing a radio show four hours a day, turn down all these magazine, newspaper, and radio interviews.
[00:12:39.186 --> 00:12:43.127]  I mean, explain to me, Scott, how I can do more for you.
[00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:48.386]  Well, actually, it's not more for me, and less dialogue.
[00:12:49.487 --> 00:12:55.831]  You'll get information that it doesn't even pan out, that you'll run up to Hardin, Montana in 24-hour notice.
[00:12:56.412 --> 00:13:02.055]  You'll report that FEMA's using outhouses to beat people because somebody told you.
[00:13:02.556 --> 00:13:03.416]  But this is a huge story.
[00:13:03.456 --> 00:13:03.997]  Hold on a minute.
[00:13:04.397 --> 00:13:06.898]  I never said FEMA's using outhouses to beat people.
[00:13:07.699 --> 00:13:09.260]  Making a little joke like you would.
[00:13:09.961 --> 00:13:13.663]  But my point is, just like the whole post office thing, that's what I'm talking about.
[00:13:14.244 --> 00:13:15.505]  Anyhow, the point is this.
[00:13:16.525 --> 00:13:17.325]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:13:17.345 --> 00:13:20.927]  The Post Office is expanding these little secret prisons.
[00:13:21.387 --> 00:13:31.971]  I know it has dual use for postal inspector investigations with employees and to surveil the people down on the shipping floor.
[00:13:33.832 --> 00:13:40.758]  There is a program to use the post offices as emergency forced inoculation centers.
[00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:44.020]  That's part of the Model Health Emergency Powers Act.
[00:13:45.422 --> 00:13:47.763]  Let me go over each thing you're saying here, because this isn't true.
[00:13:48.752 --> 00:14:01.895]  There is a program to use these post offices and with the Hardin, Montana situation, the same companies now in Texas, we had an article about this two weeks ago, trying to get other municipalities to build more private prisons.
[00:14:02.275 --> 00:14:04.796]  That guy was a felon up there running that.
[00:14:05.336 --> 00:14:08.837]  There were blueprints that said alien detention center.
[00:14:09.097 --> 00:14:10.257]  They did want to use it.
[00:14:10.797 --> 00:14:13.959]  That was on CNN to hold people from Camp X-Ray.
[00:14:14.299 --> 00:14:21.404]  They did have police on the side of their vehicles, and so I went and checked into that because we didn't know!
[00:14:21.424 --> 00:14:25.547]  And I wanted to be there to see exactly what was happening.
[00:14:25.807 --> 00:14:27.509]  We know what's going on in the Gulf.
[00:14:27.849 --> 00:14:33.493]  We've had reporters on that we trust, radio talk show hosts, and others that live down there.
[00:14:33.813 --> 00:14:36.114]  We know what's going on in the Gulf.
[00:14:36.635 --> 00:14:37.055]  Okay?
[00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:38.756]  So, I mean,
[00:14:40.302 --> 00:14:41.303]  That doesn't make sense.
[00:14:43.126 --> 00:14:43.687]  Am I on?
[00:14:43.947 --> 00:14:44.828]  Yeah, you're on, Scott.
[00:14:44.868 --> 00:14:45.830]  Okay, excellent.
[00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:51.578]  Alex, seriously, this is everybody from the esoteric to the scientific.
[00:14:52.105 --> 00:14:54.586]  are talking about the global implications of this.
[00:14:55.106 --> 00:14:59.486]  You do have the ability to go down there... Yeah, the media is hyping the living... Put him on hold again.
[00:14:59.947 --> 00:15:06.088]  I'm not going to get up here, people with two weeks been telling me, say they're evacuating 40 million people, say there's martial law.
[00:15:06.748 --> 00:15:09.068]  The whole country's under a form of martial law.
[00:15:09.548 --> 00:15:10.969]  I'm just not going to report that.
[00:15:11.669 --> 00:15:12.029]  Okay?
[00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:14.229]  And you say the esoteric.
[00:15:14.349 --> 00:15:14.689]  Okay.
[00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:16.570]  Let me read... I mean, let's do what you want here.
[00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:17.310]  Wormwood.
[00:15:18.922 --> 00:15:23.766]  Is the Greek is a star or angel that appears in the biblical New Testament book of Revelation.
[00:15:24.547 --> 00:15:26.388]  And Wormwood falls into the ocean.
[00:15:26.828 --> 00:15:31.512]  And it's mentioned in Deuteronomy, Jeremiah, and a bunch of other places.
[00:15:31.852 --> 00:15:34.094]  Interpretations of Revelation 8-10, here.
[00:15:34.554 --> 00:15:40.919]  And of course, no one in six months will say that, okay, you were right, it wasn't the end of the world.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.343]  And it didn't kill a third of the entire ocean on the world.
[00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.132]  Okay, no one, it'll just be Alex is bad, he's covering up Wormwood.
[00:15:50.392 --> 00:16:02.499]  So here, okay, it's the end of the world, and Wormwood, a star fell, and hit the oil platform, and it's just, and let's have some Nostradamus, some vague Nostradamus here for you.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.522]  Let's go ahead and read over this for people.
[00:16:07.582 --> 00:16:08.923]  Here, let's get into this for people.
[00:16:11.864 --> 00:16:14.386]  Futurist interpretations, and then it gets into
[00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:18.001]  The oil spill and Wormwood.
[00:16:19.122 --> 00:16:21.003]  This from the Christian-Forum.net.
[00:16:21.624 --> 00:16:26.088]  It says, in the last days, or should we look, worse things to happen.
[00:16:26.128 --> 00:16:32.673]  Revelation 8, 5, the angel took the canister and filled it with fire of the altar and casted it into the earth.
[00:16:32.993 --> 00:16:35.796]  And there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake.
[00:16:36.316 --> 00:16:40.079]  Six and seven angels, which had these seven trumpets, prepared themselves to sound.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.023]  And people say, look, there were earthquakes in Haiti and Chile.
[00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:48.281]  So, there's always earthquakes.
[00:16:50.643 --> 00:16:52.564]  I mean, I just go off what I can prove here, okay?
[00:16:53.265 --> 00:16:58.168]  The first angel sounded and there were... followed a hail and fire mingled with blood.
[00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:01.110]  So hail and fire is falling.
[00:17:01.531 --> 00:17:02.051]  And blood.
[00:17:02.111 --> 00:17:03.232]  Sounds like nuclear war to me.
[00:17:03.252 --> 00:17:04.292]  Doesn't sound like an oil rig.
[00:17:05.113 --> 00:17:08.315]  The first angel... Now, if they attack Iran, this may end up happening.
[00:17:09.316 --> 00:17:10.577]  But I'm not supposed to talk about that.
[00:17:10.597 --> 00:17:12.979]  I'm supposed to... The esoteric says, Alex,
[00:17:14.025 --> 00:17:22.858]  The first angel sounded, and there were hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth, and the third part of trees was burnt up.
[00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:25.201]  A third part of the earth's trees were burnt up?
[00:17:26.483 --> 00:17:27.164]  Has that happened?
[00:17:28.045 --> 00:17:29.547]  And all green grass was burnt up.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:36.546]  And the second angel sounded, and it was with a great mountain burning, and fire was cast into the sea.
[00:17:36.586 --> 00:17:37.847]  So they say, oh, look at Iceland.
[00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:39.308]  That just happened.
[00:17:39.568 --> 00:17:41.370]  And the third part of the sea became blood.
[00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:46.755]  And the third part of the creatures that were in the sea and had life died, and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
[00:17:47.736 --> 00:17:50.098]  A third of the animals aren't dead, a third of the ships aren't destroyed.
[00:17:50.719 --> 00:17:56.184]  Verse 10, And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp.
[00:17:57.085 --> 00:17:57.946]  An asteroid, folks.
[00:17:58.306 --> 00:18:02.510]  And it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters, in 11.
[00:18:03.191 --> 00:18:05.112]  And the name of the star is called Wormwood.
[00:18:05.393 --> 00:18:08.015]  And the third part of the waters came Wormwood.
[00:18:08.275 --> 00:18:10.898]  And many men died of the waters, because they were bitter.
[00:18:11.498 --> 00:18:12.779]  And the fourth angel sounded.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.942]  Now, what kind of star can fall?
[00:18:15.962 --> 00:18:17.063]  A hydrogen bomb?
[00:18:17.544 --> 00:18:19.045]  Nuclear radiation fallout?
[00:18:19.746 --> 00:18:20.707]  Contaminating the water?
[00:18:22.895 --> 00:18:28.897]  And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars.
[00:18:29.177 --> 00:18:34.179]  So the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for part of it, and the night likewise.
[00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:34.760]  Thirteen.
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:48.505]  And I beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, like you're in deep trouble, buddy, to the inhabitants of the earth, by reason of other voices of the trumpet and the three angels, which are yet to sound.
[00:18:51.098 --> 00:18:55.502]  I mean, this is not the end of the world with this oil leaking, okay?
[00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.424]  What is it you don't understand?
[00:18:57.724 --> 00:19:01.367]  There have been bigger oil leaks in the ocean before.
[00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:06.471]  It is not good, but they are not evacuating 40 million people.
[00:19:07.172 --> 00:19:08.193]  That is not happening.
[00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:09.949]  Okay?
[00:19:10.409 --> 00:19:11.730]  That is not going on.
[00:19:11.991 --> 00:19:13.112]  That is not happening.
[00:19:13.352 --> 00:19:14.793]  We're not covering that up.
[00:19:15.214 --> 00:19:16.735]  Wormwood has not fallen.
[00:19:17.276 --> 00:19:20.819]  A third of the Earth's men are not dying right now of poison.
[00:19:22.081 --> 00:19:24.903]  A third of the trees and all the grass is not burned up.
[00:19:25.604 --> 00:19:27.166]  A third of the ships are not destroyed.
[00:19:27.446 --> 00:19:30.149]  A third of the life in the ocean is not dead.
[00:19:32.981 --> 00:19:36.163]  The media is hyping this as a diversion.
[00:19:36.204 --> 00:19:39.046]  Just like every 9-11, that's all that was on the news for four or five months.
[00:19:39.066 --> 00:19:40.247]  That's all anybody would talk about.
[00:19:40.807 --> 00:19:42.889]  While they were busy taking over.
[00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.810]  Stay there, Scott.
[00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:45.771]  I'm gonna have you continue here.
[00:19:45.791 --> 00:19:47.172]  And I'm not gonna spend much more time with you, though.
[00:19:47.873 --> 00:19:48.153]  Okay?
[00:19:48.173 --> 00:19:50.995]  You mean you're on the air, and all you're doing is complaining about me?
[00:19:51.335 --> 00:19:52.936]  Tell us the big revelation!
[00:19:53.237 --> 00:19:57.240]  Tell us about what it is we must know about the stupid BP oil leak!
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.184]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:20:04.505 --> 00:20:08.589]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:20:08.849 --> 00:20:14.195]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:20:14.594 --> 00:20:15.034]  It's true.
[00:20:15.334 --> 00:20:20.755]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:20:21.036 --> 00:20:24.316]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:20:24.616 --> 00:20:29.097]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:20:29.337 --> 00:20:31.698]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:20:32.098 --> 00:20:35.479]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:40.440]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:45.463]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:20:45.763 --> 00:20:49.785]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:20:49.925 --> 00:20:51.486]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:20:51.707 --> 00:20:53.788]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:20:53.968 --> 00:20:56.309]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:00.460]  Good day.
[00:21:00.661 --> 00:21:02.102]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:21:02.403 --> 00:21:02.603]  June 17, 2010.
[00:21:02.683 --> 00:21:03.744]  Gold opened this morning at $1238.40.
[00:21:03.784 --> 00:21:06.767]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1271.33, $635.66 for a half-ounce, or $317.83 for the quarter-ounce.
[00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:07.268]  That's $1271.33, $635.66, or $317.83.
[00:21:19.747 --> 00:21:22.388]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[00:21:22.608 --> 00:21:26.529]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse depression?
[00:21:26.889 --> 00:21:31.490]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:37.852]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks,
[00:21:38.212 --> 00:21:38.272]  Yes.
[00:22:00.492 --> 00:22:05.356]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:22:05.456 --> 00:22:06.237]  What have we got?
[00:22:06.457 --> 00:22:08.579]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:22:08.899 --> 00:22:09.620]  A republic.
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.482]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:22:12.562 --> 00:22:14.464]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:22:14.824 --> 00:22:16.726]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:22:16.846 --> 00:22:18.127]  So they think they own our land?
[00:22:18.527 --> 00:22:19.628]  They think they own our water?
[00:22:19.849 --> 00:22:20.249]  Children?
[00:22:20.449 --> 00:22:21.230]  Our education?
[00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:22.211]  Our money?
[00:22:22.411 --> 00:22:26.054]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:22:26.414 --> 00:22:30.076]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:22:30.116 --> 00:22:31.077]  You are being warned.
[00:22:31.377 --> 00:22:32.218]  We have the facts.
[00:22:32.398 --> 00:22:33.519]  We have the Constitution.
[00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:34.459]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:22:34.479 --> 00:22:35.300]  We have common law.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.621]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:37.881 --> 00:22:40.603]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:22:40.823 --> 00:22:41.704]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:22:41.764 --> 00:22:46.567]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:22:46.727 --> 00:22:48.088]  A new tool in the InfoWars.
[00:22:48.228 --> 00:22:49.068]  Don't Tread on Me.
[00:22:49.309 --> 00:22:50.529]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.740]  For PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.622]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[00:23:03.702 --> 00:23:05.644]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[00:23:05.764 --> 00:23:08.426]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:23:08.506 --> 00:23:10.467]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:23:10.748 --> 00:23:11.928]  Okay, here it comes.
[00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:13.770]  But first, the facts.
[00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.771]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:23:15.991 --> 00:23:17.693]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:23:17.973 --> 00:23:21.456]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:23:21.656 --> 00:23:29.061]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[00:23:29.401 --> 00:23:30.022]  Sinofresh.

[00:23:49.657 --> 00:23:49.998]  Mention GCN.

[00:23:50.958 --> 00:23:51.219]  It worked!
[00:24:05.376 --> 00:24:07.858]  Alright, let me finish up with Scott and have him make his point.
[00:24:07.878 --> 00:24:12.941]  Then I've got to move on to David, Truthmaster, Mark, Kyle, and others that have got their points to make.
[00:24:13.042 --> 00:24:17.485]  And I've got a bunch of news to get to before Lindsey Williams comes on to talk about the oil spill.
[00:24:18.045 --> 00:24:19.726]  Okay, Scott, go ahead.
[00:24:19.746 --> 00:24:21.027]  Hey, man.
[00:24:22.849 --> 00:24:23.989]  I said the wide spectrum.
[00:24:24.009 --> 00:24:25.290]  I didn't just say the esoteric.
[00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.212]  I said the esoteric to the scientific.
[00:24:27.292 --> 00:24:28.813]  But let me go further with this.
[00:24:30.134 --> 00:24:34.317]  You've got people like Richard Hoagland who's talking about the enormous gas bubble that they're seeing.
[00:24:35.014 --> 00:24:41.576]  You got questions about the czars, questions about the Corexit, all the dispersants that they're throwing down.
[00:24:41.896 --> 00:24:46.457]  There's so much about this story that only the alternative media has been telling.
[00:24:46.838 --> 00:24:52.379]  And you, who allegedly have the biggest footprint in the alternative media, have been talking about Chris Matthews.
[00:24:52.839 --> 00:24:56.780]  Nobody a year from now is going to be worried about that MSNBC piece that was done.
[00:24:57.381 --> 00:25:01.942]  But when all those people, all your listeners down in the South, are going to be wondering, where was Alex Jones?
[00:25:02.378 --> 00:25:04.919]  An American reporter, where was he?
[00:25:05.219 --> 00:25:11.100]  Why was he talking about other things and diverting away from a story about something that's decimated us?
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.360]  Well, Scott, this is a hoax.
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.041]  I mean, you ought to go work for MSNBC yourself.
[00:25:16.421 --> 00:25:17.041]  It's a hoax.
[00:25:18.302 --> 00:25:27.584]  And they're going to wonder where was Alex on the Gulf oil spill, talking about it probably more than I should have.
[00:25:28.783 --> 00:25:31.585]  We've been talking about it for 25 minutes with you.
[00:25:31.605 --> 00:25:33.746]  I was talking about it in the first hour.
[00:25:33.786 --> 00:25:35.066]  I was talking about it in the last hour.
[00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:38.708]  It's just, it's just, I shouldn't have spent so much time with Scott.
[00:25:38.748 --> 00:25:43.131]  It's just when you talk to somebody who doesn't hear anything you say.
[00:25:43.171 --> 00:25:44.552]  I just talked about the dispersants.
[00:25:45.132 --> 00:25:46.993]  I'm talking to Lindsey Williams about it next hour.
[00:25:48.073 --> 00:25:49.274]  That was just bizarre.
[00:25:49.594 --> 00:25:50.715]  Just bizarre.
[00:25:52.878 --> 00:25:53.899]  Very strange.
[00:25:54.339 --> 00:25:55.439]  Very, very strange.
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.521]  David in South Carolina.
[00:25:57.781 --> 00:25:58.921]  Sorry to have you hold that long.
[00:25:58.941 --> 00:25:59.281]  Go ahead.
[00:26:01.683 --> 00:26:02.443]  Are you there, Alex?
[00:26:02.723 --> 00:26:03.104]  Yes, sir.
[00:26:03.164 --> 00:26:04.484]  Go ahead and turn that radio off.
[00:26:05.025 --> 00:26:05.965]  Oh, it's a computer.
[00:26:06.245 --> 00:26:07.446]  That's how I listen to you.
[00:26:07.506 --> 00:26:07.606]  No, no.
[00:26:07.626 --> 00:26:09.787]  I understand, but I can hear the last caller.
[00:26:10.007 --> 00:26:10.447]  I can hear him.
[00:26:10.908 --> 00:26:14.850]  My question is not about the Gulf or Iran.
[00:26:16.311 --> 00:26:20.353]  My question is about Obama instructed by a U.N.
[00:26:20.473 --> 00:26:22.494]  ambassador to vote on global
[00:26:23.214 --> 00:26:24.676]  gun control treaty.
[00:26:25.657 --> 00:26:30.022]  And that goes to show you right here, Alex, while Obama got planned
[00:26:30.863 --> 00:26:35.107]  My will say he already had defaced our Constitution.
[00:26:35.147 --> 00:26:35.928]  Hold on, David.
[00:26:35.968 --> 00:26:38.531]  According to Scott, I need to hang up on you right now.
[00:26:39.091 --> 00:26:49.341]  We can't talk about Obama supporting a global gun ban treaty with the UN, which does directly threaten our Second Amendment, or our Attorney General who says we have no right to own guns.
[00:26:50.242 --> 00:26:52.925]  David, you only can talk about the Gulf.
[00:26:53.999 --> 00:26:54.599]  I'm sorry.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:55.760]  I'm sorry, David.
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.501]  I gotta let you go.
[00:26:56.521 --> 00:26:58.682]  Okay?
[00:26:58.842 --> 00:26:59.723]  Where was David?
[00:27:00.383 --> 00:27:04.186]  Where was Alex when the UN was passing a treaty to ban our guns?
[00:27:04.246 --> 00:27:05.727]  Well, we were talking about the oil spill.
[00:27:06.107 --> 00:27:06.848]  Sorry, David!
[00:27:06.868 --> 00:27:08.529]  No, no, I appreciate your call, David.
[00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:09.169]  That is important.
[00:27:09.189 --> 00:27:09.970]  We have talked about it.
[00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.152]  Let's get Larry Pratt on next week.
[00:27:12.172 --> 00:27:17.515]  I know that'll make Scott mad, but let's get Larry Pratt on next week for about 30 minutes about the UN treaty.
[00:27:17.775 --> 00:27:18.856]  That's very serious.
[00:27:19.116 --> 00:27:21.118]  It also shows us the intent of the White House.
[00:27:22.018 --> 00:27:23.700]  Truth Master, you're on the air.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.302]  Better be about the oil spill.
[00:27:25.342 --> 00:27:25.762]  Go ahead.
[00:27:27.103 --> 00:27:31.708]  Okay, well, first of all, this oil spill nonsense is exactly what that is.
[00:27:31.748 --> 00:27:32.449]  It's nonsense.
[00:27:33.309 --> 00:27:38.174]  I can tell you that back in the 70s, I think it was 72, the exact same thing happened.
[00:27:38.574 --> 00:27:40.016]  They tried the exact same
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.882]  Uh, procedures.
[00:27:42.002 --> 00:27:43.164]  They didn't call it Top Hat.
[00:27:43.184 --> 00:27:45.026]  They called it Operation Sombrero.
[00:27:45.347 --> 00:27:46.489]  They tried the top fill.
[00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:47.710]  They tried all of that stuff.
[00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:53.078]  The only thing that worked was drilling in it, and it gushed uncontrollably for 90 days.
[00:27:53.278 --> 00:27:55.682]  Exact same thing happened right there in the Gulf.
[00:27:56.122 --> 00:27:59.807]  Everybody forgot about that but the media made a huge deal about it back then as well.
[00:28:00.247 --> 00:28:01.108]  It's just a distraction.
[00:28:01.148 --> 00:28:10.880]  Because they know something that's like a ticking clock that's day-to-day is a soap opera just like Chandra Levy before the globalists carried out 9-11 and here they are
[00:28:11.681 --> 00:28:16.083]  We're lining the aircraft carriers, the missiles up, getting ready to board the Iranian ships.
[00:28:16.223 --> 00:28:17.643]  Iran says this means war.
[00:28:18.084 --> 00:28:19.484]  Israel's going on board ships.
[00:28:20.084 --> 00:28:23.046]  You know, the globalists are trying to do everything they can to start World War III.
[00:28:23.626 --> 00:28:28.868]  And when people say, where was Alex when World War III was being set up, I was here covering it.
[00:28:28.888 --> 00:28:32.770]  You know, it's kind of like two months, three months before the flu thing started.
[00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.131]  I said they're gearing up for flu hype.
[00:28:35.151 --> 00:28:40.094]  I don't know if it's going to be real or if it's going to be staged, but they're getting ready for martial law.
[00:28:40.154 --> 00:28:52.262]  And I had government documents, I had eyewitnesses, and then I got accused by the COINTELPRO of fear-mongering about the flu when I was the one saying it was a hoax.
[00:28:53.363 --> 00:28:55.144]  Now, that's mind control, isn't it?
[00:28:56.184 --> 00:28:56.464]  It is.
[00:28:57.185 --> 00:29:02.591]  And see, the thing is that as a truth master, I go around and I wake up as many people as I can.
[00:29:02.651 --> 00:29:05.053]  Typically, I get on average 20 to 30 people a year.
[00:29:06.334 --> 00:29:11.660]  Now, I can tell you that all of these people that are just roaming around, that have just got their heads buried in the sand,
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.641]  Are talking about this Gulf oil spill.
[00:29:13.701 --> 00:29:15.302]  I mean people at work everywhere.
[00:29:15.322 --> 00:29:17.463]  And they're saying something's got to be done.
[00:29:17.803 --> 00:29:21.785]  And the media is saying Obama's getting tough with a new tax.
[00:29:22.125 --> 00:29:25.527]  They're going to tax us instead of going after BP.
[00:29:25.867 --> 00:29:30.010]  But the other thing is, Truthmaster, is I feel guilty.
[00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.331]  I've been spending too much time on the stinking spill.
[00:29:32.991 --> 00:29:33.832]  You give me your vote.
[00:29:33.852 --> 00:29:37.434]  Am I spending too much time, not enough time, or just right?
[00:29:38.712 --> 00:29:39.253]  On the issue.
[00:29:40.113 --> 00:29:43.596]  I'd say you're spending too much time on it and I had one other point I wanted to cover.
[00:29:44.497 --> 00:29:46.359]  Stay there though, but it better be on the oil spill.
[00:29:46.819 --> 00:29:47.420]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.022 --> 00:29:53.025]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.945 --> 00:29:56.648]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.369 --> 00:30:03.193]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[00:30:59.468 --> 00:31:02.070]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:07.433]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:07.813 --> 00:31:09.534]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:09.854 --> 00:31:14.657]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:14.857 --> 00:31:15.817]  How much do you want?
[00:31:16.037 --> 00:31:16.778]  When do you want it?
[00:31:17.158 --> 00:31:18.759]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:19.860]  When will you need it?
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.181]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:22.321 --> 00:31:23.422]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:23.662 --> 00:31:24.002]  Will it make
[00:31:24.402 --> 00:31:30.248]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:30.448 --> 00:31:33.632]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:34.032 --> 00:31:37.536]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:37.856 --> 00:31:38.837]  How much will you need?
[00:31:39.077 --> 00:31:39.698]  We don't know.
[00:31:39.998 --> 00:31:40.899]  How much do you want?
[00:31:41.079 --> 00:31:41.820]  All you can get.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.841]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:43.101 --> 00:31:45.865]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:31:46.145 --> 00:31:48.769]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:31:48.989 --> 00:31:49.750]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:02.613]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:02.934 --> 00:32:03.194]  Number 1.
[00:32:03.854 --> 00:32:06.997]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:07.277 --> 00:32:07.837]  Number 2.
[00:32:08.138 --> 00:32:12.681]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:13.021 --> 00:32:13.462]  It's true.
[00:32:13.762 --> 00:32:18.325]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:18.646 --> 00:32:19.186]  Number 3.
[00:32:19.466 --> 00:32:22.749]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:23.049 --> 00:32:26.752]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:26.952 --> 00:32:27.493]  Number 4.
[00:32:27.753 --> 00:32:30.115]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:30.515 --> 00:32:33.898]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:34.198 --> 00:32:34.399]  Number 5.
[00:32:34.979 --> 00:32:38.902]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:39.123 --> 00:32:43.887]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:44.167 --> 00:32:48.190]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.911]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:50.131 --> 00:32:52.213]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:52.373 --> 00:32:54.995]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:55.015 --> 00:33:06.843]  Yep, coming to you from a little place called Texas!
[00:33:08.264 --> 00:33:09.925]  Rumors spreadin' round
[00:33:12.291 --> 00:33:17.976]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:18.056 --> 00:33:22.560]  Look, I need to get into more of the news, and then we've got Lindsey Williams coming up to cover the oil spill.
[00:33:25.643 --> 00:33:28.927]  It's like an oxymoron when somebody criticizes me for something that isn't real.
[00:33:28.987 --> 00:33:33.533]  It's like it gets stuck in my head and then I'll get hundreds of emails saying, why did you have that idiot on that long?
[00:33:33.573 --> 00:33:44.606]  It just really frustrates me because I cover what I think is important and that doesn't mean I'm always right, but I've been doing this longer than most people and I've got a pretty good record of being spot on.
[00:33:46.348 --> 00:33:47.588]  But it's my radio show.
[00:33:47.749 --> 00:33:49.690]  I mean, you know, I'm not bad.
[00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:52.472]  I'm not the one sending the IRS after you to take your property.
[00:33:52.832 --> 00:33:54.513]  I'm not the one launching the new wars.
[00:33:54.653 --> 00:34:00.777]  I'm not the offshore banks selling derivatives to our government and creating a debt black hole that's impossible to pay back.
[00:34:01.297 --> 00:34:06.621]  I'm simply somebody here trying to get people motivated to take action and be leaders in their own right.
[00:34:07.321 --> 00:34:12.288]  But so many times in history, the people that get smashed are the ones that stand up against the evil.
[00:34:12.729 --> 00:34:16.394]  You know, the crowd says, no, we don't like you for telling us about the problem.
[00:34:16.734 --> 00:34:18.096]  You didn't tell us about it right.
[00:34:18.757 --> 00:34:23.324]  Now, I want to get into Iran threatens to stop Western ships if subjected to cargo inspection.
[00:34:23.604 --> 00:34:24.605]  This is big news.
[00:34:26.195 --> 00:34:43.064]  I know the media isn't talking about it every five minutes and saying something must be done and, you know, oh and the media cares so much about the public and what's Obama gonna do and everyone feels like they've been wronged and gets all angry because the TV tells you so, but they don't tell you to get mad at the bankers.
[00:34:44.343 --> 00:34:51.149]  They don't tell you to get mad at the military-industrial complex that wants to pass laws to secretly arrest you and be able to torture you.
[00:34:51.729 --> 00:34:52.950]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:55.853]  All the big issues we're not supposed to be upset about.
[00:34:56.173 --> 00:35:00.076]  We're all whipped up into this big fury, which has much to do about nothing.
[00:35:00.617 --> 00:35:10.044]  And we've also got Bruno Breweiler, who I've talked to, been a guest on the show, gave us some great video that we've put in some of the documentaries.
[00:35:11.229 --> 00:35:13.110]  I've seen We Are Change Los Angeles.
[00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:17.654]  People get beat up by the cops for having a video camera on the street.
[00:35:17.794 --> 00:35:22.778]  I've seen the folks that went into the live program.
[00:35:23.799 --> 00:35:25.760]  They're on HBO with Bill Maher.
[00:35:27.802 --> 00:35:28.702]  They've done a lot of good work.
[00:35:29.543 --> 00:35:32.105]  And this time, well here's the headline, We Are Change L.A.
[00:35:32.145 --> 00:35:34.747]  organizer faces terrorist charge.
[00:35:35.428 --> 00:35:37.749]  And so we'll spend about 10 minutes with him and then go back to your calls.
[00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.711]  But finishing up with
[00:35:42.119 --> 00:35:43.520]  Truthmaster in Florida.
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.301]  You had one other point you wanted to make, Truthmaster.
[00:35:47.501 --> 00:35:51.483]  Yes, and I would say this is one of the most important points of the day.
[00:35:52.643 --> 00:35:55.984]  In regards to the New World Order, that's a failed elite plan.
[00:35:56.365 --> 00:36:02.867]  There's a true plan that there's no stopping that I like to refer to as the true world order.
[00:36:03.067 --> 00:36:09.250]  And that is what's going to be inheriting the Earth here coming shortly after the extinction of most of the lower 92% of the population.
[00:36:10.942 --> 00:36:22.546]  And so my point I just wanted to put out to most people, as a Freemason myself, you need to get yourselves ascended to a higher top 10% in the categories of everyone else who's alive right now.
[00:36:22.826 --> 00:36:25.606]  If you can't, I'm sorry, but you're just not going to be able to make it.
[00:36:26.467 --> 00:36:33.989]  Only those people who've got their minds completely awakened and enlightened, enlightenment is the key, awakening of the egoic consciousness,
[00:36:34.827 --> 00:36:39.191]  Only those people who can pass those tests and those trials are going to survive.
[00:36:39.531 --> 00:36:42.013]  Well, Truthmaster, let me say this.
[00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:46.937]  The New World Order system is that higher level Freemasonic system.
[00:36:47.157 --> 00:36:53.341]  And whether it's the Earth First Battalion at the Pentagon or any of these groups, they say
[00:36:54.222 --> 00:37:00.287]  That they are going to purge the earth of at least 90% of us because our consciousness isn't right.
[00:37:00.668 --> 00:37:04.291]  But I see these very globalists as the ones causing so many of our problems.
[00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:10.055]  And so what you're saying is pure, you know, New World Order speak.
[00:37:10.956 --> 00:37:13.178]  I mean, is this what they teach at your Masonic Lodge?
[00:37:14.379 --> 00:37:15.380]  Well, here's the difference.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.862]  Here's where the confusion comes in.
[00:37:18.763 --> 00:37:21.205]  As hard as it may be to understand, the elite
[00:37:21.974 --> 00:37:22.555]  They're pawns.
[00:37:22.975 --> 00:37:28.619]  They're just being used, and they think they're building their new world order, and yet they're only setting up the true world order.
[00:37:28.639 --> 00:37:29.520]  No, no, I understand.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:50.237]  They're being used to test the true Illuminati, and by them oppressing the people, it will force the true humans to rise up and take dominion over the planet, and so that the real Illuminati... I mean, I had, you know, a business, a computer company owner here in town tell me, you know, Alex, you know, you're really the Illuminati because you're fighting tyranny.
[00:37:50.897 --> 00:38:01.668]  And it's all just a hall of mirrors, but I mean, I understand that philosophy and Jesus is the brother of Lucifer and they're really just twins and it just goes on and on.
[00:38:01.708 --> 00:38:06.233]  But I find the fruits of that is the degradation and tyranny we see today.
[00:38:06.954 --> 00:38:08.615]  What do you say to that truth, Master?
[00:38:09.877 --> 00:38:10.377]  That's true.
[00:38:10.437 --> 00:38:11.538]  That's 100 percent true.
[00:38:11.598 --> 00:38:13.120]  But like I said, it's just
[00:38:13.826 --> 00:38:21.691]  I don't know how you would... flushing out the true inheritance of seeds that were placed long ago that are now... Who do you believe Lucifer is?
[00:38:23.212 --> 00:38:25.453]  Lucifer is the Eastern Star.
[00:38:25.853 --> 00:38:30.496]  He is... The Morning Star, which Christ is also referred to.
[00:38:30.536 --> 00:38:32.377]  That's where you guys get that he's Lucifer.
[00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:34.358]  Guys, pull up... go to YouTube.
[00:38:34.418 --> 00:38:38.741]  Mason says he worships Lucifer or Sweet Lucifer.
[00:38:39.621 --> 00:38:42.302]  Uh, you can walk up to a high-level mason and most of them will admit it.
[00:38:42.342 --> 00:38:43.282]  Like, you got the camera off?
[00:38:43.482 --> 00:38:44.362]  Yes, I love Lucifer.
[00:38:44.562 --> 00:38:45.482]  Lucifer is so good.
[00:38:45.522 --> 00:38:46.003]  Oh my God.
[00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:47.543]  Lucifer is soon going to be here with us.
[00:38:47.663 --> 00:38:48.423]  Oh, it's so wonderful.
[00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:52.844]  And then meanwhile, those very masons are on TV going, there's no occult.
[00:38:52.904 --> 00:38:54.184]  There's no New World Order.
[00:38:54.485 --> 00:38:57.705]  We've got a local program to get your kids in a DNA database.
[00:38:58.165 --> 00:39:00.046]  We are going to help everyone.
[00:39:00.566 --> 00:39:02.226]  So, so, Lucifer is loving?
[00:39:02.566 --> 00:39:05.027]  Is Lucifer pure and virtuous and good?
[00:39:06.283 --> 00:39:07.844]  Lucifer is a pawn himself.
[00:39:08.645 --> 00:39:09.226]  A pawn.
[00:39:09.746 --> 00:39:20.255]  He is also a pawn that is being used to corrupt these high-level people who have souls that do not have the ability to withstand against these tyrannies and these evils.
[00:39:21.116 --> 00:39:22.297]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:39:22.597 --> 00:39:27.578]  Okay, I'm just telling you, out of that whole Masonic thing you're into flows this.
[00:39:27.938 --> 00:39:30.799]  And the low-level Masons, they're not even aware that it's a cult.
[00:39:31.359 --> 00:39:38.861]  And then people that get into the inner sanctums of Freemasonry, you know, they find out that it is Lucifer, but Lucifer's really Jesus.
[00:39:39.722 --> 00:39:48.084]  And, look, any religion where it's secret, any religion where they've got an outer temple and an inner temple, you better look out, okay?
[00:39:49.679 --> 00:40:06.070]  Okay, any religion where you're not allowed to know what's going on, you know, and what the secret inner priesthood is doing, any government, any system, any governmental system that operates like that, you better watch it, okay?
[00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:10.954]  Because it's always about that inner group manipulating and controlling the outer group.
[00:40:11.134 --> 00:40:12.615]  But I'm done talking about it.
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:19.422]  Oh boy, let me just hit this article and then we'll go to Bruno, who really needs your help right now.
[00:40:19.442 --> 00:40:24.324]  And I've seen this so many times, it just shows the bonafide tyranny we're living under in this nation.
[00:40:25.105 --> 00:40:37.290]  And I've seen it over and over again, and we've had guests on, like the guest who exposed government corruption, so that a year and a half the judge has held the guy on contempt, without a contempt hearing, and has now told him you'll be in prison for life, in the jail.
[00:40:38.703 --> 00:40:40.605]  I mean, you know, just, just, this is tyranny.
[00:40:41.406 --> 00:40:42.907]  Take him away to the dungeon!
[00:40:42.967 --> 00:40:43.868]  Take him away!
[00:40:44.269 --> 00:40:46.010]  You done with you, huh?
[00:40:46.391 --> 00:40:49.674]  We'll talk to you in thirty years after you've been clapped in irons.
[00:40:50.094 --> 00:40:53.598]  That'll teach you to ramble the respect of the crown.
[00:40:53.618 --> 00:40:55.920]  That's basically what we're talking about here.
[00:40:57.396 --> 00:40:58.577]  But here's the big news.
[00:40:58.837 --> 00:41:01.078]  This, to me, is the big kahuna.
[00:41:01.118 --> 00:41:01.978]  This is what matters.
[00:41:02.618 --> 00:41:08.481]  Iran threatens to stop Western ships if subjected to cargo inspection.
[00:41:10.261 --> 00:41:21.386]  Iran's parliament has warned it will respond in kind to inspections of its ships under a fourth round of sanctions imposed on the country by the UN Security Council.
[00:41:21.826 --> 00:41:25.467]  A new round of sanctions are being drafted by the United States and the European Union.
[00:41:25.868 --> 00:41:26.548]  We warn
[00:41:28.032 --> 00:41:28.612]  The U.S.
[00:41:28.672 --> 00:41:45.384]  and certain adventurous countries that if they are tempted to inspect Iranian air and ship cargoes, we will take tough action against their ships in the Persian Gulf and Sea of Oman, said Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larjani on Wednesday evening.
[00:41:45.504 --> 00:41:52.789]  Larjani said any retaliation move will be part of the country's policy to defend national interest, according to the Fars News Agency.
[00:41:52.829 --> 00:41:56.592]  That's their main national publication, state-owned system.
[00:41:57.432 --> 00:42:09.337]  The Iranian Parliament calls the government to not lessen the level of uranium enrichment below 20% since these countries have violated the Non-Proliferation Treaty and refused to provide 20% enriched fuel for Tehran's research reactor.
[00:42:09.537 --> 00:42:13.119]  Yeah, Tehran has asked for uranium that cannot be used in any weapon.
[00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:16.240]  Then they offered to give their uranium to France, they said no.
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:17.581]  Then to Turkey, no.
[00:42:17.661 --> 00:42:18.281]  Then Brazil, no!
[00:42:18.481 --> 00:42:18.661]  No!
[00:42:20.202 --> 00:42:21.964]  First Obama said, yeah, give it to Turkey.
[00:42:22.264 --> 00:42:23.886]  They'll enrich it to prove it isn't for bombs.
[00:42:24.247 --> 00:42:25.448]  Okay, here's all uranium.
[00:42:25.648 --> 00:42:26.970]  No, that deal's off the table now.
[00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.192]  We're moving nukes, subs in, and aircraft carriers.
[00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:31.235]  We're going to start boarding your ships.
[00:42:31.335 --> 00:42:32.176]  Nothing's allowed in.
[00:42:32.836 --> 00:42:34.759]  They can only refine roughly half of the oil.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.602]  Okay, they have a lot of oil, but not the refinery system.
[00:42:37.622 --> 00:42:38.283]  Those are expensive.
[00:42:39.414 --> 00:42:41.877]  I mean, it's hard to build up a society, folks.
[00:42:41.897 --> 00:42:43.079]  It's hard to build up a civilization.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.421]  And this isn't cheap.
[00:42:44.441 --> 00:42:46.463]  That's why when they blew up Belgrade, it was such a problem.
[00:42:46.684 --> 00:42:49.788]  They blow up anything with bombardments that's self-sufficient.
[00:42:50.429 --> 00:42:54.254]  And so, Iran's getting self-sufficient, and the globalists are like, we're gonna blow the hell out of you!
[00:42:55.592 --> 00:42:59.416]  And this will... Muslims are going to riot all over the world.
[00:42:59.797 --> 00:43:01.519]  The Iranians are going to go into Iraq.
[00:43:02.139 --> 00:43:06.064]  The globalists will stage terror attacks, say Iran did it, and World War III is off the races.
[00:43:06.384 --> 00:43:08.266]  And China said they may get involved.
[00:43:08.567 --> 00:43:09.428]  And so is Russia.
[00:43:09.908 --> 00:43:12.191]  I mean, folks, this is serious business!
[00:43:13.513 --> 00:43:18.115]  But, you know, once our ships are getting hit by missiles and there's death, the American flags are going to go out.
[00:43:18.395 --> 00:43:22.657]  Good old boys are going to be, I don't care if the government's got to raise my taxes.
[00:43:22.917 --> 00:43:24.738]  Forget what happened with the economy.
[00:43:25.058 --> 00:43:28.900]  We're in a war and I want to kill Millionaire Ab!
[00:43:33.038 --> 00:43:36.040]  And then you won't worry about Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan ripping you off.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.842]  You won't worry about the open borders and the illegal aliens.
[00:43:38.862 --> 00:43:40.243]  You won't worry about all the tyranny.
[00:43:40.543 --> 00:43:43.506]  You won't worry about that because you're going to be in a war!
[00:43:44.646 --> 00:43:48.189]  And while they're getting their war ready, they blew that oil cap.
[00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:51.952]  Every piece of evidence points at that as a pretext.
[00:43:53.357 --> 00:43:58.399]  You know, I love Lindsey Williams, but no, I don't think the elite knew this was coming and dumped their stock because they had a Ouija board.
[00:43:58.839 --> 00:44:01.620]  They knew what was coming and they dumped the stock because they pulled this.
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:09.723]  Either they ordered it to be done, or the evidence is showing that for two weeks the people on those oil rigs were throwing fits, saying, look, this is going to blow up.
[00:44:09.783 --> 00:44:10.964]  This has never been done this way.
[00:44:11.704 --> 00:44:14.285]  You're not putting cement in and mud, you're putting water in.
[00:44:14.545 --> 00:44:15.565]  This is going to blow out.
[00:44:15.626 --> 00:44:16.486]  This is dangerous.
[00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:23.633]  So they gave them orders that they knew were going to cause it to blow up for the political diversion you now see.
[00:44:23.973 --> 00:44:28.856]  I told you 50-something days ago Obama was going to call for a carbon tax to clean this up.
[00:44:29.796 --> 00:44:30.797]  And now what's he done?
[00:44:30.917 --> 00:44:32.118]  I mean, come on!
[00:44:32.438 --> 00:44:33.338]  Come on!
[00:44:34.519 --> 00:44:42.183]  The reason this oil thing is big news is the feds wouldn't let the states protect themselves because the feds are out of control and the states have been castrated.
[00:44:44.608 --> 00:44:46.469]  Why did the states follow?
[00:44:46.529 --> 00:44:49.531]  I mean, that's an issue for people in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama.
[00:44:49.811 --> 00:44:55.134]  Why are you letting your state houses sit there until it was too late and not put up their own booms, their own sand berms?
[00:44:55.354 --> 00:45:00.757]  Why did you let Barack Hussein, Barry Sotaro, Obama tell you what to do?
[00:45:02.798 --> 00:45:07.581]  Meanwhile, while we're talking about this, they're getting ready for World War III, and the banks are stealing trillions a month!
[00:45:08.919 --> 00:45:11.001]  Alright, I'm going to shut up now and get to this important article.
[00:45:11.021 --> 00:45:12.442]  It's up at WeAreChange.org.
[00:45:12.702 --> 00:45:14.443]  It's also up at InfoWars.com.
[00:45:15.044 --> 00:45:15.844]  WeAreChange L.A.
[00:45:15.884 --> 00:45:17.786]  organizer faces terrorist charge.
[00:45:18.666 --> 00:45:19.387]  And you can read it.
[00:45:19.427 --> 00:45:21.589]  He was making faces the judge didn't like.
[00:45:21.629 --> 00:45:22.870]  And I see this all the time now.
[00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:24.551]  And the cops grabbed him.
[00:45:24.571 --> 00:45:25.231]  He didn't resist.
[00:45:25.251 --> 00:45:26.232]  There's witnesses to this.
[00:45:26.732 --> 00:45:28.073]  And they said, we don't care, boy.
[00:45:28.113 --> 00:45:28.794]  You attacked us.
[00:45:28.854 --> 00:45:29.775]  And this is the new thing.
[00:45:30.095 --> 00:45:33.678]  Cops will beat you up on camera and send you to... Remember Kelly Rushing?
[00:45:34.218 --> 00:45:39.982]  They charged him with threatening police for giving him a Ron Paul, and in one of my videos charged him one count for each video.
[00:45:40.903 --> 00:45:48.468]  And then it was in the news, they said he's facing, was it two counts, three years, six years, seven years, in prison for giving out videos.
[00:45:49.008 --> 00:45:50.809]  A lot of these cops don't see us as humans.
[00:45:50.849 --> 00:45:53.871]  They enjoy throwing milk cows in prison.
[00:45:54.172 --> 00:45:55.352]  We are seen as slaves.
[00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:58.695]  And when a slave gets uppity, they gotta be put in their place.
[00:45:59.395 --> 00:46:08.910]  Well, a slave out in L.A., command base central for the New World Order on the West Coast, they're trying to send this 9-11 truther, who I know, Bruno Breweiler, to the Huskow.
[00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:11.554]  Bruno, tell us what you're facing and how we can help you.
[00:46:13.089 --> 00:46:15.089]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me on.
[00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:20.731]  Yeah, I'm facing, if they succeed with their charges, I'm facing three years in prison.
[00:46:20.751 --> 00:46:28.913]  They charged me with two felony resisting arrest, which means I got violent, but the witnesses have said, when they asked me to turn around and put my hands behind my back.
[00:46:28.933 --> 00:46:31.073]  But it's going to be their word against a God.
[00:46:31.173 --> 00:46:32.234]  Their word against a God.
[00:46:32.254 --> 00:46:33.614]  You're just a scum American.
[00:46:34.294 --> 00:46:35.214]  But please continue.
[00:46:35.774 --> 00:46:38.355]  Okay, yeah, so that's on, but tell folks how this all started though.
[00:46:39.475 --> 00:46:45.037]  Oh, I was in the audience for a friend and the judge didn't like the facial expressions I was making.
[00:46:45.097 --> 00:46:49.979]  I mean, if I were nodding in agreement with her, then of course she wouldn't have said anything.
[00:46:50.059 --> 00:46:52.540]  And I wasn't even aware of the facial expressions.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.421]  Oh, she'll show you, scum!
[00:46:54.781 --> 00:46:56.522]  You don't get up any with a God!
[00:46:57.262 --> 00:47:00.787]  You, you're gonna, you're gonna, his officers are gonna show you!
[00:47:01.889 --> 00:47:04.493]  The mafia's, the mafia's got the courts now!
[00:47:04.773 --> 00:47:06.215]  He's gonna show you, Bruno!
[00:47:06.496 --> 00:47:09.180]  So, so, so, so tell us what happened, blow by blow.
[00:47:10.718 --> 00:47:17.361]  Uh, so I walked out and she told the bailiffs to take me out, or to remove me, but I walked out on my own accord, no resistance.
[00:47:17.381 --> 00:47:24.825]  They closed the door behind me and I just asked the police officers for their IDs, which they're required to by law to show their IDs.
[00:47:25.165 --> 00:47:29.547]  And before I knew it, they were asking me to turn around and put my hands behind my back.
[00:47:29.567 --> 00:47:33.830]  Boy, you did get up and you actually talked to a God?
[00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:39.411]  Yeah, they called me crazy because I was standing up for my rights.
[00:47:39.471 --> 00:47:41.872]  I was speaking about the right.
[00:47:42.012 --> 00:47:44.913]  Did Moses look directly at God or did he look at a burning bush?
[00:47:45.973 --> 00:47:53.776]  You don't, you don't, you don't, I mean you don't, again this is God level, you don't look upon the face of your king, your leader.
[00:47:54.456 --> 00:47:57.537]  The blood flows through your veins because of those police, those bailiffs.
[00:47:58.237 --> 00:48:00.798]  I'm going to quit being sarcastic, you're facing serious jail time.
[00:48:01.038 --> 00:48:01.878]  So what happened next?
[00:48:04.088 --> 00:48:18.099]  Uh, they tacked on a terrorist threat, uh, and the whole time I was just speaking about the importance of the police work with the people in relation, you know, the police need to be with the people and not with the, uh, enforcing the fraud of the courts.
[00:48:19.495 --> 00:48:22.318]  You know, this guy was just out of control.
[00:48:22.398 --> 00:48:23.940]  He's a hothead.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.084]  He just slapped major felony charges against me.
[00:48:27.224 --> 00:48:29.907]  You know, it's just ruthless and tyrannical.
[00:48:30.728 --> 00:48:34.472]  And so I'm going to the courts right now, and I need money.
[00:48:34.512 --> 00:48:35.012]  I need help.
[00:48:35.653 --> 00:48:36.834]  This is very expensive.
[00:48:37.855 --> 00:48:44.317]  And I have a strong case because I have witnesses and I have the truth on my side.
[00:48:44.377 --> 00:48:45.577]  Here's the deal.
[00:48:46.197 --> 00:48:52.059]  We need official oppression, racketeering, civil rights violation, you know, frame up here.
[00:48:52.559 --> 00:48:57.881]  What you need is a good constitutional lawyer in the Southern California area that wants to protect you.
[00:48:57.921 --> 00:48:58.661]  We got that.
[00:48:59.807 --> 00:49:12.293]  For Jeremy Talus, goes by German Talus, when they did the Bush setup with the girl in the wheelchair for Fox News, came out of the dark, and then they said, you know, you're facing a decade in prison, he wouldn't plea bargain.
[00:49:12.773 --> 00:49:15.455]  The Secret Service agent got up on stand and said, I will not lie.
[00:49:15.915 --> 00:49:19.677]  They attacked him, and they had to release him, and the New York Post had to retract.
[00:49:20.297 --> 00:49:25.039]  With you, it's the same deal, and you need a constitutional lawyer.
[00:49:25.079 --> 00:49:26.000]  How do they contact you?
[00:49:27.951 --> 00:49:34.092]  Uh, you can reach me at, uh, through the, uh, if I give you the email address.
[00:49:34.272 --> 00:49:37.253]  I don't want to give my email address, but with the, uh, the radio.
[00:49:37.953 --> 00:49:41.473]  Yeah, Bruno, we want to help you, so, so is there a way for people to get in touch with you?
[00:49:42.794 --> 00:49:46.054]  Yeah, contact me through the, you know what, I'll just go ahead and do it.
[00:49:46.074 --> 00:49:56.256]  It's B-B-R-U-H-W-I-L-E-R, and the number eight, that's my first initial and last name, bbruehler8 at gmail.com.
[00:49:57.737 --> 00:49:58.858]  You can go to WACLA.org.
[00:49:58.898 --> 00:50:02.640]  That's W-A-C-L-A dot org.
[00:50:03.401 --> 00:50:08.044]  And also there's free-bruno.org.
[00:50:08.804 --> 00:50:13.507]  And I got a, there's a lot of fans out there of yours that have helped me.
[00:50:13.547 --> 00:50:15.648]  I got to throw out some names.
[00:50:15.929 --> 00:50:22.413]  David in Chile, Alejandro, and my brother Jay Black and his company Joomla XTC.
[00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:23.794]  They're huge fans.
[00:50:23.834 --> 00:50:25.655]  These are all truthers around the world.
[00:50:26.375 --> 00:50:33.178]  My brothers and we are Change Hauling, that's Robin and Paul, and we're Change New York, Dan, and everyone here in L.A.
[00:50:33.218 --> 00:50:35.999]  has been so, the love has been unbelievable.
[00:50:36.019 --> 00:50:41.402]  Bruno, that is awesome, but again, especially in L.A., they're just, take them away to the dungeon.
[00:50:42.742 --> 00:50:52.207]  There's no judge, no jury, no nothing, you're just gone, but in this case there is a judge whose sickness thugs on you, and these guys are so inhuman.
[00:50:59.764 --> 00:51:00.304]  You worry.
[00:51:00.445 --> 00:51:02.526]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[00:51:02.806 --> 00:51:03.086]  Hi.
[00:51:03.346 --> 00:51:05.828]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[00:51:06.128 --> 00:51:10.371]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[00:51:10.671 --> 00:51:12.852]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[00:51:13.152 --> 00:51:16.194]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[00:51:16.494 --> 00:51:17.295]  Author Linda Runyon
[00:51:18.419 --> 00:51:20.942]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[00:51:21.202 --> 00:51:24.645]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[00:51:24.926 --> 00:51:29.030]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:33.134]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[00:51:33.434 --> 00:51:36.157]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator
[00:51:38.459 --> 00:51:38.739]  I think so.
[00:51:59.861 --> 00:52:02.182]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:02.202 --> 00:52:04.463]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:04.563 --> 00:52:07.345]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:07.785 --> 00:52:12.528]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:12.888 --> 00:52:17.070]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:19.732]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:19.752 --> 00:52:22.254]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:22.274 --> 00:52:25.176]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:25.537 --> 00:52:33.123]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:33.479 --> 00:52:38.723]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:38.863 --> 00:52:41.145]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.185 --> 00:52:45.148]  So it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.408 --> 00:52:46.309]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:46.469 --> 00:52:47.790]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:48.831]  Invisible Empire.

[00:52:59.275 --> 00:53:02.619]  It's the number one reason for slow and clogged bath drains.
[00:53:02.879 --> 00:53:04.180]  That's right, hair.
[00:53:04.541 --> 00:53:07.484]  And the number one way to open drains plugged with hair?
[00:53:07.764 --> 00:53:08.805]  The drain claw.
[00:53:09.666 --> 00:53:11.628]  Stop standing in dirty bath water.
[00:53:11.848 --> 00:53:13.510]  Stop using dangerous chemicals.
[00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:18.175]  Just push the drain claw past the pop-up in your sink or tub, twist, and pull.
[00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:21.859]  You'll be shocked at what this little tool can pull out of your drain.

[00:54:10.188 --> 00:54:15.871]  We got Lindsey Williams coming up because listeners wanted to be able to talk to him and ask him questions.
[00:54:15.911 --> 00:54:22.534]  We'll have to clear the phone lines out once he's on with us and just open the phones up for specific questions for Lindsey Williams at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:28.322 --> 00:54:31.543]  Bruno Breweiler of We Are Change LA, a great guy.
[00:54:31.563 --> 00:54:37.486]  We've interviewed him four or five times in the past with news stories they've been working on out in Los Angeles.
[00:54:38.106 --> 00:54:39.566]  And it's a real shame to see this.
[00:54:39.666 --> 00:54:46.629]  And look, I don't like bashing police, but police are the enforcers for this out-of-control, illegitimate government.
[00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:48.650]  And more and more,
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:59.545]  We've all seen the videos of cops just beating the daylights out of somebody and then setting them up and charging them with attacking the cops.
[00:54:59.965 --> 00:55:00.606]  On video!
[00:55:01.026 --> 00:55:04.248]  Cops don't care you have video of them beating you up.
[00:55:04.388 --> 00:55:06.709]  They will then say, it's not enough I broke your nose.
[00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:09.391]  I'm going to charge you with assaulting me now.
[00:55:10.271 --> 00:55:11.812]  And Bruno's got all these witnesses.
[00:55:12.692 --> 00:55:14.993]  Need to subpoena the surveillance camera tapes.
[00:55:16.173 --> 00:55:19.514]  And just don't plea bargain, whatever you do, and push it all the way to a trial.
[00:55:20.995 --> 00:55:26.277]  And just literally almost wear a mask or the judge will say you're being disrespectful, life in prison.
[00:55:26.617 --> 00:55:28.357]  And I'm not joking about Los Angeles.
[00:55:28.377 --> 00:55:33.879]  I mean, it is just a pit of evil where real criminals are released, citizens.
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.760]  Look, it's about letting slaves know.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.541]  It's like the movie
[00:55:38.806 --> 00:55:39.487]  It's not ants.
[00:55:39.527 --> 00:55:40.228]  What's the name of it?
[00:55:41.148 --> 00:55:42.510]  About a bug's life.
[00:55:43.351 --> 00:55:48.256]  Where they say if we let one of those ants stand up to us, they'll all stand up.
[00:55:48.976 --> 00:55:49.637]  And I've seen it.
[00:55:50.118 --> 00:55:51.299]  I mean, I've experienced it.
[00:55:53.854 --> 00:55:56.615]  Cops are now taught, look, citizens are scum.
[00:55:57.015 --> 00:55:59.375]  It's better just to get them in the criminal justice system.
[00:55:59.695 --> 00:56:01.496]  That way we get their Second Amendment rights.
[00:56:01.836 --> 00:56:03.296]  That way they're in the system.
[00:56:03.556 --> 00:56:04.917]  So go ahead and frame people.
[00:56:05.217 --> 00:56:06.517]  Go ahead and get them to the system.
[00:56:06.777 --> 00:56:08.198]  This is how we protect America.
[00:56:08.478 --> 00:56:10.338]  They've been taught that criminality is good.
[00:56:10.778 --> 00:56:13.079]  Now how many cops are bearing false witness against you?
[00:56:15.402 --> 00:56:20.025]  There's two main ones and then probably a third one.
[00:56:21.186 --> 00:56:22.167]  I should say bailiffs.
[00:56:22.207 --> 00:56:23.548]  Are these bailiffs or cops?
[00:56:25.969 --> 00:56:28.191]  They're cops in the court.
[00:56:28.631 --> 00:56:30.633]  So these are court worshippers.
[00:56:30.673 --> 00:56:41.081]  These are Praetorian Guard who are there every day where kids are being taken, money's being taken, the court's gorging itself fat and bloated like a giant tick off the people of LA.
[00:56:41.361 --> 00:56:44.083]  Here comes a slave that gets up and away to the dungeon.
[00:56:45.034 --> 00:56:46.034]  Yep, exactly.
[00:56:46.895 --> 00:56:54.537]  And, uh, it takes, you know, I've got, again, I've got a strong case, if I can get a good attorney, uh, who will stand up to the judges.
[00:56:54.557 --> 00:56:59.499]  You know, I'm being, you know, even in the court, they're railroading me through the procedures.
[00:56:59.559 --> 00:57:06.041]  They're violating procedural, uh, processes, and, uh, so I need someone who can stand up to the judge.
[00:57:06.061 --> 00:57:07.261]  Well, you need to put continuances in.
[00:57:07.281 --> 00:57:08.422]  You need to prepare your case.
[00:57:09.318 --> 00:57:12.560]  Yeah, we've got one continuing 10, so we've got a few weeks.
[00:57:13.801 --> 00:57:20.486]  Tell me about these cops though, I mean did their eyes glare with pleasure as they set you up and let you know you were being charged?
[00:57:20.747 --> 00:57:21.387]  Little man!
[00:57:22.128 --> 00:57:23.088]  Little American!
[00:57:23.348 --> 00:57:24.189]  I've got you!
[00:57:24.449 --> 00:57:25.610]  I'm ruining your future!
[00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:27.632]  I lie about people all day!
[00:57:27.652 --> 00:57:29.133]  And I pack the prisons!
[00:57:29.193 --> 00:57:30.594]  I'm a hardcore crook!
[00:57:31.678 --> 00:57:36.442]  You should have seen the pleasure on his face when he said, oh, I'm going to charge you with terrorist threat.
[00:57:36.962 --> 00:57:38.863]  And he made his underling be a witness.
[00:57:38.884 --> 00:57:41.686]  You're going to be a witness in order to be a false witness.
[00:57:42.046 --> 00:57:44.508]  And he had this glee, his smile on his face.
[00:57:44.668 --> 00:57:45.388]  Oh, yes.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.540]  Oh, yes!
[00:57:47.821 --> 00:57:47.941]  Oh!
[00:57:47.961 --> 00:57:51.082]  Oh, there's so many Americans to dominate!
[00:57:51.342 --> 00:57:54.723]  This government's given us so much power to abuse them!
[00:57:55.023 --> 00:57:56.564]  Thank you, New World Order!
[00:57:56.904 --> 00:57:57.424]  Thank you!
[00:57:57.464 --> 00:58:01.666]  There's no end to these slaves, and they bend over to all of it!
[00:58:02.326 --> 00:58:03.687]  Oh, give us everything!
[00:58:04.067 --> 00:58:07.008]  I'll give the bankers all the money, just give me petty power!
[00:58:07.648 --> 00:58:14.033]  And that's the worst part about a tyranny, is all these petty nobodies get to just run wild and have this false status over everyone else.
[00:58:14.454 --> 00:58:15.715]  Bruno, we're in your corner.
[00:58:16.796 --> 00:58:18.858]  Give people the... Yep, go ahead.
[00:58:18.878 --> 00:58:20.819]  Tell people to go to wacla.org.
[00:58:21.019 --> 00:58:22.761]  There's a chip in there.
[00:58:22.921 --> 00:58:23.722]  Please go there.
[00:58:23.742 --> 00:58:27.545]  It's easy to donate any amount.
[00:58:27.565 --> 00:58:28.986]  $5, $10, $100, whatever you can give.
[00:58:29.006 --> 00:58:30.387]  Yeah, Bruno, we're out of time.
[00:58:30.728 --> 00:58:32.129]  Bruno, we'll talk to you as this develops.
[00:58:33.354 --> 00:58:34.115]  Absolutely.
[00:58:34.396 --> 00:58:35.177]  Yep, we're out of time.
[00:58:35.197 --> 00:58:36.979]  Alright, we're going to come back with the next hour.
[00:58:37.059 --> 00:58:37.800]  Stay with us.

[00:59:10.506 --> 00:59:12.848]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:59:13.169 --> 00:59:19.374]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[00:59:47.477 --> 00:59:47.917]  Thank you.
[00:59:52.458 --> 00:59:54.399]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.839 --> 00:59:57.620]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:11.181 --> 01:00:17.026]  All right, my friends, we are back live.
[01:00:17.266 --> 01:00:19.388]  This is the fourth and final hour.
[01:00:19.448 --> 01:00:20.869]  I've got some other important news.
[01:00:21.389 --> 01:00:31.497]  I'll be interspersing in the intro to each segment on other subjects, but I wanted to get Lindsey Williams on for an update and to take your phone calls in this final hour.
[01:00:32.037 --> 01:00:47.628]  Lindsay Williams, of course, a pastor, a pilot, worked for many years in the rough oil fields of Alaska, got hired to be part of Atlantic Richfield and other board meetings, got to know some top globalists, one of them who has attended Bilderberg meetings.
[01:00:48.209 --> 01:00:52.072]  Dr. Stan Monteith and I have both confirmed and know the individual he's talking about.
[01:00:52.112 --> 01:00:53.112]  We know he has the source.
[01:00:53.833 --> 01:01:00.277]  And a lot of what he talked about a week and a half ago or so here on air has now come out, that the leak is
[01:01:01.294 --> 01:01:03.215]  Many, many times worse than what they said.
[01:01:03.235 --> 01:01:10.861]  It is coming out at a record pressure level, but there is an unusual amount of toxic chemicals mixed in with this oil.
[01:01:11.181 --> 01:01:20.608]  Oil always has quite a bit of other toxic elements in it, but this is a particularly nasty stuff, and this may be a new strata they've gone into in this super deep well, as they're called.
[01:01:21.588 --> 01:01:29.495]  But I want to get him on with just a brief recap of the info he covered last week, and then I got a bunch of calls about it.
[01:01:29.515 --> 01:01:30.816]  I didn't hear it myself.
[01:01:30.876 --> 01:01:39.503]  He was on coast-to-coast with George Norrie and said, George, if the American people knew who was in control of their military, they would be very upset.
[01:01:40.103 --> 01:01:46.809]  Well, I know the Army War College and Thomas Barnett and the Naval War College brags that it's totally run by offshore banks and the Federal Reserve.
[01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:49.551]  I don't know if that's the intel Williams was given.
[01:01:49.951 --> 01:01:52.754]  But he's here with us today and I'm going to have to wipe the phone lines.
[01:01:52.794 --> 01:01:53.855]  Sorry to those that we're holding.
[01:01:54.335 --> 01:01:54.855]  Or you know what?
[01:01:55.796 --> 01:01:57.177]  I guess we can go to those that we're holding.
[01:01:57.217 --> 01:02:00.500]  It's just that I want to be able to get to people for Lindsey Williams.
[01:02:01.361 --> 01:02:01.861]  So let's be
[01:02:02.722 --> 01:02:06.844]  I guess Alan, Mark, Grant, Andrew, and others.
[01:02:06.864 --> 01:02:10.245]  We're going to get to you.
[01:02:10.666 --> 01:02:12.587]  The 1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[01:02:13.227 --> 01:02:20.070]  But Lindsey Williams recapping your Inside Intel on the oil spill, and then let's go forward.
[01:02:21.244 --> 01:02:27.465]  Alex, thank you for allowing me the privilege of being here today with you in order to be able to give you an update.
[01:02:28.225 --> 01:02:36.867]  Alex, I've got to say first, before we even begin, I had the most heart-rending radio talk show on yesterday I've ever had in my life.
[01:02:37.427 --> 01:02:39.067]  I'm sure you can hear it in my voice.
[01:02:39.787 --> 01:02:41.407]  I have never been moved this much.
[01:02:41.427 --> 01:02:50.269]  A radio talk show host in Orlando, Florida called me, and he said, Chaplain Williams, you have got to be on my show immediately.
[01:02:50.911 --> 01:02:52.655]  I told him I said I can't, I'm too tired.
[01:02:52.795 --> 01:02:54.498]  I've been doing night with this.
[01:02:54.839 --> 01:02:56.663]  He said you've got to, you don't have any choice.
[01:02:57.432 --> 01:02:58.833]  He had me on for an hour.
[01:02:58.873 --> 01:02:59.993]  He asked me for an hour.
[01:03:00.033 --> 01:03:01.393]  He said, at least give me an hour.
[01:03:01.854 --> 01:03:03.334]  Now, this is Orlando, Florida.
[01:03:03.814 --> 01:03:05.455]  I said, why do you want me on?
[01:03:05.995 --> 01:03:11.297]  He said, Chaplain, I came down with a respiratory problem myself one week ago.
[01:03:11.317 --> 01:03:16.019]  He said, for the past three days, I have wanted to throw up all the time.
[01:03:16.039 --> 01:03:18.659]  He said, I felt so nauseated.
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:21.100]  He said, members of my family have problems.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.481]  He said, people in Florida are upset.
[01:03:23.941 --> 01:03:25.602]  He said, please go on my show.
[01:03:26.707 --> 01:03:27.411]  We went on.
[01:03:27.491 --> 01:03:29.984]  It was the first hour.
[01:03:31.071 --> 01:03:32.052]  I gave my material.
[01:03:32.072 --> 01:03:34.233]  The second hour, Alex, I have never had this.
[01:03:34.313 --> 01:03:36.355]  I've been doing radio shows for 35 years.
[01:03:36.895 --> 01:03:39.456]  Every phone line in his studio lit up.
[01:03:39.997 --> 01:03:42.478]  And stayed lit up for the entire second hour.
[01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:43.399]  He said, you can't go.
[01:03:43.419 --> 01:03:45.280]  You've got to stay with us.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.241]  Alex, I've never heard such testimony.
[01:03:47.261 --> 01:03:49.343]  These people are getting sick down there.
[01:03:49.363 --> 01:03:54.306]  I mean, there are problems in Florida that'll be... I heard this with my own ears.
[01:03:54.386 --> 01:03:55.787]  This was yesterday.
[01:03:56.547 --> 01:03:57.008]  Right now.
[01:03:58.095 --> 01:04:05.597]  Well, a couple days after you were on... I have never had this many phone calls on any radio show I've ever done in all of my years.
[01:04:06.197 --> 01:04:08.217]  Well, I mean, a few... Sure.
[01:04:08.297 --> 01:04:08.897]  It's heart-rending.
[01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:13.798]  He said, Chaplin, there are only two highways out of Florida, two interstates.
[01:04:14.398 --> 01:04:19.199]  And he said there are two canals that cross both of those interstate highways.
[01:04:19.659 --> 01:04:21.400]  He said they could block us in here.
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:22.820]  People were scared.
[01:04:23.504 --> 01:04:29.029]  Now these canals run east and west, and the two interstate highways run north and south.
[01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:32.312]  He said, we are stuck here.
[01:04:32.852 --> 01:04:42.141]  He said they could block the highway at those two canals that run east and west, and he said nobody could move in and out of Florida unless they told us we could.
[01:04:42.161 --> 01:04:50.008]  Alex, I just had to mention this because people all over America, they don't realize how desperate it is in Florida.
[01:04:50.248 --> 01:04:51.909]  All right, Lindsey, we've got a break.
[01:04:52.169 --> 01:04:53.349]  We're gonna have to break right here.
[01:04:53.369 --> 01:04:55.750]  We're gonna come back with Lindsey Williams on the other side.
[01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:57.331]  I'm Alex Jones, Infowars.com.
[01:04:57.351 --> 01:04:58.311]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.171 --> 01:05:01.472]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:05:01.492 --> 01:05:03.773]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:05:03.873 --> 01:05:06.674]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:05:07.094 --> 01:05:11.836]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:05:12.196 --> 01:05:16.378]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:05:16.698 --> 01:05:19.039]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:05:19.159 --> 01:05:21.560]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:24.481]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:05:24.842 --> 01:05:32.445]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:05:32.785 --> 01:05:38.068]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:05:38.168 --> 01:05:40.450]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:44.452]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:05:44.712 --> 01:05:45.633]  And I got news for you.
[01:05:45.773 --> 01:05:47.074]  You're everyone else.
[01:05:47.114 --> 01:05:48.134]  Invisible Empire.

[01:05:59.619 --> 01:06:02.222]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:02.642 --> 01:06:07.607]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:07.967 --> 01:06:09.689]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:10.009 --> 01:06:14.834]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:15.014 --> 01:06:15.975]  How much do you want?
[01:06:16.195 --> 01:06:16.956]  When do you want it?
[01:06:17.337 --> 01:06:18.918]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:19.218 --> 01:06:20.039]  When will you need it?
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.342]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:22.502 --> 01:06:23.483]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:23.803 --> 01:06:27.706]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[01:06:27.886 --> 01:06:30.408]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:30.608 --> 01:06:33.791]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:37.694]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:38.014 --> 01:06:38.995]  How much will you need?
[01:06:39.235 --> 01:06:39.856]  We don't know.
[01:06:40.136 --> 01:06:41.057]  How much do you want?
[01:06:41.237 --> 01:06:41.957]  All you can get.
[01:06:41.977 --> 01:06:42.878]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:43.358 --> 01:06:43.979]  We're good to go.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:03.584]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:07:03.684 --> 01:07:04.464]  What have we got?
[01:07:04.685 --> 01:07:06.826]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:07:07.127 --> 01:07:07.867]  A republic.
[01:07:08.127 --> 01:07:10.709]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:07:10.769 --> 01:07:12.691]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:07:13.051 --> 01:07:14.953]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:16.354]  So they think they own our land?
[01:07:16.754 --> 01:07:17.875]  They think they own our water?
[01:07:18.075 --> 01:07:18.475]  Children?
[01:07:18.676 --> 01:07:19.476]  Our education?
[01:07:19.796 --> 01:07:20.417]  Our money?
[01:07:20.617 --> 01:07:24.280]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.284]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:07:29.626 --> 01:07:30.427]  We have the facts.
[01:07:30.627 --> 01:07:31.748]  We have the Constitution.
[01:07:31.788 --> 01:07:32.689]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:07:32.709 --> 01:07:33.530]  We have common law.
[01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:35.852]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:36.113 --> 01:07:39.897]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:07:39.997 --> 01:07:44.780]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:46.321]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:07:46.441 --> 01:07:47.302]  Don't tread on me.
[01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:58.049]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:08:00.151 --> 01:08:05.735]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.105 --> 01:08:16.446]  We're going to Lindsey Williams for the rest of the hour.
[01:08:16.506 --> 01:08:19.847]  I may even go into 15-20 minutes of overdrive if he can do it.
[01:08:20.247 --> 01:08:22.567]  Because we've got loaded phones, people don't want to talk to him.
[01:08:22.907 --> 01:08:25.868]  But Rob Dude just got back from Chicago right now.
[01:08:26.648 --> 01:08:28.089]  Five days in Chicago.
[01:08:28.449 --> 01:08:32.710]  We saw a little MSNBC article about troops for five days of terror drill.
[01:08:33.811 --> 01:08:44.014]  And we noticed in the actual press releases put out by the Army that the Army was going to be training with local police in neighborhoods to quote take on American drug dealers and gun owners.
[01:08:45.546 --> 01:08:53.528]  Rob Dude just walked in, just got off the plane, he walked in here totally white-faced, you know, like a ghost, and said, we have it.
[01:08:53.648 --> 01:08:54.968]  And I said, you have what?
[01:08:55.268 --> 01:08:56.848]  It'll be on tomorrow to tell us about it.
[01:08:57.169 --> 01:09:03.850]  But while everybody's looking at the oil spill, which is important, I'm looking at Iran, I'm looking at military drills in Chicago.
[01:09:04.330 --> 01:09:05.610]  Tell folks what you witnessed, dude.
[01:09:06.151 --> 01:09:12.632]  Well, apparently since the mid-90s, the National Guard in Illinois has been working with Poland
[01:09:13.419 --> 01:09:13.659]  I don't
[01:09:33.446 --> 01:09:41.848]  On camera, one of the City of Chicago terror officials, our emergency management official, said they're just there observing.
[01:09:41.908 --> 01:09:42.988]  They're just there to observe.
[01:09:43.068 --> 01:09:57.252]  And of course, in Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, that you co-directed with me and Douglas, we had the colonel, we interviewed the colonel, who admitted the Army was training for gun confiscation in Iowa, and I've been to the drills a decade ago where they were training to take on American gun owners.
[01:09:57.332 --> 01:09:59.332]  Folks, the military is training.
[01:09:59.372 --> 01:10:00.593]  It was in NLE-09.
[01:10:00.873 --> 01:10:01.893]  Fourteen nations.
[01:10:02.313 --> 01:10:06.136]  Fourteen nations to take on American gun owners.
[01:10:06.256 --> 01:10:10.259]  I saw it with my own eyes and we have, like, we have hours of video of this.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.822]  Of the guys working together and doing these drills.
[01:10:14.402 --> 01:10:25.531]  I need you, I know you're working on going through all the chemtrail videos, the hundreds we've been sent that are incredible from all over the world, but I need you to race and just get that stuff so in the next few days, maybe on Saturday, I know you haven't seen your family,
[01:10:26.131 --> 01:10:26.772]  I guess we can wait.
[01:10:26.792 --> 01:10:27.832]  We just don't have the personnel.
[01:10:28.152 --> 01:10:30.053]  That's why your financial support is so important.
[01:10:30.073 --> 01:10:32.755]  If I had the money, I'd have a few more editors, a few more camera guys.
[01:10:32.975 --> 01:10:34.055]  We're limited, folks.
[01:10:34.376 --> 01:10:35.997]  Like, people are hopping mad.
[01:10:36.077 --> 01:10:36.597]  Some of them are.
[01:10:36.797 --> 01:10:37.777]  They want us to go to the Gulf.
[01:10:38.078 --> 01:10:40.779]  Yeah, that's what I... But I don't have the people!
[01:10:40.879 --> 01:10:41.159]  I know.
[01:10:41.219 --> 01:10:43.521]  I mean, am I supposed to give orders to armies that don't exist?
[01:10:44.381 --> 01:10:48.783]  It's like I'm Hitler or something in my bunker giving orders to armies that only exist on maps.
[01:10:48.883 --> 01:10:51.924]  I mean, it's not going on here.
[01:10:52.384 --> 01:10:53.324]  It's pretty crazy.
[01:10:53.445 --> 01:11:02.168]  Another thing that happened, I was filming at the Sears Tower and they're doing road work underneath, there's these road systems that go underneath the main roads, the street level roads.
[01:11:02.907 --> 01:11:04.029]  And they were all closed off.
[01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:05.170]  I said, well, that's interesting.
[01:11:05.211 --> 01:11:06.833]  I'm going to go down there and start filming that.
[01:11:06.993 --> 01:11:11.199]  And I'm shooting, and all of a sudden a guy in a suit appears and said, sir, sir, what are you doing down here?
[01:11:11.219 --> 01:11:12.942]  I said, I'm just, you know, shooting video.
[01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:14.444]  He goes, no, you can't be down here.
[01:11:14.504 --> 01:11:15.245]  You can't be down here.
[01:11:15.426 --> 01:11:16.347]  So what are y'all doing down here?
[01:11:16.407 --> 01:11:18.049]  He goes, oh, it's all roadwork construction.
[01:11:18.715 --> 01:11:21.817]  But it's all underneath, you know, where the Sears, it's now called the Willis Tower.
[01:11:22.238 --> 01:11:26.481]  And that's another little bit that was just a little side thing that happened.
[01:11:26.641 --> 01:11:28.242]  Oh, it's total mafia takeover.
[01:11:28.482 --> 01:11:32.084]  Listen, get the guys to set you up for at least 30 minutes on the show tomorrow.
[01:11:32.105 --> 01:11:32.385]  All right?
[01:11:32.465 --> 01:11:32.665]  All right.
[01:11:32.905 --> 01:11:33.265]  Good job.
[01:11:33.305 --> 01:11:33.666]  I'll see you.
[01:11:33.686 --> 01:11:33.866]  All right.
[01:11:34.986 --> 01:11:40.052]  Okay, I apologize to Lindsey Williams for digressing with that, but this is the type of insanity we deal with every day.
[01:11:40.593 --> 01:11:47.161]  Now, speaking of funding ourselves, I've done three hours and eleven minutes and haven't even plugged our sponsors yet that made the show possible.
[01:11:47.361 --> 01:11:48.282]  So I'm going to do that right now.
[01:11:48.643 --> 01:11:50.645]  Then we're going back to Lindsey Williams and then your phone calls.
[01:11:51.046 --> 01:11:51.987]  My Solar Backup
[01:11:52.407 --> 01:11:55.191]  Have you lost power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[01:11:55.251 --> 01:12:01.620]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electricity.
[01:12:02.101 --> 01:12:02.661]  Here's why.
[01:12:02.781 --> 01:12:06.787]  Plug and play solar generators are available from our wonderful sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[01:12:07.648 --> 01:12:09.750]  The website, again, is mysolarbackup.com.
[01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:13.593]  Unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly and emits no fumes.
[01:12:13.973 --> 01:12:18.537]  It's like having your own electrical power plant, and it's perfect for your home or your campsite.
[01:12:18.778 --> 01:12:29.847]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or you're worried about the Depression or World War III or all the craziness the Feds are setting up, go to mysolarbackup.com or get a free brochure information package by calling 877-327-0365.
[01:12:29.867 --> 01:12:29.987]  That's 877.
[01:12:34.090 --> 01:12:34.331]  327-0365.
[01:12:35.531 --> 01:12:36.712]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:38.814]  And one other great sponsor I want to tell you about.
[01:12:38.834 --> 01:12:44.557]  In fact, I don't want Will to run with it, but will you get in and bring me the Conan sword made in Spain?
[01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:46.279]  Because this is the type of stuff.
[01:12:46.299 --> 01:12:48.580]  They've got movie replica swords that are actual swords.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:53.383]  They've got cavalry swords that are an excellent weapon, especially in cities where the Second Amendment's banned.
[01:12:54.264 --> 01:12:58.667]  They have tasers, stun guns, mace at the best prices, and best of all, they're Patriots.

[01:13:02.269 --> 01:13:02.790]  Thank you, sir.
[01:13:03.763 --> 01:13:05.444]  I don't even like having this thing around the office, though.
[01:13:05.464 --> 01:13:06.205]  It fell over it.
[01:13:06.265 --> 01:13:07.065]  I mean, this sucker is.
[01:13:07.085 --> 01:13:08.326]  We need to polish it a bit, though.
[01:13:08.746 --> 01:13:09.567]  Made in Spain.
[01:13:09.587 --> 01:13:11.868]  I mean, this is not one of those cheesy, cheap things.
[01:13:12.349 --> 01:13:16.091]  This is the type of stuff they have at weapons-universe.com.
[01:13:16.151 --> 01:13:16.952]  Here you go, buddy.
[01:13:17.592 --> 01:13:19.514]  Take that monstrosity out of here, please.
[01:13:20.874 --> 01:13:23.116]  I tell ya, they got some amazing stuff.
[01:13:23.576 --> 01:13:27.579]  They've got a lot of practical stuff as well at weapons-universe.com.
[01:13:28.079 --> 01:13:28.720]  They have it all.
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.662]  The best names, the widest selection, weapons-universe.com.
[01:13:32.982 --> 01:13:33.283]  Okay.
[01:13:34.232 --> 01:13:36.033]  I'm going to start taking calls at the bottom of the hour.
[01:13:36.053 --> 01:13:52.142]  I'm going to go to Lindsey Williams now to recap what his major oil company executive intel, who we know the source, this is real intel, it's been very accurate predictions in the past, what he told him about the oil spill two weeks ago and the new developments since then.
[01:13:52.562 --> 01:13:54.003]  Lindsey Williams, go ahead sir.
[01:13:54.946 --> 01:14:09.918]  The Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, the real story of what happened out there, what comes out of the Gulf of Mexico oil gusher, with the oil, this is causing the death of humans and unborn babies.
[01:14:10.518 --> 01:14:16.643]  Yes, I'm concerned about the ecology, I sure am, but I am more concerned about what it's doing to human beings.
[01:14:17.429 --> 01:14:19.270]  Now, let me give a very brief background.
[01:14:19.971 --> 01:14:25.354]  In 1970, the Russians drilled the first, what is known as, super-deep oil well.
[01:14:25.994 --> 01:14:29.036]  They drilled it down to 40,230 feet.
[01:14:29.436 --> 01:14:31.177]  It was called Coal SG-3.
[01:14:31.797 --> 01:14:41.223]  Since then, because of what they found, Russian oil majors Kukos has drilled 310 successful deep wells and put them in production.
[01:14:41.283 --> 01:14:42.564]  And last year, Russia
[01:14:43.164 --> 01:14:51.773]  Overtook Saudi Arabia as the world's biggest single oil producer and is now set to be the producer for the next century.
[01:14:51.813 --> 01:14:54.136]  What did they find when they got to 40,230 feet?
[01:14:54.176 --> 01:14:58.180]  They did not find fossil fuel.
[01:14:58.581 --> 01:15:02.305]  There are no rotted trees and plants and animals down that deep.
[01:15:02.785 --> 01:15:05.307]  They found A-Biotic Oil.
[01:15:05.407 --> 01:15:06.568]  Please write this down.
[01:15:07.009 --> 01:15:09.391]  A-B-I-O-T-I-C Oil.
[01:15:09.791 --> 01:15:14.896]  This is oil that has been formed by a chemical process somewhere in the heart of the Earth.
[01:15:15.736 --> 01:15:20.660]  And as a result of this, Russia has become the oil producer they are.
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:29.288]  Now, this oil is seeping up into shallow oil wells, such as Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Mexico,
[01:15:30.285 --> 01:15:33.146]  Many in America, peak oil is a total misnomer.
[01:15:33.666 --> 01:15:49.512]  Now, Russia had sense enough, and I don't hesitate using these words, Russia had sense enough to drill their coal SG3 well down to 40,000 feet, on the land, not in the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:15:50.308 --> 01:15:57.802]  At this point, I contacted the Mr. X in my book, The Energy Non-Crisis, and found out the real story, what has happened.
[01:15:57.822 --> 01:16:00.367]  The difference was BP.
[01:16:01.269 --> 01:16:08.892]  Has attempted to do in the Gulf of Mexico in water, ocean water, what Russia did on the land.
[01:16:08.912 --> 01:16:14.874]  BP was so stupid as to attempt to drill a super deep well.
[01:16:15.114 --> 01:16:18.495]  First time it's ever been done besides anybody but Russia.
[01:16:18.995 --> 01:16:27.058]  And they attempted to drill a super deep well off of a floating platform that was not anchored to the bottom of the ocean.
[01:16:27.778 --> 01:16:33.624]  And it was controlled, its position, by very sophisticated GPS equipment.
[01:16:34.004 --> 01:16:39.189]  Now the water at that point, where they attempted to drill, is 5,000 feet deep.
[01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:41.211]  That's approximately one mile.
[01:16:41.231 --> 01:16:42.373]  5,280 feet, one mile.
[01:16:42.393 --> 01:16:42.933]  They drilled 5,000 feet.
[01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:45.375]  It was 5,000 feet to the bottom of the ocean.
[01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:57.039]  And they drilled from that point between 25 and 30,000 feet deep into the ocean.
[01:16:57.299 --> 01:16:58.240]  Now think of it for a moment.
[01:16:58.541 --> 01:17:03.086]  You're flying on that jet aircraft, commercial airliner, cross-country.
[01:17:03.567 --> 01:17:07.953]  You look out the window and the pilot says, we have reached cruising altitude.
[01:17:08.693 --> 01:17:09.715]  And what do you see?
[01:17:09.735 --> 01:17:11.537]  You can hardly see the ground.
[01:17:11.797 --> 01:17:13.800]  Do you realize that's 30,000 feet?
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:24.593]  And that's exactly where drilled, they had drilled, they had drilled to approximately the depth of what you see from that jet aircraft as you're traveling on a commercial airliner.
[01:17:24.913 --> 01:17:26.234]  It's preposterous.
[01:17:26.254 --> 01:17:41.609]  Now, I've got to stop here long enough, Alex, to say the government of the United States of America issued the permits to BP to drill that well, and I have not made this statement on any program before, I don't think, but I've come to this conclusion.
[01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:48.856]  The government of the United States of America is just as much to blame for this Gulf of Mexico oil disaster as BP.
[01:17:49.697 --> 01:17:50.797]  They issued the permits.
[01:17:51.157 --> 01:17:53.238]  They gave them the permission to do it.
[01:17:53.598 --> 01:17:54.858]  They knew where they were going.
[01:17:55.218 --> 01:17:56.738]  They knew how deep they were going.
[01:17:57.058 --> 01:18:01.159]  They knew that they could not possibly know what they were going to hit down there.
[01:18:01.759 --> 01:18:07.140]  And when BP got down 25,000 to 30,000 feet, let me give you the size of the pipe.
[01:18:08.221 --> 01:18:10.301]  You need to know these details as we go along.
[01:18:10.841 --> 01:18:15.362]  This pipe that they were putting into the ocean floor is 20 inches in diameter.
[01:18:16.082 --> 01:18:20.988]  It is two inches thick of solid hardened steel.
[01:18:21.408 --> 01:18:23.591]  In a moment, I'll tell you what's happening to that pipe.
[01:18:23.951 --> 01:18:26.054]  But right now, let me go back to where we were.
[01:18:26.074 --> 01:18:28.777]  They hit a strata.
[01:18:29.157 --> 01:18:32.461]  They hit something so catastrophic, so unexpected.
[01:18:32.481 --> 01:18:35.865]  This is positively is an accident, folks.
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:41.582]  Don't for one minute's time say that they did this intentionally.
[01:18:41.622 --> 01:18:42.322]  They did not.
[01:18:42.783 --> 01:18:52.447]  Every one of my oil sources, including the individual whom I've been able to contact with Halliburton, every one of them said this happened by accident.
[01:18:52.787 --> 01:18:54.368]  They did not know what they were hitting.
[01:18:54.388 --> 01:18:56.369]  This is not a conspiracy.
[01:18:56.689 --> 01:18:59.791]  This positively is something that they didn't know they were going to hit.
[01:18:59.811 --> 01:19:01.391]  They hit a strata of oil.
[01:19:01.411 --> 01:19:02.632]  Now notice that word strata.
[01:19:03.132 --> 01:19:05.835]  You're going to hear more of it even in the news as they come out with this.
[01:19:06.395 --> 01:19:13.202]  They hit a straddle of oil that was such high pressure that it burst every safety valve they had.
[01:19:13.622 --> 01:19:19.888]  The pressure behind that oil is so high that it destroyed the maximum effort of human science to contain it.
[01:19:20.829 --> 01:19:22.571]  And let's compare it.
[01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:24.671]  Well, Lindsey, let's stop there.
[01:19:25.171 --> 01:19:25.991]  We've got to go to break.
[01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:27.652]  We're going to come right back to you to continue.
[01:19:27.932 --> 01:19:31.874]  So you're basically recapped what you covered a week ago with us, a week and a half ago.
[01:19:31.914 --> 01:19:37.677]  We're going to continue now with the new developments with Lindsey Williams and then your phone calls.
[01:19:38.057 --> 01:19:40.919]  This just breaking at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:19:41.359 --> 01:19:43.040]  It's also up on Infowars.com.
[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:49.243]  Paul Joseph Watson, BP aware of cracks in oil well two months before explosion.
[01:19:50.163 --> 01:19:58.504]  BP was aware of cracks appearing in the well as far back as February, right around the time Goldman Sachs' BP chairman dumped their stock.
[01:20:00.505 --> 01:20:01.825]  Don't answer it!

[01:20:59.414 --> 01:20:59.794]  Good day.
[01:20:59.995 --> 01:21:01.416]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:21:01.716 --> 01:21:01.937]  June 17, 2010.
[01:21:01.997 --> 01:21:03.058]  Gold opened this morning at $1238.40.
[01:21:03.098 --> 01:21:06.101]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1271.33, $635.66 for a half-ounce, or $317.83 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:21:06.141 --> 01:21:06.581]  That's $1271.33, $635.66, or $317.83.
[01:21:19.068 --> 01:21:21.709]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[01:21:21.929 --> 01:21:25.850]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[01:21:26.210 --> 01:21:30.812]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:21:31.092 --> 01:21:34.573]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold.

[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:52.640]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:59.642 --> 01:22:01.964]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:22:02.044 --> 01:22:04.247]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:22:04.347 --> 01:22:07.189]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:22:07.570 --> 01:22:12.334]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:22:12.675 --> 01:22:16.879]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:22:17.179 --> 01:22:19.501]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:22:19.521 --> 01:22:22.042]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:24.984]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:22:25.324 --> 01:22:32.929]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:22:33.269 --> 01:22:38.492]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:22:38.652 --> 01:22:40.933]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:22:41.513 --> 01:22:44.935]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:22:45.195 --> 01:22:46.115]  And I got news for you.
[01:22:46.275 --> 01:22:47.576]  You're everyone else.
[01:22:47.596 --> 01:22:48.617]  Invisible Empire.

[01:22:59.821 --> 01:23:03.022]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:04.143]  Think again!
[01:23:04.903 --> 01:23:12.385]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[01:23:12.546 --> 01:23:19.508]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[01:23:19.768 --> 01:23:27.991]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf cleanup.
[01:23:28.331 --> 01:23:29.232]  Do what NOAA did.
[01:23:29.432 --> 01:23:33.775]  Contact airfiltersandpurifiers.com and ask about the Health Mate Plus.

[01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:06.703]  They don't want to see us tonight.
[01:24:06.823 --> 01:24:09.367]  Or they want us to do this.
[01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:21.311]  Well, I talked to Lindsey during the break, and he said this is the number one issue, and I agree.
[01:24:21.351 --> 01:24:28.555]  This is all I hear my neighbors talking about, people on other talk radio shows talking about, and it's like, what is the government going to do?
[01:24:28.655 --> 01:24:29.636]  What is the government going to do?
[01:24:29.776 --> 01:24:37.260]  And their idea is carbon taxes, gas taxes that will fully destroy our economy.
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:52.208]  And still the oil well leaks and leaks and leaks, and BP's been caught lying from the beginning, now into day 67, and this is decimating the Gulf Coast.
[01:24:52.288 --> 01:24:54.229]  But then I did read the reports that
[01:24:55.049 --> 01:25:03.075]  This oil is full of all sorts of other toxic elements and chemicals and heavy metals, and it is killing dolphins and turtles en masse.
[01:25:03.955 --> 01:25:10.280]  It is just destroying the fishing, the agriculture, the governments and everything it can to block a good response.
[01:25:11.361 --> 01:25:20.988]  Lindsey Williams continuing, you got to the point of the super, you know, high-powered pressure of this well, which they're now admitting, and then you had new developments.
[01:25:23.399 --> 01:25:23.939]  Yes, Alex.
[01:25:23.979 --> 01:25:30.841]  When I was at Pluto Bay as the chaplain to the elite of the world for those three years time, I watched them bring in many oil wells.
[01:25:31.382 --> 01:25:37.143]  The very first thing they would give as soon as a new oil well was brought in, they would give, and please write these words down.
[01:25:37.483 --> 01:25:39.424]  You want to be correct whenever you say things.
[01:25:40.004 --> 01:25:45.166]  Alex, you'll notice that over the years, the only thing I ever give on any show is what I can prove
[01:25:47.948 --> 01:25:48.808]  I think so.
[01:25:48.888 --> 01:25:49.408]  I hope so.
[01:25:49.468 --> 01:25:50.649]  Or possibly could be.
[01:25:51.009 --> 01:25:51.930]  I'll stay away from it.
[01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:54.552]  The first thing they would give is the flow rate.
[01:25:55.072 --> 01:25:58.734]  They would check how much oil is coming out of that well.
[01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:01.176]  How many barrels for a period of time.
[01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:06.019]  Second thing they would always give, and you have never heard this about the Gulf of Mexico,
[01:26:06.699 --> 01:26:10.060]  They always gave the pressure at the wellhead.
[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:11.760]  Please write down the words wellhead.
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.160]  That's at the top of the pipe.
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:14.760]  They would take the pressure.
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:23.182]  Now, the pressure at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska on the average well was 1,500 pounds per square inch, PSI.
[01:26:23.802 --> 01:26:27.583]  The automobile tire on your automobile has 35 pounds per square inch.
[01:26:27.923 --> 01:26:31.584]  Your truck tire on a big tandem tractor-trailer will weigh 100 pounds.
[01:26:31.864 --> 01:26:32.364]  Are you ready?
[01:26:32.744 --> 01:26:33.664]  Please write this down.
[01:26:34.424 --> 01:26:47.734]  From my sources, they say that the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, BP's well, hit a pressure that human beings have never experienced before on any well they've ever driven.
[01:26:49.956 --> 01:26:50.957]  Russia never hit this.
[01:26:51.397 --> 01:26:53.539]  They hit pressures, but not this kind of pressure.
[01:26:53.939 --> 01:26:57.462]  BP actually hit 20,000 to 70,000 pounds per square inch.
[01:27:01.525 --> 01:27:05.387]  This is beyond human technology to contain it.
[01:27:05.807 --> 01:27:06.727]  It blew everything.
[01:27:06.747 --> 01:27:08.428]  It blew the safety valves.
[01:27:08.868 --> 01:27:10.449]  It blew holes in the pipe.
[01:27:10.829 --> 01:27:11.409]  Oh, please.
[01:27:11.710 --> 01:27:13.010]  You've got... This is a new one.
[01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:15.971]  I'll intersperse these as we go along.
[01:27:16.392 --> 01:27:24.055]  You remember a moment ago, I told you that that pipe that they drilled in the bottom of the ocean was 2 inches thick and 20 inches in diameter.
[01:27:24.475 --> 01:27:26.236]  Solid, hardened steel.
[01:27:27.316 --> 01:27:31.020]  That pipe right now is no longer two inches thick.
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:33.262]  It is one inch thick.
[01:27:33.522 --> 01:27:34.383]  Let me explain.
[01:27:34.403 --> 01:27:50.360]  You remember that BP, back about two, three weeks ago, closed down the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline because for 35 years they've been running oil through it and it has so diminished the thickness of the pipe that they were getting leaks everywhere.
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:52.661]  This happens over a period of time.
[01:27:53.081 --> 01:28:06.669]  Because of the extreme pressure and the abrasive substances that are coming out of this pipe in the Gulf of Mexico, the thickness of the wall of that pipe is no longer two inches.
[01:28:07.049 --> 01:28:09.731]  It is all the way down to one inch now.
[01:28:10.191 --> 01:28:19.376]  And by the time they can plant a nuclear device, an angle drill, and put it in three to four months from now, they say as soon as they could possibly do anything about it,
[01:28:19.856 --> 01:28:29.705]  Meanwhile, there's fissures all over the ocean floor many miles away leaking so there's these fractures and for those that just joined us, BP has now admitted, this is up on PrisonPlanet.com, they were aware of cracks in oil well
[01:28:46.857 --> 01:28:53.481]  Two months before the explosion, and that they were giving orders to people on the well that the engineers said were dangerous.
[01:28:53.542 --> 01:28:55.963]  So, just very reckless by BP.
[01:28:56.824 --> 01:29:04.049]  Now getting into the toxicity, you say you were on a talk show in Florida, and that people were calling in saying they were sick.
[01:29:04.389 --> 01:29:07.051]  We know the workers in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama
[01:29:08.248 --> 01:29:08.929]  ...are very sick.
[01:29:09.330 --> 01:29:11.512]  BP's tried to make them sign waiver forms.
[01:29:11.753 --> 01:29:20.024]  They're not even giving them the proper breathing apparatus they need because of the type of toxic chemicals that are off-gassing out of this oil.
[01:29:22.208 --> 01:29:24.330]  Yes, that was the most dangerous part.
[01:29:24.930 --> 01:29:28.753]  You know, most people think that the only thing that comes out of an oil well is oil.
[01:29:29.513 --> 01:29:31.035]  No, quite to the contrary.
[01:29:31.395 --> 01:29:38.500]  There are many things that come out, and it depends on the field or the strata that they go into as to what will actually come out of that well.
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:41.762]  What is coming out of the well in the Gulf of Mexico?
[01:29:41.802 --> 01:29:43.644]  Now, the oil has kind of a reddish color.
[01:29:43.664 --> 01:29:44.965]  All right, stay there.
[01:29:45.205 --> 01:29:45.925]  Stay there, Lindsey.
[01:29:45.965 --> 01:29:47.647]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:47.687 --> 01:29:49.128]  We'll get into what's coming out of the well.
[01:29:49.929 --> 01:29:52.932]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.854 --> 01:29:56.537]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.441 --> 01:30:06.166]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.

[01:31:03.212 --> 01:31:09.257]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:31:09.617 --> 01:31:16.723]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:31:17.024 --> 01:31:21.608]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:32:00.626 --> 01:32:04.269]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:04.589 --> 01:32:12.715]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:13.456 --> 01:32:17.499]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:18.099 --> 01:32:28.908]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:29.528 --> 01:32:38.552]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:39.052 --> 01:32:44.094]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:44.475 --> 01:32:51.658]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:51.958 --> 01:32:54.719]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:06.343 --> 01:33:12.988]  Alright, I'll be going into overdrive today for at least 20 minutes with Lindsey Williams so we can get into all his new info.
[01:33:13.468 --> 01:33:21.895]  I know in the last 20 minutes I've had him recap what he covered with us last week and now he's going to get into the new developments from his sources.
[01:33:23.168 --> 01:33:27.670]  And I'll also give you my perspective, and we're going to be taking your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:28.131 --> 01:33:30.832]  Mark, Andrew, Alan, Grant, James, and others.
[01:33:31.212 --> 01:33:34.994]  The toll-free number to join us on air, dealing with the oil spill and the aftermath, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:39.136 --> 01:33:44.780]  But I have seen EPA scientists saying in some areas of the Gulf, there is toxic gases.
[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:46.261]  You should move out of the area.
[01:33:46.701 --> 01:33:48.702]  We know they have moved National Guard in.
[01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:51.044]  There's been rumors of evacuation.
[01:33:51.965 --> 01:34:01.771]  But Lindsey Williams, you said you've been talking to Gulf radio shows you've been on, and I've been on a few myself, in Florida, in Mississippi, in Louisiana, in Alabama.
[01:34:02.251 --> 01:34:04.833]  And none of the people are saying they're being told to evacuate.
[01:34:05.774 --> 01:34:08.596]  But we saw what happened with Katrina, where they locked down the city.
[01:34:09.516 --> 01:34:25.103]  Would let people get out and then came for the guns and so the government is capable of anything and My concern is if a hurricane does hit we're only about two months out from that unfortunately Not only will you have the currents taking it out of the Gulf?
[01:34:26.264 --> 01:34:29.906]  Around Florida into the Atlantic and dispersing it into a wider area
[01:34:30.626 --> 01:34:31.067]  I don't know.
[01:34:49.332 --> 01:35:01.444]  Up on the beaches with the chemicals that it's off-gassing and so that could trigger just a disaster of unprecedented proportions here in North America.
[01:35:01.784 --> 01:35:06.608]  They have had similar things happen in the Gulf and different regions around the Middle East.
[01:35:06.829 --> 01:35:08.410]  It's happened in Indonesia.
[01:35:09.731 --> 01:35:13.235]  So they have had other big oil spills, but this one is starting to rival those.
[01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:21.663]  So continue with the toxicity issue, and then any intel you've got on moves for forced evacuations.
[01:35:21.703 --> 01:35:26.468]  Because, you know, I saw these reports two weeks ago, and I called the towns it was supposedly happening in.
[01:35:26.909 --> 01:35:27.790]  I called hotels.
[01:35:27.870 --> 01:35:28.911]  I called 7-Elevens.
[01:35:29.231 --> 01:35:30.612]  People said, no, there's no troops here.
[01:35:31.033 --> 01:35:33.375]  Now, some areas said there's troops here, but there's no evacuation.
[01:35:33.696 --> 01:35:35.658]  So, Lindsey, continue, and then we're going to go to phone calls.
[01:35:36.465 --> 01:35:44.109]  Well Alex, you mentioned a subject a moment ago that I need to briefly touch on so they'll understand the magnitude of this whole thing.
[01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:52.814]  Senator Bill Nelson appeared on, he's a Democrat from Florida, he appeared on MSNBC with Andrea Mitchell.
[01:35:53.554 --> 01:35:58.139]  On the 9th of June, and he said oil is seeping up from the seabed.
[01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:13.395]  Just after that, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been denying that the NBP, both, for all of this time has been denying that there are any leaks coming out at other places in the ocean.
[01:36:13.455 --> 01:36:15.838]  That means plumes of oil coming up.
[01:36:16.218 --> 01:36:24.268]  That somehow escaped from that pipe because unladenly that big pipe was perforated at the time this humongous amount of pressure hit it.
[01:36:24.288 --> 01:36:26.130]  20 to 70 thousand pounds per square inch.
[01:36:26.551 --> 01:36:28.333]  They just admitted to it.
[01:36:28.633 --> 01:36:31.096]  This is by Chris Baltimore from Houston, Texas.
[01:36:31.156 --> 01:36:32.978]  It was on Routers News on June the 8th.
[01:36:33.679 --> 01:36:48.479]  And they said, experts are investigating and report admitting all plumes estimating from the BP's pig-stricken oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, and they say that these plumes are appearing as much as 20 miles away.
[01:36:48.559 --> 01:36:49.441]  Did you catch that?
[01:36:49.901 --> 01:37:01.567]  Folks, do you realize that 25,000 to 30,000 feet down, that big 2-inch thick hardened steel pipe has undoubtedly burst?
[01:37:02.107 --> 01:37:10.331]  And these plumes are working their way out up through the bottom of the ocean, and they now are, for the first time, admitting that they're there.
[01:37:10.631 --> 01:37:16.714]  Even if they stop the pipe itself from flowing, how many plumes do they have out there that they're going to stop, too?
[01:37:16.794 --> 01:37:17.735]  Now, Matt Simmons,
[01:37:18.435 --> 01:37:26.639]  And they may have hit a level where it's abiotic, where it's basically unlimited.
[01:37:26.679 --> 01:37:35.642]  We know many of the old oil wells are now filling back up and more and more petroleum geologists and scientists do believe that it is abiotic being made in the earth.
[01:37:36.022 --> 01:37:44.726]  You can find some small deposits of the oil as we know it that has particulate from animals in it.
[01:37:45.226 --> 01:37:51.707]  You know, dead prehistoric creatures, fossils, coal that has the imprint of ferns in it.
[01:37:52.027 --> 01:37:56.968]  So we know there is some fossil fuel that is based on dead life and swamps.
[01:37:57.769 --> 01:38:03.530]  But more and more the evidence shows that most oil is abiotic, being produced down in the earth.
[01:38:04.050 --> 01:38:12.172]  And what if they've hit a new strata, and this sucker just keeps pumping for years, then we could have a problem which is
[01:38:14.394 --> 01:38:19.684]  Alex, Matt Simmons said just this week 25,000 barrels of oil
[01:38:25.265 --> 01:38:25.745]  I don't know.
[01:38:52.845 --> 01:38:55.446]  All the way down 5 miles, 5,000 feet.
[01:38:55.806 --> 01:39:04.009]  Now, coming up with that oil, the Environmental Protection Agency just gave these statistics the other day.
[01:39:04.049 --> 01:39:05.209]  I'm going to read them to you.
[01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:07.750]  My goodness, they are so startling.
[01:39:08.210 --> 01:39:11.151]  Coming up with the oil are these gases.
[01:39:11.592 --> 01:39:12.512]  They are toxic.
[01:39:12.972 --> 01:39:14.072]  They are flammable.
[01:39:14.452 --> 01:39:15.733]  If we had a hurricane,
[01:39:16.193 --> 01:39:17.254]  Lord have mercy.
[01:39:17.494 --> 01:39:27.522]  I cannot imagine the respiratory problems and the health problems that are going to develop all the way up the East Coast of America as these gases are taken there.
[01:39:27.582 --> 01:39:37.551]  People are already sick in Florida, as I mentioned from the radio show I was on yesterday in Orlando, Florida, where the talk show host himself said, I've been wanting to throw up for three days.
[01:39:38.431 --> 01:39:39.112]  Now, here they are.
[01:39:39.733 --> 01:39:44.796]  The EPA said that hydrogen sulfide is coming out of that well.
[01:39:45.357 --> 01:39:51.841]  Now I'm going to give you what they allow as the allowable limits for a person to breathe and be safe.
[01:39:51.861 --> 01:39:55.943]  5 to 10 parts per billion.
[01:39:56.083 --> 01:39:57.504]  Please write these letters down.
[01:39:57.624 --> 01:40:00.166]  P-T-E as in boy.
[01:40:00.786 --> 01:40:08.810]  The current tested levels of hydrogen sulfide are 1,200 parts per billion.
[01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:10.110]  This is staggering.
[01:40:10.130 --> 01:40:12.972]  And they aren't telling people about this.
[01:40:13.832 --> 01:40:18.274]  The mothers who are carrying babies, unborn, do you know what this is going to do to them?
[01:40:18.754 --> 01:40:22.836]  Can you have the slightest idea of the health effects that are going to develop from this?
[01:40:23.116 --> 01:40:26.378]  The next one is benzene, and this one really frightens me.
[01:40:26.918 --> 01:40:28.101]  Benzene is toxic.
[01:40:28.562 --> 01:40:30.185]  Benzene is a carcinogen.
[01:40:30.565 --> 01:40:32.469]  Benzene causes cancer.
[01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:38.340]  The safe level... Benzene is so dangerous that the Environmental Protection Agency only allows zero.
[01:40:40.043 --> 01:40:40.884]  We're good to go.
[01:40:57.228 --> 01:40:57.868]  Well let me...
[01:41:12.256 --> 01:41:17.240]  Let me give you what the EPA says and what the Associated Press is saying.
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:23.284]  Take precautions to move out of the area if impacted by oil spills, says environmental chemist.
[01:41:23.704 --> 01:41:27.987]  Toxins are at 200 times normal levels along the coast.
[01:41:28.067 --> 01:41:33.451]  Now, Lindsey, I want to get into the new info before we go to these calls, because we've got a bunch of calls we've got to get to.
[01:41:34.152 --> 01:41:39.736]  Give us any of the new intel or anything else your source told you or anything else you want to discuss.
[01:41:40.851 --> 01:41:44.692]  Well, first of all, this radio show that I was just on yesterday, unbelievable.
[01:41:44.712 --> 01:41:54.853]  The pipe in the Gulf of Mexico, I think, is very significant in that it has eroded already one inch of its thickness because of the abrasives coming out.
[01:41:55.173 --> 01:42:02.595]  And there will be no pipe there as of three to four months from now, whatever they say, they could plant a nuclear device.
[01:42:03.115 --> 01:42:10.376]  And with all of these other gushers that are coming out at distances up to 20 miles, Alex, I think we have got a
[01:42:10.996 --> 01:42:14.298]  Well, I'm sure Obama will give us a carbon tax that we pay Al Gore that will fix it.
[01:42:14.738 --> 01:42:18.000]  What do you think of Obama pushing a carbon tax as the supposed solution?
[01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:48.178]  Well, I have been told by some very reliable sources, you know, I have some of them, that the elite positively will use this disaster, even though it's an accident.
[01:42:48.758 --> 01:42:52.501]  They will use it to accomplish their 2010 timeline.
[01:42:52.561 --> 01:42:57.024]  People, please, please, I beg of you, get my documentary.
[01:42:57.404 --> 01:42:59.185]  We just prepared it a few days ago.
[01:42:59.385 --> 01:43:00.726]  Would you please call this number?
[01:43:01.207 --> 01:43:01.767]  The number is 888.
[01:43:03.699 --> 01:43:11.847]  799-6111 or go on the web to prophecyclub.com.
[01:43:11.887 --> 01:43:16.851]  P-R-O-P-H-E-C-Y-C-L-U-B dot com.
[01:43:17.031 --> 01:43:19.954]  Our toll free number where the operator is standing by right now, 888-799-6111.
[01:43:25.195 --> 01:43:34.425]  6111, the entire story of what the elite plan to do with this, a documentary I just prepared with everything I'm giving here, even the other night on Coast to Coast.
[01:43:35.707 --> 01:43:36.648]  I had two hours.
[01:43:36.668 --> 01:43:39.111]  I only covered maybe half of my materials.
[01:43:39.591 --> 01:43:41.091]  I know, I understand.
[01:43:41.312 --> 01:43:48.833]  There's a lot of info and we're going to give people that phone number and website again one more time.
[01:43:48.873 --> 01:44:05.678]  But specifically though, from all of your sources and the radio interviews you're doing, because you told me during a break, Lindsey, the good news is you have not seen any proof that the military is preparing for a forced evacuation of tens of millions of people on the Gulf Coast.
[01:44:06.468 --> 01:44:12.073]  I've talked with a number of people in Florida and Gulf Coast and I've asked every one of them the same question.
[01:44:12.374 --> 01:44:14.876]  Do you see any evidence of a forced evacuation?
[01:44:15.216 --> 01:44:21.342]  The talk show host on yesterday along with the callers and there were an entire hour of full lines.
[01:44:21.763 --> 01:44:29.350]  Every single one of them said we have seen no evidence whatsoever so far or even heard any evidence of a forced evacuation.
[01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:32.072]  Okay, listen, we're going to go 20 minutes of overdrive.
[01:44:32.612 --> 01:44:38.636]  It'll be at Infowars.com on the audio streams and for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, it won't be on the AM and FM.
[01:44:38.897 --> 01:44:42.739]  We've only got about 15 minutes left, right before the show officially ends in 15 minutes.
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:46.962]  We'll give out that number and website one more time, but speaking of callers, let's get to them.
[01:44:47.323 --> 01:44:49.024]  Mark in Texas, thanks for holding.
[01:44:49.304 --> 01:44:50.605]  You're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[01:44:50.645 --> 01:44:51.025]  Go ahead.
[01:44:51.926 --> 01:44:52.526]  Hey, thank you.
[01:44:53.407 --> 01:44:55.929]  A couple questions and then I wanted to
[01:44:56.613 --> 01:45:07.807]  See, if the people or Lindsey had heard you speak of, Alex, with your son talking about himself reading the Bible, how that might be a help to other people, get a hold of some things and how they deal with stuff.
[01:45:08.544 --> 01:45:12.387]  And that Hebrews 9 seemed to be a key to understanding the rest of the Bible.
[01:45:12.748 --> 01:45:20.013]  I read recently, like a family member who dies and he being crucified, I don't think he'd leave without leaving us some detailed instructions.
[01:45:20.994 --> 01:45:24.977]  Now I know you Mark, and I appreciate your call, but we just got questions for Lindsey Williams here.
[01:45:25.658 --> 01:45:26.959]  Andrew in Ohio.
[01:45:27.379 --> 01:45:28.801]  Andrew, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:45:29.601 --> 01:45:31.463]  Hi Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[01:45:32.944 --> 01:45:36.387]  I've been researching this for several weeks now.
[01:45:37.182 --> 01:45:44.047]  And the Blackstone Group owns the company that makes CoreXit, which is far, far more toxic.
[01:45:44.627 --> 01:45:50.871]  It's a dispersant that they are putting like a million gallons or so, mixing it with the oil.
[01:45:51.692 --> 01:45:59.597]  And they may say that these toxic chemicals are coming out of the well, but they're the ones that are adding it to the gulf.
[01:46:00.647 --> 01:46:02.469]  Well, you know, that's a good point.
[01:46:02.569 --> 01:46:06.553]  Normally we don't see people getting this sick from an oil spill.
[01:46:06.573 --> 01:46:12.960]  There's different variants of crude oil, so it varies from type to type, strata to strata, region to region.
[01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:21.568]  But they are pumping all these admittedly deadly poison dispersants in, so it's a case of the cure being worse than disease.
[01:46:21.608 --> 01:46:21.989]  Go ahead.
[01:46:22.728 --> 01:46:25.890]  Yes, Alex, let me answer his question about CoriExit.
[01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:30.713]  Last week on your program, I had so much material, I never even got to this subject.
[01:46:30.773 --> 01:46:32.654]  I'm so glad that Carla called in about it.
[01:46:32.714 --> 01:46:46.162]  Scientists believe that BP is dumping millions of gallons of CoriExit 9500, a chemical dispersion agent, under the Gulf of Mexico waters to hide the full extent of the leak.
[01:46:46.702 --> 01:46:49.284]  Now estimated to be 2.9 gallons a day.
[01:46:49.304 --> 01:46:53.348]  Well, as you know what, uh, Matt Simmons said 20, uh, much more than that.
[01:46:53.468 --> 01:46:53.708]  All right.
[01:46:56.172 --> 01:47:01.436]  9,500 is a solvent three times more toxic than oil.
[01:47:01.856 --> 01:47:14.965]  The ancient scientists believe has a 2.61 ppm toxicity level and when mixed with the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, its molecules will be able to phase transition.
[01:47:15.365 --> 01:47:19.208]  The transition involves the change of a liquid into a gaseous state
[01:47:19.668 --> 01:47:19.948]  I think?
[01:47:38.413 --> 01:47:48.339]  And then that'll cause red tides, and that's why they're reporting these big giant toxic plumes under the surface as well, not just coming out of the other fissures.
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:57.505]  So we'll continue to analyze this, but just remember, they're gearing up for war with Iran while we're talking about this, and the bankers are setting up their world government right now.
[01:47:58.246 --> 01:48:00.487]  Boy, this is very convenient timing for them.
[01:48:00.627 --> 01:48:05.010]  Keep in mind that my informant, now three 87-year-old gentlemen,
[01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:10.052]  Tell me a year and a half ago that they did not want war with Iran for two years.
[01:48:10.433 --> 01:48:11.633]  That was a year and a half ago.
[01:48:11.933 --> 01:48:15.335]  Alex, we've only got six months, and they have war planned.
[01:48:15.655 --> 01:48:28.001]  You are going to see this escalate now, and they will use this Gulf of Mexico disaster to fit into all of their other plans in order to fulfill their 2012 timeline.
[01:48:28.381 --> 01:48:32.283]  Alright, well, that's what it looks like, what it's shaping up for.
[01:48:32.903 --> 01:48:33.904]  Anything else, Andrew?
[01:48:35.247 --> 01:48:35.447]  Sure.
[01:48:37.070 --> 01:48:43.199]  It is possible to plug the oil well by putting a pig down the shaft.
[01:48:44.122 --> 01:48:49.286]  And using thermite to weld the plug at the deep, farthest end.
[01:48:49.686 --> 01:49:11.542]  Yeah, but how do you put a pig, and for those that don't know, that's one of these little robot systems, how do you have it go into a crushed wellhead and when it's got all that pressure coming out of it, but yes, they could run a robot up in it and then have it seal it, but how do you do that when you've got all this oil and chemicals gushing around it?
[01:49:11.582 --> 01:49:12.203]  Lindsey Williams.
[01:49:12.901 --> 01:49:14.963]  Well, the pipe is already perforated.
[01:49:15.363 --> 01:49:23.750]  They know because of these plumes that are coming up as much as 20 miles away, which the, you know, AA now is admitting to, and they wouldn't admit to before.
[01:49:24.171 --> 01:49:31.757]  There's no way you can stop this because all you do is just open up that pipe even further down the line somewhere and you still get the plumes out at a distance.
[01:49:32.178 --> 01:49:33.679]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[01:49:33.699 --> 01:49:34.500]  Anything else, Andrew?
[01:49:36.462 --> 01:49:38.703]  All right, I want to hear more about that system.
[01:49:39.023 --> 01:49:51.490]  By the way, this is up on PrisonPlanet.com right now, and of course that deals with the fact that the head of BP actually had the article here in front of me.
[01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:54.352]  Let me pull it back up because I can't find it now.
[01:49:55.573 --> 01:49:56.093]  Oh, here it is.
[01:49:56.493 --> 01:50:01.156]  BP aware of cracks in oil well two months before explosion.
[01:50:02.469 --> 01:50:08.293]  Former BP Chairman and current BP CEO both dumped stocks in weeks before a disaster.
[01:50:08.333 --> 01:50:12.295]  BP was aware of cracks appearing in the well as far back as February.
[01:50:12.376 --> 01:50:22.102]  Right around the time, Goldman Sachs and BP Chairman Tony Hayward were busy dumping their stock in the company on the eve of the explosion that led to the oil spill, according to information uncovered by congressional investigators.
[01:50:22.722 --> 01:50:30.548]  The Mining and Mineral Service Agency released documents to Bloomberg indicating that BP was trying to seal cracks in the well almost 40
[01:50:31.368 --> 01:50:33.789]  Miles, 64 kilometers off the Louisiana coast.
[01:50:33.809 --> 01:50:36.529]  This is big news up on PresidentPlanet.com.
[01:50:36.549 --> 01:50:37.270]  This is confirmed.
[01:50:37.290 --> 01:50:37.690]  Bloomberg.
[01:50:38.250 --> 01:50:48.613]  The fissures, which BP began to attempt to fix on February 13th, could have played a role in the disaster, though this is a question still being explored by investigators.
[01:50:48.633 --> 01:50:50.373]  But that would show where the plumes are coming from.
[01:50:51.313 --> 01:50:52.294]  And it just continues.
[01:50:52.334 --> 01:50:53.594]  Very important piece of intel.

[01:52:04.341 --> 01:52:05.302]  Tyranny is here.
[01:52:05.602 --> 01:52:09.224]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:52:09.244 --> 01:52:11.766]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:52:11.786 --> 01:52:17.229]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:52:17.649 --> 01:52:23.873]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:52:24.313 --> 01:52:29.856]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[01:52:44.705 --> 01:52:47.587]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:52:48.247 --> 01:52:49.648]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:52:50.208 --> 01:52:50.708]  It's here.

[01:53:04.075 --> 01:53:04.396]  Fact.
[01:53:04.596 --> 01:53:07.957]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[01:53:08.278 --> 01:53:08.598]  Fact.
[01:53:08.898 --> 01:53:14.201]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.

[01:54:12.941 --> 01:54:13.343]  Folks!
[01:54:18.325 --> 01:54:26.867]  The only way to listen to the show when it officially ends in about five minutes, we're going to continue for about 20, is at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:26.887 --> 01:54:29.428]  You go there, click on the listen stream, you'll be able to hear the show.
[01:54:29.968 --> 01:54:33.789]  We'll also have this as part of the MP3 free podcast.
[01:54:33.809 --> 01:54:43.291]  You can also go download for free our iPhone app to listen to the podcast or the live streams at InfoWars.com on the listen page.
[01:54:43.771 --> 01:54:47.352]  And I know we have loaded phones and we are taking calls in the next 20 minutes.
[01:54:48.332 --> 01:55:01.164]  With Lindsey Williams, I'm going to be able to go to a few of your calls now, but I want to give you an opportunity to call my phone system here in Austin, Texas, 888-201-2244.
[01:55:01.864 --> 01:55:08.831]  For those that are on hold right now, who we don't have time to get to in a moment, it'll be 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[01:55:10.812 --> 01:55:13.014]  We're talking to Lindsey Williams, and he put out an emergency
[01:55:14.075 --> 01:55:32.857]  uh... cd audio cd with all the information uh... that uh... his source inside the oil companies uh... gave him but so much of what lindsey's talked about has now been borne out in mainstream news and it clearly the oil companies uh... you know bp and haliburton involved are involved in a cover-up
[01:55:33.698 --> 01:55:35.039]  This is very, very serious.
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:41.284]  And Obama's using it to try to pass carbon taxes on the American people, which BP's been the biggest supporter of.
[01:55:42.185 --> 01:55:46.188]  So I want to encourage everybody to call and get that audio CD.
[01:55:46.548 --> 01:55:50.592]  And you can go to the Prophecy Club website or call a toll-free number.
[01:55:51.012 --> 01:55:55.316]  Give folks that contact info again, Mr. Williams.
[01:55:56.136 --> 01:56:08.999]  The toll-free number and the operator standing by right now, American Voices by the way, 888-799-6111, or go to Prophecy Club on the internet, be sure and spell that with a C, P-R-O-P-H-E-C-Y-C-L-U-B dot com, or 888-799-6111.
[01:56:17.841 --> 01:56:18.521]  7-9-9-6-1-1-1.
[01:56:18.781 --> 01:56:25.624]  Now, we will be updating this documentary probably every two weeks.
[01:56:25.684 --> 01:56:27.265]  Things are happening so rapidly.
[01:56:27.665 --> 01:56:34.148]  And please, I beg of you, my DVDs and CDs are not copywritten, did you hear that?
[01:56:34.188 --> 01:56:35.289]  Yeah, we gotta get them out to folks.
[01:56:35.449 --> 01:56:37.850]  Well, Lindsey, we're almost out of time.
[01:56:37.970 --> 01:56:39.311]  We're almost out of time here right at the end.
[01:56:39.331 --> 01:56:40.471]  I want to jam in some more calls.
[01:56:41.131 --> 01:56:42.892]  Let's talk to Grant and P.A.
[01:56:43.172 --> 01:56:43.793]  You're on the air.
[01:56:43.833 --> 01:56:44.493]  Go ahead, Grant.
[01:56:45.738 --> 01:56:46.278]  Uh, hi Alex.
[01:56:46.578 --> 01:57:03.747]  I would like to, uh, I have a question for Lindsey Williams and, uh, I'd like to say that I choose not to believe that 9-11 was not an inside job just because our government says so because it scientifically doesn't seem to make sense that the buildings could have fallen that fast just by being hit by the planes alone.
[01:57:04.407 --> 01:57:14.011]  I also choose not to believe that anyone has ever walked on water or come back to life after being dead for three days because scientifically that's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:57:14.131 --> 01:57:15.372]  I'd also like to add to that that
[01:57:15.931 --> 01:57:22.396]  I used to be a Christian myself and I would recommend everyone listen to this.
[01:57:22.536 --> 01:57:24.358]  I'm going to put you on hold here.
[01:57:25.259 --> 01:57:27.560]  Look, I mean I only do this maybe once or twice a week.
[01:57:27.941 --> 01:57:36.588]  We have a guest on and I say I want to be on topic if you have questions for the guest and then people deliberately, deliberately
[01:57:38.379 --> 01:57:40.881]  Talk about anything but that.
[01:57:41.001 --> 01:57:41.941]  And I don't understand it.
[01:57:42.281 --> 01:57:44.383]  So I'm gonna, from now on, I'll let people go.
[01:57:44.783 --> 01:57:49.846]  When we're on a topic, we're having a discussion on a topic, it's insanity.
[01:57:50.246 --> 01:57:51.467]  And you can get mad at me if you want.
[01:57:51.527 --> 01:57:57.651]  I mean, if you called in, Grant, on a regular day when it's just open phones and wanted to say that, that's fine.
[01:57:57.831 --> 01:57:58.931]  We don't screen your calls.
[01:57:59.011 --> 01:58:01.053]  But, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:58:01.974 --> 01:58:06.395]  That other callers are left on hold, so you can talk about that.
[01:58:07.495 --> 01:58:17.297]  James Hunter and others, if you want to talk to Lindsey Williams and ask him a question, or make a comment about the oil spill, or you're in Louisiana or Mississippi, Florida, you've got comments.
[01:58:17.357 --> 01:58:21.258]  If you're having respiratory problems, we want to hear from you.
[01:58:21.278 --> 01:58:21.898]  888-201-2244.
[01:58:22.018 --> 01:58:23.318]  We're going into extended
[01:58:25.919 --> 01:58:31.862]  InfoWars.com audio stream and PrisonPlanet.tv video stream coverage of the oil spill.
[01:58:31.922 --> 01:58:32.982]  You want it, you got it.
[01:58:33.283 --> 01:58:35.904]  Lindsey Williams with us into overdrive right now.
[01:58:36.204 --> 01:58:37.965]  Got to tune in to InfoWars.com.
[01:58:38.185 --> 01:58:38.865]  Great job, crew.
[01:58:38.905 --> 01:58:39.466]  Back in one minute.
[01:58:39.506 --> 01:58:44.148]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNLive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:58:49.039 --> 01:58:53.263]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:53.583 --> 01:58:53.863]  Number 1.
[01:58:54.504 --> 01:58:57.646]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:57.927 --> 01:58:58.487]  Number 2.
[01:58:58.787 --> 01:59:03.331]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:03.671 --> 01:59:04.132]  It's true.
[01:59:04.432 --> 01:59:08.976]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:09.296 --> 01:59:09.837]  Number 3.
[01:59:10.117 --> 01:59:13.400]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:17.403]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:17.603 --> 01:59:18.164]  Number four.
[01:59:18.404 --> 01:59:20.766]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:21.166 --> 01:59:24.549]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:24.849 --> 01:59:25.389]  Number five.
[01:59:25.629 --> 01:59:29.552]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:29.773 --> 01:59:34.556]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:34.837 --> 01:59:38.860]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:39.020 --> 01:59:40.581]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.801 --> 01:59:45.405]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:59:45.725 --> 01:59:45.945]  877-327-0365.
[01:59:45.985 --> 01:59:50.914]  Coast to Coast.
[01:59:51.274 --> 01:59:52.637]  Direct from Austin.
[01:59:53.338 --> 01:59:56.543]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:00:14.341 --> 02:00:19.223]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are doing about 20 minutes or so of Overdrive today.
[02:00:19.323 --> 02:00:21.504]  Pastor Lindsey Williams is our guest.
[02:00:21.944 --> 02:00:27.667]  I really appreciate him breaking his intel with us a week and a half ago here on air.
[02:00:28.427 --> 02:00:32.389]  He's in high demand around the country, but back with us today to give us any new developments.
[02:00:32.949 --> 02:00:35.991]  I want to go to Brian, Jerry, Dave, and others that are patiently holding.
[02:00:36.551 --> 02:00:49.178]  If you've got a comment for Lindsey Williams, a question, or you want to talk about the oil spill and Obama's response to it, where you see all this going, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[02:00:49.619 --> 02:00:56.443]  I also want to just add that your purchase of my documentary films makes this radio broadcast
[02:00:56.943 --> 02:00:57.503]  Possible.
[02:00:58.243 --> 02:01:14.589]  And whether it's Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, Invisible Empire, New Order Defined, our newest film, so important, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, other films we carry like Camp FEMA, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, The Fall of the Republic that details the whole banking takeover and the Obama agenda.
[02:01:15.869 --> 02:01:18.030]  Purchasing these videos makes my radio show
[02:01:19.622 --> 02:01:22.626]  And everything we do here possible, the news websites, everything.
[02:01:22.646 --> 02:01:29.133]  You can also watch all these films at super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv which is 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[02:01:29.153 --> 02:01:32.457]  You can also share your passcodes with friends and family.
[02:01:32.497 --> 02:01:34.660]  My goal is to get this information out to the people.
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:37.403]  And so I want to thank everyone that has supported us.
[02:01:37.723 --> 02:01:41.447]  Go to InfoWars.com to get the high quality DVDs with expanded extras.
[02:01:41.888 --> 02:01:43.129]  Or you can write to us at P.O.

[02:01:44.190 --> 02:01:45.131]  Or you can call toll free 888...
[02:01:50.077 --> 02:01:50.297]  I think
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:12.220]  Thank you.
[02:02:30.249 --> 02:02:35.911]  But no one can deny this radio show is having the biggest effect out there of any alternative media transmission.
[02:02:36.311 --> 02:02:41.293]  And we try to do the best job we can and we appreciate everybody putting up with us because none of us are perfect.
[02:02:41.333 --> 02:02:42.773]  But again, we're trying the best we can.
[02:02:43.293 --> 02:02:49.456]  Lindsey, before we go to Brian, Jerry, Dave, Dick, and others, please, any other
[02:02:51.573 --> 02:03:13.454]  information that you forgot to cover uh... or what your source told you about the oil spill or where you see this going anything else you haven't gotten to before we go to calls where i see it going i think this is very important uh... they say that there's no possibility of them doing anything about this for at least four months can you comprehend
[02:03:14.338 --> 02:03:14.859]  I think?
[02:03:28.321 --> 02:03:31.945]  And they say, in order to do that, there's four months involved in doing it.
[02:03:32.285 --> 02:03:33.487]  And they haven't even started yet.
[02:03:34.007 --> 02:03:40.454]  So this means that you're going to have a continued process of what's taking place right now for at least that period of time.
[02:03:40.594 --> 02:03:44.558]  And then, as my sources originally told me, Stuart,
[02:03:44.798 --> 02:03:50.607]  I mean, I could actually hear the fear in their voices when they said the only alternative is a nuclear device.
[02:03:51.047 --> 02:03:53.691]  And they said, but we don't like that idea.
[02:03:53.812 --> 02:03:54.473]  I said, why?
[02:03:54.933 --> 02:04:00.622]  They said, because if we fracture this strata that has such tremendous pressure,
[02:04:01.465 --> 02:04:03.826]  And he said there will never be any stopping of it.
[02:04:04.366 --> 02:04:06.347]  And he said, we don't even want to think about that.
[02:04:06.827 --> 02:04:14.189]  Well, neither do I. To never stop this oil from coming out into the Gulf of Mexico, I mean, this is unthinkable.
[02:04:14.249 --> 02:04:17.750]  It would be a disaster such as the world could never even imagine.
[02:04:18.290 --> 02:04:21.011]  All right, secondly, there is no need for any of this.
[02:04:21.810 --> 02:04:23.492]  None of this should have ever happened.
[02:04:23.992 --> 02:04:30.138]  We have, on our own soil, in North and South Dakota and Montana, the Bakken Oil Reserve.
[02:04:30.538 --> 02:04:32.981]  It has already been put in the Congressional Record.
[02:04:33.381 --> 02:04:34.903]  The Congressmen know it's there.
[02:04:35.403 --> 02:04:42.570]  And the only thing that is keeping this oil on the land, not in the Gulf of Mexico or in the waters, from being produced
[02:04:43.396 --> 02:04:44.237]  Congress won't let them.
[02:04:44.477 --> 02:04:45.037]  They're crazy.
[02:04:45.317 --> 02:04:46.638]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:04:47.058 --> 02:05:00.547]  It's 8 times as much oil as Saudi Arabia, 18 times as much oil as Iraq, 21 times as much oil as Kuwait, 22 times as much oil as Iran, 500 times as much oil as Yemen.
[02:05:00.907 --> 02:05:03.509]  We have it on our own soil, on the land.
[02:05:03.529 --> 02:05:06.391]  They could begin drilling any day they want.
[02:05:06.952 --> 02:05:14.912]  It is not a super deep well and they know that we have a supply and we didn't have to do this in the Gulf of Mexico Alex.
[02:05:16.877 --> 02:05:31.483]  Well, those are really pertinent points that you make, Lindsey, and it's the type of thing that the media loves because it just goes on every day with new facets and new information.
[02:05:31.503 --> 02:05:44.648]  It becomes a soap opera, but it's a real-world soap opera destroying sea turtles and dolphins and fisheries and fishermen's lives, and the people involved in the cleanups are getting sick from the dispersants and the oil.
[02:05:45.928 --> 02:05:55.274]  And you got volcanoes going off in Iceland, shutting down air traffic, and you've got depression, and countries falling, and this quickening, accelerating.
[02:05:55.654 --> 02:05:58.896]  Very, very bizarre to see this unfolding.
[02:05:58.936 --> 02:06:00.417]  Let's hurry now through your calls.
[02:06:00.437 --> 02:06:02.758]  I want to thank everybody for calling in and for holding.
[02:06:03.099 --> 02:06:04.940]  Brian in Ohio, welcome.
[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:05.560]  You're on the air.
[02:06:05.580 --> 02:06:07.081]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:06:07.381 --> 02:06:07.681]  Good, sir.
[02:06:07.701 --> 02:06:08.041]  Go ahead.
[02:06:08.862 --> 02:06:13.825]  Alex mentioned a few months ago that the elite tell their story through movies.
[02:06:14.978 --> 02:06:23.549]  And supposedly, in the movement of knowing, that there was a mention of an oil spill or an explosion on April 20th.
[02:06:23.609 --> 02:06:26.293]  Well, if there's any correlation with that.
[02:06:27.230 --> 02:06:43.438]  Well, there's a lot of movies and a lot of TV shows where the globalists do predictive programming, where they throw in your face what they're planning to do later as kind of an inside joke to themselves as a calling card, but also to subconsciously prepare you for it to happen.
[02:06:44.258 --> 02:06:55.144]  And there's hundreds of examples, but the best example is the fact that six months before 9-11, the lone gunman, a spinoff of The X-Files,
[02:06:56.084 --> 02:07:00.866]  The CIA contacted Chris Carter and others, and I was told this by Dean Hagelin, star of the show.
[02:07:02.126 --> 02:07:18.553]  He was so concerned about this, he traveled to Austin to speak with me, said the CIA planted those storylines on them, and he went on to say that, well, I mean, you watch the show, the government hijacks a jet to fly it in the World Trade Center,
[02:07:19.895 --> 02:07:22.258]  To blame it on Afghanistan.
[02:07:23.019 --> 02:07:28.147]  And the government uses a drill, a terror drill, to make the rest of the government stand down.
[02:07:28.167 --> 02:07:31.151]  And that's actually what happened on 9-11.
[02:07:31.992 --> 02:07:33.514]  And so there is something to that.
[02:07:33.574 --> 02:07:34.636]  I appreciate your call.
[02:07:34.676 --> 02:07:35.337]  Anything else, Brian?
[02:07:36.733 --> 02:07:37.334]  Appreciate it.
[02:07:37.374 --> 02:07:37.654]  Thank you.
[02:07:37.894 --> 02:07:38.274]  Thank you.
[02:07:38.615 --> 02:07:39.956]  Any comments on that, Lindsey?
[02:07:39.976 --> 02:07:45.760]  Because you say your source, who's a former oil company executive, told you it was an accident.
[02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:51.124]  You know, a globalist a lot of times will tell people the truth for a long time.
[02:07:51.144 --> 02:07:53.546]  Did we lose Lindsey or did we lose Brian?
[02:07:54.847 --> 02:07:56.028]  Okay, Lindsey, you there?
[02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:03.481]  I didn't hear the last of that because of a dial tone.
[02:08:03.621 --> 02:08:06.722]  Yeah, I think we have a phone system hiccup there, but we'll work on that.
[02:08:07.883 --> 02:08:12.404]  I'm not saying this is what happened, but I know who your oil executive contact is.
[02:08:12.725 --> 02:08:14.205]  You've gotten good intel in the past.
[02:08:14.265 --> 02:08:15.466]  It's turned out to be very accurate.
[02:08:16.006 --> 02:08:20.087]  You said a year before, when oil was $60 a barrel, that it was going to be $150, and that happened.
[02:08:23.544 --> 02:08:41.248]  And of course, Bilderberg Group was saying similar things, and so these elites go in circles, you know, the same circles, but a lot of times these globalists will give people good info, to then later at a key time give them true info, but mix some lies in to put out disinfo.
[02:08:41.268 --> 02:08:45.650]  I mean, how does your oil company executive friend know that this wasn't staged?
[02:08:45.670 --> 02:08:51.111]  87-year-old man has cancer, facing the grave.
[02:08:52.294 --> 02:08:55.956]  Uh, he has never told me anything that was wrong over the past 35 years.
[02:08:56.597 --> 02:08:58.938]  I have no choice to believe what he's saying right now.
[02:08:58.958 --> 02:09:04.722]  Uh, Atlantic Ridgefield, former, retired now, saying the same thing.
[02:09:04.742 --> 02:09:11.366]  Um, there's one thing I learned, Alex, when I lived with the elite, and that is they do have a moral code.
[02:09:11.766 --> 02:09:14.268]  It's quite different than the moral code that you and I have.
[02:09:14.888 --> 02:09:20.892]  And one of the facets of their moral code is that they must tell the world everything they're going to do before they do it.
[02:09:22.044 --> 02:09:22.664]  Uh, Katrina?
[02:09:23.325 --> 02:09:28.287]  Yeah, they had an airstorm just a few weeks before it and told you everything they were going to do.
[02:09:28.307 --> 02:09:37.670]  Look, the thing is, the average person does not know how to interpret what these people are saying, but they do tell you ahead of time what they're going to do.
[02:09:38.371 --> 02:09:39.391]  What happened in the Gulf?
[02:09:39.951 --> 02:09:48.055]  There was no ahead of time on this, because this happened by accident, but they are going to use this now to accomplish their 2012 timeline.
[02:09:51.337 --> 02:09:55.179]  All right, let's go back to your phone calls here.
[02:09:55.299 --> 02:09:59.462]  Let's talk with Jerry in Indiana.
[02:09:59.482 --> 02:10:00.362]  You're on the air, Jerry.
[02:10:00.382 --> 02:10:02.584]  Hello, Alex.
[02:10:02.744 --> 02:10:06.766]  I'm a Prison Planet member for many years and bought two of your videos this week.
[02:10:06.906 --> 02:10:07.386]  Thank you.
[02:10:07.546 --> 02:10:08.387]  Couldn't do it without you.
[02:10:08.507 --> 02:10:13.630]  And we need you more than ever, Alex Jones, right now.
[02:10:14.370 --> 02:10:16.432]  I'm buying the videos, getting them copied.
[02:10:16.752 --> 02:10:18.653]  Lindsey Williams, I bought two of yours.
[02:10:19.545 --> 02:10:21.806]  I can't thank you enough for what you're doing.
[02:10:22.867 --> 02:10:27.009]  Exposing this fraud and these elitists.
[02:10:27.229 --> 02:10:28.850]  My question is for Lindsey.
[02:10:29.490 --> 02:10:47.300]  Lindsey, the worst case scenario, I know this is going to be hard to answer, but if this, you know, this oil in the Gulf, if it meets up with a major hurricane, and Alex, chime in here, too, how far north will this oil go?
[02:10:52.362 --> 02:11:09.094]  Well, I'm not a hydrologist, Jerry, and I'm not a meteorologist, but they've said that a hurricane could push this oil 20-30 miles inland up the estuaries, back up the rivers, and that a lot of it could be picked up in the storms and dumped in on the land.
[02:11:09.774 --> 02:11:12.356]  The good news is the oil is biodegradable.
[02:11:12.396 --> 02:11:18.160]  It does have some toxins in it, but there's all these millions of gallons of super-toxic dispersant in it.
[02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:20.281]  That's going to be very destructive.
[02:11:20.561 --> 02:11:22.443]  Jerry, it sounded like your phone was fading out.
[02:11:22.463 --> 02:11:23.143]  Are you still there?
[02:11:24.304 --> 02:11:25.185]  Yes, I'm still here.
[02:11:25.225 --> 02:11:25.785]  Can you hear me?
[02:11:26.026 --> 02:11:26.666]  Yes, I can.
[02:11:27.186 --> 02:11:30.269]  Lindsey Williams, comment on what Jerry was just saying.
[02:11:30.970 --> 02:11:35.635]  Well, it's not the oil itself that has this kind of reddish tint to it that's most concerning to me.
[02:11:35.655 --> 02:11:41.340]  It's what else is coming out of that well in the way of gases, toxic gases.
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:41.901]  Well, that's right.
[02:11:41.921 --> 02:11:49.288]  They keep saying it's oil, but I mean oil's... ...all the way up to New York and all the way up to the east coast of the United States of America.
[02:11:49.948 --> 02:11:53.412]  Well, that's right, because it's not just what can be blown in by a hurricane.
[02:11:53.492 --> 02:11:54.273]  They admit that the
[02:11:56.363 --> 02:12:08.307]  The tidal forces go out of the Gulf, around Florida in those channels, and travels up the East Coast.
[02:12:11.641 --> 02:12:12.461]  Yes, that's true.
[02:12:12.682 --> 02:12:15.243]  In fact, it's going to devastate the tourist trade.
[02:12:15.263 --> 02:12:22.987]  A talk show host the other day said that a guest had cancelled, would not be on his talk show that night.
[02:12:23.067 --> 02:12:23.687]  I said, why?
[02:12:24.127 --> 02:12:27.909]  He said she's a tourist travel agent on the Keys.
[02:12:28.649 --> 02:12:36.193]  When they found out she was going to be on his show, they threatened her and told her not to appear under any circumstances.
[02:12:36.213 --> 02:12:37.934]  She called and cancelled out as a guest.
[02:12:38.624 --> 02:12:39.025]  Uh, yeah.
[02:12:39.505 --> 02:12:48.133]  This thing is getting to the point that it's going to be... I don't know what the overall effect will have, but it's not going to be pretty.
[02:12:50.623 --> 02:12:52.263]  Well, I appreciate your call, Jerry.
[02:12:52.543 --> 02:12:56.724]  It's a very serious issue, and the word I was looking for was ocean currents.
[02:12:57.384 --> 02:12:59.345]  They know where the currents are going.
[02:12:59.365 --> 02:13:15.809]  You know, the currents sometimes change a little bit, but worldwide, these currents for thousands of years have been very, very accurate to the point in the Atlantic, you know, ships knew you go to this point, you get in this current, and it basically takes you here.
[02:13:16.409 --> 02:13:17.429]  That's why sailing ships
[02:13:18.189 --> 02:13:25.295]  It might take them two weeks to cross the Atlantic, but then it might take them six months to get back across, because they didn't have favorable winds or currents.
[02:13:25.756 --> 02:13:27.317]  And they know where those currents are.
[02:13:27.337 --> 02:13:30.079]  Here's the Gulf of Mexico, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:13:30.419 --> 02:13:33.442]  Here's Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida.
[02:13:34.223 --> 02:13:39.887]  And the oil spills here off Mississippi, and the currents go down, around the Keys, past Cuba.
[02:13:40.208 --> 02:13:43.150]  I mean, boy, Cuba and the Keys are really going to get it.
[02:13:43.611 --> 02:13:45.812]  And then, because most of the oil is staying out to sea,
[02:13:47.176 --> 02:13:58.384]  And then it's going to go up, and then the currents come in very close to shore, all the way up the East Coast, up to Canada, and then up towards Greenland and Iceland and England and Northern Europe.
[02:13:58.644 --> 02:14:01.646]  And Northern Europe's going to be hit by this stuff in three or four months.
[02:14:02.046 --> 02:14:10.292]  And if that oil well just keeps going and going and going and going, there's just no telling the type of destruction it's going to cause.
[02:14:11.773 --> 02:14:14.895]  The whole world is going to want the American taxpayer to pay.
[02:14:14.976 --> 02:14:15.616]  You watch!
[02:14:16.216 --> 02:14:17.998]  Even though this is an international company.
[02:14:18.438 --> 02:14:28.966]  That's why it's dangerous to be blaming England for this, because if you can blame a nation, then you can blame a government, rather than blaming these globalist corporations that are literally destroying our national governments.
[02:14:29.446 --> 02:14:32.008]  And I'm not defending our national governments, they're criminal as well.
[02:14:32.048 --> 02:14:34.530]  The point is, these corporations are even more lawless.
[02:14:35.211 --> 02:14:36.652]  Let's talk to Dave in Arizona.
[02:14:36.672 --> 02:14:37.833]  Dave, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:14:37.853 --> 02:14:38.173]  Go ahead.
[02:14:39.335 --> 02:14:40.035]  Hello, Alex.
[02:14:40.055 --> 02:14:40.835]  Hello, Lindsey.
[02:14:40.895 --> 02:14:42.076]  This is Dave out of Portside.
[02:14:42.096 --> 02:14:43.476]  Listening to you on 12.160.
[02:14:44.016 --> 02:14:45.177]  Lindsey, I have a question.
[02:14:45.997 --> 02:14:50.378]  In reference to the nuclear option, how many devices, how deep would they go?
[02:14:50.398 --> 02:14:57.641]  I assume that the nuclear devices would cause the whole thing to cave in on itself.
[02:14:58.201 --> 02:14:59.521]  Would it cause a tsunami?
[02:14:59.581 --> 02:15:01.022]  How big would the tsunami be?
[02:15:01.102 --> 02:15:02.422]  And would there be any fallout?
[02:15:03.901 --> 02:15:06.443]  Some of those things they answered for me, some they did not.
[02:15:06.483 --> 02:15:10.766]  They merely said that they would angle drill down into the depth of the ocean.
[02:15:11.147 --> 02:15:17.451]  Now understand, you've got 5,000 foot water here that they're going to have to start with before they can even do that angle drilling.
[02:15:18.032 --> 02:15:30.061]  Then when they angle drill down, they would go down, I don't know, they did not say how deep, and plant this nuclear device and it would actually, what should I say, solidify the soil.
[02:15:30.641 --> 02:15:32.221]  Does that answer your question?
[02:15:58.567 --> 02:15:59.688]  Okay, I guess it does.
[02:15:59.828 --> 02:16:01.349]  Up next is Dave in Arizona.
[02:16:01.369 --> 02:16:02.930]  Dave, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:16:02.970 --> 02:16:03.330]  Go ahead.
[02:16:04.630 --> 02:16:05.191]  Yeah.
[02:16:05.671 --> 02:16:06.632]  Oh, it's Dick in Nevada.
[02:16:06.652 --> 02:16:07.412]  I already went to Dave.
[02:16:07.432 --> 02:16:08.012]  Go ahead, Dick.
[02:16:09.013 --> 02:16:09.473]  Yeah, hello.
[02:16:10.354 --> 02:16:12.295]  Good to talk to you guys.
[02:16:12.595 --> 02:16:13.375]  I'm kind of curious.
[02:16:13.395 --> 02:16:24.622]  You know, they started talking about this hooded thing and trying to capture and save some of this a couple months ago and the use of other countries and ships.
[02:16:24.862 --> 02:16:28.244]  They could recover some of this stuff if they wanted to make an attempt at it.
[02:16:29.207 --> 02:16:32.669]  Sure seems like they're using this as a convenient crisis.
[02:16:33.670 --> 02:16:40.794]  Probably going to sacrifice BP in the process, but in order to get this cap and trade or whatever tax they're going to jam on us.
[02:16:41.935 --> 02:16:53.202]  But with that Hoodard thing, it seems we likely would be able to pressurize and separate and save some of that oil, plus be able to probably burn off the other gases and the poisonous stuff.
[02:16:54.003 --> 02:16:56.504]  Well, they admit now that they are going to create
[02:16:58.436 --> 02:16:59.880]  A flare to burn off.
[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:02.707]  They were saying 10% of it and they said they've got a hood over it.
[02:17:03.598 --> 02:17:04.879]  That's getting some of the oil.
[02:17:05.319 --> 02:17:13.862]  There's just so much oil that it's basically trying to bail out a swimming pool using a teacup.
[02:17:14.202 --> 02:17:19.585]  And the swimming pool is always being refilled as you're there with a teacup trying to capture it.
[02:17:19.625 --> 02:17:24.907]  I mean, engineering-wise, though, it looks like it is a serious obstacle.
[02:17:25.487 --> 02:17:28.148]  And expanding on that, they did block the states.
[02:17:28.248 --> 02:17:31.550]  Lindsey, what's your take on that, how they block the states
[02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:46.556]  One weekend, the states were wanting to go block their estuaries and protect the fisheries, protect the key areas in Louisiana and Mississippi, and the feds did come in and say, no, wait for our response, and did everything they could to block the response.
[02:17:47.157 --> 02:17:50.358]  Is that so there's a bigger disaster and the feds get more power?
[02:17:50.378 --> 02:17:52.559]  Because we saw the same thing with Katrina.
[02:17:53.059 --> 02:17:53.980]  What's your view on that?
[02:17:54.721 --> 02:17:59.504]  Well, it's unbelievable that the federal government can override the state governments like this.
[02:17:59.524 --> 02:18:02.085]  State rights are being completely disregarded.
[02:18:02.925 --> 02:18:04.386]  And I think it's an atrocity.
[02:18:04.486 --> 02:18:08.228]  Every single politician up there should be thrown out, and we've got to start all over again.
[02:18:09.409 --> 02:18:15.332]  Our agencies have become little Hitlers, and we're not even allowing states to do anything.
[02:18:15.512 --> 02:18:16.713]  I think it's an atrocity.
[02:18:17.353 --> 02:18:18.454]  It is all about power.
[02:18:18.474 --> 02:18:20.195]  I appreciate the call, Dick.
[02:18:20.235 --> 02:18:20.735]  Anything else?
[02:18:22.726 --> 02:18:29.818]  We need to get these corporate monopolies busted up and back to companies that are responsible and not be regionalized.
[02:18:29.878 --> 02:18:32.081]  Why don't we get BP out in the Gulf and run our...
[02:18:33.326 --> 02:18:35.187]  A line of Alaskan stuff.
[02:18:35.367 --> 02:18:38.627]  Well, notice it's BP whose symbol is the green flower.
[02:18:39.028 --> 02:18:44.029]  They're the ones always pushing the environmental tyranny, and I think they're behind it.
[02:18:44.149 --> 02:18:47.730]  I mean, they gave orders that they knew were going to cause an explosion.
[02:18:47.810 --> 02:18:51.391]  Their oil company workers are on record saying, we knew this was going to happen.
[02:18:52.191 --> 02:18:56.152]  And they can say, well, we didn't do it on purpose.
[02:18:56.212 --> 02:19:01.154]  But they knew, drilling enough of these super deep wells, that if they did this in an unconventional
[02:19:03.755 --> 02:19:11.180]  Half, you know what way, a slip-shot way that it was going to result in this and now they're using it.
[02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:12.520]  There's no doubt they're using it.
[02:19:12.841 --> 02:19:13.681]  I appreciate your call.
[02:19:13.721 --> 02:19:14.382]  Good points, Dick.
[02:19:14.822 --> 02:19:15.883]  Stewart in Virginia.
[02:19:15.923 --> 02:19:17.123]  You're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:19:17.143 --> 02:19:17.824]  Go ahead, Stewart.
[02:19:18.644 --> 02:19:19.705]  Hey, Alex.
[02:19:19.885 --> 02:19:21.406]  First time to talk to you.
[02:19:21.446 --> 02:19:23.387]  You're an honorable guy doing a good job here.
[02:19:23.628 --> 02:19:24.208]  Thank you, sir.
[02:19:24.228 --> 02:19:24.788]  I appreciate it.
[02:19:24.808 --> 02:19:28.751]  Okay, I'm sort of an inventor, so I kind of have a lot of
[02:19:29.597 --> 02:19:31.559]  Understanding mechanics and stuff like that.
[02:19:32.039 --> 02:19:34.661]  And I remember I listened to these guys.
[02:19:35.242 --> 02:19:37.524]  They had an interview on them from CNN.
[02:19:37.544 --> 02:19:40.386]  And these guys had survived the blast or whatever.
[02:19:41.067 --> 02:19:43.609]  And they asked them, what did it sound like?
[02:19:43.989 --> 02:19:50.054]  And one of the guys said it sounded like the tale of the beast or the devil, the dragon himself.
[02:19:50.774 --> 02:19:57.240]  Now I'm not putting anything biblical into this, but what I'm saying is, he said, this was a seasoned oil guy, he said he never
[02:19:57.731 --> 02:19:58.492]  He was on the rig.
[02:19:58.552 --> 02:20:00.934]  He never heard anything like this in his life.
[02:20:00.974 --> 02:20:07.200]  He said it was like, it was like the pit of hell was coming out of that thing when it was burning.
[02:20:07.821 --> 02:20:14.747]  So, uh, I know at 30, you think this well, the pastor, you think this well was, he said it was 25,000 feet down?
[02:20:17.406 --> 02:20:20.587]  Yeah, this well is 5,000 feet in the ocean.
[02:20:20.968 --> 02:20:28.071]  Then when they began at the ocean floor, they went between 25,000 and 30,000 feet when they hit this strata of oil.
[02:20:28.531 --> 02:20:42.957]  But the reason this gentleman heard things like that that's never been heard before, because from all the sources that I can talk with, there has never been a well hit on the face of the Earth that had between 20,000 and 70,000 pounds per square inch of pressure.
[02:20:43.457 --> 02:20:46.759]  This caused an explosion such as probably never been heard before.
[02:20:47.216 --> 02:20:51.920]  Well, Lindsey, I like your analogy of being in a jet airplane at 33,000 feet.
[02:20:52.741 --> 02:20:56.664]  This well is 30,000 feet under the ocean floor, 5,000 feet of water above it.
[02:20:57.084 --> 02:21:04.771]  So that's a greater distance from being up in a jumbo jet looking down on mountains that look like little mole hills.
[02:21:05.151 --> 02:21:12.458]  I mean, that is at a deep oil well, and they're finding incredibly high-pressured oil and gas
[02:21:14.062 --> 02:21:16.903]  Twenty-five, thirty thousand feet down below the Earth.
[02:21:17.443 --> 02:21:25.006]  I mean, there are so many mysteries of this world, and who knows what they're going to tap into one day, drilling into the Earth.
[02:21:25.066 --> 02:21:27.547]  I mean, man knows so little.
[02:21:27.567 --> 02:21:36.750]  And look at this disaster, and think about all the nanotech, the genetic engineering, the cross-species manipulations, all of the disasters they've had.
[02:21:37.050 --> 02:21:39.771]  The Hadron Super Collider over in CERN.
[02:21:40.271 --> 02:21:49.097]  Switzerland, where their own scientists say, yeah, there's a small chance it could make a black hole, or a singularity, or a strangelet, and could destroy the Earth.
[02:21:50.718 --> 02:21:58.402]  I mean, it's a recklessness, and this just gives us an idea of bigger disasters to come.
[02:21:59.663 --> 02:22:20.380]  As man's common sense doesn't match up to the incredible knowledge we've now gained, but not just the knowledge, the playing around in a fireworks factory with a flamethrower, not knowing what we're going to hit, what we're going to catch on fire, it seems like a ticking time bomb.
[02:22:21.311 --> 02:22:24.212]  This is a super deep well.
[02:22:24.372 --> 02:22:26.773]  Please understand what BP has done here.
[02:22:27.393 --> 02:22:37.998]  They were copying the Russians because they knew that they could become the leader of oil production in the world, next to Russia itself, if they accomplish this super deep well.
[02:22:38.298 --> 02:22:43.360]  They are treading into areas that humankind has never treaded into before.
[02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:45.161]  And the Russians, of course, too.
[02:22:46.544 --> 02:22:54.026]  And of course the Russians two weeks ago released a film footage of them using a hydrogen bomb to put out one of these super deep wells on land.
[02:22:55.071 --> 02:22:58.033]  So, I mean, it's one thing to put one out on land using a nuke.
[02:22:58.113 --> 02:23:01.216]  It's another thing to do it in the ocean, when you've already got all these fissures.
[02:23:01.616 --> 02:23:07.300]  This will probably just blow a bigger hole, and now you'll have a whole bunch of other strata of oil coming up out of it.
[02:23:07.561 --> 02:23:09.222]  And then BP will get what it wants.
[02:23:09.282 --> 02:23:13.165]  It'll get its carbon tax, and then they've already said they're going to create a subsidiary of BP.
[02:23:13.565 --> 02:23:18.229]  This company will be allowed to implode, and the money, like Enron, will move on to the next operation.
[02:23:18.969 --> 02:23:20.350]  Let's talk to David in Oregon.
[02:23:20.371 --> 02:23:21.672]  David, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:23:21.692 --> 02:23:21.992]  Go ahead.
[02:23:23.374 --> 02:23:23.935]  Oh, thank you.
[02:23:24.395 --> 02:23:25.416]  I appreciate it, Alex.
[02:23:25.496 --> 02:23:27.958]  And by the way, my wife and I appreciate you very, very much.
[02:23:29.899 --> 02:23:43.050]  My question to you is, and to Lindsey, is as far as the oil well is concerned, you know the live BP broadcast that they have on the Internet?
[02:23:43.430 --> 02:23:43.690]  Yes.
[02:23:43.851 --> 02:23:47.233]  Is that in fact of the oil well head?
[02:23:50.168 --> 02:23:50.928]  They say it is.
[02:23:50.968 --> 02:23:52.169]  They're such incredible liars.
[02:23:52.209 --> 02:23:52.669]  Who knows?
[02:23:53.109 --> 02:23:53.469]  Lindsey?
[02:23:53.989 --> 02:23:54.949]  That's right.
[02:23:55.270 --> 02:23:56.770]  I agree exactly with what you said.
[02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:58.891]  You cannot depend on anything they say.
[02:24:02.452 --> 02:24:05.573]  But I think the answer is we don't know, sir.
[02:24:05.613 --> 02:24:06.113]  Anything else?
[02:24:06.133 --> 02:24:19.377]  The reason why I was asking was because I helped put the fires out in Kuwait and the oil well fires that we had over there, of course, were considerably different.
[02:24:20.154 --> 02:24:39.131]  But I was looking at this, the plumage coming off this head, and I found it interesting that if it was, I wanted the distinction, when they broke the well, when the well was first came in, did it, was that when it got the 70,000 pounds pressure or up to that?
[02:24:39.691 --> 02:24:43.114]  Or are they saying that it's 70,000 pounds of pressure now?
[02:24:43.234 --> 02:24:47.058]  And the reason why I'm asking is because if you look at the pictures on the video,
[02:24:47.648 --> 02:24:52.171]  You can see that there is all kinds of material floating around in the water.
[02:24:52.611 --> 02:25:02.557]  If it was 70,000 pound psi of oil pressure that was actually coming out of that head, there would be so much turbulence, the ROVs couldn't be around that.
[02:25:03.158 --> 02:25:06.620]  And you can see that the stuff floating around in the water
[02:25:07.060 --> 02:25:10.023]  Is just lightly going into the plume and coming out.
[02:25:10.683 --> 02:25:17.709]  Well that's the point I wanted to say and I'm really glad we're taking your calls on this and stay there because I want you to have a counterpoint.
[02:25:18.872 --> 02:25:43.848]  I'm no expert, but I know it's under 5,000 feet of water, so it's under incredible pressure, and that might cause something coming out at a higher pressure to at least look like it was moving slower, but I don't understand all the hydrology, so I'm just, you know, speculating here, but this is a question I'm going to expand on tomorrow, and we'll open the phones up, because it doesn't look like it's coming out with that much pressure.
[02:25:43.868 --> 02:25:44.309]  It's just kind of...
[02:25:45.649 --> 02:25:49.690]  You know, coming out like it's, you know, 500 pounds of pressure.
[02:25:50.050 --> 02:25:55.472]  I mean, we've all seen water coming out of a water drain, and if you put black dye in it, it would look about like this.
[02:25:56.172 --> 02:26:03.955]  It doesn't look like it's these, you know, tens of thousands of barrels a day.
[02:26:04.615 --> 02:26:09.317]  So that's a really good point, and I've sat there so many times and watched the live
[02:26:10.197 --> 02:26:15.821]  Well head cam, and it just doesn't look like it's that much oil.
[02:26:16.621 --> 02:26:28.189]  And I'm not saying versus what Lindsay's source says, tens of thousands of pounds of pressure, or what the mainstream media is saying now that it's 60 plus million gallons or whatever, day 60 something.
[02:26:29.110 --> 02:26:30.951]  I mean, it's all estimations.
[02:26:31.011 --> 02:26:32.172]  Lindsay, your comments on that.
[02:26:32.192 --> 02:26:32.973]  It's a really good question.
[02:26:33.493 --> 02:26:37.957]  Yeah, I did have an oil man that responded to this.
[02:26:37.977 --> 02:26:42.581]  I have not mentioned it before because I didn't, you know, I think so.
[02:26:43.361 --> 02:26:45.904]  This oil man said to me, he said, I've watched those pictures.
[02:26:45.924 --> 02:26:48.926]  Now he's not with BP, another oil company.
[02:26:49.267 --> 02:26:52.729]  He said, I have watched those pictures and he said they don't make any sense.
[02:26:53.070 --> 02:26:57.574]  He said, I can't believe that this was really the pictures of what's happening down there at that wellhead.
[02:26:57.914 --> 02:26:58.975]  That was his response.
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:03.702]  And notice how the media is providing this video for us.
[02:27:04.302 --> 02:27:05.143]  Anything else, Caller?
[02:27:06.603 --> 02:27:08.605]  Yeah, I'd like to say one more thing.
[02:27:10.025 --> 02:27:23.213]  Noticing, okay, the video, by the way, which just went off the air, but noticing in the video that the ROVs are moving around freely with free motion, floating at will and so forth, positioning themselves at different points around the well.
[02:27:23.673 --> 02:27:26.555]  There's no turbulence to speak of that you can see in the area.
[02:27:27.150 --> 02:27:36.653]  The stuff is coming out as we just spoke about, but what's even more interesting is that understanding that this well is at 4,900 feet, so it's almost a mile down.
[02:27:37.213 --> 02:27:45.995]  Considering the differential, 70,000 pounds PSI would give you about 25,000 to 35,000 pounds PSI worth of differential.
[02:27:46.775 --> 02:27:52.037]  And even at that depth, you'd have turbulence beyond your imagination, and I don't see anything like this.
[02:27:52.117 --> 02:27:55.818]  So what I'm seeing here is a lie, and I am an engineer.
[02:27:56.743 --> 02:28:00.584]  This stuff here is stuff I've been doing for many, many years.
[02:28:00.684 --> 02:28:11.828]  I gave Boots and Coots and Red Adair the technology to put out the fires that you saw in Kuwait using the hydro tube with the nitrogen shower nozzle and the jet engines with the half tracks back in 1990.
[02:28:12.388 --> 02:28:16.589]  This stuff that I'm seeing, Alex, is a lie and I think that
[02:28:17.333 --> 02:28:19.414]  The American people are being spoofed on this.
[02:28:19.594 --> 02:28:20.615]  That's all I have to say.
[02:28:20.635 --> 02:28:21.816]  Well, David, don't hang up.
[02:28:22.496 --> 02:28:24.037]  I mean, I believe you sound very credible.
[02:28:24.077 --> 02:28:25.738]  I'd like to have you on as a guest.
[02:28:26.979 --> 02:28:40.527]  If you want to not use your name, just send us some basic credentials, and then we can make up whatever name you like, as long as I know that you are an engineer who's worked with petroleum, because these are the type of guests that I do want to get on the show.
[02:28:41.047 --> 02:28:46.070]  And since you are an engineer, perhaps you or others could do the calculation of, okay,
[02:28:47.050 --> 02:28:50.052]  Uh, you know, they say X amount is coming out a day.
[02:28:50.072 --> 02:29:05.283]  Uh, the wellhead is this diameter, and so we should be able to calculate the rough, uh, PSI, uh, for what they claim is coming out and then visually calibrate that to the
[02:29:05.884 --> 02:29:06.545]  We're good to go.
[02:29:22.176 --> 02:29:23.016]  We're happy to Alex.
[02:29:23.377 --> 02:29:34.181]  Okay guys, will you, Matt, will you get his number please and ask him if he wants to give us his full name or if he wants to just send us some credentials.
[02:29:34.862 --> 02:29:37.183]  But let's not forget about this because I want to get him on.
[02:29:37.903 --> 02:29:43.645]  In fact, I want to get some petroleum engineers on who can analyze this and not just read what they're saying in the newspapers.
[02:29:44.006 --> 02:29:50.588]  And if petroleum engineers are scared of being punished or persecuted by the oil industry, email us at
[02:29:53.132 --> 02:30:11.502]  Show tips at Infowars.com and send us documentation of your name and who you really are and we'll hold that in confidence and you can come on and we can call you Mr. X, Mr. Y, Mr. C, Mr. A, whatever you like or make up a fake name for you as long as I know you're a real source because we're going to continue to cover this
[02:30:12.082 --> 02:30:13.163]  We're going to cover it more and more.
[02:30:13.863 --> 02:30:15.304]  I've just seen a lot of oil spills.
[02:30:15.944 --> 02:30:17.565]  I know they're not normally that big of a deal.
[02:30:18.045 --> 02:30:24.308]  They hurt some of the people affected, but the geopolitical overall system, it's not that big of an issue.
[02:30:24.808 --> 02:30:31.632]  But the fact that this just continues and continues, and now they want their carbon tax, and now these companies dump their stock and all this happened.
[02:30:31.932 --> 02:30:35.154]  We've been covering it since it happened, but I'm going to be covering it a lot more here.
[02:30:35.894 --> 02:30:37.595]  While we cover other important news.
[02:30:38.196 --> 02:30:41.998]  But that was an amazing phone call from David in Oregon, wasn't it, Pastor?
[02:30:43.019 --> 02:30:43.720]  Very much so.
[02:30:43.780 --> 02:30:48.803]  In fact, I would love to hear his synopsis of all of this.
[02:30:49.584 --> 02:30:52.426]  Definitely, that would make for a fascinating program, Alex.
[02:30:52.646 --> 02:30:55.688]  Well, we need to just do the calculation because it changes every day.
[02:30:55.728 --> 02:30:57.250]  It seems to be doubling every week.
[02:30:57.970 --> 02:31:04.415]  Lindsey, do you have the numbers on what they claim, what they guesstimate is coming out of that well a day right now?
[02:31:05.785 --> 02:31:08.927]  Well, um, let's see, yes I do.
[02:31:09.787 --> 02:31:12.229]  Matt Simmons says 25,000 barrels a day.
[02:31:12.409 --> 02:31:14.550]  Now my sources did not say that.
[02:31:15.131 --> 02:31:21.455]  My sources said they were somewhere in the neighborhood of, let me go back through my notes here real quick, they didn't give anything near that.
[02:31:22.415 --> 02:31:25.977]  Um, I'll find them here in a moment.
[02:31:26.177 --> 02:31:28.699]  They told me though at the time, they said we're being very conservative.
[02:31:29.552 --> 02:31:32.896]  They said we can't afford to estimate more than what's there.
[02:31:33.937 --> 02:31:35.559]  I know, but let's make the calculation.
[02:31:35.599 --> 02:31:38.061]  If they say it's... I'm looking here real fast to try to find it.
[02:31:38.121 --> 02:31:41.885]  Well, I mean, they're saying 20,000 pounds of pressure.
[02:31:41.905 --> 02:31:42.426]  20,000 gallons.
[02:31:44.288 --> 02:31:47.191]  Wait a minute.
[02:31:47.431 --> 02:31:51.796]  Okay, they said, Mr. Rex, in my book, said 4 million gallons a day.
[02:31:54.428 --> 02:31:57.810]  He said that's very conservative.
[02:31:57.951 --> 02:32:01.893]  He said, I'm taking what we know to be the bottom of the totem pole.
[02:32:02.654 --> 02:32:03.554]  52 gallons to a barrel.
[02:32:15.410 --> 02:32:17.491]  But Matt Simmons says a whole lot more than that as of this past week.
[02:32:17.531 --> 02:32:17.611]  No.
[02:32:17.631 --> 02:32:17.931]  It is not.
[02:32:17.951 --> 02:32:22.832]  And one oil man has already questioned that with me and said that he couldn't believe what he's seeing on that webcam.
[02:32:35.134 --> 02:32:35.554]  Who knows?
[02:32:35.614 --> 02:32:37.115]  It's probably a Pentagon production.
[02:32:37.155 --> 02:32:45.618]  I mean, the CIA admitted two weeks ago they create fake Bin Laden videos, and then they bragged and said, we put fake videos on the news to manipulate you.
[02:32:46.018 --> 02:32:47.139]  I mean, who knows?
[02:32:47.179 --> 02:32:48.419]  It could be an Easter Bunny.
[02:32:48.759 --> 02:32:51.800]  I mean, that's the problem with these liars.
[02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:52.601]  Three more callers.
[02:32:52.621 --> 02:32:53.501]  We're going to let Lindsey go.
[02:32:53.541 --> 02:32:54.541]  We appreciate all his time.
[02:32:54.942 --> 02:32:56.062]  David in New Jersey.
[02:32:56.082 --> 02:32:56.702]  You're on the air.
[02:32:56.722 --> 02:32:58.743]  Hey, Alex.
[02:32:58.843 --> 02:32:59.423]  Hey, Lindsey.
[02:32:59.463 --> 02:32:59.864]  How you doing?
[02:33:00.324 --> 02:33:00.544]  Good.
[02:33:00.564 --> 02:33:00.864]  Go ahead.
[02:33:02.313 --> 02:33:03.594]  I have two questions.
[02:33:03.974 --> 02:33:22.027]  My first one was, I was listening to George Nori on YouTube, and he had this guest on, I don't know his name, but he was saying about like this gas bubble forming around the oil well, and that like if it explodes, or like another explosion happens, it could cause a tsunami.
[02:33:22.549 --> 02:33:24.972]  I just wanted to know if you knew anything about that.
[02:33:25.252 --> 02:33:29.717]  Well, I mean, they did have declassified documents for the Australian, British, and U.S.
[02:33:29.757 --> 02:33:30.878]  governments in the 50s.
[02:33:31.338 --> 02:33:42.691]  Looked at tsunami bombs, where they could detonate bombs, A-bombs or hydrogen weapons, and cause a tsunami and then cover up that it was a nuke.
[02:33:43.231 --> 02:33:45.294]  But that was never used, they claim.
[02:33:46.597 --> 02:33:54.389]  But I have to say that to claim that a oil well explosion underwater would be one...
[02:33:56.095 --> 02:34:03.422]  You know, fraction of a thousandth of a, you know, even low yield, you know, say five megaton hydrogen bomb.
[02:34:03.962 --> 02:34:06.304]  I think that sounds pretty ridiculous, but who knows?
[02:34:06.344 --> 02:34:10.868]  Because people tend to get twisted what is said on talk shows and what aren't.
[02:34:11.028 --> 02:34:18.175]  I asked Lindsey Williams earlier, I should have brought this up during a break, I said, what did you say about who really controls the military?
[02:34:19.264 --> 02:34:22.128]  And that the American people would be shocked if they knew who really controlled it.
[02:34:22.148 --> 02:34:23.770]  And he said, no, I never said that on that show.
[02:34:24.311 --> 02:34:26.374]  And so people may have heard a caller or something.
[02:34:27.355 --> 02:34:30.380]  But what about tsunamis?
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:31.761]  Do you have any comments on that, Lindsey?
[02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:34.151]  Uh, not really.
[02:34:34.171 --> 02:34:36.132]  I have heard the same rumor that you've heard.
[02:34:36.872 --> 02:34:39.673]  But there again, I go back to what I said earlier in the program.
[02:34:39.913 --> 02:34:44.075]  I cannot operate on think so, hope so, hear so.
[02:34:45.076 --> 02:34:49.758]  I have to go to my informants to find it and none of them have indicated this to be the case.
[02:34:49.778 --> 02:34:52.759]  I have heard about this big bubble that's down there.
[02:34:53.099 --> 02:34:54.040]  I hope it's not so.
[02:34:55.845 --> 02:35:02.649]  All right, let's go ahead and take a few final phone calls here in this marathon transmission.
[02:35:02.709 --> 02:35:04.130]  Jeff in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:06.691]  Hi.
[02:35:06.711 --> 02:35:12.034]  I had heard when you said that this was a strata of oil?
[02:35:13.755 --> 02:35:14.356]  That's correct.
[02:35:14.396 --> 02:35:21.620]  That's what they called it was a strata of oil that they went into that they undoubtedly have never penetrated before.
[02:35:22.915 --> 02:35:31.601]  So my question is kind of like in a hydraulic system where heated pressurized oil holds, the force holds something up.
[02:35:32.161 --> 02:35:38.205]  Since they're depressurizing this strata, can we expect to see earthquakes?
[02:35:38.955 --> 02:36:04.907]  uh... in the outer rims of the strata well when you understand the magnitude of the size of the planet uh... you know oil wells uh... taking tens of millions of gallons of oil out from very deep it is negligible compared to the overall structure and you've got all these different strata you know natural gas is is in domes or can even be in sand and then comes out of the rock
[02:36:05.427 --> 02:36:08.910]  And so you're in areas that are actually what you would think of as solid sand or rock.
[02:36:08.950 --> 02:36:10.231]  I'm no engineer, but I've read about it.
[02:36:10.992 --> 02:36:18.578]  You've got oil wells that are shallower, that have caused sinkholes to start, sinkholes to form.
[02:36:19.119 --> 02:36:20.680]  So there is some evidence of that.
[02:36:21.641 --> 02:36:23.843]  The Israelis admit that they've looked at
[02:36:24.924 --> 02:36:28.405]  Yeah, there's got to be something taking place down there.
[02:36:49.780 --> 02:36:56.426]  You know, there again, it's all supposition as far as I'm concerned because I haven't heard my sources say this.
[02:36:57.067 --> 02:37:01.131]  But, you know, this could cause no telling what.
[02:37:01.191 --> 02:37:02.532]  We just have to wait and see, really.
[02:37:04.494 --> 02:37:05.054]  Absolutely.
[02:37:05.114 --> 02:37:06.516]  Caller, does that answer your question?
[02:37:07.737 --> 02:37:08.397]  Yes, it does.
[02:37:08.698 --> 02:37:09.318]  Thank you very much.
[02:37:09.498 --> 02:37:10.059]  Thank you, Jeff.
[02:37:10.119 --> 02:37:10.840]  I appreciate it.
[02:37:11.946 --> 02:37:17.787]  And again, we can get engineers on here, we can get scientists on, we can get geologists, hydrologists.
[02:37:18.147 --> 02:37:24.049]  They're not going to know all the answers because the world is so complex and they're drilling at depths.
[02:37:24.529 --> 02:37:32.631]  I mean, if I got a geologist on who say had worked in a certain area of, say, Limestone County, Texas, and who'd worked there for 20 years drilling
[02:37:33.863 --> 02:37:35.384]  Shallow and deep wells.
[02:37:36.365 --> 02:37:39.048]  And I asked them questions about that area.
[02:37:39.368 --> 02:37:43.311]  They could tell me, with a lot of authority, what was going on and what would probably happen.
[02:37:43.972 --> 02:37:52.359]  But you start getting people out there that are drilling 30,000 feet under the ocean floor, they don't know what's going on.
[02:37:52.419 --> 02:37:53.460]  They don't understand it.
[02:37:54.021 --> 02:37:57.524]  They're learning as they go along, and that's what's so scary about this, Lindsey.
[02:37:58.437 --> 02:37:59.679]  He has hit the unknown.
[02:38:00.139 --> 02:38:02.142]  Literally.
[02:38:02.422 --> 02:38:03.463]  Just think about it for a moment.
[02:38:03.563 --> 02:38:10.352]  Even Russia, in their super deep wells to 40,230 feet, they did not hit this oil pressure.
[02:38:10.872 --> 02:38:12.334]  This is the unknown.
[02:38:12.514 --> 02:38:14.477]  They don't know what to take of it.
[02:38:15.118 --> 02:38:17.701]  And a lot of even they themselves are guessing.
[02:38:19.244 --> 02:38:21.285]  Well, I just want to say this before we take a final call.
[02:38:21.485 --> 02:38:22.986]  I am humbled by all the listeners.
[02:38:23.066 --> 02:38:24.546]  I'm humbled by everyone's support.
[02:38:24.966 --> 02:38:32.870]  I'm humbled by people calling in and asking me questions because somebody asked me about the Federal Reserve or the Second Amendment or the New World Order.
[02:38:33.911 --> 02:38:35.713]  Or Queen Beatrix or the Bilderberg Group.
[02:38:36.133 --> 02:38:37.474]  I can, you know, comment on that.
[02:38:37.894 --> 02:38:42.338]  And I actually have done a little bit of study in oil wells and hydrology and drilling.
[02:38:43.038 --> 02:38:45.961]  But, you know, again, the government doesn't know.
[02:38:46.701 --> 02:38:47.762]  BP doesn't know.
[02:38:48.503 --> 02:38:52.626]  And all they know how to do is put new taxes on us and take more of our freedoms.
[02:38:53.547 --> 02:38:55.589]  And now Hillary Clinton's on the Drudge Report.
[02:38:56.664 --> 02:39:00.309]  Obama administration to sue Arizona over immigration law.
[02:39:00.889 --> 02:39:03.512]  So, more treason on that front.
[02:39:04.153 --> 02:39:06.516]  Let's take one final call and we'll let Lindsey Williams go.
[02:39:06.957 --> 02:39:08.679]  George in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[02:39:10.054 --> 02:39:10.554]  Hi, Lindsey.
[02:39:10.974 --> 02:39:12.695]  I have three quick questions.
[02:39:12.955 --> 02:39:24.279]  One, with some of the secret technology that we have, drilling tunnels through the United States for trains or whatever they talk about on various other shows, why can't they use something like that?
[02:39:24.319 --> 02:39:29.180]  The other question is, is there any way we can stop these people with their carbon tax?
[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:34.382]  What ways can we sabotage their plans for 2010 or whatever date they have?
[02:39:34.882 --> 02:39:38.344]  And lastly, this seems suicidal because the Chinese are waiting on the side.
[02:39:38.364 --> 02:39:39.704]  I lived in Asia for a long time.
[02:39:40.103 --> 02:39:46.528]  And they're just waiting for us to knock ourselves off so they can just pick up the pieces while we're flat on our back.
[02:39:46.568 --> 02:39:54.335]  And if these idiots pull off this plan, basically they're going to just pounce on us after we jackass ourselves into a corner.
[02:39:55.016 --> 02:40:00.620]  Well, it is true the world's a very serious, dangerous place and the elites we have are out of control and arrogant.
[02:40:01.641 --> 02:40:07.026]  And some of it was declassified in the fifties that they had nuclear-powered giant
[02:40:08.348 --> 02:40:37.347]  underground tunneling machines uh... that could uh... you know in some cases what i read was tunnel up to a half mile a day depending on what type of rock they're going through but normally they drill those tunnels just a few hundred feet under the ground they're all over austin they're out of the old bergstrom because it was the former sack command base they go out to fort hood uh... there are underground bases and and uh... that's part of the continuity of government program uh... most of it's secret but we know the program exists
[02:40:38.107 --> 02:40:38.348]  I don't
[02:40:58.550 --> 02:41:03.013]  Just like there's pressure involved with water on top of you, there's pressure when you're underground.
[02:41:03.033 --> 02:41:25.968]  I mean, they've got mile-deep mines in South Africa, I've seen film footage of, where it's 150 degrees, and they've got giant air conditioners they lower down, and even with those huge air conditioners that move with the miners, mining diamonds and gold, it's still 115 degrees, and they've got to stand right in front of the air conditioner, with it 150 degrees, five feet away from them.
[02:41:26.568 --> 02:41:29.351]  Hacking out giant diamonds and gold.
[02:41:29.831 --> 02:41:33.194]  I mean, so again, man is not all-powerful.
[02:41:33.254 --> 02:41:34.175]  Man is not God.
[02:41:34.235 --> 02:41:36.397]  We can barely go a mile down to get diamonds.
[02:41:36.737 --> 02:41:37.457]  Lindsey Williams.
[02:41:38.739 --> 02:41:45.825]  Nothing is going to stop the elitist timeline of 2012 except the providence of God.
[02:41:45.845 --> 02:41:51.890]  I highly recommend you call on him on a regular basis and ask for his assistance.
[02:41:52.654 --> 02:42:02.124]  Well, I also highly recommend people get your DVD set, breaking down all this, and the latest audio CD, and give that toll-free number and website out again one more time.
[02:42:02.144 --> 02:42:02.724]  Lindsey Williams.
[02:42:02.925 --> 02:42:05.968]  Toll-free numbers, operator standing by right now.
[02:42:06.188 --> 02:42:09.311]  Please copy these documentaries and give them out.
[02:42:09.371 --> 02:42:10.573]  They are not copywritten.
[02:42:10.653 --> 02:42:11.974]  My toll-free number is 888.
[02:42:14.206 --> 02:42:17.548]  799-6111 or go on the web to prophecyclub.com.
[02:42:30.416 --> 02:42:31.297]  I like that.
[02:42:31.357 --> 02:42:40.621]  I don't oftentimes say things to you too much because you and I, all of us are in this business together, but I have such a great admiration for what you're doing.
[02:42:41.221 --> 02:42:42.662]  I appreciate you immensely.
[02:42:43.102 --> 02:42:48.765]  You are reaching audiences that nobody else in America is reaching in a way that nobody else is doing it.
[02:42:49.245 --> 02:42:53.569]  And I just say, God bless you, the real God, the true and living God of the Bible.
[02:42:53.970 --> 02:42:57.373]  And keep up the great work you're doing, and I have a great admiration for you.
[02:42:57.413 --> 02:43:01.978]  And everybody out there, you listen to Alex Jones every day, and don't you miss a single program.
[02:43:02.779 --> 02:43:05.600]  Lindsay, I appreciate what you're doing as well and God bless you.
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:17.804]  We're all trying to reach people together and just to question the system and try to somehow prepare ourselves as this world gets crazier and crazier and we can't do it without God and you're absolutely right at the end of the day to put it at God's feet.
[02:43:18.124 --> 02:43:26.347]  As long as we do the right thing and just count on God, I know I have faith that God will come through for us as a civilization, as a society.
[02:43:26.647 --> 02:43:28.688]  We'll talk to you again next week with another update.
[02:43:28.728 --> 02:43:29.748]  Lindsay Williams, thank you.
[02:43:30.388 --> 02:43:30.889]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:43:30.929 --> 02:43:31.529]  Have a great day.
[02:43:31.929 --> 02:43:32.249]  You bet.
[02:43:32.850 --> 02:43:34.271]  I said I'd do 20 minutes of overdrive.
[02:43:34.291 --> 02:43:35.772]  We did 44 minutes of overdrive.
[02:43:35.792 --> 02:43:42.658]  I want to say great job to my crew, to the Genesis Network, to the folks that make InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com possible.
[02:43:43.019 --> 02:43:45.161]  I'll be back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:43:45.281 --> 02:43:49.604]  Central, at InfoWars.com and on your local AM and FM dial.
[02:43:50.814 --> 02:44:01.137]  Whatever we do, we know a carbon tax and more taxes on the American people and our faltering industry is not going to fix this problem in the Gulf, and so we have that fight to deal with.
[02:44:01.597 --> 02:44:03.698]  Until next time, sayonara.
[02:44:03.878 --> 02:44:04.999]  Alex Jones, signing off.
[02:44:18.115 --> 02:44:23.958]  She came on like a diva, I had to touch and ease her, enjoy a little paradise.
[02:44:24.118 --> 02:44:30.661]  The luck was in my pocket, we're losing it to rocket, she never knew the reason why.
