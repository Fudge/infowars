[00:00:00.547 --> 00:00:03.388]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:12.492 --> 00:00:13.353]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:17.775]  We are now eight minutes into this second hour on this Friday edition.
[00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:27.279]  We've got a key article up at InfoWars.com titled, Top Ten Problems with Assassinating
[00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:30.238]  American citizens.
[00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:33.300]  The government says it can assassinate U.S.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.840]  citizens.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:46.188]  I remember five years ago seeing a Jerusalem Post article, then a UPI article, and then a Reuters story where Israel said that they would kill American citizens inside the U.S.
[00:00:46.228 --> 00:00:47.589]  and I thought that was pretty shocking.
[00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:50.176]  They were connected to Alciada.
[00:00:50.257 --> 00:00:56.198]  Now our own government says, abroad or domestically, they will send in hit teams to kill whoever they want.
[00:00:56.598 --> 00:01:04.080]  No judge, no jury, no getting sent to Guantanamo Bay and tortured for six, seven, eight years, and then put on a kangaroo trial.
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.781]  Now they'll just kill you.
[00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:10.022]  I want to get more into that coming up today.
[00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:17.586]  And how it dovetails with this complete federal takeover of our society that's happening.
[00:01:17.987 --> 00:01:22.730]  Again, Obama has appointed this 10-member gubernatorial board.
[00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.730]  Bush started this.
[00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:27.613]  Again, seamless integration with Homeland Security.
[00:01:28.153 --> 00:01:30.375]  We pointed out when we were leaked the MIAC report.
[00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:34.510]  We were leaked a California report and a Missouri report.
[00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.552]  For some reason, the Missouri report got all the attention.
[00:01:39.592 --> 00:01:40.972]  Then we were leaked the federal report.
[00:01:42.412 --> 00:01:46.454]  Where Homeland Security and NORTHCOM are set up for the American people.
[00:01:46.494 --> 00:01:47.534]  We are seen as the enemy.
[00:01:47.614 --> 00:01:50.055]  We are the people that this is designed for.
[00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:53.796]  Because the foreign banks taking over our country know what they're doing is criminal.
[00:01:55.766 --> 00:02:08.554]  And we pointed out that the earlier version of that same coded MIAC report, the same code number, had been issued in April of 2008, before Obama even got into office.
[00:02:09.414 --> 00:02:11.816]  So it was Bush's people doing that.
[00:02:12.336 --> 00:02:14.337]  But the neocons picked it up and spun it.
[00:02:14.817 --> 00:02:23.983]  So this Governor's Council was started by Bush, Obama expanded it with an executive order, has now ceded it to quote, work with the states to counter terrorism.
[00:02:25.253 --> 00:02:36.459]  And the governor that put out the first MIAC report, which is a mirror of the federal report, Governor Nixon is the head of that subsection of the Governor's Council for Homeland Security.
[00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.842]  And so we're going to be, again, breaking that down today.
[00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:47.745]  We have some excellent articles from last month that detail all this, but we now know who the Governor's Council is made up of.
[00:02:47.805 --> 00:02:49.786]  Again, we'll cover that next hour, exactly who these people are.
[00:02:50.896 --> 00:02:54.237]  Obama expands federal power over the states with executive order.
[00:02:54.317 --> 00:02:56.198]  Kurt Nemo, Infowars.com.
[00:02:57.498 --> 00:03:00.339]  We have another key report here from Prison Planet.
[00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.539]  Paul Joseph Watson, PDD 51.
[00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.060]  A new executive order.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.201]  Give Obama dictator power.
[00:03:09.727 --> 00:03:13.670]  Last roadblocks to martial law United States eliminated.
[00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.733]  And we have the cyber security boss again resigning last year saying the Pentagon is taking over the web.
[00:03:20.054 --> 00:03:24.697]  And then we get the secret treaty that Obama is saying he's going to sign with the UN.
[00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:28.279]  This is official news as of three months ago, but was only in a few newspapers.
[00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:29.280]  Just massive.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:39.287]  Import, but the average person doesn't even know, saying they do plan to ratchet down and shut down the web and make you have an ID to get on the web and track everything you're doing.
[00:03:39.747 --> 00:03:41.969]  China doesn't even make you have a web ID.
[00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.093]  They just filter and block most things with Microsoft technology that Bill Gates had put in there.
[00:03:48.414 --> 00:03:54.098]  Now, of course, it comes out what we reported five years ago with our CIA source, Steele.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.541]  Mr. Steele, we need to get him back on.
[00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:08.309]  And in that report that came out in the Washington Post on Wednesday,
[00:04:09.517 --> 00:04:11.237]  In fact, I've got it here in my stack.
[00:04:11.337 --> 00:04:15.158]  Google to enlist NSA to help it ward off cyber attacks.
[00:04:15.178 --> 00:04:15.898]  That's the spin.
[00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:20.619]  But five years ago, Google moved in with NASA at a research facility.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.400]  They're putting in the control grids.
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.420]  Yahoo's involved.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.642]  No one is involved as much as Microsoft in all of this as well.
[00:04:33.582 --> 00:04:35.523]  So we need to ask the question,
[00:04:36.813 --> 00:04:41.861]  As citizens, are we going to allow ourselves to become like China?
[00:04:42.562 --> 00:04:49.752]  Are we going to let this control grid be put in place to take over our society?
[00:04:49.792 --> 00:04:51.495]  That is a very important question to ask.
[00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:56.201]  And we'll be discussing it coming up in the next hour.
[00:04:56.982 --> 00:05:01.285]  Right now we're joined by Damon Vickers of Nine Points Capital Partners.
[00:05:01.305 --> 00:05:03.446]  The website is www.nps.us.
[00:05:15.986 --> 00:05:36.090]  And of course he's a big pundit all over national television for major publications and Damon Vickers is one of the very few who has successfully navigated both bull and bear markets profitably over the last 25 years as clients and investment partners have invested.
[00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.772]  In a who's who of some of the best performing stocks the last two decades.
[00:05:41.092 --> 00:05:45.694]  Companies like Cisco Systems, Starbucks Coffee, and Amazon.com to name a few.
[00:05:46.414 --> 00:05:49.275]  Damon called the top of the equities market in 2000 and 2008.
[00:05:50.435 --> 00:05:56.258]  During the worst market year since 1987, one of his funds had a 63% returns.
[00:05:56.978 --> 00:06:02.980]  It says Damon's trend following approach allows him to embrace both up and down markets equally.
[00:06:06.348 --> 00:06:12.730]  Fluid investment styles resulted in him consistently being named one of the top money managers in the country.
[00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.172]  And again, he's with, and heads up, npm.us.
[00:06:18.192 --> 00:06:20.893]  I was having a dyslexic moment there.
[00:06:21.473 --> 00:06:22.933]  Damon, it's good to have you back on with us.
[00:06:23.193 --> 00:06:24.954]  Hey, good to be with you as well, Alex.
[00:06:25.094 --> 00:06:26.414]  Good morning, good afternoon to everybody.
[00:06:26.795 --> 00:06:28.015]  Where do you join us from today?
[00:06:28.995 --> 00:06:31.216]  We're in the beautiful island of Kauai.
[00:06:32.401 --> 00:06:40.666]  Out near Haina, and we've got a nice house here right on the ocean, and it's a pretty nice day today.
[00:06:42.086 --> 00:06:42.907]  Wish I was there.
[00:06:42.947 --> 00:06:44.508]  I've never gotten to go to Hawaii.
[00:06:44.568 --> 00:06:46.369]  I'm too busy here in the info bunker.
[00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:47.729]  Oh, I know, and I know.
[00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:54.353]  Well, if you've been here about, I guess, three weeks ago, we could have hung out with Julia Roberts and her kids.
[00:06:54.393 --> 00:06:54.793]  Really?
[00:06:54.993 --> 00:06:56.254]  She just bought the house next door.
[00:06:57.312 --> 00:06:57.372]  Wow!
[00:06:57.392 --> 00:06:58.233]  That would be really cool!
[00:06:58.253 --> 00:06:59.154]  That would be neat!
[00:07:17.186 --> 00:07:22.310]  I'd be forced to draw off the vaporizing hookah.
[00:07:22.831 --> 00:07:23.271]  I know it.
[00:07:23.671 --> 00:07:24.792]  I could just imagine it.
[00:07:24.912 --> 00:07:25.313]  I know it.
[00:07:25.433 --> 00:07:25.813]  I know it.
[00:07:25.853 --> 00:07:29.936]  Yeah, it's probably something we should talk about today, actually, at some point.
[00:07:29.976 --> 00:07:33.639]  All the push for medical marijuana to keep everybody all doped up.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.060]  Yeah.
[00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:40.982]  Now, you know, I may disagree with you on that, because the government's pushing Ritalin, Prozac, all these really toxic things.
[00:07:41.362 --> 00:07:44.764]  I know people abuse marijuana, but I don't see marijuana as bad as alcohol.
[00:07:45.424 --> 00:07:48.466]  I guess you're against marijuana decriminalization?
[00:07:49.226 --> 00:07:49.446]  No.
[00:07:49.607 --> 00:07:50.687]  No, I'm not.
[00:07:51.147 --> 00:07:58.431]  I don't think the government should probably actively preclude anybody from doing hardly anything.
[00:07:58.471 --> 00:07:59.712]  However, as a society,
[00:08:00.587 --> 00:08:11.337]  The medication, the medicating ourselves, whether it be through Paxil or Depakote or Aleve, or smoking pot all day, is just really the wrong direction.
[00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:13.959]  I think not only for individuals, but as a nation.
[00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.421]  And it dulls the mind, it dulls the senses.
[00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:26.387]  And it does not allow, I would argue, that excessive use of marijuana doesn't help a person really focus, really.
[00:08:26.567 --> 00:08:28.709]  And they're just kind of lazy and lethargic.
[00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:36.893]  No, I've seen a lot of zombie... We've got a real problem with non-motivation in this country, as it is in most of the Western nations.
[00:08:36.913 --> 00:08:44.798]  And so I think medicating with Paxil, Depakote, Aleve, and increasingly marijuana, I don't think, or alcohol, doesn't really do anything to help us.
[00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:53.123]  Well, I agree with you, and I do know a lot of zombie potheads, but I also know a lot of people that smoke it sparingly who are, you know, great professionals.
[00:08:53.483 --> 00:09:01.308]  My issue is, I don't want to pay to put them in prison, and I know the government and big banks have been caught controlling the drug trade and laundering the money for a long time.
[00:09:01.628 --> 00:09:01.828]  Good.
[00:09:01.948 --> 00:09:03.149]  I definitely agree with that.
[00:09:03.169 --> 00:09:14.155]  You know, they're putting people in prison because they drink too much alcohol or too much pot or whatever other adventures they may find themselves doing.
[00:09:14.195 --> 00:09:15.036]  I don't think that makes any sense.
[00:09:16.581 --> 00:09:22.224]  All right, Damon, the reason we've got you on today is because you are a very successful financial trends forecaster and expert.
[00:09:22.244 --> 00:09:24.966]  We want to pick your brain, and we're going to go to break here in a moment.
[00:09:24.986 --> 00:09:28.347]  We've got a few minutes here, so I want to go ahead and throw this out.
[00:09:28.988 --> 00:09:34.551]  We're seeing reports where they're talking about bankruptcy for the United States is now certain.
[00:09:35.111 --> 00:09:40.514]  We've got George Soros basically calling a plunge in gold last week.
[00:09:40.875 --> 00:09:44.277]  We have central banks going in trying to prop up the dollar, drive down gold.
[00:09:44.357 --> 00:09:44.657]  Why?
[00:09:45.237 --> 00:09:48.459]  We have CNBC reporting market crash if U.S.
[00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:50.701]  policies continue.
[00:09:51.501 --> 00:09:54.763]  So we have all this volatility, stocks plunging yesterday.
[00:09:55.103 --> 00:09:57.005]  What is causing all of this, Damon Vickers?
[00:09:58.045 --> 00:09:59.426]  Well, we've got a number of things going on.
[00:10:00.026 --> 00:10:04.029]  Critically, you know, we started this off talking about marijuana.
[00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.591]  But how does that relate to the whole picture here?
[00:10:06.651 --> 00:10:08.673]  You've got a lot of the world, Alex.
[00:10:08.773 --> 00:10:13.256]  The United States, Western Europe, Greece, Portugal, Spain, the UK.
[00:10:13.296 --> 00:10:18.199]  The debt that is out there is just ginormous.
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:28.086]  And the ability to borrow money has delayed a lot of people pursuing jobs, let alone the 99 weeks of unemployment that people can now get under the Obama administration.
[00:10:28.869 --> 00:10:30.711]  So, the issues right now are debt.
[00:10:30.891 --> 00:10:32.493]  A tremendous amount of debt on the planet.
[00:10:32.873 --> 00:10:34.415]  The lack of creation of jobs.
[00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:43.244]  It's looking like that in this latest downturn since 2007, we lost about 8.5 million jobs.
[00:10:43.304 --> 00:10:45.346]  This just came out from the Labor Department.
[00:10:46.711 --> 00:10:52.833]  The unemployment rate dipped a little bit today in the numbers that came out today, but it's still looking kind of dour.
[00:10:53.413 --> 00:10:56.914]  And a lot of those jobs, Alex, I don't think a lot of those jobs are ever going to come back.
[00:10:57.174 --> 00:11:05.816]  They're in industries that were overbuilt, like the construction industry, like the distribution of credit industry and the mortgage industry.
[00:11:06.116 --> 00:11:09.757]  I don't think those jobs are coming back for a long time, and I don't know what else those people can do.
[00:11:10.377 --> 00:11:12.278]  It has been hitting the gold market a little bit.
[00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:16.040]  However, the trend for gold is still up, even with this pullback.
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.722]  I know it's hard to endure, but it is.
[00:11:19.562 --> 00:11:26.186]  Should nations, we can talk about that and whether or not that becomes a liquidation point to raise assets as a store of value, and that could happen.
[00:11:26.587 --> 00:11:28.688]  And really, it's the recovery of what?
[00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:31.089]  So, really, it is about jobs.
[00:11:31.589 --> 00:11:39.374]  It is about jobs in the world and productivity and making Europeans and European nations on the planet productive people.
[00:11:40.106 --> 00:11:43.008]  All right, stay there, David Vickers.
[00:11:43.408 --> 00:11:44.249]  Stay there, gotta break.
[00:11:44.309 --> 00:11:46.790]  He is the head of Nine Points Capital Partners.
[00:11:47.291 --> 00:11:48.512]  The website is nnpm.us.
[00:11:48.532 --> 00:11:49.692]  Our site's infowars.com.
[00:11:58.072 --> 00:12:02.333]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:12:02.694 --> 00:12:10.216]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.

[00:12:57.452 --> 00:13:07.194]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:13:07.474 --> 00:13:13.516]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:13:13.916 --> 00:13:22.758]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:13:23.158 --> 00:13:32.070]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.916]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:13:36.936 --> 00:13:38.498]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:13:38.759 --> 00:13:41.262]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[00:16:14.802 --> 00:16:18.704]  Damon Vickers is our guest.
[00:16:18.724 --> 00:16:22.845]  A very, very successful trends forecaster, researcher.
[00:16:22.885 --> 00:16:25.126]  He heads up Nine Points Capital Partners.
[00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:26.547]  Okay, this is a short segment.
[00:16:26.567 --> 00:16:27.787]  Getting right back to you, Damon.
[00:16:28.147 --> 00:16:28.908]  You are getting into...
[00:16:30.308 --> 00:16:34.809]  Why the stock market's plunging, what's happening with gold, where you see this economy.
[00:16:34.849 --> 00:16:37.230]  They're already talking about another stimulus.
[00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.551]  The jobless numbers are exploding.
[00:16:40.031 --> 00:16:44.012]  We have Pennsylvania on the verge of bankruptcy, California.
[00:16:44.413 --> 00:16:50.194]  They're now talking about raiding pension funds, taking people's pensions and the government managing it.
[00:16:50.755 --> 00:16:51.975]  I mean, this does not look pretty.
[00:16:52.796 --> 00:16:53.756]  No, it doesn't.
[00:16:53.836 --> 00:16:59.758]  But I mean, it comes back to productivity and the United States being a going concern.
[00:16:59.798 --> 00:17:03.480]  You opened up the show at the beginning and it was talking about, well, the United States bankrupt.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]  Yeah, we're bankrupt.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.841]  The United States has been bankrupt for years.
[00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:18.025]  You may draw some comfort, though, I suppose, that it's not just us, that it's also the United Kingdom, it's Greece, it's Portugal, it's Spain, it's a lot of Western Europe as well.
[00:17:18.645 --> 00:17:20.145]  When we went off
[00:17:22.419 --> 00:17:26.703]  Uh, currency's actually representing anything and we fired up the printing presses.
[00:17:27.143 --> 00:17:32.427]  We have just printed and printed and printed and printed more money and more money and more money.
[00:17:33.108 --> 00:17:41.194]  And the planet as a whole has all bought into this game of he who has the most monopoly money wins.
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.060]  Yeah.
[00:17:57.027 --> 00:18:19.737]  Uh, and, uh, you know, our relationship to debt has been a very huge problem, and it's enabled, like the Paxil-Defico belief, that debt has also medicated us, not unlike the way those things have medicated us and given us the false sense of prosperity and the illusion that everything is okay, when things are really not okay.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:25.185]  And so, you know, we talk about the bankruptcy of the United States as being a bad thing.
[00:18:26.286 --> 00:18:31.673]  Maybe the ultimate bankruptcy of the United States is the best thing that could possibly happen.
[00:18:31.853 --> 00:18:35.457]  And perhaps we should hasten its arrival and build from there.
[00:18:37.321 --> 00:18:57.914]  But Damon, isn't the key to this, though, if we have a bankruptcy and the same systems are then continued after that, the big central banks and the players at the top are going to get even more control and power and continue using the central banks to give themselves insider knowledge and unlimited funding?
[00:18:58.955 --> 00:19:00.636]  Well, their funding of what, Alex?
[00:19:00.756 --> 00:19:02.177]  I mean, their controlling of what?
[00:19:02.257 --> 00:19:03.157]  World currency.
[00:19:03.738 --> 00:19:05.719]  They're playing the same game that everybody else is.
[00:19:07.517 --> 00:19:13.100]  But haven't they already pre-positioned themselves with the fiat currency when it still had value to buy real assets?
[00:19:14.281 --> 00:19:19.344]  What value do the real assets really have if you can't exchange it to anything?
[00:19:21.725 --> 00:19:27.949]  What would be the real asset that you would think that they would own that would have so much value that gives them an advantage over you?
[00:19:28.429 --> 00:19:28.629]  What?
[00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.431]  Large defense contractors.
[00:19:31.451 --> 00:19:35.773]  They take over the global monetary system and then they basically enslave us.
[00:19:36.013 --> 00:19:36.654]  We're already there.
[00:19:40.752 --> 00:19:42.153]  I don't know what their victory is.
[00:19:42.714 --> 00:19:45.456]  And if they totally wreck us all financially... Well, they want the next bubble.
[00:19:45.496 --> 00:19:46.717]  They want the carbon tax.
[00:19:46.937 --> 00:19:54.243]  I mean, they've said, yes, we run you, yes, it's world government, yes, the bankers rule you, and you're now going to pay us carbon taxes.
[00:19:54.623 --> 00:19:55.383]  But that's failing.
[00:19:56.184 --> 00:19:58.546]  Yeah, that is common glue, too, as well.
[00:19:59.235 --> 00:20:01.457]  Well, there's a lot of debt out there.
[00:20:01.497 --> 00:20:04.279]  The job growth is the problem.
[00:20:04.859 --> 00:20:13.305]  You and I were going back and forth on jobs, and it's hard to get a lot of the world productive.
[00:20:14.706 --> 00:20:16.547]  It's hard to get people to be productive.
[00:20:16.907 --> 00:20:27.735]  It seems often in most organizations that we need to put $5 of effort and of money into a person to even get a dollar of output.
[00:20:28.422 --> 00:20:33.145]  And I would say that that's the case of a lot of workers, particularly in the United States.
[00:20:34.406 --> 00:20:44.271]  So you're saying the planet, the industrialized world, is a bunch of TV-watching couch potatoes who just want everything for free.
[00:20:44.311 --> 00:20:56.659]  And I agree, it's not just the corrupt elite that have facilitated this, it is the sloth-like zombies that have played right into their hands, and now the elite are going to use the sloth zombies to rob the middle class.
[00:20:58.408 --> 00:20:58.808]  I don't know.
[00:20:58.868 --> 00:21:01.850]  I don't know that there's much value there either, Alex.
[00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.673]  Most of the middle class all leveraged themselves up to the eyeball.
[00:21:05.753 --> 00:21:07.094]  They're pretty much wiped out.
[00:21:07.955 --> 00:21:12.498]  The smarter people, the people that have always had money, they didn't go into much debt.
[00:21:12.918 --> 00:21:14.799]  They didn't pay cash for things.
[00:21:14.819 --> 00:21:15.720]  I don't have any debt!
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.301]  Well, there you go.
[00:21:18.642 --> 00:21:20.403]  All of us can't be as rich as you, Alex.
[00:21:20.903 --> 00:21:21.944]  I'm not that rich.
[00:21:22.064 --> 00:21:25.346]  I mean, I try to be a good steward to run my operation, but...
[00:21:27.588 --> 00:21:30.370]  I mean, I just don't really go into debt, except for maybe a house.
[00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.992]  Hey, you see, that's your personality.
[00:21:33.032 --> 00:21:42.459]  Your personality, I mean, what I get from you, and the brief times that we've known one another, is that you're really about focusing soberly and clearly at issues.
[00:21:42.479 --> 00:21:42.940]  Well, stay there.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.901]  Let's come back and talk about... As you're willing to look at them.
[00:21:45.442 --> 00:21:46.002]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:48.004 --> 00:21:48.924]  We're on the march.
[00:21:49.405 --> 00:21:51.006]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:51.927 --> 00:21:54.629]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:57.062 --> 00:22:01.284]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:22:01.604 --> 00:22:02.224]  Number one.
[00:22:02.524 --> 00:22:05.685]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:22:05.946 --> 00:22:06.506]  Number two.
[00:22:06.806 --> 00:22:11.348]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:22:11.688 --> 00:22:12.148]  It's true.
[00:22:12.448 --> 00:22:16.990]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:17.851]  Number 3.
[00:22:18.131 --> 00:22:21.414]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:22:21.714 --> 00:22:25.457]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:22:25.638 --> 00:22:26.178]  Number 4.
[00:22:26.438 --> 00:22:28.800]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:32.584]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:22:32.884 --> 00:22:33.084]  Number 5.
[00:22:33.665 --> 00:22:37.588]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:22:37.809 --> 00:22:42.573]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:22:42.853 --> 00:22:46.899]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:22:47.019 --> 00:22:48.602]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:22:48.822 --> 00:22:50.905]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:22:57.469 --> 00:23:00.071]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:23:00.491 --> 00:23:05.455]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:23:05.815 --> 00:23:07.556]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:23:07.857 --> 00:23:12.680]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.821]  How much do you want?
[00:23:14.041 --> 00:23:14.802]  When do you want it?
[00:23:15.182 --> 00:23:16.763]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:23:17.064 --> 00:23:17.884]  When will you need it?
[00:23:18.124 --> 00:23:20.206]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:23:20.326 --> 00:23:21.447]  Will there be any food?
[00:23:21.667 --> 00:23:22.988]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:23:23.188 --> 00:23:28.252]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:23:28.452 --> 00:23:31.654]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:23:32.034 --> 00:23:35.537]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:23:35.857 --> 00:23:36.838]  How much will you need?
[00:23:37.098 --> 00:23:37.699]  We don't know.
[00:23:37.979 --> 00:23:38.899]  How much do you want?
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:39.820]  All you can get.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:40.821]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:23:41.101 --> 00:23:43.884]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:23:44.164 --> 00:23:46.347]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:23:46.367 --> 00:23:47.368]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:23:56.477 --> 00:24:00.480]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.322]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:24:03.462 --> 00:24:04.703]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:24:04.723 --> 00:24:05.403]  It's very real.
[00:24:05.543 --> 00:24:07.665]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:24:07.785 --> 00:24:09.306]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:24:09.446 --> 00:24:13.789]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:16.191]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:24:16.471 --> 00:24:22.277]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[00:24:22.497 --> 00:24:27.222]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:24:27.282 --> 00:24:30.025]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:24:30.105 --> 00:24:32.728]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:24:32.848 --> 00:24:34.189]  This system is free of chemicals.
[00:24:34.209 --> 00:24:34.609]  I think so.
[00:25:00.444 --> 00:25:02.245]  Okay, Damon Vickers is our guest.
[00:25:02.265 --> 00:25:10.230]  I'm Alex Jones, and he was getting into some points about what he thinks my mindset is or my focus when we had to go to break.
[00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:16.374]  Finish up, Damon, and then I've got a bunch of questions for you and a whole bunch of Twitter questions that have come in as well.
[00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:16.714]  Go ahead.
[00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:34.370]  No, my comment about you, which I'm not going to make comments about you, I mean, but it seems that you are someone who looks at things very soberly, and you accept the good news, the bad news, the freckles, the wars, the whatever, but you don't delude yourself, which is uncommon.
[00:25:35.471 --> 00:25:36.112]  And good to see you.
[00:25:36.132 --> 00:25:37.093]  I'm glad you're on the radio.
[00:25:39.517 --> 00:25:57.953]  Well, we've got you here, and we appreciate your valuable time away from your family to really discuss where this is going, because I see all these big central bankers saying, we're in danger of another collapse, a bigger collapse, currencies worldwide are going down overall, and the joblessness is increasing.
[00:25:57.993 --> 00:26:01.756]  I mean, we keep talking about that, but how do you see this unfolding?
[00:26:01.776 --> 00:26:07.681]  I mean, what preparations are you making in all of your billions in portfolios out there to protect your investors?
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:15.323]  Well, one thing we've been doing is lightening up, and recently we've been lightening up and lessening our commitment to the market.
[00:26:15.843 --> 00:26:19.805]  If we roll over and we start headed down, we're going to start shorting the market.
[00:26:20.085 --> 00:26:21.065]  And we'll start shorting.
[00:26:21.085 --> 00:26:23.366]  We've got a number of issues that look like they're setting up.
[00:26:23.806 --> 00:26:27.308]  I'll be watching how they close today on the close on a Friday.
[00:26:28.148 --> 00:26:32.630]  If they close weak on some of them, I may go out on the day short a number of issues.
[00:26:34.191 --> 00:26:36.292]  However, the trend may still be up, so I'm not going to
[00:26:37.941 --> 00:26:40.863]  I'm not going to try to have too much of a bias one way or the other.
[00:26:41.223 --> 00:26:52.588]  Yes, I do believe that the job creation is critical to our economic future and health and viability of the stock market, the economy, and I understand the relationship between job growth and innovation.
[00:26:52.608 --> 00:26:55.550]  But most of the new jobs are government.
[00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:57.311]  Most of the new jobs are government.
[00:26:57.995 --> 00:26:58.756]  A lot of the new jobs.
[00:26:58.776 --> 00:26:59.236]  That's right.
[00:26:59.416 --> 00:26:59.956]  Job growth.
[00:26:59.996 --> 00:27:02.719]  Consistently, there has been job growth in the government.
[00:27:03.099 --> 00:27:10.825]  And that is the growing tumor that we see overtaking the whole economy of bureaucracy and control and all of those things.
[00:27:11.185 --> 00:27:14.327]  So, if we do start rolling down, we will go short.
[00:27:14.427 --> 00:27:20.352]  And yes, in 2008, a year that was pretty apocalyptic, we had a fund that went up 63 percent.
[00:27:20.412 --> 00:27:21.432]  Our hedge funds did pretty good.
[00:27:21.452 --> 00:27:21.913]  That was nice.
[00:27:22.638 --> 00:27:29.884]  And in the last bear market, in 2000-2003, we also made a lot of money from those declines.
[00:27:30.044 --> 00:27:33.727]  I don't really have this love for bull markets versus bear markets.
[00:27:33.867 --> 00:27:35.469]  I really want what the market wants.
[00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:41.734]  And actually, in bear markets, we make more money than bull markets, because the markets fall faster than they rise because of fear.
[00:27:44.207 --> 00:27:47.090]  What it will inevitably mean is that we're the holder of all these assets.
[00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.291]  We'll have to see.
[00:27:48.311 --> 00:27:51.273]  The gold, people have been looking for a safe haven in gold.
[00:27:51.293 --> 00:27:53.015]  It's an area that we've been involved in.
[00:27:53.275 --> 00:27:57.599]  I think you really have to watch that roughly $1,000 level for gold.
[00:27:57.619 --> 00:27:59.521]  I think it's very probable that we are going to hit it.
[00:28:01.122 --> 00:28:02.343]  It doesn't matter whether we hit it.
[00:28:02.383 --> 00:28:05.606]  The question is whether or not we really break through it and broach through it.
[00:28:05.626 --> 00:28:08.569]  But it's not uncommon when you break out
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.962]  Which is what gold did when it broke through $1,000.
[00:28:11.322 --> 00:28:17.828]  It ran up to $1225 an ounce, I think, intraday, to come back and tap or cap on the other side.
[00:28:17.888 --> 00:28:19.369]  It happens almost all the time.
[00:28:20.851 --> 00:28:34.604]  So, I think, really, probably for those investors that don't own gold already, that as we pull back on top of this $1,000, that that may be an area that you may want to seek to get involved, if you haven't already gotten involved.
[00:28:35.553 --> 00:28:35.754]  Okay.
[00:28:47.922 --> 00:28:49.583]  And also be prepared to let it go, too.
[00:28:50.524 --> 00:28:53.226]  If you're proven wrong, you're going to have to pull the plug.
[00:28:53.246 --> 00:29:01.992]  You don't want to be owning it as it breaks through $1,900, $800, $700, and you're losing money, but you still have your belief that you're losing money.
[00:29:02.052 --> 00:29:09.317]  So you've got to be, I would say, to take a shot at it but also be willing to take it off.
[00:29:10.273 --> 00:29:37.238]  Alright, shifting gears in a big way, I wouldn't call you a globalist, a New World Order person, but you do run in those circles, you are one of the people who will be honest on the air and admit it's a world government, a New World Order, but I see their swine flu hoax imploding as a hoax, admittedly a hoax now, the EU admits it's a hoax, we have the head of that commission on just a few days ago, Wolfgang Wodarg, we have their
[00:29:38.138 --> 00:29:41.679]  Carbon tax hoax literally imploding on every front.
[00:29:42.019 --> 00:29:45.940]  New scandals dwarfing climate gate on a daily basis.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.121]  We have the big central banks in trouble, caught giving themselves the bailout money.
[00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:52.182]  That's falling apart.
[00:29:52.622 --> 00:29:57.663]  We have the globalization and big government being ridiculed at every level.
[00:29:58.935 --> 00:30:01.496]  So what do you see the elite doing?
[00:30:01.536 --> 00:30:05.798]  Because you're right to say we're already in a banking dictatorship.
[00:30:06.058 --> 00:30:10.400]  Our Congress has admitted, many congressmen and women, that the big banks run the country.
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:18.444]  But as the real power structure is identified more and more, just historically and trending forward into the future,
[00:30:19.626 --> 00:30:29.534]  If you were one of the Rothschilds or the Rockefellers or one of these big controllers, what would you be doing or what are you hearing they're planning to do?
[00:30:31.356 --> 00:30:32.917]  I don't know.
[00:30:33.177 --> 00:30:38.602]  I don't hear that they're planning.
[00:30:38.802 --> 00:30:39.763]  I don't hear plans.
[00:30:39.863 --> 00:30:43.646]  You mentioned about the swine flu.
[00:30:43.686 --> 00:30:48.890]  Last I heard, they wanted to do injections for a second time.
[00:30:49.859 --> 00:30:50.720]  I don't know.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:58.088]  My sense is that the global population issue is a real problem.
[00:30:58.969 --> 00:31:06.056]  And my sense is that we probably need some limits on that.
[00:31:06.076 --> 00:31:08.179]  So that may be an area that there's some involvement in.
[00:31:09.665 --> 00:31:10.346]  There you go.
[00:31:10.426 --> 00:31:17.349]  See, I was going to do a friendly economic interview because you can bring us a lot to the table and I don't think you're a bad guy.
[00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:23.052]  But you really, you bring up the big hot button issue yourself.
[00:31:24.013 --> 00:31:28.255]  You're saying the globalists are involved in population reduction.
[00:31:28.895 --> 00:31:31.957]  If I take what you say correctly, correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:31:32.778 --> 00:31:36.405]  And that it is a problem for the economy.
[00:31:36.445 --> 00:31:43.719]  I mean, we've aborted 50 million of our workforce in the last 35 years in the US, so we brought in 50 million foreigners.
[00:31:46.943 --> 00:31:53.226]  We brought in the 50 million farmers at Barnard, Alex, because we were unwilling to do the work that they're so willing to do.
[00:31:54.027 --> 00:31:55.487]  We don't want to actually work.
[00:31:55.507 --> 00:32:04.171]  You see, the hard focusing and the willingness to soberly look at issues and see things squarely as they are, that's the work that you do.
[00:32:04.572 --> 00:32:05.732]  That's the work that I do.
[00:32:05.792 --> 00:32:07.473]  But for most Americans,
[00:32:07.953 --> 00:32:18.155]  They're too busy taking Paxil, Depakote, Viagra, Advil, and smoking pot all day, and medicating themselves with debt to look at what the real issues are.
[00:32:18.195 --> 00:32:19.216]  And they only care about the Super Bowl!
[00:32:19.236 --> 00:32:26.577]  And they go into Home Depot and they get the Mexicans, or they have Italian restaurants with Mexicans, because the Americans are too good to do any work.
[00:32:27.917 --> 00:32:28.698]  We're too good for that.
[00:32:28.738 --> 00:32:30.278]  We're too good to work hard, apparently.
[00:32:30.595 --> 00:32:37.619]  Well, there is something to what you say, but I see a lot of really hard-working Americans who aren't the lazy Americans who are caught in the middle.
[00:32:37.639 --> 00:32:39.300]  You're pandering to your audience, Alex.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.302]  No, I mean, I know a lot of people working two, three jobs.
[00:32:44.183 --> 00:32:52.547]  Well, yeah, they're working two or three jobs because they've put together a lifestyle that's unsupportable with mortgage payments that are too high.
[00:32:52.668 --> 00:32:54.949]  And now they're trying to support something that's unsupportable.
[00:32:55.629 --> 00:32:58.691]  The United States system, as it is, is unsupportable.
[00:32:59.588 --> 00:33:03.810]  And there is not enough debt in the world to keep this beast rolling.
[00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:12.633]  As for the population issue, yes, the global population probably does need some regulation.
[00:33:12.673 --> 00:33:16.834]  The truth is, we should be regulating it ourselves.
[00:33:16.994 --> 00:33:19.595]  It is not right for people, for men,
[00:33:20.242 --> 00:33:23.665]  We've got population issues, we've got agriculture issues, we've got health issues.
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.883]  We'll see, Damon.
[00:33:40.403 --> 00:33:40.884]  Here we are.
[00:33:40.984 --> 00:33:43.326]  Because we've had two rambunctious interviews with each other.
[00:34:00.373 --> 00:34:02.394]  You know, the first interview I wasn't too hard on you.
[00:34:02.414 --> 00:34:05.175]  We just basically argued with each other the last interview.
[00:34:05.955 --> 00:34:09.636]  And I've got you here because I really want to understand the establishment view.
[00:34:09.656 --> 00:34:11.817]  And I think it's safe to say you're a member of the establishment.
[00:34:11.837 --> 00:34:14.798]  I mean, how much money has your fund managed over the years?
[00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:17.339]  Yeah, that's private information.
[00:34:17.359 --> 00:34:17.940]  But it's a lot?
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:20.661]  Probably a couple of dollars.
[00:34:21.201 --> 00:34:21.501]  Yeah.
[00:34:21.821 --> 00:34:29.404]  The point is, the point is, is that you do run in these circles, and every time I am around someone of your caliber,
[00:34:30.675 --> 00:34:32.517]  I don't have a disdain for the public.
[00:34:32.537 --> 00:34:35.179]  I have a disdain for the mindset of most people.
[00:34:56.288 --> 00:34:59.997]  A rebirth, a renewal, an evolution, really.
[00:35:00.097 --> 00:35:00.919]  Forget about a renewal.
[00:35:00.979 --> 00:35:01.420]  We need it.
[00:35:02.236 --> 00:35:04.557]  We need to evolve mentally.
[00:35:04.857 --> 00:35:11.939]  The whole world needs to click into gear and begin to perceive things differently than they currently do.
[00:35:11.959 --> 00:35:14.079]  Let me say this and then get your take.
[00:35:14.379 --> 00:35:20.881]  Look, I have disdain for people who are in debt and who their kids are on drugs and can't read and write.
[00:35:21.161 --> 00:35:26.842]  That's a lot of yuppies, not just poor people, who worship the Super Bowl and buy lottery tickets.
[00:35:29.483 --> 00:35:30.825]  I know a lot of good people.
[00:35:30.845 --> 00:35:32.347]  That's something to do, Alex.
[00:35:32.467 --> 00:35:33.168]  Okay, good, good.
[00:35:33.248 --> 00:35:35.591]  That's brave, going after the fourth spoke.
[00:35:35.691 --> 00:35:37.314]  Good for you.
[00:35:37.394 --> 00:35:38.455]  Okay, I'll go with that.
[00:35:39.056 --> 00:35:39.597]  Disdain.
[00:35:39.697 --> 00:35:42.881]  I think we should have compassion for them because they're enslaved.
[00:35:44.123 --> 00:35:45.605]  But let me finish the statement.
[00:35:46.553 --> 00:36:03.364]  But just because people are like children, the media, the culture has been geared for that, and I see the CPS, I see the government, I see the secret Homeland Security reports, where their main enemy is the hard-working rural and local business person and the producers.
[00:36:03.904 --> 00:36:14.891]  And so, I do see red-blooded Middle America, who are keeping this country afloat, being fed on by the elites and by the slob general public.
[00:36:15.191 --> 00:36:22.753]  Now, that's a different view, I think, than your overall view, though, because when I said, there are a lot of really hard-working, good people out there, you just said, oh, come on, you're pandering.
[00:36:22.813 --> 00:36:23.873]  I mean, what are you getting at?
[00:36:23.913 --> 00:36:30.895]  No, they're really- You hear- you hear- well, no, because that- when you start talking about America, you'll- I mean, I do a lot of interviews.
[00:36:31.415 --> 00:36:39.737]  And what you'll- what you'll- when I start talking like that, then what the host will usually do is start defending his audience, which is the general public, and do that one.
[00:36:40.117 --> 00:36:42.678]  Look, you've got- you do have people out there that are producers.
[00:36:43.106 --> 00:36:45.707]  You do have people that are hardworking, okay?
[00:36:45.727 --> 00:36:47.968]  I mean, I'm on vacation right now, but I'm doing this interview.
[00:36:48.208 --> 00:36:49.289]  I mean, I'm looking at the ocean.
[00:36:49.629 --> 00:36:51.650]  I could be out on the beach right now, but I'm still working.
[00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:52.490]  I'm still working with you.
[00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:52.710]  Sure.
[00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.690]  Okay.
[00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:58.032]  So there are people out there, not that it's me, but there are people out there that are hardworking.
[00:36:58.532 --> 00:36:59.373]  Here's the problem.
[00:36:59.413 --> 00:37:02.354]  The problem is that there's fewer and fewer of them.
[00:37:03.183 --> 00:37:06.307]  And that you've got less and less, quote, producers.
[00:37:06.647 --> 00:37:07.328]  You're a producer.
[00:37:07.548 --> 00:37:08.189]  I'm a producer.
[00:37:08.489 --> 00:37:11.673]  There are people that do run good businesses out there and do run good quality.
[00:37:11.833 --> 00:37:12.855]  Look at Apple Computers.
[00:37:12.895 --> 00:37:14.196]  I think they're doing a great job.
[00:37:14.617 --> 00:37:16.399]  Innovative, good technology.
[00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.951]  You're beating the pants off of Microsoft.
[00:37:20.031 --> 00:37:23.852]  I mean, Microsoft is sub-basement compared to some of the stuff that Apple's doing.
[00:37:23.912 --> 00:37:24.932]  I mean, obviously.
[00:37:25.733 --> 00:37:27.753]  But there's fewer and fewer of them.
[00:37:27.953 --> 00:37:32.235]  And at the same time, government is getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:37:32.655 --> 00:37:46.740]  And the government is exerting more and more control and wanting to take more and more from the producers, to a point that you're almost disincentivized to do any production whatsoever.
[00:37:47.182 --> 00:37:58.939]  Exactly, and when I look at the ultra-elites and their policy reports and what they're doing, they're taking our normal bad traits and force-feeding them like a cancer.
[00:37:59.921 --> 00:38:03.105]  They want us slovenly, they want us dependent, they want us weak.
[00:38:04.054 --> 00:38:05.455]  And so that's my issue.
[00:38:05.475 --> 00:38:10.076]  I mean, you're somebody with kind of an elitist, or what you call a reality-based perspective.
[00:38:10.156 --> 00:38:10.716]  I don't know.
[00:38:10.816 --> 00:38:12.117]  I kind of reject that, Alex.
[00:38:12.237 --> 00:38:14.477]  I mean, I don't really get that.
[00:38:14.517 --> 00:38:25.241]  I mean, if you're talking about any of these people, I think there's a desire, I think, to positively influence global change.
[00:38:26.207 --> 00:38:34.493]  And when we saw pictures in recent weeks of Haiti, our initial response on the Haiti issue is, you know, oh my God, look at the poor, suffering Haiti people.
[00:38:35.254 --> 00:38:36.955]  Haiti has been suffering for decades.
[00:38:37.775 --> 00:38:40.918]  Their population has grown 50% in the last decade.
[00:38:40.938 --> 00:38:42.179]  They're pushing 10 million.
[00:38:42.439 --> 00:38:45.201]  They eat mud pies on the street.
[00:38:45.221 --> 00:38:48.283]  Soon they'll be pushing 15 million and 20 million.
[00:38:48.783 --> 00:38:52.186]  And if we push it far enough out, the Haitians are going to be eating each other!
[00:38:53.263 --> 00:38:56.505]  Argentina is a good parallel to the U.S.
[00:39:15.922 --> 00:39:25.106]  Well, we need to be self-supporting and self-sustaining and have structures of... But that's the issue!
[00:39:25.206 --> 00:39:31.869]  When you read what the globalists say, they point out a lot of things you're pointing out, but then all their policies are to make us more dependent.
[00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:34.991]  Well, I don't know.
[00:39:35.031 --> 00:39:36.111]  I don't know where I see that.
[00:39:36.331 --> 00:39:39.853]  I think most people probably would like to be dependent.
[00:39:39.893 --> 00:39:41.894]  Most people are followers, they're not leaders.
[00:39:42.586 --> 00:39:46.629]  Any way you shape it out, 80% of the people are going to do next to nothing.
[00:39:46.649 --> 00:39:50.971]  20% of the people are going to do most of the production in any economy.
[00:39:51.472 --> 00:39:56.675]  And most people don't think for themselves, and most people just generally are too lazy to think for themselves.
[00:39:57.355 --> 00:40:00.537]  Well, bottom line, where do you see the world in 10 years?
[00:40:00.597 --> 00:40:02.999]  I mean, it doesn't look good any way you slice it.
[00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:08.022]  Well, the debt issue is a real problem.
[00:40:08.082 --> 00:40:10.384]  The lack of productivity is a real problem.
[00:40:10.905 --> 00:40:12.786]  Our focus is a real problem.
[00:40:13.146 --> 00:40:14.448]  We need to put money in.
[00:40:14.788 --> 00:40:16.829]  We need to overhaul the educational system.
[00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:17.950]  I mean, radically.
[00:40:18.111 --> 00:40:18.891]  Like, right away.
[00:40:18.971 --> 00:40:21.273]  This is something Obama needs to be doing.
[00:40:21.293 --> 00:40:25.697]  We need to slow down, reverse the growth of government.
[00:40:25.817 --> 00:40:28.299]  Not only in the United States, but also in the Western nations.
[00:40:28.848 --> 00:40:29.829]  Well, that's not happening.
[00:40:30.169 --> 00:40:32.690]  Instead, they're going the opposite direction.
[00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:36.092]  So, where are we going, then, with these guys piloting things?
[00:40:38.293 --> 00:40:42.455]  Well, I mean, you're saying they're piloting things.
[00:40:42.535 --> 00:40:46.438]  I think it's also the general population, really.
[00:40:46.518 --> 00:40:51.340]  We're going to need probably some type of a collapse, I would say, to bring about global change.
[00:40:52.141 --> 00:40:56.203]  Because people don't really think we need any evolution of people's minds.
[00:40:56.963 --> 00:41:01.426]  We need people's minds to evolve and to change what their priorities are.
[00:41:01.766 --> 00:41:06.669]  And so the right crisis will bring in the new world order, Damon?
[00:41:10.031 --> 00:41:13.994]  Yes, I would say it all likelihood that a crisis probably would bring in a new world order.
[00:41:14.514 --> 00:41:21.378]  I would hope that that new world order is a change for the good, because clearly what we have in place right now is not working.
[00:41:22.339 --> 00:41:23.340]  None of it is working.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.301]  The systems are not working globally.
[00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:30.667]  So, you may need the disintegration of the present system before you build a new one.
[00:41:31.288 --> 00:41:32.929]  But this was a new world order.
[00:41:32.989 --> 00:41:35.652]  Globalization has accelerated all the problems.
[00:41:36.393 --> 00:41:38.034]  Well, you don't go, you don't go back.
[00:41:38.455 --> 00:41:43.159]  I mean, we're not, I mean, we're not, globalization is not going to go back.
[00:41:43.639 --> 00:41:47.523]  Maybe, inevitably, the place that we get to is that we really are one world.
[00:41:48.104 --> 00:41:50.546]  That we, that nations do become more like states.
[00:41:51.403 --> 00:41:56.567]  And we do have, and what we dissolve is the need to war with one another.
[00:41:56.747 --> 00:42:05.093]  Why are the globalists overrunning Europe and North America with the third world populations?
[00:42:05.193 --> 00:42:07.435]  I mean, they could clearly control that, but they're not.
[00:42:07.655 --> 00:42:15.701]  They want to overrun, because then those populations will vote to rob and fully enslave the final producers.
[00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:18.251]  Yeah, I don't know about that.
[00:42:18.411 --> 00:42:23.473]  I mean, why is the third world running towards the western world?
[00:42:23.513 --> 00:42:24.654]  They do it because of jobs.
[00:42:25.635 --> 00:42:33.659]  You know, Mexico comes to the United States so that they can export money back to Mexico and to Colombia and whatever else.
[00:42:33.679 --> 00:42:39.862]  The people migrate from the Chinese hinterland to Shanghai so that they can send money back to their agrarians.
[00:42:40.566 --> 00:42:48.553]  But of the third world so absolutely horrible... I don't believe that's orchestrated by any conspiring world power.
[00:42:48.673 --> 00:42:51.296]  Hell, the illegal aliens are above the law where I live.
[00:42:51.316 --> 00:42:53.337]  They don't even have to have a driver's license.
[00:42:53.397 --> 00:42:54.418]  They can drive.
[00:42:55.039 --> 00:42:56.901]  I mean, the system gives them a red carpet.
[00:42:57.662 --> 00:42:58.923]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:42:58.963 --> 00:43:04.325]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:43:04.565 --> 00:43:09.187]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:43:09.567 --> 00:43:14.649]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:43:15.149 --> 00:43:19.831]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:43:20.373 --> 00:43:27.298]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:43:27.478 --> 00:43:28.379]  And here's the best part.
[00:43:28.599 --> 00:43:34.984]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:43:35.304 --> 00:43:38.146]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:43:38.486 --> 00:43:40.368]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[00:43:48.236 --> 00:43:54.025]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:43:54.345 --> 00:43:56.729]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:43:58.055 --> 00:43:59.956]  Is your computer running slowly?

[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:19.423]  Damon Vickers, website, nancypaulmary.us.
[00:46:19.603 --> 00:46:22.905]  Our sites, infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:46:22.945 --> 00:46:24.125]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:46:24.145 --> 00:46:30.169]  Be sure and check out the online video bookstore at infowars.com if you want to get more informed on what's going on.
[00:46:31.857 --> 00:46:34.878]  Well, I mean, there's no doubt the currencies are going down worldwide.
[00:46:34.918 --> 00:46:39.680]  There's no doubt that we're going into a worldwide sustained depression.
[00:46:40.921 --> 00:46:46.723]  There is no doubt that government is just pressing the accelerator of growth.
[00:46:48.304 --> 00:46:51.285]  And so, again, I'll go back.
[00:46:52.947 --> 00:46:54.208]  Yeah, well, it's not happening right now.
[00:46:54.228 --> 00:46:57.529]  I mean, because what you're seeing is, you know, Portugal has had problems with Portugal.
[00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:58.609]  I think the last I heard was
[00:47:11.375 --> 00:47:16.199]  To insure $10 million of their debt, because they tried to sell some debt just last week.
[00:47:16.959 --> 00:47:20.102]  The price to insure that $10 million was $219,000.
[00:47:20.722 --> 00:47:23.264]  Just to insure the debt.
[00:47:23.664 --> 00:47:24.505]  That's pretty rich.
[00:47:25.466 --> 00:47:37.234]  So, what's happening is, because Western Europe, Portugal, Greece, Spain, UK, because these places are really coming in loose first, you're seeing a flight to quality.
[00:47:38.886 --> 00:47:39.687]  If the U.S.
[00:47:39.747 --> 00:47:40.827]  dollar is such a thing.
[00:47:41.387 --> 00:47:43.949]  But you've got to imagine a ship is sinking, right?
[00:47:44.269 --> 00:47:46.530]  And the rats will climb to higher decks on the ship.
[00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:48.431]  And so it is with markets.
[00:47:48.451 --> 00:47:52.073]  The currency thing is in fact unfolding on a global basis.
[00:47:52.474 --> 00:48:02.539]  But we're getting this temporary lift in dollars because global investors and global holders of currencies don't know where quite to put their money.
[00:48:02.579 --> 00:48:05.381]  So we've seen this lift in the U.S.
[00:48:05.461 --> 00:48:05.781]  dollar.
[00:48:05.801 --> 00:48:07.462]  So when does the ship go down?
[00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:11.532]  When does the ship go down?
[00:48:12.633 --> 00:48:14.354]  I'm not sure when it happens.
[00:48:14.954 --> 00:48:18.256]  I can tell you that when it does happen, though, it'll happen pretty quick.
[00:48:18.316 --> 00:48:19.457]  It'll happen like an overnight.
[00:48:19.497 --> 00:48:24.901]  What is the crow's nest that will have hundreds of rats piled on it as it goes down into the North Atlantic?
[00:48:26.241 --> 00:48:28.023]  What a great imagery, Alex.
[00:48:28.163 --> 00:48:28.943]  The crow's nest.
[00:48:29.043 --> 00:48:30.064]  What are you talking about?
[00:48:30.184 --> 00:48:32.085]  What do you mean, crow's nest?
[00:48:32.565 --> 00:48:37.369]  That's the area up on the main mast where the lookout, and it's the last part of the ship to go under.
[00:48:38.263 --> 00:48:39.084]  So you've got rats.
[00:48:40.845 --> 00:48:47.930]  Famous historians wrote about ships going under and rats going up and perching on the top of the mast as it goes under.
[00:48:49.351 --> 00:48:50.772]  It's probably hard asset.
[00:48:52.682 --> 00:48:53.142]  Inevitably.
[00:48:53.843 --> 00:48:57.444]  So gold, real estate, things like that?
[00:48:57.524 --> 00:48:58.645]  Real estate is inflated.
[00:48:58.665 --> 00:49:02.547]  It wouldn't be real estate because real estate is inflated by all the excess dollars.
[00:49:02.587 --> 00:49:05.128]  But at least it's something that's got something real is what I meant.
[00:49:05.448 --> 00:49:12.472]  No, no, but unless it's farmland or something like that and really there won't be much demand for that.
[00:49:12.972 --> 00:49:15.053]  No, real estate is going to be going down for years.
[00:49:15.433 --> 00:49:15.934]  So what is it?
[00:49:16.014 --> 00:49:16.394]  Gold?
[00:49:16.454 --> 00:49:17.334]  I mean gold period?
[00:49:17.374 --> 00:49:17.755]  What else?
[00:49:17.775 --> 00:49:18.395]  What else is hard?
[00:49:19.633 --> 00:49:33.924]  You know, I guess just commodities, but even if it really, really got bad, you'd have to temper the rise in gold with the fact that some people, some holders would be selling gold because they would have nothing else to sell.
[00:49:35.005 --> 00:49:35.246]  Right?
[00:49:35.306 --> 00:49:36.707]  If your currency's worth nothing.
[00:49:37.067 --> 00:49:44.333]  So you have a depression in the real economy, so it doesn't matter if you're the crows nest because you're still going under?
[00:49:44.353 --> 00:49:49.257]  Yeah, in an all-out total global collapse, the deflationary
[00:49:49.997 --> 00:49:50.898]  We're good to go.
[00:50:12.114 --> 00:50:14.996]  Look, whatever the trends are, we're going to follow them.
[00:50:15.056 --> 00:50:20.160]  Whether the trend for the market is up or the trend for the markets are down, we're going to seek to capitalize on them.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:26.585]  If the markets continue to roll over, we will increasingly get short, like we did in 2008.
[00:50:26.625 --> 00:50:30.127]  But for the general public, you see even more storms ahead.
[00:50:31.268 --> 00:50:33.950]  I think the underlying trends are pretty strong.
[00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:36.972]  You've got to really be alert and keep looking at your... Hold on.
[00:50:38.934 --> 00:50:40.655]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:50:42.469 --> 00:50:44.830]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:51.272]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:50:51.592 --> 00:50:55.653]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:50:55.933 --> 00:51:01.334]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:01.674 --> 00:51:02.135]  It's true.
[00:51:02.415 --> 00:51:06.976]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:07.276 --> 00:51:07.837]  Number 3.
[00:51:08.097 --> 00:51:11.399]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:15.442]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:15.623 --> 00:51:16.163]  Number 4.
[00:51:16.403 --> 00:51:18.785]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:19.165 --> 00:51:22.548]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:51:22.848 --> 00:51:23.389]  Number 5.
[00:51:23.649 --> 00:51:27.552]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:51:27.792 --> 00:51:32.556]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:51:32.836 --> 00:51:36.857]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:51:38.777 --> 00:51:40.878]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:51:41.038 --> 00:51:43.318]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:51:43.378 --> 00:51:44.218]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:44.238 --> 00:51:45.459]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:51:45.499 --> 00:51:45.839]  Big Brother.
[00:52:03.161 --> 00:52:04.182]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:04.923 --> 00:52:06.023]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:06.684 --> 00:52:07.505]  You want answers?
[00:52:08.265 --> 00:52:09.186]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:09.206 --> 00:52:13.469]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:18.093]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:18.934 --> 00:52:26.420]  We've been getting a very interesting perspective in the last 45 minutes from Damon Vickers, Nine Points Capital Partners Director.
[00:52:27.571 --> 00:52:34.255]  The website is www.npm.us, our site is infowars.com.
[00:52:34.695 --> 00:52:41.179]  Bob Chapman on a host of issues of theinternationalforecaster.com coming up in the next segment.
[00:52:41.199 --> 00:52:42.059]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:52:42.399 --> 00:52:47.002]  Damon, your grace is up to stay with us a few more minutes so you can finish your thought there.
[00:52:47.542 --> 00:52:48.263]  You were talking about
[00:52:48.923 --> 00:53:11.052]  Other currencies going down, and that's what Dr. Paul Greg Roberts three months ago predicted, Bob Chapman, many others we've had on are saying the same thing that you've been talking about, that as other currencies go down, because they're even in more debt with big government than we are, that rats are going up to higher levels of the ship, and they're now on the deck, which is the United States, and so that's buoying the dollar for a time, but
[00:53:12.873 --> 00:53:17.437]  The government's only pressing the accelerator for more government, more spending, more bailouts.
[00:53:17.938 --> 00:53:20.220]  So again, how do you see the ship going under?
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:22.282]  Because they're clearly not going to right the ship.
[00:53:24.118 --> 00:53:24.718]  I don't think so.
[00:53:24.759 --> 00:53:36.764]  I mean, if we're assuming that government is going to have this, like, epiphany of understanding what it is that actually creates jobs and innovation and all that, that's not going to come from government.
[00:53:36.784 --> 00:53:39.305]  You know, I'd like to see better tax policies in place.
[00:53:39.625 --> 00:53:40.685]  That might really help us.
[00:53:41.186 --> 00:53:47.428]  But really, we need to encourage innovation and technological leadership.
[00:53:47.608 --> 00:53:51.410]  And I mean really push, really, really, really push for it.
[00:53:52.094 --> 00:53:52.554]  I don't
[00:54:10.421 --> 00:54:11.582]  And then that makes more bubbles!
[00:54:28.522 --> 00:54:28.762]  No, no, no.
[00:54:28.782 --> 00:54:29.763]  It has nothing to do with bubbles.
[00:54:29.883 --> 00:54:34.086]  Inevitably, in an all-out decline, inevitably in an all-out decline, everything goes down.
[00:54:34.426 --> 00:54:35.567]  Got it.
[00:54:35.587 --> 00:54:48.177]  So, the delusion that investors have right now of selling their Greek currency and the pounds and the euros and going into dollars is really short-sighted.
[00:54:48.357 --> 00:54:52.280]  Inevitably, they'll be selling dollars, too, and the dollar will go down as well.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:54.361]  Well, I was thinking mainly of
[00:54:56.178 --> 00:55:07.021]  Commodities being bubbles because if they're the best thing out there, then finally when people have to dump them because that's the only value there is to pay for things, I mean that does pop a bubble.
[00:55:09.073 --> 00:55:21.422]  Well, the commodities is an interesting one, because the global commodities, like all asset prices, have been driven up because of the excess supply of currency that's in the planet.
[00:55:21.822 --> 00:55:23.183]  The printing of currency.
[00:55:23.524 --> 00:55:27.507]  It's not just us that's had this all out of hand and in love with the printing press.
[00:55:27.967 --> 00:55:30.068]  It's all of these countries that we're talking about.
[00:55:30.108 --> 00:55:31.630]  It's the Greeks, it's Portugal.
[00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:34.131]  What do you think the export is of Greeks?
[00:55:34.412 --> 00:55:34.752]  What is it?
[00:55:35.683 --> 00:55:36.904]  Was it olive oil?
[00:55:36.964 --> 00:55:37.544]  What are they?
[00:55:37.624 --> 00:55:38.965]  I was about to say olives.
[00:55:39.065 --> 00:55:40.546]  You're right, olives.
[00:55:40.566 --> 00:55:43.828]  You know, it's... You know, what are they?
[00:55:43.848 --> 00:55:44.649]  Spain.
[00:55:44.829 --> 00:55:53.494]  So we have this G20 coordinated printing press, like an arms race, but of money, and so we got one minute left.
[00:55:53.574 --> 00:55:54.335]  What does it lead to?
[00:55:55.755 --> 00:56:03.000]  Inevitably, I think, when it all... inevitably, people lose faith in currencies in their entirety.
[00:56:03.604 --> 00:56:08.048]  And you get some type of probably new monetary form of exchange.
[00:56:08.568 --> 00:56:10.009]  Yes, because it's electronic.
[00:56:10.049 --> 00:56:12.311]  Because we're in the digital age, it's electronic.
[00:56:13.051 --> 00:56:16.334]  And it's more something like that.
[00:56:17.735 --> 00:56:18.716]  A global government?
[00:56:19.276 --> 00:56:20.177]  A global government.
[00:56:20.277 --> 00:56:25.781]  A new global system of debit and credit that are all managed electronically on a global basis.
[00:56:26.222 --> 00:56:28.864]  But they plan that to be carbon-based, but that's failing.
[00:56:30.103 --> 00:56:32.545]  Well, we'll see if they're able to bring that back to life.
[00:56:33.085 --> 00:56:33.786]  All the best, Alex.
[00:56:33.866 --> 00:56:34.947]  Great being with you.
[00:56:34.967 --> 00:56:35.968]  Damon, thank you for being with us.
[00:56:36.008 --> 00:56:36.408]  Take care.
[00:56:37.529 --> 00:56:41.612]  All right, Bob Chapman straight ahead, ladies and gentlemen, giving you Damon Vickers' perspective.
[00:56:42.713 --> 00:56:46.756]  Kind of a globalist perspective, but we need to hear from all the different views out there.
[00:56:47.277 --> 00:56:48.838]  Bob Chapman straight ahead.
[00:56:49.198 --> 00:56:56.064]  We'll see what he has to say about what's going on with the plunging stock market, dollar rising, gold going down some, massive debt increases.
[00:56:59.178 --> 00:57:02.799]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:57:03.139 --> 00:57:11.261]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:57:12.001 --> 00:57:16.022]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:57:16.622 --> 00:57:27.444]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:57:28.064 --> 00:57:37.088]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:42.611]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:57:43.011 --> 00:57:50.214]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:57:50.495 --> 00:57:53.256]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:57:58.385 --> 00:58:02.028]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:02.408 --> 00:58:05.410]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:10.434]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:58:10.454 --> 00:58:16.678]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:58:16.838 --> 00:58:19.080]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:19.900]  Tim Geithner?
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:20.341]  Bernanke?
[00:58:20.421 --> 00:58:21.201]  They're arsonists!
[00:58:21.221 --> 00:58:22.362]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:58:22.382 --> 00:58:24.624]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:58:38.516 --> 00:58:40.357]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:58:40.637 --> 00:58:45.459]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:58:45.779 --> 00:58:54.902]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:57.009 --> 00:59:02.250]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:05.111]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:59:05.131 --> 00:59:09.592]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:59:10.452 --> 00:59:14.913]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfallWars.com.
[00:59:14.933 --> 00:59:19.434]  We also have some specials when you get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.
[00:59:19.934 --> 00:59:30.947]  A new level in production quality and in information exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[00:59:31.107 --> 00:59:32.688]  This film needs to be seen.
[00:59:32.949 --> 00:59:33.870]  Everybody needs to get it.

[00:59:44.893 --> 00:59:45.633]  Shadow Government.

[00:59:55.195 --> 01:00:02.716]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:05.317]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:12.654]  Well, we're already halfway into this radio broadcast.
[01:00:12.674 --> 01:00:15.657]  We've got an hour and 52 minutes left in transmission.
[01:00:16.158 --> 01:00:26.631]  For the next hour, we're going to have Bob Chapman on with us in all news blitz and have open phones in the last hour of this live Friday, the 5th day of February 2010 edition.
[01:00:29.755 --> 01:00:35.176]  You know, we have an online video bookstore where my 24 award-winning films are on DVD.
[01:00:36.016 --> 01:00:41.878]  We have all the Patriot t-shirts so that you can spread the word when you're out on the streets and meet like-minded people.
[01:00:41.918 --> 01:00:46.279]  And your purchase of the books, videos, and t-shirts and ball caps also funds this operation.
[01:00:46.799 --> 01:00:49.259]  This is free market resistance to the New World Order.
[01:00:49.959 --> 01:00:52.580]  Our sponsors also make it possible, so thank you for supporting them.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:59.022]  But, you know, I was involved as a consultant and also appeared in Jesse Ventura's hit TV show.
[01:00:59.042 --> 01:01:00.703]  They're looking at a second season right now.
[01:01:00.723 --> 01:01:03.984]  We should have news very soon for you on that on TruTV.
[01:01:05.104 --> 01:01:08.806]  And the media is saying, wow, record ratings on TruTV for this.
[01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:10.406]  People really want to know about conspiracies.
[01:01:10.486 --> 01:01:15.248]  No, they don't trust the media anymore and they want government crimes investigated.
[01:01:16.192 --> 01:01:19.595]  Well, Jesse Ventura has written a new book.
[01:01:19.675 --> 01:01:20.615]  I think it's his best book.
[01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:25.639]  I've read Don't Start a Revolution Without Me, Ain't Got Time to Bleed, and others.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.221]  And, you know, I helped wake up Ventura.
[01:01:28.241 --> 01:01:29.422]  So did his son Tyrell.
[01:01:29.943 --> 01:01:31.244]  And there's a lot of me in this book.
[01:01:31.264 --> 01:01:34.546]  I mean, a lot of information that we've helped Ventura look into.
[01:01:35.047 --> 01:01:37.449]  You notice the name is American Conspiracies.
[01:01:38.109 --> 01:01:45.312]  And the original pilot TV show for Court TV, now True TV, was with myself, of course, was called American Conspiracy.
[01:01:45.873 --> 01:01:47.033]  And it covers it all.
[01:01:47.213 --> 01:01:52.296]  Read more about what the book covers at Infowars.com on the shopping cart page.
[01:01:52.696 --> 01:01:56.838]  Now, it doesn't ship out until early March.
[01:01:57.038 --> 01:01:58.338]  We're talking a month away.
[01:01:59.779 --> 01:02:02.060]  But the books are actually being shipped to me next week.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.821]  We're going to have them pretty much for anybody else.
[01:02:05.182 --> 01:02:08.783]  The book is $24.95 in bookstores when it hits store shelves.
[01:02:08.823 --> 01:02:09.804]  That's the retail price.
[01:02:09.824 --> 01:02:11.044]  We're selling it for $19.95.
[01:02:12.345 --> 01:02:21.188]  Jesse Ventura's new book, American Conspiracies, Lies, Lies, and More Lies Your Government Told You.
[01:02:22.088 --> 01:02:30.591]  And this is certainly a book that everybody needs to get and you can get free when you order it.
[01:02:32.045 --> 01:02:32.405]  I don't think so.
[01:02:50.859 --> 01:02:51.739]  Get half price.
[01:02:52.179 --> 01:02:53.520]  Fall of the Republic.
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:03:03.022]  And we have a deal up there on the site where you can get a t-shirt for $5.95 when you get it with American Conspiracy.

[01:03:15.004 --> 01:03:17.926]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, get the book today.
[01:03:17.946 --> 01:03:23.650]  Infowars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:03:24.311 --> 01:03:28.434]  American Conspiracies with former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:03:28.474 --> 01:03:30.015]  It is a powerful book.
[01:03:30.295 --> 01:03:31.896]  You might have them add on the shopping cart.
[01:03:31.936 --> 01:03:33.638]  Tell Tim the full title.
[01:03:34.605 --> 01:03:37.926]  American conspiracies, lies, lies, and more lies from your government.
[01:03:38.866 --> 01:03:44.428]  Get him to add that because it just went up today for folks that are interested.
[01:03:44.468 --> 01:03:45.208]  Thank you so much.
[01:03:45.268 --> 01:03:52.010]  Okay, I want to get into the economy first because for two years they've been telling us that the economy is getting better.
[01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:53.771]  They were telling us that really four years ago.
[01:03:54.411 --> 01:04:01.093]  And so I want Bob Chapman, who's really the leading expert we have on of so many economists, brokers, researchers, trends forecasters,
[01:04:03.496 --> 01:04:16.967]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts three months ago, two and a half months ago, said that when the carry trade reversed to the U.S., that other currencies were imploding so bad that for a while the dollar would go back up and gold would probably go down, but then race up later.
[01:04:16.987 --> 01:04:30.218]  And we saw it go down, race back up, now go down somewhat, but as Damon Vickers said earlier, all that's left at the end of the day is gold and silver, and he doesn't sell gold and silver, he's telling you that though.
[01:04:31.359 --> 01:04:33.682]  Because that's all that has any real value.
[01:04:34.663 --> 01:04:40.868]  And so you have a depression in the real economy, while the banks fill themselves and their fat bellies full of trillions of dollars.
[01:04:41.749 --> 01:04:51.398]  You have government worldwide ballooning in size, because it's the mechanism for taking the public's wealth and giving it to the elite, and giving some chicken feed to the unwashed masses to control them.
[01:04:52.499 --> 01:04:53.619]  And so much is going on.
[01:04:53.679 --> 01:04:56.220]  Stock market plunging while the dollar goes up.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:02.721]  You've got Pennsylvania and other states, California saying they're going into bankruptcy.
[01:05:03.401 --> 01:05:08.502]  You've got states and cities passing taxes on food, baby food, milk.
[01:05:08.522 --> 01:05:10.242]  I mean, talk about draconian.
[01:05:10.583 --> 01:05:11.743]  They're going to squeeze and squeeze.
[01:05:11.843 --> 01:05:14.963]  Is there a method to this madness and where is it all going?
[01:05:15.303 --> 01:05:17.544]  Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:05:17.564 --> 01:05:18.224]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:05:19.713 --> 01:05:31.615]  Well, thank you and it's very nice to be back and I only wish that we had yourself and Jesse and others like you in the early 1960s.
[01:05:31.715 --> 01:05:35.056]  It wouldn't have been such a hard 50 years.
[01:05:36.396 --> 01:05:47.798]  But with that said, we've crossed a great river here and that is we're really delivering the message and we're really getting out there and we're really driving the
[01:05:48.702 --> 01:05:49.742]  Illumina's crazy.
[01:05:50.423 --> 01:05:53.423]  And they're on the run as we've discussed before.
[01:05:54.104 --> 01:06:06.927]  As far as the economy's concerned, sources told me this morning that they expect that the administration's going to look for $150 billion as another stimulus program.
[01:06:07.267 --> 01:06:09.928]  Nothing like the almost $800 billion that they had before.
[01:06:10.388 --> 01:06:12.869]  But you've got to remember they're going to, out of the budget,
[01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:16.952]  Double the amount of money that is spent on education.
[01:06:16.972 --> 01:06:24.717]  They're going to, in some way, create jobs by using credits and tax things.
[01:06:24.937 --> 01:06:32.682]  And just to interrupt, Bob, you said in October of 2008 there would be a second stimulus in 2010 when they were swearing there wouldn't be.
[01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:33.662]  How did you know that?
[01:06:35.864 --> 01:06:40.626]  I knew that because they really should have not done $800 billion
[01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:59.639]  They really needed about $1.5 trillion, and as it's happened, they didn't have enough and they need more, and what they did get, obliquely, was a hand through the quantitative easing program, the $23.7 trillion.
[01:06:59.659 --> 01:07:00.600]  But even that hasn't been enough.
[01:07:05.982 --> 01:07:12.607]  And so they're going to spend $100 billion, quote, creating jobs.
[01:07:12.667 --> 01:07:14.489]  Of course, it'll be short term and won't work.
[01:07:15.469 --> 01:07:21.514]  And they're going to give states loans of $25 billion to keep them from going bankrupt.
[01:07:22.475 --> 01:07:25.937]  And so if you add it all up, it comes close to $500 billion.
[01:07:25.957 --> 01:07:28.700]  And that's what I figured they might be able to get away with.
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:29.580]  And that's what they've got.
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:32.502]  And that will carry them probably into the election.
[01:07:32.543 --> 01:07:33.043]  And that's it.
[01:07:34.011 --> 01:07:35.951]  And then everything will sputter and go down again.
[01:07:35.991 --> 01:07:43.413]  You saw the GDP figures, and it was 5.7% growth in the final quarter of last year.
[01:07:44.273 --> 01:07:49.614]  And of that, 60% or more was replacing inventory.
[01:07:49.654 --> 01:07:52.495]  So the real growth was 2.4% officially.
[01:07:53.615 --> 01:07:55.276]  It was probably a little bit less than that.
[01:07:55.376 --> 01:07:56.336]  My guess was 1.5% to 2.5%.
[01:07:56.376 --> 01:07:57.436]  But I'm not going to argue.
[01:07:57.536 --> 01:07:58.516]  It was all created.
[01:08:02.435 --> 01:08:06.097]  By infusion of capital of one kind of another.
[01:08:06.517 --> 01:08:11.379]  And by the election you mean the 2010 Congressional election coming up?
[01:08:11.739 --> 01:08:15.241]  You see them trying to stall the collapse until then?
[01:08:15.281 --> 01:08:16.921]  You see things getting a lot worse next year?
[01:08:18.262 --> 01:08:18.482]  Yes.
[01:08:19.362 --> 01:08:27.326]  And unless they come along with another... Oh, I think the next time they'll need a trillion to a trillion and a half if they're going to do that.
[01:08:27.626 --> 01:08:30.307]  You know, the Fed talks about withdrawing money from the system.
[01:08:30.327 --> 01:08:31.108]  They can't do that.
[01:08:31.168 --> 01:08:31.788]  It'll collapse.
[01:08:32.429 --> 01:08:39.352]  They've taken money and credit, the old M3, down from 17.4% to approximately 3%.
[01:08:40.592 --> 01:08:47.095]  And, you know, the European Central Bank has brought theirs down from 12.8% to minus 0.08%.
[01:08:47.135 --> 01:08:51.036]  Why is the Bank of England slowing printing?
[01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:54.377]  For the same reason the others are.
[01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:55.538]  It's all coordinated.
[01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:56.918]  They're down to 3%.
[01:08:56.958 --> 01:08:59.259]  And they had a high of 14.5%.
[01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:14.616]  And what they're up to exactly, I can't figure out, because they're skating along the edge of deflationary depression by taking down M3 and M4.
[01:09:15.476 --> 01:09:17.297]  The Europeans call it M4.
[01:09:18.518 --> 01:09:23.400]  And so they cannot take any money out of the system unless they want it to collapse.
[01:09:24.689 --> 01:09:32.716]  Put this in layman terms, because I study this constantly and I'm with you, but barely, so a lot of the audience may not.
[01:09:33.136 --> 01:09:38.421]  In layman's terms, they give themselves $28 trillion conservatively in the U.S.
[01:09:38.481 --> 01:09:39.982]  alone, another $20 trillion globally.
[01:09:40.322 --> 01:09:42.044]  They're buying up all the real assets.
[01:09:42.324 --> 01:09:44.065]  They're not letting local banks loan.
[01:09:44.546 --> 01:09:45.587]  They clearly want
[01:09:46.007 --> 01:10:14.225]  to implode the economy so they can consolidate, while they're claiming they're trying to hire jobs, they're just massing the government against us, growing their muscle against their slaves, and if they... and then now central banks are starting to cut money supply, and are starting to cut the issuance of currency, which does forestall things, so it looks like they want things to implode, or just stall it just long enough, or what?
[01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:19.253]  It's hard to tell, because we won't know until we get out further.
[01:10:20.273 --> 01:10:22.315]  And that won't happen until later in the year.
[01:10:22.735 --> 01:10:38.385]  And you see the fiasco that's going on in the European countries, both in Eastern Europe, as well as Greece, and now they're talking about Portugal and Spain and Ireland, which I talked about for some time, being problematic, and now they are.
[01:10:38.705 --> 01:10:42.368]  But, you know, people have to consider, the dollar's no panacea, because
[01:10:43.095 --> 01:10:48.578]  Their debt, public debt to GDP, will be about 95% this year.
[01:10:49.498 --> 01:10:51.699]  Well, that's as bad as any country in the world.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.961]  I mean, there's only a couple of countries that are higher.
[01:10:55.701 --> 01:11:00.924]  And so, the United States has got the same problems that everybody else has, or vice versa.
[01:11:01.524 --> 01:11:05.046]  So you see this debt implosion problem that's going on in Europe.
[01:11:05.446 --> 01:11:06.067]  Nothing new.
[01:11:06.727 --> 01:11:08.468]  They just discovered it.
[01:11:08.528 --> 01:11:09.088]  It happened.
[01:11:09.288 --> 01:11:11.689]  And we know the G20 is coordinating this.
[01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:12.210]  Why?
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:24.224]  The reason why they want to do that is that they want to act in unison so they can help one another when they need to do what they are going to do.
[01:11:24.764 --> 01:11:34.228]  See, I don't know, and I don't know anybody who does know outside the inner circle, when they're going to pull the plug and go to a deflationary depression.
[01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:40.431]  And they're eventually going to do that, but they want to do it in their own way at their own time.
[01:11:42.008 --> 01:11:46.656]  And they probably want to coordinate a war as a political smokescreen when they pull the trigger.
[01:11:47.457 --> 01:11:50.642]  Absolutely, and there's a good chance of that in the Middle East this year.
[01:11:50.662 --> 01:11:51.884]  Alright, stay there.
[01:11:52.004 --> 01:11:52.986]  It's all coming together.
[01:11:53.387 --> 01:11:56.432]  Let's break down the geopolitical landscape with Bob Chapman straight ahead.
[01:11:58.777 --> 01:12:01.942]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[01:12:02.162 --> 01:12:10.195]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[01:12:10.355 --> 01:12:14.121]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster
[01:12:14.641 --> 01:12:28.226]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:12:28.366 --> 01:12:32.787]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:12:32.947 --> 01:12:38.669]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before retirement.
[01:12:38.769 --> 01:12:42.150]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:44.993]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:12:45.113 --> 01:12:50.019]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:12:50.179 --> 01:12:50.459]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:12:50.479 --> 01:12:51.821]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:12:57.467 --> 01:13:07.212]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:13:07.493 --> 01:13:13.536]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:13:13.936 --> 01:13:22.781]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:13:23.161 --> 01:13:32.068]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:13:32.349 --> 01:13:36.932]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:13:37.213 --> 01:13:38.494]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:13:38.754 --> 01:13:41.256]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[01:13:41.536 --> 01:13:42.417]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[01:13:42.557 --> 01:13:48.682]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[01:13:49.022 --> 01:13:52.385]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[01:13:52.605 --> 01:13:56.608]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:13:58.610 --> 01:14:02.253]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:14:02.613 --> 01:14:05.635]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:14:05.876 --> 01:14:07.277]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:14:07.975 --> 01:14:10.636]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:14:10.656 --> 01:14:16.857]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:14:17.037 --> 01:14:22.058]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:14:22.579 --> 01:14:32.221]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:14:32.341 --> 01:14:34.442]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:14:34.683 --> 01:14:36.003]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:14:36.264 --> 01:14:38.545]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:14:38.725 --> 01:14:40.567]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:14:40.847 --> 01:14:45.670]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:55.116]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:14:57.245 --> 01:15:01.412]  Americans have heard much about change in recent times and are now waking up to the truth.
[01:15:01.652 --> 01:15:04.637]  Well, here's a few facts about your food you may want to change.
[01:15:04.817 --> 01:15:12.289]  Did you know that nearly 100% of the food on store shelves comes from a few corporations and that most is genetically engineered, chemically sprayed,
[01:15:15.282 --> 01:15:15.842]  We're good to go!

[01:16:20.464 --> 01:16:22.766]  Monday through Friday, we're here live, 11 a.m.
[01:16:22.806 --> 01:16:25.408]  Central, 12 noon Eastern.
[01:16:25.429 --> 01:16:28.411]  12 noon Eastern to 4 p.m.
[01:16:28.471 --> 01:16:28.832]  Eastern.
[01:16:28.852 --> 01:16:33.015]  We'll be back this Sunday with a surprise guest in the last hour, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:16:33.035 --> 01:16:35.177]  with the abbreviated Sunday transmission.
[01:16:35.237 --> 01:16:37.780]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:43.565]  You know, Bob, we can sit here and talk about it and talk about it and talk about it and talk about it.
[01:16:45.322 --> 01:16:49.103]  They're moving more ships, more weapons in, new sanctions on Iran.
[01:16:49.963 --> 01:16:55.725]  It's a total replay of 1991, 2003 with Iraq.
[01:16:56.025 --> 01:16:59.526]  They're openly saying they're getting ready for the bombardment the next year.
[01:17:00.066 --> 01:17:01.546]  They're moving more forces in.
[01:17:01.967 --> 01:17:06.308]  They've set up their Council of Governors so Obama can say, oh, I took over the states.
[01:17:07.168 --> 01:17:23.159]  But, you know, don't worry, I have these puppet governors, and the head of the Homeland Security Board, sub-board of this, is the Governor Nixon, who put out the MIAC report for the feds, demonizing conservatives, gun owners, patriots, libertarians, returning veterans.
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.962]  And they're now openly talking about shutting down freedom on the web.
[01:17:28.663 --> 01:17:31.585]  It's happening in Europe, happening in Italy, happening in Australia.
[01:17:34.289 --> 01:17:36.131]  Clearly staged the underwear bombing.
[01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:42.137]  It's now come out the FBI basically orchestrated all of that and protected the guy and let him get on the plane, the State Department.
[01:17:43.418 --> 01:17:53.208]  I mean, we know what they're doing and we're in a race to get the public to not just care about the Super Bowl, but actually care about what the globalists are doing.
[01:17:53.248 --> 01:17:55.010]  I mean, looking at the method of their madness,
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:07.247]  They've orchestrated this whole plan, but now their plan, their cornerstone of the new carbon tax bubble, is in deep trouble.
[01:18:07.527 --> 01:18:08.968]  So what does that do to them?
[01:18:09.008 --> 01:18:13.872]  Because they're still going ahead with the plan, though on every front, they're on fire.
[01:18:13.892 --> 01:18:15.513]  I mean, they're falling apart.
[01:18:17.875 --> 01:18:18.335]  You're right.
[01:18:18.375 --> 01:18:26.421]  They are running into problems that they didn't expect, and I think that
[01:18:29.016 --> 01:18:42.102]  You talk about taxation, the carbon tax, that isn't going to happen anytime soon, although our president said he's going to end-run the situation, run through the EPA, as you pointed out before.
[01:18:43.082 --> 01:18:56.028]  But I think the trial balloon for the comments, which are open next week, and the new, which the public hasn't even heard about yet, the new guaranteed annuity that
[01:18:56.710 --> 01:19:00.171]  The administration and the people who control it have planned.
[01:19:01.371 --> 01:19:17.614]  We don't know what form it's going to come in, but it's going to be a tax raiser, and it's going to be, in some way, something that the government can either use as collateral or get fresh funds in to fund their debt.
[01:19:17.954 --> 01:19:19.495]  They have a heck of a time funding it.
[01:19:20.275 --> 01:19:24.836]  Last year, the Fed, just in the Treasuries alone, purchased 80% of them.
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.441]  And they're not going to tell you that, but if you back into it, you can see that.
[01:19:29.481 --> 01:19:34.503]  A few writers have come out with it, but most of them, they don't know, they don't understand.
[01:19:35.144 --> 01:19:40.486]  So what this is, this plan for this annuity, it may come in any form.
[01:19:40.626 --> 01:19:52.010]  We don't know yet what it is, but they're talking about a 5% tax, like the Social Security tax, and that money would be earmarked for an account for you as an annuity for the future.
[01:19:52.591 --> 01:19:52.911]  And then,
[01:19:53.869 --> 01:20:02.898]  They also talked about a voluntary plan whereby somebody could pledge a certain percentage of their retirement, whether it's pension, a 401k or IRA, etc.
[01:20:05.265 --> 01:20:05.785]  I don't know.
[01:20:26.431 --> 01:20:27.392]  Bob, incredible.
[01:20:28.072 --> 01:20:33.295]  I mean, that's why we have you on so often, because sometimes I can't see the forest for the trees.
[01:20:33.836 --> 01:20:40.440]  I'm sitting here saying if their environmental takeover is in trouble, what are they going to do to fund their operation?
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:53.528]  And in plain view, you've been saying for five years, and I have as well, when Bush changed the rules to take pensions, and now they've changed the rules to take money markets, and now they're saying they're going to take your pension and put it in a government fund and tax it.
[01:20:54.794 --> 01:21:04.503]  That clearly they're now moving to do that, and it's just so outrageous that even though I know they're already starting to do it, I can't believe they're that bold.
[01:21:04.563 --> 01:21:09.908]  I mean, if they're asking for a revolution, isn't that the quickest way to get it is to steal people's retirement?
[01:21:10.829 --> 01:21:11.370]  You got it.
[01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:13.532]  You're absolutely correct.
[01:21:13.812 --> 01:21:15.974]  And desperate people do desperate things.
[01:21:16.654 --> 01:21:19.217]  And again, we have forced them into this position.
[01:21:19.944 --> 01:21:31.628]  And that's why they're pushing ahead on all fronts, such as the things with Homeland Security, the federalization of law enforcement, and all the other things that you talk about on the program.
[01:21:32.048 --> 01:21:32.648]  Stay there, Bob.
[01:21:32.688 --> 01:21:34.309]  Yeah, they're running scared.
[01:21:34.329 --> 01:21:39.330]  I want you to come back and flesh out, because, I mean, this is mainstream now that they're taking the pension funds.
[01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:40.571]  Private companies are.
[01:21:40.631 --> 01:21:42.091]  The government's getting ready to snatch it.
[01:21:42.812 --> 01:21:44.552]  The health care plan's in trouble.
[01:21:44.592 --> 01:21:45.813]  That was a new big tax.
[01:21:46.453 --> 01:21:46.833]  Stay there.
[01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:50.822]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:51.764 --> 01:21:54.449]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:57.608 --> 01:22:00.209]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:22:00.609 --> 01:22:05.570]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:07.690]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:12.811]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:22:12.991 --> 01:22:13.951]  How much do you want?
[01:22:14.171 --> 01:22:14.911]  When do you want it?
[01:22:15.291 --> 01:22:16.892]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:22:17.172 --> 01:22:18.012]  When will you need it?
[01:22:18.252 --> 01:22:20.312]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:22:20.452 --> 01:22:21.573]  Will there be any food?
[01:22:21.793 --> 01:22:23.093]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:22:23.353 --> 01:22:28.398]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:22:28.578 --> 01:22:31.781]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:22:32.182 --> 01:22:35.685]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:22:35.985 --> 01:22:36.986]  How much will you need?
[01:22:37.226 --> 01:22:37.827]  We don't know.
[01:22:38.127 --> 01:22:39.048]  How much do you want?
[01:22:39.228 --> 01:22:39.949]  All you can get.
[01:22:39.969 --> 01:22:40.850]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:22:41.230 --> 01:22:41.450]  I think.
[01:22:56.894 --> 01:22:57.874]  What's your home worth?
[01:22:58.054 --> 01:22:59.975]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:23:00.155 --> 01:23:02.896]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:23:03.196 --> 01:23:10.719]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[01:23:56.311 --> 01:24:03.156]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:24:03.276 --> 01:24:05.217]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[01:25:08.015 --> 01:25:09.076]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[01:25:09.096 --> 01:25:12.279]  I'm going to open the phones up specifically for questions for Bob Chapman.
[01:25:12.299 --> 01:25:13.199]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:14.160]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:20.486]  Bob, you got cut off by that break.
[01:25:21.387 --> 01:25:35.098]  I mean, when we got up here five years ago, four years ago, two years ago, last month, and read the mainstream articles where the government comes out and says, oh, we'll take your private pension plans and the government
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:40.428]  We'll keep them and tax them but pay them out to you and owe your...
[01:25:41.684 --> 01:25:44.166]  Money markets aren't protected.
[01:25:44.186 --> 01:25:45.567]  You know, 3% or something.
[01:25:46.447 --> 01:25:47.368]  Returns people get.
[01:25:47.388 --> 01:25:49.630]  I mean, I've got a bank account that's a money market.
[01:25:50.811 --> 01:25:51.811]  That's not protected.
[01:25:51.831 --> 01:25:54.093]  I mean, that's destroying confidence.
[01:25:54.693 --> 01:26:00.537]  And then their health care plan is a massive tax increase on basically everybody except some of the poorest Americans.
[01:26:01.638 --> 01:26:06.662]  And then it's a tax on them because more companies will just lay people off to be able to pay for the health care.
[01:26:08.228 --> 01:26:13.073]  And so they're failing on that plan because it's so unconstitutional and transparently corrupt.
[01:26:13.093 --> 01:26:13.753]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:26:14.054 --> 01:26:15.415]  The carbon taxes, they're in trouble.
[01:26:15.915 --> 01:26:18.898]  The healthcare money grab, they're in trouble.
[01:26:19.298 --> 01:26:21.180]  So what are they going to do, Bob?
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.703]  That's hard to say.
[01:26:25.925 --> 01:26:26.345]  I don't know.
[01:26:26.605 --> 01:26:29.388]  I just don't see anything on the horizon.
[01:26:30.049 --> 01:26:32.771]  But, you know, we'll hear it leaking out of Washington.
[01:26:32.791 --> 01:26:34.632]  You know, they have these tanks going.
[01:26:35.292 --> 01:26:36.453]  And they've been going for years.
[01:26:36.473 --> 01:26:48.001]  And, incidentally, that program of guaranteed annuities by the United States government, that's been in formation since 1995.
[01:26:48.981 --> 01:26:50.503]  This is really nothing new.
[01:26:51.003 --> 01:26:57.067]  It's just getting here now, or they pulled it up when they thought they needed it desperately, if you may.
[01:26:59.765 --> 01:27:08.161]  And if they impose a 5% tax for savings, then that probably will help them quite a bit.
[01:27:08.742 --> 01:27:10.385]  But I don't think the public's going to like it much.
[01:27:13.274 --> 01:27:21.522]  When I tell listeners that the government is creating a police state electronic straitjacket over the states, we're not just saying that.
[01:27:21.822 --> 01:27:26.206]  We have the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, reauthorized since 2007.
[01:27:26.927 --> 01:27:28.328]  We have PDD 51.
[01:27:28.368 --> 01:27:29.669]  We have the Council of Governors.
[01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:37.255]  Which is so the President can claim he's in control of the states and, well, the Council of Governors agrees his ten hand-picked minions.
[01:27:37.735 --> 01:27:41.958]  You could have 49 states telling one state they had to do something unconstitutional.
[01:27:42.278 --> 01:27:43.139]  It doesn't stand.
[01:27:44.079 --> 01:27:47.081]  You have NORTHCOM admittedly set up for the American people.
[01:27:47.421 --> 01:27:49.823]  You have them trying to put military on the streets everywhere.
[01:27:50.263 --> 01:27:52.025]  You have them with the naked body scanners.
[01:27:52.485 --> 01:27:58.669]  They're clearly trying to get this grid in place to suppress peaceful revolution.
[01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.730]  I don't
[01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:23.270]  They're still moving forward or maybe they're not humorous, Phil.
[01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:31.375]  Maybe that's why Cass Sunstein and other White House stars write that, quote, the conspiracy theorists are a danger and are hurting them.
[01:28:31.415 --> 01:28:31.935]  Bob Chapman.
[01:28:32.976 --> 01:28:33.696]  Well, that's right.
[01:28:33.896 --> 01:28:35.837]  And I think you hit it on the head.
[01:28:36.438 --> 01:28:42.221]  And I'm doing a piece right now that I'll finish over the weekend for next Wednesday's issue.
[01:28:43.041 --> 01:28:44.802]  And it's control of the Internet.
[01:28:45.422 --> 01:28:49.385]  And, of course, if they go for that through the U.N.
[01:28:49.465 --> 01:28:49.905]  or whatever,
[01:28:50.584 --> 01:28:50.945]  I don't
[01:29:07.848 --> 01:29:13.812]  I think they waited too long or they get rushed into the situation by yourself and others.
[01:29:14.292 --> 01:29:16.254]  Well, the train's already left the station.
[01:29:16.694 --> 01:29:17.154]  Exactly.
[01:29:17.194 --> 01:29:21.597]  We've already told the people, the DVDs, the books, the newsletters are out there.
[01:29:21.978 --> 01:29:26.040]  And the more they try to censor us, the more people want to find out what's going on.
[01:29:26.961 --> 01:29:27.461]  That's right.
[01:29:28.502 --> 01:29:32.665]  You know, it's just like when you try to hide something, there's a reason for it.
[01:29:33.345 --> 01:29:34.666]  You probably did something wrong.
[01:29:35.447 --> 01:29:37.528]  And the Federal Reserve is a wonderful example.
[01:29:39.201 --> 01:29:43.965]  It's a state secret, or you don't have a need to know, and it's a private corporation.
[01:29:44.465 --> 01:29:45.526]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:29:46.267 --> 01:29:48.709]  And so, why is the Fed Reserve doing that?
[01:29:48.769 --> 01:29:55.395]  Why are they battling so hard to keep 1207, which is in that appropriations bill, from getting passed?
[01:29:56.116 --> 01:29:58.658]  Because they don't want everybody to know what they're doing.
[01:29:58.698 --> 01:30:04.643]  Well, the same is true, not only with the Fed, but right through our government, and Wall Street.
[01:30:04.683 --> 01:30:05.784]  I mean, you saw the hearings.
[01:30:08.045 --> 01:30:13.850]  This Lloyd Blankfein gets up and says, well, we're doing God's work, and we made a few mistakes.
[01:30:14.590 --> 01:30:27.442]  Yeah, as they collected hundreds of billions of dollars from the American investor or the American citizen, and they justify that, well, if you don't let us do it, we'll crash the system.
[01:30:28.922 --> 01:30:30.303]  That's really what they're saying.
[01:30:30.723 --> 01:30:32.864]  And I work with these people for 28 years.
[01:30:32.904 --> 01:30:33.964]  I know where they're coming from.
[01:30:34.244 --> 01:30:35.465]  And this is terrorism.
[01:30:35.525 --> 01:30:45.409]  This is illegal financial terrorism that they have been engaging in and they have wrecked hundreds of third world countries and first world nations in the last hundred years.
[01:30:45.509 --> 01:30:51.652]  They will make us destitute and homeless if they are able to successfully pull this off.
[01:30:52.032 --> 01:30:54.293]  This is life and death for our economy.
[01:30:54.853 --> 01:30:59.998]  Our society, our future progeny, this is for all the marbles.
[01:31:00.098 --> 01:31:06.043]  And that's why I get so disgusted by adults who are losing their jobs or getting their pay cut.
[01:31:06.864 --> 01:31:08.666]  Wealthy, poor people, it doesn't matter.
[01:31:09.166 --> 01:31:11.468]  They don't still, many of them, seem to care.
[01:31:11.488 --> 01:31:14.151]  They only care about who's going to win the Super Bowl this Sunday.
[01:31:15.985 --> 01:31:29.893]  That's exactly right, and they ruined many, many personal lives all over the world, particularly with these collateralized debt obligations, which are the bonds which have the mortgages inside of them.
[01:31:30.894 --> 01:31:40.119]  60% of them were sold in Europe, so it's not only American institutions that bought them and lost piles of money, but it was Europeans as well, and others.
[01:31:40.743 --> 01:31:50.728]  But, you know, this, to me, as a professional within that area, is grotesque.
[01:31:50.828 --> 01:31:54.650]  I mean, how could they ever think that they could get away with this?
[01:31:55.510 --> 01:32:06.675]  What they did is they got the Raiders, which is Moody's and Fitch and S&P, to say that this was AAA paper, the best you can buy, when in fact it was a BBB.
[01:32:08.476 --> 01:32:09.757]  And the inclusion
[01:32:10.726 --> 01:32:17.854]  With not only the Raiders, but also the Federal Reserve and the lenders themselves.
[01:32:18.976 --> 01:32:27.846]  And it was a whole group of people who were involved in this giant trillion, multi-trillion dollar scam.
[01:32:29.741 --> 01:32:30.942]  You're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:32:31.542 --> 01:32:46.050]  And now it's come out in McClatchy newspapers and other places, documents they got from Goldman, that they premeditatedly rigged all this to destroy their competition and destroy the economy and come out on top with their insider knowledge.
[01:32:47.071 --> 01:32:49.272]  And now they're trying to bring us into the next phase.
[01:32:49.312 --> 01:32:52.274]  I want to go to Kohl's here, Bob, but
[01:32:54.381 --> 01:33:01.766]  What is going to happen from your past experience and research as people find out the economy is actually getting worse and not better?
[01:33:03.527 --> 01:33:04.767]  Well, we're going to get more disturbed.
[01:33:04.787 --> 01:33:05.948]  There'll be more layoffs.
[01:33:06.788 --> 01:33:08.610]  There'll be more people going bankrupt.
[01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:10.791]  It'll be harder to live.
[01:33:11.751 --> 01:33:17.635]  The way that we've lived over the past, we'll say, 50 years is gone, probably gone forever.
[01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:22.081]  That's hard to say forever, but probably gone forever.
[01:33:22.782 --> 01:33:35.886]  And they are going to demonstrate, and eventually the demonstrations will, if they can't accomplish what they want through Congress, then there will probably be a revolution.
[01:33:38.607 --> 01:33:40.628]  Let's go to phone calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:40.648 --> 01:33:42.249]  Let's talk to John in Illinois.
[01:33:42.269 --> 01:33:43.389]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[01:33:43.922 --> 01:33:57.077]  Hello, I just want to say I appreciate your show, Mr. Jones, and a question I have for Mr. Chapman is, how do you feel that George Soros' statement about gold being in a bubble affected the market currently?
[01:33:57.717 --> 01:34:00.701]  And also, with all the manipulations that the banks do,
[01:34:02.273 --> 01:34:04.935]  Do you think they can control the price of gold for much longer?
[01:34:04.955 --> 01:34:07.197]  Let me add this before Bob answers.
[01:34:07.658 --> 01:34:17.205]  Last Friday here, I played the clip for Bob of Soros on Wednesday of last, bragging that they were about to try to pop the gold bubble.
[01:34:17.965 --> 01:34:19.927]  So, was Soros involved?
[01:34:20.007 --> 01:34:21.248]  What are the central banks doing?
[01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:22.208]  We know it's been exposed.
[01:34:22.228 --> 01:34:23.349]  They do manipulate gold.
[01:34:23.710 --> 01:34:25.391]  Why are they trying to drive gold down right now?
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:29.501]  Well, first of all, George Soros is an arch-criminal.
[01:34:30.061 --> 01:34:31.161]  He's a multi-billionaire.
[01:34:31.181 --> 01:34:32.502]  He's a top-aluminist.
[01:34:33.722 --> 01:34:36.803]  He was convicted of rigging the stock market in France.
[01:34:36.843 --> 01:34:37.883]  He appealed and lost.
[01:34:38.503 --> 01:34:41.604]  And he was convicted in Hungary, as well, in recent years.
[01:34:42.965 --> 01:34:44.225]  He's a front man.
[01:34:44.850 --> 01:34:47.732]  For the Illuminists, whatever they want done, he does it.
[01:34:48.192 --> 01:34:50.654]  In Eastern Europe, they have these colored revolutions.
[01:34:51.074 --> 01:34:52.355]  He was behind the whole thing.
[01:34:52.876 --> 01:34:56.878]  And, of course, when these guys die, all the money goes back to the Illuminists.
[01:34:57.419 --> 01:34:58.259]  That's the way it works.
[01:34:58.279 --> 01:34:59.640]  And by the way, you're not just saying that.
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:00.681]  I want you to continue your point.
[01:35:01.081 --> 01:35:09.427]  It came out in the British news and Russian news that every time Putin arrests an oligarch, it turns out they own literally nothing and everything is Lord Rothschild's.
[01:35:10.339 --> 01:35:10.799]  That's right.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.542]  And Rossile Bank bankrolled the whole thing.
[01:35:13.562 --> 01:35:16.085]  So what are they doing with the gold?
[01:35:17.426 --> 01:35:17.766]  Pardon me?
[01:35:17.786 --> 01:35:21.590]  I mean, I'm interrupting you from the question, the caller's question.
[01:35:21.610 --> 01:35:22.811]  What's going on with the rigging?
[01:35:25.534 --> 01:35:26.595]  And in what sector?
[01:35:27.135 --> 01:35:30.679]  Well, I mean, Soros... What do you mean with the gold?
[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:34.062]  What he was a stocking horse in this...
[01:35:35.434 --> 01:35:35.735]  I think so.
[01:35:51.917 --> 01:35:58.643]  Triple what is normal in the comics and the LBMA, which is the London equivalent, is even worse.
[01:35:59.204 --> 01:36:02.988]  I mean, I think they're short 50 tons of gold and they don't have any.
[01:36:03.328 --> 01:36:08.613]  When does, I mean, for those that don't understand shorting, when are the contracts or the main group of contracts up?
[01:36:08.633 --> 01:36:13.077]  Because now they've got to short it because they already betted in shorting or they'd lose their shirt.
[01:36:14.058 --> 01:36:14.578]  That's right.
[01:36:14.719 --> 01:36:17.061]  And shorting is betting it's going to go down.
[01:36:18.032 --> 01:36:23.274]  And so they've been doing that, but ultimately they have to cover, which means buy it back in again.
[01:36:23.854 --> 01:36:26.435]  And I don't know at what level they're going to do that.
[01:36:26.535 --> 01:36:32.237]  My guess is probably somewhere between $1,033 and perhaps $1,070.
[01:36:32.377 --> 01:36:36.139]  There's a number of reasons that I won't go into.
[01:36:36.159 --> 01:36:44.241]  But he front-ran this attack on gold, and it's the second attack in like two months.
[01:36:46.201 --> 01:36:49.602]  The second part of the question was, can they continue to do it?
[01:36:49.903 --> 01:36:50.883]  And the answer is no.
[01:36:50.923 --> 01:36:55.745]  And the reason why is they don't have the physical bullion to sell into the market.
[01:36:56.185 --> 01:36:58.746]  And that's where they're stopped cold.
[01:36:59.627 --> 01:37:05.249]  And so when they use derivatives futures to go in and drive prices down,
[01:37:07.355 --> 01:37:09.676]  They only can do it for a short period of time.
[01:37:10.136 --> 01:37:12.036]  Several days at the most, and that's it.
[01:37:12.256 --> 01:37:20.338]  And to answer the question, why do they want to drive gold down, am I right in saying because it will expose the weakness of the dollar?
[01:37:21.718 --> 01:37:24.499]  It'll expose the weakness of the dollar and the whole system.
[01:37:25.039 --> 01:37:28.620]  Whenever gold goes up, it's like the canary in the coal mine.
[01:37:29.796 --> 01:37:42.447]  It's the tip-off that something is dramatically wrong in some society, and gold's going up because the society's on the brink, economically, financially, whatever, and that is what's happening.
[01:37:43.027 --> 01:37:44.428]  And so they've been suppressing gold.
[01:37:44.448 --> 01:37:45.389]  They started in 1988.
[01:37:45.729 --> 01:37:56.198]  I wrote my first article for the Bull and Bear saying the market is being manipulated, and I explained how they were doing it, and everybody told me I was insane.
[01:37:56.218 --> 01:37:58.580]  Well, of course, they don't do that anymore.
[01:37:59.463 --> 01:38:07.185]  Because it is common knowledge now, especially on Wall Street, that all markets, but particularly the gold market, is being manipulated.
[01:38:07.585 --> 01:38:09.066]  John, does that answer your questions?
[01:38:11.106 --> 01:38:19.588]  I was just curious to, you know, I know it's impossible to tell, but, you know, because what about silver also?
[01:38:19.608 --> 01:38:25.150]  Do you expect a price, because they're short that market also?
[01:38:26.607 --> 01:38:33.091]  Well, you're right, and there's two big players that are short about 60% of the contracts.
[01:38:33.811 --> 01:38:34.232]  J.P.
[01:38:34.272 --> 01:38:39.014]  Morgan, Chase, and HSBC, Hong Kong-Shanghai Bank.
[01:38:40.075 --> 01:38:40.855]  And it's illegal!
[01:38:41.716 --> 01:38:48.080]  And the CFTC stands there and has allowed it to go on ever since Bill Stearns went under.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:52.482]  So what you're saying they are going to drop, but you're expecting them to drop in silver?
[01:38:54.083 --> 01:38:55.064]  No, it's already happened.
[01:38:55.598 --> 01:38:56.859]  Yeah, but continuing, or?
[01:38:57.899 --> 01:38:58.279]  No, no.
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:05.003]  It'll base out here somewhere in the $15 to $16 area, and gold should base out here as well.
[01:39:06.124 --> 01:39:08.105]  When will gold start running back up?
[01:39:08.885 --> 01:39:10.446]  When do you see gold running back up?
[01:39:12.027 --> 01:39:15.208]  Oh, I think it can happen before June, maybe even before April.
[01:39:16.069 --> 01:39:16.369]  Okay.
[01:39:16.549 --> 01:39:18.690]  They don't have any lasting power.
[01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:22.990]  I mean, they've lost their bullion positions.
[01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:25.711]  They've sold them off over the last 20 years.
[01:39:26.032 --> 01:39:27.793]  They're swimming upstream against the market.
[01:39:27.813 --> 01:39:28.353]  Thank you, John.
[01:39:28.793 --> 01:39:30.934]  Michael in California, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[01:39:31.735 --> 01:39:32.575]  Hey, thank you guys.
[01:39:32.635 --> 01:39:39.719]  It's just so timely you're having this conversation, and now it's your illustration about the rats going up the mast of the crow's nest.
[01:39:39.899 --> 01:39:42.320]  It just really kind of sets there.
[01:39:44.125 --> 01:39:54.869]  I wanted to know if either one of you are familiar with Thomas Horne's latest book, Apollyon Rising, the prophetic cipher hidden from the world by the U.S.
[01:39:54.909 --> 01:39:56.349]  government for over 200 years?
[01:39:57.770 --> 01:39:58.230]  No, I'm not.
[01:39:59.139 --> 01:40:01.380]  No, I'm not.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:03.380]  I would recommend it.
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:14.644]  It's a great overview of why the seal is on the dollar bill and the forces that you guys are talking about that want to see their world order manifest.
[01:40:14.964 --> 01:40:20.726]  Well, we carry three videos, America's Secret Beginnings, that chronicle that, so I am aware of it.
[01:40:20.766 --> 01:40:21.486]  Anything else, Michael?
[01:40:23.157 --> 01:40:31.503]  Well, I'm just wondering also on the provisions front, I know Bob's talked really strongly about being out of the U.S.
[01:40:31.563 --> 01:40:34.025]  dollar as well as having food supplies.
[01:40:34.085 --> 01:40:37.147]  Both of you talk about that way to protect your family.
[01:40:38.835 --> 01:40:48.360]  It's amazing how many people around me, as I try to have conversations with people, really just shy away from it as if it's extreme.
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:50.541]  Well, let me comment on that, Michael, as we're going into break.
[01:40:50.601 --> 01:40:51.962]  They have made it fashionable.
[01:40:52.002 --> 01:40:53.663]  They've been telling people for a hundred years.
[01:40:54.463 --> 01:41:01.045]  Don't talk about politics and religion when talking about politics and religion is what created this country.
[01:41:01.525 --> 01:41:11.348]  And they tell you it's weird to be protected, it's weird to own guns, it's weird to be self-sufficient, it's weird to know how to fish, it's weird to know how to skin a deer.
[01:41:11.808 --> 01:41:16.570]  As a human being, I'm high-tech, I'm modern, but I also am primitive.
[01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:19.854]  I keep those aspects about myself.
[01:41:20.595 --> 01:41:23.519]  I know a little bit about nature and how to be self-sufficient.
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:27.043]  I'm not a domesticated, complete jellyfish.
[01:41:27.644 --> 01:41:32.270]  And so what you've got is domesticated, soft-palmed jellyfish.
[01:41:32.631 --> 01:41:34.353]  Look at Katrina.
[01:41:35.154 --> 01:41:39.256]  Look at California collapsing and making the state workers work one day a week for free.
[01:41:39.736 --> 01:41:40.897]  Look at Haiti.
[01:41:41.237 --> 01:41:44.139]  The government can't and won't and will not take care of you.
[01:41:44.439 --> 01:41:54.884]  And in all these intensifying crises, the fact that people don't even have the basic instinct to want to prepare, like a grasshopper doesn't prepare for the winter, the ant does.
[01:41:55.304 --> 01:41:56.625]  A squirrel prepares for the winter.
[01:41:56.985 --> 01:41:58.386]  I've got the smarts of a squirrel.
[01:41:58.666 --> 01:42:00.207]  Your average football watcher doesn't.
[01:42:00.247 --> 01:42:00.787]  Bob Chapman.
[01:42:02.179 --> 01:42:02.660]  I agree.
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.822]  And you know, it's all there.
[01:42:04.922 --> 01:42:06.563]  All they have to do is start using it.
[01:42:07.224 --> 01:42:09.726]  And how can that come about?
[01:42:10.547 --> 01:42:11.768]  All they have to do is listen.
[01:42:12.569 --> 01:42:14.791]  And your program is one of those ways.
[01:42:15.411 --> 01:42:17.053]  Or my publication for that matter.
[01:42:17.825 --> 01:42:24.208]  And you know, there's a lot of things that just have to be exposed to people and say, oh yeah, I was wondering about that.
[01:42:24.888 --> 01:42:27.129]  And all of a sudden, it clicks in.
[01:42:27.249 --> 01:42:33.831]  I get so many emails and talk to so many people that say, I woke up six months ago, or a year, or two years ago.
[01:42:34.531 --> 01:42:35.632]  And I think that's terrific.
[01:42:35.732 --> 01:42:41.514]  And it's because of The Interdebt, and my publication, and your program, and other programs, and so on.
[01:42:42.394 --> 01:42:43.975]  And we are getting there.
[01:42:44.335 --> 01:42:46.296]  The thing is, can we get there fast enough?
[01:42:47.901 --> 01:42:50.928]  Folks, now is the time of maximum effort.
[01:42:51.068 --> 01:42:55.819]  Now is the time when the globalists are moving against us and the public is finally ready to be enlightened.
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:56.561]  We'll be back.
[01:42:57.526 --> 01:43:02.590]  Hello, at OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:07.433]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[01:43:07.754 --> 01:43:12.557]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[01:43:12.817 --> 01:43:17.461]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[01:43:17.501 --> 01:43:21.584]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[01:43:21.704 --> 01:43:25.886]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[01:43:26.046 --> 01:43:30.508]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:32.550]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[01:43:32.690 --> 01:43:34.751]  I can't say enough about this book.
[01:43:34.851 --> 01:43:36.672]  Blessings to you and your family.
[01:43:36.772 --> 01:43:42.254]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[01:43:42.475 --> 01:43:45.496]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[01:43:45.896 --> 01:43:48.618]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[01:43:49.478 --> 01:43:51.560]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:53.901]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:43:53.921 --> 01:43:55.042]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:44:08.012 --> 01:44:10.673]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:11.433 --> 01:44:16.895]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:17.055 --> 01:44:22.097]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:22.617 --> 01:44:32.241]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:32.361 --> 01:44:34.463]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:34.703 --> 01:44:36.044]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:36.284 --> 01:44:38.566]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:38.746 --> 01:44:40.587]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:40.867 --> 01:44:45.651]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:46.031 --> 01:44:50.795]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:45:00.351 --> 01:45:03.313]  Have you been laid off or had your hours cut?
[01:45:04.094 --> 01:45:05.435]  Are balloon payments coming due?

[01:46:37.359 --> 01:46:38.339]  Or you can get a t-shirt for $5.95,
[01:46:43.422 --> 01:46:46.066]  Which is basically our cost of your choice.
[01:46:46.147 --> 01:46:49.672]  Got a bunch of great Don't Tread on Me, Join or Die, Patriot shirts.
[01:46:49.993 --> 01:46:51.235]  They're available with the special.
[01:46:51.295 --> 01:46:51.896]  It'll ship out.
[01:46:52.691 --> 01:46:55.392]  We're supposed to not ship it until March 8th.
[01:46:56.012 --> 01:46:59.954]  So I'll just tell you that, but we'll have it first and get it out to you later.
[01:46:59.974 --> 01:47:02.454]  And Jesse Ventura is on just a few days after it comes out.
[01:47:03.535 --> 01:47:08.397]  But going back to Bob Chapman, I want to take calls for him in this segment and the next.
[01:47:08.477 --> 01:47:09.137]  And he's leaving us.
[01:47:09.157 --> 01:47:13.578]  I'm going to blitz through a bunch of news and continue with your phone calls.
[01:47:14.539 --> 01:47:16.519]  Right now, let's go to Michael in Texas.
[01:47:16.539 --> 01:47:17.600]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:17.900]  Go ahead.
[01:47:20.478 --> 01:47:21.258]  Oh, he just dropped.
[01:47:21.858 --> 01:47:23.739]  Man, okay, they do that right when you go to them.
[01:47:23.799 --> 01:47:25.199]  Jerry in Indiana, go ahead.
[01:47:25.219 --> 01:47:29.420]  Hey, Alex and Bob Chapman.
[01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:31.600]  Thanks for standing up for liberty and freedom.
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:34.421]  I got a question for Bob here.
[01:47:35.001 --> 01:47:42.602]  You know, I've talked to our congressmen and representatives because things are really bad here in Indiana, unemployment-wise, just like across the nation.
[01:47:43.663 --> 01:47:50.224]  I tell these people, you know, the definition of a third world is a country with no manufacturing base.
[01:47:51.528 --> 01:47:57.090]  Bob, how do they expect to bring jobs back with NAFTA and GATT in place?
[01:47:57.410 --> 01:47:58.611]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:48:00.412 --> 01:48:15.337]  It's not going to happen unless we can change the complexion of Congress and pass tariffs on goods and services like we had since 1800, which helped make America a very strong nation.
[01:48:17.785 --> 01:48:24.829]  Mercantilism is what free trade, globalization, offshoring and outsourcing is all about.
[01:48:25.609 --> 01:48:32.293]  It's carried on by transnational conglomerates that keep their profits offshore and don't pay taxes on them.
[01:48:33.053 --> 01:48:37.476]  And so that's why Congress doesn't want to pass that because they're all paid off by them.
[01:48:37.896 --> 01:48:39.737]  And it's called campaign contributions.
[01:48:40.419 --> 01:48:48.206]  And so, you gotta change Congress, and then we gotta put the axe in, and once we get that passed, everybody in the world's gonna be mad at us.
[01:48:48.246 --> 01:48:49.227]  It's just too bad.
[01:48:49.607 --> 01:48:58.515]  We got the biggest market in the world, and if you have tariffs on things, what's going to happen is the manufacturers have moved out,
[01:48:59.372 --> 01:49:06.416]  Are going to have no advantage of being where they are now, let's say in China, because the tariffs are going to make everything equal.
[01:49:06.637 --> 01:49:07.757]  And let's expand on that.
[01:49:08.117 --> 01:49:13.821]  With environmental rules and regulations, we have a tariff on ourselves against our own goods.
[01:49:14.201 --> 01:49:17.223]  It's not free or fair to compete against Mexico or India.
[01:49:18.844 --> 01:49:21.646]  And you can impound that into the tariff.
[01:49:22.782 --> 01:49:33.750]  You can say, you don't have any environmental controls, and so, instead of charging you 50 cents per item, we're gonna charge you 75 to make up for that.
[01:49:34.571 --> 01:49:36.332]  And then all that money goes in the Treasury.
[01:49:38.034 --> 01:49:43.438]  And that's how we're supposed to fund the country, instead of the stinking income tax that goes to the private banks.
[01:49:44.458 --> 01:49:44.919]  That's right.
[01:49:46.619 --> 01:49:47.299]  Absolutely.
[01:49:47.959 --> 01:49:48.840]  Who knows better?
[01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:52.781]  The bankers that have raped and robbed us or the founding fathers that made America great?
[01:49:53.141 --> 01:49:54.241]  Whose system do we want?
[01:49:54.542 --> 01:50:01.424]  A bunch of fancy bankers come in here and tell us what they're going to do for us and how great it's going to be and it's wrecked us by design.
[01:50:01.644 --> 01:50:03.264]  This is by design.
[01:50:03.564 --> 01:50:05.485]  Any other comments, Jerry in Indiana?
[01:50:06.294 --> 01:50:16.497]  Yes, uh, you know, my dad taught me for me, I'm 56 years old now, but he taught me at a young age, if you back somebody in a corner, they're gonna come out fighting.
[01:50:16.617 --> 01:50:21.959]  What does the New World Order think of 200 million armed civilians, Bob?
[01:50:23.319 --> 01:50:33.122]  They are going to be terrified, and if they bring in foreign troops, I can promise you, our military will make sure that they don't return from whence they came.
[01:50:34.863 --> 01:50:35.283]  We'll be back!
[01:50:39.198 --> 01:50:41.259]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:45.142]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:46.903 --> 01:50:51.146]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:50:51.446 --> 01:50:55.529]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:50:55.789 --> 01:51:01.212]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:51:01.552 --> 01:51:06.836]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:51:07.136 --> 01:51:07.697]  Number 3.
[01:51:07.977 --> 01:51:11.260]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:15.303]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:51:15.484 --> 01:51:16.024]  Number 4.
[01:51:16.264 --> 01:51:18.646]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:51:19.027 --> 01:51:22.430]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:51:22.710 --> 01:51:23.251]  Number 5.
[01:51:23.511 --> 01:51:27.434]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:51:27.655 --> 01:51:32.419]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:51:32.679 --> 01:51:36.662]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:51:36.782 --> 01:51:38.384]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:51:38.584 --> 01:51:40.686]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:51:40.846 --> 01:51:43.188]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:52:01.149 --> 01:52:04.312]  Man, the first three hours have gone by very quickly.
[01:52:04.352 --> 01:52:05.713]  We're in the fourth and final hour.
[01:52:05.793 --> 01:52:07.434]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:52:07.534 --> 01:52:09.236]  I have a special guest joining us.
[01:52:09.616 --> 01:52:10.817]  Surprise guest in studio.
[01:52:10.857 --> 01:52:12.378]  I want to stay with us for that.
[01:52:12.398 --> 01:52:18.724]  I'm going to have Bob Chaffetz stay another 20 minutes with us, because I just really always enjoy talking to Bob, and I know the callers want to talk to him as well.
[01:52:19.084 --> 01:52:20.185]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:52:20.205 --> 01:52:21.066]  And let's go to Mike in New York.
[01:52:21.146 --> 01:52:22.527]  Mike, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:52:29.696 --> 01:52:30.756]  Hi, Alex.
[01:52:30.816 --> 01:52:31.777]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:52:31.797 --> 01:52:34.237]  This is indeed a pleasure.
[01:52:34.277 --> 01:52:35.437]  It's a first-time caller.
[01:52:36.138 --> 01:52:39.818]  I have sort of like two questions regarding the Federal Reserve for Bob.
[01:52:40.158 --> 01:52:52.261]  And what I want to know is, I heard that the Federal Reserve and a lot of the central banks do what's called double booking, where they double up what they say they purport having.
[01:52:53.342 --> 01:52:59.063]  And then the other question that I want to ask you is with regards to if the audit should occur,
[01:52:59.989 --> 01:53:05.691]  And all this unraveling of corruption is unveiled to the masses.
[01:53:06.391 --> 01:53:12.753]  What and how would that impact the gold reserves and the price of gold?
[01:53:15.814 --> 01:53:17.335]  First of all, it'll make gold go up.
[01:53:17.495 --> 01:53:20.396]  And secondly, we don't even know whether they have any gold.
[01:53:20.416 --> 01:53:22.637]  They haven't had an audit since 1954.
[01:53:23.417 --> 01:53:28.859]  And we see over the last couple of years in the general market where
[01:53:29.822 --> 01:53:30.944]  I don't know.
[01:53:49.392 --> 01:53:53.016]  One of the military people in one of the programs said, look, I was guarding it.
[01:53:53.557 --> 01:53:54.598]  There's something there.
[01:53:54.998 --> 01:53:56.340]  I don't know who it belongs to.
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:59.303]  I don't know what's inside the gold-looking bars.
[01:53:59.884 --> 01:54:02.627]  But we guarded them, and I was ahead of the detail.
[01:54:03.167 --> 01:54:04.328]  Well, let me expand on this.
[01:54:04.489 --> 01:54:05.670]  Let me expand on this, though.
[01:54:05.950 --> 01:54:08.793]  For those who don't understand, they had a little bit of copper
[01:54:09.534 --> 01:54:19.338]  Or other, maybe 1% or less, into gold coins so that they're not soft, so the faces don't wear off, and so people can't easily grind them down.
[01:54:19.679 --> 01:54:37.567]  Pure gold melts very easily, deforms very easily, and so yes, gold has shown up between central banks that's supposedly pure gold, like it's supposed to come in the bars, and it's not pure, showing chicaneries going on.
[01:54:37.767 --> 01:54:38.247]  Go ahead, Bob.
[01:54:39.841 --> 01:54:43.284]  And so, we don't know what the U.S.
[01:54:43.324 --> 01:54:43.644]  has.
[01:54:44.125 --> 01:54:47.868]  It would be nice if they had everything they say they have, but we know that's not so.
[01:54:48.569 --> 01:54:50.230]  And this goes back to the late 60s.
[01:54:50.991 --> 01:55:01.060]  Lyndon Johnson, we don't know what he did, and then they had the Rosa bonds, which were all redeemed, which were bonds that were given out and backed by gold, and people took the gold instead of taking the cash.
[01:55:02.587 --> 01:55:04.268]  But, you know, they never reported on it.
[01:55:04.969 --> 01:55:06.711]  All we can do is guess at what they did.
[01:55:07.151 --> 01:55:08.732]  They hide these things all the time.
[01:55:09.233 --> 01:55:12.616]  And the question is, why do they get to be so secretive?
[01:55:13.977 --> 01:55:15.999]  Well, because they're doing something they shouldn't be doing.
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:22.525]  And that brings us back to the first question, which, about the Fed Reserve double-counting, or having double...
[01:55:28.228 --> 01:55:28.829]  Sets of books.
[01:55:30.210 --> 01:55:32.451]  Well, yeah, we could call it two sets of books.
[01:55:32.511 --> 01:55:33.392]  And the answer is yes.
[01:55:33.912 --> 01:55:35.434]  But we won't know until we get there.
[01:55:36.234 --> 01:55:38.936]  And when we get there, the people will be enraged.
[01:55:39.797 --> 01:55:46.142]  And I would think that the other bill that Ron Paul has, which would do away with the Fed, would be passed.
[01:55:46.322 --> 01:55:50.285]  And their responsibilities would be passed back to the U.S.
[01:55:50.345 --> 01:55:54.508]  Treasury, where they laid under the Constitution until the Act of 1916, 1913.
[01:55:59.377 --> 01:56:09.712]  And one of the important things, if that happens, is that we stop the revolving door between Wall Street banking and the U.S.
[01:56:09.752 --> 01:56:12.536]  government, because they really control the government.
[01:56:13.223 --> 01:56:15.705]  I mean, it's a 101 conflict of interest.
[01:56:16.085 --> 01:56:17.526]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[01:56:17.546 --> 01:56:17.987]  Good to hear from you.
[01:56:18.007 --> 01:56:24.652]  We're going to come back and talk to John, Mike, Kathy, Tom, and others, but I want to make a point when we return and get Bob's take on it.
[01:56:25.352 --> 01:56:27.874]  We've seen this Federal Reserve disinfo put out.
[01:56:28.996 --> 01:56:38.622]  Really through the Patriot community, as Cass Sunstein at the White House said, they've lost so much credibility, they have to pose as us to then get any credibility.
[01:56:38.642 --> 01:56:48.327]  And they've been putting out this parrot message over and over again that you better not audit the Fed because you'll get something worse.
[01:56:49.008 --> 01:56:50.408]  You can't get something worse.
[01:56:50.468 --> 01:56:53.910]  We're already under a financial dictatorship of these people.
[01:56:54.190 --> 01:56:54.771]  We'll be right back.
[01:56:57.574 --> 01:57:00.176]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:57:00.576 --> 01:57:05.540]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:07.641]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:57:07.961 --> 01:57:12.784]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:57:12.965 --> 01:57:13.925]  How much do you want?
[01:57:14.145 --> 01:57:14.886]  When do you want it?
[01:57:15.266 --> 01:57:16.867]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:57:17.147 --> 01:57:17.988]  When will you need it?
[01:57:18.228 --> 01:57:20.290]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:21.531]  Will there be any food?
[01:57:21.771 --> 01:57:23.112]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:57:23.292 --> 01:57:23.652]  If there's a
[01:57:23.712 --> 01:57:25.675]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:57:25.835 --> 01:57:28.358]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:57:28.559 --> 01:57:31.743]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:57:32.144 --> 01:57:35.649]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:57:35.969 --> 01:57:36.950]  How much will you need?
[01:57:37.191 --> 01:57:37.812]  We don't know.
[01:57:38.092 --> 01:57:39.013]  How much do you want?
[01:57:39.214 --> 01:57:39.935]  All you can get.
[01:57:40.135 --> 01:57:40.816]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:41.216 --> 01:57:41.417]  I think.
[01:57:56.579 --> 01:58:03.422]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:58:03.562 --> 01:58:04.803]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[01:58:57.739 --> 01:58:58.319]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:58:58.620 --> 01:59:04.120]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[01:59:04.741 --> 01:59:10.562]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[01:59:11.242 --> 01:59:14.502]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[01:59:15.142 --> 01:59:18.363]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[01:59:19.039 --> 01:59:22.402]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[01:59:23.022 --> 01:59:27.525]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[01:59:28.246 --> 01:59:30.208]  We will still have two regrets.
[01:59:30.888 --> 01:59:34.231]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[01:59:34.891 --> 01:59:37.813]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[01:59:38.574 --> 01:59:43.958]  Putting off emergency food preparations will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[01:59:44.770 --> 01:59:45.030]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:59:45.110 --> 01:59:46.471]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:46.491 --> 01:59:46.671]  800-409-5633.
[01:59:46.731 --> 01:59:50.632]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:07.913 --> 02:00:14.396]  Rhett Beckman talked about yesterday the fact that we've really been fully under the New World Order since the mid-eighties.
[02:00:14.436 --> 02:00:15.396]  The U.S.
[02:00:15.416 --> 02:00:23.220]  has been seized and used as a weapon, an engine of tyranny worldwide, and we've been given tyranny here domestically as well.
[02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:27.342]  We're being treated like the third world nations that the private banks have fraudulently conquered.
[02:00:29.008 --> 02:00:35.759]  The Federal Reserve is just a holding company front for the top less than 10 banks.
[02:00:35.799 --> 02:00:38.363]  It was 10 back at the time of the Federal Reserve Act.
[02:00:38.744 --> 02:00:41.248]  It's been very secretive, but some of that information's come out.
[02:00:42.145 --> 02:00:48.887]  And they're partners with the Bank of England, they're partners with the Bundesbank, they coordinate through the G20, they don't even deny this anymore.
[02:00:49.707 --> 02:01:03.732]  And so you abolish the Federal Reserve, you put the power back under the Congress, which is in the Constitution, and you educate the public about the issuance of currency and credit, and you turn credit loose to be an engine for the population.
[02:01:04.773 --> 02:01:15.378]  You know, it came out over a decade ago, the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports that they set up in the early fifties in Chicago, and by the seventies became the model of the country and the world.
[02:01:15.498 --> 02:01:19.100]  Australia has them, England has them, Germany has them, Canada has it.
[02:01:19.701 --> 02:01:23.643]  And so they use lawyer tricks to distract the public.
[02:01:23.703 --> 02:01:28.445]  They say, oh well on budget we've got a budget shortfall, or on budget we need more taxes.
[02:01:28.905 --> 02:01:34.188]  When the budget generally is less than about fifteen percent, and that's just a dead reckoning estimation,
[02:01:34.588 --> 02:01:43.191]  Of the state of Texas, Travis County where I live, similar around other parts of the country and the world.
[02:01:43.211 --> 02:01:50.534]  You know, some places the budget's 30% compared to the real assets of the comprehensive annual financial report.
[02:01:50.574 --> 02:01:56.937]  We have a DVD documentary I produced called comprehensive annual financial reports exposed.
[02:01:59.494 --> 02:02:11.904]  Once we started exposing this in the late nineties, with Walter Berrien and others, and Bob and many others exposing it, these were public before, but in the age of the internet, they're now making most of it secret.
[02:02:12.164 --> 02:02:13.545]  But you can still see the summaries.
[02:02:14.426 --> 02:02:18.769]  And so what you have is the state of Texas, or the University of Texas.
[02:02:18.789 --> 02:02:19.670]  These are just examples.
[02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:24.414]  Where last time I checked, the University of Texas had 50 plus billion dollars
[02:02:25.154 --> 02:02:28.337]  In assets separate from their oil and gas and land holdings?
[02:02:28.857 --> 02:02:30.919]  Because in Texas, the feds don't own much property.
[02:02:31.139 --> 02:02:32.420]  The state of Texas owns a bunch.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:34.562]  And it goes to the university funds.
[02:02:34.882 --> 02:02:36.203]  But that's separate even from that.
[02:02:36.263 --> 02:02:40.827]  They take that money and they put it in Clear Channel Radio, for an example.
[02:02:40.867 --> 02:02:43.809]  They put it in the Rangers baseball team.
[02:02:44.529 --> 02:02:46.151]  They put it in defense contractors.
[02:02:46.191 --> 02:02:49.393]  They put it in all sorts of programs.
[02:02:49.413 --> 02:02:52.115]  They invest it in carbon credit allotments.
[02:02:52.876 --> 02:02:56.217]  And so they're taking your money and then giving it to private interests.
[02:02:56.237 --> 02:03:01.339]  So people who say, oh, we better not get rid of the Federal Reserve, we'll get something worse.
[02:03:01.659 --> 02:03:03.220]  You can't get something worse.
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:10.323]  We have a dictatorship of the private banks controlling our economy and feeding our wealth into their systems.
[02:03:10.523 --> 02:03:16.025]  And then they have control of the insider trading and selectively enforce and allow them and their cronies to do this.
[02:03:18.866 --> 02:03:29.029]  Could, if we start auditing the Fed and get ready to abolish it, yeah, they're going to come back with some new thing that gives them the same power again, but they already have unlimited fraudulent power.
[02:03:29.229 --> 02:03:30.789]  So you can't get anything worse.
[02:03:31.509 --> 02:03:39.912]  You get into the Fed, as Bernanke's admitted, that would destroy the Fed because it's so corrupt, you will further discredit them and send them all to prison.
[02:03:40.232 --> 02:03:47.154]  So anybody that says, and I hear this mantra, don't audit the Fed, Ron Paul's bad, it is pure baloney.
[02:03:47.374 --> 02:03:48.014]  Bob Chapman.
[02:03:49.329 --> 02:03:50.370]  I couldn't have said it better.
[02:03:50.430 --> 02:03:51.251]  You covered it all.
[02:03:52.072 --> 02:03:54.394]  You hit it right on the head, and that's the way it's bent.
[02:03:54.474 --> 02:03:59.238]  And you know, this goes all the way back to the 12th century that we know of.
[02:04:00.119 --> 02:04:02.982]  Most recorded history only goes back to the 7th century.
[02:04:03.783 --> 02:04:07.106]  But beyond there, it's smattering until you get into the Renaissance.
[02:04:09.878 --> 02:04:10.899]  This is nothing new.
[02:04:11.279 --> 02:04:13.660]  This has been done over and over and over again.
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:18.143]  And that's how I'm able to back into what these people will do next.
[02:04:18.503 --> 02:04:20.964]  Because all you have to do is look at history and what they did before.
[02:04:21.304 --> 02:04:22.445]  They're monopoly men.
[02:04:22.745 --> 02:04:37.373]  If they can get control of the government and the issuance of currency and credit, as the Rothschilds constantly said and put on the doorways of their houses, that as long as we control the issuance of currency and credit, I don't care who the king is.
[02:04:41.565 --> 02:04:44.647]  And they create money to finance the King's wars.
[02:04:46.788 --> 02:04:49.970]  And they finance the King's enemies, so they've got to come to them.
[02:04:51.171 --> 02:04:51.692]  That's right.
[02:04:52.872 --> 02:04:54.493]  Both sides of every conflict.
[02:04:55.394 --> 02:04:57.115]  Saddam Hussein, CIA.
[02:04:57.395 --> 02:04:58.836]  Bin Laden, CIA.
[02:04:59.717 --> 02:05:01.438]  Fidel Castro, CIA.
[02:05:01.858 --> 02:05:02.779]  It's all staged.
[02:05:02.879 --> 02:05:04.520]  Pol Pot, CIA.
[02:05:04.780 --> 02:05:06.481]  Brzezinski brags about it.
[02:05:09.713 --> 02:05:12.734]  And he's one of the main architects, along with Henry Kissinger.
[02:05:13.854 --> 02:05:15.135]  Fortunately, they're getting old.
[02:05:15.155 --> 02:05:19.596]  But there'll be people there to take their place, that's for sure.
[02:05:19.897 --> 02:05:24.918]  I want to go to Mike, Kathy, Tom and Kevin quickly here, Bob, but who are the new Super Gophers?
[02:05:24.938 --> 02:05:25.959]  Because we really don't see...
[02:05:27.359 --> 02:05:36.604]  Richard Holbrook or somebody like that, Rahm Emanuel, replacing the super gophers of the elite.
[02:05:36.624 --> 02:05:39.666]  Who do you see to replace David Rockefeller and people like that?
[02:05:39.686 --> 02:05:42.467]  It's a hard call right now.
[02:05:43.468 --> 02:05:44.428]  I just can't answer that.
[02:05:44.748 --> 02:05:45.229]  I don't know.
[02:05:46.789 --> 02:05:48.550]  Me neither.
[02:05:48.590 --> 02:05:51.812]  It seems like those old timers were a lot more hard working.
[02:05:52.152 --> 02:05:55.414]  You talk to more modern globalists and they really seem soft.
[02:05:57.850 --> 02:06:08.798]  Well it's certainly not aggressive, and we certainly don't know who's being groomed, or which ones are being groomed, and it's generally kept from us.
[02:06:09.659 --> 02:06:19.747]  And most of the people we know who are involved now at the upper level, or the semi-upper level, they're usually from 65 years old onward.
[02:06:20.528 --> 02:06:24.571]  Occasionally they'll be 55 or onward, but they're usually older men.
[02:06:26.291 --> 02:06:28.473]  Let's talk to John in Florida and Mike and others.
[02:06:28.513 --> 02:06:29.113]  Go ahead, John.
[02:06:30.134 --> 02:06:31.254]  Hi, thanks for having me.
[02:06:31.595 --> 02:06:32.655]  I got a couple questions.
[02:06:33.896 --> 02:06:44.224]  As far as if we have a revolution and what have you and we totally destroy the tyrannical government we have in place, what happens to our money we have in savings?
[02:06:45.322 --> 02:06:47.183]  As far as the dollar, do we go with the dollar?
[02:06:47.443 --> 02:06:49.124]  Well, that's how they hold us hostage.
[02:06:49.144 --> 02:06:59.088]  We've had a 98% evaluation since 1913, and it's just like a bad employee or, you know, sometimes a mean husband that's beating you up.
[02:06:59.168 --> 02:06:59.948]  You've just got to leave.
[02:07:00.368 --> 02:07:01.829]  I mean, it's going to be rough either way.
[02:07:01.849 --> 02:07:02.269]  Bob Chapman.
[02:07:03.389 --> 02:07:11.973]  Well, if you've got money in the bank and in the general stock market and in bonds, you're going to lose a lot of money, maybe all of it.
[02:07:12.753 --> 02:07:14.974]  The only safe place to be is the gold and silver.
[02:07:18.072 --> 02:07:20.715]  Alright, go ahead.
[02:07:20.795 --> 02:07:31.705]  With this Federal Reserve thing, I was speaking with a banker the other day, and they couldn't enlighten me on the fact, but I see with my savings account, we get under a quarter percent interest for savings.
[02:07:32.446 --> 02:07:39.432]  In turn, the bank loans me somebody else's money, which is the way the money is that they give me in loans, at 3% to 18%.
[02:07:41.852 --> 02:07:48.416]  And how is it legal for them to do that, with the Federal Reserve having the interest rate set at 0.25%?
[02:07:48.696 --> 02:07:52.698]  Because that low rate is for the bankers, not for you, Bob Chapman.
[02:07:53.619 --> 02:07:54.159]  That's right.
[02:07:55.100 --> 02:08:06.106]  And incidentally, you may not be borrowing your neighbor's deposit, because the banks, historically, have created 8 to 10 times more
[02:08:08.496 --> 02:08:11.218]  Credit than what they have in deposits.
[02:08:11.498 --> 02:08:11.838]  That's right.
[02:08:11.858 --> 02:08:12.899]  You're paying interest.
[02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:26.647]  And recently, during this last go-around, they got 40 to 50 to 60 to 70 times basic deposits.
[02:08:26.987 --> 02:08:30.189]  And they had to know that they were going to get in trouble.
[02:08:30.810 --> 02:08:31.490]  Yeah, to explain that.
[02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:32.271]  And it's stupid.
[02:08:32.931 --> 02:08:33.732]  To explain that.
[02:08:34.648 --> 02:08:40.532]  They're charging people with credit cards, in many cases, 25-30% interest on literally made-up money.
[02:08:40.992 --> 02:08:41.232]  Okay?
[02:08:41.453 --> 02:08:45.996]  So they want you to default so that they get your real assets and get control of you.
[02:08:46.036 --> 02:08:47.076]  The name of the game is control.
[02:08:47.116 --> 02:08:47.637]  Thank you, John.
[02:08:47.997 --> 02:08:48.837]  Mike in Wyoming.
[02:08:48.858 --> 02:08:49.638]  You're on the air, Mike.
[02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:53.741]  Yes, hi, Alex, Bob.
[02:08:54.621 --> 02:08:59.044]  Bob, are you keeping up with this UBS situation versus the IRS?
[02:09:00.859 --> 02:09:01.960]  Yeah, the Swiss government.
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:02.640]  Right.
[02:09:02.780 --> 02:09:10.024]  And the Swiss government's come back unofficially and said, well, you know, UBS under the law in Switzerland can't do that.
[02:09:10.945 --> 02:09:24.272]  And another prominent person within the Swiss government says, well, if you do that and make them expose these people, well, the biggest bank in the country is going to go under.
[02:09:24.292 --> 02:09:25.693]  Yeah, that was Times of London.
[02:09:26.993 --> 02:09:29.095]  And thousands of people are going to be unemployed, etc.
[02:09:30.496 --> 02:09:31.416]  And he's right.
[02:09:32.577 --> 02:09:35.977]  And you know, they let Switzerland do what they did for many, many years.
[02:09:36.457 --> 02:09:44.799]  People brought wealth to Switzerland to have it professionally managed, but also to avoid onerous taxation by different countries.
[02:09:45.799 --> 02:09:50.360]  And by the way, they are selectively looting those offshore bank accounts.
[02:09:50.741 --> 02:09:53.421]  All the big boys do whatever they want offshore and don't get touched.
[02:09:53.761 --> 02:09:56.762]  They want to rob people that got a few million dollars or whatever.
[02:09:58.604 --> 02:09:59.545]  And you're right about that.
[02:09:59.585 --> 02:10:00.566]  I lived in Switzerland.
[02:10:01.046 --> 02:10:02.067]  I know the mentality.
[02:10:02.087 --> 02:10:04.950]  In fact, I went to school at the Université de Genève.
[02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:07.432]  I took the interpreter's course for French.
[02:10:08.413 --> 02:10:16.720]  And so living in Switzerland for three years, speaking both French and German, you get a pretty good idea of where people are coming from.
[02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:21.244]  And you've got to remember that during the war, they cooperated fully with Germany.
[02:10:22.365 --> 02:10:23.546]  And when Germany
[02:10:24.538 --> 02:10:43.890]  Uh, wanted to get things that they couldn't get otherwise the Swiss would help them do it or manufacture it for them and they would store much of the stolen things that were taken from people who, uh, were put into camps and, uh, uh, it was dreadful what they did.
[02:10:44.370 --> 02:10:45.211]  Really dreadful.
[02:10:47.512 --> 02:10:48.333]  Anything else, Mike?
[02:10:49.153 --> 02:10:53.276]  Yeah, my question is, is there a safe haven these days if, uh, if the Swiss are gone?
[02:10:55.161 --> 02:10:59.222]  No, there's no... I don't think there's any safe havens left.
[02:11:00.522 --> 02:11:02.943]  I mean, you should have your money where you live.
[02:11:04.143 --> 02:11:07.144]  That's why they call it... You should have the bulk of your assets in gold and silver.
[02:11:07.504 --> 02:11:09.004]  That's why they call it the New World Order.
[02:11:09.024 --> 02:11:09.764]  There's nowhere to run.
[02:11:09.784 --> 02:11:12.085]  Alright, thank you.
[02:11:12.905 --> 02:11:13.425]  Thank you, Mike.
[02:11:13.765 --> 02:11:15.886]  Bob, I'm going to twist your arm to do five more minutes.
[02:11:15.946 --> 02:11:16.406]  Is that cool?
[02:11:17.523 --> 02:11:18.083]  Of course it is.
[02:11:18.444 --> 02:11:19.685]  All right, well if you've got to go, I understand.
[02:11:19.985 --> 02:11:26.970]  We're going to go to break then, come right back to you and try to get to Kathy, Tom, Kevin and John if we have time as quickly as possible.
[02:11:27.991 --> 02:11:33.535]  And then I'm going to news blitz and cover some other key issues in the last 30 minutes of this radio broadcast today.

[02:12:09.279 --> 02:12:15.101]  You know, some of our life-change tea customers forget to order and then they ask us for some rush shipping.
[02:12:15.501 --> 02:12:17.122]  What if it was automatic?
[02:12:17.582 --> 02:12:23.304]  You know, no gimmicks, just your product smooth sailing to you automatically.

[02:12:57.873 --> 02:12:58.713]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:12:58.893 --> 02:13:04.237]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:13:04.417 --> 02:13:04.837]  I get it.
[02:13:04.958 --> 02:13:14.284]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:13:14.604 --> 02:13:15.725]  That's not what's happening.
[02:13:15.985 --> 02:13:24.231]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:13:24.451 --> 02:13:27.733]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:13:27.853 --> 02:13:31.936]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:13:32.116 --> 02:13:33.697]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:13:33.737 --> 02:13:36.959]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:41.282]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:13:41.482 --> 02:13:42.182]  You should, too.
[02:13:42.382 --> 02:13:43.363]  Find out what they know.
[02:13:43.523 --> 02:13:46.765]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:13:46.785 --> 02:13:46.825]  800-686-2237.
[02:13:46.845 --> 02:13:46.885]  800-686-2237.
[02:13:46.905 --> 02:13:47.385]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:13:47.405 --> 02:13:49.966]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:13:49.986 --> 02:13:51.687]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:13:51.727 --> 02:13:53.148]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:14:07.876 --> 02:14:10.519]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:14:10.539 --> 02:14:16.785]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:14:16.945 --> 02:14:22.470]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:14:22.490 --> 02:14:32.119]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:14:32.239 --> 02:14:34.340]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:14:34.580 --> 02:14:35.901]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:14:36.161 --> 02:14:38.462]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:14:38.622 --> 02:14:40.463]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:14:40.763 --> 02:14:45.566]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:14:57.759 --> 02:15:04.082]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[02:15:04.462 --> 02:15:10.564]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:15:10.844 --> 02:15:16.847]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[02:15:17.187 --> 02:15:22.089]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[02:15:22.569 --> 02:15:30.417]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:15:30.737 --> 02:15:34.901]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[02:15:35.342 --> 02:15:39.065]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:15:39.986 --> 02:15:45.554]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.

[02:16:08.292 --> 02:16:21.104]  Hi, how are you Bob and Alex?
[02:16:21.184 --> 02:16:22.526]  I wanted to share a little secret.
[02:16:23.086 --> 02:16:28.571]  We gave up our Saints season tickets this year in order to finance our radio show.
[02:16:29.012 --> 02:16:30.273]  That's how dedicated we were.
[02:16:31.134 --> 02:16:34.417]  We were able to share the whole truth with New Orleans.
[02:16:34.850 --> 02:16:37.351]  About the Fed, Cap-and-Trade, Copenhagen.
[02:16:37.672 --> 02:16:44.996]  We were able to save countless number of people of not taking the slime flu shot and was worth every penny.
[02:16:46.256 --> 02:16:53.881]  You know it's funny you brought that up, Kathy, because in the next segment I was going to talk about boycotting the Super Bowl.
[02:16:55.683 --> 02:16:59.366]  And I'll explain why when we come back, but you just crystallized it.
[02:16:59.726 --> 02:17:06.812]  Swine flu shot killing people, full of mercury, economy falling apart, our country sliding into depression.
[02:17:07.433 --> 02:17:19.983]  And it's not that the Super Bowl is bad, it's that we better make some sacrifices and get our heads screwed on straight for real issues, or we're going to lose it all and be like Argentina or Nigeria.
[02:17:20.023 --> 02:17:20.624]  Bob Chapman.
[02:17:22.365 --> 02:17:23.766]  Well, I think you're absolutely right.
[02:17:25.171 --> 02:17:37.934]  This is a way to do it, and it's about time people turned away from the frivialities of the social life of America, in fact, worldwide.
[02:17:38.454 --> 02:17:40.514]  You've got to get serious about what's going on.
[02:17:41.674 --> 02:17:45.255]  It's very, very bad, and it's not going to get better, it's going to get worse.
[02:17:45.555 --> 02:17:49.076]  You've got to change your priorities.
[02:17:49.496 --> 02:17:53.457]  How much were you able to sell season tickets for?
[02:17:54.784 --> 02:17:56.605]  No, we didn't even sell them, we gave them up.
[02:17:56.665 --> 02:18:01.489]  Because we had, this was our goal, to get this radio talk show.
[02:18:02.109 --> 02:18:12.596]  We didn't have sponsors at the time, with Patriot Radio, and we didn't have a sponsor at the time, and we had a chance to get a radio spot, so we didn't even sell it.
[02:18:12.616 --> 02:18:16.059]  We gave them up, not even, you know, thinking of that.
[02:18:16.159 --> 02:18:24.024]  Now, you know, hindsight, we wish that we would have sold them, but we were so, we were so dedicated at the time, because if you remember, last March,
[02:18:24.505 --> 02:18:29.629]  That's when we started hearing the information about the swine flu and what was going to happen.
[02:18:29.969 --> 02:18:35.693]  And we felt like we had to get on the ground floor so we could tell people, you know, not to take the shots.
[02:18:35.853 --> 02:18:37.114]  You know, I recognize your voice.
[02:18:37.154 --> 02:18:41.017]  Didn't you and your partner come visit me at the office?
[02:18:41.637 --> 02:18:42.238]  We did.
[02:18:42.418 --> 02:18:45.520]  On his birthday, you let us in.
[02:18:45.540 --> 02:18:46.441]  It was just so cool.
[02:18:46.481 --> 02:18:50.744]  You gave him a CD for his birthday.
[02:18:51.366 --> 02:18:52.707]  And you encourage this.
[02:18:52.827 --> 02:18:56.450]  And you know, in the beginning, it's not really easy to get a sponsor.
[02:18:56.491 --> 02:19:06.779]  Now we're with Ecolablue and we love them and we have a great relationship and we talk to Dr. Reema Labo every week and it's just great.
[02:19:06.879 --> 02:19:11.103]  But you know, that first step out in faith, you have to do it.
[02:19:11.263 --> 02:19:12.024]  You have to do it.
[02:19:12.315 --> 02:19:13.536]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[02:19:13.576 --> 02:19:19.061]  Yeah, I've always encouraged my listeners to go buy Saturday or Sunday time to start with.
[02:19:19.081 --> 02:19:27.648]  And if you do it a few months, you normally get enough listeners to get a few sponsors to then finance yourself to wake up tens of thousands in your town or city.
[02:19:27.708 --> 02:19:30.410]  And if I remember correctly, they're on a pretty big station in New Orleans.
[02:19:30.850 --> 02:19:32.452]  You know, start a website, whatever.
[02:19:32.752 --> 02:19:34.653]  It's about everybody being leaders.
[02:19:35.014 --> 02:19:37.115]  And that's what I've always tried to facilitate.
[02:19:37.536 --> 02:19:41.099]  Or get an access TV show or start a local newspaper or newsletter.
[02:19:41.799 --> 02:19:45.642]  Again, it's about empowering everyone to take action, Bob.
[02:19:45.662 --> 02:19:53.789]  Everybody listens to Glenn Beck, and we are going to fight to get them to come on our side.
[02:19:54.329 --> 02:19:56.651]  And this is worthy of fighting.
[02:19:56.671 --> 02:19:57.812]  Well, Kathy, that's great news.
[02:19:58.173 --> 02:20:00.755]  Let me jam in one quick more call for Bob Chapman.
[02:20:01.155 --> 02:20:02.256]  A quick question for Bob.
[02:20:02.596 --> 02:20:04.097]  Tom in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:20:04.137 --> 02:20:04.538]  Go ahead.
[02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:06.541]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[02:20:06.981 --> 02:20:16.526]  Hey, with the $1.5 trillion deficit that we've got, and they're going to refinance $2 trillion of short-term Treasuries coming due, how are they going to do this?
[02:20:16.586 --> 02:20:19.228]  Are they going to have a $300 billion auction?
[02:20:20.269 --> 02:20:21.309]  What's Bernanke going to do?
[02:20:21.369 --> 02:20:22.170]  How is he going to flow that?
[02:20:22.190 --> 02:20:23.430]  They're going to monetize it.
[02:20:23.450 --> 02:20:25.872]  They're going to buy it themselves with SDRs, right, Bob?
[02:20:33.206 --> 02:20:34.587]  Yeah, we lose Bob's line.
[02:20:34.607 --> 02:20:40.910]  He's not in the United States sometimes, but I can... We'll have him back on next week, or if he calls back in, we'll say bye to him.
[02:20:41.771 --> 02:20:45.913]  But absolutely, Tom, I mean, they're going to have to monetize it.
[02:20:45.933 --> 02:20:47.494]  The Federal Reserve's going to buy it itself.
[02:20:48.154 --> 02:20:50.255]  That's kind of like the snake eating its tail, isn't it?
[02:20:51.476 --> 02:20:58.460]  Right, but when they're putting out Treasury auctions at $1.3 billion, they're going to have to start doubling this stuff.
[02:20:58.888 --> 02:21:00.069]  Let me get Bob to answer the question.
[02:21:00.089 --> 02:21:00.969]  Bob, your line dropped.
[02:21:01.490 --> 02:21:09.855]  Real fast, how is the Fed, when it offers trillions of dollars of... I mean, ask your question again, caller.
[02:21:10.716 --> 02:21:18.601]  Look, we've got a $1.5 trillion deficit, and he's got to refinance another $2 trillion that are coming due in short-term Treasuries.
[02:21:18.621 --> 02:21:22.084]  That's $3.5 trillion they're going to have to auction off this coming year.
[02:21:22.104 --> 02:21:23.645]  And who's going to buy it?
[02:21:23.845 --> 02:21:25.266]  They're going to monetize it, aren't they, Bob?
[02:21:26.675 --> 02:21:27.816]  They will, yes.
[02:21:28.277 --> 02:21:30.238]  And that's why they're after the retirement plans.
[02:21:31.119 --> 02:21:31.399]  All right.
[02:21:31.940 --> 02:21:32.980]  I want you to be able to finish this.
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.883]  We're going to do two minutes on the other side with Bob and plug how you get the international forecaster.
[02:21:36.903 --> 02:21:38.545]  Stay there, Bob, since your line dropped.
[02:21:38.585 --> 02:21:42.828]  I want you to be able to explain what this means to have monetization of debt.
[02:21:43.308 --> 02:21:44.149]  This is a big deal.
[02:21:44.189 --> 02:21:46.511]  This is what they just did in Venezuela.
[02:21:47.472 --> 02:21:48.392]  We're on the march.
[02:21:48.873 --> 02:21:50.494]  The empire's on the run.
[02:21:51.415 --> 02:21:54.077]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.854 --> 02:22:01.097]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:22:01.397 --> 02:22:02.038]  Number one.
[02:22:02.318 --> 02:22:05.460]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:22:05.740 --> 02:22:06.321]  Number two.
[02:22:06.601 --> 02:22:11.164]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:22:11.504 --> 02:22:11.965]  It's true.
[02:22:12.245 --> 02:22:16.788]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:22:17.108 --> 02:22:17.648]  Number 3.
[02:22:17.929 --> 02:22:21.211]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:22:21.511 --> 02:22:25.253]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:22:25.434 --> 02:22:25.974]  Number 4.
[02:22:26.234 --> 02:22:28.596]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:22:28.996 --> 02:22:32.378]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:22:32.678 --> 02:22:32.879]  Number 5.
[02:22:33.459 --> 02:22:37.382]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:22:37.602 --> 02:22:42.365]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:23:06.078 --> 02:23:07.499]  As we're finishing off this agenda,

[02:23:34.902 --> 02:23:36.223]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:23:36.484 --> 02:23:38.806]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:23:38.946 --> 02:23:40.788]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.

[02:24:54.639 --> 02:24:56.143]  Part of the revolution today.
[02:25:02.634 --> 02:25:06.755]  Okay, finishing up with Bob Chapman, jamming in a few more calls for him while he's with us.
[02:25:07.396 --> 02:25:11.877]  Bob, explain to people what it means when they start monetizing debt.
[02:25:11.897 --> 02:25:18.739]  I mean, I'm correct in saying that's what we've seen in Zimbabwe and we just saw that in Venezuela.
[02:25:19.079 --> 02:25:24.141]  They've been monetizing debt the last four years and they just devalued their currency last month by 50%.
[02:25:25.061 --> 02:25:29.042]  They're talking about another 50% cut next year.
[02:25:29.062 --> 02:25:30.883]  I mean, explain to people what that means.
[02:25:32.443 --> 02:25:36.604]  What it means is that the Federal Reserve creates money out of thin air.
[02:25:37.305 --> 02:25:39.005]  And let's say it's a trillion dollars.
[02:25:40.025 --> 02:25:41.886]  And that money goes somewhere.
[02:25:42.466 --> 02:26:01.552]  And the minute the money is used, like in purchasing Treasury bills, or purchasing agency securities, Fannie, Freddie, Ginnie, and FHA, or by buying toxic waste, which are the bonds which contain mortgages, that money goes into the system.
[02:26:02.159 --> 02:26:06.622]  In a minute it gets used, it's monetization, and it's very inflationary.
[02:26:07.022 --> 02:26:16.628]  And that's what happened in Zimbabwe and Weimar Germany, recently in Venezuela, usually by governments that have mishandled their government and their finances.
[02:26:17.248 --> 02:26:18.349]  And so where does it lead?
[02:26:18.389 --> 02:26:19.729]  It leads to devaluation.
[02:26:20.490 --> 02:26:27.914]  And I think there is a chance in the next year and a half that there could be an official devaluation of the U.S.
[02:26:27.994 --> 02:26:30.696]  dollar in congruity
[02:26:31.238 --> 02:26:34.979]  With other nations, they'd have a meeting to do that, as they have in the past.
[02:26:35.539 --> 02:26:41.040]  And also, a debt settlement among nations, probably on the order of about 30 cents on the dollar.
[02:26:41.580 --> 02:26:42.641]  And I think that's coming.
[02:26:43.261 --> 02:26:45.381]  And a lot of people say, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:26:45.982 --> 02:26:47.422]  But they're going to have to do it.
[02:26:47.442 --> 02:26:48.782]  They're not going to have any choice.
[02:26:49.302 --> 02:26:53.843]  And we had the caller earlier saying, if I get rid of the Federal Reserve, it may devalue my money in the bank.
[02:26:54.143 --> 02:26:55.804]  They're the ones that are doing it!
[02:26:57.624 --> 02:26:58.685]  Can the Federal Reserve?
[02:26:58.745 --> 02:27:00.505]  No, it's not worth the paper they're written on.
[02:27:01.541 --> 02:27:03.122]  There are only confidence notes.
[02:27:03.583 --> 02:27:10.367]  And the minute the confidence is lost, and that's in the process of happening, not only here in America, but throughout Europe, as you've just seen.
[02:27:11.428 --> 02:27:24.137]  And so this kind of thing will lead internationally to a multilateral devaluation, perhaps of all currencies, or revaluation.
[02:27:24.958 --> 02:27:26.919]  Some currencies will go up against others.
[02:27:27.609 --> 02:27:33.433]  But the key is, they're all going to go down against gold.
[02:27:37.116 --> 02:27:40.758]  Because gold hasn't really gone up, it's just the currencies have gone down.
[02:27:42.379 --> 02:27:43.080]  That's correct.
[02:27:44.041 --> 02:27:48.163]  And the currencies have gone down, the dollar will take as an example.
[02:27:48.724 --> 02:27:55.789]  Officially, since 1980 when gold was $8.50, it should be selling on an official basis vis-a-vis
[02:27:56.861 --> 02:28:03.143]  The inflation during that period of time, about $2,400 an ounce, and is selling for $1,066.
[02:28:04.004 --> 02:28:15.008]  And so, the central banks have been responsible for the suppression of gold for the last 22 years, officially and legally.
[02:28:18.450 --> 02:28:19.030]  Incredible.
[02:28:19.570 --> 02:28:20.610]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:28:21.891 --> 02:28:27.052]  Bob, I'm going to let you punch out here unless you want to go ahead and just go all the way to the 50 and take a few more calls.
[02:28:28.972 --> 02:28:29.652]  I'll go with you.
[02:28:30.412 --> 02:28:30.792]  All right.
[02:28:30.912 --> 02:28:32.052]  Bob's not punching out.
[02:28:32.152 --> 02:28:33.113]  We always love having him.
[02:28:34.853 --> 02:28:37.834]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Arizona.
[02:28:38.234 --> 02:28:38.914]  Tom, go ahead.
[02:28:40.214 --> 02:28:44.255]  Yeah, I was the guy that asked the question about the auctions that are coming up.
[02:28:44.675 --> 02:28:45.795]  So did that answer your question?
[02:28:46.530 --> 02:29:01.737]  Yeah, I just want one thing to ask Bob, is by devaluating, like you just explained, that means they're not going to be able to go to an auction with $300 billion, because if they came out with an auction at $300 billion, that would be catastrophic.
[02:29:01.877 --> 02:29:03.999]  But they've already been buying their own auctions.
[02:29:04.019 --> 02:29:06.020]  How many times did that happen last year, Bob?
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:12.783]  80% of the Treasury auctions were bought indirectly and directly by the Federal Reserve.
[02:29:13.700 --> 02:29:16.221]  Yeah, so see, sir, they're already doing this.
[02:29:18.002 --> 02:29:19.623]  And that's why they want your retirement.
[02:29:20.463 --> 02:29:23.344]  Tom, I appreciate your call, but let me try to explain this for people.
[02:29:24.225 --> 02:29:25.225]  Yeah, because that's old money.
[02:29:25.825 --> 02:29:39.371]  And correct me if I'm wrong here, looking at this, but that's why the Federal Reserve has ordered regional and local banks not to loan and to, in the real world, actually jack up interest rates.
[02:29:39.411 --> 02:29:40.752]  Like, interest rates are at zero.
[02:29:41.152 --> 02:29:43.093]  But there's many credit cards above 30 now.
[02:29:43.113 --> 02:29:45.575]  I mean, this is loan sharking.
[02:29:46.075 --> 02:29:56.342]  They are trying to control inflation by making themselves flush in money to buy big instruments, other banks, companies, military firms, infrastructure.
[02:29:57.182 --> 02:30:11.229]  But freezing and using a true depression in the real economy to try to mask that so it's a bizarre alchemy they're engaged in trying to protect their own structure at the expense of everything else.
[02:30:15.552 --> 02:30:16.492]  Is that accurate, Bob?
[02:30:17.313 --> 02:30:18.053]  It certainly is.
[02:30:19.914 --> 02:30:23.876]  See, the idea of all of those programs like TARP and the rest of them
[02:30:24.631 --> 02:30:29.795]  ...was to make sure that the big banks, brokerage houses, insurance companies stayed in business.
[02:30:31.296 --> 02:30:33.938]  And they used the taxpayers' money to do that.
[02:30:34.899 --> 02:30:38.102]  That doesn't mean that those entities are solvent, because they're not.
[02:30:38.122 --> 02:30:40.023]  Because they're carrying two sets of books.
[02:30:41.845 --> 02:30:43.386]  And so they're not out of the woods.
[02:30:44.375 --> 02:30:50.978]  And they hold, the top 10 banks in New York hold 70% of the deposits of individuals in the United States.
[02:30:51.839 --> 02:30:53.160]  So they're holding us hostage.
[02:30:53.760 --> 02:30:55.161]  They think they can get away with it.
[02:30:55.781 --> 02:31:08.347]  Or, as Dr. Roberts and others have said, they were planning a fleecing, but this black hole is so big, it even endangers their system, and now the really scary thing is they're not in control.
[02:31:08.407 --> 02:31:09.228]  Bob, what do you say to that?
[02:31:11.195 --> 02:31:15.500]  Well, I think they're running fast, and every time you run fast, you make mistakes.
[02:31:16.521 --> 02:31:24.590]  You're cutting corners, and you're backing off, and you're bobbing and weaving, and that leads to unsound thinking.
[02:31:25.371 --> 02:31:31.398]  And so all these dumb things you see happening is because we're pushing them, and we've got to keep on doing it.
[02:31:33.237 --> 02:31:43.742]  What would our situation from your studied view be if for 45 years, almost 50 Bob, with yourself and Red Beckman and G.E.B.
[02:31:43.762 --> 02:31:53.948]  Griffin and many others, and the newer batch of patriots that popped up 15 years ago because of Waco like myself, and then now they even, I mean it's exponential.
[02:31:54.208 --> 02:31:56.149]  You guys were about, you know,
[02:31:57.148 --> 02:31:57.308]  I don't
[02:32:20.555 --> 02:32:22.056]  But no, nothing about how the world works.
[02:32:22.076 --> 02:32:26.520]  There is a rediscovery because it's so dangerous to not be informed now.
[02:32:26.941 --> 02:32:33.346]  Where would we be if you and others 50 years ago hadn't started fighting the New World Order, Bob?
[02:32:34.668 --> 02:32:41.634]  Well, they would have been out of the way and we would have had a totally different society and people would have lived throughout the world.
[02:32:42.766 --> 02:32:48.150]  Uh, much better than they are today because the people at the top wouldn't be around stealing everything.
[02:32:48.490 --> 02:32:50.271]  But that's the reverse of my question.
[02:32:50.291 --> 02:32:51.292]  I'm sorry I wasn't clear.
[02:32:51.952 --> 02:33:07.362]  If you and others, well you've been doing this 48 years, if you hadn't been there fighting them and publishing books that, I don't know, 5 million copies or whatever went out of that Gary Allen book you published, I mean... You call it conspiracy.
[02:33:07.643 --> 02:33:08.283]  Yes.
[02:33:08.763 --> 02:33:09.564]  How many copies of that?
[02:33:10.894 --> 02:33:11.914]  Oh, there were millions of them.
[02:33:12.114 --> 02:33:12.715]  That was in the seven.
[02:33:12.735 --> 02:33:13.575]  I think it was five million.
[02:33:13.615 --> 02:33:15.896]  Yeah, we used to get them printed up for five cents a piece.
[02:33:15.976 --> 02:33:16.796]  It was pretty good.
[02:33:17.416 --> 02:33:17.657]  Yeah.
[02:33:18.237 --> 02:33:24.039]  But I mean, if you hadn't been there with tens of thousands of other patriots, how bad would it be now?
[02:33:25.219 --> 02:33:34.483]  Oh, it'd be dreadful because the people who are learning and have learned, say, since the 1980s, wouldn't have been able to learn because we wouldn't have been there to help them.
[02:33:36.203 --> 02:33:37.204]  And then I wouldn't be here.
[02:33:38.684 --> 02:33:39.305]  Probably not.
[02:33:40.495 --> 02:34:02.959]  I mean, there were congressmen and senators fighting the bankers 100 years ago, 200 years ago in the time of Andrew Jackson, and 235 years ago in the time of George Washington, but from 1900, there was an early wave, then it subsided, I'd say you were part of the second wave, then there was a third wave, I'm part of the third wave, there's a fourth wave, my God, what's the fifth wave gonna be, Bob?
[02:34:04.355 --> 02:34:15.681]  It's going to be all the people that we help to train about the truth and the knowledge that we need to live a life of freedom and a life to its fullest.
[02:34:16.622 --> 02:34:24.526]  And evidently, we've been kind of chosen to do this kind of a job and we like doing it, so we do it.
[02:34:25.026 --> 02:34:31.370]  I mean, who else is 74 years old is running around like a madman like me, with the exception of G. Edward Griffin.
[02:34:32.179 --> 02:34:33.420]  Or Red Beckman, 81.
[02:34:34.061 --> 02:34:36.683]  Or, or, Dr. Stan Monteith.
[02:34:37.203 --> 02:34:38.845]  He's, uh, he's 88.
[02:34:38.945 --> 02:34:39.085]  I'm 78.
[02:34:40.706 --> 02:34:42.147]  None dare call a conspiracy.
[02:34:42.207 --> 02:34:43.468]  Gary Allen with, uh...
[02:34:44.488 --> 02:34:46.369]  Larry Abraham, an incredible book.
[02:34:46.449 --> 02:34:50.490]  This is the book, when I was in high school, that really, really woke me up.
[02:34:51.550 --> 02:34:55.151]  And then I knew the knowledge, so when I went to college, I understood the propaganda.
[02:34:55.811 --> 02:34:56.611]  But think about it.
[02:34:57.271 --> 02:35:00.092]  First wave, 1910, 1920 or so, into the 30s, very small.
[02:35:00.132 --> 02:35:02.853]  Second wave, 1950s, Bob Chapman and other icons of liberty.
[02:35:02.873 --> 02:35:04.073]  Really, the
[02:35:11.152 --> 02:35:21.455]  Blooming of that second wave in the 80s, the huge wave in the mid-90s when I really got active, but I was at the tail end of that new wave, and now this giant fourth wave.
[02:35:21.755 --> 02:35:26.116]  Notice, Bob, the waves are coming faster and faster and getting exponentially bigger.
[02:35:26.396 --> 02:35:32.298]  That's why the globalists are rushing, and in all their white papers, targeting us in many cases by name.
[02:35:32.558 --> 02:35:36.499]  We are literally grappling with the new world order.
[02:35:37.239 --> 02:35:40.180]  Showing the people the power of the individual, Bob.
[02:35:41.775 --> 02:35:45.798]  We sure are, and we're grappling, not with the New World Order, with Satan himself.
[02:35:45.818 --> 02:35:52.203]  You know, we ought to find out who's gotten under a call of conspiracy and buy a bunch of them.
[02:35:53.003 --> 02:35:54.705]  This is an ancient copy right here.
[02:35:55.425 --> 02:35:56.766]  I have about ten copies.
[02:35:59.828 --> 02:36:00.349]  Oh, man.
[02:36:00.389 --> 02:36:02.130]  And I never had Gary sign them.
[02:36:03.940 --> 02:36:12.365]  I've gotten more books by people and read them and critiqued them and all of that, and I never have people bother to sign them for me.
[02:36:13.265 --> 02:36:16.227]  You were involved in the financing of the original publication, correct?
[02:36:16.927 --> 02:36:17.828]  Yes, that's correct.
[02:36:20.249 --> 02:36:23.071]  Now the number I've got on this is 5 million in print.
[02:36:24.812 --> 02:36:26.633]  Yeah, but there was more than that.
[02:36:26.653 --> 02:36:29.554]  I think they did one more printing after that.
[02:36:30.435 --> 02:36:32.616]  And then we had a warehouse full of them.
[02:36:33.622 --> 02:36:44.585]  And so we would sell them in batches and you know a box would go out for postage and five bucks just to spread them out.
[02:36:44.685 --> 02:36:46.246]  You know we were pamphleteers.
[02:36:46.966 --> 02:36:48.267]  We couldn't get on the radio.
[02:36:48.367 --> 02:36:52.948]  I think the first one that was successful getting on the radio was Alan Stang.
[02:36:53.783 --> 02:36:59.365]  He was on a station in Glendale, California, and I used to go on with him once in a while, but that was in the early 80s.
[02:36:59.565 --> 02:37:01.485]  That was 20 years after we started.
[02:37:01.906 --> 02:37:03.286]  And Sting died last year.
[02:37:03.306 --> 02:37:04.947]  Eusis Mullins died Tuesday.
[02:37:05.727 --> 02:37:08.848]  I tell you, you and... Eusis was a very good friend of mine as well.
[02:37:10.808 --> 02:37:18.471]  In fact, I put Renzi's obit into this issue for tomorrow, and I put a little piece in myself.
[02:37:20.017 --> 02:37:23.520]  In fact, give me a document cam shot for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:25.461]  Radio listeners, I guess, can't see this.
[02:37:26.141 --> 02:37:30.364]  It says, you can buy books yourself at quantity price and distribute them as described in Chapter 8.
[02:37:31.465 --> 02:37:32.046]  One copy, $1.
[02:37:32.966 --> 02:37:34.127]  Three copies, $2.
[02:37:34.207 --> 02:37:35.388]  Ten copies, $5.
[02:37:35.428 --> 02:37:38.550]  You guys were selling them at cost because your heart was in the right place.
[02:37:38.570 --> 02:37:39.491]  That's why it had such effect.
[02:37:39.851 --> 02:37:40.712]  Twenty-five copies, $10.
[02:37:40.772 --> 02:37:41.993]  Ten copies, 100 copies, $30.
[02:37:42.473 --> 02:37:42.994]  Ten cartons, $250.
[02:37:49.438 --> 02:37:55.805]  So, all of this is going on, a thousand copies for 250 bucks, selling these Operation Counter-Attack.
[02:37:55.845 --> 02:37:56.326]  Look at this.
[02:37:56.746 --> 02:38:10.621]  Now, I remember reading this book, and I believe this is even the copy I had back in the early 90s, or I guess in the late 80s, and I remember reading this book and then years later making my first film in 97 and saying, it's free,
[02:38:11.582 --> 02:38:15.305]  Basically, like none dare call a conspiracy, make copies of it.
[02:38:15.665 --> 02:38:17.806]  And again, that's why listeners need to understand.
[02:38:18.527 --> 02:38:27.633]  Now is the time to be getting Obama Deception, Follow the Republic, and Endgame, and Truth Rising, and the other films and books we produced and sell.
[02:38:27.973 --> 02:38:32.797]  Now is the time to be making copies of my films, because we're into the fourth wave now.
[02:38:33.197 --> 02:38:36.198]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the ultimate time of awakening.
[02:38:36.458 --> 02:38:44.920]  I mean, you talk about clawing and scratching and battling down in the literal trenches like Bob and others did 30, 40, 50 years ago.
[02:38:45.300 --> 02:38:51.481]  Now, the people are ready to hear us and we're standing on the shoulders of people like Bob.
[02:38:51.521 --> 02:38:54.102]  I mean, Bob, how important is it to fight back now?
[02:38:56.053 --> 02:39:01.498]  It's for your whole life and the lives of all the people you're a progeny that comes behind you.
[02:39:02.018 --> 02:39:08.863]  Because if you don't beat these people, your children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc., are going to live on their knees.
[02:39:08.883 --> 02:39:10.485]  They're going to be enslaved.
[02:39:10.865 --> 02:39:14.048]  These people are evil, and you've got to stop them.
[02:39:16.069 --> 02:39:17.510]  You know, that's the amazing thing, Bob.
[02:39:17.530 --> 02:39:18.651]  I know you've had a lot of threats.
[02:39:18.691 --> 02:39:21.193]  They've tried to set you up, even drove you out of the country.
[02:39:22.162 --> 02:39:30.948]  For exposing them, and when I get persecuted, it just lets me know how real this is, and how important it is, and then I don't even care about myself.
[02:39:31.128 --> 02:39:32.229]  It's not even my children.
[02:39:32.549 --> 02:39:34.691]  I realize how fast our generation's come and go.
[02:39:35.051 --> 02:39:51.142]  I'm envisioning my children's great-grandchildren, and that I want them to be free, and I'll do anything to stop them from being slaves, and people are caught up in American Idol, football, things that don't matter, folks, when our entire
[02:39:52.270 --> 02:39:57.876]  Humanity, who we are, is literally being destroyed right now by a scientific tyranny.
[02:39:58.217 --> 02:39:59.698]  We can't give the world up.
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:02.321]  To a bunch of vicious control freaks.
[02:40:02.881 --> 02:40:22.915]  And I see all these, all these hollow people who have money, who have power, and they're so unhappy because they've never tuned in to what it really is to be human and realize that we're all just part of the species and the measure of who we are and the value of who we are is how we empower humanity.
[02:40:23.595 --> 02:40:27.698]  And then once you reach this point, you're not worried about being killed or tortured.
[02:40:27.978 --> 02:40:29.839]  You're only worried about beating the enemy.
[02:40:29.879 --> 02:40:30.420]  Bob Chapman.
[02:40:31.541 --> 02:40:32.601]  I agree completely.
[02:40:32.621 --> 02:40:36.944]  And of course, being older, and you know, you're young enough to be my son.
[02:40:37.044 --> 02:40:39.225]  In fact, my son's 41 years old.
[02:40:40.165 --> 02:40:43.167]  And your fear leaves.
[02:40:43.908 --> 02:40:45.188]  There is no fear anymore.
[02:40:45.789 --> 02:40:49.691]  Because you know that your body and your mind eventually are going to break down.
[02:40:49.751 --> 02:40:53.573]  It's the causation of existence as a human being.
[02:40:54.234 --> 02:40:56.535]  And so you become freer and freer and freer.
[02:40:57.328 --> 02:40:59.129]  And, you know, you walk on air.
[02:40:59.189 --> 02:41:00.189]  They can't touch you.
[02:41:00.209 --> 02:41:01.289]  There's nothing they can do.
[02:41:02.070 --> 02:41:12.573]  And that's the time that all of you people out there who are in 60s and 70s and 80s should get together and do something positive and help.
[02:41:13.134 --> 02:41:18.795]  Because there's so many people sitting around doing nothing when they could be doing something.
[02:41:19.876 --> 02:41:25.918]  And if you sit around doing nothing, you're going to atrophy physically and mentally.
[02:41:26.787 --> 02:41:28.028]  So let's help out.
[02:41:28.549 --> 02:41:29.730]  Don't turn your back on it.
[02:41:30.170 --> 02:41:32.332]  Don't be mad because you're going to die.
[02:41:33.793 --> 02:41:34.774]  Everybody has to.
[02:41:35.675 --> 02:41:38.477]  There's no way out of this world except that way.
[02:41:39.458 --> 02:41:40.379]  And so get with it.
[02:41:41.721 --> 02:42:08.470]  Yeah, the world sells us a certain selfishness that being involved or standing up or fighting is somehow weak, and that just caring about yourself and greedily hiding with a bunch of crap and a bunch of baubles is success, when the whole point of humanity is helping your tribe, helping your people, helping build something for the future, because I'm going to die, but my progeny are going to go on forever unless I let these people win!
[02:42:10.271 --> 02:42:18.838]  It's just, if people could grasp, Bob, what you and I grasp, and this unchanging, total truth, we would free ourselves overnight.
[02:42:19.679 --> 02:42:25.844]  And to see the whole world in the grip of the beast, it's just such an illusion.
[02:42:25.904 --> 02:42:27.105]  It's such a trance.
[02:42:27.225 --> 02:42:28.186]  It's a hoax.
[02:42:28.646 --> 02:42:29.327]  It's a fraud.
[02:42:29.367 --> 02:42:30.027]  It's a lie.
[02:42:30.568 --> 02:42:33.730]  TheInternationalForecaster.com, I think this is one of our best interviews ever.
[02:42:34.131 --> 02:42:36.813]  Bob, have a great weekend, and God bless you, my friend.
[02:42:36.833 --> 02:42:37.694]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:42:38.655 --> 02:42:40.977]  Thank you very much and thank you all for listening.
[02:42:42.178 --> 02:42:44.580]  We'll come back in the final segment with some final thoughts.
[02:42:46.681 --> 02:42:51.285]  Folks, you're not a human being until you stand up against tyranny.
[02:42:51.846 --> 02:42:53.387]  You were born to fight corruption.
[02:42:53.747 --> 02:42:55.589]  You were born to stand against the king.
[02:42:57.389 --> 02:43:00.411]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:43:00.771 --> 02:43:04.373]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:43:04.673 --> 02:43:08.135]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:43:08.395 --> 02:43:15.879]  At less than two cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[02:43:15.879 --> 02:43:16.239]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:43:16.259 --> 02:43:16.479]  I think so.
[02:43:16.500 --> 02:43:16.840]  I think so.
[02:43:41.540 --> 02:43:43.501]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:43:43.521 --> 02:43:45.561]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:43:45.581 --> 02:43:47.242]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:44:07.888 --> 02:44:10.449]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:44:10.469 --> 02:44:16.691]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:44:16.851 --> 02:44:21.893]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:44:22.033 --> 02:44:32.016]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:44:32.156 --> 02:44:34.257]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:44:34.497 --> 02:44:35.837]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:44:36.097 --> 02:44:38.358]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:44:38.538 --> 02:44:40.378]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:44:40.658 --> 02:44:45.459]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:44:45.819 --> 02:44:50.581]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:44:50.821 --> 02:44:54.922]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:44:56.829 --> 02:45:00.012]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:45:00.372 --> 02:45:02.214]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:45:02.674 --> 02:45:03.094]  Don't!
[02:45:03.535 --> 02:45:06.557]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:45:06.978 --> 02:45:15.745]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[02:45:16.066 --> 02:45:19.729]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:45:20.129 --> 02:45:22.852]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:45:23.272 --> 02:45:30.300]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:31.641]  Herb K was right.
[02:45:31.842 --> 02:45:34.905]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:45:35.005 --> 02:45:36.026]  What have you got to lose?
[02:45:36.366 --> 02:45:39.510]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[02:45:40.070 --> 02:45:43.735]  Get Herb K's number one death secret absolutely free now!
[02:45:44.015 --> 02:45:44.556]  Call 888-352-7726.
[02:45:44.596 --> 02:45:44.856]  That's 888-352-7726.
[02:45:44.876 --> 02:45:44.916]  888-352-7726.
[02:46:15.646 --> 02:46:16.426]  Deadlines.
[02:46:16.446 --> 02:46:17.266]  I think about it.
[02:46:34.431 --> 02:46:40.575]  The beautiful night sky, the distant stars, millions and millions and trillions of miles away.
[02:46:41.495 --> 02:46:47.959]  I think about all the beauty, all the richness of consciousness and life and experience.
[02:46:49.300 --> 02:47:00.047]  It is the job of good, virtuous men and women who love innocence and beauty and honor.
[02:47:01.823 --> 02:47:06.384]  To spend our time, to sacrifice our energies against tyranny.
[02:47:08.085 --> 02:47:09.625]  Does that mean any of us are perfect?
[02:47:09.705 --> 02:47:09.925]  No.
[02:47:09.985 --> 02:47:11.346]  The world will come back at you.
[02:47:11.806 --> 02:47:17.247]  The old serpent will come at you and tell you you're not good, you're bad, and point out to you the things you've done that are wrong.
[02:47:17.287 --> 02:47:17.968]  That doesn't matter.
[02:47:18.488 --> 02:47:19.848]  What matters is your heart.
[02:47:20.088 --> 02:47:24.369]  Like God said to King David, your heart was right.
[02:47:25.050 --> 02:47:27.850]  Didn't matter even some of the mistakes and bad things he did.
[02:47:28.311 --> 02:47:29.751]  At the end of the day, he was a good man.
[02:47:32.905 --> 02:47:40.748]  And to the listeners out there, I have become the main symbol worldwide of resistance to the New World Order.
[02:47:42.288 --> 02:47:45.469]  The only other person who could rival what we've done here is Ron Paul.
[02:47:47.030 --> 02:47:49.671]  And he is a great statesman and a good man, but he's old.
[02:47:51.471 --> 02:47:59.074]  And I have searched the world for bona fide patriots, people who are real, people who I've watched for a long time.
[02:47:59.934 --> 02:48:01.735]  And I find them with the common people.
[02:48:02.651 --> 02:48:04.133]  I don't find them with the elitist.
[02:48:04.193 --> 02:48:05.494]  I don't find them with the globalist.
[02:48:05.534 --> 02:48:12.122]  I don't find them even in much of the people that you would see as leadership against the fight against the New World Order.
[02:48:13.563 --> 02:48:16.066]  And many times I say I'm not cut out for this job.
[02:48:17.067 --> 02:48:18.509]  The responsibility is too great.
[02:48:19.350 --> 02:48:22.994]  The power I've been given is humbling.
[02:48:27.321 --> 02:48:31.525]  Yesterday, I pulled into a Mexican food restaurant to eat quickly.
[02:48:31.885 --> 02:48:33.847]  I had to come back to work and work till late in the evening.
[02:48:35.288 --> 02:48:36.949]  And the people at the door were listeners.
[02:48:38.551 --> 02:48:40.232]  As I walked by the bar, they were listeners.
[02:48:41.533 --> 02:48:42.794]  A woman came over from a table.
[02:48:42.914 --> 02:48:43.915]  A family came over.
[02:48:44.536 --> 02:48:55.525]  People from New Zealand, who were there, stopped and took photos with me and said, New Zealand is on fire with you, Alex Jones.
[02:49:01.625 --> 02:49:03.126]  I have a great responsibility.
[02:49:07.487 --> 02:49:13.750]  And it is because my heart is true, and I'm real, and I work hard, that we've had this much success.
[02:49:15.411 --> 02:49:16.951]  And we go into very dark waters.
[02:49:18.472 --> 02:49:21.193]  The enemy is moving against us on every front.
[02:49:22.853 --> 02:49:26.355]  But they don't want to yet smash me, because that will make me a martyr.
[02:49:27.867 --> 02:49:35.993]  And I pledge this to you, I will do the best job I can, possibly, in this weak body and this flesh, to be a pure, good person.
[02:49:36.554 --> 02:49:39.496]  But at the end of the day, that doesn't even matter.
[02:49:40.177 --> 02:49:46.061]  Because no doubt, I will fail as many times as I succeed.
[02:49:47.322 --> 02:49:54.868]  And I am just as worldly as the next person, but I want to be good, and I want to defeat the tyranny.
[02:49:55.609 --> 02:49:56.249]  But through you,
[02:49:57.833 --> 02:49:59.874]  We will defeat the New World Order with God's help.
[02:50:00.354 --> 02:50:01.014]  Remember that.
[02:50:01.194 --> 02:50:10.217]  It is the idea of freedom, the idea of liberty, the idea of honor and everything that is good and pure that will trump the lie.
[02:50:11.217 --> 02:50:16.638]  And so remember the important mission you're on and just how serious the times are that we're in.
[02:50:17.038 --> 02:50:20.519]  The destiny of humanity is being decided right now.
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:25.721]  For many generations in the future, our progeny will look back on this time
[02:50:27.870 --> 02:50:33.212]  As a place where humanity stood up against tyranny, or as a time when we fell to total darkness.
[02:50:33.813 --> 02:50:34.553]  God bless you all.
[02:50:34.593 --> 02:50:35.393]  Great job, crew.
[02:50:35.633 --> 02:50:36.514]  Transmission starts now.
[02:50:39.455 --> 02:50:40.576]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
