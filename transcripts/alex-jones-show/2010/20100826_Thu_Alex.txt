[00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:08.727]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.368 --> 00:00:10.169]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.871]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:16.177]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.698 --> 00:00:20.763]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.223 --> 00:00:28.866]  It is Thursday, the 26th day of August, 2010.
[00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:34.429]  We have a jam-packed transmission for you today.
[00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.874]  Decorated war veteran and FBI agent who's retired, Don Adams, will be joining us in T-minus 30 minutes.
[00:00:41.894 --> 00:00:44.516]  Appreciate the producers and crew getting him so quickly.
[00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:49.900]  Of course, two days ago, he did a detailed TV interview breaking down conclusive proof
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:00.803]  Even mainstream news had to say, conclusive proof of a government cover-up of the real hit team that murdered John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, 40-plus years ago.
[00:01:01.323 --> 00:01:08.645]  Then an amazing activist and filmmaker of United We Fall, Dan Dix, will be joining us, coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:13.607]  And then in the third hour, Manny Bedillo and Bob McIlvain.
[00:01:13.627 --> 00:01:18.108]  Of course, Bob lost his son in the World Trade Center attacks of almost nine years ago.
[00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:19.589]  They've gotten some
[00:01:21.363 --> 00:01:21.944]  I don't know.
[00:01:41.784 --> 00:01:45.706]  Manny Bedillo and Bob McElveen contacted me to want to premiere this today.
[00:01:46.167 --> 00:01:52.690]  It starts airing in different markets around the country this weekend, and they'll be spending about 40 minutes with us in the third hour.
[00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:57.533]  Dan Dix will be on with us about 40 minutes as well via video link from Canada.
[00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:04.277]  In the balance of those hours, I'll be blitzing through news, because there is a lot of it.
[00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:10.501]  So we've got four guests coming up today, all extremely informative on our quest
[00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:15.903]  To awaken and inform the population about the true nature of our planet today.
[00:02:16.763 --> 00:02:18.964]  Obviously, huge developments on the economy.
[00:02:18.984 --> 00:02:20.745]  We're going to be going over that.
[00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:32.449]  Finland is the latest nation to suspend the swine flu shot completely, saying it's linked to Guillain-Barre, to narcolepsy, where you basically just pass out.
[00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.973]  And then wake up when you're driving a car, when you're sitting in a restaurant, when you're watching television.
[00:02:39.714 --> 00:02:41.695]  Literally hundreds of different neurological disorders.
[00:02:41.715 --> 00:02:43.957]  It just fries the brain, does different things, different people.
[00:02:44.437 --> 00:02:50.342]  England, of course, a month ago suspended the flu shots for five and unders because of a tenfold, the government admits,
[00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:52.463]  Increase in convulsions.
[00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:55.346]  I mean, it's so obvious they're having to even back off.
[00:02:55.646 --> 00:03:12.100]  More news now coming out three-plus years into the carnage of the deaths and illnesses caused by Gardasil that supposedly blocks the transmission of the human papillomavirus that is linked to about 3,000 cancer deaths a year, which is substantial but in the aggregate very small.
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:23.828]  And clearly there's a lot more health problems associated in the cost-benefit analysis with this attenuated virus injection with the cervical cancer than what it supposedly treats.
[00:03:24.088 --> 00:03:26.629]  And on the insert of the drug it says it doesn't even protect you from it.
[00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:40.139]  So we'll be breaking down the latest developments there ahead of, well it's already here, but the intensified, ahead of the intensified push for another hoax where they say you must take the H1N1 shot mixed with the seasonal
[00:03:41.172 --> 00:03:42.953]  Blue shot this year.
[00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:49.436]  Also, we're going to get into the incredible developments in Mexico.
[00:03:50.156 --> 00:03:52.617]  I'm going to cover this first when we come back from break.
[00:03:53.077 --> 00:03:59.240]  You know about the 72 butchered bodies found near the Texas border, murdered by the coyotes.
[00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.682]  And this, quite frankly, is nothing.
[00:04:04.623 --> 00:04:05.685]  I mean, I live in Texas.
[00:04:05.705 --> 00:04:07.506]  There's been a cover-up of this for decades.
[00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:10.830]  I remember reading Texas Monthly.
[00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:14.353]  It's got to be 20-plus years ago.
[00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:23.633]  About repeated times they dig up hundreds of bodies of men, women, and children who've been tortured to death many times.
[00:04:24.613 --> 00:04:32.014]  And by cover up, it's been in the Texas News, Dallas Morning News, Texas Monthly done a good job, San Antonio Express News, but I see these every month or so.
[00:04:33.414 --> 00:04:37.455]  There's satanic cults that murder hundreds of people.
[00:04:39.055 --> 00:04:42.476]  It's like Dust Till Dawn or something, but it's not vampires, it's humans.
[00:04:44.898 --> 00:04:45.499]  It's insane.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.567]  And it shows how Mexico is one of the most wicked vortexes of evil on the planet.
[00:04:51.627 --> 00:04:53.089]  It makes Zimbabwe look good.
[00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.694]  And, well, we're going to cover it when we come back, and a lot more.
[00:04:56.714 --> 00:04:57.135]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.511]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:04.851 --> 00:05:08.755]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:11.017]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:11.177 --> 00:05:16.482]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:23.108]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:23.528 --> 00:05:29.071]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:29.511 --> 00:05:33.193]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:05:33.693 --> 00:05:37.695]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:37.996 --> 00:05:43.919]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:46.880]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:48.921]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:49.462 --> 00:05:49.882]  It's here.

[00:06:01.104 --> 00:06:04.727]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:05.067 --> 00:06:13.193]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:06:13.934 --> 00:06:17.977]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:06:18.557 --> 00:06:29.386]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:39.011]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:39.512 --> 00:06:44.555]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:06:44.955 --> 00:06:52.119]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.841]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:06:59.068 --> 00:07:03.070]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning TrendsResearch.com.

[00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:57.866]  This information is too important to wait.
[00:08:04.827 --> 00:08:10.380]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:10.861 --> 00:08:13.407]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:08:18.001 --> 00:08:18.522]  We're live!
[00:08:18.562 --> 00:08:20.504]  It's Thursday, 26th day of August, 2010.
[00:08:20.585 --> 00:08:30.418]  We've got a retired FBI agent with first-hand intel on the cover-up of the assassination of John F. Kennedy coming up in about 25 minutes.
[00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:35.084]  And some other extremely informative guests as well, I'll tell you about later in the hour.
[00:08:37.608 --> 00:08:43.230]  The United Nations for two years has been investigating Texas and Arizona saying that we should have completely open borders.
[00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:51.933]  But they don't investigate Mexico that imprisons, extorts, and murders immigrants from Central and South America.
[00:08:52.313 --> 00:08:56.575]  Now Obama has hauled Arizona before the UN Human Rights Council.
[00:08:57.275 --> 00:08:58.795]  So this is more high treason.
[00:08:58.815 --> 00:09:01.576]  Of course, Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S.
[00:09:01.636 --> 00:09:05.198]  president, and no president ever chaired the UN Security Council.
[00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:12.077]  Former President, and this is just intensifying the treason and violates the 11th Amendment.
[00:09:12.738 --> 00:09:22.949]  You cannot sue on behalf of a foreign power or individual or corporation a state or citizen of a state or a citizen of the United States.
[00:09:23.349 --> 00:09:27.874]  The federal government cannot do that under the Bill of Rights, the 11th Amendment.
[00:09:29.261 --> 00:09:39.825]  So we're going to be discussing that and just the huge mass graves and extermination centers they're finding all over Mexico where they're murdering the mainly non-Mexican immigrants.
[00:09:40.245 --> 00:09:42.626]  There's an extreme hatred that
[00:09:43.988 --> 00:09:48.410]  The Mexican government and the culture has for anybody outside Mexico.
[00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.932]  In fact, there's more extreme hatred of Guatemala than there is even for the U.S.
[00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:54.592]  because Mexico lost a war with them.
[00:09:54.873 --> 00:09:56.353]  That was Mexico as well.
[00:09:57.133 --> 00:10:01.315]  And it's just, if they don't have money, women, children, they torture them to death, they kill them.
[00:10:01.735 --> 00:10:02.936]  And that's now mainstream news.
[00:10:02.976 --> 00:10:05.077]  I'm always telling you about this because I live in Texas.
[00:10:05.717 --> 00:10:13.261]  From the time I was a little child, I would see my parents reading the Dallas Morning News where they dug up 18 more bodies, they'd all been sacrificed.
[00:10:13.841 --> 00:10:16.422]  The children had had their hearts cut out after being raped.
[00:10:16.883 --> 00:10:19.264]  Remember the article earlier this week about the mayor?
[00:10:20.677 --> 00:10:30.685]  Down in a Mexican city that had never really had any crime problems, and his own police came to his house, took him and killed him, and dumped him on the road, and the media said he was lucky they didn't rape him and cut his head off.
[00:10:31.105 --> 00:10:34.948]  Well, the raping is part of the Satanism, and I have mainstream news on that.
[00:10:34.988 --> 00:10:37.671]  I mean, if you want an actual satanic kingdom,
[00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:44.774]  Where now the most popular made-up saints are the skinny one, and it's just pure devil worship running rampant.
[00:10:45.094 --> 00:10:46.475]  You cannot make this up!
[00:10:46.996 --> 00:10:49.237]  You cannot make this up!
[00:10:49.317 --> 00:10:57.303]  And now the Southwest is becoming this, and the killing of police is beginning, and the police will probably bow down to it out of fear, and it's over.
[00:10:57.803 --> 00:10:58.183]  It's over.
[00:10:58.523 --> 00:11:02.406]  You'll be kidnapped, you'll be sacrificed, your children will, and nothing will be done.
[00:11:02.846 --> 00:11:08.030]  You cannot stop the pure evil in Mexico unless you shut the border down.
[00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.750]  You cannot stop it.
[00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.891]  It is probably the most evil country on earth.
[00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:13.831]  That's what I keep explaining to people.
[00:11:14.691 --> 00:11:15.071]  Okay?
[00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:19.892]  And it's a cultural fact that it is descending into Hades itself.
[00:11:20.932 --> 00:11:33.435]  You've got hard-working, good Christian people down there, but they're being completely just supplanted by some of the older, more devilish things that went on in the culture pre-colonial times.
[00:11:34.415 --> 00:11:34.555]  Now,
[00:11:35.745 --> 00:11:44.952]  I'm going to put this plug in here briefly, because I've decided that I'm just going to do everything I can to get as many DVDs out to people, and I'm running specials for two weeks.
[00:11:45.672 --> 00:11:50.656]  We had one special where you could buy one copy of The Obama Deception, get three free, buy two, get eight free.
[00:11:51.036 --> 00:11:52.677]  That elapsed in about two and a half weeks.
[00:11:53.058 --> 00:11:59.922]  We had another special where you could get our three latest films, Fall of the Republic, Invisible Empire, Police State 4, buy one, get three free.
[00:12:00.683 --> 00:12:02.825]  Well, this is the mother of all specials.
[00:12:02.845 --> 00:12:09.571]  We've never had anything close to this, and it's been up since yesterday, and it's already the hottest promo we've ever had.
[00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:10.492]  But I know why.
[00:12:11.325 --> 00:12:14.827]  We literally make no money on this.
[00:12:15.227 --> 00:12:16.868]  Less than two dollars a piece.
[00:12:17.309 --> 00:12:19.710]  And some of our most informative and hottest titles.
[00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:28.395]  You can get Terror Storm, How Weed Won the West About the Phony Drug War, Fabled Enemies, Reflections and Warnings with Aaron Russo, and American Dictators.
[00:12:28.775 --> 00:12:30.416]  Five films for $9.95.
[00:12:31.877 --> 00:12:33.038]  Five films.
[00:12:33.418 --> 00:12:34.519]  We're running this for two weeks.
[00:12:34.979 --> 00:12:38.201]  Five films, $9.95, less than $2 a piece.
[00:12:38.701 --> 00:12:43.544]  Five of some of our most important documentaries with the shrink wrap, the color cover.
[00:12:43.844 --> 00:12:48.266]  These are great to give people and wake them up and to inform yourself to a higher level.
[00:12:48.546 --> 00:12:50.347]  They're available at InfoWars.com.
[00:12:53.021 --> 00:12:53.962]  you can also
[00:13:11.954 --> 00:13:14.537]  They're making more at their factory right now.
[00:13:14.797 --> 00:13:16.719]  We're going to sell out of these very, very quickly.
[00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:18.080]  United We Fall.
[00:13:18.521 --> 00:13:20.683]  Three nations, two sides, one union.
[00:13:20.703 --> 00:13:23.185]  A Bryan Law film.
[00:13:24.106 --> 00:13:29.191]  And of course, also made with Dan Dix, who's going to be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:13:30.052 --> 00:13:31.893]  And they interviewed everybody in this.
[00:13:31.933 --> 00:13:34.175]  They got interviews with CFR people.
[00:13:34.215 --> 00:13:36.036]  They got interviews with top globalists.
[00:13:36.356 --> 00:13:42.960]  They got interviews with Robert Pasteur, the head globalist who wrote the North American Union Agreement.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:48.763]  This is such a well-produced, informative film about the North American Union and the tyranny.
[00:13:49.143 --> 00:13:49.904]  United We Fall.
[00:13:50.144 --> 00:13:50.924]  You buy one copy, $19.95.
[00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:53.266]  Get a second copy.
[00:13:53.506 --> 00:13:56.208]  When you buy a second copy, you get three films free.
[00:13:56.508 --> 00:13:59.451]  American Dictators, Fabled Enemies, and How Weed Won the West.
[00:13:59.731 --> 00:14:04.594]  And that may not even be for a week, because when these sell out, we'll have to pull it until we get more in.
[00:14:04.975 --> 00:14:06.636]  So, Infowars.com.
[00:14:06.736 --> 00:14:10.419]  You can also download all of my films in super high quality.

[00:14:17.624 --> 00:14:36.799]  Don't tread on me rise the Republic can't FEMA and so many other special exclusive reports at prison planet dot TV Okay, I Want to now I want to now get into the situation with Mexico I
[00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:51.005]  Mexico has been surveyed and estimated by major banks and brokerage firms to have at least three times the natural resources of the United States.
[00:14:52.206 --> 00:14:54.969]  Of the lower 48 in Hawaii and Alaska combined.
[00:14:55.530 --> 00:15:01.296]  Oil, gold, timber, rich volcanic soil, every other mineral you can imagine.
[00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:06.341]  It's got hard-working, good people that live there.
[00:15:06.401 --> 00:15:08.322]  But something changed in Mexico.
[00:15:08.782 --> 00:15:20.408]  Something allowed it to go from just an oppressed people controlled by a powerful elite that had merged with the major New York banks by the 1970s on record.
[00:15:20.948 --> 00:15:22.209]  A vassal of the globalists.
[00:15:24.275 --> 00:15:41.532]  Under United Nations treaties and biospheres, they forced much of the indigenous Mayan population and other tribes off of their lands all over Mexico and forced them to Mexico City as a staging ground to the United States.
[00:15:41.572 --> 00:15:42.293]  This is on record.
[00:15:42.853 --> 00:15:45.377]  And the Ford Foundation, Carnegie Endowment, funded this.
[00:15:45.437 --> 00:15:53.970]  They're on record 60 years ago funding liberation theology, going into Mexico, paying for the textbooks with the average 6th grade education.
[00:15:55.046 --> 00:16:03.688]  That the United States must be brought down, that it belongs to Mexico, and that Mexico is in the plight it is, not because of the globalists, but because of the American people.
[00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:15.671]  So it took the existing nationalism, and that Mexico had lost wars and conflicts with us, that was just a kernel of anger and distrust, and there had been some discrimination against Hispanics from Mexico, you know, in the history of this country as well.
[00:16:17.527 --> 00:16:19.668]  Especially after Mexico attacked the United States again.
[00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:23.251]  Actually, over a third of those that founded Texas were Hispanic, the father of the Constitution.
[00:16:23.572 --> 00:16:27.855]  But then race relations degenerated after that, mainly just over fighting over land.
[00:16:28.235 --> 00:16:31.078]  I mean, white people were killing white people for land as well.
[00:16:32.018 --> 00:16:33.940]  I mean, it was wild.
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.822]  But they particularly ganged up and picked on Hispanics.
[00:16:37.343 --> 00:16:38.424]  So that went on.
[00:16:39.024 --> 00:16:43.047]  And so all of this anger got generated, and the Ford Foundation and others, 60-plus years ago,
[00:16:43.968 --> 00:16:46.210]  About the 1940s, so it's almost 70 years ago.
[00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:47.572]  Man, time flies.
[00:16:48.493 --> 00:16:56.281]  And they went in there and did this, and then in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, and I've been in Yucatan.
[00:16:56.621 --> 00:17:00.706]  I've been in other areas of Mexico with the big signs, UN Biosphere Land for Sale.
[00:17:01.841 --> 00:17:05.064]  And they stole the people's property that they've been on for thousands of years.
[00:17:05.104 --> 00:17:06.246]  They didn't have deeds for it.
[00:17:06.666 --> 00:17:09.048]  They pushed them off their corn farms.
[00:17:09.969 --> 00:17:11.871]  And they, you know, happy, good people.
[00:17:12.372 --> 00:17:16.616]  And they sent them up to Mexico City, now 30 plus million people living in hell.
[00:17:16.996 --> 00:17:20.260]  They have what they call brown snow every day.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.964]  Which is feces raining down that dries and is blown up into the air.
[00:17:24.264 --> 00:17:27.287]  More than half the population lives in cardboard boxes.
[00:17:28.068 --> 00:17:32.954]  More than a third of the children are born in Mexico City with a disorder where they have a shriveled tiny brain.
[00:17:33.014 --> 00:17:33.995]  It's only a brain stem.
[00:17:34.195 --> 00:17:36.518]  They're just born as totally brain dead zombies.
[00:17:37.539 --> 00:17:39.000]  And it is, it is hell!
[00:17:39.881 --> 00:17:40.581]  It is hell.
[00:17:41.302 --> 00:17:42.682]  Literal, globalist hell.
[00:17:43.302 --> 00:17:45.423]  And they create the crisis and offer the solution.
[00:17:45.543 --> 00:17:54.326]  Then, as we told you with former DEA agents and others that we had on the show, like Stella Costello six years ago, Los Zetas was trained by the CIA
[00:17:55.706 --> 00:18:06.694]  And give an anti-drug war funding to consolidate the drug cartel and to kick out the Central and South American and other Mexican drug cartels that weren't controlled by major US banks.
[00:18:07.254 --> 00:18:10.736]  Grasso, the head of the New York Stock Exchange in 99, was in Reuters.
[00:18:10.997 --> 00:18:11.637]  Photos of him.
[00:18:11.897 --> 00:18:16.640]  He went and told the head of the FARC in Colombia, you will invest your drug money with us?
[00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:18.861]  That's actually legal under U.S.
[00:18:18.921 --> 00:18:19.202]  law.
[00:18:19.502 --> 00:18:23.263]  If it's from outside the country, because they write the laws, or we will attack you.
[00:18:23.343 --> 00:18:25.703]  He said no, they attacked and assassinated him.
[00:18:26.123 --> 00:18:29.184]  So it's a massive drug war consolidation operation.
[00:18:29.464 --> 00:18:33.065]  Much of the Afghan war is about that, and they now admit our troops were forced to grow the opium.
[00:18:34.206 --> 00:18:38.667]  So you've got tens of millions of displaced people.
[00:18:39.932 --> 00:18:46.997]  Mexico's population has gone from 60 million a few decades ago to 100 million in Mexico, set to go to 150 million by 2022.
[00:18:47.618 --> 00:18:49.840]  You can pull those numbers up.
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:56.705]  There's 30-plus million Mexicans that see themselves as Mexicans from Mexico and were taught by the Ford Foundation to hate America.
[00:18:57.125 --> 00:18:57.926]  They don't even know that.
[00:18:57.946 --> 00:18:59.207]  They don't know who funded them.
[00:18:59.747 --> 00:19:00.708]  to come into the U.S.
[00:19:00.728 --> 00:19:24.403]  be a voting bloc, but also drive down wages, break down society, and cause total collapse, so the globalists can come in and reorganize us in the name of security into the North American Union, as the CFR Robert Pasteur battle plan shows, and as the declassified, or it's actually, they sued to get it, 2006 BAMF Canada North American Union Security Prosperity Partnership document show.
[00:19:25.584 --> 00:19:25.744]  So,
[00:19:27.554 --> 00:19:44.746]  They say they're going to use Mexico collapsing, all engineered, to fall into the United States, then their answer will be, just like when the banks bankrupt things, give them more power, give the private banks the power to set up this new North American Union in the name of security, with standardized military training and security operations.
[00:19:45.747 --> 00:19:46.488]  When we come back,
[00:19:47.915 --> 00:19:49.795]  I'm gonna break down what's happened in Mexico.
[00:19:49.875 --> 00:19:55.617]  It is a 100% failed state, descending into hell, the likes of which the planet has never seen.
[00:19:55.917 --> 00:19:59.478]  We'll be back, and tell you about all the mass graves and mass killing, straight ahead.
[00:20:00.078 --> 00:20:01.238]  Attention to all U.S.
[00:20:01.318 --> 00:20:08.920]  drivers who own a vehicle that has less than 130,000 miles, with an auto warranty about to expire, or no warranty coverage at all.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:15.341]  Due to our country's economic crisis, and auto repair costs on the rise, if your vehicle has less than 130,000 miles, as of today,
[00:20:17.662 --> 00:20:27.569]  You could be one of the millions of drivers that now may qualify to have your vehicle covered under United Repair Plans and have 100% of your future covered auto repair bills paid for you.
[00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:32.633]  This low-cost vehicle service contract has been established under United Repair Plans.
[00:20:32.853 --> 00:20:39.515]  And is now available to the general public in order to save drivers thousands of dollars on auto repairs during our country's recession.
[00:20:39.915 --> 00:20:48.258]  If you own a vehicle with less than 130,000 miles, you may now call to see if your vehicle qualifies and for a free 5-minute quote.
[00:20:48.618 --> 00:20:49.538]  Number to call is 800-809-4491.
[00:20:49.558 --> 00:20:49.598]  800-809-4491.
[00:20:49.618 --> 00:20:49.938]  Again, that's 800-809-4491.
[00:20:59.912 --> 00:21:04.776]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:21:04.876 --> 00:21:05.656]  What have we got?
[00:21:05.856 --> 00:21:07.998]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:21:08.318 --> 00:21:09.059]  A republic.
[00:21:09.319 --> 00:21:11.901]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:13.882]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:21:14.243 --> 00:21:16.144]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:21:16.264 --> 00:21:17.525]  So they think they own our land?
[00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:19.066]  They think they own our water?
[00:21:19.266 --> 00:21:19.667]  Children?
[00:21:19.867 --> 00:21:20.647]  Our education?
[00:21:21.008 --> 00:21:21.628]  Our money?
[00:21:21.808 --> 00:21:25.471]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:21:25.831 --> 00:21:29.496]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:21:29.536 --> 00:21:30.498]  You're being warned.
[00:21:30.798 --> 00:21:31.639]  We have the facts.
[00:21:31.839 --> 00:21:32.941]  We have the Constitution.
[00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:33.882]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:21:33.902 --> 00:21:34.743]  We have common law.
[00:21:34.783 --> 00:21:37.046]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:37.327 --> 00:21:41.092]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:21:41.192 --> 00:21:45.975]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:21:46.156 --> 00:21:47.516]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:21:47.657 --> 00:21:48.477]  Don't tread on me.
[00:21:48.737 --> 00:21:55.182]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:22:00.441 --> 00:22:04.902]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:22:45.918 --> 00:22:46.518]  That's goberkey.com.
[00:23:00.127 --> 00:23:02.449]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[00:23:28.106 --> 00:23:28.487]  I think so.
[00:23:45.168 --> 00:23:47.609]  You must have $10,000 in credit card debt.
[00:23:47.689 --> 00:23:49.550]  Call the American Debt Associates at 800-876-2966.
[00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:49.630]  800-876-2966.
[00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:49.830]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:56.853]  I'm going to be talking more about the North American Union and the design collapse of our Republic with Dan Dix coming up in the next hour.
[00:24:15.461 --> 00:24:23.967]  But as we talk about in the film Fall of the Republic, President Obama has brazenly violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[00:24:24.007 --> 00:24:28.930]  Constitution by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council, thus becoming the first U.S.
[00:24:28.991 --> 00:24:30.812]  President to chair the world body.
[00:24:33.033 --> 00:24:34.234]  And here it is today.
[00:24:34.374 --> 00:24:36.876]  Obama hauls Arizona before the U.N.
[00:24:37.236 --> 00:24:38.537]  Human Rights Council.
[00:24:38.997 --> 00:24:42.319]  Not only is the federal government suing Arizona on behalf of foreigners,
[00:24:43.416 --> 00:24:44.877]  Now he's taking them to the U.N.
[00:24:44.897 --> 00:24:46.477]  Do you see the U.N.
[00:24:47.458 --> 00:24:55.341]  going after Mexico, where they admittedly take, the government itself takes immigrants from Latin America and other countries that try to get into the U.S.
[00:24:55.361 --> 00:25:02.765]  through Mexico and put them in slave camps and run their credit and demand every bit of money they can out of their families overseas?
[00:25:04.325 --> 00:25:05.566]  No, that's not being discussed.
[00:25:05.746 --> 00:25:09.468]  Are the mass graves they find on a weekly basis?
[00:25:09.788 --> 00:25:11.969]  Normally, this doesn't even make the news.
[00:25:13.993 --> 00:25:19.358]  Normally, you just see it in regional news, but it doesn't make the national news.
[00:25:20.419 --> 00:25:21.860]  And this is part of the North American Union.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.600]  Here's another report.
[00:25:22.941 --> 00:25:23.181]  U.S.
[00:25:23.241 --> 00:25:25.143]  Census counted everyone as a citizen.
[00:25:26.618 --> 00:25:27.839]  Now here's Fox News.
[00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:30.461]  There's also AP Reuters reporting the exact same thing.
[00:25:30.821 --> 00:25:32.262]  We'll put it up on screen for you.
[00:25:32.622 --> 00:25:38.586]  Survivor details massacre of 72 migrants by drug cartel in Mexico.
[00:25:39.186 --> 00:25:50.274]  And he escaped like a concentration camp victim and got to the local police station who guaranteed knows that Los Zetas is sanctioned by the Mexican government and the U.S.
[00:25:50.334 --> 00:25:50.734]  government.
[00:25:51.074 --> 00:25:55.938]  And they're the muscle going after the other cartels that don't want their money through the central banks.
[00:25:56.998 --> 00:26:01.460]  A wounded migrant stumbled into a military checkpoint and led Marines to a gruesome scene.
[00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:05.622]  What may be the biggest massacre so far in Mexico's bloody drug war.
[00:26:05.682 --> 00:26:06.202]  No it's not.
[00:26:06.863 --> 00:26:09.884]  A room strewn with the bodies of 72 fellow travelers.
[00:26:10.244 --> 00:26:11.725]  Some piled on top of each other.
[00:26:12.005 --> 00:26:14.506]  Just a hundred miles from the goal, the U.S.
[00:26:14.546 --> 00:26:15.407]  border, Texas.
[00:26:16.571 --> 00:26:27.533]  The 58 men, 14 women, were killed, the migrant told investigators, Wednesday, by the Zetas Cartel, a group of former Mexican Army Special Forces known to extort migrants who pass through their territory.
[00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:29.773]  That's why you've got to shut down the border.
[00:26:30.514 --> 00:26:42.896]  You've got hundreds of millions of people from Latin America and Mexico trying to get here, who live in hell, and once they get here, the government turns them into an army of anti-gun, big government voters.
[00:26:44.888 --> 00:26:50.610]  They go to public schools and are so angry by citizens wearing American flags, the citizens are sent home.
[00:26:51.110 --> 00:27:01.754]  They're pulling down American flags at post offices and schools, running up Mexican flags, and then nobody's talking about Mexico, where the people are literally preyed on, including U.S.
[00:27:01.774 --> 00:27:02.214]  citizens.
[00:27:03.614 --> 00:27:08.016]  Used to, if you went to one of the controlled areas for tourists, you wouldn't get kidnapped by the police and extorted.
[00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:14.465]  But now you go to Cancun and other areas, the same thing happens that will happen in Central Mexico or Northern Mexico.
[00:27:15.426 --> 00:27:17.408]  But the travel agents won't tell you that.
[00:27:17.688 --> 00:27:21.052]  People send their high school graduates down there to be raped and robbed and killed.
[00:27:21.492 --> 00:27:22.753]  And it's happening every day.
[00:27:23.794 --> 00:27:26.057]  Mexico is a completely failed state.
[00:27:29.304 --> 00:27:42.967]  It goes on to talk about the horrifying example yet of the plight of migrants trying to cross the country where drug cartels are increasingly scouting shelters and highways hoping to extort or even recruit vulnerable immigrants.
[00:27:43.127 --> 00:27:47.028]  It's absolutely terrible and it demands the condemnation of all our society.
[00:27:47.048 --> 00:27:50.169]  It's a government security spokesman of Mexico.
[00:27:51.428 --> 00:27:53.448]  Well, it's very simple.
[00:27:53.688 --> 00:27:54.989]  If they don't have money, they kill them.
[00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:56.149]  They rape the women.
[00:27:56.669 --> 00:28:00.029]  They pull up to mayor's offices, grab the mayor, kill him.
[00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:02.050]  In many cases, rape him, torture him.
[00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:03.810]  They attacked the U.S.
[00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.551]  Embassy in what killed five employees just a month or so ago.
[00:28:07.131 --> 00:28:09.771]  They're now killing ranchers on the Texas and Arizona side.
[00:28:10.031 --> 00:28:11.491]  They've now got hits out on police.
[00:28:11.511 --> 00:28:12.312]  They're killing police.
[00:28:12.592 --> 00:28:15.412]  I've interviewed the sheriffs in Texas, many miles over the border.
[00:28:15.712 --> 00:28:17.653]  Mexican troops pull up, aim guns at them.
[00:28:17.873 --> 00:28:19.753]  The Mexican troops help bring the drugs in.
[00:28:21.761 --> 00:28:34.428]  And then Obama is suing Arizona and now sicking the UN, a foreign criminal consortium, on Arizona because Arizona would dare to try to deport illegals?
[00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:39.210]  See, they talk about the plight of migrants.
[00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:43.392]  Oh, we're not putting enough water stations out in the desert for them.
[00:28:43.652 --> 00:28:44.833]  We can't build a fence.
[00:28:47.205 --> 00:28:51.728]  Oh, we're going to put 1,200 troops on the border with a couple hundred on shift at any one time doing nothing.
[00:28:52.889 --> 00:28:57.112]  The Border Patrol has announced they're pulling back from the border in Arizona because it's, quote, too dangerous.
[00:28:57.492 --> 00:29:02.155]  And then they pull on our heartstrings and say, we've got to merge with Mexico.
[00:29:02.556 --> 00:29:04.817]  We've got to accept anybody who wants to come in.
[00:29:05.218 --> 00:29:06.058]  We've got to do this.
[00:29:06.178 --> 00:29:09.180]  No, we need to stop funding the government of Mexico.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.782]  We need to demand they totally decriminalize drugs.
[00:29:12.082 --> 00:29:15.445]  And it will end all of this violence very, very quickly.
[00:29:16.411 --> 00:29:19.854]  But you've got 500 billion a year coming out of Mexico in drugs.
[00:29:20.915 --> 00:29:23.697]  You've got 500 plus billion in opium coming out of Afghanistan.
[00:29:23.917 --> 00:29:27.580]  And the criminal banks that run our nation and run Mexico are the ones controlling it.
[00:29:29.382 --> 00:29:32.905]  And if you read deeply into these reports, many of the people they dig up
[00:29:33.988 --> 00:29:40.772]  I mean, there's been hundreds of abductions out of El Paso, where they take the women over to the other side and torture them, rape them, sacrifice them.
[00:29:41.192 --> 00:29:42.133]  This is lunacy.
[00:29:42.273 --> 00:29:48.217]  Insanity has seized control of Mexico, and it's spilling over and taking over the United States.
[00:29:50.078 --> 00:29:50.978]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.479 --> 00:29:53.080]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.702]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.363 --> 00:30:03.587]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:03.907 --> 00:30:04.187]  Number 1.
[00:30:04.828 --> 00:30:07.970]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.251 --> 00:30:08.811]  Number 2.
[00:30:09.111 --> 00:30:13.655]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:13.995 --> 00:30:14.456]  It's true.
[00:30:14.756 --> 00:30:19.300]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:20.161]  Number 3.
[00:30:20.441 --> 00:30:23.724]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.024 --> 00:30:27.727]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:27.927 --> 00:30:28.488]  Number 4.
[00:30:28.728 --> 00:30:31.089]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.872]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.173 --> 00:30:35.373]  Number 5.
[00:30:35.953 --> 00:30:39.876]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.096 --> 00:30:44.860]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:32:55.396 --> 00:32:56.197]  Check them out today.
[00:32:58.739 --> 00:33:03.724]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:23.456]  I'll be getting back into the North American Union and how a private consortium of banks is dissolving our sovereignty through treason at the presidential and congressional level as they sign away our authority.
[00:33:24.176 --> 00:33:29.938]  Obama is not only suing Arizona, he's now going to the UN asking them to go out to Arizona.
[00:33:30.458 --> 00:33:31.219]  That is coming up.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:53.637]  For the rest of this hour, and five minutes into the next hour, Don Adams, who we talked about in the last two days, a decorated Korean War vet, retired FBI agent, who was investigating one of the people he has evidence was involved in the JFK assassination before it even happened, saw a subsequent cover-up.
[00:33:54.177 --> 00:34:01.824]  The information he has literally blows the JFK murder and assassination and cover-up sky-high.
[00:34:03.044 --> 00:34:21.940]  And it integrates with the deathbed confession of E. Howard Hunt that we broke here on air with his son, the audio and video, and with all of the research I've done in the last 15 years, and of course the congressional report in the late 70s, finding 95% chance it was a conspiracy, not just Lee Harvey Oswald.
[00:34:23.098 --> 00:34:23.738]  Acting alone.
[00:34:24.098 --> 00:34:42.682]  So I'd like Don to go back to his time at the FBI, before the JFK assassination, and go through the newly released documents that concur, the fact that he got his own FBI reports out of the archives, that they've been altered, and just the amazing information.
[00:34:42.722 --> 00:34:46.283]  Because that's what E. Howard Hunt said, that the killing was planned in Miami,
[00:34:46.863 --> 00:34:58.791]  And they have the Miami intelligence police interviewing the person who was photographed in Dealey Plaza, the individual that Mr. Adams was tracking.
[00:35:00.047 --> 00:35:08.969]  And it fits in with the Secret Service agent that said they were going to try to kill JFK in Chicago, but that got called off because he blew the whistle.
[00:35:09.609 --> 00:35:12.509]  Same thing that Hunt is now saying right before he died.
[00:35:12.789 --> 00:35:14.610]  I mean, it's incredible information.
[00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:19.550]  Then he'll get into the physical evidence as well, the impossibility of the official story.
[00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:24.911]  So retired FBI agent Don Adams is here blowing the whistle.
[00:35:24.931 --> 00:35:26.011]  He has a lot of courage.
[00:35:26.332 --> 00:35:27.592]  Sir, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:35:27.612 --> 00:35:28.772]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:35:29.386 --> 00:35:30.347]  You've got the floor.
[00:35:30.387 --> 00:35:32.348]  The website's AdamsJFK.com.
[00:35:32.408 --> 00:35:34.690]  You've got a book coming out in the next few months.
[00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:38.112]  You've also got a DVD breaking this down, but you've got the floor.
[00:35:38.692 --> 00:35:39.473]  Go over it, sir.
[00:35:39.893 --> 00:35:40.514]  All right, I will.
[00:35:41.514 --> 00:35:46.337]  My investigation started in November, on November the 13th of 1963.
[00:35:46.538 --> 00:35:52.762]  I received a telephone call from the agent in charge in the Atlanta FBI office.
[00:35:53.782 --> 00:35:57.365]  He told me that they had just received information from the Secret Service.
[00:35:58.175 --> 00:36:07.058]  Of a conspiracy discussion that took place up in Indianapolis, Indiana, at a meeting of a large group of very strong right-wingers.
[00:36:09.039 --> 00:36:20.962]  And as a result of it, there was one of the people in a discussion of four people who was an informant for the Miami Intelligence Police Department, as well as for the FBI.
[00:36:21.582 --> 00:36:23.003]  His name is William Somerset.
[00:36:24.251 --> 00:36:29.393]  Uh, the principal person that was talking in the group of four was Joseph Adams Miltier.
[00:36:30.714 --> 00:36:52.442]  Uh, Joseph Adams Miltier, uh, and Somerset with the other two fellas, they planned, uh, I mean, they discussed about, uh, the assassination of President Kennedy when he left Homestead Air Force Base in Miami, Florida and traveled up Collins Avenue to the Kennedy compound in Palm Beach, Florida.
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:37:07.422]  They were going to take and secrete a man who was willing to give his life up in a palm tree, and then when the motorcade with the open limousine came by, they were going to go ahead and shoot the president.
[00:37:07.462 --> 00:37:15.544]  That person was a sniper in the Second World War, and so they planned on killing him there.
[00:37:16.184 --> 00:37:21.705]  If that failed, for whatever reason, they had a backup plan at the White House.
[00:37:22.512 --> 00:37:44.250]  Behind Lafayette Park, which is right across the street from the White House, and they had purchased or rented an apartment or an office, and they had purchased a high-powered rifle with a tripod, and they were going to shoot the President when he came out onto the portico of the White House, or if he walked the grounds.
[00:37:45.131 --> 00:37:46.692]  And that was their backup plan.
[00:37:47.552 --> 00:37:59.580]  So all this was discussed and as a result of it, the Secret Service called our SAC and asked for me to ask for an investigation to be conducted.
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:06.805]  The SAC called me and said, Don, since Milter lives in Quitman, Georgia in your territory, I want you to do a full background on him.
[00:38:07.765 --> 00:38:11.928]  So I contacted the police chief down there, William Elliott,
[00:38:12.683 --> 00:38:23.658]  And Bill and I went to work on on military and we spent about five days working full time gathering as much intelligence as we possibly could on him.
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.243]  Once we acquired all the intelligence that we could get.
[00:38:28.527 --> 00:38:32.569]  I then took and prepared a report, a pretty extensive report.
[00:38:33.049 --> 00:38:43.752]  I acquired a lot of handout material from him, which he memographed and he handed out every Saturday to all of the people that would take it.
[00:38:44.393 --> 00:38:56.797]  And I took a lot of that material from him and there was an awful lot of bitterness and indications, not direct threats, but implied threats against the President and Bobby and them.
[00:38:57.412 --> 00:39:01.653]  So I took all that material and I put it all together and hand carried my report.
[00:39:01.673 --> 00:39:03.753]  I wrote my report and I hand carried it up to Atlanta.
[00:39:04.273 --> 00:39:10.434]  Gave it to the boss and then turned it over to the Secret Service and we were through with it.
[00:39:11.315 --> 00:39:13.235]  That was our total investigation.
[00:39:14.475 --> 00:39:21.036]  I finished probably around the 18th or 19th, I can't give you an exact date, but around then.
[00:39:21.696 --> 00:39:24.117]  And then of course on November 22nd,
[00:39:25.649 --> 00:39:33.532]  At 1.30 in the afternoon, my partner and I were riding in the car, and an announcement came out and said that the President had been shot in Dallas.
[00:39:34.532 --> 00:39:46.116]  And then there was a radio code for Code 36 for us to go to the Thomasville, Georgia Highway Patrol post, and they had a message for me.
[00:39:46.176 --> 00:39:46.836]  So I went there,
[00:39:47.708 --> 00:39:54.131]  Identified myself, and he then said to me, the sergeant behind the desk, that we were going to go to the Department of Agriculture.
[00:39:54.531 --> 00:39:56.272]  They have a teletype they want me to read.
[00:39:56.812 --> 00:40:06.017]  So we took off, went to the Department of Agriculture, and once we got inside and looked at the teletype, the teletype read, the president is dead.
[00:40:06.577 --> 00:40:10.079]  Call your special agent in charge in Atlanta immediately.
[00:40:11.115 --> 00:40:21.563]  So then I immediately, I mean I was shocked and devastated because here it is so close to what I was doing and now they're talking about to call the boss on that.
[00:40:21.603 --> 00:40:28.568]  So I called my boss and he says find Miltier wherever he is and hold him for the Secret Service.
[00:40:29.609 --> 00:40:38.296]  And I'm devastated because I'm thinking I must have screwed up somehow or made a mess of something or something happened because of the close proximity and time.
[00:40:39.689 --> 00:40:46.974]  Uh, I went out and I started looking for Miltier, hunting him through all of his haunts and wherever he was.
[00:40:46.994 --> 00:40:53.217]  And I went from November 22nd to November the 27th and located him on the 27th.
[00:40:53.518 --> 00:41:07.286]  Uh, the first indication that I had that there was something going wrong was that my agent in charge told me that when you interview Miltier, you can only ask these five questions and nothing more.
[00:41:08.166 --> 00:41:20.763]  And I queried my boss, and I said, Boss, wait a minute, we're passing up a very important opportunity here to find out who he associated with, where he went, who he met in his travels, and everything else, and maybe I can get a lot of information from him.
[00:41:20.823 --> 00:41:24.248]  He said, I only want you to ask these five questions and nothing more.
[00:41:25.382 --> 00:41:26.623]  So I did.
[00:41:26.783 --> 00:41:30.685]  When we interviewed him, I took the statements on those five questions.
[00:41:31.186 --> 00:41:41.052]  He denied any involvement in the assassination, and one of them was concerning Martin Luther King, if there was any threats on him, and he denied any of that information.
[00:41:41.946 --> 00:41:56.690]  And as a result of it, I called my boss, and the boss said, go ahead and release him since he didn't give you anything of any positive nature in that, and the Secret Service will contact you if they decide they want him located and they want to talk to him.
[00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:58.350]  And that's the last I heard of him.
[00:41:59.271 --> 00:42:00.311]  And I forgot all about it.
[00:42:00.811 --> 00:42:04.632]  Then, seven months later, I was transferred to Dallas, Texas.
[00:42:06.067 --> 00:42:11.710]  When I got to Dallas, Texas, the first thing that my boss said to me was, I want you to look at the Zabruder film.
[00:42:12.771 --> 00:42:28.580]  I went in and looked at the Zabruder film, and when I looked at the Zabruder film, I saw him, I saw the president take his hands and go up towards his throat with his hands, and I made a comment with two senior agents sitting there with me, and I said, hell, he didn't get shot from the back, he got shot from the front.
[00:42:29.582 --> 00:42:39.362]  And I was cautioned by one of the agents and said, Don, the Warren Commission's already in here working to get this thing established and that, and I would kind of hold your comments to yourself.
[00:42:40.436 --> 00:42:44.900]  I left there a couple days later with two other senior agents and went to the book depository.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:50.845]  When I got to the book depository, I looked out the window and looked down on Elm Street, and there was a tree in full foliage.
[00:42:50.885 --> 00:42:57.651]  And I asked the two agents, I said, was that tree bare at the time when the assassination took place?
[00:42:57.691 --> 00:43:02.575]  They said, no, the timing is such, it's not like you have back at home in Ohio.
[00:43:03.756 --> 00:43:07.800]  The leaves were still on there in November and they're still on in June.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.281]  Yeah, Live Oaks dropped their leaves in the summer.
[00:43:11.221 --> 00:43:13.102]  Yes, okay, which they did do.
[00:43:14.022 --> 00:43:29.828]  So as a result of it, I made a comment, I said, there's no way in the world, if the forage is all up there, there's no way in the world that this individual, Oswald, or no, he wasn't named at that time, but whoever the individual was,
[00:43:30.601 --> 00:43:36.988]  Uh, that did the shooting and that, that he, oh no, I'm sorry, his name was already identified six months later.
[00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:45.078]  Uh, but anyway, this individual, uh, could not have possibly made those shots, three shots in seven and a half seconds.
[00:43:45.979 --> 00:43:48.762]  And again, I was cautioned and said, be careful what you say.
[00:43:49.719 --> 00:44:02.234]  So then that was my completion as far as I covered a couple of leads on the assassination when I worked in Dallas and then subsequently I made my transfers and stuff, went back to Ohio and forgot all about Miltier.
[00:44:03.395 --> 00:44:04.036]  In November of 1992,
[00:44:08.563 --> 00:44:21.472]  At Christmas time, we had a get-together at a house there, and one of the fellows that was there, it was a son of a friend of mine, he said, Mr. Adams, I understand that you're involved in the assassination investigation, and I'm a buff for that.
[00:44:21.572 --> 00:44:23.333]  Could you talk with me about it?
[00:44:24.013 --> 00:44:29.717]  I did, told him the whole story I just told you, and he said, fine, thank you very much.
[00:44:29.777 --> 00:44:33.620]  And then he said, I'm reading a book in my home in Houston.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.281]  When I finish it, I'll send it to you.
[00:44:36.036 --> 00:44:42.158]  So, about a month later, I received a package from him, and inside was the book.
[00:44:42.898 --> 00:44:45.759]  I opened up the book, and the name of the book was High Treason.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.101]  And it was written by Robert Groten and William Livingston.
[00:44:51.161 --> 00:45:02.085]  And when I opened up that, there was a piece of notes on the inside cover, and it said, Don Adams, Joseph A., is mentioned in the details, or in the appendix.
[00:45:02.245 --> 00:45:03.145]  Good reading, Larry.
[00:45:04.071 --> 00:45:13.033]  So then when I opened it up and went to the index, I was thinking to myself, hell, there's a lot of Joseph A's, and I never used his last name when I talked to the group at Larry's house.
[00:45:13.553 --> 00:45:15.774]  So I figured, you know, he's just got somebody else.
[00:45:15.794 --> 00:45:19.894]  But when I went to the index, it had Joseph Adams from up here in the index.
[00:45:20.575 --> 00:45:21.915]  I immediately went to the appendix.
[00:45:21.955 --> 00:45:25.896]  The appendix in there talked in terms of a tape-recorded conversation.
[00:45:26.516 --> 00:45:28.396]  And I want all your listeners to understand this.
[00:45:28.456 --> 00:45:29.316]  On November the 9th of 1963,
[00:45:33.359 --> 00:45:36.320]  Two weeks approximately, two weeks before the assassination.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:46:01.965]  Joseph Adams Miltier, in a tape-recorded conversation that was done by the Miami Intelligence Police Unit, placed a recorder in Somerset's apartment, and he was their informant, and they tape-recorded the conversation, and in that conversation, Miltier said that we're going to kill him from an office building with a high-powered rifle.
[00:46:09.685 --> 00:46:11.966]  Let me stop you right there for just a second.
[00:46:11.986 --> 00:46:15.626]  We're speaking with FBI agent Don Adams.
[00:46:15.666 --> 00:46:27.729]  This is amazing information and in a moment we're going to play a clip from the audio tape made by the Intelligence Bureau there in Miami, Florida.
[00:46:28.369 --> 00:46:28.749]  In fact,
[00:46:29.329 --> 00:46:34.052]  Let's go ahead, let's go ahead now and play a clip of this tape.
[00:46:34.772 --> 00:46:39.795]  Because separately you've got FBI agent Don Adams in Georgia investigating this guy before it happens.
[00:46:40.175 --> 00:46:46.619]  Then he learns this guy's shooting his mouth off so much and hanging out with these gribs in Miami that we now know we're planning it.
[00:46:46.999 --> 00:46:53.243]  Headed up, of course, by famous CIA black op commander E. Howard Hunt.
[00:46:53.843 --> 00:46:59.405]  Who ran assassinations worldwide, deathbed confession, talking about how it was planned in Miami.
[00:46:59.806 --> 00:47:09.310]  Here he is in Florida, Joseph Adams Miltier, saying to the police undercover, yeah, we're going to kill him in Dallas, and we're going to kill him with a rifle.
[00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:14.832]  And then later, the cops go back and get another interview, and he's saying, see, I told you we were going to kill him.
[00:47:15.092 --> 00:47:16.853]  You think I was playing games, boy?
[00:47:17.153 --> 00:47:18.514]  Let's go ahead and play that audio.
[00:47:18.534 --> 00:47:18.954]  Here it is.
[00:47:19.694 --> 00:47:30.685]  But the most startling discovery was a tape recording captured by Miami intelligence officers November 9th 1963 just weeks before Dallas.
[00:47:31.425 --> 00:47:34.548]  Miltier is talking to the informant William Somerset.
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:51.190]  The FBI headquarters and Secret Service both had that tape within days.
[00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:53.956]  I should have stopped the President from traveling instantly.
[00:47:54.517 --> 00:47:55.319]  But they didn't.
[00:47:55.751 --> 00:47:57.393]  And he says he was jubilant.
[00:47:57.773 --> 00:47:58.934]  Bragging to Somerset.
[00:47:59.234 --> 00:48:03.078]  You thought I was kidding when I said he would be killed from a window with a high-powered rifle.
[00:48:03.818 --> 00:48:09.003]  Despite all of that, Miltier was never even mentioned in the Warren Commission report.
[00:48:09.404 --> 00:48:13.908]  When Hoover set up the propaganda in the FBI, don't embarrass the FBI.
[00:48:14.388 --> 00:48:15.209]  That was his rules.
[00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:16.470]  And you didn't.
[00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:20.454]  So they ordered everything put into the archives and to be forgotten about it.
[00:48:20.774 --> 00:48:25.979]  But Don can't forget, and hopes something is done before the truth is buried forever.
[00:48:25.999 --> 00:48:31.364]  I mean, when we die off, when we're gone, there's not going to be anybody who's going to sit here and tell you these things.
[00:48:31.745 --> 00:48:35.188]  All right, going back now to retired FBI agent Don Adams.
[00:48:35.228 --> 00:48:40.613]  That must have hit you like a thunderbolt when all this came out, that other police agencies
[00:48:41.614 --> 00:48:48.700]  You know, had the guy talking about how they were going to kill him in Dallas, and then bragging after the fact, I told you we were going to kill him!
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.902]  I mean, this is open and shut, isn't it?
[00:48:51.262 --> 00:49:07.215]  Yes, it devastated me to have that type of positive information on a tape recording by the two people that we were dealing with as far as that time element is concerned, and then for him to make that positive statement.
[00:49:07.915 --> 00:49:14.216]  He should have been stopped, the President's travel should have been stopped immediately and he should have not gone to Dallas.
[00:49:14.696 --> 00:49:33.800]  Well Don, the real issue here is, and of course you've researched this, you know about it, the black secret service agent that knew it was coming in Chicago, so they moved it from Chicago to Dallas, and of course he said that decades ago, and then documents did come out, and then there's a deathbed confession by E. Howard Hunt, the famous black op,
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.721]  I mean, we've just got it all right there!
[00:49:55.029 --> 00:49:56.771]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:49:57.431 --> 00:49:59.934]  I heard about statements and that.
[00:50:00.354 --> 00:50:07.962]  I've never listened to it personally, but when you start tying all the knots together, Nat, you're going to come up with an answer.
[00:50:08.662 --> 00:50:10.965]  And all this information that
[00:50:11.605 --> 00:50:14.847]  If they had it in their hands, I got none of it.
[00:50:15.287 --> 00:50:19.110]  I knew nothing about the 9th Cape Recording.
[00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:30.777]  I knew nothing that military had been interviewed by my partner a year before in 1982 on a civil rights investigation.
[00:50:31.437 --> 00:50:33.799]  My partner said nothing to me about it at all.
[00:50:35.236 --> 00:50:40.719]  William Elliott worked with my partner a year before that in 82, and he said nothing to me.
[00:50:41.099 --> 00:50:45.001]  And we worked together extensively every day doing the workup on Miltier.
[00:50:45.781 --> 00:50:48.743]  Now, why in the hell was this stuff kept from me?
[00:50:50.984 --> 00:50:58.309]  You know, when I go back in 93, I mean, back to 93, when all this stuff started and that, I was devastated.
[00:50:58.789 --> 00:51:00.650]  I was totally shocked to think that
[00:51:01.557 --> 00:51:09.960]  My own agency, the FBI, had covered this whole thing and delayed giving me... I mean, there was no proper investigation conducted in Dallas.
[00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:19.123]  They named Oswald, and once that was done, everything generated on Oswald and Miltier was forgotten.
[00:51:19.543 --> 00:51:21.404]  And then they killed their Patsy and...
[00:51:21.984 --> 00:51:34.959]  Fletcher Prouty, who himself was the main liaison between the Pentagon and CIA black ops, he got literally sent away to the North Pole so that he wouldn't be there when all this happened.
[00:51:34.979 --> 00:51:40.386]  And he explained how they use mafia, they use hitmen, they use right-wing veterans.
[00:51:40.646 --> 00:51:46.190]  And they had all these different teams, including more teams down the road if Kennedy would have escaped.
[00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:51.954]  Now they have just multiple hit teams ready to deal with it.
[00:51:52.194 --> 00:51:57.437]  They even had the military in the air above Dallas in case the public found out and things had to be suppressed.
[00:51:57.718 --> 00:52:03.862]  They had the corrupt mafia-controlled Dallas Police Department all hooked up, heavily involved with intelligence.
[00:52:04.442 --> 00:52:09.686]  And it's just absolutely incredible that you were there, you tried to stop it,
[00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:21.204]  You were on the job, and then decades later, they declassify and release the fact that this guy was talking about killing him, and where, and how, and when, before and after.
[00:52:21.224 --> 00:52:22.586]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:52:23.354 --> 00:52:25.695]  Alex, let me mention one thing to you that's very important.
[00:52:27.556 --> 00:52:32.117]  After we went into the archives in 99 or, no, it was later than that.
[00:52:32.157 --> 00:52:34.098]  It was in 2003 or something like that.
[00:52:34.478 --> 00:52:37.159]  We went into the archives and pulled the documents from that.
[00:52:37.619 --> 00:52:52.445]  I found a document in there that said in there that they contacted, that the Atlanta office had contacted their agent in Thomasville, and he told them that Botier was at Equipment Georgia at the time the assassination took place.
[00:52:53.371 --> 00:52:57.393]  And that was an outright lie, and it's a totally fraudulent document.
[00:52:57.874 --> 00:53:02.376]  The document was done, and the words were said, but it was not true.
[00:53:03.097 --> 00:53:09.020]  And my partner was the only one that was there, and I left him saying I was going to find Miltier.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.082]  I was going to locate him if I could, and which we did.
[00:53:12.142 --> 00:53:19.046]  I checked him in the morning and then noon at night, and here he, at some time or somebody, saying that he did it.
[00:53:19.766 --> 00:53:23.069]  Uh, moments before the president was killed.
[00:53:35.219 --> 00:53:35.639]  That's right.
[00:53:35.719 --> 00:53:39.240]  I interrupted you, Agent Adams, before you got to that.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:48.442]  So recap, you get this book, you open it up, and there he is, clear as day, looking at the President in the motorcade.
[00:53:48.682 --> 00:53:49.322]  Talk about that.
[00:53:49.902 --> 00:53:50.103]  Sure.
[00:53:50.183 --> 00:54:00.465]  I mean, you can imagine when you investigate a person and you do a full background on him, and I walked up to him, like I said, and I took all this hate literature from him, which he was really giving out in that.
[00:54:01.466 --> 00:54:11.825]  I spent a lot of time with this guy, and then when I finally took him into custody and took him back for interview and everything on the 27th, there was a lot of time together.
[00:54:12.512 --> 00:54:13.913]  And I know him 100%.
[00:54:13.953 --> 00:54:20.757]  And when I saw that photograph, it hit me like a, like you said, like a stack of bricks hit me.
[00:54:21.277 --> 00:54:23.418]  And it just, it blew my mind.
[00:54:23.458 --> 00:54:24.179]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:54:24.719 --> 00:54:25.519]  But here he is.
[00:54:25.539 --> 00:54:27.501]  Because I couldn't locate him.
[00:54:27.541 --> 00:54:35.105]  And then I found out afterwards that on the same morning, on November the 22nd at 10 o'clock in the morning,
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:47.609]  Before he was photographed there on Houston Street, he made a telephone call to Somerset in Miami and told him, I'm in jackrabbit country, your friend is coming here and you're not going to see him again.
[00:54:48.809 --> 00:54:59.197]  And then when I said, or you mentioned later on that that Miltier was jubilant over, he was when he met with Somerset the following day after the assassination at the Jacksonville
[00:54:59.804 --> 00:55:00.485]  We're good to go.
[00:55:14.684 --> 00:55:17.848]  Well, another incredible issue is the police, both local and federal, were doing their job.
[00:55:17.868 --> 00:55:18.989]  You were on him.
[00:55:29.941 --> 00:55:32.703]  You've got the Florida police are on him.
[00:55:32.943 --> 00:55:36.146]  He's getting off the train from Texas, obviously.
[00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:37.767]  And he's saying, I told you.
[00:55:37.967 --> 00:55:44.532]  They got him two weeks before saying we're going to kill him with a high-powered rifle out of a building, you know, in Dallas.
[00:55:44.833 --> 00:55:47.835]  And then he gets back and, you know, the undercover is there recording him.
[00:55:47.855 --> 00:55:49.236]  He's like, I told you, boy.
[00:55:49.256 --> 00:55:51.538]  I mean, this is open and shut.
[00:55:51.918 --> 00:55:56.922]  Now, you talk about Joseph Adams' military being a World War II sniper, being a really violent.
[00:55:56.942 --> 00:55:57.362]  No, no, no.
[00:55:57.402 --> 00:55:57.863]  He was.
[00:55:57.983 --> 00:55:59.023]  One of the four was.
[00:55:59.304 --> 00:55:59.744]  One of the four?
[00:56:00.104 --> 00:56:13.847]  Yeah, see, the meeting that took place in Indianapolis and that, Miltier was really the spokesman and Somerset was the informant and then one of the other two persons was a sniper in the Second World War.
[00:56:14.287 --> 00:56:19.389]  And he said that he was willing to go up into the tree and give his life and that to take Kennedy out.
[00:56:20.229 --> 00:56:20.749]  Amazing.
[00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:23.189]  So who was Joseph Adams Miltier?
[00:56:23.209 --> 00:56:25.090]  Because the news reported he was a really violent guy.
[00:56:25.666 --> 00:56:31.187]  Well, it said in a report in that book, in the High Treason Study, he was one of the most violent men in the country.
[00:56:32.367 --> 00:56:33.888]  Here's another thing about it.
[00:56:33.968 --> 00:56:40.149]  My partner, who had investigated me here before, said nothing to me about him ever being armed.
[00:56:40.689 --> 00:56:53.952]  And one of the most stringent rules that we have in the FBI is, if you develop any information where there's a possibility of an agent getting harmed or hurt or killed, it's mandatory that you immediately put a caution out
[00:56:54.372 --> 00:56:55.653]  We're good to go.
[00:57:18.425 --> 00:57:19.966]  And I knew nothing about that.
[00:57:20.026 --> 00:57:28.593]  So here's my partner did everything he could against every proper bureau rule to protect me and the chief and everybody else.
[00:57:29.413 --> 00:57:33.816]  And they got rid of every bit of that information and gave none of it to me.
[00:57:34.397 --> 00:57:35.638]  Whatever happened to Miltier?
[00:57:36.465 --> 00:57:45.292]  Bill Tuerer had an explosion of a gas stove in his house, and the early reports were that he got killed because of that.
[00:57:45.772 --> 00:57:53.559]  But then I read some smart reports after that which said that he was burnt just slightly from the explosion of the gas.
[00:57:54.486 --> 00:57:59.111]  I'm not sure about this, but I believe it was like 74 that he finally passed away then.
[00:58:15.848 --> 00:58:16.448]  Amazing.
[00:58:16.608 --> 00:58:18.649]  We're going to come back and do a few more minutes with you.
[00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:19.590]  Okay.
[00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:31.476]  Because you also, in some of the news reports I've seen, sir, you talk about how you finally got your original reports back out of the archives and they'd been altered.
[00:58:31.776 --> 00:58:34.217]  So that's even more evidence that there's a cover-up going on.
[00:58:34.558 --> 00:58:37.099]  We'll talk about it all coming up after this quick break.

[00:59:52.576 --> 00:59:54.516]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.956 --> 00:59:57.737]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.161 --> 01:00:04.801]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.482 --> 01:00:06.502]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.243 --> 01:00:08.363]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.003 --> 01:00:09.824]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.584 --> 01:00:11.545]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.145 --> 01:00:15.807]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.327 --> 01:00:20.449]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:25.732]  Here's the headline from WJW.
[01:00:26.632 --> 01:00:29.334]  Retired FBI agent says Oswald didn't kill Kennedy.
[01:00:30.472 --> 01:00:33.097]  They go on to say it's a lot more than conspiracy theories.
[01:00:33.758 --> 01:00:35.041]  It's documented fact.
[01:00:35.602 --> 01:00:38.908]  I mean, this is the police surveillance recordings, the informants.
[01:00:41.118 --> 01:00:50.046]  So you've got the good ground floor FBI people and police and others trying to stop this, but up high, they block the investigation, they cover it up.
[01:00:50.087 --> 01:00:51.228]  And that was my next question.
[01:00:52.389 --> 01:01:00.937]  I had read that you had said that once you got into the archives, decades after, when they finally released this stuff, that your own FBI reports had been doctored.
[01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:02.251]  What happened?
[01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:04.614]  My report doesn't exist.
[01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:17.649]  I mean, they eliminated the total report that I wrote up, and my partner, Royal McGraw, and a supervisor by the name of Charles Harding up in Atlanta, Georgia, they wrote two reports.
[01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:19.691]  One written by McGraw and one written by
[01:01:22.408 --> 01:01:23.229]  Uh, Charles Hardy.
[01:01:23.909 --> 01:01:39.218]  And, uh, they took the material of all the people that I contacted and interviewed, trying to locate Miltier, and doing a full background on him, education-wise, and where he worked, and all the stuff that we had acquired, and all of that was in their reports.
[01:01:39.999 --> 01:01:47.383]  The only thing that was in that report that had anything to do with Don Adams was that one sheet of paper of my interview of Miltier.
[01:01:48.043 --> 01:01:50.485]  Well, sir, isn't the evidence of the cover-up
[01:01:51.574 --> 01:01:52.535]  I mean, just more proof.
[01:01:52.595 --> 01:01:57.399]  I mean, look at how many people that witnessed the shooters on the grassy knoll, the green pickup truck.
[01:01:58.059 --> 01:02:02.102]  How many of them were murdered, killed, disappeared?
[01:02:02.423 --> 01:02:02.683]  Over 300.
[01:02:04.124 --> 01:02:13.911]  I mean, there's been a novel written about and discussing solely the people that were involved in the Kennedy assassination, and they say that that number is over 300 people now.
[01:02:15.152 --> 01:02:21.077]  And I just want to mention one thing that I don't want to forget to tell you, is that when I saw it as a brooder film,
[01:02:21.767 --> 01:02:22.908]  And I made that comment.
[01:02:22.948 --> 01:02:27.911]  Hell, he wasn't shot from the back, he was shot from the front, when he put his hands up to his throat and that.
[01:02:29.071 --> 01:02:42.439]  Dr. Charles Crenshaw, who worked in Trauma Room 1 at Dallas Parkland Hospital and that, when he, as soon as he looked at the President, he said, hell, he's been shot in the throat, he's got a bullet hole here.
[01:02:43.348 --> 01:02:43.548]  I don't
[01:03:01.128 --> 01:03:04.912]  Go all the way through him and it went into his throat and stayed in his body.
[01:03:05.072 --> 01:03:12.058]  Yeah, that was in the original medical report and then they had his brain at the National Archives and then it got disappeared.
[01:03:12.078 --> 01:03:13.099]  It disappeared, right.
[01:03:13.299 --> 01:03:17.683]  In closing, sir, I want to have you back up in the next month for a full hour with your great breadth of knowledge.
[01:03:17.943 --> 01:03:23.447]  We appreciate your patriotism, your love of the truth, and your courage knowing how many people they've murdered.
[01:03:24.208 --> 01:03:25.169]  Do you ever get threatened?
[01:03:25.209 --> 01:03:27.271]  Are you concerned that you're now really going public?
[01:03:27.745 --> 01:03:29.225]  No, I'm going to tell you something, Alex.
[01:03:29.285 --> 01:03:30.206]  I've always said this.
[01:03:30.646 --> 01:03:33.907]  The good Lord picked me for this assignment, whatever it was.
[01:03:34.567 --> 01:03:35.467]  I mean, whatever it is.
[01:03:36.168 --> 01:03:40.189]  And if He decides He's going to call me, I'm going to go the way He wants.
[01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:42.089]  And I don't worry about that stuff.
[01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:46.050]  And I would imagine you really learned that when you were in Korea.
[01:03:46.631 --> 01:03:47.211]  Yes, I did.
[01:03:47.691 --> 01:03:49.371]  Yeah, I saw a lot there.
[01:03:49.431 --> 01:03:50.412]  And it was a heavy year.
[01:03:50.432 --> 01:03:54.593]  I went all the way to the Yellow River, up to China.
[01:03:55.379 --> 01:04:02.262]  And, uh, it was an experience I never forgot, but it's something that taught me a great deal about life and how important life is.
[01:04:03.183 --> 01:04:06.945]  You know who else was on the Yalu River but fighting the Japanese during World War II?
[01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:09.626]  E. Howard Hunt, as a sniper!
[01:04:10.026 --> 01:04:10.826]  Wow, wow.
[01:04:11.427 --> 01:04:15.889]  Yeah, see, I, uh, let me tell you something, Alex, so that you're aware of how I work and that.
[01:04:16.449 --> 01:04:24.413]  When I get to concentrating on my work and that, I don't dwell off into a lot of other people's work, because you could just go in forever.
[01:04:25.233 --> 01:04:37.684]  No, I agree with you because your area of the investigation is conclusive.
[01:04:38.444 --> 01:04:39.665]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:04:40.086 --> 01:04:42.828]  The website is AdamsJFK.com.
[01:04:43.268 --> 01:04:44.629]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[01:04:44.689 --> 01:04:47.612]  I look forward to setting you up for a full hour in the next month.
[01:04:48.192 --> 01:04:50.056]  We'll try to set that up with you right now, sir.
[01:04:50.417 --> 01:04:51.539]  Everybody check out his website.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:56.670]  He's got some very informative DVDs with his testimony that's an important part of a historical record.
[01:04:59.656 --> 01:05:04.520]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.400]  What have we got?
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.742]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:05:08.062 --> 01:05:08.803]  A republic.
[01:05:09.063 --> 01:05:11.665]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:05:11.725 --> 01:05:13.646]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:05:13.987 --> 01:05:15.888]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:05:16.008 --> 01:05:17.289]  So they think they own our land?
[01:05:17.689 --> 01:05:18.810]  They think they own our water?
[01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.411]  Children?
[01:05:19.631 --> 01:05:20.411]  Our education?
[01:05:20.732 --> 01:05:21.352]  Our money?
[01:05:21.572 --> 01:05:25.215]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:05:25.575 --> 01:05:29.219]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:30.260]  You have been warned.
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.381]  We have the facts.
[01:05:31.581 --> 01:05:32.682]  We have the Constitution.
[01:05:32.742 --> 01:05:33.623]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:05:33.643 --> 01:05:34.483]  We have common law.
[01:05:34.523 --> 01:05:36.786]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:37.046 --> 01:05:40.869]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:05:40.929 --> 01:05:45.734]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:05:45.894 --> 01:05:47.275]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:05:47.375 --> 01:05:48.235]  Don't tread on me.
[01:05:48.475 --> 01:05:58.999]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:05:59.439 --> 01:06:03.661]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered generator.
[01:06:03.981 --> 01:06:04.561]  Number one.
[01:06:04.881 --> 01:06:08.883]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.183 --> 01:06:13.724]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.065 --> 01:06:14.505]  It's true.
[01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:20.227]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.507 --> 01:06:23.788]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.088 --> 01:06:28.570]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:31.151]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:31.551 --> 01:06:34.933]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:35.233 --> 01:06:35.753]  Number 5.
[01:06:36.013 --> 01:06:39.935]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.175 --> 01:06:44.937]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:07:59.935 --> 01:08:04.979]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.359 --> 01:08:07.581]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:16.914 --> 01:08:17.296]  Yeah.
[01:08:24.264 --> 01:08:28.026]  Wow, that was an incredible interview with that retired FBI agent.
[01:08:28.586 --> 01:08:30.007]  Just amazing, Don Adams.
[01:08:30.027 --> 01:08:33.629]  We're going to be having him back up for a full hour coming up in a few weeks.
[01:08:34.530 --> 01:08:36.010]  Incredible information.
[01:08:36.751 --> 01:08:43.174]  I mean, they had the police, they had the FBI, the recordings of him saying we're going to kill JFK in Dallas in his motorcade.
[01:08:43.555 --> 01:08:47.397]  Then he gets back days after and then tells the informant, I told you we were going to kill him.
[01:08:48.217 --> 01:08:49.618]  I mean, this is amazing.
[01:08:49.638 --> 01:08:51.080]  We have the audio tape.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:09:00.089]  We have E. Howard Hunt, the former black op commander who ran assassinations worldwide on record, saying they planned it in Florida, in Miami.
[01:09:01.004 --> 01:09:07.512]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on how open and shut this situation is.
[01:09:07.652 --> 01:09:09.053]  And he's shot in the throat.
[01:09:09.734 --> 01:09:14.019]  The Dallas doctors say he had a bullet in his throat.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.862]  They were told to change it, but they refused and kept a copy.
[01:09:17.363 --> 01:09:20.587]  This is the type of incredible information going on.
[01:09:20.987 --> 01:09:22.129]  Now, shifting gears.
[01:09:23.516 --> 01:09:34.558]  At the start of the broadcast today, I covered Fox News, AP, you name it, Survivor Details Massacre of 72 migrants by drug cartel in Mexico.
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:41.545]  And he escaped, he says Los Zetas, who on record was trained by the CIA to go after the other drug cartels that they don't control.
[01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:43.006]  They work for the Mexican government.
[01:09:43.306 --> 01:09:49.471]  He is robbing and extorting and trying to force the migrants, mainly from Central and South America, that's who they kill.
[01:09:49.731 --> 01:09:53.654]  They don't tend to do it as, they still kill a lot of them, but not as many of their Mexican citizens.
[01:09:54.034 --> 01:09:57.897]  So it's a form of nationalism against Central and South American migrants.
[01:09:58.838 --> 01:10:01.179]  And it's all part of the North American Union.
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:06.184]  And just a whole house full of 72 butchered, chopped up bodies.
[01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:11.770]  And the police are pulling up in front of mayors' houses in Mexico, dragging them out, murdering them in public.
[01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:13.632]  And this is all pouring over.
[01:10:13.652 --> 01:10:20.659]  And if you read Robert Pasteur's own documents and his CFR plan for the North American Union that's being implemented by stealth,
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.241]  That's the key term.
[01:10:22.702 --> 01:10:24.205]  Implementation by stealth.
[01:10:24.705 --> 01:10:27.750]  Stealth integration of Canada, the U.S.
[01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:28.491]  and Mexico.
[01:10:29.233 --> 01:10:31.817]  And under this new system, we don't have our liberties and freedoms.
[01:10:31.857 --> 01:10:32.838]  They're rewriting it.
[01:10:33.993 --> 01:10:52.318]  And Judicial Watch in 2006, they sued in 2007, got the Banff Canada Security Prosperity Partnership, NAU documents, and they said, we've got to keep it secret, the official minutes, we're taking over by stealth, we're going to use border crises as a pretext to merge the countries.
[01:10:52.718 --> 01:10:59.400]  Just like the banks use the derivatives crisis they created to get more power and set up a Bank of the World and a new derivatives tax.
[01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:04.904]  A new carbon tax, a new system, a new Ponzi scheme.
[01:11:05.464 --> 01:11:12.610]  And so all of this integrates in and dovetails with the information that Dan Dix covers.
[01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:15.272]  Now I knew he put this film out a few months ago.
[01:11:16.112 --> 01:11:17.073]  More than a few months ago.
[01:11:17.734 --> 01:11:18.914]  It had to be like six months ago.
[01:11:19.355 --> 01:11:20.616]  And I'm so busy I didn't watch it.
[01:11:21.732 --> 01:11:23.093]  There's so many documentary films.
[01:11:23.113 --> 01:11:28.697]  I've interviewed them before as an activist fighting tyranny in Canada at the G20, but I hadn't watched it.
[01:11:29.338 --> 01:11:32.900]  And they sent us a copy and said we'd like you to post this for your members at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:11:34.508 --> 01:11:39.973]  And it took us about a month to get around to uploading it and all that and encoding in the different formats.
[01:11:40.613 --> 01:11:41.694]  And I started watching it.
[01:11:41.734 --> 01:11:43.596]  It's a full-length film and I couldn't quit.
[01:11:44.056 --> 01:11:46.659]  I mean, this is as high production quality as we have.
[01:11:47.259 --> 01:11:48.720]  Very skilled filmmakers.
[01:11:49.181 --> 01:11:50.302]  But it's not just that.
[01:11:50.762 --> 01:11:51.803]  It's who they got in
[01:11:53.004 --> 01:11:56.266]  The interviews that completely blew me away.
[01:11:56.286 --> 01:12:00.628]  So we are selling United We Fall, three nations, two sides, one union.
[01:12:01.308 --> 01:12:05.690]  Press for Truth presents a Brian Law film with Dan Dix.
[01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:09.552]  And Dan Dix joins us via video link from Canada.
[01:12:09.832 --> 01:12:14.654]  Dan, break down why you made this film and the incredible interviews you got.
[01:12:14.674 --> 01:12:19.637]  Because somebody like myself, and we have called Pasteur, the head globalist that wrote up
[01:12:20.197 --> 01:12:23.279]  The specific North American integration plan, and he wouldn't be interviewed.
[01:12:23.699 --> 01:12:30.423]  So, because you're not as well known, you were able to get these interviews where top globalists admit, we want world government.
[01:12:30.483 --> 01:12:34.505]  I mean, this is a, and the interviews look like PBS or something.
[01:12:34.585 --> 01:12:47.493]  I mean, you guys are talented cinematographers, talented researchers, incredibly talented graphics folks, and I just want to hail you and Brian Law as amazing researchers and filmmakers.
[01:12:48.544 --> 01:12:50.046]  Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[01:12:50.066 --> 01:12:52.289]  That means a lot to me, coming from you.
[01:12:52.349 --> 01:12:53.290]  I really appreciate that.
[01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:53.611]  Thanks.
[01:12:54.171 --> 01:12:55.132]  No, no, listen.
[01:12:55.653 --> 01:12:59.178]  I mean, it's no brag, just fact, as John Wayne would say.
[01:12:59.518 --> 01:13:02.322]  Break down why you made the film and what's in it.
[01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:13.479]  Sure, yeah, it was about two years ago Brian and I set out to make this film which basically documents this push towards a North American Union.
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:20.165]  This concept of Canada, US and Mexico coming together into a union very similar to this European Union.
[01:13:20.966 --> 01:13:25.831]  We tracked it somewhat chronologically going through the various trade deals
[01:13:26.711 --> 01:13:31.112]  Throughout time, starting back as far as the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs.
[01:13:31.913 --> 01:13:34.293]  From there we move on to the Free Trade Agreement.
[01:13:34.893 --> 01:13:38.214]  Then we get, of course, into the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[01:13:38.534 --> 01:13:43.976]  And then after that we touch on the Security and Prosperity Partnership and the North American Leaders Summit.
[01:13:44.456 --> 01:13:50.758]  And we show how these are all incremental steps which are pushing us towards this idea of a North American Union.
[01:13:51.298 --> 01:13:59.562]  And also how the North American Union in itself is another big step towards the even bigger picture of a global governing body.
[01:13:59.842 --> 01:14:02.884]  So that's what we set out to do nearly two years ago now.
[01:14:02.984 --> 01:14:04.565]  The film is two years in the making.
[01:14:05.005 --> 01:14:08.507]  And we just released it on Canada Day, actually, a few months ago.
[01:14:09.027 --> 01:14:10.528]  And yeah, seems to be going well.
[01:14:11.755 --> 01:14:15.620]  Well, again, my film, Endgame, is almost three hours long.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:20.085]  It covers the full spectrum of global government, spends about 35 minutes on the NAU.
[01:14:20.666 --> 01:14:27.494]  Your film, in a riveting, non-stop way, in their own words, you've got
[01:14:27.694 --> 01:14:28.615]  It's them admitting it.
[01:14:28.635 --> 01:14:33.459]  It's not just Alex Jones showing documents and voicing it and saying, look what they said.
[01:14:33.839 --> 01:14:36.881]  You've actually got these people admitting it.
[01:14:36.981 --> 01:14:37.842]  And this is treason.
[01:14:37.882 --> 01:14:41.425]  This is a private corporate takeover of our governing system.
[01:14:41.505 --> 01:14:47.449]  It's giving corporations the power, just like we see BP being above the states and the federal government in the Gulf.
[01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:50.011]  This is global corporate governance.
[01:14:50.332 --> 01:14:52.914]  Break down some of the people you got interviews with.
[01:14:53.968 --> 01:15:02.938]  Sure, yeah, we really wanted to get this right from the horse's mouth, so we contacted a lot of the major players who were involved with the push towards this thing.
[01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:10.787]  Members of the Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission, and of course the Canadian Council of Chief Executives.
[01:15:11.427 --> 01:15:14.271]  Some of these people, for instance, are Alan Gottlieb.
[01:15:14.852 --> 01:15:17.736]  He is a member of the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission.
[01:15:18.277 --> 01:15:22.262]  He was the former Canadian Ambassador to the States from 81 to 89.
[01:15:22.302 --> 01:15:23.604]  So these are top-level guys.
[01:15:26.349 --> 01:15:28.370]  Robert Pastor, as well, to speak to us.
[01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:33.593]  John Manley, who is now the President of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives.
[01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:40.617]  And we also spoke with Herbert Grubel, who is considered the father of the Amero.
[01:15:41.618 --> 01:15:45.320]  So, we really did get the opinion of these guys from the horse's mouth.
[01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:54.204]  Setting up these interviews, we would basically, you know, these guys have big egos, Alex, and we would basically massage their egos.
[01:15:54.305 --> 01:15:54.845]  We would say,
[01:15:55.485 --> 01:16:03.971]  You know, I've read your documents, I've read your books, I'm very interested to get your opinion on deeper integration between the three countries.
[01:16:04.531 --> 01:16:10.575]  We would never use words like North American Union, because we knew that might scare them off from wanting to talk to us.
[01:16:11.315 --> 01:16:20.961]  And we also knew that they would be doing background checks on us, so we did keep my name out of the emails, because they would have found my website, my YouTube channel.
[01:16:21.081 --> 01:16:30.466]  I already made a film called The Nation's Deathbed on a similar topic, so we purposely left my name out of the emails, that way we wouldn't, you know, tip them off as to the angle that we wanted to cover.
[01:16:30.486 --> 01:16:36.610]  Well, this is a major coup, and because it's their admitting global government, they're admitting their plan, and you talk about
[01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:50.519]  Uh, this, you know, head of this corporate body in Canada and when you read the SPP, North American Union documents, or the EU documents, it states that they give the power to these private corporate bodies.
[01:16:50.559 --> 01:16:55.402]  When you read the hundreds of pages of SPP documents that Judicial Watch got,
[01:16:56.042 --> 01:16:58.163]  It's the heads of the top U.S.
[01:16:58.183 --> 01:17:13.146]  corporations, about 45 or so, the heads of the biggest Canadian corporations, and the heads of the major Mexican corporations, the real owners, and they're there agreeing on the policy and then saying, we must do this by stealth.
[01:17:13.606 --> 01:17:14.987]  We must have a carbon tax.
[01:17:15.327 --> 01:17:17.688]  We'll use a flu crisis to merge the countries.
[01:17:17.968 --> 01:17:20.748]  We'll use an immigrant crisis to merge the countries.
[01:17:21.088 --> 01:17:23.009]  We'll play groups off against each other.
[01:17:24.016 --> 01:17:42.342]  It's still secret what Bush signed with with Vicente Fox in Texas two years before that at Baylor and so we have our presidents at open treason going under total corporate governorship and now here we are with the North American Union
[01:17:43.502 --> 01:17:55.469]  They did have a press conference in 2007 on the White House lawn, this is in-game, with Merkel, Barroso and Bush saying, we're now merging the North American Union with the American integration, they don't call it union, using code words.
[01:17:56.890 --> 01:18:03.814]  And so that integration's already happening, and now they've bankrupted the economy as we said they would, having their own IMF World Bank documents, 2002 BBC.
[01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:21.171]  They are now merging this entire system and coming out with a new Bank of the World, naming their new global SDR currency the Bancor, and it's all now coming out in the open, but they still tried to deny it on the nightly news to the general public.
[01:18:21.211 --> 01:18:23.594]  They'll come out and admit it, but then still deny it.
[01:18:23.974 --> 01:18:24.535]  It's crazy.
[01:18:25.424 --> 01:18:26.345]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:18:26.365 --> 01:18:30.931]  I mean, I confronted Paul Martin about signing the SPP in 2005.
[01:18:31.131 --> 01:18:34.274]  I questioned him on his Bilderberg attendance.
[01:18:34.775 --> 01:18:39.441]  I asked him why he signed the SPP when there was no kind of referendum on it.
[01:18:39.921 --> 01:18:43.145]  And he basically shrugged it off as conspiracy theory.
[01:18:43.205 --> 01:18:45.468]  He made a joke about being in the Bilderberg group.
[01:18:46.228 --> 01:18:50.151]  So yes, in the public eye, these guys often just shrug it off as conspiracy theory.
[01:18:50.171 --> 01:19:00.958]  You'll see in the film, Herbert Grubel says, you know, I would put this concept into the same category as people who believe that Elvis Presley is still alive.
[01:19:02.039 --> 01:19:12.026]  So it's almost a bit of a double speak going on, because at one moment they will call it conspiracy theory, and then the very next moment they openly talk about this is exactly what we are doing.
[01:19:12.861 --> 01:19:16.324]  Well, that's right, and you bring up that central point.
[01:19:16.344 --> 01:19:33.999]  That made international news when in a press conference to the Prime Minister, to the Canadian leader, you said, hey, you signed the North American Union Agreement, the SPP, secretly in Texas, and he just said, oh, that doesn't exist, ha, ha, ha.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.661]  When it's on record, he did it.
[01:19:36.201 --> 01:19:54.596]  And then separately, the CFR, written by Robert Pasture, puts out a document that Congress then tries to pass as so-called immigration reform, that is the North American ID card, and now they're offering hemispheric travel IDs in Mexico, in the U.S., and in Canada, that are globally standardized.
[01:19:54.896 --> 01:19:59.780]  Let's talk more about the amazing documentary film, United We Fall, on the other side of this break.
[01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:02.481]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[01:20:02.701 --> 01:20:11.366]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.
[01:20:11.546 --> 01:20:21.771]  If you owe $10,000 or more in credit card bills and are struggling to make minimum payments, get ready to take down this number for free information that could potentially save your home the lifestyle you're accustomed to.
[01:20:22.051 --> 01:20:22.692]  I don't think so.
[01:20:45.148 --> 01:20:47.610]  You must have $10,000 in credit card debt.
[01:20:47.670 --> 01:20:53.395]  Call the American Debt Associates at 800-876-2966.
[01:20:53.415 --> 01:20:55.136]  800-876-2966.
[01:20:56.077 --> 01:20:58.619]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.862]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[01:21:02.302 --> 01:21:05.405]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[01:21:05.865 --> 01:21:13.812]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[01:21:14.332 --> 01:21:19.258]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[01:21:19.818 --> 01:21:24.944]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[01:21:25.444 --> 01:21:32.933]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness and put up tons of free food, too.
[01:21:33.473 --> 01:21:38.475]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[01:21:38.915 --> 01:21:40.196]  Our foods are their enemy.
[01:21:40.756 --> 01:21:46.218]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[01:21:46.598 --> 01:21:49.259]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[01:21:49.579 --> 01:21:53.041]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[01:21:53.081 --> 01:21:55.061]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence.
[01:21:59.736 --> 01:22:02.057]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:22:02.137 --> 01:22:04.338]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:22:04.458 --> 01:22:07.280]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:12.403]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:22:12.763 --> 01:22:16.965]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:19.606]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:22:19.726 --> 01:22:22.148]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:22:22.508 --> 01:22:25.089]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:33.034]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:22:33.365 --> 01:22:38.629]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:22:38.749 --> 01:22:41.011]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:22:41.591 --> 01:22:45.034]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:46.234]  And I got news for you.
[01:22:46.354 --> 01:22:47.675]  You're everyone else.
[01:22:47.715 --> 01:22:48.696]  Invisible Empire.

[01:22:59.116 --> 01:23:00.317]  Attention to all U.S.
[01:23:00.357 --> 01:23:07.943]  drivers who own a vehicle that has less than 130,000 miles with an auto warranty about to expire or no warranty coverage at all.
[01:23:08.303 --> 01:23:14.388]  Due to our country's economic crisis and auto repair costs on the rise, if your vehicle has less than 130,000 miles, as of today,
[01:23:16.710 --> 01:23:26.617]  You could be one of the millions of drivers that now may qualify to have your vehicle covered under United Repair Plans and have 100% of your future covered auto repair bills paid for you.
[01:23:26.997 --> 01:23:31.680]  This low-cost vehicle service contract has been established under United Repair Plans.
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:38.545]  And is now available to the general public in order to save drivers thousands of dollars on auto repairs during our country's recession.
[01:23:38.965 --> 01:23:47.312]  If you own a vehicle with less than 130,000 miles, you may now call to see if your vehicle qualifies and for a free 5-minute quote.
[01:23:47.672 --> 01:23:48.593]  Number to call is 800-809-4491.
[01:23:48.613 --> 01:23:48.653]  800-809-4491.
[01:23:48.673 --> 01:23:48.993]  Again, that's 800-809-4491.
[01:24:03.516 --> 01:24:08.504]  Day after day, alone on a hill.
[01:24:12.431 --> 01:24:13.191]  You know what I'm going to do?
[01:24:13.331 --> 01:24:26.917]  I'm going to open the phones up for Dan Dix for the rest of the hour, dealing with Mexico being collapsed by design, the establishment five years ago launching a war against cartels they didn't control, knowing it would destabilize the country.
[01:24:27.357 --> 01:24:31.979]  The SPP documents show they wanted to use border crises to do this.
[01:24:31.999 --> 01:24:35.421]  It all ties together, and the magnitude
[01:24:36.302 --> 01:24:41.781]  ...of this corrupt offshore group of banks that have taken over the planet's finances through fraud.
[01:24:43.271 --> 01:24:48.212]  Doing this by stealth is so outrageous, and if we can just expose it, it will implode.
[01:24:48.632 --> 01:24:50.072]  The film is United We Fall.
[01:24:50.833 --> 01:25:00.895]  It's available at PrisonPlanet.tv for members in high quality, or I suggest you support the filmmakers and us, our operation, and buy the DVD United We Fall 1995.
[01:25:01.375 --> 01:25:07.736]  You can get a second copy, and when you buy a second copy of it to give family or friends, you get three films for free.
[01:25:08.536 --> 01:25:11.038]  Fabled Enemies, exposing 9-11, excellent film.
[01:25:11.318 --> 01:25:14.320]  How Weed Won the West, exposing the phony drug war and government drug dealing.
[01:25:14.841 --> 01:25:15.902]  And American Dictators.
[01:25:16.002 --> 01:25:17.703]  Three films, four free.
[01:25:17.723 --> 01:25:19.704]  We're running this special for two weeks.
[01:25:20.325 --> 01:25:25.649]  When you buy two copies of United We Fall, you get three films free.
[01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:26.930]  We have another special going.
[01:25:28.746 --> 01:25:31.190]  In fact, I'll show listeners this right now and then go back to our guests.
[01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:32.852]  And I'm only running this for two weeks.
[01:25:32.872 --> 01:25:34.415]  You know, we've been doing specials every two weeks.
[01:25:34.875 --> 01:25:40.384]  Terror Storm, How We Won the West, Fabled Enemies, Reflections and Warnings with Aaron Russo, and American Dictators.
[01:25:40.484 --> 01:25:41.345]  Five films, $9.95.
[01:25:44.656 --> 01:25:48.238]  Hardcover, color cover, full-length films with extras.
[01:25:48.759 --> 01:25:51.720]  Even if you don't watch these and think you know it all, give them to people.
[01:25:52.241 --> 01:25:54.062]  $9.95, that's less than $2 a piece.
[01:25:54.402 --> 01:25:55.843]  People are going crazy over that special.
[01:25:56.243 --> 01:25:57.344]  InfoWars.com.
[01:25:57.764 --> 01:26:05.309]  But the toll-free number to call in and talk to Dan Dix about the G20, about globalism, about what the North American Union means, how we can fight it.
[01:26:06.049 --> 01:26:06.929]  1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:26:06.949 --> 01:26:24.477]  Going back to Dan Dix, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, but, I mean, from their own documents, from interviewing him, from what you cover in the film, people go, well, it's part of, you know, Star Trek that we're going to have one government.
[01:26:24.937 --> 01:26:27.238]  They've kind of preconditioned us with
[01:26:28.999 --> 01:26:36.088]  With these fables, self-fulfilling prophecies, predictive programming, that this is a foregone conclusion.
[01:26:36.328 --> 01:26:38.951]  But this isn't a happy, lovey, utopian world government.
[01:26:39.212 --> 01:26:43.898]  This is a global, corporate dictatorship that wants eugenics as their endgame.
[01:26:45.387 --> 01:26:56.662]  Yeah, well Alex, one of my favorite scenes in the film is when we ask Robert Pastor his opinion on the idea that this North American Union could be leading towards a global governing body.
[01:26:57.043 --> 01:26:59.986]  And he looks at us and says, uh, you mean one world government?
[01:27:00.487 --> 01:27:02.368]  And we say, yeah, yeah, what do you think about that?
[01:27:03.309 --> 01:27:13.937]  And just to watch him sit there and just stare at the camera and blink, and you could see the thought just going through his head, he had to choose his words very, very carefully.
[01:27:14.297 --> 01:27:16.058]  He didn't really know how to answer the question.
[01:27:16.579 --> 01:27:23.684]  And like a professional politician, he eventually kind of answered the question without actually answering the question, as they often do.
[01:27:24.244 --> 01:27:26.886]  But you could see that he was, you know, stuck there.
[01:27:27.246 --> 01:27:29.328]  At the time I was operating the B camera,
[01:27:29.688 --> 01:27:32.369]  And I just, you know, I couldn't help but have a smile on my face.
[01:27:32.449 --> 01:27:35.130]  I was like, wow, this says a lot about this guy right now.
[01:27:35.210 --> 01:27:35.870]  Yeah, what did he do?
[01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:40.871]  He paused for about four or five seconds and was blinking literally like a deer in the headlights.
[01:27:41.791 --> 01:27:44.412]  He was literally like a deer in the headlights.
[01:27:44.592 --> 01:27:49.454]  I think he was a little bit shocked that we would ask him such a question on camera.
[01:27:49.834 --> 01:27:51.934]  And I think it was a little bit more than four or five seconds.
[01:27:51.974 --> 01:27:54.635]  He sat there and just did not know what to say.
[01:27:55.235 --> 01:27:57.956]  And, you know, that's one of my favorite scenes in the film.
[01:27:59.229 --> 01:28:01.850]  Well, I mean, as I was saying, you've knocked it out of the park.
[01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:03.690]  You got interviews with Vicente Fox.
[01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:07.051]  I mean, where he admitted it's world government.
[01:28:07.311 --> 01:28:11.312]  Then he went on Larry King Live and said, yes, it is going to lead to a one world government.
[01:28:11.332 --> 01:28:13.413]  It is going to lead to a North American Union.
[01:28:13.953 --> 01:28:17.994]  And you did get some of the globalists to admit in the film that they do want world government.
[01:28:19.490 --> 01:28:22.553]  Yeah, some of them were open about speaking about it.
[01:28:22.573 --> 01:28:31.380]  They wouldn't use those terms, but they would certainly say that unity is what we need.
[01:28:32.421 --> 01:28:33.582]  Like, for instance, Paul Martin.
[01:28:33.722 --> 01:28:44.171]  Well, we asked them all about their concept of sovereignty as well, and each one of them said that we have to rethink the concept of sovereignty.
[01:28:44.732 --> 01:28:46.213]  John Manley sat there and said,
[01:28:46.853 --> 01:28:53.137]  I find it amusing people who put sovereignty in this crystal jar as if it's the be-all and end-all.
[01:28:53.798 --> 01:29:02.364]  So they kind of laugh off the concept of sovereignty and Robert Pastor even went as far to say that people like myself and you are the problem.
[01:29:02.684 --> 01:29:08.628]  We are slowing down progress and that we are in fear of change.
[01:29:08.948 --> 01:29:11.330]  Which, of course, is not the case whatsoever.
[01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.650]  No, no.
[01:29:11.710 --> 01:29:19.876]  They have a stealth, secretive, forced global government that its open goal is to, quote, destroy industrialized society.
[01:29:19.916 --> 01:29:21.217]  That's Club of Rome UN.
[01:29:21.818 --> 01:29:24.199]  And so this is a corporate stealth takeover.
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:30.304]  And then they bring in the paramilitary police to suppress you after they've gotten corporate control.
[01:29:30.344 --> 01:29:30.724]  Stay there.
[01:29:30.964 --> 01:29:37.689]  You've also got, not just the YouTube footage, but the actual crisp, original footage of police dressed up like anarchists
[01:29:38.650 --> 01:29:40.032]  Attacking their own officers?
[01:29:40.813 --> 01:29:48.523]  We're gonna play the trailer for the incredible documentary film, United We Fall, and then get into the provocateurs of your phone calls.
[01:29:50.005 --> 01:29:50.906]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.407 --> 01:29:52.989]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:56.614]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:29:59.195 --> 01:30:01.958]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:30:02.339 --> 01:30:05.863]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.

[01:31:56.158 --> 01:31:57.902]  This information is too important to wait.
[01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.910]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:04.251 --> 01:32:07.772]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:08.132 --> 01:32:10.414]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:10.594 --> 01:32:15.876]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:16.296 --> 01:32:22.519]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:22.959 --> 01:32:28.522]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:28.922 --> 01:32:32.624]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:32:33.104 --> 01:32:37.065]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:43.326]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:43.346 --> 01:32:46.307]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:46.887 --> 01:32:48.327]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:48.867 --> 01:32:49.367]  It's here.
[01:32:49.988 --> 01:32:56.789]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:59.842 --> 01:33:08.588]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:33:09.368 --> 01:33:10.409]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:33:10.929 --> 01:33:14.692]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:17.073 --> 01:33:23.997]  You'll notice that when I start talking about the North American Union, I start talking faster and faster, I start stammering.
[01:33:25.018 --> 01:33:27.780]  It's one of the few subjects that
[01:33:28.894 --> 01:33:44.999]  At just a primitive level I get angry about, because I've read the UN documents, the CFR documents, watched the C-SPAN press conferences where they admit it all, read their reports, read all the stuff that Judicial Watch sued to get.
[01:33:45.019 --> 01:33:58.144]  The fact that they could keep it secret, treaties they've signed, and then we get the treaties and it says in the first line of the meeting, we've got to keep this secret, we've got to have integration by stealth,
[01:33:59.654 --> 01:34:13.283]  And to know this is their plan, and then some of them don't care, like Vicente Fox, he's like, yes, we're integrating North American Union, and other globalists admit it, and then to have them go on the news and make fun of us, even make fun of Lou Dobbs, ran him out of his highly rated job.
[01:34:13.643 --> 01:34:14.864]  His house got shot up.
[01:34:16.505 --> 01:34:18.226]  Because he's reporting the truth!
[01:34:20.027 --> 01:34:25.011]  And to read in the SPP, where they said we'll use crises, economic,
[01:34:25.894 --> 01:34:46.748]  Flu, biological, huge flows of migrants to know the UN, on record in the last 30 years, ran the indigenous populations off their land all over Central and South America, but also in Mexico, forcing them up here, then using them as a weapon to drive down wages, the giant sucking sound that Ross Perot talked about.
[01:34:47.088 --> 01:34:47.969]  This is treason!
[01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:53.232]  Obama becoming the first head of the UN Security Council is a sitting president.
[01:34:53.713 --> 01:34:54.273]  It's treason.
[01:34:54.293 --> 01:34:55.494]  Let me read you the subsection.
[01:34:57.516 --> 01:34:58.957]  Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[01:34:58.997 --> 01:35:03.622]  Constitution, by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council, thus becoming the first U.S.
[01:35:03.662 --> 01:35:04.704]  President to chair the world body.
[01:35:05.464 --> 01:35:12.732]  And when he was there, they had Kissinger and all these other globalists, George Soltz, and Obama was thanking them, and they were in rapture.
[01:35:13.673 --> 01:35:15.174]  at the precedent they were setting.
[01:35:15.615 --> 01:35:27.565]  See, they're building a global government where they write the rules, where they're immune from taxes, regulations, but they write the regulations on you and your government takes that money and pays it to them.
[01:35:28.045 --> 01:35:30.587]  That's why when I saw the new film
[01:35:31.601 --> 01:35:31.921]  I don't know.
[01:35:50.077 --> 01:35:55.581]  Gave it to us to post on PrisonPlanet.TV graciously because you wanted our members to see it.
[01:35:56.101 --> 01:36:00.785]  Where do you guys stand on people not selling it because you need to keep your copyright?
[01:36:00.825 --> 01:36:04.808]  We've discovered that ourselves because if you just say do whatever you want people then try to take it away from you.
[01:36:05.108 --> 01:36:09.811]  But where do you stand on viewing parties or people making copies to give their friends and family?
[01:36:10.071 --> 01:36:11.112]  Where do you stand on that?
[01:36:11.172 --> 01:36:13.514]  Because United We Fall needs to be a big hit.
[01:36:14.833 --> 01:36:18.075]  Uh, we absolutely fully encourage that, Alex.
[01:36:18.175 --> 01:36:20.617]  We would, in fact, ask people to do just that.
[01:36:20.637 --> 01:36:27.100]  Uh, burn copies of it in high quality and give them out to your friends, uh, family members, total strangers.
[01:36:27.621 --> 01:36:33.104]  Um, that is absolutely key to getting this information out there because awareness is key at this time.
[01:36:34.004 --> 01:36:39.266]  So when you do get the DVD, you not only get the film, but we went all out on this DVD, Alex.
[01:36:39.306 --> 01:36:41.847]  We have over two hours of extras.
[01:36:42.347 --> 01:36:43.588]  We have deleted scenes.
[01:36:43.648 --> 01:36:45.268]  We have a lot of special features.
[01:36:45.389 --> 01:36:47.129]  Stuff we just simply couldn't put in the film.
[01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:49.150]  A lot of behind-the-scenes stuff.
[01:36:49.710 --> 01:36:52.211]  We have a behind-the-music featurette.
[01:36:52.311 --> 01:36:56.153]  I wrote and played all the music and all the sounds that you hear in the film.
[01:36:56.533 --> 01:36:59.254]  So Brian made a little special feature on that.
[01:37:00.174 --> 01:37:03.756]  We also did a director-producer commentary.
[01:37:04.436 --> 01:37:07.457]  So when you get the DVD, you also get a lot of extra stuff.
[01:37:07.777 --> 01:37:16.341]  And then, of course, we fully, fully encourage people to make copies, hand them out for free, because getting this information out there is absolutely key at this point.
[01:37:16.541 --> 01:37:21.543]  Well, that's the mark of a true patriot, and we just salute you and your multi-talented
[01:37:22.816 --> 01:37:50.160]  gifts that you have bringing together this film united we fall three nations two sides one union a first rate bombshell weapon against the enemy can download it burn copies at prison planet dot tv get the dvd at info wars dot com get it get it out to everyone we have a discount when you buy two copies you get three of my films free info wars dot com or call toll free eight eight eight two five three three one three nine now i want to play the three minute trailer
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:53.804]  On air for the radio and TV viewers today, Dan.
[01:37:54.004 --> 01:37:55.546]  But I also want to have time to get to some calls.
[01:37:55.586 --> 01:38:08.640]  But briefly, you also in the film had the video in full living color of citizens catching police provocateuring and since then they've been caught in other cities in the US and in Europe
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:24.101]  Red-handed, another form of false flag terror to frame people that try to protest so they have a pretext to then snatch and grab citizens and bring in private contractors like we saw at the G20 a few months ago in Toronto.
[01:38:25.311 --> 01:38:26.351]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:38:26.371 --> 01:38:28.812]  This is becoming their modus operandi.
[01:38:29.172 --> 01:38:36.174]  When they want to shut down a legitimate protest, a lot of the times they will provide the excuse to do so.
[01:38:36.694 --> 01:38:46.057]  And just like we saw in Montebello, Quebec back in 2007, I was there and we documented in my previous film, The Nation's Deathbed,
[01:38:46.757 --> 01:38:59.166]  Where you do see three undercover police officers who are dressed looking kind of like the Black Block, you know, wearing the black, wearing the bandanas, and they had rocks in their hands in an attempt to incite violence.
[01:39:00.107 --> 01:39:00.928]  The Quebec police
[01:39:01.730 --> 01:39:08.733]  Did in fact admit to it and said, yes, these are our officers and they're simply performing their duties.
[01:39:09.714 --> 01:39:14.616]  So they are admitting that this is a common tactic that they are using.
[01:39:15.056 --> 01:39:23.420]  So now, just recently with the G8 and the G20 coming to Toronto, there are a lot of very, very, very questionable things
[01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:24.400]  I don't know.
[01:39:43.138 --> 01:39:47.779]  A lot of people may have seen some YouTube videos or seen clips on the news of what happened here.
[01:39:48.159 --> 01:39:52.860]  So we are currently working very hard on a new film to get that information out there as well, Alex.
[01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:56.741]  And notice it was the same thing that we saw in Pittsburgh.
[01:39:57.361 --> 01:40:05.643]  People in police uniforms, people in military uniforms, people in plain clothes, pulling up, grabbing citizens for no reason, throwing them in unmarked cars.
[01:40:06.043 --> 01:40:07.404]  Same thing happened in Toronto.
[01:40:07.424 --> 01:40:08.224]  This is a global
[01:40:08.744 --> 01:40:12.428]  Management and they always do it in front of news cameras to send the message.
[01:40:12.448 --> 01:40:24.182]  Hey, we snatch and grab and they snatch and grabbed Rob Due and took him to a military facility where hundreds of other people were getting off trucks with bags on their heads like they were Al Qaeda.
[01:40:25.509 --> 01:40:26.629]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:26.669 --> 01:40:27.990]  It's going on all over the place.
[01:40:28.090 --> 01:40:35.873]  Of course, as you know, Charlie Veitch was here in Toronto helping me cover it and they snatched him up right away.
[01:40:35.933 --> 01:40:43.596]  His first day here, he ended up spending 21 hours in the holding facility and just went through a horrendous ordeal there.
[01:40:45.377 --> 01:40:50.199]  There's certainly an attack on this information because they know it is key.
[01:40:50.699 --> 01:40:55.401]  They know we are having an effect and they're trying to shut it down at every step of the
[01:40:56.282 --> 01:41:11.250]  And he was out there being absurd, you know, saying all sorts of absurd things and saying, yes, I'm a secret police officer with the Love Police, and last time I heard they charged him with impersonating an officer when it's clearly a joke.
[01:41:11.530 --> 01:41:12.331]  Where has that gone?
[01:41:13.890 --> 01:41:16.491]  Well, there was a court case just a few days ago.
[01:41:17.452 --> 01:41:18.952]  We went down to cover it.
[01:41:18.992 --> 01:41:23.914]  There was about 300 people who had to show up at court on the same day to face their charges.
[01:41:24.714 --> 01:41:38.500]  I believe in Charlie's case, the Public Work Protection Act failing to show ID charge has been dropped, but they are not going to drop the impersonating a police officer charge.
[01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:44.625]  So his lawyer here in Canada is going to have to be fighting that for him, and it's just ridiculous.
[01:41:44.685 --> 01:41:50.509]  Anybody who sees the footage, if you watch the videos, you will see he is very, very clearly joking.
[01:41:50.549 --> 01:41:55.753]  That's all part of Charlie's style of activism is bringing humor to this movement.
[01:41:55.914 --> 01:42:06.182]  And by the way, they arrested him for not giving him the ID, then they released him, and they later charged him basically in absentia when he went back to England.
[01:42:07.321 --> 01:42:17.468]  Yeah, well, basically, they saw our video that we posted to my YouTube channel, youtube.com backslash weaving spider, and they saw that there and said, aha, we got him.
[01:42:18.228 --> 01:42:22.151]  We can now get him again and try to stifle his efforts.
[01:42:23.252 --> 01:42:28.375]  So he's obviously going to be a big part of our new film, because he spent the whole weekend with us there.
[01:42:29.516 --> 01:42:32.378]  So yeah, we're going to work hard to bring that to people.
[01:42:33.178 --> 01:42:33.599]  Amazing.
[01:42:33.639 --> 01:42:35.863]  Let's play the trailer and then go right to calls.
[01:42:36.183 --> 01:42:44.276]  Here is the trailer for the amazing film, United We Fall, available at PrisonPlanet.tv and on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:42:44.296 --> 01:42:44.636]  Here it is.
[01:42:50.896 --> 01:42:53.298]  Our economies now are very integrated.
[01:42:53.358 --> 01:42:55.881]  Our societies are growing increasingly integrated.
[01:42:56.461 --> 01:43:00.004]  What's needed now is a North American idea for all three.
[01:43:00.965 --> 01:43:06.590]  An idea that not only defines our shared history, but a shared destiny.
[01:43:08.632 --> 01:43:10.253]  Do you believe there will be another?
[01:43:10.273 --> 01:43:11.174]  I would hope so.
[01:43:11.394 --> 01:43:15.618]  It is the merger of the United States, Mexico and Canada into one super country.
[01:43:15.858 --> 01:43:20.162]  I had the idea, the inspiration to call it the Amaro.
[01:43:20.362 --> 01:43:24.005]  The Amaro is the proposed new currency for the North American community.
[01:43:24.246 --> 01:43:26.628]  That sounds an awful lot like the North American you need to be.
[01:43:27.508 --> 01:43:34.353]  Canadians are saying no to the North American Union and yes to Canada's sovereignty!
[01:43:34.614 --> 01:43:41.119]  I find it amusing when people put sovereignty in a kind of crystal jar and say, well, this is the ultimate.
[01:43:41.559 --> 01:43:45.222]  Canadians, Americans and Mexicans will lose their sovereignty.
[01:43:45.642 --> 01:43:48.044]  The Europeans have thrown sovereignty out the window.
[01:43:48.845 --> 01:43:51.347]  Maybe national sovereignty is not such a good thing?
[01:43:51.588 --> 01:43:57.514]  To understand what's happening, we should look at what has occurred under the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[01:43:57.535 --> 01:44:00.198]  These three guys are cops, everybody!
[01:44:00.218 --> 01:44:04.623]  It was implemented in a manner that closed it off to public scrutiny.
[01:44:05.223 --> 01:44:11.786]  And the only people who were invited into the room were the largest CEOs of the largest businesses in the three countries.
[01:44:12.527 --> 01:44:15.928]  Our country is being defined and shaped by corporations.
[01:44:16.128 --> 01:44:18.149]  It's not going to stop at the North American Union.
[01:44:18.489 --> 01:44:23.592]  It's going to be one further step along the road to one world government.
[01:44:23.872 --> 01:44:30.135]  We need a world of shared global rules, founded on shared global values.
[01:44:30.655 --> 01:44:33.657]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[01:44:34.037 --> 01:44:35.558]  New world order, one world government.
[01:44:36.518 --> 01:44:37.299]  One world government.
[01:44:42.026 --> 01:44:44.847]  Right now, there's a war on for your mind.
[01:44:45.127 --> 01:44:47.627]  We are losing our nation before our very eyes.
[01:44:47.987 --> 01:44:55.628]  People are slowly beginning to wake up to the fact that the fourth estate has simply not done their job.
[01:44:55.768 --> 01:44:56.969]  The people will resist.
[01:44:57.209 --> 01:45:03.210]  The people will stand up against them and not tolerate their power grab for the whole world.
[01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:08.531]  All it takes is for enough people to step out of the system to cause a crash.
[01:45:09.231 --> 01:45:11.291]  It is just a conspiracy theory.
[01:45:11.691 --> 01:45:13.693]  Who cares if they call you conspiracy theorist?
[01:45:13.713 --> 01:45:14.514]  This is the truth.
[01:45:15.134 --> 01:45:16.375]  You guys are my family!
[01:45:16.796 --> 01:45:17.897]  You guys are my friends!
[01:45:17.917 --> 01:45:24.262]  You guys are my companions in this info war!
[01:45:24.282 --> 01:45:25.423]  I personally think it will come.
[01:45:31.209 --> 01:45:31.629]  It will come.
[01:45:35.678 --> 01:45:36.838]  Alright folks, it's out.
[01:45:36.878 --> 01:45:41.140]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, United We Fall, amazing.
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:45.441]  I tell ya, the trailer looks good, well the film is just as good.
[01:45:46.021 --> 01:45:48.061]  I'm telling ya, everybody's gotta see it.
[01:45:48.101 --> 01:45:50.202]  The public is now ready to hear the truth.
[01:45:51.682 --> 01:45:53.443]  This film is a key weapon!
[01:45:54.764 --> 01:45:57.345]  Against these tyrants, the truth is our sword.
[01:45:57.666 --> 01:45:58.466]  Cut them down!
[01:45:58.486 --> 01:46:00.567]  Chris in Toronto, you're on the air.
[01:46:00.587 --> 01:46:01.007]  Go ahead.
[01:46:01.027 --> 01:46:02.768]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:46:02.808 --> 01:46:03.629]  Good afternoon, Dan.
[01:46:03.649 --> 01:46:05.730]  It's Shifi from Toronto Truthseekers.
[01:46:06.150 --> 01:46:08.792]  I'm calling in because I know Dan personally from Toronto.
[01:46:08.852 --> 01:46:11.273]  I just want to extend my personal congratulations to him.
[01:46:11.813 --> 01:46:13.174]  I've done activism with him.
[01:46:13.314 --> 01:46:16.856]  I know the amount of work that it took him along with Brian to get that film together.
[01:46:17.616 --> 01:46:19.539]  I saw it when it first came out, and you are right.
[01:46:19.559 --> 01:46:21.961]  It's definitely in par with any of your film, Alex.
[01:46:22.101 --> 01:46:30.431]  It's a great documentary, very insightful, and I definitely want to congratulate Dan, as well as Brian, on that amazing film.
[01:46:31.348 --> 01:46:34.429]  And I want to congratulate folks that are going to get it and get it out to everybody.
[01:46:34.469 --> 01:46:38.209]  They've done the hard work and been arrested and gone through hell to bring you this.
[01:46:38.690 --> 01:46:44.051]  Now, it's time for the population to take action with this information.
[01:46:44.091 --> 01:46:44.851]  Anything else, Chris?
[01:46:45.271 --> 01:46:45.771]  That'll be it.
[01:46:45.831 --> 01:46:46.191]  Take care.
[01:46:46.691 --> 01:46:47.631]  Thank you so much.
[01:46:48.592 --> 01:46:51.352]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brendan in North Carolina.
[01:46:51.372 --> 01:46:52.012]  You're on the air.
[01:46:52.752 --> 01:46:53.573]  Hey, Alex and Dan.
[01:46:53.593 --> 01:46:55.333]  Look, greetings from the Tar Heel State.
[01:46:55.493 --> 01:46:59.014]  When they start taking guns away, I think we'll probably be the last ones standing.
[01:46:59.034 --> 01:47:00.554]  That's for Texas.
[01:47:01.075 --> 01:47:02.296]  Hey, look, I got a question for you.
[01:47:02.316 --> 01:47:03.577]  It's a two-fold question, all right?
[01:47:04.918 --> 01:47:05.739]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:13.386]  Okay, look, I mean, if these guys are already running the show, you know, the Bilderbergers and these guys, and I believe they are, I'm with you on it, but this is a question I get asked a lot.
[01:47:13.806 --> 01:47:22.494]  What is the advantage, really, if they're already in charge, they're already in control, they're already wealthy beyond belief, what's the advantage to them, really, to collapsing society?
[01:47:23.155 --> 01:47:24.036]  And that's the part one.
[01:47:24.076 --> 01:47:25.076]  Wouldn't it really be better
[01:47:26.161 --> 01:47:27.944]  To run a successful society?
[01:47:27.964 --> 01:47:29.566]  I mean, if they collapse us, where's the innovation?
[01:47:29.606 --> 01:47:32.370]  Where's the technology that we have now?
[01:47:33.071 --> 01:47:34.313]  Let me answer that question.
[01:47:34.413 --> 01:47:36.496]  Okay, you have to look at what they are doing.
[01:47:36.976 --> 01:47:39.360]  We have the IMF World Bank documents.
[01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:41.102]  We have the Goldman Sachs.
[01:47:42.003 --> 01:47:43.084]  Emails and documents.
[01:47:43.124 --> 01:47:44.384]  It's not just Alex Jones.
[01:47:44.764 --> 01:47:48.926]  It's McClatchy News Service five-part series with Mr. Gordon.
[01:47:50.127 --> 01:47:53.549]  They are doing it because they have incredible money and power.
[01:47:54.069 --> 01:47:55.750]  They are dominating the globe.
[01:47:55.930 --> 01:47:59.332]  They don't have full control and they're selfish.
[01:47:59.472 --> 01:48:02.953]  They want to control the life extension technologies that are developing.
[01:48:03.294 --> 01:48:05.875]  They don't want to give it to seven or eight or nine billion people.
[01:48:06.315 --> 01:48:07.936]  They believe it's going to plane out at nine billion.
[01:48:08.456 --> 01:48:10.297]  They want you out of the way.
[01:48:10.377 --> 01:48:17.862]  They think you're a profane and ugly and stunted and they describe you as bugs and as useless eaters.
[01:48:17.942 --> 01:48:18.902]  Listen to Ted Turner.
[01:48:19.443 --> 01:48:23.565]  Listen to Jacques Cousteau saying we've got to kill millions of people.
[01:48:23.985 --> 01:48:26.287]  Listen to Prince Philip saying you're scum.
[01:48:26.507 --> 01:48:27.307]  He wants to kill 80% of you.
[01:48:27.327 --> 01:48:27.648]  Dr. Eric Pianka.
[01:48:30.089 --> 01:48:32.131]  They believe the world is theirs.
[01:48:32.191 --> 01:48:34.092]  It's called social Darwinism.
[01:48:34.652 --> 01:48:39.976]  And they believe that if they can kill you, it's their right to do it because survival of the fittest.
[01:48:40.317 --> 01:48:42.578]  This is their stated plan.
[01:48:43.059 --> 01:48:44.840]  They want a world government.
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:45.761]  They don't have it yet.
[01:48:46.001 --> 01:48:47.442]  They've got the banks, most the money.
[01:48:47.822 --> 01:48:49.163]  They're trying to get control.
[01:48:49.183 --> 01:48:51.004]  They're trying to put the surveillance grids in.
[01:48:51.324 --> 01:48:52.825]  They're trying to break up the family.
[01:48:53.305 --> 01:48:56.006]  I've got their own textbooks where they say the family's a disease.
[01:48:56.326 --> 01:49:01.569]  They want to remake man as a biological suboid android that serves them.
[01:49:01.629 --> 01:49:03.010]  Have you read Brave New World?
[01:49:03.230 --> 01:49:06.532]  He wrote Brave New World, revisited 30 plus years later.
[01:49:06.752 --> 01:49:08.993]  He was from a top British eugenics family.
[01:49:09.333 --> 01:49:11.915]  And he said, this is what we really are going to do.
[01:49:12.355 --> 01:49:13.335]  Read the book written in 32.
[01:49:14.616 --> 01:49:19.180]  And today, and it's everything that's in the news, they're not playing games!
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:21.802]  People say, well why would they want to hurt things?
[01:49:22.042 --> 01:49:24.944]  Why would they want to stop making money off of us?
[01:49:25.184 --> 01:49:26.686]  They print the stinking money!
[01:49:26.906 --> 01:49:28.227]  They issue the currency!
[01:49:28.427 --> 01:49:29.988]  They control the paradigm!
[01:49:30.188 --> 01:49:31.429]  They don't want us here!
[01:49:31.930 --> 01:49:32.851]  You understand that?
[01:49:33.251 --> 01:49:39.096]  And if every FBI agent, every cop, every teacher, every bureaucrat, everybody that makes up this system,
[01:49:39.756 --> 01:49:43.480]  You are in the crosshairs, just like I am, just like Dan Dix is.
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:44.641]  Dan, you want to answer his question?
[01:49:47.043 --> 01:49:48.104]  Oh, he cut out again.
[01:49:48.865 --> 01:49:51.728]  He's been dropping, that's why I haven't had him commenting for the listeners.
[01:49:52.408 --> 01:49:55.431]  Skype, video Skype's great, but it's still not perfected.
[01:49:56.252 --> 01:49:59.896]  We're going to just get him back on via phone, and we'll hold him a little bit in the next hour, then get our guest on.
[01:50:00.616 --> 01:50:01.978]  Brendan, does that answer your question?
[01:50:02.941 --> 01:50:04.621]  Oh yeah, I mean, it definitely does.
[01:50:04.681 --> 01:50:06.682]  I mean, I'm on the same page with you as well.
[01:50:06.702 --> 01:50:07.842]  I just, you just hear that a lot.
[01:50:08.202 --> 01:50:15.644]  People just can't seem to believe that, that they would want to, you know... Yeah, they can't believe that they're getting ready to raise Social Security age and start cutting it.
[01:50:16.004 --> 01:50:18.925]  They can't believe they're cutting cops everywhere but raising taxes.
[01:50:19.385 --> 01:50:22.606]  They can't, I mean, they can't, the people in Nazi Germany couldn't believe it.
[01:50:23.286 --> 01:50:25.328]  The people in Soviet Russia couldn't believe it.
[01:50:25.788 --> 01:50:29.111]  When the Romans would take over a village and kill everybody, they couldn't believe it.
[01:50:29.512 --> 01:50:39.521]  When a 10-year-old girl gets picked up by a man who had a puppy and candy, and an hour later strapped down with electrodes, shocking her as she's tortured to death, she can't believe it when she cries for mama.
[01:50:39.801 --> 01:50:40.462]  But it's real!
[01:50:40.942 --> 01:50:44.964]  So you tell your family and friends to get up off their butts and look at the evidence.
[01:50:45.384 --> 01:50:47.545]  Everything we're covering here is documented.
[01:50:47.705 --> 01:50:49.326]  There's no more time to screw around.
[01:50:49.586 --> 01:50:51.207]  Brendan, I appreciate your points.
[01:50:51.247 --> 01:50:52.108]  I'm glad you called.
[01:50:52.608 --> 01:50:55.890]  Alright, Stephanie, Steve, George, Damon and others, stay with us.
[01:50:56.090 --> 01:50:56.690]  We'll be back.
[01:50:56.770 --> 01:50:58.111]  Infowars.com!
[01:50:59.870 --> 01:51:00.330]  Attention!
[01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:05.373]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[01:51:05.473 --> 01:51:11.016]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[01:51:11.156 --> 01:51:18.120]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:24.323]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement.
[01:51:24.423 --> 01:51:27.724]  For you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[01:51:28.264 --> 01:51:31.184]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[01:51:31.424 --> 01:51:38.045]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[01:51:38.246 --> 01:51:47.047]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[01:51:47.187 --> 01:51:51.808]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[01:51:51.988 --> 01:51:53.609]  800-902-6969 800-902-6969 Again, 800-902-6969 Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:53.649 --> 01:51:58.674]  Did you know that the Global Elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:58.694 --> 01:52:01.216]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:52:08.743 --> 01:52:11.545]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[01:52:11.926 --> 01:52:17.010]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:17.511 --> 01:52:22.215]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:22.735 --> 01:52:29.661]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:29.861 --> 01:52:30.722]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:30.962 --> 01:52:33.704]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:33.724 --> 01:52:37.326]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:37.646 --> 01:52:40.488]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:40.828 --> 01:52:42.729]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:43.049 --> 01:52:43.930]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:43.950 --> 01:52:44.210]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:44.250 --> 01:52:47.132]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:47.632 --> 01:52:49.373]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:00.014 --> 01:53:02.936]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:53:03.036 --> 01:53:04.977]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:53:05.097 --> 01:53:07.739]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:53:07.839 --> 01:53:09.801]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:53:10.061 --> 01:53:11.262]  Okay, here it comes.

[01:53:13.383 --> 01:53:15.104]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:53:15.304 --> 01:53:17.026]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:53:17.306 --> 01:53:20.788]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:53:20.988 --> 01:53:28.393]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:53:28.733 --> 01:53:29.354]  Sinofresh.

[01:53:48.989 --> 01:53:49.329]  Mention GCN.

[01:53:50.289 --> 01:53:50.570]  It works!
[01:54:06.491 --> 01:54:08.492]  All right, Dan Dix now joins us via telephone.
[01:54:08.512 --> 01:54:09.613]  I want to go back to calls.
[01:54:10.213 --> 01:54:12.634]  But Brendan was asking, and I want you to be able to answer this.
[01:54:13.015 --> 01:54:15.916]  People say, well, why would the globalists want to destroy the economy?
[01:54:15.996 --> 01:54:17.797]  Why would they want to wreck things?
[01:54:17.877 --> 01:54:18.458]  Why would they?
[01:54:20.259 --> 01:54:23.520]  Because they're imaging the world according to their individual view.
[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:25.421]  They're not a bad person that wants to wreck things.
[01:54:25.782 --> 01:54:28.703]  So they don't understand this order out of chaos.
[01:54:28.723 --> 01:54:31.705]  You've got to destroy something before you build something on its ashes.
[01:54:32.505 --> 01:54:33.366]  Your comments on that?
[01:54:34.558 --> 01:54:35.138]  Absolutely.
[01:54:35.198 --> 01:54:42.141]  That's how they achieve anything that they want to get, is this concept of order out of chaos.
[01:54:42.861 --> 01:54:52.984]  They know if they can create enough problems, then out of the ashes of that will emerge their solution, which is always more of a push towards global government.
[01:54:53.284 --> 01:54:56.065]  So they've been utilizing this technique for many, many years.
[01:54:56.465 --> 01:54:58.326]  I mean, a lot of people say the same thing to me.
[01:54:58.366 --> 01:54:59.086]  They say, why would
[01:54:59.526 --> 01:55:01.966]  You know, why would anybody even want a North American Union?
[01:55:02.026 --> 01:55:03.647]  Nobody around here is going to go for it.
[01:55:03.707 --> 01:55:05.267]  Nobody in the States is going to go for it.
[01:55:05.387 --> 01:55:13.889]  And yeah, of course, at this point in time, yes, nobody around here wants a North American Union, but that could all change in a day.
[01:55:14.069 --> 01:55:17.769]  And tomorrow, people's opinions can easily be manipulated.
[01:55:18.309 --> 01:55:23.050]  They often use sometimes, you know, black ops, like false flag operations.
[01:55:23.250 --> 01:55:26.291]  It could be, you know, it could be an economic crisis.
[01:55:26.391 --> 01:55:28.231]  It could be a health crisis.
[01:55:28.512 --> 01:55:34.454]  Yeah, they always give solutions that only make it worse, but sell it to people that are ignorant as the solution.
[01:55:35.259 --> 01:55:54.803]  Absolutely, and the solution they had right from the get-go, and this is how they get their control, is by manipulating the population with this concept of order out of chaos, or, you know, the Hegelian dialectic, or it's more commonly referred to as problem-reaction solution.
[01:55:55.264 --> 01:55:58.024]  And that's how they pull this stuff off.
[01:55:58.224 --> 01:55:58.924]  Let's take a call.
[01:55:58.984 --> 01:56:01.025]  Stephanie in Texas, you're on the air with Dan Dix.
[01:56:02.281 --> 01:56:02.741]  Hi, Dan.
[01:56:02.801 --> 01:56:04.062]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:04.142 --> 01:56:06.102]  Thank you guys so much for the work you do.
[01:56:06.963 --> 01:56:09.344]  I applaud your efforts to wake up this world.
[01:56:09.944 --> 01:56:18.147]  A friend of mine just got in her renewal passport yesterday, and I compared it with her previous one, and I noticed two things I'd like to comment on and then ask a question.
[01:56:18.727 --> 01:56:27.991]  I noticed that there is a chip in there as well, and it also now, this year, compared to the last passport she had, it noticed the verbiage of don't bend.
[01:56:28.051 --> 01:56:30.452]  It's got an electromagnetic band in it.
[01:56:31.175 --> 01:56:35.057]  And no longer does it say that this is our passport.
[01:56:35.077 --> 01:56:37.658]  It's now the property of the United States.
[01:56:38.658 --> 01:56:41.680]  That gives me many angst for many reasons, as you can imagine.
[01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:47.282]  Yeah, it's saying your right to travel or leave or come into the country as a citizen is their property.
[01:56:48.023 --> 01:56:48.503]  Correct.
[01:56:48.863 --> 01:56:52.225]  And so now, and the previous one did not have that on there.
[01:56:52.265 --> 01:56:55.386]  So even though we're asked to pay for these passports,
[01:56:56.096 --> 01:57:08.663]  They're not really our property, so if you're traveling overseas and they've identified you as the good guy... Well, what did the North American Union travel ID that they're issuing to travel in Mexico or Canada?
[01:57:09.143 --> 01:57:13.445]  I mean, that's a hemispheric travel ID initiative.
[01:57:13.565 --> 01:57:14.146]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:57:15.086 --> 01:57:24.311]  Oh, so my question is, since they can take this back because it's not really ours, is there any other form of identification or ID that
[01:57:24.761 --> 01:57:28.842]  You know, we could come up with that we could actually say, this is ours, it's not yours.
[01:57:29.442 --> 01:57:34.963]  And that way, if you're ever traveling abroad, you know, you can have some type of ID that's really yours.
[01:57:36.744 --> 01:57:41.245]  Well, again, any tyranny doesn't want its slaves to be able to get out.
[01:57:42.185 --> 01:57:47.466]  And so, you can go and, I guess, get a foreign passport in some cases, but it's very serious.
[01:57:48.286 --> 01:57:50.027]  Let's get a comment from Dan Dix about that.
[01:57:50.067 --> 01:57:51.207]  I appreciate your call, Stephanie.
[01:57:52.664 --> 01:57:53.605]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:57:54.106 --> 01:57:59.731]  The, you know, what's going on in the airports and with the passports is getting worse and worse.
[01:57:59.911 --> 01:58:12.643]  With this North American Union idea, you know, John Manley was a part of this Nexus program, where they are using your biometrics in order to identify yourself so you can get through the lines quicker, faster.
[01:58:12.663 --> 01:58:17.348]  They say, you know, if you just scan your eye, it'll be much easier for you.
[01:58:18.128 --> 01:58:28.278]  They always play these things off as being for your benefit, but certainly travel is changing, you know, in this post 9-11 world, that's for sure.
[01:58:28.578 --> 01:58:29.559]  Absolutely, Dan.
[01:58:29.939 --> 01:58:30.540]  Stay there.
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:37.986]  We've got a big announcement on the other side, last five minutes with you, and we've got other key information coming up on some other subjects.
[01:58:38.006 --> 01:58:43.531]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.615 --> 01:58:47.830]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:58:49.264 --> 01:58:53.227]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:58:53.467 --> 01:58:59.512]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:58:59.872 --> 01:59:06.977]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:59:07.258 --> 01:59:11.841]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:59:12.141 --> 01:59:14.283]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:59:17.085 --> 01:59:20.587]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:59:20.827 --> 01:59:23.088]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:59:23.128 --> 01:59:23.448]  Call us.
[01:59:36.574 --> 01:59:47.760]  At 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:59:48.040 --> 01:59:48.461]  Thank you.
[01:59:52.423 --> 01:59:54.324]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.804 --> 01:59:57.586]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.133 --> 02:00:08.298]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:08.959 --> 02:00:09.760]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.561 --> 02:00:11.462]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.103 --> 02:00:15.788]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.288 --> 02:00:20.353]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.327 --> 02:00:26.253]  Quick program note that I'm going to talk about towards the end of the hour, and I'm going to play the video.
[02:00:26.954 --> 02:00:30.940]  We've been putting out one or two videos at YouTube, at the Alex Jones Channel.
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:36.347]  We've got hundreds of millions of views on YouTube, conservatively, that are getting between 400 and 600,000 views per video.
[02:00:39.674 --> 02:00:48.580]  And you now see the lawsuits about Prozac causing heart problems, causing people to commit suicide, other type drugs like that.
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:01:06.572]  And it turns out Lindsay Lohan was reportedly on Adderall, a form of speed, another serotonin reuptake inhibitor, a whole bunch of drugs, and a bunch of top doctors that interviewed her and did tests on her said that she was misdiagnosed and that these drugs are probably what's making her act crazy.
[02:01:06.952 --> 02:01:08.994]  But see, that's what's perfect for the system.
[02:01:10.066 --> 02:01:14.727]  Is that they put out drugs that cause people to have breakdowns and their answer is more drugs.
[02:01:15.288 --> 02:01:28.952]  And so we have a chance to get people that normally don't care about politics and health issues to watch an eleven minute video that I produced, that Rob Dew edited and put together, did a great job, that we just released a few hours ago.
[02:01:29.432 --> 02:01:35.194]  It's on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and the headline is Lindsay Lohan poisoned
[02:01:36.184 --> 02:01:39.707]  Along with 300 million other Americans.
[02:01:39.747 --> 02:01:47.393]  And it gets into the prescription drugs, it gets into the fluoride, the bisphenol A, all of it is covered.
[02:01:47.453 --> 02:01:55.559]  This is a very important video, one of the most powerful we've put out, and it's got a powerful title because they admit she's basically poisoned by this stuff.
[02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:57.261]  Lindsay Lohan poisons.
[02:01:57.301 --> 02:02:02.205]  We can take this media diversion and use it for good, and you better believe it,
[02:02:02.765 --> 02:02:05.748]  I saw listeners on the comment board and YouTube begging for it.
[02:02:06.128 --> 02:02:06.728]  We love you.
[02:02:06.908 --> 02:02:08.109]  This is an activist show.
[02:02:08.590 --> 02:02:09.330]  We're 18 for 18.
[02:02:09.831 --> 02:02:10.792]  You've never failed.
[02:02:11.272 --> 02:02:14.895]  Lindsay Lohan poisoned is the search term.
[02:02:15.375 --> 02:02:18.218]  And enter it this hour, next hour, do it tonight.
[02:02:18.498 --> 02:02:19.098]  Keep doing it.
[02:02:19.138 --> 02:02:20.660]  Let's keep it up there at number one.
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:22.201]  Lindsay Lohan.
[02:02:22.241 --> 02:02:24.042]  Lohan's L-O-H-A-N.
[02:02:24.523 --> 02:02:26.624]  Lindsay Lohan poisoned.
[02:02:26.945 --> 02:02:27.665]  Three words.
[02:02:28.085 --> 02:02:30.387]  Lindsay Lohan poisoned.
[02:02:30.688 --> 02:02:32.029]  Then a separate search term.
[02:02:33.234 --> 02:02:36.817]  A separate search term, because then they'll probably block that later.
[02:02:37.778 --> 02:02:46.085]  Three hundred million, so search the term three hundred million, but also search the term Lindsay Lohan poisoned.
[02:02:46.846 --> 02:02:54.713]  And these videos and these articles at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com will go to number one, and this video might get a million views instead of a half million the next week.
[02:02:55.033 --> 02:02:55.954]  This is exciting!
[02:02:56.454 --> 02:02:58.716]  This is culture jamming, this is InfoWars,
[02:03:00.339 --> 02:03:01.440]  Battles that are going on.
[02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:05.182]  Lindsay Lohan poisons one search term, 300 million is the second search term.
[02:03:05.763 --> 02:03:06.343]  It's up to you.
[02:03:06.363 --> 02:03:07.004]  You're awesome.
[02:03:07.284 --> 02:03:11.186]  In closing, Dan Dix, I want to thank you for making the film United We Fall.
[02:03:11.587 --> 02:03:13.688]  I want to salute you and the other filmmaker.
[02:03:13.708 --> 02:03:16.150]  I want to get Brian Long sometime with you.
[02:03:16.610 --> 02:03:18.172]  And I can't wait to see your new films.
[02:03:18.513 --> 02:03:21.858]  I hope folks will get it at InfoWars.com and get it out to everyone they know.
[02:03:21.878 --> 02:03:29.448]  And I want to thank you for allowing us to post it at PrisonPlanet.tv for our viewers there, so they can also share their passcode and give it to friends and family.
[02:03:29.488 --> 02:03:31.091]  But I really want to thank you, my friend.
[02:03:31.704 --> 02:03:35.925]  Well, thank you very much, Alex, and people, you know, like my work.
[02:03:35.965 --> 02:03:43.387]  I mean, over the years, I've put together a pretty solid team, namely Stephen Davies and Brian Locke, and together, I mean, the three of us make a good team.
[02:03:43.687 --> 02:03:45.367]  We put out a lot of YouTube videos.
[02:03:45.407 --> 02:03:46.727]  We cover a lot of the issues.
[02:03:46.807 --> 02:03:48.228]  We're making documentary films.
[02:03:48.728 --> 02:03:58.830]  So if people want to support us, you can go to my website, which is PressForTruth.ca, and the best thing to do there is donate, or you can purchase any one of our films.
[02:04:07.493 --> 02:04:08.093]  Absolutely.
[02:04:08.133 --> 02:04:10.673]  Well, I want to commend you, and I look forward to future work.
[02:04:11.594 --> 02:04:13.014]  This makes us all a lot safer.
[02:04:13.054 --> 02:04:28.379]  It makes myself safer, Ron Paul safer, and other really prominent patriots a lot safer, because they know that there are millions, not thousands, but millions of intelligent men and women out there, like yourself, who can do as good a job or even a better job than what I've done.
[02:04:29.019 --> 02:04:33.064]  Together, free humanity will win, thanks to your spirit of liberty.
[02:04:33.504 --> 02:04:35.346]  And I want to just close with Thomas Jefferson.
[02:04:35.406 --> 02:04:41.513]  I have sworn on the altar of God, eternal resistance against every form of tyranny over the mind of men.
[02:04:41.973 --> 02:04:44.636]  Dan Dix, with the film, United We Fall.
[02:04:44.917 --> 02:04:48.901]  You can get two copies and get three films free when you get it at Infowars.com.
[02:04:49.182 --> 02:04:50.183]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:04:52.609 --> 02:04:52.950]  Thank you.
[02:04:53.050 --> 02:04:54.112]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:04:54.533 --> 02:04:54.893]  Okay.
[02:04:55.194 --> 02:04:58.099]  Manny Modillo, Padillo, and Bob McIlvain.
[02:04:58.139 --> 02:04:58.680]  Straight ahead.
[02:04:58.740 --> 02:04:59.201]  Key info.
[02:05:01.343 --> 02:05:04.984]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:05.304 --> 02:05:13.445]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:14.165 --> 02:05:18.206]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:18.786 --> 02:05:29.608]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:30.248 --> 02:05:39.250]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:39.770 --> 02:05:44.791]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:45.192 --> 02:05:52.373]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:52.673 --> 02:05:55.434]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:05:59.175 --> 02:06:03.398]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:03.719 --> 02:06:04.339]  Number one.
[02:06:04.639 --> 02:06:07.782]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:08.062 --> 02:06:08.622]  Number two.
[02:06:08.923 --> 02:06:13.466]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:13.806 --> 02:06:14.267]  It's true.
[02:06:14.547 --> 02:06:19.130]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:19.431 --> 02:06:19.991]  Number three.
[02:06:20.251 --> 02:06:23.534]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:23.834 --> 02:06:27.537]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:27.737 --> 02:06:28.298]  Number 4.
[02:06:28.538 --> 02:06:30.900]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:31.301 --> 02:06:34.684]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:34.985 --> 02:06:35.185]  Number 5.
[02:06:35.765 --> 02:06:39.690]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:44.675]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:44.955 --> 02:06:48.980]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:49.141 --> 02:06:50.703]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:50.923 --> 02:06:53.006]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:06:55.789 --> 02:06:58.192]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[02:07:02.017 --> 02:07:05.539]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:07:05.819 --> 02:07:08.460]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:07:08.700 --> 02:07:13.723]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:14.063 --> 02:07:19.666]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.

[02:07:22.348 --> 02:07:25.349]  Not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[02:07:25.690 --> 02:07:27.491]  Try their new Evacuation Pack.
[02:07:27.651 --> 02:07:29.952]  A two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[02:07:30.213 --> 02:07:32.354]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it.
[02:07:32.614 --> 02:07:38.338]  With open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[02:07:38.698 --> 02:07:40.559]  Get yourself and your family ready today.

[02:07:51.124 --> 02:07:56.286]  Again on the web, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[02:07:56.406 --> 02:08:09.090]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:22.875 --> 02:08:45.081]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, and we now have seen in New York, almost nine years later, that the Congress is still blocking medical treatment for the firemen, the police, the emergency crews, the people that breathe, the asbestos, the aerosolized, pulverized concrete, and mercury that was several feet deep all over lower Manhattan.
[02:08:46.121 --> 02:08:49.202]  We saw the EPA say it's safe, no respirators needed.
[02:08:49.562 --> 02:08:50.283]  Now in the Gulf,
[02:08:52.071 --> 02:08:56.773]  Hundreds, a hundred plus days into this, they say Obama says no health problems, you don't need masks.
[02:08:57.233 --> 02:08:59.654]  Doctors are coming out saying people are dying, getting sick.
[02:09:00.594 --> 02:09:04.995]  Here is a report today from the French news agency AFP.
[02:09:05.436 --> 02:09:09.657]  Study, oil spill cleanup workers suffering chromosome damage, respiratory illness.
[02:09:09.997 --> 02:09:11.738]  What do you think Corexit does?
[02:09:12.478 --> 02:09:17.302]  They used it and other similar dispersants that are extremely toxic in Exxon Valdez.
[02:09:17.323 --> 02:09:22.667]  The average life expectancy is 51, not 75, for Exxon Valdez workers.
[02:09:22.968 --> 02:09:24.329]  So they live less than 20 years.
[02:09:25.150 --> 02:09:26.591]  They get 20 years cut off their life.
[02:09:27.232 --> 02:09:28.873]  And this just dissolves DNA.
[02:09:29.153 --> 02:09:30.815]  And they've used 40 plus million gallons.
[02:09:30.835 --> 02:09:31.716]  They're still using it.
[02:09:32.216 --> 02:09:34.678]  They're shooting it from aircraft spraying it at night.
[02:09:35.580 --> 02:09:38.024]  And it just shows what the globalists think of you.
[02:09:38.065 --> 02:09:40.149]  It's just like all the major studies about D.U.
[02:09:40.509 --> 02:09:46.221]  killing the troops, causing a 12-fold, excuse me, I'm sorry, pull up that London Independent article, I think it's 14-fold
[02:09:48.902 --> 02:09:51.604]  No, it's 12-fold increase in children, that's right.
[02:09:51.924 --> 02:09:57.608]  Four-fold increase in the studies in adults of cancers, deformities, you name it.
[02:09:57.688 --> 02:10:01.590]  They know in their own army studies what it did before they decided to use it.
[02:10:01.871 --> 02:10:08.615]  They don't care about the cops, the troops, the citizens, and you bet they engineered 9-11, this global corporate crime syndicate.
[02:10:09.015 --> 02:10:17.121]  All the evidence is clear, and I've been saying it before 9-11, and since then, the Gulf of Tonkin is now declassified to be staged, Operation Ajax.
[02:10:17.561 --> 02:10:18.482]  I had a high-level
[02:10:19.842 --> 02:10:20.203]  I don't
[02:10:36.710 --> 02:10:55.931]  About the tens of thousands of rescue workers dead and dying, over 3,000 dead now, if they don't care about the tens of thousands of cleanup crews and lie to them and say, you're fine, the EPA says you're fine, Obama says you're fine, then we have the footage of Building 7 being blown up, the police saying get back, they say they're blowing it up, the newscast where they said it, and they've tried to ignore this.
[02:10:56.451 --> 02:11:02.375]  But there's a new TV ad, and they got some great funding from great patriots, that's going to run around the country this weekend.
[02:11:02.415 --> 02:11:04.817]  It's going to premiere here in just a few minutes.
[02:11:05.477 --> 02:11:07.799]  And it's such important information.
[02:11:08.199 --> 02:11:12.643]  Now, Manny Bedillo, of course, lost his uncle in the World Trade Center.
[02:11:12.683 --> 02:11:14.184]  Bob McElvain lost his son.
[02:11:14.784 --> 02:11:37.330]  And they've both been outspoken patriots, really shattering the lie that is the official 9-11 fable that's been used to butcher the Bill of Rights and Constitution, to sell secret arrested torture, to sell illegal wars, to sell the naked body scanners, to sell this conversion from land of the free, home of the brave, to land of the slaves and brainwashed minions.
[02:11:38.050 --> 02:11:46.619]  So, we now go to Manny Badillo and Bob McIlvain joining us, and I'm glad they contacted me to premiere this here today.
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:48.021]  Gentlemen, good to have you on.
[02:11:48.041 --> 02:11:51.485]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:11:52.186 --> 02:11:56.030]  Who wants to speak first about this ad, why it's important, and then we're going to premiere it.
[02:11:57.131 --> 02:11:57.651]  Go ahead, Manny.
[02:11:58.372 --> 02:11:58.853]  Thanks, Bob.
[02:11:59.631 --> 02:12:02.313]  Okay, Alex, this is breaking.
[02:12:02.353 --> 02:12:03.994]  We're going to compete with the big boys now.
[02:12:04.974 --> 02:12:08.517]  For the past year in New York, there's been the Building What campaign.
[02:12:09.037 --> 02:12:14.040]  And essentially, that started from last year during NYC Cans.
[02:12:16.574 --> 02:12:19.516]  Petition Drive, where we collected 80,000 signatures.
[02:12:19.596 --> 02:12:22.219]  We've made it all the way to the State Supreme Court.
[02:12:22.679 --> 02:12:27.764]  And in the arguments at the State Supreme Court, of course, the city was trying to fight against us.
[02:12:27.884 --> 02:12:31.988]  The city law office came out and said it's not a proper subject to be placed in front of the voters.
[02:12:32.409 --> 02:12:33.550]  I mean, that's shocking enough.
[02:12:33.910 --> 02:12:39.035]  But in the courtroom, when the arguments were going back and forth between our lawyer, Dennis McMahon,
[02:12:39.619 --> 02:12:39.919]  I don't know.
[02:12:52.410 --> 02:12:59.055]  Uh, we have never had a real investigation because the 9-11 Commission did not answer the majority of families' questions.
[02:12:59.535 --> 02:13:02.517]  And there's some outstanding questions, such as, what happened to Building 7?
[02:13:03.498 --> 02:13:10.102]  Well, Judge Lerner replied in the courtroom, and this is, you could read this, he replied, Building what?
[02:13:11.223 --> 02:13:18.288]  And ultimately, that shows that even a New York City judge had no idea about Building 7.
[02:13:19.332 --> 02:13:25.676]  And this is the pivotal point in the entire event that took my uncle's life.
[02:13:26.317 --> 02:13:34.342]  This film, this video we have, and there's multiple videos of Building 7 coming down, if that's shown to the world,
[02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:37.771]  Then people are going to become skeptical.
[02:13:37.791 --> 02:13:39.873]  They're going to start critically thinking about the event.
[02:13:40.133 --> 02:13:41.494]  Yeah, Building 7 is the key.
[02:13:41.514 --> 02:13:43.355]  And again, we're talking to Manny Badillo.
[02:13:43.616 --> 02:13:44.937]  I get all wound up knowing him for years.
[02:13:44.977 --> 02:13:46.037]  Great guy, Colin Badillo.
[02:13:46.318 --> 02:13:48.619]  Manny Badillo and Bob McIlvain.
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:52.683]  This is so important because for those that don't know, why don't you recap
[02:13:53.223 --> 02:13:53.383]  I don't
[02:14:13.052 --> 02:14:19.918]  CNN reported it, and we have multiple mainstream live feeds, CNN and others, saying, get back.
[02:14:20.218 --> 02:14:21.639]  They've decided to bring it down.
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:27.504]  Then we have the owners saying, we made the decision to pull the building, gave the order, watch it come down.
[02:14:27.584 --> 02:14:30.567]  Pull it means controlled demolition in that nomenclature.
[02:14:31.227 --> 02:14:35.311]  You know, just like a touchdown is called a TD in football.
[02:14:35.791 --> 02:14:36.452]  Speak about that.
[02:14:37.130 --> 02:14:38.150]  We have eyewitnesses.
[02:14:38.231 --> 02:14:39.971]  Craig Bartmer heard the explosion.
[02:14:40.712 --> 02:14:41.392]  NYPD.
[02:14:41.452 --> 02:14:45.094]  We have Kevin McPadden, who heard the countdown for the building.
[02:14:46.274 --> 02:14:50.036]  Building 7, we are changed every Saturday.
[02:14:50.176 --> 02:14:52.117]  Stands on the ground where Building 7 is.
[02:14:52.957 --> 02:14:54.799]  Uh, the old Building 7 used to stand.
[02:14:54.919 --> 02:14:56.601]  There's already a new building there.
[02:14:56.981 --> 02:15:03.428]  Okay, they already have built a new Building 7, and yet there's still no proper family memorial.
[02:15:03.448 --> 02:15:12.617]  There's a retail store up the block that sells memorabilia, but there's still no proper memorial, yet the majority of Americans do not know about the Solomon Brothers Building.
[02:15:12.677 --> 02:15:14.038]  That was the name of the building.
[02:15:14.358 --> 02:15:19.382]  And it's where the CIA and FBI and everybody else was based and the city, state and county command center.
[02:15:19.402 --> 02:15:22.504]  Let's get Bob McElveen who lost his son's take on this.
[02:15:43.695 --> 02:15:49.637]  Well, Alex, you know, like Manny and Ted Walters, they've been doing so much work on this.
[02:15:51.658 --> 02:16:01.342]  I personally, since this all began, and you know, any parent, I don't know if you know anyone that's lost a child, but my whole investigation, of course, is what happened that day.
[02:16:01.962 --> 02:16:05.484]  And I personally feel that, you know, the United States orchestrated this whole event.
[02:16:06.404 --> 02:16:11.546]  But what's so important about Building 7, and I think the other two buildings have to be talked about also, because
[02:16:12.159 --> 02:16:13.980]  My son didn't work at the tower.
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:16.721]  He was supposed to be up on the 6th floor.
[02:16:17.261 --> 02:16:24.564]  But anyway, I've spent years investigating, and every parent wants to know, did your child go through any pain?
[02:16:25.745 --> 02:16:38.350]  And I finally was able to sit down with the doctor, who found his body, or looked at his body, and he was brought into the morgue that day.
[02:16:39.266 --> 02:17:04.583]  So, you know, it took me years to finally find a doctor, but why I'm so connected to Building 7 and the other buildings is I found out my son walked into the lobby of Tower 1, could have been before the plane hit or right at the plane, but he died instantly, and it was like a big shotgun blast to him, and to the chest and the face, and there were
[02:17:06.665 --> 02:17:13.071]  And people's skeptics will say, well, it's because the fire came down the lobby and it blew out, but he had his post-mortem burned.
[02:17:13.982 --> 02:17:16.445]  So there was a huge explosion in the lobby.
[02:17:16.485 --> 02:17:17.926]  It wasn't caused by fire.
[02:17:18.507 --> 02:17:20.188]  So he died from an explosion.
[02:17:20.349 --> 02:17:29.558]  And when you hear about the explosions going on in Tower 7, the explosions in the South Tower, the explosions in the North Tower, and of course the Commission never spoke of that.
[02:17:29.738 --> 02:17:37.066]  And we've got firemen and police and janitors and witnesses about boom boom bombs going off everywhere.
[02:17:37.691 --> 02:17:38.031]  Correct.
[02:17:38.111 --> 02:17:41.093]  And I can prove beyond a reasonable... This is how my son died.
[02:17:41.153 --> 02:17:42.094]  So he was murdered.
[02:17:42.574 --> 02:17:45.236]  And it wasn't because of the plane hitting the North.
[02:17:45.276 --> 02:17:46.837]  He was walking into the North Tower.
[02:17:47.457 --> 02:17:48.698]  It wasn't because of fire.
[02:17:48.718 --> 02:17:50.299]  It wasn't because the building came down.
[02:17:50.339 --> 02:17:51.820]  Because he would have called me.
[02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:52.901]  He died instantly.
[02:17:52.921 --> 02:17:56.183]  He might have died right before the plane hit or right after the plane hit.
[02:17:56.223 --> 02:17:58.905]  Because all his injuries were to his face and chest.
[02:17:59.385 --> 02:18:00.366]  So he didn't know what hit him.
[02:18:00.666 --> 02:18:01.266]  He didn't run.
[02:18:01.306 --> 02:18:03.147]  If the plane would have hit, he would have run.
[02:18:03.508 --> 02:18:05.309]  So he definitely died from an explosion.
[02:18:05.329 --> 02:18:06.670]  So this is why it's so important to me.
[02:18:07.759 --> 02:18:10.702]  I want closure on how my son was killed or murdered.
[02:18:11.743 --> 02:18:20.210]  And I've been lying to you since 2000, September 11, 2001, when they had the story orchestrated for us.
[02:18:20.991 --> 02:18:22.212]  And this is what I'll tell you.
[02:18:22.232 --> 02:18:27.517]  So this is why the building 7, but the other two buildings are very important because it's these explosions.
[02:18:27.977 --> 02:18:29.538]  Where did these explosions come from?
[02:18:29.578 --> 02:18:31.140]  Well, they didn't come from the fire.
[02:18:32.046 --> 02:18:36.049]  Specifically in the South Tower, how the plane hits the corner of the building.
[02:18:36.389 --> 02:18:37.950]  Most of the explosion's outside.
[02:18:38.250 --> 02:18:40.212]  And that tower comes down before the North Tower?
[02:18:40.232 --> 02:18:41.233]  Well, that's impossible.
[02:18:41.373 --> 02:18:52.100]  Well, we also have the firemen on video saying the fires were almost out in the North and South Tower, but that there was like molten lava, like a foundry, like a volcano, and jet fuel can't do that.
[02:18:52.461 --> 02:18:55.002]  It can weaken steel, but it can't turn it into lava.
[02:18:55.202 --> 02:18:55.963]  It's impossible.
[02:18:56.523 --> 02:18:58.645]  I mean, we're talking about impossibility.
[02:18:59.145 --> 02:19:01.427]  And then, of course, Tower 7, it wasn't hit.
[02:19:02.327 --> 02:19:11.472]  So, all these things, and it's just, you know, finally we're, you know, hopefully getting somewhere that people in New York City, and it's important people in New York City, that these things were impossible.
[02:19:12.673 --> 02:19:15.034]  That they could possibly happen like they did.
[02:19:15.074 --> 02:19:23.319]  So, it's, um... What do you think of Glenn Beck saying he hates the victims' families and that they're... I, you know, I, I really, I don't even want to talk about Glenn Beck.
[02:19:23.359 --> 02:19:24.860]  I don't want to talk about anybody on TV.
[02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:25.620]  He's an idiot.
[02:19:25.980 --> 02:19:27.161]  He's, he's there to make money.
[02:19:27.944 --> 02:19:28.504]  He's a clown.
[02:19:28.524 --> 02:19:29.485]  I would put it to him.
[02:19:29.545 --> 02:19:30.225]  I'd put it to anyone.
[02:19:30.245 --> 02:19:32.426]  I wish you could say that in front of my face.
[02:19:32.466 --> 02:19:33.766]  Come to my door and say that.
[02:19:45.816 --> 02:19:53.607]  Yeah, I just thought I'd bring up that sickening hypocrisy and they won't give the heroes medical care.
[02:19:53.627 --> 02:19:57.833]  They just want to wrap themselves in the American flag and their heroism.
[02:19:57.873 --> 02:19:58.413]  Stay there, sir.
[02:19:59.929 --> 02:20:02.952]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:20:03.313 --> 02:20:06.937]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:20:07.217 --> 02:20:10.681]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:20:10.941 --> 02:20:18.490]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:18.790]  I think so.
[02:20:33.541 --> 02:20:33.941]  We're good.
[02:20:59.878 --> 02:21:04.742]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:21:04.842 --> 02:21:05.622]  What have we got?
[02:21:05.842 --> 02:21:07.964]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:21:08.284 --> 02:21:09.025]  A republic.
[02:21:09.285 --> 02:21:11.887]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:21:11.947 --> 02:21:13.848]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:21:14.209 --> 02:21:16.110]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:17.511]  So they think they own our land?
[02:21:17.911 --> 02:21:19.032]  They think they own our water?
[02:21:19.232 --> 02:21:19.633]  Children?
[02:21:19.833 --> 02:21:20.633]  Our education?
[02:21:20.974 --> 02:21:21.594]  Our money?
[02:21:21.794 --> 02:21:25.437]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:21:25.797 --> 02:21:29.462]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:21:29.502 --> 02:21:30.464]  You have been warned!
[02:21:30.764 --> 02:21:31.605]  We have the facts.
[02:21:31.805 --> 02:21:32.927]  We have the Constitution.
[02:21:32.967 --> 02:21:33.848]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:21:33.868 --> 02:21:34.709]  We have common law.
[02:21:34.749 --> 02:21:37.012]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:37.293 --> 02:21:41.058]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:21:41.158 --> 02:21:45.943]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:21:46.123 --> 02:21:47.504]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:21:47.624 --> 02:21:48.445]  Don't tread on me.
[02:21:48.705 --> 02:21:59.216]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:22:01.958 --> 02:22:03.079]  This is not a drill.
[02:22:03.159 --> 02:22:05.101]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:22:07.552 --> 02:22:14.677]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:22:14.777 --> 02:22:19.140]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:22:19.180 --> 02:22:21.722]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques.
[02:22:21.802 --> 02:22:24.584]  Where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them.
[02:22:24.624 --> 02:22:25.725]  How to create the perfect
[02:22:25.745 --> 02:22:26.185]  We're good to go.
[02:22:53.882 --> 02:22:54.764]  For your guns!
[02:22:55.005 --> 02:22:57.250]  HideYourGuns.com right now!
[02:22:59.821 --> 02:23:00.281]  Attention!
[02:23:00.421 --> 02:23:05.303]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[02:23:05.423 --> 02:23:10.945]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[02:23:11.105 --> 02:23:18.047]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[02:23:18.248 --> 02:23:26.991]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[02:23:28.211 --> 02:23:30.532]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[02:23:31.352 --> 02:23:37.995]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[02:23:38.195 --> 02:23:46.998]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[02:23:47.138 --> 02:23:51.760]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:51.960]  800-902-6969.
[02:23:51.980 --> 02:23:52.020]  800-902-6969.
[02:23:52.060 --> 02:23:52.320]  Again, 800-902-6969.
[02:23:52.340 --> 02:23:54.301]  Yeah, I'm sorry for even bringing up Glenn Beck.
[02:23:54.361 --> 02:23:55.981]  I don't even like to bash the guy.
[02:23:56.141 --> 02:24:12.287]  It's just there's all these audio tapes on the radio going, there's nobody I hate more than 9-11 victims' families.
[02:24:19.429 --> 02:24:21.110]  Always whining, complaining.
[02:24:21.550 --> 02:24:29.714]  And then I saw New York Post saying, oh, it's ambulance chasers that want medical care, when all the hospitals say they're dead and dying and full of asbestos.
[02:24:29.734 --> 02:24:32.475]  I mean, they're now going to do that to the people with the core exit.
[02:24:32.495 --> 02:24:33.695]  But that's another issue.
[02:24:33.715 --> 02:24:40.478]  We need to explain the attacks, or they'll keep using the attacks to get more power, and they may stage more attacks.
[02:24:40.518 --> 02:24:41.499]  So I want to play
[02:24:42.479 --> 02:24:43.340]  I lost my son.
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:43.580]  My nephew.
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:43.721]  My son.
[02:24:43.741 --> 02:24:44.101]  On September 11th, 2001.
[02:24:44.141 --> 02:24:46.723]  Most people don't know that a third tower fell on September 11th.
[02:24:59.795 --> 02:25:03.738]  Trade Center 7, a 47-story skyscraper, was not hit by a plane.
[02:25:03.758 --> 02:25:13.367]  Although the official explanation is that fire brought down Building 7, over 1,200 architects and engineers have looked into the evidence and believe there is more to the story.
[02:25:13.387 --> 02:25:18.711]  Bring justice to my son, my uncle, my nephew, my son, and thousands of others who died on September 11.
[02:25:18.911 --> 02:25:20.813]  Go to buildingwhat.org.
[02:25:22.054 --> 02:25:30.961]  Buildingwhat.org, but I think it is actually, maybe I should retract my apology, I just don't like to hurt people's feelings, to point out that the victims' families are being demonized.
[02:25:32.683 --> 02:25:34.404]  Manny Baddio, you want to talk about that?
[02:25:35.505 --> 02:25:40.609]  Yeah, it's completely, it's awful how we're being treated in the media.
[02:25:40.649 --> 02:25:48.756]  We're not only being demonized by the likes of those shills that are on corporate TV, you know, we're being
[02:25:49.759 --> 02:25:53.622]  In the city of New York, like I said, we still don't have a memorial.
[02:25:53.662 --> 02:26:03.191]  We're being used as pawns in the latest propaganda game that they're putting out there, this community center issue in downtown Manhattan.
[02:26:03.231 --> 02:26:06.133]  They're pitching us one against the other.
[02:26:06.473 --> 02:26:09.596]  They're causing this disturbance to ferment fear and hatred.
[02:26:10.937 --> 02:26:18.343]  You know, throughout the country, based on the lies that we were told, my uncle was murdered close to nine years ago.
[02:26:18.443 --> 02:26:20.344]  My family has never been the same.
[02:26:20.785 --> 02:26:23.307]  I lost both my grandparents shortly thereafter.
[02:26:23.747 --> 02:26:35.696]  And I'm going to tell you, we need this information to get into the hands and for the majority of people in this country to realize that there is a huge component to the event that we don't know about.
[02:26:35.936 --> 02:26:44.721]  Even down at Ground Zero, the little tiny, you know, memorials that they have there, they don't even show Building 7 as part of the original complex.
[02:26:44.781 --> 02:26:46.102]  I mean, this is propaganda.
[02:26:46.502 --> 02:26:48.263]  It's unbelievable.
[02:26:48.903 --> 02:27:02.630]  Well, that's why I raised the point is that they're grandstanding down there for more wars and all this, using the attacks while blocking aid to the families and to the emergency workers, while demonizing the emergency workers.
[02:27:03.011 --> 02:27:05.232]  I mean, Bob, the reason I raise this is it just shows
[02:27:05.652 --> 02:27:07.013]  How sick these people are!
[02:27:08.194 --> 02:27:11.397]  Well, again, I could care less, to tell you the truth.
[02:27:11.817 --> 02:27:13.038]  I mean, just for me.
[02:27:13.118 --> 02:27:16.941]  I feel bad for family members that want to speak, you know, to the truth.
[02:27:17.782 --> 02:27:19.904]  But, you know, I've given up.
[02:27:20.504 --> 02:27:24.748]  I've asked many of these people to come back and rally, you know, to have me on the show.
[02:27:25.308 --> 02:27:33.355]  You know, I wish, I just wish any human being could prove to me that I'm wrong so I can move on with my life, but I can't move on with my life.
[02:27:34.051 --> 02:27:38.532]  So I have one job in life right now, of course, to take care of my grandchildren.
[02:27:38.552 --> 02:27:42.314]  I have grandchildren now, but it's to prove how my son was murdered.
[02:27:42.714 --> 02:27:43.734]  And I have done that.
[02:27:44.194 --> 02:27:48.035]  I might die tomorrow, you know, when we talk about new investigation.
[02:27:48.055 --> 02:27:49.556]  Well, I can't care about new investigation.
[02:27:49.596 --> 02:27:50.056]  I've won it.
[02:27:50.396 --> 02:27:52.377]  I wish it could happen tomorrow, but I could be dead tomorrow.
[02:27:52.937 --> 02:27:58.079]  So it's so important, you know, great people like you to invite me on the show that I can at least express my views.
[02:27:59.779 --> 02:28:03.741]  People 100 years from now will know that this is what I had said.
[02:28:04.161 --> 02:28:05.161]  And that's so important to me.
[02:28:05.181 --> 02:28:08.142]  That's why I just can't get involved in that insanity.
[02:28:08.182 --> 02:28:08.903]  No, I understand.
[02:28:08.963 --> 02:28:15.926]  It just shows how low they are to demonize the emergency workers and support the Republican Party.
[02:28:16.026 --> 02:28:17.026]  That's who's mainly doing it.
[02:28:17.366 --> 02:28:23.829]  Blocking aid, but some Democrats as well, for the emergency workers and then calling them ambulance chasers.
[02:28:24.309 --> 02:28:33.038]  And then the families aren't asking for anything but a new investigation, and they call you scum when you lost... I mean, it's just... It's over the top!
[02:28:33.058 --> 02:28:36.301]  I can't believe how... Well, Alex, governments are like that.
[02:28:36.321 --> 02:28:37.622]  I mean, blame the government.
[02:28:37.862 --> 02:28:41.666]  It's constantly creating a strategy of tension, and that's worldwide.
[02:28:42.299 --> 02:28:46.222]  And then it stops people from focusing on what should be focused on.
[02:28:46.723 --> 02:28:49.305]  It's what the whole mosque is all about, or the community center.
[02:28:49.685 --> 02:28:50.726]  Everything's about that.
[02:28:50.766 --> 02:28:52.287]  We have all these issues.
[02:28:52.547 --> 02:28:55.009]  That's why I hate to get involved in that issue.
[02:28:55.490 --> 02:29:02.455]  Okay, so tell us where the ad's going to be airing, and also people can donate on the site to get the ad to air more places.
[02:29:03.316 --> 02:29:05.798]  Well, it's going to go to New York City.
[02:29:06.258 --> 02:29:10.482]  You know, of course, that's the place it's going because we have talked to
[02:29:11.221 --> 02:29:11.602]  I don't know.
[02:29:26.101 --> 02:29:27.161]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.803 --> 02:29:56.488]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.355 --> 02:30:04.217]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:30:04.338 --> 02:30:05.098]  What have we got?
[02:30:05.318 --> 02:30:07.439]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:30:07.759 --> 02:30:08.480]  A republic.
[02:30:08.760 --> 02:30:11.361]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:30:11.421 --> 02:30:13.322]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:30:13.682 --> 02:30:15.583]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:30:15.703 --> 02:30:16.984]  So they think they own our land?
[02:30:17.384 --> 02:30:18.505]  They think they own our water?
[02:30:18.705 --> 02:30:19.105]  Children?
[02:30:19.305 --> 02:30:20.085]  Our education?
[02:30:20.426 --> 02:30:21.046]  Our money?
[02:30:21.266 --> 02:30:24.908]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:30:25.268 --> 02:30:29.934]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:30:30.254 --> 02:30:31.075]  We have the facts.
[02:30:31.275 --> 02:30:32.376]  We have the Constitution.
[02:30:32.436 --> 02:30:33.318]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:30:33.338 --> 02:30:34.179]  We have common law.
[02:30:34.239 --> 02:30:36.481]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:36.762 --> 02:30:40.526]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.

[02:33:00.762 --> 02:33:06.316]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:33:06.798 --> 02:33:09.344]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:13.072 --> 02:33:18.897]  Bob McElveen who lost his son on 9-11, and of course, Manny Medeo who lost his uncle are with us.
[02:33:19.778 --> 02:33:29.666]  And together with other great New Yorkers and victims' family members, they've launched buildingwhat.org, and they're going to have the TV ads running in New York and worldwide on the Internet.
[02:33:29.746 --> 02:33:31.668]  Get the video, get it out to everyone you know.
[02:33:31.688 --> 02:33:38.734]  If you can donate, donate, because resistance is victory, and more and more people are learning about Building 7.
[02:33:38.894 --> 02:33:40.995]  And I believe it's the key to folks
[02:33:41.776 --> 02:33:45.139]  Then finding out about all the other evidence of inside job.
[02:33:46.040 --> 02:33:50.345]  In closing, Bob McIlvain, Manny Baddio, closing comments from both of you.
[02:33:50.605 --> 02:33:51.766]  You've each got about four minutes.
[02:33:53.267 --> 02:33:56.651]  Bobby, I want you to end it.
[02:33:57.251 --> 02:33:57.832]  Very simply.
[02:33:58.487 --> 02:34:01.350]  The truth saves lives, okay?
[02:34:01.751 --> 02:34:08.599]  Once we get to the bottom of what took down that building, we're going to be able to get to the bottom of what's in all the first responders' lungs that are killing them.
[02:34:09.019 --> 02:34:16.088]  And science has already proven that there's nanothermetic material in all samples of the debris that's been tested independently.
[02:34:16.628 --> 02:34:21.772]  This building lot campaign is uniting a range of different groups.
[02:34:21.812 --> 02:34:29.998]  We're talking architects and engineers, political leaders for 9-11 Truth, firefighters for 9-11 Truth, NYC Cam lawyers for 9-11 Truth.
[02:34:30.259 --> 02:34:39.706]  We have a lot of different groups that are coming together to get the word out in order to save lives, change public perception, and get to the bottom of the murder of
[02:34:40.407 --> 02:34:43.714]  Of Uncle Tom, of Bobby, and three thousand others.
[02:34:44.275 --> 02:34:46.299]  And it's vitally important that we do this.
[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:49.105]  This is a campaign that was started last year.
[02:34:49.466 --> 02:34:51.390]  Bob spoke with city council.
[02:34:52.839 --> 02:35:06.308]  Then we did a fax and email writing call campaign, not only to City Council, but to the District Attorney of Manhattan, and now we're informing the people of New York, starting here in New York, and then we're going to move on to other cities.
[02:35:07.388 --> 02:35:13.612]  We've raised, and the website doesn't reflect this yet, close to $24,000 already, and it's about $750 on average to reach about 10,000 viewers.
[02:35:13.632 --> 02:35:15.153]  We want to reach millions of viewers.
[02:35:20.616 --> 02:35:25.900]  Once people see this, it's going to change perception, people will critically think and have more of an open mind.
[02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:34.526]  And once we get to the bottom, once we get the people going on this, and get to the bottom of the murder, we can then save countless lives.
[02:35:34.826 --> 02:35:37.128]  Well said, Bob McIlvain.
[02:35:37.168 --> 02:35:38.168]  Your closing thoughts?
[02:35:38.749 --> 02:35:41.411]  Well, I mean, you're the first one I heard to say, knowledge is power.
[02:35:41.791 --> 02:35:47.755]  And Bobby always had a poster, you know, hanging up on his wall, which said, knowledge is power.
[02:35:48.928 --> 02:35:50.049]  And that's so important.
[02:35:50.069 --> 02:35:55.915]  You know, if you have any new listeners at all, I mean, just think of yourself as a parent and your son was murdered.
[02:35:55.935 --> 02:35:56.935]  Your daughter was murdered.
[02:35:58.036 --> 02:35:59.318]  And nothing happened.
[02:35:59.698 --> 02:36:01.199]  You never had an investigation.
[02:36:01.600 --> 02:36:10.268]  I mean, even the commissioners agreed that there was not an investigation, that the investigation was a sham, that the investigation was set up to fail.
[02:36:10.948 --> 02:36:13.731]  Now, what are you supposed to think as a parent?
[02:36:14.557 --> 02:36:18.945]  Well, the only thing I can do is I have to carry out my own investigation.
[02:36:19.225 --> 02:36:22.170]  And I've been doing this every day of my life since 2001.
[02:36:22.351 --> 02:36:24.234]  I went to 95% of the commission hearings.
[02:36:27.099 --> 02:36:31.502]  To listen to General Meyers say that we're looking outwards.
[02:36:32.203 --> 02:36:38.908]  There's another possibility that four planes flew around for two hours and we did nothing to intercept them.
[02:36:38.988 --> 02:36:44.913]  That's the only conclusion I can come to, is that the government had to be involved in this.
[02:36:45.573 --> 02:36:48.235]  And that's where knowledge is power comes in.
[02:36:48.976 --> 02:36:53.139]  So many people, and I don't blame family members because it is so difficult to look at.
[02:36:53.959 --> 02:36:58.521]  Because they don't want to know exactly how their son or daughter died or their sister or brother.
[02:36:59.381 --> 02:37:00.701]  But I've done my legwork.
[02:37:00.962 --> 02:37:08.044]  You know, but because I'm not a TV personality or I'm not a politician, people think, well, I've been told I'm being emotional about it.
[02:37:08.504 --> 02:37:18.668]  But as I said before, I wish, I truly, truly wish someone anywhere could come and sit down and talk to me and say, I am 100% wrong and prove to me that I am wrong.
[02:37:19.309 --> 02:37:21.049]  Again, my life would be so much better.
[02:37:21.309 --> 02:37:21.950]  But they can't.
[02:37:22.030 --> 02:37:23.330]  That's why I won't be on TV.
[02:37:23.390 --> 02:37:24.590]  No one wants to talk about it.
[02:37:24.810 --> 02:37:27.631]  The only thing they can do on TV and in the media is call you names.
[02:37:27.971 --> 02:37:29.151]  That's the best they can do.
[02:37:30.131 --> 02:37:36.852]  So, this, what's happening in New York City, the fact that we'll be here, the people, it just doesn't get into the media.
[02:37:37.312 --> 02:37:40.013]  People in my support group still don't know about Tower 7.
[02:37:40.693 --> 02:37:42.173]  No one knows about Tower 7.
[02:37:42.233 --> 02:37:44.894]  So I'm worried that we'll light a light in their minds
[02:37:45.854 --> 02:37:49.680]  But also, they will seek out the knowledge, because knowledge is truly power.
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:50.301]  It is.
[02:37:50.502 --> 02:37:52.925]  And it's the only way this can happen.
[02:37:52.945 --> 02:37:56.131]  And the more we put it out there, the more knowledge people will find.
[02:37:56.550 --> 02:37:58.311]  Buildingwhat.org.
[02:37:58.431 --> 02:38:01.493]  Go there, get the ad, give it to everyone you know, email it out, donate.
[02:38:01.533 --> 02:38:02.593]  Buildingwhat.org.
[02:38:02.633 --> 02:38:04.514]  Bob McElveen, Manny Medeo.
[02:38:04.574 --> 02:38:12.278]  God bless you both, and we look forward to talking to you in the near future to track the success of this operation you're running.
[02:38:12.338 --> 02:38:13.899]  For truth, knowledge is power.
[02:38:14.179 --> 02:38:14.959]  God bless you both.
[02:38:15.279 --> 02:38:15.680]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:38:15.700 --> 02:38:16.140]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:38:16.741 --> 02:38:21.703]  Great Americans standing up for truth and justice and we're not going to stop.
[02:38:21.723 --> 02:38:29.966]  You know, we had what Bill Doyle on a few years ago, the head of the biggest victims family group, and he said more than half the members believe the government carried out the attacks and that he believes it as well.
[02:38:30.706 --> 02:38:32.626]  So we've got to get that news out to people.
[02:38:32.687 --> 02:38:33.787]  Now, shifting gears.
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:50.007]  Everybody else in this country and worldwide now where the globalists are in control of their soft kill eugenics operation is under attack with the bisphenol A, the mercury, the vaccines, the GMO foods, all of it, the fluoride in the water.
[02:38:50.587 --> 02:38:58.911]  And I am trying to culture jam, we're going to put it up on screen, using one of their favorite search terms and favorite diversions, Lindsay Lohan.
[02:39:00.150 --> 02:39:08.059]  And a bunch of doctors that even work with the government have come out and admitted, look, her shrinks put her on a bunch of psychotropics and Adderall speed.
[02:39:08.579 --> 02:39:10.301]  This is what should make her act so crazy.
[02:39:10.361 --> 02:39:11.683]  She's got to get off this stuff.
[02:39:12.263 --> 02:39:15.206]  And I've broken it all down in this 11-minute video.
[02:39:15.507 --> 02:39:18.890]  We'll come back in the final segment and cover other key news in the shower.
[02:39:19.311 --> 02:39:21.173]  But Lindsey Lohan poisoned
[02:39:21.733 --> 02:39:27.015]  is the search term today, so this video and the story that accompanies it will be number one.
[02:39:27.375 --> 02:39:33.818]  Please search the term, Lindsay Lohan poisoned, and we'll reach a lot of zombies that don't know what's happening.
[02:39:34.458 --> 02:39:35.439]  Lindsay Lohan poisoned.
[02:39:37.802 --> 02:39:39.064]  I know what you're thinking.
[02:39:39.304 --> 02:39:41.847]  Why is Alex Jones talking about Lindsay Lohan?
[02:39:42.648 --> 02:39:43.709]  I'll be quite honest with you.
[02:39:44.650 --> 02:39:51.879]  If I can get you to pay attention to this key information I'm about to cover by mentioning Lindsay Lohan, I'll do it.
[02:39:52.847 --> 02:40:19.894]  Because Lindsay Lohan is just another individual on this planet, like everybody else, and a lot of top doctors have come out and said, look, we have interviewed her, and we've done medical exams, and she shouldn't have been on Adderall, which is basically a form of methamphetamine, and this can cause the same effects in people that cocaine and methamphetamine does, and that several doctors believe that this is why she's been so out of control.
[02:40:20.434 --> 02:40:21.294]  Well, no kidding!
[02:40:22.074 --> 02:40:29.958]  School children in this country, millions of them, are put on Adderall and other amphetamine-type drugs like Ritalin.
[02:40:30.618 --> 02:40:37.421]  And in the inserts for the drug, it says it can cause brain shrinkage, heart expansion, all sorts of serious
[02:40:38.101 --> 02:40:38.841]  Health problems.
[02:40:39.402 --> 02:40:45.144]  When I was in junior high, one of the kids on the football team died of a heart attack and the doctor said it was the Ritalin.
[02:40:45.604 --> 02:40:47.925]  I mean, this is an ongoing nightmare.
[02:40:48.305 --> 02:40:49.325]  Look at these drugs.
[02:40:49.726 --> 02:40:55.508]  New reports have come out that over 80% of the drugs, the new drugs they're selling, prescription drugs,
[02:40:56.808 --> 02:41:01.473]  A, don't treat what they claim they're treating, and B, have toxic side effects.
[02:41:01.493 --> 02:41:05.957]  I mean, you've all seen the drug ads on TV, where they'll say, having trouble urinating every few hours?
[02:41:06.257 --> 02:41:12.883]  Take this drug, but it, you know, may- Also increase the chance of serious skin reactions or stomach and intestine problems.
[02:41:12.903 --> 02:41:17.668]  Dry mouth, insomnia, sexual side effects, diarrhea, nausea, and sleepiness.
[02:41:17.928 --> 02:41:18.989]  Muscle pain or weakness.
[02:41:19.049 --> 02:41:21.792]  Unusual changes in mood or behavior, or thoughts of suicide.
[02:41:22.708 --> 02:41:39.255]  But if you look at the mass shootings and every time I see a case of a mother who chops her toddler's arms and legs off or straps their four kids in their car and drives it off a cliff into a lake and drowns them, in every case they've been on serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which is the Prozac class of drugs.
[02:41:39.935 --> 02:41:41.815]  They were being developed in the early 1980s.
[02:41:42.035 --> 02:41:50.977]  Their own studies by Eli Lilly and others with Prozac showed that it caused a massive increase in suicidal tendencies.
[02:41:51.477 --> 02:42:02.900]  Now they've tested it on rats, shrimp, guinea pigs, you name it, and they found that it causes reckless and even suicidal behavior in not just mammals, but things like shrimp.
[02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:05.101]  But it all makes perfect sense.
[02:42:05.181 --> 02:42:17.491]  When you actually read the molecular breakdown and the drug inserts for these fluorine or fluoride-based serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs, they are in the hallucinogen class.
[02:42:17.551 --> 02:42:20.853]  They are a psychotropic subclass of hallucinogens.
[02:42:21.234 --> 02:42:23.636]  So most days, you're going to have a good trip on this stuff.
[02:42:24.016 --> 02:42:26.098]  You're going to be happy not worrying about a thing in the world.
[02:42:26.738 --> 02:42:28.499]  But what happens when you have a bad trip?
[02:42:28.919 --> 02:42:30.760]  You cut your children's arms and legs off.
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:32.781]  You go into a school and murder people.
[02:42:33.201 --> 02:42:35.703]  In every case that we've seen,
[02:42:36.892 --> 02:42:39.554]  The system knows that these drugs are destroying people.
[02:42:39.834 --> 02:42:41.495]  They're hardcore profiteers.
[02:42:42.015 --> 02:42:51.562]  And statistically, most people that get on the speed-type drugs, or the hallucinogen serotonin reuptake inhibitors, get more psychological problems.
[02:42:51.782 --> 02:42:55.064]  And then the answer is, not less drugs, it's more drugs.
[02:42:55.464 --> 02:43:06.452]  We see the same thing with all these reports coming out in Europe, the United States, and Asia, where 3-year-olds, 5-year-olds, 6-year-olds, 7-year-olds, I mean babies in some cases, are growing breast.
[02:43:06.952 --> 02:43:17.177]  Going into menstruation, starting to have their periods because of the bisphenol A that's in the plastic products and the hormones that are added to the food.
[02:43:17.738 --> 02:43:19.319]  And what do doctors here in the U.S.
[02:43:19.359 --> 02:43:20.559]  do whenever that happens?
[02:43:20.939 --> 02:43:30.364]  The American Medical Association says, give them hormones to counterbalance the hormones that are in the food and water and the packaging.
[02:43:30.745 --> 02:43:34.527]  Instead of, hey, get your kids off of these hormones.
[02:43:35.367 --> 02:43:38.068]  Here's two articles on that subject that just came out today.
[02:43:38.568 --> 02:43:41.128]  Babies with breast shock China.
[02:43:41.628 --> 02:43:45.209]  They're getting upset about children as young as a year and a half old.
[02:43:45.249 --> 02:43:45.869]  Here in the U.S.
[02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:48.390]  it's only three-year-olds who are going into puberty.
[02:43:49.190 --> 02:43:51.351]  In China, you know, a year and a half, two years old.
[02:43:51.771 --> 02:43:53.471]  Babies with breast.
[02:43:53.871 --> 02:43:54.452]  Here's another one.
[02:43:54.652 --> 02:44:00.473]  Fury in China as female babies grow breast after drinking milk laced with hormones.
[02:44:01.893 --> 02:44:04.554]  At least the Chinese are getting angry.
[02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:11.024]  When China catches their executives tanning the milk and the food, they execute them.
[02:44:11.265 --> 02:44:12.365]  And there's been cases of that.
[02:44:12.726 --> 02:44:14.727]  But not here in the United States.
[02:44:14.787 --> 02:44:16.369]  It's all just swept under the rug.
[02:44:18.817 --> 02:44:20.598]  The system counts on your ignorance.
[02:44:20.958 --> 02:44:37.728]  In the last decade, multiple times, over 90% of the EPA and another movement of the FDA, of their own scientists went on record and testified before Congress that sodium fluoride causes cancer, IQ reduction, brain damage, you name it.
[02:44:38.128 --> 02:44:39.489]  It doesn't even strengthen teeth.
[02:44:40.089 --> 02:44:41.091]  And what's the government's answer?
[02:44:41.371 --> 02:44:45.998]  We're going to increase in many cities the amount of fluoride that we're adding to the water.
[02:44:46.338 --> 02:44:55.631]  And now the city of Watsonville has been cited by the California Department of Public Health for failure to comply with an order by the state to fluoridate the water supply.
[02:44:56.152 --> 02:44:59.974]  And now Schwarzenegger has gotten laws rammed through to get this done.
[02:45:00.334 --> 02:45:08.179]  This is a massive chemical attack that reduces fertility, that increases bone cancer, and attacks every organ in the body.
[02:45:08.519 --> 02:45:10.500]  It's admitted on record.
[02:45:10.860 --> 02:45:14.522]  And it's literally being done to make you servile zombies and submissive.
[02:45:14.862 --> 02:45:17.824]  And now the government's coming out saying, yeah, we do do it to make you submissive.
[02:45:18.144 --> 02:45:22.847]  And we want to put lithium in your water to make you submit and be happy.
[02:45:23.187 --> 02:45:26.350]  The government's going to perfect you and make you happy.
[02:45:26.370 --> 02:45:31.713]  And we've got vaccines that will go in and reprogram your brain so you won't feel stressed and get angry.
[02:45:32.394 --> 02:45:34.815]  This is a plague upon all of us all.
[02:45:35.095 --> 02:45:40.479]  This is a military-industrial complex, big pharma war against free humanity.
[02:45:40.699 --> 02:45:41.480]  The facts are in.
[02:45:42.810 --> 02:45:46.132]  We're all victims of this, not just Lindsay Lohan.
[02:45:46.213 --> 02:45:48.134]  They know that they're selling this death.
[02:45:48.494 --> 02:45:49.695]  But let's get into vaccines.
[02:45:50.476 --> 02:46:10.510]  Wolfgang Wudarg, the head of the EU Commission, a medical doctor, conclusively found with his board of other scientists and doctors that the H1N1 was a toxic vaccine and was a hoax, and that medical companies, the big vaccine makers that made tens of billions of dollars, paid off European and other Western governments, including the United States, to go out and hype fears
[02:46:11.411 --> 02:46:22.261]  And now we have the statistics out of England where they've suspended the H1N1 shot because of a ten-fold increase in violent convulsions in under five-year-olds.
[02:46:23.062 --> 02:46:26.806]  It's giving them chronic brain inflammation, brain damage.
[02:46:27.106 --> 02:46:31.710]  And if your child happens to have a convulsion after the vaccines, then the CPS comes and takes them.
[02:46:31.970 --> 02:46:33.131]  Well, now the media's back.
[02:46:33.792 --> 02:46:42.078]  Tom Thumb is offering a big discount on your groceries if you get the new H1N1 shot for 2010, combined with a regular flu shot.
[02:46:42.498 --> 02:46:47.182]  The government is all over the newspaper saying everyone must take it, or we're basically all dead.
[02:46:47.502 --> 02:46:50.104]  So they were caught hoaxing everyone last year.
[02:46:50.424 --> 02:46:51.585]  It came out it was a hoax.
[02:46:52.225 --> 02:46:53.606]  And are they ashamed of what they've done?
[02:46:53.706 --> 02:46:53.926]  No.
[02:46:54.226 --> 02:46:56.647]  They're back pushing it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:56.948 --> 02:46:58.849]  They know full well what they're doing.
[02:46:59.009 --> 02:47:00.229]  Just like the Gardasil shot.
[02:47:00.529 --> 02:47:04.872]  On its own insert, it admits it doesn't protect you from papillomavirus and cervical cancer.
[02:47:05.152 --> 02:47:10.995]  And it admits that it's actually maimed and killed many people and caused autoimmune disorders.
[02:47:11.375 --> 02:47:17.758]  So now they're back again trying to force-feed us their mercury-laced, deadly vaccines in 2010
[02:47:19.279 --> 02:47:24.903]  Even after the EU and the British Medical Journal exposed them for the fraud they were involved in.
[02:47:28.987 --> 02:47:33.570]  I've interviewed the former head of the Pentagon's depleted uranium program, Dr. Doug Rockey.
[02:47:34.170 --> 02:47:46.440]  And up until the mid-1990s, the Pentagon admitted that DU, depleted uranium, was deadly poisonous and radioactive, that it would hurt the people that lived in the countries where we used it, and it would also hurt our troops.
[02:47:46.940 --> 02:48:06.267]  Now they're using it in hundreds of different types of munitions and the statistics and studies are coming in from Iraq in cities like Fallujah where it's been used with a four-fold increase in all cancers and a 12-fold increase in childhood cancers in under 14s and the images
[02:48:06.827 --> 02:48:14.911]  Of the mutated, deformed children with two heads or without legs and the fact that their blood's been tested and they're full of depleted uranium.
[02:48:15.291 --> 02:48:16.351]  It is so inhuman.
[02:48:16.852 --> 02:48:24.075]  And our troops go into these areas and breathe it and absorb it as well and we're seeing massive increases in deformities of their children.
[02:48:24.475 --> 02:48:25.976]  Now what does it say about our government?
[02:48:26.736 --> 02:48:30.941]  That they had developed this stuff in the 40s as a weapon, but they wouldn't use it until 1991.
[02:48:31.762 --> 02:48:38.871]  And there is a multi-billion year half-life on this depleted uranium, and it is a scourge upon humanity.
[02:48:39.111 --> 02:48:44.017]  And it's now being used in firing ranges across the United States, near to major cities.
[02:48:45.069 --> 02:48:47.852]  If you're asking why this is happening, it's not just about profits.
[02:48:47.992 --> 02:48:48.933]  It's about power.
[02:48:49.233 --> 02:48:50.795]  It's about population reduction.
[02:48:51.215 --> 02:48:55.419]  We have covered the White House science czar calling for drugging the water to sterilize people.
[02:48:55.459 --> 02:48:59.523]  We've gone over the hundreds of different government documents that call for it as well.
[02:49:00.044 --> 02:49:05.949]  But just in the last few weeks, one of our InfoWars.com writers did some amazing research and found published
[02:49:06.753 --> 02:49:29.210]  admitted on the Rockefeller Foundation's own website studies where in the sixties they were putting massive amounts of money into compounds that could be added to vaccines so that you'd be given a vaccine for tetanus or the flu that would then go in and reduce fertility so everybody doesn't get sterilized because then people would notice only certain percentages
[02:49:29.890 --> 02:49:35.933]  And so they talked about how to secretly do this and put it into the vaccines to sterilize people.
[02:49:36.453 --> 02:49:40.155]  And now it's been done and they're expanding this system.
[02:49:40.996 --> 02:49:47.139]  There is something to the science of vaccines and how you can take a little of something that's bad so that your body learns to defeat it.
[02:49:47.679 --> 02:49:56.303]  But the issue is the U.N., our own government, has been caught adding real polio to vaccines all over the world every year, killing people en masse, and they just get away with it.
[02:49:56.523 --> 02:49:59.164]  They've been caught adding cancer viruses to polio vaccines.
[02:49:59.424 --> 02:50:04.807]  They've been caught adding other systems to tetanus shots to carry sterilization compounds.
[02:50:05.087 --> 02:50:09.009]  They've been caught doing everything the Rockefellers funded in the 60s.
[02:50:09.549 --> 02:50:13.491]  This is a total military takeover, but it's by stealth.
[02:50:14.031 --> 02:50:19.312]  And it's not just Lindsay Lohan being targeted by these poisons, by these drugs, by the stuff in the water.
[02:50:19.672 --> 02:50:20.692]  It's all of us.
[02:50:21.013 --> 02:50:22.453]  We're all under attack.
[02:50:22.493 --> 02:50:25.233]  And these drugs and chemicals make us more unhealthy.
[02:50:25.474 --> 02:50:27.154]  They make us more mentally unstable.
[02:50:27.434 --> 02:50:30.275]  So the system has a pretext to come in and control our lives.
[02:50:30.655 --> 02:50:36.816]  Please warn everyone you know and spread this video to everyone you can so that we can stop this madness.
[02:50:37.136 --> 02:50:41.017]  Our entire civilization is under threat by the scientific dictatorship.
[02:50:42.554 --> 02:50:43.836]  Folks, it's up to you.
[02:50:44.577 --> 02:50:48.222]  Lindsay Lohan Poisoned is the search term.
[02:50:48.282 --> 02:50:49.043]  Three words.
[02:50:49.263 --> 02:50:51.587]  Lindsay Lohan Poisoned.
[02:50:51.647 --> 02:50:54.471]  Lohan spelled L-O-H-A-N.
[02:50:54.571 --> 02:50:55.953]  Lindsay Lohan Poisoned.
[02:50:56.353 --> 02:50:57.815]  Let's make it number one.
[02:50:57.835 --> 02:50:59.357]  We'll be right back with more news.
[02:51:00.098 --> 02:51:02.459]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[02:51:02.699 --> 02:51:11.364]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.
[02:51:11.524 --> 02:51:23.810]  If you owe $10,000 or more in credit card bills and are struggling to make minimum payments, get ready to take down this number for free information that could potentially save your home, the lifestyle you're accustomed to, and your family's financial well-being.
[02:51:23.990 --> 02:51:24.670]  But don't wait!
[02:51:24.890 --> 02:51:27.872]  Studies show that if most debt problems are confronted directly,
[02:51:28.032 --> 02:51:33.198]  Beneficial settlements, manageable monthly payments, and quick restoration of credit are more easily attained.
[02:51:33.438 --> 02:51:37.803]  Potentially saving you thousands of dollars in interest charges, fees, and unpaid debt.
[02:51:37.943 --> 02:51:38.924]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:51:39.044 --> 02:51:43.349]  Call now for your free information and begin putting your economic house in order today.

[02:51:47.652 --> 02:51:49.533]  Call the American Debt Associates at 800-876-2966.
[02:51:49.553 --> 02:51:49.613]  800-876-2966.
[02:51:49.633 --> 02:51:49.793]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[02:51:49.813 --> 02:51:51.813]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:51:51.833 --> 02:51:53.354]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:51:53.374 --> 02:51:55.435]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:52:07.699 --> 02:52:12.443]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:12.804 --> 02:52:17.007]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:17.327 --> 02:52:19.649]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:19.669 --> 02:52:22.191]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:22.211 --> 02:52:25.133]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:25.454 --> 02:52:33.080]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:33.400 --> 02:52:38.645]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:38.785 --> 02:52:41.588]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:41.628 --> 02:52:45.071]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:45.331 --> 02:52:46.252]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:46.392 --> 02:52:47.713]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:47.733 --> 02:52:48.734]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:47.063 --> 02:53:48.284]  Guaranteed to stop foreclosure.
[02:54:12.500 --> 02:54:23.066]  Continuing with the topic we were just covering, Finland suspends swine flu shots if they're vaccine-linked with neurological disorder.
[02:54:23.446 --> 02:54:25.367]  Well, it causes hundreds of different disorders.
[02:54:25.407 --> 02:54:26.828]  Their own inserts admit that.
[02:54:27.368 --> 02:54:31.291]  England, their own government has said doctors don't give it to under fives.
[02:54:31.471 --> 02:54:33.552]  Tenfold increase in seizures.
[02:54:33.992 --> 02:54:34.673]  In many cases,
[02:54:35.473 --> 02:54:37.914]  Leading to permanent forms of epilepsy.
[02:54:37.994 --> 02:54:39.255]  Totally frying your brain.
[02:54:39.996 --> 02:54:42.957]  And this is on InfoWars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:54:43.598 --> 02:54:45.599]  He's got links to mainstream news reporting on it.
[02:54:45.659 --> 02:54:58.526]  Finland's National Institute for Health and Welfare, the THL, has suspended the use of H1N1 vaccine over fears that the shot is linked to 300% increase in cases of the neurological disorder narcolepsy, where you just fall asleep.
[02:54:59.477 --> 02:55:03.380]  Uncontrollably among children and young people over the last six months.
[02:55:03.860 --> 02:55:12.086]  The news is sure to discourage more parents from vaccinating their children in the coming months with the swine flu shot now being combined with the regular seasonal flu jab.
[02:55:13.087 --> 02:55:16.930]  Recent Rasmussen polls show 52% of Americans were concerned about the safety of the vaccines.
[02:55:17.450 --> 02:55:24.676]  Record low numbers last year and this year took the H1N1 and the regular seasonal because of your efforts, my efforts, and other people getting the word out.
[02:55:25.296 --> 02:55:27.744]  Now the British Medical Journal admits it's a fraud.
[02:55:28.145 --> 02:55:30.433]  The European, uh, EU Health Commission.
[02:55:31.636 --> 02:55:32.857]  This is all fact.
[02:55:33.698 --> 02:55:34.478]  And they don't care.
[02:55:34.518 --> 02:55:36.900]  They're back with their hoax again, saying, take it again.
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:38.301]  Warn everyone you know.
[02:55:38.661 --> 02:55:46.027]  I know a talk show host here in town who didn't believe me about this stuff, took the shot, and his hands and feet got paralyzed, got numb for about a month.
[02:55:46.287 --> 02:55:49.749]  The doctor said, yeah, you have Guillain-Barré, but thank God it went away.
[02:55:50.350 --> 02:55:52.752]  It all varies what it does to you.
[02:55:53.752 --> 02:55:57.915]  Continuing, FDA uses egg recall to demand more power authority over food.
[02:55:58.436 --> 02:56:01.038]  So, no one's gotten even sick from this.
[02:56:04.893 --> 02:56:11.135]  In many areas of the country, but they're recalling it, in two states, 1,300 people have become sickened.
[02:56:11.455 --> 02:56:12.975]  But thank God nobody's died.
[02:56:13.215 --> 02:56:17.156]  But they're trying to use it as a way to totally take over all farm production.
[02:56:17.436 --> 02:56:22.678]  Meanwhile, they're pushing poisonous drugs, vaccines, all of this on everyone.
[02:56:23.238 --> 02:56:25.259]  So very, very important information.
[02:56:26.019 --> 02:56:33.481]  Of course, already covered, the French news agency, oil spill cleanup workers suffered chromosome damage, respiratory illnesses.
[02:56:34.642 --> 02:56:37.903]  And they're still trying to tell everybody it's fine.
[02:56:38.783 --> 02:56:42.624]  You don't need to wear a mask, because if they ever admit it's dangerous, then there could be claims.
[02:56:42.904 --> 02:56:49.106]  So they're knowingly sending you out there to have irrevocable damage.
[02:56:51.126 --> 02:56:54.367]  This just illustrates how the controllers could care less about your health.
[02:56:54.447 --> 02:56:56.668]  In fact, they enjoy lying to you.
[02:56:57.208 --> 02:57:00.669]  Get wise about this, and think of how many people we can wake up
[02:57:01.758 --> 02:57:08.101]  When they go look at Lindsay Lohan poisoned as the number one search term, then they see the video and the news article about it.
[02:57:08.121 --> 02:57:19.065]  I got Kurt doing another one, so when they see the term Lindsay Lohan poisoned, that'll be a minor blurb in the article he's doing right now, and it's going to talk about the vaccines and the brain damage and the poisoning.
[02:57:19.505 --> 02:57:21.906]  And the autoimmune results in the brain.
[02:57:22.407 --> 02:57:29.210]  And you can write your own articles with Lindsay Lohan poison in the headline with your own information that you want to have the public see.
[02:57:29.230 --> 02:57:30.671]  This is going to be a big search term today.
[02:57:31.011 --> 02:57:32.492]  Lindsay Lohan poison.
[02:57:32.852 --> 02:57:34.033]  Continuing with other lies.
[02:57:34.934 --> 02:57:38.075]  More troops head to Iraq as Obama declares mission accomplished.
[02:57:38.155 --> 02:57:42.338]  CNN, Fox, The Guardian, New York Times, General Electric.
[02:57:43.118 --> 02:57:45.759]  You know, they're all admitting, oh yeah, we're sending more troops.
[02:57:45.799 --> 02:57:47.080]  They're all reporting this.
[02:57:47.140 --> 02:57:50.722]  It's all by General Electric, NBC-owned General Electric.
[02:57:51.082 --> 02:58:01.007]  They're all saying, oh, we're just renaming the combat brigades to something else, taking some troops out, sending them to Afghanistan, sending a few thousand home for photo ops when the war is over.
[02:58:01.783 --> 02:58:09.268]  Just like Bush said seven-plus years ago, months after the war started, that the war was over, military operations were over.
[02:58:09.828 --> 02:58:10.509]  Same hoax.
[02:58:10.649 --> 02:58:13.431]  Just like eight years ago, they said Iraq had nukes.
[02:58:13.851 --> 02:58:16.593]  Eight years later, they're saying Iran has nukes.
[02:58:16.633 --> 02:58:19.935]  They just use the same lies over and over again.
[02:58:19.955 --> 02:58:27.340]  Meanwhile, dozens killed in a series of bomb attacks, and different Iraqi news media and officials are saying they think the Iraqi government is bombing.
[02:58:27.360 --> 02:58:30.582]  This is big news in Iraq as a way to keep more U.S.
[02:58:30.622 --> 02:58:31.403]  forces there,
[02:58:32.464 --> 02:58:35.146]  We are out of time, ladies and gentlemen, for this hour.
[02:58:35.386 --> 02:58:37.568]  Don't forget the website InfoWars.com.
[02:58:37.588 --> 02:58:38.308]  God bless you all.
[02:58:38.348 --> 02:58:39.109]  Great job, crew.
[02:58:40.970 --> 02:58:42.131]  Lindsay Lohan poisoned.
[02:58:42.772 --> 02:58:43.893]  Lindsay Lohan poisoned.
[02:58:43.993 --> 02:58:44.854]  That's the search term.
[02:58:44.874 --> 02:58:46.475]  Lindsay Lohan poisoned.
[02:58:46.495 --> 02:58:47.436]  Come on, we can do it!
[02:58:49.261 --> 02:58:53.504]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:53.824 --> 02:58:54.424]  Number one.
[02:58:54.724 --> 02:58:57.886]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:58:58.147 --> 02:58:58.727]  Number two.
[02:58:59.007 --> 02:59:03.570]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:03.910 --> 02:59:04.351]  It's true.
[02:59:04.651 --> 02:59:09.194]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:09.514 --> 02:59:10.074]  Number three.
[02:59:10.354 --> 02:59:13.636]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:13.937 --> 02:59:17.639]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:17.839 --> 02:59:18.379]  Number 4.
[02:59:18.619 --> 02:59:21.000]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:21.380 --> 02:59:24.761]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:25.061 --> 02:59:25.281]  Number 5.
[02:59:25.861 --> 02:59:29.762]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:30.002 --> 02:59:34.764]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
