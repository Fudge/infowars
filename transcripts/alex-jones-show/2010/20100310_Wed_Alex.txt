[00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:01.691]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:02.052 --> 00:00:04.334]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:08.163 --> 00:00:13.346]  We are one hour, eight minutes into this Wednesday edition, the 10th day of March 2010.
[00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:23.032]  For the next 50 minutes or so in this hour, we're joined by the co-author of several of Jesse Ventura's books, Dick Russell.
[00:00:23.052 --> 00:00:26.313]  He also wrote the bestseller, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me.
[00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:31.396]  When I got an advance copy of this book a month ago, I was very impressed with it.
[00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:33.778]  I think it's Ventura's best book, and I've read
[00:00:34.378 --> 00:00:34.958]  Don't have time
[00:00:50.843 --> 00:00:51.403]  I think so.
[00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:11.333]  The true reality that the establishment media calls conspiracy theory.
[00:01:11.473 --> 00:01:25.460]  I mean, I remember 2002, I was saying Saddam didn't have WMDs, I was having former weapons inspectors on, former top CIA analysts on, Iraq on, and the media was calling me and other guests conspiracy theorists.
[00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.571]  And, I mean, here's an ABC News article.
[00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:30.971]  I was on Geraldo Rivera Saturday.
[00:01:31.472 --> 00:01:31.692]  U.S.
[00:01:31.732 --> 00:01:33.473]  military wanted to provoke war with Cuba.
[00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:35.574]  Military drafted plans to terrorize U.S.
[00:01:35.614 --> 00:01:37.075]  cities to provoke war with Cuba.
[00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:42.118]  Staged terror attacks, staged shootings, bombings, hijacked jets by remote control.
[00:01:42.878 --> 00:01:46.040]  And I held up the actual Operation Northwoods document.
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.903]  In fact, give me a document cam shot on that, guys, for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:56.549]  And I held up Northwoods, I held up ABC News, and Geraldo's co-host just said I was a conspiracy theorist.
[00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:58.551]  She said, how dare you make these allegations.
[00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:00.232]  These are not allegations.
[00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:03.795]  Right here, I've got an Army Field Manual.
[00:02:04.836 --> 00:02:08.299]  Army Field Manual, FM-31-20-3, How to Stage Terror Attacks.
[00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.780]  This was in use from 1994 to 2004.
[00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:16.138]  Army Field Manual.
[00:02:16.458 --> 00:02:19.340]  I mean, here's ABC News, staged terror attack plans.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.101]  But they don't care.
[00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:22.382]  They just call it a conspiracy theory.
[00:02:22.802 --> 00:02:27.165]  And I've been watching Ventura on the Today Show and on other programs.
[00:02:27.925 --> 00:02:33.369]  We've got them posted up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, all those different videos.
[00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:37.091]  And they always say, well, this is your opinion, or this is your conspiracy theory.
[00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:37.952]  And Ventura says, no.
[00:02:38.982 --> 00:02:44.527]  I may speculate at the starting or the end of a chapter, but everything in here is government documents and provable information.
[00:02:45.148 --> 00:02:51.154]  And it is an encyclopedia of, really, Ventura's research and Dick Russell's research as well.
[00:02:51.194 --> 00:02:53.856]  Dick's been researching true reality for a long time.
[00:02:55.058 --> 00:03:01.864]  So, I want to walk through some of the chapters and for the rest of the hour, Dick Russell and the censorship by the Huffington Post.
[00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.684]  I want to just add, this book is available.
[00:03:04.904 --> 00:03:06.045]  We bought 3,000 of these.
[00:03:06.065 --> 00:03:06.666]  We've already sold 1,000.
[00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:11.269]  And we just now started shipping it earlier in the week.
[00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:18.254]  And you get a free DVD film, Loose Change Final Cut or Reflections and Warnings, free with the book.
[00:03:18.374 --> 00:03:19.715]  No one can offer you that deal.
[00:03:20.015 --> 00:03:23.257]  Because I want you to have this book, and I also want to fund and expand our operation.
[00:03:23.557 --> 00:03:24.638]  We're in an info war here.
[00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:26.760]  You're our supply line supporting us.
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.143]  It says the first not alone nut.
[00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:33.932]  John Wilkes Booth.
[00:03:33.972 --> 00:03:34.513]  Chapter 2.
[00:03:34.573 --> 00:03:37.214]  The big money plot to overthrow FDR.
[00:03:37.514 --> 00:03:40.275]  That was the Nazi takeover plan with George Bush Sr.'
[00:03:40.255 --> 00:03:40.635]  's father.
[00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:40.635]  3.
[00:03:40.935 --> 00:03:42.335]  The Kennedy assassination.
[00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:45.256]  Biggest cover-up of my lifetime.
[00:03:45.276 --> 00:03:45.256]  4.
[00:03:45.316 --> 00:03:46.777]  The assassination of Malcolm X.
[00:03:47.217 --> 00:03:46.777]  5.
[00:03:47.237 --> 00:03:48.758]  The murder of Martin Luther King.
[00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:48.758]  6.
[00:03:49.398 --> 00:03:51.379]  The assassination of Robert Kennedy.
[00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:51.379]  7.
[00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.139]  Watergate revisited.
[00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:54.640]  The CIA's war against Nixon.
[00:03:55.757 --> 00:03:57.698]  Eight, the Jonestown Massacre.
[00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:01.041]  Nine, October Surprise, the first stolen election.
[00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:03.422]  Ten, your government dealing drugs.
[00:04:03.522 --> 00:04:07.485]  Eleven, the stolen elections of 2000, 2004, and almost 08.
[00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:10.567]  Twelve, what really happened on September 11th.
[00:04:10.647 --> 00:04:12.288]  Thirteen, the Wall Street conspiracy.
[00:04:12.568 --> 00:04:15.670]  Fourteen, the secret plan to end American democracy.
[00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.672]  Epilogue, further reading notes.
[00:04:18.232 --> 00:04:20.754]  This is Jesse Ventura's best book, in my opinion.
[00:04:21.634 --> 00:04:27.898]  And we are very honored to have Dick Russell, co-author and researcher with Ventura, on with us.
[00:04:27.938 --> 00:04:28.738]  Dick, good to have you here.
[00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:29.819]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:04:29.859 --> 00:04:30.740]  Good to be with you today.
[00:04:33.021 --> 00:04:35.142]  Is this your favorite Ventura book?
[00:04:36.263 --> 00:04:50.952]  Well, I really enjoyed working with him on the autobiography, the memoir of his years as governor, and then what happened after that when he went to Harvard and was censored, basically taken off the air at MSNBC because he was, quote, too controversial.
[00:04:51.414 --> 00:04:55.675]  I mean, that was a lot of fun, and that was the book that Don't Start the Revolution Without Me.
[00:04:55.715 --> 00:05:10.380]  But this one, American Conspiracies, is really close to my heart and his, and for many, many years I've been researching and saving material on these subjects and did some fresh interviews along with Jesse also for this book.
[00:05:11.764 --> 00:05:26.296]  Yeah, I mean, I'm thrilled to have it out there, and he's masterful on TV and believes deeply, and we've got to get the truth out about a lot of the things that the government's been covering up for many, many years, and so it's great to have collaborated with him on this.
[00:05:27.697 --> 00:05:29.978]  Well, Dick, this is a hardcore book.
[00:05:30.078 --> 00:05:32.700]  I mean, I've read it now almost twice.
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.361]  I've almost gone through it a second time.
[00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:37.023]  And I agree with the analysis in this book.
[00:05:37.063 --> 00:05:41.245]  There's deep research here because I've been researching this for 16 years, 14 on air.
[00:05:41.846 --> 00:05:45.608]  And, you know, I'm kind of one of the Grand Poobahs of, you
[00:05:45.788 --> 00:05:45.968]  Well, yeah.
[00:05:45.988 --> 00:05:46.408]  I mean, he is.
[00:05:46.428 --> 00:05:48.429]  And to tell you the truth, I mean, putting this book together,
[00:06:05.638 --> 00:06:06.679]  Kind of scary to me.
[00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:33.639]  I mean, the fact that when you look at the history of the last, you know, especially 40, 50 years, really starting, you know, with the CIA getting so much power in the 50s, but then with the Kennedy assassination, on through these various events, and you look at what's really been going on in the country, leading up, you know, finally culminating with the years of George W. Bush and the two stolen elections and nearly a third, and then the cover-up around 9-11,
[00:06:34.813 --> 00:06:45.842]  I mean, it is indeed heavy duty, and I know that Jesse told me at one point that his wife, Terri, was kind of scared by the whole thing.
[00:06:45.882 --> 00:06:57.791]  But I feel like it's crucially important for the American people to take an alternative view, to realize that what we've been told all these years is not necessarily the accurate truth.
[00:06:57.811 --> 00:07:01.855]  What we read in the history books, what the kids are being taught, and so it's time for
[00:07:02.662 --> 00:07:10.534]  Time for this alternative picture to emerge and for people to start raising questions that they hadn't before.
[00:07:11.943 --> 00:07:20.990]  Well, cutting right to the bone here, the establishment in literally hundreds of publications a week, and I'm sure you've noticed this, Dick, is panicking.
[00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.853]  They're saying these conspiracy people are taking over the whole culture.
[00:07:25.554 --> 00:07:26.335]  It's crazy.
[00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:28.877]  No one believes the mainstream media or the government anymore.
[00:07:29.237 --> 00:07:30.338]  These people are nuts.
[00:07:30.938 --> 00:07:32.399]  There's no world government.
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.121]  There's no government drug dealing.
[00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:36.403]  There's no lying about WMDs.
[00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:38.945]  And they're only digging the hole deeper for themselves.
[00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:54.911]  They can't set the parameters of reality anymore, and so there's a total loss of confidence in the system, and the system is only resorting to more name-calling, and that old trick of calling us conspiracy theorists isn't working anymore.
[00:07:55.811 --> 00:07:56.972]  Well, yeah, I think that's true.
[00:07:57.032 --> 00:08:08.016]  I mean, starting with the Kennedy assassination, where, you know, you have all these... the only books that are going to get reviewed by the establishment media are the ones that come out and say that, yeah, the Warren Commission was right and Oswald did it alone.
[00:08:08.717 --> 00:08:14.682]  But the fact is, I think the last figure I saw was 75 to 90% of the American people don't believe that.
[00:08:14.802 --> 00:08:16.583]  They know it was some kind of conspiracy.
[00:08:16.623 --> 00:08:24.550]  And you start there with this terrible event that really changed the course of American history back in 1963, and you go on up to today.
[00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.352]  And you know, the fact is, the public is getting wise to this.
[00:08:27.432 --> 00:08:36.420]  And yet the media, of course, are going to continue, which are mostly corporate-owned, as I'm sure most of your listeners know, are going to continue to promulgate
[00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.632]  Now, did you work on this book in the U.S.
[00:08:48.652 --> 00:08:50.794]  with Ventura, or did you do this down at the beach?
[00:08:50.854 --> 00:08:53.076]  It seems he told me you were down there visiting with him in Mexico.
[00:08:54.489 --> 00:08:56.410]  Yeah, well both.
[00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:59.673]  Especially for our first book together, we did a lot of that in Mexico.
[00:08:59.733 --> 00:09:05.276]  I have a place there, my friends do, that I stay in sometimes in the winter.
[00:09:05.296 --> 00:09:13.021]  I was there for six months for the first book and we would meet every week and I would interview him and then transcribe the tapes and we put the book together like that.
[00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:14.982]  For this book, I did more of it in the U.S.
[00:09:15.002 --> 00:09:20.126]  because this is where my files are and then he and I would communicate on the phone and I would go out to
[00:09:27.209 --> 00:09:35.032]  When we were shooting Conspiracy Theory out in California, I came into the hotel and was checking in and Ventura came up behind me.
[00:09:35.052 --> 00:09:41.235]  He was checking in at the same time and we were talking and he said, Alex, I just got back from Alaska.
[00:09:41.295 --> 00:09:42.295]  My head is spinning.
[00:09:42.635 --> 00:09:44.376]  This stuff just gets deeper and deeper.
[00:09:44.956 --> 00:09:46.477]  And again, I mean Ventura
[00:09:46.877 --> 00:09:47.898]  Well, I guess that's true, of course.
[00:09:47.918 --> 00:09:51.740]  You know, as he has said, and I'm sure he'll tell you when you have mine later in the week, you know, he's, what he wants,
[00:10:15.373 --> 00:10:24.396]  It's the fact that in a hundred years from now, when people realize that there was an alternative view than what we're getting in the Orwellian history books.
[00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:28.257]  And he's a very dedicated reader.
[00:10:28.297 --> 00:10:29.958]  I mean, he does indeed study.
[00:10:29.978 --> 00:10:31.699]  He's an extremely intelligent man.
[00:10:32.039 --> 00:10:33.439]  He's a very creative thinker.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.061]  Clearly, far beyond most people who've been in just the wrestling arena.
[00:10:38.081 --> 00:10:41.282]  Otherwise, he would never have been elected governor of Minnesota.
[00:10:41.702 --> 00:10:43.383]  So he really does pay attention to
[00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:50.298]  To these things, and you know, I think it's making a real difference with putting his views out there.
[00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:57.968]  Well, I have a variant on that, and that's what I told Texas Monthly in this month's issue at the end of the article.
[00:10:58.648 --> 00:11:01.049]  I don't just want people in 100 years, and that's important.
[00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:19.621]  I want people in 20 years, because we lay out just how illegitimate and unaccountable this power structure is globally, that as things get worse and worse, we put out an alternative view of what really happened, so that people understand the type of tyranny and corruption we're dealing with, so we have a chance to remove it.
[00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.590]  Well, of course.
[00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.393]  So do I. Otherwise, there's no reason to do the book really now.
[00:11:23.493 --> 00:11:31.921]  I mean, you know, the book is hopefully going to catch the attention of a lot of people and make people think in a different way than maybe they did before they read it.
[00:11:33.062 --> 00:11:35.864]  Sure, I'm hoping that that's true as we speak.
[00:11:37.005 --> 00:11:41.509]  Dick Russell, co-author, researcher with Jesse Ventura on the new, already bestseller,
[00:11:42.583 --> 00:11:48.132]  American Conspiracies, number seven on the Amazon charts, but you want to get it at InfoWars.com.
[00:11:48.152 --> 00:11:49.274]  You get a free film with it.
[00:11:49.474 --> 00:11:50.576]  I want everybody to read this book.
[00:11:50.816 --> 00:11:52.218]  We'll be back and get into the book.
[00:11:52.418 --> 00:11:55.704]  We'll ask Dick his favorite chapters of the most scary chapters in the book.
[00:11:57.082 --> 00:12:01.343]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.
[00:12:01.704 --> 00:12:09.246]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.
[00:12:09.486 --> 00:12:24.291]  The revolutionary Berkey light systems include a set of self-sterilizing and re-cleanable black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and removes harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.
[00:12:24.591 --> 00:12:29.213]  Order the Berkey light system today, complete with two black Berkey elements for only two hundred and nine dollars.
[00:12:29.273 --> 00:12:33.895]  And the Berkey guy will include three sport Berkey water bottles and ship everything to you free of charge.
[00:12:34.095 --> 00:12:34.575]  That's right.
[00:12:34.775 --> 00:12:38.417]  Three sport Berkey water bottles and free shipping and eighty seven dollar value.
[00:12:38.517 --> 00:12:40.778]  Yours free, but only for a limited time.
[00:12:41.038 --> 00:12:42.218]  Just call the Berkey guy at 1 8 7 7 8 8 6 36 53.
[00:12:42.698 --> 00:12:43.099]  Now to order.
[00:12:43.119 --> 00:12:44.159]  That's 1 8 7 7 8 8 6 36 53 or order online now at
[00:12:56.661 --> 00:12:58.862]  Hi, this is Peter Krochnovel with Midas Resources.
[00:12:59.042 --> 00:13:03.725]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high, and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:10.289]  The multiple federal stimulus packages have been an utter failure, unless you're an executive for AIG, a large banking or investment institution.
[00:13:10.429 --> 00:13:12.871]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:13:12.931 --> 00:13:15.412]  People like you and I can't go to Washington for a bailout.

[00:15:00.015 --> 00:15:11.102]  Crowded public places, global pandemics and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?

[00:16:05.765 --> 00:16:10.786]  Dick Russell, Jesse Ventura, New York Times best-selling author, American Conspiracies.
[00:16:10.806 --> 00:16:11.546]  He's our guest.
[00:16:12.066 --> 00:16:16.347]  I want to get into different chapters in the book with you, Dick, today, and I appreciate you spending time with us.
[00:16:16.367 --> 00:16:30.051]  I know you're busy, but I was pretty, well, actually, I wasn't that shocked, but when you emailed us yesterday to let us know, and I appreciate you doing that, that the Huffington Post had sent the Ventura article into the Orwellian memory hole.
[00:16:30.391 --> 00:16:31.031]  What happened there?
[00:16:32.014 --> 00:16:35.436]  Yeah, it was a very bizarre, to me, very bizarre thing that happened.
[00:16:35.456 --> 00:16:44.500]  The Huffington Post had asked for a series of pieces to run with excerpts from the book over the next couple of weeks, and the first one was fine.
[00:16:44.581 --> 00:17:00.289]  It was about the whole drug situation, and of course Jesse has commented publicly that he'd like to see marijuana legalized, for example, and take care of a lot of the problems that we're seeing with big money and all of that.
[00:17:01.769 --> 00:17:03.249]  What happened with the second piece?
[00:17:03.469 --> 00:17:06.810]  The second piece was called, What Really Happened on September 11th?
[00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:29.134]  And the intro to it was simply reporting the fact, and Jesse and I worked on this together, that while you didn't say anything about it in the mainstream media, there was this conference in San Francisco a couple weeks ago where more than a thousand architects and engineers signed a petition demanding that Congress start a new investigation into the destruction of the Twin Towers and Building 7 on September 11th.
[00:17:30.109 --> 00:17:41.841]  Okay, and then it cuts to an excerpt from the book, just raising the question, you know, could there have been something other than those hijacked planes that brought down the towers, and could there have been controlled demolition involved?
[00:17:42.482 --> 00:17:47.848]  Okay, so this goes up on the Huffington Post yesterday morning on the front.
[00:17:48.706 --> 00:17:49.947]  We're good to go.
[00:18:19.008 --> 00:18:28.872]  And, you know, again, it really stunned me and made me think, wow, the Huffington Post, I mean, I admire Arianna Huffington and generally what they do with this.
[00:18:28.932 --> 00:18:32.973]  And even this Internet blog is suddenly, who's talking to these people?
[00:18:33.013 --> 00:18:37.595]  Is this order coming down from on high or what's really going on?
[00:18:37.675 --> 00:18:42.477]  So Mark Crispin Miller put out the piece and, you know,
[00:18:43.445 --> 00:18:43.705]  I think so.
[00:18:59.557 --> 00:19:07.782]  Well, there are peer-reviewed, as you know, Dick, journals of scientists, of physicists going over Building 7's collapse.
[00:19:07.922 --> 00:19:11.744]  NIST has had to admit, after years of denying it, it was free fall.
[00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:13.725]  They say thermal expansion.
[00:19:13.765 --> 00:19:15.066]  They don't know why this happened.
[00:19:15.526 --> 00:19:17.247]  No other steel buildings ever did this.
[00:19:18.048 --> 00:19:21.030]  You have a thousand architects and engineers in an international
[00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:22.531]  We're good to go.
[00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.112]  And you have all these questions.
[00:19:45.152 --> 00:20:04.464]  They can't just come out and say that, oh, it's a conspiracy theory, where, depending on the poll, 36 to 84 percent in scientific polls, it varies widely, don't believe the official story, and you have six of the ten 9-11 commissioners saying that there was a lot of deception and cover-up that was going on.
[00:20:05.179 --> 00:20:05.639]  Well, yeah.
[00:20:05.739 --> 00:20:14.881]  The 9-11 Commission, I think, has been shown, even in a recent book by this guy, Farmer, who was part of it, that, you know, there's a huge cover-up on the level of the Warren Commission, if not worse.
[00:20:14.961 --> 00:20:28.764]  And, you know, that they would only examine the evidence that led to the conclusion that they had already preconceived, and that the Bush administration had appointed Zelikow to run it, who was, you know, one of their people.
[00:20:29.324 --> 00:20:31.585]  I mean, you know, what's going on?
[00:20:32.045 --> 00:20:42.708]  I mean, if you think about it, to say that the 9-11 attacks were done by bin Laden and these 19 members of al-Qaeda, isn't that a conspiracy theory?
[00:20:43.088 --> 00:20:45.388]  I mean, weren't Bush and Cheney putting out a conspiracy theory?
[00:20:46.069 --> 00:20:51.490]  Really, I mean, it just makes no sense to me that the Huffington Post would react this way.
[00:20:52.305 --> 00:21:07.647]  I have never in eight years of 9-11 Truth seen the media demonizing 9-11 Truth, spending more time on 9-11 Truth like they are now, to the point that I said in the last three months I believe they're going to stage attacks on government buildings, and that's in Northwoods.
[00:21:08.348 --> 00:21:30.996]  Fake shootings and try to demonize 9-11 truth because they kept saying 9-11 truth is violent and we've never been violent and I saw them getting the public ready for it and so voila it happens but when we come back I want to ask you Dick Russell why is the system so scared of 9-11 truth and asking questions generally then I want to walk through some of the chapters in the book and ask you what you think
[00:21:31.856 --> 00:21:36.641]  The best chapters are the most informative or the most well-documented chapters are in the book.
[00:21:37.262 --> 00:21:43.448]  He is the co-author of two books with Jesse Ventura and his latest is American Conspiracies.
[00:21:43.488 --> 00:21:45.430]  He's Dick Russell joining us now.
[00:21:45.731 --> 00:21:46.752]  Long segment coming up.
[00:21:46.932 --> 00:21:47.833]  We're on the march.
[00:21:48.313 --> 00:21:49.895]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:50.836 --> 00:21:53.519]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:57.256 --> 00:22:00.919]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:22:00.939 --> 00:22:04.282]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:22:04.502 --> 00:22:09.286]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:09.306 --> 00:22:15.551]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:15.711 --> 00:22:17.953]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:22:18.453 --> 00:22:18.753]  Tim Geithner?
[00:22:18.773 --> 00:22:19.194]  Bernanke?
[00:22:19.294 --> 00:22:19.894]  They're arsonists!
[00:22:19.954 --> 00:22:21.235]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:21.255 --> 00:22:23.497]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:37.389 --> 00:22:41.314]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:22:41.754 --> 00:22:44.338]  we have seen a fall of the republic.

[00:23:01.708 --> 00:23:09.834]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:23:10.575 --> 00:23:14.618]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:23:15.198 --> 00:23:26.027]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:23:26.647 --> 00:23:35.651]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:23:36.152 --> 00:23:41.194]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.421]  Remain in your houses.
[00:24:00.221 --> 00:24:05.384]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:24:06.005 --> 00:24:07.025]  Will they do it?
[00:24:07.365 --> 00:24:09.326]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:24:09.987 --> 00:24:15.970]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:24:16.431 --> 00:24:17.751]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:24:18.632 --> 00:24:20.673]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[00:24:22.894 --> 00:24:27.199]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:32.064]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:24:32.705 --> 00:24:37.530]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:24:38.431 --> 00:24:46.574]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.

[00:25:06.385 --> 00:25:07.427]  Central Standard Time.
[00:25:07.447 --> 00:25:08.909]  We are here live.
[00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:10.272]  Ladies and gentlemen...

[00:25:29.703 --> 00:25:33.086]  I saw a Nightline special the other evening demonizing 9-11 truth.
[00:25:35.296 --> 00:25:41.640]  And they said, 9-11 truthers claim that the 9-11 Commission says that there were questions, but that's not true.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.443]  And they cut to Lee Hamilton saying, no, it was quite conclusive, everything.
[00:25:46.863 --> 00:25:47.864]  Total lie.
[00:25:48.004 --> 00:25:50.645]  Six of the ten are in newspapers, have written books.
[00:25:51.086 --> 00:25:54.127]  Farmer, one of the head lawyers, says it was all a fraud.
[00:25:54.167 --> 00:25:58.910]  The Pentagon was, quote, in a criminal cover-up, that there should be criminal investigations.
[00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.071]  That's in the Washington Post.
[00:26:00.611 --> 00:26:03.113]  But Nightline thinks you're so stupid.
[00:26:04.212 --> 00:26:16.383]  That they sit there and deceive you, and then they showed a clip from American Conspiracy's author Jesse Ventura on Conspiracy Theory, his TV show, number one on cable.
[00:26:18.587 --> 00:26:22.729]  Above all the major news shows on all the other cable shows except for Fox.
[00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.051]  Number one news show on TruTV.
[00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:29.293]  Number one above all the networks except for Fox.
[00:26:29.313 --> 00:26:30.473]  So really number two overall.
[00:26:30.493 --> 00:26:36.637]  But number one for a new show out of the gates and maybe Ventura will have news for us on the TV show whether it's been picked up.
[00:26:36.837 --> 00:26:38.518]  I mean I know but I'm not going to say.
[00:26:38.538 --> 00:26:41.880]  He probably won't say so we'll just leave it till.
[00:26:42.682 --> 00:26:46.744]  We'll leave the good news or the bad news, whatever the news is, for the future.
[00:26:47.485 --> 00:26:56.030]  But that's why the system is losing so much credibility, because many Americans have read 9-11 commissioners saying there was a cover-up, there were lies.
[00:26:56.791 --> 00:27:03.154]  Dick, I mean, doesn't the system understand what they're doing to themselves with this type of continued deceit?
[00:27:03.475 --> 00:27:10.639]  And in the piece, they demonized Ventura, saying, these conspiracy theories are getting so popular, even Jesse Ventura's doing it.
[00:27:11.786 --> 00:27:14.648]  Well, you know... Yes, sir.
[00:27:14.948 --> 00:27:15.268]  Yes, sir.
[00:27:15.628 --> 00:27:16.869]  It doesn't surprise me.
[00:27:16.949 --> 00:27:26.134]  I mean... You gotta figure that... You know, the media... My phone seems to be losing its juice here.
[00:27:26.154 --> 00:27:29.956]  Yeah, I can hear you, Dick.
[00:27:29.976 --> 00:27:31.537]  Do you have a landline you can pick up?
[00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:37.501]  Let me... This is the only landline I've got.
[00:27:38.962 --> 00:27:40.723]  Alex, if you call me back in...
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:48.161]  I'm going to put you on hold and let you handle it with my producers.
[00:28:03.135 --> 00:28:08.682]  Not a cordless, because number one, cordlesses don't have as good audio, and they run out on you on air.
[00:28:09.303 --> 00:28:14.289]  So that's a 101 that we ask guests, and then we will avert many of these problems.
[00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:18.614]  But regardless, it's technology.
[00:28:19.755 --> 00:28:20.936]  This is just what goes on.
[00:28:21.236 --> 00:28:29.599]  Seems like phone quality and electronics quality just keeps going down and down and down as a society.
[00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:37.963]  Let me go ahead since we're doing this now and shift gears into some other subjects.
[00:28:38.023 --> 00:28:48.187]  Jesse Ventura again will be joining us for a full hour off a hard line from his home in Minnesota on
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:49.920]  Friday.
[00:28:51.442 --> 00:28:51.782]  Okay.
[00:28:53.123 --> 00:29:01.029]  Continuing, it's not just the censorship of Jesse Ventura's article.
[00:29:01.089 --> 00:29:02.831]  It's not just the calls for internet censorship.
[00:29:02.871 --> 00:29:11.177]  It's just not the distributed denial of service attack that we were under yesterday and continuing into today.
[00:29:12.699 --> 00:29:13.719]  There is an attempt
[00:29:14.685 --> 00:29:19.209]  As Cass Sunstein at the White House says, to restrict free speech, period.
[00:29:19.609 --> 00:29:24.233]  And that's because the system now admits that, quote, conspiracy theories are taking over.
[00:29:24.553 --> 00:29:25.794]  It's not conspiracy theories.
[00:29:26.415 --> 00:29:37.384]  It's a loss of confidence in the system from lies about WMDs and lies about banker bailouts and stolen elections and the CIA crashing airplanes full of pure cocaine in Mexico.
[00:29:37.824 --> 00:29:39.366]  The people know the truth.
[00:29:39.986 --> 00:29:41.228]  We've got Dick Russell back.
[00:29:41.569 --> 00:29:49.141]  Dick, you heard the point I was making before your phone cut out about, again, the system really seems to be panicking right now.
[00:29:53.024 --> 00:29:54.045]  There's good reason for it.
[00:29:54.085 --> 00:30:09.218]  I mean, people are finally starting to wake up and realize that indeed, if the Bush administration would take us under false pretenses into the war in Iraq, obviously in 2000 the Supreme Court handed them the election and there was a lot more going on than that.
[00:30:09.238 --> 00:30:20.027]  A lot of questions being raised about September 11th and whether at the very least, I mean, all the warnings, at least we know that publicly, that mainstream media couldn't avoid that.
[00:30:21.408 --> 00:30:27.169]  There were so many warnings coming in that something was going to happen that were completely ignored by the Bush people.
[00:30:27.249 --> 00:30:33.730]  Whether they then orchestrated it, of course, that's a taboo question, but very much an open question in my mind.
[00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:45.992]  But the fact is that most of the corporate media will not look at these things, just as they've never looked at the earlier assassinations, and whether there were more than Oswald and Sirhan and James Earl Ray involved.
[00:30:46.192 --> 00:30:49.973]  And that's what, of course, we're trying to do in American conspiracies, is bring these things
[00:30:50.333 --> 00:30:57.735]  So where do you see this going as more and more of the public discover they've been lied to and the establishment media and government and corporate line is you're a conspiracy theorist?
[00:31:10.748 --> 00:31:12.989]  Well, I think things are getting more and more polarized.
[00:31:13.069 --> 00:31:18.191]  I mean, people really should be calling for new investigations into what happened.
[00:31:18.231 --> 00:31:28.315]  I'm not saying that there's going to be a legitimate response to this, but if enough people do it and are ready to take to the streets for some kind of real action.
[00:31:32.477 --> 00:31:44.048]  To get the truth out about what we've been told, and also, you know, in terms of getting out there and pushing for the health care reform, for doing something about global warming, all these things I believe should be getting much more of a citizen response.
[00:31:44.688 --> 00:31:55.318]  And right now, I guess we're just all, many of us are too comfortable to do it, but I think people's eyes are being opened and, you know, it's going to get interesting in the next few years.
[00:31:55.779 --> 00:32:13.985]  Well, see, Dick, separately, you know, Jesse did an investigation of supposed man-made global warming, and he believed in it as well, like you just said you do, and that's fine, you're welcome to your research and your opinion, but then he did find massive evidence of them cooking the books in ClimateGate.
[00:32:14.005 --> 00:32:14.965]  Are you concerned about that?
[00:32:16.553 --> 00:32:17.994]  Well, here's what I'm concerned about.
[00:32:18.014 --> 00:32:36.512]  I'm much more concerned about the fact that a lot of these big oil and coal companies have bought and paid scientific experts who are coming out and claiming that the very strong evidence that the International Panel for Climate Change and others have come to, that it's very real.
[00:32:37.052 --> 00:32:38.093]  But they've bought these guys.
[00:32:38.133 --> 00:32:39.194]  They're hired guns.
[00:32:39.474 --> 00:32:41.756]  And to me, that's a much bigger conspiracy.
[00:32:41.796 --> 00:32:48.502]  I mean, you know, I don't believe in cap-and-trade legislation or a solution is going to make that much of a difference.
[00:32:48.542 --> 00:32:55.488]  And yes, I've read, certainly companies like Goldman Sachs are planning to make a killing off this, and I'm opposed to that.
[00:32:55.508 --> 00:32:56.829]  I don't think it's a real solution.
[00:32:56.889 --> 00:33:04.996]  But, you know, it is a very real situation and something that we've got to be hip to and looking to do something about.
[00:33:05.726 --> 00:33:14.413]  Dick Russell, co-author with Jesse Ventura of Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, a New York Times bestseller, and already a bestseller only officially out since Monday.
[00:33:14.433 --> 00:33:15.995]  So we're three days in.
[00:33:16.335 --> 00:33:17.716]  American Conspiracy.
[00:33:19.237 --> 00:33:19.458]  Dick?
[00:33:20.453 --> 00:33:30.275]  Bottom line, we do have serious environmental crises from my research, like genetic engineering, open-air planting of these pharmacological crops, but I see nothing being done about that.
[00:33:30.335 --> 00:33:34.716]  Instead, a call to tax carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[00:33:35.297 --> 00:33:43.979]  But expanding on the book, there's so many alternate views of history, so much evidence of government lies in many of the...
[00:33:45.379 --> 00:33:52.645]  Well, I think they were the most clear examples of cover-up and of major events that have changed the course of our American history.
[00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:07.132]  And, you know, we could have looked at other things.
[00:34:07.152 --> 00:34:18.564]  We could have taken on maybe UFOs or, you know, I'm not saying that there are not other important subjects to be looked at, but these seemed like the ones that really make a huge difference in all our lives.
[00:34:18.924 --> 00:34:24.450]  For example, the stolen elections of recent years that allowed the Bush administration two terms.
[00:34:26.488 --> 00:34:30.772]  And from my research, it doesn't matter whether you see yourself as a conservative or a liberal.
[00:34:31.172 --> 00:34:32.833]  If an election is stolen, it's stolen.
[00:34:32.853 --> 00:34:37.617]  And there's no doubt the 2000 and 2004 elections were rigged.
[00:34:37.977 --> 00:34:39.939]  Let's talk about that chapter in the book.
[00:34:41.209 --> 00:34:46.271]  Yeah, I think that chapter has some of the new evidence that's really going to be compelling to people.
[00:34:46.291 --> 00:34:48.352]  You know, I'll tell you a personal story.
[00:34:48.792 --> 00:34:50.513]  I ran into John Kerry.
[00:34:50.793 --> 00:35:01.517]  Of course, he ran for president in 2004 at a fundraiser thing in Boston, and I talked to him for a little bit, and I asked him if he was aware, because I had done a piece with Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[00:35:02.037 --> 00:35:09.900]  in Rolling Stone about the electronic voting machines and the theft of the election, and he said, I know I won the election.
[00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:14.132]  But by the time my lawyers, he went on, could come up with a smoking gun in Ohio, it was too late.
[00:35:14.833 --> 00:35:21.757]  So, you know, my thought after that was, well, if Kerry knows this, then how come he's never spoken out publicly about it?
[00:35:21.837 --> 00:35:25.159]  I mean, wouldn't this be something that you'd at least want the American people to know?
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:39.809]  In my research into this and working with Governor Ventura on it, we came across this really interesting story of a guy named Michael Connell, who was the IT guy, the computer guy, the expert for Karl Rove.
[00:35:41.303 --> 00:35:41.964]  For some years.
[00:35:42.264 --> 00:35:44.285]  And strong evidence.
[00:35:44.865 --> 00:36:04.657]  And I interviewed several people about this, and there's a lawsuit in Ohio that brought him into it as well, that he wasn't directly involved in rigging the 2004 election in Ohio, which of course decided the election, and you had Secretary of State Blackwell who was very much involved with the Bush people in doing this.
[00:36:05.317 --> 00:36:22.992]  I'm not going to get into all the details of computer, you know, what they call a man-in-the-middle plan, but they had this whole system set up where they could send the votes from the various Ohio precincts or districts to a voting machine out in Chattanooga, Tennessee, run by another operative.
[00:36:23.453 --> 00:36:30.559]  They could have apparently been then sending this on even to the war room in the White House, but they were changing votes that night.
[00:36:31.099 --> 00:36:36.221]  And changing them in such a way that Bush was going to win Ohio, at least technically speaking.
[00:36:36.481 --> 00:36:56.449]  And this guy, Connell, he continued to work for the Republican Party, and as late as 2008, not too long before the election, he was called into court to give a deposition, in this case that had been brought by some people in Ohio, about what had happened there.
[00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:02.435]  He was stonewalling to some degree, but apparently ready to talk.
[00:37:03.136 --> 00:37:16.834]  And there's pretty strong indications that Karl Rove, who was saying a week before the 2008 election that McCain still pulled it out, that when McConnell was called in to give a deposition,
[00:37:17.532 --> 00:37:22.754]  The day before the election, that they decided, hey, wait a minute, you know, we can't go forward with this.
[00:37:23.114 --> 00:37:25.094]  Plus, Obama's probably got too big a lead.
[00:37:26.335 --> 00:37:31.457]  If we try to steal this one, too, with Connell and others, manipulating the computers, we're going to be found out.
[00:37:31.877 --> 00:37:38.839]  And so suddenly, the night before, Roe wrote a column indicating, saying that, no, Obama's going to win by a relative landslide.
[00:37:39.577 --> 00:37:43.059]  So, there was a possibility they were going to try to steal that election, too.
[00:37:43.679 --> 00:37:45.460]  And then, what happens to Mike Connell?
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.362]  About a month later, he's flying back in his private plane from Washington, D.C.
[00:37:49.382 --> 00:37:55.665]  to Ohio, where he lived, and the plane goes down under very suspicious circumstances, and Connell is killed.
[00:37:56.305 --> 00:38:04.909]  So, rack that up with another mysterious death in this whole process, of which there have been many, you know, dating back to the Kennedy assassination, certainly.
[00:38:06.138 --> 00:38:06.879]  Absolutely.
[00:38:07.359 --> 00:38:09.301]  Let's get into some of the other sections.
[00:38:09.421 --> 00:38:11.283]  Your government is dealing drugs.
[00:38:11.804 --> 00:38:16.188]  That's a bold statement, but it's absolutely part of historical fact.
[00:38:16.629 --> 00:38:25.377]  Even the 1996 CIA Inspector General testified to Congress that was the case of the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s.
[00:38:25.858 --> 00:38:27.840]  But let's get into that chapter a little bit here.
[00:38:29.124 --> 00:38:43.777]  Yeah, well, it really goes back, you know, to the formation of the CIA and bringing heroin out of Southeast Asia to fund a lot of their activities, working with the big mafia drug lords like Lucky Luciano back during World War II when there was still the OSS.
[00:38:44.357 --> 00:38:54.006]  Then, of course, during Vietnam there was this whole Golden Triangle in Southeast Asia where, again, a lot of money for covert operations was being, you know,
[00:38:54.594 --> 00:38:58.596]  Funneled through and also making some private fortunes for some of the agency people.
[00:38:59.356 --> 00:39:01.677]  Places like the Nugent Hand Bank, for example.
[00:39:01.737 --> 00:39:02.918]  My people might remember that.
[00:39:02.958 --> 00:39:07.660]  They were channeling funds through that bank for covert ops, all drug money.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.100]  And then the Iran-Contra years.
[00:39:10.161 --> 00:39:19.945]  It's public record that, although they didn't want to get into it too much in those Iran-Contra hearings, which, by the way, Lee Hamilton was one of the chairs of, the guy who ended up chairing the 9-11 Commission.
[00:39:20.869 --> 00:39:32.053]  Um, Iran-Contra affair was very much involved with the Contras, you know, being funded by drug money that Oliver North and others were helping raise for them.
[00:39:32.133 --> 00:39:34.534]  So, you know, I mean, this has been going on a long time.
[00:39:34.594 --> 00:39:41.176]  And Gary Webb, people may remember him, he's the journalist who broke the story in the San Jose Mercury News about the...
[00:39:41.716 --> 00:39:41.996]  That's right.
[00:39:42.056 --> 00:39:44.077]  Well, Gary Webb was found dead.
[00:39:44.137 --> 00:39:46.417]  I don't know the details of it.
[00:39:59.815 --> 00:40:05.340]  But yeah, it was allegedly suicide, and of course he was, before that, the media just destroyed him.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:14.169]  You know, he came out and did this whole series of articles that he was supposedly blowing smoke, and you know, the fact is that he'd come out with something that was absolutely right on.
[00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:16.731]  That the drug gangs in L.A.
[00:40:16.791 --> 00:40:18.293]  were very involved with the CIA.
[00:40:19.933 --> 00:40:47.531]  And then you had the whole BCCI, the Bank of Crooks and Criminals, really, scandal a little bit later, and right up to today, where you've got a situation where in Afghanistan, biggest opium-growing area in the world for heroin coming into this country, Pakistani intelligence service being very involved, along with the President's brother in Afghanistan with the drug trade, and of course Mexico, where
[00:40:48.757 --> 00:40:59.020]  You know, we're supposedly fighting this war on drugs, but the fact is that, you know how many people have been killed between December 2006 and the spring of 2009?
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:02.642]  More than 10,000 people were killed in those drug wars in Mexico.
[00:41:04.514 --> 00:41:09.621]  I mean, this is all about, again, a lot of people looking the other way.
[00:41:09.641 --> 00:41:11.403]  Fighting over the turf.
[00:41:11.484 --> 00:41:14.187]  And that's what's so incredible about this book.
[00:41:14.227 --> 00:41:20.856]  I mean, I study this stuff constantly and I find most books boring or not accurate information.
[00:41:22.658 --> 00:41:23.639]  Gold information.
[00:41:23.659 --> 00:41:29.941]  This is blue-chip writing that we're talking about here, and it's again so bold.
[00:41:30.461 --> 00:41:33.843]  I mean, you're learning about how they kill a lot of people that prominently oppose them.
[00:41:34.703 --> 00:41:38.665]  I would imagine you've gotten the willies a few times, or, you know, the chills.
[00:41:39.985 --> 00:41:43.427]  Have you ever gotten spooked, Dick, knowing you were writing this book and it was coming out?
[00:41:43.487 --> 00:41:47.208]  Because you get into the Wall Street conspiracy, ripping everybody off by design.
[00:41:47.569 --> 00:41:50.210]  You get into the secret plan to destroy democracy.
[00:41:51.167 --> 00:41:54.869]  Freedom here in the United States with a shadow government and continuity of government.
[00:41:54.889 --> 00:41:56.109]  I mean, this book covers it all.
[00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:58.790]  Well, yeah, it does.
[00:41:59.151 --> 00:42:04.393]  And yes, I wouldn't say it makes me rest easy to have put it out there.
[00:42:05.225 --> 00:42:12.450]  You know, I feel that the truth is important, and the truth is based on a lot of facts that are out there that somebody needed to put together.
[00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:18.915]  And, you know, back, I wrote two books on the Kennedy assassination, and spent a number of years researching that.
[00:42:18.975 --> 00:42:26.060]  And back in those days, in the 1970s especially, yeah, I know I was followed by the CIA and other people.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.683]  And, you know, I'm not a paranoid type of person, but this is what happened.
[00:42:30.163 --> 00:42:32.764]  You know, I should have talked more about you today while you were with us.
[00:42:32.844 --> 00:42:37.946]  I mean, yeah, you're one of the most well-researched and respected JFK researchers out there.
[00:42:38.006 --> 00:42:42.108]  I actually read one of your books something like 10 years ago.
[00:42:42.168 --> 00:42:43.268]  I'd even forgotten that.
[00:42:43.308 --> 00:42:47.810]  I mean, I knew that you were a JFK researcher and an author, but it's just you've got such a huge body of work.
[00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:54.012]  And now another book, American Conspiracies with Dick Russell, available at InfoWars.com.
[00:42:54.513 --> 00:42:54.933]  Stay with us.

[00:43:57.958 --> 00:44:01.120]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[00:44:36.957 --> 00:44:37.217]  I think so.
[00:44:56.949 --> 00:44:58.210]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:03.596]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:45:03.836 --> 00:45:08.460]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:45:08.861 --> 00:45:13.946]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:45:14.446 --> 00:45:19.131]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:45:19.631 --> 00:45:26.577]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:45:26.757 --> 00:45:27.658]  And here's the best part.
[00:45:27.878 --> 00:45:34.264]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:45:34.584 --> 00:45:37.426]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:45:37.767 --> 00:45:39.648]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:45:39.988 --> 00:45:40.909]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:45:44.542 --> 00:45:48.247]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:45:48.787 --> 00:45:53.293]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:45:53.613 --> 00:45:55.736]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:18.103]  We've got to get Dick Russell on separately for a full hour sometime just on his JFK investigation because if they're lying about 9-11, lying about JFK, lying about government drug dealing, what else are they not lying about?
[00:46:18.643 --> 00:46:20.105]  No, they're lying about basically everything.
[00:46:20.445 --> 00:46:23.508]  I mean, it's come out in government documents that I've had the army
[00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:36.512]  Watching me, Ron Paul, that they go to our events and spy on us, that Homeland Security is spying on even little churches, mainline groups, COINTELPRO that came out in the 70s.
[00:46:37.573 --> 00:46:39.873]  All of this is going on today.
[00:46:40.953 --> 00:46:46.195]  Finish up talking about some of the things that happened to you when you were writing treatises on JFK.
[00:46:48.089 --> 00:47:01.801]  Well, I had a guy named Richard Nagel who was a CIA, had been a CIA contract agent, and also worked for the Russians, and he was one of my main sources, and never told me everything he knew, but told me enough.
[00:47:03.123 --> 00:47:06.125]  It's a long story, but we can talk about it some other time on the air.
[00:47:07.395 --> 00:47:15.140]  Well, toward the end of 1995, anyway, he was found dead the very day that a subpoena from the Assassination Records Review Board appeared in his mailbox.
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:27.607]  And that shook me up a great deal, because I had just given a talk the week before that the Review Board had listened to, and then decided to subpoena him and all his records and interview him, and suddenly he's no longer with us.
[00:47:27.707 --> 00:47:31.850]  And so, things like that happening give one pause.
[00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:33.903]  Absolutely.
[00:47:34.785 --> 00:47:40.616]  In fact, we forget, what was it, 78% that Congress found a probable conspiracy?
[00:47:40.636 --> 00:47:41.418]  They said 98%, didn't they?
[00:47:43.442 --> 00:47:51.647]  Well, yeah, they came out with an official published report that there was a probable conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy, directly contradicting the Warren Commission.
[00:47:52.028 --> 00:48:06.938]  Oh, you wouldn't know that today, because, you know, Bibliosi comes out with his big book saying the Warren Commission was right, and that's the book that gets all the review attention, along with Posner's book, Conspiracy Books, quote-unquote, don't even get reviewed by the mainstream media.
[00:48:07.398 --> 00:48:09.960]  I don't think either of my books was ever given a big review.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.401]  So, you know, that's just the way it is.
[00:48:13.722 --> 00:48:20.369]  It has to happen by word of mouth, really, and people talking to their neighbors and saying, hey, you want to know the truth about what happened?
[00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:21.350]  Check this out.
[00:48:22.752 --> 00:48:30.960]  Yeah, well, you've certainly risked your life, and I'm going to ask Ventura a question Friday I've never asked him, and I'm going to ask you this now.
[00:48:31.923 --> 00:48:33.344]  On record, because I told the D.C.
[00:48:33.384 --> 00:48:37.568]  madam to do this on record on air, and she said, on record, I'll never commit suicide.
[00:48:37.888 --> 00:48:39.970]  She told her landlord, I'm being tracked.
[00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:40.931]  They may try to kill me.
[00:48:41.111 --> 00:48:41.672]  They did.
[00:48:43.093 --> 00:48:44.174]  Let's get it on record, Dick.
[00:48:44.194 --> 00:48:45.655]  You're never planning to commit suicide.
[00:48:46.516 --> 00:48:47.136]  No, I'm not.
[00:48:47.397 --> 00:48:48.257]  That's absolutely right.
[00:48:48.277 --> 00:48:49.759]  I would never plan to commit suicide.
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:56.725]  And so if they find you with a, God forbid, an empty bottle of sleeping pills, they killed you.
[00:48:59.743 --> 00:49:00.624]  I would say that's true.
[00:49:01.344 --> 00:49:02.485]  Hopefully that won't happen.
[00:49:03.185 --> 00:49:20.296]  Well, you know, reading some of the people originally involved in the JFK criminal investigation down in Louisiana, Garrison and others, they did make the point it's important on record to stay public, to stay visible, and to tell people I'm not planning to kill myself.
[00:49:20.356 --> 00:49:23.518]  And I want to say that today about Alex Jones because
[00:49:25.418 --> 00:49:29.700]  You know, it seems like 30 years ago they did pretty much kill everybody that criticized him.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.422]  Now they don't kill as many people, I think because they realize that whack-a-mole technique isn't working anymore, Dick.
[00:49:36.763 --> 00:49:37.523]  Well, that could be.
[00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:43.946]  They certainly, 30 years ago, they killed David Ferry in the Garrison investigation, and George DeMorin Shields, a supposed suicide.
[00:49:44.006 --> 00:49:53.370]  And when the House Committee was just about to interview him, and he'd been Oswald's buddy and handler, I interviewed DeMorin Shields a couple of times.
[00:49:54.474 --> 00:49:59.740]  At one point I remember his wife calling us, screaming out, well of course we know it was a vast conspiracy.
[00:50:00.301 --> 00:50:03.444]  They didn't ever elaborate, however, and he was never allowed to.
[00:50:05.206 --> 00:50:11.273]  We're about to go to break into five more minutes with you, but separately, we actually first had the audio tape inherited here.
[00:50:11.333 --> 00:50:12.914]  Rolling Stone covered the transcript.
[00:50:12.934 --> 00:50:15.778]  What do you think of E. Howard Hunt's deathbed confession?
[00:50:17.842 --> 00:50:34.010]  Um, you know, I don't really know what to make of it exactly because Howard Hunt is somebody that I never put a lot of stock in, whether he was going to be telling the truth or writing another fiction novel, which he wrote many, and he worked for the CIA for a lot of years and was certainly involved in the Watergate... Stay there!
[00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:34.611]  Gotta break!
[00:50:34.651 --> 00:50:35.091]  Gotta break!
[00:50:37.672 --> 00:50:39.033]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:39.073 --> 00:50:42.014]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:45.779 --> 00:50:50.021]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:50:50.321 --> 00:50:50.942]  Number one.
[00:50:51.242 --> 00:50:54.404]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:50:54.664 --> 00:50:55.244]  Number two.
[00:50:55.524 --> 00:51:00.087]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:00.427 --> 00:51:00.867]  It's true.
[00:51:01.167 --> 00:51:05.710]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:06.571]  Number 3.
[00:51:06.851 --> 00:51:10.134]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:10.434 --> 00:51:14.177]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:14.358 --> 00:51:14.918]  Number 4.
[00:51:15.158 --> 00:51:17.520]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:17.921 --> 00:51:21.304]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:51:21.604 --> 00:51:21.804]  Number 5.
[00:51:22.385 --> 00:51:26.308]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:51:26.529 --> 00:51:31.293]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:51:31.573 --> 00:51:35.614]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.101]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:00.683 --> 00:52:01.243]  Big Brother.
[00:52:01.954 --> 00:52:02.995]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:03.735 --> 00:52:04.816]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:05.496 --> 00:52:06.297]  You want answers?
[00:52:07.077 --> 00:52:07.958]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:07.978 --> 00:52:12.321]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:12.821 --> 00:52:16.864]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:30.112]  Well, one of the most famous and respected JFK researchers has now written several books with Jesse Ventura, Dick Russell, the new ones American Conspiracies available at Infowars.com and better bookstores everywhere.
[00:52:30.612 --> 00:52:33.576]  Already going up the top ten bestseller charts all over the place.
[00:52:34.096 --> 00:52:38.000]  But the only place you get a free documentary film with the book is at Infowars.com.
[00:52:38.341 --> 00:52:42.465]  Okay, Dick, we've got four minutes left and you've agreed to come back on just about JFK in the next few months.
[00:52:43.286 --> 00:52:46.910]  But separately, here, real quick, a few of the other chapters.
[00:52:47.691 --> 00:52:54.458]  The Wall Street Conspiracy, Chapter 13 and Chapter 14, The Secret Plans to End American Democracy.
[00:52:56.129 --> 00:52:58.250]  Yeah, well, we'll start with the Wall Street one.
[00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:10.497]  I mean, that was really doing research into just what happened a little over a year ago when the big bailout went down, and how come Goldman Sachs and AIG got away with murder, basically.
[00:53:11.838 --> 00:53:12.238]  We're good.
[00:53:29.824 --> 00:53:49.713]  To put the pieces together, which is what Governor Ventura and I tried to do with this chapter, get them to certain things that went on in the books during the Bush years, especially the continuity of government plans for martial law, something called Endgame, which, you know, again, is part of the Homeland Security
[00:53:51.283 --> 00:53:57.486]  I love these codenames, you know, Vibrant Response and Excalibur, and I wonder, you know, who's making this stuff up?
[00:53:57.706 --> 00:54:02.248]  An Endgame, End of the Republic, because that's what it spells out, an incredible book.
[00:54:02.988 --> 00:54:06.670]  Briefly, the Malcolm X chapter, amazing.
[00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:12.012]  Or the conspiracy by the CIA against Nixon.
[00:54:13.854 --> 00:54:24.490]  Yeah, well the conspiracy by the CIA against Nixon was a fascinating thing to look at because so many of the players in the Kennedy assassination come up again in the Watergate
[00:54:25.635 --> 00:54:30.319]  Well, we know he was in Dallas and it looks like his fingerprints were on it, but go ahead.
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:55:03.865]  Well, yeah, I mean he was there for a Pepsi-Cola bottlers convention and before that he worked on the CIA Mafia plot to get rid of Castro when he was in the Eisenhower administration.
[00:55:04.345 --> 00:55:09.427]  So how much, when did Nixon know, when did Nixon know, when did he know, that is very much an open question.
[00:55:09.828 --> 00:55:16.931]  But I laid out the evidence in that chapter as to how all of this seems to tie back, a lot of it anyway, to November 22, 1963.
[00:55:20.513 --> 00:55:20.713]  Lenny!
[00:55:37.311 --> 00:55:41.755]  I mean, you know, this thing was not what it was made to appear.
[00:55:42.216 --> 00:55:47.581]  Whether the Woodward-Bernstein thing is what we were led to believe, I don't know.
[00:55:47.721 --> 00:55:48.602]  I mean, deep throats.
[00:55:48.622 --> 00:55:50.924]  Well, you know the Washington Post is an organ of the CIA.
[00:55:51.084 --> 00:55:58.171]  Yeah, well, certainly they've had their ties over the years, and so have the New York Times, so have Life Magazine.
[00:55:58.211 --> 00:56:01.954]  I mean, let's be honest about it, and I lay some of that out in this new book.
[00:56:02.779 --> 00:56:04.860]  Well, Dick, we're going to have you back in the next month or so.
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:06.442]  We'll get into the Malcolm X area.
[00:56:06.462 --> 00:56:10.444]  We'll get into JFK, the murder, assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.
[00:56:10.885 --> 00:56:12.506]  Again, we only scratch the surface of the book.
[00:56:12.546 --> 00:56:14.207]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[00:56:15.328 --> 00:56:17.089]  Dick, I'm really impressed with your work.
[00:56:17.329 --> 00:56:20.231]  And again, I'm really impressed with this book.
[00:56:20.291 --> 00:56:24.534]  And all I can say is congratulations that it's shooting up towards number one.
[00:56:25.114 --> 00:56:28.997]  Just showing, again, the hunger the people have for the knowledge and the truth.
[00:56:30.199 --> 00:56:30.779]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[00:56:30.799 --> 00:56:37.442]  It's been very good to be with you today, and I hope people indeed do find something new and alternative to look at in the book.
[00:56:38.022 --> 00:56:42.904]  Let me say bye to you off-air here, because I forgot, should we give out, or do you have a website?
[00:56:43.805 --> 00:56:45.325]  Do you have a website people can visit, Dick?
[00:56:46.105 --> 00:56:48.927]  Yeah, it's dickrussell.org.
[00:56:49.067 --> 00:56:52.948]  W-W-W, Dick Russell, my full name, all one word, dot org.

[00:58:55.506 --> 00:58:59.729]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:00.670]  Number one.
[00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:04.132]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:59:04.392 --> 00:59:04.973]  Number two.
[00:59:05.253 --> 00:59:09.796]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:10.136 --> 00:59:10.596]  It's true.
[00:59:10.897 --> 00:59:15.440]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:16.301]  Number 3.
[00:59:16.581 --> 00:59:19.864]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:20.165 --> 00:59:23.909]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:24.089 --> 00:59:24.629]  Number 4.
[00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:27.252]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:27.633 --> 00:59:31.036]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:31.316 --> 00:59:31.537]  Number 5.
[00:59:32.097 --> 00:59:36.018]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:36.238 --> 00:59:40.999]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:41.299 --> 00:59:45.320]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:45.461 --> 00:59:47.041]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:47.261 --> 00:59:49.342]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:49.502 --> 00:59:51.862]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:57.279 --> 00:59:59.460]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.921]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.922 --> 01:00:12.184]  Okay, I'm going to get into some very important news right now, and then we're going to open the phones up throughout the hour.
[01:00:12.724 --> 01:00:15.125]  Jeb McGriffin is joining us next hour.
[01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:16.685]  We are live.
[01:00:16.705 --> 01:00:19.826]  It is the 10th day of March, 2010, on this Wednesday edition.
[01:00:24.912 --> 01:00:30.213]  I want to read this article, or much of it, that Paul Watson has written.
[01:00:31.473 --> 01:00:39.435]  Perversion is fine so long as you're in a position of authority, is the PrisonPlanet.com headline.
[01:00:40.015 --> 01:00:44.296]  Schools can install cameras in bathrooms and spy on kids via laptops.
[01:00:45.996 --> 01:00:52.217]  But parents treated as pedophiles for taking innocent photographs of their own children.
[01:00:54.056 --> 01:01:10.327]  Yet another story about a school installing surveillance cameras in bathrooms reminds us that while parents are treated as pedophiles for taking photographs of their own children, any perversion whatsoever is acceptable as long as it's conducted by those deemed to be in a position of authority.
[01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:13.309]  Headline, Sky Television News.
[01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:14.310]  That's Fox in England.
[01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:22.075]  Outraged parents have hit out at a school in Birmingham after pupils discovered CCTV cameras in bathroom toilets.
[01:01:23.757 --> 01:01:24.997]  And in the U.S., they're in showers.
[01:01:25.457 --> 01:01:36.180]  Youngsters at Grace Academy in Clemsley would claim they returned from half-term to find staff had installed the cameras without notifying them and their parents.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.901]  And it always comes out, well, we don't have to tell your stinking parents.
[01:01:40.461 --> 01:01:51.063]  The report points to another recent case in Britain, where a school in Salford filmed children in various stages of undress changing in their gym kit.
[01:01:52.526 --> 01:01:55.587]  And I guess that's the British word for their gym locker.
[01:01:56.928 --> 01:01:57.868]  It continues here.
[01:01:58.269 --> 01:02:04.191]  Parents slammed the move as a total invasion of privacy and many students refused to use the bathroom.
[01:02:04.211 --> 01:02:14.436]  But the school claimed that installing cameras to watch children in the most intimate setting possible was perfectly normal because children want to feel secure with the big fat perverts watching them.
[01:02:15.176 --> 01:02:19.938]  So as long as it's done in the name of safety and security, watching children in bathrooms is acceptable.
[01:02:20.158 --> 01:02:21.699]  Like the naked body scanners for everybody.
[01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:29.878]  Perhaps child molesters who are caught with kiddie porn should use the defense that they were merely watching videos of children to make them feel secure.
[01:02:30.718 --> 01:02:32.660]  But we're forgetting the golden rule.
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.922]  You're only allowed to engage in such behavior if you happen to be...
[01:02:37.037 --> 01:02:39.479]  Ascribed some position of authority.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:50.288]  We have reported on numerous cases of school officials installing cameras in school bathrooms, in the U.S., Canada, you name it, which also allow perverts to spy on children in various stages of undress.
[01:02:50.788 --> 01:03:02.798]  Compare this with the case of Kevin Garanti-Schwoon, a man who dared to take photographs of his own son in public riding a toy train at the mall.
[01:03:06.013 --> 01:03:13.623]  Sean was promptly interrupted by a security thug who accused him of being a pedophile.
[01:03:14.745 --> 01:03:21.354]  The man was then approached by a police officer and threatened with arrest for having the temerity to get upset about the situation.
[01:03:21.394 --> 01:03:23.416]  Of course, the fact that Sean
[01:03:24.904 --> 01:03:31.988]  And his son, we're simultaneously being filmed by a plethora of shopping mall CCTV cameras, is beside the point.
[01:03:32.409 --> 01:03:42.815]  Big Brother is allowed to watch us, but we can't even record our own offspring without being lectured about how we're potential child molesters by those in petty positions of authority.
[01:03:43.395 --> 01:03:46.677]  See, the message is, the entire public are a bunch of criminal scum.
[01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:47.638]  Government is good.
[01:03:48.976 --> 01:03:53.459]  And it's not just school corridors and bathrooms where kids are being spied on.
[01:03:53.719 --> 01:04:08.069]  Perhaps the most shocking aspect of the recent case in Philadelphia, and then it came out, it was everywhere else basically, where the school district issued laptop computers to 1,800 students, taxpayer paid for, according to the news.
[01:04:09.238 --> 01:04:23.610]  Across two high schools and then use concealed cameras within the machines to spy on students and their parents without their knowledge or consent when they were at home is the fact that school officials did not attempt to hide the scandal.
[01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:25.131]  They bragged about it.
[01:04:25.231 --> 01:04:26.332]  Again, they're breaking your will.
[01:04:26.932 --> 01:04:29.935]  They engage in incredible criminal activity just out in the open.
[01:04:30.635 --> 01:04:33.798]  In a PBS news clip, the assistant principal
[01:04:34.901 --> 01:04:42.365]  In the Philadelphia case, shows a reporter how, much to his own amusement, he spies on kids via their laptops and even takes pictures of them.
[01:04:43.066 --> 01:04:48.329]  And see, that's what's so incredible, is the school was bragging, I saw what you did in your bedroom last night.
[01:04:48.709 --> 01:04:50.690]  They think that's normal.
[01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:53.692]  They think we're just gonna accept, well, okay, that's fine.
[01:04:55.393 --> 01:05:01.336]  Just like Google announced four years ago, oh yeah, we're using the cameras and the microphones built into your computers to watch you and listen to you.
[01:05:01.376 --> 01:05:03.037]  They just throw it out there like it's nothing.
[01:05:06.286 --> 01:05:08.490]  I always like to mess with them and take a picture.
[01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.931]  Chuckles.
[01:05:12.698 --> 01:05:13.219]  The person.
[01:05:15.363 --> 01:05:18.409]  And it goes on, ladies and gentlemen, with the alarming spectacle.
[01:05:20.979 --> 01:05:28.164]  If a child molester had been caught installing software on laptops that enables him to watch and record children, there would be outrage.
[01:05:28.204 --> 01:05:32.747]  But again, when someone in a petty position of authority does it, it's normal and good.
[01:05:33.387 --> 01:05:44.274]  This cult-like mental illness, that anything done by an authority figure is acceptable, strikes at the very root of everything that's wrong with our society today.
[01:05:44.755 --> 01:05:49.158]  The broader argument is that schools across the Western world are now beginning to resemble
[01:05:49.758 --> 01:05:50.238]  Continuing.
[01:06:20.828 --> 01:06:32.149]  Anyone who can afford to get their children out of the school system and place them in a well-run private school, or better yet, homeschool their kids, would be insane not to do so in the current climate.
[01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:50.939]  For those who can't afford to do so, you're going to have to spend a lot of time with your children in an attempt to reverse the psychological conditioning they are being bombarded with on a daily basis in the prison camps without bars that now pass for schools in many parts of the Western world.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:53.941]  I'm going to call Watson.
[01:06:53.961 --> 01:06:55.562]  In fact, get Watson on during the break.
[01:06:55.662 --> 01:06:56.643]  Go ahead and get him on hold.
[01:06:56.663 --> 01:06:58.544]  I want to talk to him in four minutes when we go to break.
[01:06:58.824 --> 01:07:01.066]  I want him to add on here the naked body scanners.
[01:07:04.164 --> 01:07:11.030]  I want him to also add the Google watching, because I really want to promote this article and get it out to everybody, because I think it breaks down a lot of what's happening.
[01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:13.732]  And as I mentioned earlier, here's the United Nations.
[01:07:13.772 --> 01:07:15.113]  But again, they're playing the part of the good guys.
[01:07:15.413 --> 01:07:19.076]  Airport body scan breaches rights, UN expert says.
[01:07:19.116 --> 01:07:27.243]  A UN expert on Tuesday said the growing use of full body scanners in airport security was a breach of individual rights.
[01:07:32.136 --> 01:07:50.528]  Martin Schwinnon, the UN Special Rapporteur, I guess is the word, on the protection of human rights, said that in the fight against terrorism, scanners were both ineffective means of prevention and
[01:07:51.963 --> 01:07:54.164]  An excessive intrusion into individual privacy.
[01:07:54.485 --> 01:08:02.890]  The use of full-body scanners, which reveal graphic details of the human body, including the most private parts of it, very easily is a violation of human rights, he told journalists.
[01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:05.392]  It would be a violation of human rights in respect to everyone.
[01:08:05.732 --> 01:08:10.975]  But there are particular sensitivities in respect to women, certain religions, certain cultural backgrounds.
[01:08:12.336 --> 01:08:13.177]  And so it goes on.
[01:08:13.197 --> 01:08:18.460]  We got a lot of airline executives saying that they are against this as well.
[01:08:19.081 --> 01:08:19.481]  But again,
[01:08:21.067 --> 01:08:27.610]  We're going to come back from break and start taking phone calls interspersed with news throughout the rest of the hour before G. Edward Griffin joins us.
[01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:31.612]  The toll-free number to get involved with us on air here today is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:31.632 --> 01:08:31.692]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:31.712 --> 01:08:33.633]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:38.135]  Anyone who wishes to get up on air, first-time, long-time callers, whatever issue you wish to discuss, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:09:00.004]  9231.
[01:08:51.641 --> 01:09:00.004]  I want to get into some other news that we have here as well.
[01:09:00.185 --> 01:09:00.825]  In the U.S.
[01:09:01.005 --> 01:09:03.186]  and in England, we're under the same system.
[01:09:04.287 --> 01:09:07.188]  Parents' medical records go online without consent.
[01:09:07.528 --> 01:09:13.351]  Parents' confidential medical records are being placed on a controversial NHS database without their knowledge.
[01:09:13.391 --> 01:09:15.452]  Doctors and leaders have warned.
[01:09:15.732 --> 01:09:19.894]  Well, I mean, they take your baby's blood at birth and
[01:09:21.983 --> 01:09:28.547]  Don't even tell you what's happening when people like myself expose it for 14 years.
[01:09:28.588 --> 01:09:31.069]  They say we're conspiracy theorists and now it's just all admitted.
[01:09:31.449 --> 01:09:32.850]  Why are they coming out now?
[01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:34.832]  I want to ask listeners this if the callers want to comment.
[01:09:35.332 --> 01:09:37.634]  Why are they coming out now and saying we're watching you with laptops?
[01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:38.730]  I think?
[01:09:55.382 --> 01:09:57.183]  Suddenly saying they want to censor the internet.
[01:09:57.243 --> 01:10:05.710]  Why are they suddenly saying they want to force us to take microchips and first passing laws where your dogs and cats have to have them all over the country and also in England?
[01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:14.116]  Why are they openly saying they're going to put all these new taxes on us and don't seem to care that everybody in every major poll is getting extremely angry?
[01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:18.639]  We'll be discussing that as well when we come back from break 1-800-259-9231.
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:24.384]  As we go to break, I want to thank one of our sponsors for the hour, MySolar Backup.
[01:10:25.612 --> 01:10:29.813]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[01:10:29.913 --> 01:10:39.936]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:10:40.256 --> 01:10:41.077]  Here's why.
[01:10:41.417 --> 01:10:45.198]  Plug-and-play solar generators are available from our wonderful sponsors, Solutions from Science.
[01:10:45.498 --> 01:10:48.359]  These portable power systems need no insulation, supply household current,
[01:10:49.159 --> 01:10:50.700]  Where ever and whenever you need it.
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:52.341]  Producing electricity directly from the sun.
[01:10:52.742 --> 01:10:55.824]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly and emits no fumes.
[01:10:55.844 --> 01:11:01.769]  It's like having your own electrical power plant and is perfect for your home or your campsite or your shed or business or whatever.
[01:11:02.569 --> 01:11:09.935]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or you just want to get off the grid or start getting off the grid, go to mysolarbackup.com or call them and ask for a free
[01:11:10.995 --> 01:11:12.297]  Information package 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[01:11:12.497 --> 01:11:21.885]  And I do want to thank our sponsors for making the broadcast possible.
[01:11:22.605 --> 01:11:28.170]  Also, just want to tell everybody, you need to get American Conspiracies, the new book.
[01:11:30.075 --> 01:11:31.136]  It's $24.95 in hardcover.
[01:11:31.156 --> 01:11:32.036]  You get it from us, $19.95.
[01:11:33.198 --> 01:11:37.282]  And get a free film of your choice at InfoWars.com.
[01:11:37.922 --> 01:11:40.905]  And so you get a book that you can read, then give it to somebody else to wake them up.
[01:11:40.925 --> 01:11:45.029]  You get a film, you can watch and give to others, make copies of.
[01:11:46.911 --> 01:11:51.335]  Again, check it out on the online video bookstore, InfoWars.com.
[01:11:51.615 --> 01:11:53.037]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:11:53.057 --> 01:11:53.938]  With your call, stay with us.
[01:11:56.764 --> 01:12:01.051]  Rock Creek gently flows through the parkland of Washington, D.C.
[01:12:01.491 --> 01:12:05.778]  until it meets the mighty Potomac River in the heart of the federal city.

[01:12:26.433 --> 01:12:29.394]  The Creek is a completely reader-supported publication.

[01:12:52.206 --> 01:12:53.007]  Call them at 301-452-0090 today.
[01:12:56.161 --> 01:12:56.501]  Hello!
[01:12:56.821 --> 01:13:01.244]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[01:13:01.585 --> 01:13:06.088]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[01:13:06.408 --> 01:13:11.191]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[01:13:11.551 --> 01:13:15.473]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[01:13:15.633 --> 01:13:19.556]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[01:13:19.676 --> 01:13:22.217]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[01:13:22.477 --> 01:13:23.378]  It was empowering.
[01:13:23.498 --> 01:13:27.380]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.282]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[01:13:30.302 --> 01:13:33.064]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[01:13:33.164 --> 01:13:33.924]  Thank you so much.
[01:13:34.144 --> 01:13:36.926]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[01:13:37.006 --> 01:13:37.566]  Thanks again.
[01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:40.368]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[01:13:41.115 --> 01:13:44.138]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[01:13:44.538 --> 01:13:47.942]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[01:13:48.122 --> 01:13:55.329]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[01:13:57.571 --> 01:14:01.194]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:14:01.574 --> 01:14:04.577]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:14:04.817 --> 01:14:06.239]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:14:06.917 --> 01:14:09.599]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:14:09.619 --> 01:14:15.802]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:14:15.982 --> 01:14:21.525]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:14:21.545 --> 01:14:31.211]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:14:31.291 --> 01:14:33.412]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:14:33.652 --> 01:14:34.973]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:14:35.233 --> 01:14:36.114]  And the Congress is saying,
[01:14:36.474 --> 01:14:37.495]  Who do we make the check out to?
[01:14:37.676 --> 01:14:39.518]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:14:39.538 --> 01:14:44.624]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:14:44.965 --> 01:14:54.076]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:57.902]  You may be new to freeze-dry foods.
[01:14:58.122 --> 01:14:59.723]  You may have storable food questions.
[01:14:59.943 --> 01:15:04.507]  You may want to buy your freeze-dried foods from a very reputable company and not go broke in the process.
[01:15:04.808 --> 01:15:06.389]  Welcome to the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[01:15:06.569 --> 01:15:08.891]  Okay, actually, we're more than just one guy.
[01:15:09.011 --> 01:15:11.814]  We're a California-based company that's been serving our U.S.
[01:15:11.854 --> 01:15:17.599]  military and other government agencies with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:20.782]  See all about us at freeze-dryguy.com.

[01:15:27.650 --> 01:15:34.577]  Freeze dry guy foods are delicious, require little preparation, and will taste just as fresh decades from now as they do today.
[01:15:34.738 --> 01:15:36.159]  Just add hot water and serve.
[01:15:36.359 --> 01:15:41.365]  Backpackers consistently rate us number one year after year as the best tasting and ease of preparation.
[01:15:41.605 --> 01:15:43.227]  Isn't that what you want for your family?
[01:15:43.448 --> 01:15:45.690]  Visit freezedryguy.com or call 866-404-FOOD.
[01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:47.032]  That's 866-404-3663 or go to freezedryguy.com.
[01:15:47.092 --> 01:15:47.653]  Freeze Dry Guy.
[01:15:47.673 --> 01:15:48.334]  The best you can buy.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:11.804]  Alright, we're going to your phone calls, Pat, Dwayne, Brian, Terry, John, and others.
[01:16:13.906 --> 01:16:16.228]  But, Drudge Report has linked to us again.
[01:16:16.688 --> 01:16:19.450]  That will pull up the actual Drudge Report and show people a shot of that.
[01:16:19.831 --> 01:16:20.571]  Drudge Report.
[01:16:21.192 --> 01:16:25.235]  Malware accusation coincides with cyber security agenda.
[01:16:26.857 --> 01:16:33.102]  And, again, the Sergeant of Arms has now admitted, and I'm going to have a note added up here, that this was all a lie.
[01:16:34.087 --> 01:16:37.610]  That they were just told that there was malware on it and it's not on the Drudge Report.
[01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:39.051]  It's just not true.
[01:16:40.592 --> 01:16:42.034]  And this is the same thing.
[01:16:42.974 --> 01:16:52.242]  Companies, businesses, governments, universities, high schools pay for these databases that have tens of thousands of internet sites' names in them.
[01:16:52.763 --> 01:16:56.205]  And InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com is in almost all of these.
[01:16:56.974 --> 01:17:06.341]  And that's why in colleges and companies and public schools and now on government-issued Wi-Fi that is used in many cities, you can't get to our websites.
[01:17:06.762 --> 01:17:15.709]  Because we've been listed as hate, as extremism, as malware, as porn, as hacking sites.
[01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:18.311]  There's nothing about how to hack on our sites.
[01:17:18.631 --> 01:17:24.116]  There's not even bare-breasted women on our sites, unless it's a photo of the news and naked body scanners.
[01:17:25.176 --> 01:17:29.798]  There is no hate, but even, I mean, what is the definition of hate?
[01:17:29.818 --> 01:17:30.839]  It's whatever they want it to be.
[01:17:31.559 --> 01:17:37.342]  But, again, first they censor Nazis, who people don't like, and then they can censor everybody.
[01:17:38.222 --> 01:17:41.284]  This is how they operate.
[01:17:42.588 --> 01:17:45.970]  This is how they get their job done.
[01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:48.571]  And they're now doing it to the Drudge Report.
[01:17:49.211 --> 01:17:53.493]  I mean, if they can do it to the Drudge Report, the biggest news site in the world.
[01:17:54.234 --> 01:17:55.574]  The biggest news site.
[01:17:55.594 --> 01:18:02.457]  I mean, in every radio station I've worked in, when I'm in other news organizations that are interviewing me, you see Drudge Report on computers.
[01:18:03.138 --> 01:18:04.739]  I mean, everybody checks the Drudge Report.
[01:18:06.823 --> 01:18:08.264]  He mainly links to mainstream news.
[01:18:08.304 --> 01:18:09.946]  He does link to PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:18:10.306 --> 01:18:12.428]  He does have a permanent link to InfoWars.com.
[01:18:12.749 --> 01:18:14.110]  He's linking to us every week now.
[01:18:14.150 --> 01:18:15.692]  We really appreciate the mega-traffic.
[01:18:16.252 --> 01:18:18.234]  As if Prison Planet wasn't growing fast enough.
[01:18:19.015 --> 01:18:20.096]  Very, very exciting.
[01:18:20.156 --> 01:18:20.817]  Drudge Report.
[01:18:21.237 --> 01:18:25.861]  Malware accusation coincides with cyber security agenda.
[01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:28.844]  And I'll be playing a clip of Senator Inhofe talking about this.
[01:18:29.725 --> 01:18:34.729]  Before the hour ends, but this is a big, big issue.
[01:18:35.370 --> 01:18:38.753]  And we have the White House with Cass Sunstein calling for more and more censorship.
[01:18:39.013 --> 01:18:42.356]  We'll probably beef, because Kurt writes four or five great articles a day.
[01:18:42.376 --> 01:18:45.618]  He's a workhorse, does a great job, but now this article is getting so much attention.
[01:18:45.939 --> 01:18:52.804]  Watson, on the Drudge Linked one, is going to add another article at the bottom about the wider agenda, Cass Sunstein, these web filters, and things that are going on.
[01:18:53.525 --> 01:18:54.826]  Pat in California.
[01:18:54.886 --> 01:18:55.707]  Pat, you're on the air.
[01:18:56.644 --> 01:19:01.027]  Yeah, hey Alex, what I think is they're basically on the run to push whatever they can.
[01:19:01.087 --> 01:19:05.310]  Now Obama's talking about, let me see, giving amnesty to all the illegals.
[01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:08.072]  But I just want to ask a quick question, I'll get off.
[01:19:08.232 --> 01:19:16.998]  HR 875, the food bill, which no one's paying attention to, is that where the executive order for Obama is to stop the fishing?
[01:19:17.238 --> 01:19:20.160]  Which I think people should be really aware about the fishing aspect.
[01:19:20.541 --> 01:19:21.681]  I'll let you answer and I've got to go.
[01:19:21.741 --> 01:19:22.382]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:19:22.662 --> 01:19:23.062]  Thank you.
[01:19:23.363 --> 01:19:25.764]  I've got that bill number here.
[01:19:26.245 --> 01:19:27.525]  I can't remember it from memory.
[01:19:27.545 --> 01:19:28.626]  It was ESPN.
[01:19:29.727 --> 01:19:30.768]  No, no, that wasn't a bill.
[01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:32.008]  That was an executive order.
[01:19:32.489 --> 01:19:36.171]  But it doesn't have the executive order number in the article, but I've seen the executive order.
[01:19:36.211 --> 01:19:38.153]  We printed it off yesterday.
[01:19:38.213 --> 01:19:39.414]  It's in one of these stacks.
[01:19:40.374 --> 01:19:43.956]  Give me a wide, this is only one week of news here, I've got to clean the desk.
[01:19:44.337 --> 01:19:51.421]  Give me a wide document cam shot so people can get an idea of just how insane, this is one week of news and information.
[01:19:52.122 --> 01:20:00.087]  But I don't have that executive order in front of me, but it would put federal restrictions on all fishing, including angling and streams and rivers and lakes.
[01:20:00.727 --> 01:20:06.811]  That's on record, that's what the World Wildlife Fund, who sponsored his executive order, who pushed him to do it, says it's for.
[01:20:09.032 --> 01:20:18.134]  Separately, Natural News and others, who are great sources, have reported that the McCain supplement bill is dead.
[01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:20.154]  And we did cover that bill in the last month.
[01:20:21.295 --> 01:20:23.295]  That mirrors the Codex Alimentarius.
[01:20:23.375 --> 01:20:33.637]  See, they agree at the UN level on carbon taxes, or restricting vitamins and minerals, or on environmental rules, or on military rules, or terrorism rules, or surveillance rules.
[01:20:33.957 --> 01:20:36.978]  And then they get the nation states to pass corresponding laws.
[01:20:37.658 --> 01:20:43.003]  But no, I don't have the McCain bill number in front of me either, but that's on record that it does that.
[01:20:43.264 --> 01:20:59.419]  Canada, without even passing a law, just put the regulation in effect last month, and that was the headline in the Toronto Star, that pharmacies and health food stores told not to sell supplements, period, that aren't approved by the government.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:04.942]  And so there's, I mean, it's just an absolutely incredible announcement that this is happening.
[01:21:05.662 --> 01:21:06.362]  Let's go ahead.
[01:21:06.562 --> 01:21:07.363]  Well, we're gonna go to break.
[01:21:07.383 --> 01:21:10.324]  We'll come back with Dwayne, Brian, Terry, John and others.
[01:21:10.984 --> 01:21:12.524]  The toll-free number to join us again is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:21:16.906 --> 01:21:28.511]  But great job to Kurt Nemo, writing another powerful story that was posted over at PrisonPlanet.com, dealing with the demonization program against Matt Drudge.
[01:21:28.911 --> 01:21:34.173]  Drudge's report, malware accusation coincides with cyber security agenda.
[01:21:35.373 --> 01:21:38.094]  And you know, Drudge has started linking to us in the last three, four months.
[01:21:38.234 --> 01:21:42.576]  I was saying he's been doing a great job the last year, exposing the world government, the new world order.
[01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:44.717]  He's the best mainline guy out there.
[01:21:46.676 --> 01:21:49.678]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:50.599 --> 01:21:53.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:55.882 --> 01:21:56.862]  What's your home worth?
[01:21:57.043 --> 01:21:58.984]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:21:59.144 --> 01:22:01.886]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:22:02.186 --> 01:22:09.711]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[01:22:09.911 --> 01:22:13.333]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[01:22:55.503 --> 01:22:58.225]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.

[01:23:12.814 --> 01:23:18.940]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:21.142]  That's buy three, get one free.
[01:23:21.343 --> 01:23:24.065]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[01:23:24.245 --> 01:23:31.813]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[01:23:32.213 --> 01:23:35.095]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[01:23:35.115 --> 01:23:36.336]  Another example?
[01:23:36.556 --> 01:23:39.598]  Buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[01:23:39.738 --> 01:23:44.881]  You've got to go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[01:23:44.901 --> 01:23:45.641]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[01:23:45.701 --> 01:23:46.742]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[01:23:55.708 --> 01:24:01.049]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:24:02.289 --> 01:24:07.051]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:24:07.431 --> 01:24:14.212]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:24:16.153 --> 01:24:18.373]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:24:20.213 --> 01:24:22.174]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:24:24.642 --> 01:24:28.545]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:24:29.266 --> 01:24:32.408]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:24:33.089 --> 01:24:33.890]  Others don't.
[01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:36.211]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:24:36.472 --> 01:24:37.973]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:24:38.253 --> 01:24:40.815]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:24:41.135 --> 01:24:47.401]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:24:47.761 --> 01:24:49.963]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:24:50.463 --> 01:24:52.505]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[01:24:52.825 --> 01:24:53.666]  Others don't.
[01:25:08.886 --> 01:25:16.418]  Okay, I'm going to Pat, Dwayne, Brian, Terry, John, and many others here in just a moment.
[01:25:19.013 --> 01:25:23.154]  But I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up because I don't really pay attention to the affiliates we're on.
[01:25:23.174 --> 01:25:24.835]  I know it's growing by leaps and bounds.
[01:25:25.355 --> 01:25:27.255]  A lot of big 50,000 watt AMs.
[01:25:27.955 --> 01:25:30.076]  100,000 watt FM starting to pick us up.
[01:25:30.096 --> 01:25:31.576]  A lot of little stations as well.
[01:25:31.616 --> 01:25:33.937]  They're all precious because we reach out to people.
[01:25:34.497 --> 01:25:44.600]  But I don't know, it was about a year ago I got a call by what the vice president of XM who just wanted to talk to me before they tested the show out and put three hours of the Friday show on Saturdays.
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:46.000]  And I have
[01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:47.990]  We're good.
[01:26:04.728 --> 01:26:21.568]  I have Sirius, owned by the same company, but last night I actually went over to a friend's house who has XM, sat there, tuned it in, listened to it, and while I was listening to it, Ted called up, because I asked him to get to the bottom of this, and he said, I'm in my car, I got an XM membership, here you are, and I said, no, I'm already listening.
[01:26:22.188 --> 01:26:25.790]  So that's the level of the disinformation against this program.
[01:26:26.410 --> 01:26:28.691]  People just go out and say everything we say is a lie.
[01:26:28.751 --> 01:26:29.731]  We are on XM.
[01:26:30.011 --> 01:26:31.292]  Not that it's even that big of a deal.
[01:26:31.312 --> 01:26:31.932]  We're thankful.
[01:26:32.352 --> 01:26:32.892]  We like it.
[01:26:33.433 --> 01:26:34.093]  It's exciting.
[01:26:34.133 --> 01:26:37.114]  It shows the mainstream knows that our time has come.
[01:26:37.134 --> 01:26:38.595]  This information can't be stopped.
[01:26:38.915 --> 01:26:40.756]  That's why they're letting Ventura on television.
[01:26:40.796 --> 01:26:43.737]  That's why all this is happening because all the polls show
[01:26:44.622 --> 01:26:47.225]  But upwards of 90% believe the government killed Kennedy.
[01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:52.992]  Upwards of 84% in a New York Times Angus and Reed poll believe the official story of 9-11 is a lie.
[01:26:53.233 --> 01:26:54.814]  The lowest poll is 36%.
[01:26:55.215 --> 01:26:56.817]  Let's say 36% believe that.
[01:26:57.177 --> 01:27:00.441]  I mean, you know, the system knows they can't cover this up anymore.
[01:27:01.903 --> 01:27:05.065]  They're not putting me on 400 stations like Glenn Beck or 600 like Limbaugh.
[01:27:05.826 --> 01:27:17.134]  But the point is, they are testing the waters, so people should get the XM subscription so they can listen, so that the market shows people want that, so all four hours go on.
[01:27:17.374 --> 01:27:22.598]  So I briefly wanted to bring Ted Anderson on, that yes, this radio show is on XM.
[01:27:22.638 --> 01:27:23.198]  Ted Anderson.
[01:27:23.679 --> 01:27:24.459]  Yeah, it sure is.
[01:27:24.779 --> 01:27:28.262]  Monday through Friday on Channel 158, I tuned it in last night.
[01:27:28.877 --> 01:27:32.061]  It was on from 8 o'clock to 9 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[01:27:32.681 --> 01:27:36.706]  And then on Saturdays, it comes on on Channel 165.
[01:27:37.326 --> 01:27:41.311]  And that's on from 5 o'clock Central Time till 8 o'clock Central Time.
[01:27:41.891 --> 01:27:43.773]  They don't have you up on the schedule yet.
[01:27:43.813 --> 01:27:45.555]  It still says Bruce Williams up there.
[01:27:45.575 --> 01:27:47.838]  When Bruce retired, they put you in there.
[01:27:48.707 --> 01:27:52.249]  Um, that will be changed very soon, because we're working real closely with them.
[01:27:52.589 --> 01:27:54.710]  They have to get into their, you know, do their internet thing.
[01:27:54.730 --> 01:28:00.113]  Now, Brannigan said last week he thought they were going to change the channel on the Saturday show, too.
[01:28:00.433 --> 01:28:02.294]  So that may cause the confusion as well.
[01:28:02.614 --> 01:28:02.975]  It could.
[01:28:03.055 --> 01:28:05.236]  If that does happen, that could cause some confusion.
[01:28:05.276 --> 01:28:10.238]  But right now, at this point in time, it shows on the schedule that you're on 165 on Saturday, so...
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.901]  Well, I'll keep you posted on that and let you know.
[01:28:13.921 --> 01:28:23.404]  But yeah, indeed, that's another testimonial, a feather in the cap, if you will, as to show people how well the Alex Jones Show is doing.
[01:28:23.424 --> 01:28:29.327]  Yeah, because they pick up a lot of lesser interesting shows that give variety and different news angles.
[01:28:30.527 --> 01:28:43.498]  I mean, for them to pick up my show, which is seen as the most radical and the most dangerous and, oh my gosh, I mean, you talk about how you talk to some of the big networks and big station owners and they go, yes, we know Alex Jones gets ratings.
[01:28:43.798 --> 01:28:45.439]  We know he's a powerful talk show host.
[01:28:45.779 --> 01:28:49.302]  But, you know, this guy is just too radical.
[01:28:50.223 --> 01:28:51.664]  That's the problem.
[01:28:51.784 --> 01:28:54.967]  I mean, I've been running into that ever since I've been producing your show.
[01:28:55.789 --> 01:29:00.792]  And I gotta tell you, Alex, it makes me darn proud to be able to stand by you like we have.
[01:29:01.793 --> 01:29:02.133]  I do.
[01:29:02.213 --> 01:29:03.694]  I run into a block wall.
[01:29:04.234 --> 01:29:05.775]  KSTP was one of them.
[01:29:06.455 --> 01:29:07.436]  They sell airtime.
[01:29:07.576 --> 01:29:08.817]  I said, good, let me buy it on.
[01:29:08.837 --> 01:29:09.517]  Who's the show?
[01:29:09.757 --> 01:29:10.498]  That's right.
[01:29:10.918 --> 01:29:15.461]  Usually we don't pay for airtime, but just as a test, they wouldn't even let you pay to put me on.
[01:29:15.641 --> 01:29:16.541]  No, exactly.
[01:29:16.581 --> 01:29:17.682]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:29:17.702 --> 01:29:20.003]  I mean, just absolute block wall.
[01:29:21.304 --> 01:29:22.445]  Not that it really matters that much anymore.
[01:29:22.465 --> 01:29:24.627]  Because we don't pay to be on XM to be clear, yeah.
[01:29:24.907 --> 01:29:33.915]  I mean, the internet has grown to be such a great, valuable tool for a delivery mechanism for shows like yours that it's, you know...
[01:29:34.724 --> 01:29:36.845]  The terrestrial radio is dying.
[01:29:36.865 --> 01:29:55.218]  I mean, I watch the Clear Channel station here locally, and they've actually got a conglomerate of seven different stations here in Minneapolis, and they've had to reduce the size of their staff and get out of leasing space, and it's just shrinking on them.
[01:29:55.758 --> 01:29:56.579]  Well, we're growing.
[01:29:57.039 --> 01:30:07.484]  So that just tells you what's going on, and I think there's going to be more and more of these stations that will buckle, and they'll take your show, and finally the people of the United States will get the truth.
[01:30:07.764 --> 01:30:08.625]  And that's what matters.
[01:30:09.671 --> 01:30:14.095]  Absolutely, because what we talk about is becoming so mainstream out there.
[01:30:14.115 --> 01:30:26.344]  I mean, look at Ventura, the number one show on TruTV, beat out all the other cable news channels except for Fox, showing that the people are hungry for alternative information.
[01:30:26.584 --> 01:30:29.667]  Now, Ted, I want to go to calls, and I don't want to hold you too much longer, but briefly,
[01:30:30.367 --> 01:30:34.889]  Gold has, you know, in the last month been up, what, over $70.
[01:30:35.309 --> 01:30:36.790]  It's been holding around that range.
[01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:45.073]  And you still have some great deals on gold and silver that you bought at the previous lower price, when it was down at about $1,055 an ounce.
[01:30:45.353 --> 01:30:53.837]  And you've got a free international news, a free international forecaster newsletter that you're offering with that franc.
[01:30:53.877 --> 01:30:54.997]  Tell folks briefly about that.
[01:30:55.237 --> 01:30:56.458]  Yeah, that's the franc at $261.61.
[01:31:00.051 --> 01:31:01.814]  That is such a deal, Alex.
[01:31:01.935 --> 01:31:09.629]  I mean, if you take the $159 that it cost to buy that subscription for a year off of that price, we're at about $520 an ounce for gold.
[01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:19.936]  And you know, I mean, everybody knows that you'd have to turn the clock back 10 years to be able to buy gold at $520 an ounce.
[01:31:20.357 --> 01:31:31.760]  So if you haven't taken advantage of that, if you didn't hear about this deal, call us at 1-800-686-2237 and do it, because you're just not going to get a better deal on gold than that.
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.641]  The British Sovereigns are at $318.
[01:31:33.921 --> 01:31:34.921]  They're a good buy, too.
[01:31:36.221 --> 01:31:39.042]  The $20 Liberty, I have them at $1,363 right now.
[01:31:39.422 --> 01:31:40.923]  I'm going to be able to hold them for a little bit.
[01:31:41.483 --> 01:31:43.444]  They are at $1,400 normally.
[01:31:43.484 --> 01:31:46.405]  I mean, now I have got them on my regular sheet.
[01:31:46.825 --> 01:31:49.166]  They're about $1,450.
[01:31:49.246 --> 01:31:52.488]  So $1,363 for a $20 Liberty is really a steal, too.
[01:31:52.508 --> 01:32:00.011]  So if you're looking for something like that, the Montana Silver Rounds, Lakotas, you know, I picked up a lot of that stuff.
[01:32:00.051 --> 01:32:01.672]  The prices shot up like you said it did.
[01:32:01.692 --> 01:32:03.673]  We've seen $1,123 today, and we've seen as low as $1,101.
[01:32:07.615 --> 01:32:12.957]  But, wide fluctuating day, but I can tell you right now, I think the verdict is pretty well up.
[01:32:13.317 --> 01:32:23.300]  Everybody in the entire United States knows that we're in trouble, and gold is a way better idea than sitting on paper investments and fiat currency, that's for sure.
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:24.561]  Absolutely.
[01:32:24.621 --> 01:32:26.582]  And when you call the brokers, just tell them what you want.
[01:32:26.622 --> 01:32:29.664]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones Special and it's as easy as kiss my hand.
[01:32:29.944 --> 01:32:34.507]  Whether you want the free digital year subscription or the hard copy, mail to your door.
[01:32:34.527 --> 01:32:36.148]  The International Forecaster and valuable.
[01:32:36.168 --> 01:32:36.488]  800-686-2237.
[01:32:36.508 --> 01:32:36.548]  800-686-2237.
[01:32:44.233 --> 01:32:45.974]  Or MidasResources.com.
[01:32:46.434 --> 01:32:48.975]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, it's the Alex Jones Specials 800-686-2237.
[01:32:48.995 --> 01:32:52.737]  Ted, thanks for all your support getting the truth out.
[01:32:53.037 --> 01:32:53.977]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:32:54.417 --> 01:32:54.758]  You bet.
[01:32:54.778 --> 01:32:55.718]  There goes Ted Anderson.
[01:32:56.198 --> 01:32:57.859]  Okay, I already talked to Pat, didn't I, John?
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:02.381]  Okay, let's talk to Duane.
[01:33:03.301 --> 01:33:04.161]  Is that who's up next?
[01:33:05.522 --> 01:33:06.622]  Duane in California.
[01:33:06.643 --> 01:33:07.243]  Thanks for holding.
[01:33:08.403 --> 01:33:08.783]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:33:08.803 --> 01:33:09.784]  It's nice to talk to you.
[01:33:11.064 --> 01:33:12.165]  I've called you once before.
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:31.413]  Regarding the swine flu issue, I happened to mention, I saw Jesse Ventura the other night on Larry King, and it was interesting, Larry King was trying to talk Jesse Ventura into reneging on some of his, or going back on some of his issues, and Jesse Ventura wouldn't fall for it.
[01:33:32.154 --> 01:33:42.241]  But additionally, I wanted to talk about some of the issues you brought up, like why are these things happening, like the internet censor, the health care, cameras everywhere, police towers,
[01:33:42.893 --> 01:33:57.405]  I don't know how you feel about this, but my issue is that I think the Obama administration and previous, Clinton, Bush, and the others, have just felt that the American people are going to roll over too easily.
[01:33:57.545 --> 01:34:02.289]  And I think they're trying to intimidate us into just accepting this information without
[01:34:03.090 --> 01:34:08.637]  And they're training us incrementally to accept more and more.
[01:34:08.677 --> 01:34:09.538]  I totally agree with you.
[01:34:09.879 --> 01:34:12.382]  I didn't have a chance to watch all the Larry King.
[01:34:12.422 --> 01:34:14.705]  I watched, it's like 30 minutes long, I watched like 10 minutes.
[01:34:15.646 --> 01:34:20.332]  How was he trying to get Ventura to renege on things, being specific?
[01:34:21.249 --> 01:34:28.296]  Well, he was going back to Jesse Ventura's book, and he was taking out excerpts and saying, well, how do you feel about this issue?
[01:34:28.956 --> 01:34:35.543]  And don't you think that, oh, maybe the health scare was overrated and Jesse wouldn't fall for it?
[01:34:35.583 --> 01:34:36.363]  And he said, no.
[01:34:36.403 --> 01:34:38.986]  I said, this is all government propaganda and a hoax.
[01:34:39.867 --> 01:34:42.049]  And he wouldn't fall for Larry King's jibes.
[01:34:42.289 --> 01:34:44.011]  Oh, he was saying the swine flu was a hoax.
[01:34:44.758 --> 01:34:44.998]  Yeah.
[01:34:45.638 --> 01:34:45.798]  Yes.
[01:34:46.319 --> 01:34:46.799]  Absolutely.
[01:34:46.859 --> 01:34:47.419]  That's the thing.
[01:34:47.499 --> 01:34:51.081]  Ventura, when I first met him four years ago, was somewhat informed.
[01:34:51.661 --> 01:34:54.202]  But now, I know him really well and spent a lot of time with him.
[01:34:54.282 --> 01:34:55.623]  He really knows what he's doing.
[01:34:55.643 --> 01:34:57.024]  He's really learning fast.
[01:34:57.484 --> 01:34:59.005]  And he's such a prominent figure.
[01:34:59.665 --> 01:35:03.287]  And he gets on all these big TV shows and he's just doing a lot of good.
[01:35:04.087 --> 01:35:05.428]  I disagree with a few issues.
[01:35:06.528 --> 01:35:09.070]  Legalizing the illegals, because I know that's part of the globalist plan.
[01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:10.771]  He thinks it's just a freedom issue.
[01:35:11.351 --> 01:35:17.215]  I disagree with him on, you know, I mean, you heard his co-author still believes in man-made global warming, but we woke Jesse up about that.
[01:35:17.536 --> 01:35:18.776]  So very exciting, Dwayne.
[01:35:18.796 --> 01:35:19.457]  Thanks for the call.
[01:35:19.817 --> 01:35:21.718]  Terry in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:35:22.739 --> 01:35:23.279]  Hey, Alex.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:24.140]  Hey, buddy.
[01:35:25.441 --> 01:35:26.362]  Man, enjoy your show.
[01:35:26.582 --> 01:35:29.404]  I have two questions about the body scanners.
[01:35:30.164 --> 01:35:30.845]  First question is,
[01:35:32.064 --> 01:35:34.965]  Is it mandatory or can you opt for a pat-down?
[01:35:35.185 --> 01:35:39.627]  Second question is, do we have a list of the airports that are using these things?
[01:35:42.148 --> 01:35:42.508]  Okay.
[01:35:44.349 --> 01:35:47.970]  In England, first they said it'd be voluntary, now it's mandatory.
[01:35:48.651 --> 01:35:49.431]  Same thing here.
[01:35:49.491 --> 01:35:53.813]  They're now saying at first it'll be... Let me flip that around.
[01:35:54.073 --> 01:35:57.814]  First they say it's voluntary, then they say it becomes mandatory.
[01:35:58.414 --> 01:35:59.635]  England has already done that.
[01:36:01.545 --> 01:36:01.785]  And it's
[01:36:18.647 --> 01:36:18.947]  Oh, what?
[01:36:18.987 --> 01:36:23.351]  Three, four years ago, they put in some body scanners at a few airports around the country.
[01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:25.352]  Boston, Logan, and a few others.
[01:36:26.113 --> 01:36:37.121]  Then they, a year and a half ago, ordered several billion dollars worth and announced 100 plus airports, then 214 airports would be getting them.
[01:36:37.462 --> 01:36:42.225]  But then, you may have at an airport 10 or 15, 20 terminals in some cases.
[01:36:42.766 --> 01:36:44.487]  Only a few of the terminals got them.
[01:36:46.874 --> 01:36:49.036]  I think it's more than 40 airports have now put them in.
[01:36:49.076 --> 01:36:50.357]  Last number I saw last week.
[01:36:50.877 --> 01:36:59.043]  Now they're talking about, you know, you see headlines, uh, you know, 11 more airports get it and another article, 16 more get it.
[01:36:59.463 --> 01:37:05.327]  But they intend to put them in 200, that's the Homeland Security report, 214 airports.
[01:37:05.347 --> 01:37:06.608]  That's an airport of any size.
[01:37:07.209 --> 01:37:10.491]  And in the first wave, they just want to get them in the 214 at one or two of the terminals.
[01:37:14.184 --> 01:37:16.646]  By terminal, I mean security checkpoint at that terminal.
[01:37:18.086 --> 01:37:19.307]  Like, take Austin-Bergstrom.
[01:37:19.327 --> 01:37:21.429]  I think they only have, what, three security checkpoints?
[01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:23.870]  But then you go to something like Chicago?
[01:37:23.890 --> 01:37:28.313]  I mean, I don't know how many Chicago has, but it's a giant labyrinth.
[01:37:29.253 --> 01:37:30.454]  Same thing with LAX.
[01:37:30.514 --> 01:37:31.835]  Same thing with JFK.
[01:37:32.515 --> 01:37:35.317]  I mean, these are just huge, huge, huge facilities.
[01:37:36.378 --> 01:37:42.822]  But no, they do intend to put them in all major airports, and now because of Joe Stack flying into the building, they were already calling for it,
[01:37:43.502 --> 01:37:44.503]  But now they're really pushing it.
[01:37:44.804 --> 01:37:46.766]  They want body scanners.
[01:37:47.126 --> 01:37:50.130]  Well, first metal detectors, then body scanners at small airports.
[01:37:50.150 --> 01:37:50.951]  That'll bankrupt them.
[01:37:51.251 --> 01:37:58.640]  You got 15 little planes, you know, that people can barely pay for at some little tiny runway outside Austin or outside wherever you live.
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:37:59.921]  They won't be able to pay for it.
[01:38:00.201 --> 01:38:03.765]  They want general aviation, private pilots or charter jets.
[01:38:04.406 --> 01:38:07.408]  At the airports, the bigger ones to make you go through it.
[01:38:07.728 --> 01:38:12.492]  They want to put them in all the federal courthouses and have put them in quite a few courthouses in the U.S.
[01:38:12.532 --> 01:38:14.353]  The first being Denver, but we learned it was more.
[01:38:14.853 --> 01:38:28.963]  Now they've got mobile Homeland Security trucks with brain scanners, body scanners, x-rays that they're going to herd people through at highway checkpoints and at shopping malls and at football events and at concerts.
[01:38:29.003 --> 01:38:33.266]  Did you see me or hear me play that Homeland Security video clip on Monday?
[01:38:34.630 --> 01:38:35.251]  No, I missed it.
[01:38:35.891 --> 01:38:38.553]  Well, there was an article written about it at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:38:38.573 --> 01:38:41.574]  The point is, this is going to be everywhere and they've announced it.
[01:38:41.894 --> 01:38:43.495]  I appreciate your call.
[01:38:44.136 --> 01:38:47.318]  Let's go ahead and jam in another call here.
[01:38:48.238 --> 01:38:52.360]  Let's talk to John in Ohio.
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:52.981]  You're on the air.
[01:38:53.001 --> 01:38:54.702]  Yes, Alex.
[01:38:54.802 --> 01:38:59.865]  I heard part of the Dick Russell interview there and I wanted to make a few points.
[01:39:00.949 --> 01:39:04.791]  Towards the end there, before it was cut off, he was talking about E. Howard Hunt.
[01:39:05.411 --> 01:39:15.556]  And here you have a smoking gun deathbed confession of always the leading candidate for being sort of the on-the-spot field operative for the Kennedy assassination.
[01:39:15.596 --> 01:39:18.057]  He ran assassinations worldwide on record.
[01:39:18.658 --> 01:39:19.458]  Right, exactly.
[01:39:19.598 --> 01:39:25.801]  And because he wrote some fictional books, that's the stock and trade of the CIA, is to lie
[01:39:26.511 --> 01:39:31.275]  Uh, when you have witness against self-filth, that's totally different than the lies that the CIA tells.
[01:39:31.295 --> 01:39:38.160]  Yeah, that's like Ian Fleming of MI5, well it was MI6, he was OSS before that, wrote the James Bond novels.
[01:39:38.861 --> 01:39:54.573]  Right, I mean, if you look at Operation Mockingbird, how the CIA, if you look at, Google that up, people can see how all of the media, all of the leading networks, all of the media, New York Times, Washington Post, the rest of it, completely collaborated with the CIA in framing up the Soviet Union for
[01:39:55.034 --> 01:39:55.354]  I think so.
[01:40:08.426 --> 01:40:12.629]  Iraq, Iran, Venezuela, they're involved in conspiracies.
[01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:13.650]  You better believe it.
[01:40:13.690 --> 01:40:23.598]  But if you say an element within the secret government in this country is involved in it, well, we'll have a nice, handy, psychiatric pathological... Yeah, that's like Iran and Iraq.
[01:40:23.638 --> 01:40:34.286]  They said they have secret WMD programs, and then it turned out it was all lies, but that's a real conspiracy theory, but then that's okay, but then you have
[01:40:34.966 --> 01:40:35.866]  Well, here's an example.
[01:40:36.067 --> 01:40:38.668]  I was on CBC yesterday.
[01:40:38.688 --> 01:40:39.988]  They actually aired it today.
[01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:41.769]  They said they were airing it today.
[01:40:41.789 --> 01:40:45.271]  Let's go pull up that guy's show on the CBC and see if it did air, guys.
[01:40:45.471 --> 01:40:45.751]  Please.
[01:40:46.852 --> 01:40:53.295]  And I talked about the White House memo, the Downing Street memo, how
[01:40:55.030 --> 01:41:09.561]  It's admitted, the government admits that they lied about the WMDs, fixed the intelligence around the war, that they knew that Saddam didn't have them, and they had another guy come on after I was on, because I could hear it on the ISDN line, they didn't disconnect it, and say I made that up.
[01:41:10.681 --> 01:41:16.125]  Again, they call you a conspiracy theorist for saying that they lied about WMDs, John.
[01:41:17.967 --> 01:41:22.490]  Yeah, and the other thing that Dick was talking about was he was surprised that Huffington Post
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.421]  Was I doing a job on it?
[01:41:24.781 --> 01:41:39.426]  If you look back to the history of this, of the CIA's propaganda, they always loved to use up fake liberal fronts, fake liberal magazines and others as an excuse for their Cold War anti-communist, anti-Soviet propaganda because it would be more believable.
[01:41:39.846 --> 01:41:49.190]  And even more than the right-wing, the New Republic and many others were secretly collaborating with the CIA to frame up us into the Vietnam War.
[01:41:49.630 --> 01:41:52.111]  So what I'm getting at is that I think that
[01:41:53.478 --> 01:41:54.679]  He's a little naive.
[01:41:54.719 --> 01:42:12.489]  Things like NPR somehow have this reputation that they're an alternative to CNN and Fox, when actually the head of all CIA foreign propaganda, radio propaganda, Kevin Close, was for many, many years the head of, a chairman of NPR.
[01:42:12.509 --> 01:42:21.294]  They just tell the same war mongering, ram bashing, rat bashing lies in a softer, sucker mom voice to make it sound somehow more moderate.
[01:42:21.858 --> 01:42:32.195]  I think that people have got to get rid of this broad branding because I think Colin Powell asserted that he was depicted as a moderate.
[01:42:32.275 --> 01:42:33.577]  He lied his teeth off.
[01:42:34.039 --> 01:42:35.420]  Oh, I mean Obama is just Bush 3.
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:36.800]  Alright, great points.
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:37.921]  I appreciate your call.
[01:42:38.561 --> 01:42:41.623]  But at the same time, the Soviets had all their disinformation and propaganda as well.
[01:42:41.663 --> 01:42:42.543]  Let's be fair about that.
[01:42:42.623 --> 01:42:43.543]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:56.875 --> 01:43:00.239]  You just might be only a few meals away from anarchy.
[01:43:00.499 --> 01:43:03.523]  Look at the recent world events and even the economic crisis.
[01:43:03.743 --> 01:43:07.067]  The time to prepare yourself and your family is now.
[01:43:07.327 --> 01:43:07.648]  Now.
[01:43:07.908 --> 01:43:08.188]  Now.
[01:43:08.208 --> 01:43:14.956]  For one week only, Readymade Resources offers all GCN listeners 25% off on all Mountain House case lots.

[01:43:57.236 --> 01:44:00.904]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:44:01.265 --> 01:44:04.271]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:04.512 --> 01:44:05.935]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:44:06.624 --> 01:44:09.286]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:09.306 --> 01:44:15.510]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:15.690 --> 01:44:20.693]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:21.233 --> 01:44:30.859]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:30.979 --> 01:44:33.081]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:33.321 --> 01:44:34.642]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:34.923 --> 01:44:37.185]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:37.365 --> 01:44:39.226]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:39.507 --> 01:44:44.331]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:44.651 --> 01:44:49.415]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:44:56.078 --> 01:45:01.824]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[01:45:01.904 --> 01:45:06.950]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[01:45:07.130 --> 01:45:09.793]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[01:45:09.993 --> 01:45:15.759]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.
[01:45:15.959 --> 01:45:24.806]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely.

[01:46:07.806 --> 01:46:23.909]  UpOnPrisonPlanet.com is a very important story.
[01:46:23.929 --> 01:46:26.790]  By the way, do you guys have that video of Inhofe ready?
[01:46:27.390 --> 01:46:29.470]  Drudge Report.
[01:46:29.530 --> 01:46:33.191]  Malware accusation coincides with cyber security agenda.
[01:46:34.031 --> 01:46:38.814]  And you've got the Capitol telling the staffers, don't visit the Drudge Report, it'll put viruses on your computer.
[01:46:39.115 --> 01:46:41.236]  Total slander, total lies.
[01:46:41.737 --> 01:46:44.939]  This is something they use to demonize the internet.
[01:46:45.599 --> 01:46:58.789]  And it's similar to what's going on where they have all these databases they sell to companies and government that list thousands of websites like InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as hate sites so that they can restrict people's access to it.
[01:46:59.653 --> 01:47:03.076]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip of Inhofe, a great clip from CNS News that we linked to.
[01:47:03.096 --> 01:47:13.825]  An email was sent to several Senate offices Tuesday saying that the Sergeant at Arms is urging them not to view the website, the Drudge Report, because it is linked to viruses on Congressional computers.
[01:47:14.185 --> 01:47:23.493]  The Sergeant at Arms was not available for comment, but CNSNews.com spoke to Senator James Inhofe, who says there is no evidence of a link between the two.
[01:47:24.827 --> 01:47:38.458]  An email went out saying that the Sergeant-at-Arms is suggesting that people do not visit, people within the Capitol, do not visit the Drudge Report specifically because it's linked to viruses on Congressional computers.
[01:47:38.819 --> 01:47:40.360]  Do you have any evidence of this?
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:41.721]  Well, none whatsoever.
[01:47:41.761 --> 01:47:48.104]  It doesn't surprise me, though, because Drudge comes out with really good stuff, and we want them to access the Drudge Report.
[01:47:48.124 --> 01:47:50.125]  We're on the Drudge Report about half the time.
[01:47:50.625 --> 01:47:55.748]  Every time there's something that is really noticeable and that somebody needs to cover, Drudge is right there.
[01:47:56.208 --> 01:47:58.270]  I suspect somebody was trying to
[01:47:59.370 --> 01:48:03.691]  Make it look as if there's a virus there to discourage people from using drudge.
[01:48:04.172 --> 01:48:10.253]  Then somehow, I guess someone in the Capitol got a hold of it and said, yes, we're advising you not to use it.
[01:48:10.753 --> 01:48:12.734]  Just today, they backed down.
[01:48:13.174 --> 01:48:21.317]  So I think that maybe we were right all the time and that there's not a problem and we would encourage people to continue to use drudge.
[01:48:21.397 --> 01:48:22.357]  That's a great source.
[01:48:23.666 --> 01:48:28.449]  And why do you think initially they would pinpoint the Drudge Report in this email?
[01:48:55.387 --> 01:49:07.375]  The original email said, quote, please try to avoid DrudgeReport and WhitePages.com websites for now.
[01:49:07.795 --> 01:49:13.418]  The SAA believes these two websites are responsible for the many viruses popping up throughout the Senate.
[01:49:13.979 --> 01:49:21.864]  A follow-up email was sent out late Tuesday afternoon directly from the Sergeant at Arms, not specifically mentioning the Drudge Report, saying, quote,
[01:49:22.424 --> 01:49:34.568]  Our Information Security Operations Center has observed a significant increase in the number of Senate computers affected by fake security software that is malicious and does nothing to secure online information.
[01:49:35.348 --> 01:49:38.269]  Nicholas Ballacy, cnsnews.com, the Capitol.
[01:49:39.298 --> 01:49:44.481]  Boy, I tell you, CNS News does a great job, and I really like Inhofe, but he says it's a liberal issue.
[01:49:45.121 --> 01:49:49.583]  We've seen Republicans demonizing the internet, not Inhofe.
[01:49:50.044 --> 01:49:53.666]  We've seen calls by some of the Bush administration people in Congress.
[01:49:53.986 --> 01:49:55.787]  They had hearings about censoring the web.
[01:49:56.427 --> 01:50:00.349]  But this is a dirty trick against the Drudge Report, and again, I've been saying it for more than a year.
[01:50:00.889 --> 01:50:03.491]  Drudge Post, all the big articles about world government,
[01:50:04.071 --> 01:50:05.973]  He talks about the New World Order now.
[01:50:06.754 --> 01:50:08.615]  He talks about the naked body scanners.
[01:50:09.356 --> 01:50:13.099]  He is consistently really doing a good job.
[01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:15.702]  Just like Lou Dobbs, just like Andrew Napolitano.
[01:50:16.222 --> 01:50:20.526]  I want to praise good people that happen to be somewhat mainstream media.
[01:50:20.827 --> 01:50:22.288]  I want to praise Glenn Beck.
[01:50:23.209 --> 01:50:26.632]  I saw him do a great news report last Friday about brainwashing in schools.
[01:50:28.233 --> 01:50:29.635]  He's come out in support of Iceland.
[01:50:30.854 --> 01:50:35.040]  I just wish he didn't backstab all the time, but he's doing a little bit better of a job.
[01:50:37.464 --> 01:50:38.726]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:50:38.746 --> 01:50:41.690]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:46.846 --> 01:50:50.490]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.

[01:50:54.113 --> 01:50:58.898]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:50:58.918 --> 01:51:05.144]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:51:05.304 --> 01:51:07.547]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:51:08.047 --> 01:51:09.509]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:51:09.529 --> 01:51:10.189]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:51:10.209 --> 01:51:12.351]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:51:26.966 --> 01:51:28.806]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:51:29.086 --> 01:51:33.928]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.

[01:51:48.691 --> 01:51:50.611]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:51.071 --> 01:51:53.852]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:11.789 --> 01:52:15.276]  Well, G. Edward Griffin really needs no introduction.
[01:52:15.957 --> 01:52:18.362]  He is an icon of the liberty and freedom movement.
[01:52:19.634 --> 01:52:24.857]  A relentless fighter against collectivist, control freak, parasites everywhere.
[01:52:25.437 --> 01:52:28.539]  We're going to cover a range of issues with G. Edward Griffin today.
[01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:30.020]  And take your phone calls.
[01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:31.341]  Everybody holding 1-800-259-9231.
[01:52:31.541 --> 01:52:37.865]  We'll be interspersing calls throughout the interview, including coming up in the next segment.
[01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:41.042]  You can comment on whatever issue you bring up.
[01:52:42.102 --> 01:52:44.264]  But, gee, Edward, I wanted to ask you this.
[01:52:44.604 --> 01:52:46.785]  Why are they coming out in the open about world government?
[01:52:46.845 --> 01:52:52.909]  Why are they admitting that public schools are using laptops they give the students to watch them and their parents at home?
[01:52:54.170 --> 01:53:00.994]  Why are they... I mean, are the parasites going crazy on power trips, which we see throughout history?
[01:53:01.415 --> 01:53:07.939]  Or is there a method to their madness to try to just overwhelm us by throwing it in our face, trying to acclimate us?
[01:53:09.070 --> 01:53:10.011]  Well, it's a good question.
[01:53:10.051 --> 01:53:15.954]  I think like so many issues in that category, there probably is no one single answer that's correct.
[01:53:16.014 --> 01:53:18.555]  I think there are several that probably fit in.
[01:53:18.575 --> 01:53:36.766]  You know, these people that are pretty much pulling the big leverage aren't as smart, I don't think, as we sometimes tend to give them credit for, but I think they're very cunning and they're very agile so that they are able to take advantage of the twists and turns of the stream as they're coming down on the raft.
[01:53:37.239 --> 01:53:38.160]  They don't really plan it.
[01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:41.343]  They're going to go on the left side of the folder until they really get there, you know?
[01:53:42.644 --> 01:53:45.166]  But they're agile enough to get around it.
[01:53:45.226 --> 01:53:49.569]  So whenever issues come up, they say, OK, how are we going to make lemonade out of these lemons?
[01:53:49.629 --> 01:53:50.750]  And they do pretty good at that.
[01:53:51.791 --> 01:53:55.735]  I think, though, certain answers do become kind of obvious.
[01:53:56.335 --> 01:54:04.442]  One is that the closer they get to the goal line, the less possible it is to conceal the fact that they're heading for the goal line.
[01:54:05.314 --> 01:54:09.618]  Uh, you know, once you get right there, you can see the horses coming out of the homestretch that, oh, here they are.
[01:54:09.638 --> 01:54:10.679]  This is the end of the race.
[01:54:11.059 --> 01:54:15.604]  So they might as well come right out and be open about it, because there's no way to conceal it in the first place.
[01:54:16.284 --> 01:54:26.253]  And secondly, the thought that comes to my mind is that the conditioning of the American mind has been going on for so long, and people have become so passive.
[01:54:28.542 --> 01:54:34.965]  They're so timid about all of this that they're standing in awe and in amazement, saying, golly, look at this.
[01:54:35.326 --> 01:54:36.286]  It's happening, isn't it?
[01:54:36.906 --> 01:54:40.768]  They don't have this power of righteous indignation to really do much about it.
[01:54:40.788 --> 01:54:42.289]  They're just sort of fascinated by it.
[01:54:42.589 --> 01:54:44.130]  So you're saying deer in the headlights.
[01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:45.931]  Yeah, deer in the headlights, exactly.
[01:54:46.151 --> 01:54:48.973]  Thanks for cutting that short, because that's the perfect summary of it.
[01:54:49.373 --> 01:54:51.734]  So I think those are the two main answers to that question.
[01:54:53.973 --> 01:54:56.515]  What about the term conspiracy theorist?
[01:54:57.196 --> 01:55:08.747]  I mean, I was on a radio show and I was told I was a conspiracy theorist, that the White House and Downing Street memos that are even mainstream news admit Bush and Blair premeditatedly lied about WMDs.
[01:55:08.787 --> 01:55:09.928]  They weren't wrong about it.
[01:55:10.228 --> 01:55:11.089]  They lied about it.
[01:55:11.769 --> 01:55:14.552]  And the establishment just says, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:55:14.972 --> 01:55:16.574]  I don't see that working anymore.
[01:55:16.594 --> 01:55:18.756]  I mean, it seems to destroy their credibility.
[01:55:19.318 --> 01:55:21.100]  Well, it's working less and less, isn't it?
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:24.183]  Because more and more people have gotten used to that phrase, too.
[01:55:24.823 --> 01:55:33.171]  I kind of think of that, you know, in the American Revolution, the British called the colonists who resisted, they called them a bunch of Yankees.
[01:55:33.652 --> 01:55:34.613]  But that was an insult.
[01:55:35.354 --> 01:55:36.434]  I don't know.
[01:55:56.052 --> 01:55:56.592]  Thank you.
[01:56:17.603 --> 01:56:27.186]  Gee, Edward, maybe someday in the future, you know, when we defeat the New World Order in 50 years or 20 years, there'll be a national baseball team called the Conspiracy Theorists.
[01:56:27.326 --> 01:56:28.667]  I think that's a good idea.
[01:56:29.067 --> 01:56:36.670]  Well, you know, when I get that thrown at me, and it happens more often than not, I usually just say, well, I don't think I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[01:56:36.730 --> 01:56:39.331]  I like to think of myself as a conspiracy historian.
[01:56:40.151 --> 01:56:42.772]  And let's talk about the history instead of the theory.
[01:56:43.226 --> 01:56:47.048]  Let's talk about the history of government conspiracies that are on record.
[01:56:47.649 --> 01:56:52.952]  Then let's get into what's happening to the banking system worldwide, the economy, and phone calls.
[01:56:52.992 --> 01:56:55.354]  With G. Edward Griffin, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:56:57.489 --> 01:57:01.110]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:57:01.450 --> 01:57:09.571]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:57:10.311 --> 01:57:14.352]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:57:14.932 --> 01:57:25.754]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:57:26.374 --> 01:57:35.396]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless cloyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:57:35.896 --> 01:57:40.957]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:57:41.318 --> 01:57:48.499]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:57:48.819 --> 01:57:51.540]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:57:55.336 --> 01:57:59.559]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:57:59.879 --> 01:58:00.499]  Number one.
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:03.942]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:04.222 --> 01:58:04.782]  Number two.
[01:58:05.082 --> 01:58:09.625]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:58:09.965 --> 01:58:10.426]  It's true.
[01:58:10.706 --> 01:58:15.269]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:58:15.569 --> 01:58:16.110]  Number 3.
[01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:19.693]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:58:19.993 --> 01:58:23.716]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:58:23.896 --> 01:58:24.457]  Number 4.
[01:58:24.697 --> 01:58:27.079]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:58:27.459 --> 01:58:30.862]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:58:31.142 --> 01:58:31.343]  Number 5.
[01:58:31.923 --> 01:58:35.847]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:58:36.067 --> 01:58:40.832]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:58:41.112 --> 01:58:45.156]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:58:45.296 --> 01:58:46.858]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:59:20.458 --> 01:59:22.399]  That's buy three, get one free.
[01:59:22.619 --> 01:59:25.320]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:33.203]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[01:59:33.503 --> 01:59:36.264]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.

[01:59:47.950 --> 01:59:48.431]  Big Brother.
[02:00:02.106 --> 02:00:03.127]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:03.868 --> 02:00:04.969]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:06.450]  You want answers?
[02:00:07.211 --> 02:00:08.112]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:08.132 --> 02:00:12.415]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:12.956 --> 02:00:17.020]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.624 --> 02:00:23.527]  All right, we got 52 minutes left.
[02:00:23.567 --> 02:00:25.589]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest.
[02:00:25.629 --> 02:00:29.493]  G. Edward Griffin is a writer, a documentary film producer for 45 years.
[02:00:29.553 --> 02:00:33.698]  He's been exposing the hidden agenda now that's out in the open of the world government.
[02:00:34.744 --> 02:00:40.168]  Well-known because of his talent for researching difficult topics and presenting them in clear terms that all can understand.
[02:00:40.868 --> 02:00:51.056]  With many successful titles to his credit, he has dealt with such diverse subjects as archaeology, the Federal Reserve System, international banking, terrorism, internal subversion, U.S.
[02:00:51.076 --> 02:00:53.798]  foreign policy, the Supreme Court, and the United Nations.
[02:00:53.838 --> 02:01:03.204]  His better-known works include The Creature from Jekyll Island, Moles in High Places, The Open Gates of Troy, No Place to Hide, The Capitalist Conspiracy, More Deadly Than War.
[02:01:04.005 --> 02:01:20.470]  Perhaps we'll talk about the capitalist conspiracy today and explain why we always see big bankers and oligarchs and industrialists behind communist movements and why they're pushing for government-run health care and big government and the green tax takeover today.
[02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:22.491]  But gee, Edward, we started getting into...
[02:01:23.411 --> 02:01:24.152]  Conspiracies!
[02:01:24.192 --> 02:01:27.494]  When three guys decide to rob a bank, that's a conspiracy.
[02:01:27.514 --> 02:01:31.476]  And when somebody conspires to murder their spouse, it's a conspiracy.
[02:01:31.496 --> 02:01:39.341]  I mean, people conspire in a non-criminal way to open a sandwich shop.
[02:01:40.601 --> 02:01:49.606]  I mean, it's insane for the government and the media to say all these other countries and people are involved in conspiracies, but our government, it's never involved.
[02:01:49.667 --> 02:01:53.929]  Powerful people don't get behind closed doors to try to expand their power.
[02:01:54.991 --> 02:01:55.792]  Well, yeah.
[02:01:55.972 --> 02:02:05.786]  Anybody that scoffs at the concept of conspiracy today, I kind of feel sorry for them because I know that their brains have been captured in some way by the propaganda.
[02:02:06.086 --> 02:02:12.295]  And it also tells me that they have never read a history book because, you know, any cursory glance at history
[02:02:12.858 --> 02:02:16.761]  It produces the realization that history is driven by the action of conspiracy.
[02:02:17.141 --> 02:02:25.907]  I don't think there's a single major event in history that wasn't centered around dozens, if not hundreds, of conspiracies, large and small.
[02:02:26.387 --> 02:02:29.249]  It's the nature of man.
[02:02:29.769 --> 02:02:36.834]  It's certainly the nature of man when he's in a position to acquire great wealth or power through conspiracies.
[02:02:37.214 --> 02:02:40.236]  And of course, at the apex of that little chart of how you can
[02:02:40.988 --> 02:02:41.589]  I think so.
[02:02:58.331 --> 02:03:01.873]  Well, I've been telling you all along that there are conspiracies out there, you know.
[02:03:28.385 --> 02:03:44.206]  But it's our job to educate and to present the facts so that people can come to that conclusion themselves, not because we said so, not because we labeled it a conspiracy, but just label out the history of what happened, who did it, and document it, and then they'll say, by golly, that's a conspiracy!
[02:03:44.781 --> 02:03:50.606]  Well, G. Edward, I do a lot of interviews like you do, to magazines, newspapers.
[02:03:50.646 --> 02:03:56.630]  I was on CBC Radio yesterday, and they said, how did you come upon these views?
[02:03:56.690 --> 02:03:59.492]  How did you become a conspiracy theorist?
[02:03:59.533 --> 02:04:01.174]  And it was the same answer you just gave.
[02:04:01.994 --> 02:04:03.255]  My parents are big readers.
[02:04:04.176 --> 02:04:16.248]  My mom was a history major in college, and my dad's a physician, and I learned early on that history books were more entertaining by the time I was about 12, and my son's now the same way at 7.
[02:04:16.608 --> 02:04:21.132]  That's his favorite thing is children's, and he's now even reading adult history books.
[02:04:23.314 --> 02:04:24.675]  Well, I guess the, you know,
[02:04:53.604 --> 02:04:54.624]  Et tu, Brute?
[02:04:54.905 --> 02:04:59.527]  We all know about the Roman Conspiracy, the assassination that took place there.
[02:05:00.047 --> 02:05:04.929]  I'm just, I wasn't prepared for that question, but that would be a fun thing to assemble.
[02:05:05.509 --> 02:05:21.096]  I remember back in, I think it was the 50s or maybe the 60s, there was a lot of television coverage and news coverage to exposing the Mafia, the Mafiosa and the Costa Nostra in the United States and around the world.
[02:05:21.756 --> 02:05:22.837]  That's a conspiracy.
[02:05:22.857 --> 02:05:24.138]  Everybody acknowledges that.
[02:05:25.039 --> 02:05:26.140]  You know, it doesn't take long.
[02:05:26.180 --> 02:05:39.753]  If you really are looking for a conspiracy to study, all you have to do is go down to your local courthouse and sit there and listen to cases for a day or two and you'll find out that, I'm going to guess, probably 10-15% of them involve conspiracies.
[02:05:40.093 --> 02:05:41.594]  Conspiracies are all over the place.
[02:05:41.674 --> 02:05:42.215]  They're the norm.
[02:05:42.978 --> 02:05:43.379]  I don't
[02:06:02.739 --> 02:06:04.480]  Well, let's go back to the Mafia.
[02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:06.041]  That's the best example I've ever heard.
[02:06:06.081 --> 02:06:06.962]  I hadn't thought of that.
[02:06:07.382 --> 02:06:17.489]  Here you have J. Edgar Hoover, who was clearly being blackmailed by the Mafia, getting up in speeches and saying there's no such thing as La Cosa Nostra, and then researching those cases.
[02:06:17.509 --> 02:06:18.430]  It's so interesting.
[02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:23.614]  I probably read 15 books or more and watched a lot of television programs like most people about it.
[02:06:24.094 --> 02:06:26.596]  You had less than 30 Mafia families.
[02:06:27.216 --> 02:06:41.226]  In Italy, in Greece, in Western Europe, in Eastern Europe, and in North America, controlling the opium trade, the cocaine trade, prostitution, gambling, olive oil importation.
[02:06:41.326 --> 02:06:48.991]  I mean, these were just 30 families or less, but then government and giant private
[02:06:49.491 --> 02:06:51.572]  Corporations and U.S.
[02:06:51.612 --> 02:06:59.615]  intelligence agencies with trillions of dollars of funding since the National Security Act of 47 operating in total secret doing whatever they want.
[02:06:59.975 --> 02:07:06.017]  You mean powerful, avarice-filled people aren't going to move into those positions even if it was founded good, which it wasn't?
[02:07:06.397 --> 02:07:09.798]  You mean they're not going to move in and take power?
[02:07:09.998 --> 02:07:11.399]  You mean there's not a blue blood?
[02:07:12.259 --> 02:07:17.449]  Yale group on record that founded the CIA almost purely of skull and bones.
[02:07:17.709 --> 02:07:24.301]  That's mainline, you know, New York Times to fully take over the mafia and then knock off the Italian mob.
[02:07:25.148 --> 02:07:27.069]  Yeah, there's no question about this.
[02:07:27.109 --> 02:07:28.409]  We're talking about history now.
[02:07:28.769 --> 02:07:41.212]  This is not difficult to document that there's always been a very close working relationship between the Cosa Nostra, the Mafia, and government so-called security agencies.
[02:07:41.232 --> 02:07:43.933]  In fact, there's some people that move back and forth.
[02:07:45.133 --> 02:07:51.075]  Some of the most fascinating information that's come out, in my opinion, regarding the Kennedy assassination.
[02:07:51.627 --> 02:08:09.812]  Is that there appears to be, was a very close operational team put together, partly involving the Chicago mob, and partly involving government agencies, primarily under the direction of the CIA, but not necessarily limited to the CIA.
[02:08:10.072 --> 02:08:12.493]  So there was a merger there, and these people worked together.
[02:08:12.513 --> 02:08:19.995]  So they might, you know, compete once in a while, sometimes they work together, and then you come away from that, you put the book down, you put down the
[02:08:20.871 --> 02:08:27.496]  The magazine, the newspaper, whatever source, I just stare into space and all of a sudden you say, oh my gosh, I see now why they work together.
[02:08:28.156 --> 02:08:29.497]  They have the same mentality.
[02:08:30.518 --> 02:08:34.600]  These are the people that have created a crime syndicate inside our government.
[02:08:35.161 --> 02:08:38.363]  Our government has been taken over by a crime syndicate.
[02:08:38.423 --> 02:08:42.386]  Once that hits you, I mean, it's really a blow for a guy like me.
[02:08:42.466 --> 02:08:45.488]  I was raged, you know, a very patriotic kid.
[02:08:45.948 --> 02:08:47.209]  I thought America was, you know,
[02:08:47.668 --> 02:08:47.889]  Okay.
[02:08:54.577 --> 02:08:55.217]  Well, I have read
[02:09:23.246 --> 02:09:25.247]  No exaggeration, more than a hundred books.
[02:09:25.487 --> 02:09:27.508]  Mainline history books on World War II.
[02:09:28.308 --> 02:09:34.371]  And the declassified Nazi files of how Hitler got to power, then what he did to secure power.
[02:09:34.831 --> 02:09:40.193]  All he was doing was constantly trying to stop the Communist conspiracy in the government.
[02:09:41.154 --> 02:09:43.995]  He was constantly trying to stop the Freemason conspiracy.
[02:09:44.515 --> 02:09:49.738]  He was even suspicious of Catholic groups because he didn't think he fully controlled them, though some backed him.
[02:09:50.418 --> 02:09:52.279]  And it's all about him securing
[02:09:53.550 --> 02:09:57.771]  His power structure from the other mafias that were in the government.
[02:09:58.511 --> 02:10:00.572]  Well, yeah, gangs often have to do that.
[02:10:00.652 --> 02:10:02.552]  You know, they're always worrying about each other.
[02:10:02.572 --> 02:10:10.394]  They unite sometimes because the common enemy, in a way, is the public because they've got to police the public.
[02:10:10.414 --> 02:10:13.595]  So they'll, you know, sometimes cooperate on that.
[02:10:13.875 --> 02:10:15.436]  But people, well, they're fighting for turf.
[02:10:15.856 --> 02:10:18.896]  I don't think it's much different than street gangs in a big city.
[02:10:19.877 --> 02:10:21.297]  Yeah, they often compete with each other.
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:24.621]  Amazing, G. Edward Griffin.
[02:10:24.641 --> 02:10:28.103]  You know, I've got a lot of questions to throw out, a lot of different angles and places to go.
[02:10:28.484 --> 02:10:33.487]  I want to come back and take a few calls just to mix it up a bit because we usually wait till the end for calls.
[02:10:33.927 --> 02:10:45.075]  But then I want to talk about all the exciting things that are happening right now and the explosive growth curve of the awakening we're seeing and where you see that going.
[02:10:45.095 --> 02:10:46.596]  In fact, we've got a minute or so.
[02:10:46.656 --> 02:10:47.797]  Start getting into it now if you can.
[02:10:49.281 --> 02:10:54.585]  Well, yeah, that probably would benefit from a little thought, but what the heck, let's just jump in and swim.
[02:10:55.486 --> 02:11:11.718]  There's no doubt that there is a very rise in awakening regarding the public awakening of the fact that their own government has been taken over or heavily influenced at least by this criminal syndicate that I've been talking about.
[02:11:11.738 --> 02:11:19.104]  They're beginning to realize that the politicians and the bureaucrats at Washington that we generally refer to as our government
[02:11:19.599 --> 02:11:20.059]  I think so.
[02:11:30.333 --> 02:11:30.953]  All right, stay there.
[02:11:31.013 --> 02:11:34.595]  We're going to come back and continue to discuss this with G. Edward Griffin.
[02:11:34.615 --> 02:11:36.876]  We'll give you his websites as well and take your calls.
[02:11:56.161 --> 02:11:59.342]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:11:59.702 --> 02:12:01.543]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:12:02.003 --> 02:12:02.423]  Don't!
[02:12:02.863 --> 02:12:05.884]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:12:06.305 --> 02:12:13.427]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:12:13.407 --> 02:12:15.068]  's number one debt secret.
[02:12:15.388 --> 02:12:19.049]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.

[02:12:22.591 --> 02:12:29.616]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:12:29.977 --> 02:12:30.957]  Herb K. was right.
[02:12:31.157 --> 02:12:34.220]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:35.360]  What have you got to lose?
[02:12:35.701 --> 02:12:38.883]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[02:12:39.423 --> 02:12:40.064]  Get Herb K.'

[02:12:48.230 --> 02:12:49.131]  This is not a drill.
[02:12:49.151 --> 02:12:50.293]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:11.144]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.

[02:13:57.589 --> 02:14:01.258]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:14:01.639 --> 02:14:04.626]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:14:04.866 --> 02:14:06.289]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:14:06.986 --> 02:14:09.667]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:14:10.027 --> 02:14:15.909]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:14:16.049 --> 02:14:21.071]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:14:21.591 --> 02:14:31.234]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:14:31.354 --> 02:14:33.455]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:14:33.696 --> 02:14:35.016]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:14:35.277 --> 02:14:37.558]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:14:37.738 --> 02:14:39.600]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:14:39.860 --> 02:14:44.683]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:14:45.023 --> 02:14:49.786]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:14:58.980 --> 02:15:04.692]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[02:15:05.293 --> 02:15:07.137]  The world is changing fast.
[02:15:07.518 --> 02:15:08.961]  Are you fully prepared?
[02:15:09.742 --> 02:15:12.423]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[02:15:12.923 --> 02:15:23.226]  At PatriotFood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned meat for half price.
[02:15:23.666 --> 02:15:33.330]  And at SurvivalistSeeds.com, we now offer 50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over 10,000 heirloom seeds.
[02:15:34.986 --> 02:15:39.269]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[02:15:39.849 --> 02:15:44.151]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[02:15:44.472 --> 02:15:46.833]  Food insurance, just in case.
[02:15:47.413 --> 02:15:52.036]  Owned by me, Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[02:16:00.729 --> 02:16:03.871]  Okay, Gilbert Griffin, you were talking about what are we going to do about it.
[02:16:04.191 --> 02:16:05.172]  Well, look at Iceland.
[02:16:05.552 --> 02:16:14.098]  They identified the banks as the enemy, trying to make the public pay for debts that they didn't even owe, that the banks had engineered in a Ponzi scheme.
[02:16:14.679 --> 02:16:18.561]  I mean, I think that's another prototype of what the rest of the world should do.
[02:16:19.702 --> 02:16:22.884]  Well, yeah, that's one of the earmarks of the conspiracy.
[02:16:22.904 --> 02:16:23.744]  We're back to that word again.
[02:16:23.764 --> 02:16:27.926]  I don't think that these guys that created the Federal Reserve thought of themselves as conspirators.
[02:16:28.146 --> 02:16:29.547]  They thought of themselves as being
[02:16:50.066 --> 02:16:54.976]  Uh, shrewd businessmen and in a sort of weird way being high-minded citizens.
[02:16:55.717 --> 02:16:58.583]  You know, they really thought they were putting together a system.
[02:17:00.985 --> 02:17:13.032]  No, but that's what David Rockefeller says in a lot of internal minutes that have come out there.
[02:17:13.373 --> 02:17:14.873]  We bankers know best.
[02:17:14.954 --> 02:17:17.755]  We need eugenics is good.
[02:17:17.815 --> 02:17:19.636]  We're going to take over for you.
[02:17:19.656 --> 02:17:21.457]  You don't know what's best for you.
[02:17:21.638 --> 02:17:22.458]  That's it exactly.
[02:17:22.498 --> 02:17:23.759]  That's the collectivist mind.
[02:17:24.299 --> 02:17:31.584]  And so they really believe that stuff, and it's clear when you read their letters and their internal memos that they're convinced of that.
[02:17:31.624 --> 02:17:43.952]  So, anyway, they didn't think they were conspirators because they didn't think they were doing anything wrong, and they certainly weren't doing anything illegal because they were drafting the law that would make their plan quite legal.
[02:17:44.632 --> 02:17:48.474]  They were doing perhaps what we should be doing, is meeting and saying, okay, let's
[02:17:50.081 --> 02:17:53.524]  A piece of legislation that's going to unravel some of the old legislation.
[02:17:53.644 --> 02:17:56.506]  You mean commoners writing legislation?
[02:17:58.027 --> 02:17:59.608]  Well, maybe not commoners.
[02:17:59.909 --> 02:18:02.290]  Maybe we're common, but I don't think we're too common.
[02:18:02.350 --> 02:18:05.453]  I wish there were more of us, and then I'd say, yes, commoners.
[02:18:06.273 --> 02:18:13.799]  But no, I think that brings up a really good point because there's a sort of an implied expectation among a lot of
[02:18:14.299 --> 02:18:22.207]  Newly awakening people that, well, we've got to get 51% of the population on board before anything can happen because this is a democracy, isn't it?
[02:18:22.547 --> 02:18:24.509]  And the majority must rule and all of that.
[02:18:25.169 --> 02:18:32.957]  But the reality is that always throughout history, and certainly throughout American history, the country has been led by a very small group of people.
[02:18:33.057 --> 02:18:36.040]  Percentage-wise, way less than 3% of the population.
[02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:39.882]  And that's true of every country in the world.
[02:18:40.542 --> 02:18:42.483]  The others will just go along with whatever.
[02:18:42.503 --> 02:18:56.091]  And that's why the conspirators are so scared of us, because I'd say we conservatively have 15% that are now really hardcore awake, and all the polls show that, and 60-70% that are really upset and ready to be awakened.
[02:18:56.451 --> 02:18:59.774]  Well, that's true, but the rest of that formula is the catch.
[02:19:00.494 --> 02:19:01.675]  It's not just the numbers.
[02:19:02.236 --> 02:19:08.240]  Yes, well, I would say we have 15% or maybe more, but the other part of the equation is where are these people?
[02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:08.841]  Who are they?
[02:19:08.921 --> 02:19:10.122]  What power do they have?
[02:19:10.582 --> 02:19:14.625]  Well, our 15% doesn't hold enough power to match their 1%.
[02:19:15.586 --> 02:19:28.633]  Because the collectivists have burrowed into all the honeypots, like parasites, and they're up there greedily running everything, and they see us waking up, so they go, hire SWAT teams, build armored fortresses, scan them, control them!
[02:19:28.813 --> 02:19:31.335]  They're waking up that we're sucking off of them!
[02:19:31.695 --> 02:19:32.915]  No!
[02:19:33.176 --> 02:19:36.497]  We're collectivists, we're saving you from global warming!
[02:19:37.158 --> 02:19:38.078]  Ah!
[02:19:38.218 --> 02:19:38.959]  I love that, Alex.
[02:19:39.359 --> 02:19:40.940]  You ever think of going into show business?
[02:19:43.621 --> 02:19:45.123]  I'm sorry, I was having some fun.
[02:19:45.803 --> 02:19:48.746]  Yeah, it is fun, but it's pretty accurate too, amazingly so.
[02:19:49.707 --> 02:19:54.813]  They probably don't sound hysterical, but possibly inside their head they're thinking that way.
[02:19:55.273 --> 02:19:57.436]  But that is it, exactly.
[02:19:58.016 --> 02:20:00.439]  Our 15 or 20 percent, and it's growing.
[02:20:00.959 --> 02:20:01.600]  We're good to go.
[02:20:17.788 --> 02:20:18.208]  We're good
[02:20:37.721 --> 02:21:04.769]  Well, gee, Edward, do you think there, and we'll talk more about solutions when we come back and go to calls, but clearly, and they even say this in some of their white papers, Cass Sunstein at the White House, that because we're waking up, because we're trying to take over the states peacefully, because we are going with the long view of history that you and others have rightfully called for as historians, they are now racing to the finish line and trying to put their control grid in to try to checkmate us before we build up enough of our initiative to defeat them.
[02:21:05.455 --> 02:21:06.355]  That's it exactly.
[02:21:06.916 --> 02:21:12.318]  And there's some debate as to whether or not they've already reached that point.
[02:21:12.898 --> 02:21:15.999]  I don't think they have, but I think they're very close to it.
[02:21:16.519 --> 02:21:23.062]  I mean, the two pillars of sovereignty are monetary sovereignty and military sovereignty.
[02:21:23.122 --> 02:21:27.963]  Well, they're racing right now to get rid of American monetary sovereignty.
[02:21:28.444 --> 02:21:33.245]  And of course, whether the military is really sovereign or not is up for debate, too.
[02:21:33.265 --> 02:21:34.746]  But it's certainly no debate.
[02:21:35.166 --> 02:21:36.747]  Stay there, let's come back and talk about it.
[02:21:37.847 --> 02:21:41.469]  And to transfer all our laws over to the UN and regional governorships.
[02:21:41.849 --> 02:21:45.171]  G. Edward Griffin, one of those evil people straight ahead.
[02:21:45.951 --> 02:21:48.933]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:21:49.873 --> 02:21:52.555]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:55.472 --> 02:21:58.194]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[02:21:58.514 --> 02:22:04.257]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from efoodsdirect.com.
[02:22:04.517 --> 02:22:12.362]  Anyone placing food orders on the large volume production run scheduled for the week of March 22nd can get a lot of food for very little cost.
[02:22:12.782 --> 02:22:18.908]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[02:22:19.148 --> 02:22:21.109]  That's buy three, get one free.
[02:22:21.310 --> 02:22:24.032]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[02:22:24.232 --> 02:22:31.779]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[02:22:32.199 --> 02:22:35.082]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[02:22:35.462 --> 02:22:36.303]  Another example?
[02:22:36.523 --> 02:22:39.566]  Buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[02:22:39.706 --> 02:22:44.851]  You've got to go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.

[02:22:45.672 --> 02:22:46.733]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[02:22:57.305 --> 02:23:00.950]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:23:01.311 --> 02:23:04.334]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:23:04.575 --> 02:23:05.977]  Is it finishing off this agenda?
[02:23:06.878 --> 02:23:09.339]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:23:09.359 --> 02:23:15.562]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:23:15.763 --> 02:23:20.785]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:23:20.925 --> 02:23:30.910]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:23:31.050 --> 02:23:33.150]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:23:33.391 --> 02:23:34.711]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:23:34.971 --> 02:23:37.271]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:23:37.431 --> 02:23:39.292]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:23:39.552 --> 02:23:44.293]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:23:44.633 --> 02:23:49.434]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:23:56.673 --> 02:24:02.954]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[02:24:03.354 --> 02:24:09.476]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:24:09.756 --> 02:24:15.737]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[02:24:16.077 --> 02:24:20.978]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[02:24:21.458 --> 02:24:29.303]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:24:29.643 --> 02:24:33.786]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[02:24:34.246 --> 02:24:37.908]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.

[02:25:04.090 --> 02:25:07.135]  We're going back to G. Edward Griffin here in just a moment.
[02:25:07.575 --> 02:25:09.098]  And then straight to your phone calls.
[02:25:09.278 --> 02:25:10.920]  Always great to have him spending time with us.
[02:25:10.941 --> 02:25:13.364]  We're going to give you some of his websites as well.
[02:25:14.793 --> 02:25:23.477]  Full of solutions, free videos, articles, you name it, and an organization, Freedom Force International, trying to organize for the long view, the long haul.
[02:25:23.957 --> 02:25:29.140]  Because as Ron Paul and others have said, as the oppression intensifies, more people are going to be looking for solutions.
[02:25:29.660 --> 02:25:35.363]  And the establishment puts out counterfeit solutions, they even have written books about this, to try to control opposition.
[02:25:35.403 --> 02:25:37.424]  William F. Buckley taking over the conservative movement.
[02:25:38.304 --> 02:25:44.468]  We see the Republicans taking over the Tea Party, Obama creating a fake coffee party, stealing our idea of two months ago.
[02:25:44.808 --> 02:25:48.050]  But ours was to truly, you know, take back the Tea Parties.
[02:25:48.090 --> 02:25:51.092]  This is Obama creating really an illegal alien party.
[02:25:51.132 --> 02:25:51.873]  We've analyzed it.
[02:25:51.893 --> 02:25:52.873]  It's mainly illegal aliens.
[02:25:53.794 --> 02:25:55.055]  But now they call it the Coffee Party.
[02:25:55.115 --> 02:25:56.135]  Oh, we're the true Americans!
[02:25:56.515 --> 02:25:59.377]  We're 10,000 illegal aliens out here with an Obama operative.
[02:25:59.697 --> 02:26:01.539]  And the media's like, it's so grassroots!
[02:26:02.319 --> 02:26:03.040]  Lying to everyone.
[02:26:03.060 --> 02:26:04.921]  We're going back to G. Edward Griffin here in just a moment.
[02:26:05.737 --> 02:26:11.781]  But I want to tell you about one of the sponsors that's made today's radio show possible, Front Sight Firearms Training.
[02:26:12.682 --> 02:26:15.384]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza?
[02:26:16.468 --> 02:26:21.651]  Is offering a five days of firearms training at their Pahrump, Nevada facility.
[02:26:21.852 --> 02:26:24.433]  The No Drill Instructor Tough Guy Attitude Place.
[02:26:24.694 --> 02:26:25.034]  Awesome.
[02:26:25.354 --> 02:26:26.335]  It's a family event.
[02:26:26.395 --> 02:26:27.896]  Two day, five day, four day events.
[02:26:28.176 --> 02:26:36.521]  But if you do the five days of world class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar, it's very inexpensive, great value.
[02:26:36.922 --> 02:26:42.005]  If you act fast, he will give you a Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:26:42.545 --> 02:26:44.407]  It is not enough to just own firearms.
[02:26:44.807 --> 02:26:46.248]  You need to know how to use them.
[02:26:46.788 --> 02:26:51.790]  Also, a lot of great free stuff on the Front Sight website, FrontSight.com, and a newsletter.
[02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.790]  Check it out today.
[02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:56.511]  FrontSight.com, at the front of your firearm, the Front Sight.
[02:26:56.771 --> 02:26:58.632]  FrontSight.com.
[02:26:58.932 --> 02:27:00.652]  Check them out today.
[02:27:01.273 --> 02:27:01.593]  Okay.
[02:27:01.693 --> 02:27:03.813]  Oh, by the way, we are being hacked again.
[02:27:04.674 --> 02:27:07.855]  We were hit with a distributed denial-of-service attack.
[02:27:08.775 --> 02:27:22.960]  Last year, on InfoWars and Prison Planet, when we were exposing the swine flu at the height of the government hysteria, now proven to be a hoax, and we were hit yesterday, and it took down PrisonPlanet.tv for about three hours.
[02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:24.881]  There was some other stuff going on with the other sides.
[02:27:24.901 --> 02:27:25.681]  We beefed those up.
[02:27:25.701 --> 02:27:26.621]  It wasn't too bad of a problem.
[02:27:26.901 --> 02:27:31.343]  They're now hitting us again since about one o'clock today, about an hour and a half ago.
[02:27:31.903 --> 02:27:33.205]  But we've beefed it up.
[02:27:33.305 --> 02:27:36.328]  People can still get on, watch the films, watch the live show right now.
[02:27:36.749 --> 02:27:39.051]  Simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv and Living Color.
[02:27:39.792 --> 02:27:42.155]  And read my book, Paul Watson's book.
[02:27:42.475 --> 02:27:43.457]  All the access is there.
[02:27:43.537 --> 02:27:48.522]  So counter this attempted censorship by getting a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[02:27:48.623 --> 02:27:50.284]  Six years up and running in
[02:27:51.025 --> 02:27:51.846]  April coming up.
[02:27:51.886 --> 02:27:53.206]  Okay, going back to G. Edward Griffin.
[02:27:53.587 --> 02:27:56.388]  G. Edward, when I was doing my David Rockefeller imitations, I was interrupting you.
[02:27:56.408 --> 02:28:00.531]  So you were talking about solutions to kick out the parasites.
[02:28:00.571 --> 02:28:04.353]  I think, number one, my job is to expose them for the criminal parasites they are.
[02:28:04.833 --> 02:28:06.854]  The citizens need to do that to awaken more.
[02:28:07.194 --> 02:28:17.701]  But with the awakened mass we have, we have to start moving in to the power centers to re-infuse the Bill of Rights, Constitution, and rugged individualism.
[02:28:17.741 --> 02:28:18.341]  Please continue.
[02:28:18.908 --> 02:28:20.109]  Well, that pretty well sums it.
[02:28:20.169 --> 02:28:22.171]  All I can do is cover the same ground, Alex.
[02:28:23.272 --> 02:28:31.361]  The fact of the matter is that humans have this instinct to follow and to cluster into groups and follow leaders.
[02:28:32.081 --> 02:28:33.543]  And we have this herd instinct.
[02:28:33.563 --> 02:28:34.464]  There's no denying it.
[02:28:35.146 --> 02:28:42.870]  And so we tend to follow the opinion leaders of our country, the political leaders of our country.
[02:28:44.391 --> 02:28:48.494]  Before we make up our minds, we say, well, what did they say about this on the news?
[02:28:48.534 --> 02:28:49.774]  You know, that sort of thing.
[02:28:50.114 --> 02:28:52.216]  It's silly, but everybody has that instinct.
[02:28:52.696 --> 02:28:55.377]  And so our opponents have figured that out long ago.
[02:28:55.497 --> 02:28:59.920]  They decided, OK, we'll just be the leadership of all of these power centers of opinion.
[02:29:00.532 --> 02:29:00.872]  I think so.
[02:29:23.638 --> 02:29:24.199]  We're good to go.
[02:29:36.977 --> 02:29:42.639]  One man, like a Ron Paul or somebody else, if they put him in the White House, that'll take care of everything.
[02:29:42.659 --> 02:29:43.859]  Well, that's nonsense.
[02:29:44.019 --> 02:29:54.962]  One man, first of all, is not going to get elected if you've got all the media against him and the educational system against him and all the unions against him, you know, and everybody's against him.
[02:29:55.322 --> 02:30:02.644]  These organizations, I should say, maybe the people would be for him, but the people would be convinced that he doesn't stand a chance because of what the media says.
[02:30:02.964 --> 02:30:03.344]  I think so.
[02:30:15.107 --> 02:30:15.767]  I don't think so.
[02:30:40.359 --> 02:30:46.567]  You know, even if he were not blocked, and he could do great and wonderful things, he wouldn't.
[02:30:47.207 --> 02:30:56.139]  Because the kind of guy we're talking about would want to follow the Constitution, and the Constitution says that the President doesn't do anything except follow the orders of Congress.
[02:30:56.943 --> 02:30:58.044]  And that's what he has said.
[02:30:59.004 --> 02:30:59.725]  That's the problem.
[02:30:59.885 --> 02:31:01.045]  That's exactly the problem.
[02:31:01.085 --> 02:31:07.069]  And so we say, well, let's put a man on a white horse in charge and just let him be a dictator for us.
[02:31:07.469 --> 02:31:08.569]  No, no, no, no.
[02:31:08.830 --> 02:31:11.191]  It doesn't work that way or we don't want it to work that way.
[02:31:11.798 --> 02:31:28.975]  So, we're back to the drawing boards, which is the only way to solve this problem, in my view, is to ride the wave of this mass educational awareness that you and I and others are trying to create, and then out of the mass numbers that
[02:31:29.315 --> 02:31:29.695]  Continue.
[02:31:57.574 --> 02:31:59.336]  Well, how do I think it's going to work?
[02:31:59.376 --> 02:32:00.398]  I see it already happening.
[02:32:01.419 --> 02:32:07.527]  We get letters all the time, emails, phone calls from people saying, you know, we've decided to follow your advice.
[02:32:08.308 --> 02:32:12.314]  We ran for city council six months ago and
[02:32:13.214 --> 02:32:14.855]  Lo and behold, we won!
[02:32:16.016 --> 02:32:22.441]  And somebody will say, well, I've decided this year I'm going to declare my candidacy in the congressional seat in my district.
[02:32:22.521 --> 02:32:30.227]  Yes, it's held right now by a very staunch, well-known political figure, but nobody really likes him.
[02:32:30.267 --> 02:32:31.608]  It's just that nobody has a choice.
[02:32:32.369 --> 02:32:34.110]  So we're going to offer a choice.
[02:32:34.391 --> 02:32:36.832]  Well, this is just the beginning of that kind of a thing.
[02:32:37.513 --> 02:32:42.277]  Once every year we have thousands of people making that kind of a decision.
[02:32:42.817 --> 02:33:03.390]  And if they have the smarts of being able to organize a well-run, well-thought-out, and well-funded political campaign, once that starts to happen, and it is starting to happen now, but once this wave becomes large enough, I think that's the point, the tipping point, where we can restore the republic that's been lost.
[02:33:03.410 --> 02:33:04.751]  And let's be clear about this.
[02:33:06.212 --> 02:33:09.454]  We lost 9 out of 10 conservatively.
[02:33:10.686 --> 02:33:10.906]  of course.
[02:33:32.745 --> 02:33:35.748]  Masses of other people to start running in their state.
[02:33:35.808 --> 02:33:39.212]  So we may not win every time, but we're out there getting the message out.
[02:33:39.252 --> 02:33:50.463]  Just like Ron Paul didn't win in 2008, but it got the real issues out there about the inflation tax, the wars, that conservatives don't have to be warmongers.
[02:33:50.723 --> 02:33:52.985]  He won the CPAC straw poll.
[02:33:53.826 --> 02:34:00.370]  But the bigger issue is, once we support Patriot candidates and if they start flip-flopping, you've got to drop them immediately.
[02:34:00.730 --> 02:34:06.274]  There has to be a code that we don't just run and then start getting some power and flip-flop.
[02:34:06.834 --> 02:34:08.435]  If that happens, you've got to drop somebody.
[02:34:08.455 --> 02:34:12.378]  You've got to go with people that are steadfast and have proven that they won't waffle.
[02:34:13.098 --> 02:34:14.119]  That they won't give in.
[02:34:14.499 --> 02:34:16.341]  But take the global warming hoax.
[02:34:16.461 --> 02:34:17.882]  It's completely collapsing.
[02:34:19.143 --> 02:34:20.584]  The masses are waking up to it.
[02:34:20.604 --> 02:34:21.765]  The establishment doesn't care, though.
[02:34:21.785 --> 02:34:22.846]  They say they're going ahead with it.
[02:34:23.166 --> 02:34:24.507]  But so that fight will continue.
[02:34:24.548 --> 02:34:27.410]  But we're seeing that we're gaining momentum.
[02:34:28.130 --> 02:34:29.031]  We're getting purchased.
[02:34:29.051 --> 02:34:30.052]  We're getting a toehold.
[02:34:30.512 --> 02:34:31.713]  We're having successes.
[02:34:31.753 --> 02:34:33.315]  The flu was exposed as a fraud.
[02:34:33.755 --> 02:34:36.137]  Record numbers of people said no.
[02:34:36.177 --> 02:34:41.662]  The Wall Street Journal reported the lowest level ever for both seasonal and the swine flu.
[02:34:42.342 --> 02:34:42.883]  Uh, shot.
[02:34:42.983 --> 02:34:44.364]  And lo and behold, less flu.
[02:34:44.404 --> 02:34:46.225]  Because we know the flu shot's giving people the flu.
[02:34:46.665 --> 02:34:47.526]  Many studies show.
[02:34:48.046 --> 02:34:50.808]  Uh, we're seeing victories against, so far, the healthcare bill.
[02:34:51.168 --> 02:34:52.409]  It's completely unpopular.
[02:34:52.449 --> 02:34:54.631]  The Democrats are destroying themselves if they pass it.
[02:34:54.891 --> 02:34:57.533]  But the point is, we do see the momentum really shifting.
[02:34:59.073 --> 02:35:21.063]  Well, yes, I'm glad you brought that up, because although I think we all can take great encouragement from that, there's an area involved in that issue that is generally being ignored, and it scares the heck out of me, which is that under these conditions, it is extremely easy for someone from the other side to provide false leadership.
[02:35:22.200 --> 02:35:25.603]  I can tell you that, well, what's an example?
[02:35:25.663 --> 02:35:32.888]  The Federal Reserve System, by which I know a little, was actually sold to the American people.
[02:35:34.809 --> 02:35:43.695]  Not entirely, but partially, because the very people who drafted the Federal Reserve pretended that they were opposed to it.
[02:35:44.415 --> 02:35:49.059]  In other words, they led their own opposition to make sure that the opposition would fail.
[02:35:50.247 --> 02:35:51.328]  And who is that today?
[02:35:51.648 --> 02:35:53.189]  It's Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin.
[02:35:53.769 --> 02:35:55.770]  I mean, clearly they're the Judas Iscariots.
[02:35:56.130 --> 02:35:56.571]  Exactly.
[02:35:56.651 --> 02:35:58.872]  I would certainly say that's an easy choice.
[02:35:59.172 --> 02:35:59.912]  But they're out there.
[02:36:00.333 --> 02:36:15.821]  And some of them, I'm sure that there are some of them that could come on your radio show and agree with everything you say, and agree with everything I say, and say a few other good things, and yet they could be just planning to get elected so that people would say, ah, we got a good man elected.
[02:36:16.241 --> 02:36:17.822]  And yet they won't do anything.
[02:36:18.202 --> 02:36:19.282]  They'll buckle, I should say.
[02:36:19.582 --> 02:36:28.626]  And that points to the fact that when we say that they're going to buckle or they're going to switch, it's because we've never asked these candidates what they really believe.
[02:36:28.726 --> 02:36:30.387]  We've seen what they said.
[02:36:31.207 --> 02:36:32.207]  We've heard what they said.
[02:36:32.607 --> 02:36:36.729]  We said, well, they're against the swine flu charade.
[02:36:36.909 --> 02:36:39.650]  They want to get us out of the war in the Middle East and so forth.
[02:36:40.190 --> 02:36:41.671]  Well, heck, Obama said that.
[02:36:43.075 --> 02:36:45.996]  But, you know, what they say is not important.
[02:36:46.036 --> 02:36:46.696]  It's what they do.
[02:36:46.777 --> 02:36:49.718]  And nobody's asking these candidates, what do they believe?
[02:36:49.918 --> 02:36:50.998]  What are their principles?
[02:36:51.398 --> 02:36:52.659]  What's their ideology?
[02:36:53.059 --> 02:36:58.461]  And that's where I come into the fore, because, as you know, with Freedom Force, we're totally focused on ideology.
[02:36:58.821 --> 02:37:04.683]  We have a creed of freedom, and we want our candidates who are going into office to say, yes, this is my creed.
[02:37:04.984 --> 02:37:06.164]  I believe this.
[02:37:06.404 --> 02:37:07.224]  These are not issues.
[02:37:07.264 --> 02:37:08.545]  These are principles, you know?
[02:37:09.145 --> 02:37:13.467]  I believe, you know, that the individual is more important than the group.
[02:37:13.927 --> 02:37:18.949]  And that the group must not, that the individual must not be sacrificed in the name of the group.
[02:37:19.009 --> 02:37:20.490]  That's a firm principle, you know?
[02:37:20.990 --> 02:37:25.572]  And we believe that all laws should apply to all groups of people equally.
[02:37:25.993 --> 02:37:27.393]  Not any exceptions.
[02:37:27.773 --> 02:37:28.013]  None.
[02:37:28.634 --> 02:37:29.094]  Zilch.
[02:37:29.534 --> 02:37:29.834]  Zilch.
[02:37:30.134 --> 02:37:30.414]  Nunca.
[02:37:30.534 --> 02:37:30.935]  Nunca.
[02:37:31.395 --> 02:37:32.735]  You know, this is a principle.
[02:37:33.096 --> 02:37:35.897]  Well, anybody that says, yes, I believe that, would have to
[02:37:36.417 --> 02:37:36.938]  I think so.
[02:37:50.922 --> 02:37:55.985]  And those who have got certain political connections can get exemptions that other people cannot.
[02:37:56.305 --> 02:37:59.567]  If you're married and you've got 25 kids, you don't have to pay any tax.
[02:37:59.827 --> 02:38:03.529]  Whereas if you're not married and you have 25 kids, you do pay tax.
[02:38:03.590 --> 02:38:06.311]  And so this doesn't treat everybody the same.
[02:38:06.871 --> 02:38:12.775]  So anyway, my point is that now is the time for a lot of candidates to come forth and they'll speak
[02:38:13.255 --> 02:38:16.358]  Very brilliantly against all of the bad things that are going on.
[02:38:16.738 --> 02:38:20.321]  It's time to ask them, oh wait, okay, now we know what you're against.
[02:38:20.661 --> 02:38:21.882]  Now what do you believe?
[02:38:22.223 --> 02:38:23.223]  What are you for?
[02:38:23.564 --> 02:38:24.865]  What are your principles?
[02:38:25.105 --> 02:38:27.367]  What kind of a new system are you going to create?
[02:38:27.767 --> 02:38:29.268]  And then just sit back and see what they say.
[02:38:30.369 --> 02:38:33.172]  All right, G. Ebert Griffin, always amazing having you on.
[02:38:33.192 --> 02:38:38.156]  I want to take some calls here in the last 14 minutes we have, but fire out the websites for new listeners.
[02:38:38.854 --> 02:38:47.437]  Well, the commercial website where we sell books and videos and recordings is called Reality Zone, realityzone.com.
[02:38:47.937 --> 02:38:49.518]  You'll find about a hundred different items there.
[02:38:50.158 --> 02:38:57.981]  But our think tank site where we talk about issues like we're discussing today, that's our organizational site for Freedom Force International.
[02:38:58.701 --> 02:39:03.303]  And the URL for that is freedomforceinternational.org.
[02:39:04.770 --> 02:39:09.955]  So that's the place I hope people will go and spend some time reading about these ideological issues.
[02:39:10.856 --> 02:39:11.496]  Absolutely.
[02:39:11.556 --> 02:39:13.478]  Let's go to Brian in Texas.
[02:39:13.498 --> 02:39:14.799]  You're on the air with G. Edward Griffin.
[02:39:14.819 --> 02:39:15.240]  Go ahead.
[02:39:16.601 --> 02:39:17.242]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:39:17.682 --> 02:39:17.922]  Good.
[02:39:17.962 --> 02:39:18.343]  Go ahead.
[02:39:19.303 --> 02:39:26.390]  Actually, one thing I wanted to mention, I think one thing you guys are, what we need to do is really take the wind out of the sails of these guys.
[02:39:26.986 --> 02:39:27.487]  The Parasite Criminals!
[02:39:27.507 --> 02:39:28.128]  The Ruling Criminals!
[02:39:37.878 --> 02:39:41.982]  Well, no, I just mean as far as correcting other individuals when we hear them saying it in the common day.
[02:39:42.422 --> 02:39:48.828]  Even as far as, like, Obama's... Yeah, well, they call public servants authorities, officials, and I always point that out.
[02:39:49.188 --> 02:39:50.409]  Jim, do you have a comment on that?
[02:39:51.070 --> 02:39:51.770]  Uh, amen.
[02:39:51.830 --> 02:39:52.571]  That's about it.
[02:39:53.091 --> 02:39:55.393]  How about the king of parasites?
[02:39:56.014 --> 02:39:57.475]  And I think your caller's right.
[02:39:57.495 --> 02:39:58.036]  Brian is right.
[02:39:59.448 --> 02:40:00.769]  Well, what's a good term for them then?
[02:40:00.969 --> 02:40:02.010]  King parasites?
[02:40:03.251 --> 02:40:04.312]  Mafia rulers?
[02:40:05.733 --> 02:40:06.873]  Illegitimate scum?
[02:40:06.933 --> 02:40:08.475]  I mean, what do you call them?
[02:40:09.535 --> 02:40:11.137]  I guess it depends on the occasion.
[02:40:11.177 --> 02:40:12.838]  You don't want to offend people.
[02:40:12.878 --> 02:40:16.861]  The object is not just to spit out... But what do we call the ruling class?
[02:40:16.941 --> 02:40:17.882]  The ruling criminals?
[02:40:18.282 --> 02:40:19.583]  What's wrong with the ruling class?
[02:40:22.245 --> 02:40:25.827]  Then let people decide for themselves whether they're criminals, you know?
[02:40:27.008 --> 02:40:30.890]  I think sometimes we tend to force our editorial conclusions on people.
[02:40:31.750 --> 02:40:39.174]  I think we probably would be better off if we just stuck more with the historical fact and let people put the twist to it that they want.
[02:40:39.494 --> 02:40:40.235]  Okay, good point.
[02:40:40.295 --> 02:40:40.995]  Anything else, Brian?
[02:40:41.735 --> 02:40:45.017]  Yeah, I actually had one other point I wanted to ask G. Edward directly.
[02:40:45.918 --> 02:40:50.420]  The release of this, and Alex, you touched on it earlier in the week, Adam Gadon issue of they found him, they didn't find him.
[02:40:51.604 --> 02:41:02.072]  You know, do you think that's a pretext of them trying to gain sympathy for Homeland Security to come in and start going after, you know, Tea Party goers, conspiracy theorists, things like that?
[02:41:02.412 --> 02:41:02.893]  I think so.
[02:41:03.013 --> 02:41:03.713]  Go ahead, Alex.
[02:41:03.913 --> 02:41:04.754]  No, no, go ahead.
[02:41:05.054 --> 02:41:05.935]  Well, I think so, yeah.
[02:41:05.955 --> 02:41:10.838]  They want to keep that mentality of fear always present.
[02:41:11.259 --> 02:41:16.342]  And so they've got to talk about terrorism and threats and red alerts and yellow alerts and so forth.
[02:41:16.362 --> 02:41:17.303]  That's constantly there.
[02:41:17.543 --> 02:41:20.605]  Well, Governor Ridge admitted in his book last year they issued fake alerts.
[02:41:20.645 --> 02:41:22.047]  Thank you, Brian.
[02:41:22.087 --> 02:41:26.430]  And by the way, that's a violation of the Patriot Act to issue a fake terror threat.
[02:41:26.950 --> 02:41:28.892]  Let's talk to Doug in Tennessee.
[02:41:28.912 --> 02:41:29.913]  You're on the air, Doug.
[02:41:30.853 --> 02:41:33.836]  Hey, Alex, I want to ditto what Brian said.
[02:41:33.896 --> 02:41:39.160]  We need to stop calling them authorities and stop telling them that they have authorities.
[02:41:39.580 --> 02:41:40.581]  They're beyond their authority.
[02:41:40.621 --> 02:41:42.382]  They have power, but they don't have authorities.
[02:41:43.163 --> 02:41:47.226]  But I watched a video the other day that really inspired me.
[02:41:47.961 --> 02:41:49.062]  It's called The Solution.
[02:41:49.522 --> 02:41:52.025]  It's on YouTube, The Solution by Schaefer Cox.
[02:41:53.025 --> 02:41:57.790]  And you can find it also on LincolnCountyWatch.org.
[02:41:59.151 --> 02:42:00.672]  Do you have a question for Jammer Griffin?
[02:42:01.713 --> 02:42:03.835]  Well, this is The Solution he was talking about.
[02:42:03.855 --> 02:42:04.936]  You know, what do we do?
[02:42:05.817 --> 02:42:15.045]  And what they're doing up there in Fairbanks, Alaska is setting up their own court and having a common law court
[02:42:16.267 --> 02:42:28.580]  And they also have a militia for enforcement and they have a call-in line where people can call like a 911 type situation when their rights are being violated by
[02:42:29.531 --> 02:42:30.471]  Yeah, even police officers.
[02:42:30.491 --> 02:42:34.332]  Well, I don't want to pass judgment on this, but I've seen this a hundred times, a hundred.
[02:42:34.632 --> 02:42:36.833]  This is very dangerous, what you're talking about.
[02:42:37.653 --> 02:42:38.773]  There is a common law.
[02:42:38.953 --> 02:42:44.554]  Our courts, set up through the state constitutions, are supposedly carrying it out, but they're not.
[02:42:45.235 --> 02:42:50.536]  But we'll talk, we'll get G. Edwards Griffin's take on what you just talked about on the other side, Doug.
[02:42:50.556 --> 02:42:51.156]  We'll be right back.
[02:43:00.658 --> 02:43:01.699]  Afraid to answer it?
[02:43:02.639 --> 02:43:04.080]  Afraid to answer your door?
[02:43:04.520 --> 02:43:11.523]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about 10 times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[02:43:11.803 --> 02:43:13.864]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[02:43:14.024 --> 02:43:15.805]  They are expensive payment plans.
[02:43:16.045 --> 02:43:18.026]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense?
[02:43:20.913 --> 02:43:24.154]  Zero debt in 90 days gets you out of debt in 90 days.
[02:43:24.394 --> 02:43:25.014]  Guaranteed.
[02:43:25.254 --> 02:43:27.715]  And that's the website you need to visit right now.

[02:43:57.285 --> 02:44:00.951]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:44:01.312 --> 02:44:04.317]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:44:04.557 --> 02:44:05.980]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:44:06.681 --> 02:44:09.343]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:44:09.363 --> 02:44:15.588]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:44:15.749 --> 02:44:20.773]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:44:20.933 --> 02:44:24.095]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:44:24.215 --> 02:44:30.921]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:44:31.041 --> 02:44:33.142]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:44:33.383 --> 02:44:34.723]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:44:34.964 --> 02:44:37.245]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:44:37.425 --> 02:44:39.287]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:44:39.547 --> 02:44:44.390]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:49.493]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:45:53.450 --> 02:46:07.361]  I was up at Infowars.com reading the article about the pervert behavior of government.
[02:46:07.401 --> 02:46:10.903]  Naked bodies scanning us, cameras in school bathrooms, the girls showers.
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:20.025]  And people are posting links to articles where they check girls' panties in school, making sure they're the right color and everyone's agreeing, yeah, yeah, that happens at my school.
[02:46:20.866 --> 02:46:22.967]  And it's just, there's a method to the madness.
[02:46:23.007 --> 02:46:27.370]  It's about training you that you have absolutely no rights and you're like a slave.
[02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:31.193]  It's like, we're going to strip you down and make you naked before we herd you into the showers.
[02:46:32.214 --> 02:46:37.717]  And it's just the power-tripping government going completely insane.
[02:46:38.478 --> 02:46:41.460]  But shifting gears back to G. Edward Griffin, G. Edward Griffin,
[02:46:43.210 --> 02:46:45.312]  I've seen these common law courts over and over again.
[02:46:45.352 --> 02:46:47.313]  People always get mad and say, no, they're real.
[02:46:47.373 --> 02:46:49.375]  This local guy says it is.
[02:46:49.415 --> 02:46:51.836]  And then people get arrested.
[02:46:51.856 --> 02:46:59.822]  If a city sets up an unlawful court, they get in trouble from the state.
[02:47:00.502 --> 02:47:01.983]  And it's all chartered through the state.
[02:47:02.764 --> 02:47:04.625]  And the state is out of control.
[02:47:04.665 --> 02:47:05.446]  We have to take it back.
[02:47:05.486 --> 02:47:09.669]  But what about these citizen courts we hear about and all of this?
[02:47:11.618 --> 02:47:16.859]  Well, I'm certainly not an expert on that, Alex, but I do have two rather strong thoughts on it.
[02:47:17.799 --> 02:47:39.923]  One is that I think they're dangerous because although the people who are forming them today appear to be well-motivated, they appear to be reacting in righteous indignation, which I'm glad to see that, reacting against all the bad things that are being done by their national and regional governments.
[02:47:40.623 --> 02:47:46.586]  Still, they go out and they form these courts and these militias, but they have no rules.
[02:47:46.827 --> 02:47:48.347]  They have no limitations.
[02:47:48.447 --> 02:47:52.730]  They're really like a lynch mob, in a way.
[02:47:52.750 --> 02:47:59.834]  There's no limit to their power, and really what they're doing is they're advocating the formation of a government.
[02:48:00.552 --> 02:48:08.479]  This is the essence of government, to use organized force to compel other people to comply with what you want them to do.
[02:48:09.059 --> 02:48:18.648]  So, although they're sure in their mind that what they want other people to do is right, I don't see any rules and regulations, I don't see any constitutions, I don't see any...
[02:48:20.189 --> 02:48:23.652]  Well, no, they're going to say they're following the common law and the Constitution.
[02:48:24.032 --> 02:48:28.316]  My issue is, the states are chartered by the people.
[02:48:28.696 --> 02:48:30.418]  We have the state constitutions.
[02:48:30.698 --> 02:48:32.479]  The counties are created through that.
[02:48:32.780 --> 02:48:34.521]  The cities are chartered by that.
[02:48:35.082 --> 02:48:38.725]  And Arte Civeta, without a law, can't go shut down a gun show.
[02:48:39.225 --> 02:48:43.208]  And so the only way these courts have any basis is a citizen's arrest.
[02:48:43.669 --> 02:48:47.192]  I mean, when you have lawless police operating outside the common law,
[02:48:47.552 --> 02:48:48.694]  Shutting down a gun show.
[02:48:48.974 --> 02:48:55.523]  The citizens have an innate right to say no to it, but the problem is the criminal government's going to come after you.
[02:48:56.264 --> 02:48:59.969]  Well, yeah, that's the other issue that, uh, Senator, two thoughts came to mind.
[02:49:00.250 --> 02:49:04.115]  The other issue is that even if all these constitutional issues were solved,
[02:49:05.151 --> 02:49:06.952]  How are they going to enforce it sooner or later?
[02:49:06.972 --> 02:49:13.559]  They're going to have to be able to get in the trenches and shoot it out with the established so-called authorities.
[02:49:13.699 --> 02:49:15.301]  Yeah, they're playing a new game now.
[02:49:16.042 --> 02:49:21.908]  They're trying to say that they're a new government to the big mafia government instead of taking the system of the government back.
[02:49:22.268 --> 02:49:24.731]  And all I'm saying is, folks, don't play in traffic.
[02:49:25.211 --> 02:49:33.558]  I mean, I think it's fine if you have committees and meetings and videotape it and hand out the Citizens Commission verdict and then go to the grand jury with it.
[02:49:34.458 --> 02:49:37.441]  And, you know, I think it's great to investigate or sue politicians.
[02:49:37.881 --> 02:49:43.946]  I've just, I mean, how many times have we read about these citizen courts and they go off and do something and then it turns into a nightmare?
[02:49:44.306 --> 02:49:44.927]  Yeah, right.
[02:49:45.327 --> 02:49:49.432]  Well, yeah, there's no... I like your expression, don't play in traffic, it's very dangerous.
[02:49:50.153 --> 02:49:52.315]  And I don't think people have thought it all the way through.
[02:49:53.537 --> 02:49:59.304]  Well, anyway, I've written a little bit on vigilante action, and that's very close to this topic.
[02:49:59.924 --> 02:50:00.084]  Yeah.
[02:50:16.870 --> 02:50:19.231]  G. Edward, we're out of time.
[02:50:19.612 --> 02:50:21.353]  I want to thank you for coming on, but I want to add this.
[02:50:21.853 --> 02:50:24.774]  Covert vigilantism has done some good.
[02:50:24.794 --> 02:50:29.137]  The issue is, these people think by saying they have a court, that makes it legal.
[02:50:29.517 --> 02:50:33.219]  If you're going to be a vigilante, you better watch your butt and be secretive.
[02:50:33.519 --> 02:50:34.519]  G. Edward, great job.
[02:50:34.579 --> 02:50:35.400]  Thanks for coming on with us.

[02:50:45.547 --> 02:50:50.789]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[02:50:50.809 --> 02:50:53.629]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[02:50:53.649 --> 02:50:57.991]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:50:58.991 --> 02:51:03.432]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.
