[00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:04.911]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:06.611]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.331 --> 00:00:08.452]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:09.892]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:11.613]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.213 --> 00:00:15.854]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.414 --> 00:00:20.476]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:26.036]  It is Wednesday, the 11th day of August, 2010.
[00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:30.439]  We had him on last week, but we ran out of time.
[00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:34.582]  I want to have him back on today for a full hour and a half to take your phone calls.
[00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:41.246]  The always informative and thought-provoking Alan Watt will be joining us coming up in T-minus one hour and 30 minutes.
[00:00:44.048 --> 00:00:51.390]  We have a lot of key stacks of information and news here in front of us today, and we'll also have open phones.
[00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.672]  Let me just begin with some of the news headlines here that we'll be covering after the break.
[00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:00.213]  Iraq needs U.S.
[00:01:00.253 --> 00:01:02.294]  military support until 2020.
[00:01:02.994 --> 00:01:03.954]  What a surprise.
[00:01:04.054 --> 00:01:07.115]  Seven years ago, that was the Pentagon's official position.
[00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:10.536]  Of course, they lie to the public and say, oh, we're leaving next year.
[00:01:10.556 --> 00:01:13.117]  And then the next year comes, oh, we're leaving the year after that.
[00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.191]  Don't say that we lied to you.
[00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:18.712]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[00:01:18.752 --> 00:01:20.473]  If you question anything, government does.
[00:01:21.153 --> 00:01:26.477]  Fears of Al Qaeda return in Iraq as U.S.-backed fighters defect.
[00:01:26.937 --> 00:01:37.343]  You mean they're paid to stage more terror attacks as a pretext to stay, as they've been caught repeatedly on record, including British Special Forces staging terror attacks against Iraqis and U.S.
[00:01:37.383 --> 00:01:37.704]  forces.
[00:01:38.624 --> 00:01:41.347]  That's London Guardian, Times of London, all admitted.
[00:01:41.988 --> 00:01:44.971]  Continuing, will Iraq fall victim to the oil curse?
[00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:45.932]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:01:46.853 --> 00:01:56.864]  More on Google and Verizon, announcing that they're seizing the once free internet as it is known and taking control of it in our society.
[00:01:56.984 --> 00:01:58.906]  That is coming up as well.
[00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:08.714]  Iran retaliates against sanctions is to, quote, drop all trade in filthy euro and the dollar.
[00:02:09.414 --> 00:02:11.535]  So that is being announced.
[00:02:11.575 --> 00:02:13.616]  We'll talk about what effects that will have on the economy.
[00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:18.277]  World stock markets are plunging globally today and the dollar is up.
[00:02:18.877 --> 00:02:20.678]  They just race from currency to currency.
[00:02:21.158 --> 00:02:23.939]  Currencies go up, then they go down, but overall they're going down.
[00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.761]  Iran warns, we have dug mass graves for your soldiers in response to U.S.
[00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:29.521]  attack threat.
[00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:32.960]  So lots of saber-rattling going on back and forth.
[00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:39.985]  And Russia's gasoline plant resumed supply to Iran and trade, Reuters reports.
[00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:42.868]  And we'll be breaking down all of those developments.
[00:02:44.048 --> 00:02:53.193]  On the economy, CNBC has the headline, America is bankrupt in a Mickey Mouse economy similar to Russia in the 1990s.
[00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:56.655]  Peter Schiff says we're in the early stages of depression.
[00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:57.315]  I agree with him.
[00:02:57.835 --> 00:03:05.079]  And 15 economic statistics that just keep getting worse from the Economic Collapse website posted up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:06.320]  I'm going to be going over those.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:16.864]  Also, when university scientists found underwater oil plumes, the government said, shut up, don't tell anyone, and then tried to discredit them.
[00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:36.032]  And George Washington Blog, always does a great job, we carry it at InfoWars and Prison Planet, has boiled down all the mainstream scientists and major university heads that have been out in the Gulf studying it, saying it's still leaking upwards of 20 miles away, but the media says, and the government says, shut up.
[00:03:36.852 --> 00:03:45.500]  We say the oil spill is over and 70% cleaned up, which of course is total propaganda, but if you question it, you are a conspiracy theorist.
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.505]  If you question any forms of corruption or any problems, you are a conspiracy theorist.
[00:03:51.985 --> 00:04:00.132]  We have a C-SPAN clip where they had one of the former heads of counter-terrorism on, and he just, every time they called in and brought up government-sponsored terror and documents and
[00:04:01.093 --> 00:04:12.785]  Members of the military and the Pentagon going public about it, the 9-11 Commission going public, the guest and the host of the CNN Washington Journal, the C-SPAN Washington Journal, will just say, conspiracy theory!
[00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:14.386]  That's just their answer to everything.
[00:04:14.907 --> 00:04:23.014]  If you say Halliburton's corrupt conspiracy theory, if you say Enron's corrupt conspiracy theory, for 11 years if you said Bernie Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme, conspiracy theory,
[00:04:23.575 --> 00:04:25.636]  If you say taxes are too high, conspiracy theory.
[00:04:26.217 --> 00:04:28.578]  Or if you say you don't want government-run healthcare, you're a racist.
[00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:30.820]  It's just the default positions.
[00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:34.222]  That's just some of the news that's coming up.
[00:04:34.663 --> 00:04:40.527]  They're also announcing what I first saw about 12 years ago in the news, but now it's being pushed as legislation.
[00:04:40.907 --> 00:04:44.830]  Cameras in all cars watching you whenever you drive your car.
[00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.375]  And they're also announcing the major airlines to have cameras in them face scanning you and recording everything you do, including audio.
[00:04:53.973 --> 00:04:57.065]  Hey, if you put up with naked body scanners that bathe you in radiation, why not?
[00:04:57.085 --> 00:04:58.088]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.108 --> 00:04:58.470]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.093]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:05:04.193 --> 00:05:04.973]  What have we got?
[00:05:05.194 --> 00:05:07.315]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:05:07.656 --> 00:05:08.376]  A republic.
[00:05:08.656 --> 00:05:11.218]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:05:11.298 --> 00:05:13.220]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.462]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:16.863]  So they think they own our land?
[00:05:17.263 --> 00:05:18.404]  They think they own our water?
[00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:18.984]  Children?
[00:05:19.184 --> 00:05:19.985]  Our education?
[00:05:20.325 --> 00:05:20.926]  Our money?
[00:05:21.146 --> 00:05:24.789]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:28.795]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:05:30.137 --> 00:05:30.958]  We have the facts.
[00:05:31.158 --> 00:05:32.260]  We have the Constitution.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.201]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:34.062]  We have common law.
[00:05:34.123 --> 00:05:36.366]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:36.626 --> 00:05:40.412]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:05:40.512 --> 00:05:45.294]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:05:45.454 --> 00:05:46.835]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:05:46.955 --> 00:05:47.796]  Don't tread on me.

[00:06:58.865 --> 00:07:00.466]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:07:57.152 --> 00:07:57.572]  Thank you.
[00:07:59.653 --> 00:08:04.714]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.074 --> 00:08:07.335]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:25.298 --> 00:08:28.840]  It is Wednesday, the 11th day of August, 2010.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.603]  Alan Watt is coming up in about an hour and 22 minutes from now.
[00:08:33.643 --> 00:08:41.068]  We'll be joining us live on air to take your calls and cover the scientific dictatorship that we face as a human society.
[00:08:43.146 --> 00:08:55.237]  I want to go over the immigration developments, the fact the Democratic Party is in free fall, the Republican Party is in deep trouble as the public really awakens and has a full paradigm shift.
[00:08:56.198 --> 00:08:58.620]  We've also confirmed, we first reported on this,
[00:08:59.361 --> 00:09:00.081]  I don't know.
[00:09:15.567 --> 00:09:24.610]  But now it's been confirmed that some of the local newspapers in Kentucky were running reports about these provocateurs, including video reports.
[00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:36.673]  And so they're just all tied in together, running these type of false flags against candidates that are anti-globalist, pro-Republic, pro-freedom.
[00:09:37.053 --> 00:09:41.815]  So we'll also be getting into some of those reports today as well.
[00:09:44.124 --> 00:09:58.710]  But before I go any further, I want to give the toll-free number out to take your calls today, and I will be going to calls later in the hour, on any of the news items that I'm going to be mentioning going over, or any of the issues that you wish to discuss.
[00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.211]  We'll also look at the major decline in the stock markets.
[00:10:03.232 --> 00:10:08.818]  Not just here in the United States or Europe, but in Asia as well today, and what is behind that.
[00:10:09.218 --> 00:10:11.241]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:11.261 --> 00:10:14.024]  But first, let's get into this news and information.
[00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:32.343]  And later in the next hour, if I have time, I'm going to play a RT piece that I was on yesterday, where I was on for 11 minutes and covered two different subjects.
[00:10:33.364 --> 00:10:39.171]  A, the fact that net neutrality is being ended and the Internet as we know it is in the process of being dismantled.
[00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:41.893]  It will take several years, just under this current
[00:10:42.734 --> 00:10:46.735]  Uh, particular attack, but there's a multifaceted attack going on with this particular one.
[00:10:47.215 --> 00:10:49.076]  I will cripple it and ended as we know it.
[00:10:49.436 --> 00:11:07.101]  You won't be able to access and access InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but not just our sites, not just quote conspiracy sites that dare question the mainstream media and the government propaganda and disinformation lies, but just all sites that do not pay Verizon, Google and Time Warner and AT&T and
[00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:13.705]  Less than 10 of these mega telecommunications cartels that are now seizing the web.
[00:11:14.586 --> 00:11:20.110]  In the second part of the video, they brought up the fact that the airlines are now doing it.
[00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.031]  They're not talking about it.
[00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:24.272]  They're now beginning to deploy it.
[00:11:25.914 --> 00:11:28.175]  And that is cameras in every seat.
[00:11:28.816 --> 00:11:31.638]  When you're in an airplane, a commercial passenger jetliner,
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.968]  Of course you're facing, unless you're facing the bulkhead, you're facing the back seat.
[00:11:38.408 --> 00:11:41.533]  And you've got the tray there that you can lower down and the magazine rack.
[00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:50.716]  They are now going to put cameras in all of those that feed into a artificially intelligent computer system, they claim.
[00:11:50.736 --> 00:11:51.596]  It's pure quackery.
[00:11:52.277 --> 00:12:05.745]  And if you're sweating or if you go to the bathroom too much, it will alert a computer in the cockpit that will then alert Interpol and all other major police agencies on the earth.
[00:12:06.898 --> 00:12:10.823]  And it also has microphones, most importantly, recording everything you do.
[00:12:11.604 --> 00:12:16.690]  Everything you talk about with your children, your wife, your business partners who are flying with you.
[00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:21.395]  This is just the NSA, globally, announcing everything will be surveilled.
[00:12:22.036 --> 00:12:25.420]  In the last 20 years, it started in England 13 years ago.
[00:12:27.422 --> 00:12:46.224]  uh... in nineteen ninety seven in austin texas uh... now it's in every major western city and even small towns uh... when they announced them to the local slaves the cover story is always gunshot detectors now they've dispensed with that cover story and they said we're listening to you with microphones that are shotgun
[00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.533]  Meaning they can listen to you at upwards of 200 yards.
[00:12:49.934 --> 00:12:54.860]  The companies in city council presentations that we've covered around the country brag.
[00:12:55.301 --> 00:13:01.389]  The police at their threat fusion centers of course are just now being told about the microphones.
[00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:25.756]  They've put the grid in, tested, only the NSA and private corporations are allowed to access it and then now the police at higher levels are being federally and internationally deputized and becoming liaison to InfraGard, CIA, FBI databases, face scanning cameras, biometric cameras that scan your walk, cameras that actually project
[00:13:26.836 --> 00:13:29.439]  Uh, different millimeter waves that look through your clothes.
[00:13:29.459 --> 00:13:33.162]  Uh, they claim for weapons, but if you actually read the specs, it's a biometric scan.
[00:13:33.182 --> 00:13:46.215]  Uh, and of course the biometric fingerprint they receive when you go through the naked body scanners, or when you go to the upper echelon clothing stores for your, quote, uh, tailored fitting through the biometric scanners that are now in thousands of different locations around the world.
[00:13:46.555 --> 00:13:49.138]  It's all been second-party, third-party sold.
[00:13:50.559 --> 00:13:57.185]  That's why Target and Barnes and Nobles will offer you 10% off now every time you go in to buy something.
[00:13:57.485 --> 00:13:59.787]  At first it was just get the card, you get 10% the first time.
[00:14:00.127 --> 00:14:01.008]  Now it's every time.
[00:14:02.109 --> 00:14:08.254]  Because they're selling the data and they claim legally when you sign off on that, then they're allowed to sell your data.
[00:14:08.894 --> 00:14:15.100]  That's how they get around the government having to get a 5th Amendment or 4th Amendment or mainly 4th Amendment
[00:14:17.287 --> 00:14:18.208]  Warrant to do it.
[00:14:19.128 --> 00:14:25.793]  Remember in 2000, there was the headlines, scofflaws get caught when they order pizza.
[00:14:26.994 --> 00:14:29.015]  Guys, pull that up for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.597]  Just scofflaws get caught ordering pizzas.
[00:14:31.997 --> 00:14:33.758]  That's the headline USA Today.
[00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:38.341]  And it said the big three pizza companies that have more than half the market in the U.S.
[00:14:38.401 --> 00:14:44.085]  and it's now almost all the major pizza companies and other places you order for delivery.
[00:14:45.346 --> 00:14:46.227]  When they run your
[00:14:47.742 --> 00:14:49.207]  Phone number and your...
[00:14:50.236 --> 00:14:53.878]  I mean, the point is, everything is being integrated.
[00:14:53.898 --> 00:14:57.600]  Now, remember about 10 years ago, Toyota and General Motors as part of Pentagon grants
[00:15:20.492 --> 00:15:21.013]  I don't think so.
[00:15:35.523 --> 00:15:43.009]  That will then be punched in by the Pentagon, by the NSA, by the local federalization threat fusion centers.
[00:15:43.610 --> 00:16:03.707]  And then I saw a governor admit that of Wisconsin in 2003, that's in the film Matrix of Evil, 2004, mainstream Green Bay newspaper, with the governor said too much at a threat fusion center in Attura, and said we type in here, it calls up where you're at, real-time your cell phone, we type in here, it listens to your cell phone even if it's off,
[00:16:04.167 --> 00:16:07.890]  And we type in here, and in the future there'll be cameras tracking him.
[00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.172]  And so that's all mainstream news now today.
[00:16:11.893 --> 00:16:14.595]  And it's just going in, and it's just the way it is.
[00:16:15.175 --> 00:16:22.161]  And again, it's to totally surveil and have AI computers listening to every word you say, and they're just announcing it in your face.
[00:16:22.441 --> 00:16:25.683]  Has nothing to do with CIA-run men that live in caves.
[00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:26.124]  Okay?
[00:16:26.644 --> 00:16:27.405]  Let's just be clear.
[00:16:27.625 --> 00:16:29.827]  They fund them to kill our troops, keep the war going.
[00:16:31.027 --> 00:16:33.568]  They both fund the opposition and the war itself.
[00:16:33.588 --> 00:16:35.289]  It's called full-spectrum dominance.
[00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.849]  Now, there it is.
[00:16:36.869 --> 00:16:39.710]  Missouri tracks scoff laws via pizza delivery databases.
[00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.210]  USA Today.
[00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:48.032]  And that is actually 2004, but I first saw that in 2000.
[00:16:48.593 --> 00:16:50.233]  There it is for you.
[00:16:50.873 --> 00:16:51.954]  Okay, let's continue.
[00:16:52.074 --> 00:16:55.735]  In-flight surveillance could foil terrorists in the sky.
[00:16:57.338 --> 00:17:02.700]  And it goes on to say, the Big Brother is not bad now, Big Brother is there to help you.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.421]  And that's also in the TV piece.
[00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:13.944]  When they interview one of the scientists, a computer scientist that's developed this, he says, Big Brother's not bad, Big Brother is here to help.
[00:17:14.344 --> 00:17:17.765]  And of course, in 1984, Big Brother was there, a watchful Big Brother.
[00:17:18.606 --> 00:17:24.428]  And it goes on, CCTV cameras are bringing more and more public places under surveillance.
[00:17:25.342 --> 00:17:26.984]  And passenger aircraft could be next.
[00:17:28.165 --> 00:17:30.187]  Well, actually, they've announced the purchases are being made.
[00:17:31.248 --> 00:17:35.992]  A prototype European system uses multiple cameras and Big Brother software, that's what they call it.
[00:17:36.293 --> 00:17:48.204]  See, it's all in your face, to try and automatically detect terrorists or other dangers caused by passengers, the European Union, security and aircraft in future European environment, or SAFE.
[00:17:49.045 --> 00:17:57.513]  A project uses the camera in every passenger seat with six wide-angle cameras, per individual, to survey the aisles.
[00:17:58.294 --> 00:18:07.783]  Software analyzes the footage to detect developing terrorist activity on air rage incidents by tracking passengers' facial expressions.
[00:18:09.417 --> 00:18:10.938]  These are already in most airports.
[00:18:10.998 --> 00:18:11.718]  It's all quackery.
[00:18:11.738 --> 00:18:12.218]  They walk over.
[00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:12.819]  You're sweating.
[00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:18.181]  Yeah, I just hauled my stuff out of the parking garage 300 yards.
[00:18:18.221 --> 00:18:19.502]  And it's 103 degrees out there.
[00:18:19.522 --> 00:18:20.882]  And yeah, I'm sweating.
[00:18:21.743 --> 00:18:22.543]  Well, you look irritated.
[00:18:23.064 --> 00:18:25.024]  Yeah, I happen to have a stomachache.
[00:18:26.425 --> 00:18:29.086]  Or I just happen to get a call that I'm being audited.
[00:18:30.167 --> 00:18:31.007]  Yeah, I'm in a bad mood.
[00:18:31.247 --> 00:18:34.749]  Or I just got a call that my wife was in a car wreck.
[00:18:34.829 --> 00:18:35.109]  Punk!
[00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:37.851]  Yeah, you bet I'm sweating and look angry.
[00:18:38.031 --> 00:18:38.531]  Yeah, you bet.
[00:18:39.738 --> 00:18:41.139]  I'm even more angry talking to you.
[00:18:42.201 --> 00:18:43.862]  Everybody knows your boss is Blue 9-11.
[00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:46.565]  Everybody knows you staged Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:18:46.745 --> 00:18:51.611]  Everybody knows those radiation machines are going to roast my genitals and give me skin cancer.
[00:18:52.191 --> 00:18:53.753]  Everybody knows you're saving the images.
[00:18:54.614 --> 00:18:56.956]  Everybody knows you're paid $14 an hour to be a pervert.
[00:18:57.176 --> 00:18:58.358]  Everybody knows it's a fraud.
[00:18:59.219 --> 00:19:00.420]  That's what I really want to say to you.
[00:19:04.397 --> 00:19:09.061]  But in some news reports it's to fight terrorists, in others it's for anger on the airplanes.
[00:19:09.701 --> 00:19:17.168]  I mean, I've been on these airplanes and either the flight attendants, the stewardesses, ooh political correctness, I just violated a thought crime saying stewardess.
[00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:24.134]  If you... They're either real nice or they're looking for trouble.
[00:19:25.315 --> 00:19:27.957]  I've seen them puff up to people, bow up to people.
[00:19:30.728 --> 00:19:31.889]  And see, that's how tyranny works.
[00:19:32.009 --> 00:19:36.672]  All these little petty people get this petty thuggism through the system and they get to oppress you.
[00:19:37.493 --> 00:19:45.518]  So I thought we'd go over that and then CBS News is announcing a federal legislation where everything you do in your car will be watched by video.
[00:19:45.558 --> 00:19:46.639]  It's all part of freedom.
[00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:52.823]  And major police chiefs in Houston and other major cities are proposing cameras in all homes.
[00:19:54.284 --> 00:19:56.345]  And if you don't like it, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:19:56.365 --> 00:19:58.827]  See, now being a conspiracy theorist just means you don't like tyranny.

[00:21:01.598 --> 00:21:06.482]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:21:07.363 --> 00:21:18.572]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:21:19.452 --> 00:21:27.018]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:31.362]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.
[00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:47.579]  Now I'm offering 50 all-organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planter, and a CD teaching you how to save seeds so your children's children will always have healthy food.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.241]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:21:51.161 --> 00:21:56.605]  I'm Vic John Lipscomb and my company is survivalistseeds.com.
[00:22:00.313 --> 00:22:04.157]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:22:04.197 --> 00:22:05.438]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:22:05.599 --> 00:22:09.182]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:22:09.483 --> 00:22:11.985]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:22:12.386 --> 00:22:14.127]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:22:14.468 --> 00:22:16.770]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:22:17.811 --> 00:22:23.414]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:22:23.454 --> 00:22:25.935]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:22:33.499 --> 00:22:35.380]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[00:23:01.069 --> 00:23:02.512]  What is a wind generator?
[00:23:02.812 --> 00:23:04.916]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:08.242]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[00:23:08.583 --> 00:23:10.526]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?

[00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:53.090]  That's 800-976-0026.
[00:24:06.621 --> 00:24:16.024]  Okay, let's play the second half of my RT interview yesterday, where they go to a news package about anti-terror cameras analyzing your behavior.
[00:24:16.204 --> 00:24:18.865]  This is literal pre-crime, thought crime.
[00:24:19.405 --> 00:24:27.748]  Then we'll come back in the next segment and I'll continue to analyze how they're now going to roll out with cameras in your cars, with audio, watching everything you do.
[00:24:27.988 --> 00:24:28.428]  Here it is.
[00:24:28.448 --> 00:24:30.809]  And then RT's Laura Emmett has the latest.
[00:24:32.648 --> 00:24:34.269]  Off for a week in the sun.
[00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:42.273]  But if a European Union project goes ahead, these people could have their conversations and movements monitored while they're flying.
[00:24:42.773 --> 00:24:48.616]  The plan has alarmed civil liberties campaigners who fear further growth in the surveillance state.
[00:24:49.077 --> 00:24:50.577]  But air passengers are divided.
[00:24:50.597 --> 00:24:52.318]  Yeah, I think that's bad.
[00:24:52.578 --> 00:24:59.182]  Just because it's like private and personal, you wouldn't... I don't know, I think there's a line and they keep pushing it and pushing it with like the regulations and...
[00:24:59.892 --> 00:25:03.414]  I think it's so prevalent already, with this expected.
[00:25:03.515 --> 00:25:08.518]  You watch TV on land, you watch TV in the air, you'll be surveilled on land, you'll be surveilled in the air.
[00:25:08.538 --> 00:25:09.379]  It doesn't worry me.
[00:25:09.899 --> 00:25:12.861]  I've got nothing to hide, so it wouldn't worry me, personally.
[00:25:13.462 --> 00:25:23.589]  The EU project is aimed at tackling terrorism by analysing the way passengers behave in a bid to isolate potential bombers or hijackers when they're already on board.
[00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:29.253]  At the moment, surveillance on planes is mainly limited to a CCTV camera near the cockpit.
[00:25:29.775 --> 00:25:37.278]  Britons are the most watched people in the world, with more CCTV cameras per capita than any other nation.
[00:25:37.898 --> 00:25:42.260]  There are cameras on motorways, in train stations and in airports.
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:47.963]  And it's here at the University of Reading that the new in-flight surveillance system is being developed.
[00:25:48.463 --> 00:25:55.166]  It won't just include cameras, there'll also be microphones and special systems for monitoring unusual behaviour.
[00:25:55.726 --> 00:26:04.350]  Behavior the system will eventually be able to pick up includes sweating, moving around the cabin in an erratic way, and repeated visits to the toilet.
[00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:10.513]  Dr. James Ferryman insists it will distinguish between potential terrorists and nervous flyers.
[00:26:11.013 --> 00:26:15.236]  Now, one way we could do that is to look very carefully at the types of cues that we detect.
[00:26:15.276 --> 00:26:20.040]  So, for example, someone may be acting nervously or anxiously, perhaps sweating.
[00:26:20.621 --> 00:26:22.922]  In isolation, of course, that doesn't say anything.
[00:26:22.962 --> 00:26:24.524]  It could be just, again, a nervous flyer.
[00:26:25.164 --> 00:26:26.185]  But it could be a terrorist.
[00:26:26.705 --> 00:26:32.009]  But we only know that when we combine this information with other sources of information that come to play.
[00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:36.153]  I like to think of it as not Big Brother watching you, but Big Brother looking after you.
[00:26:36.696 --> 00:26:38.597]  Not everyone sees it that way.
[00:26:39.038 --> 00:26:45.723]  Campaigners say privacy is one of the litmus tests for a democracy and mass surveillance erodes it enormously.
[00:26:48.829 --> 00:26:57.433]  And that completely contradicts the main tenets of democratic law, which is that everyone is innocent until they are proven to be guilty.
[00:26:57.834 --> 00:27:12.021]  Continuing surveillance, mass surveillance, video communications, whatever the many ways that seem to just be creeping forward, completely goes against that and completely is a thorn in democracy.
[00:27:12.972 --> 00:27:17.994]  Apart from the civil rights issues, many question the efficacy of an on-board system.
[00:27:18.595 --> 00:27:25.898]  If a terrorist isn't caught at the airport, they say by the time a plane's 30,000 feet up, isn't it already too late?
[00:27:26.698 --> 00:27:28.739]  Laura Emmett, RT, London.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.841]  That was RT's Laura Emmett, but I want to bring Alex back into this conversation.
[00:27:33.901 --> 00:27:39.304]  So you heard one guy say in that story, Big Brother's not watching you, Big Brother's looking after you.
[00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:41.665]  What do you make about the surveillance now in the air?
[00:27:42.964 --> 00:27:46.166]  Well, in 1984, Big Brother was helping you.
[00:27:46.226 --> 00:27:48.547]  I mean, Big Brother didn't come out and say, we're oppressing you.
[00:27:48.947 --> 00:27:51.068]  This is the scientific dictatorship.
[00:27:51.108 --> 00:27:54.230]  They're training everyone to have everything you do recorded.
[00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:59.833]  Twelve years ago, they put microphones up around Austin, where I live, and said, oh, they're gunshot detectors.
[00:27:59.893 --> 00:28:01.294]  Now they admit it's just a surveillance.
[00:28:01.894 --> 00:28:02.194]  I don't know.
[00:28:22.848 --> 00:28:31.472]  out of this and it's total quackery, a thought crime, where they say these cameras will analyze that you're sweating, maybe you're hot, maybe you've got an upset stomach.
[00:28:31.732 --> 00:28:47.879]  The point is, is that this is all aimed at free humanity and has nothing to do with men from Central Asia that are really funded by the CIA and Google and others are a big part of the face scanning cameras going in on the streets and all the surveillance.
[00:28:47.899 --> 00:28:49.219]  This is worse than 1984.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:56.628]  Alex, unfortunately, we're coming to an end, but it's always great to have you on.
[00:28:56.688 --> 00:28:58.090]  We hope to check out your website.
[00:28:58.150 --> 00:28:59.272]  Hopefully it's back and running.
[00:28:59.292 --> 00:29:01.294]  That was radio host Alex Jones.
[00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:02.611]  All right.
[00:29:02.771 --> 00:29:04.853]  Now, you heard that woman in the piece.
[00:29:04.893 --> 00:29:05.934]  Well, I have nothing to hide.
[00:29:06.074 --> 00:29:06.675]  Record me.
[00:29:06.755 --> 00:29:07.616]  Record the audio.
[00:29:08.276 --> 00:29:09.918]  Well, then how about a camera in your house?
[00:29:10.358 --> 00:29:11.520]  How about a camera in the bathroom?
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.861]  How about a camera in your shower?
[00:29:13.321 --> 00:29:15.604]  You're already letting them naked body scan you at the airport.
[00:29:16.144 --> 00:29:22.911]  They're training us in the airports and on the planes for what they plan to go mainline in the streets, at the courthouses,
[00:29:23.852 --> 00:29:27.834]  With mobile vans, with cameras on the street that scan through your clothes.
[00:29:28.475 --> 00:29:29.735]  We told you this years ago.
[00:29:30.336 --> 00:29:32.337]  Now it's all being announced.
[00:29:33.478 --> 00:29:38.401]  They are training us to live under total surveillance worse than 1984.
[00:29:38.901 --> 00:29:43.684]  And the one individual who was against it all in the peace says this is creeping surveillance.
[00:29:43.744 --> 00:29:44.564]  It isn't creeping.
[00:29:44.944 --> 00:29:45.685]  It's racing.
[00:29:45.745 --> 00:29:46.625]  It's galloping.
[00:29:46.705 --> 00:29:48.666]  It's going at light speed.
[00:29:49.727 --> 00:29:50.648]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.128 --> 00:29:52.649]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.637 --> 00:29:56.325]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.059 --> 00:30:03.282]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:03.602 --> 00:30:03.882]  Number 1.
[00:30:04.522 --> 00:30:07.664]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:07.945 --> 00:30:08.505]  Number 2.
[00:30:08.805 --> 00:30:13.368]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:13.688 --> 00:30:14.129]  It's true.
[00:30:14.429 --> 00:30:18.992]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:19.312 --> 00:30:19.852]  Number 3.
[00:30:20.132 --> 00:30:23.414]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:23.715 --> 00:30:27.417]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:27.617 --> 00:30:28.158]  Number 4.
[00:30:28.418 --> 00:30:30.780]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.564]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:34.864 --> 00:30:35.064]  Number 5.
[00:30:35.645 --> 00:30:39.568]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:39.808 --> 00:30:44.553]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:31:01.878 --> 00:31:05.401]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:31:05.681 --> 00:31:08.324]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:31:08.564 --> 00:31:13.568]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[00:32:02.907 --> 00:32:03.808]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:04.168 --> 00:32:07.689]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:07.709 --> 00:32:10.331]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:10.491 --> 00:32:15.754]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:16.194 --> 00:32:22.437]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:22.857 --> 00:32:28.398]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:32.500]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.001]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:37.281 --> 00:32:42.802]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:43.242 --> 00:32:46.183]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:46.783 --> 00:32:48.224]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:48.764 --> 00:32:49.204]  It's here.
[00:32:49.884 --> 00:32:56.911]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:11.085]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:33:11.565 --> 00:33:14.108]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:15.993 --> 00:33:25.319]  So, 10-12 years ago, I would read MIT, Pentagon documents, EU documents, where they plan to put cameras in all cars to watch you in real time.
[00:33:25.339 --> 00:33:29.462]  They even talked about how they would sell it, saying, well, 30-plus children in the U.S.
[00:33:29.542 --> 00:33:32.544]  die every year, on average, when they're left in hot cars.
[00:33:32.624 --> 00:33:45.132]  So we'll punish everyone, and we'll put pressure sensors in the front and back seats, that if the temperature goes above 100 degrees, the camera will turn on and call police and give them an image of whoever's in the car.
[00:33:45.652 --> 00:33:50.196]  Well, you go open your car in the summer, it's 100 degrees, you get in there and turn the A.C.
[00:33:50.316 --> 00:33:51.097]  on, it turns on.
[00:33:51.538 --> 00:33:59.345]  They admittedly, as we told you many years before, they came out and told the public that they were using OnStar to dial in without warrants and listen to you.
[00:34:00.026 --> 00:34:05.571]  All of this is admittedly designed to surveil everything you're doing.
[00:34:05.591 --> 00:34:07.192]  Remember five years ago, Google?
[00:34:08.086 --> 00:34:15.851]  Came out and announced a patent and then Yahoo was also in the news saying, well, we've got a patent too and we're going to deploy this.
[00:34:16.952 --> 00:34:20.974]  And it uses the microphones and cameras that are in all the new computers.
[00:34:21.414 --> 00:34:23.216]  But five years ago they were being phased in then.
[00:34:23.876 --> 00:34:26.698]  And they said, don't worry, humans aren't going to watch and listen to you.
[00:34:26.758 --> 00:34:34.503]  A computer, if it hears a dog barking or it will listen to what TV show you're watching, it will then know what ads to tailor and have pop up.
[00:34:35.283 --> 00:34:36.183]  Now, that's their cover.
[00:34:36.344 --> 00:34:38.965]  Of course, they'll then make profits out of their surveillance.
[00:34:39.285 --> 00:34:40.205]  That's one side of it.
[00:34:40.825 --> 00:34:53.530]  But the real, main, overarching reason they're doing this is to track everything you're really saying and doing, to be able to gauge you as an enemy, to understand how to propagandize you, to know what you're really saying in your home.
[00:34:53.971 --> 00:34:55.711]  You are being listened to illegally.
[00:34:56.071 --> 00:34:57.052]  You are being tracked.
[00:34:57.512 --> 00:35:21.865]  And now Schmidt, the head of Google, is in the news every two or three days saying, everything you do will be surveilled, there is no anonymity, there is no privacy, you're stupid, you don't know how to handle it, this is just the way it is, we're gonna do whatever we want, and yes, we work for the NSA and CIA, and yes, we're tracking everything, and yes, we've got white vans worldwide, not just photographing and videotaping your house and your street, but we're
[00:35:22.085 --> 00:35:31.258]  It's grabbing all of your wireless transmissions illegally, and we're just going to do it, and we're going to start taking over the web and shutting off what websites you can see, and that's just what we're going to do.
[00:35:34.107 --> 00:35:36.168]  He was in the news yesterday saying things like this.
[00:35:36.408 --> 00:35:39.850]  The head of Facebook calls you dumb effers that you trust him.
[00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:41.370]  He's selling all your data.
[00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:42.511]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:35:42.831 --> 00:35:44.652]  You thought your private pages were private.
[00:35:44.672 --> 00:35:46.012]  They've now made all that public.
[00:35:46.272 --> 00:35:47.133]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:35:47.433 --> 00:35:48.433]  They're selling it all.
[00:35:48.733 --> 00:35:49.594]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:35:49.874 --> 00:35:52.075]  Twitter's run by the CIA and State Department.
[00:35:52.335 --> 00:35:53.175]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:35:55.276 --> 00:35:56.237]  They're just doing it.
[00:35:57.117 --> 00:36:03.420]  And here's the creme de la creme or the coup de gras, the ultimate expression of it.
[00:36:05.233 --> 00:36:29.745]  Homeland Security three years ago had meetings and said they want to deploy until there was a public outcry that everyone when you go to the airport they go here is your taser bracelet that will deliver 50,000 volts into your arm and everyone will wear it and they even cut to people on the street saying I think it's great it will stop Al Qaeda the non-existent made-up Pentagon boogeyman.
[00:36:30.785 --> 00:36:42.474]  And so that's the final expression is I guess like the running man, you're all wearing a taser bracelet or I guess an explosive necklace around your neck that blows your head off if the government decides you're a threat.
[00:36:42.835 --> 00:36:47.198]  So the government and global corporations, they're more secretive than ever.
[00:36:48.699 --> 00:36:51.782]  They obsess over the public not knowing anything they're doing.
[00:36:52.262 --> 00:36:53.083]  They're offshore.
[00:36:53.143 --> 00:36:54.024]  They're above the law.
[00:36:54.064 --> 00:36:55.585]  They write the laws where they're exempt.
[00:36:58.021 --> 00:37:25.563]  But you have no privacy, you have no rights, and all of the military deployed at public places and landmarks in the last seven, eight years, nine years now, coming up on 9-11 anniversary, all of the militarization of police, all of the intimidation, all of the checkpoints, and the blood draw checkpoints, all of it is to buffalo you and to dominate you into full submission to them.
[00:37:26.303 --> 00:37:39.457]  Just completely giving up and letting the system get away with it and acclimating the public, the police, the courts, the enforcers, the media, the government people to accept something more Orwellian than 1984.
[00:37:42.282 --> 00:37:43.903]  And, oh, we're going to drug your water.
[00:37:43.943 --> 00:37:46.023]  And, oh, we're going to give you vaccines to make you happy.
[00:37:46.043 --> 00:37:47.164]  You'll never be upset again.
[00:37:47.184 --> 00:37:50.545]  And, oh, we are putting fluoride in the water to make you submit.
[00:37:50.565 --> 00:37:52.385]  It wasn't just for your teeth.
[00:37:52.485 --> 00:37:53.186]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:37:53.706 --> 00:37:57.827]  And, yeah, you know, girls are going into puberty at 3, 4, 5, 6 years old.
[00:37:58.147 --> 00:38:00.088]  Yeah, the bisphenol A gives you cancer.
[00:38:00.428 --> 00:38:01.068]  We don't care.
[00:38:01.108 --> 00:38:02.028]  It makes you submit.
[00:38:02.529 --> 00:38:05.169]  It makes boys infertile and fries women.
[00:38:05.229 --> 00:38:05.850]  Isn't it great?
[00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:06.830]  We're just going to do it.
[00:38:08.387 --> 00:38:28.349]  And then we have this eight-minute clip of C-SPAN with one of the former heads of counterterrorism on, from the Bush administration, and every caller called in, PluggingInfoWars.com, talking about all these top generals and people saying 9-11's an inside job, or how Building 7 wasn't hit by a plane and it's on video that they said, get back, we're blowing it up.
[00:38:28.989 --> 00:38:37.311]  And, or how six of the ten commissioners and three of the lawyers say it's a criminal cover-up and a lie, and he would just say conspiracy theory.
[00:38:37.671 --> 00:38:40.432]  And the host would say, oh, more conspiracy theorist.
[00:38:40.872 --> 00:38:43.892]  Just a nice, easy one-liner for the public.
[00:38:44.252 --> 00:38:46.873]  Sit down, shut up, and take it.
[00:38:49.334 --> 00:38:50.934]  And so here it is from Cryptome.
[00:38:52.295 --> 00:38:55.858]  But then they excise a piece of CBS News.
[00:38:56.579 --> 00:39:04.605]  Lawmakers are considering controversial new legislation this week that would allow vehicles to be equipped with dashboard cameras to record the movements leading up to accidents.
[00:39:04.966 --> 00:39:14.413]  The proposed law, AB-1942, would promote safer driving habits and reduce accidents by permitting video recorders to be installed on the windshield.
[00:39:14.894 --> 00:39:18.156]  The bill currently allows devices to record video, audio, how fast
[00:39:19.013 --> 00:39:26.625]  And which direction the vehicle is traveling, a history of where your car has been steering and brake performance, that's in the black box, and seat belt usage.
[00:39:26.905 --> 00:39:34.156]  Proponents say there are enough measures to avoid an invasion of privacy, but others call the proposal a huge overreach of government power.
[00:39:35.618 --> 00:39:46.543]  And it wires into that cell phone that's in the dash, that wires it all back to the Commissariat, back to the NKVD, back to Homeland Security.
[00:39:46.603 --> 00:39:50.925]  So they're just coming out with all of it now, flaunting it in our faces.
[00:39:51.385 --> 00:39:53.326]  They could care less what we think about it.
[00:39:53.706 --> 00:39:56.207]  And they're just attempting to dominate us.
[00:39:56.687 --> 00:39:58.568]  Yeah, we're saving the naked body scans.
[00:39:58.868 --> 00:40:04.551]  Yeah, we've been taking your baby's blood and giving it to the Pentagon secretly for 38 years, and we lied to you and said it was a blood test.
[00:40:05.251 --> 00:40:09.053]  Yeah, we called people that exposed us conspiracy theorists, but it's all true.
[00:40:09.393 --> 00:40:15.236]  Yeah, we're saving the images and bathing you in 20 to 50 times the radiation we previously said.
[00:40:15.336 --> 00:40:17.057]  Yes, we're a pack of criminal liars.
[00:40:17.657 --> 00:40:18.898]  That's just the way it is.
[00:40:21.639 --> 00:40:24.201]  Meanwhile, Paul Watson wrote a story yesterday that we didn't get to.
[00:40:24.501 --> 00:40:26.182]  Cybersecurity lie exposed.
[00:40:26.502 --> 00:40:28.283]  Power plants are not connected to the Internet.
[00:40:29.164 --> 00:40:44.023]  And in a Wall Street Journal article, they talk about, well, the Cybersecurity Act claims that it is to stop people hacking in to power plants and other infrastructure, critical infrastructure, but that's not what it does.
[00:40:45.267 --> 00:40:52.993]  They say, really, people have to get in with thumb drives and then steal data or put viruses in because they're not connected.
[00:40:53.553 --> 00:40:54.914]  It's all a hoax.
[00:40:55.515 --> 00:40:56.696]  It's all a lie.
[00:40:57.096 --> 00:41:02.880]  Now, I want to go to your phone calls right now, Adam, Austin, Ruth, Daniel, and others that are patiently holding.
[00:41:03.321 --> 00:41:09.025]  Then I'm going to get into CNBC, America is bankrupt, Mickey Mouse, economy.
[00:41:10.486 --> 00:41:12.668]  Peter Schiff says we're in the early stages of a depression.
[00:41:13.732 --> 00:41:16.094]  Fifteen economic statistics that just keep getting worse.
[00:41:16.114 --> 00:41:16.835]  We'll go over those.
[00:41:18.016 --> 00:41:32.792]  Also, more cover-ups about the ongoing fractured seafloor for up to 20 miles away, the Deepwater Horizon well, and all these top scientists and university professors and
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:40.764]  The Maritime Sciences Dean, they're all saying they've been told by the government, shut your mouth.
[00:41:41.524 --> 00:41:45.386]  Do not talk about what you've seen with your submarines or underwater cameras.
[00:41:45.786 --> 00:41:47.307]  Do not discuss it still leaking.
[00:41:47.667 --> 00:41:51.870]  We're telling the schmuck public to suck their thumb, and they like sucking their thumb.
[00:41:53.308 --> 00:41:59.231]  And they're lying and saying, Corexit's not bad for you, and there's no health problems, just like they said on 9-11 with the dust.
[00:41:59.771 --> 00:42:03.053]  And you will shut up or have your grant money taken!
[00:42:03.293 --> 00:42:04.994]  You will lie like the rest of us!
[00:42:05.794 --> 00:42:19.962]  You will drink bisphenol A, you will drink sodium fluoride, you will drink mercury, you will drink lead, you will drink lithium, you will enjoy it, and you will sit down and shut up and watch your five-year-old go into puberty and get breast cancer at 15.
[00:42:20.962 --> 00:42:22.723]  And you will get Alzheimer's at 35.
[00:42:22.783 --> 00:42:29.687]  You will sit down and you will eat GMO foods designed to sterilize all mammal species and give you cancer and all the major studies.
[00:42:29.927 --> 00:42:32.149]  You will sit down and you will shut up.
[00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:35.991]  And we're getting injections ready for you where you won't even be able to get upset anymore.
[00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:38.992]  And we're going to put taser bracelets on you to fly on planes.
[00:42:39.193 --> 00:42:42.494]  And we've got cameras and microphones going up, listening to everything you're doing.
[00:42:42.655 --> 00:42:43.315]  That's the way it is.
[00:42:43.355 --> 00:42:43.895]  It's freedom.
[00:42:44.135 --> 00:42:45.136]  Sit down and shut up.
[00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:46.317]  Madoff is good.
[00:42:46.537 --> 00:42:47.417]  Ken Lay is good.
[00:42:47.738 --> 00:42:48.678]  Al Gore is good.
[00:42:49.058 --> 00:42:49.539]  It's good!
[00:42:50.675 --> 00:42:51.676]  Sit down and love it!
[00:42:52.396 --> 00:42:52.776]  Love it!
[00:42:53.057 --> 00:42:53.917]  Trust your government!
[00:42:54.157 --> 00:42:54.918]  Love the banks!
[00:42:55.198 --> 00:42:56.319]  Love the New World Order!
[00:42:57.199 --> 00:42:59.141]  Don't listen to people that tell you we're in trouble!
[00:42:59.481 --> 00:43:00.702]  Don't stand up for freedom!
[00:43:00.962 --> 00:43:02.223]  Don't talk about the Bill of Rights!
[00:43:02.503 --> 00:43:05.085]  And they openly train police for at least 15 years.
[00:43:05.325 --> 00:43:09.868]  I mean, I've been breaking that for 15 years every time police and military send us their training manuals.
[00:43:10.328 --> 00:43:12.470]  The famous Phoenix thing from 13 years ago.
[00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.190]  That's in several of my films.
[00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:15.150]  The Phoenix Memo.
[00:43:15.531 --> 00:43:17.071]  Do they talk about the Constitution?
[00:43:17.271 --> 00:43:18.451]  Do they talk about the Bill of Rights?
[00:43:18.491 --> 00:43:19.311]  They're a terrorist.
[00:43:19.571 --> 00:43:20.732]  Are they into the Second Amendment?
[00:43:20.772 --> 00:43:21.472]  They're a terrorist.
[00:43:21.492 --> 00:43:22.572]  They're your sworn enemy.
[00:43:23.312 --> 00:43:26.353]  The gun owners, the conservatives, the returning veterans, they're the enemy.
[00:43:26.613 --> 00:43:33.154]  This criminal government stages terror attacks and hypes it to scare you into submission.
[00:43:33.254 --> 00:43:35.535]  They are terrorists by their own definition.
[00:43:35.555 --> 00:43:41.256]  Remember Governor Ridge, many years after we broke down the fact that terror alerts were being issued?
[00:43:42.691 --> 00:43:49.338]  For political gain to create fear and to get defense contractors, uh, contracts domestically?
[00:43:49.858 --> 00:43:54.783]  Governor Ridge wrote a book a year and a half ago saying, yeah, we issued him for political power and fear monger.
[00:43:55.003 --> 00:43:55.804]  That's terrorism!
[00:43:56.024 --> 00:43:57.025]  They are terrorists.
[00:43:57.286 --> 00:43:58.146]  They are criminals.
[00:43:58.407 --> 00:43:59.348]  They are murderers.
[00:43:59.388 --> 00:44:04.453]  They are a class of mafia scum using high-tech brainwashing to sell you on it.
[00:44:05.563 --> 00:44:12.549]  And now Cass Sunstein, in all his memos, and in other government memos that we've covered here, say they've lost all credibility.
[00:44:12.569 --> 00:44:20.476]  They want to start shutting the web down, ending net neutrality, and curtailing talk radio with local community boards that the government appoints.
[00:44:20.816 --> 00:44:24.659]  They appoint their fake jury, their fake... What does Soviet mean?
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.380]  It means committee.
[00:44:26.261 --> 00:44:30.605]  They appoint their local Soviets, and then they go and take the licenses.
[00:44:30.945 --> 00:44:32.927]  They're now proposing this of talk stations.
[00:44:33.766 --> 00:44:36.488]  Will talk stations roll over and just say whatever the government wants?
[00:44:36.928 --> 00:44:38.669]  Or will you stand up and defend America?
[00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:41.751]  We've now come to this point.
[00:44:42.252 --> 00:44:43.092]  It isn't a joke.
[00:44:43.553 --> 00:44:44.413]  It isn't a game.
[00:44:44.753 --> 00:44:45.734]  It isn't a drill.
[00:44:46.034 --> 00:44:46.995]  It's the real thing.
[00:44:47.275 --> 00:44:51.898]  It is not a dress rehearsal.
[00:44:52.038 --> 00:44:57.442]  You now have 42 million Americans on food stamps.
[00:44:57.702 --> 00:44:59.143]  Three months ago it was 40 million.
[00:45:02.537 --> 00:45:06.001]  We now have crowd waiting for housing vouchers gets rowdy.
[00:45:06.121 --> 00:45:07.723]  Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
[00:45:08.223 --> 00:45:18.355]  They're announcing all over the country over half of police and fire and you name it.
[00:45:19.983 --> 00:45:21.344]  Road repairs, all of it.
[00:45:21.364 --> 00:45:22.464]  You see it all over the news.
[00:45:23.304 --> 00:45:25.145]  In some towns, it's 70 plus percent.
[00:45:25.185 --> 00:45:28.307]  In other towns, it's 60 percent, 50 percent, 30 percent.
[00:45:28.727 --> 00:45:35.470]  Just massive layoffs of police, fire, EMTs, not fixing roads, but the taxes go up, up, up, up, up.
[00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:40.112]  Everything debt to made-off type bankers that made off with America.
[00:45:41.445 --> 00:45:43.006]  Literal Ponzi fraud.
[00:45:43.046 --> 00:45:44.086]  They made it out of nothing.
[00:45:44.346 --> 00:45:45.547]  They sell it to the states.
[00:45:45.587 --> 00:45:46.967]  They sell it to the pension funds.
[00:45:47.368 --> 00:45:49.869]  And then when it goes belly up, they come back and want even more.
[00:45:50.209 --> 00:45:52.730]  And we submit and grovel and do it.
[00:45:54.331 --> 00:45:55.051]  This just in.
[00:45:55.431 --> 00:45:57.312]  We're linking it up on InfoWars.com.
[00:45:57.652 --> 00:46:00.053]  Crowd waiting for housing vouchers gets rowdy.
[00:46:00.593 --> 00:46:01.894]  Do you know what's going to happen?
[00:46:03.215 --> 00:46:08.157]  They just funded, what, $23 billion to the states to keep all the welfare going.
[00:46:09.124 --> 00:46:14.166]  That's chicken feed compared to the $28 trillion the banks got themselves, where you're totally dependent on them.
[00:46:14.906 --> 00:46:15.966]  The federal government's hiring.
[00:46:16.306 --> 00:46:19.947]  The average federal employee is paid double what their civilian counterpart is paid.
[00:46:20.447 --> 00:46:22.208]  And I've heard bureaucrats defending it on air.
[00:46:22.568 --> 00:46:23.809]  They get pay increases.
[00:46:24.049 --> 00:46:24.729]  They're growing.
[00:46:24.769 --> 00:46:25.949]  Everything else is imploding.
[00:46:25.969 --> 00:46:34.832]  And they're going to sick the giant, dumbed-down welfare hordes on whatever's left of the middle class, saying, you want money?
[00:46:34.912 --> 00:46:36.112]  You want your chicken feed?
[00:46:36.572 --> 00:46:37.953]  You want to be taken care of?
[00:46:39.266 --> 00:46:42.709]  You've got to vote for total control or the chicken feed will stop.
[00:46:43.649 --> 00:46:51.556]  They've got a giant, kept, captive horde of people who don't know any better to be used as a weapon against what's left of this country.
[00:46:52.116 --> 00:46:54.038]  And Bill and Melinda Gates and the Ford Foundation.
[00:46:54.398 --> 00:46:55.519]  Ford Foundation, billions.
[00:46:55.579 --> 00:46:57.020]  Bill and Melinda Gates, tens of millions.
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:01.804]  To Mecha, La Raza, to control those groups as an outside army against the U.S.
[00:47:02.264 --> 00:47:03.425]  The country's going down.
[00:47:03.605 --> 00:47:04.646]  This is high treason.
[00:47:04.926 --> 00:47:06.167]  It's really happening.
[00:47:06.187 --> 00:47:06.547]  Here it is.
[00:47:07.288 --> 00:47:08.489]  Crowd waiting.
[00:47:10.964 --> 00:47:12.926]  For housing vouchers gets rowdy.
[00:47:13.307 --> 00:47:18.853]  A crowd of people hoping to get federal housing assistance became unruly Wednesday morning with reports of fights breaking out in the crowd.
[00:47:19.513 --> 00:47:22.777]  You seen people stampede folks to death at Walmart wanting PlayStation 2?
[00:47:23.758 --> 00:47:32.127]  Thousands of people were lined up at the Tri-City Shopping Center hoping to apply for a voucher for the East Point Housing Authority that will give them a discount on their rent.
[00:47:32.287 --> 00:47:33.708]  This is the new older army right here.
[00:47:34.148 --> 00:47:40.430]  People began lining up at the shopping center two days ago and Wednesday morning and the crowd had gathered about a thousand people.
[00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:42.731]  East Point Police, some wearing riot helmets.
[00:47:42.751 --> 00:47:46.293]  It's like out of Soylent Green where they have a food riot over the Soylent.
[00:47:47.053 --> 00:47:48.814]  I want Soylent Greens out!
[00:47:49.094 --> 00:47:51.255]  They're running low on the orange stuff.
[00:47:51.655 --> 00:47:53.036]  Oh my gosh, there's going to be a riot.
[00:47:53.256 --> 00:47:54.836]  Charlton Heston puts his helmet on.
[00:47:55.076 --> 00:47:55.897]  He's getting ready.
[00:47:57.179 --> 00:47:59.960]  Pull up Riot Scene from Soylent Green on YouTube.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:00.861]  I guarantee it's there.
[00:48:01.621 --> 00:48:03.362]  Riot Scene, Soylent Green.
[00:48:05.083 --> 00:48:06.883]  They've got the cops in their football helmets.
[00:48:07.003 --> 00:48:10.105]  That's where all this is going by design.
[00:48:10.725 --> 00:48:11.766]  Social engineering.
[00:48:14.727 --> 00:48:16.648]  What's going to happen as inflation starts to hit?
[00:48:17.048 --> 00:48:23.471]  I was listening to CNBC and Bloomberg on XM last night, driving home.
[00:48:24.637 --> 00:48:29.259]  And I was flipping from channel to channel, actually three channels, I forget the third one, and it was the same thing.
[00:48:29.279 --> 00:48:30.579]  They could have finished each other's sentences.
[00:48:30.939 --> 00:48:32.380]  The Federal Reserve's got to save us.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.721]  They are starting to monetize debt.
[00:48:36.001 --> 00:48:37.181]  You know what monetizing debt means?
[00:48:37.201 --> 00:48:37.982]  The Federal Reserve.
[00:48:40.903 --> 00:48:53.067]  They'll issue, they're talking about two trillion more, the money's created, and then the private banks get interest on money they create and keep for themselves.
[00:48:56.187 --> 00:49:04.496]  And then you will pay tax money, I will pay tax money, not just on the two-trill, but on the interest to them when they get it!
[00:49:06.979 --> 00:49:08.621]  Oh, you couldn't make up these scams!
[00:49:09.902 --> 00:49:16.649]  But you think the average yuppie that only cares about how their coach bag looks or posing at the deli window?
[00:49:17.711 --> 00:49:18.011]  You think?
[00:49:18.772 --> 00:49:23.018]  You had 90% that were self-sufficient in the 10 years of the Depression and 7 million starved to death.
[00:49:23.298 --> 00:49:33.190]  Now you got 95% that aren't self-sufficient, 90% that are urban, of the 10% that are rural only half, or 5% in the aggregate are self-sufficient.
[00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:36.054]  What do you think is going to happen to those of us that are self-sufficient?
[00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:42.032]  You think the cops and all the bureaucrats and all the welfare people and all the big fat cat bankers?
[00:49:42.392 --> 00:49:49.315]  Why do you think government's arming itself and hardening all its positions and putting up Constantino wire and training for riots against this?
[00:49:49.595 --> 00:49:54.257]  They stole everything and they set this up like a house of cards to fall right into their hands.
[00:49:54.817 --> 00:50:00.379]  And now they're getting ready to rape America and then slit America's throat and throw us in a ditch.
[00:50:01.039 --> 00:50:02.280]  But the good news is
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.602]  The people are waking up, the police are waking up, the military are waking up.
[00:50:06.782 --> 00:50:07.982]  But waking up isn't enough.
[00:50:08.743 --> 00:50:17.107]  Once they fully put us into cardiac, financial and societal arrest, once we fully collapse, it won't matter if you know the truth.
[00:50:17.427 --> 00:50:25.451]  You're going to have to make the decisions about submitting to the globalists and being killed slowly, or saying no and taking all the pain up front.
[00:50:26.292 --> 00:50:28.853]  But there's an old saying, pain is weakness leaving the body.
[00:50:29.293 --> 00:50:30.494]  What did Victor Hugo say?
[00:50:31.634 --> 00:50:32.675]  Adversity makes men
[00:50:34.241 --> 00:50:34.801]  What's the quote?
[00:50:35.562 --> 00:50:42.507]  Adversity makes men, and plenty makes monsters?
[00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:45.148]  Well, you're gonna get tested now.
[00:50:45.769 --> 00:50:53.134]  You're toe-to-toe up against a scientific kill grid, and fights and riots are now breaking out for people wanting their free goodies.
[00:50:55.175 --> 00:50:57.116]  Can you imagine what these hordes are gonna do?
[00:50:57.136 --> 00:50:57.937]  They're gonna be used as a weapon.
[00:50:59.773 --> 00:51:01.034]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:01.074 --> 00:51:06.416]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:06.657 --> 00:51:11.299]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:11.679 --> 00:51:12.079]  It's true.
[00:51:12.159 --> 00:51:14.741]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:51:14.961 --> 00:51:16.722]  And it's possible that it could even happen again.
[00:51:17.242 --> 00:51:21.945]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:22.486 --> 00:51:24.407]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:51:24.787 --> 00:51:29.390]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:30.491]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:30.711 --> 00:51:33.473]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:51:33.773 --> 00:51:37.075]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[00:51:48.802 --> 00:51:56.124]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:56.424 --> 00:51:58.885]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:51:59.725 --> 00:52:02.046]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:02.106 --> 00:52:04.327]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:04.427 --> 00:52:07.247]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:07.627 --> 00:52:12.389]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:12.749 --> 00:52:16.930]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:19.571]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:19.591 --> 00:52:22.132]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:25.053]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:25.394 --> 00:52:32.997]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:33.317 --> 00:52:38.582]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:38.722 --> 00:52:41.005]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.565 --> 00:52:45.008]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.269 --> 00:52:46.210]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:47.631]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:47.671 --> 00:52:48.692]  Invisible Empire.

[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:04.181]  This is the police.
[00:54:04.201 --> 00:54:05.142]  This is the police.
[00:54:05.262 --> 00:54:06.523]  I'm asking you to disperse.
[00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:08.905]  The supply of soil and green has been exhausted.
[00:54:09.006 --> 00:54:11.668]  You must evacuate the area.
[00:54:11.688 --> 00:54:13.069]  The scoops are on their way.
[00:54:13.089 --> 00:54:15.071]  The scoops are on their way.
[00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:16.972]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[00:54:52.534 --> 00:54:53.575]  Here come the bulldozers.
[00:54:53.595 --> 00:54:55.195]  Scoop the people up and put them in the paddy wagons.
[00:54:55.275 --> 00:54:56.316]  Just another one of your plays.
[00:54:56.376 --> 00:54:56.976]  You're a pretend girl.
[00:54:56.996 --> 00:54:58.217]  What if I say I will never surrender?
[00:54:58.257 --> 00:54:59.458]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[00:54:59.478 --> 00:55:01.099]  What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
[00:55:27.368 --> 00:55:28.870]  I have studied society.
[00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:30.672]  I have studied mass movements.
[00:55:30.813 --> 00:55:34.137]  I have studied history, anthropology, sociology.
[00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:37.373]  I know what's going to happen.
[00:55:37.533 --> 00:55:39.875]  We told you we're going into a design depression.
[00:55:40.155 --> 00:55:44.398]  We told you they were going to put cameras and face scanners in the airplanes and in your cars.
[00:55:44.758 --> 00:55:46.819]  We told you they were taking your baby's blood at birth.
[00:55:47.059 --> 00:55:49.481]  We told you they were poisoning the water and food supply.
[00:55:49.901 --> 00:55:52.823]  We're telling you they're planning World War III with Iran.
[00:55:53.383 --> 00:56:00.388]  We're telling you that we are all under attack by the scientific dictatorship and we must come together.
[00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:04.511]  To government enforcers on petty power trips who work for the system.
[00:56:05.092 --> 00:56:06.112]  You are with the people.
[00:56:06.712 --> 00:56:09.894]  You are on our team, whether you consciously know it or not.
[00:56:10.314 --> 00:56:21.499]  And whether you consciously and societally and spiritually decide to join free humanity or not, you are being destroyed incrementally and covertly as well.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.041]  And the scenes of Soylent Green
[00:56:27.188 --> 00:56:31.951]  Simply mirror what happened in Rome 2,000 years ago and what happens in African cities every day.
[00:56:33.091 --> 00:56:34.432]  This is coming here.
[00:56:35.853 --> 00:56:42.436]  And out of the crisis, it's in the IMF World Bank documents that were secretly leaked in 2002, covered by Greg Pallas and the BBC.
[00:56:43.397 --> 00:56:45.078]  He broke it here before he even ran the story.
[00:56:46.598 --> 00:56:52.582]  That they plan to implode societies, not just the third world, and cause riots and cause the middle class to be afraid.
[00:56:52.922 --> 00:57:00.007]  They then control the underclass and use them as a weapon against the middle class to destroy it, but the middle class can't see it.
[00:57:00.367 --> 00:57:02.829]  Sides with the ruling class to their own destruction.
[00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:05.711]  It's all three-dimensional, high-level
[00:57:06.531 --> 00:57:06.951]  Chess.
[00:57:07.571 --> 00:57:10.692]  It's like playing ten chess games at once is basically the New World Order.
[00:57:11.052 --> 00:57:13.573]  They understand all these multi-facet variants.
[00:57:14.113 --> 00:57:15.294]  I read their own white papers.
[00:57:15.434 --> 00:57:16.274]  I document them.
[00:57:16.594 --> 00:57:21.776]  I showed you yesterday from the Rockefeller Foundation how they've got vaccines to reduce your fertility.
[00:57:22.516 --> 00:57:25.397]  How they talk about how it can only sterilize some or you'll notice.
[00:57:26.237 --> 00:57:27.758]  I mean, it's all admitted.
[00:57:27.818 --> 00:57:28.378]  You understand?
[00:57:28.418 --> 00:57:29.718]  It's not my opinion.
[00:57:29.738 --> 00:57:30.379]  We're going to break.
[00:57:30.679 --> 00:57:31.659]  We're starting the second hour.
[00:57:31.719 --> 00:57:34.500]  I'm going directly to Adam and others that are patiently holding.
[00:57:35.486 --> 00:57:41.873]  But before I go any further, we had a big response yesterday to folks buying t-shirts, books, videos, materials.
[00:57:42.374 --> 00:57:43.455]  We are an info war.
[00:57:43.535 --> 00:57:46.319]  We are a weapon of liberty against the globalists.
[00:57:46.759 --> 00:57:47.880]  And we're devastating them.
[00:57:48.641 --> 00:57:50.664]  That's why they're coming after us from above and below.
[00:57:51.732 --> 00:57:56.254]  From government sources, mainstream media, and alternative media, that's why we're under the total attack.
[00:57:56.575 --> 00:57:59.056]  Because when you're over the target, you're under attack.
[00:57:59.116 --> 00:58:00.657]  And no one is under greater attack than us.
[00:58:00.957 --> 00:58:07.821]  It is a blessing from God, and a signet, a standard, a symbol of our accuracy.
[00:58:08.361 --> 00:58:11.563]  And I enjoy it, and thank God for the blessings of persecution.
[00:58:12.813 --> 00:58:13.573]  Get the videos.
[00:58:13.894 --> 00:58:14.174]  Get them.
[00:58:14.314 --> 00:58:14.854]  Make copies.
[00:58:14.874 --> 00:58:15.895]  Get them out to everyone you know.
[00:58:16.015 --> 00:58:17.656]  Buy the t-shirts, the books, the materials.
[00:58:17.936 --> 00:58:21.458]  Support us so we can go to the next level in the face of this onslaught.
[00:58:23.019 --> 00:58:27.722]  Where else can you say that something is more on the tip of the spear than this broadcast and my films and my websites?
[00:58:28.322 --> 00:58:28.842]  Go to InfoWars.
[00:58:28.882 --> 00:58:32.785]  We've got incredible specials where you buy one video, get three free.
[00:58:33.165 --> 00:58:34.045]  InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:34.085 --> 00:58:35.146]  Second hour, straight ahead!
[00:58:40.939 --> 00:58:42.806]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.967 --> 00:58:54.588]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:54.928 --> 00:59:03.050]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:59:03.791 --> 00:59:07.812]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:59:08.412 --> 00:59:19.235]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:59:19.855 --> 00:59:28.878]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:29.378 --> 00:59:34.439]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:59:34.799 --> 00:59:41.981]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:42.281 --> 00:59:45.042]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:59:52.188 --> 00:59:54.094]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.575 --> 00:59:57.343]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.232 --> 01:00:08.414]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.054 --> 01:00:09.874]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.635 --> 01:00:11.575]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.195 --> 01:00:15.837]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.377 --> 01:00:20.499]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.319 --> 01:00:25.681]  Thank you for joining us now into hour number two of this Wednesday, 11th day of August, 2010 transmission.
[01:00:27.762 --> 01:00:30.904]  Simulcasting on a growing number of wonderful AM and FM affiliates.
[01:00:31.425 --> 01:00:35.548]  Simulcasting on Global Shortwave, TheInternetAndInfoWars.com, and XM Radio.
[01:00:36.028 --> 01:00:42.533]  By the way, XM carries three hours of the show on the weekends, re-airs it, and carries one hour every night of the three-hour daytime show.
[01:00:42.873 --> 01:00:48.998]  They're very close to picking up all three hours, so subscribe to XM, Sirius, and let them know why you are subscribing.
[01:00:49.018 --> 01:00:50.859]  We're reaching a lot of people that way as well.
[01:00:51.339 --> 01:00:55.222]  And it shows how this information has become so mainstream, which is good!
[01:00:55.242 --> 01:00:55.923]  We're beginning to win!
[01:00:57.011 --> 01:01:00.793]  That the system is capitulating to the truth.
[01:01:01.173 --> 01:01:06.795]  Because a lot of people at high levels are realizing they are in the crosshairs as well, and that's the key.
[01:01:07.355 --> 01:01:11.597]  Coming up, superbug that is resistant to most powerful antibiotics has reached the UK.
[01:01:11.857 --> 01:01:13.298]  This will be their next swine flu hype.
[01:01:13.678 --> 01:01:17.540]  Also, tainted Chinese baby milk powder causes baby girls to grow breasts.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.380]  All by design.
[01:01:20.881 --> 01:01:23.082]  Here in the United States, the exact same thing's going on.
[01:01:23.142 --> 01:01:25.223]  Three-year-olds becoming fertile.
[01:01:26.354 --> 01:01:26.715]  All right.
[01:01:27.336 --> 01:01:30.484]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls here on this live broadcast.
[01:01:30.925 --> 01:01:32.589]  Adam in Missouri, you're on the air.
[01:01:33.811 --> 01:01:35.876]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:01:35.896 --> 01:01:36.618]  I appreciate it.
[01:01:37.467 --> 01:01:42.669]  And, uh, I have a question I was hoping you can also, uh, ask Alan Watt when he comes on the air.
[01:01:42.689 --> 01:01:58.654]  Um, you know, I've done research, uh, as far as, you know, the New World Order, um, you know, and it leads me to, you know, the Trilateral Commission, then it leads me to the Bilderberg Group, then it leads me to the Illuminati, then it leads me to the Jesuits, so forth and so on.
[01:01:58.694 --> 01:02:03.556]  I'm just kind of wondering, A, what is the definition of the rabbit hole, and B,
[01:02:04.597 --> 01:02:07.058]  Who do you think is at the end of that rabbit hole?
[01:02:07.758 --> 01:02:17.602]  The driving force behind this whole... Because you said yourself, it's been going on in history, and so I'm wondering, what is that driving force that keeps perpetuating this?
[01:02:17.783 --> 01:02:20.124]  I mean, it's an excellent question.
[01:02:20.224 --> 01:02:24.265]  If you look, and we'll ask Alan that question coming up, but I know what he's going to say.
[01:02:24.325 --> 01:02:28.767]  The priests clashed of Egypt and Babylon and Greece, Cicero 3,000 years ago,
[01:02:31.395 --> 01:02:43.327]  You could even say 6,000, but predominantly these guilds of psychology, they didn't call it that, but how to control populations, how to manipulate populations started with witch doctors.
[01:02:44.264 --> 01:02:47.126]  They'd learn how they could go to the hills and dig out phosphorus.
[01:02:47.146 --> 01:02:47.986]  They didn't know what it was.
[01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:57.431]  Or how they could dig out sulfur and form it into a little idol and then say, ZA BOOPIE!
[01:02:57.651 --> 01:03:02.274]  And throw it into a fire and then it would explode with blue and red and green colors.
[01:03:02.734 --> 01:03:06.298]  And they could mix copper in to make it glow green, or they could say, the Green God.
[01:03:06.318 --> 01:03:09.341]  It would burn green, and they'd, how does the witch doctor do it?
[01:03:09.361 --> 01:03:10.863]  You're talking 10,000 years ago.
[01:03:12.064 --> 01:03:14.747]  Or they could mix other chemicals in to make it burn red.
[01:03:14.767 --> 01:03:17.851]  And they would say, you know, Dragon God, Azunga!
[01:03:18.351 --> 01:03:18.852]  And boom!
[01:03:21.975 --> 01:03:30.559]  And he'd say, now, you give me the best hut, and the best women, and the best servants, and my family that, or the rain god won't come.
[01:03:30.839 --> 01:03:39.182]  And then as an act of submission, this psychopathic con artist in history, and that's what they are, would say, I demand your firstborn to be my servants.
[01:03:39.902 --> 01:03:48.246]  And as a greater act of submission, the rains will not come unless you give me a child to be sacrificed, and I will eat the flesh.
[01:03:49.528 --> 01:03:51.990]  Every culture sacrifices children, eats them.
[01:03:52.771 --> 01:03:57.575]  In anthropology, every culture gobbling children is a chief enjoyment.
[01:03:57.915 --> 01:04:00.658]  This is what humans do when their psychopaths get control, and they always do.
[01:04:00.798 --> 01:04:02.700]  Now, expanding on that...
[01:04:04.606 --> 01:04:13.316]  If you go back into history, the really dominant groups would then start demanding the chief's son or the king's son.
[01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:19.442]  And the priest class would use a drought or bad weather to really get control or an earthquake.
[01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:27.093]  And they would come to the king and say, you must give me your daughter to be thrown into the fires of Moloch.
[01:04:27.954 --> 01:04:32.316]  And they would do it as an act of mind control submission.
[01:04:32.816 --> 01:04:36.177]  Now we sacrifice at blood drawing checkpoints.
[01:04:36.598 --> 01:04:39.199]  Now we let the CPS take our children as a sacrifice.
[01:04:39.819 --> 01:04:47.385]  Now we go to the naked body scanners and humiliate it all so the control freak scum can feel powerful and control us.
[01:04:47.765 --> 01:04:48.625]  Key point, Adam.
[01:04:48.646 --> 01:04:48.986]  Stay there.
[01:04:49.006 --> 01:04:54.129]  I'll let you have a counter back to what I said when we return on the other side.
[01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:56.111]  What's at the bottom of the rabbit hole?
[01:04:57.112 --> 01:04:58.893]  Con artist Bernie Madoff.

[01:05:58.933 --> 01:06:03.176]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:03.497 --> 01:06:04.097]  Number 1.
[01:06:04.397 --> 01:06:07.560]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:08.380]  Number 2.
[01:06:08.681 --> 01:06:13.244]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:13.584 --> 01:06:14.025]  It's true.
[01:06:14.325 --> 01:06:18.888]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:19.729]  Number 3.
[01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:23.312]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:27.315]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:27.515 --> 01:06:28.056]  Number 4.
[01:06:28.296 --> 01:06:30.658]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:31.059 --> 01:06:34.442]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:34.743 --> 01:06:34.963]  Number 5.
[01:06:35.543 --> 01:06:39.468]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:39.688 --> 01:06:44.453]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:06:58.772 --> 01:07:02.714]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:07:02.954 --> 01:07:08.996]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:07:09.356 --> 01:07:16.459]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:07:16.739 --> 01:07:21.281]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:34.022]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:07:34.522 --> 01:07:40.704]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:07:41.305 --> 01:07:44.726]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:51.468]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:07:51.569 --> 01:07:52.349]  Thank you.
[01:08:03.556 --> 01:08:10.282]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[01:08:10.523 --> 01:08:14.547]  Some men you just can't reach.
[01:08:14.607 --> 01:08:19.792]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[01:08:19.852 --> 01:08:21.173]  Well, he gets it.
[01:08:21.273 --> 01:08:24.916]  I don't like him anymore.
[01:08:30.054 --> 01:08:32.096]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:32.676 --> 01:08:41.143]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:42.564 --> 01:08:43.965]  Okay, let's go back to Adam.
[01:08:44.105 --> 01:08:45.586]  Adam, if you just joined us, I'd ask you.
[01:08:46.167 --> 01:08:47.108]  Is it the Illuminati?
[01:08:47.148 --> 01:08:48.149]  Is it the Bilderberg Group?
[01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:49.510]  Is it the Trilateral Commission?
[01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:50.811]  Who runs the planet?
[01:08:51.826 --> 01:08:58.209]  And if you have to look at the physically who runs it, it's the military of Europe, the United States and England.
[01:08:58.749 --> 01:09:02.731]  But who owns it through fraud is six major private central banks.
[01:09:04.052 --> 01:09:12.676]  And then if you look at the methodology of control, the Illuminati was just a Rothschild-backed arm that wanted to overthrow the Royals.
[01:09:13.652 --> 01:09:22.438]  And before that, you'd had Henry VIII fighting and wanting power, not just over wanting to have a divorce, but having his own control against the Vatican.
[01:09:22.918 --> 01:09:27.821]  So it's always the same systems of political and societal manipulation.
[01:09:28.162 --> 01:09:35.867]  It's just different groups and different clubs that understand that science and are able to mass enough power to take over their region.
[01:09:36.367 --> 01:09:43.392]  And the ultimate goal is a planetary regime to block out any future competition and to dominate the individual.
[01:09:44.212 --> 01:09:54.997]  But really, if you go back to Greece and to Egypt and to Babylon 3,000 plus years ago, they all developed systems of social control.
[01:09:55.757 --> 01:09:59.799]  You can go to Peru and the Nazca Lines and see all the evidence of social control there.
[01:10:01.059 --> 01:10:03.840]  Public works projects, making people build big temples for you.
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:04.721]  It's slavery.
[01:10:05.241 --> 01:10:07.162]  You've got to do this or the rain god won't come.
[01:10:07.822 --> 01:10:12.645]  And so it's that priest class that had really supplanted the ancient tribal class.
[01:10:13.306 --> 01:10:19.610]  You'd be the tribal leader if you were the toughest, the strongest, the smartest, had the best sixth sense, could lead your tribe to the best hunting grounds.
[01:10:20.251 --> 01:10:25.294]  If you go back to the earliest societies worldwide, you see them being supplanted by the
[01:10:26.295 --> 01:10:52.055]  Scientific class, which is really the witch doctor class, who mixed religion with mumbo-jumbo and science, early sciences, and impressing people with understanding, you know, that there will be an eclipse on this date, and saying, the snake god is going to eat the moon, or eat the sun today, and if you don't give me 1,000 sacrifices, the snake god won't regurgitate the sun back, and so everybody starts screaming and crying during the eclipse, they're chopping hearts out in Mexico City.
[01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:57.359]  And basically everywhere else where they're having eclipses, as fast as they can, going, is this going to make it come back?
[01:10:57.399 --> 01:10:59.701]  Is this going to make the snake god not kill us?
[01:10:59.741 --> 01:11:01.642]  And they're just like, give me more, give me more.
[01:11:02.123 --> 01:11:05.585]  And the main way the priest in Mesoamerica made money was in the meat markets.
[01:11:05.785 --> 01:11:10.488]  They owned the meat from the dead women and children and others.
[01:11:10.829 --> 01:11:14.811]  And then they made the profit from the main meat source being humans.
[01:11:15.232 --> 01:11:16.232]  So that's just government.
[01:11:16.453 --> 01:11:20.936]  Government normally ends up being a bunch of psychopaths on power trips eating people.
[01:11:22.511 --> 01:11:25.534]  The worst expression of humanity always takes control.
[01:11:25.854 --> 01:11:31.580]  In a more modern sense, Hitler would just launch more wars and would just love the images of burning cities.
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:33.462]  Psychopaths enjoy it.
[01:11:34.062 --> 01:11:39.188]  They enjoy controlling the arts and literature and culture and being able to dominate and control everyone.
[01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:45.414]  But, Adam, if you look at the Trilateral Commission, CFR, World Institute of International Affairs, Club of Rome, Bilderberg Group,
[01:11:47.059 --> 01:11:55.464]  They politically, it's less than 200 people that chair and run all of those organizations and they all put out the same white papers in the same direction.
[01:11:55.584 --> 01:12:04.729]  Eugenics, world government, total control, their crimes legalized, regular activity criminalized, they use the law to suppress their enemies, to create monopolies.
[01:12:05.709 --> 01:12:29.178]  But then when you look at what they do in their off time at Bohemian Grove in California, or at Groves in Germany, or you look at Francois Mitterand publicly worshipping Lucifer in mainstream news, or Tony Blair doing it in mainstream news, and being at seances and rituals, and they're a bunch of lunatics, and at the bottom of the rabbit hole, they believe they're worshipping Lucifer.
[01:12:30.099 --> 01:12:31.559]  So they're not a very nice group of people.
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:35.021]  But I hope that answers your question, Adam, because it's a very important question.
[01:12:35.737 --> 01:12:39.803]  Yeah, no, you've been very helpful, and I agree with everything that you said.
[01:12:39.843 --> 01:12:42.647]  You hit a really key point, though, that it's Lucifer.
[01:12:43.208 --> 01:12:46.473]  The rabbit hole, of course, is the journey to search for the truth.
[01:12:47.023 --> 01:12:55.909]  And once you get down to the bottom of that rabbit hole, you realize that all these people are Luciferian worshipping Satanists.
[01:12:56.049 --> 01:12:57.910]  And that's a hundred percent fact, Adam.
[01:12:58.270 --> 01:13:13.700]  Even if an atheist or agnostic doesn't believe that there's a guy in red pajamas, the point is the elite believe they worship a earth creature, a sky god, that needs blood and death and destruction, and they think it's wonderful to kill people.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.841]  You know, they think things like, you know,
[01:13:16.081 --> 01:13:17.822]  Let's pull up some of Geiger's artwork.
[01:13:18.763 --> 01:13:22.226]  Just type in Geiger alien because that's what he's most famous for.
[01:13:22.806 --> 01:13:36.116]  And the elites, I mean I've studied Schwarzenegger and he owns a bunch of this artwork and even more sickening German artwork where it's dead babies in Nazi uniforms and maggots on dead children and they just and they think it's beautiful.
[01:13:36.776 --> 01:13:41.999]  And, you know, I look at it and it's upsetting and disquieting, but for them it's, oh, how beautiful!
[01:13:42.299 --> 01:13:43.700]  And a lot of it's homoerotic.
[01:13:44.141 --> 01:13:58.129]  In fact, watch what you show, because that's not homoerotic, but it's got a lot of demons raping women and children, and death, and giant piles of mutated, and bioengineering merging with technology, and it's just...
[01:14:01.071 --> 01:14:05.496]  They'll always tell you there is no God, there is no religion, because they want you blind to that.
[01:14:05.596 --> 01:14:07.979]  Meanwhile, they're just reveling in evil.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.020]  Anything else, Adam?
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:14.501]  Yeah, no, that about sums it up.
[01:14:14.641 --> 01:14:32.405]  And again, you know, it's kind of funny because these elitists that think that they're going to get, like, eternal life or whatever, or whatever that they're falsely promised by this master of deception, you know, they're not going to get the last laugh because, you know what, they're expendable just like everybody else in history that tried to do Satan's work.
[01:14:32.705 --> 01:14:33.605]  Well said, Adam.
[01:14:34.205 --> 01:14:35.765]  Austin in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:14:38.894 --> 01:14:40.134]  Hey, I got two points, Alex.
[01:14:40.514 --> 01:14:41.915]  Um, let's see.
[01:14:42.115 --> 01:14:52.117]  I just want to start out kind of saying, um, I guess I'm kind of one of the rare ones who's actually been blessed with, uh, knowledge, you know, of living on a farm and kind of being like self-sufficient.
[01:14:52.137 --> 01:14:53.118]  You're an Al Qaeda member.
[01:14:54.918 --> 01:14:57.459]  No, no, just an American kid.
[01:14:57.559 --> 01:14:58.559]  Everything's pointed at you.
[01:14:58.659 --> 01:15:01.160]  You are what, when they say Al Qaeda, they're talking about you.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.160]  So you're Al Qaeda.
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:02.460]  Go ahead.
[01:15:04.144 --> 01:15:07.806]  Well, also, and I got really, um, I've been wanting to call and tell you about this for a while.
[01:15:07.986 --> 01:15:08.827]  It's really interesting.
[01:15:08.847 --> 01:15:09.728]  It's about George Bush.
[01:15:10.088 --> 01:15:14.891]  And, uh, I know back in the nineties, he owned the Texas Rangers baseball team.
[01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:15.251]  Yes.
[01:15:15.391 --> 01:15:19.374]  Well, they, uh, do spring training down here close to my town.
[01:15:19.514 --> 01:15:21.195]  Um, basically in Sarasota.
[01:15:21.375 --> 01:15:24.017]  And, uh, I just thought, put some connections together.
[01:15:24.037 --> 01:15:28.119]  I thought it was really interesting how Jeb Bush was the governor of Florida.
[01:15:28.639 --> 01:15:31.661]  Uh, Bush was in Sarasota when 9 11 happened.
[01:15:32.362 --> 01:15:32.482]  Um,
[01:15:33.351 --> 01:15:40.995]  You know, and then the whole drug thing, you know, our county at one point was one of the bigger drug counties in the 90s, I guess.
[01:15:41.735 --> 01:15:48.699]  But, yeah, I just kind of put all that together and kind of figured, you know, maybe what the connection might be with Florida down here.
[01:15:49.539 --> 01:15:50.960]  Well, you know what the connection is.
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:56.583]  Massive narcotics trafficking, whore running, just mafia territories.
[01:15:56.623 --> 01:16:02.766]  That's why the government's promoting legalization of prostitution and gambling everywhere, because they want to tax it and get their cut.
[01:16:03.752 --> 01:16:14.640]  Yeah, well I also thought it was really interesting because in 2004 we went through a category 4 hurricane and I basically kind of got a glimpse of what it's like to live in, you know, a martial law scenario.
[01:16:14.721 --> 01:16:17.623]  I mean, bags of ice were like 8 or 10 bucks.
[01:16:18.023 --> 01:16:24.408]  You know, nobody was prepared or had any food stored so everybody's fridge was off and everybody kind of didn't know what to do.
[01:16:24.428 --> 01:16:25.369]  Everybody was like, what do we do?
[01:16:25.911 --> 01:16:30.995]  So National Guard came, you know, and within two or three days, Bush came to our town.
[01:16:31.055 --> 01:16:34.677]  And I was like, I thought it was funny because he didn't go to Katrina for like a long time.
[01:16:35.638 --> 01:16:38.981]  And I was like, well, that's kind of odd.
[01:16:39.501 --> 01:16:41.122]  Austin, I appreciate your call.
[01:16:41.142 --> 01:16:42.003]  Good to have you on board.
[01:16:42.023 --> 01:16:44.144]  Ruth in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[01:16:44.184 --> 01:16:44.765]  Go ahead, Ruth.
[01:16:46.095 --> 01:16:46.395]  Yes.
[01:16:46.675 --> 01:16:47.496]  Hello, Alex.
[01:16:47.576 --> 01:16:47.956]  Welcome.
[01:16:48.316 --> 01:16:51.978]  I always have you in my prayers and your family.
[01:16:52.238 --> 01:16:52.999]  I need that.
[01:16:53.379 --> 01:16:54.199]  I need that shield.
[01:16:54.559 --> 01:16:55.480]  Please keep it up, Ruth.
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:57.361]  Definitely, for sure.
[01:16:57.781 --> 01:17:03.404]  Look, I want to bring out an alternative to baby formula, which is goat's milk.
[01:17:03.544 --> 01:17:04.685]  Why would you want an alternative?
[01:17:04.725 --> 01:17:07.386]  It's making the girls go into puberty at three and four years of age.
[01:17:08.106 --> 01:17:12.008]  It's causing their brain to be on average 20 percentage points smaller.
[01:17:12.028 --> 01:17:12.749]  I mean, that's loving.
[01:17:13.706 --> 01:17:19.028]  Well, case in point on all of this, my mother was an anesthetist, okay?
[01:17:19.769 --> 01:17:23.410]  And when I had my first son, I could not produce enough breast milk.
[01:17:23.971 --> 01:17:26.192]  So I tried all the formulas on the shelf.
[01:17:26.792 --> 01:17:27.892]  He threw it all up.
[01:17:27.972 --> 01:17:29.473]  He couldn't keep none of it down.
[01:17:30.033 --> 01:17:34.936]  My mother was down and she says, look, we need to find some goat's milk.
[01:17:35.396 --> 01:17:40.298]  She says, because in the old days when she was raised on a farm, that's what they used.
[01:17:41.113 --> 01:17:45.236]  And, of course, the molecular structure of goat milk is much smaller.
[01:17:45.276 --> 01:17:47.038]  It's easier to digest.
[01:17:47.698 --> 01:17:54.343]  So, at first, the doctor wanted to do a bunch of tests, so I said, okay, I'm going to try this first.
[01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:56.905]  It took me a while to try to find some.
[01:17:56.965 --> 01:18:02.549]  I wasn't able to find the fresh goat's milk, which is better, but I was able to find some canned goat's milk.
[01:18:03.089 --> 01:18:04.510]  So, I tried it.
[01:18:05.351 --> 01:18:07.613]  My son didn't throw any of it up.
[01:18:08.213 --> 01:18:09.254]  He loved it.
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:26.291]  Of course, she was from, my pediatrician was from India, so she... Well, no, I mean, throughout history, a lot of women, you know, a small percentage, but overall, a lot of women can't produce milk or have problems, or sometimes their babies are allergic to it, very rarely, and goat's milk is good.
[01:18:26.851 --> 01:18:35.677]  There's almost no rejection known for ass milk, donkey milk, from the female donkey, and so that's some of the best milk you can get for humans.
[01:18:36.958 --> 01:18:39.000]  If you can't get the, you know, regular human milk,
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.820]  But it's a conspiracy theory that women should breastfeed.
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:52.582]  I mean, everybody knows that that was a conspiracy theory, and that the family never existed, and that children need melamine-filled bisphenol A milk.
[01:18:52.622 --> 01:18:53.323]  Here's a headline.
[01:18:53.383 --> 01:18:57.103]  Tainted Chinese baby milk powder causes baby girls to grow breasts.
[01:18:57.123 --> 01:19:03.564]  Health authorities in China have ordered an investigation into a batch of powdered baby milk that caused children as young as four months to grow breasts.
[01:19:03.904 --> 01:19:06.805]  And they just admit now that that's happening here, but they say that's fine.
[01:19:10.339 --> 01:19:17.362]  And back in the day, you know, the formula was probably a little bit better than it is today.
[01:19:17.402 --> 01:19:18.963]  That was back in the Al-Qaeda.
[01:19:19.003 --> 01:19:20.764]  That was back when Americans were Al-Qaeda.
[01:19:21.324 --> 01:19:21.984]  Now they know.
[01:19:22.004 --> 01:19:23.205]  It's good to give them formula.
[01:19:23.245 --> 01:19:24.185]  Do not breastfeed.
[01:19:24.225 --> 01:19:24.846]  That is evil.
[01:19:26.747 --> 01:19:27.007]  Yeah.
[01:19:27.507 --> 01:19:28.908]  I mean, it's a shame.
[01:19:29.588 --> 01:19:31.189]  Of course, of course, I'm being sarcastic.
[01:19:31.629 --> 01:19:32.730]  Ruth, God bless you, Ruth.
[01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:33.630]  And I need those prayers.
[01:19:33.670 --> 01:19:34.090]  Thank you.
[01:19:34.971 --> 01:19:35.511]  Yeah.
[01:19:35.611 --> 01:19:37.132]  Women, look.
[01:19:38.297 --> 01:19:40.918]  If you're gonna have children, it's the most precious thing in the world.
[01:19:40.978 --> 01:19:43.240]  Have your husband work a couple extra jobs if you have to.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:45.181]  Give him at least six months of breast milk.
[01:19:45.601 --> 01:19:45.921]  Come on.
[01:19:46.762 --> 01:19:51.884]  I know it's a conspiracy theory to say your baby needs it, but you've got those mammary glands for a reason.
[01:19:52.405 --> 01:19:52.745]  Okay?
[01:19:52.785 --> 01:19:55.306]  And your baby's gonna take to that milk like a fish to water.
[01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:57.567]  Or you can give him bisphenol A laced milk.
[01:19:57.667 --> 01:19:57.867]  No?
[01:19:58.008 --> 01:19:58.348]  Formula.
[01:19:58.368 --> 01:19:58.508]  Okay.

[01:21:59.337 --> 01:22:00.938]  Jim Newcomer from Ritus Resources.
[01:22:01.278 --> 01:22:01.559]  August 11th, 2010.

[01:22:18.436 --> 01:22:22.218]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm, warning of Greek-style U.S.
[01:22:22.278 --> 01:22:23.078]  debt crises.
[01:22:23.438 --> 01:22:25.539]  CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S.
[01:22:25.599 --> 01:22:27.700]  economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:33.062]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.

[01:22:34.383 --> 01:22:40.125]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[01:22:40.325 --> 01:22:46.170]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population, and rising interest rates spells economic disaster.

[01:22:50.053 --> 01:22:53.716]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[01:22:53.937 --> 01:22:54.137]  Listen.
[01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:09.032]  My name is Ellis, and I'm 66 years old, and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[01:23:09.312 --> 01:23:12.336]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[01:23:12.717 --> 01:23:15.541]  I had 70% blockage in one artery, leading to my heart.
[01:23:15.761 --> 01:23:19.146]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused, knowing the negative side effects.
[01:23:19.522 --> 01:23:27.746]  Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[01:23:27.946 --> 01:23:30.347]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference.
[01:23:30.507 --> 01:23:34.869]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced, and within two months, I felt completely normal.

[01:23:49.881 --> 01:23:51.682]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[01:23:51.702 --> 01:23:52.563]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[01:23:52.723 --> 01:23:53.544]  It's a depression.
[01:24:05.143 --> 01:24:08.087]  Everybody's out of work, or scared of losing their job.
[01:24:09.448 --> 01:24:10.970]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[01:24:11.451 --> 01:24:14.454]  Banks are going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[01:24:15.115 --> 01:24:19.280]  Punks are running wild in the street and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it!
[01:24:20.928 --> 01:24:21.288]  We know.
[01:24:21.768 --> 01:24:23.349]  The air is unfit to breathe.
[01:24:23.449 --> 01:24:24.870]  Our food is unfit to eat.
[01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:34.153]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be!
[01:24:34.413 --> 01:24:36.474]  We know things are bad, worse than bad!
[01:24:37.094 --> 01:24:37.814]  They're crazy.
[01:24:38.034 --> 01:24:41.036]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[01:24:41.436 --> 01:24:48.338]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[01:24:48.398 --> 01:24:52.740]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios and I won't say anything.
[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:53.761]  Just leave us alone.
[01:24:54.021 --> 01:24:55.401]  Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone.
[01:24:56.261 --> 01:24:57.362]  I want you to get mad!
[01:24:58.547 --> 01:24:59.507]  I don't want you to protest.
[01:24:59.668 --> 01:25:00.628]  I don't want you to riot.
[01:25:00.648 --> 01:25:03.609]  I don't want you to write to your congressmen because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[01:25:03.970 --> 01:25:08.271]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
[01:25:08.612 --> 01:25:11.153]  All I know is that first, you've got to get mad!
[01:25:11.593 --> 01:25:13.474]  You've got to say, I'm a human being!
[01:25:13.714 --> 01:25:14.915]  My life has value!
[01:25:16.535 --> 01:25:18.676]  I want you to get up now.
[01:25:20.017 --> 01:25:21.998]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[01:25:23.288 --> 01:25:33.454]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'm as tired as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore!
[01:25:33.474 --> 01:25:36.395]  I want you to get up right now.
[01:25:37.116 --> 01:25:47.481]  Get up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell, I'm as tired as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore!
[01:25:47.741 --> 01:25:48.682]  We are back live.
[01:25:50.689 --> 01:25:51.750]  Alan Watt is coming up.
[01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:56.933]  We'll take your Twitter questions at Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[01:26:00.095 --> 01:26:02.836]  Again, that's Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[01:26:02.876 --> 01:26:06.699]  We'll take some of your Twitter questions and the phones will be open while he's on with us.
[01:26:06.719 --> 01:26:09.520]  I've got a host of issues and news items I want to go over.
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:14.623]  He was on with us last week, but an hour wasn't enough, so he'll be joining us for much of the last hour and a half.
[01:26:15.384 --> 01:26:18.265]  Let's go ahead and go to Daniel in Virginia.
[01:26:18.305 --> 01:26:18.966]  You're on the air.
[01:26:20.776 --> 01:26:22.016]  Okay, what's going on, Alex?
[01:26:22.257 --> 01:26:26.978]  Worldwide transmission against tyranny in a last-ditch effort to reignite the fires of liberty.
[01:26:28.459 --> 01:26:29.399]  There you go, buddy.
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:40.264]  I just want to call and let you know that you have awakened a lot of people, and you have done a tremendous job doing that.
[01:26:40.804 --> 01:26:46.586]  Not only I want, you should deserve credit, but the people who are listening to you deserve credit.
[01:26:46.666 --> 01:26:48.307]  Yes.
[01:26:48.467 --> 01:26:50.428]  And the people, because the people
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:55.362]  People need to rejuvenate as far as what is going on.
[01:26:55.382 --> 01:26:55.502]  Right.
[01:26:55.522 --> 01:26:57.163]  Well, I used to be a security guard at a security company.
[01:26:57.183 --> 01:27:00.745]  I had to give it up because of the things that were going on in that security company.
[01:27:00.765 --> 01:27:00.965]  My heart
[01:27:20.089 --> 01:27:24.492]  It's not in to what they were doing, but I'll just let you know, Alex, and I'll let the people know.
[01:27:25.692 --> 01:27:38.800]  We can agree or disagree, but your heart's in the right place, and the people who are listening to you, or the people who are trying to get a comprehension of what you're all about, their heart's in the right place as well.
[01:27:39.841 --> 01:27:44.704]  And then it takes all of us as a whole, not as a few, to make a difference.
[01:27:46.041 --> 01:27:46.501]  That's right.
[01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:49.023]  And the enemy wants to demoralize us.
[01:27:49.043 --> 01:27:51.365]  They want us to not think that we have power.
[01:27:51.425 --> 01:27:53.766]  They want us to get us in fighting with each other.
[01:27:53.966 --> 01:27:54.226]  No.
[01:27:54.827 --> 01:27:55.868]  It's Goldman Sachs.
[01:27:56.428 --> 01:27:59.230]  It's the major banks.
[01:27:59.370 --> 01:28:01.151]  It's JP Morgan, Bank of America.
[01:28:01.211 --> 01:28:02.072]  It's the globalists.
[01:28:02.472 --> 01:28:07.395]  It's the people openly trampling our laws, setting up world government, destroying our borders.
[01:28:07.675 --> 01:28:10.938]  We have to identify the enemy and say, get out of our country.
[01:28:10.978 --> 01:28:11.338]  Go ahead.
[01:28:12.058 --> 01:28:12.559]  There you go.
[01:28:13.319 --> 01:28:15.801]  And as long as they keep persecuting you, Alex,
[01:28:16.542 --> 01:28:27.232]  As long as they continue the persecution of you and everybody else, the more it's going to grow and the more powerful we're going to become, and the more exposed you're going to become.
[01:28:27.572 --> 01:28:35.058]  Because the more they keep exposing you in a negative way, people are going to stop and think and say, well, gee, why are they going after this man so much?
[01:28:36.199 --> 01:28:39.382]  Gee, why are they talking about this man so much?
[01:28:39.442 --> 01:28:41.804]  Why are they criticizing this man so much?
[01:28:42.425 --> 01:28:43.326]  Because you
[01:28:44.627 --> 01:28:46.408]  Expose them as who they are.
[01:28:46.648 --> 01:28:47.509]  But it's not hard.
[01:28:47.829 --> 01:28:49.069]  I mean, it's in the mainstream news.
[01:28:49.089 --> 01:28:55.112]  They're going to put cameras watching us, hooked into CPS for everybody and everybody who has children.
[01:28:55.152 --> 01:28:57.954]  They admit the naked body scanners are being saved, the images.
[01:28:58.454 --> 01:29:00.155]  They admit they're doing all these crimes.
[01:29:00.975 --> 01:29:02.636]  Look at what I've done in the last hour and a half.
[01:29:02.716 --> 01:29:04.077]  I've just covered common sense.
[01:29:04.777 --> 01:29:05.518]  It's not hard.
[01:29:05.958 --> 01:29:07.759]  I've just gone over what's really happening.
[01:29:08.439 --> 01:29:09.960]  I mean, it's simple.
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:18.646]  So what is it that the establishment media and the government and their controlled COINTELPRO hordes, what is it they're so upset about on this broadcast?
[01:29:18.666 --> 01:29:28.633]  They're upset because we're having an effect and we have a giant audience that's growing exponentially and they know that we're getting people to awaken and to take action.
[01:29:28.653 --> 01:29:37.779]  I don't have all the answers, but I know that getting people to awaken and to say no to tyranny, wherever you find it, wherever you see it, whether it's local or national or in your own family,
[01:29:38.619 --> 01:29:44.061]  And loving each other and loving goodness and bringing that light into the world will defeat these people.
[01:29:44.441 --> 01:29:45.362]  God bless you, Daniel.
[01:29:45.562 --> 01:29:47.302]  More calls and Alan Watts straight ahead.
[01:29:49.763 --> 01:29:50.664]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.164 --> 01:29:52.764]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.685 --> 01:29:56.366]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:01.788 --> 01:31:05.309]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.

[01:31:08.471 --> 01:31:13.473]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:03.583]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:32:03.683 --> 01:32:04.464]  What have we got?
[01:32:04.684 --> 01:32:06.805]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:32:07.126 --> 01:32:07.846]  A republic.
[01:32:08.146 --> 01:32:10.708]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:32:10.788 --> 01:32:12.709]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:32:13.049 --> 01:32:14.951]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:32:15.071 --> 01:32:16.352]  So they think they own our land?
[01:32:16.752 --> 01:32:17.873]  They think they own our water?
[01:32:18.073 --> 01:32:18.473]  Children?
[01:32:18.673 --> 01:32:19.474]  Our education?
[01:32:19.794 --> 01:32:20.414]  Our money?
[01:32:20.634 --> 01:32:24.277]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:32:24.637 --> 01:32:28.282]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:32:29.624 --> 01:32:30.445]  We have the facts.
[01:32:30.645 --> 01:32:31.746]  We have the Constitution.
[01:32:31.806 --> 01:32:32.688]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:32:32.708 --> 01:32:33.549]  We have common law.
[01:32:33.589 --> 01:32:35.852]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:36.132 --> 01:32:39.897]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:32:39.997 --> 01:32:44.779]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:46.319]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:32:46.439 --> 01:32:47.280]  Don't tread on me.
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:54.402]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:32:59.581]  We've got it.
[01:32:59.821 --> 01:33:05.826]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:33:05.927 --> 01:33:10.010]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:10.311 --> 01:33:15.976]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:17.898 --> 01:33:19.119]  We are gold!
[01:33:20.901 --> 01:33:25.407]  You can see the Earth from here.
[01:33:25.447 --> 01:33:26.929]  You are go!
[01:33:26.989 --> 01:33:33.698]  We know what's going on.
[01:33:33.718 --> 01:33:34.119]  We've got it.
[01:33:39.325 --> 01:33:43.248]  We are rallying patriots worldwide to awaken others.
[01:33:43.308 --> 01:33:48.311]  We're going to Alan Watt for the balance of this hour and the next at Open Phones.
[01:33:48.331 --> 01:33:53.675]  I had him on for an hour last week and he just has so much knowledge and I like to bounce ideas off of him.
[01:33:53.695 --> 01:33:54.336]  He's here with us.
[01:33:54.916 --> 01:33:56.838]  CutIntoTheMatrix.com is his website.
[01:33:56.858 --> 01:33:57.818]  A lot of breaking news.
[01:33:57.838 --> 01:33:58.459]  We're going to cover a
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:05.505]  Huge range of vital issues on the economy, the war, the nature of the New World Order, their history.
[01:34:05.885 --> 01:34:08.227]  A caller earlier said, where did the New World Order get founded?
[01:34:08.327 --> 01:34:09.148]  Where do they come from?
[01:34:09.528 --> 01:34:10.629]  What's their mindset?
[01:34:11.330 --> 01:34:12.250]  What's their beginnings?
[01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:14.732]  And I talked about the priest class in Egypt.
[01:34:15.573 --> 01:34:24.081]  And in Babylon and a little lesser extent Greece, developing systems of social control in those universities and systems of manipulation.
[01:34:24.101 --> 01:34:29.645]  But we'll get his breakdown of it and who's at the core of the power structure here in just a moment.
[01:34:30.426 --> 01:34:30.926]  But first...
[01:34:31.766 --> 01:34:34.108]  You know, I sell books, videos, t-shirts, materials.
[01:34:34.148 --> 01:34:39.271]  Not just the 25 films I've made or produced, but other great films that I see and I think are informative.
[01:34:39.331 --> 01:34:41.012]  We endeavor to get them and then discount them to you.
[01:34:41.272 --> 01:34:43.994]  We've got specials that are lower than anything we've ever offered.
[01:34:44.295 --> 01:34:46.516]  A whole bunch of our best-selling videos.
[01:34:46.976 --> 01:34:48.437]  We're not discounting old stuff.
[01:34:48.517 --> 01:34:49.378]  That's discounted too.
[01:34:50.098 --> 01:34:51.039]  And what is old is new.
[01:34:51.059 --> 01:34:51.900]  A lot of it's excellent.
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:53.221]  All of it's excellent.
[01:34:54.441 --> 01:34:56.143]  But I mean excellent even compared to the new stuff.
[01:34:57.099 --> 01:35:02.025]  It's evergreen because the info is so accurate, and because we're going off the globalist-owned documents and admissions.
[01:35:02.065 --> 01:35:15.722]  But you can get Invisible Empire, buy one, get three free to give to friends and family, follow the Republic, police state for the rise of FEMA, got big deals on the Secret of Oz discounted, exposing the whole banking cartel and key solutions, the Obama deception.
[01:35:16.403 --> 01:35:20.625]  We've got deals on free ball caps and t-shirts all available at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:20.966 --> 01:35:24.708]  Two different shopping carts up there on the site.
[01:35:24.748 --> 01:35:26.749]  You can choose from the Yahoo cart and our own cart.
[01:35:27.069 --> 01:35:29.010]  We can also call toll-free 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or PO Box 19549.
[01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:30.691]  That's PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:35:30.731 --> 01:35:32.872]  And when you purchase books and materials, you get things that are
[01:35:48.218 --> 01:35:55.422]  Crafted to really give people the most information in the shortest period of time in a professional presentation that will wake them up.
[01:35:55.722 --> 01:35:58.564]  And your purchase supports what we're doing here.
[01:35:58.604 --> 01:35:59.664]  This is symbiotic.
[01:36:00.164 --> 01:36:06.648]  And the globalists hate this radio show and have pulled out all the stops unsuccessfully to stop us because they're afraid of you.
[01:36:07.168 --> 01:36:12.391]  And they're afraid of the defense of freedom that we are having here.
[01:36:13.351 --> 01:36:14.992]  And so I commend all of you for your support.
[01:36:15.012 --> 01:36:16.713]  You can also support us and see the live
[01:36:18.052 --> 01:36:24.835]  TV version of the radio show, simulcast all three hours every day, and then archived at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:36:25.195 --> 01:36:39.640]  All my films, a bunch of other films have been authorized to post, like Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic at PrisonPlanet.TV, Camp FEMA, special expanded extras from the films that are only at PrisonPlanet.TV, six and a half years up and running.
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.901]  PrisonPlanet.TV, 15 cents a day.
[01:36:42.341 --> 01:36:46.283]  And by the way, it takes about a minute to sign up with your username passcode,
[01:36:46.843 --> 01:36:50.786]  Then six computers can be logged in with the same passcode at one time.
[01:36:50.806 --> 01:36:52.708]  So you can share it with your friends and family.
[01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.969]  Okay?
[01:36:54.269 --> 01:36:55.130]  And that's all we can afford.
[01:36:55.150 --> 01:36:57.011]  If I could afford it, I'd say you could share it with a hundred people.
[01:36:57.052 --> 01:37:01.535]  But PrisonPlanet.TV, I want to thank you all for your continued support.
[01:37:01.555 --> 01:37:02.416]  We couldn't do it without you.
[01:37:04.195 --> 01:37:12.039]  Going to Alan Watt of CuttingToTheMatrix.com, a long-term researcher, author, researcher, somebody who I found is really spot-on with his analysis.
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:24.266]  There are few people out there, because I've read hundreds of history books, hundreds of globalist handbooks, hundreds and hundreds of white papers, and so many times he'll start saying something, and I've read the document years ago and even forgotten about it.
[01:37:24.706 --> 01:37:29.128]  He's somebody who, I can tell you, is just right on target, and teaches me a lot.
[01:37:29.168 --> 01:37:33.191]  You know, we all teach each other, but I always really, really
[01:37:33.851 --> 01:37:40.539]  I don't want to say enjoy because it's horrifying having Alan on to really help folks get a higher level of understanding and take the blinders off.
[01:37:40.819 --> 01:37:42.982]  So we're going to talk about a host of issues today.
[01:37:43.002 --> 01:37:44.223]  Alan, good to have you here with us.
[01:37:45.084 --> 01:37:46.506]  It's a pleasure to be back on, Alex.
[01:37:47.498 --> 01:37:52.940]  Alan, a caller called at the start of the hour, and he said, I want you to ask Alan Watt the power structure.
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:56.401]  We hear about Bilderberg, Trilateral Commission, CFR, Illuminati.
[01:37:57.522 --> 01:37:58.382]  Is it the banks?
[01:37:58.462 --> 01:37:59.782]  Is it the military industrial complex?
[01:37:59.822 --> 01:38:09.586]  And I just pointed out, there's less than 200 people that chair and head up the Fortune 100, and they all cross-chair, sometimes on hundreds of boards, all these other organizations.
[01:38:10.046 --> 01:38:12.687]  They all push for the same thing, global governance, tyranny.
[01:38:13.507 --> 01:38:28.351]  But I thought we'd get you to talk about that structure, that architecture from your perspective, but also the different cultures and ideas that fed into it, and of course I call it the priest class, because that's what they call it themselves, and what the Illuminati is.
[01:38:28.731 --> 01:38:29.711]  You've got the floor.
[01:38:30.171 --> 01:38:32.352]  I'm going to try not to interrupt, even though it's always thought-provoking.
[01:38:32.712 --> 01:38:40.414]  Spend five minutes or so breaking down its history, who they are, their modes of control, and where they're taking us if we don't block them.
[01:38:42.165 --> 01:39:10.591]  Well, basically, it's a system, and that's what it is, it's a system and a philosophy, which is also a religion with its own belief system, that really has been around since commerce began, organized commerce, and organized commerce, we don't even know how old it is, we have the ancient traders, they've even dug up Sumer, for instance, and found out there's another group, pre-existing Sumer, who were into trading,
[01:39:11.566 --> 01:39:16.250]  They lived very well, we know that from their indoor plumbing and stuff like that, thousands of years ago.
[01:39:17.231 --> 01:39:20.754]  And they had the trade routes all the way to China, right through the Middle East and Asia.
[01:39:21.635 --> 01:39:26.519]  So, trading is the key to it, because along with trading comes something called money.
[01:39:28.021 --> 01:39:36.148]  And it's different from barter, where two people can literally argue over the price of a sack of potatoes versus a sack of oatmeal.
[01:39:36.935 --> 01:39:37.355]  I don't
[01:39:59.733 --> 01:40:00.193]  I don't know.
[01:40:20.652 --> 01:40:31.539]  And so eventually, over time, they got people to accept money, and they did it by giving them loans to countries, generally to the kings or the head chief or whoever of a particular area or island.
[01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:35.722]  And from then on, basically, they started the debt system.
[01:40:37.003 --> 01:40:38.944]  And as we all know, we're still in the same system today.
[01:40:39.004 --> 01:40:39.865]  It's never failed.
[01:40:40.365 --> 01:40:42.226]  Eventually, the king gets rather spoiled.
[01:40:42.286 --> 01:40:44.568]  He wants all the goodies that he's shown from these traders.
[01:40:45.108 --> 01:40:47.510]  As they come into port every so often, he borrows more.
[01:40:48.135 --> 01:40:54.078]  And eventually it comes time to pay him back, and he's rather shocked to find out how much it's going to cost.
[01:40:54.678 --> 01:40:57.380]  So the Phoenicians did deals with them.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:58.240]  We know this for a fact.
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:05.163]  The Phoenicians used to get the kings to assemble men for armies, pay them with the same thing called money.
[01:41:05.183 --> 01:41:06.664]  That's a key to armies as well.
[01:41:06.684 --> 01:41:11.547]  An army is no use, an organized army, if you can't pay them with something.
[01:41:11.567 --> 01:41:14.308]  They tend to go home, they get bored and get fed up.
[01:41:15.111 --> 01:41:25.319]  So, they used that, and they lent the king money for paying the soldiers too, and then they go off and invade a country that would not accept the trade, that would not accept the money, and so on.
[01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:35.346]  And we find this all the way down through into even the Spartan Wars, where the Spartans for a hundred years fought off this outside trade system with its money system.
[01:41:35.786 --> 01:41:43.292]  And the Phoenicians not only traded with money, it was mainly silver at that time, they had standardized the size of the coinage everywhere.
[01:41:43.312 --> 01:41:44.653]  It doesn't matter whose head was on it,
[01:41:45.402 --> 01:41:47.363]  For different countries, as long as it weighed the same.
[01:41:47.423 --> 01:41:51.266]  So they were standardizing the money system just like the IMF is today.
[01:41:51.506 --> 01:41:52.066]  Same idea.
[01:41:53.447 --> 01:41:55.348]  And so they conquered down through the ages.
[01:41:56.529 --> 01:42:02.693]  And then they formed, we find this around the Middle Ages, massive leagues, they called them.
[01:42:03.193 --> 01:42:11.458]  There were leagues, the Hanseatic leagues and various other leagues of trading countries and like a big corporation, you might say.
[01:42:12.162 --> 01:42:15.824]  And they were based at that time in Venice and in Holland.
[01:42:17.025 --> 01:42:20.327]  Holland came out of nowhere because the money men came in.
[01:42:20.387 --> 01:42:22.388]  That's how empires arise.
[01:42:22.408 --> 01:42:24.709]  They don't arise because someone's a great conqueror.
[01:42:25.049 --> 01:42:33.434]  They actually arise because those with the money move into that country with the money and the know-how and they rise it up.
[01:42:33.755 --> 01:42:37.937]  They move down through time and skip to different countries when it suits them.
[01:42:38.766 --> 01:42:39.166]  We're good to go.
[01:42:53.636 --> 01:42:56.499]  And money is the key to controlling everything.
[01:42:56.980 --> 01:43:00.603]  That's what Rothschild said when he took over the Bank of England.
[01:43:01.244 --> 01:43:05.708]  And I don't believe either, by the way, that it wasn't a setup to take over the bank.
[01:43:05.768 --> 01:43:10.854]  It was prearranged with the nobility already in Britain to allow it to happen.
[01:43:11.474 --> 01:43:16.536]  Because if Rothschild had bankrupted every nobility, he wouldn't have lasted very long on the streets of London.
[01:43:16.556 --> 01:43:17.376]  Well, that's on record.
[01:43:17.396 --> 01:43:23.638]  He made deals with the nobility even before he staged the 1815 panic.
[01:43:25.259 --> 01:43:32.721]  And you also find out, too, Alex, that, I mean, see, they brought in King George and his family over from Prussia.
[01:43:32.781 --> 01:43:37.243]  Now, Prussia is part of the pre-existing Germany, the Germanic regions.
[01:43:38.058 --> 01:43:41.243]  I was one of the first countries to give up in Germany.
[01:43:41.283 --> 01:43:48.313]  They actually put up their... When they run out of royalty, they would put up for a vote for those with the biggest... like an auction sale.
[01:43:49.429 --> 01:43:58.871]  And that present, even today's present group who took over as the Georges, belonged to the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha houses.
[01:43:58.931 --> 01:44:03.413]  These were three areas of the Germanic and Prussian regions which they owned.
[01:44:03.453 --> 01:44:04.273]  They were princedoms.
[01:44:04.793 --> 01:44:07.314]  They bought them over and they became the royalty.
[01:44:07.334 --> 01:44:12.915]  Their actual background was in trading themselves, so they belonged to the same group as the Rothschilds.
[01:44:13.135 --> 01:44:16.616]  And they also were the last country really to end slavery.
[01:44:16.636 --> 01:44:28.559]  We always hear about blacks being slaves here, but in those different Germanic regions, Austria and what is Germany today, you had the military slaves or the Hessians.
[01:44:30.119 --> 01:44:31.240]  Yes, that's what they did too.
[01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:32.320]  They drafted their men up.
[01:44:33.218 --> 01:44:34.179]  And sold them off.
[01:44:34.239 --> 01:44:42.244]  And during the American War of Revolution, they brought on a lot of Hessian troops, because George was a Hessian himself.
[01:44:42.584 --> 01:44:44.005]  That was Hessian Germany.
[01:44:44.025 --> 01:44:45.446]  He still owned that part of it.
[01:44:46.426 --> 01:44:56.573]  But you'll find, for instance, the Rothschilds and the different female lineages, especially of the Rothschilds, are all intermarried with royalty of the whole of Europe.
[01:44:57.854 --> 01:45:00.275]  And so they're really one and all the same people.
[01:45:01.096 --> 01:45:01.256]  So
[01:45:02.592 --> 01:45:03.953]  As I say, that's a big part of it.
[01:45:03.973 --> 01:45:08.017]  So you have money, you have trading, you have intermarriage of very powerful families.
[01:45:09.018 --> 01:45:21.429]  And there's nothing better than to give your daughter, for instance, to a king, because now you're allied with that king, and you take the royal titles, your offspring become the heirs down the road, and you can control things.
[01:45:21.449 --> 01:45:22.910]  That's a very old, old technique.
[01:45:22.930 --> 01:45:24.952]  And all of those major dynasties
[01:45:26.693 --> 01:45:42.269]  We're and are intermarried and now we see Goldman Sachs heads marrying in and the daughters of presidents marrying in and all of those psychopathic and abusive sadomasochistic genetic traits are then passed on and concentrated.
[01:45:43.731 --> 01:45:48.776]  You even find the astonishing things in history that really get to you
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:46:04.584]  When you find... An easy example, for instance, is 9-11, where down the road in New York, the day that it happened, George Bush's father was having a meeting with the Layden family, the Ben Layden family.
[01:46:05.143 --> 01:46:12.309]  Because they have a corporation, the Bushies and the Layton families, to build bomb-proof structures across the world.
[01:46:12.369 --> 01:46:15.912]  Yeah, that's AP and London Guardian, Bush Sr.
[01:46:15.932 --> 01:46:20.977]  meeting with head of Bin Laden's family on the morning of 9-11, at the Carlisle Group meeting.
[01:46:21.657 --> 01:46:22.058]  That's right.
[01:46:22.398 --> 01:46:26.982]  And not only that, too, when the first 9-11 bombing took place, people forget about it.
[01:46:27.768 --> 01:46:28.529]  Yeah, I think.
[01:46:47.755 --> 01:46:51.419]  With Bush basically facing Bin Laden in the comic strips, that is.
[01:46:52.119 --> 01:46:54.841]  And meanwhile, the same families have a business enterprise.
[01:46:54.902 --> 01:46:56.263]  That's almost impossible.
[01:46:56.403 --> 01:47:04.290]  And they love sick jokes to say Bin Laden did it when actually that company was in there in the buildings years before after the 93 bombing.
[01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:06.592]  In a sick way, yeah, they did bomb it.
[01:47:07.593 --> 01:47:08.654]  Yeah, I mean, it really is.
[01:47:08.674 --> 01:47:11.336]  It's a cartoon show we're given.
[01:47:11.877 --> 01:47:17.479]  Where the Bushes and the Laydens, out of millions of billions of people on the planet, just happen to be in a business enterprise.
[01:47:17.779 --> 01:47:20.841]  And the same countries end up at war and all that kind of stuff.
[01:47:20.881 --> 01:47:26.263]  And then Marvin Bush was running security on the World Trade Center complex until the morning of September 11th.
[01:47:26.583 --> 01:47:29.304]  He'd signed over authority and they'd gotten a new management firm.
[01:47:30.084 --> 01:47:30.284]  Yes.
[01:47:30.925 --> 01:47:32.725]  And then you went to FDR, for instance.
[01:47:32.905 --> 01:47:36.467]  FDR, whose wife was a rabid communist.
[01:47:36.487 --> 01:47:39.388]  She loved the Soviet system.
[01:47:40.285 --> 01:47:46.048]  She loved the techniques of mind control that Pavlov was doing.
[01:47:46.088 --> 01:48:01.797]  She went over to see Pavlov and she thought the same system should be brought to America because although the children were not very happy and laughing and joking on the way to school, they were so orderly and she was so impressed by this orderly and collective
[01:48:02.569 --> 01:48:14.018]  So, but the thing is, too, in one of her books, she put down the genealogy of FDR and herself, because she was a cousin of FDR, the Intramurray, to keep power and wealth amongst themselves.
[01:48:14.959 --> 01:48:25.927]  And you find that the Sachs family, who initially funded Hitler to power, was a relative of FDR.
[01:48:27.093 --> 01:48:27.513]  I don't know.
[01:48:45.643 --> 01:48:46.484]  Absolutely.
[01:48:46.504 --> 01:48:47.445]  Absolutely.
[01:48:47.465 --> 01:48:49.127]  And that's what change is.
[01:48:49.147 --> 01:48:50.128]  You're right on with that.
[01:48:50.148 --> 01:48:52.650]  Because this is the century of change.
[01:48:52.730 --> 01:48:55.814]  Now, these characters all know what they mean by the century of change.
[01:49:07.759 --> 01:49:15.515]  It's the culmination of their centuries-long war to take over a world, standardize the world.
[01:49:16.415 --> 01:49:19.636]  Um, basically reduce the population to a manageable level.
[01:49:19.656 --> 01:49:23.317]  They've got sciences at the top of the tree when it comes to their belief system.
[01:49:23.337 --> 01:49:27.798]  They believe that science and sciences, um, then they can control.
[01:49:27.838 --> 01:49:36.800]  Because if you can eradicate countries and then even individuals, there's no way to resist because you've got a drugged out, mindless zombie drooling, telling you about UFC fights.
[01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:38.060]  Absolutely.
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:45.582]  And from the earliest times, even when Rosicrucianism, which is a front group, basically to help the dominant group,
[01:49:46.445 --> 01:49:46.665]  I think?
[01:50:04.862 --> 01:50:07.683]  Uh, but they were into real chemistry and real, what we call, real medicine.
[01:50:07.703 --> 01:50:14.906]  Yeah, they admitted that two days ago that, oh, the Chinese 4,000 years ago were in trade with America and with Africa.
[01:50:15.166 --> 01:50:17.327]  Oh, and the nobility of Europe always knew this.
[01:50:17.567 --> 01:50:18.567]  They had all the maps.
[01:50:18.607 --> 01:50:22.349]  They were just keeping the public in the dark during that period of re-engineering.
[01:50:22.949 --> 01:50:23.489]  Absolutely.
[01:50:23.729 --> 01:50:24.149]  Absolutely.
[01:50:24.489 --> 01:50:26.450]  And they can take whole chunks of history away.
[01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:28.591]  They've done it before because we know darn well
[01:50:29.726 --> 01:50:46.870]  That there were people here in the Americas long before Columbus and the bash professors who come up with the evidence to... Well, no, they've tested the DNA of Native Americans and it's northern European in the last 15,000 years of the mitochondrial DNA because they were all here intermarried.
[01:50:46.890 --> 01:50:48.170]  They dug them up all over the country.
[01:50:48.210 --> 01:50:49.610]  The media keeps it quite quiet.
[01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:51.131]  They dig Vikings up every year.
[01:50:51.411 --> 01:50:56.252]  We'll be right back with Alan Watt, the true history of the world and what's currently happening straight ahead.
[01:50:56.312 --> 01:50:57.092]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:59.431 --> 01:51:00.691]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:00.731 --> 01:51:06.093]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:06.313 --> 01:51:10.955]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:11.335 --> 01:51:11.735]  It's true.
[01:51:11.815 --> 01:51:16.377]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:16.917 --> 01:51:21.620]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:22.141 --> 01:51:24.062]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:24.442 --> 01:51:29.065]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:29.265 --> 01:51:30.146]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:30.366 --> 01:51:33.148]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:33.448 --> 01:51:36.750]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:37.071 --> 01:51:39.912]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:40.253 --> 01:51:42.154]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:42.474 --> 01:51:43.395]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:47.037 --> 01:51:48.058]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:48.478 --> 01:51:55.785]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:56.105 --> 01:51:58.547]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:59.248 --> 01:52:01.329]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[01:52:01.770 --> 01:52:04.872]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[01:52:05.333 --> 01:52:13.300]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:18.726]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[01:52:19.287 --> 01:52:24.413]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[01:52:24.934 --> 01:52:32.403]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness and put up tons of free food, too.
[01:52:32.944 --> 01:52:37.968]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[01:52:38.408 --> 01:52:39.689]  Our foods are their enemy.

[01:52:59.266 --> 01:53:02.427]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:53:02.807 --> 01:53:04.627]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:53:05.088 --> 01:53:05.508]  Don't!
[01:53:05.968 --> 01:53:08.989]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:53:09.409 --> 01:53:16.530]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:53:16.510 --> 01:53:18.171]  's number one debt secret.
[01:53:18.491 --> 01:53:22.152]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:53:22.552 --> 01:53:25.275]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:53:25.696 --> 01:53:32.744]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:53:33.064 --> 01:53:34.065]  Herb K was right.
[01:53:34.265 --> 01:53:37.309]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:53:37.449 --> 01:53:38.330]  What do you have to lose?
[01:53:38.730 --> 01:53:39.672]  Stop the calls now.

[01:53:42.415 --> 01:53:45.198]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[01:53:45.218 --> 01:53:45.518]  Call 800-405-7850.
[01:53:45.538 --> 01:53:46.119]  That's 800-405-7850.
[01:53:46.139 --> 01:53:46.179]  800-405-7850.
[01:54:05.746 --> 01:54:09.909]  All right, Doug, Chris, Stan, and others, your calls are coming up.
[01:54:09.929 --> 01:54:11.690]  We're starting the next hour here in a few minutes.
[01:54:13.251 --> 01:54:20.156]  Alan, going back though, not just looking at trade and money and governments that could create caste systems and organization.
[01:54:21.177 --> 01:54:27.361]  We're very small members of, you know, Europe in the last 4,000 years, went to Northern India and took over.
[01:54:27.662 --> 01:54:29.543]  They've tested their mitochondrial DNA.
[01:54:30.363 --> 01:54:32.145]  They're a Central and Western European.
[01:54:34.198 --> 01:54:40.325]  Not just that, but also the priest class of manipulation and learning how to control the population.
[01:54:40.666 --> 01:54:43.910]  That's a big key to this secret knowledge that's passed on as well.
[01:54:45.491 --> 01:54:50.838]  Yes, the studying of, as I've always said, we see so many nature programs on television.
[01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:57.897]  But we don't realize that mankind has been the most studied creature on the planet for thousands of thousands of years.
[01:54:58.377 --> 01:55:01.080]  If you want to dominate the planet, you don't have to dominate the ants.
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:02.622]  You want to dominate people.
[01:55:03.282 --> 01:55:05.585]  And you have to know how people think, how they tick.
[01:55:06.085 --> 01:55:11.151]  And it's quite easy, actually, because the easiest thing is to go into so-called primitive societies.
[01:55:11.591 --> 01:55:18.657]  And see the microcosm of what really matters, because everything else comes from those primitive ideas, lifestyles, taboos, and so on.
[01:55:18.977 --> 01:55:22.379]  You simply amplify it into a more complex system.
[01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:33.048]  They're really all the same, and they understand how human beings interact with each other, and how they have certain emotions, how they're driven really by emotions.
[01:55:33.668 --> 01:55:34.669]  That's the key to it.
[01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:36.710]  That's what Bernays came out with, too.
[01:55:36.770 --> 01:55:40.954]  You can literally modify the behavior of a whole continent or a whole world,
[01:55:41.574 --> 01:55:55.266]  By pandering to these subconscious desires and emotions and get people to buy things they've never thought of before until the ads come out and make them want this thing for the first time.
[01:55:55.626 --> 01:55:56.847]  It's the same thing with us.
[01:55:56.927 --> 01:55:59.970]  We have the need to mate with people, for instance.
[01:56:00.711 --> 01:56:05.340]  And so people meet, they form tribes, small tribes.
[01:56:05.941 --> 01:56:09.488]  The tribes have their various taboos that helps them to survive.
[01:56:09.508 --> 01:56:10.590]  Everyone knows the rules.
[01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:11.351]  You don't need police.
[01:56:13.044 --> 01:56:17.207]  And they're generally very self-sufficient, completely self-sufficient in fact.
[01:56:17.507 --> 01:56:31.095]  And the globalists admit to steal your thunder that they come in and remove the taboos and tell people to be wild and crazy so society degenerates so the government can come in with its new taboos and be more oppressive.
[01:56:32.056 --> 01:56:36.979]  Yes, and of course we find from the 1800s for instance when the same organization
[01:56:39.053 --> 01:56:41.776]  The same organization that put Charles Darwin out there.
[01:56:41.816 --> 01:56:45.179]  Now, Darwin was put out there by the Royal Society.
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:56.510]  In fact, Wallace was the guy they took most of the writings about evolution from, but they also used Charles Darwin's father and grandfather's writings, because they were both writing about evolution.
[01:56:56.811 --> 01:57:01.015]  This is a belief system within a religion that was far, far older than Darwin.
[01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:10.312]  And we know the Darwins themselves practiced this religion by only intermarrying the same family, the Wedgwood family, for many generations.
[01:57:11.614 --> 01:57:18.859]  That was part of this religion, intermarriage with special types, to try and breed special genes.
[01:57:19.399 --> 01:57:33.768]  And Plato, because he actually wrote about thousands of years before that, 2,300 years before, Plato talks about if you want good scientists, good mathematicians, then you simply intermarry a male and a female who are good at mathematics.
[01:57:34.168 --> 01:57:41.390]  And then take the children, interbreed them, and so on, and so on, until you have, you're pretty well guaranteed a good mathematician.
[01:57:41.690 --> 01:57:43.970]  And it's the same with all other aspects of life.
[01:57:44.290 --> 01:57:47.431]  Well, we have that today, and we've had it for a long time.
[01:57:47.451 --> 01:57:49.672]  The Rothschilds are an example with that.
[01:57:49.712 --> 01:57:50.912]  They only marry their nieces.
[01:57:51.752 --> 01:57:56.633]  And so, and it used to astound me, I says, why would dynasties not change?
[01:57:56.693 --> 01:57:57.013]  Why not?
[01:57:57.234 --> 01:58:00.374]  Why wouldn't you get a guy come along saying, well, I don't want to be a banker, daddy.
[01:58:00.434 --> 01:58:02.455]  I'd rather be something else, an actor or something.
[01:58:02.755 --> 01:58:03.415]  It doesn't happen.
[01:58:04.235 --> 01:58:06.960]  They're pretty well guaranteed to be just like their fathers, you see.
[01:58:07.441 --> 01:58:15.537]  But they also have the addition of a reinforcement of a particular education from their family and from special higher priests.
[01:58:16.078 --> 01:58:18.199]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.187]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:58:48.715 --> 01:58:52.958]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:53.258 --> 01:58:53.879]  Number one.
[01:58:54.179 --> 01:58:57.321]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:57.602 --> 01:58:58.182]  Number two.
[01:58:58.462 --> 01:59:03.006]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:03.366 --> 01:59:03.806]  It's true.
[01:59:04.106 --> 01:59:08.650]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:08.970 --> 01:59:09.510]  Number three.
[01:59:09.791 --> 01:59:13.073]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:13.393 --> 01:59:17.056]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:17.276 --> 01:59:17.817]  Number 4.
[01:59:18.077 --> 01:59:20.439]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:20.839 --> 01:59:24.222]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:24.522 --> 01:59:24.723]  Number 5.
[01:59:25.303 --> 01:59:29.226]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:29.467 --> 01:59:34.231]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:34.511 --> 01:59:38.533]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:38.673 --> 01:59:40.234]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.454 --> 01:59:42.555]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:59:42.715 --> 01:59:45.296]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:45.316 --> 01:59:46.677]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:46.697 --> 01:59:52.800]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:03.789 --> 02:00:07.992]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:08.612 --> 02:00:09.433]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.213 --> 02:00:11.154]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:11.754 --> 02:00:15.397]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:15.957 --> 02:00:20.060]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.743 --> 02:00:27.044]  I've got a bunch of Twitter questions for Alan Watt.
[02:00:27.064 --> 02:00:28.926]  He's with us throughout the rest of the hour.
[02:00:29.086 --> 02:00:30.327]  And Doug, Chris, Stan.
[02:00:31.815 --> 02:00:33.316]  ...and others that are patiently holding.
[02:00:33.357 --> 02:00:34.698]  The total free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:00:34.918 --> 02:00:42.125]  I also want to get into the economy and military developments with him, but finishing up in this short little segment...
[02:00:43.201 --> 02:00:52.244]  We've talked about the history of the elite, their systems of control, but talking about their endgame, I mean, it is a totally selfish, horrible endgame.
[02:00:52.264 --> 02:01:02.428]  They've got all these mid-level and low-level people on power trips with their little uniforms and signets and logos of power that defend the system, having no idea what the system is.
[02:01:03.248 --> 02:01:04.788]  But the globalists are now out in the open.
[02:01:04.828 --> 02:01:16.571]  The system is exterminating eighty to ninety percent of people, having ten to twenty percent left as a suboid servant class, and the elite merging into biomechanical androids and living forever.
[02:01:16.611 --> 02:01:24.112]  Now I'm not saying that's real or going to happen, but you go back to the French Revolution and other times they promised their people, we'll give you secrets to live to a hundred.
[02:01:24.472 --> 02:01:26.473]  So they always use the same stuff.
[02:01:26.813 --> 02:01:30.013]  They always promise their socialism is some type of high-tech utopia.
[02:01:30.594 --> 02:01:32.054]  We see manifestations of that.
[02:01:32.854 --> 02:01:35.315]  So, let's spend a few minutes on what their endgame is.
[02:01:37.216 --> 02:01:47.900]  Well, again, to get the endgame, you have to go back into their ancient belief system, which is that, basically, the world was created all wrong.
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:52.322]  And their job is to perfect that which was left imperfect.
[02:01:52.982 --> 02:01:56.763]  Which means, through science, they would perfect the world, everything in it.
[02:01:57.144 --> 02:02:00.505]  We see that with the modification of plants and trees and everything today.
[02:02:01.325 --> 02:02:02.870]  And man himself, of course.
[02:02:03.838 --> 02:02:11.525]  Because they, being a dominant psychopathic type, really, and you can certainly pass on psychopathy, it's the same thing.
[02:02:11.985 --> 02:02:19.151]  If you want a pit bull, you can breed a good pit bull by interbreeding pit bulls, and you're guaranteed to have the same kind of offspring.
[02:02:19.411 --> 02:02:20.913]  Well, it's the same with these characters.
[02:02:21.713 --> 02:02:31.762]  Down through the ages, they picked the victorious type, the type who dominated whole countries eventually, either through warfare directly, or through owning the kings and queens who did the wars for you.
[02:02:32.322 --> 02:02:37.484]  So they're very aggressive, but they also believe that it can alter man himself.
[02:02:37.644 --> 02:02:40.926]  They're idiot savants of control, and they're playing God.
[02:02:42.026 --> 02:02:51.010]  In all these countless articles the last two weeks where they're saying lithium's good for you, or viruses to reprogram your brain to make you submissive, they said man's defects in all these articles.
[02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:52.250]  Man's problems.
[02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:53.451]  We're going to fix it.
[02:02:54.189 --> 02:03:04.778]  Yeah, and what they don't mention, of course, in all their articles is that, you see, they were the ones who, in the 1800s especially, came out openly with guys like H.G.
[02:03:04.838 --> 02:03:14.186]  Wells, who was specially trained by Huxley's grandfather, you know, Thomas Huxley, who was a best friend of Charles Darwin.
[02:03:14.890 --> 02:03:15.330]  And H.G.
[02:03:15.370 --> 02:03:22.856]  Wells with a bunch of other guys trained to be authors to put stuff out there for the public to be amazed by and even want to follow.
[02:03:22.896 --> 02:03:24.758]  In fact, H.G.
[02:03:24.798 --> 02:03:26.839]  Wells came up with the idea of free love.
[02:03:26.859 --> 02:03:33.244]  We've got to destroy marriage altogether because marriage is the basic institution of the tribe, be it primitive or advanced.
[02:03:33.624 --> 02:03:39.068]  And if you destroy that, you destroy basically the tribe's ability to be cohesive.
[02:03:39.989 --> 02:03:44.453]  That's what, of course, Brave New World is about, is the state controlling and raising the children.
[02:03:44.493 --> 02:03:52.079]  He stated, and of course the Wedgewoods, the Galtons, the Darwins, they all intermarried, as you said earlier.
[02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:53.600]  And the Huxleys, too.
[02:03:54.041 --> 02:03:55.962]  They all belong to the same families, actually.
[02:03:55.982 --> 02:03:58.144]  They're all related, that whole bunch you just mentioned.
[02:03:58.985 --> 02:04:06.111]  And what you find, too, is that, say, if you destroy the basic tribal necessities
[02:04:06.997 --> 02:04:09.778]  Then you destroy the tribe, and they won't fight, you see?
[02:04:10.478 --> 02:04:11.058]  They're lost.
[02:04:11.158 --> 02:04:19.421]  If you look at the Darwin theory of an advanced civilization going into a less advanced civilization, the advanced will always triumph.
[02:04:19.461 --> 02:04:20.321]  That's what they tell you.
[02:04:20.802 --> 02:04:27.724]  And what they use for an example is what happened to America when the white man came in, and what happened to the American Indians.
[02:04:28.464 --> 02:04:34.106]  The writings of John Stuart Mill is very good on this, because they knew in the 1700s what would happen to the Indians.
[02:04:34.246 --> 02:04:36.767]  Because you can't survive if you're not part of their board.
[02:04:36.847 --> 02:04:38.047]  Let's finish up with that.
[02:04:38.447 --> 02:04:41.648]  They want to make you dependent chemically, psychologically, biologically.
[02:04:41.908 --> 02:04:45.409]  Let's finish up with their master plan and then to the phone calls 800-259-9231.
[02:04:45.449 --> 02:04:46.869]  Alan Watt is our guest.
[02:04:46.889 --> 02:04:47.330]  InfoWars.com.

[02:08:02.934 --> 02:08:05.736]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:08.772 --> 02:08:11.413]  We're talking about the only issue that matters.
[02:08:11.473 --> 02:08:13.935]  The issue that encompasses everything.
[02:08:14.475 --> 02:08:16.696]  The scientific dictatorship.
[02:08:17.596 --> 02:08:23.579]  In textbook under textbook, written a hundred years ago, thirty years ago, ten years ago, a year ago.
[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:25.080]  It's all repeated.
[02:08:25.140 --> 02:08:26.261]  It's all on record.
[02:08:26.641 --> 02:08:28.922]  Vaccines to reduce your fertility or sterilize you.
[02:08:29.302 --> 02:08:32.724]  Chemicals in the food and water and packaging to sterilize you and give you cancer.
[02:08:33.524 --> 02:08:34.805]  To reduce your lifespan.
[02:08:36.340 --> 02:08:37.861]  They're lying to you about lifespan.
[02:08:38.461 --> 02:08:41.282]  In the past, large numbers of children died before the age of 10.
[02:08:41.662 --> 02:08:50.085]  If you take the low lifespan of children out, people lived into their early 80s instead of their low 70s.
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:54.663]  This is just the facts, and they admit they're doing this.
[02:08:54.723 --> 02:09:00.528]  If you're a new listener and you're like, they say they're poisoning the food and water, they say they want a world government, I heard that's a conspiracy theory.
[02:09:00.828 --> 02:09:05.373]  That's a simple throwaway line to make you procrastinate and not look into this.
[02:09:05.533 --> 02:09:07.374]  It's a hundred percent.
[02:09:08.337 --> 02:09:13.399]  It's a hundred percent on record everything Alan Watt and I are saying.
[02:09:13.879 --> 02:09:14.180]  Okay?
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:17.761]  You can differ on our interpretation, but this is going on.
[02:09:17.821 --> 02:09:19.462]  You should be angry about that.
[02:09:19.762 --> 02:09:21.363]  You should be standing up against that.
[02:09:21.723 --> 02:09:23.864]  You should have respect for yourself, but they've taken
[02:09:26.479 --> 02:09:32.961]  The basic determination away from people to where folks on the news say, I don't care if they're saving my naked body scans, I have nothing to hide.
[02:09:33.321 --> 02:09:35.042]  First they lie to you and say they're not saving it.
[02:09:35.262 --> 02:09:36.442]  They say there's no radiation.
[02:09:36.482 --> 02:09:37.563]  Now they admit it's very high.
[02:09:38.243 --> 02:09:41.204]  Now they say they're going to put cameras in all the cars watching us and tracking us.
[02:09:41.484 --> 02:09:44.525]  Cameras in the backs of the seats watching you, listening to you on the airplanes.
[02:09:44.885 --> 02:09:46.286]  This is worse than Orwell.
[02:09:46.546 --> 02:09:50.067]  People say, well there's already so much of it, I guess I'll go along with it.
[02:09:50.227 --> 02:09:51.487]  Well then, where does it end?
[02:09:51.808 --> 02:09:52.588]  Where does it stop?
[02:09:53.468 --> 02:09:55.509]  Alan, looking at time frames for these people,
[02:09:56.289 --> 02:10:00.851]  Unless we get the word out, and then they'll just back off and move slower, but right now it seems they're rushing.
[02:10:00.871 --> 02:10:01.531]  Well, it doesn't seem.
[02:10:01.551 --> 02:10:03.532]  We know they're rushing towards the goal post.
[02:10:04.612 --> 02:10:11.875]  That they're accelerating their entire program, and that all the birth pains we've seen so far were just preludes.
[02:10:11.955 --> 02:10:13.976]  That we haven't seen anything yet.
[02:10:15.476 --> 02:10:15.876]  That's right.
[02:10:15.956 --> 02:10:23.179]  Even Bush Senior, when he came out with his speech on the New World Order, he said, it's coming into view.
[02:10:24.002 --> 02:10:28.544]  It's coming into view and what he meant by that is the coming a new American century.
[02:10:28.564 --> 02:10:35.307]  This is the century of change that academia were using using that term for 50 years in the 20th century.
[02:10:35.327 --> 02:10:37.988]  The century of change with the 20th 21st century.
[02:10:38.368 --> 02:10:46.191]  That's where they had to ramp ahead because it already dumbed down the people with inoculations and so on and again bringing in processed food.
[02:10:46.989 --> 02:10:47.530]  I think?
[02:11:17.389 --> 02:11:20.271]  And he was part of the orgies with Margaret Sanger.
[02:11:21.552 --> 02:11:23.593]  Yeah, HG Wells was more than that.
[02:11:23.693 --> 02:11:30.476]  I mean, he made agreements with his three wives, I think, never to divulge what he actually got up to.
[02:11:30.536 --> 02:11:33.778]  He likes getting spanked and tied up and all this kinky stuff, you know.
[02:11:33.858 --> 02:11:39.801]  Most of these guys are perverts, you understand, that work for them higher up and near the top.
[02:11:39.821 --> 02:11:42.042]  They're all pseudo-masochistic types.
[02:11:42.402 --> 02:11:45.024]  See, pseudo-masochism is a big part of this because
[02:11:45.764 --> 02:11:54.372]  A sadomasochist wants to get up into the power ranks when they're psychopathic, and they really worship the person above them.
[02:11:54.432 --> 02:11:55.213]  They'll worship them.
[02:11:56.054 --> 02:12:00.198]  And they despise the person down below, even the next level down.
[02:12:00.798 --> 02:12:04.642]  Even the military structure has been weak, and they'll abuse them.
[02:12:05.162 --> 02:12:06.644]  So that's your sadomasochist.
[02:12:06.684 --> 02:12:11.208]  They flock into being willing servants for these guys who run the world.
[02:12:12.049 --> 02:12:22.739]  And again, it's an old technique that's well understood by them, but they always have these odd perversions to do with sadomasochistic tendencies in their sexual life as well, yeah.
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:32.027]  Let's go ahead and take some phone calls, but before I do that, Alan, any other issues or items that you think are important that should be discussed today?
[02:12:33.277 --> 02:12:42.602]  Yes, because what we don't understand is, it's simple, you take the primitive tribe, we're all really just basically primitive, tribal, with tribal instincts.
[02:12:42.942 --> 02:12:54.868]  You destroy all of those, you destroy your cultural taboos, and when you have nothing left to hold on to, then you're in free fall, and they can then guide you as to where you're going to go in that new free fall.
[02:12:55.428 --> 02:12:58.069]  That's what they've done with most of society.
[02:12:58.409 --> 02:13:08.052]  If they don't replace all that that they've destroyed, you end up with the people like the American Indians who, like in Canada, are simply abject cases.
[02:13:08.112 --> 02:13:09.893]  They're chronic alcoholics.
[02:13:10.533 --> 02:13:13.274]  All the reasons for living have been taken away.
[02:13:13.414 --> 02:13:15.334]  All their old customs are taken away.
[02:13:15.714 --> 02:13:17.535]  Things that gave them meaning are destroyed.
[02:13:18.215 --> 02:13:19.676]  And that's what they do.
[02:13:20.336 --> 02:13:29.682]  And they've had big scandals where they take the little Indian children, the natives, currently, this was even in the news, and they just kill them there at the facility.
[02:13:29.702 --> 02:13:30.142]  They murder them.
[02:13:31.508 --> 02:13:32.108]  Yes, they do.
[02:13:32.188 --> 02:13:37.109]  They're still digging them up in Canada, at some of these places out west, in fact.
[02:13:37.690 --> 02:13:45.231]  But it's very similar to what I've done with the European races that came into North America now, and the Europeans themselves.
[02:13:45.251 --> 02:13:48.712]  Their cultures were attacked later in the same way.
[02:13:48.812 --> 02:13:55.214]  Once we'd been over the Industrial Revolution, created the scientific things they needed to control us, we all worked towards it.
[02:13:55.314 --> 02:13:56.134]  Our dads and
[02:14:01.397 --> 02:14:07.901]  Well, I mean, looking at psychology and anthropology, and then we're going to calls, but I want your view on this, Alan.
[02:14:08.621 --> 02:14:18.387]  If you look at the American culture that Alexander de Tocqueville wrote about, a French historian or others, all strong cultures are self-sufficient.
[02:14:19.008 --> 02:14:20.389]  The family's number one.
[02:14:20.409 --> 02:14:24.451]  A husband wouldn't do something mean to his wife because he understands it's part of the unit.
[02:14:24.471 --> 02:14:25.452]  The wife wouldn't do it.
[02:14:26.277 --> 02:14:26.938]  The children?
[02:14:27.399 --> 02:14:27.679]  No.
[02:14:28.140 --> 02:14:29.922]  The only people they can count on is their family.
[02:14:30.383 --> 02:14:35.109]  Now through the sitcoms and the movies and the women's magazines, it's fun to break up.
[02:14:35.450 --> 02:14:36.831]  It's fun to fight with each other.
[02:14:37.232 --> 02:14:41.137]  So they can isolate you as the individual animal and destroy you.
[02:14:41.818 --> 02:14:46.320]  And now you look at it, and quote, feminism is supposed to empower women.
[02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:49.282]  It's turned them into just bestial creatures.
[02:14:49.362 --> 02:14:50.302]  Same thing with men.
[02:14:50.883 --> 02:14:59.067]  They give us false tribes of UT football instead of the normal tribalism of your family and your private property and controlling your own mind.
[02:14:59.087 --> 02:15:03.109]  And you try to talk to full-grown adults, they're mental midgets.
[02:15:03.149 --> 02:15:06.330]  A serious man can't be obsessed with sports.
[02:15:07.611 --> 02:15:09.652]  Because there's too much going on in the world.
[02:15:09.692 --> 02:15:10.512]  Too much knowledge.
[02:15:10.532 --> 02:15:11.353]  Too many mysteries.
[02:15:11.593 --> 02:15:12.393]  Too many secrets.
[02:15:13.074 --> 02:15:14.934]  Too many competitors.
[02:15:14.994 --> 02:15:15.575]  Too much.
[02:15:16.035 --> 02:15:19.917]  They don't want us being dominant and strong and aggressive and powerful and wild.
[02:15:20.177 --> 02:15:21.938]  They want us being a bunch of soft punks.
[02:15:21.998 --> 02:15:22.418]  And we are.
[02:15:22.618 --> 02:15:23.899]  We're a bunch of soft punks.
[02:15:24.679 --> 02:15:25.039]  That's right.
[02:15:25.339 --> 02:15:33.344]  And that's what you do as the end product of a long-term war to destroy everything that made things function and made you independent.
[02:15:33.844 --> 02:15:36.165]  And now you won't stand up and fight for anything.
[02:15:36.585 --> 02:15:38.526]  That's exactly the goal they had in mind.
[02:15:39.327 --> 02:15:39.907]  Well said.
[02:15:39.927 --> 02:15:41.808]  Alan Watt is our guest.
[02:15:41.848 --> 02:15:42.989]  CuttingToTheMatrix.com.
[02:15:43.029 --> 02:15:45.730]  Our sites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:49.692]  Let's talk to Doug in Utah, who I'm told disagrees.
[02:15:49.712 --> 02:15:50.572]  He'll go to the head of the line.
[02:15:50.612 --> 02:15:51.193]  Go ahead, Doug.
[02:15:52.150 --> 02:15:58.760]  Hi, yeah, Alex and Alan, I disagreed with Alex's opinion yesterday.
[02:15:58.780 --> 02:16:03.287]  He talked about Stephen Hawking's opinion that we must go off world immediately or it's almost
[02:16:04.286 --> 02:16:08.268]  Well, that doesn't mean leave the planet.
[02:16:08.428 --> 02:16:15.530]  I'm saying we need to expand and not have the technologies hidden from us.
[02:16:16.030 --> 02:16:24.473]  And I agree with him, there's a good chance with all these super weapons and genetic engineering that we're going to have serious catastrophes and the globalists are arrogant and think they can control it.
[02:16:24.513 --> 02:16:26.594]  But finish your point and we'll get Alan's take on it.
[02:16:27.037 --> 02:16:34.499]  Yeah, you said it's a virtual certainty that this planet will never become a Type I civilization with the assault on mankind from the elite.
[02:16:35.119 --> 02:16:42.241]  And what my problem was, is that vision is totally contrary to the vision that the Holy Prophets of God described first in the scriptures.
[02:16:42.301 --> 02:16:47.923]  And I wondered if Alan had a take on that, because, you know, those are really the primary
[02:16:48.559 --> 02:16:49.260]  I don't know.
[02:17:05.809 --> 02:17:11.112]  talked about in his series on Dune, giving you an off-world model of that.
[02:17:11.733 --> 02:17:30.745]  I am a Christian, and I've read the Bible, but in the last 150 years, you've had this move to say, never stand up to evil, it's the end of the world, you can't change things, and that's just not true, and they've got this Christianoid model now, where we can't even have destiny, or we can't, I mean,
[02:17:31.345 --> 02:17:33.928]  People told the Founding Fathers don't fight back, it's the end of the world.
[02:17:34.388 --> 02:17:37.031]  People told the Germans lay down to Hitler, it's the end of the world.
[02:17:37.272 --> 02:17:39.154]  And I find it to be a cop-out.
[02:17:39.194 --> 02:17:41.096]  Let me get a comment from Alan Watt on that.
[02:17:42.378 --> 02:17:48.785]  Yes, I mean religion's always been used by the powerful organizations that end up taking them over.
[02:17:49.566 --> 02:17:56.393]  And you'll find that I personally see the Old Testament, for instance, in a totally different way than most people.
[02:17:56.934 --> 02:18:03.040]  I see it more like a guidebook of practical means of conquering the world, actually.
[02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:03.921]  That's how I see it.
[02:18:04.822 --> 02:18:11.890]  I see the New Testament with a different deity in charge altogether from the old bloodthirsty Yahweh.
[02:18:12.641 --> 02:18:23.071]  And Christianity in its basic initial form before it was taken over by, remember an empire took it over, a political military empire took it over and used it.
[02:18:24.092 --> 02:18:37.684]  Initial Christianity was very simplistic in its doctrine and so they used it again once it was taken over, they used it again to dominate people for one and a half thousand years really.
[02:18:38.513 --> 02:18:42.878]  And then the Protestant sect, it was time to bring in the Protestants, and that's how I see it.
[02:18:42.898 --> 02:18:45.921]  It was time to bring in the Protestants by those who ruled the money.
[02:18:45.941 --> 02:18:47.362]  Yeah, let me say this to Doug.
[02:18:47.703 --> 02:18:48.724]  Let me say this to Doug.
[02:18:48.784 --> 02:18:58.794]  Look, you injected religion into this, and I happen to know Alan's views, and that's one of the few areas that we differ on, but I do see his perspective, and that's why all things are open for discussion here, but
[02:18:59.895 --> 02:19:05.277]  But overall, you know, at my parents' church, my dad said, man, I don't know if I'm going to be able to go there anymore.
[02:19:05.297 --> 02:19:09.619]  We got new preachers there, and they're teaching us that we've got to have the illegal aliens basically come in.
[02:19:09.939 --> 02:19:15.662]  That's the World Council of Churches and the Rockefellers, or Catholic and Protestant churches saying, turn your guns in.
[02:19:15.982 --> 02:19:20.184]  And FEMA secretly recruiting 50-plus thousand preachers for clergy response teams.
[02:19:20.584 --> 02:19:25.506]  I mean, we've got to recognize that they're telling us just give up, lay down, it's what Jesus says.
[02:19:25.786 --> 02:19:27.547]  And that's not what Jesus even said, Alan.
[02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:36.604]  Yeah, Jesus didn't tell you to leave your head at the door, you know, of the church.
[02:19:37.245 --> 02:19:38.346]  You were supposed to use your head.
[02:19:38.866 --> 02:19:40.347]  Well, he went after the money changers.
[02:19:40.387 --> 02:19:42.068]  He went after the money power.
[02:19:42.388 --> 02:19:44.310]  That was the last thing, basically, he did.
[02:19:44.430 --> 02:19:46.691]  Once they did that, everything changed.
[02:19:48.032 --> 02:19:49.333]  That wasn't just money changers.
[02:19:49.373 --> 02:19:51.495]  That was an international bank of the day.
[02:19:52.275 --> 02:19:52.655]  Stay there.
[02:19:52.855 --> 02:19:53.196]  Stay there.
[02:19:53.296 --> 02:19:55.157]  Let's talk about that when we come back and go to more calls.
[02:19:55.177 --> 02:19:56.318]  Interesting point, Doug.
[02:19:59.315 --> 02:20:08.401]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:20:08.521 --> 02:20:11.883]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[02:20:12.083 --> 02:20:21.529]  In producing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[02:20:21.690 --> 02:20:26.933]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[02:20:27.213 --> 02:20:29.394]  Off the Grid News is fiercely independent.

[02:20:42.677 --> 02:20:47.158]  And the best part, this $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[02:20:47.298 --> 02:20:47.738]  That's right.

[02:22:00.245 --> 02:22:04.089]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[02:22:04.129 --> 02:22:05.390]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:22:05.550 --> 02:22:09.114]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:22:09.414 --> 02:22:11.916]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[02:22:12.337 --> 02:22:14.079]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:22:14.399 --> 02:22:16.701]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:22:17.762 --> 02:22:23.345]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:22:23.385 --> 02:22:25.886]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:22:33.430 --> 02:22:35.332]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[02:23:14.777 --> 02:23:16.498]  And not the cause of sinus problems.

[02:23:50.394 --> 02:23:50.795]  It works!
[02:24:01.989 --> 02:24:11.194]  Up at the website GCNLive.com, headlines, wave goodbye to Brand Obama, Paul Joseph Watson, key article about how his fortunes are imploding.
[02:24:11.214 --> 02:24:13.656]  Now the Globals are already vetting new puppets.
[02:24:14.176 --> 02:24:23.642]  Also, Alex Jones, 11-minute clip on Russia Today, Big Brother is watching you, dealing with the Internet takeover and cameras and cars and planes to watch and record you, both audio and video.
[02:24:24.562 --> 02:24:26.704]  Yeah, you'd understand that Judaism even in that time
[02:24:50.916 --> 02:24:51.976]  We're good to go.
[02:25:13.602 --> 02:25:19.786]  Yeah, the main manipulation was they made you buy a special coin to buy your sacrifice, whether it was a cow or a sheep or birds.
[02:25:42.219 --> 02:25:46.760]  And they would be huge piles of gold and silver for one little special silver coin.
[02:25:47.501 --> 02:25:53.982]  Yeah, foreign cash was unclean inside the temple, but it was awfully good outside for the guys who exchanged it.
[02:25:54.683 --> 02:25:58.024]  And they set the exchange rates, and it literally was a going concern.
[02:25:58.104 --> 02:26:01.905]  And they came from all over the ancient world to exchange their monies there, yeah.
[02:26:02.445 --> 02:26:03.025]  Amazing.
[02:26:03.645 --> 02:26:05.806]  I hope that answers Doug's question.
[02:26:07.106 --> 02:26:08.867]  Let's talk to Jeff in Texas.
[02:26:08.947 --> 02:26:09.847]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[02:26:10.796 --> 02:26:13.538]  Hey Alex, man, this is really great.
[02:26:13.578 --> 02:26:15.439]  This is my second time listening to you.
[02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:19.382]  Yesterday, now today, and I feel pretty at home.
[02:26:19.442 --> 02:26:26.607]  I've been actually paying attention on another level through the internet and just noticing things and experiencing my life.
[02:26:27.188 --> 02:26:34.433]  I'm a reformed old hippie from the 60s, so I know what all the culture's about, and I've been around to see just what everybody's into.
[02:26:35.273 --> 02:26:42.218]  But I think where I'm going now, I've kind of developed to this point where what you were talking about earlier, the electronic money.
[02:26:42.258 --> 02:26:48.182]  I mean, it looks to me, I'll put it this way, Obama, you know, I was a Bush hater when he came.
[02:26:48.202 --> 02:26:55.047]  I mean, I had tears and I was just like overwhelmed and just, oh, my life was just so wonderful.
[02:26:55.087 --> 02:26:58.509]  Here we've got an African American man as president.
[02:26:58.549 --> 02:27:00.431]  We've come so far because I was in,
[02:27:01.112 --> 02:27:03.053]  I went to my buddy's black weddings.
[02:27:03.153 --> 02:27:08.776]  I was into the black culture and people way back when in the 60s and I loved the whole thing.
[02:27:09.497 --> 02:27:12.879]  And then I started realizing the details and I was kind of in denial.
[02:27:12.939 --> 02:27:14.419]  I think so many people are.
[02:27:14.439 --> 02:27:22.484]  Obama's 6% African and it's just a corporate production to sucker people that things that really change when it's just more of the same.
[02:27:22.504 --> 02:27:23.745]  But getting back to digital money.
[02:27:24.705 --> 02:27:31.870]  That's why they're cracking down on swap meets, on garage sales, on bartering with your neighbor.
[02:27:32.191 --> 02:27:36.494]  They want everything tracked and controlled so they can turn the economy off.
[02:27:37.755 --> 02:27:42.698]  Dealing with that and also Obama and the fraud that was Obama.
[02:27:42.798 --> 02:27:44.019]  Alan Watt, give us your breakdown.
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:52.986]  Well, you'll never change a system when the people come in to vote, to come in and lead the same system.
[02:27:53.943 --> 02:28:06.930]  Of central banking, international banking, debt, which is incredible to start with, since every central bank can print its own money if it wishes to, but they all prefer to borrow from the private banks, that's the con.
[02:28:07.430 --> 02:28:19.416]  Everybody, I don't care if you've got Mickey Mouse coming in to run for election, if he's going to stand up for the same system, including all the previously owned debt, rather than saying I'm writing it all off, it's all bogus anyway.
[02:28:20.191 --> 02:28:26.435]  And that's why they're trying to block us taking the states back, because we've got a shot at that, not really at the federal government.
[02:28:41.587 --> 02:28:54.699]  Yes, we're already international and that was the key to setting up international banks and central banks as well to go with the World Bank and using this debt con to push it all.
[02:28:54.739 --> 02:28:56.041]  Since World War II, the US
[02:28:57.186 --> 02:29:01.189]  And Britain and Canada have been funding through their OECD departments.
[02:29:01.249 --> 02:29:02.990]  They're all set up during World War II.
[02:29:03.990 --> 02:29:08.013]  Across the third world, we're funding China right now for their medical care.
[02:29:08.573 --> 02:29:09.434]  So is the U.S.
[02:29:09.894 --> 02:29:16.258]  Canada is building a can-do nuclear reactor to their freedom in China, courtesy of the Canadian taxpayer.
[02:29:16.318 --> 02:29:24.944]  They're the new model, and the $50 billion for the auto bailouts, most of it went to move our factories to Brazil, Eastern Europe, and China.
[02:29:25.666 --> 02:29:26.367]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:29:26.647 --> 02:29:32.891]  And this is all done by the same system that wants you to vote for the next guy who will promise to uphold the same system.
[02:29:33.792 --> 02:29:35.053]  All right, Jeff, appreciate your call.
[02:29:35.093 --> 02:29:35.873]  Good to have you on board.
[02:29:36.273 --> 02:29:37.214]  Please pay it forward.
[02:29:37.234 --> 02:29:38.355]  Spread the word about the broadcast.

[02:29:49.223 --> 02:29:50.123]  We're on the march.

[02:30:02.851 --> 02:30:03.752]  Tyranny is here.
[02:30:04.112 --> 02:30:07.636]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:07.656 --> 02:30:10.258]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:10.278 --> 02:30:15.323]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:30:16.124 --> 02:30:22.390]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:28.335]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:30:28.775 --> 02:30:32.439]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:30:32.939 --> 02:30:36.943]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:30:37.223 --> 02:30:42.748]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:43.189 --> 02:30:46.172]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:30:46.732 --> 02:30:48.174]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:30:48.714 --> 02:30:49.215]  It's here.

[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.140]  After 7, what's the point?

[02:35:18.485 --> 02:35:19.166]  Great system.
[02:35:19.266 --> 02:35:22.946]  The solar panel, the control unit, the battery unit, it's a wonderful system.
[02:35:23.386 --> 02:35:26.887]  We've been promoting these for three years, and our listeners just give me rave reviews.
[02:35:27.567 --> 02:35:29.948]  Get into solar today with a great organization.
[02:35:30.788 --> 02:35:34.494]  The folks at Solutions from Science, get a free information pack 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, or MySolarBackup.com.
[02:35:34.534 --> 02:35:35.495]  That's MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[02:35:46.571 --> 02:35:48.512]  First of all, I just want to say what you're doing is great.
[02:36:16.309 --> 02:36:17.470]  You're a hero to us all.
[02:36:17.890 --> 02:36:24.515]  I mean, there's lots of, with everything that's going on, everybody calling you a crackpot and this and that.
[02:36:24.696 --> 02:36:29.199]  They're the crackpots, really, to be quite honest.
[02:36:29.219 --> 02:36:30.180]  Well, they're not intellectual.
[02:36:30.220 --> 02:36:32.381]  They can't have a historical debate.
[02:36:32.762 --> 02:36:36.745]  It's just easy to have a throwaway one-way line of, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:36:38.103 --> 02:36:41.866]  Yeah, you ask them a direct question and it's dodging, dodging, dodging, dodging.
[02:36:41.886 --> 02:36:50.331]  Well, time is on our side, Chris, because I told people 12, 13, 14 years ago they were taking blood from babies at birth for the Pentagon, now it's admitted.
[02:36:50.652 --> 02:36:53.914]  I told folks a year ago they're saving the body scans as we have the documents.
[02:36:54.354 --> 02:36:59.258]  I told people they were going to put cameras in your cars to watch you and in all the airline seats to record you.
[02:36:59.278 --> 02:37:03.721]  And it's all, I mean, look, I'm going off what they say they're going to do and what they're doing.
[02:37:04.381 --> 02:37:06.163]  And so, I've got the facts.
[02:37:06.503 --> 02:37:07.424]  They've got baloney.
[02:37:07.925 --> 02:37:10.928]  And so, the general public hears me say something a decade before.
[02:37:11.168 --> 02:37:12.109]  They say, oh, he's a kook.
[02:37:12.330 --> 02:37:15.093]  Then they hear it later and go, wow, that guy isn't a kook.
[02:37:15.133 --> 02:37:17.035]  But, any questions for Alan Watt?
[02:37:18.032 --> 02:37:19.733]  Well yeah, I have a question.
[02:37:19.753 --> 02:37:23.836]  It's a couple questions and either of you can field them.
[02:37:24.056 --> 02:37:25.658]  It doesn't matter either or.
[02:37:26.058 --> 02:37:36.926]  But I've got to tread carefully with a couple of these questions because I don't want you to... I know that you attacked... I wouldn't say attacked, but you defended yourself the other day and I don't want to come off like...
[02:37:37.606 --> 02:37:46.871]  I don't care if somebody is against me, but when somebody calls in and just makes something up, sometimes I'll get angry.
[02:37:46.891 --> 02:37:53.254]  But at the same time, I don't want to make this about me.
[02:37:53.774 --> 02:37:54.875]  Number one, it's dangerous.
[02:37:54.955 --> 02:37:57.416]  Number two, we're going to win by waking others up.
[02:37:57.756 --> 02:38:00.277]  So we're here talking about the global elite enslaving us.
[02:38:00.358 --> 02:38:01.418]  No one can deny it now.
[02:38:03.619 --> 02:38:04.720]  I don't want to make it about me.
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:06.761]  Listen, I've got a lot of callers I want to get to.
[02:38:06.801 --> 02:38:07.801]  Chris, go ahead and get to your points.
[02:38:08.381 --> 02:38:09.242]  Well, let me hurry up.
[02:38:09.682 --> 02:38:17.445]  First of all, I just want to say that I've got a good judgment on when I meet people and I hear people, whether or not they're decent.
[02:38:17.465 --> 02:38:22.208]  I can usually tell in the first few seconds of interacting with someone what kind of person they are.
[02:38:22.488 --> 02:38:25.269]  I get a sense that you're genuinely good.
[02:38:26.099 --> 02:38:28.800]  Um, and you've also empowered me to do the same.
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:39.362]  Uh, I do a lot of, uh, since, since hearing, uh, things you've had to tell me, information you've empowered me with, I have gone ahead and spread that information to as many people as I possibly can.
[02:38:39.882 --> 02:38:45.403]  Uh, my question is, or question, one of my questions are, do you think this can be realistically stopped?
[02:38:45.703 --> 02:38:48.964]  Any, all this, all these things that, that are on the, on the move.
[02:38:49.522 --> 02:38:52.605]  You think any of them realistically can be stopped?
[02:38:52.705 --> 02:38:54.086]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:38:54.127 --> 02:38:57.169]  I'm going to get Alan's take on what you just said.
[02:38:57.250 --> 02:38:57.890]  He's our guest.
[02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:58.551]  Go ahead, Alan.
[02:39:00.032 --> 02:39:04.597]  Well, I don't think... People think in numbers.
[02:39:05.558 --> 02:39:06.498]  The mass man.
[02:39:06.538 --> 02:39:07.620]  That's how we're used.
[02:39:07.660 --> 02:39:09.341]  In fact, we're used as the mass man.
[02:39:09.361 --> 02:39:10.242]  We're very predictable.
[02:39:10.923 --> 02:39:13.185]  It's the few who change society.
[02:39:13.245 --> 02:39:14.186]  It's always been that way.
[02:39:15.908 --> 02:39:21.131]  But what it means too is that you have to re-evaluate yourself and your own values.
[02:39:21.211 --> 02:39:25.755]  Because remember, today's values are different from 50 year ago values.
[02:39:26.235 --> 02:39:28.617]  We've been totally turned upside down in fact.
[02:39:29.057 --> 02:39:37.903]  But to get back to what is personally sustainable, that's the real meaning of sustainability for yourself and for those that you love.
[02:39:38.673 --> 02:39:48.462]  And it really means getting back to personal values and where you can make a promise and keep it and even make a vow and keep it and get back to to your own integrity.
[02:39:48.522 --> 02:39:49.784]  People have no anchor.
[02:39:50.564 --> 02:39:51.445]  They have no anchor.
[02:39:51.465 --> 02:39:52.446]  They have no compass.
[02:39:52.566 --> 02:39:52.947]  And then
[02:39:54.249 --> 02:39:58.092]  They'll also say, you look like a nice person, you sound convincing.
[02:39:58.412 --> 02:40:04.977]  It isn't my opinion that there were a riot in Atlanta over, you know, food stamps and housing.
[02:40:05.277 --> 02:40:09.961]  It's not my opinion that I read from the Rockefeller Foundation about vaccines to sterilize you.
[02:40:10.201 --> 02:40:18.107]  It's not my opinion that BP, you know, A, bisphenol A is sterilizing people and causing cancer.
[02:40:18.427 --> 02:40:22.751]  I mean, again, so the establishment always tries to make it about Alex Jones.
[02:40:23.251 --> 02:40:24.431]  Or about Alan Watt?
[02:40:24.771 --> 02:40:28.172]  Folks, this is information for you to make a decision about.
[02:40:28.752 --> 02:40:31.933]  This isn't about, I wonder what I'll do, do I trust Alex or not?
[02:40:32.253 --> 02:40:33.473]  You shouldn't trust me.
[02:40:34.113 --> 02:40:35.974]  You should go look at the information.
[02:40:36.054 --> 02:40:37.054]  It's not about me.
[02:40:37.414 --> 02:40:41.495]  I'm a guy here trying to warn people so we can stop the globalists.
[02:40:42.435 --> 02:40:48.816]  And nothing irritates me more, and I'm not mad at Chris, but it sounded like he was like building up to something, he didn't go there, about me.
[02:40:48.836 --> 02:40:51.117]  I mean, I'm just so tired of it because
[02:40:52.413 --> 02:40:54.996]  Probably half the websites out there don't fight the New World Order.
[02:40:55.016 --> 02:41:00.763]  They talk about Alex Jones because I'm the biggest thing out here doing this and it just shows they're malfunctioning.
[02:41:01.103 --> 02:41:01.704]  They can't...
[02:41:03.652 --> 02:41:04.733]  I guess they're followers.
[02:41:05.133 --> 02:41:06.214]  I don't understand it, Alan.
[02:41:06.234 --> 02:41:09.296]  I mean, do you get where I'm going with this?
[02:41:09.837 --> 02:41:11.378]  It's a backlash.
[02:41:11.478 --> 02:41:16.142]  When you burst people's bubbles, people do live in a bubble of comfort.
[02:41:16.282 --> 02:41:24.008]  They're egocentronic because they've been given an egocentronic culture, an egocentric culture, and a narcissistic culture.
[02:41:24.028 --> 02:41:28.391]  We've also been domesticated where most folk out there truly want to believe.
[02:41:28.431 --> 02:41:31.594]  They want to believe, even though they're little suspicions, but they want to believe.
[02:41:32.034 --> 02:41:35.597]  That there are special people up there taking care of them because they love them.
[02:41:36.217 --> 02:41:44.483]  And when you burst the bubble, it takes away everything that the ground goes from underneath their feet of nothing to stand on, that they've lived a fallacy.
[02:41:44.803 --> 02:41:49.966]  And here you are telling them what the evil things are being done to them and evil things are planned to them.
[02:41:50.387 --> 02:41:57.792]  But you're using the documentation from the science magazines, from the mainstream media, from the big organizations and foundations involved.
[02:41:58.252 --> 02:42:03.213]  But rather than look at what you're giving them for evidence, they'll attack you personally.
[02:42:03.453 --> 02:42:04.314]  That's a standard.
[02:42:04.374 --> 02:42:09.115]  Well, they'll also spin it and say, I thought the mainstream media is a bunch of liars, Alex.
[02:42:09.655 --> 02:42:11.535]  And sometimes they do lie.
[02:42:12.315 --> 02:42:14.696]  Like they're saying Rand Paul said, get rid of the Civil Rights Act.
[02:42:14.736 --> 02:42:16.056]  But most of the time, they spin it.
[02:42:16.096 --> 02:42:24.158]  They say, isn't it great that the Austin Police Department is putting in cameras for $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 a piece.
[02:42:24.318 --> 02:42:26.519]  No one should ask why they're 10 times what they should cost.
[02:42:27.239 --> 02:42:31.160]  And they're now using the cameras that were supposedly for traffic control.
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:34.682]  I mean, here's security cameras on Rundberg Lane.
[02:42:34.702 --> 02:42:36.082]  APD talks about their use.
[02:42:37.002 --> 02:42:38.503]  Five cameras alone will cost $350,000.
[02:42:38.863 --> 02:42:44.345]  You know, no one asked why did they lie to us and say they weren't for police at first.
[02:42:44.725 --> 02:42:46.806]  They'll say, well, why are you covering mainstream news?
[02:42:47.126 --> 02:42:48.826]  They're telling us how good it is.
[02:42:49.166 --> 02:42:51.447]  I'm taking their admission and pointing out how it's bad.
[02:42:53.028 --> 02:42:56.509]  I've seen the technique work before, and I went through
[02:42:57.354 --> 02:43:04.975]  When Britain was being completely de-industrialized for a few years, every day on the news it was one factory more unemployment.
[02:43:05.580 --> 02:43:14.187]  But after the news was over, you go into a comedy show, a regular comedy show, or a TV drama, so everything was okay.
[02:43:14.247 --> 02:43:15.989]  You have this double-mindedness.
[02:43:16.689 --> 02:43:19.431]  And it was so bad that people were committing suicides.
[02:43:19.772 --> 02:43:25.757]  Britain ended up having the highest suicide rates in Europe because people just couldn't get jobs.
[02:43:25.797 --> 02:43:32.022]  Margaret Thatcher came on and said, a generation is growing up now who will never see work in their lifetime, so get used to it.
[02:43:33.024 --> 02:43:33.344]  And I
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:54.441]  Oh yeah, I get that all the time.
[02:43:54.501 --> 02:43:56.362]  Don't talk about dollar devaluation.
[02:43:56.402 --> 02:44:00.845]  Don't talk about global depression when all the major think tanks admit they're engineering it.
[02:44:01.265 --> 02:44:04.287]  Because I'm gonna cause it by being negative, Alan.
[02:44:04.587 --> 02:44:06.649]  I'm supposed to just love NAFTA and GATT.
[02:44:09.614 --> 02:44:12.556]  And of course the whole New Age religion has been put out there too.
[02:44:12.937 --> 02:44:14.958]  And remember too... Yeah, the secret!
[02:44:15.098 --> 02:44:18.021]  You're supposed to imagine positive things and you get it.
[02:44:18.101 --> 02:44:19.302]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:44:19.382 --> 02:44:27.268]  And remember too, it was the Scottish writer Freed Masonry's own journal that came out in the 1950s saying that they would bring in the New Age.
[02:44:28.349 --> 02:44:30.530]  And that was the name, in fact, of their journal.
[02:44:30.610 --> 02:44:31.531]  Eventually they changed it.
[02:44:31.611 --> 02:44:32.732]  They were more of a magazine.
[02:44:33.530 --> 02:44:34.050]  And by the way...
[02:44:56.437 --> 02:44:58.558]  We're going back to calls, but well said, Alan Watt.
[02:44:58.578 --> 02:45:05.539]  The way I describe narcissism is I stopped being a narcissist at about age three, which is normal for a small child to be narcissistic.
[02:45:05.559 --> 02:45:07.500]  You know, they're learning about themselves and their identity.
[02:45:08.620 --> 02:45:11.421]  But I noticed other children would do play games.
[02:45:11.541 --> 02:45:14.001]  They'd be Batman, they'd be Robin, they'd be the Hulk.
[02:45:14.721 --> 02:45:16.802]  And I figured out this is a game.
[02:45:17.622 --> 02:45:18.522]  This isn't real.
[02:45:18.602 --> 02:45:21.903]  It's like dress-up, like girls dressing up when they're five years old to be princess.
[02:45:22.663 --> 02:45:24.924]  And I realize now when I watch yuppies and adults,
[02:45:26.172 --> 02:45:47.804]  They're all in their own little dress-up world, their own little, they're walking around on delusional power trips, and they buy whatever the media tells them to get as the trinkets and the uniform of that, and you try to talk to them, and they're not there, and they'll do this little enjoyment smile of like, mmm, I'm better than you, and if you try to talk to them, they take it as you're weak.
[02:45:48.561 --> 02:45:52.003]  You know, and they walk around and act tough and ignore people.
[02:45:52.063 --> 02:45:54.124]  It's kind of like junior high with the cool kids.
[02:45:54.384 --> 02:46:02.588]  And they're just pathetic jellyfish losers who can't even see the galactic space they're in with all the wonderment and magic.
[02:46:02.908 --> 02:46:04.669]  I mean, they're just blobs.
[02:46:05.329 --> 02:46:06.710]  They're incredible scum!
[02:46:08.110 --> 02:46:11.552]  What you're looking at, too, is the cult of celebrity.
[02:46:12.423 --> 02:46:23.702]  It's been risen to an amazing new height and people follow them religiously and they copy the fashions, they copy the actors, they copy the lifestyles as best they can according to their budget.
[02:46:24.301 --> 02:46:30.645]  And in their fantasy little world, where they have no power at all, they feel they have power in this fantasy world.
[02:46:30.685 --> 02:46:32.367]  It's no different than a driver today.
[02:46:32.787 --> 02:46:37.410]  An average guy who feels powerless gets behind a wheel and suddenly he's the king of the road.
[02:46:38.050 --> 02:46:40.752]  And because it's the only place he feels he's got any power.
[02:46:40.772 --> 02:46:44.094]  It's the same thing with your little dream world of narcissism.
[02:46:44.214 --> 02:46:47.817]  Because most folks, they secretly know that they are technically powerless.
[02:46:48.484 --> 02:46:54.309]  And they would become powerful if they would admit the Matrix and wake up, but they believe they have power within the Matrix.
[02:46:54.889 --> 02:47:03.235]  And now you have people spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in these simulation online games to buy houses and cars and real things.
[02:47:03.776 --> 02:47:14.004]  Then they have real world relationships and parties where people show up and they go, he's the movie director, you know, in this online fiction game and people are groveling to it.
[02:47:14.918 --> 02:47:19.339]  Yes, and that shows you the incredible brain damage that they have, and I really mean that.
[02:47:19.519 --> 02:47:23.560]  People do have brain damage from their inoculations and from their food.
[02:47:23.580 --> 02:47:25.021]  There has been a covert war.
[02:47:25.521 --> 02:47:27.861]  You're seeing the end product of it now.
[02:47:28.421 --> 02:47:35.223]  The IQ has officially dropped, and it's been admitted by the United Nations and the Western world.
[02:47:35.243 --> 02:47:37.284]  Yeah, they say 10 points, but they've changed the test.
[02:47:37.324 --> 02:47:37.924]  They're skewing it.
[02:47:37.944 --> 02:47:38.424]  What, more like 20?
[02:47:39.577 --> 02:47:40.118]  That's right.
[02:47:40.238 --> 02:47:48.546]  And therefore, your ability for self-preservation, which is an essential part of warfare, you must destroy that part and an enemy if you want to take them down.
[02:47:48.966 --> 02:47:50.768]  They have been doing it quietly, covertly.
[02:47:51.208 --> 02:47:57.134]  In fact, again, Brzezinski and other ones, and even Muscle too, came out and said that this will happen to the public.
[02:47:58.155 --> 02:48:00.017]  They won't know where their opinions are coming from.
[02:48:00.037 --> 02:48:01.298]  The technotronic age!
[02:48:01.758 --> 02:48:08.422]  Where they're just mindless vessels to be filled and where they have no initiative, no nothing.
[02:48:08.442 --> 02:48:10.363]  They don't even understand they're in the middle of a war.
[02:48:10.744 --> 02:48:12.705]  They're just running around feeling cool.
[02:48:12.745 --> 02:48:15.607]  It's like guys that wear all the affliction wear.
[02:48:15.627 --> 02:48:25.693]  Russell actually said that eventually because of these techniques, and he meant covert techniques, they would never tell you what they were doing to you in reality.
[02:48:26.354 --> 02:48:35.320]  He said eventually the thought of rebellion will be as foreign to them and as impossible as sheep complaining about the price of mutton.
[02:48:35.660 --> 02:48:42.824]  Exactly, but the point is I'm not against the gladiatorial stuff or the guys that want to be tough, but I've talked to bar owners and people.
[02:48:43.325 --> 02:48:46.647]  They won't even let folks in with the UFC clothes.
[02:48:47.647 --> 02:48:57.954]  uh... or or the affliction stuff because it's like they put it on and now they're an ultimate fighter and they're just crazed running around feeling tough that's another microcosm example
[02:48:58.962 --> 02:48:59.142]  Mm-hmm.
[02:48:59.322 --> 02:49:00.123]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:49:00.423 --> 02:49:02.063]  But again, it's the cult of celebrity.
[02:49:02.104 --> 02:49:10.047]  They said they would do this, and the celebrities, people follow them so meticulously and religiously and try to become them.
[02:49:10.287 --> 02:49:15.130]  Remember, Plato said the same thing, that they will use, and he said it in these terms.
[02:49:15.590 --> 02:49:21.473]  He said the fashion industry, the drama or entertainment industry... And sports.
[02:49:21.553 --> 02:49:26.575]  And sports is a big part, because the people emulate what they see the actors doing.
[02:49:26.795 --> 02:49:28.776]  Let's jam in one more call before I've got to break and come back.
[02:49:29.336 --> 02:49:30.796]  Let's talk to Stan in Ohio.
[02:49:30.816 --> 02:49:31.877]  You're on the air with Alan Watt.
[02:49:32.877 --> 02:49:33.457]  How's it going, guys?
[02:49:33.778 --> 02:49:33.998]  Good.
[02:49:35.838 --> 02:49:40.420]  I was wondering if I could get both your takes on Proposition 19 for California.
[02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:42.501]  You guys know about that one?
[02:49:43.041 --> 02:49:44.441]  Yes, but fill folks in briefly.
[02:49:44.461 --> 02:49:48.463]  Alright, yeah, that's the Legalization of Marijuana Act.
[02:49:50.855 --> 02:50:01.246]  I'm against the drug war because they launder the money, but now they're going to quasi-legalize certain drugs because they're unable to control the black market so they can tax it and control it.
[02:50:01.286 --> 02:50:01.747]  Alan, what?
[02:50:02.888 --> 02:50:06.211]  That's part of it, but now it's time as well to use all drugs.
[02:50:06.231 --> 02:50:12.838]  I mean, you've got half the population on psychoactive drugs or Valium types of tranquilizers anyway.
[02:50:13.596 --> 02:50:21.201]  So, they want the public to be very tranquil as we go through these massive changes, by any means possible, so they don't really care what you're taking.
[02:50:21.221 --> 02:50:24.663]  Yeah, that's why Soros is funding the legalization of marijuana.
[02:50:24.943 --> 02:50:26.844]  He isn't doing it to stop the police state.
[02:50:27.124 --> 02:50:29.105]  He's doing it because he wants you stoned out of your mind.
[02:50:29.125 --> 02:50:30.426]  Mm-hmm, but yeah.
[02:50:33.015 --> 02:50:38.357]  And I'm not bashing the whole weedhead community, but come on folks, you're not leading a charge up a hill when you've been smoking dope.
[02:50:39.278 --> 02:50:40.698]  Especially how strong it is now.
[02:50:41.159 --> 02:50:46.861]  Okay, we're going to come back and take a few final phone calls on the other side with Alan Watt, Guy, James, and Andrew.
[02:50:47.221 --> 02:50:49.842]  Stand by, we're coming back to you on the other side of this break.
[02:50:50.143 --> 02:50:53.884]  Don't forget the key jump points to join the rebellion against tyranny.
[02:50:54.264 --> 02:50:56.585]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:50:59.244 --> 02:51:07.228]  Gulf War vets, 9-11 workers, people around the Gulf oil spill fumes, all were exposed to toxic chemicals in the air and became ill.
[02:51:07.448 --> 02:51:09.930]  Even in your home, air contamination can make you sick.
[02:51:10.110 --> 02:51:17.374]  You have been exposed to airborne toxic particulate matter and volatile organic compounds causing fatigue, flu-like symptoms, or worse.
[02:51:17.554 --> 02:51:18.294]  Protect yourself.
[02:51:18.555 --> 02:51:20.656]  You cannot trust anyone to do it for you.

[02:52:59.264 --> 02:53:04.128]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:53:04.228 --> 02:53:05.008]  What have we got?
[02:53:05.208 --> 02:53:07.350]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:53:07.670 --> 02:53:08.411]  A republic.
[02:53:08.671 --> 02:53:11.253]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:53:11.333 --> 02:53:13.254]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:53:13.595 --> 02:53:15.496]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:53:15.616 --> 02:53:16.897]  So they think they own our land?
[02:53:17.297 --> 02:53:18.418]  They think they own our water?
[02:53:18.618 --> 02:53:19.019]  Children?
[02:53:19.219 --> 02:53:19.999]  Our education?
[02:53:20.340 --> 02:53:21.000]  Our money?
[02:53:21.160 --> 02:53:24.823]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:53:25.183 --> 02:53:28.848]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:53:28.888 --> 02:53:29.829]  You'll be warned.
[02:53:30.150 --> 02:53:30.991]  We have the facts.
[02:53:31.191 --> 02:53:32.292]  We have the Constitution.
[02:53:32.352 --> 02:53:33.234]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:53:33.254 --> 02:53:34.095]  We have common law.
[02:53:34.135 --> 02:53:36.398]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:36.678 --> 02:53:40.443]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:53:40.543 --> 02:53:45.324]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:53:45.504 --> 02:53:46.865]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:53:46.985 --> 02:53:47.825]  Don't tread on me.
[02:53:48.085 --> 02:53:54.947]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:54:12.619 --> 02:54:14.402]  We're almost out of time for this hour.
[02:54:14.442 --> 02:54:19.752]  Remember, we're here 24 hours a day at InfoWars.com and Alan Watts at CuttingToTheMatrix.com.
[02:54:20.834 --> 02:54:24.119]  We still may have time to turn the corner on this, but...
[02:54:25.401 --> 02:54:26.261]  They're murdering you.
[02:54:26.541 --> 02:54:27.261]  They're killing you.
[02:54:27.281 --> 02:54:28.422]  Cancer's off the charts.
[02:54:28.502 --> 02:54:29.122]  Infertility.
[02:54:29.182 --> 02:54:30.242]  They're bragging they're doing it.
[02:54:30.542 --> 02:54:31.682]  They're adding to the vaccines.
[02:54:31.722 --> 02:54:32.702]  I've got all their documents.
[02:54:32.742 --> 02:54:33.543]  I read them on air.
[02:54:33.943 --> 02:54:35.903]  Had links right to the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:54:36.683 --> 02:54:37.804]  They're not playing games.
[02:54:38.884 --> 02:54:41.044]  And people better grow up and realize you're under attack.
[02:54:41.084 --> 02:54:45.785]  If I walked up to your house and you opened the door and I punched you in the nose, even wimps would probably fight back.
[02:54:46.165 --> 02:54:48.906]  But they slowly creep up and kill you quiet and you love them.
[02:54:50.077 --> 02:54:52.818]  And I'm not talking to my general audience, but some of the new listeners out there.
[02:54:53.259 --> 02:54:55.560]  Look, we've been right about everything we've covered.
[02:54:55.860 --> 02:54:57.400]  Unfortunately, we're going to be right about the future.
[02:54:57.460 --> 02:54:58.821]  We have the globalist on blueprints.
[02:54:59.241 --> 02:55:00.582]  It's time to wake up, folks.
[02:55:00.602 --> 02:55:01.943]  You're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:55:02.883 --> 02:55:04.744]  Let's talk to Guy in New Jersey.
[02:55:04.764 --> 02:55:05.884]  You're on the air with Alan Watt.
[02:55:05.904 --> 02:55:06.645]  Quick question, please, sir.
[02:55:07.682 --> 02:55:09.704]  Alright, I have a quick thing I want to say.
[02:55:09.764 --> 02:55:13.768]  Everyone needs to go to Google right away and Google vending machines of the future.
[02:55:13.788 --> 02:55:22.196]  It just came out on Fox News that they installed 60 new vending machines all over the country that are going to have biometric scans on them for your thumbprint.
[02:55:22.276 --> 02:55:24.598]  They say after 2011 they're going to try and enforce it.
[02:55:25.679 --> 02:55:34.605]  You know, Watson wrote a story about this a month ago, dealing with the Mark of the Beast, and you have to thumbprint, face scan, swipe your license, and it's going to be for all purchases.
[02:55:34.865 --> 02:55:36.206]  They'll only be security guards.
[02:55:36.226 --> 02:55:37.266]  This is the official plan.
[02:55:37.807 --> 02:55:43.590]  In the shopping malls, in the grocery stores, the entire checkout container will be a scanner.
[02:55:43.691 --> 02:55:44.131]  Alan Watt.
[02:55:45.490 --> 02:55:50.973]  Yes, because the idea is that no one is supposed to escape this whole new system of surveillance.
[02:55:51.613 --> 02:55:58.156]  Eventually it will be impossible to go anywhere without your proper security card or even the chip.
[02:55:58.556 --> 02:55:59.657]  It's like a 1040.
[02:55:59.737 --> 02:56:03.518]  It's like a 1040 now for $600 things you buy with other businesses.
[02:56:03.538 --> 02:56:04.799]  You've got to report to the IRS.
[02:56:05.179 --> 02:56:10.702]  Now everything's going to have RFID and the whole history of that pair of shoes will be tracked.
[02:56:10.942 --> 02:56:11.362]  Go ahead, Alan.
[02:56:11.722 --> 02:56:16.805]  And not only that, they've talked about putting all your inoculation records on that chip.
[02:56:17.485 --> 02:56:25.629]  And one day you'll walk into a store and if you're not up to date with something, alarm bells will go off and the cops will grab you immediately and drag you off to the cell.
[02:56:25.649 --> 02:56:26.550]  Oh, that's already begun.
[02:56:26.590 --> 02:56:28.571]  I mean, they admit it's to track... Of course.
[02:56:29.420 --> 02:56:33.285]  Yeah, so this is a system, a complete system, that's what I mean by it.
[02:56:33.425 --> 02:56:34.867]  There's no choices in this system.
[02:56:35.208 --> 02:56:36.930]  It's either their way or no way.
[02:56:37.371 --> 02:56:40.715]  And they want to make sure that no one can survive outside their system.
[02:56:41.036 --> 02:56:43.879]  This war has been going on for thousands of years.
[02:56:46.803 --> 02:56:48.024]  And now it's coming to a head.
[02:56:48.104 --> 02:56:49.045]  Guy, great points.
[02:56:49.065 --> 02:56:49.826]  That was in my stack.
[02:56:49.846 --> 02:56:50.867]  I meant to get to it today.
[02:56:51.288 --> 02:56:52.449]  But here's an example.
[02:56:52.509 --> 02:56:54.892]  Nationwide, they had this 15 years ago.
[02:56:54.912 --> 02:56:56.153]  I had the CEO on.
[02:56:56.754 --> 02:56:59.977]  They've got face scanning cameras off your driver's license image they buy.
[02:57:00.678 --> 02:57:07.681]  At kiosks and malls and airports and on the street, and as you walk by it says, Alex Jones, we've got your size shoes here, you know, come in and get it.
[02:57:08.061 --> 02:57:09.922]  But that's only to pay for the surveillance.
[02:57:10.162 --> 02:57:18.666]  The real business of those companies is selling your whereabouts and your data, just like Target and Walmart and people, they're selling all that data.
[02:57:18.866 --> 02:57:22.388]  So they fund your enslavement with the system.
[02:57:22.408 --> 02:57:22.908]  Go ahead, Alan.
[02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:24.961]  That's right, too.
[02:57:25.381 --> 02:57:33.466]  It's such an easy trick to do, is to entice people into, this is free, that's free, just put up all your details here and use the system.
[02:57:34.006 --> 02:57:40.730]  We've had that with Facebook, the guy had it right from the beginning, he was going to sell the data, and all the idiots went and joined up for free.
[02:57:40.770 --> 02:57:42.891]  He called them idiots, a bunch of dumb effers!
[02:57:42.951 --> 02:57:44.592]  He did, he did, absolutely.
[02:57:44.892 --> 02:57:47.994]  But it won't stop them, because the next one will come out and join that.
[02:57:48.174 --> 02:57:51.839]  Oh no, they say it's a conspiracy theory that Facebook sells your data to the government.
[02:57:52.119 --> 02:57:55.684]  They attack us, Alan, even as he's calling them dumb scum.
[02:57:55.844 --> 02:57:58.067]  They're like, yes we are dumb scum, we love you.
[02:57:58.939 --> 02:58:01.220]  Yeah, because all their friends are on Facebook.
[02:58:01.240 --> 02:58:03.441]  You see, all their friends, you see?
[02:58:03.501 --> 02:58:07.303]  Once again, you're bursting their bubble, and so you will be attacked for doing so.
[02:58:07.523 --> 02:58:10.785]  And again, too, see, most folk today are in majority think.
[02:58:10.845 --> 02:58:13.366]  If the rest all think this way, then that's the way it must be.
[02:58:13.786 --> 02:58:17.348]  And everyone else is quite happy with it, so what's your problem?
