[00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:09.405]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:10.867]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.647 --> 00:00:12.568]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.892]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:21.455]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:36.132]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former editor of the Wall Street Journal, the father of Reaganomics, the head of Policy, Department of Treasury under Reagan, best-selling author, syndicated columnist, about a week and a half ago, wrote this article, Goodbye, Truth Has Fallen and Taken Liberty With It.
[00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.199]  And he said he'll do a few more interviews.
[00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:42.440]  In fact, he wants to come on Tax Day to talk about the slavery on the 15th.
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.121]  But then he's disengaging and fading off into the sunset.
[00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:51.702]  And we're honored to have him here with us today to talk about a host of issues.
[00:00:51.722 --> 00:00:56.283]  In fact, he's got a list of things he wants to talk about and why he is saying sayonara.
[00:00:56.303 --> 00:00:58.183]  And then we're going to get into Volcker.
[00:00:58.263 --> 00:01:02.864]  Carbon tax, VAT, should be on the table on top of the income tax.
[00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:06.826]  We'll be discussing that with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:01:06.886 --> 00:01:08.027]  Doc, good to have you here with us.
[00:01:08.387 --> 00:01:09.008]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:10.929]  Well, you've got the floor.
[00:01:11.089 --> 00:01:12.570]  I mean, why are you leaving?
[00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.851]  Why have you made this decision?
[00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:15.452]  We're going to walk through it.
[00:01:15.512 --> 00:01:26.060]  It says, remind Alex that he wants to ask me about 9-11, Murrah office bombing, Waco, Operation Northwoods, JFK, and we'll talk about the economy and the dying superpower.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.321]  So here you are, you've got the floor.
[00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:39.015]  You'd wanted me to explain why I was stopping the column, and basically a bunch of things just came together.
[00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:40.196]  One is, I'm just tired.
[00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:42.398]  I've been trying to save the country all my life.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:59.291]  The main thing is, though, I think I came to the conclusion that it's futile to write about what's happening, to write about the wars and the police state.
[00:02:00.595 --> 00:02:11.063]  The lack of our civil liberties, as long as the event that set those in motion itself can't be analyzed.
[00:02:11.083 --> 00:02:13.705]  And of course we're talking about 9-11.
[00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:26.816]  So, it dawned on me that sites on which I was sort of a favorite columnist, like antiwar.com, Counterpunch,
[00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:56.761]  Where I have the big following that neither side, for example, would let me even present facts or even present the evidence that the scientists who claimed to have found nanothermite in the residue of the World Trade Center tower, they wouldn't even let me
[00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:09.331]  Uh, report that there were a thousand architects and engineers who had sent a petition to Congress demanding an investigation.
[00:03:10.572 --> 00:03:20.877]  And so it made me realize that here were sites totally opposed to the war, totally opposed to the police state and the loss of our civil liberties.
[00:03:21.778 --> 00:03:27.221]  Sites who don't believe a word the government says about anything except 9-11.
[00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:32.541]  I got to thinking, well, what is the point of this?
[00:03:32.701 --> 00:03:41.406]  How can you oppose the government when you give it the grounds on which it's acting?
[00:03:42.247 --> 00:03:54.774]  So, I came to the conclusion that since 9-11, since it cannot be discussed, except, you know, in a few places like your site, and since people
[00:03:56.794 --> 00:04:07.458]  Believe that they were attacked by Muslims, and that we have to have police state powers to protect us from more attacks, that really nothing can be done.
[00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:12.320]  And so I said it's futile and pointless.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:23.885]  And then, about that time, I saw the latest poll that said 59% of the American people, that's three-fifths of the population,
[00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:35.359]  Are ready to go to war with Iran if they don't stop their peaceful nuclear energy program.
[00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:39.722]  And I got to thinking, well, how can people come to this conclusion?
[00:04:39.742 --> 00:04:45.887]  They've been lied to about weapons of mass destruction, LK, everything.
[00:04:46.228 --> 00:04:47.088]  Well, Doc, stay there.
[00:04:47.108 --> 00:04:47.689]  We got a break.
[00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:48.409]  We're going to come back.
[00:04:49.727 --> 00:04:52.832]  Discuss this fact that 99% of the time the government's lying.
[00:04:53.313 --> 00:04:55.376]  We know they're involved in every form of evil you can imagine.
[00:04:55.476 --> 00:04:59.562]  Northwoods, Gulf of Tonkin, and we'll be back.
[00:05:01.138 --> 00:05:03.738]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.100]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.200]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.341]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.521 --> 00:05:17.481]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:18.441]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:20.442]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.702 --> 00:05:21.542]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.782 --> 00:05:23.842]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.982 --> 00:05:25.103]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:25.323 --> 00:05:26.663]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.843 --> 00:05:27.483]  If there's a quarrel,
[00:05:27.483 --> 00:05:29.245]  You're in quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:05:29.405 --> 00:05:31.929]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:32.109 --> 00:05:35.333]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.714 --> 00:05:39.218]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:40.520]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.361]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.661 --> 00:05:42.583]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.763 --> 00:05:43.504]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.704 --> 00:05:44.085]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.765 --> 00:05:44.986]  I think.
[00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:01.517]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:01.557 --> 00:06:06.882]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:06:07.142 --> 00:06:11.767]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:06:12.167 --> 00:06:17.192]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:06:17.732 --> 00:06:22.414]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:06:22.955 --> 00:06:29.858]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:06:30.058 --> 00:06:30.979]  And here's the best part.
[00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:37.542]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:06:37.862 --> 00:06:40.703]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:41.043 --> 00:06:42.943]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:43.264 --> 00:06:44.104]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:06:44.124 --> 00:06:44.324]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:06:44.364 --> 00:06:47.345]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:06:47.845 --> 00:06:49.585]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:07:01.044 --> 00:07:08.350]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.853]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:07:13.074 --> 00:07:17.937]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[00:07:18.218 --> 00:07:25.403]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[00:07:25.703 --> 00:07:30.067]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:35.951]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:07:36.391 --> 00:07:42.935]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[00:07:52.001 --> 00:07:52.301]  269-409-1776 today!
[00:08:01.952 --> 00:08:04.153]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.173 --> 00:08:07.574]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.475 --> 00:08:13.156]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is with us.
[00:08:13.256 --> 00:08:14.796]  He just joined us for the rest of the hour.
[00:08:15.376 --> 00:08:20.978]  He's going to do this interview and then one on tax day with us and then bow out perhaps forever.
[00:08:20.998 --> 00:08:23.479]  He's not writing his column anymore.
[00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:25.440]  He's been writing two a week for a very long time.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.001]  Yeah, you know, it's an unbelievable story.
[00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:33.103]  In fact, you know, if you just look, anybody that looks at the World Trade Center towers for 15 seconds, you realize these are not buildings falling down.
[00:08:56.596 --> 00:08:58.918]  There's no sign of a building falling down.
[00:08:58.958 --> 00:08:59.638]  They're blowing up!
[00:09:00.719 --> 00:09:06.863]  And anybody that looks at it for 15 seconds should be able to see the difference between a building that's falling down and one that's blowing up.
[00:09:07.584 --> 00:09:10.906]  And so, Americans can't even use their own eyes.
[00:09:11.026 --> 00:09:11.847]  You see what I'm saying?
[00:09:12.567 --> 00:09:15.789]  And then we have this fantasy figure, Sheikh Mohammed.
[00:09:15.849 --> 00:09:21.273]  Now, you know, they said that bin Laden was responsible, but...
[00:09:23.004 --> 00:09:31.626]  Now, it's this Sheikh Mohammed, the guy they waterboarded 183 times until he finally confessed to being the mastermind of 9-11.
[00:09:31.646 --> 00:09:38.248]  Now, if you look at this, it makes no sense because look at this guy's feats.
[00:09:38.608 --> 00:09:41.729]  Sheikh Mohammed outwitted all 16 U.S.
[00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:45.110]  intelligence agencies along with those of all U.S.
[00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.311]  allies, including Israel's Mossad.
[00:09:48.294 --> 00:09:54.395]  So no intelligence service on Earth, nor all of them combined, was a match for Sheikh Mohammed.
[00:09:55.196 --> 00:10:01.017]  He outwitted the National Security Council, Dick Cheney, the Pentagon, State Department, NORAD, U.S.
[00:10:01.157 --> 00:10:02.958]  Air Force, Air Traffic Control.
[00:10:02.978 --> 00:10:07.319]  He caused airport security to fail four times in one morning.
[00:10:07.359 --> 00:10:10.739]  He caused state-of-the-art air defenses of the Pentagon to fail.
[00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:17.301]  He had people who couldn't fly planes pulling off fantastic
[00:10:17.836 --> 00:10:19.457]  We're good to go.
[00:10:47.757 --> 00:10:48.918]  See their own eyes.
[00:10:48.978 --> 00:10:54.682]  Now, what also happens when you try to raise these questions with people, even intelligent people?
[00:10:55.203 --> 00:10:57.644]  They say, oh, our government would never kill its own citizens.
[00:10:59.286 --> 00:10:59.706]  Oh, yeah?
[00:11:00.206 --> 00:11:01.087]  What about Waco?
[00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:03.409]  The Branch Davidians?
[00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:07.031]  There were 100 men, women, and children that the government murdered.
[00:11:07.992 --> 00:11:09.473]  No one was ever held accountable.
[00:11:11.335 --> 00:11:15.898]  But they say, oh, well, it was all the Branch Davidians' fault.
[00:11:16.804 --> 00:11:19.925]  But the government would never have a plot like 9-11.
[00:11:20.085 --> 00:11:22.106]  Well, what about Operation Northwood?
[00:11:23.367 --> 00:11:24.567]  Anybody can read about this.
[00:11:24.627 --> 00:11:31.050]  This was a plan designed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Lyman Lemitzer.
[00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:38.313]  It was released by the Warren Commission after the Kennedy report.
[00:11:39.208 --> 00:11:46.953]  It's available online, it's available in the National Security Archives, you can read about it on Wikipedia, it's everywhere.
[00:11:47.533 --> 00:12:05.924]  Here was an official plot by the United States military and various black ops groups in the government to gun down American citizens in Miami, in Washington, D.C., to blow up
[00:12:07.222 --> 00:12:17.226]  Boats of Cuban refugees to fabricate crashed airliners and to blame it all on Castro so they could invade Cuba.
[00:12:18.847 --> 00:12:23.829]  This is a known thing that we were prepared to do.
[00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:26.791]  And this was, you know, like 60 or more.
[00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:34.334]  This was what, 40, 50 years ago when we allegedly were still somewhat of a
[00:12:35.566 --> 00:12:37.327]  of a freedom and democracy country.
[00:12:37.907 --> 00:12:39.248]  And they were willing to do that then.
[00:12:39.328 --> 00:12:42.469]  And Kennedy, of course, fired LaMette, sir.
[00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.591]  And a lot of people believe that's why Kennedy was assassinated.
[00:12:47.572 --> 00:12:58.677]  And then we have this very curious Murrah office building bombing, the Oklahoma City bombing, that was penned on McVeigh with this drug fertilizer bomb.
[00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:02.619]  Well, General Parton
[00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:05.687]  It was head of Air Force Munitions.
[00:13:06.708 --> 00:13:11.672]  Spent his life developing, testing explosives for the Air Force.
[00:13:14.114 --> 00:13:22.040]  He put out a very thick report in which he said that that building was blown up from the inside out.
[00:13:23.482 --> 00:13:26.644]  And it most certainly was not blown up by a truck bomb.
[00:13:26.744 --> 00:13:31.268]  A truck bomb of that sort, 60 feet away, couldn't possibly
[00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:43.236]  Have done the damage and produced the outward explosions and the structural damage to those reinforced concrete columns.
[00:13:43.256 --> 00:13:49.660]  So, he was a real expert who put it on the line.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.020]  It had no impact whatsoever.
[00:13:53.682 --> 00:13:55.843]  He sent it to the Congress.
[00:13:55.883 --> 00:13:57.584]  He tried to talk to them.
[00:13:57.684 --> 00:13:59.405]  It was just all deep-sixed.
[00:14:02.028 --> 00:14:11.311]  So, what you have is a situation where it's impossible for experts, even, to bring facts.
[00:14:12.571 --> 00:14:20.474]  Not just to the public's attention, but to the attention of people in government who are supposed to be overseeing the government, such as the various congressional committees.
[00:14:22.434 --> 00:14:25.395]  So when you have that type of a situation, you know what?
[00:14:26.536 --> 00:14:28.256]  What has become of truth?
[00:14:29.056 --> 00:14:30.737]  It simply disappeared.
[00:14:34.254 --> 00:14:40.578]  It can't even get into the arena where various material interests operate.
[00:14:41.999 --> 00:14:47.042]  And so, you have to ask yourself, what are these columns for?
[00:14:48.643 --> 00:14:50.904]  The people fall for anything.
[00:14:50.944 --> 00:15:00.650]  The most absurd explanations and fantasies they accept as if they were actually real, and yet they're completely deaf.
[00:15:01.786 --> 00:15:06.733]  The experts, the facts, and so you can't help them.
[00:15:06.853 --> 00:15:11.380]  And so that's really the main reason I quit doing the column.
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.585]  I just came to the conclusion it was futile.
[00:15:16.467 --> 00:15:18.310]  The people are just so gullible.
[00:15:19.107 --> 00:15:21.428]  Well, Doctor, let me throw something in here.
[00:15:21.548 --> 00:15:23.068]  I mean, we don't need to lose all hope.
[00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:26.149]  It did take time to expose Oklahoma City.
[00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.410]  Columns further back were blown off with blast points.
[00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:33.732]  Then columns right up beside the truck, bomb that weren't even damaged.
[00:15:34.072 --> 00:15:35.092]  Parton pointed that out.
[00:15:35.132 --> 00:15:37.693]  The local news showed them removing the bombs.
[00:15:37.733 --> 00:15:39.934]  The governor said there were unexploded bombs inside.
[00:15:40.274 --> 00:15:42.635]  The BATF showed up and told medical workers
[00:15:42.995 --> 00:15:48.061]  Patch us up like we were here, minutes after it happened, lying, saying they were on the 9th floor.
[00:15:48.601 --> 00:15:52.806]  Terrence Yakey, a local police officer that was a hero, carried people out, said it was all staged.
[00:15:53.167 --> 00:15:54.368]  They murdered and tortured him.
[00:15:54.408 --> 00:15:57.351]  Going back to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, backing you up there.
[00:15:57.972 --> 00:16:12.259]  He confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built till four years after he was incarcerated, and even the 100-plus water boardings wouldn't make him lie and say he ran 9-11, so then they threatened to do stuff to his family, and that's mainstream news.
[00:16:12.559 --> 00:16:18.041]  So finally, for his children, he confessed to it, but it's a process, and it was 5%
[00:16:19.776 --> 00:16:31.906]  One, the Revolutionary War or less, and just because they do have a large portion of the public, like Congressman Johnson from Georgia who believes that islands float, and that they're going to capsize if there's too many people on them.
[00:16:31.926 --> 00:16:35.189]  That's, I mean, you know, a lot of dumbed-down people out there, even in government.
[00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:44.136]  It doesn't matter because your work and others' work is really woken a lot of people up, and I see a giant awakening happening, and I don't blame you for quitting it twice a week.
[00:16:45.458 --> 00:16:49.922]  Twice a week column, but I think that you've got a fighting spirit.
[00:16:49.962 --> 00:17:00.851]  You should take some time off, but I believe that you're going to be back and that you're not going to be able to control yourself, even though you're 71 years old, because you have liberty and love of the truth beating in your breast.
[00:17:00.911 --> 00:17:02.333]  And, you know, we can't give up.
[00:17:02.413 --> 00:17:06.496]  We know things will be much worse if we weren't here speaking out today.
[00:17:06.636 --> 00:17:13.102]  So I want to commend you for all your work, and I'm sorry that you were getting censored, but we'll continue going through the points you wanted to make.
[00:17:13.971 --> 00:17:19.355]  Well, you know, Alex, you say it's public knowledge.
[00:17:19.435 --> 00:17:22.077]  I mean, it's available to the public.
[00:17:22.378 --> 00:17:23.739]  They could know it, but they don't.
[00:17:23.899 --> 00:17:26.080]  I mean, you know it, I know it, a few others know it.
[00:17:27.061 --> 00:17:31.245]  And the people that they call kooks, the 9-11 skeptics.
[00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.489]  It's public knowledge only in the sense that it's available.
[00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.332]  The public doesn't know it and doesn't want to know it.
[00:17:40.432 --> 00:17:41.513]  And if you try to tell them, they go,
[00:17:42.298 --> 00:17:43.578]  Well, Doctor, let me stop you again.
[00:17:44.238 --> 00:17:47.379]  You use a poll of 57% wanting to attack Iran.
[00:17:47.919 --> 00:17:50.620]  They have select demographics they can call.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.201]  I've commissioned polls before, and I know you know about polls.
[00:17:54.221 --> 00:17:59.282]  I've been in government and media a lot longer than I have been in the media.
[00:17:59.622 --> 00:18:06.104]  I mean, we've got an Angus and Reed New York Times poll from 2006 with 84% believing we've been lied to about 9-11.
[00:18:07.184 --> 00:18:10.925]  And so, I don't trust some of these polls we're seeing.
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:12.520]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.961]  Polls could actually never even occur.
[00:18:15.001 --> 00:18:23.664]  I mean, I could see the CIA or some government agency, the Pentagon, goes to a pollster and say, here's a bunch of money.
[00:18:23.724 --> 00:18:24.645]  Give us this result.
[00:18:24.665 --> 00:18:25.445]  Here's the result we want.
[00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:27.586]  And that's entirely possible.
[00:18:27.646 --> 00:18:32.768]  I mean, as I said in my sign-off article, money has replaced everything.
[00:18:33.808 --> 00:18:37.209]  And people will do anything for money, lie, cheat, steal.
[00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.310]  And they do all the time.
[00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.131]  And so you're completely right.
[00:18:42.692 --> 00:18:45.194]  But let's assume that people do know.
[00:18:47.555 --> 00:18:49.195]  They still do nothing about it.
[00:18:49.235 --> 00:18:51.176]  They've got no way of doing anything about it.
[00:18:52.077 --> 00:18:56.138]  The government doesn't represent them, doesn't listen to them.
[00:18:58.259 --> 00:19:00.020]  In every sense, they become irrelevant.
[00:19:00.821 --> 00:19:08.744]  The government represents the powerful moneyed interest groups that finance the political campaigns.
[00:19:12.123 --> 00:19:27.027]  The people are really, even if we had them all educated and aware, which I don't think we do, still, there's nothing short of arming themselves and rebellion.
[00:19:28.127 --> 00:19:32.748]  There's no way they can impact or influence the government because it's paying attention to them.
[00:19:32.768 --> 00:19:37.649]  It could care less about the people, what's happening to them, or what they think.
[00:19:38.049 --> 00:19:40.090]  So, it is a pretty bad
[00:19:43.209 --> 00:19:43.729]  Stay there.
[00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:46.631]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us today.
[00:19:46.671 --> 00:19:52.874]  We're going to continue going over his swan song final article that he wrote a week and a half ago.
[00:19:52.894 --> 00:19:58.877]  And I've got a lot of other points I want to bring up with him as a top economist on all these new taxes they're announcing.
[00:19:58.897 --> 00:19:59.558]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.365 --> 00:20:05.628]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:22:00.948 --> 00:22:07.170]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:15.392]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.732 --> 00:22:23.574]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:23.914 --> 00:22:28.657]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.998 --> 00:22:33.741]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:34.221 --> 00:22:38.084]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[00:23:29.807 --> 00:23:30.868]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:23:31.048 --> 00:23:35.431]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:23:35.591 --> 00:23:41.315]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:23:41.415 --> 00:23:44.837]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:23:45.057 --> 00:23:47.659]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:24:06.202 --> 00:24:08.006]  That's right, the awakening has begun.
[00:24:08.026 --> 00:24:09.269]  The enemy is afraid.
[00:24:11.069 --> 00:24:15.531]  We're going to win this thing, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the work of people like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:24:16.171 --> 00:24:25.636]  The fundamental situation we face is a decadent, entertainment-drunk culture who don't see themselves in the role of being informed or involved.
[00:24:26.296 --> 00:24:30.138]  Our numbers are much greater than many know, because I'm here every day, I see the numbers.
[00:24:30.998 --> 00:24:32.639]  And I see the trend going up.
[00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:38.411]  The scientific dictatorship has set up Homeland Security and NORTHCOM.
[00:24:38.431 --> 00:24:43.575]  They want to push the American people into violent resistance so they can bring in a full tyranny.
[00:24:45.036 --> 00:24:46.137]  We must resist.
[00:24:46.197 --> 00:24:47.078]  We must speak out.
[00:24:47.138 --> 00:24:48.539]  We must deprogram people.
[00:24:49.519 --> 00:24:57.525]  And that's what we attempt to do here each and every day, but they say there's a sign as you enter hell, all those that enter here give up hope.
[00:24:58.025 --> 00:25:03.729]  Well, we haven't reached hell yet, but we have Dr. Roberts being censored in his
[00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:04.850]  Yeah.
[00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:05.110]  We are.
[00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:05.750]  We are in dire straits.
[00:25:31.983 --> 00:25:34.004]  I still think that people are not aware of it.
[00:25:34.024 --> 00:25:34.845]  They're insouciant.
[00:25:36.406 --> 00:25:50.315]  And look, think about the, uh, we covered, uh, you know, the, uh, you know, the McVeigh, Oklahoma City bombing, 9-11, Operation Northwards, but just think about the Kennedy assassination.
[00:25:50.355 --> 00:25:54.738]  I think when, when the black ops groups got away with that, that's what kind of sealed our fate.
[00:25:55.459 --> 00:26:00.062]  And the liberals let them get away with it because with
[00:26:00.868 --> 00:26:08.372]  With the election of Kennedy, you see, the liberals had overcome the Eisenhower Republicans.
[00:26:09.153 --> 00:26:11.734]  And we're now going to use the government to do great things.
[00:26:13.075 --> 00:26:20.359]  We're going to use the government to do great things for the American people and remake society and make it more fair and just and all of this.
[00:26:20.419 --> 00:26:26.583]  So they couldn't possibly let it out that the government had killed the President.
[00:26:28.601 --> 00:26:47.471]  So they concocted another fantasy story about how Oswald, with a worthless rifle, shot Kennedy from behind and killed him with a magic bullet that also wounded Connolly and did all kinds of improbable things.
[00:26:48.171 --> 00:26:56.015]  And yet, all the evidence is that Kennedy was hit from the right front, hit at the right front temple, blew out the back of his head.
[00:26:56.075 --> 00:26:56.876]  You can see that.
[00:26:57.708 --> 00:26:59.209]  In the films that tourists took.
[00:27:00.369 --> 00:27:08.572]  And you can see Jackie, his wife, crawling out on the trunk of the limo to recover the back part of his skull that you've just seen blown out from the front.
[00:27:10.033 --> 00:27:11.853]  You know, the bullet hitting the front, blowing out.
[00:27:11.913 --> 00:27:14.834]  All these things are available.
[00:27:14.954 --> 00:27:25.879]  And then they get this Patchy Oswald, and before he can ever be questioned, Jack Ruby is somehow with a gun inside a jail where he doesn't belong.
[00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:26.939]  He has no right to be
[00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.772]  Inside the jail, much less with a gun, and he shoots Oswald inside the jail.
[00:27:33.873 --> 00:27:44.777]  And yet people still fall for the Warren Commission report, which has been disproved over and over and over and over by expert after expert after expert.
[00:27:46.518 --> 00:27:57.203]  And yet, we still have this sort of mythology of Oswald killed Kennedy, and then even after
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.341]  All the evidence finally forced the Congressional Committee to look at it again.
[00:28:03.441 --> 00:28:10.182]  And you had all these witnesses who saw a gunman at the Grassy Knoll shoot.
[00:28:12.123 --> 00:28:14.483]  And so what do they do, finally?
[00:28:14.543 --> 00:28:21.245]  Well, Congress issues the report, well, there was a second gunman.
[00:28:22.085 --> 00:28:22.945]  Another loner.
[00:28:23.265 --> 00:28:25.286]  Another deranged loner.
[00:28:26.706 --> 00:28:27.326]  So we have
[00:28:27.861 --> 00:28:36.343]  Two deranged loaners, operating independently of one another, both decided to shoot Kennedy on the same day, same place.
[00:28:36.403 --> 00:28:39.024]  Now, how can anybody believe these things?
[00:28:40.164 --> 00:28:40.924]  And yet they do.
[00:28:41.365 --> 00:28:48.046]  And you're talking about the 79 report, where they said a 98% chance that it was a conspiracy.
[00:28:50.187 --> 00:28:54.228]  Well, you know, they kind of... the conspiracy...
[00:28:55.557 --> 00:29:08.423]  Well, maybe I don't remember it exactly right, but I thought the conspiracy kind of disappeared by the final conclusion that it was a second alone government.
[00:29:08.443 --> 00:29:09.704]  Yeah, they inserted that in there.
[00:29:09.984 --> 00:29:11.384]  Yeah, somebody did.
[00:29:12.585 --> 00:29:18.788]  So, basically the government seems to be able to do whatever it wants.
[00:29:20.108 --> 00:29:21.149]  I can't say the government.
[00:29:23.351 --> 00:29:27.694]  There's some parts of the government.
[00:29:27.714 --> 00:29:31.616]  The secret team that Fletcher Prouty talked about, the former head of Black Ops at the Pentagon.
[00:29:31.977 --> 00:29:32.457]  Stay there.
[00:29:32.557 --> 00:29:33.557]  Long segment coming up.
[00:29:33.577 --> 00:29:35.038]  We're going to finish up with Kennedy.
[00:29:35.078 --> 00:29:39.141]  Let's get into some other subjects and talk about the economy.
[00:29:40.001 --> 00:29:47.906]  Fresh off their takeover of health care and all the other tax increases, they say they're going to ram through the carbon taxes and a value added and a sales tax.
[00:29:48.826 --> 00:29:49.367]  It's incredible.
[00:29:51.058 --> 00:29:54.042]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.984 --> 00:29:57.648]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.301 --> 00:30:05.922]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:06.262 --> 00:30:14.384]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:30:15.124 --> 00:30:19.145]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:30:19.745 --> 00:30:30.567]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:30:31.187 --> 00:30:40.190]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:45.732]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:30:46.132 --> 00:30:53.315]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:53.615 --> 00:30:56.036]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.283]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:31:04.443 --> 00:31:05.344]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:05.705 --> 00:31:09.268]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:09.288 --> 00:31:11.850]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:17.315]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:31:17.735 --> 00:31:23.961]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:24.401 --> 00:31:29.943]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:30.343 --> 00:31:34.044]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:31:34.564 --> 00:31:38.565]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:38.825 --> 00:31:44.327]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:44.787 --> 00:31:47.768]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:48.328 --> 00:31:49.749]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:50.309 --> 00:31:50.749]  It's here.

[00:32:07.194 --> 00:32:11.956]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:32:12.316 --> 00:32:18.598]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:32:21.052 --> 00:32:27.283]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[00:32:29.554 --> 00:32:33.436]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:32:34.137 --> 00:32:37.338]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[00:32:37.959 --> 00:32:38.799]  Others don't.
[00:32:39.199 --> 00:32:41.100]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.861]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:32:43.141 --> 00:32:45.703]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:32:46.023 --> 00:32:52.266]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:32:52.647 --> 00:32:54.848]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:32:55.348 --> 00:32:57.369]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[00:32:57.729 --> 00:32:58.590]  Others don't.
[00:33:05.299 --> 00:33:14.147]  In our trailer for Invisible Empire, trailer two, up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, we have a clip of Obama a few months ago at the UN.
[00:33:14.847 --> 00:33:19.131]  And he said, no new world order can have one nation above another.
[00:33:19.171 --> 00:33:21.834]  And people thought, oh, that means have equality.
[00:33:21.894 --> 00:33:24.496]  No, that means lower all of us to third world standing.
[00:33:24.816 --> 00:33:26.498]  And that's what Bill Gates, Ted Turner, the UN,
[00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:35.181]  This is the ultra-rich mafia, basically, coming in and taking over society through environmental taxes, through all of it.
[00:33:35.201 --> 00:33:36.762]  And we have the father of Reaganomics.
[00:33:37.242 --> 00:33:42.204]  We have a gentleman listed by Forbes and many other publications as one of the top ten living economists.
[00:33:43.344 --> 00:33:49.066]  And I was talking to him about Kennedy cutting taxes between 50 and 30 percent, depending on which tax it was.
[00:33:49.086 --> 00:33:50.546]  And he said, basically, that's correct.
[00:33:50.886 --> 00:33:52.327]  And more money came in.
[00:33:52.727 --> 00:33:53.587]  The government knows this.
[00:33:53.607 --> 00:33:56.128]  You cut taxes, the economy starts racing.
[00:33:56.568 --> 00:33:58.928]  But it's the free market, Main Street economy.
[00:33:59.609 --> 00:34:01.829]  And the big central banks don't want that.
[00:34:01.849 --> 00:34:04.150]  They want a controlled, vertically integrated economy.
[00:34:05.417 --> 00:34:06.838]  And they want to impoverish people.
[00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:12.782]  It's the third world rule, where you have more billionaires in Mexico than we have here in the U.S., but one of the poorest populations in the world.
[00:34:13.402 --> 00:34:22.747]  So I want to encourage everyone to understand what's happening, and it's all covered in the new film that premieres in just, what, about six, seven days on the 15th.
[00:34:24.105 --> 00:34:26.486]  At PrisonPlanet.tv, you can pre-order the DVD now.
[00:34:26.506 --> 00:34:28.546]  We're going to be shipping them out starting next week.
[00:34:28.586 --> 00:34:29.307]  You'll get them first.
[00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:40.090]  Those that pre-order, Invisible Empire, a new world order defined in their own words, open admission of global government, open admission of eugenics, government money laundering, drug dealing.
[00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:43.031]  It's all covered in Invisible Empire, a new world order defined.
[00:34:43.111 --> 00:34:51.914]  And then, a week later, we released Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, proving the FEMA camps, proving false flag terror, proving the underwear bombing was a staged event.
[00:34:53.234 --> 00:34:54.515]  Covering executive orders.
[00:34:54.896 --> 00:34:55.356]  Everything.
[00:34:55.416 --> 00:34:56.137]  Two new films.
[00:34:56.157 --> 00:34:58.679]  You can order them now in the month of April.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:06.146]  Infowars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:35:06.166 --> 00:35:06.566]  888-253-3139.
[00:35:07.147 --> 00:35:11.691]  Or you can watch them both online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:12.171 --> 00:35:13.753]  All right, going back to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:35:13.773 --> 00:35:15.735]  We've been having very interesting discussions behind the scenes.
[00:35:15.775 --> 00:35:17.656]  I want to get into the economy, but first going back
[00:35:18.477 --> 00:35:19.497]  To violent revolution.
[00:35:19.918 --> 00:35:33.602]  They've now framed that even if you defend yourself when CPS without due process is snatching your kid, DynCorp runs many of the systems in the states, convicted white slavery traffickers, that's Chicago Tribune AP.
[00:35:33.762 --> 00:35:35.983]  If you resist them taking your farm, you're a terrorist.
[00:35:36.343 --> 00:35:38.423]  They clearly have set up this system.
[00:35:38.783 --> 00:35:43.645]  Now we have the Homeland Security internal documents where they admit Homeland Security is set up for the American people.
[00:35:44.805 --> 00:35:46.345]  So, I mean, where do you see this going?
[00:35:46.405 --> 00:35:48.846]  Because they're not going to implement any real reforms.
[00:35:49.186 --> 00:35:50.826]  This is by design, in my opinion.
[00:35:50.846 --> 00:35:52.226]  I mean, where is it going?
[00:35:53.507 --> 00:35:55.707]  Well, it's the police state.
[00:35:57.147 --> 00:36:02.168]  That's been obvious since the, you know, like the second year of the Bush administration, where we used to talk about it.
[00:36:02.208 --> 00:36:06.049]  If you'll remember, you and I, when you were doing interviews.
[00:36:07.549 --> 00:36:08.269]  Where is it going?
[00:36:12.603 --> 00:36:14.764]  The local police now are militarized.
[00:36:17.085 --> 00:36:20.626]  If you go to a gun club, all the police will be there.
[00:36:20.646 --> 00:36:21.827]  They've got automatic weapons.
[00:36:21.967 --> 00:36:27.729]  There'll be 20, 30, 40, 50 of them, and they're practicing mass fire.
[00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:29.710]  What's it all about?
[00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:34.992]  It's for controlling the people who pay their salaries.
[00:36:35.532 --> 00:36:38.674]  So the whole thing is set up.
[00:36:40.773 --> 00:36:44.997]  To prevent any kind of opposition from the population.
[00:36:45.858 --> 00:36:50.962]  And it's like you say, they can now declare anybody to be a terrorist.
[00:36:52.423 --> 00:36:59.529]  And therefore, they can confiscate not just your life and rights, but all your assets.
[00:37:00.089 --> 00:37:02.171]  So, it's a police state.
[00:37:02.211 --> 00:37:04.252]  People are not aware of this.
[00:37:05.553 --> 00:37:09.577]  They still think the government is there to protect them in some way.
[00:37:11.253 --> 00:37:17.536]  I get a lot of emails from people who are already suffering these types of intrusions.
[00:37:18.577 --> 00:37:24.459]  They've read my book about how the law has been destroyed, and they want to know what they can do.
[00:37:24.479 --> 00:37:31.622]  Of course, they haven't got any rights, so they can't do anything.
[00:37:31.662 --> 00:37:37.005]  I don't know how much of it is a plan with a direct
[00:37:37.819 --> 00:37:42.102]  Goal in mind or how much of it is just the police agencies grabbing power.
[00:37:43.423 --> 00:37:52.169]  And of course, it doesn't much matter because under either system, we've lost our rights.
[00:37:52.710 --> 00:38:06.700]  And it's very hard for people, even if they're organized and have weapons, to resist because the kinds of weapons the police and the military have, I mean, you know, they have
[00:38:12.162 --> 00:38:27.313]  And now under NORTHCOM, we have the military everywhere conditioning the public at DWI checkpoints, at the Kentucky Derby, at football games, searching children, running checkpoints on the highways, an armed camp drilling and training to go after us.
[00:38:28.494 --> 00:38:31.917]  I want to cover one other issue before we get into the economy, Dr. Roberts.
[00:38:32.637 --> 00:38:38.279]  Have you seen the gun camera footage from three years ago in Iraq that WikiLeaks released a few days ago?
[00:38:38.319 --> 00:38:48.864]  They said they've got scores of these videos they're going to be releasing where they are killing the people and shooting the kids in the minivan trying to get a wounded reporter
[00:38:49.424 --> 00:38:55.606]  Off the street, and secondarily, I get these emails, it's a minority of the emails, saying, how dare you criticize our troops?
[00:38:55.946 --> 00:38:56.746]  This is a war.
[00:38:57.146 --> 00:39:00.347]  Well, yeah, this is a war that was built on lies and WMDs.
[00:39:00.647 --> 00:39:14.970]  We go invade the country, we kill over a million of them, and then there's this droning, brainwashed message that we've got to support the troops by keeping them in 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 tours, and treating them like garbage when they get back.
[00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:18.271]  And it's just this mindless supposed patriotism
[00:39:18.911 --> 00:39:19.991]  To worship tyranny.
[00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:22.752]  It's very reminiscent of what happened to Nazi Germany.
[00:39:23.012 --> 00:39:23.732]  Yes, that's right.
[00:39:23.752 --> 00:39:25.033]  You know, they're brown shirts.
[00:39:25.093 --> 00:39:27.533]  I've been calling them brown shirts for years.
[00:39:28.454 --> 00:39:30.854]  You've described it accurately.
[00:39:31.715 --> 00:39:33.855]  That's exactly the situation.
[00:39:35.816 --> 00:39:41.537]  It's another reason that I thought writing for these people is pointless.
[00:39:41.657 --> 00:39:47.539]  I mean, they can't phantom the danger that they're in.
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.622]  Many of them, of course, are still fighting the Vietnam War.
[00:39:52.503 --> 00:39:56.605]  They're still angry that we didn't win the war, but suppose we had won it, what would be any different?
[00:39:58.627 --> 00:40:04.070]  The whole thing is some form of emotional infantilism.
[00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:13.496]  They're people who are still three years old, and they're ruled by some sort of blind emotions.
[00:40:13.536 --> 00:40:15.017]  They're incapable of thought.
[00:40:16.278 --> 00:40:17.539]  They can't even take in facts.
[00:40:18.928 --> 00:40:23.130]  So talking to them is a waste of time.
[00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:44.621]  Once you get into one big lie, then it's a bigger lie, a bigger lie, and then things accelerate at the end.
[00:40:45.041 --> 00:40:54.824]  And do you agree that we're now reaching that acceleration point where all of this preparatory slide into tyranny and corruption has seemed fast, but we ain't seen nothing yet?
[00:40:55.484 --> 00:40:56.464]  Yes, that's true.
[00:40:56.544 --> 00:41:04.646]  And if you look at the complicity of the federal courts, even the Supreme Court, I mean, how quiet they've been and tolerant of this.
[00:41:04.967 --> 00:41:06.147]  And the law schools.
[00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:13.413]  And the law deans, and the bar associations, and the law firms, wherever you look, it's just acceptance.
[00:41:14.833 --> 00:41:17.934]  There's essentially acceptance of this.
[00:41:19.055 --> 00:41:24.937]  You would have thought that all the prestigious law schools would be on their high horse, the bar associations.
[00:41:25.138 --> 00:41:27.559]  People would be screaming, what are you doing?
[00:41:27.579 --> 00:41:31.140]  You can't destroy civil liberties on the basis of a hoax.
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.402]  But that's exactly what's happening, and people are accepting it.
[00:41:36.641 --> 00:41:39.262]  Try to find some way to make money out of it, you know?
[00:41:40.263 --> 00:42:02.634]  Well, the point I make is all these people that dehumanize Iraqis or Afghans or others or the Serbs or the South Ossetians, they have to understand that 100% of the time in history, when you get sucked in by an imperial spirit of evil, and it's like a team spirit,
[00:42:03.772 --> 00:42:07.096]  Once you do that, it's always visited on you.
[00:42:07.576 --> 00:42:08.777]  It always comes back.
[00:42:08.857 --> 00:42:16.185]  The system has a desire and they will carry it out on all of these people that have gone along with it.
[00:42:16.285 --> 00:42:17.526]  Exactly.
[00:42:17.787 --> 00:42:20.169]  Well look, what happened to Hitler's brown shirts?
[00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:24.814]  First thing he did when he had real power was turn on the brown shirts and destroy them.
[00:42:26.195 --> 00:42:27.555]  They were all killed, arrested.
[00:42:27.936 --> 00:42:28.676]  Don't you remember that?
[00:42:28.796 --> 00:42:45.642]  I mean, this is one of the key things in the Nazi history, that the brown shirts that marched through the streets for Hitler and, you know, attacked all the Jews, the Kristallnacht, all of that stuff, all of this violent crowd, the first thing Hitler did was to eliminate them.
[00:42:46.622 --> 00:42:47.723]  So you're exactly right.
[00:42:48.963 --> 00:42:50.223]  That's exactly what happens.
[00:42:51.184 --> 00:42:52.404]  Well, that's what Stalin did.
[00:42:52.484 --> 00:42:54.265]  Look what Stalin did to the Bolsheviks.
[00:42:55.012 --> 00:42:57.554]  The Bolsheviks made the revolution, so you eliminate it.
[00:42:58.855 --> 00:43:00.396]  Because they know how to get things done.
[00:43:00.456 --> 00:43:01.697]  That's in their handbook.
[00:43:01.717 --> 00:43:03.798]  You know, people really don't know this, but it's a fact.
[00:43:04.399 --> 00:43:08.102]  Mao was basically put on house arrest the last few years of his life.
[00:43:08.522 --> 00:43:14.886]  His wife was arrested, and the Communists then scapegoated him, and he was certainly part of it, for all of their evil.
[00:43:14.926 --> 00:43:21.351]  So they come to full power and have giant purges, and they even flush the top people down the toilet.
[00:43:21.731 --> 00:43:22.112]  That's right.
[00:43:23.152 --> 00:43:23.893]  That's exactly...
[00:43:24.713 --> 00:43:25.553]  That's exactly that.
[00:43:25.653 --> 00:43:41.720]  Once it starts, it's... And then, of course, the police have to prove that they're on the government's side, and the way you do that, you're always producing new terrorists, or new enemies of the people, or, you know, the KGB and the Stalin, they used to have what they called street sweeps.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:46.061]  The officers would just go down the street and arrest everybody on the street.
[00:43:47.642 --> 00:43:49.443]  By the way, listen to the gulag.
[00:43:50.103 --> 00:44:09.187]  Wow, two weeks ago a bunch of articles came out at the same time about police admitting quotas and not just for parking tickets or speeding but to just arrest people and federal marshals have come out and said they're meant to put people on terror list for no reason in the airports and that there are quotas to create the perception that there are all these criminals.
[00:44:09.447 --> 00:44:10.728]  Right, that's exactly it.
[00:44:12.248 --> 00:44:15.929]  I mean, it's out of control, I think, as you emphasized.
[00:44:16.638 --> 00:44:17.499]  It's out of control.
[00:44:17.579 --> 00:44:22.863]  I don't know whether they have any kind of specific plan that they're implementing step-by-step.
[00:44:23.723 --> 00:44:25.384]  I don't think things happen that way.
[00:44:25.605 --> 00:44:32.690]  I think it's just people, bullies, people who want power, they see opportunities to get it, they grab it.
[00:44:33.356 --> 00:44:59.009]  Well, I agree with you, Doctor, but there's a National Law Enforcement Think Tank Council, and Arne Seveda takes blood without warrants, total police state, shuts down gun shows without any law, just thuggishly just does it under Fed control, and it turns out he was picked by the Feds from California, brought here, and is now the frontrunner for Dallas, and this secretive National Council is telling Dallas to hire him, and then if they do, federal funds come in.
[00:44:59.369 --> 00:44:59.589]  Yeah.
[00:45:00.289 --> 00:45:01.390]  Well, I'm not in the lead.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.761]  I'm not the least surprised.
[00:45:05.743 --> 00:45:07.904]  We're running out of time for the economy.
[00:45:07.944 --> 00:45:09.205]  You want to do anything on that?
[00:45:09.525 --> 00:45:10.866]  Absolutely, sir.
[00:45:11.347 --> 00:45:15.610]  In fact, let's get into the carbon tax, the value-added, where all this is going.
[00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:17.472]  Okay.
[00:45:17.992 --> 00:45:18.372]  You ready?
[00:45:18.753 --> 00:45:19.093]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:19.113 --> 00:45:20.394]  All right.
[00:45:21.315 --> 00:45:28.340]  They're coming up with these taxes because they have bankrupted the federal treasury and, of course, the states.
[00:45:31.272 --> 00:45:32.552]  is endangering the dollar.
[00:45:34.113 --> 00:45:37.273]  And if the dollar cracks, their power goes with it.
[00:45:37.293 --> 00:45:45.895]  I mean, what could really, what would stop the American empire in its tracks would be the failure of the dollar as reserve currency.
[00:45:46.735 --> 00:45:49.316]  Because that's what American power is based on.
[00:45:49.376 --> 00:45:50.856]  It's not based on anything else.
[00:45:50.936 --> 00:45:54.677]  It's based on the dollar as reserve currency.
[00:45:54.717 --> 00:45:57.878]  So their bank bailouts and
[00:45:58.857 --> 00:46:04.821]  Their wars have produced such massive deficits that they cannot be financed by world savings.
[00:46:06.462 --> 00:46:16.349]  And so, I mean, even if the other countries were still willing to buy the trade rebounds, there's just not enough world savings to finance the United States government's deficit.
[00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:24.095]  So they have the dollar in danger and their powers in danger, so they've got to find some new tax revenues.
[00:46:24.961 --> 00:46:29.604]  And so that's what the value-added tax is about, because it's like a sales tax.
[00:46:30.244 --> 00:46:32.465]  You can't avoid it except by not purchasing.
[00:46:34.206 --> 00:46:40.529]  And if you don't buy anything, then you don't have to pay that tax.
[00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:53.116]  Now, the carbon tax, in my opinion, is just another charade that the corporations came up with because it lets them buy and sell the right to pollute.
[00:46:54.397 --> 00:47:00.882]  So they can turn environmental damaging action, pollution, into a profit-making venture.
[00:47:02.003 --> 00:47:16.035]  So that's what the carbon tax does, and the corporations of course are all in favor of it because they can now buy it and sell it, and Wall Street wants it because they'll turn it into derivatives.
[00:47:17.036 --> 00:47:19.658]  You know, the right to pollute becomes valuable.
[00:47:20.799 --> 00:47:22.761]  And so that's
[00:47:23.939 --> 00:47:26.159]  That's what that's about.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.100]  So what happens?
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:40.282]  So here we have the American people, the middle class is essentially destroyed because there have been no new middle class jobs, no net new middle class jobs in a decade.
[00:47:41.402 --> 00:47:48.043]  So all the people who graduate college and have hopes and all that, there's nothing for them to do.
[00:47:49.843 --> 00:47:51.104]  Engineers can't find work.
[00:47:53.126 --> 00:47:55.388]  So they close us down.
[00:47:55.788 --> 00:48:04.215]  There's no growth in the income of the average American except for the 1% super-rich, whose income is growing phenomenally.
[00:48:05.276 --> 00:48:06.497]  So there's no income growth.
[00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:09.179]  People have lost their jobs.
[00:48:09.239 --> 00:48:11.781]  The real unemployment rate is around 22%.
[00:48:15.544 --> 00:48:22.570]  So you have all these people out of work, losing their homes, and now they want to make them pay a very added tax.
[00:48:24.372 --> 00:48:30.476]  So the effect of all this is to drive the people into the ground.
[00:48:32.017 --> 00:48:37.040]  It's the most destructive thing that you can do.
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.301]  You drive them into the ground.
[00:48:38.321 --> 00:48:40.442]  You make them more desperate.
[00:48:42.804 --> 00:48:47.687]  Right now, you know, there's still some fat in the system.
[00:48:49.068 --> 00:48:50.549]  Some parents still have money.
[00:48:50.629 --> 00:48:53.791]  The kids can come live at home even though they've got college degrees.
[00:48:55.123 --> 00:48:56.483]  But all of that drains away.
[00:48:57.923 --> 00:49:11.366]  And so, this is probably the first time in history where a government has intentionally destroyed its own population.
[00:49:12.586 --> 00:49:23.748]  The economic prospects of American people are being destroyed by the government that they elect, that they think represents them and has their
[00:49:24.684 --> 00:49:29.585]  This is a phenomenal development as well.
[00:49:31.546 --> 00:49:46.410]  It's just as extraordinary as the criminal actions of the government in creating terrorist events that then let it launch wars against the rest of the world.
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:50:01.666]  They have a term for it, command destruction, and it vertically integrates the economy, accelerates the power of the super-rich, but destroys the engine of wealth development.
[00:50:01.966 --> 00:50:16.613]  But when you look at Maurice Strong in 1992, and you look at what all these other environmentalists have said, and you look at the head of NASA Climatology, he says, it is our job, this is a credo, a maxim, to destroy the industrial society.
[00:50:18.815 --> 00:50:19.836]  This is feudalism.
[00:50:19.876 --> 00:50:21.536]  This is absolute despotism.
[00:50:23.037 --> 00:50:25.618]  Yes, I think that's true.
[00:50:26.058 --> 00:50:33.862]  The real question is, what can the United States government do about China and Russia?
[00:50:34.636 --> 00:50:36.357]  Let's talk about that when we come back, Doctor.
[00:50:36.438 --> 00:50:37.098]  Final segment.
[00:50:37.118 --> 00:50:41.942]  I'll see if I can twist your arm for another five because I realize this is one of our last interviews with you, at least for a long time.
[00:50:42.723 --> 00:50:44.144]  You said you wanted to come on on Tax Day.
[00:50:44.164 --> 00:50:45.065]  That was a great idea.
[00:50:45.085 --> 00:50:47.187]  So we'll look forward to seeing you next week.
[00:50:47.267 --> 00:50:49.228]  But we're going to come back.
[00:50:49.248 --> 00:50:52.051]  I'm going to try to give you the floor because you're talking about such important things.
[00:50:52.071 --> 00:50:53.092]  Your knowledge is so great.
[00:50:53.452 --> 00:50:58.576]  We'll also tell people about your newly published book if people want to learn more.
[00:50:58.656 --> 00:50:59.257]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:02.231]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.271 --> 00:51:07.616]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:07.856 --> 00:51:12.501]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:12.881 --> 00:51:13.281]  It's true.
[00:51:13.362 --> 00:51:17.926]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:51:18.446 --> 00:51:23.148]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:51:48.583 --> 00:51:50.325]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.361]  Great news for pure water lovers!

[00:53:06.242 --> 00:53:06.582]  Listen.
[00:53:06.942 --> 00:53:10.983]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:53:11.223 --> 00:53:14.164]  Two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[00:53:14.602 --> 00:53:17.425]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[00:53:17.645 --> 00:53:21.088]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.

[00:54:05.663 --> 00:54:08.105]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is our guest.
[00:54:08.145 --> 00:54:13.670]  Doc, before we get into China and the geopolitical breakdown, tell folks about your latest book.
[00:54:14.491 --> 00:54:17.013]  Well, it's how the economy was lost.
[00:54:17.213 --> 00:54:31.506]  It tells how the offshoring of jobs, for example, has prevented the growth of middle class jobs for over a decade and has suppressed the growth of American incomes.
[00:54:32.372 --> 00:54:39.077]  They've made the economy totally dependent on debt expansion, which has now, of course, ruined everyone because they can't pay their debts.
[00:54:39.117 --> 00:54:39.937]  They live in their homes.
[00:54:41.218 --> 00:54:52.547]  And it also then discusses the whole hoax of free trade, the free trade cloak for offshoring.
[00:54:54.448 --> 00:54:56.509]  Offshoring is not free trade.
[00:54:56.589 --> 00:54:57.710]  It's not any kind of trade.
[00:54:58.571 --> 00:54:59.612]  It's labor arbitrage.
[00:54:59.832 --> 00:55:01.293]  And I also discussed
[00:55:02.045 --> 00:55:21.978]  The failures are the most impressive failures in economic theory, in the games that economists play to hide the defects in their models that are helping us move along the road to economic Armageddon.
[00:55:21.998 --> 00:55:30.843]  It's all written in very accessible languages, no formulas, no arcane words, and essentially
[00:55:32.094 --> 00:55:44.138]  Well, Doc, in the time we've got left, geopolitically, with the different power blocks that are out there, you were getting into China.
[00:55:59.309 --> 00:56:02.630]  There's no doubt that the United States is on a hegemonic path.
[00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:04.450]  It wants to be the world hegemon.
[00:56:05.571 --> 00:56:18.674]  You know, you approach it various ways, the new world order, the planned world government and so forth, but there's no indication whatsoever that Russia or China is on this path or would go along with it.
[00:56:21.475 --> 00:56:27.497]  And so the question is, what does the United States government do about Russia and China?
[00:56:28.246 --> 00:56:35.309]  China, because they're clearly obstacles to American domination of the world.
[00:56:36.129 --> 00:56:44.673]  And now Russia is relatively weak, but it has the unlimited number of nuclear missiles that can blow us up many times over.
[00:56:45.993 --> 00:56:56.097]  And of course, the Chinese economy now is, in terms of industry, manufacturing, it greatly surpasses the United States economy.
[00:56:56.958 --> 00:56:57.678]  I mean, they're steel
[00:56:58.356 --> 00:57:02.058]  Production, for example, is many times ours.
[00:57:02.118 --> 00:57:06.600]  Their heavy equipment, their manufacturing, advanced technology.
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:14.623]  We're a second-rate economy compared to Chinese industry and manufacturing.
[00:57:14.643 --> 00:57:17.624]  So how can we shove them aside?
[00:57:17.664 --> 00:57:19.105]  Of course, they're also our biggest
[00:57:20.657 --> 00:57:21.958]  Well, we know how they plan that.
[00:57:22.358 --> 00:57:26.099]  Emergency in Kyrgyzstan as police fire on protesters.
[00:57:26.599 --> 00:57:29.280]  The CIA is admittedly in all the major stands.
[00:57:29.841 --> 00:57:30.861]  It's in Georgia.
[00:57:31.461 --> 00:57:36.163]  It's encircling China and financing rebels to attack these countries.
[00:57:36.183 --> 00:57:38.464]  And that's why the Communist Chinese are getting hopping mad.
[00:57:39.604 --> 00:57:40.905]  Well, you're right.
[00:57:40.965 --> 00:57:43.006]  That's what the CIA is doing.
[00:57:43.106 --> 00:57:48.728]  But the Russians and the Chinese, unlike the American people, are aware of it.
[00:57:50.382 --> 00:57:54.285]  And I don't think they'll sit there indefinitely, passively.
[00:57:55.406 --> 00:58:00.370]  And so something, they're likely to do something.
[00:58:00.671 --> 00:58:09.077]  And both of them have various powerful responses that they could make, I mean, short of a military attack.
[00:58:09.117 --> 00:58:13.221]  So the Russians can cut Europe off from natural gas.
[00:58:15.198 --> 00:58:24.871]  In fact, the Russians could punish severely these various stands that we're now operating in, the former constituent parts of the Soviet Union.
[00:58:26.233 --> 00:58:30.559]  The Chinese could certainly cause us a lot of financial worries.
[00:58:31.127 --> 00:58:31.928]  Doc, stay there.
[00:58:32.168 --> 00:58:32.488]  Stay there.
[00:58:32.508 --> 00:58:34.309]  We're coming right back after this quick break.
[00:58:34.850 --> 00:58:39.753]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, PresentPlanet.tv.
[00:58:40.834 --> 00:58:45.877]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:46.558 --> 00:58:49.760]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:51.158 --> 00:58:53.760]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:59.123]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:59.483 --> 00:59:01.224]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:01.544 --> 00:59:06.347]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:06.548 --> 00:59:07.508]  How much do you want?
[00:59:07.728 --> 00:59:08.469]  When do you want it?
[00:59:08.849 --> 00:59:10.430]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:11.551]  When will you need it?
[00:59:11.811 --> 00:59:13.872]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:14.012 --> 00:59:15.113]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:15.353 --> 00:59:16.654]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:16.874 --> 00:59:21.936]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:22.116 --> 00:59:25.298]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:25.718 --> 00:59:29.200]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:30.520]  How much will you need?
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:31.361]  We don't know.
[00:59:31.661 --> 00:59:32.561]  How much do you want?
[00:59:32.761 --> 00:59:33.502]  All you can get.
[00:59:33.682 --> 00:59:34.382]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:34.782 --> 00:59:37.544]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:37.824 --> 00:59:40.006]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:40.026 --> 00:59:41.006]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:41.026 --> 00:59:42.207]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:42.247 --> 00:59:44.068]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.191 --> 01:00:09.353]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.013 --> 01:00:10.833]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.594 --> 01:00:12.474]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.494 --> 01:00:16.796]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.336 --> 01:00:21.377]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.477 --> 01:00:26.700]  We'll cover the situation in Kyrgyzstan after Dr. Roberts leaves us here in about five minutes.
[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:30.221]  Got a bunch of other news we're gonna be going over and we're gonna open the phones up.
[01:00:31.212 --> 01:00:44.523]  But going back to Dr. Roberts, during the break I was making the point, you gotta say that on air, that normal people, like himself or myself, we like a bonfire and a pretty view, and our wife there, our kids there, a glass of beer.
[01:00:45.164 --> 01:00:49.327]  But psychopaths like Hitler, he would go to the front and watch burning buildings and war for hours.
[01:00:49.727 --> 01:00:51.669]  They love dead bodies, they love destruction.
[01:00:51.969 --> 01:00:59.816]  And we were talking about how it's now come out and been admitted that Cheney wanted to start nuclear war with Russia, I guess to stay in power or something, and that
[01:01:00.476 --> 01:01:00.816]  On 888.
[01:01:01.477 --> 01:01:04.238]  And that same group is still in control of Obama.
[01:01:04.258 --> 01:01:07.020]  I mean, we're dealing with real psychopaths.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:07.640]  Dr. Roberts?
[01:01:08.781 --> 01:01:10.002]  Yes, they're insane people.
[01:01:11.382 --> 01:01:16.025]  The United States government is in the grip of insane people.
[01:01:16.085 --> 01:01:17.666]  And I don't want to say they're evil.
[01:01:20.428 --> 01:01:27.612]  In fact, they're probably the most evil that have ever had their hands on the government.
[01:01:28.561 --> 01:01:29.982]  American people haven't a clue.
[01:01:30.042 --> 01:01:32.904]  They have no clue at all.
[01:01:33.024 --> 01:01:37.647]  They have no clue what's in store for them.
[01:01:37.908 --> 01:01:42.951]  And it's because no one was ever held accountable.
[01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:58.182]  In her murder mystery, Agatha Christie, the famous English detective novelist, she makes the point that when a murderer kills the first person, he then
[01:01:58.922 --> 01:02:02.144]  He finds it easier to kill the second, the third, and the fourth.
[01:02:02.244 --> 01:02:08.067]  And the more he kills, the easier it gets for him to be taking lives.
[01:02:08.147 --> 01:02:12.009]  And I think this is what we see happening with our government.
[01:02:12.629 --> 01:02:15.310]  They've gotten away with so many things.
[01:02:15.751 --> 01:02:17.472]  There's never been any accountability.
[01:02:18.872 --> 01:02:21.714]  And now they're just reckless.
[01:02:23.074 --> 01:02:27.977]  And this is what I say that makes you wonder what
[01:02:28.723 --> 01:02:36.445]  Will be the consequence of the recklessness of the United States government when there's a nuclear-armed Soviet Union and a China.
[01:02:37.385 --> 01:02:43.487]  And moreover, a China with a powerful economy and financial power over the United States.
[01:02:43.547 --> 01:02:46.008]  So, the recklessness.
[01:02:46.608 --> 01:02:51.829]  We could see the United States government, you know, doing the same thing Hitler did.
[01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:55.210]  He marched off into Russia, destroyed himself.
[01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:55.390]  How will
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:02.443]  I think that's true because the American people can't accept what
[01:03:26.744 --> 01:03:28.886]  Their eyes and ears should be telling them.
[01:03:29.766 --> 01:03:32.148]  And so the government never gets held accountable.
[01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:37.071]  And of course, elections don't matter because it's the same group in Washington.
[01:03:37.091 --> 01:03:42.815]  No matter who gets elected to office, it's always the same interest groups that control.
[01:03:42.895 --> 01:03:49.860]  So that's what happens when there's no accountability.
[01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:55.244]  And when the people who actually have a moral conscience and
[01:03:55.945 --> 01:03:56.546]  I think so.
[01:04:19.042 --> 01:04:22.824]  Yeah, it's being discredited because it's a separate power, and I've been meaning to get into that.
[01:04:22.844 --> 01:04:24.385]  I'm going to talk about that after you leave us.
[01:04:24.485 --> 01:04:28.868]  I want to thank you for spending so much time with us and for offering to come on on Tax Day.
[01:04:28.888 --> 01:04:40.294]  We'll talk about taxes and solutions on that day next week, Dr. Roberts, and I just want to thank you for all your years of work and for coming on this radio show when you've turned down so many others.
[01:04:41.155 --> 01:04:43.556]  Okay, Alex, it's good to talk with you.
[01:04:43.776 --> 01:04:44.517]  You stay after them.
[01:04:45.858 --> 01:04:46.558]  God bless you, sir.
[01:04:46.578 --> 01:04:47.378]  We'll see you next week.
[01:04:47.398 --> 01:04:47.779]  Take care.
[01:04:48.686 --> 01:04:50.868]  There goes Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, a great guy.
[01:04:51.328 --> 01:04:53.410]  I've been meaning to get into what's happening with the Catholic Church.
[01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:56.552]  We'll cover that when we come back and a lot more.
[01:04:56.612 --> 01:04:57.033]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.896 --> 01:05:01.877]  What's your home worth?
[01:05:02.057 --> 01:05:03.978]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:05:04.178 --> 01:05:06.901]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:05:07.201 --> 01:05:14.727]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[01:05:14.927 --> 01:05:18.350]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.676]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:06:02.756 --> 01:06:04.978]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:06:05.078 --> 01:06:07.842]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:06:08.282 --> 01:06:13.028]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:06:13.388 --> 01:06:17.593]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:06:17.893 --> 01:06:20.234]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:06:20.354 --> 01:06:22.795]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:06:23.115 --> 01:06:25.696]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:06:26.037 --> 01:06:33.620]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:39.244]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:06:39.364 --> 01:06:41.645]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:06:41.685 --> 01:06:45.648]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:06:45.908 --> 01:06:46.829]  And I got news for you.
[01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:48.290]  You're everyone else.
[01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:49.331]  Invisible Empire.

[01:07:00.267 --> 01:07:01.528]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:01.568 --> 01:07:06.911]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:07:07.151 --> 01:07:11.794]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:07:12.174 --> 01:07:17.217]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:07:17.737 --> 01:07:22.442]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:07:22.962 --> 01:07:24.904]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:07:25.284 --> 01:07:29.889]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:07:30.089 --> 01:07:30.990]  And here's the best part.
[01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:33.972]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:07:34.273 --> 01:07:37.576]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:07:37.876 --> 01:07:38.516]  Big Brother!
[01:08:07.057 --> 01:08:08.118]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.839 --> 01:08:09.940]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:11.401]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.182 --> 01:08:13.062]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.743 --> 01:08:17.366]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.907 --> 01:08:22.030]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.211 --> 01:08:28.235]  Well, that was an extremely powerful, but also sad interview with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:08:28.255 --> 01:08:29.316]  He's a wonderful person.
[01:08:30.402 --> 01:08:35.827]  I haven't commented in the last few weeks on the situation with the Catholic Church I have meant to.
[01:08:35.847 --> 01:08:37.809]  I am not a Catholic.
[01:08:38.310 --> 01:08:42.574]  I am non-denominational, but I have a lot of Catholic friends and I find they're great people.
[01:08:43.294 --> 01:08:50.201]  When I've been out protesting years ago at abortion clinics, it was almost all Catholics out there, and you will know them by their fruits.
[01:08:50.842 --> 01:08:54.845]  Now that said, we sell a video, Lamp in the Dark, exposing the incredible corruption
[01:08:55.946 --> 01:08:56.867]  Of the Catholic Church.
[01:08:57.348 --> 01:09:03.372]  It's just like I expose Israel for staging terror attacks because it's in the Jerusalem Posts and Haaretz.
[01:09:04.293 --> 01:09:07.956]  I mean, just Google Israel admits they created fake Al-Qaeda.
[01:09:08.797 --> 01:09:11.059]  Every time there's about to be a peace deal, they activate them.
[01:09:11.539 --> 01:09:13.400]  Does that mean there aren't real terrorist groups?
[01:09:13.481 --> 01:09:16.083]  No, the point is Israel has been caught doing this.
[01:09:16.203 --> 01:09:16.743]  I cover it.
[01:09:17.404 --> 01:09:18.745]  It doesn't mean I hate Israel.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.841]  I cover the corruption of the Catholic Church.
[01:09:21.861 --> 01:09:23.182]  It doesn't mean I hate Catholics.
[01:09:23.202 --> 01:09:31.488]  When Pat Robertson, who's supposedly a Protestant, comes out with global warming ads saying we've got to have global taxes with Al Sharpton, I criticize him.
[01:09:31.508 --> 01:09:35.990]  Not because I don't like Protestants, but because I don't like what Pat Robertson's doing.
[01:09:36.011 --> 01:09:48.859]  When he said ten years ago that China was, quote, doing what it had to do with extreme abortion and infanticide and birth control, forced birth control, he said they had to do it and they needed more aggressive family planning.
[01:09:50.421 --> 01:09:51.361]  And I'm a Protestant.
[01:09:52.322 --> 01:09:53.342]  But I'm criticizing him.
[01:09:53.362 --> 01:09:57.364]  What the media does, though, is you say, we've got 30 million illegal aliens in this country.
[01:09:57.384 --> 01:09:58.565]  It's bankrupting all the states.
[01:09:58.585 --> 01:10:00.346]  The government wants to bring them in as a voting bloc.
[01:10:00.846 --> 01:10:03.988]  A lot of them are criminals that are coming up here to escape justice in Mexico.
[01:10:04.428 --> 01:10:05.488]  The media says, racist!
[01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:09.090]  To get us all divided so we can't have a real debate about this.
[01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:11.191]  Or, I don't want the government running healthcare.
[01:10:11.231 --> 01:10:14.092]  It's a boondoggle for insurance companies and it'll be a new tax.
[01:10:14.413 --> 01:10:15.333]  Shut up, racist!
[01:10:15.413 --> 01:10:17.154]  Remember the media saying that over and over again?
[01:10:18.444 --> 01:10:22.086]  Naming me by name and others, Ron Paul and others, it's just nothing to do with it.
[01:10:22.586 --> 01:10:23.947]  What does that have to do with it?
[01:10:24.287 --> 01:10:25.688]  So we can't have a real debate.
[01:10:25.768 --> 01:10:32.331]  Now, I've explained this many times from studying history, and all levels of government
[01:10:34.192 --> 01:10:40.615]  Throughout the last 500 years at least, even goes back more than that, in Western Europe, it happens everywhere.
[01:10:40.635 --> 01:10:53.300]  For some reason, criminal groups, whether they're drug dealers or thieves or whatever, or pedophiles, they like to get into government positions because they can protect themselves and do whatever they want.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.502]  They can get away with it because now they have authority and the people they abuse or kill
[01:10:59.909 --> 01:11:09.577]  You know, it's their word against the person with power, so most people are scared to go after the groups with power, and so that's why criminals and psychopaths and sadists all team up together.
[01:11:11.038 --> 01:11:21.206]  And so, we've had many guests on over the years exposing the fact that a large percentage, I wouldn't say the majority from our studies, but 35, maybe more percent,
[01:11:22.137 --> 01:11:45.088]  of Catholic leadership worldwide, Africa, Asia, Latin America, North America, England, it doesn't matter, Australia, they are caught, you get one pedophile in, he moves up through the parish, he then recruits his lovers in, who also like children, and they set up a kingdom!
[01:11:46.549 --> 01:11:47.009]  Of course!
[01:11:48.595 --> 01:12:12.097]  When I set out studying this 16 years ago, 17 years ago, been on air for more than 14, I only sought after the truth in history books and government documents and I kept running into police departments that are run by pedophiles, CPS departments that are run by pedophiles, truancy departments that are run by pedophiles, DynCorp filled with pedophiles, the UN filled with pedophiles.
[01:12:13.615 --> 01:12:29.923]  You can just Google or search engine the term UN child slavery rings, UN child sex slaves, UN diplomats, child sex slaves, US diplomats, child sex slaves, UK diplomats, child sex slaves, Russian diplomats, child sex slaves.
[01:12:30.023 --> 01:12:31.464]  I mean, you put that term in.
[01:12:32.204 --> 01:12:36.927]  Let's do it right now, live on TV and for radio listeners, but we're simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:37.867 --> 01:12:41.329]  Go to Google or whatever search engine you want and type in
[01:12:42.833 --> 01:12:48.118]  DynCorp Child Sex Trafficking, or Sex Trafficking.
[01:12:48.678 --> 01:12:51.721]  And you will get AP, Reuters, Chicago Tribune.
[01:12:52.302 --> 01:12:56.585]  But it comes out here and there but never becomes a big news cycle on CNN and Fox.
[01:12:57.826 --> 01:12:58.127]  Okay?
[01:12:58.167 --> 01:12:59.268]  DynCorp International.
[01:13:00.694 --> 01:13:01.034]  There it is.
[01:13:01.335 --> 01:13:03.816]  DynCorp, Halliburton, Sex, Slave Scandal won't go away.
[01:13:03.856 --> 01:13:07.339]  That's PrisonPlanet.com and then it has links to the AP.
[01:13:07.359 --> 01:13:09.040]  In fact, print me a bunch of those.
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.742]  I know you printed them a few days ago.
[01:13:10.782 --> 01:13:18.187]  We had Catherine Austin Fitz on and she sent me emails saying, you didn't know DynCorp runs many of the CPS units in the country?
[01:13:19.849 --> 01:13:26.614]  And then I went and I found out, my God, I didn't know they were running in some states the majority of it and they've been caught there.
[01:13:28.186 --> 01:13:33.653]  And I know that it came out that they were running these operations with hundreds of thousands of children and women per year.
[01:13:35.074 --> 01:13:40.180]  Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia.
[01:13:42.103 --> 01:13:43.184]  I mean, it's so huge.
[01:13:43.204 --> 01:13:44.506]  And my point is this.
[01:13:46.323 --> 01:13:48.464]  Why are we only hearing about the Catholic Church?
[01:13:49.144 --> 01:13:54.725]  Because from my study, the United Nations... In fact, Google United Nations child sex abuse.
[01:13:55.486 --> 01:13:58.326]  And barbecuing children over fires.
[01:13:58.386 --> 01:13:59.867]  I mean, folks, you can do the research yourself.
[01:14:00.467 --> 01:14:01.967]  It is just unbelievable.
[01:14:04.288 --> 01:14:06.669]  And follow through those articles, because I want to get AP and Reuters.
[01:14:06.689 --> 01:14:07.989]  I don't want to just show our boil-down story.
[01:14:08.029 --> 01:14:10.790]  People say, oh, that's not Prison Planet, InfoWars.
[01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:14.551]  No, I mean, because you guys printed what Fitz was on Monday or Tuesday?
[01:14:15.211 --> 01:14:15.431]  Monday?
[01:14:17.099 --> 01:14:18.861]  Yeah, and you guys found me.
[01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:20.664]  Reuters, AP, and Chicago Tribune.
[01:14:20.684 --> 01:14:22.406]  In fact, that's over in this stack.
[01:14:23.788 --> 01:14:25.390]  The point is, this is real.
[01:14:26.471 --> 01:14:28.834]  And yes, the Catholic Church covered this up.
[01:14:29.735 --> 01:14:30.977]  Because it goes right to the top.
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:33.680]  Ratzinger.
[01:14:35.263 --> 01:14:38.106]  You know, was involved covering this stuff up 30 years ago.
[01:14:38.146 --> 01:14:38.826]  That's confirmed.
[01:14:39.167 --> 01:14:43.791]  And the establishment is in some internal war blackmailing the Vatican over something.
[01:14:43.811 --> 01:14:47.995]  The Vatican's criticizing abortion, they're criticizing wars, they're criticizing Israel.
[01:14:48.295 --> 01:14:53.519]  For whatever reason, this is the only group that is being exposed.
[01:14:55.481 --> 01:14:56.662]  And you've got a U.S.
[01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:57.123]  media
[01:14:58.579 --> 01:15:00.040]  There's Chicago Tribune, U.S.
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:02.382]  stalls on human trafficking.
[01:15:02.402 --> 01:15:05.825]  Pentagon has yet to ban contractors from using forced labor.
[01:15:06.485 --> 01:15:09.107]  And that's literally tens of thousands of slaves in that article from 2005.
[01:15:10.428 --> 01:15:16.693]  But you can also search one, Chicago Tribune, DynCorp, child trafficking, and it'll come up.
[01:15:18.635 --> 01:15:24.239]  So my issue is, why are they only covering the Catholic Church?
[01:15:24.579 --> 01:15:25.220]  And they should be.
[01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:37.378]  But they should also be covering the Texas Youth Commission and facilities all over the state where the parking lots would fill up at night with people coming in to have sex with the kids that have been CPSed or the kids in juvenile.
[01:15:38.978 --> 01:15:45.262]  They even had paid gladiatory fights where they would have them fight with weapons for betting.
[01:15:45.302 --> 01:15:48.024]  I mean, these are treated like game cocks or animals.
[01:15:49.325 --> 01:15:53.227]  And so that's my issue here is that
[01:15:54.622 --> 01:15:55.783]  How many Republican leaders?
[01:15:55.823 --> 01:15:56.823]  How many Democratic leaders?
[01:15:56.863 --> 01:16:05.889]  Barney Frank was caught repeatedly with underage male prostitutes, 15, 16, 17 years old, out of a Georgetown complex.
[01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:14.975]  He didn't get in trouble because he gave a press conference and said, if you don't back off until the FBI to stop now, and it was confirmed it was happening, he said, I'm going to tell you what's really going on.
[01:16:15.435 --> 01:16:16.976]  And they shut up instantly.
[01:16:18.581 --> 01:16:20.482]  Congressman Foley caught doing this stuff.
[01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:22.082]  How many CPS workers?
[01:16:22.122 --> 01:16:27.904]  How many times do you see it in the back of the paper where the local Homeland Security head was caught, you know, molesting children?
[01:16:30.385 --> 01:16:33.546]  Or flying in airplanes to meet with people that are going to sell them a kid?
[01:16:35.427 --> 01:16:38.948]  When I tell you, I mean, you heard Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, head of the Treasury,
[01:16:39.724 --> 01:16:52.154]  You know, editor at Wall Street Journal, father of Reaganomics, saying, and he wasn't like this five years ago on the show, he's now been educated, saying the greatest evil in history is now in control of our government.
[01:16:52.455 --> 01:16:55.437]  The greatest, most sophisticated evil.
[01:16:56.538 --> 01:16:58.159]  And so how do these people work together?
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:16:59.621]  Globally.
[01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:01.502]  It's a network of perverts.
[01:17:01.702 --> 01:17:03.444]  It's a network of pedophiles.
[01:17:04.245 --> 01:17:05.646]  And that's just one group of them.
[01:17:06.566 --> 01:17:06.847]  Others,
[01:17:08.319 --> 01:17:12.760]  People like to brutalize women, savagely, viciously.
[01:17:13.821 --> 01:17:26.525]  When you see movies like Hostel, produced by Quentin Tarantino, I have seen scores of articles in the Times of London, in British papers and in French papers.
[01:17:26.545 --> 01:17:34.047]  I remember one in Burgundy, France, this woman escaped from a castle that was owned by one of the richest people in France.
[01:17:35.026 --> 01:17:38.829]  She weighed less than 85 pounds, like a concentration camp victim.
[01:17:39.489 --> 01:17:41.851]  She got to the local state police office.
[01:17:42.431 --> 01:17:47.014]  They went to the castle and found a bunch of dead women in cages, and it was just shut down.
[01:17:47.175 --> 01:17:48.075]  Nothing was going to be done.
[01:17:50.257 --> 01:17:53.479]  I mean, every day I read about some little girl on her bicycle disappears.
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:18:00.284]  And the CIA loads them on planes, DynCorp loads them on, and they just do... This is who does it!
[01:18:01.244 --> 01:18:03.246]  And the CPS hunts children,
[01:18:04.261 --> 01:18:06.823]  The CPS has bounties on kids that look a certain way.
[01:18:07.303 --> 01:18:11.265]  They wait at the city-owned hospitals with poor people who are having blonde-haired, blue-eyed kids.
[01:18:11.285 --> 01:18:11.826]  Those can go for $500,000.
[01:18:11.966 --> 01:18:14.487]  It goes through an adoption agency.
[01:18:14.527 --> 01:18:15.788]  It goes to the person that wants them.
[01:18:18.089 --> 01:18:23.973]  And of course, these criminals that run things, they then use their own system as a persecution arm against the public.
[01:18:25.474 --> 01:18:30.317]  Most of the sex offenders in the registries now were caught urinating behind their car.
[01:18:31.613 --> 01:18:35.295]  In fact, the President even talked about that with America's Most Wanted individual.
[01:18:36.877 --> 01:18:40.639]  Well, there are a lot of people who, you know, get caught urinating at Mardi Gras who are on it.
[01:18:40.659 --> 01:18:42.200]  But we're not talking about them.
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.381]  Well, that is who you're talking about.
[01:18:43.921 --> 01:18:57.730]  If you are caught by the state police, and in some places in Texas it may be a hundred miles to a gas station, and every one of us is guilty of the crime of being a human and pulling over, walking over to the barbed wire fence, getting behind a bush and urinating.
[01:18:58.691 --> 01:18:58.911]  Nope.
[01:18:59.191 --> 01:19:01.253]  That is a sex crime.
[01:19:04.312 --> 01:19:05.974]  The majority is made up of those.
[01:19:06.034 --> 01:19:18.044]  People urinating, people, I mean, out in the middle of nowhere, I see it in the news all the time, on deserted highways, cop pulls up, I saw him behind that bush, they go over and see the urine, they get you to admit, sex offender.
[01:19:18.325 --> 01:19:20.206]  Because you're an animal to be put in the system.
[01:19:20.406 --> 01:19:26.432]  His boss is probably raping a kid at some government dungeon while he's putting you in the squad car.
[01:19:26.612 --> 01:19:29.415]  They've got some two-year-old baby they're raping to death, okay?
[01:19:30.195 --> 01:19:35.960]  I mean, that's who these people are, and it's a big joke to them to then grab you and take you away for what they do.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:45.187]  And then, of course, the other big percentage of them are 18-year-old guys who have a 16-year-old girlfriend, or an 18-year-old girl who's got a 17-year-old boyfriend.
[01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:47.028]  That's who they go after.
[01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:51.112]  The hardcore pedophiles run everything.
[01:19:52.006 --> 01:20:00.736]  And so they run the Catholic Church, they run the major corporations, they run Bohemian Grove, they run it all, and your kids are nothing but fresh meat for them.
[01:20:01.156 --> 01:20:02.838]  Oh, my sinuses!
[01:20:02.938 --> 01:20:04.660]  They feel like they'll explode!
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:05.541]  Sinus pressure.
[01:20:05.681 --> 01:20:07.343]  Sinus headaches that keep you up at night.
[01:20:07.443 --> 01:20:08.564]  You've struggled for years.
[01:20:08.704 --> 01:20:14.348]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[01:20:14.548 --> 01:20:15.129]  Sound familiar?
[01:20:15.309 --> 01:20:16.129]  Well, you're not alone.
[01:20:16.349 --> 01:20:19.812]  Statistics show that 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress.
[01:20:19.992 --> 01:20:24.855]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.
[01:20:25.036 --> 01:20:27.477]  Now there's a solution that's safe and doctor recommended.
[01:20:27.697 --> 01:20:30.179]  Sinofresh homeopathic antiseptic nasal spray.
[01:20:30.339 --> 01:20:31.340]  It's the only patent protected
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:31.880]  We're good to go!
[01:21:01.009 --> 01:21:04.671]  The mighty Roman soldier was given a daily ration of fermented fish oil.
[01:21:05.032 --> 01:21:09.594]  The stoic Scandinavian Viking had a drum of fermenting cod livers outside the door of his home.
[01:21:10.034 --> 01:21:12.956]  And Grandma always had cod liver oil in the cupboard.
[01:21:13.276 --> 01:21:22.321]  Today, Green Pasture Products, a family-owned business, provides high-quality, nutrient-dense cod and other fish liver oils made in the same way they've been made throughout history prior to 1850.
[01:21:23.322 --> 01:21:24.362]  Through fermentation!
[01:21:24.562 --> 01:21:34.944]  Cold-fermented cod liver oil from Green Pasture is rich in vitamins A, D, E, K, omega-3, omega-9s, and more, but no man-made nutrients, only what the fish provides.
[01:21:35.164 --> 01:21:41.206]  Green Pasture's products are clean, independently tested for impurities, made in the USA, and come in capsules or liquids.

[01:21:47.987 --> 01:21:49.428]  They helped to create a new world order.
[01:21:49.448 --> 01:21:50.990]  We are part of a new world order.
[01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:53.412]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[01:22:08.864 --> 01:22:13.606]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:22:13.966 --> 01:22:18.188]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:22:18.488 --> 01:22:20.849]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:22:20.949 --> 01:22:23.390]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:22:23.710 --> 01:22:26.292]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:22:26.632 --> 01:22:34.215]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:22:34.555 --> 01:22:39.818]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:22:39.958 --> 01:22:42.220]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:46.242]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:22:46.502 --> 01:22:47.423]  And I got news for you.
[01:22:47.563 --> 01:22:48.764]  You're everyone else.
[01:22:48.904 --> 01:22:49.924]  Invisible Empire.

[01:23:00.615 --> 01:23:00.916]  Fact.
[01:23:00.936 --> 01:23:02.518]  4 million people in the U.S.
[01:23:02.538 --> 01:23:04.340]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[01:23:04.661 --> 01:23:04.981]  Fact.
[01:23:05.181 --> 01:23:08.546]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the 8th leading cause of death among Americans.
[01:23:08.886 --> 01:23:09.187]  Fact.
[01:23:09.487 --> 01:23:14.814]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[01:23:15.014 --> 01:23:15.275]  Fact.
[01:23:15.695 --> 01:23:19.477]  1 in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[01:23:19.817 --> 01:23:20.157]  Fact!
[01:23:20.397 --> 01:23:24.159]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[01:24:25.734 --> 01:24:38.405]  Back in 2005 when there were congressional hearings about why Dyncor and Halliburton were running child kidnapping rings, kidnapping women, tens of thousands of men flying them around the world to slave camps at brick factories.
[01:24:38.425 --> 01:24:40.627]  I mean, that's Chicago Tribune right here.
[01:24:42.299 --> 01:24:44.001]  And I walked out of P.F.
[01:24:44.041 --> 01:24:49.386]  Chang's Chinese restaurant and Dinecore's headquarters was down the street.
[01:24:49.486 --> 01:24:52.990]  I was going to my car and I saw these cops standing around laughing.
[01:24:53.050 --> 01:24:53.991]  One of them was a commander.
[01:24:54.011 --> 01:24:56.774]  And I said, gentlemen, have you read the news?
[01:24:56.794 --> 01:25:01.919]  Have you searched it about Dinecore, that building right there, running giant child kidnapping rings worldwide?
[01:25:01.939 --> 01:25:04.541]  And the cops just laughed at me and it was real funny and they said,
[01:25:05.874 --> 01:25:07.535]  Yeah, Jones, I do work for them.
[01:25:08.056 --> 01:25:10.317]  And I don't know what that meant, but it was real.
[01:25:10.337 --> 01:25:11.558]  It was like five, six cops.
[01:25:11.618 --> 01:25:12.579]  It was very funny.
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:14.941]  No, you see, it's not funny.
[01:25:16.002 --> 01:25:19.104]  And the fact that they're going to take your pension funds isn't going to be funny.
[01:25:19.424 --> 01:25:22.867]  And the fact that they're going to put all these taxes on our economy and destroy our future isn't funny.
[01:25:23.147 --> 01:25:27.470]  You think globalists that kill over a million Iraqis the last seven years are a joke?
[01:25:28.271 --> 01:25:30.412]  You think your butt is worth anything to them?
[01:25:31.193 --> 01:25:32.634]  It's worth as much as those Iraqis.
[01:25:35.219 --> 01:25:36.783]  I know there are great police officers out there.
[01:25:36.803 --> 01:25:39.249]  They email us, they send us information, they send us documents.
[01:25:40.424 --> 01:25:43.265]  But I'm not up here risking my life to play games, okay?
[01:25:43.285 --> 01:25:44.365]  What we're talking about is true.
[01:25:44.385 --> 01:25:45.925]  Give me a document cam shot on this.
[01:25:46.665 --> 01:25:47.765]  Chicago Tribune.
[01:25:47.885 --> 01:25:48.145]  U.S.
[01:25:48.165 --> 01:25:49.406]  stalls on human trafficking.
[01:25:49.446 --> 01:25:52.666]  Pentagon has yet to ban contractors from using forced labor.
[01:25:53.246 --> 01:25:58.167]  Three years ago, President Bush declared that he had zero tolerance for trafficking in humans by the government overseas contractors.
[01:25:58.207 --> 01:26:00.248]  And two years ago, Congress mandated a similar policy.
[01:26:00.728 --> 01:26:06.709]  But notwithstanding the President's statement in the Congressional Edict, the Defense Department has yet to adopt a policy to bar human trafficking.
[01:26:07.449 --> 01:26:11.079]  The biggest names is Dyncor International and Halliburton Subsidiary KBR.
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:14.248]  Both have been linked to traffic related concerns and it goes through it.
[01:26:16.152 --> 01:26:16.512]  Here's one.
[01:26:16.552 --> 01:26:19.814]  DynCorp and Halliburton sex slave scandal won't go away.
[01:26:19.834 --> 01:26:21.175]  And it's got the AP article.
[01:26:21.755 --> 01:26:26.638]  It's got the congressperson asking him, grilled Secretary Rumsfeld and General Myers on the DynCorp scandal.
[01:26:27.218 --> 01:26:29.239]  We can play this video, but here's the text.
[01:26:29.519 --> 01:26:36.803]  Mr. Secretary, I watched President Bush deliver a moving speech at the United Nations in September 2003 in which he mentioned the crisis of the sex trade.
[01:26:36.823 --> 01:26:39.965]  The President called for the punishment of those involved in the horrible business.
[01:26:40.305 --> 01:26:45.409]  But at the very moment of the speech, DynCorp was exposed for having been involved in the buying and selling of young women and children.
[01:26:45.789 --> 01:26:55.137]  While all of this was going on, DynCorp kept the Pentagon contract to administer the smallpox and anthrax vaccines and is now working on a plague vaccine to the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program.
[01:26:55.397 --> 01:26:57.338]  Mr. Secretary, is it the policy of the U.S.
[01:26:57.378 --> 01:27:00.481]  government to reward companies that traffic in women and little girls?
[01:27:02.366 --> 01:27:04.088]  The McKinney's comeback was as follows.
[01:27:04.649 --> 01:27:05.530]  Thank you, Representative.
[01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:08.794]  First, the answer to your first question is no, absolutely not.
[01:27:09.115 --> 01:27:13.561]  The policy of the United States government is clear, unambiguous, and opposed to the activities you described.
[01:27:13.601 --> 01:27:14.342]  The second question.
[01:27:15.424 --> 01:27:15.844]  McKinney.
[01:27:16.225 --> 01:27:22.531]  Well, how do you explain the fact that Dyncor and its successor companies have received and continue to receive government contracts?
[01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:22.992]  Rumsfeld.
[01:27:23.392 --> 01:27:32.141]  I would have to go and find the facts, but there are laws and rules and regulations with respect to government contracts, and there are times that corporations do things that they should not.
[01:27:32.541 --> 01:27:34.162]  Oh, it's just something they shouldn't do.
[01:27:34.743 --> 01:27:38.926]  In which case, they tend to be suspended for a period.
[01:27:38.966 --> 01:27:48.433]  There are times that, under the laws and the rules and regulations for the passed by the Congress, implemented by the executive branch, that corporations can get off.
[01:27:49.757 --> 01:27:50.178]  All right.
[01:28:08.317 --> 01:28:13.961]  That it was not the corporation that was engaged in the activities you characterized, but I'm told it was an employee of the corporation.
[01:28:14.001 --> 01:28:14.882]  It was some years ago.
[01:28:15.322 --> 01:28:15.703]  Oh, really?
[01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:19.486]  We now have the ruling by a court by the employees that sued that it was directed.
[01:28:19.846 --> 01:28:20.727]  Here's Salon.
[01:28:21.567 --> 01:28:25.670]  Sex slave whistleblower vindicated.
[01:28:26.051 --> 01:28:36.859]  Two former employees of DynCorp, the government contract powerhouse, have won legal victories after charging that the $2 billion a year firm fired them when they complained that co-workers were involved in Bosnian sex slave trade.
[01:28:39.616 --> 01:28:40.717]  Here's another headline.
[01:28:41.037 --> 01:28:42.558]  This is out of CorpWatch.
[01:28:43.039 --> 01:28:43.379]  U.S.
[01:28:43.419 --> 01:28:45.701]  sex scandal still haunts DynCorp.
[01:28:47.162 --> 01:28:47.422]  U.N.
[01:28:47.502 --> 01:28:49.464]  child sex slave scandal continues.
[01:28:50.424 --> 01:28:51.365]  BBC.
[01:28:52.166 --> 01:28:52.946]  It goes on and on.
[01:28:53.086 --> 01:28:53.847]  UPI.
[01:28:53.867 --> 01:28:57.650]  I mean, DynCorp.
[01:28:59.346 --> 01:29:04.069]  They get a chance to win 1.6 billion trading contracts, and now they're the big CPS contractor.
[01:29:04.349 --> 01:29:10.832]  DynCorp people that kidnap kids and women worldwide and take them to unbelievable, in some cases, death.
[01:29:11.453 --> 01:29:13.173]  They are your CPS workers now.
[01:29:13.994 --> 01:29:18.396]  Because they, I've read the statistics, more than 50% of CPS workers quit within one year.
[01:29:19.177 --> 01:29:23.199]  They go thinking they're going to help kids and are in a pedophile ring and go, my god, I better get out of here.
[01:29:24.568 --> 01:29:26.949]  So they just said, well, we'll just bring in the Dine Corps boys.
[01:29:27.389 --> 01:29:28.389]  A lot of them are foreigners.
[01:29:28.929 --> 01:29:32.570]  We've had British members of Parliament on about how most of the contractors there are foreigners.
[01:29:33.871 --> 01:29:38.052]  They just bring in hardcore sickos, man, and they are here.
[01:29:38.092 --> 01:29:42.874]  And if you, they don't have courts, laws, nothing, and they just call in the SWAT team.
[01:29:42.894 --> 01:29:43.414]  Get in here.
[01:29:43.454 --> 01:29:45.034]  These parents aren't handing the kid over.
[01:29:45.354 --> 01:29:45.994]  I got a flight.
[01:29:46.034 --> 01:29:47.755]  I got to put this kid on in one week.
[01:29:48.035 --> 01:29:49.015]  I need you here to get him.
[01:29:49.055 --> 01:29:49.676]  You understand?
[01:29:49.716 --> 01:29:50.096]  Get here.
[01:29:51.076 --> 01:29:51.996]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.476 --> 01:29:53.977]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.984 --> 01:30:05.807]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:30:05.867 --> 01:30:08.568]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:30:08.608 --> 01:30:13.069]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:18.392]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[01:31:01.018 --> 01:31:03.621]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:04.021 --> 01:31:09.007]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.368 --> 01:31:11.090]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.410 --> 01:31:16.236]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.416 --> 01:31:17.337]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.577 --> 01:31:18.337]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.717 --> 01:31:20.318]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.578 --> 01:31:21.418]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.658 --> 01:31:23.738]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.858 --> 01:31:24.979]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.199 --> 01:31:26.539]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.739 --> 01:31:31.800]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.201]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.581 --> 01:31:39.082]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.402 --> 01:31:40.382]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.622 --> 01:31:41.242]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.522 --> 01:31:42.443]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.623 --> 01:31:43.363]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.563 --> 01:31:44.243]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.643 --> 01:31:44.863]  I think?
[01:32:00.069 --> 01:32:01.331]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:01.371 --> 01:32:06.717]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:06.957 --> 01:32:11.582]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:11.983 --> 01:32:12.383]  It's true.
[01:32:12.463 --> 01:32:17.008]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:32:17.549 --> 01:32:22.234]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:22.775 --> 01:32:24.697]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:32:25.077 --> 01:32:29.702]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:29.883 --> 01:32:30.784]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:31.004 --> 01:32:33.787]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:32:34.067 --> 01:32:37.371]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:37.691 --> 01:32:40.513]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:40.873 --> 01:32:42.754]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:43.094 --> 01:32:44.015]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.035 --> 01:32:44.335]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.355 --> 01:32:47.176]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:47.677 --> 01:32:49.398]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:12.805 --> 01:33:30.737]  Okay, in the last hour and a half of this Wednesday live broadcast, we're going to open the phones up on the value-added tax, sales taxes, and carbon taxes Obama is pushing with the support of the Republican Party and Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly telling you it's so conservative we've got to do this.
[01:33:31.458 --> 01:33:35.621]  We're going to be going back over that information.
[01:33:36.789 --> 01:33:41.212]  I'm also going to get into the Kyrgyzstan shootings that just happened.
[01:33:41.712 --> 01:33:47.316]  Clearly the West over there trying to cause an implosion, trying to destabilize Russia and China.
[01:33:48.697 --> 01:33:54.660]  Also, increase in Arctic ice confounds doomsayers but does not spell the end of global warming, scientists warn.
[01:33:55.221 --> 01:33:58.423]  Yeah, record level sea ice, that's global warming.
[01:34:00.652 --> 01:34:03.274]  And we do have that satellite footage I sent you, right?
[01:34:04.855 --> 01:34:06.937]  And see, I found it about a year ago on a NASA site.
[01:34:06.957 --> 01:34:07.817]  I haven't found it since.
[01:34:08.478 --> 01:34:11.540]  It's a time-lapse with a composite from satellites from 76.
[01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:18.845]  In fact, Google 30-year time-lapse of Arctic ice.
[01:34:18.865 --> 01:34:20.387]  30-year time-lapse.
[01:34:21.494 --> 01:34:23.836]  No, no, that's a one-year that I was able to find this morning.
[01:34:24.216 --> 01:34:26.297]  We have up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:26.678 --> 01:34:32.561]  We're going to play that one, but now that I think about it, let's try one more go or see if Watson can find it.
[01:34:32.602 --> 01:34:34.143]  He couldn't even find it last time I wanted to.
[01:34:34.663 --> 01:34:36.264]  It was a 30-year composite.
[01:34:39.846 --> 01:34:42.548]  So wait, it was 78 to 2008.
[01:34:44.850 --> 01:34:45.430]  That's what it was.
[01:34:46.811 --> 01:34:50.974]  A 30-year satellite composite because why it's important is
[01:34:52.429 --> 01:34:53.790]  It shows what happens.
[01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:54.890]  It's so elementary.
[01:34:55.411 --> 01:34:56.311]  And this is of the Arctic.
[01:34:57.492 --> 01:34:58.613]  There's another one of the Antarctic.
[01:34:58.633 --> 01:34:59.673]  You can find either one.
[01:34:59.693 --> 01:35:00.434]  It'll show the same thing.
[01:35:01.274 --> 01:35:02.995]  I know it's elementary for all of you out there.
[01:35:03.635 --> 01:35:14.442]  It's not elementary for Congressman Hank Johnson of Georgia, who believes that islands are floating on the water and too many people get on one side of an island, it will capsize, as he said last week in congressional testimony.
[01:35:15.522 --> 01:35:16.303]  But in the summer,
[01:35:17.574 --> 01:35:23.116]  The Arctic gets smaller, and in the fall and winter, it gets bigger.
[01:35:23.136 --> 01:35:27.598]  And he goes, with the seasons, big, small, big, small.
[01:35:28.938 --> 01:35:29.578]  Big, small.
[01:35:29.879 --> 01:35:30.499]  Big, small.
[01:35:31.399 --> 01:35:38.702]  But they point a satellite at it, and show three months in the summer, and show it shrinking, and go, oh my god, sea levels are all dead, pass the carbon tax!
[01:35:39.002 --> 01:35:40.662]  They know full well that's a fraud.
[01:35:41.263 --> 01:35:43.283]  They talk to you like you're five-year-old idiots.
[01:35:43.964 --> 01:35:44.584]  I don't do that.
[01:35:46.906 --> 01:35:49.267]  They talk to you like you're low-grade morons.
[01:35:55.411 --> 01:35:56.331]  Islands don't float.
[01:35:56.351 --> 01:35:57.452]  They're not going to capsize.
[01:35:57.512 --> 01:35:58.893]  Man, is it causing the earthquakes.
[01:35:59.433 --> 01:36:02.955]  And paying Al Gore some money isn't going to save you.
[01:36:04.536 --> 01:36:08.658]  So we're going to be going over some of that as well today.
[01:36:08.938 --> 01:36:09.979]  I just opened the phones up.
[01:36:10.019 --> 01:36:12.900]  Let me pull up my call list here.
[01:36:14.721 --> 01:36:15.382]  And we will
[01:36:16.854 --> 01:36:18.795]  Go to your calls here in just a moment.
[01:36:18.835 --> 01:36:20.737]  John, is that IM going to you that I just sent you?
[01:36:20.757 --> 01:36:24.319]  Okay, good.
[01:36:24.339 --> 01:36:25.800]  We'll just give the guys my calls then.
[01:36:27.141 --> 01:36:34.866]  We have a hybrid radio show here where there's Genesis up in Minnesota, and then I'm down here in Austin, Texas.
[01:36:34.886 --> 01:36:38.969]  You can just IM those to one of the other guys, and then print them and bring them to me.
[01:36:39.329 --> 01:36:40.570]  We'll get through this one way or the other.
[01:36:43.851 --> 01:36:45.152]  And then we're down here in Austin, Texas.
[01:36:45.172 --> 01:36:47.634]  We can take calls from our end or from the other end.
[01:36:47.654 --> 01:36:48.875]  In fact, let's just take calls from our end.
[01:36:48.895 --> 01:36:49.575]  We'll just do it that way.
[01:36:49.595 --> 01:36:50.676]  888-201-2244.
[01:36:50.696 --> 01:36:52.998]  888-201-2244 is the toll-free number.
[01:36:53.018 --> 01:36:53.058]  888-201-2244.
[01:36:53.078 --> 01:36:57.061]  And make sure they know I just opened the phones up in there.
[01:36:57.081 --> 01:36:58.301]  We got a Roger Roger on that?
[01:37:07.048 --> 01:37:09.029]  Okay.
[01:37:09.049 --> 01:37:12.390]  888-201-2244, or you can call the Genesis lines at 800-686-2237.
[01:37:12.471 --> 01:37:22.835]  And I'm going to take calls this segment, so I need you guys to get those for me and bring them in on paper.
[01:37:22.855 --> 01:37:24.116]  Then we'll do it low-tech here.
[01:37:24.136 --> 01:37:24.596]  800-686-2237.
[01:37:24.656 --> 01:37:26.757]  That's the Genesis phones, just so you know.
[01:37:26.817 --> 01:37:26.877]  Now,
[01:37:39.807 --> 01:37:42.108]  They just disgust me so much to see all this happening.
[01:37:43.809 --> 01:37:45.230]  I don't even want to cover all this news.
[01:37:47.272 --> 01:37:52.174]  I don't even want to go over it.
[01:37:53.195 --> 01:37:54.416]  I don't even want to have to cover this.
[01:37:54.456 --> 01:37:55.857]  I'm so sick of the New World Order.
[01:37:56.517 --> 01:37:58.899]  I'm so sick of all the crimes they commit.
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:05.723]  I'm so sick of the public like a bunch of stupid children not wanting to face corruption or evil.
[01:38:06.763 --> 01:38:07.744]  Not realizing that
[01:38:09.384 --> 01:38:14.628]  No one is safe while all of this is going on.
[01:38:15.849 --> 01:38:17.710]  John, did you just get that info I just sent you?
[01:38:21.393 --> 01:38:21.874]  Okay, good.
[01:38:21.914 --> 01:38:22.254]  Thank you.
[01:38:23.054 --> 01:38:26.637]  I'm just in here running my own call board system.
[01:38:33.262 --> 01:38:35.704]  Let's go ahead and talk to Pete in South Carolina.
[01:38:35.744 --> 01:38:36.465]  Pete, you're on the air.
[01:38:36.525 --> 01:38:36.865]  Go ahead.
[01:38:38.041 --> 01:38:40.282]  Hey Alex, I was trying to call in.
[01:38:40.622 --> 01:38:44.223]  I had a comment about how you're talking about the pedophiles and the CPS and all that.
[01:38:45.003 --> 01:38:46.624]  A few years ago I was a victim.
[01:38:46.664 --> 01:38:48.685]  My three kids were a victim of CPS.
[01:38:49.445 --> 01:38:54.426]  And what they did, their mother had left us for five years, had nothing to do with the kids.
[01:38:55.207 --> 01:38:58.708]  They got their fingers in on me during a nasty divorce.
[01:38:58.808 --> 01:39:02.069]  But basically I was the picture-perfect parent.
[01:39:02.888 --> 01:39:07.311]  It'd be really nice if you had a phone that worked, because we want to hear what you have to say, Pete.
[01:39:07.351 --> 01:39:08.872]  Can you hear me now?
[01:39:08.892 --> 01:39:09.433]  Yeah, you were on a
[01:39:28.553 --> 01:39:29.013]  Okay.
[01:39:29.173 --> 01:39:38.097]  Well anyways, CPS... Now hold on just a minute, hold on just a minute, because I've asked listeners that when people call in on cordlesses or headsets, no one can hear you.
[01:39:38.117 --> 01:39:39.378]  It's almost pointless.
[01:39:39.798 --> 01:39:48.582]  People need to call in from the handheld at least, because now when you hear the rebroadcast, you're going to be able to hear that what you're having to say is actually being heard now.
[01:39:49.502 --> 01:39:49.783]  Okay.
[01:39:51.503 --> 01:39:51.743]  Alright.
[01:39:52.184 --> 01:39:56.666]  Well anyways, I was saying on the CPS thing, my three kids were yanked from me.
[01:39:57.759 --> 01:40:00.541]  Use the excuse that I worked too much.
[01:40:01.182 --> 01:40:07.266]  I was working 70 to 90 hours a week, running my own business, had full-time in-home daycare.
[01:40:07.306 --> 01:40:08.007]  Oh yeah, no, no, no.
[01:40:08.047 --> 01:40:11.409]  Criticizing the government, working too much, yelling at your kids.
[01:40:11.729 --> 01:40:18.114]  There's no law, they still come and take them because they're a eugenics court set up a hundred years ago in this country outside of law.
[01:40:18.835 --> 01:40:27.201]  I understand, and what I wanted to offer up to you and your listeners is the way they played me was they said I worked too much, that bothered them, they took the kids, they wanted me to do
[01:40:27.697 --> 01:40:29.038]  All kinds of counseling and stuff.
[01:40:29.078 --> 01:40:30.618]  I've done everything they offered.
[01:40:30.638 --> 01:40:32.999]  Yeah, that's a hidden tax.
[01:40:33.039 --> 01:40:33.880]  That's a hidden tax.
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:42.344]  They make you pay to go to their $300, $400 an hour psychologist that they recommend, who then lie about you, and it's all a big setup.
[01:40:43.144 --> 01:40:51.228]  Yep, and what they did was they put them with the mother who left for five years and wanted nothing to do with them, and actually had tried to kill the kids previously.
[01:40:51.966 --> 01:40:57.734]  And, uh, I kind of seen through what they were doing because my own attorney was bought off and threw me under the bus.
[01:40:58.275 --> 01:41:09.650]  And what they were doing was trying to take the kids from me and prove me as an unfit parent, meanwhile putting them just temporarily with their poor mother because they knew that in the long run, once they proved me unfit,
[01:41:10.017 --> 01:41:11.998]  Well, I had to give up hope on my kids.
[01:41:12.018 --> 01:41:16.501]  The last two court dates that we went to, I didn't show up for because every time I went to a court date, things got worse.
[01:41:16.561 --> 01:41:18.262]  They pushed me further away from my kids.
[01:41:38.891 --> 01:41:41.012]  And further away, I got less visitation.
[01:41:41.032 --> 01:41:42.653]  So what happened?
[01:41:42.673 --> 01:41:43.773]  What ended up happening, sir?
[01:41:43.793 --> 01:41:44.253]  We gotta go.
[01:41:44.333 --> 01:41:50.816]  Well, the kids are still with their mother, the mother that tried to poison them and had nothing to do with them for all their life.
[01:41:51.717 --> 01:41:54.478]  And I get absolutely no visitation, no communication.
[01:41:54.943 --> 01:41:57.204]  Well, Pete, that really doesn't help us, but I appreciate it.
[01:41:57.244 --> 01:41:59.405]  I mean, you're saying the information may help people.
[01:41:59.865 --> 01:42:02.907]  I mean, I guess it helps people to know to not communicate with them.
[01:42:03.227 --> 01:42:07.529]  But they get involved in your family in the middle, and this is how they do it.
[01:42:07.709 --> 01:42:09.210]  And then real abuse is ignored.
[01:42:09.570 --> 01:42:15.433]  You know, the cops can tase their little kids, schools can beat them, drug them, lock them up, whatever they want.
[01:42:15.473 --> 01:42:18.014]  But if parents yell at their kids, they're supposedly evil.
[01:42:18.054 --> 01:42:19.655]  Pete, I'm sorry to hear that that happened to you.
[01:42:21.172 --> 01:42:23.533]  But it's a deranged society, and it's only going to get worse.
[01:42:23.593 --> 01:42:24.914]  Jeff in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:42:24.934 --> 01:42:28.235]  Hi Alex, a bit of a police state grid update.
[01:42:28.295 --> 01:42:33.137]  I was sent this video on interesting sea creatures, and I watched it all the way through.
[01:42:33.797 --> 01:42:42.041]  And after it, this IBM infomercial came on about how they're putting in the mileage tax in Stockholm, Sweden.
[01:42:42.381 --> 01:42:45.082]  And how great it is here in America, and how we've got to have it.
[01:42:45.623 --> 01:42:47.463]  Yeah, and how it makes the traffic better.
[01:42:49.104 --> 01:42:57.911]  Well, I was on a talk radio show a few weeks ago, and they told me I was a conspiracy theorist, as all the states and the federal government announce that they're going to have mileage taxes.
[01:42:57.951 --> 01:42:59.272]  I told people this a decade ago.
[01:42:59.692 --> 01:43:00.613]  It doesn't exist.
[01:43:00.793 --> 01:43:09.380]  Even when the mileage tax system is in your car, people will say it doesn't exist, because it's a mind trick of slaves to just deny everything.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:15.084]  If you YouTube search IBM traffic in Stockholm, anybody can find it.
[01:43:15.865 --> 01:43:16.826]  It's powerful.
[01:43:16.866 --> 01:43:18.067]  We played it about a month ago here.
[01:43:18.607 --> 01:43:27.692]  I wonder if you observed over the last few years any of the unmarked white vans in Austin that set up along Mopac with the little white camera boxes on tripods.
[01:43:27.732 --> 01:43:28.513]  Did you ever see those?
[01:43:29.534 --> 01:43:36.097]  There's all sorts of alphabet soup out there, categorizing the sheep, slaves, tracking their cattle, tracking their property.
[01:43:37.077 --> 01:43:41.939]  And they've got all sorts of surveillance pods, listening to everybody's cell phones, intercepting everything.
[01:43:41.979 --> 01:43:46.801]  And that's just total criminality, using our money to enslave us while the illegal aliens are above the law.
[01:43:46.821 --> 01:43:47.882]  Jeff, I appreciate your call.
[01:43:48.262 --> 01:43:50.182]  Tim in Brazil, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:43:51.383 --> 01:43:52.443]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:43:53.204 --> 01:43:56.045]  I was just calling in about the CPS thing you're talking about.
[01:43:57.130 --> 01:43:57.810]  Yes.
[01:43:58.290 --> 01:44:04.152]  But we're not supposed to worry about DynCorp and the CPS openly running child kidnapping everywhere.
[01:44:04.352 --> 01:44:07.873]  We're supposed to obsess on the Catholic Church, which is guilty and is doing bad.
[01:44:08.293 --> 01:44:14.615]  But see, the very pedophile-ringed government media can make itself look good by pointing the finger at the Catholic Church.
[01:44:15.275 --> 01:44:17.196]  Yeah, but why don't they point the finger at PNAC?
[01:44:19.537 --> 01:44:20.017]  PNAC?
[01:44:20.517 --> 01:44:23.138]  Yeah, the Project for the New American Century.
[01:44:23.872 --> 01:44:24.452]  Absolutely.
[01:44:24.493 --> 01:44:26.534]  Dick Cheney saying we need to stage terror attacks.
[01:44:26.974 --> 01:44:27.615]  Exactly.
[01:44:28.295 --> 01:44:34.219]  I mean, you know, in the 1950s you have Irving Kristol, the founder of neoconservatism.
[01:44:34.619 --> 01:44:38.062]  Who was the head Trotskyite, the head communist in our hemisphere.
[01:44:38.542 --> 01:44:40.163]  And then he installed it into Bush.
[01:44:41.244 --> 01:44:43.025]  Installed it into his son William Kristol.
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:49.441]  And all the Rush Limbaugh conservatives just bow down and worship Crystal.
[01:44:49.721 --> 01:44:51.022]  We love commies.
[01:44:51.322 --> 01:44:52.662]  We love commies.
[01:44:52.942 --> 01:44:54.783]  We love value-added taxes.
[01:44:55.143 --> 01:44:57.783]  We love every- Oh, Sarah Palin believes in global warming.
[01:44:57.823 --> 01:44:58.603]  We love you.
[01:44:58.924 --> 01:45:00.484]  Alex Jones is bad, though.
[01:45:00.784 --> 01:45:01.704]  He's a liberal.
[01:45:02.864 --> 01:45:04.145]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:45:04.185 --> 01:45:13.167]  The main guys in the PNAC movement, or the PNAC project, Cheney, Wolfowitz, and Rumsfeld, they're, you know, they're the well-known ones.
[01:45:14.110 --> 01:45:16.932]  Well, what I want to know is what happened to Richard Perro.
[01:45:17.232 --> 01:45:18.093]  Nobody talks about him.
[01:45:18.113 --> 01:45:20.755]  Oh, known at the Pentagon as the Prince of Darkness?
[01:45:21.576 --> 01:45:21.776]  Yes.
[01:45:22.697 --> 01:45:31.643]  Because he goes up to people at cocktail parties and has a come-on for women that, you know how many people I've killed, how much power I have?
[01:45:31.663 --> 01:45:38.829]  I think PNAC has a very, very strong tie to the CPS conspiracy of, you know, the child pornography rings.
[01:45:38.929 --> 01:45:39.409]  PNAC?
[01:45:39.469 --> 01:45:41.391]  I mean, PNAC, I appreciate your call.
[01:45:41.411 --> 01:45:42.372]  The whole government does.
[01:45:43.854 --> 01:45:45.776]  Hey Alex, it's a pleasure to speak to you.
[01:45:45.796 --> 01:45:47.357]  I have some notes here I was going through.
[01:45:47.377 --> 01:45:50.540]  First of all, what I heard yesterday about those children in Iraq
[01:46:09.919 --> 01:46:12.802]  Uh, really, really, uh, basically destroyed me.
[01:46:13.022 --> 01:46:15.544]  Uh, I went into basic training in 1979.
[01:46:16.365 --> 01:46:19.508]  I went into flight school in 1986 and became a warrant officer.
[01:46:20.088 --> 01:46:26.614]  And, uh, I got out of the Army in 93 because I saw, uh, what was happening just based on prophecy.
[01:46:27.975 --> 01:46:29.877]  And, uh, I believe in God.
[01:46:29.897 --> 01:46:34.381]  I believe God created this Earth, uh, basically 6,000 years ago.
[01:46:34.441 --> 01:46:35.382]  I believe in Christ.
[01:46:36.323 --> 01:46:36.523]  And, uh,
[01:46:37.045 --> 01:46:48.810]  The only thing I can do right now is pray, Alex, and I just want to offer a prayer with you and I, because whatever two or more bind together, you know, it will be bound in heaven.
[01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:50.311]  Well, yeah, absolutely.
[01:46:50.331 --> 01:46:54.253]  You can offer the prayer and we're pleased to have that here, but specifically, though,
[01:46:55.526 --> 01:46:56.947]  People say, well, this is just war.
[01:46:57.107 --> 01:47:00.888]  Yeah, this is these aggressive wars that are like video games.
[01:47:00.908 --> 01:47:08.632]  We're going to compare the chopper footage to a video game that people are being conditioned with coming up in the next hour, some video and audio of that to educate people.
[01:47:09.072 --> 01:47:10.493]  But this is the dehumanization.
[01:47:10.533 --> 01:47:12.434]  This is what they see as normal now.
[01:47:13.234 --> 01:47:19.440]  When it totally violates the rules of war and dehumanizes our soldiers, and then they say, we'll support the troops.
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:21.061]  You've got to never criticize what's happening.
[01:47:21.402 --> 01:47:22.042]  I'm a citizen.
[01:47:22.082 --> 01:47:26.967]  I have a right to criticize these illegal wars based on fraudulent WMDs.
[01:47:27.347 --> 01:47:30.730]  I know it's not manly and cool to be into mass murder and death and darkness.
[01:47:31.491 --> 01:47:33.654]  And I know the troops are being used up.
[01:47:33.694 --> 01:47:35.476]  I mean, in Vietnam, maybe two tours.
[01:47:35.556 --> 01:47:36.817]  World War II, one tour.
[01:47:37.358 --> 01:47:39.140]  And most of those guys had mental problems.
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:40.241]  Four, five, six.
[01:47:40.702 --> 01:47:42.804]  Some doing seven tours now.
[01:47:43.405 --> 01:47:45.527]  They know they're destroying the troops mentally.
[01:47:45.867 --> 01:47:46.969]  That's what they want to do.
[01:47:47.409 --> 01:47:50.030]  So, abusing troops is now patriotism.
[01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:52.070]  Illegal wars is now patriotism.
[01:47:52.090 --> 01:47:52.630]  No, it's not.
[01:47:52.730 --> 01:47:53.431]  It's a fraud.
[01:47:53.651 --> 01:48:01.793]  And you've got these people that put themselves up on a high horse, on a mental power trip, like they're the moral people, and anyone against their criminal wars is bad.
[01:48:02.013 --> 01:48:04.094]  They just set the parameters in their own mind.
[01:48:04.174 --> 01:48:07.815]  No, they are engaged in delusions and evil.
[01:48:07.835 --> 01:48:08.235]  Go ahead.
[01:48:09.275 --> 01:48:16.777]  Well, the one thing I can think about, Alex, is that we're going to see troubles that the Earth has never seen before in its history.
[01:48:17.401 --> 01:48:22.686]  And that the only reason that it's going to stop is because Christ is going to come back and stop it.
[01:48:23.066 --> 01:48:25.668]  Otherwise, we would destroy the whole planet.
[01:48:25.688 --> 01:48:26.248]  Let me ask you this.
[01:48:26.268 --> 01:48:29.952]  Do you believe it's our job to stand up against evil, though, or not just wait for Jesus?
[01:48:30.872 --> 01:48:32.374]  Oh, absolutely, Alex.
[01:48:32.654 --> 01:48:33.194]  And you know what?
[01:48:33.495 --> 01:48:38.719]  The only way I can stand up against evil is to bind myself
[01:48:39.375 --> 01:48:40.556]  With the powers of heaven.
[01:48:40.836 --> 01:48:43.498]  The angels that are watching everything that is going on.
[01:48:43.518 --> 01:48:51.544]  And believe me, Alex, they're ready to come back to this earth with... But when you bind yourself with the powers of heaven, do you then feel an uncontrollable urge to face down corruption?
[01:48:52.504 --> 01:48:54.346]  I absolutely do, Alex.
[01:48:54.466 --> 01:48:58.108]  And really... Alex, I witnessed crimes yesterday.
[01:48:58.128 --> 01:49:02.572]  I swore to uphold the Constitution.
[01:49:02.952 --> 01:49:04.473]  And I witnessed crimes yesterday.
[01:49:05.366 --> 01:49:06.547]  I had to plug my ears, Alex.
[01:49:06.607 --> 01:49:08.367]  I could not watch the video.
[01:49:08.447 --> 01:49:16.131]  We have Tony Schafer coming on next week, Black Ops Colonel, and he's saying it violated all the rules and looks like it's illegal as well.
[01:49:16.671 --> 01:49:18.432]  Alex, who do I report the crimes to?
[01:49:18.492 --> 01:49:21.833]  The only people I can report the crimes to right now I know of are you.
[01:49:21.853 --> 01:49:22.853]  You've already presented it.
[01:49:22.893 --> 01:49:27.755]  Well, tell somebody who worked on helicopters and was in and around this why it's a crime.
[01:49:29.596 --> 01:49:30.316]  Why it's a crime?
[01:49:30.356 --> 01:49:32.897]  Because you have to... Well, first of all,
[01:49:35.247 --> 01:49:45.415]  If you engage the enemy, you do not engage children, innocent children, in an ambulance with taking wounded away.
[01:49:45.655 --> 01:49:46.276]  That's number one.
[01:49:46.296 --> 01:49:47.697]  That's the only thing I have to say.
[01:49:48.037 --> 01:49:49.138]  That's a war crime right there.
[01:49:49.338 --> 01:49:50.559]  And you don't torture children.
[01:49:50.699 --> 01:49:54.101]  Six, twelve year old children, you don't torture children, Alex.
[01:49:54.582 --> 01:49:56.083]  I was never taught that when I went through the
[01:49:56.431 --> 01:49:57.212]  The military might.
[01:49:57.532 --> 01:50:01.936]  My drill sergeant came back from Vietnam and I respected that man immensely.
[01:50:02.156 --> 01:50:04.658]  He never taught us to abuse prisoners.
[01:50:04.938 --> 01:50:11.984]  More than that, he was always looked down on and people got in trouble for giggling and laughing and making light of killing people.
[01:50:12.384 --> 01:50:14.265]  I mean, there's also the enjoyment of it.
[01:50:14.345 --> 01:50:18.248]  None of the old vets I ever talked to said that it was good to enjoy it.
[01:50:18.508 --> 01:50:23.811]  They said there was always a few guys that were sick, but more and more they're promoting the people that giggle.
[01:50:24.091 --> 01:50:29.274]  Did you hear me playing the video and audio of the guy making demonic pleasure noises while they were beating children?
[01:50:29.694 --> 01:50:31.595]  Alex, I had to put my fingers in my ears.
[01:50:31.675 --> 01:50:34.597]  I came back to turn the radio down and I had to put my fingers in my ears.
[01:50:34.677 --> 01:50:35.258]  I swear.
[01:50:35.278 --> 01:50:36.198]  I swear.
[01:50:36.218 --> 01:50:38.900]  Well, you know that was literally a demon you were hearing.
[01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:40.801]  Alex, I know.
[01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:43.261]  We're in some serious trouble.
[01:50:43.281 --> 01:50:47.705]  Well, stay there, stay there, and we'll hear your prayer when we come back on the other side of the break.
[01:50:47.825 --> 01:50:53.891]  And I got a little grumpy coming into this segment because, I mean, this isn't a joke, folks, and I'm sick of having to focus on this stuff.
[01:50:54.251 --> 01:50:56.834]  But if more people would get up off their butts, we could turn this around.
[01:50:57.415 --> 01:50:58.496]  A lot of news coming up.
[01:50:58.536 --> 01:50:59.156]  Your phone call.
[01:50:59.176 --> 01:50:59.597]  Stay with us.
[01:51:02.298 --> 01:51:05.459]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[01:51:05.679 --> 01:51:13.702]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[01:51:13.863 --> 01:51:18.985]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[01:51:19.185 --> 01:51:22.066]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.
[01:51:22.166 --> 01:51:25.027]  Visit us at crossbreedholsters.com.
[01:51:26.067 --> 01:51:29.269]  Don't forget, crossbreedholsters.com.
[01:51:30.649 --> 01:51:31.730]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:36.293]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:51:36.453 --> 01:51:42.177]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:51:42.277 --> 01:51:45.699]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:51:45.919 --> 01:51:48.521]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:51:48.641 --> 01:51:53.544]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:51:53.704 --> 01:51:53.925]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:51:53.945 --> 01:51:55.346]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:03.430]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:52:03.490 --> 01:52:05.711]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:52:05.831 --> 01:52:08.652]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:52:09.032 --> 01:52:13.774]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:52:14.134 --> 01:52:18.316]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:52:18.636 --> 01:52:20.997]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:52:21.097 --> 01:52:23.539]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:52:23.879 --> 01:52:26.461]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:52:26.801 --> 01:52:34.365]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:52:34.725 --> 01:52:39.989]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:52:40.109 --> 01:52:42.391]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:52:42.431 --> 01:52:46.394]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:52:46.654 --> 01:52:47.574]  And I got news for you.
[01:52:47.735 --> 01:52:48.935]  You're everyone else.
[01:52:49.076 --> 01:52:50.056]  Invisible Empire.

[01:53:00.273 --> 01:53:03.454]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:53:03.814 --> 01:53:05.654]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:53:06.095 --> 01:53:06.515]  Don't!
[01:53:06.975 --> 01:53:09.996]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:53:10.416 --> 01:53:19.178]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[01:53:19.498 --> 01:53:23.159]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:53:23.559 --> 01:53:26.302]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:53:26.703 --> 01:53:33.751]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:53:34.091 --> 01:53:35.092]  Herb K was right.
[01:53:35.272 --> 01:53:38.316]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:53:38.476 --> 01:53:39.497]  What have you got to lose?
[01:53:39.897 --> 01:53:40.879]  Stop the calls now!
[01:53:41.179 --> 01:53:42.881]  Get out of debt and have more money!
[01:53:43.181 --> 01:53:43.862]  Get Herb K.'
[01:53:43.762 --> 01:53:46.264]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now!
[01:53:46.424 --> 01:53:46.785]  Call 800-822-1291.
[01:53:47.085 --> 01:53:47.606]  That's 800-822-1291.
[01:53:47.626 --> 01:53:47.666]  800-822-1291.
[01:54:02.119 --> 01:54:07.265]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:07.946 --> 01:54:10.289]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:11.070 --> 01:54:11.590]  There is!
[01:54:11.630 --> 01:54:12.532]  Here's what's gonna happen.
[01:54:12.632 --> 01:54:16.577]  We've taken video of the chopper attack.
[01:54:18.010 --> 01:54:20.592]  And we've cut it into video games to show the conditioning.
[01:54:20.793 --> 01:54:22.874]  Matt Ryan and Jason Douglas have done this.
[01:54:23.715 --> 01:54:31.062]  Matt Ryan's actually a video game reviewer and I'm going to go back to a review of the game we're going to be playing side-by-side later in the next hour towards the end of the show.
[01:54:31.823 --> 01:54:33.144]  I do have a bunch of news I want to get to.
[01:54:33.164 --> 01:54:44.054]  We're going to get to Daryl, Ken, Jim, Tyler, Chris, Ray, Chris, Scott, Mike, and a few other callers over here like Tim and others.
[01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:50.551]  The problem is the callers are all great callers and it goes on for like five minutes per caller and we never have time to finish up or get to the news.
[01:54:51.152 --> 01:54:56.074]  But I want to cover the value-added tax, all being announced by Obama, Republicans supporting it, we're in deep trouble.
[01:54:57.534 --> 01:54:58.675]  Real fast, I've got to move on.
[01:54:58.695 --> 01:55:00.276]  Go ahead and say your prayer.
[01:55:01.276 --> 01:55:01.796]  Go ahead.
[01:55:03.257 --> 01:55:04.077]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:55:04.257 --> 01:55:07.519]  Heavenly Father, the only thing I can think about doing is praying to you.
[01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:14.525]  And just asking that you would sear the minds of those people that would torture those children and make them stop.
[01:55:14.885 --> 01:55:15.866]  Just sear their minds.
[01:55:16.567 --> 01:55:35.321]  And give all Christians, I believe in Christ, give all Christians that power to pray, get away from the television, concentrate on spiritual things, leave the material things behind, concentrate on that government in heaven that is soon to come to this earth, and cast judgment.
[01:55:36.455 --> 01:55:42.944]  It's a reality, and just give us all the strength to face that reality, stand for good, and stand against evil.
[01:55:43.224 --> 01:55:44.886]  And in Jesus' name, I believe in Jesus.
[01:55:45.447 --> 01:55:45.727]  Amen.
[01:55:46.048 --> 01:55:46.488]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:55:46.909 --> 01:55:48.351]  Amen, and I appreciate your call.
[01:55:48.391 --> 01:55:50.454]  God bless you, and I would just add to that prayer that
[01:55:53.007 --> 01:55:56.170]  Not just sear their minds, but wake them up, like Saul of Tarsus.
[01:55:56.190 --> 01:56:03.116]  He hunted down and killed Christians and did horrible things and tortured people, and God raised him up as one of the great leaders against evil.
[01:56:03.857 --> 01:56:12.085]  I mean, I don't even want to hate these people, but I feel sorry for them, folks, because I don't fear he who can kill the body, I fear he who can kill the soul.
[01:56:13.306 --> 01:56:15.588]  And that's why I'm not afraid of the New World Order.
[01:56:15.748 --> 01:56:16.689]  I know who I am.
[01:56:16.729 --> 01:56:17.770]  I know what side I'm on.
[01:56:17.790 --> 01:56:21.933]  And it feels good in my spirit to know I'm not giving over to evil.
[01:56:22.413 --> 01:56:23.334]  Does that mean I'm perfect?
[01:56:23.374 --> 01:56:23.514]  No.
[01:56:23.574 --> 01:56:26.497]  Every day I feel the world trying to turn me towards it.
[01:56:26.837 --> 01:56:27.798]  And we all fall down.
[01:56:27.858 --> 01:56:30.260]  But the thing is, my heart is good.
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:31.180]  And I love God.
[01:56:32.041 --> 01:56:33.282]  And that's the most important thing.
[01:56:36.463 --> 01:56:39.744]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors we've got before we start the final hour.
[01:56:40.364 --> 01:56:45.445]  Coloblue is running a special free shipping, they do this once a month, on all the Coloblues.
[01:56:46.625 --> 01:56:55.707]  30s, that's their medium-sized unit, grabs the water out of the air, purifies it, goes through 12 filters, hot, cold water, it's got it all, cleanest, best water you can get out there.
[01:56:56.347 --> 01:56:57.828]  International orders receive 100 U.S.
[01:56:58.668 --> 01:56:59.328]  dollar credit.
[01:57:00.954 --> 01:57:04.341]  And this is running through April 9th.
[01:57:04.982 --> 01:57:08.008]  So from today through, I guess that's Saturday.
[01:57:09.445 --> 01:57:12.168]  It's one thing to own a bunch of guns.
[01:57:35.691 --> 01:57:36.993]  It's another thing to know how to use them.
[01:57:37.153 --> 01:57:39.256]  Handguns, shotguns, rifles.
[01:57:39.496 --> 01:57:41.238]  They've got two-day, four-day, five-day training.
[01:57:41.258 --> 01:57:44.903]  They've got a five-day handgun training course that's super high quality.
[01:57:45.244 --> 01:57:46.946]  No drill instructor or traffic guy attitude.
[01:57:46.966 --> 01:57:48.588]  Incredibly inexpensive.
[01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:51.171]  Frontsight.com, like the front of your rifle.
[01:57:51.492 --> 01:57:52.513]  Frontsight.com.
[01:57:53.194 --> 01:58:00.199]  And if you act fast, the owner, Dr. Ignatius Piazza, will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:58:00.339 --> 01:58:00.899]  Great deal.
[01:58:01.259 --> 01:58:02.800]  Frontsight.com.
[01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:06.663]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot C-O-M.
[01:58:06.723 --> 01:58:08.244]  Frontsight.com.
[01:58:08.604 --> 01:58:11.986]  Definitely check those great sponsors out today.
[01:58:13.487 --> 01:58:14.568]  Okay, this is what we're going to do.
[01:58:15.563 --> 01:58:17.904]  I'm going to come back and give each caller one minute.
[01:58:18.084 --> 01:58:19.945]  And I'm not even going to have time to respond.
[01:58:20.065 --> 01:58:21.866]  Or if you have a question fired out, I'll answer it.
[01:58:22.306 --> 01:58:23.187]  I'm moving to the next person.
[01:58:23.207 --> 01:58:25.988]  I'm going to go through these two phone boards.
[01:58:26.648 --> 01:58:29.750]  The Genesis phones and our phones.
[01:58:30.370 --> 01:58:33.472]  And it looks to be about 12, 13 callers we've got up on the board.
[01:58:33.972 --> 01:58:36.693]  We're going to go to you, and then I'm going to get into news.
[01:58:37.314 --> 01:58:39.234]  For The Balance, key information coming up.
[01:58:39.254 --> 01:58:39.755]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.236 --> 01:58:43.537]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.454 --> 01:58:47.686]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:58:52.352 --> 01:58:55.975]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:58:56.315 --> 01:59:04.442]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:59:05.182 --> 01:59:09.225]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:59:09.806 --> 01:59:20.635]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.

[01:59:43.686 --> 01:59:46.427]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:59:53.422 --> 01:59:55.346]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.807 --> 01:59:58.572]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.348 --> 02:00:14.351]  We are back live already, the fourth and final hour of this Wednesday, April 7th, 2010 edition.
[02:00:14.431 --> 02:00:19.673]  I'm going to blitz through your calls, and then I'm getting into a bunch of NARC news.
[02:00:19.753 --> 02:00:28.956]  The IRS boosting the amount of cash bonuses, upwards of 25% of whatever is taken for ratting on your neighbors, your bosses, lying about them.
[02:00:29.436 --> 02:00:31.497]  Dallas-based NARC Technologies Inc.
[02:00:31.557 --> 02:00:33.557]  pays people to rat out their neighbors.
[02:00:33.597 --> 02:00:34.738]  That's out of MSNBC.
[02:00:35.618 --> 02:00:41.423]  Then I'm going to get into all the new taxes Obama has passed or is passing, including stealth taxes.
[02:00:41.863 --> 02:00:46.707]  Volcker, his chief economist, says carbon taxes, VAT, should be on the table.
[02:00:47.247 --> 02:00:51.470]  That is just some of what is coming up in this hour.
[02:00:51.570 --> 02:00:55.053]  Also, I'm going to play video for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, audio for the listeners.
[02:00:55.393 --> 02:00:57.835]  This will be posted on our YouTube channel later today.
[02:00:57.875 --> 02:00:59.497]  In fact, it's being uploaded right now.
[02:01:00.745 --> 02:01:09.890]  PrisonPlanet.tv, folks will see it first, integrating Call of Duty, one of these shoot-em-up, kill-em games, with the footage of the massacre in Iraq.
[02:01:10.570 --> 02:01:15.193]  The women, the children, the Reuters reporters, to show how we're being desensitized and conditioned.
[02:01:15.213 --> 02:01:20.196]  And that's what video games were developed for by the Pentagon more than 30 years ago, was instinctive shooting.
[02:01:20.936 --> 02:01:22.316]  to develop the killer instinct.
[02:01:22.376 --> 02:01:25.077]  If you don't shoot, then you will be dead marine.
[02:01:25.117 --> 02:01:27.017]  Well, now it's kill the kids or you'll be dead marine.
[02:01:27.378 --> 02:01:28.498]  So that is coming up.
[02:01:28.518 --> 02:01:31.779]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls on the Genesis board.
[02:01:32.139 --> 02:01:33.859]  Let's talk to Eric in Georgia.
[02:01:33.879 --> 02:01:34.799]  You're on the air, Eric.
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:37.000]  Hey, brother, how you doing?
[02:01:37.380 --> 02:01:37.980]  I'm doing OK.
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:44.582]  OK, well, number one, I did serve in between 95 and 2000.
[02:01:46.282 --> 02:01:48.183]  I've seen the best that man can be.
[02:01:48.203 --> 02:01:49.863]  I've seen the worst that man can be.
[02:01:51.272 --> 02:01:53.594]  And the best far outweighs the worst.
[02:01:55.235 --> 02:02:04.764]  Do not judge the soldiers, because in a hole, the good will outweigh the bad.
[02:02:06.686 --> 02:02:07.707]  I mean, it really will.
[02:02:09.649 --> 02:02:14.273]  We, as a nation, are good.
[02:02:16.041 --> 02:02:17.262]  As a people, we're good.
[02:02:17.862 --> 02:02:24.224]  Well, I agree with you, but don't we need to criticize torture and shooting up people, picking up wounded who are unarmed?
[02:02:25.084 --> 02:02:27.165]  Alex, I agree with you completely.
[02:02:28.146 --> 02:02:34.788]  I'm not going to go into what I would do to those boys that did what I've seen on the video you posted yesterday.
[02:02:37.629 --> 02:02:41.951]  But, as a general rule,
[02:02:43.846 --> 02:02:44.406]  I'm a Ranger.
[02:02:44.426 --> 02:02:46.868]  I got a tattoo on my shoulder that says Ranger.
[02:02:47.668 --> 02:02:48.168]  You feel me?
[02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:50.669]  These guys are good.
[02:02:50.689 --> 02:02:51.930]  They want to do good.
[02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:54.932]  They want to bring good to people.
[02:02:55.072 --> 02:02:56.212]  They don't want to hurt people.
[02:02:56.532 --> 02:02:57.233]  I understand that.
[02:02:57.313 --> 02:02:58.814]  I'm not saying troops are bad.
[02:02:58.834 --> 02:03:01.415]  A lot of my family's in the military or been in the military.
[02:03:01.455 --> 02:03:02.155]  I'm from Texas.
[02:03:02.796 --> 02:03:05.177]  But the point is that
[02:03:06.388 --> 02:03:09.711]  The war was based on a lie.
[02:03:09.971 --> 02:03:15.835]  Our government put Saddam Hussein in to begin with and then set him up and basically told him go ahead and go into Kuwait.
[02:03:16.416 --> 02:03:21.480]  My whole point is, is they use... I mean look at how they're making people do two, three, four, five tours now.
[02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:22.380]  They've never done that before.
[02:03:22.701 --> 02:03:25.082]  Look at how they're trying to take the vets' health care away.
[02:03:25.303 --> 02:03:26.644]  They don't care about you either.
[02:03:26.964 --> 02:03:30.507]  Supporting the troops means not putting them in illegal wars.
[02:03:31.527 --> 02:03:32.568]  You're absolutely right.
[02:03:32.848 --> 02:03:35.771]  And these guys, these kids are
[02:03:37.728 --> 02:03:43.372]  I'm going to let you go.
[02:03:43.392 --> 02:03:44.392]  I appreciate your call.
[02:03:47.555 --> 02:03:52.498]  I understand a lot of people are angry and upset out there with some of the things that are going on.
[02:03:52.518 --> 02:03:53.699]  I understand your frustration.
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:56.381]  Let's talk to Tim in Michigan.
[02:03:56.401 --> 02:03:57.201]  Tim, you're on the air.
[02:03:57.982 --> 02:03:59.803]  Hey Alex, how you doing today, buddy?
[02:04:00.143 --> 02:04:00.584]  Pretty good.
[02:04:01.324 --> 02:04:02.025]  Okay, listen.
[02:04:02.992 --> 02:04:23.405]  I pull up my Yahoo newsroom every morning when I jump online, and the first article that was on there, and this actually was a very good, I think, feather in our cap as far as the un-mainstream media being effective.
[02:04:23.465 --> 02:04:31.450]  The headline read, leaked video shows civilian killings in Iraq signifies growing power of independent web journalism.
[02:04:32.165 --> 02:04:40.632]  And that's coming from, obviously, mainstream media sources that are... I take that as a plug to us and people like us and our cause.
[02:04:41.172 --> 02:04:53.882]  And I just thought that was... it kind of made me feel good to see that these people are finally seeing the significance of and the power that we have as a people on this level to change things.
[02:04:54.482 --> 02:04:55.023]  Awesome!
[02:04:56.545 --> 02:04:57.466]  Awesome phone call.
[02:04:57.486 --> 02:04:58.467]  Appreciate the call.
[02:04:58.487 --> 02:04:59.668]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:59.788 --> 02:05:04.552]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:05:04.732 --> 02:05:05.653]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:05.993 --> 02:05:09.596]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:09.616 --> 02:05:12.138]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.158 --> 02:05:17.622]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:18.043 --> 02:05:24.288]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:24.688 --> 02:05:30.230]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:30.630 --> 02:05:34.351]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:05:34.851 --> 02:05:38.832]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:39.112 --> 02:05:44.654]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.074 --> 02:05:48.035]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.615 --> 02:05:50.036]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.596 --> 02:05:51.036]  It's here.

[02:06:07.463 --> 02:06:12.225]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:12.605 --> 02:06:19.308]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:21.345 --> 02:06:27.721]  They sow pride in every stage Guarantee you love the way they feel
[02:06:29.687 --> 02:06:33.710]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:06:34.431 --> 02:06:37.613]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[02:06:38.234 --> 02:06:39.075]  Others don't.
[02:06:39.495 --> 02:06:41.376]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:41.637 --> 02:06:43.138]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:43.418 --> 02:06:45.980]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:06:55.648 --> 02:06:57.670]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[02:06:58.010 --> 02:06:58.891]  Others don't.
[02:07:00.885 --> 02:07:03.487]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:03.888 --> 02:07:08.852]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.212 --> 02:07:10.954]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.274 --> 02:07:16.078]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.279 --> 02:07:17.239]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.460 --> 02:07:18.200]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.581 --> 02:07:20.182]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.462 --> 02:07:21.283]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.543 --> 02:07:23.605]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.745 --> 02:07:24.846]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.086 --> 02:07:26.428]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.608 --> 02:07:26.968]  If there's a
[02:07:27.008 --> 02:07:28.969]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[02:07:29.129 --> 02:07:31.651]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:31.851 --> 02:07:35.053]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.433 --> 02:07:38.955]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.255 --> 02:07:40.236]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.496 --> 02:07:41.097]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.397 --> 02:07:42.297]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.497 --> 02:07:43.198]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.558 --> 02:07:44.258]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.498 --> 02:07:47.279]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:54.842]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:55.102 --> 02:07:57.363]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:57.903 --> 02:08:08.307]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:08.908 --> 02:08:11.909]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.898 --> 02:08:23.291]  Coming up at about 40 after, in the last 20 minutes of the show, I'm going to play a 6-minute clip of Call of Duty, one of the most successful video games, what they sold.
[02:08:25.453 --> 02:08:28.497]  $600 million worth of it in the last few months, the news reported.
[02:08:29.924 --> 02:08:40.597]  Just, you know, hundreds of thousands of copies, very expensive, where it shows people killing dogs for fun, torturing people for fun, and then we cut to real military videos of it actually happening.
[02:08:40.917 --> 02:08:48.005]  And these games, like Doom, 15 years ago, was designed for the Pentagon to cause instinctive shooting.
[02:08:48.846 --> 02:08:50.747]  It's a high-tech version of pop-up targets.
[02:08:51.207 --> 02:08:53.088]  One pops up with a woman with a baby, you don't shoot.
[02:08:53.428 --> 02:08:56.429]  One pops up with a bad guy with a mask on, you shoot.
[02:08:56.949 --> 02:09:05.133]  But now in these games, this game's got false flag terror, where they go into an airport and shoot up a bunch of people to blame it on terrorists.
[02:09:05.533 --> 02:09:06.193]  It's got it all.
[02:09:06.433 --> 02:09:09.214]  So we're going to play this coming up.
[02:09:09.254 --> 02:09:11.675]  Great job, Jason Douglas and Matt Ryan.
[02:09:11.715 --> 02:09:13.456]  And Matt Ryan wrote a review of the game.
[02:09:14.935 --> 02:09:20.319]  On his site, DailyPWN.com, Call of Duty series riddled with controversy.
[02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:23.222]  We need to write another article today if you want to get it up with the YouTube.
[02:09:23.262 --> 02:09:24.663]  We're going to put this on YouTube later.
[02:09:27.506 --> 02:09:34.692]  Right now, let's go back to your phone calls, and I'm going to get into the value-added tax, the carbon tax that they're now pushing, and they have conservatives pushing it as well.
[02:09:34.812 --> 02:09:35.672]  Very, very dangerous.
[02:09:35.712 --> 02:09:36.413]  Very, very scary.
[02:09:36.453 --> 02:09:39.555]  And we're going to talk about some snitch culture information as well.
[02:09:39.835 --> 02:09:41.237]  But I'm going to race through your calls now.
[02:09:41.337 --> 02:09:44.859]  Have your points ready, folks, because I'm going to go to you one after the other.
[02:09:45.140 --> 02:09:46.621]  Daryl in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[02:09:48.142 --> 02:09:49.083]  Yeah, Alex, great show.
[02:09:49.363 --> 02:09:49.923]  Great interview.
[02:09:50.984 --> 02:09:57.129]  And I just wanted to invite some people here in Bartlett, Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee area, the Bartlett police.
[02:09:57.868 --> 02:10:05.794]  And a lot of departments give them seized cars and let them use it as their own, which is a form of booty.
[02:10:26.269 --> 02:10:26.790]  Right, right.
[02:10:26.910 --> 02:10:34.697]  And that was my next point, was one of these SUVs actually has the little stick figure family that you see on the back of vehicles sometimes.
[02:10:34.737 --> 02:10:36.539]  The mom, the dad, the kids, all in hands.
[02:10:36.899 --> 02:10:38.400]  One of the vehicles actually has that on it.
[02:10:38.481 --> 02:10:40.783]  And it's just, it's out of control now.
[02:10:41.804 --> 02:10:45.027]  It's just like... Everything is converting to secret police.
[02:10:46.621 --> 02:10:47.122]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:10:47.463 --> 02:10:51.289]  And one other thing, how do you combat CPS?
[02:10:51.730 --> 02:10:57.601]  I had an experience with CPS where it's true, they will frame you, they will say things that aren't true.
[02:10:58.485 --> 02:11:08.997]  If you question their authority, I recently, honestly, was set up, I've got the letter to prove it, or they're trying to lay a path, and I'm a poor parent.
[02:11:10.499 --> 02:11:11.140]  Where do I go?
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:18.808]  Well, there are a lot of different homeschooler associations and associations that have lawyers that we've had on many times that document the tactics.
[02:11:19.389 --> 02:11:21.131]  The biggest thing is don't have them in public school.
[02:11:21.151 --> 02:11:22.312]  That's where they hunt your kids.
[02:11:22.712 --> 02:11:23.853]  That's where they make stuff up.
[02:11:24.354 --> 02:11:26.776]  But they've bankrupted most people who they have to be in public school.
[02:11:26.816 --> 02:11:31.700]  You teach your kids not to talk to the authorities, not to trust them, to keep their mouths shut.
[02:11:32.641 --> 02:11:36.024]  They're there to take them away from Mommy and Daddy and how bad these people are.
[02:11:36.205 --> 02:11:37.466]  That's what our forefathers did.
[02:11:37.766 --> 02:11:39.107]  We've lost that common sense.
[02:11:40.028 --> 02:11:42.510]  And you don't answer the door the first time they show up.
[02:11:43.451 --> 02:11:44.012]  I don't know.
[02:12:05.149 --> 02:12:07.431]  Yeah, another quick bit of info real quick.
[02:12:24.834 --> 02:12:31.343]  I heard the lady, I don't know, senator, congresswoman, that was shot and her husband killed as well.
[02:12:31.663 --> 02:12:33.045]  Yeah, the evidence is they were murdered.
[02:12:33.085 --> 02:12:38.993]  She was exposing in Georgia child kidnapping rings and about to bring out a lot of info that her and her husband were killed.
[02:12:39.634 --> 02:12:40.535]  Thank you for the call, Daryl.
[02:12:40.555 --> 02:12:41.917]  Let's talk to Ken in Ohio.
[02:12:41.957 --> 02:12:42.638]  Ken, you're on the air.
[02:12:44.204 --> 02:12:45.244]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:12:45.765 --> 02:12:46.425]  I'm doing alright.
[02:12:46.445 --> 02:12:47.125]  Good to hear.
[02:12:47.285 --> 02:12:52.647]  You know, I always wondered why they wouldn't kill you, but you know, it's because we all love you so much.
[02:12:52.927 --> 02:12:57.148]  You do such a great job, and they know how much you've pissed off the American people that are awake.
[02:12:57.208 --> 02:12:58.129]  Well, it's more than that.
[02:12:58.269 --> 02:13:03.050]  They would underline, highlight, and put an exclamation point on everything I've ever said if they killed me.
[02:13:03.330 --> 02:13:11.313]  They'd rather just destroy me, and that's why Media Matters, George Soros' outfit, well, I'm going to cover this coming up, but go ahead.
[02:13:12.193 --> 02:13:12.493]  Okay.
[02:13:13.414 --> 02:13:30.412]  I had a situation in Cleveland, Ohio, where the guardian at Lyttom was actually mob-related, and his father was trying to basically loan shark me money while he was trying to take my kids away for taking them to paintball.
[02:13:31.161 --> 02:13:36.306]  They took pictures of all the bruises on the kids from playing paintball at 13 years old.
[02:13:36.446 --> 02:13:40.951]  Oh, they're taking people's kids now that get bruised in Little League football or baseball.
[02:13:41.711 --> 02:13:48.838]  And I've seen the court cases where the 7-year-old has a softball, give them a black eye that we all got, and they say, we don't care.
[02:13:49.239 --> 02:13:50.080]  It's your fault.
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:51.221]  We're taking your kids.
[02:13:51.581 --> 02:13:56.143]  They had bruises on them, but they played paintball for like over three hours at 13 years old.
[02:13:56.183 --> 02:13:57.723]  I'd be amazed if they came out without a bruise.
[02:13:57.743 --> 02:13:58.663]  They're supposed to get bruises.
[02:13:58.703 --> 02:14:02.765]  Listen, I know wealthy yuppies who come crying to me over and over again.
[02:14:03.145 --> 02:14:05.866]  At a public park, their kid falls off and breaks a finger.
[02:14:06.386 --> 02:14:07.747]  They don't care if they have witnesses.
[02:14:07.787 --> 02:14:08.527]  They try to take them.
[02:14:08.807 --> 02:14:10.527]  The government is hunting our children.
[02:14:10.888 --> 02:14:11.728]  They are hunting them.
[02:14:12.828 --> 02:14:16.510]  And people that just joined us, I read a bunch of articles from Chicago Tribune, you name it.
[02:14:16.951 --> 02:14:20.993]  Read the congressional record where Dyncor and Halliburton are running child kidnapping rings.
[02:14:21.193 --> 02:14:22.314]  They run the CPS.
[02:14:22.614 --> 02:14:24.195]  I mean, you cannot make this up.
[02:14:24.215 --> 02:14:25.275]  It's so incredible.
[02:14:26.116 --> 02:14:28.157]  I tell you, Alex, though, I just took these guys...
[02:14:29.099 --> 02:14:31.960]  to federal court and I beat him in a federal RICO case.
[02:14:32.060 --> 02:14:32.920]  It can be done.
[02:14:33.581 --> 02:14:41.284]  Well, also, you start following a CPS worker, which you can just start a blog, say it's a news event, they're all involved in crime.
[02:14:41.304 --> 02:14:45.465]  I mean, you follow them one time, you'll catch them going to a crack house.
[02:14:45.845 --> 02:14:52.908]  You follow them one time, you'll catch them taking kids out of the government custody to their rape rooms with their friends.
[02:14:53.008 --> 02:14:56.569]  You follow them one time, they're all that are evil.
[02:14:56.929 --> 02:14:57.870]  If it's evil ones that are
[02:14:58.775 --> 02:14:59.556]  Lying about you.
[02:14:59.616 --> 02:15:03.379]  They're only criminals do this and you will always catch them.
[02:15:03.780 --> 02:15:07.343]  Okay, I've sent people to prison in Austin in the city government.
[02:15:07.743 --> 02:15:10.946]  Like the head of Access TV.
[02:15:11.266 --> 02:15:12.047]  I knew they were corrupt.
[02:15:12.067 --> 02:15:12.928]  I started following them.
[02:15:12.968 --> 02:15:13.809]  I started recording them.
[02:15:14.329 --> 02:15:17.051]  And he just got out of the pen five years later, four years later.
[02:15:17.071 --> 02:15:18.212]  I'm telling you.
[02:15:18.252 --> 02:15:19.213]  I mean, I go to the Capitol.
[02:15:19.253 --> 02:15:22.176]  I catch bribery and the whole committee gets overturned.
[02:15:22.296 --> 02:15:23.476]  I mean, they're all criminal.
[02:15:23.536 --> 02:15:24.817]  Cash, grabbing, money.
[02:15:25.797 --> 02:15:27.098]  You cannot imagine the evil.
[02:15:27.338 --> 02:15:30.799]  You scratch the surface of government, pus just spews out.
[02:15:31.159 --> 02:15:33.820]  I mean, it's like a rotten house with termites.
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:38.222]  You pull off any board, it looks fine, there's termites crawling around, roaches everywhere.
[02:15:38.242 --> 02:15:39.542]  I mean, I'm telling you.
[02:15:39.762 --> 02:15:41.423]  But good, I'm glad you kicked their butt.
[02:15:41.763 --> 02:15:43.063]  God bless you, good to hear from you.
[02:15:43.823 --> 02:15:44.604]  Who's up next here?
[02:15:44.624 --> 02:15:47.745]  Who's hearing these stories from these people?
[02:15:48.925 --> 02:15:50.468]  Bob in California, you're on the air.
[02:16:03.419 --> 02:16:05.000]  Do you know anything about it?
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:06.561]  They haven't been clear about that.
[02:16:06.601 --> 02:16:07.622]  And let's look that up.
[02:16:07.682 --> 02:16:08.843]  Joe Stack's body recovered.
[02:16:08.863 --> 02:16:09.463]  That should pull it up.
[02:16:10.164 --> 02:16:11.565]  They said there were a couple bodies in there.
[02:16:11.605 --> 02:16:12.265]  They weren't clear.
[02:16:12.365 --> 02:16:14.106]  Witnesses all said nobody in the plane.
[02:16:14.126 --> 02:16:15.708]  Emergency crews are there before it happened.
[02:16:15.728 --> 02:16:16.448]  That was later confirmed.
[02:16:16.468 --> 02:16:16.888]  That happened.
[02:16:17.209 --> 02:16:21.432]  He had his tiny hangar with a top Homeland Security remote control aircraft expert.
[02:16:21.472 --> 02:16:22.873]  Joe Stack was tied into black ops.
[02:16:22.913 --> 02:16:23.333]  It's clear.
[02:16:23.673 --> 02:16:26.495]  With bizarre flights into secretive military bases in the past.
[02:16:26.815 --> 02:16:28.036]  The whole manifesto is fake.
[02:16:28.076 --> 02:16:28.837]  His family says it.
[02:16:28.897 --> 02:16:32.019]  It's absolutely staged to kick off a war against the Patriot movement.
[02:16:33.012 --> 02:16:35.321]  I believe that, but I just wonder what happened to his body.
[02:16:35.362 --> 02:16:38.795]  That was my question, if he either had to be...
[02:16:39.392 --> 02:16:41.474]  In the wreckage or not or something.
[02:16:41.714 --> 02:16:44.716]  Well there's KVUE in Austin.
[02:16:45.537 --> 02:16:48.419]  Second body found in Echelon building was Joseph Stack.
[02:16:48.459 --> 02:16:49.120]  There's your answer.
[02:16:49.140 --> 02:16:50.061]  Appreciate your call.
[02:16:50.081 --> 02:16:51.462]  Of course who knows if that's true.
[02:16:52.062 --> 02:16:54.404]  Local news around here says mercury is good for children's brains.
[02:16:54.865 --> 02:16:55.845]  New listeners won't believe it.
[02:16:55.865 --> 02:16:57.186]  Pull up mercury good for children's brains.
[02:16:57.987 --> 02:16:58.567]  Just YouTube it.
[02:16:58.868 --> 02:16:59.168]  Thank you.
[02:16:59.728 --> 02:17:03.051]  Let's go ahead now and go to Nick in Florida.
[02:17:03.111 --> 02:17:03.812]  Nick, you're on the air.
[02:17:04.824 --> 02:17:05.725]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:17:06.305 --> 02:17:07.206]  Welcome!
[02:17:07.586 --> 02:17:10.608]  I've got a couple quick words of caution for the listeners.
[02:17:11.889 --> 02:17:30.241]  One would be that if you're running a blog, as I've had happen to me recently, you may want to look for your comments section, and you may notice that the Trilateral Commission just might be leaving comments on your blog.
[02:17:30.934 --> 02:17:35.797]  Okay, so IP addresses to several cryptic comments that were posted.
[02:17:36.357 --> 02:17:37.077]  Absolutely.
[02:17:37.117 --> 02:17:45.622]  We have thousands of visits a day by government agencies and we can track their IPs and the government's just in there calling for violence 24-7.
[02:17:47.163 --> 02:17:51.805]  And then Media Matters comes out and says I'm calling for violence because they're trying to set me up.
[02:17:51.985 --> 02:17:52.485]  Absolutely.
[02:17:52.505 --> 02:17:53.206]  So that's happened to you?
[02:17:54.178 --> 02:17:55.018]  Yeah, that's happened.
[02:17:55.058 --> 02:18:09.623]  I mean, there were cryptic movie quotes that were sort of threatening, and I traced them back, the IP address using Google, back to the Sakharov Plaza Trilateral Commission building, and so that was a little bit strange, and you may want to look out for that.
[02:18:09.643 --> 02:18:22.828]  And then the other thing that I wanted to just say is that if you're a parent and you're thinking about putting your child on psychotropic drugs, please just consider that if you've never taken it, why on earth would you put it in your child's mouth?
[02:18:23.422 --> 02:18:25.664]  Absolutely, I appreciate the call.
[02:18:25.684 --> 02:18:30.628]  Well, I'm going to get into this Media Matters situation.
[02:18:30.648 --> 02:18:32.429]  I'm trying to go to as many calls as possible here.
[02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:34.031]  Nick in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:18:36.473 --> 02:18:38.334]  Okay, Anton in Detroit, go ahead.
[02:18:38.354 --> 02:18:43.418]  Alright, let them go.
[02:18:43.478 --> 02:18:45.120]  Let's talk to Tony in Chicago.
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:45.500]  Tony?
[02:18:46.681 --> 02:18:49.924]  Hey, greetings from Airstrip 2 here, Alex.
[02:18:52.754 --> 02:18:59.839]  I'll tell you what, I was just going to tell you, I was watching Ed Schultz the other day, my favorite guy on TV.
[02:18:59.919 --> 02:19:02.600]  The guy that says ban free speech in America?
[02:19:02.620 --> 02:19:02.880]  Yeah.
[02:19:04.001 --> 02:19:09.284]  All yesterday was about was different ways to quell free speech on every news network was about.
[02:19:09.825 --> 02:19:12.586]  That's all it was about, but back to what I was saying.
[02:19:13.027 --> 02:19:19.731]  Ed Schultz, and maybe somebody else had this issue, and it wasn't just his show, but every MSNBC show now,
[02:19:20.481 --> 02:19:23.185]  That has a text vote or whatever.
[02:19:23.205 --> 02:19:34.441]  I tried to vote and I started sending votes in when Ron Paul would be on the debates and stuff, of course, and he always won, but now suddenly it says I don't have that service available for my cell phone.
[02:19:36.019 --> 02:19:37.159]  And, uh, I tried it.
[02:19:37.439 --> 02:19:44.101]  Uh, my wife, nobody... Yeah, what they do is they're tracking your IP address, and they know your cookie.
[02:19:44.641 --> 02:19:47.942]  They know that you voted before, so that's how they're rigging polls.
[02:19:47.982 --> 02:19:48.562]  That's come out.
[02:19:49.122 --> 02:19:49.642]  Absolutely.
[02:19:49.662 --> 02:19:50.642]  Appreciate your call.
[02:19:50.702 --> 02:19:53.043]  Look, the government's gone completely rogue and criminal.
[02:19:53.363 --> 02:19:54.123]  No one's safe.
[02:19:54.203 --> 02:19:56.543]  We must wake up and say no now, or it's over.
[02:19:56.803 --> 02:19:57.544]  Nazi Germany.
[02:19:57.804 --> 02:19:58.084]  Okay?
[02:19:58.284 --> 02:19:59.424]  You better wake up now, folks.
[02:20:00.765 --> 02:20:04.050]  Jim Newcomer with Midas Resources, talking today about change.
[02:20:04.290 --> 02:20:09.478]  Not the change we were promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in these changing economic times.
[02:20:09.698 --> 02:20:15.066]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion, and our unfunded liabilities totaling over $107 trillion,
[02:20:16.448 --> 02:20:17.269]  The value of the U.S.
[02:20:17.309 --> 02:20:19.231]  dollar continues its slide into oblivion.
[02:20:19.391 --> 02:20:23.855]  There's still time to ensure your financial security with precious metals, but you need to act today.

[02:20:33.243 --> 02:20:41.508]  With our government continuing to find new ways to spend our money at the expense of our children and grandchildren, there's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation with Precious Metals.
[02:20:41.728 --> 02:20:52.515]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we'll discuss how you can take physical possession or convert your IRA into Precious Metals before it's too late.

[02:22:10.142 --> 02:22:12.344]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:22:12.364 --> 02:22:17.808]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:22:18.248 --> 02:22:24.473]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:22:24.893 --> 02:22:30.457]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:22:30.877 --> 02:22:34.579]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.

[02:22:39.342 --> 02:22:44.866]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:22:45.306 --> 02:22:48.428]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:22:48.848 --> 02:22:50.269]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:22:50.829 --> 02:22:51.270]  It's here.

[02:23:00.100 --> 02:23:07.084]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[02:23:07.305 --> 02:23:10.967]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[02:23:11.267 --> 02:23:19.352]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[02:23:19.592 --> 02:23:22.294]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[02:23:22.494 --> 02:23:24.976]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[02:23:25.256 --> 02:23:29.479]  Thieves get near you, push a button, and these tiny radios give out personal information.
[02:23:29.699 --> 02:23:31.120]  Put a stop to identity theft.
[02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:33.222]  Visit IDStronghold.com.
[02:23:33.442 --> 02:23:35.763]  Here you will find radio-blocking secure sleeves.
[02:23:36.184 --> 02:23:43.489]  Simply place your credit cards and passports into these slim, lightweight sleeves, and you will put a stop to anyone trying to collect your private information.
[02:23:43.769 --> 02:23:47.471]  For around $5 you will be protected against RFID theft.
[02:23:47.691 --> 02:23:49.992]  Visit IDStronghold.com.
[02:23:50.152 --> 02:23:52.393]  That's IDStronghold.com.
[02:23:52.634 --> 02:23:53.074]  Or call 1-800-610-2770.
[02:23:53.094 --> 02:23:53.334]  1-800-610-2770 today.
[02:23:53.354 --> 02:23:55.355]  Alright, more of your calls coming up towards the end of this hour.
[02:24:08.083 --> 02:24:20.798]  We're also going to play that video clip of Call of Duty integrated in with real battlefield footage to show how it's desensitizing and conditioning people and changing military culture, dehumanizing the troops, not just those they're killing and maiming.
[02:24:21.639 --> 02:24:28.127]  But I don't want to recap all of this, but for those that just joined us,
[02:24:29.958 --> 02:24:41.001]  Over a year ago, Richard Plosky, a white supremacist who all over the web hated me and had all these blogs about how bad I was because I'm not anti-semitic and don't call for violence, shot three cops and killed them.
[02:24:41.882 --> 02:24:46.123]  The Southern Poverty Law Center with their reporter within two hours said that it was basically my fault.
[02:24:46.403 --> 02:24:51.645]  We forced retractions in five newspapers because we went and found that he was attacking me everywhere and was not supporting me.
[02:24:52.385 --> 02:24:59.647]  We've had to go to registration on the comments at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and it has upped the quality of some of the comments.
[02:25:01.840 --> 02:25:08.724]  Because people were going in there calling for violence, and I have three moderators, we didn't censor anybody unless they called for violence.
[02:25:11.226 --> 02:25:12.686]  And, or spammed.
[02:25:14.407 --> 02:25:27.015]  And we've seen the London Guardian, the New York Times, Time Magazine, literally hundreds of publications, Media Matters, it's gotta be more than 50 times, I haven't counted it up, run by George Soros, the banker wanting to loot America, running Obama,
[02:25:28.374 --> 02:25:33.258]  Saying that I'm calling for violence and it's not true and everyone knows that.
[02:25:34.378 --> 02:25:37.961]  So they're clearly trying to set me up with the police and the IRS.
[02:25:39.782 --> 02:25:42.905]  But it says Alex Jones pits Fox News versus Fox News.
[02:25:42.965 --> 02:25:47.888]  Last week Fox News wrote two articles off comments on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:25:47.908 --> 02:25:48.649]  That was the last straw.
[02:25:48.669 --> 02:25:51.771]  We went to registration and
[02:25:54.605 --> 02:26:02.850]  They spin this even more than Fox News and say that it's my fault and that, oh look, Fox News is in trouble, they've got involved with me.
[02:26:03.411 --> 02:26:11.816]  We wrote an article showing Fox Nation with people calling for things way more violent in actual articles that they wrote and on Fox News with the videos.
[02:26:14.465 --> 02:26:17.046]  Fox News is pushing for the value-added tax that Obama wants.
[02:26:17.066 --> 02:26:17.946]  They all work together.
[02:26:17.966 --> 02:26:18.707]  It makes me sick.
[02:26:19.087 --> 02:26:20.007]  But look at this article.
[02:26:20.027 --> 02:26:21.388]  This is just today's latest.
[02:26:21.408 --> 02:26:22.348]  It's every day.
[02:26:23.088 --> 02:26:25.129]  Alex Jones pits Fox News versus Fox News.
[02:26:25.469 --> 02:26:30.971]  Are some at Fox News having second thoughts about embracing and helping the mainstream fringe anti-government conspiracy nut Alex Jones?
[02:26:32.272 --> 02:26:33.132]  No one's done that.
[02:26:33.152 --> 02:26:40.615]  I mean, they had me on about 9-11 to try to blame the shooting on me at the Pentagon.
[02:26:41.735 --> 02:26:43.016]  That wasn't them being friendly to me.
[02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:49.212]  Especially now that Jones' website seems to be stoking calls for violence against federal employees.
[02:26:49.672 --> 02:26:50.792]  I'm stoking calls!
[02:26:52.553 --> 02:26:59.337]  When you can go to any big website and read violent comments, that doesn't mean MSNBC or CNN or any other outfit's guilty of it.
[02:27:00.417 --> 02:27:07.181]  Here's a recent FoxNews.com report on the rash of anti-government threats being made on IRS workers in the wake of health care reform being passed.
[02:27:08.421 --> 02:27:09.242]  And then it goes through it.
[02:27:10.478 --> 02:27:15.520]  So it appears that Jones is at the center of the radical anti-government movement and owns a radical right-wing website.
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:17.480]  We're constitutional, it's not right-wing.
[02:27:17.881 --> 02:27:21.362]  Which seems to be housing lots of potentially murderous rhetoric about the IRS.
[02:27:22.102 --> 02:27:22.822]  We're housing it.
[02:27:23.863 --> 02:27:25.723]  So we need to be restricted, like Ed Schultz says.
[02:27:26.203 --> 02:27:29.164]  Message from foxnews.com article, Alex Jones is a bad guy.
[02:27:29.644 --> 02:27:35.266]  That's odd because last year Fox News presented the same government-hating Jones as something of a folk hero.
[02:27:35.466 --> 02:27:35.606]  What?
[02:27:38.700 --> 02:27:43.743]  This is what they're doing, and they're calling for censorship of everybody, but they're singling me out.
[02:27:43.863 --> 02:27:45.344]  Why is George Soros doing that?
[02:27:45.584 --> 02:27:47.325]  Because I'm against further banker bailouts.
[02:27:47.385 --> 02:27:51.128]  I'm against the insurance takeover that's a new tax written up by the insurance companies.
[02:27:51.148 --> 02:27:52.869]  94% of their lobbying went for it.
[02:27:53.369 --> 02:27:54.249]  That's Wall Street Journal.
[02:27:55.890 --> 02:27:56.771]  I'm here telling the truth.
[02:27:56.851 --> 02:27:58.312]  I'm here shattering the left-right paradigm.
[02:27:58.572 --> 02:28:04.916]  I'm here explaining that Republican leaders and their pundits are pushing for the value-added tax to be paid to the bankers when we don't owe this money.
[02:28:06.394 --> 02:28:11.484]  We're real, ladies and gentlemen, and it is spooky, it is creepy that this is going on.
[02:28:11.925 --> 02:28:18.017]  Now, before I get into all the value-added taxes and the rest of it that are now coming,
[02:28:19.431 --> 02:28:20.191]  I want to get into this.
[02:28:20.391 --> 02:28:22.352]  Rat on your boss, get paid by the IRS.
[02:28:22.372 --> 02:28:29.254]  This has been going on for years, but this says you can get 15 to 30 percent of anything you rat on your boss about.
[02:28:29.734 --> 02:28:34.235]  And with basically informants, the government just has people lie about you to get the money.
[02:28:35.015 --> 02:28:36.596]  So this is the total snitch culture.
[02:28:36.996 --> 02:28:37.756]  Now here's another one.
[02:28:38.696 --> 02:28:48.599]  Remember USA Today a few years ago about how when you call to get a pizza, they run your name to the database to see if there's any warrants and they also sell the data to bill collectors?
[02:28:50.512 --> 02:28:51.573]  of where you really live.
[02:28:52.073 --> 02:28:54.315]  So it's just every major corporation is doing this.
[02:28:55.055 --> 02:28:59.478]  Dallas, this is out of MSNBC, Dallas-based NARC Technologies Inc.
[02:28:59.818 --> 02:29:01.379]  pays people to rat on their neighbors.
[02:29:01.479 --> 02:29:02.140]  And what for?
[02:29:02.980 --> 02:29:06.303]  Just to know where all their neighbors are in case there's bill collectors.
[02:29:06.923 --> 02:29:10.525]  So your neighbors, this is the new economy, there's only jobs in government and NARCing.
[02:29:10.926 --> 02:29:12.567]  They're converting the whole economy over to this.
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:16.702]  Can you make money just by writing down the license plate numbers of cars in your neighborhood?
[02:29:17.022 --> 02:29:19.944]  It might sound like a game your older brother made up to keep you busy.
[02:29:20.204 --> 02:29:23.827]  But two aggressive startup firms are telling customers to do just that.
[02:29:24.147 --> 02:29:26.569]  And both are spreading the word quickly online.
[02:29:28.373 --> 02:29:29.173]  But how does it work?
[02:29:29.634 --> 02:29:34.517]  One of the two Dallas-based companies, NARC Technologies, Inc., offers a simple explanation.
[02:29:34.857 --> 02:29:44.923]  They want you to write on your neighbor's, the firm's website, narcthatcar.com, is designed to collect license plate numbers and locations so lenders can more easily repossess cars when owners default.
[02:29:44.963 --> 02:29:46.343]  See, everyone's guilty.
[02:29:46.543 --> 02:29:48.284]  And now they have the license plate reading software.
[02:29:48.304 --> 02:29:49.045]  That's already being done.
[02:29:50.946 --> 02:29:51.887]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.347 --> 02:29:53.948]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.868 --> 02:29:57.550]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.615 --> 02:30:01.596]  What's your home worth?
[02:30:01.777 --> 02:30:03.719]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:30:03.899 --> 02:30:06.643]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[02:30:06.943 --> 02:30:14.472]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[02:30:14.653 --> 02:30:18.097]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.
[02:30:18.297 --> 02:30:20.419]  It's so easy, and best of all, it's free!

[02:30:34.892 --> 02:30:44.541]  HomeGain.com has an A-plus rating with the Better Business Bureau, and contains a wealth of information, like their home improvement tool that helps you determine which home improvements to make to increase your home's value.
[02:30:44.781 --> 02:30:47.842]  See the top 12 home improvements right now at HomeGain.com.
[02:30:47.943 --> 02:30:50.764]  That's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[02:30:50.924 --> 02:30:58.988]  Look for Max, the Orange Home Gain Gorilla, to help you find a realtor or with any other real estate needs you might have at HomeGain.com, your real estate connection.
[02:31:00.714 --> 02:31:03.035]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:31:03.095 --> 02:31:05.276]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:31:05.296 --> 02:31:08.197]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:31:08.617 --> 02:31:13.358]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:31:13.739 --> 02:31:17.920]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:31:18.240 --> 02:31:20.582]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:31:20.702 --> 02:31:23.104]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:31:23.124 --> 02:31:26.046]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:31:26.387 --> 02:31:33.993]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:31:34.313 --> 02:31:39.577]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:31:39.697 --> 02:31:41.979]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:31:42.019 --> 02:31:46.002]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:31:46.262 --> 02:31:47.163]  And I got news for you.
[02:31:47.323 --> 02:31:48.544]  You're everyone else.
[02:31:48.664 --> 02:31:49.684]  Invisible Empire.

[02:31:59.935 --> 02:32:00.575]  Hi, everyone.
[02:32:00.735 --> 02:32:01.596]  Andy Anderson here.
[02:32:01.796 --> 02:32:06.058]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[02:32:06.198 --> 02:32:11.861]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[02:32:12.001 --> 02:32:16.243]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness.
[02:32:16.343 --> 02:32:18.084]  No more protection till you use it again.
[02:32:18.204 --> 02:32:19.285]  Pure Works to the rescue!
[02:32:19.525 --> 02:32:23.889]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[02:32:23.929 --> 02:32:25.990]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[02:32:26.130 --> 02:32:39.161]  PureWorks Disinfecting Spray is EPA-certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria, moles, and fungus, too.
[02:32:39.201 --> 02:32:40.742]  It's even safe around pets and children.
[02:32:40.842 --> 02:32:43.924]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[02:32:44.004 --> 02:32:45.025]  No more dry skin.
[02:32:45.185 --> 02:32:49.649]  Here's to a little peace of mind knowing that your hands are still germ-free hours later.
[02:32:49.789 --> 02:32:56.834]  Call now toll-free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on PureWorks and get PureWorks on your hands.
[02:32:56.954 --> 02:32:57.234]  That's 888-245-0300.
[02:33:10.740 --> 02:33:16.665]  So in other words, the firm wants consumers to become the repo man's informant, reading from MSNBC.
[02:33:17.305 --> 02:33:20.247]  It's all part of training everyone to spy on the population.
[02:33:20.287 --> 02:33:24.691]  The squad cars are getting license plate readers that can read hundreds of cars' license plates a second.
[02:33:25.111 --> 02:33:29.234]  The public in England and in cities like New York are being paid.
[02:33:30.715 --> 02:33:33.357]  If you're on welfare, you have to have a job, which is
[02:33:34.398 --> 02:33:38.199]  Watching computer screens, tattling on people, surveillance cameras.
[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:43.661]  Its chief competitor, Data Network Affiliate, says it has no intention of getting into the business of repossession.
[02:33:44.221 --> 02:33:49.383]  It says its plans to use a database of license plate numbers to help find missing children through Amber Alerts.
[02:33:49.923 --> 02:33:50.063]  Oh!
[02:33:50.363 --> 02:33:52.484]  See, everyone's going to be watched pre-crime.
[02:33:53.084 --> 02:33:54.505]  And they're getting the citizens involved.
[02:33:54.625 --> 02:33:56.045]  Everyone's going to be put in the database.
[02:33:56.526 --> 02:34:03.608]  It also hopes to sell the data to other information-hungry marketing firms and to turn its user base into a kind of buyer's club.
[02:34:04.923 --> 02:34:08.606]  And they're giving citizens radar guns and teaching kids how to spy.
[02:34:08.626 --> 02:34:11.549]  All the popular kid toys are about spying on your parents.
[02:34:13.190 --> 02:34:13.951]  Here's another headline.
[02:34:13.971 --> 02:34:16.713]  Will jotting down license plates pay the rent?
[02:34:17.995 --> 02:34:18.915]  That's another article.
[02:34:22.819 --> 02:34:25.201]  See, we are being baptized in evil.
[02:34:25.221 --> 02:34:28.384]  We're being trained to do everything that brings you tyranny.
[02:34:31.855 --> 02:34:36.078]  Separately, I want to get into the economy now before we play this video clip and take some more calls.
[02:34:38.539 --> 02:34:46.745]  Here's the message you're not going to get from the Wall Street Journal that is reporting Volcker carbon tax VAT value added should be on the table.
[02:34:49.147 --> 02:34:56.994]  The Republican pundits, for more than a decade, have been telling you they're going to replace the income tax with a VAT and sales tax.
[02:34:57.314 --> 02:35:02.358]  No, I've been telling you, because we have the documents from the PR firms, that they're going to keep all of them.
[02:35:02.438 --> 02:35:03.419]  Now they admit that!
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:05.821]  This is the way to pay off the deficit.
[02:35:05.841 --> 02:35:06.862]  How about we cut the government?
[02:35:06.882 --> 02:35:10.385]  How about we don't owe this money, like Iceland and Greece are saying no to paying?
[02:35:11.426 --> 02:35:13.307]  How about we cut all of these programs?
[02:35:13.387 --> 02:35:17.030]  No, the government's growing and hiring more and more people.
[02:35:17.924 --> 02:35:18.745]  Every millisecond.
[02:35:19.365 --> 02:35:21.647]  And hiring snitches and spies and tattletales.
[02:35:22.247 --> 02:35:24.909]  And squeezing and writing more tickets and grabbing more children.
[02:35:26.030 --> 02:35:31.934]  It is a criminal enterprise that has taken over the nation.
[02:35:31.954 --> 02:35:34.476]  And we have an article here by Kurt Nemo that breaks it all down.
[02:35:35.317 --> 02:35:38.820]  Former Fed mob boss calls VAT and carbon taxes.
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:41.081]  Calls for VAT and carbon taxes.
[02:35:43.503 --> 02:35:45.725]  And the big problem here is, well, cue it up.
[02:35:45.805 --> 02:35:47.106]  Cue up Glenn Beck on
[02:35:48.462 --> 02:36:01.930]  Bill O'Reilly, and this is almost every day on his radio or TV show, both of them, calling for this, calling for this, and saying, don't worry, we're going to have a constitutional amendment where 100% of the money goes to pay the banks.
[02:36:02.691 --> 02:36:03.111]  Play the clip.
[02:36:04.333 --> 02:36:07.316]  Last night, I know you watch the Factor every night, so you can steal material.
[02:36:08.637 --> 02:36:14.483]  And I said that, economically, we can bring the country back, but you have to do some discipline.
[02:36:14.503 --> 02:36:15.384]  You have to free spending.
[02:36:15.944 --> 02:36:19.027]  You have to have a national sales tax, 10%.
[02:36:19.688 --> 02:36:20.468]  What did you think about that?
[02:36:22.970 --> 02:36:23.570]  I made some notes.
[02:36:23.870 --> 02:36:24.210]  Excellent.
[02:36:24.290 --> 02:36:25.091]  I actually agree with you.
[02:36:25.251 --> 02:36:27.491]  Except, I believe it should be a VAT tax.
[02:36:27.832 --> 02:36:28.192]  2% VAT.
[02:36:28.232 --> 02:36:29.892]  Value-added tax.
[02:36:29.972 --> 02:36:30.392]  No more than 2%.
[02:36:30.492 --> 02:36:34.714]  What's the difference between a sales tax and a value-added tax?
[02:36:34.774 --> 02:36:36.334]  It always starts with 2%.
[02:36:36.394 --> 02:36:37.255]  That's enough.
[02:36:37.735 --> 02:36:40.856]  Now with conservatives like these, who needs Mao Zedong?
[02:36:41.516 --> 02:36:42.596]  Who needs Joe Stalin?
[02:36:44.277 --> 02:36:47.138]  Obama spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[02:36:47.158 --> 02:36:47.998]  We thought Bush was bad.
[02:36:48.038 --> 02:36:49.299]  Tripling the size of the government.
[02:36:49.359 --> 02:36:50.519]  Tripling the budget.
[02:36:53.752 --> 02:36:56.974]  And they've got all these conservatives running around talking about fair taxes all day.
[02:36:57.574 --> 02:36:57.815]  Look.
[02:36:59.075 --> 02:36:59.516]  Get ready.
[02:36:59.656 --> 02:37:03.038]  The bankers now have dominated and overthrown this country economically.
[02:37:03.098 --> 02:37:04.159]  It's all done through fraud.
[02:37:05.134 --> 02:37:21.331]  And the health care bill's a bunch of taxes, all these other income taxes, all these state income taxes, all these unfunded mandates to the states, the carbon taxes that Obama's trying to ram through the Senate again, and they're announcing next week they're going to go ahead and implement it through the EPA regardless.
[02:37:21.632 --> 02:37:24.114]  This is all illegal and lawless.
[02:37:24.875 --> 02:37:37.166]  And people need to get angry and realize that the Republican Party was in power of both the House, the Senate, and the executives for six years of Bush's eight years and the government tripled.
[02:37:38.168 --> 02:37:44.253]  And that's why people are voting for Rand Paul in Kentucky and why the Republican Party's coming in trying to stop him because he's 10 points ahead.
[02:37:44.694 --> 02:37:50.679]  Because this is an anti-incumbency against Republicans and Democrats who are globalists, who are incumbents.
[02:37:51.360 --> 02:38:01.869]  That's why for the first time in history, in the U.S., the head election official who's running against Rand Paul is allowed to run his own campaign against Rand Paul and run the election.
[02:38:02.450 --> 02:38:03.571]  I mean, you talk about mafia.
[02:38:04.605 --> 02:38:10.489]  Because if they let anybody like a Debra Medina or a Rand Paul get in, that sends shockwaves through the country.
[02:38:10.769 --> 02:38:16.253]  We've got to take the states back, take the federal government back from the UN and the offshore banks that have bought it off.
[02:38:16.613 --> 02:38:17.654]  It's very elementary.
[02:38:17.894 --> 02:38:20.215]  These banks have taken over hundreds of third world nations.
[02:38:20.235 --> 02:38:21.516]  They do the same thing every time.
[02:38:21.776 --> 02:38:30.042]  They get you in debt, then they jack up the taxes, cut all the so-called entitlements and freebies.
[02:38:32.657 --> 02:38:41.279]  Okay, I've got some other news I want to hit on, but I briefly, because I've got to get to this video here in a moment, I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up of Midas Resources because gold for the last week has been shooting straight up.
[02:38:41.779 --> 02:38:48.701]  It's come out in lawsuits that the IMF, World Bank, and Federal Reserve have been suppressing gold and silver prices with inflation.
[02:38:49.041 --> 02:38:50.302]  Gold should be $2,500.
[02:38:50.642 --> 02:38:51.422]  Silver should be above $30.
[02:38:51.502 --> 02:38:53.363]  That's conservative right now.
[02:38:54.003 --> 02:38:58.184]  Regardless, Ted Anderson's got gold and silver, the owner of this radio network.
[02:38:59.346 --> 02:39:00.047]  That's how I met him.
[02:39:00.067 --> 02:39:03.730]  He was a sponsor of my show 13 years ago before he started this network.
[02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:06.232]  He already produces his own radio shows, his own news shows.
[02:39:07.093 --> 02:39:10.396]  And I found nowhere to buy gold at a better price or silver at a better price.
[02:39:11.057 --> 02:39:13.779]  He's been in business 30 years, had Midas for what, 13 years?
[02:39:15.180 --> 02:39:17.761]  And he's got a AAA rating with the Better Business Bureau.
[02:39:17.821 --> 02:39:18.801]  Most of these places don't.
[02:39:19.361 --> 02:39:20.562]  Most of them have horrible ratings.
[02:39:20.782 --> 02:39:22.462]  You need to buy gold and silver from Ted.
[02:39:22.482 --> 02:39:25.603]  You need to protect yourself with physical holdings.
[02:39:26.183 --> 02:39:30.625]  And I get it as an insurance policy against inflation and depression and crises.
[02:39:31.025 --> 02:39:33.906]  I don't buy gold and silver as an investment but as an emergency backup.
[02:39:34.246 --> 02:39:40.428]  But it is an investment that's almost 400% in the last decade versus the stock market that's basically flat with inflation.
[02:39:40.928 --> 02:39:42.893]  Ted Anderson, good to have you here with us.
[02:39:42.913 --> 02:39:44.817]  Tell folks about today's incredible offer.
[02:39:44.837 --> 02:39:46.861]  When I say incredible, folks, Ted, explain.
[02:39:47.421 --> 02:39:50.703]  Yeah, sure, I'll tell you right now, gold's up another $20 today.
[02:39:51.243 --> 02:39:57.066]  Actually, that's where its market peak was currently right now, up $16 in the $1,150 range.
[02:39:57.466 --> 02:40:03.129]  I still have those francs at $249.68, and yes, you still get the International Forecaster.
[02:40:03.649 --> 02:40:08.811]  Calculate it out, it's less than $500 an ounce for that piece of gold.
[02:40:08.871 --> 02:40:09.992]  I mean, it's really low.
[02:40:10.772 --> 02:40:12.953]  The whole market, I mean, the British Sovereign's $312.42.
[02:40:14.814 --> 02:40:15.915]  Look at the internet prices.
[02:40:15.955 --> 02:40:19.357]  They've gone up now.
[02:40:19.437 --> 02:40:25.520]  I'm still holding the same on the sovereign coins from the Montana... Yeah, let's explain to people, okay?
[02:40:25.961 --> 02:40:30.543]  You bought when gold went down, but you didn't make your prices go up when it went up.
[02:40:30.903 --> 02:40:34.686]  You still have gold and silver that you're selling when the market was...
[02:40:36.087 --> 02:40:37.888]  $100 plus lower.
[02:40:38.489 --> 02:40:39.390]  That was $1,050.
[02:40:39.570 --> 02:40:40.611]  It's $1,150.
[02:40:41.011 --> 02:40:43.934]  So right at $100 right now.
[02:40:44.394 --> 02:40:52.221]  And so any tiny markup you had on that lower price isn't even there anymore because we're in a market that's $100 up.
[02:40:52.622 --> 02:41:01.510]  And on the fifth of an ounce European gold franc coin, you're giving them $159 value, your subscription to the International Forecaster on top of it.
[02:41:01.852 --> 02:41:02.514]  I am, yeah.
[02:41:02.594 --> 02:41:04.377]  Bob Chapman's newsletter is great.
[02:41:04.438 --> 02:41:10.911]  I mean, great detail on what's going on in the marketplace, and you're going to get more than what you see out on Wall Street, that's for sure.
[02:41:11.332 --> 02:41:13.216]  And I gotta tell you, Alex, right now the
[02:41:14.537 --> 02:41:23.200]  Well, where we're at economically, the United States has drilled itself into a debt that I don't think we can ever repay without turning on the printing press.
[02:41:23.220 --> 02:41:28.681]  Well, Dr. Roberts, the father of Reaganomics, said basically it's the New World Order and it's all by design today.
[02:41:28.701 --> 02:41:30.162]  It is by design.
[02:41:30.202 --> 02:41:38.744]  They want this thing to fail so we can be pushed into this international currency thing, and obviously that's not good for our sovereignty here in the United States at all.
[02:41:39.304 --> 02:41:40.946]  Folks, protect yourself today.
[02:41:41.006 --> 02:41:41.867]  Ted, we're out of time.
[02:41:42.107 --> 02:41:44.370]  Throw out some of the best coin offers you've got for people.
[02:41:44.630 --> 02:41:45.791]  It's the Alex Jones Special.
[02:41:45.811 --> 02:41:51.558]  You'll pay more, which is still a great deal, but you'll pay more if you don't tell them Alex Jones sent you, and Ted is running out of these prices.
[02:41:51.598 --> 02:41:54.081]  How long can you hold these prices, and what is the offer?
[02:41:54.301 --> 02:41:59.667]  Well, right now the offer is Franks at $249.68, British Sovereigns at $312.42.
[02:41:59.967 --> 02:42:05.332]  I have the Walking Liberty half right now for less than $10 if you call and say you heard it on Alex's show.
[02:42:05.633 --> 02:42:08.015]  They're at $9.75.
[02:42:08.616 --> 02:42:11.359]  There's a variety of different things, but you'll have to call.
[02:42:11.719 --> 02:42:13.981]  The market's moving up, and the way to get ahold of us is 1-800-686-2237.
[02:42:18.980 --> 02:42:19.320]  800-686-2237.
[02:42:19.340 --> 02:42:19.380]  800-686-2237.
[02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:26.442]  So again, can you hold this till tomorrow?
[02:42:26.482 --> 02:42:27.022]  Till Friday?
[02:42:27.062 --> 02:42:27.483]  How long?
[02:42:27.843 --> 02:42:32.764]  Well, Alex, it depends upon what happens in the marketplace, actually, and what my supply does.
[02:42:32.824 --> 02:42:36.565]  If I get a lot of people calling me up, I'm going to have to shut it off at midnight tonight.
[02:42:36.585 --> 02:42:37.005]  800-686-2237.
[02:42:37.085 --> 02:42:37.585]  Thank you, Ted.
[02:42:37.605 --> 02:42:38.706]  Yep, thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:42:38.726 --> 02:42:39.086]  800-686-2237.
[02:42:39.166 --> 02:42:39.306]  Okay.
[02:42:48.086 --> 02:42:50.649]  We've seen the video of troops killing dogs.
[02:42:50.689 --> 02:42:54.333]  We've seen the video of them beating unarmed children and laughing and celebrating.
[02:42:54.813 --> 02:43:00.720]  We've seen the video of troops and contractors sitting off the road of a busy highway, randomly shooting up cars full of people laughing.
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:02.982]  The government and the media defend this.
[02:43:03.703 --> 02:43:06.145]  You destroy and disgrace our military when you do that.
[02:43:06.165 --> 02:43:12.630]  If you care about the military and our history, which has been a great history, you don't allow the nazification of our military.
[02:43:12.670 --> 02:43:13.731]  You decry what's happening.
[02:43:13.771 --> 02:43:24.619]  But scientifically, using government-developed video games in the last 35 years, that's on record, they have conditioned people to have instinctive killing and to enjoy it and to see it as a game.
[02:43:24.939 --> 02:43:26.981]  This is turning our people into psychopaths.
[02:43:27.001 --> 02:43:28.202]  Psychopaths enjoy killing.
[02:43:28.702 --> 02:43:30.564]  If you gotta go to war and gotta kill, that's one thing.
[02:43:30.824 --> 02:43:31.605]  You don't enjoy it.
[02:43:32.372 --> 02:43:33.514]  Now, the bully's beating you up.
[02:43:33.554 --> 02:43:34.355]  You get the better of them.
[02:43:34.375 --> 02:43:36.237]  Yeah, you're going to enjoy them when you knock them on their butt.
[02:43:36.557 --> 02:43:44.067]  But I'm talking about killing kids, blowing up vehicles, shooting up people, helping wounded reporters, and laughing about it.
[02:43:44.327 --> 02:43:47.532]  And we're going to show this next to Call of Duty clips.
[02:43:48.746 --> 02:43:54.989]  My office put this together, they did a great job, showing the conditioning in this video game that made $600 million in the last few months.
[02:43:55.489 --> 02:44:05.794]  This is what people are playing and now the Pentagon admits, a couple months ago I saw in MSNBC, that they're using PlayStation controllers to fly Predator drones and they're taking young
[02:44:06.434 --> 02:44:09.636]  College students that have high scores, and now they're piloting drones.
[02:44:10.036 --> 02:44:11.017]  And it's all a big joke.
[02:44:11.357 --> 02:44:15.220]  They've been conditioned on video games, and this is all part of us losing our soul.
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:17.702]  And now killing innocent civilians.
[02:44:17.722 --> 02:44:23.045]  And now they're deploying drones against the American people, and crowd-controlled drones in the U.S.
[02:44:23.065 --> 02:44:24.246]  I'm sure you've seen that on the news.
[02:44:24.566 --> 02:44:32.912]  So let's start playing the audio and video of Call of Duty, interspersed with real audio and video from the troops engaging in war crimes.
[02:44:33.212 --> 02:44:36.314]  Here it is, as their souls are being conditioned into evil.
[02:44:37.154 --> 02:44:42.336]  One of the soldiers, the 8th Cavs doctor, has shot a dog he said was about to attack him.
[02:44:42.516 --> 02:44:44.997]  Get away from it!
[02:44:45.037 --> 02:44:46.938]  You're carrying the meat, sir!
[02:44:46.998 --> 02:44:47.858]  I know.
[02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:15.490]  Here's torture.
[02:45:18.351 --> 02:45:18.752]  Yes.
[02:45:19.132 --> 02:45:20.392]  Naughty little boys.
[02:45:20.772 --> 02:45:21.653]  Then real torture.
[02:45:22.353 --> 02:45:22.753]  Children.
[02:45:22.773 --> 02:45:28.095]  These men are trying to surrender!
[02:45:28.556 --> 02:45:29.976]  Look around you, Chernoff.
[02:45:30.997 --> 02:45:33.618]  Do you think these men will be denied their revenge?
[02:45:34.878 --> 02:45:35.438]  Yes.
[02:45:36.139 --> 02:45:36.859]  Yes.
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:40.600]  Features him to have revenge.
[02:45:40.620 --> 02:45:43.241]  Meet and Royce and check out the favela for any signs of arrest.
[02:45:43.342 --> 02:45:44.422]  That's where this guy was headed.
[02:45:48.230 --> 02:45:50.532]  Oh please, don't hurt me!
[02:45:50.552 --> 02:45:51.492]  Come on, fire!
[02:46:15.382 --> 02:46:16.943]  Here's the conditioning.
[02:46:16.983 --> 02:46:19.025]  Pavlovian conditioning like we're animals.
[02:46:19.885 --> 02:46:21.166]  Building the army of Satan.
[02:46:22.127 --> 02:46:24.929]  Killing innocent reporters.
[02:46:24.949 --> 02:46:26.330]  Killing unarmed reporters as they crawl away.
[02:46:46.019 --> 02:46:47.700]  Then it cuts to video games.
[02:47:13.420 --> 02:47:14.901]  With the exact same nomenclature.
[02:47:15.241 --> 02:47:16.342]  Good kill, good kill.
[02:47:17.703 --> 02:47:17.943]  Nice.
[02:47:19.584 --> 02:47:20.085]  That's you.
[02:47:20.485 --> 02:47:21.226]  Thank you.
[02:47:21.466 --> 02:47:24.028]  There's one guy moving down there, but he's the one.
[02:47:24.108 --> 02:47:27.430]  Alright, we'll let him down so they can hurry him.
[02:47:27.530 --> 02:47:32.694]  You know what I mean?
[02:47:32.734 --> 02:47:37.057]  We also have one individual, appears to be wounded, trying to crawl away.
[02:47:37.077 --> 02:47:38.478]  We got a runner here.
[02:47:50.282 --> 02:47:52.523]  Now an ambulance pulls up with children to get him.
[02:47:53.263 --> 02:47:54.444]  If he has a weapon on his hands?
[02:47:54.844 --> 02:47:56.104]  No, I haven't seen one yet.
[02:47:56.425 --> 02:47:58.705]  You guys got that guy crawling right now on the curb?
[02:47:58.826 --> 02:47:59.786]  Yeah, I got him.
[02:47:59.966 --> 02:48:06.108]  I put two rounds in here and you guys are shooting over there too.
[02:48:06.209 --> 02:48:07.889]  So, we'll see.
[02:48:07.909 --> 02:48:14.152]  They pull up to help the reporter and they open fire on the van.
[02:48:14.352 --> 02:48:15.452]  With little kids inside.
[02:48:15.873 --> 02:48:19.014]  Roger, I'm just trying to make sure that you guys have my curb over.
[02:48:22.987 --> 02:48:26.389]  Here's a false flag terror attack.
[02:48:26.409 --> 02:48:30.031]  Where a government kills a bunch of innocent people in an airport.
[02:48:50.578 --> 02:48:53.260]  And then blames it on a group they want to attack.
[02:48:56.503 --> 02:48:57.283]  It's all training.
[02:48:58.084 --> 02:48:58.704]  Bloodlust.
[02:49:01.086 --> 02:49:02.467]  Then the Russians kill a U.S.
[02:49:02.507 --> 02:49:04.649]  soldier who's with them to set up the U.S.
[02:49:04.669 --> 02:49:05.290]  for the attack.
[02:49:05.690 --> 02:49:07.091]  False flag terror being taught.
[02:49:07.571 --> 02:49:08.132]  It's in U.S.
[02:49:08.192 --> 02:49:08.912]  Army manuals.
[02:49:09.213 --> 02:49:11.274]  Captain and above and black ops out of stage terror.
[02:49:19.636 --> 02:49:20.836]  There's the van full of kids.
[02:49:23.117 --> 02:49:23.957]  Innocent reporters.
[02:49:35.021 --> 02:49:35.961]  Nice job.
[02:49:36.781 --> 02:49:38.282]  They're all coming back here to be cops.
[02:49:40.142 --> 02:49:41.843]  All your kids having their minds warped.
[02:49:41.863 --> 02:49:45.064]  In a giant re-education camp being turned into psychopaths.
[02:49:46.937 --> 02:49:49.319]  And how it's so glorious, so wonderful.
[02:49:49.619 --> 02:49:52.261]  Meanwhile, the banks are waging economic warfare upon us.
[02:49:52.761 --> 02:49:54.523]  Openly preparing to take your pension funds.
[02:49:55.604 --> 02:49:57.285]  Teaching you that Washington's gonna be nuked.
[02:50:13.697 --> 02:50:14.558]  And then the real death.
[02:50:16.727 --> 02:50:17.928]  Yeah, I just drove over a body.
[02:50:17.968 --> 02:50:18.188]  Yeah.
[02:50:18.228 --> 02:50:20.170]  Yeah, I just drove over a body.
[02:50:20.210 --> 02:50:20.410]  Yeah.
[02:50:20.430 --> 02:50:20.750]  Roger.
[02:50:20.790 --> 02:50:20.910]  Brake.
[02:50:20.951 --> 02:50:21.551]  Crazy Horse 1-8.
[02:50:21.591 --> 02:50:24.413]  Request permission to engage.
[02:50:48.208 --> 02:50:49.269]  There's the children.
[02:50:51.631 --> 02:50:57.896]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[02:50:57.956 --> 02:50:58.916]  The final segment.
[02:50:59.237 --> 02:50:59.957]  Stay with us.
[02:51:04.400 --> 02:51:10.105]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[02:51:10.705 --> 02:51:12.567]  The world is changing fast.
[02:51:12.927 --> 02:51:14.368]  Are you fully prepared?
[02:51:15.151 --> 02:51:17.812]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[02:51:18.352 --> 02:51:28.637]  At PatriotFood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned meat for half price.
[02:51:29.057 --> 02:51:38.641]  And at SurvivalistSeeds.com, we now offer 50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over 10,000 heirloom seeds.
[02:51:40.402 --> 02:51:44.669]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[02:51:45.270 --> 02:51:49.596]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[02:51:49.877 --> 02:51:52.241]  Food insurance, just in case.
[02:51:52.841 --> 02:51:54.925]  Owned by me, Big John Lipscomb.
[02:52:00.728 --> 02:52:04.431]  You may be arrested and you're subject to other police action.
[02:52:04.531 --> 02:52:05.471]  Tyranny is here.
[02:52:05.791 --> 02:52:09.514]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:09.734 --> 02:52:11.936]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:11.956 --> 02:52:17.399]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:52:17.820 --> 02:52:24.064]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:24.484 --> 02:52:30.027]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:52:30.427 --> 02:52:34.169]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:52:34.649 --> 02:52:38.651]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:52:38.931 --> 02:52:44.454]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:52:44.874 --> 02:52:48.015]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:48.436 --> 02:52:49.836]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:50.397 --> 02:52:50.837]  It's here.

[02:52:59.819 --> 02:53:00.359]  You worry.
[02:53:00.739 --> 02:53:02.459]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[02:53:02.759 --> 02:53:04.980]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:53:05.300 --> 02:53:07.120]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[02:53:07.380 --> 02:53:08.600]  Your answer may be at hand.
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:12.201]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[02:53:12.581 --> 02:53:17.422]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[02:53:17.822 --> 02:53:21.163]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:53:21.623 --> 02:53:22.964]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:53:23.324 --> 02:53:25.924]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[02:53:26.185 --> 02:53:29.125]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[02:53:29.486 --> 02:53:37.668]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[02:53:37.928 --> 02:53:42.309]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[02:53:52.334 --> 02:53:55.216]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:53:55.717 --> 02:53:57.758]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[02:54:01.901 --> 02:54:08.606]  The establishment wants to divide us along the lines of left and right versus right and wrong versus Constitution and tyranny.
[02:54:09.907 --> 02:54:11.648]  But here's the Hill survey.
[02:54:11.668 --> 02:54:15.531]  4 in 10 Tea Party members are Democrats or Independents.
[02:54:17.358 --> 02:54:21.711]  This is a national poll, scientific poll, by the Winston Group.
