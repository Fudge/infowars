[00:00:00.675 --> 00:00:05.699]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.402]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:09.883 --> 00:00:11.524]  It is the 15th day of March, 2010.
[00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.706]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:20.732]  We're simulcasting the second half of the broadcast at PrisonPlanet.tv for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:00:20.913 --> 00:00:21.173]  Okay.
[00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:27.305]  I've got a lot of important news coming up, but I want to run through a bunch of calls until the bottom of the hour.
[00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.327]  I'm going to get back into fluoride.
[00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:31.049]  Big developments on that front.
[00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.113]  Also, this is an article here out of the Boston Herald.
[00:00:36.534 --> 00:00:39.416]  Child rape charge rocks TSA.
[00:00:39.557 --> 00:00:43.640]  Logan employee pats down air travelers at scan stations.
[00:00:44.568 --> 00:00:48.990]  Naked body scanner person charged with raping a child.
[00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.131]  Folks, who do you think is attracted to be a truancy officer?
[00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:55.532]  Who do you think is attracted to be a Boy Scout leader?
[00:00:55.852 --> 00:00:58.193]  Who do you think is attracted to be a CPS worker?
[00:00:58.493 --> 00:01:00.674]  Who do you think is attracted to be a TSA worker?
[00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:03.395]  I've watched the videos on the news and I've seen it myself.
[00:01:03.435 --> 00:01:04.856]  They now grab women's breasts.
[00:01:04.896 --> 00:01:06.676]  We were shown that video yesterday.
[00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:08.337]  They rub under the breast.
[00:01:09.874 --> 00:01:14.156]  And they grab your genitals and you see them on the news in front of cameras.
[00:01:14.176 --> 00:01:19.098]  They single out the hot blonde and put her in the body scanner and the guys all gather around and laugh.
[00:01:19.138 --> 00:01:21.079]  I mean, this is going on!
[00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.502]  Who do you think they hired for Abu Ghraib outside Baghdad?
[00:01:26.522 --> 00:01:30.465]  Who do you think they hired for Camp X-Ray in the internal CIA camp within the camp?
[00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:32.607]  The Marines that are there aren't really bad.
[00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:35.769]  They're just called from regular Marines, but the inner group.
[00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.034]  It came out in the news they hire fired federal and state jail guards who've been caught raping inmates.
[00:01:42.814 --> 00:01:43.275]  Sadist!
[00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.543]  I mean, you know, down in the dungeon they've got evil dungeon keepers.
[00:01:47.643 --> 00:01:49.045]  I mean, who else could do this?
[00:01:49.485 --> 00:01:54.091]  Even if people were evil and bad in dungeons, I wouldn't enjoy torturing them.
[00:01:54.932 --> 00:01:56.514]  Well, I'm not going to be a dungeon keeper.
[00:01:58.236 --> 00:01:59.257]  If somebody's really evil,
[00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.571]  And when we've got all the proof, I say string them up, let's just get them out of the way.
[00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:07.852]  And even if it was an evil person, I wouldn't enjoy seeing them hang from the end of a rope.
[00:02:08.153 --> 00:02:09.613]  It'd be like stepping on a cockroach.
[00:02:10.453 --> 00:02:12.754]  I turn the bathroom light on, there's some giant cockroach.
[00:02:13.594 --> 00:02:16.835]  I go, man, I don't want to have to stomp on this and pick up the guts.
[00:02:16.935 --> 00:02:21.977]  And even though I don't like cockroaches, it's a life form, I don't enjoy stomping on it.
[00:02:21.997 --> 00:02:27.879]  I just do it as quickly as possible, get some toilet paper, pick it up, throw it in the toilet, flush it, wash my hands, ugh.
[00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:32.062]  You know, it's 3 a.m., you get up to relieve your bladder, you stumble in.
[00:02:32.082 --> 00:02:33.423]  What's happened to everybody?
[00:02:33.443 --> 00:02:35.643]  You flip the light on, there's a giant cockroach on the wall.
[00:02:35.663 --> 00:02:37.824]  You're like, oh, you little creature.
[00:02:37.864 --> 00:02:39.445]  You pick a magazine up, splat.
[00:02:40.185 --> 00:02:42.086]  Well, there are a lot of people that enjoy that.
[00:02:42.426 --> 00:02:48.668]  It's like George W. Bush would stick firecrackers in the rear ends of toads.
[00:02:48.688 --> 00:02:52.009]  This is on record admitted, and enjoyed blowing their guts out everywhere.
[00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.911]  Jeffrey Dahmer enjoyed torturing animals.
[00:02:55.312 --> 00:02:58.634]  Now, then the globalists try to ban hunting, though, and say that's what that is.
[00:02:58.674 --> 00:03:00.736]  No, this is that you get off on shooting the deer.
[00:03:01.016 --> 00:03:04.879]  It's the natural instinct to go out and hunt, and to skin it, and then to eat it.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.984]  Like a dog isn't being cruel when it wants to chase down, say, a rat.
[00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:13.425]  Dogs are even better than cats at actually ratting.
[00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:15.367]  If you get like a terrier, that's what they're bred for.
[00:03:16.608 --> 00:03:18.149]  To them, it's instinct, and they want to eat it.
[00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:19.410]  They're a carnivore.
[00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:27.478]  But people that like to get little animals and, you know, torture them and do things to them, something's wrong with them.
[00:03:28.118 --> 00:03:31.260]  And that's the type of people that end up in government.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.581]  Now, am I saying every truancy officer is a pedophile?
[00:03:34.762 --> 00:03:35.422]  Absolutely not.
[00:03:36.242 --> 00:03:38.343]  Am I saying every jail guard's a sadist?
[00:03:38.463 --> 00:03:39.024]  Absolutely not.
[00:03:39.564 --> 00:03:46.127]  A lot of them are like my great-uncle, three-time retiree, 25 years in the Army as an officer, mid-level.
[00:03:48.106 --> 00:03:50.547]  He then went to work for the post office, I think, for 10 years.
[00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:54.967]  And then for another, what, 10, he was a state of Texas jail guard.
[00:03:55.888 --> 00:03:56.628]  And he got out.
[00:03:56.668 --> 00:03:57.828]  He said, oh, it's just horrible.
[00:03:57.868 --> 00:04:02.629]  He said some of the guards, I've sat around eating dinner with him, some of the guards are worse than the inmates.
[00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:07.590]  And he talks about that, how that's why he got out of it.
[00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:15.832]  I mean, he said he got along with the prisoners and found that on most cases they were better than the guards and that the prisoners take care of the real scum, the really bad inmates.
[00:04:16.332 --> 00:04:17.792]  But look, side issue.
[00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:21.142]  So I'm not saying every jail guard's a bad person.
[00:04:21.162 --> 00:04:22.743]  A lot of them are just people that want a job.
[00:04:23.443 --> 00:04:32.284]  You know, they got plenty of money, they're a retiree, but you know, they're out of the army and they're 50 years old, they become a jail guard or whatever.
[00:04:33.184 --> 00:04:40.246]  In fact, there's a London Telegraph headline, Corrupt Prison Guards Fuel Drug Culture.
[00:04:41.126 --> 00:04:47.447]  And boy, my great uncle, he'll talk about how citizens are in there, in jail,
[00:04:48.613 --> 00:04:51.534]  In state prison for their first drunk driving charge.
[00:04:52.154 --> 00:04:53.475]  They don't get the right lawyer, it happens.
[00:04:53.695 --> 00:04:55.335]  And how the illegals are all above the law.
[00:04:55.795 --> 00:05:03.658]  And how they'll be nice family people, you name it, had three beers at the country club, got in their car, got pulled over, got convicted.
[00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:09.579]  He talked about a lot of people, first time offenders.
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.080]  Side issue.
[00:05:13.191 --> 00:05:14.912]  I said I was going to get into this news.
[00:05:15.012 --> 00:05:22.157]  It's just a naked body scanner operator who has now been charged with raping a child.
[00:05:22.778 --> 00:05:24.899]  Folks, I read the newspaper every day.
[00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:27.161]  Every day!
[00:05:27.721 --> 00:05:29.062]  I scan over hundreds of papers.
[00:05:29.102 --> 00:05:30.123]  I got a whole staff doing it.
[00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.624]  They send me all this information.
[00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:33.706]  Listeners tweet these articles at me.
[00:05:34.006 --> 00:05:35.467]  I mean, I'm addicted just to reading it all.
[00:05:35.927 --> 00:05:42.552]  I see stuff every day or two without looking where top CPS workers are caught molesting children
[00:05:43.891 --> 00:05:47.994]  Child porn, hardcore snuff films, you name it, and it swept under the rug.
[00:05:48.534 --> 00:05:59.702]  But then meanwhile, and even Walsh talked about this with Obama, about, it was weird, he said, you know, we're not talking about the sex offenders that get caught peeing at Mardi Gras.
[00:06:00.862 --> 00:06:04.265]  We're not talking about an 18-year-old who, you know, is dating a 16-year-old.
[00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:05.406]  Well, yes you are.
[00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:07.387]  That's who most of the sex offenders are.
[00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:11.650]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have seen hundreds of news articles where people
[00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:18.994]  Pull over in the middle of a rural area and go pee behind a bush, and the police pull up and arrest you, and you are a sex offender.
[00:06:19.354 --> 00:06:32.004]  Ladies and gentlemen, I mean, if you live in Texas, and you're driving 100, 200, 300 miles to go somewhere, how many, everybody's driving down the road and seeing cars pulled off, and you see people behind the bushes.
[00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:35.487]  I mean, how many of you have peed behind the bushes?
[00:06:35.507 --> 00:06:36.828]  That is not sex offense.
[00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:40.591]  And then meanwhile,
[00:06:42.366 --> 00:06:43.427]  I'll never forget the Florida case.
[00:06:43.727 --> 00:06:45.929]  3,400 missing kids that CPS had taken.
[00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:51.635]  They found a bunch of them dead in different parts of the country in shallow graves, heads cut off, all sorts of crazy stuff.
[00:06:52.635 --> 00:06:58.941]  And it turned out that the director was a pedophile, and then the next guy they hired was a pedophile, and the next guy they hired was a pedophile group.
[00:07:00.262 --> 00:07:03.405]  And I'm telling you, it's the people running all these anti-pedophile groups.
[00:07:03.806 --> 00:07:04.847]  You can look at them.
[00:07:05.677 --> 00:07:08.519]  They've all got that weird little demonic look in their eyes.
[00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:09.159]  I don't know what it is.
[00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:11.401]  It's like a little... I mean, I can't even do the look.
[00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:21.207]  It's like a... It's like a... Let me try to... I can imitate almost anything, but it's hard to get... It's like a... I don't know.
[00:07:21.247 --> 00:07:21.828]  I can't do it.
[00:07:22.268 --> 00:07:27.211]  Pull up... Pull up that Congressman Foley.
[00:07:28.713 --> 00:07:29.213]  Pull him up.
[00:07:31.214 --> 00:07:32.075]  Going after the pages.
[00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:36.773]  I mean, they've all got that look, and I'm telling you, it's incredible.
[00:07:36.793 --> 00:07:42.757]  I don't know what the, I don't know what, it's like a bug-eyed look, and they're always like, mmm, like demonic rats or something.
[00:07:43.277 --> 00:07:50.041]  And of course, he was the head of the child abuse thing in Congress, and he was helping get all these laws passed, blah, blah, blah.
[00:07:50.722 --> 00:07:58.847]  Of course, when you've got people going after kids, they're gonna be in the position of protecting the kids, because no one will believe that they're involved in it.
[00:07:58.927 --> 00:07:59.967]  All right, I'm already ranting.
[00:08:00.248 --> 00:08:02.009]  By the way, Jason Burma's covered some of that in his
[00:08:06.573 --> 00:08:07.593]  Invisible Empire film.
[00:08:09.674 --> 00:08:10.955]  Skip in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:08:12.416 --> 00:08:13.336]  Hey, Joe.
[00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:14.216]  How are you doing?
[00:08:14.777 --> 00:08:14.997]  Good.
[00:08:15.137 --> 00:08:17.658]  I'm going to add two things real quick.
[00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:23.481]  One, here's something I think we need to think about as far as the problem with Mexico.
[00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:30.864]  I'm a heavy haul driver and for years I've been bringing stuff out to Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.
[00:08:31.209 --> 00:08:37.831]  They have built that base up over the last 10 years to house over 120,000 troops.
[00:08:38.131 --> 00:08:38.951]  There are no troops there.
[00:08:39.851 --> 00:08:45.392]  We are hauling huge cable that is being put into the ground.
[00:08:45.512 --> 00:08:48.433]  This is internet cable.
[00:08:48.513 --> 00:08:50.213]  It's satellite cable.
[00:08:50.534 --> 00:08:52.554]  It's over a foot in diameter.
[00:08:52.914 --> 00:08:53.734]  It's massive.
[00:08:54.314 --> 00:08:56.675]  And they're putting this cable in throughout the entire country.
[00:08:57.108 --> 00:08:57.469]  I think so.
[00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:15.727]  They have built huge airstrips there.
[00:09:16.007 --> 00:09:17.527]  There are Russian aircraft there.
[00:09:17.608 --> 00:09:24.690]  I've seen the... No, listen, it's been all over the news that they're militarizing the border, but leaving it open to control the drugs coming in.
[00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.071]  It's part of the Napa superhighway system.
[00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:33.874]  They're building giant bases everywhere, and it's to keep the American people out, and to make sure all the illegals can come in.
[00:09:35.955 --> 00:09:41.377]  And one more thing, I would like your take on what's going on with Iran with the letter
[00:09:42.938 --> 00:09:52.241]  That Albert Pike wrote the three wars, the Third World War, describes perfectly what they're doing in Iran, and I would like your two cents on that.
[00:09:52.321 --> 00:09:52.582]  Thank you.
[00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:55.680]  Well, they are trying to start World War III.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:04.022]  The RAND Corporation last year said that the globalists need a new war, bigger than the Iraq war, to basically sell their new world order.
[00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:10.863]  Because during a war, even if the government's involved in tyranny, people tend to just hunker down, it's a primitive instinct, and just do what they're told.
[00:10:11.503 --> 00:10:14.984]  Because the real target is the United States to set up this domestic grid.
[00:10:16.425 --> 00:10:19.145]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ronnie in Texas.
[00:10:19.225 --> 00:10:19.926]  Ronnie, you're on the air.
[00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:30.988]  We've received the Fluoride-Free Underwear Patriot, but hey, seriously, the escalating Mexican drug war is our road to liberation, Alex.
[00:10:31.728 --> 00:10:34.570]  Because we can all agree, stop the killing.
[00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.113]  Stick to the Constitution, which, of course, like our Bill of Rights, was written on hemp paper.
[00:10:39.153 --> 00:10:41.834]  Stop the killing with freedom for farmers.
[00:10:42.415 --> 00:10:43.475]  The criminals have blown it.
[00:10:43.896 --> 00:10:50.540]  And here comes the freedom for farmers, because everyone can realize the idiocy now of this ongoing war on pot smokers and over
[00:10:51.089 --> 00:10:58.573]  Twenty-five percent of our jail now full of non-violent marijuana offenders, and fourteen states have already legalized medicinal marijuana.
[00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:10.480]  So we all can agree to stop the killing thanks to this Mexican drug-reward explosion that put it into the news, despite our usual news media blackout on this issue.
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:16.063]  So if absolute freedom for farmers is our best chance, you know, the thirteen colonies started
[00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:17.543]  The whole thing over here.
[00:11:17.583 --> 00:11:22.215]  Now 14 states, the citizens have overwhelmingly voted to legalize themselves!
[00:11:23.839 --> 00:11:26.361]  And we're the government, we're the people.
[00:11:26.761 --> 00:11:32.226]  We can pass whatever law, repeal whatever law we want, as long as it doesn't violate somebody else's rights under the Bill of Rights.
[00:11:32.526 --> 00:11:34.448]  We're the boss, not the government.
[00:11:34.728 --> 00:11:45.317]  And the feds come into 14 states and say, no, you're not going to decriminalize marijuana, we're going to keep the drug war going so we can continue to make money off it, because when it's illegal they make bigger profits.
[00:11:45.377 --> 00:11:46.278]  Ronnie, good to hear from you.
[00:11:46.318 --> 00:11:48.119]  Mark, Leo, Scott, Patrick.

[00:12:19.969 --> 00:12:23.890]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.

[00:12:26.811 --> 00:12:27.711]  It was empowering.
[00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:31.732]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.

[00:14:13.384 --> 00:14:19.585]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:14:19.785 --> 00:14:24.806]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:14:25.327 --> 00:14:34.949]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:37.189]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:14:37.429 --> 00:14:38.750]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.290]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.311]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:48.412]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:15:56.401 --> 00:15:58.623]  Wow!
[00:16:06.429 --> 00:16:08.491]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:10.316 --> 00:16:21.166]  What we have is a criminal class that makes a bunch of rules that make normal, regular, good people criminals, so the criminals have an excuse to put us in their prisons and have their way with us.
[00:16:22.287 --> 00:16:25.290]  Here's Foley's I Am Exchange with underage Paige.
[00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.192]  That guy didn't get in any trouble.
[00:16:28.072 --> 00:16:33.137]  And he was running all the child programs to save children from perverts in Congress.
[00:16:36.499 --> 00:16:38.243]  I mean, you constantly hear about congressmen.
[00:16:38.383 --> 00:16:39.145]  Who was the other one?
[00:16:39.385 --> 00:16:40.227]  In the bathroom?
[00:16:41.851 --> 00:16:42.712]  Larry Craig?
[00:16:42.732 --> 00:16:45.078]  I mean, it's just...
[00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:49.828]  The issue is, why is it so many of them?
[00:16:49.848 --> 00:16:52.590]  Because it's a club, and that's who they let in.
[00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:57.173]  And so, of course you've got Child Rape Charge Rocks TSA.
[00:16:57.193 --> 00:16:59.254]  This is out of the Boston Herald.
[00:16:59.574 --> 00:17:04.738]  Logan employee pats down air travelers at scan stations.
[00:17:05.498 --> 00:17:07.039]  This is where they have the naked body scanners.
[00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:08.100]  In fact, give me a document cam.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:08.480]  There it is.
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.142]  Child Rape Charge Rocks TSA, Boston Herald.
[00:17:12.162 --> 00:17:13.923]  I'm going to get more into this coming up.
[00:17:16.365 --> 00:17:25.493]  Who wants a job for $15 an hour where you've got to squeeze women's breasts, grab men's genitals, and naked body scan children?
[00:17:26.313 --> 00:17:29.456]  I mean, you couldn't pay me a million dollars to do that.
[00:17:30.537 --> 00:17:34.260]  I mean, I don't like to inconvenience a waiter to say, hey, my food isn't good.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.782]  I'll just tend to not go back to the restaurant.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.424]  Yeah, my food's bad because I don't like to get in people's faces unless they're in my face.
[00:17:42.985 --> 00:17:44.066]  But these people love it.
[00:17:44.086 --> 00:17:52.194]  I mean, day after day, hour after hour, week after week, month after month, year after year, searching and squeezing and scanning and getting in your face.
[00:17:52.675 --> 00:17:55.537]  Now, a lot of them are mainly veterans and people that just want a job.
[00:17:56.363 --> 00:17:57.343]  But a big percentage.
[00:17:57.644 --> 00:18:03.566]  I mean, we see the articles of them telling teenage girls, I want you to be my sex slave, so they get in trouble.
[00:18:04.106 --> 00:18:06.747]  Or going crazy saying, I'm God, I'm God.
[00:18:06.767 --> 00:18:07.568]  Remember a month ago?
[00:18:08.208 --> 00:18:11.189]  TSA worker just went insane and said, I'm God, I'm God!
[00:18:11.229 --> 00:18:14.431]  The airport was running around going so insane they had to arrest him.
[00:18:14.751 --> 00:18:16.311]  Just lunatics who want to be God.
[00:18:16.772 --> 00:18:18.752]  And so they are God in that airport.
[00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:24.635]  And you're going to be naked body scanned by a person who's been arrested for child rape.
[00:18:25.933 --> 00:18:26.794]  Alleged child rape.
[00:18:28.435 --> 00:18:30.697]  I mean, I'm telling you, these are perverts.
[00:18:31.338 --> 00:18:32.639]  I've seen the news footage.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.620]  They don't even hide it.
[00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:39.025]  They pick the good-looking women out, send them in, and then just start going, mmm.
[00:18:39.386 --> 00:18:43.830]  And then in England, the movie star guy goes through the scanner.
[00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.993]  They print off his naked body and ask him to come give them an autograph on it.
[00:18:51.462 --> 00:18:52.183]  That's the women.
[00:18:52.763 --> 00:18:58.448]  We're so dehumanized, women would record our naked body and then bring it to a man and say, sign this.
[00:18:58.468 --> 00:19:04.532]  And the guy was so cool, showing how men are a lot cooler on these issues than women, and signed it.
[00:19:04.693 --> 00:19:06.754]  And he should have become absolutely outraged.
[00:19:07.755 --> 00:19:09.236]  Because what he did wasn't cool.
[00:19:09.516 --> 00:19:11.918]  He just thinks it's cool to just make a joke out of it.
[00:19:12.158 --> 00:19:13.119]  It was oppressive.
[00:19:13.399 --> 00:19:15.141]  It was a form of humiliation.
[00:19:17.233 --> 00:19:21.534]  And if it's already so bad today, where is it going next?
[00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:23.315]  Mark in Michigan, you're on the air.
[00:19:24.715 --> 00:19:33.297]  Hey Alex, I got a powerful idea I want to let loose, and you're the big point of contact for this whole thing.
[00:19:35.398 --> 00:19:46.401]  You know, a lot of people are waking up, but you know, we can't be so pure if you forget that there's a lot of people on the left, you know, people like Naomi Wolf, like Percentage.
[00:19:46.966 --> 00:19:52.130]  I've met kids that are Democrats that are starting to get scared.
[00:19:54.872 --> 00:19:56.373]  I think it's time we organize.
[00:19:57.814 --> 00:20:02.037]  It's time for a real third party to get a point of agreement.
[00:20:02.557 --> 00:20:10.743]  Guys like Bob Barr, Baldwin, Paul, Ventura, Naomi Wolf is a great person to talk to lefties.
[00:20:11.824 --> 00:20:15.627]  I'd love to see your show put some of these guys together.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.001]  Well, let me just say, I don't trust Bob Barr.
[00:20:22.422 --> 00:20:31.265]  And it's not just because he was CIA, it's that he now is this big patriot leader, but still has supported some bad things in the past.
[00:20:31.725 --> 00:20:38.807]  Not because he's former CIA, there's some good guys out there, analysts and people, like Ray McGovern, who's got a good track record, and are for real.
[00:20:39.587 --> 00:20:41.788]  Naomi Wolf was a Rhodes Scholar, she's come on the show.
[00:20:42.688 --> 00:20:44.189]  She stood up against Bush's corruption.
[00:20:44.229 --> 00:20:46.970]  She started speaking out against Obama, so that's a feather in her cap.
[00:20:47.511 --> 00:20:49.832]  But I do think we should be non-partisan about this.
[00:20:49.892 --> 00:20:53.034]  I mean, my whole issue is about shattering the left-right paradigm.
[00:20:53.454 --> 00:21:00.058]  But more than just a third party, we need to just run through the Republican and Democratic system, or third party, whatever works for you locally.
[00:21:00.678 --> 00:21:04.060]  Use the party machinery to get in as a constitutionalist.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.441]  Kind of like Deborah Medina.
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.982]  She's more of a libertarian, but run as a Republican because that's the party that has the best chance of winning in Texas.
[00:21:11.042 --> 00:21:11.742]  It's just a label.
[00:21:11.782 --> 00:21:12.382]  It means nothing.
[00:21:12.742 --> 00:21:13.643]  But I do agree with you.
[00:21:15.263 --> 00:21:18.785]  You know, just to get these people, just agree on five things.
[00:21:19.105 --> 00:21:23.566]  The Bill of Rights, the paper ballot, and the Fed, and the war, secure the borders.
[00:21:23.646 --> 00:21:24.907]  Forget about all this other stuff.
[00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:26.908]  I agree, and you're right.
[00:21:26.928 --> 00:21:30.129]  A lot of lefties that were in love with Obama have now woken up.
[00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:31.409]  In fact, the majority of them in polls.
[00:21:32.089 --> 00:21:32.950]  And they're really getting...
[00:21:34.258 --> 00:21:35.919]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:21:35.939 --> 00:21:37.140]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:00.959 --> 00:22:04.603]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:22:04.983 --> 00:22:07.987]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:22:08.227 --> 00:22:13.012]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:13.032 --> 00:22:19.299]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:19.419 --> 00:22:21.662]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:22:22.162 --> 00:22:22.482]  Tim Geithner?
[00:22:22.502 --> 00:22:22.923]  Bernanke?
[00:22:23.003 --> 00:22:23.623]  They're arsonists!
[00:22:23.683 --> 00:22:24.944]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:24.964 --> 00:22:27.206]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:41.095 --> 00:22:48.037]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:22:48.357 --> 00:22:57.480]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:23:01.397 --> 00:23:05.018]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:23:05.358 --> 00:23:13.479]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:23:14.219 --> 00:23:18.240]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:29.662]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:23:30.282 --> 00:23:39.305]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:23:39.805 --> 00:23:44.847]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:23:45.227 --> 00:23:52.410]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:55.471]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:23:59.292 --> 00:24:03.534]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:24:03.854 --> 00:24:04.475]  Number one.
[00:24:04.755 --> 00:24:07.916]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:24:08.176 --> 00:24:08.757]  Number two.
[00:24:09.057 --> 00:24:13.599]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:24:13.939 --> 00:24:14.379]  It's true.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:19.242]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:24:19.542 --> 00:24:20.083]  Number 3.
[00:24:20.363 --> 00:24:23.666]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:24:23.967 --> 00:24:27.711]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:24:27.871 --> 00:24:28.431]  Number 4.
[00:24:28.672 --> 00:24:31.054]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:24:31.434 --> 00:24:34.838]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:24:35.118 --> 00:24:35.319]  Number 5.
[00:24:35.899 --> 00:24:39.821]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:44.803]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:25:15.335 --> 00:25:20.719]  We're gonna have open phones throughout the rest of the broadcast and start getting into more of these stacks of news here.
[00:25:33.348 --> 00:25:40.137]  I wanted, before we go back to your calls, to thank some of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[00:25:40.157 --> 00:25:48.709]  The number one funding mechanism, of course, is the books and DVDs and Patriot t-shirts we sell at InfoWars.com.
[00:25:48.749 --> 00:25:50.411]  Great books, great films, excellent...
[00:25:51.172 --> 00:25:51.572]  Clothing.
[00:25:51.592 --> 00:25:53.514]  Where you'll meet like-minded people.
[00:25:53.534 --> 00:25:54.455]  I mean, it's a great way to wear it.
[00:25:54.515 --> 00:25:58.098]  InfoWars.com ball cap or bumper stickers are free with all the orders.
[00:25:58.438 --> 00:26:02.762]  The t-shirts all available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:26:02.782 --> 00:26:02.822]  888-253-3139.
[00:26:02.842 --> 00:26:04.344]  You can also write to me, InfoWars, P.O.
[00:26:04.364 --> 00:26:04.824]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:26:17.435 --> 00:26:17.655]  P.O.
[00:26:17.675 --> 00:26:21.939]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:28.244]  And don't forget, you can now pre-order Jason Bermas' new film.
[00:26:29.125 --> 00:26:30.066]  You'll be the first to get it.
[00:26:30.486 --> 00:26:32.448]  We ship the orders out and the order they're received.
[00:26:33.428 --> 00:26:35.931]  April 15th, ladies and gentlemen, is the DVD drop date.
[00:26:35.951 --> 00:26:40.695]  It'll also premiere at PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality for all the members.
[00:26:40.755 --> 00:26:42.436]  Invisible Empire, a new order to find.
[00:26:42.456 --> 00:26:44.478]  And then seven days later,
[00:26:46.434 --> 00:27:01.293]  On the 21st, we release Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, my newest film that I directed with Rob Due and Jason Douglas.
[00:27:02.074 --> 00:27:03.615]  Film turned out really powerful.
[00:27:04.684 --> 00:27:05.925]  Just look at all the stuff that's happening.
[00:27:05.965 --> 00:27:08.267]  It's unfortunate that everything we talked about came true.
[00:27:08.527 --> 00:27:10.669]  In fact, give me a document cam shot.
[00:27:10.689 --> 00:27:11.970]  This will be up in the next few hours.
[00:27:13.011 --> 00:27:17.515]  You can already pre-order Invisible Empire, but this will be up for pre-order in the next few hours.
[00:27:17.755 --> 00:27:20.878]  Here's the cover that's been sent off to be printed with the DVDs.
[00:27:22.479 --> 00:27:25.682]  Police state for the rise of FEMA.
[00:27:26.162 --> 00:27:27.043]  Tyranny is here.
[00:27:27.203 --> 00:27:29.826]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:27:32.745 --> 00:27:38.527]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth, and it's only getting worse.
[00:27:38.567 --> 00:27:42.628]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[00:27:43.768 --> 00:27:50.870]  Veteran documentary filmmaker Alex Jones inclusively proves the existence of secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:56.091]  The military industrial complex is transforming our once free nation into a giant prison camp.
[00:27:56.451 --> 00:28:01.533]  A cashless society control grid constructed in the name of fighting terrorism has actually been built.
[00:28:02.253 --> 00:28:02.613]  We're good.
[00:28:16.601 --> 00:28:41.206]  ...has established an all-powerful shadow state, prepared to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, FEMA camps, and a shredded Constitution, witnessed police and military savagely attacking innocent citizens as our own government unleashes false flag operations to justify its oppression, then watches Alex Jones takes on corrupt mercenary police and exposes mainstream media brainwashing, i.e.
[00:28:42.219 --> 00:28:43.060]  Glenn Beck.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.922]  It is Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:28:47.323 --> 00:28:48.804]  Pre-sales start today.
[00:28:49.124 --> 00:28:52.446]  That ships out on or before April 21st.
[00:28:52.466 --> 00:28:53.367]  And why do you want to order now?
[00:28:53.387 --> 00:28:54.508]  So you get it first.
[00:28:54.528 --> 00:28:57.630]  It's shipped out in the order it is received.
[00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:58.571]  We've gotten pretty quick now.
[00:28:58.631 --> 00:29:01.413]  We can ship out the pre-orders within four days.
[00:29:02.523 --> 00:29:07.606]  And so we try to start shipping two or three days before, so basically almost everybody gets it on that date or a little bit after.
[00:29:07.987 --> 00:29:12.450]  And again, your purchase of these books and DVDs and materials makes what we do here possible.
[00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:18.854]  It's all available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:29:18.914 --> 00:29:22.136]  Or you can, again, write to me, InfoWars, P.O.
[00:29:22.156 --> 00:29:25.238]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[00:29:25.819 --> 00:29:27.660]  Okay, let's go back to the calls.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.421]  Leo in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[00:29:30.842 --> 00:29:31.702]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:29:31.722 --> 00:29:32.123]  How are you?
[00:29:32.797 --> 00:29:34.037]  Oh, man, I am tired today.
[00:29:34.057 --> 00:29:34.938]  That's all I'm doing.
[00:29:35.618 --> 00:29:40.879]  Listen, everything that you just mentioned about all these things that are going on in the world... Do me a huge favor.
[00:29:40.919 --> 00:29:41.999]  Turn your radio off, man.
[00:29:42.019 --> 00:29:45.600]  I really want to be able to hear you.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.080]  It's off.
[00:29:46.681 --> 00:29:47.281]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:29:47.361 --> 00:29:48.741]  Now it's off.
[00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:55.863]  Anyway, everything you just mentioned, of course, is, you know, stark naked reality that we all have to deal with in this world.
[00:29:56.503 --> 00:29:58.283]  But there's a new one you can add to it.
[00:29:58.784 --> 00:30:00.144]  They're sending notices out.
[00:30:00.962 --> 00:30:05.405]  All the veterans that are like I'm on a service-connected pension with the VA.
[00:30:06.226 --> 00:30:10.329]  They're sending notices out to all the veterans telling you got to come in for testing.
[00:30:11.189 --> 00:30:20.116]  Now my letter didn't state this, but I have a few friends of mine that the letter stated that if they didn't show up for the testing that they were going to stop their money.
[00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.673]  So you see, here's another way... Now you're talking... Well, I mean, I've seen this.
[00:30:24.733 --> 00:30:25.814]  Clinton started this.
[00:30:26.335 --> 00:30:35.362]  It was 89,000 names of vets who they claimed had PTSD from Vietnam and Korea and Desert Storm in 98.
[00:30:35.642 --> 00:30:37.984]  No, no, that was 99.
[00:30:38.685 --> 00:30:45.090]  And suddenly, it was... No, no, it was... Yeah, it was 99.
[00:30:45.791 --> 00:30:47.933]  Suddenly, they couldn't buy firearms.
[00:30:49.193 --> 00:30:50.714]  And no judge, no jury.
[00:30:50.754 --> 00:30:55.218]  Now they have the no-fly, no-buy bill they want to pass, where if they put you on a no-fly list, you can't buy guns.
[00:30:55.598 --> 00:30:57.100]  No judge, no jury, no conviction.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:05.306]  And yes, I've been getting calls about these letters in the last month that they're telling them, you've got to come in for PTSD to see if you've got PTSD.
[00:31:05.326 --> 00:31:07.048]  And then an unelected quack
[00:31:07.728 --> 00:31:08.249]  Exactly.
[00:31:08.409 --> 00:31:13.815]  You know, what they're trying to do, in my opinion, is they're trying to control every one of us in some way or fashion.
[00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:32.395]  Yeah, if they can't get you in the criminal justice system, they want to get you in the credit system, bankrupt.
[00:31:32.675 --> 00:31:34.697]  Or they want to get you in the psychological system.
[00:31:35.358 --> 00:31:36.659]  This is how they take your rights.
[00:31:36.719 --> 00:31:38.161]  They designate everyone as bad.
[00:31:38.201 --> 00:31:38.541]  Go ahead.
[00:31:39.322 --> 00:31:46.390]  But anyway, you know, the bottom line is, is that what I'm trying to do right now is get together with a lot of veterans.
[00:31:46.969 --> 00:31:57.041]  And then I don't mean I don't really know what approach to take if it's useless to go to a politician and ask one of them to try to support us because you know they're just going to sell us down.
[00:31:57.061 --> 00:32:03.909]  Well, let me say this, Leo, and then I want to shut up and let you have a few minutes to actually lay out what your friend told you.
[00:32:03.969 --> 00:32:06.512]  But it's like the last two, three months.
[00:32:08.038 --> 00:32:10.880]  We keep getting calls from scared women, mainly.
[00:32:11.661 --> 00:32:17.805]  And being a talk show host for 14 plus years, you really learn to gauge if someone's being truthful about 99% of the time.
[00:32:18.106 --> 00:32:22.549]  You can tell when somebody's feeding you a line of bull by what they say, how they say it, their tone.
[00:32:22.949 --> 00:32:27.933]  But when you have woman after woman after woman, or cops, I've had cops calling on air.
[00:32:28.433 --> 00:32:32.637]  Yeah, we're down here, we're not supposed to talk about it, there are weird Russian helicopters flying around.
[00:32:33.317 --> 00:32:34.357]  And I'm like, who's in them?
[00:32:34.518 --> 00:32:37.279]  I don't know, they just look like Russian helicopters off TV.
[00:32:37.739 --> 00:32:39.980]  They're white, they're gray, they're black.
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.701]  Caller after caller, a lot of you heard them here on air.
[00:32:43.441 --> 00:32:53.646]  And then it comes out, San Antonio Express News, video of it, Russian helicopters flown by the Mexican Navy, European helicopters flown by the Mexican Army, you know, five, six miles over the U.S.
[00:32:53.686 --> 00:32:55.827]  border, hovering over houses.
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.300]  I knew that was true when I heard it.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.321]  It's like when a preacher called me and said, I've got secret FEMA documents.
[00:33:01.821 --> 00:33:02.761]  This is really scary.
[00:33:02.781 --> 00:33:05.442]  They called us in and said, teach your flock for martial law.
[00:33:05.902 --> 00:33:09.103]  I could tell the guy was telling the truth, but we got the documents, called the phone numbers.
[00:33:09.223 --> 00:33:09.763]  It was real.
[00:33:10.023 --> 00:33:11.403]  FEMA was very upset that we had it.
[00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:15.764]  I knew when cops sent me the Homeland Security document last year and the MIAC report.
[00:33:15.844 --> 00:33:16.984]  I knew it was real when I saw it.
[00:33:17.324 --> 00:33:19.925]  I knew these were real cops when I was talking to them off air on the phone.
[00:33:20.905 --> 00:33:23.286]  But I still called the FBI and found out it was real.
[00:33:23.326 --> 00:33:24.326]  They got real mad I had it.
[00:33:25.046 --> 00:33:33.374]  So, I mean, I've learned when something's real, and so I can tell you're telling the truth, and I've gotten a bunch of calls and emails about this, but people need to do the next step.
[00:33:33.954 --> 00:33:42.202]  They need to send a ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com, or AaronAtInfoWars.com, CC it to a few of us, because we miss some stuff, there's so much, thousands a day.
[00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:59.054]  Someone needs to black out their name, black out their social security numbers, all that stuff, and they need to email it to us right now because we know it was in the news that they're just suddenly putting veterans on lists where they can't own guns.
[00:33:59.494 --> 00:34:06.736]  We know they're calling veterans in at their regular checkups if they volunteer for it and declaring a mentally ill to take their rights away without a court.
[00:34:07.296 --> 00:34:09.756]  And they don't have a law to do that under the Second Amendment.
[00:34:10.057 --> 00:34:11.377]  Now that they have the instant check,
[00:34:12.327 --> 00:34:14.568]  You can't get the gun because the FBI says no.
[00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:15.529]  It's illegal.
[00:34:16.269 --> 00:34:19.691]  And that's why they want to shut down private sales, because veterans can still get guns that way.
[00:34:20.132 --> 00:34:21.833]  So I need people right now.
[00:34:22.673 --> 00:34:29.757]  In fact, when I'm done with Leo, Scott, Patrick and Jason and Stacey, I am not going to take any more calls for about 20 minutes.
[00:34:29.777 --> 00:34:34.000]  We're just going to open the phones up specifically for veterans that this has happened to.
[00:34:35.265 --> 00:34:37.747]  And so you can read it on air, your letter.
[00:34:38.228 --> 00:34:39.869]  Because let's just confirm this right now.
[00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:40.950]  I know what's going on.
[00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:42.651]  I've had a bunch of calls and emails.
[00:34:42.671 --> 00:34:44.233]  I know they've done some of this in the past.
[00:34:44.473 --> 00:34:45.814]  But I want the bonafide.
[00:34:45.914 --> 00:34:46.555]  I want the proof.
[00:34:46.575 --> 00:34:47.655]  Because this is big news.
[00:34:48.036 --> 00:34:50.818]  And we'll get a story up at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:50.838 --> 00:34:51.879]  Now I'm going to shut up, Leo.
[00:34:52.079 --> 00:34:52.760]  You've got two minutes.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.001]  Tell me what your friend was telling you.
[00:34:54.505 --> 00:35:04.733]  He was telling me that it's obvious to him that he had never went to the VA before, okay, about any problems with PTSD or any physical problems.
[00:35:05.114 --> 00:35:06.555]  He was just a normal veteran.
[00:35:07.115 --> 00:35:15.822]  So obviously what's happening is they're going back through the records and they're investigating all of us to find out what we did in Vietnam.
[00:35:16.383 --> 00:35:23.068]  So once they know what we did, then they figure that we have to be into a category where something has to be wrong with us.
[00:35:23.604 --> 00:35:30.528]  And if you're not coming to them and asking them for help in one way or another, then they feel as if you're a dissident.
[00:35:30.988 --> 00:35:35.490]  And that's probably what they're doing to be able to get control of dissidents.
[00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:39.012]  To find out who's who and what position you're taking.
[00:35:39.392 --> 00:35:47.696]  This letter states to me that I'm to report Friday, April 2nd at 3 o'clock for a mis-body image test.
[00:35:48.396 --> 00:35:49.357]  To test my body.
[00:35:50.011 --> 00:35:50.791]  For what reason?
[00:35:51.251 --> 00:35:52.632]  I never set this appointment up.
[00:35:52.892 --> 00:35:54.492]  I never asked for nothing like this.
[00:35:54.893 --> 00:36:01.014]  But they're sending all of us letters like this, telling us that we have to come in for this body imaging testing.
[00:36:01.455 --> 00:36:02.555]  Now, what does that tell you?
[00:36:04.435 --> 00:36:15.579]  Well, I know that over 10 years ago, Pradas in New York and others, big high-end clothing lines, put body scanners in, just like the airports.
[00:36:16.752 --> 00:36:17.913]  The same companies, actually.
[00:36:18.474 --> 00:36:20.356]  This is in the New York Times.
[00:36:21.237 --> 00:36:24.201]  And when you go in, it says, this gives you the ultimate fitting.
[00:36:24.461 --> 00:36:31.549]  You come in, we scan you, and then, this is when this was first coming out, they then have computerized assembly lines.
[00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:36.052]  That make the suit or the dress fit you exactly.
[00:36:36.492 --> 00:36:39.974]  But then it turned out, separately, it was getting a biometric scan of your body.
[00:36:40.395 --> 00:36:48.019]  Just like they take blood from babies at birth secretly for the Pentagon for 37 years and just claim, oh, it's blood testing for your baby.
[00:36:48.699 --> 00:36:50.600]  No, it's sent off to the Health Department and then the Pentagon.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:50.980]  There it is.
[00:36:51.241 --> 00:36:54.402]  Body scanner replaces the tailor's tape measure.
[00:36:54.722 --> 00:36:55.763]  Wow, you guys are quick.
[00:36:56.143 --> 00:36:57.504]  When was that New York Times article?
[00:36:59.485 --> 00:37:00.906]  How did you guys do that in 10 seconds?
[00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:03.550]  I got August 99.
[00:37:04.131 --> 00:37:05.171]  I said 10 years ago?
[00:37:05.432 --> 00:37:06.132]  Look at my memory.
[00:37:06.192 --> 00:37:10.095]  I'm not bragging, folks, but people think I make stuff up because I can just rattle it off.
[00:37:10.355 --> 00:37:10.655]  I don't know.
[00:37:11.155 --> 00:37:11.356]  Look.
[00:37:12.396 --> 00:37:14.578]  Body scanner replaces a tailor's tape measure.
[00:37:14.918 --> 00:37:17.920]  So I have read they are scanning veterans to get your biometric scan.
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:18.881]  Now, why is this important?
[00:37:19.781 --> 00:37:22.763]  They've got top-down heat resonance.
[00:37:23.303 --> 00:37:28.647]  Just by scanning the top of your head, even through your hair, it's like a fingerprint.
[00:37:28.687 --> 00:37:28.807]  It's 100%.
[00:37:30.396 --> 00:37:32.538]  And they've got top-down satellites.
[00:37:33.178 --> 00:37:34.099]  Look-down satellites.
[00:37:34.299 --> 00:37:36.621]  This is the big secret weapon Bob Woodward wrote about in his book.
[00:37:36.661 --> 00:37:38.442]  It's now been partially declassified.
[00:37:39.283 --> 00:37:47.989]  And so once they ID you with the heat resonance, then they have that fingerprint, because it's an exact heat resonance that your head gives off.
[00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:51.552]  They can then top-down with a satellite, even look through clouds.
[00:37:52.773 --> 00:37:53.033]  Okay?
[00:37:53.053 --> 00:37:54.154]  Because this is a heat resonance.
[00:37:54.174 --> 00:37:55.014]  That's how strong these are.
[00:37:55.034 --> 00:37:59.178]  Through clouds, you're walking in a parking lot and they go, that's Alex Jones.
[00:38:00.074 --> 00:38:01.275]  Okay, so they've got that.
[00:38:01.355 --> 00:38:03.037]  Then they've also got biometric walk.
[00:38:03.398 --> 00:38:09.765]  You think they can get your number just off a thumbprint and the six numbers they calculate for a measurement or a face scan template?
[00:38:10.786 --> 00:38:11.787]  Everybody has a walk.
[00:38:11.847 --> 00:38:15.190]  Like, I've had a broken, you know, leg, compound fracture.
[00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:19.192]  And, uh, my doctor died right after the surgery.
[00:38:19.212 --> 00:38:20.634]  I never got the pin and screws out.
[00:38:20.694 --> 00:38:26.019]  So, when I don't think about it, I have to make myself not limp, just because the foot's all shaped wrong.
[00:38:26.739 --> 00:38:29.081]  And, uh, so, so I have that.
[00:38:29.101 --> 00:38:33.185]  You know, I kind of walk like a gorilla sometimes, unless I make myself, you know, walk.
[00:38:34.326 --> 00:38:40.874]  The issue is, is that just off that, they can get a biometric reading 100% just off my one leg.
[00:38:41.234 --> 00:38:46.761]  And see, they'll have a camera that knows the biomechanical movement of Alex Jones's right leg.
[00:38:47.361 --> 00:38:51.686]  Now with the body, once they have this with a body scan, they can
[00:38:52.898 --> 00:38:53.299]  We're good to go.
[00:39:07.796 --> 00:39:10.840]  All this looking for bombs stuff has nothing to do with it.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.304]  Just like when they tell you at the health department, oh, this is a blood test for your baby.
[00:39:14.344 --> 00:39:14.704]  No, it's not.
[00:39:14.744 --> 00:39:15.606]  It's a eugenics test.
[00:39:16.066 --> 00:39:17.508]  But I'm ranting here.
[00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:19.130]  Print me that New York Times.
[00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:20.131]  That's a blast from the past.
[00:39:20.171 --> 00:39:23.395]  I called it, I said, 10 years ago, New York Times, body scanners.
[00:39:23.515 --> 00:39:24.076]  Oh, here it is.
[00:39:24.116 --> 00:39:24.556]  You brought it to me?
[00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:25.710]  Look at this.
[00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:27.251]  Show folks a document cam shot.
[00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:29.612]  Body scanner replaces the tailor's tape measure.
[00:39:29.912 --> 00:39:31.933]  Now, let's expand on that.
[00:39:32.053 --> 00:39:42.637]  Remember last year, all of the Veterans of Foreign Wars outfits were told, we don't care if you have a 150-year-old Civil War cannon, you're going to register it with us, and we may basically take them.
[00:39:42.817 --> 00:39:43.357]  Remember that?
[00:39:43.917 --> 00:39:44.678]  Remember that, Leo?
[00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:52.561]  Well, you know, the bottom line is that I know that you're a very good, moral, decent person.
[00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:58.542]  I meant to tell you we saw you on IFC, the independent film channel, the other night on a program.
[00:39:59.143 --> 00:40:03.927]  Or, you know, the Illuminati and the globalists and the elitists and all these things were being discussed.
[00:40:04.347 --> 00:40:06.530]  And it's nice to see you on mainstream media.
[00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:13.156]  You know, I've been listening to you, me and my friend, for many years, trying to get insight on how to live our lives.
[00:40:13.806 --> 00:40:16.228]  Based on all the problems that are in the world.
[00:40:16.728 --> 00:40:26.777]  And I can only tell you that of everything that I've heard, I just want to say to everybody that's listening today, that the most important thing is, is to accept your higher power.
[00:40:27.297 --> 00:40:32.562]  Almighty God, the Lord Jesus Christ, whatever it is, because his plan is starting to come about.
[00:40:33.062 --> 00:40:39.988]  And the only thing that we can do is try to live our lives as best we possibly can until the man pulls the chain.
[00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:42.052]  And I know you're a busy man.
[00:40:42.072 --> 00:40:43.734]  I don't want to take a lot of your time off.
[00:40:44.174 --> 00:40:56.145]  But before you go with me today, could you put me on with someone there in your office where I can get some information, where we can start getting some films that we can start passing out to our neighbors?
[00:40:57.483 --> 00:40:58.184]  Well, I'm not sure.
[00:40:58.224 --> 00:41:00.305]  I mean, all my films are free online.
[00:41:00.806 --> 00:41:03.067]  They're in higher quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:41:03.588 --> 00:41:08.892]  And people are authorized to make copies of my films, but I can put you on hold and see what you need with John.
[00:41:09.392 --> 00:41:10.653]  Yeah, here it is, BBC.
[00:41:10.993 --> 00:41:12.454]  Camera looks through clothing.
[00:41:14.596 --> 00:41:19.600]  Camera that can see explosives, drugs, weapons, hiding under clothing from 25 meters has been invented.
[00:41:20.641 --> 00:41:22.922]  And if memory serves, this doesn't have a date.
[00:41:22.942 --> 00:41:24.424]  I think this was a few years old here.
[00:41:25.244 --> 00:41:26.105]  What's the date on that?
[00:41:29.711 --> 00:41:31.192]  2008, yeah, a few years ago.
[00:41:31.632 --> 00:41:32.612]  It hasn't been invented.
[00:41:32.632 --> 00:41:33.733]  They've had this for a decade.
[00:41:33.773 --> 00:41:34.993]  This is up all over the place.
[00:41:35.973 --> 00:41:40.055]  And, see, that's why I start ranting, because I just want to warn people.
[00:41:40.095 --> 00:41:41.976]  Do folks realize how evil this is?
[00:41:44.617 --> 00:41:46.577]  And yes, they're calling the veterans in.
[00:41:48.698 --> 00:41:50.199]  They act like you're a friend.
[00:41:50.239 --> 00:41:51.739]  They say, oh, do you ever get angry?
[00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:52.700]  Do you ever get frustrated?
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:53.520]  Are you having trouble?
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.201]  And they say, yeah, I get angry.
[00:41:56.221 --> 00:41:56.801]  I get upset.
[00:41:56.821 --> 00:41:58.382]  You know, my ex-wife's doing this and that.
[00:41:59.684 --> 00:42:08.294]  You know, I'm drinking too much, and the shrink's sitting there going, oh, I'm your friend, and you're going to lose your Second Amendment.
[00:42:08.354 --> 00:42:09.115]  It's totally illegal.
[00:42:09.175 --> 00:42:09.636]  They're doing it.
[00:42:10.457 --> 00:42:12.139]  And they admit they're spying on veterans.
[00:42:12.159 --> 00:42:14.302]  They're worried about you, because you know how to kill.
[00:42:14.962 --> 00:42:16.064]  You know how to defend yourself.
[00:42:16.104 --> 00:42:19.107]  You know it's not that big of a deal, that life is quick.
[00:42:20.219 --> 00:42:21.020]  They're scared of you.
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:21.960]  Okay?
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.042]  I mean, they understand that you've been in it.
[00:42:24.702 --> 00:42:34.629]  And they're a bunch of cowardly control freaks, and all their black uniforms are meant to bolster them up, and their black ski mask and their armor, because they're scared of real men.
[00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:36.671]  And they're scared to death of you.
[00:42:37.892 --> 00:42:40.433]  And it's like when you go in to have a baby.
[00:42:40.473 --> 00:42:44.356]  They have the nurse get the man out of the room and ask your wife, are you having money troubles?
[00:42:44.416 --> 00:42:45.517]  Is your husband mean to you?
[00:42:45.937 --> 00:42:47.538]  She doesn't tell you she's about to call the CPS.
[00:42:49.394 --> 00:42:50.915]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:50.955 --> 00:42:52.617]  On the other side, we'll continue with the phone calls.
[00:42:53.478 --> 00:42:56.160]  And I've got all this news to get to, but I do enjoy your calls.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:57.041]  Stay with us.
[00:43:01.167 --> 00:43:11.754]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[00:43:12.074 --> 00:43:15.977]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[00:43:16.237 --> 00:43:18.058]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[00:43:18.398 --> 00:43:23.842]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[00:43:24.002 --> 00:43:33.788]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[00:43:34.029 --> 00:43:40.293]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[00:43:40.533 --> 00:43:43.855]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[00:43:43.875 --> 00:43:45.696]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:49.058]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[00:43:49.079 --> 00:43:51.180]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:54.423]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:43:54.464 --> 00:43:56.606]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:43:56.626 --> 00:43:58.588]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:44:11.184 --> 00:44:13.845]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:13.865 --> 00:44:20.087]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:20.247 --> 00:44:25.269]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:44:25.449 --> 00:44:35.412]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:44:35.552 --> 00:44:37.653]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:37.893 --> 00:44:39.213]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:39.473 --> 00:44:41.774]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:41.934 --> 00:44:43.775]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:44.075 --> 00:44:48.857]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:44:49.217 --> 00:44:53.999]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:44:54.219 --> 00:44:58.320]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:45:08.814 --> 00:45:10.415]  Welcome to the freeze-dry guy.
[00:45:10.595 --> 00:45:12.937]  Okay, actually, we're more than just one guy.
[00:45:13.017 --> 00:45:15.839]  We're a California-based company that's been serving our U.S.

[00:45:38.701 --> 00:45:40.102]  Just add hot water and serve.
[00:45:40.302 --> 00:45:45.427]  Backpackers consistently rate us number one year after year as the best tasting and ease of preparation.
[00:45:45.647 --> 00:45:47.249]  Isn't that what you want for your family?
[00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:49.270]  Millions of spring breakers are taking their
[00:46:16.613 --> 00:46:19.674]  Saved money from working at the pizza shop in college.
[00:46:20.894 --> 00:46:23.495]  High school graduates and others are flooding to Mexico.
[00:46:23.915 --> 00:46:26.575]  They're not carding down there for all the drunk 18-year-olds.
[00:46:28.656 --> 00:46:33.217]  Spring break, booze, babes, and bodyguards.
[00:46:33.517 --> 00:46:35.278]  Booze, babes, and bodyguards.
[00:46:36.358 --> 00:46:39.358]  And it talks about all the Americans being slaughtered en masse March 15, 2010.
[00:46:41.852 --> 00:46:42.532]  ABC News.
[00:46:42.552 --> 00:46:43.072]  Here's another one.
[00:46:43.112 --> 00:46:44.293]  LA Times in Mexico.
[00:46:44.353 --> 00:46:46.173]  Thirteen killed in Acapulco areas.
[00:46:46.213 --> 00:46:47.613]  Eleven others elsewhere.
[00:46:47.633 --> 00:46:56.615]  And it just talks about all the death and Americans being killed and embassy officials being slaughtered.
[00:46:58.795 --> 00:47:00.156]  It just goes on and on.
[00:47:01.036 --> 00:47:03.316]  Everybody can't wait to race down there and get killed.
[00:47:03.356 --> 00:47:03.676]  Here it is.
[00:47:04.157 --> 00:47:04.817]  Mexico.
[00:47:04.977 --> 00:47:07.077]  Gunmen kill American consulate staff.
[00:47:07.097 --> 00:47:09.778]  This is worse than Guatemala in the seventies and eighties.
[00:47:09.838 --> 00:47:10.758]  But hey, let's
[00:47:11.869 --> 00:47:14.491]  A lot of parents are paying to send their children to Mexico.
[00:47:14.511 --> 00:47:24.559]  I mean, unless you're going somewhere like Ventura is, or in the mountains or something, or where there's nobody, you shouldn't be going to Mexico.
[00:47:24.659 --> 00:47:26.341]  I mean, Mexico is imploding.
[00:47:27.221 --> 00:47:29.863]  Let's continue here with some more of your phone calls, and I'll get into more news.
[00:47:30.524 --> 00:47:31.865]  Let's talk to Scott in Missouri.
[00:47:31.905 --> 00:47:32.746]  Scott, thanks for holding.
[00:47:34.407 --> 00:47:34.587]  Hello?
[00:47:35.108 --> 00:47:35.408]  Yes, sir.
[00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:37.727]  Hello, Alex.
[00:47:37.807 --> 00:47:38.808]  Thanks for keeping everything up.
[00:47:38.868 --> 00:47:40.208]  I've been fighting this for 25 years.
[00:47:40.228 --> 00:47:42.909]  I can't tell you what I've been through, but I'm going to address your audience.
[00:47:43.549 --> 00:47:45.810]  People, get off your butts.
[00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:52.291]  You listen to this program every day, you hear the truth from Alex, and you don't do anything.
[00:47:53.232 --> 00:47:55.352]  Don't talk to your neighbors and drink beer.
[00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:57.413]  You might as well be listening to March Madness.
[00:47:58.653 --> 00:48:00.454]  All my friends talk about this all the time.
[00:48:00.474 --> 00:48:01.914]  I say, hey, let's go hand out flyers.
[00:48:02.194 --> 00:48:03.394]  Let's print DVDs.
[00:48:03.855 --> 00:48:05.255]  Let's have a movie showing.
[00:48:06.189 --> 00:48:07.691]  They're all too busy doing that.
[00:48:08.471 --> 00:48:13.316]  It's great that you know, but you're the sheep that know if you don't go out and do something.
[00:48:14.277 --> 00:48:15.298]  I can't stress that.
[00:48:15.358 --> 00:48:17.160]  I mean, I work on my website five hours a day.
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:21.164]  I've taken off of work permanently to work on this agenda.
[00:48:21.885 --> 00:48:25.909]  And listening isn't anything compared to doing something.
[00:48:28.646 --> 00:48:32.630]  Well, I agree with you, but remember, it's not going to be 50% that saves America.
[00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:34.731]  It's going to be the three percenters, like in 1776.
[00:48:34.791 --> 00:48:40.897]  We've got a lot more than three percent now out there becoming active, and that's what scares the system.
[00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:45.941]  That's why they're trying to demonize anybody and everybody who stands up for liberty and freedom.
[00:48:45.981 --> 00:48:46.842]  God bless you, Scott.
[00:48:46.902 --> 00:48:47.362]  Patrick.
[00:48:47.943 --> 00:48:49.564]  Patrick in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[00:48:50.285 --> 00:48:51.526]  Oh, thank you for taking my call.
[00:48:52.307 --> 00:48:53.368]  Yeah, I have several points.
[00:48:53.428 --> 00:48:54.369]  I'll try to be quick, though.
[00:48:55.143 --> 00:48:58.966]  Everybody in Oklahoma, I just want to encourage you to vote for Randy Brogdon.
[00:48:59.707 --> 00:49:09.796]  If you vote for him and if he wins, encourage him to take down all the real-time surveillance cameras all over Oklahoma City and tell him to stop the sobriety checkpoints every weekend.
[00:49:10.877 --> 00:49:15.000]  The other thing I wanted to address was the property tax issue.
[00:49:15.561 --> 00:49:18.844]  I hear you talk about it, but not very many people talk about it.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:24.526]  If we could get state after state to eliminate property taxes, that's one thing.
[00:49:24.927 --> 00:49:30.353]  Even if you get off the grid and you grow your own food, you're still a slave because you're renting the property.
[00:49:32.642 --> 00:49:39.227]  I heard somebody in, I think it was Deborah Medina, mentioning it, and I was hoping she'd win, but she didn't, and I was hoping that she would.
[00:49:39.267 --> 00:49:47.993]  Maybe our governor would follow her, but if they would eliminate property taxes, then you could grow your own food, and if you didn't work somewhere else, then you wouldn't be paying property taxes.
[00:49:48.013 --> 00:49:51.476]  That's right, and we didn't have property taxes for the last 60, 70 years.
[00:49:52.116 --> 00:49:53.417]  This is a futile tax.
[00:49:53.537 --> 00:49:54.498]  In ancient Europe,
[00:49:56.004 --> 00:49:59.247]  You had to pay about 10% of everything you produced off your land.
[00:49:59.327 --> 00:50:00.187]  You were a serf.
[00:50:00.788 --> 00:50:01.909]  You were not a free man.
[00:50:01.969 --> 00:50:08.915]  A free man actually owned their land outright through some type of signet of the king or the local noble.
[00:50:09.575 --> 00:50:11.677]  And so we don't own our land, we rent.
[00:50:12.137 --> 00:50:12.658]  Our land.
[00:50:13.198 --> 00:50:18.943]  And now with all these environmental rules and the rest of it, they're trying to fully bankrupt people and take whatever sovereignty they've got.
[00:50:19.183 --> 00:50:19.984]  Excellent point.
[00:50:20.404 --> 00:50:22.126]  Get rid of property taxes.
[00:50:22.186 --> 00:50:22.886]  Think big.
[00:50:23.367 --> 00:50:24.648]  We built this country without it.
[00:50:24.908 --> 00:50:25.849]  Without an income tax.
[00:50:25.909 --> 00:50:26.690]  We don't need it.
[00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:28.731]  There's lots of constitutional taxes.
[00:50:30.073 --> 00:50:35.557]  But they're not just expanding the unconstitutional taxes, they're bringing in all these new unconstitutional taxes.
[00:50:35.998 --> 00:50:36.878]  Final hour.
[00:50:36.958 --> 00:50:37.719]  Jam-packed.
[00:50:37.839 --> 00:50:38.460]  Straight ahead.
[00:50:42.173 --> 00:50:45.535]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:47.736]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:49.838 --> 00:50:52.559]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.

[00:51:07.148 --> 00:51:13.275]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[00:51:13.516 --> 00:51:15.498]  That's buy three, get one free.
[00:51:15.678 --> 00:51:18.402]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[00:51:18.582 --> 00:51:26.151]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.

[00:51:53.562 --> 00:51:55.503]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:55.943 --> 00:51:58.864]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:05.146 --> 00:52:06.227]  Okay, here's the deal.
[00:52:06.727 --> 00:52:21.412]  I'm going to Jason and Stacy and a few others and I'm leaving the phones wide open only for veterans who are receiving letters saying they've got to come in for testing or psychological testing or that they'll lose their funding.
[00:52:22.654 --> 00:52:23.634]  Some are getting these letters.
[00:52:23.654 --> 00:52:24.675]  We're getting a lot of reports of this.
[00:52:24.715 --> 00:52:26.115]  Others just say you must come in.
[00:52:26.515 --> 00:52:27.256]  That's bad enough.
[00:52:27.276 --> 00:52:28.016]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:52:28.036 --> 00:52:28.136]  800-259-9231.
[00:52:28.156 --> 00:52:28.936]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:52:28.956 --> 00:52:31.877]  This is the last hour of this Ides of March.
[00:52:31.958 --> 00:52:32.138]  March 15, 2010.
[00:52:32.198 --> 00:52:32.698]  A Dishon.
[00:52:33.118 --> 00:52:35.199]  So thank you for joining us today.
[00:52:35.219 --> 00:52:37.380]  After I take a few more calls, I'm going to get into some very exciting news.
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:38.380]  Idaho
[00:52:53.297 --> 00:52:55.318]  Is reporting out of the Idaho Reporter.
[00:52:56.099 --> 00:52:58.540]  Hurt wants to limit use of whole body scanners.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:52:59.361]  He wants to ban them.
[00:52:59.721 --> 00:53:02.142]  Representative Phil Hurt, Republican of Hayden.
[00:53:02.162 --> 00:53:04.664]  We're going to get him on Idaho Legislature.
[00:53:05.344 --> 00:53:06.084]  And here's the bill.
[00:53:08.426 --> 00:53:12.468]  Also, we're going to get into $650 million payout.
[00:53:12.528 --> 00:53:15.250]  Proves government conspired to lie about 9-11.
[00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:16.450]  Key article.
[00:53:18.031 --> 00:53:18.852]  And then this biggin'.
[00:53:20.171 --> 00:53:20.531]  U.S.
[00:53:20.711 --> 00:53:21.091]  U.K.
[00:53:21.131 --> 00:53:22.752]  move closer to losing rating.
[00:53:22.932 --> 00:53:25.774]  Moody says, we will officially be a third world nation.
[00:53:26.234 --> 00:53:27.534]  All we have left is our dollar.
[00:53:27.654 --> 00:53:28.615]  It's already being devalued.
[00:53:29.175 --> 00:53:35.418]  And because the Federal Reserve is monetizing, buying its own, it pays itself to issue the money and the credit.
[00:53:36.058 --> 00:53:37.899]  It's just like a snake eating its tail.
[00:53:37.919 --> 00:53:39.700]  It's really eating us in the process.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:41.901]  So this is out of Bloomberg.
[00:53:44.361 --> 00:53:45.282]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:46.344]  It's also in Business Week.
[00:53:46.364 --> 00:53:47.465]  You can see that up on your screen.
[00:53:48.146 --> 00:53:50.108]  So that is coming up.
[00:53:50.469 --> 00:53:54.754]  Also, Russian invasion scare sweeps Georgia after TV hoax.
[00:53:55.696 --> 00:53:57.618]  Well, the thing on 888 was a hoax.
[00:53:58.099 --> 00:54:00.482]  So we're going to talk about that.
[00:54:03.137 --> 00:54:04.838]  Coming up as well.
[00:54:05.358 --> 00:54:11.841]  And I want to get back into the fluoride situation that I started covering yesterday before this hour in.
[00:54:11.961 --> 00:54:15.483]  So a key fourth hour that you're tuned into right now.
[00:54:16.403 --> 00:54:18.604]  But let's go ahead now and go to Jason in Florida.
[00:54:18.664 --> 00:54:19.565]  Jason, you're on the air.
[00:54:20.425 --> 00:54:20.945]  Hey, Alex.
[00:54:21.746 --> 00:54:21.986]  Hello.
[00:54:22.086 --> 00:54:25.587]  And I just want to say that I really admire you.
[00:54:27.108 --> 00:54:28.909]  Your last guest that you had on.
[00:54:30.134 --> 00:54:33.737]  She, I assume, is like you, has so much common sense.
[00:54:33.877 --> 00:54:35.718]  I wish people had common sense.
[00:54:36.619 --> 00:54:37.860]  You know, just use your head.
[00:54:39.161 --> 00:54:42.183]  You could figure stuff out so easily just by using your head.
[00:54:44.245 --> 00:54:45.906]  Oh, but that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:54:45.926 --> 00:54:55.273]  If you don't like banks raping you, or you don't like body scanning cameras run by people arrested for child rape, Boston Herald today, you must be bad.
[00:54:56.374 --> 00:54:59.396]  Oh, and I want to say, I thank you so much for earlier
[00:54:59.989 --> 00:55:09.631]  Repeating what John Walsh said about the pedophiles and people that are registered because Here in Florida, I live where Cargill is.
[00:55:10.071 --> 00:55:21.474]  Just north, I live in Lakeland, Florida, north of Mulberry, where the pits are, the mines, that Austin buys all their crap to put in the water.
[00:55:22.714 --> 00:55:27.895]  And, um, yeah, in the Sheriff's Department here, you might have seen us on the
[00:55:28.877 --> 00:55:43.066]  Mainstream media, when these guys went to raid some guy's home looking for drugs, and spent nine hours playing Wii on his TV, and they were busted because the computer recorded them all doing it.
[00:55:43.566 --> 00:55:44.126]  Remember that?
[00:55:44.987 --> 00:55:46.188]  No, I didn't hear about that.
[00:55:47.068 --> 00:55:47.689]  Oh yeah?
[00:55:47.729 --> 00:55:48.829]  What was the headline on that?
[00:55:48.929 --> 00:55:51.291]  Police caught playing Wii in suspect's home?
[00:55:52.151 --> 00:55:52.372]  Yep.
[00:55:53.252 --> 00:55:54.153]  Pull that up.
[00:55:54.673 --> 00:55:56.154]  Nine hours they did this.
[00:55:56.661 --> 00:56:01.948]  And all the cops got for it was just a, you know, oh, you need to go and have training done again.
[00:56:01.968 --> 00:56:04.552]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:56:04.612 --> 00:56:08.518]  Florida police caught playing Wii after raid for nine hours.
[00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:11.942]  I mean, what a bunch of lazy thugs, man.
[00:56:12.978 --> 00:56:13.858]  Oh, it makes me sick.
[00:56:13.938 --> 00:56:14.918]  I appreciate your call.
[00:56:15.279 --> 00:56:19.660]  By the way, I mentioned this yesterday, but Jaren just brought it in again, because it is a big deal.
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:20.640]  Thanks for reminding me.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:22.560]  AP exclusive!
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:28.422]  Pentagon gun was from Tennessee police, and Kurt Nimmo wrote a blurb on this.
[00:56:28.962 --> 00:56:31.642]  So was the gun used in the courthouse killing.
[00:56:32.143 --> 00:56:32.443]  Shooting.
[00:56:33.483 --> 00:56:36.363]  The police confiscate your guns and then give them to the killers.
[00:56:36.884 --> 00:56:38.244]  Definitely a stage government op.
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:43.282]  And I like Peter Graves.
[00:56:43.322 --> 00:56:44.324]  He died yesterday.
[00:56:44.344 --> 00:56:45.345]  A couple days ago.
[00:56:45.365 --> 00:56:46.186]  Too bad that happened.
[00:56:46.206 --> 00:56:46.687]  I like him.
[00:56:48.108 --> 00:56:53.095]  Mission Impossible.
[00:56:54.256 --> 00:56:56.679]  This is not Mission Impossible to defeat the New World Order.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.201]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:58.221 --> 00:56:58.662]  Stay with us.

[00:58:08.521 --> 00:58:09.101]  Number two.
[00:58:09.381 --> 00:58:13.924]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:58:14.284 --> 00:58:14.724]  It's true.
[00:58:15.024 --> 00:58:19.567]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:58:19.887 --> 00:58:20.428]  Number 3.
[00:58:20.708 --> 00:58:23.992]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:58:24.293 --> 00:58:28.037]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:58:28.217 --> 00:58:28.758]  Number 4.
[00:58:29.018 --> 00:58:31.401]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:58:31.782 --> 00:58:35.166]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:35.466 --> 00:58:35.667]  Number 5.
[00:58:36.227 --> 00:58:40.151]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:58:40.371 --> 00:58:45.156]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:58:45.436 --> 00:58:49.460]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:51.181]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:51.402 --> 00:58:56.006]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:01.075 --> 00:59:03.803]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[00:59:04.104 --> 00:59:06.832]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jump start.
[00:59:08.746 --> 00:59:09.786]  We're good to go.
[00:59:37.791 --> 00:59:40.674]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[00:59:41.054 --> 00:59:41.894]  Another example?
[00:59:42.035 --> 00:59:45.097]  Buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[00:59:45.217 --> 00:59:50.361]  You've got to go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[00:59:50.381 --> 00:59:51.042]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[00:59:51.102 --> 00:59:52.163]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.806]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:04.408 --> 01:00:07.196]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:21.859]  Okay, now the phones are only open for veterans that are receiving these letters saying they've got to show up for psychological or other evaluation or they'll lose their funding, which cannot be revoked by law.
[01:00:21.879 --> 01:00:25.181]  You know, Obama last year, we had to have the Veterans of Foreign Wars on.
[01:00:25.202 --> 01:00:26.422]  It was in Reuters.
[01:00:27.103 --> 01:00:29.265]  Obama wanted to make veterans buy their own insurance.
[01:00:30.025 --> 01:00:33.247]  Yeah, let's give all the illegal aliens health care, but not veterans.
[01:00:33.328 --> 01:00:33.968]  I mean, you know.
[01:00:34.594 --> 01:00:38.176]  And the bigger issue here is police and current veterans.
[01:00:38.816 --> 01:00:40.276]  You will be thrown under the bus.
[01:00:40.356 --> 01:00:41.477]  The globalists hate you.
[01:00:41.537 --> 01:00:42.737]  You know how to use a gun.
[01:00:43.138 --> 01:00:44.638]  You know how to carry out authority.
[01:00:44.878 --> 01:00:46.099]  You've been taught initiative.
[01:00:46.339 --> 01:00:47.739]  You've been taught assertiveness.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:52.121]  You have built up not just courage, there's something even better than courage.
[01:00:52.541 --> 01:00:53.642]  You just get to where you don't care.
[01:00:54.781 --> 01:01:02.968]  I'm not claiming I'm a veteran, I've never been in the military, but I've had death threats, I've been physically attacked, I've been through a lot of stress, and you just get to a point where you really don't even care.
[01:01:03.008 --> 01:01:05.910]  In fact, you actually lose energy until you're being attacked.
[01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:15.258]  I'm sure a lot of people that have been under stress know this, and I have nothing compared to these veterans and police who've got really tough jobs, and a lot of great men and women.
[01:01:17.878 --> 01:01:18.999]  They're scared to death of you.
[01:01:19.319 --> 01:01:24.523]  Cops, when you're done, and when you've spent your 30 years on the force, they're going to come after you too.
[01:01:25.104 --> 01:01:25.784]  They already are.
[01:01:26.345 --> 01:01:28.706]  And you need to figure this out and get it through your brain.
[01:01:28.746 --> 01:01:30.448]  You're with us, the American people.
[01:01:30.488 --> 01:01:31.088]  Jaren, come on in.
[01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.269]  Thanks.
[01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:33.290]  More documents.
[01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:35.332]  Okay.
[01:01:36.372 --> 01:01:38.474]  Stacey was before the veterans started calling.
[01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:39.935]  We're going to Pastor and others.
[01:01:39.975 --> 01:01:41.376]  The caller's going by.
[01:01:42.237 --> 01:01:43.238]  Stacey in Washington.
[01:01:43.278 --> 01:01:43.638]  Go ahead.
[01:01:44.739 --> 01:01:45.339]  Hey, Alex.
[01:01:45.379 --> 01:01:45.920]  How you doing?
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:53.126]  Hey, I'm just letting you know I joined the Info Warrior Mass with you.
[01:01:53.166 --> 01:01:55.569]  I got you broadcasting here in Spokane, Washington.
[01:01:56.751 --> 01:01:57.752]  But that's not my question.
[01:01:57.772 --> 01:02:06.304]  My question was, what do you know about Eastern Washington State University's involvement in the Global Geoengineering Project here?
[01:02:07.054 --> 01:02:08.034]  I know quite a bit about it.
[01:02:08.075 --> 01:02:12.196]  We've gone out and interviewed Skywatch, California, the founders of it.
[01:02:12.477 --> 01:02:14.738]  They've been to all these government meetings, all these documents.
[01:02:14.758 --> 01:02:15.778]  We are Change LA.
[01:02:16.198 --> 01:02:20.540]  Went to one of the meetings, and about four years ago, a caller called in.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.661]  Again, I don't know everything.
[01:02:21.841 --> 01:02:22.901]  There's a lot I don't know.
[01:02:23.402 --> 01:02:27.403]  I'm just somebody that focuses on this all the time, and so I know more than most.
[01:02:27.463 --> 01:02:30.805]  I mean, if you did it as much as I did, most of you would be better at this than I am.
[01:02:31.365 --> 01:02:34.527]  And the caller called in, and what was the term he used?
[01:02:37.864 --> 01:02:40.649]  Call Watson, ask him the aerosol campaign name.
[01:02:40.749 --> 01:02:43.394]  Watson, the brain, will always know these things.
[01:02:43.434 --> 01:02:45.998]  I'm kind of tired, only got 3-4 hours sleep last night.
[01:02:46.479 --> 01:02:47.701]  The caller called in and he said...
[01:02:48.922 --> 01:02:57.511]  Passive aerosol spray campaign, I believe is the term, and literally hundreds of thousands of links, mainly universities and government.
[01:02:57.811 --> 01:02:59.032]  They call it testing.
[01:02:59.933 --> 01:03:08.361]  And thousands of aircraft missions, they mention, where they're spraying particulates out that then form nuclei that form clouds.
[01:03:09.278 --> 01:03:11.019]  Well, they spray nuclei out that form clouds.
[01:03:11.699 --> 01:03:19.863]  And then White House Science Czar came out last year in his first speech, it's AP video, and said, we need to terraform, geoengineer the planet.
[01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:23.424]  And that university you mentioned is one of the main ones, Stanford's involved.
[01:03:23.904 --> 01:03:26.405]  I mean, literally, Department of Energy, other governments.
[01:03:27.346 --> 01:03:31.608]  And I was out back with the kids playing football this weekend.
[01:03:32.548 --> 01:03:36.690]  And I sat back in a lawn chair with my wife, we're drinking lemonade.
[01:03:37.645 --> 01:03:43.608]  And I looked up at like 35,000 feet and saw jets going over and the trails were disappearing within 30 seconds.
[01:03:44.189 --> 01:03:47.971]  And I was like, wow, a good old-fashioned condensation trail.
[01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:51.132]  Remember when you were a kid, it was kind of neat to see them because you didn't see them that often.
[01:03:52.033 --> 01:03:57.796]  And at sunset you'd see them and you'd see these orange streaks in the night sky up where the sunlight was still coming over the earth.
[01:03:58.823 --> 01:04:09.212]  And sometimes, depending on the tilt of the earth, it can even be dark outside, but still up at, say, 50,000 feet, the sun's light was coming over and you'd see these beautiful condensation trails.
[01:04:09.292 --> 01:04:12.175]  Now, starting at about 96, trails at 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 feet in the summer.
[01:04:16.098 --> 01:04:19.399]  When at 5,000 feet, you know, it's 80 degrees, 75 degrees.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.040]  There's no ice crystals up there.
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.761]  And it stays there for an hour.
[01:04:22.821 --> 01:04:23.601]  It dissipates.
[01:04:23.701 --> 01:04:27.123]  I mean, does it dissipate and then turns into these big cloud banks?
[01:04:27.783 --> 01:04:29.104]  And then we get the government documents.
[01:04:30.664 --> 01:04:31.485]  Forget the scientist's name.
[01:04:31.505 --> 01:04:35.326]  He got a Nobel Prize in 92 for the geoengineering plan.
[01:04:35.847 --> 01:04:37.788]  How to put the particulates out from jets.
[01:04:39.668 --> 01:04:42.650]  How to compartmentalize it where the jet pilots don't even know it's going on.
[01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:45.451]  And how to manipulate the weather.
[01:04:46.659 --> 01:04:57.170]  And so they just, and it turns out that in 95 is when the major testing, you know they call it testing, and now Obama says we're going to go full bore with this.
[01:04:57.230 --> 01:05:00.393]  I can't imagine what full bore, in fact put that article back up please.
[01:05:00.413 --> 01:05:01.294]  You just found a great article.
[01:05:01.654 --> 01:05:03.196]  That's the Infowars.net article.
[01:05:03.876 --> 01:05:07.980]  Obama's plan to geoengineer the planet mirrors CFR policy documents.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:08.941]  Yeah, the CFR!
[01:05:10.003 --> 01:05:11.564]  In the 90s said Geoengineer.
[01:05:11.584 --> 01:05:12.404]  They had another one in May of 2008.
[01:05:12.804 --> 01:05:14.945]  And don't believe Infowars.net.
[01:05:15.585 --> 01:05:17.565]  Second paragraph, link to the AP.
[01:05:18.466 --> 01:05:19.366]  Fourth paragraph.
[01:05:20.226 --> 01:05:21.247]  No, fifth paragraph.
[01:05:21.807 --> 01:05:23.227]  Link to the CFR.
[01:05:23.247 --> 01:05:25.008]  In fact, let's on screen for people.
[01:05:25.468 --> 01:05:27.449]  Let's click the CFR document.
[01:05:27.469 --> 01:05:30.590]  Let's go to the CFR that basically writes our laws.
[01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:34.311]  And let's click on this live on TV for people.
[01:05:35.152 --> 01:05:36.393]  Oh, see, here's Chemtrails.
[01:05:37.034 --> 01:05:38.516]  Loading, loading, loading.
[01:05:39.316 --> 01:05:42.179]  And, uh, CFR site's loading.
[01:05:42.199 --> 01:05:43.360]  There it is!
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:43.420]  Oh!
[01:05:43.881 --> 01:05:51.188]  Council on Foreign Relations Geoengineering Workshop on Unilateral Planetary Scale Geoengineering.
[01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:51.248]  Oh!
[01:05:51.588 --> 01:05:53.110]  But I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[01:05:55.757 --> 01:05:58.480]  I mean, what are we doing here?
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.021]  Why are we putting up with this?
[01:06:00.081 --> 01:06:07.428]  I mean, these people are playing God, and they admit they're doing it in policy papers, but then when you talk about it, they go, shut up, lunatic!
[01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:10.310]  Stacy, I appreciate you.
[01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:11.551]  Anything else about your university?
[01:06:12.932 --> 01:06:13.973]  No, that's just it's home.
[01:06:14.033 --> 01:06:18.818]  It's right down the road from us here in Spokane, so I thought I'd let some people around my area know about that.
[01:06:19.793 --> 01:06:20.773]  Well, thank you, Stacey.
[01:06:20.813 --> 01:06:21.573]  Don't feel bad.
[01:06:21.673 --> 01:06:30.075]  Every major university, randomly look up the name of your university, if it's a major school, not just a community college, and type in geoengineering.
[01:06:31.175 --> 01:06:32.876]  Did Watson say that key search term?
[01:06:33.376 --> 01:06:37.337]  Something about aerosols, passive aerosol spraying campaign?
[01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:38.377]  I think that's the term.
[01:06:38.397 --> 01:06:40.117]  But I don't want to give it out wrong.
[01:06:40.477 --> 01:06:40.978]  Passive?
[01:06:41.258 --> 01:06:42.118]  What's the key?
[01:06:42.998 --> 01:06:45.399]  The caller, four years ago, that changed everything.
[01:06:47.119 --> 01:06:47.359]  Again.
[01:06:48.749 --> 01:06:54.580]  This had been hidden in view for 10 years on the internet, totally admitted, and I didn't know it was admitted.
[01:06:57.926 --> 01:06:58.427]  Until you...
[01:06:59.858 --> 01:07:00.938]  Figured it out and called me.
[01:07:01.679 --> 01:07:05.541]  And then we put it out to this big audience, and now, why should they hide it?
[01:07:05.581 --> 01:07:07.782]  They just come out and go, yeah, we're chemtrailing you.
[01:07:08.322 --> 01:07:10.403]  Barium salts, aluminum dioxide.
[01:07:10.763 --> 01:07:11.883]  Massive brain damage.
[01:07:12.164 --> 01:07:16.085]  Oh, you won't drink your fluoride, also filled with mercury and aluminum.
[01:07:16.445 --> 01:07:18.887]  Oh, oh, well, we're just gonna spray it on you.
[01:07:20.687 --> 01:07:24.609]  I mean, how stupid, why aren't all the cops on our side right now?
[01:07:24.889 --> 01:07:26.290]  You're being sprayed too, buddy!
[01:07:29.395 --> 01:07:31.578]  I don't want to be enemies with the government people.
[01:07:32.178 --> 01:07:40.628]  Because I know they're just like me, they're just like you, they're just people, they're compartmentalized, they're brainwashed, they're dumbed down just like I was 14, 15 years ago.
[01:07:43.191 --> 01:07:45.714]  I'm ranting and I said I've got so much news to get to.
[01:07:45.734 --> 01:07:48.137]  Alright, we've got a couple vets that have called in.
[01:07:48.217 --> 01:07:50.119]  Pastor in Ohio, did you get the letter?
[01:07:51.175 --> 01:08:00.963]  Yeah, I got a... Alex, I called you before and I got this letter from the VA and what it did was is they literally changed my scheduled appointment.
[01:08:01.984 --> 01:08:14.234]  And when I got in there, they went ahead and did a regular scheduled appointment, but then I was talking to the... After I got through, they wanted me to come down to see the DAV.
[01:08:14.254 --> 01:08:17.417]  I asked what for and they said, well, they just wanted to talk with me.
[01:08:17.857 --> 01:08:18.918]  Well, when I went there,
[01:08:19.964 --> 01:08:29.286]  I went in there and they said they just had a few questions to ask if I had bad dreams or if I got emotional watching movies and things like that.
[01:08:30.066 --> 01:08:35.107]  I started asking all these questions and asked if I ever had a psych exam and I said no.
[01:08:35.908 --> 01:08:40.189]  Well, the phone rang and they asked me if I could step out of the office because this was an important call.
[01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:45.230]  Well, I called my wife on my cell phone to let her know what was going on.
[01:08:47.412 --> 01:08:51.554]  She just got off the phone with them.
[01:08:51.574 --> 01:08:59.337]  Here they called my house and was asking my wife the exact same questions that they were asking me.
[01:09:00.297 --> 01:09:05.479]  Yeah, well that's because you're the pastor that gave us some of the FEMA documents and you're being targeted.
[01:09:05.639 --> 01:09:07.060]  But let's expand on this.
[01:09:08.761 --> 01:09:16.304]  All three times I went in to have children with my wife at the hospital, we figured it out the first time, they said, will you run this file downstairs for me?
[01:09:17.722 --> 01:09:18.203]  I leave.
[01:09:18.223 --> 01:09:20.428]  I come back five minutes later.
[01:09:21.505 --> 01:09:25.407]  And my wife says, that lady was asking me, first, do we have enough money?
[01:09:25.788 --> 01:09:26.728]  Am I mean to you?
[01:09:28.109 --> 01:09:31.311]  I think they asked her the same thing, do you have bad dreams?
[01:09:31.871 --> 01:09:36.614]  And then later I figured it out and confronted them by the second time, and it's for the CPS.
[01:09:37.294 --> 01:09:38.775]  They don't tell you they're basically a cop.
[01:09:38.835 --> 01:09:40.256]  They don't tell you you're being interrogated.
[01:09:40.296 --> 01:09:41.417]  There's no Miranda rights.
[01:09:41.817 --> 01:09:42.697]  It's totally illegal.
[01:09:42.917 --> 01:09:47.020]  But the health department orders the hospital to do this via color of law.
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:48.521]  And it's put in a computer database.
[01:09:50.117 --> 01:09:52.839]  Going back to the New Freedom Initiative, the internal documents came out in 2005.
[01:09:52.879 --> 01:09:55.981]  This was in the major Pennsylvania papers.
[01:09:56.041 --> 01:09:57.922]  That's where one of their board members blew the whistle.
[01:09:59.083 --> 01:10:06.587]  The internal minutes that they plan to put half of American school children on psychotropics and anti-psychotics, Prozac, lithium, things like that.
[01:10:07.208 --> 01:10:16.253]  And how they did it is that they've written the New Freedom where all boys and girls in elementary and middle school, and then high school, and 13, 14 year olds always are having problems.
[01:10:16.273 --> 01:10:18.855]  Your hormones, you're changing, you're having, you know, it's normal.
[01:10:19.875 --> 01:10:27.641]  This is the time in anthropology and sociology and psychology for you to leave the home in the primitive situation and go start your own hut at about 13, 14, 15.
[01:10:30.003 --> 01:10:33.525]  So there's a natural thing to get the kids out of the house so you start fighting with each other.
[01:10:33.985 --> 01:10:37.888]  But the point is, they say, are you having bad dreams?
[01:10:38.049 --> 01:10:39.169]  Everyone has bad dreams.
[01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:41.311]  I mean, I usually have good dreams.
[01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:43.392]  I had one hell of a nightmare about a week ago.
[01:10:46.795 --> 01:10:49.037]  But see, that's mentally ill.
[01:10:50.256 --> 01:10:51.816]  I mean, that's bad!
[01:10:52.697 --> 01:11:05.260]  So, they call you in, they ask you if you're having bad dreams, psychological problems, they want to take your Second Amendment with no law, then they say, we need to make a phone call, they call your wife, you have a bad feeling and call her, and they say, they just called me, what else happened?
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:18.204]  Well, she told me all the questions that they asked her, and which was some of the ones that they even asked me, and my wife said, well, my husband's up there, why don't you just ask him?
[01:11:24.928 --> 01:11:27.229]  The government lies as a matter of course.
[01:11:27.289 --> 01:11:28.410]  It's a criminal group.
[01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:29.430]  So how did this end?
[01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:30.571]  Did you march in and confront them?
[01:11:31.271 --> 01:11:38.235]  Oh, and I bet getting angry at their lies and secret police activity, treating a veteran like a criminal,
[01:11:39.565 --> 01:11:42.786]  And creating definitions of mental illness so wide we're all mentally ill.
[01:11:43.306 --> 01:11:45.127]  I bet that was the mental illness, too.
[01:11:45.207 --> 01:11:47.207]  Oh, you got angry at us snooping around and lying.
[01:11:47.667 --> 01:11:48.587]  Stay there, Pastor.
[01:11:48.848 --> 01:11:53.089]  Then we're going to go to Rob, Bob, Raul, and others.
[01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:56.430]  And then that's going to be it with the vets because I need to get to all this news.
[01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:57.470]  Believe me, it's jam-packed.
[01:11:57.710 --> 01:11:58.490]  It's all coming up.
[01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:00.151]  Saving the most important for last.
[01:12:03.211 --> 01:12:08.853]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.

[01:12:11.731 --> 01:12:13.192]  Are you fully prepared?
[01:12:13.972 --> 01:12:16.672]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?

[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:48.403]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[01:12:48.703 --> 01:12:51.064]  Food insurance, just in case.
[01:12:51.645 --> 01:12:56.248]  Owned by me, Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[01:13:00.256 --> 01:13:03.418]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:13:03.778 --> 01:13:05.619]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:13:06.079 --> 01:13:06.499]  Don't!
[01:13:06.939 --> 01:13:09.961]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[01:13:51.866 --> 01:13:54.006]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:13:54.026 --> 01:13:56.287]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:14:10.586 --> 01:14:13.248]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:14:13.268 --> 01:14:19.452]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:14:19.632 --> 01:14:24.656]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:14:24.836 --> 01:14:34.842]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:14:34.943 --> 01:14:37.064]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:14:37.304 --> 01:14:38.625]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:14:38.885 --> 01:14:39.766]  And the Congress is saying,
[01:14:40.126 --> 01:14:41.127]  Who do I make the check out to?
[01:14:41.327 --> 01:14:43.168]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:14:43.448 --> 01:14:48.270]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:16:09.044 --> 01:16:10.784]  We just got more documents in.
[01:16:11.184 --> 01:16:14.205]  Material safety data sheet, calcium fluoride.
[01:16:14.605 --> 01:16:16.506]  That's supposedly the good kind they put in water.
[01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:19.146]  How dangerous and deadly it is.
[01:16:19.906 --> 01:16:21.147]  Make your organs fail.
[01:16:21.727 --> 01:16:24.327]  This is just the safety shipping info for it.
[01:16:26.768 --> 01:16:29.949]  Alright, going back to Pastor in Ohio, and I can vouch for Pastor.
[01:16:32.811 --> 01:16:39.315]  Well, they denied that it even happened and she stated that it wasn't even her that made the call and so I have some people that I know that are higher up that I went to at the VA office
[01:16:55.584 --> 01:17:06.592]  And I come to find out that the big push for all this is they're trying to get as many Vietnam vets classified to where they can have their psych exams.
[01:17:06.612 --> 01:17:13.457]  Because once you have a psych exam, you not only cannot buy a gun, but you cannot get a concealed carry license.
[01:17:14.118 --> 01:17:20.042]  And also, it was stated that the big reason for this whole push is because
[01:17:20.782 --> 01:17:30.467]  The Vietnam veterans were the last veterans that could actually do everything that the veterans are doing today as far as forward observers and all the other stuff.
[01:17:31.068 --> 01:17:38.031]  We could actually do it without having something that used a battery in order to come up with the calculations.
[01:17:38.952 --> 01:17:46.156]  And they know that the Vietnam vets could actually train one Vietnam vet, they said, if he trained ten persons.
[01:17:46.916 --> 01:17:47.997]  That is a lot of
[01:17:48.604 --> 01:17:53.026]  People learning a lot of information that they would not have otherwise found out.
[01:17:53.066 --> 01:17:59.130]  But they're using the DAV and the VFW to get the names of people, also.
[01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:00.250]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:06.373]  You saw the New York Times, it's in Fall of the Republic, how they're training the Boy Scouts to quote, take on disgruntled vets.
[01:18:07.034 --> 01:18:09.195]  I mean, you can't make up this magnitude of evil.
[01:18:10.157 --> 01:18:11.117]  And it's so illegal.
[01:18:11.898 --> 01:18:17.060]  There's no law that they just make up a psychological designation, you can't have a gun, but they control the instant check.
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:20.341]  By the way, we told you Arte Cerveza is probably going to go to Dallas.
[01:18:20.701 --> 01:18:25.563]  The Austin police chief, who's basically a fed, who started warrantless blood taking.
[01:18:26.163 --> 01:18:29.824]  Now, here is the Dallas Morning News today.
[01:18:30.545 --> 01:18:34.506]  Dallas police seek blood tests for all DUI suspects.
[01:18:35.006 --> 01:18:37.167]  No judge, no jury, no warrant.
[01:18:37.607 --> 01:18:39.028]  Everyone will have their blood taken.
[01:18:39.878 --> 01:18:42.740]  You won't be marched out to see if you can stand on one leg.
[01:18:43.321 --> 01:18:45.622]  You won't have to sit there and follow the light and touch your nose.
[01:18:45.662 --> 01:18:46.483]  I've had them do it to me.
[01:18:47.444 --> 01:18:48.644]  I'm like, no, I'm not drinking.
[01:18:48.684 --> 01:18:50.386]  No, I really was working at 2 o'clock in the morning.
[01:18:51.447 --> 01:18:52.247]  Get out of the car.
[01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:55.910]  And I could have refused it, but I said, this guy's going to arrest me if I refuse.
[01:18:56.670 --> 01:18:58.111]  I did it, and I did it all perfectly.
[01:18:58.151 --> 01:18:58.712]  I said, see?
[01:18:59.072 --> 01:19:01.574]  And he goes, are you on PCP, cocaine, or other drugs?
[01:19:01.594 --> 01:19:02.775]  And I said, PCP?
[01:19:03.435 --> 01:19:06.377]  Number one, I don't do drugs, and I know no one who's ever seen PCP.
[01:19:06.698 --> 01:19:08.059]  And he started laughing along with me.
[01:19:10.962 --> 01:19:12.842]  Some of us do work till two o'clock in the morning.
[01:19:12.862 --> 01:19:14.223]  We don't need to just be pulled over.
[01:19:14.703 --> 01:19:18.764]  I was driving completely straight, going home, side issue.
[01:19:20.504 --> 01:19:23.425]  Now they're going to take your blood to get a driver's license.
[01:19:23.445 --> 01:19:25.145]  That's already on the books as an executive order.
[01:19:27.306 --> 01:19:29.386]  Raul in Florida, a vet, then Bob.
[01:19:29.846 --> 01:19:31.106]  Did this happen to you, Raul?
[01:19:31.787 --> 01:19:32.647]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:19:33.007 --> 01:19:33.287]  Good, sir.
[01:19:35.051 --> 01:19:38.113]  I heard the caller calling about the letter to the veterans.
[01:19:38.593 --> 01:19:42.495]  Well, they're also doing it without notifying veterans, because I was one of those.
[01:19:42.575 --> 01:19:52.282]  I'm already getting service-connected for PTSD, and on a visit with my psychiatrist, they said, oh, you're scheduled for another competent for PTSD.
[01:19:53.002 --> 01:19:53.682]  And I said, really?
[01:19:53.722 --> 01:19:55.824]  She was like, well, that's really supposed to go through me.
[01:19:56.587 --> 01:19:58.068]  And she goes, they just scheduled you for it.
[01:19:58.608 --> 01:20:03.411]  And now notice they've started all these PSAs about our veterans are having problems.
[01:20:03.671 --> 01:20:06.653]  See, they're starting the demonization of the veterans in PSAs.
[01:20:07.914 --> 01:20:08.334]  Exactly.
[01:20:08.675 --> 01:20:23.324]  And then in Florida, I know there's another letter circulating on that they have, um, the letter I received was, um, notified me personally, identifiable information, including your name and social security number were improperly disclosed.
[01:20:24.648 --> 01:20:33.989]  And on the letterhead is the Department of Veterans Affairs and it has a promotion code to go to Equifax and get their credit monitoring for free.
[01:20:35.592 --> 01:20:37.793]  I was wondering what do you think?
[01:20:37.853 --> 01:20:39.755]  Yeah, they want to track everything you're buying.
[01:20:39.815 --> 01:20:42.176]  That's what all this identity theft protection is.
[01:20:42.216 --> 01:20:45.918]  Meanwhile, the banks, 600,000 names, a million names, five million names.
[01:20:46.238 --> 01:20:47.839]  Every week, I saw one yesterday.
[01:20:47.859 --> 01:20:49.660]  In fact, where is that article?
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:53.623]  600,000 social security numbers given out by a major bank.
[01:20:54.603 --> 01:20:55.964]  That's where it's all happening.
[01:20:56.224 --> 01:21:00.447]  And it's happening at gas stations where they scan your card and then they
[01:21:01.247 --> 01:21:04.530]  Fax the number to their brother in India or Russia, mainly.
[01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:08.033]  In Pakistan it happens a lot, and that's where they're ripping you off.
[01:21:08.354 --> 01:21:12.838]  But the media won't tell you how the real rip-offs are happening.
[01:21:12.858 --> 01:21:15.060]  They tell you, oh, you need to have fraud monitoring.
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:19.724]  Citibank exposes 600,000 customers' social security numbers.
[01:21:19.744 --> 01:21:21.085]  There it is, Chicago Tribune, Friday.
[01:21:22.106 --> 01:21:23.468]  So how did this end, Darul?
[01:21:24.552 --> 01:21:32.756]  Well, I ended up going to the appointment and he basically just talked in anecdotal stories and it was basically a waste of time.
[01:21:33.276 --> 01:21:34.637]  And you know, you get the basic questions.
[01:21:34.757 --> 01:21:35.697]  Are you going to kill anybody?
[01:21:35.777 --> 01:21:36.718]  Are you going to hurt yourself?
[01:21:37.978 --> 01:21:39.839]  And it was a basic waste of time.
[01:21:39.879 --> 01:21:43.801]  And then he put a whole bunch of stuff in his computer that I couldn't see and then I was done.
[01:21:43.841 --> 01:21:45.602]  But he typed longer than he talked to me.
[01:21:46.622 --> 01:21:48.143]  And see, he's the new judge.
[01:21:48.243 --> 01:21:49.784]  He decides if you can own a gun.
[01:21:49.804 --> 01:21:51.085]  Because you're an evil veteran.
[01:21:51.105 --> 01:21:51.885]  We're on the march.
[01:21:52.385 --> 01:21:53.886]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.901 --> 01:21:57.684]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:59.987 --> 01:22:00.968]  What's your home worth?
[01:22:01.128 --> 01:22:03.070]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:05.993]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[01:23:01.816 --> 01:23:05.497]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:23:05.857 --> 01:23:08.858]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:23:09.098 --> 01:23:10.519]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:23:11.218 --> 01:23:13.859]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:23:13.879 --> 01:23:20.102]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:23:20.282 --> 01:23:25.284]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:23:25.825 --> 01:23:28.626]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:23:28.746 --> 01:23:35.449]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:23:35.569 --> 01:23:37.691]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:23:37.911 --> 01:23:39.252]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:23:39.512 --> 01:23:41.794]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:23:41.974 --> 01:23:43.816]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:23:44.096 --> 01:23:48.920]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:58.367]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:25:33.323 --> 01:25:35.825]  Okay, I'm going to take one more call from a vet.
[01:25:35.965 --> 01:25:40.970]  And if you just joined us, Clinton started this covertly.
[01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:44.393]  They're now openly saying, no judge, no jury, no law.
[01:25:45.034 --> 01:25:54.442]  They just have VA hospital psychologists, psychiatrists, and other employees just say you're mentally ill.
[01:25:54.622 --> 01:25:58.545]  If you go in and say, I have nightmares sometimes, that's it.
[01:25:58.566 --> 01:25:59.687]  No more Second Amendment for you.
[01:26:00.711 --> 01:26:01.652]  And they don't even tell you that.
[01:26:01.692 --> 01:26:03.713]  They just put it in the computer, and it's done.
[01:26:04.253 --> 01:26:07.215]  When you go in to have a baby, they say, do you have plenty of money?
[01:26:07.235 --> 01:26:08.596]  Do you guys argue and fight?
[01:26:09.017 --> 01:26:10.298]  They'll get the man out of the room.
[01:26:10.698 --> 01:26:11.999]  It all goes to the health department.
[01:26:12.299 --> 01:26:17.462]  You're not being told that you're basically in a law enforcement setting, outside of any law.
[01:26:17.623 --> 01:26:19.424]  This is the essence of a police state.
[01:26:20.731 --> 01:26:23.674]  And they hate veteran police, they hate veteran military.
[01:26:24.355 --> 01:26:26.016]  Why do you serve this new world order?
[01:26:26.036 --> 01:26:26.857]  Why do you love it?
[01:26:26.877 --> 01:26:29.079]  Why do you go along with the petty power you're given?
[01:26:29.359 --> 01:26:33.604]  Because after you're not their servant anymore, you are their number one target.
[01:26:33.944 --> 01:26:36.386]  And it was the same in Nazi Germany and Communist Russia.
[01:26:36.727 --> 01:26:40.610]  They always go after the retirees who've worked in the system.
[01:26:40.911 --> 01:26:45.115]  And as the police state gets worse, that's correspondingly going to get worse.
[01:26:47.139 --> 01:26:48.440]  America is a police state.
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:50.280]  I mean, look at these headlines I've got right here.
[01:26:50.661 --> 01:26:53.522]  Dallas police seek blood tests for all DUI suspects.
[01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:56.463]  See, first, they started in Austin taking blood without warrants.
[01:26:56.783 --> 01:27:01.406]  Well, it was a rubber stamp warrant where the judge would say, test whoever you want.
[01:27:02.666 --> 01:27:03.607]  Lawsuits were filed.
[01:27:04.127 --> 01:27:04.327]  R.J.
[01:27:04.347 --> 01:27:09.189]  Cerveda, federal guy, federal police chief, that's what he really is, was brought in out of California.
[01:27:10.150 --> 01:27:11.010]  He beta tested it.
[01:27:11.050 --> 01:27:13.031]  Now he's set to be the Dallas police chief.
[01:27:15.336 --> 01:27:16.276]  And I said that last week.
[01:27:16.296 --> 01:27:18.618]  I said he'll be up there with warrantless blood draws there.
[01:27:18.998 --> 01:27:23.400]  Now they just say everybody suspected will have blood taken without a warrant.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:26.982]  Dallas police seek blood tests for all DUI suspects.
[01:27:27.662 --> 01:27:30.863]  And there's nothing in here about the Constitution or anything.
[01:27:32.084 --> 01:27:41.188]  Dallas police want to join growing national trend by making all suspected drunken drivers take a blood test, but the price tag for such a program will be too high for now.
[01:27:41.569 --> 01:27:44.230]  Oh, that's the only problem is the federal money.
[01:27:45.509 --> 01:27:52.131]  And there's a federal think tank that recommends Art Acevedo and all other police chiefs, and they put in these people in all the big departments.
[01:27:52.151 --> 01:27:52.792]  They're feds!
[01:27:54.692 --> 01:27:56.953]  Can we have a Texan be our police chief in Austin?
[01:27:57.013 --> 01:27:57.253]  No!
[01:27:57.614 --> 01:27:59.074]  Can we have someone born in America?
[01:27:59.394 --> 01:27:59.634]  No!
[01:28:00.335 --> 01:28:05.997]  He's got to be a guy from Cuba to bring us Fidel Castro type situations.
[01:28:08.718 --> 01:28:09.798]  Why do we put up with this?
[01:28:11.239 --> 01:28:14.680]  You know, we need police chiefs from Detroit, Michigan.
[01:28:15.725 --> 01:28:17.126]  I mean, it's kind of like Congress.
[01:28:17.206 --> 01:28:21.328]  People that run for Congress, who've lived in the district two or three years, they never win.
[01:28:21.569 --> 01:28:24.570]  People say, no, we want somebody who's lived here a long time.
[01:28:25.211 --> 01:28:31.195]  Even better, somebody, you know, you can say what you want about Rick Perry and I don't like him, but the guy at least is a fourth generation Texan.
[01:28:31.215 --> 01:28:34.597]  I mean, at least we got a governor who's got some roots here.
[01:28:35.357 --> 01:28:37.318]  You're supposed to have roots where you are.
[01:28:37.618 --> 01:28:38.659]  What's wrong with people?
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:41.621]  Why do we have all these foreigner police chiefs?
[01:28:42.081 --> 01:28:43.022]  Not even an American!
[01:28:44.183 --> 01:28:44.663]  I've had it!
[01:28:46.124 --> 01:28:46.605]  I've had it!
[01:28:47.506 --> 01:28:51.211]  You think in Cuba they would have a guy from Texas be their police chief?
[01:28:51.752 --> 01:28:53.294]  I don't know, maybe if he depressed the people.
[01:28:54.596 --> 01:28:55.357]  Or from New York?
[01:28:55.737 --> 01:28:56.718]  No, they'd never do that.
[01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:58.261]  This is treason.
[01:28:59.182 --> 01:28:59.943]  And I'm sick of it!
[01:29:02.449 --> 01:29:08.173]  Under a proposed policy, the breathalyzer would become a thing of the past and police would seek a search warrant.
[01:29:08.333 --> 01:29:09.154]  That's not even true.
[01:29:09.594 --> 01:29:12.637]  To get blood from any suspected DU driver who refused to take the blood test.
[01:29:12.737 --> 01:29:12.957]  What?
[01:29:13.737 --> 01:29:16.119]  A preliminary figure showing it costs $360,000 a year.
[01:29:20.142 --> 01:29:21.063]  And it goes on from there.
[01:29:23.134 --> 01:29:23.794]  Look at this article.
[01:29:23.874 --> 01:29:24.654]  AP exclusive.
[01:29:24.674 --> 01:29:26.815]  Pentagon gun was from Tennessee police.
[01:29:27.255 --> 01:29:32.677]  And it turns out from the same police lock-up was the gun used in Nevada to shoot up that federal courthouse.
[01:29:34.137 --> 01:29:35.158]  How suspicious is that?
[01:29:36.198 --> 01:29:36.918]  Look at this article.
[01:29:37.078 --> 01:29:37.358]  U.S.
[01:29:37.378 --> 01:29:37.858]  and U.K.
[01:29:37.898 --> 01:29:39.639]  move closer to losing rating.
[01:29:39.859 --> 01:29:40.799]  Moody's says.
[01:29:41.119 --> 01:29:41.619]  Bloomberg.
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:43.180]  The U.S.
[01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:43.700]  and U.K.
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:47.581]  have moved substantially closer to losing their AAA credit rating.
[01:29:48.021 --> 01:29:49.822]  Mexico has a 1A.
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:30:02.264]  As the cost of servicing their debt rose, according to Moody's Investor Service, there is inertia in the deterioration of credit metrics.
[01:30:03.284 --> 01:30:05.585]  What that means is the bankers have got us where they want us.
[01:30:06.966 --> 01:30:10.067]  And the Federal Reserve is now buying U.S.
[01:30:10.127 --> 01:30:11.047]  debt from itself.
[01:30:13.548 --> 01:30:17.270]  They buy their own debt with our tax money.
[01:30:19.511 --> 01:30:20.531]  Let me say that again.
[01:30:21.528 --> 01:30:26.550]  They buy their own debt and make a profit off of it with our money.
[01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:30.131]  I mean, that's such a scam it doesn't even make sense.
[01:30:30.151 --> 01:30:31.491]  It doesn't even compute.
[01:30:32.011 --> 01:30:33.492]  And then they get all the power out of it.
[01:30:33.792 --> 01:30:34.852]  This is where they want you.
[01:30:35.593 --> 01:30:36.933]  They want you under their control.
[01:30:37.853 --> 01:30:39.594]  Do you know what's going to happen if this goes through?
[01:30:39.614 --> 01:30:41.654]  Do you know what's going to happen as the dollar plunges?
[01:30:41.855 --> 01:30:43.155]  We've lost almost all our industry.
[01:30:43.395 --> 01:30:45.136]  All we've got is the stinking dollar, folks.
[01:30:45.436 --> 01:30:49.317]  And they're killing it incrementally right now as we cover and follow the Republic.
[01:30:51.932 --> 01:30:56.178]  Okay, I'm going to briefly get into this, but I want to try to get this lady on in the next week.
[01:30:59.322 --> 01:31:04.990]  Remember last year, Richard Poplosky, a former Marine,
[01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:13.871]  Was completely drunk, got home at 3 a.m.
[01:31:14.291 --> 01:31:18.612]  The police report says he had one pit bull that was urinating all over the floor.
[01:31:18.632 --> 01:31:24.954]  You gotta love these young punks who get all these dogs and love their mommy and then complain when mommy doesn't want the dog crapping and urinating all over the floor.
[01:31:28.695 --> 01:31:36.037]  And he got a second pit bull and it was urinating and his mother said, those dogs go or you go.
[01:31:38.584 --> 01:31:41.446]  Then she calls the police to throw him and the dogs out.
[01:31:42.847 --> 01:31:44.288]  He has a tentered tantrum.
[01:31:45.309 --> 01:31:49.552]  The police pull up and he cold-bloodedly murders three of them.
[01:31:50.652 --> 01:31:59.138]  Now, when the Mexican troops or drug cartels kill cops, it's kept quiet, but because this guy was a citizen, they made a big deal out of it, and they should have.
[01:32:00.559 --> 01:32:04.262]  Within two hours of him being arrested, this is what creeps me out.
[01:32:06.952 --> 01:32:18.095]  It was in the newspaper, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, that he was a fan of Alex Jones, and they had some guy on the news pop up in front of his house and say he liked Alex Jones, and then put this weird smile on his face.
[01:32:19.816 --> 01:32:27.738]  Then we went and searched his name on our site, message boards attacking me, saying I'm bad, saying I'm evil, because I'm not a white supremacist.
[01:32:29.975 --> 01:32:30.736]  Never liked me.
[01:32:31.036 --> 01:32:31.876]  Never supported me.
[01:32:32.376 --> 01:32:33.437]  But that's not the issue.
[01:32:34.238 --> 01:32:37.059]  Within two hours, they were saying, Alex Jones did this.
[01:32:40.181 --> 01:32:41.202]  I'm the main target.
[01:32:41.582 --> 01:32:46.745]  And all the white supremacist groups, all of them, all the majors, it's come out over and over again, or feds.
[01:32:46.825 --> 01:32:53.289]  I told you a decade ago, Hal Turner was a fed attacking me, threatening to kill judges constantly, calling for violence constantly.
[01:32:53.549 --> 01:32:54.369]  It was cartoonish.
[01:32:54.409 --> 01:32:56.150]  Works with Sean Hannity before.
[01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:57.251]  Total operative.
[01:32:58.146 --> 01:33:09.552]  It came out in federal court three months ago, Kurt Nimmo, linked to the Chicago Tribune and other papers, as well as the Boston Globe, where it said the FBI testified and federal prosecutors testified, and he had one mistrial, they let him go.
[01:33:09.852 --> 01:33:11.393]  On that one, he's back in for another thing.
[01:33:11.734 --> 01:33:13.194]  He threatened a bunch of state judges.
[01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:14.355]  He said, kill them.
[01:33:14.775 --> 01:33:15.215]  Murder them.
[01:33:17.597 --> 01:33:20.919]  And so the states separately said, we don't care if he's a fed.
[01:33:20.999 --> 01:33:23.400]  So, looks like there's about to be another mistrial.
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:24.601]  In fact, pull that up for me.
[01:33:24.901 --> 01:33:26.542]  Hal Turner, AP, just click News.
[01:33:28.245 --> 01:33:29.946]  I covered it yesterday but I can't find it in the stack.
[01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:39.491]  He was a Fed and they said in the court documents we read on air that he's the highest level FBI agent there is.
[01:33:40.251 --> 01:33:43.072]  National security level.
[01:33:43.432 --> 01:33:44.773]  He's national security.
[01:33:45.313 --> 01:33:46.434]  So this is continuity of government.
[01:33:46.934 --> 01:33:49.635]  Not an asset, as I had said, an agent.
[01:33:52.277 --> 01:33:56.959]  Now the AP covers this up and just says Turner claims he's an asset and was drawing out violent people.
[01:34:00.066 --> 01:34:04.247]  The issue is, all the Nazi groups attack me 24-7 because they're fed run, folks.
[01:34:04.567 --> 01:34:06.728]  They don't like the show being effective against the banks.
[01:34:06.768 --> 01:34:07.348]  The New World Order.
[01:34:08.909 --> 01:34:09.549]  Hal Turner.
[01:34:11.410 --> 01:34:13.350]  A trained FBI agent provocateur.
[01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:13.950]  Scroll down.
[01:34:14.010 --> 01:34:16.011]  Kurt actually has screenshots of the court record.
[01:34:16.031 --> 01:34:18.872]  I think there's a link in that article.
[01:34:18.992 --> 01:34:20.452]  That may just be one of many Kurt's written.
[01:34:21.052 --> 01:34:22.253]  Yeah, there's the Associated Press.
[01:34:22.473 --> 01:34:23.853]  Oh, that's the article he did last week.
[01:34:23.893 --> 01:34:24.093]  Yeah.
[01:34:24.374 --> 01:34:27.074]  No, no, he had a previous one with the court documents from a few months ago.
[01:34:28.275 --> 01:34:28.735]  But, uh,
[01:34:29.861 --> 01:34:30.601]  Here's the issue.
[01:34:31.442 --> 01:34:35.965]  Within two hours, I'm in the headline.
[01:34:36.145 --> 01:34:37.145]  I caused it, I did it.
[01:34:37.205 --> 01:34:50.113]  Now, it turns out the writer that wrote this, and then we got a retraction from Raw Story, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, a bunch of other big, I think it was five retractions, saying, okay, Poplowski didn't like Alex Jones.
[01:34:50.133 --> 01:34:53.074]  Because I quietly said, look, I don't just threaten to sue people.
[01:34:53.895 --> 01:34:54.936]  I've sued people before.
[01:34:55.456 --> 01:34:58.978]  I don't want to waste time and money, but you just can't say I'm causing cop killing.
[01:35:01.363 --> 01:35:02.765]  I mean, you can't say this is my fault.
[01:35:02.845 --> 01:35:04.006]  I'm going to have to defend myself.
[01:35:04.266 --> 01:35:06.308]  This is dangerous telling cops that I'm causing this.
[01:35:06.829 --> 01:35:07.509]  They'll set me up.
[01:35:11.373 --> 01:35:13.816]  I mean, you're really sick in law enforcement on me to destroy me.
[01:35:14.076 --> 01:35:15.037]  And they did a retraction.
[01:35:16.459 --> 01:35:17.620]  But they didn't remove the original article.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:20.263]  They just wrote a separate article saying, well, Plosky didn't like Alex.
[01:35:20.563 --> 01:35:22.465]  But some of the publications did full retractions.
[01:35:24.761 --> 01:35:27.064]  Once I put the word out, because I was gonna have to sue him.
[01:35:27.144 --> 01:35:32.130]  I mean, you know, there's a lot of lies told about me, but you can't say I'm telling people to kill cops when I do the opposite, okay?
[01:35:32.891 --> 01:35:35.574]  I mean, that is dangerous, and I will sue you.
[01:35:37.717 --> 01:35:40.400]  Now, I just saw this this morning.
[01:35:43.032 --> 01:35:45.954]  This is an article out of Free Patriot Press.
[01:35:46.274 --> 01:35:50.437]  We've got it linked up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:50.557 --> 01:35:57.843]  Titled, Exclusive Interview with SPLC Director of Research, Heidi Bierich.
[01:36:02.199 --> 01:36:07.082]  The Southern Poverty Law Center recently issued an intelligence report on active patriot groups in the United States.
[01:36:07.883 --> 01:36:17.409]  And it basically says that anybody that talks about the New World Order is dangerous, and they list We Are Change, that's a total peace group, and they list myself, and now they're doing some cover story on me.
[01:36:17.449 --> 01:36:18.870]  They called me last week wanting quotes.
[01:36:22.212 --> 01:36:27.656]  And... In fact, I had that here in the article.
[01:36:27.696 --> 01:36:29.777]  Who's the lady that actually interviewed her?
[01:36:32.125 --> 01:36:32.965]  You're going to get it for me?
[01:36:33.606 --> 01:36:34.826]  I'm sorry, there's just so much here.
[01:36:38.909 --> 01:36:46.853]  But some local folks went in and talked to him, and I appreciate what they did, and they said, why are you demonizing We Are Change?
[01:36:46.873 --> 01:36:47.994]  And they say, like, they're God.
[01:36:48.554 --> 01:36:52.816]  Well, if you weren't putting out conspiracy theorists, we wouldn't put you on this list.
[01:36:52.897 --> 01:36:57.699]  Like, again, this is like Nazi Germany putting just whole groups of people on lists.
[01:36:57.739 --> 01:36:58.600]  It's a way to demonize.
[01:37:02.737 --> 01:37:04.118]  Rena McMasters, correct?
[01:37:04.738 --> 01:37:05.519]  That's later in the interview.
[01:37:06.279 --> 01:37:08.700]  So, we're going to play a short clip of this.
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:10.801]  Again, it's linked up on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[01:37:11.482 --> 01:37:18.885]  And here is the Director of Research for the entire Southern Poverty Law Center saying, I caused Poplosky to do this.
[01:37:19.066 --> 01:37:24.428]  These are the people that had their reporter, he writes stories about them and it's his beat.
[01:37:24.829 --> 01:37:28.951]  Promoting ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, demonizing groups, demonizing dissent.
[01:37:29.511 --> 01:37:36.973]  Within two hours, I get the blame, and now we hear it directly from the Southern Primary Law Center, in this recorded conversation.
[01:37:37.413 --> 01:37:42.454]  You can hear the whole 17 or 20 minute clip, whatever it is, up on the website, but here's a clip of it.
[01:37:42.794 --> 01:37:45.295]  Very bad things, and it happens all the time.
[01:37:46.095 --> 01:37:47.755]  So, this is what I have to say to you.
[01:37:47.935 --> 01:37:53.937]  If we are change doesn't want to be on the Patriot List, and you think these conspiracy theories are bad, get rid of them.
[01:37:54.717 --> 01:37:56.778]  Do you know where he got the idea to kill the cops?
[01:37:56.798 --> 01:37:57.498]  Alex Jones.
[01:37:58.019 --> 01:37:59.579]  He got the idea to kill cops from me!
[01:38:24.850 --> 01:38:25.991]  No evidence of that!
[01:38:26.792 --> 01:38:31.716]  Plosky attacked me on Stormfront's website on Infowars and Prison Planet.
[01:38:31.736 --> 01:38:33.417]  We went and pulled his stinking comments up.
[01:38:34.939 --> 01:38:38.982]  We forced retractions in five publications that I can remember.
[01:38:41.104 --> 01:38:46.689]  And here they are, in a taped interview, saying I made him do that.
[01:38:50.819 --> 01:38:52.380]  I mean, this is demonization.
[01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:53.680]  This is defamation.
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:54.761]  This is slander.
[01:38:55.121 --> 01:38:56.181]  This is outrageous.
[01:39:00.963 --> 01:39:01.504]  Play it again.
[01:39:01.624 --> 01:39:01.964]  Here it is.
[01:39:16.991 --> 01:39:19.693]  You have a legitimate political position you're trying to push.
[01:39:19.973 --> 01:39:20.133]  Yes.
[01:39:20.153 --> 01:39:21.334]  This is killing you.
[01:39:21.934 --> 01:39:22.975]  It makes you look like a jerk.
[01:39:24.276 --> 01:39:24.516]  Damn.
[01:39:24.536 --> 01:39:26.898]  Hey guys.
[01:39:27.398 --> 01:39:29.419]  Okay, so we did the interview.
[01:39:29.439 --> 01:39:30.500]  Alright.
[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:34.302]  And again, that's the end of the interview and there's a lot of other horrible stuff in there.
[01:39:34.803 --> 01:39:40.627]  But on record, on tape, in an interview, I gave him the idea.
[01:39:42.708 --> 01:39:43.909]  This is very dangerous.
[01:39:45.865 --> 01:39:57.932]  And we see the talking point from Glenn Beck on the fake right, and Chris Matthews on the controlled left, that you're a racist, you're a hater, you're a terrorist, you're bad, you're gonna do violence if you're in the Tea Party, if you're a birther, if you're a truther.
[01:39:58.473 --> 01:40:00.274]  And then voila, it starts happening.
[01:40:00.334 --> 01:40:04.476]  Bare minimum, it's causing mentally ill people to get the idea in their head to go out and do this.
[01:40:06.138 --> 01:40:10.200]  But I mean, just how outrageous does this have to get?
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:13.002]  How much more evil do we have to be
[01:40:14.761 --> 01:40:15.281]  Witness to.
[01:40:15.341 --> 01:40:17.182]  Now, let me go ahead and go to this fluoride clip.
[01:40:18.522 --> 01:40:20.663]  There's a story up on Infowars.com.
[01:40:21.483 --> 01:40:25.704]  Story on mystery substance distracts from fact fluoride is a deadly killer.
[01:40:26.684 --> 01:40:31.086]  We're talking about other poisons that might be in the fluoride from China that they're putting in drinking water.
[01:40:31.806 --> 01:40:34.567]  It's clogging up these Massachusetts water systems.
[01:40:35.907 --> 01:40:38.668]  Then, the newscast shows a bag of the fluoride.
[01:40:38.968 --> 01:40:42.389]  It says danger, poison, toxic by ingestion, target organs.
[01:40:43.274 --> 01:40:48.142]  Heart, kidneys, bones, central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, teeth.
[01:40:48.623 --> 01:40:49.725]  Target organs.
[01:40:49.945 --> 01:40:50.466]  Danger.
[01:40:50.927 --> 01:40:51.808]  They're targeting you.
[01:40:51.868 --> 01:40:54.733]  It's on the bag, but they're saying forget that it says it's poison.
[01:40:54.913 --> 01:40:56.576]  Could there be other poison being added?
[01:40:56.836 --> 01:40:57.678]  Let's start going to the clip.
[01:41:00.529 --> 01:41:08.136]  Water in Amesbury is supposed to have fluoride in it, but Rob Demaris has been concerned for years about what's in the supply he gets from China.
[01:41:08.576 --> 01:41:13.700]  The residue you see here is what won't dissolve when he puts the fluoride powder in the water.
[01:41:14.101 --> 01:41:14.761]  What is that?
[01:41:15.102 --> 01:41:15.602]  We don't know.
[01:41:15.762 --> 01:41:17.203]  You have no idea what's in there?
[01:41:17.444 --> 01:41:18.044]  I don't know what it is.
[01:41:18.124 --> 01:41:19.025]  It's not soluble.
[01:41:20.226 --> 01:41:24.470]  And it doesn't appear to be sodium fluoride, so we're not quite sure what it is.
[01:41:24.850 --> 01:41:29.851]  Damaris says the residue clogs his machines and makes it difficult to get a consistent mix.
[01:41:30.352 --> 01:41:39.994]  For almost a year, these fluoride pumps in Amesbury have been off, and the Water Department says they'll stay off until they can figure out what's in the fluoride.
[01:41:40.014 --> 01:41:50.437]  The Department of Public Health says more than 650,000 customers in 44 communities are getting the product in question, and only Amesbury has temporarily stopped using it.
[01:41:50.817 --> 01:41:53.259]  But despite those concerns, we want to be clear.
[01:41:53.339 --> 01:41:58.843]  Both state and federal health officials tell Team 5 Investigates, Chinese fluoride is safe.
[01:41:58.863 --> 01:41:59.804]  Alright, hit pause.
[01:42:01.545 --> 01:42:08.050]  And we're going to play when we come back from break, but health officials say Chinese fluoride is safe.
[01:42:09.471 --> 01:42:15.656]  Under the federal regulations, they're allowed to put over 300 chemicals in your water under the name sodium fluoride.
[01:42:16.857 --> 01:42:19.738]  So there's mercury, lead, arsenic, aluminum.
[01:42:20.038 --> 01:42:25.859]  This is the toxic waste from nuclear weapons production, aluminum production, and fertilizer production.
[01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:26.600]  On record!
[01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:33.041]  And they know it's a deadly chemical that attacks the bones, the brain, reduces fertility, increases cancer.
[01:42:33.061 --> 01:42:34.042]  That's all the studies.
[01:42:34.562 --> 01:42:36.242]  But this newscast isn't about that.
[01:42:36.302 --> 01:42:38.143]  Oh, here's a bag that says deadly poison.
[01:42:38.883 --> 01:42:40.044]  The deadly poison's good.
[01:42:40.084 --> 01:42:42.445]  We're worried a mystery substance is in this.
[01:42:42.745 --> 01:42:43.825]  That's what it is!
[01:42:44.485 --> 01:42:47.967]  It's a mystery substance because they're allowed to put whatever they want.
[01:42:48.347 --> 01:42:58.851]  Like cigarette companies under their patents can put hundreds of deadly chemicals in the cigarettes and not even tell you what's in it because it's a trade secret, a mystery ingredient, a mystery sauce.
[01:42:59.151 --> 01:43:00.132]  The super sauce!
[01:43:00.692 --> 01:43:09.102]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[01:43:09.402 --> 01:43:15.088]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[01:43:15.389 --> 01:43:21.936]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[01:43:22.481 --> 01:43:25.745]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[01:43:25.885 --> 01:43:28.127]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[01:44:01.171 --> 01:44:04.852]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:44:05.192 --> 01:44:08.213]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:08.433 --> 01:44:09.854]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:44:10.552 --> 01:44:13.213]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:13.233 --> 01:44:19.455]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:19.635 --> 01:44:24.637]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:25.157 --> 01:44:27.958]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:44:28.079 --> 01:44:34.781]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:34.901 --> 01:44:37.022]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:37.262 --> 01:44:38.582]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:38.842 --> 01:44:41.123]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:41.303 --> 01:44:43.164]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:43.444 --> 01:44:48.265]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:48.566 --> 01:44:53.367]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:45:28.872 --> 01:45:38.158]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:45:38.198 --> 01:45:45.143]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:45:45.263 --> 01:45:46.104]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:45:46.144 --> 01:45:49.246]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[01:45:49.386 --> 01:45:50.206]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[01:45:51.927 --> 01:45:52.208]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:46:03.157 --> 01:46:04.638]  Well, it's the final segment.
[01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:11.806]  I had Noah Taylor, big Hollywood star, on talking about the New World Order for 45 minutes of the first hour.
[01:46:11.826 --> 01:46:18.973]  You'll definitely want to check that out in the retransmission on the audio streams at Infowars.com or subscribe to the free podcast.
[01:46:19.434 --> 01:46:20.815]  Don't forget that if you have a
[01:46:22.779 --> 01:46:33.102]  iPhone or your friends or family have an iPhone, you can go to InfoWars.com, get the link, and send it to your friends and family or neighbors or co-workers to the free iPhone 5-star app.
[01:46:33.942 --> 01:46:37.143]  We appreciate everybody's 5-star ratings there.
[01:46:37.203 --> 01:46:38.623]  It's pretty much a perfect app.
[01:46:40.183 --> 01:46:44.805]  There's like 60 haters in there desperately downloading it, trying to knock off its 5 stars.
[01:46:44.845 --> 01:46:46.225]  So folks, go on there and give it 5 stars.
[01:46:47.996 --> 01:46:53.722]  Talk about desperation, lying about an app to try to knock it off five stars, because not many apps have five stars.
[01:46:55.604 --> 01:46:59.327]  Story on mystery substance distracts from fact fluoride is deadly killer.
[01:46:59.668 --> 01:47:01.209]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[01:47:01.289 --> 01:47:07.175]  Everybody should get this article because it has all the government documents and links to the cancer, the brain damage, the infertility, all the proof.
[01:47:07.495 --> 01:47:09.837]  But again, talk about a psychological bait-and-switch.
[01:47:10.954 --> 01:47:15.835]  On the bag, it says, danger, poison, toxic by ingestion, target organs.
[01:47:15.995 --> 01:47:16.815]  That's what they're targeting.
[01:47:17.176 --> 01:47:20.977]  The heart, kidneys, bones, central nervous system, gastrointestinal system.
[01:47:21.117 --> 01:47:22.397]  Deadly poison.
[01:47:23.297 --> 01:47:24.377]  But that's not the problem.
[01:47:24.397 --> 01:47:26.018]  They're worried something else might be in it.
[01:47:26.998 --> 01:47:31.759]  And they're very worried the people aren't getting their fluoride in this one community.
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:34.560]  Let's go ahead and continue with the clip.
[01:47:35.162 --> 01:47:41.006]  The company which supplies the fluoride in question says it is certified by the National Sanitation Foundation.
[01:47:41.026 --> 01:47:43.308]  It allows you to put whatever poison you want in it.
[01:47:43.948 --> 01:47:53.294]  And despite a thousand complaints, the Centers for Disease Control also says it's safe, although testing continues to determine the precise composition of the residue.
[01:47:53.715 --> 01:47:56.517]  They should test it to make sure that what they're putting in is safe for us to drink.
[01:47:56.797 --> 01:48:01.900]  Paul Stewart lives in Newburyport and believes he has a right to know exactly what's in his water.
[01:48:02.981 --> 01:48:03.762]  Look at this spin!
[01:48:04.363 --> 01:48:08.068]  Oh, I want my fluoride, I want to make sure whatever else is in there is safe.
[01:48:08.308 --> 01:48:17.341]  The fluoride isn't not just safe, it's a chemical weapon used by the communists in Russia and Nazi Germany, by the fascists, to brain damage and make people servile.
[01:48:17.581 --> 01:48:19.283]  That's what it does, like lithium.
[01:48:20.242 --> 01:48:21.282]  Do you understand?
[01:48:21.322 --> 01:48:22.803]  You're being forcibly medicated.
[01:48:23.003 --> 01:48:23.503]  Continue.
[01:48:23.623 --> 01:48:32.266]  On the same day that I read the story about the fluoride coming from China, I also read stories about the melamine that was being contaminated in the milk products coming from China.
[01:48:32.686 --> 01:48:39.409]  That, you know, Abercrombie & Fitch actually pulled some of their jewelry off the shelves because it was contaminated with cadmium coming from China.
[01:48:39.729 --> 01:48:42.710]  And then we had another story about more lead in kids toys coming from China.
[01:48:43.090 --> 01:48:50.915]  Since 2007, most of the sodium fluoride has also been imported from China because it's the least expensive on the market.
[01:48:51.095 --> 01:48:55.117]  I don't think that when it comes to something that I ingest every day, the lowest bidder is good enough.
[01:48:55.438 --> 01:48:57.879]  I'd like to be able to add it in, you know, worry-free.
[01:48:58.179 --> 01:48:59.360]  Oh, he'd like to help us.
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:00.381]  I'm Kelly Tuthill.
[01:49:00.961 --> 01:49:02.202]  Oh, he'd like to help us.
[01:49:03.928 --> 01:49:05.409]  This is the brainwashing.
[01:49:05.549 --> 01:49:06.830]  This is the mind control.
[01:49:06.910 --> 01:49:17.638]  They're adding sodium fluoride, and that's a catch-all name for hundreds of chemicals, to your water because it's a toxic waste that these companies would have to store or get rid of.
[01:49:19.379 --> 01:49:27.064]  But instead, they sell it to you, and you pay to be brain damaged, and pay to develop cancer, and pay to dumb your children down.
[01:49:28.365 --> 01:49:32.248]  This is like banging your kid's head up against the wall once a week.
[01:49:33.362 --> 01:49:34.403]  I've seen major studies.
[01:49:34.523 --> 01:49:40.129]  You lose as much as 10 IQ points in just four to five years of ingesting one part per million of fluoride.
[01:49:40.309 --> 01:49:45.955]  And that's not counting the toothpaste that says on the back, if you swallow more than a pea size, call poison control immediately.
[01:49:46.176 --> 01:49:48.478]  They're now springing on crops as a pesticide.
[01:49:48.518 --> 01:49:49.439]  Yeah, it kills bugs!
[01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:51.501]  But then it goes into the crops and you eat it.
[01:49:52.282 --> 01:49:53.522]  It's in most of the processed food.
[01:49:53.762 --> 01:49:54.883]  They're adding it everywhere now.
[01:49:54.903 --> 01:49:56.483]  Because you're going to love your government.
[01:49:56.843 --> 01:50:02.065]  You're going to accept the warrantless blood taking checkpoints and the laptops they give your school kids watching you at home.
[01:50:02.585 --> 01:50:05.165]  And the chemtrails and the tyranny in the foreign banks.
[01:50:05.406 --> 01:50:10.587]  Because you're so chemically poisoned and docile you can't even get angry.
[01:50:11.107 --> 01:50:12.508]  The testosterone's lowering.
[01:50:12.548 --> 01:50:13.248]  Fluoride does that.
[01:50:13.348 --> 01:50:15.469]  The sperm counts have plunged by over 85%.
[01:50:15.989 --> 01:50:17.790]  You are under chemical attack.
[01:50:18.210 --> 01:50:19.610]  You are being brain damaged.
[01:50:19.690 --> 01:50:25.933]  Our life expectancy's gone down if you average out the infant deaths they used to have 100 years ago.
[01:50:26.173 --> 01:50:30.915]  People live longer then if you averaged out those deaths of children dying when they were young.
[01:50:31.795 --> 01:50:32.915]  Alright, we're out of time.
[01:50:32.975 --> 01:50:34.076]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:50:34.096 --> 01:50:35.636]  Key interview with Noah Taylor.
[01:50:35.836 --> 01:50:36.317]  Straight ahead.
[01:50:36.537 --> 01:50:37.137]  Great job, crew.
