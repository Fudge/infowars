[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.644]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:09.245 --> 00:00:12.006]  We're live, well into hour number three.
[00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:16.109]  It is Monday, the 28th day of June 2010.
[00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.152]  Got about two hours left in worldwide broadcast today.
[00:00:20.172 --> 00:00:24.454]  I'm going to continue with your calls and in the next segment I'm going to get back into the news.
[00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:26.756]  Justices extend gun right
[00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:29.786]  To gun owners nationwide.
[00:00:30.187 --> 00:00:31.688]  That's the Washington Post headline.
[00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:32.969]  That is not true.
[00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.152]  Justices extend gun owner rights nationwide.
[00:00:37.893 --> 00:00:45.640]  What they did was for the first time ever rule that state and city governments can restrict the Second Amendment.
[00:00:46.638 --> 00:00:50.481]  That was one of the federal rights in the Bill of Rights that could not be touched.
[00:00:50.902 --> 00:00:56.406]  And they're now saying, you can basically completely ban guns.
[00:00:56.426 --> 00:01:00.229]  You've just got to claim that that's what the Second Amendment is.
[00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.910]  And that's what the ruling says.
[00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:05.092]  And that's what Handgun Control Incorporated is celebrating.
[00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:06.613]  They're saying, we finally got them.
[00:01:06.953 --> 00:01:08.013]  We're going to get their guns.
[00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.754]  And the media is going to spin this.
[00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:15.676]  Oh yeah, you know, they finally changed the rules in Chicago.
[00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:24.160]  If the sheriff or the mayor, the mob boss, says you can have a gun, then you pay all these fines and fees, then maybe, maybe,
[00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.315]  So that's just so the mafia crooks can have guns themselves and you can't.
[00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:29.636]  It'll be the New York model.
[00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:32.658]  And we're going to get some constitutional lawyers on the next few days about that.
[00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:36.560]  Senators signal a contentious hearing on Supreme Court nominee.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.763]  That's going on right now with Elena Kagan.
[00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:46.767]  And we'll put an image of her when she's testifying up on screen because all day she's been scowling.
[00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:51.190]  Just a crazed, I mean it's hard to hold a
[00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.728]  angry scowling look for more than thirty seconds and she's just like a cornered animal just
[00:02:02.165 --> 00:02:05.587]  Just literally, I've never seen anything like this in a hearing going on before.
[00:02:06.427 --> 00:02:08.008]  Amazing, so we'll be talking about that.
[00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:10.569]  New York Times, the third depression.
[00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:17.432]  Paul Krugman tells it like it is and says, look, by every real economic benchmark and indicator, we're in a depression, New York Times.
[00:02:18.073 --> 00:02:26.157]  RBS tells clients to prepare for monster money printing by Federal Reserve, devaluation of currency, that's London Telegraph.
[00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:31.900]  Bird's death may imperil finance reform bill, which that's a good thing.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.923]  I mean, I'm sad he's dead, though I'm not really a fan of the Ku Klux Klan or anything.
[00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:43.167]  Mr. New World Order Senator Robert Bird is dead.
[00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:46.950]  Died overnight.
[00:02:49.662 --> 00:02:51.043]  They just put her back up on television.
[00:02:51.163 --> 00:02:53.445]  I can't believe they told her to stop that scowling.
[00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:59.609]  I mean, I would think somebody would tap her on the arm two hours into her testimony and say, listen, you look like a complete psychopath.
[00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.951]  You look like a crazed demon.
[00:03:02.631 --> 00:03:04.432]  You look like the Wicked Witch of the East.
[00:03:04.492 --> 00:03:06.053]  You've got to stop.
[00:03:06.113 --> 00:03:07.394]  You've got to smile some.
[00:03:07.414 --> 00:03:11.217]  You know, we put some clown makeup on you and put some pearls on you.
[00:03:11.237 --> 00:03:12.738]  You look shifty-eyed and hateful.
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.200]  Oh, man.
[00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:17.501]  Take her down.
[00:03:17.661 --> 00:03:18.121]  Take her down.
[00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:18.701]  Fast.
[00:03:19.941 --> 00:03:21.062]  I'm sorry, I got distracted.
[00:03:21.102 --> 00:03:22.222]  I cannot look at that woman.
[00:03:23.363 --> 00:03:26.404]  Just because I know she's the embodiment of anti-American tyranny.
[00:03:26.444 --> 00:03:29.125]  Hold on, let me just get some air for a minute.
[00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:36.567]  God, why have you put people over this, like, to rule me and my family?
[00:03:36.727 --> 00:03:37.467]  What did we do?
[00:03:38.128 --> 00:03:39.968]  I know we killed 50 million babies in America.
[00:03:40.108 --> 00:03:40.848]  I know we're evil.
[00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:41.649]  I know we're decadent.
[00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:42.969]  But we're not all that evil.
[00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:45.090]  Please, please protect our country.
[00:03:46.647 --> 00:03:48.588]  Please don't put this type of evil over us.
[00:03:48.688 --> 00:03:50.249]  Please, please, please.
[00:03:54.732 --> 00:03:57.814]  God, why won't the average people out there wake up and take action?
[00:03:57.914 --> 00:03:59.255]  Why are we so domesticated?
[00:04:00.516 --> 00:04:02.497]  And God says, because you're decadent slugs.
[00:04:02.517 --> 00:04:03.198]  What do you expect?
[00:04:04.238 --> 00:04:05.119]  That's God's answer.
[00:04:07.821 --> 00:04:14.225]  Soft, demonic, worldly scum, Sodom and Gomorrah, Rome, we are going to fall.
[00:04:15.902 --> 00:04:22.430]  And in the fall of America, all of the soft slugs are going to be salted, and they're going to get what they want.
[00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:24.353]  So I guess God's saying, I'm going to give you the answer.
[00:04:24.974 --> 00:04:30.060]  I'm accelerating this case of scurvy that you have.
[00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:31.642]  I'm letting it come to a head.
[00:04:32.483 --> 00:04:33.645]  I guess that's what God would say.
[00:04:41.724 --> 00:04:44.425]  I mean, the financial reform bill is not a financial reform bill.
[00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:50.607]  The headline should be, financial reform bill is Federal Reserve complete power grab and takeover of society.
[00:04:50.647 --> 00:04:52.487]  Even the Washington Post admitted that yesterday.
[00:04:53.547 --> 00:05:09.352]  They admitted that 600 trillion, conservatively in derivatives, more like 1.5 quadrillion, 1,500, triple that, or right at triple, that it allows the private inner group that has Federal Reserve membership to take over any other institutions they want, unlimited power,
[00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:12.853]  The Washington Post said almost unlimited.
[00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:15.235]  Somewhere here in my stack.
[00:05:15.275 --> 00:05:16.496]  I'll find it and go back over it.
[00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:17.436]  I covered it Sunday.
[00:05:17.476 --> 00:05:18.657]  I covered it Friday.
[00:05:19.337 --> 00:05:22.279]  Again, there is a surrealness to all of this.
[00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:24.260]  It's so naked.
[00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:28.263]  It's the Federal Reserve that's annihilated us.
[00:05:28.983 --> 00:05:30.964]  That's the reason the dollar's being devalued.
[00:05:31.004 --> 00:05:32.665]  It's the reason we're in a depression.
[00:05:37.528 --> 00:05:38.789]  It isn't a reform.
[00:05:40.592 --> 00:05:41.713]  To give them more power?
[00:05:43.154 --> 00:05:47.757]  People think of the word reform as something good, but in lawyer speak it just means to change.
[00:05:48.357 --> 00:05:49.538]  So it is a reform.
[00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:53.100]  I guess Hitler being elected was a reform.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.222]  It was a bad reform in 33, but it was a reform.
[00:05:56.582 --> 00:05:58.864]  It was certainly change, a time of change.
[00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:03.907]  I guess Stalin was a reform, but not a good one.
[00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.672]  We had a Bill of Rights and Constitution to protect us from being robbed by tyrants.
[00:06:12.913 --> 00:06:17.216]  And when it's gone, folks, 100% of the time, you will be run over.
[00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:21.659]  You will live like they do in third world countries, because they were robbed by the elite.
[00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:24.360]  It's all going to be gone very soon.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.403]  You can already see it draining away, like pulling the plug on a bathtub.
[00:06:29.923 --> 00:06:33.886]  And the water's going down, you see the whirlpool, and the last bit's draining away.
[00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.620]  And the globalists we've got running things have shown themselves to be very bloody.
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.821]  This isn't just going to be some corrupt system.
[00:06:42.841 --> 00:06:45.822]  This is going to be a hot persecution and arrest.
[00:06:45.922 --> 00:06:48.363]  And they want to revel in our blood.
[00:06:48.423 --> 00:06:49.104]  You understand that?
[00:06:50.264 --> 00:06:51.685]  These are aggressive people.
[00:06:52.525 --> 00:06:53.665]  Come on in to take it!
[00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:57.467]  Look how Kagan's just looking at those Senators for hours.
[00:06:59.531 --> 00:07:00.292]  She's just proud.
[00:07:00.332 --> 00:07:02.494]  I'm not going to come in here and be intimidated.
[00:07:02.814 --> 00:07:04.836]  The people that bought and paid for you are putting me in.
[00:07:05.077 --> 00:07:05.477]  Take it!
[00:07:06.118 --> 00:07:07.439]  She's just... Take it!
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.680]  Take it!
[00:07:11.023 --> 00:07:11.984]  She's just looking up there.
[00:07:12.004 --> 00:07:13.365]  She's been giving briefings on everyone.
[00:07:13.525 --> 00:07:15.307]  That senator's in money laundering.
[00:07:15.347 --> 00:07:16.809]  That senator likes boys.
[00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:19.351]  That senator likes to cheat on his wife.
[00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:21.233]  That senator's been paid off.
[00:07:21.253 --> 00:07:21.614]  She's just...
[00:07:24.022 --> 00:07:26.644]  She's just up there and she knows she's going to get your guns.
[00:07:27.404 --> 00:07:29.946]  She knows she's going to get your private property.
[00:07:29.986 --> 00:07:31.787]  She knows she's going to ban your free speech.
[00:07:32.067 --> 00:07:35.729]  She's going to disappear your free speech, however she wants, whenever she wants.
[00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:38.671]  And she thinks there's nothing you're going to do about it.
[00:07:38.971 --> 00:07:41.052]  All those senators were looking down when they talked to her.
[00:07:41.432 --> 00:07:42.853]  All of them cowed by her.
[00:07:44.074 --> 00:07:45.175]  Every single one of them.
[00:07:45.495 --> 00:07:48.036]  And she just... I've never seen somebody in a hearing.
[00:07:48.056 --> 00:07:52.479]  I mean, a few times she was actually going... You'd see the little teeth.
[00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:58.801]  America's mine!
[00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:00.062]  Mine!
[00:08:00.562 --> 00:08:01.883]  I'm Elena Kagan!
[00:08:06.167 --> 00:08:13.955]  It actually makes my heart fail to know what we're going to go through.
[00:08:16.636 --> 00:08:17.998]  I actually get a butterfly flutter.
[00:08:18.058 --> 00:08:18.338]  You know what?
[00:08:18.499 --> 00:08:19.200]  A fight or flight.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.742]  My body actually like, prepare for battle!
[00:08:20.762 --> 00:08:22.324]  I mean, all my instincts.
[00:08:22.805 --> 00:08:23.225]  Get ready!
[00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:24.527]  This is it!
[00:08:25.188 --> 00:08:25.809]  They're coming in!
[00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:27.011]  It's worse than you thought!
[00:08:28.273 --> 00:08:29.955]  They're openly announcing the end of the web.
[00:08:29.975 --> 00:08:31.257]  They're openly announcing everything.
[00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:32.399]  They're going to rob everything!
[00:08:39.813 --> 00:08:42.034]  And Americans are a bunch of smiley face people.
[00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:43.554]  I mean, most Americans are great people.
[00:08:44.014 --> 00:08:47.775]  They're smiley, they're happy, they're goofy, they're arrested development like little kids.
[00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:54.937]  A nation of children having no idea the ballgame they're in, no idea what they're facing, no idea the stakes.
[00:08:56.557 --> 00:08:59.018]  Let's go to Father Jones and then John Eric and others.
[00:08:59.058 --> 00:09:02.778]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Father Jones from Chicago.
[00:09:02.798 --> 00:09:05.919]  Son, it's dad.
[00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:06.919]  How you doing?
[00:09:09.741 --> 00:09:21.564]  July 1st is the happy 94th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme, where the Krauts knocked off 5,100 Tommy Limeys, and I just wanted to congratulate the hereditary MOI man, Monkton, on it.
[00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:22.044]  Thank you.
[00:09:24.385 --> 00:09:26.946]  What a bizarre call, man, I tell you what.
[00:09:28.717 --> 00:09:29.938]  That's insane.
[00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:31.159]  You know what?
[00:09:31.199 --> 00:09:36.003]  The British, the Germans, everybody in that war got played by the big banks that set up these wars.
[00:09:36.764 --> 00:09:41.328]  And you're just a completely bizarre statement.
[00:09:42.088 --> 00:09:43.990]  Let's talk to John in Canada.
[00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.810]  You're on the air.
[00:09:45.171 --> 00:09:46.572]  He was detained at G20.
[00:09:46.632 --> 00:09:52.897]  Lots of people calling in detained in the land of the free and home of the brave up north.
[00:09:53.537 --> 00:09:56.740]  I tell you, I've told you for years, Canada's one of the worst police states I've ever seen.
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:57.661]  Go ahead, John.
[00:09:59.537 --> 00:10:04.701]  Alex, this is the Canadian John Galt, first-time caller, long-time listener, Prison Planet subscriber.
[00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:05.581]  Welcome.
[00:10:06.322 --> 00:10:10.865]  I was one of the people who was detained for no reason, forced to stand in the rain for hours.
[00:10:12.926 --> 00:10:16.369]  People were getting drenched, people were freezing cold, having their equipment destroyed.
[00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:20.932]  Yeah, well you don't protest the bankers that are robbing you, the cops are going to show you, little man!
[00:10:20.952 --> 00:10:27.776]  Well, you know, we had some signs, and we were talking to police all along, and they loved our signs.
[00:10:27.816 --> 00:10:28.657]  They know all about it.
[00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:31.671]  It was amazing.
[00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:40.493]  Oh, so the regular cops are good, but the special little political units, because the word I've gotten from countless people that have been detained was they enjoyed it.
[00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:46.554]  Well, you know, they didn't seem to know what the heck was going on, to tell you the truth.
[00:10:46.914 --> 00:10:48.835]  They were just following their orders, right?
[00:10:49.235 --> 00:10:55.236]  But the thing is that about half of them, they were telling me about 9-11 and the New World Order.
[00:10:55.876 --> 00:10:58.977]  The only thing they didn't seem to know about was the agent provocateur.
[00:10:58.997 --> 00:10:59.817]  They didn't even believe it.
[00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:12.376]  Well, you know, I talk about cops a lot, and the media shows us the bad examples of what police do, but most cops I talk to are actually salt of the earth.
[00:11:13.577 --> 00:11:21.703]  And it's a media psyop that we all fall into when they constantly show the few cops that are really doing bad things.
[00:11:22.504 --> 00:11:28.028]  That's to make the public not like the cops, and the cops feel like we don't like them, and so it's to divide us.
[00:11:28.809 --> 00:11:33.630]  It's just like that restaurant yesterday where the cops came in and everybody got quiet for 10 minutes and I couldn't handle it anymore.
[00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:34.610]  I went over and talked to them.
[00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.051]  We've got to talk to fellow citizens.
[00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:38.151]  We've got to talk to police.
[00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:39.451]  And that's good news.
[00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:47.513]  But I talked to the Love Police, you know, fellow that got arrested, Charlie Veach, and he said they did enjoy, you know, arresting him for no reason and humiliating him.
[00:11:47.553 --> 00:11:53.054]  But that's good news that a lot of police, even though they follow the illegal orders, did not like what they were doing.
[00:11:53.634 --> 00:11:54.354]  Look at Spain.
[00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:01.111]  The official police union for the state of Catalonia said, look, we shouldn't have done this and we don't appreciate being told to do it.
[00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:02.511]  Global meltdowns.
[00:12:02.871 --> 00:12:03.912]  Massive unemployment.
[00:12:04.272 --> 00:12:05.072]  Endless wars.
[00:12:05.492 --> 00:12:06.732]  A new currency crisis.
[00:12:07.132 --> 00:12:08.872]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[00:12:09.212 --> 00:12:11.073]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:12:11.373 --> 00:12:12.993]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[00:12:13.273 --> 00:12:14.973]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.

[00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:03.865]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[00:14:04.145 --> 00:14:09.349]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.851]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:14:12.032 --> 00:14:14.814]  Are the majority of your assets tied up in the stock or bond market?
[00:14:15.014 --> 00:14:17.916]  If so, are those assets working for you or against you?
[00:14:18.136 --> 00:14:26.163]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens to our economy or the dollar, your investment will never be worthless.
[00:14:26.383 --> 00:14:28.124]  And it'll protect you from that hidden tax.
[00:14:28.484 --> 00:14:29.004]  Inflation.
[00:14:29.224 --> 00:14:33.606]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals, the time is now.
[00:14:33.767 --> 00:14:36.268]  Gold is at an all-time high and continues to move up.
[00:14:36.448 --> 00:14:36.908]  I can help.
[00:14:37.048 --> 00:14:37.688]  Call me today.

[00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:12.484]  The Financial Times of London is reporting that cyber security measures will mandate government ID tokens to use the internet.
[00:16:12.965 --> 00:16:21.350]  You will now have an ID, NSA controlled, run by the four branches of the military that divide it up, to be able to get on the internet.
[00:16:22.831 --> 00:16:29.236]  The FCC is separately proposing a black box or software on your computer that reports everything you're doing and blocks content.
[00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:32.610]  But also tracks what you're doing.
[00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.891]  I mean, this is America they're talking about.
[00:16:35.971 --> 00:16:39.212]  The government controlling every facet of your internet surfing.
[00:16:39.893 --> 00:16:42.954]  Financial Times of London, Paul Watson has a key article.
[00:16:43.534 --> 00:16:51.117]  Cybersecurity measure will mandate government ID tokens to use the internet from that FT article, but he expands it and gives you the background.
[00:16:51.437 --> 00:16:55.439]  That article is so important that that get out to everyone now.
[00:16:56.991 --> 00:16:58.531]  And we're really breaking through on this.
[00:16:58.691 --> 00:17:03.693]  Our analysis of the bill was the top story Sunday morning.
[00:17:03.793 --> 00:17:05.513]  The entire big link on Drudge.
[00:17:05.893 --> 00:17:06.814]  We've never had that before.
[00:17:06.834 --> 00:17:14.696]  You know, the top huge headline was President to be able to take emergency control of the internet for four months before it's even reviewed.
[00:17:17.457 --> 00:17:18.457]  All right, enough of that.
[00:17:18.477 --> 00:17:21.218]  I said I'm going to get to the calls, and so we're going to keep going to those.
[00:17:21.238 --> 00:17:22.318]  Then I'll get to the news coming up.
[00:17:24.548 --> 00:17:26.369]  I mean, we're covering the news, taking your calls.
[00:17:26.889 --> 00:17:27.770]  Is Zach still there?
[00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.711]  Or John?
[00:17:30.931 --> 00:17:32.572]  John, real fast, finish up your story.
[00:17:32.632 --> 00:17:34.713]  So you were standing in the rain, finish up.
[00:17:36.294 --> 00:17:41.077]  Yeah, well, they had us standing there and they wouldn't tell us why we were there, why we were being held.
[00:17:41.097 --> 00:17:44.258]  You know, everybody's electronics were being destroyed.
[00:17:44.739 --> 00:17:48.500]  But, you know, there's some other good that came out of my weekend down there.
[00:17:49.141 --> 00:17:51.282]  I can't tell you how many people ran up to me and
[00:17:51.778 --> 00:17:55.824]  Wanted to find out more information, other fellow InfoWarriors, everywhere I went.
[00:17:56.285 --> 00:17:57.287]  People are waking up.
[00:17:57.347 --> 00:17:59.791]  It's like we're reaching the tipping point here.
[00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:07.415]  Well, how dare you, you know, try to go out and talk to fellow Canadians on the street?
[00:18:07.536 --> 00:18:11.359]  I mean, that'll get you disappeared in the new world order.
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:18.026]  I tell you, this is, folks, can you believe there's actually people that try to go out and stand up against the banks that are swindling us?
[00:18:18.647 --> 00:18:21.970]  We need to do like they've done in Greece and just hand the entire infrastructure over to them.
[00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:23.832]  But you'll learn your lesson.
[00:18:24.273 --> 00:18:28.437]  You'll learn your lesson, John, to submit to the bankers and to Elena Kagan and everybody else.
[00:18:29.078 --> 00:18:31.320]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric in Texas.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.161]  Eric, you're on the air.
[00:18:34.003 --> 00:18:34.744]  Yeah Alex, can you hear me?
[00:18:34.944 --> 00:18:35.284]  Yes, sir.
[00:18:38.268 --> 00:18:43.994]  Austin Ipe, by birth, and I've been watching you since you were on Access Cable TV, by the way.
[00:18:44.094 --> 00:18:46.437]  Do you have an authorization to call in on the radio?
[00:18:46.497 --> 00:18:53.584]  Because if they can ban us out protesting, then they can ban us on the internet in our free speech, and next they'll ban calling in to talk radio.
[00:18:54.224 --> 00:18:58.409]  Do you need to be arrested, sir, calling into a talk show for your First Amendment?
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:00.480]  I hope not.
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.402]  Well, no, the FCC is proposing shutting this show off.
[00:19:03.422 --> 00:19:06.803]  I mean, they're openly saying, shut down talk radio.
[00:19:06.903 --> 00:19:09.765]  So, I mean, really, I'm not even being sarcastic now.
[00:19:10.045 --> 00:19:14.267]  In the near future, Eric, maybe it is wrong you're calling into a show.
[00:19:14.567 --> 00:19:16.468]  Maybe Elena Kagan's right.
[00:19:16.908 --> 00:19:19.029]  Maybe all these people are right.
[00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:29.218]  Anyway, did you hear me say, I've been watching you since you were on AXS TV in Austin, late 90s, something like that.
[00:19:29.579 --> 00:19:30.219]  Welcome, sir.
[00:19:31.919 --> 00:19:39.322]  Anyway, I wanted to call to tell you about what appears to be potentially a FEMA location that's being built in our area.
[00:19:40.203 --> 00:19:42.564]  Talking about the old mall?
[00:19:43.864 --> 00:19:49.827]  No, actually, on 183 and 29, there's an area called Stewart's Junction.
[00:19:50.307 --> 00:19:52.308]  About 10 miles north of that on 183, there's a
[00:19:53.723 --> 00:19:55.404]  Shooting range on the right called Stands.
[00:19:57.105 --> 00:20:00.806]  Right next to it, from what I understand, my brother and my friend's been out there.
[00:20:01.287 --> 00:20:07.990]  I've got two pictures of it and from their eyewitness account it looks like what we've seen from other FEMA locations that you've given us info on.
[00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.131]  What's there?
[00:20:12.112 --> 00:20:15.353]  There's portables, there's a chain link gate around it.
[00:20:16.314 --> 00:20:19.655]  There's some heavy security doors on the portables.
[00:20:20.395 --> 00:20:21.236]  Like I said, I've got two
[00:20:21.815 --> 00:20:23.016]  Camera phone pictures.
[00:20:23.036 --> 00:20:28.401]  I haven't been out there myself, but there's a whole lot of portables, a big row.
[00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:31.904]  Well, let me tell you publicly where the FEMA camps are.
[00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:39.271]  Out at the old Robert Mueller Airport, the police admit there's a continued government hangar with bolts and chains and port-a-potties just waiting.
[00:20:39.992 --> 00:20:41.473]  They have these in any major city.
[00:20:41.754 --> 00:20:45.697]  The threat fusion centers are federalizing the cities right now.
[00:20:46.738 --> 00:20:47.758]  So that's going on.
[00:20:48.679 --> 00:20:55.441]  And you also, of course, have one of the old malls out off of I-35.
[00:20:55.461 --> 00:20:57.502]  Pardon me, guys?
[00:20:58.382 --> 00:20:59.202]  Yeah, Highland Mall.
[00:21:00.162 --> 00:21:02.263]  Jaron can tell I was searching for the name.
[00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:04.484]  Sometimes the most obvious stuff escapes me.
[00:21:05.084 --> 00:21:07.665]  Yeah, FEMA has taken over part of that mall.
[00:21:08.525 --> 00:21:11.728]  One of the things that I noticed that was notable when I looked at the info to give you
[00:21:36.198 --> 00:21:49.447]  On, uh, try to get the latest satellite feed picture of the area, I noticed on the Terra server, the most common one that's, uh, almost updated, it looks like it's been blanked out, like you see some government sites where they... Well, that's very suspicious.
[00:21:49.487 --> 00:21:49.987]  Stay there.
[00:21:51.048 --> 00:21:51.949]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.429 --> 00:21:54.050]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.971 --> 00:21:57.652]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:00.427 --> 00:22:04.250]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[00:22:48.029 --> 00:23:02.276]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:23:02.296 --> 00:23:04.557]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:23:04.657 --> 00:23:07.398]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:23:07.859 --> 00:23:12.621]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:23:12.961 --> 00:23:17.163]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:23:17.483 --> 00:23:19.805]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:23:19.825 --> 00:23:22.346]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:23:22.706 --> 00:23:25.268]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:23:25.608 --> 00:23:33.213]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:38.833]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:23:38.953 --> 00:23:41.234]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:23:41.794 --> 00:23:45.236]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:23:45.476 --> 00:23:46.397]  And I got news for you.
[00:23:46.557 --> 00:23:47.878]  You're everyone else.
[00:23:47.898 --> 00:23:48.898]  Invisible Empire.

[00:24:52.292 --> 00:24:53.072]  Thank you!
[00:25:09.789 --> 00:25:15.913]  Alright, look.
[00:25:16.313 --> 00:25:17.634]  I got a bunch of news I want to get to.
[00:25:17.654 --> 00:25:18.995]  We covered some of it in the first hour.
[00:25:20.176 --> 00:25:22.657]  We got guests coming up with reports from the G20 as well.
[00:25:22.697 --> 00:25:25.980]  But I wanted Eric to be able to finish up.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.080]  That is suspicious.
[00:25:28.061 --> 00:25:35.266]  If you think an area looks like a FEMA facility and then on top of it, it's blacked out by satellite, finish up your point.
[00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:47.052]  Yeah, if you look on the Terra server website, like I was saying, the image actually is a little old, but it looks very obvious that it was blanked out, like, you know, Microsoft Paint kind of application.
[00:25:47.532 --> 00:25:50.373]  Same as you see on other government sites, that they'll do that sensitive areas.
[00:25:52.093 --> 00:26:00.815]  Besides that, I was just going to say that I've got, passing on the info that you're putting out, I've got two of my sons that are passing on the word to their friends as well.
[00:26:01.475 --> 00:26:03.736]  They're young ones, but they're waking up as well.
[00:26:05.111 --> 00:26:17.438]  Well, God bless you, and we've got a lot of great men and women out there, a lot of people better than I, who are taking action now, and I'm humbled and honored to know there's so many great people out there who are standing up against this new world order.
[00:26:19.399 --> 00:26:21.020]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.901]  Let's talk to Jim in Missouri.
[00:26:22.962 --> 00:26:23.722]  Jim, you're on the air.
[00:26:23.742 --> 00:26:25.743]  Hey, Alex.
[00:26:26.063 --> 00:26:26.283]  Jim.
[00:26:26.584 --> 00:26:26.884]  Hey, buddy.
[00:26:26.904 --> 00:26:27.024]  St.
[00:26:27.044 --> 00:26:27.284]  Louis.
[00:26:28.285 --> 00:26:33.848]  I called you, I don't know, a couple months ago about the HTH buckets, which you are aware of.
[00:26:34.838 --> 00:26:41.266]  And I am aware of since we have family members that are part of the wonderful water company.
[00:26:43.929 --> 00:26:44.610]  Here in St.
[00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.312]  Louis, they're known as American water.
[00:26:47.093 --> 00:26:48.675]  They're not American whatsoever.
[00:26:48.955 --> 00:26:53.861]  So on that front, you know, people just need to realize that
[00:26:54.961 --> 00:26:58.383]  If you dump a bunch of HTH in a pool, you're not supposed to go in a pool.
[00:26:58.443 --> 00:26:59.583]  So why are you going to drink it?
[00:27:00.063 --> 00:27:09.027]  Well, for those that just joined us, I have some cousins in East Texas who I've sat around having dinner with, and they talk about how, yeah, sodium fluoride's bug poison.
[00:27:09.047 --> 00:27:12.689]  You can put less than a teaspoon on a fire ant bed, it kills them.
[00:27:13.289 --> 00:27:18.271]  We've got the best water coming out of an aquifer here, but the feds make us put this stuff in there.
[00:27:18.331 --> 00:27:19.131]  It's from China.
[00:27:19.512 --> 00:27:20.692]  It's full of other poisons.
[00:27:20.712 --> 00:27:22.373]  We have all these newscasts where they report
[00:27:23.598 --> 00:27:26.800]  The same thing, not just the fluoride, but all these other chemicals.
[00:27:27.741 --> 00:27:31.083]  And... ...was a chemical operator.
[00:27:31.163 --> 00:27:33.304]  He retired, but he doesn't even drink the water.
[00:27:33.364 --> 00:27:34.705]  So that should tell you something.
[00:27:34.845 --> 00:27:38.927]  If the chemical operators won't drink the water, there's a problem with it.
[00:27:39.968 --> 00:27:41.389]  But that's not why I'm calling you.
[00:27:41.409 --> 00:27:50.975]  The reason why I'm calling you is we need to think outside the box, and it's getting to that point where, you know, everything's getting to be oppressed.
[00:27:52.436 --> 00:27:55.037]  As an example, uh, free speech zones.
[00:27:55.757 --> 00:27:56.157]  Okay.
[00:27:56.697 --> 00:27:59.658]  You want to play free speech zones games, we can play that too.
[00:28:00.918 --> 00:28:04.219]  Start showing up to your, uh, protests.
[00:28:04.839 --> 00:28:08.040]  Turn your back to the individuals you're protesting.
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.500]  Don't say a word.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.420]  You don't have to worry about a free speech zone.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.401]  Pretty simple.
[00:28:12.581 --> 00:28:15.101]  They start acting up against you and pushing you around.
[00:28:15.621 --> 00:28:17.042]  You have a right to defend yourself.
[00:28:17.542 --> 00:28:18.242]  It's pretty simple.
[00:28:20.095 --> 00:28:29.884]  Uh, as far as, I drive around with an Info Wars sticker on the back of my truck and it has a inside, 9-11 inside job.
[00:28:30.624 --> 00:28:35.408]  You would not believe how many police officers, they come up to me and they don't pull me over.
[00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:47.619]  They, they kind of, you know, hide in the shadows and then when I pull over like to Home Depot or whatever, they literally get out of their car and come talk to me.
[00:28:48.829 --> 00:28:56.095]  And it's great, you know, because I'd say 80% of them are right along with what you say.
[00:28:56.115 --> 00:28:58.376]  I mean, they're very much aware of it.
[00:28:58.817 --> 00:29:05.461]  But what I find interesting is they get out of their car, they get away from their car, and then they come talk to me.
[00:29:05.782 --> 00:29:09.765]  They don't do it in front of the car like, you know, like if I was getting pulled over or something.
[00:29:10.345 --> 00:29:13.547]  Well, that's wonderful news, and I appreciate your call, Jim.
[00:29:14.588 --> 00:29:15.249]  I will say this.
[00:29:18.127 --> 00:29:20.668]  I learn new things all the time.
[00:29:22.108 --> 00:29:26.590]  The old adage is, the more wisdom you have, the more you know you don't know.
[00:29:29.231 --> 00:29:31.151]  And I will state it again as I did last hour.
[00:29:31.491 --> 00:29:39.054]  I more and more realize the mistakes I've made in decade plus, going back to 15 years that I've been on the radio.
[00:29:41.690 --> 00:30:01.372]  And one of the biggest ones is just out of hand at a primitive level seeing police as the representatives of the suppressing system and beating a, not a war drum, but a anger drum at the police.
[00:30:03.991 --> 00:30:22.838]  And then what that does is, that makes the police compact more into their little cult system, and then they start pulling away from the public, the public sees that change in attitude, we pull more away from them, and then the system, the feds, the globalists, they get what they want.
[00:30:23.778 --> 00:30:29.620]  A bunch of compartmentalized citizens and police, who happen to be citizens as well,
[00:30:31.215 --> 00:30:41.812]  And yes, I have been blown away by how much information police give me, how many police come over and shake my hand who are listeners, even though sometimes the show comes off as if
[00:30:43.496 --> 00:30:44.537]  I don't know.
[00:31:02.771 --> 00:31:04.412]  And I always oversimplify.
[00:31:05.153 --> 00:31:13.678]  When you go research what I'm saying, you're going to find out in almost every case, it's light years worse than I can even explain to people.
[00:31:14.999 --> 00:31:19.282]  So much of the time now, I am so frustrated by this, and so sick of it.
[00:31:21.083 --> 00:31:22.724]  And there seems like there's no way to get out of it.
[00:31:22.804 --> 00:31:24.606]  And it just gets more and more crazy.
[00:31:25.266 --> 00:31:27.668]  But then I understand that's a psychological tactic.
[00:31:28.587 --> 00:31:41.772]  It's a psychological tactic of the establishment to act crazy, to act wild, to act over-the-top, to act domineering and absurd so that we just kind of get overwhelmed and get conditioned to accept anything.
[00:31:41.872 --> 00:31:42.093]  No!
[00:31:42.673 --> 00:31:45.714]  I'm not accepting tyranny anymore.
[00:31:46.194 --> 00:31:46.594]  I'm done.
[00:31:47.575 --> 00:31:48.015]  I'm done.
[00:31:49.055 --> 00:31:51.556]  And I'm going to be bold and I'm going to tell it like it is.
[00:31:52.097 --> 00:31:54.818]  And truth is greater than lies.
[00:31:57.506 --> 00:31:59.247]  The pen is mightier than the sword.
[00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:06.912]  If you will simply take action and warn and inform people about what's going down and what's happening, there's no way they're going to succeed.
[00:32:06.952 --> 00:32:13.776]  That's why they're rushing to shut down the internet right now and finally, openly sending up trial balloons to sell you on it.
[00:32:14.396 --> 00:32:17.318]  And moving ahead with the control grid they've already built to do it.
[00:32:17.998 --> 00:32:20.480]  Under cyber security three years ago, it's already in place.
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.542]  They're now just trying to get the laws in place to authorize it.
[00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:28.792]  And they will launch false flags on the web as the pretext to take control of it.
[00:32:29.433 --> 00:32:30.774]  And they won't shut it down overnight.
[00:32:30.794 --> 00:32:37.660]  They'll say, oh, we just shut it down for a few days to protect it and to save it.
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.142]  And then, see, we turned it back on.
[00:32:41.914 --> 00:32:47.420]  And then people say, well, see, the government, those of you that complained about it, the government saved the Internet.
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.362]  I mean, I know how their brains work, and so that's all coming.
[00:32:50.723 --> 00:32:51.704]  That's all going to happen.
[00:32:51.884 --> 00:32:55.648]  In fact, let me cover a few of these news items, and then we're going to go back to your calls here.
[00:32:56.288 --> 00:32:58.971]  Here's an article that's the top story on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:32:59.411 --> 00:33:01.333]  This just came out in the last hour.
[00:33:01.754 --> 00:33:05.558]  Cybersecurity measures will mandate government ID tokens to use the Internet.
[00:33:06.098 --> 00:33:22.892]  The move to shut down and regulate the internet under a new governmental control system has accelerated into high gear with an announcement that the government cyber security strategy revolves around issuing internet users with ID tokens without which they will not be able to visit websites.
[00:33:22.952 --> 00:33:31.258]  The latest salvo against web freedom which in combination with Senator Joe Lieberman's kill switch bill will serve to eviscerate the free internet as we know it.
[00:33:31.779 --> 00:33:34.101]  Under the guise of cyber security the government is moving to
[00:33:36.089 --> 00:34:01.624]  discredit and shut down of the existing internet infrastructure in pursuit of a new centralized regulated worldwide web and we have links to all their claims all their statements how they're openly have already hired armies of paid disinformation agents on the web the pentagon the the state department that tyrell ventura sent me a text message the other day and said have you seen this and
[00:34:03.333 --> 00:34:05.514]  I had seen it, but I'd never covered it.
[00:34:05.874 --> 00:34:13.076]  So before I forget, I'm going to go to Tyrell's text message here, but don't show the phone because it's got his phone number on here.
[00:34:13.836 --> 00:34:15.317]  And I'm going to click on this.
[00:34:16.797 --> 00:34:20.138]  It's America.gov conspiracy theories HTML.
[00:34:20.898 --> 00:34:23.999]  Here, Jaren, I'm just going to give you my iPhone with this page pulled up.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.220]  And I want to pull this up on screen for people.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.061]  Thanks a lot.
[00:34:32.028 --> 00:34:39.815]  But yes, I was aware of it, but I'm glad somebody reminded me of it, because so much of what I see and read and study, I never even end up getting to.
[00:34:39.835 --> 00:34:46.642]  I mean, that's why I keep saying over and over again, I'm frustrated, because people are thinking I'm making stuff up or exaggerating.
[00:34:46.982 --> 00:34:48.384]  It's the opposite, okay?
[00:34:48.404 --> 00:34:53.929]  I mean, you've got to research this for yourself, is what I'm trying to say.
[00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:56.531]  In the movie The Matrix,
[00:34:59.181 --> 00:35:04.126]  Morpheus tells Neo, look I can't tell you what the Matrix is, you gotta see it for yourself.
[00:35:05.167 --> 00:35:08.249]  But it's the world that's pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
[00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:09.871]  But you're a slave, Neo.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.541]  And of course, we're not really in a Matrix like that, we're more in a Truman Show.
[00:35:17.321 --> 00:35:35.705]  But the Pentagon says 30 years ago they want to build a Matrix, and the Pentagon describes in a declassified report from the 70s, declassified in January of 2000... See, I don't even want to say this on air, because it's an actual Army report, but people wouldn't believe it.
[00:35:36.772 --> 00:35:40.174]  They say they want to put you in tanks like in the Matrix movie and that will be peace.
[00:35:40.294 --> 00:35:48.019]  Global peace is everyone in tanks with wires hooked into their heads in a new virtual reality with the ruling elite above us and they're going to use it as an energy source.
[00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:51.301]  I mean, the movie Matrix is just throwing in your face what they plan.
[00:35:51.601 --> 00:36:04.229]  And the average person watches TV, plays with video games all day, all they do is sit there and watch television, your eyes actually interfacing with it, which of course the sight centers are in the back of the brain so they're figuratively jacking you in.
[00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:14.353]  And you're being inserted into the Matrix right now and all these top futurists and scientists and Ray Kurzweil say within 10 years if you want a job you'll have to have the brain chip.
[00:36:14.713 --> 00:36:27.878]  They already make the Mexican Attorney General's employees taking plantable chips and whether they're going to be able to do it or not, the point is the Pentagon and people are theorizing about these type of things and the type of world they want to build because there will be no more war.
[00:36:27.918 --> 00:36:31.059]  There will only be peace when you're all prisoners of the Matrix.
[00:36:32.995 --> 00:36:33.475]  There it is.
[00:36:34.196 --> 00:36:35.636]  America.gov.
[00:36:36.897 --> 00:36:38.578]  And after all, you can't be against America.
[00:36:38.638 --> 00:36:41.099]  Conspiracy theories and misinformation.
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:46.102]  And they tell you that all vaccines are good for you and there's never a problem, even though it's on the news every day.
[00:36:46.142 --> 00:36:46.842]  It's killing people.
[00:36:46.922 --> 00:36:51.505]  And they tell you that September 11th wasn't an inside job.
[00:36:53.446 --> 00:36:56.327]  And they tell you it's a misconception that the U.S.
[00:36:56.347 --> 00:36:57.188]  doesn't like Islam.
[00:36:58.595 --> 00:37:01.617]  And they tell you it's a misconception that the bankers are ripping you off.
[00:37:01.657 --> 00:37:03.137]  You know, Madoff really is a good guy.
[00:37:04.938 --> 00:37:07.580]  And this is an official propaganda channel.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:12.883]  And imagine, we've got the Pentagon openly saying that
[00:37:14.503 --> 00:37:28.861]  I mean, I watched Clark, in testimony from last week, say, the head of cyber security of CyberCom, say that we are the four branches of the military, we are operating domestically, and we are taking over the internet to protect it.
[00:37:30.199 --> 00:37:37.006]  Kind of like the Mafia is going to, oh why don't you put my cousin Luigi in your grocery store and then there won't be any fires.
[00:37:37.727 --> 00:37:40.910]  Because that's how you pay for the insurance, you'll look out for fires.
[00:37:41.471 --> 00:37:47.317]  But if you don't give him a full time job, he won't be here, but you'll send him the money once a week, he'll drop by and get it.
[00:37:48.138 --> 00:37:51.279]  If you don't do that, there's going to be a fire.
[00:37:51.939 --> 00:38:02.361]  If you don't let us run the Internet and shut it off and get rid of those conspiracy theorists, there's going to be a little fire and the Internet's going to get destroyed by the Chinese that we're in business with.
[00:38:03.622 --> 00:38:06.602]  And so you need to let us run things now.
[00:38:08.043 --> 00:38:12.784]  You need to let us run things now or there's going to be a big, big problem out there.
[00:38:12.824 --> 00:38:13.764]  You understand that?
[00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:16.591]  And so we're going to take over the internet now.
[00:38:16.631 --> 00:38:17.991]  We're going to watch what you watch.
[00:38:18.271 --> 00:38:19.792]  We need to keep an eye on you.
[00:38:20.532 --> 00:38:21.113]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:21.533 --> 00:38:23.634]  Going to be watching everything you do.
[00:38:23.714 --> 00:38:26.235]  Big Sister Kagan going to be up there.
[00:38:26.895 --> 00:38:28.035]  Going to be watching you.
[00:38:29.136 --> 00:38:32.877]  After all, the Supreme Court says we can disappear your speech.
[00:38:33.477 --> 00:38:36.659]  And we got legislation introduced to disappear you physically.
[00:38:37.099 --> 00:38:38.379]  Like Jimmy Hoffa.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:39.740]  That's freedom.
[00:38:44.676 --> 00:38:46.657]  Land of the slave, home of the cowards.
[00:38:47.438 --> 00:38:51.841]  And I'm not making fun of folks with their great Yankee accents, and you know I do make fun of the good old boys too.
[00:38:52.642 --> 00:38:54.263]  I could do a boss hog for you right now.
[00:38:57.045 --> 00:38:57.465]  Literally.
[00:38:58.906 --> 00:39:07.813]  This is our town, we've been running it for nine generations, and we don't let little people get uppity around here, take whoever's property we want.
[00:39:08.905 --> 00:39:15.168]  We run the drugs through this area, but when we catch them young doper kids using it, we also throw them in the jail.
[00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:22.091]  There's a lot of opportunities to work with the government.
[00:39:22.151 --> 00:39:23.212]  I like Obama.
[00:39:23.972 --> 00:39:25.193]  I've heard him talk like that.
[00:39:27.174 --> 00:39:27.594]  Oh God.
[00:39:28.956 --> 00:39:30.077]  But, uh, you can read about it.
[00:39:31.158 --> 00:39:34.642]  IDs to use the internet, meaning they're tracking everything you do and surveilling you.
[00:39:35.362 --> 00:39:36.964]  Filters controlling what you can see.
[00:39:37.284 --> 00:39:43.250]  The government, this is in the cybersecurity bill, it's passed the House, passed the Senate committee, it's pretty much a sure thing vote now.
[00:39:45.553 --> 00:39:49.657]  Though little, little Hitler bird is now dead, but I'm sure whoever they replace him with, uh...
[00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:52.436]  They need all those votes they can get.
[00:39:52.916 --> 00:39:55.397]  Obama internet kill switch plan approved by the Senate.
[00:39:55.758 --> 00:39:56.498]  That's tech world.
[00:39:56.838 --> 00:39:59.500]  Here's our story up for two and a half days at Drugs Report.
[00:40:01.781 --> 00:40:02.901]  It's been up since Saturday.
[00:40:03.222 --> 00:40:05.303]  I saw it Sunday, but it's been up since Saturday, I've been told.
[00:40:05.683 --> 00:40:09.405]  Obama can shut down internet for four months under new emergency powers.
[00:40:09.885 --> 00:40:11.526]  You might want to actually go read this.
[00:40:11.546 --> 00:40:13.387]  We have the quotes out of the bill itself.
[00:40:16.249 --> 00:40:19.771]  And even though this is all over the news and admitted, it's like, well, that's just the way it is.
[00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:24.323]  You know, we've got to do that.
[00:40:24.383 --> 00:40:25.504]  We've got to do that right now.
[00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:30.307]  But hey, the Supreme Court gave us our gun rights.
[00:40:30.347 --> 00:40:30.788]  No, they didn't.
[00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:35.251]  They said counties and cities can restrict your Second Amendment, just not completely.
[00:40:36.021 --> 00:40:44.563]  They never had that fake authority before, but now one of the kangaroo branches of government has said that states and cities can restrict your Second Amendment.
[00:40:44.903 --> 00:40:47.624]  States can't restrict anything under the Bill of Rights.
[00:40:48.504 --> 00:40:51.565]  And the minute they try, that's when the federal power comes in.
[00:40:51.765 --> 00:40:53.065]  It's a separation of powers.
[00:40:53.105 --> 00:40:55.706]  The states aren't too powerful, the feds aren't too powerful.
[00:40:55.966 --> 00:40:57.186]  And it's always that balance.
[00:40:57.586 --> 00:41:01.007]  And so the establishment's like, we kind of like states' rights.
[00:41:01.147 --> 00:41:01.507]  Yeah.
[00:41:01.927 --> 00:41:03.948]  States' rights says you hand your gun in.
[00:41:05.513 --> 00:41:06.478]  That's what the ruling says.
[00:41:06.498 --> 00:41:06.539]  Oh!
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:14.622]  This doesn't mean the Chicago gun ban can still not be in place, it just means that you've got to modify it a bit, all right?
[00:41:14.662 --> 00:41:16.823]  Don't worry, you'll still get their guns, Alito said.
[00:41:16.843 --> 00:41:17.763]  They said, oh!
[00:41:18.103 --> 00:41:20.924]  And so that's why the gun control groups are very excited right now.
[00:41:20.944 --> 00:41:24.365]  They're like, don't worry, we're going to get these people.
[00:41:24.685 --> 00:41:26.605]  We've got them where we want them, all right?
[00:41:26.845 --> 00:41:27.606]  They're chumps.
[00:41:27.666 --> 00:41:29.226]  This is meant to make them go to sleep.
[00:41:29.886 --> 00:41:31.547]  Now we commence with getting their guns.
[00:41:32.907 --> 00:41:35.268]  There's nothing these dumb Americans won't buy.
[00:41:37.176 --> 00:41:38.498]  Ha ha ha!
[00:41:38.858 --> 00:41:47.389]  And as long as we can shut that Alex Jones down and that pesky Drudge Report and those other evil talk show hosts, everything will be just fine.
[00:41:47.409 --> 00:41:48.470]  We're so close.
[00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:49.812]  Let's just keep working.
[00:41:49.832 --> 00:41:51.254]  Let's just keep working.
[00:41:51.274 --> 00:41:54.858]  Before I go to break, come back with some more of your calls and more news.
[00:41:54.978 --> 00:41:56.000]  And we're going to go to Ottawa.
[00:41:57.332 --> 00:41:59.913]  We're going to go to Toronto and other areas to see what the G20 is up to.

[00:44:05.105 --> 00:44:06.006]  Tyranny is here.
[00:44:06.366 --> 00:44:10.067]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:44:10.087 --> 00:44:12.508]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:44:12.528 --> 00:44:17.970]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:24.613]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:44:25.073 --> 00:44:30.596]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[00:44:45.443 --> 00:44:48.524]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:44:48.985 --> 00:44:50.425]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:44:50.966 --> 00:44:51.406]  It's here.

[00:45:00.803 --> 00:45:03.968]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[00:45:04.528 --> 00:45:05.108]  Think again.
[00:45:05.868 --> 00:45:13.330]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:20.471]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[00:45:20.731 --> 00:45:28.973]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf cleanup.

[00:46:07.042 --> 00:46:13.888]  Yep, Elena Kagan, butchering the Bill of Rights, serial offender, going after our basic liberties and freedoms.
[00:46:13.948 --> 00:46:23.077]  But hey, four members of the Supreme Court argued for an absolute Chicago gun ban nationwide.
[00:46:23.557 --> 00:46:26.940]  They argued that there is no right for you to own a single-shot .22 rifle.
[00:46:29.258 --> 00:46:30.219]  Four members.
[00:46:31.159 --> 00:46:39.464]  We've had a government that criminal that they put monsters on the bench who lied in their confirmations saying they believed in the Second Amendment.
[00:46:42.426 --> 00:46:47.609]  So Kagan is just replacing, uh, you know, one of the other droppings.
[00:46:49.468 --> 00:46:52.391]  But she is as bad or worse than anything I've ever seen.
[00:46:52.451 --> 00:46:53.211]  I mean, she is bold.
[00:46:53.552 --> 00:46:55.613]  At least the others have been federal or state judges.
[00:46:55.633 --> 00:47:00.818]  I mean, this woman's never been a judge, never been a trial lawyer, but she's a Goldman Sachs former operative.
[00:47:00.838 --> 00:47:03.981]  Isn't that just special?
[00:47:05.102 --> 00:47:14.370]  And so now, up on PrisonPlanet.tv for viewers, we have the John Wayne Kagan-Gacy clown look-alike.
[00:47:16.308 --> 00:47:19.530]  And I'm telling you, she looks just like John Wayne Gacy in those photos with the big jowl.
[00:47:20.131 --> 00:47:24.434]  And I had that idea in my mind, so a listener, Steve, put this together.
[00:47:24.814 --> 00:47:27.296]  And wait a minute, Phil is an awesome graphics guy.
[00:47:27.316 --> 00:47:28.157]  Phil, where's yours?
[00:47:29.538 --> 00:47:33.480]  You made one, but she's so beautiful you can't look at her anymore?
[00:47:35.122 --> 00:47:38.144]  And I'm someone that doesn't really put a lot of stock in what someone looks like.
[00:47:39.493 --> 00:47:45.275]  I don't normally talk about the cover of a book, but I mean, today, can we find an image of her from the hearings?
[00:47:45.575 --> 00:47:46.275]  Are they still going?
[00:47:46.555 --> 00:47:50.336]  I mean, she's wearing this Byzantine Queen Elizabeth giant outfit.
[00:47:50.356 --> 00:47:51.756]  Her hands look bigger than her head.
[00:47:51.776 --> 00:47:58.458]  It's like in Beetlejuice, she has this tiny head, and she's like a...
[00:48:00.154 --> 00:48:03.698]  Grimer Wormwood or something from Lord of the Rings when he's hiding behind the throne.
[00:48:03.878 --> 00:48:04.859]  Your majesty don't listen.
[00:48:07.402 --> 00:48:12.106]  I mean she's literally like in there in the in the meeting.
[00:48:12.126 --> 00:48:14.329]  I mean what a troll like ugly creature.
[00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:17.352]  And look I've noticed all the photos of her in the past.
[00:48:18.012 --> 00:48:20.395]  She's not wearing makeup and jewels and that's fine.
[00:48:21.616 --> 00:48:23.177]  That's fine if she's androgynous.
[00:48:23.217 --> 00:48:26.559]  The issue here is, is that why are they dressing her up like a woman?
[00:48:26.879 --> 00:48:33.604]  And since dressing her up like a woman is not fair to her style, I really looked at her soul, her spirit, and saw a clown.
[00:48:34.264 --> 00:48:36.005]  But not a happy, friendly clown, no.
[00:48:37.766 --> 00:48:38.907]  A dangerous clown.
[00:48:39.688 --> 00:48:41.028]  Clown of our nightmares.
[00:48:41.409 --> 00:48:45.851]  And so I dub her... John Wayne Kagan Gacy.
[00:48:47.012 --> 00:48:48.013]  Our Supreme Leader.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.506]  Butcher of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:48:53.031 --> 00:48:54.937]  Vice-demon of the New World Order.
[00:48:56.115 --> 00:49:00.858]  Supreme Defender of Corruption and Lack of Due Process and Victim Disarmament.
[00:49:01.679 --> 00:49:05.381]  Oh, Great Supreme Kagan, you are so wonderful.
[00:49:05.461 --> 00:49:11.665]  You are so really big and gracious and wondrous.
[00:49:11.685 --> 00:49:13.266]  You will disappear our speech.
[00:49:13.626 --> 00:49:14.927]  You support torture.
[00:49:15.247 --> 00:49:16.868]  You will disappear our liberties.
[00:49:17.529 --> 00:49:19.330]  Oh, thank you, Lord Kagan.
[00:49:21.288 --> 00:49:24.589]  Alright, I'm going to come back and we'll take some calls in the next little segment.
[00:49:24.609 --> 00:49:28.070]  Then we've got some guests coming on for much of the next hour, but some more news.
[00:49:30.631 --> 00:49:33.632]  I'm really almost scared to read the rest of this news to you here.
[00:49:34.072 --> 00:49:38.394]  It's all up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but some of it
[00:49:39.451 --> 00:49:40.272]  Deals with the spill.
[00:49:41.012 --> 00:49:42.974]  And mainstream news saying we're going into a depression.
[00:49:43.614 --> 00:49:46.437]  And more media talking about evacuations.
[00:49:46.477 --> 00:49:48.258]  Here's the Christian Science Monitor.
[00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:49.579]  Gulf oil spill.
[00:49:49.619 --> 00:49:52.782]  Could toxic storm make beach towns uninhabitable?
[00:49:54.583 --> 00:49:58.366]  So they're talking about evacuations in the Washington Post as well.
[00:49:58.606 --> 00:50:01.989]  Oil Industry Insider says CFR member predicts Gulf evacuation.
[00:50:02.009 --> 00:50:04.131]  So we'll talk about that some too.
[00:50:04.791 --> 00:50:07.153]  I did have one more sponsor in the cellar I wanted to tell you about.
[00:50:07.173 --> 00:50:08.975]  This is one I want you to listen up on particularly.
[00:50:10.202 --> 00:50:17.547]  It's one thing to own firearms to protect yourself from street criminals and criminals in other places, but it's another thing to actually know how to use them.
[00:50:17.667 --> 00:50:26.113]  And the best, I heard about these people a decade ago, FrontSight.com, the best private, non-tough guy, firearms training, handguns, rifles, shotguns, you name it.
[00:50:27.654 --> 00:50:30.456]  It just scares the parasites to death to know your arm, know how to use it.
[00:50:30.856 --> 00:50:35.059]  FrontSight.com, get a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:38.101]  Find out more at FrontSight.com, like the front of your pistol.
[00:50:38.341 --> 00:50:39.862]  FrontSight.com, stay with us.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.607]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:45.149 --> 00:50:48.300]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:50.225 --> 00:50:55.087]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:50:55.188 --> 00:50:55.968]  What have we got?
[00:50:56.208 --> 00:50:58.329]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:50:58.629 --> 00:50:59.370]  A republic.
[00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:02.211]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:51:02.291 --> 00:51:04.192]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:51:04.552 --> 00:51:06.453]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:51:06.573 --> 00:51:07.854]  So they think they own our land?
[00:51:08.254 --> 00:51:09.375]  They think they own our water?
[00:51:09.575 --> 00:51:09.975]  Children?
[00:51:10.195 --> 00:51:10.975]  Our education?
[00:51:11.296 --> 00:51:11.916]  Our money?
[00:51:12.136 --> 00:51:15.798]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:51:16.158 --> 00:51:20.805]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:51:21.125 --> 00:51:21.946]  We have the facts.
[00:51:22.146 --> 00:51:23.248]  We have the Constitution.
[00:51:23.328 --> 00:51:24.189]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:51:24.209 --> 00:51:25.050]  We have common law.
[00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:27.353]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:27.634 --> 00:51:31.399]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:51:31.499 --> 00:51:36.302]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:51:36.462 --> 00:51:37.843]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:51:37.963 --> 00:51:38.804]  Don't tread on me.
[00:51:39.044 --> 00:51:49.571]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:51:53.514 --> 00:51:55.415]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:55.876 --> 00:51:58.678]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:11.266 --> 00:52:19.151]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a special report when we go into the next segment on what's happening at the G20, and it's very serious.
[00:52:19.632 --> 00:52:22.173]  But first, we've got a little mini-report on Elena Kagan.
[00:52:22.954 --> 00:52:25.375]  It'll just take a few minutes coming up after the break.
[00:52:26.116 --> 00:52:29.098]  But right now, let's continue with your phone calls today.
[00:52:29.698 --> 00:52:31.579]  Mike in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:32.040]  Go ahead.
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.501]  Alex.
[00:52:34.902 --> 00:52:35.462]  Yes, sir.
[00:52:35.622 --> 00:52:35.882]  Mike.
[00:52:37.143 --> 00:52:37.403]  Hey.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:41.401]  My favorite author is Jim Mars.
[00:52:41.782 --> 00:52:44.044]  My favorite book is Ruled by Secrecy.
[00:52:45.405 --> 00:53:00.116]  And I don't have it handy, but one of his big points was Sam and Chase running around and looking at state versus state military.
[00:53:00.136 --> 00:53:04.199]  Well, I'm not really following you.
[00:53:04.239 --> 00:53:06.321]  Can you elaborate on exactly what you're talking about?
[00:53:08.102 --> 00:53:09.203]  Well, he's talking about
[00:53:10.393 --> 00:53:11.173]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[00:53:11.193 --> 00:53:12.313]  Hey, how's it going man?
[00:53:31.341 --> 00:53:34.223]  I got two things I was meaning to tell you guys about.
[00:53:34.323 --> 00:53:35.964]  I'm a first-time caller, I'm a little nervous.
[00:53:36.144 --> 00:53:36.504]  Welcome!
[00:53:37.605 --> 00:53:38.025]  Thank you.
[00:53:38.045 --> 00:53:42.368]  Yeah, I was up at the CBS, the local CBS.
[00:53:42.428 --> 00:53:57.217]  I live in a suburb here in Kansas City called Independence and we were, I was in there buying my allergy medicine and I just happened to hear the pharmaceutical rep talking to the head of the pharmacy and they were just like casually like laughing about this but they said
[00:53:58.001 --> 00:54:04.672]  They were gonna start, uh, the pharmaceutical companies were gonna start putting, uh, statins in the water, as well as lithium.
[00:54:04.772 --> 00:54:06.294]  And they were just, you know, yucking it up.
[00:54:06.354 --> 00:54:07.556]  Ha ha ha, so funny.
[00:54:08.882 --> 00:54:23.154]  Well, no, that's being proposed on the news and of all groups, the Department of Agriculture is looking at putting lithium and statins, because after all, you're going to be happier and the police may have to come by and test your blood.
[00:54:23.354 --> 00:54:32.581]  Oh, like in THX 1138, where you avoiding, you know, your drug dose evasion, because that's a serious crime.
[00:54:33.302 --> 00:54:37.005]  And, oh, yes, you need your statins, which fry your liver.
[00:54:37.665 --> 00:54:39.707]  And of course, the studies show are a complete fraud.
[00:54:40.147 --> 00:54:47.352]  And as the studies come out that the statins are a fraud in almost all cases, they push even more to now make children take statins.
[00:54:47.372 --> 00:54:49.534]  That's now been on the news, perhaps at age five.
[00:54:49.554 --> 00:54:51.115]  I mean, it's the law.
[00:54:51.195 --> 00:54:54.757]  Everyone must take all these drugs that Big Pharma says we must take.
[00:54:54.797 --> 00:54:57.639]  So you were in there and heard them snickering and giggling.
[00:54:57.659 --> 00:54:58.340]  Did you talk to them?
[00:55:00.147 --> 00:55:05.670]  I tried to confront one of them about it, and he kind of turned his back, like, you know, don't talk to me, jerk, or something, basically.
[00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:09.312]  Oh, because he's got a special white lab coat, and again, he's on a power trip.
[00:55:09.352 --> 00:55:10.412]  You're just a slave.
[00:55:10.672 --> 00:55:12.093]  He's part of the drug guild.
[00:55:12.493 --> 00:55:17.056]  He's part of the elite drug guild, and you dare to try to speak to him, you ramble.
[00:55:19.297 --> 00:55:20.078]  Yeah, pretty much.
[00:55:20.658 --> 00:55:22.179]  I also want to make another point.
[00:55:22.339 --> 00:55:24.220]  I'm a student filmmaker here in Kansas City.
[00:55:25.007 --> 00:55:29.728]  And, uh, I was helping a friend of mine, uh, do a, uh, film on the healthcare bill.
[00:55:30.668 --> 00:55:37.309]  And it was kind of strange because my, the head of my department is, like, diehard Obamanoid.
[00:55:37.869 --> 00:55:40.390]  I mean, totally buys the garbage.
[00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:45.631]  And I had a bunch of the points that were actually in PDF up behind me.
[00:55:45.711 --> 00:55:53.392]  And I was making some of the points about, uh, how the illegals wouldn't have to pay any, any of the taxes and the, and the healthcare would be rationed.
[00:55:54.370 --> 00:56:00.738]  And, uh, she turned and looked at me right after the, uh, final presentation of the documentary and she said, well, that's a good propaganda piece.
[00:56:02.682 --> 00:56:05.865]  I mean, I just kind of looked at her like, what are you on?
[00:56:06.406 --> 00:56:09.629]  Well, you remember Missouri when he was running for office.
[00:56:09.669 --> 00:56:24.063]  I mean, I'd heard the rumors in Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Vermont of all places, where they do have a pretty well-informed public and pretty good laws in place, very close to our founding father's vision in Vermont.
[00:56:24.824 --> 00:56:38.248]  I'd heard the rumors and seen a few news articles, but then I saw the police chiefs and prosecutors on TV in your city saying, if you talk bad about Obama, that's illegal, you will not lie about him and say he's a Muslim, we will come arrest you.
[00:56:39.188 --> 00:56:43.609]  And that just shows those police are out of their minds.
[00:56:43.689 --> 00:56:45.290]  I mean, this is America.
[00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:47.090]  That's why we're America.
[00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:51.091]  We have that free speech, but they've got free speech to criticize people in most countries.
[00:56:51.731 --> 00:56:53.292]  I mean, we are becoming
[00:56:54.577 --> 00:56:57.159]  One of the most authoritative, oppressive nations on Earth.
[00:56:57.179 --> 00:56:59.680]  And I'm telling you, Canada, it is a nightmare.
[00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:00.281]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:00.301 --> 00:57:04.403]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:57:04.704 --> 00:57:05.324]  Number one.
[00:57:05.624 --> 00:57:08.766]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:57:09.047 --> 00:57:09.527]  Number two.
[00:57:09.907 --> 00:57:14.448]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:57:14.788 --> 00:57:15.248]  It's true.
[00:57:15.528 --> 00:57:20.109]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:57:20.409 --> 00:57:20.949]  Number 3.
[00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:24.510]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:28.531]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:57:28.731 --> 00:57:29.291]  Number 4.
[00:57:29.531 --> 00:57:31.892]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:57:32.292 --> 00:57:35.673]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:57:35.973 --> 00:57:36.173]  Number 5.
[00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:40.676]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:57:40.896 --> 00:57:45.660]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:49.983]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:57:50.123 --> 00:57:51.684]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:58:00.592 --> 00:58:03.215]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:03.616 --> 00:58:08.582]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:08.942 --> 00:58:10.685]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:58:10.985 --> 00:58:15.811]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:58:15.991 --> 00:58:16.953]  How much do you want?
[00:58:17.193 --> 00:58:17.914]  When do you want it?
[00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:19.896]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:58:20.176 --> 00:58:20.997]  When will you need it?
[00:58:21.237 --> 00:58:23.299]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:58:23.459 --> 00:58:24.540]  Will there be any food?
[00:58:24.781 --> 00:58:26.122]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:58:26.322 --> 00:58:31.387]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:58:31.588 --> 00:58:34.731]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:58:35.171 --> 00:58:38.654]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:58:38.974 --> 00:58:39.955]  How much will you need?
[00:58:40.215 --> 00:58:40.815]  We don't know.
[00:58:41.115 --> 00:58:42.016]  How much do you want?
[00:58:42.216 --> 00:58:42.957]  All you can get.
[00:58:43.137 --> 00:58:43.997]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:44.238 --> 00:58:47.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:00:05.612 --> 01:00:06.252]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.912 --> 01:00:07.972]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.693 --> 01:00:09.793]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.433 --> 01:00:11.273]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.033 --> 01:00:13.493]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.573 --> 01:00:17.454]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.774 --> 01:00:21.875]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.015 --> 01:00:30.216]  Alright, we've got eyewitnesses to the amazing tyranny from the G20 up in Canada.
[01:00:30.876 --> 01:00:34.437]  Joining us for about 30 minutes or so, then I'll continue with your phone calls and news.
[01:00:35.657 --> 01:00:42.399]  We're into the last hour of this Monday, June 28, 2010 edition.
[01:00:43.999 --> 01:00:46.300]  Separately, I can't believe CNN's being honest.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:53.142]  Combo shots boost kids' fever-related seizure risk.
[01:00:54.182 --> 01:00:57.523]  Because, see, so many kids have a seizure on the way home after the triple shot.
[01:00:59.123 --> 01:01:00.784]  And then they're autistic after they wake up.
[01:01:02.341 --> 01:01:05.103]  After their IQ reduction, their chemical warfare IQ reduction.
[01:01:05.643 --> 01:01:06.764]  But here's CNN.
[01:01:07.004 --> 01:01:08.285]  But they report, it's alright.
[01:01:08.745 --> 01:01:10.066]  It makes your kid have seizures.
[01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:11.847]  But what's wrong with having seizures?
[01:01:12.207 --> 01:01:14.108]  Look, General Petraeus is having seizures.
[01:01:14.188 --> 01:01:14.789]  It's cool.
[01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:17.330]  It's a conspiracy theorist.
[01:01:18.671 --> 01:01:19.752]  Everyone has seizures.
[01:01:19.832 --> 01:01:20.873]  Everyone has cancer.
[01:01:20.893 --> 01:01:22.794]  You know, everybody's going sterile.
[01:01:23.034 --> 01:01:24.375]  People were always sterile.
[01:01:24.615 --> 01:01:25.756]  People were always dying.
[01:01:25.796 --> 01:01:26.756]  Drink more fluoride.
[01:01:26.796 --> 01:01:27.557]  Eat more GMO.
[01:01:28.547 --> 01:01:29.428]  I mean, here's the article.
[01:01:29.868 --> 01:01:30.529]  CNN Health.
[01:01:31.029 --> 01:01:34.072]  Combo Shot Boosts Kids' Fever-Related Seizure Risk.
[01:01:35.393 --> 01:01:36.414]  That's CNN.
[01:01:36.835 --> 01:01:37.455]  CNN.
[01:01:37.675 --> 01:01:38.296]  Here's another one.
[01:01:39.677 --> 01:01:41.259]  They're all up on InfoWars.com.
[01:01:41.299 --> 01:01:41.759]  Links to it.
[01:01:42.019 --> 01:01:42.620]  Here's another one.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.121]  This came out three days ago.
[01:01:45.342 --> 01:01:50.267]  Children over six months and under nine years should have received H1N1 vaccine
[01:01:53.089 --> 01:02:00.751]  Yet can expect to get two dosages of seasonal flu this fall if the Center for Disease Control adopts recommendations for its Vaccine Advisory Committee.
[01:02:01.231 --> 01:02:07.873]  And he goes on to say they're recommending another injection of H1N1 as well as the new seasonal flu shot.
[01:02:08.294 --> 01:02:10.314]  I mean, the last H1N1 was a hoax.
[01:02:10.374 --> 01:02:11.314]  It's an admitted hoax.
[01:02:11.335 --> 01:02:16.876]  The British Medical Journal, the European Union Committee, Wolfgang Wudarg, the doctor we had on.
[01:02:17.296 --> 01:02:18.477]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[01:02:18.757 --> 01:02:22.498]  And so they've got all this unused vaccine and they're saying, well, we'll just have the idiots
[01:02:23.078 --> 01:02:28.322]  You know, the 10, 20, 30 percent, depending on the country, record lows, numbers of people are taking it.
[01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.824]  We'll just have all the morons take it.
[01:02:31.144 --> 01:02:32.305]  Yeah, they'll take anything.
[01:02:32.986 --> 01:02:34.987]  All these soccer moms, look, they're kids.
[01:02:35.728 --> 01:02:45.236]  Folks, I was in a Slotsky's Sunday with my children before I went and met my parents to take them to see the old Robin Hood with whatever that guy's name was.
[01:02:45.276 --> 01:02:48.938]  The point is that I was in a Slotsky's.
[01:02:49.761 --> 01:02:54.943]  And there were literally two different kids with different families who were autistic wearing football helmets.
[01:02:56.244 --> 01:02:58.405]  But they were, like, medicalized football helmets.
[01:02:59.445 --> 01:03:02.526]  And these were good-looking kids who would have had futures.
[01:03:03.367 --> 01:03:04.707]  And they had good-looking parents.
[01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:10.390]  And I'll bet you my bottom dollar that all this tinkering with the genetic code and what's in the vaccines did that to them.
[01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:12.951]  We've had countless medical doctors on that have documented it.
[01:03:13.615 --> 01:03:15.017]  And I wanted to go over and warn them.
[01:03:15.077 --> 01:03:18.161]  Look, if you're going to have more kids, just don't do this to them.
[01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:20.003]  The government doesn't love you.
[01:03:20.083 --> 01:03:21.865]  Stop being so gullible.
[01:03:22.645 --> 01:03:28.408]  And I tell you, I can't really go to a movie with my kids, because row after row is just autistic children now.
[01:03:28.648 --> 01:03:31.730]  Pretty soon it'll be half the kids on your block can't talk and can't walk.
[01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:35.192]  You know, there'll be 18, you know, wearing their football helmet.
[01:03:35.752 --> 01:03:36.973]  And I'm not supposed to warn people.
[01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:38.454]  I'm supposed to be, take all your shots!
[01:03:38.894 --> 01:03:40.234]  Oh, it'll give you seizures!
[01:03:40.575 --> 01:03:41.875]  It'll give you Crohn's disease!
[01:03:42.156 --> 01:03:43.116]  I mean, here's CNN.
[01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:43.696]  Seizures.
[01:03:44.737 --> 01:03:46.098]  CNN!
[01:03:46.418 --> 01:03:48.279]  Even the Communist News Network will tell you.
[01:03:48.699 --> 01:03:50.120]  But see, it's all buyer beware.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:04:12.153]  All right, shifting out of the serious subject for a moment, before we get into a really serious subject, we were able to get Elena Kagan's college fraternity photos from the men's fraternity that she's in, and word is she's had a sex change, and that her idol is John Wayne Gacy.
[01:04:12.754 --> 01:04:13.734]  So John Wayne Langen,
[01:04:14.955 --> 01:04:18.297]  Elena Kagan-Gacy, and so there they are on PrisonPlanet.tv for you.
[01:04:18.598 --> 01:04:19.178]  There she is.
[01:04:19.198 --> 01:04:26.743]  Of course, she said that she wants to butcher the Bill of Rights and Constitution, not young boys in a basement, so that's certainly positive.
[01:04:27.284 --> 01:04:31.006]  And then we have another video of her on her way to her bachelor party.
[01:04:31.987 --> 01:04:34.469]  And here is that video, my friends.
[01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:36.430]  We have that video.
[01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:39.733]  Can we go ahead and... We're loading it up.
[01:04:40.914 --> 01:04:43.256]  Now, it was hard to get this video.
[01:04:43.316 --> 01:04:44.897]  It's Gene Ween and I'm Dean Ween, you know.
[01:04:45.437 --> 01:04:46.198]  I'm Elena Kagan.
[01:04:46.218 --> 01:04:47.479]  Peaches and Herb.
[01:04:47.499 --> 01:04:50.141]  It's kind of sad you got stuck with that name.
[01:04:50.441 --> 01:04:53.183]  Yeah, anyway, we're doing a gig tonight.
[01:04:53.203 --> 01:04:54.824]  We were wondering if you wanted to come out and play.
[01:04:55.465 --> 01:04:55.785]  Great!
[01:04:56.145 --> 01:04:57.346]  I'm in a band!
[01:04:59.027 --> 01:05:03.551]  I hopped aboard that bus knowing that I was on the road to fame and fortune.
[01:05:08.094 --> 01:05:08.534]  Wee!
[01:05:08.754 --> 01:05:09.155]  Wee!
[01:05:09.395 --> 01:05:09.595]  Wee!
[01:05:11.782 --> 01:05:29.853]  Yeah, we that's the name of the proto book written by a Russian based on that 1984 was influenced by So there you have it ladies and gentlemen Elena Kagan going to her bachelor party.
[01:05:30.374 --> 01:05:30.694]  Okay.
[01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:32.055]  Her real name is not
[01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:35.791]  John Wayne, Elena, Kagan, Gacy, okay?
[01:05:35.851 --> 01:05:36.411]  It's a joke.
[01:05:37.211 --> 01:05:51.815]  Because watching her scowl at the Congress today, in a fit of cornered rat behavior, even when people were groveling to her, they kept... They kept trying to smile at her.
[01:05:51.835 --> 01:05:57.317]  The female senators on the panel kept trying to... Barbara Boxer.
[01:06:00.031 --> 01:06:00.812]  I always get them mixed up.
[01:06:00.852 --> 01:06:02.833]  Was it Barbara Boxer or was it Dianne Feinstein?
[01:06:02.853 --> 01:06:03.493]  It was Boxer.
[01:06:04.234 --> 01:06:05.014]  No, it was Feinstein.
[01:06:05.034 --> 01:06:05.775]  It was Feinstein.
[01:06:06.755 --> 01:06:07.936]  Feinstein would try to smile.
[01:06:08.156 --> 01:06:09.017]  Hello!
[01:06:09.537 --> 01:06:11.439]  Thank you for being here, Kagan.
[01:06:12.019 --> 01:06:16.602]  I mean, it was... I can't even do the face.
[01:06:16.622 --> 01:06:18.363]  I mean, let me try to get the face exact.
[01:06:19.884 --> 01:06:23.967]  I don't have a big enough double chin, but I'll try.
[01:06:23.987 --> 01:06:27.089]  Let me just try to channel Elena Kagan for a moment.
[01:06:29.633 --> 01:06:30.714]  But see, I can't get the hatred.
[01:06:30.734 --> 01:06:39.299]  It was like a... But more like a... I almost got to power.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  Look, you senators.
[01:06:41.741 --> 01:06:42.981]  Goldman Sachs, it runs me.
[01:06:43.061 --> 01:06:45.903]  Put you in power, you'll do what you say right now.
[01:06:45.963 --> 01:06:47.364]  Good, I almost got control.
[01:06:47.384 --> 01:06:49.766]  I just gotta sit through this stupid thing.
[01:06:50.226 --> 01:06:54.188]  I'm on record saying that the Legislative has no power and the Judiciary should run everything.
[01:06:58.311 --> 01:06:59.411]  Alright, I'm going to settle down now.
[01:07:01.492 --> 01:07:05.114]  I've had my fun with the goblin creature for now.
[01:07:09.455 --> 01:07:19.259]  Let me introduce Charlie Veitch and Dan Dix.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:21.960]  And I know both these gentlemen.
[01:07:22.461 --> 01:07:25.242]  Charlie has the Lubb Police over in the UK, traveled over to
[01:07:27.369 --> 01:07:38.779]  Canada for the G20, and of course Dan Dix has pressed for truth and has put out countless investigative reports on YouTube that we routinely link to up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:07:39.139 --> 01:07:40.441]  Why is the G20 important?
[01:07:40.481 --> 01:07:54.253]  Well, the 20 finance heads of the industrialized world who all just so happen to be former Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase or Bank of England operatives, they always
[01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:59.400]  Then come in, a billion, two hundred millions being spent in Canada.
[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:00.480]  It's a total police state.
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:03.001]  They release police dogs on women in the U.S.
[01:08:03.061 --> 01:08:03.682]  and Pittsburgh.
[01:08:03.742 --> 01:08:05.142]  Martial law for three days.
[01:08:05.482 --> 01:08:06.563]  No one allowed outside.
[01:08:06.663 --> 01:08:08.744]  Randomly sound cannons attacking people.
[01:08:09.064 --> 01:08:10.305]  College students couldn't even.
[01:08:11.025 --> 01:08:12.626]  One of my reporters got arrested for no reason.
[01:08:12.646 --> 01:08:13.426]  We have video of it.
[01:08:13.466 --> 01:08:16.348]  And politely videotaping from a grassy hill.
[01:08:16.408 --> 01:08:17.748]  And they come and arrest him.
[01:08:18.209 --> 01:08:23.351]  And he watched Luke Rudowsky tortured in the military armory where they had him.
[01:08:24.251 --> 01:08:25.192]  I mean, this is, this is
[01:08:25.452 --> 01:08:26.032]  Real folks.
[01:08:26.732 --> 01:08:36.915]  And so the banker criminals come to your town and they practice federalizing and all the local police then become spies, spying on people at cafes, listening to your political speech.
[01:08:36.955 --> 01:08:44.456]  It's all over the news that they pass secret laws to just randomly arrest people and detain them in facilities with cameras over the toilets.
[01:08:45.317 --> 01:08:50.338]  And so to tell us what's happened in the last three, four days total as the global parasites come to town.
[01:08:51.478 --> 01:09:08.319]  uh... are these two gentlemen joining us via video skype uh... so whoever wants to go first uh... break down what's happening we we saw burning cars a lot of intel says that was a staged event the police made no effort to stop it but they will beat up any peaceful protester with pleasure drag you off to their facility
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:16.205]  And it looks like we've caught the Canadian police staging events before, and the Greek, and the British, and the Italian, and the U.S.
[01:09:17.546 --> 01:09:20.148]  But that always comes out a few months later in court hearings.
[01:09:20.768 --> 01:09:21.969]  What does this look like, gentlemen?
[01:09:23.322 --> 01:09:33.827]  Well, Alex, just yesterday, right after we got off your show, I got a call from one of our camera guys who called me and said, Dan, we're here at Queen and Spadina.
[01:09:33.947 --> 01:09:43.172]  We've been surrounded by riot police and they were arresting and detaining everybody and everyone who was encircled in that intersection.
[01:09:43.192 --> 01:09:52.857]  240 people were arrested, round up, detained, and taken downtown to what is now known as Trontonimal Bay.
[01:09:53.578 --> 01:09:56.802]  And, um, you know, it's just unbelievable.
[01:09:57.163 --> 01:10:05.174]  Charlie and I tried to get there as soon as we could to try to cover it, but we were blocked at every single turn that we tried to get to.
[01:10:05.475 --> 01:10:07.577]  The police said, you cannot get up there.
[01:10:07.598 --> 01:10:08.999]  The street is now closed.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:28.036]  And, um, yeah, 240 people were just rounded up and detained, uh, for peacefully, uh, just sitting there very peacefully protesting, and of course it was all justified, uh, because of the actions that they said took place the previous day, with burning, uh, police cars, which is extremely, extremely suspicious.
[01:10:28.616 --> 01:10:33.338]  Uh, when you consider that these things were allowed to burn, uh, for the media photo op.
[01:10:33.698 --> 01:10:45.444]  Uh, these cards were set on fire by the supposed black block anarchists, and I've been sent a photo from a good friend of mine at NAUresistance.org, uh, which shows that some of these black block guys
[01:10:46.204 --> 01:10:50.787]  Had the same clubs that the police were using at the front of the riot line.
[01:10:50.807 --> 01:10:52.388]  Well, I've seen the video and photos.
[01:10:52.428 --> 01:10:53.329]  They look like cops.
[01:10:53.369 --> 01:10:56.151]  And I said that two and a half years ago in Montebello.
[01:10:56.211 --> 01:10:59.693]  And headline, Royal Mountain Police admit that that was their officers.
[01:10:59.733 --> 01:11:05.477]  I forget the exact headline, but it's Royal Mountain Police admit their officers attacked other officers for the media.
[01:11:05.797 --> 01:11:07.038]  And we caught them in Denver.
[01:11:07.118 --> 01:11:08.479]  I said, look like provocateurs.
[01:11:08.499 --> 01:11:13.903]  Denver Post headline, you know, police posed as anarchist attacked other police.
[01:11:14.303 --> 01:11:15.424]  So they do this everywhere.
[01:11:15.544 --> 01:11:15.624]  And
[01:11:16.985 --> 01:11:20.047]  If they're not cops, we've proven they're foundation-funded.
[01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:20.788]  They're flown in.
[01:11:22.349 --> 01:11:25.152]  Yeah, that's exactly what we heard from many people here on the ground.
[01:11:25.552 --> 01:11:36.201]  I think it's beyond any reasonable suspicion now that these people are agent provocateurs, either allowed to do this by the police or actually police... Well, stay there.
[01:11:36.261 --> 01:11:42.827]  I want you guys to walk through what happened with this specifically and then get into other issues on the other side of this quick break.
[01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:49.010]  But this has happened over and over and over again, and it's meant to set a precedent to shut down our free speech.
[01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:54.713]  The same thing is done worldwide, ladies and gentlemen, and they are bringing these people in.
[01:11:56.058 --> 01:11:59.060]  I've had the anarchists tell me in Austin that they do work for the feds.
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.881]  That doesn't mean all anarchists.
[01:12:25.998 --> 01:12:26.699]  How much will you need?
[01:12:26.739 --> 01:12:27.379]  We don't know.
[01:12:27.399 --> 01:12:27.800]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:12:45.075 --> 01:12:47.838]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:12:48.138 --> 01:12:50.761]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:12:50.981 --> 01:12:51.742]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:13:02.538 --> 01:13:04.799]  And we're subject to other police action.
[01:13:04.999 --> 01:13:05.940]  Tyranny is here.
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:09.902]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:13:09.922 --> 01:13:12.403]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:13:12.423 --> 01:13:17.886]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:13:18.307 --> 01:13:24.530]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:30.513]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:13:30.934 --> 01:13:34.616]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:13:35.116 --> 01:13:39.139]  Prepare to enter the secret world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:13:39.399 --> 01:13:44.962]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:13:45.342 --> 01:13:48.424]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:13:48.904 --> 01:13:50.305]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:13:50.885 --> 01:13:51.326]  It's here.

[01:13:59.955 --> 01:14:09.697]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:14:09.977 --> 01:14:16.018]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:25.260]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:34.545]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:14:34.826 --> 01:14:39.428]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:14:39.889 --> 01:14:40.989]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:43.731]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[01:14:44.031 --> 01:14:45.513]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.

[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:52.780]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.381]  Don't answer it!
[01:15:02.259 --> 01:15:10.348]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[01:15:18.177 --> 01:15:22.259]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[01:15:48.433 --> 01:15:50.794]  That's ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.

[01:15:52.756 --> 01:15:52.876]  800-477-9256.
[01:15:52.916 --> 01:15:53.096]  That's 800-477-9256.
[01:16:15.836 --> 01:16:18.501]  This is all about global standardization.
[01:16:27.782 --> 01:16:32.547]  Doesn't matter if the G20 is meeting in London, or Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, or Toronto, Canada.
[01:16:32.987 --> 01:16:37.351]  They come in, laws are passed just so private security can arrest citizens.
[01:16:37.792 --> 01:16:41.075]  Laws are passed so citizens have no due process and can be arrested.
[01:16:41.515 --> 01:16:45.940]  People are grabbed, there's secret police on trains, spying on everyone.
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:48.422]  People are just taken away for no reason.
[01:16:48.823 --> 01:16:52.026]  That's the headline, secret law passed allows unlimited arrest.
[01:16:53.622 --> 01:17:06.093]  And then, magically, the anarchists show up, the police stand back, as is in these new videos, let them set police cars on fire that are parked there, and then let the media see it, and then they pull back and are left alone.
[01:17:06.533 --> 01:17:14.259]  In the case of Seattle and other cities, you then catch them in government buildings or in other buildings protected by police
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.942]  And I don't know how cops go along with this.
[01:17:16.982 --> 01:17:19.845]  Well, we've had cops speak up in Canada and the U.S.
[01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:21.646]  about it, and in Denver, Colorado.
[01:17:21.666 --> 01:17:22.427]  That's what we know about it.
[01:17:22.928 --> 01:17:29.454]  But going back to Charlie Veitch and Dan Dix, guys, going back to this provocateur action, I think that's most important.
[01:17:29.934 --> 01:17:31.235]  Tell us the intel you're getting.
[01:17:33.678 --> 01:17:35.619]  Well, a very interesting thing that...
[01:17:36.644 --> 01:17:37.325]  That happened.
[01:17:37.585 --> 01:17:49.556]  Charlie and I were in the middle of this particular protest where everybody got surrounded and they had blocked the street on Queen Street leading up to Spadina, the area where one of the police cars was on fire.
[01:17:50.136 --> 01:17:54.900]  And Charlie got on the bullhorn and said, you know, if this line is blocked, let's go north everybody.
[01:17:55.261 --> 01:18:00.906]  So everybody started to go this way and then all of a sudden the police opened up the line and allowed everyone to go through.
[01:18:01.446 --> 01:18:07.007]  Almost like as if they wanted us to be in that particular area where that police car was on fire.
[01:18:07.608 --> 01:18:12.749]  Because once we got the crowd to go in another direction, they opened up the line and said, well, let them through.
[01:18:13.269 --> 01:18:24.552]  So they let the hundreds and hundreds of protesters through where we were once blocked and moved us into the area where the police car was on fire and that's where they blocked everyone in and detained us.
[01:18:25.372 --> 01:18:30.634]  Charlie and I, lucky enough, got out just at the right time because we came back to my place to do the show.
[01:18:31.254 --> 01:18:32.814]  So we just missed that by a few minutes.
[01:18:32.834 --> 01:18:34.415]  So that was part of the photo op.
[01:18:34.775 --> 01:18:39.056]  Down the road, the FED boys, no doubt, torched the police cars.
[01:18:39.456 --> 01:18:43.097]  Then they were like, come on guys, we need you, we need the regular protesters.
[01:18:43.417 --> 01:18:45.158]  There's a jail cell waiting for you.
[01:18:45.598 --> 01:18:48.739]  You guys, Charlie just got out of jail the day before, that morning.
[01:18:49.159 --> 01:18:55.867]  Now you guys duck out to come be interviewed by me last night and then right on time because they could then arrest their bad guys.
[01:18:57.318 --> 01:18:58.879]  Yeah, absolutely Alex.
[01:18:59.339 --> 01:19:01.480]  Again, we were under massive surveillance.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:04.202]  Dan and I were getting pointed out by police officers.
[01:19:04.422 --> 01:19:07.764]  They had their $7,000 semi-professional cameras.
[01:19:08.304 --> 01:19:12.646]  And it's just for the grace of your show that we decided to duck out of this particular march.
[01:19:13.147 --> 01:19:24.373]  And Alex, how do you feel about the predictive programming effects of almost 300 protesters being rounded up in an urban area onto buses and taken away to a detention camp?
[01:19:25.404 --> 01:19:26.365]  Well, I mean, they admit it.
[01:19:26.385 --> 01:19:29.988]  I've seen it in Austin, I've seen it in New York City for the RNC 2004.
[01:19:31.329 --> 01:19:34.191]  It's done for any of these high security events the exact same way.
[01:19:34.711 --> 01:19:37.874]  They bring in their thugs, they let them attack, burn a few trash cans.
[01:19:37.934 --> 01:19:39.175]  It always turns out they're feds.
[01:19:39.235 --> 01:19:40.396]  They leave, they're protected.
[01:19:40.856 --> 01:19:46.161]  And then an hour later, a day later, they then attack peaceful crowds saying that you were the ones that did it.
[01:19:46.541 --> 01:19:49.463]  And I've walked up to these anarchists before and said, you know, I know you're fed.
[01:19:49.483 --> 01:19:50.184]  They're like, you're right.
[01:19:50.484 --> 01:19:51.405]  We're gonna get you too.
[01:19:52.046 --> 01:19:53.648]  And usually they're communist.
[01:19:54.569 --> 01:20:01.097]  Under their outfit they'll have a big red star on and they're flown in by foundations, paid for by big wealthy foundations.
[01:20:01.137 --> 01:20:02.599]  But other times they're actual cops.
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:09.308]  And I just hope people realize that the government's doing this as a form of false flag to demonize any type of demonstration.
[01:20:11.604 --> 01:20:27.449]  Yeah, Alex, I'd just like to take this opportunity to say to the people listening, and especially people in Toronto, if you were one of the 240 people who were arrested and detained and taken to the camp, please get in touch with me at dan at pressfortruth.ca.
[01:20:27.729 --> 01:20:35.852]  We would like to interview you about what happened, and so that we can get your story out to the world, because it's extremely important what took place here yesterday.
[01:20:36.212 --> 01:20:37.373]  Oh, it's incredibly important.
[01:20:37.393 --> 01:20:45.779]  And we've had callers today, one of them who said they were on a train, and there was like a plainclothes security woman who sat down next to them and listened to them.
[01:20:45.799 --> 01:20:49.162]  They weren't even wearing demonstration outfits or bandanas or anything.
[01:20:49.802 --> 01:21:00.890]  And then when the train stopped, she got off and pointed at them, and then police ran up and interrogated them for almost an hour, and then went ahead and just randomly arrested one of the people.
[01:21:01.411 --> 01:21:03.592]  And so, I mean, this is secret police.
[01:21:03.612 --> 01:21:04.413]  This is East Germany.
[01:21:05.373 --> 01:21:08.434]  But there was actually raids going on all over the city.
[01:21:08.834 --> 01:21:27.501]  The University of Toronto campus was raided, I believe it was a day ago or maybe two days ago, where 70 students at U of T, you know, riot cops just came in and raided their campus and arrested them all, suggesting that they were potentially going to cause violence the following day.
[01:21:28.948 --> 01:21:31.509]  And then magically there was a fire.
[01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.510]  Oh.
[01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:34.010]  Right on cue.
[01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:38.592]  Yeah, I'd just like to thank the scumbag idiots who gave the police these orders.
[01:21:38.832 --> 01:21:47.176]  They are really helping the Global Awakening with their sloppy job and exposing the illusion that these people are on our side to try and help us.
[01:21:47.196 --> 01:21:49.717]  If it's not September the 11th... Well, stay there, stay there.
[01:21:49.737 --> 01:21:50.397]  Let's talk about it.
[01:21:50.898 --> 01:21:51.818]  We're on the march.
[01:21:52.298 --> 01:21:53.899]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.839 --> 01:21:57.521]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:02.128 --> 01:22:05.769]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:22:06.089 --> 01:22:14.210]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:18.991]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:22:19.591 --> 01:22:30.393]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:22:31.033 --> 01:22:40.035]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:22:40.555 --> 01:22:45.576]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[01:23:57.172 --> 01:23:58.914]  This information is too important to wait.
[01:23:59.721 --> 01:24:03.964]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:24:04.264 --> 01:24:04.884]  Number one.
[01:24:05.185 --> 01:24:08.327]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:24:08.607 --> 01:24:09.187]  Number two.
[01:24:09.468 --> 01:24:14.031]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:24:14.371 --> 01:24:14.811]  It's true.
[01:24:15.111 --> 01:24:19.674]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:24:19.975 --> 01:24:20.515]  Number three.
[01:24:20.795 --> 01:24:24.077]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:24:24.397 --> 01:24:28.100]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:28.841]  Number 4.
[01:24:29.081 --> 01:24:31.443]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:24:31.843 --> 01:24:35.226]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:24:35.526 --> 01:24:35.747]  Number 5.
[01:24:36.327 --> 01:24:40.250]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:24:40.471 --> 01:24:45.235]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:24:45.515 --> 01:24:49.540]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.242]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:24:51.462 --> 01:24:53.545]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:24:53.725 --> 01:24:56.068]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:25:13.291 --> 01:25:18.637]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're not just talking about what's happening in Toronto by itself.
[01:25:19.217 --> 01:25:20.098]  It's all interconnected.
[01:25:20.118 --> 01:25:24.042]  You've got all this mainstream news where the White House says, yeah, we're taking over the Internet.
[01:25:24.563 --> 01:25:32.951]  You've got all these White House officials saying you have no right to a Second Amendment, no right to free speech, that they want to arrest people that criticize the government.
[01:25:33.992 --> 01:25:52.182]  You've got a banking bill that's passed the Senate committee and is going to go to the full Senate that literally gives the Federal Reserve, in the words of the Washington Post, near unlimited power to make whatever regulations they want over other banks.
[01:25:53.863 --> 01:25:54.884]  The total takeover.
[01:25:54.904 --> 01:25:56.765]  I mean, this is a seizure.
[01:25:56.805 --> 01:26:00.647]  This is the same as a foreign army landing on our shores.
[01:26:00.687 --> 01:26:02.388]  This is a corporate global government.
[01:26:03.508 --> 01:26:05.851]  And everywhere they go it's the same shake and bake.
[01:26:05.991 --> 01:26:08.254]  I watched them kick it off in 99 in Seattle.
[01:26:08.835 --> 01:26:10.537]  It's in my film Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:26:11.819 --> 01:26:14.502]  And they took people to the Sandpoint FEMA Naval Brig.
[01:26:15.403 --> 01:26:17.646]  There is your FEMA camp right there.
[01:26:18.615 --> 01:26:23.699]  And they took him to the Sandpoint FEMA Naval Brig and kept hundreds of peaceful protesters.
[01:26:23.739 --> 01:26:29.884]  And I have the police on the news saying, no one is allowed to have an anti-WTO sticker or button.
[01:26:30.464 --> 01:26:36.609]  And we have cops pulling women's cars over, looking for anti-WTO buttons.
[01:26:37.249 --> 01:26:39.271]  And when they don't find them, they go ahead and pepper spray them.
[01:26:39.311 --> 01:26:41.192]  I mean, this is the insane mental illness.
[01:26:41.753 --> 01:26:45.316]  All because they hired less than 50 thugs that were admittedly
[01:26:45.916 --> 01:26:47.457]  Because later police came out and talked about it.
[01:26:47.497 --> 01:26:48.377]  We have the interviews with them.
[01:26:48.797 --> 01:26:57.622]  Hired by a federal government funded foundation that then came into town and then were housed in a government building after they did their one day of attacking people.
[01:26:58.002 --> 01:27:00.063]  Then the cops were released on the peaceful crowds.
[01:27:00.583 --> 01:27:01.544]  This is a system.
[01:27:01.924 --> 01:27:05.145]  That's why you don't see big people, big crowds out demonstrating.
[01:27:06.266 --> 01:27:06.606]  It's simple.
[01:27:06.626 --> 01:27:07.627]  You go out and demonstrate now.
[01:27:09.877 --> 01:27:13.143]  Especially against the Globalist or the World Trade Organization or anything New World Order.
[01:27:13.443 --> 01:27:18.452]  They just hire thugs to come burn a police car and then they retreat and the police attack you!
[01:27:19.670 --> 01:27:21.131]  And they put it on the news that you did it.
[01:27:21.631 --> 01:27:23.932]  And that's why we're going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:27:24.472 --> 01:27:25.733]  But there's other ways to protest.
[01:27:25.753 --> 01:27:34.936]  You can put up handbills on telephone poles, you can call and talk radio, you can start websites, access TV, go to your city council, go to your county commissioner's court, go to your statehouse.
[01:27:35.296 --> 01:27:40.719]  You can educate people, you can unlock minds, and everyone, passive-aggressively, can stop
[01:27:41.579 --> 01:28:09.234]  going along with the system and start not complying and that's they only get away with this by us complying with them and i'm telling you gotta see yourselves as agents of liberty seventeen seventy six inside enemy operations everywhere you are every person that you walk by is an opportunity to unlock a mind everyone you see on the street is an opportunity every cop you see is an opportunity to inform somebody uh... there are so many things you can do
[01:28:10.214 --> 01:28:14.557]  So many things... I mean, I know a lot of people now that are just putting... They're not fake.
[01:28:15.157 --> 01:28:16.678]  They're just putting their own license plate on.
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:20.741]  And let's see the foreign toll roads work on that.
[01:28:22.261 --> 01:28:26.243]  There are people putting up micro-FM, known as pirate stations, that don't interfere with commercial stations.
[01:28:26.624 --> 01:28:27.504]  And they're putting out the truth.
[01:28:27.544 --> 01:28:28.185]  They don't care.
[01:28:28.505 --> 01:28:30.366]  People aren't going along with it.
[01:28:30.386 --> 01:28:34.288]  They're not being told what to do by a group of offshore banks looting and robbing us.
[01:28:34.528 --> 01:28:44.174]  Going back to Charlie Veitch and Dan Dix, both accomplished alternative media journalists and activists out there, about what we saw happen in Toronto.
[01:28:44.774 --> 01:28:50.778]  Now, I guess we didn't have any police dogs, though, biting old women coming out of grocery stores with daytime curfews.
[01:28:51.318 --> 01:28:56.345]  I guess we haven't seen any of that type of behavior.
[01:28:56.385 --> 01:28:58.047]  We haven't seen sound cannons out.
[01:28:59.429 --> 01:29:06.198]  It does sound like you guys are only getting a light helping of ultra police state versus what happened in the U.S.
[01:29:07.458 --> 01:29:08.319]  I guess so, Alex.
[01:29:08.399 --> 01:29:17.448]  I guess maybe they're trying to keep their PR under control after the absolute disaster that was Pittsburgh with Luke Hradowski being arrested there.
[01:29:18.228 --> 01:29:24.074]  You mentioned a few segments ago about CNN talking about seizures happening from vaccines.
[01:29:24.094 --> 01:29:31.321]  Well, interestingly enough, we're now seeing in Toronto the mainstream media is turning on the government and turning against the police because
[01:29:31.841 --> 01:29:41.648]  A few CTV reporters were rounded up, hogtied, thrown into a bus in the pouring rain, and taken to Guantanamo Bay as well, and on the outskirts of Toronto.
[01:29:41.728 --> 01:29:50.594]  So, as you see in America, the viewership for the mainstream media is collapsing, and now in Canada, we're seeing the corporate-controlled media turn against their masters.
[01:29:50.654 --> 01:29:51.694]  So it's a beautiful thing.
[01:29:51.714 --> 01:29:56.618]  And CTV reported in one of their articles, in fact, you guys printed it for me, but I can't find it.
[01:29:56.658 --> 01:29:57.258]  We printed it again.
[01:29:57.278 --> 01:29:58.579]  Actually, Rob Doob brought it in.
[01:29:58.899 --> 01:30:01.201]  At the end of the article, they talk about
[01:30:01.741 --> 01:30:10.464]  How it appeared the police did nothing to stop the people burning the cars, so they're kind of beginning to start investigating what really happened there.
[01:30:11.785 --> 01:30:15.526]  Yeah, it seems to be a big turning point, but I guess all these events are big turning points.
[01:30:15.906 --> 01:30:23.489]  But I need to, I need to really, we need to speak out to the good people who might be working alongside the G20 puppet masters or in the police.
[01:30:23.889 --> 01:30:26.390]  Why are the good people not speaking out?
[01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:27.970]  What are they scared of?
[01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:29.671]  Why are they under this control?
[01:30:31.769 --> 01:30:33.050]  Well, they feel like they're the winners.
[01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:34.350]  They feel like they're on the winning team.
[01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:40.213]  And even if they lean towards liberty a little bit, they still think it's safer to sit on the sideline.
[01:30:40.513 --> 01:30:40.693]  No.
[01:30:40.933 --> 01:30:41.834]  Things are too dark.
[01:30:41.874 --> 01:30:43.375]  Things are getting too serious, folks.
[01:30:43.695 --> 01:30:45.335]  We're entering a very dangerous time.
[01:30:45.816 --> 01:30:50.218]  All of you need to do whatever you can, whether it's getting information out.
[01:30:50.598 --> 01:30:58.502]  If you're a police officer, you know about a unit of police that was assigned to help these private contractor anarchists come in.
[01:31:00.253 --> 01:31:04.138]  Just like they use an anarchist to start World War I or an anarchist to bomb Wall Street.
[01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:05.599]  That was the bankers doing that.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:09.964]  An anarchist is just an agent of chaos so the system can come in.
[01:31:10.265 --> 01:31:12.848]  I don't mean an anarchist in its true sense.
[01:31:12.968 --> 01:31:20.337]  I mean these people calling themselves anarchist are normally just communist youth brigade people brought in by foundations.
[01:31:22.156 --> 01:31:22.916]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:31:22.996 --> 01:31:25.257]  I like to call myself a philosophical anarchist.
[01:31:25.317 --> 01:31:29.139]  I believe in the true ideals of anarchism against big government.
[01:31:29.419 --> 01:31:38.883]  But these black bloc children, most of them were very young, they were just there, oh, we're here to commit crime, we're here to just smash things up.
[01:31:38.963 --> 01:31:40.084]  They're just idiots.
[01:31:40.324 --> 01:31:46.727]  And I wish I was able to confront some of them, but strangely enough, the police didn't let us get anywhere near them because they were protecting them.
[01:31:47.247 --> 01:31:48.668]  So that's the way these things go.
[01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:51.645]  Well, that's how they got caught in Denver.
[01:31:52.645 --> 01:31:56.026]  That's how they got caught in Seattle and in Canada two and a half years ago.
[01:31:56.687 --> 01:32:10.292]  In Montebello, for those that want to look it up, was that they would then slip behind the police lines and be protected because I myself, for ten years, and many others since then, have been pointing out, follow the anarchists.
[01:32:10.412 --> 01:32:11.032]  Follow them.
[01:32:11.752 --> 01:32:14.994]  Nine times out of ten, they're going to end up going to a police substation.
[01:32:15.754 --> 01:32:21.418]  Yeah, if anyone's interested in learning about what happened in Montebello, they can check out a film I produced called The Nation's Deathbed.
[01:32:21.438 --> 01:32:23.860]  We documented the entire event that took place there.
[01:32:45.026 --> 01:32:53.151]  And me and Charlie have been working hard at the G20 to document everything that's going on, but the powers that be have been trying to stifle our efforts.
[01:32:53.612 --> 01:32:56.033]  On the key day, my website went down.
[01:32:56.954 --> 01:33:02.457]  Anytime I tried to have any communications with some of my camera guys, my cell phone would just drop out.
[01:33:03.098 --> 01:33:10.563]  When I came back to try to upload raw footage to YouTube, entire 3-4 minute chunks were cut out and all the audio was out of sync.
[01:33:11.003 --> 01:33:14.225]  So I was forced to put it on the Press for Truth Facebook group.
[01:33:14.785 --> 01:33:23.207]  So there are clearly people out there trying to stop independent journalists from getting the truth out about what actually happened in downtown Toronto.
[01:33:23.527 --> 01:33:31.368]  Well, that's a central point that you just raised there because when I was at Bilderberg 2008 covering it, we knew Obama was coming.
[01:33:31.749 --> 01:33:32.669]  He shook the media.
[01:33:33.069 --> 01:33:33.669]  He was there.
[01:33:34.009 --> 01:33:37.610]  The media for two days ran around like idiots trying to find out where he was.
[01:33:37.710 --> 01:33:38.090]  We knew.
[01:33:38.190 --> 01:33:38.810]  We told them.
[01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:41.951]  We called local newspapers and they just said we're not allowed to report.
[01:33:44.091 --> 01:33:55.836]  The day before they threw us out, all of this NSA and Mossad and military personnel and Secret Service were taking over the ballrooms and side offices and had surveillance equipment.
[01:33:55.876 --> 01:34:01.419]  And I actually walked by rooms and heard them going, I'm going to get that Navy satellite.
[01:34:01.479 --> 01:34:03.259]  Well, how do you patch through on the Army satellite?
[01:34:03.299 --> 01:34:04.020]  Wait, I've got him.
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:04.920]  I've got him.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:06.841]  Yeah, we've got protesters out at the front.
[01:34:07.281 --> 01:34:10.243]  And I'd be sitting there getting a Gatorade in the
[01:34:11.869 --> 01:34:12.129]  I don't
[01:34:35.598 --> 01:34:45.965]  So yes, when you have these special national security, international security events that cost $1.2 billion in security, they're bringing in private contractors by the tens of thousands.
[01:34:46.565 --> 01:34:57.132]  It's a giant exercise in Google-type technology, which they now admit is illegal and states are looking at indicting them, scooping up everybody's digital transmissions and decoding it without warrants.
[01:34:58.953 --> 01:35:01.215]  We had G20 security call us.
[01:35:01.775 --> 01:35:17.344]  When we saw the footage of the guy being grabbed in Pittsburgh and crammed into a car by guys in military uniforms into a champagne police car, and it went up on Drudge Report and people are saying, you know, snatch and grab, goons kidnap activists for no reason, and they put a press release out.
[01:35:17.385 --> 01:35:20.166]  First they called us, and I could hardly believe it, but I called the number.
[01:35:20.466 --> 01:35:22.307]  It was G20 security in Pittsburgh.
[01:35:23.362 --> 01:35:32.870]  And I talked to him and they said, no, Mr. Jones, that video is our private security personnel authorized by city emergency code and they said it to be detaining active troublemakers.
[01:35:34.341 --> 01:35:38.582]  And, but the issue is we later learned, because I can tell by the video, it was fake.
[01:35:39.222 --> 01:35:46.364]  They were out with their own operatives, grabbing protesters out of crowds to create a psy-op and scare people.
[01:35:46.824 --> 01:35:57.347]  So it's all about theater of the mind, what Charlie Veitch was just saying, about selling you that you're going to be snatched, you're going to be grabbed, don't come out to these, don't mess with the bankers.
[01:35:58.147 --> 01:36:00.910]  And of course they're patched into YouTube.
[01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:02.912]  Of course they're editing what you're doing.
[01:36:03.293 --> 01:36:06.196]  This is an exercise in warring against us.
[01:36:06.596 --> 01:36:10.040]  We're the legitimate people saying we don't want to be raped by the foreign banks.
[01:36:10.461 --> 01:36:12.843]  We don't want to go into serfdom like Greece or Iceland.
[01:36:13.324 --> 01:36:14.345]  And they're saying no.
[01:36:14.685 --> 01:36:16.267]  You're going to feel our full might.
[01:36:16.607 --> 01:36:19.571]  And so they are testing, and they admit this at each of these events,
[01:36:20.111 --> 01:36:22.592]  How to bring in their internationalization of a city.
[01:36:23.112 --> 01:36:24.372]  How to have secret police.
[01:36:24.753 --> 01:36:28.154]  How to have their criminal operation dominate everyone.
[01:36:28.434 --> 01:36:35.096]  This is about the city and your state, your region, your country, going under globalist control.
[01:36:35.396 --> 01:36:38.317]  And they are under globalist control in these events.
[01:36:38.337 --> 01:36:42.659]  This is about your city going under foreign private corporate control.
[01:36:42.739 --> 01:36:43.099]  Go ahead.
[01:36:44.042 --> 01:36:46.923]  Yeah, I'd just like to just touch upon that as well, Alex.
[01:36:47.363 --> 01:36:56.327]  I'm just so proud of the Toronto residents and the other associated protesters for the incredible restraint they showed amidst such police thuggery.
[01:36:56.747 --> 01:37:06.051]  The New World Order, they want a violent response from the public right now to further speed up their imposition of this technotronic advanced slave society.
[01:37:06.451 --> 01:37:12.262]  I believe right now, as what you're doing Alex, as what Dan is doing, as what I'm doing right now, we just need to unlock people's minds, wake them up.
[01:37:12.622 --> 01:37:15.708]  But I just want to give a warning to the New World Order that death will
[01:37:17.125 --> 01:37:23.588]  We've always failed throughout history, and as long as tyrants die, liberty will never be stopped.
[01:37:23.768 --> 01:37:30.051]  Throughout history, we've always won, and we are guided, we are divinely guided, and we will do whatever it takes.
[01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:36.454]  If they become much more fascist, we will resist the same way that they resisted in World War II Europe.
[01:37:36.534 --> 01:37:43.357]  We will do whatever it takes to defend what we believe in, because we are human beings, our lives have value, and we will not take it.
[01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:44.478]  But right now, they're not
[01:37:44.878 --> 01:37:46.519]  Forcing people to join the armed forces.
[01:37:46.539 --> 01:37:48.401]  They're not forcing people to go into McDonald's.
[01:37:48.421 --> 01:37:50.803]  They're not forcing people to take vaccinations.
[01:37:50.823 --> 01:37:51.964]  They're using mind control.
[01:37:51.984 --> 01:37:52.985]  Well, they're trying though.
[01:37:53.005 --> 01:37:54.726]  They're starting to get ready for that though.
[01:37:55.707 --> 01:37:56.007]  Yeah.
[01:37:59.590 --> 01:38:03.173]  Well gentlemen, other points that both of you want to make about what you witnessed while you're there.
[01:38:04.274 --> 01:38:04.734]  Absolutely.
[01:38:06.030 --> 01:38:23.122]  Whilst we were running down to Queen and Spadina to cover the mass concentration camp roundup of those 244 reporters and civilians, Dan and I got searched about three times and there was a boy, must have been about 17 years old, who was running through the rain.
[01:38:23.222 --> 01:38:28.425]  He was giving us a quick interview and then an unmarked car came blasting around the corner.
[01:38:28.525 --> 01:38:32.308]  Six officers jumped out and snatched him off the street in front of us.
[01:38:32.748 --> 01:38:42.074]  And then one of the officers, in fact all six of them, came into our little cubbyhole away from the rain and they started pointing at Dan saying, oh yeah, we know you, you're a known conspiracy theorist.
[01:38:42.494 --> 01:38:46.157]  Oh yeah, and we know Alex Jones, he's that tinfoil hat wearer.
[01:38:46.197 --> 01:38:47.958]  So they were mentioning you as well, Alex.
[01:38:47.998 --> 01:38:56.023]  So you can imagine the intelligence reports that get given about people like us, about how we're just crazy, paranoid, anti-government loonies.
[01:38:57.671 --> 01:39:02.993]  I guess Goldman Sachs hasn't stolen 600 trillion according to the Washington Post.
[01:39:03.533 --> 01:39:05.374]  I guess we're not going into a depression.
[01:39:05.434 --> 01:39:07.814]  I guess they didn't lie about WMDs.
[01:39:07.914 --> 01:39:10.135]  I guess they're not torturing people.
[01:39:10.235 --> 01:39:15.297]  I guess, I mean, don't these police understand what they're helping to build?
[01:39:17.006 --> 01:39:18.447]  I don't think they all do.
[01:39:18.527 --> 01:39:27.593]  I think, as we saw, a lot of them are chosen for their obedience, psychological acquiescence to power, as Alan Watts from Cutting Through the Matrix talks about.
[01:39:28.014 --> 01:39:35.059]  In the psychopathic hierarchy of control, they worship people more powerful than them, and they hate people less powerful, like the general public.
[01:39:35.499 --> 01:39:39.982]  So it is a kind of egomaniac, sadomasochist enjoyment of power.
[01:39:40.022 --> 01:39:41.443]  Well, it is a power trip.
[01:39:41.503 --> 01:39:45.106]  I mean, a lot of these people who do work for the government,
[01:39:45.887 --> 01:39:50.121]  Uh, never had success in life and suddenly they're given a badge, a gun, all this power and...
[01:39:52.745 --> 01:39:56.487]  But I mean, it's coming out everywhere that everything we've talked about is true.
[01:39:57.028 --> 01:40:03.932]  And they would say five years ago that I was a kook, that they weren't going to set up cyber security when I'd read the Pentagon plans for it that were public.
[01:40:04.233 --> 01:40:06.854]  And now they're openly saying, yes, we're going to track you.
[01:40:07.215 --> 01:40:08.395]  Yes, we're going to spy on you.
[01:40:08.435 --> 01:40:09.616]  Yes, we're going to shut you down.
[01:40:09.976 --> 01:40:12.478]  Yes, we want to arrest people that tell conspiracy theories.
[01:40:13.018 --> 01:40:16.501]  I mean, what do they think is going to happen when they start trying to arrest people for their speech?
[01:40:17.061 --> 01:40:19.543]  Everybody's been fighting as hard as they can to keep this peaceful.
[01:40:20.123 --> 01:40:23.247]  But I don't think they realize we're not the poor, disarmed Russian peasants.
[01:40:23.708 --> 01:40:25.050]  We're not the disarmed Germans.
[01:40:25.831 --> 01:40:28.494]  And not everybody is a pot-bellied, decadent slob.
[01:40:28.514 --> 01:40:34.642]  I mean, I don't think all these little kids in black uniforms realize that they are really starting something that isn't going to end well.
[01:40:36.187 --> 01:40:37.827]  I agree with you Alex 100%.
[01:40:38.728 --> 01:40:45.490]  Across the world I think people are ready to do whatever it takes because we've got nothing left to lose.
[01:40:45.570 --> 01:41:02.654]  I mean they've taken away everything and they're trying to take away the very last vestiges of our freedom so we need to ask ourselves are we human beings or are we slaves and it's a fundamental point and I truly believe that the victory is already half won the moment we spiritually and psychologically say that we will not take it anymore
[01:41:02.654 --> 01:41:03.434]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:41:03.474 --> 01:41:11.879]  We've got to get angry, we've got to get comfortable speaking out in public, and we've got to get really aggressive at InfoWar, not just with t-shirts or banner hangs on highways.
[01:41:12.239 --> 01:41:27.688]  What one person can do in their neighborhood, putting up a hundred simple computer printouts, black and white, with a message or a website, or micro-FM or AM, or local TV broadcasts that go into a few neighborhoods, or
[01:41:28.468 --> 01:41:30.770]  I mean, people have just got to make a scene.
[01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:32.211]  They've got to get aggressive.
[01:41:32.612 --> 01:41:43.981]  And every day, videos and articles and information gets sent to us that people are producing that does get the word out, and of the artist, and people just turn their power loose.
[01:41:44.241 --> 01:41:48.365]  I mean, who's that artist that goes up and paints billboards with anti-corporate messages?
[01:41:49.185 --> 01:41:49.626]  Banksy.
[01:41:51.267 --> 01:41:53.388]  I think one of them's English is his last name?
[01:41:53.708 --> 01:41:54.909]  Yeah, his name is Banksy.
[01:41:55.149 --> 01:41:55.349]  Yeah.
[01:41:56.089 --> 01:42:02.512]  And I'm not saying people should do that in face of this tyranny, but my point is we haven't even begun to fight.
[01:42:02.772 --> 01:42:05.013]  We haven't begun to take everything back.
[01:42:05.294 --> 01:42:06.874]  And they're trying to intimidate us now.
[01:42:06.914 --> 01:42:08.575]  They're trying to beat us into submission.
[01:42:08.915 --> 01:42:12.717]  They're trying to sell us on shutting up because we do have power.
[01:42:13.017 --> 01:42:15.438]  And so the answer is don't shut up when they intimidate us.
[01:42:15.658 --> 01:42:16.819]  Get ten times louder.
[01:42:18.223 --> 01:42:34.555]  Absolutely, and I'd just like to say if anyone who is prominent in the truth movement gets arrested or detained for some rubbish reason, I would really like to see a mass jailbreak of thousands of people just turning up outside this prison and really putting the prison guards on the spot.
[01:42:35.097 --> 01:42:43.001]  Because there's something about vast numbers of people which really terrifies the black paramilitary psychopathic lower-level security agents.
[01:42:43.041 --> 01:42:50.805]  And when they see that people will not stand up for this kind of tyranny in one massive movement, then they might be suddenly educated.
[01:42:52.085 --> 01:42:53.306]  Well, they need to pick a side.
[01:42:53.346 --> 01:42:56.968]  I mean, this is tyranny period, and it's time for these people to quit laughing at us.
[01:42:56.988 --> 01:42:58.008]  They need to make a decision.
[01:42:58.028 --> 01:42:58.849]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:00.959 --> 01:43:04.262]  It's the number one reason for slow and clogged bath drains.
[01:43:04.542 --> 01:43:05.843]  That's right, hair.
[01:43:06.203 --> 01:43:09.146]  And the number one way to open drains plugged with hair?
[01:43:09.426 --> 01:43:10.467]  The drain claw.
[01:43:11.327 --> 01:43:13.269]  Stop standing in dirty bath water.
[01:43:13.509 --> 01:43:15.170]  Stop using dangerous chemicals.
[01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:19.834]  Just push the drain claw past the pop-up in your sink or tub, twist, and pull.
[01:43:19.854 --> 01:43:23.517]  You'll be shocked at what this little tool can pull out of your drain.
[01:43:23.777 --> 01:43:30.762]  The Drain Claw has over 100 tiny hooks that claw through hair, toothpaste and shampoo that slows and clogs your drains.

[01:43:51.458 --> 01:43:52.720]  Buy the Drain Claw.

[01:44:00.649 --> 01:44:05.512]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:44:05.612 --> 01:44:06.393]  What have we got?
[01:44:06.613 --> 01:44:08.754]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:44:09.054 --> 01:44:09.795]  A republic.
[01:44:10.075 --> 01:44:12.636]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:44:12.717 --> 01:44:14.638]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:44:14.978 --> 01:44:16.879]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:44:16.999 --> 01:44:18.280]  So they think they own our land?
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:19.801]  They think they own our water?
[01:44:20.001 --> 01:44:20.401]  Children?
[01:44:20.601 --> 01:44:21.402]  Our education?
[01:44:21.722 --> 01:44:22.362]  Our money?
[01:44:22.563 --> 01:44:26.225]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:44:26.565 --> 01:44:30.230]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:31.252]  You're being warned.
[01:44:31.552 --> 01:44:32.373]  We have the facts.
[01:44:32.573 --> 01:44:33.695]  We have the Constitution.
[01:44:33.735 --> 01:44:34.616]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:44:34.636 --> 01:44:35.477]  We have common law.
[01:44:35.517 --> 01:44:37.780]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:38.041 --> 01:44:41.826]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:44:41.926 --> 01:44:46.711]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:44:46.892 --> 01:44:48.253]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:44:48.393 --> 01:44:49.234]  Don't tread on me.
[01:44:49.475 --> 01:44:55.902]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:45:00.632 --> 01:45:02.714]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[01:45:03.154 --> 01:45:06.257]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[01:45:06.717 --> 01:45:14.704]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[01:45:15.205 --> 01:45:20.129]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[01:45:20.689 --> 01:45:25.794]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[01:45:26.314 --> 01:45:33.842]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness, and put up tons of free food too.
[01:45:34.363 --> 01:45:39.348]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[01:45:39.808 --> 01:45:41.029]  Our foods are their enemy.
[01:45:41.610 --> 01:45:47.075]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[01:45:47.475 --> 01:45:50.137]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[01:45:50.458 --> 01:45:53.701]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[01:45:53.721 --> 01:45:55.202]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence.
[01:46:19.801 --> 01:46:22.082]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the final segment.
[01:46:22.102 --> 01:46:23.563]  I'll be back tomorrow live, 11 a.m.
[01:46:23.583 --> 01:46:24.144]  to 3 p.m.
[01:46:24.604 --> 01:46:25.525]  Central Standard Time.
[01:46:25.545 --> 01:46:27.065]  I appreciate everybody tuning in today.
[01:46:29.227 --> 01:46:37.352]  This is systematic twisting of our police, systematic twisting of the citizenry and the media to accept all of this.
[01:46:38.072 --> 01:46:44.336]  The good news is, I'm seeing even the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal admit that this is an engineered depression.
[01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:49.331]  Because not everyone in media and government is controlled.
[01:46:49.391 --> 01:46:52.411]  They're compartmentalized and controlled by the propaganda.
[01:46:53.032 --> 01:46:59.533]  Once the propaganda, you know, the sleeping gas is sucked out of the room, people start waking up.
[01:46:59.953 --> 01:47:01.834]  Most people are not truly evil.
[01:47:02.834 --> 01:47:09.616]  When you talk about a Dick Cheney or a George Bush or a Cass Sunstein, those people are evil because we have their writings.
[01:47:11.045 --> 01:47:12.426]  Uh, Obama is evil.
[01:47:12.826 --> 01:47:16.667]  I mean, he's continuing the torture, the wars, uh, saying it's good.
[01:47:16.807 --> 01:47:25.590]  They know, I mean, these are people, they've got, again, legislation introduced to arrest citizens for any reason and have you disappear into a black hole.
[01:47:26.772 --> 01:47:27.852]  The same thing in England.
[01:47:27.952 --> 01:47:31.293]  And I keep repeating that because it's now mainstream news.
[01:47:31.693 --> 01:47:35.894]  We have 46 states, here's Bloomberg, going bankrupt.
[01:47:36.895 --> 01:47:37.875]  46 states.
[01:47:38.295 --> 01:47:43.816]  That's why they've been, you notice as soon as they started selling derivatives in 99, they started setting up a police state.
[01:47:44.537 --> 01:47:48.057]  Because the IMF and World Bank have done this in countless third world countries.
[01:47:48.678 --> 01:47:51.258]  They've done this over and over and over again.
[01:47:51.338 --> 01:47:53.419]  They know what they're doing.
[01:47:54.139 --> 01:47:56.140]  And they know you're going to end up rioting.
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:02.503]  So I don't want violence, just like these anarchists gave this system a pretext to crack down.
[01:48:03.564 --> 01:48:10.547]  We want to peacefully go out and get the moral high ground and point out to the general public who the real criminals are.
[01:48:11.641 --> 01:48:19.483]  But down the road, if they start trying to arrest political dissidents and take us to death dungeons, it's going to be like Robin Hood all over again.
[01:48:19.543 --> 01:48:24.444]  People aren't going to have a choice, and you will start seeing black arrows flying.
[01:48:25.284 --> 01:48:30.005]  And that's what happens when the badge and the government becomes a complete tyranny.
[01:48:30.585 --> 01:48:41.028]  I'm fighting to avert this as hard as I can, but as JFK said, those that make peaceful revolutions impossible make violent revolutions inevitable.
[01:48:42.188 --> 01:48:45.690]  Or those that make peaceful change impossible, make violent revolutions inevitable.
[01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:46.651]  I'm paraphrasing it.
[01:48:47.291 --> 01:49:07.924]  But going back to Charlie Veitch and Dan Dix, again, our websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but it's very important to contact those guys up in Canada, especially Dan Dix, because he'll be able to put together, he's a good filmmaker, a piece that will be able to live on and inspire people to understand what the G20 does when they come to their area.
[01:49:08.184 --> 01:49:11.266]  Guys, we're almost out of time, but I wanted to go back to Dan Dix and just say this.
[01:49:14.042 --> 01:49:22.298]  Dan, specifically, the police knew who you were, and knew who Charlie was, and they were also concerned about me.
[01:49:24.025 --> 01:49:25.086]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:25.646 --> 01:49:29.670]  I've been approached, I don't know, 30 or 40 times by police.
[01:49:29.690 --> 01:49:34.914]  95% of them look like they don't like me or what I do.
[01:49:35.255 --> 01:49:39.418]  There was a very small percentage of guys who would be like, hey, you're that guy, right on!
[01:49:39.438 --> 01:49:43.221]  A very small percentage of the police seem to like what I do.
[01:49:43.842 --> 01:49:47.365]  But definitely I'm getting recognized now because of the videos.
[01:49:48.005 --> 01:49:50.228]  We are going to be putting up a new video tonight.
[01:49:50.268 --> 01:49:52.631]  We're going to be working very hard on it for the next few hours.
[01:49:53.111 --> 01:49:57.036]  And basically we documented everything that happened on this weekend.
[01:49:57.396 --> 01:50:04.284]  So people can tune in to PressForTruth.ca to check out the new video that we should have up online tonight.
[01:50:04.865 --> 01:50:08.529]  And also in a few hours, Charlie and I are going to be going down
[01:50:08.989 --> 01:50:26.039]  at 530 in downtown Toronto at College and Bay Street, which is the headquarters for the police, to send them a message, perhaps get on the bullhorn, maybe read out the oath that they swore to uphold, and let them know that... Good job!
[01:50:26.099 --> 01:50:26.899]  People should join you.
[01:50:26.939 --> 01:50:27.600]  We're out of time.
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:28.620]  Gentlemen, continue.
[01:50:30.041 --> 01:50:31.843]  We're out of time, great job to my crew.
[01:50:32.003 --> 01:50:39.589]  There is the G20, the bankers deciding our future and spending a billion two hundred million dollars of taxpayer money and violating free speech.
[01:50:42.491 --> 01:50:44.533]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:45.113 --> 01:50:48.396]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:48.616 --> 01:50:54.280]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:59.104]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned
