[00:00:04.193 --> 00:00:04.833]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.494 --> 00:00:06.535]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.276 --> 00:00:08.417]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.037 --> 00:00:09.838]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:11.520]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.763]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:20.408]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.594 --> 00:00:26.578]  Well, Michigan is considering a law to license journalists.
[00:00:27.138 --> 00:00:29.861]  The same thing has already started up in Washington State.
[00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:32.724]  Tyranny's here, folks.
[00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:44.635]  Israel now has three nuclear subs, German-built, with nuclear cruise missiles, nuclear weapon-tipped cruise missiles, warhead-tipped cruise missiles, off the coast of Iran, threatening to nuke them at any time.
[00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:50.758]  Turkey's saying this could cause war, so is Syria and Lebanon.
[00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:56.721]  Turkey says they're dispatching warships with the next flotilla because a Turkish flagship was attacked.
[00:00:56.741 --> 00:00:59.102]  It's an act of war, folks, like Ron Paul said.
[00:00:59.422 --> 00:01:00.943]  A blockade is an act of war.
[00:01:01.323 --> 00:01:02.743]  Gaza is sovereign.
[00:01:04.244 --> 00:01:11.067]  And, you know, again, folks, this isn't some macho talk or what side you're on, okay?
[00:01:12.248 --> 00:01:13.289]  I want to stop war.
[00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:14.390]  I don't hate Israel.
[00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.411]  Okay?
[00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:18.353]  And I don't hate the Palestinians.
[00:01:18.973 --> 00:01:20.995]  The average person over there just wants to live in peace.
[00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:25.879]  And the Arab governments have done a lot to not let Gazans get out into Egypt and other areas.
[00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.240]  But look at Egypt.
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.122]  Can they take a million and a half refugees on?
[00:01:30.722 --> 00:01:34.385]  But this attack... Here's the $64 million question.
[00:01:35.826 --> 00:01:38.849]  Are the explosions and gunfire we hear rubber bullets
[00:01:40.796 --> 00:01:51.622]  Flash bangs and tear gas when the Israeli naval gunboats are attacking or are they real rounds?
[00:01:51.842 --> 00:02:01.427]  If they're lead or full metal jacket rounds, this is an act of war, an act of piracy, an act of just criminality.
[00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.408]  It is an act of aggression.
[00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.710]  It's what the Nuremberg Code covers.
[00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:16.109]  If they knew weapons were being shipped in, we're going to break and come back with Mike Rivero joining us video Skype.
[00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:28.098]  If they have absolute proof weapons were being brought into Gaza, under international law just like the 1961 Cuban Missile Crisis, they could go out in international waters and stop those ships, but it's very specific.
[00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:32.382]  They could fire across the bow, they didn't stop, they could shoot the rudder off.
[00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:39.160]  But if they fired on anybody on that unarmed ship, it is a serious crime.
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.845]  Now, the Arabs, the Arab media, did report that no one hit the Israelis or stabbed them.
[00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:56.995]  There's now stills and video shot by Al Jazeera, by Press TV, so by Arab-friendly media, Muslim-friendly media, showing them beating the commandos as they hit the deck.
[00:02:57.315 --> 00:02:59.597]  Now, if the Israelis were firing at them,
[00:03:00.982 --> 00:03:02.863]  Even with flashbangs, those can kill you.
[00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:05.143]  What do you expect the people to do?
[00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:08.604]  And I made the joke at the start of the show, a sick joke.
[00:03:09.644 --> 00:03:12.225]  It's really not even a joke, it's dark satire to illustrate something.
[00:03:13.105 --> 00:03:28.490]  If Ahmadinejad fired at an Israeli bomber at 80,000 feet, if at 80,000 feet a bomber dropped an airburst hydrogen 50 megaton bomb on Tehran,
[00:03:29.944 --> 00:03:46.517]  As that plane flies over, if Ahmadinejad, or even an Iranian child, fired at it with a slingshot, the media would call the child a coward, and would call the slingshot the most deadly weapon in the known galaxy.
[00:03:47.137 --> 00:03:49.839]  They'd call it a black hole projecting weapon or something.
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.462]  They'd call it a end of days devil weapon.
[00:03:54.783 --> 00:03:58.826]  They'd call it just the ultimate demon.
[00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:05.394]  And so that's the new situation, and the world sees the hypocrisy, whether you support Israel or not.
[00:04:05.994 --> 00:04:17.358]  Look, armored ships coming up to unarmed former cruise ships and attacking them, and commandos coming on board, and people fighting them with pipes.
[00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:25.474]  Humans, on average, are going to emotionally side with the people fighting with stones and rocks and pipes.
[00:04:26.035 --> 00:04:28.276]  And that's why the whole world is turning against Israel.
[00:04:28.717 --> 00:04:33.400]  Whereas 30 years ago, when the Arabs were always attacking Israel, the people sided with Israel.
[00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:34.782]  Because they were the little guy.
[00:04:34.862 --> 00:04:35.762]  They were the underdog.
[00:04:36.123 --> 00:04:38.024]  Israel is not the underdog in all of this.
[00:04:38.685 --> 00:04:41.307]  And Israel's talking about nuclear war now.
[00:04:41.807 --> 00:04:43.468]  This is a very serious situation.
[00:04:43.528 --> 00:04:46.471]  So, we're going to get Mike Rivera's take on this.
[00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:54.072]  When we get back on the other side of this break and your phone calls, Webster Tarpley is going to give us his take coming up in the last hour today.
[00:04:54.712 --> 00:04:55.152]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.193 --> 00:05:00.453]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:00.493 --> 00:05:05.834]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:05:06.074 --> 00:05:10.695]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:05:11.095 --> 00:05:11.475]  It's true.
[00:05:11.575 --> 00:05:16.116]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:05:16.656 --> 00:05:21.359]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.801]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:05:24.201 --> 00:05:28.804]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:05:29.004 --> 00:05:29.905]  And here's the best part.
[00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:32.887]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:36.489]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.651]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:05:39.992 --> 00:05:41.893]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:43.154]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:05:46.776 --> 00:05:48.557]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:55.520]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.221]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:04.315]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:12.777]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:06:13.517 --> 00:06:17.558]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:06:18.138 --> 00:06:28.960]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:38.603]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:39.103 --> 00:06:44.145]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:06:44.545 --> 00:06:51.728]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:52.028 --> 00:06:54.769]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:06:58.652 --> 00:07:02.595]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:07:02.835 --> 00:07:08.879]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:07:09.239 --> 00:07:16.344]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:21.168]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:07:21.488 --> 00:07:29.971]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[00:07:30.151 --> 00:07:33.953]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:07:34.413 --> 00:07:40.615]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:07:41.176 --> 00:07:44.537]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:07:45.077 --> 00:07:53.063]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:07:53.143 --> 00:07:53.603]  Thank you!
[00:08:00.783 --> 00:08:06.425]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:06.505 --> 00:08:12.487]  All right, we're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:12.587 --> 00:08:16.949]  Once a month, Mike Rivero joins us, Genesis Talk Show host.
[00:08:17.429 --> 00:08:19.190]  Also, it's the website WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.551]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:23.531 --> 00:08:33.201]  And he has really done a lot of research on the Israeli-slash-Palestinian conflict, what's been happening in Gaza, what's been going on in Lebanon.
[00:08:33.961 --> 00:08:41.889]  But I specifically want him to give us his take today, and I'm going to speak to this and take your phone calls at 800-259-9231, on where you see all this going.
[00:08:47.133 --> 00:08:50.115]  Because, you know, a lot of people don't pay attention to what's happening in Israel.
[00:08:50.135 --> 00:08:56.060]  You know, this tribal warfare has been going on for thousands of years between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
[00:08:57.621 --> 00:09:02.025]  And it's only intensifying, but people kind of get mentally worn out.
[00:09:02.745 --> 00:09:20.057]  they get exhausted uh... and uh... they stop paying attention but this is a new escalation with turkey not not just lebanon or syria the usual suspects threatening war saying this could cause war but turkey this was a turkish flagged former cruise ship attacked
[00:09:20.817 --> 00:09:26.079]  Anyway, you slice it in international waters, and Turkey is angry.
[00:09:26.239 --> 00:09:32.601]  A top ally, along with the United States, of Israel.
[00:09:32.961 --> 00:09:36.322]  So a huge political shift here.
[00:09:36.902 --> 00:09:38.062]  And so we're going to be discussing that.
[00:09:38.142 --> 00:09:42.584]  And coming up later, Michigan considers law to license journalists.
[00:09:43.424 --> 00:09:46.345]  This is in the Associated Press, Reuters, and Fox News.
[00:09:46.785 --> 00:09:49.886]  And what's scary is the media is reporting it like it's reasonable.
[00:09:50.737 --> 00:09:54.358]  And other states are moving as well, to where I won't be able to be on the air.
[00:09:54.498 --> 00:09:56.059]  No, I have to have a government license.
[00:09:56.659 --> 00:09:57.760]  They have to approve.
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:04.182]  And that's what the New York Times and also many members of the White House, Obama czars, are saying.
[00:10:04.642 --> 00:10:05.683]  You have to be vetted.
[00:10:06.638 --> 00:10:15.744]  We have to decide, or we're going to put messages up on your website, government pop-ups, that say stuff isn't true, or that directs you to government or other media.
[00:10:16.705 --> 00:10:18.046]  Of course, that was in the news last week.
[00:10:18.246 --> 00:10:19.907]  We're kicking their hind ends.
[00:10:20.468 --> 00:10:22.269]  They are going to try this.
[00:10:22.349 --> 00:10:24.671]  So, you better enjoy the internet while it's here.
[00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:28.014]  And you better use it to wake people up while it's here.
[00:10:28.314 --> 00:10:30.676]  Because the new media is destroying the old media.
[00:10:30.716 --> 00:10:33.739]  And so you got the mainstream media teamed up with government wanting to block that.
[00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:35.520]  So we'll get Mike Rivero's take on that.
[00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:39.604]  Also, I had a lady coming in next hour, a friend of my wife, but she chickened out.
[00:10:40.004 --> 00:10:40.805]  And I don't blame her.
[00:10:42.046 --> 00:10:42.767]  A lot of people do.
[00:10:42.787 --> 00:10:44.228]  That's why this country's falling apart.
[00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.973]  Even though when I said, look, I won't use your real name, her daughter went to
[00:10:52.338 --> 00:10:59.801]  One of the suburbs in Austin, first grade, and I was talking to her at a birthday party this weekend for my daughter.
[00:11:01.983 --> 00:11:06.946]  And, uh, it was out in Lakeway, and they basically turned the kids against the parents.
[00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:08.307]  They have them coming home and crying.
[00:11:08.607 --> 00:11:11.389]  Every time they see a development, they're taught that bunny rabbits are dying.
[00:11:11.749 --> 00:11:14.251]  Other mothers were there saying, yeah, that's why I took my kids out of school.
[00:11:14.451 --> 00:11:15.791]  We know them because of a homeschooling group.
[00:11:16.272 --> 00:11:21.655]  Uh, that they come in and don't tell the kids that it's a drill, and they turn the lights off, and a man in a mask comes in with a gun.
[00:11:22.736 --> 00:11:24.737]  But she chickened out to come on the show, and that's okay.
[00:11:26.138 --> 00:11:31.201]  Because she also had the document, but separately I had this out of the Washington Post, uh, where
[00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:38.317]  They say that under a red-level terror emergency, your children will be taken to FEMA centers.
[00:11:38.918 --> 00:11:41.282]  And that's in the Washington Post.
[00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:43.646]  We wrote an article about it four years ago.
[00:11:44.006 --> 00:11:47.031]  But the point is, she got one of these at that elementary school.
[00:11:48.286 --> 00:11:50.527]  Okay, so this is part of a FEMA operation.
[00:11:50.547 --> 00:11:51.088]  Well, guess what?
[00:11:52.348 --> 00:11:58.152]  Even though she won't come on the show today, I have mainstream news articles about it separately in other parts of the country, so that's coming up.
[00:11:58.452 --> 00:11:59.253]  But enough of me.
[00:11:59.993 --> 00:12:05.156]  Let's go to Mike Rivero joining us via video Skype, if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer.
[00:12:05.596 --> 00:12:08.818]  If not, he'll be joining you via the audio spectrum for radio listeners.
[00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:11.340]  Mike, let's run through the gamut.
[00:12:12.401 --> 00:12:16.569]  Break down what you see happening, from the latest info, what really happened.
[00:12:17.851 --> 00:12:24.564]  If you have a clearer picture, I know it's still somewhat foggy, of what happened to the flotilla yesterday and what this is going to do internationally.
[00:12:25.799 --> 00:12:29.121]  Well, the situation with the flotilla, as you say, it's very murky.
[00:12:29.221 --> 00:12:31.082]  Israel has a complete media blackout.
[00:12:31.342 --> 00:12:34.143]  People are not being allowed to talk to the prisoners.
[00:12:34.803 --> 00:12:45.389]  We don't even have a complete list of the names of the people who've been killed, although the number is now 20, we're being told, that died in this situation.
[00:12:46.729 --> 00:12:53.493]  We are aware of what happened mostly because of one live video feed that was able to get off the ship while it was being attacked.
[00:12:54.073 --> 00:13:12.298]  In that video feed, apparently the Israeli troops that were coming on board were carrying these pre-printed target lists of activists that were supposed to be killed, and we just had a member of the Nesset basically go public saying that Israel wanted to have a lot of deaths as a deterrent to any more of these blockade runners.
[00:13:12.678 --> 00:13:16.019]  But the bottom line is, this is clearly a violation of international law.
[00:13:16.579 --> 00:13:22.803]  When you are a ship at sea, that deck of your ship is the sovereign territory of the nation whose flag you fly.
[00:13:22.823 --> 00:13:23.903]  It's like a foreign embassy.
[00:13:24.324 --> 00:13:30.087]  When you set foot on the deck of a ship flying the flag of the United States of America, you are setting foot on U.S.
[00:13:30.147 --> 00:13:30.627]  territory.
[00:13:30.787 --> 00:13:36.130]  When you set foot on the deck of a ship flying the Turkish flag, you are setting foot on Turkish territory.
[00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.992]  If you do so without the permission of the captain or the government,
[00:13:39.292 --> 00:13:41.573]  That is an invasion and an act of war.
[00:13:41.934 --> 00:13:48.037]  Now the bottom line is that Israel's claims that these humanitarian aid ships were filled with weapons is complete nonsense.
[00:13:48.057 --> 00:13:49.638]  They had no proof of it whatsoever.
[00:13:50.058 --> 00:13:56.002]  The one photo that Israel has put out so far to show the weapons that were found on board the ship...
[00:13:56.897 --> 00:13:59.060]  It's basically wooden poles and kitchen knives.
[00:13:59.941 --> 00:14:09.414]  And Israel is saying these are weapons because the people of Gaza could use them to attack, you know, Israelis, you know, with these ceramic cooking knives and stuff like this.
[00:14:09.494 --> 00:14:13.119]  Well, that's why they said Hatari had weapons of mass destruction.
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:18.462]  I mean weapons of mass destruction are not handguns, but this isn't even handguns.
[00:14:20.163 --> 00:14:21.504]  It's cooking utensils now.
[00:14:21.564 --> 00:14:27.047]  So I guess everybody's got to be nuked because now a cooking knife is a weapon of mass destruction.
[00:14:28.948 --> 00:14:32.030]  ...is now reason to start opening fire on the peace activists.
[00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:39.714]  And the bottom line is, while the world is outraged, I don't think anybody is surprised because Israel is acting true to form.
[00:14:39.774 --> 00:14:43.216]  I mean, robbers will rob, rapists will rape, and Israel commits war crimes.
[00:14:44.096 --> 00:14:52.020]  It's history, but I think what Americans are really angry about right now, and I'm getting this basically when my wife and I went shopping for groceries yesterday.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.561]  We were talking to just the ordinary people in the supermarket.
[00:14:54.901 --> 00:15:00.144]  They were aware of what was going on, and their attitude was, well, we expect Israel to do this.
[00:15:00.444 --> 00:15:02.064]  But they were waiting for the U.S.
[00:15:02.224 --> 00:15:07.265]  government to take some kind of decisive action regarding the nine U.S.
[00:15:07.525 --> 00:15:12.026]  citizens who were kidnapped in international waters by this act of war.
[00:15:12.386 --> 00:15:15.067]  And now we're seeing, you know, the U.S.
[00:15:15.207 --> 00:15:20.968]  once again at the United Nations Security Council is trying to stifle criticism of Israel and is working to protect Israel.
[00:15:21.148 --> 00:15:22.148]  And as far as those U.S.
[00:15:22.188 --> 00:15:25.348]  citizens in Israeli prisons, apparently they're not important.
[00:15:25.648 --> 00:15:26.989]  Now this is a far cry from 1904.
[00:15:28.749 --> 00:15:46.470]  When a businessman named Ion Perdikaris was kidnapped in Morocco by a gentleman by the name of Raisouli and President Theodore Roosevelt sent seven battleships with orders to invade Morocco if Perdikaris was not ultimately returned, which he was.
[00:15:47.231 --> 00:16:07.635]  And I think the American people are wondering whose side is the federal government on, when, I mean, you know, this week we're coming up again on the anniversary of the attack on the USS Liberty, where Israel killed all these American sailors, and then President Johnson not only did not hold Israel to account, but participated in this cover-up of saying, oh, it's just an accident, and so forth and so on.
[00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:10.735]  And we're seeing a repeat of that sellout once again.
[00:16:10.755 --> 00:16:14.076]  And at this point, and I've been saying this this entire election season,
[00:16:14.756 --> 00:16:20.159]  America needs leaders who are going to put America first, second, and third, and a government cannot serve two masters.
[00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:25.502]  If we have a government that is serving Israel, they cannot serve the best interests of the American people.
[00:16:25.762 --> 00:16:32.906]  And you only need to look around at our crumbling infrastructure and our destroyed economy and all the other evils that have descended upon the United States of America
[00:16:33.446 --> 00:16:45.848]  Under the guidance of a government that is still sending money to Israel, even though the British press just published documents proving that Israel is not only a nuclear power, they've been trying to sell nuclear warheads to regimes like apartheid South Africa.
[00:16:46.548 --> 00:16:52.490]  And billions of dollars of our tax money continue to pour into Israel, even though it's illegal to do so under U.S.
[00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.250]  law, because of those nuclear weapons.
[00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.611]  And the American people are starting to say, okay, whose side is the government on?
[00:16:58.831 --> 00:16:59.931]  Let me ask this question.
[00:17:02.267 --> 00:17:14.177]  I mean, the situation with all these countries threatening potential war with Israel, namely Turkey, Turkey says they're going to dispatch warships with the next flotilla that's set to leave in the next day or so.
[00:17:14.678 --> 00:17:17.160]  I mean, is Israel going to attack Turkish warships?
[00:17:18.402 --> 00:17:19.763]  I think they very well might.
[00:17:19.843 --> 00:17:23.185]  I mean, culturally and nationally, Israel is never able to back down.
[00:17:23.205 --> 00:17:25.367]  They're never ever able to admit error.
[00:17:25.447 --> 00:17:39.316]  If they let this next flotilla through to Gaza, and nothing bad happens because of it, then Israel is going to be seen for having been wrong to have imposed such a blockade for the last going on four years, in defiance of a UN resolution, I might add.
[00:17:39.356 --> 00:17:42.678]  The United Nations has repeatedly, including the Security Council,
[00:17:43.118 --> 00:17:46.903]  Called on Israel to lift the blockade, Israel refuses to do so.
[00:17:47.383 --> 00:17:54.792]  And so I think that yes, if Turkey sends armed warships to escort the aid fleet, there may be a shooting war between Israel and Turkey.
[00:17:55.053 --> 00:17:56.595]  And I want to point out one more thing.
[00:17:56.895 --> 00:17:58.537]  Turkey is a member of NATO.
[00:17:58.697 --> 00:17:59.678]  Yes, so is Israel.
[00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.161]  But Israel has attacked a NATO nation.
[00:18:02.842 --> 00:18:09.387]  Over this last weekend, and under the rules of the NATO treaty, an attack on one NATO nation is an attack on them all.
[00:18:09.627 --> 00:18:14.911]  So every member of NATO has been attacked by Israel under the terms of that contract.
[00:18:15.191 --> 00:18:22.817]  I am waiting for the NATO nations, in particular the United States of America, to stand up and say, you are not allowed to attack NATO.
[00:18:24.798 --> 00:18:31.704]  Now, going back here, Mike, I do think though there's spin on both sides because you have the
[00:18:33.473 --> 00:18:44.019]  Pro-Gaza group on the news saying we didn't fight back in any way and it's not true that we were beating people with poles and trying to stab them.
[00:18:44.819 --> 00:18:58.687]  But there are images of people running around with knives and there are images of people beating the commandos on the head with poles and it does, at least at those points, look like the Israelis are being restrained while they're being attacked with poles.
[00:18:58.827 --> 00:18:59.207]  I agree
[00:19:00.268 --> 00:19:01.449]  It's wrong to attack the ships.
[00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.612]  I mean, it's wrong to take them over.
[00:19:03.872 --> 00:19:06.214]  It's wrong to have the blockade to stop them.
[00:19:06.555 --> 00:19:17.026]  My issue is, though, I think the Arabs lose some credibility here when their media puts out that nobody was attacking the commandos, when their own live feeds show it clear as day.
[00:19:17.816 --> 00:19:27.567]  Okay, well I think we're dealing with a problem with the translation, because what the Arab media is saying, Israel claimed that the people on board the aid fleets attacked first.
[00:19:28.047 --> 00:19:34.154]  That the commandos just set foot on the deck, and they weren't doing anything bad, and then the crew of the ship just attacked them.
[00:19:34.294 --> 00:19:39.280]  Now in my point of view, they were justified in attacking the invading force at that point anyway.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:50.308]  What the Arab media is saying is that it wasn't until the Israelis started firing first, that's when the sticks and poles and knives got picked up and the melee basically... Alright, stay there!
[00:19:50.328 --> 00:19:50.869]  Stay there!
[00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:51.409]  We got a break.
[00:19:51.469 --> 00:19:53.211]  Let's come back and cover all that.
[00:19:53.231 --> 00:19:55.272]  On the other side with Mike Rivero.

[00:21:59.463 --> 00:22:05.688]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:06.148 --> 00:22:13.914]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:14.254 --> 00:22:22.140]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:27.184]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.

[00:24:13.868 --> 00:24:31.351]  Well, Mike brings up the central point that I've made several times in the first hour, and watching that one live feed that got out that's been on Al Jazeera, Press TV, Fox, CNN, hundreds of, you know, different local TV stations, scores of international networks, and we're going to continue to roll.
[00:24:32.092 --> 00:24:57.455]  uh... that in the background effect all probably but just just play one of the reports uh... you know unedited uh... coming up because we've got some a clips here that are from start to finish with the press tv reporters and others uh... out on the deck and you do hear banging and exploding uh... in the minutes and seconds before the boarding and and and that actually fits uh... with how ships are normally boarded during a blockade
[00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:03.237]  They fire tear gas, they fire flashbangs, they fire across the bow, the ship won't stop.
[00:25:05.734 --> 00:25:14.000]  Then the ship finally gets scared, it runs the flag up, and the Arabs and the pro-Palestinian group, they say, yeah, we ran the white flag up.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:20.405]  Then the Israeli commandos come down because the ship has surrendered, and then the people attack them.
[00:25:21.165 --> 00:25:30.252]  So there's no doubt that the Israelis attack the ship with flashbangs and with tear gas.
[00:25:31.974 --> 00:25:33.055]  But the big issue is,
[00:25:33.775 --> 00:25:37.278]  And the problem is Israel has the ships and can cover this up.
[00:25:38.079 --> 00:25:42.923]  If Israel fired real ammunition into the ship, there is no doubt this was illegal.
[00:25:43.243 --> 00:25:43.784]  Mike Rivera?
[00:25:44.923 --> 00:25:50.249]  Well, you need to remember that what Israel calls a rubber bullet is not what the United States calls a rubber bullet.
[00:25:50.289 --> 00:25:56.435]  The Israeli rubber bullets still have steel cores, and they are lethal at close distance.
[00:25:56.736 --> 00:26:05.866]  And the bottom line here is, again, Israel can make up any statements it wants about why it wants to stop the aid fleet, but they have never ever once
[00:26:06.306 --> 00:26:09.468]  found any evidence of weapons going into Gaza.
[00:26:09.528 --> 00:26:17.032]  The ship was carrying construction supplies to repair the damage from cast lead, was carrying food, medical supplies, crayons, toys for the kids.
[00:26:17.473 --> 00:26:21.515]  All of these ships' cargos were inspected at their ports of departure.
[00:26:22.035 --> 00:26:26.738]  Israel is basically throwing a tantrum and saying, you have to do what we tell you to do anywhere in the world.
[00:26:27.178 --> 00:26:34.923]  And you need to remember, Israel doesn't have the legal authority to issue orders to ships flying foreign flags in international waters.
[00:26:35.805 --> 00:26:46.668]  And again, Israel is just, you know, making up these stories to justify continuing this blockade of Gaza, to try and starve the Gazan people into leaving, because Israel covets their land.
[00:26:46.868 --> 00:26:49.809]  This has been the agenda for the last four years.
[00:26:50.169 --> 00:26:55.090]  Israel is putting out all this propaganda to justify what is, in essence, unjustifiable.
[00:26:55.330 --> 00:27:00.831]  They're still coming out with this canard that Hamas took control of Gaza with a violent coup.
[00:27:00.871 --> 00:27:01.272]  They didn't.
[00:27:01.352 --> 00:27:02.812]  Hamas won the election.
[00:27:03.152 --> 00:27:10.876]  But Israel doesn't want to admit the election happened anymore because Israel believes in democracy only when their people can win.
[00:27:11.136 --> 00:27:21.482]  And they support the Palestinian Authority because the Palestinian Authority is so far basically just rolling over and allowing the West Bank settlements to continue and allow the encroachment of more land grab.
[00:27:23.703 --> 00:27:27.824]  And basically what is left of Palestine is dissolving before the eyes of the Palestinian people.
[00:27:28.184 --> 00:27:31.305]  All of this is in defiance of United Nations resolutions.
[00:27:31.605 --> 00:27:42.928]  And I remember back in 2003 when we were sending our young men and women to go in and attack Iraq over weapons of mass destruction that Israel claimed they had and they didn't have them.
[00:27:43.608 --> 00:27:47.951]  We were being told that the reason we were doing this was because Iraq was defying the United Nations.
[00:27:48.491 --> 00:27:50.853]  Well, now we have Israel defying the United Nations.
[00:27:50.933 --> 00:27:52.354]  And what does the United States government do?
[00:27:52.394 --> 00:27:56.897]  They stand up in the Security Council and say, oh, we can't criticize Israel for what they did.
[00:27:57.738 --> 00:28:05.623]  And it's just, it's, it's, it's angering to see the government of the United States of America so much supportive of the government of Israel.
[00:28:05.643 --> 00:28:06.463]  Well, let me ask this.
[00:28:06.784 --> 00:28:10.466]  What's going to happen when the Turks send warships in?
[00:28:10.486 --> 00:28:12.948]  I mean, is Israel going to attack them?
[00:28:13.928 --> 00:28:15.549]  I think Israel very well might.
[00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:17.230]  Israel cannot admit error.
[00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.651]  They cannot back down.
[00:28:18.991 --> 00:28:29.737]  I think there's going to be a confrontation at sea and the whole region may blow up because Syria and Lebanon and all these other countries are saying Israel has started a new regional war.
[00:28:29.997 --> 00:28:31.037]  And now you just said it.
[00:28:31.077 --> 00:28:31.718]  You just said it.
[00:28:32.078 --> 00:28:33.098]  Perfect timing.
[00:28:33.658 --> 00:28:39.200]  In Asia, we've got the Korea blow-up between North and South with a torpedo, which is very suspicious.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.260]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.661]  Separately, you've got the Middle East blowing up.
[00:28:42.681 --> 00:28:45.962]  You've got Iraq setting fire again.
[00:28:46.022 --> 00:28:49.123]  You've got escalations in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[00:28:51.349 --> 00:29:01.615]  As the central banks collapse Europe and the United States, right as the G20 is openly announcing the birth of world government, magically the wars start.
[00:29:02.115 --> 00:29:19.446]  Mike, how many times have we talked about last year that they're going to have to have wars, and the Rand Corporation said two years ago that they need wars all over the planet to bring in the world government, and that only a new world war can do it, and it looks like it's being delivered on a silver platter.
[00:29:20.185 --> 00:29:32.327]  Yes, by Israel, and we need to keep that in mind here, because one of the problems we have with all of our previous wars are that the nations that really start them very often skip out sideways and the blame falls on a third party.
[00:29:32.747 --> 00:29:37.388]  And we need to remember, Israel is the author of this new global disaster.
[00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:41.389]  Well, they let past-age ships in.
[00:29:41.809 --> 00:29:43.070]  Why did they stop this?
[00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.110]  We'll be right back with Mike Rivera.
[00:29:49.855 --> 00:29:52.844]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.786 --> 00:29:56.474]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.228 --> 00:30:04.149]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:04.489 --> 00:30:08.191]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:08.371 --> 00:30:10.653]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:10.833 --> 00:30:16.096]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:16.537 --> 00:30:22.781]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:23.181 --> 00:30:28.746]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:29.166 --> 00:30:32.829]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:30:33.349 --> 00:30:37.353]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:37.633 --> 00:30:43.538]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:43.578 --> 00:30:46.560]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:47.141 --> 00:30:48.582]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:49.122 --> 00:30:49.563]  It's here.

[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.520]  Others don't.

[00:33:03.278 --> 00:33:11.262]  They don't want to see us do the night.
[00:33:11.562 --> 00:33:13.804]  All they want us to do is
[00:33:14.924 --> 00:33:16.604]  Your calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:16.684 --> 00:33:20.965]  Mike Rivero is our guest, and I can't say I really can argue with anything he's saying.
[00:33:37.802 --> 00:33:41.624]  I just want to expand on this because this is not happening by accident now.
[00:33:42.344 --> 00:34:01.755]  I looked it up yesterday and there have been no fewer than 20 aid convoys, generally smaller ships though, that Israel has openly let come in, carrying medicine, toys, construction supplies, things of that nature, educational supplies.
[00:34:02.455 --> 00:34:06.778]  Why did they decide to stop this one when it was coming out of Turkey?
[00:34:08.124 --> 00:34:10.005]  And why is this coming now?
[00:34:11.726 --> 00:34:18.549]  And we're also going to get into attacks on free speech here in the United States, and as I said, take some of your phone calls.
[00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:27.633]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:28.353 --> 00:34:32.695]  Before we go back to Mike Rivera, we're carrying a new film that is very important.
[00:34:34.015 --> 00:34:37.157]  If the population is not educated about our true form of government,
[00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:42.706]  And about the fact that it's our right and our duty under the 9th and 10th Amendment to take back our government.
[00:34:44.168 --> 00:34:47.432]  Then we have no hope of ever reversing the globalist takeover.
[00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:53.781]  It's a private, offshore, corporate takeover of the United States, simply put.
[00:34:55.502 --> 00:35:07.645]  And the film by Gary Franchi and William Lewis, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, has Michael Bagnerich, RJ Harris, myself, Evan Vieira, Richard Mack, Cynthia Davis, Charles Key, and many, many others.
[00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:10.566]  And it's so important that everyone see this film.
[00:35:13.787 --> 00:35:16.228]  It's one thing to know we have a corrupt, out-of-control government.
[00:35:16.308 --> 00:35:17.928]  It's another thing to know how to take it back.
[00:35:17.968 --> 00:35:20.029]  And this is a big part of the solution.
[00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:24.170]  What kind of government did the Founding Fathers intend for us
[00:35:25.387 --> 00:35:26.847]  When they struggled to form this nation.
[00:35:27.388 --> 00:35:29.628]  Did they seek another form of suppressive rule?
[00:35:30.148 --> 00:35:33.049]  Did they envision an enslaved population with few liberties?
[00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:43.192]  Don't Tread on Me gives the viewer a look into the minds of our forefathers and the legislation written to protect each and every one of us from a tyrannical government.
[00:35:43.752 --> 00:35:52.675]  Don't Tread on Me discusses the government's overuse of the Commerce Clause, the suppressed and ignored states' rights issue,
[00:35:58.206 --> 00:36:10.810]  Don't Tread On Me discusses the government's overuse of Commerce Clause, the suppressed and ignored states' rights issue, defined sovereignty, the proper role of government, a constitutional militia, and much more.
[00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:20.133]  Don't Tread On Me offers sound solutions to take back rights stolen from our out-of-control despotic federal government.
[00:36:23.567 --> 00:36:26.972]  Rights stolen from the American people by our out-of-control despotic federal government.
[00:36:27.633 --> 00:36:29.276]  It is such an important film to see.
[00:36:29.316 --> 00:36:30.978]  Again, don't tread on me.
[00:36:30.998 --> 00:36:31.940]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:37.107]  And of course, there's a new film we produced, Jason Mermis directed, Invisible Empire, New Order Defined.
[00:36:38.812 --> 00:36:47.021]  And it just covers the history of the New World Order, what they're into, how they operate, the crimes they've committed, and over a hundred clips of them calling for world government, New World Order.
[00:36:47.342 --> 00:36:52.627]  For somebody that wants a general overview of these people and who's been living in denial, a very important film for people to see.
[00:36:52.968 --> 00:36:54.329]  Again, available at InfoWars.com.
[00:36:57.361 --> 00:37:01.647]  Or you can simply call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:37:02.108 --> 00:37:07.035]  And you can see both of these films in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:07.916 --> 00:37:12.703]  You can also see coming up on Wednesday, Camp FEMA.
[00:37:13.564 --> 00:37:15.345]  At PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:15.365 --> 00:37:19.386]  We've been authorized to upload it there for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:37:19.886 --> 00:37:22.247]  Okay, Mike Rivero, thanks for holding there during that break.
[00:37:22.967 --> 00:37:32.390]  Going back to you, you were bringing up the fact that Israel is starting this World War III, or potentially is, separately
[00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:37.312]  What do you see happening on the Korean Peninsula?
[00:37:37.552 --> 00:37:45.775]  I know you've written about that at WhatReallyHappened.com and we have quite a few reports, even with the Chinese government and others saying this could be a provocation.
[00:37:46.396 --> 00:37:53.298]  It looks to be a German torpedo, not a Chinese torpedo that we know the North has.
[00:37:54.099 --> 00:37:57.820]  Kibono, who benefits, why would the North stage something like this?
[00:37:59.801 --> 00:38:01.907]  We see Japan wanting U.S.
[00:38:01.947 --> 00:38:05.477]  forces out, now backing away from that as soon as this happened.
[00:38:07.076 --> 00:38:20.204]  Well, basically, I think we can all agree that, you know, even though Kim Jong-il sometimes issues some very questionable statements, and his taste in sunglasses is definitely to be questioned, South Korea is stupid enough to do something like this.
[00:38:20.324 --> 00:38:30.431]  And if you look at exactly where this sinking took place, where it's deep inside South Korean waters, inside the middle of an ongoing military exercise involving three
[00:38:30.811 --> 00:38:32.312]  Top of the line U.S.
[00:38:32.593 --> 00:38:39.479]  warships, guided missile destroyers, Ticonderogas and Arleigh Burks, and they are very well equipped for anti-submarine warfare.
[00:38:39.859 --> 00:38:52.310]  So the idea that one of those clunky, noisy North Korean submarines could scoot across the demarcation line, get into the middle of this ongoing exercise, flip off a torpedo at this warship, and then get out.
[00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:55.252]  Without being detected is absolutely ludicrous.
[00:38:55.712 --> 00:39:09.982]  Now, when they were holding up the blueprints of the North Korean torpedo that they claimed that they'd found the remains of, if you study it very carefully and you look at the torpedo itself and the blueprints, they're not the same weapon because of the location of the fin actuators within the structure.
[00:39:10.002 --> 00:39:17.527]  There's a bunch of other differences as well, but I am absolutely convinced that what they found on the floor of the ocean is not that North Korean torpedo design.
[00:39:17.807 --> 00:39:21.150]  As you point out, the metallurgy suggests it's one of the German torpedoes,
[00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:24.692]  Well, who's got German subs and is running around trying to start wars?
[00:39:25.092 --> 00:39:25.492]  Israel!
[00:39:25.592 --> 00:39:31.075]  In fact, three of their German-built dolphin submarines are now sailing off the coast of Iran.
[00:39:31.335 --> 00:39:35.077]  They're openly acknowledged to be carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles.
[00:39:35.617 --> 00:39:38.419]  We know that they're operating all the way out to the Pacific.
[00:39:38.999 --> 00:39:48.063]  And, you know, Israel likes to start wars, and so what better way than to go out and flip off a torpedo, sink this North Korean warship in the U.S.
[00:39:48.103 --> 00:39:53.825]  and Israel, and everybody else says, oh, I'm sorry, sink the South Korean warship and blame it on North Korea.
[00:39:54.345 --> 00:39:55.086]  It's like the U.S.
[00:39:55.166 --> 00:40:03.349]  is Maine all over again, or the Gulf of Tonkin, and now China and Russia are both backing off and saying they're not convinced that North Korea had anything to do with this.
[00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:07.471]  They're very suspicious that this is another classic... Well, I mean, Mike, look,
[00:40:09.346 --> 00:40:22.061]  I mean, I can see this being a German torpedo, and I can see the West wanting to stay on the Korean Peninsula as part of the encirclement of China, and that's part of the stated Pentagon doctrine.
[00:40:22.821 --> 00:40:28.648]  But Israel, in a medium-range submarine, and we know they do buy these German torpedoes,
[00:40:31.573 --> 00:40:37.618]  I don't think that's enough evidence, but you can correct me if I'm wrong, to point at Israel.
[00:40:37.658 --> 00:40:43.002]  I don't think Israel is the progenitor and the source of every form of evil on earth.
[00:40:44.233 --> 00:40:52.957]  No, but I mean, we just saw them open fire on, you know, a harmless aid convoy over the weekend and killed, apparently, the death counts now up to 20 people.
[00:40:53.518 --> 00:41:00.501]  And the bottom line is, if you go back and look at the USS Liberty, they attacked that ship with the goal of tricking the United States into war on Egypt.
[00:41:00.821 --> 00:41:01.862]  Look at the Levon Affair.
[00:41:02.142 --> 00:41:02.863]  The same thing.
[00:41:02.923 --> 00:41:12.591]  Israeli agents were caught blowing up British and American targets in Egypt, again, to destroy diplomatic relations between the West and Egypt, to try and trip up another war.
[00:41:13.051 --> 00:41:15.813]  USS Cole may have been in more of the same situation.
[00:41:15.893 --> 00:41:18.656]  I mean, the bottom line is, look at the model of the Mossad.
[00:41:18.696 --> 00:41:21.138]  By way of deception, thou shalt do war.
[00:41:21.798 --> 00:41:37.396]  And again, you know, we already know that those Israeli submarines have been operating in the West Pacific because they had an incident a few years ago where they accidentally rammed a Japanese ship and tried to evade responsibility for that and then they were forced to turn around and admit that, yeah, that was us and we're sorry and everything.
[00:41:38.957 --> 00:41:43.600]  Again, Israel itself is such a small nation, they project power through covert means.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:52.484]  And we don't know who was out there, but I'm basically saying we shouldn't leak to conclusions and believe the first thing the corporate media tells us about the North Korean situation.
[00:41:52.904 --> 00:41:57.066]  Again, North Korea doesn't want a restart of the Korean War.
[00:41:57.606 --> 00:41:59.307]  No, listen, Mike, I hear you.
[00:41:59.567 --> 00:42:04.388]  And it is starting to point towards false flag over in the Pacific.
[00:42:05.969 --> 00:42:08.230]  They're south of China on the Korean Peninsula.
[00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:11.951]  And you're right, Israel admits to the Levanth Affair.
[00:42:12.631 --> 00:42:26.821]  The NSA declassified two years ago, Chicago Tribune, that all the admirals, and I literally had them all on, they're almost all dead now, what they said was the truth about what happened with the USS Liberty.
[00:42:26.881 --> 00:42:28.102]  So that's confirmed.
[00:42:28.922 --> 00:42:29.403]  It's just...
[00:42:30.635 --> 00:42:37.517]  How would Israel stand to gain starting a potential war, even nuclear, in the Pacific?
[00:42:37.737 --> 00:42:38.937]  What, drawing the U.S.
[00:42:38.997 --> 00:42:43.018]  away so that they could then have their own war with Iran?
[00:42:43.218 --> 00:42:53.280]  Or what's the... I mean, I guess that's what the big banking establishment wants, is they do want a big global war, so through that crisis they can establish their world government.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.423]  We know Israel's part and parcel of that, so is the U.S.
[00:42:57.083 --> 00:42:57.924]  and the EU.
[00:42:58.705 --> 00:43:04.691]  It's just that even from my research, it's hard to believe they're all working in concert that closely.
[00:43:04.751 --> 00:43:07.194]  But I guess that's where the evidence points.
[00:43:07.274 --> 00:43:10.437]  But clearly there's elements of our own Navy SEALs.
[00:43:10.998 --> 00:43:14.461]  I mean, we know it came out in the New Yorker magazine on MSNBC.
[00:43:15.562 --> 00:43:19.046]  Uh, that Cy Hirsch reported that Cheney wanted to have U.S.
[00:43:19.526 --> 00:43:21.028]  troops attack U.S.
[00:43:21.068 --> 00:43:24.231]  ships to blame it on Iran three years ago, three and a half years ago.
[00:43:24.251 --> 00:43:30.477]  Uh, so, I mean, my only issue is there are other suspects that do stage some terror.
[00:43:30.517 --> 00:43:34.441]  I mean, uh, I mean, is there any evidence Israel was involved in the Gulf of Tonkin?
[00:43:35.302 --> 00:43:37.004]  Well, absolutely not.
[00:43:37.024 --> 00:43:45.794]  The Gulf of Tonkin began with an inexperienced sonar operator hearing his own ship's propellers, and Johnson knew that it was an erroneous report when he went to Congress with it.
[00:43:46.154 --> 00:43:48.557]  But to getting back to the Korean situation, first of all,
[00:43:50.259 --> 00:43:55.143]  Even though we're suggesting that Israel might have been involved there, I'm not saying that they were acting unilaterally or alone.
[00:43:55.223 --> 00:43:56.324]  We know that the U.S.
[00:43:56.804 --> 00:44:01.548]  and Israeli intelligence services team up together on some of these various operations.
[00:44:01.908 --> 00:44:15.358]  Now, if North Korea and South Korea restart their war, and that starts dragging resources in from China and Russia, that is going to take some of the potential for support on Iran's side away when the Iran war cranks up.
[00:44:15.638 --> 00:44:19.824]  Remember, the biggest fear right now is that if Israel launches a war with Iran and the U.S.
[00:44:19.844 --> 00:44:24.632]  gets dragged into it, that Russia and China will at least logistically be supporting Iran.
[00:44:25.092 --> 00:44:31.122]  But if they're tied up in a new war over in the Korean Peninsula, that is less support they're going to be able to send to Iran.
[00:44:31.522 --> 00:44:36.546]  And it's always been that logistical support that has been what is preventing war with Iran.
[00:44:36.786 --> 00:44:38.807]  That's why they're trying to keep Afghanistan torn up.
[00:44:39.007 --> 00:44:47.714]  That's why they're trying to get Georgia into a whole new war to close those tunnels through the Caucasus Mountains, is to prevent the resupply of Iran from Russia.
[00:44:49.721 --> 00:44:52.563]  Well, you make some really good points and time will tell.
[00:44:53.563 --> 00:45:06.030]  But regardless, we know that the power structure has stated that they want more than just a regional war, bigger than Iraq, as a global distraction to bring in this global banking dictatorship.
[00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:18.117]  And so I find it very suspect that all of this, all these different kickoffs for more regional tension and nuclear war is just suddenly sprouting up and popping up everywhere.
[00:45:19.286 --> 00:45:19.907]  And you're right.
[00:45:20.387 --> 00:45:35.879]  If Russia and China are drawn off with the situation on the Korean Peninsula, that makes it a lot easier for Israel, who is openly saying, I mean, for those who just tuned in, the last month Netanyahu has said three or four times, we may go ahead and nuke Iran at any time.
[00:45:36.639 --> 00:45:44.906]  They're trying to pass sanctions to blockade all trade into Iran, which is an act of war, according to the Geneva Convention, and Ron Paul's on record with that.
[00:45:45.766 --> 00:45:49.470]  So there's no doubt that things are just going to get a lot more hairy.
[00:45:49.951 --> 00:45:51.973]  What are you worried about next, Mike?
[00:45:52.013 --> 00:45:54.916]  What shoe are you looking for to drop next?
[00:45:56.212 --> 00:46:05.798]  Well, as you point out, we have got way too many of the world leaders and world financial leaders and world political leaders who see their own personal fortunes being improved by a new major war.
[00:46:06.339 --> 00:46:22.950]  I think back about this wonderful movie called The International, and the storyline is basically that this large international bank is caught engaging in weapons trafficking, covert weapons trafficking, and the investigator says to the bank, why do you care if thus and such a country wins their war?
[00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:24.751]  And the bank says, oh, we don't care if they win it.
[00:46:25.231 --> 00:46:27.533]  It's just war creates debt on both sides.
[00:46:27.593 --> 00:46:33.537]  So we're going to start wars because it's good for our banking business and we don't care which side wins or loses because both sides go into debt.
[00:46:34.078 --> 00:46:37.040]  And if you look back at our own history in the United States, the U.S.
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:43.645]  government got out of the crash of 1907 by getting us into World War I. They got out of the crash of 1929 by getting us into World War II.
[00:46:43.985 --> 00:46:51.130]  Here we are in the throes of the crash of 2007 and look how hard our government is trying to start wars with anybody at all.
[00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:52.451]  It almost doesn't even matter.
[00:46:52.771 --> 00:47:01.023]  I'm almost reminded of Michael Moore's wonderful film Canadian Bacon where America declares war on Canada just because they need a war and they can't find anybody else to fight with.
[00:47:02.352 --> 00:47:15.139]  Well, that's another great point you've made, and we now have open discussions of attacks on Iran, which is just completely illegal.
[00:47:15.399 --> 00:47:25.324]  And going back to last week, Mike, Iran says we'll give our uranium to foreign countries like Brazil or France or Turkey.
[00:47:25.384 --> 00:47:25.845]  You pick.
[00:47:26.745 --> 00:47:33.192]  And that way it'll be enriched to a level that can't be used in weapons, and then the stance gets even more anti-Iran.
[00:47:33.613 --> 00:47:36.936]  I mean, Iran at many levels really has tried detente.
[00:47:38.738 --> 00:47:40.220]  Have you heard about the Lulu letter?
[00:47:41.581 --> 00:47:42.763]  Yes, but tell folks about it.
[00:47:43.453 --> 00:48:13.037]  Okay, well basically in a nutshell, this is a letter that was leaked out and exposed the fact that the United States knew that Turkey and Brazil were negotiating with Iran over a uranium swap, but that the United States gave its approval for the negotiations in the expectation that it would fail, and then they would have one more thing to use to say we need to go to war with Iran, because look, Brazil and Turkey tried to talk to Iran and Iran wouldn't listen, and Iran surprised them by saying, yeah, this is a deal we can live with.
[00:48:13.417 --> 00:48:14.318]  And so now the U.S.
[00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:15.038]  is in a panic.
[00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:17.400]  They're trying to find some way to derail the situation.
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.581]  Hillary's out there screaming about sanctions.
[00:48:19.641 --> 00:48:20.261]  It's too little.
[00:48:20.301 --> 00:48:20.882]  It's too late.
[00:48:21.242 --> 00:48:23.043]  Because it's not about the sanctions.
[00:48:23.163 --> 00:48:24.264]  It's not about the uranium.
[00:48:24.304 --> 00:48:25.444]  It's not about nuclear weapons.
[00:48:25.564 --> 00:48:29.087]  It is about selling the American people yet another war.
[00:48:29.967 --> 00:48:32.729]  on Israel's enemies in the Mideast.
[00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:40.456]  We've got suckered into Iraq, we're being suckered into Iran, they're trying to go into Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, everywhere.
[00:48:41.177 --> 00:48:44.139]  Have we invaded enough countries yet to qualify as a world war?
[00:48:44.439 --> 00:48:45.500]  Well, have you seen the
[00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:53.554]  Well, yes, if these conflicts stay ignited, it will be a world war by every definition.
[00:48:53.614 --> 00:48:55.834]  It's going to be in more than two regions simultaneously.
[00:48:56.595 --> 00:48:59.796]  But going back, have you seen the new video out today?
[00:48:59.816 --> 00:49:03.658]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com of Oliver Stone interviewing the former
[00:49:04.478 --> 00:49:09.003]  Argentine president who said he met with Bush and Bush said we must have more wars.
[00:49:09.504 --> 00:49:11.706]  Everyone must be taught to kneel before us.
[00:49:12.146 --> 00:49:13.788]  This is great for our economy.
[00:49:14.429 --> 00:49:16.451]  But yeah, great for the banker's economy.
[00:49:16.711 --> 00:49:19.334]  They're all making record bonuses while we go bankrupt.
[00:49:20.492 --> 00:49:21.873]  Yeah, it absolutely is.
[00:49:21.933 --> 00:49:30.860]  I mean, if you look at the reality of how much of our gross national product is put into building things that kill people, then you'll realize that the United States is not a nation of peace.
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:32.301]  It is a nation of war.
[00:49:32.761 --> 00:49:43.810]  Murder and mass murder and killing is the business of the United States, and it has been all the more so over the last 30 years, where our manufacturing of the items of peace has basically been given away to other countries.
[00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:49.194]  And the only thing the United States seems to manufacture anymore is trouble and death on a large scale.
[00:49:51.121 --> 00:49:56.584]  Well, people need to understand that the globalists at the top are apolitical.
[00:49:56.824 --> 00:49:57.925]  It's all about power.
[00:49:57.985 --> 00:49:59.866]  It's about playing groups off against each other.
[00:50:00.567 --> 00:50:10.353]  And the world population has such an elementary understanding of this that it makes them just fair game, like legless chickens being eaten by foxes.
[00:50:10.993 --> 00:50:18.061]  But, Zbigniew Brzezinski said two weeks ago that for the first time the world has awoken to the true power structure.
[00:50:18.321 --> 00:50:21.825]  We're not distracted by presidents and prime ministers anymore that come and go.
[00:50:22.165 --> 00:50:25.729]  We're now looking at the real power structure, and he said the elite are in trouble.
[00:50:26.329 --> 00:50:27.230]  Did you see that video?
[00:50:28.111 --> 00:50:32.916]  Yes I did, and I also read about the comment that Brzezinski did, which is absolutely right.
[00:50:34.741 --> 00:50:37.163]  Well, I'll tell you what, Mike, your audio's cutting out there a bit.
[00:50:37.183 --> 00:50:40.426]  Let's come back and get your take on that on the other side.
[00:50:40.446 --> 00:50:47.351]  Then we're going to give you for one more segment after that so we can talk to Ted, Eddie, Joseph, Keith, Jimmy, and others.
[00:50:47.371 --> 00:50:58.821]  And we'll continue with your calls into the next hour with a bunch of other important news as we continue to cover the tragic events in the Mediterranean with the boarding of these aid vessels.
[00:50:59.773 --> 00:51:01.014]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:01.074 --> 00:51:06.418]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:06.658 --> 00:51:11.282]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:11.682 --> 00:51:12.082]  It's true.
[00:51:12.142 --> 00:51:14.724]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:51:14.965 --> 00:51:16.706]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:51:17.246 --> 00:51:21.930]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:29.396]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:29.576 --> 00:51:30.477]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:30.697 --> 00:51:37.002]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:51:37.375 --> 00:51:40.217]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:40.557 --> 00:51:42.458]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[00:51:43.579 --> 00:51:43.839]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:43.879 --> 00:51:46.861]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:47.361 --> 00:51:49.102]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:59.784 --> 00:52:02.827]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:52:03.167 --> 00:52:06.770]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:52:07.071 --> 00:52:10.534]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:17.500]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:17.880]  I think so.

[00:52:59.521 --> 00:53:08.847]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[00:53:09.027 --> 00:53:10.028]  My name is Crystal.
[00:53:10.368 --> 00:53:12.950]  I'm a 45 year old and live in Houston, Texas.
[00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:15.832]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse.
[00:53:16.332 --> 00:53:16.892]  10 years ago.
[00:53:17.252 --> 00:53:21.274]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[00:53:21.394 --> 00:53:22.214]  What did Crystal do?
[00:53:22.234 --> 00:53:25.855]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[00:53:26.175 --> 00:53:32.478]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[00:53:32.598 --> 00:53:36.199]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.521]  Alright, let's go to some of your phone calls here.
[00:53:44.561 --> 00:53:45.741]  Let's talk to Ted in Texas.
[00:53:45.781 --> 00:53:47.441]  Ted, you're on the air with Mike Rivera.
[00:53:47.681 --> 00:53:48.421]  Go ahead.
[00:54:10.677 --> 00:54:11.618]  Hello, Mike and Alex.
[00:54:12.278 --> 00:54:14.961]  Are we specifically talking about the events in the Middle East?
[00:54:15.061 --> 00:54:16.022]  You can talk about whatever you want.
[00:54:16.042 --> 00:54:16.402]  Go ahead.
[00:54:17.063 --> 00:54:19.325]  Okay, I've been working on this story.
[00:54:19.425 --> 00:54:20.926]  It's a local story for Austin.
[00:54:20.946 --> 00:54:28.093]  Basically, the headline is, Austin welcomes Formula One, ignores own climate protection plan.
[00:54:29.042 --> 00:54:38.948]  Oh yeah, they want citizens to pay 25 million dollars for this stupid racetrack that'll lose money but it'll lie in the pockets of the local establishment.
[00:54:39.268 --> 00:54:41.949]  Look, the environmental movement is only about stealing property.
[00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:47.152]  The SOS, I'm going to put you on hold until after Mike's gone, and then we can come back and talk about this.
[00:54:47.172 --> 00:54:52.716]  You know, the cover of the Chronicle is, oh, locals team up with the EPA to fight the death of the earth.
[00:54:53.416 --> 00:55:01.259]  The local environmental movement in Austin is about stealing farms and ranches, and they literally then build hotels on whatever they steal.
[00:55:01.559 --> 00:55:03.360]  They are a group of vicious criminals.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.662]  Mike Rivero, a quick comment on Al Gore's wife is leaving him after 40 years.
[00:55:09.862 --> 00:55:13.604]  Do you think it's because he's been so politically destroyed by Climategate?
[00:55:14.504 --> 00:55:14.844]  I don't know.
[00:55:14.884 --> 00:55:16.425]  Maybe it was just a fit of good taste.
[00:55:19.261 --> 00:55:23.243]  Or maybe he's picking up too many pick-up basketball games with Obama.
[00:55:24.284 --> 00:55:25.084]  Could very well be.
[00:55:25.404 --> 00:55:27.105]  You know, reportedly what's going on at those.
[00:55:27.925 --> 00:55:29.806]  Let's talk to Eddie in New Hampshire.
[00:55:30.386 --> 00:55:31.787]  Eddie, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:55:31.807 --> 00:55:33.428]  Hi Alex, hi Mike.
[00:55:35.008 --> 00:55:40.531]  You already covered much of what my question was to be about, but I just wanted to know, why provoke Turkey?
[00:55:41.931 --> 00:55:45.273]  Why in the world would they want to provoke Turkey, a country that's just on the sidelines?
[00:55:45.893 --> 00:55:47.314]  Is it to accelerate the process?
[00:55:49.013 --> 00:55:49.934]  That's a good question.
[00:55:49.974 --> 00:55:51.136]  No, I mean, this is bold.
[00:55:51.957 --> 00:56:01.609]  Israel openly, and Turkey's saying this could cause war, and they're going to send ships in, and then if Israel attacks those Turkish ships, how are they going to spend that?
[00:56:01.629 --> 00:56:02.309]  Mike Rivera.
[00:56:03.223 --> 00:56:04.625]  Well, a couple of things to keep in mind.
[00:56:04.725 --> 00:56:14.375]  Even though Turkey is nominally an Israeli ally, about a year ago, the Mossad was caught as part of a plot to assassinate Erdogan, Turkey's leader.
[00:56:15.036 --> 00:56:19.862]  And a little piece of irony that people have not picked up on too much yet, as of this morning,
[00:56:20.322 --> 00:56:25.727]  The chairmanship of the United Nations Security Council has passed to Turkey.
[00:56:26.068 --> 00:56:33.535]  So now Turkey gets to set the agenda in the Security Council and I think payback is not going to be very pleasant for Israel at this point.
[00:56:34.035 --> 00:56:36.418]  I don't know what Israel was thinking
[00:56:36.978 --> 00:56:56.667]  I think that they had this idea that absent the live video feed that got out from the fleet, that they were probably going to stage something to make it look like the Free Gaza Movement really was running weapons into Hamas or something that would silence world criticism, but they didn't get to pull that part of it off.
[00:56:57.547 --> 00:57:03.795]  And, you know, certainly right now, Israel is not allowing the media to talk to any of the prisoners taken from the ship.
[00:57:04.095 --> 00:57:07.640]  They're only being allowed very, very brief connections with their voice.
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:08.321]  Well, I'll say this.
[00:57:08.361 --> 00:57:13.347]  You're going to see more and more, and police departments are actually buying these, jamming of broadband.
[00:57:13.687 --> 00:57:25.955]  When they run an operation, because the power that you can have an iPhone and have it streamed to a remote location, and that the police can't confiscate your videotape, that is devastating corrupt governments everywhere.
[00:57:26.056 --> 00:57:36.262]  I've seen three new videos today of police attacking and brutalizing camera people in the US, but they had remote feeds so the cops don't get it.
[00:57:36.683 --> 00:57:37.904]  So, I mean, it's...
[00:57:38.744 --> 00:57:42.288]  They're still in the old game of being able to beat you up and take your video camera.
[00:57:42.528 --> 00:57:43.589]  That isn't working anymore.
[00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:45.191]  People just go to live feed.
[00:57:47.173 --> 00:57:55.042]  And the other thing, of course, is I think both you and I have a sponsor that makes the little DigiPen and DigiGlasses with the camcorders built inside.
[00:57:55.362 --> 00:57:56.663]  People are starting to use those.
[00:57:56.703 --> 00:57:57.945]  The police don't even know they're there.
[00:57:59.428 --> 00:58:02.671]  Yeah, I just wanted to know, is there anything that Israel can do or will do where we just won't back them up?
[00:58:19.011 --> 00:58:23.293]  I mean, is there a line that they'll cross that the United States will just say, enough?
[00:58:23.313 --> 00:58:23.353]  No!
[00:58:23.793 --> 00:58:30.076]  No, the United States says they're going to back a premeditated first strike with nuclear weapons on Tehran.
[00:58:30.556 --> 00:58:37.018]  And so you're talking at least hundreds of thousands dead, and if Iran fights back in any way, it will be called terrorism.
[00:58:37.379 --> 00:58:38.219]  You will be nuked.
[00:58:38.239 --> 00:58:39.239]  You will die and love it.
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:44.341]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.361 --> 00:58:46.142]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.738 --> 00:58:52.359]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:52.759 --> 00:58:57.720]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.821]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:00.121 --> 00:59:04.942]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:05.122 --> 00:59:06.103]  How much do you want?
[00:59:06.323 --> 00:59:07.063]  When do you want it?
[00:59:07.443 --> 00:59:09.044]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:09.324 --> 00:59:10.144]  When will you need it?
[00:59:10.404 --> 00:59:12.465]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:12.605 --> 00:59:13.585]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:13.925 --> 00:59:17.846]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[00:59:18.006 --> 00:59:20.527]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:20.727 --> 00:59:23.908]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:24.308 --> 00:59:27.809]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:28.129 --> 00:59:29.110]  How much will you need?
[00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:29.970]  We don't know.
[00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:31.170]  How much do you want?
[00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:32.091]  All you can get.
[00:59:32.291 --> 00:59:33.091]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:33.391 --> 00:59:36.132]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:36.432 --> 00:59:36.772]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:36.953 --> 00:59:38.613]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:38.633 --> 00:59:39.634]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:39.654 --> 00:59:40.794]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:40.814 --> 00:59:42.675]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:08.315]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:08.976 --> 01:00:09.777]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.558 --> 01:00:11.459]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:15.985]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.305 --> 01:00:20.351]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.693 --> 01:00:26.954]  Okay, I got a big news blitz coming up and more of your phone calls after Mike leaves us here in about five minutes.
[01:00:27.394 --> 01:00:46.739]  I got a bunch of other news I want to hit on, not just the convoy situation, but look, I wouldn't be reporting on it that much if, you know, ships are getting boarded all the time, going into countries' waters, this was international waters, I wouldn't even be covering it that much if you just had 20 people killed, which is a bad thing, but it's...
[01:00:48.379 --> 01:00:50.520]  It's not as big as some of the things happening in the world.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.421]  But this has the potential to lead to a full-bore war.
[01:00:55.341 --> 01:01:00.943]  And so you can really see world events are accelerating into a quickening right now.
[01:01:01.823 --> 01:01:04.424]  Let's go ahead and talk to Josh in California.
[01:01:04.444 --> 01:01:06.645]  You're on the air with our guest, Mike Rivera.
[01:01:06.685 --> 01:01:07.065]  Go ahead.
[01:01:08.101 --> 01:01:08.842]  Hey Alex, hey Mike.
[01:01:08.882 --> 01:01:10.504]  So listen, I want to actually ask you guys something.
[01:01:10.524 --> 01:01:19.633]  I received an email from a pastor of mine that actually does missionary work in Jerusalem and Gaza, and he sent this out last night.
[01:01:19.653 --> 01:01:22.115]  He was saying, do you mind if I read a couple points real quickly from it?
[01:01:22.335 --> 01:01:22.756]  Go ahead.
[01:01:23.517 --> 01:01:24.638]  I'd like both your takes on it.
[01:01:24.658 --> 01:01:31.685]  He was saying that even after blockade has begun, ships have routinely followed protocol and docked in Israel, ports such as Ashdod,
[01:01:32.365 --> 01:01:34.709]  And their cargo had been carried to land into Gaza without a problem.
[01:01:34.729 --> 01:01:39.095]  He said that, uh, the captain of all six ships were notified that they would not be allowed to break the barcade.
[01:01:39.907 --> 01:01:44.688]  I mean, instead of the six ships that were boarded, only one chose to ambush the boarding IDF personnel.
[01:01:45.228 --> 01:01:51.669]  And then he says the ship which the conflict took place had 600 passengers on it, and eight ships usually loaded to the brim with supplies.
[01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:52.189]  This one didn't.
[01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:53.190]  So I don't know.
[01:01:53.210 --> 01:02:02.392]  He's also saying that the attempt to break the blockade was timed perfectly for the Netanyahu and the Abbas to meet with President Obama to discuss direct talks regarding the state solution.
[01:02:02.532 --> 01:02:04.912]  So I wanted to find out what your take is on it.
[01:02:05.072 --> 01:02:09.273]  I know this is him coming from Jerusalem, but I'd like to find out what you guys
[01:02:09.833 --> 01:02:10.354]  Think about that.
[01:02:12.335 --> 01:02:13.716]  Mike Rivero, comments.
[01:02:14.617 --> 01:02:28.647]  Well, first of all, Israel's claims that the aid would have been offloaded and taken into Gaza is a little bit weak because the particular supplies, construction supplies and so forth, have been blocked from Gaza by Israel for the last four years.
[01:02:29.067 --> 01:02:36.313]  If you remember, not too long ago, Israel made a big publicity thing about they were going to allow some aid into Gaza from Egypt.
[01:02:36.593 --> 01:02:47.316]  But the reality was that Israel kept the food supplies on pallets in the sun for so long that by the time they were allowed through the checkpoints, they had basically rotted and were no longer usable.
[01:02:47.676 --> 01:02:50.797]  So Israel wants to try and look good to the rest of the world.
[01:02:51.137 --> 01:03:03.201]  I mean, part of their propaganda is they're going around saying there are no shortages in Gaza, and yet we've had Senator John Kerry over there saying, yes, these people... You know, Israel's treating Gaza worse than the Nazis treated the Warsaw Ghetto.
[01:03:03.661 --> 01:03:12.665]  So Israel's claims that they would gladly ferry aid into Gaza, they haven't done it yet in any other than token situations and token volumes.
[01:03:13.046 --> 01:03:21.870]  And so the reason the Free Gaza Organization continues to send these ships, and by the way, a year ago, Israel grabbed the Spirit and threw Cynthia McKinney in prison for a while.
[01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:23.831]  So this has been their behavior all along.
[01:03:24.172 --> 01:03:30.757]  Any claims that Israel was willing to take the donated aid and get it to the people of Gaza, it generally doesn't work.
[01:03:30.977 --> 01:03:39.383]  What Israel will do is give it to the Palestinian Authority, who will then go out and basically do whatever they want with it, but it never reaches the people of Gaza.
[01:03:39.403 --> 01:03:46.189]  Well, you notice Gaza is run by Hamas, and Israel admits they set up Hamas as a counterbalance to Hezbollah.
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.923]  Just as they set up the Palestinian Authority to be a counterbalance to Hamas.
[01:03:50.984 --> 01:03:53.406]  It's the same game over and over and over again.
[01:03:53.866 --> 01:03:59.030]  Israel will put somebody into power in Gaza, and if they get too powerful, then Israel funds the opposition.
[01:03:59.251 --> 01:04:01.833]  When they rise to power, Israel creates a new opposition.
[01:04:03.194 --> 01:04:07.198]  And so, whoever they set up, one day, is later a terrorist.
[01:04:08.379 --> 01:04:08.959]  Exactly.
[01:04:09.259 --> 01:04:09.740]  Exactly.
[01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:12.831]  Well, it's the great game.
[01:04:12.911 --> 01:04:17.114]  It's very similar to the system the British used to maintain control of their sprawling empire.
[01:04:18.235 --> 01:04:23.239]  It's just that I just hope this can be diffused.
[01:04:23.279 --> 01:04:29.944]  But it's clear that Israel doesn't want it diffused because they believe they're going to win wars if they can precipitate a wider war.
[01:04:30.404 --> 01:04:34.367]  But I know the Lebanon experience of three years ago did not show that.
[01:04:36.752 --> 01:04:42.214]  Well, Israel thinks it's important to get the American people... Mike, I tell you what, stay there.
[01:04:43.234 --> 01:04:44.495]  Your mic was cutting out again.
[01:04:44.515 --> 01:04:50.457]  I think with your Skype, whenever we're sending you audio of music, it cuts you out.
[01:04:50.477 --> 01:04:52.718]  So let me have you finish on the other side.
[01:04:52.738 --> 01:04:54.239]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[01:04:54.259 --> 01:04:54.679]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.175 --> 01:05:00.437]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:00.477 --> 01:05:05.823]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:05:06.063 --> 01:05:10.689]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:05:11.069 --> 01:05:11.470]  It's true.
[01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:14.133]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:05:14.373 --> 01:05:16.116]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:05:16.636 --> 01:05:21.339]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:28.785]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:05:28.985 --> 01:05:29.885]  And here's the best part.
[01:05:30.105 --> 01:05:36.470]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:39.631]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:39.972 --> 01:05:41.852]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:05:43.133 --> 01:05:43.513]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:05:43.533 --> 01:05:46.274]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:05:46.775 --> 01:05:48.495]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:58.902 --> 01:06:00.443]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:00.563 --> 01:06:03.365]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[01:06:52.249 --> 01:06:52.709]  Thank you!
[01:06:58.604 --> 01:07:00.905]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:07:00.925 --> 01:07:03.226]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:07:03.306 --> 01:07:06.047]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:07:06.528 --> 01:07:11.290]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:15.832]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:07:16.152 --> 01:07:18.476]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:07:18.596 --> 01:07:21.019]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.944]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:07:24.284 --> 01:07:31.896]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:07:32.222 --> 01:07:37.527]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:07:37.607 --> 01:07:39.889]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:07:39.929 --> 01:07:43.892]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:07:44.152 --> 01:07:45.073]  And I've got news for you.
[01:07:45.233 --> 01:07:46.534]  You're everyone else.
[01:07:46.554 --> 01:07:47.615]  Invisible Empire.

[01:08:20.903 --> 01:08:24.404]  All right, we're now eight minutes into the third hour.
[01:08:24.504 --> 01:08:32.105]  Got Webster Tarbley coming up in the last hour, talking about the economy, the North Korea situation, the Mediterranean flotilla.
[01:08:33.302 --> 01:08:34.983]  With Israel boarding these craft.
[01:08:38.646 --> 01:08:43.650]  We're going to talk to Keith, Frank, Ted, Jimmy, Matt and others here in just a moment.
[01:08:44.331 --> 01:08:47.554]  But Mike, joining us from Hawaii via video Skype.
[01:08:48.134 --> 01:08:52.538]  For folks that are watching us on PrisonPlanet.tv, finish up the point you were trying to make.
[01:08:53.971 --> 01:09:06.623]  Well, before I finish up that point about the game playing where Israel will set up the opposition parties in Palestine to keep the Palestinians divided and under control, we just had this story come in.
[01:09:06.763 --> 01:09:13.630]  CNN is now reporting that a member of the Israeli parliament who was on board that Turkish ship
[01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:14.691]  I don't know.
[01:09:29.087 --> 01:09:35.355]  And that when they started boarding the ship, the people on the ship fought back because they felt they were underneath attack.
[01:09:35.516 --> 01:09:38.239]  This is coming from a member of the Israeli Parliament saying this.
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.564]  And we just put this up at whatreallyhappened.com.
[01:09:41.904 --> 01:09:44.928]  Now again, getting back to the situation in Palestine.
[01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:50.294]  Obviously, Israel covets the Palestinian land, and it always has.
[01:09:50.655 --> 01:09:59.985]  If you look at the maps of Israel ever since David Ben-Gurion declared it to be in existence, you see this constant pattern of increasing encroachment on the Palestinian lands.
[01:10:01.026 --> 01:10:18.540]  And every time the Palestinians try and form a government to basically establish their state, which the UN promised them, Israel will covertly fund an opposition group in order to be able to go around and say, we can't talk peace with the Palestinians, we don't know who we're supposed to talk to.
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.720]  No, wait, it's worse than that.
[01:10:19.761 --> 01:10:21.482]  The Jerusalem Post and Haaretz.
[01:10:21.502 --> 01:10:22.382]  I mean, this is in Israel.
[01:10:23.419 --> 01:10:24.440]  And that's the funny thing.
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:30.467]  They admit the Israeli military can nix anything they don't want in the news, like the denotices they have in England.
[01:10:31.028 --> 01:10:41.440]  So, even in their own media, they admit that Israel, since the 60s, has created and funded radical Muslim groups to destabilize a peace process.
[01:10:43.399 --> 01:10:55.069]  And it's even worse than that because we know that Israel has set up fake Al-Qaeda terrorist cells in Palestine in order to try and tarnish the image of the Palestinians and the rest of the world.
[01:10:55.089 --> 01:10:56.950]  No, that was the Jerusalem Post headline.
[01:10:57.010 --> 01:10:58.652]  Israel creates fake Al-Qaeda, yeah.
[01:10:59.272 --> 01:11:00.012]  Yeah, that was it.
[01:11:00.573 --> 01:11:09.977]  And so it's all deception, and it's all pretend, and it's all make-believe, and the good news is more and more people around the world are beginning to understand this is how these things are being done.
[01:11:09.997 --> 01:11:26.785]  You know, we cannot expect, you know, truth and accuracy coming from government statements, or for that matter, most of the corporate media, which is why less than 10% of Americans are now getting their political news from the TV network news, and your and my readership and viewership and listenership are continuing to skyrocket.
[01:11:27.165 --> 01:11:29.688]  People want the truth, and they're going to go where they can get it.
[01:11:30.508 --> 01:11:49.647]  And the ability of the corporate media and these government propagandists to manipulate and control public opinion is very much starting to crumble before their eyes, which is, as you pointed out earlier, they're passing laws, you've got to be licensed to be a journalist, the government is going to come in and post their messages on everybody's website to make sure their message gets out.
[01:11:53.044 --> 01:11:58.788]  In fact, I've got that Fox News article here in my stack, and I'm going to cover it later after you leave us.
[01:11:58.868 --> 01:12:03.251]  But that's what's so amazing, is the media now reports this like it's normal.
[01:12:03.291 --> 01:12:08.715]  Like, yeah, you're not going to be able to have a blog or a website now, unless the government first approves it.
[01:12:08.815 --> 01:12:15.399]  And even after that happens, you'll have to have government messages up on your website to counterbalance anything you say.
[01:12:15.419 --> 01:12:17.401]  I mean, this is not freedom, Mike.
[01:12:18.328 --> 01:12:20.789]  No, it isn't, but it is in the interest of the corporate media.
[01:12:20.829 --> 01:12:43.101]  They want their audience back, and if they can level the playing field where the blogs and alternative media are forced to parrot the same propaganda that the corporate media does, then the corporate media will lure their audience back because they've got the money for fancy sets and cute little girls in tight clothing and all the rest of those so-called production values that they like to rely on to trick the audience into coming and looking at their content.
[01:12:43.121 --> 01:12:43.701]  Well, that's right.
[01:12:43.761 --> 01:12:47.543]  The mainstream media is almost unanimously, from the Times,
[01:12:50.316 --> 01:12:56.079]  You know, Time Magazine to the New York Times, they're all promoting shutting down our free speech.
[01:12:56.379 --> 01:13:01.942]  Because, of course, they were these arrogant mainstream media people that love the fact that Americans didn't have a voice.
[01:13:03.103 --> 01:13:07.225]  They were still arrogant and thought, oh, little websites will never rival us.
[01:13:07.666 --> 01:13:09.547]  Now, we're trouncing them.
[01:13:10.067 --> 01:13:11.988]  In every poll, they have no credibility.
[01:13:12.028 --> 01:13:13.129]  We have high credibility.
[01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.750]  They're losing more of their market share every day.
[01:13:16.190 --> 01:13:17.131]  They're bleeding out.
[01:13:17.491 --> 01:13:18.552]  But I want to let them know
[01:13:19.798 --> 01:13:20.518]  It's too late.
[01:13:20.978 --> 01:13:22.599]  You can't put the genie back in the bottle.
[01:13:22.699 --> 01:13:24.600]  You're discredited whores.
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:25.420]  It's over.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.741]  So go ahead and try to shut the web down.
[01:13:28.101 --> 01:13:29.922]  Show everybody who you really are.
[01:13:31.302 --> 01:13:34.544]  Yeah, the war with the blogs isn't just starting.
[01:13:34.644 --> 01:13:35.504]  It's already over.
[01:13:35.584 --> 01:13:36.844]  And the blogs won.
[01:13:37.065 --> 01:13:38.585]  The damage is already done.
[01:13:38.625 --> 01:13:39.025]  The U.S.
[01:13:39.045 --> 01:13:43.447]  government is dealing with a credibility crisis of mammoth proportions of its own making.
[01:13:43.907 --> 01:13:48.229]  And right now, this moment, as we watch President Barack Obama
[01:13:49.284 --> 01:13:55.926]  Basically, just stand there impotent and mute before Israel's kidnapping of American citizens from international waters.
[01:13:56.266 --> 01:13:58.306]  The American people are getting very, very angry.
[01:13:58.607 --> 01:14:02.748]  And they're not all that angry with Israel, because Israel is basically acting true to type.
[01:14:03.188 --> 01:14:04.488]  They're angry with the U.S.
[01:14:04.588 --> 01:14:07.949]  government for very obviously selling out.
[01:14:08.009 --> 01:14:11.770]  The European press is saying Obama knew ahead of time that this was going to happen.
[01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:13.991]  So we have this situation of the U.S.
[01:14:14.071 --> 01:14:18.572]  government basically going along with a foreign government's attack on our own people.
[01:14:19.332 --> 01:14:20.994]  And most Americans see this as treason.
[01:14:21.254 --> 01:14:23.557]  All right, Mike, I really appreciate you joining us.
[01:14:23.577 --> 01:14:33.649]  We'll see you again next month, unless the economy continues to implode and they stage a new war and shut the web down, which is something under the Cybersecurity Act they're openly talking about.
[01:14:33.689 --> 01:14:36.152]  But hopefully we'll be here again next month.
[01:14:36.452 --> 01:14:37.293]  Mike, good having you on.
[01:14:37.313 --> 01:14:38.134]  We appreciate the time.
[01:14:38.775 --> 01:14:39.495]  Thank you very much.
[01:14:39.555 --> 01:14:40.816]  I look forward to seeing you next month.
[01:14:40.956 --> 01:14:41.736]  All right, take care.
[01:14:42.196 --> 01:14:46.878]  Well, he made a lot of really good points and made some very convincing arguments there.
[01:14:48.198 --> 01:14:51.999]  I just want to add, in the larger whole, Israel is also being played in this.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:15:00.122]  All the nations of the earth are being manipulated by this military-industrial complex.
[01:15:00.902 --> 01:15:03.003]  And we do have the counterpunch article.
[01:15:03.023 --> 01:15:06.466]  We're going to get it up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:15:07.046 --> 01:15:16.352]  A member of Israeli Knesset says that Israeli military did begin firing on the ships five minutes before they even boarded.
[01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:27.776]  And so if that is confirmed, that is just amazing to have something like that going on.
[01:15:28.736 --> 01:15:31.458]  But right now, let's go back through these calls.
[01:15:31.918 --> 01:15:35.720]  Ted called in earlier, and I put him on hold, because he wanted to talk about a local issue.
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.421]  Yeah, they're bringing a $25 million a year Formula One track.
[01:15:41.863 --> 01:15:43.004]  To Austin, Texas.
[01:15:43.064 --> 01:15:46.528]  And Austin can't support a football team, a baseball team, a basketball team.
[01:15:47.289 --> 01:15:50.253]  It can barely support, you know, a minor league baseball team.
[01:15:51.574 --> 01:15:54.177]  And that's the city council.
[01:15:54.337 --> 01:15:55.158]  It's a rich city.
[01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:57.781]  A lot of smart people here, so they're stealing.
[01:15:58.782 --> 01:16:03.446]  2.6 billion in new energy taxes over three years, carbon taxes, new regulations.
[01:16:05.108 --> 01:16:11.193]  They spend 76 million on all the roads and 100 plus million on the buses that less than 1% ride.
[01:16:11.773 --> 01:16:12.974]  We have a criminal city.
[01:16:13.034 --> 01:16:14.716]  But look, you deserve it, Austin.
[01:16:15.416 --> 01:16:17.778]  And this is happening in other cities around the country.
[01:16:18.158 --> 01:16:24.884]  Because you're mad, but you won't go to city council, you won't go to county commissioner, you won't speak up because your name might show up on Google.
[01:16:25.725 --> 01:16:26.946]  So you're going to get gang raped.
[01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:31.209]  But yeah, the evil carbon footprint of the Formula One racing.
[01:16:31.789 --> 01:16:36.813]  I mean, if you want to build a chicken coop in the county outside Austin, you better bow down and worship the government.
[01:16:37.534 --> 01:16:42.718]  If you want to basically, you know, throw a stick in the air, you better get a license for it.
[01:16:43.719 --> 01:16:46.141]  But if you want to steal a farmer's ranch,
[01:16:46.781 --> 01:16:49.804]  And then build high-rises on it, and you're the former mayor?
[01:16:50.244 --> 01:16:51.365]  I mean, literal mobster?
[01:16:51.745 --> 01:16:56.209]  You could pour cyanide in the creek, and there'll be cops there bowing down and worshipping it.
[01:16:56.730 --> 01:16:59.612]  I mean, it is just a criminal group of lawless scum.
[01:17:00.153 --> 01:17:04.617]  But you want to do a comment on that, Ted, so go ahead and make your point.
[01:17:04.677 --> 01:17:10.041]  I'm going to go to Keith, Fred, Jimmy, Matt, and others, and I do have a news blitz coming up at the bottom of the hour, so I've got to hurry here.
[01:17:10.101 --> 01:17:10.402]  Go ahead.
[01:17:11.035 --> 01:17:12.496]  Well, what a beautiful introduction.
[01:17:12.876 --> 01:17:15.277]  And it does go past the city level.
[01:17:15.317 --> 01:17:26.523]  It's all the way up to the state, because what happened is Kirk Watson, in the same session of 2009, he wrote Senate Bill 184, Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Strategy.
[01:17:27.123 --> 01:17:30.024]  And in the same session, he wrote Senate Bill 1515,
[01:17:32.045 --> 01:17:34.186]  Which gave the funding to the racetrack.
[01:17:34.247 --> 01:17:53.960]  So I think... And he's the one that owns the bank, and he controls through SOS the tens of thousands of acres taken, and he literally is the Don Carleone in three-piece suits, and he's gotten, you know, like fat like the penguin now, and he just struts around as if he is God, and just owns everything.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.402]  And literally, if you don't like it, paramilitary forces are on their way.
[01:17:57.422 --> 01:17:57.823]  Go ahead.
[01:17:58.747 --> 01:17:59.387]  You're right.
[01:17:59.587 --> 01:18:00.368]  I'm worried, Alex.
[01:18:00.488 --> 01:18:01.948]  I'm, you know, checking my front door.
[01:18:02.429 --> 01:18:04.009]  But I've posted a little article.
[01:18:04.069 --> 01:18:08.631]  It's called, City of Austin Welcomes F1 Racing, Ignores Climate Protection Plan.
[01:18:09.071 --> 01:18:10.272]  It's on the Prison Planet Forum.
[01:18:11.036 --> 01:18:19.964]  All right, in fact, let's have Curt Nemo or somebody send that to Showtips or Reuters and he'll read over it because I am aware of everything you just talked about.
[01:18:21.325 --> 01:18:23.667]  But that's what the climate bills are made for.
[01:18:24.088 --> 01:18:28.552]  If you're part of the inside mafia, you don't have to have any environmental standards.
[01:18:28.972 --> 01:18:31.975]  But if you're not part of their mafia, you could have
[01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:36.378]  Something as clean as Baby Jesus' diapers.
[01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:39.062]  And you are not going to build it.
[01:18:39.422 --> 01:18:40.103]  You understand?
[01:18:40.223 --> 01:18:42.066]  You come to them for a job.
[01:18:42.366 --> 01:18:43.608]  They run your life.
[01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:44.910]  And I've been there.
[01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:50.637]  I remember 10, 12, 13, 14 years ago going back, going to farmers' and ranchers' houses outside Austin.
[01:18:51.198 --> 01:18:57.103]  And they'd come in and they'd say, we're not paying you but three cents on the dollar for this ranch, and we're taking it with a bond proposal.
[01:18:57.403 --> 01:19:11.454]  And the city of Austin, the communists would line up, and you know, the dirty leg hippies, and they would take every inch of that property, and then as soon as they had all the land, no longer do they trot up all the hippies at city council to be the babies.
[01:19:12.054 --> 01:19:15.536]  No, they banned them individually from speaking selectively.
[01:19:15.576 --> 01:19:18.558]  They said, you're a trouble speaker and now it's nothing about that.
[01:19:18.918 --> 01:19:20.859]  And now they've moved on to their carbon taxes.
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:27.844]  And let me tell you, you drive out there in southwest Travis County, the tens of thousands of acres, it's...
[01:19:28.624 --> 01:19:34.968]  Big ol' five million dollar homes, luxury spas, just malls.
[01:19:35.689 --> 01:19:38.411]  And if you want it, you go to that former city council.
[01:19:38.511 --> 01:19:43.014]  Every one of them is just a Royal Richie now, who just owns everything.
[01:19:43.074 --> 01:19:45.295]  I mean, it's just total lawlessness.
[01:19:47.136 --> 01:19:49.138]  It feels good.
[01:19:49.798 --> 01:19:51.840]  And now they're going to do it on a mass scale.
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:54.461]  You cannot describe the evil.
[01:19:54.802 --> 01:19:56.623]  But hey, you people lay there and take it?
[01:19:56.863 --> 01:19:58.344]  Well, they're going to give it out to you.
[01:19:58.664 --> 01:19:59.104]  Don't worry!
[01:19:59.725 --> 01:20:00.985]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:20:01.025 --> 01:20:06.387]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:20:06.608 --> 01:20:11.250]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:12.030]  It's true.
[01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:14.691]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:20:14.931 --> 01:20:16.652]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:20:17.208 --> 01:20:21.912]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:20:22.432 --> 01:20:24.354]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:20:24.734 --> 01:20:29.358]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:30.439]  And here's the best part.
[01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:33.441]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:20:33.741 --> 01:20:37.044]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:20:37.364 --> 01:20:40.207]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:20:40.547 --> 01:20:42.448]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:20:42.769 --> 01:20:43.689]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:20:47.335 --> 01:20:48.355]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:20:48.775 --> 01:20:56.078]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:20:56.378 --> 01:20:58.839]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:20:59.779 --> 01:21:02.100]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:04.381]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:04.481 --> 01:21:07.242]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:07.682 --> 01:21:12.443]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:12.784 --> 01:21:16.965]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:19.646]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:21:19.746 --> 01:21:22.167]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:21:22.187 --> 01:21:25.088]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:21:25.428 --> 01:21:33.031]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:21:33.371 --> 01:21:38.636]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:21:38.776 --> 01:21:41.059]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:21:41.619 --> 01:21:45.063]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:21:45.303 --> 01:21:46.224]  And I got news for you.
[01:21:46.384 --> 01:21:47.685]  You're everyone else.
[01:21:47.725 --> 01:21:48.766]  Invisible Empire.

[01:21:58.965 --> 01:21:59.345]  Good day.
[01:21:59.585 --> 01:22:01.106]  Jim Newcomer from IDIS Resources.
[01:22:01.366 --> 01:22:01.746]  June 1st, 2010.
[01:22:01.846 --> 01:22:02.627]  Gold opened this morning at $1225.40.
[01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:05.988]  One ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1258.07, $629.03 for a half ounce, or $314.52 for the quarter ounce.
[01:22:06.028 --> 01:22:06.509]  That's $1258.07, $629.03, or $314.52.
[01:22:18.374 --> 01:22:21.015]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[01:22:21.456 --> 01:22:25.377]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[01:22:25.758 --> 01:22:30.360]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:34.121]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold.
[01:22:34.401 --> 01:22:39.144]  Discussing costs, benefits, risks, the book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:22:42.165 --> 01:22:45.368]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[01:22:45.608 --> 01:22:49.472]  Discover how gold can be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:22:49.492 --> 01:22:51.514]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, this book is free.
[01:22:51.574 --> 01:22:51.754]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.106 --> 01:23:00.766]  The problem.
[01:23:00.846 --> 01:23:02.927]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:23:03.427 --> 01:23:05.607]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:08.328]  How do I get emergency radio broadcast?
[01:23:08.808 --> 01:23:10.468]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:23:11.308 --> 01:23:20.110]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KaroStove.
[01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:23.951]  KaroStove has been in business for over 12 years with the largest selection of
[01:23:24.051 --> 01:23:27.333]  Kerosene stoves and family preparedness supplies in the U.S.
[01:23:54.071 --> 01:24:08.763]  Okay, it turns out what Mike Ribeiro was talking about is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:08.803 --> 01:24:10.044]  It's been there all morning.
[01:24:10.124 --> 01:24:10.544]  I missed it.
[01:24:11.025 --> 01:24:21.413]  Israeli Knesset member Israel wanted a high number of fatalities and then it's got the quotes from him here about them firing on the ship before they even boarded it.
[01:24:21.533 --> 01:24:23.155]  Man, that is just wrong!
[01:24:24.468 --> 01:24:26.269]  I mean, why is Israel doing this?
[01:24:27.210 --> 01:24:28.771]  Why is Israel doing this?
[01:24:28.851 --> 01:24:29.991]  I mean, I don't hate Israel.
[01:24:30.652 --> 01:24:34.474]  I'm not one of these people that, it's like a religion of disliking Israel.
[01:24:34.494 --> 01:24:40.418]  I mean, I found a lot of the people that hate Israel themselves are a bunch of nuts and make stuff up about people.
[01:24:40.538 --> 01:24:41.458]  I've experienced it.
[01:24:41.999 --> 01:24:46.761]  Just because I'm not a frothing anti-Israel person, I criticize Israel all the time.
[01:24:48.343 --> 01:24:54.068]  You know, these people will get really mad at me and like make up lies about me and say things that aren't true.
[01:24:54.468 --> 01:24:57.931]  So that makes the anti-Israel crew, you know, lose credibility in my mind.
[01:24:58.312 --> 01:25:01.735]  But still, I mean, it's just Israel continues to do all these bad things.
[01:25:02.275 --> 01:25:03.777]  And we're going to report on it here.
[01:25:05.478 --> 01:25:09.782]  You know, I understand they feel like they're surrounded and they hate their neighbors and everything and their neighbors hate them.
[01:25:11.529 --> 01:25:12.949]  This is not going to go over well.
[01:25:13.889 --> 01:25:17.990]  Look, I want to continue with Keith, Frank, Jimmy, Matt, Ken, and others.
[01:25:18.690 --> 01:25:23.371]  And then I do have four giant stacks of incredibly important news we're going to go over.
[01:25:24.471 --> 01:25:26.232]  Let's go to Keith in Texas.
[01:25:26.272 --> 01:25:27.112]  Keith, you're on the air.
[01:25:28.232 --> 01:25:29.212]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:25:29.672 --> 01:25:36.453]  I was able to get on the Sean Hannity Show and plug Invisible Empire successfully and get him to talk about it a little bit.
[01:25:36.793 --> 01:25:37.274]  Good job.
[01:25:37.334 --> 01:25:38.354]  Master 5 channel.
[01:25:39.514 --> 01:25:39.794]  Thank you.
[01:25:40.413 --> 01:25:42.133]  It's up there ready for people to see it.
[01:25:42.273 --> 01:25:48.814]  If they check out Funkmaster5, all spelled out, press that yellow subscribe button, and it's there.
[01:25:49.235 --> 01:25:51.595]  What did Hannity say?
[01:25:52.675 --> 01:26:00.096]  Well, he let me talk about it a little bit, which surprised me, because the last time I called him, he just hung up on me as quick as he could.
[01:26:01.717 --> 01:26:07.058]  And he ended up saying that he doesn't believe the bankers are in control.
[01:26:07.538 --> 01:26:08.938]  Oh yeah, they're good.
[01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:11.232]  Yeah, of course.
[01:26:11.352 --> 01:26:13.533]  Did he deny that there's a world government?
[01:26:13.553 --> 01:26:19.316]  Because he's done his job good the last decade telling conservatives there's no such thing as a New World Order.
[01:26:20.556 --> 01:26:28.380]  Well, you know, the last time I talked to him about Bilderberg Group, he equated it to a mother spaceship flying around the Earth.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.801]  You know, but he's going to have a problem.
[01:26:30.841 --> 01:26:34.282]  His little commander, Glenn Beck, does talk about it.
[01:26:34.302 --> 01:26:38.144]  I mean, Bilderberg's admitted now, so they've got some eggy on their faces.
[01:26:40.049 --> 01:26:45.253]  Well, yeah, you know, and they're both losing ratings and losing listeners.
[01:26:46.838 --> 01:26:49.959]  I've seen the statistics.
[01:26:50.339 --> 01:26:53.240]  Hannity and Beck are in free fall.
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:56.861]  And of course we're exploding and everybody else who tells the truth is exploding.
[01:26:57.461 --> 01:27:05.903]  And that's because people aren't just mad at incumbent Democrats or incumbent Republicans as every election the last year has shown.
[01:27:06.304 --> 01:27:12.945]  They're mad at establishment media and people now know that Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity are establishment.
[01:27:13.005 --> 01:27:14.426]  But I'm going to be honest.
[01:27:15.186 --> 01:27:19.047]  At least Glenn Beck isn't openly anti-Second Amendment.
[01:27:19.608 --> 01:27:22.048]  He doesn't do much to really defend it, but at least he isn't against it.
[01:27:22.488 --> 01:27:25.449]  At least Sean Hannity isn't openly against the Second Amendment.
[01:27:26.010 --> 01:27:28.130]  At least Sean Hannity wants to control our borders.
[01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:36.413]  So I will say, you know, if I had to choose the poison I was going to drink, arsenic isn't good, but it takes a lot to kill you.
[01:27:36.873 --> 01:27:38.754]  Cyanide will kill you immediately.
[01:27:39.795 --> 01:27:45.944]  And the stuff coming out of Chris Matthews' mouth is cyanide, whereas Glenn Beck is only,
[01:27:48.427 --> 01:27:49.708]  You know, a lesser poison.
[01:27:50.068 --> 01:27:53.251]  And I don't really believe in lesser of two evils for a politician.
[01:27:53.932 --> 01:27:56.314]  It's just that they do do some good.
[01:27:57.135 --> 01:27:58.536]  And so I want to give them credit for that.
[01:27:58.576 --> 01:28:05.202]  I mean, Glenn Beck is going the furthest of anybody, admitting world government, admitting global governance, admitting all this.
[01:28:06.082 --> 01:28:09.946]  And they're going to be forced to go all the way, or they're not going to have any viewers.
[01:28:10.006 --> 01:28:10.987]  I appreciate your call, Keith.
[01:28:11.007 --> 01:28:11.427]  Good job.
[01:28:12.268 --> 01:28:13.869]  Frank in New York, you're on the air.
[01:28:13.909 --> 01:28:14.250]  Go ahead.
[01:28:15.226 --> 01:28:16.267]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:28:16.427 --> 01:28:34.956]  Yeah, I wanted to say this, that this really is incredibly stupid of Israel to attack the Turkish vessel 90 miles in the Mediterranean off the coast of Israel in international waters.
[01:28:35.476 --> 01:28:37.657]  It's an act of war under international law.
[01:28:37.797 --> 01:28:38.477]  It's aggression.
[01:28:38.537 --> 01:28:39.718]  It's also piracy.
[01:28:40.598 --> 01:28:41.979]  And what's interesting about it is
[01:28:42.406 --> 01:29:02.576]  That the history of Israel, the Jewish refugees escaping from Europe on the Exodus and other ships that ran the British blockade, ultimately, through the press and media, gave tacit support to the Zionists, setting up the State of Israel.
[01:29:02.636 --> 01:29:08.759]  So for Israel to attack the Turkish flotilla, providing relief, humanitarian relief,
[01:29:09.557 --> 01:29:09.857]  I think?
[01:29:28.838 --> 01:29:31.519]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:31.619 --> 01:29:33.980]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.773 --> 01:30:02.374]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:02.794 --> 01:30:07.755]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:08.115 --> 01:30:09.836]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:10.156 --> 01:30:14.977]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:15.157 --> 01:30:16.117]  How much do you want?
[01:30:16.337 --> 01:30:17.097]  When do you want it?
[01:30:17.457 --> 01:30:19.058]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:19.358 --> 01:30:20.178]  When will you need it?
[01:30:20.418 --> 01:30:22.479]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:22.619 --> 01:30:23.679]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:23.959 --> 01:30:25.299]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:25.479 --> 01:30:30.561]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:30.741 --> 01:30:33.942]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:34.342 --> 01:30:37.843]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:38.163 --> 01:30:39.143]  How much will you need?
[01:30:39.383 --> 01:30:39.983]  We don't know.
[01:30:40.283 --> 01:30:41.204]  How much do you want?
[01:30:41.384 --> 01:30:42.084]  All you can get.
[01:30:42.304 --> 01:30:43.165]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:43.405 --> 01:30:46.166]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:46.466 --> 01:30:49.568]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.588 --> 01:30:50.349]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:30:58.857 --> 01:31:03.720]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:04.581]  What have we got?
[01:31:04.821 --> 01:31:06.962]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:31:07.262 --> 01:31:07.963]  A republic.
[01:31:08.263 --> 01:31:10.844]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:31:10.925 --> 01:31:12.826]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:31:13.186 --> 01:31:15.087]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:31:15.207 --> 01:31:16.468]  So they think they own our land?
[01:31:16.888 --> 01:31:18.009]  They think they own our water?
[01:31:18.209 --> 01:31:18.609]  Children?
[01:31:18.809 --> 01:31:19.590]  Our education?
[01:31:19.930 --> 01:31:20.550]  Our money?
[01:31:20.771 --> 01:31:24.413]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:31:24.773 --> 01:31:28.417]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:31:29.759 --> 01:31:30.580]  We have the facts.
[01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:31.881]  We have the Constitution.
[01:31:31.941 --> 01:31:32.823]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:31:32.843 --> 01:31:33.684]  We have common law.
[01:31:33.724 --> 01:31:35.986]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:36.247 --> 01:31:40.031]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:31:40.131 --> 01:31:44.914]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:31:45.095 --> 01:31:46.455]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:31:46.576 --> 01:31:47.436]  Don't tread on me.
[01:31:47.676 --> 01:31:54.541]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:31:58.757 --> 01:32:02.700]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:08.964]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:32:09.344 --> 01:32:16.429]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:32:16.729 --> 01:32:21.312]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:32:21.593 --> 01:32:23.734]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:32:26.536 --> 01:32:30.058]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:32:30.298 --> 01:32:32.560]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:32.900]  Call us!
[01:32:46.048 --> 01:32:55.913]  Okay, I want to hurry through your calls because there's a bunch of news I want to get to before Webster Tarpley joins us to break down the big developments in the economy.
[01:33:11.718 --> 01:33:15.722]  What's happening on the Korean Peninsula and of course with Israel and the flotilla.
[01:33:16.262 --> 01:33:18.905]  Get his perspective, always informative, coming up.
[01:33:19.666 --> 01:33:21.327]  Going back to Frank in New York.
[01:33:22.829 --> 01:33:28.534]  Frank, normally when a nation announces it's going to start stopping shipping, that's a big issue.
[01:33:29.135 --> 01:33:32.558]  But you've got a multi-nation flotilla, the main ship out of Turkey.
[01:33:33.039 --> 01:33:35.921]  Turkey inspected the vessels, said no weapons were on board.
[01:33:37.290 --> 01:33:54.012]  And now, for those that just joined us, Turkey is all over the news saying they are already dispatching four frigates and support ships to that area of the Mediterranean off the coast of Israel to aid future convoys.
[01:33:55.683 --> 01:34:00.609]  Turkey, it appears, is now looking for a confrontation with Israel.
[01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:04.973]  They have a word for it, but we have children listening, a you-know-what match.
[01:34:06.275 --> 01:34:16.827]  And so, and I go back to the last few months as I kept saying, the globalists want to start wars, and look what's happening in North Korea, look what's happening in Israel, look what's happening
[01:34:18.078 --> 01:34:22.700]  In Pakistan, look how Cheney tried to start a war with Russia two years ago.
[01:34:23.781 --> 01:34:27.862]  Clearly, they're not going to be able to continue this banking takeover.
[01:34:28.763 --> 01:34:38.227]  That's what they really care about, is looting the U.S., looting Europe, consolidating power, setting up the police state, without having wars to politically distract people.
[01:34:38.927 --> 01:34:40.508]  Finish up your point, Frank, in New York.
[01:34:41.084 --> 01:34:42.044]  What I wanted to say is this.
[01:34:42.784 --> 01:34:45.185]  Israel seized the Turkish vessels.
[01:34:45.845 --> 01:34:52.206]  So actually, under international law, Turkey has every right to go in to retrieve those vessels.
[01:34:52.606 --> 01:35:03.189]  Plus, normally, through diplomatic back channels, if you're going to seize ships on the high sea with governments or their problems, you actually inform the governments of this, of your intentions.
[01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:04.049]  You have to do that.
[01:35:04.309 --> 01:35:09.530]  If you think back to the Lusitania, you remember that the German government put ads two weeks in advance
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:10.480]  I don't
[01:35:26.741 --> 01:35:31.203]  of international law as well, you know, being a neutral nation at that time.
[01:35:31.624 --> 01:35:34.665]  So what you have to remember is that this actually is planned.
[01:35:34.685 --> 01:35:50.553]  What I wanted to also say that struck me on Friday was when the Wayne Madsen report reported that Barack Obama and Rob Emanuel are members of the gay bathhouse club in Chicago and that they have membership cards.
[01:35:50.613 --> 01:35:52.274]  And I was thinking, this is very strange.
[01:35:52.354 --> 01:35:53.335]  Why would this come out?
[01:35:54.415 --> 01:36:02.838]  It's very interesting that all of the world press is aware of this story, but none of it is coming out in the American major media.
[01:36:02.858 --> 01:36:06.559]  I found that to be very strange, because you wouldn't want to destroy the credibility of your number one source.
[01:36:18.722 --> 01:36:22.103]  Supporter, Rahm Emanuel, in the White House.
[01:36:22.283 --> 01:36:25.364]  And I thought that was one of the most bizarre things to have happened.
[01:36:25.624 --> 01:36:31.845]  But I never would have anticipated that Israel would have attacked, on Monday, the peace flotilla.
[01:36:32.526 --> 01:36:36.027]  And to me, it's just, it's meshugganah, it's craziness.
[01:36:36.647 --> 01:36:44.589]  And it's time to maybe enforce the Symington Amendment, because ultimately, the weapons used in this were financed by the United States, to aid the country.
[01:36:46.089 --> 01:36:55.491]  The Symington Amendment prohibits any use of American aid or assistance, you know, against civilians in a war situation.
[01:36:55.871 --> 01:37:07.393]  So by enforcing the Symington Amendment that should have been enforced back in Operation Cast Lead, December of 2008 and January of 2009, the aid to Israel would have been stopped.
[01:37:07.713 --> 01:37:13.034]  And I think that would waken up the members of the Knesset and the coalition parties
[01:37:13.573 --> 01:37:24.476]  Frank, I hear you and those are all great points and I'm glad you brought up the Lusitania.
[01:37:24.516 --> 01:37:27.557]  I appreciate your call because I meant to start the show with that.
[01:37:27.597 --> 01:37:29.037]  I was thinking about that driving in.
[01:37:30.478 --> 01:37:38.940]  Here you have the Germans for two weeks in New York and New Jersey and other papers running ads saying do not take passage to London
[01:37:40.939 --> 01:37:43.780]  Or to other cities on this list of ships.
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:51.203]  And chief among them was the Lusitania, which was carrying armaments and soldiers.
[01:37:53.004 --> 01:37:56.245]  And that is what got the United States into World War I.
[01:37:59.386 --> 01:38:13.028]  And absolutely, the Germans had been for years sinking British ships all over the Atlantic and the Mediterranean during World War I. Hard-fought war, a lot of it with U-boat wolf packs.
[01:38:14.372 --> 01:38:17.095]  And it was sunk, of course, off the Irish coast.
[01:38:17.775 --> 01:38:22.940]  And our media spun it and said, oh my gosh, the Germans did this on purpose.
[01:38:23.841 --> 01:38:29.066]  And wanted to kill Americans when the Germans said, don't sail on this ship.
[01:38:29.407 --> 01:38:31.809]  So a lot of wars have started over blockades.
[01:38:32.289 --> 01:38:36.193]  Let's go back to the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 60s.
[01:38:38.049 --> 01:38:41.650]  We went to the very highest DEFCON right before launching weapons.
[01:38:41.730 --> 01:38:43.851]  It was almost World War III.
[01:38:44.771 --> 01:38:55.654]  And then in back channels, Kennedy got on the phone with Nikita Khrushchev, and this has now been declassified, and said, look, the Pentagon wants to kill me.
[01:38:56.809 --> 01:39:00.573]  And they want to have nuclear war with you, and I'm in danger of a coup.
[01:39:01.314 --> 01:39:05.398]  Our military probably has close to double the high-tech weapons you have, nukes.
[01:39:06.259 --> 01:39:10.424]  This has even been a Frontline special, but I knew about it separately from Frontline.
[01:39:10.464 --> 01:39:12.086]  I don't just watch Frontline and believe it.
[01:39:12.126 --> 01:39:14.288]  I mean, this has been declassified in the last decade.
[01:39:15.191 --> 01:39:19.913]  And before they even declassified Northwoods, it was in the news that he said, look, L.L.
[01:39:19.973 --> 01:39:24.836]  Lehmann, sir, and others that are getting ready to fire, they could overthrow me.
[01:39:24.976 --> 01:39:26.497]  They want to have nuclear war with you.
[01:39:26.757 --> 01:39:31.399]  And at that time, Curtis LeMay was running around the head of the Air Force saying, nuke them, nuke them.
[01:39:31.479 --> 01:39:39.063]  That's why they made the movie Dr. Strangelove three years later about that, with General Jack T. Ripper, you know, playing the part of Curtis LeMay.
[01:39:40.283 --> 01:39:43.505]  And they really intended to have nuclear war.
[01:39:45.174 --> 01:39:48.035]  And Kennedy said no, another reason they killed him.
[01:39:48.335 --> 01:39:50.576]  I'm not saying Kennedy was an angel or Kennedy was perfect.
[01:39:51.357 --> 01:40:06.724]  His brother Bobby, it turned out in 1962, and this was declassified by the State Department two months ago, wanted to attack areas of Central and South America by blowing up, namely Honduras, by blowing up U.S.
[01:40:06.804 --> 01:40:11.286]  embassies and blaming it on their government.
[01:40:12.446 --> 01:40:15.509]  It was just when it came to killing Americans that Kennedy said no.
[01:40:15.949 --> 01:40:18.011]  This is such a part of governments.
[01:40:19.012 --> 01:40:26.720]  My only issue is I think it takes the political power away from this when you depoliticize it.
[01:40:29.201 --> 01:40:35.105]  Or de-radicalize it and just look at it objectively and coldly as a fact.
[01:40:35.825 --> 01:40:46.332]  I remember when I was on air in 1996, criticizing communist generals from China in the Commerce Department with their own faxes and phone lines and email, selling out U.S.
[01:40:46.372 --> 01:40:47.012]  sovereignty.
[01:40:48.113 --> 01:40:51.796]  And Treasury Secretary Ron Brown said, I'm not going to go to prison, I'll go public.
[01:40:52.176 --> 01:40:53.557]  And they killed him deader than a hammer.
[01:40:53.897 --> 01:40:58.320]  And even the Pentagon coroner, the colonel, said they'd all been shot in the head.
[01:40:59.622 --> 01:41:05.146]  Special forces on board the plane, posing as security, killed everybody, blew the door and high load or he lowed out of the aircraft.
[01:41:05.206 --> 01:41:13.412]  But CNN ran pieces saying, is it racist to criticize Chinese infiltration?
[01:41:14.793 --> 01:41:16.195]  Is it a hatred of Asians?
[01:41:19.337 --> 01:41:19.797]  What is that?
[01:41:20.398 --> 01:41:24.401]  If you're against health care, what does it have to do
[01:41:26.387 --> 01:41:34.289]  If you're against government-run Obamacare, government-run healthcare, what does it have to do with race?
[01:41:34.409 --> 01:41:36.950]  If you're for government-run healthcare, what does it have to do with race?
[01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:47.753]  If you're against it, they just inject it in there so everybody gets racially obsessed and looking over their shoulder and not trusting each other so the elites can divide and conquer us.
[01:41:49.113 --> 01:41:52.094]  So I don't think Chinese people are inherently bad people.
[01:41:52.794 --> 01:41:54.395]  Their government is corrupt and evil.
[01:41:56.397 --> 01:41:57.238]  I've said it many times.
[01:41:57.258 --> 01:41:58.939]  I don't think Italians are bad people.
[01:41:58.959 --> 01:41:59.659]  They're great people.
[01:42:00.139 --> 01:42:01.660]  But they do have Italian Mafia.
[01:42:02.861 --> 01:42:07.043]  And there's also Jewish Mafia that's very well organized and very dangerous.
[01:42:07.083 --> 01:42:14.107]  And there's Dixie Mafia and WASP Mafia that tends to team up in the last 200 years with Jewish Mafia.
[01:42:15.368 --> 01:42:17.629]  And I'm against those mafias.
[01:42:18.690 --> 01:42:44.952]  But if you address something like Israel is the source of evil, and Israel stages false flags, and Israel does these evil things, and Israel invented evil, and only Israel can do it, and I see exaggeration, I see magical powers being attributed to Israel, and Israel's behind everything, and I see people
[01:42:46.204 --> 01:42:53.152]  Make things up about me that are just entirely untrue, some of the most prominent anti-Israel people.
[01:42:53.713 --> 01:42:57.137]  And then it turns out a lot of them are actually federal agents in the case of Hal Turner and others.
[01:43:00.801 --> 01:43:05.667]  See, they don't want credible criticism of things that Israel does that are wrong.
[01:43:06.775 --> 01:43:12.839]  They want to make it racial or religious or bigoted so that it doesn't have a powerful effect.
[01:43:13.159 --> 01:43:15.461]  So that it isn't palatable to the general public.
[01:43:15.741 --> 01:43:17.342]  So that it isn't constructive.
[01:43:17.923 --> 01:43:20.324]  They want it to be destructive.
[01:43:21.665 --> 01:43:23.687]  And I'm not trying to be destructive here.
[01:43:23.747 --> 01:43:29.791]  I'm trying to be constructive so everyone can live in peace through knowledge and via understanding.
[01:43:33.351 --> 01:43:35.712]  But the truth is, I've studied government history.
[01:43:35.832 --> 01:43:38.894]  The Romans staged false flag attacks.
[01:43:41.736 --> 01:43:45.118]  The Babylonians staged false flag attacks.
[01:43:46.992 --> 01:43:49.093]  Israel stages false flag attacks.
[01:43:49.333 --> 01:43:50.333]  Our government does it.
[01:43:50.733 --> 01:43:51.753]  The Russians do it.
[01:43:52.154 --> 01:43:53.154]  The Tsars did it.
[01:43:53.534 --> 01:43:54.694]  The Communists do it.
[01:43:55.515 --> 01:43:57.295]  The CIA in Vietnam did it.
[01:43:57.375 --> 01:43:58.675]  It's all declassified.
[01:43:58.715 --> 01:44:00.536]  They all do it!
[01:44:01.236 --> 01:44:01.756]  How?
[01:44:02.056 --> 01:44:05.377]  And people say, well, you're giving Israel cover, saying they all do it.
[01:44:05.437 --> 01:44:06.078]  No, I'm not!
[01:44:07.578 --> 01:44:13.900]  It's like every mammal species... I hate to get gross here, but every mammal species leaves droppings.
[01:44:16.121 --> 01:44:24.027]  You know, it's like all butterflies come from caterpillars that then become cocoons.
[01:44:25.268 --> 01:44:27.830]  I mean, all I do is try to state the facts.
[01:44:30.801 --> 01:44:32.641]  And so humans do evil things.
[01:44:32.761 --> 01:44:34.622]  Humans do bad things.
[01:44:35.002 --> 01:44:36.582]  Humans do manipulative things.
[01:44:36.922 --> 01:44:40.723]  And I'm trying to teach people the tricks that are used by humans.
[01:44:41.063 --> 01:44:51.545]  I mean, I guarantee for the big popular anti-Semitic movement that's out there that's, you know, for the last three or four years is, you know, as popular as, you know, sliced bread, basically.
[01:44:52.365 --> 01:44:54.745]  And it's pushed by a lot of different quarters out there.
[01:44:56.205 --> 01:44:58.886]  Let's say every Jew on Earth was teleported
[01:45:00.069 --> 01:45:00.809]  To Pluto.
[01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:03.170]  To freeze to death instantly.
[01:45:04.471 --> 01:45:06.411]  Freeze as hard as a rock in less than one second.
[01:45:07.011 --> 01:45:07.912]  Absolute zero.
[01:45:10.253 --> 01:45:11.673]  Would there be evil anymore?
[01:45:12.273 --> 01:45:13.834]  Would people still beat their kids?
[01:45:14.034 --> 01:45:15.714]  Would banks still be ripping people off?
[01:45:17.435 --> 01:45:18.495]  Would there still be wars?
[01:45:18.515 --> 01:45:19.876]  You better believe there still would be.
[01:45:21.677 --> 01:45:23.957]  And, you know, it's that cop-out.
[01:45:24.918 --> 01:45:28.719]  But let's say we had a global, Hitlerian, anti-Semitic government.
[01:45:30.387 --> 01:45:33.230]  After they'd killed every Jew on earth, what, 18 million Jews?
[01:45:33.550 --> 01:45:35.692]  They would start claiming other people were Jews.
[01:45:36.973 --> 01:45:41.998]  They would start saying that Jews were vampire bats that flapped around at night or something.
[01:45:43.199 --> 01:45:44.260]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:45:45.642 --> 01:45:50.206]  Because it's a system of always blaming some other group, always blaming...
[01:45:52.381 --> 01:46:04.871]  In Africa, every other tribe tries to enslave and kill the other tribe in warfare because that tribe is evil, and that tribe is wicked, and that tribe is manipulative, and that tribe does bad things.
[01:46:04.891 --> 01:46:09.475]  Well, the truth is, your tribe's doing evil things, that tribe's doing evil things.
[01:46:09.795 --> 01:46:11.697]  We need to have a war against evil.
[01:46:12.297 --> 01:46:16.761]  We need to have a war of knowledge so that the people do not perish.
[01:46:18.078 --> 01:46:34.407]  If you cut government, and you inform the general public about the way the world works, and you empower private property, and you empower strength and honor, you're not going to be able to have a corrupt government that is going to come to power no matter who's running it.
[01:46:36.308 --> 01:46:39.369]  No matter who is running that evil government, they're not.
[01:46:39.669 --> 01:46:42.571]  Look, it's because good people are doing nothing.
[01:46:42.911 --> 01:46:44.651]  That's why we're in so much trouble.
[01:46:45.252 --> 01:46:50.174]  There was a really nice lady who was at my daughter's birthday party over the weekend.
[01:46:51.831 --> 01:46:57.116]  And I'd heard about Lakeway, where she lives outside Austin, and why she's in a local homeschool group.
[01:46:58.477 --> 01:47:00.598]  And, you know, this is a nice middle class lady.
[01:47:00.618 --> 01:47:05.262]  These were all, you know, above average income is what I found with homeschoolers.
[01:47:05.863 --> 01:47:09.486]  And she talked about how at Lakeway they gave them forms, and we've got the forms.
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:28.970]  saying that you know under a red alert your children will be taken to a FEMA facility and that they have these drills where they turn the lights off and men come with masks into the rooms with guns and don't tell the kids to drill and the kids get really traumatized and her daughter came home and said I'm not allowed to talk to you without permission from my teacher.
[01:47:29.290 --> 01:47:32.632]  Now I already have mainstream news articles on this in triplicate.
[01:47:33.288 --> 01:47:35.129]  But I, and I said, well, why don't you come on the air?
[01:47:35.450 --> 01:47:37.131]  And she called this morning and said, I'm scared.
[01:47:37.852 --> 01:47:38.932]  I don't want to use my real name.
[01:47:38.952 --> 01:47:40.173]  And I said, that's fine, you don't have to.
[01:47:40.554 --> 01:47:43.096]  And she called again and said, I'm just, I just don't want to do it, period.
[01:47:43.836 --> 01:47:45.718]  And I said, that's fine, I understand you're scared.
[01:47:46.759 --> 01:47:52.003]  But the point is, folks, that this is why we're going to lose, okay?
[01:47:52.563 --> 01:48:01.170]  Because I'm at this party, you know, the birthday party, we had it at my parents, because they've got a pool, pool party.
[01:48:03.021 --> 01:48:14.432]  And there's all these nice, well-to-do, intelligent, professional families, doctors, accountants, lawyers, and they're all from different parts of Austin.
[01:48:16.014 --> 01:48:19.217]  And most of them hadn't even heard of my show.
[01:48:20.198 --> 01:48:21.099]  They're friends with my wife.
[01:48:22.452 --> 01:48:26.715]  And they would talk about how the kids come home crying when they use hot water, saying it's killing animals.
[01:48:27.395 --> 01:48:29.537]  Or when they see a development, they start crying.
[01:48:29.557 --> 01:48:31.058]  And this was lots of mothers and fathers.
[01:48:31.378 --> 01:48:32.358]  This is why they pulled them out.
[01:48:33.339 --> 01:48:36.781]  And how they were trained to hate the Second Amendment.
[01:48:37.762 --> 01:48:39.143]  And how it was happening.
[01:48:39.163 --> 01:48:40.063]  It was every family.
[01:48:40.283 --> 01:48:41.604]  It was all the same horror stories.
[01:48:41.664 --> 01:48:47.368]  Now, I happen to have the Washington Post here.
[01:48:49.906 --> 01:48:51.167]  From four years ago.
[01:48:51.187 --> 01:48:53.028]  No, this is seven years ago.
[01:48:53.948 --> 01:48:55.449]  February 2003.
[01:48:56.010 --> 01:48:57.991]  Schools boost preparations for attack.
[01:48:58.331 --> 01:49:01.173]  Many anti-terror plans would stop parents from picking up children.
[01:49:01.813 --> 01:49:06.736]  Now I happened to, in 98, even before Columbine, get video from Missouri.
[01:49:07.336 --> 01:49:08.237]  We put it up on the web.
[01:49:09.482 --> 01:49:19.472]  We have articles about it, where they would take the kids to FEMA camps in elementary school, secretly, and not even tell the parents that this was going on.
[01:49:19.852 --> 01:49:29.922]  So it doesn't matter if I have her form here, and she told me, it's just to actually hear the mother would be informative.
[01:49:31.561 --> 01:49:35.965]  To actually hear how they were, in the first grade, her daughter was suddenly not talking to her.
[01:49:36.005 --> 01:49:37.967]  And I met her daughter, very sweet little smart little girl.
[01:49:38.447 --> 01:49:40.849]  The teachers were telling them, we are your boss.
[01:49:40.889 --> 01:49:43.051]  You have a California school saying, we are the parents.
[01:49:43.652 --> 01:49:45.073]  You know, we now control your children.
[01:49:46.194 --> 01:49:47.976]  But I see these articles every day.
[01:49:50.215 --> 01:49:52.517]  I mean, I know why they have federal grants for this.
[01:49:52.917 --> 01:49:57.540]  Not just in public schools, and they're almost always with elementary because the kids can't tell what's real and what isn't.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:08.768]  I've had teachers on, where they come in and say, Minneapolis, announce, I'm gonna kill you, have the kids and the teacher march out with their hands behind their heads, and they do simulated executions, not letting them know it was fake.
[01:50:09.673 --> 01:50:21.119]  This is just setting the precedent that the cops can do whatever they want, and they tell them, we're pro-Second Amendment, we're pro-homeschool, we're here to kill you in trauma-based mind control to create an aversion.
[01:50:23.581 --> 01:50:24.361]  What's an aversion?
[01:50:24.621 --> 01:50:26.742]  Let's say you got drunk once on gin.
[01:50:27.183 --> 01:50:33.286]  You smell gin, you don't want to drink it anymore, because you got falling down drunk and threw up for two days.
[01:50:34.815 --> 01:50:40.821]  An aversion is, you know, if a woman's been raped and tortured, that ruins normal, healthy sex for her.
[01:50:41.461 --> 01:50:42.462]  See, it's an aversion.
[01:50:43.803 --> 01:50:46.185]  It's like, ring a bell, hit you in the head with a hammer.
[01:50:46.446 --> 01:50:50.630]  Pretty soon, you ring a bell, people get scared, or you act like you're gonna hit them, they flinch.
[01:50:51.370 --> 01:50:55.874]  They're creating an artificial aversion to the Second Amendment and homeschoolers.
[01:50:55.894 --> 01:50:57.376]  So I'll tell you about that when we get back.
[01:50:57.456 --> 01:50:58.457]  More of your calls, stay with us.

[01:52:01.271 --> 01:52:05.236]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:23.463]  Exclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:52:23.883 --> 01:52:29.445]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:52:29.826 --> 01:52:33.567]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:52:34.048 --> 01:52:38.110]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:43.852]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:52:44.272 --> 01:52:47.174]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:52:47.814 --> 01:52:49.215]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:52:49.796 --> 01:52:50.296]  It's here.

[01:52:59.043 --> 01:52:59.703]  Fatigue.
[01:53:00.184 --> 01:53:00.684]  Headaches.
[01:53:01.305 --> 01:53:02.305]  Allergies and asthma.
[01:53:02.646 --> 01:53:03.566]  Chronic disease.
[01:53:04.067 --> 01:53:05.508]  Is your home making you sick?
[01:53:05.928 --> 01:53:06.509]  Here's a fact.
[01:53:06.849 --> 01:53:14.495]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse, and the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.
[01:53:18.575 --> 01:53:18.775]  We're good.

[01:54:07.606 --> 01:54:18.253]  You know, I talk about this quite a bit because it just gives you a bird's eye view, a window into the mindset of the people running our society.
[01:54:18.273 --> 01:54:23.397]  I thought I'd pull this article up from a few months ago before I get to the new one.
[01:54:23.417 --> 01:54:27.880]  Pharmacy technician sues over fake hostage taking.
[01:54:30.233 --> 01:54:31.034]  This is AP.
[01:54:31.174 --> 01:54:34.176]  A New Jersey pharmacy technician is suing over a training drill.
[01:54:35.196 --> 01:54:36.117]  And it says, Ms.
[01:54:36.157 --> 01:54:43.822]  Perry says in a lawsuit in Burlington County that she was traumatized when a gunman burst into her pharmacy at Hampton Behavioral Health Center.
[01:54:43.882 --> 01:54:48.726]  He said he demanded OxyContin and said he had taken a hostage.
[01:54:49.186 --> 01:54:51.588]  The gun wasn't real and the gunman worked for the company.
[01:54:53.029 --> 01:54:55.610]  And it said that the insurance company funded him to do this.
[01:54:59.178 --> 01:55:01.139]  They didn't tell her it was a fake robbery.
[01:55:01.199 --> 01:55:05.682]  Folks, that is hardcore trauma to have somebody come in and aim a gun at you.
[01:55:05.722 --> 01:55:09.264]  Now, remember, this is going on with elementary students every day.
[01:55:10.285 --> 01:55:11.326]  And here was the bigger issue.
[01:55:11.706 --> 01:55:13.287]  Most of the parents didn't even know.
[01:55:13.427 --> 01:55:14.427]  Oh, that was the other issue.
[01:55:15.768 --> 01:55:19.731]  At the elementary school out by Lake Travis,
[01:55:23.311 --> 01:55:26.118]  They didn't tell the parents they had done it.
[01:55:26.599 --> 01:55:29.045]  And the parents, when the woman talked to them, were like zombies.
[01:55:30.655 --> 01:55:39.839]  Imagine, they turn the lights off, a man comes in and says he's gonna kill you, and doesn't tell you it's a drill, and the kids are all crying, totally horrified, freaked out, and begged to not go back to school.
[01:55:40.259 --> 01:55:41.480]  Has nothing to do.
[01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:43.220]  Oh, and they claim it's for gunmen.
[01:55:43.461 --> 01:55:46.422]  Yeah, teach the kids how to go underneath desks and be killed.
[01:55:46.742 --> 01:55:49.983]  Not get out the windows, flee, or teachers are armed.
[01:55:50.223 --> 01:55:52.925]  No, train your kids how to be helpless.
[01:55:53.085 --> 01:55:54.325]  Learned helplessness.
[01:55:54.345 --> 01:55:58.427]  So there's a lot of different facets, but in these drills they also tell them, I'm a gun group.
[01:55:58.627 --> 01:55:59.668]  I'm a homeschooler group.
[01:55:59.828 --> 01:56:00.548]  I don't like you.
[01:56:00.849 --> 01:56:01.749]  That's in the AP.
[01:56:01.969 --> 01:56:04.431]  They tell them, I'm here from the homeschooling group.
[01:56:05.372 --> 01:56:10.355]  So the kids now, when they hear homeschool, or hear Second Amendment, they think of torture.
[01:56:10.815 --> 01:56:11.696]  They think of pain.
[01:56:11.936 --> 01:56:13.657]  They think of a man threatening to kill them.
[01:56:14.098 --> 01:56:14.818]  Now here's a new one.
[01:56:18.501 --> 01:56:19.581]  Las Vegas Sun.
[01:56:19.702 --> 01:56:22.944]  Hospital uses armed man in unannounced drill.
[01:56:23.084 --> 01:56:25.866]  Test of security procedures results in frightening moments.
[01:56:27.145 --> 01:56:31.889]  I'm going to cover this when we come back in the next hour, and then a few more calls, then Webster Tarpley is joining us.
[01:56:31.909 --> 01:56:38.434]  There's a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to as well here today.
[01:56:40.094 --> 01:56:45.557]  But before I go any further, I wanted to thank a couple of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[01:56:45.877 --> 01:56:54.321]  Number one, my books and videos and material that we offer on the online video slash apparel store at Infowars.com.
[01:56:54.361 --> 01:57:00.764]  It is your purchase of the videos that makes all of my future films and websites and radio show possible.
[01:57:01.084 --> 01:57:02.445]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:57:06.852 --> 01:57:14.579]  So, again, please visit InfoWars.com and check out the books and t-shirts and videos and material because, number one, they wake people up.
[01:57:14.599 --> 01:57:17.002]  Number two, it funds our operation here.
[01:57:17.102 --> 01:57:18.023]  We couldn't do it without you.
[01:57:19.204 --> 01:57:21.866]  Also, sponsors like SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:57:21.886 --> 01:57:27.452]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[01:57:28.288 --> 01:57:30.030]  There's a war on against hybrid seeds.
[01:57:30.050 --> 01:57:36.998]  The UN, Bill Gates, and others buy up the old heirloom seed lines and shut them down while hoarding them for themselves.
[01:57:37.999 --> 01:57:39.280]  Now's the time to be planting.
[01:57:40.081 --> 01:57:44.326]  Get one survival seed bank for yourself, get another for friends and family, or get another to save.
[01:57:44.606 --> 01:57:46.768]  But whatever you do, get involved in gardening today.
[01:57:47.549 --> 01:57:48.970]  SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:50.430]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:57:50.450 --> 01:57:54.813]  Or call and get a free information package or order the seeds by calling 877-327-0365.
[01:57:54.833 --> 01:57:54.873]  877-327-0365.
[01:57:54.933 --> 01:57:56.433]  Then of course there's another great sponsor.
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:10.404]  Again, this is Alex Jones, and if you heard of the Millionaire Patriot, it has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:58:10.804 --> 01:58:14.366]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute.
[01:58:14.686 --> 01:58:17.528]  Secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[01:58:17.869 --> 01:58:22.932]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:58:23.332 --> 01:58:31.678]  I believe now is the time for you and your family to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement military standards without any boot camp or tough guy drill instructor attitudes.
[01:58:31.978 --> 01:58:32.879]  That's FrontSight.com.
[01:58:32.919 --> 01:58:34.560]  Front Sight, like the front of your
[01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:36.062]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:36.082 --> 01:58:37.765]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.359 --> 01:58:58.487]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:58:58.847 --> 01:59:09.297]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:59:09.738 --> 01:59:15.183]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:59:15.723 --> 01:59:20.206]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[01:59:20.606 --> 01:59:29.332]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:59:29.672 --> 01:59:39.519]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[01:59:39.799 --> 01:59:42.961]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:59:43.482 --> 01:59:44.482]  Silverlungs.com.
[01:59:52.228 --> 01:59:54.130]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.610 --> 01:59:57.552]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.157 --> 02:00:12.644]  So, all over the United States, and the western world for that matter, they have paramilitary takeover drills.
[02:00:15.735 --> 02:00:19.658]  And here's another one out of the Las Vegas Sun today.
[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:28.423]  Hospital uses armed man in unannounced drill.
[02:00:29.163 --> 02:00:34.327]  Test of security procedures results in frightening moments.
[02:00:36.109 --> 02:00:38.831]  How's this for an ill-conceived emergency preparedness drill?
[02:00:38.891 --> 02:00:40.352]  It's always ill-conceived.
[02:00:40.432 --> 02:00:41.933]  Like, oh, this was the first time it happened.
[02:00:41.953 --> 02:00:42.834]  Yeah, tens of thousands.
[02:00:43.474 --> 02:00:53.141]  An off-duty cop pretending to be a terrorist stormed a hospital intensive care unit brandishing a handgun, which he points at nurses while herding them down a corridor into a room.
[02:00:55.199 --> 02:00:57.180]  Folks, this is part of the handbook.
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:00:58.760]  Oh, you complained?
[02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:00.000]  Usually people don't.
[02:01:00.881 --> 02:01:02.041]  That's testing the mind control.
[02:01:02.521 --> 02:01:04.682]  Oh, this was the first time ever it was an accident.
[02:01:04.962 --> 02:01:08.583]  Not a federal grant or anything to teach you learned helplessness.
[02:01:10.283 --> 02:01:14.524]  There are harrowing moments, he explains, that the whole caper was a training exercise.
[02:01:15.384 --> 02:01:16.225]  The staff at St.
[02:01:16.305 --> 02:01:24.367]  Rose Dominican Hospital at the Siena campus, where the incident took place Monday morning, found the exercise more traumatizing than intrusive.
[02:01:25.575 --> 02:01:26.335]  That's instructive.
[02:01:26.876 --> 02:01:31.559]  Hospital employees would have been justified in fearing for their own lives.
[02:01:31.679 --> 02:01:33.460]  Well, what about shooting him?
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:35.881]  See, this is the problem, folks.
[02:01:36.702 --> 02:01:38.523]  What if somebody did an unannounced drill here?
[02:01:40.544 --> 02:01:42.485]  I mean, a man in a mask runs in here with a gun?
[02:01:43.466 --> 02:01:45.167]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to reach right here.
[02:01:45.887 --> 02:01:48.329]  I'm going to pull out a .357 Magnum and I'm going to open fire.
[02:01:50.413 --> 02:01:59.068]  In fact, they've had three cases in the last decade when they have this yearly drill upwards of 100 miles outside of Fort Bragg.
[02:02:02.455 --> 02:02:05.796]  They have a military that tries to disarm police on duty.
[02:02:06.396 --> 02:02:08.116]  And the cops have killed them in every case.
[02:02:08.897 --> 02:02:11.877]  And the military always says, well, they thought the cops were part of the drill.
[02:02:12.497 --> 02:02:13.318]  This is lunacy.
[02:02:13.558 --> 02:02:14.358]  But it's not lunacy.
[02:02:14.378 --> 02:02:15.398]  There's a method to the madness.
[02:02:15.438 --> 02:02:17.519]  It's about saying, we can do whatever we want.
[02:02:17.559 --> 02:02:23.120]  Now, again, their favorite place to do it is elementary students, because they don't know how to talk to mommy.
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:29.324]  They come home and go, ah, drill, man with gun, and mommy goes, good, your learning guns are bad.
[02:02:29.344 --> 02:02:31.586]  But daddy has gun and gun case.
[02:02:31.646 --> 02:02:32.446]  Don't worry, honey.
[02:02:32.746 --> 02:02:35.008]  You'll never have to be near that gun and never get taken, honey.
[02:02:35.428 --> 02:02:37.790]  We're going to be part of the disarmed culture of slaves.
[02:02:38.170 --> 02:02:39.051]  Thank you, mommy.
[02:02:39.271 --> 02:02:40.352]  Oh, it's so scary.
[02:02:41.813 --> 02:02:42.774]  This is the mind control.
[02:02:44.082 --> 02:02:47.244]  Hospital employees would have been justified in fearing for their lives.
[02:02:47.364 --> 02:02:48.584]  Well, they were fearing for their lives.
[02:02:49.385 --> 02:02:54.127]  Just last year, Henderson Police shot and killed an armed, hostile man in the emergency room.
[02:02:54.487 --> 02:02:58.549]  So it would make sense that security and emergency preparedness had been focused on the hospital.
[02:02:58.929 --> 02:03:07.733]  But in Monday's incident, which occurred in a unit that houses the hospital's sickest patients, nurses, patients, and their families did not know it was a drill.
[02:03:08.313 --> 02:03:09.194]  And it goes on from there.
[02:03:11.255 --> 02:03:11.435]  So,
[02:03:16.843 --> 02:03:21.247]  The larger issue here is that this is going on at all.
[02:03:22.207 --> 02:03:31.695]  And that's the larger point that I want to discuss, that I want to talk to people about out there that are conditioning.
[02:03:31.715 --> 02:03:33.016]  You are under mind control.
[02:03:33.116 --> 02:03:37.359]  You are being manipulated systematically.
[02:03:41.397 --> 02:03:43.919]  Being aware of this manipulation is half the battle.
[02:03:44.259 --> 02:03:58.768]  The other half of the battle is going into your school districts, wherever you're located, going into your communities and explaining, you're not going to traumatize my children, you're not going to manipulate them, you're not going to put sodium fluoride in my water.
[02:03:59.228 --> 02:04:00.649]  I have a CBS News clip.
[02:04:01.109 --> 02:04:08.135]  That I was sent, where they admit that the water has hundreds of toxic chemicals added to it, massively increasing cancer in major studies.
[02:04:08.175 --> 02:04:11.357]  So, now they're even admitting it's poison, but they stick it in our water.
[02:04:12.198 --> 02:04:13.319]  It's forced medication.
[02:04:16.281 --> 02:04:21.645]  I've seen national polls where upwards of 80 plus percent of Americans don't want sodium fluoride in their water.
[02:04:22.006 --> 02:04:23.967]  Well, why do you still buy fluoride toothpaste?
[02:04:24.307 --> 02:04:25.368]  Why do you still drink it?
[02:04:25.668 --> 02:04:26.829]  Why do you still put up with it?
[02:04:26.849 --> 02:04:28.070]  I mean, is this our country?
[02:04:29.051 --> 02:04:30.633]  Or is it the eugenicists?
[02:04:30.794 --> 02:04:32.596]  Is it the social engineers?
[02:04:32.736 --> 02:04:33.457]  Is it theirs?
[02:04:33.978 --> 02:04:37.302]  Do they get to do whatever they want, whenever they want?
[02:04:38.284 --> 02:04:42.089]  You know, that's the larger question that we have to discuss.
[02:04:42.109 --> 02:04:45.133]  I'm going to hit some more economic news.
[02:04:46.209 --> 02:04:51.811]  Get in some other military news, and we're going to talk to Webster Tarpeley about Geithner telling the Chinese the U.S.
[02:04:51.871 --> 02:04:53.692]  is basically financially done.
[02:04:53.712 --> 02:04:54.732]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:55.252 --> 02:04:56.513]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:04:56.553 --> 02:05:01.915]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:05:02.155 --> 02:05:06.757]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:05:07.157 --> 02:05:07.557]  It's true.
[02:05:07.637 --> 02:05:12.199]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:05:12.739 --> 02:05:17.442]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:05:17.963 --> 02:05:19.884]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:05:20.264 --> 02:05:24.887]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:05:25.067 --> 02:05:25.988]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:26.188 --> 02:05:28.970]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:32.572]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:05:32.893 --> 02:05:35.714]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:05:36.075 --> 02:05:37.976]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:05:38.296 --> 02:05:39.217]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:05:42.859 --> 02:05:44.640]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:05:45.820 --> 02:05:51.603]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:05:51.923 --> 02:05:54.364]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:05:55.365 --> 02:06:00.807]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:06:02.008 --> 02:06:06.790]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:07.150 --> 02:06:08.611]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[02:06:11.226 --> 02:06:13.948]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:15.869 --> 02:06:19.252]  They sow pride in every stitch.
[02:06:19.932 --> 02:06:22.114]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:06:24.372 --> 02:06:28.235]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:06:28.955 --> 02:06:32.098]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:06:32.798 --> 02:06:33.599]  Others don't.
[02:06:34.019 --> 02:06:35.920]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:37.682]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:37.962 --> 02:06:40.524]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:06:40.844 --> 02:06:47.108]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:06:47.468 --> 02:06:49.670]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:06:50.170 --> 02:06:52.212]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[02:06:52.552 --> 02:06:53.413]  Others don't.
[02:06:56.443 --> 02:06:58.185]  And you're subject to other police action.
[02:06:58.985 --> 02:06:59.886]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:00.246 --> 02:07:03.789]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:03.909 --> 02:07:06.391]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:06.411 --> 02:07:11.856]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:12.276 --> 02:07:18.524]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:18.945 --> 02:07:24.492]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:24.932 --> 02:07:28.597]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:07:29.097 --> 02:07:33.079]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:38.903]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:39.343 --> 02:07:42.285]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:42.885 --> 02:07:44.306]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:44.866 --> 02:07:45.346]  It's here.
[02:07:45.987 --> 02:07:52.791]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:56.971 --> 02:08:02.982]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:03.603 --> 02:08:06.569]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:14.434 --> 02:08:18.397]  We will continue with phone calls in this fourth and final hour.
[02:08:18.458 --> 02:08:19.619]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:08:20.359 --> 02:08:26.004]  We have economist and, of course, a doctor of history, Webster Griffin Tarpley, joining us.
[02:08:26.044 --> 02:08:29.227]  He's one of our regular guest analysts here.
[02:08:29.707 --> 02:08:37.794]  We will also get to at least Jimmy, Matt, George, Brad, Blue Dove, and a few others that are holding in this hour.
[02:08:39.135 --> 02:08:51.122]  But I wanted to first get into the economy with Webster, then we'll get his take on the Gaza flotilla and what he believes from his research is really going on there.
[02:08:51.142 --> 02:08:55.445]  Although it may be too soon to tell, but we're getting a clearer and clearer picture on that.
[02:08:56.025 --> 02:09:02.169]  We do have members of the Israeli Knesset coming out, and that's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:09:02.509 --> 02:09:07.312]  Key article by Steve Watson, Israel Knesset member, Israel
[02:09:07.992 --> 02:09:11.433]  Wanted high number of fatalities, that was said in the Knesset.
[02:09:12.053 --> 02:09:27.298]  The same member is saying that five minutes before the boarding of the main ship, a converted cruise ship, under a Turkish flag, that the Israelis were firing not just tear gas and rubber bullets and flashbangs, but actual lead rounds.
[02:09:28.018 --> 02:09:29.359]  So that is coming up.
[02:09:30.359 --> 02:09:35.541]  And we will also, with Webster Tarpley, get into the North Korean peninsula.
[02:09:35.601 --> 02:09:47.126]  Wayne Madsen and many others who I respect believe that it's a German torpedo from the blueprints, compared to the guts of the torpedo that survived, some of the remnants.
[02:09:47.686 --> 02:09:49.127]  And this is a false flag.
[02:09:50.427 --> 02:09:53.069]  Focused at Japan, who's trying to kick U.S.
[02:09:53.129 --> 02:09:54.590]  forces out right now.
[02:09:54.671 --> 02:10:11.585]  But all of the analysts, whether it's Dr. Paul Craig-Roberts or Gerald Cilente or myself or Webster Tarpley, all of our experts and the RAND Corporation's own statements two years ago stated to get their world government, to have the banking cartel be able to successfully
[02:10:12.845 --> 02:10:17.486]  Submit their power and get away with the robberies they've committed during this global meltdown.
[02:10:17.806 --> 02:10:29.108]  They're going to need a new war as the political smokescreens of the public get scared and rallies around the flag which the bankers will wrap themselves in like a enchilada or something.
[02:10:29.909 --> 02:10:32.029]  So we're going to discuss that with Webster as well.
[02:10:32.429 --> 02:10:34.690]  But here's some of the financial headlines.
[02:10:35.210 --> 02:10:36.510]  Euro to go under.
[02:10:37.770 --> 02:10:41.931]  $1.20 almost certainly, lowest in four years.
[02:10:42.371 --> 02:10:45.012]  Volatility to dominate stock markets in June.
[02:10:46.272 --> 02:10:53.414]  Spain loses its AAA rating, meaning they'll have to pay more to the private bankers for their already out-of-control debts.
[02:10:55.335 --> 02:10:57.455]  California talking about losing its rating.
[02:10:57.815 --> 02:10:58.956]  Many counties already have.
[02:10:58.976 --> 02:11:02.857]  The U.S., Moody's saying pretty much certain will lose its AAA rating.
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:07.582]  You've just got every economic number coming in.
[02:11:08.223 --> 02:11:08.823]  Here's another one.
[02:11:08.884 --> 02:11:13.227]  Poll finds debt-dogged Americans are stressed out.
[02:11:13.848 --> 02:11:22.736]  The economy trudges ahead, yet debt dogs many Americans, stressing them out even as they firm up their own financial foundations.
[02:11:23.096 --> 02:11:24.197]  So you've got the spin there.
[02:11:24.498 --> 02:11:26.579]  Real unemployment upwards of 23 percent.
[02:11:26.619 --> 02:11:26.980]  They claim 9.8.
[02:11:30.823 --> 02:11:50.794]  I mean, all the economic numbers, and you're out there in the real world, folks, you see them, show that things are just deteriorating and that we're in a depression, while the media keeps saying, no, this is a recovery because the big central banks and JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, the zombie banks, they're all making record profits.
[02:11:50.854 --> 02:11:53.796]  So the whole world is gauged by how they're doing.
[02:11:54.456 --> 02:12:00.218]  So let's get into that first, because I saw Tarpley on international television over the weekend.
[02:12:00.238 --> 02:12:02.979]  We had it up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:12:03.879 --> 02:12:13.282]  And I saw the news anchor report that Tim Geithner has announced that China has to find a new trading partner because the U.S.
[02:12:13.342 --> 02:12:16.303]  public and private debt is so maxed out that U.S.
[02:12:16.343 --> 02:12:18.464]  citizens won't be a market for them in the future.
[02:12:18.784 --> 02:12:20.745]  I mean, that's like saying we're dead on arrival.
[02:12:21.445 --> 02:12:37.856]  Now even if that was true, which globalization and NAFTA and GATT has caused by design, I mean this was always the plan, why announce it and say you better have Europe as your trading partner when they're even, according to the numbers I've seen,
[02:12:39.039 --> 02:12:46.502]  In the same or greater debt, on a nation-by-nation basis it varies, but overall about the same level as the United States.
[02:12:46.562 --> 02:12:48.363]  So why is Geithner running around?
[02:12:48.403 --> 02:12:56.786]  Well, I sure enough did a lot of searching and found a video clip of it and a French news agency report where he was quoted as saying U.S.
[02:12:56.826 --> 02:13:00.848]  consumers are going to be less a source of demand in the world in the future.
[02:13:01.428 --> 02:13:10.310]  So this is the statement of these Malthusian individuals where they state, we want a post-industrial United States.
[02:13:10.430 --> 02:13:17.411]  So let's talk about the state of the world economy because we've gotten almost a fatigue.
[02:13:17.791 --> 02:13:21.452]  So have I. I've just become comfortable now at a subconscious level.
[02:13:21.892 --> 02:13:22.652]  Humans are like that.
[02:13:22.672 --> 02:13:23.753]  We're resilient.
[02:13:24.073 --> 02:13:28.874]  If we're around bad things or around bad news, we tend to get calloused mentally to it.
[02:13:30.074 --> 02:13:31.155]  Me and my wife are resigned.
[02:13:31.215 --> 02:13:32.997]  Okay, it's going to be an ongoing depression.
[02:13:33.317 --> 02:13:34.839]  Things are going to get ten times worse.
[02:13:35.359 --> 02:13:36.581]  Our children have no future.
[02:13:36.981 --> 02:13:38.122]  Everything's going to collapse.
[02:13:38.723 --> 02:13:46.371]  If we want to fly, the naked body scanners, where they now admit they record your genitalia and laugh at you and put it on government databases, they now admit that.
[02:13:46.711 --> 02:13:47.392]  They don't care.
[02:13:48.833 --> 02:13:51.376]  The government is going to raise our taxes to give it to foreign banks.
[02:13:52.737 --> 02:13:59.582]  So, we're just sitting here basting in the evil, and the rest of the world has gotten to this point, but there is resistance mounting.
[02:13:59.962 --> 02:14:01.083]  So, there's my rant.
[02:14:01.663 --> 02:14:07.367]  Let's go to economist Webster Tarpley to get his breakdown on all these facets that I've thrown out.
[02:14:07.427 --> 02:14:16.213]  But A, what does it mean when Geithner, Tiny Tim, comes out and announces to China, hey, America is sunk.
[02:14:17.867 --> 02:14:24.889]  Well, we first of all have to recognize that Geithner has many sides to his mouth and he talks out of all of them more or less at the same time.
[02:14:24.949 --> 02:14:33.492]  We cannot approach a serious analysis of the world economy through the various lies and tricks and swindles that Geithner comes up with because on this last trip
[02:14:33.972 --> 02:14:34.313]  We're good.
[02:14:56.796 --> 02:15:01.059]  From a historical point of view is behaving very much like the depression of 1929, 1931, 1933.
[02:15:01.139 --> 02:15:04.602]  We're about a year and a half into the acute phase of the depression.
[02:15:05.223 --> 02:15:07.965]  And just like in 1931, when we had the banking crisis in Europe,
[02:15:14.611 --> 02:15:17.972]  The second phase of the Depression is the collapse of Europe.
[02:15:18.012 --> 02:15:26.135]  That was true in the period between May and September of 1931, the bankruptcies of Austria, Germany, and then the Bank of England.
[02:15:26.175 --> 02:15:27.335]  The British did default.
[02:15:27.375 --> 02:15:32.677]  The British did go bankrupt, quite contrary to things that you'll see that they haven't gone bankrupt since.
[02:15:33.698 --> 02:15:34.639]  1672.
[02:15:33.978 --> 02:15:34.639]  They did.
[02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:37.804]  And that was the second round of the World Depression.
[02:15:38.204 --> 02:15:46.796]  That in those days led then into a banking panic here in the United States, which shut down every bank, which followed really less than half a year after that.
[02:15:46.876 --> 02:15:48.699]  So we're in the collapse of Europe phase.
[02:15:50.441 --> 02:15:51.181]  It's a depression.
[02:15:51.562 --> 02:15:52.682]  It's a disintegration.
[02:15:53.023 --> 02:15:58.126]  This is not a market event in the sense of a business cycle or anything of the sort.
[02:15:58.546 --> 02:16:00.768]  It's an emergency of world civilization.
[02:16:01.428 --> 02:16:03.970]  And it has to be fought with a recovery program.
[02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:06.272]  Yeah, and I know you always want to get into your recovery program.
[02:16:06.292 --> 02:16:08.673]  We'll do that before you leave, but we have a lot to cover.
[02:16:08.693 --> 02:16:09.954]  I want to go over... Right, right, right.
[02:16:09.994 --> 02:16:10.975]  I want to meet the Webster.
[02:16:11.015 --> 02:16:13.137]  I want to go over your take, though, on what's happening currently.
[02:16:13.157 --> 02:16:13.557]  Fine, fine.
[02:16:13.957 --> 02:16:17.900]  We proved this in the United States in the 1930s, so you shouldn't be resigned to a depression.
[02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:19.601]  Depressions can be fought and should be fought.
[02:16:19.641 --> 02:16:23.564]  Now, Geithner personally has been on this trip.
[02:16:23.604 --> 02:16:27.547]  Now, he was in China attempting to manage relations with China.
[02:16:28.367 --> 02:16:36.253]  Not very effectively, but I think the big thing was he had to rush to Germany to try to defend this bankrupt system.
[02:16:36.313 --> 02:16:41.577]  Now, the system is based on globalization, and that means, in practice, hot money,
[02:16:42.327 --> 02:16:55.071]  Then the supremacy of hot money, the supremacy of hot money, speculation, derivatives, gambling bets, the casino economy, and the destruction of productivity, deregulation, privatization.
[02:16:55.251 --> 02:17:03.334]  Yeah, the supremacy of the central banks being able to issue any amount of made-up derivatives, counterfeit money, to buy up whatever assets they want.
[02:17:04.254 --> 02:17:09.036]  My issue specifically, though, is what was, as a parlor trick,
[02:17:09.796 --> 02:17:19.609]  What is the point of telling the truth and saying we have indebted the American people so much, they're not going to be able to buy your widgets anymore, and you say he failed in China.
[02:17:19.629 --> 02:17:25.457]  I mean, they did say that they're now going to move towards increasing the value of their currency.
[02:17:25.517 --> 02:17:27.499]  Is that not a successful mission?
[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:30.600]  It's going to take a long, long time.
[02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:31.861]  It's going to be very gradual.
[02:17:32.041 --> 02:17:33.421]  And watch out what you wish for.
[02:17:33.841 --> 02:17:41.402]  The Chinese currency peg means that they have to buy dollars to support, to keep the currency peg the way they want it.
[02:17:41.442 --> 02:17:50.444]  So, ironically, the Chinese currency peg is likely to be one of the last factors supporting the dollar against a panic crash.
[02:17:50.504 --> 02:17:54.625]  And if that were completely removed, the dollar would crash down even further.
[02:17:55.725 --> 02:18:00.530]  What are the partners lobbying for because there's no industry left, or is this just all phlegm phlegm?
[02:18:00.610 --> 02:18:03.272]  What's the real agenda then of these people?
[02:18:03.332 --> 02:18:10.659]  And in the short term, Webster, as folks want to know, looking into your crystal ball, many of our guests predicted Europe would collapse next in the last two years.
[02:18:11.060 --> 02:18:19.428]  It has, but we always know that there's a separate effect where it will next bring us down as well, or will it hit Asia next?
[02:18:20.209 --> 02:18:26.955]  The principal thing that is being done now is that the dollar was collapsing all during the second half of last year.
[02:18:26.975 --> 02:18:32.760]  It looked like the dollar was going to lose any residual status as a reserve currency.
[02:18:32.780 --> 02:18:41.688]  So not part of a long-term plan, but as an immediate short-term expedient, a desperate bid to save the dollar from total collapse.
[02:18:42.208 --> 02:18:45.670]  They began the attack on Europe, on Greece.
[02:18:45.710 --> 02:18:49.153]  It actually started with Dubai around Thanksgiving of last year.
[02:18:49.253 --> 02:18:57.398]  Once that happened, they began to lift and shift and move into this hedge fund attack on Europe, assisted by credit default swaps.
[02:18:57.418 --> 02:19:00.220]  So the goal was, save the dollar for the coming year.
[02:19:00.681 --> 02:19:07.645]  And in order to do that, they had to export some of the more acute aspects of the depression from London and New York.
[02:19:07.685 --> 02:19:09.827]  They had to get that into Frankfurt.
[02:19:10.407 --> 02:19:19.913]  I mean, the Germans have come out, our own government admits that they're in there raiding, the private brokerage firms are in there raiding Europe, causing this, and what are they doing?
[02:19:20.053 --> 02:19:23.555]  Stalling until they can start their new Iranian war?
[02:19:23.575 --> 02:19:28.819]  I don't think these people have a time horizon beyond three to six months, quite frankly.
[02:19:28.839 --> 02:19:30.560]  I think their system is out of control.
[02:19:30.900 --> 02:19:32.901]  They're wildly flailing in all directions.
[02:19:32.962 --> 02:19:39.646]  They're an image of a ruling class gone mad with no plan and no design but just these short-term tricks.
[02:19:41.024 --> 02:19:44.267]  All right, Webster, I want to shift gears into the flotilla.
[02:19:44.867 --> 02:19:47.890]  Well, we want to do the German part, which was the main thing.
[02:19:48.030 --> 02:19:49.071]  Okay, stay there then.
[02:19:49.591 --> 02:19:52.313]  We'll cover the Germans now moving to block some of this.
[02:19:52.874 --> 02:19:55.536]  Then we'll get into what's happening in the Mediterranean, then North Korea.
[02:19:56.451 --> 02:19:59.035]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:19:59.455 --> 02:20:04.422]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:20:04.782 --> 02:20:06.525]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:20:06.845 --> 02:20:11.271]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:20:12.999 --> 02:20:13.760]  When do you want it?
[02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:15.741]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:20:16.021 --> 02:20:16.841]  When will you need it?
[02:20:17.082 --> 02:20:19.143]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:20:19.283 --> 02:20:20.383]  Will there be any food?
[02:20:20.624 --> 02:20:21.964]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:20:22.164 --> 02:20:27.227]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:20:27.428 --> 02:20:30.009]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food.
[02:20:31.254 --> 02:20:31.414]  I think?
[02:20:55.581 --> 02:20:56.681]  Are you prepared?
[02:20:56.942 --> 02:20:59.042]  Well, you need to be hardcore prepared.
[02:20:59.242 --> 02:21:00.323]  There is a difference.
[02:21:00.623 --> 02:21:06.225]  To be hardcore prepared, equip yourself with the latest survival gear available at tacktowngear.com.

[02:21:59.721 --> 02:22:00.662]  Tyranny is here.
[02:22:01.003 --> 02:22:04.568]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:22:04.648 --> 02:22:07.131]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:22:07.151 --> 02:22:12.338]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:22:13.131 --> 02:22:19.235]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:22:19.675 --> 02:22:25.239]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:22:25.639 --> 02:22:29.362]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:22:29.842 --> 02:22:33.865]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:22:34.125 --> 02:22:39.689]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:22:40.089 --> 02:22:43.031]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:22:43.612 --> 02:22:45.035]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:22:45.596 --> 02:22:46.077]  It's here.

[02:22:54.577 --> 02:22:54.978]  Good day.
[02:22:55.218 --> 02:22:56.760]  Jim Newcomer from Idus Resources.
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:57.260]  June 1st, 2010.
[02:22:57.320 --> 02:22:58.241]  Gold opened this morning at $1225.40.
[02:22:58.282 --> 02:23:01.626]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1258.07, $629.03 for a half-ounce, or $314.52 for the quarter-ounce.
[02:23:01.666 --> 02:23:02.146]  That's $1258.07, $629.03, or $314.52.
[02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.642]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[02:23:17.082 --> 02:23:21.005]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[02:23:21.385 --> 02:23:26.009]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:23:26.269 --> 02:23:29.771]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold.
[02:23:30.032 --> 02:23:34.775]  Discussing costs, benefits, risks, the book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:23:37.797 --> 02:23:40.999]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.

[02:23:51.244 --> 02:23:51.544]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:24:04.201 --> 02:24:05.982]  Alright, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:07.103 --> 02:24:08.264]  Webster Tarpley's our guest.
[02:24:08.324 --> 02:24:22.034]  I want to get into the larger geopolitical structure of things, but we know, ahead of any global financial collapse, the Anglo-American powers, based out of London, the United States, Europe, always launch a new war.
[02:24:22.354 --> 02:24:28.018]  And all of our experts, and I've studied this as well, that's what I concur with, they're going to need a new war.
[02:24:28.118 --> 02:24:31.561]  And just notice all this stuff is suddenly popping up, very suspicious.
[02:24:32.341 --> 02:24:39.686]  But finishing up, Germany has dared declare that they're not going to fit the bill, mainly to bail out France.
[02:24:39.706 --> 02:24:45.450]  We're now learning that most of the money, they've already paid to fix, supposedly, the debt of Greece.
[02:24:45.670 --> 02:24:51.294]  And so German central bankers and German newspapers are saying, where is our money going?
[02:24:51.314 --> 02:24:57.218]  Just like our Congress says, wait, you said this $800-plus billion was for the TARP.
[02:24:57.238 --> 02:24:59.399]  This TARP money is for the mortgages.
[02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:01.561]  Where did you spend it?
[02:25:02.701 --> 02:25:10.105]  The main thing is we've had a large economic power of the world, Germany, which is usually the world's number one exporter right now.
[02:25:24.813 --> 02:25:26.194]  You've always said ban those.
[02:25:48.477 --> 02:25:49.298]  I'm very gratified.
[02:25:49.318 --> 02:25:50.719]  And naked shorting.
[02:25:50.839 --> 02:25:52.060]  And naked shorting.
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:52.561]  Right.
[02:25:52.801 --> 02:26:05.912]  So they say if you want to buy, if you want to place a bet, a credit default swap on a bond issued by one of the Euro land countries, there are 16 countries that are in the Euro.
[02:26:06.432 --> 02:26:13.236]  You've got to own those euros, those bonds yourself, before you can buy a bet on them.
[02:26:13.276 --> 02:26:17.178]  Because the argument always is, well, we just use these as hedging for insurance.
[02:26:17.198 --> 02:26:18.658]  So fine, you're going to hedge.
[02:26:18.939 --> 02:26:21.420]  You've got to be in there with skin in the game.
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:23.621]  You've got to have some of those bonds in your possession.
[02:26:23.701 --> 02:26:29.784]  So the net effect of this is to make certain kinds of credit default swaps illegal, banned, outlawed.
[02:26:30.625 --> 02:26:33.166]  And, you know, I don't know whether it's jail time or what it is.
[02:26:33.386 --> 02:26:41.593]  And you must do it because the bankers can go in and tens of billions of dollars a day manipulate markets and never really invest anything.
[02:26:41.753 --> 02:26:42.333]  Absolutely.
[02:26:42.674 --> 02:26:44.735]  They can do this at a distance from afar.
[02:26:45.035 --> 02:26:53.642]  Now, Rush Limbaugh every day is telling everybody how great the banks are, how wonderful Wall Street is, and how, I guess, credit default swaps are really your friend.
[02:26:54.083 --> 02:27:00.188]  Just remember, if you're upset about the $180 billion US dollars that was given to AIG,
[02:27:01.068 --> 02:27:12.216]  That was all because of one hedge fund, the AIG hedge fund in London, that issued credit default swaps to the tune of, well, along with other derivatives, three trillion U.S.
[02:27:12.296 --> 02:27:14.957]  dollars, about as much as the gross domestic product of France.
[02:27:14.997 --> 02:27:26.305]  Now, the other one is in the Goldman Sachs scandal that we've just had with the synthetic CDOs, the way in which Goldman Sachs bet against their own product, so-called, was using credit default swaps.
[02:27:26.785 --> 02:27:29.809]  And we have the one example of Timberwolf where it's all premeditated.
[02:27:29.849 --> 02:27:31.090]  So let's understand this.
[02:27:31.651 --> 02:27:35.916]  They're not, since they already destroyed the world economy, they're not slowing down.
[02:27:36.176 --> 02:27:41.683]  They're accelerating the looting because they're vampire zombies as you so well lay out the analogy.
[02:27:41.963 --> 02:27:42.884]  They can't stop.
[02:27:42.924 --> 02:27:44.086]  They've got to have blood.
[02:27:44.306 --> 02:27:45.587]  They're never going to stop.
[02:27:45.648 --> 02:27:46.388]  It's us or them.
[02:27:47.049 --> 02:27:47.489]  Precisely.
[02:27:47.529 --> 02:28:04.097]  So the Germans have, they surprised everybody on Tuesday the 19th of May, I guess it was, by saying, it was 5 o'clock in the afternoon in Frankfurt, and they said, guess what, at midnight Central European time, naked credit default swaps are illegal on Eurozone bonds.
[02:28:04.817 --> 02:28:11.179]  And you're not allowed to short, to do naked shorting, of the ten largest financial stocks in Germany, right?
[02:28:11.219 --> 02:28:14.580]  Starting with the banks, insurance companies, reinsurance, and so forth.
[02:28:14.620 --> 02:28:25.183]  And the reason for this is that the speculative attack of the hedge funds, of the various Soroses and Greenlight Capital and the rest of them, is done through credit default swaps.
[02:28:25.243 --> 02:28:29.784]  It's a very efficient way to get a big panic going for a very small investment.
[02:28:29.884 --> 02:28:33.266]  Germany understands this is economic warfare and they're not going along with it.
[02:28:33.286 --> 02:28:34.486]  So this is a huge development.
[02:28:34.566 --> 02:28:35.787]  Precisely.
[02:28:36.487 --> 02:28:42.390]  And they've got a bill in the parliament now which says no naked shorting of any German stock.
[02:28:42.470 --> 02:28:44.851]  Any stock primarily listed on a German exchange.
[02:28:44.971 --> 02:28:45.852]  No naked shorts.
[02:28:46.292 --> 02:28:50.915]  No naked shorts of Eurozone bonds and no naked shorting of the Euro itself.
[02:28:50.955 --> 02:28:54.157]  So all of this is to put up firewalls against these speculators.
[02:28:54.217 --> 02:29:01.501]  In other words, they're in the process now of re-regulating their marketplace, getting away from the insanity of this free market, free trade.
[02:29:01.681 --> 02:29:05.022]  If this spreads, this is a lot bigger than Greece fighting back or Iceland.
[02:29:05.042 --> 02:29:07.722]  If this spreads, this could spell the end of these people.
[02:29:07.762 --> 02:29:10.583]  Now, separately, here in the United States, it's the opposite.
[02:29:10.883 --> 02:29:20.405]  They passed their new bank regulation bill, and it gives the megabanks the power to gobble up more small banks, healthy banks that weren't involved in all of that.
[02:29:20.726 --> 02:29:25.507]  So, Webster, I want you to see how the lines converge, where you see this going on the other side.
[02:29:25.527 --> 02:29:30.088]  Then we've got to shift gears, as I promised, and go to some phone calls.
[02:29:30.988 --> 02:29:34.690]  And talk about the war situation globally.
[02:29:34.730 --> 02:29:38.411]  Things are really heating up on the Korean Peninsula and in the Mediterranean.
[02:29:38.992 --> 02:29:41.593]  The Israelis, what are they doing picking a fight with Turkey?
[02:29:41.893 --> 02:29:43.794]  Turkey says they're sending warships in.
[02:29:43.954 --> 02:29:44.974]  This is getting wild!
[02:29:45.795 --> 02:29:46.715]  We're on the march.
[02:29:47.195 --> 02:29:48.796]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:49.737 --> 02:29:52.418]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:55.762 --> 02:29:58.363]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:29:58.783 --> 02:30:03.725]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:30:04.105 --> 02:30:05.825]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:30:06.146 --> 02:30:10.967]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:11.147 --> 02:30:12.108]  How much do you want?
[02:30:12.328 --> 02:30:13.068]  When do you want it?
[02:30:13.448 --> 02:30:15.050]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:30:15.330 --> 02:30:16.151]  When will you need it?
[02:30:16.411 --> 02:30:18.473]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:18.613 --> 02:30:19.714]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:19.955 --> 02:30:21.276]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:21.476 --> 02:30:26.541]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:30:26.742 --> 02:30:29.885]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:30.325 --> 02:30:33.827]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:30:34.147 --> 02:30:35.127]  How much will you need?
[02:30:35.367 --> 02:30:35.987]  We don't know.
[02:30:36.268 --> 02:30:37.188]  How much do you want?
[02:30:37.388 --> 02:30:38.108]  All you can get.
[02:30:38.308 --> 02:30:39.149]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:39.389 --> 02:30:42.150]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:30:44.231 --> 02:30:45.131]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:58.821]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[02:31:48.425 --> 02:31:50.987]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[02:31:51.308 --> 02:31:52.108]  Check them out today.
[02:31:54.911 --> 02:31:59.155]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:59.475 --> 02:32:03.559]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:03.819 --> 02:32:09.244]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:09.564 --> 02:32:10.005]  It's true.
[02:32:10.285 --> 02:32:15.730]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:19.273]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:19.573 --> 02:32:24.057]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:24.297 --> 02:32:26.659]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:27.059 --> 02:32:30.442]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:31.523 --> 02:32:35.406]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:35.646 --> 02:32:40.407]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:40.707 --> 02:32:44.728]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:44.868 --> 02:32:46.449]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:46.669 --> 02:32:48.749]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:48.909 --> 02:32:51.270]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:13.591 --> 02:33:17.074]  We've got 27 minutes left here in broadcast.
[02:33:17.094 --> 02:33:18.335]  Thank you again for joining us.
[02:33:18.395 --> 02:33:19.175]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.195 --> 02:33:22.898]  The websites are infowars.com.
[02:33:23.118 --> 02:33:28.362]  I-N-F-O-W-A-R-S.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:33:29.502 --> 02:33:34.623]  We are fighting the formation of the prison planet through the info war.
[02:33:35.163 --> 02:33:36.203]  We're not left or right.
[02:33:37.664 --> 02:33:38.484]  We're freedom lovers.
[02:33:39.064 --> 02:33:39.924]  We're truth tellers.
[02:33:39.984 --> 02:33:41.544]  We are a society of truth.
[02:33:41.864 --> 02:33:43.585]  We're looking for the truth.
[02:33:44.205 --> 02:33:52.107]  And the truth is, in all races, colors, creeds, we are one race, the human race, reaching towards the stars.
[02:33:52.587 --> 02:33:58.868]  And we have in us the most horrible things and we have the greatest things as well, all within us as a human community.
[02:33:59.608 --> 02:34:09.513]  And I'm trying to get people to realize there's an agenda going on around them, that there is a power elite on this planet that does not have your best interest at heart.
[02:34:09.633 --> 02:34:10.834]  I mean, it's just that simple.
[02:34:11.194 --> 02:34:15.617]  And that you need to get involved in your daily life and stand up for your freedom.
[02:34:16.137 --> 02:34:20.799]  You know, you can't have the attitude, oh, it's too big, things are too corrupt, what could little old me do?
[02:34:21.340 --> 02:34:28.644]  Well, if little old me doesn't start doing a little something, we know we're in deep trouble, we know things are only going to get worse.
[02:34:29.324 --> 02:34:32.225]  Because the truth is, little old you isn't little old you.
[02:34:32.545 --> 02:34:34.866]  You have great power and history has shown that.
[02:34:36.327 --> 02:34:41.649]  That's why we have a scientific dictatorship racing to block off every avenue of human escape.
[02:34:42.629 --> 02:34:46.571]  But they're not godlike, they're not invincible, they're not in full control.
[02:34:47.955 --> 02:34:50.175]  In fact, they're losing control.
[02:34:50.536 --> 02:34:54.196]  They are delusional, believing that they can dominate and control us.
[02:34:54.796 --> 02:35:01.218]  It doesn't matter how much surveillance, how much oppression they have, if you stand up and say no, this tyranny will come crashing down.
[02:35:01.538 --> 02:35:08.339]  We then have to replace it with our Americanism, with our freedom, with our liberty, with our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[02:35:08.659 --> 02:35:09.679]  We have to replace it.
[02:35:09.759 --> 02:35:10.819]  I'm a restorationist.
[02:35:10.939 --> 02:35:12.800]  I want my liberties and freedoms back.
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:13.760]  I'm not a revolutionary.
[02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:15.981]  We're fighting revolutionaries.
[02:35:16.001 --> 02:35:17.941]  We're firing piratical revolutionaries.
[02:35:18.241 --> 02:35:25.264]  Going back to Webster Tarpley and then your phone calls here in just a moment, but I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's radio broadcast possible.
[02:35:26.164 --> 02:35:28.225]  One of them is Ecolablue.com.
[02:35:28.885 --> 02:35:31.907]  Did you know you can be drinking fresh, clean water made right out of the air you breathe?
[02:35:31.947 --> 02:35:33.787]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[02:35:34.147 --> 02:35:39.930]  Our sponsor, Ecolablue, with the Ecolablue 28 and their brand new Ecolablue 30 machines will allow you to do just that.
[02:35:40.410 --> 02:35:43.431]  It's easy to use and will make up to 7.5 gallons of water per day.
[02:35:44.031 --> 02:35:47.592]  The water once generated passes through 7 or 12, depending on the unit you get.
[02:35:47.972 --> 02:35:55.075]  Stage filtering process, including reverse osmosis and carbon filtration techniques, ensuring that you know exactly what you are drinking.
[02:35:55.115 --> 02:35:57.016]  No chemicals, pollutants, or fluoride.
[02:35:57.276 --> 02:35:59.857]  We spend so much time talking about on this radio broadcast.
[02:36:00.297 --> 02:36:04.278]  Check them out at Ecolablue, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[02:36:04.318 --> 02:36:06.939]  Ecolablue dot com, or give them a call at 800-691-7000.
[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:09.902]  6043 to get an information packet or to order 800-691-6043.
[02:36:09.962 --> 02:36:10.623]  Take action today.
[02:36:10.663 --> 02:36:12.787]  And one other sponsor that I just love is Weapons Universe.
[02:36:23.129 --> 02:36:33.637]  And they've got tasers, they've got pocket knives, they've got swords, from ornamental to the real thing, and they've got great prices, and they are patriots.
[02:36:34.277 --> 02:36:36.979]  Weapons-Universe.com.
[02:36:37.300 --> 02:36:40.382]  That's Weapons-Universe.com.
[02:36:40.682 --> 02:36:47.287]  Whether you need knives or stun guns, blow guns, collapsible batons, they have it all at Weapons-Universe.com.
[02:36:47.307 --> 02:36:49.369]  They have authentic movie replica swords,
[02:36:50.029 --> 02:36:53.692]  Like that awesome folded steel Conan sword I showed you once.
[02:36:54.252 --> 02:36:56.573]  It's weapons-universe.com.
[02:36:56.974 --> 02:36:58.154]  Check them out today.
[02:36:58.415 --> 02:36:59.435]  And why do we love weapons?
[02:36:59.475 --> 02:37:03.818]  Because it's the mark of a free man and a serious check and balance against tyranny.
[02:37:04.258 --> 02:37:07.521]  But you first have to have the initiative to peaceably speak out.
[02:37:08.041 --> 02:37:15.326]  Because if you won't speak out peaceably when we're in this realm of conflict, you certainly aren't going to stand up if it goes to something physical.
[02:37:15.666 --> 02:37:17.367]  Which we're trying to avert each and every day.
[02:37:17.427 --> 02:37:19.229]  Okay, Webster, I promise to go to calls.
[02:37:19.249 --> 02:37:20.290]  We appreciate your time.
[02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:21.931]  But I need to move quickly here.
[02:37:21.971 --> 02:37:23.692]  So finish up... Alex, one last thing now.
[02:37:23.712 --> 02:37:29.737]  So the big thing is, Geithner goes to Germany and he tries to beat up the German finance minister, Schäuble.
[02:37:30.077 --> 02:37:34.340]  And he basically says to him, take back your ban on these derivatives, right?
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:36.222]  We believe derivatives are sacrosanct.
[02:37:36.622 --> 02:37:38.023]  Get your hands off our derivatives!
[02:37:38.443 --> 02:37:40.805]  And Schauble tells them to get lost, to scram.
[02:37:40.845 --> 02:37:42.286]  So the clash is set up.
[02:37:42.326 --> 02:37:47.030]  There's a meeting of the group of 20 finance ministers in Seoul, South Korea this week.
[02:37:47.370 --> 02:37:48.331]  The clash goes on.
[02:37:48.731 --> 02:37:56.457]  And then there's going to be this international, the group of eight, the big industrial countries in Ottawa in July.
[02:37:57.037 --> 02:37:59.661]  But as long as that's done domestically, it's okay.
[02:37:59.681 --> 02:38:00.522]  We don't want the U.N.
[02:38:15.453 --> 02:38:16.314]  We don't want the U.N.
[02:38:16.374 --> 02:38:17.194]  running the Tobin Tax.
[02:38:17.214 --> 02:38:19.375]  Not the U.N., not the IMF, none of this.
[02:38:19.735 --> 02:38:20.556]  The country is needed.
[02:38:20.616 --> 02:38:24.118]  Everybody says, oh, there's a deficit crisis in all these countries.
[02:38:24.438 --> 02:38:28.500]  And finally, rules against hedge funds, because we've had enough of these hedge funds.
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:33.143]  So, the basic idea is, you're hearing a lot of people say, this is a crisis of the welfare state.
[02:38:33.183 --> 02:38:34.524]  That is absolute baloney.
[02:38:35.304 --> 02:38:37.905]  The Greeks have 18% unemployment.
[02:38:38.486 --> 02:38:39.666]  They have 20% poverty.
[02:38:39.726 --> 02:38:42.027]  Spain has 20% unemployment.
[02:38:42.047 --> 02:38:45.029]  The IMF comes in and says, you guys are profligate.
[02:38:45.249 --> 02:38:46.930]  We have an austerity program for you.
[02:38:46.990 --> 02:38:48.070]  You're going to get gouged.
[02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:49.171]  We give the money.
[02:38:49.853 --> 02:38:57.219]  To the bailouts, because as you correctly point out, the bailout of Greece is really a bailout of French and German banks, not of Greece at all.
[02:38:57.459 --> 02:39:03.084]  So what is failing is this globalized casino economy of derivatives, hedge funds, and hot money.
[02:39:03.144 --> 02:39:03.904]  That's what's failing.
[02:39:03.924 --> 02:39:07.247]  Well, Webster, let's go back to 19 months ago, back in October.
[02:39:07.327 --> 02:39:09.309]  They said we need these trillions of dollars.
[02:39:10.290 --> 02:39:13.574]  Uh, or the entire economy is going to go into a depression.
[02:39:13.894 --> 02:39:15.216]  It's to unfreeze mortgages.
[02:39:15.597 --> 02:39:20.563]  And then the next day, the next day, literally, they say, we're not spending it on that now.
[02:39:21.124 --> 02:39:22.606]  We're not going to tell you where it's going.
[02:39:22.666 --> 02:39:24.448]  So, so, but I mean, just briefly.
[02:39:25.325 --> 02:39:27.366]  How do you see the power structure breaks?
[02:39:27.866 --> 02:39:30.508]  Because we saw the concerted bailout a year and a half ago.
[02:39:31.548 --> 02:39:33.449]  Now we see fissures cracking here.
[02:39:33.950 --> 02:39:40.393]  Because you're right when you say that these investment banks and brokerage firms can't control themselves.
[02:39:40.693 --> 02:39:44.776]  They're even attacking the national governments now that give them all this power.
[02:39:44.796 --> 02:39:47.237]  And then you have what appears to be delusion.
[02:39:48.017 --> 02:39:56.283]  Many of the top globalists running around saying we'll just form a world government where the banks have all the power and where we have SDRs where we just make up our own money.
[02:39:56.303 --> 02:40:04.589]  But then you have Brzezinski, and I want to get your take on this, two weeks ago, saying, look, for the first time the whole world is awake to us.
[02:40:04.949 --> 02:40:06.290]  We're in trouble.
[02:40:06.350 --> 02:40:14.116]  So it appears that they are having trouble in their concerted actions and that the wheels are beginning to come off.
[02:40:14.136 --> 02:40:15.417]  So what do you say about Brzezinski?
[02:40:15.959 --> 02:40:21.162]  I think we're headed towards a world now where, in the immediate short run, you're going to have two blocks.
[02:40:21.202 --> 02:40:22.963]  There's going to be the derivatives block.
[02:40:23.303 --> 02:40:26.264]  The people who say derivatives are the basis of human civilization.
[02:40:26.564 --> 02:40:27.245]  That's the U.S.
[02:40:27.305 --> 02:40:27.805]  and the British.
[02:40:28.165 --> 02:40:37.410]  Then there's the anti-derivatives block saying, no, as Schauble says, production of goods and services has to be the basis of human civilization, not
[02:40:38.348 --> 02:40:39.629]  And by the way,
[02:41:08.123 --> 02:41:08.804]  They've said that.
[02:41:08.844 --> 02:41:10.425]  I mean, you read their own documents.
[02:41:10.445 --> 02:41:12.487]  We're interviewing you for the next film on this subject.
[02:41:12.927 --> 02:41:24.577]  But they want a global eugenics Malthusian capital where we're literally in loincloths, those that they allow to live, while they fly above us like Skynet with drones.
[02:41:24.617 --> 02:41:26.279]  I mean, they make these... It doesn't work.
[02:41:26.359 --> 02:41:27.920]  It will never work this way.
[02:41:27.940 --> 02:41:31.263]  In other words, they will lose control of everything long before that.
[02:41:31.323 --> 02:41:31.944]  The problem is,
[02:41:32.724 --> 02:41:36.288]  This existing ruling class of financiers, because that's who they are, right?
[02:41:36.308 --> 02:41:42.635]  Wall Street, City of London, people... They drank their own Kool-Aid because it's... They ruled the world, and they believe that their power is eternal.
[02:41:42.935 --> 02:41:46.038]  They will be swept away at some point or other in this entire thing.
[02:41:46.218 --> 02:41:52.545]  The problem is that they can drag down human civilization into some kind of a catastrophic breakdown crisis and collapse.
[02:41:53.125 --> 02:41:54.246]  And we're all in the soup.
[02:41:54.286 --> 02:41:59.508]  So, the point is, remember from the 1930s, depression, dictatorship, world war.
[02:41:59.848 --> 02:42:01.369]  We're still in the depression phase.
[02:42:01.769 --> 02:42:09.133]  If you fight to stop the depression with a recovery program, you can avoid the dictatorship phase and you can avoid the world war phase.
[02:42:09.393 --> 02:42:10.813]  But you've got to fight the depression.
[02:42:10.833 --> 02:42:14.275]  You can't say, let the free market take care of it, balance the budget.
[02:42:14.315 --> 02:42:16.296]  That is absolutely suicidal nonsense.
[02:42:16.809 --> 02:42:18.671]  Well, I mean, there's no doubt this is not a free market.
[02:42:18.691 --> 02:42:21.975]  This is crony, insider capitalism.
[02:42:22.816 --> 02:42:28.222]  But now, Webster, let's move very quickly now, because I promise to go to these calls and get your take on their questions.
[02:42:29.564 --> 02:42:33.729]  To me, I mean, we've been expecting a war, at least a regional war.
[02:42:34.230 --> 02:42:36.672]  All these big think tanks say we need a war.
[02:42:37.713 --> 02:42:40.716]  During these crises, we need a war.
[02:42:41.657 --> 02:42:47.201]  Right now, as a political diversion, we see the North Korea situation, we see the Gaza flotilla.
[02:42:47.962 --> 02:42:50.884]  What is going on here from your research?
[02:42:51.625 --> 02:42:52.546]  What do you see happening?
[02:42:53.426 --> 02:43:00.088]  I think the main thing that you see is, first of all, that the world depression behind the scenes is destroying countries.
[02:43:00.148 --> 02:43:08.310]  If you look at what happened in Thailand, I think that's an example of a country going into a breakdown crisis because of the collapse of the world economy around it.
[02:43:08.330 --> 02:43:10.831]  In other words, the multiplication of failed states.
[02:43:11.371 --> 02:43:15.732]  Now the other thing concerning maybe the Middle East and Iran in particular,
[02:43:16.332 --> 02:43:17.953]  You can see that the U.S.
[02:43:18.053 --> 02:43:20.995]  is losing world domination at a very rapid rate.
[02:43:21.956 --> 02:43:30.981]  You have, for example, Karzai in Afghanistan playing the China card, essentially slipping into the Chinese orbit, making economic deals with China.
[02:43:31.462 --> 02:43:41.828]  All over the Middle East, you've got the Chinese on an economic offensive, you've got the Iranians on a religious and cultural offensive, and the U.S.
[02:43:41.868 --> 02:43:44.950]  really has nothing to offer against that except
[02:43:45.550 --> 02:43:46.030]  A launch point.
[02:44:12.987 --> 02:44:14.348]  Then you look at the Ukraine.
[02:44:14.788 --> 02:44:17.129]  The color revolution has been rolled back.
[02:44:17.309 --> 02:44:18.749]  Ukraine is no longer a candidate.
[02:44:18.769 --> 02:44:21.050]  The Georgia attack failed on South Ossetia.
[02:44:21.650 --> 02:44:24.671]  Ukraine has decided that they don't want to join NATO.
[02:44:24.731 --> 02:44:29.553]  Instead, they've made another long-term deal to host the Russian fleet in the ports of the Black Sea.
[02:44:29.873 --> 02:44:32.654]  In Iran, the color revolution has failed there too.
[02:44:33.054 --> 02:44:34.195]  What you're seeing is the U.S.
[02:44:34.275 --> 02:44:40.917]  forced more and more back on the only option, naked military force with no moral basis.
[02:44:41.517 --> 02:44:43.880]  In the point where it's not even clear if that will work.
[02:44:43.940 --> 02:44:51.890]  Now if you look specifically, countries like Egypt, the Chinese economic penetration of Egypt is going very fast.
[02:44:52.851 --> 02:44:53.952]  You've also got Turkey.
[02:44:53.972 --> 02:45:01.381]  Now one of the things that's happening is as the US power recedes, you've got the emergence either of regional superpowers,
[02:45:01.921 --> 02:45:02.502]  We're good to go.
[02:45:16.795 --> 02:45:17.035]  I don't
[02:45:31.932 --> 02:45:34.554]  England and the Dutch replaced it.
[02:45:35.154 --> 02:45:56.067]  We're already seeing the United States used up and literally losing its power as the Chinese and the Germans and others come in as the new technocratic suppliers with soft power and are literally colonizing these third world and old world areas with high-tech versions of glass baubles.
[02:45:57.007 --> 02:46:01.270]  Just remember, though, that there's no ultimate reason for the U.S.
[02:46:01.310 --> 02:46:09.075]  decline except our own folly in allowing Wall Street financiers to make all the main decisions in this society, right?
[02:46:09.095 --> 02:46:16.500]  The reason the Chinese get ahead is that they have a much more industrial goods-producing manufacturing...
[02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:33.050]  I don't understand, but Tarpley, Tarpley, Tarpley, specifically, because we're almost out of time, I want to get your take on Israel's activity and Turkey openly threatening, saying they're sending warships, four frigates in, to protect the next aid ship, and saying this could mean war.
[02:46:33.670 --> 02:46:37.933]  And I think Israel is out of control enough, they may attack Turkey now.
[02:46:38.618 --> 02:46:44.240]  Well, what the Israelis have done, of course, is a very serious breach of international law.
[02:46:44.480 --> 02:46:46.901]  It's either an act of war or it's a crime.
[02:46:47.381 --> 02:46:51.523]  In any case, it has to be condemned, and it is being condemned all around the world.
[02:46:51.543 --> 02:46:54.144]  The Israelis are more isolated than they've ever been.
[02:46:54.924 --> 02:47:00.926]  And I think in addition to the criminal aspect of this under international law,
[02:47:01.838 --> 02:47:05.020]  You also have to wonder, what are the Israelis thinking?
[02:47:05.100 --> 02:47:07.061]  Where do they think this leads?
[02:47:07.381 --> 02:47:15.045]  They've lost sight of the fact that if you don't have a moral basis for force, this is going to be bankrupt and it's not going to get anywhere.
[02:47:15.065 --> 02:47:23.109]  Now usually, the Israelis would expect that the United States would shield them from the negative blowback in the UN and so forth.
[02:47:23.149 --> 02:47:27.392]  What I'm seeing right now is the US may already be too weak
[02:47:28.112 --> 02:47:29.173]  Security Council!
[02:47:46.853 --> 02:47:49.154]  These are both temporary members of the Security Council.
[02:47:49.494 --> 02:48:06.961]  They were the ones that tried to get Iran to make an arrangement to send some of their uranium into Turkey and have it enriched there, and then sent back to them as fuel rods for this research reactor, which has attracted so much attention.
[02:48:07.282 --> 02:48:07.922]  And the U.S.
[02:48:08.342 --> 02:48:12.264]  had nothing to say to that, even though this was exactly what the U.S.
[02:48:12.304 --> 02:48:15.445]  had asked for six months earlier, and kept saying they wanted.
[02:48:16.085 --> 02:48:18.228]  And then they just say, no, that's no good anymore.
[02:48:18.248 --> 02:48:20.391]  And this is just, it makes absolutely no sense.
[02:48:20.772 --> 02:48:32.348]  When you start alienating countries like Turkey and Brazil, when these are now regional superpowers, you're getting to a situation where this entire U.S.-British imperial edifice
[02:48:32.808 --> 02:48:33.128]  We're good.
[02:48:50.495 --> 02:48:58.102]  Yeah, all the ships were inspected, and all the Israelis can show is some four-inch, five-inch knives, and they're now calling those WMDs.
[02:48:58.122 --> 02:49:00.184]  The Israelis have found no guns.
[02:49:00.204 --> 02:49:02.206]  There are no weapons, no explosives.
[02:49:02.226 --> 02:49:03.367]  They've undoubtedly gone through it.
[02:49:03.408 --> 02:49:10.955]  I would be very skeptical if they come up with any, because the ship, in particular the large ship, was loaded under the supervision of the Turkish government.
[02:49:10.995 --> 02:49:13.517]  So, a NATO crisis simply is that
[02:49:14.498 --> 02:49:17.000]  Turkey is one of the most important NATO countries.
[02:49:17.020 --> 02:49:19.842]  You look at that Incirlik Air Force Base, right?
[02:49:20.002 --> 02:49:25.105]  That's the key for the whole Iranian and Middle East presence of the United States.
[02:49:25.185 --> 02:49:30.709]  Generally speaking, without the NATO logistics and military basing infrastructure, the U.S.
[02:49:30.889 --> 02:49:35.272]  is logistically so weak that it could not project any kind of power into the Middle East.
[02:49:35.292 --> 02:49:36.472]  Well, here's the issue.
[02:49:36.532 --> 02:49:41.696]  The Anglo-American, U.S.-Israel, British Empire isn't going to back off.
[02:49:42.496 --> 02:49:46.558]  They're arrogant because they've got a plan, and I believe it's to start a nuclear war.
[02:49:47.019 --> 02:49:49.480]  Now enter what happened in Korea.
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:51.421]  Does that smell like a false flag to you?
[02:49:51.781 --> 02:50:08.910]  Yes, obviously the suspicion around this is very grave, because the main idea is that, as a general proposition, it's absolutely clear that the United States has always used North Korea and the North Korean military nuclear issue
[02:50:09.896 --> 02:50:20.221]  As a means of keeping South Korea in line and Japan, especially during all the stuff going on with Afghanistan and then mainly Iraq.
[02:50:20.562 --> 02:50:22.042]  The thing that kept the U.S.
[02:50:22.102 --> 02:50:30.467]  position solid or relatively solid in the Far East was the fact that North Korea was there and everybody had to be afraid of them.
[02:50:31.347 --> 02:50:36.252]  If they've now gone one step further and actually done something, it's not clear whether they have.
[02:50:36.572 --> 02:50:37.813]  But that would fit perfectly.
[02:50:37.913 --> 02:50:41.436]  It could be a mine left over from the war of 60 years ago.
[02:50:41.736 --> 02:50:47.461]  It could be a torpedo fired by somebody, maybe by... We know a big multi... We know a big U.S.
[02:50:48.562 --> 02:50:51.525]  slash South Korean drill was going on in these waters.
[02:50:51.865 --> 02:50:54.648]  When this happens, stay there Webster, we'll try to get to some calls.
[02:50:56.169 --> 02:50:57.210]  Don't answer it!
[02:50:58.015 --> 02:51:06.100]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[02:51:13.985 --> 02:51:18.007]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[02:51:48.530 --> 02:51:48.831]  That's 800-477-9256.
[02:51:55.051 --> 02:51:59.913]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:00.033 --> 02:52:00.813]  What have we got?
[02:52:01.013 --> 02:52:03.134]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:03.454 --> 02:52:04.214]  A republic.
[02:52:04.474 --> 02:52:07.035]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:07.115 --> 02:52:09.035]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:09.375 --> 02:52:11.296]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:11.416 --> 02:52:12.676]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:13.097 --> 02:52:14.197]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:14.417 --> 02:52:14.797]  Children?
[02:52:15.017 --> 02:52:15.797]  Our education?
[02:52:16.138 --> 02:52:16.778]  Our money?
[02:52:16.958 --> 02:52:20.599]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:20.979 --> 02:52:24.640]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:24.680 --> 02:52:25.660]  You're being warned!
[02:52:25.960 --> 02:52:26.781]  We have the facts.
[02:52:26.981 --> 02:52:28.081]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:28.141 --> 02:52:29.021]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:29.041 --> 02:52:29.881]  We have common law.
[02:52:29.922 --> 02:52:32.182]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:32.462 --> 02:52:35.163]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[02:52:35.403 --> 02:52:36.263]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:36.343 --> 02:52:41.125]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:41.305 --> 02:52:42.645]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:42.805 --> 02:52:43.625]  Don't Tread on Me.
[02:52:43.885 --> 02:52:45.126]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:55.094 --> 02:52:58.137]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?

[02:53:02.381 --> 02:53:05.844]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:53:06.104 --> 02:53:12.590]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine,
[02:53:14.414 --> 02:53:14.654]  I think so.

[02:53:47.565 --> 02:53:48.246]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[02:53:59.657 --> 02:54:06.680]  We're almost out of time, and I've got a lot of other informative guests coming up throughout the week, but I'm going to have to block off maybe some whole shows this week.
[02:54:07.060 --> 02:54:09.381]  Probably do nothing but take calls, because I apologize.
[02:54:09.401 --> 02:54:10.642]  I shouldn't even open the phones up.
[02:54:11.322 --> 02:54:14.784]  I'm not going to get to your calls, Matt, George, Brad, Blue Dove, Ken.
[02:54:14.864 --> 02:54:15.864]  I apologize to you all.
[02:54:16.365 --> 02:54:18.706]  I'll try to get to one or two, and then be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:54:18.746 --> 02:54:19.886]  Central, 12 noon Eastern.
[02:54:20.727 --> 02:54:22.407]  But we're going to go to those here in just a second.
[02:54:22.427 --> 02:54:25.309]  But Webster, finishing up, before we take a call or two,
[02:54:26.629 --> 02:54:37.355]  I mean, this is exactly what we keep talking about month in, month out, is how, at the key point of crisis, these interests are going to start wars, and then voila, everything that's happening makes no sense.
[02:54:38.656 --> 02:54:43.398]  I mean, why would North Korea do this right at the perfect time to keep the U.S.
[02:54:43.478 --> 02:54:46.340]  there when the U.S.
[02:54:46.380 --> 02:54:48.701]  was about to be kicked out of Japan?
[02:54:49.740 --> 02:54:53.862]  It makes no sense at all, and there's going to be an international investigation.
[02:54:53.902 --> 02:54:58.104]  I think there's a group of Russian experts who are looking into it, and you'd probably need others, too.
[02:54:58.164 --> 02:54:59.484]  It would have to be multinational.
[02:54:59.864 --> 02:55:07.227]  Just in terms of the Middle East, though, I think it's time for the Israelis to realize that they've come to the end of the line with the current policy.
[02:55:07.668 --> 02:55:11.969]  They should immediately end the blockade of Gaza, which is the main issue here.
[02:55:12.750 --> 02:55:15.591]  And I think the Israeli people have to realize that
[02:55:16.131 --> 02:55:19.612]  Netanyahu is a luxury they cannot afford.
[02:55:19.632 --> 02:55:34.857]  In other words, this kind of incompetent domination, it reminds us of the terrible price paid by the Israelis for the Rabin assassination, and then the kinds of leaders that they've had after the killing of Rabin 15 years ago.
[02:55:35.057 --> 02:55:39.259]  And I think their situation is, like many other parts of the world, including our own,
[02:55:39.859 --> 02:55:47.321]  The political elite has absolutely lost touch with reality and with the needs of the population at large.
[02:55:47.341 --> 02:55:48.481]  Well, this attack shows that.
[02:55:48.521 --> 02:56:02.264]  I mean, what a PR disaster to do something like this, or at least stop the ship when it docked and walk up and talk nicely to them and say you've got, you know, but no, I mean, just none of this.
[02:56:03.804 --> 02:56:10.733]  And now you've got members of the Knesset coming out saying, no, Israel did fire first, so they ran the white flag up.
[02:56:10.773 --> 02:56:14.797]  I mean, this is amazing, brazen behavior.
[02:56:15.218 --> 02:56:21.045]  It's Netanyahu and then some members of his coalition that are even less in touch with reality than he is.
[02:56:21.585 --> 02:56:27.911]  Notice that the ships, some of them were sponsored by Mahathir Mohammed, the former Prime Minister of Malaysia.
[02:56:28.371 --> 02:56:35.878]  They were loaded in Turkey, Ireland, and Greece under the supervision, obviously, of the police and intelligence services of those countries.
[02:56:36.218 --> 02:56:38.500]  There are no firearms on board.
[02:56:38.820 --> 02:56:42.523]  The Israelis have now got a large group of prisoners, right?
[02:56:42.543 --> 02:56:43.084]  They've got 480 prisoners.
[02:56:44.845 --> 02:56:50.368]  And according to, one of them is a famous Swedish writer by the name of Henning Mankell, well known over there.
[02:56:50.828 --> 02:56:58.432]  He says he was given a choice to either sign a document and be deported, and he didn't want to sign it, or be put on trial.
[02:56:58.492 --> 02:57:02.714]  I think if they try to put some of these people on trial, that will have a terrible effect.
[02:57:02.734 --> 02:57:04.935]  The Israelis say that they're transferring 124 to Jordan.
[02:57:04.975 --> 02:57:08.016]  There are more ships coming.
[02:57:08.156 --> 02:57:13.599]  Apparently there's an Irish ship which is still on its way, and Mahathir Mohammed said last night that there are ships
[02:57:14.179 --> 02:57:19.522]  Sponsored by Malaysia, which are coming from farther away, which will continue to arrive.
[02:57:19.542 --> 02:57:21.643]  So there's no end to this, right?
[02:57:21.723 --> 02:57:34.169]  And the Knesset member says that Israel wanted blood to intimidate people, but as the blitz showed in London and in many other wars, when you really start brutalizing people at a certain point, it makes them get more angry.
[02:57:34.609 --> 02:57:36.029]  It doesn't have the desired effect.
[02:57:36.110 --> 02:57:42.633]  And now Turkey, I mean, that's a bold move to say they're sending four frigates and destroyers
[02:57:43.473 --> 02:57:50.119]  But with these new ships, I mean, this is Webster, this is how world wars start.
[02:57:50.860 --> 02:57:56.846]  It's a very dangerous situation, and again, the people in Israel would be very well advised not to turn away from the current path.
[02:57:57.407 --> 02:58:00.810]  The best thing to do is announce an immediate end to the Gaza blockade.
[02:58:00.830 --> 02:58:02.812]  This makes no sense anymore.
[02:58:03.252 --> 02:58:11.497]  That would probably lead to the fall of Netanyahu, maybe early elections or something like this, and then hopefully a government that would be prepared to negotiate.
[02:58:11.537 --> 02:58:13.078]  Alright, Webster, we're out of time.
[02:58:13.518 --> 02:58:14.039]  God bless you.
[02:58:14.059 --> 02:58:14.919]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:58:14.939 --> 02:58:15.099]  Bye-bye.
[02:58:15.119 --> 02:58:16.040]  Folks, thank you.

[02:58:18.481 --> 02:58:20.843]  The two books on Obama, the book on the economic crash.
