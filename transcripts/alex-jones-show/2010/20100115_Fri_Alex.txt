[00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:01.911]  You want answers?
[00:00:02.692 --> 00:00:03.592]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:07.856]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:08.437 --> 00:00:12.521]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:16.685 --> 00:00:23.812]  She was in the Republican debate last night with Kay Bailey Hutchinson, the Senator, and Governor Rick Perry.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.971]  She is a registered nurse in Texas, a patriot, part of the End the Fed Movement with Ron Paul.
[00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.841]  She's running for governor, and she really impressed people.
[00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:39.904]  I listened to WOAI, WBAP, and NewsRadio 590 KLBJ this morning.
[00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:41.946]  Every caller was calling in.
[00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.046]  Every caller.
[00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:47.830]  And I listened for an hour and a half to different stations, was saying, I want Deborah Medina.
[00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.210]  I'm sick of Rick Perry.
[00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:51.212]  I'm sick of Kay Bailey Hutchinson.
[00:00:51.232 --> 00:00:56.615]  These are establishment, big government, fake conservatives masquerading as Tea Party people.
[00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:59.958]  We want the bona fide, real deal Deborah Medina.
[00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:03.860]  And she said the right thing on property taxes on the Second Amendment.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.661]  She was confident.
[00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:09.122]  She was authoritative in the calm way.
[00:01:10.183 --> 00:01:15.205]  She really put the reporters back on their heels that were trying to savage her, who were asking the questions.
[00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:16.226]  She's with us for the next 30 minutes.
[00:01:16.246 --> 00:01:20.548]  We're going to get her in studio in the next week or so when she's here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:21.589 --> 00:01:27.011]  But by running, she wins either way by injecting real issues, just like Ron Paul at the national level in 2008.
[00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:32.435]  As we want to play some clips from the debate and get her take on what's happening.
[00:01:32.495 --> 00:01:36.199]  But Debra Medina, we salute you and those that have been supporting you.
[00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.082]  Are you getting the same incredible feedback we're seeing here?
[00:01:40.502 --> 00:01:41.643]  We are, Alex.
[00:01:41.703 --> 00:01:46.447]  We've waited the whole day for media today and I'm back-to-back almost all day long.
[00:01:46.528 --> 00:01:49.830]  So it's been a really good push for the campaign, good bump.
[00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.532]  Lots of web traffic last night.
[00:01:52.465 --> 00:01:56.227]  Lots of contributions and clearly we've got to push hard.
[00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:57.148]  We've got to push hard.
[00:01:57.168 --> 00:02:00.970]  We've just got a few days left until the election on March 2nd.
[00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:02.871]  Absolutely.
[00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:05.552]  For those that don't know, we're going to put it up on screen as we simulcast it.
[00:02:05.913 --> 00:02:07.273]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:02:07.534 --> 00:02:08.874]  Give folks your website address.
[00:02:09.315 --> 00:02:15.958]  MedinaForTexas.com and if you go there you'll also see we've got a kind of a new text service now.
[00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:20.040]  I'm sorry, on our Facebook page we're talking about the new text service that we've got.
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.781]  You can text
[00:02:21.553 --> 00:02:22.314]  We're good to go.
[00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:40.719]  Well, this is extremely exciting what's happening.
[00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:48.185]  Perry likes to act like he's a conservative, so does Kay Bailey Hutchinson, but they've all been for the NAFTA highways.
[00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:50.546]  Hutchinson claims she isn't now.
[00:02:51.447 --> 00:02:53.028]  She's a member of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:02:53.168 --> 00:02:54.429]  Perry's been an attendee.
[00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.154]  It didn't matter how many times the legislature voted to say no to toll roads, he would always try to block it.
[00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:04.237]  I mean, you are the only choice for Texas.
[00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:13.298]  Well, I think we've talked about transportation and it really boils down to a disregard for private property ownership in Texas.
[00:03:14.118 --> 00:03:26.282]  Transportation, Texas Transportation Institute, TxDOT, are holding Texas drivers hostage to their agenda to further that supercorder through our state.
[00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:39.691]  It's time that we have somebody who will really stand up and lay the, you know, transparency, put transparency out there, audit text dot, have accountability, set the bar for excellence in state service.
[00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:43.334]  And clearly, I think people saw last night, neither Kay or Rick are going to do that.
[00:03:58.243 --> 00:03:59.123]  You know, I'm not sure.
[00:03:59.163 --> 00:04:03.105]  We had a great opportunity last night to talk with the press afterwards.
[00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:12.710]  Kay and Rick ran from that, you know, kind of reinforcing the notion that they want to talk at Texans but not listen to or engage with Texans.
[00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.393]  But I think my campaign staff was a little surprised that, and our team, a little surprised that we didn't get more questions than we did.
[00:04:19.413 --> 00:04:20.454]  I think people were
[00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:25.892]  I'm pretty shocked by the strength of the debate and the amount.
[00:04:26.953 --> 00:04:34.598]  Clearly, I'd like to talk a lot more about the issues than what we were able to, but it was more substance than I think people were expecting.
[00:04:34.878 --> 00:04:36.339]  Because all we got was bickering.
[00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:46.325]  That's what I heard the callers saying on Mainline Talk Radio was, you were substance, you were constitutional, all they did was fight with each other, and that's why you won the debate.
[00:04:46.365 --> 00:04:47.926]  Most people are saying that in Texas.
[00:04:48.186 --> 00:04:48.907]  A huge victory.
[00:04:48.927 --> 00:04:49.287]  Stay there.
[00:04:51.696 --> 00:04:56.961]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:59.723]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:04:59.763 --> 00:05:04.207]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:05:05.087 --> 00:05:09.531]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.

[00:05:25.718 --> 00:05:27.299]  This film needs to be seen.
[00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:28.479]  Everybody needs to get it.

[00:05:52.148 --> 00:05:54.749]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:55.149 --> 00:06:00.111]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:02.211]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:06:02.532 --> 00:06:07.333]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:08.494]  How much do you want?
[00:06:08.714 --> 00:06:09.454]  When do you want it?
[00:06:09.834 --> 00:06:11.435]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:06:11.715 --> 00:06:12.535]  When will you need it?
[00:06:12.795 --> 00:06:14.856]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:06:14.996 --> 00:06:16.096]  Will there be any food?
[00:06:16.336 --> 00:06:17.677]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:06:17.857 --> 00:06:18.097]  If there's
[00:06:18.097 --> 00:06:20.239]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.922]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:06:23.123 --> 00:06:26.326]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:06:26.707 --> 00:06:30.211]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:31.532]  How much will you need?
[00:06:31.773 --> 00:06:32.373]  We don't know.
[00:06:32.654 --> 00:06:33.575]  How much do you want?
[00:06:33.775 --> 00:06:34.496]  All you can get.
[00:06:34.516 --> 00:06:35.497]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:35.777 --> 00:06:38.540]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:06:38.821 --> 00:06:40.583]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:40.603 --> 00:06:41.524]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:51.482 --> 00:06:52.482]  What's your home worth?
[00:06:52.642 --> 00:06:54.583]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:06:54.763 --> 00:06:57.504]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:06:57.804 --> 00:07:05.326]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[00:07:53.403 --> 00:07:59.428]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:00.028 --> 00:08:03.011]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:04.778 --> 00:08:08.062]  Debra Medina is our guest, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:08.222 --> 00:08:10.805]  She's been in the first big Republican debate.
[00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:12.186]  Hands down, won it.
[00:08:12.246 --> 00:08:13.588]  Many newspapers are saying that.
[00:08:13.608 --> 00:08:20.075]  The grassroots that I've been monitoring is conclusively saying that they want to know more about Debra Medina.
[00:08:20.655 --> 00:08:23.719]  But the first big issue, we have an article at to infowars.com
[00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:28.744]  Governor candidate Debra Medina excluded from televised debate.
[00:08:29.184 --> 00:08:36.812]  The next key debate coming up January 29th, right before the key primary, right before voters really make their decision.
[00:08:37.512 --> 00:08:43.158]  And with your incredible showing last night, your poll numbers going up even higher, they need to put you in there.
[00:08:43.198 --> 00:08:48.503]  But I've read that Beelow, the big globalist corporation that owns a lot of the TV stations and Dallas Morning News,
[00:08:49.184 --> 00:08:56.226]  They're saying not only do you have to have 15%, you've got to be able, in the past, to have held a comparable political position.
[00:08:56.707 --> 00:08:57.867]  So you should have been a U.S.
[00:08:57.887 --> 00:09:02.008]  Senator or a Texas Governor or a Lieutenant Governor to be able to be on the same stage.
[00:09:02.508 --> 00:09:07.970]  By that yardstick, only super high-powered politicians can be in debates.
[00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.492]  I mean, they're really, as they see the revolution of awakening back to the Constitution happening,
[00:09:13.112 --> 00:09:16.396]  They are bringing out a new standard that no one can get over.
[00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:17.818]  You can't just be a mayor.
[00:09:18.158 --> 00:09:21.142]  You can't be a state representative and be in a debate now for governor.
[00:09:21.462 --> 00:09:24.246]  You have to have been a former governor or U.S.
[00:09:24.326 --> 00:09:24.706]  senator.
[00:09:26.273 --> 00:09:27.874]  This is clearly discriminatory.
[00:09:28.074 --> 00:09:30.435]  People need to boycott Velo if they don't change this.
[00:09:30.635 --> 00:09:31.855]  Dump the Dallas Morning News.
[00:09:32.215 --> 00:09:36.717]  They need to look at their past policies because they're doing a quasi-public thing.
[00:09:36.737 --> 00:09:40.618]  They're acting like it's a public debate, but really they're skewing it.
[00:09:41.139 --> 00:09:44.380]  Or people need to boycott this debate and call for other real debates.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.882]  Deborah Medina, running for governor here in Texas, give us your breakdown on this.
[00:09:50.663 --> 00:10:05.809]  Well, I think, you know, we've talked about this political royal class in America, and this is more evidence that at least the political establishment and those that support them seem to have an agenda to further that.
[00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.751]  I hope that we'll use the free market to put pressure on below.
[00:10:10.431 --> 00:10:16.254]  I know that there are supporters out there talking with their advertisers and clearly making it known to them that
[00:10:16.727 --> 00:10:18.549]  They want this debate to happen in Texas.
[00:10:18.569 --> 00:10:27.916]  They want all three candidates to be heard from, and we need another opportunity to see all three of us on stage and allow the voter to make a choice in the next election.
[00:10:28.056 --> 00:10:37.764]  So people can help us out by calling BELO and letting them know about that, but also by calling their advertisers and their customer base and letting them know.
[00:10:37.825 --> 00:10:41.367]  And then help us out by visiting MedinaForTexas.com.
[00:10:42.239 --> 00:10:50.381]  Well, Debra, I mean, looking at this, it's so outrageous to read the policy, the new policy of BELO, that you have to have 15% in the polls, and on top of it,
[00:11:02.856 --> 00:11:23.816]  You have to, and before it was 15% in the polls, in the final debate between Republicans and Democrats and third parties, and that was at the national level, and they only brought that policy in the last eight years, more restrictive than what was there previously, but to now in a primary debate say, not only do you have to have 15%, you've got to hold comparable
[00:11:25.758 --> 00:11:53.556]  Public status so you would have had to be a governor from another state or a US senator to be able to be on that stage that is an impossible hurdle that on its face is fraud I mean this is they must be scared to death of the grassroots and now they might just come right out and ban third parties or ban candidates from higher office if you weren't already in higher office I mean how will people get into higher office if you have to first be in the highest level of executive office I mean this isn't
[00:11:53.956 --> 00:11:54.837]  This is outrageous!
[00:11:54.937 --> 00:11:57.959]  Well, and it's just totally ignoring even the candidacy.
[00:11:57.979 --> 00:12:03.904]  You know, the rest of the media all over Texas, and certainly the grassroots, is abuzz with what happened in that debate last night.
[00:12:04.284 --> 00:12:13.571]  And yet, when you read the Dallas Morning News and their report of the debate, they kind of leave Debra Medina out, almost as though I wasn't on stage.
[00:12:13.651 --> 00:12:17.574]  It's like, were you even at the same debate the rest of Texas was watching?
[00:12:17.614 --> 00:12:21.157]  Because to read their report, they don't
[00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:28.571]  They don't address the Debra Medina factor at all, and I guess clearly that's where the establishment would like to see.
[00:12:28.611 --> 00:12:30.772]  They don't want people rising up.
[00:12:30.812 --> 00:12:45.515]  They want us to be worker bees serving that political class, but not out here producing on our own and being independent and enjoying the liberty that our founders put into that Constitution.
[00:12:46.417 --> 00:12:53.701]  They set this nation up so that we can enjoy that freedom and prosperity that's God-given life, liberty, property.
[00:12:53.721 --> 00:12:55.242]  That's not yours to give.
[00:12:55.302 --> 00:12:57.664]  It was given to us by the Creator.
[00:12:57.784 --> 00:13:10.011]  It's yours to protect and preserve, and the Constitution gives us the way, gives us the blueprint by which to do that, and yet we've got just exactly what our Founders knew we were going to have, this abuse,
[00:13:13.828 --> 00:13:26.174]  Well, Perry's one talking point was that you and Kay Bailey Hutchinson hate Texas and are saying Texas is bad when you're trying to save what Texas is.
[00:13:26.494 --> 00:13:33.637]  It's Perry that masquerades as a conservative, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson is even worse, if that's possible, from Washington.
[00:13:34.617 --> 00:13:42.342]  And they have brought in, conservatively, a $400 million looting deal to grab 8,000 miles of existing roads and put toll roads on them.
[00:13:42.542 --> 00:13:46.105]  They're both involved, up to their eyeballs in it, though they now try to deny that.
[00:13:46.185 --> 00:13:47.225]  It's on record they are.
[00:13:48.046 --> 00:13:48.446]  They are.
[00:13:49.187 --> 00:13:52.169]  Texas has passed all these new districts for taxing.
[00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:58.012]  Every few months, a new bureaucrat shows up and tells me about some new tax that my little office has to pay.
[00:13:58.953 --> 00:14:03.236]  We are turning into California or New York or Illinois or something.
[00:14:03.556 --> 00:14:07.921]  Texas does have people flooding to it, because it's not as bad as other states, but not for long.
[00:14:08.622 --> 00:14:22.778]  I mean, you're trying to save Texas as a haven of low taxes and low regulation, and we know what K-Baby and Mr. Hairspray, Pretty Hair, Twinkle Toes, Perry is going to do, and for him to try to spin it,
[00:14:23.819 --> 00:14:25.980]  That you're bad-mouthing Texas.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.562]  It's just more fraud from this guy.
[00:14:28.822 --> 00:14:31.143]  The sales taxes keep going up.
[00:14:31.263 --> 00:14:35.205]  The property taxes keep going up, even as housing prices go down.
[00:14:35.766 --> 00:14:38.527]  Can you speak to what you would do as governor to the tax system?
[00:14:39.107 --> 00:14:41.188]  Well, we've got to eliminate property tax.
[00:14:42.309 --> 00:14:42.929]  Eliminate!
[00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.291]  We didn't have it before and built this country.
[00:14:45.411 --> 00:14:46.331]  Eliminate it!
[00:14:46.611 --> 00:14:48.272]  It's a tax on your property.
[00:14:48.332 --> 00:14:48.832]  It's rent.
[00:14:49.072 --> 00:14:51.694]  You don't really own your property, the founders said, if you have a property tax.
[00:14:52.244 --> 00:14:53.665]  We've got to eliminate property tax.
[00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:57.367]  We've got to recognize that we do need some essential government services.
[00:14:57.407 --> 00:15:02.690]  There are some things that cities and counties and the state government need to do, and clearly they need funds for that.
[00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:11.614]  But the best way to raise that money, the taxing method that causes the least drag on a free and prosperous economy is a sales tax.
[00:15:11.654 --> 00:15:12.895]  We need to broaden the base.
[00:15:13.507 --> 00:15:13.847]  I think so.
[00:15:36.311 --> 00:15:41.095]  We've got to do that, but I think that the Governor, you know, he'd like to paint this really rosy picture.
[00:15:41.155 --> 00:15:50.743]  I guess as a registered nurse, my job wasn't to look at how healthy I would like for you to be, but to deal with the reality of what your clinical conditions and signs are.
[00:15:51.163 --> 00:15:55.967]  And the reality of the economic condition here in Texas isn't near as rosy as he'd like to paint it.
[00:15:56.497 --> 00:15:58.639]  I certainly am not about tearing Texas down.
[00:15:58.699 --> 00:16:09.548]  I'm about being a realist and looking at, objectively, where we are, figuring out what's hindering us, and getting us on the path to that freedom and prosperity that we ought to be enjoying.
[00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:16.734]  When you are having jobs in the public sector and boasting about employment numbers going up,
[00:16:17.679 --> 00:16:19.701]  That is a bold-faced lie.
[00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:22.883]  You are creating more of a burden on the private sector.
[00:16:22.903 --> 00:16:28.708]  We've added 156,000 jobs in the public sector in the last four years.
[00:16:29.168 --> 00:16:36.974]  He's boasting about adding 142,000 to the Texas economy in the last four years, but all of those have been in the public sector.
[00:16:37.014 --> 00:16:39.896]  We've lost 14,000 jobs in the private sector.
[00:16:39.936 --> 00:16:41.057]  That's not job growth.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.240]  Absolutely.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:50.945]  So for those that don't understand, Texas is becoming like Massachusetts or New York, and Perry's saying in his doublespeak, that's a great thing.
[00:16:51.505 --> 00:16:55.087]  Debra Medina's saying, no, go back the way Texas was.
[00:16:55.187 --> 00:16:57.249]  Make Texas great again.
[00:16:58.129 --> 00:17:00.190]  They're trying to raise the Texas gas tax.
[00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.532]  They're trying to do everything right now.
[00:17:03.092 --> 00:17:04.813]  We have got to block this.
[00:17:04.893 --> 00:17:07.114]  I mean, the economy is imploding in this state.
[00:17:07.515 --> 00:17:13.378]  Not as bad as other states, because we haven't had the blight of big government as much as other states.
[00:17:13.738 --> 00:17:19.062]  That's why people are running to Texas right now, running away from big government.
[00:17:19.102 --> 00:17:20.422]  Debra, I want to play a clip of you
[00:17:21.784 --> 00:17:22.644]  Alex, let me jump in.
[00:17:22.745 --> 00:17:25.948]  Not as bad as other states, because they overtaxed us a few years ago.
[00:17:26.028 --> 00:17:31.554]  Remember, he built up that rainy day fund to $20 billion because he was overtaxing Texans.
[00:17:32.375 --> 00:17:35.939]  Anybody that's sitting on that kind of profit can weather a storm.
[00:17:35.979 --> 00:17:43.167]  That's why Texas is weathering the storm, because the governor and the legislature allowed those taxes to be overcollected in prior years.
[00:17:45.425 --> 00:17:47.727]  Absolutely, and most of them have their hands in the till.
[00:17:47.787 --> 00:17:51.609]  Now, I want to play a clip of you confronting Perry during the debate.
[00:17:51.649 --> 00:17:59.374]  Again, you were always bringing up issues, they were bringing up lots of feel-good propaganda, and having a catfight between themselves, the two ninnies.
[00:17:59.634 --> 00:18:00.135]  Here it is.
[00:18:02.736 --> 00:18:07.720]  You were a Democrat before you were a Republican, having worked for Al Gore as his campaign manager.
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.102]  You've broken promises on education,
[00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.173]  Securing our border and property tax reform.
[00:18:15.953 --> 00:18:20.077]  You failed to listen to Texans on issues like the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:26.023]  What evidence can you give we Texans that you'll keep your word this time around?
[00:18:27.455 --> 00:18:27.595]  Ms.
[00:18:27.615 --> 00:18:36.117]  Medina, I made the same decision that Ronald Reagan made back in his life, that the Republican Party was the party that I wanted to be associated with.
[00:18:36.737 --> 00:18:39.177]  And I'm glad I did, and I'm glad he did.
[00:18:39.617 --> 00:18:43.198]  And I'm glad to be a part of the party that Ronald Reagan came to.
[00:18:43.858 --> 00:18:51.660]  From the standpoint of putting our promises in place, I promised that I would do everything that I could to make this state a place where people were proud to live.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.201]  And I think we've done that.
[00:18:53.542 --> 00:19:12.499]  When you look at what we have created in this state over the last eight years, when you look at walking into a budget deficit of $10 billion in 2003, cutting that budget, reducing the taxes, the tort reform that we passed, I will tell you that doctors all across this state are really proud of what we've been able to do.
[00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:13.300]  Thank you, Governor.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.404]  People are proud to live in Texas and live in a state where they can keep more of what they work for.
[00:19:17.987 --> 00:19:18.748]  Can I respond?
[00:19:19.249 --> 00:19:20.450]  Very briefly, please.
[00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:33.987]  You know, you talk about the great economic state that we're in, but the reality is Texas' own consolidated annual financial report shows under your leadership our debts tripled, and per capita taxation has gone up 49%.
[00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:39.797]  That's painting a rosy picture that doesn't exist.
[00:19:39.937 --> 00:19:45.958]  Texans are suffering because Texas is marching right down the same path that California did.
[00:19:45.998 --> 00:19:49.559]  If we don't change our course, we're going to find ourselves there.
[00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:49.999]  Thank you.
[00:19:50.019 --> 00:19:50.059]  Ms.
[00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:50.299]  Medina.
[00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:51.319]  Unbelievably good.
[00:19:52.159 --> 00:19:57.360]  Again, she had actual government numbers, something that these politicians never give the public.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.801]  She was giving you the real numbers.
[00:19:59.861 --> 00:20:01.021]  Incredible, Debra Medina.
[00:20:01.041 --> 00:20:03.162]  That's why you need to be the next governor.
[00:20:03.262 --> 00:20:04.642]  I think you and I read the Texas...
[00:20:05.396 --> 00:20:07.257]  Consolidated Annual Financial Report.
[00:20:07.297 --> 00:20:09.758]  I'm not sure either Kay or Rick have ever looked at that.
[00:20:09.778 --> 00:20:16.040]  You can't be an executive and not know what the financial condition of your organization is.
[00:20:16.261 --> 00:20:17.241]  Texans deserve
[00:20:17.708 --> 00:20:24.491]  An accurate, honest, annual financial report from our CEO, that's the governor, and he's failed to do that time and time again.
[00:20:24.751 --> 00:20:32.734]  And he got upset when you brought that up because no one, ten years ago when I first started exposing this with Walter Burien and made a film about it, no one knew about these.
[00:20:33.034 --> 00:20:35.796]  That's the real set of books, not the budget.
[00:20:35.836 --> 00:20:38.137]  The budget is the fake thing they push.
[00:20:38.417 --> 00:20:40.538]  And boy, you broke a big taboo.
[00:20:40.818 --> 00:20:43.759]  He got upset when you mentioned that little secret name.
[00:20:44.707 --> 00:20:45.868]  Well, I'm going to keep doing that.
[00:20:45.928 --> 00:20:51.732]  In fact, I carry it with me most everywhere I go, and if they'd let me have some notes on stage last night, I'd have it in my hand.
[00:20:52.833 --> 00:20:55.154]  It is dog-eared and being used up.
[00:20:55.234 --> 00:21:03.360]  I'm waiting for the newest one to come out so that we can kind of look at where we are, but certainly we've seen the assets of Texas dwindle.
[00:21:04.061 --> 00:21:08.604]  They have not been well-managed, and we're going to keep reporting that to people.
[00:21:08.624 --> 00:21:09.564]  I think we all know it.
[00:21:09.625 --> 00:21:12.106]  Intuitively, we know something's not right here.
[00:21:12.166 --> 00:21:14.428]  Things are not economically as healthy as
[00:21:14.966 --> 00:21:19.047]  The governor paints, you know, the picture that he paints.
[00:21:19.528 --> 00:21:21.368]  We also ought to be pushing Texas.
[00:21:21.388 --> 00:21:29.791]  I've been pushing Texas to call a special session and nullify health care, but we also ought to be pushing the state government to cut spending right now.
[00:21:29.811 --> 00:21:33.572]  We've seen tremendous declines in the sales tax revenues.
[00:21:33.933 --> 00:21:37.554]  The amount of money that they predicted they would have to spend is not going to come in.
[00:21:37.574 --> 00:21:40.115]  We already know we're going to be facing a huge hole in 2011.
[00:21:41.621 --> 00:21:45.922]  Debra, shifting gears in the time we have left, we're going to get you in studio for a full hour in the near future.
[00:21:45.962 --> 00:21:48.163]  You're gracious enough to spend that time with us.
[00:22:13.709 --> 00:22:31.206]  If you could become governor, and it will then be a beacon to other states, Texas leads the nation, California leads the nation in collapse, Texas leads the nation in revival, historically, financially, as Texas goes, the rest of the nation goes, that's been said for over 60 years.
[00:22:32.921 --> 00:22:44.672]  That if you can win in Texas, then in other gubernatorial races coming up, other in-the-fetters, true patriots, true libertarians, true constitutionalists will have even bigger shots.
[00:22:44.732 --> 00:22:50.237]  That's why this race is so important to the rest of the country, because it's a bellwether.
[00:22:50.497 --> 00:22:56.403]  And just briefly, if you became governor, you're saying, and other attorney generals are already saying this in other states,
[00:22:57.023 --> 00:22:59.085]  Block the government takeover of health care.
[00:22:59.545 --> 00:23:01.086]  Block the NAFTA takeover.
[00:23:02.287 --> 00:23:03.448]  Really secure our border.
[00:23:03.929 --> 00:23:06.651]  I mean, governors have such incredible constitutional power.
[00:23:06.951 --> 00:23:15.478]  Briefly, what will you do through Texas on the national stage to block the globalist takeover if you become governor?
[00:23:18.364 --> 00:23:24.625]  Starting now, talking to people about legislators, about getting us the legislation we need to secure private property ownership.
[00:23:24.665 --> 00:23:27.606]  But at the federal level, boy, we've got to stop health care.
[00:23:27.666 --> 00:23:32.787]  Not one bit of that new nationalization of federal health care ought to be coming into Texas.
[00:23:33.227 --> 00:23:36.668]  I think we're going to see cap-and-trade come at us through the EPA.
[00:23:36.728 --> 00:23:42.629]  I don't know that they're actually going to get the bill through the Congress, but the EPA is going to try to implement that anyway.
[00:23:42.769 --> 00:23:44.630]  It kills industry.
[00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.390]  It kills all industry in Texas.
[00:23:46.866 --> 00:23:51.472]  We have got to get the Attorney General fighting on the behalf of Texas against the EPA.
[00:23:51.532 --> 00:23:54.235]  The Governor ought to be interposing against the EPA.
[00:23:54.696 --> 00:23:58.060]  We have a Texas, the TCEQ here in Texas that's not
[00:23:58.536 --> 00:24:00.639]  Maybe doing what it should and all that it should.
[00:24:00.679 --> 00:24:02.461]  It's kind of been the puppet of the EPA.
[00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:12.833]  We need to re-look at the role of that agency and say, you know, Texas is going to take a critical look at where and if we need to be regulating industry and everywhere else we're going to get out.
[00:24:12.853 --> 00:24:16.978]  We're not going to allow the EPA to set the tune that we dance to here.
[00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:23.513]  Push them out of that and let energy, ag, and other industry here in Texas produce like it needs to.
[00:24:23.593 --> 00:24:35.429]  That's going to send a real message all over the country and kind of restore to America that manufacturing base that we once had and allow people to get back to that healthy, prosperous economy.
[00:24:37.113 --> 00:24:43.715]  Well, you're an intelligent lady, you're a constitutionalist, people are really resonating with your message.
[00:24:43.815 --> 00:24:55.338]  And I just want to say again, regardless if you win or not, we all win because you've now injected real issues, and we're now growing the grassroots across the country, just like with what happened with Ron Paul.
[00:24:56.118 --> 00:25:04.821]  It is essential, though, that people support you, that they put your yard signs up, that they call local radio, that they call BELO and say, put you in the next debate.
[00:25:05.521 --> 00:25:11.845]  That they donate on your website or sign up at your Facebook or get your email and text message alerts.
[00:25:12.546 --> 00:25:13.406]  It is essential.
[00:25:13.967 --> 00:25:18.129]  And it's just the political will of getting involved will lead us to victory.
[00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:26.735]  We know the path of standing up for freedom will win if people just keep going, keep coming, and never back off and never stop.
[00:25:28.556 --> 00:25:34.901]  In the last 3-4 minutes we've got left, Debra Medina, other issues, other points you'd like to make to this worldwide audience?
[00:25:35.161 --> 00:25:37.743]  Well, I think I've got to pick up with where you're going.
[00:25:37.783 --> 00:25:39.144]  You're absolutely right, Alex.
[00:25:39.184 --> 00:25:40.585]  This is pedal to the metal.
[00:25:40.625 --> 00:25:43.828]  The only poll that counts is March 2nd.
[00:25:43.868 --> 00:25:45.569]  That is Texas Independence Day.
[00:25:45.889 --> 00:25:47.951]  The dominoes are falling our way.
[00:25:48.071 --> 00:25:54.456]  If you ever thought that there was a time when your vote counted, it is now.
[00:25:54.596 --> 00:25:55.597]  You've got to get out.
[00:25:55.637 --> 00:25:57.038]  You've got to do all you can.
[00:25:57.637 --> 00:26:05.785]  To raise the identity of this campaign, to help people know that there is someone carrying the voice of the people.
[00:26:05.905 --> 00:26:07.928]  I am just that vessel carrying that message.
[00:26:08.468 --> 00:26:10.050]  I'm honored to do it for Texas.
[00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.233]  I'm going to fight really hard, but we have got to have your help.
[00:26:13.715 --> 00:26:15.416]  We can win this race.
[00:26:15.476 --> 00:26:16.217]  Don't let up.
[00:26:16.297 --> 00:26:17.137]  Don't back off.
[00:26:17.437 --> 00:26:18.978]  This is a sprint to the finish.
[00:26:19.018 --> 00:26:23.061]  We're going to push really hard through until 7.01 p.m.
[00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:26.002]  on March 2nd and not let up a second before then.
[00:26:26.703 --> 00:26:28.544]  MedinaForTexas.com.
[00:26:28.924 --> 00:26:29.865]  Help us that way.
[00:26:29.945 --> 00:26:30.325]  Get out.
[00:26:30.385 --> 00:26:31.106]  Knock on doors.
[00:26:31.186 --> 00:26:32.186]  Let your neighbors know.
[00:26:32.426 --> 00:26:33.247]  Ask them to vote.
[00:26:33.307 --> 00:26:36.149]  And then make sure that they go vote.
[00:26:36.629 --> 00:26:38.770]  So many people say, oh yeah, I'm all about that.
[00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:40.771]  And then they get busy and they don't vote.
[00:26:41.252 --> 00:26:43.253]  Early voting starts in February.
[00:26:43.797 --> 00:26:44.077]  I don't know.
[00:27:03.311 --> 00:27:08.796]  You know, kind of trying to marginalize the campaign and again say we're not going to have an impact on this race.
[00:27:08.836 --> 00:27:11.198]  Boy, we're going to have an impact and we saw that last night.
[00:27:11.218 --> 00:27:21.567]  There was a period, and I know, you know, we've got a lot of problems with Google, but there was a period last night that we were the number one search on Google and for several hours we were the number three search on Google.
[00:27:21.987 --> 00:27:25.570]  It went through not just Texas but the country like a firestorm.
[00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:30.835]  We can win this, but it means all of us have got to dig in until March 2nd and work hard.
[00:27:31.874 --> 00:27:35.055]  The people know we're being looted and being robbed.
[00:27:35.075 --> 00:27:38.477]  30 plus states are moving to declare sovereignty.
[00:27:38.497 --> 00:27:40.437]  The media spins that and says it's secession.
[00:27:40.497 --> 00:27:40.698]  No.
[00:27:41.118 --> 00:27:42.538]  The states created the federal government.
[00:27:42.558 --> 00:27:43.339]  They're saying no.
[00:27:43.839 --> 00:27:45.820]  The federal government's controlled by offshore banks.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.320]  That's now public.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.101]  Geithner's on the verge of being indicted.
[00:27:50.421 --> 00:27:51.082]  We now have
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:28:04.774]  This individual at the White House, Harvard professor Cass Sunstein, is now the head of federal regulation saying that he wants to ban free speech and the Second Amendment.
[00:28:04.954 --> 00:28:07.217]  I mean, he's actually saying it.
[00:28:08.198 --> 00:28:13.743]  On video, on television, and that he's the next guy set to be the next Supreme Court Justice.
[00:28:14.203 --> 00:28:15.684]  I mean, this country's in deep trouble.
[00:28:15.704 --> 00:28:17.045]  These people aren't playing games.
[00:28:17.085 --> 00:28:19.627]  You know, it's what caused the battle at the Alamo.
[00:28:19.968 --> 00:28:23.591]  You know, they're essentially declaring the Constitution null and void.
[00:28:23.671 --> 00:28:26.273]  We've got a rule of law here, we're just going to ignore it.
[00:28:26.727 --> 00:28:28.628]  We ignore it, we ignore it, we ignore it.
[00:28:28.668 --> 00:28:32.571]  That's when Travis drew a line in the sand and said, you know, we're not ignoring this.
[00:28:32.611 --> 00:28:37.414]  You're not going to toss out the Constitution and name yourself dictator.
[00:28:37.454 --> 00:28:38.595]  That's what's happening here.
[00:28:38.695 --> 00:28:39.735]  People see it.
[00:28:40.216 --> 00:28:48.361]  We will either fight today at the ballot box or our children will shed blood to regain the freedoms that we've lost.
[00:28:48.441 --> 00:28:49.241]  I think we know that.
[00:28:49.301 --> 00:28:50.662]  I think all of Texas knows that.
[00:28:51.022 --> 00:28:52.363]  Now's the time to dig in.
[00:28:52.443 --> 00:28:53.224]  Fight for us.
[00:28:53.484 --> 00:28:53.724]  Let's go.
[00:28:55.145 --> 00:28:55.285]  I don't
[00:29:12.714 --> 00:29:15.976]  You're, you know, cut out of Ron Paul cloth, and that you're the real deal.
[00:29:16.256 --> 00:29:17.517]  We need to make you governor.
[00:29:17.777 --> 00:29:24.301]  And we need to certainly try as hard as we can, because regardless, we win in the info war by doing it.
[00:29:24.622 --> 00:29:28.284]  I talk about my neighbors, a bunch of yuppies who don't usually care about what's happening.
[00:29:28.544 --> 00:29:30.946]  I talk to them now, they're all waking up and freaking out.
[00:29:31.226 --> 00:29:34.788]  Deborah Medina, we salute you, and we thank you for your great work.
[00:29:34.828 --> 00:29:36.129]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[00:29:36.449 --> 00:29:40.592]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the White House czar saying he wants your guns.
[00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:45.151]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:46.091 --> 00:29:48.852]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:51.132 --> 00:29:57.994]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:29:58.134 --> 00:30:00.074]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:30:00.214 --> 00:30:02.335]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:30:02.455 --> 00:30:03.955]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:30:04.095 --> 00:30:08.396]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:30:50.825 --> 00:30:55.068]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:55.369 --> 00:30:55.989]  Number one.
[00:30:56.289 --> 00:30:59.452]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:59.712 --> 00:31:00.293]  Number two.
[00:31:00.573 --> 00:31:05.136]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:05.477 --> 00:31:05.917]  It's true.
[00:31:06.217 --> 00:31:10.761]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:11.081 --> 00:31:11.622]  Number 3.
[00:31:11.902 --> 00:31:15.185]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:15.486 --> 00:31:19.230]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:19.950]  Number 4.
[00:31:20.191 --> 00:31:22.573]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:22.974 --> 00:31:26.357]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:26.637 --> 00:31:26.858]  Number 5.
[00:31:27.418 --> 00:31:31.341]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:31.562 --> 00:31:36.346]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:36.626 --> 00:31:40.649]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:42.371]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:42.591 --> 00:31:44.673]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:31:51.274 --> 00:31:53.876]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:54.277 --> 00:31:59.241]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:01.363]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:01.663 --> 00:32:06.488]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:06.668 --> 00:32:07.629]  How much do you want?
[00:32:07.849 --> 00:32:08.590]  When do you want it?
[00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:10.571]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:10.852 --> 00:32:11.692]  When will you need it?
[00:32:11.933 --> 00:32:13.994]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:14.134 --> 00:32:15.235]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:15.476 --> 00:32:16.777]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:16.997 --> 00:32:22.061]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:22.241 --> 00:32:25.463]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:25.843 --> 00:32:29.346]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:29.646 --> 00:32:30.647]  How much will you need?
[00:32:30.887 --> 00:32:31.508]  We don't know.
[00:32:31.788 --> 00:32:32.708]  How much do you want?
[00:32:32.889 --> 00:32:33.609]  All you can get.
[00:32:33.629 --> 00:32:34.630]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:37.672]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:37.952 --> 00:32:39.714]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:39.734 --> 00:32:40.795]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:40.815 --> 00:32:41.535]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:33:06.303 --> 00:33:08.504]  It is Friday, the 15th day of January 2010.
[00:33:11.264 --> 00:33:20.186]  I am now going to cover one of the most important issues we have ever discussed on this radio broadcast.
[00:33:26.528 --> 00:33:30.049]  When I say that over 90% of the time when I cover an issue,
[00:33:31.337 --> 00:33:33.405]  It turns out it's worse than I thought.
[00:33:33.485 --> 00:33:36.335]  It's worse than we have said previously.
[00:33:37.287 --> 00:33:40.688]  And that is certainly the case with Barack Obama and his czars.
[00:33:41.429 --> 00:33:52.013]  As bad as Bush was, New World Order, staged terror attacks, fake wars, fake WMDs, Patriot Act, Obama has continued and expanded all of it.
[00:33:52.513 --> 00:33:58.375]  And now the Village Voice and Raw Story and all the big liberal publications are admitting he's a monster.
[00:33:58.775 --> 00:34:01.136]  But he's a monster because that's his job.
[00:34:01.476 --> 00:34:03.237]  Four times the Wall Street money.
[00:34:04.775 --> 00:34:05.956]  That John McCain got.
[00:34:06.196 --> 00:34:07.777]  Not that John McCain would have been good.
[00:34:08.218 --> 00:34:10.039]  Obama was the heir apparent.
[00:34:10.279 --> 00:34:11.780]  He was the corporate choice.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.841]  The globalist choice.
[00:34:13.962 --> 00:34:15.343]  McCain would have been just as bad.
[00:34:16.484 --> 00:34:17.825]  But Obama was vetted.
[00:34:17.905 --> 00:34:18.786]  He was chosen.
[00:34:19.546 --> 00:34:27.072]  He engages in so many frauds that we cover in the Obama deception that we cover in my other film from last year, Fall of the Republic.
[00:34:29.468 --> 00:34:31.229]  I mean, he lied about not hiring lobbyists.
[00:34:31.289 --> 00:34:32.250]  All he hired was lobbyists.
[00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:38.614]  He lied about saying he wouldn't do signing statements that are unconstitutional, where he just writes the laws however he wants after Congress passes them.
[00:34:39.054 --> 00:34:40.115]  He swore he wouldn't do that.
[00:34:40.155 --> 00:34:41.636]  He swore he'd have the most open government.
[00:34:41.836 --> 00:34:44.278]  He swore he'd end the war in Iraq immediately.
[00:34:44.318 --> 00:34:46.519]  Then it was 16 months and 20 months and 5 years.
[00:34:46.839 --> 00:34:48.280]  He's increasing all these other wars.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.502]  He's expanding torture, secret arrest.
[00:34:51.584 --> 00:34:58.426]  He does little things like go, I'm fighting against these bailouts of the banks when his people all passed them.
[00:34:59.086 --> 00:35:02.608]  His people were in the private sector and government running it with Bush.
[00:35:02.928 --> 00:35:04.368]  They handed the baton off to him.
[00:35:04.768 --> 00:35:14.111]  Then he says, I've signed an executive order stopping executive pay and stopping bonuses to AIG, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citibank and others.
[00:35:14.772 --> 00:35:18.213]  And then if you read the executive order, it said they can have unlimited.
[00:35:19.449 --> 00:35:28.477]  And the regulators from Goldman Sachs that run the government regulation at the SEC, they get to shut down bonuses to small banks and credit unions.
[00:35:28.777 --> 00:35:33.662]  And they get to come in with regulators and take over banks like Wahoo that were healthy.
[00:35:35.523 --> 00:35:42.289]  They have a license to steal other banks, insurance companies, to take over whatever they want, and his new tax on banks.
[00:35:42.449 --> 00:35:43.950]  I've read his proposal.
[00:35:44.451 --> 00:35:50.496]  It's a selective tax that his regulators, all JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs former employees, that's all they are.
[00:35:51.997 --> 00:35:54.800]  They pass bailout money and give it to themselves under Bush.
[00:35:55.501 --> 00:35:58.043]  They continue it under Obama and give it to themselves.
[00:35:58.964 --> 00:36:02.387]  I mean, it's just unbelievable magnitude of fraud.
[00:36:03.567 --> 00:36:09.809]  And yeah, you thought Bush was bad, tripling the size of government in eight years, in less than one year in office.
[00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:12.450]  He hasn't even been in office a year.
[00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:15.571]  Eight months in is when we passed the Rubicon.
[00:36:16.191 --> 00:36:17.111]  More money.
[00:36:17.371 --> 00:36:19.112]  We're now 11 and a half months in.
[00:36:21.372 --> 00:36:30.675]  Within eight months of being in office, he had spent more money than all presidents from George W. Bush to George Washington before him, and that's an official number.
[00:36:31.957 --> 00:36:46.084]  Twelve trillion dollars, with interest on top of it, that's not even calculated, without interest, more than all presidents before him combined, and he said he was going to balance the budget and cut spending.
[00:36:47.125 --> 00:36:49.566]  And he's still saying I'm cutting spending and balancing the budget.
[00:36:49.906 --> 00:36:55.309]  That's like hacking someone's arms and legs off with a hatchet and telling them you're going to help them not bleed to death.
[00:36:57.045 --> 00:37:03.310]  Now he's hacked the arms and legs off, he just chopped the head off, and the final blood's spraying out, and he's saying, I'm helping you!
[00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:12.836]  I mean, it is just unbelievable the level of brazen chutzpah, or whatever, arrogance, aplomb, in-your-face
[00:37:15.336 --> 00:37:19.117]  Hubris, imperial, insane, megalomania.
[00:37:19.917 --> 00:37:21.718]  But remember, he's just a front man.
[00:37:22.118 --> 00:37:24.379]  A Harvard lawyer reading off a teleprompter.
[00:37:24.879 --> 00:37:27.639]  It's the banks and the offshore corporations that are doing this.
[00:37:27.719 --> 00:37:40.463]  Now, I didn't drop the ball, but I just want to point out for new listeners, if you think we're exaggerating, it's almost always worse than I think.
[00:37:43.974 --> 00:37:51.300]  Every czar I look at, because I've only looked at a few in depth, last night I started randomly looking at all his other czars.
[00:37:51.881 --> 00:38:00.027]  Every one of them has declared themselves in books they've written or white papers in recent times that they are Marxist, Leninist, Maoist.
[00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:05.352]  I mean that, folks, Mao killed 60 plus million people.
[00:38:09.525 --> 00:38:12.492]  I mean, they openly say they're communists.
[00:38:12.593 --> 00:38:13.655]  Every stinkin' one of them!
[00:38:15.971 --> 00:38:16.752]  Every one of them.
[00:38:16.792 --> 00:38:18.073]  His diversity czar.
[00:38:19.414 --> 00:38:22.056]  His Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs czar.
[00:38:22.476 --> 00:38:23.917]  His community organizing czars.
[00:38:24.417 --> 00:38:25.958]  I spent hour after hour last night.
[00:38:26.018 --> 00:38:26.719]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:38:26.739 --> 00:38:27.780]  It was worse than I even thought.
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.462]  Every one of them saying there's no Second Amendment.
[00:38:30.482 --> 00:38:31.903]  They will completely take your guns.
[00:38:32.323 --> 00:38:34.405]  Every one of them saying they want to ban free speech.
[00:38:34.765 --> 00:38:40.349]  Clip after clip of them saying, we want to do what Hugo Chavez has done and ban all media we don't agree with.
[00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:42.951]  We've got those clips.
[00:38:45.973 --> 00:38:57.178]  In fact, just for everybody right now watching on PrisonPlanet.TV, Google White House Czar says he wants Hugo Chavez-style censorship.
[00:38:58.879 --> 00:39:01.720]  And you'll see multiple, it's a talking point, you'll see multiple ones doing it.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.401]  The Diversity Czar and others.
[00:39:06.022 --> 00:39:08.543]  Go and Google, and you'll see video of them!
[00:39:08.563 --> 00:39:10.064]  This is not our opinion.
[00:39:11.442 --> 00:39:12.723]  This is not just their writings.
[00:39:12.783 --> 00:39:14.944]  People don't seem to take their own books serious.
[00:39:15.604 --> 00:39:16.285]  Written by them!
[00:39:18.086 --> 00:39:24.950]  If you Google the term, White House czar says 2nd Amendment needs to be overturned, you will get countless links.
[00:39:29.872 --> 00:39:32.494]  Look, you get Sunstein, you get them all when you put that term in.
[00:39:32.514 --> 00:39:34.095]  Yeah, it's the diversity czar one.
[00:39:34.715 --> 00:39:35.095]  Lloyd.
[00:39:35.115 --> 00:39:35.856]  It's right there.
[00:39:36.276 --> 00:39:39.378]  Obama's diversity czar, Lloyd, and Marxist.
[00:39:40.677 --> 00:39:57.854]  And then it goes into him and there's video, scroll down, there'll be video of him saying in a speech, the video's gone dead, you need to go find it on YouTube, the point is, the point is there's so much of this, there's so many mountains of this where they're saying,
[00:40:00.859 --> 00:40:06.041]  And they don't just say, we're going to restrict some free speech with a fairness doctrine or censoring the web.
[00:40:06.081 --> 00:40:09.162]  They say, we're going to outlaw criticizing government.
[00:40:09.502 --> 00:40:19.146]  They say, we're going to infiltrate your groups and call for violence, posing as your groups, any grassroots organization, anti-war, pro-gun, it's everybody's listed by them.
[00:40:21.327 --> 00:40:26.529]  And we're going to come into your groups and we're going to try to get those that don't leave to commit crimes so we can jail you.
[00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:32.251]  That's what one of the most powerful czars, Cass Sunstein, says.
[00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:33.431]  And we've got his quotes.
[00:40:34.612 --> 00:40:39.414]  We've got his white paper he wrote a year and a half ago and released.
[00:40:39.454 --> 00:40:41.535]  This is one of Obama's chief mentors.
[00:40:42.415 --> 00:40:48.637]  And we need to really let it sink in that these really are outrageous criminals that hate our freedom.
[00:40:49.318 --> 00:40:56.401]  Zoom in right here on this document, this article, from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:41:01.013 --> 00:41:07.275]  Obama information czar planned for government to infiltrate conspiracy groups.
[00:41:08.895 --> 00:41:14.237]  Sunstein called for COINTELPRO style effort to silence truth army of hired provocateurs.
[00:41:14.257 --> 00:41:19.639]  But the main article I want printed, and I've asked Steve Watson to add the videos I sent him this morning.
[00:41:19.739 --> 00:41:20.899]  I want people to see it.
[00:41:21.299 --> 00:41:23.240]  Not just links to it, or not just quotes.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.941]  Or ask Kurt Nemo to add it and we'll post it on InfoWars.
[00:41:27.541 --> 00:41:29.862]  One of the most important articles we've ever posted.
[00:41:32.416 --> 00:41:36.941]  Good, he's added the videos.
[00:41:52.282 --> 00:41:53.803]  Literally, folks, I'm in a war room.
[00:41:54.163 --> 00:41:58.545]  It's the equivalent of somebody in a foxhole at the Alamo and enemy soldiers are just climbing over us.
[00:41:58.565 --> 00:42:00.146]  I mean, I'm just like, fire at that one!
[00:42:00.366 --> 00:42:01.447]  Intensify fire there!
[00:42:01.627 --> 00:42:02.147]  Look at this!
[00:42:02.307 --> 00:42:02.728]  Look at that!
[00:42:02.788 --> 00:42:07.470]  I mean, it is just mountains of them out in the open going, we're gonna arrest you.
[00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:08.971]  We're gonna ban your speech.
[00:42:09.211 --> 00:42:10.312]  We're gonna ban hunting.
[00:42:10.332 --> 00:42:12.333]  We're gonna ban the Second Amendment outright.
[00:42:12.593 --> 00:42:13.954]  We're gonna take your guns.
[00:42:14.334 --> 00:42:16.095]  We're gonna arrest you.
[00:42:16.295 --> 00:42:17.716]  I mean, it is un...
[00:42:18.436 --> 00:42:19.076]  Unbelievable.
[00:42:19.156 --> 00:42:20.837]  And then scroll down for people on that article.
[00:42:21.197 --> 00:42:28.480]  Obama's favorite for Supreme Court Justice Sunstein wants to ban guns-free speech.
[00:42:29.281 --> 00:42:32.282]  Regulatory czar has already been tapped for senior position.
[00:42:33.496 --> 00:42:43.342]  And you scroll down, you can see the YouTube videos of him at Harvard and other universities openly hour after hour after hour.
[00:42:44.002 --> 00:42:49.005]  I got up at 6.30 this morning, went back downstairs on the computer and just kept watching him.
[00:42:50.506 --> 00:42:56.649]  I mean, it is one thing to read his Harvard and his Chicago law school papers written a year and a half ago calling for this.
[00:42:57.109 --> 00:43:03.013]  This guy now interprets and runs all executive enforcement of law.
[00:43:04.346 --> 00:43:12.809]  Remember John Yoo, one of the White House lawyers, saying we can bury someone alive, pull their fingernails out, or crush a child's genitals in front of their parents.
[00:43:12.849 --> 00:43:14.109]  He wrote that in a White House memo.
[00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:19.791]  And then the Council on Foreign Relations was even freaked out by one of the members, Professor Castle.
[00:43:20.332 --> 00:43:21.192]  We had him on the show.
[00:43:21.352 --> 00:43:23.013]  He clandestinely recorded it.
[00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:24.273]  That's against CFR rules.
[00:43:24.893 --> 00:43:28.995]  And Castle said, isn't it true, Yoo wrote, that you can torture small children in front of their parents?
[00:43:29.375 --> 00:43:32.056]  And John Yoo said, yes, the President is basically
[00:43:32.916 --> 00:43:33.236]  God.
[00:43:33.557 --> 00:43:34.637]  He can do whatever he wants.
[00:43:35.118 --> 00:43:36.799]  That was just a White House lawyer.
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.141]  This lawyer runs everything.
[00:43:39.421 --> 00:43:41.423]  He tells the Justice Department what to do.
[00:43:41.723 --> 00:43:43.084]  He tells everybody what to do.
[00:43:43.364 --> 00:43:49.529]  He was a Supreme Court clerk, as most later Supreme Court members are.
[00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:53.833]  That's one of the most popular people they tap is someone who worked there out of law school.
[00:43:54.193 --> 00:43:55.394]  He worked for Thurgood Marshall.
[00:43:57.475 --> 00:44:02.979]  This is the man that they tapped at first, and then they picked Sonia Sotomayor, but he's next.
[00:44:03.059 --> 00:44:09.344]  And Ruth Bader Ginsburg is set to step down with health problems in the next year.
[00:44:09.604 --> 00:44:11.666]  And they will ram him through the House and Senate.
[00:44:12.086 --> 00:44:13.967]  They will get him approved in the Senate.
[00:44:13.987 --> 00:44:14.768]  That's where they do that.
[00:44:15.428 --> 00:44:20.172]  And we will be stuck with a man who is engaged in criminal high treason.
[00:44:21.374 --> 00:44:25.517]  As a citizen, you can say there's no right to keep and bear arms and we need to ban them.
[00:44:26.097 --> 00:44:28.619]  But you can't be in a government position and call for that.
[00:44:28.659 --> 00:44:29.400]  That is treason.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:34.323]  And you can't be in a government position and call for arresting people for their free speech.
[00:44:34.643 --> 00:44:43.890]  And you can't be a private citizen and say we need to infiltrate peaceful groups and try to get them to commit acts of violence so we can break up their political movements.
[00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:50.695]  And he says all that in his Harvard paper.
[00:44:52.369 --> 00:44:56.591]  Written by University of Chicago Law School and Harvard University Law School.
[00:44:56.771 --> 00:44:57.311]  Look at it!
[00:44:57.831 --> 00:44:58.231]  Read it!
[00:44:58.791 --> 00:45:01.693]  Don't watch the stinking playoffs this Sunday!
[00:45:01.713 --> 00:45:05.934]  If you care about your future, you better make time to read this!
[00:45:08.975 --> 00:45:12.156]  Governments killed 200 million people.
[00:45:12.477 --> 00:45:16.118]  The same big banks funded the Communists and the Fascists on record.
[00:45:16.698 --> 00:45:18.579]  They go in and loot and rob the middle class.
[00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:25.692]  The same banks funded the Russians in the early 1990s to set up six oligarchs to rob the country.
[00:45:25.752 --> 00:45:27.213]  We know who these people are.
[00:45:29.334 --> 00:45:32.755]  They're George Soros, Rockefeller, Rothschild funded on record.
[00:45:33.036 --> 00:45:35.237]  They openly want to ban your free speech.
[00:45:35.677 --> 00:45:35.957]  Read it.
[00:45:37.216 --> 00:45:49.459]  He says, if you criticize the government in any way, and differ from anything that is government policy, you are to be arrested, or at the bare minimum, newspapers that publish things.
[00:45:49.579 --> 00:45:51.079]  See, for little people, they want to arrest us.
[00:45:51.299 --> 00:45:56.260]  For big newspapers and publications, he says, a special discriminatory tax against you.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:00.741]  We have all the quotes boiled down in Paul Watson's article from yesterday.
[00:46:03.841 --> 00:46:05.542]  Obama information's are outlawed.
[00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:08.210]  Here's another one.
[00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:10.692]  Now, we've actually read the document, and our articles are the most damning.
[00:46:10.712 --> 00:46:16.214]  But you can go to the Village Voice, to Raw Story, to all these big liberal publications.
[00:46:16.914 --> 00:46:18.415]  They have headlines like, Got Fascism?
[00:46:34.042 --> 00:46:35.808]  And they point out how illegal this is.
[00:46:35.868 --> 00:46:39.179]  Now look, I have read the thousands of pages over the years.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.041]  of the COINTELPRO documents.
[00:46:43.782 --> 00:46:50.166]  And if you don't know what COINTELPRO is, you need to just Google the term and go to Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:46:50.647 --> 00:47:02.515]  It's where the FBI and federal government took over state police, namely, and infiltrated mainline, extreme, you name it, churches, any community groups, any soup kitchens, anybody that tried to create local community.
[00:47:02.735 --> 00:47:04.177]  The feds don't want that.
[00:47:04.217 --> 00:47:07.079]  They want collapse of society for dependents.
[00:47:07.099 --> 00:47:10.261]  And they have the same system under Common Purpose in England.
[00:47:12.057 --> 00:47:14.859]  And Cass Sunstein says, we're doing this.
[00:47:14.899 --> 00:47:18.321]  He says, we'll go on the web, we'll pose as conspiracy theorists.
[00:47:18.621 --> 00:47:20.882]  That's anybody that questions any official government dogma.
[00:47:22.583 --> 00:47:26.085]  Because people don't trust the government anymore, or even the government's experts.
[00:47:26.786 --> 00:47:29.367]  So we need to secretly hire experts to go on TV.
[00:47:29.647 --> 00:47:33.149]  He mentions Like Popular Mechanics, which is run by Chertoff's nephew.
[00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.871]  That's right.
[00:47:35.991 --> 00:47:38.813]  Former head of Homeland Security making all this money off of naked body scanners.
[00:47:39.713 --> 00:47:40.494]  And he goes on.
[00:47:42.728 --> 00:47:52.976]  To say that we will go in there and call for violence to run off and break up the groups because these people are pacifists and we know pacifism is the most effective against us, is what he said.
[00:47:53.296 --> 00:47:56.099]  And he said that we'll try to get others to do things illegal so we can arrest them.
[00:47:56.599 --> 00:47:57.440]  Now that's illegal.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.601]  That's more than entrapment.
[00:47:58.641 --> 00:47:59.681]  That's provocateuring.
[00:48:00.462 --> 00:48:01.243]  And it's illegal.
[00:48:01.723 --> 00:48:09.029]  Can you imagine someone set to be the next Supreme Court Justice who openly says on television
[00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:18.967]  That he wants to restrict the Second Amendment, there's no right to keep and bear arms, and that soon the courts will rule in the next three years to overthrow the Second Amendment.
[00:48:19.507 --> 00:48:20.408]  I played that clip earlier.
[00:48:26.192 --> 00:48:29.634]  Can you imagine someone that says there's no right to free speech?
[00:48:30.975 --> 00:48:32.196]  Can you imagine?
[00:48:32.737 --> 00:48:37.060]  That's who the government, that's who Wall Street wants.
[00:48:39.266 --> 00:48:40.608]  And why did they get rid of Van Jones?
[00:48:40.668 --> 00:48:46.554]  He was bad on a lot of fronts, but he was against government-sponsored terror and signed a petition for 9-11 Truth.
[00:48:46.975 --> 00:48:52.080]  This guy says arrest someone if they talk about 9-11 Truth.
[00:48:52.101 --> 00:48:53.202]  He says that should be illegal.
[00:48:59.059 --> 00:49:00.540]  He's an establishment person.
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:03.781]  That's why you're not going to hear much from Fox News about getting rid of him.
[00:49:04.061 --> 00:49:07.482]  We need to push this story out into the open, make it a big issue.
[00:49:07.742 --> 00:49:22.507]  But hell, they're keeping White House science czar John P. Holdren, who wrote the 1,100-page book, Ecoscience, calling for poisoning the water supply to sterilize the public, and who calls for, quote, planetary dictatorship to carry out the orderly extermination of the population.
[00:49:23.147 --> 00:49:24.268]  I mean, this is, that's what I mean.
[00:49:24.468 --> 00:49:28.149]  Every czar is a ultra-radical extremist
[00:49:29.286 --> 00:49:32.027]  Would be enslaver and killer!
[00:49:32.787 --> 00:49:37.748]  I mean, you cannot... These writings are worse than Hitler, Stalin, Lenin and Mao.
[00:49:37.828 --> 00:49:38.588]  I've read their writings.
[00:49:38.628 --> 00:49:39.408]  I've read Mein Kampf.
[00:49:39.788 --> 00:49:41.168]  I've read the writings of Lenin and Stalin.
[00:49:41.188 --> 00:49:42.049]  I've read Martian Engels.
[00:49:42.449 --> 00:49:43.849]  They weren't even this bold in print.
[00:49:43.869 --> 00:49:46.470]  I mean, they're telling you what they're going to do to you.
[00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:50.130]  I've never seen anything like it in my life.
[00:49:52.671 --> 00:49:54.051]  And he goes on and on.
[00:49:54.071 --> 00:49:56.111]  I'm going to play some of these audio clips for radio listeners.
[00:49:56.552 --> 00:49:58.292]  Video clips for
[00:50:01.974 --> 00:50:04.609]  For the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, I just...
[00:50:05.658 --> 00:50:06.539]  It's unending.
[00:50:06.639 --> 00:50:14.465]  The books, the white papers, the videos of them saying, oh, I love Mao, oh, I love Lenin, oh, I love Stalin, oh, my God, I can't wait to arrest all these people.
[00:50:14.885 --> 00:50:20.829]  Editorials written by Daily Kos about how they can't wait to use the military against American gun owners.
[00:50:20.889 --> 00:50:31.457]  Just frothing, wicked, demonic, horrible tyrants launching all these new wars, masquerading with lisping, effeminate, fake liberal voices.
[00:50:32.198 --> 00:50:33.579]  They're not liberals, folks.
[00:50:33.599 --> 00:50:34.640]  These are monsters!
[00:50:36.169 --> 00:50:37.891]  They're as liberal as Joe Stalin!
[00:50:37.931 --> 00:50:45.198]  I mean, it's just... And the average, limp-wristed, patchouli-wearing liberal running around thinking they're... You people are sick, man.
[00:50:45.238 --> 00:50:46.079]  You are sick!
[00:50:47.287 --> 00:50:50.149]  I mean, I am absolutely shaken by these people.
[00:50:50.189 --> 00:50:51.110]  We must resist them!
[00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:52.751]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:52.791 --> 00:50:58.134]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:50:58.395 --> 00:51:03.018]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:03.398 --> 00:51:08.481]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:51:08.982 --> 00:51:13.605]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:14.125 --> 00:51:21.052]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:21.252 --> 00:51:22.153]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:22.353 --> 00:51:28.739]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:31.902]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:32.243 --> 00:51:34.145]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:34.465 --> 00:51:35.386]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:40.813]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:41.995 --> 00:51:47.784]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:50.469]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:51.184 --> 00:51:59.589]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[00:51:59.889 --> 00:52:04.972]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[00:52:05.012 --> 00:52:05.573]  and Canada.
[00:52:05.873 --> 00:52:12.417]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[00:52:12.977 --> 00:52:16.240]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:18.621]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[00:52:18.822 --> 00:52:25.186]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.

[00:53:09.337 --> 00:53:11.139]  Because we buy direct from the mills.
[00:53:11.419 --> 00:53:13.421]  We are truly the wood floor experts.

[00:53:41.501 --> 00:53:41.801]  That's 1-800-580-7310.
[00:53:41.821 --> 00:53:41.881]  1-800-580-7310.
[00:53:41.901 --> 00:53:42.582]  You look like an angel.
[00:53:42.602 --> 00:53:43.362]  Walk like an angel.
[00:53:43.383 --> 00:53:44.363]  Talk like an angel.
[00:54:12.597 --> 00:54:15.318]  Oh, yes you are, big government Obama!
[00:54:15.338 --> 00:54:18.780]  Yeah, we're wise to you.
[00:54:19.281 --> 00:54:27.085]  Now, I want everybody to listen to me very, very carefully, because I'm going to lay out the enemy's battle plan.
[00:54:28.755 --> 00:54:39.581]  Why do you think, in Europe and the United States, masses of poor immigrants have been brought in and paid to be brought in, in many cases, by the government?
[00:54:40.142 --> 00:54:46.905]  Why do you think, in Minnesota, they've brought in more than a million people in just the last decade?
[00:54:46.965 --> 00:54:49.347]  In Minnesota alone, the government pays to fly them there.
[00:54:50.885 --> 00:55:03.452]  Because then the government gets them on welfare, keeps them as basically kept political slaves, who will then vote for gun control, vote for open borders, vote for restrictions in free speech, for tiny little payoffs.
[00:55:04.233 --> 00:55:05.954]  And they tell them, oh, you're going to get free health care.
[00:55:06.034 --> 00:55:08.955]  Then they raise everybody's taxes, cut everybody's health care.
[00:55:09.196 --> 00:55:10.656]  They even rip off the slaves.
[00:55:10.917 --> 00:55:12.317]  The slaves don't know that, though.
[00:55:12.858 --> 00:55:14.499]  They come from countries of enslavement.
[00:55:15.259 --> 00:55:16.180]  They don't know any better.
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:19.782]  They didn't have George Washington to set things up.
[00:55:20.748 --> 00:55:23.590]  That's why the system demonizes this country, because it's been the best.
[00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:26.091]  It's not perfect, but heads above everything else.
[00:55:26.811 --> 00:55:27.672]  Heads and shoulders.
[00:55:28.192 --> 00:55:29.273]  Mountains above many.
[00:55:30.854 --> 00:55:39.919]  So, they're bringing them in here, and when you read what these people write, they go, very soon we're going to be basically half-foreigner, and there's nothing the middle class can do, we're going to take over and arrest them.
[00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:43.361]  They actually do want... Folks, think about it.
[00:55:44.301 --> 00:55:45.342]  Every one of these czars,
[00:55:46.042 --> 00:55:47.984]  Says, we are going to ban your guns.
[00:55:48.064 --> 00:55:53.088]  They introduce the bills where the Attorney General can ban any and all guns he wants to himself.
[00:55:53.688 --> 00:55:55.450]  If you're on a no-fly, you're on a no-buy.
[00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:56.451]  All of this stuff.
[00:55:56.891 --> 00:55:59.653]  Then they say, we don't know why people are saying we want your guns.
[00:55:59.954 --> 00:56:01.855]  We don't know why there's record purchases of guns.
[00:56:02.075 --> 00:56:03.917]  Because people actually went and read the bills!
[00:56:04.737 --> 00:56:08.761]  But see, Cass Sunstein in his conspiracy theory papers and reports says,
[00:56:10.106 --> 00:56:12.907]  If people think there's a move to get their guns, it's a conspiracy.
[00:56:12.967 --> 00:56:14.087]  But I do want to ban them.
[00:56:14.647 --> 00:56:19.749]  See, it's a mental game he plays, where he's God, you're the child, and he tells you what to do.
[00:56:19.989 --> 00:56:21.490]  He says there's no global government.
[00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:26.931]  Does it matter if Ban Ki-moon's Secretary General of the UN calls for it in the New York Times and speeches in the last month?
[00:56:27.232 --> 00:56:34.474]  It doesn't matter if Herman Von Ruppe, the head of the EU, calls for it and says Copenhagen treaty is to bring in world government taxes to be paid to offshore banks.
[00:56:35.134 --> 00:56:40.939]  It doesn't matter if Open World Government's being announced literally in thousands of newspapers in the last year.
[00:56:40.959 --> 00:56:41.840]  Go to Google.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.983]  Type in global government, global governance, and click news.
[00:56:46.544 --> 00:56:50.527]  And it'll show you just in the last week how many articles there have been in the first block.
[00:56:51.528 --> 00:56:59.855]  When they had the G20, there were over 2,200 articles in one week calling for new world order, world government.
[00:57:00.476 --> 00:57:02.578]  Now, they're openly announcing world government,
[00:57:03.922 --> 00:57:07.504]  But Cass Sunstein says you're not allowed to talk about it.
[00:57:08.065 --> 00:57:09.806]  You're not allowed to address that it's real.
[00:57:10.246 --> 00:57:11.487]  You're not allowed to discuss it.
[00:57:11.827 --> 00:57:12.688]  It doesn't exist.
[00:57:13.048 --> 00:57:14.069]  You need to be arrested.
[00:57:18.251 --> 00:57:19.852]  Look, there's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:57:19.933 --> 00:57:20.833]  Global government.
[00:57:23.175 --> 00:57:24.856]  Look at all those global governments right there.
[00:57:26.124 --> 00:57:31.447]  You can go read thousands and thousands, 94,000 hits came up under Google News!
[00:57:32.048 --> 00:57:34.530]  This isn't web, this is newspapers!
[00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:41.374]  But according to Cass Sunstein, you need to be banned, you need to be arrested, if you say it exists.
[00:57:42.475 --> 00:57:50.300]  And again, in his own white paper report written a year and a half ago, he now implements all federal regulations and laws,
[00:57:54.178 --> 00:57:57.803]  He says, you will not be allowed to say and it will be made illegal.
[00:57:58.544 --> 00:57:59.025]  Go read it!
[00:57:59.706 --> 00:58:01.709]  To say sunlight is good for you.
[00:58:02.269 --> 00:58:04.433]  This ridiculous conspiracy theory must be banned!
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:08.561]  See, that sounds crazy.
[00:58:08.621 --> 00:58:09.522]  It sounds asinine.
[00:58:09.582 --> 00:58:10.163]  It's meant to.
[00:58:10.864 --> 00:58:13.586]  He may say you can't drink milk on Wednesdays.
[00:58:14.127 --> 00:58:15.849]  He may say you've got to wear a purple hat.
[00:58:16.249 --> 00:58:18.952]  It's all about training you to do what they say.
[00:58:19.433 --> 00:58:20.814]  They mean to be outrageous.
[00:58:21.054 --> 00:58:25.359]  They mean to bustle in like a bully and squat on you and spit in your face.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.201]  He wants your guns.
[00:58:27.441 --> 00:58:28.282]  He wants your freedom.
[00:58:28.422 --> 00:58:29.243]  He wants your kids.
[00:58:29.403 --> 00:58:30.044]  He's a criminal!
[00:58:32.967 --> 00:58:35.029]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:46.281 --> 00:59:49.042]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:55.569 --> 00:59:56.210]  Big Brother.
[00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:57.911]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:58.652 --> 00:59:59.733]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:00.394 --> 01:00:01.215]  You want answers?
[01:00:01.975 --> 01:00:02.916]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.557 --> 01:00:07.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.721 --> 01:00:11.765]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.294 --> 01:00:17.197]  Bob Chapman joins us once a week in the third hour on Fridays.
[01:00:17.217 --> 01:00:20.620]  He's coming up in the next segment with us.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:39.013]  I'm going to play some audio and video clips of Cass Sunstein, President Obama's appointee to head the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and the man who outlined a plan for the government to infiltrate conspiracy groups in order to undermine them in direct line for a promotion to Supreme Court justice.
[01:00:39.414 --> 01:00:40.695]  And he says illegally!
[01:00:42.332 --> 01:00:49.193]  That he wants to go in and try to get them to commit violence, to break up the peaceful people, and so they can provocateur and arrest others.
[01:00:49.554 --> 01:00:51.714]  He says he wants to ban free speech in America.
[01:00:51.734 --> 01:00:52.714]  We're going to go over those quotes.
[01:00:53.054 --> 01:00:58.475]  He says you have no right to keep and bear arms, that they will overturn it within the next three years at the Supreme Court.
[01:00:58.895 --> 01:00:59.996]  That clip is coming up.
[01:01:00.576 --> 01:01:03.476]  He says he is going to get your guns.
[01:01:04.217 --> 01:01:06.557]  And he also talks about how much he loves communists.
[01:01:07.437 --> 01:01:10.678]  I mean, every czar I look at says Mao is great.
[01:01:11.744 --> 01:01:12.504]  Lenin is great.
[01:01:12.545 --> 01:01:15.086]  Hugo Chavez banning people's free speech is great.
[01:01:16.747 --> 01:01:17.747]  This is quite a crew.
[01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:24.471]  And remember, we had the Bush White House in reports saying they wanted to infiltrate and try to shut down conspiracy theorists.
[01:01:24.792 --> 01:01:37.219]  But the most important thing in all of this is, he says in the report, and this is all in the articles we have posted, direct links to his white papers and videos, he says the conspiracy people are very dangerous.
[01:01:39.454 --> 01:01:43.775]  He says the conspiracy people are very, very dangerous.
[01:01:44.635 --> 01:01:46.216]  And why does he say we're dangerous?
[01:01:46.316 --> 01:01:47.696]  Because we're telling the truth.
[01:01:47.976 --> 01:01:54.958]  He calls anyone questioning anything the government says, if you think Goldman Sachs is corrupt, it's insane, it doesn't exist.
[01:01:55.078 --> 01:01:56.839]  It is mass mental illness.
[01:01:56.899 --> 01:02:00.980]  It is mass programming where they tell you what you can and can't think.
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:01.300]  This is 1984.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.921]  We're going to Bob Chapman right after this quick break.
[01:02:05.281 --> 01:02:08.462]  Before we come back and get into this with Bob and the economy and a lot more,
[01:02:09.602 --> 01:02:12.543]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's show possible.
[01:02:12.743 --> 01:02:13.804]  A Cola Blue is one of them.
[01:02:13.824 --> 01:02:18.946]  They've got a special running until Sunday evening where you get $150 value.
[01:02:19.447 --> 01:02:24.529]  You get two years of free filters with the water filtration system that grabs water.
[01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:28.573]  Out of the atmosphere itself.
[01:02:28.693 --> 01:02:29.975]  Ecolablue.com.
[01:02:30.435 --> 01:02:33.879]  They've got the Ecolablue 28, the Ecolablue 30 and a bunch of other great units.
[01:02:34.179 --> 01:02:36.101]  People ought to buy these and send them to Haiti if you can get them there.
[01:02:36.121 --> 01:02:39.785]  They're trying to get a huge unit that can supply thousands of people there for free right now.
[01:02:41.066 --> 01:02:42.648]  But it's hard to get stuff into the country.

[01:03:04.144 --> 01:03:06.666]  Continuing a new silver solution.
[01:03:06.726 --> 01:03:11.489]  People all over the world are discovering the benefits, while the government's moving to restrict it, of supernatural silver.
[01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:17.052]  The powerful new nanotechnology is a natural antibiotic and preventative against infections, germs, and disease.
[01:03:17.072 --> 01:03:19.354]  According to them, all the scientific reports they have on their site.
[01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:22.716]  Silver is one of the oldest natural antibiotics and is a non-toxic.
[01:03:23.097 --> 01:03:23.537]  It goes on.
[01:03:23.597 --> 01:03:26.700]  Visit their new link at InfoWars.com and see the studies for yourself.

[01:03:37.984 --> 01:03:38.104]  That's
[01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.610]  I think?
[01:04:14.239 --> 01:04:19.600]  There have been times in American history, pilgrims for example, when seeds are the highest value of barter item, even silver or gold.
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:22.181]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds with the U.N.
[01:04:22.321 --> 01:04:24.841]  buying up all the companies and hoarding them near the Arctic Circle.
[01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:25.982]  That's now come out in the news.

[01:04:43.906 --> 01:04:49.988]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman and the open announcements that they are going to take your guns by the White House.
[01:04:50.748 --> 01:04:54.990]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:59.372]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:04:59.632 --> 01:05:05.034]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:05.374 --> 01:05:05.834]  It's true.
[01:05:06.134 --> 01:05:10.676]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:10.996 --> 01:05:11.537]  Number 3.
[01:05:11.817 --> 01:05:15.100]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:19.123]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:19.324 --> 01:05:19.864]  Number 4.
[01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:22.486]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:22.867 --> 01:05:26.270]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:26.570 --> 01:05:26.770]  Number 5.
[01:05:27.351 --> 01:05:31.274]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:31.495 --> 01:05:36.259]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:36.539 --> 01:05:40.583]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:42.285]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:42.485 --> 01:05:44.587]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:05:44.747 --> 01:05:47.090]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:05:52.418 --> 01:05:56.039]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:56.379 --> 01:06:04.520]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:09.281]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:09.861 --> 01:06:20.683]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:21.323 --> 01:06:30.326]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:30.826 --> 01:06:35.868]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:36.268 --> 01:06:43.451]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:43.751 --> 01:06:46.492]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:51.678 --> 01:06:55.260]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:58.642]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:58.883 --> 01:07:03.645]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:03.665 --> 01:07:09.929]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:12.311]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:12.811 --> 01:07:13.111]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:13.151 --> 01:07:13.552]  Bernanke?
[01:07:13.652 --> 01:07:14.252]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:14.312 --> 01:07:14.973]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:14.993 --> 01:07:17.114]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:31.744 --> 01:07:33.565]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:33.585 --> 01:07:38.688]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:07:39.008 --> 01:07:48.953]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:51.714 --> 01:07:57.277]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:01.755 --> 01:08:07.937]  Ladies and gentlemen, I went over all the quotes yesterday, actual quotes, and I'm going to go back over them again.
[01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:24.684]  From his report, Cass R. Sunstein, now the head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, he says they're going to ban free speech, ban freedom on talk radio, ban internet freedom.
[01:08:25.635 --> 01:08:27.838]  He says the Second Amendment will be overturned.
[01:08:27.858 --> 01:08:30.281]  He says there's no history of freedom, that it's made up.
[01:08:30.882 --> 01:08:40.553]  He says watch in the next three years, and he said this a year ago, we will, this is a quote, we will, don't be surprised if we overturn the Second Amendment, and laughs about it.
[01:08:41.174 --> 01:08:43.878]  And he's set to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[01:08:45.157 --> 01:08:49.603]  Obama's favorite for Supreme Court Justice Sunstein wants to ban guns and free speech.
[01:08:50.004 --> 01:08:57.274]  We have the actual quotes and video more than we can air here at PrisonPlanet.com in this paramount article.
[01:08:59.175 --> 01:09:01.276]  Paramount article that this get out to everyone.
[01:09:01.296 --> 01:09:05.037]  You know, I saw news articles about how, oh, he calls for fascism, the liberals said.
[01:09:05.077 --> 01:09:06.137]  Oh, he calls for censorship.
[01:09:06.438 --> 01:09:07.618]  He calls for COINTELPRO.
[01:09:07.858 --> 01:09:09.399]  COINTELPRO is illegal!
[01:09:09.759 --> 01:09:16.701]  It's illegal to go start groups and lead them to violence to blame it on conservatives or libertarians or peace groups.
[01:09:17.081 --> 01:09:18.002]  It's illegal!
[01:09:18.602 --> 01:09:22.763]  It was found to be legal in Congress and in the courts in the 1970s and 80s.
[01:09:24.244 --> 01:09:25.324]  I've got it all right here.
[01:09:25.845 --> 01:09:26.665]  COINTELPRO.
[01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:36.859]  According to the FBI records, 85% of COINTELPRO resources were expended on infiltrating, disrupting, marginalizing, and subverting groups suspected of being subversive.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:38.020]  It's illegal!
[01:09:40.423 --> 01:09:45.568]  It included the FBI putting out stories about Martin Luther King, which were proven to be lies about him whoremongering.
[01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:50.172]  They attack groups by saying, oh, the leader's making too much money.
[01:09:50.212 --> 01:09:53.894]  Or they attack groups that are effective by saying the leaders are racist.
[01:09:53.934 --> 01:09:57.096]  Or they attack groups by turning people inside their organizations against each other.
[01:09:57.377 --> 01:10:00.138]  Or getting people hired into the organizations to commit crimes.
[01:10:01.079 --> 01:10:04.841]  Or they create other alternative media groups and then have them attack.
[01:10:05.062 --> 01:10:06.483]  And he talks about how to do that.
[01:10:07.643 --> 01:10:10.805]  How they go out and how they masquerade as us.
[01:10:12.523 --> 01:10:23.533]  To then demonize the Patriot Movement, anybody that's against government corruption, and even more importantly, he says we will ban conspiracy theories, and that means any criticism of government.
[01:10:24.133 --> 01:10:35.864]  He defines conspiracy theories like global warming not being real, or thinking the banks are corrupt, or questioning the official story of 9-11, which Farmer, the head of the 9-11 Commission Lawyers, says is a cover-up.
[01:10:36.404 --> 01:10:37.826]  And six of the ten members say that.
[01:10:39.281 --> 01:10:40.742]  They get to define reality.
[01:10:40.782 --> 01:10:45.204]  They get to say 2 plus 2 equals 50, not 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:10:48.106 --> 01:10:50.487]  He says it will be an outlawed conspiracy theory.
[01:10:50.527 --> 01:10:51.908]  You've got to read this for yourself, folks.
[01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:54.730]  This is published by Harvard and Chicago Law School, written by him.
[01:10:55.911 --> 01:11:00.913]  He says it is an outrageous conspiracy theory to say that sunlight is good for you.
[01:11:00.973 --> 01:11:01.734]  This will be banned.
[01:11:03.424 --> 01:11:06.046]  When every major study shows you need at least some sunlight.
[01:11:06.786 --> 01:11:09.788]  I mean, but even if it wasn't true, it's your right to say it!
[01:11:10.028 --> 01:11:15.351]  And he says we'll put a tax on talk radio and the internet and people we don't like to begin with and then outright ban them.
[01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:16.532]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen...
[01:11:18.206 --> 01:11:19.547]  We've written five articles on it.
[01:11:19.587 --> 01:11:23.790]  Sunstein attacks 2nd Amendment, InfoWars.com, with links to videos and his own writings.
[01:11:24.171 --> 01:11:26.533]  ObamaInformationsR calls for banning free speech.
[01:11:27.133 --> 01:11:30.936]  ObamaInformationsR outlined plan for government to infiltrate conspiracy groups.
[01:11:31.657 --> 01:11:41.805]  And the most, of all the important things, one of the most important is he says these people are incredibly effective conspiracy groups, people that say the government's corrupt.
[01:11:43.479 --> 01:11:47.600]  These people that say there's a world government are very effective and they're undermining our takeover.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.621]  So we need to arrest them.
[01:11:49.921 --> 01:11:51.101]  We need to infiltrate them.
[01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:56.623]  But he admits that we are powerful, and that the truth is powerful, and that they're in deep trouble.
[01:11:56.663 --> 01:11:58.583]  And then I went and looked, and I already looked at a bunch of them.
[01:11:59.043 --> 01:12:02.404]  Every czar saying Mao Zedong is good.
[01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:06.586]  Every czar saying we need to ban free speech like Chavez has done.
[01:12:06.646 --> 01:12:08.286]  His diversity czar had said that.
[01:12:08.746 --> 01:12:11.047]  I mean, these people are outrageous.
[01:12:12.421 --> 01:12:14.341]  That's why the White House got rid of Van Jones.
[01:12:14.742 --> 01:12:16.882]  Not because of all the heat on him saying he was a communist.
[01:12:18.222 --> 01:12:20.423]  But because he said 9-11 might be an inside job.
[01:12:20.443 --> 01:12:22.803]  He had some soul to tell the truth.
[01:12:24.084 --> 01:12:31.786]  They didn't get rid of the White House science czar who called for forced sterilization of the public through the water supply and a planetary dictatorship to carry it out.
[01:12:32.086 --> 01:12:32.866]  Ecoscience?
[01:12:33.926 --> 01:12:36.287]  Mainstream News, Associated Press, Fox News?
[01:12:37.327 --> 01:12:37.487]  No!
[01:12:39.366 --> 01:12:44.209]  They got rid of Jones because he was, at some level, a real activist, even if I disagree with his politics.
[01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:47.891]  For the rest of the hour, Bob Chapman normally joins us.
[01:12:48.152 --> 01:12:55.056]  Army intelligence, fought the communists, was the biggest private silver and gold broker ever, lived in South Africa, France, Germany, all over the world.
[01:12:58.968 --> 01:13:00.189]  Expert on the economy.
[01:13:00.569 --> 01:13:04.050]  I get him on about that, but he also is an expert on these people who have been fighting him for 45 years.
[01:13:04.570 --> 01:13:11.093]  Bob, I had read articles months ago about Sunstein in mainstream news saying, oh, he does want to restrict the internet.
[01:13:11.193 --> 01:13:11.873]  Is that fair?
[01:13:11.933 --> 01:13:13.254]  Like it's mainstream and okay.
[01:13:13.854 --> 01:13:17.455]  I hadn't actually read or watched the videos of him and watching it.
[01:13:17.756 --> 01:13:20.517]  And then when I put the name Czar in, I found a bunch of other clips.
[01:13:21.457 --> 01:13:26.860]  You know, I'd put in, Obama czar calls for banning guns, and I'd find six, seven, eight other czars saying it.
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:29.281]  I mean, this is worse than I thought, Bob Chapman.
[01:13:29.481 --> 01:13:37.105]  These people are arrogantly and openly out in the open saying, if you say anything we disagree with, we are going to arrest you.
[01:13:37.485 --> 01:13:39.186]  And we are going to take your guns.
[01:13:39.306 --> 01:13:40.586]  I mean, it's incredible, Bob.
[01:13:40.606 --> 01:13:42.627]  You're right.
[01:13:42.947 --> 01:13:45.929]  And they finally have totally come into the open.
[01:13:46.627 --> 01:13:54.149]  And so, evidently, over the next year or so, or perhaps two, they're going to attempt to get people's guns.
[01:13:54.909 --> 01:13:59.490]  And I think how they're going to do it is by joining in with the U.N.
[01:14:00.090 --> 01:14:01.531]  and using the U.N.
[01:14:01.571 --> 01:14:03.891]  excuse to go and collect everybody's guns.
[01:14:03.911 --> 01:14:05.072]  The treaty!
[01:14:05.112 --> 01:14:06.192]  That's Associated Press.
[01:14:06.532 --> 01:14:11.353]  Obama says he's going to sign the treaty, and even if the Senate doesn't ratify it, the U.N.
[01:14:11.373 --> 01:14:13.294]  treaty says no private ownership of guns.
[01:14:13.354 --> 01:14:14.834]  I mean, it's really happening!
[01:14:17.096 --> 01:14:22.137]  Well, you know this infiltration business, it's been going on for years.
[01:14:23.317 --> 01:14:44.461]  I ran into it starting in 1965, and I actually had a friend of mine who was working in a store, and he was also a person who was an expert in weapons, and he was a person who fixed them as well.
[01:14:45.613 --> 01:15:05.221]  And he got a visit one day from the FBI and the BATF and they said that if he didn't cooperate with them they were going to put him in jail and trying to put me in jail and because I was outspoken.
[01:15:06.082 --> 01:15:09.543]  And so they have been doing this sort of thing for years and years.
[01:15:10.123 --> 01:15:12.184]  They've been infiltrating groups for years.
[01:15:12.724 --> 01:15:14.425]  It's not only the federal government
[01:15:15.074 --> 01:15:22.340]  But the federal government, like with the FBI, would go to local police departments and recruit them.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.121]  Yeah, mainly state police.
[01:15:25.642 --> 01:15:28.685]  Well, yeah, with state police, but they wanted it to the local level.
[01:15:28.725 --> 01:15:36.831]  And I've discussed this with either the Los Angeles for a long time with the LAPD, because I used to shoot with a lot of those people.
[01:15:37.692 --> 01:15:48.075]  And also with someone who was second in command there who went to take over the Beverly Hills Police Department who was a next door neighbor of mine eventually.
[01:15:49.015 --> 01:15:51.996]  And so he told me exactly what they were doing.
[01:15:52.777 --> 01:15:54.477]  And so it's really nothing new.
[01:15:54.617 --> 01:15:57.098]  It's just that they've been doing it illegally for years.
[01:15:57.718 --> 01:16:00.239]  And now these people have come out and said the game's over for you.
[01:16:00.879 --> 01:16:04.980]  You can't speak about the government against the government or question the government anymore.
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.801]  And we're going to come and get your guns.
[01:16:07.722 --> 01:16:15.586]  So I think people have got to decide and make plans for what they're going to do and these eventualities.
[01:16:16.186 --> 01:16:31.294]  Well that's the nail on the head, is that it came out in Congress, people went to jail, COINTELPRO is illegal, and then you have the White House head of Information and Regulatory Affairs who implements all this executive bureaucracy.
[01:16:31.574 --> 01:16:35.136]  He decides what they can do and he's saying we're doing this
[01:16:36.357 --> 01:16:38.859]  He's openly calling for committing crimes.
[01:16:39.179 --> 01:16:39.980]  That's the difference.
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.482]  Why would they arrogantly come out in the open?
[01:16:42.522 --> 01:16:48.087]  Is this a public threat or a way to legitimize it with all their minions who go, is this really legal?
[01:16:49.728 --> 01:16:50.528]  I think it's a threat.
[01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:56.653]  This is a threat, especially when you have that many people saying relatively the same thing.
[01:16:57.274 --> 01:16:58.935]  They're saying, we're going to come and get you.
[01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:01.938]  This is the male mentality.
[01:17:06.945 --> 01:17:07.986]  What do you say to that?
[01:17:08.566 --> 01:17:16.072]  I mean, how many groups are there in the United States who get together and are militia or shoot or whatever?
[01:17:16.092 --> 01:17:20.315]  And, you know, there's not that many people who do that.
[01:17:21.375 --> 01:17:30.442]  You know, it could be a smokescreen as well to make the people who would vote for them to keep them in office.
[01:17:32.183 --> 01:17:34.905]  They're appealing to people who don't want people to have guns.
[01:17:35.802 --> 01:17:39.810]  You also have to consider, too, maybe the blatancy that you're seeing right now is
[01:17:41.650 --> 01:17:52.557]  A follow-up to the plunge in approval of the President, which is running somewhere between 35 and 40, depending upon which subject that you choose.
[01:17:52.657 --> 01:18:03.064]  Well, what about how he goes on, Bob, to say, and I'm going to find a quote here in a moment, I read it several times yesterday, he says, these people are very effective, they're taking over, they threaten us, and he doesn't just say gun owners.
[01:18:03.484 --> 01:18:06.266]  He says, anyone criticizing government
[01:18:06.926 --> 01:18:10.427]  Including, if you say sunlight is good for you, that will be illegal.
[01:18:10.647 --> 01:18:11.888]  I mean, that is cuckoo.
[01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:18.190]  I mean, he's saying, I am God, you cannot have any alternate opinion of what we say or you're arrested.
[01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:34.635]  Well, he's talking about you and I and people like us, and quite frankly, Alex, we've talked about the success that we've had, and we've got the conspiracy running all over the place trying to find out what to do next because we've got them on the run.
[01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:39.055]  And that probably prompted some of these recent statements as well.
[01:18:39.856 --> 01:18:41.278]  We've been very, very effective.
[01:18:41.999 --> 01:18:43.702]  And what will they try to do?
[01:18:43.762 --> 01:18:44.643]  We don't know yet.
[01:18:45.184 --> 01:18:47.868]  But I don't know that the people are going to sit still for it.
[01:18:51.519 --> 01:18:54.321]  There's something psychological going on here because I see it over and over again.
[01:18:54.341 --> 01:18:57.303]  He says there's no such thing as a global government.
[01:18:57.343 --> 01:18:58.844]  If you say that, you'll be arrested.
[01:18:59.184 --> 01:19:01.626]  When it's all over the news, they're establishing world government.
[01:19:01.666 --> 01:19:03.547]  So he knows it's all going on.
[01:19:03.567 --> 01:19:04.228]  He's pushing it.
[01:19:04.708 --> 01:19:10.492]  But he's just saying, look, you don't see anything like the mafia says or you're going to sleep with the fishes.
[01:19:11.052 --> 01:19:14.054]  He's saying you do what we say.
[01:19:14.334 --> 01:19:21.299]  And he picks something like the conspiracy theory that sunlight's good for you to just make it asininely broad.
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:23.300]  Mm-hmm.
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:24.400]  That's right.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.261]  So they can do anything they want.
[01:19:27.781 --> 01:19:32.162]  But I think there... I mean, I think there is some megalomania mental illness here, though.
[01:19:32.983 --> 01:19:39.665]  I mean, to have them openly praising Mao, openly praising arresting us... I mean, I mean, these guys really must think they're invincible.
[01:19:39.845 --> 01:19:41.525]  But then he goes on to admit they're in trouble.
[01:19:42.226 --> 01:19:47.527]  I guess it's like cockroaches when you poison your house, and before they die, they all start fornicating.
[01:19:48.088 --> 01:19:49.328]  We'll be right back with Bob Chavin.
[01:19:51.849 --> 01:19:59.053]  For the first time ever, the makers of Alpine Air Foods have approved an incredible sale with savings only available through ready-made resources.

[01:21:25.976 --> 01:21:27.397]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:21:27.737 --> 01:21:29.999]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:21:30.259 --> 01:21:34.622]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.

[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:55.262]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[01:21:55.543 --> 01:21:58.384]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[01:21:58.804 --> 01:22:06.609]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[01:22:06.869 --> 01:22:07.389]  We're good to go.

[01:22:55.599 --> 01:22:57.361]  What if you could avoid bypass surgery?
[01:22:57.501 --> 01:22:59.843]  Would it not be nice to have your heartbeat regularly again?
[01:23:00.023 --> 01:23:01.244]  To have a sex life again?

[01:23:54.597 --> 01:24:04.885]  It's clear that the establishment wanted to use the backlash against Bush, who was only carrying out the globalist policy, to bring in their new puppet to build him up as a messianic leader, Obama.
[01:24:05.686 --> 01:24:09.689]  He has now fallen faster than any president ever in the approval rating.
[01:24:09.889 --> 01:24:11.030]  Mainstream News says about 40.
[01:24:11.210 --> 01:24:14.413]  A lot of the other polls show 35, as Bob Chapman mentioned.
[01:24:14.913 --> 01:24:21.459]  So they really wanted to come in with a type of red terror with the banks using their communists, as they always do, to loot and rob everybody.
[01:24:22.259 --> 01:24:22.479]  I don't
[01:24:42.248 --> 01:24:42.629]  Right now.
[01:24:42.729 --> 01:24:45.233]  So yeah, they are blustering saying, okay, we're going to take your guns.
[01:24:45.253 --> 01:24:46.135]  We're going to arrest you.
[01:24:46.476 --> 01:24:49.521]  But this is what he was saying in white papers for the White House.
[01:24:50.723 --> 01:24:55.491]  I don't even know if it was meant for public, but it's in mainstream news that they're all saying this.
[01:24:58.692 --> 01:25:03.716]  I see the biggest problem, Bob, is they brought in all these illegal aliens as their clients in Europe and the U.S.
[01:25:04.056 --> 01:25:08.600]  to pull the lever to vote for this, and so they think they're going to win still long term.
[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:09.500]  What do we do?
[01:25:09.621 --> 01:25:11.962]  Educate the populations they brought in?
[01:25:11.982 --> 01:25:15.905]  No, I don't think that's possible.
[01:25:17.267 --> 01:25:26.654]  Most of them are people who don't have beyond 6th grade educations, and I don't think that's easily doable.
[01:25:27.572 --> 01:25:38.617]  Um, I think when they would get into a difficult economic situation, uh, that you might be able to appeal to them, uh, just on a common sense basis.
[01:25:39.477 --> 01:25:41.998]  Uh, but that's, that's a hard thing to do.
[01:25:42.038 --> 01:25:51.642]  We've got to keep on trying to get at the mainstream American who sees things going on and doesn't have an explanation.
[01:25:51.742 --> 01:25:55.644]  And we've got the explanation forum, which is reasonable and truthful.
[01:25:56.514 --> 01:25:59.195]  And, you know, they're stalling for time.
[01:26:00.415 --> 01:26:08.297]  The longer they stall, the better it is for us because it gives us the opportunity to try to accomplish what we've been accomplishing.
[01:26:09.237 --> 01:26:16.999]  I think, you know, I hate to hear what he had to say, but I'm glad to hear we're pushing them right to the edge.
[01:26:17.319 --> 01:26:18.759]  They are running around in circles.
[01:26:20.953 --> 01:26:31.980]  But again, they now admit, mainstream news, I printed several articles today, that he's the guy tapped, that's why they moved him into the White House, to be the next Supreme Court Justice when Ginsburg leaves.
[01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:37.504]  I mean, how could you have someone for Supreme Court who openly says, ban free speech?
[01:26:37.544 --> 01:26:43.208]  He actually says, let me read quotes, government might ban conspiracy theories.
[01:26:44.328 --> 01:26:45.009]  That's a quote.
[01:26:45.289 --> 01:26:50.211]  Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories.
[01:26:50.251 --> 01:26:53.873]  Then he lists them as global warming is a deliberate fraud.
[01:26:53.993 --> 01:26:54.413]  Illegal.
[01:26:55.494 --> 01:26:57.314]  As saying there's a plan to get our guns.
[01:26:57.675 --> 01:27:00.816]  While he separately gives speeches saying they are going to ban them.
[01:27:04.638 --> 01:27:06.499]  Desperate people do desperate things.
[01:27:07.279 --> 01:27:08.340]  It's a counterattack.
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:10.781]  And it's not going to work.
[01:27:11.595 --> 01:27:14.757]  Unless they try to implement them and then they'll have to deal with the public.
[01:27:15.958 --> 01:27:22.321]  The longer it takes them to implement them, the better it is for us because we get more time to educate people.
[01:27:23.442 --> 01:27:25.203]  It has been an educational process.
[01:27:32.122 --> 01:27:50.154]  But just as a red-blooded human who wants freedom, when I see people openly praising Mao, and saying they're going to take my guns, and saying they're going to ban my free speech, I mean, I literally have been in a super aggressive mood the last day and a half, hopping around the office, barely controlling myself, punching holes in walls.
[01:27:50.454 --> 01:27:57.839]  I'm not even really angry, I'm just in absolute war mode, where I, I mean, you know what I'm talking about, I mean, I know a threat of a bunch of dirty,
[01:27:58.399 --> 01:28:04.820]  Scum openly calling for criminal COINTELPRO to infiltrate my office and set me up and send me to prison!
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.601]  I mean, this little piece of crap needs to be arrested!
[01:28:07.881 --> 01:28:10.321]  Not in the White House, running all federal laws!
[01:28:12.241 --> 01:28:12.821]  Well, you're right.
[01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:15.342]  But how do we bring that about?
[01:28:17.522 --> 01:28:18.822]  I just can't look at his picture.
[01:28:19.203 --> 01:28:21.603]  I just can't look at it.
[01:28:21.643 --> 01:28:24.523]  We can try to get the right people in Congress.
[01:28:24.563 --> 01:28:25.484]  Maybe they'll stop it.
[01:28:25.944 --> 01:28:27.764]  It's our only legal avenue.
[01:28:28.539 --> 01:28:30.120]  I mean, they don't care whether they break the law.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:30.881]  They make the law.
[01:28:30.921 --> 01:28:32.502]  They don't care about the Constitution.
[01:28:32.902 --> 01:28:34.243]  They do what they feel like doing.
[01:28:34.763 --> 01:28:39.467]  And that's, you know, what you've said throughout the program is a perfect example of that.
[01:28:40.307 --> 01:28:45.391]  And so we're going to have to try to work through the system, which we are and have been.
[01:28:46.051 --> 01:28:48.733]  And if it doesn't work, well, then we'll have to use something else.
[01:28:50.945 --> 01:29:02.172]  What is the bully psychology of flaunting that they're in charge and they're going to take our rights and openly throwing it out and announcing it and then always denying it separately?
[01:29:02.633 --> 01:29:03.733]  What is the point of that?
[01:29:05.274 --> 01:29:08.216]  Well, it's psychopathic is what it is.
[01:29:09.597 --> 01:29:10.758]  Because they just don't care.
[01:29:15.768 --> 01:29:25.671]  I just landed a free Home of the Brave with a bunch of people saying they're communists who work for offshore banks robbing everything, saying we're bad because we want free speech in the Second Amendment.
[01:29:28.492 --> 01:29:31.694]  And he's going to be our next Supreme Court Justice, probably, unless we stop him.
[01:29:32.094 --> 01:29:33.214]  Bob, let's continue.
[01:29:33.234 --> 01:29:37.556]  You want to play some video clips, audio clips of him, and then get into some other issues with Bob Chapman.
[01:29:37.596 --> 01:29:38.476]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:41.497 --> 01:29:42.417]  We're on the march.
[01:29:42.897 --> 01:29:44.418]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:48.231]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:50.632 --> 01:29:55.814]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:29:55.834 --> 01:29:58.655]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:29:58.695 --> 01:30:02.997]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:30:04.017 --> 01:30:05.398]  Friends, I hope that you will organize

[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:24.483]  A new level in production quality and in information exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[01:30:24.664 --> 01:30:26.224]  This film needs to be seen.

[01:30:51.104 --> 01:30:53.706]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:54.127 --> 01:30:59.091]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:59.452 --> 01:31:01.173]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:01.494 --> 01:31:06.318]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:06.498 --> 01:31:07.459]  How much do you want?
[01:31:07.679 --> 01:31:08.440]  When do you want it?
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:10.402]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:10.702 --> 01:31:11.523]  When will you need it?
[01:31:11.763 --> 01:31:13.825]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:13.965 --> 01:31:15.086]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:15.306 --> 01:31:16.648]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:16.848 --> 01:31:17.108]  If there's
[01:31:17.128 --> 01:31:19.209]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:31:19.369 --> 01:31:21.890]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:22.090 --> 01:31:25.271]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:25.672 --> 01:31:29.173]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:29.493 --> 01:31:30.474]  How much will you need?
[01:31:30.714 --> 01:31:31.334]  We don't know.
[01:31:31.614 --> 01:31:32.535]  How much do you want?
[01:31:32.715 --> 01:31:33.415]  All you can get.
[01:31:33.655 --> 01:31:34.496]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:34.736 --> 01:31:37.520]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:40.423]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:40.643 --> 01:31:41.404]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:50.424 --> 01:31:51.404]  What's your home worth?
[01:31:51.584 --> 01:31:53.525]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:31:53.705 --> 01:31:56.446]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:31:56.746 --> 01:32:04.268]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[01:32:04.448 --> 01:32:07.889]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.
[01:32:08.109 --> 01:32:10.229]  It's so easy and best of all, it's free.

[01:32:48.877 --> 01:33:03.960]  For a month, Chris Matthews, producer, has told me he was coming to Austin to interview me this Sunday.
[01:33:05.336 --> 01:33:06.196]  They just called up.
[01:33:06.296 --> 01:33:07.157]  I just talked to her.
[01:33:07.417 --> 01:33:11.018]  His crew is still coming here, but Chris Matthews has chickened out.
[01:33:12.438 --> 01:33:14.719]  I mean, even with a taped interview, I didn't approach them.
[01:33:14.759 --> 01:33:15.879]  I don't care about being on the show.
[01:33:15.899 --> 01:33:18.720]  I already took it over for an hour in Denver live.
[01:33:21.321 --> 01:33:30.324]  Anytime I want to be on the Chris Matthews Show, I can just go to a major event where he's broadcasting live and just take it over like I did Geraldo Rivera.
[01:33:33.085 --> 01:33:33.365]  Again,
[01:33:35.285 --> 01:33:38.646]  Then they tried to bait and switch and say, oh, well, now he's going to come to Houston.
[01:33:38.667 --> 01:33:39.507]  Will you come to Houston?
[01:33:39.527 --> 01:33:40.167]  I said, no.
[01:33:41.348 --> 01:33:42.048]  You want to come here?
[01:33:42.088 --> 01:33:42.648]  That's fine.
[01:33:43.289 --> 01:33:47.811]  And then, oh, they called just now and said they're not going to be able to come.
[01:33:47.851 --> 01:33:49.031]  But is it all right if they come?
[01:33:49.851 --> 01:33:52.152]  And then I'm sure that'll be canceled, too, which is great.
[01:33:52.172 --> 01:33:52.993]  I don't want to be around them.
[01:33:54.656 --> 01:33:57.518]  But it just shows how the establishment doesn't know how to deal with me.
[01:33:58.018 --> 01:34:05.381]  Because they know, no matter how they mischaracterize us, how they take us out of context, how they spin us, no matter what they do, I like hit pieces.
[01:34:06.182 --> 01:34:09.703]  Because people then actually come and find out what we're doing and how we document everything.
[01:34:09.984 --> 01:34:20.789]  Speaking of documenting, we're going to read some quotes and also play some clips of one of the top White House czars over the implementation of all law through the executive and get Bob Chapman's take on that.
[01:34:21.349 --> 01:34:22.850]  I did want to just briefly tell you
[01:34:24.062 --> 01:34:27.004]  We get sent new videos and books almost every day.
[01:34:27.044 --> 01:34:31.346]  In fact, now it's sometimes multiple times a day, and I turn down the vast majority of them.
[01:34:32.767 --> 01:34:40.691]  It's got to be well-produced, cover a lot of facets, and be really informative before we sell it on the InfoWars.com video bookstore.
[01:34:42.372 --> 01:34:45.694]  Well, I got a video that I'm not just proud to carry, I'm really excited about.
[01:34:46.354 --> 01:34:51.037]  It's got Daniel Estelin, it's got G. Edward Griffin, it's got
[01:34:52.947 --> 01:34:54.789]  Catherine Albrecht in it and so many others.
[01:34:55.289 --> 01:34:59.393]  It's called Shadow Government, how the global elite plan to destroy democracy and your freedom.
[01:35:01.181 --> 01:35:09.464]  And it breaks down the total control grid and it does it from a great perspective to really wake people up.
[01:35:09.724 --> 01:35:12.745]  So I hope people will order Shadow Government today.
[01:35:12.765 --> 01:35:19.568]  And it's got a little bit of a Christian perspective in it, so it's really good for churches and groups like that as well.
[01:35:20.048 --> 01:35:23.089]  So again, it's Shadow Government.
[01:35:23.709 --> 01:35:24.969]  You can get it for, what is it, $18?
[01:35:25.710 --> 01:35:28.271]  17-something at Infowars.com.
[01:35:28.671 --> 01:35:29.231]  Discounted.
[01:35:29.771 --> 01:35:32.372]  And get Fall of the Republic for $9.95 half price.
[01:35:32.852 --> 01:35:37.394]  Or get a t-shirt for $5.95 when you get it with Shadow Government.
[01:35:37.414 --> 01:35:39.054]  Some of our best-selling t-shirts.
[01:35:39.314 --> 01:35:41.455]  We're almost out of the Obama Joker shirts.
[01:35:41.475 --> 01:35:43.196]  When they're done, we're not going to sell those anymore.
[01:35:43.556 --> 01:35:44.596]  That's one of our best sellers.
[01:35:44.656 --> 01:35:45.516]  It's a limited edition.
[01:35:45.556 --> 01:35:47.037]  There's still some sizes of that left.
[01:35:47.557 --> 01:35:56.161]  You can check it at InfoWars.com, but we've got a bunch of other t-shirts in all sizes for you, so you can still get the t-shirt for $5.95 when you get it with the films and a bunch of other discounts.
[01:35:56.781 --> 01:36:05.044]  Also, today is the last day, but we're so limited on staff, it'll probably run through the weekend, and then there'll be new banners up and new specials Monday.
[01:36:05.304 --> 01:36:10.367]  We may even change it tomorrow, but the point is, you can get five months free until we take it down this weekend.
[01:36:10.747 --> 01:36:12.988]  We do it every year, part of December, part of January.
[01:36:13.928 --> 01:36:16.170]  Five and a half months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:16.210 --> 01:36:28.002]  We simulcast the radio show in living color, full production, video, document cams, adds a whole new dimension, archives of that show, better audio archives, video archives, all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book.
[01:36:28.683 --> 01:36:30.805]  In April it'll be six years of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:32.722 --> 01:36:35.485]  It's got to be 10,000 or more pieces of audio and video.
[01:36:36.445 --> 01:36:45.193]  You can download it, burn it to disk, give it to your friends and family, and a library, an armory of resistance and info war on every subject you can imagine, every permutation of info.
[01:36:45.934 --> 01:36:47.395]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:47.435 --> 01:36:50.858]  You can also call toll free to get Shadow Government or the other films, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:36:50.878 --> 01:36:52.200]  Okay, going back to Bob Chapman.
[01:36:59.486 --> 01:37:07.172]  I've been ranting over Obama's favorite for Supreme Court Justice, Sunstein, openly says ban guns, openly says ban free speech.
[01:37:07.833 --> 01:37:14.158]  How arrogant are they saying he's the guy they're going to tap when Ruth Bader Ginsburg leaves?
[01:37:15.659 --> 01:37:26.027]  Again, I mean, they think, I guess it's that mainstream that they know they're tyrants, they know the Congress are tyrants, and that they think they can get him through despite this.
[01:37:26.067 --> 01:37:26.928]  What does that say about them?
[01:37:29.392 --> 01:37:35.717]  It says that they think that, although they want us to think, they're in total control and that we can't do anything about it.
[01:37:37.158 --> 01:37:38.519]  And I get news for them.
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:42.322]  They're not in total control and we can do something about it.
[01:37:43.243 --> 01:37:51.509]  And besides, the minute we stop trying to keep our freedom, we may as well just go and join them and live on our knees as slaves.
[01:37:53.070 --> 01:37:56.313]  And so I believe that this is a move
[01:37:57.530 --> 01:38:05.576]  Uh, out of desperation as well, uh, to come out and say these sort of things and come out and say that they're, they want this man to be on the Supreme Court.
[01:38:06.757 --> 01:38:10.180]  And, but, you know, they're being forced to do that.
[01:38:11.181 --> 01:38:14.603]  I mean, we've met him at the pass and they're fighting and we're winning.
[01:38:15.304 --> 01:38:16.565]  This is the first time ever.
[01:38:16.625 --> 01:38:20.508]  I mean, they've had everything to themselves for years and years and years.
[01:38:22.535 --> 01:38:25.456]  And so I think we've got to keep on doing what we're doing.
[01:38:25.496 --> 01:38:27.476]  I mean, it's no wonder they're upset.
[01:38:28.016 --> 01:38:40.680]  I mean, the things that you just said about the product that you have out there to tell people, you know, what's going on and how to understand it and what the facts are, it's killing them.
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:44.361]  I mean, what you've done is enormous.
[01:38:45.321 --> 01:38:46.021]  Well, it's what we've all done.
[01:38:46.041 --> 01:38:50.082]  I mean, everybody else that's helped who's involved too, but they haven't had the impact that you have.
[01:38:52.625 --> 01:39:03.216]  Well, when Obama Deception's been seen more than 30 million times for free online, 4 million for Fall of the Republic, and all my films, everything, it just continues.
[01:39:03.716 --> 01:39:10.804]  We are literally reaching hundreds of millions of people every 4 or 5 months or so, in one way or another, in media.
[01:39:11.204 --> 01:39:13.727]  And the hundreds of interviews I do, the thousands you do, Bob.
[01:39:14.127 --> 01:39:21.314]  And there's hundreds of us that are prominent, that know what we're talking about, that don't get caught up in the COINTELPRO, who don't get caught up in the infighting.
[01:39:21.614 --> 01:39:23.196]  Briefly dealing with COINTELPRO.
[01:39:23.216 --> 01:39:25.198]  For those that don't know, that's this infighting mechanism.
[01:39:25.818 --> 01:39:27.960]  Tell people how you can spot COINTELPRO.
[01:39:28.101 --> 01:39:31.964]  Obviously, all these fake Patriot sites that all they do is attack other people.
[01:39:32.745 --> 01:39:34.307]  It's come out they're COINTELPRO.
[01:39:34.407 --> 01:39:37.531]  Hal Turner, the top Nazi, COINTELPRO.
[01:39:37.571 --> 01:39:39.653]  Now it comes out he's an FBI agent in federal court.
[01:39:40.474 --> 01:39:42.136]  Oklahoma City, COINTELPRO.
[01:39:42.756 --> 01:39:46.180]  I mean, they've got to cast us as the bad guys somehow.
[01:39:46.641 --> 01:39:48.403]  And he says in these reports he wrote,
[01:39:48.823 --> 01:39:54.147]  Sunstein says we have to attack them as conspiracy theorists because no one believes us anymore.
[01:39:54.387 --> 01:39:55.448]  So it's kind of schizophrenic.
[01:39:55.468 --> 01:39:58.691]  He says, oh, we're all powerful, but man, these people are hurting us.
[01:39:59.191 --> 01:40:07.418]  We've got to pose as them to somehow try to get everybody fighting with each other, just like they did in the 60s to groups and the 70s and 80s to conservatives.
[01:40:07.678 --> 01:40:12.201]  But this isn't working anymore, namely because too many people are standing up and speaking out.
[01:40:12.561 --> 01:40:14.943]  They don't have the personnel to get it done, Bob Chapman.
[01:40:16.124 --> 01:40:16.925]  You're absolutely right.
[01:40:17.751 --> 01:40:37.178]  And with this COINTELPROGRAM, you can usually spot these people pretty easily because, you know, they won't be around for very long and they'll be telling you, don't you think we should go over there and attack the police barracks and shoot everybody in there?
[01:40:37.198 --> 01:40:39.779]  I mean, this is the kind of things that they come up with.
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:43.160]  And you have to be awful dumb to get sucked in on them.
[01:40:43.441 --> 01:40:44.481]  They'll try anyway.
[01:40:45.191 --> 01:40:47.054]  But those people are already out there.
[01:40:47.094 --> 01:40:48.756]  The government already has them out there.
[01:40:49.136 --> 01:40:50.578]  They've had them out there for years.
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:59.470]  I mean, one time I came back into the country and they were waiting at the airport for me.
[01:40:59.490 --> 01:41:03.295]  I mean, you know, they don't give up either, but they don't have the personnel.
[01:41:04.545 --> 01:41:06.046]  To reach the people like we do.
[01:41:06.486 --> 01:41:17.071]  Nobody, well let me put it this way, there's a lot of people who do not believe anything that they hear on the regular AM FM radio or on television.
[01:41:17.271 --> 01:41:18.332]  And those numbers are growing.
[01:41:19.412 --> 01:41:22.354]  And they're all gravitating toward what we're talking about.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:27.444]  I mean, I get more letters from people saying, gee, it's so nice to have somebody tell the truth.
[01:41:27.844 --> 01:41:28.965]  But that's what he says.
[01:41:29.045 --> 01:41:31.368]  He says they're not just trying to set us up.
[01:41:31.388 --> 01:41:39.035]  He says they want to do that, go into peaceful groups and run off everybody by talking about violence and then imprison those you can, which is calling for crimes.
[01:41:39.415 --> 01:41:46.141]  He says that they poses us to mix in disinfo and to get us all fighting with each other.
[01:41:47.422 --> 01:41:53.964]  He's saying the government, which we have articles here, where CENTCOM admits it, the military's doing it, it was going on under Bush.
[01:41:54.004 --> 01:41:56.604]  It isn't just the liberal variant, which isn't even liberal.
[01:41:56.724 --> 01:41:57.805]  These are just criminals.
[01:41:58.905 --> 01:42:03.766]  But I mean, he's openly announcing that they're committing crimes.
[01:42:04.026 --> 01:42:08.187]  I guess he wants to just set the precedent and just act like it's normal to do this.
[01:42:09.568 --> 01:42:11.068]  Well, you know what they have done?
[01:42:11.943 --> 01:42:16.044]  And I've noticed this quite distinctly over the last ten years.
[01:42:16.304 --> 01:42:25.767]  Up until that time, the people who were listening to me and what I had to say about the different subjects that I discussed, they were pretty conservative people.
[01:42:26.427 --> 01:42:32.629]  And in the last ten years, half of my subscribership is conservative.
[01:42:32.929 --> 01:42:39.211]  The other half are ex-liberals, Marxists, Leninists, I mean people
[01:42:39.821 --> 01:42:41.862]  That have all come into the middle together.
[01:42:42.362 --> 01:42:45.903]  And this has to be just sending them up a tree.
[01:42:46.443 --> 01:42:47.924]  Because they don't know what to do about it.
[01:42:50.325 --> 01:42:57.547]  That's my next issue, is that reading the Village Voice, Raw Story, literally scores in the last three or four days on this guy.
[01:42:58.087 --> 01:43:07.130]  It was the liberals, the real liberals, and I don't agree with their ideology given to them by the banks, but the next step is for them to wake up to collectivism being a fraud, and they're starting to do that.
[01:43:07.671 --> 01:43:08.511]  Every comment
[01:43:09.111 --> 01:43:17.997]  Every comment on Raw Story, which is huge, on the article said, he's a fascist, just as bad as Bush, they all work for the banks, it's global government, it's a new world order.
[01:43:18.298 --> 01:43:19.979]  My God, Alex Jones is right.
[01:43:20.019 --> 01:43:21.400]  I mean, literally, they're in there saying that.
[01:43:22.481 --> 01:43:29.726]  Alternet, all these sites, even though they're run by Soros, a lot of them, their own people are bolting from the reservation.
[01:43:30.186 --> 01:43:33.028]  Going, oh my God, it's all true, New World Order.
[01:43:33.048 --> 01:43:36.731]  I mean, I think it's sabotaging themselves.
[01:43:37.071 --> 01:43:39.753]  I want this scumbag to continue saying what he's saying.
[01:43:41.835 --> 01:43:43.616]  Well, he's certainly waking people up.
[01:43:44.257 --> 01:43:48.139]  People who are on the edge, people who said, gee, I don't have time for this.
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:52.202]  My wife and I are working two jobs each and we can hardly get to see the kids.
[01:43:52.703 --> 01:43:55.765]  You know, we rush into the house, make dinner, eat and go to sleep.
[01:43:56.506 --> 01:43:58.167]  And all of a sudden they're going to say, gee,
[01:43:58.655 --> 01:44:06.163]  These people are coming out and they're saying, if I disagree with anything they have to say, they're going to put me away.
[01:44:06.183 --> 01:44:08.205]  That's not right.
[01:44:08.286 --> 01:44:10.047]  I mean, they've gone too far.
[01:44:10.628 --> 01:44:14.112]  And so this is opening the minds of people even further.
[01:44:15.069 --> 01:44:19.691]  Again, desperate people do desperate things, and that's what they've done.
[01:44:20.411 --> 01:44:24.912]  But Bob, isn't it also that they've misjudged a lot of the public?
[01:44:24.952 --> 01:44:27.733]  I mean, part of the public are a bunch of cowards, 25% or so.
[01:44:28.333 --> 01:44:34.095]  And so, by saying you're not allowed to question the government, you're not allowed to question global warming, or we will arrest you.
[01:44:34.455 --> 01:44:36.396]  I saw that five years ago in the British news.
[01:44:36.756 --> 01:44:39.497]  Last year they called for arresting Lord Monckton for treason.
[01:44:40.397 --> 01:45:05.930]  uh... and and and said execute him the liberals now want to kill people you know they're only against the death penalty when it's for themselves but they want to kill us now they're saying it here and i think they're making the calculation they are the mommy they are the daddy they will tell you what you're allowed to talk about and then all the yuppies and everybody will hear them say they're not allowed to question and so they're taking political correctness it's like uh...
[01:45:06.690 --> 01:45:12.652]  Chris Matthews over and over again saying, if you question government health care, you are a racist.
[01:45:12.672 --> 01:45:13.192]  That's a quote.
[01:45:13.832 --> 01:45:15.412]  And no one was talking about race.
[01:45:15.452 --> 01:45:20.134]  They just injected through COINTELPRO to create more divide and conquer.
[01:45:20.394 --> 01:45:22.214]  And that blew up in their face.
[01:45:24.255 --> 01:45:25.915]  But they really think they're God.
[01:45:25.995 --> 01:45:28.556]  They certainly do.
[01:45:28.576 --> 01:45:30.356]  Just read the Foreign Affairs.
[01:45:30.416 --> 01:45:31.417]  I've got a subscriber since 1960.
[01:45:33.511 --> 01:45:36.852]  And when I wasn't a subscriber, I bought it off the newsstand.
[01:45:37.572 --> 01:45:40.093]  And it's all there.
[01:45:40.153 --> 01:45:41.433]  They can't keep their mouth shut.
[01:45:42.514 --> 01:45:43.594]  It's as simple as that.
[01:45:43.614 --> 01:45:47.315]  It's pretty easy to run down their ego.
[01:45:47.995 --> 01:45:48.975]  Look at Wall Street.
[01:45:50.276 --> 01:45:58.278]  Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, tells us he's doing God's work by stealing our money.
[01:46:00.428 --> 01:46:04.932]  And then we had the TSA guy last week in L.A.
[01:46:05.152 --> 01:46:07.935]  go crazy and start saying, I am God, I am in charge.
[01:46:09.597 --> 01:46:13.160]  Well, that's to be expected from people like that.
[01:46:14.241 --> 01:46:16.123]  I mean, look at people go through at the airport.
[01:46:16.143 --> 01:46:16.984]  I won't even travel.
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:21.503]  Well, that's another issue.
[01:46:21.543 --> 01:46:24.948]  The naked body scanners are now going into courthouses nationwide.
[01:46:25.248 --> 01:46:29.654]  They summon you, force you to come, and then record your naked body and put it in a database.
[01:46:31.677 --> 01:46:32.178]  That's right.
[01:46:33.399 --> 01:46:35.883]  And it's only the beginning as they damage your DNA.
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:45.825]  Well, remember the Running Man in 1984, where Schwarzenegger's going around and billboards are announcing, report a family member, get a double credit, cadre kids?
[01:46:46.425 --> 01:46:54.429]  They now are putting up billboards in New York and they're saying nationwide rollout, jumbo screens, with the FBI giving you anti-terror messages.
[01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:56.950]  We are literally worse than North Korea now.
[01:46:58.871 --> 01:47:04.374]  Well, I'll go along with that, and I think most of the people who are listening will as well.
[01:47:05.414 --> 01:47:07.475]  Otherwise, they wouldn't be listening to this program.
[01:47:08.695 --> 01:47:09.756]  It's up to you out there.
[01:47:10.476 --> 01:47:16.178]  You've got to absorb all this, and you've got to tell people what our government's trying to do to us.
[01:47:17.199 --> 01:47:18.839]  We'll get the information out to you.
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:24.662]  Other than just here, InfoWars has got, what did you say, five different pieces on it?
[01:47:25.362 --> 01:47:25.622]  Yes.
[01:47:27.003 --> 01:47:27.983]  Then there you go.
[01:47:28.063 --> 01:47:31.364]  Go to InfoWars, copy them, send them out to everybody.
[01:47:31.625 --> 01:47:32.545]  Everybody you know.
[01:47:33.075 --> 01:47:35.157]  Whether you think they're going to turn you down or not.
[01:47:36.538 --> 01:47:40.821]  You know, you never know until you ask for the order whether you're going to get it.
[01:47:41.161 --> 01:47:48.387]  Well, in this case, you're never going to know about people accepting what you've got to say.
[01:47:48.687 --> 01:47:51.089]  You don't know what's going to pull somebody's chain.
[01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:53.731]  Well, it's not even accepting.
[01:47:53.771 --> 01:47:54.952]  We have the video and audio.
[01:47:54.992 --> 01:47:55.293]  In fact,
[01:47:56.124 --> 01:48:05.187]  Here is a clip of him saying, we're going to ban hunting outright, and the Second Amendment isn't an individual right, and the next three years, look for the judicial system to overturn it.
[01:48:05.467 --> 01:48:12.129]  Here's that clip of the White House Head of Regulatory Affairs, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.
[01:48:12.169 --> 01:48:12.509]  Here it is.
[01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:18.873]  We'll have to ban hunting, I suggest, if there isn't a purpose other than sport and fun.
[01:48:19.193 --> 01:48:20.274]  That should be against the law.
[01:48:20.754 --> 01:48:22.395]  It's time now, sir.
[01:48:22.415 --> 01:48:28.158]  With the previous speakers, I believe that human interests certainly count in the overall balance.
[01:48:29.039 --> 01:48:33.861]  But most of the time, the problem is animal interests are not counted at all.
[01:48:34.382 --> 01:48:35.602]  They have zero weight.
[01:48:37.103 --> 01:48:37.884]  In the long run,
[01:48:39.466 --> 01:48:49.978]  If this is correct, our willingness to subject animals to untestified suffering will be seen, as Bentham and Mill thought, as a form of unconscionable barbarity.
[01:48:50.899 --> 01:48:58.007]  Not the same as, but in many ways morally akin to, slavery and mass extermination of human beings.
[01:49:00.975 --> 01:49:20.584]  My coming view is that the individual right to bear arms reflects the success of an extremely aggressive and resourceful social movement and has much less to do with good standard legal arguments than appears.
[01:49:23.305 --> 01:49:32.529]  We have seen an unbelievable transformation in the culture of the Second Amendment in a short time, as late as the early 1990s.
[01:49:33.329 --> 01:49:43.193]  Consider, for example, that part of the law of the District of Columbia that requires citizens to keep lawfully owned shotguns bound at home by a trigger lock.
[01:49:44.113 --> 01:49:52.398]  Suppose that a citizen objects, as citizens have been objecting, that the trigger lock interferes with his efforts at self-defense against criminals.
[01:49:52.798 --> 01:49:57.761]  What on earth does that have to do with the Second Amendment as originally understood?
[01:49:58.961 --> 01:50:03.544]  My tentative suggestion is that the individual right to have guns
[01:50:04.384 --> 01:50:16.258]  As it's being conceptualized now, it's best taken as a contemporary creation and a reflection of current fears, not a reading of civic-centered founding debates.
[01:50:17.079 --> 01:50:23.145]  Modern gun owners who are invoking the Second Amendment on the basis of a principle they favor are perfectionists.
[01:50:24.006 --> 01:50:36.173]  Not so different from older people who tried, unsuccessfully, I'm pleased to say, to get the Equal Protection Clause read to strike down mandatory retirement laws.
[01:50:37.494 --> 01:50:45.799]  Well, in terms of judicial developments, it is striking and noteworthy that well over two... Stand there, we're going to come back.
[01:50:45.919 --> 01:50:47.159]  This is the key part of the clip.
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:47.920]  Stay with us.
[01:50:50.836 --> 01:50:51.156]  Hello.
[01:50:51.497 --> 01:50:55.901]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[01:50:56.261 --> 01:51:00.665]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[01:51:01.005 --> 01:51:05.809]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[01:51:06.010 --> 01:51:10.894]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf, which left me wondering if I even needed another book.
[01:51:11.174 --> 01:51:12.135]  Boy, was I wrong.
[01:51:12.435 --> 01:51:15.398]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[01:51:15.578 --> 01:51:19.403]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[01:51:19.443 --> 01:51:22.407]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[01:51:22.667 --> 01:51:23.048]  Wow!
[01:51:23.208 --> 01:51:24.449]  I watched the DVD last night.
[01:51:24.730 --> 01:51:25.831]  I was awestruck.
[01:51:25.951 --> 01:51:27.453]  What wonderful work you have done.
[01:51:27.633 --> 01:51:29.836]  This information can bless many people.
[01:51:30.176 --> 01:51:30.657]  Thank you.
[01:51:31.197 --> 01:51:31.918]  Thanks again.
[01:51:32.118 --> 01:51:35.000]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:35.620]  Thank you.
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:38.842]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:55.645]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:51:56.026 --> 01:51:59.010]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:51:59.251 --> 01:52:00.673]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:52:01.371 --> 01:52:04.052]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:04.812 --> 01:52:10.294]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:10.454 --> 01:52:15.476]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:15.976 --> 01:52:25.620]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:27.841]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:28.081 --> 01:52:29.401]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:29.661 --> 01:52:31.962]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:32.122 --> 01:52:33.963]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:33.983 --> 01:52:39.065]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:52:39.405 --> 01:52:44.167]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:52:50.393 --> 01:52:53.575]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:52:53.935 --> 01:52:55.776]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:52:56.236 --> 01:52:56.656]  Don't!
[01:52:57.096 --> 01:53:00.118]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[01:53:24.207 --> 01:53:25.188]  Herb K was right.

[01:53:38.512 --> 01:53:38.552]  888-352-7726.
[01:53:53.655 --> 01:53:55.296]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:53:55.316 --> 01:53:55.976]  to 3 p.m.
[01:53:55.996 --> 01:53:56.337]  Central.
[01:53:56.357 --> 01:53:57.657]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[01:53:57.717 --> 01:53:58.078]  Eastern.
[01:53:58.598 --> 01:53:59.538]  We're here live.
[01:54:00.239 --> 01:54:03.441]  We're just normal people that want the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:54:03.481 --> 01:54:04.121]  We studied it.
[01:54:04.882 --> 01:54:13.206]  We have offshore banks robbing us, looting us, setting up Northcom, militarizing police so they can get away with robbing us.
[01:54:14.427 --> 01:54:15.428]  They think they're God.
[01:54:15.448 --> 01:54:17.629]  They hate the general public.
[01:54:17.649 --> 01:54:19.310]  They want to reduce the world population.
[01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:25.063]  And they've got so many yuppies and mainline people thinking they're part of the system and part of the power structure.
[01:54:25.083 --> 01:54:25.563]  You're not.
[01:54:26.544 --> 01:54:28.605]  And police and military are really waking up.
[01:54:28.625 --> 01:54:29.846]  The general public's waking up.
[01:54:30.406 --> 01:54:32.127]  Everybody needs to speak out and stand up.
[01:54:32.147 --> 01:54:33.708]  We're gonna open the phones up in the next hour.
[01:54:33.728 --> 01:54:33.788]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:34.268 --> 01:54:37.510]  And Bob, I've been trying to talk to you during the break, but you were away.
[01:54:41.753 --> 01:54:46.238]  If you'd like to ride shotgun 20 minutes to the next hour, if you can't, got something else to do, that's fine.
[01:54:46.618 --> 01:54:47.960]  I want to get into Bankstergate.
[01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:49.902]  You were talking about it last week with us.
[01:54:49.942 --> 01:54:50.943]  It's now big news.
[01:54:51.344 --> 01:54:53.266]  Timmy Geithner and the crimes he's committed.
[01:54:53.366 --> 01:54:56.469]  Open discussion of him being indicted or having to step down.
[01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:58.251]  No, he's just a bag man.
[01:54:58.291 --> 01:54:59.072]  Needs to go further.
[01:54:59.392 --> 01:55:00.313]  Bob, can you stay with us?
[01:55:01.244 --> 01:55:01.865]  Absolutely.
[01:55:02.426 --> 01:55:11.137]  Okay, anything else on the Obama's favorite for Supreme Court Justice Sunstein wants to ban guns and free speech?
[01:55:11.197 --> 01:55:13.320]  I want to finish that clip, just the gun part.
[01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:14.181]  I forgot to play that.
[01:55:15.723 --> 01:55:16.724]  Anything else on this guy?
[01:55:18.467 --> 01:55:18.947]  Not really.
[01:55:19.408 --> 01:55:19.988]  Just go ahead.
[01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:22.350]  Guys, do you have that gun part queued up again?
[01:55:23.070 --> 01:55:23.871]  The very last part?
[01:55:24.131 --> 01:55:43.265]  Just play the 30-second clip, just the isolated clip of him, where he specifically says, after he says the Second Amendment, you heard the part of the clip, you know, isn't really for individuals and it's a new idea, that's that same party line they got caught publishing that fake book that was a lie five years ago, and they, and they, they, the professor lost his tenure, also from Chicago, that said it.
[01:55:43.585 --> 01:55:44.606]  We exposed that fraud.
[01:55:45.226 --> 01:55:46.127]  Professor Lott did.
[01:55:47.708 --> 01:55:50.950]  Then he goes on to say, look for it to be overturned in the next three years.
[01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:52.471]  Here he is.
[01:55:52.531 --> 01:56:07.380]  In terms of judicial developments, it is striking and noteworthy that well over two centuries since the founding, the Supreme Court has never suggested that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to have guns.
[01:56:07.620 --> 01:56:08.081]  Not once.
[01:56:09.710 --> 01:56:21.422]  It would be amazing, though, given that fact, though, don't be surprised if the first time it happens is in the next three or four years.
[01:56:24.545 --> 01:56:29.571]  So, this guy is saying you have no right to keep him in your arms.
[01:56:31.591 --> 01:56:37.597]  Bob, there weren't rulings against the Second Amendment until 1933, and that's when they first restricted it.
[01:56:37.657 --> 01:56:39.318]  It's been a universally understood right.
[01:56:39.739 --> 01:56:44.943]  No laws over, just like no laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting it for exercise thereof.
[01:56:45.224 --> 01:56:47.846]  The federal government has no jurisdiction, neither do the states.
[01:56:48.186 --> 01:56:51.209]  That's one of the few things that the Constitution says the states don't have, even.
[01:56:51.870 --> 01:56:53.772]  And under the Tenth Amendment, it's reserved to them.
[01:56:54.412 --> 01:56:58.134]  And now, look, the churches under 501c3 are completely government run.
[01:56:58.434 --> 01:57:00.675]  I mean, this guy has a constitutional lawyer.
[01:57:00.715 --> 01:57:01.756]  He knows he's a liar.
[01:57:06.278 --> 01:57:18.944]  You know, one of the things that I catch in his speaking about all this, he doesn't come on to me as being particularly intelligent.
[01:57:19.485 --> 01:57:22.166]  And he seems very tentative about what he's saying.
[01:57:23.044 --> 01:57:28.929]  And that would bear out what you're saying in the fact that he knows that he's lying.
[01:57:29.629 --> 01:57:30.690]  Well, he's a Nelly, too.
[01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:33.512]  I mean, why are these guys always a bunch of Nellies?
[01:57:36.655 --> 01:57:37.175]  Well, it's not.
[01:57:37.255 --> 01:57:40.618]  I mean, the point is, we're ruled by a bunch of Nellies.
[01:57:40.938 --> 01:57:43.040]  When are men going to stand up against this, Bob?
[01:57:44.701 --> 01:57:46.082]  Well, we'll get there.
[01:57:46.522 --> 01:57:48.384]  We've just got to keep on doing what we're doing.
[01:57:48.846 --> 01:57:54.168]  And the audience has got to keep on doing what they should be doing and informing everybody that they can.
[01:57:54.748 --> 01:57:59.409]  And then we can stop these people and we start by getting Congress dismissed.
[01:58:00.089 --> 01:58:09.332]  And we get new people in there and say, look, we don't want you getting paid off by the pharmaceutical companies and the banks and the insurance and Wall Street who really run our country.
[01:58:10.172 --> 01:58:11.412]  We don't want that anymore.
[01:58:11.913 --> 01:58:15.534]  And we don't want you to go up there and do what we don't want you to do.
[01:58:15.574 --> 01:58:16.234]  We want you to
[01:58:17.549 --> 01:58:19.230]  Represent us, not those people.
[01:58:19.570 --> 01:58:21.191]  And they're saying, talk to the hand.
[01:58:21.251 --> 01:58:22.271]  Talk to NorthCom.
[01:58:22.531 --> 01:58:23.772]  We're outlawing your speech.
[01:58:24.152 --> 01:58:24.952]  We own you now.
[01:58:25.272 --> 01:58:29.974]  Back in one minute, let's get into the healthcare takeover, BankerGate and a lot more.

[01:59:45.931 --> 01:59:48.632]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:57.071 --> 02:00:03.394]  If you think all this is bad, I'm going to tell you about Intelpedia coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:04.935 --> 02:00:09.557]  How that dovetails with Google helping build the architecture of censorship.
[02:00:09.577 --> 02:00:11.238]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[02:00:11.778 --> 02:00:15.280]  We're going to open the phones up as well coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:15.360]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:17.121]  We will get you up and on the air today.
[02:00:25.495 --> 02:00:26.796]  Going back to Bob Chapman.
[02:00:28.637 --> 02:00:31.979]  Bob, shifting gears into the economy, you are one of our leading experts.
[02:00:31.999 --> 02:00:36.302]  You have one of the most accurate forecasts, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:00:36.722 --> 02:00:38.143]  Year after year, you've been right.
[02:00:39.384 --> 02:00:41.465]  I want to get into the government health care.
[02:00:41.485 --> 02:00:44.908]  I mean, I've looked at both House and Senate versions.
[02:00:44.928 --> 02:00:45.648]  They're both horrible.
[02:00:46.128 --> 02:00:47.969]  The, of course, conference version is secret.
[02:00:48.010 --> 02:00:49.430]  They've been doing that behind closed doors.
[02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:50.891]  Obama breaking his promise on that.
[02:00:51.972 --> 02:00:53.193]  We've got all this happening.
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:57.880]  This has really enraged the left.
[02:00:58.020 --> 02:01:00.441]  They found out they're not getting to rob the rich people.
[02:01:00.501 --> 02:01:02.961]  No, the rich people wrote this as a big scam.
[02:01:03.001 --> 02:01:03.561]  Bob Chapman?
[02:01:05.722 --> 02:01:10.082]  Well, I think, first of all, the control factor.
[02:01:11.303 --> 02:01:15.844]  Having national health care, socialized health care, controls the person.
[02:01:17.164 --> 02:01:23.825]  It controls the modalities which you'll be treated with and whether you'll be allowed to live.
[02:01:24.517 --> 02:01:32.262]  So, government has control over your life, and if they deem that your life should be eliminated, they can do that.
[02:01:33.683 --> 02:01:47.512]  The second point, I think, which is very, very strong as well, is that there are 50 million people who don't have any insurance presently, and it would be mandatory for them to have that.
[02:01:48.292 --> 02:01:49.813]  And that's the insurance companies.
[02:01:50.574 --> 02:01:52.715]  They're making all these noises and grumbling,
[02:01:53.576 --> 02:01:54.877]  Uh, over some other points.
[02:01:55.477 --> 02:02:00.260]  But, they want this thing because they want those 50 million participants.
[02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:15.608]  And so, that's a very, very strong, uh, reason why, uh, this healthcare thing is a live or die for the administration, but it's also going to prove to be extremely profitable for insurance companies.
[02:02:15.788 --> 02:02:21.952]  And it's fascism because you've got corporations going to the government and making it the law you've got to buy their services.
[02:02:22.984 --> 02:02:23.424]  That's right.
[02:02:24.125 --> 02:02:27.447]  And it cuts Medicare and Medicaid to the actual general public.
[02:02:28.848 --> 02:02:34.933]  Never mind the fact that there's going to be many, many health professionals who are going to say, no, I'm not going to do this.
[02:02:36.005 --> 02:02:40.868]  Especially people in their 50s and 60s and 70s who are working and practicing.
[02:02:41.248 --> 02:02:42.829]  And this has been a big wake-up call.
[02:02:42.849 --> 02:02:49.153]  You've got 18 Attorney Generals saying they're going to sue because it's selectively certain states don't have to do it.
[02:02:49.794 --> 02:02:54.657]  Labor unions don't get their nice health plans taxed like everybody else does.
[02:02:54.937 --> 02:02:56.718]  I mean this is completely discriminatory.
[02:02:58.139 --> 02:03:04.143]  It is and the thing is how long will it take us to get it through the courts because they do control the courts.
[02:03:04.770 --> 02:03:06.692]  And then what kind of a decision are we going to get?
[02:03:06.712 --> 02:03:09.574]  The same one we're going to get from the Sunstein?
[02:03:11.055 --> 02:03:19.122]  You know, the control that they're trying to put over us could happen.
[02:03:20.083 --> 02:03:30.752]  And if it happens, it's just going to push people further to the edge because the economy is not responding and can't responding because it's so thoroughly corrupt.
[02:03:31.553 --> 02:03:32.934]  I mean, you see these people being
[02:03:33.856 --> 02:03:36.878]  Uh, and we'll call it interrogated by Congress.
[02:03:37.719 --> 02:03:38.379]  They're arrogant.
[02:03:38.399 --> 02:03:39.279]  They don't care.
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:48.325]  I mean, we've got companies out there, uh, like, uh, there's three major companies, uh, in the brokerage business.
[02:03:49.345 --> 02:04:02.013]  And, uh, they've made, um, uh, $200 billion, which they're going to pay out, uh, to their employees, the top ones, of course.
[02:04:03.172 --> 02:04:07.253]  And that was done in part with taxpayer financing.
[02:04:08.213 --> 02:04:12.554]  And then there are $80 billion in tax deductions.
[02:04:13.914 --> 02:04:17.415]  $20 billion of that goes to just three firms.
[02:04:18.575 --> 02:04:21.876]  And that is Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley.
[02:04:23.976 --> 02:04:25.737]  The three biggest in the country.
[02:04:27.357 --> 02:04:32.178]  And nobody talks about all of the offshore businesses that they have.
[02:04:32.935 --> 02:04:34.657]  Well, they don't pay any taxes at all.
[02:04:35.077 --> 02:04:40.262]  I mean, this is true looting of the entire American public.
[02:04:40.703 --> 02:04:42.164]  Let's talk about BanksterGate.
[02:04:42.504 --> 02:04:45.928]  Talk about Google and systematic censorship worldwide.
[02:04:46.248 --> 02:04:47.829]  Your phone calls and a lot more.
[02:04:48.130 --> 02:04:49.911]  And what's happening with gold with Bob Chetton.
[02:04:50.252 --> 02:04:54.496]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:04:54.816 --> 02:04:55.397]  Number one.
[02:04:55.697 --> 02:04:59.700]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:04:59.980 --> 02:05:04.544]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:04.884 --> 02:05:05.344]  It's true.
[02:05:05.625 --> 02:05:10.168]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:11.309 --> 02:05:14.591]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:14.891 --> 02:05:19.374]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:19.614 --> 02:05:21.975]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:22.375 --> 02:05:25.697]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:26.838 --> 02:05:30.742]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:30.982 --> 02:05:35.747]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:36.027 --> 02:05:40.071]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:40.211 --> 02:05:41.772]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:41.992 --> 02:05:46.597]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.609 --> 02:05:53.231]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:53.631 --> 02:05:58.594]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:58.954 --> 02:06:00.695]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:00.995 --> 02:06:05.818]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:05.999 --> 02:06:06.959]  How much do you want?
[02:06:07.179 --> 02:06:07.940]  When do you want it?
[02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:09.921]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:10.201 --> 02:06:11.022]  When will you need it?
[02:06:11.282 --> 02:06:13.343]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:13.483 --> 02:06:14.584]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:14.824 --> 02:06:16.125]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:16.345 --> 02:06:21.410]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:21.590 --> 02:06:24.793]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:25.193 --> 02:06:28.676]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:28.996 --> 02:06:29.997]  How much will you need?
[02:06:30.238 --> 02:06:30.838]  We don't know.
[02:06:31.138 --> 02:06:32.039]  How much do you want?
[02:06:32.239 --> 02:06:32.980]  All you can get.
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:34.001]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:34.261 --> 02:06:37.022]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[02:06:40.423 --> 02:06:40.943]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:40.983 --> 02:06:41.983]  Afraid to answer it?
[02:06:42.023 --> 02:06:42.523]  Afraid to answer
[02:07:07.824 --> 02:07:08.707]  You get out of debt.
[02:07:08.868 --> 02:07:10.615]  They are expensive payment plans.

[02:07:50.821 --> 02:07:55.886]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:56.226 --> 02:07:58.528]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:09.875 --> 02:08:15.480]  Okay, I want to go to Taylor, John, Joel, Julio, Jonathan, and others that are patiently holding, but I wanted to hit this.
[02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:22.367]  I mentioned it earlier in the week, but now we've had time for it to flesh out, for it to kind of unfold.
[02:08:23.564 --> 02:08:39.188]  Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, publicly and openly in the last 15 years, designed, well Google's been around only 10, but the others before that, designed the censorship systems now being used in Australia, in China, in Libya, and other places.
[02:08:39.228 --> 02:08:42.929]  They sell the packages to the government and they run it.
[02:08:45.289 --> 02:08:47.950]  And I would tell people this and they'd say, oh that's a conspiracy theory.
[02:08:47.970 --> 02:08:52.071]  Well, I mean, here's London Guardian, Google to end censorship in China.
[02:08:52.151 --> 02:08:52.671]  Oh, end it?
[02:08:53.777 --> 02:08:54.797]  Over cyber attacks.
[02:08:54.857 --> 02:08:59.918]  Decision from world's leading search engine comes amid a clampdown on internet in China over the last year.
[02:09:01.498 --> 02:09:08.199]  And then it goes into how the Chinese government hacked Google to find out if they were truly censoring everything in their agreement.
[02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:10.160]  Then we have another headline here.
[02:09:11.380 --> 02:09:19.181]  AFP, French news agency, US demands China expand cyber attacks, explain cyber attacks in face-to-face talks.
[02:09:20.582 --> 02:09:22.202]  When we have the White House
[02:09:23.587 --> 02:09:30.635]  Cyber security czar last February resigned saying the NSA is taking over all free speech with a plan to censor.
[02:09:31.075 --> 02:09:32.196]  That was in the Washington Post!
[02:09:34.018 --> 02:09:36.801]  And the article said well maybe it's good that they're censoring.
[02:09:38.423 --> 02:09:41.846]  Australia for the last year has announced Chinese style net censorship.
[02:09:41.886 --> 02:09:42.767]  That's their statement.
[02:09:43.108 --> 02:09:44.289]  The government's calling it that.
[02:09:46.294 --> 02:09:51.539]  I want to get Bob Chapman's take on this, but the point is, this grid is already here, they're already trying to implement it piecemeal.
[02:09:51.799 --> 02:09:55.622]  They're building giant NSA bases, one down at San Antonio's completed.
[02:09:56.323 --> 02:10:02.468]  Major newspapers go and try to shoot video of the front gate and the police come and threaten to arrest them in America.
[02:10:04.129 --> 02:10:09.014]  But I wanted to, I saw a comment in the article on InfoWars.com, Obama's favorite
[02:10:09.943 --> 02:10:10.544]  We're good to go.
[02:10:28.701 --> 02:10:44.873]  A highly secure, in fact zoom in on this guys, a highly secure online system where 37,000 US spies and related personnel, what Sunstein's talking about for COINTELPRO, share information and collaborate on their devious errands, like my FBI file.
[02:10:44.953 --> 02:10:47.856]  They won't give it to me, but we've confirmed it's on Intellipedia.
[02:10:48.769 --> 02:10:50.710]  Which, of course, most of it's lies.
[02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:54.972]  We've always known with others, they just make crap up, so when the government reads about you, it's a bunch of lies.
[02:10:55.693 --> 02:10:57.554]  That's where their COINTELPRO starts.
[02:10:57.794 --> 02:10:59.235]  They eat their own droppings.
[02:10:59.315 --> 02:11:01.236]  They believe their own propaganda.
[02:11:02.577 --> 02:11:10.761]  Agencies such as the so-called National Security Agency have also purchased servers using Google-supplied search technology, which processes information gathered by U.S.
[02:11:10.781 --> 02:11:12.162]  spies operating all over the world.
[02:11:12.202 --> 02:11:14.143]  In addition, Google is linked to the U.S.
[02:11:14.183 --> 02:11:17.105]  spy and military systems through its Google Earth software venture.
[02:11:17.625 --> 02:11:29.610]  The technology behind the software was originally developed by Keyhole Inc., a company funded by Q-Tel, and there's links to that, a venture capital firm which is turned openly funded and operated on behalf of the CIA.
[02:11:29.991 --> 02:11:39.375]  The visible technology can automatically examine more than a million discussions and posts on blogs, online forums, and Flickr simultaneously, YouTube, Twitter, Amazon, and so forth.
[02:11:39.935 --> 02:11:40.455]  It goes on.
[02:11:40.495 --> 02:11:47.261]  The technology also scores each online item assigning a positive or negative of mixed or neutral status.
[02:11:47.321 --> 02:11:54.746]  Kind of like in V for Vendetta when they're driving by listening to conversations and they're going, the negative mention of the government's up at record levels.
[02:11:54.806 --> 02:11:55.727]  They actually do that.
[02:11:57.208 --> 02:12:04.814]  Based on parameters and terms set by the technology operators, information boiled down can be more effectively scanned and read by human operators.
[02:12:05.274 --> 02:12:08.117]  So they're data mining that and it goes more into QTEL.
[02:12:08.237 --> 02:12:08.377]  Now,
[02:12:09.727 --> 02:12:20.952]  The issue here is that, on record, they're building more than 20 giant NSA bases publicly, and that's only 30% of the news reports of spying.
[02:12:21.012 --> 02:12:27.435]  Most of it's private, which is another payoff to the Homeland Security people when they go into private sector, and private sector goes into government.
[02:12:27.915 --> 02:12:31.439]  And then they give themselves contracts for in four years when they get out and make the money.
[02:12:31.459 --> 02:12:32.980]  And it's just mass robbing.
[02:12:33.481 --> 02:12:37.465]  They admit Google is in there at NASA and at CIA.
[02:12:37.505 --> 02:12:41.429]  We first broke this with a high-level CIA officer, Mr. Steele, a few years, four years ago.
[02:12:41.449 --> 02:12:43.271]  I'm gonna get Bob's take on this.
[02:12:43.291 --> 02:12:44.112]  This is so important.
[02:12:45.413 --> 02:12:56.381]  And they're openly building the hubs now under federal law and the Cybersecurity Act to make all IT systems and internet providers go through their hubs to where they can censor the web.
[02:12:56.461 --> 02:13:09.290]  They are putting the Chinese grid in now in front of everyone and then all these White House officials like Sunstein are saying we will censor the web and are developing the systems to do it.
[02:13:09.570 --> 02:13:13.153]  This is a declaration of war against the First Amendment, Bob Chapman.
[02:13:14.389 --> 02:13:17.972]  Well, it certainly is, and quite frankly, it's overwhelming.
[02:13:19.393 --> 02:13:22.176]  And, you know, you talk about your file.
[02:13:22.776 --> 02:13:27.841]  I worked for NSA indirectly, and so they don't have to look very far.
[02:13:28.622 --> 02:13:32.205]  But what they're doing is really overwhelming.
[02:13:32.885 --> 02:13:34.607]  It is war against the people.
[02:13:35.174 --> 02:13:52.997]  Because there's no reason for them to do that except to control people and say, look, we're listening to your conversations and reading your emails and what you're saying is in violation of what Mr. Sunstein says because you don't like a lot of things the government does.
[02:13:53.617 --> 02:14:02.419]  So we've decided to come and send you through an internment camp where you will be re-educated
[02:14:03.126 --> 02:14:08.869]  Of course that's what the Chinese and the North Koreans and the Vietnamese did to their citizens.
[02:14:09.689 --> 02:14:12.451]  And so, it's ominous.
[02:14:13.411 --> 02:14:14.411]  Very, very ominous.
[02:14:14.431 --> 02:14:22.015]  You just reminded me, a bunch of White House officials in the last year have said, we will re-educate Americans.
[02:14:22.055 --> 02:14:23.916]  They're actually talking about that now, openly.
[02:14:25.677 --> 02:14:27.738]  Yeah, they're going through the whole thing.
[02:14:29.051 --> 02:14:52.150]  And all we can do under the circumstances is continue to tell people the truth and educate them and hope that they catch on and we get major demonstrations going, 20 million people visiting Washington, filling every street in the city up, demanding that they stop doing what they're doing.
[02:14:53.371 --> 02:14:55.793]  There is no other legal way for us to do it.
[02:15:01.229 --> 02:15:06.014]  They have to start shutting the web down incrementally because we're kicking their butt.
[02:15:06.155 --> 02:15:11.140]  But the act of doing this will only make our information more valuable, Bob.
[02:15:12.101 --> 02:15:12.582]  That's right.
[02:15:12.762 --> 02:15:14.424]  We'll have an underground, believe me.
[02:15:15.545 --> 02:15:17.888]  There are all kinds of ways to get information out.
[02:15:18.752 --> 02:15:23.636]  Well, on this show, we've told people the whole story and what's happening and what's going to happen and it comes true.
[02:15:24.196 --> 02:15:33.383]  Many people need to archive all the shows off PrisonPlanet.tv, all the films, show that undoubtedly if we don't stop them in the next few, it's going to get worse.
[02:15:33.803 --> 02:15:40.888]  But believe me, when we're under super hardcore tyranny, spreading this info, people will listen even more.
[02:15:41.148 --> 02:15:42.709]  That's the little trick about tyranny.
[02:15:43.070 --> 02:15:45.832]  Once it's really in place, everyone wakes up.
[02:15:50.299 --> 02:15:54.501]  And then what happens next is that this acts against tyranny.
[02:15:55.642 --> 02:16:00.805]  And that's what Homeland Security's for, and they're going to list all resistance to that as terrorism.
[02:16:01.885 --> 02:16:10.270]  Well, that probably would be considered by them that at that time, because what it'll involve is aggressive activities.
[02:16:11.250 --> 02:16:14.672]  And they certainly can't be anything but insurgent activities.
[02:16:15.353 --> 02:16:15.693]  I don't
[02:16:31.323 --> 02:16:32.844]  Inter-American warfare.
[02:16:33.244 --> 02:16:35.085]  That's why they like to move incrementally.
[02:16:35.385 --> 02:16:36.806]  That's why they like to move slow.
[02:16:37.126 --> 02:16:42.589]  But now they can't move slow anymore, and I just... Let me tell you, the cops have got a rough job when they try to carry all this out.
[02:16:43.029 --> 02:16:44.490]  Let's go to Taylor in Washington.
[02:16:44.530 --> 02:16:45.291]  Taylor, you're on the air.
[02:16:45.331 --> 02:16:45.711]  Go ahead.
[02:16:45.731 --> 02:16:49.573]  Um, Alex?
[02:16:50.093 --> 02:16:50.353]  Hey!
[02:16:50.393 --> 02:16:50.994]  You're on the air.
[02:16:51.054 --> 02:16:51.814]  What can I do for you?
[02:16:53.295 --> 02:16:57.457]  Um, just had a brief story about, uh, about the gun law thing.
[02:16:57.477 --> 02:16:57.517]  Um...
[02:16:59.591 --> 02:17:09.856]  This summer I was working with this guy, he's from Mexico, and, well, and his dad owned an avocado farm down in Mexico, nothing special.
[02:17:09.876 --> 02:17:19.801]  Basically, he had to go back down to Mexico to rescue his dad from the Mexican cartel, and he had to pay him off 20 grand just so that he could see his dad again.
[02:17:19.821 --> 02:17:28.585]  Yeah, that's what happens when societies collapse, but CPS grabs your kids, makes you pay 20 grand to get them back, but go ahead.
[02:17:29.457 --> 02:17:32.439]  Well, that's also what happens when you don't have any guns.
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:39.144]  When you don't have a right to defend yourself, you know, the police are no good, because they pretty much have to join the criminals.
[02:17:39.164 --> 02:17:43.607]  Yeah, I know, and that's how societies collapse like Haiti or Mexico.
[02:17:44.007 --> 02:17:45.088]  Bob Chapman, any comments?
[02:17:46.489 --> 02:17:47.550]  He's absolutely correct.
[02:17:48.431 --> 02:17:50.192]  And it becomes one.
[02:17:51.173 --> 02:17:59.301]  And I know that law enforcement doesn't want to go that way, but again, in order to protect their jobs, many of them will.
[02:17:59.901 --> 02:18:00.822]  Some of them will quit.
[02:18:01.422 --> 02:18:02.624]  Let's take another call.
[02:18:03.965 --> 02:18:04.425]  Et cetera.
[02:18:05.046 --> 02:18:05.726]  Thank you, Taylor.
[02:18:06.047 --> 02:18:07.868]  John in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:18:08.589 --> 02:18:14.714]  Yes, Alex, you know I support about 70% of what you're saying, but I would like people to check these words on a Google search.
[02:18:15.295 --> 02:18:15.996]  CIA, Nazis,
[02:18:18.163 --> 02:18:26.333]  John Birch Society and John Rhys and Western Goals because I think in many cases you claim you don't want to have people divided against each other.
[02:18:26.934 --> 02:18:30.155]  But you're using the same kinds of quote-unquote pro-practice.
[02:18:30.516 --> 02:18:32.056]  No, you don't like me talking.
[02:18:32.096 --> 02:18:32.837]  Hold on, John.
[02:18:33.017 --> 02:18:35.698]  John, you've been calling for six, seven, eight years.
[02:18:36.158 --> 02:18:41.601]  Every time I talk bad about communists, communists are bad, collectivists are bad, Nazis are bad.
[02:18:41.821 --> 02:18:44.142]  We're not Nazis because we don't like communists.
[02:18:44.682 --> 02:18:48.344]  This isn't the Great War between Russia and Germany.
[02:18:48.724 --> 02:18:51.225]  I'm not on Rommel's side or something.
[02:18:51.285 --> 02:18:53.026]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:18:53.806 --> 02:18:54.346]  The entire
[02:18:56.187 --> 02:19:01.550]  White House lawyer staff call themselves communists, and I point out they're not communists, they're banker looters.
[02:19:02.031 --> 02:19:06.213]  And you've got to be hiding on the other side of the moon to not get that.
[02:19:08.475 --> 02:19:10.256]  Bob Chapman comments on what he was just saying.
[02:19:12.217 --> 02:19:13.378]  I think you covered it, Alex.
[02:19:14.338 --> 02:19:16.500]  I mean, John, you call in... That's the beginning and end of it.
[02:19:17.455 --> 02:19:19.696]  I mean, you call in with the same crud every time.
[02:19:20.216 --> 02:19:23.697]  Obviously the government infiltrated right-wing groups and left-wing groups.
[02:19:24.037 --> 02:19:25.157]  We're here exposing that.
[02:19:25.477 --> 02:19:27.978]  I just did two days on COINTELPRO exposing that.
[02:19:28.998 --> 02:19:33.819]  You're telling me I'm engaged in COINTELPRO when I'm pointing out I don't want to live under communism.
[02:19:35.540 --> 02:19:36.260]  John, stay there.
[02:19:36.300 --> 02:19:37.400]  I want to come back with you and Bob.
[02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:38.721]  I just want to ask you a question.
[02:19:39.321 --> 02:19:42.862]  Does most of the White House openly write articles saying communism's good?
[02:19:43.928 --> 02:19:45.028]  Okay, I mean, come on.
[02:19:45.128 --> 02:19:48.229]  It does exist, and we're not COINTELPRO because we say it.
[02:19:51.370 --> 02:19:54.411]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:19:54.751 --> 02:19:58.352]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:19:58.652 --> 02:20:02.113]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:20:02.373 --> 02:20:09.855]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[02:20:09.855 --> 02:20:10.355]  Yeah, I think so, too.

[02:20:51.042 --> 02:20:52.043]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:20:52.123 --> 02:20:56.907]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:20:57.067 --> 02:21:04.873]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:21:05.134 --> 02:21:10.498]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:21:10.718 --> 02:21:17.704]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:21:17.984 --> 02:21:23.307]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:21:23.587 --> 02:21:28.289]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[02:21:28.649 --> 02:21:36.273]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:21:36.593 --> 02:21:39.274]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[02:21:39.734 --> 02:21:42.816]  Gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:21:43.137 --> 02:21:46.659]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:46.999 --> 02:21:49.281]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:51.663 --> 02:21:55.325]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:55.665 --> 02:21:58.688]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:58.928 --> 02:22:00.329]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:03.691]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:22:03.711 --> 02:22:09.954]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:10.094 --> 02:22:15.136]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:22:15.296 --> 02:22:18.438]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:22:18.558 --> 02:22:25.301]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:22:25.401 --> 02:22:27.522]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:22:27.762 --> 02:22:29.082]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:29.342 --> 02:22:30.203]  And the Congress is saying,
[02:22:30.583 --> 02:22:31.604]  Who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:31.784 --> 02:22:33.626]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:22:33.927 --> 02:22:38.732]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:22:39.072 --> 02:22:48.162]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:50.808 --> 02:22:52.049]  This is an emergency alert.
[02:22:52.570 --> 02:22:54.632]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[02:22:54.992 --> 02:22:57.995]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[02:22:58.536 --> 02:23:02.780]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[02:23:03.321 --> 02:23:08.486]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[02:23:09.066 --> 02:23:13.289]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[02:23:13.569 --> 02:23:19.592]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[02:23:20.013 --> 02:23:21.253]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[02:23:21.653 --> 02:23:27.757]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[02:23:28.137 --> 02:23:29.798]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[02:23:30.178 --> 02:23:35.201]  Use Zeolife and OxySilver Hydrosol instead to detox and de-germ your body.
[02:23:35.521 --> 02:23:38.103]  Stop the shock of toxicity and preventable deaths.
[02:23:38.403 --> 02:23:42.425]  There has never been one case of communists taking over where they don't
[02:24:07.893 --> 02:24:11.615]  Rob and steal from people.
[02:24:14.076 --> 02:24:17.918]  There has not been one case in modern history.
[02:24:18.479 --> 02:24:20.820]  Look at the communists in Russia, China, everywhere.
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:24.602]  Look at how they're always funded by the big banks on record.
[02:24:25.747 --> 02:24:33.630]  Look at how we have seen the government health care plan cheered on by the collectivists, the communists, the socialists, the free-ride people.
[02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:37.271]  And, oh, lo and behold, they're going to get their Medicare and Medicaid cut.
[02:24:37.871 --> 02:24:39.652]  Lo and behold, they're going to get a lower standard of care.
[02:24:40.612 --> 02:24:41.872]  It's all a theft.
[02:24:42.613 --> 02:24:43.733]  It's all a theft.
[02:24:44.966 --> 02:24:48.469]  I guess Dennis Kucinich, according to John, is COINTELPRO then, because he's saying what I'm saying.
[02:24:48.750 --> 02:24:53.874]  Here we are, day after day, exposing the Nazis in every major case of being COINTELPRO.
[02:24:53.894 --> 02:24:55.816]  They run both sides of the control paradigm.
[02:24:56.176 --> 02:24:58.278]  Everything I'm about is shattering that paradigm.
[02:24:58.939 --> 02:25:08.388]  And John calls in and cannot get out of it, because he's religiously committed to it, and he will never, no matter if he listens for a thousand years, ever understand it.
[02:25:08.708 --> 02:25:09.669]  Isn't that right, John?
[02:25:10.666 --> 02:25:25.415]  Well, you know, if anybody is committed to dogma, I think it's your mentor, the John Birch Society, who has been intimately involved with COINTELPRO through the 50s, 60s, and 70s, using your kinds of slander, this fire hose of sewer water, smearing people.
[02:25:25.895 --> 02:25:26.975]  I've been exposing Obama.
[02:25:26.995 --> 02:25:27.516]  You know what, John?
[02:25:27.536 --> 02:25:28.116]  Stop right there.
[02:25:28.296 --> 02:25:28.576]  Stop.
[02:25:28.616 --> 02:25:29.337]  Put him on hold.
[02:25:29.817 --> 02:25:38.982]  I was sent little snippets of George Washington's letter saying, on the contrary, sir, no one is more satisfied of the fact that the Illuminati is operating in the U.S.
[02:25:39.022 --> 02:25:39.343]  than I.
[02:25:40.163 --> 02:25:42.284]  People said, look, he's satisfied with the Illuminati.
[02:25:42.504 --> 02:25:44.225]  He means I'm satisfied it's operating.
[02:25:44.485 --> 02:25:49.487]  The next paragraph said it is the most despicable, horrible group of Jacobins and criminals out of France.
[02:25:49.947 --> 02:25:52.428]  I've been fighting them in my entire last administration.
[02:25:52.728 --> 02:25:54.069]  And I fight them now that I've left.
[02:25:55.555 --> 02:25:57.598]  And I hear this about the John Birch Society.
[02:25:57.658 --> 02:25:58.839]  It's all made up.
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:00.741]  It's made up crud.
[02:26:01.082 --> 02:26:03.565]  The government tried to infiltrate them and demonize them.
[02:26:04.045 --> 02:26:04.866]  It's made up.
[02:26:05.186 --> 02:26:06.007]  It's made up.
[02:26:06.128 --> 02:26:07.329]  You have no proof, John.
[02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:09.071]  Anything else, John?
[02:26:09.592 --> 02:26:15.659]  Yes, just look up those connections between the Nazi CIA network brought in, the FBI,
[02:26:16.079 --> 02:26:21.362]  And the COINTELPO operations collaborating with those groups and John Birch Society during those decades.
[02:26:21.662 --> 02:26:32.768]  They were the most scabrous elements, scurrilous elements, working for the CIA, the FBI, and discrediting people, calling them communists, making up stuff, trying to provoke things.
[02:26:33.068 --> 02:26:42.093]  They did it through their private intelligence group, the Western Goals Association, which was allied in Germany with the Galen Nazi organization.
[02:26:42.373 --> 02:26:45.255]  So if this is your inspiration and your source of truth,
[02:26:45.675 --> 02:26:47.417]  About Communism and Socialism.
[02:26:47.717 --> 02:26:50.080]  You know I exposed Obama long before you did.
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:53.063]  You know I exposed this... Long before I did?
[02:26:53.123 --> 02:26:55.165]  Like I don't even know your last name, John.
[02:26:55.185 --> 02:26:56.046]  I know nothing about you.
[02:26:56.487 --> 02:26:57.388]  I appreciate your call.
[02:26:57.448 --> 02:26:58.929]  I appreciate your delusional call.
[02:27:00.010 --> 02:27:01.352]  I know you... No!
[02:27:01.612 --> 02:27:03.654]  I know you live in Ohio, or you say you do.
[02:27:03.674 --> 02:27:08.039]  I know you call once a month any time I talk bad about Communists.
[02:27:09.420 --> 02:27:13.022]  My inspiration is the Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence Constitution.
[02:27:13.522 --> 02:27:17.624]  And I have found in John Birch's books and videos I've watched, it's all extremely accurate.
[02:27:17.644 --> 02:27:21.226]  I mean, it's a fact that big banks fund the communists.
[02:27:22.027 --> 02:27:26.729]  It's a fact they're funding all these people that say they're communists in the Obama administration.
[02:27:26.749 --> 02:27:29.451]  You're a COINTELPRO with what you're doing.
[02:27:29.491 --> 02:27:34.173]  I don't believe you're consciously doing it, but I mean, this is how this divide and conquer works.
[02:27:35.654 --> 02:27:38.336]  I spent the last few weeks, but really the last two days, intensely.
[02:27:39.187 --> 02:27:44.250]  About how Hal Turner and the Nazis are FBI, and how he's an FBI agent with a proven federal court.
[02:27:46.271 --> 02:27:53.595]  I spend all this time exposing how all of this is going on, and then you call in and accuse me?
[02:27:54.856 --> 02:27:57.517]  I'm here fighting against the government takeover of healthcare.
[02:27:58.058 --> 02:27:59.539]  I'm fighting against new wars.
[02:28:00.399 --> 02:28:04.221]  I'm fighting against corrupt Rick Perry and Kay Bailey Hutchinson.
[02:28:04.862 --> 02:28:05.382]  I'm good!
[02:28:06.886 --> 02:28:08.127]  I know communism's bad.
[02:28:08.167 --> 02:28:12.291]  You always call in on the other calls and plug communist websites and stuff and tell me how great they are.
[02:28:12.751 --> 02:28:13.812]  Give me a break, man!
[02:28:14.773 --> 02:28:16.955]  Just because I don't like communism doesn't mean I'm bad!
[02:28:16.975 --> 02:28:19.877]  I mean, it's sick!
[02:28:21.699 --> 02:28:26.643]  The Russians declassified all their files on McCarthy and how he was absolutely right and they were worried about him.
[02:28:27.764 --> 02:28:30.587]  Because McCarthy found out the army was funding Russia!
[02:28:32.020 --> 02:28:33.661]  Joe Stalin was our ally!
[02:28:34.061 --> 02:28:35.361]  They helped keep him in power!
[02:28:35.381 --> 02:28:36.542]  They gave him all the weapons!
[02:28:37.662 --> 02:28:38.543]  They gave him nukes!
[02:28:39.863 --> 02:28:41.184]  They fried some patsies!
[02:28:43.164 --> 02:28:44.165]  And I've tried to... You know what?
[02:28:44.845 --> 02:28:46.906]  John, every time he calls, I explain the basics to him.
[02:28:46.926 --> 02:28:47.586]  He doesn't understand it.
[02:28:48.767 --> 02:28:51.468]  John, it's a synthesis of the two sides.
[02:28:52.508 --> 02:28:56.770]  The big banks needed to have an artificial clash of civilizations.
[02:28:57.950 --> 02:29:01.731]  Just like they fund radical Muslims, so they then have a pretext to go into those countries.
[02:29:01.811 --> 02:29:02.952]  That's the more modern system.
[02:29:03.592 --> 02:29:12.734]  With communism, and it's been declassified, the West, the British, and the U.S., and others, and big banks, on record, the people that took over Russia came out of Brooklyn.
[02:29:13.855 --> 02:29:14.795]  They shipped them over there, 1917, 1918.
[02:29:16.376 --> 02:29:24.518]  I'll finish up with this when we come back, because it's an important issue, as we try to shatter the left-right paradigm.
[02:29:25.657 --> 02:29:28.879]  The left-right paradigm is communism on one end and fascism on the other.
[02:29:29.540 --> 02:29:32.702]  And when you really look at fascism and communism, they're basically the same thing.
[02:29:33.202 --> 02:29:35.183]  A boot stomping on the human face forever.
[02:29:36.364 --> 02:29:37.925]  I mean, it's just disgusting, John.
[02:29:37.945 --> 02:29:39.086]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:29:40.887 --> 02:29:41.788]  We're on the march.
[02:29:42.288 --> 02:29:43.889]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:44.810 --> 02:29:47.512]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:50.285 --> 02:29:57.127]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:29:57.248 --> 02:29:59.208]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:29:59.348 --> 02:30:01.469]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:30:01.589 --> 02:30:03.110]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:30:03.250 --> 02:30:07.571]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[02:30:07.711 --> 02:30:10.092]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[02:30:10.292 --> 02:30:14.914]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:30:14.994 --> 02:30:21.017]  For your home or business, their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[02:30:21.078 --> 02:30:23.819]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[02:30:23.919 --> 02:30:26.541]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[02:30:26.641 --> 02:30:33.785]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[02:30:34.085 --> 02:30:40.007]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[02:30:40.047 --> 02:30:42.288]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:30:42.889 --> 02:30:49.431]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:30:51.972 --> 02:30:55.594]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:55.994 --> 02:30:58.995]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:59.195 --> 02:31:00.636]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:31:01.557 --> 02:31:03.998]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:04.018 --> 02:31:10.280]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:10.420 --> 02:31:15.442]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:31:15.942 --> 02:31:25.586]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:31:25.706 --> 02:31:27.808]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:31:28.048 --> 02:31:29.369]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:29.649 --> 02:31:31.931]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:32.111 --> 02:31:33.932]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:31:33.952 --> 02:31:39.036]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:39.376 --> 02:31:44.160]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:44.380 --> 02:31:48.483]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:51.408 --> 02:31:51.928]  Hi, neighbor.
[02:31:52.209 --> 02:31:54.930]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[02:31:55.511 --> 02:32:00.234]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[02:32:00.794 --> 02:32:05.917]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[02:32:06.538 --> 02:32:13.622]  We would intend not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[02:32:14.143 --> 02:32:19.046]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the bread line may have no bread.
[02:32:19.657 --> 02:32:26.678]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[02:32:27.479 --> 02:32:31.899]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[02:32:32.580 --> 02:32:32.860]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:32:32.880 --> 02:32:32.940]  800-409-5633.
[02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:33.820]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:33.880 --> 02:32:34.060]  Who am I?
[02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:34.720]  Someone who cares.
[02:32:53.061 --> 02:32:58.404]  The ruling elite have written literally thousands of white papers.
[02:33:00.045 --> 02:33:07.330]  Professor Carol Quigley wrote a close to thousand page book called Tragedy and Hope through a State Department secret grant.
[02:33:08.891 --> 02:33:10.632]  It was later republished to the public.
[02:33:11.553 --> 02:33:18.077]  Bill Clinton's mentor, head of political science, Georgetown, he explains that British imperial roundtable groups
[02:33:19.011 --> 02:33:34.739]  Corporate private government management teams were dispatched around the globe by the turn of the last century, over a hundred years ago, to take down their imperial flags and run up the local flag, but to control it from behind the scenes.
[02:33:35.519 --> 02:33:43.463]  And to do that, they wanted to infiltrate, take over, or if they couldn't, destroy all alternative groups that didn't want to be under their domination.
[02:33:45.268 --> 02:33:52.231]  And it's not the British Empire that rules the planet, it's that management system run by a consortium of private banks and corporations.
[02:33:52.811 --> 02:33:56.752]  England, the United States, Israel, countries in Europe being the chief holders of it.
[02:33:58.973 --> 02:34:03.855]  Now, it's on record that Stalin was our ally in World War II.
[02:34:04.875 --> 02:34:08.757]  It's on record that Patton was killed because he didn't want to go along with it.
[02:34:09.937 --> 02:34:11.698]  It's on record that
[02:34:12.611 --> 02:34:19.553]  They wanted to use anti-communist movement in the country to restrict free speech, get control of Hollywood, and create a synthesis.
[02:34:19.933 --> 02:34:27.296]  By having communists call for communism, then the government could just call for higher taxes and not sound as anti-American.
[02:34:27.576 --> 02:34:30.317]  They moved everything over towards the collectivist angle.
[02:34:31.718 --> 02:34:33.699]  Which the fascists and the communists always want.
[02:34:33.979 --> 02:34:38.742]  The tyrants always want to deal with a strong man, with a thug, with an oligarchy.
[02:34:39.002 --> 02:34:40.623]  That's what Carol Quigley explains.
[02:34:40.663 --> 02:34:42.184]  He says it's a good thing and he's for it.
[02:34:43.165 --> 02:34:50.189]  And it's publication after publication after publication of these guys explaining how they do it and you just don't get it.
[02:34:51.470 --> 02:34:55.272]  Of course the FBI and others infiltrated any group they could.
[02:34:55.292 --> 02:34:57.113]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:34:57.494 --> 02:34:59.115]  That's what I'm exposing here.
[02:35:01.272 --> 02:35:09.415]  And of course, McCarthy was very useful for them, he meant well, while he was just going after leftists and people.
[02:35:11.556 --> 02:35:19.959]  But as soon as he found out the Army and State Department are basically running Russia, as soon as he found out about that, he was shut down instantly.
[02:35:21.072 --> 02:35:31.161]  Now, I go back to the fact that collectivism never works and isn't a good thing, but looking at the false bipolar world, by funding Soviet expansion worldwide,
[02:35:32.421 --> 02:35:37.146]  The Soviets got to suppress their people because they were fighting an outside threat, a stage crisis.
[02:35:37.786 --> 02:35:43.853]  The United States got to suppress its people, grow a giant military industrial complex, financed by the same central banks.
[02:35:44.373 --> 02:35:50.880]  The Rothschilds going back 300 years, to Italy and Germany, and France and Britain, financing both sides.
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:53.082]  This is part of mainline history.
[02:35:54.215 --> 02:36:00.759]  And so they get to build up huge centralized governments of different flavors in the U.S., in Europe, in Russia, in Asia.
[02:36:01.299 --> 02:36:07.523]  They get to play countries off against each other, divide countries, give half of Germany to the Russians, half to the allies.
[02:36:08.283 --> 02:36:09.624]  You know, have these little wars.
[02:36:10.684 --> 02:36:14.747]  Ford and GM-owned factories were making the trucks that were shipped to northern Vietnam.
[02:36:16.007 --> 02:36:17.208]  I mean, this is the reality.
[02:36:19.009 --> 02:36:22.191]  This is how they control the paradigm and dominate society.
[02:36:24.983 --> 02:36:36.127]  And any group that rises up and is legitimate and threatens the power of the elite and their system and the existing political order is infiltrated and taken over.
[02:36:36.167 --> 02:36:38.047]  In fact, let me read from COINTELPRO here.
[02:36:38.067 --> 02:36:40.048]  Let me close shot of this document.
[02:36:40.088 --> 02:36:40.808]  COINTELPRO.
[02:36:42.189 --> 02:36:49.111]  COINTELPRO, in an acronym for Counterintelligence Program, was a series of covert and often illegal, now the White House openly calls for it,
[02:36:49.986 --> 02:36:50.306]  Illegal.
[02:36:50.806 --> 02:36:58.549]  Projects conducted by the United States Federal Investigation, FBI, aimed at investigating and disrupting dissenting political organizations within the United States.
[02:36:58.949 --> 02:37:01.149]  The FBI has covered operations from its inception.
[02:37:01.189 --> 02:37:04.950]  However, formal COINTELPRO operations took place between 1956 and 1971.
[02:37:05.451 --> 02:37:15.093]  The FBI stated motivation at the time was protecting, this is a quote, they have links to the documents, national security, that means the banker's security, what's NORTHCOM there for?
[02:37:15.113 --> 02:37:16.274]  To make sure the robbery's complete.
[02:37:16.874 --> 02:37:18.215]  To make sure they can rob us and get away with it.
[02:37:18.575 --> 02:37:23.477]  Protecting national security, preventing violence, and maintaining the existing social and political order.
[02:37:23.818 --> 02:37:26.639]  And that meant Nixon having a plan to bomb the DNC.
[02:37:26.659 --> 02:37:27.159]  Remember that?
[02:37:27.740 --> 02:37:28.980]  That's even on Nightline.
[02:37:30.241 --> 02:37:31.502]  I mean, it's declassified.
[02:37:32.942 --> 02:37:35.804]  And to blame it on his political enemies, which was the left at the time.
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:55.154]  According to FBI records, 85% of COINTELPRO resources were expended on infiltrating, disrupting, marginalizing, and or subverting groups suspected of being subversive, such as communist and socialist organizations, the women's rights movement, militant black nationalist groups, and non-violent civil rights movement.
[02:37:55.374 --> 02:38:00.057]  Yeah, the Black Panthers at first were, let's have soup kitchens, let's get our people off drugs.
[02:38:00.398 --> 02:38:04.561]  Then the feds messed with them and made them get radical, which is what their plan was.
[02:38:08.604 --> 02:38:16.446]  It's COINTELPRO to have militia people, a guy owns a bass boat, he's now the admiral, literally, I've seen that, show up at city councils and threaten people.
[02:38:16.767 --> 02:38:18.507]  To then demonize real militias.
[02:38:18.987 --> 02:38:21.048]  To demonize the militia in the Constitution.
[02:38:21.528 --> 02:38:25.189]  They don't want you in suits and ties getting the state to pass it to defend the border.
[02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:27.530]  They want you to look like kooks.
[02:38:30.990 --> 02:38:34.416]  Nonviolent civil rights movement including individuals such as Martin Luther King Jr.
[02:38:34.436 --> 02:38:39.685]  and others associated with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
[02:38:41.218 --> 02:38:43.060]  It's self-funded by big foundations.
[02:38:43.420 --> 02:38:48.064]  The Congress of Racial Equality, the American Indian Movement, and other civil rights groups.
[02:38:48.604 --> 02:39:00.694]  A broad range of organizations labeled New Left, including Students for Democratic Society, the National Lawyers Guild, the Weathermen, almost all groups protesting the Vietnam War, and even individual student demonstrations with no group affiliation.
[02:39:00.714 --> 02:39:01.735]  Yeah, that's what it was really aimed at.
[02:39:02.836 --> 02:39:06.199]  And national groups such as those seeking independence for Puerto Rico.
[02:39:08.510 --> 02:39:20.721]  The other 15% was expended to marginalize and subvert white hate groups including the Ku Klux Klan, national states, and national states' rights parties.
[02:39:21.656 --> 02:39:23.216]  Yeah, I've studied COINTELPRO.
[02:39:23.556 --> 02:39:30.658]  Most of it has been against conservatives and libertarians, but they would always fashionalize the left groups.
[02:39:31.138 --> 02:39:32.298]  Most of it was all staged.
[02:39:32.338 --> 02:39:37.399]  Like Patty Hearst, declassified last year, but that was all staged with her and those terrorists.
[02:39:37.699 --> 02:39:39.000]  She was not captured by them.
[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:41.560]  She wasn't having Stockholm Syndrome serving them.
[02:39:42.360 --> 02:39:43.981]  So, I want to go to your calls.
[02:39:44.081 --> 02:39:44.461]  It's just...
[02:39:46.172 --> 02:39:49.333]  They have to divide the world between the Soviet Empire and the U.S.
[02:39:49.373 --> 02:39:57.515]  British Empire so that they can all carry out crimes and take over countries and have an excuse to be in those Latin American and Asian nations.
[02:39:58.055 --> 02:40:02.016]  And the average FBI agent, the average KGB agent, didn't even know what they were part of.
[02:40:02.316 --> 02:40:03.797]  This is why the bankers rule.
[02:40:03.917 --> 02:40:04.597]  They're smart.
[02:40:04.877 --> 02:40:05.557]  They're slick.
[02:40:05.877 --> 02:40:06.938]  They know what they're doing.
[02:40:07.518 --> 02:40:08.318]  How do you cut them off?
[02:40:11.536 --> 02:40:15.359]  The right wing never complains about corporate welfare.
[02:40:15.519 --> 02:40:23.364]  The right wing, mainline Republicans never complain when there's tens of trillions for the banks or tens of trillions for wars over the decades.
[02:40:24.105 --> 02:40:27.147]  They're mad about the welfare lady on welfare.
[02:40:27.767 --> 02:40:37.194]  The left is mad at corporate welfare, but not when they get in power like Obama, the biggest defense budget in history, breaking his record last year of the biggest in history.
[02:40:38.095 --> 02:40:49.428]  So it's left-wing rhetoric to control their fake left-wing methodology with the general public as the false revolution they push the revolution into that they know is organic so they can control it.
[02:40:50.029 --> 02:40:55.856]  And yes, they do infiltrate and try to infiltrate right-wing groups, radicalize them, control them, create fake groups.
[02:40:55.916 --> 02:40:56.857]  Yes, that's going on.
[02:40:57.197 --> 02:40:57.438]  Yes.
[02:40:59.383 --> 02:41:03.045]  But does that not mean that some of the ideas of the left aren't legitimate?
[02:41:03.085 --> 02:41:05.086]  Like, let's not sterilize Indian women?
[02:41:05.987 --> 02:41:09.169]  Or, many of the ideas of the mainline right aren't real?
[02:41:09.189 --> 02:41:10.429]  Like, let's have lower taxes?
[02:41:11.610 --> 02:41:14.592]  Bigger government is the tool for the corporate looting.
[02:41:15.953 --> 02:41:19.495]  But the average leftist who is
[02:41:22.043 --> 02:41:27.377]  Angry at George Washington because he owns slaves, and that was the practice worldwide.
[02:41:27.418 --> 02:41:30.165]  Then he freed his slaves, by the way, and wrote against it.
[02:41:31.135 --> 02:41:33.436]  But the slaves were like, please don't ship me back to Africa.
[02:41:33.456 --> 02:41:35.437]  It depended where they were.
[02:41:35.477 --> 02:41:36.637]  It was case by case.
[02:41:37.017 --> 02:41:39.858]  And most of them, when they would be freed, said, I don't want to leave.
[02:41:40.418 --> 02:41:44.380]  When you see stuff like Roots and shows like that, that is the extreme examples.
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:45.660]  It was a horrible institution.
[02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:48.541]  But it still goes on through government debt and control today.
[02:41:48.561 --> 02:41:50.442]  What do you think the third world's under?
[02:41:50.582 --> 02:41:51.662]  The IMF and World Bank?
[02:41:51.703 --> 02:41:52.803]  They're in a form of slavery.
[02:41:55.014 --> 02:42:10.497]  So instead of obsessing on the time that George Washington lived in, 230 plus years ago, which the media does, why don't they talk about how the UN and eco-science all talks about how they want to kill off the third world brown people.
[02:42:11.877 --> 02:42:21.919]  See, when you get up to elite leftist level, like Cass Sunstein, President Obama's appointed to head the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.
[02:42:31.115 --> 02:42:42.023]  Again, when you get up to the level of this individual right here on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, he calls it liberal to ban free speech or criticism of the government.
[02:42:42.063 --> 02:42:44.004]  He calls it liberal to take your guns.
[02:42:44.344 --> 02:42:46.986]  True classical liberalism is have all the guns you want.
[02:42:47.326 --> 02:42:48.667]  Have all the private property you want.
[02:42:48.727 --> 02:42:49.468]  You be free.
[02:42:49.748 --> 02:42:51.109]  Just don't enslave anybody else.
[02:42:51.209 --> 02:42:52.410]  It's all a fraud.
[02:42:52.670 --> 02:42:57.954]  You guys are like computers that have been fed false information to where you can't even communicate.
[02:42:59.301 --> 02:43:01.242]  Okay, I said I'm going to go to calls.
[02:43:02.343 --> 02:43:05.085]  Let's go ahead now and go to Joel in Pennsylvania.
[02:43:05.125 --> 02:43:05.705]  Thanks for holding.
[02:43:06.906 --> 02:43:07.886]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:43:08.026 --> 02:43:08.907]  First time in a long time.
[02:43:09.547 --> 02:43:10.148]  Good to talk to you.
[02:43:11.528 --> 02:43:15.171]  I just got a message real quick to all the truthers and patriots out there.
[02:43:15.851 --> 02:43:16.091]  Yes.
[02:43:17.412 --> 02:43:19.593]  Listen, we don't have time to mess around.
[02:43:19.793 --> 02:43:21.795]  The globalists are not playing games.
[02:43:22.275 --> 02:43:23.736]  They're putting fluoride in the water.
[02:43:24.136 --> 02:43:27.278]  They're putting mercury in the high fructose corn syrup.
[02:43:27.818 --> 02:43:28.799]  We don't have time.
[02:43:29.266 --> 02:43:33.070]  We all need to warn everybody, warn our friends, warn our families.
[02:43:33.350 --> 02:43:37.094]  Don't worry if people call you a conspiracy theorist because it doesn't matter.
[02:43:37.175 --> 02:43:38.156]  We know that we're right.
[02:43:38.636 --> 02:43:41.359]  So we have to get the message out to everybody.
[02:43:41.980 --> 02:43:42.881]  Don't worry about it.
[02:43:43.381 --> 02:43:44.462]  In fact, let me stop you.
[02:43:44.502 --> 02:43:45.163]  Let me stop you.
[02:43:45.423 --> 02:43:50.349]  Will you guys print me that article from yesterday about the corn causing liver damage and kidney failure?
[02:43:52.654 --> 02:43:59.016]  Huffington Post linked to mainstream news articles, mainstream scientific institutions that tested it.
[02:43:59.356 --> 02:44:04.198]  They knew the Monsanto corn that grows its own pesticide in it, that bugs won't eat.
[02:44:04.318 --> 02:44:05.258]  If they do, they die.
[02:44:05.598 --> 02:44:07.359]  They knew that hurt everybody.
[02:44:07.719 --> 02:44:08.879]  They knew that a decade ago.
[02:44:09.259 --> 02:44:10.960]  Every major GMO crop.
[02:44:12.066 --> 02:44:22.811]  is devastating the rodents it's fed to and absolutely absolutely we can't stop talking about left and right that we've generationally been trained to fight with each other and
[02:44:23.934 --> 02:44:37.438]  Even though we're drinking aspartame, hundreds of chemicals put in the water under the name fluoride, mass brain damage, admitted bone cancer, GMO killing us, all these new illnesses popping up, all this stuff happening.
[02:44:38.178 --> 02:44:43.900]  They artificially, Washington Post admits, half of the fructose corn syrup has high levels of mercury.
[02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:48.961]  They tell you melamine that kills you is now okay for your baby, Associated Press.
[02:44:49.261 --> 02:44:51.322]  They think you're so under mind control.
[02:44:52.506 --> 02:45:05.370]  That the White House can come out and say, we're going to ban your free speech, start shutting down the web, arrest you if you criticize the government, ban your Second Amendment, and mercury's good for you, lead is good in children's toys.
[02:45:05.410 --> 02:45:08.071]  Folks, if you think I'm joking, I've played all these clips before.
[02:45:08.671 --> 02:45:10.051]  This is real, folks.
[02:45:10.151 --> 02:45:14.713]  This is, I mean, have you seen the clip where CBS News says mercury's now good for children's brains, Joel?
[02:45:15.563 --> 02:45:17.004]  Yes, I've seen it.
[02:45:17.044 --> 02:45:20.306]  I mean, they are practicing mass insanity.
[02:45:20.707 --> 02:45:26.490]  They say insane things, and we're a social animal, and so we just start accepting it.
[02:45:26.551 --> 02:45:27.571]  Oh, poison's good!
[02:45:28.032 --> 02:45:31.914]  Just like a thousand years ago, Aztecs chopping people's hearts out.
[02:45:32.334 --> 02:45:39.840]  If you teleported back a thousand years ago in a time machine and said, don't kill your kid, it's crazy, they would kill you thinking you were nuts.
[02:45:40.640 --> 02:45:43.382]  The psych warfare chiefs know what they're doing!
[02:45:43.922 --> 02:45:44.483]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:45.043 --> 02:45:53.489]  And they think we're stupid enough and domesticated enough to buy into all their propaganda and all their brainwashing that they constantly push at us.
[02:45:53.905 --> 02:45:58.649]  But this is a message to the globalists and the NSA that I know that are listening right now.
[02:45:58.829 --> 02:45:59.930]  We're not going to put up with it.
[02:46:00.130 --> 02:46:02.332]  We're going to stand up for our freedom and for our rights.
[02:46:02.692 --> 02:46:09.577]  We all have to stand outside of shopping malls, go into highly populated areas, and burn DVDs and hand them out to people.
[02:46:10.978 --> 02:46:12.119]  People want to stop this.
[02:46:12.820 --> 02:46:15.242]  Folks, stop worrying about groups and names.
[02:46:15.322 --> 02:46:17.003]  Say, get the poison out of my water.
[02:46:17.063 --> 02:46:18.744]  In every poll over...
[02:46:19.585 --> 02:46:20.345]  It depends on the poll.
[02:46:20.385 --> 02:46:30.809]  It's over 70% want sodium fluoride out of the water, which they admit gives you bone cancer, which they admit sterilizes you, mainstream government reports, but they make movies making fun of us so yuppies laugh.
[02:46:31.189 --> 02:46:38.092]  It's not funny that most women have their hair falling out now by age 30, that they're being sterilized, that their thyroids are burning out.
[02:46:38.472 --> 02:46:38.852]  It's not
[02:46:39.172 --> 02:46:44.933]  It's funny that they know that the main variety of corn we're eating causes liver and kidney failure.
[02:46:45.313 --> 02:46:46.053]  They know.
[02:46:46.434 --> 02:46:50.694]  Folks, it's so real and we've just got to be seen.
[02:46:50.974 --> 02:47:00.236]  We've got to get out of the TV, get out of the NFL playoffs, start talking, standing up at church, educating people, getting aggressive to shake people.
[02:47:00.276 --> 02:47:02.837]  See, they slowly ease you in like a frog in the cold water.
[02:47:03.297 --> 02:47:06.841]  Yes, and also, like I was saying before, a lot of people that don't know what we're talking about
[02:47:23.854 --> 02:47:29.019]  They'll think, oh, you're crazy for talking about this, but we know that we're right and we know that history will vindicate us.
[02:47:29.299 --> 02:47:34.723]  So don't worry about it if people want to call you crazy or a conspiracy theorist or something like that.
[02:47:34.764 --> 02:47:40.829]  When you know you're right, when you know you're on the right side of history and you have the truth on your side, there's nothing that can stop you.
[02:47:41.983 --> 02:47:42.903]  I appreciate your call.
[02:47:42.943 --> 02:47:44.104]  God bless you, Joel.
[02:47:44.124 --> 02:47:46.125]  I'm trying to go to Julio, Jonathan, Curtis, Jane.
[02:47:46.385 --> 02:47:55.629]  You know, I ended the show with this yesterday and I more and more get tempted just to spend most of my time showing people what's in the water, what's in the food, what's in the drugs.
[02:47:56.010 --> 02:47:58.431]  Look, Monsanto, and they have direct links
[02:48:00.721 --> 02:48:03.962]  To the Journal of Biological Sciences.
[02:48:04.362 --> 02:48:05.023]  I looked that up.
[02:48:05.103 --> 02:48:06.283]  One of the most prestigious in the world.
[02:48:06.903 --> 02:48:11.385]  I've literally seen hundreds of confirmed studies on this group of corn alone.
[02:48:12.285 --> 02:48:22.009]  It is MON-863 and NK-603 that grows a live pesticide in the corn so bugs won't eat it.
[02:48:23.356 --> 02:48:25.777]  Well, what do you think poison does, like liquor?
[02:48:25.837 --> 02:48:26.437]  It eats your liver.
[02:48:26.877 --> 02:48:27.877]  Well, it's the same thing with this.
[02:48:27.957 --> 02:48:31.638]  Monsanto GMO corn linked to organ failure study reveals.
[02:48:32.298 --> 02:48:44.161]  In a study released by the International Journal of Biological Sciences, analyzing the effects of genetically modified foods on mammalian life, that's us, mammals, researchers found that agricultural giant Monsanto's GM corn is linked to organ damage in rats.
[02:48:44.861 --> 02:48:46.362]  It's also the stuff killing the honeybees.
[02:48:47.062 --> 02:48:48.183]  Because they'll still eat the pollen.
[02:48:48.703 --> 02:49:01.351]  According to the study, which was summarized by, and it goes through that, three varieties of Monsanto, GM corn, MON-863, insecticide-producing MON-810, and Roundup herbicide-absorbing NK-603.
[02:49:01.592 --> 02:49:04.413]  See, these plants will live in poison because they absorb it.
[02:49:04.954 --> 02:49:06.055]  But then the poison's in it.
[02:49:06.755 --> 02:49:07.696]  Everything else is killed.
[02:49:08.176 --> 02:49:12.439]  We approve the consumption by U.S., European, and several other national food safety authorities.
[02:49:14.335 --> 02:49:22.418]  And it just goes into the effects, this is from the study, we're mostly concentrated in the kidney-liver function, the two major diet detoxification organs.
[02:49:23.198 --> 02:49:26.580]  And then it goes into how it hit other areas of the body, though.
[02:49:30.901 --> 02:49:31.582]  Man, folks.
[02:49:32.002 --> 02:49:41.205]  I mean, I could Google right now, fluoridation of water bone cancer, and literally thousands of studies over 40 years that it's giving people cancer.
[02:49:41.305 --> 02:49:42.686]  They absolutely know.
[02:49:43.954 --> 02:49:44.494]  Red alert!
[02:49:45.035 --> 02:49:45.595]  Red alert!
[02:49:46.076 --> 02:49:46.636]  Red alert!
[02:49:47.116 --> 02:49:47.677]  Red alert!
[02:49:48.157 --> 02:49:48.717]  Red alert!
[02:49:49.138 --> 02:49:49.698]  Red alert!
[02:49:50.058 --> 02:49:50.599]  Red alert!
[02:49:50.959 --> 02:49:51.479]  Red alert!
[02:49:51.819 --> 02:49:52.300]  Red alert!
[02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:55.242]  You read about the Rockefellers and the heads of Monsanto?
[02:49:55.622 --> 02:49:56.903]  They have their own farms.
[02:49:56.963 --> 02:50:08.331]  I was watching a PBS special where the Duke of Edinburgh, Queen Elizabeth's husband, the father of Prince Charles, the admitted Nazi, he's a German Nazi, has his own giant
[02:50:09.448 --> 02:50:12.251]  Farms and ranches, and they fly his food around all over the world.
[02:50:12.271 --> 02:50:13.372]  He only eats his food.
[02:50:13.812 --> 02:50:15.594]  I mean, they're obsessed with it.
[02:50:18.096 --> 02:50:24.001]  They are absolutely... Folks, they are poisoning your food and water to sterilize you and kill you.
[02:50:24.502 --> 02:50:25.823]  We're all in this together.
[02:50:25.923 --> 02:50:29.126]  Liberal, conservative, black, white, Hispanic, cop, non-cop.
[02:50:29.566 --> 02:50:30.748]  Get it through your head!
[02:50:31.894 --> 02:50:35.778]  And COINTELPRO just wants us all to fight with each other over left-right terms.
[02:50:36.639 --> 02:50:38.141]  And to make us not trust each other.
[02:50:38.441 --> 02:50:39.422]  You know you're good.
[02:50:39.763 --> 02:50:40.944]  You know you're a patriot.
[02:50:41.264 --> 02:50:42.626]  Get out and warn people.
[02:50:43.026 --> 02:50:45.229]  And get this stuff off our store shelves.
[02:50:46.030 --> 02:50:46.630]  Come on!
[02:50:47.431 --> 02:50:48.653]  Final call straight ahead.
[02:50:50.734 --> 02:50:54.977]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:50:55.277 --> 02:50:59.360]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:50:59.620 --> 02:51:04.343]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows.
[02:51:06.886 --> 02:51:10.669]  Control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:51:10.989 --> 02:51:11.529]  Number 3.
[02:51:11.810 --> 02:51:15.092]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:51:15.392 --> 02:51:19.115]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:51:19.315 --> 02:51:19.856]  Number 4.
[02:51:20.096 --> 02:51:22.478]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:51:22.858 --> 02:51:26.260]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:51:26.541 --> 02:51:26.761]  Number 5.
[02:51:27.341 --> 02:51:31.244]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:51:31.484 --> 02:51:36.248]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:51:36.528 --> 02:51:40.550]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:51:40.690 --> 02:51:42.931]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:51:43.111 --> 02:51:44.571]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[02:52:01.457 --> 02:52:04.119]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:04.140 --> 02:52:10.385]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:10.525 --> 02:52:15.570]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:18.873]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:52:18.993 --> 02:52:25.699]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:25.819 --> 02:52:27.920]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:28.160 --> 02:52:29.481]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:29.741 --> 02:52:32.022]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:32.202 --> 02:52:34.042]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:34.323 --> 02:52:39.125]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:39.485 --> 02:52:44.267]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:44.487 --> 02:52:48.588]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:50.618 --> 02:52:54.623]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:52:54.743 --> 02:52:57.466]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:52:57.626 --> 02:52:59.568]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:52:59.709 --> 02:53:01.831]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:53:01.931 --> 02:53:03.453]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:53:03.593 --> 02:53:07.938]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[02:53:08.078 --> 02:53:10.361]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[02:53:10.621 --> 02:53:16.427]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[02:53:16.647 --> 02:53:21.372]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[02:53:21.432 --> 02:53:24.175]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[02:53:24.275 --> 02:53:26.898]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[02:53:26.998 --> 02:53:28.319]  This system is free of chemicals.
[02:53:28.599 --> 02:53:29.380]  Look at this headline!
[02:53:29.420 --> 02:53:30.180]  London Guardian!
[02:53:56.462 --> 02:53:58.883]  Fluoride water causes cancer.
[02:53:58.923 --> 02:54:00.503]  Boys at risk from bone tumors.
[02:54:01.103 --> 02:54:01.463]  Shock.
[02:54:02.143 --> 02:54:03.164]  Research reveals.
[02:54:04.704 --> 02:54:07.585]  I read stuff from the 1934 University of Texas.
[02:54:08.445 --> 02:54:10.645]  They've been using it for a hundred years as rat poison.
[02:54:11.986 --> 02:54:12.806]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:14.706 --> 02:54:16.667]  Ladies and gentlemen, you better listen up.
[02:54:16.727 --> 02:54:17.687]  This isn't a game.
[02:54:17.947 --> 02:54:21.708]  The White House science czar proposes putting stuff in the water to sterilize you.
[02:54:21.908 --> 02:54:23.188]  They're already doing it.
[02:54:24.409 --> 02:54:25.169]  Come on!
[02:54:27.557 --> 02:54:28.678]  Get up off your butts!
[02:54:28.758 --> 02:54:31.560]  Quit using the excuse of COINTELPRO and all the infighting.
[02:54:32.860 --> 02:54:33.721]  You know you're good.
[02:54:33.781 --> 02:54:36.222]  Get out there and lead the people and say no to this.
[02:54:37.864 --> 02:54:39.424]  Let's talk to Jonathan in Kansas.
[02:54:39.465 --> 02:54:40.385]  Jonathan, you're on the air.
[02:54:40.405 --> 02:54:40.785]  Go ahead.
[02:54:40.805 --> 02:54:43.187]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:54:43.907 --> 02:54:44.868]  I'm just really sad.
[02:54:45.008 --> 02:54:46.089]  Man, they're killing everybody.
[02:54:46.109 --> 02:54:51.272]  Everybody's dropping dead or getting sick and everybody's busy talking about Sarah Palin and Barack Obama.
[02:54:52.193 --> 02:54:53.954]  Yeah, unfortunate.
[02:54:54.394 --> 02:54:56.035]  Go to YouTube and
[02:54:56.519 --> 02:55:10.331]  Type in transparent wall or and or augmented earth because new scientist is promoting big brother because well you can see for yourself if you look up on the transparent wall.
[02:55:11.872 --> 02:55:12.573]  What does it say?
[02:55:13.594 --> 02:55:20.320]  Well it basically transparent wall is having cameras on it's supposedly supposed to be for
[02:55:21.154 --> 02:55:23.016]  Cars not to get in crashes?
[02:55:23.837 --> 02:55:44.917]  Oh yeah, they're gonna make everybody have their cars robot controlled and they also use that for body armor and for somewhat of invisibility where they have cameras on one end and then like in the movie Predator it's like glistening image of the other side so it looks like nothing's there or it is literally a cloak of invisibility.
[02:55:44.937 --> 02:55:45.798]  Is that what you're talking about?
[02:55:46.893 --> 02:55:47.894]  It's something like that.
[02:55:48.234 --> 02:55:55.460]  And the other one, Augmented Earth, it's basically like Google Street Video, but it actually shows people actually walking.
[02:55:55.900 --> 02:55:57.201]  Like, it's literally Big Brook.
[02:55:57.241 --> 02:55:58.842]  Yes, live feeds of everything.
[02:55:58.862 --> 02:56:00.644]  Yeah, Google, total NSA run.
[02:56:00.684 --> 02:56:01.024]  Thank you.
[02:56:01.064 --> 02:56:01.985]  Yes, I'm aware of that.
[02:56:02.465 --> 02:56:03.426]  It's not the particular term.
[02:56:03.486 --> 02:56:04.707]  Thank you for the interesting point.
[02:56:04.727 --> 02:56:05.187]  Anything else?
[02:56:06.849 --> 02:56:08.550]  Maybe, can I suggest a guest?
[02:56:09.290 --> 02:56:09.791]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:56:12.833 --> 02:56:16.356]  I read this book, you know, called Medical Apartheid.
[02:56:17.114 --> 02:56:18.935]  Hey Alex, I'm a big fan.
[02:56:18.955 --> 02:56:20.797]  I was talking with my family and friends recently.
[02:56:46.601 --> 02:56:52.684]  What kind of scares me pretty badly, actually, is a lot of people would welcome a one-world government.
[02:56:54.705 --> 02:56:57.066]  Yeah, they've been told it's gonna fix all their problems.
[02:56:57.546 --> 02:56:59.927]  While they were building the world government, they said it didn't exist.
[02:57:00.347 --> 02:57:01.888]  Now, oh, it's here, it's good!
[02:57:02.969 --> 02:57:07.731]  And, like, another thing, and I don't want to cast doubt on, like, like I said, I'm a big fan.
[02:57:08.051 --> 02:57:14.834]  It's just recently my head's been spinning, and, you know, I'm a big fan of yours, but I mean, I don't want to cast doubt on you, for your listeners, but I mean, like,
[02:57:15.985 --> 02:57:19.848]  It's just that the hydrants cut, like, so many heads that you don't even know where to swing at.
[02:57:19.868 --> 02:57:22.991]  Well, Curtis, that's why you know fluoride is killing you.
[02:57:23.291 --> 02:57:24.793]  Get it out of your local water supply.
[02:57:24.853 --> 02:57:25.874]  Get involved locally.
[02:57:25.914 --> 02:57:26.414]  Get it out.
[02:57:26.715 --> 02:57:27.816]  Many cities have prevailed.
[02:57:28.276 --> 02:57:29.577]  You know GMO's hurting you.
[02:57:29.617 --> 02:57:30.138]  Don't do it.
[02:57:30.478 --> 02:57:32.700]  You know big government's the tool they use for control.
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:33.441]  Cut government.
[02:57:33.801 --> 02:57:34.062]  Okay?
[02:57:34.102 --> 02:57:35.223]  It isn't about me.
[02:57:35.283 --> 02:57:37.044]  Let's just say I'm the worst person on earth.
[02:57:37.945 --> 02:57:41.267]  Don't use that as an excuse to not go out and be a leader and take action.
[02:57:41.867 --> 02:57:43.328]  Believe in yourself, okay?
[02:57:43.728 --> 02:57:45.589]  I mean, Curtis, you don't think you're bad, do you?
[02:57:46.229 --> 02:57:51.951]  Well, no, but it's just like, I go to your sponsors and I order from them and I feel like I'm already on a list somewhere.
[02:57:54.052 --> 02:57:56.193]  But again, sir, that's the chilling effect.
[02:57:56.613 --> 02:57:58.014]  Everybody's already on a list.
[02:57:58.414 --> 02:58:00.875]  They're criminally doing, you can't give in to that fear.
[02:58:01.716 --> 02:58:06.178]  They want to scare you with all this surveillance, so you shut up and let them have your way.
[02:58:08.023 --> 02:58:12.186]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you've got to say no to this and break your conditioning.
[02:58:12.666 --> 02:58:18.350]  I mean, I went to a store last night and the people all just look so miserable and beaten down and dumb.
[02:58:18.370 --> 02:58:22.953]  I mean, just wake up and just man up and fire up and get some discernment.
[02:58:23.533 --> 02:58:24.373]  Great job, crew.
[02:58:24.454 --> 02:58:26.215]  We'll be back Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:26.295 --> 02:58:29.056]  Retransmission starts now with KeyInfo and FaultWars.com.
[02:58:30.737 --> 02:58:34.820]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for all
[02:58:38.645 --> 02:58:39.712]  Radio Network.
[02:58:40.174 --> 02:58:42.005]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons.
