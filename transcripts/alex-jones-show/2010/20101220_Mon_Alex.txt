[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.184]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.804 --> 00:00:10.625]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:12.346]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:16.610]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.193]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.406 --> 00:00:25.587]  December 20th, 2010.
[00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:29.848]  Hello and welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:39.352]  Alex is taking a well-deserved break, so I'll be your fill-in host for today, Paul Joseph Watson, editor and writer for PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:40.553 --> 00:00:45.095]  And of course, as ever, we've got a gargantuan amount of news to cover.
[00:00:45.315 --> 00:00:49.197]  We're gonna be going to some of your calls during the course of the broadcast.
[00:00:50.197 --> 00:01:10.720]  And in the second hour we welcome political scientist, former fighter pilot, and of course, editor of the World Affairs Brief, Joel Skousen, to discuss the so-called tax cut legislation, the Wikileaks situation, the latest developments on that, the economy, and much, much more.
[00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:15.023]  But first, some of our top stories today.
[00:01:15.043 --> 00:01:20.647]  And at the moment, there's no story bigger, of course, than the Washington Post.
[00:01:21.028 --> 00:01:28.753]  Gleefully, it seems, reporting that the American people are now all basically Al-Qaeda until proven innocent.
[00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:29.434]  That's right.
[00:01:30.154 --> 00:01:47.052]  The federal, state, and local governments are using methods first inflicted on the populations of Iraq and Afghanistan to, quote, collect information about Americans using the FBI, local police, and state homeland security.
[00:01:47.693 --> 00:01:51.797]  And this is an eight-page article in the Washington Post today.
[00:01:52.958 --> 00:02:10.990]  Which reveals how, you know, to fight the terrorists of course, the terrorists who supposedly attacked us because they hate our freedom, the federal government is now busy using every trick in the book to strip Americans of their constitutional rights and treat them as terrorists.
[00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.795]  Now the headline is, Monitoring America by Dana Priest and William M. Arkin.
[00:02:18.015 --> 00:02:19.556]  This is the Washington Post.
[00:02:20.336 --> 00:02:22.598]  From Afghanistan to Tennessee.
[00:02:23.438 --> 00:02:30.462]  On a recent night in Memphis, a patrol car rolled slowly through a parking lot in a run-down section of town.
[00:02:30.922 --> 00:02:44.389]  The military-grade infrared camera on its hood moved robotically from left to right, snapping digital images of one license plate after another and analyzing each almost instantly.
[00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:49.692]  Suddenly, a red light flashed on the car's screen along with the word, WARRANT.
[00:02:50.692 --> 00:02:51.736]  Got a live one!
[00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:52.438]  Let's do it!
[00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:53.663]  And Officer called out.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:19.733]  And it goes on in this Washington Post article to list all these different technologies, mobile biometric fingerprint readers, biometric face scanning cameras, and of course we know about the mobile radiation scanner trucks, all of which were used against suspected terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan, which are now being used against innocent Americans.
[00:03:20.874 --> 00:03:29.198]  And the question to come out of all this, because of course listeners to this show will largely know all this information to begin with, but why are they throwing it in our faces?
[00:03:30.518 --> 00:03:41.263]  And why is the Washington Post, the, you know, the biggest establishment mouthpiece in America, supposedly lifting the lid to reveal this surveillance panopticon?
[00:03:42.804 --> 00:03:44.965]  Well A, it is to throw it in your face.
[00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:50.285]  But, moreover, it's the process of learned helplessness.
[00:03:51.086 --> 00:04:05.719]  And this is indoctrinating Americans to accept that the government's reading your emails, that they're reading your instant messages, listening to your phone conversations, they know what websites you're visiting, and that there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.521]  It's learned helplessness.
[00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:10.263]  Training people how to be good slaves.
[00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:15.259]  And of course, it's all in the name of stopping the terrorists.
[00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:30.129]  The same terrorists who, in every single case we've documented since 9-11, are always entrapped by FBI informants and literally handed the bombs, handed the explosives to carry out their deeds.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:39.682]  So as long as, you know, your conversations, your emails and the websites you visit don't betray any signs of terrorism, then you have nothing to worry about.
[00:04:39.702 --> 00:04:40.823]  You can go back to sleep.
[00:04:41.663 --> 00:04:50.605]  But of course there's a problem, because what you consider to be terrorism isn't necessarily the same definition of what the federal government considers to be terrorism.
[00:04:50.906 --> 00:04:55.167]  And we'll explore this further after the break on the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:04:55.187 --> 00:04:55.747]  Stay tuned.

[00:06:59.542 --> 00:07:03.004]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.

[00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:17.551]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:07:18.292 --> 00:07:21.794]  Not worried about them moving south.
[00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:25.435]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:07:28.078 --> 00:07:32.603]  I'm looking for America.
[00:07:32.783 --> 00:07:35.486]  Wear American and be proud.

[00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:05.700]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.441]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.141 --> 00:08:09.262]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:09.902 --> 00:08:10.723]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.483 --> 00:08:12.984]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.024 --> 00:08:16.886]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.226 --> 00:08:21.329]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.212]  It's the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:08:26.332 --> 00:08:28.513]  I'm your fill-in host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:08:29.174 --> 00:08:38.740]  Now, we were talking about, before the break, the fact that the Washington Post wants you to know that Big Sis is monitoring America for your safety.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:51.889]  And now part of their eyes and ears in monitoring America are trash collectors, truck drivers, Walmart shoppers, and things like, you know, Big Sis' see something,
[00:08:52.589 --> 00:08:53.910]  Say Something Program.
[00:08:54.471 --> 00:08:57.474]  They're the people who are now monitoring America for terrorists.
[00:08:57.934 --> 00:09:03.759]  The crack terrorist hunters are now the garbage collectors in your local community.
[00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:05.721]  I bet that makes you feel very safe.
[00:09:07.143 --> 00:09:08.183]  So we got Big Sis.
[00:09:08.984 --> 00:09:10.466]  If you see something, say something.
[00:09:10.486 --> 00:09:11.787]  Well, I'll tell you what I see.
[00:09:12.387 --> 00:09:15.590]  I see a decaying banana republic.
[00:09:16.491 --> 00:09:23.918]  Which is following the path of every other dictatorship in history, be it, you know, ruthless or blundering.
[00:09:25.453 --> 00:09:31.777]  I see people being brainwashed every time they turn on the television and watch CSI Miami.
[00:09:32.437 --> 00:09:40.381]  You know, every time you turn on the radio and there's an ad council commercial telling people to report suspicious activity.
[00:09:41.462 --> 00:09:52.408]  And of course, again, it's all for our safety, just like it was for the safety of those in the former East Germany to have their neighbours recruited as spies for the state to keep an eye on them.
[00:09:54.281 --> 00:10:06.071]  I mean, ask yourself the question, why did the communist-controlled government of East Germany recruit thousands of ordinary citizens as domestic informants?
[00:10:07.052 --> 00:10:10.835]  Because, primarily, they wanted to incarcerate political dissidents.
[00:10:12.572 --> 00:10:17.654]  And prevent people from trying to escape beyond the Berlin Wall.
[00:10:17.854 --> 00:10:23.677]  This was a physical imprisonment that political dissidents in East Germany were trying to escape from.
[00:10:24.677 --> 00:10:34.522]  But in the 21st century, it's all about preventing Americans from escaping from the psychological Berlin Wall that is erected
[00:10:35.646 --> 00:10:41.371]  to prevent them from seeing the truth behind this, you know, concrete structure of lies.
[00:10:42.372 --> 00:10:55.004]  And so long as this psychological Berlin Wall is projected in the human consciousness through these terror threats and the danger of your neighbor turning you in for
[00:10:55.805 --> 00:11:19.057]  You know, flying an American flag, handing out DVDs, talking about the Constitution, talking about corruption in government, all of which, in the MIAC report and many others that we've covered here on the show and on the websites, the law enforcement agencies and Homeland Security now define as domestic extremism and terrorism.
[00:11:20.745 --> 00:11:22.608]  This is about chilling free speech.
[00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:36.367]  It's about making people afraid to talk about any of this in their emails, phone conversations, and through the information they get from visiting websites such as prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:11:38.513 --> 00:11:45.480]  And this whole Monitoring America apparatus has nothing to do with finding terrorists.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.663]  In every single case, the terrorists are entrapped.
[00:11:49.164 --> 00:11:52.567]  The terror plots are contrived, if not outright staged.
[00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:56.531]  We've documented that in triplicate on every occasion.
[00:11:57.832 --> 00:12:01.316]  But it's got everything to do, this Monitoring America program,
[00:12:02.796 --> 00:12:15.924]  With implanting this psychological Berlin Wall in the minds of Americans and through fear preventing them from ever attempting to escape from the prison planet and also helping others to do the same.
[00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:21.388]  It's kind of like the cave allegory which we posted on the website on Sunday.
[00:12:22.368 --> 00:12:25.010]  If you click on the featured stories archive
[00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:31.887]  Then you'll be able to watch this video, which is, um, Plato's Allegory of the Cave.
[00:12:32.588 --> 00:12:39.891]  And it's about four human beings sat chained in a cave, and they're watching a projection on the wall.
[00:12:40.611 --> 00:12:48.855]  And on this projection, the different shadows dance across it, um, that are the choosing of the masters that keep the people enslaved in this cave.
[00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:53.037]  So, while the people in the cave only ever see the shadows,
[00:12:54.031 --> 00:12:59.753]  Anyone who actually succeeds in escaping from that cave actually sees reality as it truly is.
[00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:15.417]  But because those people are so indoctrinated to only ever seeing the shadows and thinking that, you know, their lives would end if they ever saw beyond them, then they in fact persecute the people who have become enlightened and who have escaped from their own enslavement.
[00:13:16.738 --> 00:13:31.903]  And that plays into what we're seeing with this Monitor America program, because as in the former East Germany, and indeed in Nazi Germany, it was all about breeding distrust, turning ordinary citizens against each other.
[00:13:32.623 --> 00:13:44.727]  And as Robert Galately, the Florida University professor, found in his study of these informant snitch programs, which are now coming to America, during
[00:13:46.187 --> 00:13:49.489]  the 1930s and early 1940s in Nazi Germany.
[00:13:51.630 --> 00:14:05.676]  The people who reported on their neighbors did so hardly ever out of genuine security concerns and indeed it never improved security one iota which demolishes that justification immediately.
[00:14:06.397 --> 00:14:12.860]  What this Florida University professor found was that people would report on their neighbors either for
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:36.466]  career goals so as to get them in legal trouble and jump over them on the career ladder for financial benefit to get rewards from becoming an informant and through this strange Pavlovian psychological need to receive approval and respect from an authority figure.
[00:14:38.297 --> 00:14:48.372]  So, in all three different cases of why people informed on their neighbours, not one of those was because of genuine concerns about they might be a terrorist.
[00:14:49.761 --> 00:14:53.563]  So, in every historical case, this has always turned out the same way.
[00:14:53.703 --> 00:15:16.996]  And yet, now with the big sis Walmart spying campaign, the garbage collectors, you know, looking for crime, looking for terrorists in Albany, New York, and many other areas of the country, now over 10,000 garbage collectors nationwide in America are performing the dual role of terrorist hunters.
[00:15:18.197 --> 00:15:24.243]  And it's all heading in the same direction as we've seen in some of the darkest periods in human history.
[00:15:24.764 --> 00:15:31.190]  That's why I say that it is evidence that America is now a decaying banana republic.
[00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:33.713]  And the only question
[00:15:35.225 --> 00:15:48.548]  Surrounding where it's going in the next 5-10 years is whether it will be this bumbling authoritarian state or whether it will become absolutely ruthless as we saw in Nazi Germany.
[00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:50.589]  That seems to be the only question left.
[00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:57.751]  The fact that it's going towards this firmly authoritarian state is now beyond any doubt.
[00:16:00.342 --> 00:16:03.125]  So that's Monitoring America, Washington Post article.
[00:16:03.325 --> 00:16:05.307]  Eight pages, throwing it in your face.
[00:16:06.128 --> 00:16:08.911]  And it's linked up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:21.083]  In fact, there's an AFP boil-down of what's in it, and that's what we've posted at PrisonPlanet.com, because the actual story is eight pages long, so I encourage you to read it all.
[00:16:22.104 --> 00:16:23.085]  Shifting gears.
[00:16:24.318 --> 00:16:37.961]  Of course, I'm broadcasting to you today from frozen Britain, the country which just ten years ago, global warming alarmists said that children would never see the sight of snow again.
[00:16:37.981 --> 00:16:45.822]  And we've got this quote which we posted on PrisonPlanet.com today in a flashback article.
[00:16:45.842 --> 00:16:48.683]  This is from March 2000, over ten years ago.
[00:16:51.172 --> 00:16:57.136]  Britain's winter ends tomorrow with further indications of a striking environmental change.
[00:16:57.576 --> 00:17:00.639]  Snow is starting to disappear from our lives.
[00:17:01.359 --> 00:17:04.541]  That's what the global warming alarmists were saying 10 years ago.
[00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:06.283]  And in this article...
[00:17:07.263 --> 00:17:21.992]  He quotes the infamous CRU Climate Research Centre, which was the epicentre of the Climategate scandal, and one Mr David Viner, who stated, quote, children just aren't going to know what snow is.
[00:17:24.519 --> 00:17:33.566]  That's a little odd, Mr Viner, because ten years later I can look out my window and there's an awful lot of the white stuff around today.
[00:17:33.586 --> 00:17:37.149]  Heathrow Airport closed two days running.
[00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:39.291]  Britain paralysed.
[00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:41.192]  Deluged by snow.
[00:17:41.512 --> 00:17:44.795]  Coldest December in recorded history.
[00:17:45.195 --> 00:17:48.578]  Coldest temperature for decades measured at minus 26 degrees.
[00:17:51.385 --> 00:18:11.995]  And yet, the establishment media still gives discredited cranks, like Mr. Viner, who ten years ago said that it would never snow again in Britain, a platform to disseminate their vehemently debunked propaganda over and over again, as we recently saw with the Cancun Summit.
[00:18:13.316 --> 00:18:19.199]  Now, in this article, which was out the London Independent written ten years ago, the alarmists say that
[00:18:20.339 --> 00:18:23.783]  Global warming will cause milder winters in Britain.
[00:18:23.983 --> 00:18:24.564]  Remember that.
[00:18:24.644 --> 00:18:27.468]  They said global warming would cause milder winters.
[00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.274]  Now, of course, ten years later, they say that...
[00:18:33.416 --> 00:18:35.477]  Freezing is part of the warming.
[00:18:36.137 --> 00:18:48.003]  Even as Britain experiences its coldest winter on record, coldest December on record, the global warming hierarchy are just saying, yeah, that freezing is part of the global warming.
[00:18:48.303 --> 00:18:54.425]  And if you repeat that ridiculous assertion enough times, then the idiots might start to believe it.
[00:18:55.226 --> 00:18:57.567]  But let's look at the actual facts behind this.
[00:18:59.994 --> 00:19:08.778]  They say that Britain is being battered with this big chill, the global warming alarmists do, because, you know, the Gulf Stream is malfunctioning.
[00:19:09.198 --> 00:19:12.720]  And again, the Gulf Stream is malfunctioning, and that's man's fault.
[00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:17.655]  But there's a problem because that little scam doesn't work anymore for them.
[00:19:18.355 --> 00:19:34.033]  Both NASA and the Met Office, which is basically the CRU discredited climate gate crooks, in their own studies have now had to admit that their data on the Gulf Stream was completely inaccurate and that the Gulf Stream is unaffected.
[00:19:35.114 --> 00:19:38.617]  But whether it's hotter or colder, for them it doesn't matter.
[00:19:38.797 --> 00:19:41.039]  It's all proof of man-made global warming.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.862]  Freezing is now part of the warming.
[00:19:44.222 --> 00:19:46.124]  Any weather is man's fault.
[00:19:46.484 --> 00:19:58.675]  And they will use it to ram through and exploit their agenda of complete regulation and control over your life through carbon taxes and the genocidal move towards the end game.
[00:19:59.375 --> 00:20:00.135]  We're gonna come back.
[00:20:00.596 --> 00:20:04.497]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[00:20:04.757 --> 00:20:08.678]  That something is Atwood Rope, the highest quality rope made in the USA.
[00:20:08.738 --> 00:20:14.340]  From exotic braids for military, rescue, arborists, shipyards, tow line, or boating.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.062]  Quality rope at affordable prices you and your customers can depend on.

[00:20:23.204 --> 00:20:27.068]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?

[00:22:01.132 --> 00:22:04.755]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:22:05.156 --> 00:22:08.158]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:22:08.398 --> 00:22:13.162]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:13.182 --> 00:22:19.428]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:21.830]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:22.530]  Tim Geithner?
[00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:22.730]  Bernanke?
[00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.111]  They're arsonists!
[00:22:23.171 --> 00:22:23.811]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:23.831 --> 00:22:25.572]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:41.263 --> 00:22:48.206]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.

[00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.232]  There's a man going around taking names.
[00:24:15.733 --> 00:24:18.995]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[00:24:21.337 --> 00:24:24.178]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.965]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down when the man comes around.
[00:24:35.117 --> 00:24:48.328]  Well, the global warming alarmists have definitely decided who to blame for Britain's coldest December since records began, and that's, of course, man-made climate change.
[00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:58.616]  Ten years ago, they said that snow would disappear from our lives completely, that children would grow up never seeing the sight of snow, and now
[00:25:00.322 --> 00:25:08.069]  Heathrow Airport completely closed, flights cancelled, whole country paralysed from, in places, two feet of snow.
[00:25:08.509 --> 00:25:11.271]  We had another two feet of snow a week ago.
[00:25:11.852 --> 00:25:15.395]  You know, for the past three winters we've been deluged with this stuff.
[00:25:16.255 --> 00:25:22.080]  Maximum record low temperatures recorded for decades, minus 26 degrees.
[00:25:23.261 --> 00:25:26.204]  And of course, that's all proof of global warming.
[00:25:27.677 --> 00:25:30.560]  Now notice, that's what they're still claiming!
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:44.993]  Notice that whenever man-made global warming sceptics point to, um, you know, the coldest December in Britain since records began as evidence for global cooling, the, uh,
[00:25:46.064 --> 00:25:49.908]  Alarmists proudly proclaim, oh but that's just the weather!
[00:25:50.148 --> 00:25:54.452]  You know, we're talking about climate models measured over a hundred years.
[00:25:55.013 --> 00:26:00.178]  You know, you can't quantify global warming by using the data from one single weather event.
[00:26:01.462 --> 00:26:02.523]  Well it's funny that, isn't it?
[00:26:02.563 --> 00:26:20.796]  Because whenever there's a hot weather event, like Russia experienced in the summer just gone, that also caused the Pakistani floods, the Global Warming Alarmist immediately sees upon that weather event, which they say can't be used to prove global warming one way or another.
[00:26:21.869 --> 00:26:23.550]  As evidence of global warming.
[00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:32.618]  Again, any weather, tornadoes, record freezing, sizzling hot summer temperatures, floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, just anything.
[00:26:33.218 --> 00:26:37.521]  That's all never happened before in the natural geological history of the planet.
[00:26:38.102 --> 00:26:41.004]  It's only just started to happen and it's all our fault.
[00:26:41.224 --> 00:26:49.010]  So we've got to pay carbon taxes to Al Gore and to the massive climate exchanges that they profit in the hundreds of millions of dollars from.
[00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:50.512]  Again.
[00:26:51.772 --> 00:26:52.872]  Get it, get it into your head.
[00:26:53.073 --> 00:26:54.873]  Freezing is part of the warming.
[00:26:54.953 --> 00:26:55.854]  Do you understand?
[00:26:56.254 --> 00:26:57.054]  Black is white.
[00:26:59.795 --> 00:27:11.099]  Now, another thing they're coming out with, again, the more discredited they become, the more ridiculously stupid and bold their proclamations are.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.742]  They're now saying that 2010 is the hottest year since records began.
[00:27:18.242 --> 00:27:22.865]  And this myth is being promulgated by Dr. James Hansen of NASA.
[00:27:23.245 --> 00:27:35.693]  This is the guy who gave glowing approvals to books written by fellow alarmists that call for environmental terrorism, blowing up bridges, and returning man to the Stone Age.
[00:27:35.753 --> 00:27:38.435]  That's a good idea to save the planet, obviously.
[00:27:39.415 --> 00:27:40.556]  Again, 2010, so-called hottest year ever.
[00:27:44.946 --> 00:27:45.906]  Since records began.
[00:27:46.226 --> 00:27:47.927]  Total fabrication.
[00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:56.689]  Three studies said that global temperatures had cooled by 0.3 degrees Celsius in 2010.
[00:27:57.429 --> 00:28:07.091]  One study, the one led by Hanson, said that global temperatures in 2010 had increased by 0.2 degrees Celsius.
[00:28:07.471 --> 00:28:14.053]  Now the funny thing about it is that as Anthony Watts over at What's Up with that, the premier
[00:28:14.773 --> 00:28:31.298]  Global Warming Skeptic website, along with Mark Morano's Climate Depot, proves 75% of the temperature data that Hanson used to proclaim that this was the hottest year on record was completely contrived.
[00:28:31.618 --> 00:28:33.939]  Oh, is that any surprise with these people?
[00:28:34.339 --> 00:28:35.679]  You know, hide the decline.
[00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:37.360]  These are the Climategate crooks.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.101]  That twist the data to suit their own agenda.
[00:28:41.541 --> 00:28:48.124]  And basically, they didn't even have 75% of the temperature data in, so they just basically made it up.
[00:28:49.505 --> 00:28:52.366]  And you've got these three other studies saying the opposite.
[00:28:53.066 --> 00:28:58.809]  And guess which one the Associated Press and the establishment media chose to give traction to?
[00:29:00.209 --> 00:29:05.391]  To the other three studies that all agreed that global temperatures had significantly dipped by 0.3 degrees.
[00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:13.425]  No, of course they went for the manufactured, contrived 75% data one, which said that...
[00:29:15.393 --> 00:29:19.694]  Temperatures have increased by 0.2% and this was the hottest year on record.
[00:29:19.894 --> 00:29:20.194]  Why?
[00:29:20.454 --> 00:29:30.756]  Because obviously it backs up their global warming myth that they're now fully invested in and that it's being used to push towards your total enslavement and the lowering of your living standards.
[00:29:31.277 --> 00:29:36.198]  We'll be back with Ted Anderson and more news and your thoughts after the break.
[00:29:36.958 --> 00:29:40.539]  PrisonPlanet.tv, stay tuned for the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.569]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.512 --> 00:29:57.181]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.323]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.623 --> 00:30:04.903]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.543 --> 00:30:08.685]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.966 --> 00:30:09.526]  Number 2.
[00:30:09.826 --> 00:30:14.369]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.729 --> 00:30:15.170]  It's true.
[00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:20.033]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.333 --> 00:30:20.873]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.153 --> 00:30:24.455]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.756 --> 00:30:28.438]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.658 --> 00:30:29.199]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.439 --> 00:30:31.821]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.201 --> 00:30:35.585]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.885 --> 00:30:36.105]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.686 --> 00:30:40.609]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.829 --> 00:30:45.594]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:32:10.281 --> 00:32:17.387]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.

[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:43.949]  It's the Alex Jones Show, and everybody wants to rule the world, and the bankers certainly want to rule over the control and manipulation of precious metals.
[00:33:43.989 --> 00:33:56.200]  We're about to go to Ted Anderson, but this revolution against the bankers with Americans across the country buying physical silver is really starting to catch fire.
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.703]  We're going to go to a clip now, Ted Anderson after this clip.
[00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:02.442]  You're watching Why Silver.
[00:34:03.043 --> 00:34:03.483]  Why now?
[00:34:04.364 --> 00:34:09.389]  Never in the history of mankind has one nation engaged in such a rapid descent.
[00:34:09.549 --> 00:34:13.413]  In 1980, the United States was the world's largest creditor nation.
[00:34:13.673 --> 00:34:18.718]  Today, it's the largest debtor not only in the world, but in the history of the world.
[00:34:19.238 --> 00:34:22.823]  We have witnessed massive corruption across all areas of society.
[00:34:23.063 --> 00:34:31.013]  From the Enron scandal, to Bernie Madoff, to trillions missing from the Pentagon as Donald Rumsfeld publicly admitted on September 10th, 2001.
[00:34:31.593 --> 00:34:37.661]  The aim of this micro-doc is to help everyone not only recognize how dire the situation has become for America,
[00:34:37.901 --> 00:34:45.006]  But also to help you understand that there is something you can do today in order to provide some measure of protection for you and your family.
[00:34:45.386 --> 00:34:46.467]  So here are the facts.
[00:34:46.887 --> 00:34:54.192]  The corruption in our financial markets has been so widespread for so long that it has actually created opportunity for the properly informed.
[00:34:54.492 --> 00:35:05.139]  Because the Federal Reserve owns the printing presses which pump out our paper dollars, the controlling class has for years suppressed the free market prices of gold and silver in order to keep their paper dollars unrivaled.
[00:35:05.399 --> 00:35:11.306]  Yet, like a canary in a coal mine, the rising prices of gold and silver are signaling that something is wrong.
[00:35:11.526 --> 00:35:20.997]  So the bankers have flooded the market with paper representations of gold and silver in a coordinated scheme to keep those prices down, thus keeping that canary alive.
[00:35:21.587 --> 00:35:26.248]  And people will say, well there is, and you've heard it today, there's not that much physical metal out there.
[00:35:26.509 --> 00:35:26.969]  There isn't.
[00:35:27.409 --> 00:35:32.910]  But in the physical market, as the market uses that term, there is much more metal than that.
[00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:34.571]  There's a hundred times what there is.
[00:35:35.211 --> 00:35:36.592]  But it's no longer working.
[00:35:36.752 --> 00:35:38.272]  The bankers are losing the battle.
[00:35:38.692 --> 00:35:47.255]  Precious metals are financial assets, and like currencies and T-bills and T-bonds, they trade in the multiples of a hundred times the underlying physical.
[00:35:48.055 --> 00:35:54.983]  Investors and hedge fund vigilantes around the world now know about the banker scheme and the result is nothing short of revolutionary.
[00:35:55.343 --> 00:36:01.050]  People from all walks of life around the world are now buying physical gold and silver and rejecting the paper metal.
[00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.811]  I own physical silver.
[00:36:03.152 --> 00:36:03.833]  Physical silver.
[00:36:04.133 --> 00:36:05.815]  I own physical silver.
[00:36:06.195 --> 00:36:07.176]  Physical silver.
[00:36:07.236 --> 00:36:08.416]  I own physical silver.
[00:36:08.737 --> 00:36:09.617]  I own physical.
[00:36:09.997 --> 00:36:17.682]  Add to that even a few nation states actively acquiring physical metal, and it all adds up to yet another paper Ponzi scheme collapsing.
[00:36:18.082 --> 00:36:19.703]  This one built of paper metal.
[00:36:19.943 --> 00:36:24.466]  What is happening right now is causing this decades-long scheme to unravel.
[00:36:24.606 --> 00:36:29.609]  And when it's fully exposed, it will prove to be the biggest financial fraud in world history.
[00:36:30.149 --> 00:36:35.193]  So, if you purchased silver a year or two ago and you've doubled your money, do you sell now?
[00:36:35.714 --> 00:36:38.796]  If you're new to this and don't own any, do you buy?
[00:36:39.237 --> 00:36:40.578]  Well, here are the facts.
[00:36:40.938 --> 00:36:41.498]  You decide.
[00:36:41.919 --> 00:36:49.365]  The industrial demand for silver has been growing year in and year out, draining some 800 million ounces of physical silver from world markets every year.
[00:36:49.625 --> 00:36:56.494]  With a worldwide mining production only providing approximately 550 million ounces per year, you can see the problem.
[00:36:56.774 --> 00:37:01.320]  The United States government owned 2 billion ounces of silver in 1990.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.142]  Today, it has zero.
[00:37:03.442 --> 00:37:07.487]  There is not enough physical silver to meet industrial demand or investor demand.
[00:37:07.587 --> 00:37:08.028]  In fact,
[00:37:08.248 --> 00:37:13.391]  To re-channel investor interest in silver away from physical and into yet more paper, J.P.
[00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:19.595]  Morgan, the very bank being investigated by the Department of Justice for fraud, created the SLV ETF.
[00:37:19.915 --> 00:37:30.582]  A paper tiger, which according to the esteemed Harvey Organ and other researchers like this one who have read the SLV prospectus, the SLV listed on the NYSE has no physical silver behind it.
[00:37:30.742 --> 00:37:32.843]  And when the paper ponzi finally collapses,
[00:37:33.223 --> 00:37:39.608]  Those holding paper representations of silver through the SLV will find they are listed as unsecured creditors.
[00:37:40.368 --> 00:37:41.509]  So what does it all mean?
[00:37:41.969 --> 00:37:43.270]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:37:43.871 --> 00:37:48.794]  Orwell said, in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:37:49.114 --> 00:37:51.576]  We are now living in a time of massive deceit.
[00:37:51.796 --> 00:37:57.400]  Americans are quickly losing confidence in their financial markets, in their media, and in their government.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:02.625]  And the creditor nations to whom we owe trillions are starting to lose confidence in our dollar.
[00:38:03.046 --> 00:38:04.327]  So why physical silver?
[00:38:05.088 --> 00:38:06.589]  The reasons are obvious.
[00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.911]  The next steps are yours.
[00:38:10.293 --> 00:38:11.174]  Thanks for watching.
[00:38:11.554 --> 00:38:12.255]  Why silver?
[00:38:12.695 --> 00:38:13.116]  Why now?
[00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:33.735]  And there you have it, I mean, we've got the globalists at every turn, JP Morgan, George Soros, trying to badmouth gold and silver while pumping out these paper instruments to artificially suppress the price so they can ultimately hoard all the physical supplies.
[00:38:34.675 --> 00:38:37.658]  But we've got Ted Anderson joining us now.
[00:38:38.299 --> 00:38:40.801]  Ted, I mean, the jig's up, isn't it?
[00:38:40.921 --> 00:38:57.797]  I mean, as a result of this campaign led by Max Keiser and others, we've got JP Morgan having to publicly reduce their position in silver, and this backdoor manipulation of precious metals is really starting to be pushed out into the open.
[00:38:58.717 --> 00:39:12.221]  Well, it sure has become more widely known that the central banks of the world have been manipulating gold and silver, trying to suppress the prices and trying to support their fiat currency.
[00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:18.683]  You've got to remember JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, even Wells Fargo, they're all member banks of the Federal Reserve.
[00:39:18.963 --> 00:39:19.643]  It's a cartel.
[00:39:20.343 --> 00:39:27.227]  Not a whole lot different than the cartels you watch in the movie when you're looking at the gangster flicks.
[00:39:27.407 --> 00:39:28.188]  It's a cartel.
[00:39:28.228 --> 00:39:33.671]  These people control currencies and they want to continue to maintain that control.
[00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:38.433]  And as people buy gold and silver and start trading that amongst each other as
[00:39:39.694 --> 00:39:40.034]  I think?
[00:39:59.299 --> 00:40:13.716]  and uh... they get to collect interest from the entire nation and really they're trying to build it into the entire world so we all labor for them like slaves off of something that they create from nothing you know it's it's no it's no question of you know it's no doubt that the uh...
[00:40:14.136 --> 00:40:19.078]  The United States debt problem evolved from the Federal Reserve System and their cartel.
[00:40:19.458 --> 00:40:25.541]  And the same thing is true in London with the Bank of England and all these different banks across the entire world.
[00:40:25.801 --> 00:40:34.304]  For some reason in 1913, we decided to go to this fiat money system where we have bankers that are creating currency.
[00:40:37.085 --> 00:40:45.590]  It just, it simply took the power from the hands of the people and handed it over to this elite group and they fight amongst each other and so on and so forth.
[00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:49.793]  But I can tell you one thing for sure, they all have the same common denominator.
[00:40:49.813 --> 00:40:59.478]  They all want to see the United States dollar and the currencies of the world stay in control and not see gold and silver take back over what it used to have previous to 1913.
[00:41:01.079 --> 00:41:06.288]  Uh, or going all the way up to 1971 here in the United States where Nixon took us off the gold standard.
[00:41:06.708 --> 00:41:10.534]  But, you know, right now the French are losing their triple-A grade rating.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.821]  on their bonds, on their debt.
[00:41:13.561 --> 00:41:15.622]  They're going to be a subclass now.
[00:41:15.682 --> 00:41:25.507]  It's like, you know, we've got this erosion of the monetary system in Europe, and the French are the next in line to fail.
[00:41:25.607 --> 00:41:34.711]  You know, we've seen, first of all, we've seen the Greek crises, and now it's spread to the United Kingdom, and in that area now France.
[00:41:35.251 --> 00:41:42.257]  So, you know, and the funny thing is the United States dollar is gaining some strength because of it, but the United States dollar is in a free fall.
[00:41:42.277 --> 00:41:46.920]  It just means that the French currency is falling faster, which is obviously the euro.
[00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:53.425]  The French currency is falling faster than the United States dollar and propping up the dollar in the process.
[00:41:53.925 --> 00:41:55.326]  It's so crazy, this whole thing.
[00:41:55.667 --> 00:41:56.908]  But we're talking about silver.
[00:41:57.648 --> 00:41:58.289]  I tell you, Paul.
[00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:08.295]  The best thing that people can do, and I'm not kidding about this, I mean there's so many people that are out there going, well I can't afford silver, I don't know what I can do.
[00:42:09.796 --> 00:42:14.319]  I put together a package that just makes it absolutely so easy to buy.
[00:42:14.979 --> 00:42:26.242]  I mean, $97, I'm delivering three silver dollars, and these are the silver dollars that were used here in this country as constitutional money between 1776 all the way up till 1964.
[00:42:27.022 --> 00:42:38.225]  I'm talking about the real silver money that was intended by our forefathers here in the United States for us to use so the government doesn't have the printing press and do what they're doing right now.
[00:42:39.165 --> 00:42:43.786]  And those three silver dollars, I match them with three of Alex's best videos.
[00:42:44.346 --> 00:42:53.852]  The Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, and Endgame all tied together in one package where you can get the videos and these are not copies of the videos.
[00:42:53.892 --> 00:43:08.922]  I've been to several of these functions like 9-11 events and so on and so forth where people are handing out videos and they make copies and put them in a paper sleeve and they tell people to watch this video and on the front of it you'll see a marker that says Endgame on it.
[00:43:10.583 --> 00:43:17.545]  These are the ones that are actually sealed in the plastic, brand new videos, brand new productions of the Alex Jones and company.
[00:43:18.165 --> 00:43:21.206]  And I just need to say, people need to be getting involved.
[00:43:21.406 --> 00:43:23.767]  I mean, get away from this fiat money system.
[00:43:23.787 --> 00:43:26.867]  You're actually, by doing so, you're fighting the fight.
[00:43:26.907 --> 00:43:29.968]  You're getting into gold and silver, which was intended for you to use.
[00:43:30.368 --> 00:43:35.990]  The people here in the United States learned an awfully big lesson when the continental currency failed.
[00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:38.531]  And it failed because of the printing press.
[00:43:38.952 --> 00:43:43.115]  And now the United States dollar, the Federal Reserve note, is failing for the same reason.
[00:43:43.155 --> 00:43:45.236]  We've driven ourselves way too far into debt.
[00:43:45.597 --> 00:43:47.498]  We have way too much liability to pay.
[00:43:47.798 --> 00:43:49.920]  There's no way the United States can ever do it.
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.622]  We've sold our children's future, sad as that sounds.
[00:43:53.282 --> 00:43:56.384]  And the only answer to this is to get back to
[00:43:57.265 --> 00:43:58.726]  Precious metals is money.
[00:43:59.587 --> 00:44:02.309]  Take that darn printing press away from our politicians.
[00:44:02.389 --> 00:44:15.458]  We just need to do that because the politicians will continue to invent new legislation and have absolutely no restriction to financially to what they do because they have this darn printing press.
[00:44:15.498 --> 00:44:18.501]  You're going to continue to see bad ideas come out of Washington, D.C.
[00:44:19.381 --> 00:44:24.484]  And put our children further on the hook, and until that printing press is gone, this is going to go this way.
[00:44:24.844 --> 00:44:32.508]  And with the printing press, you also have to end this cartel of the Federal Reserve Bank and its bank branches.
[00:44:32.908 --> 00:44:40.511]  You know, you're in Europe, and I don't even know how you're going to start to end that Rothschild bank they call the Bank of England.
[00:44:41.132 --> 00:44:47.335]  But here in the United States, we have a Constitution that clearly describes that we should be using gold and silver as money.
[00:44:48.157 --> 00:44:50.818]  The founding father said that this is how this should be.
[00:44:51.359 --> 00:44:58.702]  Gold and silver coins, and left to the power of the state to coin that, to coin gold and silver coins as money.
[00:44:58.762 --> 00:45:12.429]  As soon as we got away from that, it was a treasonous act, and the people that decided to set up this Federal Reserve System actually had to travel incognito, not even using their own names, to meet down in Jekyll Island to get this thing going.
[00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:14.450]  It just absolutely stinks.
[00:45:15.431 --> 00:45:15.811]  I think?
[00:45:32.199 --> 00:45:33.300]  Two, two, three, seven.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:33.600]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:33.701]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:45:33.741 --> 00:45:35.843]  You can also ask for the Frank offer for $304.
[00:45:35.943 --> 00:45:38.225]  That gets a full year subscription to Bob Chapman's newsletter.
[00:45:38.265 --> 00:45:41.709]  And we have the British Sovereign at $380 and you get five videos for that.
[00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:42.349]  I mean, it's just...
[00:45:54.702 --> 00:45:57.144]  You know, people need to get involved with the precious metals.
[00:45:57.164 --> 00:45:59.106]  They need to get away from this fiat system.
[00:45:59.547 --> 00:46:06.133]  By taking fiat money, you're supporting the very cause that's taken down this country.
[00:46:07.737 --> 00:46:12.861]  And Ted, is this offer just over the phone or is it on MidasResources.com as well?
[00:46:13.242 --> 00:46:15.323]  Well, you're going to find it on MidasResources.com.
[00:46:15.363 --> 00:46:17.425]  You're going to find it on Infowars.com.
[00:46:17.445 --> 00:46:20.487]  You can certainly call the 800 number and get it that way.
[00:46:20.507 --> 00:46:23.029]  You can go to GCNlive.com and click there.
[00:46:25.011 --> 00:46:30.535]  The easiest way to make it simple is just dial 1-800-686-2237.
[00:46:30.815 --> 00:46:32.276]  We will accept your credit card.
[00:46:32.296 --> 00:46:33.657]  You can mail in a check.
[00:46:34.077 --> 00:46:39.881]  If you want us to do an ACH, you can just give us the numbers off your check and we'll have it automatically drawn out.
[00:46:40.481 --> 00:46:41.802]  What a great gift!
[00:46:42.243 --> 00:46:43.383]  You know, holiday gift idea.
[00:46:43.403 --> 00:46:47.987]  I realize there's not enough time between now and Christmas to get it to you there, but who cares?
[00:46:48.047 --> 00:46:49.207]  A late Christmas present.
[00:46:49.688 --> 00:46:50.548]  You know, why not?
[00:46:50.889 --> 00:46:53.130]  You know, get yourself involved in the precious metals.
[00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:53.931]  There's a reason
[00:46:54.631 --> 00:47:11.458]  Why, you know, Hamilton and Jefferson and Jackson and all these, you know, the people that actually fought to give us our freedom and our liberty and here we let it, you know, just get taken away from us.
[00:47:11.538 --> 00:47:18.021]  I mean, we're slaves to a cartel, to a system that's not even a form of our government.
[00:47:18.061 --> 00:47:19.081]  It's privately held.
[00:47:19.481 --> 00:47:22.703]  They get to create something and siphon off your labor for it.
[00:47:24.024 --> 00:47:26.746]  It's depleting the assets of the United States of America.
[00:47:26.766 --> 00:47:27.988]  It just shouldn't be this way.
[00:47:28.008 --> 00:47:29.269]  And it doesn't have to be this way.
[00:47:29.289 --> 00:47:30.730]  It wasn't designed to be this way.
[00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:35.094]  It is absolutely unconstitutional that we've gone where we have.
[00:47:35.795 --> 00:47:38.638]  The Federal Reserve Act was not a constitutional amendment.
[00:47:39.585 --> 00:47:47.048]  That means that it does not override the mandate of the Constitution that says that we should be using gold and silver as money.
[00:47:47.708 --> 00:47:58.633]  But yet, here it is, because they're so powerful, they have their hands in the pockets of our politicians so deeply, that they're able to get away with something that's absolutely unconstitutional.
[00:48:00.652 --> 00:48:01.613]  Okay, thanks Ted.
[00:48:01.653 --> 00:48:04.716]  That's Ted Anderson, MidasResources.com.
[00:48:05.336 --> 00:48:06.918]  And I mean, that's a really good idea.
[00:48:06.958 --> 00:48:19.990]  I mean, last year for Christmas I got a one-ounce silver coin and you can get the presentation box and it just makes a better gift and it's something of real value than buying something that somebody doesn't want, doesn't need.
[00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:22.631]  So that's MidasResources.com.
[00:48:23.391 --> 00:48:25.072]  Take advantage of that great offer.
[00:48:26.252 --> 00:48:27.492]  Thanks to Ted Anderson.
[00:48:28.453 --> 00:48:29.953]  Quick call before the break.
[00:48:30.133 --> 00:48:31.854]  Let's go to Ben in Texas.
[00:48:31.914 --> 00:48:32.734]  Ben, you're on the air.
[00:48:32.754 --> 00:48:34.675]  Hey Paul, how are you doing?
[00:48:34.735 --> 00:48:37.176]  I just wanted to say I applaud what you're doing.
[00:48:37.196 --> 00:48:46.639]  Speaking out about government abuse of power and public deceit, I wish the public would use your analogy of the allegory of the cave.
[00:48:47.637 --> 00:48:47.737]  I'm
[00:49:04.784 --> 00:49:06.766]  A false accusation against me.
[00:49:09.308 --> 00:49:14.532]  Submit a document to the court accusing me of something that wasn't true.
[00:49:14.552 --> 00:49:20.497]  Then CPS took my newborn daughter, placed her in my brother's custody.
[00:49:21.898 --> 00:49:25.041]  This was all made on false grounds.
[00:49:25.141 --> 00:49:26.502]  Placed her in my brother's custody.
[00:49:28.183 --> 00:49:29.684]  They gave me three days to decide this.
[00:49:32.777 --> 00:49:34.158]  She was in my brother's custody.
[00:49:34.758 --> 00:49:36.439]  I told CPS I didn't want her there.
[00:49:36.499 --> 00:49:39.981]  She was, you know, they were using drugs and alcohol.
[00:49:40.001 --> 00:49:41.382]  It was an unsafe environment.
[00:49:42.022 --> 00:49:44.244]  Two weeks later, she died.
[00:49:45.304 --> 00:49:48.866]  And this is all because state officials are fabricating sworn documents.
[00:49:49.487 --> 00:49:56.491]  And, you know, the CPS system is not only a pedophilia playground, it's a government cash cow.
[00:49:57.131 --> 00:49:59.892]  And the state doesn't have the public's
[00:50:01.921 --> 00:50:08.667]  Uh, protection in mind that they care about protecting themselves, and that's what it's coming for more and more every day.
[00:50:08.687 --> 00:50:25.442]  And you've got this judge down here in Travis County signing these willy-nilly orders, Judge Byrne, and no one is there to oversee how she's violating federal constitutional rights of due process and so forth.
[00:50:25.462 --> 00:50:28.704]  And I just want to say that, and I just want to say I applaud what you're doing.
[00:50:28.724 --> 00:50:29.165]  Thank you.
[00:50:30.197 --> 00:50:30.998]  Okay, thanks, Ben.
[00:50:31.458 --> 00:50:33.940]  Yeah, I mean, it's all part of the Monitor America program.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:42.707]  You've got ad council ads encouraging people to report people for child abuse, and they say, even though there's no evidence, just report them anyway.
[00:50:42.987 --> 00:50:49.332]  You've got fathers being arrested for feeding their kids organic food, for not giving them tap water with fluoride.
[00:50:49.612 --> 00:50:53.535]  And it's just a sadistic cult that preys on this informant society.
[00:50:53.856 --> 00:50:58.920]  And that's what big cysts, that's what big government wants, is the population feeding on each other.
[00:51:01.027 --> 00:51:05.490]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:51:58.826 --> 00:52:02.689]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:02.749 --> 00:52:04.971]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.071 --> 00:52:07.834]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.274 --> 00:52:13.018]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.378 --> 00:52:17.582]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.882 --> 00:52:20.205]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.225 --> 00:52:22.749]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:22.769 --> 00:52:25.692]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.033 --> 00:52:33.643]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:33.979 --> 00:52:39.222]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.362 --> 00:52:41.643]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.683 --> 00:52:45.645]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.905 --> 00:52:46.826]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:46.966 --> 00:52:48.287]  You're everyone else.

[00:54:25.086 --> 00:54:29.268]  Father harassed by CPS for feeding kids organic food.
[00:54:29.788 --> 00:54:31.348]  See something, say something.
[00:54:31.729 --> 00:54:37.251]  Neighbours report on man for refusing to make daughters drink tap water or take vaccines.
[00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:40.692]  And this is what the caller was talking about in the previous segment.
[00:54:41.612 --> 00:54:44.253]  This morning I was listening to a US radio show.
[00:54:44.494 --> 00:54:50.176]  In the adverts, an Ad Council commercial produced in association with the government,
[00:54:51.136 --> 00:54:58.782]  It basically said, there doesn't need to be any evidence for you to suspect somebody of child abuse, just report them anyway so we can investigate.
[00:54:59.083 --> 00:55:01.284]  Report your neighbour, it's for the children.
[00:55:02.285 --> 00:55:12.353]  Report them to the government, who then hires armies of TSA thugs to fondle your children, who are later caught with 10,000 child porn images on their computer.
[00:55:12.894 --> 00:55:14.435]  Well, that makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?
[00:55:14.495 --> 00:55:14.675]  Again,
[00:55:15.896 --> 00:55:23.338]  Turning everybody against each other in this starzy, crypto East Germany decaying banana republic.
[00:55:23.898 --> 00:55:28.299]  And one of the primary ways they're targeting us now is through our own children.
[00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:31.499]  Andy in Maryland, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:37.160]  I wanted to talk about what happened to me this weekend.
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:44.982]  I was gathering petition signatures this weekend for the Libertarian Party of Maryland.
[00:55:45.975 --> 00:55:57.465]  In case people are not aware, in this country, in the majority of states, you have to get petition signatures in order to be able to place candidates on the ballot.
[00:55:58.386 --> 00:56:07.534]  And in Maryland, you have to get 10,000 signatures from registered voters in order to have your party qualified for the ballot.
[00:56:08.074 --> 00:56:12.338]  And then, once you get ballot status, you have to get
[00:56:13.382 --> 00:56:38.955]  a certain percent of the vote in the governor's race in order to maintain ballot status and if you don't hit that vote threshold of the governor's race you have to do another petition to re-qualify for the next election cycle and uh... in order to keep your party on the ballot and uh... not lose all of your registered voters that is the people who who checked your party box on the voter registration form
[00:56:41.316 --> 00:56:44.198]  You have to have that petition completed by January 2nd.
[00:56:45.198 --> 00:57:00.027]  So myself and some other people here in the Libertarian Party of Maryland have been gathering these petition signatures, and this weekend I was in a place called Ellicott City, Maryland, which is in Howard County.
[00:57:00.907 --> 00:57:03.188]  And I was in front of a library there, and
[00:57:04.693 --> 00:57:09.715]  The librarian came out and told me that I had to leave, that I couldn't do this there.
[00:57:10.355 --> 00:57:22.480]  Now, I happen to know that we have a legal right to do this, and in fact we have done this at other libraries in Maryland, including in Howard County, and didn't have any problems.
[00:57:23.501 --> 00:57:31.424]  There's also some court rulings that have gone down in our favor, two of which I know of in the state of Maryland.
[00:57:32.585 --> 00:57:37.329]  One of them was a court ruling against the Maryland Transit Authority.
[00:57:38.911 --> 00:57:44.095]  This was on behalf of the group ACORN, which was out doing voter registration drives.
[00:57:45.736 --> 00:57:49.760]  The ACLU of Maryland took their case and they won.
[00:57:50.541 --> 00:57:54.484]  The Maryland Transit Authority was saying that they couldn't do their voter registration activities.
[00:57:55.137 --> 00:58:05.470]  I tried to explain this to the librarian and she wouldn't listen to me and I tried to show her the paperwork and she wouldn't look at my paperwork and then she called the police.
[00:58:14.901 --> 00:58:21.326]  And so the police came out, and the first cop came out, and I told... I showed them the paperwork.
[00:58:21.747 --> 00:58:25.089]  They wouldn't look at it, and I told them, look, I'm supposed to have a legal right to be here.
[00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:27.972]  And the cops said, okay, well, the sergeant's gonna come out.
[00:58:28.112 --> 00:58:31.014]  So... Alright, tell us how the story ends after the break.
[00:58:31.054 --> 00:58:32.416]  Stay tuned, we'll be right back.
[00:58:32.436 --> 00:58:33.717]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:33.917 --> 00:58:35.338]  Joel Skousen coming up live.
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:43.605]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:51.351]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:58:51.411 --> 00:58:58.096]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:58:58.337 --> 00:59:00.638]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:59:00.899 --> 00:59:06.083]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:59:06.263 --> 00:59:09.045]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:59:09.325 --> 00:59:11.387]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:59:11.627 --> 00:59:17.552]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:59:17.872 --> 00:59:21.074]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:59:21.254 --> 00:59:26.778]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:59:27.039 --> 00:59:28.340]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.841]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:59:29.981 --> 00:59:32.503]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:59:32.643 --> 00:59:36.686]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:59:36.866 --> 00:59:38.908]  You can find the video at www.

[00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:42.471]  That's End of America.

[00:59:55.582 --> 00:59:58.365]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.881 --> 01:00:09.063]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.704 --> 01:00:10.524]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.284 --> 01:00:12.245]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.845 --> 01:00:16.467]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.028 --> 01:00:21.090]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.966 --> 01:00:28.791]  Second hour of the Alex Jones Show with me, Paul Joseph Watson, today on this Monday, December 20th.
[01:00:29.391 --> 01:00:40.559]  So, Andy, you're there outside the library, you're on public property, you're collecting signatures for a Libertarian Party election, and the librarian calls the police.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.700]  Tell us how the story ends.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:50.366]  Okay, then the police sergeant came out, and I tried to show the police sergeant the paperwork, which I had the
[01:00:50.891 --> 01:00:52.292]  The ACORN court ruling.
[01:00:52.652 --> 01:00:59.836]  There was also another court ruling in favor of the Lyndon LaRouche supporters against the Maryland Motor Vehicles Place.
[01:01:00.696 --> 01:01:04.458]  And then there's also a federal court ruling called Grown vs. Sang.
[01:01:04.938 --> 01:01:07.439]  And in that federal court ruling, it included libraries.
[01:01:07.519 --> 01:01:08.580]  I tried to show this to them.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.380]  They wouldn't look at it.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:18.385]  I also had a letter from the head of the Howard County Library that said, that acknowledged that we were allowed to collect petition signatures there.
[01:01:18.705 --> 01:01:20.026]  Anyway, they wouldn't look at any of that stuff.
[01:01:20.928 --> 01:01:22.909]  And the police sergeant said that I had to leave.
[01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:24.630]  And I said, OK, fine.
[01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.511]  I'll leave.
[01:01:25.751 --> 01:01:31.314]  But before I go, I just would like to get some evidence of this so I can present it to our attorneys.
[01:01:31.875 --> 01:01:37.658]  And so I told them that I was going to video them telling me to leave on my cell phone.
[01:01:37.678 --> 01:01:38.939]  My cell phone has a video camera.
[01:01:39.319 --> 01:01:45.683]  So I pulled out my cell phone and I was about to start videoing them telling me to leave.
[01:01:46.243 --> 01:01:49.485]  And then the police sergeant grabbed me.
[01:01:50.365 --> 01:01:52.547]  And he tried to rip the cell phone out of my hands.
[01:01:53.447 --> 01:01:54.948]  And then the other cop grabbed me.
[01:01:55.709 --> 01:01:59.232]  And, uh, they were trying to rip the phone away from me so I couldn't record it.
[01:01:59.912 --> 01:02:07.518]  And then, uh, while they were trying to rip the phones out of my hands, the police sergeant pulled out a can of mace and he sprayed me in the eyes.
[01:02:08.438 --> 01:02:11.941]  And then they put my arms behind my back and they handcuffed me.
[01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:13.482]  And they put the handcuffs on pretty tight.
[01:02:14.463 --> 01:02:17.285]  And then they, they, uh, they were, they were questioning me.
[01:02:17.745 --> 01:02:19.947]  They were, uh, searching through my stuff.
[01:02:21.099 --> 01:02:23.301]  And, uh, I was handcuffed in front of a library.
[01:02:23.321 --> 01:02:24.882]  They said they were going to take me to the jail.
[01:02:25.683 --> 01:02:28.585]  And, uh, while they were doing this, I was saying, well, what have I done wrong?
[01:02:28.605 --> 01:02:30.006]  What crime has been committed here?
[01:02:30.026 --> 01:02:34.409]  I mean, did I engage in an act of violence, you know, theft or destruction of property?
[01:02:34.429 --> 01:02:35.410]  And they wouldn't answer me.
[01:02:35.991 --> 01:02:38.272]  And then I said, well, who is the victim of this crime?
[01:02:39.013 --> 01:02:39.793]  And they wouldn't answer me.
[01:02:39.814 --> 01:02:40.874]  And I kept asking them that.
[01:02:41.335 --> 01:02:44.297]  And then finally, the police sergeant said the state of Maryland is the victim.
[01:02:45.129 --> 01:02:49.772]  And I said, well, it's the state government that requires us to get these petition signatures.
[01:02:49.812 --> 01:02:53.715]  This is a legal requirement we have to fulfill to be able to run candidates.
[01:02:54.275 --> 01:02:55.536]  And then he wouldn't answer me again.
[01:02:55.916 --> 01:02:59.579]  And then I asked him if he took an oath to defend the Constitution.
[01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:01.280]  I asked him if he knew what the First Amendment said.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.541]  And he wouldn't answer me.
[01:03:03.322 --> 01:03:05.363]  And then they took me to the jail.
[01:03:06.223 --> 01:03:08.705]  And they put leg cuffs on me.
[01:03:09.326 --> 01:03:14.149]  And I was kept in the jail there in Howard County.
[01:03:14.898 --> 01:03:43.341]  uh... for several hours they put me in a cell they fingerprinted me and uh... i i was released a few hours later but i had to sit in jail for several hours and they released me just out on the street uh... my car i didn't have my car so i had to walk and find a a phone and uh... find somebody who could uh... uh... who could come and get me and then i had to go get my stuff but anyway now they're saying that i have to uh... appear in court
[01:03:44.361 --> 01:04:05.181]  On March 19th, or I'm going to have to pay a $2,000 fine, and they're charging me with trespassing, and they're saying that I was soliciting, even though I clearly told them I was petitioning, I showed them the petition, I was not soliciting and petitioning are not the same thing, and they said that I was resisting arrest.
[01:04:05.894 --> 01:04:08.996]  Even though they just grabbed me and tried to rip the camera off.
[01:04:09.016 --> 01:04:09.737]  Oh, of course.
[01:04:10.117 --> 01:04:12.138]  They grabbed you so you're assaulting them.
[01:04:12.218 --> 01:04:13.259]  That's how it normally works.
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:15.420]  Send me an email.
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:17.622]  Watson at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:18.202 --> 01:04:23.786]  Either you can write up the story or just give me the basic details and I'll write up the story.
[01:04:24.166 --> 01:04:25.707]  But again, it's completely criminal.
[01:04:25.947 --> 01:04:28.848]  Let me grab you and then say that you were resisting arrest.
[01:04:29.448 --> 01:04:31.009]  You've got every right to film them.
[01:04:31.129 --> 01:04:33.930]  You've got every right to stand on a public street corner.
[01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:37.271]  And they're criminals and you need to get a good lawyer and sue them.
[01:04:38.051 --> 01:04:38.851]  Thanks for the call.
[01:04:38.911 --> 01:04:43.013]  Send me an email and we'll make it into a big story on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:43.573 --> 01:04:46.014]  Alright, second hour, second segment coming up.
[01:04:46.414 --> 01:04:54.417]  Joel Skousen is our guest and we'll go to more of your calls on this Monday, December 20th edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:05:02.352 --> 01:05:03.632]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:04.093 --> 01:05:09.454]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy-to-fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:05:09.814 --> 01:05:14.116]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[01:05:14.576 --> 01:05:17.897]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.
[01:05:18.317 --> 01:05:24.799]  They have two holiday price packs for you to put into your reserves for a secure future or to share with others.
[01:05:25.259 --> 01:05:27.980]  The first is a six-month bulk supply in 10 cans.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:36.003]  And the second is a five-week supply of quick and easy-to-fix meals, including delicious bakery items shipped in heavy tote bags.
[01:05:36.543 --> 01:05:43.206]  Now, for a limited time, when you order two or more of these special holiday packs, you'll get free shipping on your entire order.

[01:05:47.808 --> 01:05:50.229]  That's 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:04.921]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.321 --> 01:06:08.322]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.562 --> 01:06:13.343]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:13.363 --> 01:06:19.625]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:19.745 --> 01:06:21.986]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:22.526 --> 01:06:22.806]  Tim Geithner?
[01:06:22.826 --> 01:06:23.246]  Bernanke?
[01:06:23.347 --> 01:06:23.987]  They're arsonists!
[01:06:24.007 --> 01:06:24.667]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:24.687 --> 01:06:26.809]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.437 --> 01:06:43.258]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:06:43.558 --> 01:06:48.361]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:48.701 --> 01:06:57.826]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:07:01.602 --> 01:07:04.404]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[01:07:04.965 --> 01:07:09.890]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:13.353]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.

[01:07:20.118 --> 01:07:21.059]  Take my word for it.
[01:07:21.259 --> 01:07:23.581]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[01:07:23.901 --> 01:07:30.125]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[01:07:30.425 --> 01:07:31.826]  Buy American and stay clean.

[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:52.500]  Thank you!
[01:08:01.724 --> 01:08:07.758]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:11.367]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.236 --> 01:08:16.597]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:16.617 --> 01:08:17.178]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:19.279 --> 01:08:32.885]  We'll be taking your calls for Joel Skousen, political scientist, former fighter pilot, and of course, editor of World Affairs Brief, a weekly online newsletter as well as a monthly print edition.
[01:08:33.605 --> 01:08:36.967]  Which you can subscribe to at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[01:08:37.127 --> 01:08:40.769]  And I received my copy on Friday and it's a great read.
[01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:44.311]  I mean it really boils down the important issues of the week.
[01:08:45.332 --> 01:08:46.873]  Sorts out the week from the chaff.
[01:08:47.913 --> 01:08:53.556]  And we're going to be covering some of the issues that Joel Skousen talks about in his most recent edition.
[01:08:54.357 --> 01:08:56.898]  And we'll be opening up the phone lines later on as well.
[01:08:57.459 --> 01:08:59.580]  Joel Skousen, welcome to the show today.
[01:09:00.697 --> 01:09:01.498]  Thank you, Paul.
[01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:07.888]  It's always good to be with you, and I'm a great fan of your writings and your work on PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:11.454]  Thanks Joel, appreciate that.
[01:09:12.035 --> 01:09:26.308]  I was reading your World Affairs Brief when I received it on Friday, and the primary concern in this issue is of course the so-called Bush tax cuts, which of course, you know, in reality are no tax cuts at all.
[01:09:26.388 --> 01:09:30.652]  At best they're a kind of stopgap continuation of the same policies.
[01:09:31.813 --> 01:09:40.278]  And in fact, as you document, in a number of ways, we'll actually end up fleecing the American people to an even greater extent.
[01:09:40.859 --> 01:09:52.826]  I mean, explain to the listeners the price that Republicans have paid to the Obama administration merely to continue basically what was already in place with these tax cuts.
[01:09:54.122 --> 01:10:01.168]  Yes, it's a very important point that this really isn't, you know, a tax cut for the wealthy or for anybody really.
[01:10:01.228 --> 01:10:03.510]  This was going to be a tax increase.
[01:10:03.610 --> 01:10:05.611]  Taxes going up on January 1st.
[01:10:06.272 --> 01:10:16.060]  But it's interesting because this really wouldn't have taken place, any of these tax increases, until the following year.
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.964]  In other words, you'd have a whole year for the Congress to work on these and to get them back into place.
[01:10:21.519 --> 01:10:31.342]  So the Republicans played as if they were being held hostage by the Democrats, that these things had to be passed during the lame duck session lest they go into effect on January 1st.
[01:10:31.802 --> 01:10:44.045]  But it would have been just as easy for the Republicans to wait until they install a new Congress where they have control over the public purse in January, late January, and they could have simply made it retroactive to January 1st.
[01:10:44.065 --> 01:10:48.386]  So there really was no pressure to accede to these demands of Obama.
[01:10:48.566 --> 01:10:50.847]  And what they did in this devil's deal
[01:10:51.528 --> 01:11:09.726]  is first of all made a secret agreement uh... to in essence not uh... or they agreed to fund uh... the uh... the congress the federal spending or budget through september two thousand eleven and that would have included of course funding for obama care
[01:11:10.737 --> 01:11:19.562]  Which is the only way that the Republicans could have stopped Obamacare from going into place is to stop the funding of the various tax provisions that are involved there.
[01:11:20.222 --> 01:11:24.924]  In addition, they allowed Obama to talk them into a massive increase in the
[01:11:27.179 --> 01:11:55.219]  uh... estate tax one of the most hated taxes in America because essentially it's double taxation you pay according to the agreement thirty five percent of anything over five million dollars uh... that would have uh... accrued and that's money that you already paid taxes on so the estate tax was actually down to zero and that's a major increase to bring that back up to the thirty five percent range but fortunately this had a
[01:11:57.694 --> 01:11:59.735]  You know, partially happy ending.
[01:12:00.275 --> 01:12:23.721]  The commitment that the Republicans made to go along with the continuing resolution, the omnibus spending bill, was filled with so much pork, and a lot of that was because of Republicans requesting various pork barrel things being added to the bill, that Mitch McConnell ended up in the Senate being very, very embarrassed when it came out, in fact, that he had demanded a lot of these things.
[01:12:23.801 --> 01:12:26.622]  And so he reneged on his agreement with Obama.
[01:12:27.282 --> 01:12:31.065]  And turned around and put in a one-page continuing resolution.
[01:12:31.105 --> 01:12:39.490]  It basically says, we'll fund the government through the first few months of the next year, and then we'll take it up again as a Congress.
[01:12:39.690 --> 01:12:46.674]  And what this shows, Paul, of course, is that we cannot trust the Republicans really to do what they said in their pledge.
[01:12:46.714 --> 01:12:47.975]  They were going to stop spending.
[01:12:47.995 --> 01:12:50.377]  They were not going to have any omnibus bills.
[01:12:50.417 --> 01:12:52.158]  They're going to pass everything individually.
[01:12:52.725 --> 01:12:55.650]  None of that is true as of this date.
[01:12:56.091 --> 01:13:02.863]  And of course we'll have to see what they do after this pressure continues in January when they take office.
[01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:15.913]  So, so it basically eviscerates, if you get past five million dollars, um, throughout the course of your life, it eviscerates your savings by taxing what's already been taxed on your income.
[01:13:16.273 --> 01:13:22.815]  I mean, Joel, I mean, where do they get off on double-taxing Americans' wealth that's already been taxed?
[01:13:22.875 --> 01:13:23.815]  Isn't that illegal?
[01:13:25.416 --> 01:13:27.418]  Well, actually, you know, that's interesting.
[01:13:27.458 --> 01:13:30.742]  There really is no law that says you can't double-tax something.
[01:13:30.842 --> 01:13:38.930]  It's a principle that has been in vogue in America since the American Revolution, but it's been violated ever since the estate tax was passed.
[01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:44.231]  And they did so, of course, under the old populist notion of taxing the rich.
[01:13:44.632 --> 01:13:54.355]  It's very, very difficult for people to realize how evil it is to tax only a sector, the sector that doesn't gore my ox, so to speak.
[01:13:54.375 --> 01:13:56.655]  And that's what the American people have engaged in.
[01:13:56.675 --> 01:14:04.058]  It took us years to get rid of the estate tax, and then they only made it a temporary, you know, getting rid of it, and now it's coming back.
[01:14:04.518 --> 01:14:08.799]  So we're going to get... The tax deal did pass, and by the way, they did increase
[01:14:09.386 --> 01:14:16.608]  The limit up to $10 million at the last minute in order to placate those that were very, very incensed about the estate tax.
[01:14:17.168 --> 01:14:25.271]  But still, what worries me, of course, is that if you start to get hyperinflation in the United States, everybody's estate could rise within a few years to $10 million.
[01:14:25.811 --> 01:14:29.112]  So there's no real great safety in having that exemption amount.
[01:14:30.919 --> 01:14:32.919]  I mean, that's exactly the point.
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:38.361]  They cry, you know, let's tax the rich to fix all these deficits in the budget.
[01:14:38.901 --> 01:14:42.081]  And yet, they define the rich as people earning $200,000.
[01:14:42.121 --> 01:14:44.882]  It's like in Britain.
[01:14:46.142 --> 01:14:49.003]  They define the rich as anyone who earns over Â£100,000.
[01:14:49.063 --> 01:14:50.363]  And then they take 50% of their income.
[01:14:50.383 --> 01:14:50.803]  I mean,
[01:14:54.444 --> 01:14:55.585]  That's the middle class.
[01:14:55.665 --> 01:15:03.310]  You're not taxing the rich if anyone above $200,000 has to give most of their income to the federal government.
[01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:05.011]  It's amazing.
[01:15:05.551 --> 01:15:10.474]  We had an article written by Ron Paul which we posted on the website about these tax cuts.
[01:15:11.015 --> 01:15:14.257]  Not tax cuts, just a continuation of the same policy and in fact
[01:15:15.197 --> 01:15:18.318]  An introduction again, a reintroduction of the estate tax.
[01:15:19.118 --> 01:15:35.903]  And he said that all this thrashing about on the minutiae of this policy was again taking the focus away from the real engine of substantive monetary manipulation and oppression of the American people, which of course is the Federal Reserve and the income tax.
[01:15:38.064 --> 01:15:47.389]  Paul points out that for 120 years the federal government was funded with excise taxes and the income tax, as we know it today, didn't even exist.
[01:15:47.829 --> 01:16:02.997]  So, I mean, Joel, how do you respond to these statists, these big government liberals who claim that the income tax is so sacred that the whole country would collapse in an instant if it was abolished in America?
[01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:05.519]  Well, you know, it's interesting.
[01:16:06.657 --> 01:16:11.525]  The government, of course, has grown to absorb whatever tax level that it takes from the people.
[01:16:13.789 --> 01:16:23.174]  Not get along at all anymore on excise taxes, simply because it is a small percentage relative to what the government spends.
[01:16:23.535 --> 01:16:29.018]  Ron Paul is absolutely right that the problem is government spending, not the amount that you tax.
[01:16:30.058 --> 01:16:39.203]  I personally am not in favor of, even though that was the original constitutional tax of excise taxes, because frankly that is a selective tax.
[01:16:39.464 --> 01:16:42.025]  It isn't directly related to any government service.
[01:16:42.566 --> 01:16:46.749]  It simply penalizes those that wish to purchase overseas.
[01:16:47.789 --> 01:16:52.832]  I really believe that there are certain principles of taxation that need to be employed in the United States.
[01:16:53.032 --> 01:17:02.238]  One is that the tax be directly related to the government service and that you shall not tax ever to transfer money to any other person.
[01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:11.622]  For any welfare or benefits or unemployment compensation, none of that could be done by taxes, but has to be done by user fees and insurance.
[01:17:12.162 --> 01:17:19.725]  So the only real two viable taxes in libertarian thought are property taxes.
[01:17:21.385 --> 01:17:25.607]  I know a lot of people don't like property taxes, but in fact, government does protect property.
[01:17:26.895 --> 01:17:31.518]  So you have to pay for the protection of property, even if it's on a national basis.
[01:17:32.678 --> 01:17:33.879]  They are protecting property.
[01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:36.040]  And secondly, people.
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:42.803]  And it doesn't cost the government really any more to protect a rich person than a poor person.
[01:17:42.843 --> 01:17:48.946]  And so head taxes, in fact, are the very real and appropriate portion of taxes.
[01:17:48.986 --> 01:17:52.187]  But they should be kept small, of course, because that is a
[01:17:54.066 --> 01:17:57.028]  Not, you know, a heavy burden on government.
[01:17:57.308 --> 01:18:00.090]  Mostly it's the land area of government that needs to be protected.
[01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:14.758]  And that's why you can have some type of taxation that is formed based on the productivity and use of the land so that raw land isn't taxed or agriculture isn't taxed as much as heavy industrial use of property.
[01:18:15.919 --> 01:18:22.623]  But those are some of the principles that I know Ron and I, Ron Paul and I, have talked about that would be the ideal way to
[01:18:23.439 --> 01:18:25.199]  There'd be no income tax.
[01:18:25.239 --> 01:18:31.501]  People should not be penalized for being productive, for working in that regard.
[01:18:32.421 --> 01:18:47.044]  And of course, in order to make these kinds of taxes work, you simply have to cut government back to the original constitutional principle of only defending fundamental rights and not forgiving benefits, foreign aid, welfare, or fighting foreign wars, for that matter.
[01:18:48.576 --> 01:18:53.617]  And not for hiring garbage collectors to hunt for terrorists, which might also save a little money.
[01:18:54.517 --> 01:19:01.459]  I also noted in your most recent World Affairs Brief that you've been covering the WikiLeaks story.
[01:19:02.219 --> 01:19:05.299]  And I've been looking into this over the past few days.
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:17.122]  And of course, we know that WikiLeaks was founded by Tibetan dissidents and that their original stated goal was to root out corruption and abuse.
[01:19:17.902 --> 01:19:25.952]  In these countries in East Asia, in the Middle East, there are primarily targets of the US military-industrial complex.
[01:19:26.453 --> 01:19:33.421]  We also know that in the embryonic stages of WikiLeaks that they sought help from George Soros's controlled
[01:19:34.062 --> 01:19:36.224]  Freedom House Organization.
[01:19:36.684 --> 01:19:49.335]  So, I want to talk a little about Julian Assange and what's really going on behind WikiLeaks and behind the story for mass consumption that we're being bombarded with on a daily basis in the establishment media.
[01:19:49.896 --> 01:19:51.837]  Joel Skousen, World Affairs Brief.
[01:19:52.518 --> 01:19:53.519]  The interview continues.
[01:19:53.539 --> 01:19:54.680]  We'll also take your calls.
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:56.361]  It's the Alex Jones Show live.
[01:19:56.641 --> 01:19:57.802]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:19:57.902 --> 01:19:58.363]  Stay tuned.
[01:20:00.330 --> 01:20:01.931]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[01:20:02.091 --> 01:20:03.232]  How would that make you feel?
[01:20:03.452 --> 01:20:04.813]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:20:05.154 --> 01:20:07.455]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:20:07.696 --> 01:20:14.981]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:20:15.261 --> 01:20:16.622]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:20:16.742 --> 01:20:19.424]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[01:20:19.504 --> 01:20:24.568]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:20:24.808 --> 01:20:29.832]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:20:30.032 --> 01:20:34.895]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:20:35.135 --> 01:20:39.177]  Order at hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:20:39.557 --> 01:20:44.580]  That's hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.602]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[01:20:47.622 --> 01:20:52.304]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[01:20:52.344 --> 01:20:56.907]  Details at hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:20:59.833 --> 01:21:03.116]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:21:03.937 --> 01:21:08.162]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:21:08.442 --> 01:21:14.368]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:21:14.588 --> 01:21:16.750]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:21:17.031 --> 01:21:22.997]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:21:23.117 --> 01:21:26.441]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:21:26.521 --> 01:21:28.223]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:21:28.403 --> 01:21:30.446]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:21:30.586 --> 01:21:35.232]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.

[01:21:59.682 --> 01:22:03.807]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:22:03.867 --> 01:22:05.128]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:22:05.288 --> 01:22:09.012]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:11.835]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[01:22:12.035 --> 01:22:13.837]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:22:14.018 --> 01:22:16.340]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:22:17.341 --> 01:22:26.094]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:29.559]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:22:29.619 --> 01:22:32.724]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[01:23:47.246 --> 01:23:50.588]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[01:23:50.608 --> 01:24:04.177]  What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
[01:24:04.237 --> 01:24:08.040]  You're a presenter
[01:24:12.418 --> 01:24:16.301]  Alex Jones Show live with Joel Scouse and WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[01:24:16.941 --> 01:24:18.222]  Now, WikiLeaks.
[01:24:18.803 --> 01:24:35.895]  We had this bizarre dump of thousands of supposedly unfiltered cables, which for the most part merely bolstered the rhetoric behind the war on terror and the US military-industrial complex agenda in the Middle East and East Asia.
[01:24:36.375 --> 01:24:38.237]  And in fact, what most people don't know is that
[01:24:38.997 --> 01:24:49.783]  These cables and the way they're being shaped into stories and released to the public is being handled by primarily the New York Times in concert with the US government.
[01:24:49.983 --> 01:24:54.726]  That's right, the New York Times is going to the US government and saying, what do we need to redact?
[01:24:54.806 --> 01:24:59.668]  What can we keep in before they release their stories about these WikiLeaks cables?
[01:25:00.048 --> 01:25:00.569]  And of course,
[01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:08.415]  They're all centered around, for example, Iran buying missiles from North Korea that can reach Western Europe.
[01:25:08.815 --> 01:25:22.806]  So, these cables seemingly conflict with WikiLeaks' agenda to expose corruption and abuse, and in fact seem to be serving more as a propaganda boost for the war on terror.
[01:25:23.766 --> 01:25:27.789]  Joel, I've got your quote here from World Affairs Brief where you said,
[01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:43.055]  Quote, the WikiLeaks revelations appear to be purposeful leaks by government to provide further impetus to shut down future whistleblowers who might uncover government illegal acts hiding under the cover of national security secrets.
[01:25:43.535 --> 01:25:49.337]  And now of course we've got the basically the false flag against the internet now they're using it to go after that.
[01:25:50.297 --> 01:25:53.178]  Joel, could you expand on this WikiLeaks situation?
[01:25:54.477 --> 01:25:56.118]  Yes, it's very, very suspicious.
[01:25:56.198 --> 01:26:07.668]  You know, anytime you have a multi-million dollar organization come out of nowhere with no real funding that's apparent, you have to wonder, you know, who's behind this?
[01:26:07.748 --> 01:26:11.231]  Because this just doesn't happen very, very easily.
[01:26:11.311 --> 01:26:17.616]  It's like we found out that Google had a too-good-to-be-true startup with NSA and CIA funding.
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:32.996]  And now we find that Wikileaks has some of these funding as well, as well as some big international foundations, which Julian Assange has admitted have funded this, but he refuses to name which one because he says that we'll lose our grants.
[01:26:33.056 --> 01:26:37.140]  In other words, they agreed only to give if it were kept in secret.
[01:26:40.925 --> 01:26:48.889]  Parsing out these quarter million cables to mainstream news items is a very, very important point.
[01:26:49.830 --> 01:27:00.656]  None other than David E. Sanger, supposedly independent journalist working for the New York Times, is in charge of filtering these cables to the public.
[01:27:01.249 --> 01:27:19.154]  And this is a guy who's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Aspen Institute Strategy Group, uh, you know, with the likes of Madeleine Albright, Condoleezza Rice, uh, William Perry, John Deutch, uh, William Bezolik, Philip Zelikoff, you know, all of these people are very, very big in the globalist regime.
[01:27:19.835 --> 01:27:27.297]  They are, uh, part of the government, uh, uh, procedure to shield the government from exposure from the illegal acts that they are doing.
[01:27:27.977 --> 01:27:30.838]  And one of my major complaints is that these, uh,
[01:27:31.383 --> 01:27:33.525]  Dumps appear like they have been pre-filtered.
[01:27:34.265 --> 01:27:52.219]  If you really truly had a dump of a quarter million cables, there would be dozens and dozens of secret admissions and instructions given to people about interference with government that would make the present resolutions, or revelations, look outrageous by comparison.
[01:27:52.499 --> 01:27:53.700]  And there's nothing in that.
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:55.882]  And then we're fed the story that this
[01:27:57.114 --> 01:28:20.644]  uh... young private uh... you know is uh... uh... apparently had uh... was in charge of uh... or at least had access to all these cables that anybody's been in government such as myself knows that that just isn't possible uh... there isn't anyone in that level of government that has access to these kinds of cables and if it were true whistleblower and interestingly paul there's no evidence at all that this private
[01:28:21.264 --> 01:28:23.206]  Is political in any sense whatsoever.
[01:28:23.226 --> 01:28:39.319]  He doesn't have an agenda about exposing government wrongdoing, but if it were a true whistleblower, he would be ferreting out the most dangerous cables and leaking those to make sure that those got exposure, not dumping supposedly a quarter million cables at a time.
[01:28:39.399 --> 01:28:47.246]  And I think, in fact, the story about the dump merely was planted in order to give the impression that this is unfiltered.
[01:28:47.694 --> 01:28:49.476]  But in fact, it's clearly filtered.
[01:28:49.936 --> 01:28:56.723]  Anyone who knows what goes on in cables in the diplomatic regime knows that there's a great deal of filtering that's going on.
[01:28:58.499 --> 01:29:14.931]  And I mean, not only is Assange admitting to the fact that he's funded by these unknown millionaires, he's actually making deals with governments, reportedly the government of Israel, not to embarrass them by redacting whole cables and whole documents.
[01:29:15.291 --> 01:29:19.314]  So he's making deals with some of the most corrupt and abusive governments on the planet,
[01:29:19.674 --> 01:29:25.195]  While claiming, you know, he fronts for an organization aimed at exposing corruption and abuse.
[01:29:25.575 --> 01:29:30.416]  Some very, very strange contradictions arising out of this WikiLeaks story.
[01:29:31.196 --> 01:29:40.078]  And we'll go on to discuss it after the break, including Julian Assange's view on 9-11 and why we haven't seen any WikiLeaks cables on that.
[01:29:40.498 --> 01:29:41.958]  We'll be back after the break.
[01:29:42.219 --> 01:29:43.499]  Alex Jones Show Live.
[01:29:43.519 --> 01:29:44.059]  Stay tuned.
[01:29:50.578 --> 01:29:53.587]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:57.197]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.063 --> 01:30:04.306]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:04.606 --> 01:30:04.887]  Number 1.
[01:30:05.527 --> 01:30:08.689]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:09.510]  Number 2.
[01:30:09.810 --> 01:30:14.374]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:14.714 --> 01:30:15.154]  It's true.
[01:30:15.454 --> 01:30:20.018]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.318 --> 01:30:20.858]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.159 --> 01:30:24.441]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:24.741 --> 01:30:28.424]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.624 --> 01:30:29.184]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.425 --> 01:30:31.786]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.187 --> 01:30:35.569]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:35.869 --> 01:30:36.409]  Number 5.
[01:30:36.670 --> 01:30:40.572]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:40.813 --> 01:30:45.576]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:32:09.184 --> 01:32:13.485]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.

[01:33:11.325 --> 01:33:16.647]  The United States needs to do something to stop Mr. Assange.
[01:33:16.847 --> 01:33:19.088]  We're looking at that right now.
[01:33:19.108 --> 01:33:25.950]  The Justice Department is taking a look at that and I'm not going to comment on that process.
[01:33:26.170 --> 01:33:27.151]  Do you think he's a criminal?
[01:33:29.131 --> 01:33:30.212]  If he conspired,
[01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:37.062]  To get these classified documents with a member of the U.S.
[01:33:37.102 --> 01:33:45.684]  military, that's fundamentally different than if somebody drops on your lap, here David, you're a press person, here is classified material.
[01:33:45.744 --> 01:33:47.565]  Mr. McConnell says he's a high-tech terrorist.
[01:33:47.645 --> 01:33:49.825]  Others say this is akin to the Pentagon Papers.
[01:33:49.925 --> 01:33:50.506]  What do you come to?
[01:33:50.526 --> 01:33:55.107]  I would argue that it's closer to being a high-tech terrorist than the Pentagon Papers.
[01:33:55.953 --> 01:34:02.757]  So that's Vice President Joe Beden saying that Julian Assange of WikiLeaks is a high-tech terrorist.
[01:34:03.357 --> 01:34:11.282]  Very strange charge to make, given the fact that the New York Times of David E. Sanger
[01:34:11.542 --> 01:34:24.384]  New York Times Chief Washington Correspondent states, quote, we went through the cables so carefully to try to redact material that we thought would be damaging to individuals or undercut ongoing operations.
[01:34:24.805 --> 01:34:36.867]  And we even took the very unusual step of showing the 100 cables or so that we were writing from to the US government and asking them if they had additional redactions to suggest.
[01:34:37.247 --> 01:34:37.367]  So
[01:34:37.907 --> 01:34:40.549]  The New York Times is working hand-in-hand with the U.S.
[01:34:40.589 --> 01:34:51.776]  government to release WikiLeaks cables, and yet the Vice President Biden is saying that Julian Assange is a high-tech terrorist for releasing WikiLeaks cables.
[01:34:53.136 --> 01:34:57.439]  Joel Skousen, how do you square those two contradictions?
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:05.824]  Well, it's very, very clear that the new SHIELD Act introduced by government shill Joe Lieberman, Senator,
[01:35:07.703 --> 01:35:18.386]  Is merely a pretext in order to begin to prosecute people for revealing government secrets, especially the ones that would reveal government wrongdoing.
[01:35:18.586 --> 01:35:19.347]  It's very interesting.
[01:35:19.367 --> 01:35:34.311]  There's an extreme contradiction in law here because there is a federal statute which actually makes it a crime to not reveal to anyone, especially a judge, you must reveal any wrongdoing that you find within the federal government.
[01:35:34.764 --> 01:35:44.369]  And you're protected by law in that regard, and now they want a crime to make it basically a crime that anytime you reveal anything in secret, regardless of the substance, that you could be prosecuted.
[01:35:44.650 --> 01:35:45.810]  That's what the SHIELD Act does.
[01:35:46.331 --> 01:35:54.115]  It actually starts out by saying its focus is to make sure that no one reveals any source, confidential source, within the government.
[01:35:55.135 --> 01:35:59.598]  And of course, all that's been redacted, so nothing in that qualifies within WikiLeaks.
[01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:07.337]  But then there's also fine print that says anything that might be detrimental to the interest of the or the security interest of the federal government.
[01:36:08.117 --> 01:36:15.243]  What's interesting about that, of course, is that one, it's a wide open loophole that anything can be viewed as detrimental to the security of the United States government.
[01:36:15.983 --> 01:36:19.046]  But in several court precedents recently,
[01:36:19.625 --> 01:36:30.309]  The federal government has ruled, and incredibly, judges have gone along with this, that basically says that anything that we the government label as secret or top secret cannot even be reviewed by the courts.
[01:36:30.849 --> 01:36:37.291]  Meaning that the courts are not allowed to judge whether or not there's any substance to the claim that these things should not be protected.
[01:36:37.904 --> 01:36:47.615]  By National Security State Secrets Acts, but in fact just by merely being ruled secret that government and courts are not allowed to review those.
[01:36:47.935 --> 01:36:53.702]  This is a very real Catch-22 situation that we're heading for and I think it's very, very dangerous, Paul.
[01:36:55.279 --> 01:37:10.497]  And in World Affairs Brief you include the harrowing quote from Naomi Klein, where she points out that the last time we saw criticism of the state labelled as treason was of course in Nazi Germany, so I was interested to read that.
[01:37:11.017 --> 01:37:14.441]  But I mean, the thing that gets me about Wikileaks is
[01:37:15.402 --> 01:37:21.910]  We've seen nothing about Israel's war on Lebanon from that period of time from May to September 2006.
[01:37:22.130 --> 01:37:24.993]  There's a complete gap in the cables.
[01:37:25.554 --> 01:37:28.517]  We've got talk of him making deals with the Israeli government.
[01:37:28.537 --> 01:37:34.865]  We've got Netanyahu coming out and saying that a deal was made to prevent Israel being embarrassed, basically.
[01:37:35.605 --> 01:37:37.406]  And then, again, 9-11.
[01:37:37.606 --> 01:37:40.367]  Complete absence of any information whatsoever.
[01:37:40.447 --> 01:37:45.029]  This is the kind of stuff that would really harm the US military-industrial complex.
[01:37:45.089 --> 01:37:47.570]  And we've seen neither hide nor hair of it.
[01:37:47.610 --> 01:37:58.635]  I mean, you had Sybil Edmonds, the FBI translator, immediately prior to 9-11 getting a deluge of communications concerning an imminent attack.
[01:37:58.735 --> 01:38:02.657]  And yet, WikiLeaks, in these quarter of a million cables,
[01:38:03.297 --> 01:38:06.199]  Has released nothing whatsoever on 9-11.
[01:38:06.379 --> 01:38:24.430]  You know, nothing on the Five Dancing Israelis, nothing on the secret Bin Laden flights out of the country on September 12th when all air traffic was grounded, and nothing about the Israelis Mossad agents that were arrested on the George Washington Bridge with 2,000 pounds of explosives.
[01:38:24.770 --> 01:38:26.471]  So, anything that could be
[01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:28.812]  Viewed as damaging to the U.S.
[01:38:28.852 --> 01:38:32.873]  military-industrial complex is nowhere to be seen.
[01:38:32.953 --> 01:38:50.360]  I mean, does that indicate that, well, we know that the New York Times is working with the government to decide what gets released, and I suppose, Joel, that's really the smoking gun, that these cables released by WikiLeaks are just basically a regurgitation of neocon propaganda for the most part.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:51.240]  Isn't that the case?
[01:38:52.561 --> 01:38:55.602]  It is true, and I don't view, I mean,
[01:38:57.701 --> 01:39:06.974]  The military-industrial complex is part of the problem, to be sure, but these people are lackeys for a larger globalist conspiracy trying to take down national sovereignty, create war and conflict.
[01:39:08.356 --> 01:39:11.521]  You see, it really isn't just greedy capitalism.
[01:39:11.581 --> 01:39:12.983]  This isn't just for money.
[01:39:14.137 --> 01:39:19.722]  I mean, these people are already the most wealthy people in the world.
[01:39:19.783 --> 01:39:21.064]  How much more money do they need?
[01:39:21.845 --> 01:39:23.286]  That's not really the issue.
[01:39:23.346 --> 01:39:31.034]  The issue is they have to reward people to entice them from the military-industrial complex into this globalist conspiracy of power.
[01:39:31.074 --> 01:39:32.856]  But it's much bigger than just greed.
[01:39:33.296 --> 01:39:35.359]  It is about power, international power.
[01:39:35.899 --> 01:39:35.999]  Yeah.
[01:39:49.421 --> 01:39:52.803]  For example, about the Lebanon War that they would never have allowed.
[01:39:53.463 --> 01:40:02.207]  There had to be, for example, communication with the United States telling Israel for the first time to go after civilian targets because that was the major change.
[01:40:02.547 --> 01:40:07.069]  A wholesale went after bombing and strafing of civilian infrastructure targets in Lebanon.
[01:40:07.549 --> 01:40:13.372]  In general, the Israelis have, except for Gaza, have not done that in their wars.
[01:40:13.952 --> 01:40:16.693]  That would have been very, very telling for the U.S.
[01:40:16.773 --> 01:40:17.134]  to be
[01:40:18.875 --> 01:40:18.995]  I'm
[01:40:35.999 --> 01:40:38.620]  A funding of terrorism that would have been caught up in those cables.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:52.146]  None of that, as you said, has come forward and that's why this is, in fact, a rigged game specifically to give justification for this type of legislation by Lieberman, the SHIELD Act, to get passed.
[01:40:52.806 --> 01:41:02.690]  Now, I also wanted to say before, just to cut in here before we lose time on this, I wanted to make a point about your first story you were talking about with the Libertarians who were taking signatures.
[01:41:03.630 --> 01:41:04.831]  It's very important to understand
[01:41:05.461 --> 01:41:21.711]  That almost never do any judges uphold a citizen against the witness of a policeman when they file the reports and they always falsify the evidence in order to justify their reason for taking them into custody.
[01:41:21.831 --> 01:41:23.312]  Always claim resisting arrest.
[01:41:23.712 --> 01:41:26.834]  They claim that they were attacked by the civilian that they arrest.
[01:41:27.654 --> 01:41:30.796]  So one never wants to get into a situation with government
[01:41:31.354 --> 01:41:34.198]  Without pre-preparing to take the evidence.
[01:41:34.518 --> 01:41:41.067]  I think there was a major mistake by telling him I need to take out my cell phone and record your telling me to leave.
[01:41:41.127 --> 01:41:42.909]  He should have already had that out there.
[01:41:43.524 --> 01:41:53.486]  I turned on, and I often will use a tape recorder I can just put in my coat pocket so at least I get the verbal one if they take my cell phone away.
[01:41:53.906 --> 01:42:02.888]  But you should always have witnesses there present who are doing the recording so that you can take it from a disinterested third party.
[01:42:03.388 --> 01:42:09.569]  But we need to be very careful to document what happens in the increasing, tyrannical state of police.
[01:42:11.127 --> 01:42:13.548]  Joel Skousen, worldaffairsbrief.com.
[01:42:14.128 --> 01:42:15.989]  Linda in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:42:16.009 --> 01:42:17.989]  Go ahead with your question for Joel Skousen.
[01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:36.075]  Yes, I just found out that this past Saturday night the Senate passed unanimously this Food Safety Modernization Act, which hurts the organic farmers and food producers and small family farms.
[01:42:36.095 --> 01:42:40.557]  It's basically, I guess, helping out corporate big agribusiness.
[01:42:41.671 --> 01:42:54.602]  And for two years, we in Austin, at Fluoride Free Austin, have been fighting Big Agra by the fact that 60% of our cities pay to add fluoride waste to our water.
[01:42:55.243 --> 01:42:57.705]  Then this Senate Food Safety Bill passes.
[01:42:57.765 --> 01:43:00.467]  It's going to just help them out all the more.
[01:43:00.487 --> 01:43:06.733]  And we also have the issue of toxic bio-sludge, which our cities are making.
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:11.982]  Giving out free to people in the community or selling it for dirt cheap.
[01:43:12.662 --> 01:43:20.606]  I was wondering if you've addressed these issues, Joel, regarding our water, food safety, Kodak's Elementarius.
[01:43:20.686 --> 01:43:22.547]  It's all driving me crazy!
[01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:26.330]  Well, she brings up very, very good points.
[01:43:26.530 --> 01:43:40.234]  I am covering this even in this week's World Affairs Brief about the Senate, by unanimous consent, in fact, doing a revision, basically, of their flawed Food Safety Bill Act that they passed.
[01:43:40.294 --> 01:43:47.537]  They actually had taxing provisions in it, which made it an unconstitutional piece of legislation that the House could not pick up.
[01:43:47.617 --> 01:43:48.457]  It was red-flagged.
[01:43:48.957 --> 01:43:49.377]  I don't know.
[01:44:07.759 --> 01:44:12.901]  It was enacting or remedying something that had already been passed before.
[01:44:13.341 --> 01:44:20.843]  Normally these things are passed by unanimous consent if there is a technical flaw within them and I think that's how they got it passed.
[01:44:21.283 --> 01:44:23.624]  Unfortunately what a lot of people don't know is that the
[01:44:24.484 --> 01:44:32.525]  Final revision doesn't have the Pester Amendment, which exempts the small producers, which was the main reason why it got passed in the first place.
[01:44:32.666 --> 01:44:41.227]  And so, we've got a very real danger of having small producers being impinged upon with the tremendous paperwork and the restrictions that are involved in this.
[01:44:42.407 --> 01:44:48.248]  I have also, in the past, covered the Codex problems emanating from Europe and how we're slowly implementing that.
[01:44:48.748 --> 01:44:50.329]  The fluoride, I'm very much against.
[01:44:50.389 --> 01:44:52.009]  These are very toxic poisons.
[01:44:52.589 --> 01:45:07.243]  The chemical sludge that she mentioned coming from waste processing facilities and sold as fertilizer and things, they're full of heavy metals, chemicals that should not be used in any way to grow garden vegetables.
[01:45:07.323 --> 01:45:10.345]  So, the caller is very, very knowledgeable.
[01:45:10.446 --> 01:45:16.091]  We try to support those types of exposÃ©s in the World Affairs Brief.
[01:45:17.282 --> 01:45:18.362]  Okay, thanks Linda.
[01:45:18.502 --> 01:45:27.666]  I mean, it's a joke that they call it a Food Safety Act, given that concurrently Americans are literally drinking liquid cancer.
[01:45:27.786 --> 01:45:30.487]  I mean, have you seen this article out of the Washington Post?
[01:45:30.947 --> 01:45:34.288]  US water has large amounts of likely carcinogen.
[01:45:34.728 --> 01:45:42.611]  A US environmental group has found that drinking water in 35 American cities contains hexavalent chromium, a
[01:45:42.771 --> 01:45:46.554]  Probable carcinogen, the Washington Post reported Sunday.
[01:45:46.995 --> 01:46:06.312]  And it's a strange coincidence that this problem centered in California, given the fact that, as Rosalind Peterson documents for California Skywatch, when they analyzed the water samples and found things like arsenic, barium, aluminum, calcium, manganese, lead and iron,
[01:46:07.072 --> 01:46:18.284]  Um, the discovery of these compounds in the water samples matched precisely with the discovery of the same compounds in airborne samples that were taken at the same time.
[01:46:18.584 --> 01:46:22.068]  So, they know for a fact that all this stuff is coming from the air.
[01:46:22.088 --> 01:46:24.651]  Uh, and what do we see whenever we look up?
[01:46:25.271 --> 01:46:31.935]  We see chemtrails and this is, they've measured, they've documented that this stuff is finding its way into our drinking water.
[01:46:32.296 --> 01:46:43.383]  But meanwhile we're being bombarded with the lie, the myth, that the real environmental problem is man-made global warming when Americans are literally drinking liquid cancer.
[01:46:44.123 --> 01:46:47.806]  Ed in Connecticut, you're on the air, your question for Joel Skousen.
[01:46:48.988 --> 01:46:57.558]  Yeah, I was, um, a lot of people, you know, they might not have the money to invest in Palladium and Platinum and Gold or even Silver.
[01:46:58.059 --> 01:47:06.449]  And I was wondering how you guys would people, if it would be practical to invest in less precious metals such as Copper, Brass, Aluminum.
[01:47:09.756 --> 01:47:32.546]  My response is no, and the reason is because the quantities for investment quantities have to be so large, you're talking about tons, and there is no market except to the major industries to get your money back out of those things, whereas there is a much more distributed market in gold and silver, so I think silver is probably the best
[01:47:34.737 --> 01:47:39.765]  Hard money investment right now and I would because it still is fairly reasonably priced.
[01:47:39.785 --> 01:47:47.457]  There is probably going to be a correction in gold and silver, but in the long term it's got to go up double and even triple over in the long term.
[01:47:47.497 --> 01:47:49.180]  So I think it will be a good investment still.
[01:47:50.618 --> 01:47:55.040]  I mean, you can get a one-ounce silver coin for, what's the price now?
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:56.381]  $30, is it?
[01:47:56.821 --> 01:48:12.268]  So, I mean, it still makes a good investment compared to gold, which, as you said, most people can't afford now that it's gone through the roof and all paper currencies are depreciating against it, so it costs you more of those phony fiat currencies to buy precious metals.
[01:48:13.148 --> 01:48:16.370]  Brian in Ohio, your question for Joel Skousen, go ahead.
[01:48:17.890 --> 01:48:18.650]  Hi, Mr. Skousen.
[01:48:18.670 --> 01:48:27.255]  I was just wondering, how do you see the future of the dollar, the world reserve currency, with Russia and China deciding not to trade in U.S.
[01:48:27.295 --> 01:48:27.895]  dollars anymore?
[01:48:29.416 --> 01:48:33.758]  Actually, that's something that is not a major threat.
[01:48:33.938 --> 01:48:38.121]  The amount of their trade between each other in dollars is very, very small anyway.
[01:48:38.181 --> 01:48:40.402]  In fact, they made a similar announcement
[01:48:42.023 --> 01:48:47.246]  Several years ago, I think it was in 2007, they were going to stop trading in dollars and they, in fact, didn't do it.
[01:48:47.786 --> 01:48:51.468]  So, it really isn't a major threat.
[01:48:51.828 --> 01:49:00.732]  We've got to remember that you cannot simply dump the dollar and not have catastrophic consequences for anybody who deals in dollars.
[01:49:01.032 --> 01:49:08.176]  Anyone who has dollar reserves, like China, if they would start to dump dollars in a major way, would reduce the value of everything they have left.
[01:49:08.256 --> 01:49:08.876]  So, in essence,
[01:49:09.276 --> 01:49:14.977]  The world is held hostage by the fact that they've already accepted dollars for things of real value.
[01:49:15.357 --> 01:49:19.198]  And so they have a vested interest in keeping the dollar fairly strong.
[01:49:19.218 --> 01:49:30.140]  And that's why, despite its weakness, it still is holding its own, even against the euro, which will probably collapse even before the dollar, because there's so few out there compared to the dollar.
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:35.141]  There's over $200 trillion that have been monetized out there so that the
[01:49:35.788 --> 01:49:38.549]  Jeff in Delaware, quick question before the break, go ahead.
[01:49:38.589 --> 01:49:39.809]  Yeah, how you doing guys today?
[01:50:05.947 --> 01:50:14.332]  Just to be real quick, yes, uh, I read something like two days, three days ago, that the CIA, Wikileaks, Wikileaks passed the documents to the CIA.
[01:50:14.592 --> 01:50:17.294]  The CIA scanned it and sent it back to Wikileaks.
[01:50:17.674 --> 01:50:20.176]  So, you know, I think I read that in the Guardian.
[01:50:20.676 --> 01:50:22.697]  Um, uh, real quick.
[01:50:23.418 --> 01:50:24.018]  Okay, people.
[01:50:24.038 --> 01:50:26.019]  We're gonna have to stand up worldwide.
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:26.960]  Okay?
[01:50:28.161 --> 01:50:30.322]  Look, it's much deeper than money, gold.
[01:50:31.022 --> 01:50:33.304]  It's something spiritual, like Alex said a couple days ago.
[01:50:34.296 --> 01:50:43.420]  The American people, the people worldwide, we gotta give back to ourselves and... Okay, we lost Jeff.
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:46.261]  We'll get to WikiLeaks after the break with Joel Skousen.
[01:50:46.281 --> 01:50:49.383]  Stay tuned, it's the Alex Jones Show live, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:00.302 --> 01:51:01.564]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.624 --> 01:51:06.970]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.210 --> 01:51:11.836]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.217 --> 01:51:12.617]  It's true.

[01:53:29.145 --> 01:53:30.206]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:53:30.366 --> 01:53:34.769]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:53:34.949 --> 01:53:40.653]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:53:40.753 --> 01:53:44.175]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:53:44.395 --> 01:53:46.997]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:53:47.217 --> 01:53:52.020]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:52.481]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:53:52.501 --> 01:53:53.822]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:53:58.985 --> 01:53:59.076]  Yeah.
[01:54:20.745 --> 01:54:33.431]  Julian Assange quotes, I'm constantly annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9-11 when all around we provide evidence of real conspiracies for war or mass financial fraud.
[01:54:33.991 --> 01:54:35.592]  Funny that he should say that when...
[01:54:36.132 --> 01:54:42.816]  Julian Assange is allowing the US government to decide what information comes out from these WikiLeaks cables.
[01:54:44.237 --> 01:54:50.161]  Is it really in their interest to release information of real conspiracies which would implicate themselves?
[01:54:50.241 --> 01:54:51.002]  I don't think so.
[01:54:51.822 --> 01:54:55.125]  This is the New York Times, Dush Spiegel, the economist.
[01:54:55.185 --> 01:55:04.070]  They're deciding what they want to get out of the WikiLeaks cables and then they're working with the CIA, with the US government, to redact what is necessary.
[01:55:04.431 --> 01:55:04.851]  And while
[01:55:05.652 --> 01:55:09.255]  Joe Beden, the Vice President, calls Assange a high-tech terrorist.
[01:55:09.295 --> 01:55:14.339]  His own government is working with the establishment media to release these cables.
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:16.601]  We're talking to Joel Skousen.
[01:55:17.102 --> 01:55:23.067]  Joel, tell people how they can subscribe to your excellent newsletter, worldaffairsbrief.com.
[01:55:24.431 --> 01:55:30.335]  Well, the World Affairs Brief is showcased on my website, worldaffairsbrief.com.

[01:56:02.613 --> 01:56:04.013]  And, uh, yeah, I got a copy.
[01:56:04.053 --> 01:56:07.194]  It's really in-depth, really hardcore, excellent information.
[01:56:07.674 --> 01:56:10.454]  Scott in Massachusetts, you're on the air with Joel Skousen.
[01:56:10.474 --> 01:56:11.155]  Go ahead, Scott.
[01:56:11.575 --> 01:56:12.675]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:56:13.677 --> 01:56:14.037]  How are you?
[01:56:14.077 --> 01:56:14.857]  Afternoon, Scott.
[01:56:14.877 --> 01:56:15.958]  What's your question today?
[01:56:15.978 --> 01:56:20.479]  Yes, um, I'm gonna shift gears here a little bit, but stay along the lines of Big Brother.
[01:56:20.839 --> 01:56:27.360]  And, um, ask Mr. Skousen if he's ever, um, seen or knows of the American Community Survey.
[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:29.201]  I do.
[01:56:29.501 --> 01:56:30.081]  I have seen it.
[01:56:31.041 --> 01:56:34.182]  Have you received it, and have you had to fill it out too, sir?
[01:56:36.138 --> 01:56:38.380]  Well, I have refused to fill it out.
[01:56:39.461 --> 01:56:53.092]  I don't believe that it is constitutionally authorized for the Census Department to ask the kinds of intrusive questions that they do on the American Community Survey, and I encourage everyone else to refuse to fill it out.
[01:56:54.588 --> 01:57:05.342]  Say that there's all kinds of penalties, but they are extremely reluctant ever to prosecute it because if they got into court it would be very difficult for them, if not impossible, to justify doing so.
[01:57:05.482 --> 01:57:11.270]  So they will rant and rave, but you can be pretty well assured that nothing will happen if you refuse to fill it out.
[01:57:12.446 --> 01:57:13.387]  Okay, thanks, Scott.
[01:57:13.667 --> 01:57:17.270]  Yeah, I mean, these censuses are getting more and more invasive, you know.
[01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:22.133]  It's a legal requirement to say how many people live in your house, that's it.
[01:57:22.713 --> 01:57:27.177]  In Britain now, they're, even ten years ago, were about to have another census next year.
[01:57:27.457 --> 01:57:35.142]  They were asking people what time they left for work, what were their interests, you know, deep personal questions, and it's none of their business.
[01:57:35.563 --> 01:57:38.124]  Mark in Florida, final caller for Joel Skousen.
[01:57:38.144 --> 01:57:38.705]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:57:40.105 --> 01:57:50.164]  I just wondered, do you know of any service provided by a government employee that is not delivered under threats of violence and at the barrel of a gun?
[01:57:55.546 --> 01:58:00.569]  Well, there are services, there are not requirements that are not backed up by the threat of a gun.
[01:58:00.809 --> 01:58:10.115]  But there are services that are yielded that, I mean, for example, you're not required to receive or take your Social Security check, you're not required to take a welfare payment.
[01:58:10.756 --> 01:58:14.338]  But anything that does have a requirement to it is backed up by the barrel of a gun.
[01:58:15.302 --> 01:58:17.423]  OK, that's all we've got time for.
[01:58:17.463 --> 01:58:18.123]  Thanks, Mark.
[01:58:18.844 --> 01:58:21.225]  Joel Skousen, great for you to be on the show today.
[01:58:21.265 --> 01:58:22.305]  We'll talk to you later.
