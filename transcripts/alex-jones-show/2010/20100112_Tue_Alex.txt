[00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:05.086]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.747 --> 00:00:06.807]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.528 --> 00:00:08.608]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.089]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:11.750]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.092]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.613 --> 00:00:20.655]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.632 --> 00:00:30.656]  Well, a lot of you know him from Jesse Ventura's top-rated show on TruTV.
[00:00:31.077 --> 00:00:36.742]  I recommended him for the research episode, Secret Societies Global Death Plot.
[00:00:38.817 --> 00:00:41.520]  And I believe that's his maiden voyage on national television.
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.107]  And it's his first time joining us here on the radio for this hour, perhaps a little bit of the next hour.
[00:00:47.127 --> 00:00:52.533]  We're going to be playing key audio clips that he recorded at conferences he attended and put on.
[00:00:52.593 --> 00:00:58.099]  He was the head of many of these high-powered conferences with Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Maurice Strong.
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:13.057]  And so joining us is George Washington Hunt, served as a naval officer, consulted to major companies, headed up with the World Conservation Society's World Conservation Bank, was a big part of that, working with the United Nations.
[00:01:13.858 --> 00:01:16.441]  He's done so much out of the gates here.
[00:01:17.102 --> 00:01:17.602]  I'm glad to be here, Alex.
[00:01:17.622 --> 00:01:21.084]  Every chance I get to spread the bad news, that's my job.
[00:01:46.192 --> 00:01:53.098]  Well, you know, people sometimes... I went to the Fourth World Wilderness Congress on September 11, 1987.
[00:01:54.239 --> 00:02:06.190]  I went there because my son had been killed in a wilderness area the later part of the year, or about a few months before.
[00:02:07.452 --> 00:02:20.096]  I was very sad, and also my other son that was still living said he wanted to repair huts along the Arctic for travelers, and he wanted to get into a job.
[00:02:20.196 --> 00:02:34.061]  So I heard the Fourth World Wilderness was coming to town, and with all its reindeer and pretty little bright lights, and I said, you know, maybe I could go there and rub the shoulders with the Smokies, with the forest rangers, and get my son a job.
[00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:40.411]  And so I went down to the Congress and I saw the pictures of the reindeer and so on.
[00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:46.873]  But then I noticed on the program that there was another aspect away from Denver.
[00:02:47.013 --> 00:02:55.576]  The first two days of this Wilderness Congress, it's supposed to be pro-conservation, the first two days were in Denver.
[00:02:55.936 --> 00:03:04.419]  And then they moved a quasi-secret meeting up to the YMCA of Estes Park, Colorado.
[00:03:05.524 --> 00:03:16.012]  So, with my resourceful mind, I said to myself, I'd like to get into that Congress, but I didn't have any money.
[00:03:16.893 --> 00:03:26.300]  And then, lo and behold, I got the information that one of the official hosts of the meeting was ill with the flu.
[00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:28.161]  I got his number.
[00:03:28.502 --> 00:03:29.142]  I called him.
[00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:30.944]  He says, yeah, take my place.
[00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.926]  I was interviewed by about four
[00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.852]  Poor people, among them were psychics, and they approved me as an official host.
[00:03:41.552 --> 00:03:50.934]  Now that shows how weird these groups are, because Maury Strong also has a wilderness retreat, like Bohemian Grove similar, where they admittedly do a lot of bizarre activities.
[00:03:51.014 --> 00:03:54.835]  So everywhere they go, there's always psychics and the occult involved.
[00:03:55.975 --> 00:03:58.076]  Yes, well they were involved here too Alex.
[00:03:58.743 --> 00:03:59.844]  They all run together.
[00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:05.390]  The psychics, the cults, the witches, the devils, the...
[00:04:09.093 --> 00:04:11.875]  The near-rich that want to get into the crowd.
[00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:13.835]  It's a whole mishmash.
[00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:15.856]  And there's video of this that you shot.
[00:04:16.377 --> 00:04:19.038]  Over time, you became the leader of the conferences.
[00:04:19.078 --> 00:04:20.038]  And we're going to get into that.
[00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.499]  How these twists of fate got you in this position.
[00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:23.720]  So we're going to break in a moment.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.761]  Let's come back with George Hunt.
[00:04:27.402 --> 00:04:27.842]  Goes.
[00:04:28.242 --> 00:04:29.643]  He wants a spot at this event.
[00:04:30.563 --> 00:04:31.764]  This conservation event.
[00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.965]  You end up getting one of the places of one of the hosts.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.962]  And then suddenly you're with Rothschilds, Rockefellers.
[00:04:38.302 --> 00:04:39.242]  How did this happen?
[00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:42.524]  You're approved by psychics to be able to go by them.
[00:04:43.544 --> 00:04:45.445]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[00:04:45.645 --> 00:04:52.749]  And I've done separate research from George Hunt, confirming what he said about Maury Strong and others.
[00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:56.671]  They want a one-world religion, as Al Gore is now openly saying.
[00:04:56.691 --> 00:04:58.332]  We'll be right back with George Hunt.
[00:04:59.482 --> 00:05:03.724]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.024 --> 00:05:04.645]  Number one.
[00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:08.107]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:08.367 --> 00:05:08.927]  Number two.
[00:05:09.227 --> 00:05:13.790]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.570]  It's true.
[00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.413]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:19.733 --> 00:05:20.274]  Number 3.
[00:05:20.554 --> 00:05:23.836]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.137 --> 00:05:27.879]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.620]  Number 4.
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.222]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:31.622 --> 00:05:35.005]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.305 --> 00:05:35.505]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:40.009]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.993]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:45.273 --> 00:05:49.297]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:49.437 --> 00:05:51.019]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.239 --> 00:05:53.321]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:05:53.481 --> 00:05:55.824]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:01.192 --> 00:06:04.793]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:13.274]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:06:13.994 --> 00:06:18.055]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:06:18.615 --> 00:06:29.437]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:06:30.077 --> 00:06:39.079]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:44.620]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:52.202]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:52.502 --> 00:06:55.263]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.812]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:07:03.932 --> 00:07:06.673]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:07:06.813 --> 00:07:08.774]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:07:08.894 --> 00:07:11.015]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:07:11.135 --> 00:07:12.656]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:07:12.796 --> 00:07:17.138]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:07:17.258 --> 00:07:19.539]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:25.624]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[00:07:25.844 --> 00:07:30.588]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:07:30.628 --> 00:07:33.371]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:36.093]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:07:36.193 --> 00:07:37.534]  This system is free of chemicals.
[00:07:37.534 --> 00:07:39.915]  He's set to meet the man who pulls together all the threads, George Hunt.
[00:08:09.206 --> 00:08:13.612]  It's not truly really about saving the planet from carbon dioxide.
[00:08:13.933 --> 00:08:15.155]  It's about making money.
[00:08:15.435 --> 00:08:17.538]  At an international level.
[00:08:17.878 --> 00:08:20.702]  We're not even talking here about country, country, country.
[00:08:21.023 --> 00:08:24.708]  We're talking about a global type money making thing, correct?
[00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.209]  Yes.
[00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:39.257]  We're talking about a powerful, immense aristocracy that has the intention of using the fear of the environment deteriorating.
[00:08:39.457 --> 00:08:41.719]  They're going to use it to take over the world.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.263]  George Hunt was an official at the World Wilderness Congress when he met Maurice Strong in 1987.
[00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:54.566]  The Congress is an international forum for discussing the environment.
[00:08:55.959 --> 00:09:08.469]  But Maury Strong showed up to introduce a new player, financier Edmund de Rothschild of the Rothschild banking dynasty, and a proposal to create something called a World Conservation Bank.
[00:09:10.465 --> 00:09:19.049]  One of the most important initiatives that is open here is that of the Conservation Banking Program.
[00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:30.433]  We have as our chairman, fortunately, the person who epitomizes that positive synthesis between environment, conservation, on the one hand, and economics on the other.
[00:09:31.134 --> 00:09:36.976]  And I'm just delighted to have this opportunity of introducing to you Edmund De Rothschild.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:49.103]  Maury Strong was in charge of the conservation movement, but he was also Edmund de Rothschild's right-hand man.
[00:09:49.664 --> 00:09:55.826]  You have money and the environment in one person, Edmund de Rothschild.
[00:09:56.626 --> 00:09:59.367]  Now Maury Strong, I found out during...
[00:10:03.351 --> 00:10:06.055]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live with the rest of the hour.
[00:10:06.075 --> 00:10:07.256]  A little bit of the next hour.
[00:10:08.178 --> 00:10:11.182]  George Hunt is our guest to go in depth.
[00:10:11.482 --> 00:10:15.327]  So, he's just looking into conservation jobs for his son.
[00:10:17.585 --> 00:10:19.027]  One of the presenters is sick.
[00:10:19.447 --> 00:10:20.548]  He says, I'd like to go.
[00:10:21.068 --> 00:10:24.111]  Suddenly, he's being vetted by them by psychics.
[00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:30.837]  And from my separate research, this is on record, Maury Strong has a weird cult compound in Colorado.
[00:10:30.857 --> 00:10:32.258]  It ties into Bohemian Grove.
[00:10:32.638 --> 00:10:34.180]  The U.N., of course, is into the occult.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:34.980]  He brought that up.
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:35.941]  That's coming up later.
[00:10:36.462 --> 00:10:41.206]  OK, going back to George Hunt, naval officer, corporate businessman.
[00:10:42.867 --> 00:10:44.228]  Yes, I had luncheon with the Rothschilds.
[00:10:44.268 --> 00:10:45.409]  They were very nice people.
[00:11:07.871 --> 00:11:12.757]  Lady Ross Child stood up when I came to the table and she filled my glass.
[00:11:13.338 --> 00:11:19.505]  And suddenly I said, thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies, my cup runneth over.
[00:11:19.525 --> 00:11:23.670]  And I was with the president of the World Conservation Bank.
[00:11:24.131 --> 00:11:26.674]  And I said, Michael,
[00:11:27.556 --> 00:11:34.843]  Sweetman, how is this bank going to survive if the asset base is Arctic lands?
[00:11:35.143 --> 00:11:37.405]  They don't produce any dividends and interest.
[00:11:37.725 --> 00:11:39.647]  He says, oh, we are worried.
[00:11:40.047 --> 00:11:44.030]  We are working on that, he said in his precise English.
[00:11:44.451 --> 00:11:45.692]  I said, you're working on it?
[00:11:45.812 --> 00:11:51.597]  You're going to have a seminar in a half an hour where you're going to accept this bank?
[00:11:52.177 --> 00:11:53.479]  What's going on, Michael?
[00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:57.743]  He said, you'll have a chance to ask us at the seminar.
[00:11:58.284 --> 00:12:01.127]  I looked him in the eye and said, Michael, are you going to call on me?
[00:12:01.587 --> 00:12:02.728]  Looked me in the eye, Michael.
[00:12:03.069 --> 00:12:03.909]  Yes, I promised.
[00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.493]  Well, when we went to the seminar, and of course, he didn't call on me.
[00:12:07.954 --> 00:12:11.097]  It was a contrived Congress, and they accepted the bank.
[00:12:12.313 --> 00:12:15.076]  And we haven't seen it yet, but it's coming down the road.
[00:12:15.616 --> 00:12:19.880]  There'll be one bank, one credit card, one of everything.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:29.489]  And if you cross that bank and don't do what they want, or the owners want, you'll lose your credit card privilege and you won't be able to buy or sell.
[00:12:30.379 --> 00:12:35.224]  Now let's fast forward 24 years, or 23 years to 2010.
[00:12:35.885 --> 00:12:41.952]  I now have London Guardian, Associated Press headlines, Rothschild's established global environment bank.
[00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:45.015]  Rothschild's established global carbon credit bank.
[00:12:45.495 --> 00:12:51.262]  It's now mainstream news what you whistle blew on decades ago, after you got deeper into the groups.
[00:12:51.282 --> 00:12:52.103]  We're going to cover that.
[00:12:52.523 --> 00:12:54.045]  Yes, that's what I want people to wake up at.
[00:12:54.085 --> 00:12:55.286]  This is a conspiracy going on.
[00:12:55.546 --> 00:12:57.929]  It's no longer a conspiracy theory.
[00:12:57.989 --> 00:12:59.030]  It's a conspiracy fact.
[00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:15.949]  Okay, so continue.
[00:13:16.029 --> 00:13:24.253]  So you're at the meeting, you're at the table with the Rothschilds, because by twist of fate, you got the ticket or the seat of one of the presenters who had the flu.
[00:13:24.333 --> 00:13:25.653]  Go ahead.
[00:13:26.374 --> 00:13:36.038]  Then my fellow workers came up to me and they said, George, we have to talk to you about something.
[00:13:36.478 --> 00:13:41.240]  David Rockefeller has sent us a message that if you don't keep your mouth shut, you're going to regret it.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.841]  Shortly after that,
[00:13:44.523 --> 00:13:50.345]  After the meeting, I was talking with a talk show host and he said, did you get Guillain-Barré syndrome yet?
[00:13:50.765 --> 00:13:52.125]  And I said, what are you talking about?
[00:13:52.726 --> 00:13:53.726]  He said, GBS.
[00:13:54.186 --> 00:13:57.627]  It seems like everyone that gets close to the bone with World Order gets it.
[00:13:58.127 --> 00:14:00.868]  Well, I just got out of the hospital with GBS.
[00:14:01.148 --> 00:14:03.889]  So there's something there, don't you think?
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:14.648]  We know they have a lot of programs with soft kill weapons, but expanding on this, because you got the video out of there at other events, so out of the gate... I got the tape of the events.
[00:14:15.009 --> 00:14:17.451]  As far as I know, it's the only tape in existence.
[00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:19.611]  I can't figure that out.
[00:14:43.213 --> 00:14:45.614]  First of all, I hadn't done anything wrong, though.
[00:14:45.975 --> 00:14:47.395]  I was an official host.
[00:14:47.695 --> 00:14:50.617]  So why was David Rockefeller telling you to shut up?
[00:14:51.157 --> 00:14:57.880]  I had a regular association with Maury Strong there.
[00:14:59.581 --> 00:15:01.602]  Then, after the Congress, I went down.
[00:15:02.222 --> 00:15:05.144]  Some Christians down in San Luis Valley called me.
[00:15:05.484 --> 00:15:07.265]  They said, George, you have to come down here.
[00:15:07.345 --> 00:15:09.606]  Maury Strong is up to all kinds of tricks.
[00:15:10.439 --> 00:15:23.843]  And that's where I was able to, through them, expose Maurice Strong's water scam that he was going to pump water to cities and turn the San Luis Valley, thousands of miles, into a dust bowl.
[00:15:24.284 --> 00:15:37.268]  So here's the convener of the Environment Congress that met in Estes Park, going down 200 miles to the San Luis Valley and turning the place into a dust bowl.
[00:15:37.868 --> 00:15:46.782]  It was that hypocrisy that caused me to invest up to now $250,000 in exposing this guy.
[00:15:47.182 --> 00:15:53.432]  And I've got some information today for you that is going to blow him out of the water.
[00:15:57.088 --> 00:15:57.589]  Amazing.
[00:15:57.649 --> 00:16:07.137]  So again, now we see it all over the news, how the UN and big corporations are grabbing up the water in the third world, the first world, developing world, cutting it off.
[00:16:07.177 --> 00:16:08.719]  That's now mainstream news.
[00:16:09.119 --> 00:16:13.363]  Here you are in the late 80s seeing this at its embryonic formation.
[00:16:14.264 --> 00:16:14.544]  Yes.
[00:16:15.205 --> 00:16:18.648]  I saw it as an embryo and now I'm seeing it as an ugly fetus.
[00:16:20.953 --> 00:16:26.101]  Now from the videos and audios I've seen of you, you then found out about this.
[00:16:26.322 --> 00:16:28.545]  We'll continue with that first conference, what they said.
[00:16:28.565 --> 00:16:31.170]  We've got a bunch of audio clips here.
[00:16:31.731 --> 00:16:35.377]  But continue into other meetings that you were able to infiltrate.
[00:16:37.009 --> 00:16:58.114]  Oh, I've infiltrated many meetings, but not one of this importance, because the Secretary of the Treasury, Baker, was there, the head of the IMF, the head of the World Bank, Rothschild, Edmund Rothschild, the chief banker of the world, David Rockefeller, da-da-da-da, and I knew there was something going on.
[00:16:58.294 --> 00:17:00.915]  It would take an idiot not to understand it.
[00:17:01.853 --> 00:17:04.275]  And again, you're on record as being part of the conference.
[00:17:04.295 --> 00:17:05.637]  You got the documents out.
[00:17:06.598 --> 00:17:09.720]  Later newspapers, major newspapers have written stories about it.
[00:17:10.441 --> 00:17:12.603]  On the Ventura TV show, they showed those.
[00:17:13.003 --> 00:17:16.406]  I mean, this was a stroke of divine intervention.
[00:17:17.147 --> 00:17:17.708]  It was God.
[00:17:17.848 --> 00:17:20.850]  It was what you call an incident, coincidence.
[00:17:21.551 --> 00:17:26.836]  Because I received a prophecy in the Christian Church about 12 years earlier that I was going to do this.
[00:17:27.774 --> 00:17:30.036]  So it was, it was a piece of cake.
[00:17:30.176 --> 00:17:34.561]  I walked through it without any fear and knowing that God was on my side.
[00:17:34.801 --> 00:17:42.789]  Wait a minute, so someone told you specifically or did you recognize what was happening as it was happening or did you like after the fact go, oh my God?
[00:17:43.329 --> 00:17:44.711]  It was later after the fact.
[00:17:45.151 --> 00:17:46.152]  This is a prophecy.
[00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:48.594]  We are going into the wilderness.
[00:17:49.215 --> 00:17:51.998]  We are going on an adventure together into the wilderness.
[00:17:53.837 --> 00:18:02.463]  I am going to loose you upon the ravenous beasts of the world and then you will return to me and I will protect you.
[00:18:02.483 --> 00:18:05.165]  I am your jailer for your good and mine.
[00:18:05.565 --> 00:18:06.766]  And that was the prophecy.
[00:18:07.126 --> 00:18:16.053]  And then after I went to the Wilderness Congress, I realized I had been in the wilderness and he was loosening me up on the ravenous beasts of the world.
[00:18:16.553 --> 00:18:17.774]  I knew them face to face.
[00:18:18.829 --> 00:18:19.229]  Amazing.
[00:18:19.269 --> 00:18:22.231]  Now, let's go back to this meeting, though, this key meeting you got into.
[00:18:22.691 --> 00:18:24.312]  Then you went and witnessed their sub-meetings.
[00:18:24.653 --> 00:18:28.735]  So, go over again the date, the time, the place, and who was there.
[00:18:30.196 --> 00:18:30.576]  Okay.
[00:18:32.157 --> 00:18:44.725]  David Rockefeller, Edmund de Rothschild, Secretary of the Treasury Baker, head of the IMF, don't remember his name, head of the World Bank, the head of the United Nations in Geneva.
[00:18:45.065 --> 00:18:46.346]  I had dinner with him one night.
[00:18:47.667 --> 00:18:48.227]  He kind of
[00:18:49.403 --> 00:18:53.305]  Found out that my questions were a little too close to the bone.
[00:18:54.565 --> 00:18:58.507]  Then there were the Smokies were there, all the four strangers.
[00:18:59.867 --> 00:19:05.210]  Of course, Maureen Strong was there as a Secretary General convening this Congress.
[00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:17.234]  And Gro Harlem Bruteland, I think of her as kind of a concentration camp lady because she's in charge of reducing the population of the world.
[00:19:17.294 --> 00:19:18.395]  That's what her job is.
[00:19:19.376 --> 00:19:22.957]  She was the head of the World Health Organization for about six years.
[00:19:23.637 --> 00:19:32.679]  And she is also a member of a new club with Jimmy Carter and Tutu and some other people.
[00:19:32.979 --> 00:19:34.519]  It's called The Elders.
[00:19:35.199 --> 00:19:39.800]  And The Elders have direct contact with the Club of Rome.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.180]  All right, stay there.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:41.801]  We got a break.
[00:19:41.821 --> 00:19:43.461]  Let's continue along that line.
[00:19:44.221 --> 00:19:45.661]  And then other meetings you went to.
[00:19:45.681 --> 00:19:48.302]  Just amazing stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:50.134 --> 00:19:56.342]  I mean, there's videos out there of our guests introducing Maury Strong and the rest of them right in the middle of all of this.
[00:19:56.382 --> 00:19:58.765]  This is an absolute eyewitness on the inside.
[00:20:00.444 --> 00:20:04.706]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.
[00:20:05.046 --> 00:20:12.589]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.

[00:20:37.461 --> 00:20:41.042]  That's right, three sport Berkey water bottles and free shipping.

[00:21:00.282 --> 00:21:00.642]  Good day.
[00:21:00.862 --> 00:21:02.343]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:21:02.683 --> 00:21:03.064]  January 12, 2010.
[00:21:03.144 --> 00:21:04.244]  Gold opened this morning at $1149.40.
[00:21:04.384 --> 00:21:08.286]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1180.55, $590.27 for a half-ounce, or $295.14 for the quarter-ounce.
[00:21:08.326 --> 00:21:08.646]  That's $1180.55, $590.27, or $295.14.
[00:21:19.572 --> 00:21:33.102]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[00:21:33.202 --> 00:21:41.769]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:42.989]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:43.109 --> 00:21:47.271]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:48.411]  Call for your copy.
[00:21:48.431 --> 00:21:48.671]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.731 --> 00:21:53.292]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[00:21:53.372 --> 00:21:54.213]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.173 --> 00:21:59.054]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.174 --> 00:22:04.816]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:22:05.156 --> 00:22:08.176]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:22:08.417 --> 00:22:09.837]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:22:10.552 --> 00:22:13.194]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:13.214 --> 00:22:19.398]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:19.598 --> 00:22:24.621]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:22:24.801 --> 00:22:27.943]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:22:28.063 --> 00:22:34.767]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:22:34.887 --> 00:22:37.008]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:22:37.248 --> 00:22:38.569]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:38.829 --> 00:22:41.110]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.130]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:22:43.411 --> 00:22:48.233]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:22:48.573 --> 00:22:57.677]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:02.072]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[00:23:02.192 --> 00:23:03.933]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[00:23:04.093 --> 00:23:05.874]  No More Mortgage can change your life.
[00:23:05.934 --> 00:23:07.275]  We paid off all of our bills.
[00:23:07.375 --> 00:23:10.116]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[00:23:10.157 --> 00:23:15.740]  With No More Mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.401]  Even have more money left over each month?
[00:23:17.481 --> 00:23:20.043]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[00:23:20.083 --> 00:23:20.563]  No More Mortgage.
[00:23:22.584 --> 00:23:23.805]  Where have they been all of our life?
[00:23:23.865 --> 00:23:26.306]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[00:23:26.366 --> 00:23:30.008]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[00:23:30.249 --> 00:23:32.370]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.
[00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:37.653]  This is unlike anything you have ever seen before, and it will absolutely not harm your credit.

[00:23:47.218 --> 00:23:47.258]  800-578-6279.
[00:23:47.318 --> 00:23:47.699]  This works.
[00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:52.262]  Call the number.
[00:23:52.302 --> 00:23:53.303]  Call now for your free CD.

[00:23:53.523 --> 00:23:53.623]  800-578-6279.
[00:23:53.683 --> 00:23:56.405]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:23:56.425 --> 00:23:57.547]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:30.537 --> 00:24:34.539]  Okay, George, I've been throwing a lot of questions in here, and you're dropping bombshell after bombshell.
[00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:35.739]  So you're at this U.N.
[00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:36.399]  conference.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:44.922]  Of course, Maurice Strong was later the head of the official biological diversity meeting in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, the Earth Summit.
[00:24:46.463 --> 00:24:47.944]  Yes, her name is Gro Harlem Brundtland.
[00:24:47.964 --> 00:24:49.104]  She prepared the Brundtland Report
[00:25:14.628 --> 00:25:23.495]  Which was used as the basis of the 4th World Wilderness Congress Foundation, the Broodland Report.
[00:25:24.156 --> 00:25:30.741]  And her analysis is that 2 billion people have to be removed from the planet.
[00:25:30.761 --> 00:25:32.743]  2 billion.
[00:25:33.984 --> 00:25:37.127]  Now there's other figures that go down as low as 500 million.
[00:25:38.628 --> 00:25:41.210]  So we have a sinister element
[00:25:44.295 --> 00:25:50.803]  In our government that is twisting the law so that they can annihilate people early.
[00:25:52.025 --> 00:25:57.772]  They say the globe, the Earth, is not large enough for six billion people.
[00:25:58.713 --> 00:26:02.698]  Now, I take issue with that because I'm one of the guys that will be cooked.
[00:26:03.638 --> 00:26:07.201]  So you can see I do have a selfish motive in fighting all this stuff.
[00:26:07.221 --> 00:26:16.128]  Well, plus it's a fraudulent model and it's been proven these globalists have bigger carbon footprints and more children than even third world populations.
[00:26:16.168 --> 00:26:19.671]  I mean, these are a bunch of greedy people that want the earth for themselves.
[00:26:20.812 --> 00:26:22.594]  Yes, they want the earth for themselves.
[00:26:23.194 --> 00:26:24.575]  You got it right on the head.
[00:26:25.516 --> 00:26:29.840]  And they don't like us cannon fodder that unfortunately populates the earth.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.381]  I've got a recording of that.
[00:26:32.396 --> 00:26:37.540]  Actually, an elitist banker from Canada actually saying that.
[00:26:38.161 --> 00:26:48.589]  Let's do this bank without telling the cannon fodder about it that unfortunately inhabits the earth.
[00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.593]  That's when I said, I'm going to make war on these guys.
[00:26:53.353 --> 00:26:54.654]  And I haven't stopped for 22 years.
[00:26:57.588 --> 00:26:59.750]  Well, you've done a great job exposing him.
[00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:01.651]  I want to continue here.
[00:27:01.671 --> 00:27:02.452]  Okay.
[00:27:03.793 --> 00:27:07.756]  So how did the conference end, and then what other conferences did you attend?
[00:27:09.898 --> 00:27:10.318]  Okay.
[00:27:10.778 --> 00:27:24.129]  The Congress ended by Rothschild presenting his banking program to the Congress to grow Harlem Bruinland to present to the United Nations in October of 1987.
[00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:29.391]  That was the end of it.
[00:27:30.292 --> 00:27:41.602]  Now, since then, you know, everyone's complaining about Maury Strong allegedly taking a $1 million bribe from the U.N.
[00:27:41.662 --> 00:27:53.653]  and the Oil for Food program, and Fox just fouled him up by exposing him to the new world, to that
[00:27:55.544 --> 00:27:55.784]  I think.
[00:28:09.767 --> 00:28:30.130]  In other words, it seems to me that there was fraud committed, either at the Nature Conservancy level or Cabeza de Vaca Land Company level, but someone can easily find that $8 million that he got, and I hereby blow the whistle on it.
[00:28:30.814 --> 00:28:39.181]  Well here's that Fox News report on global warming, follow the money, and it talks about Maury Strong and everything he's been involved in.
[00:28:39.522 --> 00:28:47.569]  And I know these fake conservancy groups in Austin with the city took more than 15,000 acres from people and didn't pay them one-tenth of what it was worth.
[00:28:47.889 --> 00:28:52.473]  Then they turned around a few years later and took the restrictions off and built on it themselves.
[00:28:53.493 --> 00:28:55.174]  See, that's the kind of stuff they do.
[00:28:55.254 --> 00:29:06.422]  They manure themselves through these institutions and acronymical corporations like ABC Corporation, and you can't follow their trail.
[00:29:07.703 --> 00:29:17.169]  Maurice Strong tried to bury his trail when he left the United States in a hurry, because I reported him to the Congress.
[00:29:17.611 --> 00:29:17.791]  Yeah.
[00:29:33.149 --> 00:29:34.050]  Until 2 a.m.
[00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.610]  in the morning.
[00:29:35.091 --> 00:29:46.119]  If I had written to them, they would have passed it and AWDI, Maury Strong's company, would have been off and rolling to... Alright, George, stay there.
[00:29:46.199 --> 00:29:47.320]  Good job fighting that.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.561]  Long segment coming up.
[00:29:50.202 --> 00:29:51.122]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:53.224]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.145 --> 00:29:56.827]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:04.313]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:04.693 --> 00:30:07.697]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:07.937 --> 00:30:12.722]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:30:12.742 --> 00:30:18.969]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:19.129 --> 00:30:21.372]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:21.852 --> 00:30:22.172]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:22.192 --> 00:30:22.613]  Bernanke?
[00:30:22.713 --> 00:30:23.293]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:23.333 --> 00:30:24.014]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:24.034 --> 00:30:26.156]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:40.788 --> 00:30:42.630]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:47.776]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:30:48.076 --> 00:30:57.186]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:30:59.926 --> 00:31:02.548]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:02.948 --> 00:31:07.912]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:08.273 --> 00:31:10.014]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:10.334 --> 00:31:15.138]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:15.338 --> 00:31:16.299]  How much do you want?
[00:31:16.499 --> 00:31:17.260]  When do you want it?
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.241]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:19.521 --> 00:31:20.342]  When will you need it?
[00:31:20.602 --> 00:31:22.664]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:22.804 --> 00:31:23.905]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:24.145 --> 00:31:25.446]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:25.646 --> 00:31:30.730]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:34.112]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:37.995]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:38.315 --> 00:31:39.316]  How much will you need?
[00:31:39.556 --> 00:31:40.157]  We don't know.
[00:31:40.457 --> 00:31:41.357]  How much do you want?
[00:31:41.558 --> 00:31:42.298]  All you can get.
[00:31:42.498 --> 00:31:43.299]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:43.579 --> 00:31:46.342]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:31:46.623 --> 00:31:48.825]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:31:48.865 --> 00:31:49.826]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:59.281 --> 00:32:00.282]  What's your home worth?
[00:32:00.442 --> 00:32:02.385]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:32:02.565 --> 00:32:05.309]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:32:05.609 --> 00:32:13.118]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of the tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[00:32:13.319 --> 00:32:16.763]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[00:33:13.197 --> 00:33:16.559]  TheBigBadBank.com is his website.
[00:33:16.579 --> 00:33:17.399]  He's George Hunt.
[00:33:17.479 --> 00:33:20.361]  Again, TheBigBadBank.com.
[00:33:20.621 --> 00:33:21.121]  One word.
[00:33:21.701 --> 00:33:22.141]  Check it out.
[00:33:22.161 --> 00:33:25.923]  We'll tell you about a great documentary he produced coming up later that you can get on the site.
[00:33:26.444 --> 00:33:27.664]  TheBigBadBank.com.
[00:33:27.684 --> 00:33:34.668]  Of course, our websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, as well as InfoWars.net.
[00:33:35.028 --> 00:33:36.669]  And what is TheEndgame.com?
[00:33:36.689 --> 00:33:40.911]  My film, Endgame, exposes this globalist dehumanization agenda
[00:33:41.431 --> 00:33:43.812]  That they're pushing through the phony environmental movement.
[00:33:44.132 --> 00:33:46.192]  This is the religion of the big bankers.
[00:33:46.492 --> 00:33:48.733]  We're going to get into their religion, what makes them tick.
[00:33:48.773 --> 00:33:55.095]  George Hunt has tracked them, been in their meetings, been around them by a twist of fate and the good lord above.
[00:33:55.115 --> 00:34:00.616]  We've got a bunch of audio clips we're going to be playing and getting his take on that as well.
[00:34:01.176 --> 00:34:07.698]  But for years he was exposing Maury Strong before it ever even became a mainstream media issue.
[00:34:07.718 --> 00:34:10.279]  But give me a document cam shot for
[00:34:11.428 --> 00:34:14.670]  PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and for radio listeners, I'll give you these headlines.
[00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:16.432]  You can check them out for yourself.
[00:34:17.452 --> 00:34:23.677]  The article he mentioned from Fox with Maury Strong being confronted by the news for making lots of money off of Copenhagen.
[00:34:24.377 --> 00:34:25.598]  So that's going on.
[00:34:26.419 --> 00:34:27.820]  Here's an article out of Reuters.
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:33.384]  Rothschild E3 launched carbon credit investment fund that people will pay their taxes to.
[00:34:33.444 --> 00:34:34.224]  That's Reuters.
[00:34:35.245 --> 00:34:37.367]  Everything he was talking about 20 years ago.
[00:34:39.026 --> 00:34:39.547]  Here's another one.
[00:34:39.567 --> 00:34:42.729]  Maury Strong linked to all these bizarre cults.
[00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:45.852]  We're going to be covering that with him as well.
[00:34:45.932 --> 00:34:48.634]  His wife setting up a Gaia Earth religion.
[00:34:48.674 --> 00:34:57.441]  The UN said in 96 in their biological diversity assessment, and I even have a clip of them at the UN saying, we must worship our mother goddess.
[00:34:58.141 --> 00:35:02.585]  And now they're teaching the children these chants in public schools and private schools that are accredited.
[00:35:02.925 --> 00:35:05.007]  And they now admit it's going to be a global religion.
[00:35:05.527 --> 00:35:05.848]  In fact,
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.461]  Where are those magazines I had in here?
[00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:09.702]  I guess I've already cleaned it up.
[00:35:09.742 --> 00:35:11.343]  Will you ask Aaron, because he took them out?
[00:35:11.383 --> 00:35:11.684]  No, no, no.
[00:35:11.724 --> 00:35:12.084]  Here they are.
[00:35:12.664 --> 00:35:13.065]  Here they are.
[00:35:14.186 --> 00:35:14.586]  Look at this.
[00:35:15.707 --> 00:35:17.648]  There's so many of these, I just thought to show you this.
[00:35:18.289 --> 00:35:28.357]  Here is Outside Magazine likening the new heir to the Rothschild family, the son of the person that George Hunt was exposing.
[00:35:30.148 --> 00:35:33.490]  Here he is, the hero Gene, how to tap into yours.
[00:35:34.151 --> 00:35:37.353]  And then you open it up and it talks about him being like Jesus.
[00:35:38.754 --> 00:35:44.117]  You open it up and it talks about him being a Christ figure.
[00:35:45.298 --> 00:35:49.140]  I mean, this is just so incredibly sickening.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.321]  They call him Jesus here.
[00:35:50.361 --> 00:35:51.342]  Give me a close shot of this.
[00:35:51.722 --> 00:35:54.323]  Plastics Jesus, the Savior.
[00:35:54.664 --> 00:35:55.324]  How to be a hero.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.921]  Again, here they are on the cover of the magazine.
[00:36:01.961 --> 00:36:02.882]  The hero gene.
[00:36:03.182 --> 00:36:04.083]  How to tap into yours.
[00:36:04.123 --> 00:36:05.203]  This is your role model.
[00:36:05.604 --> 00:36:06.864]  A guy that got on my show.
[00:36:07.305 --> 00:36:11.047]  He's openly called for global government, by the way, at Copenhagen on Bloomberg TV.
[00:36:11.627 --> 00:36:17.892]  A guy got on my show and I said, well, Mars' ice caps have been getting smaller, too, from solar system warming from the sun.
[00:36:17.972 --> 00:36:19.593]  He said, well, that's because Mars is closer
[00:36:20.273 --> 00:36:21.514]  To the sun and earth.
[00:36:21.554 --> 00:36:23.555]  And I said, no it's not, it's the next planet out.
[00:36:23.915 --> 00:36:24.896]  Then it's the gas giants.
[00:36:24.936 --> 00:36:26.497]  He said, no it's not, and laughed at me.
[00:36:26.857 --> 00:36:28.278]  He was laughing at the audience.
[00:36:28.318 --> 00:36:29.879]  He thinks you're like the general public.
[00:36:30.299 --> 00:36:30.860]  Here's another one.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.441]  The thinking man's thinking man.
[00:36:32.861 --> 00:36:34.722]  The eco-prophet gets real.
[00:36:35.202 --> 00:36:35.783]  Al Gore.
[00:36:36.283 --> 00:36:37.444]  See, he's a prophet.
[00:36:38.004 --> 00:36:39.065]  It's all a religion.
[00:36:39.265 --> 00:36:40.266]  But that's coming up.
[00:36:40.626 --> 00:36:44.048]  And he's going to be with us at least 20 minutes to the next hour because there's so many facets to cover.
[00:36:44.428 --> 00:36:48.271]  George Hunt, before we get into the religious angle and the scams they're running,
[00:36:49.091 --> 00:37:02.439]  I want to play some audio clips and get into some of the other questions you sent me that you think are important to get into, but working with them, being around them, and finding out who they were, tracking them, what is their bottom line?
[00:37:03.159 --> 00:37:14.426]  I mean, I don't know if you've seen my film, Endgame, but from the UN documents, from their statements, it's a planetary dictatorship to then carry out the orderly extermination of at least 80% of the world population.
[00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:17.668]  You know, you caught me
[00:37:19.508 --> 00:37:20.449]  At a standstill.
[00:37:20.589 --> 00:37:22.871]  I'm not familiar with that.
[00:37:23.752 --> 00:37:26.274]  Well, I need to send you a copy of my film, Endgame.
[00:37:26.534 --> 00:37:29.897]  But specifically, there are plans for population reduction.
[00:37:29.917 --> 00:37:30.938]  Did you ever run into that?
[00:37:32.439 --> 00:37:34.560]  Well, I have.
[00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:35.401]  Yes, I have.
[00:37:35.501 --> 00:37:38.203]  But it's rather grim.
[00:37:39.084 --> 00:37:44.689]  I believe that the World Health Organization has included an AIDS
[00:37:48.356 --> 00:37:49.116]  Well, they've been caught.
[00:37:49.196 --> 00:37:50.056]  Yes, that's on record.
[00:38:17.798 --> 00:38:23.736]  And, you know, I come across these terrible things that are going on in the planet, even while we speak.
[00:38:23.756 --> 00:38:24.940]  It's terrible.
[00:38:26.049 --> 00:38:35.831]  Well, we know the UN was involved in financing the Rwandan massacre of Christians because they wanted their property for big oil companies and mining companies and financed by banks.
[00:38:36.452 --> 00:38:42.293]  I'm not particularly familiar with the bank you mentioned, but what type of world do they want to build?
[00:38:42.573 --> 00:38:47.634]  And how are they using environmentalism to sell the public on giving up their rights?
[00:38:47.654 --> 00:38:54.456]  They are gearing society towards a feudalistic society, in my opinion.
[00:38:55.242 --> 00:39:04.227]  Where they'll have lords of the manors, the Duchess of Boulder and the Queen of Las Vegas.
[00:39:04.507 --> 00:39:07.829]  You know, they'll adopt titles and stuff.
[00:39:07.849 --> 00:39:12.931]  They'll go into a feudalistic society similar to what we had in the Middle Ages.
[00:39:14.812 --> 00:39:19.695]  And they will also introduce the worship of Mother Earth as part of the religion.
[00:39:21.049 --> 00:39:26.894]  So that we will somehow tie in the religion with acceptance of the world order.
[00:39:28.615 --> 00:39:31.057]  That's all I can say vaguely about where they're headed.
[00:39:32.918 --> 00:39:52.028]  Now I've got these audio clips and then I want to get into some of their religious beliefs and I mean having psychics vet you to be able to go to the conference, the secret conference, I mean just the bizarreness and that sounds crazy to people that don't research them, but openly UN documents talk about the occult and how much they believe in it.
[00:39:52.848 --> 00:39:56.209]  Uh, what would you, how would you sum up their earth religion?
[00:39:56.229 --> 00:39:58.510]  I mean, because that's a broad title, earth religion.
[00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.691]  We see the new movie Avatar, it's all about an earth religion.
[00:40:01.711 --> 00:40:06.513]  Uh, but, but I mean, how would you sum up their, their earth religion?
[00:40:07.374 --> 00:40:13.936]  Honey Strong, Maury Strong's wife, is the head of the earth religion cult.
[00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:23.493]  She—Creston, Colorado has been chosen as the center because that is where the Eastern religions meet the Western religions.
[00:40:23.853 --> 00:40:36.458]  They say that's the point there where God is going to have sexual intercourse with Mother Earth to bring forth the Christ.
[00:40:37.839 --> 00:40:38.779]  That's what they believe!
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:41.800]  Hello?
[00:40:44.807 --> 00:40:45.992]  Did I knock you off your seat?
[00:40:46.495 --> 00:40:47.118]  No, no.
[00:40:47.198 --> 00:40:48.203]  I mean, I'm listening.
[00:40:51.669 --> 00:40:51.930]  No, no, no.
[00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.210]  I mean, I've been to Bohemian Grove.
[00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:54.051]  I infiltrated it.
[00:40:54.131 --> 00:40:58.053]  And they address the owl as an owl, then as a bull, as Moloch.
[00:40:58.454 --> 00:41:00.115]  They address it as male and female.
[00:41:00.175 --> 00:41:01.455]  The owl is the female.
[00:41:01.475 --> 00:41:04.858]  And the cults are all a little bit different.
[00:41:05.278 --> 00:41:06.959]  And then the bull is the male.
[00:41:07.239 --> 00:41:14.944]  And they talk about how they sacrifice children and goodly tire, that's a quote, to the Moloch, the bull.
[00:41:15.004 --> 00:41:16.725]  But then they also address it as a female.
[00:41:17.205 --> 00:41:19.547]  And so they always see it as the horned god, the male.
[00:41:20.475 --> 00:41:23.618]  Yeah, you've got the core of it right there, Alex.
[00:41:23.638 --> 00:41:25.240]  But it's starting in Maury Strong country.
[00:41:42.308 --> 00:41:42.429]  And
[00:41:53.516 --> 00:42:00.960]  Well he's also on audio at huge elementary school conferences and the auditorium is saying, tell your parents what to do.
[00:42:17.248 --> 00:42:18.869]  They don't know you're the boss.
[00:42:18.909 --> 00:42:24.833]  In the New York Times reports, they've got kids all over the country writing mock tickets to their parents for taking a hot bath.
[00:42:25.414 --> 00:42:26.254]  That's what they're going to do.
[00:42:26.334 --> 00:42:29.417]  They're going to train them to blow the whistle on their parents.
[00:42:30.577 --> 00:42:31.678]  Same thing that you read.
[00:42:32.118 --> 00:42:36.001]  I urge your listeners to reread 1984.
[00:42:36.201 --> 00:42:38.123]  There are a lot of parallels there.
[00:42:40.644 --> 00:42:41.965]  Including the earth religion.
[00:42:41.985 --> 00:42:43.486]  In 1984, they worshipped Big Brother.
[00:42:46.388 --> 00:42:48.869]  But in this case, it'll be Big Sister.
[00:42:50.289 --> 00:43:02.433]  Well, we have another article at JonesReport.com that's a scan from this Outside Magazine article, and it's got a photo of David the Rothschild wearing a skull and bones belt.
[00:43:02.853 --> 00:43:06.634]  It says he's Jesus, but he's also wearing a skull and crossbones belt.
[00:43:06.654 --> 00:43:07.234]  What do you think of that?
[00:43:08.217 --> 00:43:13.381]  Well, as a Christian, I would immediately be repulsed by it.
[00:43:13.561 --> 00:43:16.883]  I don't know what he was saying to the public.
[00:43:17.403 --> 00:43:23.908]  I didn't know if he was mocking Jesus Christ like some of the Orthodox Jews do.
[00:43:24.388 --> 00:43:32.794]  But the gist is that they're out to capture the minds of people.
[00:43:33.394 --> 00:43:35.596]  This is a mind game that we're involved in.
[00:43:36.815 --> 00:43:42.682]  Yeah, they use guilt over the environment to sell people into giving up their rights to them.
[00:43:44.103 --> 00:43:51.312]  Giving up their rights to the state, but in this case to Gaia, Mother Earth, and they'll be rewarded for it.
[00:43:51.412 --> 00:43:54.155]  They'll get a razor blade, uh, uh,
[00:43:54.696 --> 00:43:56.517]  By the way, by the way... By the way, I've...
[00:44:16.636 --> 00:44:24.422]  Well, going back to what you just said, the BBC this weekend had a headline, that I showed people yesterday, where they said, rationing is needed.
[00:44:24.742 --> 00:44:34.670]  A credit ration on your card, like you said 20 years ago, that they said, now they're openly proposing, you'll have a card, and it has your rations on it, for everyone, for the Earth.
[00:44:35.091 --> 00:44:38.813]  Every can of corn or beans will have a tax on it as well.
[00:44:39.194 --> 00:44:43.637]  But even if you have the money to buy it, you won't get it when your carbon credits run out.
[00:44:43.657 --> 00:44:45.679]  I mean, this is neo-feudalism, this is serfdom.
[00:44:46.516 --> 00:44:47.017]  That's right.
[00:44:47.377 --> 00:44:54.586]  They're going to tax each each can of beans or corn or or whatever you have.
[00:44:54.786 --> 00:45:00.734]  They're going to determine how much of Mother Earth went into the growth of this product.
[00:45:01.194 --> 00:45:04.058]  And they're going to add that to the cost of the product.
[00:45:05.982 --> 00:45:07.963]  As if life hurts life.
[00:45:08.023 --> 00:45:13.165]  The whole process of life and death and regeneration of food is what the life cycle is.
[00:45:13.225 --> 00:45:20.908]  By taxing carbon dioxide that plants breathe, that all animals exhale, they can corner the entire life cycle.
[00:45:21.648 --> 00:45:22.908]  Yes, that's what they say.
[00:45:24.149 --> 00:45:35.193]  In fact, Rothschild said that he wanted to capture all of the carbon dioxide, turn it into dry ice, and ship the dry ice to the polar caps to keep them from melting.
[00:45:37.142 --> 00:45:38.523]  That's how he's going to take care of it.
[00:45:38.563 --> 00:45:40.545]  And of course he would make the money off of doing that.
[00:45:42.186 --> 00:45:42.887]  Excuse me, go ahead.
[00:45:43.127 --> 00:45:47.631]  And of course he would make the money off of that, like Bill Gates patenting all this stuff to stop carbon dioxide.
[00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:53.256]  Oh yeah, it would take a lot of dry ice to keep the polar caps from melting.
[00:45:53.876 --> 00:45:58.680]  What about Bill and Melinda Gates and their Eugenics Foundation?
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:45:59.461]  Do you ever run into that?
[00:46:00.151 --> 00:46:01.971]  No, I have the Gates Foundation.
[00:46:02.292 --> 00:46:03.552]  No, I haven't run it.
[00:46:03.652 --> 00:46:09.113]  I think it's a specific, it's a passive organization that Bill Gates has.
[00:46:09.653 --> 00:46:13.634]  He doesn't seem like he's a killer or anything like that.
[00:46:13.714 --> 00:46:15.595]  Well, we've done research on it.
[00:46:15.755 --> 00:46:18.175]  It's carefully guarded and we've had some internal whistleblowers.
[00:46:18.195 --> 00:46:27.117]  I mean, you know his dad was the former head of Planned Parenthood and he is for population reduction and he's busy inoculating little children.
[00:46:28.818 --> 00:46:28.878]  Oh.
[00:46:29.758 --> 00:46:30.478]  Didn't know that.
[00:46:50.171 --> 00:46:56.432]  Not to the spiritual part, but just keep on going and maybe I can add some things to your talk.
[00:46:56.773 --> 00:46:58.513]  Okay, you sent me 19 clips.
[00:46:58.673 --> 00:47:09.755]  We can play any of these clips you want, but I'm going to go ahead and play Maury Strong, Banking Principles, because it all sounds slick and sweet and loving, but you can break down what he really means by that.
[00:47:10.035 --> 00:47:14.516]  And now, 27 years later, we can see it's all been proven you were correct in what you got from this.
[00:47:14.556 --> 00:47:17.317]  But here's Maury Strong that you recorded at one of the meetings.
[00:47:17.357 --> 00:47:17.737]  Here it is.
[00:47:18.803 --> 00:47:22.568]  Now, all I'm saying, really, is that there are
[00:47:24.128 --> 00:47:30.553]  There are many areas in which it is possible to apply banking principles.
[00:47:30.773 --> 00:47:32.154]  Michael Sweetman is a banker.
[00:47:32.734 --> 00:47:35.116]  He has run major banking organizations.
[00:47:35.756 --> 00:47:51.988]  And when he proposed this idea, he'll have to talk for himself, but my understanding of it was that it was meant to tap new sources of funding, to channel into these areas in which an important conservation objective
[00:47:52.611 --> 00:47:54.031]  Can we turn our audio up to you?
[00:47:54.051 --> 00:47:54.851]  I was saying...
[00:48:22.893 --> 00:48:26.614]  In these clips, they're talking about banking principles.
[00:48:27.215 --> 00:48:27.455]  Yes.
[00:48:28.775 --> 00:48:29.595]  Comments on that?
[00:48:29.615 --> 00:48:38.278]  I think if I played the first clip for you, it would make it clearer to your audience.
[00:48:38.479 --> 00:48:40.039]  Okay, let's play clip number one.
[00:48:40.099 --> 00:48:42.280]  Michael Sweetman introduces the bank.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.821]  Yeah, there might be more in there for you.
[00:48:44.841 --> 00:48:45.601]  Okay, okay.
[00:48:46.061 --> 00:48:46.721]  Here's that clip.
[00:48:47.442 --> 00:48:51.203]  One of the people probably still coming in, but I think we need to get on with the agenda.
[00:48:53.868 --> 00:49:03.692]  I'm going to ask Morris Strong to open the session with some remarks, and then I'm going to ask him to introduce Mr. Rothschild, on my left.
[00:49:05.233 --> 00:49:17.618]  And following some remarks from Mr. Rothschild, briefly set the scene, and then we're going to open it to the floor and see if we can get some dialogue and get some responses and questions and some ideas from you.
[00:49:18.539 --> 00:49:19.259]  We'll take it from there.
[00:49:19.599 --> 00:49:20.700]  We've got three days.
[00:49:21.752 --> 00:49:25.934]  We've got various topics we're dealing with, as the program indicates.
[00:49:25.954 --> 00:49:30.796]  We've got some very good people on these panels, and they've come a long way, some of them, to be here.
[00:49:30.816 --> 00:49:35.338]  And I really appreciate that, because they clearly indicate an interest.
[00:49:38.149 --> 00:49:42.972]  And I think we're going to have a very interesting time over the next three days.
[00:49:43.912 --> 00:49:45.433]  But not just an interesting time.
[00:49:45.473 --> 00:49:48.135]  I hope we're going to have a very productive time over the next three days.
[00:49:48.795 --> 00:49:55.059]  And we're going to come out by tomorrow night, at any rate, with a resolution which we have to hand to the Resolutions Committee.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.905]  If we want a resolution about the World Conservation Bank in the Congress proceedings, and I hope, I trust that we do.
[00:50:00.925 --> 00:50:03.348]  So we've got to think about that as well.
[00:50:04.188 --> 00:50:15.661]  I suggest what we might do is to cover that at the end of these two sessions this afternoon, and maybe some of you may like to stay back and we could discuss how we proceed with that.
[00:50:17.054 --> 00:50:18.395]  Yes, George, I could hear you.
[00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:20.015]  We were finishing the clip you sent us.
[00:50:20.536 --> 00:50:21.216]  We're going to break.
[00:50:21.276 --> 00:50:22.296]  It was kind of long.
[00:50:22.336 --> 00:50:22.837]  I'm sorry.
[00:50:23.017 --> 00:50:23.537]  No, it's fine.
[00:50:23.617 --> 00:50:24.017]  It's good.
[00:50:24.097 --> 00:50:24.497]  It's great.
[00:50:25.278 --> 00:50:30.880]  When you introduce the bank, did you hear that we have to present this tomorrow?
[00:50:31.721 --> 00:50:35.702]  And so we've convened here with you to get your ideas towards this bank.
[00:50:36.142 --> 00:50:37.103]  It was a con job.
[00:50:38.338 --> 00:50:47.064]  Sure, I mean the UN always has its plan already set and then they just have a meeting with some of the elitist and then it's already been ratified.
[00:50:47.444 --> 00:50:47.804]  Stay there.
[00:50:47.824 --> 00:50:49.705]  We're going to come back and go over more of this.
[00:50:49.745 --> 00:50:51.746]  Got a bunch of clips coming up.
[00:50:52.047 --> 00:50:52.487]  Stay with us.
[00:50:59.648 --> 00:51:00.909]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:00.969 --> 00:51:06.293]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:06.553 --> 00:51:11.177]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:11.577 --> 00:51:11.957]  It's true.
[00:51:12.057 --> 00:51:16.641]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:51:17.141 --> 00:51:21.825]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:22.349 --> 00:51:29.292]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:29.472 --> 00:51:30.372]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:30.592 --> 00:51:36.955]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:51:37.275 --> 00:51:40.116]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:40.456 --> 00:51:42.357]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[00:51:43.637 --> 00:51:43.837]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:48.832 --> 00:51:49.033]  327-0365.
[00:51:51.496 --> 00:51:56.001]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:56.322 --> 00:51:58.705]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:52:00.009 --> 00:52:01.930]  Is your computer running slowly?

[00:54:05.033 --> 00:54:16.519]  If you want to see this all put in context, folks, get the film Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement on DVD, two and a half hours long, 40 minutes of extras, their whole master plan, their own statements.
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:19.461]  We have George Hunt, who
[00:54:21.021 --> 00:54:27.669]  Ended up in some of these meetings, high-level elite meetings by a twist of fate, and started investigating him, going to some of the sub-meetings over the years.
[00:54:28.109 --> 00:54:35.137]  He is with us today, and his website is TheBigBank.com, where you can get a documentary film he made along these same lines.
[00:54:36.581 --> 00:54:38.342]  Got a bunch of clips here, 19 clips.
[00:54:38.962 --> 00:54:41.023]  And I want to play Rothschild sums up the conference.
[00:54:41.043 --> 00:54:42.284]  I want to play some of the other clips.
[00:54:42.744 --> 00:54:44.785]  Rothschild International Communism introduced.
[00:54:44.825 --> 00:54:47.506]  I want to go over these, but first off is 17.
[00:54:47.546 --> 00:54:48.587]  You want to play 17.
[00:54:49.047 --> 00:54:49.887]  David Lang.
[00:54:49.908 --> 00:54:52.089]  Now tell people who David Lang is, George Hunt.
[00:54:53.289 --> 00:54:57.351]  Yes, he's a international banker from Montreal, Canada.
[00:54:57.571 --> 00:55:02.914]  He's a close friend of Michael Sweetman, the president of the World Conservation Bank.
[00:55:03.593 --> 00:55:04.694]  Okay, let's go ahead.
[00:55:05.474 --> 00:55:06.915]  Yeah, this is what he had to say about us.
[00:55:06.955 --> 00:55:07.436]  Here it is.
[00:55:08.336 --> 00:55:09.977]  This looks like David Lang from Montreal.
[00:55:11.278 --> 00:55:13.200]  He's always full of, he's always full of awkward questions.
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:19.684]  Until recently on the balance sheet, there were billions of dollars still listed as existing, which have now been written off.
[00:55:20.244 --> 00:55:25.548]  And so those surpluses have a bad habit of disappearing when the auditor finally gets his hands into the balance sheet.
[00:55:27.199 --> 00:55:31.081]  I suggest, therefore, that this be sold not through a democratic process.
[00:55:31.541 --> 00:55:39.085]  That would take too long and devour far too much of the funds to educate the cannon fodder, unfortunately, which populates the Earth.
[00:55:39.825 --> 00:55:56.273]  We have to take almost an elitist program that we can see beyond our swollen bellies and look to the future in time frames and in results which are not easily understood or which can be, with intellectual honesty, be reduced down to some kind of simplistic definition.
[00:55:58.956 --> 00:56:01.137]  That's an amazing statement, George Hunt.
[00:56:01.997 --> 00:56:03.658]  Yes, it's amazing, all right.
[00:56:04.098 --> 00:56:10.041]  It turned my gut and that's why I'm talking to you today, Alex.
[00:56:10.181 --> 00:56:11.722]  It just offended me so much.
[00:56:12.122 --> 00:56:24.167]  We're the cannon fodder that are unfortunately on the earth and they're talking about billions of dollars they already had in their banking system and talking about our property as if it was already theirs and how they were going to get it.
[00:56:24.928 --> 00:56:25.308]  Yes, sir.
[00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:45.562]  And they're eliminating population all the time through AIDS, through mercenary armies, through people like the Black Guard people that we just found out that they were tied in with the CIA.
[00:56:45.642 --> 00:56:47.363]  They're going murdering Iraqis.
[00:56:49.604 --> 00:56:51.725]  The American people have to do something about it.
[00:56:54.106 --> 00:56:55.967]  And we have to change our leadership.
[00:56:56.047 --> 00:57:12.611]  We have to get Cheney up to the Justice Bar and find out why Halliburton hired these Blackguard people that are killing citizens.
[00:57:14.591 --> 00:57:15.211]  It's all over.
[00:57:16.252 --> 00:57:18.092]  It's all through our society.
[00:57:18.892 --> 00:57:20.633]  We can't stop our government either.
[00:57:20.693 --> 00:57:21.933]  They just keep on killing.
[00:57:24.755 --> 00:57:31.677]  Well, we do have State Department memorandum 200, where in 73, secretly to the CIA, it was U.S.
[00:57:31.717 --> 00:57:39.020]  government policy to use IMF and World Bank loans to force third-world populations to reduce their population by at least 50%.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.761]  Yes, that kind of stuff.
[00:57:42.801 --> 00:57:45.542]  That goes on all the time, I guess.
[00:57:46.784 --> 00:57:47.205]  Amazing.
[00:57:47.245 --> 00:57:49.347]  There are so many other clips here to play of 19.
[00:57:51.069 --> 00:57:52.871]  What should we play next, George Hunt?
[00:57:52.971 --> 00:57:53.531]  Number 10.
[00:57:53.631 --> 00:57:54.993]  I think number 10 would be good.
[00:57:55.467 --> 00:57:57.308]  Okay, Rothschild elaborates.
[00:57:58.528 --> 00:57:59.109]  Well, you know what?
[00:57:59.129 --> 00:58:04.351]  We're going to go to break in a moment, come back in the next hour, and we'll play it when we come back after this 70-second break.
[00:58:05.032 --> 00:58:07.213]  And George Hunt will be with us for 30 minutes in the next hour.
[00:58:07.273 --> 00:58:08.173]  This is too important.
[00:58:08.773 --> 00:58:20.359]  We're going to continue playing these clips, and then specifically for George Hunt, specifically and only for him, on the subject of the phony environmental eugenics death plot movement.
[00:58:21.348 --> 00:58:24.190]  Calls to George Hunt will take four or five calls.
[00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:24.270]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:24.330]  800-259-9231.
[00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:28.412]  And we are simulcasting the radio show in Living Color at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:28.452 --> 00:58:29.833]  We'll be right back.

[00:59:52.355 --> 00:59:54.276]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.736 --> 00:59:57.498]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.016 --> 01:00:04.656]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.317 --> 01:00:06.357]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.098 --> 01:00:08.178]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:09.659]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.419 --> 01:00:11.320]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:15.622]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.162 --> 01:00:20.285]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.085 --> 01:00:24.387]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour when George Hunt leaves us,
[01:00:25.047 --> 01:00:26.848]  I'm going to get into the latest on health care.
[01:00:27.268 --> 01:00:32.269]  The flu scam has now been completely exposed by the EU itself as a total fraud.
[01:00:32.889 --> 01:00:35.490]  And they admit these vaccines were dangerous and it was wrong.
[01:00:36.690 --> 01:00:43.732]  We're also going to get into the latest on Bankstergate with Timmy Geithner and all of his criminal activity and your phone calls.
[01:00:43.852 --> 01:00:46.013]  But George Hunt inside Whistleblower.
[01:00:46.693 --> 01:00:56.556]  Who by a twist of fate wanted to get his son a job in conservation and literally one of the heads of the global government conference was sick.
[01:00:56.636 --> 01:01:03.199]  He called him and he said probably didn't thought it was somebody else from the conference calling and said yeah you can go and just walked right into this.
[01:01:03.979 --> 01:01:07.005]  And that's why it's important you go to government and non-governmental events.
[01:01:07.446 --> 01:01:09.109]  Weasel your way in, record it.
[01:01:09.129 --> 01:01:13.717]  I mean, I went to a Smart Growth Conference in 1998 in Austin.
[01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:16.482]  They had 4,000 people there, mainly from counties and cities.
[01:01:17.961 --> 01:01:18.942]  Okay, so this next clip
[01:01:41.196 --> 01:01:45.479]  Is Rothschild elaborates, then we'll go through more of these clips and get George Hunt's take on it.
[01:01:45.859 --> 01:01:48.080]  Okay, Rothschild elaborates, we'll play this.
[01:01:48.901 --> 01:01:56.125]  To overcome the chilling, doom-laden prognostications of Dr. Irving Mintzer's greenhouse effect.
[01:01:57.196 --> 01:02:14.629]  Perhaps it could be possible to utilize CO2, carbon dioxide, one of its main causes, to manufacture dry ice, to maintain the polar caps and the actual temperature of the ice there, and maintain their present temperature.
[01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:20.513]  Innovative and modern technology, world-waste material,
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:35.325]  Collected and perhaps burnt in volcanic areas, or buried so deep in the earth, in the wilderness desert areas of the mid-Sahara, where nobody goes, or in the empty quarter in Arabia, or the Gobi Desert.
[01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:47.149]  But all these ideas and visions, some far-fetched, and above all, the continuation of this Congress, needs money.
[01:02:49.193 --> 01:02:52.515]  So they get to take over and ship dry ice.
[01:02:52.595 --> 01:02:53.736]  Imagine the money they'd make.
[01:02:53.856 --> 01:02:57.939]  Or they will control globally toxic waste being shipped to the Sahara.
[01:02:58.339 --> 01:03:00.080]  So they want to control waste management.
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:01.661]  They want to control private property.
[01:03:02.501 --> 01:03:11.747]  And they want to scare the public with far-fetched programs into accepting that the earth must be dying from carbon dioxide because look at all the money we're spending on it.
[01:03:12.007 --> 01:03:12.868]  It must be real.
[01:03:13.228 --> 01:03:17.331]  Is that an accurate breakdown of what he was really saying there, George Hunt?
[01:03:17.901 --> 01:03:37.933]  Yes, they're creating a demand for dry ice machines, shall we say, through their rhetoric, so that the people will become fearful of Mother Earth crumbling, and they'll give in, then, to all of these monstrous projects that will cost trillions of dollars.
[01:03:38.594 --> 01:03:43.497]  And the elite will be in the front end of these projects, in the
[01:03:45.199 --> 01:03:53.202]  Maybe as the first investors, and it will grow into a huge monster, and then it'll collapse.
[01:03:54.322 --> 01:04:01.985]  And the elite will have pulled themselves out of this project before it collapses.
[01:04:02.525 --> 01:04:10.608]  So you're going to see a lot of these ideas coming along that will change the climate.
[01:04:14.142 --> 01:04:15.962]  That was another point, and we're going to go to break.
[01:04:16.022 --> 01:04:18.143]  Long segment coming up and play clip after clip.
[01:04:18.503 --> 01:04:20.404]  But clearly it's now declassified.
[01:04:20.424 --> 01:04:21.304]  They have weather weapons.
[01:04:21.344 --> 01:04:23.205]  They can create, control hurricanes.
[01:04:23.665 --> 01:04:24.985]  That's all declassified.
[01:04:25.045 --> 01:04:33.908]  We know the White House science czar, John P. Holdren, who's called for global extermination, drugging the water to sterilize us in his own book, Ecoscience.
[01:04:34.668 --> 01:04:40.471]  We know that they're already manipulating the weather to create calamities to scare people into submission.
[01:04:40.771 --> 01:04:41.751]  George Hunt, stay there.
[01:04:41.771 --> 01:04:46.253]  I'm going to come back and get your take on that on the other side of this quick break.
[01:04:46.614 --> 01:04:53.617]  And then we're going to play clip after clip and get quick comments from you about what Rothschild, Strong, and others are saying.
[01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:56.978]  They talk about international communism being introduced.
[01:04:57.319 --> 01:04:58.999]  This is incredible info.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:03.462]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:03.742 --> 01:05:04.322]  Number one.
[01:05:04.642 --> 01:05:08.644]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:08.924 --> 01:05:13.485]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:14.286]  It's true.
[01:05:14.566 --> 01:05:19.108]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.248 --> 01:05:23.551]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:23.831 --> 01:05:28.314]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.555 --> 01:05:30.936]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:31.317 --> 01:05:34.659]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:39.702]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:39.922 --> 01:05:44.685]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:44.985 --> 01:05:49.007]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:49.148 --> 01:05:50.708]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.929 --> 01:05:55.551]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:05:59.636 --> 01:06:02.258]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:02.658 --> 01:06:07.622]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:07.982 --> 01:06:09.724]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:10.024 --> 01:06:14.848]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:15.028 --> 01:06:15.989]  How much do you want?
[01:06:16.209 --> 01:06:16.969]  When do you want it?
[01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:18.931]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:19.231 --> 01:06:20.052]  When will you need it?
[01:06:20.292 --> 01:06:22.373]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:22.493 --> 01:06:23.614]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:23.835 --> 01:06:25.176]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:25.376 --> 01:06:25.736]  If there's a
[01:06:25.776 --> 01:06:27.738]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:06:27.898 --> 01:06:30.420]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:30.621 --> 01:06:33.824]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:34.204 --> 01:06:37.707]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:39.028]  How much will you need?
[01:06:39.269 --> 01:06:39.869]  We don't know.
[01:06:40.149 --> 01:06:41.070]  How much do you want?
[01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:41.991]  All you can get.
[01:06:42.011 --> 01:06:42.872]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:43.272 --> 01:06:43.492]  I think.
[01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:05.479]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:07:05.599 --> 01:07:06.840]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:07.561]  It's very real.
[01:07:07.681 --> 01:07:11.463]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:07:11.583 --> 01:07:16.006]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:07:34.983 --> 01:07:42.132]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[01:07:49.274 --> 01:07:49.494]  Big Brother.
[01:08:05.752 --> 01:08:06.793]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:07.513 --> 01:08:08.614]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:09.275 --> 01:08:10.095]  You want answers?
[01:08:10.856 --> 01:08:11.836]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.417 --> 01:08:15.999]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:20.703]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.603 --> 01:08:29.288]  Eight minutes into hour number three, George Hunt was just talking about how they declassified weather manipulation, weather control systems.
[01:08:30.362 --> 01:08:35.623]  And how they can clearly use this to create calamities and then scare the population into submission.
[01:08:36.023 --> 01:08:38.004]  That's been one of my biggest concerns.
[01:08:38.844 --> 01:08:41.125]  Going back to George Hunt, George, your take on that?
[01:08:42.165 --> 01:08:50.587]  Well, um, the, um, the concern that I have is the E-bomb.
[01:08:51.567 --> 01:08:56.068]  The, uh, so-called, uh, surge bomb?
[01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:58.429]  Electromagnetic pulse weapon.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:00.400]  Yes, you got it.
[01:09:01.381 --> 01:09:19.948]  That thing would be easy for any little state like North Korea or Iran or Israel to send a rocket bearing an atomic bomb up in the sky about 300 miles, exploding it and wiping out all of the electricity in line of sight of that explosion.
[01:09:20.329 --> 01:09:21.449]  That's the thing that bothers me.
[01:09:21.489 --> 01:09:23.390]  You think the globalists would go that far?
[01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:24.410]  Oh yes.
[01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:28.572]  David Rockefeller has stated, and I checked it on the
[01:09:29.238 --> 01:09:37.362]  On the internet last night, that the world order will not be established until a terrible catastrophe occurs.
[01:09:37.862 --> 01:09:39.483]  Yeah, they all say that continually.
[01:09:39.503 --> 01:09:43.785]  He actually said that in the Council on Foreign Relations publication, Foreign Affairs.
[01:09:44.285 --> 01:09:46.206]  That's part of their fear doctrine, huh?
[01:09:47.227 --> 01:09:47.487]  Maybe.
[01:09:48.107 --> 01:09:50.468]  Do you want to continue along that line or go to some more clips?
[01:09:51.029 --> 01:09:53.110]  Well, I'd like to follow the line.
[01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:54.110]  Let's go to some clips.
[01:09:54.150 --> 01:09:57.312]  Let's have Maury Strong, number 7.
[01:09:59.159 --> 01:10:02.400]  Okay, Maury Strong announces Rothschild.
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:04.641]  Then I want to get to Rothschild talking about communism.
[01:10:05.102 --> 01:10:06.362]  Okay, here's Maury Strong.
[01:10:08.303 --> 01:10:09.363]  Let's play seven first.
[01:10:09.403 --> 01:10:10.044]  Let's go through these.
[01:10:10.064 --> 01:10:10.524]  Here's seven.
[01:10:11.286 --> 01:10:13.006]  There is no better person.
[01:10:13.486 --> 01:10:30.030]  He epitomizes in his own life that positive synthesis between environment conservation on the one hand and economics on the other and I'm just delighted to have this opportunity of introducing to you Edmund de Rothschild.
[01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:34.511]  Now I want to go ahead now and go to clip number
[01:10:36.099 --> 01:10:40.383]  13.
[01:10:36.299 --> 01:10:40.383]  I want to play the World Collective again, then some new clips, 14 and others.
[01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:41.764]  Here's 13 with Rothschild.
[01:10:42.805 --> 01:11:01.040]  By thinking forward as to how to reach out to the public at large, to every corporate entity throughout the world, to put aside, hopefully tax-free, a part of their profits to fund our ecological and environmental protection.
[01:11:02.631 --> 01:11:05.033]  So, tax-free paid to his bank.
[01:11:05.133 --> 01:11:06.274]  I have Reuters right here.
[01:11:06.294 --> 01:11:09.157]  20-something years later, here it is happening.
[01:11:10.018 --> 01:11:12.780]  Giving them money, and then they're tax-free to use it.
[01:11:13.621 --> 01:11:14.141]  That's it.
[01:11:14.542 --> 01:11:22.909]  I didn't know that occurred, but I saw the banks tumbling down, and as the banks tumble, they're tumbling to the house of Rothschild.
[01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:28.014]  Now, on the last clip you played, or the one before that,
[01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:39.175]  Did you hear Maury Strong announce him as the positive synthesis between conservation on one side and growth and development on the other?
[01:11:40.136 --> 01:11:48.219]  He is the result of, he controls, in other words, the conservation movement and the economic movement.
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:50.080]  Rothschild's got it all.
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.901]  Well, I've seen all the big Rothschilds out of England.
[01:11:54.557 --> 01:11:59.661]  The two heads of it, openly writing articles, giving speeches, calling for global governance.
[01:11:59.681 --> 01:12:02.623]  We'll play a clip from Bloomberg here in Copenhagen coming up.
[01:12:03.364 --> 01:12:06.406]  Let's go ahead now and go to clip number 14.
[01:12:06.506 --> 01:12:10.629]  Rothschild, Lord Rothschild, international communism introduced.
[01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:11.350]  Here's that clip.
[01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:20.277]  Ladies and gentlemen, every country has its own problems, its indigenous peoples and its wildlife.
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:27.664]  This International Conservation Bank must know no frontiers, no boundaries.
[01:12:28.565 --> 01:12:38.471]  Its funds must be used constructively and not, and not to be challenged into greedy hands or weapons of destruction.
[01:12:40.252 --> 01:12:48.117]  So here are these people, always financing revolutions and wars and weapons systems, and you call that communism introduced.
[01:12:48.157 --> 01:12:48.858]  Why do you say that?
[01:12:49.721 --> 01:13:00.108]  Yes, in other words, the currency will be used as a communal device, because there will be one world currency.
[01:13:01.248 --> 01:13:18.980]  And he's saying, too, as I recall in his speech, that each country also has its own indigenous people, and they'll be allowed to have soft currencies, but the currencies will be intermingled
[01:13:19.905 --> 01:13:25.007]  Yeah, you're going to have a global currency over the regionals, which they're now setting up.
[01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:29.568]  It's amazing, 23 years later, to see all of this actually unfolding.
[01:13:30.349 --> 01:13:40.752]  And also, Ban Ki-moon, a month and a half ago in the New York Times, Secretary General of the UN, he said all nations will be forced to pay into the UN to fund this.
[01:13:42.113 --> 01:13:44.333]  Let's play clip number 15.
[01:13:44.473 --> 01:13:45.654]  Rothschild brags.
[01:13:45.694 --> 01:13:46.054]  Here it is.
[01:13:50.606 --> 01:14:03.171]  If there are any Japanese in the audience, I would apologize for them, but I've had very great experience in Japan since my family has had connections with them since 1865 after Perry opened them up in 1863.
[01:14:09.670 --> 01:14:10.870]  Let's play another clip.
[01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:14.811]  Let's have Michael Sweetman, James Baker quote.
[01:14:15.131 --> 01:14:16.311]  Clip number 16.
[01:14:16.371 --> 01:14:18.912]  Here's Michael Sweetman, James Baker quote.
[01:14:19.252 --> 01:14:19.752]  Here it is.
[01:14:20.132 --> 01:14:22.112]  At his keynote address to this Congress, U.S.
[01:14:22.153 --> 01:14:30.014]  Treasury Secretary James A. Baker pointed to the, I quote, the underlying reality that sound conservation is good economics.
[01:14:31.034 --> 01:14:34.895]  And further, conservation should not be the enemy of prosperity.
[01:14:35.235 --> 01:14:37.816]  It should instead sustain and enrich our prosperity.
[01:14:39.096 --> 01:14:39.476]  Unquote.
[01:14:41.892 --> 01:14:45.253]  How do you decipher that, decode that, George Hunt?
[01:14:46.254 --> 01:14:48.695]  Well, I couldn't hear him very well on that.
[01:14:50.556 --> 01:14:57.599]  I have to beg... Yeah, I think that's part of the problem today is you're having trouble hearing.
[01:14:57.879 --> 01:15:00.820]  That was the James Baker quote by Michael Sweetman.
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:12.865]  Yes, I set that up for you to play because James Baker made a remark that caused the conservationists to tremble at the beginning of the meeting.
[01:15:13.305 --> 01:15:19.528]  He gave the keynote address and he said that conservation required growth and development.
[01:15:20.628 --> 01:15:22.789]  And the conservationists said, what?
[01:15:22.849 --> 01:15:24.510]  You could hear the murmur in the audience.
[01:15:24.972 --> 01:15:36.479]  Well, what that means is that Rothschild, in order to be the positive synthesis of growth and development and economics, has to have a dynamic going.
[01:15:36.959 --> 01:15:47.405]  It has to be a forceful opposition in order for his group to go in and pick up the pieces and take over control.
[01:15:48.045 --> 01:15:52.488]  So, he's encouraging this war between conservation and development.
[01:15:54.031 --> 01:15:58.214]  And he is the synthesis of all the stuff that'll come out of the war.
[01:15:58.934 --> 01:16:09.562]  Now for those that missed it, I want to play banker David Lang talking about their elitist program and how to deal with the cannon fodder one more time and then two final clips we haven't played yet.
[01:16:09.622 --> 01:16:10.302]  Play clip 17.
[01:16:11.323 --> 01:16:12.244]  It's so chilling.
[01:16:12.584 --> 01:16:13.204]  Here is clip 17.
[01:16:14.085 --> 01:16:15.226]  David Lang from Montreal.
[01:16:16.546 --> 01:16:18.448]  He's always full of, he's always full of awkward questions.
[01:16:19.463 --> 01:16:30.808]  Until recently, on the balance sheet, there were billions of dollars still listed as existing, which have now been written off, and so those surpluses have a bad habit of disappearing when the auditor finally gets his hands into the balance sheet.
[01:16:32.449 --> 01:16:36.311]  I suggest, therefore, that this be sold not through a democratic process.
[01:16:36.791 --> 01:16:44.335]  That would take too long and devour far too much of the funds to educate the cannon fodder, unfortunately, which populates the Earth.
[01:16:45.075 --> 01:16:46.876]  We have to take almost an elitist program
[01:16:47.682 --> 01:17:01.533]  That we can see beyond our swollen bellies and look to the future in time frames and in results which are not easily understood or which can be, with intellectual honesty, be reduced down to some kind of simplistic definition.
[01:17:03.715 --> 01:17:04.796]  Okay, George Hunt.
[01:17:05.516 --> 01:17:11.221]  George, I want to ask you about this Maharaja clip where he questions Michael Sweetman's words.
[01:17:11.621 --> 01:17:14.444]  We're going to play this clip and then get you to comment on that, okay?
[01:17:16.266 --> 01:17:16.866]  All right, good.
[01:17:16.946 --> 01:17:20.307]  Here's the Maharaja questions Michael Sweetman's words.
[01:17:20.587 --> 01:17:21.047]  Here it is.
[01:17:21.728 --> 01:17:22.608]  I'll be very brief.
[01:17:22.628 --> 01:17:30.790]  I've been listening patiently to Michael Sweetman's paper and the discussion so far.
[01:17:33.791 --> 01:17:45.915]  I'm confused, particularly since I am the president of the World Wildlife Fund India, an NGO, of the need of another
[01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.870]  Helping hand.
[01:17:50.511 --> 01:18:09.795]  But since this baby has been accidentally conceived by Michael Sweatman, and I presume that he's either a very foolish man or a very clever man.
[01:18:10.435 --> 01:18:11.755]  I think he's a very clever man.
[01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:15.396]  Because the paper does not give any details.
[01:18:15.496 --> 01:18:16.336]  It's very general.
[01:18:18.522 --> 01:18:32.688]  Well, so Maharaja's pointing out this gives a blank check of power to this World Conference Congress instead of the World Wildlife Fund set up by the Nazi Prince Bernhard to carry out extermination.
[01:18:32.728 --> 01:18:35.189]  What's going on in that clip with the Maharaja?
[01:18:35.849 --> 01:18:40.251]  Well, the Maharaja saw the light.
[01:18:40.911 --> 01:18:45.733]  He saw that either it was a very foolish plan
[01:18:46.314 --> 01:18:51.278]  That Michael Sweetman was introducing, you know, to save the world's conservation.
[01:18:52.139 --> 01:18:53.961]  Or it was a clever plan.
[01:18:55.182 --> 01:19:00.887]  And he didn't identify why it was clever, but he said, but I believe it's a clever plan.
[01:19:02.308 --> 01:19:10.155]  It's a clever plan because it seems to appear that they are saving conservation.
[01:19:11.175 --> 01:19:13.938]  And I think that's what the Maharaj saw.
[01:19:14.881 --> 01:19:20.204]  They were going to get money out of it instead of nice pretty new trees.
[01:19:21.225 --> 01:19:22.206]  It's a clever plan.
[01:19:22.646 --> 01:19:27.029]  And everyone laughs because they understand that of course it's a joke.
[01:19:27.089 --> 01:19:31.412]  That's why they're there is to get their hands on property and control the world population.
[01:19:32.012 --> 01:19:33.233]  So he's stating the obvious.
[01:19:35.054 --> 01:19:40.818]  I asked him as an official host, when is this bank going to come to pass
[01:19:41.701 --> 01:19:53.807]  And what I got out of them was there will be a collapse in 2012 of the world currency and that the World Conservation Bank will come in to save the world.
[01:19:53.827 --> 01:19:54.387]  So stay there!
[01:19:54.447 --> 01:19:56.208]  This is incredible bombshell info.
[01:19:56.228 --> 01:19:56.828]  Stay with us.
[01:19:57.729 --> 01:19:58.189]  Amazing.
[01:19:59.537 --> 01:20:02.718]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:20:03.078 --> 01:20:04.919]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:20:05.379 --> 01:20:05.779]  Don't!
[01:20:06.239 --> 01:20:09.260]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:20:09.681 --> 01:20:18.444]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[01:20:18.764 --> 01:20:22.445]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:20:22.845 --> 01:20:25.567]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:33.011]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:20:33.351 --> 01:20:34.352]  Herb K was right.
[01:20:34.532 --> 01:20:37.614]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:20:37.734 --> 01:20:38.735]  What have you got to lose?
[01:20:39.075 --> 01:20:42.217]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:20:42.777 --> 01:20:45.859]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now!
[01:20:46.099 --> 01:20:46.459]  Call 888-352-7726.
[01:20:46.719 --> 01:20:47.260]  That's 888-352-7726.
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:47.320]  888-352-7726.
[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:50.542]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:20:51.162 --> 01:20:53.283]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:20:53.303 --> 01:20:55.585]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:21:10.214 --> 01:21:12.855]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:12.875 --> 01:21:19.097]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:19.277 --> 01:21:24.799]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:24.819 --> 01:21:34.442]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:34.562 --> 01:21:36.684]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:36.904 --> 01:21:38.245]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:38.505 --> 01:21:40.787]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:40.967 --> 01:21:42.809]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:43.089 --> 01:21:47.893]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:48.233 --> 01:21:53.017]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:21:53.257 --> 01:21:57.361]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:59.335 --> 01:22:05.217]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[01:22:05.657 --> 01:22:10.318]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[01:22:10.598 --> 01:22:14.399]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[01:22:14.679 --> 01:22:15.860]  Let's put this another way.
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:21.201]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[01:22:21.381 --> 01:22:24.002]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[01:22:24.282 --> 01:22:26.642]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[01:22:26.923 --> 01:22:28.303]  You can possess it in your hand.
[01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:29.603]  You can take it with you.
[01:22:29.903 --> 01:22:30.984]  Gold is real money.
[01:22:31.384 --> 01:22:32.484]  Gold is honest money.
[01:22:32.745 --> 01:22:34.985]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.
[01:22:35.466 --> 01:22:42.528]  To find out how you can protect your savings and roll over your IRA funds into precious metal accounts, call me at 800-686-2237, extension 134.

[01:22:43.489 --> 01:22:44.409]  800-686-2237, extension 134.
[01:22:59.369 --> 01:23:07.774]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[01:23:08.074 --> 01:23:13.177]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[01:23:13.217 --> 01:23:13.758]  and Canada.
[01:23:14.078 --> 01:23:20.602]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[01:23:21.167 --> 01:23:24.430]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[01:23:24.571 --> 01:23:26.813]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:54.035]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[01:23:54.055 --> 01:23:54.996]  Is it getting better?
[01:24:15.863 --> 01:24:17.724]  Or do you feel the same?
[01:24:21.206 --> 01:24:22.787]  Will it make it easier on you?
[01:24:22.807 --> 01:24:28.470]  Alright, I'm going to go ahead and just keep George Hutchell for the after so I can go to Mike Herman, Terry Benn, and a couple others.
[01:24:30.352 --> 01:24:32.613]  But he just dropped another big bombshell.
[01:24:32.853 --> 01:24:36.216]  Studying the UN zone documents, studying the IMF World Bank.
[01:24:36.856 --> 01:24:44.241]  The banks want to get everybody in debt, all the nations, all the sub-states within the nations bankrupted to then make you dependent on them.
[01:24:44.261 --> 01:24:51.366]  And then under environmental rules, grab and snatch property and raise the taxes so you go bankrupt.
[01:24:51.726 --> 01:24:56.610]  Then they bring in a global regime, global rationing openly being announced.
[01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:57.691]  This is their plan.
[01:24:58.351 --> 01:24:59.993]  They're brainwashing your kids in school.
[01:25:00.113 --> 01:25:01.255]  They're really trying it.
[01:25:01.615 --> 01:25:03.618]  Copenhagen was a big blow against them.
[01:25:03.938 --> 01:25:06.461]  The fact that their scientists know it's a fraud.
[01:25:06.481 --> 01:25:07.683]  Ben Santer at the U.N.
[01:25:08.263 --> 01:25:10.506]  admitting that it's all, you know, made up.
[01:25:10.526 --> 01:25:13.349]  That they basically cut these sections out of the U.N.
[01:25:13.390 --> 01:25:17.374]  report where their own scientists said man wasn't causing global warming.
[01:25:18.035 --> 01:25:22.097]  Or they're covering up the fact for the last nine years the earth has been radically cooling.
[01:25:22.758 --> 01:25:23.398]  All of this.
[01:25:24.498 --> 01:25:29.681]  And then he's saying he's there talking to Rockefeller, talking to others.
[01:25:30.241 --> 01:25:31.982]  Specifically tell that story.
[01:25:32.483 --> 01:25:35.084]  And they're saying they're going to bankrupt the world in 2012.
[01:25:35.144 --> 01:25:36.245]  This is in 1987.
[01:25:36.645 --> 01:25:41.587]  Everything George talked about, he put this out 15 years ago or more, has now come true.
[01:25:42.008 --> 01:25:43.689]  Really proving what he's saying.
[01:25:44.329 --> 01:25:46.370]  But specifically, take your time.
[01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:47.670]  Who said this again?
[01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:48.510]  Was it Rockefeller?
[01:25:48.570 --> 01:25:49.651]  I'm going from memory.
[01:25:49.991 --> 01:25:54.772]  At this conference, they said how they're going to do it and make the World Conservation Bank take over.
[01:25:55.872 --> 01:25:56.352]  Okay.
[01:25:57.072 --> 01:26:04.994]  It was... You remember, I was there for three days asking lots of questions, okay?
[01:26:05.494 --> 01:26:15.196]  So, the questions evolved to, number one, the question I had was, how is this bank going to be funded?
[01:26:16.374 --> 01:26:45.907]  I learned through the guests there, maybe I went to McNeil of the United Nations, I don't know where, but I found out that the plan is, and this is hearsay, that the plan is that the bank is going to bankrupt in 2012, and that the elite that put money into the bank
[01:26:46.584 --> 01:27:09.539]  When it bankrupts, those elite people will go into the bank, take it over, and take over every mortgage, everything, all the accounts, all the credit cards, everything that people have, and the bank will then officially be in Rothschild's hands, where before it was surreptitiously in Rothschild's hands.
[01:27:09.991 --> 01:27:10.872]  Well, this is incredible.
[01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:19.597]  Let me stop you and I want you to elaborate, George Hunt, because now we see a small group of central banks bankrupting other banks by design to consolidate.
[01:27:19.637 --> 01:27:20.638]  That's in their own documents.
[01:27:20.658 --> 01:27:31.625]  We see the IMF and World Bank to be holding companies for the global tax money through what they did agree to at Copenhagen, and that's actually what they're now setting up.
[01:27:31.685 --> 01:27:36.408]  They're openly setting up what participants told you they were going to set up.
[01:27:36.548 --> 01:27:38.209]  Are they getting this position for 2012?
[01:27:40.031 --> 01:27:43.353]  That's where they're headed from my last information, Alex.
[01:27:45.215 --> 01:27:47.156]  They don't slow down on their plans.
[01:27:47.556 --> 01:27:48.497]  They don't defer them.
[01:27:49.117 --> 01:27:53.540]  They just eliminate the problem for their plans to go through.
[01:27:53.941 --> 01:27:55.402]  People like me, of course.
[01:27:56.983 --> 01:28:04.828]  So, yeah, I would say there's going to be a major currency splash in 2012.
[01:28:07.433 --> 01:28:09.014]  Or leading up to 2000.
[01:28:09.674 --> 01:28:10.554]  Or leading up to 2012.
[01:28:10.915 --> 01:28:12.255]  I mean, this is already happening.
[01:28:13.496 --> 01:28:19.538]  The globe is imploding by an engineered depression, and everything is falling to the house of Rothschild and Rockefeller.
[01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:24.220]  And every time they bust an oligarch in Russia, it turns out it was really owned by the Rothschilds.
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:25.180]  That's mainstream news.
[01:28:25.881 --> 01:28:26.761]  Well, yeah.
[01:28:26.801 --> 01:28:28.642]  Look at the news about Warren Buffett.
[01:28:29.602 --> 01:28:34.044]  He's accusing the Rothschild family of controlling the world gold market.
[01:28:34.682 --> 01:28:39.984]  He's probably right, because the Rothschilds set the price of gold twice a day in London.
[01:28:40.884 --> 01:28:41.425]  For the world.
[01:28:43.525 --> 01:28:45.346]  Unbelievable information.
[01:28:45.366 --> 01:28:52.549]  And again, when did you first start going public, releasing the videos of the conferences, releasing the audio, and saying all of this?
[01:28:52.609 --> 01:28:54.589]  Wasn't it like 20 years ago?
[01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.610]  Yes.
[01:28:56.210 --> 01:29:01.592]  It was in 1988 that a preacher named Charles Allendale
[01:29:02.062 --> 01:29:12.969]  Who had a radio station in Texas, was accused of having me on.
[01:29:14.150 --> 01:29:19.393]  And they said, look, if you have that guy George Hunt on again, you're going to lose your job.
[01:29:19.634 --> 01:29:23.296]  Well, he had me on again the next week because this is earth shattering news.
[01:29:23.951 --> 01:29:28.875]  Well, the station was immediately bought out, and Alan Dale lost his job.
[01:29:29.115 --> 01:29:30.676]  And that's the issue.
[01:29:30.696 --> 01:29:34.419]  20 years ago, 22 years ago, they could stop stuff.
[01:29:34.859 --> 01:29:35.640]  Now they can't.
[01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:37.041]  It's out in the open.
[01:29:37.121 --> 01:29:37.601]  Stay there.
[01:29:37.661 --> 01:29:39.663]  George Hunt, incredible information.
[01:29:40.043 --> 01:29:43.846]  The website is the, with a the in the front, bigbank.com.
[01:29:44.206 --> 01:29:47.829]  Our websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[01:29:48.069 --> 01:29:48.910]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.131 --> 01:29:51.071]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.532 --> 01:29:53.033]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.028 --> 01:29:56.790]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.191 --> 01:30:03.434]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:03.754 --> 01:30:04.374]  Number one.
[01:30:04.654 --> 01:30:07.816]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:08.076 --> 01:30:08.657]  Number two.
[01:30:08.937 --> 01:30:13.520]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:14.300]  It's true.
[01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:19.123]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:19.443 --> 01:30:19.984]  Number 3.
[01:30:20.264 --> 01:30:23.546]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:23.847 --> 01:30:27.589]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:28.310]  Number 4.
[01:30:28.570 --> 01:30:30.932]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:31.332 --> 01:30:34.715]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:35.015 --> 01:30:35.215]  Number 5.
[01:30:35.796 --> 01:30:39.719]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:39.939 --> 01:30:44.703]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:44.983 --> 01:30:49.007]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:49.147 --> 01:30:50.729]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.949 --> 01:30:53.031]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:30:53.191 --> 01:30:55.534]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:00.814 --> 01:31:04.455]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:04.775 --> 01:31:12.897]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:31:13.638 --> 01:31:17.679]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:31:18.259 --> 01:31:29.082]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:31:29.722 --> 01:31:38.724]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:39.224 --> 01:31:44.265]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:51.847]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:52.147 --> 01:31:54.888]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:00.054 --> 01:32:03.698]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:32:03.718 --> 01:32:07.082]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:32:07.322 --> 01:32:12.108]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:32:12.128 --> 01:32:18.335]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:32:18.515 --> 01:32:20.758]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:32:21.278 --> 01:32:22.699]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:32:22.739 --> 01:32:23.420]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.561]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:32:40.191 --> 01:32:42.012]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:32:42.312 --> 01:32:47.155]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:32:47.475 --> 01:32:56.820]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:59.713 --> 01:33:10.749]  Way up north to Alaska Way up north to Alaska North to Alaska Go north for Russia's home North to Alaska Go north for Russia's home
[01:33:17.208 --> 01:33:24.633]  Okay, final segment with George Hunt, and then I'm going to break down all the huge BankerGate news, what's happening with healthcare.
[01:33:24.973 --> 01:33:25.934]  It can be stopped.
[01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:28.275]  It looks like it's in conference right now.
[01:33:28.936 --> 01:33:31.378]  The flu fraud being fully exposed.
[01:33:31.398 --> 01:33:33.819]  But I want to go to calls, Mike Herman, Terry Benn.
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:46.488]  We're only taking calls specifically for George Hunt, for your questions on this important issue of a global elite organizing the planet under the fraud of fake environmentalism to take your basic rights, your liberty, your property.
[01:33:47.068 --> 01:33:59.383]  And we played that clip yesterday of Australia where they're just grabbing all the farmer's land, literally in some areas all of it, and just saying it's off limits for carbon credits, you can't run cattle or sheep on your own land anymore.
[01:34:00.024 --> 01:34:04.669]  This is really happening, and it's happening here, and we've got to stop these people.
[01:34:05.519 --> 01:34:16.827]  When we got the SPP documents a few years ago from the North American Union meetings, it was the corporate leaders there running the government meetings with the bureaucracy saying, we're going to tax and pay ourselves the carbon tax.
[01:34:17.307 --> 01:34:18.908]  The good news is, this is in trouble.
[01:34:20.129 --> 01:34:23.791]  George Hunt, are you not excited to see Copenhagen exposed?
[01:34:24.152 --> 01:34:28.255]  You were talking about this 22 years ago and people, some of them were laughing at you now.
[01:34:28.335 --> 01:34:29.595]  It's all out in the open.
[01:34:30.136 --> 01:34:31.597]  Is that exciting you, George Hunt?
[01:34:32.348 --> 01:34:34.089]  Oh, it's exciting me so much.
[01:34:34.549 --> 01:34:36.290]  My name is George Washington Hunt.
[01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:46.534]  I was born on Columbus Day, and I think that I have a mission to defeat these people, to help defeat these people.
[01:34:48.095 --> 01:34:56.098]  When I was on the Jesse Ventura Show, I said to the camera, I think they're going to win it.
[01:34:56.118 --> 01:34:58.299]  And the reason was that they're smarter than us.
[01:34:58.837 --> 01:35:09.530]  But if you take our combined intelligence, like I'm hearing coming out of you and you're hearing coming out of me, we can whip these guys so we can get Americans to cooperate.
[01:35:10.752 --> 01:35:15.298]  Americans and others around the world just have to face their own documents, their own statements.
[01:35:15.658 --> 01:35:17.040]  I mean, in fact, I'll grab it.
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:17.621]  It's over here.
[01:35:20.228 --> 01:35:23.410]  I talk about this book every week on air, Ecoscience.
[01:35:23.490 --> 01:35:27.572]  I've scanned through the whole 1,100 pages, or whatever it is.
[01:35:27.592 --> 01:35:28.512]  Let me see how long it is.
[01:35:29.052 --> 01:35:30.473]  Yeah, the 1,100 pages.
[01:35:30.973 --> 01:35:37.496]  I've scanned through this, and it openly says, poison the water supply, sterilize us, cut off our resources, bankrupt us.
[01:35:37.796 --> 01:35:39.337]  This is the White House science czar.
[01:35:39.417 --> 01:35:41.538]  John P. Holdren wrote Ecoscience.
[01:35:41.558 --> 01:35:49.342]  I mean, there are literally thousands of white papers, books, publications, where they openly state what they're openly doing, and now this guy gives
[01:35:49.682 --> 01:35:55.507]  Press conferences, the White House Science Czar saying they've got a secret program already manipulating the weather.
[01:35:56.648 --> 01:35:57.228]  That's right.
[01:35:57.429 --> 01:36:17.766]  They've already, they dreamed up these plans as far as hundreds of years ago and the contemporary plans that we see where the banks are going down and so on is part of their plan that was conceived as far as I could see a hundred years ago.
[01:36:18.365 --> 01:36:27.091]  Okay, I want to go to calls, but first I want to play a few global governance clips for people that may have missed the last few of them, that have occurred in the last two months.
[01:36:27.492 --> 01:36:36.098]  Herman Van Rompuy, the head of the EU, openly calling for global governance, saying that the UN global carbon tax is the heart of world government.
[01:36:36.698 --> 01:36:37.659]  It's past the point of torture.
[01:36:51.796 --> 01:36:53.156]  In case you missed it,
[01:37:20.370 --> 01:37:22.372]  It's past the point of talking.
[01:37:22.932 --> 01:37:29.256]  We know historically that the global governance agenda to these issues is very hard to try.
[01:37:30.477 --> 01:37:33.760]  So there he is saying the time for talk is over.
[01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:35.521]  That means you don't get any input.
[01:37:35.821 --> 01:37:36.522]  We're doing this.
[01:37:36.562 --> 01:37:37.803]  Well, we did get input.
[01:37:38.083 --> 01:37:39.484]  We did expose their fraud.
[01:37:39.724 --> 01:37:40.404]  They're in trouble.
[01:37:40.544 --> 01:37:41.045]  George Hunt.
[01:37:42.145 --> 01:37:49.810]  This whole global carbon tax thing that's going on, I have to admit that I don't really understand it.
[01:37:50.210 --> 01:38:01.598]  But I do know that the House of Rothschild pushed it through the chairman of the House of Rothschild at a meeting of the London banks.
[01:38:02.078 --> 01:38:07.482]  That happened about six months ago when I picked up on that clip.
[01:38:07.902 --> 01:38:10.784]  This carbon tax, what do you know about it, Alex?
[01:38:12.193 --> 01:38:18.835]  Well, it's fully meant to tax and control all human activity to be selectively enforced, just like the health care plan.
[01:38:19.515 --> 01:38:22.856]  Some unions don't have to do it, but the rest of the public do.
[01:38:23.156 --> 01:38:28.618]  It's all selectively enforced, like Obama decided what car dealerships stayed open, what didn't.
[01:38:28.638 --> 01:38:32.119]  $3 billion, the $25 billion for the auto bailout paid to move
[01:38:32.779 --> 01:38:38.260]  Factories on record, this is Associated Press, to Brazil, Eastern Europe, Russia, and China.
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:43.481]  So the globalists literally pay to have factories built for themselves.
[01:38:44.301 --> 01:38:54.783]  As Maury Strong said on TV in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro as the head of the UN Summit, it is our job to destroy industrial society in the West.
[01:38:55.524 --> 01:39:02.245]  Let's play this clip of Herman Van Rompuy in his acceptance speech as the new head of the EU calling for global governance.
[01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:10.295]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis.
[01:39:11.316 --> 01:39:17.760]  The climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet.
[01:39:20.042 --> 01:39:27.647]  Our mission, our presidency, is one of hope, supported by acts and by deeds.
[01:39:29.048 --> 01:39:29.308]  Okay.
[01:39:30.623 --> 01:39:33.906]  Again, there's Herman Van Rompuy, we have Van Ky Moon, Gordon Brown.
[01:39:34.026 --> 01:39:35.967]  Why are they coming out in the open now?
[01:39:36.268 --> 01:39:44.515]  Because we're approaching the 2011-12, which all the economists here say they believe is the time that everything's going to collapse.
[01:39:44.555 --> 01:39:46.616]  Are they getting us ready for global government?
[01:39:47.797 --> 01:39:54.443]  Oh yes, they're getting us ready for global government, even in the schools, intermediate schools, colleges.
[01:39:55.383 --> 01:39:59.567]  People are all whistling global government.
[01:40:01.583 --> 01:40:03.985]  It has infected our society already.
[01:40:05.026 --> 01:40:20.418]  They'll attract the people through the religious aspects of the government, through the promise of being able to buy or sell if you cooperate with the global government.
[01:40:20.858 --> 01:40:23.520]  If you don't cooperate, you won't be able to buy or sell.
[01:40:24.403 --> 01:40:31.489]  That's been prophesied in the Bible, and I think that we're headed for that very soon when we have only one bank.
[01:40:33.129 --> 01:40:35.550]  And they're openly saying that's their program.
[01:40:35.570 --> 01:40:43.933]  This global private banking government will decide if you can have a business, if you can have a factory, if you can have a job, if you can have your farm, you own.
[01:40:43.953 --> 01:40:48.935]  I mean, this is really happening with the Animal ID, the Primus Society, all of it.
[01:40:49.275 --> 01:40:50.256]  That's why it's so... It's all happening.
[01:40:50.276 --> 01:40:50.716]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:51.176 --> 01:40:58.859]  In the Copenhagen 50, the Eco 15, whatever it was called, the Copenhagen, if we had
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:12.064]  If we had gone to the line and signed that document, we would have been giving away our rights to how much hot water we can use per day, what kind of car we'll drive.
[01:41:12.644 --> 01:41:18.946]  We would have made ourselves as the same common person in the world.
[01:41:19.466 --> 01:41:23.728]  And here we are, a blessed country, and we give it all up through Copenhagen 15.
[01:41:24.813 --> 01:41:28.314]  It's not enough for these bankers to rob and loot and run their scams.
[01:41:28.394 --> 01:41:32.095]  They want to shut off our resources to make us completely dependent on them.
[01:41:32.135 --> 01:41:33.336]  We're going to calls now.
[01:41:33.856 --> 01:41:37.077]  I want to encourage everybody to go to TheBigBadBank.com.
[01:41:37.097 --> 01:41:39.037]  TheBigBadBank.com.
[01:41:39.317 --> 01:41:41.418]  We have links to it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:41:41.438 --> 01:41:43.339]  TheBigBadBank.com.
[01:41:43.819 --> 01:41:47.700]  And to get your video and book, both titled The Big Bad Bank.
[01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:51.622]  Also, while you're at it, folks, get, follow the Republic.
[01:41:51.682 --> 01:42:00.486]  It details who the bankers are, how they're imploding the economy by design, their own statements, their own documents, how they're using the environmental movement, the police state they're setting up to enforce it.
[01:42:01.306 --> 01:42:05.188]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement covers the depopulation, their entire program.
[01:42:05.668 --> 01:42:06.829]  Everyone must see this.
[01:42:06.889 --> 01:42:07.649]  This is real.
[01:42:08.009 --> 01:42:08.770]  They're doing it.
[01:42:09.070 --> 01:42:10.450]  You ask, what is the solution?
[01:42:10.651 --> 01:42:11.411]  Education.
[01:42:11.531 --> 01:42:15.573]  Show the people that environmentalism has nothing to do with the environment.
[01:42:15.973 --> 01:42:18.154]  They co-opt all these good people to serve them.
[01:42:18.534 --> 01:42:19.855]  This is their takeover.
[01:42:19.935 --> 01:42:24.777]  And it's in trouble, but they've invested hundreds of billions conservatively in this propaganda.
[01:42:25.057 --> 01:42:28.339]  They're moving forward with it, but they're beginning to slow.
[01:42:28.839 --> 01:42:33.522]  If you take action and educate everyone you know, we can stop these people.
[01:42:33.562 --> 01:42:38.944]  So get the films at InfoWars.com or watch them in high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:42:39.444 --> 01:42:40.285]  Let's go to calls.
[01:42:40.545 --> 01:42:42.406]  Let's talk to Mike in Pennsylvania.
[01:42:42.446 --> 01:42:44.607]  You're on the air with George Hunt.
[01:42:45.578 --> 01:42:47.339]  Yeah, a question for the guests.
[01:42:48.979 --> 01:43:01.084]  When you had met with the elites, had they had mentioned anything about, this was in the late 80s from my understanding from what you're saying, anything about government-sponsored terror, in particular 9-11, being carried out in the future?
[01:43:01.164 --> 01:43:03.625]  Staging crises, staging terror attacks.
[01:43:04.726 --> 01:43:13.769]  No, there was nothing mentioned of a war or warfare or anti-terrorist.
[01:43:14.009 --> 01:43:15.190]  Nothing like that came up.
[01:43:17.438 --> 01:43:22.724]  They talked about using the threat of environmental catastrophe, which is another form of false Florida.
[01:43:23.866 --> 01:43:27.050]  Yeah, I missed that.
[01:43:27.891 --> 01:43:35.280]  Ross Charles said that we were doomed to extinction if we didn't accept its bank in this program.
[01:43:35.885 --> 01:43:36.726]  He will save us.
[01:43:37.066 --> 01:43:40.970]  And now his son, we're told in the newspaper, is a Jesus archetype.
[01:43:41.050 --> 01:43:41.450]  Literally.
[01:43:41.490 --> 01:43:46.655]  I mean, you can't make this type of bizarreness up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:47.175 --> 01:43:48.056]  The hero gene.
[01:43:48.076 --> 01:43:49.898]  Inside talks about him being a Jesus figure.
[01:43:50.178 --> 01:43:51.019]  Anything else, Mike?
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:58.606]  Dallas, do you think then that the right wing arm of the New World Order like this might be the left wing arm?
[01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.851]  Yes.
[01:44:00.031 --> 01:44:04.917]  You know, that carries out gun-responsive terror.
[01:44:05.277 --> 01:44:05.537]  Yes.
[01:44:06.118 --> 01:44:07.459]  Both parties, both groups do it.
[01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:10.303]  But yes, the Club of Rome said in 91...
[01:44:11.738 --> 01:44:16.160]  That they will use, on the left, phony environmentalism, on the right, staged terror.
[01:44:16.761 --> 01:44:17.641]  We have those quotes.
[01:44:18.321 --> 01:44:19.162]  They published them.
[01:44:19.482 --> 01:44:22.524]  We have them in articles that Paul Watson's written with direct links.
[01:44:22.564 --> 01:44:25.385]  They said they will use that pincer to capture us.
[01:44:25.525 --> 01:44:27.867]  On the right, they'll use security and terror.
[01:44:28.207 --> 01:44:29.367]  On the left, the environment.
[01:44:29.607 --> 01:44:30.688]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[01:44:30.908 --> 01:44:32.009]  Comments on that, George Hunt?
[01:44:34.690 --> 01:44:36.251]  Oh, yes.
[01:44:36.911 --> 01:44:39.433]  The Club of Rome is the
[01:44:41.531 --> 01:45:06.038]  The group that was brought up indirectly at the Congress because Gro Harlem Bruteland, the lady that accepted Rothschild's banking program, she was there and she's the one that heads up the elimination of people on the planet.
[01:45:08.469 --> 01:45:15.951]  She's also the chairman, I think, of the United Nations UNED Committee, U-N-E-D.
[01:45:16.531 --> 01:45:18.571]  It's called the Brookland Committee.
[01:45:19.011 --> 01:45:25.472]  The UNED is the one that created UNCED, isn't that a funny name?
[01:45:25.972 --> 01:45:35.714]  That's the United Nations Commission on Environment and Development, and that's the one that Rothschild was the, or not
[01:45:36.212 --> 01:45:40.496]  That Maury Strong was the Secretary General.
[01:45:41.116 --> 01:45:42.237]  Alright, let's take another call.
[01:45:42.457 --> 01:45:44.659]  Herman in New York, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:45:44.679 --> 01:45:47.301]  Uh, yes sir, Alex, can you hear me?
[01:45:47.801 --> 01:45:48.102]  Yes sir.
[01:45:49.563 --> 01:45:54.727]  Yeah, so first thing I have a comment, first thing I have a comment and I have a question and I'll take my answer off air.
[01:45:54.767 --> 01:46:05.636]  First comment is, uh, I repost all your articles on my Facebook page, facebook.com slash one zero zero B-I-L-L-I-O-N, and my question for
[01:46:06.415 --> 01:46:12.056]  Mr. Hunt, what's the most important part of the eugenics movement that should be highlighted and exposed?
[01:46:12.176 --> 01:46:19.077]  Because when I just say eugenics, and I just speak of the issue, it's a bit much for the average person to comprehend and follow.
[01:46:19.097 --> 01:46:20.137]  Well, they better learn.
[01:46:20.177 --> 01:46:25.558]  Herman's asking again, what is the most important part of their depopulation agenda?
[01:46:27.379 --> 01:46:35.340]  Well, the most important part is to eliminate the people who are destroying
[01:46:36.058 --> 01:46:37.119]  The environment.
[01:46:38.922 --> 01:46:46.030]  If you look at pictures from the Bruinland Report, that's still available, I believe, from the United Nations.
[01:46:46.511 --> 01:46:54.541]  If you look at the pictures, it shows pictures of indigenous people who it's better to die
[01:46:55.447 --> 01:46:56.067]  Than to live.
[01:47:16.721 --> 01:47:17.461]  Yes, Alex.
[01:47:17.901 --> 01:47:18.181]  Yes.
[01:47:18.682 --> 01:47:19.982]  Hey, I got a question.
[01:47:20.582 --> 01:47:22.503]  I'm the pastor, but here's my thing.
[01:47:22.543 --> 01:47:25.924]  You've been doing this, and he's talking about it, too, as far as this banking.
[01:47:26.024 --> 01:47:26.804]  They're bankers.
[01:47:27.884 --> 01:47:34.666]  Well, you've even asked, and you've asked for solutions and things like that, and people are all looking for solutions, and I think I've come up with one.
[01:47:35.846 --> 01:47:36.466]  And here it is.
[01:47:37.207 --> 01:47:38.127]  If everybody
[01:47:38.746 --> 01:47:44.631]  Quit paying on their credit cards, because these bankers are going to bankrupt the banks anyway.
[01:47:45.232 --> 01:47:46.933]  They're going to take their money out of the banks.
[01:47:47.554 --> 01:47:53.919]  And I know this is going to have an effect, because 316,000 people have left California.
[01:47:54.599 --> 01:47:56.401]  And look at the effect it's having on that.
[01:47:56.561 --> 01:48:03.287]  If people in every state just up and just quit paying on their credit cards, just up and stop it,
[01:48:05.439 --> 01:48:19.665]  I mean, I'll say this, it's a very complex issue, but yes, the banks would then just get a bailout to themselves of our tax money to pay it.
[01:48:20.085 --> 01:48:28.108]  But by people not, and I'm not saying do this, it's your decision, by not supporting the system before they're ready to crash it, that will screw them up.
[01:48:28.148 --> 01:48:29.609]  And that's why they want global government.
[01:48:29.869 --> 01:48:31.330]  They talk about tax avoidance.
[01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:32.971]  Well, you know, I never thought of those
[01:49:02.286 --> 01:49:02.767]  I think?
[01:49:22.230 --> 01:49:37.458]  Well, also, again, they're putting their cashless thumbprint face scan buying and selling in so that if you're not in good graces with Homeland Security and with the global security network they've set up in Interpol, you won't be allowed to buy and sell even if you have the cash.
[01:49:37.858 --> 01:49:39.459]  That's what the cashless society is.
[01:49:39.499 --> 01:49:44.482]  You'll still have cash, you've just got an ID to do it, and they've openly announced they want that.
[01:49:44.522 --> 01:49:46.663]  I mean, they are coming in to squeeze you.
[01:49:46.723 --> 01:49:47.943]  They want to bankrupt you.
[01:49:47.963 --> 01:49:48.924]  They want to control you.
[01:49:50.163 --> 01:50:08.119]  I think for people who can, get into communities or loosely knit organizations rurally that decide to defend each other, decide to get each other out of debt, and then you've just got to wait for the tanks to come down the street whenever that happens and still be politically involved to try to stop that from happening.
[01:50:08.359 --> 01:50:12.442]  You've got to prepare for the worst, but also fight to stop it.
[01:50:13.684 --> 01:50:16.887]  Again, everything is multi-faceted.
[01:50:17.247 --> 01:50:25.635]  You can't just hide out in the country and wait for them to come, but you've also got to have communities, get to know your neighbors, understand who the enemy is, and say, we're going to stick together.
[01:50:25.755 --> 01:50:34.103]  Everything the globalists do is about dividing us so we can't stick together, so they can individually come like wolves and rip our guts out.
[01:50:34.770 --> 01:50:36.772]  That's what they do overseas, too.
[01:50:37.132 --> 01:50:46.861]  They get the Shiites against the Hussites against the Jebusites, and they get these... They rile the countries up by getting the religions fighting against one another.
[01:50:59.657 --> 01:51:07.160]  Air and Aqua dot com is your one stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:11.481]  Air and Aqua dot com knows exactly what doesn't belong in our air and our water.
[01:51:11.682 --> 01:51:15.663]  And they know exactly how to help you rid your home or office of these harmful toxins.
[01:51:15.983 --> 01:51:20.525]  Did you know that your skin actually absorbs more chlorine while you shower than from the water you drink?
[01:51:20.745 --> 01:51:24.426]  Air and Aqua dot com can help you eliminate dangerous chlorine from your water.
[01:51:24.666 --> 01:51:28.808]  Air and Aqua dot com carries atmospheric water generators, glass water bottles,
[01:51:29.088 --> 01:51:29.668]  We're good to go!
[01:52:00.729 --> 01:52:04.397]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:04.797 --> 01:52:07.763]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:08.004 --> 01:52:09.427]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:52:10.326 --> 01:52:12.787]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:12.807 --> 01:52:19.030]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:19.190 --> 01:52:24.212]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:24.733 --> 01:52:34.357]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:34.477 --> 01:52:36.597]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:36.818 --> 01:52:38.138]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:38.418 --> 01:52:40.678]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:40.878 --> 01:52:42.699]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:42.999 --> 01:52:47.780]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:57.262]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:00.131 --> 01:53:06.459]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:53:06.819 --> 01:53:12.947]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:53:13.227 --> 01:53:19.215]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[01:53:19.535 --> 01:53:24.477]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[01:53:24.937 --> 01:53:32.779]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.

[01:54:01.775 --> 01:54:08.138]  The preacher man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River, she's a gold drive.
[01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:19.003]  The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[01:54:26.699 --> 01:54:28.600]  They don't like you being self-sufficient.
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:37.247]  They don't like it when you've got a four-wheel drive, a shotgun, a rifle, you know how to run a trot line, know how to grow tomatoes and homemade wine.
[01:54:37.747 --> 01:54:40.829]  They want you under their control.
[01:54:42.351 --> 01:54:44.973]  Animal ID, Primitive Society is all you in.
[01:54:44.993 --> 01:54:46.994]  They're taking over your local communities.
[01:54:47.034 --> 01:54:49.396]  They're putting fake environmentalists in to run your life.
[01:54:49.796 --> 01:54:51.878]  These are the equivalent of Soviet commissars.
[01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:54.901]  You've got to stand up against him.
[01:54:54.981 --> 01:54:56.963]  Crank up Hank Williams Jr.
[01:54:56.983 --> 01:54:57.663]  I'm not done with him.
[01:54:57.683 --> 01:54:59.745]  I want people to hear this part.
[01:55:02.347 --> 01:55:06.010]  They don't like the country boys, whether you're black, white, old, young.
[01:55:06.630 --> 01:55:08.672]  They don't like the fact that you're self-sufficient.
[01:55:08.692 --> 01:55:09.933]  They don't like the fact that you...
[01:55:10.469 --> 01:55:11.710]  That they can't make you run.
[01:55:12.952 --> 01:55:15.374]  That they can't starve you out.
[01:55:15.394 --> 01:55:16.896]  That they can't control your life.
[01:55:17.617 --> 01:55:23.783]  And this is the key to defeating them, is being self-sufficient and getting out of debt and getting our republic back.
[01:55:24.124 --> 01:55:24.824]  Here it is!
[01:55:34.953 --> 01:55:37.855]  They don't have our guns.
[01:55:37.895 --> 01:55:40.916]  They don't have our farms like they do the Australians.
[01:55:41.236 --> 01:55:42.917]  They haven't gotten up to that point yet.
[01:55:42.957 --> 01:55:44.658]  We're going to stop them here cold.
[01:55:44.918 --> 01:55:48.960]  We're going to stop the New World Order right here.
[01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:50.321]  Look in the mirror.
[01:55:50.361 --> 01:55:51.621]  You're the resistance to it.
[01:55:51.642 --> 01:55:54.163]  We're going to have George Hunt back on in the near future.
[01:55:54.183 --> 01:55:57.384]  I really appreciate him spending so much time with us today.
[01:55:57.404 --> 01:55:59.626]  He's now known as the UN whistleblower online.
[01:56:00.066 --> 01:56:01.306]  Really devastated the enemy.
[01:56:01.326 --> 01:56:03.848]  20 plus years and it's really coming to fruit now.
[01:56:04.608 --> 01:56:06.029]  Let's go to Carl in Texas.
[01:56:06.089 --> 01:56:07.010]  Carl, you're on the air.
[01:56:07.070 --> 01:56:07.490]  Go ahead.
[01:56:08.471 --> 01:56:09.052]  Hey, Alex.
[01:56:09.092 --> 01:56:09.932]  How you doing, man?
[01:56:10.433 --> 01:56:10.753]  Good.
[01:56:10.773 --> 01:56:12.314]  Hey, look.
[01:56:12.514 --> 01:56:18.559]  I had a question for you and for George, but I guess if George is gone, I can ask you... No, George isn't gone.
[01:56:18.599 --> 01:56:19.180]  George is here.
[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:19.620]  Oh, good.
[01:56:19.981 --> 01:56:20.701]  Good, good, good.
[01:56:22.182 --> 01:56:25.265]  Actually, Alex, you've really... You've inspired me.
[01:56:25.325 --> 01:56:28.467]  We actually filed bankruptcy about a year and a half ago.
[01:56:29.348 --> 01:56:32.531]  Well, actually, we were starting the process and we made it all official.
[01:56:32.971 --> 01:56:33.952]  But during that time,
[01:56:34.804 --> 01:56:38.166]  I questioned the dollar, wanted to find out everything I could about the dollar.
[01:56:38.506 --> 01:56:47.731]  The bottom line is, we found out everything we needed to know, and I thought all the stuff that I was learning about that Orwellian Theory about 1984, I thought initially was a joke.
[01:56:48.531 --> 01:56:49.652]  And it's not.
[01:56:49.692 --> 01:56:50.592]  The stuff is real.
[01:56:50.872 --> 01:56:51.593]  I'm 43.
[01:56:51.913 --> 01:56:53.093]  I know it's very real.
[01:56:53.994 --> 01:56:59.897]  But you've actually inspired me to start another business that sells home security and personal protection products.
[01:57:00.697 --> 01:57:03.561]  But one question I had for you, because I'm a fighter.
[01:57:03.742 --> 01:57:04.302]  I'm like you.
[01:57:04.523 --> 01:57:05.124]  I'm a fighter.
[01:57:05.284 --> 01:57:05.825]  I don't like to run away.
[01:57:05.845 --> 01:57:06.185]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:57:06.205 --> 01:57:06.846]  We don't have a lot of time.
[01:57:06.866 --> 01:57:07.928]  We got George on here with you.
[01:57:07.968 --> 01:57:08.308]  Go ahead.
[01:57:08.949 --> 01:57:12.955]  But you did mention in one of your other episodes, you said, hey, things become too unstable.
[01:57:13.897 --> 01:57:15.179]  I'd go to a third world country.
[01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:19.022]  But how welcomed would we be in another country?
[01:57:19.042 --> 01:57:19.743]  In what country?
[01:57:19.783 --> 01:57:21.844]  No, this is going to be a global depression.
[01:57:21.904 --> 01:57:23.225]  I've said there's nowhere to run.
[01:57:23.245 --> 01:57:35.793]  I've said if there was some free country I could go to, like my ancestors on the Mayflower, on my father and mother's side, on the Jones side, Captain Jones of the Mayflower, on my mother's side, two members of the Mayflower, I would do that.
[01:57:36.014 --> 01:57:37.415]  There's nowhere to go.
[01:57:37.495 --> 01:57:40.076]  We stand, we fight, we stop them here.
[01:57:40.477 --> 01:57:41.557]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:41.637 --> 01:57:42.638]  Good to hear from you, Carl.
[01:57:42.918 --> 01:57:45.520]  Comments on what he just said, George Hunt.
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:50.402]  Well, my wife's ancestor was on the Mayflower, too.
[01:57:50.462 --> 01:57:51.763]  They must have been shipmates.
[01:57:55.204 --> 01:57:55.724]  I don't know.
[01:57:56.225 --> 01:58:02.087]  I don't really know the question that came up, but since this... Nowhere to run!
[01:58:02.167 --> 01:58:03.008]  Nowhere to run!
[01:58:03.068 --> 01:58:12.352]  He's saying, this is... I just want to bring up again that Maury Strong, it looks like he's been rewarded with an $8 billion payoff.
[01:58:12.932 --> 01:58:14.993]  I'm going to launch
[01:58:15.652 --> 01:58:16.633]  Hold on!
[01:58:16.833 --> 01:58:17.973]  Hold on!
[01:58:18.013 --> 01:58:21.516]  We're gonna do five more minutes.
[01:58:21.616 --> 01:58:23.737]  I want you to be able to finish back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:23.757 --> 01:58:27.999]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:49.899 --> 01:58:52.519]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:52.919 --> 01:58:57.880]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:58:59.981]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:00.301 --> 01:59:05.102]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:05.282 --> 01:59:06.262]  How much do you want?
[01:59:06.462 --> 01:59:07.222]  When do you want it?
[01:59:07.602 --> 01:59:09.202]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:09.483 --> 01:59:10.303]  When will you need it?
[01:59:10.563 --> 01:59:12.623]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:12.763 --> 01:59:13.863]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:14.103 --> 01:59:15.444]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:15.624 --> 01:59:16.624]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:59:16.664 --> 01:59:17.044]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:33.537 --> 01:59:36.320]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:39.222]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:39.442 --> 01:59:40.243]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:40.263 --> 01:59:41.504]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:41.524 --> 01:59:43.546]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.841 --> 02:00:02.921]  Yeah.
[02:00:18.630 --> 02:00:20.451]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[02:00:20.511 --> 02:00:21.711]  I meant to do an hour interview.
[02:00:21.731 --> 02:00:25.652]  We're now past two hours, and I've got a ton of important stuff to cover.
[02:00:25.672 --> 02:00:28.073]  Coming up in the next segment, continue with your open phones.
[02:00:28.453 --> 02:00:30.394]  And all these callers are bringing up great points.
[02:00:30.414 --> 02:00:31.914]  I'm sorry to cut some people short.
[02:00:32.294 --> 02:00:33.495]  We just have limited time.
[02:00:33.855 --> 02:00:38.136]  But yes, George, we're going to have you back up, try to support your whistleblowing.
[02:00:38.436 --> 02:00:45.438]  Hopefully have you back up in the next few weeks so we can just take calls and talk about going after Maury Strong, the ClimateGate people, Ben Santer,
[02:00:47.964 --> 02:00:48.304]  All of them.
[02:00:48.485 --> 02:00:49.185]  Phil Jones.
[02:00:49.666 --> 02:00:52.788]  We need to have these people exposed and indicted.
[02:00:52.808 --> 02:00:55.451]  A lot of them already are in the process or have been indicted.
[02:00:55.951 --> 02:00:58.153]  But let's go to Bob in Ohio.
[02:00:58.453 --> 02:01:00.995]  You're on the air in a final quick segment with George Hunt.
[02:01:01.056 --> 02:01:01.816]  Amazing interview.
[02:01:02.116 --> 02:01:03.458]  We appreciate George's courage.
[02:01:03.758 --> 02:01:04.579]  Bob, you're on the air.
[02:01:04.619 --> 02:01:05.019]  Go ahead.
[02:01:05.479 --> 02:01:06.120]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:06.841]  Good.
[02:01:07.922 --> 02:01:12.746]  I've been meaning to call for a long time and it's crazy how apropos this call will be today.
[02:01:13.707 --> 02:01:25.420]  I moved into the sticks early 90s about the same time period and I became associated with someone who claimed to be in league or knew of the elites and was close personal friends with him.
[02:01:25.941 --> 02:01:32.909]  He tapped me as a guy who was intelligent and for some reason wanted me to know some facts and he asked me if I ever knew about
[02:01:33.635 --> 02:01:41.537]  The New World Order and the Trilateral Commission and those things, and I told him I knew some things, and so he invited me to ask him some questions.
[02:01:41.597 --> 02:01:45.558]  I said, how will we know when the New World Order is going to be installed?
[02:01:46.018 --> 02:01:50.119]  Or first, first, I said, how will they go about installing it?
[02:01:50.139 --> 02:01:58.001]  Because they'll get us in so many conflicts around the globe that we won't be able to defend ourselves, and a seemingly foreign power would step in and take us over.
[02:01:58.561 --> 02:02:01.262]  I said, how will we know when it's about to happen?
[02:02:01.843 --> 02:02:04.104]  And he said, if they ever hit the Pentagon, look out.
[02:02:04.945 --> 02:02:07.926]  And it was whenever 9-11 happened to me.
[02:02:07.946 --> 02:02:09.627]  And of course, that was years before that.
[02:02:09.968 --> 02:02:12.529]  And this guy said that he was a member of the elite.
[02:02:13.369 --> 02:02:14.890]  He was affiliated with them.
[02:02:15.190 --> 02:02:16.791]  He was a very intelligent man.
[02:02:16.831 --> 02:02:17.772]  They love to brag.
[02:02:18.212 --> 02:02:20.153]  George Hunt comments on what Bob just said.
[02:02:20.834 --> 02:02:21.914]  Oh, they love to brag.
[02:02:22.134 --> 02:02:27.337]  And I wish that you had a recorder with you when you're talking to that person.
[02:02:27.677 --> 02:02:30.519]  They were one of the ones that were in the know.
[02:02:31.289 --> 02:02:39.052]  And they like people to know that they're in the know, but if anyone finds out that they've told their secrets, they get killed.
[02:02:40.032 --> 02:02:44.614]  Bob, call us back again sometime, because I want to hear more of your story.
[02:02:44.654 --> 02:02:45.014]  Thank you.
[02:02:45.194 --> 02:02:46.295]  Finishing up, George, go ahead.
[02:02:47.235 --> 02:02:59.580]  Well, I don't know how to finish this, except that we are confronted with a new world order that will take away the freedom of every citizen in the world, and if we don't
[02:03:01.385 --> 02:03:03.927]  If we don't call them out now, we never will.
[02:03:05.608 --> 02:03:06.489]  This is our last chance.
[02:03:23.201 --> 02:03:29.006]  And so people need to see themselves as leaders, wake up their friends, their families, their neighbors, educate them.
[02:03:29.126 --> 02:03:31.227]  Films are a great way to do it.
[02:03:31.307 --> 02:03:32.848]  Radio shows are a great way to do it.
[02:03:33.129 --> 02:03:34.690]  Read books, get educated yourself.
[02:03:35.150 --> 02:03:36.671]  Educate your city council.
[02:03:37.172 --> 02:03:41.455]  When these environmentalists come around, they want to steal your property, brainwash your kids.
[02:03:41.935 --> 02:03:43.656]  On record, they've got to be stopped.
[02:03:43.837 --> 02:03:47.740]  And George, I'm glad you're doing an investigation on Maury Strong and others.
[02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:49.301]  You're talking about filing suit on them.
[02:03:51.082 --> 02:04:05.696]  I'll be filing suit within two weeks and after I find a lawyer that is up to the fight.
[02:04:06.417 --> 02:04:15.065]  And then after they're sued, they'll probably pay some heavy fines and I'll get 30% of their heavy fines because I'm an official.
[02:04:15.655 --> 02:04:16.835]  Whistleblower.
[02:04:17.316 --> 02:04:20.097]  So there's something in it for people that blow whistles.
[02:04:38.743 --> 02:04:43.807]  And again, Endgame at Infowars.com, the preeminent film to expose this entire agenda.
[02:04:44.228 --> 02:04:54.976]  George, let me say bye to you during the break, and we're going to be talking to you again, and Jan and other great folks in your office, about having you back on in Phase 2 of our operation against the New World Order.
[02:04:55.256 --> 02:04:59.600]  I'm going to come back with all the government health care news, the banking news, the flu news.
[02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:00.561]  What's your home worth?
[02:05:00.721 --> 02:05:02.663]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:05:02.843 --> 02:05:05.525]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[02:05:05.865 --> 02:05:13.371]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of the tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[02:05:13.571 --> 02:05:17.033]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.
[02:05:17.234 --> 02:05:19.355]  It's so easy, and best of all, it's free.

[02:05:27.962 --> 02:05:30.944]  Go to HomeGain.com and get an instant home value estimate.
[02:05:31.144 --> 02:05:31.764]  We're good to go!
[02:06:01.036 --> 02:06:04.704]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:05.084 --> 02:06:08.070]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:08.311 --> 02:06:09.734]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:06:10.416 --> 02:06:13.078]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:13.099 --> 02:06:19.344]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:19.484 --> 02:06:24.529]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:06:24.689 --> 02:06:34.678]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:06:34.778 --> 02:06:36.880]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:38.461]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:38.722 --> 02:06:41.004]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:41.184 --> 02:06:43.026]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:06:43.306 --> 02:06:48.070]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:06:48.451 --> 02:06:57.579]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:00.359 --> 02:07:01.600]  This is an emergency alert.
[02:07:02.121 --> 02:07:04.203]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[02:07:04.543 --> 02:07:07.546]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[02:07:08.086 --> 02:07:12.330]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[02:07:12.871 --> 02:07:18.036]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[02:07:18.616 --> 02:07:22.862]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[02:07:23.122 --> 02:07:29.150]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[02:07:29.571 --> 02:07:30.833]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[02:07:31.213 --> 02:07:34.618]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier.
[02:07:34.998 --> 02:07:35.718]  We're good to go.
[02:08:01.084 --> 02:08:07.138]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:10.726]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.654 --> 02:08:16.617]  In the spirit of 2010, I've told you that I am going to take more calls.
[02:08:17.198 --> 02:08:21.882]  I was getting to where I went two or three shows sometimes without taking calls because I'm covering news and have guests on.
[02:08:21.922 --> 02:08:25.765]  I'm going to talk to Joe, John, Dave, Brian and Dennis in this segment.
[02:08:26.205 --> 02:08:30.989]  And in the last 40 minutes, I am going to cover BankerGate.
[02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:35.212]  What's happening with the flu blowing up in their face?
[02:08:35.392 --> 02:08:39.835]  Openly exposed as fraud and a criminal hoax, exactly as we said it was.
[02:08:39.895 --> 02:08:42.377]  We're vindicated, documented, proven again.
[02:08:43.417 --> 02:08:44.858]  Also, what's happening with health care?
[02:08:45.859 --> 02:08:47.280]  It's all coming up.
[02:08:48.461 --> 02:08:56.005]  But man, what an amazing two-hour interview with George Hunt, who just got out of the hospital with Guillaume Baret.
[02:08:56.686 --> 02:08:58.167]  Glad to hear that he's doing better.
[02:09:00.009 --> 02:09:01.270]  So many people get that now.
[02:09:01.770 --> 02:09:02.991]  Not just from vaccines.
[02:09:03.051 --> 02:09:03.732]  It's pretty spooky.
[02:09:03.772 --> 02:09:06.154]  All the barium salts, aluminum dioxide being sprayed on us.
[02:09:06.734 --> 02:09:13.719]  They're spiking more than half, according to the Washington Post, of the corn syrup with mercury, telling you it's nutritious.
[02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:14.860]  I'm not kidding.
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:15.841]  Saying it's not nutritious.
[02:09:15.901 --> 02:09:16.681]  It's not nutritious.
[02:09:16.721 --> 02:09:17.382]  It eats your brain.
[02:09:17.782 --> 02:09:19.804]  So we're glad that George is doing better.
[02:09:21.385 --> 02:09:23.547]  Just amazing inside information.
[02:09:24.207 --> 02:09:25.868]  All documented 22 years later.
[02:09:25.948 --> 02:09:27.289]  Proven in triplicate.
[02:09:27.429 --> 02:09:28.310]  Proven in spades.
[02:09:31.499 --> 02:09:35.162]  I'm going to jam in five calls here in T-minus minute and a half.
[02:09:36.764 --> 02:09:43.489]  So be ready with your questions, your comments, your plugs, your tractor you've got for sale, whatever it is.
[02:09:43.789 --> 02:09:44.410]  That's coming up.
[02:09:44.750 --> 02:09:48.273]  But speaking of folks that make this show possible, I want to tell you about those guys right now.
[02:09:50.275 --> 02:09:54.298]  That is Diginet Personal Audio Video Recording Systems.
[02:09:54.839 --> 02:09:56.821]  Sunglasses with the little bubble chip.
[02:09:59.209 --> 02:10:02.991]  In them that record hours of video and audio, hidden camera in the sunglasses.
[02:10:03.332 --> 02:10:06.253]  Great because sometimes with a hidden camera you don't know what you're shooting.
[02:10:06.494 --> 02:10:09.576]  But with sunglasses, if I'd have had that in Bohemian Grove, my goodness.
[02:10:10.056 --> 02:10:11.997]  Because you turn your head, you know what you're shooting.
[02:10:12.397 --> 02:10:18.361]  Just amazing system, very inexpensive, high quality, hidden DigiNet pins, a bunch of other great products.
[02:10:18.381 --> 02:10:23.624]  They're a huge seller to government, you name it, and corporations, so you get the lowest prices I've seen.
[02:10:23.644 --> 02:10:25.866]  Before I knew about this company, I paid double.
[02:10:26.446 --> 02:10:28.408]  For the similar systems, I thought I was getting a good deal.
[02:10:28.768 --> 02:10:37.356]  Diginet.net, D-I-G-A-N-E-T.net, Diginet.net, D-I-G-A-N-E-T.net, Diginet.net.
[02:10:37.656 --> 02:10:39.178]  Their phone number is also on their website.
[02:10:39.458 --> 02:10:40.659]  Check them out today.
[02:10:41.019 --> 02:10:43.161]  Also, survivalseedbank.com.
[02:10:43.201 --> 02:10:43.802]  Give them a call, 877-327-0365.
[02:10:48.015 --> 02:10:52.220]  Super high quality, organic, non-hybrid, non-GMO seeds.
[02:10:53.802 --> 02:10:57.566]  Get a seed bank you plant with this spring coming up in two months or so.
[02:10:57.726 --> 02:11:00.950]  So cold though, might come up in three months with the global warming and all.
[02:11:01.711 --> 02:11:02.612]  I wish we had some warming.
[02:11:03.113 --> 02:11:06.336]  Survivalseedbank.com and then save a seed bank or give it as a gift.
[02:11:07.277 --> 02:11:09.599]  This is just such, again, it's human.
[02:11:09.799 --> 02:11:12.160]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:18.004]  Getting back to nature, getting back to true sustainability, getting back to the earth, and not the globalist counterfeit of it.
[02:11:18.264 --> 02:11:19.505]  Survivalseabank.com or 877-327-0365.
[02:11:19.525 --> 02:11:19.705]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:11:19.725 --> 02:11:20.305]  Survivalseabank.com.
[02:11:27.364 --> 02:11:35.248]  And finally, I have looked at a lot of countries, and if you do, I know the health rangers move down there, a lot of people are, especially in the mountain areas.
[02:11:35.288 --> 02:11:39.450]  It's like 65 to 70 degrees year-round, above 5,000 feet.
[02:11:40.430 --> 02:11:41.331]  One of the better places.
[02:11:42.401 --> 02:11:42.842]  I don't think so.
[02:11:59.039 --> 02:12:03.801]  Ecuador is a country with friendly people, good food, and great weather all year round where you can live better for a lot less.
[02:12:03.861 --> 02:12:04.581]  Boy, that's the truth.
[02:12:05.121 --> 02:12:06.522]  EcuadorCentral.com.
[02:12:06.542 --> 02:12:07.823]  That's Ecuador Central.
[02:12:08.243 --> 02:12:10.844]  Ecuador spelled E-C-U-A-D-O-R.
[02:12:11.144 --> 02:12:13.365]  That's EcuadorCentral.com.
[02:12:13.685 --> 02:12:15.226]  Check them out today.
[02:12:15.246 --> 02:12:18.807]  They have a lot of audio and video clips up there on the site as well.
[02:12:19.207 --> 02:12:20.227]  Okay, boom!
[02:12:20.548 --> 02:12:23.469]  Let's take five calls in the next eight minutes, and then I'm going to news.
[02:12:23.849 --> 02:12:24.889]  Joe in Pennsylvania.
[02:12:24.929 --> 02:12:26.070]  You're on... Oh, I already went to Joe.
[02:12:26.590 --> 02:12:27.351]  Is this a new list?
[02:12:27.451 --> 02:12:29.312]  Because I already thought I had a Joe in Pennsylvania.
[02:12:31.534 --> 02:12:32.154]  Okay, new list.
[02:12:32.194 --> 02:12:33.215]  Another Joe in Pennsylvania.
[02:12:33.255 --> 02:12:33.655]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:12:33.675 --> 02:12:35.056]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:12:35.957 --> 02:12:36.557]  Good, go ahead.
[02:12:36.957 --> 02:12:39.679]  Yeah, I'm a great fan of yours, and thank you for waking me up.
[02:12:39.939 --> 02:12:41.461]  I've been following you for the longest time.
[02:12:41.941 --> 02:12:45.804]  And I've been passing the disc around, I've got copies, I've got covers.
[02:12:45.844 --> 02:12:47.105]  I also have a following behind me.
[02:12:47.485 --> 02:12:49.927]  Anyway, your show is fantastic, as always.
[02:12:50.487 --> 02:12:52.869]  And I'm glad you're a whistleblower.
[02:12:53.209 --> 02:12:56.131]  I put a lot of your videos on my website.
[02:12:56.750 --> 02:12:59.793]  And I just want to say hello, and I'm out here plugging for you, son.
[02:12:59.893 --> 02:13:00.814]  Oh, no, no, it's a plug.
[02:13:00.854 --> 02:13:01.895]  Go, please, please.
[02:13:01.975 --> 02:13:02.876]  Yeah, I'm plugging.
[02:13:02.896 --> 02:13:04.377]  Okay, can I give my address today?
[02:13:04.397 --> 02:13:05.298]  Yeah, go ahead, sir.
[02:13:05.498 --> 02:13:08.401]  That's H-O-P-E-S Fort Tavara dot org.
[02:13:08.841 --> 02:13:11.143]  I've got a lot of your videos, a lot of stuff up there.
[02:13:11.503 --> 02:13:12.364]  I've got a comeback.
[02:13:12.464 --> 02:13:14.546]  I've got videos out on my job.
[02:13:14.606 --> 02:13:16.028]  I've got to pick up the chemtrails.
[02:13:16.628 --> 02:13:17.109]  Everything.
[02:13:17.349 --> 02:13:18.210]  And I'm so happy.
[02:13:18.230 --> 02:13:19.631]  Well, that's awesome, Joe.
[02:13:19.711 --> 02:13:22.814]  Other than your website, what else is going on?
[02:13:23.747 --> 02:13:25.289]  I got a big mailing list every day.
[02:13:25.349 --> 02:13:30.774]  I spend like five hours putting out all your... So you're fighting hard and that's why we're starting to really, really have an effect.
[02:13:30.814 --> 02:13:31.555]  I gotta move quick.
[02:13:31.595 --> 02:13:32.216]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:13:32.977 --> 02:13:34.698]  John in New York, you're on the air.
[02:13:35.779 --> 02:13:36.760]  Hey Alex, how you doing today?
[02:13:37.541 --> 02:13:38.522]  Good, I'm doing alright.
[02:13:39.183 --> 02:13:39.343]  Good.
[02:13:39.643 --> 02:13:40.584]  I just had a question.
[02:13:40.624 --> 02:13:44.808]  You actually said one of them about the... Have you seen the commercials for the corn syrup now?
[02:13:45.169 --> 02:13:46.290]  They're saying how good it is for you?
[02:13:46.991 --> 02:13:50.013]  Yep, mercury in corn syrup is yummy for your tummy.
[02:13:50.693 --> 02:13:52.194]  You care about your son or daughter?
[02:13:52.454 --> 02:13:54.115]  Give them corn syrup with mercury.
[02:13:54.635 --> 02:13:56.937]  I've got the newscast saying it's good for your child's brain.
[02:13:56.977 --> 02:13:58.037]  I mean, it's not, folks.
[02:13:58.057 --> 02:13:58.938]  It's deadly poison.
[02:13:59.198 --> 02:14:00.679]  But now that's a conspiracy theory.
[02:14:01.519 --> 02:14:04.161]  Yeah, there's these nuts that think mercury ain't good.
[02:14:04.881 --> 02:14:05.922]  People's crazy!
[02:14:06.102 --> 02:14:07.383]  Exactly.
[02:14:07.863 --> 02:14:08.303]  Ridiculous.
[02:14:08.543 --> 02:14:14.067]  My other question was, I happened to be flipping through the History Channel the other day, and I saw Earth 2100.
[02:14:14.107 --> 02:14:16.188]  I don't know if you've seen anything about this.
[02:14:16.969 --> 02:14:28.671]  It's like a poorly animated Japanese cartoon about how this family's traveling from California to New York because there's nothing but famine on the west coast.
[02:14:28.691 --> 02:14:40.973]  Yes, they've got scores of shows about death, famine, world government saving us, everyone's starving, or all these shows about humans are gone from the earth, it's an Eden, how beautiful it would be if we were all dead.
[02:14:41.253 --> 02:14:44.154]  It's just 24-7 creating a guilt complex
[02:14:45.077 --> 02:14:45.457]  It's terrible.
[02:14:45.477 --> 02:14:47.359]  I mean, it just gets your blood boiling right away.
[02:14:47.399 --> 02:14:49.500]  My son and I, he's 18, we listen to your show every single day.
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:57.725]  And it's like, as soon as we saw that, we watched it for a little while, you know, because we wanted to see what it was about, but we just couldn't do it.
[02:14:58.126 --> 02:14:58.546]  It's terrible.
[02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:16.880]  Yes, I think it's history.
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:17.741]  It might be discovery.
[02:15:17.761 --> 02:15:18.521]  I'm not sure.
[02:15:18.541 --> 02:15:19.601]  But don't worry.
[02:15:19.641 --> 02:15:20.141]  I'm familiar.
[02:15:20.181 --> 02:15:21.002]  I saw a blurb on it.
[02:15:21.322 --> 02:15:22.002]  Don't worry.
[02:15:22.042 --> 02:15:24.803]  At the end of the episodes, the global government will save us.
[02:15:25.283 --> 02:15:28.924]  I'm sure there's an environmental group fighting globally to stop it.
[02:15:28.984 --> 02:15:29.824]  They tried.
[02:15:30.124 --> 02:15:31.224]  No one listened.
[02:15:31.544 --> 02:15:35.886]  No one accepted Christ, Savior, Rothschild, the Christ.
[02:15:36.406 --> 02:15:37.746]  I appreciate your call, John.
[02:15:38.166 --> 02:15:39.086]  Dave in Maine.
[02:15:39.467 --> 02:15:40.327]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:15:40.387 --> 02:15:40.787]  Go ahead.
[02:15:42.014 --> 02:15:48.216]  Hi Alex, George mentioned earlier about the possibility of using an EMP and I wanted to remind the listeners
[02:15:48.849 --> 02:16:06.796]  ...of a book that was heavily pushed by Newt Gingrich called One Second After that talked about the effects of an EMP... Yeah, they could do a bunch of EMPs, blame it on Al-Qaeda, use the... The studies show EMPs would knock everything out, but it would cause a lot of disruption to satellites and systems based on it, and then use that as another false flag.
[02:16:06.816 --> 02:16:10.677]  Look, when you're evil, you don't have rules, and you're the governing authority.
[02:16:10.717 --> 02:16:13.258]  There's all these great ways to stage terror.
[02:16:14.699 --> 02:16:15.179]  Absolutely.
[02:16:15.519 --> 02:16:26.384]  We have a review of that book on our website and also just published a review and highlights of a book written almost 80 years ago by Bertrand Russell, which is absolutely amazing.
[02:16:27.465 --> 02:16:28.525]  Tell us your website.
[02:16:29.085 --> 02:16:30.286]  Tell us your website, Dave.
[02:16:31.246 --> 02:16:32.687]  Somethingmustbreak.net.
[02:16:33.827 --> 02:16:34.168]  Great.
[02:16:34.268 --> 02:16:39.530]  And any good articles people want us to post or link to, send them to writersandinfowars.com.
[02:16:39.570 --> 02:16:40.290]  I'd like to see that.
[02:16:40.570 --> 02:16:41.671]  Anything else, Dave?
[02:16:42.932 --> 02:16:43.472]  No, that's it.
[02:16:43.532 --> 02:16:45.172]  Thanks for all you do, Alex.
[02:16:45.272 --> 02:16:46.113]  I really appreciate it.
[02:16:46.333 --> 02:16:47.453]  Thank you so much, Dave.
[02:16:47.813 --> 02:16:51.374]  It isn't that I mind the plugs, it's just that sometimes every caller.
[02:16:52.034 --> 02:16:55.314]  But I guess that's evidence of how people are taking action.
[02:16:56.255 --> 02:16:57.695]  It just, it kills talk radio.
[02:16:57.715 --> 02:16:58.915]  Because people want to hear content.
[02:16:58.935 --> 02:16:59.775]  They want to hear your ideas.
[02:16:59.815 --> 02:17:03.436]  Like, hey, they want to hear about EMP and Newt Gingrich hyping it, which you're right, he did.
[02:17:04.156 --> 02:17:07.517]  And then it's, then there's, it's kind of overload.
[02:17:07.537 --> 02:17:08.157]  But that's okay.
[02:17:08.197 --> 02:17:08.497]  Whatever.
[02:17:09.696 --> 02:17:17.740]  I had to put a stop to it about 10 years ago for a while when people started calling in going, I got a tractor for sale, I'm in this town in Missouri, here's my number, literally.
[02:17:17.780 --> 02:17:18.440]  And I said, look!
[02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:19.821]  It stops there!
[02:17:20.561 --> 02:17:21.121]  It stops!
[02:17:23.442 --> 02:17:26.044]  Let's talk to Ryan in Alaska.
[02:17:26.104 --> 02:17:27.344]  Ryan, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:17:27.964 --> 02:17:28.485]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:17:29.005 --> 02:17:29.285]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:29.985 --> 02:17:33.107]  Yeah, regarding the whole banker gangster situation.
[02:17:34.474 --> 02:17:37.736]  Ben Bernanke was recently on the cover of Time Magazine as Person of the Year.
[02:17:38.237 --> 02:17:39.478]  Oh yeah, they give awards.
[02:17:39.958 --> 02:17:43.321]  Forbes is giving the award to the best corporation being Monsanto.
[02:17:43.601 --> 02:17:50.326]  They give evil people awards as like a sick joke and so the general yuppies go, well it must be good, they're getting awards.
[02:17:50.706 --> 02:17:51.927]  The bankers must be good.
[02:17:51.967 --> 02:17:54.048]  Time Magazine says Bernanke loves me.
[02:17:54.509 --> 02:17:55.790]  Mercury must be good.
[02:17:55.850 --> 02:17:58.432]  CBS News says it's good for my child.
[02:17:59.112 --> 02:18:01.314]  But they have convulsions when I give it to them.
[02:18:03.869 --> 02:18:04.549]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:18:04.850 --> 02:18:05.490]  Nobel Peace Prize.
[02:18:07.813 --> 02:18:08.373]  Anything else?
[02:18:08.854 --> 02:18:09.394]  Yes, I am.
[02:18:10.055 --> 02:18:11.717]  Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize also?
[02:18:12.177 --> 02:18:13.359]  Yes, it's all a sick joke.
[02:18:14.940 --> 02:18:18.224]  Well, your interview today, the clips are really terrifying.
[02:18:18.284 --> 02:18:21.187]  I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm scared.
[02:18:22.227 --> 02:18:22.907]  Well, you don't listen.
[02:18:23.348 --> 02:18:26.670]  When you hang out over a cliff, you get scared because that's instinct.
[02:18:26.930 --> 02:18:28.131]  Telling you, get away from the cliff.
[02:18:28.452 --> 02:18:29.953]  Well, the New World Order's got us cornered.
[02:18:29.973 --> 02:18:30.633]  We've got to fight them.
[02:18:30.653 --> 02:18:32.274]  We can't get away from this cliff.
[02:18:32.635 --> 02:18:34.076]  We've got to figure out how to scale it.
[02:18:34.776 --> 02:18:37.198]  And so, yes, you're meant to be concerned.
[02:18:37.638 --> 02:18:39.440]  But once you put fear into action,
[02:18:40.836 --> 02:18:42.017]  You don't have fear anymore.
[02:18:42.277 --> 02:18:45.080]  My only fear is that I'll get killed and won't be able to continue this work.
[02:18:45.620 --> 02:18:47.722]  My only fear is that I don't do a good enough job.
[02:18:48.003 --> 02:18:49.724]  My only fear is I won't work hard enough.
[02:18:49.985 --> 02:18:54.088]  My only fear is I'll get worldly and want to take off a little bit of time.
[02:18:54.429 --> 02:18:57.572]  But then I realize all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
[02:18:59.574 --> 02:19:01.355]  And I've had to realize I beat myself up.
[02:19:01.455 --> 02:19:02.355]  I can't do it all.
[02:19:03.256 --> 02:19:06.497]  And that's why it's so great to see the dividends of Liberty coming in.
[02:19:06.777 --> 02:19:09.118]  And we're really starting to have victories, Ryan.
[02:19:09.158 --> 02:19:10.058]  And that's what's exciting.
[02:19:10.078 --> 02:19:10.639]  God bless you.
[02:19:11.979 --> 02:19:13.140]  Okay.
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:17.922]  If Dennis, John, John, and Scott want to hold, I may be able to get to you towards the end of the show.
[02:19:18.262 --> 02:19:25.385]  But I do need to news blitz on BankerGate on our big victory against the Flumongers.
[02:19:26.625 --> 02:19:28.046]  Openly they're being exposed now.
[02:19:29.355 --> 02:19:38.300]  And on health care, it's all coming up after this quick break right here on the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:41.561]  And I'm here live Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[02:19:41.581 --> 02:19:43.102]  to 3 p.m., 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[02:19:43.142 --> 02:19:44.623]  Eastern, 11 a.m.
[02:19:44.643 --> 02:19:45.163]  to 3 p.m.
[02:19:45.223 --> 02:19:45.644]  Central.
[02:19:46.044 --> 02:19:49.546]  We have the free podcast on the Listen link at the top of InfoWars.com.
[02:19:49.566 --> 02:19:50.426]  Go subscribe to that.
[02:19:50.686 --> 02:19:51.967]  Tell your friends and family about it.
[02:19:52.007 --> 02:19:53.168]  Listen how they want, when they want.
[02:19:53.448 --> 02:19:54.708]  That's how you really help, too.
[02:19:54.928 --> 02:19:56.209]  This show is doing a lot of great work.
[02:19:56.229 --> 02:19:57.030]  Spread the word about it.
[02:19:57.070 --> 02:19:57.610]  I know you are.
[02:19:59.764 --> 02:20:01.344]  You may be new to freeze-dry foods.
[02:20:01.565 --> 02:20:03.145]  You may have storable food questions.
[02:20:03.385 --> 02:20:07.946]  You may want to buy your freeze-dried foods from a very reputable company and not go broke in the process.
[02:20:08.226 --> 02:20:09.827]  Welcome to the freeze-dry guy.
[02:20:10.007 --> 02:20:12.327]  Okay, actually, we're more than just one guy.
[02:20:12.447 --> 02:20:15.248]  We're a California-based company that's been serving our U.S.
[02:20:15.288 --> 02:20:21.010]  military and other government agencies with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[02:20:22.270 --> 02:20:24.652]  See all about us at freeze dry guy dot com.

[02:20:45.131 --> 02:20:46.732]  Isn't that what you want for your family?

[02:20:56.336 --> 02:20:57.436]  Freeze Dry Guy.
[02:20:57.536 --> 02:20:58.857]  The best you can buy.
[02:21:00.777 --> 02:21:04.439]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:04.779 --> 02:21:07.800]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:09.441]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:21:10.146 --> 02:21:12.807]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:12.827 --> 02:21:19.028]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:19.208 --> 02:21:24.229]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:24.249 --> 02:21:27.550]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:21:27.570 --> 02:21:34.371]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:34.491 --> 02:21:36.613]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:36.853 --> 02:21:38.174]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:38.434 --> 02:21:40.696]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:40.896 --> 02:21:42.738]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:43.018 --> 02:21:47.782]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:48.182 --> 02:21:52.966]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:21:53.186 --> 02:21:57.289]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:59.648 --> 02:22:00.028]  Good day.
[02:22:00.248 --> 02:22:01.729]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:22:02.069 --> 02:22:02.449]  January 12, 2010.
[02:22:02.529 --> 02:22:03.470]  Gold opened this morning at $1149.40.
[02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:06.711]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1180.55, $590.27 for a half-ounce, or $295.14 for the quarter-ounce.
[02:22:06.731 --> 02:22:07.252]  That's $1180.55, $590.27, or $295.14.
[02:22:18.957 --> 02:22:32.489]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[02:22:32.589 --> 02:22:41.216]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:41.416 --> 02:22:42.397]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:42.517 --> 02:22:46.641]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[02:22:46.861 --> 02:22:47.803]  Call for your copy.
[02:22:47.823 --> 02:22:47.883]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:47.943 --> 02:22:49.166]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[02:22:49.226 --> 02:22:49.527]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:49.607 --> 02:22:50.048]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:09.377 --> 02:23:09.777]  We're good to go.
[02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:31.050]  We're good to go!
[02:24:07.299 --> 02:24:10.542]  I was just shown a new Kay Bailey Hutchinson ad.
[02:24:10.762 --> 02:24:11.763]  She's running for governor.
[02:24:11.783 --> 02:24:13.525]  The senator is against Rick Perry.
[02:24:14.005 --> 02:24:16.908]  She's a Bilderberg Group member and steering committee member.
[02:24:16.968 --> 02:24:17.729]  Top globalist.
[02:24:19.050 --> 02:24:20.752]  Perry has just been an attendee.
[02:24:21.993 --> 02:24:22.773]  Perry's horrible.
[02:24:23.554 --> 02:24:28.899]  She's running an ad openly exposing that it is a UN takeover.
[02:24:36.357 --> 02:24:40.859]  And the fact is that once she gets in office, she'll continue with the toll roads, but she's desperate.
[02:24:40.919 --> 02:24:43.580]  She's losing right now, so she'll go ahead and tell the truth.
[02:24:44.580 --> 02:24:48.382]  So that's coming up, just an example of how these people operate.
[02:24:51.143 --> 02:24:55.125]  Also, there's another video clip we were sent last night that we didn't post.
[02:24:55.930 --> 02:24:58.751]  Because we were too busy and didn't get around to it.
[02:24:58.831 --> 02:25:01.331]  Plus it's... I don't know what I really think of the clip.
[02:25:01.692 --> 02:25:03.272]  I'll tell you about it at the end of the show.
[02:25:03.592 --> 02:25:06.233]  It'll be up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:25:06.253 --> 02:25:07.113]  It has been posted.
[02:25:07.133 --> 02:25:10.774]  I'm not going to tell you what it is until we discuss it.
[02:25:10.934 --> 02:25:14.395]  I'll show you the headline once it's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:25:14.435 --> 02:25:15.655]  Well, we have Aaron right here.
[02:25:15.935 --> 02:25:18.316]  Just have do give him the clip.
[02:25:19.338 --> 02:25:21.421]  I covered some of this in the first hour.
[02:25:35.174 --> 02:25:41.819]  But the bigger news issue is that on every front, people don't buy either political party now.
[02:25:42.340 --> 02:25:49.426]  They're finally shattering the left-right paradigm in a very, very big way.
[02:25:52.108 --> 02:25:54.350]  And the Democrats have now
[02:25:57.489 --> 02:26:00.050]  Seen the House and Senate versions that are in conference.
[02:26:00.130 --> 02:26:01.231]  Both are very bad.
[02:26:01.631 --> 02:26:08.695]  Jail time, five years in prison, quarter million dollar fines if you don't buy the insurance and they take money out of your check and they tax.
[02:26:09.095 --> 02:26:10.255]  Better insurance plans.
[02:26:10.295 --> 02:26:11.716]  You know they'll phase that into everything.
[02:26:12.056 --> 02:26:13.437]  Plus it's unconstitutional.
[02:26:13.957 --> 02:26:15.278]  It's discriminatory.
[02:26:16.439 --> 02:26:18.299]  Both versions of the bill and they're leaving it in.
[02:26:18.319 --> 02:26:18.800]  They're saying
[02:26:19.500 --> 02:26:20.861]  Leave certain states out.
[02:26:22.101 --> 02:26:24.823]  Leave scores of big labor unions out.
[02:26:24.883 --> 02:26:26.403]  Their employees don't have to do this.
[02:26:26.463 --> 02:26:27.464]  The rest of the public does.
[02:26:27.824 --> 02:26:35.068]  They become like little lords and little duchesses and little dukes and little kings, where it's all selectively done.
[02:26:35.108 --> 02:26:36.768]  We saw that with Obama.
[02:26:36.808 --> 02:26:41.151]  If you were a Democratic contributor, you got to keep your General Motors car dealership.
[02:26:41.231 --> 02:26:42.131]  If you weren't, you didn't.
[02:26:42.171 --> 02:26:43.592]  That came out on the House floor.
[02:26:44.494 --> 02:26:45.154]  That's public.
[02:26:46.075 --> 02:26:50.137]  If you're a globalist and contributed, he'd give you billions to move the factories overseas.
[02:26:51.298 --> 02:27:01.143]  And it's been like this with presidents before him the last few decades, but it's now coming to a head because they're going for broke and they don't care.
[02:27:01.943 --> 02:27:06.725]  And this bill raises taxes by at least $500 billion in the next 10 years.
[02:27:06.765 --> 02:27:07.506]  That's conservative.
[02:27:07.546 --> 02:27:09.487]  It's more like $700 billion they're reporting.
[02:27:11.117 --> 02:27:14.600]  41 billion Medicare cuts, 30-something billion Medicaid cuts every year.
[02:27:14.740 --> 02:27:16.662]  The taxes go up, the benefits go down.
[02:27:16.702 --> 02:27:21.546]  It gives immunity to the insurance companies and doctors and big HMOs to not give you care.
[02:27:21.986 --> 02:27:27.671]  So it has the government coming in with these panels of non-doctors deciding and setting policy for everyone.
[02:27:27.891 --> 02:27:28.892]  We've seen it in Canada.
[02:27:28.932 --> 02:27:32.355]  We've seen it in England, where you get rationed for health care.
[02:27:32.415 --> 02:27:33.896]  Tom Daschle wrote the original bill.
[02:27:33.916 --> 02:27:35.718]  He wrote a book calling for it.
[02:27:36.438 --> 02:27:37.839]  I mean, this is the reality.
[02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:39.401]  This legislation is bad.
[02:27:41.011 --> 02:27:44.093]  And, I mean, to say bad, that's not even a strong enough word.
[02:27:44.994 --> 02:27:50.377]  But then we have the Associated Press, where other labor unions that aren't exempted from it, they're getting angry.
[02:27:50.798 --> 02:27:57.062]  They were fine with something immoral for other people, other businesses, corporations, private companies, private individuals.
[02:27:58.102 --> 02:28:00.184]  But they don't like it that they're not exempt.
[02:28:03.010 --> 02:28:05.711]  Labor angry over Obama-backed insurance tax.
[02:28:06.212 --> 02:28:15.937]  Labor leaders are pushing hard on President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats to drop a proposed new tax on high-value health care plans, warning of politicians and political consequences.
[02:28:16.297 --> 02:28:22.400]  The White House has indicated the tax may change, show it hits fewer workers, but it's not going away.
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:26.122]  And then now we've confirmed in conference they're just going to exempt some people from it.
[02:28:27.301 --> 02:28:28.621]  Continuing, raw story.
[02:28:29.001 --> 02:28:32.822]  Dodd, health reform bill hanging by a thread.
[02:28:33.362 --> 02:28:39.224]  And he goes into saying the Democratic Party, people are exiting it, they're panicking, it may not even pass.
[02:28:39.364 --> 02:28:45.746]  But see, they did that foregone conclusion saying, oh, it will pass, no way to stop it, so you wouldn't lobby against it.
[02:28:45.786 --> 02:28:46.846]  But there's still time.
[02:28:47.486 --> 02:28:54.008]  The states also are saying they're going to fight it and it's unconstitutional because certain states don't have to do it, other states do, the feds can't do that.
[02:28:54.268 --> 02:28:55.528]  That's up for states to decide.
[02:28:57.108 --> 02:29:02.090]  But the interesting thing is, you read these Democrats on Raw Story, and what are they all saying?
[02:29:02.170 --> 02:29:05.531]  This morning there was 30-something comments, 36 comments when I printed this.
[02:29:05.831 --> 02:29:06.932]  I'm sure there's more now.
[02:29:07.312 --> 02:29:09.252]  But I read every comment and they all disagreed.
[02:29:10.173 --> 02:29:13.734]  It's not just liberals and labor unions, it's everybody with an ounce of sense.
[02:29:14.114 --> 02:29:19.936]  This bill is so bad, if anyone can cause the Democratic Party to lose control of what they call control of the House and Senate.
[02:29:22.857 --> 02:29:26.739]  And it goes, if the Democrats pass this love gift to the health insurance industry and the Senate,
[02:29:28.342 --> 02:29:29.923]  They will lose massively in 2010.
[02:29:31.504 --> 02:29:34.826]  I'm a lifelong liberal and will not tolerate this sellout to big insurance.
[02:29:35.187 --> 02:29:37.828]  And it's the same thing on every stinking comment.
[02:29:38.169 --> 02:29:39.670]  They've broken the paradigm.
[02:29:39.930 --> 02:29:44.153]  They get, all they're going to get from Washington is rape and robbery and pillaging.
[02:29:44.613 --> 02:29:47.675]  No matter what party or what they do, it's all a scam.
[02:29:47.695 --> 02:29:48.175]  Stay with us.
[02:29:49.736 --> 02:29:50.637]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.117 --> 02:29:52.738]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.659 --> 02:29:56.321]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.076 --> 02:30:05.918]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:30:06.058 --> 02:30:07.298]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:30:07.318 --> 02:30:07.999]  It's very real.
[02:30:08.139 --> 02:30:11.900]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[02:30:12.040 --> 02:30:16.361]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[02:30:16.501 --> 02:30:18.882]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.

[02:30:51.680 --> 02:30:58.246]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:31:00.948 --> 02:31:04.611]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:04.971 --> 02:31:07.973]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:08.214 --> 02:31:09.635]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:31:10.313 --> 02:31:12.974]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:12.994 --> 02:31:19.195]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:19.375 --> 02:31:24.416]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:31:24.577 --> 02:31:34.559]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:31:34.679 --> 02:31:36.781]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:31:37.021 --> 02:31:38.362]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:38.622 --> 02:31:40.884]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:41.085 --> 02:31:42.906]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:31:42.926 --> 02:31:47.971]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:48.351 --> 02:31:53.115]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:53.355 --> 02:31:57.459]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:32:00.211 --> 02:32:02.815]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:32:03.216 --> 02:32:08.203]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:32:08.564 --> 02:32:10.307]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:32:10.607 --> 02:32:15.094]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:32:18.101 --> 02:32:18.581]  We're good
[02:32:32.978 --> 02:32:33.358]  We're good.
[02:32:59.657 --> 02:32:59.918]  I think.
[02:33:22.395 --> 02:33:28.957]  Coming up in the last segment, I'm going to post at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com some amazing new video.
[02:33:29.297 --> 02:33:32.458]  We can't play it on air, the audio, but we can play the video.
[02:33:32.938 --> 02:33:34.839]  So that is coming up.
[02:33:35.799 --> 02:33:37.080]  So stay with us for that.
[02:33:38.513 --> 02:33:47.099]  They said they were going to post it on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and I've seen the link from Prison Planet Paul Watson sent me, but I can't see it in the tiles of the top stories.
[02:33:48.480 --> 02:33:52.863]  So we'll try to get it up on InfoWars.com as well.
[02:33:53.104 --> 02:33:55.826]  Instead of using IM, I'd use telephone with the guys.
[02:33:57.046 --> 02:33:59.088]  Try to get some confirmation from them.
[02:34:00.349 --> 02:34:02.090]  People texting people.
[02:34:04.155 --> 02:34:11.221]  There's a report where children, teenagers, only use 800 words a day now, when the average person uses tens of thousands.
[02:34:12.783 --> 02:34:15.826]  Children as young as three can't talk now in the U.S.
[02:34:15.866 --> 02:34:18.408]  and England from television and computers.
[02:34:19.088 --> 02:34:20.690]  And I've even caught it in my office now.
[02:34:20.730 --> 02:34:30.539]  Everyone just IMs and emails, and then stuff just falls through the cracks, where if people just pick up a telephone or talk face-to-face, there'd be clear communication on it.
[02:34:32.359 --> 02:34:33.601]  I'm not criticizing anybody.
[02:34:33.781 --> 02:34:39.729]  We also have a lot of remote people that work in other parts of England and New Mexico.
[02:34:41.812 --> 02:34:44.075]  Getting back to the news here.
[02:34:45.771 --> 02:34:53.658]  Dodd, health reform bill hanging by a thread and the Democrats are properly addressing this.
[02:34:53.698 --> 02:34:56.381]  That is the Democrat constituents, people calling themselves liberals.
[02:34:56.861 --> 02:35:02.967]  They're saying it's a health care takeover, a scam, a fraud, a looting, raising taxes and cutting benefits.
[02:35:03.367 --> 02:35:07.571]  But of course you never get something free when the government robs another group.
[02:35:07.691 --> 02:35:08.292]  They keep it.
[02:35:09.175 --> 02:35:10.275]  There is no free lunch.
[02:35:10.316 --> 02:35:10.936]  Don't you get it?
[02:35:11.176 --> 02:35:17.058]  Now, the right-wingers are attacking this from the wrong perspective, saying, it's commies that want to run our lives!
[02:35:17.719 --> 02:35:19.760]  Well, they want to run your lives, but they're not commies.
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:20.540]  They're big banks.
[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:31.625]  They're big insurance companies who can go write unconstitutional legislation to make you buy their overpriced insurance, or put you in prison if you don't, and then cut the quality of your care.
[02:35:33.171 --> 02:35:36.093]  So the left's got it part right, the right's got it partly right.
[02:35:36.854 --> 02:35:39.376]  Ladies and gentlemen, get out of your left-right paradigm.
[02:35:39.396 --> 02:35:53.088]  But the good news is, Senator Dodd, who says he's leaving the Senate, says on his way out the door, retiring Senator Chris Dodd, has some bad news for health reform advocates still cheering the late December Senate vote.
[02:35:53.608 --> 02:35:55.470]  Health reform is hanging by a thread.
[02:35:57.151 --> 02:36:05.895]  And one or two votes could determine the outcome of the heavily debated bill, Democrat Senator Chris Dodd told CNBC Monday.
[02:36:06.315 --> 02:36:24.322]  The Cable Business News Network reports, Dodd said, you would have to be living on the moon not to know that senators have already gone on record with having issues with the plan, citing Nebraska's Ben Nelson, Connecticut's Joe Lieberman, and Senator Blanche Lincoln from Arkansas, because they know it's political suicide to go for it.
[02:36:24.782 --> 02:36:31.005]  Everyone feels, I guess, to some degree, who have been for this, that we would have liked something different.
[02:36:31.806 --> 02:36:35.928]  And that it's not uncommon when you're considering an issue of this magnitude, he said.
[02:36:37.546 --> 02:36:41.968]  If this is all about surviving politically, then we're missing the whole purpose of what we're supposed to be doing.
[02:36:42.228 --> 02:36:43.248]  Yeah, destroying America.
[02:36:43.648 --> 02:36:47.149]  So the point is, they all know that people are wise now.
[02:36:47.390 --> 02:36:49.490]  That's why they tried to keep the bill secret, remember?
[02:36:49.710 --> 02:36:53.112]  That's why it's in secret conference committee now, what they're doing with it.
[02:36:53.512 --> 02:36:57.493]  Our supposed free society, the immigration bill three years ago was secret.
[02:36:57.533 --> 02:37:00.214]  We got it, total amnesty, even for felons.
[02:37:00.774 --> 02:37:02.615]  And they could bring in six of their family members.
[02:37:04.776 --> 02:37:05.496]  On and on and on.
[02:37:06.940 --> 02:37:08.081]  Everything is a fraud.
[02:37:08.161 --> 02:37:09.302]  No bid contracts.
[02:37:09.802 --> 02:37:14.205]  The media says, well, it should only be American companies that get the military contracts.
[02:37:14.926 --> 02:37:15.927]  That was a red herring.
[02:37:15.987 --> 02:37:17.628]  It was only American companies.
[02:37:17.908 --> 02:37:20.130]  It was no bid for other American companies.
[02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:22.572]  See, it's just, everything is spin and fraud.
[02:37:23.212 --> 02:37:35.101]  But the good news is, this giant lie is coming down on its head in a big way, and the people are finally getting it and finally understanding what's happening.
[02:37:36.354 --> 02:37:52.263]  On another issue of A Big Awakening that's taking place, we got the secret MIAC report and the Homeland Security report that listed gun owners, conservatives, returning veterans, libertarians, anti-Federal Reserve people as potential terrorists.
[02:37:53.203 --> 02:38:01.588]  There's a big article Paul Watson wrote today at PrisonPlanet.com, Obama's TSA nominee targets anti-government Christians.
[02:38:02.908 --> 02:38:05.430]  Targets anti-government Christians.
[02:38:06.986 --> 02:38:09.308]  And then it has the video clip of him saying it.
[02:38:10.128 --> 02:38:14.411]  And it's got him in his TSA uniform down at the bottom.
[02:38:14.431 --> 02:38:17.874]  I'm trying to pull that article up and see if we can.
[02:38:17.914 --> 02:38:20.676]  Obama's TSA nominee targets anti-government Christians.
[02:38:20.696 --> 02:38:25.299]  We can just show people the image of this guy before the show ends.
[02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:30.883]  And they are mixing in people that don't want bigger government, Christians.
[02:38:31.804 --> 02:38:37.629]  Just like Janet Reno told 60 Minutes, people who believe in a second coming of Christ are mentally ill cult members and terrorists.
[02:38:37.649 --> 02:38:39.471]  I mean, that's a quote.
[02:38:39.611 --> 02:38:40.912]  These people are the weirdos.
[02:38:40.972 --> 02:38:47.177]  These people are the ones that want to demonize freedom of religion and assembly in this country.
[02:38:47.197 --> 02:38:52.442]  And he says the main focus is on Christian conservatives.
[02:38:53.983 --> 02:38:58.187]  So, I mean, these guys are just right out in the open.
[02:38:59.406 --> 02:39:15.679]  Also, government documents have been released by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, EPIC, and Mike Adams at Natural News, we have this up on InfoWars.com, reports TSA lives exposed, full-body scanner machines do save and transmit images of your body, secret documents reveal.
[02:39:15.899 --> 02:39:16.659]  Well, of course!
[02:39:17.380 --> 02:39:19.421]  That's how the government's posting and sharing these.
[02:39:19.462 --> 02:39:20.702]  They say they record your body.
[02:39:20.943 --> 02:39:22.324]  They biometrically scan you.
[02:39:22.944 --> 02:39:26.507]  So I thought I would get into that.
[02:39:26.867 --> 02:39:28.769]  Also on the war front, a huge
[02:39:30.216 --> 02:39:40.002]  Provocation against Iran, who's already under sanctions, already had our government illegitimately overthrow their government several times, using radical Muslims to do it.
[02:39:40.862 --> 02:39:45.785]  General Petraeus goes on CNN and says, Iran can be bombed, says General Petraeus, and they may do it.
[02:39:46.166 --> 02:39:52.009]  That's not a general's place to be on CNN in a highly scripted show with Wolf Blitzer talking about that.
[02:39:52.049 --> 02:39:52.810]  It's outrageous!
[02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:59.734]  Alright, now getting into the banker bailout that's taking place.
[02:40:01.223 --> 02:40:02.184]  This is not a bailout.
[02:40:02.665 --> 02:40:04.007]  It is a banking takeover.
[02:40:04.468 --> 02:40:16.005]  And with BankerGate that we covered extensively yesterday and we wrote key articles on the sites about, I think the most comprehensive out there by Paul Watson, Steve Watson, and Curt Nemo, they all published reports yesterday, worked tirelessly.
[02:40:17.523 --> 02:40:19.945]  To go over all the facets of the criminality.
[02:40:19.985 --> 02:40:22.287]  We need to get those reports out to everybody.
[02:40:22.628 --> 02:40:25.230]  Ron Paul, Geithner should be fired over BankerGate.
[02:40:25.510 --> 02:40:26.811]  That's one by Paul Watson.
[02:40:27.412 --> 02:40:28.653]  Here's another one by Steve Watson.
[02:40:28.713 --> 02:40:32.997]  BankerGate emails expose criminal financial dictatorship at work.
[02:40:33.437 --> 02:40:36.440]  And again, Kurt filed another report with BankerGate in the title.
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:39.142]  You need to read and get out to everybody.
[02:40:39.703 --> 02:40:40.764]  This is so important.
[02:40:42.538 --> 02:40:56.863]  That people be made aware of this, because people know the banks are ripping them off, but they don't understand the full magnitude of crimes committed by Geithner and others on the surface, keeping it secret that they were being paid themselves, personally, the banker bailout money.
[02:40:57.103 --> 02:41:01.885]  The Federal Reserve people in the private group and the governmental Treasury Department.
[02:41:03.154 --> 02:41:04.977]  And here's what the mainstream media says.
[02:41:04.997 --> 02:41:06.240]  I mean, they admit what's happening.
[02:41:06.260 --> 02:41:09.125]  There's no longer any hiding it with over 20% real unemployment.
[02:41:09.606 --> 02:41:13.513]  America slides deeper into depression as Wall Street revels.
[02:41:14.014 --> 02:41:14.935]  That means parties.
[02:41:15.953 --> 02:41:17.355]  December was worst month for U.S.
[02:41:17.415 --> 02:41:19.457]  unemployment since the Great Depression began.
[02:41:19.598 --> 02:41:20.959]  London Guardian telling the truth.
[02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:22.101]  Business week.
[02:41:22.742 --> 02:41:24.464]  The disposable worker.
[02:41:25.305 --> 02:41:29.210]  Pay is falling, benefits are vanishing, and no one's job is secure.
[02:41:29.590 --> 02:41:34.697]  How companies are making the era of temp more than temporary.
[02:41:37.048 --> 02:41:41.051]  And it gets into how the real economy is dead as a doornail.
[02:41:41.272 --> 02:41:43.814]  But the banks say the economy's great because they're stealing all the money.
[02:41:44.174 --> 02:41:47.397]  Everything's being fed into their mouth, into their maw, into their jaws.
[02:41:47.817 --> 02:41:51.480]  Schwarzenegger budget acts would fall heavily on poor Reuters.
[02:41:51.900 --> 02:41:59.587]  See, they bankrupt California, now almost everything goes to interest on debt to private banks, and Schwarzenegger makes massive cuts to the poor.
[02:41:59.927 --> 02:42:05.754]  See, your whole beautiful welfare system that got everybody dependent, now they got Northcom and Homeland Security in place.
[02:42:06.034 --> 02:42:07.556]  They don't care if you riot now.
[02:42:07.616 --> 02:42:08.577]  They want you to riot.
[02:42:08.857 --> 02:42:10.219]  They're now going to bankrupt you.
[02:42:10.499 --> 02:42:15.064]  Then they're going to tax you if you have more than one child and pay you to be sterilized.
[02:42:15.325 --> 02:42:16.746]  That's what they're now openly announcing.
[02:42:16.766 --> 02:42:17.687]  They're pushing that now.
[02:42:17.947 --> 02:42:18.909]  That's the next phase.
[02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:22.761]  So over here on the document, Cam, I can show you a shot of this.
[02:42:22.781 --> 02:42:27.024]  Schwarzenegger budget acts would fall heavily on the poor.
[02:42:27.564 --> 02:42:37.990]  The latest budget plan from California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger would force 200,000 children off low-cost medical insurance, end in-home care for 350,000, end farm and elderly citizens.
[02:42:38.010 --> 02:42:38.971]  Yeah, I gotta euthanize them.
[02:42:39.431 --> 02:42:41.732]  And slash income assistance to hundreds of thousands more.
[02:42:42.012 --> 02:42:43.873]  And see, conservatives will say, oh, that sounds great.
[02:42:44.093 --> 02:42:44.834]  Yeah, but how about we cut
[02:42:45.354 --> 02:42:48.975]  No, that's growing, growing, growing, growing like a cancer.
[02:42:49.295 --> 02:42:56.318]  And don't forget the NBC report, not the one where TSA agents are going crazy declaring themselves God.
[02:42:56.718 --> 02:43:05.161]  No, the other one this week, where they're telling California employees at the DMV, and now they're saying other agencies, you've got to work one day a week free.
[02:43:05.621 --> 02:43:06.621]  That's called slavery.
[02:43:06.861 --> 02:43:09.042]  See, you government people love sucking off the public.
[02:43:09.222 --> 02:43:11.983]  You love your large S. That's all going to end for you too.
[02:43:14.141 --> 02:43:15.162]  We'll be just like China.
[02:43:15.202 --> 02:43:18.424]  Corrupt Chinese officials pocket $50 billion.
[02:43:18.864 --> 02:43:24.307]  The media is reporting $50 billion that the bureaucrats have stolen from the people.
[02:43:24.347 --> 02:43:26.008]  That's what big government delivers.
[02:43:26.248 --> 02:43:28.390]  Here's another one about what big government's doing to you.
[02:43:28.410 --> 02:43:30.171]  Copenhagen summit turned junket.
[02:43:30.611 --> 02:43:32.412]  Exclusive CBS News.
[02:43:32.672 --> 02:43:39.216]  At least 20 members of Congress made the trip to ClimateGate conference in Copenhagen last month and the millions and millions of dollars they spent to do it.
[02:43:40.933 --> 02:43:43.115]  Here's that other article that I mentioned.
[02:43:43.455 --> 02:43:46.158]  Teenagers only use 800 different words a day.
[02:43:47.059 --> 02:43:50.081]  Many children ages 3 can't even talk.
[02:43:50.602 --> 02:43:52.524]  We're being turned into just mindless drones.
[02:43:52.564 --> 02:43:55.987]  Pretty soon if you can talk and tie your shoelaces, you'll be known as a genius.
[02:43:56.007 --> 02:43:57.488]  Their brains are so filled with mercury.
[02:43:57.708 --> 02:44:00.110]  The government thinks you're so dumb they tell you mercury's good for you.
[02:44:01.151 --> 02:44:04.152]  Ed Brown receives virtual death sentence for resisting government.
[02:44:04.192 --> 02:44:05.873]  Curt Nemo, Infowars.com.
[02:44:06.213 --> 02:44:06.973]  All the details there.
[02:44:06.993 --> 02:44:08.273]  37 years in prison.
[02:44:09.114 --> 02:44:12.375]  He'd be over 107 years old when he gets out.
[02:44:12.635 --> 02:44:16.716]  He usually served 90 plus percent, about 92 percent of a federal sentence.
[02:44:16.996 --> 02:44:19.997]  So that means he'll be about 100 years old or more when he gets out.
[02:44:20.017 --> 02:44:21.217]  Just absolutely criminal.
[02:44:21.478 --> 02:44:23.558]  But meanwhile, Geithner doesn't have to pay his taxes.
[02:44:23.598 --> 02:44:28.800]  It can steal 220 something trillion billion in front of everybody.
[02:44:29.793 --> 02:44:34.656]  And doesn't get in trouble, but they get thrown in the slammer.
[02:44:36.758 --> 02:44:38.119]  So that is going on.
[02:44:43.362 --> 02:44:50.367]  Now continuing here, the media is trying to push distractions like Trent Lott, who was just...
[02:44:52.196 --> 02:44:52.756]  We're good to go.
[02:45:13.499 --> 02:45:16.340]  And it gets released in a big book that he said, oh, it's great.
[02:45:16.820 --> 02:45:22.582]  You know, Americans wouldn't vote for him, but he's light-skinned and doesn't have an ethnic dialect.
[02:45:23.122 --> 02:45:24.822]  He was pushing Obama to run.
[02:45:24.882 --> 02:45:25.963]  He's Obama's friend.
[02:45:26.303 --> 02:45:32.084]  He's saying what he thinks of as racist America will go for Obama.
[02:45:32.604 --> 02:45:34.185]  And it was Reid that got him to do it.
[02:45:35.199 --> 02:45:42.202]  But see, that's just a political football meant to train Republicans to support political correctness to rush in and call for his head.
[02:45:42.722 --> 02:45:45.003]  No, Lott shouldn't have to step down.
[02:45:45.323 --> 02:45:46.464]  He should step down because he's a crook.
[02:45:47.944 --> 02:45:49.185]  But not for that reason.
[02:45:49.385 --> 02:45:52.186]  And Reid shouldn't have to step down for that.
[02:45:52.206 --> 02:45:55.387]  He should step down because he's a crook violating Senate rules and the Constitution.
[02:45:55.647 --> 02:46:04.651]  But see, that's how they train you to accept political correctness in all of this is by having Republicans now enforce it on Harry Reid.
[02:46:06.775 --> 02:46:08.236]  So that's going on there.
[02:46:08.276 --> 02:46:11.578]  Republicans cite Lott in calling for Reid to quit.
[02:46:11.718 --> 02:46:18.322]  Now, the other big issue is what happened with Fluge.
[02:46:18.862 --> 02:46:19.703]  And it is Fluge.
[02:46:21.397 --> 02:46:24.660]  The head of the EU Health Council has admitted they were lied to.
[02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:26.261]  They were told tens of millions would die.
[02:46:26.281 --> 02:46:34.748]  It was all a fraud by big government for a power grab with pharmaceutical makers to make tens of billions of dollars with the big five makers.
[02:46:34.808 --> 02:46:35.509]  They lied.
[02:46:37.391 --> 02:46:40.233]  In these reports, the EU Health Chief, he'll get in trouble now.
[02:46:40.313 --> 02:46:40.593]  Watch.
[02:46:41.394 --> 02:46:46.077]  Since it's a dangerous vaccine, the German government wouldn't even take it themselves, remember that.
[02:46:46.657 --> 02:47:00.365]  Everything we told you about how it was a fraud, how it was a scam, how the vaccine was dangerous, how the government was quietly getting ready before April, before you heard anything about flu, to push this hype, we knew they were getting ready for that, so we warned the public.
[02:47:00.985 --> 02:47:09.071]  Everything we've said has now been completely proven for all these talk show hosts like Dr. Dina Dell that say the vaccine's safe and everybody needs to take it and it's not hype.
[02:47:09.452 --> 02:47:10.793]  That's been totally disproven.
[02:47:11.093 --> 02:47:17.057]  Everybody in your family who got in your face and said you better take it, give them the BBC reports, the Al Jazeera video reports.
[02:47:17.077 --> 02:47:20.420]  I'm going to play that at the start of the rebroadcast at the start of the show.
[02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:21.721]  We played that Al Jazeera report.
[02:47:22.041 --> 02:47:23.863]  The video's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:47:24.423 --> 02:47:30.248]  We have been proven absolutely correct, absolutely right on all of this.
[02:47:30.988 --> 02:47:32.689]  We know how the globalists operate.
[02:47:32.749 --> 02:47:34.470]  We know how their programs operate.
[02:47:34.530 --> 02:47:35.571]  We know what they do.
[02:47:35.891 --> 02:47:36.852]  We know their systems.
[02:47:36.932 --> 02:47:37.952]  We know their scams.
[02:47:38.493 --> 02:47:46.797]  And more and more people are listening to what we have to say and realizing that we've been telling people the truth all along and that we really know what we're talking about.
[02:47:46.857 --> 02:47:47.518]  Are we perfect?
[02:47:47.678 --> 02:47:47.878]  No.
[02:47:48.118 --> 02:47:48.919]  Do we make mistakes?
[02:47:49.119 --> 02:47:49.399]  Yes.
[02:47:49.939 --> 02:47:57.424]  But do we have the best handle on what's going on of any news websites or any radio show or any documentary filmmakers?
[02:47:58.084 --> 02:48:00.726]  We are the number one leaders of alternative news.
[02:48:01.046 --> 02:48:06.710]  Infowars.com is the biggest alternative news site on the web by Alexa and all the rating services.
[02:48:06.990 --> 02:48:08.592]  PrisonPlanet.com is number two.
[02:48:09.571 --> 02:48:10.812]  We have both the top spots.
[02:48:11.532 --> 02:48:16.436]  We are the leaders and the most successful viral video makers, period.
[02:48:16.936 --> 02:48:23.280]  Obama deception, conservatively over 20 million people watched it three months ago, and I checked the numbers, for free online.
[02:48:23.781 --> 02:48:27.603]  It's over 4 million that we know of with Follow the Republic free online.
[02:48:27.843 --> 02:48:32.026]  People have gotten the thousands of DVDs from us, made hundreds of thousands and millions of copies.
[02:48:32.687 --> 02:48:37.330]  One university, over 30,000 were handed out by the great folks at Freedoms Phoenix there.
[02:48:38.342 --> 02:48:40.683]  The point is, we are having a huge effect.
[02:48:40.964 --> 02:48:45.826]  And that's why Kay Bailey Hutchinson is running videos like the one we're about to play.
[02:48:46.387 --> 02:48:51.110]  And it just has text over traffic sounds, so I will narrate for radio listeners.
[02:48:51.590 --> 02:49:01.556]  She now is having to come out with an anti-New World Order piece about toll roads as a land grab to try to beat Perry when she's even more involved.
[02:49:01.576 --> 02:49:03.117]  And I'm not saying I'm going to vote for Perry either.
[02:49:03.197 --> 02:49:04.057]  Lesser of two evils.
[02:49:04.517 --> 02:49:05.118]  Or two evils.
[02:49:06.021 --> 02:49:11.263]  The point is, they are in total panic mode as all this information becomes mainstream.
[02:49:11.643 --> 02:49:17.426]  They're having to take on our political coloration of patriots and liberty people to try to win.
[02:49:18.206 --> 02:49:19.407]  And people are seeing through that.
[02:49:19.767 --> 02:49:23.968]  So, here is Bilderberg Group Steering Committee member, Kay Bailey Hutchinson's TV ad.
[02:49:34.073 --> 02:49:34.893]  It's a great ad.
[02:49:35.822 --> 02:49:47.933]  It's got images of those highway signs where they talk about it being a land grab, a foreign company, toll roads.
[02:49:48.654 --> 02:49:50.395]  It's time to end the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:49:51.136 --> 02:49:55.159]  And see, they said last year, oh we've canceled it, but they're continuing the whole thing.
[02:49:55.179 --> 02:49:57.862]  They're just not calling it Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:49:58.082 --> 02:50:00.664]  The AP had the headline saying
[02:50:01.405 --> 02:50:07.429]  That, oh, it's been cancelled, but then saying three paragraphs later, oh, but Rick Perry's renaming it something else.
[02:50:07.649 --> 02:50:08.450]  Play the video again.
[02:50:08.490 --> 02:50:11.432]  I want to try to read as much of that as I can for radio listeners.
[02:50:14.174 --> 02:50:16.135]  This is a free road.
[02:50:16.856 --> 02:50:17.436]  For now.
[02:50:18.997 --> 02:50:21.099]  Rick Perry wants it to be a toll road.
[02:50:22.459 --> 02:50:24.141]  The road your taxes already paid for.
[02:50:25.248 --> 02:50:27.209]  A giant Perry land grab.
[02:50:27.969 --> 02:50:30.730]  Like the 600,000 acres he tried to take from Texans.
[02:50:31.530 --> 02:50:34.271]  So a foreign company could charge tolls too.
[02:50:35.752 --> 02:50:37.712]  It's time to end the trans-Texas corridor.
[02:50:38.633 --> 02:50:40.073]  Paid for by Kay Bailey Hutchinson.
[02:50:40.293 --> 02:50:43.054]  But she doesn't tell you she works for the very same globalist.
[02:50:43.314 --> 02:50:45.595]  She doesn't tell you she's been involved in this whole program.
[02:50:45.835 --> 02:50:50.917]  She doesn't tell you it's a larger nationwide land grab under the NAFTA superhighway system.
[02:50:51.820 --> 02:50:54.601]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the key video.
[02:50:54.621 --> 02:50:58.962]  Stay with us.
[02:50:59.583 --> 02:51:02.844]  America is in deep, deep trouble because we don't know our rights.
[02:51:03.164 --> 02:51:09.386]  Let's get real freedom back into America by teaching and promoting the Bill of Rights with the 2010 Freedom Calendar.
[02:51:09.626 --> 02:51:09.886]  Why?
[02:51:10.086 --> 02:51:11.947]  Because our forefathers gave them to us.
[02:51:12.127 --> 02:51:15.128]  Because the Freedom Calendar is true patriotism in action.
[02:51:15.428 --> 02:51:19.631]  And because if you don't know your rights and use them, you may lose them.
[02:51:19.851 --> 02:51:23.294]  The Freedom Calendar is the best educational tool in over 200 years.
[02:51:23.514 --> 02:51:29.098]  It shows in detail how to use your rights, how to answer any bureaucrat, how to use your guaranteed rights for true freedom.
[02:51:29.258 --> 02:51:36.223]  The Freedom Calendar is the easy way to learn the proper use and function of each of our rights, and is perfect for homeschoolers, business promotions,
[02:51:36.323 --> 02:51:36.643]  I think so.
[02:52:00.695 --> 02:52:04.345]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:04.706 --> 02:52:07.714]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:07.955 --> 02:52:09.378]  Is it finishing off this agenda?
[02:52:10.077 --> 02:52:12.718]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:12.738 --> 02:52:18.960]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:19.120 --> 02:52:24.162]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:24.322 --> 02:52:34.286]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:34.426 --> 02:52:36.527]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:36.768 --> 02:52:38.088]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:38.369 --> 02:52:40.690]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:40.810 --> 02:52:42.652]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:42.952 --> 02:52:47.695]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:48.095 --> 02:52:52.858]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:53.098 --> 02:52:57.201]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:01.420 --> 02:53:02.560]  This is not a drill.
[02:53:02.640 --> 02:53:04.641]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:53:05.141 --> 02:53:06.761]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:53:07.041 --> 02:53:14.183]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:53:14.263 --> 02:53:18.624]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:53:18.664 --> 02:53:21.205]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques.
[02:53:21.285 --> 02:53:24.066]  Where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them.
[02:53:24.106 --> 02:53:25.486]  How to create the perfect hiding
[02:53:25.486 --> 02:53:25.846]  We're good.
[02:53:46.937 --> 02:53:49.439]  That's hideyourguns.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:53:49.459 --> 02:53:52.541]  Before they come for your guns, hideyourguns.com right now!
[02:54:04.298 --> 02:54:10.983]  Okay, one of our listeners on the 8th sent us the raw video of this as a link.
[02:54:11.104 --> 02:54:11.904]  It was on the web.
[02:54:12.825 --> 02:54:19.510]  My crew is so overworked and distracted, they didn't bring it to my attention to this morning when it went on YouTube.
[02:54:20.411 --> 02:54:23.654]  But we are going to get the guy that confronted him on the show tomorrow.
[02:54:25.035 --> 02:54:27.216]  But it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:27.877 --> 02:54:30.499]  F you angry man swears at George H.W.
[02:54:30.539 --> 02:54:32.741]  Bush at Houston Restaurant.
[02:54:35.092 --> 02:54:42.375]  And my issue is, this shows the boldness of the people, and it is H.W.
[02:54:42.415 --> 02:54:42.756]  Bush.
[02:54:42.776 --> 02:54:45.317]  We're going to show you a still shot here of him.
[02:54:45.337 --> 02:54:49.399]  But if you go to PrisonPlanet.com, this just went up a few hours ago, we have it.
[02:54:50.559 --> 02:54:52.420]  And it's also up on InfoWars.com.
[02:54:52.460 --> 02:54:54.401]  The article is, F.U.
[02:54:54.481 --> 02:54:56.362]  Angry Man Swears at George H.W.
[02:54:56.402 --> 02:54:56.662]  Bush.
[02:54:57.322 --> 02:55:01.224]  And without the audio, we'll play some of this video at a pizza place.
[02:55:02.588 --> 02:55:05.230]  And I want to warn this guy when he gets on the show with us.
[02:55:05.990 --> 02:55:08.772]  The Bushes don't usually have you taken out.
[02:55:09.973 --> 02:55:11.694]  Unless you personally get in their face.
[02:55:13.115 --> 02:55:21.601]  And I've done it to George W. Bush, and he had me arrested, my arm almost ripped off by the police, for simply at a press conference asking him a question about the New World Order.
[02:55:22.742 --> 02:55:27.726]  And so this guy has, there he is in the green, in the green over there.
[02:55:28.846 --> 02:55:29.267]  That's the
[02:55:31.547 --> 02:55:33.008]  What, was that Bush 42?
[02:55:35.089 --> 02:55:35.830]  Because Clinton was 40?
[02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:37.811]  No, no, that'd be Bush 41.
[02:55:38.572 --> 02:55:43.875]  Bush 41, then it was Clinton, then it was Bush, then it was Obama.
[02:55:43.995 --> 02:55:44.356]  Obama's 44.
[02:55:44.396 --> 02:55:46.557]  So that'd be Bush 41.
[02:55:47.618 --> 02:55:57.925]  And, uh... So George Bush Sr., in a little pizza place, wanting to get some pizza, being confronted, and the guy confronts him about all the wars he launched, all the people,
[02:55:59.224 --> 02:56:00.485]  That his New World Order is killed.
[02:56:00.505 --> 02:56:06.367]  And that's why the globalists want this cashless society control grid in place.
[02:56:07.407 --> 02:56:16.811]  They want this cashless society control grid in place because they want to be able to track, control everybody so they can carry out their crimes against humanity.
[02:56:17.131 --> 02:56:19.832]  And so the slaves can't even speak up against them.
[02:56:19.852 --> 02:56:25.695]  But we're going to call this fella that sent us this, I guess, four or five days ago.
[02:56:27.435 --> 02:56:31.277]  And get him get him on the show with us in the next few days.
[02:56:31.777 --> 02:56:34.399]  We have Tyrell Ventura on tomorrow.
[02:56:34.899 --> 02:56:38.761]  We have Catherine Austin Fitz on Bankstergate or Bankergate.
[02:56:38.841 --> 02:56:39.642]  Choose your poison.
[02:56:40.142 --> 02:56:42.583]  She'll be on with us tomorrow and throughout the week.
[02:56:42.723 --> 02:56:44.024]  Very informative guest.
[02:56:45.225 --> 02:56:45.605]  I kind of
[02:56:47.995 --> 02:56:50.496]  Spun out with all this news here towards the end of the show.
[02:56:51.396 --> 02:56:53.717]  There's just so much happening, so much going on.
[02:56:53.737 --> 02:56:58.859]  I want to commend the crew for the great job that they have been doing.
[02:56:58.899 --> 02:57:07.843]  I want to commend all the AM and FM affiliates, Shortwave, Satellite, Internet, our IT people, our back office, the sales guys, everybody that makes this radio show possible.
[02:57:10.288 --> 02:57:18.854]  And I want to invite you to tune in at the very start of the show and the rebroadcast on the internet streams at InfoWars.com if you want to hear that and see that Al Jazeera piece.
[02:57:19.394 --> 02:57:23.297]  But it's BBC2 openly exposing the fraud of the flu shots.
[02:57:23.717 --> 02:57:34.205]  Any of you who were doubting this was all a made-up fraud, it's now come out that it's a made-up fraud from the highest levels of the EU, that the UN, World Health Organization did this.
[02:57:35.945 --> 02:57:38.366]  Also, another activist tool isn't just my films.
