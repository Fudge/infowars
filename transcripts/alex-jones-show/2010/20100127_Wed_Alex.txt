[00:00:05.493 --> 00:00:10.515]  After ClimateGate, PachariGate, GlacierGate, AmazonGate, and you've got
[00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:38.533]  Racketeering Globally, that document came out two months ago with the U.N.
[00:00:38.953 --> 00:00:42.035]  building and organizing key universities to engage in fraud.
[00:00:42.436 --> 00:00:47.099]  We go look at each university, Canada, Australia, the U.S., New Zealand, England.
[00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:55.546]  They are all cooking the books, cutting out temperature data that shows that we're cooling in the last 10 years at least.
[00:00:56.046 --> 00:00:58.868]  The heating ended 15 years ago.
[00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.710]  You've got Pachari making all this money.
[00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:16.788]  This is unprecedented because the entire globalist agenda for the UN-IMF World Bank to set up world taxation and to be able to shut down or curtail any industry that isn't part of their inside coterie, it's all imploding.
[00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:20.012]  But the battle isn't over.
[00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:21.173]  We've won a lot of big battles.
[00:01:21.273 --> 00:01:22.555]  We've now got the initiative.
[00:01:23.564 --> 00:01:26.386]  We can beat them, but they're ensconced, they're dug in.
[00:01:26.826 --> 00:01:30.168]  We're going to have to go house to house with these people in our towns, our cities.
[00:01:30.228 --> 00:01:33.890]  Schwarzeneggers organizing governors and mayors to take over locally.
[00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.892]  Absolute treason, and he needs to go back to his own country.
[00:01:36.912 --> 00:01:39.333]  They'll sure kick him out in Austria.
[00:01:39.393 --> 00:01:44.176]  James Dillingpole writes regularly for the Times of London, the Sunday Times, the Daily Telegraph.
[00:01:44.516 --> 00:01:45.537]  He's also a TV critic.
[00:01:45.857 --> 00:01:48.499]  The Spectator, he is the author of various novels, including
[00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:50.832]  And we'll tell you about some of those.
[00:01:50.952 --> 00:01:55.415]  Also, he's a best-selling author and one of the great analysts.
[00:01:56.396 --> 00:01:59.598]  Breaking down what these people are up to.
[00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:00.939]  We'll also give you his website.
[00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:13.548]  This is a short segment, but James, is it safe to say, or let me ask you this question, is this exploding in their face in an even bigger fashion than you thought ClimateGate would originally?
[00:02:14.212 --> 00:02:14.713]  Definitely.
[00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:17.636]  I thought Christmas had come early with Climategate.
[00:02:18.016 --> 00:02:21.881]  It seems that next Christmas has come early as well, because this has been fantastic.
[00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:25.966]  We are having so many scandals, I almost can't keep up with it.
[00:02:27.212 --> 00:02:27.893]  That's the good news.
[00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:33.217]  The bad news is, as Shakespeare said, we have scotched the snake but not killed it.
[00:02:33.397 --> 00:02:34.098]  And that's the problem.
[00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:42.244]  The snake, I think, the great AGW, anthropogenic global warming snake, is much more dangerous now it's wounded.
[00:02:42.264 --> 00:02:53.413]  I think you're going to see all sorts of devious attempts by the IPCC, by the various green movements, to try and trick their way out of the situation.
[00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:54.794]  And we've got to be on our guard.
[00:02:56.141 --> 00:03:06.905]  They've gone from stonewalling to now the BBC, The Age and others going, oh, there were a few bad scientists that meant well because they know how real the problem is.
[00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:14.448]  And we now see the IPCC head and others saying, well, we did want to make it look worse because it is a real problem.
[00:03:14.488 --> 00:03:17.189]  So now they're saying we lied to save you.
[00:03:17.757 --> 00:03:18.977]  Well, it's interesting, Alex.
[00:03:19.137 --> 00:03:24.818]  Are your listeners familiar with Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, the guy in charge, the beardy guy?
[00:03:24.878 --> 00:03:27.959]  He looks a bit like... I call him the troll impersonator.
[00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.779]  He looks a bit like Saruman from Lord of the Rings.
[00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.980]  Well, he looks like Osama Bin Laden's older brother.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.220]  He does, he does!
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.441]  His ugly older brother.
[00:03:37.761 --> 00:03:38.821]  Yeah, that's the guy.
[00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:45.142]  Well, Dr. Pachauri's in charge of the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on
[00:03:45.282 --> 00:03:45.983]  Climate change.
[00:03:46.603 --> 00:03:56.393]  And as you know, he's been exposed for having all sorts of extraordinarily diverse business connections.
[00:03:56.453 --> 00:03:58.735]  He's heavily involved in carbon trading.
[00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:05.762]  He's even got an involvement in an oil company, which is kind of weird, given that he's supposed to be saving the planet from big oil.
[00:04:06.302 --> 00:04:09.986]  Anyway, he's in it up to the neck in carbon trading, which is a kind of
[00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:15.610]  I think the most polite way of putting it is he has certain conflicts of interest.
[00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:16.571]  Okay.
[00:04:17.532 --> 00:04:19.814]  So this has been going on for quite some time.
[00:04:19.854 --> 00:04:22.856]  He's been exposed by us gallant bloggers.
[00:04:23.416 --> 00:04:29.421]  And who are the guys calling most loudly for his resignation?
[00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:34.746]  Why, funnily enough, they are the environmentalists.
[00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:35.586]  Stay there, James.
[00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:39.529]  James Dillingpold, a top writer over in England, author, researcher.
[00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.351]  Somebody's really been tracking this fraud.
[00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:43.692]  Long segment coming up.
[00:04:43.752 --> 00:04:47.594]  I want to just go through all the new scandals one by one.
[00:04:47.735 --> 00:04:50.236]  Each one dwarfing Climategate.
[00:04:50.576 --> 00:04:51.817]  Each one more wild.
[00:04:51.857 --> 00:04:52.477]  And you said it.
[00:04:52.798 --> 00:04:54.559]  It's five or six new scandals a day.
[00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.781]  I can't even keep track of it, but we're gonna try here today.
[00:04:57.841 --> 00:04:58.241]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.109 --> 00:05:02.090]  What's your home worth?
[00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:04.213]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:05:04.373 --> 00:05:07.137]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:05:07.417 --> 00:05:14.947]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[00:05:15.147 --> 00:05:18.592]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:07.371]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:09.452]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:06:09.592 --> 00:06:11.713]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:13.334]  And it's available right now to you.

[00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.231]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.493]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.813 --> 00:07:05.413]  Number one.
[00:07:05.733 --> 00:07:08.875]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:09.156 --> 00:07:09.716]  Number two.
[00:07:10.016 --> 00:07:14.559]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:15.359]  It's true.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.222]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:21.043]  Number three.
[00:07:21.323 --> 00:07:24.605]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.906 --> 00:07:29.389]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:31.991]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:36.614]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:36.854 --> 00:07:40.797]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:41.017 --> 00:07:45.781]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:46.061 --> 00:07:50.082]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:50.222 --> 00:07:51.782]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:52.002 --> 00:07:54.103]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:54.263 --> 00:07:56.863]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:56.883 --> 00:08:04.305]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.325 --> 00:08:07.885]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.346 --> 00:08:13.446]  We have the best-selling author of Obama Land.
[00:08:13.487 --> 00:08:15.347]  I've seen the future and it doesn't work.
[00:08:16.587 --> 00:08:19.428]  Journalist, Mr. Dillingpole, with us.
[00:08:19.468 --> 00:08:22.229]  His website is jamesdillingpole.com.
[00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.430]  And he's with us for the rest of the hour.
[00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:29.692]  Now, if you just joined us, we're going to chronicle the aftermath of Climategate.
[00:08:30.973 --> 00:08:40.977]  And it's kind of like a battle at sea, where you torpedo a big ship, and it starts exploding and burning, but then the magazine
[00:08:42.011 --> 00:08:49.217]  Where all of its explosives and artillery shells are stored, ignites, and the whole ship just blows up.
[00:08:49.937 --> 00:08:51.839]  Now, they're still in our local towns and cities.
[00:08:51.879 --> 00:08:53.240]  They've invested hundreds of billions.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.501]  They're not going to stop.
[00:08:54.641 --> 00:08:59.845]  But their capital ship, their main flagship, has completely exploded.
[00:09:00.145 --> 00:09:01.406]  They are now known as frauds.
[00:09:01.887 --> 00:09:02.507]  But they don't care.
[00:09:02.527 --> 00:09:03.528]  They're going to continue on.
[00:09:04.088 --> 00:09:06.110]  So we're going through the U.N.
[00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:06.931]  climate chief.
[00:09:08.051 --> 00:09:17.355]  Who is admitting all these errors in their reports, but it's coming out that they quote, did want to make it look worse, so that we would accept them saving us.
[00:09:17.395 --> 00:09:31.001]  And of course he makes money off shutting down ancient, and when I say ancient, some of the oldest and best steel mills, forges in England, and the government pays him to then set one up in India.
[00:09:31.721 --> 00:09:34.004]  So, this is also a hijacking of industry.
[00:09:34.284 --> 00:09:40.491]  We're covering that scandal first, then we're going to get into all the other scandals with Mr. Dillingpole.
[00:09:40.751 --> 00:09:41.512]  Please continue, sir.
[00:09:43.027 --> 00:10:04.914]  We've got Dr Pachauri, here is the bearded troll impersonator we talked about earlier, and this guy is in charge of the UN body responsible for telling the world that the world is getting dangerously hotter, it's all man's fault, we must spend lots and lots of money, we must increase regulation, we must have carbon credits,
[00:10:05.374 --> 00:10:06.354]  We're good to go!
[00:10:30.643 --> 00:10:31.123]  Yes, I think so.
[00:10:52.270 --> 00:11:10.117]  That the United Nations, the IPCC's fourth assessment report, supposed to be the most accurate, up-to-date, most scientifically reliable report on the state of the planet, climate-wise, tells us
[00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:11.458]  Yes, we are.
[00:11:28.251 --> 00:11:28.431]  I think.
[00:11:47.696 --> 00:12:03.882]  And how did the IPCC, which is supposed to be the work of, what is it, 2,000 expert scientists in their field, 2,500 peer-reviewed scientists, we're told, how come this mistake got slipped into this reliable report?
[00:12:04.362 --> 00:12:10.664]  Well, it turns out that the IPCC plays pretty fast and loose with its scientific fact.
[00:12:11.985 --> 00:12:16.770]  It got this from a magazine article in New Scientist.
[00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.975]  Where did New Scientist get this information from about the glaciers melting by 2035?
[00:12:22.195 --> 00:12:32.345]  It got this information from a conversation on a mobile phone with an Indian chap who has since admitted that he made a terrible mistake.
[00:12:32.745 --> 00:12:37.950]  Now, it's funny, isn't it, that the IPCC never bothered to check up on this mistake.
[00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.214]  This is the reliable, they keep using this word, robust.
[00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:45.497]  The IPCC peer-reviewed process is robust.
[00:12:45.537 --> 00:12:47.799]  Well, I'm sorry, but this is anything but robust.
[00:12:47.819 --> 00:12:50.842]  This is climate fraud.
[00:12:52.083 --> 00:12:57.589]  Now, James Dillingpole investigating this for major publications in England and the United States.
[00:12:59.386 --> 00:13:03.229]  We know that when they have this mantra of, but it's peer-reviewed.
[00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.311]  It's peer-reviewed.
[00:13:05.932 --> 00:13:13.178]  Ignore ClimateGate and one of the main climate facilities used by the UN at East Anglia, England.
[00:13:14.219 --> 00:13:16.842]  Ignore the fact that they are trying to hide decline.
[00:13:17.262 --> 00:13:22.507]  We have all these other scientists all peer-reviewed, but when you look at it, they are all using the data
[00:13:23.207 --> 00:13:23.547]  I think?
[00:13:42.234 --> 00:13:44.939]  And their peer-reviewed journals are somebody on a cell phone!
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:51.071]  I mean, you can just call into the UN and say, Martians are going to land if we don't put taxes on gasoline.
[00:13:51.111 --> 00:13:51.692]  Oh, that's it!
[00:13:51.992 --> 00:13:52.573]  Peer-reviewed!
[00:13:52.613 --> 00:13:53.114]  Put it in there!
[00:13:54.861 --> 00:13:55.522]  That's absolutely right.
[00:13:55.542 --> 00:14:00.426]  I think whenever you hear somebody use the phrase peer-reviewed, you should reach for your Browning.
[00:14:00.907 --> 00:14:08.755]  Because peer-reviewed, I'm sorry to say, is a bankrupt notion since Climategate.
[00:14:08.795 --> 00:14:17.223]  Because what the Climategate emails from the University of East Anglia showed, quite clearly, was that the scientists at the heart of this process
[00:14:17.943 --> 00:14:18.984]  We're good to go.
[00:14:43.084 --> 00:14:45.666]  But in the new science, you're not allowed to question Al Gore.
[00:14:45.706 --> 00:14:46.707]  He says it's settled.
[00:14:47.268 --> 00:14:48.569]  That's the end of it.
[00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:50.751]  But isn't it worse, sir?
[00:14:51.191 --> 00:15:00.119]  Because they're not just only allowing a small inner group to produce these fake studies that have been proven to all be absolute fraud.
[00:15:00.579 --> 00:15:02.941]  They will never release the data.
[00:15:03.382 --> 00:15:08.005]  And now, because the data is being forced to be released, we find out when you actually go to Russia,
[00:15:08.746 --> 00:15:18.973]  Or go to China, or go to the United States, or go to South America, that the numbers they use from the temperature measurements are absolute frauds every time you spot check.
[00:15:19.273 --> 00:15:27.078]  I mean, this needs to be fully audited, but again, the UN and all the major governments are behind this, so how do you let the crooks audit themselves?
[00:15:27.458 --> 00:15:28.099]  Well, I know.
[00:15:28.119 --> 00:15:38.946]  I mean, Alex, have you seen the fantastic report released today by Joseph DeLeo, who's a meteorologist, and Anthony Watts of the famous What's Up With That website?
[00:15:38.966 --> 00:15:40.327]  It's fantastic.
[00:15:40.707 --> 00:15:45.491]  It says, surface temperature records, policy-driven deception.
[00:15:47.290 --> 00:16:05.320]  This very thorough report is that the surface data records from the last century or so are so corrupt and unreliable that we cannot even be sure that any global warming whatsoever has taken place in the last century or so.
[00:16:05.779 --> 00:16:07.020]  And they've got a lot of tricks, too.
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:31.171]  All over the world, this is on record now, we posted the mainstream articles where they admit it, in the last 20 years, these funded groups have set up their own reading systems, or they have contracted with airports, or they've contracted with weather centers on top of buildings, where they know the temperature is going to be many degrees hotter, and that's another way.
[00:16:32.112 --> 00:16:34.493]  It's called the Urban Heat Island Effect.
[00:16:35.554 --> 00:16:58.643]  What this means is that the weather sites where temperatures have been measured around the world, originally they were built maybe on the edge of town, and as civilization, as cities have grown in size, so the area surrounding the weather gauge has become more and more built up.
[00:16:59.043 --> 00:17:00.904]  Some of these things are sited near airports.
[00:17:01.204 --> 00:17:15.110]  So what this means is that, inevitably, the temperature records they're keeping have been distorted by the urban heat island effect of the cities, because cities are warmer than the country outside.
[00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.150]  That's how it works.
[00:17:16.811 --> 00:17:27.975]  So how are we to trust these records which show that the Earth is getting warmer, when it may simply be the result of the urban heat island effect?
[00:17:28.335 --> 00:17:29.436]  But that's not all.
[00:17:30.465 --> 00:17:47.134]  What happened sometime between the 1970s and the 1990s is that they vastly reduced the number of weather stations used to compile the world's temperature data records.
[00:17:49.155 --> 00:17:59.021]  And what they generally did, these organisations like NASA and the Climatic Research Unit, was that they cherry-picked
[00:17:59.531 --> 00:18:00.212]  I don't know.
[00:18:13.882 --> 00:18:17.484]  The world was getting warmer, and then kind of took an average.
[00:18:17.864 --> 00:18:31.572]  Now, inevitably what happened is that you saw this upward tick in the graph, which is exactly what they want, because an upward tick in the graph shows that the world is getting warmer, it must be man-made, and action must be taken.
[00:18:31.994 --> 00:18:37.057]  But the Russians and others came out and exposed that, and they've now been forced to admit that they did indeed do that.
[00:18:37.577 --> 00:18:45.442]  They would just take the warmer southern areas and create an average for the entire country for the frozen north as well.
[00:18:45.502 --> 00:18:53.107]  The frozen northern areas of Russia, Siberia and many other areas, of course they're a lot colder than southern Russia.
[00:18:53.407 --> 00:19:00.811]  I mean, this is bona fide fraud, and what ClimateGate proves is they're all coordinating with each other to engage in fraud.
[00:19:01.812 --> 00:19:06.354]  It is, I have to say, a conspiracy on a very, very large scale.
[00:19:06.835 --> 00:19:16.480]  And it unites some oddly disparate groups, because on the one hand you've got the yoghurt-weaving eco-loons, you know, the green activists,
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:38.889]  Who have found themselves in this weird, unholy alliance with big oil, big banks, Rothschilds, Goldman Sachs, in alliance with the technocrats of the European Union, in alliance with scientists at various government funded institutions.
[00:19:39.289 --> 00:19:44.871]  It's a very strange and broad coalition campaigning for this.
[00:19:45.371 --> 00:19:47.452]  Well, the communists always work for the banks.
[00:19:47.872 --> 00:19:50.873]  In every case, we find that, because the big banks don't want freedom.
[00:19:51.293 --> 00:19:56.075]  In many cases, they want monopolies, and a gang of machine-gun-toting hippies can deliver it.
[00:19:56.395 --> 00:19:58.256]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[00:19:58.296 --> 00:19:58.776]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.587 --> 00:20:05.849]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:21:01.457 --> 00:21:02.297]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:21:02.477 --> 00:21:07.818]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:08.439]  I get it.
[00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:17.921]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:21:18.181 --> 00:21:19.361]  That's not what's happening.
[00:21:19.581 --> 00:21:23.962]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:25.863]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[00:21:26.023 --> 00:21:27.844]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:21:28.044 --> 00:21:31.326]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:21:31.446 --> 00:21:35.548]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:21:35.709 --> 00:21:37.289]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:40.551]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:21:41.272 --> 00:21:44.914]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:21:45.094 --> 00:21:45.814]  You should, too.
[00:21:45.994 --> 00:21:46.975]  Find out what they know.
[00:21:47.155 --> 00:21:50.397]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.

[00:21:50.717 --> 00:21:50.757]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.777 --> 00:21:50.977]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.997 --> 00:21:53.559]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:53.599 --> 00:21:55.240]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.761]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:22:11.491 --> 00:22:14.152]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:22:14.172 --> 00:22:20.375]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:22:20.555 --> 00:22:25.597]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:22:25.737 --> 00:22:35.742]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:22:35.842 --> 00:22:37.964]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:22:38.204 --> 00:22:39.525]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:22:39.785 --> 00:22:42.067]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:22:42.247 --> 00:22:44.088]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:22:44.368 --> 00:22:49.192]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:22:49.512 --> 00:22:54.316]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:03.830]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.030]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:06.910]  Don't!
[00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:10.371]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:23:10.791 --> 00:23:17.913]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:23:17.893 --> 00:23:19.553]  's number one debt secret.
[00:23:19.873 --> 00:23:23.554]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.

[00:23:34.462 --> 00:23:35.463]  Herb K was right.
[00:23:35.663 --> 00:23:38.725]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:23:38.825 --> 00:23:39.846]  What have you got to lose?
[00:23:40.186 --> 00:23:43.329]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.

[00:23:48.695 --> 00:23:48.735]  888-352-7726.
[00:24:05.225 --> 00:24:18.778]  James Dillingpole.com, that's his website, best-selling author on Obamaland with us for the rest of the hour as we chronicle all of the fraud coming out and the fact that they're now capitulating
[00:24:20.185 --> 00:24:22.548]  Because they know the stonewalling has backfired on them.
[00:24:22.568 --> 00:24:32.220]  Now they're saying, yes, we did make it more severe than it is to convince you that you need to be saved by us, but it still is bad.
[00:24:33.021 --> 00:24:36.865]  And I've got quote after quote where they're basically saying that.
[00:24:38.247 --> 00:24:41.331]  Uh, and it's coming out that Al Gore is making all this money.
[00:24:41.371 --> 00:24:44.254]  The Rothschilds own one of the big carbon trading scams.
[00:24:44.715 --> 00:24:46.637]  Pacharis hooked up with all of them.
[00:24:47.198 --> 00:24:56.248]  Another IPCC scientist reveals how a UN scientist talked about trying to make the IPCC report so dramatic that the US would just have to sign
[00:24:56.889 --> 00:24:57.850]  That's right.
[00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.013]  Yeah, I think what you're going to see happening next, Alex, is that
[00:25:16.212 --> 00:25:26.465]  There's going to be a period of retrenchment where all the wall-mists suddenly say, OK, hands up, you know, we admit there may have been a few mistakes.
[00:25:26.866 --> 00:25:27.827]  And you know what they're going to do next?
[00:25:28.207 --> 00:25:31.512]  They will chuck Pichauri off the back of the sledge to the walls.
[00:25:32.205 --> 00:25:34.166]  Same thing on Bankergate with Geithner and Bernanke.
[00:25:34.367 --> 00:25:37.649]  There's no way they're getting out of this now.
[00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:39.110]  That's what I mean.
[00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.672]  Chunking them overboard isn't going to be enough.
[00:25:41.692 --> 00:25:43.173]  I mean, people are really starting to get it.
[00:26:00.839 --> 00:26:05.041]  Yeah, you know, Alex, I think something incredible is going on right now.
[00:26:05.081 --> 00:26:08.043]  I mean, I really feel like we're part of a really exciting movement.
[00:26:08.083 --> 00:26:09.584]  We are storming the Bastille.
[00:26:10.745 --> 00:26:12.566]  The Berlin Wall is coming down.
[00:26:12.966 --> 00:26:17.168]  And we, the people, are definitely winning against the forces of darkness.
[00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:28.252]  Having said that, although it is an exciting revolutionary moment and it's really great to be part of this wonderful, popular uprising, which incidentally is supported by the US Opinion Polls.
[00:26:28.272 --> 00:26:37.955]  If you've seen the latest Pew Opinion Survey, which shows that Americans are less interested than ever in the idea of man-made global warming.
[00:26:37.975 --> 00:26:39.475]  They just don't believe it anymore.
[00:26:39.535 --> 00:26:41.196]  They think the whole thing stinks.
[00:26:41.636 --> 00:26:56.849]  So the people are on side, but unfortunately what you have is government, you have big oil, you have a lot of, you know, the big capitalist companies, you have, you know, the European technocrats.
[00:26:56.889 --> 00:26:58.611]  But see James, that shows the hoax.
[00:26:59.111 --> 00:27:04.556]  Almost all of big oil has been aligned for over a decade because they're controlled by the big banks.
[00:27:04.616 --> 00:27:07.118]  They want this new derivative scam.
[00:27:07.839 --> 00:27:09.260]  Absolutely.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.221]  The world economy has gone to pot.
[00:27:12.221 --> 00:27:13.882]  They need a new revenue stream.
[00:27:14.263 --> 00:27:21.406]  What better than to invent this wonderful new thing, which is the emperor's new clothes of global trading, and that is carbon trading.
[00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:22.887]  It is trading thin air.
[00:27:22.927 --> 00:27:24.008]  It's Enron economics.
[00:27:24.088 --> 00:27:29.711]  Well, I want to talk about that when we come back, but when I first talked to you off air, you used the analogy of the Battle of the Bulge.
[00:27:29.991 --> 00:27:30.612]  I'm afraid so.
[00:27:30.632 --> 00:27:37.599]  I think we can't talk enough about Hitler, where the Green movement is concerned, because of course the Nazis were the first Greens, really.
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:47.770]  And I think that what's going to happen next is that we're going to get a Battle of the Bulge moment, where the bad guys start coming back at us in force.
[00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:48.731]  You know, surprising.
[00:27:48.771 --> 00:27:52.055]  We think we've won, but no, they've got a lot more up their sleeve just yet.
[00:27:55.908 --> 00:27:57.429]  So how do you see this unfolding?
[00:27:57.469 --> 00:28:11.017]  They're already launching new things, the ocean's going to turn into pure acid... Well, you know, so many... yeah, that will definitely be one of their... you know, I reckon that little by little they will start abandoning the global warming lie.
[00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.231]  And they will move on to something else.
[00:28:14.431 --> 00:28:20.653]  It's obviously very important for them to portray carbon dioxide as the bad guy in all this.
[00:28:21.174 --> 00:28:23.394]  The fact is that carbon dioxide is plant food.
[00:28:23.895 --> 00:28:28.536]  Plants grow more easily the more carbon dioxide there is in the atmosphere.
[00:28:28.836 --> 00:28:40.701]  And that's why when you get industrial farming, you get these greenhouses pumped with considerably greater quantities of CO2 than we have in our atmosphere right now.
[00:28:41.561 --> 00:28:49.405]  So, if they can't show that carbon dioxide is causing global warming, how do they still go on painting it as the bad guy?
[00:28:49.765 --> 00:28:53.046]  Well, their next move is to talk about ocean acidification.
[00:28:53.526 --> 00:28:59.629]  You know, that it causes ocean acidification and this is going to be a massive disaster for our seas.
[00:28:59.649 --> 00:29:04.151]  And that's another trick, because the ocean is acid, it's carbolic.
[00:29:04.887 --> 00:29:11.870]  Yes, well also what you find is that the ecosystem deals with this sort of problem quite naturally.
[00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:13.931]  It's not going to create ecological disaster.
[00:29:14.611 --> 00:29:22.835]  But keeping up with these guys, with these slippery, you know, it's like trying to wrestle an eel covered in mud.
[00:29:23.155 --> 00:29:25.096]  I mean, how do you do it?
[00:29:25.156 --> 00:29:30.278]  How do you keep up with these new factoids that keep being produced by the warmest?
[00:29:32.466 --> 00:29:32.846]  Stay there.
[00:29:32.886 --> 00:29:34.287]  Let's continue to break that down.
[00:29:34.327 --> 00:29:35.887]  Let's get into some of the other scandals.
[00:29:36.308 --> 00:29:45.011]  Recap the criminal investigations with Climategate, Copenhagen falling apart, what Prince Charles is up to.
[00:29:45.411 --> 00:29:47.732]  It's all coming up with our guest, James Dillingpole.
[00:29:47.972 --> 00:29:50.093]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:51.293 --> 00:29:52.174]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.694 --> 00:29:54.274]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.215 --> 00:29:57.896]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.158 --> 00:30:03.761]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:04.161 --> 00:30:09.126]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.486 --> 00:30:11.228]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.548 --> 00:30:16.373]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.553 --> 00:30:17.454]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.714 --> 00:30:18.454]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.835 --> 00:30:20.435]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.736 --> 00:30:21.556]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.796 --> 00:30:23.857]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.997 --> 00:30:25.098]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.338 --> 00:30:26.679]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.859 --> 00:30:31.941]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:32.121 --> 00:30:35.323]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.723 --> 00:30:39.185]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.525 --> 00:30:40.505]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.746 --> 00:30:41.366]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.666 --> 00:30:42.566]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.766 --> 00:30:43.507]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.687 --> 00:30:44.527]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.787 --> 00:30:47.549]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:51.450]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:00.094 --> 00:31:06.958]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:31:07.078 --> 00:31:08.318]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:31:08.358 --> 00:31:09.039]  It's very real.
[00:31:09.159 --> 00:31:12.921]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[00:31:13.061 --> 00:31:17.383]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:31:47.899 --> 00:31:49.820]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:31:59.804 --> 00:32:04.047]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.348 --> 00:32:04.968]  Number one.
[00:32:05.268 --> 00:32:08.431]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.691 --> 00:32:09.272]  Number two.
[00:32:09.552 --> 00:32:14.115]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.456 --> 00:32:14.916]  It's true.
[00:32:15.196 --> 00:32:19.740]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:20.601]  Number 3.
[00:32:20.881 --> 00:32:24.163]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.464 --> 00:32:28.166]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.387 --> 00:32:28.927]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.167 --> 00:32:31.549]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.929 --> 00:32:35.332]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.612 --> 00:32:36.153]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.413 --> 00:32:40.336]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.556 --> 00:32:45.320]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.627]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:51.350]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.654]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:53.814 --> 00:32:56.158]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:33:13.089 --> 00:33:19.315]  I'm going to break down all the other big hoaxes coming up in the next hour.
[00:33:19.335 --> 00:33:27.402]  You know, we told you back in 2002, we'd gotten all the details then, that it was the most weaponized U.S.
[00:33:27.462 --> 00:33:28.804]  grade anthrax ever seen.
[00:33:29.604 --> 00:33:38.653]  Now, eight years later, the Wall Street Journal, Washington Times, reporting it was
[00:33:41.363 --> 00:33:44.546]  The most super weaponized U.S.
[00:33:45.927 --> 00:33:48.409]  And that Fort Detrick couldn't even do it.
[00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:50.411]  But that it is U.S.
[00:33:50.431 --> 00:33:50.971]  designed.
[00:33:51.171 --> 00:33:54.654]  Now, they claim that a couple different people made this in a bucket in their basement.
[00:33:55.595 --> 00:33:56.356]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:58.418 --> 00:33:59.599]  Anthrax made in the basement.
[00:34:00.319 --> 00:34:02.081]  Very rarely we'll even get somebody sick.
[00:34:03.336 --> 00:34:05.958]  You know, the trick is actually getting them infected, getting it into their lungs.
[00:34:06.899 --> 00:34:10.082]  This stuff was super miniaturized.
[00:34:10.102 --> 00:34:11.042]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[00:34:11.443 --> 00:34:12.263]  That's coming up.
[00:34:13.565 --> 00:34:17.888]  I also want to get into Oliver Stone's suggest, Hitler is easy scapegoat.
[00:34:18.088 --> 00:34:19.029]  What does that deal with?
[00:34:19.329 --> 00:34:25.615]  Well, he's got a new 10-part documentary, The Secret History of the U.S., coming out, where they actually do get into how big banks
[00:34:27.387 --> 00:34:28.308]  I don't know.
[00:34:45.686 --> 00:34:48.929]  Was a potential false flag attack to be blamed on Muslims foiled?
[00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:50.150]  Got a report there.
[00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:55.494]  Also in England they're saying airline passengers have no right to refuse naked body scanners.
[00:34:56.315 --> 00:34:58.076]  So we're going to be covering that.
[00:34:58.156 --> 00:35:00.258]  Schwarzenegger says send inmates to Mexico.
[00:35:00.838 --> 00:35:03.340]  Pretty soon they'll just send us to Devil's Island like the French did.
[00:35:04.241 --> 00:35:06.963]  But that is all coming up and your phone calls in the next hour.
[00:35:07.003 --> 00:35:08.385]  Going back to James Dillingpold.
[00:35:09.065 --> 00:35:21.396]  Who's a writer for the Times of London, Sunday Times of London, The Daily Telegraph, The Spectator, and best-selling author, of course, of Obama Land, I Have Seen Your Future, and it doesn't work.
[00:35:21.937 --> 00:35:24.299]  So, and he wrote that right when Obama got into office.
[00:35:24.339 --> 00:35:25.380]  He's certainly been proven right.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:29.163]  So we've been proven right with the Obama Deception and Fall of the Republic.
[00:35:29.183 --> 00:35:34.488]  Get those DVDs and keep educating folks, because we are starting to route these people at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:34.548 --> 00:35:35.029]  Okay, James.
[00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:41.577]  Getting back now, I've been asking a lot of questions, but I want to get into other... you're a wellspring of knowledge on these issues.
[00:35:42.198 --> 00:35:51.109]  How you see them counterattacking, how they're trying to buttress themselves by giving each other awards, Prince Charles going and visiting, the main nest of...
[00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:51.730]  Yeah.
[00:36:06.912 --> 00:36:14.981]  Well, Alex, I had a very depressing lunch on New Year's Day with a distant member of my family.
[00:36:15.581 --> 00:36:21.167]  And it turns out that he's now working for something called the European Climate Foundation.
[00:36:21.808 --> 00:36:24.651]  And the European Climate Foundation is one of those
[00:36:25.371 --> 00:36:35.253]  Charitable bodies, which is pumping in a lot, lot, lot of money into funding climate change advocacy groups.
[00:36:35.874 --> 00:36:37.474]  You know, it is up to the neck.
[00:36:37.554 --> 00:36:42.755]  It was there at Copenhagen at the negotiating table, you know, staying in all the best hotels.
[00:36:43.335 --> 00:36:54.338]  And I asked him whether Climategate, which as you remember, broke during the story, broke during the beginning of the Copenhagen, you know, libtard fest.
[00:36:55.279 --> 00:37:01.669]  And I said, has Climategate had any effect whatsoever on the negotiation process?
[00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:02.891]  And you know what he said?
[00:37:03.732 --> 00:37:05.453]  It didn't even register.
[00:37:05.573 --> 00:37:09.334]  He said, as far as we were concerned, the process moves on.
[00:37:09.694 --> 00:37:11.835]  We don't really care what other people say.
[00:37:12.375 --> 00:37:14.376]  All that matters is the process.
[00:37:14.916 --> 00:37:17.878]  And this, I'm afraid, is what we're going to see throughout the world.
[00:37:17.918 --> 00:37:30.763]  We're going to see big government ignoring the arguments against man-made global warming completely and carrying on with the legislation on carbon, carrying on with the taxing.
[00:37:32.256 --> 00:37:43.645]  The reason this scam is so dangerous, as I keep trying to remind... I blog about this every day for The Telegraph in London, and some people say to me, why do you keep going on and on about this subject?
[00:37:44.025 --> 00:37:45.607]  Why can't you talk about something else?
[00:37:45.787 --> 00:37:49.890]  Because it's... I mean, I want to hear your answer, but it's a takeover of society.
[00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:50.551]  It's a cult.
[00:37:50.651 --> 00:37:54.914]  You've got Common Purpose and others funded by this EU group.
[00:37:55.575 --> 00:37:58.777]  Here, locally in Austin, they reported last year that a CIA
[00:38:00.338 --> 00:38:00.739]  I think?
[00:38:16.949 --> 00:38:19.873]  A cult of robbers and they're brainwashing our kids.
[00:38:20.193 --> 00:38:21.335]  They're not going to stop.
[00:38:21.675 --> 00:38:24.519]  They've got kids writing fake tickets in England and the U.S.
[00:38:24.559 --> 00:38:25.360]  and the New York Times.
[00:38:25.641 --> 00:38:26.422]  Climate cops.
[00:38:26.702 --> 00:38:29.386]  They've got TV shows about reporting on your neighbors.
[00:38:29.626 --> 00:38:31.489]  The point is, this is the Bolsheviks.
[00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:42.611]  I would say, Alex, that it is no exaggeration at all to say that the Green Movement is more dangerous than the Communist Movement or even the Nazi Movement.
[00:38:42.992 --> 00:38:52.098]  And the reason is that, OK, we had to fight a terrible war to defeat Nazism, but the point was that the threat of Nazism was essentially military.
[00:38:53.219 --> 00:39:01.506]  We defeated the Soviets as well through a combination of proxy wars, and effectively Ronald Reagan bankrupted them, didn't he, through the Star Wars program.
[00:39:02.987 --> 00:39:08.031]  The Green Movement is more dangerous in a way because it is more insidious.
[00:39:08.612 --> 00:39:10.994]  It is not confronting us through military means.
[00:39:11.134 --> 00:39:20.962]  It is presenting itself as this caring movement which only a heartless, nature-hating, evil person could possibly disagree with.
[00:39:21.423 --> 00:39:25.466]  And that is why it presents a problem to those of us who understand its true menace.
[00:39:25.847 --> 00:39:29.410]  How do we show to the world at large that this
[00:39:30.399 --> 00:39:37.386]  This movement threatens our society, threatens our freedoms, threatens everything we believe in.
[00:39:37.626 --> 00:39:45.794]  It's a big problem because, you know, a lot of the people involved in the Green Movement are cuddly, polar bear loving, caring people.
[00:39:45.854 --> 00:39:47.996]  They're not nasty people.
[00:39:48.536 --> 00:39:54.302]  And it is a constant struggle fighting against their arguments.
[00:39:55.575 --> 00:40:03.380]  Well, you're absolutely right, and I mean, I have the New York Times, I have the LA Times, I see it where I live, I see the textbooks.
[00:40:05.401 --> 00:40:16.888]  I put my children in a... For example, you know, my daughter started having choir lessons at Christmas, and one of the songs they sang was that lovely song about the snowman, which is very nice.
[00:40:17.672 --> 00:40:31.771]  Another of the songs was called When Will We Learn and it went on and on about when will we learn to stop being so horrible to nature, humans are evil, we must save the planet.
[00:40:32.672 --> 00:40:34.813]  The kids are brainwashed, you know.
[00:40:49.581 --> 00:40:52.083]  And they chant these songs in the public schools.
[00:40:52.424 --> 00:40:57.668]  They have the kids go home and write fake tickets and reports on their parents.
[00:40:57.728 --> 00:40:58.809]  Don't take a hot bath.
[00:40:59.089 --> 00:41:00.871]  Don't run the water while you brush your teeth.
[00:41:01.271 --> 00:41:02.833]  And it has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:41:02.853 --> 00:41:03.333]  That's the thing.
[00:41:03.353 --> 00:41:04.494]  They say, well, it's to save the earth.
[00:41:04.834 --> 00:41:05.035]  No.
[00:41:05.335 --> 00:41:15.764]  These are cold-hearted tacticians at the top that want to create an anti-human guilt to make humanity the enemy so the collectivist can run the state.
[00:41:16.104 --> 00:41:16.784]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:41:16.804 --> 00:41:21.326]  I mean, it is very much like the Hitler Youth being encouraged to report on their parents.
[00:41:21.967 --> 00:41:31.811]  You know, my son is at one of the most expensive, most highly rated private prep schools in the country.
[00:41:32.391 --> 00:41:35.312]  And even he gets that eco-propaganda.
[00:41:35.573 --> 00:41:45.437]  And one of the reasons he gets this eco-propaganda, and the school has actually designated itself an eco-school, the reason it does so is because half the middle class mothers
[00:41:46.256 --> 00:41:48.249]  Uh, actually they like this nonsense.
[00:41:48.289 --> 00:41:49.215]  They like to hear that the...
[00:41:50.879 --> 00:41:51.959]  Let me go further.
[00:41:51.979 --> 00:41:53.580]  Mark Dice is a reporter who I know.
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:42:00.802]  He went out last week in San Diego and over 90% of the people he talked to, it was mainly women, young women and middle-aged women,
[00:42:20.228 --> 00:42:25.231]  They all, the women except for one old lady, said, ban free speech.
[00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:32.154]  He had a fake petition saying, ban free speech, arrest anybody that disagrees with Obama, it's time to shut these people up.
[00:42:32.214 --> 00:42:34.876]  And they would sign it, put their name, their info.
[00:42:34.896 --> 00:42:37.217]  I mean, they are ready.
[00:42:37.537 --> 00:42:47.803]  And they think, we run society, we're good, and so now it's a Nazi slash Soviet movement run by a bunch of useful idiot women.
[00:42:49.521 --> 00:43:02.013]  Useful idiots, well-paid husbands, middle-class women, yeah, exactly, with all these wonderful lifestyles, and they want to reintroduce eco-fascism to the world.
[00:43:02.033 --> 00:43:03.815]  It is very, very scary.
[00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.191]  Well, I didn't mean to interrupt you about your kids.
[00:43:06.251 --> 00:43:18.020]  It's just that we're all having this experience of living in a more and more Orwellian system where our children are denouncing us and, you know, literally right out of 1984, and we see it.
[00:43:19.261 --> 00:43:21.222]  This will lead to North Korea if they win.
[00:43:22.483 --> 00:43:25.984]  This is what, of course, Jonah Goldberg talks about in liberal fascism.
[00:43:26.004 --> 00:43:36.788]  You know, fascist movements throughout the 20th century, and the same applies to communist movements in the 20th century, what they needed was a cause.
[00:43:36.888 --> 00:43:46.971]  A cause so great that it required government to step in and override individual freedom because this cause was so important that only mass government action
[00:43:46.971 --> 00:43:47.411]  We're good to go.
[00:44:17.008 --> 00:44:19.290]  But didn't that backfire on them for decades?
[00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:24.335]  I'd read UN, Club of Rome, saying they were going to set up a world government, that we'd pay taxes to them.
[00:44:24.795 --> 00:44:26.557]  And they said, oh, you're crazy, that doesn't exist.
[00:44:26.577 --> 00:44:31.522]  I'm like, but I have your own book, I have your own biological diversity assessment, 1996.
[00:44:32.182 --> 00:44:38.108]  So they stonewalled, but now they come out and go, world government's here to save you, to save the penguins, the polar bears.
[00:44:39.289 --> 00:44:48.719]  I think that's another reason they're so discredited, is they're so full of hubris and arrogance, they think they can just sit up there and say, the science is settled, world government will save you.
[00:44:49.139 --> 00:44:53.063]  People fundamentally, even if they're dumbed down, know science is never settled.
[00:44:53.244 --> 00:44:54.885]  That's what the scientific method's all about.
[00:44:55.166 --> 00:44:55.866]  People know...
[00:44:56.527 --> 00:45:03.190]  I never mention often enough the involvement of Morris Strong, who was one of the great believers in world government.
[00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:06.451]  He now lives in China, of course, which is his spiritual home.
[00:45:07.411 --> 00:45:14.274]  Morris Strong, a great advocate of world government, who was also heavily exposed to the carbon trading industry.
[00:45:14.634 --> 00:45:15.374]  And guess what?
[00:45:15.414 --> 00:45:21.657]  He was the guy who was in charge of the first great eco-summit, the Rio Summit.
[00:45:21.677 --> 00:45:23.978]  That was Morris Strong's baby.
[00:45:24.525 --> 00:45:27.747]  And he said, isn't it our job to destroy industrial society?
[00:45:28.188 --> 00:45:32.230]  And now, literally every day, I see other UN scientists quoting him.
[00:45:33.051 --> 00:45:33.251]  Yes.
[00:45:33.671 --> 00:45:34.612]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:45:34.912 --> 00:45:38.155]  And you know, I mean, we were talking about science just a moment ago.
[00:45:38.255 --> 00:45:41.117]  I mean, are you aware of the concept of post-normal science?
[00:45:41.717 --> 00:45:41.977]  Yes.
[00:45:41.997 --> 00:45:49.583]  Post-normal science is the idea that the new science no longer looks for any kind of objective truth.
[00:45:49.883 --> 00:45:51.004]  It no longer looks at the
[00:45:52.062 --> 00:45:52.282]  I think.
[00:46:08.637 --> 00:46:09.979]  Man-made global warming exists.
[00:46:09.999 --> 00:46:11.059]  We're not going to look at any more evidence.
[00:46:11.099 --> 00:46:16.904]  We've decided it definitely, definitely exists because all our theoretical models show it does, so it must do.
[00:46:17.284 --> 00:46:20.727]  So what we're going to do from now on is not look at any more raw evidence.
[00:46:21.047 --> 00:46:25.331]  What we're going to do is tamper with the evidence so that it supports our cause.
[00:46:25.391 --> 00:46:26.592]  This is the new science.
[00:46:27.554 --> 00:46:29.175]  Well, I do believe in a creator.
[00:46:30.055 --> 00:46:38.518]  But, I mean, is it not beautiful that it got so much colder right as their 25-year plan, at least, that old?
[00:46:38.538 --> 00:46:42.379]  It's fantastic, Alex, you know.
[00:46:42.419 --> 00:46:46.901]  We don't have as much money on our side as the opposition does.
[00:46:46.981 --> 00:46:48.002]  My good God, we don't.
[00:46:48.342 --> 00:46:52.243]  But one thing we do have on the side is Mother Gaia.
[00:46:53.223 --> 00:46:54.364]  Or rather, the weather.
[00:46:54.684 --> 00:46:57.147]  The weather is really supporting our cause.
[00:46:57.808 --> 00:47:02.573]  I think you've been having a pretty cold time in America, haven't you?
[00:47:03.534 --> 00:47:09.401]  We've had our first major snow in years and it's been glorious
[00:47:10.021 --> 00:47:25.787]  Listen to the BBC and the Met Office and the CRU and all these other people who've been pushing this man-made global warming thing, suddenly trying to have to defend themselves against the fact that outside you've got pretty much polar conditions.
[00:47:26.307 --> 00:47:37.330]  And so they have to come up with these phrases like, weather is not the same as climate, and this is the kind of extreme weather we can expect to look forward to in the future under global warming.
[00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:40.891]  And people are saying, well, if it's warming, how come it's cold?
[00:47:40.931 --> 00:47:43.132]  And they say, well, you don't understand the science.
[00:47:43.172 --> 00:47:45.092]  You see, the science is blah, blah, blah.
[00:47:45.452 --> 00:47:46.733]  Well, it's great.
[00:47:47.253 --> 00:47:55.275]  And they said that their peer-reviewed journals were bulletproof, and every time they're examined, every time they will release the data, which is always very suspicious in science,
[00:47:56.155 --> 00:47:58.056]  We find them making mistakes.
[00:47:58.136 --> 00:47:58.917]  No, it's fraud.
[00:47:59.237 --> 00:48:03.560]  Now, and of course the mistakes are always towards saying it would be warm.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.641]  It's never the other way.
[00:48:05.341 --> 00:48:09.844]  Totally premeditated, as the climate gate documents show, but you talked about the enemy within.
[00:48:09.864 --> 00:48:15.989]  I wanted to read Marcus Tullius Cicero, Roman philosopher and historian.
[00:48:16.569 --> 00:48:22.813]  A nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious, but it cannot survive treason from within.
[00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:25.255]  An enemy at the gates is less formidable.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.483]  For he is known and carries his banner openly, i.e.
[00:48:29.543 --> 00:48:29.863]  Hitler.
[00:48:30.384 --> 00:48:33.367]  But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely.
[00:48:33.747 --> 00:48:40.394]  His sly whispers, rustling through the alleyways, heard in the very halls of the government itself.
[00:48:40.774 --> 00:48:42.656]  For the traitor appears not a traitor.
[00:48:43.036 --> 00:48:48.502]  He speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face in their arguments.
[00:48:48.962 --> 00:48:53.526]  He appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men.
[00:48:54.026 --> 00:48:55.928]  He rots the soul of a nation.
[00:48:56.328 --> 00:49:01.912]  He works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city.
[00:49:02.413 --> 00:49:06.196]  He infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist.
[00:49:06.796 --> 00:49:08.998]  A murderer is less to fear.
[00:49:09.298 --> 00:49:10.759]  The traitor is the plague.
[00:49:13.341 --> 00:49:13.962]  Well, there you are.
[00:49:14.222 --> 00:49:16.424]  Nothing new under the sun, as the ravens would say.
[00:49:18.584 --> 00:49:18.944]  Yeah.
[00:49:19.785 --> 00:49:20.245]  Exactly.
[00:49:20.285 --> 00:49:24.066]  He knew what he was talking about, didn't he?
[00:49:24.126 --> 00:49:32.430]  The enemy within is a much more insidious prospect to have to deal with than an enemy plain in view.
[00:49:33.137 --> 00:49:42.523]  But it seems the Brits are waking up to common purpose and these EU foundations literally taking control of almost every local citizen activist charity.
[00:49:42.543 --> 00:49:45.205]  I mean, it does seem people are waking up there.
[00:49:45.385 --> 00:49:50.348]  Here, Americans are a little bit slower, but I mean, it's just, it's horrible.
[00:49:51.064 --> 00:49:54.545]  Alex, I can tell you that the grass always looks greener on the other side.
[00:49:54.585 --> 00:50:00.006]  I can tell you that we are actually probably slower to pick up on these things than you are in America.
[00:50:00.646 --> 00:50:20.391]  For example, in my Obama-land book, I talk about Prime Minister Tony Blair, who completely ruined this country through all sorts of human rights legislation, all these measures designed to increase the control of the state over the populace.
[00:50:21.191 --> 00:50:23.013]  Uh, we did not rebel against him.
[00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:25.997]  We did not, you know, we drank the Kool-Aid for 12 years.
[00:50:26.317 --> 00:50:27.278]  At least in America.
[00:50:27.318 --> 00:50:29.701]  Look what's happened after only a year of Obama.
[00:50:30.041 --> 00:50:30.902]  But that's the key.
[00:50:31.182 --> 00:50:32.023]  That's the key though.
[00:50:32.584 --> 00:50:34.806]  In the name of human rights, they took your rights.
[00:50:34.967 --> 00:50:36.168]  Yeah, oh absolutely.
[00:50:36.909 --> 00:50:38.511]  But at least you Americans are fighting back.
[00:50:40.427 --> 00:50:42.790]  Well, I mean, the Brits seem to be getting pretty upset.
[00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:45.333]  The problem is Gordon Brown, he's unelected.
[00:50:45.353 --> 00:50:47.996]  You can't seem to get rid of him because they manipulate Parliament.
[00:50:48.036 --> 00:50:48.397]  Stay there.
[00:50:49.398 --> 00:50:51.140]  Final segment with you coming right back.
[00:50:51.461 --> 00:50:53.263]  James Dillingpole is our guest.
[00:50:53.303 --> 00:50:58.349]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.TV, JonesReport.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:50:58.369 --> 00:50:58.770]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:02.385]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.425 --> 00:51:07.767]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:08.027 --> 00:51:12.650]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:18.112]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:51:18.613 --> 00:51:23.295]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:23.835 --> 00:51:24.676]  We're good to go.
[00:51:53.875 --> 00:51:57.478]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:57.798 --> 00:52:00.240]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:01.241]  Hello!
[00:52:01.561 --> 00:52:05.984]  At OfTheField.com we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:52:06.324 --> 00:52:10.247]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:52:12.671 --> 00:52:15.932]  That's all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:52:16.132 --> 00:52:20.993]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf, which left me wondering if I even needed another book.
[00:52:21.293 --> 00:52:22.273]  Boy, was I wrong.
[00:52:22.553 --> 00:52:25.714]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[00:52:25.734 --> 00:52:29.515]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[00:52:29.555 --> 00:52:32.556]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[00:52:32.796 --> 00:52:33.156]  Wow!
[00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:34.557]  I watched the DVD last night.
[00:52:34.857 --> 00:52:35.957]  I was all struck.
[00:52:36.077 --> 00:52:37.577]  What wonderful work you have done.
[00:52:37.757 --> 00:52:39.918]  This information can bless many people.
[00:52:40.418 --> 00:52:41.338]  Thank you again.
[00:52:41.478 --> 00:52:42.059]  Thanks again.
[00:52:42.239 --> 00:52:45.140]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:45.760]  Thank you.
[00:52:45.961 --> 00:52:48.962]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[00:53:21.141 --> 00:53:21.381]  Yes, it is.

[00:54:04.923 --> 00:54:06.464]  This show is documented.
[00:54:06.964 --> 00:54:09.766]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.126 --> 00:54:13.687]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:14.087 --> 00:54:18.149]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:54:18.629 --> 00:54:20.770]  James Dillingpole is our guest.
[00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:24.272]  Writes for multiple international newspapers.
[00:54:25.612 --> 00:54:26.492]  Best-selling author.
[00:54:26.533 --> 00:54:27.913]  We got five minutes left with him.
[00:54:28.493 --> 00:54:28.793]  James,
[00:54:30.964 --> 00:54:34.386]  You were telling me off-air though, and I mentioned it, but I want you to elaborate.
[00:54:35.127 --> 00:54:35.807]  You know, they do this.
[00:54:35.847 --> 00:54:39.870]  They give Nobel Prizes to Obama two weeks after he's elected.
[00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:43.033]  I mean, they made the decision then.
[00:54:43.053 --> 00:54:46.435]  They make Bernanke Man of the Year.
[00:54:46.735 --> 00:54:53.280]  They have Prince Charles, you told me, going to worship the particular facility caught red-handed in Climategate.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:55:00.869]  Yeah, he's gone to tell the people at the Climatic Research Unit that everything's OK.
[00:55:00.889 --> 00:55:04.654]  He says, well done all of you, said our future king.
[00:55:04.674 --> 00:55:05.916]  So that's all right then.
[00:55:05.956 --> 00:55:11.563]  It seems that there was no climate fraud going on after all, because our Prince of Wales says so.
[00:55:13.686 --> 00:55:14.607]  It's a bit sad, isn't it?
[00:55:14.747 --> 00:55:21.212]  But there are so many powerful people involved in this scam.
[00:55:21.933 --> 00:55:24.695]  And, you know, what are we going to do about it?
[00:55:25.736 --> 00:55:36.345]  Today, you've got the Spanish Minister of the Environment talking about when Spain takes over the presidency of the European Union, that
[00:55:37.726 --> 00:55:44.670]  The fight against climate change and the steps that the European Union must urgently take in order to apply the Copenhagen Accord.
[00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:56.435]  You know, the process moves on regardless... But their own report says that their windmill systems made people lose 2.2 jobs for every... Oh, I love that fact, Alex.
[00:55:56.475 --> 00:55:57.016]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:55:57.296 --> 00:56:03.679]  For every green job that is created, 2.2 jobs are lost in the real economy.
[00:56:04.119 --> 00:56:24.948]  So you can imagine how my heart really leaps when I hear our future Prime Minister David Cameron, who was supposed to be a conservative by the way, talking about how one of his priorities when he gets into power, when Gordon Brown goes, our ailing socialist Politburo chief, when he goes, his replacement's priority is going to be to create green jobs.
[00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.749]  Yeah.
[00:56:26.669 --> 00:56:27.990]  But that's exactly what?
[00:56:29.295 --> 00:56:41.569]  Prince Charles, Prince Philip, Ted Turner, Jacques Cousteau, the UN, the individual Maury Strong, they all say they want to destroy industrial society.
[00:56:45.794 --> 00:56:47.856]  We've got to derail this gravy train somehow, Alex.
[00:56:47.876 --> 00:56:48.857]  Can you do it?
[00:56:48.877 --> 00:56:49.437]  Can you help me?
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.280]  Sir, I'm absolutely trying.
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:18.022]  We have no future if we don't, but the point I'm making is they're on record saying they want to destroy jobs.
[00:57:18.142 --> 00:57:24.944]  They know cold-bloodedly they want to bankrupt everybody, so we're all dependent on their collective estate.
[00:57:25.844 --> 00:57:30.546]  Yeah, I think there's probably a grain of truth in that.
[00:57:30.626 --> 00:57:39.248]  It's a few powerful people trying to divvy up the economy for themselves and crush the ordinary folks like you and me.
[00:57:39.639 --> 00:57:45.728]  Well, that's a grain the size of Texas.
[00:57:46.148 --> 00:57:50.194]  Every time I drill down to the base level, it's population reduction.
[00:57:50.554 --> 00:57:52.417]  I mean, look at what the Chinese said at Copenhagen.
[00:57:52.437 --> 00:57:54.200]  They said, global one-child policy.
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:58:03.368]  Yeah, well it's amazing how many of the people pushing ATW are also obsessed with the idea of reducing population.
[00:58:03.388 --> 00:58:17.041]  We've got a guy called Jonathan Porritt, who is one of Prince Charles' advisors, and he is, you know, a rampant deep green, and he is very keen on population control, which will be limited to the number of children we have.
[00:58:18.515 --> 00:58:24.601]  There is essentially a strong strain of misanthropy which runs through the hearts of many.
[00:58:24.641 --> 00:58:26.342]  James, I tell you what, I know you've got to go.
[00:58:26.382 --> 00:58:27.543]  I've got a one-minute break.
[00:58:27.884 --> 00:58:33.769]  Come back and do about four minutes with us to finish up on the next stage of the fight because I want you to be able to finish on that.
[00:58:33.849 --> 00:58:36.192]  What's coming up in Mexico?
[00:58:36.612 --> 00:58:37.393]  Stay right there.
[00:58:37.413 --> 00:58:38.634]  We'll be right back in one minute.
[00:58:42.768 --> 00:58:44.856]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.398 --> 00:58:48.570]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:55.990]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:56.310 --> 00:59:04.432]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:59:05.172 --> 00:59:09.233]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:59:09.793 --> 00:59:20.635]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:59:21.255 --> 00:59:30.259]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:35.802]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:59:36.202 --> 00:59:43.385]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:43.686 --> 00:59:46.107]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:59:53.698 --> 00:59:55.659]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:59.001]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.405 --> 01:00:06.046]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.706 --> 01:00:07.787]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.487 --> 01:00:09.628]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.228 --> 01:00:11.089]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:12.590]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.961]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.562 --> 01:00:21.643]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.344 --> 01:00:26.865]  Well, we've reached the halfway point here in this syndicated radio broadcast.
[01:00:26.965 --> 01:00:29.406]  Wednesday, the 27th day of January 2010.
[01:00:29.586 --> 01:00:34.628]  Hard to believe that the first month of 2010 is almost over.
[01:00:36.169 --> 01:00:36.949]  I was rereading 1984.
[01:00:38.976 --> 01:00:46.721]  Yesterday on air, where O'Brien is torturing Winston, and he says, the party lives on forever, all that matters is that we succeed.
[01:00:47.081 --> 01:00:51.063]  Of course, he'd been a communist and learned how they operated, and he wrote the...
[01:00:52.623 --> 01:00:54.024]  I watched the snake but not killed it, yeah.
[01:01:16.266 --> 01:01:27.377]  Yes, so their next battle plan, Gordon Brown has said they're just going to circumvent it, get wealthy nations to go ahead and put the money into the UN, and damn what the people want.
[01:01:28.058 --> 01:01:35.862]  Yeah, well, I mean, my great hope for America was that your Senate was going to scrap, was going to kill cap-and-trade.
[01:01:36.303 --> 01:01:40.565]  But, you know, Obama's going to get around that one by using the EPA.
[01:01:40.925 --> 01:01:46.528]  The EPA has decided to classify carbon dioxide as a poison.
[01:01:47.289 --> 01:01:49.730]  So it doesn't matter what the Senate thinks about it.
[01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:53.812]  This is exactly the kind of liberal fascism that was practiced by FDR.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.641]  And Obama's using the same old tricks.
[01:01:58.782 --> 01:02:08.848]  I find that increasingly in America, as in Europe, the individual has very little control over what big government does to his life.
[01:02:09.888 --> 01:02:12.110]  Big government is becoming tyrannous.
[01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:13.370]  It is doing whatever it wants.
[01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:19.034]  So what do we do ahead of the next big event we're going to have in Mexico?
[01:02:19.784 --> 01:02:21.826]  Yeah, well, Copenhagen was a flop.
[01:02:22.106 --> 01:02:31.155]  What we're going to see in Mexico in November is all the world leaders and all the eco-loons gathering together to try and really push for some hard legislation.
[01:02:31.575 --> 01:02:43.427]  But of course, that means that we've got eight months in which to present the case further for more and more people like the listeners of your show, the readers of my blogs and so on, to discover just what a fraud this
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:56.147]  You know, already we've seen in Australia that the leader of the Australian Liberal Party got kicked out of his job for trying to push cap-and-trade because the voters didn't like it.
[01:02:56.508 --> 01:03:09.617]  And I think we're going to see more and more of this, of people reacting against this scam and saying, enough is enough, we will not be taxed, we will not be regulated, in the name of a problem, ManBearPig, that was invented by Al Gore!
[01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:12.179]  But ManBearPig is real!
[01:03:12.259 --> 01:03:14.101]  It's half man, half bear, half pig!
[01:03:15.327 --> 01:03:21.270]  Pochari says he's got a peer-reviewed report that he won't give us the data on that man-bear pigs are endangered.
[01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:26.212]  Yeah, I think the time has come to kill man-bear pig.
[01:03:26.232 --> 01:03:28.553]  To scotch and kill man-bear pig.
[01:03:29.674 --> 01:03:31.495]  Well, then it would be an extinct species.
[01:03:32.195 --> 01:03:33.095]  Like the unicorn.
[01:03:34.496 --> 01:03:38.178]  Yes, and then we'd have to feel very sad about it and blame ourselves like we did with the dodo.
[01:03:39.787 --> 01:03:51.901]  So ahead of what's happening in Mexico, we just need to continue because it was the activists, the bloggers that pushed and ran the blockade of the media blackout that first week or two on Climategate.
[01:03:51.921 --> 01:03:54.484]  We've got to run the blockade with all these new scandals.
[01:03:54.784 --> 01:03:56.605]  Yeah, none of this would have happened.
[01:03:56.645 --> 01:04:03.370]  These arguments would not be being heard were it not for the blogosphere and the radio shows like yours.
[01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:06.192]  You know, the MSM has been completely against us.
[01:04:06.592 --> 01:04:09.754]  You know, the whole system has been against us trying to cover this scum up.
[01:04:10.095 --> 01:04:11.195]  I gotta throw this in quick.
[01:04:11.456 --> 01:04:20.222]  Cass Sunstein, the regulations czar, in public policy papers says it should be illegal to criticize man-made global warming.
[01:04:20.242 --> 01:04:21.342]  I don't know if you saw that.
[01:04:21.603 --> 01:04:23.244]  And separately, Europe's been saying that.
[01:04:23.846 --> 01:04:24.847]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:04:24.967 --> 01:04:29.411]  Of course they would rather silence us using whatever means at their disposal.
[01:04:29.431 --> 01:04:38.418]  And this is why, you know, our freedom of speech on the internet is more important to guard jealously than ever before because our lives and our freedoms depend upon it.
[01:04:38.718 --> 01:04:39.939]  That is no exaggeration.
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.461]  JamesDillingPoll.com is the website.
[01:04:42.481 --> 01:04:44.303]  James, always great having you on.
[01:04:44.323 --> 01:04:45.324]  I know we'll speak again.
[01:04:45.944 --> 01:04:47.385]  Have a great evening.
[01:04:47.726 --> 01:04:48.066]  Take care.
[01:04:48.697 --> 01:04:50.119]  Goodbye.
[01:04:50.179 --> 01:04:58.171]  Speaking of internet censorship, Australia, Italy, they're all announcing Chinese-style censorship.
[01:04:58.191 --> 01:04:58.872]  That's coming up too.
[01:05:01.954 --> 01:05:05.597]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:05.617 --> 01:05:08.980]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:13.984]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:05:14.004 --> 01:05:20.230]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:22.652]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:23.452]  Tim Geithner?
[01:05:23.472 --> 01:05:23.912]  Bernanke?
[01:05:23.993 --> 01:05:24.753]  They're arsonists!
[01:05:24.793 --> 01:05:25.934]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:05:25.954 --> 01:05:28.175]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:42.082 --> 01:05:46.006]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:05:46.466 --> 01:05:49.008]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:58.477]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:00.635 --> 01:06:05.860]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:08.662]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:06:08.682 --> 01:06:13.186]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:06:14.026 --> 01:06:18.470]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.

[01:06:34.517 --> 01:06:36.218]  This film needs to be seen.

[01:07:01.124 --> 01:07:03.725]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:07:04.125 --> 01:07:09.087]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:07:09.467 --> 01:07:11.187]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:07:11.507 --> 01:07:16.329]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:07:16.509 --> 01:07:17.469]  How much do you want?
[01:07:17.689 --> 01:07:18.430]  When do you want it?
[01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:20.410]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:21.531]  When will you need it?
[01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:23.831]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:07:23.971 --> 01:07:25.092]  Will there be any food?
[01:07:25.312 --> 01:07:25.912]  Will it make your
[01:07:26.052 --> 01:07:26.653]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:07:44.753 --> 01:07:47.534]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.974]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:49.994 --> 01:07:51.034]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:51.054 --> 01:07:51.455]  Big Brother.
[01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:08.224]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.964 --> 01:08:10.045]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.705 --> 01:08:11.526]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.306 --> 01:08:13.206]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.226 --> 01:08:17.489]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.049 --> 01:08:22.412]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.172 --> 01:08:33.938]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, Oliver Stone tells the truth about the US and British government funding Hitler, but he doesn't want to talk about how they funded the Communists.
[01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:48.354]  Carol Quigley at Georgetown, writing for the Globalist and Tragedy and Hope, admitted that he was allowed into their secret files and that they have financed it all, as long as it's authoritarian and centralized.
[01:08:48.855 --> 01:08:51.475]  The right wing uses fake terror.
[01:08:51.936 --> 01:08:55.537]  The left also uses it, but the right wing uses fake terror, fake wars.
[01:08:55.877 --> 01:08:58.078]  The liberals do, too, in the fake paradigm.
[01:08:58.378 --> 01:09:04.400]  But the real honey at the heart of the New World Order is fake environmentalism.
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:07.121]  And they're taking over all the towns, all the cities.
[01:09:07.521 --> 01:09:11.523]  The good news is the people are waking up to this.
[01:09:12.124 --> 01:09:18.847]  The good news is the people are now finding out this is a diabolical scam.
[01:09:19.207 --> 01:09:20.588]  That's why we just spent an hour on that.
[01:09:20.908 --> 01:09:22.809]  Have you been watching the Tim Geithner hearings?
[01:09:22.869 --> 01:09:23.649]  It's now over.
[01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:26.151]  Henry Paulson being grilled today.
[01:09:26.291 --> 01:09:34.735]  Open talk of criminal indictments, of them having to step down, of Bernanke not getting confirmed in the Senate.
[01:09:39.446 --> 01:09:44.808]  It goes on and on, so we're going to be breaking that down today as well.
[01:09:45.868 --> 01:09:59.512]  Some of the other news I have is the big Anthrax cover-up is unraveling, but I want to right now give the toll-free number out for callers to call in on these issues or whatever issues
[01:10:00.092 --> 01:10:01.672]  Uh, that you wish to discuss.
[01:10:01.713 --> 01:10:03.573]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:10:03.593 --> 01:10:03.713]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:10:03.733 --> 01:10:05.494]  We will get you up and on the air today.
[01:10:05.594 --> 01:10:13.576]  We're gonna be taking calls for the next hour and 50 minutes off and on, but please have your question or comment quickly so we can try to get to more people.
[01:10:25.299 --> 01:10:30.661]  The problem is callers call them with such important info, I tend to run off down rabbit trails.
[01:10:32.182 --> 01:10:34.383]  The first hour I just talked about how big this is.
[01:10:35.623 --> 01:10:48.389]  That their flu hoax, their WMD hoax, their 9-11 hoax, their global greenhouse tax hoax, their banker bailout hoax, it's all being exposed as a fraud.
[01:10:48.469 --> 01:10:50.870]  It's all falling down around them.
[01:10:51.650 --> 01:10:54.491]  As our last guest said, they still have the power, they're still moving forward.
[01:10:54.531 --> 01:10:55.371]  These are tyrants.
[01:10:55.811 --> 01:10:56.491]  They don't care.
[01:10:56.851 --> 01:10:58.131]  They're targeting the dumbed down.
[01:10:58.151 --> 01:10:59.231]  They're targeting the children.
[01:10:59.532 --> 01:11:02.612]  They're targeting easily gullible women.
[01:11:03.072 --> 01:11:05.993]  They are targeting, historically, who tyrants target.
[01:11:06.293 --> 01:11:17.415]  Hitler said, and Joseph Goebbels, his propaganda minister, quoted it many other times in different variants, first you get the women, then you've got the children.
[01:11:18.346 --> 01:11:20.227]  So, follow the men.
[01:11:20.987 --> 01:11:27.649]  First you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[01:11:28.049 --> 01:11:41.192]  That's why, depending on what format, but generally in advertising, more than 80%, and I learned this in basic marketing, and I didn't take a very fancy marketing class, it was 101 at a community college, you know, the history of advertising.
[01:11:41.893 --> 01:11:45.314]  It is an absolute fact, anyone in advertising knows this, over 80%
[01:11:47.054 --> 01:11:49.495]  Of advertising targets women.
[01:11:49.515 --> 01:11:52.756]  Now, on a show formatted like this, most of it targets men.
[01:11:53.236 --> 01:11:53.877]  I'd say 70%.
[01:11:54.697 --> 01:11:57.238]  Though we're a small outfit, we don't really get scientific about it.
[01:11:58.098 --> 01:12:03.600]  We just sell what we believe in, and we're men, and men historically tend to get it more.
[01:12:04.681 --> 01:12:08.422]  And it's not that women are bad or women are stupid.
[01:12:08.662 --> 01:12:09.763]  It's that they're being targeted.
[01:12:10.343 --> 01:12:13.084]  They're being targeted by scientific propaganda.
[01:12:14.028 --> 01:12:18.349]  And over 80% of TV ads, especially print ads, are for women.
[01:12:18.829 --> 01:12:31.011]  Because women tend to make the decisions on houses, on cars, on food, on drapes, on couches, on computers.
[01:12:31.791 --> 01:12:33.312]  I mean, women make the decisions.
[01:12:33.332 --> 01:12:38.613]  I mean, I'll tell you right now, I have a great relationship with my wife because we're not battling for power with each other.
[01:12:40.453 --> 01:12:45.656]  I mean, if I really say this is the way it is, this is what we're doing, she defers to me.
[01:12:45.696 --> 01:12:46.817]  That's the natural order.
[01:12:47.077 --> 01:12:50.519]  But I respect what she has to say, and she ends up basically running everything.
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:54.782]  And that's really the natural order of it.
[01:12:54.842 --> 01:13:01.406]  The man goes out, is aggressive, tries to run a business or work, defends the family.
[01:13:02.006 --> 01:13:03.447]  But generally, men defer to women.
[01:13:03.767 --> 01:13:08.931]  That's why Hitler said, first you get the women, then you got the children, so follow the men.
[01:13:10.001 --> 01:13:25.870]  And our biggest problem is women on this environmental front, because the men have been conditioned, and it is our natural state when we are given the opportunity to be lazy, to only be into sports, to want to party with our friends, want to go drink beer, or want to go fishing.
[01:13:26.831 --> 01:13:28.331]  And women are concerned.
[01:13:28.411 --> 01:13:36.176]  Women care about society, and they want to help, and the government says they tend to be more trusting.
[01:13:38.237 --> 01:13:43.621]  Whereas men just tend to not care until they're finally rallied by leaders.
[01:13:44.402 --> 01:13:51.447]  So it's the men the globalists are worried about, but they really should be worried about the women if we could ever get the message out to women.
[01:13:51.467 --> 01:13:55.571]  And once women have seen this for themselves, some of the strongest fighters for freedom are women.
[01:13:56.371 --> 01:13:57.632]  So women do care.
[01:13:57.792 --> 01:13:58.473]  Women are great.
[01:13:59.214 --> 01:13:59.814]  I love women.
[01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:09.717]  It's not an indictment of women, it's that women need to know you have been targeted.
[01:14:10.177 --> 01:14:10.598]  Period.
[01:14:11.178 --> 01:14:14.041]  You have been targeted in a big way.
[01:14:14.581 --> 01:14:15.883]  You need to understand that.
[01:14:16.283 --> 01:14:19.186]  You need to be conscious of that fact.
[01:14:19.226 --> 01:14:19.787]  You need to
[01:14:21.118 --> 01:14:24.019]  Research the claims I'm making to you right now.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:32.503]  I know most of you will just believe me out of hand, but there's nothing like going and researching the fact that most advertisement targets women.
[01:14:32.703 --> 01:14:35.604]  In fact, let's just see if this media truth is even being reported today.
[01:14:35.924 --> 01:14:37.225]  Let's go to Google and type in
[01:14:38.664 --> 01:14:40.845]  Majority of advertising targeting women.
[01:14:41.125 --> 01:14:42.086]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[01:14:42.166 --> 01:14:45.468]  Anybody in marketing knows this, but the general public doesn't know that.
[01:14:46.188 --> 01:14:49.190]  So, majority of advertisement targets women.
[01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:53.892]  We'll click web, then we'll click news, and we'll look at the different variants there.
[01:14:54.652 --> 01:15:03.357]  But, if people would just read Edward Bernays' two books, or if you'd read some of the more modern books on how they do this,
[01:15:06.533 --> 01:15:16.887]  There it is, why the vast majority of advertising, mainly advertisements, fail to resonate with their key target market, women.
[01:15:17.808 --> 01:15:22.334]  So the first statement there is, why isn't it resonating with their key target market, women?
[01:15:23.655 --> 01:15:26.276]  GM targets women in product placement blitz.
[01:15:26.756 --> 01:15:27.496]  Target women.
[01:15:28.237 --> 01:15:29.657]  Tackles car advertising.
[01:15:29.957 --> 01:15:30.718]  That's just the latest.
[01:15:31.518 --> 01:15:35.379]  Male marketers beware when marketing to women with social media.
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:40.041]  Okay, let's say how you market to women.
[01:15:40.061 --> 01:15:40.641]  It's the truth.
[01:15:40.821 --> 01:15:41.462]  It's leadership.
[01:15:41.482 --> 01:15:42.102]  That's what they want.
[01:15:42.302 --> 01:15:43.743]  They want the truth.
[01:15:44.403 --> 01:15:46.404]  You can't be Namby Pamby when you're talking to women.
[01:15:47.664 --> 01:15:49.165]  You can't fake confidence either.
[01:15:49.185 --> 01:15:50.985]  You've got to have the truth and be confident.
[01:15:51.405 --> 01:15:52.706]  Then women will listen to you.
[01:15:53.848 --> 01:16:03.153]  That's why they train men to be real ehhh and all the sitcoms and dramas show the weak, stupid party guy that gets all the women and then women actually think that's what they want and they go out and get a divorce.
[01:16:04.934 --> 01:16:10.177]  And men think if they just act dumber and act more foolish and act more weak that women are going to like them.
[01:16:10.237 --> 01:16:11.258]  No, that's not what women want.
[01:16:11.658 --> 01:16:12.598]  Women want strength.
[01:16:13.219 --> 01:16:13.559]  Okay?
[01:16:13.919 --> 01:16:15.780]  And they want somebody who doesn't compromise.
[01:16:16.561 --> 01:16:17.381]  But, side issue.
[01:16:20.711 --> 01:16:21.551]  Let's go to web.
[01:16:21.611 --> 01:16:22.212]  Click web.
[01:16:22.232 --> 01:16:24.133]  Let's see about advertising to women.
[01:16:26.734 --> 01:16:27.775]  Okay, we'll do news then.
[01:16:34.178 --> 01:16:34.578]  Yeah, look.
[01:16:34.638 --> 01:16:36.099]  Targeting teen girls.
[01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:38.240]  It just goes on and on and on.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.962]  The point is, you are being targeted.
[01:16:43.939 --> 01:16:45.680]  We need to have more discussions about this.
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:52.705]  I mean, people need to be conscious of all of this and realize that there are agendas being pushed on you.
[01:16:53.125 --> 01:16:55.106]  We're very open about our agenda here.
[01:16:55.507 --> 01:17:09.296]  Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, the strength of the family, not being broken up and controlled by the globalists, having true choices in life, letting you keep more of your money and not giving it to the social engineers.
[01:17:09.336 --> 01:17:10.096]  It's very, very simple.
[01:17:10.397 --> 01:17:13.359]  It's very, very popular, common sense, organic.
[01:17:14.386 --> 01:17:16.668]  Common law idea.
[01:17:17.708 --> 01:17:24.573]  But as I said, your phone calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:17:24.593 --> 01:17:25.093]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:17:26.755 --> 01:17:31.798]  Also coming up, as I said, Oliver Stone says, Banksters enabled Hitler and the Nazis by Kurt Nemo.
[01:17:31.858 --> 01:17:32.539]  Key article.
[01:17:33.259 --> 01:17:33.800]  I want to
[01:17:35.509 --> 01:17:36.210]  Go over that.
[01:17:37.071 --> 01:17:42.577]  I want to get into this other key stack of three key stacks actually here of news.
[01:17:43.078 --> 01:17:44.399]  We haven't really mentioned yet.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:49.265]  Send California inmates to Mexico says Schwarzenegger.
[01:17:56.218 --> 01:18:00.281]  And this sounds good actually on the surface because he's saying send undocumented.
[01:18:00.321 --> 01:18:01.642]  That's what's bankrupt in California.
[01:18:02.142 --> 01:18:05.985]  The problem is these would end up being facilities run by the U.S.
[01:18:06.025 --> 01:18:08.387]  and that only integrates the North American Union more.
[01:18:08.947 --> 01:18:10.328]  So we're going to be going over that.
[01:18:10.848 --> 01:18:14.491]  Also airlines suffered record drop in traffic in 2009.
[01:18:14.951 --> 01:18:22.877]  Not just, that's according to the International Airlines Consortium, the IATA,
[01:18:25.236 --> 01:18:30.458]  The Air Transport Association, International Air Transport Association, said that.
[01:18:31.779 --> 01:18:33.840]  But that's not just because of the economy.
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:40.063]  It's because almost everybody I talk to don't take pleasure trips on planes, which is kind of what Maury Strong wants.
[01:18:40.103 --> 01:18:41.263]  They want us to stop traveling.
[01:18:41.303 --> 01:18:42.864]  They want us to stop living.
[01:18:42.904 --> 01:18:44.404]  They want us to stop going places.
[01:18:44.444 --> 01:18:49.187]  But what do you do when you can't get on a plane without being naked body scanned?
[01:18:49.207 --> 01:18:50.287]  And now they're saying, you know what?
[01:18:50.687 --> 01:18:52.308]  We're just going to make everybody do it.
[01:18:53.797 --> 01:18:55.959]  That's why I've got to get these contests launched to expose it.
[01:18:55.979 --> 01:18:58.081]  We've got to really keep that on the front burner.
[01:18:58.662 --> 01:19:02.546]  And there's already been test cases in Colorado where they're putting the naked body scanners in.
[01:19:02.566 --> 01:19:06.330]  We posted a YouTube video of a constitutional lawyer trying to go to court.
[01:19:06.370 --> 01:19:07.971]  He said, you will not naked body scan me.
[01:19:08.872 --> 01:19:10.414]  They said, don't worry, we don't store the images.
[01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:11.335]  And he said, yes you do.
[01:19:11.355 --> 01:19:12.676]  I've done the research, which they do store it.
[01:19:13.857 --> 01:19:16.480]  I mean, you know, they're going to videotape and record his genitals.
[01:19:17.723 --> 01:19:21.044]  You know, his behind, his love handles, you know.
[01:19:21.625 --> 01:19:24.446]  I mean, this is humiliation, training you to accept it.
[01:19:25.586 --> 01:19:31.308]  And continuing dying news media looks to Apple tablet for hope.
[01:19:33.789 --> 01:19:34.570]  And guess what?
[01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:39.451]  The New York Observer reports after three months, only 35 subscriptions to Newsday website.
[01:19:40.552 --> 01:19:44.713]  Newsday, one of the biggest media outlets in the country, can't get 35 subscribers.
[01:19:45.214 --> 01:19:45.454]  They got 35.
[01:19:46.823 --> 01:19:50.504]  I mean, these people are a joke, man.
[01:19:50.984 --> 01:19:51.805]  They are hollow.
[01:19:51.845 --> 01:19:59.267]  That's why they're going for tyranny right now, because they know everybody is in full revolt against all of their revolting propaganda and garbage.
[01:20:00.988 --> 01:20:04.249]  Have your house payments skyrocketed under an adjustable rate mortgage?
[01:20:04.269 --> 01:20:05.810]  Have you been laid off?
[01:20:06.230 --> 01:20:07.190]  Or had your hours cut?
[01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:09.291]  Are balloon payments coming due?
[01:20:10.197 --> 01:20:13.438]  You need help from MortgageFraudExaminers.com.
[01:20:14.038 --> 01:20:20.039]  To stop the housing crisis, Congress and the White House are pinning their hopes on homeowners renegotiating their mortgages.
[01:20:20.459 --> 01:20:24.160]  The trouble is, the banks are saying no 80% of the time.
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:29.142]  MortgageFraudExaminers.com can help you get the leverage you need to turn things around.
[01:20:29.582 --> 01:20:33.322]  They estimate that up to 85% of all mortgages are legally deficient.
[01:20:33.643 --> 01:20:39.624]  MortgageFraudExaminers.com can perform forensic loan audits and appraisals to find legal deficits in your mortgage.
[01:20:43.826 --> 01:20:44.187]  I think so.
[01:21:01.576 --> 01:21:02.416]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:21:02.616 --> 01:21:07.958]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:21:08.138 --> 01:21:08.559]  I get it.
[01:21:08.679 --> 01:21:18.042]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:21:18.302 --> 01:21:19.482]  That's not what's happening.
[01:21:19.702 --> 01:21:24.084]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[01:21:24.304 --> 01:21:25.984]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[01:21:26.145 --> 01:21:27.965]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:21:28.185 --> 01:21:31.446]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:21:31.566 --> 01:21:35.667]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:21:35.827 --> 01:21:37.408]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:21:37.448 --> 01:21:40.668]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:21:41.389 --> 01:21:45.010]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:21:45.210 --> 01:21:45.930]  You should, too.
[01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:47.090]  Find out what they know.
[01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:50.511]  Call us, and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:21:50.691 --> 01:21:50.751]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.771 --> 01:21:50.851]  800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.871 --> 01:21:51.091]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:51.111 --> 01:21:53.694]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:53.714 --> 01:21:55.415]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:55.435 --> 01:21:56.856]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:14.311]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:22:15.071 --> 01:22:20.552]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:22:20.692 --> 01:22:25.754]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:35.856]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:22:35.976 --> 01:22:38.097]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:22:38.337 --> 01:22:39.658]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:22:39.918 --> 01:22:42.219]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:22:42.379 --> 01:22:44.220]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:49.303]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:22:49.643 --> 01:22:58.727]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:24:05.939 --> 01:24:11.262]  They railed against the crown.
[01:24:11.822 --> 01:24:14.584]  Another ragtag band.
[01:24:14.944 --> 01:24:19.366]  Declaring.
[01:24:19.506 --> 01:24:24.249]  They laid their bodies down.
[01:24:24.609 --> 01:24:25.610]  In a bloody war.
[01:24:27.851 --> 01:24:28.451]  For liberty.
[01:24:29.712 --> 01:24:31.453]  For their descendants.
[01:24:31.553 --> 01:24:32.834]  We are their descendants.
[01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:36.822]  Thanks to the renegades, we are free today.
[01:24:36.842 --> 01:24:41.224]  Alright, I'm going to get more into the dying media.
[01:24:42.625 --> 01:24:46.928]  This fake terror plot, clearly a provocateured op.
[01:24:48.109 --> 01:24:54.973]  We're going to be going over Paul Watson's article, potential false flag attack to be blamed on Muslims foiled.
[01:24:55.414 --> 01:24:57.295]  But let's go to your phone calls right now.
[01:24:57.835 --> 01:24:59.516]  Let's talk to John in Illinois.
[01:24:59.576 --> 01:25:00.357]  John, you're on the air.
[01:25:01.314 --> 01:25:04.296]  Yeah, Alex, good morning to you, or afternoon, or whatever it is.
[01:25:04.536 --> 01:25:05.977]  We are Change Chicago here.
[01:25:06.478 --> 01:25:11.781]  Your buddy David Rothkopf had an article in the latest issue of Newsweek, a brief quote.
[01:25:12.482 --> 01:25:22.589]  Current trends from rising seas and changing severe weather patterns associated with global warming mean mega disasters will only become more likely.
[01:25:22.909 --> 01:25:26.232]  So he's blaming the Haiti earthquake on this too.
[01:25:27.711 --> 01:25:28.392]  Which is hilarious.
[01:25:28.412 --> 01:25:29.252]  That's unbelievable.
[01:25:29.312 --> 01:25:30.713]  What issue of Newsweek is that?
[01:25:30.753 --> 01:25:31.374]  That is huge.
[01:25:31.414 --> 01:25:37.018]  That Rothkopf headline should be a blurb at InfoWars or Prison Planet.
[01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:41.341]  Former head of Kissinger Group or top globalist Rothkopf agrees with Danny Glover.
[01:25:42.002 --> 01:25:44.043]  Earthquake in Haiti caused by global warming.
[01:25:44.103 --> 01:25:45.204]  I mean, what baloney?
[01:25:45.765 --> 01:25:50.608]  January 25th, 2010 issue of Newsweek and also one other item before I go.
[01:25:51.309 --> 01:25:52.710]  A programming suggestion.
[01:25:54.205 --> 01:25:56.346]  More call-in days for cops only.
[01:25:56.426 --> 01:26:11.718]  We have a very articulate cop here in Chicago who will be identified only as Citizen X. He regularly calls into ManCow's show, but he thinks it's great if he can get 2 million listeners to hear his 30 seconds on ManCow.
[01:26:12.199 --> 01:26:14.821]  And I'm trying to tell him, please call into Alex.
[01:26:15.241 --> 01:26:16.482]  You'll get at least a minute.
[01:26:16.562 --> 01:26:20.145]  And this man is very articulate, pro-Second Amendment.
[01:26:20.652 --> 01:26:25.394]  And he's known as Citizen X. He wants to keep his identity unknown, of course, to the Chicago authorities.
[01:26:25.454 --> 01:26:27.836]  No, it is good to hear from the great police.
[01:26:28.376 --> 01:26:33.959]  And the cops that are pro-America and really know what's going on, they're always articulate, they're smart, really smart.
[01:26:34.479 --> 01:26:38.601]  And then police you run into that support tyranny, they're literally idiots.
[01:26:38.941 --> 01:26:40.062]  They can't even talk.
[01:26:41.442 --> 01:26:41.903]  I agree.
[01:26:41.963 --> 01:26:46.125]  And please have more like once or twice a month have cop call-in days only.
[01:26:46.165 --> 01:26:48.506]  And I guarantee if Citizen X will call in,
[01:26:48.908 --> 01:26:52.009]  And you'll be extremely impressed with what this man has to say.
[01:26:52.749 --> 01:26:55.630]  He is pro-freedom, pro-Second Amendment, and he can talk.
[01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:57.750]  John Iherian, I appreciate your call.
[01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:00.811]  Genesis never went past its six phone lines.
[01:27:01.451 --> 01:27:06.933]  And we don't screen calls, except when we say it's only on this topic a couple times a week, maybe.
[01:27:07.493 --> 01:27:09.013]  And then it's only to make sure you're on topic.
[01:27:09.513 --> 01:27:11.234]  And we let you on with whatever your opinion is.
[01:27:11.274 --> 01:27:12.134]  That's not really screening.
[01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:18.371]  But to be able to have police call in, we have to say only police, because they just can't get through on the lines.
[01:27:19.332 --> 01:27:23.114]  Same thing with military, and we miss so many really interesting calls that way.
[01:27:23.134 --> 01:27:28.117]  I need to fire up our phone system more, because it can take like over a hundred calls simultaneously.
[01:27:28.477 --> 01:27:32.620]  Then you gotta have people to get on and talk to the caller, though, and make sure they're calling in on subject.
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:34.401]  Marco in Oregon.
[01:27:34.441 --> 01:27:35.441]  You're on the air, Marco.
[01:27:37.042 --> 01:27:37.803]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:27:38.123 --> 01:27:39.444]  Thanks so much for having me on the show.
[01:27:40.218 --> 01:27:49.044]  I'm going to see if this bulletin has come to your attention about the operation, a U.S.
[01:27:49.204 --> 01:27:57.188]  relief operation that was a relief operation for Haiti that was launched out of Miami the day before the earthquake.
[01:27:58.089 --> 01:27:59.330]  Yeah, that was a press release.
[01:27:59.710 --> 01:28:01.291]  Yeah, that was put out by the Army.
[01:28:03.192 --> 01:28:03.933]  Now that's official.
[01:28:03.973 --> 01:28:06.154]  We reported that last Monday.
[01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:12.592]  Yeah, so you haven't put up anything on your site about that, or have you seen some of the documents?
[01:28:12.612 --> 01:28:13.752]  Man, we sure try.
[01:28:14.493 --> 01:28:16.633]  I sent it all to Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson.
[01:28:17.174 --> 01:28:22.256]  They wrote an article where the Israelis admit that they can artificially trigger earthquakes.
[01:28:22.296 --> 01:28:30.519]  They're doing it under testing, and with the Secretary of Defense quote about earthquake weapons, tectonic weapons, from 1997.
[01:28:31.239 --> 01:28:32.900]  And I believe we did link to that.
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:35.320]  I forget the exact headline.
[01:28:37.372 --> 01:28:38.412]  What was the exact headline?
[01:28:38.433 --> 01:28:39.613]  I mean, we actually covered it.
[01:28:41.114 --> 01:28:50.038]  It was in the NextGov technology and the Business of Government magazine on January 6th, I'm sorry, January 15th.
[01:28:50.498 --> 01:28:56.000]  The headline was, Defense launches online system to coordinate Haiti relief efforts.
[01:28:56.481 --> 01:28:59.322]  Yeah, we covered that three times last week.
[01:29:00.583 --> 01:29:01.103]  Oh, excellent.
[01:29:01.203 --> 01:29:01.624]  That's great.
[01:29:02.084 --> 01:29:07.866]  And so, have you had anything about Chavez's comments about the U.S.
[01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:09.247]  causing the quake as well?
[01:29:10.167 --> 01:29:10.467]  Yes.
[01:29:10.768 --> 01:29:20.072]  And at first, the newspapers there that basically work for him hadn't said, in fact, we did write an article about it.
[01:29:20.432 --> 01:29:21.752]  Kurt Nimmo did write an article about it.
[01:29:22.393 --> 01:29:23.793]  Chavez and the Russian fleet.
[01:29:23.933 --> 01:29:24.174]  U.S.
[01:29:24.274 --> 01:29:25.634]  use earthquake weapon on Haiti.
[01:29:25.654 --> 01:29:26.495]  That's what I was about to say.
[01:29:26.555 --> 01:29:27.915]  That was quick acting, guys.
[01:29:27.935 --> 01:29:29.076]  You got that up in about 20 seconds.
[01:29:30.016 --> 01:29:31.397]  In fact, just print it for me again.
[01:29:31.497 --> 01:29:32.238]  He wants to hear about it.
[01:29:32.578 --> 01:29:33.279]  I'll read the article.
[01:29:33.299 --> 01:29:34.359]  We're part of it when we come back.
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:35.020]  Yes, sir.
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:36.201]  We've written multiple articles.
[01:29:36.221 --> 01:29:37.341]  We've covered it ad nauseum.
[01:29:37.682 --> 01:29:38.442]  Thank you, Marco.
[01:29:38.462 --> 01:29:39.943]  Thanks for reminding us about that, though.
[01:29:40.303 --> 01:29:44.947]  Matt, Kevin, Jeff, Dwayne, and others, your calls are straight ahead on the other side.
[01:29:46.187 --> 01:29:46.828]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:46.888 --> 01:29:50.350]  InfoWars.com.
[01:29:51.471 --> 01:29:52.372]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.872 --> 01:29:54.493]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.394 --> 01:29:58.076]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.854 --> 01:30:01.835]  What's your home worth?
[01:30:02.016 --> 01:30:03.938]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:30:04.118 --> 01:30:06.862]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:30:07.162 --> 01:30:14.691]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[01:31:00.267 --> 01:31:07.111]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:31:07.251 --> 01:31:08.492]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:31:08.512 --> 01:31:09.213]  It's very real.
[01:31:09.333 --> 01:31:13.095]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:31:13.235 --> 01:31:17.558]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:31:53.784 --> 01:32:04.253]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.573 --> 01:32:08.637]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.917 --> 01:32:14.321]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.662 --> 01:32:15.122]  It's true.
[01:32:15.402 --> 01:32:19.986]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.286 --> 01:32:20.807]  Number three,
[01:32:21.087 --> 01:32:24.370]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.670 --> 01:32:28.413]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.593 --> 01:32:28.834]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.394 --> 01:32:31.756]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.157 --> 01:32:35.539]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:36.040]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:40.544]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.764 --> 01:32:45.528]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:45.808 --> 01:32:49.850]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:49.970 --> 01:32:51.550]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.770 --> 01:32:53.851]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:54.011 --> 01:32:56.272]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:56.292 --> 01:32:57.192]  Riders on the storm.
[01:32:57.212 --> 01:32:58.013]  Riders on the storm.
[01:33:14.272 --> 01:33:19.556]  Yeah, Kurt Nemo's article's got that in there.
[01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:48.051]  Used earthquake weapon on Haiti.
[01:33:48.731 --> 01:33:49.872]  That's what Chavez said.
[01:33:49.892 --> 01:33:51.134]  We didn't cover it last week.
[01:33:52.094 --> 01:33:57.299]  And he says that the Russian government gave him information to prove it.
[01:33:57.339 --> 01:34:04.946]  And then it gets into later how the Pentagon, the day before, was already getting ready for the relief operation.
[01:34:06.668 --> 01:34:08.769]  That is pretty ridiculous, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:10.171 --> 01:34:12.253]  And here's another one that we covered last week.
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:18.022]  Averting disaster, calamities like Haiti quake aren't just predictable, they're preventable.
[01:34:19.663 --> 01:34:21.604]  And then it gets into all that information.
[01:34:24.405 --> 01:34:26.806]  And I believe Watson wrote a story on that too.
[01:34:29.427 --> 01:34:31.508]  Another story written by Kurt Nemo.
[01:34:33.529 --> 01:34:37.871]  And I actually want to get him to add a clip from Martial Law, the last
[01:34:39.221 --> 01:34:41.863]  It's a two hour, 45 minute film.
[01:34:43.104 --> 01:34:50.591]  And the last 45 minutes are about how the United States and England were the main funders of the Nazis.
[01:34:51.131 --> 01:34:57.697]  And the Nazis had a secret treaty with England to be able to attack Czechoslovakia and Poland.
[01:34:57.717 --> 01:35:00.779]  Then some type of double cross happened.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.581]  The King of England
[01:35:05.535 --> 01:35:07.476]  Edward VIII had to advocate.
[01:35:08.017 --> 01:35:10.399]  The media always says because he wanted to marry an American woman.
[01:35:10.459 --> 01:35:13.801]  No, because he was running around highling Hitler and hanging out in Germany.
[01:35:14.922 --> 01:35:20.646]  So, the point is Oliver Stone says banksters enabled Hitler and the Nazis.
[01:35:20.986 --> 01:35:26.810]  Filmmaker Oliver Stone has told the Canadian press that international bankers enabled Hitler and the Nazis.
[01:35:26.890 --> 01:35:33.395]  Adolf Hitler was a psychopath and a monster, but rose to power thanks to big business leaders and other supporters who have
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:35.660]  I think?
[01:35:54.170 --> 01:35:56.091]  Interviewing him more than 20 years ago.
[01:35:56.131 --> 01:35:57.291]  Mr. Sutton's dead now.
[01:35:58.292 --> 01:36:00.012]  And he worked for the Brookings Institute.
[01:36:00.032 --> 01:36:01.213]  He worked for Congress.
[01:36:02.313 --> 01:36:09.996]  And he was tasked at Stanford to research the big foundations and big money.
[01:36:10.696 --> 01:36:16.518]  And really dug out a lot of the original research on that.
[01:36:16.558 --> 01:36:17.719]  So you can watch those videos.
[01:36:17.759 --> 01:36:18.539]  In fact, I'm tempted
[01:36:20.339 --> 01:36:28.087]  Remind me near the end of the show to play about 10 minutes of the opening interview with Anthony Sutton.
[01:36:30.189 --> 01:36:37.217]  Okay, what I'm going to do is, oh yeah, my other point about Stone, again, he doesn't even talk about
[01:36:38.717 --> 01:36:43.958]  How simultaneously, to destroy free societies, the big British and U.S.
[01:36:44.018 --> 01:37:01.382]  banks predominantly funded the Bolsheviks and the Nazis, and of course the fascists originating the Nazi movement, or what became the Nazi movement in Italy, under Benito Mussolini, who'd been a communist leftist, then became a fascist.
[01:37:01.922 --> 01:37:02.942]  Same thing with Hitler.
[01:37:03.882 --> 01:37:24.226]  Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf Adolf
[01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:34.661]  But this is all part of the larger great game that Dr. Carol Quigley wrote about in Tragedy and Hope, how the elites want to deal with dictators and thugs and centralized systems.
[01:37:35.061 --> 01:37:35.842]  They'll use the right.
[01:37:36.222 --> 01:37:37.002]  They'll use the left.
[01:37:37.063 --> 01:37:38.143]  They're total opportunists.
[01:37:38.243 --> 01:37:39.164]  It's piracy.
[01:37:39.645 --> 01:37:40.365]  It's fraud.
[01:37:40.545 --> 01:37:41.206]  It's theft.
[01:37:41.626 --> 01:37:42.227]  It's war.
[01:37:42.627 --> 01:37:43.628]  It's not fascist.
[01:37:43.668 --> 01:37:44.649]  It's not communist.
[01:37:44.729 --> 01:37:45.690]  It's not Nazi.
[01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:47.071]  It's not Catholic.
[01:37:47.131 --> 01:37:48.031]  It's not Jewish.
[01:37:49.233 --> 01:37:58.726]  It's not Scientologists, it's not Masons, though all of those major powerful groups are allied with the New World Order now.
[01:37:58.746 --> 01:38:01.250]  They've all been taken over or were with it from the start.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:18.277]  So, it's all these major ideologies seek to centralize control, and then society thinks they're going to choose what group they're part of, whether it's racially or religious or history or geography, and it doesn't matter because the elite give you all of these fake choices.
[01:38:18.317 --> 01:38:24.364]  They lay out all these different choices in front of you that are really false choices.
[01:38:26.465 --> 01:38:32.651]  Now again, I have three other big stacks of news, but I want to continue with your phone calls here right now.
[01:38:32.971 --> 01:38:35.454]  Continue with the news blitz coming up here when we start the next hour.
[01:38:36.435 --> 01:38:41.920]  Let's go ahead and let's speak to Kevin in California.
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:42.721]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[01:38:43.301 --> 01:38:44.583]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[01:38:44.623 --> 01:38:45.463]  First time caller.
[01:38:46.004 --> 01:38:47.425]  I got two things for you.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:54.705]  Message for all the people in Texas, whatever you do, do not make a mistake and vote against Debra Medina.
[01:38:54.745 --> 01:38:56.726]  You need Debra Medina as your governor.
[01:38:57.006 --> 01:38:59.848]  Put her in the Texas governor's mansion.
[01:38:59.948 --> 01:39:01.049]  Well, Debra's on tomorrow.
[01:39:01.089 --> 01:39:01.510]  Go ahead.
[01:39:02.110 --> 01:39:09.836]  My second thing is, Alex, I was going to ask you, are you familiar with the seven secret rulers of the world and who they really are?
[01:39:10.316 --> 01:39:11.637]  Do you have a list?
[01:39:11.697 --> 01:39:12.658]  Has that been exposed?
[01:39:12.718 --> 01:39:15.220]  Or is there any way of telling the public who it is?
[01:39:16.519 --> 01:39:34.301]  Well, I only go off what I can confirm, and the different managing roundtable groups, Bilderberg, Club of Rome, then the regional roundtable sub-directorates like the CFR, Royal Institute of International Affairs, but it is rumored
[01:39:35.586 --> 01:39:35.926]  I think?
[01:39:56.958 --> 01:40:00.499]  Who's talked to these people, and I believe it when he says that he doesn't make stuff up.
[01:40:01.079 --> 01:40:06.420]  And I've also seen that from other researchers, that it doesn't get smaller than a council of 13.
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:08.421]  It's a council of 13.
[01:40:10.821 --> 01:40:15.803]  But, I mean, would you like to elaborate, or do you have any points?
[01:40:16.643 --> 01:40:17.243]  Yes, I do.
[01:40:17.383 --> 01:40:24.585]  I've got this website that my friend sent me last night, and it's got on here, it's called the SkepticWiki.org.
[01:40:27.235 --> 01:40:32.618]  There's a lot of charts.
[01:40:32.718 --> 01:40:39.662]  I mean, I'm not poo-pooing it, but just because somebody makes a chart, I could make a chart with Donald Duck at the top of it.
[01:40:39.682 --> 01:40:40.722]  I mean, who does it say?
[01:40:41.323 --> 01:40:43.984]  Okay, I'll give you the companies and you tell me if you think they're legit.
[01:40:44.044 --> 01:40:49.647]  Disney Company, Kraft Foods, the Rand Corporation, Oprah Winfrey, Walmart,
[01:40:50.405 --> 01:40:58.511]  Noam Chomsky, and the other one is the... I think that's a joke website.
[01:40:59.371 --> 01:41:04.735]  I mean, that's like Mike Myers saying it's run by Colonel Sanders.
[01:41:07.437 --> 01:41:09.278]  I mean, they're saying those are the rulers of the world.
[01:41:10.439 --> 01:41:15.983]  That's what the one says, but Alex, I got documentation for you that I work for Walgreens.
[01:41:16.783 --> 01:41:17.504]  Oh, you got Walgreens.
[01:41:17.544 --> 01:41:18.365]  Okay, separate issue.
[01:41:18.385 --> 01:41:18.665]  Go ahead.
[01:41:19.232 --> 01:41:23.035]  I work for Walgreens, and we've never seen the owner to this day, and that's a pharmaceutical.
[01:41:23.195 --> 01:41:25.136]  I'm positive our owner's on that list.
[01:41:25.836 --> 01:41:26.457]  I'm positive.
[01:41:26.657 --> 01:41:28.738]  Okay, look, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:41:29.319 --> 01:41:30.640]  Send me the information, okay?
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:34.022]  Oprah Winfrey is not on the secret Council of Seven.
[01:41:34.322 --> 01:41:35.823]  We don't even know if there's a Council of Seven.
[01:41:35.843 --> 01:41:37.584]  We know there's a Council of Thirteen.
[01:41:38.385 --> 01:41:38.705]  Okay?
[01:41:40.326 --> 01:41:46.310]  Um... Oprah Winfrey, um...
[01:41:50.834 --> 01:41:56.779]  Is, has been invited to top eugenics secret conferences at the Rockefeller University.
[01:41:56.799 --> 01:42:03.283]  That's been in the Times of London to discuss forced population reduction and she is as big as it gets in media.
[01:42:03.804 --> 01:42:07.126]  The biggest thing out there because she can manipulate women.
[01:42:07.226 --> 01:42:14.131]  She's there to control women with kind of a new age type agenda that feeds into their whole plan.
[01:42:15.332 --> 01:42:19.636]  But, and some of the other names on there, if you want to know
[01:42:21.206 --> 01:42:23.987]  Who some of the most powerful people in the world are.
[01:42:25.128 --> 01:42:29.970]  It is the British House of Rothschild.
[01:42:31.410 --> 01:42:32.971]  And then there's the French House.
[01:42:33.031 --> 01:42:35.052]  They're very powerful, but not as powerful as the British.
[01:42:35.392 --> 01:42:36.192]  That's the head house.
[01:42:36.792 --> 01:42:37.893]  There's the Italian House.
[01:42:38.793 --> 01:42:40.314]  There's the German House.
[01:42:41.754 --> 01:42:46.036]  There are the Saxe-Coburg-Guthas, who are intermarried with a bunch of families.
[01:42:46.116 --> 01:42:47.677]  Intermarried with the Rothschilds as well.
[01:42:48.576 --> 01:42:49.778]  That's as high as it gets.
[01:42:49.798 --> 01:42:52.022]  The Rothschilds and the House of Gotha.
[01:42:52.543 --> 01:42:53.584]  Saxe-Koburg-Gotha.
[01:42:54.653 --> 01:42:58.296]  And they've knocked off the Habsburgs and many other royal families that they were cousins with.
[01:42:58.776 --> 01:42:59.917]  The Tsars were their cousins.
[01:42:59.937 --> 01:43:00.738]  They knocked them off.
[01:43:01.358 --> 01:43:07.743]  So really the last man standing with empires and imperial leadership are the British and the Japanese.
[01:43:07.823 --> 01:43:10.405]  The Japanese factor in at a lower rung.
[01:43:11.326 --> 01:43:14.188]  And the Japanese royalty does swear fealty.
[01:43:14.249 --> 01:43:21.734]  I've even seen the ritual at the Tower of London where all the royalty of the world comes and swears allegiance to the Queen.
[01:43:22.779 --> 01:43:25.120]  I mean, of course, the Rockefellers are right up there at the very top.
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:30.121]  The superstars of the New World Order are the super gophers.
[01:43:30.201 --> 01:43:35.803]  The men given the power, in Roman times they would call it a legate.
[01:43:37.404 --> 01:43:38.744]  And there might be as many as ten.
[01:43:40.585 --> 01:43:44.666]  And every major country under the Roman Empire, whether it was Egypt,
[01:43:45.836 --> 01:43:53.698]  Or whether it was Greece, or whether it was Judea, or whether it was Germania, or Albion, Britain today.
[01:43:57.379 --> 01:44:05.162]  They would have legates who would travel between the places to speak with the imperial seal, and to speak as the emperor.
[01:44:07.042 --> 01:44:13.144]  And so, a Henry Kissinger, a George Shultz,
[01:44:14.582 --> 01:44:19.585]  Somewhat of that level, Gordon Brown is definitely an imperial legate of the New World Order.
[01:44:20.846 --> 01:44:30.453]  And he's one of the rarities where he's actually in power and running the G20 and actually calling the shots to a great extent as the main manager right now.
[01:44:30.513 --> 01:44:35.736]  Gordon Brown is really the kingpin politically.
[01:44:36.357 --> 01:44:42.341]  But normally people don't become legates or even sub-legates because they have sub-legates as well.
[01:44:43.101 --> 01:44:44.142]  This is an imperial structure.
[01:44:45.405 --> 01:44:48.907]  Until they've already been president or prime minister and done a good job.
[01:44:49.468 --> 01:44:55.232]  And then they graduate into that level of a Henry Kissinger.
[01:44:55.312 --> 01:44:59.995]  Someone like a Henry Kissinger is more powerful than a Richard Nixon.
[01:45:00.756 --> 01:45:06.139]  And people are told, we'll give you the money, put you in power, you gotta put Robert McNamara, a legate.
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.901]  You've gotta put a Henry Kissinger, a legate.
[01:45:09.421 --> 01:45:10.342]  They're gonna call the shots.
[01:45:10.362 --> 01:45:11.403]  And you listen to the tapes.
[01:45:13.175 --> 01:45:16.736]  of McNamara, who oversaw the killing of Kennedy and the rest of it.
[01:45:17.956 --> 01:45:23.378]  And LBJ will be at his ranch outside Austin, talking to DC.
[01:45:24.578 --> 01:45:28.260]  And McNamara says, Yes, sir.
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:31.180]  But McNamara is telling him what to do.
[01:45:31.901 --> 01:45:33.661]  And the subservient one is LBJ.
[01:45:35.242 --> 01:45:38.723]  And he's telling him and LBJ saying, Okay, yes, how do I do that?
[01:45:43.283 --> 01:45:48.765]  A sub-legate would be, in the White House right now, Rahm Emanuel.
[01:45:49.285 --> 01:46:01.670]  And that's why he constantly talks down to Obama, whenever the congressional leaders of both parties are there, and the cameras aren't on, he gets up and cracks his knuckles and bosses Obama around, and they basically look to Rahm Emanuel and say, yes sir, Mr. President.
[01:46:04.071 --> 01:46:07.833]  And then they'd basically slap Obama around and tell him, get out there and read the teleprompter.
[01:46:12.185 --> 01:46:12.845]  It's bad news.
[01:46:12.905 --> 01:46:13.525]  It's bad news.
[01:46:14.226 --> 01:46:15.346]  Kevin, I appreciate your call.
[01:46:15.806 --> 01:46:17.887]  Let's talk to Jeff in South Carolina.
[01:46:17.907 --> 01:46:18.647]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[01:46:20.788 --> 01:46:22.149]  Alex, is Jeff in there?
[01:46:22.449 --> 01:46:22.849]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:22.869 --> 01:46:24.970]  Alright, Jeff in South Carolina.
[01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:27.190]  Listen, I'm a first-time caller.
[01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:34.333]  I just want to tell everybody, if you're listening and you're not sure, everything Alex says actually does come true.
[01:46:34.373 --> 01:46:35.613]  I've got an example right here.
[01:46:37.294 --> 01:46:40.075]  In South Carolina, it just came out in the paper and was
[01:46:40.785 --> 01:46:48.208]  Talking about how every baby within 24 hours has a blood sample, it's sent to the state lab, and then returned to the genetic center.
[01:46:48.868 --> 01:46:56.631]  So, and I've heard you in the past talk about how you protested Texas doing that, and I... Well, sir, let me be specific.
[01:46:57.291 --> 01:47:05.754]  I've known since I got on air 14 years ago, there's a secret UN project, and they have centers all over the world that store it.
[01:47:06.614 --> 01:47:09.356]  37 years ago, it started in a UN secret treaty.
[01:47:09.816 --> 01:47:13.539]  And now they have a secret treaty that got leaked last year for net censorship.
[01:47:13.579 --> 01:47:18.902]  And Italy's adopting it, Australia's adopting it, and I have the news where they're just totally shutting freedom down.
[01:47:19.403 --> 01:47:20.443]  They're talking about it here.
[01:47:20.884 --> 01:47:25.447]  So, so when you think, it's not the state storing it, they store it regionally.
[01:47:25.467 --> 01:47:30.530]  And your state must be one of the six different, it was four, now it's six regional departments.
[01:47:30.910 --> 01:47:33.612]  But yes, they lie to you and tell you it's a blood test.
[01:47:33.952 --> 01:47:35.053]  They could do that at the hospital.
[01:47:35.073 --> 01:47:36.034]  They save your baby's blood.
[01:47:36.674 --> 01:47:40.336]  Yeah, it's just strange when you hear it and you say, oh no, but now it came out in the paper.
[01:47:40.516 --> 01:47:41.656]  So I was like, Alex is right.
[01:47:41.696 --> 01:47:42.637]  Well, let me say this.
[01:47:42.657 --> 01:47:44.838]  You said I'm always right and it always comes true.
[01:47:45.258 --> 01:47:45.778]  Let's be clear.
[01:47:45.878 --> 01:47:46.979]  I know their game plan.
[01:47:47.699 --> 01:47:49.280]  I attempt to tell you the truth.
[01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:50.941]  I don't attempt to ever lie.
[01:47:51.641 --> 01:47:52.641]  My job is very easy.
[01:47:52.722 --> 01:47:53.462]  I do research.
[01:47:53.662 --> 01:47:54.342]  I have passion.
[01:47:54.682 --> 01:47:55.383]  I tell the truth.
[01:47:56.223 --> 01:48:00.465]  You should still check out everything I say, because I'm not infallible.
[01:48:00.785 --> 01:48:03.286]  I do make mistakes, but it's like 5% of the time out of 100.
[01:48:03.666 --> 01:48:04.387]  I mean, literally.
[01:48:05.891 --> 01:48:09.974]  We don't make a lot of mistakes here because we know what we're talking about, but go ahead.
[01:48:10.494 --> 01:48:16.218]  Well, there's something else I heard on the GCN network, and I wouldn't believe it unless I heard it from you if you research it.
[01:48:16.679 --> 01:48:23.503]  They said about the earthquake in Haiti that HAARP records were deleted the day before the earthquake happened.
[01:48:23.744 --> 01:48:25.985]  January 11th is when the records are not available.
[01:48:26.345 --> 01:48:34.451]  And they also said that certain British ships that normally are docked there left out a week earlier, and they normally stay there the whole time.
[01:48:36.565 --> 01:48:40.127]  And I thought that was interesting, but I wanted you to look into that.
[01:48:40.187 --> 01:48:43.710]  Well, no ships stay places all the time unless they're in mothballs.
[01:48:43.770 --> 01:48:46.051]  But look, they have earthquake weapons.
[01:48:46.351 --> 01:48:47.092]  That's admitted.
[01:48:47.552 --> 01:48:48.413]  That's on record.
[01:48:48.793 --> 01:48:54.817]  The Pentagon was preparing, not just a drill, but running a full op to respond to a hurricane in Haiti.
[01:48:54.937 --> 01:48:55.837]  It's not hurricane season.
[01:48:55.857 --> 01:48:58.279]  It was a drill the day before out of Florida.
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:05.504]  Chavez, who I liked to a certain degree three or four years ago because he did
[01:49:06.471 --> 01:49:12.993]  Stop the North Americans, Central South American Union, Free Trade Areas of the Americas going ahead.
[01:49:13.033 --> 01:49:26.998]  He did set them back, but then he does censor and do a lot of things, so I don't know if I believe him or not, but he says the Russians gave them data, that's the article that Curt Nemo wrote with links to it, that the Russians gave him the data that it was an earthquake tectonic weapon.
[01:49:27.318 --> 01:49:31.099]  Then I have Secretary of Defense Cohen saying they have earthquake weapons.
[01:49:31.639 --> 01:49:32.559]  So, I don't know.
[01:49:32.699 --> 01:49:43.283]  See, I have to... I know they're taking your baby's blood and putting it in a bioweapon lab to study race-specific bioweapons and also patent key DNA strands and key...
[01:49:47.110 --> 01:49:47.450]  Thank you
[01:50:08.650 --> 01:50:09.630]  Yeah, it's incredible man.
[01:50:38.326 --> 01:50:44.168]  But again, go look that up, because ten years ago that's foggy, but I know I read it and saw it and did several stories on it.
[01:50:44.749 --> 01:50:46.449]  In fact, Google this for me right now, guys.
[01:50:46.889 --> 01:50:49.030]  Courts rule you do not own your own DNA.
[01:50:49.070 --> 01:50:50.111]  That should pull it up.
[01:50:52.091 --> 01:50:54.852]  For genetic treatments, you'll have to add that or it'll be some police case.
[01:50:55.313 --> 01:50:56.133]  Appreciate your call, sir.

[01:52:02.148 --> 01:52:05.795]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:06.175 --> 01:52:09.181]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:09.421 --> 01:52:10.824]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:52:11.725 --> 01:52:14.186]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:14.206 --> 01:52:20.488]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:20.588 --> 01:52:25.630]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:25.790 --> 01:52:35.774]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:35.894 --> 01:52:37.995]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:38.236 --> 01:52:39.556]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:39.816 --> 01:52:42.118]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:42.278 --> 01:52:44.119]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:44.399 --> 01:52:49.222]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:54:05.518 --> 01:54:08.880]  No matter...
[01:54:22.762 --> 01:54:28.186]  Yeah, we search engine for court rules.
[01:54:31.168 --> 01:54:38.892]  Citizens do not own their own DNA and it came up with police can now taser you to make you give DNA or to make you answer questions.
[01:54:39.793 --> 01:54:40.193]  Torture.
[01:54:43.836 --> 01:54:50.120]  We might want to search under court rules biotech company owns man's DNA.
[01:54:52.079 --> 01:54:52.700]  That should get it.
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:54.761]  It was a California federal court.
[01:54:55.202 --> 01:55:00.766]  I've seen several of them over the years, but again, they get your blood and then they own it.
[01:55:00.986 --> 01:55:07.192]  And it goes to the UN, it goes to Cold Springs Harbor, Human Genome Project, IBM, Eugenics, that's all on record.
[01:55:07.632 --> 01:55:13.457]  But I like to just say something here on air, and if it was 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years ago, I like to then try to pull it up.
[01:55:14.656 --> 01:55:20.460]  The problem with the internet is, newer stuff in the last few years is the first 10 or 15, 20 search pages.
[01:55:21.081 --> 01:55:26.544]  Unless you can get the headline exactly right, and my weakness is, I can't remember headlines from 10 years ago.
[01:55:26.805 --> 01:55:27.145]  Usually.
[01:55:28.726 --> 01:55:29.086]  Usually.
[01:55:31.968 --> 01:55:36.952]  Some things I've quoted so many times on air, I can remember stuff from 14 years ago.
[01:55:39.714 --> 01:55:40.194]  Like U.S.
[01:55:40.234 --> 01:55:42.195]  Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B.
[01:55:48.393 --> 01:55:52.274]  I can only do that without even trying to think about it.
[01:55:52.314 --> 01:55:54.455]  It just has to spontaneously pop out.
[01:55:56.975 --> 01:56:04.938]  I'm 36 next month, and they say when you hit age 30, you start losing massive brain cells every day.
[01:56:05.978 --> 01:56:12.540]  And if you did have a photographic memory, it starts to fade with most people.
[01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:16.801]  I still have a great memory, but now I can't do that hat trick.
[01:56:17.836 --> 01:56:20.039]  I could do it previously.
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:22.701]  There's the CBS.
[01:56:24.604 --> 01:56:25.344]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:56:25.384 --> 01:56:25.905]  You found it.
[01:56:27.026 --> 01:56:28.027]  And how many years old?
[01:56:28.208 --> 01:56:28.368]  That's 2009.
[01:56:28.428 --> 01:56:29.889]  So that's a new one, see?
[01:56:32.455 --> 01:56:33.156]  That's a new one.
[01:56:33.516 --> 01:56:34.156]  Print that for me.
[01:56:34.196 --> 01:56:35.357]  It says exactly what I was saying.
[01:56:35.758 --> 01:56:40.922]  It's hard to believe, but private companies hold the patent rights to some of the genes in your body.
[01:56:41.382 --> 01:56:45.045]  The companies say the patents help them develop new treatments for serious diseases.
[01:56:45.085 --> 01:56:47.628]  But this week, a group of cancer patients... See, I told you.
[01:56:47.828 --> 01:56:49.089]  Ten years ago, it was cancer patients.
[01:56:51.130 --> 01:56:57.055]  And the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit claiming the patents put them in danger, reports CBS News correspondent.
[01:56:59.177 --> 01:57:01.119]  Exactly as I said from ten years ago.
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:04.060]  And then here's some more.
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:06.181]  When you do a search, you find completely unrelated stuff.
[01:57:06.542 --> 01:57:09.283]  Indiana court, no warrant needed to force DNA testing.
[01:57:09.983 --> 01:57:10.663]  Oh, that's freedom.
[01:57:12.344 --> 01:57:13.305]  Defense shocked.
[01:57:13.405 --> 01:57:15.866]  Court rules police can taser to collect DNA samples.
[01:57:17.387 --> 01:57:21.108]  Brits arresting people solely to get their DNA on the suspect's database.
[01:57:21.989 --> 01:57:22.629]  And here it is.
[01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:27.271]  Can corporations own your DNA?
[01:57:27.611 --> 01:57:32.894]  And see, the thing is, whenever I have reporters here, I'll just rattle the stuff off at them, and they just think I'm making it up.
[01:57:33.988 --> 01:57:35.689]  Because I guess they can't rattle it off.
[01:57:36.369 --> 01:57:38.510]  They don't do this 14 hours a day.
[01:57:40.330 --> 01:57:41.551]  Rattle it off, rattle it off.
[01:57:41.571 --> 01:57:44.011]  I mean, I said exactly what it was.
[01:57:45.552 --> 01:57:48.693]  And there it is, but can't find the 10-year-old article.
[01:57:49.113 --> 01:57:58.476]  Sorry, we've got one here from CBS News that came out May 13th of 2009, last year.
[01:58:03.829 --> 01:58:08.094]  I briefly want to remind listeners that I am a documentary film maker.
[01:58:08.795 --> 01:58:14.081]  If you believe in what we're doing here, financially support us, plus get the most powerful videos out there bar none.
[01:58:17.065 --> 01:58:20.389]  Follow the Republic, Obama Deception, Endgame, Terror Storm.
[01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:23.711]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:23.751 --> 01:58:25.232]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.158 --> 01:58:53.759]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:58:54.159 --> 01:58:59.122]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:58:59.502 --> 01:59:01.223]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:59:01.543 --> 01:59:06.345]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:59:06.545 --> 01:59:07.505]  How much do you want?
[01:59:07.725 --> 01:59:08.466]  When do you want it?
[01:59:08.846 --> 01:59:10.447]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:59:10.727 --> 01:59:11.567]  When will you need it?
[01:59:11.807 --> 01:59:13.868]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:59:14.008 --> 01:59:15.109]  Will there be any food?
[01:59:15.349 --> 01:59:16.689]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:17.890]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:59:18.090 --> 01:59:18.491]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:37.551]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:37.831 --> 01:59:40.011]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:59:40.031 --> 01:59:41.031]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:41.051 --> 01:59:42.212]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:42.252 --> 01:59:44.072]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:12.034 --> 02:00:16.396]  We're already into the final hour.
[02:00:16.436 --> 02:00:18.017]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:00:18.097 --> 02:00:19.657]  I want to continue with some calls.
[02:00:20.158 --> 02:00:23.179]  Then I will get into these other three stacks of key news.
[02:00:23.279 --> 02:00:25.720]  We've been covering quite a bit of news here today.
[02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:30.022]  Proud of myself, keeping to the schedule to get out as much information as possible.
[02:00:30.602 --> 02:00:33.644]  Buddy, in New York, how may I serve you?
[02:00:34.864 --> 02:00:35.704]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:00:36.125 --> 02:00:36.385]  Good.
[02:00:37.625 --> 02:00:38.946]  Um, I got a...
[02:00:39.588 --> 02:00:40.829]  Three quick things.
[02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:47.055]  First thing, a guy on YouTube called Nut N' Fancy, he's like a big gun guy.
[02:00:47.095 --> 02:00:49.257]  I think he would be a good guest to have on your show.
[02:00:49.437 --> 02:00:52.220]  What's going on with you guys at the gun show down in Texas?
[02:00:53.601 --> 02:00:54.762]  He'd be a pretty interesting guy.
[02:00:54.782 --> 02:00:58.105]  He reviews guns and survival gear and stuff like that.
[02:00:58.125 --> 02:01:04.191]  He has like a huge viewer base on YouTube, so it'd be a good way of waking a lot of people up.
[02:01:05.232 --> 02:01:05.492]  Okay.
[02:01:06.738 --> 02:01:16.143]  And second thing is, if Deborah Medina gets in, Texas is going to be like the new Patriot Haven for people to just, you know, flock to, man.
[02:01:16.763 --> 02:01:21.346]  Well, because then it will lead other people to run for state office, but in Texas,
[02:01:22.645 --> 02:01:33.430]  The governors are actually weak compared to other states, because under Reconstruction they put in a bunch of puppet governors, and so the lieutenant governor is really the governor of Texas.
[02:01:34.251 --> 02:01:47.997]  Though the governor does have some power in their bully pulpit and their veto power, and the governors have taken more power on themselves in Texas in the last few decades, but it is going to be a great victory, buddy.
[02:01:48.037 --> 02:01:48.998]  I appreciate your call.
[02:01:49.078 --> 02:01:51.099]  Michael in California, you're on the air.
[02:01:53.419 --> 02:01:53.759]  Alex?
[02:01:54.219 --> 02:01:54.680]  Yes, sir?
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:56.240]  How you doing, man?
[02:01:56.380 --> 02:02:01.382]  I'm just calling regarding the comments that you made on communism and stuff like that.
[02:02:01.462 --> 02:02:17.208]  I was listening to your show a few days ago regarding Glenn Beck's documentaries and stuff like that, that he's going to start doing, and I decided to look into it, and I actually watched it on Friday, and I feel like it was pretty good.
[02:02:17.228 --> 02:02:17.968]  It was okay.
[02:02:17.988 --> 02:02:19.469]  It left out a lot of details, of course.
[02:02:20.582 --> 02:02:30.209]  I feel like it's a great way to start handing out your endgame movie at other shows.
[02:02:30.730 --> 02:02:36.974]  I saw that they were having a tour, Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly.
[02:02:37.054 --> 02:02:41.097]  They're going to hit up California where I'm at and obviously Texas also.
[02:02:41.358 --> 02:02:48.123]  I feel like it's a great way to start possibly standing outside of their shows and handing out lots of documentaries.
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:55.123]  I've done a lot of soul searching over Beck.
[02:02:56.063 --> 02:03:04.028]  I know he's betrayed us a lot, said Ron Paul's bad even last year, said the FEMA camps aren't real when he knows that's a lie.
[02:03:06.744 --> 02:03:07.985]  More wars are good.
[02:03:08.005 --> 02:03:20.349]  I mean, he's a neocon, but he is doing a lot of good on exposing the fake environmental movement, on exposing government-run healthcare, and
[02:03:23.934 --> 02:03:27.136]  If he just kept going like he was going, he wouldn't be so bad.
[02:03:27.536 --> 02:03:34.581]  The problem is, I've seen the way he turns on people, and I know how he's taken over our movement, so that they can direct it.
[02:03:35.261 --> 02:03:39.764]  And I just, uh, so... I hate bashing other media people.
[02:03:39.824 --> 02:03:41.024]  I don't spend a lot of time doing it.
[02:03:41.485 --> 02:03:46.508]  I don't get all vitriolically happy whenever Limbaugh is caught with drugs or, you know, in more trouble.
[02:03:47.348 --> 02:03:51.611]  Um... But... Glenn Beck is...
[02:03:53.564 --> 02:03:54.224]  He's dangerous.
[02:03:55.365 --> 02:04:12.373]  And I just want Glenn Beck to know that we're going to hold him accountable, that we're watching him, that we know what he's done, that we've chronicled and created catalogs of all of his flip-flopping and supporting the banker bailout, and then saying he didn't, and then saying he apologized when we pointed it out.
[02:04:13.613 --> 02:04:20.857]  I mean, I know he's an actor, he's a talented guy, and I wish him well.
[02:04:22.060 --> 02:04:28.488]  But I want him to know, I mean obviously he's a lot better than Chris Matthews, who's openly evil.
[02:04:30.150 --> 02:04:34.535]  The problem is we know the Republican Party is just as bad as the Democratic Party at the leadership level.
[02:04:34.775 --> 02:04:35.336]  They're globalists.
[02:04:36.237 --> 02:04:40.341]  And so as long as Glenn Beck keeps explaining that, which he's doing more and more, that's a good thing.
[02:04:41.297 --> 02:04:47.083]  I mean, you know, I tuned in two weeks, a week and a half ago, and he was saying 9-11 truthers are going to kill Obama.
[02:04:47.123 --> 02:04:49.606]  I mean, that is just slander.
[02:04:50.447 --> 02:04:55.112]  Because he knows it's an inside job, and he's defending the military-industrial complex that staged the attacks.
[02:04:55.873 --> 02:04:57.034]  We're watching you, Glenn Beck.
[02:04:57.054 --> 02:04:57.595]  Let's know that.

[02:06:00.322 --> 02:06:04.543]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:04.864 --> 02:06:05.484]  Number one.
[02:06:05.784 --> 02:06:08.945]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.205 --> 02:06:09.765]  Number two.
[02:06:10.065 --> 02:06:14.607]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:14.947 --> 02:06:15.407]  It's true.
[02:06:15.687 --> 02:06:20.249]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.569 --> 02:06:21.110]  Number 3.
[02:06:21.390 --> 02:06:24.673]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:24.973 --> 02:06:28.696]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:28.897 --> 02:06:29.437]  Number 4.
[02:06:29.697 --> 02:06:32.059]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.460 --> 02:06:35.843]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.123 --> 02:06:36.343]  Number 5.
[02:06:36.924 --> 02:06:40.847]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.068 --> 02:06:45.832]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:07:00.615 --> 02:07:01.235]  Hi, everyone.
[02:07:01.415 --> 02:07:02.275]  Andy Anderson here.
[02:07:02.476 --> 02:07:06.717]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[02:07:06.877 --> 02:07:12.538]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[02:07:12.658 --> 02:07:16.919]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, good-bye effectiveness?
[02:07:17.020 --> 02:07:18.700]  No more protection till you use it again.
[02:07:18.860 --> 02:07:20.040]  PureWorks to the rescue!

[02:08:02.404 --> 02:08:08.438]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:12.027]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:32.398 --> 02:08:34.520]  All right, we're back live here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:38.002]  Had trouble with my earpiece getting in here.
[02:08:38.062 --> 02:08:42.646]  I took my jacket off to stretch, and it got all newfangled and turned around.
[02:08:42.886 --> 02:08:44.247]  Boys, come in here and fix this for me.
[02:08:44.287 --> 02:08:44.627]  Thank you.
[02:08:46.269 --> 02:08:47.810]  Thank you so much.
[02:08:47.930 --> 02:08:50.752]  We are continuing with your phone calls.
[02:08:51.773 --> 02:08:57.097]  And then I am going to, in a disciplined, disciplined fashion,
[02:08:58.376 --> 02:09:04.062]  Go over all of the top news that I haven't even gotten to yet and then recap what happened with Geithner.
[02:09:04.102 --> 02:09:08.026]  We are continuing here today with your phone calls.
[02:09:09.608 --> 02:09:11.290]  Let's go to Matt in Ohio.
[02:09:11.390 --> 02:09:12.191]  Matt, you're on the air.
[02:09:12.251 --> 02:09:12.551]  Welcome.
[02:09:12.571 --> 02:09:13.152]  Thanks for holding.
[02:09:14.233 --> 02:09:14.633]  Hi, Alex.
[02:09:14.673 --> 02:09:15.534]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:09:16.055 --> 02:09:16.655]  Thanks for calling.
[02:09:17.895 --> 02:09:19.196]  I got one comment for you.
[02:09:19.236 --> 02:09:21.718]  Well, two comments, and then just a couple quick questions.
[02:09:22.338 --> 02:09:33.486]  First, I really want to thank you for organizing the troops out in Austin, because anytime someone defends the Second Amendment anywhere in the United States, they defend it for the rest of us everywhere else in the United States.
[02:09:34.227 --> 02:09:37.789]  I also want to commend all the people that came out and helped you.
[02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:39.951]  That's great.
[02:09:41.072 --> 02:09:41.672]  It is wonderful.
[02:09:45.408 --> 02:10:09.291]  I heard you show, when you were talking about Glenn Beck and the danger of the population just kind of going over to the right, the fake conservative movement, and I think the 9-11 documentaries and the fake terror certainly helped to expose that aspect of it.
[02:10:10.331 --> 02:10:19.953]  And that's why Cass Sunstein at the White House and Glenn Beck are going off the same talking points and the Homeland Security documents demonizing 9-11 truth.
[02:10:20.433 --> 02:10:33.216]  They know that if that fable, that legend, that hoax that we've got to give our rights up or these foreign enemies will get us, their whole fraud of the naked body scanners, the police state, NORTHCOM, is built on that.
[02:10:33.256 --> 02:10:39.058]  Remember in the debate, the Republican primary debate, how the Republicans all lined up and demonized Ron Paul.
[02:10:40.158 --> 02:10:59.108]  There's a great article by Nate Blakeslee in the, I just saw it again last night, in Texas Monthly, where he chronicles what we all watched on television, but then behind the scenes, how the Republicans were all just savaging him on the stage, off the stage, because he was exposing the fraud of these wars.
[02:10:59.548 --> 02:11:01.169]  I mean, these are not conservatives.
[02:11:01.849 --> 02:11:08.973]  And so just understand, they're not going to reverse much of what Obama did, and they're going to continue the police state once they get in power.
[02:11:09.013 --> 02:11:09.313]  Go ahead.
[02:11:10.862 --> 02:11:24.536]  Yeah, and I think where the Republicans are particularly, or the neocons, it's important to make the distinction, are particularly vulnerable is in their massive spending because... The banker bailout, tripling the size of government.
[02:11:24.797 --> 02:11:26.719]  Claiming they're against it now, absolutely.
[02:11:27.606 --> 02:11:35.069]  Yes, because there's a large number of just mainline conservatives who just won't open their eyes to 9-11.
[02:11:35.169 --> 02:11:37.290]  Eventually they will, but right now they're just not ready.
[02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:48.475]  But you show them how much the neocons are spending, how far they're digging us into a debt that can never be repaid, and I think they'll revolt against Glenn Beck and the others.
[02:11:51.096 --> 02:11:53.598]  We're going to freeze discretionary spending.
[02:11:53.618 --> 02:12:00.403]  That means to the citizens, welfare, they've gotten us addicted, we're domesticated, now they're going to slaughter some of the hogs for Christmas.
[02:12:01.224 --> 02:12:09.390]  And so they're going to cut all of the benefits, cut the Medicare, cut the Medicaid, as the taxes and revenue go up and up and up, because it all goes to the bankers.
[02:12:09.851 --> 02:12:17.056]  So, unlimited money to the bankers and the military-industrial complex, more wars, the troops serving 2, 3, 4, 5, now some 6 tours in the last 8 years.
[02:12:19.319 --> 02:12:22.107]  It goes on and on and on and on.
[02:12:25.154 --> 02:12:38.461]  And one thing, in addition to the spending, I think if the mainline conservative understands that terrorism isn't a tactic that's meant to overthrow your military, to destroy your government, obviously it can't do that.
[02:12:38.801 --> 02:12:45.124]  Instead, it's a tactic particularly designed to deplete your treasury, to destroy your government.
[02:12:45.545 --> 02:12:51.788]  And then when they look and see the fact that, wow, we're doing exactly that, we're depleting our treasury in order to fight this terrorism,
[02:12:52.368 --> 02:12:55.530]  I think then people understand, gee, you know, maybe the terrorists are winning.
[02:12:55.690 --> 02:12:57.511]  Not because, you know, they control the country.
[02:12:57.551 --> 02:13:01.334]  Yeah, but see, the central bankers want to bankrupt us to be into debt.
[02:13:01.414 --> 02:13:03.495]  To them, they are the terrorists.
[02:13:03.575 --> 02:13:05.376]  They're staging most of the big terror attacks.
[02:13:05.416 --> 02:13:06.297]  I appreciate your call.
[02:13:06.957 --> 02:13:08.458]  I mean, it's far worse than that.
[02:13:08.498 --> 02:13:13.161]  Look, I respect Michael Savage.
[02:13:14.454 --> 02:13:17.317]  Because he will tell it like it is on many issues.
[02:13:18.077 --> 02:13:20.119]  I mean, he's light years ahead of Rush Limbaugh.
[02:13:20.419 --> 02:13:23.702]  Light years ahead of Glenn Beck.
[02:13:24.523 --> 02:13:26.104]  He was against the Baker bailout.
[02:13:27.265 --> 02:13:32.290]  He, you know, has exposed the Patriot Act being used against American citizens.
[02:13:34.844 --> 02:13:35.985]  Calls it a new world order.
[02:13:36.345 --> 02:13:40.867]  But most importantly, he talks about Obama a year ago.
[02:13:41.347 --> 02:13:48.851]  When Obama was first elected, he said Obama will stage terror attacks as soon as his approval rating plunges and people find out who he is.
[02:13:49.391 --> 02:13:51.272]  Savage knew like I knew a year ago.
[02:13:51.292 --> 02:13:56.414]  Well, I even knew before Obama got elected that he was going to be the guy that started the film the day he was elected.
[02:13:56.454 --> 02:13:58.015]  Obama Deception started making it.
[02:13:58.035 --> 02:14:00.576]  It was out in early March of 2009.
[02:14:04.059 --> 02:14:06.740]  But he knew they were going to stage terror attacks, and they are.
[02:14:07.260 --> 02:14:13.063]  And now seeing bin Laden's alive, here's a new tape, a new fake tape, and oh, the underwear bombing clearly staged.
[02:14:13.803 --> 02:14:18.525]  Now the FBI's had to admit all those things that Kurt Haskell said were all true.
[02:14:18.545 --> 02:14:19.826]  In fact, have we called Kurt Haskell?
[02:14:24.227 --> 02:14:24.848]  Is he coming on?
[02:14:24.868 --> 02:14:26.048]  Because he was totally vindicated.
[02:14:26.068 --> 02:14:27.829]  They completely caved in the minute he was right now.
[02:14:29.230 --> 02:14:30.030]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:14:32.028 --> 02:14:32.969]  Okay, good, good, good.
[02:14:32.989 --> 02:14:33.849]  I just want to remind you guys.
[02:14:33.870 --> 02:14:37.172]  You know, that broke Sunday.
[02:14:37.312 --> 02:14:40.255]  CNN, the FBI goes, okay, there was a second guy we detained and arrested.
[02:14:40.275 --> 02:14:41.155]  We won't tell you who he is.
[02:14:41.175 --> 02:14:41.656]  Forget about it.
[02:14:42.136 --> 02:14:42.877]  We were watching him.
[02:14:42.897 --> 02:14:43.757]  He was on a no-fly list.
[02:14:43.777 --> 02:14:44.278]  We let him on.
[02:14:45.759 --> 02:14:46.740]  Yeah, there might have been a bomb.
[02:14:46.900 --> 02:14:48.701]  I mean, you know, just, oh, yeah, Shark Dress Man?
[02:14:48.882 --> 02:14:50.243]  Oh, you know, just on and on.
[02:14:50.303 --> 02:14:51.684]  Oh, somebody videotaping the whole event?
[02:14:53.225 --> 02:14:59.910]  But the issue that I'm trying to get at with the last caller is we know
[02:15:01.033 --> 02:15:04.019]  That they are staging terror attacks.
[02:15:04.119 --> 02:15:06.343]  We know that their approval rating was going to go down.
[02:15:06.964 --> 02:15:10.250]  We understood this whole messianic thing was a front that was going to fall apart.
[02:15:10.590 --> 02:15:11.973]  We knew he wasn't going to deliver.
[02:15:12.699 --> 02:15:20.263]  Now, Glen Beck saying, I'm bad and the 9-11 truthers want to kill Obama with no evidence, just saying it almost every day on the radio.
[02:15:20.884 --> 02:15:24.245]  Oh, Secret Service, protect Obama from the 9-11 truthers.
[02:15:24.265 --> 02:15:25.126]  Like, we're terrorists.
[02:15:25.546 --> 02:15:35.632]  That's a talking point he's been following since 2007, that Ron Paul supporters are going to bomb buildings, that Ron Paul supporters are these dangerous 9-11 truthers.
[02:15:36.712 --> 02:15:46.000]  That Ron Paul supporters want terrorism, that Ron Paul supporters want to work with Al Qaeda, when we're saying it isn't even real, because the history shows that and the facts.
[02:15:47.581 --> 02:15:50.503]  On and on and on and on and on.
[02:15:51.004 --> 02:15:58.109]  And now if Obama states it's a terror attack, and I try to come out against it, I'll guarantee you Glenn Beck's going to be saying I'm bad.
[02:15:59.170 --> 02:16:00.811]  That guy will flip on you in a minute.
[02:16:00.871 --> 02:16:02.573]  He flip-flops like a flounder.
[02:16:07.056 --> 02:16:08.037]  What am I supposed to do here?
[02:16:08.077 --> 02:16:09.738]  I mean, it's elementary.
[02:16:10.158 --> 02:16:12.340]  It's elementary information.
[02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:13.661]  Okay?
[02:16:14.461 --> 02:16:16.863]  Our government's declassified over 200 times.
[02:16:16.943 --> 02:16:18.144]  It's staged terror attacks.
[02:16:18.264 --> 02:16:19.024]  It's admitted.
[02:16:19.345 --> 02:16:22.147]  It's in army manuals for captains and above.
[02:16:22.447 --> 02:16:24.668]  In special ops, how to stage false flags.
[02:16:25.769 --> 02:16:27.030]  It's in the manuals!
[02:16:27.150 --> 02:16:27.891]  They do it!
[02:16:28.631 --> 02:16:29.872]  It's a tool of war!
[02:16:31.073 --> 02:16:32.094]  And here's the coup de grace.
[02:16:32.898 --> 02:16:36.821]  For everybody out there in denial, all the fake conservatives, let me break your conditioning right now.
[02:16:37.521 --> 02:16:40.343]  If all of that doesn't wake you up, does this wake you up?
[02:16:43.366 --> 02:16:45.207]  MYAC, Homeland Security Documents.
[02:16:45.908 --> 02:16:55.595]  Remember those last year that gun owners, veterans, libertarians, conservatives, returning veterans are the number one threat and Homeland Security is set up for us?
[02:16:58.322 --> 02:17:09.088]  The whole thing is set up for you, not the CIA asset, admittedly, former CIA asset, current CIA asset, dead in the ground, Osama Bin Laden.
[02:17:09.148 --> 02:17:10.648]  I mean, it's elementary.
[02:17:12.229 --> 02:17:15.031]  The fake Bin Laden tapes, they admit are fake over and over again.
[02:17:15.291 --> 02:17:17.052]  And they think you're so stupid they put them out.
[02:17:17.392 --> 02:17:23.335]  They are playing you, just like Obama supporters are being played by Obama.
[02:17:23.355 --> 02:17:24.456]  Just stop being chumps.
[02:17:24.536 --> 02:17:25.316]  I mean, come on.
[02:17:25.716 --> 02:17:26.577]  Who's up next here, John?
[02:17:28.934 --> 02:17:30.934]  Roman in Indiana, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:17:31.755 --> 02:17:43.097]  Yes, Alex, I'm a first-time caller, long-time listener, and I'd like to bring out a few points about the family and how this evil system is trying to destroy it.
[02:17:45.657 --> 02:17:52.278]  I'm in one of the poorest counties of the state of Indiana, if not the poorest.
[02:17:52.719 --> 02:17:54.979]  And the CPS is hunting the families.
[02:17:55.541 --> 02:18:03.926]  Oh, and the dark side is really strong in these counties because they seem to be able to push the people around really easily.
[02:18:03.946 --> 02:18:05.007]  That's where evil moves.
[02:18:05.087 --> 02:18:06.508]  It likes weak, dependent people.
[02:18:07.348 --> 02:18:19.135]  Yes, and I'm also a VFW member and a veteran of the Vietnam War era.
[02:18:19.575 --> 02:18:23.157]  I'm trying to get the VFW to come out from under this 503
[02:18:24.736 --> 02:18:31.198]  Yes, yes, and you know, and it's, it's, it's, you know, basically it's a, it's a, um, um,
[02:18:51.587 --> 02:18:54.168]  Trying to get rid of our First Amendment rights.
[02:18:55.029 --> 02:19:00.131]  Look, a virus or a bacteria likes to breed in a weak body.
[02:19:00.432 --> 02:19:03.153]  The globalists want to make you weak before they drink your blood.
[02:19:03.193 --> 02:19:03.553]  Go ahead.
[02:19:04.053 --> 02:19:10.597]  Yes, and you know, I went to that battle of Athens, Tennessee.
[02:19:11.597 --> 02:19:14.999]  To me, that's the way the VFW should react to this stuff.
[02:19:15.059 --> 02:19:18.881]  Not be combined to cages because of an illegal pact.
[02:19:20.220 --> 02:19:26.245]  Well, number one, even if you sign a 501c3 to be a charity, they misappropriate it.
[02:19:26.285 --> 02:19:28.326]  You're allowed to say I'm against gun control.
[02:19:28.706 --> 02:19:31.108]  You're allowed, as members, to say we're against open borders.
[02:19:31.408 --> 02:19:36.792]  They just tell you you're not allowed to talk about politics as a way to make sure all the veterans are controlled.
[02:19:37.153 --> 02:19:38.434]  They're the people you're afraid of.
[02:19:40.015 --> 02:19:40.515]  Exactly.
[02:19:41.056 --> 02:19:44.038]  That's my point, and I'm trying to wake at least my
[02:19:44.679 --> 02:19:48.443]  My post up to get out there and say enough's enough.
[02:19:49.223 --> 02:19:50.124]  Well, God bless you.
[02:19:50.144 --> 02:19:50.685]  Keep it up.
[02:19:51.105 --> 02:19:54.308]  But you guys already have the power to speak out freely as individual members.
[02:19:54.829 --> 02:19:57.471]  So just bypass that false psychological barrier.
[02:19:57.751 --> 02:19:58.332]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.332 --> 02:20:01.813]  Attention!
[02:20:02.013 --> 02:20:17.087]  An important product from hempusa.org, micro plant powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[02:20:17.367 --> 02:20:18.789]  Micro plant powder is 89% silica.
[02:20:20.350 --> 02:20:21.090]  We're good to go!
[02:20:46.657 --> 02:20:49.858]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:20:49.878 --> 02:20:52.119]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:20:52.159 --> 02:20:53.260]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:21:11.525 --> 02:21:14.206]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:14.966 --> 02:21:20.427]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:20.587 --> 02:21:25.628]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:25.648 --> 02:21:35.771]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:35.891 --> 02:21:37.992]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:38.232 --> 02:21:39.572]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:39.812 --> 02:21:42.113]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:42.273 --> 02:21:44.114]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:44.394 --> 02:21:49.196]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:49.556 --> 02:21:54.338]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:21:54.498 --> 02:21:58.659]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:00.575 --> 02:22:10.318]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:22:10.599 --> 02:22:16.641]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[02:22:17.041 --> 02:22:25.884]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:22:26.264 --> 02:22:35.172]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:22:35.452 --> 02:22:40.036]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[02:22:40.316 --> 02:22:41.597]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:41.858 --> 02:22:44.360]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:46.121]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:47.962 --> 02:22:51.784]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[02:22:52.144 --> 02:22:52.845]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:52.885 --> 02:22:53.225]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.689 --> 02:23:04.851]  Americans have heard much about change in recent times and are now waking up to the truth.
[02:23:05.091 --> 02:23:08.072]  Well, here's a few facts about your food you may want to change.
[02:23:08.232 --> 02:23:17.176]  Did you know that nearly 100% of the food on store shelves comes from a few corporations and that most is genetically engineered, chemically sprayed, and transported great distances
[02:23:17.176 --> 02:23:17.576]  I think so.
[02:23:36.613 --> 02:23:37.093]  We're good to go.
[02:24:20.876 --> 02:24:25.439]  News splits coming up in about T-minus 8 minutes when we start the next segment.
[02:24:25.479 --> 02:24:28.081]  Right now, let's try to go to your calls a little bit quicker now.
[02:24:28.502 --> 02:24:30.063]  Let's go to Joseph in California.
[02:24:30.083 --> 02:24:30.623]  You're on the air.
[02:24:30.663 --> 02:24:31.083]  Go ahead.
[02:24:31.103 --> 02:24:32.745]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:33.085 --> 02:24:35.707]  I just wanted to touch on two issues.
[02:24:35.867 --> 02:24:45.774]  One would be that it seems strange that you're mentioning about how the media is controlled, too, and I really think that it's something out of that movie they live every day.
[02:24:48.789 --> 02:24:53.972]  Second, also I was going to say, I think maybe you should do a whole segment or maybe even a movie on that.
[02:24:54.692 --> 02:24:59.014]  About just how insanely the media and the news is controlled.
[02:25:00.255 --> 02:25:03.797]  I've said for years I want to make a film about propaganda.
[02:25:05.998 --> 02:25:09.100]  And that's been my intention for more than 12 years.
[02:25:11.141 --> 02:25:13.842]  So yes, that is in the realm of the future.
[02:25:16.926 --> 02:25:27.232]  Yeah, because I know people that have taken marketing and sociology and they've said they've never even heard of Edward Bernays and he's like one of the most influential people of the propaganda.
[02:25:29.193 --> 02:25:42.140]  You know what, I think they must have gone and gotten the cheat sheets then because baseline marketing, baseline RTF teaches it out of the gates.
[02:25:44.864 --> 02:25:49.126]  Yeah, they're like on their second year and they have no clue who the guy is.
[02:25:50.467 --> 02:25:52.128]  But I mean, the same thing goes with Tesla.
[02:25:54.730 --> 02:25:55.530]  I hear you, Joseph.
[02:25:55.610 --> 02:25:56.491]  I appreciate your call.
[02:25:56.591 --> 02:25:58.072]  Ricky and Georgia, you're on the air.
[02:25:59.312 --> 02:26:00.093]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[02:26:00.433 --> 02:26:01.353]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:26:01.814 --> 02:26:02.514]  Welcome.
[02:26:02.954 --> 02:26:04.295]  I just had two quick points.
[02:26:04.795 --> 02:26:14.501]  One, for anybody who doubts the power of marketing control over us, especially over women, needs only look at how many times the mascara brush has been reinvented.
[02:26:16.153 --> 02:26:39.126]  And the main reason, idea to help in the mission to expose Glenn Beck for what he really is, given the success of the Joker poster and given your propensity for Batman references, another villain that I think fits the bill with Glenn Beck is Two-Face.
[02:26:40.147 --> 02:26:42.608]  And I thought of an image, I can't
[02:26:43.157 --> 02:26:45.459]  Draw, so otherwise I would have sent it to you.
[02:26:46.139 --> 02:26:54.506]  But, um, to do an image where it's Glenn Beck, and half of him is Glenn Beck, the other half is evil Two-Face, of course.
[02:26:55.206 --> 02:27:00.870]  He's flipping a coin, and the coin could, you know, say New World Order on it with the unfinished pyramid.
[02:27:01.471 --> 02:27:08.676]  And underneath the image, it says, heads we win, tails you lose.
[02:27:11.138 --> 02:27:12.379]  Just wanted to know what you thought about that.
[02:27:12.785 --> 02:27:13.605]  Very interesting.
[02:27:13.645 --> 02:27:16.386]  That's the power of graphic designers out there.
[02:27:16.726 --> 02:27:27.190]  And you go all over the internet, not just on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, but on mainline sites that are covering race car driving or gardening.
[02:27:27.610 --> 02:27:32.571]  You see people in the message boards talking about the New World Order and posting amazing graphics.
[02:27:34.312 --> 02:27:36.612]  We really are winning the culture war.
[02:27:36.632 --> 02:27:46.514]  I mean, I mentioned earlier how Newsday, one of the biggest media outfits in the country, went to subscription-based three weeks ago and only got 35 members.
[02:27:48.795 --> 02:27:53.655]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I can plug PrisonPlanet.tv one time and get 35 members.
[02:27:54.276 --> 02:27:55.056]  I mean, that's the point.
[02:27:55.276 --> 02:27:57.176]  No one supports these people.
[02:27:57.796 --> 02:27:59.056]  They are a paper tiger.
[02:27:59.076 --> 02:28:02.237]  And the big fraud is, to be in a major newspaper,
[02:28:04.286 --> 02:28:11.588]  Even something like the Statesman here in Austin, and to have a full-page ad in the back is $10,000 or more.
[02:28:12.709 --> 02:28:19.631]  And to have the equivalent ad and reach as many people on InfoWars.com, it'd be about $50.
[02:28:20.971 --> 02:28:26.553]  See, the last illusion to fall... I appreciate your call.
[02:28:26.573 --> 02:28:27.593]  Let me explain this this way.
[02:28:28.514 --> 02:28:32.315]  When I go on CNN or Fox, I get almost no response.
[02:28:33.385 --> 02:28:36.727]  In web traffic, video sales, anything we can gauge traffic by.
[02:28:36.747 --> 02:28:42.710]  I go on a mom and pop AM Christian radio station for an hour as a guest.
[02:28:43.430 --> 02:28:51.074]  Say the videos are free on the web, but if you want them in better quality and support me, buy the DVD at InfoWars.com and I might get 30, 40 orders.
[02:28:52.375 --> 02:28:54.796]  Some 1,000 watt in a little town.
[02:28:55.868 --> 02:29:03.295]  Because these are real humans that aren't mesmerized, tuning into radio, which hits a totally different area of the brain, where they're actually consciously engaged.
[02:29:03.596 --> 02:29:04.917]  TV watchers are zombies.
[02:29:08.100 --> 02:29:15.888]  And so that's what I'm trying to say is, you've got these big global corporations that patronize mainstream media to put their propaganda out.
[02:29:15.948 --> 02:29:18.030]  They know they're not getting the full return back.
[02:29:19.151 --> 02:29:19.552]  They know.
[02:29:21.001 --> 02:29:24.423]  I mean, some advertising's different, like watches or cars.
[02:29:24.823 --> 02:29:26.624]  They tend to actually get money back from it.
[02:29:26.925 --> 02:29:38.352]  But when you see Archer Daniels Midland or Monsanto ads telling you how great they are, or you see Lockheed Martin Marietta defense contractor ads, they're not selling F-111 stealth bombers to you.
[02:29:38.752 --> 02:29:41.193]  They're not selling GMO to the average person.
[02:29:41.473 --> 02:29:44.115]  They're just propagandizing and paying off the media.
[02:29:44.515 --> 02:29:45.056]  We'll be back.
[02:29:45.076 --> 02:29:45.496]  Stay with us.
[02:29:47.893 --> 02:29:50.877]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:50.897 --> 02:29:54.501]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.127 --> 02:30:02.748]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:03.088 --> 02:30:11.210]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:30:11.951 --> 02:30:15.992]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:30:16.572 --> 02:30:27.395]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:30:28.015 --> 02:30:37.018]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:37.518 --> 02:30:42.559]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:30:42.959 --> 02:30:50.141]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:50.441 --> 02:30:53.182]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:30:59.042 --> 02:31:02.689]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:03.069 --> 02:31:06.075]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:06.315 --> 02:31:07.738]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:31:08.436 --> 02:31:11.117]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:11.697 --> 02:31:17.339]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:17.499 --> 02:31:22.521]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:31:22.681 --> 02:31:32.665]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:31:32.785 --> 02:31:34.906]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:31:35.146 --> 02:31:36.466]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:36.726 --> 02:31:39.007]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:39.187 --> 02:31:41.027]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:31:41.307 --> 02:31:46.109]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:51.230]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:32:17.888 --> 02:32:18.289]  NoMoreMortgage.
[02:32:20.329 --> 02:32:21.550]  Where have they been all of our life?
[02:32:21.610 --> 02:32:24.052]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[02:32:24.112 --> 02:32:27.754]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[02:32:28.014 --> 02:32:30.116]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.

[02:32:51.130 --> 02:32:51.230]  800-578-6279.
[02:32:51.250 --> 02:32:51.630]  Big John.
[02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:52.051]  Big John.
[02:32:52.151 --> 02:32:54.933]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[02:32:55.073 --> 02:32:56.574]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[02:32:56.634 --> 02:33:05.220]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[02:33:05.300 --> 02:33:08.383]  And everybody knew you didn't give no lip to Big John.
[02:33:25.199 --> 02:33:26.801]  All right, we are back live.
[02:33:28.562 --> 02:33:31.466]  I'm in a news blitz now here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:33.234 --> 02:33:38.597]  I want to first tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's radio show possible, and I believe in all these sponsors.
[02:33:39.758 --> 02:33:41.559]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:33:42.299 --> 02:33:49.663]  We don't have to remind you that you need food to survive, and our great sponsor, eFoodsDirect, is the longest continually operating storable foods company in the country.
[02:33:49.683 --> 02:33:53.226]  They also happen to be true patriots and have supported the freedom movement for years and years.
[02:33:53.586 --> 02:33:56.828]  They have incredible lines of already prepared meals, raw meals.
[02:33:57.768 --> 02:34:02.731]  It is the place, and they produce their food every month, brand new, not some ten-year-old crud.
[02:34:03.091 --> 02:34:06.573]  A lot of people out there, you know, like to say they're the best.
[02:34:06.613 --> 02:34:07.834]  Well, this is the best I've found.
[02:34:07.854 --> 02:34:08.714]  This is the real deal.
[02:34:09.134 --> 02:34:13.277]  eFoodsDirect.com or give them a call at 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, or check out the big banners on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:21.681 --> 02:34:24.484]  Continuing, I want to tell you about survivalseedbank.com.
[02:34:24.905 --> 02:34:28.810]  Everybody should buy one of these, plant it this spring, but buy another and save it.
[02:34:29.130 --> 02:34:30.191]  Get good at gardening.
[02:34:30.552 --> 02:34:35.057]  The journey of a thousand miles, as the old Chinese proverb states, starts with a single step.
[02:34:35.438 --> 02:34:39.382]  And just getting back to gardening, turning the TV off a few hours a day on Saturday and Sunday,
[02:34:40.543 --> 02:34:45.546]  It's just a wonderful thing to do and to grow some non-hybrid, non-GMO seeds.
[02:34:46.066 --> 02:34:50.028]  The globalists are buying up all the little seed companies, hoarding it at UN facilities.
[02:34:50.068 --> 02:34:51.108]  People don't believe me about that.
[02:34:51.128 --> 02:34:51.989]  You can just Google it.
[02:34:52.009 --> 02:34:53.089]  It's like Reuters AP.
[02:34:53.109 --> 02:34:57.231]  In fact, pull up UN Seed Vault Arctic Circle.
[02:34:57.892 --> 02:34:59.112]  It'll be like a Reuters article.
[02:34:59.132 --> 02:35:02.294]  It'll show the new Secretary General touring it.
[02:35:03.935 --> 02:35:05.176]  Troops guarding it from you.
[02:35:05.497 --> 02:35:13.404]  The point is, survivalseedbank.com, 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[02:35:14.485 --> 02:35:21.371]  And last but not least, I want to tell you about Ecola Blue, the atmospheric water generator.
[02:35:21.411 --> 02:35:25.674]  Because of the overwhelming need in Haiti, they've already shipped one of their giant units over there.
[02:35:26.055 --> 02:35:28.417]  Ecola Blue is donating 20% of every Ecola Blue 28 and Ecola Blue 30 sold.
[02:35:31.275 --> 02:35:31.515]  I think?
[02:35:53.742 --> 02:35:55.505]  So every purchase you make, 20% goes to that.
[02:35:55.525 --> 02:35:57.707]  ColaBlue.com or give them a call at 800-691-6043.
[02:35:57.727 --> 02:35:59.369]  800-691-6043 or there's a big banner up on InfoWars.com.
[02:35:59.389 --> 02:35:59.469]  Okay!
[02:36:11.789 --> 02:36:13.951]  Health care is in deep trouble, can be beaten.
[02:36:13.971 --> 02:36:33.229]  We've got to put major heat on them to make sure that falls apart and let all the Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate know you're going to be voting against them and campaigning against them if they let the insurance companies and banks take over, raise taxes, put people in prison if they don't buy health care, control health care, water health care down, cut Medicare and Medicaid.
[02:36:33.829 --> 02:36:36.391]  That's one of the big final dominoes we haven't beaten.
[02:36:36.751 --> 02:36:38.672]  Geithner's on the verge of being kicked out.
[02:36:39.072 --> 02:36:40.973]  Bernanke may not get re-approved.
[02:36:41.033 --> 02:36:42.634]  Make sure you call Congress on that.
[02:36:43.174 --> 02:36:45.576]  Geithner was absolutely grilled along with Henry Paulson.
[02:36:45.596 --> 02:36:46.376]  They're both crooks.
[02:36:46.817 --> 02:36:47.717]  They need to go to prison.
[02:36:49.578 --> 02:36:51.960]  And I covered that in the first hour of the show in detail.
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:55.722]  If you missed it, the retransmission's coming up in T-minus 24 minutes.
[02:36:57.423 --> 02:36:59.904]  Getting into other news that I've not yet covered.
[02:36:59.924 --> 02:37:02.826]  I mentioned this, but I want to get into it more right now.
[02:37:04.565 --> 02:37:08.048]  Send California inmates to Mexico, says Schwarzenegger.
[02:37:09.069 --> 02:37:22.782]  Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger suggested Californians could ease its crowded prison system, half of their system's full of illegal aliens, by sending thousands of undocumented inmates to specially built jails in Mexico.
[02:37:23.817 --> 02:37:28.120]  And then he goes on to say that California would pay for the prisons.
[02:37:28.140 --> 02:37:32.122]  Well, they're already set up a North American Hemispheric ID card that you can get right now.
[02:37:32.562 --> 02:37:35.144]  They're already merging the security and police apparatus.
[02:37:35.544 --> 02:37:41.708]  This was talked about in the SPP documents from 2007, 2006, and 2005.
[02:37:42.429 --> 02:37:49.073]  And so, how about we take the illegal aliens and bus them up to the border and order the Mexicans to take them?
[02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:57.267]  The criminals in Mexico, the people fleeing, the bank robbers, the murderers, the rapists, the arsonists, the crazies.
[02:37:59.149 --> 02:38:01.271]  Imagine if Mexico would take all U.S.
[02:38:01.311 --> 02:38:01.712]  criminals.
[02:38:02.773 --> 02:38:04.114]  People would then run to Mexico.
[02:38:04.154 --> 02:38:10.081]  And in the past, gringos could run down to Mexico, and that's where criminals went.
[02:38:10.121 --> 02:38:10.961]  Well, it's the same thing.
[02:38:14.488 --> 02:38:19.091]  That's what's happening is that all these criminals and others are coming up here and then we have to pay for it.
[02:38:19.631 --> 02:38:22.653]  And we also have to get mugged and killed and robbed and looted.
[02:38:23.474 --> 02:38:27.597]  And every major Californian city is a sanctuary city like Austin, Texas.
[02:38:27.897 --> 02:38:29.458]  They don't get arrested for DWI.
[02:38:29.778 --> 02:38:31.219]  They don't get arrested for no ID.
[02:38:31.479 --> 02:38:32.480]  They're told leave it alone.
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:35.062]  But citizens are thrown to the wolves.
[02:38:35.602 --> 02:38:36.763]  Citizens are arrested.
[02:38:38.224 --> 02:38:39.865]  I mean, our city is completely lawless.
[02:38:43.194 --> 02:38:53.496]  Speaking to reporters, the Sacramento Press Club, Schwarzenegger, said California could ease its strained finance by billions of dollars if 20,000 illegal immigrants currently held in the state were housed across the border.
[02:38:53.876 --> 02:39:04.699]  I think we can do some better if the prison system alone, if we can go and take inmates, for instance, 20,000 inmates that are illegal immigrants, that are held here and get them to Mexico.
[02:39:05.379 --> 02:39:05.919]  Think about it.
[02:39:06.159 --> 02:39:06.880]  Think about it.
[02:39:07.260 --> 02:39:14.363]  If California gives Mexico the money, not, hey, you take care of them, these are your citizens.
[02:39:14.463 --> 02:39:15.823]  No, no, not at all.
[02:39:17.244 --> 02:39:18.044]  The guy's retarded.
[02:39:18.104 --> 02:39:18.704]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:39:19.605 --> 02:39:22.866]  We pay them to build the prison down in Mexico.
[02:39:23.766 --> 02:39:29.028]  And then, then, then, then, we have those undocumented immigrants down there in prison.
[02:39:29.048 --> 02:39:30.029]  Yeah, I'm sure that's going to happen.
[02:39:30.859 --> 02:39:34.762]  It would half the cost to build the prison and run the prison.
[02:39:35.162 --> 02:39:37.323]  We could save a billion dollars.
[02:39:37.944 --> 02:39:38.604]  Write that.
[02:39:38.724 --> 02:39:40.926]  Could go into higher education.
[02:39:41.626 --> 02:39:41.846]  Yes.
[02:39:42.287 --> 02:39:43.167]  Brainwash the kids more.
[02:39:43.187 --> 02:39:43.688]  That's what we need.
[02:39:43.708 --> 02:39:45.629]  The more money they spend, the dumber they get.
[02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:48.371]  So, I mean, that's just the type of crud.
[02:39:50.072 --> 02:39:52.914]  We don't dare ship illegal criminals out.
[02:39:53.094 --> 02:39:53.494]  No.
[02:39:53.514 --> 02:39:53.554]  No.
[02:39:53.895 --> 02:39:54.295]  No.
[02:39:54.315 --> 02:39:54.355]  No.
[02:39:54.735 --> 02:39:55.055]  No.
[02:39:57.955 --> 02:40:08.146]  I mean, instantly, they could say, we're not accepting your consular matriculus, we're not letting your illegals wire 50 plus billion home a year, if you don't take criminals and pay for it yourself.
[02:40:13.191 --> 02:40:19.118]  But the globalists love butchering America, so they're going to continue to let the entire third world criminal mass move here.
[02:40:20.765 --> 02:40:28.507]  And then they're going to, you're going to vote for more police, and then they're going to be there to feed off you and write you tickets, and if they pull an illegal over by accident, I just go ahead and go.
[02:40:28.527 --> 02:40:31.047]  You can go ahead and go now.
[02:40:31.067 --> 02:40:38.489]  I already mentioned airlines suffered record drop in traffic in 2009 because of the naked body scanners and other things.
[02:40:38.509 --> 02:40:39.249]  People are sick of it.
[02:40:39.609 --> 02:40:43.070]  Dying news media looks to Apple tablet for hope.
[02:40:44.158 --> 02:40:50.704]  They think now that because they'll have an Apple tablet that people carry around that suddenly they're going to want to read the mainstream newspapers or subscribe.
[02:40:51.164 --> 02:40:55.208]  Well, that is disproven by this little gem that I want to spend some more time on.
[02:40:55.228 --> 02:40:56.769]  Then I'm going to get some news I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:40:56.789 --> 02:40:59.691]  Let me get a close shot on this document, Cam.
[02:41:00.432 --> 02:41:04.375]  After three months, only 35 subscriptions for Newsday website.
[02:41:04.796 --> 02:41:08.179]  Again, another giant hoax is that
[02:41:12.199 --> 02:41:14.541]  The newspapers are falling apart because of the internet.
[02:41:14.601 --> 02:41:14.801]  No.
[02:41:15.101 --> 02:41:15.282]  No.
[02:41:15.642 --> 02:41:16.763]  That's a small part of it.
[02:41:17.624 --> 02:41:23.128]  It's because people are sick of you and your distortions and they don't want to support you.
[02:41:23.849 --> 02:41:26.531]  There are alternative newspapers doing gangbusters.
[02:41:26.591 --> 02:41:29.133]  People will pay for something they trust.
[02:41:29.494 --> 02:41:30.755]  For something that's informative.
[02:41:30.795 --> 02:41:33.157]  They will not pay for crud.
[02:41:34.226 --> 02:41:36.687]  People will pay for a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[02:41:36.927 --> 02:41:40.227]  They got all the films, my book, Watson's book, the live-streaming TV show.
[02:41:40.548 --> 02:41:41.808]  They understand what this costs.
[02:41:42.128 --> 02:41:43.088]  They know what we're doing.
[02:41:43.128 --> 02:41:44.108]  They want to support us.
[02:41:44.168 --> 02:41:45.209]  They know what we're doing is good.
[02:41:46.289 --> 02:41:47.889]  They are not going to support you.
[02:41:47.909 --> 02:41:51.490]  35 subscribers.
[02:41:51.510 --> 02:41:51.490]  30.
[02:41:51.650 --> 02:41:54.291]  Newsday is gigantic.
[02:41:55.646 --> 02:41:59.970]  I mean, I've looked at the statistics, but it's got to be in the top 15 or so media outlets in the country.
[02:42:00.010 --> 02:42:03.453]  I know it's the biggest thing in New York, the third most populous state.
[02:42:03.913 --> 02:42:05.214]  I mean, it is just giant.
[02:42:05.514 --> 02:42:09.157]  And they can't get 35 subscriptions.
[02:42:09.178 --> 02:42:11.299]  They've got thousands of employees.
[02:42:11.740 --> 02:42:14.422]  You'd think they'd want subscriptions to be able to read what's on there.
[02:42:14.562 --> 02:42:16.684]  I guess they already get them.
[02:42:16.704 --> 02:42:16.684]  35!
[02:42:16.724 --> 02:42:18.265]  I mean, that is incredible.
[02:42:18.646 --> 02:42:19.746]  And by the way, Newsday,
[02:42:20.925 --> 02:42:23.287]  is one of the better mainstream publications.
[02:42:23.827 --> 02:42:30.693]  I mean, they exposed how the CPS was taking kids in New York and giving them to chemical firms to test pesticides on them until they killed them.
[02:42:31.113 --> 02:42:32.154]  That was four or five years ago.
[02:42:32.174 --> 02:42:34.015]  I mean, I've actually seen some good reporting on a news day.
[02:42:39.113 --> 02:42:49.436]  It's overall not a good thing, though, that the newspapers are completely imploding, because the government's saying they're going to come in now with government information and government newspapers and government sites and government bailouts, i.e.
[02:42:49.456 --> 02:42:50.376]  taking over the newspapers.
[02:42:50.856 --> 02:42:58.578]  In late October, Newsday, the Long Island Daily, that the Dolans bought for $650 million, put its website, Newsday.com, behind a paywall.
[02:42:59.358 --> 02:43:04.802]  The paper was one of the first non-business newspapers to take the plunge by putting up a paywall.
[02:43:05.442 --> 02:43:08.184]  So, in media circles, it has been followed with interest.
[02:43:08.684 --> 02:43:12.647]  Could its fate be a sign of what others, including the New York Times, might expect?
[02:43:12.667 --> 02:43:16.790]  The New York Times has done okay with subscription.
[02:43:17.710 --> 02:43:18.771]  Part of their stuff is subscription.
[02:43:19.191 --> 02:43:20.072]  That's the way to do it.
[02:43:20.132 --> 02:43:24.895]  And I never... I discovered all this instinctively.
[02:43:24.995 --> 02:43:25.516]  I just thought...
[02:43:26.801 --> 02:43:33.105]  I want to give everything away for free, but I can't afford it, so we'll have premium stuff for people that will pay.
[02:43:34.246 --> 02:43:37.928]  But I wanted to just get out to people so we were successful because we have the big audience.
[02:43:43.211 --> 02:43:51.096]  So, three months later, how many people have signed up to pay $5 a week or $260 a year to get unfettered access to Newsday?
[02:43:51.556 --> 02:43:54.478]  Well, I mean, Newsday, these executives know nothing.
[02:43:56.121 --> 02:43:59.004]  People will not pay $260 for your newspaper.
[02:43:59.164 --> 02:44:02.427]  If it was $595 for a year, you would have gotten probably 10,000 members.
[02:44:10.734 --> 02:44:16.735]  If you would have made it simple to do, where somebody just got a membership off their cell phone by texting, and then they get the code back.
[02:44:16.755 --> 02:44:17.676]  We're trying to move to that.
[02:44:17.976 --> 02:44:19.376]  I mean, believe me, I know how to innovate.
[02:44:20.796 --> 02:44:28.218]  If I could just get my basic management going and get the funding, the sky's the limit if plans I had three years ago would have been launched.
[02:44:29.118 --> 02:44:30.539]  I mean, and I'm not complaining.
[02:44:31.159 --> 02:44:34.280]  It's just hard to manage things, especially when you're working all the time.
[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:37.640]  I'm on Russia Today, radio interviews, you know, just endless work.
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:38.881]  Gotta see my family.
[02:44:40.970 --> 02:44:44.452]  But I know what to implement for us to even be, you know, we're kicking their butt.
[02:44:44.492 --> 02:44:49.935]  But I mean, I could just annihilate them if I would have made myself three, four years ago, crack the whip and do what I needed to be done.
[02:44:50.156 --> 02:44:51.356]  But I don't like expanding.
[02:44:51.416 --> 02:44:54.498]  I don't like having to hustle for more money to fund myself.
[02:44:54.558 --> 02:44:58.681]  But I know that that is what must be done if we're really going to beat these people.
[02:44:58.721 --> 02:45:01.703]  But Newsday, here's a message.
[02:45:01.783 --> 02:45:02.743]  Make it $4, $5, no more than $10.
[02:45:02.783 --> 02:45:03.424]  People might subscribe.
[02:45:08.464 --> 02:45:09.965]  I forgot to turn my phone off, guys.
[02:45:11.185 --> 02:45:12.446]  It's in here ding-donging.
[02:45:13.166 --> 02:45:15.067]  Here, let me see who's calling.
[02:45:15.888 --> 02:45:16.768]  I'll answer it on air.
[02:45:18.149 --> 02:45:19.429]  I have no idea who this is.
[02:45:20.790 --> 02:45:21.690]  Here, let's see who it is.
[02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.611]  Hello?
[02:45:25.392 --> 02:45:25.972]  Who's this?
[02:45:28.874 --> 02:45:29.934]  Dean Haglin!
[02:45:30.294 --> 02:45:31.855]  I thought I needed to answer the phone.
[02:45:32.095 --> 02:45:33.576]  You know, I'm live on the radio, bro.
[02:45:38.584 --> 02:45:41.465]  Yeah, no, I added an hour to the show about a year ago, sure.
[02:45:42.026 --> 02:45:43.987]  Hey, what's going on, bro?
[02:45:51.930 --> 02:45:54.332]  Absolutely, I'd like to have you in studio if you're coming to town.
[02:45:57.413 --> 02:45:59.074]  What do we have open on Friday, producers?
[02:46:02.150 --> 02:46:04.051]  It's funny, I never answer calls on air.
[02:46:04.851 --> 02:46:08.772]  One time Charlie Sheen called me and I answered it on air, but... What time?
[02:46:08.792 --> 02:46:13.213]  Hey, how about you come in for an hour on Friday?
[02:46:16.935 --> 02:46:24.777]  Well listen, let me hand the phone off to Jaron or Matt Ryan or one of my producers and then we'll give you our new address and let me get you in studio, man.
[02:46:27.264 --> 02:46:28.025]  Take care, buddy.
[02:46:28.746 --> 02:46:29.267]  Don't hang up.
[02:46:29.307 --> 02:46:29.868]  Here's Jaron.
[02:46:29.888 --> 02:46:30.749]  Here's Jaron Neihart.
[02:46:31.670 --> 02:46:31.870]  Thanks.
[02:46:35.578 --> 02:46:36.058]  That's funny.
[02:46:36.498 --> 02:46:40.080]  Dean Hagelin, star of X-Files and Lone Gunman and a lot of other movies and films.
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:44.421]  Remember, he came and told us about how the CIA was telling him what to do in their scripts.
[02:46:45.102 --> 02:46:55.726]  They ran, six months before 9-11, a piece on the Lone Gunman, where the government hijacks a plane to fly it into the World Trade Center to get martial law and attack Afghanistan.
[02:46:56.166 --> 02:47:04.469]  And they use drills to make NORAD stand down and the rest of the military to stand down during the attack, because the rest of the military obviously doesn't know it's a staged event.
[02:47:06.348 --> 02:47:09.432]  And the good old CIA just wanted the people to hear that.
[02:47:09.532 --> 02:47:11.134]  What is their problem?
[02:47:11.234 --> 02:47:13.116]  They're psychopaths.
[02:47:13.837 --> 02:47:15.620]  They like to throw this in your face.
[02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:23.169]  Maybe that could be a new thing where I just have the phone here and we like patch it into the microphones and make calls.
[02:47:23.209 --> 02:47:23.610]  Hold on.
[02:47:23.630 --> 02:47:24.951]  Hey, yeah, what's up?
[02:47:25.692 --> 02:47:26.772]  I could really multitask.
[02:47:26.792 --> 02:47:30.114]  You know, we're already setting up guest on air and already doing research on air.
[02:47:30.134 --> 02:47:32.355]  I mean, you get to see the sausage making here.
[02:47:32.415 --> 02:47:42.879]  You get to see the blood, the guts, the whole process here, or the candy making, or the wine making, stomping on the grapes, whatever parallel analogy that you want to use.
[02:47:42.919 --> 02:47:44.440]  Okay, let me get into real news blitzing now.
[02:47:44.460 --> 02:47:45.260]  I got stuck on that.
[02:47:48.971 --> 02:47:50.192]  Man, there is so much here.
[02:47:50.912 --> 02:47:51.672]  So much here.
[02:47:52.073 --> 02:47:53.213]  Where's that key stack?
[02:47:53.253 --> 02:47:54.294]  I had a key stack.
[02:47:55.334 --> 02:47:55.854]  Oh, here it is.
[02:47:55.874 --> 02:48:01.217]  You know, this happened a few days ago.
[02:48:01.317 --> 02:48:03.018]  Paul Watson wrote about it yesterday.
[02:48:03.398 --> 02:48:06.680]  Potential false flag to be blamed on Muslims foiled.
[02:48:07.981 --> 02:48:10.102]  Prisonplanet.com.
[02:48:11.843 --> 02:48:17.846]  And it says, Navy vet caught with grenade launcher, maps of military bases, and Arab headdress.
[02:48:20.353 --> 02:48:22.775]  And then Watson goes through how it's obviously a false flag.
[02:48:22.795 --> 02:48:23.716]  It has every earmark.
[02:48:24.336 --> 02:48:28.260]  I mean, sometimes when you look out on the lake and you see a duck, it's a decoy.
[02:48:28.640 --> 02:48:30.662]  Somebody who was duck hunting left it out in the lake.
[02:48:31.162 --> 02:48:32.903]  But generally you see a duck, it's a duck.
[02:48:35.009 --> 02:48:39.832]  This might one out of a thousand not be a staged event, but we see it swimming around out there.
[02:48:39.872 --> 02:48:40.652]  It's probably on a decoy.
[02:48:42.173 --> 02:48:47.536]  Remember 2005 in Iraq?
[02:48:47.696 --> 02:48:52.579]  British Special Air Services get caught dressed up like Muslims running around shooting at military and police.
[02:48:53.339 --> 02:48:55.921]  And then they captured him and it came out it was a staged terror attack.
[02:48:56.482 --> 02:49:03.949]  And remember Ray McGovern on the show, top CIA analyst, when it came out that our government blew up the Golden Mosque to get the Shiites and Sunnis killing each other again.
[02:49:03.969 --> 02:49:08.133]  So they could then say, oh look, we put down the uprisings and let her declare victory.
[02:49:10.365 --> 02:49:15.170]  Uh, and every other provocative action, people end up calling it in and it gets stopped.
[02:49:15.811 --> 02:49:26.242]  A possible false flag terror attack to be blamed on Muslims has been foiled after a Navy vet was busted with a grenade launcher, assault rifles and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, as well as Arab headdresses.
[02:49:26.683 --> 02:49:27.904]  But he isn't a Muslim and...
[02:49:30.005 --> 02:49:31.146]  I didn't have the beer or any of it.
[02:49:31.506 --> 02:49:35.968]  In New Jersey yesterday, initial media reports speculated that the man was planning a terror attack on a U.S.
[02:49:35.988 --> 02:49:36.948]  military base in the area.
[02:49:37.389 --> 02:49:54.396]  Lloyd Woodson, 43, whose last known address was Reston, Virginia, today faces multiple offenses, including second-degree unlawful weapons possession and fourth-degree possession of prohibited weapons, Somerset County Prosecutor Wayne Forrest said.
[02:49:55.016 --> 02:49:56.977]  There's about a 5% chance he's just crazy.
[02:49:57.777 --> 02:49:59.718]  Or that it's a set-up, but it looks bad.
[02:50:02.339 --> 02:50:05.761]  Brockburg police confronted Woodson at 3.55 a.m.
[02:50:05.821 --> 02:50:10.623]  at the Quick Check convenience store on Route 28 for receiving a call reporting a suspicious person.
[02:50:10.643 --> 02:50:11.683]  See, local police stopped it.
[02:50:12.844 --> 02:50:23.069]  Brockenburg patrolman Steve Krontz noticed a large bulge beneath the green military-style jacket that Woodson was wearing, which was later determined to be an assault rifle with a
[02:50:23.869 --> 02:50:25.451]  The man may have had plans to attack a U.S.
[02:50:25.471 --> 02:50:27.512]  military base, and it goes on from there.
[02:50:27.572 --> 02:50:29.854]  We're going to come back in the final segment with more news blitz.
[02:50:49.401 --> 02:50:50.782]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:51.502 --> 02:50:52.163]  Stay the course.
[02:50:52.243 --> 02:50:53.283]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:50:53.303 --> 02:50:56.766]  Then I break down in great detail the Geithner situation.
[02:50:56.926 --> 02:50:57.246]  It's key.
[02:50:58.729 --> 02:50:59.209]  Hi, neighbor.
[02:50:59.529 --> 02:51:02.251]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[02:51:02.831 --> 02:51:07.553]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[02:51:08.113 --> 02:51:13.235]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[02:51:13.856 --> 02:51:20.939]  We would intend not to be standing in the breadline with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[02:51:21.459 --> 02:51:26.341]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the breadline may have no bread.
[02:51:26.977 --> 02:51:33.999]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[02:51:34.779 --> 02:51:39.221]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[02:51:39.901 --> 02:51:40.181]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:51:40.201 --> 02:51:40.241]  800-409-5633.
[02:51:40.281 --> 02:51:41.241]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:51:41.261 --> 02:51:41.462]  Who am I?
[02:51:41.482 --> 02:51:42.042]  Someone who cares.
[02:51:58.903 --> 02:52:02.529]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:02.930 --> 02:52:05.935]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:06.175 --> 02:52:07.598]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:08.303 --> 02:52:10.964]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:10.984 --> 02:52:17.186]  They have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:17.366 --> 02:52:22.408]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:22.548 --> 02:52:25.709]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:52:25.729 --> 02:52:32.531]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:32.651 --> 02:52:34.772]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:34.992 --> 02:52:36.333]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:36.593 --> 02:52:38.874]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:39.055 --> 02:52:40.875]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:40.895 --> 02:52:45.958]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:46.318 --> 02:52:55.443]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:57.611 --> 02:52:59.272]  We all need to prepare ourselves.
[02:52:59.512 --> 02:53:04.254]  You might have the food, water, gold and silver, but ask yourself, are you truly prepared?
[02:53:04.694 --> 02:53:07.135]  That's why you need to visit MaineMilitary.com.
[02:53:07.515 --> 02:53:09.896]  MaineMilitary.com carries everything you need.
[02:53:10.056 --> 02:53:14.018]  Gas masks, wool blankets, fire starter kits, high-capacity magazines.
[02:53:14.418 --> 02:53:17.420]  Chemical suits, military surplus items, and much more.
[02:53:17.821 --> 02:53:18.861]  Do you own a firearm?
[02:53:19.202 --> 02:53:23.265]  MaineMilitary.com has a large selection of pistols and rifles suited for your needs.
[02:53:23.725 --> 02:53:25.707]  Are your local stores sold out of ammunition?
[02:53:26.087 --> 02:53:30.190]  Call or visit them today for prices on hard-to-find ammo and bulk ammo orders.
[02:53:30.450 --> 02:53:39.177]  You don't need to worry about having a military surplus store in your area, because MaineMilitary.com is the only store you'll ever need, all from the comfort of your computer.
[02:53:39.577 --> 02:53:42.419]  Visit them online today at MaineMilitary.com.
[02:53:42.539 --> 02:53:45.481]  That's Maine, like the state, Military.com.
[02:53:45.841 --> 02:53:46.522]  Or call them at 1-877-608-0179.
[02:53:46.542 --> 02:53:46.802]  That's 1-877-608-0179.
[02:54:01.693 --> 02:54:03.855]  I really appreciate Darwin Bedecker.
[02:54:03.875 --> 02:54:09.281]  I really twisted his arm to come to the protest on Monday to get him up here from San Antonio.
[02:54:10.162 --> 02:54:16.067]  And he wanted me on air right now to thank all my listeners that came out to that event and made it such a success.
[02:54:19.050 --> 02:54:20.152]  He gave me some good news.
[02:54:21.488 --> 02:54:34.695]  He is in the Target Center, which isn't as big, but is almost as big, the 20th and 21st at Exit 228 and William Cannon I-35 on the 20th and 21st of next month.
[02:54:35.195 --> 02:54:40.038]  Now, I'm going to be there, and I hope you're going to be there, because the feds are going to be trying stuff.
[02:54:40.058 --> 02:54:42.980]  We're going to have to try to run a counter sting on them with their set-ups.
[02:54:43.940 --> 02:54:46.662]  And expose their criminal activity.
[02:54:46.762 --> 02:54:47.382]  They're not done.
[02:54:47.422 --> 02:54:49.224]  They're going to try to run us out of there.
[02:54:49.944 --> 02:54:52.906]  And as the governor said, that will show a clear pattern of criminal activity.
[02:54:53.947 --> 02:54:55.448]  Of intimidation and racketeering.
[02:54:56.128 --> 02:54:57.009]  But they're not going to stop.
[02:54:57.029 --> 02:54:58.129]  They think this is their town.
[02:54:58.149 --> 02:55:00.191]  They think the people of Austin belong to them.
[02:55:00.391 --> 02:55:03.973]  That is the city council, the ATF, and the police leadership.
[02:55:04.053 --> 02:55:06.074]  The average cop out there is disgusted by this.
[02:55:06.555 --> 02:55:09.457]  The reason I know is my dad came to the protest and I didn't notice him.
[02:55:10.759 --> 02:55:14.041]  Because the whole time I was there, I had like COINTELPRO poking me and getting in my face.
[02:55:14.462 --> 02:55:22.587]  And I'm sure some of them were, because later I found out about a meeting afterwards, which some people we know are connected to some operations about how they want to get me and go after me.
[02:55:22.607 --> 02:55:25.629]  It's a whole other subject, but it borders on illegal.
[02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:30.573]  But luckily, we had people inside who found out about that and called me about it.
[02:55:30.733 --> 02:55:31.493]  But separate issue.
[02:55:31.874 --> 02:55:37.758]  Anytime you come out for the Second Amendment, you're going to have disruptors who are going to try to spin things and do that.
[02:55:38.058 --> 02:55:39.239]  But they failed miserably.
[02:55:39.519 --> 02:55:40.581]  But my dad was there.
[02:55:40.781 --> 02:55:41.662]  I didn't know that.
[02:55:42.442 --> 02:55:43.543]  I didn't understand that.
[02:55:44.524 --> 02:55:50.110]  And he said he was walking up, and he was in a sports jacket and stuff, so he was clean cut.
[02:55:50.130 --> 02:55:56.876]  The cops talked to him, and he looks distinguished, and he went up to their cars, people at the parking garage, and he was giving them the law.
[02:55:57.657 --> 02:56:00.279]  That there's no law against private sale of firearms.
[02:56:00.319 --> 02:56:02.200]  The police said, we know, we know it's bull.
[02:56:02.620 --> 02:56:04.961]  And one of them held up his BlackBerry that actually had the law on it.
[02:56:04.981 --> 02:56:07.363]  He goes, yes, we all know it's a load of baloney.
[02:56:07.943 --> 02:56:13.746]  And so every cop he talked to was, my dad was nice and came over, was, yes, we know it's baloney.
[02:56:13.866 --> 02:56:14.607]  Yes, we know.
[02:56:14.827 --> 02:56:15.607]  Yes, we know.
[02:56:15.747 --> 02:56:16.167]  We know.
[02:56:16.588 --> 02:56:18.489]  Well, what are you doing?
[02:56:18.549 --> 02:56:21.170]  The police union should be saying they don't want to be part of this.
[02:56:23.635 --> 02:56:27.198]  I remember when we used to go out and bullhorn the Million Mom March.
[02:56:27.238 --> 02:56:32.704]  It would be more like the 20 Bureaucrat March and they would have people there trying to stir stuff up and get in my face.
[02:56:32.844 --> 02:56:33.765]  It doesn't stop me.
[02:56:34.305 --> 02:56:35.266]  Nothing stops me.
[02:56:35.947 --> 02:56:36.667]  Short of a bullet.
[02:56:37.108 --> 02:56:39.510]  That's God's will whether or not that happens.
[02:56:43.069 --> 02:56:48.651]  It's just absolutely amazing to see the people of America rising up and standing up.
[02:56:48.951 --> 02:56:53.472]  And the police were there to intimidate people in the windows, taking photos of people for their intelligence files.
[02:56:54.112 --> 02:57:02.775]  And some of my crew saw it, and reportedly we've got the video, we just have to dump it to the computer to watch it, of snipers on the roof.
[02:57:03.435 --> 02:57:07.057]  But it wasn't as bad as Waco, when I went up there and protested the Ku Klux Klan.
[02:57:07.937 --> 02:57:09.617]  They had provocateurs there as well.
[02:57:13.086 --> 02:57:22.230]  There were hundreds of people protesting the Klan, probably 300, 400, and I turned around and the police were in the parking garage, and I was wearing a t-shirt, obviously no weapon.
[02:57:23.571 --> 02:57:25.851]  They had me trained in their sights.
[02:57:25.872 --> 02:57:27.832]  You know, when you look at a gun, you see it's aimed right at you.
[02:57:27.852 --> 02:57:33.335]  I mean, the guy was 100 yards away up in the parking garage across the street, trained on me.
[02:57:34.755 --> 02:57:35.776]  Trained on me.
[02:57:36.956 --> 02:57:38.317]  And then Mike Hanson, he was with me.
[02:57:39.580 --> 02:57:46.744]  And it was just a horrible thing to witness that going on.
[02:57:50.206 --> 02:57:57.310]  Okay, continuing here with some of the other news, here to close out this radio broadcast.
[02:57:57.971 --> 02:58:00.932]  I've got so much, I'm trying to pick the most important here at the end, I'm running out of time.
[02:58:03.046 --> 02:58:06.710]  I meant to play this video, but it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:58:07.090 --> 02:58:12.056]  Congressman Mitts, we're told not to call it another stimulus bill, calling it a jobs bill.
[02:58:12.416 --> 02:58:13.437]  It's another banker bailout.
[02:58:13.457 --> 02:58:15.780]  They're going to call it a jobs bill.
[02:58:16.461 --> 02:58:22.367]  And we have the congressman up there talking about how they've been told that
[02:58:24.119 --> 02:58:25.740]  Lie to the people again for another hoax.
[02:58:26.601 --> 02:58:31.904]  I cover the implosion of the Federal Reserve and the criminal bankers and how this could bring them down if we get the word out.
[02:58:32.304 --> 02:58:34.085]  Coming up in the next hour of retransmission.
[02:58:34.405 --> 02:58:35.146]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:35.166 --> 02:58:36.266]  Don't forget the podcast.
[02:58:36.547 --> 02:58:37.327]  Great job, crew.
[02:58:37.787 --> 02:58:42.890]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:43.511 --> 02:58:46.773]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:48.554 --> 02:58:50.555]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to terror.
