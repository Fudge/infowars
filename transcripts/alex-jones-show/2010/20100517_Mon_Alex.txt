[00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:04.512]  We have reached the waypoint, the halfway point.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.083]  Waypoint, the point of no return in this radio broadcast today.
[00:00:21.103 --> 00:00:24.687]  It is Monday, the 17th day of May, 2010.
[00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:27.249]  Max Keiser coming up in just a few minutes.
[00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.394]  He normally joins us once a month, but he was on last week because of all the market situations.
[00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:37.160]  Now a lot of other analysts agree with him that it was a market terrorism, market manipulation.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.441]  With a thousand point drop, it's down over a hundred points right now.
[00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:42.261]  Open talk of the Euro imploding.
[00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:49.263]  We're going to discuss it all with Max Keiser and take your calls on the economy and other issues with Max coming up in this hour.
[00:00:49.444 --> 00:00:52.825]  And we are live at PrisonPlanet.tv, now simulcasting the second half.
[00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:56.186]  But Randy is calling in saying he works with the U.S.
[00:00:56.226 --> 00:00:59.607]  military in Germany and he was saying they're really waking up.
[00:00:59.627 --> 00:01:01.347]  We're hearing the military call in in mass.
[00:01:01.807 --> 00:01:04.008]  Talk about how they're listening to my show all over the bases.
[00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:12.055]  Now we've got troops coming out and going public up at Infowars.com with Oath Keepers about how there was a revolt in Katrina, refusing to confiscate guns.
[00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:14.677]  Tyranny comes to your door in a uniform.
[00:01:14.957 --> 00:01:18.901]  And if you can educate the people in uniform, the globalists won't be able to carry this out.
[00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:28.149]  And I've seen major news reports about how the NSA is mainly watching troops and FBI now, not just citizens like myself, because they know
[00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:29.690]  There's a huge awakening.
[00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:39.555]  Describe for us, Randy, the type of awakening going on over in Germany, in the military, in the government people over there, and other key points you said you wish you had time to cover.
[00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:42.076]  Well, there's a lot of different things.
[00:01:42.116 --> 00:01:44.877]  For example, I mean, I have bumper stickers, you know, in the Fed.
[00:01:45.758 --> 00:01:46.718]  I support Ron Paul.
[00:01:46.918 --> 00:01:48.039]  Bumper stickers, things like that.
[00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.861]  And a lot of people, they'll come up and ask me, what does that mean, in the Fed?
[00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:53.502]  And it blows my mind.
[00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:54.162]  It really does.
[00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:58.244]  These are, you know, majors, colonels, lieutenant colonels and stuff, have no idea.
[00:01:58.757 --> 00:02:09.741]  And I explain it to them, and I tell them, like, go to your websites, go to these in-the-Fed websites, check out Ron Paul's websites, read these books, read these tapes, and you'll wake up.
[00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:11.421]  Like, I had no idea.
[00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:12.982]  I had no idea.
[00:02:13.706 --> 00:02:23.517]  And by the way, I hope they don't try to persecute you and others that are spreading the word because in national polls, over 80% of Americans want to audit or abolish the Fed.
[00:02:23.758 --> 00:02:25.820]  It was 75% just three months ago.
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.022]  And so you're with the American people.
[00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:32.488]  It's your right to be for auditing this private secretive bank that's been robbing us.
[00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.609]  That's right.
[00:02:35.548 --> 00:02:40.771]  You know, on the economy and stuff, because I live in Germany, so I'm kind of, you know, involved in the economy stuff over here.
[00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:45.254]  I don't know where all this bailout money is going to come from that they're helping Greece and everything else out.
[00:02:46.415 --> 00:02:52.179]  A lot of people, you know, in America, you know, we fight taxes and everything else for good reason.
[00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:59.163]  Because over here, your sales tax, for example, is 19% on everything you buy.
[00:02:59.183 --> 00:03:00.804]  You tax your TV.
[00:03:01.185 --> 00:03:03.006]  They give you a church tax.
[00:03:03.556 --> 00:03:10.467]  If you go down and stay in certain hotels and stuff, around the Alps, they tax the air, the water, they tax everything.
[00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:12.630]  These folks are taxed to death!
[00:03:14.456 --> 00:03:17.277]  And now the Germans have been told, by the way the U.S.
[00:03:17.317 --> 00:03:20.580]  is paying for part of it, that they've got to give up more of their pension funds.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.241]  The Greeks have been told this.
[00:03:22.861 --> 00:03:25.743]  And so the trillions are going to come out of your pocket.
[00:03:25.783 --> 00:03:30.546]  That's why they're going to unify the tax rates globally by raising them.
[00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:32.247]  That's what the New World Order is.
[00:03:32.627 --> 00:03:36.050]  It's a global corporate model where private central banks
[00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:50.326]  Control the planet and set global taxes so there's nowhere to run and that's why the New York Times admits record numbers of wealthy Americans are leaving the country because this is their last chance to get out with their money.
[00:03:50.627 --> 00:03:54.930]  There's only six months left or so and then you're not getting out with five cents.
[00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:58.934]  So they run to Costa Rica.
[00:03:59.174 --> 00:04:00.435]  So they run to the Cook Islands.
[00:04:00.676 --> 00:04:02.197]  They're going to mop them up next.
[00:04:02.698 --> 00:04:03.819]  We shouldn't be running.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.484]  We should be standing and speaking up and identifying this global corporate structure.
[00:04:08.524 --> 00:04:08.965]  Anything else?
[00:04:09.245 --> 00:04:12.789]  We should be standing up like the Thais.
[00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:14.611]  We should be out there revolting like the Thais.
[00:04:16.634 --> 00:04:17.635]  That's what needs to be happening.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.542]  Well, Randy, I appreciate your call.
[00:04:19.582 --> 00:04:21.744]  Be safe over there in Germany and keep waking people up.
[00:04:22.525 --> 00:04:28.252]  But there are a lot of ways to revolt, and I'm doing that by educating people and saying, arrest the bankers, bring them to justice.
[00:04:28.292 --> 00:04:34.720]  Not your corner bank, but the Goldman Sachs crooks that are about to put a Supreme Court justice in, who's against free speech and the Second Amendment.
[00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:39.463]  That is a declaration of war against this Republic.
[00:04:39.703 --> 00:04:48.007]  When somebody touches that Bill of Rights, and this isn't touching it, this is burning it to the ground, that's an attack on every single American, regardless of what color you are.
[00:04:48.027 --> 00:04:51.148]  And that's why they want us fighting over race instead of the real issues.
[00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:52.049]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:54.482 --> 00:04:55.723]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:04:55.783 --> 00:05:01.126]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:05.989]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:06.769]  It's true.
[00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.412]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:05:11.952 --> 00:05:16.655]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:05:17.176 --> 00:05:19.097]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:05:19.477 --> 00:05:24.100]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.181]  And here's the best part.
[00:05:25.401 --> 00:05:28.183]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:05:28.483 --> 00:05:31.785]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:05:32.106 --> 00:05:34.947]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:05:35.288 --> 00:05:37.169]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[00:05:42.072 --> 00:05:43.853]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:05:45.034 --> 00:05:50.816]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:05:51.136 --> 00:05:53.578]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:54.538 --> 00:06:00.001]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.

[00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.101]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:03.084]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:03.304 --> 00:07:05.566]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:05.766 --> 00:07:11.050]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:17.735]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:18.135 --> 00:07:23.700]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.863]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:07:28.283 --> 00:07:32.266]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:32.567 --> 00:07:38.071]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:38.512 --> 00:07:41.494]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:42.074 --> 00:07:43.476]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:44.036 --> 00:07:44.536]  It's here.

[00:08:06.053 --> 00:08:07.034]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:07.595 --> 00:08:11.319]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.844]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:16.565 --> 00:08:19.166]  We're live, eight minutes into the third hour.
[00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.807]  Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[00:08:21.847 --> 00:08:28.510]  He's had television programs on BBC, Al Jazeera, RT, being picked up for its second highly rated season.
[00:08:29.531 --> 00:08:30.491]  He is with us.
[00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:31.472]  He's normally here once a month.
[00:08:31.492 --> 00:08:36.874]  This is his scheduled monthly visit, but I had him on last week because of the quickening and his predictions coming true.
[00:08:37.394 --> 00:08:45.638]  After he was on, what, last Monday, breaking down the fact that there was clear evidence that this was financial terrorism with a thousand point plunge,
[00:08:46.118 --> 00:08:46.198]  Yes.
[00:09:01.015 --> 00:09:02.276]  Yeah man, great to be back with you Alex!
[00:09:28.581 --> 00:09:31.223]  Alright my friend, you've got the floor for the balance of this segment.
[00:09:31.563 --> 00:09:44.731]  Lay out where we are, what's happening, what's going on in Europe, what's going on with Brown stepping down, Merkel in trouble, saying the banks are criminal, what's happening in the markets, a trillion's not enough, they need more, what is happening right now?
[00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:49.147]  Alrighty, well, let's talk first about Greece.
[00:09:49.247 --> 00:10:04.119]  Now, George Papandreou, the leader in Greece, he made a statement yesterday, over the weekend, that he's now going to investigate what role the Wall Street banks played in destabilizing his country, his economy.
[00:10:04.599 --> 00:10:06.401]  And this is through some back-channel
[00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:20.749]  Uh, communication between myself and folks in Greece, and I've been trying to steer them in the right direction, telling them this isn't a market problem, it's not a market failure, but it's fraud that's been perpetrated primarily by Wall Street banks.
[00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:32.556]  And my message got through, and he said yesterday that he hears words like, uh, a need for transparency, and there's fraud, and now he's going to take a stand against the bankers.
[00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:41.541]  Now, historically, when anybody has taken, anyone in politics has taken a stand against the bankers, they immediately put themselves into, you know, quite a bit of danger.
[00:10:42.062 --> 00:10:53.349]  Because the track record, if you go, you know, even if you read John Perkins' book, Confessions of an Economic Hitman, whenever somebody, a leader of a country, steps up against the bankers, they put themselves into grave danger.
[00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:58.472]  Now, this would be the first time, really, that a major western economy is taking on the Wall Street banks.
[00:10:59.052 --> 00:11:03.854]  But the people in Greece are out in the streets, and the leadership is responding.
[00:11:03.894 --> 00:11:05.594]  So he's making a statement.
[00:11:05.634 --> 00:11:15.537]  So we're going to see, because there's ample proof that the Wall Street banks purposefully crashed the Greek economy for short-term capital gains.
[00:11:16.038 --> 00:11:18.678]  So that's the first thing that's happening.
[00:11:18.738 --> 00:11:19.579]  What's happening in Iceland,
[00:11:21.002 --> 00:11:29.568]  You know, we made a film in Iceland about the collapse of the krona, the collapse of the Icelandic economy, and I've gotten pretty friendly with a lot of the legislators up in Iceland.
[00:11:30.048 --> 00:11:35.912]  I'm proposing to them that they introduce some new economic citizenship.
[00:11:36.332 --> 00:11:39.993]  So that anyone in the world who wants to escape, for example a U.S.
[00:11:40.153 --> 00:11:42.634]  citizen that wants to escape the tyranny of the U.S.
[00:11:43.054 --> 00:11:46.915]  can buy a passport for Iceland and to make it competitive.
[00:11:47.255 --> 00:11:48.915]  So it only costs $20,000.
[00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:53.256]  Right now there's only two territories or countries that offer economic citizenship.
[00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:53.796]  Nevis, St.
[00:11:53.856 --> 00:11:55.517]  Kitts, and Dominica.
[00:11:55.737 --> 00:11:56.137]  They're both
[00:11:56.897 --> 00:12:02.502]  In the Bahamas, they cost $200,000 and $75,000 respectively.
[00:12:02.522 --> 00:12:14.791]  I'm saying that Iceland, to be competitive, they can offer economic citizenship for $20,000 and they could get $200,000 or so or half a million citizens from the U.S.
[00:12:14.851 --> 00:12:16.432]  to renounce U.S.
[00:12:16.712 --> 00:12:18.053]  citizenship and move to Iceland.
[00:12:18.073 --> 00:12:24.458]  They could raise $10 billion immediately to help recapitalize their country and they are talking about
[00:12:25.058 --> 00:12:25.938]  Alright, let me stop you.
[00:12:26.018 --> 00:12:26.199]  Max.
[00:12:51.638 --> 00:12:52.939]  Okay, the global insurrection is on.
[00:12:52.979 --> 00:12:58.044]  I want to interject this and get your take on it, and I want to back you up here and have you continue.
[00:12:58.885 --> 00:13:00.146]  This is French news agency.
[00:13:00.226 --> 00:13:04.891]  Bankers jailed, sued as Iceland seeks culprits for crisis.
[00:13:05.311 --> 00:13:13.198]  Then a week ago we saw the Merkel headline where she called, you know, criminal banks causing this, though she's bought and paid for by them.
[00:13:13.238 --> 00:13:14.359]  So isn't that the danger?
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:31.682]  uh... with the greek leader and others is that they see the headlights of the train coming the global insurrection against the banking cartel they know they can't survive unless they put into a process and then maybe goldman sachs or j p morgan will flush down the toilet some mid-level trader
[00:13:32.102 --> 00:13:32.162]  Yes.
[00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:53.759]  Expatriates.
[00:13:53.779 --> 00:14:01.343]  We have the New York Times saying record numbers of wealthy people who aren't globalists leaving because they say this is the last year to get your money out.
[00:14:01.643 --> 00:14:02.823]  Just fleeing en masse.
[00:14:02.863 --> 00:14:06.125]  I'd rather flee to somewhere like Iceland, but I don't even have enough money.
[00:14:06.165 --> 00:14:09.887]  I don't think, like you said, if it was $200,000, I think I'm going to stay here and go down with the ship.
[00:14:09.927 --> 00:14:13.888]  But for people that do want to escape and be around like-minded people.
[00:14:13.928 --> 00:14:17.490]  But what about the arrests that they're reporting in Iceland?
[00:14:18.598 --> 00:14:19.058]  That's right.
[00:14:19.499 --> 00:14:31.670]  One of the bankers in London, who they say, and rightfully so, was responsible for pilfering $2 billion from the economy, is now being prosecuted.
[00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:36.074]  And, you know, it's funny because London is where a lot of these guys go.
[00:14:36.714 --> 00:14:58.423]  Uh, to get, because the, the hedge fund industry and the banking industry laws are very lenient there, and you end up with a lot of the international banking crooks end up in London, which is one of the reasons why the real estate market in London, on the high end, the very expensive, uh, residencies hasn't, uh, crashed so much, because they're supported by all these, uh, billionaires from these, uh, territories that they've absconded with all the wealth.
[00:14:58.943 --> 00:15:07.427]  So, Iceland is actively going after this guy, and it's funny because in the indictment, they use a very interesting word, Alex.
[00:15:07.447 --> 00:15:09.128]  They use the word counterfeiting.
[00:15:10.052 --> 00:15:22.604]  Now, this is fascinating because counterfeiting in the context of financial crime and financial terrorism, it points to what people know as naked short-selling.
[00:15:23.244 --> 00:15:33.033]  Naked short-selling is really one of the most common incendiary financial devices used to blow up an economy and to blow up a country, to blow up a company.
[00:15:33.073 --> 00:15:35.776]  We saw with Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, naked short-selling.
[00:15:36.036 --> 00:15:41.818]  You're selling something, you're selling a security that doesn't exist, which is the same as counterfeiting.
[00:15:42.098 --> 00:15:57.882]  So now, if they bring this whole naked short-selling scam to the surface, and they call it what it is, counterfeiting, that would point the finger at a lot of the criminality that's going on in the last five to ten years, and really bring in all the banks, because they're all guilty of this naked short-selling to a huge degree.
[00:15:58.282 --> 00:16:04.944]  Now, getting back to your question about, well, the leaders, once they take on Wall Street, are they going to be pressured to back down?
[00:16:05.925 --> 00:16:12.371]  And what we saw last Thursday, on May 6th, was the first unequivocal domestic financial terrorist attack in America.
[00:16:12.391 --> 00:16:16.356]  You know, there was a bill in Washington to break up the big banks.
[00:16:16.836 --> 00:16:19.199]  They dropped the market by a thousand points.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.601]  The lawmakers pulled away.
[00:16:21.721 --> 00:16:24.024]  They decided not to pass that law to break up the big banks.
[00:16:24.044 --> 00:16:27.828]  They also dropped the real lot at the Fed and put a fake one in, according to Ron Paul.
[00:16:28.548 --> 00:16:32.491]  Yeah, so they've got this weapon, which is they can crash a market.
[00:16:32.971 --> 00:16:43.378]  And I'm looking at today's news, and you see now that the financial terrorists are not shy about threatening to blow up people's economies and markets.
[00:16:43.418 --> 00:16:47.101]  For example, if this is in today's news, Morgan Stanley said that
[00:16:48.323 --> 00:17:02.776]  If Europe doesn't engage in full-blown quantitative easing, which means that they would buy back their own bonds, which basically would mean to destroy the euro, then Morgan Stanley threatens Europe with a 1987 crash.
[00:17:04.978 --> 00:17:11.542]  Look this up, Morgan Stanley, full-blown quantitative easing may be needed to save Europe or else we'll see a 1987-style crash.
[00:17:11.923 --> 00:17:14.184]  So they're threatening Europe with a 1987 crash.
[00:17:14.204 --> 00:17:15.585]  That's Morgan Stanley.
[00:17:15.665 --> 00:17:19.167]  A Wall Street bank is threatening the entire Eurozone.
[00:17:21.303 --> 00:17:33.392]  Here's another headline about KPMG and PricewaterhouseCooper are now considering whether or not they should get back into the business of the rating agencies.
[00:17:33.412 --> 00:17:41.418]  You know, the Moody's, S&P, and Fitch, those rating agencies that gave their blessing to all the structured products and collateralized debt obligations that turned out to be phony?
[00:17:41.918 --> 00:17:51.645]  Well, now all these consulting firms, who are also equally culpable in this nightmarish collapse of the economy, say, well, you know, those guys aren't good enough at it.
[00:17:51.665 --> 00:17:52.706]  We're going to get in the business.
[00:17:53.026 --> 00:17:57.570]  So this is, like, really just exactly the same thing.
[00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:05.755]  The fact that they can, with a straight face, say that they're going to get into the rating agency business when they themselves are some of the most crooked organizations in the U.S.
[00:18:05.795 --> 00:18:08.958]  economy, KPMG and Pricewaterhouse, is quite laughable.
[00:18:09.718 --> 00:18:18.863]  Here we have General Motors today saying that they want to get back into the financing business because of the shortage of subprime lending is holding back sales.
[00:18:19.564 --> 00:18:28.108]  Now, General Motors getting into the financing business is exactly how the economy crashed to begin with because they got out of selling cars and they got into the loan sharking business.
[00:18:28.528 --> 00:18:38.454]  Then the economy crashed, then the government gave them billions, and as a thank you to the taxpayer for getting them out of the hole, they're saying now we want to get back into the loan sharking business.
[00:18:38.934 --> 00:18:39.956]  That only took 12 months!
[00:18:40.456 --> 00:18:41.758]  Now we're not going to build cars.
[00:18:42.099 --> 00:18:52.655]  We're going to move our factories to Asia, to Brazil, and to China, and to Eastern Europe, and then all we're going to do with your bailout money here is loan it back to you, the American people.
[00:18:53.251 --> 00:18:58.535]  At uterus rates, as a loan shark, and we're trying to get you deeper into debt as we possibly can.
[00:18:59.015 --> 00:19:08.161]  And so they're trying to restart the entire cycle again until they blow up, and then they'll require more of a bailout.
[00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:20.209]  And of course, this just perpetuates this move down into what we would call the casino gulag state, where the value of the purchasing power, the wages and the savings,
[00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.132]  And the purchasing power of everybody in the U.S.
[00:19:23.192 --> 00:19:33.546]  keeps continuously, uh, degrades and drops and disintegrates and you have just an enormous cesspool, uh, where once a fine country used to, uh, reside.
[00:19:36.363 --> 00:19:37.004]  Well said.
[00:19:37.124 --> 00:19:43.430]  I've got a bunch of questions for you in the next short segment, then we're going to get into other issues you think are important to cover, and then take phone calls.
[00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:46.133]  One of my questions is, will the U.S.
[00:19:46.193 --> 00:19:47.074]  market collapse?
[00:19:47.654 --> 00:19:50.357]  When will it collapse, if it does, and how will it collapse?
[00:19:50.697 --> 00:19:52.138]  That's all coming up with Max Keiser.
[00:19:52.439 --> 00:19:54.321]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.765]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:20:00.105 --> 00:20:04.170]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:09.155]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows.
[00:20:11.834 --> 00:20:12.214]  We're good to go!
[00:20:36.281 --> 00:20:41.044]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:20:41.344 --> 00:20:45.366]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:20:45.506 --> 00:20:47.067]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:21:00.015 --> 00:21:00.955]  Tyranny is here.
[00:21:01.275 --> 00:21:04.897]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:21:05.137 --> 00:21:07.419]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:21:07.439 --> 00:21:12.882]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:21:13.302 --> 00:21:19.505]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:21:19.975 --> 00:21:25.518]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:21:25.938 --> 00:21:29.620]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:21:30.121 --> 00:21:34.123]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:21:34.403 --> 00:21:39.946]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:21:40.366 --> 00:21:43.368]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:21:43.908 --> 00:21:45.289]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:21:45.874 --> 00:21:46.335]  It's here.

[00:21:54.961 --> 00:22:04.688]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:22:04.988 --> 00:22:11.032]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:22:11.432 --> 00:22:20.278]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:22:20.638 --> 00:22:29.564]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:22:29.825 --> 00:22:34.428]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:22:34.448 --> 00:22:35.989]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:36.229 --> 00:22:38.731]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[00:22:47.277 --> 00:22:47.618]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:55.842 --> 00:22:56.502]  The problem.
[00:22:56.582 --> 00:22:58.624]  How do I cook food without power?
[00:22:59.144 --> 00:23:01.305]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[00:23:01.865 --> 00:23:04.067]  How do I get emergency radio broadcast?
[00:23:04.547 --> 00:23:06.168]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[00:23:07.028 --> 00:23:15.833]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KaroStove.
[00:23:16.033 --> 00:23:16.934]  KaroStove has been

[00:23:50.685 --> 00:23:53.767]  KeroStove, for family emergency solutions.
[00:24:01.451 --> 00:24:03.853]  Max Keiser is our guest, MaxKeiser.com.
[00:24:04.433 --> 00:24:05.695]  Your call is coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:06.795 --> 00:24:16.844]  Max, I talked to one of my neighbors, I talked to other people that are somewhat successful in business in Austin, and they say, well, I'm not in the stock market, so I don't care what these big banks are doing.
[00:24:18.584 --> 00:24:34.173]  And I don't understand this yuppie pre-programmed arrogance where you try to warn people that you know and they act like it's weak to even care or even be involved in society as long as they think they're doing okay.
[00:24:34.993 --> 00:24:37.014]  I mean, everyone is connected to the stock market.
[00:24:37.094 --> 00:24:38.534]  Everyone is connected to the currencies.
[00:24:38.654 --> 00:24:44.436]  Everyone is connected through taxes with these trillions of dollars of, quote, bailouts used for bonuses.
[00:24:45.056 --> 00:24:55.140]  I mean, what do you call that mindset where people don't understand the incredible magnitude of what's happening in global markets right now and where this is leading us?
[00:24:56.816 --> 00:24:59.799]  Well, you can explain it in the following way.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:13.434]  The average experience of the average American is masked to a large degree by the fact that most people in America are unaware of the benefits accrued to them.
[00:25:14.134 --> 00:25:17.656]  Because the world reserve currency is the US dollar.
[00:25:17.917 --> 00:25:25.081]  So there is no radical currency risk that you see in other countries, and the currency collapses that you see in other countries.
[00:25:25.562 --> 00:25:32.126]  And it also means that things like gasoline are incredibly cheap in America relative to other countries.
[00:25:32.366 --> 00:25:39.751]  Now what is going to happen, what people on your show are talking about, and what I've been talking about, and what I see over here in Europe,
[00:25:40.391 --> 00:25:40.952]  I think so.
[00:25:58.622 --> 00:26:05.606]  Bank shenanigans, including paying state, local, federal, and world tax.
[00:26:05.666 --> 00:26:11.790]  Because, of course, the world currency, you need a global central bank who's going to charge a global tax.
[00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:16.152]  And then Americans will wake up and they'll say, oh my God, you know, it all happened.
[00:26:16.212 --> 00:26:25.218]  It's happening right now because the special drawing rights that are being used right now as part of this huge reconfiguration of the European banking system and the trillion dollar
[00:26:25.738 --> 00:26:26.980]  We're good to go.
[00:26:44.322 --> 00:26:51.186]  Be comparable to other major currencies in terms of the amount traded, and the scope, and the influence.
[00:26:51.506 --> 00:26:56.869]  And then you'll start to see things quoted in special drawing rights, and they'll normalize the special drawing rights.
[00:26:57.249 --> 00:27:03.992]  And then it'll be announced that as part of Brennan Woods 2, they're going to reconfigure the global currency grid.
[00:27:04.333 --> 00:27:04.773]  The U.S.
[00:27:04.813 --> 00:27:08.515]  dollar will be devalued by 50%, like it was in the 30s.
[00:27:08.815 --> 00:27:11.697]  Gold will be upwardly valued to $5,000 or $10,000 an ounce.
[00:27:13.018 --> 00:27:13.919]  And they just expect...
[00:27:27.998 --> 00:27:28.398]  I think so.
[00:27:46.716 --> 00:27:53.522]  Now, as soon as that situation ends, as it is happening right now, you'll have this incredible, you know, shock.
[00:27:54.462 --> 00:27:58.286]  And then it'll be way, way, way too late to do anything about it.
[00:27:58.346 --> 00:28:01.048]  So, I can understand why people are in a coma.
[00:28:01.923 --> 00:28:05.587]  When it comes to understanding the position of the U.S.
[00:28:05.627 --> 00:28:18.019]  relative to the rest of the world, and I can also anticipate that when this thing finally makes the break, there's going to be an incredible gasp of horror that'll just go from coast to coast.
[00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:19.821]  There will be absolute shock.
[00:28:20.041 --> 00:28:21.563]  How did this happen?
[00:28:26.176 --> 00:28:52.882]  And the banks will say, the big mega banks will say, don't worry, we're going to save you again with SDRs, we're transcending national currencies and we'll just make up to the power of infinity whatever amount of fiat money we want and you're going to pay us taxes on the right to use this new global cashless society system and they'll just bypass the three global regional currencies that the Trilateral Commission talked about in the 1970s, correct?
[00:28:55.718 --> 00:28:57.979]  That is basically correct.
[00:28:58.039 --> 00:29:07.744]  In other words, with the introduction of the Special Drawing Right, they will have another way to add another layer to this global Ponzi scheme, where all of the U.S.
[00:29:07.804 --> 00:29:12.146]  dollar-denominated debts will be re-securitized.
[00:29:12.666 --> 00:29:15.007]  Most of the debt will be off the balance sheet.
[00:29:15.428 --> 00:29:21.951]  Some of it will be included in the new SDR, but the SDR will be loaded up with more debt than even the U.S.
[00:29:21.991 --> 00:29:23.892]  dollar, and the result will be
[00:29:24.532 --> 00:29:43.003]  This constant downward pressure from above where no wages ever go up, no savers ever get a return greater than .0001% on their savings, and you end up in this casino gulag state where the only way anyone can make any more money than subsistence... Stay there!
[00:29:43.183 --> 00:29:43.603]  Got a break.
[00:29:43.783 --> 00:29:44.183]  Stay there.
[00:29:45.104 --> 00:29:46.025]  We're on the march.
[00:29:46.505 --> 00:29:48.106]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:49.026 --> 00:29:51.708]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:54.358 --> 00:30:02.101]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[00:30:02.361 --> 00:30:09.424]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[00:30:09.705 --> 00:30:16.507]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[00:30:16.688 --> 00:30:17.528]  Listen carefully.
[00:30:17.908 --> 00:30:27.415]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[00:30:27.635 --> 00:30:31.658]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[00:30:31.859 --> 00:30:34.721]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.

[00:31:53.672 --> 00:31:55.974]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:31:56.074 --> 00:31:58.297]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:31:58.377 --> 00:32:01.560]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.324]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:32:06.705 --> 00:32:10.889]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:32:11.189 --> 00:32:13.532]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:32:13.672 --> 00:32:16.076]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:32:16.096 --> 00:32:18.999]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:26.950]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:32:27.273 --> 00:32:32.534]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:32:32.674 --> 00:32:35.455]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:32:35.515 --> 00:32:38.956]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:32:39.196 --> 00:32:40.136]  And I got news for you.
[00:32:40.276 --> 00:32:41.576]  You're everyone else.

[00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:06.635]  We're going back to Max Keiser with a few other questions I've got and then I promise you in probably five, six minutes we're going to start going to your calls.
[00:33:06.695 --> 00:33:09.858]  Tom, Rachel, Steven, Ian, Steve and others.
[00:33:10.398 --> 00:33:13.460]  Again, we're live on this Monday, 17th day of May 2010 edition.
[00:33:15.233 --> 00:33:20.094]  Before we go any further, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio broadcast possible.
[00:33:21.034 --> 00:33:22.615]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:33:22.655 --> 00:33:26.855]  He has a free handgun and five days of world-class firearms training waiting for you.
[00:33:26.875 --> 00:33:28.616]  It's not enough to just own guns.
[00:33:28.636 --> 00:33:30.356]  You've got to know how to use them, and this is the place to go.
[00:33:30.636 --> 00:33:37.558]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute, secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[00:33:37.898 --> 00:33:43.459]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:33:44.099 --> 00:33:45.881]  I believe now is the time to get trained and ready.
[00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:49.066]  There's no drill instructor or boot camp tough guy mentality.
[00:33:49.586 --> 00:33:50.708]  It's got all the training you need.
[00:33:50.748 --> 00:33:52.350]  Two day, four day, five day courses.
[00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.032]  Go to Front Sight, like the front of your rifle.
[00:33:54.573 --> 00:33:56.155]  FrontSight.com.
[00:33:56.215 --> 00:33:57.817]  FrontSight.com.
[00:33:59.019 --> 00:34:04.166]  Also, a lot of you are thinking about getting into solar power in your home or your workshop or for camping.
[00:34:04.346 --> 00:34:09.213]  This is a great unit we've been putting out through our sponsors, Solutions from Science, for three years.
[00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:11.035]  I've got nothing but rave reviews.
[00:34:11.096 --> 00:34:13.799]  It's a solar panel system, a control panel, the battery system.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.581]  It'll run quite a bit in your house.
[00:34:15.601 --> 00:34:17.162]  You get a bunch of these to run your whole house.
[00:34:17.542 --> 00:34:21.005]  It's a great way to stick more than just your toe, but your foot in.
[00:34:21.025 --> 00:34:24.687]  And it's very affordable, very inexpensive compared to a lot of the systems we've seen.
[00:34:25.087 --> 00:34:27.849]  So you can simply go to MySolarBackup.com.
[00:34:28.229 --> 00:34:28.890]  That's one word.

[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.182]  And then finally, here...
[00:34:50.532 --> 00:34:56.796]  Invisible Empire, a New World Order defined film by Jason Burmess we put out last month.
[00:34:56.896 --> 00:34:58.957]  Very, very important material to wake people up.
[00:34:59.037 --> 00:35:01.719]  Folks are waking up, but they don't have all the info.
[00:35:01.919 --> 00:35:02.979]  These films will give it to them.
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:17.548]  And of course, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic that I'm in, that Gary Franchi coming up next hour, maybe William Lewis, gets into Tenth Amendment, states' rights, grand juries, Second Amendment, how to get your sheriff selected to take your counties back, now shipping out.
[00:35:17.728 --> 00:35:18.909]  Don't Tread on Me available
[00:35:19.309 --> 00:35:22.350]  at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:28.513]  Okay, going back to Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com quickly.
[00:35:29.273 --> 00:35:34.355]  You basically answered my next question in the last segment, but in layman's simple terms.
[00:35:35.015 --> 00:35:35.695]  Yeah.
[00:35:35.715 --> 00:35:38.717]  Do you see Asia plunging next, or how far will Europe plunge?
[00:35:38.757 --> 00:35:40.438]  Do you think the Eurozone's going to break up?
[00:35:40.478 --> 00:35:50.784]  The Germans are saying that major German newspapers are calling for a Deutsch Reich zone that only has the richest countries in Europe that are part of it.
[00:35:51.204 --> 00:35:52.685]  So what do you see happening with the Euro?
[00:35:53.085 --> 00:35:57.147]  I mean, I know you can't guess this exactly, but you've been very accurate in the past.
[00:35:57.427 --> 00:35:58.868]  How do you see this unfolding?
[00:35:58.908 --> 00:36:00.469]  Who do you see going down next?
[00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:03.591]  When does this really start to hit the U.S.? ?
[00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.731]  Right.
[00:36:05.911 --> 00:36:12.003]  Well, as you say, I've been pretty good at framing this and predicting this.
[00:36:13.818 --> 00:36:19.781]  The, what you have to understand is he's got a multi-trillion dollar hedge fund business.
[00:36:19.862 --> 00:36:31.268]  You know, a hedge fund is just a fund that is not bound by any restrictions in terms of the types of bets that they can make and the leverage that they have at their availability.
[00:36:31.828 --> 00:36:38.492]  And what they do is they go from currency to currency and they ferret out which ones are the weakest.
[00:36:39.293 --> 00:36:50.783]  Uh, they then scare the bejesus out of the folks, they float rumors about the economic collapse, they crash the economy, they make a quick hundred billion dollars or so, and then they move on.
[00:36:51.404 --> 00:36:53.406]  And, um, from the Eurozone,
[00:36:54.442 --> 00:36:58.703]  I think that they've beat up the Euro pretty good here in the last few weeks.
[00:36:59.243 --> 00:37:01.544]  I think the next stop is the British Pound.
[00:37:02.084 --> 00:37:04.124]  The British Pound, they've got a new government in Britain.
[00:37:04.805 --> 00:37:07.045]  They're trying to bring in some reforms.
[00:37:07.445 --> 00:37:09.506]  They're talking about bringing in banking reform.
[00:37:10.066 --> 00:37:17.408]  So I think that next time we talk, we'll be talking about the tragic fall of the British Pound.
[00:37:17.928 --> 00:37:19.208]  They'll beat that up for a while.
[00:37:20.473 --> 00:37:28.075]  And then they either will go back to Eurozone and attack the Euro, or they may, you know, come back to the U.S.
[00:37:28.115 --> 00:37:29.116]  because the U.S.
[00:37:29.136 --> 00:37:32.416]  is always the currency that these guys know best.
[00:37:32.456 --> 00:37:39.098]  They know how to crash it in the most efficient manner, and it's always in their pocket.
[00:37:39.118 --> 00:37:40.519]  They could always crash the dollar.
[00:37:40.759 --> 00:37:44.780]  That's something they could always do for a quick buck, but you can't do it 100% of the time.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.321]  You've got to take turns crashing different currencies at different times.
[00:37:48.761 --> 00:37:54.028]  So I think, the way I see it, the next is the British Pound.
[00:37:54.048 --> 00:37:58.874]  The Japanese Yen is kind of a possibility at some point.
[00:37:59.254 --> 00:38:05.562]  Their economy has gone now 20 straight years of deflation, and it's still highly problematic.
[00:38:06.062 --> 00:38:14.186]  They import something like, you know, 100% of their energy, so it's really at the mercies of the global economic system.
[00:38:14.727 --> 00:38:17.828]  So that's always a nice one to go in there occasionally.
[00:38:18.188 --> 00:38:21.690]  But they use really the yen, really, as what's called a funding currency.
[00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:22.731]  In other words, they borrow.
[00:38:23.591 --> 00:38:23.992]  I think so.
[00:38:38.142 --> 00:38:55.115]  Right before that economy collapsed, I sat in the 101 Hotel in the sushi bar, and I talked to some bankers from Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, and they said, look, in about six months, we're going to attack Iceland, and we're going to crash the Icelandic krona.
[00:38:55.755 --> 00:38:59.896]  And they weren't shy about talking about it, and this is exactly what they did.
[00:39:00.576 --> 00:39:08.878]  Now, a few years later, they're finally getting around to putting some people in jail for counterfeiting and securities fraud and all kinds of other crimes.
[00:39:09.498 --> 00:39:15.860]  And hopefully they'll put somebody in jail to sit next to Bernie Madoff, and hopefully Lloyd Blankfein will be there shortly.
[00:39:17.924 --> 00:39:26.186]  And if we just continue to point out the Emperor's butt naked and isn't wearing any golden outfit, like the little three-year-old in the Emperor's New Clothes parable.
[00:39:26.207 --> 00:39:28.967]  In fact, guys, print me the Emperor's New Clothes parable.
[00:39:28.987 --> 00:39:30.348]  I want to read that next hour on air.
[00:39:30.708 --> 00:39:33.129]  If we just point out the obvious, it's going to implode.
[00:39:33.449 --> 00:39:40.511]  Max, did you see Fox News, the New York Times, AFP, Reuters in the last month all come out with a psy-op and say,
[00:39:41.431 --> 00:39:46.477]  Yes, the troops are helping grow the opium, because if we don't grow it, Al-Qaeda will get the money.
[00:39:46.818 --> 00:39:57.350]  I mean, this had been coming out that our government was there for the opium, $500 billion a year, and shipping it in, and the Russians had said this, but now they're so arrogant they hide it in plain view.
[00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:57.791]  It's like
[00:39:58.956 --> 00:40:10.366]  It'd be like President Obama being naked at the podium and saying he wasn't naked, and we're not supposed to point out he's naked, so it's some kind of mind control thing where they just come out and say, yeah, we grow the opium.
[00:40:10.746 --> 00:40:13.068]  Have you ever talked to Catherine Austin Fitz about this?
[00:40:13.649 --> 00:40:14.530]  Yeah, the big red button.
[00:40:15.719 --> 00:40:26.988]  She's got an excellent, a lot of work on the CIA, Afghani opium crops, and also, you know, a lot of these hedge funds that you read about, this came out during the savings and loan collapse.
[00:40:27.528 --> 00:40:33.433]  They discovered that many of the hedge funds were actually backed by the government and CIA and other organizations.
[00:40:35.294 --> 00:40:46.118]  Back in the 2008 crash, when Hank Paulson put the gun to Congress's head and said, give us $700 billion or we're going to crash the economy, a lot of people in Congress were actually short bank stocks.
[00:40:46.158 --> 00:40:50.799]  They used an exchange-traded fund, which was making negative bets against bank stocks.
[00:40:50.819 --> 00:40:55.001]  So those congressmen were actually making money as those bank stocks were collapsing.
[00:40:55.701 --> 00:41:00.222]  So these guys are just fully invested in the collapse, and that's why I call them suicide bankers.
[00:41:00.623 --> 00:41:11.066]  Because they have a fundamentalist belief in capitalism as their religion, and they're willing to blow themselves up in the name of their religious belief and fanatical capitalism.
[00:41:12.166 --> 00:41:20.709]  Today, before I forget, Meredith Whitney, who's a very popular analyst now, she's the one who called out Citibank a few years ago, right before the crash.
[00:41:21.309 --> 00:41:24.530]  She said this, quote, financial reform
[00:41:25.501 --> 00:41:31.927]  Will cause, quote, tragic unemployment levels for an extended period of time.
[00:41:31.947 --> 00:41:34.189]  You see what she's saying?
[00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:41.195]  If you try to reform us, then unemployment levels will be tragic for an extended period of time.
[00:41:41.315 --> 00:41:42.396]  That's an outright threat!
[00:41:42.876 --> 00:41:45.278]  That's just an outright threat coming from Wall Street.
[00:41:45.498 --> 00:41:48.621]  If you try to reform us, you're never gonna get a job again.
[00:41:48.641 --> 00:41:53.065]  You know, that's just outright tyranny, I mean, what else can you call it?
[00:41:53.919 --> 00:41:55.059]  You're absolutely right.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.001]  Well said, Max Keiser, and they just continue to threaten.
[00:41:58.341 --> 00:41:59.801]  Let's talk to Tom in Connecticut.
[00:41:59.821 --> 00:42:00.502]  You're on the air.
[00:42:02.563 --> 00:42:04.563]  Hi, yeah, this is perfect what you're talking about.
[00:42:04.583 --> 00:42:20.010]  I did want to comment on something you said yesterday, Alex, and that was you said it was good that they were arresting the bankers in Iceland, but then you said it's okay, you know, we have the great local bankers down the street where you can get a loan for a car.
[00:42:20.677 --> 00:42:25.902]  But a private banker is a private banker is a private banker no matter how small they are, how big they are.
[00:42:26.262 --> 00:42:30.826]  They have the power through factional reserve lending to create money out of nothing.
[00:42:31.527 --> 00:42:34.990]  And what we need is public credit.
[00:42:35.461 --> 00:42:37.062]  Directly through our government.
[00:42:37.102 --> 00:42:38.762]  We need to take the responsibility.
[00:42:39.423 --> 00:42:40.283]  Well, let me say this.
[00:42:40.483 --> 00:42:41.904]  I mean, I'm all for state banks.
[00:42:42.564 --> 00:42:43.625]  But that's still a bank.
[00:42:44.185 --> 00:42:47.126]  And it's not going to be able to compete if it doesn't have the fractional system.
[00:42:47.706 --> 00:42:49.367]  And this is a very complex issue.
[00:42:49.867 --> 00:42:52.328]  But local banks, some are good, some are bad.
[00:42:52.368 --> 00:42:59.371]  The point is, we don't want the mega six banks in the U.S., several others globally, but there's no more than ten, any way you slice it.
[00:42:59.871 --> 00:43:02.893]  So just for simplicity, we don't want the mega ten banks.
[00:43:03.573 --> 00:43:08.314]  To have the regulatory power to scoop up the smaller banks, because then we're really in trouble.
[00:43:08.614 --> 00:43:09.254]  Max Keiser.
[00:43:10.594 --> 00:43:19.256]  In North Dakota, they have a banking system which is sound, because they pass some laws to get rid of a lot of the abuses.
[00:43:19.916 --> 00:43:24.177]  And Ellen Brown, who's a very fine journalist, has done a lot of work.
[00:43:24.237 --> 00:43:28.298]  If you type in Ellen Brown in the search engine, and search North Dakota banks,
[00:43:28.938 --> 00:43:47.507]  It is possible to run banks in an equitable, fair way, and North Dakota, surprisingly, people probably don't know about this, they actually have some pretty decent banks because they have decided to not try to run with the wolves and to simply get in the very simple business of
[00:43:47.952 --> 00:43:49.794]  But it's the same thing with Texas banks.
[00:43:50.034 --> 00:43:51.636]  They're some of the wealthiest in the country.
[00:43:52.196 --> 00:43:56.540]  And the Texas Banking Association has come out and said, we're not selling derivatives.
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:57.902]  We're not the big mega banks.
[00:43:58.102 --> 00:43:59.023]  They are dangerous.
[00:43:59.423 --> 00:44:06.270]  And so that's important to be friendly with regional banks to be able to defeat the big banks.
[00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:11.575]  And then later, if we want to change something at that level and fix abuses at the local level, I think it's great.
[00:44:11.615 --> 00:44:12.516]  But Tom, finish your point.
[00:44:13.459 --> 00:44:19.402]  Yeah, well, that is excellent that Max brought up Ellen Brown in her book, The Web of Debt, in the Bank of North Dakota.
[00:44:19.742 --> 00:44:22.983]  No, the Bank of North Dakota is a state-owned and operated bank.
[00:44:23.143 --> 00:44:25.064]  It is true sovereign money.
[00:44:25.404 --> 00:44:32.488]  We need a sovereign monetary system, not a private debt money system, what we have now, where they have the power to create money.
[00:44:32.748 --> 00:44:33.848]  They are like a mafia.
[00:44:34.168 --> 00:44:39.911]  We have to realize that the private bankers of the world are like a global mafia, and we have to stand up to them.
[00:44:40.251 --> 00:44:43.513]  Like, the people of a village stand up to the mafia and run them out of town.
[00:44:43.773 --> 00:44:44.174]  I agree.
[00:44:44.334 --> 00:44:45.494]  Tom, well said.
[00:44:45.675 --> 00:44:46.335]  Absolutely.
[00:44:46.695 --> 00:44:50.758]  Currency should be a symbol of exchange, not the actual energy.
[00:44:51.738 --> 00:44:52.839]  It doesn't have the value.
[00:44:52.919 --> 00:44:55.381]  It's an agreed upon mode of exchange.
[00:44:56.021 --> 00:44:58.303]  And we need to get back to what we had pre-1913.
[00:44:58.723 --> 00:45:00.984]  Let's talk to Rachel in New York.
[00:45:01.024 --> 00:45:01.645]  You're on the air.
[00:45:01.665 --> 00:45:03.106]  Hi.
[00:45:04.547 --> 00:45:07.849]  I just wanted to let you know that one of the things that has been going on lately
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:14.671]  Um, that is not being reported is that many people up here in New York on Wall Street are withdrawing their 401k's.
[00:45:17.063 --> 00:45:19.465]  Actually, I have seen that in the news.
[00:45:20.045 --> 00:45:30.611]  The word is getting out, but it's not a big national story because of Bloomberg and other reports that the federal government is ordering private pension funds to, quote, invest in failed banks.
[00:45:31.152 --> 00:45:36.495]  I mean, since when can the government order because they have regulatory threats if they don't?
[00:45:36.535 --> 00:45:38.116]  See, they can selectively enforce.
[00:45:38.496 --> 00:45:39.677]  Max Keiser, break that down.
[00:45:40.783 --> 00:45:41.003]  Right.
[00:45:41.043 --> 00:45:43.725]  Well, 401k accounts are the retirement accounts.
[00:45:43.745 --> 00:45:45.927]  People squirrel away money every month with their employer.
[00:45:46.147 --> 00:45:59.658]  Now, if they're liquidating those accounts, what's not being clear here is either it's because of duress and they need that money because they're going bankrupt and they have to draw down their savings, or two, they fear tax hikes coming.
[00:45:59.998 --> 00:46:09.007]  And the tax advantages of the 401k evaporate, so why not take that money out and put it somewhere in another institution that you don't have the same kind of risks?
[00:46:09.407 --> 00:46:19.097]  Now, I think what the caller is referring to is that people are removing money from their 401ks as an offensive measure, not a defensive measure, as a way to
[00:46:19.817 --> 00:46:21.357]  Well said, Max Keiser.
[00:46:21.457 --> 00:46:22.378]  Anything else, Rachel?
[00:46:22.398 --> 00:46:23.138]  No, that's all.
[00:46:23.158 --> 00:46:30.800]  I just wanted to say many of the people we're speaking to say they'd rather have their money now than wait until they're 58 years old when it won't be there anymore.
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.000]  They'll take the tax hit now.
[00:46:48.442 --> 00:46:49.723]  Yeah, no, that's accelerating.
[00:46:49.783 --> 00:46:50.243]  Good point.
[00:46:50.663 --> 00:46:53.865]  Let's talk to Stephen in California.
[00:46:53.885 --> 00:46:54.446]  You're on the air.
[00:46:54.466 --> 00:46:56.187]  Mr. Jones?
[00:46:56.447 --> 00:46:56.847]  Yes, sir.
[00:46:58.168 --> 00:46:58.989]  Pleasure to be on your show.
[00:46:59.049 --> 00:47:01.550]  I'm a first-time caller and kind of a first-time listener.
[00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:10.676]  And as a young person living in today, I've become educated on your show and you instill the passion slash interest in government.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:18.491]  And I was wondering, you know, how a person in my position, my family has no legacy and all that, how do I get into that sort of thing?
[00:47:19.032 --> 00:47:25.182]  Well, look, in high school, in college, they make it boring, it's government, it's like, it's like...
[00:47:26.306 --> 00:47:30.470]  Alcatraz or something, or it's like some, you know, island of Dr. Maru.
[00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:32.793]  It's some imaginary thing far off.
[00:47:33.173 --> 00:47:43.904]  You've got to be involved in government, because if you don't, it's going to get taken over by shysters, and they're going to rob the hell out of you, and hire a bunch of uniformed thugs to enforce their corruption.
[00:47:43.944 --> 00:47:44.744]  It's called tyranny.
[00:47:45.345 --> 00:47:54.890]  And so we've became the wealthiest country in the world because we had a small government and we were on top of things and we allowed people to keep most their wealth because it was their God-given right.
[00:47:55.290 --> 00:48:08.217]  Now we're becoming the center of evil because our wealth has been used to dominate the globe and build an empire and no one is as enslaved as people inside the empire and so people are waking up and deciding I better get involved in government.
[00:48:08.497 --> 00:48:10.799]  Then they go get involved in government and they find
[00:48:11.539 --> 00:48:16.782]  That for those that did get involved, there's a fake left-right choice, which is meant to further confuse them.
[00:48:17.243 --> 00:48:17.623]  Okay?
[00:48:18.584 --> 00:48:32.272]  They've followed the yellow brick road, they've gotten to the Emerald Palace, they've gone in, and there's this big flaming head telling them, I am the Great Oz, and the next level is going, no, Republicans and Democrats, you're not.
[00:48:33.533 --> 00:48:39.538]  Well, if you go back, this is a very interesting question because it's a very interesting inflection point, and especially for a young person.
[00:48:39.558 --> 00:48:40.278]  Now, if you remember,
[00:49:01.107 --> 00:49:11.673]  Ronald Reagan said, government is the problem, and he said this under the influence of thinkers like Milton Friedman, who believed that the market could solve all problems.
[00:49:12.033 --> 00:49:21.398]  Now in 2010, people are saying, you know what, the market is actually the problem, and it's creating an incredible amount of problems, on top of problems.
[00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:22.678]  So if that's true, then
[00:49:24.259 --> 00:49:32.982]  Does that mean we're going to ask ourselves or look at the possibility that there might be some saving grace in the idea of having a government?
[00:49:33.022 --> 00:49:34.342]  But here's the next problem, Max.
[00:49:34.402 --> 00:49:34.862]  Let me comment.
[00:49:34.882 --> 00:49:37.563]  The fathers of the United States created a government.
[00:49:37.623 --> 00:49:39.504]  That's what they got this country started on.
[00:49:39.544 --> 00:49:40.784]  They didn't start with a hedge fund.
[00:49:41.124 --> 00:49:42.385]  They started with a constitution.
[00:49:42.847 --> 00:49:52.037]  No, I agree with you, but again, to expand on that, under the Constitution, Congress controls the issuance of currency and credit, not private bankers.
[00:49:52.057 --> 00:49:53.859]  So the confusion is going to be with the public.
[00:49:54.339 --> 00:50:01.547]  You're going to have the private bankers pose as a solution with a type of regulation that is only going to empower them even more.
[00:50:01.927 --> 00:50:03.269]  So, how do you get past that?
[00:50:03.709 --> 00:50:13.394]  Well, that's... First, so my question is, there's a lot of rhetoric, and especially in the libertarian camp, that government has nothing to offer.
[00:50:14.134 --> 00:50:17.596]  And, you know, I think that that is a self-defeating position.
[00:50:17.916 --> 00:50:21.278]  There has to be some role of government, first of all.
[00:50:21.398 --> 00:50:24.499]  So, government, therefore, does not become a dirty word.
[00:50:24.639 --> 00:50:26.200]  There is a role for government.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.280]  That's step number one.
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.281]  Step number two is,
[00:50:28.821 --> 00:50:31.342]  As you say, yeah, well, it's all in the Constitution.
[00:50:31.563 --> 00:50:37.046]  They recognize gold and silver as the only constitutionally recognized form of money and currency.
[00:50:37.306 --> 00:50:45.610]  If that's true, then all of the fiat currency, fractional reserve, derivative market scamming that's going on has to be taken completely out of the system.
[00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:47.771]  Yeah, we've got to go back to the Constitution.
[00:50:48.071 --> 00:50:48.672]  That's right.
[00:50:48.732 --> 00:50:49.152]  Stay there.
[00:50:49.292 --> 00:50:49.592]  Stay there.
[00:50:49.612 --> 00:50:52.054]  We're going to talk to Ian, Steve, Kevin, and others.
[00:50:52.834 --> 00:50:54.355]  And, Stephen, I'm going to try to answer your question.
[00:50:54.895 --> 00:50:57.797]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've gotta try MyPillow!

[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.061]  Tyranny is here.
[00:52:00.381 --> 00:52:03.945]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:03.965 --> 00:52:06.527]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:06.547 --> 00:52:11.993]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:52:12.413 --> 00:52:18.640]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:24.621]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:28.722]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:52:29.222 --> 00:52:33.203]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[00:52:39.464 --> 00:52:42.345]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:43.005 --> 00:52:44.406]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:44.986 --> 00:52:45.466]  It's here.

[00:52:58.131 --> 00:53:05.134]  Let's talk about down-home value made in the USA blue jeans like you wore as a kid.
[00:53:05.455 --> 00:53:05.895]  Remember?
[00:53:06.335 --> 00:53:07.816]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:53:10.356 --> 00:53:13.081]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:53:14.984 --> 00:53:18.349]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:21.414]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:53:23.403 --> 00:53:34.010]  We're good old-fashioned comfort.
[00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:35.611]  Get Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:53:35.891 --> 00:53:37.192]  Every stitch guaranteed.
[00:53:37.412 --> 00:53:40.414]  In our Defender motorcycle jean comes Kevlar reinforced.
[00:53:40.655 --> 00:53:41.475]  See them at gusset.com.
[00:53:41.495 --> 00:53:42.516]  That's gusset.com.
[00:53:42.636 --> 00:53:43.196]  Or call 888-848-7738.
[00:53:43.216 --> 00:53:43.437]  That's 888-848-7738.
[00:53:43.457 --> 00:53:43.937]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:53:43.977 --> 00:53:44.337]  Got it.
[00:53:44.397 --> 00:53:44.757]  Others don't.
[00:53:57.566 --> 00:54:00.427]  What if I say I'm not one of your slaves?
[00:54:03.069 --> 00:54:05.390]  What if I say I will never surrender?
[00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:14.035]  We're going to continue with the calls in this segment and the next and then Gary Franchi of Restore the Republic with Don't Tread on Me is coming on.
[00:54:14.055 --> 00:54:15.396]  I want to play Miss Arizona.
[00:54:16.988 --> 00:54:20.719]  Miss Oklahoma talking about Arizona, says she supports Arizona law.
[00:54:20.739 --> 00:54:23.406]  We're going to talk about states' rights coming up.
[00:54:24.537 --> 00:54:30.439]  But before I go any further with Max Keiser, I want to simplify this, because this gets confusing for people, because it is so simple.
[00:54:30.479 --> 00:54:32.000]  Sometimes the simplest things are confusing.
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:43.745]  I'm against anything big and monolithic, whether it's government or hedge funds that are bigger than any government, money-wise, because they just created themselves, as Thomas Jefferson warned they would, a blank check to take over the planet.
[00:54:44.065 --> 00:54:53.109]  You know, to paraphrase Jefferson, he said, you know, you could take out private central bankers, but if you ever let them back in within one day, they'll buy up the whole world with fake credit they produce.
[00:54:53.149 --> 00:54:53.309]  So,
[00:54:54.309 --> 00:55:05.952]  The problem is with a quote free market is it's not free market when the CIA with a inner coterie of private banks gives themselves unlimited trillions and uses their own regulatory power to shut down their competition.
[00:55:06.433 --> 00:55:13.695]  And so we need government to protect the true free market and to have rules against counterfeiting as Max Keiser said.
[00:55:14.195 --> 00:55:15.235]  Counterfeiting is illegal.
[00:55:15.555 --> 00:55:21.497]  If I opened up a fake company, started selling stock, claiming it was in gold mines I didn't own, it would be a fraud.
[00:55:21.937 --> 00:55:31.160]  Well, it's a step past that, with the fractional reserve banking, with the derivatives, with these fake insurance companies certifying it, and then taxpayers having to bail it out.
[00:55:31.521 --> 00:55:33.141]  So, that is the issue.
[00:55:33.401 --> 00:55:39.384]  The, quote, free market's being demonized by the bankers themselves, because they want a global controlled market that they control.
[00:55:39.784 --> 00:55:42.605]  And so, it's... until the public becomes educated on this...
[00:55:43.445 --> 00:55:44.266]  It's just going to get worse.
[00:55:44.666 --> 00:55:46.829]  Again, MaxKaiser.com is his website.
[00:55:46.909 --> 00:55:47.750]  Very informative stuff.
[00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:55.618]  You can watch him on RT, as well as Press TV does weekly television shows that are some of the most popular on those channels.
[00:55:56.479 --> 00:55:59.262]  But let's go back to your phone calls.
[00:56:00.323 --> 00:56:01.564]  Briefly answering Steve's question.
[00:56:01.985 --> 00:56:03.987]  Steven, I don't know how you get involved, quote, in government.
[00:56:04.187 --> 00:56:10.529]  Start fighting tyranny, form your own group, go to city council, speak out, start a blog, and you'll learn and get better as you go.
[00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:13.591]  Ian in England, you're on the air with questions for Max Keiser.
[00:56:16.492 --> 00:56:17.412]  Hi there.
[00:56:17.672 --> 00:56:21.374]  Hello all beyond, this is Airstrip 2 calling, over, go ahead.
[00:56:21.394 --> 00:56:23.815]  How are you doing Alex?
[00:56:24.135 --> 00:56:24.395]  Good.
[00:56:25.895 --> 00:56:26.356]  Good to be on.
[00:56:27.116 --> 00:56:28.616]  Yeah, it's good to hear Max Keiser.
[00:56:28.957 --> 00:56:29.497]  I've always been
[00:56:30.963 --> 00:56:34.204]  An interested listener to his opinions, and of course, your own.
[00:56:35.304 --> 00:56:46.787]  With regards to the British parliamentary catastrophe that's been going on, I mean, people think that they can't make a difference, but we've demonstrated that we've effectively created a constitutional crisis here.
[00:56:48.647 --> 00:56:52.748]  There was nobody who was willing to back up the parliamentary process.
[00:56:53.929 --> 00:56:59.530]  And I think that that's certainly a statement which people can take a little bit of pleasure from, if not
[00:57:00.399 --> 00:57:02.021]  a great deal of influence from.
[00:57:02.041 --> 00:57:10.369]  So, it demonstrates the fact that these people don't have any kind of mandate to operate the way they have been doing.
[00:57:10.389 --> 00:57:12.291]  That's right, all three of the big parties are hated.
[00:57:12.571 --> 00:57:14.313]  Your take on what's happening in England, Max?
[00:57:15.302 --> 00:57:16.043]  Yeah, they did.
[00:57:16.083 --> 00:57:20.786]  They triggered a crisis, a constitutional crisis, as your caller calls it.
[00:57:21.227 --> 00:57:35.478]  And because in the UK, they've become very adept at strategic voting, so everybody on the web kind of shares information to try to swing local elections in a strategic way.
[00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:39.942]  So they might vote for somebody they don't really want, if it's strategic, toward a bigger goal.
[00:57:40.602 --> 00:57:42.683]  And the people have really organized themselves in this way.
[00:57:42.883 --> 00:57:52.529]  Now it's interesting, when the new coalition started, this Tory-Liberal-Democrat coalition, it was very interesting because they were the coalition government, they didn't have a majority.
[00:57:52.849 --> 00:57:58.692]  They had a problem because in the House of Lords they didn't have enough Lords to back up their proposals.
[00:57:58.752 --> 00:58:05.556]  So what they did yesterday is they simply, with a stroke of a pen, increased the number of Lords in the House of Lords by 100.
[00:58:06.796 --> 00:58:10.540]  Now, for anyone in the U.S., that would send a chill down your spine.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:17.926]  Because, of course, we fought a war to get rid of it, to escape the Lords in the House of Lords.
[00:58:18.306 --> 00:58:22.270]  But they're still active, and they're still part of a major government, the U.S.
[00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:22.690]  ally.
[00:58:22.850 --> 00:58:27.855]  That's where the Bank of England was established in 1694, which is... Plus, they're not hereditary Lords.
[00:58:28.315 --> 00:58:28.976]  They're not hereditary.
[00:58:29.176 --> 00:58:30.537]  Five more minutes with Max Keiser.
[00:58:30.897 --> 00:58:31.958]  Trade ahead, more of your calls.
[00:58:32.018 --> 00:58:32.439]  Thanks, Ian.
[00:58:36.633 --> 00:58:38.675]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.102]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:46.142 --> 00:58:48.944]  You've heard me talk about Cal Bend 5 Star Soaps for years.

[00:59:08.461 --> 00:59:14.665]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[00:59:42.769 --> 00:59:43.209]  Thank you.
[00:59:47.511 --> 00:59:49.452]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:49.893 --> 00:59:52.674]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:58.762]  Max Keiser is our guest for another five minutes.
[01:00:13.726 --> 01:00:19.070]  And we see the French government in trouble, the German government, the Greek government, the Icelandic government, the British government.
[01:00:19.391 --> 01:00:22.293]  The people are saying no to the banking dictatorship.
[01:00:22.313 --> 01:00:28.818]  There is a global rebellion, insurrection against the New World Order right as it's being born.
[01:00:29.279 --> 01:00:31.360]  As I've always said, dead on arrival.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:36.664]  A few final calls for Max Keiser and Gary Franchi coming up.
[01:00:36.745 --> 01:00:40.127]  Who is up next here on my phone list, John?
[01:00:41.929 --> 01:00:42.069]  Who?
[01:00:43.649 --> 01:00:44.469]  Okay, good.
[01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:45.910]  Stephen New York, you're on the air.
[01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:46.350]  Go ahead.
[01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:47.570]  Hello, Alex.
[01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:47.950]  How are you?
[01:00:48.191 --> 01:00:48.551]  Good, sir.
[01:00:49.051 --> 01:00:50.051]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:00:50.371 --> 01:00:56.793]  I'm really glad you made reference to Thomas Jefferson a few minutes ago, because my question has to do with two of our root problems.
[01:00:56.873 --> 01:01:05.576]  One of them is the dictatorship of the Federal Reserve, and the other happens to be the way we're decentralized and we don't have a common ground to make our voices heard.
[01:01:06.077 --> 01:01:12.899]  What if we drafted a new Declaration of Independence against the Federal Reserve, and we're able to be cosigners to it on Infowars.com?
[01:01:13.769 --> 01:01:18.674]  Given the fact that you have millions of listeners, what if we actually let our voices and our numbers be heard?
[01:01:18.894 --> 01:01:37.232]  Well, I think you think too much of me, but I am for, say, getting 15, 20 states who've got true anti-New World Order patriots in it, and then having a real constitutional convention with men of great gravitas and others there, and have it all televised, and then have them meet for a few months
[01:01:37.532 --> 01:01:40.914]  So the public could, you know, chime in almost like American Idol.
[01:01:41.194 --> 01:01:46.076]  Imagine the ratings this would get, you know, like to say what they wanted inside the Declaration of Independence.
[01:01:46.116 --> 01:01:54.040]  Of course, swearing allegiance to the previous system, but recodifying our independence against not King George III, but the banking cartel.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:02:01.944]  It'd be a great illustration and give an avenue of resistance and a focal point.
[01:02:02.004 --> 01:02:02.544]  Max Keiser.
[01:02:03.396 --> 01:02:04.757]  Well, I have a slightly different opinion.
[01:02:04.777 --> 01:02:11.259]  I mean, because this is basically a global problem, I think the Americans should approach it in that way.
[01:02:11.739 --> 01:02:28.525]  And for the caller that just called in, what I would think to do is to contact the people in Iceland and to contact the people in Greece and tell them you're behind them and that we have support in the global... I totally agree, Max, but if the New World Order falls here, it falls forever.
[01:02:30.233 --> 01:02:32.014]  This is like, this is like Leningrad.
[01:02:32.034 --> 01:02:33.315]  This is like Leningrad.
[01:02:33.335 --> 01:02:34.175]  Let me tell you something.
[01:02:34.235 --> 01:02:39.018]  Basically, you've already got some momentum going on right now.
[01:02:39.238 --> 01:02:41.160]  So, it'll come to the U.S.
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.540]  when it comes to the U.S.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.662]  But in the meantime, you've got Iceland and Greece are now joining.
[01:02:45.682 --> 01:02:47.323]  They're creating a new joint flag.
[01:02:47.343 --> 01:02:48.104]  The war is now.
[01:02:49.102 --> 01:02:50.042]  It's happening right now.
[01:02:50.142 --> 01:02:56.064]  So people, you know, during the... Remember Hemingway went to fight in Europe during the war.
[01:02:56.084 --> 01:02:57.204]  For whom the bell tolls.
[01:02:57.244 --> 01:02:57.945]  Just re-read it.
[01:02:57.985 --> 01:03:00.445]  Going to other places to fight wars abroad.
[01:03:00.505 --> 01:03:03.006]  Because they believe in a certain way that things should be done.
[01:03:03.046 --> 01:03:04.866]  Now there's a war going on right now in Greece.
[01:03:05.307 --> 01:03:10.008]  The Americans should be helping the Greeks fight the tyranny in Greece.
[01:03:10.288 --> 01:03:13.169]  That's the responsibility of every freedom-loving American.
[01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:14.989]  I agree with you.
[01:03:15.009 --> 01:03:16.710]  I just re-read for whom the bell tolls.
[01:03:18.007 --> 01:03:21.049]  As he lays there at the end with his heart beating against the pine needles.
[01:03:21.509 --> 01:03:22.570]  What a powerful book.
[01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:25.392]  Okay, well, the man is a man of principle.
[01:03:25.812 --> 01:03:29.934]  And where there's people out there who are, you know, that's what the U.S.
[01:03:30.014 --> 01:03:30.815]  used to stand for.
[01:03:30.855 --> 01:03:32.176]  Wherever there's tyranny, the U.S.
[01:03:32.216 --> 01:03:33.196]  went to put out the fire.
[01:03:33.216 --> 01:03:37.819]  Then along the way came, you know, the banking nightmare that we now know.
[01:03:38.019 --> 01:03:42.982]  But those people in Greece, the people in Iceland, the people in Portugal, the people in Spain, they need support.
[01:03:43.002 --> 01:03:44.023]  And we can help support them.
[01:03:44.123 --> 01:03:45.003]  I'm already in Europe.
[01:03:45.063 --> 01:03:46.044]  I'm already supporting them.
[01:03:46.084 --> 01:03:53.688]  You know, my YouTube, which I did on Al Jazeera English, has been translated into Greek, and it has now 400,000 views.
[01:03:53.929 --> 01:03:54.529]  You've done well.
[01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:55.810]  I know, you're having a great effect.
[01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:56.550]  Well, it's out there now.
[01:03:56.590 --> 01:04:02.834]  The Greek government is saying the exact same thing that was said in that video, that they want to go investigate the fraud.
[01:04:03.094 --> 01:04:05.875]  They want to look at the issues of transparency.
[01:04:06.256 --> 01:04:10.318]  And through back channels, I can tell you that there's some communication going on.
[01:04:10.878 --> 01:04:12.039]  The revolution's happening.
[01:04:12.159 --> 01:04:17.466]  No, I know, I'm in communication with the Greeks as well, and we're all working together and we commend you.
[01:04:17.846 --> 01:04:19.709]  I appreciate Steve's call.
[01:04:20.249 --> 01:04:24.715]  The point is, we're on the march, the empire is on the run, and we are out of time.
[01:04:25.296 --> 01:04:26.858]  What do you think about what's happening in Thailand?
[01:04:28.806 --> 01:04:29.707]  It's more of the same.
[01:04:30.027 --> 01:04:34.992]  You know, it's just a different flavor of the same ice cream store of fraud.
[01:04:35.613 --> 01:04:39.777]  And, you know, those folks are getting screwed just like the other folks in other countries.
[01:04:39.857 --> 01:04:41.659]  It's just a slightly different configuration.
[01:04:41.959 --> 01:04:43.160]  But the issues are the same.
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:45.602]  Those in power want to steal all the wealth.
[01:04:45.983 --> 01:04:49.686]  And the people who are workers and savers are getting... All right, we're out of time.
[01:04:49.967 --> 01:04:51.128]  Max, talk to you again soon.
[01:04:51.168 --> 01:04:51.728]  God bless you.
[01:04:51.928 --> 01:04:52.349]  All right, buddy.
[01:04:52.749 --> 01:04:53.250]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:54.482 --> 01:04:55.743]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:55.803 --> 01:05:01.145]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:05:01.385 --> 01:05:06.007]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:05:06.407 --> 01:05:06.807]  It's true.
[01:05:06.867 --> 01:05:11.429]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:05:11.969 --> 01:05:16.672]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:05:17.193 --> 01:05:19.114]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:05:19.494 --> 01:05:24.117]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:05:24.317 --> 01:05:25.218]  And here's the best part.
[01:05:25.418 --> 01:05:28.200]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:31.782]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:05:32.123 --> 01:05:34.964]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:05:35.305 --> 01:05:37.206]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:05:46.312 --> 01:05:50.835]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:05:51.155 --> 01:05:53.616]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:05:54.097 --> 01:06:01.821]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoodsDirect was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[01:06:02.102 --> 01:06:09.106]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[01:06:09.426 --> 01:06:16.231]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[01:06:16.411 --> 01:06:17.271]  Listen carefully.
[01:06:17.631 --> 01:06:27.138]  Starting immediately, efoodsdirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[01:06:27.358 --> 01:06:31.380]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.002]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of
[01:06:34.042 --> 01:06:34.643]  I think so.
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:55.082]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:55.122 --> 01:07:00.469]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:07:00.709 --> 01:07:05.335]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:07:05.736 --> 01:07:06.136]  It's true.
[01:07:06.216 --> 01:07:10.782]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:07:11.303 --> 01:07:15.986]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:07:16.527 --> 01:07:18.448]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.

[01:07:41.423 --> 01:07:42.444]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:07:42.844 --> 01:07:50.170]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:52.932]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:07:56.395 --> 01:08:02.420]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.023]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.578 --> 01:08:21.864]  The big S-E-I-U Obama Union that beats up Tea Party people and gets away with it has stormed the Bank of America, according to Business Insider and the Huffington Post.
[01:08:21.904 --> 01:08:26.066]  Bank of America protest, dozen storm bank branch in D.C.
[01:08:26.126 --> 01:08:29.208]  demanding bank re-regulation.
[01:08:29.248 --> 01:08:33.690]  But the bill was written by the big banks, just like the insurance companies wrote the insurance plan.
[01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:35.771]  And so you got Obama's people
[01:08:36.786 --> 01:08:50.280]  Preemptively stirring up a tax protest on banks, his hired henchmen, on record, commanded by the White House, are in there saying, let's get the banks!
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:51.301]  Federal Reserve Act of 1913!
[01:08:52.202 --> 01:08:52.983]  Same thing was done then.
[01:08:53.043 --> 01:08:53.783]  That'll get them!
[01:08:54.384 --> 01:08:55.285]  That'll teach them!
[01:08:55.745 --> 01:08:59.509]  Yeah, let them shut down all their competition that are local banks.
[01:09:00.677 --> 01:09:01.658]  We've gone over the bill here.
[01:09:01.698 --> 01:09:08.241]  It's been mainstream news that every transaction you make, everything in your account, live time, controlled by the feds, oh, that's really good.
[01:09:09.121 --> 01:09:11.763]  That's another bait and switch by these people.
[01:09:11.823 --> 01:09:15.985]  And it's the same type of tricks over and over and over again.
[01:09:18.618 --> 01:09:20.239]  Why can't people get more sophisticated?
[01:09:20.259 --> 01:09:25.161]  I guess they are starting to get more sophisticated, but we don't have time for an education curve here, folks.
[01:09:25.482 --> 01:09:27.383]  This is crash course in brain surgery.
[01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:30.164]  And I know my general audience is smarter than I am in most respects.
[01:09:30.204 --> 01:09:31.505]  I'm not talking to my old listeners.
[01:09:31.805 --> 01:09:35.387]  I'm talking about new people tuning in and these idiots with these unions.
[01:09:36.367 --> 01:09:37.468]  Oh, God.
[01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.950]  I mean, it's like...
[01:09:42.153 --> 01:09:44.094]  Grayson is saying we've defeated the Fed.
[01:09:44.594 --> 01:09:53.276]  Oh yeah, it's just taken over right now by changing Ron Paul's bill in the Senate and then telling people with Bernie Sanders that it's a defeat of the Federal Reserve.
[01:09:53.476 --> 01:09:53.877]  Bull!
[01:09:55.057 --> 01:10:01.239]  Goldman Sachs being investigated by the Feds, it's almost completely Goldman Sachs that run all the federal regulatory agencies.
[01:10:02.099 --> 01:10:05.020]  They're going to burn some mid-level trailer on Timberwolf.
[01:10:06.723 --> 01:10:08.584]  They're giving the dog a bone, folks.
[01:10:08.744 --> 01:10:10.245]  They're giving the dog a bone.
[01:10:10.605 --> 01:10:12.106]  We're going to continue with your calls this hour.
[01:10:12.146 --> 01:10:17.349]  Webster Tarpley pops in for only five minutes with his inside take on what's happening in Thailand for the rest of the hour.
[01:10:17.629 --> 01:10:24.414]  We're joined by Gary Franchi on state's rights, on taking our counties and cities back, on having real sustainable local communities.
[01:10:25.094 --> 01:10:28.676]  You know, not globalist takeover sustainability.
[01:10:29.116 --> 01:10:37.519]  It's all covered in Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic with Michael Bagnerik, myself, Richard Mack, Charles Key, and many, many others.
[01:10:37.579 --> 01:10:41.381]  The DVD has been shipping out since Friday at Infowars.com.
[01:10:41.401 --> 01:10:43.922]  The trailers are up at Infowars.com.
[01:10:44.562 --> 01:10:48.683]  Gary Franchi, of course, the Lone Lantern Society and Restore the Republic.
[01:10:48.723 --> 01:10:49.383]  He took that over.
[01:10:49.483 --> 01:10:55.884]  He was the second in command there when Aaron Russo died and the great work he was doing with his movement to end the Fed.
[01:10:56.304 --> 01:10:57.864]  Of course, America, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:10:57.904 --> 01:11:00.545]  He produced the film with William Lewis.
[01:11:01.245 --> 01:11:07.766]  And we are honored to have Gary Franchi here with us today to talk about everything that's happening.
[01:11:07.786 --> 01:11:08.566]  Gary, good to have you.
[01:11:09.427 --> 01:11:10.607]  Alex, it's a pleasure to be here.
[01:11:10.647 --> 01:11:11.407]  Thanks for having me back.
[01:11:12.318 --> 01:11:14.640]  Well, I mean, so much is going on, so much is happening.
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:16.341]  The solution is this film.
[01:11:17.142 --> 01:11:20.444]  You can hand this to somebody, the difference between a republic and a democracy.
[01:11:21.985 --> 01:11:27.569]  Break it down for folks why they need to get and have viewing parties and show it to everyone they know.
[01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:29.511]  Rise of the Republic.
[01:11:29.571 --> 01:11:30.271]  Don't tread on me.
[01:11:31.209 --> 01:11:36.235]  Well, you know, Alex, the reason we made this film is because so often we're asked, well, where are the solutions?
[01:11:36.255 --> 01:11:39.218]  You know, all I hear is the problem, the problem, the problem.
[01:11:40.039 --> 01:11:42.181]  So that's why we set out to make this film.
[01:11:42.201 --> 01:11:46.606]  And it's sort of like a, it's like an unofficial sequel to Camp FEMA, if you would.
[01:11:46.626 --> 01:11:49.990]  Because if you're watching the end of Camp FEMA, we start to go into states' rights.
[01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:50.670]  And
[01:11:51.631 --> 01:11:55.376]  I got the idea one night when I was watching and screening Camfima once again.
[01:11:55.396 --> 01:11:58.659]  I said, you know, we really got to expound on this issue.
[01:11:58.699 --> 01:12:11.514]  We got to expound upon the Tenth Amendment and really give people the information that they need so that they can introduce the legislation that we talk about in the film that can really put teeth into the Tenth Amendment.
[01:12:12.154 --> 01:12:36.493]  uh... that can reign in the federal government and also expose the different methods the federal government uses to reign in the states you know that we call it the choke collar that uh... that the federal government uses also not just it's not just about states rights but we also talk about empowering the individual or with the second amendment what that really means and we we'd we'd talk to uh... edwin viera about the constitutional militia
[01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:45.222]  We talked to Charles Key in Oklahoma, one of the big proponents of the Tenth Amendment, spearheading the Tenth Amendment movement in this country.
[01:12:45.763 --> 01:12:52.010]  So it's really just an excellent cross-section of movements, action, and what people can do to take back this country.
[01:12:52.190 --> 01:12:52.790]  And history!
[01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:53.371]  And history!
[01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:57.375]  I mean, over and over again you explain the difference between a republic and a democracy.
[01:12:57.415 --> 01:12:58.256]  Break it down for folks.
[01:12:58.897 --> 01:13:00.679]  Well, most folks don't even realize it.
[01:13:01.019 --> 01:13:04.082]  You ask the average person on the street, they say, well, we are a democracy.
[01:13:04.102 --> 01:13:04.763]  And you say, no, no, no.
[01:13:04.983 --> 01:13:05.704]  We are a republic.
[01:13:05.724 --> 01:13:06.645]  We are based on laws.
[01:13:06.665 --> 01:13:11.890]  Democracy is what is so often referred to as, you know, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:13:12.271 --> 01:13:13.792]  You know, majority rules.
[01:13:13.852 --> 01:13:15.454]  And that's not necessarily the case here.
[01:13:15.994 --> 01:13:18.095]  It is the law that is in control.
[01:13:18.115 --> 01:13:21.177]  It's the Constitution that is the foundation for this country.
[01:13:21.457 --> 01:13:22.497]  And that's what the film's about.
[01:13:22.537 --> 01:13:24.618]  It's about restoring the constitutional values of this nation.
[01:13:24.639 --> 01:13:26.239]  Yeah, democracy is very dangerous.
[01:13:26.299 --> 01:13:31.642]  I mean, if you have a democracy, I want to go back to Greece 2,400 years ago.
[01:13:32.302 --> 01:13:35.044]  Only the elite families had voting.
[01:13:35.504 --> 01:13:37.185]  And they would go up to the top of a hill.
[01:13:37.405 --> 01:13:38.125]  This is on record.
[01:13:38.165 --> 01:13:40.987]  They had a bucket for black rocks, a bucket for white rocks.
[01:13:41.727 --> 01:14:04.651]  And a white rock was a yay, a black rock was a nay, and that was the first parliamentary procedure, and they had a little amphitheater, and there was a cliff about a hundred yards away, and this is historical fact, and they had different voting centers, and routinely they'd have a vote on, we're mad at this philosopher, he's calling, you know, for overthrowing our corrupt system, and they would vote to kill him or not, and they'd go throw him off the cliff.
[01:14:05.331 --> 01:14:06.352]  Or chop his head off.
[01:14:06.732 --> 01:14:17.082]  So, in a democracy, if you can get 51% to vote to steal somebody's ranch, or farm, or business, or make them pay more taxes, then you can do it.
[01:14:17.362 --> 01:14:21.285]  In a democracy, in a republic, everyone is protected by that Bill of Rights.
[01:14:21.405 --> 01:14:23.587]  And nothing, nothing can overturn it.
[01:14:23.928 --> 01:14:26.070]  And if someone tries to, they are a tyrant!
[01:14:27.048 --> 01:14:30.709]  Right, it doesn't matter if you're a minority or a majority in the population.
[01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:37.412]  It is the law and it is the rights that are inherent in the Constitution that allow us to have the freedom.
[01:14:37.672 --> 01:14:45.255]  Well, let's just point out our inalienable rights, absolutely, that exist as the Ninth Amendment states, that exist before this compact.
[01:14:45.615 --> 01:14:52.558]  This is just a statement of the already observed liberties of the free humans on this planet.
[01:14:53.612 --> 01:14:54.734]  Well, you're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:14:54.874 --> 01:15:01.083]  And, you know, the film itself, I love the video you made.
[01:15:01.925 --> 01:15:05.690]  You kind of smirked in the video and you said the Southern Poverty Law Center is really going to love this film.
[01:15:07.881 --> 01:15:10.404]  Camp FEMA was out there for them, apparently.
[01:15:11.005 --> 01:15:14.730]  But this film is really going to get under their skin, and we're going to send them an autographed copy.
[01:15:15.411 --> 01:15:22.620]  Well, for those that don't know, on CNN and other channels, they've been demonizing Camp FEMA, and the Southern Poverty Law Center's been demonizing it.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.663]  So yeah, if they didn't like that, they're really not going to like this.
[01:15:26.465 --> 01:15:27.305]  No, absolutely not.
[01:15:27.325 --> 01:15:35.349]  I mean, well, look, they want to put out, you know, this rage on the right and the rise of the right, these dis-info pieces out there.
[01:15:35.449 --> 01:15:37.150]  This is the rise of the republic!
[01:15:37.730 --> 01:15:38.251]  Absolutely.
[01:15:38.391 --> 01:15:39.511]  This is the rise of the republic.
[01:15:39.551 --> 01:15:40.632]  We're documenting it here.
[01:15:41.292 --> 01:15:44.234]  And I want people to know that they can make copies of this film.
[01:15:44.254 --> 01:15:47.775]  They make, purchase a copy, make copies, pass it out hand-to-hand.
[01:15:48.155 --> 01:15:50.937]  It's the viral distribution that's going to get this message to the American people.
[01:15:51.633 --> 01:15:54.715]  Well, you've done well, Gary, and so has William Lewis.
[01:15:54.876 --> 01:16:16.733]  I want to play a clip here to illustrate the difference between a mainline moron that doesn't know the Bill of Rights and Constitution, Miss Teen South Carolina a few years ago, versus Miss Oklahoma, Morgan Elizabeth Woollard, the difference between an informed patriot woman and a dingbat educated in the public school system.
[01:16:17.193 --> 01:16:20.056]  Let's go to Miss Teen South Carolina first.
[01:16:24.141 --> 01:16:26.642]  A fifth of Americans can't locate the U.S.
[01:16:26.722 --> 01:16:27.482]  on a world map.
[01:16:28.282 --> 01:16:29.302]  Why do you think this is?
[01:16:31.623 --> 01:16:34.363]  I personally believe that U.S.
[01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:46.306]  Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't have maps and I believe that our education, like such a
[01:16:46.886 --> 01:16:56.795]  South Africa and the Iraq everywhere like such us and I believe that they should our education over here in the U.S.
[01:16:56.835 --> 01:16:58.056]  should help the U.S.
[01:16:58.256 --> 01:17:06.284]  or should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries so we will be able to build up our future for our
[01:17:07.145 --> 01:17:08.866]  Thank you very much, South Carolina.
[01:17:09.566 --> 01:17:14.289]  Listen how she just mindlessly spewed a bunch of political correct words.
[01:17:14.349 --> 01:17:16.150]  Help the children, help South Africa.
[01:17:16.170 --> 01:17:19.771]  You know, the struggle of the 80s or whatever that was the cause of the lab.
[01:17:20.072 --> 01:17:23.453]  Now let's hear with the USA pageant.
[01:17:23.834 --> 01:17:29.176]  Last night, Miss Oklahoma getting a big cheer when she talked about states' rights.
[01:17:29.596 --> 01:17:33.879]  This is an intelligent woman versus the product of the New World Order.
[01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:34.259]  Here it is.
[01:17:35.154 --> 01:17:36.855]  Oscar Nunez, your question, please.
[01:17:38.415 --> 01:17:38.795]  Hello, Ms.
[01:17:38.875 --> 01:17:39.195]  O'Connell.
[01:17:39.215 --> 01:17:39.755]  How are you?
[01:17:40.216 --> 01:17:40.896]  I'm doing so great.
[01:17:40.956 --> 01:17:41.436]  Thank you.
[01:17:41.736 --> 01:17:42.056]  Alrighty.
[01:17:42.556 --> 01:17:51.399]  Arizona's new immigration statute authorizes law enforcement authorities to check the citizenship of anyone they believe may be in the country illegally.
[01:17:51.419 --> 01:17:53.800]  Now, listen to the question before you move.
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:59.661]  Critics say this may amount to racial profiling.
[01:18:00.302 --> 01:18:04.723]  Do you think that this should be mandated by the state or by the federal government?
[01:18:06.934 --> 01:18:09.076]  I'm a huge believer in states' rights.
[01:18:09.176 --> 01:18:11.538]  I think that's what's so wonderful about America.
[01:18:19.424 --> 01:18:22.987]  So I think it's perfectly fine for Arizona to create that law.
[01:18:24.028 --> 01:18:28.151]  And I am against illegal immigration, but I'm also against racial profiling.
[01:18:28.431 --> 01:18:29.893]  So I see both sides in this issue.
[01:18:33.246 --> 01:18:34.406]  Okay, so there you go.
[01:18:34.607 --> 01:18:37.128]  He was trying to cue them to boo her.
[01:18:37.268 --> 01:18:38.188]  Don't boo yet.
[01:18:38.808 --> 01:18:39.769]  And they didn't boo.
[01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:41.149]  They cheered her.
[01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:45.031]  And so again, and they tried to misconstrue what this law does.
[01:18:45.851 --> 01:18:52.474]  It only allows after first contact, say with a drunk driver, if they're not a citizen to enforce the law,
[01:18:53.354 --> 01:19:00.959]  And then meanwhile, citizens have checkpoints, the feds are funding everywhere, Gary Franchi, and I never hear Barack Obama decrying that.
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:04.762]  I want equal protection under the law, but what an illustration, Gary.
[01:19:05.563 --> 01:19:07.524]  Yeah, that was a beautiful answer, you know.
[01:19:07.744 --> 01:19:10.926]  I was cracking up when I heard the first girl.
[01:19:12.127 --> 01:19:13.008]  Classic clip there.
[01:19:13.908 --> 01:19:16.410]  The second clip, though, just stellar response.
[01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:16.991]  Beautiful.
[01:19:17.831 --> 01:19:21.634]  But that's the difference between a patriot and a dingbat who doesn't even know what planet she's on.
[01:19:22.304 --> 01:19:23.225]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:24.566 --> 01:19:27.168]  Well, there's nothing better than an intelligent, beautiful woman.
[01:19:27.208 --> 01:19:27.608]  I love it.
[01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:30.931]  And more and more of them are standing up and taking action, Gary.
[01:19:31.191 --> 01:19:33.973]  When we come back, just for a quick segment, you'll be on with us.
[01:19:34.333 --> 01:19:39.177]  I'm going to get Webster Tarpley's take on what's happening in Bangkok, Thailand right now.
[01:19:39.918 --> 01:19:42.420]  Patriots or banker-funded uprising.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.481]  People fighting back with slingshots against
[01:19:45.538 --> 01:19:52.084]  M16s, I tend to lean towards them, but we've got to burrow into exactly what's happening here with Gary Franchi.
[01:19:52.124 --> 01:19:54.486]  Webster Tartley on for one segment.
[01:19:55.026 --> 01:19:57.308]  They helped to create a new world order.
[01:19:57.328 --> 01:19:59.630]  We are part of a new world order.
[01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:02.172]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[01:20:02.933 --> 01:20:07.697]  Invisible empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:20:08.037 --> 01:20:12.241]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:14.882]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:20:14.902 --> 01:20:17.403]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:20:17.423 --> 01:20:20.344]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:20:20.684 --> 01:20:28.287]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:20:28.627 --> 01:20:33.872]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:20:34.032 --> 01:20:36.295]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:20:36.335 --> 01:20:40.299]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:20:40.559 --> 01:20:41.480]  And I got news for you.
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:42.941]  You're everyone else.
[01:20:42.981 --> 01:20:43.962]  Invisible Empire.

[01:21:16.223 --> 01:21:16.583]  I think so.

[01:24:03.999 --> 01:24:17.303]  But for just five minutes, historian and good friend of mine, Webster Griffin Tarpley, pops in with us to give us his take on what's happening in Thailand.
[01:24:17.583 --> 01:24:17.903]  Webster.
[01:24:19.062 --> 01:24:23.005]  Alex, I think Thailand is basically a mess, and here's what it is.
[01:24:23.045 --> 01:24:24.286]  You have these two parties, right?
[01:24:24.307 --> 01:24:33.995]  You have the red shirts who demand the return of the exiled Prime Minister Thaksin, and they've been engaging in some protest, but also some violence.
[01:24:34.615 --> 01:24:41.057]  Then you have the government, which is this guy Abhisit, representing the privileged classes, basically.
[01:24:41.457 --> 01:24:46.798]  You have to remember that in Thailand, the army is traditionally a big political power, and you have a monarchy.
[01:24:46.879 --> 01:24:54.201]  You have King Bhumibol, who is now pretty old, but he was quite a firm hand over quite a few decades.
[01:24:54.301 --> 01:24:59.142]  Now, Thaksin, the exiled guy that the redshirts want to bring back,
[01:24:59.722 --> 01:25:03.724]  When he was in power from 2001 to 2006, he did some good things.
[01:25:03.764 --> 01:25:07.685]  He got the International Monetary Fund out of the country, always good.
[01:25:08.105 --> 01:25:09.766]  He instituted a healthcare system.
[01:25:10.206 --> 01:25:13.227]  He also gave farmers a moratorium on debt.
[01:25:13.267 --> 01:25:15.007]  They got debt relief from this guy.
[01:25:15.748 --> 01:25:19.009]  The problem with this is that the red shirts of today
[01:25:19.873 --> 01:25:20.574]  We're good.
[01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:42.694]  Thailand is one of the string of pearls, one of the countries that China would like to have good relations with.
[01:25:43.195 --> 01:25:50.060]  China wants stability, they want predictability, they're willing to compromise with some pretty ugly people.
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:52.442]  So more Western encirclement of China.
[01:25:53.475 --> 01:25:54.115]  I'm not sure.
[01:25:54.175 --> 01:25:55.756]  Look, it's a little bit more complicated.
[01:25:55.796 --> 01:25:57.116]  Here's what I would say right now.
[01:25:57.416 --> 01:26:03.078]  If you look at the Chinese coverage on Thailand, they don't seem to choose sides very clearly.
[01:26:03.138 --> 01:26:07.999]  What they do is deplore the fact that the society is breaking down, right?
[01:26:08.019 --> 01:26:15.281]  That democracy has failed, that you've got essentially the breakdown of the political system, and you're headed for chaos.
[01:26:15.341 --> 01:26:22.063]  And I would also stress, the world economic depression in the background is fueling chaos in many countries.
[01:26:22.603 --> 01:26:27.666]  So with this, you might say that Thailand is on its way to being some kind of a permanently failed state.
[01:26:28.346 --> 01:26:33.429]  The Wall Street Journal of this morning wants the existing government to step down, to resign.
[01:26:33.489 --> 01:26:34.370]  So that's clear enough.
[01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:41.974]  But I think they want that with the idea that Thailand will descend into chaos, and that will become a problem for China, right?
[01:26:42.034 --> 01:26:44.815]  Chaos, refugees, and so forth.
[01:26:44.875 --> 01:26:47.797]  So again, I think this is really, really a mess.
[01:26:49.548 --> 01:26:51.169]  Alright, we've got about two minutes left.
[01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:53.030]  We haven't talked to you in about a week.
[01:26:53.311 --> 01:27:01.556]  The deterioration with the Euro, with Germany now threatening to pull out or issue a new mark state.
[01:27:01.596 --> 01:27:02.437]  Where do you see that going?
[01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:06.405]  Well, this is also chaos now, but this is very clear.
[01:27:06.445 --> 01:27:07.966]  This is the attack of the hedge funds.
[01:27:08.406 --> 01:27:14.768]  The hedge fund hyenas using credit default swap derivatives are continuing to attack Greece and the Euro.
[01:27:14.808 --> 01:27:19.950]  And the thing that the Europeans have got to do is pull themselves together, kick out the US hedge funds,
[01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.810]  Well said.
[01:27:20.910 --> 01:27:27.812]  Are things deteriorating more quickly than they were last week or any other developments on the economic front?
[01:27:45.239 --> 01:27:49.885]  Well, you know, you've got the continued pressure, right?
[01:27:49.945 --> 01:27:52.789]  And it's essentially a bunch of shorts, right?
[01:27:52.809 --> 01:27:54.211]  People are shorting the euro.
[01:27:54.712 --> 01:27:58.156]  And again, nowadays, they don't do a sort of old-fashioned short.
[01:27:58.196 --> 01:27:59.698]  They do the credit default swap.
[01:28:00.279 --> 01:28:01.220]  We're good to go.
[01:28:18.199 --> 01:28:20.581]  Well, that came out with Iceland.
[01:28:20.661 --> 01:28:26.846]  Once they had said no, the books got opened and it turned out it was the banks that were in trouble and that Iceland didn't know the money.
[01:28:26.866 --> 01:28:32.971]  In the last minute, a little silly side note, but I want to correct it if it's wrong because I got a few emails and saw a YouTube comment.
[01:28:33.592 --> 01:28:37.075]  I had read a book that you had written on history.
[01:28:37.615 --> 01:28:42.897]  And I had read that you had a doctorate in history, and so I called you Dr. Tarpley.
[01:28:43.518 --> 01:28:45.899]  And I'd read that in other books that were mentioning you.
[01:28:45.979 --> 01:28:48.380]  You'd never really talked about it, but you are a doctor, correct?
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:48.960]  Yes, right.
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:56.903]  A PhD in history from Catholic University of America, a specialty in the Venetian history of the 17th century.
[01:28:57.383 --> 01:29:02.986]  And if you want to go to WorldCat, the world library catalog, you can see my
[01:29:04.296 --> 01:29:09.078]  Sure, and you're a Fulbright scholar and have a bunch of other degrees and are a great scholar.
[01:29:09.098 --> 01:29:13.800]  I'm just tired of people making stuff up because I knew you had a doctorate of history.
[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:14.640]  The one thing is I don't.
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:16.921]  I have a doctorate in history and that's it.
[01:29:16.941 --> 01:29:18.562]  That's the one that I have.
[01:29:18.602 --> 01:29:19.402]  I don't have any others.
[01:29:19.722 --> 01:29:21.303]  Okay, not a big issue.
[01:29:21.343 --> 01:29:27.708]  What matters is your predictions, the books you've written, have all come true, and that's why we have you on here almost on a weekly basis.
[01:29:28.008 --> 01:29:30.990]  And all four of your books are available at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:31.211 --> 01:29:33.492]  Webster, great having you on with us, Dr. Tarpley.
[01:29:34.173 --> 01:29:35.153]  Alright, thank you so much.
[01:29:35.213 --> 01:29:36.875]  See folks, it didn't make it up, okay?
[01:29:37.455 --> 01:29:43.179]  I was reading another history book that was quoting Dr. Tarpley in it and mentioned his degree in Venetian banking history.
[01:29:44.961 --> 01:29:45.861]  We're on the march.
[01:29:46.342 --> 01:29:47.863]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.861 --> 01:29:51.558]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:11.732]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.

[01:31:29.825 --> 01:31:35.971]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:31:36.571 --> 01:31:39.993]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:58.592]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[01:31:58.913 --> 01:31:59.233]  Fact.
[01:31:59.433 --> 01:32:02.798]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[01:32:03.138 --> 01:32:03.439]  Fact.

[01:32:09.266 --> 01:32:09.527]  Fact.

[01:32:14.069 --> 01:32:14.409]  Fact!

[01:32:41.323 --> 01:32:42.625]  That's 1-800-973-1486 or go to ResearchedHerbs.com.
[01:32:42.645 --> 01:32:43.827]  All the goodness with none of the side effects.
[01:33:07.569 --> 01:33:09.290]  I was a prisoner of doubt!
[01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:10.870]  Not anymore!
[01:33:19.174 --> 01:33:20.955]  I'll take my chances on the Republic!
[01:33:24.676 --> 01:33:25.737]  Deal me in!
[01:33:31.388 --> 01:33:38.254]  Alright, I got some key news I want to hit with Gary Franchi and talk more about the film Don't Jot On Me, Rise of the Republic, and Take Your Phone Calls.
[01:33:39.655 --> 01:33:46.081]  I reserved comment about the police killing a seven-year-old girl serving a warrant in Detroit.
[01:33:47.262 --> 01:33:49.283]  I wanted to give this time, I do this a lot.
[01:33:51.005 --> 01:33:53.267]  Before I got into it, I wanted to give it some time.
[01:33:53.507 --> 01:33:55.008]  Didn't even take a day to come out.
[01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:58.872]  But the police basically killed her in cold blood.
[01:34:00.029 --> 01:34:01.929]  A lot of these people that join SWAT teams are idiots.
[01:34:02.930 --> 01:34:03.850]  And they use them too much.
[01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:06.370]  And we've talked about that.
[01:34:07.051 --> 01:34:09.951]  Turns out they killed her and lied about it, as usual.
[01:34:10.611 --> 01:34:12.612]  They had an A&E film crew with them.
[01:34:12.652 --> 01:34:14.452]  They were going to be big movie stars.
[01:34:16.813 --> 01:34:18.753]  They weren't even in the house when they shot her.
[01:34:19.393 --> 01:34:21.934]  And they knew there was a film crew and they lied about it.
[01:34:22.354 --> 01:34:24.754]  I mean, I'm going to talk about it with Gary Franchi in a moment.
[01:34:25.235 --> 01:34:26.875]  Also, speaking of lying,
[01:34:27.998 --> 01:34:34.141]  We have caught the Texas Film Commission lying yet again.
[01:34:35.522 --> 01:34:41.045]  We pulled up mainstream news articles where they admit the Texas Film Commission is funding the film Machete.
[01:34:41.325 --> 01:34:43.926]  Hey, Robert Rodriguez can make his race war film for Division.
[01:34:45.067 --> 01:34:47.188]  But I have free speech to speak out against it.
[01:34:47.508 --> 01:34:50.710]  And we called the Film Commission and they said, yes, we're funding it with state money.
[01:34:50.930 --> 01:34:52.311]  I know all his films are funded with it.
[01:34:53.291 --> 01:34:55.432]  Then we had the Press Secretary call us Friday.
[01:34:55.512 --> 01:34:58.734]  We talked to her, Rick Perry's office, saying it wasn't true.
[01:34:58.994 --> 01:35:05.978]  And we added her comment to our article that went viral and was in the New York newspapers, the Washington Post, and everywhere else.
[01:35:07.339 --> 01:35:09.080]  Drudge Report, on and on, Washington Post.
[01:35:11.141 --> 01:35:15.904]  We added that to that article and got played by Rick Perry again.
[01:35:16.784 --> 01:35:17.745]  They're lying about it.
[01:35:18.605 --> 01:35:21.087]  And I have the San Antonio Express News from a year ago.
[01:35:22.426 --> 01:35:30.610]  I have Slackerwood, I have other mainstream news articles, where they have the film commission at meetings and the head of the film commission saying they're funding it.
[01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:32.771]  Of course they're funding the stinking thing!
[01:35:32.971 --> 01:35:35.612]  We called there and they admitted it before we wrote the story!
[01:35:36.612 --> 01:35:38.833]  What do you think, we just make stuff up around here?
[01:35:38.853 --> 01:35:41.414]  Rob Doo got on the stinking telephone!
[01:35:41.474 --> 01:35:42.935]  Alright, I'm sorry, I want to go to Gary Franchi.
[01:35:44.156 --> 01:35:46.917]  Let me plug the sponsors, we're going to them here, I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:35:46.937 --> 01:35:49.418]  Uh, efoodsdirect.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:51.343 --> 01:35:59.026]  Folks, don't forget that it is important to have your own storable food in these insane times in case we go into a complete collapse type scenario.
[01:35:59.046 --> 01:36:05.188]  They have the highest quality, freshly made, best prices, biggest company out there, longest continually operating.
[01:36:05.789 --> 01:36:07.449]  There's a lot of dangerous crud out there.
[01:36:07.489 --> 01:36:08.570]  There's some good outfits as well.
[01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:10.050]  I'm just telling you, this is a sure deal.
[01:36:10.410 --> 01:36:11.531]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:36:11.591 --> 01:36:13.051]  Never stand a bread line, you have your own bread.

[01:36:13.132 --> 01:36:13.312]  800-409-5633.
[01:36:13.332 --> 01:36:14.112]  The letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[01:36:19.654 --> 01:36:21.255]  Banners up on InfoWars.com.
[01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:21.835]  I wouldn't wait.
[01:36:21.855 --> 01:36:24.796]  They've got month's supplies, year's supplies, special food diets.
[01:36:25.756 --> 01:36:28.037]  Non-GMO, non-hybrid, eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:36:28.077 --> 01:36:31.838]  And finally, AcolaBlue.com, talking about getting off the grid.
[01:36:31.878 --> 01:36:35.839]  They have little solar panel systems that you can buy with it, and it grabs
[01:36:36.619 --> 01:36:39.860]  Water out of the air, that's what clouds are, and precipitates it.
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:41.481]  Their smallest unit, 7 gallons a day.
[01:36:41.521 --> 01:36:42.961]  Their next unit, 8 gallons a day.
[01:36:42.981 --> 01:36:45.042]  7 to 12 filters, depending on what unit.
[01:36:45.062 --> 01:36:47.202]  They've got big units that can supply thousands.
[01:36:47.823 --> 01:36:48.423]  They've got it all.
[01:36:48.503 --> 01:36:49.523]  Ecolablue.com.

[01:36:51.644 --> 01:36:52.604]  Ecolablue.com or 800-691-6043.
[01:36:55.425 --> 01:36:58.466]  Stop drinking the fluoride rat water that they feed us in the cities.
[01:36:59.387 --> 01:37:02.468]  Well water is usually good, but not always, especially if it's a shallow well.
[01:37:02.768 --> 01:37:03.948]  You need the backup at ColorBlue.com 800-691-6043.
[01:37:03.988 --> 01:37:04.268]  Okay.
[01:37:04.288 --> 01:37:05.209]  I want to go back to Gary Franchi.
[01:37:09.344 --> 01:37:11.805]  Gary, this type of stuff makes me really, really angry.
[01:37:12.126 --> 01:37:15.848]  Police, A&E video crew at site of child shooting.
[01:37:16.368 --> 01:37:30.856]  The headline should be, this is from WLNSTV News 6, this should be police caught lying, because I have the other articles from CNN, you name it, where the cops were saying it was an accident, that the mother jumped on them, and all these other lies.
[01:37:31.357 --> 01:37:37.040]  The A&E footage, the crime show, the first 48, shows a shot fired
[01:37:38.439 --> 01:37:54.147]  After police threw a flashbang inside the home, and I have other articles on this, seconds after, they flow a flashbang in, a cop... I've seen Texas cases where they shoot their own cop in the back, and then frame the guy inside the house who didn't even have guns, until a SWAT team guy told the truth.
[01:37:54.467 --> 01:37:57.028]  But I mean, it's just... It's insane!
[01:37:57.048 --> 01:37:58.749]  Uh, Gary Franchi, your take on this?
[01:37:58.769 --> 01:38:01.210]  You know, why were they going in the house in the first place?
[01:38:02.011 --> 01:38:02.331]  Do we know?
[01:38:03.365 --> 01:38:08.647]  Oh, they claimed that they were serving a murder investigation warrant, but it turns out that the person wasn't there.
[01:38:09.645 --> 01:38:18.949]  Okay, so they obviously didn't bother to do any proper surveillance or do their homework and said they barge into the house and they shoot this young girl.
[01:38:19.049 --> 01:38:19.809]  Is that the story then?
[01:38:20.049 --> 01:38:22.971]  Yeah, killed her, got her in a hammer, shot her in the neck, blew her head off basically.
[01:38:23.531 --> 01:38:24.051]  Oh God.
[01:38:25.191 --> 01:38:29.733]  Alex, this is... I'm sorry, this is a terrible tragedy.
[01:38:30.334 --> 01:38:30.714]  I'm sorry.
[01:38:30.954 --> 01:38:32.514]  It's disgusting and despicable.
[01:38:33.315 --> 01:38:36.416]  I know we're talking about states' rights here, but this is a local
[01:38:39.195 --> 01:38:39.775]  Police, right?
[01:38:39.916 --> 01:38:40.436]  Local SWATs?
[01:38:40.456 --> 01:38:40.536]  Yes.
[01:38:44.439 --> 01:38:45.480]  What's going to happen to these guys?
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:46.601]  Are they going to get promoted?
[01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:48.122]  They'll probably get a medal, yeah.
[01:38:49.781 --> 01:38:50.321]  Unbelievable.
[01:38:50.882 --> 01:39:03.749]  Well, my issue is we've all seen them killing dogs in houses for a gram of marijuana, and that's basically, I've been corrected, that's two marijuana cigarettes, and they just shoot the corgi and the bulldog, and it's basically funny to them.
[01:39:04.110 --> 01:39:07.151]  This is the phony drug war, which again is another states' rights issue.
[01:39:07.452 --> 01:39:14.016]  Fourteen states are trying to decriminalize, do the same thing so we don't collapse like Mexico or China with their past drug wars.
[01:39:14.536 --> 01:39:17.498]  Again, let's get into that along the lines of Don't Tread on Me.
[01:39:18.735 --> 01:39:23.877]  Well, what I'm concerned with here is the overuse of aggression by police.
[01:39:23.937 --> 01:39:25.038]  I mean, you're seeing it.
[01:39:25.418 --> 01:39:26.699]  There is an upward trend of this.
[01:39:26.779 --> 01:39:31.121]  I mean, they're kicking in people's doors for, you know, a couple of marijuana cigarettes.
[01:39:31.381 --> 01:39:41.365]  They're tasering people at police checkpoints or just standard traffic stops because somebody doesn't want to sign their rights away on a ticket.
[01:39:43.026 --> 01:39:44.407]  It's absurd the amount of
[01:39:45.984 --> 01:39:48.025]  Look, the American people are fed up.
[01:39:48.946 --> 01:39:50.907]  And we document in the film.
[01:39:50.947 --> 01:39:55.550]  I mean, it all comes back to what's going on at the local level, at the state level.
[01:39:56.671 --> 01:39:58.952]  We need to get the American people fired up.
[01:39:59.433 --> 01:40:00.794]  We need to take this country back.
[01:40:03.056 --> 01:40:05.498]  What side of the line are you going to stand on?
[01:40:05.778 --> 01:40:11.703]  I mean, how much abuse are the American people going to take before we just say enough is enough?
[01:40:11.743 --> 01:40:15.866]  I mean, the Greeks over there... I have family in Greece right now.
[01:40:17.075 --> 01:40:18.356]  Who cannot leave Greece.
[01:40:18.876 --> 01:40:27.559]  They're locked in their homes because people are rioting in the streets because of the socialist tactics of the international bankers that are going on right now.
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:29.720]  And it's going to happen here.
[01:40:30.521 --> 01:40:31.701]  But we don't want that to happen.
[01:40:32.822 --> 01:40:34.042]  The American people have to rise up.
[01:40:36.443 --> 01:40:40.827]  Dealing with states' rights that are covered in the film Don't Tread on Me, so people understand this is the key.
[01:40:41.327 --> 01:40:46.892]  What's your view on the Arizona law, A, and B, have you seen my coverage of Machete?
[01:40:47.272 --> 01:40:51.356]  We've gotten the script, and it clearly is trying to invoke a race war.
[01:40:51.476 --> 01:40:52.937]  Again, more divide and conquer.
[01:40:53.858 --> 01:40:58.122]  Well, the Arizona law, in my opinion, it's needed.
[01:40:58.502 --> 01:40:59.103]  It is needed.
[01:41:00.304 --> 01:41:03.767]  As far as the first contact situation with the police,
[01:41:04.515 --> 01:41:08.659]  All the rhetoric I'm seeing from the opposing viewpoint is, oh, they're just going to start racial profiling.
[01:41:08.919 --> 01:41:12.802]  They're going to start, you know, busting down illegals left and right.
[01:41:13.302 --> 01:41:15.164]  But there has to have, they have to have a reason.
[01:41:15.544 --> 01:41:18.006]  Well, that's like the cockfight with a hundred people at it.
[01:41:18.907 --> 01:41:21.769]  Twenty-plus illegal aliens, Arpaio arrested them all.
[01:41:23.391 --> 01:41:24.131]  Well, look.
[01:41:25.493 --> 01:41:26.714]  But that's first contact.
[01:41:26.754 --> 01:41:27.834]  I mean, that's first contact.
[01:41:28.115 --> 01:41:32.999]  They were there for illegal gambling, the killing of animals, and there was drug dealing going on.
[01:41:33.971 --> 01:41:35.880]  Well, then they should be able to check the status.
[01:41:36.402 --> 01:41:37.849]  Look, my family came here...
[01:41:39.053 --> 01:41:42.596]  A couple generations ago, they checked in at Ellis Island, they did it the right way.
[01:41:43.317 --> 01:41:47.521]  You know, come on, let's have some respect for the border, let's have some respect for the American culture.
[01:41:47.541 --> 01:41:55.608]  I mean, see, I'm seeing kids' stories about kids being kicked out of schools because they're wearing American flag t-shirts, because it's inflammatory.
[01:41:55.628 --> 01:42:02.515]  I mean, Alex, this country is in a rapid descent, and if we don't do something now, we are going to lose it.
[01:42:02.855 --> 01:42:04.757]  We are going to lose the country we're fighting for.
[01:42:05.672 --> 01:42:09.354]  I heartily agree with you, and it's all covered in Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:42:11.055 --> 01:42:23.083]  You've got an organization of hundreds of thousands of people that are involved, in the top five or six in the country, with true activists that are really carrying the torch outside the left-right paradigm of constitutional liberty.
[01:42:23.723 --> 01:42:25.984]  I'm seeing exponential awakening.
[01:42:26.705 --> 01:42:27.305]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:42:27.345 --> 01:42:33.049]  Where you're at, give us a report on the type of awakening you're seeing and the mood of the nation.
[01:42:33.689 --> 01:42:42.736]  Well, in all the statistics that I've seen through our show on The Reality Report, through our website membership, it's a constant upward trend.
[01:42:43.597 --> 01:42:51.083]  And that's directly related to the constitutional abuses the American people are experiencing.
[01:42:52.564 --> 01:43:02.412]  We're having up to a thousand people a month joining our website because they're seeking solutions, they're seeking answers, and they're finding it with the other members that restoretherepublic.net.
[01:43:04.710 --> 01:43:07.913]  Well, you know, I told the story yesterday, but I'll briefly recap it.
[01:43:08.033 --> 01:43:28.690]  I took my son to a campout birthday party in Wimberley, and it was doctors, lawyers, professionals, you know, this was an elite area of Wimberley, but they're involved in the whole community, and everyone I was talking to, most of them didn't even know who I was, and I liked that, because they didn't know who Alex Jones was, some of them did,
[01:43:30.932 --> 01:43:31.633]  I don't
[01:43:50.646 --> 01:44:00.077]  They were so informed, and I asked them, I said, what percentage, and some of them were administrators and things, what percentage of this town is awake?
[01:44:00.117 --> 01:44:04.262]  And they'd say, half or more are fully awake, and we're waking up the other half.
[01:44:04.683 --> 01:44:05.804]  I mean, this is exciting.
[01:44:06.525 --> 01:44:13.647]  Well you know what Alex, I'm glad you brought that up because I do have an excellent report for you and your listeners are going to be the first to hear it.
[01:44:14.568 --> 01:44:19.769]  Our magazine, Republic Magazine, just got picked up for national distribution by books a million.
[01:44:20.209 --> 01:44:23.390]  And just about a month or so ago we got picked up by Barnes & Noble.
[01:44:23.850 --> 01:44:31.693]  So our message is going to be on every single newsstand at those national magazine distribution companies all across the country.
[01:44:32.711 --> 01:44:35.193]  And they're picking it up because they know this message is selling.
[01:44:35.493 --> 01:44:38.576]  People won't buy Time Magazine anymore, but they'll get Restore the Republic.
[01:44:39.136 --> 01:44:48.884]  Yes, and because the truth will prevail, Alex, because the message is pure, the message is right, and the people are gravitating to... they can see through the garbage.
[01:44:49.444 --> 01:44:49.664]  Okay?
[01:44:49.985 --> 01:44:54.588]  Half the people I speak to do not trust the mainstream media anymore.
[01:44:54.808 --> 01:45:01.314]  That's why they're seeking out people like yourself, people like Republic Magazine, they watch my show, because they're looking for answers.
[01:45:02.439 --> 01:45:05.441]  And they're seeing through the mess, Alex.
[01:45:06.342 --> 01:45:07.002]  Well, they are.
[01:45:07.062 --> 01:45:09.144]  And again, folks, don't tread on me.
[01:45:09.424 --> 01:45:10.885]  Rise of the Republic.
[01:45:11.866 --> 01:45:22.393]  It's a civics class that doesn't put you to sleep, that is dynamic with some of the most influential and important minds in the real Tea Party, the real patriot movement, not the fake
[01:45:22.813 --> 01:45:23.593]  Patriot Movement.
[01:45:23.633 --> 01:45:25.034]  This film needs to be seen everywhere.
[01:45:25.054 --> 01:45:31.956]  I'm so glad that you and William Lewis have decided to encourage people to make copies of it and to get it out to everyone they know.
[01:45:32.337 --> 01:45:38.499]  Gary Franchi and William Lewis present Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, R.J.
[01:45:38.559 --> 01:45:45.441]  Harris, Michael Benerik, Tom DeWeese, Alex Jones, Eben Vieira, Richard Mack, Cynthia Davis, Charles Key, and many, many others.
[01:45:45.481 --> 01:45:46.762]  Again, InfoWars.com.
[01:45:47.082 --> 01:45:47.943]  Hi, I just have a quick question.
[01:45:47.963 --> 01:45:56.008]  My parents are part of a credit union and they swear that their money is safe in the credit union and I don't know if it is safe in the credit union or just because it's not a bank it's not safe and I don't know.
[01:45:56.028 --> 01:45:57.969]  I wanted to know what you thought about that.
[01:46:17.825 --> 01:46:21.087]  I think hedging your bets if your money is in banks.
[01:46:21.307 --> 01:46:22.388]  Local is the way to go.
[01:46:22.488 --> 01:46:23.709]  Credit unions are the way to go.
[01:46:23.789 --> 01:46:27.872]  Go look at their state rating, not just their Barron's or Forbes rating.
[01:46:28.772 --> 01:46:29.553]  Put the name of the bank.
[01:46:29.993 --> 01:46:34.576]  I mean, just Google the term, or search engine the term, or startpage.com the term, whatever you want.
[01:46:35.977 --> 01:46:37.538]  Bank ratings in your state.
[01:46:37.978 --> 01:46:45.901]  And then look at the ratings of local banks and then split your money into the number one and number two banks if you need money and capital in the banking system.
[01:46:46.221 --> 01:46:51.183]  What we're going into is so dangerous that I don't even know if it's safe for people to have money in the bank.
[01:46:51.263 --> 01:47:03.888]  But if you've got a business like mine, an operation, where you've got to pay for things and pay employees, you know, I mean, if you've got an operation with 15, 20, 30 people, you've got to have a bunch of money in the bank just to pay payroll and taxes and run the operation.
[01:47:04.328 --> 01:47:05.488]  But I appreciate your call, Kevin.
[01:47:05.508 --> 01:47:07.009]  Let's get a take on that from Gary Franchi.
[01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:16.594]  Well, I think precious metals is absolutely crucial at this time, because at the end of the day, when everything goes down, paper is worthless.
[01:47:17.294 --> 01:47:21.736]  You'll be able to start a fire with it, maybe, if your water doesn't put it out right.
[01:47:25.037 --> 01:47:26.298]  Hello Alex, good to be on your show.
[01:47:26.318 --> 01:47:27.558]  I wanted to let you know that
[01:47:53.210 --> 01:47:55.431]  I wanted to ask you a question after I leave this comment real quick.
[01:47:56.071 --> 01:48:04.153]  Um, let's see, on Discovery Channel on June 8, 2003, there was a show, you know, the American Chopper?
[01:48:05.553 --> 01:48:06.633]  Motorcycles, yeah.
[01:48:07.773 --> 01:48:07.934]  Yes.
[01:48:09.034 --> 01:48:15.435]  Well, what happened is, on Jesse Ventura's show, they were trying to find a piece on 9-11 Truth.
[01:48:16.215 --> 01:48:19.496]  I mean, on the World Trade Center, a piece of the World Trade Center.
[01:48:20.016 --> 01:48:22.377]  Well, welded to the bike.
[01:48:23.425 --> 01:48:27.986]  It's called a fire bike on a... I'm a little flustered, it's my first time call.
[01:48:28.287 --> 01:48:30.367]  Yeah, you're talking about the wreckage of the steel, go ahead.
[01:48:31.027 --> 01:48:43.651]  Yes, they got a piece of, uh, they got a boat welded onto the, uh, gas tank of the bike, and they have it, um, I have a video name on YouTube.
[01:48:43.671 --> 01:48:52.194]  Yeah, well there was lots of other wreckage given to community centers and parks around the country, not just the wreckage that they're hiding in that, uh, in that hangar that Ventura discovered.
[01:48:53.799 --> 01:48:55.560]  Well, can I go and ask my question real quick?
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:56.661]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:48:56.681 --> 01:49:11.313]  Real quick, on Betflix, I've been waiting for shadow government and pre-state, and of course I'm going to probably be waiting for Recover the Republic or Restore the Republic.
[01:49:11.573 --> 01:49:12.114]  When do you think
[01:49:13.364 --> 01:49:20.172]  Now what happened is they put them up for sale two weeks ago, and then if they don't get sales, they just order the limited amount and ship it.
[01:49:20.212 --> 01:49:23.456]  It was accepted, all our films were basically accepted to Netflix.
[01:49:23.476 --> 01:49:25.818]  We just shipped them out last week, so you should be getting them soon.
[01:49:26.139 --> 01:49:27.100]  I appreciate your call.
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:28.481]  We've never gone with Netflix before.
[01:49:29.202 --> 01:49:35.243]  And so what they do is they post it and then you know they see if there's a response and if they basically get one order then they order that from you.
[01:49:35.663 --> 01:49:38.144]  And so they've ordered it and they've got it and it should be shipping out to you.
[01:49:38.184 --> 01:49:40.925]  Netflix has one of the highest ratings out there for customer service.
[01:49:41.725 --> 01:49:43.625]  So we're selling videos to them.
[01:49:43.905 --> 01:49:47.086]  But I think there's that start off process where there's a few week lag time.
[01:49:47.586 --> 01:49:48.766]  But I appreciate your call.
[01:49:49.627 --> 01:49:53.207]  So that's key information there for those that want to get those films in their hand.
[01:49:53.447 --> 01:49:54.068]  Quick question.
[01:49:54.128 --> 01:49:54.868]  Mike in Arizona.
[01:49:54.888 --> 01:49:55.328]  You're on the air.
[01:49:56.326 --> 01:49:58.948]  Yes, I have a way to stop the New World Order.
[01:49:59.989 --> 01:50:06.114]  I think by putting a bullet in my sniper gun and killing David Rockefeller.
[01:50:06.474 --> 01:50:07.695]  No, no, no.
[01:50:07.855 --> 01:50:08.636]  I'm going to let you go.
[01:50:08.656 --> 01:50:13.179]  A provocateur phone call, if I ever heard one.
[01:50:13.199 --> 01:50:15.701]  In fact, did you guys have time to delay that out?
[01:50:18.723 --> 01:50:19.864]  Oh, okay, the network got it.
[01:50:19.944 --> 01:50:20.405]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:20.485 --> 01:50:21.886]  Look, we're not calling for violence here.
[01:50:22.166 --> 01:50:24.568]  Gary, going out to break, we're winning peacefully.
[01:50:24.608 --> 01:50:25.489]  Why do we want violence?
[01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:30.701]  Well, violence is only going to bring about what they want.
[01:50:30.821 --> 01:50:35.982]  They want to round us up, they want to shut us down, and they want total police state lockdown.
[01:50:36.082 --> 01:50:38.703]  And that violence is what will accomplish that goal.
[01:50:39.683 --> 01:50:42.124]  Plus, it's not one globalist that runs the New World Order.
[01:50:42.164 --> 01:50:43.504]  It's a criminal system.
[01:50:43.584 --> 01:50:45.545]  We want David Rockefeller to have a trial.
[01:50:46.085 --> 01:50:48.265]  We want him to have all the rights that citizens have.
[01:50:48.305 --> 01:50:51.446]  Because if one person doesn't have rights, none of us have rights, okay?
[01:50:51.726 --> 01:50:54.927]  We'll be back with a few final calls with Gary Franchi, the new film, Don't Tread on Me.
[01:50:57.364 --> 01:51:05.452]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.
[01:51:05.472 --> 01:51:05.993]  800-477-9256.
[01:51:06.954 --> 01:51:13.040]  Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer, and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:17.341]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[01:51:46.112 --> 01:51:47.812]  Or call now for free information.
[01:51:47.832 --> 01:51:47.952]  800-477-9256.
[01:51:48.072 --> 01:51:48.372]  That's 800-477-9256.
[01:51:48.432 --> 01:51:50.053]  They helped to create a new world order.
[01:51:50.073 --> 01:51:51.213]  We are part of a new world order.
[01:51:51.233 --> 01:51:52.814]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[01:52:02.257 --> 01:52:07.040]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:11.582]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:52:11.902 --> 01:52:14.224]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:52:14.244 --> 01:52:16.765]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:52:16.785 --> 01:52:19.687]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:52:20.047 --> 01:52:27.611]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:52:27.964 --> 01:52:33.228]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:52:33.368 --> 01:52:36.169]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:52:36.209 --> 01:52:39.652]  So it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:52:39.892 --> 01:52:40.812]  And I got news for you.
[01:52:40.973 --> 01:52:42.273]  You're everyone else.
[01:52:42.313 --> 01:52:43.314]  Invisible Empire.

[01:52:54.272 --> 01:52:56.895]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:52:57.295 --> 01:53:02.260]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:04.362]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:53:04.682 --> 01:53:08.626]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only
[01:53:10.837 --> 01:53:11.117]  We're good
[01:53:29.991 --> 01:53:30.311]  We're good.
[01:54:05.379 --> 01:54:05.827]  Yeah.
[01:54:10.882 --> 01:54:12.963]  Think what's happened with the Obama deception.
[01:54:12.983 --> 01:54:15.565]  Of course, there's now attempts out there to censor it.
[01:54:15.605 --> 01:54:16.186]  It's really bad.
[01:54:17.707 --> 01:54:22.530]  Think what's happened with Fall of the Republic, what's happened with Loose Change, what's happened with Endgame, Terror Storm.
[01:54:23.191 --> 01:54:28.054]  We now need that to happen with Don't Tread on Me, with screenings around the country, people making copies.
[01:54:28.534 --> 01:54:33.418]  Again, but support the filmmakers, get it at Infowars.com, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:54:33.458 --> 01:54:37.020]  Gary Franchi, you're having simultaneous national screenings come up.
[01:54:37.321 --> 01:54:38.862]  Tell folks how they can get involved in this.
[01:54:39.738 --> 01:54:44.921]  Well, we're going to be putting up a page on our website so people can have the authorization printout form.
[01:54:45.722 --> 01:54:49.244]  And we want people to have screenings on June 26th of this year.
[01:54:49.284 --> 01:54:50.225]  That's a Saturday.
[01:54:50.945 --> 01:54:57.230]  And either in your home, at your public library, rent out the local cinema, do whatever you take.
[01:54:57.250 --> 01:55:03.074]  You know, print out movie posters, print out flyers, put ads out in the local newspapers.
[01:55:04.014 --> 01:55:12.360]  And do a huge national one-day push for a national screening all across this country, Saturday, June 26.
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:17.303]  That is D-Day for Don't Tread on Me, the movie, Rise of the Republic, Alex.
[01:55:17.723 --> 01:55:18.824]  Very exciting.
[01:55:18.844 --> 01:55:20.045]  We commend your work.
[01:55:20.105 --> 01:55:25.509]  It's so good to know there's other people out there crashing through the lives of disinformation like yourself.
[01:55:25.569 --> 01:55:28.231]  I'm not walking point alone with you out there and William Lewis.
[01:55:28.891 --> 01:55:31.593]  Let's go ahead and talk to Corey in BC.
[01:55:31.933 --> 01:55:32.874]  You're on the air, Corey.
[01:55:33.757 --> 01:55:36.679]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to say one quick statement here.
[01:55:36.699 --> 01:55:44.566]  I agree with most of what you say, but I disagree with one major facet that you keep telling people, and that is this unconstitutional Bill of Rights position.
[01:55:45.066 --> 01:55:47.708]  You have to look at this from a legal perspective.
[01:55:48.189 --> 01:55:56.035]  Most Americans, and Canadians for that matter, are beneficiaries to state beneficiary, federal beneficiary programs.
[01:55:57.043 --> 01:55:59.865]  I can't hire you, Alex, and say, come cut my grass.
[01:56:00.145 --> 01:56:05.247]  I'm going to pay you for that and for you to make a constitutional challenge or a Bill of Rights challenge that you're a slave.
[01:56:05.768 --> 01:56:13.792]  Most people are receiving benefits and they cannot make an argument subsequently after that they don't want to have to pay what to do when they're under contract.
[01:56:14.452 --> 01:56:16.253]  Likewise... I don't understand what you're listening to.
[01:56:16.273 --> 01:56:17.334]  You better simplify it.
[01:56:17.354 --> 01:56:18.294]  What are you talking about?
[01:56:19.094 --> 01:56:21.936]  You say the health care system is unconstitutional.
[01:56:22.611 --> 01:56:27.057]  That's a beneficiary program for people who are pursuing profit in commerce as taxpayers.
[01:56:27.197 --> 01:56:29.840]  No, no, the Commerce Clause, that's what's covered in this film.
[01:56:30.341 --> 01:56:34.586]  The federal government in 235 years has never been involved in healthcare.
[01:56:34.987 --> 01:56:35.347]  Okay?
[01:56:35.627 --> 01:56:38.251]  It's unconstitutional, up one side and down the other.
[01:56:38.511 --> 01:56:40.454]  It was written by the insurance companies, man.
[01:56:41.308 --> 01:56:44.570]  No, I understand they haven't been done, but they're doing it through the Commerce Clause.
[01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:46.851]  It was the Commerce Committee... Hey, hey, let me stop you!
[01:56:46.871 --> 01:57:00.718]  The Commerce Clause of the federal government was in Texas News last week, had a girl kicked out of school for a week, a third grader, seven years old, for a jolly rancher in her lunch pail, and the federal government told the state of Texas, no candy,
[01:57:01.158 --> 01:57:02.838]  Kids can't have one piece of candy.
[01:57:03.058 --> 01:57:07.620]  The federal government under the Commerce Clause has no business what guns I own.
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:09.740]  It has no business what I do with my property.
[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:13.201]  It has no business if my daughter has a stinkin' jolly rancher.
[01:57:13.441 --> 01:57:15.061]  My, man, just, oh.
[01:57:15.341 --> 01:57:16.021]  I'm gonna let you go.
[01:57:16.042 --> 01:57:17.462]  You can call back later for a bigger debate.
[01:57:17.482 --> 01:57:18.202]  We're almost out of time.
[01:57:18.422 --> 01:57:19.802]  Gary Franchi comments on that.
[01:57:19.822 --> 01:57:22.003]  I mean, the guy's not even an American.
[01:57:22.763 --> 01:57:29.788]  The Commerce Clause is what the federal government uses as their excuse to reign in the states whenever they feel like it.
[01:57:30.048 --> 01:57:32.129]  We cover that exclusively in this film.
[01:57:32.830 --> 01:57:33.450]  Exclusively.
[01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:37.112]  In fact, that's how the back cover starts out, getting into the Commerce Clause.
[01:57:37.172 --> 01:57:47.699]  I mean, look, if they can tell kids they can't have a Jolly Rancher, or through the Commerce Clause, or the McDonald's can't give people Happy Meal toys... That's not what the founders intended, Alex.
[01:57:47.859 --> 01:57:49.180]  That's not what the founders intended.
[01:57:50.029 --> 01:57:54.152]  You know, they just didn't want terrorists to trade between the states.
[01:57:54.872 --> 01:57:56.534]  You know, that's what they... They didn't want that!

[01:58:03.298 --> 01:58:06.801]  Oh no, the state of Texas was told by the Commerce Department, no Jolly Ranchers.
[01:58:07.001 --> 01:58:08.002]  That was mainstream news.
