[00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.691]  On that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:00:06.753 --> 00:00:12.336]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.192]  All right, we are now eight minutes into our number three.
[00:00:36.212 --> 00:01:00.725]  We've got Paul Watson joining us via video Skype connection, audio for radio listeners, visually for PrisonPlanet.tv members in the first 30 minutes of the next hour, then Charlie Skelton who writes for the Evening Standard, and the London Guardian reporter in Spain for Bilderberg 2010, giving us a first report on the closing of the resort and hotel today, and the top globalist arriving.
[00:01:01.525 --> 00:01:08.410]  Before we go any further, the film Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, is our newest documentary that we have produced.
[00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.394]  Jason Mermis is the director, and for the first time ever, the secret agenda of the planet's ruthless superclass is exposed.
[00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:23.340]  In stark detail, this documentary film chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.984]  Learn how this global oligarchy controls the populace through drug trafficking, money laundering, staged terror attacks, media propaganda and debt.
[00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:36.288]  The criminal controllers have successfully dominated the globe and are now in their final phase of consolidating power.
[00:01:36.748 --> 00:01:43.072]  Government narcotics trafficking, white slavery rings, the pervert guilds, how they control people in Congress.
[00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:46.361]  How different globalist organizations tie together.
[00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:49.062]  Two hours, 24 minutes, with extensive extras.
[00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:56.344]  It's got, of course, G. Edward Griffin, it's got Peter Dale Scott, and many, many others in the film, and I consulted on it.
[00:01:56.764 --> 00:02:03.825]  Very important documentary, and your purchase of the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the material, you are what makes this show possible.
[00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:10.747]  So, not only is this a great tool to wake up your friends and family, and also to inform you to a higher level, it also funds our operation.
[00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:18.053]  Of course, for people that want to understand the banking collapse that's happening, how the globalists are doing it, how they're behind it, fall of the republic.
[00:02:19.194 --> 00:02:28.401]  For folks that want to know how to take the states back, and the difference between a democracy and a republic, and the move to have sheriffs elected that'll say no to the feds, this should be given to every sheriff you know.
[00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:29.962]  The DVD is available.
[00:02:30.896 --> 00:02:32.156]  at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:32.897 --> 00:02:33.737]  Don't tread on me.
[00:02:33.857 --> 00:02:34.837]  Rise of the Republican.
[00:02:34.857 --> 00:02:35.578]  Of course I'm in it.
[00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:40.939]  Back in print after 20 years being out of print, The Secret Team by L. Fletcher Prouty.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.121]  How the top banks ran the Communist and the U.S.
[00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:46.822]  He was the head of Black Ops for the Pentagon.
[00:02:47.142 --> 00:02:48.342]  CIA liaison.
[00:02:48.842 --> 00:02:50.843]  This is the book the CIA doesn't want you to read.
[00:02:51.183 --> 00:02:53.024]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:53.124 --> 00:02:59.406]  You want to understand the police state control grid and have all the intel on what's being set up in the United States.
[00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:04.969]  The latest film that I directed with Rob Dew and Jason Douglas, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:05.950]  It covers it all.
[00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:14.035]  Again, available at Infowars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:18.578]  I want to thank everyone that has been supporting us buying the books and videos.
[00:03:18.838 --> 00:03:21.980]  More importantly though, if you own the books and videos, give them to people.
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.181]  Make copies of my films.
[00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:24.001]  Get them out.
[00:03:24.081 --> 00:03:25.022]  Air them on AXS TV.
[00:03:25.062 --> 00:03:25.882]  Show them to your church.
[00:03:26.343 --> 00:03:28.224]  People are ready to be awakened right now.
[00:03:28.664 --> 00:03:31.087]  And I also want to thank folks that have supported us in other ways.
[00:03:31.448 --> 00:03:45.767]  Spreading the word about the radio show on your local AM and FM, or satellite, or shortwave, or the web, or the free iPhone app on InfoWars.com, or donating, or supporting our sponsors, both national and local.
[00:03:46.207 --> 00:03:54.333]  Thank you for making this show one of the fastest growing radio programs in the world and the number one alternative radio show on the planet.
[00:03:54.613 --> 00:04:10.904]  We have the number one and number two, respectively, biggest alternative news websites according to Alexa.com and other major statistical algorithms out there on the web, Google Analytics, and we are doubling our web presence every year.
[00:04:11.644 --> 00:04:12.805]  So very, very exciting.
[00:04:12.845 --> 00:04:13.946]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:04:14.226 --> 00:04:15.507]  Okay, without further ado,
[00:04:16.647 --> 00:04:21.210]  I just want to point out, you made it possible, folks, and I commend you, and we're trying to go to the next level.
[00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.791]  And we can do it with your support.
[00:04:23.671 --> 00:04:27.013]  Dr. John Coleman, Coleman300.com is the website.
[00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:32.797]  His 35 years of investigative study of 37,000 pages of the Annals of Congress, the Congressional
[00:04:33.497 --> 00:04:42.905]  Uh, Globe and the, uh, Congressional Records has given Dr. Coleman a unique in-depth understanding of the layer upon layer of complexities which go to make up the United States Constitution.
[00:04:43.305 --> 00:04:47.228]  Very few of any constitutional scholars can claim such a unique, uh, distinction.
[00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.690]  And he also is the big researcher on the Committee of 300.
[00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:59.895]  A political science economist, Dr. Coleman, on location, hands-on experience in the field of different countries, makes him a writer, scholar, and lecturer of distinction.
[00:05:00.355 --> 00:05:07.538]  The Committee of 300, The Vanishing Middle Class, Apocalypse Waiting to Happen, Obama's America, Beyond the Conspiracy, and many more.
[00:05:07.858 --> 00:05:14.761]  Check out his books and more at Coleman 300 and his other materials at Coleman300.com.
[00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:18.283]  Dr. Coleman, great to have you with us today, sir.
[00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:19.551]  Thank you so much.
[00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:24.633]  All right, in the 46 minutes we've got left now, time is flying, you've got the floor.
[00:05:24.773 --> 00:05:29.394]  What is the Committee of 300, what is the world government, and where is it taking us?
[00:05:30.494 --> 00:05:32.555]  The Committee of 300 is the world government.
[00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:38.557]  It's one of your previous programs, there was a gentleman asking about the New World Order.
[00:05:38.597 --> 00:05:39.257]  How is it run?
[00:05:39.277 --> 00:05:40.497]  Well, it's run through the Committee of 300.
[00:05:40.577 --> 00:05:46.879]  They're also known as the Olympians in the early days, and men spoke about them under their breath, for fear of them.
[00:05:47.645 --> 00:05:57.747]  This is a massive organization which in the beginning was run by, mainly by the royalty in Europe, but now of course it's spread all over the world.
[00:05:58.167 --> 00:06:07.468]  The American Eastern Liberal Establishment was allowed in to join it and several of the other countries came in as lower echelon members.
[00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:14.810]  And this committee was the group that was begun actually by the drug trade with China.
[00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.010]  That's where they've amassed their fortunes.
[00:06:17.805 --> 00:06:19.465]  And that's where they got their beginning.
[00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:25.927]  But of course, they've gone from that to every level of society, every facet of our civilization.
[00:06:26.707 --> 00:06:35.849]  And they have people who have introduced population control and a wide variety of devices to keep control of everything that's happening.
[00:06:36.609 --> 00:06:44.811]  Now you can say that this is like a huge corporation where you have the CEO at the head, you have
[00:06:45.868 --> 00:06:47.309]  We're good to go.
[00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:16.150]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:47.673]  And by the way, you're a political scientist and economist, and I've read your work for more than 15 years, so I vouch for what you're saying, but perhaps you should give people a few dates, because you went and got source documents from the Office of Naval Intelligence, from retired admirals, from retired commander of the Office of Naval Intelligence.
[00:07:48.564 --> 00:08:09.596]  from government documents, and explain when it got its name, Committee of 300, and how it nexuses in with the Bilderberg Group, with the Roundtable, Royal Institute of International Affairs in England, with the CFR in the United States, how these other globalist groups tie in to the Committee of 300.
[00:08:10.516 --> 00:08:18.639]  Well, these organizations that you mentioned, like the Burgers and the Council on Foreign Relations, these are mere cogs in the big machinery.
[00:08:19.059 --> 00:08:21.900]  They're not the preeminent bodies that we have to deal with.
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:36.225]  They are cogs in this giant organization called the Committee of 300, and they took this name from a family of 300 very powerful merchants living in England, and it began with a charter
[00:08:37.048 --> 00:08:42.490]  From the Queen to give them the right to go and invade countries and make war against them.
[00:08:43.331 --> 00:08:45.952]  And it all, of course, was based on the Chinese Okium Trade.
[00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:51.715]  They had a huge treasury of money gained from the Chinese Okium Trade.
[00:08:51.735 --> 00:08:56.497]  They even got a charter from the British government to go to war against China.
[00:08:56.757 --> 00:08:58.978]  That gives you some idea of the power of these people.
[00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:03.475]  It's like a private organization that really is the government of the world.
[00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:18.405]  And of course even MSNBC admits that in 1832, this same committee of opium merchants, British, Dutch, East India that had merged hundreds of years before, set up just skull and bones to take over the elite of the United States.
[00:09:18.465 --> 00:09:24.049]  So this is really the oldest continually operating private intelligence operation.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:30.283]  Absolutely, and they co-opted the best available brains in the world at that time.
[00:09:30.844 --> 00:09:40.729]  And all the old Eastern Liberalist establishment families, like John Andeside Perkins and so on, they were all co-opted into this committee.
[00:09:41.469 --> 00:09:48.153]  And today the CFR takes its orders from the Royal Institute of International Affairs in Chatham House in London.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.820]  That's a daily affair.
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.541]  The orders are relayed through one of the brokerage houses.
[00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:56.182]  I don't want to name them in case they file suit against me.
[00:09:56.542 --> 00:10:00.563]  But they are the ones who convey the message to the Secretary of State.
[00:10:01.243 --> 00:10:04.984]  And then it becomes government policy.
[00:10:05.564 --> 00:10:07.484]  And foreign policy, monetary policy.
[00:10:07.945 --> 00:10:14.186]  In fact, very little that is enacted is not originally from the Royal Institute of International Affairs.
[00:10:15.037 --> 00:10:20.380]  Which is the foreign, which is the international arm of the Committee of 300.
[00:10:22.582 --> 00:10:30.106]  It's amazing, and of course they use the drug war as a way to break up China, and they're doing the same thing today here.
[00:10:30.907 --> 00:10:38.871]  They make the drugs illegal and then take over all the criminal networks and mass all the secret wealth through the drug war.
[00:10:39.492 --> 00:10:41.253]  Exactly, that's as I said, that's how they
[00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:44.024]  And he's just one of their agents here in the U.S., correct?
[00:10:44.064 --> 00:10:44.824]  That's correct.
[00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:45.044]  Oh, yes.
[00:10:45.064 --> 00:10:49.808]  And of course, I also believe that there are a few others in the U.S.
[00:10:49.828 --> 00:10:50.569]  who are agents as well.
[00:11:11.716 --> 00:11:13.417]  Al Brzezinski played a big role.
[00:11:13.977 --> 00:11:19.880]  He was one of their Foreign Arms Specialists, and he wrote many of the policies for the U.S.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.720]  that were carried out.
[00:11:22.301 --> 00:11:25.982]  And especially weak, I think, in this regard, was the Carter administration.
[00:11:26.903 --> 00:11:32.505]  They were like just servants to this committee, and James Earl Carter did exactly what he was told.
[00:11:32.745 --> 00:11:34.066]  He never deviated from that.
[00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:40.016]  Well, we've only got 40 minutes left, and it's clear I'm going to have to get you back up for two hours in the near future.
[00:11:40.096 --> 00:11:41.357]  Coleman300.com.
[00:11:41.757 --> 00:11:43.659]  A short segment coming up, then a long segment.
[00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:45.540]  I'm going to try to shut up when we get back.
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.261]  It's so intriguing.
[00:11:47.301 --> 00:11:57.109]  Go over your research of the Committee of 300, what their goals are, how they tie into these other groups that serve them, and where this is going in the future.
[00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:04.996]  With our guest, Dr. John Coleman, I'm Alex Jones, and of course we cover this group's eugenics aims in Endgame.
[00:12:05.865 --> 00:12:10.088]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:12:10.409 --> 00:12:11.029]  Number one.
[00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:14.472]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:12:14.752 --> 00:12:15.333]  Number two.
[00:12:15.613 --> 00:12:20.176]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:12:20.517 --> 00:12:20.957]  It's true.
[00:12:21.257 --> 00:12:25.801]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:12:26.101 --> 00:12:26.642]  Number 3.
[00:12:26.942 --> 00:12:30.225]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:12:30.525 --> 00:12:34.249]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:12:34.449 --> 00:12:34.990]  Number 4.
[00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.612]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:12:37.993 --> 00:12:41.356]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:46.378]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:12:46.598 --> 00:12:51.379]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:12:51.659 --> 00:12:55.681]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:13:10.194 --> 00:13:11.155]  Tyranny is here.
[00:13:11.455 --> 00:13:15.058]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:13:15.078 --> 00:13:17.600]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:23.064]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:13:23.484 --> 00:13:29.729]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:13:30.149 --> 00:13:35.691]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:13:36.091 --> 00:13:39.832]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:13:40.312 --> 00:13:44.313]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:13:44.593 --> 00:13:50.155]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:13:50.535 --> 00:13:53.556]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:13:54.096 --> 00:13:55.497]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:13:56.057 --> 00:13:56.497]  It's here.

[00:15:07.288 --> 00:15:08.288]  Allergies and asthma.
[00:15:08.628 --> 00:15:09.529]  Chronic disease.
[00:15:10.049 --> 00:15:11.450]  Is your home making you sick?
[00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:12.491]  Here's a fact.
[00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:14.652]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse.
[00:15:14.893 --> 00:15:20.496]  And the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.
[00:15:20.817 --> 00:15:27.641]  To rid your home of these contaminants, get the best-priced air purifiers in the industry at airfiltersandpurifiers.com.
[00:15:28.021 --> 00:15:30.743]  Our air purifiers are specialized to fit your needs.
[00:15:30.943 --> 00:15:34.186]  From allergy sufferers, to the sleep-deprived, to the chemically sensitive.
[00:15:34.926 --> 00:15:35.366]  I think so.
[00:16:08.806 --> 00:16:13.854]  Now let's remember that 30 years ago the mainstream media said the Bilderberg Group didn't exist.
[00:16:14.796 --> 00:16:18.662]  But Dr. John Coleman from Deep Research has found the documents about the Committee of 300.
[00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:23.186]  And he believes it's the overall control grid.
[00:16:23.226 --> 00:16:36.449]  Now the group he describes certainly exists and we know that's the power nexus through these letter of marks that were given by the British Crown to these families that then merged with the Dutch and others and of course took control of this nation.
[00:16:36.909 --> 00:16:38.589]  You've got the floor, sir.
[00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:41.110]  So what is the Bilderberg Group?
[00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.610]  Just one of the key meeting groups?
[00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.851]  The Bilderbergers was founded at a place called
[00:16:47.945 --> 00:16:55.269]  Bilderberg is in Holland, and that was under the control of the old Dutch prince.
[00:16:55.949 --> 00:17:00.011]  It was there that they had their first meeting, in the town of Bilderberg.
[00:17:01.192 --> 00:17:02.752]  Yeah, Oosterbeek, Holland.
[00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:05.514]  But my question is, how does it tie in?
[00:17:05.574 --> 00:17:13.978]  Because then when you research Bilderberg, you find out it was a group that had been meeting for hundreds of years, and just ties into the Dutch and German arm of this same committee.
[00:17:14.454 --> 00:17:21.659]  Yes, well what these people do, they take names that date back hundreds of years and then they go up those names for their societies today.
[00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:30.504]  And, you know, what you're looking at is a loosely knit group of people, as I said in my book, with commonly held goals.
[00:17:30.624 --> 00:17:35.368]  It's not the case that there's some just group meeting socially.
[00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:40.551]  In fact, the Committee of 300 has 150 year old history.
[00:17:41.488 --> 00:17:53.374]  And they have some of the most brilliant and intellectual assembled to form a complete, totalitarian, absolutely controlled new society, like the New World Order inside a one world government.
[00:17:53.754 --> 00:17:54.635]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[00:17:54.675 --> 00:17:59.417]  So when did you first discover the term Committee of 300 in the power structure, and what is their goal?
[00:18:01.158 --> 00:18:06.061]  Their goals are... They want to have an open... H.G.
[00:18:06.101 --> 00:18:10.403]  Wells, who was an earlier member of their elite coterie,
[00:18:11.297 --> 00:18:21.501]  He wrote a work called, The Open Conspiracy's Plan for a World Revolution, and it was a bold statement of intent, which nobody believed, of course.
[00:18:22.682 --> 00:18:40.249]  Wells accepted this, and he brought the conspiracy, and it says that, I'll quote you some of it, I can't do it all, The Open Conspiracy will appear first, I believe, as a conscious organization of intelligent, in some cases wealthy men, as a movement having
[00:18:40.771 --> 00:19:04.522]  Distinct social and political reigns, complicitly ignoring most of the existing apparatus of political control, or using it only as an incidental implement in the stages, a mere movement of a number of people in a certain direction, prepared to discover, with a sort of surprise, the common object to which they are all moving, and all sorts of ways they will be influencing and controlling the governance of the world.
[00:19:06.163 --> 00:19:09.245]  And, you know, George Orwell mentioned something about this in his book, 1984.
[00:19:11.127 --> 00:19:13.007]  So that's really what they plan to do.
[00:19:15.448 --> 00:19:16.848]  And I remember reading that H.G.
[00:19:16.908 --> 00:19:28.571]  Wells quote, because he wanted this global world government, and talked about how they would exterminate most of the people, and of course he was one of their top thinkers, but that particular quote you just gave, where does that come from again?
[00:19:28.591 --> 00:19:32.692]  That comes from his paper, I'll read it to you.
[00:19:33.332 --> 00:19:37.253]  The Open Conspiracy Plans for a World Revolution.
[00:19:37.953 --> 00:19:38.693]  That's what it's called.
[00:19:39.557 --> 00:19:44.722]  Yeah, plans for a world revolution.
[00:19:44.742 --> 00:19:46.944]  We've got to do another paper on that.
[00:19:47.164 --> 00:19:53.910]  I found this document in the British Museum in London, which is one of the greatest repositories of information in the world.
[00:19:54.711 --> 00:19:59.195]  I was privileged, of course, having special access to certain areas that are closed to the public.
[00:19:59.916 --> 00:20:04.260]  But that's where I found most of this work that I've written about.
[00:20:06.189 --> 00:20:09.351]  Well, he was quite open about a lot of it in books like The New World Order.
[00:20:09.872 --> 00:20:11.113]  Oh yes, he was.
[00:20:11.873 --> 00:20:15.776]  But I mean, what I'm talking about is the formation of it in the beginning was kept very secret.
[00:20:18.659 --> 00:20:21.080]  And of course, Cecil Rhodes tied into this, didn't he?
[00:20:21.661 --> 00:20:26.705]  Oh yes, he was financed by the Lord Alfred Milner.
[00:20:26.885 --> 00:20:32.930]  Lord Alfred Milner was an autocrat who'd made huge fortunes in Russia.
[00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.952]  And he sent Rhodes out, actually,
[00:20:36.658 --> 00:20:36.898]  Yes.
[00:20:55.814 --> 00:21:02.499]  Small beginning and they still have this all centred in the City of London which is a private preserve, financial preserve of the Committee of 300.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.463]  The City of London is totally different from London itself.
[00:21:07.563 --> 00:21:18.532]  It's a financial centre and Rhodes was of course set up with unlimited money and he bought up most of the claims of the small miners and when the opportunities came
[00:21:19.218 --> 00:21:24.562]  To start mining on a big scale, they were there and waiting and had all of the appropriate wealth to back it up.
[00:21:24.622 --> 00:21:28.645]  And today, of course, the mines in South Africa are the biggest in the world.
[00:21:29.125 --> 00:21:32.748]  They have a gold seam that stretches for 200 miles east to west.
[00:21:33.509 --> 00:21:35.350]  And it's not just some small couple of nuggets.
[00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.871]  It's driving down those mines.
[00:21:36.911 --> 00:21:40.554]  You go down 6,000 feet in a cage that drops like a stone.
[00:21:41.417 --> 00:21:43.839]  And if you don't have a strong stomach, don't try it.
[00:21:44.579 --> 00:21:52.944]  And you get down to these places where they're working, the places, and they've got enormous credit for hiring.
[00:21:53.025 --> 00:21:54.145]  Stay there, stay there, doctor.
[00:21:54.165 --> 00:21:55.366]  We're gonna come right back to you.
[00:21:55.986 --> 00:21:56.907]  We're on the march.
[00:21:57.387 --> 00:21:58.988]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:59.929 --> 00:22:02.611]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:05.342 --> 00:22:10.205]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:22:10.305 --> 00:22:11.066]  What have we got?
[00:22:11.306 --> 00:22:13.427]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:22:13.747 --> 00:22:14.468]  A republic.
[00:22:14.748 --> 00:22:17.329]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.311]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:21.572]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:22:21.692 --> 00:22:22.973]  So they think they own our land?
[00:22:23.373 --> 00:22:24.494]  They think they own our water?
[00:22:24.694 --> 00:22:25.094]  Children?
[00:22:25.294 --> 00:22:26.095]  Our education?
[00:22:26.415 --> 00:22:27.015]  Our money?
[00:22:27.256 --> 00:22:30.898]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:22:31.258 --> 00:22:35.902]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:22:36.242 --> 00:22:37.063]  We have the facts.
[00:22:37.263 --> 00:22:38.384]  We have the Constitution.
[00:22:38.424 --> 00:22:39.304]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:22:39.324 --> 00:22:40.145]  We have common law.
[00:22:40.225 --> 00:22:42.467]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:42.727 --> 00:22:46.510]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:51.415]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:22:51.575 --> 00:22:52.957]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:22:53.077 --> 00:22:53.918]  Don't tread on me.
[00:22:54.158 --> 00:23:01.025]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:23:05.222 --> 00:23:09.184]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:23:09.404 --> 00:23:15.447]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:23:15.807 --> 00:23:22.910]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:27.772]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:23:28.072 --> 00:23:29.553]  Get a free, detailed catalog.
[00:23:29.693 --> 00:23:36.559]  By calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[00:23:36.739 --> 00:23:40.523]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:23:40.983 --> 00:23:47.209]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:23:47.729 --> 00:23:51.171]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:23:51.651 --> 00:23:57.915]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:23:58.015 --> 00:23:58.816]  Thank you!
[00:24:06.226 --> 00:24:14.332]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[00:24:14.712 --> 00:24:25.160]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[00:24:25.601 --> 00:24:31.025]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[00:24:31.585 --> 00:24:36.068]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[00:24:36.468 --> 00:24:45.194]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[00:24:45.534 --> 00:24:55.361]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[00:24:55.661 --> 00:24:58.823]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:24:59.344 --> 00:25:00.344]  Silverlungs.com.
[00:25:01.305 --> 00:25:01.425]  Yeah.
[00:25:25.563 --> 00:25:30.130]  Well I tell ya, ten years ago you never saw news headlines about the Bilderberg Group.
[00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:31.212]  Here's the Times of London.
[00:25:31.613 --> 00:25:34.096]  Secretive Bilderberg Club ready for protest.
[00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:42.289]  And it's a high-powered meeting of Committee of 300 members, but it's not as secretive as the overall Committee of 300.
[00:25:42.589 --> 00:25:51.671]  And I've researched this, and our guest is dead on and has the documents, and he has the book, which you could call the Bible of conspiracy theories, but it's not theories, it's fact.
[00:25:52.351 --> 00:25:53.731]  And of course, that's the Committee of 300.
[00:25:53.831 --> 00:26:03.313]  Coleman300.com is the website, and we cover their endgame eugenics agenda in, of course, my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:26:03.573 --> 00:26:04.713]  And folks, this isn't a joke.
[00:26:05.413 --> 00:26:18.205]  You know, they stalled you and said there's no secret groups, there's no world government, there's no derivatives, the bankers aren't engaged in fractional reserve banking, the government's not shipping in narcotics, everything's fine, go back to sleep.
[00:26:18.626 --> 00:26:21.128]  Now they admit all that's happening, but saying it's good.
[00:26:21.929 --> 00:26:24.432]  Fox TV says we're growing opium, it's good.
[00:26:25.633 --> 00:26:27.575]  Yes, world government's real, but it's good.
[00:26:29.076 --> 00:26:36.683]  Well, from my research, this ends with an authoritarian world government with one-child policy at the bare minimum.
[00:26:37.203 --> 00:26:45.571]  Now, you were finishing up, going down the diamond mines, and of course the De Beers Oppenheimer Global Diamond Monopoly set up by the Milner Group.
[00:26:45.891 --> 00:26:49.314]  I've read documents from Milner at the end of World War I in 1919.
[00:26:49.494 --> 00:26:50.075]  These are public.
[00:26:52.876 --> 00:26:57.899]  Saying, we've got to get some type of thug dictator in in Germany and set them up for the next war.
[00:26:57.919 --> 00:27:00.841]  I mean, that's the wide-reaching, long-term view.
[00:27:01.201 --> 00:27:10.848]  So they get Wall Street and the general public in a quarterly mindset, only thinking about the present and profits now, but they're all positioned for the long-term win.
[00:27:11.588 --> 00:27:17.852]  Okay, and we get so many intellectuals on here and researchers who say, oh no, the elite are short-sighted.
[00:27:18.133 --> 00:27:25.257]  But when you look at their long-term plans, their admitted Ford Foundation operations, Brzezinski's 25- and 50-year plans, no!
[00:27:26.999 --> 00:27:31.922]  Of course, the political science head at Georgetown, Carol Quigley, he says 30-year, 50-year plans.
[00:27:32.342 --> 00:27:33.323]  So no, it is
[00:27:33.643 --> 00:27:34.583]  We should be very concerned.
[00:27:34.603 --> 00:27:38.325]  If we want to keep our republic, and the United States is not a democracy, it's a republic.
[00:27:38.345 --> 00:27:39.586]  Let me make that clear.
[00:28:02.341 --> 00:28:07.824]  You cannot have a democracy in a confederated republic.
[00:28:07.884 --> 00:28:12.406]  Our principles may be democratic, but our actual form of government is republican.
[00:28:13.647 --> 00:28:15.087]  That should settle that question.
[00:28:15.808 --> 00:28:21.290]  And of course we ought to be concerned, because here you have an organization that's permeated every strata of our society.
[00:28:23.208 --> 00:28:23.728]  We're good to go.
[00:28:47.018 --> 00:28:49.480]  In 1972, they told me to go and hang myself.
[00:28:49.581 --> 00:28:51.322]  It did all kinds of nasty things to me.
[00:28:51.702 --> 00:28:57.888]  But if you look back at my record, you'll find that I've made over 500 predictions.
[00:28:57.948 --> 00:29:07.616]  I hate to use the word, but I said these things were going to happen in the future, and I think that most of them, we went through them just the other day, and most of them,
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.560]  I've come to pass.
[00:29:09.741 --> 00:29:12.082]  So I think I've got a fairly good record.
[00:29:27.651 --> 00:29:40.402]  And of course, would you agree with some of the other historians we've had on that this ties into England, Germany, the Dutch, but also the model that the British picked up out of some of the Italian families?
[00:29:41.203 --> 00:29:41.984]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:29:42.684 --> 00:29:49.811]  The Italian families, like the Bernatis, they were the model of this organization and most of these people.
[00:29:50.313 --> 00:30:02.601]  The old Florentine and Venetian black nobility, they were not black, their skins weren't black, but they were known as black nobility by the people of the cities because their deeds were so evil that they could not stand the light of day.
[00:30:03.522 --> 00:30:05.723]  And they didn't take too much trouble to hide them either.
[00:30:05.763 --> 00:30:07.705]  That's why they called them the black nobility.
[00:30:08.585 --> 00:30:11.827]  And you know, that's the dynasty that Queen Victoria of England sprang from.
[00:30:11.847 --> 00:30:18.472]  So I'll give you some idea just how big these organizations have grown.
[00:30:20.185 --> 00:30:29.532]  Yeah, I've seen a lot of people now that are out there that have basically taken your work on the Black Nobility and basically declare it as their own.
[00:30:29.592 --> 00:30:33.115]  But that's the greatest form of flattery, is imitation.
[00:30:33.916 --> 00:30:40.180]  I know that, and I think my work might well be in the United States anyway.
[00:30:40.441 --> 00:30:46.765]  This type of information, the most plagiarized of all books of the conspiracy theories.
[00:30:47.626 --> 00:30:49.888]  But that's alright, as long as we get the news out there.
[00:30:50.694 --> 00:30:51.454]  That's the main thing.
[00:30:51.654 --> 00:30:52.875]  Well, let's continue.
[00:30:52.895 --> 00:30:55.535]  You talk about an autocratic, oppressive world government.
[00:30:56.856 --> 00:31:00.217]  So from their documents, from the research, are they on schedule?
[00:31:00.917 --> 00:31:06.438]  Brzezinski two weeks ago told the CFR, for the first time the world is awake to their world government, that they're in trouble.
[00:31:06.959 --> 00:31:07.979]  A. Do you agree with that?
[00:31:08.539 --> 00:31:12.880]  And B. Flesh out from your research the type of world they want to build.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.581]  Well, they have been uncovered.
[00:31:16.621 --> 00:31:17.401]  That's the whole thing.
[00:31:17.722 --> 00:31:19.282]  That's not something they bargained for.
[00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:22.640]  They certainly didn't bargain for that at all.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.421]  It strives, as I said, for a one-world government.
[00:31:28.021 --> 00:31:30.161]  A new world order inside a one-world government.
[00:31:30.201 --> 00:31:31.102]  That's the ultimate.
[00:31:31.862 --> 00:31:40.004]  Where you have a few people at the very top, and you have the middle management, and then you have the lower management, and then you have what's called the masses.
[00:31:40.044 --> 00:31:40.484]  That's us.
[00:31:40.524 --> 00:31:41.044]  That's me.
[00:31:41.104 --> 00:31:41.504]  That's you.
[00:31:42.524 --> 00:31:49.046]  We are destined to be controlled, the population controlled, by various measures worldwide.
[00:31:49.648 --> 00:31:51.149]  Uh, disease and wars.
[00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:56.512]  But Bertrand Russell, a senior statesman, once said that wars seem to have been disappointing.
[00:31:56.753 --> 00:31:57.993]  They haven't killed enough people.
[00:31:58.714 --> 00:32:09.440]  So what he said, we need to reintroduce periodically plagues like the Black Plague, where millions of people get wiped out until we get to our optimum size population.
[00:32:10.141 --> 00:32:12.002]  These are the things that are very, very real.
[00:32:12.702 --> 00:32:15.144]  They're not the pigments of my imagination, believe me.
[00:32:17.233 --> 00:32:22.775]  No, I've read, I've actually got the Marshall and Russell books where he talks about that, and then he's hailed as a liberal!
[00:32:23.876 --> 00:32:33.320]  And he talks about the scientific dictatorship, where a revolt of the commoners will be as impossible as a revolt of sheep against the practice of eating mutton.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:39.222]  Exactly, that's exactly what, that's exactly what their intention was.
[00:32:39.842 --> 00:32:45.645]  And you know, I had to bring Hitler into the thing, but Hitler's, Mr. German eugenics program was actually
[00:32:46.477 --> 00:32:51.322]  Started in America by the mother of the late Admiral Harriman.
[00:32:51.762 --> 00:32:54.685]  She had a eugenic society based in Upper New York State.
[00:32:55.366 --> 00:33:10.881]  And she had a huge meeting in 19, uh, when I think it was about 1921, I'm not sure of the date, of the eugenic societies and a lot of German dignitaries came and that's actually where Hitler got his extermination policies.
[00:33:11.206 --> 00:33:15.629]  Well, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was fully bankrolled by the Rockefeller family on record.
[00:33:16.069 --> 00:33:19.491]  Absolutely correct.
[00:33:19.571 --> 00:33:24.614]  Let me throw this curveball in because, you know, there's big debates on the internet by people that don't do research.
[00:33:24.995 --> 00:33:30.818]  I understand it's an imperial, corporate, letter-of-mark, you know, commerce system.
[00:33:31.098 --> 00:33:35.981]  And that's how the globalists describe themselves, because I actually read their documents like you do.
[00:33:36.422 --> 00:33:39.844]  But there's this obsession with, it's Catholics that run it all.
[00:33:40.424 --> 00:33:42.485]  It's Jews that run it all, or it's this group.
[00:33:42.786 --> 00:33:54.273]  But when you look at it, it doesn't matter if it's Jews, Protestants, Catholics, Hindus, Japanese, Chinese, the top families are all part of this power structure and all push for the same thing.
[00:33:54.293 --> 00:34:07.782]  And I see it as very destructive, but I see this major eugenics, I don't want to say Nazi, because as you mentioned, it was just an off-growth of this, this scientific dictatorship, eugenics movement is at the heart of it, that's what it's all about, a super race,
[00:34:08.542 --> 00:34:13.326]  And then you have this big movement that, no, it's Rothschilds, it's Jews, they run it all.
[00:34:14.027 --> 00:34:19.832]  And then you do see powerful Jewish families supporting the eugenics movement, even though they get stung by it.
[00:34:20.172 --> 00:34:25.497]  So this is a very, I don't want to call it Nazi death cult, because, again, it predates that.
[00:34:26.578 --> 00:34:30.602]  So what is the main power makeup of the New World Order?
[00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:34.677]  Well, it's a one-world government.
[00:34:35.197 --> 00:34:50.562]  A one-world government composed of the members of the Committee of 300 inside a New World Order, where they propose to change every government in the world and make it submit to this New World Order government, and that's the one-world government.
[00:34:50.642 --> 00:34:52.163]  That's exactly what they're trying to do.
[00:34:55.091 --> 00:34:57.933]  They just want to have countries like the United States and China.
[00:34:57.973 --> 00:35:03.417]  They want a one world government where loyalty to nationality will no longer be an issue.
[00:35:05.799 --> 00:35:08.821]  And so it's not, from your research, a racial conspiracy.
[00:35:08.881 --> 00:35:09.582]  It's an idea.
[00:35:09.602 --> 00:35:10.843]  It's an idea.
[00:35:10.863 --> 00:35:14.085]  It's an idea that they said has come.
[00:35:14.506 --> 00:35:15.186]  Time has come.
[00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:19.630]  And they're running behind their timetable because they've been thought of opposition.
[00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:20.550]  For instance, Stalin.
[00:35:21.391 --> 00:35:22.572]  As bad a guy as he was.
[00:35:23.769 --> 00:35:24.669]  He had his good points.
[00:35:24.709 --> 00:35:26.290]  He threw a spanner in the works of this.
[00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:33.233]  He said, I'm not going to be beheld in a great country like Russia to a bunch of cosmopolitans meeting in New York.
[00:35:33.933 --> 00:35:35.474]  And he said, we'll fight them to the end.
[00:35:35.674 --> 00:35:36.974]  And that's exactly what he did.
[00:35:37.074 --> 00:35:43.037]  And of course, Russia today is still a thorn in the side of the flesh of this organization because they have not joined it.
[00:35:43.497 --> 00:35:48.759]  In spite of the pressure to wreck their economy, which very nearly succeeded at one stage, but
[00:35:49.395 --> 00:35:53.437]  Thanks to Putin coming in, they managed to pull themselves around.
[00:35:54.098 --> 00:35:57.579]  And you can know that they're vast, vast natural resources.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.921]  Russia should be one of the greatest countries in the world.
[00:36:00.841 --> 00:36:05.624]  But they've been robbed blind by people in the past, these enormous, powerful combines.
[00:36:06.994 --> 00:36:24.446]  Well, I mean, specifically from my research, when the globalist puppet was kicked out, then you got the drunken semi-puppet who was then replaced by his Vice President Putin.
[00:36:25.066 --> 00:36:30.310]  So Boris Yeltsin, from my research, was a puppet, did let the banking oligarchs come in and take over.
[00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:31.711]  He did.
[00:36:32.331 --> 00:36:35.993]  But then Putin kicked them out of the nation.
[00:36:37.514 --> 00:36:38.234]  That's what he did.
[00:36:38.695 --> 00:36:38.935]  Yes.
[00:36:39.335 --> 00:36:40.615]  That's exactly what happened.
[00:36:41.196 --> 00:36:42.816]  Yeltsin was a drunken puppet.
[00:36:43.556 --> 00:36:47.258]  And he lived in a fog of alcoholic haze all of his life.
[00:36:47.798 --> 00:36:49.039]  His adult life, anyway.
[00:36:49.639 --> 00:36:53.940]  And Russia was teetering on the very, very brink when Putin came to power.
[00:36:54.541 --> 00:36:58.282]  And he cancelled all his monopolies and all of these international bankers fled.
[00:36:58.942 --> 00:37:00.123]  Many of them fled to England.
[00:37:00.463 --> 00:37:02.003]  Most of them went to Israel.
[00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:08.670]  Berezovsky is the big man in England who runs the show there.
[00:37:09.311 --> 00:37:11.992]  He owns football clubs and enormous property holdings.
[00:37:12.012 --> 00:37:13.533]  He's an extremely wealthy man.
[00:37:13.894 --> 00:37:19.397]  And the Russians have asked repeatedly for him to extradite him to Russia, and they refused to do so.
[00:37:21.458 --> 00:37:26.081]  You know, you'd think for all of Russia's power, they could do something about Mr. Berezovsky.
[00:37:26.581 --> 00:37:30.023]  Well, they did go over and assassinate one guy who was close to him.
[00:37:30.043 --> 00:37:33.205]  They poisoned him with plutonium, a terrible death.
[00:37:34.028 --> 00:37:36.009]  But they've not been able to get near to him.
[00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:38.351]  He lives in a guarded compound.
[00:37:38.911 --> 00:37:42.113]  And he never goes around except with about 10 or 12 bodyguards.
[00:37:43.073 --> 00:37:50.958]  And usually, Russia does not like to commit atrocities in public if they're going to assassinate a guy done in secret.
[00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:56.241]  And I spoke to one of the Russian generals myself once.
[00:37:56.981 --> 00:37:58.963]  He didn't want to say too much about it.
[00:37:58.983 --> 00:38:01.384]  He said, but they don't believe in making a spectacle.
[00:38:02.119 --> 00:38:04.100]  When they want to get rid of somebody.
[00:38:07.261 --> 00:38:11.263]  Though the Committee of 300 does like to make a spectacle, I've noticed.
[00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:12.884]  Oh yes, it does.
[00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:18.606]  But as I said, Russia's been on the thwarted side of the Committee of 300 for many, many years.
[00:38:18.866 --> 00:38:22.648]  From Stalin's days, they refused to obey the dictates of the Committee.
[00:38:23.989 --> 00:38:24.989]  And it cost them dearly.
[00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:31.572]  You know, it's interesting, Albert Gore's been in the news lately.
[00:38:32.765 --> 00:38:42.008]  And his father actually got many of the concessions that were given out by Yeltsin, and he was extremely rich from that.
[00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:46.190]  It's amazing.
[00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:53.453]  Now, again, going back to Russia, this has got to be upsetting, the New World Order clan.
[00:38:53.833 --> 00:38:56.414]  Now, for my research, though, the committee did help
[00:38:57.358 --> 00:39:04.604]  Knock off their cousin, the Tsar, and did help put the Bolsheviks in, or is that incorrect from your research?
[00:39:04.624 --> 00:39:06.025]  No, that's absolutely correct.
[00:39:06.045 --> 00:39:06.866]  They did do that.
[00:39:07.666 --> 00:39:16.874]  They did get rid of the royal family of the Tsars, because the Tsars were trying to Christianize Russia, and that they didn't want.
[00:39:16.934 --> 00:39:24.880]  They wanted a nation of non-Christian people, so that they could easily get in and
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.721]  Completely compromised the whole situation.
[00:39:28.221 --> 00:39:36.203]  Because they found that statistically real Christians will create amazing independent local wealth and strong families, correct?
[00:39:36.443 --> 00:39:38.323]  That's exactly why they want to get rid of them.
[00:39:38.723 --> 00:39:43.624]  And if you notice that all of the Bolshevik leaders were actually non-Russian people.
[00:39:43.985 --> 00:39:44.645]  Every one of them.
[00:39:45.665 --> 00:39:50.046]  All the people who fomented the Bolshevik Revolution were non-Russian nationals.
[00:39:50.146 --> 00:39:53.767]  In other words, they were not... They were born in Russia, but they were
[00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:57.234]  They were able to speak Russian, but they were not of the soil of Russia.
[00:39:57.314 --> 00:39:58.380]  They were not actually Russian.
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:04.661]  All right, shifting gears yet again in the time we've got, and I want to get you back up in the next few weeks.
[00:40:04.701 --> 00:40:08.242]  I don't know how it's been years, years, I think eight years since we've had you on.
[00:40:09.643 --> 00:40:21.466]  You just blink and decades flash past, but in the time we've got left, you do concur with many of the other experts we have on and the Globalist on statements that they're in trouble.
[00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:27.888]  How much trouble from your expert analysis are they in, and what are you concerned about being their next move?
[00:40:29.301 --> 00:40:36.383]  The next move I'm afraid of being concerned that they will try to bring in totalitarian government in through the back door.
[00:40:37.003 --> 00:40:48.106]  And if you look at many of the bills and measures that Obama has passed, these smack of socialism to a degree I've never seen before in American politics.
[00:40:49.006 --> 00:40:52.327]  And this is the kind of sneaky backdoor entrance that they hope to make.
[00:40:53.507 --> 00:40:56.208]  You know, an alert populace.
[00:40:56.826 --> 00:41:01.647]  We'll resist whatever is trying to upset their way of life.
[00:41:01.767 --> 00:41:08.568]  But a sleeping giant like the American people would not easily stop this.
[00:41:09.288 --> 00:41:12.029]  So they're trying to lull them into a false sense of security.
[00:41:13.089 --> 00:41:25.631]  And I think that the pronouncements and the measures that have been passed by the Obama administration are the most socialistic I've ever encountered in America's history.
[00:41:27.386 --> 00:41:31.308]  Well, we're seeing open pushes to shut down free speech.
[00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:36.991]  We're seeing naked body scanners where they admit they record your naked body now to break our will.
[00:41:38.271 --> 00:41:40.272]  The paramilitarization of police.
[00:41:40.312 --> 00:41:41.973]  The open federalization of police.
[00:41:42.833 --> 00:41:45.835]  All these leaders pushing for the secret arrest of citizens.
[00:41:46.275 --> 00:41:48.616]  The extrajudicial stripping of our citizenship.
[00:41:48.876 --> 00:41:49.777]  I mean, that's 110% bona fide tyranny.
[00:41:53.038 --> 00:41:53.398]  It is.
[00:41:53.918 --> 00:41:59.460]  But you see, what they are striving to do is to abolish the Constitution altogether.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:06.663]  But if they can't do that in one fell swoop, then what they're trying to do is abolish the state right, the 10th Amendment.
[00:42:07.463 --> 00:42:15.546]  And they think that this way, people will be much less powerful, and they'll be much more vulnerable for a takeover.
[00:42:16.326 --> 00:42:21.088]  And if you look at all the measures that have been aimed against state government, it's very, very alarming.
[00:42:21.803 --> 00:42:26.624]  Well, it's all designed to bankrupt them and turn them into vassal serfs who are going to break.
[00:42:26.944 --> 00:42:35.466]  That's why it's so important people get the film, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, with myself, Michael Magneric, Richard Mack, Charles Key, Cynthia Davis, Edwin Vieira, and others.
[00:42:35.826 --> 00:42:38.647]  This will teach you the difference between a republic and a democracy.
[00:42:39.087 --> 00:42:42.628]  This will show you how we get sheriffs elected, how we take the states back.
[00:42:43.808 --> 00:42:47.930]  As Victor Hugo said, no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[00:42:49.351 --> 00:42:52.572]  If you will simply carry the ball, folks, we are unstoppable.
[00:42:52.612 --> 00:42:55.313]  Get Don't Tread on Me at InfoWars.com.

[00:43:05.734 --> 00:43:08.895]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:43:09.275 --> 00:43:11.115]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:43:11.555 --> 00:43:11.975]  Don't!
[00:43:12.415 --> 00:43:15.456]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:43:15.856 --> 00:43:22.998]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:43:22.978 --> 00:43:24.638]  's number one debt secret.
[00:43:24.958 --> 00:43:28.619]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.

[00:43:31.762 --> 00:43:39.211]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:43:39.531 --> 00:43:40.532]  Herb K was right.
[00:43:40.732 --> 00:43:43.776]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:43:43.956 --> 00:43:44.957]  What have you got to lose?

[00:43:53.085 --> 00:43:53.125]  800-822-1291.
[00:44:05.549 --> 00:44:10.411]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:44:10.511 --> 00:44:11.291]  What have we got?
[00:44:11.492 --> 00:44:13.632]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:44:13.953 --> 00:44:14.673]  A republic.
[00:44:14.973 --> 00:44:17.534]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:44:17.614 --> 00:44:19.515]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:44:19.875 --> 00:44:21.776]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:44:21.896 --> 00:44:23.177]  So they think they own our land?
[00:44:23.577 --> 00:44:24.697]  They think they own our water?
[00:44:24.897 --> 00:44:25.297]  Children?
[00:44:25.498 --> 00:44:26.298]  Our education?
[00:44:26.618 --> 00:44:27.258]  Our money?
[00:44:27.458 --> 00:44:31.100]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:35.126]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:44:36.448 --> 00:44:37.289]  We have the facts.
[00:44:37.469 --> 00:44:38.591]  We have the Constitution.
[00:44:38.631 --> 00:44:39.512]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:44:39.552 --> 00:44:40.373]  We have common law.
[00:44:40.434 --> 00:44:42.677]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:42.957 --> 00:44:46.723]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:44:46.823 --> 00:44:51.607]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:44:51.787 --> 00:44:53.149]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:44:53.289 --> 00:44:54.129]  Don't tread on me.
[00:44:54.370 --> 00:45:01.236]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.

[00:46:11.506 --> 00:46:14.187]  I'm not your slave, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:15.168 --> 00:46:16.749]  I'm not the slave of the New World Order.
[00:46:16.769 --> 00:46:20.652]  We all need to basically declare that information publicly.
[00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:23.650]  Dr. John Coleman is our guest.
[00:46:24.911 --> 00:46:25.751]  This isn't a game.
[00:46:25.811 --> 00:46:26.631]  It's not a joke.
[00:46:26.711 --> 00:46:28.511]  It's not a drill.
[00:46:28.972 --> 00:46:30.252]  There is a world government.
[00:46:30.292 --> 00:46:31.212]  It's out in the open.
[00:46:31.312 --> 00:46:32.432]  The denial is over.
[00:46:33.032 --> 00:46:36.493]  We are going into high-tech slavery unless we turn this around.
[00:46:37.193 --> 00:46:45.695]  And the way these controllers get away with this is they have so many dumbed-down minions that serve them in compartmentalized positions who feel like they're part of the winning team.
[00:46:46.276 --> 00:46:47.756]  But this oppressive system
[00:46:48.556 --> 00:46:49.017]  I do, absolutely.
[00:46:49.037 --> 00:46:50.358]  That's only the beginning of the nightmare.
[00:47:07.065 --> 00:47:12.830]  Let's briefly talk about the nightmare, and then you're going to join us coming up in about a week and a half on Monday the 14th for part two.
[00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:20.236]  But if they are able to get their scientific dictatorship in place, which they're very close to, what is the nightmare?
[00:47:21.037 --> 00:47:25.300]  The nightmare will be that you will have no more rights of any kind.
[00:47:25.761 --> 00:47:28.003]  You'll be told exactly what to do, when to do.
[00:47:28.023 --> 00:47:31.225]  You'll be told what type of employment you can have or not have.
[00:47:32.126 --> 00:47:34.368]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[00:47:35.802 --> 00:47:41.904]  In other words, every individual in the United States will be fully controlled and told exactly what he can and cannot do.
[00:47:41.964 --> 00:47:52.308]  Yeah, I saw Bill Gates a few weeks ago bragging that he loves China because they're now deciding what children will be off of their DNA.
[00:47:52.608 --> 00:47:57.610]  But of course, in the state can claim whatever they want and say that your DNA shows this or that.
[00:47:58.110 --> 00:47:59.450]  I mean, this is total control.
[00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:04.632]  This is them taking control of the human species, of our evolutionary development.
[00:48:05.683 --> 00:48:07.084]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[00:48:07.164 --> 00:48:11.487]  They've always said that man is nothing more than a mind and matter.
[00:48:11.507 --> 00:48:19.812]  He's not an intelligent being, even, and he is born to be controlled, and we're the people who are going to do the controlling.
[00:48:21.433 --> 00:48:26.156]  So, that's more or less the situation with him.
[00:48:26.536 --> 00:48:28.857]  But we can take heart, though, in the awakening.
[00:48:29.958 --> 00:48:32.720]  Are they concerned about the awakening that's happening, Doctor?
[00:48:35.708 --> 00:48:38.121]  Excuse me a minute, there's another phone ringing in my office.
[00:48:38.141 --> 00:48:39.226]  I'm trying to disconnect it.
[00:48:40.034 --> 00:48:40.895]  All right, I understand.
[00:48:40.915 --> 00:48:51.604]  Again, we're going to have him back up with us next week, or not next week, the Monday following next week, about 10-11 days from now for a Part 2 interview.
[00:48:51.644 --> 00:48:52.985]  So many great patriots out there.
[00:48:53.025 --> 00:48:56.388]  And I remember over a decade ago reading his book and learning so much.
[00:48:56.428 --> 00:49:04.755]  And since then, you know, I've done my own research separately into many areas and just continue to realize how groundbreaking this information is.
[00:49:05.976 --> 00:49:13.098]  For those that just joined us, it's so important for people to see the film in-game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, so they understand the agenda we're facing.
[00:49:13.718 --> 00:49:22.021]  Sir, you were finishing up with commenting on the fact that they've been exposed and they are concerned.
[00:49:22.081 --> 00:49:23.221]  How concerned are they?
[00:49:23.901 --> 00:49:29.583]  They're very concerned because you've got... You know, Stalin knew about this game to happen a long time ago.
[00:49:29.603 --> 00:49:34.144]  That's why he demanded to get the atom bomb from the United States.
[00:49:34.966 --> 00:49:45.134]  Because he said he didn't tell his friends, Roosevelt and company, what he wanted them for, but he said that this would definitely be needed for him to cooperate with them.
[00:49:45.194 --> 00:49:50.018]  He wanted, said, to defend Russia, but he really was going to defend Russia against the New World Order.
[00:49:50.899 --> 00:49:55.203]  And he did not wish the people in Russia to be subject to that.
[00:49:55.823 --> 00:49:56.984]  So he wasn't all bad.
[00:49:57.064 --> 00:49:58.465]  Of course, he wasn't really a Russian.
[00:49:58.485 --> 00:49:59.266]  He was a Georgian.
[00:50:00.167 --> 00:50:02.709]  But that is basically
[00:50:03.385 --> 00:50:07.508]  The intent to enslave everybody in a new world order, one world government system.
[00:50:08.088 --> 00:50:17.674]  Now it sounds very far-fetched, but there's a great deal of logic behind it, and there's a great deal of information that I was managed, I managed on Earth.
[00:50:17.734 --> 00:50:19.975]  Well, sir, you've been talking about this for decades.
[00:50:20.015 --> 00:50:21.276]  Now it's out in the open.
[00:50:21.336 --> 00:50:21.937]  It is H.G.
[00:50:22.397 --> 00:50:23.618]  Wells' open conspiracy.
[00:50:23.638 --> 00:50:24.698]  It is now.
[00:50:24.878 --> 00:50:25.279]  It is now.
[00:50:25.299 --> 00:50:30.082]  And as I was saying in the beginning, people said I was off the wall and I belonged in lunatic asylum.
[00:50:30.102 --> 00:50:31.943]  I had many insults hurled at me.
[00:50:38.773 --> 00:50:43.136]  And we've gone from almost no one knowing about this to the whole world being awake.
[00:50:43.196 --> 00:50:45.157]  God bless you sir, we'll talk to you in a week and a half.
[00:50:45.898 --> 00:50:50.862]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:50:51.502 --> 00:50:54.725]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:55.245 --> 00:50:56.506]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:56.546 --> 00:51:01.890]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:02.131 --> 00:51:06.754]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:07.155 --> 00:51:07.555]  It's true.
[00:51:07.635 --> 00:51:10.217]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:51:10.437 --> 00:51:12.199]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:51:12.719 --> 00:51:17.422]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:17.943 --> 00:51:19.864]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:51:20.264 --> 00:51:24.867]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:25.067 --> 00:51:25.968]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:26.188 --> 00:51:28.950]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:32.552]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:51:32.873 --> 00:51:35.714]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:51:36.055 --> 00:51:37.956]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:51:38.296 --> 00:51:39.217]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:51:42.939 --> 00:51:46.562]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:47.083 --> 00:51:51.606]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:51.906 --> 00:51:54.368]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:51:58.412 --> 00:52:00.313]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:52:00.793 --> 00:52:03.556]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:24.492]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into this fourth and final hour.
[00:52:24.772 --> 00:52:38.156]  We have a guest joining us, Charlie Skelton, writer for the Evening Standard and the London Guardian, from Spain, at the 2010 Global Government Conference, the Bilderberg Group Conference, that kicks off tomorrow.
[00:52:38.176 --> 00:52:41.397]  They've already closed the hotel and globalists are arriving.
[00:52:43.418 --> 00:52:45.198]  And here's the headline, our man at Bilderberg, 2010.
[00:52:50.063 --> 00:52:56.909]  So that is coming up in about 30 minutes with that information.
[00:52:59.051 --> 00:53:11.062]  Now, for the first half of this hour, I want to get Paul Joseph Watson on, who wrote the article last week for PrisonPlanet.com dealing with the Open Conspiracy, the Bilderberg Group.
[00:53:12.143 --> 00:53:13.204]  And, I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:20.974]  They psychologically for the last half century told you there's no world government, no banking elite, no such thing as fractional reserve banking.
[00:53:21.294 --> 00:53:22.557]  The Federal Reserve is federal.
[00:53:23.584 --> 00:53:24.365]  Just forget about it.
[00:53:24.925 --> 00:53:26.426]  Now they've engineered a global collapse.
[00:53:26.486 --> 00:53:27.747]  They're bringing in world government.
[00:53:28.928 --> 00:53:34.072]  They're preparing to plunge the dollar and the euro even more, openly announcing world government.
[00:53:34.552 --> 00:53:37.094]  But all the yuppies have been told it doesn't exist.
[00:53:37.654 --> 00:53:41.837]  So even when the news admits world government's here, the yuppie says, well, I'm a winner.
[00:53:42.078 --> 00:53:44.099]  And winners don't recognize that exists.
[00:53:44.459 --> 00:53:48.662]  So I'm going to let the government take my job and my pension fund because I'm a trendy.
[00:53:49.483 --> 00:53:51.004]  Well, they're going to do what they're going to do.
[00:53:51.424 --> 00:53:54.746]  We've got to reach out to people that understand what's happening and reverse all this.
[00:53:54.766 --> 00:53:58.288]  So a lot of news coming out right now out of Bilderberg.
[00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:06.293]  We've also got the Times of London and others reporting the secret of Bilderberg Club ready for protest.
[00:54:06.733 --> 00:54:14.879]  So we've gone from world government not existing to the media admitting it's being set up and people aren't addressing the puppet presidents and prime ministers anymore.
[00:54:15.159 --> 00:54:17.301]  They're addressing the actual power structure.
[00:54:17.601 --> 00:54:22.385]  And that's why Brzezinski said two weeks ago, top global strategist, that the new world order is in trouble.
[00:54:22.625 --> 00:54:27.709]  Because for the first time in world history, the entire globe is awake to the true power structure.
[00:54:27.729 --> 00:54:28.890]  So we should all be celebrating.
[00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:33.933]  Once the real enemy is identified, they can now be defeated instead of us fighting windmills.
[00:54:34.234 --> 00:54:35.855]  Paul Watson joining us from England.
[00:54:36.195 --> 00:54:37.396]  Breakdown the latest developments.
[00:54:38.677 --> 00:54:40.078]  Hello Alex, good to be back.
[00:54:40.598 --> 00:54:45.021]  And there we have it ladies and gentlemen, Paul Watson via video Skype.
[00:54:46.121 --> 00:54:48.143]  Looking like the Grinch that stole Christmas.
[00:54:50.484 --> 00:54:52.706]  Hey Watson, good to have you here with us.
[00:54:53.526 --> 00:54:54.427]  A lot going on.
[00:54:54.487 --> 00:54:58.049]  So many years interviewing him and to have him from England on video, it's just weird.
[00:54:58.889 --> 00:55:02.592]  Watson, we're about to go to break, but tell us what's coming up after the break.
[00:55:04.178 --> 00:55:12.142]  Well yeah, the fact that Bilderberg is now an open conspiracy is exemplified today with this London Times article.
[00:55:12.303 --> 00:55:21.328]  Ten years ago, the London Times, which is the premier establishment newspaper next to the New York Times and Washington Post, they wouldn't even
[00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:31.396]  mentioned the fact that Bilderberg existed and now today they're reporting not only who's attending but what their agenda will be.
[00:55:32.137 --> 00:55:40.383]  So, again, that underscores the fact that everything that Bilderberg are talking about is now public and is now in our faces.
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:50.968]  Also, you've got a report out at PrisonPlanet.com about Iran announcing 40 plus billion dollars of U.S.
[00:55:50.988 --> 00:55:53.412]  currency they're going to dump in favor of gold.
[00:55:53.472 --> 00:55:54.754]  That should cause some fireworks.
[00:55:56.308 --> 00:56:07.593]  Well, that's right, because Bilderberg are basically in a blind panic about the Euro collapsing, because for them it represents the embryonic global currency.
[00:56:08.033 --> 00:56:23.300]  We know that the ultimate agenda is to move towards a one-world currency, and that's exactly what IMF chief and Bilderberg member Dominique Strasse-Kahn recently said at a meeting of elitists in Zurich.
[00:56:24.761 --> 00:56:41.594]  They're in a blind panic about the situation with the Euro, and now that Iran and other central banks in the Gulf are quickly heading for the exit door, it's a big panic situation amongst the Bilderberg members.
[00:56:45.236 --> 00:56:49.640]  Paul Watson joining us via video Skype from England straight ahead.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:51.122]  By the way, the audio is awesome.
[00:56:51.162 --> 00:56:52.183]  It's like he's in studio.
[00:56:53.043 --> 00:56:53.504]  I love it.

[00:57:12.337 --> 00:57:17.119]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:57:17.479 --> 00:57:24.521]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:57:26.202 --> 00:57:28.523]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:57:30.283 --> 00:57:32.224]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:57:34.571 --> 00:57:38.592]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:57:39.312 --> 00:57:42.413]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:57:43.133 --> 00:57:43.953]  Others don't.
[00:57:44.353 --> 00:57:46.254]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:57:46.514 --> 00:57:48.014]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:57:48.294 --> 00:57:50.855]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[00:58:09.355 --> 00:58:10.276]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:10.616 --> 00:58:14.180]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:14.481 --> 00:58:16.763]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:58:16.783 --> 00:58:22.229]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:58:22.649 --> 00:58:28.876]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:58:29.296 --> 00:58:34.857]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:58:35.277 --> 00:58:38.958]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:58:39.458 --> 00:58:43.459]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:58:43.739 --> 00:58:49.280]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:52.680]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:54.661]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:58:55.221 --> 00:58:55.661]  It's here.

[00:59:05.626 --> 00:59:08.227]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:59:08.647 --> 00:59:13.588]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:59:13.968 --> 00:59:15.709]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:16.009 --> 00:59:20.830]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:21.010 --> 00:59:21.971]  How much do you want?
[00:59:22.191 --> 00:59:22.951]  When do you want it?
[00:59:23.311 --> 00:59:24.912]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:25.212 --> 00:59:26.032]  When will you need it?
[00:59:26.272 --> 00:59:28.333]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:28.473 --> 00:59:29.473]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:29.813 --> 00:59:33.716]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[00:59:33.876 --> 00:59:36.397]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:36.598 --> 00:59:39.780]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:43.702]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:44.002 --> 00:59:45.003]  How much will you need?
[00:59:45.243 --> 00:59:45.844]  We don't know.
[00:59:46.144 --> 00:59:47.065]  How much do you want?
[00:59:47.245 --> 00:59:47.985]  All you can get.
[00:59:48.185 --> 00:59:49.026]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:49.286 --> 00:59:52.028]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:52.328 --> 00:59:54.069]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com
[00:59:59.833 --> 01:00:03.735]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.220]  Big Brother.
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:12.941]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:13.642 --> 01:00:14.782]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:16.243]  You want answers?
[01:00:16.984 --> 01:00:17.924]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:17.944 --> 01:00:22.187]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:22.707 --> 01:00:26.770]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.336 --> 01:00:37.441]  Alright, Paul Joseph Watson, the editor of PrisonPlanet.com, joins us for the next twenty minutes or so.
[01:00:37.501 --> 01:00:42.504]  Then we have London Guardian reporter Charlie Skelton joining us from Spain, the side of Bilderberg, 2010.
[01:00:44.585 --> 01:00:51.590]  Watson, you've written a lot of articles about what's happening globally around the planet, what's happening with the economy, with currencies, and of course the Bilderberg Group.
[01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:55.652]  If we have new listeners tuning in, we're saying, why do we care about the Bilderberg Group?
[01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:57.273]  Well, as Jim Tucker
[01:00:58.368 --> 01:01:06.914]  And many others have proven they can predict two, three, four years beforehand what's going to happen from their sources in Bilderberg and also talking to people.
[01:01:07.234 --> 01:01:08.475]  They'll get there a few days before.
[01:01:09.216 --> 01:01:10.436]  I've done this myself a few times.
[01:01:10.516 --> 01:01:16.200]  Talk to the servants, you know, the staff at the five-star hotels, and they'll say, I've been told not to talk to you, I'll be fired.
[01:01:16.541 --> 01:01:20.904]  And I go, after you're treated like crud, after you hear them openly laugh about enslaving us,
[01:01:21.624 --> 01:01:23.965]  You know, give me your number and I'll call you after the fact.
[01:01:24.105 --> 01:01:27.267]  And then they call you going, my God, they're planning to enslave us.
[01:01:27.807 --> 01:01:28.688]  I want to tell you.
[01:01:29.248 --> 01:01:30.529]  And you find out everything.
[01:01:30.869 --> 01:01:32.650]  And we've been on record with all of this.
[01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:36.952]  And of course, it's just one of the big meeting groups of the overall world government.
[01:01:37.452 --> 01:01:41.234]  But Watson, let's break down what's happening with the world government right now.
[01:01:41.254 --> 01:01:47.937]  Because the good news from every source, including Zbigniew Brzezinski, one of their top minions, is that they are getting in deep trouble.
[01:01:48.377 --> 01:01:51.039]  And you know, they're kind of like the cartoon cat.
[01:01:51.559 --> 01:02:07.282]  in a old cartoon with a hundred dishes and plates trying to trying to balance things and it's only a matter of time till they stumble of course in that process it's gonna be very very uh... messy uh... should we say so joining us via video skype paul joseph watson break it down
[01:02:08.663 --> 01:02:12.204]  Well yeah, just to pick up on what you just mentioned with the secrecy aspect.
[01:02:13.904 --> 01:02:20.326]  They're having problems with leaks coming out of Bilderberg, and obviously this has intensified over the last few years.
[01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:33.749]  And now we learn, out of the London Times report today, that most Bilderberg members, certainly the most prominent ones that are going to be there today, are bringing their own staff
[01:02:34.449 --> 01:02:54.327]  So whereas they'd normally rely on hotel staff to do all the cooking and cleaning and washing and providing all the services for them, now they're bringing their own in-house staff and that's explicitly to prevent leaks of information getting out to Bilderberg sleuths that are there on the scene.
[01:02:54.787 --> 01:02:58.570]  So they're very concerned about secrecy and things coming out.
[01:02:59.511 --> 01:03:14.234]  But as we've, you know, the theme is that it is now an open conspiracy because Bildberg members who, um, get together once a year are revealing their agenda to their own flock beforehand.
[01:03:14.674 --> 01:03:24.415]  And this comes out in, uh, CFR speeches and in speeches such as the one I mentioned before the break, Dominique Strass-Kahn, who gave a speech in Zurich.
[01:03:24.475 --> 01:03:28.416]  So all this is coming out before they even meet, which is why
[01:03:29.704 --> 01:03:47.754]  The topics of their conversations are already known to us beforehand, and certainly top of the agenda this year is the collapse of the Euro, because for Bilderberg, the Euro represents their embryonic one-world currency.
[01:03:48.414 --> 01:03:58.480]  Now, they already broke the terms of their own Maastricht Treaty to bail out Greece, which they said they would never do, but they did it because
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:03:59.700]  Yeah.
[01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:25.093]  All but derail their wider agenda for a one world currency.
[01:04:25.174 --> 01:04:28.696]  And of course I had Greg Pallast on, who I'm going to get back on by the way next week, guys.
[01:04:29.117 --> 01:04:36.083]  I had him on a few weeks ago and he talked about meeting with some of the, a BBC reporter, high level, with some of the founders of Euro.
[01:04:36.103 --> 01:04:45.731]  And they bragged, the Euro was set up to take control of nations and rob them as an IMF World Bank extraction arm, just like they do Africa, Asia, Latin America.
[01:04:46.872 --> 01:04:48.633]  And that this was the plan all along.
[01:04:49.054 --> 01:04:55.420]  And so they're holding Europe hostage saying we're going to economically destroy you and you're going to give us all your money and your pension funds and everything.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:03.948]  And our media is selling it like oh those lazy Europeans they just want three vacations a year and you know they want to be able to retire when they're 55 instead of 65.
[01:05:04.268 --> 01:05:05.470]  They deserve what's happening.
[01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:09.494]  The truth is we can produce unlimited wealth if this fractional reserve
[01:05:10.495 --> 01:05:13.218]  Debt black hole was removed.
[01:05:13.238 --> 01:05:14.259]  This is not free market.
[01:05:14.279 --> 01:05:16.381]  This is parasite market.
[01:05:16.401 --> 01:05:25.852]  So the battle is joined with Deutschland, Germany, which are big New World Order people, saying politically, no, we're not going along with fresh rounds of looting.
[01:05:25.932 --> 01:05:29.597]  So all is not well in the kingdom of the New World Order.
[01:05:30.984 --> 01:05:31.624]  Well, that's right.
[01:05:31.644 --> 01:05:54.440]  I mean, that's exactly what Brzezinski said during his CFR speech a couple of weeks ago, that not only was there a global awakening taking place amongst the people, but there was massive infighting within the elite itself, and Germany is very upset about what the EU, what certain blocks of the EU were forced to do with Greece.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:06:00.684]  So now, at the Bilderberg Conference in Barcelona, just outside Barcelona,
[01:06:02.084 --> 01:06:12.589]  The key men who will be attending are from Spain, obviously, but not only because it's in Spain, but because Spain could become the next Greece.
[01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:19.832]  And if Spain goes the same way as Greece, then the Euro is basically heading for the toilet.
[01:06:19.892 --> 01:06:23.013]  Yeah, they've already lost their AAA rating last week.
[01:06:24.482 --> 01:06:42.315]  Yeah, they lost the AAA rating, so now the Spanish Prime Minister, Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, is going to give the keynote opening address at Bilderberg, and he's going to be accompanied by the Spanish Foreign Minister, as well as Spain's former Economy Minister.
[01:06:44.076 --> 01:07:01.053]  They're basically there to try and reassure the Bilderberg members that Spain won't go the same way as Greece with massive crippling debts which of course lead to these austerity measures which provoke the riots that we've seen across Greece in the last couple of months.
[01:07:01.734 --> 01:07:05.117]  So you've got a heavy presence from Spain and
[01:07:06.687 --> 01:07:08.509]  That's because Spain is in trouble.
[01:07:09.591 --> 01:07:13.456]  Part of their problem is not just related to the economic meltdown.
[01:07:13.997 --> 01:07:20.425]  It's because of Spain's disastrous effort to implement the green economy.
[01:07:21.807 --> 01:07:40.435]  Which they were mandated to do by Bilderberg policies, specifically the EU Commission head Barroso, who coined the term post-industrial revolution, and the green economy is part of that post-industrial revolution.
[01:07:40.435 --> 01:07:45.696]  And it's designed to destroy your economy so you can't pay the bankers back, so they come in and take over.
[01:07:46.037 --> 01:07:47.957]  I mean, it's literally economic warfare.
[01:07:48.397 --> 01:08:09.143]  In the words of the Club of Rome, of the UN, of the head of NASA, of the White House Science Czar, I mean, this is a group of control freaks engaging in economic siege, and they are carrying this operation out, and we must have Europe throw their behinds out of there.
[01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:19.866]  Yeah, and it's an agenda to reduce living standards, which is what is happening in Europe as the taxes go up and the public services get cut.
[01:08:20.507 --> 01:08:23.391]  And it's being felt most painfully in Spain.
[01:08:24.052 --> 01:08:26.055]  You've got an unemployment rate in Spain of 18%.
[01:08:27.978 --> 01:08:38.841]  And that is a consequence of this green economy, because for every job created as part of the green economy, more than 2.2 jobs are lost.
[01:08:39.542 --> 01:08:51.586]  And in fact, a leaked internal document that came out of Spain a couple of weeks ago said that the rate of job loss is in fact worse than 2.2 jobs for everyone gained.
[01:08:53.086 --> 01:09:01.288]  The report basically said if we don't get out of this post-industrial revolution, this green economy, we're going to face economic ruin.
[01:09:02.009 --> 01:09:20.914]  So that's what the Spanish political leaders are at Bilderberg to discuss, is how they can extricate themselves from this green economy, rescue their own economy, and in turn rescue the euro, which is what Bilderberg and the globalists in general need to do.
[01:09:21.574 --> 01:09:26.338]  If confidence will remain in their agenda to create a global currency.
[01:09:26.818 --> 01:09:33.744]  Because if the Euro goes, then a big part of their agenda to centralise the world economic system goes.
[01:09:35.607 --> 01:09:43.049]  Separately, your report that's also in Press TV, the official organ of Tehran, that fits into this.
[01:09:43.069 --> 01:09:50.972]  More and more of the Arab nations and the Persians and the Iranians are saying they're dumping the dollar right now and going to gold.
[01:09:51.032 --> 01:09:53.392]  And of course you notice gold's been up the last few days.
[01:09:54.573 --> 01:09:55.453]  Break that down for us.
[01:09:57.369 --> 01:10:07.618]  Yeah, the Central Bank of Iran announced today that they were going to dump 45 billion euros and exchange it for gold bullion and dollars.
[01:10:08.839 --> 01:10:14.984]  And also Chinese state media reported that several Gulf states were going to do the same thing.
[01:10:15.705 --> 01:10:17.947]  Now the major central banks are
[01:10:18.607 --> 01:10:19.187]  Desperately
[01:10:35.712 --> 01:10:36.072]  I don't
[01:10:55.461 --> 01:11:00.322]  That intervention would buoy the currency and it would last for days or weeks.
[01:11:00.822 --> 01:11:09.324]  But as we've seen today, with the euro flat or even down against the dollar, the last time I looked about an hour ago, it doesn't work anymore.
[01:11:09.524 --> 01:11:22.166]  Even though the central banks are intervening, investors and other countries like Iran and Gulf states are still aggressively dumping the euro because they've read the predictions of
[01:11:23.126 --> 01:11:30.917]  Big financial houses like BNP Paribas who say that the euro is going to parity against the dollar by next year.
[01:11:31.097 --> 01:11:34.201]  And of course, the dollar is going to soon follow in its footsteps.
[01:11:34.221 --> 01:11:38.567]  When we come back, absolutely, when we come back we're going to get your take from the Times of London.
[01:11:38.687 --> 01:11:40.349]  Greece urged to give up euro.
[01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:50.133]  The Greek government has been advised by British economists to leave the Euro in default on its 300 billion pound debt to save its economy.
[01:11:50.593 --> 01:11:59.477]  The Center for Economics and Business Research, a London-based consultancy, has warned Greek ministers they will be unable to escape their debt trap without devaluing their currency to boost exports.
[01:11:59.797 --> 01:12:00.857]  And that's actually true!
[01:12:01.357 --> 01:12:05.199]  We'll be right back and get Watson's take on this and the Flotilla incident.
[01:12:05.239 --> 01:12:05.639]  Stay with us.

[01:13:58.072 --> 01:13:58.732]  Again, that's 418-844-9111.
[01:14:06.107 --> 01:14:10.971]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:11.832]  What have we got?
[01:14:12.052 --> 01:14:14.174]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:14:14.514 --> 01:14:15.235]  A republic.
[01:14:15.515 --> 01:14:18.097]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:14:18.157 --> 01:14:20.079]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:14:20.439 --> 01:14:22.341]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:14:22.461 --> 01:14:23.742]  So they think they own our land?
[01:14:24.142 --> 01:14:25.263]  They think they own our water?
[01:14:25.464 --> 01:14:25.864]  Children?
[01:14:26.064 --> 01:14:26.845]  Our education?
[01:14:27.185 --> 01:14:27.806]  Our money?
[01:14:28.006 --> 01:14:31.669]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:14:32.029 --> 01:14:35.674]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:14:35.714 --> 01:14:36.675]  You'll be warned.
[01:14:36.996 --> 01:14:37.817]  We have the facts.
[01:14:38.017 --> 01:14:39.138]  We have the Constitution.
[01:14:39.178 --> 01:14:40.060]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:40.921]  We have common law.
[01:14:40.981 --> 01:14:43.224]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:09.353]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:15:09.773 --> 01:15:14.715]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:15:15.095 --> 01:15:16.815]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:15:17.136 --> 01:15:21.957]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:15:22.137 --> 01:15:23.098]  How much do you want?
[01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:24.058]  When do you want it?
[01:15:24.438 --> 01:15:26.039]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.140]  When will you need it?
[01:15:27.401 --> 01:15:29.462]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:15:29.602 --> 01:15:30.703]  Will there be any food?
[01:15:30.944 --> 01:15:32.285]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:15:32.465 --> 01:15:37.529]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:15:37.729 --> 01:15:40.872]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:15:41.312 --> 01:15:44.813]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:15:45.133 --> 01:15:46.113]  How much will you need?
[01:15:46.353 --> 01:15:46.973]  We don't know.
[01:15:47.253 --> 01:15:48.173]  How much do you want?
[01:15:48.373 --> 01:15:49.093]  All you can get.
[01:15:49.293 --> 01:15:50.134]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:50.394 --> 01:15:53.134]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:15:53.434 --> 01:15:55.194]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:15:55.214 --> 01:15:56.135]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:16:16.482 --> 01:16:19.949]  By the way, this video Skype is working so well from England.
[01:16:20.670 --> 01:16:22.454]  Really, Watson has great political...
[01:16:23.999 --> 01:16:25.060]  Understanding and research.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.201]  That's why he's one of our chief writers and webmasters.
[01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:33.344]  I remember eight, nine years ago when I hired him, watching some of the work he was doing and thinking it was first rate.
[01:16:33.944 --> 01:16:35.505]  He's been part of the team for a long time.
[01:16:35.565 --> 01:16:40.328]  So now that we have this, this is a great video slash audio connection to England.
[01:16:40.348 --> 01:16:47.592]  We may have to start having Watson sit in occasionally when I'm working on a film or out of town on assignment.
[01:16:48.432 --> 01:17:06.846]  Going back to Paul Watson in the four and a half minutes we've got left before we go to Spain and talk about the Bilderberg group to the nearby city of Sigis, where the airspace has now been closed for the owners, the criminal owners of the planet, to nest and plan their next rip-off.
[01:17:07.547 --> 01:17:08.307]  We went to break
[01:17:09.586 --> 01:17:15.613]  And we were talking about this headline, Greece urged to give up Euro.
[01:17:16.554 --> 01:17:19.498]  So this thing is really falling apart quickly, Watson.
[01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:37.938]  Yeah, and a lot of people in Greece said that that's exactly what they should do, but the leadership in Greece have been strong-armed by the globalists to not exit the Euro because it would only worsen the crisis of confidence in the Euro.
[01:17:39.719 --> 01:17:42.802]  This is what Bilderberg 2010 is going to be all about.
[01:17:43.042 --> 01:17:44.523]  How do we save the euro?
[01:17:44.983 --> 01:18:00.056]  Because everybody's predicting that it's going to go to parity with the dollar, and every time the central banks try and intervene and push the euro back up again when it gets to that 1.21 level, it just sinks straight back down again the next day.
[01:18:00.576 --> 01:18:01.858]  So, I mean, this is
[01:18:03.086 --> 01:18:06.629]  The euro represents their entire agenda for a world currency.
[01:18:06.689 --> 01:18:18.497]  So if confidence is lost in the euro, then it proves that their claims that stability comes with unity are completely false.
[01:18:18.577 --> 01:18:27.564]  So it won't allow them to exploit the economic crisis which they created further to get their world government, which is what they've called for.
[01:18:27.584 --> 01:18:30.186]  I want to go back to this article briefly.
[01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:31.167]  These little devils
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:33.781]  aren't gods.
[01:18:33.861 --> 01:18:37.864]  I mean, they're not in total control, but I think they're basically playing both sides.
[01:18:39.045 --> 01:18:50.234]  Because I remember Trilateral Commission documents from over 20 years ago where they were talking about building up a few competing global currencies and then letting them collapse to bring in the SDR.
[01:18:50.294 --> 01:18:59.602]  So these little devils could have a method to their madness where they're claiming they don't want the euro to go belly up, but that's actually a way to save the dollar and then roll it into an SDR.
[01:19:02.639 --> 01:19:15.783]  Well yeah, if the crisis in confidence in fiat money became so bad then, they would then try to exploit that crisis for a global currency based on SDRs.
[01:19:16.364 --> 01:19:24.746]  But I don't see them doing that because from every indication they need to save the euro because it represents their entire agenda.
[01:19:25.287 --> 01:19:26.227]  But you're right, I mean,
[01:19:26.707 --> 01:19:32.511]  They created the economic crisis from the bubbles that they manufactured, but it seems to be out of control.
[01:19:32.531 --> 01:19:47.660]  And it seems that many, even inside the globalist circles, are concerned that the plunge happened too soon and too fast, and now it threatens to wipe out some of the wealth of even those who were somewhat prepared for it.
[01:19:50.319 --> 01:20:01.583]  Bilderberg are talking about prolonging a financial recession for another year, but whether things are too far out of hand for them to adequately manage that situation remains to be seen.
[01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:06.365]  So that will be what comes out of Bilderberg this year.
[01:20:06.485 --> 01:20:13.488]  So we'll be watching for the different discussions that come out of the conference on that subject.
[01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:20.125]  Well, I was reading U.S., well at the time, colony newspaper articles.
[01:20:20.145 --> 01:20:25.391]  I have some books that are compendiums of newspaper articles and also captains' accounts.
[01:20:26.172 --> 01:20:29.035]  I was reading some naval accounts of Newfoundland
[01:20:29.275 --> 01:20:31.837]  and and and areas of the east coast on the u.s.
[01:20:32.297 --> 01:20:51.169]  which was colonies at the time uh... being robbed by pirates it would describe a ship of say eighteen guns with maybe sixty pirates on it robbing a port with two thousand sailors five hundred guns huge ships uh... and they even knew that the pirate ship in the uh... case of uh...
[01:20:52.310 --> 01:21:16.031]  of this particular uh... uh... pirate captain was coming and they still just surrendered to them it's the same thing that we're doing today we have this group of piratical new world order people and if we just get the will to say no to them and the will to see through their flim flam of telling us there's no world government the banks aren't robbing us and if we just stand up and wake up we can brush them aside
[01:21:16.892 --> 01:21:23.756]  If we just decide to beat them, I mean, can 2,000 people in a town with hundreds of ships beat 60 people?
[01:21:24.136 --> 01:21:25.156]  Well, of course we can!
[01:21:25.737 --> 01:21:29.839]  I mean, it's just complete cowardice, Watson, and it's the same parallel today.
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:39.324]  That's right, but we're slowly starting to turn the tide and, you know, getting anti-establishment candidates into office, and that's what they're afraid of.
[01:21:40.746 --> 01:21:41.367]  Absolutely.
[01:21:41.387 --> 01:21:44.370]  All right, Watson, we'll talk to you again next week via video Skype.
[01:21:45.170 --> 01:21:47.933]  Joining us here on air, he'll be popping in at least once next week.
[01:21:48.374 --> 01:21:50.976]  We'll go to Bilderberg in Spain next, straight ahead.
[01:21:51.477 --> 01:21:54.840]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv are the key websites.
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:55.881]  That's Infowars.com.
[01:21:55.901 --> 01:21:58.804]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:59.745 --> 01:22:02.407]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:05.342 --> 01:22:09.163]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:23:04.924 --> 01:23:07.205]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:23:07.225 --> 01:23:09.545]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:23:09.625 --> 01:23:12.386]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:23:12.826 --> 01:23:17.608]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:23:17.928 --> 01:23:22.129]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:23:22.449 --> 01:23:24.791]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:23:24.912 --> 01:23:27.314]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:23:27.334 --> 01:23:30.237]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:23:30.597 --> 01:23:38.205]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:23:38.536 --> 01:23:43.801]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:23:43.921 --> 01:23:46.723]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:23:46.763 --> 01:23:50.206]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:23:50.466 --> 01:23:51.387]  And I got news for you.
[01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:52.848]  You're everyone else.

[01:24:18.827 --> 01:24:20.548]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:24:20.748 --> 01:24:22.469]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:24:22.749 --> 01:24:26.231]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:24:26.432 --> 01:24:33.816]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:24:34.176 --> 01:24:34.797]  Sinofresh.

[01:25:18.289 --> 01:25:20.111]  I was a prisoner of doubt!
[01:25:21.413 --> 01:25:22.214]  Uh, not anymore.
[01:25:25.158 --> 01:25:31.285]  Oh yeah, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio transmission, uh, possible.
[01:25:33.499 --> 01:25:35.661]  This anglophile transmission.
[01:25:35.681 --> 01:25:40.144]  A lot of Brits are British expatriates on the show today.
[01:25:40.164 --> 01:25:49.231]  We're going to be talking to London Guardian reporter and more, Charlie Skelton, here in just a moment.
[01:25:49.251 --> 01:25:51.573]  In fact, I'm looking for my bio.
[01:25:52.393 --> 01:25:54.475]  On Charlie Skelton, because I just... Oh, here it is.
[01:25:54.495 --> 01:25:55.155]  I have it right here.
[01:25:55.696 --> 01:26:00.679]  He's at the Bilderberg Group meeting in Sigis, Spain right now.
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:03.141]  It gets started tomorrow, but they've shut down the hotel today.
[01:26:03.782 --> 01:26:08.065]  We're going to have Jim Tucker on and some other reporters tomorrow as well, and Charlie will be back with us on Friday.
[01:26:08.385 --> 01:26:10.087]  Hopefully he won't get arrested like last time.
[01:26:10.127 --> 01:26:16.071]  I mean, I hope he calls us when we're live if he does get arrested again before Friday, but we hope he doesn't get arrested, period.
[01:26:16.591 --> 01:26:19.754]  So we'll talk to this daring reporter here in just a moment.
[01:26:20.114 --> 01:26:22.996]  Before I go any further, I want to tell you about a coloblue.com.
[01:26:23.396 --> 01:26:26.618]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[01:26:27.678 --> 01:26:29.159]  It's an atmospheric water generator.
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:32.601]  Kind of like Luke Skywalker's moisture evaporators.
[01:26:33.402 --> 01:26:36.483]  And they'll be held to pay if those units aren't fixed in the South Range.
[01:26:37.064 --> 01:26:40.866]  But to be serious, it grabs water directly out of the air.
[01:26:40.886 --> 01:26:42.747]  They have little units that do seven gallons a day.
[01:26:42.787 --> 01:26:44.648]  They have big units that do thousands of gallons a day.
[01:26:45.068 --> 01:26:45.849]  Very affordable.
[01:26:47.824 --> 01:26:51.146]  Looks like a high-tech water cooler without the water bottle on top.
[01:26:51.246 --> 01:26:54.147]  Okolablue.com, the cleanest, best drinking water you can get, period.
[01:26:54.608 --> 01:26:55.208]  Okolablue.com or 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043.
[01:26:55.228 --> 01:26:57.049]  And lastly, I want to tell you about my solar backup.
[01:27:04.813 --> 01:27:07.555]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[01:27:07.595 --> 01:27:14.520]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:14.981]  Here's why.
[01:27:15.001 --> 01:27:18.403]  Plug-and-play solar generators are now available from Solutions from Science.
[01:27:18.744 --> 01:27:25.749]  These portable power systems need no installation and supply household current wherever and whenever you need it, producing electricity directly from the sun.
[01:27:26.089 --> 01:27:29.472]  Unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly and emit no fumes.
[01:27:29.792 --> 01:27:32.454]  It's like having your own electrical power plant, and it's perfect for your home,
[01:27:32.754 --> 01:27:36.957]  or campsite or work bench, out in your shed or garage.
[01:27:37.477 --> 01:27:44.842]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, or you just don't like paying the man money, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:27:45.162 --> 01:27:48.444]  MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365 to get a free information package.
[01:27:48.464 --> 01:27:48.504]  877-327-0365.
[01:27:48.544 --> 01:27:48.604]  OK!
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:58.724]  Now going to Charlie Skelton who got arrested last year.
[01:27:58.784 --> 01:28:02.810]  We were able to actually have him on from the police station when he still had his cell phone.
[01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:08.698]  An Oxford University graduate, journalist for the Evening Standard, The Guardian.
[01:28:08.718 --> 01:28:09.959]  He also writes satire.
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:14.563]  Uh, and has written quite a few books, and we'll give you his website before he, uh, leaves us.
[01:28:14.963 --> 01:28:19.587]  He's on TV shows on Channel 4, Reality TV, uh, and BBC One.
[01:28:20.067 --> 01:28:22.890]  And of course, in 2009, he covered the secret of Bilderberg Group.
[01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:26.592]  He went to basically write satire about it as a joke, but found out it wasn't a joke.
[01:28:26.612 --> 01:28:28.534]  Uh, and he also writes for the London Guardian.
[01:28:28.914 --> 01:28:32.317]  Uh, he joins us now from Spain, outside the...
[01:28:32.677 --> 01:28:36.941]  We spent a couple of nights in the hotel, a little bit cheekily, before lockdown, which took place at noon today.
[01:28:55.269 --> 01:29:15.518]  And, you know, basically all the guests left over the last few days because they had obviously they have the Bilderberg block booking and they're replaced by all the conference organisers who are up to their ears in it and more and more security men who are just piling in at the moment and
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:16.741]  I think so.
[01:29:31.128 --> 01:29:43.236]  Um, you know, there's a small little road that leads up to it, and it's just by the seaside, and, you know, it's a small little sleepy town, and... The supreme leaders up in their citadel, above the rabble scum!
[01:29:44.137 --> 01:29:44.537]  Very much.
[01:29:44.557 --> 01:29:48.460]  That is exactly what is happening, and, you know, and the same...
[01:29:49.614 --> 01:29:57.621]  It's the same dynamic of a very few, I mean more this year, but a few people coming to bear witness to the event.
[01:29:57.902 --> 01:30:06.970]  Pathetic rabble down beneath the walls, with our centurions keeping a close eye on the dangerous scallywags.
[01:30:07.951 --> 01:30:09.132]  There's quite a lot of that actually.
[01:30:09.192 --> 01:30:14.117]  We have a, well we overheard a few conversations and
[01:30:15.514 --> 01:30:18.455]  We have a source in the conference team as well.
[01:30:20.196 --> 01:30:21.056]  Well, that's big news!
[01:30:21.096 --> 01:30:23.337]  You have a source inside the conference team.
[01:30:23.577 --> 01:30:24.857]  You were in there and overheard.
[01:30:24.897 --> 01:30:31.819]  Just like when I was in, I can back this up, when I was in Canada, but really in Virginia, I was in there the day they shut it down.
[01:30:31.859 --> 01:30:33.920]  It kind of stayed until the end until they were trying to throw us out.
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:37.521]  And there were like security teams and I was, you know, catching all of it.
[01:30:37.561 --> 01:30:41.763]  And every spare room and office area was packed full of security people.
[01:30:42.383 --> 01:30:42.663]  Tell us,
[01:30:43.163 --> 01:30:45.305]  As much as you can about the source without revealing them.
[01:30:45.565 --> 01:30:47.266]  And tell us what you overheard, Mr. Skelton.
[01:30:47.587 --> 01:30:48.527]  Well, I can't tell you anything.
[01:30:48.547 --> 01:30:52.591]  I'm not going to tell you anything about the source, but I will tell you some interesting things.
[01:30:52.651 --> 01:31:02.799]  One of them is that there's a no-fly zone for four days over the hotel, and that's being enforced by police helicopters.
[01:31:03.199 --> 01:31:09.384]  And that begins at 8am tomorrow, which is the first official day of the conference.
[01:31:09.404 --> 01:31:11.225]  So, you know, I mean,
[01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:24.761]  We spoke to a barman and we were talking about the cost of this whole thing and he just said, look, you do not want to know how much this is costing.
[01:31:25.281 --> 01:31:31.186]  And, you know, when you think of it, I can't quite get past it in my mind, the sheer cost of this operation, it is huge.
[01:31:31.547 --> 01:31:33.809]  And if anyone thinks that it's not a large event,
[01:31:34.469 --> 01:31:34.689]  It is.
[01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:36.531]  I've never seen anything like it.
[01:31:36.771 --> 01:31:43.156]  And of course the taxpayers pay with our tax money to protect the criminal rulers.
[01:31:43.617 --> 01:31:51.703]  And to be honest, I don't think the Spanish taxpayers are in any position to be paying for this kind of circus right now.
[01:31:51.723 --> 01:31:58.129]  Listen, we're going to know more as the days develop and as you talk to journalists and your source, but what can you tell me about what you overheard?
[01:31:58.189 --> 01:32:00.491]  What can you tell me about what the source told you?
[01:32:01.493 --> 01:32:05.336]  Well, I can confirm some delegates who are coming.
[01:32:06.076 --> 01:32:08.158]  Some of them, they tend to come every year.
[01:32:08.238 --> 01:32:13.762]  There's Richard Holbrooke, Obama's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[01:32:13.802 --> 01:32:14.262]  He'll be there.
[01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:21.788]  General Jack Keane, I think he was in charge of your army at some point.
[01:32:22.395 --> 01:32:22.815]  We're good to go.
[01:32:37.424 --> 01:32:43.725]  It's interesting, the BBC may not be here covering the event live on the ground, but they do have someone inside.
[01:32:44.186 --> 01:32:55.528]  But actually I mustn't badmouth the BBC because they put me on the radio this morning, on BBC Radio 4 Today programme and had a nice chat.
[01:32:57.208 --> 01:33:03.690]  Now you called this a loss of innocence last year because you weren't really expecting to be clapped in irons.
[01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:07.111]  I really wasn't.
[01:33:07.191 --> 01:33:11.292]  I didn't have any idea, to be honest, what was going to happen at all.
[01:33:12.213 --> 01:33:21.976]  To find yourself in a completely dystopian reality with an extraordinary overreaction of
[01:33:23.067 --> 01:33:27.288]  Yeah, let's recap for those that forgot what happened last year to a London Guardian reporter.
[01:33:27.648 --> 01:33:30.569]  You got video of it being followed, harassed, arrested.
[01:33:30.829 --> 01:33:33.429]  There'd be police all around you and you'd say, stop following me.
[01:33:33.469 --> 01:33:35.009]  And they'd say, no one's following you.
[01:33:35.029 --> 01:33:37.250]  And you go to the police station to complain.
[01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:42.171]  And then you see the guys that have been following you there and they say, you're not seeing any of that, sir.
[01:33:42.531 --> 01:33:43.471]  You're quite insane.
[01:33:43.491 --> 01:33:44.771]  And then they finally did arrest you.
[01:33:45.071 --> 01:33:52.773]  So recap that and let's go back to this first look at Bilderberg 2010 and the valuable intel you've already found.
[01:33:54.155 --> 01:33:57.801]  Well, 2009 was, yeah, was my, I suppose, my loss of innocence.
[01:33:59.143 --> 01:34:01.326]  And, yeah, I mean, I sat there in the
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:09.062]  You know in the Athens, I had to run away to Athens because I was being chased around and arrested so much in Budokmanie and I really wasn't trying to do anything at all.
[01:34:09.542 --> 01:34:14.224]  And you know you described me early on as a daring reporter, you know that couldn't be further from the truth.
[01:34:14.524 --> 01:34:23.807]  I spent all of 2009 trying not to get arrested and you know my plan for 2010 is very much along the same lines, not get arrested.
[01:34:24.647 --> 01:34:26.908]  But you know last year I sat in an office in
[01:34:27.928 --> 01:34:39.558]  In Athens opposite, you know, he was probably, I think he was the head of the Athens State Police that look after the Parliament and after their government, so very high up.
[01:34:40.214 --> 01:34:40.655]  I don't think so.
[01:35:03.143 --> 01:35:08.726]  You know, you're going to start seeing ones and zeros, and the matrix will melt away, and you think, you know, whatever.
[01:35:09.146 --> 01:35:10.247]  It's very unsettling.
[01:35:10.367 --> 01:35:11.688]  But that's their psychological.
[01:35:11.728 --> 01:35:18.131]  I mean, they've got Von Rumpy, Brown, all of them announcing world government, run by the bankers that have engineered the financial collapse.
[01:35:18.451 --> 01:35:21.132]  We have their documents from over a decade ago planning this.
[01:35:21.633 --> 01:35:25.755]  And then they'll announce world government and then say, but we're not setting up a world government.
[01:35:26.075 --> 01:35:28.756]  And you're quite insane if you believe in one.
[01:35:29.297 --> 01:35:31.218]  I'm afraid it doesn't exist.
[01:35:31.963 --> 01:35:32.183]  I know.
[01:35:32.403 --> 01:35:33.804]  Look, I mean, I'm sick of it.
[01:35:35.825 --> 01:35:51.313]  I'm sick of ringing up reputable news agencies, and I'm not going to name any names, and speaking to people who work on their foreign news desk, and you say, well, I'm here in Spain covering the Bilderberg conference, and they go, the what?
[01:35:52.091 --> 01:35:54.373]  And you know, I'm thinking, look, this is a big deal.
[01:35:54.413 --> 01:35:55.553]  It really is a big deal.
[01:36:22.291 --> 01:36:23.032]  Go ahead.
[01:36:23.092 --> 01:36:25.814]  Well, I was going to say that, you know, and what... Do you know what?
[01:36:25.874 --> 01:36:38.645]  I don't have a problem with a bunch of financiers and business people getting together to meet up to determine how to fleece, you know, me and whoever, or to sell me whatever mobile phone or anything.
[01:36:38.845 --> 01:36:39.385]  I don't care.
[01:36:39.405 --> 01:36:41.988]  They can strategize to their heart's content.
[01:36:42.028 --> 01:36:50.775]  But, you know, we've got a new coalition in Britain and David Cameron, who's an ex-Bilderberg, and Nick Clegg,
[01:36:51.539 --> 01:36:52.279]  Well, that's like Obama.
[01:36:52.299 --> 01:36:55.320]  He said he's going to be the most transparent, he's more secretive than Bush.
[01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:57.901]  It's always the opposite with these guys when they tell you something.
[01:36:57.921 --> 01:36:58.961]  Yeah, well, do you know what?
[01:36:59.001 --> 01:37:04.803]  It would be nice if, in the spirit of openness and transparency, we simply knew which elected officials went to this four-day
[01:37:26.855 --> 01:37:30.856]  Because they are setting policy in there, and it's against the law in the U.S., the Logan Act.
[01:37:31.376 --> 01:37:34.776]  Did you hear about Daniel Estilin testifying before the European Parliament?
[01:37:34.796 --> 01:37:36.037]  So what's your take on that?
[01:37:50.257 --> 01:37:52.238]  It's not a conspiracy.
[01:37:52.259 --> 01:37:52.879]  It's a meeting.
[01:37:53.239 --> 01:37:53.940]  It's a conference.
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:58.083]  It's a four-day conference.
[01:37:58.103 --> 01:38:01.185]  See, they put that stereotype on it.
[01:38:01.205 --> 01:38:01.945]  They put it on you.
[01:38:01.965 --> 01:38:03.526]  You're like, hey, there's rich elite.
[01:38:03.786 --> 01:38:05.608]  They're robbing us of the banking system.
[01:38:06.268 --> 01:38:07.049]  They're meeting in there.
[01:38:07.089 --> 01:38:10.331]  We've gotten their minutes and they just go, oh, you didn't take your medication.
[01:38:10.651 --> 01:38:11.392]  It's just a way to
[01:38:11.832 --> 01:38:23.962]  Disregard what you're saying and always make debate about whether it exists or not, instead of having a debate about should these private bankers be setting up a global police state to fully extract all our wealth from us?
[01:38:25.524 --> 01:38:26.284]  That's exactly it.
[01:38:26.685 --> 01:38:40.016]  I'm so, I am so sick of every time one mentions any kind of, you know, I don't know what to call it, geomachinations or any kind of global strategy or any, you talk about any kind of large
[01:38:40.966 --> 01:38:43.887]  And that's just a rationalization.
[01:38:43.907 --> 01:38:47.188]  Hitler and Goebbels both said good propaganda is simple and mindless and speaks to people's own laziness.
[01:38:47.228 --> 01:38:48.489]  Well, guess what, folks?
[01:38:48.529 --> 01:38:49.729]  The banks are imploding the economy.
[01:38:49.749 --> 01:38:53.070]  They are setting up a world government.
[01:39:06.175 --> 01:39:13.460]  You can read Charlie Skelton's great columns at the London Guardian while he's there reporting, and we'll put that up on screen on TV for folks.
[01:39:13.741 --> 01:39:14.981]  You can also go to his website.
[01:39:15.142 --> 01:39:20.846]  Tell us the best ways to read your reportage while you're there in Spain covering our owners.
[01:39:23.107 --> 01:39:25.349]  Well, go to the Guardian website.
[01:39:25.469 --> 01:39:31.033]  If you just go to guardian.co.uk, you will, I'm sure, find me somewhere.
[01:39:31.093 --> 01:39:32.314]  Put in the word Bilderberg.
[01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:35.032]  Yeah, Charlie Skelton, Bilderberg, it's all over the place.
[01:39:36.073 --> 01:39:41.137]  Now, expanding on this, because I segwayed into what happened to you last year, what type of security are you seeing?
[01:39:41.177 --> 01:39:45.000]  What's some of the other intel you picked up from inside the club Bilderberg?
[01:39:45.881 --> 01:39:50.085]  Well, in terms of just the security, it's the same thing.
[01:39:50.105 --> 01:39:52.387]  It's absolutely immense.
[01:39:52.667 --> 01:39:56.250]  There are just dozens and dozens of
[01:39:57.088 --> 01:40:01.389]  Police cars, there are dozens and dozens of riot police vans.
[01:40:01.469 --> 01:40:10.671]  I mean, they are kitting themselves up as if they're about to be attacked by, you know, 100,000 heavily armed troops.
[01:40:11.011 --> 01:40:24.774]  Whereas, in fact, there are, you know, there's maybe two dozen, you know, very nice, kind people sitting outside who are a little bit clued up, who are sitting outside this police cordon just saying, you know,
[01:40:25.572 --> 01:40:29.533]  I'm not quite sure that what is going on up the hill is exactly right.
[01:40:29.753 --> 01:40:37.475]  I'm not quite sure the people up there are strategizing in my interests, or in fact in the interests of the majority of human beings on the planet.
[01:40:38.256 --> 01:40:42.697]  And, you know, they're there and they're saying their little thing and they're holding their signs.
[01:40:43.197 --> 01:40:47.118]  And, you know, a few meters away are people that
[01:40:55.078 --> 01:40:55.820]  I mean, seriously.
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:58.864]  I mean, who were they expecting to come running up that hill?
[01:40:59.605 --> 01:41:21.249]  Well, they know they're identified, and they know we're looking at them, and they can't be happy that ten years ago you'd see no news about Bilderberg, now you Google the term, there are hundreds of articles a day in prestigious publications admitting Queen of the Netherlands, Prince of Holland, representatives of the British Royalty, the Spanish Royalty, they're all there, and people are going, wow, there really is an elite!
[01:41:21.689 --> 01:41:25.350]  And how dumb we were to be told no children, you know,
[01:41:26.210 --> 01:41:26.671]  Yeah.
[01:41:26.771 --> 01:41:28.493]  They don't love us.
[01:41:28.893 --> 01:41:32.518]  You know, they don't love us, they barely hate us.
[01:41:32.538 --> 01:41:34.140]  I think they just treat us as ones and zeros.
[01:41:46.516 --> 01:41:48.477]  Now this source in the hotel, what are they saying?
[01:41:48.497 --> 01:41:52.040]  They're going to help you get info throughout the conference?
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:53.701]  No, I think that's closed up.
[01:41:53.881 --> 01:41:56.382]  It was purely while we were there in contact.
[01:41:57.403 --> 01:42:00.045]  You know, I mean, you've got to understand that the people running the conference
[01:42:01.129 --> 01:42:02.209]  They're all kinds of different people.
[01:42:02.249 --> 01:42:05.310]  You know, there are people who are just simply there to put up the lighting rigs.
[01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:09.431]  There are people there simply, you know, moving in crates of watermelons.
[01:42:09.751 --> 01:42:11.092]  You know, there's lots of people.
[01:42:11.172 --> 01:42:12.372]  It requires a lot of manpower.
[01:42:12.472 --> 01:42:15.413]  I mean, there's the maids, there's the security people, there's the police.
[01:42:15.793 --> 01:42:20.674]  But larger than that, and I'm not telling you what to do, but I always tell Tucker this, I tell all of them this.
[01:42:22.235 --> 01:42:25.939]  Because it seems 101 to me, but then I'm always in a hurry to get back to it, and I don't do it.
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:36.990]  I need to go to Bilderberg three or four days before, be there during it, covering it when I'm kicked out, and then the real intel is after they leave, going back in and taking your time.
[01:42:38.091 --> 01:42:43.933]  Interviewing all the insiders and beforehand getting them to dig stuff out of the trash for you, like Jim Tucker does.
[01:42:43.953 --> 01:42:51.596]  But final segment, give us a bird's eye view, kind of a preview of the info you're going to be giving us on Friday when you join us.
[01:42:51.656 --> 01:42:57.298]  Charlie Skelton, London Guardian reporter, reporting from Bilderberg in Spain 2010.
[01:42:57.999 --> 01:43:01.740]  And we got Tucker and others joining us tomorrow.
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:03.361]  This is going to be extremely informative.
[01:43:03.381 --> 01:43:03.761]  Stay with us.
[01:43:06.243 --> 01:43:07.605]  Don't answer it!

[01:43:24.025 --> 01:43:28.088]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[01:43:59.251 --> 01:44:00.813]  They helped to create a new world order.
[01:44:00.833 --> 01:44:01.974]  We are part of a new world order.
[01:44:01.994 --> 01:44:03.595]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[01:44:13.044 --> 01:44:17.787]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:44:18.147 --> 01:44:22.349]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:24.991]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:44:25.011 --> 01:44:27.532]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:44:27.552 --> 01:44:30.454]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:44:30.794 --> 01:44:38.398]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:44:38.738 --> 01:44:44.001]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:44:44.121 --> 01:44:46.403]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:44:46.443 --> 01:44:50.425]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:44:50.665 --> 01:44:51.566]  And I got news for you.
[01:44:51.746 --> 01:44:53.067]  You're everyone else.
[01:44:53.087 --> 01:44:54.127]  Invisible Empire.

[01:45:11.719 --> 01:45:15.180]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[01:46:08.027 --> 01:46:14.537]  It's the Dulce Sigis Luxury Armored Resort in Sigis, Spain.
[01:46:14.557 --> 01:46:22.929]  We've got shots from the hotel website up on screen where this group of scallywags is meeting.
[01:46:23.269 --> 01:46:26.250]  A bunch of eugenicists who believe the earth belongs to them.
[01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:27.330]  They've already got all the wealth.
[01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.911]  They stole it.
[01:46:28.191 --> 01:46:29.291]  Now they want you out of here.
[01:46:29.311 --> 01:46:35.293]  They're building their extermination grid to get rid of all the feral humans right now, and they're teaching you how to love your enslavement.
[01:46:35.733 --> 01:46:38.294]  We're going back to Charlie Skelton here in just a moment.
[01:46:38.554 --> 01:46:45.297]  Our continued Bilderberg coverage, at least one hour today, throughout the rest of the week, and then a little bit into next week with the aftermath of it.
[01:46:45.637 --> 01:46:48.478]  Always key intel gleaned and garnered.
[01:46:49.622 --> 01:46:56.786]  During this time, other key articles that are up on the network website, GCN, that's G-C-N, live.com.
[01:46:57.686 --> 01:47:01.268]  Iran to dump 45 billion euros for gold bullion and dollars.
[01:47:02.169 --> 01:47:05.991]  Al-Qaeda number three killed again, this by Steve Watson, very important article.
[01:47:06.171 --> 01:47:09.993]  They just kill these guys over and over again, never retract the last time they kill them.
[01:47:10.814 --> 01:47:11.094]  U.S.
[01:47:11.234 --> 01:47:14.796]  Mint sells more gold coins in May than any month since January 99.
[01:47:17.037 --> 01:47:19.219]  Put patients and doctors back in control of health care.

[01:47:25.324 --> 01:47:26.004]  London Times.
[01:47:26.865 --> 01:47:27.926]  We've got Ray McGovern.
[01:47:27.986 --> 01:47:30.047]  Obama's timidity and death at sea.
[01:47:30.087 --> 01:47:33.530]  Dealing with his perspective on the Israel boarding situation.
[01:47:34.291 --> 01:47:35.572]  That's all up at GCN Live.
[01:47:36.212 --> 01:47:37.473]  Absolutely, yeah.
[01:47:37.493 --> 01:47:39.555]  I mean, I really hope that's not the case, but yeah, of course.
[01:47:57.532 --> 01:48:05.314]  Well, I mean, I got arrested just flying into Canada and they screamed and yelled at me and said, you're here for the conference, you bleeping piece of filth, you American garbage!
[01:48:05.954 --> 01:48:07.775]  So, I mean, they do this to basically everybody.
[01:48:08.935 --> 01:48:16.237]  But in the last three or four minutes we've got left, other key tidbits of data that you got while you were inside the resort before they threw you out?
[01:48:17.097 --> 01:48:20.738]  Well, you know, I've got a few things, but I just wanted to say that
[01:48:21.768 --> 01:48:35.475]  You know, my role here is not, I don't really see myself as trying to, you know, get that intel and to, you know, I do have some stuff which I'll, you know, I'm holding a little bit back, to be quite honest with you, to write about in The Guardian.
[01:48:37.757 --> 01:48:39.037]  That's terrible, isn't it?
[01:48:39.077 --> 01:48:39.618]  No, it's not.
[01:48:40.118 --> 01:48:42.899]  We'll get full details in The Guardian, but tell us more.
[01:48:42.919 --> 01:48:44.600]  I mean, tell us some of what you've picked up.
[01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:45.821]  Well, you know what?
[01:48:46.573 --> 01:49:09.237]  I'd like to just talk about what I've picked up from putting together, I've been trying to sort of put together a little bit of a kind of, I guess you'd call it a press campaign for Bilderberg 2010, and you know I put together a website called Trilever.com, T-R-I-L-E-V-E-R dot com, and you know we've done and putting up press releases there, as it were almost on behalf of Bilderberg.
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:16.258]  I've been ringing up the good news agencies and I rang up the, you'll enjoy this one, I rang up BBC
[01:49:17.749 --> 01:49:20.551]  Uh, Foreign News Desk, if it was, for the TV.
[01:49:20.611 --> 01:49:25.494]  And, you know, and I preface this by saying I've had a lot of good experience with the BBC over the last few days.
[01:49:25.594 --> 01:49:28.936]  And, you know, I'm due to do an interview.
[01:49:28.976 --> 01:49:32.959]  So you're trying to get the mainstream media, you're trying to get the mainstream media to report on this.
[01:49:33.239 --> 01:49:33.720]  Exactly.
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:34.520]  That's my role here.
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:36.141]  I really do see that as what I'm trying to do.
[01:49:36.681 --> 01:49:42.705]  And I rang up the BBC Foreign News Desk at their TV news section and
[01:49:44.524 --> 01:49:48.427]  You know, I'm negotiating with him about the story, about what they might do with it.
[01:49:48.927 --> 01:49:51.568]  And, you know, I'm feeding them ideas for stories.
[01:49:51.628 --> 01:49:56.852]  I ring back the next day and the guy goes, oh yeah, Bilderberg's been taken off our diary.
[01:49:57.512 --> 01:49:58.433]  And I said, sorry, what?
[01:49:58.833 --> 01:50:00.574]  He said, yeah, look, it wasn't my decision.
[01:50:01.054 --> 01:50:02.215]  He sounded quite shifty.
[01:50:02.555 --> 01:50:03.596]  Can you tell us his name?
[01:50:03.616 --> 01:50:07.758]  Because that's big news that BBC was hot on this and then the story got killed.
[01:50:08.078 --> 01:50:08.439]  Do you know what?
[01:50:08.819 --> 01:50:09.780]  I can't remember his name.
[01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:11.300]  I've written it down, though, somewhere.
[01:50:11.421 --> 01:50:13.682]  Was this with BBC TV or BBC Radio?
[01:50:13.962 --> 01:50:17.585]  I think it was BBC TV News.
[01:50:18.707 --> 01:50:19.808]  It's been taken off the diary.
[01:50:19.988 --> 01:50:21.309]  And he said it wasn't my decision.
[01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:22.870]  We're almost out of time.
[01:50:22.890 --> 01:50:23.871]  We'll talk to you again Friday.
[01:50:23.891 --> 01:50:27.515]  But any other key info that we're going to be looking for in the Guardian in more detail?
[01:50:28.275 --> 01:50:30.558]  I'm just going to be rambling on as usual.
[01:50:33.211 --> 01:50:35.452]  Alright, well, Mr. Skelton, we're out of time.
[01:50:35.492 --> 01:50:36.793]  We're glad you're there.
[01:50:37.153 --> 01:50:40.435]  We'll check in with you again tomorrow if anything breaks, but for sure on Friday.
[01:50:40.715 --> 01:50:41.416]  Thank you so much.
