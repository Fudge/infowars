[00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:17.295]  Alright, in about three minutes we're going to Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.com.
[00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:20.918]  Of course he worked for the National Security Agency, for the Navy and Security.
[00:00:21.798 --> 00:00:30.925]  He's written for some of the biggest publications in the country and we're honored to have him joining us because he's got a lot of intel on plans for evacuations in the Gulf.
[00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:41.292]  We now see Council on Foreign Relations members and others who are in the news, like the Washington Post, saying that they may
[00:00:42.193 --> 00:00:45.494]  Have an evacuation of 20 million people when that oil comes ashore.
[00:00:45.534 --> 00:00:58.699]  But I wanted to finish up with Brandon and Kurt, both in the military, and then we'll continue into the next hour discussing this headline, New York National Guard units scan vehicles for gun confiscation.
[00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:05.301]  So now they're in Illinois, California, you name it, engaging in gun confiscation.
[00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:09.142]  Yes Alex, thank you for having me on and thank you for what you do.
[00:01:23.522 --> 00:01:25.443]  I'm going to talk real quick, because I know you don't have much time.
[00:01:25.903 --> 00:01:27.043]  I was stationed in San Diego.
[00:01:27.543 --> 00:01:29.044]  I've purchased all your DVDs.
[00:01:29.324 --> 00:01:33.085]  I've showed my command, like a lot of people at my command that I work with.
[00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:34.946]  I've woken a lot of people up.
[00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:36.946]  My apartment complex there, I've woken a lot of people up.
[00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:38.147]  Now I'm stationed in Virginia.
[00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:40.687]  I've woke up my whole entire street.
[00:01:41.348 --> 00:01:43.508]  And even my cable man, I mentioned something.
[00:01:43.528 --> 00:01:45.829]  I just got home, he was hooking this stuff up.
[00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:46.809]  I had my uniform on.
[00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.391]  He said, thank you, thank you so much for you and your stature, because I was wearing my uniform.
[00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:05.572]  Well, that's their rationalization to not defend America, but it's now admitted world governments here.
[00:02:05.612 --> 00:02:10.373]  It's now admitted a private banking takeover is happening, and they're creating a new global currency.
[00:02:10.893 --> 00:02:13.514]  But you are saying you have had a good response?
[00:02:13.554 --> 00:02:16.995]  What percentage of people were favorable on the military base?
[00:02:18.246 --> 00:02:20.266]  Actually, I got about eight out of ten.
[00:02:20.447 --> 00:02:28.328]  Actually, one of my current co-workers actually called me a terrorist himself, and I was like, you don't even get it, but I had help from the other co-workers.
[00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:34.230]  So you're a terrorist because you believe that there's corrupt elements in the government that are taking our freedom?
[00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.751]  I mean, as a member of the military, you're supposed to defend the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, and you're supposed to follow the Constitution.
[00:02:42.592 --> 00:02:43.132]  Yep, yep.
[00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:46.017]  Quick, two quick more things.
[00:02:46.537 --> 00:02:54.180]  That cable guy is actually going to come by this week and burn a couple of your discs, copy a couple of your videos so we can show it to his family.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.882]  And the last one, I'm part of the oil response team and we're gearing up.
[00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:05.685]  We're leaving next week to the Gulf and a couple of other guys are leaving in a couple of weeks to the Gulf.
[00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:09.206]  They said they're going to issue us desert
[00:03:09.702 --> 00:03:11.524]  Uniforms, desert camo uniforms.
[00:03:12.585 --> 00:03:14.666]  That's kind of dumb since we all have uniforms.
[00:03:15.247 --> 00:03:16.488]  For some reason they're going to do that.
[00:03:16.888 --> 00:03:19.551]  I asked about respirators and they said there was no need.
[00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:24.535]  So, I'm going to finish up with this.
[00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:28.238]  Not only does the government have boots on the ground, but you've got boots on the ground too, Alex.
[00:03:28.298 --> 00:03:30.460]  And I'll definitely keep you guys informed and updated.
[00:03:30.954 --> 00:03:31.575]  Absolutely.
[00:03:31.955 --> 00:03:34.196]  Wonderful information, Brandon.
[00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:35.597]  I mean, very powerful information.
[00:03:35.957 --> 00:03:43.863]  We have so many military people calling us, and snipers, intelligence officers, engineers, which makes sense.
[00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:45.264]  Engineers being sent to the Gulf.
[00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:46.364]  Regular Army.
[00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:49.707]  And they're now talking about possible evacuation.
[00:03:49.727 --> 00:03:53.549]  We'll be talking to Wayne Madsen here in just a moment about that.
[00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.091]  But yeah, they're on record.
[00:03:56.151 --> 00:03:58.713]  BP is on record saying no respirators are needed.
[00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:00.414]  There's no toxic fumes.
[00:04:01.314 --> 00:04:04.296]  Because if they admit there's toxic fumes, they would then be liable.
[00:04:04.697 --> 00:04:06.318]  Everyone knows there's toxic fumes.
[00:04:06.338 --> 00:04:15.564]  The average life expectancy of Exxon Valdez workers of 51 years, the government admits that, from the dioxin and toxins and benzene in the oil and the dispersants,
[00:04:16.224 --> 00:04:22.908]  And so a lot of these people have already died or they're in the hospital and that's why they're saying nobody can videotape, nobody can talk to these workers.
[00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:26.810]  They send them to BP hospitals, BP clinics.
[00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:29.752]  I mean, this is one hell of a cover-up.
[00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:33.615]  We're going to Wayne Madsen to get his inside scoop on that in just a moment.
[00:04:33.655 --> 00:04:35.316]  Finishing up with Kurt and we're going right to Wayne.
[00:04:35.596 --> 00:04:37.557]  Kurt in Deutschland, who's in the Army.
[00:04:37.637 --> 00:04:38.257]  Welcome, Kurt.
[00:04:39.358 --> 00:04:39.798]  Hello, sir.
[00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:40.699]  Hello, go ahead.
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.642]  Real quick, I just wanted to tell you, with all the chemicals you talk about on your show,
[00:04:46.374 --> 00:04:55.927]  I do a lot of research on them and one of the things I've been using to sort of open people's eyes a little bit when they don't believe me is the material safety data sheets.
[00:04:57.086 --> 00:05:02.211]  All these chemicals, any chemical made has material safety data sheets made by the companies that make them.
[00:05:02.612 --> 00:05:03.473]  Oh, that's a great point.
[00:05:03.493 --> 00:05:08.117]  So for sodium fluoride, you show them the skull and crossbones, the organ failure, the sterilization.
[00:05:08.698 --> 00:05:10.680]  For the silicone, they put in chicken McNuggets.
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.823]  You can show them the data sheet on that, how deadly it is.
[00:05:14.504 --> 00:05:19.169]  For all these chemicals they put in our food and water, you can show them the documents.
[00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:20.150]  That's a great way to do it.
[00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:27.226]  Yeah, and I think the funniest thing is the reaction you get, because first they start laughing when you start telling them, yeah, sodium fluoride's poisonous.
[00:05:27.646 --> 00:05:31.810]  They're laughing, so I come back with the material safety data sheet and put it on the table, like, it's poisonous.
[00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.051]  There you go.
[00:05:34.071 --> 00:05:39.856]  But, uh, and I just wanted to say, uh, there is a lot of people waking up in the military.
[00:05:39.916 --> 00:05:40.497]  I'm in the army.
[00:05:40.537 --> 00:05:42.158]  I'm stationed in, uh, Illesheim, Germany.
[00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:47.142]  And, uh, I have the show on while I'm at work, and I talk to a lot of people about it.
[00:05:47.743 --> 00:05:50.065]  And everybody I talk to says that they're not going to
[00:05:51.328 --> 00:05:55.394]  They're not going to take guns from American citizens, from unarmed civilians.
[00:05:55.454 --> 00:05:56.316]  It's just not going to happen.
[00:05:57.995 --> 00:06:02.319]  Well, I know most of the military and police I talk to say that.
[00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:05.221]  The problem is we saw what happened in Katrina.
[00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:07.103]  Most of them did follow the orders.
[00:06:07.183 --> 00:06:11.787]  So, individually they're saying no, but in that group think they're following orders.
[00:06:11.827 --> 00:06:14.369]  That's why we need to have this debate and discussion now.
[00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:23.056]  But what do you think about this huge, long-term, covert operation to acclimate not just the troops and the police, but the public as well to accept this?
[00:06:23.096 --> 00:06:23.917]  I mean, this is 23 years old.
[00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:27.260]  I mean, that's how far back we can prove it.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.484]  A huge, covert gun confiscation preparation program.
[00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:32.545]  I mean, that's creepy.
[00:06:32.565 --> 00:06:37.649]  I just don't understand how people... I mean, it's going on all around you.
[00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:39.691]  I try to tell people that, just look around you.
[00:06:39.731 --> 00:06:45.016]  When I'm talking to people, when I call the states back home, I'm trying to tell them, like, if you don't believe me, just look around you.
[00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:45.637]  Read the news.
[00:06:45.657 --> 00:06:47.018]  Like, read anything.
[00:06:47.118 --> 00:06:48.980]  How can you not see this happening right in front of you?
[00:06:49.656 --> 00:06:50.477]  God bless you, Kurt.
[00:06:50.497 --> 00:06:51.077]  Good to hear from you.
[00:06:51.117 --> 00:06:51.798]  Here's an example.
[00:06:51.818 --> 00:07:06.508]  I was driving to my parents this weekend with my children and I was on 360 and I looked over at the fire department and I saw military uniforms with police and with... No, no, no.
[00:07:06.728 --> 00:07:09.450]  That was about a month ago that I saw the military and the police.
[00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.112]  This was out by Lake Travis this weekend.
[00:07:12.212 --> 00:07:12.632]  I saw the
[00:07:14.881 --> 00:07:16.302]  Again, I'm just having a flashback to this.
[00:07:16.422 --> 00:07:26.209]  I saw the fire department, military, and police all running around doing some hazmat drill, and I didn't have time to pull over and even look at it because I had that limited time with my family.
[00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:29.211]  But that's just an example how it's just going on everywhere.
[00:07:29.471 --> 00:07:32.493]  And it seems reasonable to have the military training with police.
[00:07:32.853 --> 00:07:35.795]  But then they always have it first, oh, we're doing hazmat drills.
[00:07:36.115 --> 00:07:38.317]  And then next, we're going to help you get the guns.
[00:07:38.817 --> 00:07:44.201]  And by the way, I have from 1998 the internal army documents from Fort Hood.
[00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:52.648]  Uh, that are in my film, Police State 2 The Takeover, where they admit we are here for bomb disposal and for anti-firearms operations.
[00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:55.471]  So this has been going on quietly in the background.
[00:07:55.871 --> 00:08:05.180]  Now it's coming to the fore, because they know it's almost impossible to defeat something that slowly infiltrates, that slowly takes over.
[00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:07.382]  All right, Wayne Madsen.
[00:08:08.348 --> 00:08:10.269]  of Wayne Madsen Report is our guest.
[00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:20.156]  Wayne's always given us really good intel, and we just heard a military man say that he's being deployed from Virginia, regular Army, down to the Gulf.
[00:08:20.857 --> 00:08:23.999]  And we now see the Washington Post talking about 20 million evacuated.
[00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:29.163]  Wayne Madsen, from your intelligence agency sources in D.C.
[00:08:29.203 --> 00:08:32.345]  and from your sources there at the Press Club, what's the inside scoop?
[00:08:33.248 --> 00:08:38.572]  Well, I reported back in May that there were plans to evacuate millions of people.
[00:08:39.152 --> 00:08:43.595]  The first people to be evacuated would be those who have respiratory problems.
[00:08:43.695 --> 00:08:59.666]  I know several who are now seeing BP doctors who are saying there's a number of people coming into these BP medical facilities complaining of respiratory ailments and some have been diagnosed with what's known as chemical pneumonia.
[00:09:00.386 --> 00:09:09.392]  I know one person who actually has been diagnosed with that by BP and now people's pets are beginning to suffer from the same ailment.
[00:09:09.512 --> 00:09:14.795]  So we have basically BP engaged in a huge PR operation.
[00:09:14.815 --> 00:09:26.503]  They've hired every big time PR firm here in Washington and I'm surprised that the Washington Post is even hinting at evacuation because one of the problems we're seeing with the press
[00:09:27.403 --> 00:09:40.551]  Is that their editors are contacting their legal department because these companies that own the media may have vested interests with BP or Halliburton or these other companies involved in this oil disaster.
[00:09:41.051 --> 00:09:42.672]  And I think that's a problem.
[00:09:42.692 --> 00:09:45.434]  And that's why next week I'm going to the Gulf because
[00:09:46.354 --> 00:09:48.776]  I want to see for myself what's going on down there.
[00:09:49.136 --> 00:09:53.478]  There's been reports of journalists and photojournalists being arrested.
[00:09:54.379 --> 00:09:55.459]  So I'm going down there.
[00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:57.840]  I'll be in Plaquemine Parish.
[00:09:58.841 --> 00:10:08.786]  I'll go over to Alabama, Mississippi, and Pensacola Beach to see firsthand what's going on, and I will document with photos and interviews and whatnot what I find out.
[00:10:10.367 --> 00:10:13.569]  Wayne, expanding on that, because you did
[00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:15.341]  Over a month
[00:10:45.782 --> 00:10:46.463]  We're good.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.581]  It'll be 80 days tomorrow.
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.582]  Well, I have a story up today.
[00:11:33.602 --> 00:11:39.867]  The company that was hired by BP to do the third party, what's called mud logging.
[00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:46.853]  This is where they analyze all the sediment and rock material incrementally coming up.
[00:11:46.913 --> 00:11:48.014]  And this was the deepest
[00:11:49.568 --> 00:11:50.269]  We're good to go.
[00:12:06.708 --> 00:12:11.129]  And I think it was a political decision to keep drilling.
[00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.831]  The Schlumberger engineers said, look, this thing is getting ready to go.
[00:12:16.231 --> 00:12:27.274]  There's an internal Schlumberger document that shows that their crew was out there and left that platform, the Deepwater Horizon, a little after 9 o'clock in the morning.
[00:12:27.334 --> 00:12:32.396]  And that, of course, the explosion was later on that evening.
[00:12:32.516 --> 00:12:35.957]  So we know this from documented evidence that
[00:12:36.357 --> 00:12:43.333]  Well, yeah, we have the Coast Guard report, but I mean, we even see conflicting how it was a 30,000 foot well, or it was 18,000 feet well.
[00:12:43.373 --> 00:12:45.237]  We've seen a lot of different conflicting information.
[00:12:45.871 --> 00:12:48.132]  Well, you know, it's odd.
[00:12:48.252 --> 00:12:53.535]  One of the sources that I'm getting is from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
[00:12:53.575 --> 00:13:05.461]  Whoever thought after what they did with Katrina that they would be, you know, revealing inside information, but they have been bypassed by the Coast Guard and BP.
[00:13:05.541 --> 00:13:12.044]  FEMA, you know, the rice bowl protectors, they are part of the Department of Homeland Security, but there are many people there who are
[00:13:12.504 --> 00:13:25.848]  I mean where does BP get the authority to tell reporters they can't videotape and now we have the Coast Guard saying federal felonies if you even try to videotape.
[00:13:25.868 --> 00:13:27.648]  So they are acting very suspicious.
[00:13:41.525 --> 00:13:44.006]  Oh yeah, well, the authority comes from President Obama.
[00:13:44.086 --> 00:13:50.730]  I mean, he put this guy, Thad Allen, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, in charge as the National Incident Commander.
[00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.531]  His relationship with BP is very close.
[00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:59.634]  I heard a rumor that even before the disaster, he was going to get a job with BP after he retired.
[00:13:59.694 --> 00:14:04.877]  Now, he's still, you know, he's Obama's Brownie, except I think he's more insidious.
[00:14:04.917 --> 00:14:06.518]  Brownie was a total incompetent.
[00:14:07.078 --> 00:14:09.801]  Pat Allen knows exactly what he's doing by showing for BP.
[00:14:09.841 --> 00:14:29.578]  He's trying to limit their exposure and basically his Coast Guard personnel and BP's hired security people, which a lot of them are Wackenhut, and I also reported that some of the people chasing people away from the beaches are off-duty Alabama troopers in that state.
[00:14:29.998 --> 00:14:38.042]  So we have, basically BP is running the show, and I think this can be laid right to the doorstep of the White House.
[00:14:39.203 --> 00:14:45.366]  The media, I had a report up yesterday that in the Pensacola area, Mediacom, the
[00:14:45.766 --> 00:14:58.398]  Cable provider has blocked out the 5-530 local newscasts of the ABC and CBS affiliate because they're doing a lot of in-depth reporting and also blocking out the 6 p.m.
[00:14:58.478 --> 00:15:03.403]  national CBS and ABC news reports from the people in Pensacola.
[00:15:03.443 --> 00:15:09.669]  People are getting a black screen when they try to tune into the local affiliates and the national networks.
[00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:18.454]  And I think this goes to show the extent of the censorship going on as far as this disaster.
[00:15:18.654 --> 00:15:20.655]  Wayne Madsen, I think they have a name for this.
[00:15:20.675 --> 00:15:24.076]  This is called martial law, full spectrum dominance.
[00:15:24.596 --> 00:15:27.978]  And to have CNN reporting the First Amendment is now dead in the Gulf.
[00:15:28.718 --> 00:15:36.028]  And to have BP up to 10 miles in having police arresting reporters that just ask questions, that's been on the news.
[00:15:36.048 --> 00:15:39.012]  I mean, this is martial law in America.
[00:15:39.653 --> 00:15:43.518]  And the big issue here is what happens when that
[00:15:45.124 --> 00:15:52.407]  150 million plus gallons of oil now being driven towards the shore by the tropical storms forming in the Gulf.
[00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:54.667]  What happens when a lot of that comes ashore?
[00:15:54.727 --> 00:15:56.448]  We know there's already respiratory problems.
[00:15:56.808 --> 00:16:05.291]  We know 51 is the average life expectancy for Exxon Valdez workers from the off-gassing and toxins.
[00:16:05.651 --> 00:16:08.572]  We know the dispersants are much worse than the oil itself.
[00:16:09.232 --> 00:16:14.718]  We know they're so deadly they even eat the hulls of boats, and BP isn't allowing their workers to wear respirators.
[00:16:15.218 --> 00:16:17.581]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:16:18.368 --> 00:16:19.149]  Well, it is.
[00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:19.589]  Absolutely.
[00:16:19.669 --> 00:16:27.578]  It's probably the worst, in many respects, because it's more widespread than Katrina.
[00:16:27.598 --> 00:16:31.102]  It's affecting now every Gulf state, of course.
[00:16:31.202 --> 00:16:38.790]  And every time there's a tar ball or a tar paddy, whatever they call these things that wash up, the initial response is, well, it's from a passing ship.
[00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.952]  We've seen this time and time again with the
[00:16:41.052 --> 00:16:56.245]  Florida Keys, the Dry Tortugas, now the Texas Beaches, and this is all part of an information... a Pentagon-grade influence operation, information warfare, if you will, to limit the news that's coming out of the Gulf.
[00:16:56.365 --> 00:17:02.310]  And, you know, it's just a shame that there's not more national media descending on the Gulf.
[00:17:03.071 --> 00:17:04.532]  I'm going to do it next week.
[00:17:04.812 --> 00:17:06.354]  I don't care if they arrest me or not.
[00:17:07.414 --> 00:17:09.335]  You know, we've got the First Amendment.
[00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:14.657]  I haven't heard that Mr. Obama has abrogated it yet, but he doesn't have the authority to do that.
[00:17:14.697 --> 00:17:21.320]  Well, they're saying in the Associated Press and the San Francisco Chronicle that it's a federal felony.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.226]  Punishable by a decade in jail if you videotape any of their operations or try to talk to anyone.
[00:17:28.887 --> 00:17:32.150]  And so this is the new Gulag, and where'd Wayne Madsen go?
[00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:36.054]  Well, he tried to be a reporter, and you don't do that in the new Soviet America.
[00:17:36.534 --> 00:17:44.862]  I want to talk to you about your sources, your take on what's going to happen when that oil starts really coming ashore, because we've only seen the tip of the iceberg.
[00:17:44.882 --> 00:17:45.983]  And speaking of PSYOPs,
[00:17:46.644 --> 00:17:58.679]  The way the media's spinning it that we've got to buy BP shares, we've got to shop at BP and buy their gas, or they'll go bankrupt and can't pay for the emergency, and that Obama is against BP when they bankrolled him.
[00:18:00.141 --> 00:18:03.345]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[00:18:03.886 --> 00:18:04.386]  Think again.
[00:18:05.183 --> 00:18:12.672]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[00:18:12.852 --> 00:18:19.840]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:25.426]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers.

[00:18:59.321 --> 00:19:00.581]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:19:00.641 --> 00:19:05.983]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:19:06.223 --> 00:19:10.844]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:19:11.244 --> 00:19:16.306]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:19:16.806 --> 00:19:21.487]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:19:22.025 --> 00:19:28.947]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[00:19:29.147 --> 00:19:30.048]  And here's the best part.
[00:19:30.268 --> 00:19:33.029]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:19:33.329 --> 00:19:36.630]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.791]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:19:40.131 --> 00:19:43.212]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:19:43.232 --> 00:19:43.432]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:19:43.452 --> 00:19:43.732]  Remember,
[00:19:52.082 --> 00:19:55.674]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:58.384]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:19:59.344 --> 00:20:07.271]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.

[00:20:56.085 --> 00:20:57.827]  Working with the power of nature.
[00:21:04.073 --> 00:21:13.201]  We're going back to Wayne Madsen for the balance of this segment and the next, and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us to talk about the economy, the situation with Iran, and a lot more.
[00:21:13.221 --> 00:21:16.264]  Of course, he's the father of Reaganomics, former Wall Street Journal editor.
[00:21:16.464 --> 00:21:19.126]  Before we go back to Wayne Madsen for the balance of this segment and the next,
[00:21:19.927 --> 00:21:28.938]  I wanted to remind listeners that we have an online video bookstore with the best books, most informative films, to further educate yourself and to educate others.
[00:21:29.078 --> 00:21:31.421]  And now, people are really ready to be awakened.
[00:21:31.441 --> 00:21:38.108]  Whether it's Invisible Empire, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, that documents all the FEMA camps and the gun confiscation plans.
[00:21:39.261 --> 00:21:42.762]  How America is being slowly integrated into this police state system.
[00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:45.182]  It's all available at InfoWars.com.
[00:21:45.202 --> 00:21:50.483]  We're offering a new video, The Secret of Oz, by the great filmmaker Bill Still, who made The Money Masters.
[00:21:51.003 --> 00:22:02.345]  It's been a decade plus since he's made a new film, and you can get The Secret of Oz discounted with The Money Masters as well if you want to get the combo or get it individually at InfoWars.com.
[00:22:02.385 --> 00:22:05.026]  And we have a new special where you get two t-shirts

[00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:24.781]  That's all available at Infowars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:29.625 --> 00:22:32.587]  Okay, and your purchases also make this broadcast possible.
[00:22:32.847 --> 00:22:35.248]  Going back to Wayne Madsen, thewaynemadsenreport.com.
[00:22:35.468 --> 00:22:54.097]  Okay, Wayne, specifically, what's the word on what they're planning to do when the oil starts coming ashore, A, and B, why would Obama block the counties and states from protecting themselves with berms and jetties?
[00:22:55.251 --> 00:23:10.984]  Well, I think what's going to happen if we start seeing these tropical storms, hurricanes, picking up this toxic soup in the Gulf and dumping it far inland, we're going to see the poisoning of the freshwater supplies inland.
[00:23:11.004 --> 00:23:15.348]  The streams, the creeks, the reservoirs, the lakes, etc.
[00:23:15.808 --> 00:23:18.571]  And that's going to extend this disaster even further.
[00:23:19.111 --> 00:23:24.172]  As far as Obama, I think Obama is not acting as President of the United States.
[00:23:24.232 --> 00:23:26.613]  He's taking his orders from BP.
[00:23:26.913 --> 00:23:29.094]  And we had the Queen of England here.
[00:23:29.534 --> 00:23:31.874]  Everybody was in the media fawning over her.
[00:23:31.974 --> 00:23:34.555]  You know, BP stands for British Petroleum.
[00:23:34.615 --> 00:23:39.876]  Maybe I missed it, but I saw no protesters in New York where she visited.
[00:23:39.996 --> 00:23:45.078]  It was fine, you know, protesting the fact that one of her big companies from her nation
[00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:51.020]  She's one of the biggest shareholders.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:24:03.686]  She's a eugenicist, she's a globalist, she's a carbon tax monster who promotes all this tyranny and everyone's fawning over some demonic, inbred old woman that our ancestors fought a war against.
[00:24:04.126 --> 00:24:10.429]  I mean, it's a disgusting joke and that's a good point that you raved about Queen Elizabeth II.
[00:24:10.849 --> 00:24:11.630]  I mean, what a fraud.
[00:24:14.811 --> 00:24:19.334]  You were one of the first to say evacuations would happen, or that was the info you were getting.
[00:24:19.374 --> 00:24:21.255]  Now we do see the media starting to promote it.
[00:24:21.715 --> 00:24:27.718]  So again, what is Halliburton and BP and others and all these companies going to do as that oil comes in?
[00:24:28.404 --> 00:24:31.785]  Well, I think we're going to see the censorship and the PR spin continue.
[00:24:31.805 --> 00:24:45.288]  We'll get some reports, obviously, through the blockade, but I would note that my report on the evacuations was picked up by some websites, and just in the last week they printed retractions.
[00:24:45.388 --> 00:24:55.471]  Obviously, they got called by BP's big PR bigwigs and told to retract or at least amend
[00:24:56.011 --> 00:24:57.071]  The original story.
[00:24:57.152 --> 00:25:01.713]  What BP is doing is trying to limit the exposure of this disaster.
[00:25:02.634 --> 00:25:06.195]  And now we have them shopping around for investment money in places like Libya.
[00:25:06.215 --> 00:25:08.596]  They're going to Gaddafi to get bailed out.
[00:25:09.156 --> 00:25:10.497]  And other countries.
[00:25:10.617 --> 00:25:14.438]  So I think that's what we're seeing there.
[00:25:14.498 --> 00:25:16.679]  And where is the Environmental Protection Agency?
[00:25:17.339 --> 00:25:20.422]  Lisa Jackson, who came out of New York, who's the administrator.
[00:25:20.762 --> 00:25:22.403]  We've seen nothing from the EPA.
[00:25:22.423 --> 00:25:27.888]  So the Coast Guard, the EPA, all very silent or complicit with the EPA.
[00:25:27.908 --> 00:25:28.969]  Well, this is globalism.
[00:25:28.989 --> 00:25:30.130]  This is corporate governance.
[00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.290]  Back in 70 seconds.
[00:25:31.351 --> 00:25:36.014]  Five more minutes with Wayne Madsen, then Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us to talk about a host of issues.
[00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:36.655]  Stay with us.
[00:25:37.636 --> 00:25:42.740]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:26:52.114 --> 00:26:54.015]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:26:54.495 --> 00:26:57.377]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:04.661]  Big Brother.
[00:27:05.321 --> 00:27:06.382]  Mainstream media.
[00:27:07.082 --> 00:27:08.263]  Government cover-ups.
[00:27:08.283 --> 00:27:09.663]  You want answers?
[00:27:10.424 --> 00:27:11.444]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:11.984 --> 00:27:15.606]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:16.167 --> 00:27:20.229]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:24.653]  We've reached the halfway point in this worldwide broadcast.
[00:27:24.693 --> 00:27:41.867]  We have Chris Emery joining us in studio, one of the leading researchers on Oklahoma City, to look back at that government bombing operation used to demonize conservatives and patriots as they geared up to stage more terror attacks on themselves as a pretext to attack the American people.
[00:27:42.969 --> 00:27:50.401]  Meanwhile, a New York National Guard unit scanned vehicles for gun confiscation in the capital of New York, Albany.
[00:27:50.481 --> 00:27:53.165]  Amazing report out of Fox News.
[00:27:54.221 --> 00:28:04.726]  News 23, we have a detailed breakdown of the history of this and how they're slowly acclimating people for full-bore martial law, but now it's really reaching the boiling point at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:04.866 --> 00:28:06.626]  We've got four minutes left with Wayne Madsen.
[00:28:07.387 --> 00:28:13.750]  Wayne, other tidbits here, because the statistics of the
[00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:27.215]  51 year life expectancy of Exxon Valdez workers and the statistics I saw, the government admits it was the dispersants they believe that were the main thing that really caused the autoimmune diseases and cancers to go off the charts.
[00:28:27.575 --> 00:28:33.238]  They're using a lot more of this stuff this time than they did in Alaska and a lot more populated areas.
[00:28:33.598 --> 00:28:35.459]  How does BP think they're going to get away with this?
[00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:42.551]  Well, we're going to buy judges, and we already see them judge shopping for these civil suits.
[00:28:42.612 --> 00:28:51.174]  We see how they try to get these cases bundled to put them under Lynn Hughes in Houston, who has a conflict of interest.
[00:28:51.214 --> 00:28:53.074]  He takes money from the oil industry.
[00:28:53.474 --> 00:28:59.256]  Martin Feldman, the one in New Orleans, who overturned the moratorium on drilling, he's got ties to the oil industry.
[00:28:59.276 --> 00:29:02.477]  And Mark Fuller in Montgomery, Alabama, is a
[00:29:04.657 --> 00:29:04.998]  I don't
[00:29:22.277 --> 00:29:23.118]  We're good to go.
[00:29:48.294 --> 00:29:50.896]  All right, here's my last question on that issue.
[00:29:51.256 --> 00:29:54.819]  We know Obama is one of the main minions of BP.
[00:29:54.839 --> 00:29:58.702]  We know Rahm Emanuel had his apartment for many years paid for illegally.
[00:29:58.722 --> 00:30:02.685]  That's coming out in the Bogoyevich trial there in D.C.
[00:30:02.705 --> 00:30:03.345]  where you live.
[00:30:04.146 --> 00:30:08.129]  We know that they set up Cap-and-Trade with Enron.
[00:30:08.369 --> 00:30:12.212]  We know this is a top New World Order globalist organization.
[00:30:13.032 --> 00:30:16.537]  And then we have the media acting like Obama has his foot on their neck.
[00:30:16.878 --> 00:30:23.548]  Is that part of the PR ruse to try to not have it come out that Obama is basically on the payroll?
[00:30:24.229 --> 00:30:36.615]  Well, yeah, of course Obama entertained the BP executives of the White House in an announcement with his $20 billion cap on damages, and that's nowhere near what this is going to cost.
[00:30:37.095 --> 00:30:41.258]  I think in terms of over a trillion dollars, maybe closer to $2 trillion.
[00:30:41.698 --> 00:30:50.162]  But what price can you put on the Gulf of Mexico and the other oceans that could be affected by this disaster?
[00:30:50.342 --> 00:30:52.423]  And now they say it may just go on forever.
[00:30:52.463 --> 00:30:54.423]  Now they're not even trying to talk about fixing it.
[00:30:54.443 --> 00:30:56.344]  It's just, this is the way it is now.
[00:30:57.324 --> 00:30:57.924]  Well, that's right.
[00:30:57.964 --> 00:31:06.406]  And the people who are complacent up here, it's a matter of time before this gets into the Chesapeake, the largest estuary in North America.
[00:31:06.626 --> 00:31:08.026]  And we're going to see that.
[00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:14.128]  They're already making emergency plans in North Carolina when this hits the Outer Banks.
[00:31:14.768 --> 00:31:17.270]  So this is not going to be limited to the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:29.958]  And when it hits the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, the richest fishing grounds that North America and Europe depend on, then we're going to see, you know, basically you can just kiss off seafood as a staple.
[00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:48.231]  It's just horrible.
[00:31:49.232 --> 00:31:50.733]  Wayne Madsen, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:31:50.753 --> 00:31:52.874]  We appreciate your time with us.
[00:31:52.894 --> 00:31:53.875]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[00:31:53.915 --> 00:31:54.295]  Thank you.
[00:31:54.315 --> 00:31:54.876]  Okay.
[00:31:54.916 --> 00:31:57.458]  We'll be right back with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:32:00.714 --> 00:32:04.335]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:04.675 --> 00:32:12.797]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:13.537 --> 00:32:17.578]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:18.158 --> 00:32:28.980]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:38.622]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:39.122 --> 00:32:44.163]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:44.544 --> 00:32:51.725]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[00:33:55.714 --> 00:33:57.455]  This information is too important to wait.
[00:33:58.373 --> 00:34:02.616]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:34:02.916 --> 00:34:03.197]  Number 1.
[00:34:03.837 --> 00:34:06.999]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:07.820]  Number 2.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.684]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:34:13.024 --> 00:34:13.464]  It's true.
[00:34:13.764 --> 00:34:18.328]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:34:18.628 --> 00:34:19.168]  Number 3.
[00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:22.751]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:34:23.051 --> 00:34:26.734]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:34:26.934 --> 00:34:27.495]  Number 4.
[00:34:27.735 --> 00:34:30.097]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:34:30.497 --> 00:34:33.881]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:34:34.181 --> 00:34:34.721]  Number 5.
[00:34:34.982 --> 00:34:38.885]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:34:39.125 --> 00:34:43.890]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:48.192]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:34:48.332 --> 00:34:49.892]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:34:50.112 --> 00:34:52.193]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:34:52.373 --> 00:34:54.975]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:34:54.995 --> 00:35:02.278]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:35:02.778 --> 00:35:05.559]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:10.905 --> 00:35:27.640]  For the balance of the hour, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former Wall Street Journal editor, the head of policy, Department of Treasury, the father of Reaganomics, syndicated columnist and best-selling author, is our guest to talk about a host of issues, but the main one is the gear up for the attack on Iran.
[00:35:28.281 --> 00:35:31.444]  More and more it's being green-lighted by the Israelis, the U.S.
[00:35:31.464 --> 00:35:31.984]  government, and
[00:35:34.107 --> 00:35:45.905]  When he thinks it may happen how it can be stopped But what will happen if they hit Iran from his research before I do that I mentioned earlier at the end of the last hour this video talking about solutions the secret of Oz
[00:35:47.694 --> 00:35:53.457]  By the maker of The Money Masters, and we have that film available as well, by Bill Still.
[00:35:53.497 --> 00:35:57.519]  He's been all over the world, Iceland, you name it, where they're fighting back against these people.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.360]  And this has some great solutions.
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:08.486]  You know, not a gold-backed currency, because the bankers pretty much dominate that, but a government-controlled fiat system, and basically how to bring these people to justice.
[00:36:08.826 --> 00:36:11.327]  The Secret of Oz, Solutions for a Broken Economy.
[00:36:11.707 --> 00:36:12.528]  Very important film.
[00:36:12.548 --> 00:36:13.788]  We sold out of this last week.
[00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:16.110]  We just got more in today.
[00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:20.072]  So get your orders in for The Secret of Oz.
[00:36:20.352 --> 00:36:34.560]  We have a new special running for a limited time where you can order the new films we produced, Police State, For the Rise of FEMA, and of course Invisible Empire, and get a copy of Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, free.
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:39.346]  We have several other choices you can make on Infowars.com.
[00:36:39.366 --> 00:36:44.993]  You can look for the banners up on the site to take you to the subsection of the shopping cart that has those specials.
[00:36:45.374 --> 00:36:51.962]  And your purchase of the books and videos not only gives you a tool to wake people up and to inform yourself to a higher level, but also
[00:36:52.643 --> 00:37:05.490]  Supports this transmission and the important work we're doing here, and I couldn't do it without all of you out there and speaking of support prison planet TV we simulcast The at least part of the radio show starting next week.
[00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:11.314]  I'm gonna simulcast the entire radio show from there on out via streaming video with the
[00:37:11.894 --> 00:37:32.680]  Four cameras shooting here at PrisonPlanet.TV and we put an exclusive PrisonPlanet.TV video up where I sent my guys Rob Due and Jason Douglas to Chicago where they let them into the drills, taking over sports stadiums, using them as FEMA camps, Polish troops training to quote take on American terrorists and for gun confiscation.
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:40.422]  That 25 minute video is up on PrisonPlanet.TV right now for members and we have this report out from Fox
[00:37:42.086 --> 00:37:43.627]  Twenty-three in Albany, New York.
[00:37:44.387 --> 00:37:48.109]  New York National Guard unit scanned vehicles for gun confiscations.
[00:37:48.129 --> 00:37:49.010]  They drive you through.
[00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:50.891]  If they find a gun, they take you to jail.
[00:37:50.951 --> 00:37:52.191]  I mean, this is on the news now.
[00:37:52.992 --> 00:37:56.754]  So the slow-creeping martial law is just intensifying.
[00:37:57.214 --> 00:38:07.279]  And before we get into the economy and the oil spill and the Iran situation, because as Roberts predicted a few years ago, when governments and banks get in trouble, they launch new wars.
[00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:11.021]  Let me ask him about the police state, because he writes about that.
[00:38:12.182 --> 00:38:13.663]  Dr. Roberts, good to have you back with us.
[00:38:14.545 --> 00:38:15.486]  Glad to be with you, Alex.
[00:38:15.866 --> 00:38:17.668]  There he is, joining us via video Skype.
[00:38:18.449 --> 00:38:26.699]  You've written a lot about the police state, but now we have the military more and more on the streets of America, really violating posse comitatus.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.201]  What's your take on that?
[00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:36.394]  Well, I suppose, Alex, they just want to make sure that we forget about the Constitution and our rights.
[00:38:37.294 --> 00:38:48.502]  I think they realize that they've created a mess for us, both internationally and domestically, both militarily and economically.
[00:38:48.722 --> 00:38:55.507]  And they want to be sure that the people will just sort of give up and accept their fate.
[00:38:59.781 --> 00:39:02.483]  What do you think the American people's response to this should be?
[00:39:04.905 --> 00:39:09.589]  Well, I think they should get very angry and be very well armed and very well organized.
[00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:17.815]  You know, one of the problems, Alex, as you know very well, is that so many Americans get confused about what patriotism is.
[00:39:17.835 --> 00:39:23.180]  So many of them think that being patriotic means supporting the government.
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:27.123]  They don't understand that it means supporting the Constitution.
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:28.741]  I think
[00:39:45.436 --> 00:39:57.105]  We're right that your worst enemy is always your government because it alone has the power to break you and control you.
[00:39:57.185 --> 00:40:04.691]  So I think we're a long way from the vast majority of American people coming to that realization.
[00:40:06.735 --> 00:40:08.917]  Well, I think you're absolutely right.
[00:40:08.957 --> 00:40:11.980]  People are going to have to get hurt a lot worse than they've already been abused.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:17.284]  And, boy, I tell you, I read Bloomberg reporting 46 states are on the verge of going bankrupt.
[00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:25.452]  Federal regulators are, quote, ordering outside of law for large pension fund managers to, quote, invest in failed banks.
[00:40:25.532 --> 00:40:27.493]  Suddenly, CNBC reports that the
[00:40:28.414 --> 00:40:33.478]  Uh, graphs mirror the 1929-1933 depression graph.
[00:40:33.498 --> 00:40:35.259]  The New York Times says third depression.
[00:40:35.279 --> 00:40:39.002]  The London Telegraph says depression, that all the numbers show depression.
[00:40:39.022 --> 00:40:47.489]  Uh, this is pretty scary to have the mainstream media now going from denying we were even in a recession to saying that we may be in a depression.
[00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.011]  Yes, it is kind of funny, isn't it?
[00:40:51.191 --> 00:40:55.615]  I mean, you know, it seems it was just the other day that we had recovery, recovery, recovery.
[00:40:57.668 --> 00:41:05.752]  As you know, I've said for some time that there's no recovery because there's nothing left to recover.
[00:41:06.992 --> 00:41:22.358]  Keep in mind that our pensions, or what remains of them, are in grave danger now because if we do continue into a depression, the government's budget deficit will become huge.
[00:41:22.438 --> 00:41:24.699]  I mean, it's already almost half
[00:41:25.419 --> 00:41:25.859]  Of course.
[00:41:40.872 --> 00:41:41.433]  We're good to go.
[00:41:58.075 --> 00:42:03.717]  With the situation being as bad as it is, the bonds won't be worth very much.
[00:42:04.297 --> 00:42:08.578]  And so that's how they will finish off our pensions.
[00:42:09.099 --> 00:42:12.900]  Alternatively, they will simply say, well, we're going to have a capital levy.
[00:42:13.897 --> 00:42:14.758]  On your pensions.
[00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:21.167]  We're going to take a certain percentage of it to make up for the fact that it's been accumulating tax-free.
[00:42:21.928 --> 00:42:26.073]  And then they will use that money to finance the government.
[00:42:26.154 --> 00:42:26.995]  You know, for a while.
[00:42:27.015 --> 00:42:28.517]  I mean, that money runs out.
[00:42:28.537 --> 00:42:29.698]  They can only spend it once.
[00:42:30.583 --> 00:42:34.964]  So people don't really quite know how bad it's going to be.
[00:42:35.604 --> 00:42:51.447]  And you can see that all the stimulus programs, despite the massive size, have failed to alleviate the unemployment and apparently have failed to stop the downward descent of the economy.
[00:42:51.487 --> 00:42:55.348]  So if you have the largest budget deficit in history and the lowest interest rates,
[00:42:56.345 --> 00:43:07.773]  And they can't stop an economic downturn, then you don't really have any policy left to use.
[00:43:08.313 --> 00:43:23.503]  So I think we're headed into a very serious situation that will, as I've said many times, undermine the dollar as the reserve currency, and therefore undermine our ability to import.
[00:43:24.554 --> 00:43:28.918]  Which will affect a whole range of product availability.
[00:43:28.958 --> 00:43:31.179]  Well, sir, that brings me to my next question.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:39.646]  We have, of course, the New York Times, CNN, and others last week coming out and saying, oh, the U.N.
[00:43:39.746 --> 00:43:45.091]  says get rid of the dollars, the world reserve currency, have a SDR, special drawing rights,
[00:43:46.071 --> 00:43:58.740]  And that we'll still have the currencies of the world, but we're going to devalue those, and then all that will be left is this new bank-to-bank thing backed up by the carbon tax, and then it will be basically a global government run by private banks.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:11.969]  So, this is out in the open, and then it's clear that's why they're wrecking things by design, is to force us onto the wreckage of our society that will basically be this new global government.
[00:44:12.649 --> 00:44:20.233]  And, you know, like you said last time when you were on with us about a month ago, that clearly the government is now trying to destroy America by design.
[00:44:20.253 --> 00:44:26.096]  Can you speak to the SDR, this move to a new level of the Ponzi scheme?
[00:44:27.357 --> 00:44:28.258]  Well, Alex, the SDR is...
[00:44:33.214 --> 00:44:33.374]  I think?
[00:44:52.495 --> 00:45:08.951]  Point out that the United States was in enough financial difficulty that maybe the puppet states in Europe would distance themselves a little bit and stop supporting such an aggressive American policy in the rest of the world.
[00:45:09.131 --> 00:45:13.054]  Not only toward Iran, but it's also toward Russia.
[00:45:14.015 --> 00:45:22.639]  We have Hillary Clinton in Georgia the other day rebuking Russia for occupying Georgia.
[00:45:22.659 --> 00:45:24.220]  Well, they don't occupy Georgia.
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:33.784]  So I think that that is not meant as a serious solution to the problem.
[00:45:33.844 --> 00:45:41.268]  And I think when the UN report raises it, it's really meant to call attention
[00:45:42.088 --> 00:46:11.191]  To the fact that there isn't a stable dollar and that the whole world relies on the dollar as reserve currency and that the behavior of the United States government running up the massive budget deficits with wars they can't afford, with bank bailouts they can't afford, and running up massive trade deficits by offshoring the industry and the professional service jobs,
[00:46:12.008 --> 00:46:23.365]  That I think it's directed at calling attention to the fact that American leadership is not long for this world.
[00:46:24.206 --> 00:46:27.331]  It's run out because the resource base for it
[00:46:28.308 --> 00:46:29.649]  Has run out.
[00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:54.601]  Doctor, when we come back, let's talk about how you see this unfolding then, and how an attack on Iran factors in, and why the establishment seems to think in their own writings that a large global war, as the Rand Corporation said two years ago, would somehow prop up the Anglo-American-Dutch-slash-Israeli alliance, and what you see happening to the U.S.
[00:46:54.641 --> 00:46:55.061]  economy.
[00:46:55.381 --> 00:46:57.302]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[00:46:59.397 --> 00:47:03.619]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:47:03.939 --> 00:47:08.001]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:47:08.281 --> 00:47:13.404]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:16.470]  We're good to go!
[00:47:40.137 --> 00:47:44.899]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:47:45.179 --> 00:47:49.201]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:47:49.361 --> 00:47:50.922]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:47:51.142 --> 00:47:53.223]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:47:53.383 --> 00:47:55.744]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:47:59.463 --> 00:48:09.206]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:15.528]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:48:15.928 --> 00:48:24.771]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:48:25.151 --> 00:48:34.053]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:48:34.334 --> 00:48:38.915]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:48:38.935 --> 00:48:40.495]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:48:40.735 --> 00:48:43.236]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[00:51:10.409 --> 00:51:22.153]  Folks, we sit here and we analyze this coldly every day, but when I'm sitting back, you know, at 11 o'clock at night reading a book, about to turn the light out and go to bed, it just really dawns on me.
[00:51:23.093 --> 00:51:29.235]  We really do have a bunch of Ponzi scheme crooks that wrecked the most wealthy, powerful, wonderful nation in history.
[00:51:29.715 --> 00:51:32.856]  And we've gone from the apple of the world's eye, the light of liberty,
[00:51:34.056 --> 00:51:36.378]  To the country that promotes all these illegal wars.
[00:51:36.838 --> 00:51:40.021]  We've just basically invaded Costa Rica with 44 ships.
[00:51:40.682 --> 00:51:42.103]  It's got their country in an uproar.
[00:51:42.723 --> 00:51:47.347]  We're a nation that promotes torture, secret arrest, and it's only getting worse!
[00:51:48.188 --> 00:51:51.311]  Dr. Roberts, as we went to break, I threw out the question.
[00:51:52.111 --> 00:51:58.477]  How do you see this unfolding and how does an attack on Iran play into it from your historical research?
[00:52:00.305 --> 00:52:11.753]  Well, Alex, they want to attack Iran for several reasons, and I suppose the most important is this ideology of American hedge enemy.
[00:52:12.793 --> 00:52:16.816]  And this is the trouble with the one world stuff.
[00:52:18.377 --> 00:52:22.840]  If the Americans talk about one world, what they mean is an American world.
[00:52:25.528 --> 00:52:30.369]  And so, if you look at the Middle East, what's the remaining independent countries?
[00:52:30.429 --> 00:52:33.750]  That is, what countries are not American puppet states?
[00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:37.371]  And we have only Iran and Syria.
[00:52:38.091 --> 00:52:53.635]  Now, the reasoning, I'm told, from the people that I still know in Washington, is that Syria they can ignore, because if they knock off Iran, Syria will simply voluntarily become an American puppet state.
[00:52:54.457 --> 00:52:56.409]  And so they're after Iran.
[00:52:57.729 --> 00:53:06.114]  They would love to have one of their color revolutions and get rid of it without military means.
[00:53:06.214 --> 00:53:10.737]  But they want to get rid of it at any cost.
[00:53:11.197 --> 00:53:16.160]  And you can see that's the reason for all the years of demonization and lies.
[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:26.326]  And most recently, when the United States somehow got the Security Council of the UN to go along with sanctions.
[00:53:28.602 --> 00:53:29.962]  What did the Americans do?
[00:53:29.982 --> 00:53:31.123]  The minute they got the U.N.
[00:53:31.163 --> 00:53:36.165]  sanctions, Washington then added their own unilateral sanctions.
[00:53:36.726 --> 00:53:47.371]  Which Ron Paul has pointed out on the House floor, and he's read the international law and our national law, that's an act of war, and now in Germany they're not fueling Iranian aircraft?
[00:53:47.411 --> 00:53:48.852]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:53:49.552 --> 00:53:54.474]  Yes, but you see what Washington's doing, it's using the U.N.
[00:53:54.534 --> 00:53:55.075]  sanctions.
[00:53:56.247 --> 00:53:58.769]  As a basis for its own.
[00:53:58.869 --> 00:54:00.871]  Well, the Russians said, you've double-crossed us.
[00:54:02.913 --> 00:54:11.500]  And the media will never differentiate between the UN sanctions, which are not so severe, and the American sanctions that have been added to them.
[00:54:12.161 --> 00:54:22.910]  And the ships that we have dispatched, allegedly to stop Iranian ships on the high seas and inspect their cargoes, another act of war,
[00:54:25.908 --> 00:54:30.253]  They're not going to simply be enforcing their own sanctions.
[00:54:30.894 --> 00:54:43.109]  So we've double-crossed the Security Council again, and we're hoping that some sort of instant will come out of this so that we can have some justification
[00:54:46.778 --> 00:54:54.881]  Some... I don't know what happened to the... So we can have some kind of a justification for the attack on Iran.
[00:54:54.901 --> 00:55:04.244]  Now if you go back to Bush's speech, it was January 29, 2002, when he says there's this axis of evil.
[00:55:04.364 --> 00:55:06.925]  There's Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.
[00:55:07.545 --> 00:55:12.567]  And he sort of brought together these three countries which have nothing in common.
[00:55:14.056 --> 00:55:18.178]  North Korea is the last communist country that's isolated in the Far East.
[00:55:18.798 --> 00:55:25.780]  Iran and Iraq had just been fighting an eight-year war, a million casualties.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.901]  One is secular, one is Shiite.
[00:55:27.941 --> 00:55:29.162]  They're at each other's throats.
[00:55:29.502 --> 00:55:30.882]  Well, one was Sunni, one Shiite.
[00:55:33.103 --> 00:55:35.705]  Who've been at odds since the seventh century.
[00:55:36.105 --> 00:55:36.906]  Nothing in common.
[00:55:37.346 --> 00:55:45.812]  And yet, Bush's neoconservative wordcraft has created this notion of a common enemy that we face.
[00:55:46.332 --> 00:55:55.819]  So I think, you know, what they are hoping is they can somehow come up with a color revolution.
[00:55:56.803 --> 00:56:10.049]  That with all this pressure on that the forces within Iran that we've been subsidizing will somehow come out on top to avoid the conflict with America.
[00:56:10.469 --> 00:56:16.252]  But if not, I think they're prepared to try to have some sort of a major military knockout blow because
[00:56:17.032 --> 00:56:22.855]  Anything less than that, if Iran responds, they probably could block the oil flows from the Persian Gulf.
[00:56:22.995 --> 00:56:23.916]  All right, stay there, Doc.
[00:56:23.976 --> 00:56:25.317]  Long, long segment coming up.
[00:56:25.377 --> 00:56:26.877]  I want you to continue to break that down.
[00:56:26.898 --> 00:56:32.861]  When we come back, I'm going to also get into the fact that this is an act of war, saying they're going to board their ships.
[00:56:33.421 --> 00:56:36.403]  And Iran has said, you start boarding our ships, we're going to board your ships.
[00:56:36.983 --> 00:56:44.530]  And that's exactly what Cheney wanted back in 2007, that came out in New Yorker Magazine, was to actually attack our own ships and blame it on Iran.
[00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:47.233]  So we may see a false flag in the mix here as well.
[00:56:47.513 --> 00:56:48.194]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:49.515 --> 00:56:50.416]  We're on the march.
[00:56:50.917 --> 00:56:52.498]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:56:53.439 --> 00:56:56.122]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:07.441]  Okay, going back to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:02:07.461 --> 01:02:17.305]  You were finishing up with Iran and talking about trying to get our ships in their own waters, boarding all of their ships, saying they're not allowed to have fuel,
[01:02:17.645 --> 01:02:20.568]  They're not allowed to have any finished goods.
[01:02:21.129 --> 01:02:26.975]  I mean, this is a classic act of siege of war, and the Iranians are saying they're going to resist.
[01:02:27.456 --> 01:02:30.739]  I remember Bush five years ago admitted in a White House press release that they had
[01:02:31.986 --> 01:02:32.447]  I don't
[01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:54.189]  They're in there bombing the daylights with terrorists inside Iran.
[01:02:54.249 --> 01:02:55.630]  Iran lays there and takes it.
[01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:58.852]  But I can't see Iran putting up with its ships being boarded.
[01:02:58.872 --> 01:03:01.714]  I mean, and how is our media going to spin that?
[01:03:01.974 --> 01:03:03.335]  How dare them Iranians?
[01:03:03.375 --> 01:03:05.516]  They wouldn't let our military board their ships.
[01:03:05.556 --> 01:03:09.259]  I mean, is there no end to the evil that this country won't engage in?
[01:03:10.663 --> 01:03:11.343]  Apparently not.
[01:03:11.363 --> 01:03:21.268]  I mean, look, the Israelis just got away with boarding the aid flotilla to Gaza, killing all those people, and nothing has happened.
[01:03:22.289 --> 01:03:27.991]  Once again, we protected them diplomatically, so if we let them do it, we probably figure we can do it too.
[01:03:29.432 --> 01:03:31.953]  So I don't think, you know, the real question is,
[01:03:34.445 --> 01:03:36.568]  Why does the rest of the world go along with this?
[01:03:36.928 --> 01:03:41.895]  Now, my answer to the Europeans is they're all American puppet states.
[01:03:41.915 --> 01:03:45.820]  We've bought their leadership, and they're our puppets.
[01:03:46.321 --> 01:03:48.064]  But why Russia and China?
[01:03:49.555 --> 01:04:00.924]  For some reason, Russia has never delivered the sophisticated missile air defense that they contracted with Iran to supply.
[01:04:01.464 --> 01:04:04.346]  And they haven't delivered it because we keep telling them not to.
[01:04:04.426 --> 01:04:10.931]  So why does Russia allow us to interfere with their contract with Iran?
[01:04:11.572 --> 01:04:12.853]  And then look at China.
[01:04:12.893 --> 01:04:15.475]  China has massive energy investments.
[01:04:16.454 --> 01:04:20.497]  In Iran and China's economy is still going gangbusters.
[01:04:20.537 --> 01:04:21.298]  They need energy.
[01:04:22.018 --> 01:04:26.541]  And our plan for dealing with China is to cut them off from energy.
[01:04:27.342 --> 01:04:31.285]  So why would China go along with this?
[01:04:31.305 --> 01:04:37.329]  It seems to me that those are questions that I don't know the answer to.
[01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:43.073]  But the rest of the world is somehow complicit in this.
[01:04:43.954 --> 01:04:54.799]  And it makes no sense because the world knows that Bill Clinton lied about the Serbian-Kosovo-Albanian dispute.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:05:00.442]  We know that Bush lied about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction.
[01:05:01.943 --> 01:05:09.207]  We have the International Atomic Energy Agency reports from the inspectors on the ground that there's no diversion.
[01:05:09.947 --> 01:05:10.327]  I think?
[01:05:30.336 --> 01:05:38.883]  Why doesn't somebody ask the President, how do you know they have a weapons program when your own intelligence agency says they don't?
[01:05:40.364 --> 01:05:45.248]  How do you know they have weapons when all the Atomic Energy Agency reports say they don't?
[01:05:45.668 --> 01:05:51.593]  How can they possibly have weapons when your own authorities say they're not capable of enriching uranium?
[01:05:52.372 --> 01:05:53.192]  To that extent.
[01:05:54.013 --> 01:05:55.194]  No one asks these questions.
[01:05:55.254 --> 01:05:56.654]  Nobody in the media asks them.
[01:05:57.015 --> 01:06:10.442]  And Iran has tried, on what, three separate occasions, to give their uranium under UN supervision to the French, to the Turks, to the Brazilians, to enrich it where it's at a level that can't be used in weapons.
[01:06:10.882 --> 01:06:14.024]  And that only enrages the United States and Israel more.
[01:06:14.484 --> 01:06:15.645]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[01:06:15.745 --> 01:06:17.326]  We are the bad guys in this.
[01:06:17.666 --> 01:06:20.447]  We've overthrown Iran's government twice in the last century.
[01:06:21.708 --> 01:06:24.990]  And it's just outrageous that they're positioning us this way.
[01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:34.756]  But from every expert I talked to, Ray McGovern, top CIA analyst, and many others, and just common sense in studying the region, there's close to 70 million Iranians.
[01:06:35.137 --> 01:06:39.099]  They haven't been under siege for a decade plus, like Iraq.
[01:06:39.499 --> 01:06:40.700]  They have high-tech weapons.
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:45.083]  They do have sleeper cells, as any large nation does in other countries.
[01:06:46.283 --> 01:06:48.164]  And this is the perfect storm.
[01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:49.184]  They attack Iran.
[01:06:49.585 --> 01:06:52.066]  They won't have to stage terror attacks once the war is on.
[01:06:52.506 --> 01:06:53.626]  Iran will strike back.
[01:06:53.686 --> 01:06:54.847]  It'll be called terrorism.
[01:06:55.147 --> 01:07:06.912]  And the system is going to use this crisis as a pretext to crack down on domestic populations in the U.S., grab pension funds, and do all the other things they do when we're distracted by a war.
[01:07:07.252 --> 01:07:09.793]  And so this is good for the system to start a war.
[01:07:10.413 --> 01:07:14.998]  And a lot of people like to rally around the flag when we are blowing the hell out of some poor group of brown people.
[01:07:15.518 --> 01:07:21.004]  And so I see the system going ahead with it, and all the indicators we've got out of Israel and out of the U.S.
[01:07:21.024 --> 01:07:24.047]  government is, they are moving towards a full green light on this.
[01:07:24.087 --> 01:07:29.832]  What's your take on the green light, and when you think it's coming, and what the aftermath of this war will be?
[01:07:30.782 --> 01:07:33.644]  Well, Alex, I don't think anyone knows when it's coming.
[01:07:33.684 --> 01:07:41.831]  I don't even think the people planning it know that, because they're looking for some sort of a rationale, excuse, opportunity.
[01:07:43.112 --> 01:07:47.575]  So, and the outcome, I don't think, is known either.
[01:07:49.957 --> 01:07:54.121]  If I were the Iranians, I wouldn't sit there and wait for the attack.
[01:07:55.582 --> 01:07:58.844]  I mean, why respond after you've been
[01:07:59.989 --> 01:08:00.670]  Badly hurt.
[01:08:02.813 --> 01:08:17.272]  Once I knew the attack was coming and nothing could be done about it, if I were the Iranians, I simply would take out the American aircraft carriers, I would let everything that I had fall on Israel, and I would start it.
[01:08:18.131 --> 01:08:25.277]  Because I wouldn't sit there and then respond with whatever I happen to have left after I've had a massive attack.
[01:08:25.577 --> 01:08:37.407]  You know, the other day, the head of the University of London's Center for International Affairs said that they're gearing up for the total destruction of Iran.
[01:08:38.476 --> 01:08:42.420]  You see, we've got troops in 10 countries surrounding Iran.
[01:08:42.961 --> 01:08:46.284]  We've stockpiled all these bunker-buster bombs.
[01:08:46.384 --> 01:08:50.569]  Apparently, we've even moved tactical nuclear weapons.
[01:08:50.589 --> 01:08:51.530]  Diego Garcia.
[01:08:52.691 --> 01:08:52.992]  Yes.
[01:08:53.993 --> 01:08:57.757]  And so, I don't think
[01:08:59.025 --> 01:09:07.670]  That they would be doing all of this just in order to scare Iran or pressure them.
[01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:11.972]  No, this is a full court press, just like before the invasion of Iraq both times.
[01:09:12.773 --> 01:09:20.797]  And you're right, they've said that if Iran fights back in any way under Bush, and Obama's continued this doctrine, that they will use nuclear weapons on them.
[01:09:20.837 --> 01:09:27.541]  So if Iran lifts a hand to protect themselves, the media is going to scream like it's the end of the world.
[01:09:28.121 --> 01:09:35.606]  And I guess Americans are going to sit there while their cities are being nuked, feeling powerful and running American flags out on flagpoles.
[01:09:36.487 --> 01:09:40.770]  Meanwhile, the same global corporate crime syndicate is destroying America's future.
[01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:47.655]  So I guess in a way, if Americans go along with this war, I'm going to have to say we're cursed and we deserve for the bankers to rape us.
[01:09:48.095 --> 01:09:51.317]  But I don't deserve to be raped by them.
[01:09:51.598 --> 01:09:54.560]  So what do you do as an individual living in Nazi Germany?
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:57.222]  Yes, you'd be quiet.
[01:09:59.059 --> 01:10:12.231]  Listen, Alex, you know, I think that if they do strike Iran in some horrendous way, one possibility would be that all of the colonized puppet state Muslims
[01:10:13.717 --> 01:10:22.945]  would feel so absolutely wronged and powerless that they could possibly overthrow the American puppets.
[01:10:23.846 --> 01:10:27.109]  You might see revolution in Egypt, in Jordan.
[01:10:27.969 --> 01:10:30.051]  You might see it even in Saudi Arabia.
[01:10:31.432 --> 01:10:36.377]  It's entirely possible that we would simply be going too far
[01:10:37.626 --> 01:10:42.410]  and undermine all the puppet regimes that we have already established there.
[01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:52.718]  So there are many potential downsides to this that don't appear to figure in the calculations of the Americans or the Israelis.
[01:10:53.558 --> 01:11:01.024]  And of course, if it disrupts oil in any significant way, that would be really detrimental.
[01:11:02.865 --> 01:11:13.929]  Doctor, doesn't Israel losing in Lebanon three and a half years ago, and having other setbacks, I mean, doesn't that give them some pause before they just head us into World War III?
[01:11:14.409 --> 01:11:17.230]  No, you see, if they get rid of Iran,
[01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:21.893]  Then there's no one to support Hezbollah and Hamas.
[01:11:22.674 --> 01:11:27.178]  And so that's the other reason we didn't get to for the attack on Iran.
[01:11:27.598 --> 01:11:35.865]  It gets rid of all the support for the forces that block Israel from stealing all of Palestine and southern Lebanon.
[01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:46.752]  See, Israel is chomping at the bit to simply evict the few remaining Palestinians and to seize southern Lebanon.
[01:11:46.852 --> 01:11:49.994]  Yeah, they want past the Golan and that water supply.
[01:11:50.214 --> 01:11:52.316]  They want the water supply from southern Lebanon.
[01:11:52.356 --> 01:11:56.358]  So, that's their stake in this war.
[01:11:56.398 --> 01:11:58.100]  They want Iran out of it.
[01:11:59.239 --> 01:12:04.741]  Because then once Hezbollah uses up whatever weapons it has, it wouldn't have any more.
[01:12:05.441 --> 01:12:12.904]  And there would be no way to stop them from simply... How does Iran get the weapons in?
[01:12:12.924 --> 01:12:13.604]  Through Syria?
[01:12:13.945 --> 01:12:14.665]  I don't know.
[01:12:15.205 --> 01:12:20.387]  Why doesn't Iran just make a deal with Israel and have a peace treaty?
[01:12:20.407 --> 01:12:23.548]  Because Iran is looking down the barrel of a nuclear bomb.
[01:12:24.949 --> 01:12:25.869]  I don't know that either.
[01:12:27.551 --> 01:12:32.608]  You know, as I've said, there's so many imponderables, and they're not discussed.
[01:12:32.889 --> 01:12:34.534]  I mean, why does Russia stand aside?
[01:12:35.882 --> 01:12:38.164]  Well, you said earlier Russia has now been betrayed.
[01:12:38.184 --> 01:12:44.208]  We know they've been trying to make deals with Barry Sotaro, known as Barack Obama, and that he's broken those.
[01:12:45.149 --> 01:12:48.491]  And then separately we see the fear-mongering about these 11 Russian spies.
[01:12:48.771 --> 01:12:54.856]  You notice the Russian spies, and now Russia admits they're spies and want to do a swap, weren't infiltrating the government, because that's ceremonial.
[01:12:55.116 --> 01:12:59.279]  They were infiltrating Harvard and Wall Street, because that's who runs this country.
[01:13:01.124 --> 01:13:02.905]  Well, you know, they're not accused of spying.
[01:13:03.245 --> 01:13:04.926]  They haven't done any spying.
[01:13:04.966 --> 01:13:08.407]  They're accused of not registering as a foreign agent.
[01:13:09.128 --> 01:13:12.529]  But, of course, APAC doesn't register as a foreign agent either.
[01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:17.672]  So, you know, I'm very suspicious of that whole thing and what it's about.
[01:13:18.472 --> 01:13:23.775]  Clearly, it's not a case of spying because there's no spy charges brought against them.
[01:13:24.682 --> 01:13:28.126]  Yeah, they're just agents of influence, which is just what business is.
[01:13:28.347 --> 01:13:29.808]  But we don't even know they're that.
[01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:35.315]  And it's also suspicious to me, Alex, that one of them confessed so quickly.
[01:13:36.316 --> 01:13:38.939]  It's almost like he's put there to confess.
[01:13:40.362 --> 01:13:59.763]  So maybe this is just another way of pressuring Russia to keep them sort of on the defensive and sidelined while we proceed with the roll-up of Iran.
[01:14:01.444 --> 01:14:18.778]  Maybe that's the explanation, because it was very strange to have the Russian president here meeting with Obama in the White House, and the Russians are falling all low themselves, trying to have good relations with us, despite us putting missile bases in Poland and everywhere else surrounding them.
[01:14:19.438 --> 01:14:23.300]  Turning Georgia into... Yeah, there's new press reports of more than 10 U.S.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:26.821]  bases being covertly built all around Russia, and this hoax!
[01:14:26.901 --> 01:14:31.983]  I've had neocons say that I'm a liar, and that Russia did attack Georgia.
[01:14:32.384 --> 01:14:41.588]  I mean, even CNN had to admit later, and Fox, that indeed, Georgia had attacked South Ossetia, and that that was all a hoax.
[01:14:41.708 --> 01:14:41.908]  I mean,
[01:14:42.688 --> 01:14:46.990]  I mean, it's incredible the baloney the American people are fed.
[01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:48.490]  I mean, I'm not for Russia.
[01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:49.411]  I'm an American.
[01:14:50.071 --> 01:14:55.353]  But I'm not going to sit here and lie and say that Russia attacked Georgia.
[01:14:55.373 --> 01:14:58.014]  I mean, it's like saying the moon's made out of cheese.
[01:14:58.415 --> 01:14:59.075]  Right, right.
[01:14:59.315 --> 01:15:00.135]  That's right.
[01:15:00.215 --> 01:15:03.457]  And the real question, though, you see, the European Union knows that.
[01:15:03.477 --> 01:15:10.560]  The European Union has made it clear that the Georgians, spurred on by the Americans, initiated that war.
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:17.422]  So why does the European Union continue to support the expansion of NATO?
[01:15:18.463 --> 01:15:22.604]  Why does it support the American war in Afghanistan?
[01:15:22.724 --> 01:15:30.127]  They have European Union troops under the NATO flag fighting our battles in Afghanistan.
[01:15:30.147 --> 01:15:30.668]  So why?
[01:15:31.068 --> 01:15:39.171]  See the real question is why do all these countries who've got nothing to gain from this and potentially a tremendous amount to lose
[01:15:40.273 --> 01:15:42.594]  Why are they giving us the green light?
[01:15:42.715 --> 01:15:43.555]  Well, we know why.
[01:15:43.595 --> 01:15:44.295]  We know why.
[01:15:44.476 --> 01:15:50.919]  And that's one reason the director was snapped up and put in prison decades after his reported crime.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:58.564]  If you've seen the movie Ghost Rider, it's actually based on what's been declassified, that Tony Blair was MI6.
[01:15:59.104 --> 01:16:06.169]  And we know there's been a 50-year covert Western program to get the major leaders of Europe elected or compromised.
[01:16:07.009 --> 01:16:11.672]  And that much of Europe is run by U.S., British, slash, Israeli puppets.
[01:16:12.053 --> 01:16:16.756]  And so that's why Europe goes along, because most of their leaders are actually U.S.
[01:16:16.796 --> 01:16:17.396]  intelligence.
[01:16:18.217 --> 01:16:21.479]  That's probably the case, or certainly on the payroll.
[01:16:21.819 --> 01:16:23.441]  But why Russia and China?
[01:16:24.241 --> 01:16:28.384]  I mean, China is a very powerful state.
[01:16:28.424 --> 01:16:29.125]  They're our banker.
[01:16:30.305 --> 01:16:30.826]  Why do they
[01:16:32.349 --> 01:16:36.773]  Because they made sweetheart deals, as you know, in the 70s to get our industry.
[01:16:36.994 --> 01:16:43.620]  And so they're so deeply in bed with corporate interests that they just can't get out of bed.
[01:16:44.421 --> 01:16:45.221]  But they have it now.
[01:16:46.343 --> 01:16:46.843]  They've got it.
[01:16:48.124 --> 01:16:48.965]  They don't need that anymore.
[01:16:48.985 --> 01:16:49.526]  They've got it.
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:57.204]  So maybe it's just they have a very short run time horizon on this particular issue.
[01:16:58.685 --> 01:17:00.366]  Or maybe it's just tradition.
[01:17:00.406 --> 01:17:02.467]  Maybe they're just going along.
[01:17:02.487 --> 01:17:12.473]  You know, for a century after the Roman Empire fell, the little principalities that grew up, they still put Caesar's head on their coins.
[01:17:14.858 --> 01:17:15.478]  Because.
[01:17:16.319 --> 01:17:18.860]  Otherwise, they thought people wouldn't trust the money.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:25.183]  So, maybe it's something like that, that everyone thinks that we're a superpower.
[01:17:25.203 --> 01:17:26.104]  We're not a superpower.
[01:17:26.124 --> 01:17:28.305]  Look, we can't finance our own wars.
[01:17:28.865 --> 01:17:30.986]  We can't finance our own government.
[01:17:31.086 --> 01:17:35.848]  But we can hold everybody hostage with 50,000 nuclear weapons and bio-weapons.
[01:17:36.769 --> 01:17:37.049]  Maybe.
[01:17:38.783 --> 01:17:40.704]  And, you know, they got a lot of secret weapons as well.
[01:17:41.024 --> 01:17:41.564]  I mean, that's it.
[01:17:41.584 --> 01:17:43.345]  I mean, it's like a bank robber with a gun to your head.
[01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:49.547]  And, of course, the very same bank robber is robbing us, but a percentage of Americans still think it's patriotic to kill people.
[01:17:49.887 --> 01:17:52.388]  They can't find the country on a map, but it sure feels good.
[01:17:52.408 --> 01:17:54.069]  You know, it sure feels good.
[01:17:55.089 --> 01:17:58.411]  We're gonna take calls when we come back with Dr. Paul Gregg Roberts, InfoWars.com.
[01:17:59.171 --> 01:18:08.496]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[01:18:08.696 --> 01:18:09.637]  My name is Crystal.
[01:18:10.017 --> 01:18:12.599]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:18:12.939 --> 01:18:16.561]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:18:16.901 --> 01:18:20.923]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:18:21.043 --> 01:18:21.864]  What did Crystal do?
[01:18:21.884 --> 01:18:24.305]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[01:18:25.826 --> 01:18:32.133]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[01:18:32.234 --> 01:18:35.858]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.
[01:18:36.078 --> 01:18:38.621]  Learn more at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5355.
[01:18:40.623 --> 01:18:41.143]  We're good to go.
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.302]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:03.584]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:19:03.684 --> 01:19:06.866]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:19:06.906 --> 01:19:11.650]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:19:12.011 --> 01:19:16.194]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:19:16.514 --> 01:19:18.877]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:19:18.977 --> 01:19:21.400]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:24.323]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:19:24.663 --> 01:19:32.252]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:19:32.592 --> 01:19:37.857]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:19:37.977 --> 01:19:40.779]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:19:40.839 --> 01:19:44.282]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:19:44.522 --> 01:19:45.463]  And I got news for you.
[01:19:45.603 --> 01:19:46.904]  You're everyone else.
[01:19:46.944 --> 01:19:47.925]  Invisible Empire.

[01:21:09.528 --> 01:21:15.530]  I tell you, we got like five, six people here making an Oklahoma City bombing film.
[01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:18.031]  And I've interviewed most of them in the past before.
[01:21:18.071 --> 01:21:18.872]  Great researchers.
[01:21:18.912 --> 01:21:22.233]  We'll try to get all three of them in here off and on.
[01:21:22.253 --> 01:21:28.855]  During the next hour that's coming up, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts will be with us for five minutes of the next hour.
[01:21:28.895 --> 01:21:29.656]  I want to get to Jeff.
[01:21:30.976 --> 01:21:46.662]  Damon, George, Kyle, Scott, while he's on with us in these next two short segments, but real fast, Dr. Paul Gregg-Roberts, what's your take on the Gulf oil spill, and the media being told they can't film or interview people, and federal felonies, and now the Coast Guard is our boss on land?
[01:21:46.702 --> 01:21:52.924]  It seems like any excuse government gets, it just stomps all over our rights, like Katrina with the gun confiscation.
[01:21:54.925 --> 01:21:55.345]  That's right.
[01:21:55.365 --> 01:21:57.506]  I mean, what else can you say about it?
[01:22:00.103 --> 01:22:02.866]  And what is going on that they don't want us to know?
[01:22:04.448 --> 01:22:05.309]  It's amazing.
[01:22:05.569 --> 01:22:06.410]  It's amazing.
[01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.950]  I don't know.
[01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:09.773]  I don't have any answer for that.
[01:22:09.913 --> 01:22:15.840]  I suppose they're just getting us used to accept illegal orders.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:19.784]  You know, it's like if you fly, you get searched without warrants.
[01:22:22.156 --> 01:22:25.658]  They're just getting us used to living in a police state, I suppose.
[01:22:26.238 --> 01:22:27.299]  I don't know what else it is.
[01:22:27.419 --> 01:22:27.959]  No, that's it.
[01:22:27.999 --> 01:22:28.700]  It's disgusting.
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:29.600]  We've got to say no.
[01:22:30.361 --> 01:22:32.022]  Let's talk to Jeff in New Hampshire.
[01:22:32.062 --> 01:22:32.702]  You're on the air.
[01:22:32.722 --> 01:22:33.323]  Thanks for holding.
[01:22:34.123 --> 01:22:34.643]  Hi, Alex.
[01:22:34.683 --> 01:22:35.204]  How you doing?
[01:22:35.224 --> 01:22:40.107]  I just want to say right off the bat that you are the voice of our founding fathers in the 21st century.
[01:22:41.268 --> 01:22:41.728]  Well, thank you.
[01:22:41.788 --> 01:22:42.668]  I try my best, sir.
[01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:43.289]  What's on your mind?
[01:22:43.973 --> 01:22:48.337]  Well, basically, you know, listening to you talk to Dr. Roberts, I had a question.
[01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:59.586]  You know, being someone who has been educated, you know, as a degree in history, I did a bit of research, and I found that the 16th Amendment wasn't properly ratified.
[01:22:59.666 --> 01:23:03.609]  I mean, here in New Hampshire, there's no record that the state even ratified it at all.
[01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:04.570]  No, I've looked into that.
[01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:05.831]  I mean, it really wasn't ratified.
[01:23:05.871 --> 01:23:10.255]  Another fraud, another hoax to give us the income tax, and we built this country without it.
[01:23:10.515 --> 01:23:11.796]  What's your question for Roberts?
[01:23:12.366 --> 01:23:29.052]  Well, what I'm wondering is, with the fact that our government is a business, and a business is there getting paid for their services, here's our government not acting in our best interest, where the 16th Amendment
[01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:34.976]  Is an illegal amendment, you know, because of Secretary of State Knox saying... Look, it's more than that.
[01:23:35.036 --> 01:23:36.517]  It's Declaration of Independence.
[01:23:36.537 --> 01:23:38.378]  We got an out-of-control, crook government.
[01:23:38.839 --> 01:23:39.700]  I appreciate your call.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:40.700]  What do we do about that?
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.282]  I mean, we have the Declaration of Independence.
[01:23:42.542 --> 01:23:43.623]  It's not just our right.
[01:23:43.663 --> 01:23:48.067]  It's our duty to remove this government and reform it as we see fit.
[01:23:48.647 --> 01:23:53.771]  But they've been quietly preparing to call us terrorists ahead of this collapse.
[01:23:53.811 --> 01:23:55.112]  They were getting ready for it.
[01:23:55.413 --> 01:23:56.774]  It's completely premeditated.
[01:24:00.489 --> 01:24:01.652]  I mean, what's your take on that?
[01:24:01.692 --> 01:24:04.679]  I mean, what do you do when you know you have a lawless government, Dr. Roberts?
[01:24:06.328 --> 01:24:13.250]  Well, you know, if you and I know we can't do much, we can try to tell other people before they arrest us.
[01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:17.611]  If everybody knew and didn't like it, then they could revoke.
[01:24:17.871 --> 01:24:20.191]  And I think that's where we are.
[01:24:20.211 --> 01:24:29.714]  If we want to get rid of this lawless government, it's not going to happen at the ballot box, and it's not going to happen because we get a third party or libertarians.
[01:24:31.274 --> 01:24:33.535]  If it happens at all, it's because people
[01:24:34.275 --> 01:24:37.077]  Catch on and do something about it.
[01:24:37.877 --> 01:24:45.241]  And by then, as you say, there may be too powerful a force to do anything about it.
[01:24:45.741 --> 01:24:49.323]  The caller is appealing to the law.
[01:24:49.483 --> 01:24:54.806]  He's saying, look, this income tax, it's not legal.
[01:24:54.846 --> 01:24:55.867]  It wasn't ratified.
[01:24:55.887 --> 01:24:57.388]  It's still unconstitutional.
[01:24:57.408 --> 01:25:00.349]  And yet we've had it for almost 100 years.
[01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:02.411]  And how can that be?
[01:25:05.697 --> 01:25:07.859]  We don't have any part of the Constitution.
[01:25:07.879 --> 01:25:08.999]  We don't have habeas corpus.
[01:25:11.081 --> 01:25:13.422]  You know, we have laws against torture.
[01:25:13.483 --> 01:25:14.223]  American laws.
[01:25:15.384 --> 01:25:16.585]  They're just the smallest.
[01:25:16.685 --> 01:25:18.386]  It's nothing new.
[01:25:18.426 --> 01:25:19.086]  No, I mean, that's it.
[01:25:19.127 --> 01:25:20.688]  We don't just have a corrupt government, folks.
[01:25:20.708 --> 01:25:27.072]  We have a premeditated, lawless criminal group that is breaking and violating laws to set precedents.
[01:25:27.572 --> 01:25:28.573]  They are dominating us.
[01:25:28.593 --> 01:25:31.595]  They are enforcing their will of evil upon us.
[01:25:31.996 --> 01:25:35.038]  Back in 70 seconds, we'll jam in a few more calls with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:25:36.246 --> 01:25:37.929]  We'll be right back.
[01:25:42.415 --> 01:25:46.401]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:49.310]  Listen up, folks.
[01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:50.111]  This is important.
[01:25:50.291 --> 01:25:51.091]  Alex Jones here.

[01:26:51.562 --> 01:26:53.465]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:53.945 --> 01:26:56.709]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:27:11.695 --> 01:27:14.877]  Okay, we're into the fourth and final hour.
[01:27:14.897 --> 01:27:25.045]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the best-selling author of The Tyranny of Good Intentions, former Wall Street Journal editor, father of Reaganomics, head of Policy, Department of Treasury under Reagan, is our guest.
[01:27:25.065 --> 01:27:27.066]  We're just jamming in a few calls here at the tail end.
[01:27:27.827 --> 01:27:31.289]  Damon in South Carolina, quick question or comment for Dr. Roberts.
[01:27:31.869 --> 01:27:32.210]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:33.651]  I have one comment, one question.
[01:27:33.671 --> 01:27:34.551]  I'll give the comment quick.
[01:27:34.591 --> 01:27:38.014]  I think one of the reasons why Iran is not really fighting back yet is
[01:27:38.993 --> 01:27:49.998]  At least some people, I'm sure, in the government have bought into the whole martyrdom situation and that if they are sacrificed, at least the rest of Islam and the world will rise up and avenge them, so to speak.
[01:27:50.038 --> 01:27:51.259]  That's one thought that I have.
[01:27:51.679 --> 01:27:52.699]  The question I have is this.
[01:27:52.759 --> 01:27:55.701]  My wife is from the former Soviet Union, the Republic of Belarus.
[01:27:56.541 --> 01:27:57.701]  And she tells me the story.
[01:27:57.741 --> 01:27:59.322]  I'm 37, she's 36.
[01:27:59.402 --> 01:28:13.226]  She tells me a story that when she was younger and perestroika happened and basically her parents' life savings went from having enough money to, you know, buy a lot to not enough money to even buy a bicycle almost overnight.
[01:28:13.266 --> 01:28:14.806]  I mean, it was a very short period of time.
[01:28:15.626 --> 01:28:17.787]  And my question to Dr. Roberts is,
[01:28:18.991 --> 01:28:30.394]  I thought about buying gold, but, you know, if you have what, you know, Roosevelt did or what our government did in the, you know, almost a century ago where, you know, you have a crisis and they come in and they start calling in all the gold.
[01:28:30.994 --> 01:28:32.895]  Well, you have to ignore that at that point.
[01:28:32.995 --> 01:28:34.475]  Nothing's bulletproof, nothing.
[01:28:34.495 --> 01:28:36.296]  I mean, you get in your car every day, you may die.
[01:28:36.616 --> 01:28:39.416]  It's the safest thing out there, history has shown, but nothing's safe.
[01:28:39.717 --> 01:28:41.017]  Dr. Roberts, comments on that?
[01:28:42.393 --> 01:28:43.134]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:28:43.154 --> 01:28:49.257]  In Roosevelt's days, the Americans were extremely gullible and even more naive than they are today.
[01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:51.819]  But there's always silver.
[01:28:52.099 --> 01:28:58.403]  You know, if you start going to a grocery store with gold, you'll have bad times around.
[01:28:58.443 --> 01:28:59.844]  You'll have trouble getting change.
[01:29:00.644 --> 01:29:04.467]  And you may find armed people waiting on you when you leave the store.
[01:29:06.901 --> 01:29:16.364]  I think everybody should have some sort of precious metal capability to see them through a period in which the money could be inflated away.
[01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:18.464]  Yeah, I mean, nothing's bulletproof.
[01:29:18.544 --> 01:29:19.965]  Nothing is a silver bullet.
[01:29:20.305 --> 01:29:22.825]  The closest thing to a silver bullet is silver, pun intended.
[01:29:23.466 --> 01:29:25.346]  But no, I mean, that's the point of this tyranny.
[01:29:25.686 --> 01:29:26.486]  Nothing is safe.
[01:29:26.807 --> 01:29:29.247]  The only thing that's safe is liberty and freedom.
[01:29:29.767 --> 01:29:31.568]  That's the engine of everything good, Damon.
[01:29:31.608 --> 01:29:32.328]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:32.628 --> 01:29:35.009]  George in Connecticut, last caller for Dr. Roberts.
[01:29:35.029 --> 01:29:35.369]  Go ahead.
[01:29:36.084 --> 01:29:36.605]  I don't know.
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:56.700]  I agree.
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:59.684]  The globalists have already moved their second base to China.
[01:29:59.724 --> 01:30:00.725]  That's a great point.
[01:30:00.745 --> 01:30:01.707]  Did you have a question?
[01:30:11.567 --> 01:30:17.473]  Yes, the question is, why doesn't Turkey maybe get in between the United States and say, look, you can't do this.
[01:30:17.553 --> 01:30:18.815]  The U.N.
[01:30:18.855 --> 01:30:19.756]  doesn't allow this.
[01:30:20.176 --> 01:30:21.457]  We didn't agree on this.
[01:30:21.577 --> 01:30:25.361]  Well, Turkey has now said if Israel doesn't apologize, they're breaking off ties.
[01:30:25.642 --> 01:30:26.082]  Good points.
[01:30:26.122 --> 01:30:27.484]  Let's get Dr. Roberts' take on that.
[01:30:28.607 --> 01:30:35.953]  Well, you know, Turkey's a NATO member, and so they're kind of got a foot in both camps.
[01:30:36.973 --> 01:30:42.798]  I think the Chinese may be betting that we will overreach and destroy ourselves.
[01:30:43.919 --> 01:30:51.925]  But they're taking an enormous risk, because if we don't, we intend to deny them access to energy.
[01:30:52.745 --> 01:30:56.048]  And so they should see that as a greater threat than they do.
[01:30:57.025 --> 01:30:57.605]  Well, that's right.
[01:30:57.625 --> 01:31:04.429]  They're encircling China, but then also allowing them to get oil, but to only buy it from the Western power bloc.
[01:31:04.970 --> 01:31:10.093]  And the stated policy is to encircle Russia and China, and down the road have a war with them.
[01:31:10.513 --> 01:31:17.818]  And I mean, how do these lunatic neocons that still run things sneak attack Russia, and now it comes out Cheney wanted to have nuclear war?
[01:31:18.158 --> 01:31:21.380]  I mean, these people are mentally ill at their foundation.
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:32.446]  Yes, when I was in Washington, in the government, and running around with big shots, the Neo-Conservatives, they very much desired to have a war with Russia.
[01:31:32.466 --> 01:31:42.211]  They wanted to defeat the Soviet Union militarily, and they got very angry when Reagan worked out a deal with Gorbachev and ended the Cold War.
[01:31:42.231 --> 01:31:43.591]  They just got very angry.
[01:31:43.651 --> 01:31:44.512]  They didn't like that.
[01:31:45.713 --> 01:31:46.234]  Amazing.
[01:31:46.534 --> 01:31:50.919]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, we've got to have you back on to talk about that piece of history that you witnessed in the future.
[01:31:50.959 --> 01:31:51.500]  God bless you.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:52.101]  Thanks for the time.
[01:31:53.382 --> 01:31:53.903]  Pleased to be with you.
[01:31:54.464 --> 01:31:54.844]  You bet.
[01:31:54.924 --> 01:31:55.105]  All right.
[01:31:55.125 --> 01:31:56.707]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:56.747 --> 01:31:57.287]  Stay with us.
[01:31:57.407 --> 01:31:58.369]  Got guests in studio.
[01:31:59.741 --> 01:32:05.463]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.

[01:32:48.455 --> 01:32:49.316]  fallofamerica.net
[01:32:58.066 --> 01:33:02.309]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:33:02.609 --> 01:33:02.890]  Number 1.
[01:33:03.530 --> 01:33:06.672]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:33:06.953 --> 01:33:07.513]  Number 2.
[01:33:07.813 --> 01:33:12.377]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:33:12.717 --> 01:33:13.157]  It's true.
[01:33:13.457 --> 01:33:18.021]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:33:18.321 --> 01:33:18.861]  Number 3.
[01:33:19.142 --> 01:33:22.444]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:33:22.744 --> 01:33:26.427]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:33:26.627 --> 01:33:26.887]  Number 4.
[01:33:27.428 --> 01:33:29.790]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:33:30.190 --> 01:33:33.574]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:33:33.874 --> 01:33:34.094]  Number 5.
[01:33:34.655 --> 01:33:38.578]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:33:38.818 --> 01:33:43.583]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:33:43.863 --> 01:33:47.888]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:34:21.927 --> 01:34:28.133]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[01:34:56.235 --> 01:34:56.656]  Thank you.
[01:34:59.137 --> 01:35:04.181]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:04.581 --> 01:35:06.803]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:35:09.707 --> 01:35:12.634]  We've got 52 minutes left in broadcast today.
[01:35:13.296 --> 01:35:14.017]  Wednesday, July 7, 2010.
[01:35:18.343 --> 01:35:34.915]  And I know that the Oklahoma City bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building was 15 years ago, but it's more important than ever because on all these television documentaries, they're invoking it again and saying that people that are against the New World Order and people that are against the federal government taking over in health care, they're terrorists.
[01:35:34.955 --> 01:35:36.115]  They're going to kill you.
[01:35:36.135 --> 01:35:38.077]  And Alex Jones wants violence.
[01:35:38.097 --> 01:35:41.019]  He wants to kill you when we actually call for the opposite.
[01:35:41.779 --> 01:35:44.161]  And so it's clear that they're getting ready to play that card.
[01:35:44.981 --> 01:35:49.724]  The Hitari, even seven months before they got busted, said they've got infiltrators in there.
[01:35:49.744 --> 01:35:50.744]  And it turned out they had two.
[01:35:50.804 --> 01:35:52.145]  The feds have covered up who they are.
[01:35:52.585 --> 01:36:00.770]  But I think the fact that people exposed that there were some fake arrests there with at least two of the nine people caused that trial to fall apart.
[01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:03.712]  And the judge said this was politically motivated and just a PR stunt.
[01:36:04.252 --> 01:36:05.113]  Kind of like Waco.
[01:36:05.173 --> 01:36:06.554]  Yeah, they were doing some weird stuff.
[01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:07.595]  Most of it exaggerated.
[01:36:07.615 --> 01:36:09.756]  They could have picked up Vernon Howe, a.k.a.
[01:36:09.776 --> 01:36:10.917]  David Koresh, any day.
[01:36:11.197 --> 01:36:15.120]  He went into town every day, had an auto parts repair shop two miles away.
[01:36:15.461 --> 01:36:19.264]  They wanted that big stunt, and that came out, of course, in the ATF documents.
[01:36:20.044 --> 01:36:23.545]  And then that really blew up in their face, so the feds bombed Oklahoma City.
[01:36:23.885 --> 01:36:30.127]  And the evidence is just a hundred percent in triplicate, up one side and down the other, that the feds bombed Oklahoma City.
[01:36:30.147 --> 01:36:32.848]  And people who work for the federal government need to realize that.
[01:36:33.228 --> 01:36:36.549]  None of you are safe, so we're going to be talking to some very interesting individuals.
[01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:38.750]  We've got two of them in here now.
[01:36:39.010 --> 01:36:48.954]  Towards the end, I may try to get one of the other fellows in here who I've interviewed before, who's got great connections and research between Oklahoma City 15 years ago and 9-11 nine years ago.
[01:36:49.255 --> 01:36:49.955]  So that's coming up.
[01:36:50.015 --> 01:36:53.376]  But in other news, this is the type of stuff that comes across my desk every day.
[01:36:54.157 --> 01:36:58.759]  This is out of the Korea Times, and it says, Can Good Emerge from BP Oil Spill?
[01:36:58.779 --> 01:37:00.680]  And this is by Kenneth Rogoff.
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:04.562]  And Rogoff was the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.
[01:37:05.242 --> 01:37:07.144]  Which is openly trying to set up world government.
[01:37:07.744 --> 01:37:18.293]  And he says, the fact that BP oil spill is on the cusp of becoming a political game changer of historic proportions, we may get a carbon tax, long advocated by a broad spectrum of economists.
[01:37:18.893 --> 01:37:24.158]  It is a generalized version of a gas tax that hits all forms of carbon emissions, including from coal and natural gas.
[01:37:24.198 --> 01:37:29.042]  In principle, one could create a cap-and-trade system of qualitative restrictions and accomplishments.
[01:37:29.542 --> 01:37:35.948]  Much the same thing, and it seems to be more palatable to politicians who will jump through hoops to avoid using the word tax.
[01:37:36.449 --> 01:37:43.936]  So the World Bank and the former IMF head, because it's one group, they're basically saying we're going to get a carbon tax out of that.
[01:37:44.016 --> 01:37:44.937]  Interesting little tidbit.
[01:37:45.357 --> 01:37:52.444]  But don't worry, we got thousands of emails with the heads of the UN program hiding the fact that the Earth's been cooling for 10 years.
[01:37:53.525 --> 01:38:11.670]  uh... stopped warming fifteen years ago because the sun cooling off UK inquiry finds emails do not undermine climate science UK inquiry finds emails do not undermine climate science and then of course we wrote months ago about this inquiry it's all headed up by top global warming globalist this is like having uh...
[01:38:14.071 --> 01:38:17.955]  Joseph Goebbels run the Nuremberg trials on Hitler.
[01:38:18.436 --> 01:38:21.539]  Or having Bugsy Siegel run the trial of Al Capone.
[01:38:22.159 --> 01:38:26.244]  Or having the Genoveses investigate the Gambinos.
[01:38:28.606 --> 01:38:29.187]  It's incredible.
[01:38:30.199 --> 01:38:32.181]  I mean, it's worse than the fox guarding the hen house.
[01:38:32.481 --> 01:38:35.423]  And we have a key article by Steve Watson up at prisonplanted.com.
[01:38:35.804 --> 01:38:37.685]  Climategate whitewash complete.
[01:38:38.046 --> 01:38:40.127]  Third inquiry clears everyone involved.
[01:38:40.548 --> 01:38:42.169]  And then we have our top stories today.
[01:38:42.209 --> 01:38:43.550]  They're up on GCNlive.com.
[01:38:45.552 --> 01:38:48.755]  That's GCN, the initials, GCNlive.com.
[01:38:49.015 --> 01:38:50.917]  That's the Genesis Network that syndicates this show.
[01:38:51.277 --> 01:38:54.980]  New York National Guard units scan vehicles for gun confiscations.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:03.428]  We have the Fox News clip there from the local news and photos of the gun searches and confiscations going on in America at GCNlive.com.
[01:39:04.088 --> 01:39:06.609]  And we also have some other reports up on GCNLive.com.
[01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:12.353]  Polish troops trained to take on American terrorists in our 25-minute video report.
[01:39:12.813 --> 01:39:16.315]  I sent two reporters for a week, two weeks ago, to Chicago.
[01:39:16.335 --> 01:39:17.495]  That report is now filed.
[01:39:17.836 --> 01:39:22.918]  Foreign troops training for gun confiscation on video and to take the American people on as terrorists.
[01:39:23.218 --> 01:39:25.420]  That's all up at GCNLive.com.
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:28.501]  So just unbelievably important information.
[01:39:28.841 --> 01:39:33.004]  Now for the balance of the hour, turning to guys who we could have on for 10 hours.
[01:39:33.584 --> 01:39:35.725]  And they have their own radio show on Rule of Law Radio.
[01:39:35.745 --> 01:39:39.386]  We'll give you that website before they leave us.
[01:39:39.846 --> 01:39:41.906]  They're James Lane and of course Chris Emery.
[01:39:42.567 --> 01:39:47.468]  And they're both filmmakers, researchers, some of the best research out there.
[01:39:47.908 --> 01:39:50.729]  And so I wanted both of them to just spend four or five minutes a piece
[01:39:51.369 --> 01:40:04.762]  Explaining why Oklahoma City is important, giving the basic facts, and then you had some nice government documents about Jolly and West, the admitted mind control head, MKUltra doctor, along with Ewing Cameron, being McVeigh's doctor throughout this whole thing.
[01:40:04.782 --> 01:40:10.087]  I mean, you can't, a science fiction writer couldn't come up with stuff this bizarre and in our face.
[01:40:10.987 --> 01:40:14.350]  So, Will, talk about that today and who you think McVeigh really was.
[01:40:14.931 --> 01:40:16.633]  So, Chris Emery, why don't you take it first?
[01:40:17.173 --> 01:40:18.436]  Well, thanks for having us on, Alex.
[01:40:19.437 --> 01:40:27.332]  The reason Oklahoma City is still relevant today is that it is a script that the federal government has followed for the last, I'd say, 35 years.
[01:40:28.173 --> 01:40:29.255]  And it's easy to see
[01:40:30.345 --> 01:40:38.391]  When an action comes up like 9-11 or these militia raids and so forth, you know, pretty much, you set up a clipboard and you know exactly what's going to happen.
[01:40:38.891 --> 01:40:45.536]  And even before I get into filmmaking and the truth movement, so to speak, or research on this, I was listening to your shows and I said, you know what?
[01:40:45.636 --> 01:40:46.176]  Alex is right.
[01:40:46.196 --> 01:40:47.057]  You hit all of the points.
[01:40:47.797 --> 01:40:49.738]  And it's easy to see how they do this.
[01:40:49.898 --> 01:40:50.938]  And they have no compunction.
[01:40:50.978 --> 01:40:51.838]  They're not embarrassed.
[01:40:51.858 --> 01:40:54.159]  They're actually very proud of the fact that they repeat these.
[01:40:54.319 --> 01:40:55.139]  And it's insidious.
[01:40:55.479 --> 01:40:56.820]  It doesn't get any worse than that.
[01:40:57.180 --> 01:40:58.100]  People need to wake up.
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:01.201]  And they need to know, not only Oklahoma City, but Waco.
[01:41:01.261 --> 01:41:03.722]  It's a consistent trail of events.
[01:41:04.062 --> 01:41:04.702]  And it gets worse.
[01:41:05.202 --> 01:41:06.783]  The body count is worse as it goes along.
[01:41:07.663 --> 01:41:12.010]  What we're trying to do with this film is bring out a lot of the information that people haven't been exposed to.
[01:41:12.611 --> 01:41:16.437]  James is going to elaborate on footage that has never been seen before, that has come our way.
[01:41:16.457 --> 01:41:17.378]  We're going to highlight that.
[01:41:17.399 --> 01:41:20.483]  You're interviewing Terence Yeagey's family about how they murdered him?
[01:41:20.503 --> 01:41:21.645]  I mean, you're getting all the interviews.
[01:41:21.886 --> 01:41:22.126]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:22.967 --> 01:41:33.952]  So, anyway, we want to bring a completely fresh perspective on this, information that has never been revealed before, and we are very grateful for having the opportunity to be on here to reveal this information.
[01:41:34.212 --> 01:41:35.113]  Oh, I'm glad to have you here.
[01:41:35.133 --> 01:41:37.814]  This was just an afterthought that you're here to interview me for the film.
[01:41:37.854 --> 01:41:38.795]  I'm honored to be part of that.
[01:41:39.215 --> 01:41:43.277]  But, I mean, get into just the... Let's say you had three minutes on national TV.
[01:41:45.478 --> 01:41:49.500]  What would you say to the public about Oklahoma City to get them to realize what really happened?
[01:41:50.239 --> 01:41:53.141]  Twelve people were involved that we know of, as many as eighteen.
[01:41:53.621 --> 01:41:57.664]  The scripted two perps and nobody else involved is complete bunk.
[01:41:58.145 --> 01:42:01.347]  That is a slap in the face to the victims' family members and survivors.
[01:42:01.767 --> 01:42:04.669]  People need to realize that we are going to expose information.
[01:42:05.069 --> 01:42:08.152]  We choose to remember the deaths of these people and the truth versus a lie.
[01:42:08.852 --> 01:42:16.020]  Uh, the second thing is that there was so many people, so much resources, there was more money spent covering up this case than actually investigating in the proper manner.
[01:42:16.421 --> 01:42:18.523]  The federal government actually went backwards.
[01:42:18.563 --> 01:42:27.032]  They did a complete U-turn on all of the ethics, all of the integrity, all of the resources, the professional, everything they had, they threw right out the window just to make sure that this was covered up.
[01:42:27.353 --> 01:42:29.936]  Because we know that there were actually assets, government assets.
[01:42:30.256 --> 01:42:35.730]  Both in the United States and elsewhere, overseas, that were involved in making sure that this thing came down.
[01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:39.258]  They were supposed to stop it at the last minute and it backfired right at their feet.
[01:42:40.404 --> 01:42:43.587]  Well, and that's what they always tell the mid-level people, is, oh, we're going to stop this.
[01:42:43.627 --> 01:42:55.736]  Just like in the first World Trade Center attack, right before Waco, I mean, they hired an Egyptian security agent, Ahmad Salam, had him cook a real bomb, and he's going, look, you're going to let the bombing go forward?
[01:42:55.776 --> 01:42:56.797]  He knew they were setting him up.
[01:42:56.897 --> 01:42:57.258]  Exactly.
[01:42:57.278 --> 01:43:02.242]  So he recorded them, and that came out in the New York Times and CBS, and they said, look, let it go ahead and happen.
[01:43:02.742 --> 01:43:02.862]  We're
[01:43:17.739 --> 01:43:23.705]  I think the one thing that stood out to me the most as I'm doing my research was the AMFO bomb, the story that it was AMFO that was used.
[01:43:24.046 --> 01:43:28.270]  The ammonium nitrate and fuel oil mixture would create a cloud of nitric gas.
[01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:34.356]  Well, we know because of the Terenshiki story that he was there within minutes of the bombing pulling Tom Hall out.
[01:43:35.177 --> 01:43:37.300]  Nobody had any problems with respiration.
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:39.422]  We know VZ Lawton, he was there, he's a survivor.
[01:43:39.642 --> 01:43:40.523]  Nobody smelled it.
[01:43:40.603 --> 01:43:43.345]  And of course, General Parton, the building blown out, not in.
[01:43:43.665 --> 01:43:43.865]  Right.
[01:43:44.085 --> 01:43:49.330]  And so, I mean, if it was Amfo, there would have been a huge nitric gas cloud over the building.
[01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:54.434]  And initially, the minutes after the bombing, the wind was blowing right into the building where VZ Lawton was.
[01:43:54.814 --> 01:43:55.855]  Nobody had any problems with that.
[01:43:56.155 --> 01:43:58.857]  So, I mean, that disproves that Amfo was used.
[01:43:59.197 --> 01:44:05.282]  We have evidence, the 40-year anniversary of a bombing in Madison, Wisconsin, is coming up this August.
[01:44:05.662 --> 01:44:07.604]  And 23 people were sent to the hospital
[01:44:08.144 --> 01:44:13.526]  After the first responders were sent to the hospital because they were overcome with the fumes.
[01:44:14.266 --> 01:44:17.087]  So we know that that's the pattern of it, and they expect us to believe this.
[01:44:17.687 --> 01:44:21.668]  It gets so cartoonish, it's almost like Wile E. Coyote tiptoeing in with the Acme bomb.
[01:44:21.988 --> 01:44:24.129]  And this is what they expect the American people to believe.
[01:44:24.329 --> 01:44:27.392]  Then we have the footage of them removing the other bombs that didn't go off.
[01:44:28.073 --> 01:44:32.098]  I mean, and parts of the building blown across the street, the opposite direction of the truck bomb.
[01:44:32.118 --> 01:44:38.926]  I mean, it just goes on, and then killing the cop that was exposing it, torturing him to death, and just, just, just, I mean, it goes on and on.
[01:44:39.366 --> 01:44:42.749]  Well, the story of Terrance Sheik, you mentioned the video that we did on that.
[01:44:43.269 --> 01:44:45.191]  We just thought it was important for that story to be told.
[01:44:45.231 --> 01:44:46.872]  I mean, that man was a real hero.
[01:44:46.932 --> 01:44:49.434]  He worked himself beyond exhaustion to save people that day.
[01:44:49.814 --> 01:44:53.017]  And he said that the official story was not how it happened.
[01:44:53.597 --> 01:44:56.279]  And, you know, I mean, he was concerned for his safety.
[01:44:56.319 --> 01:44:58.441]  Right before they tortured him to death, he thought he'd been poisoned, right?
[01:44:58.621 --> 01:45:05.083]  Yeah, he was sick, they were talking about getting him to the hospital, and I think to protect his family, he kind of isolated himself from them.
[01:45:05.463 --> 01:45:09.684]  And he was on the way to a meeting that morning, and he never made it.
[01:45:10.885 --> 01:45:12.225]  They found him tortured to death.
[01:45:12.245 --> 01:45:24.389]  Yeah, the rope burns, possible rope burns on the neck, the angle of the shot, he bled out in the car, supposedly walked a quarter of a mile after bleeding out, and then shot himself at a downward angle.
[01:45:24.409 --> 01:45:27.950]  You know, again, ruled suicide immediately, and it's absurd.
[01:45:28.690 --> 01:45:46.221]  The information that we're getting, Alex, you let us know how you're doing on a break, is that there are good members of law enforcement, local, county, state, and federal level that have come forward, either admitted their identity or wanted to be anonymous, and there's a consistent pattern of, okay, this is the information that makes sense, what the federal government and their
[01:45:46.701 --> 01:45:49.243]  Like you said, the cartoonish story simply can't hold its own.
[01:45:49.263 --> 01:45:51.185]  There is no factual foundation on it.
[01:45:51.285 --> 01:46:02.353]  So we go back and we say, okay, we're going to present the information that we know is factual, reams of documentation, every single thing that we're going to have on the film will have a bibliography, and there's going to be reference on all of that.
[01:46:02.373 --> 01:46:03.294]  So there's no question.
[01:46:03.774 --> 01:46:05.576]  And we're going to paint a completely different story.
[01:46:05.616 --> 01:46:07.157]  We need to get the truth out on this.
[01:46:07.457 --> 01:46:12.261]  People will have that as a foundation, just like a lot of your movies, to make a judgment call on what's going to happen in the future.
[01:46:12.501 --> 01:46:13.102]  They have to know.
[01:46:13.502 --> 01:46:21.892]  Well, then you've got the FBI coming and brandishing guns at Hoppy Heidelberg, the head grand juror's house, and telling him, you're not going to call these witnesses, you're going to shut up.
[01:46:21.952 --> 01:46:23.955]  I mean, you have the motive.
[01:46:24.015 --> 01:46:28.640]  I mean, Bill Clinton on Air Force One a year after the attack, they said, why did you get reelected?
[01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:29.742]  Your approval rating was way down.
[01:46:29.782 --> 01:46:30.462]  It went way back up.
[01:46:30.503 --> 01:46:32.104]  He said, Oklahoma City got me reelected.
[01:46:32.694 --> 01:46:34.975]  Well, I mean, that's why Hitler firebombed his own Reichstag.
[01:46:35.435 --> 01:46:39.476]  The whitewater documents were housed in the building for the whole investigation.
[01:46:40.177 --> 01:46:41.977]  He was going to go down like a lead balloon.
[01:46:41.997 --> 01:46:42.638]  It was unbelievable.
[01:46:42.738 --> 01:46:46.279]  May of that year, congressional hearings were going to take him down on a whitewater investigation.
[01:46:46.559 --> 01:46:48.480]  Let's fix this all in one shot.
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:54.622]  Blow that building, make sure there's kids inside, people love images of them, and get rid of them documents at the same time.
[01:46:54.882 --> 01:46:56.963]  We'll be right back.
[01:46:59.224 --> 01:47:01.525]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:47:01.605 --> 01:47:03.826]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:47:03.926 --> 01:47:06.728]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:47:07.128 --> 01:47:11.891]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:47:12.231 --> 01:47:16.433]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:47:16.753 --> 01:47:19.075]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:47:19.095 --> 01:47:21.638]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:47:21.978 --> 01:47:24.540]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:47:24.901 --> 01:47:32.508]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:47:32.828 --> 01:47:38.110]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:47:38.210 --> 01:47:40.511]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:47:40.531 --> 01:47:44.513]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:47:44.753 --> 01:47:45.693]  And I got news for you.
[01:47:45.833 --> 01:47:47.134]  You're everyone else.
[01:47:47.174 --> 01:47:48.174]  Invisible Empire.

[01:47:58.442 --> 01:48:08.171]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:48:08.451 --> 01:48:14.517]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:48:14.897 --> 01:48:23.745]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:48:24.125 --> 01:48:33.028]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:48:33.309 --> 01:48:37.890]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:39.471]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:49:03.057 --> 01:49:04.137]  Afraid to answer it?
[01:49:05.037 --> 01:49:06.478]  Afraid to answer your door?
[01:49:06.918 --> 01:49:11.999]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about ten times more than you would
[01:49:14.929 --> 01:49:15.169]  I think so.
[01:49:33.956 --> 01:49:34.376]  I think so.
[01:49:58.283 --> 01:49:59.024]  Listen up, folks.
[01:49:59.044 --> 01:49:59.824]  This is important.
[01:50:00.005 --> 01:50:00.825]  Alex Jones here.

[01:51:03.353 --> 01:51:10.459]  Alright, we're going to go right back to our guest in studio, listening on the radio out there on the AM and FM dial, Global Shortwave Satellite XM.
[01:51:10.799 --> 01:51:15.003]  You can also watch us live, streaming video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:15.063 --> 01:51:19.527]  Chris Emery, filmmaker, director, producer, living in Oklahoma City, known him for many years.
[01:51:20.067 --> 01:51:27.434]  And of course, James Lane, also doing great work, both making a Oklahoma City film set to come out in the winter of this year.
[01:51:27.754 --> 01:51:32.178]  Okay, you were going over incredible information about Jolly and West and other tidbits.
[01:51:32.558 --> 01:51:36.221]  Things that are documented on record, but are so bizarre.
[01:51:36.261 --> 01:51:37.582]  It's where truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:51:37.602 --> 01:51:38.003]  Get into it.
[01:51:38.103 --> 01:51:45.489]  We've got a researcher, Wendy Painting, that has been uncovering these documents and she's actually getting through information that the FBI hadn't even seen.
[01:51:45.689 --> 01:51:48.691]  It was actual records for the defense.
[01:51:49.452 --> 01:51:52.034]  And we've got a hold of Jolly West's resume.
[01:51:52.375 --> 01:51:56.118]  And I always... That's McVeigh's doctor from the time he gets arrested to his execution.
[01:51:56.178 --> 01:51:56.378]  Yes.
[01:51:57.419 --> 01:52:04.264]  And I always suspected that there was some link with, you know, mind control, psychological warfare.
[01:52:04.584 --> 01:52:09.507]  And sure enough, on the second page of his resume, we've got where he worked for the Tavistock Institute.
[01:52:09.748 --> 01:52:12.089]  Which is the top British mind control operation.
[01:52:12.430 --> 01:52:19.615]  And then, of course, he was in the MKUltra 77 hearings as the number two man in the world in the MKUltra program under Ewing Cameron.
[01:52:19.975 --> 01:52:20.075]  Right.
[01:52:20.456 --> 01:52:28.843]  And now this is, Tavistock Institute has direct links back to when the Fabians absorbed the National Socialist Science through Project Paperclip.
[01:52:29.644 --> 01:52:32.427]  So, I mean, this guy was really the inheritor of that knowledge.
[01:52:33.087 --> 01:52:37.391]  And now he goes in to the location there in El Reno.
[01:52:37.411 --> 01:52:40.294]  In fact, guys, do a document cam shot of this.
[01:52:41.195 --> 01:52:42.456]  I'll keep going.
[01:52:43.036 --> 01:52:43.477]  In El Reno.
[01:52:43.537 --> 01:52:45.599]  And what did the warden say there?
[01:52:46.107 --> 01:52:49.889]  Well, the warden says he runs a clean operation that was at the Federal Correctional Facility.
[01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:52.550]  A mile and a half from where Terry Iggy's body was found, by the way.
[01:52:53.151 --> 01:52:58.113]  And when he found out that there were hypodermic needles on McVeigh's trace, that's it.
[01:52:58.633 --> 01:53:01.315]  I do not allow drugs that allow paraphernalia.
[01:53:01.355 --> 01:53:02.035]  Nothing in my prison.
[01:53:02.055 --> 01:53:02.815]  What's going on here?
[01:53:02.915 --> 01:53:04.276]  Two weeks later, he was relieved.
[01:53:04.296 --> 01:53:05.677]  He was transferred to another facility.
[01:53:05.797 --> 01:53:12.800]  And that's how the Japanese created their mind control assassin ninjas was drugs and sex.
[01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:13.881]  But please continue.
[01:53:14.261 --> 01:53:21.307]  Well, uh, we see that, uh, they said that he was so drugged up, that McVeigh was so drugged up at that point that he would have admitted to assassinating Abraham Lincoln.
[01:53:21.327 --> 01:53:26.571]  Um, then, uh, Jolly West's protege, uh, took over after that, uh, Dr. John Smith.
[01:53:26.891 --> 01:53:30.313]  Now he is currently, uh, in, in psychiatric department at Guantanamo Bay.
[01:53:30.654 --> 01:53:36.798]  So again, these guys, uh, there's a constant... And they admit Guantanamo Bay has a CIA base on it where they do mind control study.
[01:53:37.039 --> 01:53:37.259]  Yeah.
[01:53:37.299 --> 01:53:38.720]  I mean, that's MSNBC.
[01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:39.160]  Yeah.
[01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:40.962]  Wow, man, this is amazing.
[01:53:41.702 --> 01:53:47.643]  And there's transcripts that show where Jolly West is talking about working with Jack Ruby.
[01:53:47.844 --> 01:53:49.164]  I mean, he goes back that far.
[01:53:50.204 --> 01:53:57.526]  You know, and the type of situation that Jack Ruby was going through and the mental stress that he dealt with and comparing that with McVeigh.
[01:53:57.906 --> 01:54:04.267]  McVeigh showed signs of post-traumatic stress, I'm sorry, Gulf War Syndrome prior to being deployed.
[01:54:05.348 --> 01:54:10.149]  Dental visits, I mean, just an enormous number of dental visits in the military.
[01:54:10.789 --> 01:54:12.331]  Uh, you know, that doesn't happen.
[01:54:12.572 --> 01:54:13.853]  What were they doing with this guy?
[01:54:13.873 --> 01:54:16.196]  Well, that's where they knock you out, you disappear a few days.
[01:54:16.897 --> 01:54:18.700]  And it's enough to pose solid questions.
[01:54:19.321 --> 01:54:26.530]  Well, the state police, when he got pulled over, they said he was just... Yeah, go over what a cop said of him.
[01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:27.351]  He was out of his gourd.
[01:54:28.574 --> 01:54:35.619]  He was surprised to see that McVeigh was packing heat and he had several magazines of rounds on himself and in the car.
[01:54:36.079 --> 01:54:40.162]  But the peculiar thing about Charlie Hanger, a lot of folks don't realize, it was his day off.
[01:54:40.662 --> 01:54:42.563]  He's 62 miles outside of his precinct.
[01:54:43.163 --> 01:54:45.365]  What in the world is Charlie Hanger doing zooming up I-35 going after
[01:54:47.746 --> 01:54:53.472]  In fact, he wasn't chasing anybody in particular, he was just cruising, and he stopped McVeigh for a speeding violation.
[01:54:53.892 --> 01:54:59.017]  And then to find out his tag was off, he wasn't registered, there was a lot of things that certainly posed a lot of questions.
[01:54:59.437 --> 01:55:01.219]  Number one, Charlie Hanger wasn't supposed to be there.
[01:55:01.699 --> 01:55:03.441]  So that's a huge red flag right there.
[01:55:03.461 --> 01:55:05.403]  No chemical residue on McVeigh at all?
[01:55:05.643 --> 01:55:06.684]  No explosive residue?
[01:55:06.704 --> 01:55:07.725]  They checked his ears?
[01:55:07.805 --> 01:55:08.726]  I mean, nothing.
[01:55:08.966 --> 01:55:14.149]  And of course, the Feds have grabbed all these surveillance tapes, and FBI agents told the LA Times they've seen them.
[01:55:14.409 --> 01:55:15.909]  It shows McVeigh with these other men.
[01:55:15.929 --> 01:55:18.471]  So the Feds have these tapes, but they're saying they don't exist.
[01:55:19.391 --> 01:55:22.433]  How many tapes did they copy over?
[01:55:22.493 --> 01:55:27.055]  580 tapes were actually copied and contracted for by the federal government.
[01:55:27.655 --> 01:55:29.877]  Uh, there were survivors that sued for 24.
[01:55:29.937 --> 01:55:32.219]  The FBI lied, said, well, they didn't exist.
[01:55:32.259 --> 01:55:34.881]  And they said, well, we lied, but here's another lie.
[01:55:35.302 --> 01:55:41.107]  So, out of 580 tapes, there were 120 of interest, which means they had three copies of 120 tapes.
[01:55:41.287 --> 01:55:43.389]  That's five times more than the original amount that they had.
[01:55:43.409 --> 01:55:44.930]  But the local news talked to the FBI agent.
[01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:46.531]  They say there's one from right over the truck.
[01:55:46.852 --> 01:55:49.334]  And you can see John Doe number two in McVeigh, big as Dallas.
[01:55:49.654 --> 01:55:59.886]  So, all of these things, this body of information literally comes at us by accident or by people that are conscientious, sitting on it for several years and they come and say, look, we need to get this out.
[01:55:59.946 --> 01:56:09.697]  What do you make of all these people that were in prison with him and Terry Nichols and others with these signed affidavits that McVeigh was like, yeah, I was in black ops, we were setting up militias?
[01:56:10.137 --> 01:56:11.278]  I mean that fits with the M.O.
[01:56:11.318 --> 01:56:11.638]  we had.
[01:56:30.670 --> 01:56:31.051]  Stay there.
[01:56:31.071 --> 01:56:32.091]  We got a long segment.
[01:56:32.111 --> 01:56:34.093]  I'm gonna try to quit injecting points there.
[01:56:34.133 --> 01:56:34.713]  There's so many.
[01:56:34.993 --> 01:56:36.655]  But let's go over who McVeigh was.
[01:56:36.695 --> 01:56:38.596]  Let's go over what's admitted.
[01:56:38.716 --> 01:56:43.600]  I mean, I mean, this guy and for all you black ops people out there, you know, they're gonna set you up too.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:44.340]  Okay?
[01:56:44.380 --> 01:56:45.421]  They enjoy burning you.
[01:56:45.721 --> 01:56:46.722]  Remember the MIAC report.
[01:56:46.762 --> 01:56:47.543]  They hate veterans.
[01:56:47.583 --> 01:56:48.343]  They hate cops.
[01:56:49.184 --> 01:56:50.085]  We're on the march.
[01:56:50.585 --> 01:56:52.206]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:56:53.127 --> 01:56:55.789]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:58.553 --> 01:57:00.855]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:57:00.935 --> 01:57:03.138]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:57:03.258 --> 01:57:06.000]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:57:06.461 --> 01:57:11.225]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:57:11.586 --> 01:57:15.770]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:18.411]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:57:18.431 --> 01:57:20.952]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:57:21.312 --> 01:57:23.873]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:57:24.214 --> 01:57:31.817]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:57:32.150 --> 01:57:37.393]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:57:37.554 --> 01:57:40.335]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:57:40.395 --> 01:57:43.838]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:57:44.098 --> 01:57:44.998]  And I got news for you.
[01:57:45.158 --> 01:57:46.459]  You're everyone else.
[01:57:46.499 --> 01:57:47.500]  Invisible Empire.

[01:58:58.187 --> 01:59:03.029]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:59:03.149 --> 01:59:03.930]  What have we got?
[01:59:04.150 --> 01:59:06.171]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:59:06.591 --> 01:59:10.175]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:59:10.255 --> 01:59:12.158]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:59:12.498 --> 01:59:14.420]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:15.802]  So they think they own our land?
[01:59:16.222 --> 01:59:17.343]  They think they own our water?
[01:59:17.544 --> 01:59:17.944]  Children?
[01:59:18.144 --> 01:59:18.925]  Our education?
[01:59:19.266 --> 01:59:19.886]  Our money?
[01:59:20.087 --> 01:59:23.751]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:59:24.111 --> 01:59:27.755]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:59:29.077 --> 01:59:29.898]  We have the facts.
[01:59:30.118 --> 01:59:31.219]  We have the Constitution.
[01:59:31.259 --> 01:59:32.160]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:33.001]  We have common law.
[01:59:33.061 --> 01:59:35.303]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:35.584 --> 01:59:39.368]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:59:39.468 --> 01:59:44.250]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:45.790]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:46.771]  Don't tread on me.

[02:00:10.569 --> 02:00:16.657]  We're going right back to our guest with this intriguing information here in just a moment.
[02:00:16.677 --> 02:00:19.180]  But first, I want to tell you about Pure Water Freedom.
[02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:21.402]  Purewaterfreedom.com.

[02:00:50.048 --> 02:00:54.932]  Or you can just trust the government and the hundreds of deadly chemicals they put in the water by design and not filter your water.
[02:00:55.492 --> 02:00:57.754]  Purewaterfreedom.com all made in the USA.
[02:01:14.908 --> 02:01:43.050]  about just you know all the bizarre things here in these FBI reports and and and now the affidavits and and all these witnesses and and McVeigh telling people yes I'm a government agent and one day this is all going to come out and then you see him on TV doing interviews just looks like he's bombed out of his mind looks like a complete drug addict on the side of the road and he's got the top mind control doctor living because Cameron had died by then Jolly and West there in you know shooting him up with this stuff I mean this is incredible
[02:01:43.803 --> 02:01:50.507]  Well, you know, if they would just show us the tapes, you know, there's how many tapes that Jesse Trinidou tried to get?
[02:01:50.947 --> 02:01:57.611]  Jesse had contacted myself and a couple other survivors, members of the bombing committee, and he says, what locations should we ask for the tapes?
[02:01:57.671 --> 02:01:58.411]  And we gave it to him.
[02:01:58.451 --> 02:02:07.136]  He went to the federal government, they obfuscated, they delayed, they gave him stuff of video footage of people walking in buildings two blocks away, had nothing to do with the Murrah building.
[02:02:07.176 --> 02:02:08.137]  We're good to go.
[02:02:37.296 --> 02:02:37.416]  Right.
[02:02:37.936 --> 02:02:40.837]  And that's why we're calling the documentary A Noble Lie.
[02:02:40.917 --> 02:02:46.118]  That's from Plato's The Republic, where it's the lie that the elite tell to maintain social harmony in their position.
[02:02:46.598 --> 02:02:52.840]  You know, because, I mean, it was just, again, it was so ridiculous, they just keep perpetuating this lie and expect people to believe it.
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:56.301]  I guess, you know, national security, it would be against social harmony.
[02:02:57.961 --> 02:03:01.143]  If they would just show us the tapes, you know, it would answer all the questions.
[02:03:01.183 --> 02:03:05.686]  It would answer the John Doe questions, you know, as far as who was in the truck.
[02:03:05.706 --> 02:03:08.889]  Let's go back, before we get into that, because we left off of that.
[02:03:08.989 --> 02:03:10.229]  Who is McVeigh?
[02:03:10.269 --> 02:03:12.951]  I mean, this guy disappears out of the military.
[02:03:12.991 --> 02:03:15.013]  He's showing up in all these militias all over the country.
[02:03:15.433 --> 02:03:18.055]  He's telling family I'm black ops infiltrating militias.
[02:03:18.435 --> 02:03:20.697]  He's telling others I'm bringing narcotics in for the government.
[02:03:21.468 --> 02:03:22.689]  He was a sharpshooter in the U.S.
[02:03:22.749 --> 02:03:24.650]  Army during the first Persian Gulf War.
[02:03:24.690 --> 02:03:31.714]  In fact, he was so good that he was on the security detail for General Schwarzkopf, which means you really have to get your numbers, accuracy and everything.
[02:03:32.094 --> 02:03:32.795]  And he was commended.
[02:03:33.295 --> 02:03:39.719]  Ironically enough, he was given a medal of commendation when he was in prison, actually, in the county jail in Denver awaiting trial.
[02:03:40.419 --> 02:03:41.220]  That's how good he was.
[02:03:41.260 --> 02:03:42.901]  The Army was obligated to give him that medal.
[02:03:43.746 --> 02:03:49.874]  After he got out, the FBI lost track of him for, what we know, at least four months, as long as six months.
[02:03:50.115 --> 02:03:58.366]  And that's when he turned up with the Bill Bean story, up in South Dakota, or North Dakota, at, let's see here, it was the National Guard Training Base.
[02:03:58.386 --> 02:03:59.988]  Yeah, where they actually train in explosives.
[02:04:00.849 --> 02:04:05.732]  And there's clear video of him at the explosives base a year after he supposedly got out of the military.
[02:04:32.970 --> 02:04:42.875]  It's one thing to ask McVeigh, it's the people that he actually surrounds himself with.
[02:04:42.976 --> 02:04:47.518]  Andreas Stroessmayer, national from West Germany, dad's number three with a home at Gold Administration.
[02:04:47.998 --> 02:04:48.979]  Traveling throughout the U.S.
[02:04:49.019 --> 02:04:54.061]  with an expired visa for four years, no gainful employment, all of his credit card bills are being paid for.
[02:04:54.442 --> 02:04:58.664]  Come to find out he actually had the passcode to the federal building in downtown Fort Worth.
[02:04:59.164 --> 02:05:03.387]  While he's trying to infiltrate these different militia groups, both in Texas and in Oklahoma.
[02:05:03.767 --> 02:05:08.430]  Four weeks before Oklahoma City bombing happened, he was literally kicked out of Texas by the militia groups.
[02:05:08.931 --> 02:05:15.935]  They actually scouted him going into the rear door of the federal courthouse, punching the keypad, the security keypad.
[02:05:16.095 --> 02:05:21.219]  24 hours later, they said, look, you got three days to get out of this state or else we can't guarantee your safety.
[02:05:21.259 --> 02:05:21.799]  Where does he go?
[02:05:21.899 --> 02:05:23.020]  Ellum City in Oklahoma.
[02:05:23.561 --> 02:05:24.101]  Unbelievable.
[02:05:24.241 --> 02:05:26.021]  And that's got the Southern Poverty Law Center running it.
[02:05:26.242 --> 02:05:26.702]  Absolutely.
[02:05:26.742 --> 02:05:28.202]  They're all over that, like white on rice.
[02:05:28.862 --> 02:05:31.183]  So, anyway, you wanted to talk about the tapes, I guess.
[02:05:31.243 --> 02:05:32.463]  We had other information on that.
[02:05:32.723 --> 02:05:34.084]  Well, no, we covered that.
[02:05:34.104 --> 02:05:38.885]  I mean, basically, they're just, if they just told us they caught on fire or something, it'd be at least more believable.
[02:05:38.905 --> 02:05:47.648]  But they just, you know, they're like, well, no, that all of the tapes, outside tapes, in all the separate buildings, through separate security systems, all changed their tapes at the same time.
[02:05:48.108 --> 02:05:49.148]  You know, it's absurd.
[02:05:49.468 --> 02:05:58.435]  But we have FBI agents who told the LA Times and others, because I have these articles, that they have seen the videos and it shows Tim McVeigh with John Doe No.
[02:05:58.455 --> 02:05:58.435]  2.
[02:05:58.635 --> 02:06:01.417]  Secret Service memorandum, actually two weeks after the bombing.
[02:06:01.477 --> 02:06:02.038]  It's right there.
[02:06:02.118 --> 02:06:05.881]  That was actually entered in the state trial for Terry Nichols in March of 2005.
[02:06:06.341 --> 02:06:09.584]  And Nichols has signed an affidavit saying that McVeigh was black ops.
[02:06:09.864 --> 02:06:10.064]  Yes.
[02:06:10.364 --> 02:06:11.685]  He has no reason to make this stuff up.
[02:06:11.745 --> 02:06:14.786]  Terry has everything to lose and nothing to gain by that claim.
[02:06:14.806 --> 02:06:16.286]  What about the new guy that I interviewed?
[02:06:16.306 --> 02:06:16.707]  I mean, he's not new.
[02:06:16.727 --> 02:06:19.808]  He's been around for years, but we were able to get the first interview in over a decade.
[02:06:22.429 --> 02:06:23.029]  Mr. Cooper.
[02:06:23.069 --> 02:06:28.251]  And he was saying that McVeigh basically told him the same thing.
[02:06:28.271 --> 02:06:31.052]  And they told him, we won't execute you if you'll just shut up.
[02:06:31.792 --> 02:06:32.532]  David Paul Hammer.
[02:06:32.852 --> 02:06:35.754]  Hammer, hammer, not good, yeah.
[02:06:35.874 --> 02:06:37.574]  There's some very good information to support that.
[02:06:37.635 --> 02:06:42.877]  Again, David has some solid info, and Wendy has been able to corroborate a lot of that.
[02:06:42.937 --> 02:06:54.902]  Yeah, and Chris was actually able to go out and scout some locations that was talked about in the book that there's no way that David Paul Hammer would have that knowledge of that, unless someone that was there told him about it.
[02:06:55.481 --> 02:07:02.205]  If I may preface this, Alex, before I decided to really jump feet first into this project, I took, in fact, Devin was with me, and we had a small film crew.
[02:07:02.225 --> 02:07:05.147]  We literally toured five miles around the crime scene.
[02:07:05.327 --> 02:07:08.069]  And we're trying to piece all of the stuff from the official story together.
[02:07:08.309 --> 02:07:09.150]  Didn't make any sense.
[02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:12.672]  Then we went back to what the committee had gathered in their 572-page report.
[02:07:12.832 --> 02:07:15.954]  The Oklahoma's Bombing Investigation Committee.
[02:07:16.135 --> 02:07:18.756]  OKCbombing.net, if you don't mind, we'll plug that.
[02:07:18.776 --> 02:07:19.817]  Yeah, led by Charles King.
[02:07:20.097 --> 02:07:20.557]  Unbelievable.
[02:07:20.577 --> 02:07:21.058]  State Rep.
[02:07:21.138 --> 02:07:28.784]  So we went through that book over a matter of about four weeks and we're looking at all of these locations and we're literally painting a mosaic of, yes, this does make sense.
[02:07:29.004 --> 02:07:35.769]  Physically, these guys, the 12 perps and the additional six, there may or may have not known that they're working for the government in various capacities.
[02:07:36.329 --> 02:07:38.371]  They were at these locations and it was a
[02:07:39.111 --> 02:07:42.773]  At least four different groups working together in concert to make this thing go off.
[02:07:42.873 --> 02:07:47.376]  It wasn't two lone nuts driving an Anfo truck in front of the Murrah Building.
[02:07:47.416 --> 02:07:47.756]  It's ludicrous.
[02:07:47.796 --> 02:07:54.760]  And how long would it take, you know, 30 minutes or more for them to drive from that park in Kansas to the location in Oklahoma City?
[02:07:55.160 --> 02:07:58.261]  And by that point, the ammonium nitrate fuel oil mixture goes inert.
[02:07:58.562 --> 02:08:00.623]  They would have to have stopped along the way and remixed it.
[02:08:01.043 --> 02:08:06.566]  The Arabs, these 3,000 plus brought in by George Bush Sr.
[02:08:06.606 --> 02:08:07.867]  and a couple thousand by Clinton,
[02:08:08.507 --> 02:08:12.671]  The media investigating them, claiming that they were connected in with some of these other people.
[02:08:13.091 --> 02:08:15.534]  From your deep research, is that a red herring?
[02:08:15.554 --> 02:08:23.101]  Because that looks like classic government ops, where they just have all sorts of other operations coming in at the same time to create a fog of war.
[02:08:23.441 --> 02:08:24.142]  Yes, it is.
[02:08:24.502 --> 02:08:27.285]  And there were actually stunt doubles of McVeigh that we know of.
[02:08:27.325 --> 02:08:28.926]  There were two teams that carried this thing off.
[02:08:29.427 --> 02:08:33.771]  One to actually do the dirty deed, and of course McVeigh and his useful idiots to take the fall.
[02:08:34.011 --> 02:08:36.273]  There were many concentric circles in play.
[02:08:36.873 --> 02:08:37.293]  Exactly.
[02:08:37.373 --> 02:08:39.695]  And of course, none of them know all of it.
[02:08:39.715 --> 02:08:43.337]  I mean, it's like the London, the 7-7 bombing.
[02:08:43.437 --> 02:08:46.740]  Clearly, if you research that, they hired these guys to be part of a drill.
[02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:47.540]  They had the drill.
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:51.723]  And they blew them up on board the bus and the train.
[02:08:51.783 --> 02:08:52.583]  Some of them got away.
[02:08:52.603 --> 02:08:57.026]  It was even in the news that Canary Wharf, the police machine gunned them, and just said, you didn't see that.
[02:08:57.407 --> 02:08:58.948]  I mean, it's so easy to do this stuff.
[02:08:59.748 --> 02:09:00.589]  It's amazing.
[02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:01.649]  They run the same script.
[02:09:01.730 --> 02:09:03.170]  And it's so disgusting.
[02:09:04.553 --> 02:09:06.518]  It's appalling to see how they pull this off.
[02:09:06.558 --> 02:09:08.403]  Continuing with the concentric team, sorry.
[02:09:09.461 --> 02:09:12.744]  Uh, we have, uh, basically the two teams downtown.
[02:09:12.764 --> 02:09:15.025]  Uh, there were at least, uh, twelve individuals.
[02:09:15.325 --> 02:09:21.510]  Uh, they were sighted as early as six o'clock that morning, actually running, jogging the route, the escape routes they were going to take.
[02:09:21.710 --> 02:09:31.577]  Well, at the same time, the Oklahoma, uh, bomb squad is at the courthouse across from the, uh, Murrow building, uh, looking for explosives, and they never found any there.
[02:09:32.117 --> 02:09:35.420]  That says, uh, reports, eyewitness reports saying that as early as, what, six a.m.? ?
[02:09:36.701 --> 02:09:37.001]  6.15 a.m.
[02:09:37.041 --> 02:09:46.650]  there was the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Department and the ATF actually doing a roadblock, a bottleneck, 10 blocks away checking vehicles for incendiary devices.
[02:09:46.791 --> 02:09:55.559]  What about the head of the FBI anti-terrorism crew lying and saying he was in Dallas and then got a flight but then later it was proven credit card receipts he was there days before?
[02:09:56.039 --> 02:09:58.522]  Danny Colson drove up at least 18 hours before.
[02:09:58.722 --> 02:10:01.265]  The credit card receipts at the Embassy Suites does corroborate that.
[02:10:01.325 --> 02:10:06.711]  So, we're not quite sure why he chose to, as they say, distort the truth, but that's his deal.
[02:10:06.751 --> 02:10:09.394]  So, credibility, right, it was gone.
[02:10:09.414 --> 02:10:10.995]  I can't believe anything he says.
[02:10:11.436 --> 02:10:17.783]  Ironically, Janet Reno removed him from the case four days after the bombing because he had basically turned and said, look,
[02:10:18.303 --> 02:10:19.484]  I show up for work every day.
[02:10:19.584 --> 02:10:20.905]  I'm supposed to do a good job on here.
[02:10:20.925 --> 02:10:22.787]  I want to investigate this case correctly.
[02:10:22.807 --> 02:10:24.748]  And she says, no, we don't need you on the team here.
[02:10:25.008 --> 02:10:26.950]  We're bringing in another team to completely corrupt this.
[02:10:27.210 --> 02:10:28.451]  What about ATF?
[02:10:28.931 --> 02:10:35.977]  Because you had some of the emergency crews saying ATF was there in bomb gear and in their raid gear saying, bandage me up.
[02:10:36.037 --> 02:10:36.918]  I was on the ninth floor.
[02:10:36.938 --> 02:10:41.401]  And they're like, everybody, it's on record that that thing was empty and they weren't on the ninth floor.
[02:10:41.441 --> 02:10:42.482]  The elevator was blown out.
[02:10:42.662 --> 02:10:43.042]  That's right.
[02:10:43.263 --> 02:10:43.723]  Exactly.
[02:10:43.763 --> 02:10:47.346]  In fact, it was Dr. Chumley that told these guys to take a flying leap.
[02:10:47.646 --> 02:10:49.307]  Tiffany Bible, she's a paramedic.
[02:10:49.668 --> 02:10:54.992]  She arrived four to five minutes after and she said that there were agents in full gear.
[02:10:56.173 --> 02:11:02.017]  And then you've got other witnesses saying that they overheard the ATF say, is this why we got the page not to come in today?
[02:11:02.338 --> 02:11:05.420]  So, I mean, there is an amount of evidence of foreknowledge.
[02:11:06.301 --> 02:11:10.344]  The FBI evacuation of the building, a separate building that morning,
[02:11:10.424 --> 02:11:16.126]  And it's because a very small part of the government's involved with foreign black ops and others that this does come out.
[02:11:16.146 --> 02:11:18.206]  People always say, well this stuff would come out if it was real.
[02:11:18.286 --> 02:11:18.927]  It did come out.
[02:11:19.107 --> 02:11:22.088]  Yes, and in fact it's out in full view right now.
[02:11:22.128 --> 02:11:24.548]  And that's why we're able to assemble all of the information.
[02:11:24.928 --> 02:11:29.590]  Folks, I can guarantee you right now, you have never heard, I'd say probably 70% of this has never been
[02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:38.360]  Well I'll tell you what, for your safety, I mean obviously the film's coming out in the winter and I can't wait to carry it at InfoWars.com and get it out to people.
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:48.512]  I know you guys are great researchers and have done a lot of original work, but for your own safety and for knowledge out there, I know you've already released some of this footage, it's so important, tell people some of the new developments you've discovered.
[02:11:50.173 --> 02:11:55.136]  We have over 10 hours of footage that hasn't been seen by the general public before, and over 1,000 photographs.
[02:11:55.856 --> 02:12:05.002]  We've got excellent footage of the crater, and it's completely offset from the large bite in the building, and as General Partin said, that the building...
[02:12:06.843 --> 02:12:09.285]  First bomb would have been around the third floor.
[02:12:09.605 --> 02:12:19.851]  Well, you can actually see, I mean, it's probably, you know, 30, 40 feet offset from the small crater where the car bomb was, and then the floors are actually concaved around the third floor.
[02:12:19.931 --> 02:12:23.694]  So you can see, and that was the biggest bite in the building, where it blasted that out.
[02:12:24.394 --> 02:12:30.598]  You had people said that they heard what sounded like a rifle shot, a high-powered rifle shot, which is
[02:12:32.299 --> 02:12:34.080]  It works the same way with the C4.
[02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:36.222]  It wouldn't have been as loud of an explosion.
[02:12:36.642 --> 02:12:40.925]  And that's where you hear all of the survivors talking about rubble coming down.
[02:12:41.165 --> 02:12:42.386]  People getting under their desks.
[02:12:42.446 --> 02:12:43.727]  They had time to get under their desks.
[02:12:43.767 --> 02:12:45.548]  And then the car bomb goes off outside.
[02:12:46.389 --> 02:12:47.910]  The bus tilts twice.
[02:12:48.130 --> 02:12:48.570]  Yes, twice.
[02:12:48.590 --> 02:12:49.371]  Six blocks away.
[02:12:49.551 --> 02:12:54.254]  Fourteen people were in that building, had enough wherewithal, the cognitive ability to take cover.
[02:12:54.474 --> 02:12:56.815]  That simply wouldn't have happened if they would have been hit.
[02:12:57.475 --> 02:12:59.116]  And you see the repeat with the Feds.
[02:12:59.156 --> 02:13:01.796]  They love to have their diversion.
[02:13:02.157 --> 02:13:09.179]  You know, the plane flies in, then the buildings blow up, and then no one notices the 47-story building not hit that falls in perfectly.
[02:13:09.679 --> 02:13:12.140]  We interviewed the guy who was the deputy head of emergency management.
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:13.240]  He says, yeah, there were bodies.
[02:13:13.260 --> 02:13:14.481]  You know, they blew it up.
[02:13:14.541 --> 02:13:15.821]  Then he dies mysteriously.
[02:13:16.742 --> 02:13:18.102]  But I mean, it's the same thing here.
[02:13:18.722 --> 02:13:23.584]  Real bombs go off, diversionary truck bomb, because the public's going to go, well, how did they get bombs inside?
[02:13:24.204 --> 02:13:27.668]  I mean, it's sick how their psychopathic brains work.
[02:13:28.089 --> 02:13:28.929]  It's criminology.
[02:13:28.970 --> 02:13:30.611]  They do the same stuff over and over again.
[02:13:30.932 --> 02:13:32.073]  And the lack of humanity.
[02:13:32.133 --> 02:13:34.536]  I mean, the children that were in the building.
[02:13:34.556 --> 02:13:35.337]  Well, it's a gambit.
[02:13:35.377 --> 02:13:38.460]  I mean, when you understand the military officer mind...
[02:13:39.241 --> 02:13:40.562]  And this goes back thousands of years.
[02:13:40.602 --> 02:13:41.202]  They write about it.
[02:13:41.222 --> 02:13:45.284]  Now, you know, let's say you're Alexander the Great or you're Julius Caesar or somebody else.
[02:13:45.664 --> 02:13:54.629]  If you send out a detachment of, say, 50 guys into a valley where you know an army is set, but you want to draw them out and see their numbers, you know your 50 guys are going to get cut off and killed.
[02:13:54.989 --> 02:14:00.252]  But now your argument is that'll save 100,000 of your main army because now you've gotten that intel.
[02:14:00.532 --> 02:14:01.452]  The ends justify the means.
[02:14:01.553 --> 02:14:02.953]  And so the ends justifies the means.
[02:14:03.193 --> 02:14:03.934]  The noble lie.
[02:14:04.334 --> 02:14:06.215]  And so America needs to take over.
[02:14:06.235 --> 02:14:07.275]  The Arabs are dangerous.
[02:14:07.295 --> 02:14:08.416]  We're going to blow these buildings.
[02:14:08.476 --> 02:14:13.839]  And we need a Pearl Harbor-level event, as the PNAC document said by the Vice President, to get this done.
[02:14:13.939 --> 02:14:15.439]  And it's the same thing in Oklahoma City.
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:17.420]  They've got their collectivist world government.
[02:14:17.821 --> 02:14:20.042]  All these states were moving to get out of the U.N.
[02:14:20.082 --> 02:14:21.382]  and to declare a 10th Amendment.
[02:14:21.763 --> 02:14:24.224]  Well, we'll just blow the hell out of this building and blame it on the patriots.
[02:14:24.244 --> 02:14:24.764]  And that's what they did.
[02:14:24.784 --> 02:14:28.266]  Within 10 minutes, Bill Clinton said, talk radio, Rush Limbaugh, it's your fault.
[02:14:28.686 --> 02:14:33.467]  You know, and they're already digging this back up to demonize the renewed patriot movement in this country.
[02:14:34.687 --> 02:14:48.250]  We've got a researcher, Kay Beach, who's going to talk about the MIAC report and the Department of Homeland Security right-wing extremism lexicon and how they use the Oklahoma City bombing to demonize the Tea Party.
[02:14:48.550 --> 02:14:53.471]  It's like, oh, if you believe in supporting the Constitution and you oppose tyranny, well, you're a McVeigh.
[02:14:53.711 --> 02:14:54.912]  You're one of those government haters.
[02:14:54.952 --> 02:14:56.152]  Oh, no, they say I'm a McVeigh.
[02:14:56.992 --> 02:15:02.897]  And boy, I tell you, the Southern Poverty Law Center and that Chris Matthews documentary, they call me by my first name.
[02:15:02.957 --> 02:15:06.640]  Oh, Alex, we're not saying he's going to cause violence, but his followers are.
[02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:11.503]  So now I guess I'm, I've never talked to these people, but they're on a first name basis.
[02:15:11.543 --> 02:15:15.747]  That's how much they're, because I know they don't like it that I talk about how they were running on Elohim City.
[02:15:16.167 --> 02:15:23.229]  Well, we were doing the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing press conference at the same time there was a tea party going on outside in Oklahoma City.
[02:15:23.609 --> 02:15:27.911]  And this is at the time that there was a lot of talk about militias again.
[02:15:28.311 --> 02:15:29.711]  And nobody was really even talking about it.
[02:15:29.731 --> 02:15:34.273]  They were talking about like a volunteer force to take over because all the National Guards deployed.
[02:15:34.793 --> 02:15:38.634]  And we, you know, we have a lot of natural disaster in Oklahoma and they wanted to have some volunteers ready to go in and help.
[02:15:39.034 --> 02:15:40.675]  And that's all that Charles... Civil defense.
[02:15:40.935 --> 02:15:44.516]  Yeah, 22 states have... Charles Key wants a militia to attack the government.
[02:15:44.776 --> 02:15:47.637]  And all of that information that came out was not on the tape.
[02:15:47.917 --> 02:15:48.977]  It was not in the interview.
[02:15:49.317 --> 02:15:53.518]  The editor took the reporter's story and completely fabricated all this stuff.
[02:15:53.558 --> 02:15:55.259]  Well, no, that's like Rand Paul.
[02:15:56.339 --> 02:16:00.160]  There's like a two-second delay and he's like, excuse me, yes, yes, I can hear you.
[02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:02.441]  Oh, you agree with getting rid of the Civil Rights Act.
[02:16:03.001 --> 02:16:03.541]  No, I don't.
[02:16:04.181 --> 02:16:06.742]  And then they ran the headline, he says, get rid of the Civil Rights Act.
[02:16:07.102 --> 02:16:08.383]  I mean, these are hoaxers.
[02:16:08.643 --> 02:16:08.823]  Sure.
[02:16:08.903 --> 02:16:10.024]  These are slime bags.
[02:16:10.044 --> 02:16:10.824]  These are crooks.
[02:16:11.344 --> 02:16:18.988]  And it makes you wonder what they're cooking up, because in the public mind, they're trying to link patriot movement to militias to violence.
[02:16:19.028 --> 02:16:19.488]  Muslims.
[02:16:19.688 --> 02:16:20.268]  Yeah.
[02:16:20.288 --> 02:16:24.070]  So now they're trying to say that the militias have linked up with Al-Qaeda.
[02:16:24.750 --> 02:16:30.812]  Can you believe those dirty American... I mean, yeah, the good old boys are working with Al-Qaeda when that's admitted CIA.
[02:16:30.852 --> 02:16:32.653]  I mean, folks, they're getting ready to set you up.
[02:16:33.013 --> 02:16:36.754]  The offshore banks know you're awake to what they've done and they're going to blow stuff up and blame it on you.
[02:16:37.094 --> 02:16:38.835]  Unless we trump them with the info.
[02:16:39.075 --> 02:16:40.616]  And let me tell you, this didn't 15 years ago.
[02:16:40.936 --> 02:16:42.696]  People know about false flag terror now.
[02:16:43.637 --> 02:16:44.697]  It has entered the lexicon.
[02:16:45.049 --> 02:16:50.316]  And that's why it's so important for this information to get out now, because again, they're using it to demonize the Renewed Patriot movement in this country.
[02:16:50.416 --> 02:16:51.217]  You guys better hurry.
[02:16:51.298 --> 02:16:58.728]  They could stage more stack attacks, more Oklahoma cities any day.
[02:17:00.325 --> 02:17:04.186]  What we'd like to ask the viewers is to keep an open mind when this movie comes out.
[02:17:04.406 --> 02:17:06.567]  And thanks in no small part to you, Alex.
[02:17:06.627 --> 02:17:08.828]  I mean, you were definitely the support over the years.
[02:17:09.068 --> 02:17:10.828]  You were the inspiration for us to continue on.
[02:17:10.848 --> 02:17:16.630]  There were many times that we wanted to set this aside because literally, cognitive and mentally, it was so overwhelming.
[02:17:16.770 --> 02:17:17.591]  It was so bad.
[02:17:17.651 --> 02:17:18.391]  It was so deep.
[02:17:18.431 --> 02:17:19.751]  It was so far down the rabbit hole.
[02:17:20.271 --> 02:17:25.213]  But... Well, when you know they're lying about that, then you start... Everything's a lie.
[02:17:25.453 --> 02:17:25.853]  Exactly.
[02:17:25.914 --> 02:17:27.375]  Well, that's why we want to get the truth out.
[02:17:27.415 --> 02:17:35.022]  I mean, I believe that bravery is contagious, you know, and I'm a member of We Are Change, and I really take that to heart, that we have to be the change that we want to see in the world.
[02:17:35.062 --> 02:17:36.023]  It's an internal process.
[02:17:36.303 --> 02:17:38.285]  We can change the outside by changing the inside.
[02:17:38.305 --> 02:17:38.925]  All right, stay there.
[02:17:38.985 --> 02:17:39.726]  Final five minutes.
[02:17:39.746 --> 02:17:44.070]  Let's talk about that on the other side, because if we don't expose Oklahoma City, we can't expose 9-11.
[02:17:44.711 --> 02:17:46.132]  We can't expose the Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:17:46.172 --> 02:17:47.853]  We can't expose these false flag events.
[02:17:48.094 --> 02:17:49.455]  They're using them to enslave us.
[02:17:49.795 --> 02:17:50.396]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:50.476 --> 02:17:51.236]  InfoWars.com.

[02:19:03.650 --> 02:19:04.571]  Tyranny is here.
[02:19:04.911 --> 02:19:08.472]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:19:08.852 --> 02:19:11.073]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:19:11.093 --> 02:19:16.536]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:19:16.936 --> 02:19:23.179]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:19:23.599 --> 02:19:29.160]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[02:19:33.761 --> 02:19:37.742]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[02:19:44.003 --> 02:19:46.884]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.

[02:20:07.201 --> 02:20:14.207]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about 10 times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[02:20:14.507 --> 02:20:16.549]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[02:20:16.729 --> 02:20:18.490]  They are expensive payment plans.
[02:20:18.751 --> 02:20:23.254]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment plan?
[02:20:23.595 --> 02:20:27.738]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed.

[02:21:00.891 --> 02:21:04.794]  All right, Aaron has worked on a 10-minute video that just went live with a story.
[02:21:05.834 --> 02:21:12.578]  Obama guilty of high treason, selling out sovereignty to Mexico with his suit against Arizona.
[02:21:12.619 --> 02:21:14.760]  Key video up on InfoWars.com.
[02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:16.841]  It's just now going up there right now.
[02:21:17.221 --> 02:21:17.742]  Look at this one.
[02:21:17.762 --> 02:21:19.963]  This is out of KDVR out of Denver, Colorado.
[02:21:20.423 --> 02:21:23.185]  Thieves could go free while victim faces jail time.
[02:21:23.525 --> 02:21:25.567]  Two illegal aliens were stealing his trailer.
[02:21:25.887 --> 02:21:26.988]  He ran out, told them to stop.
[02:21:27.948 --> 02:21:45.679]  He shot one of them who got injured and they're gonna be says he's gonna face life in jail and they're to be released Because basically they're illegal aliens and God so this is your criminal government ladies and gentlemen who wants to take your right to defend your life and property just like England does Holland Oh
[02:21:46.940 --> 02:21:50.564]  Vander Newhoff is a really interesting fellow who I've interviewed before.
[02:21:50.605 --> 02:21:54.950]  We'll have him back on when the film comes out, but he's done deep research and he's part of the film team.
[02:21:55.470 --> 02:22:00.897]  Holland, you've worked on the Oklahoma City connections to Oklahoma.
[02:22:00.937 --> 02:22:02.479]  Just real fast, rattle some of those off.
[02:22:02.819 --> 02:22:05.580]  Well, we have a lot of concrete connections.
[02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:08.981]  For one, Hussein Al-Husseini, who was named as John Doe No.
[02:22:09.001 --> 02:22:18.783]  2 by Jayna Davis at KFOR-TV in Oklahoma, filmed, named specifically by witnesses on the scene, as that was the man who was in the truck, Hussein Al-Husseini.
[02:22:19.243 --> 02:22:22.104]  He later works for Boston's Logan Airport on the day of 9-11.
[02:22:22.144 --> 02:22:22.944]  He was a baggage handler.
[02:22:23.304 --> 02:22:29.766]  And as I recall, two of the hijackers flew out of there, and that's where their luggage went through, and they found incriminating will, and so forth.
[02:22:30.266 --> 02:22:36.489]  And then you have like Melvin Lattimore, a man whose original credit cards were used in the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993.
[02:22:36.770 --> 02:22:42.332]  He was a known confederate of Tim McVeigh and friends of Tim McVeigh in 1995 before the bombing.
[02:22:42.753 --> 02:22:47.555]  And later on he was a roommate of the 20th hijacker, the 20th 9-11 hijacker.
[02:22:47.615 --> 02:22:52.858]  And the guy that got his head sawed off, he was in an airbase and loaned his laptop to one of the 9-11 hijackers.
[02:22:52.858 --> 02:23:04.772]  Well, he was on a bus in Oklahoma City and loaned his laptop to one of the hijackers who used it to email the 20th hijacker in Minnesota.
[02:23:05.092 --> 02:23:06.454]  But this was like in the year 2000.
[02:23:06.574 --> 02:23:09.237]  I mean, they didn't have wireless access on buses back then.
[02:23:09.557 --> 02:23:10.779]  I don't think they even have it now.
[02:23:10.799 --> 02:23:12.400]  The point is, this is a spy nest.
[02:23:12.941 --> 02:23:21.527]  So, I mean, there was at least one researcher who appeared before the 9-11 Commission to testify that Norman, Oklahoma was home to an Al-Qaeda cell prior to 9-11.
[02:23:21.567 --> 02:23:28.912]  Well, no one's ever been prosecuted or arrested in this cell, so obviously what was going on, there may have been some kind of logistics or support cell going on.
[02:23:29.312 --> 02:23:37.454]  But there were a lot of things going on, and the only way to view all of these events, World Trade Center 93, Oakland City, 9-11, is that they're not isolated.
[02:23:37.494 --> 02:23:38.074]  They are connected.
[02:23:38.114 --> 02:23:42.015]  They use some of the same people, they use the same SOPs, the same cover-up methods.
[02:23:42.456 --> 02:23:45.356]  They disregard the videotapes, the videotapes of the Pentagon.
[02:23:45.376 --> 02:23:47.237]  We've never seen a plane crashing into the Pentagon.
[02:23:48.557 --> 02:23:50.718]  We've never seen the videotapes of what happened in front of the Murrah Building.
[02:23:51.158 --> 02:23:55.019]  They wire a building, fly a plane in, wire a building, bomb a truck.
[02:23:55.239 --> 02:23:58.442]  It's not bad enough that they blow up a truck bomb outside a building or they fly a plane into a building.
[02:23:58.462 --> 02:24:01.606]  They've got to wire the building with explosives to increase the body count.
[02:24:01.626 --> 02:24:02.767]  It's the same SOP.
[02:24:03.208 --> 02:24:09.694]  And unless, and one of the points about this movie is unless we confront the people who are doing this, bring them to justice, this is going to keep on going.
[02:24:10.015 --> 02:24:12.237]  It's going to keep on happening and each time it's going to get worse.
[02:24:12.337 --> 02:24:13.498]  How did you get involved in this?
[02:24:14.822 --> 02:24:16.443]  Um, I'm from Oklahoma.
[02:24:16.463 --> 02:24:25.689]  I started researching the case, and I started doing some research on my own, putting out a hand-printed newsletter that I would hand out, and I met Chris Emery at an event where he's handing out copies of the final report.
[02:24:25.849 --> 02:24:26.769]  September of 05.
[02:24:26.829 --> 02:24:27.790]  We started to collaborate.
[02:24:27.990 --> 02:24:35.975]  We started collaborating at other conferences, truth conferences, low-power FM's, radio shows, and this is just another step in trying to expose the truth.
[02:24:36.055 --> 02:24:36.996]  It's been an honor.
[02:24:37.016 --> 02:24:42.539]  It's been, you know, this meeting Chris really set me on the path to finding the right thing to do here.
[02:24:42.639 --> 02:24:45.522]  And that's Holland O. Van Der Neuenhoff.
[02:24:45.542 --> 02:24:46.263]  Did I pronounce it right?
[02:24:46.283 --> 02:24:47.064]  Van Den Neuenhoff.
[02:24:47.204 --> 02:24:48.525]  Van Den Neuenhoff.
[02:24:48.545 --> 02:24:49.927]  I always get names wrong here.
[02:24:50.027 --> 02:24:50.527]  It's alright.
[02:24:51.048 --> 02:24:52.149]  Well, it's always good to have you on.
[02:24:52.169 --> 02:24:53.370]  I had you on, what, two, three years ago?
[02:24:53.390 --> 02:24:56.954]  About three or four years ago on when I posted one of my first articles about the connection between 9-11.
[02:24:56.974 --> 02:24:58.235]  Yeah, that was a good story.
[02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:05.004]  If I may, if we have a second, I want to give a special mention to Devin Winter, our director of photography and our production coordinator.
[02:25:05.205 --> 02:25:08.347]  Devin has actually followed a lot of your work for the last seven, eight years.
[02:25:08.687 --> 02:25:12.070]  He came on board with this film and he says, I'm in because I want the truth to come out.
[02:25:12.390 --> 02:25:15.653]  And he's actually done a lot of the commercial interviews for the official story.
[02:25:15.673 --> 02:25:17.334]  And he says, that doesn't hold water.
[02:25:17.354 --> 02:25:18.695]  He says, I want to come on board with your
[02:25:18.695 --> 02:25:19.255]  That's wonderful.
[02:25:19.275 --> 02:25:21.217]  We look forward to interviewing him when the film comes out.
[02:25:21.837 --> 02:25:27.781]  Because if they keep staging these terror attacks and blaming it on the Patriots, we're going to lose this war to defend America and save the Republic.
[02:25:28.082 --> 02:25:29.583]  Folks, most terrorism is staged.
[02:25:29.623 --> 02:25:31.384]  It's being used to enslave you and your family.
[02:25:31.684 --> 02:25:32.585]  Stand up and say no.
[02:25:32.865 --> 02:25:33.846]  Thanks for coming in, guys.
[02:25:34.506 --> 02:25:35.887]  Good job to the crew today.
[02:25:36.167 --> 02:25:37.488]  See you back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:25:37.528 --> 02:25:37.829]  Central.
