[00:00:01.271 --> 00:00:04.837]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:16.237]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, here in the third and fourth hour today.
[00:00:16.297 --> 00:00:22.342]  We are simulcasting in living video color in this multicast at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:41.138]  Now, I originally set James Dillingpole up for the show, London Telegraph writer, best-selling author, to talk about a Canadian study that came out that shows how many more times likely environmentalists are to be dishonest, to rob, to steal, and how they hate their fellow man.
[00:00:41.798 --> 00:00:53.565]  Now, anyone who's had their SUV's tires slashed here in Austin, or had their car dealership burned down in Denver, or had their home burned down in Los Angeles, knows how vicious these people are.
[00:00:53.625 --> 00:01:00.669]  They're a gang of thugs who use the moral excuse of hating their fellow man as an excuse to be collectivist.
[00:01:01.448 --> 00:01:07.290]  And it doesn't matter if it's the head of climatology at NASA saying we want to destroy the industrialized world.
[00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.830]  People live too well in the West.
[00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.731]  There's too many people in the third world.
[00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:17.293]  Their greenhouse gas taxes will conservatively kill a billion additional people in the first ten years of implementation.
[00:01:17.713 --> 00:01:21.554]  That is very conservative numbers from Lord Monckton, who's scientifically broken it down.
[00:01:23.493 --> 00:01:27.716]  This is the facts that we're talking about and this integrates into health care.
[00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:34.580]  But first we're going to talk to him about health care because he's also written about the nightmares of government-run health care in England.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.182]  Now listen, I don't need to talk to Mr. Dillingpole to know this.
[00:01:38.183 --> 00:01:43.166]  I've got Paul Watson, Steve Watson that work for us at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:44.967]  One lives in London, one in Sheffield.
[00:01:45.488 --> 00:01:47.889]  They've got insurance and it's a nightmare.
[00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.550]  Everybody has to wait.
[00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:51.011]  Everybody gets treated like trash.
[00:01:51.412 --> 00:01:52.713]  But I've seen Tony Blair
[00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:53.852]  Yes.
[00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:10.738]  Take it out and save her.
[00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:13.659]  90% of the time, she would have 100% recovery.
[00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:18.900]  But if you wait more than 6 months, almost 100% chance she'd die, and she did die.
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.541]  And Blair said, yes, that's too bad, we're working on that.
[00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:24.221]  He didn't even deny it.
[00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:26.142]  Why are Canadians coming here?
[00:02:26.602 --> 00:02:28.182]  Why are British coming here?
[00:02:28.602 --> 00:02:30.903]  Why are people from socialist nations coming here?
[00:02:31.926 --> 00:02:34.349]  Because free market gave us the best health care in the world.
[00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:39.535]  Government involvement in the last 35 years is what screwed up our health care.
[00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:41.878]  So we're going to get James Dillingpole's take on that.
[00:02:41.898 --> 00:02:44.461]  His website's jamesdillingpole.com.
[00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:46.163]  He's also a best-selling author.
[00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:49.667]  We'll tell you all about that before he leaves us.
[00:02:49.687 --> 00:02:51.649]  We're in a best-selling book on Obama.
[00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.532]  And it certainly turned out to be very, very accurate.
[00:02:54.552 --> 00:02:58.034]  It was released right as Obama got into office last year.
[00:02:58.074 --> 00:03:00.797]  But this isn't just James Dillingpole saying this.
[00:03:00.817 --> 00:03:03.959]  This is the National Post of Canada.
[00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:06.661]  Here's the London Guardian giving me a document cam shot.
[00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:10.044]  How going green may make you mean.
[00:03:10.344 --> 00:03:14.227]  Ethical consumers less likely to be kind and more likely to steal.
[00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:15.968]  Many times more likely.
[00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:20.312]  And the BBC even said, oh, the greenies are criminals.
[00:03:20.852 --> 00:03:21.472]  Dillingpole
[00:03:22.293 --> 00:03:28.320]  Had a tongue-in-cheek article, but very serious in the body.
[00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:34.186]  Well, remember what happened down in Latin America last month?
[00:03:35.187 --> 00:03:41.494]  You had a wife and husband kill themselves and then try to kill the baby because they were worried about global warming.
[00:03:43.484 --> 00:03:45.445]  In fact, here's a story out of the Telegraph.
[00:03:45.545 --> 00:03:47.126]  Liars, cheats, thieves.
[00:03:47.486 --> 00:03:49.987]  The terrible truth about the mean greens.
[00:03:50.887 --> 00:03:51.548]  Here's another one.
[00:03:51.728 --> 00:03:53.689]  Are green consumers more unethical?
[00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.731]  Look, these people, you go to a grocery store, the paper bags bust on you.
[00:04:00.051 --> 00:04:04.954]  I've read the statistics that they actually create more acid, more pulp, more energy used.
[00:04:05.294 --> 00:04:06.074]  Not that that matters.
[00:04:06.094 --> 00:04:06.754]  That's industry.
[00:04:06.794 --> 00:04:07.415]  It's renewable.
[00:04:08.235 --> 00:04:09.736]  The plastic is actually better.
[00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.615]  But they don't care, they will get in your face about it.
[00:04:14.215 --> 00:04:21.598]  These people want your house, they want your car, and if you go to Zilker Park, there's glass everywhere in Austin, just everywhere, all over the ground.
[00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:28.661]  Anyone that parts an SUV, it happened to us, gets it keyed, if you're lucky, normally windows locked out.
[00:04:29.693 --> 00:04:30.534]  Tire slashed.
[00:04:30.674 --> 00:04:31.154]  Hey, listen!
[00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:32.875]  I got three children.
[00:04:33.035 --> 00:04:33.796]  I got my wife.
[00:04:34.456 --> 00:04:41.542]  When my parents went someplace with us a few weeks ago, all of us, all seven of us, could ride in the car!
[00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:44.566]  But these little control freaks want to run our lives.
[00:04:44.586 --> 00:04:45.267]  Now, I'm ranting.
[00:04:45.547 --> 00:04:46.708]  I apologize to Dillingpole.
[00:04:46.728 --> 00:04:48.609]  We're going to get into this coming up.
[00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:57.015]  But first, I wanted to get into government-run health care and what it's really like from Airstrip One in this 1984 system.
[00:04:57.295 --> 00:04:58.656]  Mr. Dillingpole, good to have you with us.
[00:04:59.196 --> 00:05:00.717]  Thank you for having me back, Alex.
[00:05:01.238 --> 00:05:05.220]  Yes, so you want me to tell you about the British National Health Service experience?
[00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:07.462]  Well, it seems to me
[00:05:08.147 --> 00:05:13.671]  There are two ways of allocating scarce resources to do with health.
[00:05:13.812 --> 00:05:16.253]  One way is to do it through the market.
[00:05:16.634 --> 00:05:18.715]  If you pay, then you will get service.
[00:05:19.436 --> 00:05:24.500]  The other way, which is what we've got here in Britain, is a form of state rationing.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.045]  Now, maybe this way of allocating healthcare was appropriate immediately after the Second World War.
[00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:43.826]  But somehow I feel that the world has moved beyond the Second World War mentality where you're kind of grateful for what you get and you're happy to queue up for your rubbish service.
[00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:51.712]  The fact is that Britain has the lowest cancer survival rate in the G8.
[00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:55.795]  That in itself is a pretty grim indictment of our system.
[00:05:56.613 --> 00:06:03.178]  We also have, I don't know whether you follow this in America, we had the scandal of Stafford Hospital.
[00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:12.385]  The hospital where as many as 1,200 patients may have died because of government targets.
[00:06:12.545 --> 00:06:16.928]  Oh, I saw an article last week where the guy just showed up over three days and died on a gurney.
[00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:19.270]  Yeah, this sort of thing happens.
[00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:25.915]  At this particular hospital, patients were being left unwashed for up to a month.
[00:06:26.772 --> 00:06:29.995]  They were abandoned in their soiled, blood-stained sheets.
[00:06:30.536 --> 00:06:32.417]  The nurses weren't doing anything about it.
[00:06:32.457 --> 00:06:33.859]  They weren't giving them water.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.222]  Patients were crying out in pain.
[00:06:37.242 --> 00:06:44.388]  Now, I'm not saying that this is necessarily the common experience, you know, that everyone suffers every time they go into a National Health Service hospital.
[00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:51.054]  Sometimes you do get good treatment, and when you do, I mean, I burned my hand once, and
[00:06:53.177 --> 00:07:02.688]  After my three hours in a waiting room that made the Star Wars cantina scene look like Baywatch, eventually I got my treatment.
[00:07:02.708 --> 00:07:08.656]  But you do have to wait a very long time, and often the service you get is rather
[00:07:09.236 --> 00:07:09.716]  Grudging.
[00:07:09.836 --> 00:07:14.099]  Because, you know, you are treated as a supplicant, not as a paying customer.
[00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:17.961]  You are treated more or less like you don't really deserve to be there.
[00:07:18.061 --> 00:07:20.903]  Well, that's what Tom Daschle three years ago said in his book.
[00:07:21.183 --> 00:07:25.966]  We've been reading the quotes where we need to be like Europe, where old people know they have a duty to die.
[00:07:25.986 --> 00:07:28.808]  Yeah, the grass is always greener, isn't it?
[00:07:30.354 --> 00:07:38.201]  I mean, I do worry for America because I think, OK, so you've now adopted this new Obamacare system.
[00:07:38.962 --> 00:07:41.745]  It's going to cost you, A, an awful lot of money.
[00:07:42.618 --> 00:07:59.109]  And B, the moment you give big government a say in allocating healthcare, big government also feels it suddenly has the right to tell you how you should live your life, how much you drink, how fatty your food is.
[00:07:59.589 --> 00:08:06.614]  They're already saying $1,000 fines and jail time for salting your food in New York State.
[00:08:07.094 --> 00:08:09.976]  And I see them pushing similar things now in England.
[00:08:10.774 --> 00:08:12.435]  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
[00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:24.039]  We have this traffic light system now on our food in supermarkets whereby red means dangerous, amber means treat with caution, and green means go.
[00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:26.720]  It's safe and low in cholesterol and stuff.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.482]  And they're setting the precedent to literally run your life and tax certain foods more.
[00:08:31.502 --> 00:08:32.823]  I mean, they're openly saying this.
[00:08:33.323 --> 00:08:34.984]  Oh absolutely, there is no question about it.
[00:08:35.004 --> 00:09:02.663]  Because you see, once government starts spending money, I mean your money, let's not forget, when government starts spending your money on healthcare, it thinks that the best way of making the service cheaper and getting better value for money is not through the actual service it provides, but by spending a fortune on advertising and measures to forcing free individuals to behave in a way that conforms with the government's idea of health.
[00:09:03.323 --> 00:09:07.090]  So, you know, abnormal behaviour is not allowed anymore.
[00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:13.039]  You have to eat lettuce and live like a rabbit and not drink alcohol anymore and definitely not smoke.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.623]  Or you won't get the medical treatment that you've paid for.
[00:09:18.888 --> 00:09:35.047]  And that's why they love to collectivize things, because then they get all of the rabble that's on the dole angry at not just people with more money than them with class warfare, but now they're not just angry about the plastic bags or your big car, now they're looking at what you're ordering.
[00:09:35.512 --> 00:09:41.357]  Yeah, and of course the other thing you get is, I don't know how familiar you are with this, you're going to get lots of health tourism.
[00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:55.588]  I mean, the number of health tourists we get from the third world coming over here, sneaking into the system and, you know, getting treatment that they haven't paid for is, you know, it costs the British Exchequer a lot of money.
[00:09:56.349 --> 00:10:01.413]  So our service goes down and down and down and you have to wait longer and longer and longer for treatment.
[00:10:03.427 --> 00:10:05.608]  By the way, I just pulled this article up.
[00:10:05.848 --> 00:10:11.731]  I have seen scores of cases in Kansas City, but also at Walter Reed and another part of the country.
[00:10:11.771 --> 00:10:13.292]  In fact, here's the Washington Post.
[00:10:13.833 --> 00:10:15.714]  Pentagon is probing veterans' home.
[00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:23.418]  The Government Accountability Office warned the Pentagon this week that residents of a home may be at risk in light of allegations of severe health care problems.
[00:10:23.838 --> 00:10:29.581]  Residents have been admitted to Walter Reed Army Medical Center with the most serious type of pressure sores, and in one case,
[00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:30.642]  This is one of many.
[00:10:30.882 --> 00:10:41.831]  With maggots in a wound, a bunch of vets have died from a special type of fly that goes up into the nose and lays eggs in the mucous membrane and then they have a meal of your brain.
[00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:47.576]  So I guess we're getting screw worms now that we eradicated for cows now feasting on the vets.
[00:10:47.877 --> 00:10:52.761]  The one place where the government does run the health care and it's absolutely abhorrent.
[00:10:55.863 --> 00:10:58.225]  Yeah, well, I mean, welcome to our world.
[00:10:59.427 --> 00:11:03.431]  This is what it's been like for the last 50 years in Britain.
[00:11:03.451 --> 00:11:09.639]  You know, I mean, people in this country are very sentimental about the National Health Service.
[00:11:09.739 --> 00:11:11.501]  They see it as this free service and they
[00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:20.527]  And they look on America with horror, many people, and go, well, that's an awful place where, you know, if you get run over by a car, the first thing that happens is you get checked whether you've got medical insurance.
[00:11:20.948 --> 00:11:22.369]  Well, I mean, that's not quite fair, is it?
[00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:26.752]  I don't think anyone gets turned away and allowed to die by... No, that's asinine.
[00:11:26.772 --> 00:11:29.013]  You go directly to the emergency room, it's all free.
[00:11:29.334 --> 00:11:30.575]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:11:31.715 --> 00:11:35.218]  You know, I think, you know, you've opened the floodgates here.
[00:11:35.258 --> 00:11:37.760]  I don't know how much it's going to cost the American taxpayer.
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:44.863]  Well, James, stay there, because I want to talk to you about how it's enforced in England, because we all copy each other in tyranny.
[00:11:46.484 --> 00:11:54.608]  The worst aspects of each nation, the bureaucrats share it, but the IRS, 16 to 20,000 new employees, garnishing your wages.
[00:11:55.028 --> 00:11:56.609]  We'll be right back with James Dillingpole.
[00:11:59.384 --> 00:12:01.526]  RFID chips are becoming more and more common.
[00:12:01.886 --> 00:12:07.089]  Right now, there are hundreds of millions of new credit cards and passports that contain these tiny radios.
[00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.771]  How can you keep them from transmitting your information?
[00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:11.813]  Turn them off with ID Stronghold.
[00:12:12.073 --> 00:12:16.876]  Secure wallets and secure sleeves from ID Stronghold will block these radio signals.
[00:12:17.116 --> 00:12:18.757]  Visit IDStronghold.com or call 800-610-2770.
[00:12:18.857 --> 00:12:19.098]  That's 800-610-2770.
[00:12:19.118 --> 00:12:19.518]  IDStronghold.com.
[00:12:19.538 --> 00:12:20.579]  Protect your information.
[00:12:28.604 --> 00:12:30.105]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:12:30.225 --> 00:12:34.507]  Is your financial advisor experienced enough to combat rising interest rates, taxes, inflation?
[00:12:34.747 --> 00:12:38.829]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman of The International Forecaster.

[00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:50.155]  That's 877-479-8178.
[00:13:00.445 --> 00:13:04.111]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:13:04.472 --> 00:13:07.437]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:13:09.818 --> 00:13:12.479]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:13:12.499 --> 00:13:18.721]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:23.903]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:13:24.423 --> 00:13:34.067]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:13:34.187 --> 00:13:36.288]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:13:36.528 --> 00:13:37.849]  They're asking for more matches!

[00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.431]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.

[00:16:03.717 --> 00:16:19.882]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to dovetail the environmental population reduction movement in with the government health care, because they're on record saying, well, the case for killing Granny, the cover of Newsweek, shows an image of a plug pulled out of a wall and says, we got to get rid of old people.
[00:16:20.262 --> 00:16:21.482]  That's how we'll fix health care.
[00:16:21.962 --> 00:16:24.243]  So first they collectivize, then they start cutting.
[00:16:25.503 --> 00:16:26.044]  Massively.
[00:16:26.064 --> 00:16:29.345]  But you talked about hospitals where people for two, three weeks aren't given baths.
[00:16:29.785 --> 00:16:32.607]  Same thing with the VA where the government runs it.
[00:16:32.927 --> 00:16:34.688]  How do they enforce it in England?
[00:16:34.708 --> 00:16:37.089]  They just take the tax money with other taxes?
[00:16:37.149 --> 00:16:42.712]  Because here they're saying the IRS is now going to be our nanny and basically run our lives.
[00:16:43.427 --> 00:16:44.668]  Oh yeah, we have no choice.
[00:16:44.728 --> 00:16:52.396]  I mean, our tax burden has risen enormously in the last 12, 13 years under our socialist government.
[00:16:53.817 --> 00:16:58.422]  And they've spent more and more of our money on this creaking
[00:16:58.422 --> 00:16:59.163]  I think so.
[00:17:15.023 --> 00:17:18.525]  So the system has got, you know, this is socialism in action.
[00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:27.710]  You get bureaucrats paid for at taxpayer's expense and the system gets worse and worse and worse and you have no say in the matter.
[00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:34.053]  You know, you can't complain about the service you get because, as I said, you are treated like a supplicant, not like a customer.
[00:17:34.935 --> 00:17:47.554]  So you pay for it with tax money but that's not good enough and then third world populations pour in who are on the dole and don't even in many cases work and it gets more and more bankrupt.
[00:17:47.574 --> 00:17:50.659]  Where is this headed in England so we can get an idea of where it's headed here?
[00:17:51.637 --> 00:17:55.041]  Oh, I mean, you know, our country is going the way of Greece.
[00:17:55.221 --> 00:18:00.988]  We have a massive structural deficit, you know, running into billions of pounds.
[00:18:01.588 --> 00:18:07.975]  And our government is not faced up to the fact that it cannot afford to spend any more
[00:18:08.956 --> 00:18:25.230]  I mean, already the public sector of the economy has just overtaken the private sector, which means that, for obvious reasons, if you've got ordinary, hard-working businessmen and people
[00:18:25.811 --> 00:18:29.454]  Supporting more than 51% of the economy.
[00:18:29.774 --> 00:18:33.417]  You have a recipe for financial disaster and this is what's happening now.
[00:18:33.477 --> 00:18:34.738]  We can't afford the NHS.
[00:18:35.058 --> 00:18:37.960]  We can't afford anything really.
[00:18:38.761 --> 00:18:41.463]  We are a nation of bureaucrats.
[00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.171]  And the government's just getting started.
[00:18:45.351 --> 00:18:47.633]  They've got the snoops that dig through your trash.
[00:18:48.133 --> 00:18:48.853]  I saw headlines.
[00:18:48.873 --> 00:18:51.295]  They're recruiting seven-year-olds to report on their parents.
[00:18:51.315 --> 00:18:55.397]  They're making... Don't even get me started on the environment, you know.
[00:18:55.678 --> 00:19:04.403]  We have all three of our major political parties in Britain all singing from the same eco-fascist hymn sheet, you know.
[00:19:04.683 --> 00:19:06.204]  We must reduce carbon.
[00:19:06.244 --> 00:19:08.085]  We must put up more wind farms.
[00:19:08.385 --> 00:19:10.627]  We must, you know, we must do this, we must that.
[00:19:12.688 --> 00:19:27.857]  We are living in a topsy-turvy universe in which on the one hand our politicians are saying we must slash public spending, we can't afford to go on like this, and on the other they are talking about all these crazed schemes like carbon capture.
[00:19:28.157 --> 00:19:29.718]  Carbon capture does not work.
[00:19:30.258 --> 00:19:39.142]  They are talking about spending £4 billion on trying to create clean coal plants.
[00:19:39.482 --> 00:19:43.703]  Clean coal, carbon capture, burying carbon under carbon dioxide underneath the soil.
[00:19:44.444 --> 00:19:46.144]  Some American researchers have looked into this.
[00:19:46.524 --> 00:19:47.445]  It is not possible.
[00:19:47.685 --> 00:19:48.705]  It does not work.
[00:19:49.005 --> 00:19:55.808]  So that is called urinating £4 billion of taxpayers' money up against the
[00:19:56.088 --> 00:20:04.391]  Well, what about Australia, where they announced millions of acres of people's own land that they can't run sheep and cows on, and they just say that's the way it is?
[00:20:07.632 --> 00:20:08.392]  I know, I know.
[00:20:08.452 --> 00:20:15.754]  I know this is rather pandering to your listeners' view of the world, but I have to say I'm inclined to agree that we are seeing
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:25.267]  We have seen in the last decade, and is growing and growing and more and more, we are seeing the approach of one world government.
[00:20:25.447 --> 00:20:35.696]  All these different bureaucracies around the world, they are conspiring to take away our freedom, and I fear very much for what's going to happen in the next decade.
[00:20:35.716 --> 00:20:37.698]  I think unless we resist,
[00:20:38.318 --> 00:20:45.741]  More than a year ago, you published the book, Welcome to Obama Land, I Have Seen Your Future, and it doesn't work.
[00:21:00.262 --> 00:21:05.505]  I'm not even confident that Republicans, when they get into power in a couple years, won't repeal this.
[00:21:05.525 --> 00:21:10.888]  I mean, you talk about your big three parties, your Tories, they're all going along with it.
[00:21:10.908 --> 00:21:14.029]  It is one of the big problems.
[00:21:14.049 --> 00:21:20.292]  And I have to say, Alex, I am rather relying on you Americans to save our sorry asses, because you are our only hope.
[00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:22.294]  Well, James...
[00:21:41.289 --> 00:21:43.590]  I want to get into the mindset of these people.
[00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:48.373]  We have a psychological scientific study showing what a pack of pirate criminals they are.
[00:21:48.694 --> 00:21:48.974]  Stay there.
[00:21:48.994 --> 00:21:49.794]  We're on the march.
[00:21:50.295 --> 00:21:51.896]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:52.836 --> 00:21:55.498]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:58.305 --> 00:21:59.567]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:21:59.607 --> 00:22:04.953]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:22:05.193 --> 00:22:09.819]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:15.266]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:22:15.786 --> 00:22:20.487]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:22:21.007 --> 00:22:27.929]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:22:28.129 --> 00:22:29.029]  And here's the best part.
[00:22:29.229 --> 00:22:35.591]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[00:22:42.676 --> 00:22:45.418]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:22:45.919 --> 00:22:47.660]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.241]  What's your home worth?
[00:22:59.422 --> 00:23:01.344]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:23:01.524 --> 00:23:04.268]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.534]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[00:24:00.834 --> 00:24:06.602]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from efoodsdirect.com.

[00:24:15.114 --> 00:24:21.221]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[00:24:21.482 --> 00:24:23.444]  That's buy three, get one free.
[00:24:23.644 --> 00:24:26.368]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[00:24:26.548 --> 00:24:34.117]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.

[00:24:42.024 --> 00:24:47.169]  You've got to go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[00:24:47.189 --> 00:24:47.950]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.051]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[00:25:09.252 --> 00:25:11.434]  Alright, your phone calls are coming up in this hour.
[00:25:11.454 --> 00:25:13.977]  For the full next hour, I'm going to have open phones.
[00:25:14.017 --> 00:25:17.400]  I'm going to break down all the major facets of the health care bill.
[00:25:18.424 --> 00:25:20.305]  You've got friends and family that want to know what's really in it?
[00:25:20.325 --> 00:25:23.167]  We'll go over it step-by-step and break down every facet of it.
[00:25:23.427 --> 00:25:24.888]  But is it just the takeover of health care?
[00:25:25.328 --> 00:25:33.072]  The government's taking over every facet of our lives and has select big corporate interests behind it who want to vertically integrate the economy.
[00:25:33.152 --> 00:25:39.276]  This is a monopoly being formed, as the founder of the Rockefeller clan said, competition is a sin.
[00:25:39.296 --> 00:25:45.880]  Before we go back to James Dillingpole, author, best-selling author of Welcome to Obamaland, I've seen your future and it doesn't
[00:25:47.101 --> 00:25:52.864]  He also writes for the Telegraph, the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday, the Sunday Times, the Times, and the Independent.
[00:25:53.464 --> 00:25:54.485]  And we're very honored to have him.
[00:25:54.505 --> 00:25:56.406]  We're going to get into the mindset of these people.
[00:25:56.426 --> 00:26:10.374]  When I get up here and tell you that I've been to Smart Growth Conferences a decade ago, and I couldn't believe that they would laugh at me and say, of course we're robbing everybody off camera with all these big bankers and politicians and environmentalists.
[00:26:11.635 --> 00:26:17.776]  And that they hate everyone, and they're thieving control freaks who want an excuse to rob you, and they use guilt to control you.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:28.307]  This study, along with a lot of other research that's been done, proves, on average, these are a bunch of criminals who get well-meaning people to then let them run their lives.
[00:26:28.347 --> 00:26:29.147]  So that's coming up.
[00:26:29.948 --> 00:26:33.691]  I want to remind listeners, two new trailers are out for two new films.
[00:26:33.731 --> 00:26:35.292]  I've never released two films in one month.
[00:26:35.872 --> 00:26:40.076]  It just so happened that several of these films got behind schedule, so they were both ready in the month of April.
[00:26:40.116 --> 00:26:40.656]  They're done.
[00:26:41.196 --> 00:26:42.177]  They're being mass-produced.
[00:26:42.197 --> 00:26:43.238]  We should get them in next week.
[00:26:43.258 --> 00:26:43.939]  You can pre-order.
[00:26:45.019 --> 00:26:55.707]  The new film by Jason Burmess, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, How This Global Corporate Bureaucratic Banking System Works, incredible film, and Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:26:55.727 --> 00:26:58.149]  I haven't made a Police State film since.
[00:26:59.352 --> 00:27:17.158]  What, 2003, so seven and a half years, and this covers the entire police state grid, that Homeland Security's really set up for the American people, the actual FEMA camps and the government documents, the UN forces, how they want to use military against the American people.
[00:27:17.458 --> 00:27:18.759]  Be the first to get it on DVD.
[00:27:19.599 --> 00:27:23.662]  You can pre-order now and get discounts on them at InfoWars.com.
[00:27:24.002 --> 00:27:30.147]  Okay, James, I sidetracked you into the health care, but you are a guinea pig who's been living through this.
[00:27:30.207 --> 00:27:35.331]  But it does integrate and dovetail into the overall mindset of these people.
[00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:42.176]  In fact, I have articles here where they say, lowering our carbon footprint, destroying industry, will save the earth.
[00:27:42.476 --> 00:27:45.038]  And that we do need to reduce population.
[00:27:45.058 --> 00:27:48.380]  And then we have this Canadian prestigious study done.
[00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:58.865]  And again, here are the headlines, how going green may make you mean ethical consumers less likely to be kind and more likely to steal, massively more likely to steal.
[00:27:59.205 --> 00:28:04.607]  So that's the Guardian, who are basically made up of a lot of these people, admitting it.
[00:28:04.647 --> 00:28:09.549]  It's not just James Dillingpole writing about it, but James has been saying these very things
[00:28:10.109 --> 00:28:13.051]  For four or five years that I've been reading his columns since I've been aware of him.
[00:28:13.411 --> 00:28:15.512]  James, how did you know this about them?
[00:28:15.533 --> 00:28:17.654]  I guess you had the same experience as I did, but let's find out.
[00:28:18.014 --> 00:28:20.696]  And then, B, let's get into this study in detail.
[00:28:21.416 --> 00:28:25.179]  Well, I think, Alex, it all fits into the bigger picture.
[00:28:25.799 --> 00:28:29.141]  I think this rule doesn't just apply to Greens.
[00:28:29.762 --> 00:28:36.486]  It applies to Libtards, Marxists, Dukidas generally, people of the liberal left.
[00:28:37.066 --> 00:28:53.991]  Generally feel that because they vote for a form of government which involves wealth distribution, which involves government punishing the rich and making rules, they feel that is their moral get out of jail free.
[00:28:54.791 --> 00:28:59.234]  I think conservatives are much more honest about the facts of life.
[00:28:59.594 --> 00:29:02.396]  They believe much more in personal responsibility.
[00:29:02.777 --> 00:29:11.002]  And I think for that, because conservatives believe in personal responsibility, they hold themselves to higher standards of behavior than liberals.
[00:29:11.683 --> 00:29:13.204]  Does that gel with your experience?
[00:29:14.725 --> 00:29:16.686]  Absolutely, and I don't even call them liberals.
[00:29:17.066 --> 00:29:22.450]  It's a control freak cult who hates everyone and loves to run people's lives.
[00:29:27.483 --> 00:29:47.637]  Liberals have a, or call them what you will, watermelons, Marxists, whatever, they have a very depressing view of human nature, which is that we are all so essentially evil that the only way that we can be coerced into good behaviour is for the government to step in and rule our lives.
[00:29:48.017 --> 00:29:52.660]  And I think they include themselves, you know, subconsciously they think of themselves as
[00:29:54.281 --> 00:29:56.523]  Yeah, I think that's a good question.
[00:30:18.923 --> 00:30:19.724]  We're good to go.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.781]  Well it is, but expanding on that, I think it's even worse.
[00:30:41.801 --> 00:30:42.941]  Talking to these people
[00:30:59.184 --> 00:31:14.349]  They see themselves as powerless scum who never have any future, who are very envious and hateful, whereas a more libertarian or classical conservative has a high view of themselves and enjoys life and likes seeing others do well.
[00:31:14.369 --> 00:31:15.450]  I mean, that's how I am.
[00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.611]  I never thought of myself as some special good guy.
[00:31:18.931 --> 00:31:22.052]  This was just who I was and my parents and my culture.
[00:31:22.312 --> 00:31:27.436]  We spend our whole time being eaten up with envy about other people doing well, because we think, well that's how the system works.
[00:31:27.496 --> 00:31:31.800]  Some people do better than others, and normally it's through... Exactly!
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:36.204]  It's an envy-based thing, so they feel that they get power through the state.
[00:31:36.524 --> 00:31:39.427]  They feel like that it's their state, their government.
[00:31:40.107 --> 00:31:41.268]  It's an extension of them.
[00:31:41.328 --> 00:31:46.313]  They're living vicariously through Stalin, or through Obama, or through Mao.
[00:31:47.571 --> 00:31:47.931]  Absolutely.
[00:31:48.012 --> 00:31:58.265]  And I would say the very worst, the lowest of all vermin, I'm afraid to say, are the watermelons, the Marxists who've essentially moved into the Green movement and co-opted it for their own ends.
[00:31:58.705 --> 00:32:01.749]  Because I see, you know, I spend a lot of time arguing
[00:32:04.742 --> 00:32:15.212]  The majority of dark green eco-fascists that I have met is that they really do not care about nature and they loathe mankind.
[00:32:15.272 --> 00:32:19.616]  They are not in it to save the world, they are in it to punish the human species.
[00:32:20.196 --> 00:32:21.457]  We're good to go.
[00:32:46.792 --> 00:32:48.834]  Well, I mean, absolutely.
[00:32:48.874 --> 00:32:50.376]  I mean, it's not just Maury Strong.
[00:32:50.476 --> 00:32:51.517]  It's Pachari.
[00:32:51.598 --> 00:32:52.398]  It's the UN.
[00:32:52.459 --> 00:32:54.781]  It's the Biological Diversity Assessment 96.
[00:32:54.941 --> 00:32:58.626]  Let's not forget the WWF, who are very much part of this.
[00:32:58.906 --> 00:33:07.336]  Yeah, let's talk about the Nazi founder of that, Prince Bernhard, who then got caught using World Wildlife Fund cover
[00:33:08.577 --> 00:33:09.658]  In ivory sales.
[00:33:09.738 --> 00:33:15.304]  I mean, again, most of them don't consciously know this is a fraud.
[00:33:15.364 --> 00:33:18.648]  They consciously know that it's a eugenics movement.
[00:33:19.076 --> 00:33:20.477]  Well, it's riddled with it.
[00:33:20.537 --> 00:33:26.061]  And of course, Morris Strong, I think, is closely associated with the World Wildlife Fund.
[00:33:26.401 --> 00:33:34.286]  And you think about it, when I was growing up in the 1970s, I was very familiar with that cute little panda, you know, the panda motif.
[00:33:35.127 --> 00:33:46.515]  I think every child in the world is brought up to think of the World Wildlife Fund as this caring, sharing organisation which has nothing more than the world's best interests at heart.
[00:33:47.015 --> 00:33:50.999]  This is an organization whose income is currently what?
[00:33:51.019 --> 00:33:54.482]  It's about, I'd say about 300, no more than that.
[00:33:54.842 --> 00:33:56.944]  It must be about 400,000, 400 million pounds a year.
[00:33:56.984 --> 00:33:57.544]  So what's that?
[00:33:57.904 --> 00:33:59.846]  That's about 550 million dollars a year.
[00:33:59.866 --> 00:34:00.226]  More than that.
[00:34:00.246 --> 00:34:00.847]  It's about, it's about 650.
[00:34:06.972 --> 00:34:08.352]  There's nothing cuddly about the WWF?
[00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:37.995]  If carbon trading gets enforced by governments, if carbon regulation gets railroaded through by the likes of Obama, then the World Wildlife Fund stands to make $60 billion.
[00:34:41.111 --> 00:34:42.331]  Well let me expand on that.
[00:34:42.391 --> 00:34:47.252]  I keep going back to where I live and my up front, front row seat to this.
[00:35:03.004 --> 00:35:15.987]  Growing up, you know, in Austin since high school, every week, bang, bang, bang on the door, young environmentalist, gouging and shaming my mother into giving them money for SOS, Save Our Springs.
[00:35:16.327 --> 00:35:21.208]  Has nothing to do with Bull Creek and the spring-fed pool called Barton Springs.
[00:35:21.668 --> 00:35:29.870]  And the city of Austin stole more than 20,000 acres from citizens, paid them pennies on the dollar, and then all the local green leadership
[00:35:31.204 --> 00:35:37.169]  Literally did deals to basically sell at reduced prices or give themselves the land.
[00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:49.940]  They own their own banks and they're making hundreds of millions of dollars a year in the West Austin area where they stole all this land and now it's hotels and million-dollar homes and I mean...
[00:35:51.081 --> 00:35:54.344]  They are conscious thieves, and they know it.
[00:35:54.424 --> 00:35:58.267]  I mean, this is just... Look, there's nothing even green or liberal about them.
[00:35:58.608 --> 00:36:01.570]  It is a cloak for their authoritarian tyranny.
[00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:04.393]  This is a wrecking crew of hardcore criminals.
[00:36:04.793 --> 00:36:06.815]  Well, it's not like we didn't know Alex was there.
[00:36:06.875 --> 00:36:07.896]  Never trust a hippie.
[00:36:12.508 --> 00:36:16.177]  Well, you know, not only do they smell, but they also steal your money.
[00:36:16.457 --> 00:36:19.004]  And it was ever that.
[00:36:19.084 --> 00:36:21.530]  It's certainly been that case since at least Woodstock.
[00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:23.891]  Well, I want to expand on that, though.
[00:36:24.111 --> 00:36:31.734]  You got a lot of useful hippies that mean well, and they all got mad once the banks ripped them off and didn't turn it into a big park.
[00:36:32.014 --> 00:36:39.958]  They just hated the people that owned the property, but now they're even more mad, but they're not marched up to the front of the city council anymore and told they're angels.
[00:36:40.238 --> 00:36:42.979]  They've been, many of them, banned from even speaking in Austin.
[00:36:43.878 --> 00:36:46.440]  You could be living in California.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.803]  I mean, that truly is a green Marxist paradise, isn't it?
[00:36:51.403 --> 00:36:57.827]  You've only got a tiny bit of your state being taken over by the libtards, but poor California has just been completely wiped out by it.
[00:36:58.267 --> 00:37:03.490]  Yeah, the mayor of LA said a 28% increase in the first year on your power bill.
[00:37:04.071 --> 00:37:04.211]  Yeah.
[00:37:05.386 --> 00:37:22.536]  I think you may have to encourage California to succeed from the rest of America and allow it to go bankrupt and allow them to stew in their own juices and see the error of their ways and then, you know, get a proper governor in, a sort of Reagan-style governor who brings them back from the brink and
[00:37:22.996 --> 00:37:52.209]  But instead, James, California, as you know, well, the UN talks about this, tax havens, they want to make all the rest of the country like that, and they say, oh, this socialism will only work once no one can run, and that's what the New World Order is, is a globe run by these people where there's nowhere to run, because wherever the hard-working people go, that becomes a wonderful place, and wherever the parasites are, vampires can't feed on vampires.
[00:37:55.277 --> 00:37:56.778]  James, is your phone cut off?
[00:37:56.818 --> 00:38:02.182]  I was saying... No, no, no, I was saying vampires can't feed on vampires.
[00:38:02.582 --> 00:38:09.367]  No, I know, and who would have thought, who would have thought, you know, ten years ago that the only place in the world safe to flee to now is Canada.
[00:38:09.827 --> 00:38:14.931]  I mean, Canada is about the only country in the world which is not buying all this eco-fascist nonsense.
[00:38:15.666 --> 00:38:34.557]  And the reason is that they're sitting on loads of oil and they live in a country which is so cold that no way would any government get away with enforcing the kind of fuel bill hikes that we have to accept in the rest of the world because, you know, people can't afford to heat their homes.
[00:38:35.358 --> 00:38:44.334]  I'm afraid to say that America, Europe, even Australia is going down this greeny sinkhole.
[00:38:44.675 --> 00:38:46.277]  I'm not sure how we escape from this.
[00:38:47.574 --> 00:38:49.995]  Well, the good news is they've been exposed as frauds.
[00:38:50.075 --> 00:38:59.799]  Briefly, because you've been chronicling this, there's a new scandal every two or three days as big or bigger than the Climategate emails.
[00:39:00.079 --> 00:39:09.923]  And now, I was reading last week where they're, the UN's going to Hollywood saying, save us, no one believes us anymore, Obama can't get his bills.
[00:39:11.644 --> 00:39:11.884]  Yeah.
[00:39:12.304 --> 00:39:15.206]  No, I mean, but you know what really frightens me in all this, Alex?
[00:39:15.446 --> 00:39:35.075]  Okay, we've had the Climategate scandal and it had a lot of publicity and we've had, since we've had Amazongate and Glaciergate and PachauriGate and AfricaGate and HollandGate, all these revelations which show that the UN, the IPCC, has been lying to us constantly.
[00:39:35.135 --> 00:39:37.036]  You know, these scientists have been exaggerating the extent
[00:39:39.292 --> 00:39:39.572]  We're good.
[00:39:57.721 --> 00:40:12.654]  I'm hoping that one good thing will emerge out of Obamacare and that is that I'm hoping that it will strengthen the will of real conservatives in America to make this Obama's last success because the real battle is going to be fought
[00:40:16.855 --> 00:40:18.235]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:40:18.536 --> 00:40:39.181]  I mean, if people think government grabbing health care is bad and the IRS to enforce it, compared to the multi-thousand page bill that's already passed the House, home inspections, if you don't fix your house in one week, no judge, no jury, the government can just take your home, going to jail for light bulbs, batteries, trash inspectors,
[00:40:40.101 --> 00:40:50.331]  They mean business here, and if health care won't shut the economy down, then certainly this green power grab will.
[00:40:50.411 --> 00:40:53.894]  And I'm sure you saw the Audi commercials about the green police.
[00:40:54.334 --> 00:40:57.457]  The mayor of San Francisco, where that was produced, said, this isn't a joke.
[00:40:57.757 --> 00:40:58.919]  This is what we want to do.
[00:40:58.979 --> 00:41:01.521]  We want to turn hordes of authoritarians loose.
[00:41:03.823 --> 00:41:05.204]  America, this is my message to you.
[00:41:05.624 --> 00:41:12.530]  If you lose the battle on cap-and-trade, if cap-and-trade passes, the world is doomed.
[00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.011]  That is it.
[00:41:13.311 --> 00:41:16.974]  You've got to make sure that Obama is a one-term president, number one.
[00:41:17.375 --> 00:41:29.325]  And number two, you've got to make sure that the guy who replaces him, or girl, or maybe, does not buy into this watermelon nonsense, because it is going to be a disaster.
[00:41:29.645 --> 00:41:30.626]  Okay, but hold on.
[00:41:30.686 --> 00:41:42.377]  Gordon Brown, heading up the G20, says they're going to have a world constitution of banks, they're going to raise the money for climate taxes from the nations, unilaterally, outside of legislation, and that this is just the way it is.
[00:41:42.517 --> 00:41:43.438]  Obama agrees.
[00:41:43.838 --> 00:41:47.442]  What do we do when they just lawlessly do whatever they want?
[00:41:48.297 --> 00:41:53.979]  Well, I think what we have, at the moment at least, is the power of free speech.
[00:41:54.039 --> 00:42:02.822]  And I know that a lot of the ideas that are discussed on your show and discussed on the internet are very different from the kind of nonsense that our governments are conspiring to tell us.
[00:42:03.303 --> 00:42:04.183]  That gives me hope.
[00:42:04.903 --> 00:42:07.244]  Every day I get more and more emails from people
[00:42:07.244 --> 00:42:09.164]  People who understand the nature of the problem.
[00:42:09.564 --> 00:42:11.305]  We've just got to make our voices heard.
[00:42:11.325 --> 00:42:14.806]  I think the Tea Party movement has been a very important part of that.
[00:42:15.406 --> 00:42:17.126]  People are saying enough is enough.
[00:42:17.206 --> 00:42:23.827]  We don't like big government, whether it's being imposed on us in the name of conservatism or in the name of liberalism.
[00:42:23.907 --> 00:42:27.628]  I sometimes think that the big parties are all conspiring together.
[00:42:27.688 --> 00:42:29.829]  They all believe in big government and we don't.
[00:42:30.269 --> 00:42:30.869]  We're sick of it.
[00:42:30.909 --> 00:42:31.709]  We're sick of taxation.
[00:42:32.129 --> 00:42:34.911]  Well, of course, they're government bureaucrats and politicians.
[00:42:34.951 --> 00:42:37.253]  They get more power out of a bigger government.
[00:42:37.553 --> 00:42:37.954]  Stay there.
[00:42:38.014 --> 00:42:39.395]  Final segment with James Dillingpole.
[00:42:39.415 --> 00:42:41.596]  Then we're going to Annie, Brian, Don, James, Matt.
[00:42:42.177 --> 00:42:48.962]  A bunch of calls and I'm going to chronicle the entire health bill from top to bottom and boil it down.
[00:42:49.743 --> 00:42:53.826]  Also want to hear listeners' solutions to defeat this at the state level.
[00:42:53.846 --> 00:42:54.987]  James Dillingpole is our guest.
[00:42:55.327 --> 00:42:56.708]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:43:01.318 --> 00:43:07.001]  As the economy continues to decline, Patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[00:43:07.621 --> 00:43:09.462]  The world is changing fast.
[00:43:09.822 --> 00:43:11.303]  Are you fully prepared?
[00:43:12.083 --> 00:43:14.764]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[00:43:15.264 --> 00:43:25.549]  At PatriotFood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned meat for half price.
[00:43:25.989 --> 00:43:29.551]  And at SurvivalistSeeds.com, we now offer
[00:43:30.671 --> 00:43:36.653]  50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over 10,000 heirloom seeds.
[00:43:37.333 --> 00:43:41.594]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[00:43:42.194 --> 00:43:46.495]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[00:43:46.795 --> 00:43:49.156]  Food insurance, just in case.
[00:43:49.736 --> 00:43:54.357]  Owned by me, Vic John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[00:44:00.114 --> 00:44:03.777]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:44:04.137 --> 00:44:07.140]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:12.164]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:12.184 --> 00:44:14.026]  I have tremendous influence.
[00:44:14.631 --> 00:44:18.394]  ...on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:18.554 --> 00:44:23.578]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[00:44:23.758 --> 00:44:26.881]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:33.786]  A criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:44:33.866 --> 00:44:35.988]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:36.208 --> 00:44:37.549]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:37.809 --> 00:44:40.111]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:40.271 --> 00:44:42.112]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:42.392 --> 00:44:43.914]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[00:44:44.614 --> 00:44:47.155]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:44:59.059 --> 00:44:59.380]  Fact.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.960]  Four million people in the U.S.
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:02.781]  have Hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:45:03.101 --> 00:45:03.421]  Fact.
[00:45:03.621 --> 00:45:06.982]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:45:07.323 --> 00:45:07.643]  Fact.
[00:45:07.923 --> 00:45:13.245]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:45:13.445 --> 00:45:13.705]  Fact.
[00:45:14.065 --> 00:45:17.927]  One in ten Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:45:18.247 --> 00:45:22.590]  Fact, anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:42.500]  Don't wait to
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.701]  Final segment with James Dillingpole.
[00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:46.221]  I'm going right to your calls.
[00:46:06.496 --> 00:46:12.017]  Your anger, what areas of the bill you hate the most, or if somebody calls in who agrees with it, we'd love to hear from you.
[00:46:12.317 --> 00:46:13.318]  We don't screen your calls.
[00:46:13.338 --> 00:46:13.678]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:46:13.738 --> 00:46:18.499]  Ideas to beat this thing.
[00:46:18.519 --> 00:46:21.300]  The Democrats think you're going to forget about what's happened.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.280]  They've said this.
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:27.701]  And that they're going to incrementally put it into place so that you don't feel the pain.
[00:46:28.141 --> 00:46:29.362]  They know it was unpopular.
[00:46:29.402 --> 00:46:31.342]  Over 70% of the country in polls against it.
[00:46:31.742 --> 00:46:32.803]  They don't care.
[00:46:34.713 --> 00:46:42.171]  A lot of people are saying this has finally woken their eyes up, woken their eyes up, finally made them open their eyes and woken them up to...
[00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:46.932]  Be able to really understand that this is only the beginning.
[00:46:47.312 --> 00:46:48.973]  This is how tyranny works, James.
[00:46:49.033 --> 00:46:51.195]  I mean, you've studied tyranny, you've studied history.
[00:46:51.215 --> 00:47:03.883]  I was going to say, one book I read recently, I don't know whether you're familiar with it, a book by a Frenchman called Gustave Le Bon, The Crowd, it was called, A Study of the Popular Mind.
[00:47:03.903 --> 00:47:10.727]  And this book was written in 1895, and it was the first book to analyze the way a crowd thinks.
[00:47:11.567 --> 00:47:12.548]  And it was a big influence.
[00:47:14.387 --> 00:47:15.168]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:47:33.375 --> 00:47:39.238]  What you must do is repeat something over and over again until the crowd believes you.
[00:47:39.258 --> 00:47:42.039]  And this is what's happened with global warming, for example.
[00:47:42.419 --> 00:47:52.784]  We've got Al Gore with his propaganda movie, you know, An Inconvenient Truth, you know, his version of Triumph of the Will, where he says the science is settled.
[00:47:53.144 --> 00:48:03.028]  And if you repeat this soothing phrase over and over again, you know, the consensus says, 20,000 scientists say, you know, et cetera, et cetera, the world is heating up.
[00:48:03.388 --> 00:48:11.592]  What happens is that gradually this idea gets absorbed by the whole of society and people start thinking, yes, we must do something, we must act.
[00:48:12.398 --> 00:48:31.052]  What Gustave Le Bon also says is that there comes a point where the prestige of the demagogue who is spouting this nonsense, if that becomes threatened at any point, then his overthrow can happen very, very dramatically and very suddenly.
[00:48:31.433 --> 00:48:39.319]  And I think it is quite possible, the way people are understanding global warming now, the way listeners on your show, readers of my blog,
[00:48:39.979 --> 00:48:47.927]  I think we could be approaching this wonderful pivotal moment where we see Al Gore swinging from a lamppost.
[00:48:48.027 --> 00:48:48.667]  Absolutely!
[00:48:49.795 --> 00:48:51.515]  The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[00:48:51.755 --> 00:49:01.318]  And this is an all-or-nothing exercise by this criminal class of collectivists that are becoming fabulously wealthy and powerful from this.
[00:49:01.638 --> 00:49:03.358]  And that's why they're so dedicated.
[00:49:03.378 --> 00:49:04.839]  That's why they've invested so much.
[00:49:05.199 --> 00:49:06.199]  And they know the score.
[00:49:06.239 --> 00:49:09.600]  And we see their fraud falling like dominoes.
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:14.901]  So now they're trying to trust in the police state and apathy to carry them through.
[00:49:15.421 --> 00:49:16.882]  But no tyranny has ever stood.
[00:49:20.666 --> 00:49:23.568]  I think trading something like, you know, 10 cents at the moment.
[00:49:23.628 --> 00:49:27.169]  I mean, the carbon market has reached rock bottom.
[00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:40.857]  And of course, you know, you've got even the British Conservatives in government, the Conservatives who are about to become the next government, unfortunately, who are saying, yes, we must have a floor price on carbon in order to regulate the markets, blah, blah, blah.
[00:49:41.237 --> 00:49:47.160]  There are lots of people who are very – lots of rich, canny investors like Al Gore, like George Soros.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:48.120]  Shorting carbon!
[00:50:04.717 --> 00:50:09.940]  Yeah, well, people out there who are going to make money by betting that the carbon market is going to fail.
[00:50:10.621 --> 00:50:15.284]  You know, I think those are the people who I think are making the right call.
[00:50:15.784 --> 00:50:18.346]  I reckon that this thing, this whole thing is going to collapse.
[00:50:18.606 --> 00:50:24.009]  I do not think that they are going to be able to get away with imposing this global carbon tyranny on us all.
[00:50:24.289 --> 00:50:25.170]  That's what I'm praying for.
[00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:28.192]  James Dillingpole, thank you so much for spending time with us.

[00:51:00.249 --> 00:51:02.330]  There's a place down in Tennessee

[00:51:25.888 --> 00:51:26.709]  Others don't.
[00:51:27.129 --> 00:51:29.010]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:51:29.271 --> 00:51:30.792]  Diamond gusset jeans.

[00:51:51.172 --> 00:51:53.073]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:53.553 --> 00:51:56.495]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:02.158 --> 00:52:10.563]  This is the fourth and final hour, the day after the treasonous, treacherous act by the House of Representatives.
[00:52:10.583 --> 00:52:16.586]  The bill is a done deal, a formality in the Senate, going to Obama's desk very, very soon.
[00:52:16.706 --> 00:52:19.028]  I want to hear your outrage or your support.
[00:52:20.054 --> 00:52:23.317]  I want to hear folks' ideas to defeat this, to stop it.
[00:52:23.357 --> 00:52:33.107]  I'm going to take a bunch of calls right now, then I'm going to go over all the different facets and angles and a bunch of key points I want to make in this jam-packed final hour.
[00:52:33.287 --> 00:52:35.610]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:52:36.811 --> 00:52:43.497]  This is The Collectivist trying to make you dependent on them and seizing another giant section of the economy.
[00:52:44.491 --> 00:52:46.793]  And all the power and control that comes with it.
[00:52:47.614 --> 00:52:49.576]  Let's talk to Annie in Indiana.
[00:52:49.677 --> 00:52:50.617]  Annie, you're on the air.
[00:52:50.638 --> 00:52:52.179]  Hi, Alex.
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:53.040]  Hi.
[00:52:53.561 --> 00:52:57.745]  I'm a senior citizen, over 60, and I'm also a Texan in Indiana.
[00:52:59.006 --> 00:53:01.789]  I'm so old, I remember when you came on the air.
[00:53:04.072 --> 00:53:05.213]  That dates me, doesn't it?
[00:53:06.997 --> 00:53:15.442]  I'm familiar with some of the proposals in President Sotero's death care bill and I was going to ask you if you know if these carried over.
[00:53:15.502 --> 00:53:17.424]  I have no reason to believe that might have been taken out.
[00:53:17.444 --> 00:53:18.885]  I want to give you a quick scenario.
[00:53:18.905 --> 00:53:19.825]  Go ahead.
[00:53:20.225 --> 00:53:28.771]  Say I am over 60 and I'm in good health, have insurance, I'm hit in a car accident by an illegal drunk alien with no
[00:53:29.229 --> 00:53:33.671]  Health insurance, no car insurance that would provide me with any medical care.
[00:53:33.691 --> 00:53:35.392]  I have my own health insurance.
[00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:39.093]  I'm laying up with a broken body in the ER through no fault of my own.
[00:53:39.113 --> 00:53:42.755]  I have a broken leg and my face is smashed up and I need eye surgery.
[00:53:43.755 --> 00:53:53.259]  It's my understanding that at any age, if I am not current in my vaccinations, immunizations, including the swine flu shot,
[00:53:53.823 --> 00:53:56.864]  They did have specific areas in there previously.
[00:53:56.904 --> 00:54:06.306]  What they did was leave an open door to what they call comparative care, where with the big insurance companies and with the federal government, they will decide what care you get.
[00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:26.153]  And they use examples of, women below 45 don't need a mammogram.
[00:54:26.433 --> 00:54:29.514]  Or, you know, you don't get a colonoscopy until you're 50.
[00:54:30.675 --> 00:54:33.677]  And, you know, it sounds, you know, kind of...
[00:54:36.064 --> 00:54:36.885]  Non-threatening.
[00:54:37.225 --> 00:54:58.060]  But it gives them the power to do all this, and we know what Europe's done, we know what Tom Daschle said, how this should be implemented, that yes, they want to then let the bioethicist board decide that Annie doesn't really deserve all this extra care, that should go to somebody younger, and so they will be given liability protection.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:02.203]  And yes, there were provisions, I don't know if they were in the new one, I haven't had time to read the 2700 pages entirely,
[00:55:04.524 --> 00:55:08.245]  To where if you didn't have all your vaccinations and things, they could try to refuse your care.
[00:55:08.285 --> 00:55:08.645]  Go ahead.
[00:55:09.866 --> 00:55:19.148]  And might some of the insurance companies pick that up and say, gee, we'll have to cancel your private insurance if you're not current on your vaccinations under the new government guidelines.
[00:55:19.168 --> 00:55:27.490]  Yes, and there's also federal standardization in there to where the government says it's part of policy that you have to take an implantable chip while you're in the hospital.
[00:55:27.551 --> 00:55:28.311]  That is in the bill.
[00:55:28.351 --> 00:55:29.311]  I appreciate your call.
[00:55:29.351 --> 00:55:30.031]  Good point.
[00:55:30.651 --> 00:55:31.732]  Brian in Canada.
[00:55:31.772 --> 00:55:32.592]  Brian, you're on the air.
[00:55:33.558 --> 00:55:34.759]  Hello Alex Jones, how are you doing today?
[00:55:34.979 --> 00:55:35.719]  Good, thanks for holding.
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:42.204]  The reason I'm calling is because I have a solution to not only the health care bill, but many other things.
[00:55:43.164 --> 00:55:46.086]  And I want to share that with you today.
[00:55:46.787 --> 00:55:47.147]  Go ahead.
[00:55:48.088 --> 00:55:55.393]  The first thing I wanted to let people know is that there's been a lot of emotions stirred up through this recent passage of that bill yesterday.
[00:55:56.153 --> 00:55:58.335]  And I just wanted to say that it's time for calm.
[00:55:58.415 --> 00:55:59.255]  I wanted to say the Bible says,
[00:56:04.781 --> 00:56:08.724]  So, first of all, this is time for calm, not for getting violent.
[00:56:09.284 --> 00:56:09.725]  Well, wait!
[00:56:09.825 --> 00:56:16.810]  I mean, nobody's calling for violence here, but if your house is on fire, I mean, God says get up off your butt and get out of the house.
[00:56:17.602 --> 00:56:20.545]  Yeah, that's right, but on Facebook I have no... Get what verse that is!
[00:56:21.627 --> 00:56:22.307]  Go ahead.
[00:56:22.788 --> 00:56:33.160]  Okay, so what I've done is, on Friday, I was inspired to write a sample letter to Congressmen, and you are right when you say that the battle isn't within the states.
[00:56:33.681 --> 00:56:36.284]  It's not, I'm with the federal government anymore, it's with the states.
[00:56:36.997 --> 00:56:38.639]  That's where it will be won, I believe.
[00:56:39.479 --> 00:56:41.021]  Well, how long's your letter, Brian?
[00:56:41.882 --> 00:56:42.983]  There's five quick points.
[00:56:43.003 --> 00:56:44.904]  I don't have to read the whole thing, but I just wanted to... All right, we'll come back.
[00:56:44.945 --> 00:56:45.465]  Hit those quick.
[00:56:45.525 --> 00:56:47.767]  I want to get to Don, Matt, Damon, and others.
[00:56:47.787 --> 00:56:48.488]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:56:49.028 --> 00:56:51.811]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:56:52.071 --> 00:56:55.514]  Don't forget, two new trailers for two new films coming out in April.
[00:56:55.815 --> 00:56:57.376]  Watch them at InfoWars.com.
[00:56:57.396 --> 00:56:57.997]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:59.406 --> 00:57:03.047]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:57:03.427 --> 00:57:06.428]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:57:06.668 --> 00:57:11.449]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:57:11.469 --> 00:57:17.691]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:57:17.851 --> 00:57:20.092]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:57:20.612 --> 00:57:20.932]  Tim Geithner?
[00:57:20.952 --> 00:57:21.372]  Bernanke?
[00:57:21.453 --> 00:57:22.053]  They're arsonists!
[00:57:22.113 --> 00:57:22.773]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:57:22.793 --> 00:57:24.914]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:57:39.542 --> 00:57:46.510]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.

[00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:03.431]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:03.751 --> 00:58:11.873]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:16.675]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:58:17.255 --> 00:58:28.058]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:58:28.698 --> 00:58:37.700]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:43.261]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:58:43.642 --> 00:58:50.823]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:51.123 --> 00:58:53.864]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:58:58.539 --> 00:59:00.361]  The end is near.
[00:59:01.242 --> 00:59:03.184]  No, this is not a New Age prophecy.
[00:59:03.404 --> 00:59:04.225]  I'm Steve Schenck.
[00:59:04.625 --> 00:59:11.953]  Alex and I told you two weeks ago about the Buy 3 Get 1 Free production special that eFoods Direct is running on the
[00:59:14.706 --> 00:59:22.568]  Get your order in by Monday, March 22nd or lose out on the best delicious, storable, easy fix food deal on the planet.
[00:59:22.928 --> 00:59:30.730]  On Monday, March 22nd at 1159 p.m., the countdown clock will shut down for orders of the buy three, get one free special.
[00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:37.852]  Those wise enough to get their orders in before the deadline will get one free for every three they buy of the special items.
[00:59:39.923 --> 00:59:43.124]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:43.164 --> 00:59:45.164]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:07.847 --> 01:00:18.336]  I've done a lot of research on all five versions, and I'm not going to lie to you, I haven't read all 2,700 pages, but I've listened to all the debate, researched it, scanned through it.
[01:00:18.976 --> 01:00:23.960]  This is the worst bill of the five.
[01:00:25.001 --> 01:00:26.523]  Some would say, well wait, it's a better bill.
[01:00:26.603 --> 01:00:27.804]  It doesn't have a public option.
[01:00:28.204 --> 01:00:32.808]  If you're going to have socialism and steal from one group, you might as well actually give the money to somebody.
[01:00:34.392 --> 01:00:34.592]  No.
[01:00:35.053 --> 01:00:46.187]  The top insurance companies, not the little ones, the top ones, and it's in Bloomberg today, their stock's going up, they're set to make massive profits because the government's giving them liability protection.
[01:00:46.227 --> 01:00:49.811]  It lets them lower the standard of everybody's care, just like in England and Europe.
[01:00:50.111 --> 01:00:51.052]  We know how this works.
[01:00:52.239 --> 01:00:54.160]  And it gives the illegal aliens the health care.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.881]  It will further destroy the economy.
[01:00:55.961 --> 01:00:58.402]  I'm going to go over all of it today.
[01:00:58.522 --> 01:01:03.284]  But Dennis Kucinich was right a few months ago when he said, this is an insurance company bailout.
[01:01:03.764 --> 01:01:04.564]  So was Howard Dean.
[01:01:04.604 --> 01:01:05.545]  But they rolled over.
[01:01:05.785 --> 01:01:08.126]  Now I was against their plan as well.
[01:01:08.446 --> 01:01:11.167]  But at least they were honest about this plan being a scam.
[01:01:11.207 --> 01:01:12.548]  Now, I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:13.408]  I want to hear from you.
[01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:14.949]  But I also want to hear your solutions.
[01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:17.870]  I believe it's the states, not just the Attorney General suing.
[01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:20.732]  But the state's passing law is nullifying this.
[01:01:20.752 --> 01:01:23.074]  This is completely illegal, unconstitutional.
[01:01:23.714 --> 01:01:25.776]  The way they got the votes for the bill is illegal.
[01:01:26.296 --> 01:01:27.657]  This is a criminal fraud.
[01:01:27.677 --> 01:01:30.179]  We should have grand juries start criminal investigations.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.863]  As Ron Paul has said, the evidence is there, and this will bankrupt our country.
[01:01:35.443 --> 01:01:36.804]  Cap and Trade will bankrupt it.
[01:01:37.345 --> 01:01:40.127]  The Senate won't pass it, so Obama says he's going to implement it.
[01:01:41.288 --> 01:01:42.308]  Through the EPA.
[01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:44.649]  But, I'm going to give each caller about a minute.
[01:01:44.729 --> 01:01:48.011]  Brian in Canada said he had five points he wanted to make.
[01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:48.671]  Make them, Brian.
[01:01:49.411 --> 01:01:53.573]  Okay, I started a group on Facebook on Friday called Forcing Obama Out of Office for Not Ending Abortion.
[01:01:54.253 --> 01:01:58.475]  And my, the five points that I want to go through are, um, 60% of Americans are already opposed to abortion.
[01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:07.819]  The second point is that an unborn baby is a 100% living human being, demonstrating having living systems, like, necessary for life, including DNA in the blood that's different than that of the mother.
[01:02:07.839 --> 01:02:09.800]  And the third point is that
[01:02:10.911 --> 01:02:20.598]  Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 52, Section 1111 of the United States Criminal Code says that murder is the unlawful killing of a human being, which would include an unborn baby.
[01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:33.092]  The next point is that there have been approximately 3,000 murders of unborn babies committed every day on the watch of Mr. Barack Obama, and he has exercised nothing of his executive powers at his disposal, acting as President of the United States, to end those atrocities.
[01:02:33.813 --> 01:02:45.355]  And whereas the Constitution of the United States, this is the fifth point, the Constitution says that the Congress has the ability, anytime they can pass a law that says that the President is no longer the President, and we're going to replace him with somebody else that they deem fit.
[01:02:45.717 --> 01:02:47.358]  All right, Brian, I appreciate your call.
[01:02:47.438 --> 01:02:49.099]  I'm going to get into the abortion issue.
[01:02:49.719 --> 01:02:52.301]  Obama and his so-called executive order.
[01:02:52.341 --> 01:02:53.722]  The guy lies about everything.
[01:02:54.122 --> 01:02:56.623]  An executive order doesn't trump congressional law.
[01:02:57.164 --> 01:03:01.226]  And as Ron Paul said on Fox yesterday, in fact, I want to cue that up for later in the hour.
[01:03:01.246 --> 01:03:02.127]  I want to play a clip of it.
[01:03:02.927 --> 01:03:04.228]  We're already funding abortions.
[01:03:04.288 --> 01:03:07.511]  They send federal money down and the hospitals use it for however they want.
[01:03:07.971 --> 01:03:15.338]  Or they'll take their abortion money and put it over here and then use the federal money to pay for other programs, but still essentially paying for the abortion.
[01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:20.802]  And that's why all the major congressional groups against abortion and all the major Catholic
[01:03:21.863 --> 01:03:25.046]  Bishops and the Protestant groups, all of them have looked at it.
[01:03:25.426 --> 01:03:27.107]  This is funding abortion.
[01:03:27.147 --> 01:03:29.069]  It's making you pay for abortion.
[01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:31.831]  And yes, abortion is one of the biggest hoaxes in history.
[01:03:31.851 --> 01:03:37.035]  50 million dead people, since Roe v. Wade 37 years ago.
[01:03:37.055 --> 01:03:40.497]  51% of blacks are never born.
[01:03:40.578 --> 01:03:42.619]  They kill more than half the black people in this country.
[01:03:42.859 --> 01:03:45.601]  But you hear all the fake liberal black leaders never talking about that.
[01:03:46.062 --> 01:03:49.164]  Half the black people in this country haven't been born in the last 37 years.
[01:03:50.818 --> 01:03:52.299]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:04:00.925]  And to make people pay for this and then try some maneuver where they say an executive order won't let the federal funds go.
[01:04:01.506 --> 01:04:04.027]  All the scholars, even on both sides, say that's a fraud.
[01:04:04.248 --> 01:04:08.250]  The pro-abortion groups have said, psst, don't worry guys, it's a scam.
[01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:09.811]  We're still going to get our death money.
[01:04:10.512 --> 01:04:12.693]  Let's talk to Don in O.K., Oklahoma.
[01:04:12.754 --> 01:04:13.314]  Go ahead, Don.
[01:04:13.874 --> 01:04:14.955]  Thank you, Alex, for having me on.
[01:04:14.975 --> 01:04:18.978]  I was just going to ask you, is right now the time for a constitutional convention?
[01:04:20.731 --> 01:04:22.192]  Here's the problem with the CONCON.
[01:04:22.953 --> 01:04:32.883]  The states, if you've got a majority of states to go for a new amendment, they can pass whatever they want during the Constitutional Convention.
[01:04:33.223 --> 01:04:36.186]  And we've seen a lot of globalists trying to push for one, so it's very dangerous.
[01:04:36.587 --> 01:04:41.512]  What we need to do is take control of the states, have them nullify this unconstitutional law.
[01:04:41.532 --> 01:04:43.173]  They're claiming the Commerce Clause.
[01:04:43.954 --> 01:04:49.576]  That the government, the federal government, can make you buy something from a private corporation?
[01:04:49.896 --> 01:04:52.477]  They never had a federal law that you've got to buy car insurance.
[01:04:52.517 --> 01:04:53.657]  They did that at the state level.
[01:04:53.997 --> 01:04:55.498]  And that's still unconstitutional.
[01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:59.659]  But not as openly unconstitutional as the federal government.
[01:04:59.699 --> 01:05:04.780]  Now they can say, you know, you've got to buy an electric car from GM to prop it up.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:08.802]  Now they can say, Obama's pushing for national service.
[01:05:08.842 --> 01:05:09.982]  Not just a draft, but
[01:05:11.499 --> 01:05:12.640]  People are in denial about this.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:18.624]  I have the video clips of his chief of staff on C-SPAN saying all Americans will serve in national service.
[01:05:19.044 --> 01:05:24.989]  And once they've bankrupted America, they're going to use that crisis to say we've all got to get together in the Depression.
[01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:27.010]  You know, your kids have got to work for the government.
[01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:32.594]  The cyber security bill says they're going to take high school kids and make them work for the federal government, spying on people.
[01:05:32.994 --> 01:05:34.695]  But no, I'm scared of a con con.
[01:05:34.715 --> 01:05:35.436]  What do you think, Don?
[01:05:36.297 --> 01:05:36.777]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:05:36.797 --> 01:05:38.738]  That's why I was asking.
[01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:40.159]  Any other points?
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:40.840]  No.
[01:05:41.809 --> 01:05:42.910]  Well, I appreciate your call, Don.
[01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:43.731]  Very good question.
[01:05:45.952 --> 01:05:48.014]  Let's talk to Matt in the United Kingdom.
[01:05:48.594 --> 01:05:49.175]  Go ahead, Matt.
[01:05:50.396 --> 01:05:52.718]  Hi, Alex, and welcome to Eugenics Britain.
[01:05:53.098 --> 01:05:55.440]  I was listening to you and James there.
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.301]  I've got two questions, actually.
[01:05:57.582 --> 01:06:02.025]  I reckon the British energy system is very much going to get like yours in America.
[01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:08.270]  If you can't pay for medical care, then obviously it's the endgame and it's the eugenics thing.
[01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:10.472]  And also in the UK, what they're doing now, Alex, is
[01:06:11.061 --> 01:06:20.570]  They're handing out leaflets saying we are going to pass your medical details and exchanging between different doctors and the hospital services to obviously think if you're obese or...
[01:06:21.158 --> 01:06:23.879]  You think alcohol, again, is another eugenics problem?
[01:06:23.899 --> 01:06:24.560]  What's your take on that?
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:24.780]  No, no, no.
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:28.762]  It's the nanny state where they tax beer, salt, beef.
[01:06:29.642 --> 01:06:31.923]  They track every facet of your lives.
[01:06:32.223 --> 01:06:33.744]  And as you know, you live in England.
[01:06:33.784 --> 01:06:34.605]  It's been in the news.
[01:06:35.465 --> 01:06:38.787]  Some people will rot for a month and die in their beds.
[01:06:39.127 --> 01:06:40.928]  Look at the one area in the U.S.
[01:06:40.948 --> 01:06:42.068]  where the government ran health care.
[01:06:42.408 --> 01:06:45.410]  And it's the worst health care in the nation, the VA hospitals.
[01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:47.171]  And the more money they throw at it,
[01:06:47.631 --> 01:06:53.475]  The VA hospital on average gets more money per patient than any other, even private group, but they give the worst care.
[01:06:53.495 --> 01:06:57.978]  Because it's all going to bureaucracy and the parasites in government.
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:15.671]  Yeah, I mean, also, what people are doing now, we've got a thing, a private medical care thing called Bupa, I don't know if you've heard about it, and basically what, obviously the rich and the aristocracy are obviously going to Bupa, because obviously now the NHS is obviously faltering and falling.
[01:07:17.452 --> 01:07:17.972]  Absolutely.
[01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:21.515]  They always create a two-tier system where the elite can still get their health care.
[01:07:21.875 --> 01:07:23.336]  Great points from the UK, Matt.
[01:07:23.716 --> 01:07:25.678]  Damon in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:07:26.278 --> 01:07:28.700]  Hey, um, call from South Carolina.
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:44.830]  You know, I don't want to sound like doom and gloom, but I'm really concerned because we had Mark Sanford, lover of Hayden, try and refuse to take the stimulus money, and you had all the bulk of the Congress, of the state Congress in South Carolina,
[01:07:46.417 --> 01:07:49.640]  Basically put him up before the Supreme Court and made him take the money.
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:52.422]  You know, so... Well, take Eliot Spitzer.
[01:07:52.482 --> 01:08:01.569]  He's not perfect as the governor of New York, but he exposed the banker bailout as a fraud and they were surveilling him and knew he was visiting hookers and selectively busted him.
[01:08:02.229 --> 01:08:03.110]  Look at your governor.
[01:08:04.091 --> 01:08:19.443]  I mean, I'm not saying it's good to cheat on his wife, but compared to all the other things, you know, Barney Frank can have underage callboys in his house, and that's okay, because he's a globalist, but then your governor goes out and cheats on his wife, and it's as if he's Satan.
[01:08:20.124 --> 01:08:20.624]  Exactly.
[01:08:20.744 --> 01:08:27.790]  And I think what you're going to find is that no matter any state that has the guts to stand up to Obama and his brown shirts right now,
[01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:29.340]  They're just going to go down.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.522]  They'll cut their funding.
[01:08:31.542 --> 01:08:33.784]  They'll do whatever they have to do.
[01:08:33.804 --> 01:08:36.167]  That's why we have the states and the legislatures.
[01:08:36.207 --> 01:08:39.570]  They can't get everybody in the legislature when the people are behind them.
[01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:42.873]  That's why they nullify and start keeping their money.
[01:08:43.153 --> 01:08:44.254]  This is our money.
[01:08:44.615 --> 01:08:49.439]  The federal government has made us dependent because the federal government is run by offshore corporations.
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:51.902]  That's what we've got to make the Republicans talk about.
[01:08:52.242 --> 01:08:53.662]  This isn't a bunch of communists.
[01:08:53.963 --> 01:08:56.123]  Oh, it's communists at the ground level to get control of us.
[01:08:56.363 --> 01:08:59.724]  This is the biggest, most wealthy interests that want monopolies.
[01:08:59.784 --> 01:09:00.324]  Anything else?
[01:09:00.825 --> 01:09:01.425]  One more thing.
[01:09:01.905 --> 01:09:08.147]  I think the ultimate solution here, and we haven't heard much from them, is the doctors of this country.
[01:09:08.327 --> 01:09:15.229]  Either they're all getting something out of this deal, or if they don't all go on strike and just say, you know what?
[01:09:15.469 --> 01:09:17.269]  We're not going to take your government plan.
[01:09:17.629 --> 01:09:17.989]  All right?
[01:09:18.009 --> 01:09:18.710]  We didn't want...
[01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:20.751]  That's already happening.
[01:09:20.771 --> 01:09:27.034]  You've got Walgreens and many of its chain stores saying we're not going to accept April 16th and past that.
[01:09:27.074 --> 01:09:34.838]  Seattle Post Intelligence or Seattle Times, excuse me, reported that last Friday because the compensation isn't enough to even pay for it.
[01:09:35.278 --> 01:09:37.499]  And so a lot of doctors are just retiring early.
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:38.960]  But the system doesn't care.
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:42.382]  You know, they don't care if they put naked body scanners in and you don't fly.
[01:09:42.582 --> 01:09:43.723]  They don't want you flying.
[01:09:44.583 --> 01:09:46.904]  The big banks issue the currency and credit.
[01:09:47.164 --> 01:09:48.965]  They want to shut down the economy.
[01:09:49.326 --> 01:09:50.286]  I appreciate your call.
[01:09:50.866 --> 01:09:52.607]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kenneth in New Mexico.
[01:09:52.667 --> 01:09:53.528]  Kenneth, you're on the air.
[01:09:55.309 --> 01:09:55.849]  You got me?
[01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.669]  Yes, sir.
[01:09:57.230 --> 01:10:03.913]  Hey, well, they did it, and here we are, and I don't know what we're going to do at this point.
[01:10:05.324 --> 01:10:08.466]  We can scream and yell and raise all the cane we want.
[01:10:08.646 --> 01:10:09.226]  They've done it.
[01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:19.231]  And they've got a provision where it'll take 60% of the House or more and 60 of the 100 senators to repeal this stinking thing.
[01:10:20.832 --> 01:10:22.673]  I don't know how in the world we're ever going to do that.
[01:10:22.693 --> 01:10:26.054]  I mean, you know, we're back to a left-right thing.
[01:10:26.094 --> 01:10:27.655]  This isn't a left-right deal.
[01:10:28.365 --> 01:10:35.289]  No matter, if we fire them all and put all new ones in there, how much do you think they're giving each one of them, like Kucinich?
[01:10:35.309 --> 01:10:37.630]  You think he got a billion, a half a billion?
[01:10:37.851 --> 01:10:47.716]  No, Kucinich, his wife is definitely wearing the pants, and I would imagine he was told, you don't have a political future if you don't do this.
[01:10:49.097 --> 01:10:55.901]  Oh, so take their money and go ahead and destroy your own country.
[01:10:57.498 --> 01:11:06.567]  Well, that's what's so bad about Kucinich is he knew, even as a socialist, you could respect him because he was against this bill saying, this isn't even socialism.
[01:11:06.907 --> 01:11:08.308]  The healthcare companies wrote this.
[01:11:08.328 --> 01:11:15.355]  This lowers care, cuts Medicare and Medicaid, and steals a bunch of money and turns the IRS loose on people.
[01:11:15.856 --> 01:11:20.480]  And then he got a ride on Air Force One, was taken up on the mountain by the devil, Barry Sitaro.
[01:11:21.341 --> 01:11:22.403]  And that's his real name.
[01:11:22.443 --> 01:11:23.585]  That's even mainstream news.
[01:11:23.625 --> 01:11:24.747]  It's all a fake name.
[01:11:25.528 --> 01:11:27.311]  All the evidence says he wasn't born here.
[01:11:27.331 --> 01:11:29.355]  I mean, he became U.N.
[01:11:32.096 --> 01:11:33.157]  Head of the U.N.
[01:11:33.177 --> 01:11:33.998]  Security Council.
[01:11:34.038 --> 01:11:35.259]  No president ever done that.
[01:11:35.299 --> 01:11:36.580]  He's now a sitting U.N.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:37.681]  operative.
[01:11:37.721 --> 01:11:39.422]  I mean, it's just treason everywhere.
[01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:46.228]  They are practicing treason to make us capitulate and break our back and break our will like a pimp breaks a whore.
[01:11:46.448 --> 01:11:47.389]  Well, I'm not a whore.
[01:11:47.449 --> 01:11:48.270]  I'm not a slave.
[01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:52.614]  I'm a free man, red-blooded, and I am going to stand up against this New World Order.
[01:11:52.914 --> 01:11:54.255]  And don't be down, my friends.
[01:11:54.315 --> 01:11:57.878]  Stay angry, stay focused, and take your town, your city, your state back.
[01:11:57.918 --> 01:11:58.699]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:11:59.195 --> 01:12:02.376]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:12:02.736 --> 01:12:04.577]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:12:05.017 --> 01:12:05.438]  Don't!
[01:12:05.898 --> 01:12:08.919]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:12:09.319 --> 01:12:09.940]  Why pay?
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:16.462]  When you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:12:16.442 --> 01:12:18.103]  's number one debt secret.
[01:12:18.403 --> 01:12:22.125]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:12:22.485 --> 01:12:25.186]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:12:25.626 --> 01:12:32.651]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:12:32.991 --> 01:12:33.952]  Herb K was right.
[01:12:34.192 --> 01:12:37.234]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:38.435]  What have you got to lose?
[01:12:38.815 --> 01:12:39.816]  Stop the calls now.
[01:12:40.096 --> 01:12:41.817]  Get out of debt and have more money.

[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:46.440]  That's 800-822-1291.
[01:13:00.072 --> 01:13:03.736]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:13:04.096 --> 01:13:07.100]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:08.762]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:12.122]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:13:12.142 --> 01:13:18.346]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:13:18.506 --> 01:13:24.049]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:13:24.069 --> 01:13:33.736]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:13:33.816 --> 01:13:35.957]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:13:36.177 --> 01:13:37.518]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:13:37.758 --> 01:13:38.639]  And the Congress is saying,
[01:13:38.999 --> 01:13:40.020]  Who do we make the check out to?
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.042]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:13:42.062 --> 01:13:47.187]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:00.549]  Growing season.
[01:14:00.729 --> 01:14:02.710]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:04.332]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:14:04.632 --> 01:14:05.312]  Think about it.
[01:14:05.613 --> 01:14:09.476]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:14:09.696 --> 01:14:13.199]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:14:13.459 --> 01:14:15.080]  The country is running out of food.
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:17.922]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.

[01:15:46.288 --> 01:15:49.390]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm gonna break down what's really in the build.
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:17.742]  What this power grab is really all about.
[01:16:17.962 --> 01:16:20.304]  Right now we're continuing with your phone calls.
[01:16:22.405 --> 01:16:27.710]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sam in Oklahoma.
[01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:28.370]  You're on the air.
[01:16:29.431 --> 01:16:30.552]  Yes, Alex.
[01:16:31.052 --> 01:16:40.440]  Why aren't the voters in the states where the Senators voted for the health care bill trying to recall their Senators that are elected in 2012 and 2014?
[01:16:42.793 --> 01:16:58.629]  Well, until 1913, with the 17th Amendment, we elected the legislators to our state houses, and they then voted for the senators, and they would routinely recall them, not just to remove them, but to interrogate them, or to make them change their vote.
[01:16:58.669 --> 01:17:00.130]  They were truly creatures of the states.
[01:17:00.771 --> 01:17:04.294]  That's why that was such a tyrannical amendment, the 17th Amendment.
[01:17:04.314 --> 01:17:13.963]  But absolutely, recall senators, recall House members, take our states back, get aggressive, do the same thing that was done to Gray Davis.
[01:17:14.504 --> 01:17:18.307]  But notice they were waiting with Schwarzenegger, the gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting,
[01:17:18.888 --> 01:17:19.908]  Fake environmentalists.
[01:17:19.988 --> 01:17:24.049]  But no, I mean, we can't just let the Attorney General sue over this.
[01:17:24.589 --> 01:17:26.190]  The states have to stand up.
[01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:27.670]  That's the number one solution.
[01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:43.873]  And the lawsuits have to be filed, the discrimination in the Cadillac plans, where the big labor unions are exempt, their plans don't get touched, the payoffs to politicians, the pork barrel to get this through, this unconstitutional executive order.
[01:17:44.254 --> 01:17:45.814]  Now, I mean, if this is
[01:17:46.744 --> 01:17:51.586]  If this stands, presidents will have executive orders to amend, to legislate.
[01:17:52.146 --> 01:17:55.087]  The executive branch doesn't legislate.
[01:17:57.447 --> 01:17:58.328]  Okay, thank you.
[01:17:59.368 --> 01:18:00.408]  Good point, Sam.
[01:18:00.788 --> 01:18:02.789]  Jerry in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[01:18:04.169 --> 01:18:05.030]  Hello, how are you?
[01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.730]  Good, sir.
[01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:07.370]  Good deal.
[01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:08.731]  Two points of view from the South.
[01:18:10.571 --> 01:18:12.312]  First thing, I just appreciate what you're doing.
[01:18:12.936 --> 01:18:21.463]  And, you know, something about people believe they're going to get a free thing no matter what it is, and people think it all comes from the government, and we know it comes from the people.
[01:18:22.124 --> 01:18:29.891]  The other day, I was listening to one of the other talks show hosts, and I won't name who, but he was talking about how nobody knows what's in the bill.
[01:18:29.911 --> 01:18:34.975]  Well, nobody knows what's in the bill, and so I called in, and I said, well, I know what's in the bill.
[01:18:36.236 --> 01:18:40.480]  The pharmaceuticals and the insurance companies wrote the bill.
[01:18:41.351 --> 01:18:46.432]  And then he says, yeah, they were taken down this road and misunderstood what was going on.
[01:18:46.873 --> 01:18:48.333]  He really didn't know what to say.
[01:18:48.413 --> 01:18:52.774]  So I just want to tell you, I appreciate the truth in what you're saying and how you bring it out.
[01:18:53.574 --> 01:18:57.656]  And I'm not for baby killing and I'm not for that type of thing.
[01:18:57.796 --> 01:19:00.736]  You're right on the mark and what you've said over the years is true.
[01:19:00.837 --> 01:19:04.898]  And I just keep plugging in there and you are making headway.
[01:19:04.938 --> 01:19:05.918]  I just want to let you know that.
[01:19:06.394 --> 01:19:07.454]  Well, God bless you, Jerry.
[01:19:07.474 --> 01:19:08.455]  I appreciate the call.
[01:19:08.715 --> 01:19:10.916]  And I'm going to cover that when we come back from the break.
[01:19:12.137 --> 01:19:22.441]  The big Republican talk show hosts are telling the truth when they say, this is an overthrow of our republic, this is tyranny, this is authoritarianism.
[01:19:22.781 --> 01:19:30.625]  I was watching congressional speeches last night after the radio show, right before it passed, and they were telling the truth, but only so far.
[01:19:31.724 --> 01:19:36.287]  It's like saying, hey, your house is on fire, but not telling you who set the house on fire.
[01:19:37.327 --> 01:19:49.674]  And the biggest insurance companies, it's right here in Bloomberg today, this is not a secret, their stock's way up, all this new added bureaucracy is going to shut down their competition.
[01:19:49.754 --> 01:19:50.635]  They wrote the bill.
[01:19:52.387 --> 01:20:02.772]  And all it does is make 30-plus million Americans, buy insurance from them, and the government then comes in and lowers the standard of care in this, quote, comparative care term.
[01:20:03.232 --> 01:20:05.173]  And we know from the white papers what they mean.
[01:20:05.633 --> 01:20:08.654]  The bill just gives the bureaucracy the power to do whatever they want.
[01:20:09.735 --> 01:20:14.497]  And so the Republicans are not telling you that industry wrote this.
[01:20:15.913 --> 01:20:17.574]  They're not telling the people.
[01:20:18.014 --> 01:20:40.906]  I mean, obviously, if you've got trillions of dollars in the insurance companies that are controlled by banks, and they've got enough power to steal tens of trillions of dollars in the last year and a half with the banker bailout takeover, and then not say where the money went, well, this same group isn't going to let a bunch of socialists and a bunch of welfare people actually get something over on them.
[01:20:41.707 --> 01:20:41.887]  No!
[01:20:43.735 --> 01:20:49.051]  There are some new taxes in there on doctors, on health care equipment.
[01:20:51.141 --> 01:20:52.922]  These big corporations, they don't care about that.
[01:20:53.022 --> 01:20:58.363]  So, yeah, you can find some medium-sized and small insurance companies who work against this and lobby.
[01:20:58.924 --> 01:21:02.805]  But the big folks, three months ago, it was in the Wall Street Journal, what we already knew.
[01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:04.686]  They had the spokesman.
[01:21:04.706 --> 01:21:06.366]  This was not the Wall Street Journal saying this.
[01:21:06.806 --> 01:21:08.027]  They had the spokesman.
[01:21:08.527 --> 01:21:12.908]  I gotta pull that up, because when I read his quotes from a speech, I went and found it on C-SPAN.
[01:21:13.308 --> 01:21:20.251]  The head of the insurance company, healthcare insurance company consortium, saying, we wrote this bill.
[01:21:21.471 --> 01:21:30.094]  And if you put a public option in here, which would be a supposed free lunch that the people pay for, but a free lunch for some, we're not going to be for it.
[01:21:31.275 --> 01:21:34.976]  What happens is, the government lowers everybody's... Look.
[01:21:36.317 --> 01:21:39.098]  Normal insurance carriers are going to have higher prices.
[01:21:39.358 --> 01:21:40.418]  Then there's the taxes.
[01:21:40.638 --> 01:21:42.119]  There's the IRS enforcing it.
[01:21:42.319 --> 01:21:44.940]  There's the National ID Health Card Initiative in there.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.181]  Through the ID number.
[01:21:46.361 --> 01:21:47.001]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:48.624 --> 01:21:51.605]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:52.545 --> 01:21:55.286]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:58.026 --> 01:21:59.306]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:21:59.326 --> 01:22:04.668]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:22:04.908 --> 01:22:09.549]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:22:09.929 --> 01:22:14.970]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:20.194]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:22:20.734 --> 01:22:27.660]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.741]  And here's the best part.
[01:22:28.961 --> 01:22:35.326]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:22:35.646 --> 01:22:38.488]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:22:38.828 --> 01:22:40.729]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:22:41.050 --> 01:22:41.970]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.170]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:45.152]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:22:45.633 --> 01:22:47.374]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:23:00.425 --> 01:23:04.075]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:23:04.456 --> 01:23:07.464]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:23:07.705 --> 01:23:09.108]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:23:09.813 --> 01:23:12.473]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:23:12.493 --> 01:23:18.715]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:23:18.875 --> 01:23:23.895]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:23:24.055 --> 01:23:34.117]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:23:34.177 --> 01:23:36.297]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:23:36.518 --> 01:23:37.858]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:23:38.098 --> 01:23:38.978]  And the Congress is saying,
[01:23:39.358 --> 01:23:40.379]  Who do I make the check out to?
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:42.402]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:23:42.702 --> 01:23:47.508]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:23:47.828 --> 01:23:56.959]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:59.773 --> 01:24:00.674]  Global meltdowns.
[01:24:01.014 --> 01:24:02.055]  Massive unemployment.
[01:24:02.435 --> 01:24:03.216]  Endless wars.
[01:24:03.636 --> 01:24:04.898]  A new currency crisis.
[01:24:05.298 --> 01:24:07.019]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.221]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[01:24:09.542 --> 01:24:11.163]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[01:24:11.423 --> 01:24:13.125]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[01:24:13.505 --> 01:24:15.087]  Introducing Off The Grid News.
[01:24:15.487 --> 01:24:21.112]  A weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[01:24:24.275 --> 01:24:24.635]  I think so.
[01:24:54.395 --> 01:25:03.244]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:25:03.485 --> 01:25:05.847]  We are definitely living through strange days.
[01:25:06.588 --> 01:25:07.609]  They have found us.
[01:25:09.042 --> 01:25:11.464]  And this will only embolden the criminals in government.
[01:25:11.904 --> 01:25:15.627]  They all know they're about to be thrown out of Congress, so why not steal even more?
[01:25:15.647 --> 01:25:21.712]  You know, I've heard people say, we should make Congress cut their pay from a couple hundred thousand dollars a year.
[01:25:22.312 --> 01:25:24.434]  Or give their money back, like Ron Paul does.
[01:25:25.295 --> 01:25:29.098]  They don't spend, what is it, thirty-something million?
[01:25:29.118 --> 01:25:30.158]  In fact, Google that.
[01:25:30.599 --> 01:25:33.221]  Average congressional election cost.
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:36.241]  I believe it's $33 million.
[01:25:37.141 --> 01:25:38.922]  A Senate is even more.
[01:25:39.463 --> 01:25:44.465]  They don't spend tens of millions of dollars to get in the House of Representatives to make $200,000 a year.
[01:25:46.406 --> 01:25:49.888]  They didn't spend over a billion dollars on Obama so he could make $400,000 a year.
[01:25:53.666 --> 01:26:13.099]  Those guys pay millions of dollars, many of them, but Bloomberg in all his elections has spent more than a billion to be mayor three times and broke his promise to not run for a third term and then got term limits that he campaigned on the first time, got it repealed.
[01:26:17.503 --> 01:26:23.768]  It's absolutely incredible how much money that these people spend to do this.
[01:26:23.828 --> 01:26:31.193]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors, then I'm going to break down some of the most important points of what's happening with this health care bill and the fight.
[01:26:31.514 --> 01:26:34.156]  Then we'll continue with Shelby, Lisa, Michael, Brandon, and Ronnie.
[01:26:34.436 --> 01:26:39.900]  That'll probably be all the calls we have time for left here in the next 26 minutes of live airtime today.
[01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:41.862]  We'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:26:41.882 --> 01:26:42.442]  to 3 p.m.
[01:26:42.482 --> 01:26:43.883]  Central Standard Time.
[01:26:43.923 --> 01:26:45.845]  If you don't have an AM and FM that carries the whole show,
[01:26:46.385 --> 01:26:49.988]  You can always listen at InfoWars.com on the audio streams of the free podcast.
[01:26:50.288 --> 01:26:53.750]  Don't forget the free iPhone app at InfoWars.com in the listen section.
[01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:56.752]  And be sure and support our AM and FM sponsors as well.
[01:26:57.153 --> 01:26:59.014]  You can also get an XM subscription.
[01:26:59.054 --> 01:27:00.915]  They carry the fourth hour every night.
[01:27:01.316 --> 01:27:04.258]  That's linked up at GCNLive.com on the affiliates page.
[01:27:04.618 --> 01:27:06.179]  And three hours on Saturday.
[01:27:06.199 --> 01:27:08.340]  So be sure and support them as well.
[01:27:08.541 --> 01:27:08.781]  Okay.
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:12.263]  I'll tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's show possible.
[01:27:12.663 --> 01:27:14.566]  One of them is efoodsdirect.com.
[01:27:15.367 --> 01:27:24.217]  And they've got a special ending today where you get three food units, whether small or large, the highest quality storable food out there bar none, and get the fourth one free.
[01:27:25.725 --> 01:27:27.045]  This is an amazing discount.
[01:27:27.246 --> 01:27:31.167]  Non-GMO, non-hybrid, high-quality food that stores for more than 10 years.
[01:27:31.287 --> 01:27:32.727]  A bunch of different food varieties.
[01:27:32.747 --> 01:27:34.848]  They have ready-to-eat, you name it, freeze-dried.
[01:27:35.428 --> 01:27:36.649]  efoodsdirect.com.
[01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:40.170]  That's the letter E. foodsdirect.com or 1-800-409-5633.
[01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:41.130]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:27:41.150 --> 01:27:48.093]  And then we've got a great water filtration system that I use here in the office and my home.
[01:27:48.853 --> 01:27:50.414]  It grabs with our smaller units.
[01:27:50.434 --> 01:27:51.094]  It looks like a water
[01:27:52.642 --> 01:27:54.323]  Cooler without the water bottle on top.
[01:27:54.683 --> 01:27:55.784]  It grabs water out of the air.
[01:27:56.504 --> 01:27:58.385]  Upwards of, or more than seven gallons a day.
[01:27:58.945 --> 01:28:00.666]  And then you can get it hot, cold.
[01:28:00.706 --> 01:28:01.827]  It goes through seven filters.
[01:28:01.847 --> 01:28:04.288]  They got a bunch of other units that are even bigger.
[01:28:04.848 --> 01:28:05.889]  Very affordable.
[01:28:06.289 --> 01:28:07.450]  Ecolablue.com.
[01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:09.411]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[01:28:09.471 --> 01:28:11.772]  Or 1-800-691-6043 if you want a free brochure or information packet.
[01:28:11.792 --> 01:28:11.872]  800-691-6043.
[01:28:11.912 --> 01:28:13.433]  The cleanest, purest water you can get anywhere.
[01:28:20.216 --> 01:28:21.296]  There's no fluoride in this.
[01:28:21.316 --> 01:28:22.197]  There's no nothing in this.
[01:28:22.237 --> 01:28:23.057]  It's right out of the air.
[01:28:23.377 --> 01:28:27.619]  Okolablue.com or 800-691-6043.
[01:28:28.199 --> 01:28:28.500]  Okay.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:38.924]  One of the biggest issues here is private corporate interest, who are not free market, who are monopoly men, wrote this bill.
[01:28:39.805 --> 01:28:42.106]  So this is not even socialism, which is bad enough.
[01:28:42.726 --> 01:28:45.267]  As Kucinich and Dean admitted before they flip-flopped.
[01:28:47.861 --> 01:28:56.435]  This is where the government might help you get insurance, but everybody else and the working poor, you've got to pay for $5,000 a year in insurance.
[01:28:56.756 --> 01:28:59.500]  The IRS is involved in your business, in your life.
[01:29:01.208 --> 01:29:04.310]  16,500 to 20,000 new IRS agents.
[01:29:04.990 --> 01:29:05.871]  That's in the bill.
[01:29:06.011 --> 01:29:06.851]  That's confirmed.
[01:29:07.472 --> 01:29:09.473]  The Democrats have been on the news bragging about it.
[01:29:09.793 --> 01:29:11.954]  So now the IRS becomes the nanny state.
[01:29:12.254 --> 01:29:19.418]  You're not in a free society when the government can force you to buy something.
[01:29:20.399 --> 01:29:20.739]  Okay?
[01:29:21.559 --> 01:29:22.740]  From private interest.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.900]  That's more akin to fascism.
[01:29:25.721 --> 01:29:30.622]  But here's IRS.gov whistleblower informant award.
[01:29:32.243 --> 01:29:33.363]  IRS.gov.
[01:29:34.063 --> 01:29:36.944]  And I'm going to have the document cam for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers zoom in.
[01:29:37.424 --> 01:29:38.025]  It says you get 30%
[01:29:40.814 --> 01:29:49.359]  Fifteen to thirty percent of any amount of money seized when you whistleblow on people not paying the IRS.
[01:29:49.719 --> 01:29:51.340]  What have we seen in the phony drug war?
[01:29:53.781 --> 01:30:01.426]  What type of crime have we seen with informants lying about insurance salesmen, school teachers, you name it, to get drug money?
[01:30:01.646 --> 01:30:05.468]  The cops give them a few thousand, they say, I bought drugs from that house, they raid them.
[01:30:07.090 --> 01:30:11.071]  In fact, I promised to get to this earlier, during the next break, I'll dig it out.
[01:30:11.371 --> 01:30:11.871]  Oh, here it is.
[01:30:14.132 --> 01:30:20.454]  For a decade or more, Mexican Mafia has been, and all these different gangs, has been killing people all over the country.
[01:30:21.174 --> 01:30:22.115]  What does this have to do with this?
[01:30:24.075 --> 01:30:26.736]  The police won't do anything to stop them because they're afraid of them.
[01:30:27.176 --> 01:30:29.817]  The American people who roll over to anything are a better target.
[01:30:32.062 --> 01:30:47.151]  But instead of the government going after the really dangerous gangs in this country that are now attacking police stations, can you imagine if a patriot, conservative, or libertarian group pumped natural gas into the LAPD police department to blow it up?
[01:30:47.511 --> 01:30:48.652]  How big a news that would be.
[01:30:48.992 --> 01:30:52.234]  Or if they rigged booby traps with guns to shoot cops.
[01:30:53.134 --> 01:30:57.277]  Or if they killed cops or came across the border and robbed sheriffs when they seized drugs.
[01:30:59.150 --> 01:31:02.191]  Mexico is collapsing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:02.391 --> 01:31:04.831]  I'm going to cover this more tomorrow because I want to get back into health care, but look.
[01:31:05.731 --> 01:31:06.872]  Gang crackdown.
[01:31:06.972 --> 01:31:10.792]  Vagos Motorcycle Club targeted in police raids.
[01:31:11.673 --> 01:31:17.194]  And it gets into how they were caught pumping gas into the police department.
[01:31:18.874 --> 01:31:20.254]  That's the main suspects in this.
[01:31:20.694 --> 01:31:23.335]  Biker gang investigated in booby trap mystery.
[01:31:27.233 --> 01:31:33.839]  Drilling a hole in the roof of a police building and delivering a natural gas line from a heater filled the space with flammable gas.
[01:31:33.879 --> 01:31:40.745]  The trap was discovered before anyone was hurt.
[01:31:41.145 --> 01:31:46.510]  $200,000 reward for info on helmet police booby traps.
[01:31:47.591 --> 01:31:51.756]  Gang tries to kill police on and on and on and on.
[01:31:52.517 --> 01:31:54.880]  Mexican Mafia poses danger in Arizona.
[01:31:55.220 --> 01:32:03.210]  But no, most of the feds that are out there and most of the regular cops that are out there are busy CPSing people's kids because they spanked them.
[01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:06.051]  Or seizing people's houses for environmental groups.
[01:32:06.391 --> 01:32:07.692]  Or writing people tickets.
[01:32:07.712 --> 01:32:11.673]  And that's in the news that all over the country, the quotas, the police have now admitted they have quotas.
[01:32:11.893 --> 01:32:12.774]  They've always lied about it.
[01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:15.995]  To write more tickets and squeeze the citizens are increasing.
[01:32:16.395 --> 01:32:20.877]  And meanwhile, the IRS is to enforce this through the health care bill.
[01:32:21.537 --> 01:32:27.080]  And there's a separate provision on narking on people who are mowing yards or having
[01:32:29.497 --> 01:32:30.417]  In fact, people won't believe it.
[01:32:30.497 --> 01:32:37.501]  Pull up, million dollar fine and jail time, it's Fox News and AP, for garage sale.
[01:32:38.481 --> 01:32:55.829]  I want people to see that on screen and hear it on the radio because, again, we are the target, the general public, but the criminals that run society, they are above the law and are being completely allowed to run wild.
[01:32:56.329 --> 01:32:58.530]  Okay, now let me start getting in
[01:32:59.445 --> 01:33:07.247]  To a big recap on the health care bill and the type of control that we're seeing unfold here.
[01:33:19.791 --> 01:33:22.272]  I'm busy here trying to dig through my stack and
[01:33:24.212 --> 01:33:25.233]  Get all this together.
[01:33:25.874 --> 01:33:30.921]  I covered a lot of this in the first hour and two hours yesterday, but I'll definitely have to do the first two hours tomorrow.
[01:33:30.941 --> 01:33:35.728]  And if we have guests, we better just move them or something, because I need to have some time to walk through this.
[01:33:35.768 --> 01:33:39.994]  And I start getting desperate here in the last 19 minutes of the show to cover it all.
[01:33:40.534 --> 01:33:40.795]  Okay.
[01:33:44.264 --> 01:33:48.586]  I've got all these news articles you can see on the document cam spread out in front of me.
[01:33:49.186 --> 01:33:53.588]  And I've got backup with the bill and with the subsections on every one of these issues.
[01:33:53.608 --> 01:33:59.191]  But I'm just going to run through it quickly and then tomorrow I'm going to go back through all this in total detail because it's so important.
[01:33:59.551 --> 01:34:02.052]  I mean on this first point I happen to have the stack here in front of me.
[01:34:03.333 --> 01:34:08.575]  But on other areas I need to be able to dig into the stacks because it's just a nightmare of proof and information.
[01:34:09.075 --> 01:34:09.816]  There's too much proof.
[01:34:10.885 --> 01:34:12.667]  This nation is bankrupt.
[01:34:13.468 --> 01:34:20.517]  We owe hundreds and hundreds of times, with the derivatives and all the rest of it, what we actually produce in our GDP.
[01:34:20.778 --> 01:34:24.322]  This has been done by design by the banks, and they know it.
[01:34:25.191 --> 01:34:27.573]  And so we cannot pay for this.
[01:34:27.693 --> 01:34:29.274]  The nation is collapsing.
[01:34:29.835 --> 01:34:35.720]  All our jobs are going to India, China, Mexico, and other third world nations that have none of this bureaucracy.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.003]  Communist countries have much lower taxes than we do.
[01:34:40.463 --> 01:34:41.684]  Third world nations do.
[01:34:43.346 --> 01:34:46.949]  The IMF paints a grim picture of fiscal tightening needs.
[01:34:47.569 --> 01:34:49.270]  Reuters, where they're going to raise
[01:34:50.325 --> 01:35:02.711]  Taxes, but then cut your benefits, just like the health care bill cuts Medicare and Medicaid, raises everybody's taxes who does have health care, the IRS controls, and can garnish your wages or take your refund of your bank account.
[01:35:04.755 --> 01:35:05.396]  Here's another one.
[01:35:05.496 --> 01:35:10.119]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC cash.
[01:35:10.259 --> 01:35:12.161]  And this is out of Bloomberg.
[01:35:12.661 --> 01:35:22.990]  And it says federal regulators are going to the big government, police, fire, state and federal and saying, we're telling you to invest in failing banks.
[01:35:23.550 --> 01:35:27.233]  That's actually in this article right here.
[01:35:27.253 --> 01:35:29.515]  That I'm going to show you a shot of.
[01:35:31.667 --> 01:35:36.230]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDI seeks cash.
[01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:41.593]  Folks, you've all got to Google or search engine or smartpage.com this article and read it.
[01:35:42.273 --> 01:35:54.681]  It says to prop it up, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp is trying to encourage public retirement funds that control more than $2 trillion to buy all or part of failed lenders.
[01:35:54.721 --> 01:35:55.301]  Did you hear that?
[01:35:55.721 --> 01:35:58.183]  They want to invest your pension
[01:35:59.599 --> 01:36:04.980]  That's already invested in the stock market and down by 40% in many cases in failed lenders.
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.201]  Taking a more direct role in propping up the banking system.
[01:36:08.301 --> 01:36:10.721]  It's not propping them up, they're stealing your money.
[01:36:11.701 --> 01:36:12.401]  Out one door.
[01:36:13.621 --> 01:36:13.982]  Okay?
[01:36:14.842 --> 01:36:15.522]  Here's another one.
[01:36:15.702 --> 01:36:16.702]  This is out of Business Week.
[01:36:16.922 --> 01:36:19.463]  Healthcare overhaul adds millions of U.S.
[01:36:19.483 --> 01:36:19.963]  customers.
[01:36:20.263 --> 01:36:24.583]  Talks about how the big four insurance companies wrote it and are getting all this money and power out of it.
[01:36:25.064 --> 01:36:25.804]  Here's another one.
[01:36:26.344 --> 01:36:27.124]  CNBC.
[01:36:29.332 --> 01:36:33.835]  Healthcare stocks to outperform in the coming months because this is good for them.
[01:36:34.815 --> 01:36:38.737]  Here's Kucinich before he flip-flops saying it's a bailout for the insurance companies.
[01:36:38.997 --> 01:36:44.821]  You see, if the Republicans... I hear Limbaugh every time I tune in and say how good the insurance companies, how great they are.
[01:36:46.862 --> 01:36:48.443]  They're a barrel of snakes at the top.
[01:36:49.343 --> 01:36:50.444]  Not your little local ones.
[01:36:51.304 --> 01:36:52.285]  They're a barrel of snakes.
[01:36:54.662 --> 01:37:05.106]  I saw an article where one owner of an insurance company made over a billion dollars last year, and that's fine if they did it through free market, but they're doing it because through Medicare and Medicaid and all the government payments.
[01:37:05.826 --> 01:37:11.048]  It was like Frisk in the Senate and all that money he made off of government contracts.
[01:37:11.408 --> 01:37:13.369]  That's why this happened.
[01:37:13.389 --> 01:37:15.110]  That's why this got passed.
[01:37:17.486 --> 01:37:18.747]  But I get back to the good news.
[01:37:18.767 --> 01:37:20.849]  38 states are saying they're going to try to block it.
[01:37:21.089 --> 01:37:23.371]  We have to make sure the states pass laws to nullify it.
[01:37:23.851 --> 01:37:25.112]  Just like this Reuters article.
[01:37:26.293 --> 01:37:26.613]  U.S.
[01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:29.936]  states sue EPA to stop greenhouse gas tax rules.
[01:37:30.337 --> 01:37:31.177]  There's no law.
[01:37:31.457 --> 01:37:32.738]  The bureaucrats are just doing it.
[01:37:33.259 --> 01:37:34.600]  So the people are saying no.
[01:37:35.301 --> 01:37:36.822]  Alright, continuing on through these points here.
[01:37:43.126 --> 01:37:46.570]  Another key point is this comparative medicine term.
[01:37:47.170 --> 01:37:48.452]  That's the death panels.
[01:37:48.532 --> 01:37:50.073]  That's the bioethicist boards.
[01:37:50.093 --> 01:37:54.058]  That's Tom Daschle, the original author, writing that you have a duty to die.
[01:37:54.418 --> 01:37:57.902]  That's for people that are paying for insurance.
[01:37:59.392 --> 01:38:10.358]  And could afford insurance, they're going to lower your overall care for their profits and then pass some of that on to the illegal aliens and others that were marching and were called darlings by the media over the weekend.
[01:38:11.238 --> 01:38:15.621]  We have foreigners in our country telling us to give them more free goodies.
[01:38:17.898 --> 01:38:20.619]  You have how this was planned, how this was rammed through.
[01:38:20.979 --> 01:38:26.861]  In some cases, billions of dollars of pork barrel to certain districts and sweetheart deals to get votes.
[01:38:27.581 --> 01:38:32.303]  You have the fact that this is so unconstitutional for the government to order you to buy something.
[01:38:32.323 --> 01:38:43.026]  You have that some unions and government unions are exempt from the Cadillac tax of 40 plus percent on people that have premium insurance.
[01:38:43.407 --> 01:38:44.447]  Total discrimination.
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:59.929]  And you have the key point that the Republicans have sold us out and supported unconstitutional measures in the past and are guilty of helping the Democrats set this precedent.
[01:39:00.209 --> 01:39:01.670]  You can't have undeclared wars.
[01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:03.171]  You can't have the Patriot Act.
[01:39:03.411 --> 01:39:04.451]  You can't have torture.
[01:39:04.672 --> 01:39:05.832]  You can't have secret arrests.
[01:39:05.872 --> 01:39:06.973]  You can't have NORTHCOM.
[01:39:07.273 --> 01:39:09.295]  You can't have warrantless wiretapping.
[01:39:10.075 --> 01:39:13.497]  All of that is just as egregious and illegal as this health care bill.
[01:39:13.757 --> 01:39:18.319]  You can't pick and choose what part of the Bill of Rights and Constitution you like.
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:21.121]  I hear all these idiots saying the Constitution's failed.
[01:39:21.181 --> 01:39:29.025]  No, we failed enforcing it, and we need to look in the mirror and realize it's we, the people, that take a lot of the blame in all of this.
[01:39:31.325 --> 01:39:39.550]  The establishment is crowing and bragging on the news that they think you're going to forget about this because this is phased in from 2013 to 2018.
[01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:48.275]  And they are bragging that they're going to incrementally do it and that you're going to forget about it and that your anger is going to dissipate.
[01:39:48.976 --> 01:39:50.737]  The key is you can't let that happen.
[01:39:51.157 --> 01:39:54.519]  You have to make this, the establishment's, waterloo.
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:58.641]  Remember how they promised us NAFTA and GAFTA.
[01:40:00.102 --> 01:40:00.923]  NAFTA and GATT.
[01:40:02.509 --> 01:40:05.432]  The Shafta were going to help us.
[01:40:05.492 --> 01:40:06.273]  We're going to be great.
[01:40:06.573 --> 01:40:07.774]  Look at our cities collapsing.
[01:40:07.794 --> 01:40:09.576]  Look at Detroit with our 50% unemployment.
[01:40:10.056 --> 01:40:13.199]  Look at how it's destroyed our nation's industrial base.
[01:40:13.459 --> 01:40:16.722]  They promised us then that the service industry would be the savior.
[01:40:17.003 --> 01:40:18.104]  That's now contracting.
[01:40:18.444 --> 01:40:19.345]  The real unemployment is 22%.
[01:40:20.686 --> 01:40:28.030]  So first they destroy your industrial base, take your jobs, and then they bankrupt the states with more and more unfunded mandates.
[01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:31.192]  Then the people become so poor they've got to have the free health care.
[01:40:31.392 --> 01:40:33.493]  They rob whoever else has got a job left.
[01:40:34.053 --> 01:40:37.795]  This is about conquering society.
[01:40:37.855 --> 01:40:39.576]  This is about domesticating you.
[01:40:39.917 --> 01:40:41.477]  This is about breaking your will.
[01:40:42.078 --> 01:40:47.801]  And they know what they're doing because the banks get their power when the society goes bankrupt.
[01:40:51.351 --> 01:41:00.757]  And once they've got more than half the public with a government job or on government payroll and some kind of government check, I know they took your money to pay for it.
[01:41:01.177 --> 01:41:03.199]  I know a lot of you paid into Social Security.
[01:41:03.239 --> 01:41:05.320]  I'm not saying you don't deserve something.
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:13.605]  The point is, they make you dependents, and then they use you and the illegal aliens they've brought in as a political weapon against the Republic.
[01:41:13.926 --> 01:41:19.089]  And in the end, they're going to take all the chicken feet away from you, as they've done in every other nation.
[01:41:22.250 --> 01:41:27.072]  So this is a slow roast that we're witnessing.
[01:41:27.112 --> 01:41:29.073]  This is incremental slavery.
[01:41:29.753 --> 01:41:37.936]  But it is an eye-opener to show the people that it's unconstitutional, it's illegal, it's unpopular, but still they did it.
[01:41:38.156 --> 01:41:47.500]  So the number one thing is to commit yourself with cold determination to go to city council, to go to the state houses, to run for office, to support good candidates.
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:42:00.503]  And to demand your cities stop having sanctuary cities, and discriminating against citizens, and letting the illegal aliens drunk drive and not have IDs, but citizens get the book thrown at them, and to make the cities take the fluoride out of the water.
[01:42:01.044 --> 01:42:02.424]  Every poll shows that people want that.
[01:42:02.464 --> 01:42:03.224]  Why doesn't it happen?
[01:42:03.524 --> 01:42:04.644]  We don't care if you say it's good.
[01:42:04.664 --> 01:42:05.385]  We know it's poison.
[01:42:05.745 --> 01:42:08.365]  We have to get angry and take our government back.
[01:42:08.446 --> 01:42:16.848]  I don't care if you start following city council people around as investigative reporters, start your own blog, and videotape them with hookers, or taking bribes.
[01:42:17.788 --> 01:42:23.391]  People in government that are selling their country out at the mid-level and high levels are all corrupt.
[01:42:23.811 --> 01:42:29.413]  You start surveilling them, you start putting it on YouTube, they will fall.
[01:42:31.855 --> 01:42:33.415]  Alright, I'm going to look over all my notes.
[01:42:33.435 --> 01:42:35.016]  There's so much I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:42:36.517 --> 01:42:38.998]  I'm going to take a few final phone calls, too, in the final segment.
[01:42:39.538 --> 01:42:44.561]  And I want to go back to what Obama tried last year with health care to give you an idea of their mindset.
[01:42:44.581 --> 01:42:47.182]  Remember, he wanted to take veterans' health care away.
[01:42:48.194 --> 01:42:48.734]  Remember that?
[01:42:49.615 --> 01:42:52.597]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:42:52.877 --> 01:42:57.461]  I've got two new films premiering in the month of April at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:42:58.854 --> 01:43:00.435]  You may be new to freeze-dry foods.
[01:43:00.655 --> 01:43:02.255]  You may have storable food questions.
[01:43:02.475 --> 01:43:07.037]  You may want to buy your freeze-dried foods from a very reputable company and not go broke in the process.
[01:43:07.337 --> 01:43:08.938]  Welcome to the Freeze-Dry Guy!
[01:43:09.118 --> 01:43:11.439]  Okay, actually, we're more than just one guy.
[01:43:11.539 --> 01:43:14.360]  We're a California-based company that's been serving our U.S.
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:20.123]  military and other government agencies with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[01:43:21.363 --> 01:43:23.744]  See all about us at freeze-dry-guy.com.

[01:43:30.188 --> 01:43:37.112]  Freeze-Dry Guy foods are delicious, require little preparation, and will taste just as fresh decades from now as they do today.
[01:43:37.272 --> 01:43:38.693]  Just add hot water and serve.

[01:43:44.216 --> 01:43:45.837]  Isn't that what you want for your family?
[01:43:46.058 --> 01:43:50.001]  Visit freezedryguy.com or call 866-404-FOOD.
[01:43:50.141 --> 01:43:55.305]  That's 866-404-3663 or go to freezedryguy.com.
[01:43:55.445 --> 01:43:56.526]  Freeze Dry Guy.
[01:43:56.626 --> 01:43:57.967]  The best you can buy.
[01:43:59.788 --> 01:44:03.471]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:44:03.791 --> 01:44:06.814]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:44:07.054 --> 01:44:08.475]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:44:09.156 --> 01:44:11.817]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:11.837 --> 01:44:18.018]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:18.218 --> 01:44:23.740]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:33.382]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:33.502 --> 01:44:35.624]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:35.864 --> 01:44:37.185]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:37.446 --> 01:44:39.728]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:39.908 --> 01:44:41.749]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:42.030 --> 01:44:46.854]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:47.174 --> 01:44:51.958]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:44:52.198 --> 01:44:56.302]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:45:02.995 --> 01:45:04.037]  Afraid to answer it?
[01:45:04.958 --> 01:45:06.420]  Afraid to answer your door?
[01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:13.870]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about ten times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[01:45:14.150 --> 01:45:16.213]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[01:45:16.373 --> 01:45:18.156]  They are expensive payment plans.
[01:45:18.396 --> 01:45:19.738]  And if you're in debt already,
[01:45:23.230 --> 01:45:23.631]  We're good.
[01:45:38.525 --> 01:45:39.185]  We're good to go.
[01:46:05.891 --> 01:46:10.054]  We had the head of the VFW on in February of last year.
[01:46:13.196 --> 01:46:18.180]  Remember when Barack Obama proposed that veterans no longer get their VA cruddy care?
[01:46:19.261 --> 01:46:26.786]  That now they would just give the money to insurance companies and that veterans would have to actually buy their own insurance.
[01:46:26.906 --> 01:46:30.969]  Veterans groups irate at Obama's private insurance proposal.
[01:46:31.369 --> 01:46:31.670]  CNN.
[01:46:35.154 --> 01:46:38.577]  That is the type of things that these people are doing.
[01:46:38.617 --> 01:46:41.699]  That's the type of mindset they have.
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:45.522]  And they know you'll get angry now, but what will you do down the road?
[01:46:45.542 --> 01:46:54.529]  And then Republicans, who 30 plus years ago were against Medicare and Medicaid, which has driven up the price and screwed everything up, now they're for it.
[01:46:55.851 --> 01:46:58.473]  But see, what this bill really did was cut Medicare and Medicaid.
[01:46:59.298 --> 01:47:00.759]  But Dennis, the Senate still went for it.
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:06.484]  So, it's even worse than socialism, and that's the important point I keep hammering home here.
[01:47:06.884 --> 01:47:08.645]  Shelby in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:47:08.665 --> 01:47:11.007]  Hello, Alex.
[01:47:11.568 --> 01:47:12.828]  I'm here in Austin.
[01:47:13.129 --> 01:47:14.990]  It's the first time I've called.
[01:47:15.010 --> 01:47:16.852]  I'm a little nervous.
[01:47:18.032 --> 01:47:25.158]  But I'd just like to point out the fact that you used to talk about Holdren and his eco-science.
[01:47:26.957 --> 01:47:35.463]  It seems to fit right along in there with depopulation, taking your choice away, and healthcare being denied treatments.
[01:47:37.104 --> 01:47:37.604]  Oh no, no, no!
[01:47:37.644 --> 01:47:39.926]  They say that they want death care.
[01:47:40.046 --> 01:47:42.027]  The case for killing Granny, cover of Newsweek.
[01:47:42.327 --> 01:47:43.868]  They say they want to get rid of people.
[01:47:44.128 --> 01:47:49.252]  That's what government becoming your doctor and deciding what care you can get is all about.
[01:47:50.072 --> 01:47:53.695]  It's like the T4 program in Germany during World War II.
[01:47:56.124 --> 01:47:58.846]  Where they killed the mentally ill and infirm.
[01:47:58.946 --> 01:47:59.486]  Absolutely.
[01:47:59.506 --> 01:48:00.667]  Appreciate your call.
[01:48:00.747 --> 01:48:01.607]  Michael in New York.
[01:48:01.627 --> 01:48:02.247]  You're on the air.
[01:48:02.267 --> 01:48:07.990]  Hey, Michael.
[01:48:08.010 --> 01:48:10.271]  Okay, we're going to let him go.
[01:48:10.311 --> 01:48:11.832]  Let's go to Brandon in South Carolina.
[01:48:11.872 --> 01:48:12.612]  Brandon, you're on the air.
[01:48:16.014 --> 01:48:18.675]  You know, sometimes when it rains, it pours with these callers.
[01:48:18.715 --> 01:48:20.116]  You go to them and they're just not there.
[01:48:20.536 --> 01:48:21.576]  And other days they don't do that.
[01:48:21.617 --> 01:48:22.277]  Brandon, are you there?
[01:48:23.863 --> 01:48:25.744]  Okay, Ronnie in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:48:25.764 --> 01:48:26.885]  Three's the charm, hopefully.
[01:48:27.906 --> 01:48:28.526]  Thank you, sir.
[01:48:29.146 --> 01:48:47.258]  The solution here is freedom for family farms and to cancel the Mexican drug war with freedom for the Constitutional Army of Medicinal Marijuana Enthusiasts from 14 states and many municipalities that already exist since 1996.
[01:48:47.298 --> 01:48:47.498]  14 states.
[01:48:49.907 --> 01:48:53.350]  Well, Ronnie, I appreciate your call, but what you're saying is part of a bigger picture.
[01:48:53.370 --> 01:49:01.537]  With the Animal ID, the Premises ID, the flatulent taxes on cows, they want to shut down the family farms.
[01:49:01.557 --> 01:49:02.618]  That is the policy.
[01:49:02.678 --> 01:49:04.199]  They want you dependent on government.
[01:49:04.619 --> 01:49:12.246]  They come into the states and say you can't decriminalize marijuana or even farm hemp that's better than cotton and has no THC in it.
[01:49:12.526 --> 01:49:16.690]  You could smoke an 18-wheeler load and get nothing but a headache.
[01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:20.151]  But that shows how the federal government is out of control.
[01:49:20.371 --> 01:49:29.774]  But some so-called conservatives, even though it's unconstitutional, say, yeah, we don't want these 14 states decriminalizing marijuana for them potheads.
[01:49:30.114 --> 01:49:31.955]  We need to keep the drug war going.
[01:49:32.455 --> 01:49:33.895]  Well, that's unconstitutional.
[01:49:34.376 --> 01:49:35.896]  So you're going to get Obama's health care.
[01:49:36.176 --> 01:49:37.757]  You're going to get unconstitutional wars.
[01:49:37.777 --> 01:49:39.797]  You're going to get the Unconstitutional Patriot Act.
[01:49:40.277 --> 01:49:44.059]  And last year, law enforcement gave us the MIAC and Homeland Security documents.
[01:49:44.119 --> 01:49:44.679]  We broke them.
[01:49:45.279 --> 01:49:46.922]  People couldn't believe it was real for a week.
[01:49:47.463 --> 01:49:50.568]  Where Homeland Security is shut up for we, the people.
[01:49:51.724 --> 01:49:53.605]  And now the IRS is your doctor.
[01:49:53.946 --> 01:49:55.527]  The IRS is going to run your life.
[01:49:55.567 --> 01:50:01.531]  The IRS, every two weeks, is going to be looking at your tax ID number and making sure you're paying that tax money in for insurance.
[01:50:01.792 --> 01:50:03.813]  And this is only the beginning at $5,000 a year.
[01:50:04.133 --> 01:50:06.175]  It's going to go up, and up, and up, and up, and up.
[01:50:06.495 --> 01:50:09.277]  And the quality of the care is going to go down, and down, and down, and down.
[01:50:09.558 --> 01:50:18.564]  And these big mega-corporations that wrote the bill and ran the scam that they didn't want the bill in the media, they're going to get more rich and get more power and control.
[01:50:19.636 --> 01:50:21.437]  And they don't care if America goes bankrupt.
[01:50:21.457 --> 01:50:22.458]  They're offshore banks.
[01:50:23.639 --> 01:50:27.601]  Mexico doesn't care if they go bankrupt as long as Carlos Slim runs everything.
[01:50:28.142 --> 01:50:28.882]  Or North Korea.
[01:50:28.922 --> 01:50:31.264]  They don't care as long as Kim Jong-il runs everything.
[01:50:31.564 --> 01:50:34.145]  This is the nature of a corrupt, decadent society.
[01:50:34.526 --> 01:50:35.426]  God bless you all.
[01:50:35.486 --> 01:50:36.327]  Great job, crew.
[01:50:36.547 --> 01:50:37.728]  We'll see you back live tomorrow.
