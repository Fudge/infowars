[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.301]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:10.762]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:15.587]  We're now an hour and 33 minutes into this Thursday broadcast.
[00:00:15.607 --> 00:00:21.111]  We're simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv live for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:00:22.853 --> 00:00:29.099]  Okay, the last caller said, why do we see the G20 now meeting every few months?
[00:00:30.458 --> 00:00:37.921]  In fact, pull up on screen for people, just type into the search engine the term, banking heads meet in secret in Australia.
[00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:40.561]  Remember that two months ago?
[00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:47.624]  27 banking heads of the G20 and 7 private mega banks all met in secret.
[00:00:49.005 --> 00:01:04.592]  Well, I mean, going back to 1954, Bilderberg has released part of the minutes of their first meeting, and they said, through stealth, through economic trade deals, we're going to create the Asian Union, the North American Union, and the European Union, and we are then going to merge those three.
[00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:15.477]  They've already set up the North American Union by stealth, the EU and the Asian Union are all operating, and we have this in my film, Endgame, Bush actually giving a speech with Merkel and Barroso of the EU,
[00:01:16.437 --> 00:01:23.798]  Saying, we are now merging the North American Union with the European Union, through this Atlantic Agreement.
[00:01:24.338 --> 00:01:37.661]  So, they publicly admit they're doing this, but then separately have armies of pundits out there, saying if you talk about global government run by banks, you're crazy, it doesn't exist, and you're probably a terrorist.
[00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:45.182]  And when I had Nightline here earlier in the week, I was trying to show him clips of Herman Van Rompuy, I was trying to show him clips,
[00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:54.135]  Of Gordon Brown, of Ban Ki-moon, saying global government's here, world governance is here, and it's going to be run by private banks.
[00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:58.297]  And they're going to raise VAT taxes on us, they're going to have carbon taxes on us.
[00:01:58.558 --> 00:02:04.161]  It's like when I had Rothschild, the heir to the Rothschild fortune on, one of the head environmentalists, out there land grabbing.
[00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:06.743]  And he said, there is no such thing as a carbon tax.
[00:02:07.563 --> 00:02:16.345]  Even though at the time he'd been on other TV shows promoting a carbon tax and calling for global government, for my audience the disdain was it doesn't exist.
[00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:22.487]  So we have an argument about whether it exists or not instead of about who's setting up the world government.
[00:02:22.847 --> 00:02:23.767]  Is it tyrannical?
[00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:24.568]  Do we want it?
[00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:25.788]  Do we have a say in it?
[00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:39.301]  And so the G20 is meeting now every month or so with the army called out in England, the army called out in the U.S., the army being called out in Canada, the army being called out in Europe on the continent.
[00:02:40.182 --> 00:02:41.643]  No protesting is allowed.
[00:02:42.223 --> 00:02:43.264]  People are arrested.
[00:02:43.324 --> 00:02:50.649]  There's surveillance everywhere because these are the true controllers, the finance ministers of the 20 industrialized nations.
[00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.115]  Who all are former Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of England executives.
[00:02:56.535 --> 00:02:57.877]  They're private bank holders.
[00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:08.309]  They themselves, in the banking bailouts, which are really just banking robberies, openly get hundreds of millions, in some cases billions of dollars apiece, of the bailout money.
[00:03:09.584 --> 00:03:12.946]  And then they won't even tell Congress or the Parliament where all the money went.
[00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:16.267]  So, I mean, think about how outrageous this is.
[00:03:16.287 --> 00:03:21.469]  So, I hate to even get into this subject without playing clip after clip after clip.
[00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:28.232]  But you can just search engine Herman Van Rompuy, head of the EU, global governance, and you'll get clip after clip after clip and the documents.
[00:03:28.352 --> 00:03:32.414]  Video, audio, government documents, Copenhagen Treaty, you name it.
[00:03:33.494 --> 00:03:43.278]  You can type in Herman, not Herman Von Ruppe, but Ban Ki-moon, Gordon Brown, Barack Obama, Barroso, Merkel, Sarkozy.
[00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:49.161]  I mean, there are hundreds of these in the last year where they're just coming out in the open.
[00:03:49.701 --> 00:03:53.223]  And so they're having more and more meetings because they're at the end.
[00:03:53.723 --> 00:04:15.721]  They're now hammering out the VAT taxes, the financial VAT taxes, the Tobin taxes, the global regulatory system that is a global governance model where the countries get lobbied and financed and paid off to sign their sovereignty away to an open world government run and governed by private banks.
[00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:29.549]  And they stalled the public with Rush Limbaugh and ABC News and the rest of them for all these years saying none of this exists and now they're saying okay it exists but it's not kosher to talk about it or to oppose it.
[00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:39.598]  And so just the latest video, I mean there are new videos constantly from Davos and the list just goes on and on.
[00:04:39.618 --> 00:04:43.281]  Did you guys find the secret banking article out of Australia?
[00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:49.719]  Well, let's put it back up for people again, because I want to read that headline.
[00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:54.264]  Again, these are secret bankers who meet in secret to really set the policy.
[00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:56.327]  They'll meet in secret at Bilderberg.
[00:04:56.367 --> 00:04:58.569]  They'll meet in secret at Trilateral Commission meetings.
[00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:01.453]  We've stolen their internal documents before.
[00:05:01.713 --> 00:05:02.835]  Jim Tucker and others have.
[00:05:03.115 --> 00:05:03.516]  We know.
[00:05:03.996 --> 00:05:08.422]  That's how years before they go public with something, we already know what they're planning.
[00:05:08.442 --> 00:05:10.645]  There it is, secret summit of top bankers.
[00:05:11.005 --> 00:05:14.069]  So, they have secret summits and actually agree on what they're going to do.
[00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.156]  Then they have public PR stunts where they come out and say, we've got to have...
[00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:21.117]  Banking reform.
[00:05:21.457 --> 00:05:29.244]  We've got to stop the big private brokerage firms and investment banks from selling derivatives and destroying the global financial order.
[00:05:29.604 --> 00:05:36.330]  Meanwhile, the entire leadership of the G20 are running this and are involved in it and making money and getting power out of it.
[00:05:37.131 --> 00:05:47.896]  So it's like having mobsters sit over a trial of themselves and then they lie to the public and say this is going to fix the problem when it only gives them more control.
[00:05:48.237 --> 00:05:54.760]  So they create every crisis, that's in the Goldman Sachs emails, they create the crisis and then they offer the solution.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.723]  The Goldman Sachs CEO is on television saying we need to pass this financial regulatory bill.
[00:06:01.584 --> 00:06:02.224]  And what does it do?
[00:06:02.264 --> 00:06:06.147]  It erects global taxes to be paid to the bankers as a, quote, bailout.
[00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:08.128]  Oh, that will certainly show them.
[00:06:08.408 --> 00:06:09.989]  That will certainly get them, won't it?
[00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.952]  So, I'm going to play this video here in a moment, but here's just the latest.
[00:06:13.992 --> 00:06:18.615]  Trichet calls for corrupt BIS boss.
[00:06:20.196 --> 00:06:25.580]  Trichet calls for corrupt Bank of International Settlements to boss global government in CFR speech.
[00:06:26.716 --> 00:06:36.084]  ECB president tells insiders that secretive group of international bankers responsible to no nation-state will become primary engine of world government.
[00:06:36.485 --> 00:06:52.899]  In a speech before the Elitist Council on Foreign Relations organization in New York earlier this week, President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, called for the imposition of global governance to be bossed by the G20 and the corrupt Bank of International Settlements in the name of safeguarding the global economy.
[00:06:53.439 --> 00:07:10.089]  In an address entitled, Global Governance Today, Trichet proclaims how the elite need to impose a set of rules, institutions, that's laws, and informal groupings, that means they can secretly do whatever they want, and cooperating mechanisms that we call global governance.
[00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:10.950]  This is a quote.
[00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:21.736]  During the course of the speech, Trichet used the term global governments well over a dozen times, outlining how global governance is of the essence to avoid another financial crisis.
[00:07:21.996 --> 00:07:23.357]  There's the financial terrorism.
[00:07:23.697 --> 00:07:27.319]  If you don't give us total power, we will destroy everything.
[00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:32.741]  And so, oh, they need $150 billion now for Greece that Goldman Sachs on record engineered.
[00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:37.704]  And now a Goldman Sachs former executive is running the financial operation there with the government.
[00:07:38.304 --> 00:07:40.025]  Oh, now Portugal's going down.
[00:07:40.285 --> 00:07:41.526]  We need hundreds of billions.
[00:07:41.786 --> 00:07:59.215]  Oh, now all these other... Oh, taxpayers have got to give us money when it's derivatives sold by the big brokerage firms to the governments in collusion to make money on the way up, bankrupt the countries on the way down, and get total banking dictatorship out of it.
[00:07:59.675 --> 00:08:02.897]  Again, they're all a bunch of Bernie Madoff types who need to be arrested.
[00:08:04.355 --> 00:08:15.442]  It's on record that the head of Goldman Sachs ordered his people to sell derivatives that they knew were, quote, S-H-T-Y.
[00:08:18.024 --> 00:08:22.507]  Okay, it's on record, but no, we'll give them more power, that will show them.
[00:08:25.262 --> 00:08:38.451]  Section 1 of Trichet's speech is entitled, Why We Need Global Governance, and from then on he constantly invokes the economic downturn as a justification for empowering secretive, undemocratic, and corrupt global institutions with the power to rule the world.
[00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:39.331]  That's the other point.
[00:08:40.432 --> 00:08:43.334]  If I get another email from a yuppie saying, basically,
[00:08:43.934 --> 00:08:50.657]  Well, it's time, like Star Trek, for us to have a global government and no more war and peace, and this is what humanity wants.
[00:08:51.017 --> 00:08:53.938]  Number one, in every poll, humanity doesn't want to lose sovereignty of their countries.
[00:08:54.198 --> 00:08:59.640]  Number two, this is a global government run by private corporations that in their own documents they admit are authoritarian.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:08.782]  Remember last year, and now for world government, Financial Times of London headline, by their foreign editor, where he said, yeah, we've been secretive, yes, it's authoritarian, but it's for your own good.
[00:09:09.042 --> 00:09:19.966]  Two weeks ago, the head of the Gaia movement, the top environmentalist in England, said, we need to have an undemocratic world government to enforce one-child policies and total control, because the public's too stupid to do it.
[00:09:20.346 --> 00:09:24.967]  This is an authoritarian global corporate dictatorship that is being set up.
[00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:39.407]  And he also talks about in the speech, you can read the transcript and watch the whole video, we have it linked up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in this article, where he says, we've been building this for a long time, we've got to go ahead with it now.
[00:09:40.822 --> 00:09:41.142]  Okay?
[00:09:41.622 --> 00:09:58.851]  So, the world government is here, these guys give constant speeches, they run our government illegally, they're openly robbing everybody blind, and you can't get ABC News and Nightline, when they're here in your office, in our office, you can't even get them to stop laughing about it.
[00:09:59.778 --> 00:10:05.842]  Laughing about Goldman Sachs, laughing about what's happening right now, laughing about the country falling apart.
[00:10:05.942 --> 00:10:07.143]  It is a joke.
[00:10:07.703 --> 00:10:09.044]  It doesn't exist.
[00:10:09.384 --> 00:10:13.507]  The video you're about to see doesn't exist according to these people.
[00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:14.947]  Here is a snippet of it.
[00:10:15.408 --> 00:10:23.473]  This transformation which again has been prepared, it is something which didn't come as a sharp and
[00:10:24.198 --> 00:10:29.243]  I would say an expected event, because the G20 existed already.
[00:10:29.303 --> 00:10:40.434]  But this shift from the G7 to the G20, we owe it, it seems to me, obviously, because it was overdue, that these economies that were obviously systemic
[00:10:41.354 --> 00:10:50.839]  at the global level would have a full ownership of this global governance at the level of this informal grouping that I mentioned.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:57.663]  But and that's of course something which appears absolutely obvious.
[00:10:57.903 --> 00:10:58.904]  I trust also
[00:11:00.293 --> 00:11:02.075]  That there is a second reason.
[00:11:02.776 --> 00:11:16.689]  Perhaps the industrialized country proved that they were quite clumsy themselves in running their own economy, which remained, of course, at the core of global finance and of the global economy.
[00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:21.214]  And that is something that we have to take fully into account.
[00:11:22.737 --> 00:11:48.313]  It is of utmost importance that the new Basel rules that we are preparing, and we are in an intense phase of discussion, after having had the input of the industry, the industry was in dialogue with the Basel Committee, we have this industry response, and now we have to engage in calibration.
[00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.714]  Okay, that's enough!
[00:11:51.115 --> 00:11:55.840]  It goes on and on, more than a dozen times, calling for global government, global governance.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:05.510]  Now, when you get SPP documents, or you get North American Union documents, or you get internal EU documents, or Copenhagen documents, like the treaty, they wouldn't give the treaty to the public.
[00:12:05.911 --> 00:12:09.795]  It had to be leaked, and it was confirmed by the London Guardian, and the
[00:12:11.109 --> 00:12:17.352]  The UN admitted, no this is the treaty, and it was just hundreds of taxes, total control, paid to private banks.
[00:12:17.932 --> 00:12:31.619]  And so when you get these documents, it's the top corporations and banks at meetings, they all agree on what they're going to do, and then the presidents and prime ministers sit there like errand boys and errand girls, writing down their orders.
[00:12:33.553 --> 00:12:34.914]  And you just heard him talking about that.
[00:12:35.274 --> 00:12:38.497]  Private corporations are the ones that run this.
[00:12:39.017 --> 00:12:47.384]  And so you've got private central banks and mega-corporations like IBM and Microsoft and Walmart at all of these events.
[00:12:48.045 --> 00:12:53.609]  And so you have government, mega-industry, and mega-media all teamed up together against the public.
[00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:59.554]  They're organized, they're focused, and they control the world through your taxes and regulations.
[00:13:00.868 --> 00:13:05.295]  And here he is, out in the open, calling for global government.
[00:13:05.315 --> 00:13:15.831]  And you can go read the full transcript or watch the entire video in Paul Watson's excellent article, Trichette Calls for Corrupt BIS to Boss Global Government in the CFR Speech.
[00:13:17.332 --> 00:13:21.253]  It nexuses in with the IMF and World Bank and the Federal Reserve and Bank of England.
[00:13:21.554 --> 00:13:24.414]  All just front holding companies for private banks.
[00:13:24.674 --> 00:13:25.315]  That's on record.
[00:13:25.835 --> 00:13:26.875]  But it's totally secret.
[00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:30.396]  All we have is the documents that have been leaked and their speeches.
[00:13:31.177 --> 00:13:34.458]  And what they're talking about openly is completely illegal.
[00:13:35.178 --> 00:13:37.058]  So, that's what's happening.
[00:13:37.539 --> 00:13:40.519]  We have some major breaking news here today.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.601]  This is from Kurt Nimmo.
[00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:46.579]  Is U.S.
[00:13:46.679 --> 00:13:48.420]  Army training to take on the Tea Party?
[00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:51.462]  And he has video of this.
[00:13:52.703 --> 00:13:59.287]  We talked about how they tried to sick riot police on peaceful Tea Party people in Illinois yesterday with Obama.
[00:13:59.727 --> 00:14:01.528]  And now we discover the Army was there.
[00:14:01.568 --> 00:14:02.909]  Well, of course the Army was there.
[00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:07.652]  Regular Army and National Guard at G20 in Pittsburgh last year.
[00:14:08.452 --> 00:14:09.393]  Of course they're there.
[00:14:10.033 --> 00:14:35.169]  I mean, we got the document, what, over a year ago, that the Ron Paul events, the Tea Party events, and of course they have sound cannons at the events for the public in San Diego, and we learned that I'm being surveilled, Ron Paul's being surveilled, that the, in the Fed events, have regular Army intelligence there, and in the particular document we've covered at Nauseam here, it said, don't let them know you're Army, or they may attack you.
[00:14:36.243 --> 00:14:37.804]  So they're telling them we're dangerous terrorists.
[00:14:37.824 --> 00:14:40.685]  You know, we're evil Americans that don't like offshore banks robbing us.
[00:14:41.545 --> 00:14:42.105]  Is the U.S.
[00:14:42.165 --> 00:14:43.826]  Army trying to take on the Tea Party?
[00:14:44.406 --> 00:14:50.729]  On April 17th, the Courier-Journal in Louisville, Kentucky reported on an Army exercise dubbed
[00:14:52.285 --> 00:15:02.735]  M-A-N-G-U-D-A-I, named after the special forces of Genghis Khan's Mongol army, who could fight for days without food or sleep.
[00:15:03.115 --> 00:15:09.241]  The Kentucky newspaper portrayed the exercise as an effort to train soldiers to battle the Taliban in Afghanistan.
[00:15:09.802 --> 00:15:13.465]  Designed to test the limits of officers' physical, mental, and emotional endurance,
[00:15:14.326 --> 00:15:18.068]  They had one of these drills in Austin a week and a half ago, by the way, at Camp Mabry.
[00:15:18.508 --> 00:15:26.792]  The emerging army exercise offered a revealing window onto modern combat training in the era of Iraq and Afghanistan, Chris Kenning wrote for the newspaper.
[00:15:27.132 --> 00:15:34.896]  Over three days last week, participants had to crawl on their bellies under real machine gun fire, shiny commando style.
[00:15:35.956 --> 00:15:41.501]  Shimmy commando style over a single rope, eye in the air, and march for more than 22 miles through the forest.
[00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:49.167]  But according to information received by the Patriot blog post, there's another aspect of the military exercise not reported by local media.
[00:15:49.527 --> 00:15:58.935]  This week I was contacted by a number of military personnel enlisted in officer's ranks who expressed concern about military exercises underway at Fort Knox, the U.S.
[00:15:59.455 --> 00:16:00.516]  Bullion Depository.
[00:16:01.017 --> 00:16:04.600]  As with most such exercises, the Fort Knox alert occurred in stages
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.946]  As if real-time intelligence was being provided to various intervals, writes Mark Alexander.
[00:16:10.326 --> 00:16:18.276]  Alexander cites an intel advisory issued on Friday, April 20, 2010, that identifies terrorist threat adversaries as local militia groups.
[00:16:18.336 --> 00:16:19.017]  That's confirmed.
[00:16:19.818 --> 00:16:21.940]  Anti-government protesters, Tea Party.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.082]  And then we have...
[00:16:24.477 --> 00:16:25.138]  A link to that.
[00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:30.344]  In short, the military was training in Kentucky to take on mythical militias.
[00:16:31.005 --> 00:16:32.366]  And that's also going on in Illinois.
[00:16:32.687 --> 00:16:38.374]  No word if they were the FBI creative variety and remarkably the non-violent Tea Party movement.
[00:16:38.394 --> 00:16:43.460]  See, North Com and Homeland Security is meant to engage red-blooded Americans.
[00:16:46.215 --> 00:16:48.676]  We even have the military now talking about the scenario.
[00:16:49.396 --> 00:16:58.480]  It continues, anti-government health care protesters have stated that they would join the Tea Party as a sign of solidarity during a protest at Fort Knox.
[00:16:58.921 --> 00:17:04.163]  The Tea Party groups are armed, have combative training, and some are former military snipers.
[00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:08.045]  Some may have explosive training experience according to the Intel report.
[00:17:08.565 --> 00:17:10.666]  So this is what the military is being taught.
[00:17:11.586 --> 00:17:19.932]  And I told you over a year and a half ago they were training every police department for IED attacks, improvised explosive device attacks, by militias.
[00:17:20.833 --> 00:17:28.559]  And they're going to stage attacks, say the American people are doing it, and they're going to try to roll the military out nationwide to confiscate the guns, just like New Orleans.
[00:17:28.599 --> 00:17:30.560]  They are preparing for this.
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.921]  We've got to get the word out now.
[00:17:32.461 --> 00:17:35.744]  They'll blow up a few federal buildings, they'll kill some troops, and blame it on us.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:45.622]  The Intel report updated Monday, the 26th of April 2010, noted that the rally at the militia compound occurred and viable threats have been made.
[00:17:45.962 --> 00:17:51.743]  Many members were extremely agitated at what they referred to as government intervention over taxation in their lives.
[00:17:52.403 --> 00:17:54.484]  We'll be right back with more of this.
[00:17:55.144 --> 00:17:58.305]  This is just more devastating information.
[00:17:58.345 --> 00:17:59.505]  I want Watson to do a boil-down.
[00:18:00.285 --> 00:18:03.246]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:18:05.998 --> 00:18:07.260]  This message is for you.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.026]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:18:11.286 --> 00:18:12.829]  Add less than 2 cents per gallon.
[00:18:13.169 --> 00:18:16.254]  Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water.
[00:18:16.454 --> 00:18:18.217]  Remove dangerous chlorine fluoride.
[00:18:20.282 --> 00:18:26.164]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.
[00:18:26.445 --> 00:18:30.946]  From the smallest to the largest systems, BigBerkyWaterFilters.com has what you need.
[00:18:31.286 --> 00:18:37.469]  With your system purchase, you'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter, or two sport Berky bottles absolutely free.

[00:19:00.298 --> 00:19:01.558]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:19:01.578 --> 00:19:06.940]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.802]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:19:12.202 --> 00:19:17.224]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:19:17.751 --> 00:19:22.454]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:24.916]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:19:25.296 --> 00:19:29.900]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.000]  And here's the best part.
[00:19:31.221 --> 00:19:33.983]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:19:34.303 --> 00:19:37.605]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:19:37.925 --> 00:19:40.747]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:19:41.108 --> 00:19:42.989]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[00:19:49.264 --> 00:19:51.589]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:56.639]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.345]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:20:00.588 --> 00:20:02.270]  Oh, my sinuses!
[00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.211]  They feel like they'll explode!
[00:20:04.271 --> 00:20:04.952]  Sinus pressure.
[00:20:05.092 --> 00:20:06.773]  Sinus headaches that keep you up at night.
[00:20:06.853 --> 00:20:07.994]  You've struggled for years.
[00:20:08.114 --> 00:20:13.779]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[00:20:13.959 --> 00:20:14.559]  Sound familiar?
[00:20:14.719 --> 00:20:15.540]  Well, you're not alone.
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.243]  Statistics show that 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress.
[00:20:19.423 --> 00:20:24.267]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.

[00:21:04.497 --> 00:21:05.498]  This is so amazing.
[00:21:05.538 --> 00:21:11.603]  During the three-minute break, I'm reading over the actual intel documents from the U.S.
[00:21:11.803 --> 00:21:13.564]  Army, directly from the U.S.
[00:21:13.704 --> 00:21:18.288]  Army, posted on mainstream newspaper posts.
[00:21:18.408 --> 00:21:20.269]  This is mainstream news.
[00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.771]  Exercise, exercise, exercise.
[00:21:23.752 --> 00:21:29.776]  Taking on military, U.S., former military that's planning to kill U.S.
[00:21:29.816 --> 00:21:30.156]  troops.
[00:21:30.196 --> 00:21:33.578]  See, and this has been going on forever, but now it's intensifying.
[00:21:33.999 --> 00:21:35.820]  And they've got riot training, you name it.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.921]  First, they train the troops to take on Muslims.
[00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:41.183]  And they also have some of that, the drills, guys wearing headdresses.
[00:21:42.964 --> 00:21:45.166]  But then they just shift over
[00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:51.959]  And they talk about the militias are drunk and that alcohol use fanned the flames.
[00:21:52.299 --> 00:21:58.841]  Many military-grade firearms were openly carried at the militia compound, former U.S.
[00:21:58.901 --> 00:21:59.821]  military involved.
[00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:00.942]  So, the U.S.
[00:22:01.022 --> 00:22:03.962]  military, this is the headline Watson needs to put up, or Curt needs to put up.
[00:22:04.443 --> 00:22:05.623]  This is confirmed.
[00:22:06.463 --> 00:22:13.125]  I mean, you know, Kurt is a professional journalist who's worked for major newspapers, and I love Kurt to death, but it shouldn't be, is the U.S.
[00:22:13.205 --> 00:22:15.066]  Army training to take on the Tea Party?
[00:22:15.506 --> 00:22:21.108]  It says they're training to take on the Tea Party and the militias in the documents right here.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:23.580]  I don't even know.
[00:22:24.201 --> 00:22:31.388]  I want to have Dr. Bob Bowman on about other issues, but I pretty much... I'm going to get him to talk about this because, I mean, this is a subject we've got to talk about now.
[00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:34.171]  Folks, it's just... it's happening so fast.
[00:22:34.491 --> 00:22:35.932]  It's happening so furious.
[00:22:37.354 --> 00:22:43.219]  For presentplanet.tv viewers, we'll pull the article up on screen for people where we have these documents saved.
[00:22:44.147 --> 00:22:49.230]  And you can go read these for yourself, dated April 23rd and April 26th.
[00:22:49.311 --> 00:22:54.374]  Some of this was just going on three, four days ago, and this is just disgusting.
[00:22:55.074 --> 00:22:59.698]  And I'm reading this, that militias are going to attack the Fort Knox Gold Depository.
[00:23:00.038 --> 00:23:02.479]  Give me a stinking break.
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.101]  I mean, is there no end to this?
[00:23:05.161 --> 00:23:09.744]  That's why you've got to get Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA on DVD.
[00:23:11.064 --> 00:23:17.173]  And make copies and get out to everyone you know because we show how they're staging the terror, how they're brainwashing the military.
[00:23:17.714 --> 00:23:24.765]  We have military commanders on admitting they were doing gun confiscation drills in Iowa, practicing going door-to-door to take the guns!
[00:23:25.876 --> 00:23:28.337]  I mean, they're training to take our guns.
[00:23:28.517 --> 00:23:29.937]  They're saying we're terrorists.
[00:23:29.957 --> 00:23:34.938]  They're training the Boy Scouts and the New York Times reports to, quote, take on disgruntled veterans.
[00:23:35.138 --> 00:23:41.860]  We have the MIAC and Homeland Security reports, where they admitted over a year ago that the main target of Homeland Security is the American people.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:47.282]  And then last week, the head of the FBI said, yes, we're shifting from Muslims to the American people.
[00:23:47.802 --> 00:23:50.262]  And the Muslim threat is fake to a certain extent.
[00:23:50.522 --> 00:23:51.903]  This is completely fake.
[00:23:52.663 --> 00:23:57.766]  And they're staging these events and building it up to use the military against us.
[00:23:58.106 --> 00:24:01.168]  And large portions of the military are already illegal aliens they've hired.
[00:24:01.188 --> 00:24:06.111]  Obama rallied with a bunch of illegal alien troops that they were legalizing last week.
[00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:08.532]  I mean, we are in so much trouble.
[00:24:08.612 --> 00:24:12.434]  I just can't even believe how sickening all of this is getting.
[00:24:13.114 --> 00:24:13.875]  The demonstration
[00:24:15.834 --> 00:24:18.415]  Did not happen due to federal and local law enforcement influence.
[00:24:18.435 --> 00:24:20.836]  So they're saying they went in and stopped the demonstration.
[00:24:21.296 --> 00:24:25.377]  Possible raid on local white supremacist organization may have been made in the last 48 hours.
[00:24:25.838 --> 00:24:32.060]  And see, they talk about white supremacists and they say Tea Party organizers stated that they will protest at the Gold Vault.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.441]  At a future date.
[00:24:33.781 --> 00:24:36.704]  And then it talks about tracking the Tea Parties, tracking the militias.
[00:24:36.965 --> 00:24:38.927]  How they've got infiltrator groups in there.
[00:24:39.167 --> 00:24:42.470]  How the Army's working with federal and local law enforcement organizations.
[00:24:42.931 --> 00:24:45.694]  As these groups are armed and have combative training.
[00:24:46.154 --> 00:24:47.956]  And some are former military snipers.
[00:24:48.236 --> 00:24:50.318]  Some have made explosives training experience.
[00:24:51.739 --> 00:25:12.146]  And it goes on to talk about their exercise to take on the Tea Parties and take on the militias and they mix in white supremacist with it and then meanwhile Oklahoma passes bill outlawing militias saying you can't have a militia we're gonna just arrest you for that and this has got years in prison under it.
[00:25:12.646 --> 00:25:19.829]  I mean they are moving against the American people there is no doubt it just gets worse and worse and worse by the minute.
[00:25:21.155 --> 00:25:22.275]  This is a red alert!
[00:25:22.375 --> 00:25:36.520]  Good job Nemo getting this up, but I mean, we need to get Watson on this right now with headline, military training to take on tea parties, militias and others, listing former military as terrorist.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.560]  Okay, that is what this does.
[00:25:41.441 --> 00:25:43.282]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:08.673]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:26:10.614 --> 00:26:12.956]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:26:14.697 --> 00:26:16.638]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:26:19.111 --> 00:26:22.972]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:26:23.692 --> 00:26:26.853]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[00:26:27.534 --> 00:26:28.374]  Others don't.

[00:26:30.915 --> 00:26:32.435]  Diamond gusset jeans.

[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:47.780]  Others don't.
[00:26:52.808 --> 00:26:54.729]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:26:55.209 --> 00:26:58.090]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:26:59.751 --> 00:27:01.111]  Big Brother
[00:27:05.783 --> 00:27:06.824]  Mainstream media.
[00:27:07.565 --> 00:27:08.666]  Government cover-ups.
[00:27:09.327 --> 00:27:10.128]  You want answers?
[00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:11.850]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.094]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:16.655 --> 00:27:20.720]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:26.289]  Red alert!
[00:27:26.409 --> 00:27:26.910]  Red alert!
[00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:27.630]  Red alert!
[00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.911]  We've got it up on InfoWars.com.
[00:27:29.951 --> 00:27:31.892]  Kurt Nemo's got an article, Is the U.S.
[00:27:31.952 --> 00:27:33.453]  Army Training to Take on the Tea Party?
[00:27:33.893 --> 00:27:39.315]  Then it has links to mainstream news articles, mainstream newspapers, that are reporting it like it's good.
[00:27:40.796 --> 00:27:51.441]  Military regular army exercises with federal and local police around the country, where militia groups along with veterans are basically preparing to attack the government.
[00:27:52.694 --> 00:27:58.258]  And this integrates into this entire program of control that we see expanding.
[00:27:58.298 --> 00:28:00.380]  I have Dr. Bob Bowman who was on with us last week.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:01.821]  We re-aired it Sunday.
[00:28:01.841 --> 00:28:02.602]  I didn't do a live show.
[00:28:02.622 --> 00:28:03.883]  We'll be doing a live show this Sunday.
[00:28:03.903 --> 00:28:07.246]  And I wanted to get him on about solutions today and how to take the country back.
[00:28:07.566 --> 00:28:12.290]  But separately they had the secret space plane launch that he's an expert on, former head of the Star Wars program.
[00:28:13.531 --> 00:28:17.594]  This week, we were talking about it last week, then they had a secret launch this week, we'll talk more about that.
[00:28:17.914 --> 00:28:39.352]  We'll also get into solutions with him, but I just talked to him during the break, he joins us via video Skype here at PrisonPlanet.tv and on the radio, and so we're going to be talking to him first about the paramilitary militarization of police and all the documents we've gotten where NORTHCOM is preparing to take on the American people.
[00:28:40.332 --> 00:28:43.816]  Uh, and that their main target at NORTHCOM is the American people.
[00:28:43.836 --> 00:28:44.556]  This is illegal.
[00:28:44.937 --> 00:28:46.118]  This is unconstitutional.
[00:28:46.418 --> 00:28:49.160]  It violates posse comitatus that they have not completely removed.
[00:28:49.921 --> 00:28:55.986]  And I've got Watson doing a big boil-down article with some of the backstory on this, but this is so big and this just broke.
[00:28:58.008 --> 00:29:03.632]  We've already seen leaked documents that the in the Fed rallies, Ron Paul and myself are being watched by the army.
[00:29:03.972 --> 00:29:09.416]  They tell the army that don't let the in the Fedders know at the rallies that you're military or they may attack you.
[00:29:09.436 --> 00:29:12.738]  I mean, they are really getting ready to use the military against the American people.
[00:29:12.778 --> 00:29:15.700]  And our government has overthrown countless third world nations.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.681]  They're experts on this.
[00:29:17.041 --> 00:29:19.142]  When they have their druthers, they want a dictatorship.
[00:29:19.382 --> 00:29:20.763]  In other countries, they want it here.
[00:29:21.444 --> 00:29:22.485]  Presidents come and go.
[00:29:22.585 --> 00:29:25.266]  The tyranny of the military industrial complex only grows.
[00:29:25.927 --> 00:29:27.028]  Dr. Robert M. Bowman,
[00:29:27.768 --> 00:29:30.150]  Well, I'll just introduce him in the next segment, but let's go to him now.
[00:29:30.591 --> 00:29:35.154]  Dr. Bowman, I just started briefing you on this, but I know you're familiar with the backstory on this.
[00:29:35.435 --> 00:29:36.355]  Does this concern you?
[00:29:37.356 --> 00:29:38.357]  Well, of course it does.
[00:29:38.397 --> 00:29:40.339]  I've been speaking about this for years.
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:55.072]  The good news is they're not going to get away with it, because, you know, I've talked to a lot of military folks, and the majority, the vast majority, will not
[00:29:57.049 --> 00:30:17.496]  Well, let's talk about the history of this, Sean, and then I'm going to go over these new leaked documents to newspapers in Kentucky and other states, and the Army is confirming that these are real.
[00:30:18.237 --> 00:30:24.859]  But, I mean, this has got to be a wake-up call to the military, Dr. Bowman, that they're being trained to engage the American people.
[00:30:26.377 --> 00:30:48.132]  Yes it is and that's why organizations like the Oath Keepers is so important because we've got to teach the members of the military and law enforcement in this country about the Nuremberg Principles and about the Constitution and the fact that they have an absolute duty never to follow an order
[00:30:49.079 --> 00:31:01.478]  To engage in a war of aggression or to arrest, incarcerate, or disarm their fellow American citizens for simply exercising their constitutional right of dissent.
[00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:04.411]  This is incredible.
[00:31:04.711 --> 00:31:17.978]  And again, they just incrementally are acclimating us to be like Guatemala or Nigeria with just troops all over the streets and mobile naked body scanners and checkpoints and just everything else that is now happening.
[00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:21.580]  But we'll discuss Oath Keepers when we get back.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:22.821]  I know you've been involved with them.
[00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:23.982]  Here's Mother Jones.
[00:31:24.122 --> 00:31:25.703]  Oath Keepers in the age of treason.
[00:31:26.463 --> 00:31:30.984]  Meet the fast-growing Patriot group that's recruiting soldiers to resist the Obama administration.
[00:31:31.364 --> 00:31:32.405]  That's a complete lie.
[00:31:33.805 --> 00:31:35.386]  They're calling people to follow their oath.
[00:31:36.346 --> 00:31:38.327]  It's run by a former Ron Paul staffer.
[00:31:40.807 --> 00:31:44.028]  They're not calling for anything offensive.
[00:31:44.348 --> 00:31:49.510]  They're saying, follow your oath and we'll talk about the oath that the military and the police
[00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:50.731]  Give.
[00:31:51.132 --> 00:31:53.276]  If tyranny comes to your door, it comes in a uniform.
[00:31:53.296 --> 00:31:54.278]  Stay there, Dr. Bob Bowman.
[00:31:54.518 --> 00:31:57.504]  We'll be right back with our guest on the other side.
[00:31:58.827 --> 00:31:59.188]  Stay with us.
[00:32:03.792 --> 00:32:04.732]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:05.052 --> 00:32:08.774]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:08.934 --> 00:32:11.194]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:11.214 --> 00:32:16.676]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:17.096 --> 00:32:23.338]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:23.758 --> 00:32:29.302]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:29.742 --> 00:32:33.424]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:32:33.905 --> 00:32:37.927]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:38.207 --> 00:32:43.751]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:44.151 --> 00:32:47.153]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:47.693 --> 00:32:49.114]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:49.674 --> 00:32:50.115]  It's here.

[00:33:00.097 --> 00:33:02.718]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:33:03.118 --> 00:33:08.080]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.180]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:15.321]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:33:15.481 --> 00:33:16.462]  How much do you want?
[00:33:16.682 --> 00:33:17.402]  When do you want it?
[00:33:17.802 --> 00:33:19.403]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:33:19.683 --> 00:33:20.504]  When will you need it?
[00:33:20.744 --> 00:33:22.826]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:33:22.946 --> 00:33:24.067]  Will there be any food?
[00:33:24.287 --> 00:33:25.628]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:33:25.828 --> 00:33:30.891]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:33:31.092 --> 00:33:34.214]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:33:34.674 --> 00:33:38.176]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:33:38.496 --> 00:33:39.477]  How much will you need?
[00:33:39.717 --> 00:33:40.317]  We don't know.
[00:33:40.617 --> 00:33:41.518]  How much do you want?
[00:33:41.718 --> 00:33:42.458]  All you can get.
[00:33:42.658 --> 00:33:43.499]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:33:43.739 --> 00:33:46.500]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:34:41.935 --> 00:34:43.876]  Visit their link at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:44.296 --> 00:34:44.976]  Look for Max
[00:34:45.256 --> 00:34:48.919]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:48.939 --> 00:34:50.680]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:35:09.344 --> 00:35:25.932]  Scores of documents have fallen into our hands and have been reported by the mainstream news to be authentic, that the main enemy of the federal government is gun owners, returning veterans, libertarians, in the fetters, anti-war activists, and they're having drills all over the country.
[00:35:26.372 --> 00:35:28.613]  They're working with every local law enforcement group.
[00:35:28.633 --> 00:35:33.436]  This has been declassified that militias are going to attack police departments with IEDs,
[00:35:34.639 --> 00:35:55.447]  with explosives and we have this latest drill where they have Tea Party and uh... you basically in the Fed groups anti-fellow reserve groups that are going to protest and then it leads to that they're going to attack with militias and they mix white supremacist in with it in the drill and if you don't know the military psychology folks they drill you to
[00:35:57.308 --> 00:36:01.212]  To also prepare for the attack, but to also demonize the groups you're going to be fighting.
[00:36:01.813 --> 00:36:08.800]  Remember, it came out with these shooting drills at schools in Michigan, where they would say, homeschoolers against government education.
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:09.921]  That was the one group.
[00:36:10.221 --> 00:36:16.428]  Came in, didn't announce to the kids, it was the police posing as homeschooling parents, who were going to kill children.
[00:36:16.968 --> 00:36:19.271]  That's a way to demonize homeschoolers.
[00:36:19.331 --> 00:36:20.011]  It's asinine.
[00:36:21.172 --> 00:36:23.514]  And I can think of no better guest to talk about this.
[00:36:23.534 --> 00:36:25.055]  We're going to get into some other issues as well.
[00:36:25.435 --> 00:36:27.616]  There's Dr. Bob Bowman, Lieutenant Colonel, U.S.
[00:36:27.676 --> 00:36:39.623]  Air Force, retired, President of the Institute for Space and Security Studies, Executive Vice President, Millennium 3 Corporation, retired, presiding, and it just goes on and on here.
[00:36:39.643 --> 00:36:45.847]  He, 101 combat missions as a fighter pilot in Vietnam, the head of the DoD Star Wars programs under two presidents,
[00:36:46.707 --> 00:36:48.949]  And we appreciate him coming on.
[00:36:48.969 --> 00:36:53.994]  www.thepatriots.us is his website.
[00:36:54.454 --> 00:37:00.980]  Dr. Bob Bowman, recap what you were saying in the last segment and spend some time on this and your concerns and then you brought up...
[00:37:01.875 --> 00:37:06.418]  Oath keepers, and I have all these mainstream news articles saying they are treasonous.
[00:37:06.458 --> 00:37:07.299]  Here's Mother Jones.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.761]  Oath keepers in the age of treason.
[00:37:10.782 --> 00:37:22.270]  What all oath keepers are saying is we will not confiscate guns, we will not take people to FEMA camps, we will follow the Nuremberg Code, which isn't, I guess, even taught anymore to the military.
[00:37:22.931 --> 00:37:24.532]  Dr. Bob Bowman, good to have you here with us.
[00:37:25.489 --> 00:37:26.089]  Well, thank you.
[00:37:26.149 --> 00:37:36.832]  And you know, saying that Oath Keepers is against the Obama administration is ridiculous, because we started Oath Keepers way back under George W. Bush.
[00:37:38.413 --> 00:37:43.134]  This organization is not against any particular administration.
[00:37:43.914 --> 00:37:53.923]  This organization is sworn to follow their oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America.
[00:37:54.704 --> 00:38:03.632]  And these organizations, the military and law enforcement, are supposed to protect the Constitution and the people of the United States.
[00:38:04.352 --> 00:38:07.615]  And it doesn't matter who it is that's trying to
[00:38:10.134 --> 00:38:11.255]  Do the people in!
[00:38:12.375 --> 00:38:33.665]  And if they try and get the military and law enforcement to do it, and it seems like they're trying, they're trying to demonize the American people, and people like militias, and gun owners, and oath keepers, and 9-11 truthers, and goes on and on.
[00:38:35.606 --> 00:38:41.293]  I don't think they're going to succeed, but it's a real battle and it's one that
[00:38:42.974 --> 00:38:54.742]  I'm going to be engaged in with our organization, the Patriots, because I'm sure that with the name we have now, the Patriots, they're going to demonize us as well.
[00:38:55.843 --> 00:39:08.912]  And we're going to keep working with the Pentagon to inform them of the facts and their duty and how all this stuff fits in.
[00:39:10.032 --> 00:39:12.114]  As you know, three years ago,
[00:39:13.034 --> 00:39:24.419]  I sent a letter to the generals and admirals of the Pentagon saying that they must not attack Iran and if anybody orders them to do it, they should arrest whoever did it as a war criminal.
[00:39:25.839 --> 00:39:33.362]  In the same way now, I'm going to be sending a letter reminding them that the American people are not their enemy.
[00:39:33.402 --> 00:39:39.145]  And if somebody orders them to round up Americans, dissenters, though we may be,
[00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:45.570]  They must not only refuse that order, but consider arresting whoever gave it.
[00:39:46.954 --> 00:39:47.654]  Absolutely.
[00:39:47.674 --> 00:40:02.938]  For someone who studied history, for someone who's been a military officer commanding the Star Wars system, I mean this was always taught 101 to even low-level officers that in a tyranny they try to use the military against the people.
[00:40:03.518 --> 00:40:06.119]  This is called a military-industrial complex coup.
[00:40:06.639 --> 00:40:09.519]  This is, anyone that does this is engaged in treason.
[00:40:09.979 --> 00:40:15.981]  And now the Oath Keepers have their ten pledges that are all right out of the Bill of Rights, all right out of the Constitution.
[00:40:17.001 --> 00:40:38.164]  And to then demonize them and to have mock drills where it says, you know, it starts out with a Tea Party protest against the Federal Reserve in these documents, and then it leads to former military people trying to sniper troops in the drill, and so they're teaching the military that the American people are going to try to kill you!
[00:40:38.884 --> 00:40:52.903]  I mean this is amazing brainwashing and it really shows us clearly just another example of what's going on inside the Justice Department, inside the Pentagon, inside local police that are part of this drill to take on the American people.
[00:40:52.923 --> 00:40:53.944]  I mean they are clearly
[00:40:55.025 --> 00:41:00.647]  Quietly building this system for the American people, saying it was for outside groups, just as Hitler did.
[00:41:01.067 --> 00:41:05.528]  And now they're openly getting their people ready to go up against the American people.
[00:41:05.568 --> 00:41:10.729]  And as we talked about last week, Dr. Bowman, Colonel Bowman, I believe they're going to stage false flags.
[00:41:10.749 --> 00:41:16.231]  We see the preparatory brainwashing in the media for this against government installations, military bases, you name it.
[00:41:17.231 --> 00:41:24.877]  To then create the self-fulfilling prophecy to sick a martial law scenario on the population.
[00:41:24.917 --> 00:41:27.139]  I mean, we're two minutes to midnight now.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.020]  Yeah.
[00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:32.970]  Yeah, I think they very well may try it.
[00:41:33.631 --> 00:41:41.014]  But again, there are high-ranking people in the military that are aware of this stuff.
[00:41:41.694 --> 00:41:54.779]  And just like back when it was Iran that Cheney and company was trying to attack, there are going to be people up there that say, not on my watch.
[00:41:56.018 --> 00:41:56.378]  Well, yeah.
[00:41:56.458 --> 00:42:02.982]  I mean, talk about Fox Fallon, the head of CENTCOM, resigned and said, I'm not going to launch an illegal attack on Iran.
[00:42:03.483 --> 00:42:04.283]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:42:04.683 --> 00:42:05.144]  That's right.
[00:42:05.364 --> 00:42:07.445]  And there's going to be more people like him.
[00:42:08.366 --> 00:42:16.991]  Well, for those who don't know, who don't know military history, international law, attacking a country first, I mean, that is one of the greatest crimes you can commit.
[00:42:17.011 --> 00:42:18.292]  That's right.
[00:42:18.992 --> 00:42:23.175]  And we, of course, we've already done it twice recently in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:42:25.444 --> 00:42:31.127]  Claiming that they carried out 9-11, and of course, just in a nutshell, Colonel, what happened on 9-11?
[00:42:33.168 --> 00:42:44.473]  Well, we don't know, really, who did it, but we can be doggone sure that it wasn't nineteen Arabs with box cutters and an old man in a cave on a dialysis machine.
[00:42:45.373 --> 00:42:52.657]  We know that there was a lot more to it than that, that those demonized enemies could not
[00:42:53.297 --> 00:43:20.163]  have uh... uh... sidelined our whole air defense system uh... they could not have pre-wired the buildings with uh... nano thermite to bring them down in a controlled demolition fashion uh... they they just couldn't have done it and uh... we know for sure official conspiracy theory that the bush administration put together is totally impossible uh...
[00:43:22.691 --> 00:43:32.388]  On 9-11 we had the greatest crime of the century and perhaps of recent time.
[00:43:33.812 --> 00:43:41.238]  And we still don't know who did it, because the 9-11 Commission wasn't asked to find out who did it.
[00:43:41.318 --> 00:43:49.885]  As a matter of fact, we now know that they were specifically told not to ask that question, not to worry about who did it.
[00:43:49.965 --> 00:43:54.769]  They said, you know, we know who did it, just tell us, you know, where intelligence failed.
[00:43:58.484 --> 00:44:01.465]  The important thing is what happened after 9-11.
[00:44:02.105 --> 00:44:15.969]  Because after 9-11, the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan offered to give us Osama Bin Laden if we had evidence against him so that we could put him on trial for 9-11.
[00:44:16.569 --> 00:44:22.530]  And of course the Bush administration ignored that offer of the Taliban for two reasons.
[00:44:23.251 --> 00:44:24.471]  One, of course, they had
[00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:29.126]  No evidence against Osama Bin Laden and still don't.
[00:44:29.426 --> 00:44:36.634]  They probably knew at that point who did it and of course are covering it all up and protecting whoever did it.
[00:44:37.814 --> 00:44:50.202]  And secondly, they had already planned in detail the invasion of Afghanistan because Afghanistan wouldn't give UNICAL a gas pipeline.
[00:44:50.322 --> 00:45:00.589]  In fact, the BBC and Associated Press have reported that in the three months before 9-11, tens of thousands of US and British troops were massed in the stands around Afghanistan.
[00:45:00.849 --> 00:45:02.150]  The carriers were in place.
[00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:06.093]  It takes months to get an invasion like that ready in Bush on September 10th.
[00:45:06.593 --> 00:45:14.118]  According to Newsweek, signed the attack order to launch the attack in the next two weeks on September 10th, the day before it happened.
[00:45:14.158 --> 00:45:17.780]  And Jeb Bush, AP reported, was preparing for martial law in Florida.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:26.906]  And expanding on that, originally a real letter was put out by Bin Laden and a statement that was confirmed to be authentic, that he did not do it.
[00:45:27.206 --> 00:45:33.370]  But then they had all these fake websites and fake videos that have been proven to be fake, where he said that he did do it.
[00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:34.651]  And now they'll have a
[00:45:34.991 --> 00:45:35.211]  Yeah.
[00:45:35.311 --> 00:45:35.512]  Yeah.
[00:45:47.685 --> 00:45:50.408]  They're trying to pull the wool over our eyes.
[00:45:50.488 --> 00:45:51.369]  They keep doing it.
[00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:59.197]  And guys like you and me, Alex, we have to just keep telling the truth, because only the truth can protect us.
[00:45:59.457 --> 00:46:06.143]  Well, when we come back, I want to get into solutions and the Patriots.us and some of the things you're doing and Oath Keepers and a lot more.
[00:46:06.784 --> 00:46:08.566]  But this just broke in the last 30 minutes.
[00:46:10.848 --> 00:46:22.595]  Which just adds to the giant stack of other government documents we've gotten where they have been secretly training the military for more than two decades to take on American gun owners.
[00:46:22.735 --> 00:46:27.477]  I mean, I've interviewed former Marine Corps captain back in 2001.
[00:46:30.719 --> 00:46:37.724]  Uh, and the last straw for him was when he drove through an army checkpoint on I-35 and they were searching cars right here in Austin.
[00:46:37.744 --> 00:46:38.484]  It was in Kyle.
[00:46:38.964 --> 00:46:40.065]  So he went ahead and went public.
[00:46:40.345 --> 00:46:48.890]  How in 88, 89, he was leading teams with police raiding American gun owners in Virginia as part of a secret program.
[00:46:49.691 --> 00:46:52.432]  Uh, and of course now we've got a lot of documents proving that.
[00:46:52.452 --> 00:46:57.696]  Uh, and I interviewed a colonel last year who admitted they were doing gun confiscation drills in Iowa.
[00:46:58.016 --> 00:46:59.597]  So they are preparing to come.
[00:47:00.831 --> 00:47:01.712]  Global meltdowns.
[00:47:02.072 --> 00:47:03.113]  Massive unemployment.
[00:47:03.474 --> 00:47:04.274]  Endless wars.
[00:47:04.695 --> 00:47:05.936]  A new currency crisis.
[00:47:06.337 --> 00:47:08.078]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[00:47:08.419 --> 00:47:10.280]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:47:10.581 --> 00:47:12.202]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[00:47:12.483 --> 00:47:14.184]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[00:47:14.565 --> 00:47:16.146]  Introducing Off The Grid News.
[00:47:16.547 --> 00:47:21.812]  A weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly
[00:47:25.145 --> 00:47:27.967]  Preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.

[00:47:42.717 --> 00:47:43.377]  And the best part?

[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.521]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:48:02.601 --> 00:48:04.821]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:48:04.921 --> 00:48:07.742]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:48:08.122 --> 00:48:12.884]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:48:13.244 --> 00:48:17.425]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:48:17.745 --> 00:48:20.107]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:48:20.207 --> 00:48:22.608]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:48:22.628 --> 00:48:25.530]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:33.495]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:48:33.815 --> 00:48:39.058]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:48:39.218 --> 00:48:41.499]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:48:42.059 --> 00:48:45.501]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:48:45.761 --> 00:48:46.661]  And I got news for you.
[00:48:46.821 --> 00:48:48.122]  You're everyone else.
[00:48:48.162 --> 00:48:49.163]  Invisible Empire.

[00:50:02.755 --> 00:50:04.977]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:50:05.297 --> 00:50:07.118]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:50:07.378 --> 00:50:08.599]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:50:08.999 --> 00:50:12.202]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:50:12.602 --> 00:50:17.445]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:50:17.826 --> 00:50:21.148]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:50:21.636 --> 00:50:22.957]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:50:23.317 --> 00:50:25.918]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[00:50:26.178 --> 00:50:29.140]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:37.645]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:50:37.925 --> 00:50:42.307]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[00:51:09.192 --> 00:51:12.733]  More than 2,000 years ago, the Roman Republic fell.
[00:51:13.634 --> 00:51:18.055]  It officially fell in 410, hundreds of years later.
[00:51:18.095 --> 00:51:22.377]  But the Republic that had some level of freedom fell
[00:51:23.462 --> 00:51:30.292]  When Julius Caesar marched his troops into Italy, across the Rubicon, it was illegal, it was high treason to do so.
[00:51:30.673 --> 00:51:33.316]  They wouldn't even allow troops in the country.
[00:51:34.616 --> 00:51:36.317]  They wouldn't allow them in the city of Rome.
[00:51:37.078 --> 00:51:53.451]  They have known for thousands of years that when you have a standing army in the country, that's why the founding father said it was illegal, couldn't be used inside the country, that's why the Posse Comitatus Act 1878 says it's illegal, every time, look at Latin America where they're always having the military take over, look at Eastern Europe, look at Asia.
[00:51:54.151 --> 00:51:57.413]  And we know they're using the military illegally.
[00:51:57.453 --> 00:52:00.074]  They've set up NORTHCOM, made us a military jurisdiction.
[00:52:00.555 --> 00:52:08.099]  And now we know they're drilling and training, and the FBI admits the main target is gun-owning Americans, conservatives, libertarians.
[00:52:08.539 --> 00:52:13.922]  Dr. Bob Bowman, how do you see them trying to go hot with this?
[00:52:15.142 --> 00:52:15.882]  Stage terror?
[00:52:15.942 --> 00:52:16.523]  False flag?
[00:52:16.543 --> 00:52:23.665]  I mean, what are some of the scenarios and what should we do if we see a federal building blown up or, God forbid, a nuke detonated?
[00:52:23.685 --> 00:52:26.086]  We know Obama's people are now floating that.
[00:52:27.046 --> 00:52:27.967]  Attack Iran?
[00:52:28.527 --> 00:52:31.208]  Stage domestic attacks to go after domestic groups?
[00:52:31.568 --> 00:52:33.208]  I see it all happening as a combo.
[00:52:35.089 --> 00:52:42.792]  Well, sure, we have to be prepared for any of that and one of the great things about the 9-11 Truth Movement is that
[00:52:44.716 --> 00:53:04.342]  In digging into all of this, we're watching now, and they know that we're watching, and that's why they may be deterred from some of these crazy schemes and new false flags, because they know we're liable to catch them red-handed, and we will.
[00:53:05.162 --> 00:53:08.183]  So, we've got to watch for that.
[00:53:08.823 --> 00:53:11.204]  If something happens,
[00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:25.616]  The American people have to know that before they think, oh yes, it's some crazy Muslim group or it's a militia.
[00:53:27.617 --> 00:53:27.977]  No, no.
[00:53:28.477 --> 00:53:32.699]  They've got to think that it could be insiders in the
[00:53:35.282 --> 00:54:04.293]  military and intelligence establishment a rogue group uh... associated with our government and uh... uh... we have to make sure that the people know that that's a possibility so that uh... when these things happen uh... they don't automatically knee-jerk into uh... yeah let's go get those people whoever they're told uh... are the bad guys
[00:54:05.964 --> 00:54:17.677]  Well, you're absolutely right, and they're going to need a Gulf of Tonkin, or an Operation Ajax, or a Glywyds, or a Reichstag, or an Oklahoma City, or a 9-11, to launch their new war against the American people.
[00:54:17.717 --> 00:54:22.863]  But we know in any military planning, with the local police and the feds, with the FBI,
[00:54:23.664 --> 00:54:25.746]  That it takes years of planning and preparation.
[00:54:25.766 --> 00:54:27.527]  That's how we've known that this was coming.
[00:54:27.547 --> 00:54:39.376]  And I said it would start in 2010, 2011, because I could see all the preparation building towards this invasion, basically, of the American people by the military.
[00:54:39.556 --> 00:54:42.118]  And that's what Oath Keepers recognized several years ago.
[00:54:42.919 --> 00:54:44.860]  And that's what you've recognized for many years.
[00:54:45.621 --> 00:54:47.822]  And they have certainly crossed the Rubicon.
[00:54:48.303 --> 00:54:51.145]  The question is, will they be successful in bringing down the Republic?
[00:54:53.035 --> 00:54:55.937]  That indeed is the question, and my answer is hell no.
[00:54:56.017 --> 00:54:58.679]  They're not going to be successful because we're not going to let them.
[00:55:01.481 --> 00:55:10.527]  Dr. Bob Bowman, there may come a time very soon, and they're announcing North Com through cyber security can shut down the web.
[00:55:11.488 --> 00:55:17.011]  We're rapidly approaching a time and date where we may not even be on the air if they launch this full operation.
[00:55:17.672 --> 00:55:22.175]  And I just really hope people are taking this information extremely seriously.
[00:55:24.107 --> 00:55:44.838]  That's right, we have to use whatever we've got, the internet, the independent stations and networks like yours, our newsletters, our contacts, local access television, whatever we can use to spread the word.
[00:55:45.598 --> 00:55:49.781]  And we have to educate ourselves and our friends and our neighbors and our families
[00:55:50.561 --> 00:55:54.404]  And our communities, by any means possible.
[00:55:54.724 --> 00:56:02.290]  I ask people who've subscribed to my newsletter to send us a list of people that you'd like to get educated.
[00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:07.514]  We'll give them a free trial subscription, both by paper and email.
[00:56:09.522 --> 00:56:10.783]  We've got to get the word out.
[00:56:10.824 --> 00:56:13.006]  We've got to reach as many people as we can.
[00:56:14.187 --> 00:56:22.236]  We also want people around the country to form chapters of the Patriots just as we get chapters of both keepers.
[00:56:22.777 --> 00:56:30.045]  We've got to reach out to people all across the political spectrum and our members run the gamut from the
[00:56:30.585 --> 00:56:36.990]  The militia folks on the far right to the anti-war people on the far left.
[00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:38.451]  All across the political spectrum.
[00:56:38.471 --> 00:56:39.832]  Dr. Bob Bowman, stay there.
[00:56:39.892 --> 00:56:43.195]  Let's talk about solutions when we come back.
[00:56:43.655 --> 00:56:48.579]  And then I want to open the phones up for people in the military right now that are concerned.
[00:56:50.321 --> 00:56:51.221]  We're on the march.
[00:56:51.702 --> 00:56:53.323]  The empire's on the run.
[00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:56.946]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.716 --> 00:57:02.038]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:57:02.058 --> 00:57:04.319]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:57:04.419 --> 00:57:07.201]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:57:07.642 --> 00:57:12.385]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:57:12.745 --> 00:57:16.928]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:57:17.248 --> 00:57:19.572]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:57:19.592 --> 00:57:22.135]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:57:22.496 --> 00:57:25.039]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:33.011]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:57:33.328 --> 00:57:38.613]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:57:38.733 --> 00:57:41.516]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:57:41.576 --> 00:57:45.019]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:46.201]  And I got news for you.
[00:57:46.341 --> 00:57:47.642]  You're everyone else.

[00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:00.930]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:06.332]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:06.572 --> 00:58:11.194]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:58:11.594 --> 00:58:11.974]  It's true.
[00:58:12.054 --> 00:58:16.616]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:58:17.156 --> 00:58:21.859]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:24.301]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:58:24.701 --> 00:58:29.304]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:58:29.504 --> 00:58:30.405]  And here's the best part.
[00:58:30.605 --> 00:58:33.387]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:58:33.687 --> 00:58:36.989]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:40.151]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:58:40.492 --> 00:58:42.393]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:58:42.713 --> 00:58:43.634]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:58:47.276 --> 00:58:48.297]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:58:48.717 --> 00:58:56.024]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:58:56.344 --> 00:58:58.787]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:58:59.427 --> 00:59:04.752]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:59:04.792 --> 00:59:07.534]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:59:07.554 --> 00:59:12.058]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:59:12.864 --> 00:59:17.327]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[00:59:33.519 --> 00:59:35.080]  This film needs to be seen.

[00:59:47.294 --> 00:59:48.034]  Shadow Government.
[00:59:48.714 --> 00:59:50.115]  It gives Big Brother a black eye.
[00:59:50.935 --> 00:59:54.196]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:00:04.793 --> 01:00:05.853]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:00:06.193 --> 01:00:08.534]  As we defend the Republic, I have cleared the phone lines.
[01:00:08.594 --> 01:00:19.238]  I apologize to other callers who were holding, but I want to have the phones open for military and police who have been part of drills to take on the American people.
[01:00:19.278 --> 01:00:23.080]  Now, it's been in the news, this has been going on for years, but more and more is coming out.
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:27.661]  They could just have dry exercises where combatants try to attack military bases.
[01:00:28.502 --> 01:00:31.903]  But no, they say tea parties, gun owners, former veterans.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:37.064]  And we have the MIAC and Homeland Security reports that law enforcement sent me.
[01:00:37.204 --> 01:00:39.106]  We broke both those last year.
[01:00:39.126 --> 01:00:41.549]  I mean, the point is we're on top of this, okay?
[01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:47.936]  And to even talk about this subject, I can't even give you all the data in one show.
[01:00:48.496 --> 01:00:49.317]  It's so ridiculous.
[01:00:49.377 --> 01:00:53.300]  I called Watson 30 minutes ago, and he's great at boil-down articles.
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:01:00.945]  Nemo has an excellent article just on this latest development at InfoWars.com, where the military's training to take on the Tea Party as terrorists.
[01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:02.106]  We already know that.
[01:01:02.366 --> 01:01:06.069]  They got sound cannons, microwave guns they're rolling out now at events.
[01:01:06.389 --> 01:01:08.490]  They're trying to say we're all racist to demonize us.
[01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:09.651]  That's not working.
[01:01:09.731 --> 01:01:11.473]  They're globalizing the U.S.
[01:01:11.493 --> 01:01:17.297]  They're trying to get rid of our borders, bring in G20 control, value-added taxes, total oppression.
[01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:22.332]  And ladies and gentlemen, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:01:22.872 --> 01:01:25.373]  Two hours, 20 plus minutes long, 30 minutes of extras.
[01:01:25.393 --> 01:01:27.535]  When you purchase it, it supports this show.
[01:01:28.575 --> 01:01:30.276]  What's 30 minutes of the two hour film?
[01:01:30.356 --> 01:01:31.116]  It's the G20.
[01:01:31.757 --> 01:01:35.739]  Military snatching and grabbing protesters off the streets, putting them in cars.
[01:01:36.876 --> 01:01:43.439]  Uh, my camera guys go up to the military peacefully and say, we want to interview your public affairs officer.
[01:01:43.879 --> 01:01:44.900]  We have your press release.
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:46.561]  And they said, go park over there.
[01:01:46.581 --> 01:01:48.522]  Then they came over and said, we're not going to talk to you.
[01:01:48.562 --> 01:01:48.842]  Leave.
[01:01:49.867 --> 01:01:59.679]  And it was eight o'clock at night, and then they called the police and said we were trying to blow up the military base, and the police showed up and said, we're going to say you're terrorists.
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:00.901]  You ran.
[01:02:00.961 --> 01:02:01.942]  You were sneaking around.
[01:02:02.102 --> 01:02:02.643]  All lies.
[01:02:02.703 --> 01:02:04.585]  So just out of hand, we're terrorists.
[01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:06.347]  They've all been taught we're the enemy.
[01:02:07.108 --> 01:02:14.734]  They've been taught, and Gerald Cilente thinks they will fire on citizens, that they will do it, especially after the Feds blow up a military base and blame it on us.
[01:02:14.774 --> 01:02:21.359]  And we now have the government blocking Congress's subpoenas on the shooter at Fort Hood.
[01:02:21.599 --> 01:02:22.760]  That was done during a drill.
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:34.889]  We know that the Hattari militia thing was a setup, and they had Feds inside provocateuring it to create a news headline that, oh, the militias are about to attack, to coincide with the false flags.
[01:02:35.549 --> 01:02:40.853]  We cover it all in Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:02:40.893 --> 01:02:44.315]  Get it, make copies of it, give it to everyone you know, air it on AXS TV.
[01:02:44.755 --> 01:02:49.318]  Invisible Empire, No Order Defined, shows you who these criminals are, how they're running these systems.
[01:02:49.358 --> 01:02:51.480]  Two new films, released in the month of April.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.141]  Get them, get them out to everybody.
[01:02:53.201 --> 01:02:57.063]  InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:02:57.363 --> 01:03:02.487]  Now for military and police, this hour into the next, I want to go back to Dr. Bob Bowman,
[01:03:02.967 --> 01:03:10.035]  Specifically, who've been in these drills, or talked to other officers that were in these drills, with the military, with police, with the feds, totally illegal.
[01:03:11.777 --> 01:03:17.183]  We know the military sent us the document that was later confirmed to be real last year, that Ron Paul events are being watched by the army.
[01:03:17.864 --> 01:03:18.964]  Call into the show.
[01:03:19.024 --> 01:03:20.045]  Call in from a pay phone.
[01:03:20.325 --> 01:03:21.085]  Whatever you want.
[01:03:21.385 --> 01:03:22.005]  Call in.
[01:03:22.586 --> 01:03:24.386]  Tell us what is going on.
[01:03:25.086 --> 01:03:29.888]  Give us your concern, or even if you haven't been part of these drills, if you have a concern about this.
[01:03:29.948 --> 01:03:34.430]  How many years have I told you this is being set up for the American people?
[01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:39.471]  We've got to raise the alarm now, and that's what police state for the rise of FEMA does.
[01:03:39.732 --> 01:03:40.652]  You can call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:49.920]  888-253-3139 or write to me, Alex Jones, PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:03:51.101 --> 01:03:53.665]  Dr. Bob Bowman has been a huge supporter of Oath Keepers.
[01:03:54.025 --> 01:03:58.590]  Perhaps, Dr. Bowman, you should explain, that guys print me the 10 pledges of Oath Keepers that's on their site.
[01:04:00.953 --> 01:04:14.545]  Let's go over that, and then the organization you've launched, and the speaking tour you've done around the country, reaching hundreds of thousands of people, and where this is going, and how people can get involved in thepatriots.us.
[01:04:16.086 --> 01:04:26.876]  Okay, well, we're an organization that is all across the political spectrum, and we want a peaceful revolution to restore the Republic.
[01:04:28.103 --> 01:04:38.026]  The way things are going, they're heading us toward violent revolution, and we don't want that.
[01:04:38.746 --> 01:04:53.891]  So the only way to have a peaceful revolution is to make sure that enough people in the military and law enforcement understand what's at stake, understand what their oath means,
[01:04:54.731 --> 01:05:06.916]  And wind up on our side, the side of the people, not the side of a few crazies in the government that tell them to do something stupid like round us up and throw us in FEMA camps.
[01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:11.858]  So that's in the short term, but we have to have a long-term solution to
[01:05:14.699 --> 01:05:18.343]  Bring about this peaceful revolution and electoral solution.
[01:05:19.244 --> 01:05:29.775]  And so we're asking all of our chapters to groom candidates to run in both the Democratic and Republican primaries for Congress.
[01:05:30.255 --> 01:05:36.521]  We eventually have to vote out all of the members of Congress that are not on side of the people.
[01:05:37.282 --> 01:05:44.849]  And, you know, the number that are on the side of the people and following the Constitution are very few.
[01:05:44.869 --> 01:05:50.053]  I mean, we've got Ron Paul, Dennis Kucinich, Alan Grayson, you know, just a very few.
[01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:59.601]  But if your particular representative is one of the vast majority that's on the take,
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:12.447]  And supporting the giant corporations and the global terrorists that want to take over our country, and they're grabbing it now.
[01:06:14.088 --> 01:06:16.890]  If that's the case, then you have to vote them out.
[01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:25.755]  We have to vote out every incumbent that is not one of the handful that is really trying to serve the people.
[01:06:26.436 --> 01:06:30.198]  And to do that, we can no longer just
[01:06:32.415 --> 01:06:40.882]  Uh, go to the polls as greens or libertarians or independents or write-in candidates.
[01:06:41.323 --> 01:06:48.009]  We have to take over the Republican and Democratic parties from within because the system is stacked in their favor.
[01:06:48.909 --> 01:06:50.951]  And so that's what we're trying to do.
[01:06:52.012 --> 01:06:52.573]  And, uh,
[01:06:54.093 --> 01:07:02.179]  Our members of the Patriots, members of our chapters, are going to be running for Congress as Republicans and Democrats.
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:08.543]  Hopefully we get a few of them running in 2010 and a lot more in 2012 and see what we can do.
[01:07:15.888 --> 01:07:22.531]  Hold their feet to the fire when we get somebody in and make sure that they don't wind up on the take like everybody else.
[01:07:23.312 --> 01:07:28.974]  And we demand the changes, the real changes that we need in this country.
[01:07:29.175 --> 01:07:35.838]  And there's massive, there's massive, to interrupt, massive grassroots concern and involvement.
[01:07:35.878 --> 01:07:37.539]  People are really getting off the bench now.
[01:07:37.979 --> 01:07:43.882]  And so now is the time for the Campaign for Liberty, for your organization, for Oath Keepers, for everybody,
[01:07:44.622 --> 01:07:54.105]  For the listeners of this broadcast, for We Are Change, for InfoWarriors, to get the word out, like the life of this country depends on it, because the global takeover is happening right now.
[01:07:54.125 --> 01:08:04.848]  And I do want to just have you continue, but I wanted to throw this out for military, for police, to get their concern about the fact that they're being openly trained to take on the American people.
[01:08:04.948 --> 01:08:13.471]  Either your concerns or what you've witnessed, we'll cover it all, but let me give that toll-free number out to military and police and others.
[01:08:14.231 --> 01:08:15.953]  Only, the phones are wide open for you.
[01:08:15.973 --> 01:08:16.313]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:16.333 --> 01:08:16.413]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:16.433 --> 01:08:20.856]  And here's that number again, if you're driving along in your squad car, or you're on leave and listening.
[01:08:20.876 --> 01:08:20.936]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:20.976 --> 01:08:22.317]  Please continue, Dr. Bob Bowman.
[01:08:36.192 --> 01:08:48.110]  Yeah, well, we eventually have to take over the government so that we have a government that follows the Constitution, honors the truth, and serves the people.
[01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:51.394]  Those are essential ingredients of a
[01:08:53.357 --> 01:08:53.597]  Yes.
[01:09:14.412 --> 01:09:34.752]  uh... once we do then we can demand an end to the corporate wars cut off all the funding bring our troops home uh... from all the hundred and fifty hundred and seventy hundred eighty countries they're stationed in around the world give give the bases back to the home countries and use our military only
[01:09:35.413 --> 01:09:38.515]  for protecting our borders and our people.
[01:09:39.016 --> 01:09:41.237]  That is their constitutional mission.
[01:09:41.698 --> 01:09:44.039]  That's their only constitutional mission.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:10:00.631]  And if we make that one change in military policy to eliminate the mission of protecting the global financial interests of multinational corporations, we can greatly enhance our national security.
[01:10:01.184 --> 01:10:20.241]  and simultaneously reduce the defense budget by eighty percent that's a step toward fiscal responsibility and i think it's worth thinking about that's just one change that can be made when we get a government follows the constitution honors the truth and serves the people let's be clear
[01:10:21.104 --> 01:10:23.425]  We're not talking about just status quo.
[01:10:23.485 --> 01:10:24.486]  Are people going to stand up?
[01:10:24.566 --> 01:10:25.426]  Are they going to get involved?
[01:10:25.446 --> 01:10:28.428]  Are they going to say no to the current corruption?
[01:10:28.728 --> 01:10:33.511]  The way tyranny works is it only gets worse and worse until you stop it and then reverse it.
[01:10:33.951 --> 01:10:39.254]  And so we are going down the slippery slope here very, very, very fast right now.
[01:10:39.774 --> 01:10:41.535]  And the time is up.
[01:10:41.595 --> 01:10:47.658]  I mean, in your educated opinion, former head of Star Wars program, Air Force colonel, researcher,
[01:10:49.099 --> 01:11:02.185]  Looking at history, looking at what's happened, looking at what the people running our government have done in other nations, do you have any doubt that they're attempting to set up a open, oppressive, hot, despotic system?
[01:11:02.225 --> 01:11:11.189]  By hot, for those that don't know, no longer just a cold, creeping tyranny, but an aggressive, jack-booted, in-your-face tyranny.
[01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:14.651]  No, they're certainly heading in that direction.
[01:11:14.731 --> 01:11:16.072]  There are elements, and
[01:11:16.969 --> 01:11:19.653]  Again, I think they're in the minority.
[01:11:19.673 --> 01:11:28.948]  They're certainly a small minority of the population, but unfortunately, they seem to be in the majority in Washington, D.C.
[01:11:32.307 --> 01:11:52.876]  This small minority certainly has control of major elements of our government, and we need to cut those strings, we need to get big money out of politics, we need to take our government back so that it starts serving us again, and besides ending
[01:11:54.270 --> 01:12:11.447]  uh... the wars we also must demand we get the return of our full constitutional rights we do away with that patriot act the military commissions act and all the other acts and and uh... executive orders
[01:12:12.208 --> 01:12:15.311]  That have tried to take away our constitutional rights.
[01:12:15.371 --> 01:12:20.076]  And by the way, all of those acts are unconstitutional.
[01:12:20.777 --> 01:12:28.384]  Congress does not have the power to take away the rights that are given us in the first ten amendments, the Bill of Rights.
[01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:31.407]  They can't take those away by just passing the law.
[01:12:32.088 --> 01:12:35.713]  They have to pass an amendment to the Constitution, get it ratified by the states.
[01:12:36.153 --> 01:12:39.017]  Of course, that hasn't happened, and that won't happen.
[01:12:39.618 --> 01:12:42.041]  So, we don't have to follow the Patriot Act.
[01:12:42.101 --> 01:12:44.343]  We don't have to follow the Military Commissions Act.
[01:12:44.704 --> 01:12:46.887]  Those things are totally unconstitutional.
[01:12:48.294 --> 01:12:52.178]  All right, Dr. Bob Bowman, I was about to go to some calls.
[01:12:52.218 --> 01:12:55.260]  We had some concerned military people on the line and they hung up.
[01:12:55.681 --> 01:13:04.048]  Again, we can always load the phones with the people on any issue, except sometimes I specifically want certain people to be able to call in.
[01:13:04.749 --> 01:13:09.093]  Former military that's concerned, current military, people that have been involved in these drills.
[01:13:09.793 --> 01:13:11.253]  For those that just joined us, U.S.
[01:13:11.293 --> 01:13:15.974]  military is training with police nationwide to take on the Tea Parties.
[01:13:16.274 --> 01:13:22.096]  They're brainwashing police that the Tea Parties and returning veterans are going to attack them with guns.
[01:13:22.636 --> 01:13:24.336]  And they're claiming that we're white supremacists.
[01:13:24.416 --> 01:13:25.356]  It's all mixed in.
[01:13:26.096 --> 01:13:27.857]  And the military did leak these documents.
[01:13:27.877 --> 01:13:29.717]  The military admits they were doing these drills.
[01:13:30.157 --> 01:13:33.638]  So the good news is the military is concerned and is leaking these.
[01:13:34.058 --> 01:13:36.278]  But I want to get people's take on this.
[01:13:36.298 --> 01:13:36.338]  1-800-259.
[01:13:39.259 --> 01:13:50.123]  I mean, don't tell me that our military and our police are so cowed listening out there that you're so afraid of the NSA that you're not going to call in and tell us your concern.
[01:13:51.003 --> 01:13:55.285]  The government's main focus in the real drills and preparation
[01:13:56.065 --> 01:14:00.029]  Isn't just for the American people and Tea Party folks and in the fetters.
[01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:03.333]  It is for gun-owning veterans who have military training.
[01:14:03.553 --> 01:14:06.356]  That is in both the drills held the 23rd and 26th.
[01:14:07.297 --> 01:14:07.658]  Okay?
[01:14:07.958 --> 01:14:13.864]  And this is part of NLEO-10 going on, where NLEO-9 admitted they're using foreign assets in the drills.
[01:14:14.165 --> 01:14:14.985]  Foreign troops.
[01:14:15.686 --> 01:14:17.207]  In these drills to go up against you.
[01:14:17.527 --> 01:14:18.767]  This is the high treason.
[01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:21.849]  This is serious what's going on all over the country.
[01:14:22.049 --> 01:14:23.910]  That's what the state's terror attacks are about.
[01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:25.451]  That's what this whole system is about.
[01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:29.452]  And we've got mainstream media claiming the Oath Keepers are treasonous.
[01:14:30.253 --> 01:14:32.774]  This is fully disgusting.
[01:14:33.234 --> 01:14:35.255]  I mean, this is absolutely disgusting.
[01:14:35.275 --> 01:14:36.856]  Let me just read what Oath Keeper stands for.
[01:14:37.156 --> 01:14:39.517]  We will not obey any order to disarm the American people.
[01:14:39.897 --> 01:14:48.301]  We will not obey any order to conduct warrantless searches of the American people, their homes, vehicles, papers, and effects, such as warrantless house-to-house searches for weapons, as you saw in Louisiana.
[01:14:49.061 --> 01:14:55.144]  Number three, we will not obey any order to detain American citizens as unlawful enemy combatants or to subject them to trial by military tribunal.
[01:14:56.564 --> 01:15:00.266]  We will not obey orders to impose martial law or state of emergency or a state
[01:15:01.613 --> 01:15:07.038]  on a state or to enter by force into a state without the express consent of the invitation of the state's legislator or governor.
[01:15:07.318 --> 01:15:09.800]  What's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act?
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.842]  It talks about putting down governors.
[01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:15.325]  See the state saying no now to government takeover?
[01:15:16.874 --> 01:15:26.098]  Number five, we will not obey orders to invade and subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty and declares national government to be in violation of the compact to which the state entered the Union.
[01:15:26.118 --> 01:15:31.481]  Number six, we will not obey any order to blockade American cities, thus turning them into giant concentration camps.
[01:15:31.501 --> 01:15:42.666]  Seven, we will not obey any order to force... and what just... cops just got convicted under federal orders last month from, what, four or five years ago in New Orleans, shooting people trying to walk out on the highways.
[01:15:43.712 --> 01:15:44.112]  Remember that?
[01:15:44.332 --> 01:15:44.812]  Shooting them!
[01:15:45.172 --> 01:15:46.312]  Just mowing people down!
[01:15:47.253 --> 01:15:47.873]  Unarmed people!
[01:15:48.113 --> 01:15:52.714]  We will not obey any order to force American citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext.
[01:15:53.014 --> 01:15:56.915]  Number right, we will not obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on U.S.
[01:15:56.955 --> 01:16:02.015]  soil against the American people to keep the peace or to maintain control during an emergency or under any other pretext.
[01:16:02.376 --> 01:16:06.216]  As Henry Kissinger said, during stage crises they could bring in U.N.
[01:16:06.236 --> 01:16:06.556]  troops.
[01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:09.497]  We will consider any such use of foreign troops against the American people
[01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:12.190]  As an invasion and an act of war.
[01:16:12.230 --> 01:16:19.197]  Number nine, we will not obey any orders to confiscate the property of the American people, including food and other essential supplies, under any emergency pretext whatsoever.
[01:16:19.237 --> 01:16:27.544]  Number ten, we will not obey any orders which infringe upon the right of the people to free speech, to peaceably assemble, and to petition their government for redress of grievances.
[01:16:27.884 --> 01:16:29.005]  How is this treason?
[01:16:29.346 --> 01:16:31.928]  Anybody that violates this is involved in treason, Doctor.
[01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:36.272]  I keep wanting
[01:16:37.253 --> 01:16:47.344]  The oath keepers to add one more to that and that's to promise not to follow any order to participate in a war of aggression.
[01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:56.354]  But again, I mean you swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:16:58.567 --> 01:17:03.091]  I mean, reading that, reading the oath, it goes further than Oath Keepers.
[01:17:04.273 --> 01:17:08.477]  And I've read old army handbooks from 50 years ago that were more clear than this.
[01:17:08.917 --> 01:17:11.600]  But now this is treason to actually be a patriot.
[01:17:13.271 --> 01:17:16.194]  Yeah, they're trying to turn things all the way around.
[01:17:16.234 --> 01:17:18.876]  That's why I've called my organization the Patriots.
[01:17:19.436 --> 01:17:34.309]  We need to take that back, make it a good word again, and make people understand that we who are protecting the people of the United States are the Patriots, and those who are trying to subdue us are the traitors.
[01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:36.911]  Dr. Bob Bowman, stay there.
[01:17:36.931 --> 01:17:38.653]  We'll talk about more of what you're doing at
[01:17:40.165 --> 01:17:50.991]  Your website, your book, your materials, your newsletter on the other side, and we do have some people calling in now, Roger, Tom, and a lot of others.
[01:17:51.432 --> 01:17:57.795]  Folks, they are quietly training everywhere to take us on, and they're going to stage terror attacks to do it.
[01:17:58.035 --> 01:17:58.636]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:00.036 --> 01:18:03.899]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[01:18:03.939 --> 01:18:07.741]  My name is Span, and I'm 68 years old, and I live in Vermont.
[01:18:08.143 --> 01:18:12.605]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[01:18:12.865 --> 01:18:14.786]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[01:18:14.966 --> 01:18:16.267]  Made me feel breathless.
[01:18:16.667 --> 01:18:20.709]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[01:18:21.109 --> 01:18:22.129]  Nothing did anything.
[01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:26.151]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[01:18:26.171 --> 01:18:29.612]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[01:18:30.293 --> 01:18:32.934]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[01:18:33.382 --> 01:18:38.025]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month had completely vanished.

[01:18:59.745 --> 01:19:02.046]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:19:02.126 --> 01:19:04.327]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:19:04.447 --> 01:19:07.269]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:19:07.649 --> 01:19:12.411]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:19:12.771 --> 01:19:16.953]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:19:17.273 --> 01:19:19.594]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:19:19.614 --> 01:19:22.135]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:19:22.155 --> 01:19:25.056]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:19:25.417 --> 01:19:33.020]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:38.582]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:19:38.742 --> 01:19:41.542]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:19:41.602 --> 01:19:45.023]  So it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:19:45.283 --> 01:19:46.184]  And I got news for you.
[01:19:46.364 --> 01:19:47.644]  You're everyone else.
[01:19:47.684 --> 01:19:48.704]  Invisible Empire.

[01:21:02.697 --> 01:21:03.377]  Veterans!
[01:21:04.037 --> 01:21:07.818]  We have scores of secret and declassified and leaked government documents.
[01:21:07.838 --> 01:21:08.799]  We have new ones today.
[01:21:09.699 --> 01:21:13.400]  They are training against veterans.
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:16.061]  They are saying you're terrorists that are going to attack.
[01:21:16.841 --> 01:21:18.001]  This is outrageous.
[01:21:18.021 --> 01:21:19.821]  This is what the Soviets did when they took over.
[01:21:20.182 --> 01:21:20.982]  It's what Hitler did.
[01:21:21.002 --> 01:21:25.003]  He went and rounded up former military people that had been critical.
[01:21:25.808 --> 01:21:27.390]  I mean, this is happening in America.
[01:21:27.810 --> 01:21:29.192]  The banks have stolen trillions.
[01:21:29.532 --> 01:21:30.814]  They're setting up a police state.
[01:21:30.834 --> 01:21:32.716]  Your kids are hurt at their naked body scanners.
[01:21:33.136 --> 01:21:39.363]  School-issued laptops are watching kids 56,000 times at one school district and saying they're allowed to.
[01:21:39.783 --> 01:21:40.784]  I mean, this is hellish.
[01:21:40.804 --> 01:21:41.705]  And Dr. Bob Bowman...
[01:21:42.466 --> 01:21:44.467]  Yes Alex, I worked on a couple military bases 10 years ago, pre 9-11.
[01:21:44.487 --> 01:21:46.768]  They were a live round training base, combined arms tactical training.
[01:22:12.862 --> 01:22:17.586]  And basically what it was, 100 acre site, 60 buildings, replica of a U.S.
[01:22:17.606 --> 01:22:17.866]  city.
[01:22:18.306 --> 01:22:25.892]  Every building, like municipal hall, city hall, townhouse, residential housing, hotel.
[01:22:26.553 --> 01:22:27.854]  And it was basically the structures.
[01:22:28.294 --> 01:22:31.036]  And it was for ranger training for the Army to go through.
[01:22:31.056 --> 01:22:35.279]  At the time, you know, I wasn't really still watching TV and so on, not aware.
[01:22:35.299 --> 01:22:41.424]  And I was kind of taken aback because I expected to see a Middle Eastern, you know, like Middle Eastern town.
[01:22:42.159 --> 01:22:42.640]  I don't know.
[01:22:47.202 --> 01:22:53.826]  The context I dealt with told me it's because of the Oklahoma City that it was to deal with domestic troops.
[01:22:53.846 --> 01:23:02.832]  Yeah, we've got footage from three drills they did in the late 90s in Louisiana, where they admitted it was for the American people, and they had foreign troops drilling to do it.
[01:23:02.893 --> 01:23:06.755]  So they told you, ten years ago, this was for domestic groups.
[01:23:07.556 --> 01:23:12.319]  Exactly, and they cited Oklahoma as one.
[01:23:12.619 --> 01:23:16.261]  Now, was this drilling for the U.S., and was this with U.S.
[01:23:16.281 --> 01:23:16.582]  troops?
[01:23:17.302 --> 01:23:20.525]  Yeah, it was a Rangers base in the northwest.
[01:23:20.605 --> 01:23:21.686]  There was one in Alaska.
[01:23:22.166 --> 01:23:24.048]  I think a couple in the southern states as well.
[01:23:24.068 --> 01:23:25.770]  There was about six or so at the time.
[01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:28.972]  Well, last year I had an Army colonel on who was in the newspaper.
[01:23:28.993 --> 01:23:30.954]  We're doing door-to-door gun confiscation drills.
[01:23:31.995 --> 01:23:34.057]  And then I had the colonel on and he admitted it.
[01:23:34.097 --> 01:23:37.340]  That's in Police State, The Rise of FEMA, the new film.
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:38.541]  I appreciate your call.
[01:23:38.561 --> 01:23:43.906]  Dr. Bob Bowman, this has been going on a long time, but I see it really accelerating and coming to a head.
[01:23:45.182 --> 01:23:46.363]  Yeah, right on.
[01:23:46.623 --> 01:23:48.324]  Let's get another one of your callers.
[01:23:48.444 --> 01:23:52.586]  All right, let's talk to Roger in Missouri, former military, about drills.
[01:23:52.626 --> 01:23:53.027]  Go ahead.
[01:23:54.607 --> 01:23:57.609]  Yes, this has been going on for a long, long time.
[01:23:59.070 --> 01:24:07.295]  Memorial Day of 1973, I was stationed at Camp Pelham in California, and the Black Panthers was going to march on Camp Pelham.
[01:24:09.476 --> 01:24:14.379]  The commandant general actually came out, secured liberty for everybody on the base,
[01:24:15.425 --> 01:24:43.139]  uh... bought recon out put thirty cal machine guns out and they drew a line and they told the black panthers you go across that line we're going to kill you then after that uh... they started they uh... transformed the vietnam training village into what would look like uh... just a regular united states street and uh... told us that uh... of course that was during the Nixon administration when they was
[01:24:44.231 --> 01:24:50.455]  Uh, Watergate was going on that we would probably be attacked by, uh, armed citizens.
[01:24:52.216 --> 01:25:11.029]  Uh, also, uh, just four years ago, uh, I belong to the Marine Corps League and the local police and sheriff's department came and asked us if we'd get SERT trained, uh, to help out in administrative duties and, and, uh, uh, rescue during, uh,

[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:14.901]  They get you there for one reason, then bait and switch.
[01:25:14.921 --> 01:25:15.341]  Stay with us.

[01:27:07.624 --> 01:27:09.646]  Dr. Bob Bowman with us in the final segment.
[01:27:10.407 --> 01:27:12.769]  Air Force Colonel, former head of the Star Wars program.
[01:27:12.789 --> 01:27:17.674]  He's been warning about the military being trained to engage in martial law operations.
[01:27:17.694 --> 01:27:24.100]  We have more secret Army documents confirmed by major newspapers to be authentic, leaked by patriots.
[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:24.800]  U.S.
[01:27:24.901 --> 01:27:28.144]  Army trains to confront Tea Party terrorists.
[01:27:28.644 --> 01:27:35.742]  Military personnel blow the whistle on exercise which involved troops taking protesters to concentration camps.
[01:27:36.721 --> 01:27:38.781]  This is the updated, beefed article.
[01:27:38.921 --> 01:27:40.322]  Paul Watson, Kurt Nemo.
[01:27:40.382 --> 01:27:43.282]  Kurt Nemo, of course, broke this at InfoWars.com.
[01:27:44.323 --> 01:27:45.223]  And it continues.
[01:27:45.263 --> 01:27:47.123]  Kurt Nemo, Paul, Joseph Watson.
[01:27:47.403 --> 01:27:49.824]  The key article is at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:27:50.104 --> 01:27:51.884]  This just went up minutes ago.
[01:27:52.204 --> 01:27:53.905]  It's got all the documents you need.
[01:27:54.605 --> 01:27:58.306]  We've got other news coming up in the last half hour on population reduction.
[01:28:00.046 --> 01:28:01.926]  So we'll be discussing that.
[01:28:02.526 --> 01:28:04.647]  We're about to go back to the caller.
[01:28:05.507 --> 01:28:13.752]  And even after Dr. Bob Bowman leaves us, I will continue with military veterans and others who've been through these drills to take on the American people.
[01:28:13.772 --> 01:28:22.677]  We're going back to Roger here in a moment, but Dr. Bowman, before we run out of time, people can get your newsletter, they can learn more at your website.
[01:28:22.697 --> 01:28:24.798]  You also have a book out that's very informative.
[01:28:24.818 --> 01:28:25.459]  Tell us about that.
[01:28:28.422 --> 01:28:28.762]  Thank you.
[01:28:46.324 --> 01:28:49.726]  You can do that through our website, through PayPal, or mail us a check.
[01:28:50.166 --> 01:28:57.489]  And make sure you include your email address so that we can email you a copy of the book.
[01:28:58.350 --> 01:29:01.451]  And so you won't need to wait until we find a publisher.
[01:29:01.911 --> 01:29:03.292]  And give folks the title again.
[01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:07.623]  A populist vision for America.
[01:29:08.324 --> 01:29:08.805]  Absolutely.
[01:29:08.825 --> 01:29:21.618]  And in there are not only the problems that we face but the proposals we have for solving those problems and what we can do to take our country back.
[01:29:21.738 --> 01:29:23.440]  And give folks the website one more time.
[01:29:24.502 --> 01:29:27.184]  ThePatriots.us.
[01:29:27.484 --> 01:29:31.386]  Patriots with an S. We don't stand together, we all hang separate.
[01:29:31.426 --> 01:29:47.956]  Now, for those that just joined us, Roger was talking about decades ago doing drills to take on the American people, and then he was part of the Marine Corps League, and I've seen this in the news, in major papers the last two months, we've got to add that, where they are training former veterans to take on
[01:29:48.456 --> 01:29:51.677]  Yeah, I was saying we went to a regional airport for a terrorist drill.
[01:30:19.003 --> 01:30:27.970]  And after we got right in the middle of it, they announced that these terrorists were militia, American militia.
[01:30:28.851 --> 01:30:34.316]  And soon after that, me and a few other guys resigned from the Marine Corps League.
[01:30:35.036 --> 01:30:38.759]  And I've also been blacklisted from the Marine Corps League and the VFW.
[01:30:38.859 --> 01:30:48.367]  And I find, and I'm sorry to say this, but the World War II guys, the Korean veterans and the early Vietnam veterans,
[01:30:49.136 --> 01:30:53.939]  are so brainwashed that you cannot reason with them.
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:57.162]  They cannot believe that their country would do things to them.
[01:30:58.062 --> 01:31:03.086]  And I try to reach out to them, but there's just really... I'll tell you what, Roger.
[01:31:03.146 --> 01:31:03.506]  Stay there.
[01:31:03.526 --> 01:31:05.047]  We're going to let Dr. Bob Bowman go.
[01:31:05.067 --> 01:31:06.168]  We appreciate him being gracious.
[01:31:06.448 --> 01:31:14.674]  I'm going to come back, and I want you to explain this, because it's on record for decades, but now it's accelerating that they're training the military to take the American people on.
[01:31:16.115 --> 01:31:20.561]  I want to discuss this and go to more veterans and more military people that are calling in right now.
[01:31:20.621 --> 01:31:30.135]  Dr. Bob Bowman, I wanted to get you on also about the secret space plane blast-off and what you think was going on there, but we'll talk to you again in the near future.
[01:31:30.175 --> 01:31:33.019]  We've been so honored to have you spend this time with us today, sir.
[01:31:34.264 --> 01:31:36.665]  Well, thank you, and keep at it, Alex.
[01:31:37.185 --> 01:31:37.665]  We'll try.
[01:31:37.685 --> 01:31:39.606]  I was going to get another subject, so I'm sorry this broke.
[01:31:39.666 --> 01:31:44.568]  We've got to warn the people, but we couldn't have a better guest than you here, because you've been warning about this so intensely.
[01:31:44.588 --> 01:31:45.408]  Thank you, Dr. Bob Bowman.
[01:31:45.708 --> 01:31:53.131]  Roger, Tom, Brian, Chad, Carl, we're going to go to you after this break.
[01:31:53.211 --> 01:31:56.352]  Former military, current military, police have been part of these drills.
[01:31:56.633 --> 01:31:57.553]  Your call straight ahead.
[01:32:00.302 --> 01:32:02.905]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:03.326 --> 01:32:08.292]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:08.652 --> 01:32:10.375]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:10.695 --> 01:32:15.521]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:15.701 --> 01:32:16.663]  How much do you want?
[01:32:16.883 --> 01:32:17.624]  When do you want it?
[01:32:18.004 --> 01:32:19.585]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:19.886 --> 01:32:20.706]  When will you need it?
[01:32:20.947 --> 01:32:23.028]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:23.148 --> 01:32:24.249]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:24.490 --> 01:32:25.831]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:26.031 --> 01:32:31.095]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:31.295 --> 01:32:34.418]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:34.858 --> 01:32:38.381]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:38.681 --> 01:32:39.662]  How much will you need?
[01:32:39.923 --> 01:32:40.523]  We don't know.
[01:32:40.823 --> 01:32:41.724]  How much do you want?
[01:32:41.924 --> 01:32:42.665]  All you can get.
[01:32:42.845 --> 01:32:43.706]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:43.946 --> 01:32:46.708]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:47.009 --> 01:32:48.750]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:49.691]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:59.414 --> 01:33:00.674]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:33:00.714 --> 01:33:06.056]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:33:06.316 --> 01:33:10.938]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:33:11.318 --> 01:33:11.718]  It's true.
[01:33:11.798 --> 01:33:16.360]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:21.603]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:33:22.124 --> 01:33:24.045]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:33:24.425 --> 01:33:29.048]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:33:29.228 --> 01:33:30.129]  And here's the best part.
[01:33:30.349 --> 01:33:33.131]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:33:33.411 --> 01:33:36.733]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:33:37.054 --> 01:33:39.875]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:33:40.236 --> 01:33:42.117]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:33:42.457 --> 01:33:43.378]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:48.802]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:33:51.244 --> 01:33:55.769]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:33:56.089 --> 01:33:58.472]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseabank.com.
[01:34:00.953 --> 01:34:04.574]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:34:04.914 --> 01:34:13.035]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:34:13.775 --> 01:34:17.796]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:34:18.396 --> 01:34:29.218]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:34:29.838 --> 01:34:38.840]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:34:39.361 --> 01:34:44.422]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:34:44.782 --> 01:34:51.964]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:34:52.264 --> 01:34:55.025]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:35:01.275 --> 01:35:03.479]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:06.845]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:09.211 --> 01:35:14.034]  All over the country, for decades, I've interviewed Marine Corps captains.
[01:35:14.054 --> 01:35:16.296]  I've interviewed generals.
[01:35:16.516 --> 01:35:21.019]  I've talked to high-level former and current Pentagon people many, many times.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:38.611]  Federal marshals, state police gave us the MIAC Homeland Security documents over a year ago, saying the number one threat, the government says, is gun owners, returning veterans, conservatives, people that have American flags on their cars, and that we're going to attack law enforcement, military, and IRS buildings.
[01:35:39.311 --> 01:35:43.773]  Then they bust a few militias that they set up to create the illusion that it's all about to happen.
[01:35:44.053 --> 01:35:50.755]  Bill Clinton comes out and says, gee, I hope the Tea Party shut up or it's going to cause somebody to blow up a federal building again.
[01:35:51.155 --> 01:35:58.918]  And we then have all the eyewitnesses and people that were at the Alfred P. Murrow building with McVeigh and feds in there planting gray sticks of butter and they didn't know what it was.
[01:35:58.938 --> 01:36:01.979]  I mean, this is, I've interviewed the foreman of the grand jury!
[01:36:02.839 --> 01:36:03.740]  Hoppy Heidelberg!
[01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:06.944]  The FBI came to his house with guns and said, shut up!
[01:36:07.544 --> 01:36:08.666]  Stop talking about it!
[01:36:09.086 --> 01:36:13.231]  They killed Cop of the Year, who was a witness, and saved a bunch of people because he saw it.
[01:36:13.992 --> 01:36:16.054]  I mean, they're not playing games here.
[01:36:16.775 --> 01:36:18.216]  This is not a radio show.
[01:36:18.256 --> 01:36:19.277]  It's not entertainment.
[01:36:19.297 --> 01:36:21.300]  It's not Alex Jones having fun.
[01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:22.281]  I'm exhausted.
[01:36:22.721 --> 01:36:23.702]  All I think about is...
[01:36:24.693 --> 01:36:28.297]  Spending time with my family, but I was going to go home today and take my kids to the park.
[01:36:28.677 --> 01:36:29.538]  I'm not even doing that now.
[01:36:29.558 --> 01:36:33.082]  I'm going to stay here and put out an emergency video trying to warn people.
[01:36:35.967 --> 01:36:37.709]  We've got criminal offshore banks.
[01:36:37.849 --> 01:36:39.410]  I played the CFR speech.
[01:36:39.931 --> 01:36:43.394]  The head of the European Central Bank saying, we have worked for world government.
[01:36:43.654 --> 01:36:45.015]  We are now establishing it.
[01:36:45.335 --> 01:36:47.377]  The taxes will be paid directly to the banks.
[01:36:47.797 --> 01:36:48.658]  Ha ha ha!
[01:36:49.278 --> 01:36:50.119]  World government!
[01:36:50.399 --> 01:36:56.284]  Then I had Nightline here two days ago laughing at me when I was playing them world government clips.
[01:36:57.185 --> 01:36:58.506]  Saying, well that's not what they mean.
[01:36:59.787 --> 01:37:02.970]  They've stole 28 trill plus in the last year and a half.
[01:37:03.570 --> 01:37:05.071]  They're taking over everything.
[01:37:05.492 --> 01:37:08.374]  They're openly in the news saying they're going to take your pension funds.
[01:37:08.394 --> 01:37:11.196]  Alright, I'm going to try to shut up.
[01:37:11.757 --> 01:37:16.181]  And I'm going to try to go to these veterans and police and others that are on hold here.
[01:37:17.603 --> 01:37:19.946]  Uh, and we've got an active duty folks, Chris.
[01:37:19.966 --> 01:37:22.068]  I'm gonna try to get to everybody, but it's so touching.
[01:37:23.169 --> 01:37:26.032]  Uh, and I've got so many of these callers now, I can't even keep track of them.
[01:37:26.052 --> 01:37:27.373]  Who's the caller I've been talking to?
[01:37:27.393 --> 01:37:30.076]  Um, yeah, yeah, Roger.
[01:37:30.096 --> 01:37:32.939]  And everything Roger's saying, I've actually seen in separate documents.
[01:37:33.923 --> 01:37:43.086]  REX84 training to use the military, FEMA camps, the Emergency Centers Act, the Top Off II drills, NLE09, NLEO10.
[01:37:43.106 --> 01:37:52.290]  I mean, the military sent it to us and to others last year that at in the Fed rallies with Ron Paul and others,
[01:37:53.405 --> 01:37:56.267]  Myself, it specifically mentioned Texas and Dallas.
[01:37:56.388 --> 01:37:58.169]  When I was there, you see it in the Obama Deception.
[01:37:58.449 --> 01:38:01.832]  Bullhorning the Federal Reserve, talking about how they're a banking dictatorship.
[01:38:02.372 --> 01:38:06.075]  Army, regular army was there, and they said, don't let them know you're army.
[01:38:06.876 --> 01:38:08.958]  They may be terrorists and may kill you.
[01:38:08.978 --> 01:38:11.059]  They teach the military.
[01:38:11.079 --> 01:38:16.904]  And there's all these great Americans of all races, you know, religions out there calling for sovereignty.
[01:38:17.164 --> 01:38:18.465]  And there was army there.
[01:38:19.346 --> 01:38:25.308]  And being told that we would kill them, or may kill them, if they told us they were military.
[01:38:25.928 --> 01:38:28.689]  Now folks, that is brainwashing.
[01:38:28.789 --> 01:38:37.231]  And when you read these documents, and the latest, this comes out of the Carrier Journal, this comes out of Carrier Journal, Louisville, Kentucky.
[01:38:38.601 --> 01:38:41.082]  And then we've got it at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:38:41.102 --> 01:38:42.143]  They just report it dryly.
[01:38:42.183 --> 01:38:47.726]  It's like that Ithaca newspaper in New York talking about martial law.
[01:38:48.206 --> 01:38:57.392]  You've got in Illinois, you've got in California, you've got in New York State the last three months, from Schenectady to you name it.
[01:38:57.412 --> 01:38:58.492]  In fact, that was in the news.
[01:38:58.552 --> 01:38:59.353]  Here it is right here!
[01:38:59.853 --> 01:39:01.715]  Here it is right here, Chicago Tribune.
[01:39:02.696 --> 01:39:05.378]  Two Chicago state reps, they bring in National Guard.
[01:39:05.598 --> 01:39:12.164]  Blagojevich, a year ago, before he got disgraced, said we're going to use National Guard for gun confiscation door-to-door.
[01:39:12.224 --> 01:39:13.566]  I played his press conference!
[01:39:14.006 --> 01:39:15.067]  I mean, look at New Orleans.
[01:39:15.107 --> 01:39:17.770]  They went in the high and dry areas and took everybody's guns!
[01:39:18.330 --> 01:39:20.092]  And the people are still in denial about that!
[01:39:21.900 --> 01:39:34.623]  I mean, folks, do you understand that they are trying to warp the brains of the troops, they're telling them that the American conservatives and libertarians are going to kill them, and they're going to stage events to make that a real occurrence, so they can use them against us.
[01:39:34.983 --> 01:39:46.426]  And we were talking to Roger, and then I'm going to everybody else, and Roger, if you just joined us, was talking about, he tried to, he was in the Marine Corps League, they took him out to an airport, and I've been at airport drills in Brooksville, Florida.
[01:39:46.966 --> 01:39:51.812]  They had feds jumping out of the bushes trying to light things on fire and blaming on me.
[01:39:53.414 --> 01:39:58.401]  We've got video of me in the neighborhood where they were doing military drills and women coming out saying, are you Alex Jones?
[01:39:58.701 --> 01:40:02.646]  I was told not to talk to you by the army, by special forces!
[01:40:03.527 --> 01:40:11.671]  And Special Forces guys in plain clothes, you heard Mike Hanson on air with us, just jumping out of the bushes at night, lighting fires, and I'm like running over, stopping him.
[01:40:11.731 --> 01:40:12.092]  No!
[01:40:12.432 --> 01:40:12.672]  No!
[01:40:12.732 --> 01:40:13.532]  Don't blame me!
[01:40:13.552 --> 01:40:16.714]  I mean, this is what I live, this is what I do.
[01:40:17.034 --> 01:40:19.536]  Folks, I've had Special Forces in plain clothes.
[01:40:20.296 --> 01:40:21.618]  In a Target parking lot.
[01:40:21.858 --> 01:40:25.783]  Tell me they're special forces and they're gonna get me if I don't shut up years ago.
[01:40:26.183 --> 01:40:31.410]  I've had guys pound on me, attack me in a parking lot, telling me shut up as they were breaking my nose.
[01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:34.433]  I have been there, ladies and gentlemen, I'm telling you.
[01:40:34.613 --> 01:40:39.059]  They're ready to go after the American people and their number one target in these new documents...
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:41.501]  Is veterans!
[01:40:41.541 --> 01:40:44.264]  Don't you understand how treasonous this is?
[01:40:44.544 --> 01:40:49.108]  Because veterans are good people, police are good people on average, and they understand.
[01:40:49.328 --> 01:40:55.354]  And they saw the feds demonize us patriots and call us kooks for talking about a new world order for decades.
[01:40:55.554 --> 01:40:57.776]  And now they've seen it all come true, and they're waking up.
[01:40:57.796 --> 01:40:59.238]  Okay, okay, I'm gonna shut up.
[01:40:59.818 --> 01:41:01.378]  It's just, it's just, this is so real.
[01:41:01.418 --> 01:41:02.438]  This doesn't have to happen.
[01:41:03.159 --> 01:41:05.259]  The country doesn't have to fall to tyranny.
[01:41:05.859 --> 01:41:15.841]  Finish up what you were saying, Roger, in Missouri, about just a few years ago, they get the Marine Corps League out to aid the military at a base, and they say, we're not fighting foreign terrorists, we're getting ready for militia.
[01:41:15.861 --> 01:41:16.241]  Go ahead.
[01:41:17.061 --> 01:41:28.643]  Yes, like I said, me and a few others eventually resigned over things like that, but there's one good thing, Alex, especially our governor, Jay Nixon, here in Missouri,
[01:41:29.284 --> 01:41:35.109]  Probably woke more veterans up than any of us could by putting out that Mike report.
[01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:52.924]  Seriously, I don't think he'll get reelected because four years ago, people just like you, they called me a nut and they don't do it very loudly, but I've had many of them come to me and say, you was right.
[01:41:53.344 --> 01:41:53.905]  You was right.
[01:41:54.884 --> 01:41:56.325]  So we're winning.
[01:41:57.386 --> 01:41:58.727]  Yeah, we're winning.
[01:41:58.767 --> 01:42:02.691]  That's why Clinton's up there with veiled threats about blowing stuff up to blame it on us.
[01:42:04.812 --> 01:42:05.853]  But they're showing their hand.
[01:42:07.094 --> 01:42:08.275]  Well, you know what?
[01:42:08.335 --> 01:42:13.620]  All these vets out there, they need to understand that the government is going to come for the guns.
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:19.704]  And they better understand our country's been taken over by foreign banks, and that's why this is not our government.
[01:42:19.964 --> 01:42:23.747]  These guys out there that say this can't happen here, it is happening here.
[01:42:24.248 --> 01:42:25.709]  It is, and it's accelerating.
[01:42:25.749 --> 01:42:27.290]  God bless you, I appreciate your call, Roger.
[01:42:27.871 --> 01:42:34.616]  Okay, there's a lot of military calls here, and I'm going to go to Brian, Carl, Chris,
[01:42:36.874 --> 01:42:37.915]  Just a bunch of other people.
[01:42:38.435 --> 01:42:40.737]  But Chris is in Tennessee, active military.
[01:42:41.018 --> 01:42:41.918]  This is in Police State 4.
[01:42:42.139 --> 01:42:43.160]  We interviewed the state rep.
[01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:44.381]  Remember last year?
[01:42:45.181 --> 01:42:50.266]  There were suddenly regular army with Marine Corps checkpoints with Homeland Security shutting down highways.
[01:42:50.486 --> 01:42:52.788]  And the governor said don't do it and they still did it.
[01:42:53.829 --> 01:42:55.831]  And it was on the local news.
[01:42:56.331 --> 01:42:57.832]  So maybe he's going to call in about that.
[01:42:59.334 --> 01:43:01.836]  Let's go ahead and go to Chris in Tennessee, active duty.
[01:43:01.876 --> 01:43:02.737]  Chris, what can you tell us?
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:06.783]  Hi Alex, I've been a listener for about five years.
[01:43:06.803 --> 01:43:09.306]  I'm also part of Vote Keepers and we are changing Memphis.
[01:43:09.426 --> 01:43:16.873]  I was actually stationed in Florida when that happened and I personally haven't participated in any of those types of shows.
[01:43:16.893 --> 01:43:18.835]  Wait a minute, you were in Florida when I was there?
[01:43:18.855 --> 01:43:23.440]  I was in Florida, I was stationed in Florida when they did the
[01:43:24.048 --> 01:43:25.109]  My brother is also in the Army.
[01:43:25.129 --> 01:43:26.930]  He's part of the 3rd Brigade in Fort Stewart, Georgia.
[01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:28.932]  He's not part of the 1st Infantry, but the 1st Infantry.
[01:43:44.602 --> 01:43:50.365]  Is it the unit that is deployed in the United States for, you know, the civil unrest?
[01:43:50.405 --> 01:43:52.506]  Yeah, that's the first cohort.
[01:43:52.847 --> 01:44:04.273]  First Spear Centurion group is basically what it is that forms the heart of the 400,000 group that they're building, according to Army Times, to occupy the U.S.
[01:44:05.133 --> 01:44:05.393]  Right.
[01:44:05.954 --> 01:44:13.978]  And last time I visited him, I talked to, I actually posted this story on the Prison Planet forums, but I talked to some of his neighbors and stuff on the base.
[01:44:14.625 --> 01:44:27.747]  that are part of the first infantry and they confirmed that they are indeed trained in implementing martial law and one of the guys, actually his neighbor was telling me he flies the UAVs for the surveillance ones
[01:44:28.494 --> 01:44:32.817]  And he says he spies on civilians on a daily basis, just randomly.
[01:44:33.157 --> 01:44:43.022]  Sir, I had a Marine Corps source come to AXS TV in 99, two weeks after I was at Urban Warrior with the Marines landing and taking over a part of Oakland.
[01:44:43.342 --> 01:44:46.944]  And I had him come and say, you can see this, but you can't have it.
[01:44:47.405 --> 01:44:51.707]  And it was UAVs watching us flying around.
[01:44:51.727 --> 01:44:55.049]  We were getting out of the hotel, getting out of our car, going Death Star 1, Death Star 1.
[01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:56.870]  We've got the militia terrorists in our sights.
[01:44:57.650 --> 01:45:01.492]  And again, I wasn't allowed to show the public that because then it would have gone back to whoever supposedly did it.
[01:45:01.732 --> 01:45:03.213]  But I'm sorry, just go ahead.
[01:45:04.414 --> 01:45:05.334]  It's not surprising.
[01:45:05.674 --> 01:45:08.916]  I did want to say there are a lot of people in the military that are waking up.
[01:45:09.696 --> 01:45:15.700]  Where I'm stationed, the officers, my bosses, they're not completely awake, but they're getting there.
[01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:20.102]  I've woke up a lot of people in the military, and I think they're going to have a hard time
[01:45:20.991 --> 01:45:39.438]  uh... implementing martial law short of bringing in foreign troops but uh... let me go back here let's not just glaze over this and i may hold you over again uh... active duty uh... here now in tennessee chris let's be clear under the john warren defense authorization act uh... under
[01:45:40.905 --> 01:45:42.525]  What Brigade Homeland has announced.
[01:45:42.585 --> 01:45:45.326]  I mean, you're not telling us anything that is secret.
[01:45:45.346 --> 01:45:46.246]  This is on record.
[01:45:46.546 --> 01:45:51.768]  But you're saying even the guys know that they are training for martial law in America.
[01:45:52.428 --> 01:45:57.169]  Yeah, I asked them, like, have you received any training on martial law or anything like that?
[01:45:57.609 --> 01:45:59.069]  They're like, yeah.
[01:45:59.209 --> 01:46:03.170]  Like, a big problem that I see, Alex, is that a lot of these people are really dumb.
[01:46:03.230 --> 01:46:06.131]  Like, if you go to the base where my brother is,
[01:46:07.296 --> 01:46:15.280]  It's like a fancy trailer park, basically, with everybody running around with IQs like Forrest Gump and 10 kids running around and everything.
[01:46:15.861 --> 01:46:17.101]  And that's where the problem is.
[01:46:17.141 --> 01:46:22.324]  That's where the Nazis are in the military, is just ignorance, you know?
[01:46:22.824 --> 01:46:31.049]  Like, the smart people in the military are really coming around and waking up, especially since Obama got elected, but there's just still a lot of stupid people in the military.
[01:46:34.099 --> 01:46:36.960]  And so he's like, yeah, we're trained in martial law.
[01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:38.601]  I watch Citizens every day.
[01:46:38.641 --> 01:46:43.463]  Yeah, well, I don't even think he really understood what it, what it means.
[01:46:43.543 --> 01:46:47.424]  You know, the guy that I talked to, he did say, yeah, we've got trained on martial law.
[01:46:47.784 --> 01:46:50.125]  But I mean, he didn't understand what that meant.
[01:46:50.145 --> 01:46:54.007]  I tried to explain it to him, but you could tell it went way over his head and everything.
[01:46:54.087 --> 01:46:54.427]  Stay there.
[01:46:54.447 --> 01:46:55.727]  I got a few other questions for you.
[01:46:55.787 --> 01:46:59.849]  And then other military vets, current people, active duty, it's all coming up.
[01:46:59.869 --> 01:47:00.289]  Stay with us.
[01:47:02.611 --> 01:47:04.292]  You're subject to public police action.
[01:47:05.053 --> 01:47:05.974]  Tyranny is here.
[01:47:06.314 --> 01:47:10.017]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:47:10.178 --> 01:47:12.459]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:47:12.479 --> 01:47:17.924]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:47:18.345 --> 01:47:24.570]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:47:25.010 --> 01:47:30.553]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:47:30.953 --> 01:47:34.655]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:47:35.156 --> 01:47:39.218]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:47:39.438 --> 01:47:45.001]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:47:45.401 --> 01:47:48.283]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:47:48.943 --> 01:47:50.365]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:47:50.906 --> 01:47:51.366]  It's here.

[01:49:01.568 --> 01:49:02.629]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:49:03.029 --> 01:49:08.491]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:49:09.072 --> 01:49:09.572]  That's right.
[01:49:09.892 --> 01:49:12.173]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:49:12.733 --> 01:49:19.657]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:49:20.217 --> 01:49:27.899]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:49:28.359 --> 01:49:33.200]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:39.241]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:49:39.641 --> 01:49:43.762]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:49:44.162 --> 01:49:44.402]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:49:47.003 --> 01:49:49.187]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:49:49.487 --> 01:49:49.767]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:49:49.788 --> 01:49:49.988]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:49:59.778 --> 01:50:01.660]  Hi, this is Steve Shank, eFoodsDirect.
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:07.146]  We have stopped taking orders for the Buy 3 Get 1 Free program and have started production.
[01:50:07.327 --> 01:50:08.368]  Congratulations!
[01:50:08.648 --> 01:50:14.735]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food supply by pre-ordering will prove very wise.
[01:50:15.115 --> 01:50:19.861]  Shipments will begin the end of March and will be sent in the order that they were received.
[01:50:20.161 --> 01:50:20.862]  Now something fun!
[01:50:21.262 --> 01:50:22.063]  It's springtime.
[01:50:22.223 --> 01:50:29.928]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.889]  Here's the plan.
[01:50:31.029 --> 01:50:39.615]  When you add a one-month Superfood Spring Pack to your food storage, we'll send you that garden of non-hybrid seeds absolutely free.
[01:50:39.956 --> 01:50:41.837]  Order now while the free seeds last.
[01:50:42.277 --> 01:50:42.518]  Call 800-409-5662.
[01:50:49.909 --> 01:50:50.109]  We're good.
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:31.361]  I was just reading the beefed up article.
[01:51:31.381 --> 01:51:33.221]  He's adding more documentation as we go.
[01:51:33.881 --> 01:51:36.722]  By Paul Joseph Watson and Curt Nemo at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:51:36.822 --> 01:51:37.082]  U.S.
[01:51:38.162 --> 01:51:41.383]  Army trains to take on two parties and take them to concentration camps.
[01:51:41.403 --> 01:51:42.263]  That's in the documents.
[01:51:44.523 --> 01:51:51.925]  For decades they've been training to take us on quietly with small cadres, building it into bigger forces, slow brainwashing, incremental.
[01:51:52.325 --> 01:51:53.145]  Now they're deploying
[01:51:54.162 --> 01:51:55.223]  Army at checkpoints.
[01:51:55.624 --> 01:51:59.427]  Marines at checkpoints in the middle of the nation to stop drunk drivers.
[01:51:59.907 --> 01:52:03.411]  They're preparing everyone to go against the American people.
[01:52:03.511 --> 01:52:07.635]  The American people, even peacefully, try to say, no, we're not going into a new world order.
[01:52:08.683 --> 01:52:09.464]  This is the time.
[01:52:09.644 --> 01:52:10.624]  It's coming down to it.
[01:52:11.325 --> 01:52:19.470]  Now, I want to now hurry through the calls, finishing up with Chris, active duty, talking to the folks at Brigade Homeland, going, yeah, we're training for martial law.
[01:52:19.810 --> 01:52:21.411]  Yeah, we're surveilling the American people.
[01:52:22.652 --> 01:52:32.479]  I mean, I've talked to family who are officers in the military, and they say even repair units that fix helicopters and things are, for the first time ever, being trained in riot control and martial law.
[01:52:34.949 --> 01:52:40.092]  The military needs to read the actual officer-level manuals because they're training to take on veterans.
[01:52:40.512 --> 01:52:43.554]  I mean, is this disgusting, people in the military that you talk to?
[01:52:43.934 --> 01:52:49.398]  Don't they understand that they're going to be out of the military soon and that every dictatorship goes after the veterans first?
[01:52:50.885 --> 01:52:51.766]  It's disgusting.
[01:52:51.866 --> 01:52:56.289]  Some people, once they realize it, a lot of people don't even realize the extent that it's going on.
[01:52:56.989 --> 01:53:00.331]  And when I point it out to them, a lot of times it will disgust them.
[01:53:00.371 --> 01:53:03.614]  But still, a lot of people are afraid to do anything about it.
[01:53:03.654 --> 01:53:10.218]  Nobody wants to stand up and talk about it or even join Oath Keepers for the most part, with the exception of a few people that I've met.
[01:53:12.035 --> 01:53:22.367]  I just want to encourage everybody, all the brothers and sisters in the military, to not be afraid to talk to people and you'd be surprised how many people you find that actually agree with you.
[01:53:23.048 --> 01:53:28.774]  And just uphold your oath to the Constitution no matter what, you know, because that's why you joined the military, I think.
[01:53:29.075 --> 01:53:29.275]  Yep.
[01:53:29.535 --> 01:53:31.417]  God bless you and I appreciate your call, Chris.
[01:53:33.055 --> 01:53:43.161]  The Feds, under FBI command, said, don't let people walk out on the bridges, make them stay, don't give them food and water, go into the rich areas that weren't affected, that were high, on high ground, take their guns.
[01:53:44.141 --> 01:53:45.242]  All the arms will be taken.
[01:53:45.262 --> 01:53:46.463]  No one will be allowed to be armed.
[01:53:46.663 --> 01:53:47.783]  That's the quote of the police chief.
[01:53:48.444 --> 01:53:49.824]  And the military did what they were told.
[01:53:51.085 --> 01:53:52.206]  And a lot of U.S.
[01:53:52.246 --> 01:53:53.086]  citizens were killed.
[01:53:53.787 --> 01:53:56.988]  And they went into old ladies' houses that wanted to stay there and take care of their dogs and cats.
[01:53:57.028 --> 01:53:59.150]  And they took their guns and drug them off to jail.
[01:54:00.069 --> 01:54:05.952]  I mean, this is America, and they passed the test, and the new order said, good, you'll do it, we're getting ready for it.
[01:54:06.372 --> 01:54:08.793]  And it is going to happen if we don't scream bloody murder.
[01:54:09.253 --> 01:54:12.175]  Let's talk to Roger, and then Carl, Mike, and others.
[01:54:13.475 --> 01:54:17.897]  Mike says his uncles in the military has key info, but let's talk to Roger, former military.
[01:54:17.957 --> 01:54:19.178]  Roger, what's your take on this?
[01:54:20.218 --> 01:54:22.760]  Once we talk to Roger, let's talk to Carl in Texas.
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:23.320]  Go ahead, Carl.
[01:54:24.483 --> 01:54:25.464]  Hey, buddy.
[01:54:25.524 --> 01:54:26.365]  How you doing there, man?
[01:54:26.605 --> 01:54:27.365]  I'm just sick of it.
[01:54:27.386 --> 01:54:28.627]  I wish this nightmare would stop.
[01:54:28.667 --> 01:54:30.908]  I wish people would wake up and say no.
[01:54:32.049 --> 01:54:32.930]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[01:54:33.731 --> 01:54:35.392]  I'm in an interracial relationship.
[01:54:35.432 --> 01:54:36.413]  My wife's African-American.
[01:54:36.873 --> 01:54:39.335]  I'm white, if you want to call it that, Hispanic.
[01:54:40.376 --> 01:54:53.327]  I just wanted to say thanks to Dr. Bowman for what he's done with his group so far to make a point of support of the diversity that I'm personally seeing more and more of on his website and YouTube account through the videos that he's shown
[01:54:53.891 --> 01:54:54.351]  We're good to go.
[01:55:11.004 --> 01:55:12.365]  For a certain race of people.
[01:55:12.765 --> 01:55:15.607]  And Oath Keepers is meant for all Americans of all races.
[01:55:15.687 --> 01:55:17.488]  And that's really what I was just calling for.
[01:55:18.368 --> 01:55:19.589]  I just wanted to make that point.
[01:55:19.609 --> 01:55:20.909]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:55:21.850 --> 01:55:22.790]  Because here's the issue.
[01:55:22.931 --> 01:55:25.492]  The media is saying the Oath Keepers are treasonous.
[01:55:26.192 --> 01:55:29.014]  They're saying anybody who doesn't want a banking takeover is racist.
[01:55:29.174 --> 01:55:34.257]  They are injecting race into the debate to get us at each other's throats.
[01:55:34.297 --> 01:55:34.917]  God bless you.
[01:55:34.997 --> 01:55:36.218]  I really appreciate that call.
[01:55:36.818 --> 01:55:37.318]  Let's go to
[01:55:38.599 --> 01:55:39.440]  Another call here.
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:41.681]  Let's talk to Mike in Illinois.
[01:55:41.722 --> 01:55:42.482]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:55:42.502 --> 01:55:44.684]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:55:45.064 --> 01:56:05.239]  You know, uh, speaking of race, uh, Barry Serto, Serto, wherever his name is, he, when he was at my local in Bloomington Normal, he sounded much more African American Black, you know, uh, and that was when he was running for Senator.
[01:56:05.259 --> 01:56:07.101]  Well, anyway,
[01:56:07.791 --> 01:56:14.715]  My uncle was in the Marine Corps in Vietnam, and my grandfather was a coxswain in the Navy, and you know what?
[01:56:15.655 --> 01:56:17.876]  I knew Vietnam had done something to my uncle.
[01:56:18.076 --> 01:56:22.438]  He talked about blue zones, and well, he's died.
[01:56:22.458 --> 01:56:23.319]  He's passed on.
[01:56:24.079 --> 01:56:28.622]  And I do pray that God protects you and does his will in your life, Alex.
[01:56:29.262 --> 01:56:30.442]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:56:30.543 --> 01:56:34.224]  I mean, what is the info you had, though, about the martial law preparations?
[01:56:34.665 --> 01:56:37.286]  Well, you know, we've had checkpoints.
[01:56:38.038 --> 01:56:41.940]  Three months ago and also last week.
[01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:43.461]  And they're getting more and more frequent.
[01:56:43.501 --> 01:56:44.222]  We'll be right back.
[01:56:44.622 --> 01:56:45.862]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:46.463 --> 01:56:47.403]  This is incredible.
[01:56:47.503 --> 01:56:47.764]  U.S.
[01:56:47.804 --> 01:56:49.184]  Army trains to take on tea parties.
[01:56:50.325 --> 01:56:51.225]  We're on the march.
[01:56:51.706 --> 01:56:53.327]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:56:54.247 --> 01:56:56.929]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:02.873 --> 01:57:05.315]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:57:23.747 --> 01:57:29.291]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:57:29.691 --> 01:57:33.394]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:57:33.894 --> 01:57:37.917]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:57:38.197 --> 01:57:43.741]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:57:44.142 --> 01:57:47.124]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:57:47.704 --> 01:57:49.125]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:57:49.665 --> 01:57:50.106]  It's here.

[01:59:01.735 --> 01:59:02.876]  This is not a drill.
[01:59:02.956 --> 01:59:04.876]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[01:59:06.271 --> 01:59:07.072]  Staggering pace.

[02:00:04.775 --> 02:00:05.715]  We are back live.
[02:00:05.755 --> 02:00:15.780]  I'm going to go to John in Kansas military, Sandra, Texas veteran, Henry, Michigan ex-military, and others here in just a moment.
[02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:18.261]  Then I want to get into some financial news.
[02:00:18.701 --> 02:00:28.146]  I'm not going to have time today to get into Bill Gates saying we need to vaccinate the population, to quote, reduce the population, that's a quote, and that we need to have zero carbon dioxide
[02:00:28.806 --> 02:00:49.633]  Output bring it to zero which humans exhaled He said that in the same speech and the big crowd of globalists were laughing and smiling and giggling just pure evil I'll have to cover that tomorrow and integrate it with a new video clip with similar things being said and pushed We're the same group that Bill Gates is promoting was in a speech they were saying that
[02:00:51.462 --> 02:00:56.184]  We need to be like China, who's now giving people jobs according to their genetics and their DNA.
[02:00:56.484 --> 02:00:58.705]  This is the essence of eugenics.
[02:00:58.725 --> 02:01:04.768]  We're going to cover that tomorrow, because this broke during the show, and Paul Watson and Kurt Nimmo put an article together.
[02:01:05.408 --> 02:01:08.670]  The latest version is at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:01:09.790 --> 02:01:10.130]  U.S.
[02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:12.651]  Army trains to confront Tea Party terrorists.
[02:01:13.212 --> 02:01:17.674]  It describes Tea Partiers as former vets who are drunkards who hate the government.
[02:01:18.334 --> 02:01:20.075]  They're training to kill military and police.
[02:01:20.515 --> 02:01:25.839]  It describes them as absolute scum, trash, and white supremacist and says they must be taken on.
[02:01:26.319 --> 02:01:35.324]  And they have drills where the Tea Party people are absolute scum and where the military takes them on and kills some and takes others to FEMA camps.
[02:01:35.945 --> 02:01:36.205]  U.S.
[02:01:36.265 --> 02:01:38.786]  Army trains to confront Tea Party terrorists is the headline.
[02:01:39.127 --> 02:01:45.631]  Military personnel blow the whistle on exercise which involved troops taking protesters to concentration camps.
[02:01:46.604 --> 02:01:50.966]  And then he goes through all of that, and we have the actual army documents.
[02:01:51.506 --> 02:01:54.007]  And of course, the Courier-Journal's reporting this like it's a good thing.
[02:01:54.207 --> 02:01:55.287]  This is in mainstream news.
[02:01:56.348 --> 02:01:58.989]  And they had an exercise the 23rd of this month and the 26th.
[02:01:59.029 --> 02:02:03.311]  They're having similar ones all over the country.
[02:02:03.331 --> 02:02:13.575]  But again, you can go to the website and read these documents, where they just absolutely train the troops that the American people are the enemy.
[02:02:14.659 --> 02:02:19.543]  And this is all ahead of government-staged attacks to be blamed on the American people.
[02:02:19.563 --> 02:02:23.947]  And then Curt and Watson go through and give all these examples.
[02:02:24.007 --> 02:02:32.455]  The New York Times, you know, where kids are being trained, the Boy Scouts to take on disgruntled veterans and kill them and seek and destroy operations.
[02:02:32.875 --> 02:02:39.582]  We reported on Missouri National Guard unit at Camp Crowder engaging training exercises designed to take on fictitious militia group.
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:46.286]  Article after article, Marines running checkpoints, Army running checkpoints.
[02:02:47.067 --> 02:02:54.277]  In Iowa, when we interviewed the colonel involved, they admitted they're doing door-to-door gun confiscation drills against the American people.
[02:02:55.478 --> 02:03:00.661]  We give you some of the backstory and other examples to give you a clear picture of exactly what's going on.
[02:03:00.721 --> 02:03:06.404]  I mean, this is just insane what is happening right now.
[02:03:07.064 --> 02:03:09.545]  And you can see it all building towards ahead.
[02:03:10.526 --> 02:03:12.567]  John in Kansas, who's military.
[02:03:13.127 --> 02:03:15.528]  Go ahead, John, tell us about any information you have on this.
[02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:18.410]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:03:19.130 --> 02:03:24.773]  I guess, you know, we've all been instructed not to talk about
[02:03:25.959 --> 02:03:31.251]  The preparations that are being made, particularly training that is being given right now to
[02:03:35.902 --> 02:03:37.063]  First of all, they're going into the Army.
[02:03:37.583 --> 02:03:38.384]  Oh, I forgot!
[02:03:38.644 --> 02:03:46.450]  That was in the news three years ago that San Antonio ROTC, that their drills are all to take on militias and kill them.
[02:03:46.730 --> 02:03:48.652]  See, I mean, I can't even remember all the cases.
[02:03:48.692 --> 02:03:48.952]  Sorry.
[02:03:49.112 --> 02:03:49.913]  That guy's Google.
[02:03:50.193 --> 02:03:53.735]  San Antonio ROTC training to kill militias.
[02:03:54.156 --> 02:03:54.576]  I'm sorry.
[02:03:54.656 --> 02:03:55.096]  Sorry, sir.
[02:03:55.116 --> 02:03:55.417]  Go ahead.
[02:03:56.057 --> 02:03:56.858]  No, no, that's fine.
[02:03:56.878 --> 02:03:59.860]  Yeah, the same thing like with the Boy Scouts that are being trained.
[02:04:00.519 --> 02:04:05.707]  uh... specifically go to target the uh... military and uh... you know military veterans
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:35.278]  and uh... militia members but it's I mean regardless nobody I'm going to shut up because this is key info but I just want to add this think about the magnitude that the real training isn't for muslims that are supposedly the boogeyman that are going to get us it's almost all for gun owning americans I mean the government is out of control and criminal I'm going to shut up you're saying you're being told not to talk we have all these documents the military is leaking so certainly a lot of the troops are upset tell us exactly what you know what you're being told and and and
[02:04:35.518 --> 02:04:37.119]  Give the militaries buying this, go ahead.
[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:55.092]  Yeah, and uh, so, so anyways, uh, training has been going on for at least the last two years now that, um, to specifically, uh, as soon as bootcamp is over, everyone, we're all going to be deployed onto the streets actually to work with the police.
[02:04:55.132 --> 02:05:00.196]  We're being trained to work with the police specifically to assist the police force on the ground.
[02:05:00.620 --> 02:05:03.861]  And four times of public dissent and civil unrest.
[02:05:04.421 --> 02:05:13.625]  And we're being taught crowd control, kettling techniques, I mean, you name it, it's in there, and it's all specifically targeted for dissenting Americans.
[02:05:13.765 --> 02:05:14.805]  And look at the G20!
[02:05:14.885 --> 02:05:18.146]  We have the troops there, we walk up and say, what about posse commentatus?
[02:05:18.447 --> 02:05:20.187]  And they say, we're here to aid the police.
[02:05:20.687 --> 02:05:21.568]  But that's illegal.
[02:05:23.568 --> 02:05:27.650]  And you notice that all of the personnel that were firing the sound cannons
[02:05:28.283 --> 02:05:29.904]  They were all military.
[02:05:29.944 --> 02:05:36.366]  That's because it is actually developed for war and control over in a war zone in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:05:36.406 --> 02:05:41.248]  So, you know, it's better to have the military personnel operating, you know, the devices of war.
[02:05:41.308 --> 02:05:43.249]  And they use the less lethal weapons.
[02:05:43.489 --> 02:05:46.350]  Even there, they call them less lethal, the rubber bullets and everything.
[02:05:46.570 --> 02:05:51.892]  And they have the troops now firing the guns, firing the sound cannons at the people.
[02:05:52.392 --> 02:05:54.893]  This is all a training aid towards real bullets.
[02:05:56.181 --> 02:05:56.422]  Right.
[02:05:56.863 --> 02:05:57.084]  Right.
[02:05:57.605 --> 02:06:03.781]  And it's just progressively, you know, as if, you know, I mean, imagine everybody always in the, you know,
[02:06:04.471 --> 02:06:05.211]  Protest and stuff.
[02:06:05.231 --> 02:06:05.992]  They're always running away.
[02:06:06.032 --> 02:06:06.692]  They're always scared.
[02:06:06.732 --> 02:06:07.633]  Nobody does anything.
[02:06:07.673 --> 02:06:15.276]  If anything, it's the provocateur, you know, undercovers that are actually doing the violence or the anarchists.
[02:06:15.556 --> 02:06:19.618]  So the military and the police have an excuse to engage them and they've been caught over and over again.
[02:06:19.999 --> 02:06:21.559]  Denver last year, Canada.
[02:06:21.579 --> 02:06:22.620]  Okay, okay.
[02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:23.961]  Please continue.
[02:06:24.261 --> 02:06:29.443]  Tell us what else they're training you for and what are other military people you're talking to?
[02:06:29.483 --> 02:06:30.824]  Are they starting to understand what's happening?
[02:06:32.101 --> 02:06:43.887]  Uh, well, the sad thing is you can get people to realize and agree on the Constitution and, you know, what they're supposed to uphold, but at the same time, nobody realizes how important it is.
[02:06:43.987 --> 02:06:47.068]  So I think when it comes down to it, most people are just going to fall in line.
[02:06:47.088 --> 02:06:51.170]  And if there's one or two dissenters in the ranks, well, we've been training how to deal with dissent.
[02:06:51.290 --> 02:06:52.391]  So they'll get dealt with.
[02:06:52.611 --> 02:06:53.311]  I mean, that's kind of that.
[02:06:53.331 --> 02:06:53.852]  Stop right there.
[02:06:54.192 --> 02:06:54.912]  Stop right there.
[02:06:55.172 --> 02:06:56.233]  They'll be dealt with.
[02:06:57.533 --> 02:06:58.534]  Tell us about that training.
[02:07:00.330 --> 02:07:02.832]  Well, again, I don't know how much we're supposed to go into.
[02:07:02.892 --> 02:07:04.814]  I mean, actually, I don't even think we're supposed to go into any of this.
[02:07:04.874 --> 02:07:05.394]  But you know what?
[02:07:05.414 --> 02:07:08.537]  Well, sir, this is all illegal, what's going on.
[02:07:08.657 --> 02:07:14.742]  And they're now acclimating the public with Marine Corps, Army, National Guard, Homeland Security checkpoints.
[02:07:15.043 --> 02:07:17.184]  The governor of Tennessee says they can't do what they do.
[02:07:17.224 --> 02:07:18.686]  They're doing it in California.
[02:07:19.166 --> 02:07:20.788]  They're surveilling everybody in Austin.
[02:07:21.008 --> 02:07:22.669]  They're building bases all over the place.
[02:07:22.949 --> 02:07:24.110]  I mean, this is all going on.
[02:07:24.170 --> 02:07:25.031]  This is criminal.
[02:07:25.291 --> 02:07:26.973]  This is our military we paid for.
[02:07:27.253 --> 02:07:30.795]  Well, just let me affirm, I can confirm that everything you talk about is 100% true.
[02:07:30.895 --> 02:07:34.397]  And there are so many people out there that are just so brainwashed.
[02:07:50.382 --> 02:08:02.889]  I don't know if it's if they're not smart enough or they just don't want to believe it because it seems so terrible because, you know, we've all been brought up now for, you know, what, 60 years straight now and this brainwashing of, oh, America is going to, you know, never do anything.
[02:08:02.909 --> 02:08:06.372]  You know, we're so much better and above all these other third world countries and stuff.
[02:08:06.412 --> 02:08:11.014]  And, you know, most of the time we're the ones going over there and starting to shit in third world countries.
[02:08:11.034 --> 02:08:12.875]  All right, sir.
[02:08:12.975 --> 02:08:14.396]  I appreciate your call, but be careful.
[02:08:16.514 --> 02:08:29.128]  Yeah, yeah, I don't... John, I understand you're upset and angry, but do you understand how essential it is for military men and women to go public to the mainstream media and to go on YouTube and to speak out?
[02:08:29.508 --> 02:08:33.212]  I mean, troops have said no, you know, after massacres.
[02:08:33.612 --> 02:08:37.576]  You have a... The Germans, just following orders, won't cover it.
[02:08:38.237 --> 02:08:40.999]  The Germans, people were hung who followed orders.
[02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:45.262]  And it is essential that all the military people come out and speak out.
[02:08:45.302 --> 02:08:46.644]  And obviously, you're calling in.
[02:08:46.924 --> 02:08:48.525]  These documents continue to get leaked.
[02:08:48.865 --> 02:08:52.688]  So that shows that the military at many levels is concerned.
[02:08:52.708 --> 02:08:53.489]  Do you have any other comments?
[02:08:54.890 --> 02:08:58.713]  I was wondering if you're going to be going to the G20 this year in Toronto.
[02:08:59.753 --> 02:09:00.754]  No, I'm probably not.
[02:09:00.854 --> 02:09:02.676]  I mean, I've got so many duties here.
[02:09:06.547 --> 02:09:11.189]  And then there's all the... I'm a big target now, but I do need to still go to events.
[02:09:11.229 --> 02:09:16.091]  It's just that... I mean, they can plant weapons on me that they've already tried in Denver.
[02:09:16.811 --> 02:09:18.112]  And people haven't lived it.
[02:09:18.132 --> 02:09:19.352]  They just haven't experienced it.
[02:09:19.512 --> 02:09:24.954]  And I... The operation I'm running is so important, that basically it's like I'm a general now.
[02:09:24.974 --> 02:09:33.118]  I've got to sit back in the headquarters, and I don't even morally like to send my guys off, because they get arrested and set up, and they tried to set the guys up when they were out there, but...
[02:09:34.318 --> 02:09:39.820]  I really should be going to these events, but more citizens should be going out to these events.
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:43.281]  But I've spent lots of time out in the field, believe me.
[02:09:43.461 --> 02:09:51.823]  I mean, until you have them try to set fires and blame it on you, you just don't know how hardcore this is and how much they've trained them to hate the American people.
[02:09:52.444 --> 02:09:53.344]  But God help us.
[02:09:54.404 --> 02:10:00.106]  John, separately, you know, we've had all these people calling in about how they were trained to take on militias.
[02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:02.467]  Specifically, I mean, we have their documents.
[02:10:02.507 --> 02:10:04.187]  It's tea parties, militias, everybody.
[02:10:04.587 --> 02:10:05.787]  I mean, have you seen any of that?
[02:10:05.807 --> 02:10:07.548]  Uh, yeah.
[02:10:07.568 --> 02:10:17.130]  I mean, that's specifically, you know, the people that are supposedly against the New World Order, that are against, uh, you know, and they all say that it's like, you know, these people are crazy, like, haha, there's no New World Order, you know.
[02:10:17.450 --> 02:10:24.012]  But this is what they think, and, you know, the people that are, uh, are against, uh, the Federal Reserve is a big one for some reason.
[02:10:24.032 --> 02:10:27.153]  Anybody who doesn't like the Federal Reserve is a terrorist, you know, I mean, so...
[02:10:28.153 --> 02:10:34.956]  Meanwhile, 99% of the American people are against the Federal Reserve.
[02:10:35.576 --> 02:10:38.738]  In national polls, it's above 80% want it abolished or audited.
[02:10:39.098 --> 02:10:45.341]  Everybody knows the bankers are a bunch of crooks at the national level, international level, and that's actually in
[02:10:46.281 --> 02:11:03.410]  Army documents we have and federal documents, so you're not telling us anything that isn't public, but specifically, so they get the commander up in front of the group, they show you PowerPoints, they laugh at people, it's all a big joke, I mean we have their, they call us drunks, they call us all these names, I mean is that basically what's going on?
[02:11:04.330 --> 02:11:13.515]  Right, I mean it's called, I mean it's just class, whenever you're going to class, I mean you get training provided to you, there's different types of training that you get, you know, there's the training in the classroom, there's training that's like actual hands-on,
[02:11:14.290 --> 02:11:28.253]  And you know the news drills with assisting with with National Guard and the police force and like national level Exercise that's NLE is a big one so you know everyone trains for that and the training just keeps getting more realistic and more and
[02:11:29.103 --> 02:11:34.487]  Specifically, he seems to be targeted directly at, you know, dissenting Americans that are just protecting their rights.
[02:11:34.547 --> 02:11:39.691]  You know, it doesn't really seem like anybody's doing anything that we haven't always done, you know, that makes us Americans.
[02:11:39.711 --> 02:11:49.818]  But in the drill manuals, in the scenario manuals, militias and Tea Party members are described as Ku Klux Klan, running around with guns that want to murder everyone, drinking whiskey.
[02:11:49.858 --> 02:11:55.683]  I mean, people can go read it right now, three pages of this garbage that was just going on four days ago.
[02:11:56.444 --> 02:11:58.711]  And it's total demonization.
[02:11:58.952 --> 02:12:00.597]  What type of demonization have you seen?
[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:06.163]  Well, uh, definitely, uh, they are beating into everyone's heads.
[02:12:06.323 --> 02:12:09.826]  Like, you know, that these people are personally have something against us.
[02:12:09.906 --> 02:12:13.569]  Like, so that they want to bring out, that's like kind of a psychological thing that I noticed they do.
[02:12:13.609 --> 02:12:18.152]  They try a lot of psychological getting you to, you know, think of them as not human.
[02:12:18.192 --> 02:12:19.533]  They're, you know, dehumanize them.
[02:12:19.593 --> 02:12:25.017]  So you don't care to go after them and use your full force against them and feel that there's definitely a threat on you against them.
[02:12:25.037 --> 02:12:26.578]  Like these people hate the military.
[02:12:26.618 --> 02:12:27.639]  They hate anybody who is,
[02:12:28.072 --> 02:12:34.579]  You know, they hate the police, they're cop killers, you know, and there's like specific examples they give, and like, you know, the Hutteri militia, they're trying to kill all the cops.
[02:12:34.639 --> 02:12:41.566]  I mean, that's why they're doing these things, so that way they can get us turned against them and not care, not look at them as American citizens.
[02:12:41.586 --> 02:12:43.128]  We're gonna look at them as traitors.
[02:12:43.648 --> 02:12:45.850]  And the sinners that need to be put down because...
[02:13:02.125 --> 02:13:04.606]  Marine killing the cops in Pittsburgh.
[02:13:04.987 --> 02:13:07.908]  They blamed me on the news and said I called for it.
[02:13:08.088 --> 02:13:11.890]  And it turned out the guy was a white supremacist and posted all over the internet hating me.
[02:13:11.971 --> 02:13:14.792]  National News was just here saying, are you going to cause violence?
[02:13:15.212 --> 02:13:17.133]  National News says I'm calling for violence.
[02:13:17.393 --> 02:13:20.435]  When I'm calling for the opposite, I'm pointing out they're going to stage it.
[02:13:20.655 --> 02:13:23.837]  So you can see the setup that is going on.
[02:13:23.857 --> 02:13:28.159]  And you're saying now it's almost entirely militia, gun owners, veterans.
[02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:29.580]  They hate America.
[02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:30.681]  We've got to get them.
[02:13:32.168 --> 02:13:37.749]  Well, the idea is that there's going to be a lot of unrest and that will be needed.
[02:13:37.869 --> 02:13:42.810]  So there's definitely going to be something false flag stage to bring in the need for us.
[02:13:43.330 --> 02:13:47.391]  I mean, it's not going to be just like we're going to go on the streets and roll out and say we've had enough of you guys.
[02:13:47.451 --> 02:13:54.352]  No, I mean, it's going to be like there's going to be some, you know, you know, proverbial, you know, stuff in the fan.
[02:13:54.372 --> 02:13:56.072]  So yeah, stuff in the fan.
[02:13:56.092 --> 02:14:00.933]  So so anyways, you know, it's going to be, you know, something going down and it's, you know,
[02:14:01.764 --> 02:14:11.398]  It seems to me like they might use anarchists or some type of provocateur, you know, when there's a moment of, like, you know, maybe when they raise taxes and, you know, everything just gets to a certain level.
[02:14:11.877 --> 02:14:14.718]  You know, you can feel the boiling point already in our society.
[02:14:14.738 --> 02:14:15.858]  Well, the system knows that.
[02:14:15.898 --> 02:14:20.600]  I mean, government's all just spending more, more taxes, grabbing everything, more, more, more.
[02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:26.442]  And then meanwhile, there's the military being trained that veterans are our enemy and they hate the military.
[02:14:26.702 --> 02:14:30.184]  I mean, how transparent does this have to get?
[02:14:30.224 --> 02:14:31.664]  And we know they set up Hattari.
[02:14:31.964 --> 02:14:38.687]  We know they write... I told Hattari in August of last year, I said, they're going to set you up and claim you want to kill cops.
[02:14:39.367 --> 02:14:46.994]  I had Sickles on the air, and I identified what that group was putting out, and that they had FBI inside leading it.
[02:14:47.135 --> 02:14:50.298]  And it's come out now in federal documents that that happened.
[02:14:50.338 --> 02:15:01.788]  I mean, I was able, just by watching, to specifically single out that intelligence operation because it was clownish how ridiculous it is, and now they're going to play out this script
[02:15:02.609 --> 02:15:05.511]  And the military's going to have their parents' pension funds taken.
[02:15:06.031 --> 02:15:09.874]  And if mom and dad speak up, you know, their kids will say, mom and dad were taken away.
[02:15:09.894 --> 02:15:11.955]  They didn't like America.
[02:15:11.975 --> 02:15:14.257]  And this is how it happens.
[02:15:14.337 --> 02:15:16.278]  This is Red Dawn, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:16.578 --> 02:15:19.000]  And they've massively built this up.
[02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:22.382]  They've never trained the military at one-tenth of what we see now.
[02:15:22.983 --> 02:15:28.667]  And again, I'm going to ask you, I mean, we heard earlier people calling in saying the military's waking up.
[02:15:29.107 --> 02:15:30.528]  Are you seeing the military wake up?
[02:15:31.890 --> 02:15:40.326]  I have really tried to wake up a lot of people and I find that for every, it's usually about for every 10 people you try, you get one to like fully awaken.
[02:15:41.095 --> 02:16:02.524]  But, you know, I'm definitely seeing at least 25% strong, or people in the military are at least aware that something's going on and probably 50% of the people, or let me say 50% of the people are aware that at least something's going on and 25% of the people are definitely enough in the know that when things start going that way, I think that there will be
[02:16:03.268 --> 02:16:11.594]  You know, maybe a dissension spring off from, you know, like, like the other caller said, I think, I don't really see how they're going to do it, you know, without bringing in the Blue Helmets.
[02:16:12.475 --> 02:16:14.496]  But I'm sure that's already in the works.
[02:16:14.516 --> 02:16:21.982]  Well, NLE09 at FEMA.gov says they were going to, they trained last year with troops from 14 countries to take on the American scum.
[02:16:23.603 --> 02:16:30.768]  Right, and, you know, I think that in 2010 that it's just going to be, I think, probably about four times as many
[02:16:32.196 --> 02:16:32.897]  Uh, foreign troops.
[02:16:33.878 --> 02:16:36.740]  So you see the foreign troops trying to take us on?
[02:16:37.901 --> 02:16:44.086]  Well, they're gonna have to because the foreign troops, you know, if anything, would love the chance to come in and, you know, beat up on Americans.
[02:16:44.387 --> 02:16:57.718]  You know, that's like, you know, because the same zeitgeist brainwashing that they do on our society, you know, to hate these, you know, evil people from other parts of the country, they do in other parts of the world to hate Americans.
[02:16:58.607 --> 02:16:59.748]  Well, let's be clear though.
[02:16:59.828 --> 02:17:12.678]  I've had military and police confirm to me, and pastors and the clergy response teams, that whole secret program that we broke that's now national news and confirmed, that they train them specifically that Alex Jones is evil.
[02:17:12.918 --> 02:17:16.240]  Have you been taught, look out for Alex Jones material?
[02:17:18.022 --> 02:17:25.087]  It's funny you ask that because Alex Jones, that training I was given was actually one of the reasons why I really started to listen to you.
[02:17:26.323 --> 02:17:28.144]  Good, it's backfiring on the enemy operation.
[02:17:28.424 --> 02:17:32.206]  We're going to defend America, we're going to defeat the global banking takeover.
[02:17:32.267 --> 02:17:40.391]  Imagine, the veterans are bad, the patriots, people that don't want the banking takeover are bad, Alex Jones is pure evil, and so what were they saying?
[02:17:40.732 --> 02:17:42.493]  This guy is very dangerous, this is what I've been told.
[02:17:42.733 --> 02:17:45.254]  Stay there, I've got to come back to you briefly, I've got to hit some financial news.
[02:17:45.654 --> 02:17:48.336]  This man right here, Alex Jones, has a kernel of truth.
[02:17:48.756 --> 02:17:53.179]  This man is very persuasive, he is deceptive, and he wants to kill cops.
[02:17:53.539 --> 02:17:58.402]  This man is evil, and you must realize that he may be with Al Qaeda.
[02:18:00.803 --> 02:18:02.204]  Don't answer it!

[02:21:01.090 --> 02:21:06.152]  Hundreds of national and international publications are lying and saying I'm calling for violence.
[02:21:06.232 --> 02:21:08.712]  You listen for years, you know that's a lie.
[02:21:10.453 --> 02:21:19.916]  The ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, mainstream television crews, Nightline, PBS, you name it, hear every week, CNN.
[02:21:20.456 --> 02:21:23.217]  They are really targeting me as the main enemy.
[02:21:24.352 --> 02:21:25.153]  And why is that?
[02:21:25.533 --> 02:21:29.436]  Because I know their program, I've studied them, I understand their operation.
[02:21:29.916 --> 02:21:34.940]  I am an American, I am a patriot, and the enemy are the foreign banks that now run our military.
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:39.583]  Our military is not our enemy, they're our friends, so are the police, but we've got to wake them up now.
[02:21:40.303 --> 02:21:41.784]  Now, uh, for...
[02:21:42.961 --> 02:21:45.183]  Sandra, Harry, Beth, and others.
[02:21:45.223 --> 02:21:46.824]  Tomorrow, we'll spend an hour or two.
[02:21:47.424 --> 02:21:48.345]  I don't have time to get to you.
[02:21:48.385 --> 02:21:51.347]  I apologize for all the other military people calling in with intel.
[02:21:51.667 --> 02:21:55.590]  But everything John's been saying separately is already confirmed in mainstream documents.
[02:21:55.690 --> 02:21:55.930]  U.S.
[02:21:55.970 --> 02:21:58.732]  Army trains to confront Tea Party terrorists.
[02:21:59.473 --> 02:22:01.694]  Tea Party, you are being demonized.
[02:22:02.995 --> 02:22:04.656]  And Limbaugh better talk about this.
[02:22:05.056 --> 02:22:06.357]  Savage better talk about this.
[02:22:06.417 --> 02:22:07.578]  We better get this out.
[02:22:08.159 --> 02:22:09.459]  And we may be able to save this country.
[02:22:09.479 --> 02:22:10.981]  They're not going to go with this operation.
[02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:16.293]  And stage an attack as the pretext, unless we lay down and let them do it.
[02:22:16.354 --> 02:22:18.015]  We've got to get the info out now.
[02:22:18.055 --> 02:22:19.376]  This article is so important.
[02:22:19.896 --> 02:22:20.137]  U.S.
[02:22:20.197 --> 02:22:21.918]  Army trains to confront Tea Party terrorists.
[02:22:21.958 --> 02:22:28.924]  Now, I can tell you how many military people, and I've also been in reports, I mean, I've gotten government reports, where my name is there.
[02:22:29.464 --> 02:22:33.668]  Now, why do you, specifically, what were they saying about me in the training?
[02:22:34.861 --> 02:22:38.245]  That you are a conspiracy den, basically.
[02:22:38.986 --> 02:22:44.913]  You would be considered a leader in the, like, radical expression, I guess.
[02:22:45.573 --> 02:22:47.496]  So I'm like Osama bin Laden, basically.
[02:22:48.530 --> 02:22:48.830]  Yeah.
[02:22:48.850 --> 02:22:51.793]  If they had a deck of cards for the Patriots, that'd be the Aces page.
[02:22:52.954 --> 02:22:54.495]  You'd be up there, yeah.
[02:22:54.555 --> 02:23:06.545]  But, you know, see, what you do is, you know, the people that are susceptible to be radicalized or whatever, you would be, you know, what basically is you're waking them up, you know, but they view that as, you know, radicalization.
[02:23:06.565 --> 02:23:09.428]  So, you know, people that have been radicalized
[02:23:10.020 --> 02:23:13.022]  You know, it's kind of like the red and blue list thing.
[02:23:13.703 --> 02:23:26.433]  You know, you would be somebody on the red list, definitely, and the blue list people would be like your listeners that are kind of like, would fall in line with you if there was a movement that started, but at the same time could probably be brainwashed to fall back into society.
[02:23:26.553 --> 02:23:28.995]  And do they imply that I'm calling for violence?
[02:23:30.736 --> 02:23:32.117]  Well, uh, yes.
[02:23:33.338 --> 02:23:35.220]  Because we know that's the public script.
[02:23:36.638 --> 02:23:36.838]  Right.
[02:23:37.299 --> 02:23:40.142]  And, uh, it's, uh, uh, dangerous rhetoric.
[02:23:40.363 --> 02:23:46.350]  You know, it is, uh, you know, violent, uh, uh, you know, dangerous, violent rhetoric and those types of things.
[02:23:48.406 --> 02:24:02.957]  Yeah, I'm on the air saying for 15 years that the military is secretly training to go after gun owners and patriots, and now they're going, we're getting ready to go after gun owners and patriots, and these nuts think we're getting ready to go after gun owners, veterans, and patriots.
[02:24:03.237 --> 02:24:04.318]  These people are crazy!
[02:24:04.538 --> 02:24:05.959]  They think we're getting ready to go after them!
[02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:07.761]  That's why we're training to go after them!
[02:24:09.357 --> 02:24:09.898]  Exactly.
[02:24:10.238 --> 02:24:15.021]  That's always the conundrum that I usually use to stump people that are kind of not wanting to believe it.
[02:24:15.561 --> 02:24:16.501]  Sir, we're out of time.
[02:24:16.581 --> 02:24:17.562]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:24:17.602 --> 02:24:18.202]  God bless you.
[02:24:18.623 --> 02:24:19.783]  Ted's been holding for 30 minutes.
[02:24:19.823 --> 02:24:23.445]  I wanted to get Ted up so people could financially protect themselves with gold and silver.
[02:24:23.465 --> 02:24:27.408]  He bought gold back when it was $1,060 an ounce.
[02:24:27.428 --> 02:24:28.308]  It's $1,170 right now.
[02:24:28.388 --> 02:24:29.909]  Ted, I apologize for making you hold.
[02:24:30.249 --> 02:24:31.630]  This is such incredible info.
[02:24:31.650 --> 02:24:34.552]  In the last minute and a half, throw out the gold offer for today.
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:39.623]  Yeah, we're going to be offering the Frank at $249.68.
[02:24:40.043 --> 02:24:42.386]  You know, there's hardly enough time to talk about it.
[02:24:42.426 --> 02:24:45.129]  We'll follow up with an email to show people what it is.
[02:24:45.169 --> 02:24:46.630]  Maybe you can put it up on the website.
[02:24:46.971 --> 02:24:52.757]  But it's such a great buy because you're getting the full year subscription to Bob Chapman's International Forecaster.
[02:24:53.357 --> 02:24:59.224]  And I've got to say, with the information that you have and the kind of stuff that he's providing, I don't know how people can afford not to take this.
[02:25:00.226 --> 02:25:02.707]  You've got gold at cheaper than anywhere else.
[02:25:02.727 --> 02:25:06.568]  You can find it because you bought it when it was low and you're selling it when it's high at the old low price.
[02:25:06.588 --> 02:25:06.628]  800-686-2237.
[02:25:06.648 --> 02:25:06.688]  800-686-2237.
[02:25:06.748 --> 02:25:08.829]  Ted, we ought to just do 20 minutes tomorrow on the economy.
[02:25:08.849 --> 02:25:08.889]  800-686-2237.
[02:25:20.245 --> 02:25:22.426]  So important to protect yourself from these bankers.
[02:25:23.047 --> 02:25:27.770]  And Ted, thank you so much for coming on with us and associating with somebody as evil as me.
[02:25:29.851 --> 02:25:30.671]  God bless you all.
[02:25:30.711 --> 02:25:33.113]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:33.753 --> 02:25:35.294]  God Almighty, it's getting crazy.
