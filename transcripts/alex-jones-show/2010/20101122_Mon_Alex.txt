[00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.091]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:06.811]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.532 --> 00:00:08.672]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:10.113]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.893 --> 00:00:11.833]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:16.035]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:20.696]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:28.163]  We're live, my friends.
[00:00:28.283 --> 00:00:37.035]  It is Monday, the 22nd day of November, 2010, as we kick off this Thanksgiving week.
[00:00:38.136 --> 00:00:43.603]  The TSA is bracing for the opt-outers who don't want to be put in the microwave.
[00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:55.937]  I was looking at some of the TSA released images where they're trying to console the public, and even in the TSA naked body scan released images, you can see the bones in people's fingers.
[00:00:56.797 --> 00:01:09.399]  The radiation is penetrating that deep, and they admit they've been giving the public derezzed images, and we've got all these top radiologists and scientists on record saying these things are dangerous.
[00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:13.000]  There have been huge developments on that front that's coming up after the break.
[00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.445]  Also, a great article from the Economic Collapse blog.
[00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:18.007]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:01:18.548 --> 00:01:19.790]  Full-spectrum dominance.
[00:01:19.911 --> 00:01:27.383]  Eight examples of how the government is attempting to take control of our food, our health, our money, and even our dignity.
[00:01:29.347 --> 00:01:33.189]  Top US military officer says Al Qaeda threat from Yemen is serious.
[00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:43.894]  You notice right as the population says no to the naked body scanners, magically the toner cartridges get mailed and now that there's more pressure, Yemen's gonna try to strike.
[00:01:44.654 --> 00:01:45.735]  And I noticed that
[00:01:47.338 --> 00:02:00.128]  Two days before the German bomb event of last week, magically, the Germans were saying that they were bracing for more bombs on planes.
[00:02:00.688 --> 00:02:04.872]  German government warns a possible November terror attack.
[00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:13.738]  And then there was a bomb last, what, Friday on that German plane, or Thursday.
[00:02:14.778 --> 00:02:17.661]  And it turned out over the weekend, it was the U.S.
[00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:18.162]  government.
[00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:30.514]  Now, the evidence shows that's what happened with the printer cartridges, and the British government said these are not bombs, and Obama said, uh-uh, I'm giving a press conference, they are bombs.
[00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:31.535]  Check them again.
[00:02:32.432 --> 00:02:35.616]  It's kind of like Bush saying, uh, Saddam did have WMDs.
[00:02:36.377 --> 00:02:37.799]  My daddy sold them to him.
[00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:38.680]  Check the receipt.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.846]  You know, that's a popular joke, but, uh, that's basically what went on there.
[00:02:43.926 --> 00:02:49.012]  So, uh, you need to check those bombs again, uh, because like Carnac the Magnificent,
[00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:56.457]  Back to the days of Johnny Carson putting the envelope up to his head and saying, hmm, yes, let me see what it may be.
[00:02:56.477 --> 00:02:57.837]  It's the same thing here.
[00:02:58.338 --> 00:02:59.779]  The British say, this is not a bomb.
[00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.600]  And Obama's like, hmm, yes, it is.
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.841]  I'm 6,000 miles away.
[00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:04.641]  Yes, it is.
[00:03:05.982 --> 00:03:07.343]  They stand to gain from it.
[00:03:07.723 --> 00:03:14.927]  They get to fearmonger, churn off, and others get to make millions of dollars individually off of the machines being put in.
[00:03:14.967 --> 00:03:16.388]  We get trained how to be slaves.
[00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:24.082]  And in plain view of everyone, Obama tells them, you need to re-diagnose those packages.
[00:03:24.222 --> 00:03:25.063]  And oh, guess what?
[00:03:25.103 --> 00:03:26.583]  The president was right.
[00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:28.824]  They were bombs.
[00:03:29.645 --> 00:03:35.668]  So there's been new developments on that front where they're talking about Al-Qaeda hitting us over Thanksgiving, hitting us over Christmas.
[00:03:35.688 --> 00:03:37.749]  Look, we don't like sticking our hands in your pants.
[00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:39.530]  In your underwear.
[00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:42.953]  But it's gotta be done or Al-Qaeda's gonna get you.
[00:03:43.613 --> 00:03:45.175]  But the border is wide open.
[00:03:46.056 --> 00:03:48.298]  Also, huge developments on the economic front.
[00:03:48.658 --> 00:03:51.601]  Pessimistic Fed to slash growth forecast.
[00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:55.124]  I thought the recession ended a year and a half ago, back in June of 2009.
[00:03:58.308 --> 00:04:17.360]  You notice that in Ireland, and in Spain, and in Greece, and in Portugal, the list goes on and on, the bigger the bailouts, totaling 60% of the Irish economy, in just one bailout for Ireland they're talking about, they admit that ahead of the next bailout, that, oh, that won't fix it either.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.701]  See, it's a mathematical black hole.
[00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:21.522]  It's impossible to pay off.
[00:04:21.943 --> 00:04:25.785]  This is the bankster system where they hold us hostage.
[00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:26.946]  That's coming up.
[00:04:27.586 --> 00:04:31.768]  Head of the UN climate body admits surprise at fury over blunder in report.
[00:04:32.528 --> 00:04:41.072]  They're spinning the Climategate email debacle as errors.
[00:04:41.532 --> 00:04:42.633]  It's not errors.
[00:04:42.993 --> 00:04:47.635]  They're in there talking about how to lie and say the earth is warming.
[00:04:48.792 --> 00:04:50.575]  All right, it's all coming up.
[00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:55.041]  Plus, Geraldo Rivera goes back on record again questioning Building 7 collapse.
[00:04:55.442 --> 00:04:56.604]  He's got a lot of courage.
[00:04:56.664 --> 00:04:57.465]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:57.485 --> 00:04:57.946]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.893]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.213 --> 00:05:04.814]  Number 1.
[00:05:05.134 --> 00:05:08.276]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:08.557 --> 00:05:09.117]  Number 2.
[00:05:09.417 --> 00:05:13.961]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:14.761]  It's true.
[00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:19.605]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:19.925 --> 00:05:20.465]  Number 3.
[00:05:20.746 --> 00:05:24.028]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.328 --> 00:05:28.051]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.231 --> 00:05:28.792]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.032 --> 00:05:31.394]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:31.794 --> 00:05:35.178]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.478 --> 00:05:36.018]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.182]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:45.167]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:45.447 --> 00:05:49.468]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:49.628 --> 00:05:51.169]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:05.333]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:06:06.553 --> 00:06:11.314]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:11.694 --> 00:06:13.555]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:06:15.765 --> 00:06:26.590]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.772]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:36.635]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:06:37.336 --> 00:06:38.117]  Others don't.
[00:06:38.577 --> 00:06:40.458]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:42.200]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.062]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:06:45.382 --> 00:06:51.647]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:06:52.028 --> 00:06:54.210]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.752]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:06:57.092 --> 00:06:57.953]  Others don't.
[00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:05.691]  Hello, Alex Jones has told you about the delicious, safe, easy to fix, and very storable food from eFoods Direct.
[00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:09.392]  He's also told you that eFoods Direct has the best food on the planet.
[00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:10.793]  Well, here's the great news.
[00:07:11.213 --> 00:07:14.354]  It's that time of year, and their holiday special is here.

[00:07:24.239 --> 00:07:30.723]  And the second is a five-week supply of quick and easy meals, including delicious bakery items shipped in heavy-duty totes.
[00:07:31.023 --> 00:07:33.084]  Both are special values for the holidays.

[00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:44.972]  These holiday packs are always special combinations of food that are not available at any other time of the year.
[00:07:45.192 --> 00:07:45.472]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:07:45.492 --> 00:07:47.574]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:07:47.614 --> 00:07:48.214]  That's 800-409-5633.
[00:07:48.394 --> 00:07:51.176]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:08:04.554 --> 00:08:08.778]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:10.220]  You want answers?
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:11.961]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.522 --> 00:08:16.166]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.726 --> 00:08:20.810]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.745 --> 00:08:33.648]  The TSA is now beginning to completely collapse.
[00:08:34.648 --> 00:08:42.914]  Public opinion is solidly against them, despite the fact that they've been putting out fake polls of how they enjoy over 80% support.
[00:08:42.954 --> 00:08:54.062]  Those polls fly in the face of just common street buzz and many other scientific polls that show the complete opposite of what CBS News and others are reporting.
[00:08:55.529 --> 00:09:04.898]  Most polls show over 90%, including Reuters, 96% against the TESA and what they're doing, and folks saying they're not going to fly in record numbers.
[00:09:05.358 --> 00:09:08.761]  And tourism is completely imploding.
[00:09:09.462 --> 00:09:12.125]  Record numbers of people refusing to fly or travel.
[00:09:12.625 --> 00:09:14.046]  We've seen this trend since 2006 accelerating.
[00:09:18.086 --> 00:09:20.908]  That is all coming up as well today.
[00:09:21.449 --> 00:09:22.270]  We are live.
[00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.632]  It is Monday, the 22nd day of November, 2010.
[00:09:25.012 --> 00:09:35.261]  We're going to get Joel Skousen, political analyst, on to talk about a host of issues with us today in the third hour.
[00:09:35.881 --> 00:09:37.442]  He's also got some new breaking news.
[00:09:39.813 --> 00:09:43.496]  Terrorism, conspiracy in the UK involving the Bank of England.
[00:09:43.897 --> 00:09:45.858]  Lord James to the House of Lords.
[00:09:46.339 --> 00:09:48.681]  I laundered money for the IRA.
[00:09:49.421 --> 00:09:55.567]  And it's come out for a long time in England, even in the BBC and Guardian, that the British government
[00:09:56.559 --> 00:10:10.252]  He ran the violent arm of the IRA for decades to demonize the peaceful arm of the IRA and as a pretext to keep troops in Northern Ireland.
[00:10:11.113 --> 00:10:12.634]  So this is the oldest trick in the book.
[00:10:12.674 --> 00:10:17.719]  You stage events as a pretext to use force against a wider group you wish to persecute.
[00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:18.900]  That is coming up.
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.043]  We'll also get his take on the economy, on stage terror.
[00:10:23.204 --> 00:10:28.348]  On what's happening politically in this nation and a lot more today.
[00:10:29.288 --> 00:10:32.911]  Also, we've got a lot of other amazing news here in the stack.
[00:10:33.552 --> 00:10:37.775]  In fact, let me just go ahead and start going through the headlines themselves.
[00:10:38.235 --> 00:10:43.860]  Then I'm going to fire the toll-free number out and have wide open phones throughout the full transmission.
[00:10:45.161 --> 00:10:47.943]  Pessimistic Fed to slash growth forecast.
[00:10:47.983 --> 00:10:50.905]  Federal Reserve says things aren't as good as they previously said.
[00:10:51.646 --> 00:10:51.786]  Hmm.
[00:10:52.984 --> 00:10:56.807]  Nobody's buying their propaganda now, so to have some credibility, they're telling a little bit of the truth.
[00:10:57.327 --> 00:11:03.231]  Bloomberg reports Ireland is second Euro nation to seek aid as banks wobble.
[00:11:04.332 --> 00:11:13.078]  They want a bailout that's roughly 60% of their total economy, and they go on to report here that that's not even expected to help, but they still are going to do it.
[00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:17.021]  The bigger the bailouts, the bigger the hole is.
[00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:20.203]  Again, it's a black hole, mathematically impossible to pay back.
[00:11:20.484 --> 00:11:22.285]  It's designed that way, to transfer all wealth
[00:11:23.578 --> 00:11:24.719]  To the private central banks.
[00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:30.622]  Irish EU IMF rescue would dwarf Greek bailout on bank cost.
[00:11:30.802 --> 00:11:40.627]  Ireland will seek emergency international aid totaling as much as 60% of the size of its economy, dwarfing the Greek bailout to save its banks and bolster its finances.
[00:11:43.237 --> 00:11:49.998]  They will ask for 95 billion euros or 130 billion US dollars from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.
[00:11:50.058 --> 00:11:51.398]  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
[00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:59.100]  estimates Unicredit SA put the package as much as 85 billion euros while Deutsche Bank sees a 90 billion euro plan.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:06.381]  The 110 billion euro aid for Greece in May was an equivalent of 47% of its gross domestic product.
[00:12:08.601 --> 00:12:10.902]  And they will have to massively increase taxes
[00:12:12.048 --> 00:12:18.715]  to give the money to the private central banks who will then loan them money back at interest.
[00:12:20.116 --> 00:12:22.758]  Oh yes, this is what it's all about.
[00:12:22.818 --> 00:12:30.085]  Being in the Euro or in the North American Union is about being straightjacketed by the banks so they can then suck you dry.
[00:12:30.987 --> 00:12:32.569]  We told you this is where the Euro was leading.
[00:12:32.869 --> 00:12:34.050]  It was set up to do this.
[00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:35.351]  Many of their founders admitted that.
[00:12:36.472 --> 00:12:41.497]  Analysts, Irish EU bailout may not stop Portugal follow-up.
[00:12:41.577 --> 00:12:45.140]  Of course it won't stop a Portugal follow-up, as Reuters is saying.
[00:12:45.541 --> 00:12:46.822]  It's designed to do that.
[00:12:48.257 --> 00:13:01.286]  The European Union bailout of Ireland may give short-term relief to markets, but despite Eurozone hopes, may not prevent markets from pushing Portugal to get EU assistance unless a more general solution is found soon.
[00:13:02.807 --> 00:13:04.508]  Here's a report out of CNBC.
[00:13:04.648 --> 00:13:07.370]  In bailouts, Spain will be the biggest.
[00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.792]  Oh yeah, Spain's coming after Ireland and Portugal.
[00:13:11.473 --> 00:13:12.714]  And then it's going to be England.
[00:13:13.396 --> 00:13:14.737]  And then it's going to be France.
[00:13:15.277 --> 00:13:17.878]  And then it's going to be Germany and every other country.
[00:13:18.178 --> 00:13:25.521]  When you look at the European Union, it is a holding company of unelected bureaucrats.
[00:13:26.878 --> 00:13:33.182]  Over the nations, just like the World Trade Organization is a group of unelected bureaucrats, that the governments have signed their authority over to.
[00:13:33.562 --> 00:13:34.903]  And it's a receivership arm.
[00:13:35.323 --> 00:13:43.909]  And after they're done bankrupting Europe, they'll bankrupt them again, and again, and again, until you live like people in Nigeria or Argentina.
[00:13:44.963 --> 00:13:50.045]  Continuing, the biggest bailout the European Union will have to do, if it comes to it, will be Spain.
[00:13:50.525 --> 00:13:54.646]  And it's worrying that there is not a set mechanism of how to go about it.
[00:13:55.466 --> 00:13:57.687]  And of course, the bailouts work two ways.
[00:13:58.087 --> 00:14:00.388]  The Germans and others have to pay tax money in.
[00:14:00.408 --> 00:14:04.689]  The Brits have to pay tax money in to bail out Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece.
[00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:08.100]  Eastern European nations as well.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.122]  Notice it started with them two years ago.
[00:14:11.082 --> 00:14:12.623]  The taxpayers have got to pay for that.
[00:14:12.963 --> 00:14:14.905]  Then they go into more debt to the bankers.
[00:14:14.945 --> 00:14:19.488]  Then they get loans from the bankers at the national level and have to pay taxes on that.
[00:14:19.888 --> 00:14:23.811]  And then the Irish and others, they've got to pay back to the same bankers.
[00:14:24.051 --> 00:14:26.813]  And it's all just made up zeros and ones out of a computer.
[00:14:27.614 --> 00:14:29.095]  This is the mega fraud.
[00:14:29.878 --> 00:14:36.344]  So of course the big banks lobbied for big government and high debt rates and higher interest rates.
[00:14:37.025 --> 00:14:42.630]  And as Ireland loses its credit rating, the cost to service their debt just last week doubled.
[00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.552]  So you see how you never get out of it mathematically.
[00:14:47.434 --> 00:14:49.236]  So it goes into Spain in this report.
[00:14:50.795 --> 00:14:55.836]  Continuing, Geithner says Obama opposes depriving Fed of employment mandate.
[00:14:56.336 --> 00:15:03.298]  They're always spinning it like, you're not going to take away the power of the private Federal Reserve to save America.
[00:15:04.198 --> 00:15:06.918]  We're not going to take the mandate away to create jobs.
[00:15:07.438 --> 00:15:14.540]  Then you read the mandate, it's the mandate, the unelected bureaucratic power outside of government as
[00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:19.240]  Greenspan told Laird NewsHour last year that they are unregulatable.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.802]  Remember Dick Cheney saying, I'm not even part of the executive, I'm in my own branch?
[00:15:24.222 --> 00:15:25.042]  It's just made up.
[00:15:25.762 --> 00:15:28.764]  It's like Bush ordering people to torture and saying because he can.
[00:15:29.324 --> 00:15:29.944]  No, he can't.
[00:15:29.964 --> 00:15:30.924]  You're not above the law.
[00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:35.286]  Or TSA saying they can stick their hands down your pants.
[00:15:35.346 --> 00:15:35.906]  No, they can't.
[00:15:36.266 --> 00:15:38.127]  Just because they say they're God doesn't make it so.
[00:15:39.073 --> 00:15:42.754]  And they're also in the news saying, let's not politicize the Federal Reserve.
[00:15:42.774 --> 00:15:42.954]  Come on.
[00:15:43.294 --> 00:15:46.675]  Let's leave it outside of debate, outside of criticism.
[00:15:47.115 --> 00:15:57.118]  Everybody, you just forget it exists, and let's not discuss its role, its dominant role, its complete role in governing our economy and our society and creating this crisis.
[00:15:57.478 --> 00:15:59.959]  They're also in the Associated Press saying that.
[00:16:05.694 --> 00:16:07.495]  Crisis of fiat currency, U.S.
[00:16:07.535 --> 00:16:09.357]  dollar surpluses converted into gold.
[00:16:09.977 --> 00:16:12.319]  Something's going on that our government does not want you to know about.
[00:16:12.699 --> 00:16:16.542]  Very few journalists have written about it and little or nothing has appeared in the mainstream media.
[00:16:17.062 --> 00:16:19.084]  The story could be one of the major stories of our time.
[00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:24.468]  This is fresh out from Bob Chapman today, international forecaster, up on InfoWars.com.
[00:16:24.968 --> 00:16:30.032]  Western powers have tried to destroy gold as a backing for currencies for many years.
[00:16:30.132 --> 00:16:32.614]  Presently, the major media won't touch the story.
[00:16:33.334 --> 00:16:35.255]  And that is understandable.
[00:16:35.756 --> 00:16:42.500]  Something we have been writing about for years is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, known as SCO.
[00:16:43.061 --> 00:16:48.765]  Few have been listening and few have been interested in what their mission is and what they've been up to.
[00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:54.854]  Some of the members are large oil producers and some, like China, are large oil users.
[00:16:55.235 --> 00:16:56.976]  Some have very large dollar surpluses.
[00:16:57.257 --> 00:17:00.960]  As well, some are large commodity and gold and silver buyers.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.785]  In fact, members are in a great part responsible for driving these prices higher.
[00:17:07.205 --> 00:17:07.886]  It is debatable
[00:17:08.286 --> 00:17:15.490]  But we believe there is a conscious effort to accumulate gold and silver, dump dollars, and back their currencies with gold.
[00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.092]  Then he goes through the evidence of that, a major move into gold.
[00:17:19.132 --> 00:17:20.113]  That's why it's been going up.
[00:17:21.233 --> 00:17:26.136]  So you've got some of the globalist interests buying gold and silver, while the big mega-central banks try to drive it down.
[00:17:28.834 --> 00:17:32.378]  And there's more and more protesting against the private central banks going on.
[00:17:32.779 --> 00:17:38.345]  International soccer star, reclaim your power by pulling your money out of your bank December 7th.
[00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:47.776]  And it says most Americans haven't heard of him, but Eric Cantona is a huge international soccer star known throughout Europe and much of the world.
[00:17:48.076 --> 00:17:51.680]  Cantona is calling for Europeans to pull their money out of the banks December 7th.
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:18:00.048]  And he goes into the New World Order, he goes into how these banks are controlling everything, how they're engineering control of our society, how they're the real enemy.
[00:18:00.508 --> 00:18:03.812]  The world is awake and staring at the true ruling class.
[00:18:07.418 --> 00:18:10.561]  Here's another key story from Krypton.com.
[00:18:10.901 --> 00:18:12.923]  Could millionaires fleeing the U.S.
[00:18:12.943 --> 00:18:15.045]  cause a wild card economic event?
[00:18:15.646 --> 00:18:16.286]  Absolutely.
[00:18:16.306 --> 00:18:17.327]  We'll be breaking that down.
[00:18:17.627 --> 00:18:24.674]  So that's just some of what is in the economic stack here today on the
[00:18:26.932 --> 00:18:28.593]  Front of 9-11 Truth.
[00:18:28.613 --> 00:18:30.034]  We'll play this video later.
[00:18:30.054 --> 00:18:33.797]  Geraldo expands his 9-1-1 comments.
[00:18:34.277 --> 00:18:37.679]  Says, WTC collapse reminiscent of controlled demolition.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:45.244]  Judge Andrew Napolitano put him on the hot seat and said, so you're questioning 9-11 Truth.
[00:18:46.385 --> 00:18:48.667]  So you're saying the folks that talk about that aren't bad.
[00:18:48.687 --> 00:18:51.428]  And Geraldo says, no, it looks like they could be right.
[00:18:52.839 --> 00:18:54.720]  Uh, he looks like it could be a controlled demolition.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.180]  It's, it's quote, reminiscent of one.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:06.284]  So, a week and a half ago, Geraldo on his own show said that he thinks 9-11 Truth has legitimate concerns and it looks like Building 7 could have been blown up.
[00:19:07.144 --> 00:19:12.446]  And then when he went on Judge Napolitano's show, uh, he basically said the same thing.
[00:19:12.486 --> 00:19:13.326]  This is a big deal.
[00:19:15.512 --> 00:19:21.937]  So, I've got a lot of problems with Geraldo Rivera over the years, but you've got to give people credit where credit is due.
[00:19:22.717 --> 00:19:23.758]  Now, people will spin that.
[00:19:23.878 --> 00:19:25.419]  Alex endorses Fox News.
[00:19:26.059 --> 00:19:32.224]  Alex endorses Geraldo Rivera, which is always a red herring, paper tiger, straw man.
[00:19:32.564 --> 00:19:34.285]  I'm just saying I'm giving credit where credit is due.
[00:19:34.585 --> 00:19:40.610]  Kind of like when Glenn Beck comes out and says the government may stage terror attacks on New Oklahoma City and blame it on the American people.
[00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.770]  That's a big deal.
[00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.231]  I mean, you have to give credit where credit is due.
[00:19:45.376 --> 00:19:50.623]  I want to get into the huge... I mean, every day it just gets bigger, as you've seen and noticed.
[00:19:51.284 --> 00:19:53.066]  Latest developments on TSA.
[00:19:53.687 --> 00:19:55.129]  They are beginning to capitulate.
[00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.492]  But, they're going to come in with a staged terror.
[00:19:57.772 --> 00:19:59.154]  But first, I want to take your phone calls.
[00:19:59.941 --> 00:20:00.661]  Still worrying?
[00:20:00.921 --> 00:20:05.403]  From GMO to organic food in jeopardy, divided by economic turmoil, there is still an answer.
[00:20:05.683 --> 00:20:09.464]  With just a little knowledge easily acquired, you will literally see food everywhere.
[00:20:09.784 --> 00:20:14.986]  Author Linda Runyon has these skills from having lived this way of life and created the tools so you could too.
[00:20:15.286 --> 00:20:19.948]  Wild food is economical, nutritious, freely available, abundant, and free for the taking.
[00:20:20.288 --> 00:20:23.590]  It is a skill that takes little time to learn, but stays with you for life.
[00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.031]  And now for a limited time, it's all on sale.
[00:20:26.271 --> 00:20:28.372]  It's called the Buy Buy Old Website Sale.
[00:20:28.632 --> 00:20:29.592]  Can you guess what's coming?
[00:20:30.053 --> 00:20:34.695]  Absolutely everything's on sale across the board, including our already discounted packages.
[00:20:35.055 --> 00:20:36.836]  And you know, the holidays are coming up fast.
[00:20:37.276 --> 00:20:39.378]  We don't know if we're going to have another sale this year.
[00:20:39.398 --> 00:20:41.640]  This was the only one in 2010 so far.
[00:20:42.121 --> 00:20:46.425]  We've been lucky to keep our prices the same since 2008, but who knows what the future will bring.
[00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:50.629]  So go to ofthefield.com now or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:53.511]  That's ofthefield.com or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and cross food off your to-do list.
[00:20:59.697 --> 00:21:02.019]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:02.099 --> 00:21:04.301]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:04.421 --> 00:21:07.183]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:07.623 --> 00:21:12.387]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:12.727 --> 00:21:16.930]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.551]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:22.112]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:22.472 --> 00:21:25.033]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:25.374 --> 00:21:32.977]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:33.311 --> 00:21:38.594]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:40.976]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:41.556 --> 00:21:44.999]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:46.179]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:46.319 --> 00:21:47.620]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.781]  Invisible Empire.

[00:21:58.703 --> 00:22:01.404]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:22:01.664 --> 00:22:05.606]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[00:22:05.806 --> 00:22:07.887]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:22:08.088 --> 00:22:13.110]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:14.991]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:22:15.051 --> 00:22:16.412]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:22:16.612 --> 00:22:18.052]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:22:18.092 --> 00:22:21.134]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:22:21.454 --> 00:22:26.500]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:35.971]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[00:22:41.337 --> 00:22:44.659]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:50.822]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.

[00:22:58.426 --> 00:22:59.226]  Pure water.

[00:24:05.104 --> 00:24:18.430]  You notice the bullies of the TSA have come out and said, we don't care what you say, what you do, just don't fly, drive a car.
[00:24:32.034 --> 00:24:34.598]  And so millions of Americans are saying, OK, we won't fly.
[00:24:35.499 --> 00:24:43.190]  And they're calling the different tourism outfits, they're calling the theme parks, the hotels, the airlines and saying, I'm not flying.
[00:24:44.073 --> 00:24:52.958]  That's the biggest thing you can do, because then industry will put pressure on the federal government that's trying to basically federalize and nationalize travel.
[00:24:53.598 --> 00:24:56.239]  The feds do want to kill our economy, that's been stated.
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.761]  They want a post-industrial world, but they want to do it slowly.
[00:25:00.121 --> 00:25:01.142]  They don't want you to notice.
[00:25:01.662 --> 00:25:03.283]  Here's the TSA capitulating.
[00:25:03.783 --> 00:25:06.565]  First, they won't grab the genitals of pilots.
[00:25:08.221 --> 00:25:25.291]  Then they wouldn't be as rough with children under 12, but the new video came out this weekend, just shot in the last few days of a five-year-old having his shirt pulled off and then having his skin rubbed by the male TSA worker, very bizarre and creepy, running his hands through his hair.
[00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:26.292]  It's over!
[00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:29.893]  Now as people focus in on what's going on, it's over.
[00:25:30.294 --> 00:25:33.675]  TSA pat down, went too far, agency chief says.
[00:25:34.635 --> 00:25:38.377]  TSA administrator says search of passengers' underwear should have never happened.
[00:25:39.618 --> 00:25:42.239]  All over the country, they stick their hands in your pants.
[00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:46.921]  We covered it three weeks ago, people couldn't believe it, but now it's been in hundreds of publications.
[00:25:48.462 --> 00:25:55.145]  They're not, at hundreds of airports, accidentally sticking their hands down in your pants and patting your genitals by accident.
[00:25:55.485 --> 00:25:56.745]  They were ordered to do that.
[00:25:56.765 --> 00:25:59.426]  Man, they are such liars at TSA.
[00:25:59.846 --> 00:26:00.447]  Here's another one.
[00:26:00.527 --> 00:26:04.728]  In shift, TSA chief says screenings to be minimally invasive.
[00:26:04.748 --> 00:26:05.989]  They'll just bring them right back.
[00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:08.930]  We gotta get rid of the TSA altogether, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:10.691 --> 00:26:16.513]  By the way, I saw it in the news today that Hezbollah is reportedly down on the border now.
[00:26:18.223 --> 00:26:25.907]  The organization out of Palestine, quote, advising the cartels.
[00:26:27.247 --> 00:26:30.329]  And I have no doubt of that going on.
[00:26:30.349 --> 00:26:31.709]  We're going to go over that report.
[00:26:31.729 --> 00:26:33.850]  But here you have a wide open southern border.
[00:26:34.231 --> 00:26:35.651]  You've got Hezbollah down there.
[00:26:37.272 --> 00:26:45.116]  But then we've got to pull the colostomy bag or the urine bag.
[00:26:45.156 --> 00:26:46.516]  I forget the scientific name.
[00:26:49.387 --> 00:26:50.047]  Urinology?
[00:26:50.067 --> 00:26:52.309]  Instead of colostomy, it's urinology bag?
[00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:53.991]  Please don't pull that off!
[00:26:54.051 --> 00:26:54.672]  That's connected!
[00:26:54.992 --> 00:26:55.212]  No!
[00:26:55.473 --> 00:26:55.713]  Yes!
[00:26:55.813 --> 00:26:56.033]  No!
[00:26:56.133 --> 00:26:56.353]  No!
[00:26:56.574 --> 00:26:59.717]  And then they just... and then it starts... the urine starts pouring out.
[00:26:59.737 --> 00:27:01.999]  I mean, I'm sorry to get graphic here, but it's mainstream news.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.442]  You don't even have a nurse touching you or a doctor.
[00:27:05.602 --> 00:27:07.404]  It's a TSA person.
[00:27:07.745 --> 00:27:08.265]  What's this?
[00:27:08.565 --> 00:27:09.927]  It's my colostomy bag.
[00:27:10.207 --> 00:27:10.888]  What that?
[00:27:11.548 --> 00:27:11.989]  Literally!
[00:27:13.171 --> 00:27:13.811]  What that?
[00:27:14.252 --> 00:27:16.813]  Guy starts jerking on the guy's colostomy bag, he punches him.
[00:27:16.833 --> 00:27:18.654]  I mean, what do you expect to do?
[00:27:19.854 --> 00:27:22.736]  What are these $10 an hour goons?
[00:27:24.917 --> 00:27:26.457]  Oh, the federal government is so sick.
[00:27:26.477 --> 00:27:28.558]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:27:28.598 --> 00:27:30.219]  I'm already getting into TSA.
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:34.001]  The good news is they're beginning to cave in.
[00:27:34.061 --> 00:27:37.363]  The bad news is they're going to strike back.
[00:27:37.443 --> 00:27:41.785]  And I'm not the only one that's been saying this the last three and a half weeks since we kicked this story off.
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:49.507]  Glenn Beck has now come out, and the video is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:27:49.908 --> 00:27:54.773]  He has now come out, and he is saying, he was actually on the Paula Tano Show.
[00:27:55.614 --> 00:27:57.817]  That's a hot show on Vox Business Network.
[00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:10.316]  He is saying that the TSA is going to use whatever event happens as a pretext to crack down on our liberties and freedoms.
[00:28:10.376 --> 00:28:11.597]  In fact, here's the exact quote.
[00:28:12.118 --> 00:28:16.541]  Oh, Beck, Obama will blame terror attack on TSA resistance.
[00:28:16.981 --> 00:28:18.702]  And so that is the rest of the story.
[00:28:18.982 --> 00:28:25.447]  But I want to go even further after we take a round or two of calls and get into the evidence of the government or elements of it.
[00:28:26.147 --> 00:28:33.350]  Staging the toner attacks and staging the German event last week that's been confirmed.
[00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:43.593]  I've talked to people on the street, they've heard about the German bomb, but none of the people I've talked to on the street know that it was retracted and that it was a US government drill.
[00:28:44.533 --> 00:28:48.955]  So see, they put it out for two days, bomb on German plane, then they retract it in the back of the paper.
[00:28:49.695 --> 00:28:51.716]  This is the tactic that's going on, this is what's
[00:28:53.004 --> 00:29:10.898]  happening on this front so we're going to be uh... discussing that coming up how the empire uh... is basically going to strike back uh... on this front but we'll go to justin matt joe dennis casey on the other side uh... then i'm going to
[00:29:12.139 --> 00:29:22.682]  Get back into what's happening with the economy and more on the TSA and how the system is going to respond to this because this is a lot bigger than just churn off making some money off naked body scanners.
[00:29:22.722 --> 00:29:31.505]  It's a lot bigger than just make work for out of work people who can't get jobs at the post office because it's getting ready to go out of business and falling apart.
[00:29:32.185 --> 00:29:33.326]  This is a lot more than that.
[00:29:33.346 --> 00:29:39.488]  This is about the federal government power-grabbing and taking over all transportation nationwide.
[00:29:40.068 --> 00:29:48.592]  So we'll look at all of this coming up, but this is a big place for the American people to show their power and for the American people to learn how much power they've really got.
[00:29:50.033 --> 00:29:50.913]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.413 --> 00:29:53.014]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.955 --> 00:29:56.616]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:09.985 --> 00:31:17.086]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:31:17.366 --> 00:31:21.947]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:31:30.919 --> 00:31:34.650]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:31:35.168 --> 00:31:41.354]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:31:41.935 --> 00:31:45.358]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:31:45.838 --> 00:31:53.166]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:31:53.266 --> 00:31:53.726]  Thank you.
[00:31:59.056 --> 00:32:03.279]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:03.599 --> 00:32:04.200]  Number 1.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.662]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:07.943 --> 00:32:08.503]  Number 2.
[00:32:08.803 --> 00:32:13.347]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:13.687 --> 00:32:14.127]  It's true.
[00:32:14.427 --> 00:32:18.991]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:19.311 --> 00:32:19.851]  Number 3.
[00:32:20.132 --> 00:32:23.414]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:23.714 --> 00:32:27.417]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:27.617 --> 00:32:28.178]  Number 4.
[00:32:28.418 --> 00:32:30.780]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.564]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:34.864 --> 00:32:35.064]  Number 5.
[00:32:35.645 --> 00:32:39.568]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:39.788 --> 00:32:44.553]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:44.833 --> 00:32:48.857]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.017 --> 00:32:50.558]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:33:08.021 --> 00:33:14.287]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:20.032 --> 00:33:21.474]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:33:21.494 --> 00:33:22.134]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:22.174 --> 00:33:23.275]  Central, we're here live.
[00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:24.957]  Back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:25.477 --> 00:33:27.499]  on your phone calls here in just a moment.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.424]  But just briefly getting back to the TSA, and I know I keep repeating this, but I want to be clear.
[00:33:33.712 --> 00:33:57.757]  For now almost a month we've been pointing out that if people start protesting this and saying no, that the TSA will try to fear monger and further intimidate you, but then they will fold like a house of cards and it will be yet another example of how the corporate globalist Borg are not invincible, are not unstoppable.
[00:33:59.358 --> 00:34:13.725]  And it's now being called, last week by mainstream news, AP, Reuters, you name it, a grassroots revolt that isn't just about the TSA, it's about people being tired of the government being involved in our lives.
[00:34:14.646 --> 00:34:16.727]  And now you've got people protesting the banks.
[00:34:17.447 --> 00:34:19.408]  And it transcends left-right.
[00:34:20.148 --> 00:34:22.890]  It transcends black-white.
[00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:26.994]  It's humans that are sick of being treated like slaves.
[00:34:27.415 --> 00:34:28.696]  And that's what scares the system.
[00:34:29.197 --> 00:34:33.783]  That's why the right-wing media has been trying to make this all about Obama and Napolitano.
[00:34:34.363 --> 00:34:41.492]  And whereas they're unsavory, jack-booted thugs, they are still just front people for the same agenda that's been growing for decades.
[00:34:42.293 --> 00:34:45.215]  And that's why the left has been trying to make it about the right wing.
[00:34:45.696 --> 00:34:55.083]  This is about the out-of-control military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about and that JFK, a Democrat, warned us about.
[00:34:56.344 --> 00:35:03.910]  And once we get past fighting with each other over labels and start talking about common sense, we've got a chance to fix this country.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:07.033]  Right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[00:35:07.513 --> 00:35:09.175]  Let's talk to Justin in Kansas.
[00:35:09.215 --> 00:35:10.516]  Justin, you're on the air.
[00:35:11.616 --> 00:35:12.476]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[00:35:12.757 --> 00:35:13.557]  Good sir, good to talk to you.
[00:35:13.577 --> 00:35:14.117]  What's on your mind?
[00:35:15.458 --> 00:35:25.524]  A couple, well one thing mainly, my girlfriend works up at the Irwin Army Hospital up at Fort Riley and she brought me home a document the other day that kind of creeped me out.
[00:35:25.624 --> 00:35:29.766]  It's from Admiral Mullen.
[00:35:30.306 --> 00:35:37.050]  It's a self-help guide to anti-terrorism and this is up on their website at the Irwin Army Hospital and basically it's a
[00:35:37.563 --> 00:35:40.746]  Well, it's a guide to anti-terrorism for the average citizen or soldier.
[00:35:42.048 --> 00:35:46.192]  Says, uh, this is designed to assist in making your family less vulnerable to terrorists.
[00:35:46.672 --> 00:35:50.977]  Goes on to say you and your family are a vital, yet vulnerable, uh, military resource.
[00:35:51.717 --> 00:35:53.239]  Uh, it just goes on and on about how
[00:35:53.871 --> 00:35:58.213]  You go to defend yourself against these invisible terrorists that we have everywhere.
[00:35:58.293 --> 00:36:04.036]  Oh yeah, it's all about this mental illness that they're just... And I've seen these federal and state training manuals.
[00:36:04.116 --> 00:36:05.597]  It's, does your neighbor wear blue jeans?
[00:36:05.657 --> 00:36:06.297]  I'm not joking.
[00:36:06.337 --> 00:36:08.778]  In Texas, the federal manual said that.
[00:36:09.098 --> 00:36:10.619]  Is it a woman with a baby carriage?
[00:36:10.959 --> 00:36:12.200]  Do they have a cell phone?
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.540]  Do they have a camera?
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.961]  Are they taking pictures?
[00:36:15.241 --> 00:36:16.762]  Do they criticize the government?
[00:36:17.262 --> 00:36:19.946]  Do they have gas tanks in their garage?
[00:36:20.507 --> 00:36:21.909]  Do they lock their desk?
[00:36:21.969 --> 00:36:33.204]  I mean this is basically they're profiling everyone but the real terrorist who's been caught doing chemical biological studies on us secretly, who has been caught
[00:36:34.113 --> 00:36:35.334]  Committing all these crimes.
[00:36:35.794 --> 00:36:42.999]  It's the government, but they never have us look at who openly is the most murderous group in history, i.e.
[00:36:43.039 --> 00:36:43.439]  governments.
[00:36:43.479 --> 00:36:48.443]  Now, slowly, give me the name of the report and the website, because I want to pull this up.
[00:36:49.624 --> 00:36:56.188]  The name of the report is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Guide 5260, a self-help guide to anti-terrorism.
[00:36:56.548 --> 00:36:57.389]  I'd say it slowly.
[00:36:57.729 --> 00:36:59.891]  Chairman of the Joint... Oh, there it is.
[00:37:00.311 --> 00:37:00.771]  It's the C...
[00:37:04.692 --> 00:37:13.499]  It's the CJCS Guide 5-2-6-0 Anti-Terrorism Personal Protection Guide, a self-help guide to anti-terrorism.
[00:37:13.519 --> 00:37:14.419]  Let's scroll down.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.162]  Tell me exactly what it goes through.
[00:37:18.202 --> 00:37:19.083]  Give us some of the highlights.
[00:37:19.703 --> 00:37:20.204]  Sure, sure.
[00:37:20.744 --> 00:37:31.973]  Well, like in the table of contents here, I mean it's telling you how to respond to chemical threats, respond to biological threats, how to isolate personal guidance, how to protect your house.
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:32.880]  I don't
[00:37:52.674 --> 00:37:55.895]  I think they're out there and that have been brainwashed into believing it's insane.
[00:37:55.975 --> 00:38:00.756]  Of course, the real threat in Kansas is tornadoes and a tree falling on your house.
[00:38:01.836 --> 00:38:05.057]  Why aren't they giving you reports on how to protect yourself from a tornado?
[00:38:05.858 --> 00:38:06.318]  Absolutely.
[00:38:06.418 --> 00:38:09.359]  At the very end of the document is a personal data section.
[00:38:09.379 --> 00:38:18.401]  It wants you to fill out, military member or DOD employee or civilian, your full name, your passport, social security number, your rank, your address, place of birth,
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.762]  At the very end, all the medical problems you may have.
[00:38:20.802 --> 00:38:25.206]  At the very end it says, attach two photographs, one full-length front view, one full-length side view.
[00:38:25.266 --> 00:38:26.887]  Attach one complete fingerprint card.
[00:38:26.907 --> 00:38:30.931]  It is also prudent to have an audio recording and a DNA sample.
[00:38:30.971 --> 00:38:32.292]  So basically it's a biometric
[00:38:33.041 --> 00:38:33.701]  You know, deal here.
[00:38:33.721 --> 00:38:35.222]  They're trying to get information on all of us.
[00:38:35.543 --> 00:38:41.346]  Well, they've admitted that's going to be the new global money is going to be your thumbprint or retina scan.
[00:38:41.966 --> 00:38:48.370]  After the private Federal Reserve system globally, the Federal Reserve is just one tentacle or one head of the hydra.
[00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:55.574]  After the private banking system sets up their world government openly, which they're now doing, they have to first then bankrupt all the other currencies.
[00:38:56.015 --> 00:39:01.098]  Then they're going to force everyone onto this cashless system and everything you do is going to be tracked and traced.
[00:39:01.738 --> 00:39:07.884]  They're already putting in huge fines for garage sales or selling cupcakes or anything.
[00:39:07.924 --> 00:39:09.606]  I mean just everything must be surveilled.
[00:39:09.626 --> 00:39:13.930]  They're turning the world into one giant prison.
[00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:16.612]  Justin, I appreciate your call and the points you've made here today.
[00:39:17.273 --> 00:39:18.794]  Let's talk to Matt in Minnesota.
[00:39:18.834 --> 00:39:19.595]  Matt, you're on the air.
[00:39:19.615 --> 00:39:20.916]  Hey Alex.
[00:39:21.297 --> 00:39:21.577]  Hey buddy.
[00:39:23.239 --> 00:39:38.112]  You know, in regards to TSA really quick, maybe your awesome InfoWars team can track down this video, but last night Whoopi Goldberg was on Huckabee talking about her book, and Huckabee is kind of talking about TSA, and he's like, hey listen, I'm concerned about this new TSA stuff.
[00:39:38.132 --> 00:39:39.393]  This is like a police state.
[00:39:39.833 --> 00:39:44.477]  And Whoopi Goldberg goes, well yeah, this is a police state, and you should love it.
[00:39:44.817 --> 00:39:49.982]  It's just sort of a funny video that I think would be interesting if you guys found and put it up on InfoWars.
[00:39:50.908 --> 00:39:53.233]  Well, I did actually see that this morning.
[00:39:53.433 --> 00:39:54.235]  The Drudge Report.
[00:39:55.678 --> 00:40:02.190]  We ought to do a blurb about all of these ditzy people like
[00:40:03.363 --> 00:40:07.726]  Oh, who's the big music star who shaved her head and went crazy?
[00:40:08.287 --> 00:40:09.007]  Britney Spears.
[00:40:09.468 --> 00:40:14.171]  Remember Britney Spears saying, I think we should just do whatever the President says and just shut up and not think?
[00:40:14.872 --> 00:40:19.275]  Well, that's like Gloria Allred saying, quote, I like being felt up.
[00:40:20.056 --> 00:40:26.300]  So she's saying, women, you should like strangers you don't know grabbing your breast.
[00:40:27.101 --> 00:40:29.423]  And they've actually got the video up on Drudge Report.
[00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:33.282]  It says, uh, I like being felt up.
[00:40:34.483 --> 00:40:40.525]  And, uh, TSA boss regrets ABC News staffer, uh, getting their underwear searched.
[00:40:40.645 --> 00:40:44.887]  So see, just a few weeks ago they tried to deny the fact that they stick their hands in your underwear.
[00:40:45.307 --> 00:40:46.928]  Now that's mainstream news.
[00:40:47.528 --> 00:40:53.391]  Uh, but we have Gloria Allred, the famous, uh, lawyer, who's always about women's rights and women not being touched.
[00:40:53.671 --> 00:40:55.171]  But then there's the larger issue.
[00:40:55.752 --> 00:40:58.413]  It's now confirmed that they're taking people's children
[00:40:59.293 --> 00:41:21.704]  uh... away from them into private areas even three four five-year-olds and strip searching them uh... and and and touching them so how do you teach your children don't let strangers touch you or don't go along with somebody you don't know and now these minimum wage weirdos that went and got the jobs to touch people's genitals
[00:41:22.564 --> 00:41:36.978]  uh... they are now taking your child away from you crying and touching their genitals just this morning i was in there on youtube watching news clips of this and my children walked in and my wife came in and said you can't watch that and we had to explain to them
[00:41:37.879 --> 00:41:38.960]  The government's bad.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:44.122]  They're wanting to put their hands down your pants just because they heard the news, you know, playing on YouTube.
[00:41:44.562 --> 00:41:49.865]  And I shouldn't have to have that discussion with my children that, yes, we've told you don't let strangers touch you.
[00:41:50.165 --> 00:41:52.106]  Don't let anybody stick their hand down your pants.
[00:41:52.166 --> 00:41:53.907]  Don't go anywhere with somebody alone.
[00:41:54.427 --> 00:41:59.189]  And now just all over the radio, all over the news, it's about the government doing this to them.
[00:41:59.429 --> 00:42:01.670]  This is so sick and out of control.
[00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:03.971]  But government knows that they can get away with this.
[00:42:04.211 --> 00:42:05.332]  They can get away with anything.
[00:42:08.336 --> 00:42:09.657]  Go ahead caller, finish up your point.
[00:42:10.438 --> 00:42:20.469]  Oh yeah, I was going to say, locally here in Minnesota, I try and call the radio shows as much as possible and I think a lot of the people are waking up to this TSA tyranny and they're standing up against it.
[00:42:20.489 --> 00:42:25.094]  You know, real quick, I had a comment regarding the Geraldo 9-11 stuff.
[00:42:25.114 --> 00:42:26.295]  I think that's pretty exciting.
[00:42:26.576 --> 00:42:28.277]  I know you've been on a Geraldo show before.
[00:42:28.918 --> 00:42:30.260]  Do you think he would
[00:42:31.193 --> 00:42:38.516]  Ever come on your show and do you think there will ever be a Alex Jones going back discussion either on his show or your show?
[00:42:38.776 --> 00:42:42.158]  I just feel like it's going to happen someday and do you ever think that that would happen?
[00:42:42.827 --> 00:42:45.149]  Well, I would obviously go on their shows if they invited me.
[00:42:45.189 --> 00:42:50.933]  I've been on Geraldo's a few times and we sat around the office talking about, is he a closet 9-11 truther?
[00:42:52.395 --> 00:42:58.139]  But I don't think Beck will probably have me on because he's taken so much of my research and the work we do.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:03.544]  He knows that parallel and that connection has been made.
[00:43:03.944 --> 00:43:08.748]  And so I don't think Beck, you know, wants to further up my visibility.
[00:43:08.768 --> 00:43:10.789]  But it doesn't matter what Glenn Beck does.
[00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:14.530]  Glenn Beck, and I'm not saying it's an audience I don't want.
[00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:15.450]  I want everybody.
[00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:17.551]  I mean, I just get up here and cover the news.
[00:43:17.571 --> 00:43:21.692]  I don't sit here and do market analysis of, you know, who we're targeting or who listens.
[00:43:22.192 --> 00:43:32.335]  It just so happens we have a very diverse audience, but we have one of the youngest audiences in talk radio, from stations that do get the ratings and look at them and from the demographics we see online.
[00:43:32.815 --> 00:43:35.136]  We have, you know, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, you know, right through 100 years old.
[00:43:40.057 --> 00:43:48.960]  But we're really strong in the young people and the 18 to 35, the most coveted demographic, and a Glenn Beck isn't.
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.782]  Glenn Beck does a lot of his big speeches at retirement homes, and that's fine.
[00:43:53.702 --> 00:43:56.343]  It's just that Glenn Beck is the past.
[00:43:56.983 --> 00:43:58.984]  This radio show is the future.
[00:44:00.105 --> 00:44:22.378]  But Glenn Beck has been forced to cover more and more hardcore issues to stay relevant, because in the past, you know, 15 years ago, the separation between the real world material, the full spectrum breakdown that I'm covering, and the shuttered, condensed spectrum that a leftist or a right winger covers, those were universes apart.
[00:44:22.938 --> 00:44:23.839]  It was a huge gulf.
[00:44:24.239 --> 00:44:31.584]  Now the membrane between mainstream media and alternative media is just very, very thin.
[00:44:31.644 --> 00:44:32.264]  It's see-through.
[00:44:32.684 --> 00:44:38.188]  And so there's an acceleration of mainstream news and media covering the information we cover here.
[00:44:38.228 --> 00:44:40.009]  I appreciate your call.
[00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.612]  But on that subject, I didn't know that my cousin
[00:44:44.741 --> 00:44:45.862]  Buckley was going to be in town.
[00:44:47.022 --> 00:44:50.645]  Buckley Hammond, who was the first guy to ever run my AXS TV show.
[00:44:50.965 --> 00:44:57.229]  For about a year and a half I did it on my own, then Buckley did it for about two years, then Mike Hanson took over for a few years after that and did a great job.
[00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:06.335]  But Buckley, going to college here in Austin when I was first starting AXS TV, he's a really smart guy and he ran the show for several years.
[00:45:06.895 --> 00:45:09.237]  He had David Icke books when I never heard of David Icke.
[00:45:09.665 --> 00:45:11.366]  When I first got on air, I hadn't heard of David Icke.
[00:45:11.626 --> 00:45:14.528]  He was the first guy to give me a David Icke book, and I was like, man, this is crazy.
[00:45:14.568 --> 00:45:17.089]  But back then, that was my view.
[00:45:17.129 --> 00:45:20.591]  It's changed some because so much crazy stuff comes out.
[00:45:20.631 --> 00:45:31.756]  But the point is, he was into this stuff at the same time I was, or even more, into reality, into questioning the limited spectrum of information that the mainstream corporate media gives us.
[00:45:32.036 --> 00:45:32.757]  But this morning,
[00:45:34.659 --> 00:45:41.548]  We were having breakfast and he just boiled it down so well, and I was kind of paraphrasing him a moment ago.
[00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:49.119]  He said, take like a Naomi Klein who writes for Rolling Stone or a Matt Taibbi.
[00:45:50.083 --> 00:46:09.682]  People like that just five or six years ago attacked the conspiracy culture, attacked people that talked about the private Federal Reserve, went after people that criticized the system, but now today they sound more and more like you, but from a little bitty narrow window they're looking through.
[00:46:10.788 --> 00:46:14.411]  With their kind of leftist, progressive template.
[00:46:14.791 --> 00:46:16.332]  They see it all through that.
[00:46:16.392 --> 00:46:18.454]  And we all look through rose-colored darklies.
[00:46:19.495 --> 00:46:30.444]  But he described my view from the beginning, from not coming from some ideological angle or some left-right system, though I'm influenced by all the thought that's out there, but more like a dragonfly.
[00:46:31.345 --> 00:46:41.381]  With hundreds of, you know, eyes, with the composite eyes, just seeing things from all these different angles, and then the problem is trying to articulate that.
[00:46:42.946 --> 00:47:00.760]  But then he went on to describe that membrane between alternative media, anybody that looks at things from a different perspective than left-right, and the establishment media, the left-right reservation, that that wall is being decimated right now.
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:05.043]  That that wall is being removed right now.
[00:47:06.885 --> 00:47:08.046]  And so that's what's happening.
[00:47:08.932 --> 00:47:25.544]  And so the system denied all of this existed so long that now that it's all coming out in the open, we've planted all these seeds and now the tyranny is almost like rain and sunshine on the seeds.
[00:47:25.944 --> 00:47:27.726]  It's making them sprout up from everywhere.
[00:47:29.246 --> 00:47:37.828]  I mean, just with the work I've done, not counting all the other great patriots out there, I've done five, six thousand radio interviews the last ten years, conservatively.
[00:47:38.768 --> 00:47:41.948]  I have done thousands of my own radio show.
[00:47:42.108 --> 00:47:43.589]  I have made twenty-plus films.
[00:47:44.149 --> 00:47:47.769]  We've been seen hundreds of millions of times in just the last few years on YouTube.
[00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:49.870]  I mean, it's an exponential.
[00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:55.231]  And if you watch something I did ten years ago, it's pertinent and seems like I said it today.
[00:47:56.325 --> 00:47:57.325]  People say, wow!
[00:47:58.266 --> 00:48:00.006]  I mean, here's a quick example, and I'm going back to your calls.
[00:48:01.466 --> 00:48:10.909]  A year before 9-11, six months before 9-11, three months before 9-11, two months before 9-11, I was saying they're prepping the public for staged terror attacks.
[00:48:11.529 --> 00:48:14.630]  They're going to bring in the military on the streets and more control.
[00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:15.731]  It's going to be done incrementally.
[00:48:15.971 --> 00:48:17.571]  Because I could see all the preparations.
[00:48:17.931 --> 00:48:19.732]  I was going to the urban warfare drills.
[00:48:20.192 --> 00:48:23.673]  I was reading the RAND Corporation documents and CFR documents that were public.
[00:48:24.741 --> 00:48:39.755]  Then, by mid-July of 2001, I was able to go on air and say specifically they're going to blame it on their asset Bin Laden.
[00:48:39.775 --> 00:48:41.597]  I knew he was former CIA on record.
[00:48:42.358 --> 00:48:43.819]  That's a fact, folks.
[00:48:43.839 --> 00:48:44.740]  We didn't know that.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:45.461]  That's on record.
[00:48:45.941 --> 00:48:46.462]  That's admitted.
[00:48:46.822 --> 00:48:47.703]  Go check it out for yourself.
[00:48:47.723 --> 00:48:48.844]  Tim Osman was his codename.
[00:48:50.174 --> 00:48:50.754]  I don't know.
[00:49:10.106 --> 00:49:11.887]  I went on air for two hours.
[00:49:11.907 --> 00:49:15.749]  I had a two-hour TV show at the time, once a week, on top of the radio show locally.
[00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:17.370]  And I went over this.
[00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:25.175]  Well, it just so happened that I would then do the show live, tape it, and then turn it back into AXS TV to air one more time as a taped show.
[00:49:25.875 --> 00:49:28.476]  At least one more time that they are charged to air it.
[00:49:29.037 --> 00:49:32.679]  It aired at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon on 9-11, two months later.
[00:49:33.359 --> 00:49:34.640]  Hundreds of phone calls.
[00:49:36.115 --> 00:49:39.218]  Most of them, you know, saying, wow, how did you, how do you already know this?
[00:49:39.338 --> 00:49:40.218]  That's an inside job.
[00:49:40.238 --> 00:49:43.601]  But some saying, how dare you say it's an inside job?
[00:49:44.021 --> 00:49:45.663]  It was a two month old show.
[00:49:45.683 --> 00:49:51.787]  I did the show before that happened.
[00:49:52.208 --> 00:49:55.690]  And, you know, my good buddy, Jimmy Vaughn, that's what finally really woke him up.
[00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:58.653]  He was already researching this information, you know, the blues legend.
[00:49:59.994 --> 00:50:02.115]  But he watched the show live when it happened.
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:07.243]  And then he remembered people talking about the re-airing of it later.
[00:50:09.024 --> 00:50:19.251]  But that's the issue, is the power that we have to accurately predict what's going to happen because we know how the globalists operate, that is massive.
[00:50:19.831 --> 00:50:21.652]  We're going to come back and try to hurry through calls.
[00:50:21.712 --> 00:50:25.214]  Joe, Dennis, Casey, Darren.

[00:52:09.133 --> 00:52:11.514]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:11.694 --> 00:52:16.978]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:52:17.378 --> 00:52:23.623]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.

[00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:43.993]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:44.433 --> 00:52:47.574]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:47.975 --> 00:52:49.415]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:49.956 --> 00:52:50.376]  It's here.

[00:52:58.868 --> 00:53:03.111]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:53:03.431 --> 00:53:04.032]  Number one.
[00:53:04.332 --> 00:53:07.494]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:53:07.755 --> 00:53:08.335]  Number two.
[00:53:08.615 --> 00:53:13.179]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:53:13.519 --> 00:53:13.959]  It's true.
[00:53:14.259 --> 00:53:18.823]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:53:19.123 --> 00:53:19.683]  Number three.
[00:53:19.964 --> 00:53:23.246]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:53:23.546 --> 00:53:27.249]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:53:27.449 --> 00:53:27.989]  Number 4.
[00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:30.611]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:53:30.992 --> 00:53:34.374]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:53:34.675 --> 00:53:34.895]  Number 5.
[00:53:35.475 --> 00:53:39.378]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:53:39.618 --> 00:53:44.382]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:53:44.662 --> 00:53:48.685]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:53:48.825 --> 00:53:50.406]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:53:50.626 --> 00:53:52.708]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:53:52.868 --> 00:53:55.230]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:54:17.372 --> 00:54:19.493]  Well, Drudge Report just updated.
[00:54:19.513 --> 00:54:31.536]  I gave Nemo the assignment because the TSA has announced they want checkpoints on the trains and subways next.
[00:54:31.556 --> 00:54:32.856]  They've already been beta testing it.
[00:54:33.596 --> 00:54:38.898]  And Kurt Nemo today did an article on it and it's red-linked on Drudge Report.
[00:54:39.838 --> 00:54:43.599]  TSA searches are trains and subways next.
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:50.305]  And it goes on to go over the facts.
[00:54:51.346 --> 00:54:54.169]  So good job, Nemo, on that story.
[00:54:55.611 --> 00:55:01.136]  The next story we need... Well, we're gonna get that report done.
[00:55:01.556 --> 00:55:03.759]  There's another key angle that needs to be covered.
[00:55:04.159 --> 00:55:07.542]  Okay, let's go back to your phone calls here.
[00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:14.273]  And again, I could care less about being linked on the biggest website in the world if my story was about O.J.
[00:55:14.313 --> 00:55:15.054]  Simpson or something.
[00:55:15.414 --> 00:55:17.315]  I care because this is a real issue.
[00:55:17.735 --> 00:55:21.317]  If they get away with putting their hands down our pants, they can get away with anything.
[00:55:22.498 --> 00:55:23.558]  It's very, very simple.
[00:55:24.379 --> 00:55:26.420]  And I'm glad that people are hopping mad about this.
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.381]  Let's talk to Joe in Pennsylvania.
[00:55:28.421 --> 00:55:29.242]  Joe, you're on the air.
[00:55:30.342 --> 00:55:31.203]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:55:31.463 --> 00:55:31.723]  Good.
[00:55:32.884 --> 00:55:36.726]  I got a TSA story and then a suggestion if it's okay.
[00:55:38.156 --> 00:55:38.956]  If I have enough time.
[00:55:38.976 --> 00:55:46.922]  I went on vacation back in September and I didn't really think too much about the whole humiliation thing, the way they pat you down.
[00:55:47.442 --> 00:55:48.343]  I wasn't thinking about it.
[00:55:50.064 --> 00:55:53.947]  I'm in a wheelchair and the guy's feeling me up.
[00:55:53.967 --> 00:55:58.190]  He's got my arms stretched out and he's doing the whole breast feel and everything like that.
[00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:01.792]  He got all done and stuff and I'm like, is that it?
[00:56:02.573 --> 00:56:04.054]  He looked at me like, yeah.
[00:56:05.859 --> 00:56:08.987]  Aren't you gonna check underneath my seat there?
[00:56:09.027 --> 00:56:10.651]  I could have some plastic down there too.
[00:56:10.711 --> 00:56:11.894]  I was being sarcastic with him.
[00:56:12.743 --> 00:56:14.044]  Uh, from Plastique down there.
[00:56:14.064 --> 00:56:16.244]  Aren't you going to look underneath my foot pedals?
[00:56:16.765 --> 00:56:19.146]  And he kind of looked at me like with his dumbfounded look.
[00:56:19.786 --> 00:56:20.966]  Like, uh... Yeah, no, no, no.
[00:56:21.026 --> 00:56:23.167]  They don't check where bombs could really be.
[00:56:23.187 --> 00:56:26.869]  Look, the number one threat has always been in the cargo.
[00:56:27.269 --> 00:56:28.749]  Almost none of that gets checked.
[00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:31.351]  Look, it's all about training us.
[00:56:31.411 --> 00:56:36.152]  Now, again, the average TSA worker doesn't know that because they don't know how to tie their shoelaces on average.
[00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:39.834]  I mean, who else could they get to do this humiliating job all day?
[00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:44.312]  He looked at you like he's usually the big bubba type, you know what I mean?
[00:56:44.552 --> 00:56:45.572]  Yeah, I know, I know what you mean.
[00:56:46.353 --> 00:56:56.358]  But my other suggestion, I was listening to Max Keiser last week with you guys, and you know, everybody buy a silver dollar, and I was trying to think of a way it could be coordinated.
[00:56:57.038 --> 00:57:08.284]  I don't know anything about setting up websites or anything, but you have a vast array of different radio show hosts and people that you know, and we all subscribe, you know, we subscribe to your websites and stuff.
[00:57:08.806 --> 00:57:17.073]  What would you think about putting up a petition where your listeners that pay and subscribe
[00:57:17.611 --> 00:57:24.134]  Made a commitment, like on a certain day, like on the 11th of December, to buy that silver dollar.
[00:57:24.535 --> 00:57:31.218]  And you just, through all of your radio shows, that their listeners would all commit to do that same thing.
[00:57:31.258 --> 00:57:33.179]  Now Joe, and Joe, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[00:57:33.479 --> 00:57:34.660]  This show is powerful.
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.281]  But it's not that powerful.
[00:57:36.841 --> 00:57:42.564]  Our power is to get a pebble rolling downhill that causes a rock slide.
[00:57:43.908 --> 00:57:46.530]  We are able to trigger chain reactions.
[00:57:47.111 --> 00:57:50.673]  Even mainline corporate media has trouble setting the agenda now.
[00:57:51.114 --> 00:57:55.717]  We've gotten to the point where even the big mega-dinosaur media can't set a lot of the agendas.
[00:57:56.278 --> 00:58:02.783]  It's the alternative media and all those voices in a fight with the corporate media now for the heart and soul of society.
[00:58:04.423 --> 00:58:16.438]  It's the idea of everybody buying silver and knowing that by buying silver in an uncoordinated way, that that will force the hand of the big banks.
[00:58:17.571 --> 00:58:19.212]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.840]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.981 --> 00:58:54.622]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:55.002 --> 00:58:58.002]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:58.242 --> 00:59:03.023]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:03.043 --> 00:59:09.264]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:09.425 --> 00:59:11.665]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:12.205 --> 00:59:12.485]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:12.505 --> 00:59:12.925]  Bernanke?
[00:59:13.025 --> 00:59:13.626]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:13.686 --> 00:59:14.726]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:14.786 --> 00:59:17.208]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:31.095 --> 00:59:32.956]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:38.058]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:38.378 --> 00:59:48.303]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:52.725 --> 00:59:54.665]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.106 --> 00:59:57.847]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:08.718]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.379 --> 01:00:10.180]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:11.841]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.522 --> 01:00:16.146]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.706 --> 01:00:20.770]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.165 --> 01:00:37.338]  We are now into our number two, Joel Skousen, always extremely important of World Affairs Brief, will be joining us on a host of issues and breaking information dealing with government-sponsored terror that ties into what we see happening with the TSA and more.
[01:00:37.778 --> 01:00:39.880]  But right now, let's keep hammering through those calls.
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.522]  Casey in Indiana, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:00:43.463 --> 01:00:44.443]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:00:44.603 --> 01:00:44.884]  Good.
[01:00:46.205 --> 01:00:49.948]  I've got some information and a question about the FEMA camps.
[01:00:50.861 --> 01:00:59.326]  I live in central Indiana near Grissom Air Force Base, which has been shut down for a long time and is on the list of FEMA detention centers.
[01:01:00.006 --> 01:01:14.773]  But tomorrow, President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will be visiting Kokomo, Indiana, a few miles from Grissom, to unveil a new solar panel facility and discuss a town saved by the stimulus since Chrysler and GM have factories there.
[01:01:15.594 --> 01:01:17.815]  But I have friends that work for a construction company
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:21.403]  Uh, they've recently been working on a project at Grissom.
[01:01:21.944 --> 01:01:23.605]  Uh, they're building some new buildings and stuff.
[01:01:24.066 --> 01:01:28.250]  And, uh, they were told no work tomorrow because Obama will be at the Air Force Base.
[01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:36.318]  And, uh, I didn't know if you had any information if there's a correlation, uh, with the President's, uh, appearances in these FEMA locations, like if he's inspecting them.
[01:01:37.577 --> 01:01:49.449]  Well, that would be speculation, but the Emergency Centers Act is so key to read the entire bill because it's a blueprint for what they've already built and designed.
[01:01:49.989 --> 01:01:51.791]  It's just an attempt to get it more funding.
[01:01:51.911 --> 01:01:53.332]  Six mega-regional
[01:01:54.534 --> 01:01:54.614]  I'm
[01:02:12.837 --> 01:02:23.359]  And it's everything that we had reverse-engineered from studying the camps, from studying Rex 84, and the fragments of declassified evidence we had previously.
[01:02:23.379 --> 01:02:31.041]  It was a total vindication to tell us, you were absolutely right, that is researchers, on what they put together.
[01:02:32.361 --> 01:02:37.582]  But basically, a lot of the stimulus money is going into the old bases.
[01:02:38.402 --> 01:02:41.263]  They proposed in the 80s, under the COG,
[01:02:42.877 --> 01:03:11.395]  uh... cognitive government to make the old bases government emergency centers and to quote bring in local law enforcement merge them in under federal control now bush senior uh... began that clinton accelerated it and so the rumors came out by the workers and others that were inside under bush it it went public in houston chronicle uh... wall street journal reported on them being camps for citizens uh... they also use them as a cover story for foreigners
[01:03:12.556 --> 01:03:21.048]  You've got Corrections Corporation of America on record last year and this year lobbying to build more camps, quote, for the illegals, but they're really for citizens.
[01:03:22.369 --> 01:03:23.771]  So it's very, very serious.
[01:03:25.033 --> 01:03:27.937]  And so we know that they're accelerating this program, Casey.
[01:03:29.451 --> 01:03:36.374]  Yeah, I just didn't know if you had any information about it because it wasn't disclosed to the public that he's going to be at the Air Force Base.
[01:03:36.394 --> 01:03:49.681]  He's only supposed to be talking at this solar panel facility and the only reason I have the information about him being at the base is that my friends work for the construction company that are laying the gas lines and everything at these new buildings on the detention center.
[01:03:49.901 --> 01:03:57.306]  Yeah, well, that's how they do it, is a lot of times they don't announce exactly where the president's going to be.
[01:03:58.266 --> 01:04:07.232]  So in case there is some lone nut or something, and believe it, there are those out there as well, that they don't know how to find him or know where he's going to be at.
[01:04:07.612 --> 01:04:13.396]  But again, that's also part of all this elaborate protection they give POTUS, Puppet-in-Chief,
[01:04:13.996 --> 01:04:20.818]  to create the illusion that he's actually running things so they can scapegoat presidents down the road.
[01:04:21.478 --> 01:04:24.419]  That's why they built a mile-long bulletproof tunnel in India.
[01:04:24.779 --> 01:04:29.100]  That's why they pulled all the coconuts down in Mumbai so one wouldn't hit him in the head.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:31.101]  All this ridiculous
[01:04:32.628 --> 01:04:38.553]  Pageantry and hype so that we never look at the Federal Reserve and the real ruling class.
[01:04:38.593 --> 01:04:39.453]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:39.473 --> 01:04:40.254]  Great points, Casey.
[01:04:41.034 --> 01:04:45.458]  Julio, Darren, Marcy, James, your call's coming up.
[01:04:45.478 --> 01:04:45.878]  800-259-9231.
[01:04:46.158 --> 01:04:49.561]  I'm going to try to hurry through them.
[01:04:49.621 --> 01:04:52.963]  We've been doing a little bit better job, but I'm going to try to go even faster on the other side.
[01:04:53.043 --> 01:04:53.764]  Love the different angles.
[01:04:53.884 --> 01:04:54.905]  The callers take us in.
[01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:57.126]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:57.147 --> 01:04:57.527]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.616 --> 01:05:05.257]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:05.577 --> 01:05:13.718]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:14.438 --> 01:05:18.479]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:19.059 --> 01:05:29.881]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:30.521 --> 01:05:39.524]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:40.044 --> 01:05:45.086]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[01:06:03.766 --> 01:06:04.687]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:05.027 --> 01:06:08.551]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:08.571 --> 01:06:11.194]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:11.214 --> 01:06:16.660]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:23.307]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:23.727 --> 01:06:29.271]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:29.671 --> 01:06:33.354]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:33.894 --> 01:06:37.877]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:38.177 --> 01:06:43.701]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:44.122 --> 01:06:47.084]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:47.684 --> 01:06:49.105]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:49.645 --> 01:06:50.086]  It's here.

[01:07:06.154 --> 01:07:09.715]  He's also told you that eFoodsDirect has the best food on the planet.
[01:07:09.816 --> 01:07:11.116]  Well, here's the great news.
[01:07:11.536 --> 01:07:14.658]  It's that time of year and their holiday special is here.
[01:07:14.878 --> 01:07:15.318]  I think so.
[01:07:38.217 --> 01:07:38.637]  I think so.
[01:08:01.232 --> 01:08:07.243]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:07.864 --> 01:08:10.850]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:21.288 --> 01:08:23.910]  Alright, we're going back to your phone calls, then into the economy.
[01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:29.933]  The big developments on the TSA full-scale revolt against tyranny as they begin to cave in.
[01:08:30.374 --> 01:08:35.917]  Major cracks in the facade have now turned into giant gaping holes in their fraud.
[01:08:36.277 --> 01:08:38.979]  They do and have been putting TSA on the streets.
[01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:42.722]  I want to get into their master plan on that front.
[01:08:43.581 --> 01:08:44.902]  And I want to continue with your phone calls.
[01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:59.010]  I first, though, wanted to remind listeners that just because you're awake, just because you know more about the New World Order than I do on many fronts, I'm always amazed by the emails and comments and letters I'm sent.
[01:08:59.910 --> 01:09:02.472]  And the astute understanding that people have.
[01:09:02.512 --> 01:09:05.594]  We're all working together, becoming more knowledgeable.
[01:09:06.155 --> 01:09:09.777]  The general public is awake now to a certain extent.
[01:09:10.197 --> 01:09:12.179]  That's a big part of the equation.
[01:09:12.559 --> 01:09:15.041]  But they don't know exactly what's going on.
[01:09:16.362 --> 01:09:18.723]  Now is the time to reach out to the public.
[01:09:19.164 --> 01:09:25.048]  Now is the time to give them high-quality, well-produced documentary films.
[01:09:25.568 --> 01:09:28.951]  And when you give them a film with a professionally done cover,
[01:09:30.111 --> 01:09:33.592]  Shrink-wrapped, that's got a brief description on the back.
[01:09:34.073 --> 01:09:40.255]  They are more apt to watch it, and that is someone's mind that you are literally unlocking.
[01:09:40.935 --> 01:09:45.317]  Now, we have a special going right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:45.397 --> 01:09:46.777]  It's only going through Christmas.
[01:09:47.198 --> 01:09:49.118]  It's the Essential Alex Jones.
[01:09:49.979 --> 01:09:55.641]  It is my five newest and most powerful films for $24.95 apiece.
[01:09:59.465 --> 01:10:02.287]  Twenty-four, ninety-five apiece.
[01:10:03.969 --> 01:10:06.070]  That is less than five dollars apiece.
[01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:07.531]  The Obama deception.
[01:10:08.092 --> 01:10:08.652]  Endgame.
[01:10:09.072 --> 01:10:10.033]  Terror Storm.
[01:10:10.494 --> 01:10:11.554]  Fall of the Republic.
[01:10:11.935 --> 01:10:12.615]  Police State 4.
[01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:14.517]  The Rise of FEMA.
[01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:18.300]  And even if you already have one or more of these films, get them.
[01:10:19.198 --> 01:10:20.759]  Give them to your friends and family.
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:26.083]  I don't care if they're a Muslim or a Jew and don't practice Christmas.
[01:10:26.643 --> 01:10:28.565]  Say Happy Hanukkah or whatever.
[01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:31.387]  Just give them the material if they're an atheist.
[01:10:32.467 --> 01:10:32.928]  So what?
[01:10:33.008 --> 01:10:33.848]  They love Christmas.
[01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:39.532]  The point is that we need to wake people up here.
[01:10:40.053 --> 01:10:41.374]  And we've got a bunch of other specials.
[01:10:41.414 --> 01:10:45.276]  You can get one copy of any title and get three more titles free.
[01:10:46.137 --> 01:10:46.998]  That's with all of our
[01:10:47.498 --> 01:10:48.138]  Top films.
[01:10:48.158 --> 01:10:49.859]  We're not discounting our old films.
[01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:54.361]  We're discounting our newest, most powerful films at InfoWars.com.
[01:10:54.882 --> 01:11:03.766]  And until Christmas, we're also running a special we do every year in the middle of November into December, five months free at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:06.167]  You get 5.3 months free.
[01:11:06.187 --> 01:11:07.268]  That's what the special comes out to.
[01:11:07.288 --> 01:11:08.708]  You pay for 6.7 months.
[01:11:09.068 --> 01:11:13.070]  You get 5.3 months free with a yearly membership at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:11:14.671 --> 01:11:18.194]  Or you can get a trial membership for a month, $5.95.
[01:11:18.894 --> 01:11:21.236]  My book, Paul Watson's book, Expanded Extras.
[01:11:21.656 --> 01:11:29.061]  We've had a new Jesse Ventura video interview, a new Willie Nelson, all of the... Katherine Austin Fitch, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[01:11:29.562 --> 01:11:32.304]  I mean, look at new interviews every day or two.
[01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:35.607]  Going up, in fact, we had these ready last week.
[01:11:35.848 --> 01:11:36.908]  They're going up in the next few days.
[01:11:36.928 --> 01:11:37.829]  They're on the server now.
[01:11:38.329 --> 01:11:39.830]  We've got Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:45.953]  We've got a whole bunch of other never-before-seen interviews, sit-down video, professional interviews.

[01:12:23.294 --> 01:12:27.636]  And I want to thank all of you for your support over the years.
[01:12:27.937 --> 01:12:29.197]  We couldn't have done it without you.
[01:12:29.517 --> 01:12:34.640]  And this information wouldn't be all over the place and literally on fire if it wasn't for you.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.321]  We are the spearhead.
[01:12:36.741 --> 01:12:38.742]  We together are the tip of the spear.
[01:12:39.062 --> 01:12:40.483]  Let's go to Julio in Illinois.
[01:12:40.503 --> 01:12:41.503]  Julio, thanks for holding.
[01:12:42.724 --> 01:12:46.966]  Alex Jones, happy early Thanksgiving to you and all the freedom lovers worldwide.
[01:12:47.466 --> 01:13:02.593]  Around last year during Christmas, listening to you talking about the Christmas Day CIA bombing, fake bombing that took place, I knew then and there that 2010 was going to be a pivotal year in the info war, and it turned out to be exactly that.
[01:13:02.613 --> 01:13:04.194]  For everyone who
[01:13:04.949 --> 01:13:06.852]  Who is awake with this whole TSA thing?
[01:13:07.533 --> 01:13:11.819]  Show your friends who have been molested by these pigs at TSA.
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:14.082]  Show them Police State 4, Rise of FEMA.
[01:13:14.142 --> 01:13:19.971]  I mean, that film pretty much lays the groundwork for what's currently going on and what's going to happen next.
[01:13:20.211 --> 01:13:24.352]  It covers the full history, the current operations, and the future spectrum.
[01:13:24.672 --> 01:13:29.134]  If somebody sees Police State 4, they will have a master's degree in the police state.
[01:13:29.414 --> 01:13:30.934]  I mean, cops should see this.
[01:13:31.234 --> 01:13:34.255]  And when cops do see it, they freak out because they know it's all accurate.
[01:13:34.535 --> 01:13:36.376]  They had never just put all the pieces together.
[01:13:37.791 --> 01:13:51.518]  Secondly, in terms of Jay Rockefeller, the scum in West Virginia, talking about the little bug inside of him, maybe it's his RFID chip or maybe it's the devil, I don't know, talking about trying to get rid of Fox and MSNBC.
[01:13:52.039 --> 01:13:59.743]  People need to look up Electronic Media Law by Roger Sadler to understand the rules of what the FCC actually can and can't do.
[01:14:00.203 --> 01:14:08.992]  The FTC has no regulation over cable, satellite systems, they have no regulation over satellite... No, they're just announcing that they have the regulation over it.
[01:14:09.232 --> 01:14:13.156]  Just like TSA is announcing they can stick your hand down your pants, they can't.
[01:14:13.217 --> 01:14:20.464]  This is brazen tyranny, just wading into the middle of things and openly, you know, calling for censoring the web.
[01:14:20.704 --> 01:14:23.127]  They're doing this because they are in deep trouble.
[01:14:24.161 --> 01:14:25.582]  I think we're all ignorant.
[01:14:25.622 --> 01:14:27.844]  And one last thing, someone called earlier about FEMA camps.
[01:14:28.245 --> 01:14:45.661]  If people can look up the Cancun Climate Conference coming up in Cancun, Mexico on the 29th, it talks about, in that website, in one of their documents, Mexico is getting set to relocate their citizens in high concentrated greenhouse pollutant areas to a special camp.
[01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:48.582]  And people, it's in their website, people, just Google.
[01:14:48.822 --> 01:15:06.110]  Well, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, that's why I love taking calls, because I saw that two weeks ago, I looked at the... I saw it two weeks ago on their website, my mouth dropped, I showed my roommate this, and I'm like, this is how they're gonna... No, no, no, I gotta stop you, I gotta stop you right now, Julio.
[01:15:07.165 --> 01:15:08.826]  This is my biggest frustration.
[01:15:08.846 --> 01:15:10.086]  This is my biggest problem.
[01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:14.248]  And I literally just got chills when Julio said that.
[01:15:15.028 --> 01:15:17.969]  And then after the chills, I had like a hot flash of anger.
[01:15:17.989 --> 01:15:22.131]  And literally began sweating the minute he said that.
[01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:23.231]  And I just got chills again.
[01:15:23.251 --> 01:15:24.832]  I just got chills again.
[01:15:25.717 --> 01:15:26.718]  I just got chills again.
[01:15:27.478 --> 01:15:28.699]  You know why I'm getting chills?
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:34.084]  Because my gut is telling me, Alex, you aren't professional.
[01:15:34.544 --> 01:15:35.945]  You suck.
[01:15:36.946 --> 01:15:39.108]  Alex, you've got to go to the next level.
[01:15:39.508 --> 01:15:41.109]  You've got to get yourself together.
[01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:43.751]  You were sent that by listeners two weeks ago.
[01:15:44.632 --> 01:15:46.133]  You confirmed it was real.
[01:15:47.074 --> 01:15:48.936]  It tied into Agenda 21.
[01:15:49.856 --> 01:15:53.599]  It tied into everything and was another key confirmation
[01:15:54.776 --> 01:16:12.744]  Matrix point that confirmed hundreds of other data points, and I printed it at home, didn't bring it, didn't cover it, and then it makes me angry to think of how many other things I'm aware of and I don't cover, and then literally my mind explodes into fractal
[01:16:13.804 --> 01:16:14.144]  I don't
[01:16:34.392 --> 01:16:56.552]  And this Green Tyranny that Club of Rome talks about merging with the quote, anti-terror system that they wrote about in 1991, and I meant to give that to Watson, so let me stop you, Julio, because again, I saw it, I printed it out, give me, but now I forget the name of it, give me the website, the name of the paper, and where it is, we'll pull it up right now.
[01:16:57.489 --> 01:16:58.069]  Oh, I see.
[01:16:58.249 --> 01:16:58.770]  That's the problem.
[01:16:58.810 --> 01:17:02.572]  I'm currently driving right now, and I don't have a computer.
[01:17:02.712 --> 01:17:06.874]  But Alex, if you just Google, it's right on the UN Cancun website.
[01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:08.575]  It's underneath the Documents tab.
[01:17:09.575 --> 01:17:13.197]  I apologize for this, but it's on their own website.
[01:17:13.257 --> 01:17:14.358]  No, it's not you!
[01:17:14.378 --> 01:17:16.419]  I'm not growling because of you!
[01:17:17.279 --> 01:17:46.414]  Julio, whenever I, I constantly see hardcore stuff and I'm so overwhelmed that then I don't even, and just while you did this, while you spurred my memory, I've had like 10 or 15 other things pop up in my head to the point of I just want to smash the microphone, tomp the desk over, and run screaming down the street if people knew how hardcore it is, how much worse it is than we can tell you, how fast they're moving, world government openly, and I can't handle it all anymore!
[01:17:47.114 --> 01:17:47.855]  I'm sick of it!
[01:17:48.115 --> 01:17:49.236]  I'm tired of the globalists!
[01:17:49.256 --> 01:17:50.116]  They're so evil!
[01:17:50.136 --> 01:18:09.011]  I mean, Julio, they admittedly murder our troops and chemical weapons test, release biological weapons on the New York subway, radiate foster children, murder people, inject children with syphilis, they get caught, and we still sit here and trust the government and have debates about did they stage the terror attacks or not?
[01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:11.233]  Of course they staged the terror attacks!
[01:18:11.273 --> 01:18:11.673]  Now listen,
[01:18:13.197 --> 01:18:14.898]  What section was this under?
[01:18:16.399 --> 01:18:18.960]  So I guess we just pull up the UN subsection.
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.701]  But a lot of times they create a whole new URL.
[01:18:21.821 --> 01:18:23.162]  Is it the Cancun meeting?
[01:18:23.202 --> 01:18:23.802]  What's it called?
[01:18:25.883 --> 01:18:28.565]  You've got to Google UN Cancun conference.
[01:18:28.645 --> 01:18:31.006]  It's like the first or second link on Google.
[01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:32.567]  It takes you to the exact website.
[01:18:32.587 --> 01:18:33.207]  I know, I've seen it.
[01:18:33.227 --> 01:18:34.107]  That's my frustration.
[01:18:34.127 --> 01:18:36.889]  Okay, UN, as soon as I settle down I'll be able to remember.
[01:18:42.717 --> 01:18:46.941]  UN Climate Conference, and then think back.
[01:18:46.981 --> 01:18:52.326]  We'll need to then search the term on the site, sustainability, communities, Mexico, is that it?
[01:18:53.247 --> 01:18:56.090]  Yeah, it talks about, it's like, it says Mexico leading the way.
[01:18:57.951 --> 01:18:59.433]  It's under the documents tab.
[01:19:00.071 --> 01:19:01.451]  Okay, Mexico leading the way.
[01:19:01.491 --> 01:19:03.492]  But you're a longtime listener, Julio.
[01:19:03.512 --> 01:19:04.472]  You've been calling for years.
[01:19:04.892 --> 01:19:09.153]  Do you remember the stories I told of when I was 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 years old?
[01:19:09.394 --> 01:19:17.296]  Every year, my parents' favorite holiday destination, because it was only two hours away from Austin via plane, was Cancun.
[01:19:17.716 --> 01:19:23.457]  We'd fly in, we'd stay one day at a hotel, then we'd get in the car and we'd drive to cenotes, ruins.
[01:19:23.877 --> 01:19:25.678]  We'd drive way down into southern Mexico.
[01:19:26.138 --> 01:19:28.921]  Where the Mexicans actually stay when they're on vacation.
[01:19:29.201 --> 01:19:31.023]  Ten times more beautiful than Cancun.
[01:19:31.724 --> 01:19:33.686]  And I would see all these little U.N.
[01:19:33.766 --> 01:19:34.767]  signs everywhere.
[01:19:34.787 --> 01:19:36.329]  I'll tell folks when we come back.
[01:19:36.389 --> 01:19:37.370]  Great job, Julio.
[01:19:37.810 --> 01:19:38.992]  Spurring my memory on that.
[01:19:40.512 --> 01:19:41.774]  Anyways, the U.N.
[01:19:42.394 --> 01:19:49.022]  kicked almost all the poor Mexicans who own their own land, who'd been there for thousands of years, off their own property.
[01:19:49.282 --> 01:19:49.863]  The U.N.
[01:19:49.903 --> 01:19:54.068]  did this, and then forced them up to Mexico City, and that was part of a U.N.
[01:19:54.108 --> 01:19:54.548]  program.
[01:19:54.809 --> 01:19:55.910]  So yes, the U.N.
[01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:58.072]  now is going to do the same thing again in Mexico.
[01:19:58.293 --> 01:19:58.974]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:00.475 --> 01:20:04.217]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:22:29.621 --> 01:22:34.004]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:34.184 --> 01:22:39.888]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[01:24:12.721 --> 01:24:14.602]  Okay, I'm going to give you some key data points.
[01:24:14.622 --> 01:24:17.904]  I want the help of the Prison Planet Forum.
[01:24:42.506 --> 01:24:44.767]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com, click the link that says Forum.
[01:24:45.227 --> 01:24:46.427]  Great researchers in there.
[01:24:46.908 --> 01:24:59.112]  I ran around during the break like a chicken with my head cut off and couldn't find the statements I found two weeks ago on the official UN Cancun, Mexico climate change summit kicking off the 29th.
[01:24:59.452 --> 01:25:00.553]  But Julio is right.
[01:25:01.773 --> 01:25:11.497]  It said that in carbon dense areas that they're going to forcibly move people to development zones in quote new green communities they're going to build.
[01:25:12.426 --> 01:25:13.487]  Now, I'll give you a data point.
[01:25:14.368 --> 01:25:34.123]  If you go back, this is total control over every facet of your life, to National Geographic issue in 98 or 99, and it showed UN biosphere zones in areas of Asia with armed guards, and it said they kill people caught foraging in the forest for food.
[01:25:34.464 --> 01:25:40.508]  They're there with machine guns, and it just said in the article, I remember covering it on air, that they just kill you.
[01:25:41.451 --> 01:25:43.391]  And it's like, oh, how liberal, save the earth.
[01:25:43.891 --> 01:25:47.872]  No, it's about taking land away from people and totally controlling society.
[01:25:48.612 --> 01:26:02.875]  So we need to find that section that I saw two weeks ago that somebody sent me, and I clicked through and read it and meant to cover it and now don't know where it's at, where they talk about forcefully relocating people in Mexico to other areas of the country.
[01:26:03.995 --> 01:26:06.355]  Now, that's how camps operate.
[01:26:06.855 --> 01:26:08.136]  That's how they first announced them.
[01:26:08.516 --> 01:26:10.156]  And Mexico has a history of this.
[01:26:11.368 --> 01:26:12.270]  Uh, back in 1987, 88, 89, 90.
[01:26:18.939 --> 01:26:39.752]  Back in 85, back when I was, you know, 10, 11, 12, 13 years old, we would go down to Mexico, and I'd see these UN biosphere signs, and the locals would be complaining that, you know, they'd been living on the land for thousands of years, they didn't have a deed to the property, they'd been growing corn there, you know, as far back as they could remember, and the government would pay them a pittance, kick them off the property, and make them go to Mexico City.
[01:26:40.312 --> 01:26:47.037]  That's why Mexico City's gone from a few million decades ago to over 30 million today, in the metro area and surrounding areas.
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:50.421]  Because the UN has forced them up there.
[01:26:51.142 --> 01:26:57.046]  And they take that property and sell it then to multinational corporations and to rich Mexicans.
[01:26:57.666 --> 01:27:05.111]  It was only a few years ago they began allowing Westerners to buy land in limited areas where nobody else wanted it, like the Baja.
[01:27:05.771 --> 01:27:09.432]  But most areas, you can't really get clear title to property in Mexico.
[01:27:10.112 --> 01:27:13.973]  So this is what JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs are doing.
[01:27:14.573 --> 01:27:16.494]  They've engineered the collapse of Mexico.
[01:27:16.614 --> 01:27:19.094]  Mexico has more billionaires per capita than even the U.S.
[01:27:19.274 --> 01:27:21.635]  They have one of the poorest populations under them.
[01:27:22.115 --> 01:27:23.175]  This is the model.
[01:27:23.656 --> 01:27:28.897]  And what you see happening in Mexico is more advanced than what the environmental tyranny is doing here.
[01:27:30.171 --> 01:27:31.873]  So I want to go over that.
[01:27:32.293 --> 01:27:37.619]  There's an article that deals with just the full spectrum dominance from Economic Collapse blog.
[01:27:37.639 --> 01:27:39.300]  It's also on InfoWars.com.
[01:27:39.341 --> 01:27:47.549]  Full spectrum dominance, eight examples of how the government is attempting to take control of our food, our health, our money, and even our dignity.
[01:27:48.090 --> 01:27:48.630]  Number one,
[01:27:49.671 --> 01:27:53.652]  Taking control of our food, S-510, the Food Safety Modernization Act.
[01:27:53.672 --> 01:27:55.753]  I'm going to read over more of this later after I take calls.
[01:27:56.373 --> 01:28:02.735]  Number two, taking control over air travel, the dehumanizing full body scans and enhanced pat-downs.
[01:28:03.195 --> 01:28:07.056]  Kind of like enhanced interrogation is torture, these are enhanced molestations.
[01:28:08.196 --> 01:28:13.958]  Whenever I continues with these different
[01:28:15.165 --> 01:28:16.165]  With these different points.
[01:28:17.166 --> 01:28:22.788]  Number three, taking control, total control over our health care, the loss of our health freedom.
[01:28:23.168 --> 01:28:29.931]  Number four, taking control over our money by multiplying all of the new different taxes they put in place.
[01:28:30.251 --> 01:28:37.533]  Number five, taking control of our businesses, thousands of ridiculous new regulations meant to strangle small businesses.
[01:28:37.894 --> 01:28:41.295]  Number six, taking control of our environment, the Green Police.
[01:28:43.424 --> 01:28:47.067]  Number seven, taking away our independence, the exploding welfare state.
[01:28:47.327 --> 01:28:49.249]  Number eight, taking away our patriotism.
[01:28:49.549 --> 01:28:52.191]  We're even losing the freedom to be proud of America.
[01:28:54.733 --> 01:28:59.637]  That's what we are dealing with here on this front.
[01:28:59.998 --> 01:29:05.082]  This is what these control freaks are doing to our society.
[01:29:06.803 --> 01:29:11.307]  But again, we need to create a new tab up on the Prison Planet Forum
[01:29:12.997 --> 01:29:18.035]  and you know we'll call it uh... mexico uh... carbon tax summit
[01:29:19.133 --> 01:29:23.495]  And help dig that out for me, folks, because I can't do it while I'm on air.
[01:29:23.515 --> 01:29:34.561]  We're going to come back, quickly go to calls, and I want to get into the latest developments on TSA and how they're going to counter-strike, how they're going to come back at us on the other side of this quick break.
[01:29:34.621 --> 01:29:35.862]  And Joel Skousen's coming up.
[01:29:36.102 --> 01:29:39.664]  We'll continue with your phone calls then, get into the economy and a lot more.
[01:29:39.724 --> 01:29:42.866]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[01:29:42.906 --> 01:29:43.306]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.011 --> 01:29:53.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.942 --> 01:29:56.630]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:03.913]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:04.213 --> 01:30:04.833]  Number one.
[01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:08.295]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:08.556 --> 01:30:09.136]  Number two.
[01:30:09.416 --> 01:30:13.979]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:14.319 --> 01:30:14.760]  It's true.
[01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:19.623]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:19.923 --> 01:30:20.483]  Number three.
[01:30:20.763 --> 01:30:24.045]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:24.346 --> 01:30:28.028]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.248 --> 01:30:28.789]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.029 --> 01:30:31.411]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:31.791 --> 01:30:35.175]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:35.475 --> 01:30:35.695]  Number 5.
[01:30:36.276 --> 01:30:40.199]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:40.419 --> 01:30:45.184]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:33:36.564 --> 01:33:38.345]  That is coming up right now.
[01:33:38.405 --> 01:33:41.766]  Let's go to Darren in Missouri, or is that in Montana?
[01:33:41.806 --> 01:33:42.386]  You're on the air.
[01:33:42.406 --> 01:33:42.826]  Go ahead.
[01:33:42.846 --> 01:33:44.247]  It's Missouri.
[01:33:44.607 --> 01:33:44.967]  Welcome.
[01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:46.247]  Yeah.
[01:33:46.508 --> 01:33:50.949]  Hey, Saturday night, I'm coming home from a weekend of deer hunting.
[01:33:51.673 --> 01:33:56.315]  At 6.08 PM, I hit a sobriety checkpoint.
[01:33:57.956 --> 01:33:58.977]  Can you imagine?
[01:33:59.857 --> 01:34:02.939]  Who in their right mind would be out driving around drinking at 6 PM?
[01:34:05.387 --> 01:34:06.708]  Well, I'll tell you what's going on.
[01:34:06.748 --> 01:34:08.370]  Those are all under federal grants.
[01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:14.314]  And the feds admit it is to train us and to set the precedent for internal checkpoints.
[01:34:14.715 --> 01:34:16.476]  It has nothing to do with drunk driving.
[01:34:16.917 --> 01:34:19.359]  Who they should do the sobriety test on is the cops.
[01:34:19.899 --> 01:34:23.422]  You know most departments have drug test exemptions for the police.
[01:34:23.862 --> 01:34:26.144]  But then if you want to work at 7-Eleven, they drug test you.
[01:34:26.505 --> 01:34:28.286]  They should be drug testing all those cops.
[01:34:28.606 --> 01:34:30.428]  They like being guilty until proven innocent.
[01:34:30.668 --> 01:34:31.529]  Let's take their blood.
[01:34:32.810 --> 01:34:34.931]  Well, see, I asked the guy, what do you need from me?
[01:34:34.991 --> 01:34:36.792]  Driver's license, registration?
[01:34:36.912 --> 01:34:39.213]  Yeah, driver's license, insurance, and sobriety.
[01:34:39.233 --> 01:34:41.534]  And that was the last mention of sobriety.
[01:34:41.554 --> 01:34:43.394]  He didn't even shine the light in my truck.
[01:34:44.055 --> 01:34:46.596]  He asked me, well, what have you been doing today?
[01:34:46.776 --> 01:34:47.996]  Well, hunting.
[01:34:48.356 --> 01:34:49.357]  Well, hunting for what?
[01:34:49.397 --> 01:34:52.278]  Well, deer's about the only thing open besides coyotes and hogs.
[01:34:52.876 --> 01:34:54.576]  And he can see my deer rifle here.
[01:34:54.596 --> 01:34:56.017]  He can see my camo in the back.
[01:34:56.057 --> 01:34:58.437]  I mean, that was a dumb question.
[01:34:58.517 --> 01:35:07.860]  No, it's all about secret police and training law-abiding general public to have government get in your face, ask you questions, and stick their hand down your pants.
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:16.162]  And Drudge Reports linked to Kurt Nemo's article, the TSA has announced they want everything they're doing in airports to be on the streets of America.
[01:35:17.846 --> 01:35:20.288]  I talked to the state senator of that district.
[01:35:20.389 --> 01:35:22.230]  It happens to be my folks district.
[01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:30.837]  He's not my senator, but he said he actually got pulled over on what would be in Missouri a lettered highway as a, you know, just a wide black top road.
[01:35:31.278 --> 01:35:36.582]  They shut a black top road down in daylight for a sobriety checkpoint.
[01:35:36.642 --> 01:35:38.164]  Yeah, they're not sobriety checkpoints.
[01:35:38.664 --> 01:35:42.828]  We are all, and this is admitted, being trained to live as prisoners, but
[01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:46.431]  They never built but a few miles of the border fence.
[01:35:46.471 --> 01:35:47.913]  They used illegal aliens to build it.
[01:35:47.933 --> 01:35:49.054]  That's Associated Press.
[01:35:49.635 --> 01:35:51.737]  The border's wide open, total bedlam.
[01:35:52.418 --> 01:35:53.259]  That's okay.
[01:35:53.659 --> 01:35:57.704]  But in the middle of the countryside, you are the cattle.
[01:35:57.964 --> 01:36:01.248]  They've gotta get you trained to answer their questions.
[01:36:01.268 --> 01:36:02.829]  Look, cops pulled me over to Checkpoint.
[01:36:03.570 --> 01:36:04.811]  They don't get to ask the questions.
[01:36:04.872 --> 01:36:05.712]  I'm like, you know what?
[01:36:06.153 --> 01:36:11.919]  Supreme Court and state courts have ruled that you can't have checkpoints to check driver's license and ID.
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:18.326]  And let me guess, if I was an illegal alien, you've been ordered to let me go because the judges are going to let them go.
[01:36:18.346 --> 01:36:19.247]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:36:19.968 --> 01:36:21.590]  Well, why don't you get down on the southern border?
[01:36:21.850 --> 01:36:23.211]  Hey, we've just been ordered to do this.
[01:36:23.812 --> 01:36:25.813]  Yeah, I mean, on and on and on.
[01:36:26.053 --> 01:36:31.915]  But yeah, no, these are all federal grants, which also gets the local police trained to be under federal control.
[01:36:32.215 --> 01:36:39.197]  And next, like Texas and many other states do, you're going to have them taking your blood at those checkpoints randomly.
[01:36:39.418 --> 01:36:40.138]  How's that sound?
[01:36:40.178 --> 01:36:41.758]  They want their hands down your pants.
[01:36:42.038 --> 01:36:43.499]  They want that needle in your arm.
[01:36:43.739 --> 01:36:47.640]  They want to get in your comfort zone and set that precedent, Darren.
[01:36:48.501 --> 01:36:51.582]  Yeah, well, I'll tell you, the thing that was most shocking, Alex, is the fact that
[01:36:52.419 --> 01:37:01.263]  On approach of this, and it had just gotten dark, I thought maybe a UFO had landed or a truck had had a spill from the biodiesel plant down the road.
[01:37:01.543 --> 01:37:07.206]  There was at least three times the LEO officers that needed to be there for that sort of operation.
[01:37:07.246 --> 01:37:12.368]  I mean, there was at least 30, 30 LEOs stopping traffic from three directions.
[01:37:12.689 --> 01:37:19.272]  And guaranteed, guaranteed, guaranteed in a 10-mile area, there were robberies going on, you name it, but hey,
[01:37:20.766 --> 01:37:26.270]  Have you noticed if you call the cops most of the time for a real issue, they act all angry like you're bothering them?
[01:37:27.251 --> 01:37:28.732]  Yeah, don't get me started on that.
[01:37:29.272 --> 01:37:37.098]  We had a dispatcher local that just wants to screen calls to what goes out to the patrol cars and I think we finally got her fired.
[01:37:37.218 --> 01:37:39.980]  But yeah, if you need a cop, they're not there to
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:45.944]  To prevent crime, they're there to take a report for the insurance company, and that's about it.
[01:37:46.064 --> 01:37:48.166]  You can't get them to show up unless the crime's already been committed.
[01:37:48.186 --> 01:37:56.734]  Look, it's on record that illegal aliens in every major city, if they do get arrested for drunk driving or whatever, they get released with like $1, $50 fines.
[01:37:57.054 --> 01:37:58.075]  I've seen them for $1, $50.
[01:37:59.076 --> 01:38:02.419]  But citizens, there's just a government hatred of us.
[01:38:02.499 --> 01:38:04.921]  They want to let us know they're the boss.
[01:38:05.001 --> 01:38:08.284]  I appreciate your call, Darren, but how did this end?
[01:38:09.306 --> 01:38:14.390]  Oh, they actually treated me, you know, like I said, I handed him my DL and my insurance paperwork.
[01:38:15.490 --> 01:38:17.111]  He asked me how I did hunting.
[01:38:17.192 --> 01:38:19.913]  I said, you know, no deer, two coyotes.
[01:38:20.554 --> 01:38:23.336]  I joked around and said, well, how's your bag limit holding up?
[01:38:23.356 --> 01:38:24.497]  And he says, well, we're filling up.
[01:38:25.597 --> 01:38:27.078]  And I, you know, have a nice evening.
[01:38:27.419 --> 01:38:29.840]  Kind of, you know, just, he didn't even run my plate.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:30.861]  They might have run my plate.
[01:38:31.328 --> 01:38:33.731]  But I don't think he had time to run my driver's license number off.
[01:38:33.751 --> 01:38:38.016]  Well no, they've got on those squad cars probably license plate readers.
[01:38:38.396 --> 01:38:41.981]  Look, they already know who the criminals are and they're ordered to basically leave them alone.
[01:38:42.021 --> 01:38:43.122]  I appreciate your call, Darren.
[01:38:44.243 --> 01:38:44.844]  Disgusting.
[01:38:45.264 --> 01:38:48.528]  Yeah, it'll be polite now, but not when they pull those needles out to take your blood.
[01:38:49.309 --> 01:38:51.570]  But again, police, you think you're doing this for our own good?
[01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:54.531]  You're doing this for the bankers that have already robbed the country.
[01:38:55.051 --> 01:39:02.374]  And they're putting a straitjacket on the American people, so when we find out what's happened, you're gonna be in place to knock us over the head and keep us in line.
[01:39:02.674 --> 01:39:03.795]  That's all that's going on.
[01:39:04.075 --> 01:39:05.736]  You're helping to destroy your own future.
[01:39:06.536 --> 01:39:08.677]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[01:39:09.929 --> 01:39:11.130]  In fact, I want to make one more comment.
[01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:12.230]  Take Arizona.
[01:39:12.630 --> 01:39:21.575]  A few sheriffs say that if they see a truckload of illegal aliens weaving, that they're going to pull them over and ask them for ID.
[01:39:22.416 --> 01:39:26.658]  And the feds are saying you can't ask someone who you think is an illegal for their ID.
[01:39:27.338 --> 01:39:30.140]  So you can have random checkpoints for citizens all day.
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:34.862]  But if you see a bunch of drunk driving illegal aliens, you've got to leave them alone.
[01:39:34.882 --> 01:39:36.823]  Because the government wants them here.
[01:39:37.403 --> 01:39:38.064]  You understand that?
[01:39:38.988 --> 01:39:41.530]  Let's go ahead and talk to Marcy in Kansas.
[01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:42.191]  Thanks for holding.
[01:39:43.512 --> 01:39:44.152]  Hi, AJ.
[01:39:44.693 --> 01:39:50.517]  I just wanted to voice my concern how upset I am that they're putting this biolab three miles from my house.
[01:39:50.737 --> 01:39:51.698]  I had no idea.
[01:39:51.718 --> 01:39:55.742]  I read the articles last week about Congress holding up the funds for this.
[01:39:56.442 --> 01:40:02.787]  Yeah, Congress says a 70% chance these super bioweapons will leak because they're not in a level 4 facility.
[01:40:03.168 --> 01:40:06.170]  It's level 4 bioweapons in a level 2 facility.
[01:40:06.510 --> 01:40:07.311]  And they're building 36 of these, Marcy.
[01:40:10.148 --> 01:40:12.149]  I mean, they've already started construction.
[01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:14.710]  They've got a police officer that's standing outside.
[01:40:14.770 --> 01:40:16.330]  We went there yesterday, last night.
[01:40:16.851 --> 01:40:23.013]  Outside, they've already leveled off the land, and I thought they were holding the funds for this, and I've got medical problems.
[01:40:23.053 --> 01:40:24.333]  I just got on disability.
[01:40:24.813 --> 01:40:37.798]  I have to drive either to the Cleveland Clinic from here or to Colorado, and they laugh at me because they say, well, we've never seen your problems, and yet they say that, you know, they don't even have, they don't have the hospitals here to prepare for a major disaster, but they're putting this thing
[01:40:38.399 --> 01:40:38.459]  And
[01:40:56.994 --> 01:41:06.779]  And they admit that Plum Island, they admit that Plum Island has leaked bio-weapons into the United States, weaponized Lyme disease and the West Nile.
[01:41:07.379 --> 01:41:14.503]  And yeah, no, if I was you, I would, as soon as you can, probably you're going to need to move.
[01:41:14.943 --> 01:41:15.123]  Yeah.
[01:41:15.143 --> 01:41:15.543]  Yeah, I know.
[01:41:15.683 --> 01:41:21.186]  I mean, it's like they've given us no secure feelings, warm fuzzies about, I don't think this thing's going to stop.
[01:41:21.226 --> 01:41:23.207]  I mean, the Kansas legislature is pushing
[01:41:23.772 --> 01:41:30.241]  to have this thing here and I watched the Jesse Ventura article the show on YouTube about it I had no idea
[01:41:31.434 --> 01:41:33.735]  I don't think they're going to stop.
[01:41:33.915 --> 01:41:41.078]  Well, what's crazy is, 20 years ago, Marcy and I appreciate your call, they wouldn't build something like this on the mainland.
[01:41:41.338 --> 01:41:42.358]  They'd build it on islands.
[01:41:43.039 --> 01:41:44.399]  Now they just don't care and do it.
[01:41:44.419 --> 01:41:51.802]  20 years ago, they wouldn't use depleted uranium in munitions because they knew it hurt the troops and killed them in many cases.
[01:41:52.122 --> 01:41:55.784]  Now they use it everywhere and say, don't even wash your hands, boys, no problem.
[01:41:56.244 --> 01:41:57.604]  They don't care anymore.
[01:41:57.964 --> 01:41:59.105]  They're psychopathic.
[01:42:00.885 --> 01:42:03.006]  And you notice Congress says they don't want it built.
[01:42:03.366 --> 01:42:04.327]  Pentagon doesn't care.
[01:42:04.407 --> 01:42:05.027]  They're the boss.
[01:42:05.107 --> 01:42:05.947]  They run this country.
[01:42:05.967 --> 01:42:06.748]  They got the weapons.
[01:42:08.128 --> 01:42:13.751]  You notice that on so many fronts, you don't want government health care, you're going to get it.
[01:42:15.452 --> 01:42:17.713]  You don't want TSA checkpoints, you're going to get it.
[01:42:18.133 --> 01:42:20.794]  You don't want blood checkpoints on the side of the road, you're going to get it.
[01:42:21.254 --> 01:42:22.995]  They're just doing whatever they want.
[01:42:24.416 --> 01:42:25.696]  This country's gone crazy.
[01:42:26.437 --> 01:42:28.557]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Michigan.
[01:42:28.577 --> 01:42:29.338]  James, you're on the air.
[01:42:29.938 --> 01:42:51.983]  I just want to bring up, we should file federal lawsuits against the TSA, and then if the government brings up that it's because of terrorism, that should force us to have an investigation against the underwear bomber, against 9-11, against all the terror, and that should prove enough that it was an inside job.
[01:42:52.603 --> 01:42:53.363]  Alone.
[01:43:12.549 --> 01:43:14.911]  is pointed at the American people.
[01:43:14.971 --> 01:43:18.474]  They're certainly using it to enslave us.
[01:43:19.014 --> 01:43:23.838]  We have got to say no to this and say no now.
[01:43:24.458 --> 01:43:30.883]  Look, either we expose the stage terror or they use it to fully take over our society.
[01:43:31.344 --> 01:43:32.865]  And it's that simple.
[01:43:32.905 --> 01:43:35.267]  And that's why I totally agree with you, James.
[01:43:35.747 --> 01:43:37.769]  We have got to expose what's happening here.
[01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:45.755]  Not only that, the airports have to be getting funded by the bankers because they're losing millions a year over this.
[01:43:47.096 --> 01:43:47.977]  Nope, nope, nope.
[01:43:48.017 --> 01:43:57.624]  They're losing nine plus billion a year since 2006 and they predict a massive increase of over 40 billion this year.
[01:43:57.744 --> 01:44:05.671]  That's come out in the news and that's why the Pilots Association, the Hotel Association, the Theme Park Association, the other tourism associations are
[01:44:05.911 --> 01:44:08.914]  Yes, not only that, why can't we audit the bankers?
[01:44:08.934 --> 01:44:11.557]  Why can't we file a federal lawsuit against that?
[01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:28.590]  Greenspan saying he is above the law.
[01:44:28.610 --> 01:44:31.031]  In fact, guys, will you pull that Greenspan clip up again?
[01:44:31.691 --> 01:44:31.951]  Thank you.
[01:44:31.971 --> 01:44:34.211]  I want to play him on Laird NewsHour saying they're above the law.
[01:44:34.512 --> 01:44:35.772]  Great point, James.
[01:44:36.252 --> 01:44:42.053]  I'm going to get to Rhonda, Marty, Brenda, John, and others that are patiently holding.
[01:44:43.353 --> 01:44:52.035]  But before I do that, I want to go over the latest TSA just by reading the headlines, and then I want to look at what their counter-strike's going to be.
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:45:06.450]  And I'm not just going to give you my breakdown, knowing their mindset, their modus operandi, the basic pathology of these people, how they operate.
[01:45:07.591 --> 01:45:16.998]  I'm going to give you examples of them operating in plain view right now, staging the printer cartridge attack and the German attack of last week on the German aircraft.
[01:45:18.305 --> 01:45:21.147]  But before I go any further, here's just some of the headlines.
[01:45:21.227 --> 01:45:25.450]  TSA searches, are trains and subways next?
[01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:28.732]  And Kurt Nemo's article goes over it.
[01:45:28.792 --> 01:45:32.554]  They've already announced they are next, and they've already been beta testing it.
[01:45:32.994 --> 01:45:36.156]  And Kurt probably needs to add to the bottom of his article that they've already beta tested it.
[01:45:36.737 --> 01:45:37.697]  Okay, continuing.
[01:45:37.757 --> 01:45:39.218]  That's linked up on Drudge, by the way.
[01:45:39.719 --> 01:45:43.001]  Passenger chooses strip down over pat down.
[01:45:45.612 --> 01:46:00.376]  People are now, like folks did in Germany earlier this year, this happened in San Diego, Samuel Walondky, and I want to get him on the show, they wanted to pat him down so he just stripped down into his underwear.
[01:46:00.396 --> 01:46:01.456]  They went ahead and arrested him.
[01:46:02.237 --> 01:46:04.517]  They also charged another lady for videotaping him.
[01:46:05.318 --> 01:46:09.239]  So they're going to videotape you, but you're not going to videotape them and the commission of their crimes.
[01:46:11.108 --> 01:46:15.771]  Beck says Obama will blame terror attack on TSA resistance.
[01:46:16.171 --> 01:46:19.533]  So Beck, this weekend on Freedom Watch, again follows our lead.
[01:46:20.174 --> 01:46:24.036]  And little-noticed comments made during an appearance of Judge Aaron Napolitano's show on Fox News.
[01:46:24.056 --> 01:46:34.223]  Glenn Beck warned that Obama administration wouldn't hesitate to exploit a terror attack targeting airliners to blame the event on people protesting naked body scanners and TSA groping in airports.
[01:46:35.063 --> 01:46:38.025]  He says, let's get people to rise up and say no to scanners.
[01:46:38.085 --> 01:46:38.746]  Something happens.
[01:46:39.086 --> 01:46:47.512]  The president then has the ability to finally give a speech on airport security and say, I was trying to protect you and these people stood up against these scanners and these people died because of it.
[01:46:47.892 --> 01:46:49.113]  You have to stop listening.
[01:46:49.513 --> 01:46:50.174]  I'll protect you.
[01:46:51.158 --> 01:46:53.340]  That's actually what White House strategists are saying.
[01:46:54.220 --> 01:47:01.585]  Beck went on to say, implying the Obama administration would exploit a terror attack to blame it on those protesting against scanners and TSA groping in airports.
[01:47:02.045 --> 01:47:09.711]  He made similar comments this month, saying the Obama administration would stage a terror attack to blame it on Glenn Beck, myself, and others.
[01:47:12.126 --> 01:47:16.270]  Continuing, here's Mike Adams' Natural News Report on it up at Infowars.com.
[01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:23.036]  TSA needs false flag security incident to convince Americans to accept obscene pat-downs and set that precedent.
[01:47:23.537 --> 01:47:25.759]  And I believe they will be doing it sooner rather than later.
[01:47:25.959 --> 01:47:28.021]  That's what this thing in Germany was, but they got caught.
[01:47:28.561 --> 01:47:30.143]  Another key article by Curt Nemo.
[01:47:30.403 --> 01:47:33.546]  TSA tactics find ominous parallel in Nazi Germany.
[01:47:34.006 --> 01:47:37.350]  They started out by making people just raise their hands up above their heads.
[01:47:38.570 --> 01:47:49.166]  Then, just like the TSA does, and notice in this photo of the body scan, you can see the bones in the guy's hand and the bones in his fingers.
[01:47:50.087 --> 01:47:53.492]  You notice those things are so high powered, it's actually looking into the guy's body there.
[01:47:54.113 --> 01:47:55.834]  I mean, this is what they're hitting your body with.
[01:47:56.335 --> 01:47:59.457]  All these top scientists are on record saying it is giving you radiation dose.
[01:47:59.958 --> 01:48:02.019]  And meanwhile the TSA lies and says it's good for you.
[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:03.341]  Yeah, just like DU is.
[01:48:03.841 --> 01:48:12.708]  But it goes through all the famous photographs of women being herded into pits with their toddlers in their arms about to be machine gunned.
[01:48:13.209 --> 01:48:16.731]  So, uh, tyrants always love to strip you down naked.
[01:48:17.212 --> 01:48:19.894]  The Japanese would do that to our troops before they cut their heads off.
[01:48:20.234 --> 01:48:21.215]  The communists would do it.
[01:48:21.515 --> 01:48:23.157]  It's a final act of humiliation.
[01:48:23.757 --> 01:48:25.338]  They got little babies here with pigtails.
[01:48:25.358 --> 01:48:26.758]  They're getting ready to blow their heads off.
[01:48:27.738 --> 01:48:29.639]  There's even video of it, if you're willing to watch it.
[01:48:30.579 --> 01:48:31.000]  You know what?
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:32.580]  You need to understand what government does.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:34.341]  Germans thought it couldn't happen.
[01:48:34.421 --> 01:48:35.581]  Russians thought it couldn't happen.
[01:48:35.981 --> 01:48:37.302]  Chinese thought it couldn't happen.
[01:48:38.722 --> 01:48:42.264]  When they set the... First, it was papers, please, in 1933.
[01:48:42.784 --> 01:48:46.005]  By 40, it was getting that pit I'm about to blow you and your kids' heads off.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:48.360]  We are the government.
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:53.681]  And they found the control freaks in 33 who wanted to carry out the humiliation.
[01:48:54.021 --> 01:48:55.822]  By 1940, they got what they really wanted.
[01:48:56.202 --> 01:48:57.422]  Drunk on people's blood.
[01:49:01.243 --> 01:49:02.083]  Here's another report.
[01:49:02.423 --> 01:49:04.984]  Will TSA groping destroy tourism in the United States?
[01:49:05.004 --> 01:49:06.104]  We've already talked about that.
[01:49:06.404 --> 01:49:07.464]  It already is destroying it.
[01:49:08.344 --> 01:49:10.845]  Security protests could disrupt Thanksgiving travel.
[01:49:10.885 --> 01:49:11.385]  That's AP.
[01:49:13.564 --> 01:49:14.405]  Uh, continuing.
[01:49:15.105 --> 01:49:17.146]  Now here is the really good news.
[01:49:17.886 --> 01:49:19.187]  Then I'll come back and give you the bad news.
[01:49:19.207 --> 01:49:20.088]  They're gonna strike back.
[01:49:20.568 --> 01:49:22.729]  TSA pat-down went too far.
[01:49:22.889 --> 01:49:30.033]  Agency chief says, ABC News, TSA administrator says search of passengers' underwear should have never happened.
[01:49:30.493 --> 01:49:33.115]  Says agency may think, rethink protocol.
[01:49:33.215 --> 01:49:33.355]  So,
[01:49:39.482 --> 01:49:47.144]  They were talking to ABC and ABC employees and news people are saying, look, they stuck their hands down my pants.
[01:49:47.864 --> 01:49:51.525]  See, they ordered them to do this nationwide a month ago.
[01:49:51.965 --> 01:49:52.905]  They start doing it.
[01:49:53.625 --> 01:50:00.366]  And people just three, four weeks ago couldn't believe me when I said I saw them touching women's genitals through their pants.
[01:50:00.787 --> 01:50:02.467]  People are like, oh, Alex is making that up.
[01:50:03.027 --> 01:50:05.047]  Now it's hands in pants.
[01:50:05.328 --> 01:50:07.108]  People said, oh, Alex is making that up.
[01:50:07.728 --> 01:50:15.192]  Now they're having to admit that that is happening, and they're saying, oh, that may, notice he says, that may be going too far.
[01:50:17.433 --> 01:50:21.555]  See, they're always pushing it as far as they can, training you that they own your body.
[01:50:22.915 --> 01:50:34.381]  The beleaguered head of the Transportation Security Administration said today that at least one airport passenger screening went too far, where an officer reached inside a traveler's underwear, and the agency is open to rethinking its current protocols.
[01:50:35.819 --> 01:50:42.586]  An ABC News employee said she was subjected to a demeaning search at Newark Liberty International Airport Sunday morning.
[01:50:42.947 --> 01:50:47.632]  The woman who checked me reached her hands inside my underwear and felt her way around.
[01:50:47.892 --> 01:50:50.976]  She said, it's basically worse than going to the gynecologist.
[01:50:51.016 --> 01:50:51.796]  It was embarrassing.
[01:50:51.836 --> 01:50:52.397]  It was demeaning.
[01:50:52.838 --> 01:50:53.799]  It was inappropriate.
[01:50:54.039 --> 01:50:55.120]  It was in public!
[01:50:56.341 --> 01:50:57.943]  Stop being in denial!
[01:50:58.003 --> 01:50:58.923]  This is happening!
[01:51:00.044 --> 01:51:00.365]  Fact.
[01:51:00.565 --> 01:51:07.471]  Wood-burning stoves, factory smokestacks, smog, and chemical fumes in the home are all sources of air contamination that can make you sick.
[01:51:07.651 --> 01:51:14.997]  Your exposure to airborne toxic particulate matter and volatile organic compounds every day may be the cause of fatigue, flu-like symptoms, or worse.
[01:51:15.197 --> 01:51:18.680]  These are bad conditions for the very young, older, and the chemically sensitive.

[01:51:59.571 --> 01:52:00.832]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:00.872 --> 01:52:06.234]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:06.475 --> 01:52:11.097]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:11.477 --> 01:52:11.877]  It's true.
[01:52:11.957 --> 01:52:14.539]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:52:14.779 --> 01:52:16.520]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:21.745]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:22.285 --> 01:52:29.212]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:29.392 --> 01:52:30.293]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:30.513 --> 01:52:36.879]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:37.179 --> 01:52:40.041]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:40.381 --> 01:52:42.262]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:52:45.844 --> 01:52:48.185]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:48.605 --> 01:52:55.930]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:56.250 --> 01:52:58.691]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:59.191 --> 01:53:00.792]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[01:53:00.952 --> 01:53:02.053]  How would that make you feel?
[01:53:02.293 --> 01:53:03.674]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:53:04.014 --> 01:53:06.315]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:53:06.556 --> 01:53:13.840]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.461]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:53:16.502 --> 01:53:23.406]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:53:23.666 --> 01:53:28.709]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:53:28.889 --> 01:53:33.773]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:33.993 --> 01:53:38.037]  Order at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:53:38.417 --> 01:53:42.580]  That's HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:53:43.121 --> 01:53:46.463]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[01:53:46.503 --> 01:53:51.167]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:51.207 --> 01:53:54.670]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:54:09.679 --> 01:54:15.304]  Okay, so, they deny they were patting your genitals through your clothes, now they admit it.
[01:54:15.864 --> 01:54:17.705]  They deny they were reaching into your pants.
[01:54:18.366 --> 01:54:26.673]  But when ABC News says it's happening to our employees, you know, we've been videotaping this happening, they say, okay, well maybe we'll look at that.
[01:54:27.674 --> 01:54:30.435]  They're putting their hands down people's pants nationwide.
[01:54:30.715 --> 01:54:32.035]  They've been ordered to do this.
[01:54:32.515 --> 01:54:40.217]  See, this is always a covert program to isolate people, to see what they can get away with, to train these psychotic goons to do anything.
[01:54:41.137 --> 01:54:41.777]  Here's another one.
[01:54:42.718 --> 01:54:47.339]  In shift, TSA chief says screenings to be minimally invasive.
[01:54:47.879 --> 01:54:48.719]  I know their M.O.
[01:54:48.839 --> 01:54:55.701]  They're going to continue, they're going to intensify, and then stonewall and say, we don't know what you're talking about.
[01:54:56.837 --> 01:54:59.666]  Here's another one from the Hill newspaper analyst.
[01:55:00.068 --> 01:55:03.780]  TSA methods will kill more Americans on highway.
[01:55:05.387 --> 01:55:17.430]  The recent public ire towards the TSA new pat-down and body imaging screening methods is likely to cause more people to drive automobiles and forego air travel, say two transportation economists who have studied the issue.
[01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:28.393]  And it goes through Steve Horowitz, professor of economics and others, saying that driving is much more dangerous than flying and are far more likely to be killed in automobile accidents.
[01:55:29.113 --> 01:55:32.714]  The result will be the new TSA procedures will kill more Americans on the highway.
[01:55:33.234 --> 01:55:35.175]  Yes, honeybees kill more than terrorism.
[01:55:36.016 --> 01:55:37.177]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:55:37.217 --> 01:55:41.940]  TSA forces amputee to remove prosthesis, separates her four-year-old son from her.
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:46.764]  I mean, they're taking the kids away now, training the kids to have their genitals touched.
[01:55:52.828 --> 01:55:55.830]  There is a big backlash to remove the TSA from the airports.
[01:55:55.870 --> 01:55:57.691]  These private companies don't even have to have them there.
[01:55:58.832 --> 01:56:01.074]  Now, here's how they're going to counter.
[01:56:02.116 --> 01:56:10.499]  We know that the toner cartridges that were sent in England a month ago, they tested them, the British said, these aren't bombs.
[01:56:10.859 --> 01:56:13.179]  Obama came out and gave a speech and said, yes they are.
[01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:18.581]  How did he know they were supposedly bombs when the British had tested them?
[01:56:19.121 --> 01:56:22.763]  Because they were supposed to play along with the hoax of the drill.
[01:56:23.443 --> 01:56:30.025]  And we now know, buried in an MSNBC article titled, Around the World, a race against time bombs in the air,
[01:56:31.355 --> 01:56:36.460]  And this is from November 6th, so about 18 or 16 days ago.
[01:56:37.901 --> 01:56:51.154]  Buried in the article, it says the FBI called FedEx and UPS, which participated in the government anti-terrorism drill, in August, the exercise, a homemade bomb, slipped onto a cargo plane.
[01:56:52.075 --> 01:56:55.158]  And it goes on, dealing with attacks from Yemen.
[01:56:57.540 --> 01:57:03.842]  Now, you notice that, again, they always use a drill, so if they get caught planting the fake bombs, they don't get in trouble.
[01:57:04.122 --> 01:57:05.422]  Now, what happened last week?
[01:57:07.123 --> 01:57:08.443]  What developed last week?
[01:57:09.363 --> 01:57:15.925]  For two days, they announced that they'd found a bomb, a clock, and explosives in a suitcase on a German airplane.
[01:57:16.625 --> 01:57:26.408]  This came out two days after the German government, the Deutsch government, fear-mongered, headlined, German government warns of possible November terror attack.
[01:57:27.324 --> 01:57:35.307]  And then two days later, magically, a bomb is on a plane.
[01:57:35.727 --> 01:57:36.707]  They say it's real.
[01:57:37.407 --> 01:57:39.668]  Then they come out as a footnote and say it wasn't.
[01:57:40.008 --> 01:57:41.248]  See, all part of the piping.
[01:57:41.709 --> 01:57:42.649]  And then it comes out.
[01:57:48.111 --> 01:57:53.372]  In the AP and the Daily Mail, fake bomb aboard German passenger jet was made by U.S.
[01:57:53.432 --> 01:57:55.553]  firm to test airport security.
[01:57:56.621 --> 01:57:58.863]  The firms that are getting money out of all this security.
[01:57:58.883 --> 01:58:04.188]  A lot of times they use private contractors, so the government has several degrees of separation.
[01:58:05.309 --> 01:58:13.357]  So, a bomb found on German-bound plane in Nambia, police say, and then again, they don't retract and tell you it was the government.
[01:58:14.178 --> 01:58:16.380]  So, how are they going to counter us?
[01:58:17.717 --> 01:58:38.751]  Guaranteed they're gonna find more bombs, they're gonna put more lunatics on board planes that are drugged out of their minds, more Muslim homeless, and it doesn't matter how many witnesses see them getting the homeless person on the plane, doesn't matter how many, it doesn't matter if the State Department comes out and admits they worked for them, the public will then say, give us more genital groping.
[01:58:38.771 --> 01:58:47.277]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:49.707 --> 01:58:56.176]  Hello, Alex Jones has told you about the delicious, safe, easy to fix, and very storable food from eFoodsDirect.
[01:58:56.337 --> 01:58:59.902]  He's also told you that eFoodsDirect has the best food on the planet.
[01:59:00.002 --> 01:59:01.304]  Well, here's the great news.
[01:59:01.724 --> 01:59:04.869]  It's that time of year, and their holiday special is here.
[01:59:05.049 --> 01:59:05.489]  We're good to go!
[01:59:28.496 --> 01:59:29.537]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:29.657 --> 01:59:31.498]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:08.725]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.366 --> 02:00:10.167]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.948 --> 02:00:11.869]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.490 --> 02:00:16.094]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.695 --> 02:00:20.739]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.042 --> 02:00:26.886]  So you can see how this culture of terrorism works.
[02:00:27.767 --> 02:00:28.908]  Give up all your rights.
[02:00:28.988 --> 02:00:31.150]  Let the government stick its hands in your pants.
[02:00:31.751 --> 02:00:33.573]  Let us take blood from you at checkpoints.
[02:00:34.053 --> 02:00:35.295]  Or the terrorists will get you.
[02:00:35.535 --> 02:00:36.896]  The drunk drivers will get you.
[02:00:37.957 --> 02:00:40.240]  Let the government control how much salt you can eat.
[02:00:41.590 --> 02:00:45.411]  If Happy Meals can have toys in it, we want to make sure you eat healthy food.
[02:00:45.731 --> 02:00:52.873]  Meanwhile, they authorize McDonald's to put silicone that causes kidney failure in the McNuggets.
[02:00:54.354 --> 02:00:57.915]  They allow GMO crops to be fed to the public that causes organ failure.
[02:00:58.215 --> 02:01:03.877]  See, they're doing everything to really kill us, but then they'll have this window dressing of how much they love us.
[02:01:06.394 --> 02:01:11.716]  Look at this article, Wi-Fi makes trees sick, study shows, PC World.
[02:01:12.396 --> 02:01:20.019]  Folks, you can look at trees that are even 20 feet from a cell tower and you'll see them all mutated on the side closer to the tower.
[02:01:22.648 --> 02:01:30.450]  I've talked to people that I've seen mowing around power lines, because they're normally city employees, and a lot of times they can speak English.
[02:01:30.990 --> 02:01:36.332]  And I've talked to them, I've said, it looks like the grass doesn't grow as fast or as brown around these power lines.
[02:01:36.372 --> 02:01:37.472]  Are you putting something on them?
[02:01:38.012 --> 02:01:38.833]  Are you spraying these?
[02:01:38.853 --> 02:01:40.273]  They're like, no, it just does that.
[02:01:41.193 --> 02:01:42.694]  Anyways, here's a major study on that.
[02:01:43.214 --> 02:01:44.394]  Off the charts, crazy.
[02:01:45.015 --> 02:01:45.595]  We did find
[02:01:47.527 --> 02:01:48.368]  Jaron found it.
[02:01:48.829 --> 02:01:54.555]  Special Climate Change Program 2009-2012 for Mexico Executive Summary.
[02:01:56.337 --> 02:02:00.022]  And it does have the relocation of the citizens in it.
[02:02:01.087 --> 02:02:02.728]  This is big Agenda 21 news.
[02:02:02.848 --> 02:02:04.249]  I'm going to try to get into that.
[02:02:04.269 --> 02:02:08.271]  We've got Joel Skousen coming up with some big news dealing with government-sponsored terror.
[02:02:09.091 --> 02:02:17.576]  But since I mentioned this, just two weeks ago he met at Jekyll Island for a 100-year celebration of private banker domination of the republic.
[02:02:18.397 --> 02:02:20.698]  Alan Greenspan, who helped engineer the collapse.
[02:02:21.178 --> 02:02:25.421]  This is him last year on Laird NewsHour saying, we're above the law.
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:27.401]  We're outside government.
[02:02:28.021 --> 02:02:31.904]  Government's role doesn't matter because government has no authority over us.
[02:02:34.285 --> 02:02:38.488]  This is the fourth branch of government but it's private and he's telling you he's above the law.
[02:02:40.009 --> 02:02:40.690]  That's a lie.
[02:02:40.990 --> 02:02:42.651]  Let's go ahead and play the Alan Greenspan clip.
[02:02:42.671 --> 02:02:42.991]  Here it is.
[02:02:43.832 --> 02:02:51.637]  What is the proper relationship, what should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[02:02:53.251 --> 02:03:06.945]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[02:03:08.386 --> 02:03:26.657]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[02:03:26.857 --> 02:03:30.219]  And I've had very good relationships with the press.
[02:03:31.739 --> 02:03:32.900]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:34.501]  Just incredible.
[02:03:35.001 --> 02:03:37.823]  Now, this latest story
[02:03:40.763 --> 02:03:56.941]  I remember ten years ago, it was in 2000, seeing Toyota and General Motors say that in the next decade or so, and now here we are, they want cameras in all the cars that watch the driver.
[02:03:57.950 --> 02:04:01.693]  To make sure you're not distracted, to make sure you're not drinking, to make sure you're not sleeping.
[02:04:01.753 --> 02:04:07.176]  So, guilty until proven innocent, 1984, camera in the car.
[02:04:07.236 --> 02:04:15.182]  And they also said that they would sell it to the public with pressure sensors in the seats to see if a child was in the car alone.
[02:04:15.782 --> 02:04:18.024]  Or to see if the child had been locked in the car.
[02:04:18.344 --> 02:04:20.746]  Why it would save 31 lives a year on average.
[02:04:20.986 --> 02:04:21.946]  Just total big brother.
[02:04:22.427 --> 02:04:25.209]  Then the Houston police chief came out and said he wants cameras in all the homes.
[02:04:27.285 --> 02:04:36.369]  Now, the Transportation Secretary, who's openly said he's anti-car in the Wall Street Journal earlier this year, will tell you about what he has to say when we get back.
[02:04:36.429 --> 02:04:38.150]  This is incredible.
[02:04:38.810 --> 02:04:45.292]  I mean, this is the nanny state on total mega-steroids, and they're not doing it because they care about you.
[02:04:45.693 --> 02:04:50.915]  They are doing all of this to train you to live in a surveillance bubble of total control.
[02:04:51.255 --> 02:04:53.316]  But then things that really harm you and hurt you
[02:04:54.534 --> 02:04:56.375]  They don't just not care about it, they're behind it.
[02:04:57.275 --> 02:04:59.156]  We've also got an important guest coming up.
[02:05:00.136 --> 02:05:05.598]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:06.779 --> 02:05:11.541]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:11.921 --> 02:05:18.723]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:20.644 --> 02:05:22.665]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:24.721 --> 02:05:26.974]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:05:29.148 --> 02:05:33.011]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:05:33.732 --> 02:05:36.854]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:05:37.575 --> 02:05:38.376]  Others don't.
[02:05:38.796 --> 02:05:40.677]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:40.958 --> 02:05:42.459]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:42.739 --> 02:05:45.301]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:45.621 --> 02:05:51.886]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:05:52.247 --> 02:05:54.469]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:05:54.949 --> 02:05:56.991]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[02:05:57.311 --> 02:05:58.192]  Others don't.
[02:05:59.346 --> 02:06:03.569]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:03.889 --> 02:06:04.170]  Number 1.
[02:06:04.810 --> 02:06:07.952]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:08.233 --> 02:06:08.793]  Number 2.
[02:06:09.093 --> 02:06:13.637]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:13.977 --> 02:06:14.417]  It's true.
[02:06:14.717 --> 02:06:19.281]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:19.601 --> 02:06:20.141]  Number 3.
[02:06:20.422 --> 02:06:23.704]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:24.004 --> 02:06:27.707]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:27.907 --> 02:06:28.448]  Number 4.
[02:06:28.708 --> 02:06:31.070]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:34.854]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:35.154 --> 02:06:35.354]  Number 5.
[02:06:35.935 --> 02:06:39.858]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:40.078 --> 02:06:44.843]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:45.123 --> 02:06:49.149]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:49.309 --> 02:06:50.871]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:51.091 --> 02:06:53.174]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:06:53.334 --> 02:06:55.698]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:00.011 --> 02:07:14.476]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:07:15.497 --> 02:07:19.158]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:20.191 --> 02:07:32.183]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:07:32.943 --> 02:07:40.210]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:07:40.891 --> 02:07:50.499]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:54.542]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:07:55.203 --> 02:07:58.386]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:08:00.167 --> 02:08:05.712]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:23.385 --> 02:08:28.228]  Okay, we've got huge breaking news that ties into the whole continuum.
[02:08:28.769 --> 02:08:34.213]  Another big piece of the puzzle dealing with government-sponsored terror, this time in England, coming up in just a few minutes.
[02:08:34.313 --> 02:08:38.836]  But, I've got two reports I want to hit today that tie together.
[02:08:39.616 --> 02:08:44.119]  One is from PC World, and the other is from Popular Science.
[02:08:45.131 --> 02:08:46.692]  Two different major magazines.
[02:08:47.312 --> 02:08:49.934]  Wi-Fi makes trees sick, study says.
[02:08:50.474 --> 02:09:00.320]  Radiation from Wi-Fi networks is harmful to trees, causing significant variations in growth, as well as bleeding and fissures in the bark, according to a recent study in the Netherlands.
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:05.363]  Radiation from Wi-Fi networks is harmful to trees, causing significant variations in growth.
[02:09:05.823 --> 02:09:06.964]  It's shown the same thing in humans.
[02:09:06.984 --> 02:09:09.666]  It breaks up the DNA strands, it causes brain tumors.
[02:09:11.164 --> 02:09:14.886]  As well as bleeding and fissures in the bark, according to a recent study in the Netherlands.
[02:09:16.767 --> 02:09:20.509]  And it says all deciduous trees in the Western world are affected, according to the study.
[02:09:21.978 --> 02:09:25.060]  I can eyeball, and not just in one case or two cases, but in thousands.
[02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:26.922]  I mean, I'm observant, folks.
[02:09:26.942 --> 02:09:28.123]  And I think that's what's important.
[02:09:28.583 --> 02:09:30.224]  I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
[02:09:50.097 --> 02:09:52.518]  You know, there are people a lot smarter than I am, but I'm observant.
[02:09:52.638 --> 02:09:53.359]  I'm street smart.
[02:09:54.179 --> 02:09:56.200]  You know, I come from good old farming stock.
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:02.723]  And everywhere I go, I look at trees that are next to power towers, next to cell phone towers.
[02:10:04.065 --> 02:10:09.408]  And you can see, not just where they're touching, but where they're even 10 feet away, they're growing slowly.
[02:10:09.468 --> 02:10:10.409]  They're deformed.
[02:10:10.449 --> 02:10:12.910]  They've got lacerations.
[02:10:13.611 --> 02:10:14.871]  I've seen it with the grass.
[02:10:15.392 --> 02:10:17.433]  And I've seen other studies that show this as well.
[02:10:18.413 --> 02:10:26.998]  Besides the electromagnetic fields created by mobile phone networks and wireless LANs, ultra-fine particles emitted by cars and trucks may also be to blame.
[02:10:27.038 --> 02:10:27.558]  And it goes on.
[02:10:29.639 --> 02:10:31.060]  Here's popular science.
[02:10:31.460 --> 02:10:33.401]  To thwart distracted driving, U.S.
[02:10:33.421 --> 02:10:35.843]  government considers cell phone jamming in cars.
[02:10:36.563 --> 02:10:40.546]  Now, the jammer is also a receiver transmitter.
[02:10:41.186 --> 02:10:42.487]  This is government surveillance.
[02:10:42.507 --> 02:10:46.829]  That's what Toyota wants under federal auspices, is a camera that watches you in your car.
[02:10:48.021 --> 02:11:01.687]  to see if you're quote distracted driving or tired or drinking so you're guilty until proven innocent and they're now proposing this they're also saying well in case a child's in the car unattended the AI software
[02:11:02.802 --> 02:11:03.662]  Very inexpensive.
[02:11:03.722 --> 02:11:10.766]  The chip with an infrared camera, so even if it's dark, will know if a child's in the car or if you're drinking.
[02:11:10.826 --> 02:11:12.847]  It will, quote, tell if you look tired.
[02:11:13.267 --> 02:11:14.107]  It's all quackery.
[02:11:14.488 --> 02:11:19.450]  And then we'll access a cell phone on Star System in the car and call police.
[02:11:20.110 --> 02:11:20.570]  So this is 1984.
[02:11:22.191 --> 02:11:27.878]  And it's got Ray LaHood, who said he's anti-car openly in the news, in the Wall Street Journal earlier this year.
[02:11:28.398 --> 02:11:29.920]  He said, we want to get cars off the road.
[02:11:30.381 --> 02:11:38.090]  The Obama administration is considering disabling cell phones in American cars, aimed at cutting down on distracted drivers and cell phone related road deaths.
[02:11:39.568 --> 02:11:42.090]  But meanwhile, they're not worried about the cell phones themselves giving you cancer.
[02:11:42.750 --> 02:11:53.878]  The Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, the nation's preeminent anti-distracted driving crusader, said in an interview on MSNBC yesterday the federal officials are looking at technology to disable cell phones inside cars.
[02:11:54.238 --> 02:11:58.080]  You notice already at G20 meetings and other protests, they'll disable cell phones.
[02:11:58.441 --> 02:12:00.862]  This is just all part of this total surveillance grid.
[02:12:01.323 --> 02:12:02.383]  I thought that was important.
[02:12:02.743 --> 02:12:03.464]  We just covered it.
[02:12:03.824 --> 02:12:07.367]  Now, here's the major breaking news for the rest of this hour.
[02:12:07.387 --> 02:12:09.328]  A little bit of financial news right at the end.
[02:12:11.289 --> 02:12:12.689]  Of course, he needs no introduction.
[02:12:13.349 --> 02:12:20.292]  Joel Skousen, his uncle, wrote The Naked Communist and The Naked Capitalist, really expanding our paradigm of political understanding.
[02:12:20.672 --> 02:12:26.715]  He's the editor-in-chief of World Affairs Brief, worldaffairsbrief.com, political scientist, also a...
[02:12:27.475 --> 02:12:30.737]  Fighter bomber pilot and a lot more.
[02:12:30.878 --> 02:12:34.380]  I won't go through his entire bio because of time constraints.
[02:12:35.201 --> 02:12:38.063]  He has a huge breaking analysis.
[02:12:38.623 --> 02:12:40.605]  Lord James to the House of Lords.
[02:12:40.805 --> 02:12:42.466]  I laundered money for IRA.
[02:12:42.986 --> 02:12:45.748]  Terrorism conspiracy in the UK involving Bank of England.
[02:12:46.309 --> 02:12:47.490]  All of this on the heels
[02:12:48.911 --> 02:12:51.093]  Of the German bomb last week being a U.S.
[02:12:51.153 --> 02:12:53.934]  drill, so were the printer cartridges, folks.
[02:12:54.355 --> 02:12:55.556]  The British said they weren't bombs.
[02:12:55.656 --> 02:12:57.797]  Obama said, hey, we know they're bombs.
[02:12:58.077 --> 02:12:58.638]  Check them again.
[02:12:58.658 --> 02:13:02.240]  I mean, slap the cuffs on right there, folks.
[02:13:02.700 --> 02:13:03.781]  They're doing this out in the open.
[02:13:04.341 --> 02:13:08.304]  Now, you've got all these Obama and Clinton advisers saying Obama needs terror.
[02:13:08.604 --> 02:13:09.905]  They're saying it on Meet the Press.
[02:13:10.446 --> 02:13:12.907]  They're saying it in the Financial Times of London.
[02:13:13.428 --> 02:13:14.708]  They are really gearing up.
[02:13:15.868 --> 02:13:19.250]  They see this huge protest against the TSA and this act of domination.
[02:13:19.771 --> 02:13:27.115]  They know that they're going to let this grow up to a crescendo, then stage events and say, we don't ever want to hear any complaints.
[02:13:27.456 --> 02:13:32.039]  You cause deaths, even though more people die each year from honeybee stings than from terror.
[02:13:32.859 --> 02:13:36.722]  So I wanted to get Joel Skousen's take on government-sponsored terror first.
[02:13:37.482 --> 02:13:41.505]  What's happening with the TSA and how that dovetails with Glenn Beck,
[02:13:42.694 --> 02:13:53.698]  Harolda Rivera came out twice in the last week and said 9-11 could be an inside job, that Building 7 may have been a controlled demolition, that 9-11 truth may not be despicable now.
[02:13:54.678 --> 02:13:56.459]  Why is Rupert Murdoch green-lighting that?
[02:13:57.259 --> 02:14:04.202]  Beck has come out and directly said Obama's people are getting ready for a new Oklahoma City bombing, to be blamed on Beck.
[02:14:04.842 --> 02:14:07.946]  And, of course, in those reports they're issuing, they blame yours truly as well.
[02:14:08.146 --> 02:14:09.748]  But Beck says he's the center of the universe.
[02:14:10.148 --> 02:14:11.590]  The point is a major shift.
[02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:18.698]  Joel, we're going to break in about six minutes, but you've got the floor on this constellation of issues that orbit each other.
[02:14:18.978 --> 02:14:21.321]  Break down what you see happening right now.
[02:14:22.796 --> 02:14:24.837]  Well, let's talk about the TSA thing first.
[02:14:24.937 --> 02:14:34.140]  It's very important for our listeners to understand the two provocations that gave TSA all of the excuse and justification to go through taking your shoes off.
[02:14:34.180 --> 02:14:35.161]  That was the shoe bomber.
[02:14:35.201 --> 02:14:41.703]  The crotch bomber gave us these backscatter x-ray naked scanners, as we call them.
[02:14:42.224 --> 02:14:46.245]  But both of those provocations were absolutely false terrorism.
[02:14:46.725 --> 02:14:50.547]  There is no way that an actual trained terrorist would not know
[02:14:51.187 --> 02:14:53.669]  And the government helped both of them get on the planes?
[02:14:53.689 --> 02:14:54.270]  That's on record.
[02:15:10.473 --> 02:15:11.073]  Absolutely.
[02:15:11.554 --> 02:15:29.001]  So I am convinced that if, in fact, the American people, and there's a major backlash against this groping-type pat-down and against the scanners, that their only solution is to throw another false terrorist attack to show us, look, we've got to have these things, so everyone ought to shut up.
[02:15:29.542 --> 02:15:31.082]  And I think that's exactly what's coming.
[02:15:31.623 --> 02:15:33.283]  They will not take no for an answer.
[02:15:33.303 --> 02:15:38.826]  Now, one of the things that I'm most concerned about, I pointed out in my World Affairs Brief this past Friday's issue,
[02:15:40.305 --> 02:15:43.007]  It's that I think there's a trend here.
[02:15:43.828 --> 02:15:54.956]  I'm very, very worried that they're violating a major rule they've had a long time, that you don't bother the majority of American people too much or there'll be a backlash.
[02:15:55.096 --> 02:16:00.860]  And they are clearly at the airport bothering the majority of American people and they're getting a backlash.
[02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:06.644]  So why would they go against their own general rules against initiating a backlash?
[02:16:07.004 --> 02:16:07.465]  I mean, even
[02:16:08.533 --> 02:16:12.300]  So they're getting us ready to unveil the American people as the enemy?
[02:16:21.857 --> 02:16:25.579]  But there's another catch-22 here, and that's what happened with the pilots.
[02:16:25.599 --> 02:16:29.180]  The pilots had a legitimate reason not to have to go through these scanners.
[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:36.844]  I mean, if you can't trust the pilots with the airplane, who have background checks, who are authorized to carry firearms in the airplane, then who can you trust?
[02:16:37.744 --> 02:16:49.770]  Plus, once they're in the airplane, as you know, sir, and you're a pilot yourself, a fighter pilot, once you're in the airplane, a 747 940-something thousand pounds, the biggest missile you can get, it's asinine!
[02:16:50.590 --> 02:16:51.391]  Absolutely true.
[02:16:51.931 --> 02:17:06.544]  And so what happened, they entered into secret negotiations with the Obama administration this week, and the Obama administration, seeing this bullet coming, that they could not sustain making pilots going through this obnoxious security stuff, they offered them a deal.
[02:17:07.065 --> 02:17:14.451]  That if you agree to give us biometric scans, so that we have a biometric ID, they will let you off the hook.
[02:17:14.491 --> 02:17:15.192]  Now, I think
[02:17:15.792 --> 02:17:18.855]  There's a possibility they may offer this to the American people.
[02:17:18.875 --> 02:17:19.936]  You're right, they already did it.
[02:17:19.996 --> 02:17:23.279]  They said, don't worry, by next year we'll have trusted traveler.
[02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:33.369]  If you go through, and then that sets the precedent that the government authorizes travel or not, and basically legitimizes and standardizes the no-fly list.
[02:17:34.093 --> 02:17:37.275]  That's exactly right, and I think it's something that people will jump at.
[02:17:37.295 --> 02:17:40.177]  It's a pure Hegelian dialectic.
[02:17:40.217 --> 02:17:42.739]  You create enough tension, then you say, we give you an out.
[02:17:43.599 --> 02:17:48.663]  And you'll jump at it because it's so much better than being groped by TSA.
[02:17:49.163 --> 02:17:50.764]  And I think that's what they're setting us up for.
[02:17:51.943 --> 02:17:55.466]  I can totally concur with you and your gut is already confirmed.
[02:17:55.626 --> 02:17:56.346]  You must have missed it.
[02:17:56.386 --> 02:17:58.768]  They are now actually announcing this.
[02:17:58.828 --> 02:18:09.055]  And TSA, going back to Homeland Security head Ridge about seven years ago, he said, you will have a not just a no-fly list, a no-buy list, a no-job list.
[02:18:09.355 --> 02:18:12.077]  You'll have to have this card in biometrics to do everything.
[02:18:12.298 --> 02:18:15.520]  And then that's the true cashless society control grid.
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:19.543]  Then they claim any underground economy is now associated with terrorism.
[02:18:21.277 --> 02:18:28.244]  Yeah, I think that's where we're headed, and as I say, they're using this type of false flag terrorism in order to drive all of this.
[02:18:28.944 --> 02:18:33.328]  But I do feel that we're going to get some other kind of terrorist attack here.
[02:18:33.348 --> 02:18:44.419]  It's just been a long time, and not only is skepticism growing about 9-11, but it's also in rage now about the TSA, and so they've got a problem here.
[02:18:44.935 --> 02:18:47.799]  I'm going to skip this network break so stations should stay with us.
[02:18:47.819 --> 02:18:51.263]  This is a network break we're skipping because I want to give Joel more time today.
[02:18:51.984 --> 02:19:02.137]  Joel, before we get into Beck and then into the larger issue, this government-sponsored terror in England hidden in plain view is just amazing and the same strategy of tension.
[02:19:04.358 --> 02:19:09.961]  What are your ideas, then, to preemptively deal with them staging a new attack?
[02:19:11.121 --> 02:19:16.284]  What do you think my millions of listeners, from your perspective, should be doing to head them off at the pass?
[02:19:18.365 --> 02:19:25.368]  Well, it's very difficult to develop a strategy because, you know, the stuff works on the dumbed-down Americans.
[02:19:25.968 --> 02:19:30.611]  But what we really need to help people understand is that there's a pattern of false flag terrorism.
[02:19:32.003 --> 02:19:33.824]  Conspiracy analysis is so important.
[02:19:33.864 --> 02:19:38.065]  Not only about 9-11, but about just what I said about the crotch bomber and the shoe bomber.
[02:19:38.485 --> 02:19:51.470]  The fact that you have sophisticated, supposedly sophisticated, trained terrorists, you know, that learn to fly airplanes, you know, 757s on Cessnas, which is an impossibility, I can tell you that as a pilot.
[02:19:52.216 --> 02:19:55.778]  And you have crotch bombers that don't know that you can't light it explode.
[02:19:56.519 --> 02:19:57.679]  This is what's going to happen again.
[02:19:57.699 --> 02:20:02.442]  There's going to be another terrorist attempt, not an attack, probably an attempt.
[02:20:03.423 --> 02:20:06.625]  And those are the things that are most easily to develop.
[02:20:06.645 --> 02:20:13.249]  So we've got to train people to know the answers, particularly about how to identify false terrorism versus true terrorism.
[02:20:14.130 --> 02:20:20.934]  But you know, what we're talking about in this week's World Affairs Brief, we very rarely get open admissions
[02:20:21.741 --> 02:20:22.642]  And that wasn't a joke!
[02:20:22.802 --> 02:20:25.404]  He said, I get my orders from Mr. Kissinger.
[02:20:38.746 --> 02:20:43.389]  Yeah, and he said, you know, filter down through Brent Scowcroft to Sandy Berger, who are here with us today.
[02:20:43.409 --> 02:20:45.330]  I mean, this was just no mistake.
[02:20:45.390 --> 02:20:49.233]  This was too many specifics, and it's right out in the open.
[02:20:49.853 --> 02:20:57.018]  The number two one, of course, was the whistleblower out of the City of London, which I covered on May 7th in my World Affairs Brief.
[02:20:57.478 --> 02:21:01.680]  This didn't get much coverage in the press, but it was a blockbuster one.
[02:21:02.060 --> 02:21:05.742]  Here's this guy in the City of London, who is a major financier.
[02:21:05.802 --> 02:21:08.684]  Now, the City of London, remember, is a city within a city.
[02:21:09.044 --> 02:21:11.585]  This is not the metropolitan government of London.
[02:21:11.866 --> 02:21:15.367]  This is the ancient, medieval City of London government.
[02:21:15.567 --> 02:21:18.089]  It's just like the Vatican or the District of Columbia.
[02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:22.131]  These globalists always create their own above-the-law command base.
[02:21:23.137 --> 02:21:32.123]  That's right, and this is where all of the financial manipulation of the Anglo-American Society and Bank of England happens in the City of London.
[02:21:32.783 --> 02:21:34.744]  He was a major financial advisor.
[02:21:35.245 --> 02:21:42.930]  He met 30 times a year with all the other major financial powers that be within the City of London.
[02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:45.872]  But he was not part of the powers-that-be system.
[02:21:46.572 --> 02:21:49.294]  But he mistakenly got invited to a meeting
[02:21:50.203 --> 02:21:52.004]  Since he's been with these same people.
[02:21:52.024 --> 02:21:52.964]  He got into the meeting.
[02:21:53.085 --> 02:21:56.146]  These are the same people he's been meeting with for months and years.
[02:21:56.746 --> 02:21:59.908]  And all of a sudden, three other high British officials come in.
[02:21:59.968 --> 02:22:03.230]  They sit down and they immediately start talking about conspiracy issues.
[02:22:03.790 --> 02:22:04.590]  About war.
[02:22:04.710 --> 02:22:05.651]  Inducing China.
[02:22:06.511 --> 02:22:08.072]  Inducing a war with Iran.
[02:22:08.112 --> 02:22:13.155]  And inducing Israel to strike Iran in order to get the West involved in a war with Iran.
[02:22:14.364 --> 02:22:15.865]  And he was just shocked out of his chair.
[02:22:15.925 --> 02:22:19.988]  He says, you know, here they're talking as if we're all initiates and I'm not one of them.
[02:22:20.989 --> 02:22:22.190]  But they all think I am.
[02:22:22.210 --> 02:22:25.553]  And when he went public on the silver manipulation, well, go ahead.
[02:22:26.493 --> 02:22:26.894]  That's right.
[02:22:26.974 --> 02:22:28.955]  Well, you know, there's this story, finally.
[02:22:28.995 --> 02:22:30.016]  Now, this happened in 2003.
[02:22:30.116 --> 02:22:36.381]  It took him this long to finally decide after he'd studied conspiracy issues, tried to make heads or tails of what he was hearing.
[02:22:37.313 --> 02:22:41.317]  He came out and gave an interview where all of this came out.
[02:22:41.498 --> 02:22:50.787]  That was a major story that bolsters not only our suspicion that an attack on Iran is coming, but that Israel will be the provocation.
[02:22:51.488 --> 02:22:57.655]  Also interesting in that story, it's the first time I've ever found anyone coming out of the inside
[02:22:58.662 --> 02:23:01.624]  Uh, powers that be, and confirm my theory.
[02:23:01.644 --> 02:23:09.228]  I'm the only one on this planet that has the theory in this next World War III scenario, whereby Russia and China will strike the West.
[02:23:09.928 --> 02:23:22.135]  But I said the way that the, the, uh, West will beat Russia, even after absorbing a nuclear first strike, will be that they'll get Russia, uh, China, to betray Russia and attack its rear.
[02:23:23.363 --> 02:23:37.153]  And he came out in that very same interview, he said, in that meeting, he said, I couldn't make heads or tails of what this meant, but they talked about inducing China to attack Russia during the next war so that they could help win the war.
[02:23:37.653 --> 02:23:38.854]  And he didn't know what that meant.
[02:23:39.294 --> 02:23:43.137]  And that's why there's this deep alliance between the Anglo-Americans and China.
[02:23:43.397 --> 02:23:50.182]  That's why they give them the Panama Canal, give them all the jobs, let them buy all the debt, let them buy up the oil refineries here in the U.S.
[02:23:50.202 --> 02:23:51.923]  because they're strategic partners.
[02:23:52.691 --> 02:23:53.291]  That's correct.
[02:23:53.471 --> 02:23:53.872]  I agree.
[02:23:53.932 --> 02:23:57.874]  I see all the signs there, and I see the CFR calling it the Chinese Century.
[02:23:58.254 --> 02:24:00.456]  They've clearly made this decision back in the 70s.
[02:24:02.157 --> 02:24:11.022]  But you know the big story, and this is the number three, we had James Jones, we had this whistleblower out of the city of London, and now we're coming out of London with Lord James Blackheath.
[02:24:11.502 --> 02:24:13.483]  Let me set the stage.
[02:24:13.523 --> 02:24:15.024]  Here, this is the House of Lords.
[02:24:15.204 --> 02:24:16.125]  No press allowed.
[02:24:16.145 --> 02:24:16.945]  This is private.
[02:24:17.005 --> 02:24:20.067]  This is what allows a person to make these kinds of statements.
[02:24:20.723 --> 02:24:34.893]  So he starts talking to the House of Lords, this is Lord James of Blackheath, about the fact that there's a super-secret, powerful foundation or operation in the world that deals with the highest government levels.
[02:24:35.113 --> 02:24:44.359]  He says, I will call it Foundation X. He's talking to the House of Lords and he says, they contacted me and they suggested or offered
[02:24:44.989 --> 02:24:55.353]  To loan the British government enough money to take care of its debt and the British government would then be indebted to them instead of to the world and the IMF and all of those debt things.
[02:24:55.513 --> 02:24:57.413]  And that even came out in mainstream news!
[02:24:57.453 --> 02:24:58.594]  That was so incredible!
[02:24:58.914 --> 02:25:01.755]  Secret foundations will fund your whole government!
[02:25:02.415 --> 02:25:02.895]  That's right.
[02:25:03.356 --> 02:25:15.385]  Now, the most interesting thing is here, and this only got coverage of the Belfast Telegraph, because they're very much involved in what happened with the IRA, is that someone in the House of Lords protested and said,
[02:25:16.696 --> 02:25:19.297]  Lord Blackie, there's no way that they would contact you.
[02:25:19.817 --> 02:25:21.338]  They only talked to heads of state.
[02:25:21.358 --> 02:25:28.741]  In other words, this is a guy in the House of Lords who knew about this, and a lot of other people apparently knew about this secret organization that had all this power.
[02:25:29.101 --> 02:25:30.481]  They said they wouldn't be talking to you.
[02:25:31.122 --> 02:25:34.943]  And so what Lord James does in rebuttal is to, what do you mean?
[02:25:34.963 --> 02:25:43.106]  He says, I'm a bigger wig than you think in this stuff, because I helped launder billions of pounds for the IRA through the Bank of England.
[02:25:43.446 --> 02:25:44.607]  That's why they would talk to me.
[02:25:45.643 --> 02:25:47.223]  And all of a sudden there was a major gasp.
[02:25:47.864 --> 02:25:56.466]  And here he is, Lord James, admitting that the Bank of England was involved in laundering money for the IRA to fund terrorism in the IRA.
[02:25:56.606 --> 02:25:57.086]  Amazing.
[02:25:58.066 --> 02:26:03.048]  And right there in the open, of course there's no press there, but there were obviously leaks coming out of this.
[02:26:03.828 --> 02:26:08.289]  But here he, and he even said, and we laundered money for the African terrorists.
[02:26:08.329 --> 02:26:11.890]  He says, I can't talk about that because that's still a security issue.
[02:26:12.921 --> 02:26:22.387]  But you see, ever since it blew wide open a couple of years ago, that Kevin Maguire, number two security in the IRA, was a British agent.
[02:26:43.973 --> 02:27:00.643]  Well, and the key point about that is that because it got blown wide open that the IRA was a British operation, and I even covered in the World Affairs Brief how the CIA had shipped rockets and missiles and even a dismantled helicopter in a C-130 over to the IRA, and the whistleblower blew the whistle.
[02:27:00.683 --> 02:27:04.326]  I mean, this is a government operation, this entire terrorism of the IRA.
[02:27:04.346 --> 02:27:05.386]  So they dismantled it.
[02:27:05.726 --> 02:27:11.410]  They came up and concocted the story that the IRA has suddenly decided to quit.
[02:27:12.142 --> 02:27:14.466]  And we've had a peaceful solution and it's gone away.
[02:27:14.506 --> 02:27:22.077]  And now that's why Lord James of Blackheath could come out and say, I can talk about the IRA because that's gone now.
[02:27:22.277 --> 02:27:28.586]  But I can't talk for security reasons about our continued funding of terrorism in the North African terrorists.
[02:27:28.686 --> 02:27:34.871]  I don't want to get into that now, but why is so much of this starting to leak?
[02:27:34.951 --> 02:27:42.197]  Why is Geraldo Rivera, now on two shows in the last week on Fox, saying 9-11 truth may be right, controlled demolition.
[02:27:42.497 --> 02:27:51.425]  Why is Beck, in your educated opinion, coming out and saying Obama's people are preparing a new Oklahoma City to be blamed on the Patriots?
[02:27:51.765 --> 02:27:54.747]  I mean, this is being authorized by Rupert Murdoch.
[02:27:56.149 --> 02:27:57.069]  I'm not sure it is.
[02:27:58.743 --> 02:27:59.724]  This is a tough thing.
[02:27:59.764 --> 02:28:01.727]  You know, conspiracy is the weak link.
[02:28:02.147 --> 02:28:07.294]  It's why the media denigrates conspiracy theory and facts so vehemently.
[02:28:07.374 --> 02:28:14.763]  It's because this is the only thing that's capable of blowing wide open the fact that we've got a controlled government, two controlled political parties.
[02:28:15.709 --> 02:28:19.731]  Glenn Beck has always been on the wrong side of the conspiracy issue because of 9-11.
[02:28:19.771 --> 02:28:25.274]  He got on the wrong side early and he denigrated people who believed the 9-11 conspiracy.
[02:28:25.674 --> 02:28:28.836]  Suddenly, it appears that Glenn Beck's starting to turn the corner.
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:40.710]  You know, he, I thought to myself, you know, look, his mentor, Glenn Beck's mentor is my uncle, W. Crowne Skousen, who wrote the book on conspiracy, the original one, about- Literally wrote the book, yeah.
[02:28:41.150 --> 02:28:45.254]  The Naked Capitalist, and how can you have him as a mentor and be denigrating conspiracy?
[02:28:45.594 --> 02:28:49.558]  Well, I found out that he couldn't put, or refused to put two and two together.
[02:28:50.058 --> 02:28:59.796]  Yeah, he could believe, and he believes very strongly now, that there is a globalist conspiracy, because that's what's involved with communism and the bigger factor, but he couldn't see it.
[02:29:01.502 --> 02:29:07.804]  You know, in front of himself, in terms of 9-11 or Oklahoma City bombing, some of those other aspects.
[02:29:07.864 --> 02:29:09.804]  And now he's starting to believe it.
[02:29:09.824 --> 02:29:17.326]  I'm not sure he can come clean and admit that he was wrong on television, but he clearly now believes a conspiracy.
[02:29:17.346 --> 02:29:18.247]  And I think it's moving that way.
[02:29:18.267 --> 02:29:19.387]  And the same thing with Rivero.
[02:29:19.807 --> 02:29:20.747]  He's turning the corner.
[02:29:21.587 --> 02:29:22.888]  And they haven't shut him down yet.
[02:29:22.988 --> 02:29:24.288]  And that may well happen yet.
[02:29:25.929 --> 02:29:30.570]  Yeah, I'm not at liberty to talk about it, because I don't give up sources, but
[02:29:32.261 --> 02:29:42.784]  When we get back, I've got something brief to say about that, because I've got a lot of moles, a lot of feelers out there, and Glenn Beck's got big torpedoes coming his way.
[02:29:43.164 --> 02:29:43.564]  Big ones.
[02:29:43.664 --> 02:29:44.344]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:44.364 --> 02:29:44.805]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.066 --> 02:29:50.946]  We're on the march.

[02:34:08.046 --> 02:34:09.988]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:34:10.829 --> 02:34:16.834]  Continuing on protecting ourselves from the globalist poisoning of the water, I want to tell you about PureWaterFreedom.com.
[02:34:17.034 --> 02:34:21.599]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit PureWaterFreedom.com.

[02:34:58.619 --> 02:35:04.000]  Most of the new IDs or passports or driver's license have them.
[02:35:04.620 --> 02:35:06.161]  And of course, it's designed for fraud.
[02:35:06.201 --> 02:35:09.481]  So when it falls apart, then they can make you go to biometric scans.
[02:35:09.501 --> 02:35:10.502]  That's the federal plan.
[02:35:11.102 --> 02:35:18.583]  But the point is, you put these inside these little holders that have got lead in them, but they're very lightweight, and it blocks it 100%.
[02:35:18.883 --> 02:35:21.604]  So thieves and government can't just drive around stealing your info.
[02:35:22.324 --> 02:35:26.706]  They have leather wallets, passport holders, cell phone pouches to protect your information.
[02:35:26.946 --> 02:35:28.026]  People can hack into those.
[02:35:28.587 --> 02:35:32.488]  IDStronghold, just the letter IDStronghold.com.
[02:35:33.729 --> 02:35:37.551]  And they've got a bunch of specials running as well.
[02:35:37.791 --> 02:35:39.531]  You will not find a better price anywhere.
[02:35:39.691 --> 02:35:41.012]  IDStronghold.com.
[02:35:41.032 --> 02:35:42.032]  They are the leaders.
[02:35:42.313 --> 02:35:43.593]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:35:43.733 --> 02:35:45.494]  IDStronghold.com.
[02:35:45.834 --> 02:35:47.395]  Okay, going back to Joel Scalson.
[02:35:47.415 --> 02:35:49.776]  We've got a lot of news to cover in a short time to get there.
[02:35:53.105 --> 02:35:56.829]  You were telling us about Glenn Beck and what you felt is going to go on there.
[02:35:57.270 --> 02:35:59.972]  Well, I don't feel it, unfortunately.
[02:35:59.992 --> 02:36:04.417]  In fact, I wish, Joel, because I wasn't clear.
[02:36:04.497 --> 02:36:08.060]  I wish it was just my feelings or my speculation.
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:13.466]  A very high-powered reporter, and I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:36:15.168 --> 02:36:15.488]  Hold on.
[02:36:30.154 --> 02:36:32.356]  Group of information breaking about Glenn Beck.
[02:36:32.776 --> 02:36:35.478]  You've noticed he's been saying something big's about to come out.
[02:36:35.518 --> 02:36:37.540]  So I can talk about it because he knows.
[02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:41.043]  He doesn't know the full extent, though, from what I've been told by a very good source.
[02:36:41.803 --> 02:36:43.765]  He said, you know, bad things are about to come out.
[02:36:43.785 --> 02:36:44.446]  They're not true.
[02:36:44.866 --> 02:36:46.107]  I don't know if it's true or not.
[02:36:47.428 --> 02:36:51.872]  But I think if it is true, the system knew he had problems from the beginning.
[02:36:52.981 --> 02:36:55.384]  Things that are even worse than we know, the drugs and the rest of it.
[02:36:56.005 --> 02:37:00.551]  And so they built him up as the figurehead of this movement to then try to discredit it.
[02:37:00.951 --> 02:37:07.580]  I don't think that's going to work, but you talking about them coming after him, that's what spurred me to say, yeah, you're right.
[02:37:08.221 --> 02:37:10.925]  What's your take on that, Joel Skelson?
[02:37:11.837 --> 02:37:13.299]  Well, I have long suspected that.
[02:37:13.359 --> 02:37:31.639]  I don't have the sources that you have quoted, but I just have had a gut feeling that they're not... The sooner and the closer that Glenn Becks gets to the truth about a major issue of powerful forces controlling our government, powerful forces controlling both political parties,
[02:37:32.359 --> 02:37:32.639]  Well,
[02:37:55.543 --> 02:38:08.167]  My issue is, you know, he represents, whether it's true or not, a lot of the Liberty Movement, the Awakening, and I just hope the things I've heard... And again, this was from a high-powered reporter.
[02:38:08.187 --> 02:38:09.668]  I mean, this is from as big as it gets.
[02:38:10.708 --> 02:38:18.131]  And, you know, as I reach more people and become more prominent, I get these sources, and this... I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:38:18.151 --> 02:38:19.071]  I'm not going to talk about it.
[02:38:19.131 --> 02:38:21.332]  I'm not going to give out any information.
[02:38:21.852 --> 02:38:23.313]  Glenn Beck already knows about it.
[02:38:24.273 --> 02:38:26.775]  Uh, he already knows about, well, that's it.
[02:38:26.795 --> 02:38:27.595]  I'm shutting up now.
[02:38:28.276 --> 02:38:29.857]  It's just that Glenn Beck better get ready.
[02:38:30.157 --> 02:38:30.877]  He better get ready.
[02:38:31.257 --> 02:38:35.020]  I hope this stuff isn't true, but he better get ready because it's real.
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:39.422]  Uh, and, uh, it is going to be crippling, uh, at the bare minimum.
[02:38:41.727 --> 02:38:46.089]  I will say this, you know, three months ago I say talk about poison in the water, talk about eugenics.
[02:38:46.129 --> 02:38:46.549]  He does it.
[02:38:47.129 --> 02:38:51.851]  I say talk about the real puppet masters two weeks ago, not just George Soros.
[02:38:52.151 --> 02:38:59.954]  He comes out last week and talks about David Rockefeller and how robber barons are not free market and want socialism.
[02:39:00.454 --> 02:39:05.116]  So it does seem like just a few months ago he seemed disingenuous.
[02:39:05.176 --> 02:39:10.138]  More and more I think he realizes that his time may be limited, Joel.
[02:39:11.294 --> 02:39:15.117]  Well, and if this does come to pass, then I think it's only a matter of time.
[02:39:16.357 --> 02:39:20.620]  Whether they fabricate something or they blow something out of proportion, or even if it's true,
[02:39:22.492 --> 02:39:28.695]  He's going to know for sure, after being targeted himself, that there's a major conspiracy to shut down the truth in this country.
[02:39:28.916 --> 02:39:33.198]  And what he does with it afterwards remains to be seen, you know?
[02:39:33.698 --> 02:39:43.363]  If they throw him off that network, I am sure there are other networks, even your own, that might pick him up or that might help him out, and he could continue to have a voice.
[02:39:43.403 --> 02:39:44.864]  Well, the guy's worth like $150 million.
[02:39:45.244 --> 02:39:46.365]  He can start his own network.
[02:39:46.685 --> 02:39:47.045]  That's right.
[02:39:47.125 --> 02:39:47.926]  He does have the money.
[02:39:47.966 --> 02:39:49.427]  He's got a tremendous amount of money.
[02:39:49.887 --> 02:39:51.408]  And there are some other struggling networks.
[02:40:00.864 --> 02:40:06.889]  Well, you know, again, I don't think it should be about the personal things that a messenger is involved in.
[02:40:06.929 --> 02:40:08.390]  It should be about the information.
[02:40:08.931 --> 02:40:18.699]  But the system wants to change the debate, and instead of making it about the message, about the messenger, and I'm done talking about Beck, it just really shook me up.
[02:40:20.236 --> 02:40:34.170]  What I learned is going on and it's it's it's just and and and you know you think at a primitive level I'd be like oh good he's ripped off my material he's demonized me you know he's done these things in the years past but I'm really feel sick and
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:36.641]  Well, I'm done talking about it.
[02:40:36.681 --> 02:40:37.421]  It just makes more sense.
[02:40:37.441 --> 02:40:48.087]  It's to your credit, Alex, if I could say, though, that, you know, as I've seen the competition and the back and forth going on, it's to your credit that you've accepted the good things that Glenn Beck does.
[02:40:48.347 --> 02:40:53.590]  You know, I was a very strong critic of Glenn Beck when he started, especially when he denigrated conspiracies so strongly.
[02:40:54.011 --> 02:41:02.456]  But I, too, have had to acknowledge that Glenn Beck has done a great deal of good for the movement, and the powers that be cannot stand that for long.
[02:41:02.476 --> 02:41:04.657]  And that's why we're all eventually targeted.
[02:41:05.382 --> 02:41:09.570]  But especially those that have a strong forefront like Glenn Beckerson.
[02:41:10.131 --> 02:41:11.251]  Well, I agree with you, though.
[02:41:11.271 --> 02:41:15.293]  I think he's really going to find out just how ruthless these people are.
[02:41:15.313 --> 02:41:21.455]  And I just thank God every day that I don't have any real skeletons in my closet.
[02:41:21.515 --> 02:41:24.856]  What, I got in fights and beat people up pretty bad when they started fights with me?
[02:41:24.916 --> 02:41:26.956]  What, I smoked marijuana a couple times?
[02:41:26.996 --> 02:41:29.437]  I mean, thank God I've had a pretty clean life.
[02:41:30.257 --> 02:41:33.178]  But I have to tell my wife, I go, you know, it doesn't matter.
[02:41:33.238 --> 02:41:34.839]  They still might manufacture something.
[02:41:35.159 --> 02:41:37.940]  I mean, this could be totally manufactured, what they're about to do to him.
[02:41:39.639 --> 02:41:43.863]  Well, you know, that's the interesting thing about the story about Lord James that comes out.
[02:41:43.883 --> 02:41:48.829]  The things that he said, for example, this is the quote he said, I found myself between a rock and a hard place.
[02:41:49.369 --> 02:41:51.331]  That they were totally paranoid about each other.
[02:41:51.351 --> 02:41:54.535]  He's talking about Foundation X and the Bank of England.
[02:41:55.095 --> 02:42:01.219]  Now, we tend to think of these things as totally unanimous organizations, that there's absolute control between them, but they're not.
[02:42:01.259 --> 02:42:04.902]  They're competing power structures, even within the powers that be.
[02:42:05.442 --> 02:42:09.865]  Because the Foundation X people are super obsessed about their own security.
[02:42:10.846 --> 02:42:14.729]  They expect to be contacted only by someone equal to heads of state,
[02:42:21.468 --> 02:42:22.609]  By the way, let me stop you.
[02:42:22.629 --> 02:42:28.717]  You're quoting him, and I'm not going to play the whole 12-minute video, but it's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:42:28.737 --> 02:42:29.798]  It's been up there for a few weeks.
[02:42:30.098 --> 02:42:32.681]  Let's put it back on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:42:33.262 --> 02:42:35.304]  If folks want to go watch this on YouTube,
[02:42:36.025 --> 02:42:37.786]  It's only got like 9,000 views.
[02:42:37.866 --> 02:42:39.127]  It should have 10 million views.
[02:42:39.427 --> 02:42:46.990]  It's Lord James of Blackheath speaks of Foundation X. Here he is talking about Bilderberg Group level.
[02:42:47.390 --> 02:42:48.611]  That's what Foundation X is, folks.
[02:42:48.991 --> 02:42:54.614]  Here he is talking about Henry Kissinger, world government, secretive groups, governments funding terrorists.
[02:42:54.934 --> 02:42:58.556]  And again, you can just search that on YouTube and pull it up.
[02:42:58.616 --> 02:43:04.999]  Lord James of Blackheath speaks of Foundation X. And that's my next question, Joel.
[02:43:05.939 --> 02:43:11.563]  Clearly, and Bob Chapman and others agree with me on this, I want to see if you agree, the globalists are getting into this final phase.
[02:43:11.583 --> 02:43:24.572]  There's always been fissures, there's always been infighting over the levers of power, but now that's being accelerated, accentuated, because in the final phases of consolidation, things are getting more and more hectic, more and more dangerous.
[02:43:24.912 --> 02:43:29.435]  A lot of people inside the system are starting to bulk when they really see what's being built.
[02:43:29.895 --> 02:43:35.359]  A lot of people in government don't want to allow, you know, this nuking of the United States.
[02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:51.492]  There is a lot of truth to that because, as I pointed out in my book, Strategic Relocation, where I put out my major theory about how a conspiracy of power works in the various different levels, they don't tell, you know, there aren't thousands of people that know the whole plan.
[02:43:51.512 --> 02:44:03.002]  There are an awful lot of people at the lower levels who are predictable yes-men, who are predictable liberals, who are soft-brained people, or people who are just greedy for political or financial power that don't know.
[02:44:03.891 --> 02:44:09.916]  What the full plan is of destruction, of killing of billions of people through biological and chemical warfare, of nuclear war.
[02:44:10.216 --> 02:44:12.518]  They don't know, and they're starting to find out.
[02:44:12.959 --> 02:44:13.719]  And they're bulking.
[02:44:14.340 --> 02:44:20.205]  Now that's why I believe that Foundation X is not one of the organizations that we normally know about.
[02:44:20.245 --> 02:44:21.606]  It's not Committee of 300.
[02:44:22.066 --> 02:44:23.067]  It's not Bilderberger.
[02:44:23.287 --> 02:44:24.408]  It's not Aspen Institute.
[02:44:24.448 --> 02:44:26.370]  It's not Trilaterals, although they're part of it.
[02:44:27.435 --> 02:44:33.824]  I'm saying, I think the very top levels keep themselves out of those visible organizations.
[02:44:34.004 --> 02:44:37.749]  And that's why they're paranoid, as you said, about their security.
[02:44:38.050 --> 02:44:41.374]  Sure, but they've got representatives in all those key meetings.
[02:44:41.674 --> 02:44:42.255]  Absolutely.
[02:44:42.315 --> 02:44:43.978]  These people all work for them.
[02:44:44.578 --> 02:44:47.300]  But not necessarily all in a unanimous team.
[02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:54.186]  I think sometimes they feed different power groups and power sub-leaders who have their own powers.
[02:44:54.206 --> 02:44:55.487]  Sure, they're steering things.
[02:44:55.527 --> 02:44:56.448]  They don't have total control.
[02:44:56.468 --> 02:44:57.288]  They're able to steer.
[02:44:57.548 --> 02:45:01.291]  So from your deep research, tell us who's at the top.
[02:45:01.331 --> 02:45:06.956]  From my research, it's Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Sachs-Coburg, Gothas, the British and Dutch royalty.
[02:45:06.976 --> 02:45:10.499]  I mean, it's really the robber baron families.
[02:45:11.377 --> 02:45:11.898]  Yeah, it is.
[02:45:12.138 --> 02:45:16.162]  I think, you know, you've got to remember that there's movement also in these hierarchies.
[02:45:16.202 --> 02:45:18.465]  There's people who die off and people who replace them.
[02:45:19.106 --> 02:45:22.590]  I'm convinced that Henry Kissinger has moved up into the top levels now.
[02:45:23.681 --> 02:45:27.964]  Yes, because people die and then only a few people know where all the bodies are buried.
[02:45:28.585 --> 02:45:29.065]  That's right.
[02:45:29.225 --> 02:45:29.586]  That's right.
[02:45:29.686 --> 02:45:31.987]  I think George Soros has moved up to the top.
[02:45:32.088 --> 02:45:35.310]  I think Dwayne Andreas, you know, was there.
[02:45:36.331 --> 02:45:38.773]  So, you know, none of us are ever going to know completely.
[02:45:38.873 --> 02:45:42.075]  And in fact, it isn't necessary to even know who it is.
[02:45:42.235 --> 02:45:44.197]  We have to teach people to watch
[02:45:45.245 --> 02:45:47.206]  The power structure at work.
[02:45:47.806 --> 02:45:53.608]  You know, just like Chuck Bolden said one time, he said, you know, I don't know if the Antichrist is a person or an organization.
[02:45:53.988 --> 02:45:55.109]  It doesn't make any difference.
[02:45:55.229 --> 02:45:58.630]  All I do know, he said, is that it is going to have an effect.
[02:45:58.770 --> 02:46:02.952]  It's targeting us, our liberty, and our lives, and that's what we need to be
[02:46:04.861 --> 02:46:05.641]  Very well said.
[02:46:05.661 --> 02:46:09.422]  In closing, Joel, and things are moving so quick, I want to have you back up very, very soon.
[02:46:09.442 --> 02:46:14.624]  Any other points you want to add about what's happening in our world?
[02:46:14.644 --> 02:46:21.806]  Do you think it's overall a positive thing that we are rebelling against the TSA and the people are learning the power that they do have?
[02:46:22.666 --> 02:46:23.206]  Absolutely.
[02:46:23.887 --> 02:46:34.832]  The great positive is that the more, you know, ultimately there are those who understand and who acquiesce, and those who understand that there is conspiracy and will not acquiesce.
[02:46:35.513 --> 02:46:42.496]  And we're starting to see stronger people come out, especially against TSA, and say, we're not going to take this anymore, and they really mean it.
[02:46:42.857 --> 02:46:45.478]  We're not going to fly, like Jesse Ventura says.
[02:46:45.518 --> 02:46:47.399]  We're not going to, you know, stand for this.
[02:46:48.206 --> 02:46:52.269]  And I think we need to, that builds confidence in other people to take a stand.
[02:46:52.449 --> 02:47:06.057]  That's what I worried about so much in this movement, is that there are a lot of people who felt and agreed with us, but weren't willing to take a stand someday and actually stand up against it with force of arms if necessary.
[02:47:06.477 --> 02:47:10.743]  Well, I want to quantify that and then have you elaborate briefly because we're almost out of time.
[02:47:11.424 --> 02:47:13.808]  There's a greater risk in not getting in the game.
[02:47:13.828 --> 02:47:17.053]  There's a greater risk in being passive and sitting on the bench.
[02:47:17.653 --> 02:47:20.938]  That assures the victory of these eugenics control freaks.
[02:47:21.759 --> 02:47:22.920]  People think I have courage.
[02:47:22.940 --> 02:47:23.740]  I don't have courage.
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:33.826]  I'm doing this because I've studied history, and I know these tyrants have got to be met head-on, because if they succeed, then our destruction and enslavement is assured.
[02:47:34.066 --> 02:47:37.088]  The only way out is standing up, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:38.388 --> 02:47:39.749]  Joel, your comments on that statement.
[02:47:40.930 --> 02:47:41.790]  That's exactly right.
[02:47:42.070 --> 02:47:44.652]  One thing I learned from the statements of Lord James was this.
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:52.787]  He estimated that almost half of the House of Lords already knew about this foundation, and that it was a new thing to him.
[02:47:52.807 --> 02:47:56.770]  Now that, and the same thing with this guy in the City of London.
[02:47:56.811 --> 02:48:04.678]  Remember, he was the only one out of the 30 or 40 people he regularly met with, high financiers who didn't know about the system.
[02:48:05.316 --> 02:48:08.058]  That means it's much bigger than we thought.
[02:48:08.479 --> 02:48:10.981]  It's much more deeply ingrained in the power structure.
[02:48:11.401 --> 02:48:21.389]  And it's only an enraged populace that is going to scare them into saying, hey, you know, if enough of these people really get disturbed, we could be in trouble.
[02:48:21.990 --> 02:48:23.511]  We could be physically at risk.
[02:48:24.136 --> 02:48:28.238]  From the kind of irritation we're seeing against TSA, and I want them to think that.
[02:48:28.659 --> 02:48:30.059]  Well, I... Go ahead.
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:46.569]  No, I mean, they've got to stay hidden, because as they engineer these calamities, you know, they can flush presidents down the toilet, the CFR down the toilet, whole countries down, but if people ever identify the true ruling class, then they can't carry out the carnage, because they will get the blame.
[02:48:47.470 --> 02:48:48.970]  Not only that, and they could be targeted.
[02:48:49.911 --> 02:48:53.253]  You know, there are people out there who say, if we ever find out who they are,
[02:48:54.261 --> 02:48:55.604]  Their lives aren't worth much.
[02:48:56.305 --> 02:48:57.727]  And they need to be afraid of that.
[02:48:58.008 --> 02:49:02.275]  Because someday, you know, people are not going to take this lie down.
[02:49:02.295 --> 02:49:07.565]  When you nuke a nation, and when you destroy and kill millions of people, you lose your right to live.
[02:49:08.962 --> 02:49:17.164]  And so we need to have this testament on the line right now about who Foundation X is, this nexus of the super groups, because that's checkmate.
[02:49:17.244 --> 02:49:20.865]  If we start identifying them, and I'm getting chill bumps right now, this is dangerous to do, folks.
[02:49:21.465 --> 02:49:30.948]  As we identify the true rulers and not their puppets, then that begins to remove their power to act on their agenda because they know they'll be brought to justice.
[02:49:31.803 --> 02:49:36.085]  That's right, and one of the greatest things we need to do is encourage whistleblowers to come forward.
[02:49:36.405 --> 02:49:41.067]  You know, there's over a hundred people who placed explosives in the World Trade Center who haven't talked yet.
[02:49:41.847 --> 02:49:48.490]  We need to have some of those people have the courage to come out and talk, and the only way they'll do is to realize that the powers that be might be threatened.
[02:49:49.451 --> 02:49:54.593]  Because they're looking at threats from both sides, and they have to say, look, I don't want to be a part of this anymore.
[02:49:56.783 --> 02:50:00.931]  Well, I would imagine most of those hundred have already been killed, but that's a good point.
[02:50:00.971 --> 02:50:04.197]  Joel Skousen, worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:50:04.257 --> 02:50:05.038]  Thank you so much.
[02:50:05.078 --> 02:50:06.220]  We'll talk to you again very soon.
[02:50:06.823 --> 02:50:07.884]  Pleasure, Alex, as always.
[02:50:08.124 --> 02:50:08.964]  Pleasure talking to you.
[02:50:09.004 --> 02:50:10.865]  I've got some key financial news I want to hit.
[02:50:11.245 --> 02:50:12.326]  Jaren did find it.
[02:50:12.346 --> 02:50:14.127]  This is the report I saw two weeks ago.
[02:50:14.147 --> 02:50:19.750]  I'm going to get Kurt Nemo, Steve Watson, Paul Watson, or Aaron Dykes to do a report on this at InfoWars.com.
[02:50:20.150 --> 02:50:22.631]  All of you other news people are welcome to pick it up as well.
[02:50:22.691 --> 02:50:23.332]  It's big news.
[02:50:23.852 --> 02:50:27.194]  Special Climate Change Program 2009-2012 Mexico Executive Summary written by the UN.
[02:50:32.455 --> 02:50:44.119]  And it says on page six, relocate human settlements and infrastructure in high-risk areas and the implementation of policies aimed at climate stability and sustainable development.
[02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:50.262]  So it says the implementation of relocation programs of human settlements and infrastructure in high-risk areas.
[02:50:51.242 --> 02:50:51.742]  There you go.
[02:50:51.782 --> 02:50:52.602]  Relocation.
[02:50:52.743 --> 02:50:56.384]  Forcible relocation to areas in the name of the environment.
[02:50:56.444 --> 02:50:57.964]  Forcing you to move where they say.
[02:50:58.325 --> 02:50:59.065]  That's big news.
[02:50:59.986 --> 02:51:03.267]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:04.067 --> 02:51:08.309]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:08.569 --> 02:51:14.511]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:14.731 --> 02:51:16.892]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:17.172 --> 02:51:23.134]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.

[02:51:59.417 --> 02:52:04.281]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:04.401 --> 02:52:05.161]  What have we got?
[02:52:05.381 --> 02:52:07.503]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:07.843 --> 02:52:08.564]  A republic.
[02:52:08.844 --> 02:52:11.426]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:11.486 --> 02:52:13.387]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:13.748 --> 02:52:15.669]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:15.769 --> 02:52:17.050]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:17.470 --> 02:52:18.571]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:18.771 --> 02:52:19.172]  Children?
[02:52:19.392 --> 02:52:20.172]  Our education?
[02:52:20.513 --> 02:52:21.133]  Our money?
[02:52:21.333 --> 02:52:24.996]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:25.356 --> 02:52:29.982]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:30.322 --> 02:52:31.143]  We have the facts.
[02:52:31.343 --> 02:52:32.464]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:32.504 --> 02:52:33.386]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:33.406 --> 02:52:34.247]  We have common law.
[02:52:34.307 --> 02:52:36.549]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:52:45.657 --> 02:52:47.037]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:47.158 --> 02:52:47.998]  Don't tread on me.

[02:53:53.362 --> 02:53:57.205]  And click on CBS TV News, Missouri, the fountain of youth facelift.
[02:54:08.697 --> 02:54:09.978]  Think of the magnitude of this.
[02:54:10.078 --> 02:54:11.760]  Special Climate Change Program.
[02:54:11.780 --> 02:54:15.523]  2009-2012 Mexico Executive Summary.
[02:54:15.803 --> 02:54:19.065]  This is for the entire planet, but it deals with the Mexico Summit.
[02:54:20.006 --> 02:54:21.427]  It's got all the UN programs.
[02:54:22.789 --> 02:54:26.952]  It's got the globalfederal.gop.mexico.
[02:54:27.432 --> 02:54:28.533]  Global federal!
[02:54:28.833 --> 02:54:29.494]  It says right here.
[02:54:31.676 --> 02:54:34.938]  Globalfederal.gob.
[02:54:35.059 --> 02:54:35.819]  Global government.
[02:54:35.899 --> 02:54:36.540]  Global federal.
[02:54:37.827 --> 02:54:40.709]  It's just all out in the open, and they tell the public, oh, that doesn't exist.
[02:54:41.009 --> 02:54:43.030]  Hey, the TSA's sticking their hand down my pants.
[02:54:43.370 --> 02:54:44.651]  Oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[02:54:45.311 --> 02:54:54.336]  And it says they will relocate populations, livestock, agriculture, to any area they see fit, starting in 2013.
[02:54:55.176 --> 02:54:57.077]  I think it's pretty big news.
[02:54:57.178 --> 02:54:58.358]  Yeah, they're going to relocate you.
[02:54:59.759 --> 02:55:01.340]  These people don't play games, folks.
[02:55:01.900 --> 02:55:02.861]  They don't play games.
[02:55:04.062 --> 02:55:06.723]  I wanted to briefly bring Ted Anderson up here at the end of this hour.
[02:55:06.783 --> 02:55:07.963]  I'm sorry to all the callers.
[02:55:08.043 --> 02:55:08.764]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:55:08.784 --> 02:55:09.224]  We'll get to you.
[02:55:09.244 --> 02:55:11.965]  I apologize to George, John, Brenda, Marty, Rhonda, and others.
[02:55:12.385 --> 02:55:13.845]  But we're trying to get to more calls here.
[02:55:14.706 --> 02:55:16.686]  Just how could you go to calls when Joel Skousen was on?
[02:55:17.547 --> 02:55:18.627]  Gold's back up again today.
[02:55:18.647 --> 02:55:19.707]  They've been trying to suppress it.
[02:55:19.767 --> 02:55:21.088]  Silver back up again today.
[02:55:21.808 --> 02:55:23.168]  But it's going to start running back up.
[02:55:23.489 --> 02:55:26.590]  Ted was able to buy when it was low again and pass those savings on to you.
[02:55:27.010 --> 02:55:28.730]  He's got quite a few specials for you.
[02:55:29.471 --> 02:55:33.052]  Today we've got the FBI raiding hedge funds amid insider trading cases.
[02:55:33.612 --> 02:55:38.254]  But they're going after smaller firms instead of the big mega firms that are really involved in the corruption.
[02:55:38.815 --> 02:55:41.816]  Ted, tell us what's going on in financial markets with gold and silver.
[02:55:42.196 --> 02:55:43.317]  Well, that's a big one right there.
[02:55:43.357 --> 02:55:45.638]  The FBI going after hedge funds.
[02:55:45.678 --> 02:55:47.239]  And then, of course, gold may climb.
[02:55:47.299 --> 02:55:51.001]  Speculation on weaker dollar, which is a headline from Bloomberg.
[02:55:51.041 --> 02:55:51.681]  Here's another one.
[02:55:51.701 --> 02:55:55.083]  Bloomberg silver sales surge as investors seek protection.
[02:55:56.143 --> 02:56:00.005]  I mean, come on, we have European countries that are falling apart right now.
[02:56:00.385 --> 02:56:02.667]  The United States is on the brink of disaster.
[02:56:02.687 --> 02:56:05.388]  I mean, what more do you need?
[02:56:05.448 --> 02:56:07.069]  I mean, gold and silver is going up.
[02:56:07.489 --> 02:56:09.930]  Right now silver is at, well it's seen a high today of $27.73.
[02:56:09.970 --> 02:56:11.131]  Currently right now at $27.67.
[02:56:11.191 --> 02:56:12.231]  Gold is high now at $13.64.
[02:56:12.271 --> 02:56:12.231]  $13.90.
[02:56:12.291 --> 02:56:12.632]  And right now $13.61.
[02:56:12.672 --> 02:56:13.072]  Alex, there's a
[02:56:21.576 --> 02:56:23.577]  A wide array of specials that we have.
[02:56:24.097 --> 02:56:26.698]  Again, the very best special that we have is your videos.
[02:56:27.758 --> 02:56:30.439]  If you want to know what's going on in the world, look at Alex's videos.
[02:56:30.499 --> 02:56:31.359]  Pass these things out.
[02:56:31.860 --> 02:56:34.501]  You've got silver dollars, basically, at your cost.
[02:56:34.541 --> 02:56:40.043]  Three silver dollars, and then you get free shipping and three of my most powerful films on top of it for, what, $101?
[02:56:41.343 --> 02:56:42.644]  No, no, we've dropped that price.
[02:56:42.724 --> 02:56:44.304]  Ninety-seven, even though silver's up.
[02:56:44.765 --> 02:56:46.586]  So we brought our price down, silver's up.
[02:56:46.606 --> 02:56:50.447]  For ninety-seven dollars, you get the three videos, the three silver dollars.
[02:56:50.507 --> 02:56:51.808]  Ninety-seven, it's a great buy.
[02:56:51.848 --> 02:56:54.049]  And the shipping's included in that.
[02:56:54.069 --> 02:56:54.709]  Oh, yeah.
[02:56:54.729 --> 02:56:54.769]  800-686-2237.
[02:56:54.789 --> 02:56:56.550]  800-686-2237.
[02:56:56.670 --> 02:57:03.874]  And if you want to get your friends and family into precious metals, call and get them a fifth ounce Frank Gold coin.
[02:57:04.214 --> 02:57:07.215]  Get them a one ounce Gold Eagle or Buffalo.
[02:57:08.436 --> 02:57:10.978]  And once they hold it in their hand, they'll understand real money.
[02:57:10.998 --> 02:57:20.066]  Or, you know, buy silver dollars or silver half dollars for stocking stuffers and then educate people about real money while you do it this holiday season.
[02:57:20.426 --> 02:57:24.629]  And also expose, you know, how the big banks are trying to suppress the price.
[02:57:24.990 --> 02:57:28.893]  When you actually physically buy it, it makes it harder for them to continue to suppress it.
[02:57:28.913 --> 02:57:28.953]  800-686-2237.
[02:57:28.973 --> 02:57:29.333]  But Ted...
[02:57:32.836 --> 02:57:45.170]  For folks that want to get silver half dollars, that want to get francs, that want to get sovereigns, you know, the radio specials that are the lowest price you'll find anywhere that I've seen on gold and silver, tell folks briefly about a few of those coins you've got.
[02:57:45.532 --> 02:57:46.032]  Yeah, sure.
[02:57:46.052 --> 02:57:48.134]  You're talking about that fifth of an ounce franc coin.
[02:57:48.174 --> 02:57:49.374]  That's at $2.94.
[02:57:49.795 --> 02:57:51.936]  Walking Liberty Halves right now are at $12.84.
[02:57:51.996 --> 02:57:55.518]  Those prices have gone over $15 on the internet.
[02:57:56.399 --> 02:57:58.180]  Just pretty much everything across the board.
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:00.401]  You know, Alex, I need to come up with some more specials.
[02:58:00.421 --> 02:58:03.443]  I know I've got a ton of them out there and people sort of lose track of them.
[02:58:03.683 --> 02:58:09.367]  But yeah, if you pick up one British Sovereign, you're going to get five videos from Alex Jones.
[02:58:10.167 --> 02:58:11.707]  That's another one that we have.
[02:58:11.787 --> 02:58:13.528]  There's just a wide array of things.
[02:58:13.568 --> 02:58:15.228]  You can see what's going on economically.
[02:58:15.628 --> 02:58:19.329]  Why not have the coins that our forefathers intended for us to have?
[02:58:19.369 --> 02:58:20.549]  Yeah, well, let me just add this.
[02:58:20.629 --> 02:58:21.589]  Absolutely, Ted, at the end.
[02:58:22.009 --> 02:58:23.070]  Coin shops all over.
[02:58:23.150 --> 02:58:24.090]  Dallas, Austin.
[02:58:24.650 --> 02:58:25.210]  I've talked to people.
[02:58:25.230 --> 02:58:26.130]  They're all sold out.
[02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:27.791]  They have almost nothing or nothing.
[02:58:27.971 --> 02:58:29.031]  And there's huge premiums.
[02:58:29.331 --> 02:58:32.111]  Ted's got it on hand, ready to ship it to you today.
[02:58:32.131 --> 02:58:32.171]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:32.191 --> 02:58:36.492]  Key info coming up.
[02:58:36.512 --> 02:58:38.253]  The retransmission at InfoWars.com.
