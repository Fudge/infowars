[00:00:01.923 --> 00:00:11.909]  We're going to Wayne Madsen here in just a moment, and then into big news blitz coming up in the next hour while a guest joins us on a host of issues.
[00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:18.693]  But before I go any further, I want to thank the sponsors that make this radio show and everything else we do possible.
[00:00:18.773 --> 00:00:20.634]  One of them is efoodsdirect.com.
[00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:25.637]  Non-hybrid, non-GMO food, all grown right here in America except for the bananas.
[00:00:26.457 --> 00:00:26.537]  Yeah.
[00:00:46.852 --> 00:00:49.273]  Ahead of this depression, have storable food.
[00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:51.695]  And if you end up not needing it, you can eat your investment.
[00:00:52.736 --> 00:00:54.096]  It's high-quality, tasty food.
[00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:56.017]  They've got a bunch of different important food lines.
[00:00:56.378 --> 00:00:57.138]  So just check it out.
[00:00:57.238 --> 00:01:01.941]  It's efoodsdirect.com, the letter E, foodsdirect.com, banners up on infowars.com.

[00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:08.405]  800-409-5633 to get a free brochure.
[00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:12.867]  And one other sponsor I want to tell you about is Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:01:13.528 --> 00:01:15.009]  Made in America.
[00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.431]  You've heard their catchy jingle that everyone around the office sings.
[00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:28.634]  Because a lot of people have the show on and I can walk from office to office during breaks from room to room and hear basically everyone singing the jingle.
[00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:31.035]  But they're made in America.
[00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:34.657]  They got motorcycle jeans, regular jeans, a whole bunch of other great stuff.
[00:01:35.217 --> 00:01:37.598]  And you want to check them out at gussetclothing.com.
[00:01:37.658 --> 00:01:39.719]  Gusset spelled G-U-S-S-E-T.
[00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.399]  gussetclothing.com.
[00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:54.000]  And these things are double sewn in the crotch because that's where my jeans always seem to tear out when I pick up a box or something if they're Levi's made overseas.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.861]  Gussetclothing.com
[00:01:56.994 --> 00:01:59.836]  They sew a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:01.937]  Blue diamond gusset.
[00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:03.318]  Gussets got it.
[00:02:03.878 --> 00:02:04.519]  Others don't.
[00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.979]  All right.
[00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.060]  Now I'm going to start.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.802]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:02:10.242 --> 00:02:13.004]  I was at my mother's house yesterday.
[00:02:13.044 --> 00:02:13.704]  I dropped by.
[00:02:13.724 --> 00:02:15.465]  I dropped my children off.
[00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:16.526]  I took my wife out to dinner.
[00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:19.608]  And my mother had the rebroadcast on in the house.
[00:02:19.648 --> 00:02:23.370]  And as I walk in the door, she's singing the Blue Diamond Gusset song.
[00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.591]  OK, I'm going to shut up.
[00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:25.832]  It's just it's the most
[00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:30.358]  The most catchy jingle I've ever heard.
[00:02:30.378 --> 00:02:31.559]  I've got to say that.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.385]  Getting into more serious subjects, I want to get into his inside investigation on what's really happening with BP.
[00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:42.608]  Will you guys reprint me the Curt Nemo article?
[00:02:42.648 --> 00:02:51.835]  I know you did, but I can't find it, about CBS News reporting that BP contractors won't let people on public beaches to videotape the oil.
[00:02:52.595 --> 00:02:55.758]  This is an example of martial law and tyranny violating the press.
[00:02:55.778 --> 00:02:57.400]  This is Obama's open press.
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.241]  We're going to talk about that.
[00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:10.612]  We're going to talk about the major political realignment with Specter going down, Grayson, the Republican, going down to Rand Paul, other Republican and Democrat establishment people going down.
[00:03:10.953 --> 00:03:15.257]  The media has framed this as if the Tea Party movement is an anti-Democrat thing.
[00:03:16.192 --> 00:03:22.006]  But Rick Perry, Senator Cornyn and others were booed a year and a half ago here in Texas at tea parties.
[00:03:22.707 --> 00:03:25.173]  But the media has tried to make it a Republican issue.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:51.162]  uh... so that uh... so-called left feels like they're not part of the political debate so they automatically are basically given the role of being pro-establishment when we're all in this together uh... so this this clearly shows a realignment and the system is panicking and they're trying to use ran paul as the figurehead to destroy him but as i told salon yesterday you are out of bullets in the mainstream media
[00:03:52.103 --> 00:03:56.924]  If you're an established Republican or Democrat, you are gone come November, Jones said.
[00:03:57.264 --> 00:04:04.426]  The good news is that people are coming in from both parties who have much better track records as constitutionalists and don't have these establishment pedigrees.
[00:04:04.846 --> 00:04:06.866]  He also warned the media against smearing Paul.
[00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:08.387]  The mainstream media doesn't understand.
[00:04:08.807 --> 00:04:09.607]  They are out of bullets.
[00:04:09.907 --> 00:04:14.028]  When the mainstream media wants to hurt Rand Paul, they should come out and endorse him.
[00:04:14.628 --> 00:04:17.490]  When the establishment attacks someone, it only empowers them.
[00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.733]  So we'll talk about that and what's happening in the markets with Wayne Madsen.
[00:04:22.773 --> 00:04:24.234]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[00:04:24.614 --> 00:04:27.275]  He's a D.C.-based investigative journalist, author, syndicate of columnists.
[00:04:27.295 --> 00:04:30.998]  He's written for The Village Voice, The Progressive, Counterpunch, Online Journal, CorpWatch.
[00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:35.300]  Multinational Monitor, News Leader, The Times, The American Conservative.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.123]  His columns have appeared in the Miami Herald, Houston Chronicle, Philadelphia Inquirer, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
[00:04:40.723 --> 00:04:47.967]  He wrote the Handbook of Personal Data Protection, Claim Reference Book on International Data Law, Genocide and Covered Operations in Africa.
[00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:50.368]  It just goes on and on.
[00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:55.251]  He's a regular contributor to ABC, NBC, Russia Today, Al Jazeera, CNN.
[00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:58.253]  He's been invited to testify as a witness before the U.S.
[00:04:58.273 --> 00:04:59.353]  House of Representatives, the U.N.
[00:04:59.373 --> 00:05:00.134]  Criminal Tribunal,
[00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:07.238]  And of course he worked with the NSA and a bunch of other federal agencies, the Naval Data Automated Command Department of State.
[00:05:07.518 --> 00:05:11.641]  So we've got him on for the next 25 minutes to go over all these subjects.
[00:05:11.961 --> 00:05:13.742]  Wayne Madsen, what do you want to get into first?
[00:05:13.762 --> 00:05:18.085]  Of the subjects I've mentioned that you've been reporting on, what do you think is most important?
[00:05:18.772 --> 00:05:38.471]  Well, I normally cover Inside the Beltway, Alex, but actually this week I'm in Chicago because there's just a lot of stories about our current president and his, for lack of a better term, his cronies that have just gone unreported by the Chicago papers, which have basically been decimated.
[00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:46.475]  I'm going to be intermittently now in Chicago from time to time to basically pick up the slack that the few investigative journalists
[00:05:57.881 --> 00:06:01.623]  He said he can't get to a lot of these stories, so I'm going to give him a hand.
[00:06:01.683 --> 00:06:09.848]  In just a few days I've been here, all I can say is the person who's in the White House, who we all see, is not the person who is the President.
[00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:10.849]  Believe you me.
[00:06:11.755 --> 00:06:23.079]  Well, I mean, weathermen, corrupt poverty pimps, slumlords, mafia, break down your research of Barack Obama.
[00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:28.520]  I mean, if this has got you out of D.C., in Chicago, we know this is big news.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.801]  What are you ferreting out on Obama?
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.182]  Well, let's just start with the Blagojevich trial.
[00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:47.026]  It's very clear that Blagojevich, like many of his predecessors as governors of Illinois, there's been many who have been indicted and many have gone to jail.
[00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:52.629]  Otto Kerner and Walker and even Blagojevich's predecessor, Republican George Ryan.
[00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:57.951]  But when we look at this case against Blagojevich, what we have is
[00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:00.654]  Patrick Fitzgerald, who's a dirty U.S.
[00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:14.213]  prosecuting attorney here in Illinois, cutting a deal with people like Rahm Emanuel and Obama, put the attention on Blagojevich, only concentrate on certain segments of
[00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:16.095]  I don't know.
[00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:39.031]  And Broadway Bank made the initial loan to Resco.
[00:07:39.071 --> 00:07:50.556]  We know that Resco put up the money for Obama to buy this $500,000 home in Hyde Park near the University of Chicago, which is not a bad section, by the way, of the South Side.
[00:07:50.896 --> 00:08:00.721]  So what we have is Resco being indicted, Blagojevich being indicted, and it's very clear to me that those indictments should have also been served to Rahm Emanuel.
[00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:12.488]  Barack Obama, and potentially an individual who voluntarily gave up her law license rather than face a major civil suit.
[00:08:12.548 --> 00:08:23.435]  The records of the Supreme Court of Illinois, the disciplinary board, have been sealed, and the person who voluntarily gave up her law license was Michelle Obama, First Lady.
[00:08:24.436 --> 00:08:26.557]  You just made me have a double-tick there.
[00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:33.232]  Did you say Rahm Emanuel and Obama, you believe, have been served secret indictments?
[00:08:33.693 --> 00:08:34.553]  They should be.
[00:08:34.794 --> 00:08:35.434]  They should be.
[00:08:35.854 --> 00:08:40.358]  But the concentration, of course, by Fitzgerald, who was kept on, Bush's U.S.
[00:08:40.438 --> 00:08:50.265]  attorney, has been on Blavish, Resco, and, you know, the fair game, when in fact there should be, if we had a decent U.S.
[00:08:50.345 --> 00:08:51.006]  attorney here in
[00:08:51.346 --> 00:08:52.086]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:09:13.932 --> 00:09:26.559]  All these people who are Obama's friends and cronies, and I should add that one of them, of course, is Elena Kagan, who now has been nominated for the Supreme Court.
[00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:35.704]  Did they choose Obama not just because he's good looking and can read off a teleprompter well, but because he's so compromised with all of these mafia connections?
[00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:38.023]  Well, he's totally blackmailed.
[00:09:38.063 --> 00:09:40.124]  We can look at history.
[00:09:40.424 --> 00:09:47.425]  You know, 10 years ago, Obama didn't have $10 in his pocket to put gas in the gas tank of his car.
[00:09:47.825 --> 00:09:49.866]  By the way, he had this car.
[00:09:50.306 --> 00:09:51.906]  It was sold on eBay.
[00:09:52.486 --> 00:09:55.587]  Apparently, it only had 22,000 miles on it.
[00:09:55.887 --> 00:10:03.849]  But even at 22,000 miles, apparently the tires were so beat up, I have to imagine this guy was peeling rubber on the streets of Chicago.
[00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:16.477]  Running around town, but you know, here's a guy who, he and his wife were being harassed by creditors, credit card collection agencies, and you know, they had three salaries.
[00:10:16.858 --> 00:10:24.163]  His is Illinois State Senator, his is a part-time professor at the University of Chicago, and her salary, and yet they couldn't make ends meet.
[00:10:24.323 --> 00:10:29.947]  I mean, if he couldn't pay his own bills then, maybe that's why he can't pay the country's bills today.
[00:10:31.633 --> 00:10:35.616]  Well, he's admitted to drug use, and there's a lot of evidence that he used a lot of hard drugs.
[00:10:35.636 --> 00:10:36.837]  Maybe that's why he didn't have money.
[00:10:37.918 --> 00:10:43.903]  Right, and also there are reports of other extracurricular activities he engaged in here.
[00:10:44.324 --> 00:10:54.833]  Well, Wayne, you've always got some of the best sources out there, and it would be a big blackmail tool, but I mean, is there credible evidence you're starting to run into that he is bisexual?
[00:10:56.321 --> 00:11:10.945]  Yes, and it's known here in Chicago, it's known among members of the African American community, and let's just say, I mean, where was the media?
[00:11:10.985 --> 00:11:20.007]  Unfortunately, the media, the Chicago media couldn't go very far on this because of what's happened to the, many of the reporters at the Chicago Tribune have been laid off because of this.
[00:11:20.427 --> 00:11:20.968]  Yes, we are.
[00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:29.480]  Basically up for grabs.
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.983]  They've gone through a huge reduction in staff.
[00:11:33.003 --> 00:11:36.305]  So you're there on this story, shifting gears again.
[00:11:37.126 --> 00:11:39.287]  What's the word in Washington on Elena Kagan?
[00:11:39.628 --> 00:11:50.696]  Is she just somebody they're throwing out there with no judicial experience, who's anti-free speech, anti-Second Amendment, knowing that she'll just take all the fire, and then who they really want will come in after her?
[00:11:51.096 --> 00:11:53.838]  Or do you think they're really this arrogant to try to put her in?
[00:11:54.577 --> 00:11:57.158]  No, because you see who they're lining up.
[00:11:57.198 --> 00:12:07.422]  They're lining up all the judicial experts and bar association cronies are all saying, oh, she's so wonderful.
[00:12:07.802 --> 00:12:08.883]  I think she's going to get in.
[00:12:08.923 --> 00:12:19.307]  But see, Lyndon Johnson put Abe Fortas on the court, but he had to finally step down because he got implicated in all kinds of scandals and crony deals.
[00:12:19.387 --> 00:12:23.249]  And she's involved with Goldman Sachs up to her eyebrows.
[00:12:24.056 --> 00:12:38.460]  Yeah, but see, they know that today you can't get rid of somebody on the court like they did eight quarters because once they're there now, you could get them for evidence of being an axe murderer and it would probably be impossible to get them off the court.
[00:12:39.918 --> 00:12:48.367]  Now, the media needs to go ahead and bring out the fact that she is a lesbian so that they can't use that against her for blackmail later.
[00:12:48.407 --> 00:12:52.171]  I mean, isn't it important for her to come out with her sexuality?
[00:12:52.191 --> 00:12:56.316]  I mean, how controlled is the media that only CBS News has reported on this?
[00:12:57.287 --> 00:13:04.490]  Yeah, I mean the media is totally controlled and you know the people in the legal community who are coming to her defense and praising her.
[00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.852]  Look, this is part of the whole inside the D.C.
[00:13:08.692 --> 00:13:09.393]  mentality.
[00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:12.334]  You know, you scratch my back, I scratch yours.
[00:13:12.454 --> 00:13:16.796]  And obviously this is what was going on here in Chicago with her here.
[00:13:20.318 --> 00:13:24.041]  She was associated with this city for many years, with the University of Chicago.
[00:13:24.061 --> 00:13:26.402]  She clerked for Abner McVin.
[00:13:26.643 --> 00:13:28.324]  You know, this U.S.
[00:13:28.384 --> 00:13:31.266]  judge, as far as they're concerned, here walks on water.
[00:13:31.326 --> 00:13:35.329]  So, you know, if he says she's good, you know, everybody falls into place.
[00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.632]  Okay, let's look at the economy.
[00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:45.856]  In free fall, markets down worldwide, the euro in danger of collapsing.
[00:13:46.597 --> 00:13:48.298]  What's your research on where this is going?
[00:13:49.394 --> 00:13:51.236]  Well, I think we're seeing a meltdown.
[00:13:52.477 --> 00:14:00.306]  Certainly, you know, we saw what happened in Thailand where there was a Tiananmen Square-style massacre.
[00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:06.793]  The farmers who came in were very upset about what's going on in that country with more money going to the elite.
[00:14:07.573 --> 00:14:20.038]  My prediction there is that Thailand will now be engaged in a full-scale civil war, with the have-nots going after the haves, especially in the smaller cities and in the rural areas.
[00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:23.679]  Greece, they're marching on the Parliament today.
[00:14:24.019 --> 00:14:25.740]  They again are trying to take it over.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:33.403]  The deals worked out with Spain and Portugal, and there was an attempt to storm the Irish Parliament a few weeks ago.
[00:14:34.383 --> 00:14:35.364]  I don't know.
[00:14:50.673 --> 00:14:53.136]  They should have heard it earlier on, but I think they're worried.
[00:14:53.196 --> 00:14:58.502]  I think the reason they're taking these actions is they're very worried about what they're seeing on the streets, you know?
[00:14:59.223 --> 00:15:02.646]  Shopping malls going up in flames in Bangkok.
[00:15:02.707 --> 00:15:04.208]  Banks being bombed in Athens.
[00:15:04.589 --> 00:15:09.414]  You know, people marching... Banks being bombed in Canada.
[00:15:09.554 --> 00:15:11.176]  Banks being firebombed in Canada.
[00:15:11.758 --> 00:15:12.398]  Right, right.
[00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:23.223]  And now we see the Gulf of Mexico turning into a dead zone, and I just wonder how long it's going to take for people to reach that level of frustration here.
[00:15:23.303 --> 00:15:36.788]  I would note that more people filed for unemployment last month than previously, so Obama's all his brouhaha about unemployment coming down is merely rhetoric and not even true.
[00:15:38.117 --> 00:15:47.463]  Well, going back to domestic developments, and we're going to come back and talk about your research and the story you've got out about BP and the admitted cover up there.
[00:15:47.503 --> 00:15:50.865]  I mean, every day they admit it was worse than what they had originally said, and they knowingly lied.
[00:15:51.626 --> 00:16:00.932]  But Rand Paul winning the primary in Kentucky by 30-plus points, the Republican incumbent losing in the primary in Utah, Specter going down.
[00:16:02.993 --> 00:16:09.036]  Zbigniew Brzezinski coming out on video and saying the world has never been this awake to our world government.
[00:16:09.316 --> 00:16:11.757]  We are in trouble to the CFR.
[00:16:12.357 --> 00:16:13.858]  I mean they are not invincible are they?
[00:16:14.984 --> 00:16:25.269]  No, and I think what they're saying, as I said, you know, when people are getting, you know, thousands, tens of thousands of people hit the streets, go on general strikes.
[00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.251]  We're seeing it all over Europe and Asia.
[00:16:30.112 --> 00:16:35.534]  We remember the food riots a few years ago popping up in places like Haiti and in Africa.
[00:16:35.594 --> 00:16:36.975]  We may see that happen again.
[00:16:37.715 --> 00:16:45.420]  Uh, but this is something where the have-nots, and there's increasingly more have-nots than there are the elite have.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.621]  And I think, uh, I think they're worried.
[00:16:47.641 --> 00:16:48.862]  They have good reason to be worried.
[00:16:49.082 --> 00:16:54.145]  Uh, and, uh, what now they did, again, the Gulf Coast being decimated, as it was.
[00:16:54.666 --> 00:16:56.267]  They were just coming back from Katrina.
[00:16:56.287 --> 00:16:58.608]  They wouldn't, you know, never get back to where they were.
[00:16:58.948 --> 00:17:01.190]  And now this happens, and we find out that, uh,
[00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:12.595]  The White House, the Coast Guard, Janet Napolitano, head of Homeland Security that controls the Coast Guard, are engaged in this massive cover-up and providing cover for BP.
[00:17:12.635 --> 00:17:14.136]  And I have a story out today.
[00:17:15.036 --> 00:17:20.059]  BP expanded its refinery down here on Lake Michigan in Hammond, Indiana.
[00:17:20.379 --> 00:17:22.380]  Stay there, stay there, we've got a break.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:27.784]  Come back and tell us on the other side and a lot more with Wayne Madsen.
[00:17:48.476 --> 00:17:49.717]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:55.121]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:17:55.362 --> 00:17:59.985]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:18:00.386 --> 00:18:05.450]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:10.634]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:19:52.443 --> 00:19:53.123]  Sinus pressure.

[00:20:41.567 --> 00:20:42.107]  Breathe free.
[00:20:58.487 --> 00:21:01.109]  Okay, Wayne, you got cut off by that break.
[00:21:01.169 --> 00:21:03.911]  Wayne Madsen on waynemadsenreport.com, investigative journalist.
[00:21:04.251 --> 00:21:08.635]  You were getting down to the bottom line with what's happening with BP.
[00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:15.373]  They've got this plant that they've expanded on Lake Michigan that's processing heavy Canadian crude.
[00:21:16.113 --> 00:21:23.897]  They have reneged on all the promises they made to the court when the environmental groups up here sued BP.
[00:21:24.377 --> 00:21:31.601]  The courts, of course, like many, were found in their favor, but said they promised they would take mitigating measures.
[00:21:32.421 --> 00:21:38.826]  They would do this mitigation to prevent their increased pollution from having an effect on Lake Michigan.
[00:21:38.846 --> 00:21:43.549]  But what I'm told here is that this Hammond Refinery is an accident waiting to happen.
[00:21:43.569 --> 00:21:53.456]  They have a record of safety violations, environmental violations, and that what's going on in the Gulf of Mexico today could easily happen to Lake Michigan.
[00:21:53.476 --> 00:21:58.340]  It'll affect not only the city of Chicago, but all the other
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.520]  I don't know.
[00:22:20.445 --> 00:22:20.826]  We're good to go.
[00:22:35.703 --> 00:22:37.184]  Well, that was my next point.
[00:22:37.204 --> 00:22:38.625]  Have you seen the CBS news piece?
[00:22:38.645 --> 00:22:39.866]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:23:02.119 --> 00:23:02.800]  I have.
[00:23:04.201 --> 00:23:06.864]  What I reported is the Coast Guard is part of the problem.
[00:23:06.884 --> 00:23:09.807]  It's part of the Homeland Security Department under Napolitano.
[00:23:10.208 --> 00:23:18.096]  The Coast Guard is basically covering for BP on orders of Napolitano.
[00:23:19.037 --> 00:23:22.980]  Really irritating people that I'm hearing from with the Army Corps of Engineers.
[00:23:23.461 --> 00:23:26.543]  And believe it or not, FEMA comes out smelling like a rose here.
[00:23:26.863 --> 00:23:37.912]  FEMA's really upset that what they're seeing with NOAA and the Coast Guard and the EPA covering up for what they've seen as a huge disaster.
[00:23:38.293 --> 00:23:39.614]  Well, for those who just joined us,
[00:23:40.274 --> 00:23:51.125]  All over the Gulf Coast, if anybody tries to go up, including CBS News, with video cameras on public beaches to show the oil, armed men come up and say, get out of here.
[00:23:51.546 --> 00:23:52.727]  I mean, this is not America.
[00:23:52.747 --> 00:23:58.413]  And going back three years ago, a few years after Katrina, Greg Palast of the BBC was working for ABC on the story.
[00:23:58.753 --> 00:24:02.177]  He went and showed one of these FEMA facilities that was holding people.
[00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:19.025]  You know, in these trailers of these emergency communities, and Pallas tried to videotape that was right next to a chemical dump, and they put out an arrest warrant for him that got retracted for terrorism, for violating national infrastructure security.
[00:24:19.085 --> 00:24:25.548]  So, if we're wondering where the government's going under the Patriot Act, they are using it to cover up real environmental problems.
[00:24:26.107 --> 00:24:36.595]  Hey, you know in that CBS video, that footage, the two Coast Guard guys tell CBS, the CBS crew, we're following BP rules here.
[00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:37.536]  We're under BP.
[00:24:37.836 --> 00:24:40.958]  Well, since when did the Coast Guard take orders from BP?
[00:24:41.879 --> 00:24:49.165]  I thought it was the other way around, so I think this is further proof of what's happening with corporate fascism in this country.
[00:24:50.498 --> 00:24:51.198]  It's incredible.
[00:24:51.278 --> 00:24:59.403]  I mean, all over the nation, you'll try to videotape, you know, a police car from a hundred yards away, and they'll come over and say, turn your camera off and arrest you.
[00:24:59.803 --> 00:25:02.785]  Or you try to show what BP's doing, you know, they threaten to arrest you.
[00:25:03.205 --> 00:25:05.686]  I mean, it's just no First Amendment.
[00:25:05.706 --> 00:25:06.567]  And then you got Kagan.
[00:25:07.287 --> 00:25:09.968]  Who openly says she doesn't believe in the First Amendment.
[00:25:09.988 --> 00:25:10.948]  They're like, oh great!
[00:25:11.408 --> 00:25:12.809]  Another Goldman Sachs crook.
[00:25:12.869 --> 00:25:14.809]  This is who we need as the new Supreme Court Justice.
[00:25:14.829 --> 00:25:16.830]  I mean, this is tyranny on every front.
[00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:22.432]  I want to hit a few other issues with Wayne Madsen on other big stories he's working on in the next five minutes.
[00:25:22.512 --> 00:25:26.313]  We have another guest joining us who's fighting the New World Order toe-to-toe.
[00:25:29.834 --> 00:25:31.215]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:25:31.255 --> 00:25:34.276]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:41.306]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:25:42.087 --> 00:25:43.028]  Tyranny is here.
[00:25:43.368 --> 00:25:46.891]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:25:46.911 --> 00:25:49.513]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:25:49.533 --> 00:25:54.978]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:25:55.398 --> 00:26:01.623]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:26:02.063 --> 00:26:07.604]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:26:08.044 --> 00:26:11.685]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:26:12.205 --> 00:26:16.206]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:26:16.486 --> 00:26:22.027]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:25.467]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:26:25.987 --> 00:26:27.408]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:26:27.968 --> 00:26:28.408]  It's here.

[00:26:40.971 --> 00:26:42.911]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:46.272]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:26:52.733 --> 00:26:53.394]  Big Brother.
[00:26:54.034 --> 00:26:54.994]  Mainstream media.
[00:26:55.792 --> 00:26:56.873]  Government cover-ups.
[00:26:57.554 --> 00:26:58.374]  You want answers?
[00:26:59.135 --> 00:27:00.055]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:00.696 --> 00:27:04.379]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:04.879 --> 00:27:08.982]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:10.543 --> 00:27:13.105]  Well, they're marching on the Capitol in Thailand.
[00:27:13.125 --> 00:27:14.947]  They're marching on the Capitol in Greece.
[00:27:18.575 --> 00:27:20.757]  Worldwide, the people are getting more and more angry.
[00:27:20.817 --> 00:27:26.100]  Incumbents are being thrown out in the primaries all across the United States, Democrats and Republicans.
[00:27:26.601 --> 00:27:27.782]  The people are waking up.
[00:27:28.102 --> 00:27:33.226]  Wayne Madsen, if you're going to be spending a lot of time in Chicago, I was asking you during the last break that, you know,
[00:27:33.806 --> 00:27:35.547]  Could this be what unravels Obama?
[00:27:35.567 --> 00:27:37.589]  And you said, absolutely, that's why I'm here.
[00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:42.873]  And you were saying the conventional wisdom on the street is, he's not going to be running for re-election.
[00:27:42.893 --> 00:27:47.898]  And we've even had Howard Dean coming out saying he may run, and that they may run other Democrats against him.
[00:27:47.938 --> 00:27:50.500]  So the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.902]  They built this guy up like it was the second coming of Christ.
[00:27:54.683 --> 00:27:57.005]  But boy, I tell you, he is crashing and burning.
[00:27:59.287 --> 00:28:00.468]  What's your take on that, Wayne?
[00:28:01.027 --> 00:28:06.389]  Well, Obama walks in in the last campaign without any kind of checks.
[00:28:06.449 --> 00:28:13.292]  He was a rock star and he glided in and he didn't really take much in the way of any barbs.
[00:28:13.332 --> 00:28:14.813]  But this next time he will.
[00:28:14.913 --> 00:28:16.153]  And Michelle knows that.
[00:28:16.973 --> 00:28:21.435]  They didn't have much money when he was in the Illinois State Senate.
[00:28:21.575 --> 00:28:22.976]  He's made all kinds of money now.
[00:28:23.316 --> 00:28:30.659]  And apparently her thinking is if they would leave, cut and run now, they could make more money as an ex-president.
[00:28:31.299 --> 00:28:34.480]  Then Bill Clinton even made and that's what they may be looking for.
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:39.642]  Obama's got a huge ego and he really does not take criticism very well.
[00:28:40.062 --> 00:28:47.965]  He may elect, and we might hear, well, you know, for my family, my children, you know, another campaign is going to be too tough.
[00:28:48.165 --> 00:28:49.425]  They'll come up with something.
[00:28:49.625 --> 00:28:57.308]  Now from your sources, is he bisexual or is the, what do they call that in Hollywood, is his wife and kids a beard?
[00:28:58.856 --> 00:29:04.022]  Uh, well it would be, the wife would be a beard, absolutely would be a beard.
[00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:15.373]  Look, there's a big scandal here with the Republican candidate for Senate, Kirk, now being outed as part of this gay ring along with Dennis Hastert and Mark Foley.
[00:29:15.453 --> 00:29:18.676]  So, you know, it's in both parties in this state.
[00:29:19.497 --> 00:29:19.977]  Absolutely!
[00:29:20.017 --> 00:29:30.264]  I mean, I have nothing against gay people, but why is it in Rome or anywhere else, when in the decline, it becomes like a guild, and the only people they're outing are the straights?
[00:29:30.764 --> 00:29:35.507]  Yeah, the problem with Kirk is he's apparently a Naval Reserve officer, Navy Intelligence.
[00:29:35.907 --> 00:29:40.590]  So here we go with not only the Don't Ask, Don't Tell issue, but also highly blackmailable.
[00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:44.993]  Now he wants to be the United States Senator, filling Obama's old seat from Illinois.
[00:29:48.047 --> 00:29:52.989]  So you predict curtains for Obama unless they launch an Iran war?
[00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:59.311]  Or what's your intel on how the establishment's going to try to finesse and finagle their way out of this?
[00:29:59.852 --> 00:30:13.477]  I think they could launch an Iran war and also say to Obama, you know, go ahead, go make a lot more money than Bill Clinton and we'll have another person we'll invest in, you know, bring in as the presidential candidate.
[00:30:13.956 --> 00:30:16.220]  And again, folks, Wayne Madsen doesn't just say things.
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.982]  He's one of our best sources of info.
[00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:21.708]  And this is just incredible coming from you, I guess, because you're there doing the research.
[00:30:24.052 --> 00:30:28.679]  Because if he is completely homosexual, my God, he is so blackmailed, isn't he?
[00:30:29.369 --> 00:30:30.030]  Right, he is.
[00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:37.816]  And remember, I supported Obama, but I put myself in the category of people that didn't do their job properly and investigate him.
[00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:49.346]  But the secrets were all here in Chicago, and there was just so many stories and so few people willing to dig deep on them.
[00:30:49.727 --> 00:30:53.250]  Because, as I mentioned, the Chicago newspapers have basically been destroyed.
[00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.813]  Well, you know, Bush was so bad, you would think
[00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:04.677]  Anything could be better and then it just gets worse and I think it's the establishment has committed so many crimes, why not commit a million more?
[00:31:05.377 --> 00:31:07.680]  Do you agree with me that all their chips are in though?
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.922]  I mean the establishment is going for broke.
[00:31:10.908 --> 00:31:17.789]  Well, I think that, you know, it's like a wild animal, when cornered or treed, they lash out.
[00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:21.750]  And I think that's exactly what these people are capable of doing.
[00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:26.991]  We don't know, you know, they still have a lot of influence, they still have a lot of power.
[00:31:27.292 --> 00:31:38.594]  What they're capable of, and certainly starting a war would be something, they've opted for that in the past, they would opt for it again in the future, but I think maybe the people around the world are a little wise to their
[00:31:39.034 --> 00:31:39.634]  Absolutely.
[00:31:39.674 --> 00:31:41.075]  WayneMadsonReport.com.
[00:31:41.135 --> 00:31:42.076]  Wayne, thanks for coming on.
[00:31:42.116 --> 00:31:42.656]  God bless you.
[00:31:43.396 --> 00:31:44.337]  Okay, thank you, Alex.
[00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:51.160]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:56.542]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:56.903 --> 00:31:58.623]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:58.944 --> 00:32:03.766]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:03.946 --> 00:32:04.906]  How much do you want?
[00:32:05.127 --> 00:32:05.867]  When do you want it?
[00:32:06.227 --> 00:32:07.848]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:08.128 --> 00:32:08.948]  When will you need it?
[00:32:09.188 --> 00:32:11.269]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:12.489]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:12.729 --> 00:32:14.070]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:19.331]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:19.532 --> 00:32:22.713]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:23.113 --> 00:32:26.574]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:26.934 --> 00:32:27.915]  How much will you need?
[00:32:28.156 --> 00:32:28.776]  We don't know.
[00:32:29.057 --> 00:32:29.958]  How much do you want?
[00:32:30.158 --> 00:32:30.899]  All you can get.
[00:32:31.099 --> 00:32:31.960]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.963]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:33:47.202 --> 00:33:49.525]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:33:49.605 --> 00:33:51.827]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:33:51.927 --> 00:33:54.731]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:33:55.131 --> 00:33:59.877]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:34:00.237 --> 00:34:04.442]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:07.066]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:34:07.086 --> 00:34:09.630]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:12.534]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:34:12.894 --> 00:34:20.486]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:34:20.822 --> 00:34:26.086]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:34:26.106 --> 00:34:28.488]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:34:28.528 --> 00:34:32.491]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:34:32.751 --> 00:34:33.651]  And I got news for you.
[00:34:33.832 --> 00:34:35.132]  You're everyone else.
[00:34:35.172 --> 00:34:36.153]  Invisible Empire.

[00:34:50.763 --> 00:34:56.227]  Ah, George Osborne, Bullingdon Club, William Hague, hello the elites, how are the Zionist elites this morning?
[00:34:56.247 --> 00:34:59.089]  Thank you for giving us the illusion of democracy.
[00:34:59.109 --> 00:35:02.150]  Do you want the puppet on the left or the puppet on the right?
[00:35:02.591 --> 00:35:06.953]  Yes, you guys go slightly crazy when you compromise personal morality for political gain.
[00:35:07.354 --> 00:35:09.415]  Hey, how was your time on the Rothschild's yacht?
[00:35:09.935 --> 00:35:12.257]  You like the Rothschilds more than you like normal people.
[00:35:12.657 --> 00:35:18.941]  George Osborne, isn't it great that you have a country of 70 million people where 7% control all the land?
[00:35:19.401 --> 00:35:20.802]  Are you related to the Queen, sir?
[00:35:21.363 --> 00:35:22.063]  Go home, Yang.
[00:35:23.284 --> 00:35:23.944]  Go home, Yang.
[00:35:24.065 --> 00:35:26.346]  Oh, some random racism by this gentleman here.
[00:35:26.366 --> 00:35:30.449]  Perhaps you'd like to vote for the BNP?
[00:35:30.469 --> 00:35:32.050]  William Hague, George Osborne.
[00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:32.390]  Hey!
[00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.832]  It must be difficult fellating Satan all day.
[00:35:35.852 --> 00:35:39.115]  Hey, power and money from the nice teat of Satan.
[00:35:40.175 --> 00:35:43.518]  Sorry, I'm not even religious, but you guys are liars and murderers!
[00:35:44.218 --> 00:35:46.079]  Total liars and murderers!
[00:35:46.139 --> 00:35:48.601]  You should talk about America!
[00:35:48.701 --> 00:35:53.124]  I'm not even American, my friend, I'm Scottish, so F you!
[00:35:54.705 --> 00:35:56.526]  Even worse, get out of the UK!
[00:35:58.588 --> 00:36:07.634]  Perhaps you'd prefer if we joined the European Union, you little shill idiot!
[00:36:07.654 --> 00:36:08.615]  Yeah, liars!
[00:36:08.635 --> 00:36:09.535]  Hello, liars!
[00:36:09.575 --> 00:36:10.976]  Hey, big power and money!
[00:36:11.037 --> 00:36:11.857]  Politics, yeah!
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.683]  Well, it was about a year ago that we had Charlie Veitch on with us.
[00:36:21.557 --> 00:36:26.700]  And back then he had started the Love Police, kind of like We Are Change or InfoWars groups.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.321]  It's like British Tea Party.
[00:36:29.562 --> 00:36:34.205]  And they just go out to public events and show the police state and confront globalists.
[00:36:35.065 --> 00:36:40.889]  There he was confronting the new British Prime Minister, David Cameron, and shutting down their press conference.
[00:36:43.345 --> 00:36:49.928]  And it's another example of the effect you can have by just confronting these people with the truth and the facts.
[00:36:50.389 --> 00:37:00.634]  They've been arrested for videotaping, they've been arrested for publicly speaking, they've been locked up by security guards, they've been harassed because England has become a police state.
[00:37:00.954 --> 00:37:08.558]  Two years ago they changed the law where you can't videotape in public or they arrest you as a terrorist, but the government's going to watch you and track what you're doing.
[00:37:09.298 --> 00:37:15.467]  And more and more the media, not just alternative media, is standing up and saying, no, we must resist these tyrants.
[00:37:15.888 --> 00:37:21.035]  Charlie, it's good to have you on with us from the UK today.
[00:37:22.091 --> 00:37:23.572]  Hello Alex, how are things over in the States?
[00:37:23.992 --> 00:37:24.432]  Good, good.
[00:37:24.472 --> 00:37:25.312]  It's good to have you here.
[00:37:26.092 --> 00:37:32.274]  So much is going on in the world today and we see incumbents being thrown out here in the U.S.
[00:37:32.314 --> 00:37:35.075]  We see rioting starting all over the world.
[00:37:35.795 --> 00:37:38.976]  We see the world financial market basically imploding.
[00:37:40.557 --> 00:37:50.220]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and going from just somebody trying to shoot video in London being harassed to now starting to love police that's starting to catch on.
[00:37:51.209 --> 00:37:52.270]  Yeah, absolutely Alex.
[00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:57.333]  As you said once in one of your speeches, I have an infinite human spirit which refuses to submit.
[00:37:57.353 --> 00:38:03.577]  I'm just one human being and I hate what's happening to my country which masquerades as a free country.
[00:38:03.657 --> 00:38:07.860]  So as you say, I'm just one guy with a camera, with a megaphone that goes out there to try and expose it.
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:15.784]  And what we like to say, we like to point the camera up the rear end of evil and just show people that there's nothing to be scared of.
[00:38:15.824 --> 00:38:21.968]  These are pathetic and lonely and sad individuals who have no love in their hearts, who just want to control others.
[00:38:22.048 --> 00:38:23.208]  And not on my watch.
[00:38:23.268 --> 00:38:24.969]  It's just not going to happen as long as I'm around.
[00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:28.851]  So, when did you start the Love Police?
[00:38:28.871 --> 00:38:35.155]  Because you guys are really active and are gaining a lot of attention for good now on a weekly basis.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:40.184]  Yeah, I started The Love Police almost exactly 13 months ago.
[00:38:40.204 --> 00:38:44.008]  It kind of happened a few days after I came on your show.
[00:38:44.028 --> 00:38:49.594]  There's no connection there, but I just started filming outside the American Embassy, which you saw, and I lost my job.
[00:38:49.654 --> 00:38:54.039]  I was working for one of the main banks in Britain called the Halifax Bank of Scotland.
[00:38:54.259 --> 00:38:56.882]  Bank of Scotland's a 500-year-old institution.
[00:38:57.523 --> 00:39:00.269]  I lost my job in the recession so I was on the inside.
[00:39:00.369 --> 00:39:07.405]  I saw myself selling investments and investing in companies which are war companies, the big business parties, big
[00:39:08.129 --> 00:39:08.949]  We're good to go.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.202]  I can't see myself doing anything else.
[00:39:33.502 --> 00:39:38.707]  You call your channel InfoWars and I believe we are in a war for people's consciousness.
[00:39:38.747 --> 00:39:48.476]  It is a war for equality and what the elites are trying to do, the international financiers, is to dehumanize everyone to the point where we don't even think that we should be allowed to live.
[00:39:48.516 --> 00:39:51.799]  And I have friends, my own friends, close people to me who
[00:39:52.339 --> 00:39:56.462]  Who think we should wipe each other out, who think that we need a virus to wipe us out.
[00:39:56.482 --> 00:39:58.004]  And this is what I'm trying to fight against.
[00:39:58.044 --> 00:40:01.466]  Like, the point of the Love Police is to lower fear and raise love.
[00:40:01.707 --> 00:40:08.993]  And the best way to do that is to shine a light on these puppets and show the people, the great masses, that we have nothing to be scared of them.
[00:40:09.393 --> 00:40:12.255]  And great evil things bring out the best in people.
[00:40:12.315 --> 00:40:12.916]  And that's all I do.
[00:40:13.922 --> 00:40:30.788]  Well normally you are loving when you're just out in the middle of the street or on the sidewalk in London and police come over and say you can't film, you can't talk to fellow people in England and really illustrating just how out of control the police state is.
[00:40:31.308 --> 00:40:33.529]  And I remember five years ago in England they started putting
[00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:37.311]  Tracker RFID chips in the trash bins.
[00:40:37.691 --> 00:40:40.953]  Now that's coming to Virginia and Texas and California.
[00:40:41.393 --> 00:40:49.718]  I remember five, six years ago, remote control thermostats in people's homes in England, where the government tracks everything you do and controls your thermostat.
[00:40:50.058 --> 00:40:53.400]  Now that's coming here to the United States.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:58.143]  The police taking DNA at checkpoints started six, seven, eight years ago in England.
[00:40:58.443 --> 00:40:59.944]  Now that's coming here.
[00:41:00.544 --> 00:41:05.745]  So, England is always five, six, seven years, depending on what issue, ahead of us.
[00:41:06.526 --> 00:41:13.208]  England in the last five years has started making people take satellite tracker boxes in their cars to tax them by the mile in many cities.
[00:41:13.508 --> 00:41:20.610]  Or using the license plates to turn regular roads into toll roads with license plate identification systems.
[00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:23.350]  The secret arrest of citizens.
[00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:24.611]  Government terror.
[00:41:25.891 --> 00:41:30.073]  The center of one of the most wicked empires on earth being the British Empire.
[00:41:30.133 --> 00:41:35.776]  That model, according to Carol Quigley at Georgetown, Bill Clinton's mentor, is the British Empire model.
[00:41:36.056 --> 00:41:40.618]  Not so much the British Empire itself, though it is now bigger in the banking system than even New York.
[00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:46.120]  But the system, you know, it's not the Irish or the Scottish or the English that are bad.
[00:41:47.161 --> 00:41:48.701]  It's not the American people that are bad.
[00:41:48.741 --> 00:41:52.443]  It's not the Mexican government, the Mexican people that are bad.
[00:41:52.503 --> 00:41:53.923]  It's the Mexican government that's bad.
[00:41:54.223 --> 00:41:55.564]  It's not the Chinese people that are bad.
[00:41:55.624 --> 00:41:57.565]  It's the Chinese government that's bad.
[00:41:58.185 --> 00:42:06.168]  Because in history, governments tend to be ruthless and controlling, and there's no doubt they're working together to bring in this world tyranny against we the people.
[00:42:06.209 --> 00:42:09.330]  So break down the transformation in your lifetime
[00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:18.718]  of what the UK has turned into as a warning to the rest of the world because you were definitely sitting in the Orwellian Airstrip 1, the model for the rest of the globe.
[00:42:19.505 --> 00:42:24.749]  Yeah, we are the airstrip for America and the British Cabal to launch their operations around the world.
[00:42:24.769 --> 00:42:34.476]  What I've seen in my lifetime is, just in the last 5-10 years, the incredible CCTV control, the cameras all over London.
[00:42:34.656 --> 00:42:38.459]  You can't walk around London without getting filmed by at least 300 cameras.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:43.423]  And one thing we always try and say to the Love Police, if they can film us, surely we can film them.
[00:42:43.883 --> 00:42:46.005]  If they're going to be tracking us, we can track them.
[00:42:46.045 --> 00:42:47.086]  We can bother them.
[00:42:47.146 --> 00:42:48.166]  It works both ways.
[00:42:48.267 --> 00:42:53.350]  And, you know, we are strong human beings and we will not accept this total control.
[00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:54.631]  And it is a nanny state.
[00:42:54.731 --> 00:42:56.453]  It's people trying to tell us what to do.
[00:42:56.873 --> 00:42:59.895]  And I personally, Alex, I am a philosophical anarchist.
[00:43:00.576 --> 00:43:07.021]  I think government is totally the problem and the world is awakening now to a point where we will not need these antiquated
[00:43:07.321 --> 00:43:07.841]  We're good to go.
[00:43:36.485 --> 00:43:36.925]  Yes, we are.
[00:43:56.897 --> 00:44:07.406]  Well, I've got three articles today with census workers raping people, attacking people with attack dogs they bring to the door now as part of their petty power trip.
[00:44:07.786 --> 00:44:10.128]  Census workers who are convicted pedophiles.
[00:44:10.488 --> 00:44:13.511]  The government knew the guy was a pedophile and hired him.
[00:44:13.571 --> 00:44:21.798]  More and more of the TSA workers are robbing people, raping women, going crazy and announcing, I'm God, I'm God.
[00:44:21.838 --> 00:44:23.859]  Now several of them have just had complete
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.943]  Delusions of grandeur, believing they're God.
[00:44:26.963 --> 00:44:39.517]  They're also taking all these dumbed down fluoride heads, who've been watching television their whole life, who literally have shriveled brains, and giving them power.
[00:44:40.057 --> 00:44:41.998]  And that's what's even more sickening about tyranny.
[00:44:42.018 --> 00:44:50.063]  It's not just the far-off elitist robbing you, but you've got to put up with lesser men and women who can't get a real job, who are petty.
[00:44:50.083 --> 00:44:56.786]  You know, a real man is ashamed to exercise undue power on people and to make people grovel.
[00:44:57.126 --> 00:45:05.811]  But petty scum can find a million positions in this archipelago of control freak behavior.
[00:45:06.191 --> 00:45:08.513]  And so tyranny is a wonderland
[00:45:09.293 --> 00:45:24.754]  uh... of of corruption and then the government with taxpayer money is to decide what films get made and and what the people see i mean it's a bunch of scum playing god and i am just not gonna let a bunch of pedophiles with machine guns run my life
[00:45:25.976 --> 00:45:29.239]  Alex, you're absolutely right about the pedophile thing at the top.
[00:45:29.459 --> 00:45:33.142]  It's exploding now in Scotland with a case of a girl with Down Syndrome.
[00:45:33.183 --> 00:45:42.531]  The Scottish elite, the legal and police and government elite, there was a pedophile cabal abusing a disabled young girl called Holly Gregg.
[00:45:42.711 --> 00:45:48.457]  Well, how many, and we've covered that, but how many Homeland Security state heads have been caught being pedophiles?
[00:45:48.517 --> 00:45:56.005]  I mean, we have to understand, how do you get people that'll steal bank accounts, rob, torture, lie, listen to people illegally?
[00:45:56.025 --> 00:45:58.227]  Well, because they're criminals.
[00:45:58.287 --> 00:46:02.732]  Some are money launderers, some drug dealers, but most of them are perverts.
[00:46:03.032 --> 00:46:07.998]  And that's what we face, is a legion of pot-bellied perverts with automatic weapons.
[00:46:08.559 --> 00:46:12.724]  But the good news is the police and the military are starting to wake up here.
[00:46:13.084 --> 00:46:14.886]  Are you seeing some of the police wake up in your area?
[00:46:15.678 --> 00:46:16.558]  Massively, Alex.
[00:46:16.618 --> 00:46:25.142]  The times I get arrested, there's always a few policemen in the station that come to my cell, shake my hand, tell me I'm doing great work, that they are also concerned.
[00:46:25.502 --> 00:46:38.708]  There are good people in the military, there's good people in the police, and the job of the love police is to communicate with as many police as possible in London, give them hugs, remind them of their humanity, and also remind them what kind of world that they're going to be bringing in for their children and grandchildren.
[00:46:39.208 --> 00:46:44.072]  So it's not just a resistance thing, it's also a reminder to people of just how glorious and special they are.
[00:46:44.252 --> 00:46:47.794]  And that we're all humans, we're all humans, and we shouldn't serve the potbellies.
[00:46:48.355 --> 00:46:52.598]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:46:52.918 --> 00:46:56.981]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:46:57.241 --> 00:47:02.105]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[00:47:04.582 --> 00:47:04.962]  We're good to go!
[00:47:29.099 --> 00:47:33.865]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:47:34.145 --> 00:47:38.170]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:39.872]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:47:40.112 --> 00:47:44.717]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:47:49.122 --> 00:47:49.963]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:47:50.143 --> 00:47:55.489]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:47:55.669 --> 00:47:56.089]  I get it.
[00:47:56.229 --> 00:48:05.579]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:48:05.839 --> 00:48:07.020]  That's not what's happening.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:15.484]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:48:15.725 --> 00:48:18.986]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:48:19.106 --> 00:48:23.169]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:48:23.369 --> 00:48:24.950]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:28.212]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:48:28.932 --> 00:48:32.474]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:48:32.734 --> 00:48:33.455]  You should too.
[00:48:33.635 --> 00:48:34.616]  Find out what they know.
[00:48:34.797 --> 00:48:38.081]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:48:38.101 --> 00:48:38.141]  800-686-2237.
[00:48:38.161 --> 00:48:38.461]  800-686-2237.
[00:48:38.481 --> 00:48:38.681]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:48:49.233 --> 00:48:52.114]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:48:52.894 --> 00:48:53.835]  Tyranny is here.
[00:48:54.155 --> 00:48:57.816]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:48:57.836 --> 00:49:00.297]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:49:00.317 --> 00:49:05.759]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:12.402]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:49:12.842 --> 00:49:18.403]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:49:18.783 --> 00:49:22.504]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:49:23.004 --> 00:49:27.045]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:49:27.285 --> 00:49:32.806]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:49:33.226 --> 00:49:36.307]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:49:36.787 --> 00:49:38.167]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:49:38.747 --> 00:49:39.208]  It's here.

[00:49:51.362 --> 00:49:53.204]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:49:53.665 --> 00:49:54.065]  Don't!
[00:49:54.525 --> 00:49:57.548]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[00:50:21.629 --> 00:50:22.590]  Herb K was right.

[00:50:26.033 --> 00:50:27.073]  What have you got to lose?
[00:50:27.454 --> 00:50:28.454]  Stop the calls now.

[00:50:39.063 --> 00:50:39.103]  800-822-1291.
[00:50:39.123 --> 00:50:43.367]  If you want to go to the Love Police website, it's C, the letter C, vh.org.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.021]  We appreciate him joining us.
[00:51:01.041 --> 00:51:07.685]  We're going to be taking your calls coming up some in the next segment about political activism, what's happening in the world, any news items you want to mention.
[00:51:07.705 --> 00:51:09.767]  I'm going to hit some other news stories as well.
[00:51:09.787 --> 00:51:24.557]  We've got some really important news coming up on the financial front in the next hour with a political researcher and a financial author dealing with state banks, taking the power of currency and giving it back to the people, the power of credit.
[00:51:25.077 --> 00:51:27.800]  And dealing with some of the state banks around the country.
[00:51:28.121 --> 00:51:29.823]  This is a short segment though.
[00:51:29.863 --> 00:51:32.426]  Charlie, we've got a bunch of these videos.
[00:51:32.466 --> 00:51:34.428]  We can play them here, but they're all up on your website.
[00:51:34.708 --> 00:51:38.032]  The reason I've got you here is that you guys are very effective.
[00:51:38.392 --> 00:51:42.217]  Your videos are getting hundreds of thousands of views together.
[00:51:42.697 --> 00:51:48.866]  And it's another example of not just We Are Change or the Tea Parties or InfoWar groups or 9-11 Truth groups.
[00:51:49.226 --> 00:51:53.612]  It's just anybody can be a leader who's willing to stand up and go out and now you've had others join you.
[00:51:53.932 --> 00:51:56.736]  Now you're not out there alone and it's gaining steam.
[00:51:56.796 --> 00:51:59.180]  Another example of how resistance is victory.
[00:52:00.174 --> 00:52:00.915]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:52:00.955 --> 00:52:08.560]  I think one thing that's important for people to know, you know the film The Matrix, how there's Neo, the character played by Keanu Reeves, that's an anagram of the One.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:16.105]  And when everyone realizes that they are the One, they have that connection to the Source themselves, to whichever religion or spirituality you believe in.
[00:52:16.505 --> 00:52:22.168]  You are an infinite power and you have nothing to be scared of from these pathetic, controlling tyrants.
[00:52:22.668 --> 00:52:26.170]  And one thing that we like to do at The Love Police is to put these videos out there.
[00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:34.494]  We never force people to watch them, but it just shows people that you can do this and survive and be happy and have a great life just by being a decent human being.
[00:52:34.534 --> 00:52:43.139]  And to me, being a decent human being is standing up against anyone who attempts to destroy and poison my fellow human beings, and including me.
[00:52:44.059 --> 00:52:48.481]  For many years I was living under the mass hypnosis illusion that things were okay.
[00:52:48.501 --> 00:52:50.282]  I was a big believer in the mainstream media.
[00:52:50.642 --> 00:52:58.085]  I even joined the armed forces after September the 11th for the British Army because I wanted to go out there and kill terrorists because I believed it.
[00:52:58.365 --> 00:53:11.190]  And you don't know how upset and angry I am and I'm not sure yet I'll be able to forgive those people who lied to me and who lied to all those other young men and women who joined the armed forces thinking they're fighting for freedom when in fact they're fighting for Halliburton.
[00:53:12.799 --> 00:53:15.320]  What woke you up?
[00:53:16.661 --> 00:53:20.863]  I think it was a combination of luck in that I lost my job.
[00:53:20.923 --> 00:53:22.223]  I didn't quit.
[00:53:22.343 --> 00:53:24.484]  I just lost my job because the economy went bad.
[00:53:24.864 --> 00:53:27.165]  And I've always been a bit of a rebel since a young age.
[00:53:27.686 --> 00:53:30.567]  I never really listened to authority.
[00:53:30.587 --> 00:53:31.947]  I was very anti-authoritarian.
[00:53:31.967 --> 00:53:36.689]  But I think it was just maybe what people like David Icke talk about.
[00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:42.212]  There is a general vibrational change happening in the world, as Brzezinski says, a general awakening.
[00:53:42.712 --> 00:53:48.134]  And I'm just lucky that it came to me before I got sent out to Iraq to go and shoot innocent people.
[00:53:49.154 --> 00:53:49.874]  Absolutely.
[00:53:49.954 --> 00:53:51.495]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:53:51.555 --> 00:53:57.917]  Did you see that video two weeks ago, three weeks ago, out of Pennsylvania, where it says, we're watching you, Tom.
[00:53:58.317 --> 00:54:00.238]  Nice house, nice car, Tom.
[00:54:00.598 --> 00:54:02.058]  You owe the state $3,000.
[00:54:02.518 --> 00:54:03.319]  We know where you are.
[00:54:03.339 --> 00:54:04.319]  We're coming to get you.
[00:54:04.779 --> 00:54:10.701]  And I'm seeing articles every day of people losing their houses for parking tickets or for water bills.
[00:54:11.361 --> 00:54:23.405]  And everybody I know who is not doing well financially all over the country is getting calls now where collection agencies for the government are threatening you with jail if you don't pay them.
[00:54:24.926 --> 00:54:32.248]  The taxes are all going up but the infrastructure is falling apart because almost all the money is going to the bankers like it's Nigeria or Argentina.
[00:54:32.708 --> 00:54:34.249]  And here's one out of the Huffington Post.
[00:54:35.009 --> 00:54:38.412]  Woman's home confiscated over small water bill.
[00:54:39.093 --> 00:54:43.477]  They now take your house over a $362 bill.
[00:54:43.837 --> 00:54:46.480]  I mean, if this isn't tyranny, I don't know what it is.
[00:54:47.788 --> 00:54:49.009]  It is total tyranny.
[00:54:49.189 --> 00:54:51.491]  But one thing I can say, I'm always an optimist, Alex.
[00:54:51.551 --> 00:54:53.272]  I like to always look on the bright side.
[00:54:53.412 --> 00:54:58.776]  But these mistakes they made, this tyranny they imposed, it wakes up people at a much more accelerated pace.
[00:54:59.237 --> 00:55:01.999]  And what I think, it's the bankers that cause this financial crisis.
[00:55:02.019 --> 00:55:14.288]  And if it's the bankers trying to take your house, what people need to do en masse is start barricading themselves, you know, getting themselves able to mount a defensive front against anyone who attempts to come to their house and pick them out.
[00:55:14.788 --> 00:55:17.752]  And I also think people need to stand together.
[00:55:17.792 --> 00:55:29.407]  There was actually a writer from Soviet Russia called Solzhenitsyn, and he said that when they were coming round for the mass roundups of political dissidents, what he says is that they didn't value freedom enough.
[00:55:29.528 --> 00:55:32.652]  People should have set up ambushes in staircases using
[00:55:33.072 --> 00:55:35.553]  Baseball bats, or hammers, or pots and pans.
[00:55:35.593 --> 00:55:46.079]  And he said that if people did a massive rise up, the state does not have enough thugs to round up hundreds of thousands of people if a few hundred of them are starting to fight back.
[00:55:46.339 --> 00:55:49.801]  Yeah guys, print me the Alexander Shultz-Enitsen quote.
[00:55:49.841 --> 00:55:59.445]  It starts with Alexander Shultz-Enitsen, oh how we burned in the camps later, wishing that when the NKVD that arrested, in the case he was talking about in
[00:56:00.686 --> 00:56:06.490]  In Leningrad, more than half the population and took many of them to their deaths.
[00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:10.692]  But according to the government today, that's a good thing to be taken away to your death.
[00:56:10.732 --> 00:56:21.759]  And here in the U.S., they're openly proposing arresting people, the Pentagon, with no charges, no nothing, secretly stripping you of your citizenship and disappearing you into a black hole.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:31.162]  While Salon calls me up saying, oh Alex, you're making up the FEMA camps, as they openly admit they're building the camps.
[00:56:31.582 --> 00:56:35.183]  Long segment coming up will cover Shultz and Eatson's quote and a lot more.
[00:56:35.203 --> 00:56:36.404]  We're talking to the Love Police.
[00:56:38.524 --> 00:56:39.444]  We're on the march.
[00:56:39.924 --> 00:56:41.525]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:56:42.465 --> 00:56:45.146]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:47.892 --> 00:56:49.494]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:56:49.534 --> 00:56:52.356]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[00:56:58.142 --> 00:57:01.305]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.

[00:57:09.213 --> 00:57:11.535]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:57:11.856 --> 00:57:18.082]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:57:18.382 --> 00:57:19.784]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:57:41.527 --> 00:57:42.468]  Thank you!
[00:57:47.523 --> 00:57:52.387]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:57:52.487 --> 00:57:53.267]  What have we got?
[00:57:53.487 --> 00:57:55.609]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:57:55.929 --> 00:57:56.670]  A republic.
[00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:59.512]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:57:59.592 --> 00:58:01.513]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:58:01.854 --> 00:58:03.755]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:58:03.875 --> 00:58:05.156]  So they think they own our land?
[00:58:05.556 --> 00:58:06.697]  They think they own our water?
[00:58:06.877 --> 00:58:07.278]  Children?
[00:58:07.498 --> 00:58:08.278]  Our education?
[00:58:08.619 --> 00:58:09.219]  Our money?
[00:58:09.439 --> 00:58:13.102]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:58:13.442 --> 00:58:18.088]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:58:18.428 --> 00:58:19.249]  We have the facts.
[00:58:19.449 --> 00:58:20.570]  We have the Constitution.
[00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:21.492]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:58:21.512 --> 00:58:22.353]  We have common law.
[00:58:22.413 --> 00:58:24.655]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:24.936 --> 00:58:28.700]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:33.585]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:58:33.765 --> 00:58:35.147]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:58:35.267 --> 00:58:36.088]  Don't tread on me.

[00:58:47.401 --> 00:58:48.661]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:48.701 --> 00:58:54.063]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:54.303 --> 00:58:58.925]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:58:59.305 --> 00:58:59.705]  It's true.
[00:58:59.785 --> 00:59:04.347]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:59:04.887 --> 00:59:09.568]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:10.108 --> 00:59:12.029]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:59:12.429 --> 00:59:17.030]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:18.110]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:21.091]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:59:21.411 --> 00:59:24.692]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:25.012 --> 00:59:27.853]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:28.213 --> 00:59:30.094]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:30.434 --> 00:59:31.195]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:31.215 --> 00:59:31.475]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:31.515 --> 00:59:34.496]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:35.016 --> 00:59:36.737]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:57.691 --> 00:59:58.872]  Well, it's outrageous.
[00:59:58.992 --> 01:00:01.653]  Calderon has now given his speech to the Congress.
[01:00:01.753 --> 01:00:02.814]  I have the text of it.
[01:00:03.174 --> 01:00:06.216]  Paul Watson has an article up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:08.477]  He attacked the Second Amendment.
[01:00:09.707 --> 01:00:21.972]  Not only is a foreign dictator who wasn't elected, that's on record, who set up a total police state, a narco-terrorist state that's waging a war against other cartels that aren't laundering money through U.S.
[01:00:22.032 --> 01:00:22.372]  banks.
[01:00:22.893 --> 01:00:38.079]  Not only is he here telling 30 million illegal aliens to politically rise up in our country, a foreign leader with a group of people that see themselves as foreigners, he now wants our Second Amendment and is blaming violence in his repressed country where no citizen can own guns.
[01:00:39.964 --> 01:00:41.125]  On our Second Amendment.
[01:00:43.548 --> 01:00:49.595]  And we are defeating the establishment right now, peacefully, with political information.
[01:00:49.655 --> 01:00:56.242]  That's why Cass Sunstein and Kagan and all these globalists are saying, censor the internet, censor free speech, shut us down.
[01:00:57.263 --> 01:00:59.926]  Because they can't get away with this if our voices are being heard.
[01:01:00.466 --> 01:01:01.728]  And so they're now coming out
[01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:09.310]  Conditioning and acclimating and testing the water, sending up trial balloons, to openly shut down free speech.
[01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:12.631]  And every time the media calls me, they say, are you causing violence?
[01:01:12.651 --> 01:01:13.631]  Are you going to cause violence?
[01:01:15.032 --> 01:01:17.013]  Which we're speaking out against violence.
[01:01:17.493 --> 01:01:27.797]  But what does it lead to when they say, we're going to start arresting you and disappearing you into a gulag, or worse, and no one will even know we took you?
[01:01:28.197 --> 01:01:29.677]  I mean, that's in the legislation.
[01:01:29.718 --> 01:01:30.698]  That's being promoted.
[01:01:32.423 --> 01:01:40.054]  And then it leads us to the point of, when the secret police are coming to drag you away, then people are going to be forced to physically resist.
[01:01:40.534 --> 01:01:42.357]  That's why Oath Keepers is so important.
[01:01:42.377 --> 01:01:47.804]  That's why we're reaching out to military and police right now, like our lives depend on it, because they do.
[01:01:49.329 --> 01:01:49.869]  Listen to this.
[01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:51.729]  This is the Alexander Sholtson-Eachin.
[01:01:52.129 --> 01:01:53.530]  Won the Nobel Prize.
[01:01:53.590 --> 01:01:54.710]  Ronald Reagan praised him.
[01:01:54.730 --> 01:01:58.331]  For anybody demonizing him, again, this is somebody praised by our government.
[01:01:58.671 --> 01:02:00.451]  Of course, that was 25-30 years ago.
[01:02:00.971 --> 01:02:01.571]  Not anymore.
[01:02:01.771 --> 01:02:02.671]  He's demonized now.
[01:02:03.711 --> 01:02:15.674]  And how we burned in the camps later thinking, what would things have been like if every security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family?
[01:02:15.854 --> 01:02:17.594]  Or if, during periods of mass arrest,
[01:02:18.414 --> 01:02:24.879]  As for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, some estimates are almost half, but that was in one period.
[01:02:25.579 --> 01:02:43.312]  Or, if during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, pawling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door, at every step on the staircase, but had understood that they had nothing left to lose and had boldly
[01:02:43.932 --> 01:02:50.857]  set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of a half-dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else they had at hand.
[01:02:51.718 --> 01:03:06.590]  The organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt if, if we didn't love freedom enough and even more
[01:03:07.881 --> 01:03:10.421]  We had no awareness of the real situation.
[01:03:11.022 --> 01:03:16.403]  We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward, Alexander Schultz and Aitzen.
[01:03:17.623 --> 01:03:20.123]  So, here's the article.
[01:03:20.203 --> 01:03:22.464]  It's up at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:03:22.484 --> 01:03:25.024]  It's also at GCNLive.com.
[01:03:26.525 --> 01:03:27.665]  This is up at GCNLive.com.
[01:03:27.685 --> 01:03:29.385]  It's important to get this article out to everyone.
[01:03:30.425 --> 01:03:33.806]  Dictator of failed state lectures Americans about freedom.
[01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:39.326]  Dear Mr. Calderon, get the hell out of the U.S.
[01:03:39.466 --> 01:03:43.807]  That is the sub-headline I had Watson write by Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones.
[01:03:43.827 --> 01:03:45.048]  We wrote this together this morning.
[01:03:45.508 --> 01:03:54.610]  Americans were once again forced to endure the dictator of a failed state which represses and subjugates its citizens as a matter of course lecturing the U.S.
[01:03:54.670 --> 01:04:03.093]  about how his people were being discriminated against yesterday when unelected Mexican President Felipe Calderon bashed the Arizona
[01:04:03.453 --> 01:04:04.613]  Illegal immigration law.
[01:04:04.673 --> 01:04:11.615]  Calderon commented, such laws as an Arizona law is forcing our people to face discrimination during a White House meeting.
[01:04:11.936 --> 01:04:15.036]  Calderon later attacked the Second Amendment in a speech to the U.S.
[01:04:15.076 --> 01:04:15.537]  Congress.
[01:04:15.617 --> 01:04:17.197]  Get out of our internal affairs!
[01:04:17.977 --> 01:04:19.758]  What, using a political weapon against us?
[01:04:19.798 --> 01:04:20.678]  This is treason!
[01:04:20.918 --> 01:04:21.738]  This is sedition!
[01:04:21.778 --> 01:04:22.759]  This is an invasion!
[01:04:23.039 --> 01:04:26.580]  This is a foreign leader trying to invoke sedition in our country!
[01:04:27.677 --> 01:04:44.986]  Blaming Mexico's spiraling drug violence on guns being smuggled from inside America, though the studies show over 90% are being bought by the army and then sold, while failing to mention the fact that the lax border security, something we vehemently support, but only on American borders, is the primary cause of the problem.
[01:04:45.886 --> 01:04:52.276]  And he says Calderon's use of the term our people is a slap in the face of every American and every Hispanic American who has immigrated legally.
[01:04:52.776 --> 01:04:57.343]  Since when did the leader of a foreign nation address his own constituency from within
[01:04:58.792 --> 01:05:00.073]  An entirely different country.
[01:05:00.754 --> 01:05:05.978]  If the millions of illegal aliens living in America see themselves as Mexicans, then why do they insist on staying in the U.S.
[01:05:06.018 --> 01:05:06.438]  illegally?
[01:05:06.658 --> 01:05:08.100]  Well, because they say this is Mexico.
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:11.642]  But if the Mexican system is so good, why don't you stay in Mexico then?
[01:05:12.303 --> 01:05:20.269]  Now, expanding on that, we played a video clip earlier, and I don't know if Watson has this in the article, where Obama said, we've gone past our borders.
[01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:21.590]  We're one country.
[01:05:22.011 --> 01:05:23.232]  I mean, that is treason.
[01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:41.845]  Going back to Charlie Veitch of the Love Police, they're doing the same thing in England, bringing in masses of foreigners who are just human beings too, but then playing them off against the rest of the people in the country as a political weapon and as a tool of balkanization.
[01:05:41.885 --> 01:05:42.726]  What's your view on that?
[01:05:43.723 --> 01:06:09.235]  Absolutely Alex, I'm happy you brought that up because in many of my films many of the commenters notice how the most aggressive physically people are the non-native British and as you say they're human beings as well but these are people from Rwanda or from Sudan or from Serbia, Bosnia who've been through a war a war zone and now they've been given a police community support officer with police powers uniform and they are violent!
[01:06:09.295 --> 01:06:10.016]  I've never had a
[01:06:11.076 --> 01:06:14.658]  A native gentleman Englishman, a policeman, hit me.
[01:06:15.038 --> 01:06:20.000]  But I have had security thugs from Eastern Europe and from Africa, you know.
[01:06:20.641 --> 01:06:23.682]  God bless them, but they... Let me just interrupt again.
[01:06:23.702 --> 01:06:33.087]  I had a Member of Parliament on a few months ago and he admitted that over half of the CPS workers kidnapping kids are foreigners as well who can't even speak English.
[01:06:33.127 --> 01:06:34.447]  So, we know what this is.
[01:06:34.507 --> 01:06:39.470]  Bring in foreigners, give them uniforms, make them the military and the police, and they'll do whatever they're told.
[01:06:40.521 --> 01:06:41.281]  Absolutely Alex.
[01:06:41.342 --> 01:06:47.025]  And one thing I think is very important for me to say because a lot of my friends are saying, oh Alex Jones is a fear monger.
[01:06:47.085 --> 01:06:48.165]  Alex, you're not a fear monger.
[01:06:48.185 --> 01:06:49.906]  You give the information truthfully.
[01:06:49.926 --> 01:06:50.767]  You work on fact.
[01:06:50.847 --> 01:06:53.948]  And it's in the eye of the perceiver whether they are scared of it or not.
[01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:55.589]  We are in a battle right now.
[01:06:55.649 --> 01:06:56.630]  We are at the brink.
[01:06:56.810 --> 01:06:59.391]  And self-defense is very different from offense.
[01:06:59.471 --> 01:07:00.332]  I just wanted to say that.
[01:07:00.632 --> 01:07:10.494]  Well, it is scary to say there's a world government that plans to implode economies by design by selling fraudulent derivatives to government and then loaning the government's more fiat money.
[01:07:10.814 --> 01:07:12.714]  It is scary they're putting poison in the water.
[01:07:12.974 --> 01:07:15.975]  It is scary they launched two illegal wars and are about to go into Iran.
[01:07:16.295 --> 01:07:20.816]  It is scary that they're setting up this police state and bringing in foreigners to rule over us.
[01:07:21.176 --> 01:07:26.597]  It is scary that tens of trillions have been stolen and the whole world is on the verge of financial collapse.
[01:07:27.857 --> 01:07:32.919]  Again, that's a child-like mind that thinks that I'm saying something so that creates the fear.
[01:07:33.499 --> 01:07:49.324]  If I live in a valley and a huge dam breaks and the alarms go off saying, get out, you've got five minutes, 30 feet of fast-moving water is coming, it will kill you, am I a fear monger if I get on the radio of a dam broke and told people get to high ground?
[01:07:50.356 --> 01:07:50.916]  No, you're not.
[01:07:50.956 --> 01:07:58.460]  And were those people in the Warsaw Jewish uprising, were they fear mongers for telling the other Jewish people that the Nazis were coming to kill them?
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:04.322]  Were they fear mongers for rising up against the Nazis in a last-bit attempt to save their lives and their friends' lives?
[01:08:04.382 --> 01:08:04.903]  No, they're not.
[01:08:04.943 --> 01:08:11.046]  They were just looking at the truth and acting as a decent, you know, as a kind of conscious human being should.
[01:08:11.206 --> 01:08:15.868]  Versus all the other footage we've seen of Jewish families and others
[01:08:16.488 --> 01:08:29.748]  They'd separate the kids and send them off to be killed, and they'd run the women into pits naked, the men into pits, and shoot them, and the next group, seeing them being herded in to be shot, would still run right in, like gentlemen, to be killed.
[01:08:30.168 --> 01:08:31.410]  That's not going to happen with me.
[01:08:32.131 --> 01:08:33.572]  I'm not running into any pit.
[01:08:34.312 --> 01:08:40.294]  I mean, at the moment of watching people's heads being... And I saw footage from Nigeria about two months ago.
[01:08:40.314 --> 01:08:41.535]  In fact, Burmese has it.
[01:08:41.555 --> 01:08:43.235]  Were you asking to bring us that footage?
[01:08:43.635 --> 01:08:48.177]  And they're bringing people in the middle of the town square, having them lay down, and then shooting them.
[01:08:48.697 --> 01:08:50.838]  And these guys could have run, they could have fought.
[01:08:50.858 --> 01:08:55.880]  I mean, I'm an extremist that I'm saying I'm not going into a pit to be shot.
[01:08:56.946 --> 01:08:57.547]  No, David.
[01:08:57.927 --> 01:08:58.407]  Sorry, Alex.
[01:08:58.447 --> 01:09:07.154]  Yes, I'm actually, I spoke to a lady who ran for, to be a member of Parliament, and she told me that I am on a domestic extremist list.
[01:09:07.534 --> 01:09:12.658]  So I need to have a few days notice if there is going to be a roundup, because they would round me up, of course.
[01:09:13.138 --> 01:09:20.884]  And just like you, I would also do everything I could right now, because in Britain we do not have big trains taking people away to camps.
[01:09:21.285 --> 01:09:22.926]  So right now, the best way I can see us
[01:09:23.366 --> 01:09:27.690]  Fighting this is just to raise awareness and raise the consciousness, raise the humanity.
[01:09:27.851 --> 01:09:31.494]  No, they just slowly arrest people and then you get processed into the jail.
[01:09:31.935 --> 01:09:32.976]  That's how this works now.
[01:09:34.628 --> 01:09:41.554]  Yeah, it is very scary when we realize we are living in those crazy films that we never thought would come true, but this is reality now.
[01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:51.102]  This is actually happening, and I wish people could see this, and I wish people would stop projecting their own fears onto us, saying that we are fearmongers for talking about this.
[01:09:51.182 --> 01:09:53.584]  All we're doing is saying this isn't how it should be.
[01:09:54.104 --> 01:10:01.588]  In the news in England and the US saying they want to be able to arrest us and there be no record of where we went and that we can even be tortured.
[01:10:01.868 --> 01:10:03.729]  Now that's bonafide oppression.
[01:10:04.009 --> 01:10:10.232]  That's bonafide evil to the max and they're trying to sell it as if it's acceptable.
[01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:13.314]  We must speak out against it and the good news is
[01:10:13.874 --> 01:10:15.815]  The people are starting to listen, but I interrupt you.
[01:10:15.855 --> 01:10:18.916]  Go back to this point, because I've been questioned in England.
[01:10:19.337 --> 01:10:22.738]  If you even talk to anybody on the street, that is criminal, because you're all prisoners.
[01:10:23.238 --> 01:10:27.280]  Steve Watson, who lives in London, it's happened to him, going to a concert with his girlfriend.
[01:10:28.301 --> 01:10:33.883]  They do this to everybody now, and describe foreigners in uniform hitting you.
[01:10:34.804 --> 01:10:36.245]  Yeah, I know, it's outrageous.
[01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:51.136]  Yeah, I'm just going through my mind all the different times when police have arrested me under a public order offence for talking about the connection between big business and war, for talking about how only countries with oil seem to get invaded.
[01:10:51.456 --> 01:10:52.577]  And the police lie.
[01:10:52.617 --> 01:10:53.737]  They tell so many lies.
[01:10:53.777 --> 01:10:58.619]  They say, oh, a member of the public is now offended, so now we need to arrest you because you've offended someone.
[01:10:58.679 --> 01:10:59.660]  It's a hate crime.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:04.122]  You know, there's Muslims here on the street and you're talking about a future war with Iran.
[01:11:04.422 --> 01:11:05.342]  We need to arrest you.
[01:11:05.382 --> 01:11:07.943]  This could be a race hate crime and it's just ridiculous.
[01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:08.824]  It is George Orwell's 1984.
[01:11:08.884 --> 01:11:15.506]  Well, they arrested Robin Page seven years ago, BBC reporter, because he used the word homosexual in a speech.
[01:11:15.766 --> 01:11:17.187]  They said that word is hateful.
[01:11:17.787 --> 01:11:19.168]  I mean, this is real.
[01:11:20.225 --> 01:11:20.485]  I know.
[01:11:21.386 --> 01:11:25.832]  It blows my mind, Alex, but all we need to do is just keep doing what's right with zero compromise.
[01:11:25.852 --> 01:11:28.134]  And when you do what's right, the universe will help you.
[01:11:28.154 --> 01:11:30.237]  And for me, what is right is defending freedom.
[01:11:30.637 --> 01:11:33.621]  It's defending that human spirit, which will not bow down.
[01:11:33.661 --> 01:11:36.925]  And I will not bow down before any other man, because I'm a sentient
[01:11:37.325 --> 01:11:37.986]  Well, I mean look at how
[01:11:53.885 --> 01:12:00.190]  5,000 years ago, kings wore crowns, just newer versions of headdresses to say, I'm better than you, I'm the authority.
[01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:11.278]  Same thing with cops, big hats with big glistening signets on them, and logos, and big giant monolithic government buildings to send the message, we're the big government, you're little.
[01:12:11.698 --> 01:12:13.039]  They send that message
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:33.045]  by design to separate the government uh... from the people but but specifically i've seen the videos of this it's almost as seen in new york we are change the cops that can barely speak english from all over the world chinese russian you name it polish uh... mexican they
[01:12:34.085 --> 01:12:37.911]  Literally can't speak English when they walk over and go, turn your camera off!
[01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:39.232]  I take you to jail!
[01:12:39.393 --> 01:12:40.154]  Listen to me!
[01:12:40.775 --> 01:12:44.800]  And the government knowingly is hiring foreigners to do this.
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.643]  That's a big political issue in the U.S.
[01:12:46.723 --> 01:12:47.164]  and England.
[01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:48.666]  We need to start pointing this out.
[01:12:48.706 --> 01:12:50.688]  They're bringing the foreigners in to be our rulers.
[01:12:51.601 --> 01:12:53.043]  Yeah, and they've done this throughout history.
[01:12:53.243 --> 01:13:10.863]  You know, in the Chinese, when the Tiananmen Square thing, you know, China's a country of like 200 different ethnicities, and what they did when they, to Beijing, they brought in farmers, farmer troops from the rural areas who had no problem shooting people who weren't like them, and they do in Britain right now as well, you know, got all these people from different countries.
[01:13:10.903 --> 01:13:12.265]  They don't feel that same, maybe,
[01:13:12.925 --> 01:13:13.586]  Yes, we are.
[01:13:27.962 --> 01:13:50.283]  Sometimes I despair because I can show people like even the people closest to me a lot of my work and they go and so what who cares like it's not really happening because they've been you know dumbed down by Hollywood and they think almost that the paramilitary black uniforms are cool because it's in the Beyonce video Rihanna's got them dancing on stage with her it's it's it's it's incredible and you go down the rabbit hole and you see how it's all connected you start connecting the dots
[01:13:51.528 --> 01:13:55.693]  And you show them government documents where they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines, and they giggle.
[01:13:56.054 --> 01:13:57.956]  And then five years later, they're dying of cancer.
[01:13:57.996 --> 01:13:58.757]  It's still funny!
[01:14:00.599 --> 01:14:02.281]  Because it's a mind trick.
[01:14:02.301 --> 01:14:10.491]  It's Crime Stop from Orwell, where they decide it isn't a threat to them, and so they're part of the power structure.
[01:14:11.485 --> 01:14:11.705]  Yeah.
[01:14:12.186 --> 01:14:15.869]  Alex, I had a very close friend of mine who was doing Love Police films with me.
[01:14:15.909 --> 01:14:20.974]  I'm gonna respect his privacy, but he got arrested and he's got three children.
[01:14:21.475 --> 01:14:31.965]  And the police said, unless you comply with us and bow down and stop doing these films, we will get a psychiatrist here and section you, which means to keep you under the Mental Health Act, you will lose your children.
[01:14:32.285 --> 01:14:36.768]  And that's how they shut him up, and luckily I don't have kids, but it is a psychological battle.
[01:14:37.149 --> 01:14:40.111]  And it makes me despair sometimes, but I am very optimistic.
[01:14:40.211 --> 01:14:41.211]  I know we will win this.
[01:14:41.272 --> 01:14:44.054]  You wouldn't be doing your radio show, I wouldn't be doing my films.
[01:14:44.114 --> 01:14:45.234]  Well, think of that tyranny!
[01:14:45.354 --> 01:14:46.695]  Think of that ultimate tyranny!
[01:14:46.735 --> 01:14:53.060]  It's like Gary Cooper had his son taken, and it was in the police report.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:57.043]  They've taught their children not to trust the government, and the court said, we're taking him!
[01:14:57.802 --> 01:15:00.124]  I mean, you do not question your God.
[01:15:00.384 --> 01:15:01.705]  You don't do that in America.
[01:15:02.225 --> 01:15:04.126]  Since when do you have freedom of speech in America?
[01:15:04.487 --> 01:15:07.569]  You sit down, you shut up, and we're going to take your kids.
[01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:10.370]  But they're already taking them with the water and the food, folks.
[01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:11.231]  They've already got them.
[01:15:11.451 --> 01:15:13.192]  They're already soft-killing them right now.
[01:15:13.533 --> 01:15:18.516]  But the good news is, the people are breaking the spell, and we're not going along with it.
[01:15:18.976 --> 01:15:21.398]  So, I mean, my God, that is Soviet-level tyranny.
[01:15:21.418 --> 01:15:27.642]  So they said, we're going to take your kids if you don't stop going out peacefully and speaking on the streets
[01:15:27.762 --> 01:15:31.506]  Yeah, his main message was everything is okay.
[01:15:31.546 --> 01:15:36.731]  He was a very spiritual man, still is, and he went out there just wanting to lower fear around people.
[01:15:36.851 --> 01:15:41.695]  And they, I don't know if they were physical with him, but they were certainly psychological in a Soviet way.
[01:15:41.735 --> 01:15:49.803]  And actually just this week in Norway, a friend of mine said there's a doctor been thrown in a psychiatric institution for speaking out against the swine flu vaccine.
[01:15:50.143 --> 01:15:52.966]  And Norway is probably, you know, people don't know this, one of the last
[01:15:53.166 --> 01:15:53.606]  Yes, we are.
[01:16:16.232 --> 01:16:19.655]  There's utter chaos, and I, you know, they try and bring about order out of chaos.
[01:16:19.695 --> 01:16:20.956]  That's the Illuminati motto.
[01:16:21.336 --> 01:16:26.019]  I think we need to bring about a bit of peaceful chaos out of their manufactured slave order.
[01:16:26.039 --> 01:16:26.800]  It's the only way.
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:32.824]  We need to get the universe spinning in different ways, because as it stands now, it's not a world I want to bring any children into.
[01:16:32.924 --> 01:16:34.866]  So, you know, gotta do what's right.
[01:16:36.267 --> 01:16:37.267]  Think about that, though.
[01:16:37.307 --> 01:16:37.888]  They told him
[01:16:39.522 --> 01:16:40.923]  People can go watch the videos.
[01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:59.209]  You're not going to go to a town square and talk to people and come up to police and say, we care about you, we're all humans together, we eat at the same restaurants, same grocery stores, our children are growing up, look at this police state, you know, let's care about each other, and that's just, we're taking your kids.
[01:17:00.029 --> 01:17:01.350]  You do not do that!
[01:17:01.530 --> 01:17:03.610]  I mean, you do not talk!
[01:17:04.271 --> 01:17:05.391]  You do not talk!
[01:17:05.751 --> 01:17:07.412]  Think of how evil those police are.
[01:17:08.132 --> 01:17:13.835]  That they think it's okay to terrorize someone for their children.
[01:17:14.095 --> 01:17:17.816]  They think of us literally as sub-human trash.
[01:17:18.277 --> 01:17:24.359]  And notice, as soon as the tyranny comes in, as soon as they've got enough people ready to oppress, the banks just steal everything.
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:31.643]  The system is robbing everyone, reducing us down to just groveling slaves.
[01:17:32.483 --> 01:17:36.667]  We're going to come back, talk to Frank, Mark, Bobby, Seth, and others for the next two short segments.
[01:17:36.688 --> 01:17:41.032]  We've got another guest coming up with big solutions on the state's rights movement and a lot more.
[01:17:41.272 --> 01:17:42.093]  You'll want to stay with us.
[01:17:42.153 --> 01:17:43.695]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:17:48.444 --> 01:17:49.005]  You worry.
[01:17:49.385 --> 01:17:51.107]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:17:51.407 --> 01:17:53.629]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:55.772]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:17:56.032 --> 01:17:57.233]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:17:57.653 --> 01:18:00.857]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:18:01.237 --> 01:18:06.102]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:18:06.482 --> 01:18:09.786]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:18:10.267 --> 01:18:11.608]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:18:11.948 --> 01:18:14.570]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[01:18:14.811 --> 01:18:17.773]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:18:18.133 --> 01:18:26.280]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:30.964]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[01:18:48.055 --> 01:18:52.919]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:18:53.019 --> 01:18:53.800]  What have we got?
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:56.162]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:18:56.462 --> 01:18:57.203]  A republic.
[01:18:57.463 --> 01:19:00.065]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:19:00.125 --> 01:19:02.047]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:19:02.387 --> 01:19:04.289]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:19:04.409 --> 01:19:05.690]  So they think they own our land?
[01:19:06.090 --> 01:19:07.211]  They think they own our water?
[01:19:07.412 --> 01:19:07.812]  Children?
[01:19:08.012 --> 01:19:08.813]  Our education?
[01:19:09.133 --> 01:19:09.774]  Our money?
[01:19:09.974 --> 01:19:13.617]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:19:13.977 --> 01:19:17.641]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[01:19:17.681 --> 01:19:18.622]  You are being warned.
[01:19:18.943 --> 01:19:19.784]  We have the facts.
[01:19:19.984 --> 01:19:21.085]  We have the Constitution.
[01:19:21.145 --> 01:19:22.026]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:19:22.046 --> 01:19:22.867]  We have common law.
[01:19:22.927 --> 01:19:25.170]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:25.455 --> 01:19:29.238]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:19:29.318 --> 01:19:34.121]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:19:34.281 --> 01:19:35.662]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:19:35.802 --> 01:19:36.622]  Don't Tread on Me.
[01:19:36.883 --> 01:19:43.747]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:19:56.127 --> 01:19:58.949]  Chemtrails, the modified atmosphere.
[01:19:59.509 --> 01:20:05.592]  Heavy metals and pesticides, carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[01:20:06.313 --> 01:20:08.834]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[01:20:09.394 --> 01:20:17.059]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:23.222]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[01:20:23.803 --> 01:20:26.987]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[01:20:27.688 --> 01:20:31.032]  Cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.
[01:20:31.572 --> 01:20:36.238]  Order it now for daily intake and stock it now for long term storage.
[01:20:36.759 --> 01:20:39.903]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today!
[01:20:48.627 --> 01:20:51.149]  Sorry.
[01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:56.111]  Don't touch the camera.
[01:20:56.131 --> 01:20:59.532]  What are you doing?
[01:20:59.573 --> 01:21:02.214]  Come this way.
[01:21:02.254 --> 01:21:03.815]  What are you doing?
[01:21:03.835 --> 01:21:04.955]  Don't touch.
[01:21:04.995 --> 01:21:07.416]  Go this way.
[01:21:07.436 --> 01:21:08.157]  Go this way.
[01:21:08.297 --> 01:21:10.898]  You're physically assaulting me.
[01:21:10.978 --> 01:21:13.119]  I love the guido attitude.
[01:21:15.349 --> 01:21:17.010]  Hey, you can't physically assault me.
[01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:17.750]  No, you can't.
[01:21:18.230 --> 01:21:19.031]  I can report you then.
[01:21:19.591 --> 01:21:25.254]  You can't physically assault me.
[01:21:25.314 --> 01:21:26.334]  Yeah, I love it.
[01:21:26.354 --> 01:21:27.495]  You sound like an American now.
[01:21:27.515 --> 01:21:28.275]  Have a nice day.
[01:21:28.455 --> 01:21:40.020]  Video after video.
[01:21:42.822 --> 01:21:47.724]  Of people coming over if you have a camera in public and hitting you, attacking it.
[01:21:48.104 --> 01:21:49.964]  But they don't mind if the government's watching them.
[01:21:49.984 --> 01:21:50.825]  And all over the U.S.
[01:21:50.845 --> 01:21:53.245]  police are arresting people for wiretapping.
[01:21:53.265 --> 01:21:57.547]  And they videotape police in public when there's no perception of privacy.
[01:21:58.127 --> 01:21:58.907]  It's just crazy.
[01:21:58.927 --> 01:22:03.489]  And I've noticed there's these comments over there by people of, you must be an American.
[01:22:03.889 --> 01:22:07.970]  So I guess they said that to you when you were talking to the new Prime Minister during his press conference.
[01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:09.450]  They said, oh shut up American.
[01:22:10.151 --> 01:22:10.571]  So I guess
[01:22:11.331 --> 01:22:13.212]  Calling somebody an American is like a big insult?
[01:22:14.152 --> 01:22:33.379]  Yeah, well what it is Alex, it's from World War II when a lot of the GIs were over in Britain and obviously American men probably a bit more tanned, a bit more muscular than some of the English and so they got lots of English girls and there was a big resentment amongst English men about the Yanks and Bertie Thomas, you know, being very boisterous and having fun and enjoying the women.
[01:22:33.439 --> 01:22:36.540]  So it is a 60-year-old racism against
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:38.761]  It's all about divide and conquer.
[01:22:38.781 --> 01:22:40.582]  Let's go ahead and take a phone call.
[01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:41.482]  Frank in Texas.
[01:22:41.502 --> 01:22:42.143]  You're on the air.
[01:22:42.163 --> 01:22:42.463]  Go ahead.
[01:22:42.483 --> 01:22:42.683]  Yeah.
[01:23:02.506 --> 01:23:03.066]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:23:03.287 --> 01:23:07.769]  Yeah, I know all your info is factual and true, but you guys are really missing the real conspiracy.
[01:23:07.809 --> 01:23:09.751]  We're fighting satanic beings, man.
[01:23:09.971 --> 01:23:14.474]  I mean, real live creatures that you could actually make physical contact with.
[01:23:14.494 --> 01:23:16.195]  You know, my wife said that last night.
[01:23:16.235 --> 01:23:19.697]  We were at dinner and she said, Alex, of course we're being attacked.
[01:23:19.757 --> 01:23:20.858]  Of course you're being attacked.
[01:23:21.178 --> 01:23:23.119]  You're not just fighting the New World Order.
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:26.642]  I mean, you are on a front to the devil.
[01:23:27.362 --> 01:23:30.905]  And, I mean, what else do you call it when the government in the U.S.
[01:23:30.925 --> 01:23:34.448]  grabs over a million kids a year and abuses the daylights out of them?
[01:23:34.488 --> 01:23:41.053]  What else do you call it when they poison the water and the food by design in their own documents to sterilize us and give us cancer?
[01:23:41.854 --> 01:23:45.497]  So, I mean, regardless if you believe in it or not, that's what it is.
[01:23:45.517 --> 01:23:47.559]  It's just pure pit-of-hell evil.
[01:23:47.579 --> 01:23:47.979]  Go ahead.
[01:23:48.299 --> 01:23:49.600]  You can actually see them, though.
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:54.124]  I've seen them 36 times between 1980 and Corpus Christi, it started.
[01:23:54.987 --> 01:23:57.249]  And I won't get into how it all happened.
[01:23:57.349 --> 01:23:58.930]  I got involved with some witches.
[01:24:00.191 --> 01:24:01.852]  Unbeknownst to me, I was a new Christian.
[01:24:02.712 --> 01:24:04.073]  And I opened up myself to them.
[01:24:04.113 --> 01:24:06.795]  I dared a girl to do it that claimed she could conjure demons.
[01:24:07.836 --> 01:24:10.498]  And as a joke on Halloween night, she sicced one on me.
[01:24:10.898 --> 01:24:14.740]  It sounds funny, but it was a big, black, smoky-looking thing.
[01:24:14.781 --> 01:24:16.522]  And it tried to wrap itself around my neck.
[01:24:16.562 --> 01:24:18.363]  And I just called for Jesus, and it took off.
[01:24:18.483 --> 01:24:21.325]  But after that, I made contact with these things.
[01:24:22.046 --> 01:24:22.666]  36 times.
[01:24:22.686 --> 01:24:25.287]  I actually struck one in Amarillo, Texas one night with my fist.
[01:24:26.028 --> 01:24:31.650]  Another time, the last time it was outside Austin at 3.30 in the morning.
[01:24:31.670 --> 01:24:34.871]  Frank, I appreciate your call, but I really don't, I mean, I don't go there.
[01:24:35.311 --> 01:24:39.372]  I only stick to what I can prove and document, but there's a lot of weird stuff going on in this world.
[01:24:39.693 --> 01:24:42.153]  And I know the globalists, they do believe in this.
[01:24:42.594 --> 01:24:45.435]  Almost all the top globalists are Luciferians.
[01:24:45.955 --> 01:24:48.556]  Any comments on that from our guest, Charlie?
[01:24:49.551 --> 01:24:50.211]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:24:50.732 --> 01:24:54.695]  My favorite inspirer is actually another Texan like yourself, Bill Hicks.
[01:24:54.775 --> 01:24:58.497]  He talked a lot about the people at the top doing things with Satan.
[01:24:58.978 --> 01:25:05.582]  And to me, whether they are real demons in this universe or whatever, the metaphor of calling them Satanists is correct.
[01:25:05.602 --> 01:25:07.744]  But let's not forget, a lot of the guys at the top, the elite,
[01:25:08.244 --> 01:25:10.845]  They are atheists in the Christian monotheistic sense.
[01:25:11.005 --> 01:25:17.068]  They believe in another religion, which they will take energy, lots of dark energy and fear, and then use it.
[01:25:17.108 --> 01:25:19.168]  But it's just a sign of their sick mind.
[01:25:19.569 --> 01:25:22.070]  Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:23.690]  But they call them Satanists?
[01:25:23.710 --> 01:25:25.171]  They're just pathetic people.
[01:25:26.071 --> 01:25:26.952]  Stay there, got to brush.
[01:25:29.533 --> 01:25:31.353]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:25:33.034 --> 01:25:35.235]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:41.013]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:25:41.413 --> 01:25:46.379]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:48.482]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:25:48.802 --> 01:25:53.627]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:25:53.808 --> 01:25:54.769]  How much do you want?
[01:25:54.989 --> 01:25:55.710]  When do you want it?
[01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:57.691]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:25:57.972 --> 01:25:58.792]  When will you need it?
[01:25:59.053 --> 01:26:01.114]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:26:01.254 --> 01:26:02.355]  Will there be any food?
[01:26:02.596 --> 01:26:03.917]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:26:04.117 --> 01:26:09.181]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:26:09.381 --> 01:26:12.524]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:26:12.964 --> 01:26:16.467]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:26:16.787 --> 01:26:17.768]  How much will you need?
[01:26:18.008 --> 01:26:18.629]  We don't know.
[01:26:18.909 --> 01:26:19.830]  How much do you want?
[01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:20.751]  All you can get.
[01:26:20.951 --> 01:26:21.812]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:26:22.052 --> 01:26:24.814]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:26:25.094 --> 01:26:26.856]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:26:26.876 --> 01:26:27.797]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:26:40.797 --> 01:26:42.701]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:43.182 --> 01:26:45.947]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:53.268 --> 01:27:02.397]  We've got an author coming up to discuss the State Bank of North Dakota and more on how to take our monetary system back from the offshore bankers.
[01:27:02.897 --> 01:27:10.945]  We're in our final segment with Charlie Veach and we've got links up to his website at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:27:11.445 --> 01:27:13.146]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you, Charlie.
[01:27:13.306 --> 01:27:16.608]  Listen, Alex, to me, what's happening here is this is an attack
[01:27:40.618 --> 01:27:44.360]  It's an attack on the seed of who we are as human beings.
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:47.001]  It's an attack on our consciousness.
[01:27:47.481 --> 01:27:50.503]  It's an attack, they're attacking the DNA of who we are.
[01:27:50.883 --> 01:27:53.304]  They're seeking to attack the food DNA.
[01:27:53.644 --> 01:27:58.246]  They're seeking to attack the DNA of our laws, of a free republic.
[01:27:58.526 --> 01:27:59.487]  Yeah, they're playing God.
[01:27:59.527 --> 01:28:03.729]  They're rewriting the universe in their Hellraiser image.
[01:28:04.969 --> 01:28:10.312]  So to me, they might be the great deceivers, but we are the great perceivers.
[01:28:10.802 --> 01:28:16.504]  And you are leading that, along with others like yourself, Charlie, and others around the globe.
[01:28:16.664 --> 01:28:20.026]  We have to wake up and wake up our perceptions.
[01:28:21.446 --> 01:28:30.470]  To me, it's about learning how to see, learning how to perceive, not only with our eyes, but with all of our being, our consciousness.
[01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:33.131]  We have many abilities, many talents, many gifts.
[01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:34.055]  I think?
[01:28:50.646 --> 01:28:53.010]  Altering our DNA through the toxins, that's admitted.
[01:28:53.310 --> 01:28:55.153]  Human DNA is now changing rapidly.
[01:28:55.453 --> 01:28:56.515]  They are poisoning us.
[01:28:56.795 --> 01:28:58.217]  The world government's only the beginning.
[01:28:58.237 --> 01:28:58.978]  They want to get rid of us.
[01:28:59.359 --> 01:29:01.341]  And in closing, that was a great call, Mark.
[01:29:02.082 --> 01:29:04.926]  I want you to, you know, speak to what he was just saying.
[01:29:06.109 --> 01:29:07.330]  Yeah, absolutely, Alex.
[01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:15.475]  It's an ongoing battle between left brain and right brain, between the machine hearts and machine minds and the spiritual, alive human beings.
[01:29:15.535 --> 01:29:20.779]  The machine men, they hate us because they are so jealous of the love that we have in our hearts.
[01:29:21.219 --> 01:29:26.863]  They are so jealous of the fact that we don't give up, that we actually stand for truth and for each other.
[01:29:27.003 --> 01:29:31.206]  So they will always try and control us because they don't understand us.
[01:29:31.306 --> 01:29:32.707]  And, you know, fear leads to anger.
[01:29:32.847 --> 01:29:33.707]  Anger leads to hate.
[01:29:33.808 --> 01:29:34.948]  Hate leads to suffering.
[01:29:35.288 --> 01:29:35.969]  They fear us.
[01:29:36.069 --> 01:29:37.170]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[01:29:37.230 --> 01:29:38.151]  Fellow thought criminal today.
[01:30:04.947 --> 01:30:33.003]  Listen, I wanted to ask your guest from England if he thinks that they have something kind of like we do here in the Western states like North and South Com and how did England go from kind of being a, you know, what happened to us back in the 80s where we were worried about the Communists and all of a sudden it just kind of flips over and turns against the people because I think it happened there faster.
[01:30:33.795 --> 01:30:35.857]  Where the state kind of turned against the people.
[01:30:35.877 --> 01:30:47.109]  Well, they started a lot of that by staging terror attacks, blaming it on the IRA, and we're going to keep you safe, and then political correctness, but I appreciate your comments on that quickly.
[01:30:47.998 --> 01:30:49.579]  Well, the way they do it is the way they've always done it.
[01:30:49.639 --> 01:30:50.580]  It's mainstream media.
[01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:52.742]  Just keep repetition, repetition, repetition.
[01:30:52.782 --> 01:30:57.945]  Just, you know, tell people about climate change and that human beings are the problem, you know, that we're pathetic.
[01:30:58.005 --> 01:30:59.427]  And the Hollywood as well.
[01:30:59.467 --> 01:31:02.389]  And also, you know, British film is Hollywood films nowadays.
[01:31:02.409 --> 01:31:06.192]  Just keep reminding people that they're worthless, that they are the biggest problem.
[01:31:06.212 --> 01:31:08.894]  And in all the newspapers, you don't get good news on the newspaper.
[01:31:08.934 --> 01:31:11.916]  You hear about rape, war, famine, stabbings, murder.
[01:31:12.396 --> 01:31:15.697]  And you know, people start to think, oh my God, we are terrible creatures.
[01:31:15.757 --> 01:31:18.178]  Thank God we have these elites to look after us.
[01:31:18.238 --> 01:31:21.519]  And it's just, it's a propaganda war as your channel, Alex.
[01:31:21.599 --> 01:31:22.419]  It's an info war.
[01:31:23.919 --> 01:31:25.260]  Charlie Beach of the Love Police.
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:27.020]  Look forward to talking to you again in the future.
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.921]  Keep up the great work and folks can contact you and get involved in what you're doing.
[01:31:31.462 --> 01:31:34.542]  Or they can roll over and get scared and give in to these people.
[01:31:34.963 --> 01:31:37.863]  We're about getting past the fear and taking action.
[01:31:38.324 --> 01:31:38.984]  We'll be right back.
[01:31:39.004 --> 01:31:39.424]  Stay with us.
[01:31:47.804 --> 01:31:49.064]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:49.104 --> 01:31:54.446]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:31:54.686 --> 01:31:59.307]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:31:59.707 --> 01:32:04.768]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:32:05.268 --> 01:32:07.109]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:32:07.369 --> 01:32:07.869]  We're good to go!
[01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:37.172]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:38.354 --> 01:32:44.141]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:44.462 --> 01:32:46.845]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:49.383 --> 01:32:53.004]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.324 --> 01:33:01.465]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.

[01:33:47.389 --> 01:33:51.331]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:33:51.571 --> 01:33:57.615]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:33:57.975 --> 01:34:05.079]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:34:05.359 --> 01:34:09.922]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:34:10.222 --> 01:34:18.727]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:34:18.888 --> 01:34:22.690]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:34:23.150 --> 01:34:29.374]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:34:29.915 --> 01:34:33.277]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:34:33.797 --> 01:34:35.618]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091.

[01:34:46.126 --> 01:34:46.586]  Thank you.
[01:34:48.387 --> 01:34:53.431]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:53.791 --> 01:34:56.033]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:34:57.887 --> 01:35:10.302]  Interspersed throughout the last 52 minutes of broadcast today, I'm going to hit on other important market news, police state news, military news that I haven't gotten to yet with our guest.
[01:35:11.043 --> 01:35:16.569]  And we're also going to continue with taking some of your phone calls today.
[01:35:18.117 --> 01:35:38.615]  But I've got a lot of calls about this the last four or five months and it certainly is just another good alternative and an idea out there of having state chartered banks that aren't run by offshore banks that create derivatives and then loan it basically to pension funds and governments and private investors.
[01:35:39.255 --> 01:35:43.497]  And to understand that, you've got to identify the private, run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[01:35:43.537 --> 01:35:44.577]  I mean, it's just that simple.
[01:35:45.557 --> 01:35:49.939]  Because the Bank of England is the same system, the EU, Central Bank is the same system.
[01:35:50.539 --> 01:36:05.605]  This is the global private cartel that is taking control of the planet through the fact that they can just create all the money they want for themselves, all of the assets, all of the credit that they want.
[01:36:07.074 --> 01:36:08.855]  And this is the group setting up world government.
[01:36:08.875 --> 01:36:10.276]  This is the group erasing borders.
[01:36:10.316 --> 01:36:12.278]  This is the group that owns both political parties.
[01:36:12.638 --> 01:36:16.441]  This is the group that runs Goldman Sachs in every major regulatory position.
[01:36:17.121 --> 01:36:18.562]  With the foxes guarding the hen house.
[01:36:18.582 --> 01:36:21.565]  With Elena Kagan saying she wants your free speech.
[01:36:21.625 --> 01:36:22.585]  She wants your guns.
[01:36:22.946 --> 01:36:24.187]  She's a Goldman Sachs member.
[01:36:25.307 --> 01:36:27.969]  And she's written several books.
[01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:31.472]  Ellenbrown.com is her website.
[01:36:32.312 --> 01:36:33.713]  She's an attorney.
[01:36:34.734 --> 01:36:37.336]  In Los Angeles, of course, written Web of Debt.
[01:36:37.977 --> 01:36:40.218]  And she also has written some interesting articles.
[01:36:40.698 --> 01:36:43.561]  Cash-starved states need to play the banking game.
[01:36:44.001 --> 01:36:46.202]  North Dakota shows how.
[01:36:46.563 --> 01:36:48.704]  So we'll talk about that state bank.
[01:36:49.825 --> 01:36:51.666]  And here's a quote from Frances Bacon.
[01:36:51.726 --> 01:36:56.550]  He that will not apply new remedies must expect new evils.
[01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:59.452]  For time is the greatest innovator.
[01:37:00.253 --> 01:37:02.534]  And she joins us now.
[01:37:02.594 --> 01:37:03.295]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:37:05.664 --> 01:37:15.411]  Tell us a little bit about yourself for those who just joined us, break down your take on the banking cartel, where we are economically worldwide right now, what you see happening there, and then let's talk about a solution.
[01:37:16.071 --> 01:37:34.603]  It isn't a perfect solution, it won't fix everything, but instead of having a private fellow reserve, I mean even if the Feds won't get control, even if the Congress won't take control of the issuance of currency and credit as they are commanded to in the Constitution, we can move at the state level as part of the states' rights movement to set up state banks.
[01:37:34.623 --> 01:37:35.324]  So let's go through it.
[01:37:35.804 --> 01:37:48.172]  Exactly, that's where I think we have the most opportunity to get a foot in the doors at the state level, because Congress is totally bought and paid for by Wall Street.
[01:37:48.613 --> 01:37:51.054]  But the states are desperate.
[01:37:51.755 --> 01:37:58.939]  They have to balance their budgets, unlike the federal government, which is $13 trillion in debt and just keeps going.
[01:37:59.079 --> 01:38:01.761]  I mean, they haven't paid off the federal debt since 1838.
[01:38:04.656 --> 01:38:10.320]  But the states are required to balance their budgets, and they're all in the red except one state.
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:13.482]  There's only one solvent state at the moment, and that's North Dakota.
[01:38:13.842 --> 01:38:21.868]  Actually, Montana is solvent at the moment, but by 2011 they project that they're going to be in the red, so they're going to have to
[01:38:23.394 --> 01:38:26.957]  And the big central banks are doing the same thing they've done in hundreds of third world nations.
[01:38:27.017 --> 01:38:34.742]  They go in, they get the countries in debt so they can then be economically subservient to the banking cartel that makes the money out of nothing.
[01:38:35.002 --> 01:38:36.563]  And so you have all these unfunded mandates.
[01:38:36.603 --> 01:38:37.784]  The states are going bankrupt.
[01:38:38.044 --> 01:38:39.245]  What does the federal government do?
[01:38:39.605 --> 01:38:41.227]  Even more unfunded mandates.
[01:38:41.587 --> 01:38:44.989]  And then as things go completely bankrupt, the feds just absorb the states.
[01:38:45.049 --> 01:38:51.334]  So the states have got to rebel through their 9th and 10th Amendment powers now or never reverse this.
[01:38:52.301 --> 01:38:52.601]  Right.
[01:38:52.921 --> 01:38:57.844]  All of our money actually is created by banks in the form of loans.
[01:38:57.924 --> 01:38:59.765]  That's my book, Web of Debt.
[01:38:59.805 --> 01:39:04.067]  That's the basic premise, the thing that most people don't realize.
[01:39:04.127 --> 01:39:09.550]  Most people think the government creates money and that it's the government's fault that we have all these troubles.
[01:39:09.610 --> 01:39:13.432]  But if the government did create money, why are they $13 trillion in debt?
[01:39:13.912 --> 01:39:15.313]  In fact, it all comes from banks.
[01:39:15.911 --> 01:39:18.832]  Yeah, Kennedy issued some of our own money and got his head blown off.
[01:39:18.872 --> 01:39:21.572]  The last president to do it, of course, was Lincoln.
[01:39:21.592 --> 01:39:23.233]  For those that don't know, that's a good place to start.
[01:39:23.753 --> 01:39:26.653]  Explain to them how fractional reserve banking works.
[01:39:26.693 --> 01:39:29.014]  And now with derivatives, it's not even fractional.
[01:39:29.034 --> 01:39:30.154]  They just make up whatever they want.
[01:39:30.634 --> 01:39:31.594]  Right.
[01:39:31.694 --> 01:39:43.357]  Fractional reserve lending goes back to the 17th century when the goldsmiths would take people's gold for safekeeping and nobody really wanted to carry around this heavy, dangerous gold.
[01:39:44.249 --> 01:40:00.898]  The Goldsmiths gave them little paper receipts that later evolved into banknotes, and they soon discovered that they could lend ten times as many banknotes as they actually had gold, because people would only come for their gold ten percent of the time.
[01:40:01.378 --> 01:40:04.760]  So that was the origin of our ten percent fractional reserve system.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:09.823]  We still have the ten percent, even though there's no longer any gold in the system.
[01:40:10.996 --> 01:40:20.143]  Roughly true that people come for their money, come to the bank about 10% of the time and 90% of the time they leave their money in the bank.
[01:40:20.163 --> 01:40:25.247]  So banks are able to leverage their deposits by about a factor of 10.
[01:40:26.148 --> 01:40:30.631]  In other words, they can lend many times more money than they actually have.
[01:40:31.191 --> 01:40:33.633]  And that's how credit is created.
[01:40:33.713 --> 01:40:37.376]  Well, in fact, today banks don't even look at their reserves.
[01:40:37.416 --> 01:40:39.618]  They don't pay any attention to what deposits they have.
[01:40:40.106 --> 01:40:41.067]  When they make a loan.
[01:40:41.147 --> 01:40:49.671]  If a good borrower, say a good client, a corporate top client, comes to the bank and wants a loan, the bank just writes it into their account.
[01:40:50.391 --> 01:40:52.572]  And then it worries about the reserves later.
[01:40:52.592 --> 01:40:58.455]  So, let's say you came in and you wanted a half a million dollar loan to buy a house.
[01:40:59.076 --> 01:41:07.880]  And you would sign a mortgage and the bank counts that as a negotiable instrument that's an asset to themselves because you have promised to pay
[01:41:08.584 --> 01:41:09.224]  That's great.
[01:41:29.557 --> 01:41:34.503]  So that's where the money comes from, that liability, where you're allowed to write checks.
[01:41:34.623 --> 01:41:46.037]  That's the origin of all the money that circulates in the economy, except for coins, which now compose only 1 ten-thousandth of the total money supply, the M3 money supply.
[01:41:48.268 --> 01:42:04.638]  And as the public begins to learn that gold and silver is real money versus crud paper that's being devalued globally across the board, not just our currency, you're going to see, as people rush into gold, its price go up according to all the laws of economics.
[01:42:05.899 --> 01:42:07.680]  Well, true.
[01:42:08.507 --> 01:42:11.409]  And I myself am a heavy believer in gold and silver.
[01:42:11.869 --> 01:42:16.713]  But right now, our entire money system is a series of legal agreements.
[01:42:16.733 --> 01:42:17.913]  There's nothing behind it.
[01:42:18.094 --> 01:42:22.216]  And it's actually not that bad of a system, except for the fact that it's privately owned.
[01:42:23.337 --> 01:42:28.100]  We have private bankers pretending to have money.
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:29.321]  That's what Jefferson said.
[01:42:29.341 --> 01:42:37.327]  Thomas Jefferson said, when he figured this out, like 20 years after the Continental Congress, and he figured out that
[01:42:38.832 --> 01:42:40.173]  The first U.S.
[01:42:40.233 --> 01:42:42.394]  bank was just pretending to have money.
[01:42:42.474 --> 01:42:46.695]  So he called them bold and bankrupt adventurers, just pretending to have money.
[01:42:47.255 --> 01:42:57.059]  We had been tricked by them into giving them the power to issue our currency, so that banks still have the power to issue our currency and lend it to us.
[01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:06.323]  But if we're a publicly owned bank, so that the interest went back to the public, then it would be a mathematically sustainable
[01:43:07.068 --> 01:43:09.430]  And that's what the Constitution states it should be.
[01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:15.073]  But if the Feds won't do it, we're trying to audit the Fed and having more success, we can still go to the state level.
[01:43:15.473 --> 01:43:17.995]  Now here's a quote out of a local paper in North Dakota.
[01:43:18.015 --> 01:43:21.337]  It says, North Dakota is a sparsely populated state of less than 700,000.
[01:43:22.898 --> 01:43:26.561]  Known for cold weather, isolated farmers, and the hit movie Fargo.
[01:43:26.621 --> 01:43:31.685]  Yet, for some reason, it defies the real estate cliche of location, location, location.
[01:43:32.105 --> 01:43:39.932]  Since 2000, the state's GMP gross product has grown 56%, personal income has grown 43%, and wages have grown 34%.
[01:43:42.754 --> 01:43:47.397]  This year, the state has a budget surplus of 1.2 billion dollars.
[01:43:47.977 --> 01:43:52.540]  And you believe, from your research, a lot of that has to do with it having a state bank.
[01:43:53.221 --> 01:43:56.683]  Break that down and explain the difference between a state bank and, say, J.P.
[01:43:56.723 --> 01:43:57.003]  Morgan.
[01:43:58.104 --> 01:43:59.985]  Well, this would be a state-owned bank.
[01:44:00.065 --> 01:44:02.407]  Of course, all states have state banks.
[01:44:02.467 --> 01:44:04.008]  I mean a state-owned bank.
[01:44:04.028 --> 01:44:05.769]  A state-owned bank.
[01:44:05.809 --> 01:44:08.911]  North Dakota is the only state that owns its own bank.
[01:44:09.552 --> 01:44:10.492]  And it's owned it since 1919.
[01:44:12.333 --> 01:44:16.474]  It was set up under circumstances very similar to what we have today.
[01:44:16.494 --> 01:44:17.735]  It was a populist movement.
[01:44:17.755 --> 01:44:20.416]  The farmers were losing their farms to the Wall Street bankers.
[01:44:21.016 --> 01:44:38.281]  And when they realized that their money was going out of state and that it was actually being fraudulently taken, that the farmers were not being able to sell their perfectly good grain to the granaries, which were a cartel with the railroads, which were a cartel with the banks.
[01:44:38.461 --> 01:44:39.962]  It was all one big cartel.
[01:44:40.971 --> 01:44:41.592]  I don't know.
[01:45:05.333 --> 01:45:19.358]  We could have the same sort of flourishing GDP that they have, but we are all suffering from a credit crisis that was precipitated in Wall Street because the Wall Street Bank got in trouble with their dodgy collateral, etc.
[01:45:19.478 --> 01:45:22.619]  So, North Dakota just escaped all that.
[01:45:22.839 --> 01:45:30.082]  By law, all the state revenues go into the Bank of North Dakota, so they have a huge potential deposit base.
[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:31.200]  I don't
[01:45:51.094 --> 01:45:56.416]  So they have the fractional reserve power to empower the people and that way the money stays in the state.
[01:45:56.797 --> 01:46:06.501]  It's not sold into derivatives to Thailand or to Russia or to England and so you have sovereignty and you have transparency instead of
[01:46:07.381 --> 01:46:13.024]  The state of Texas takes most of the tax money invested in secretive funds and derivatives.
[01:46:13.504 --> 01:46:17.166]  And in the comprehensive annual financial report show, they've got a double set of books.
[01:46:17.867 --> 01:46:23.569]  And that was okay, though it gave the bankers great power, the private bankers, when the derivatives were on the way up.
[01:46:23.610 --> 01:46:26.831]  But now the states are all bankrupt because the bankers set them up.
[01:46:26.911 --> 01:46:29.753]  They swindled all the tax money investments.
[01:46:30.953 --> 01:46:33.876]  And so now we're defunct just where the bankers wanted us.
[01:46:34.236 --> 01:46:39.760]  So in this big states' rights movement, we need to move to have other states look at state banks.
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:44.183]  That is, where the state's money is in a public bank.
[01:46:45.004 --> 01:46:45.444]  Stay there.
[01:46:45.664 --> 01:46:46.205]  We'll be right back.
[01:46:48.311 --> 01:46:53.173]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:46:53.273 --> 01:46:54.073]  What have we got?
[01:46:54.274 --> 01:46:56.394]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:46:56.715 --> 01:46:57.475]  A republic.
[01:46:57.735 --> 01:47:00.296]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:47:00.376 --> 01:47:02.297]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:47:02.637 --> 01:47:04.558]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:47:04.678 --> 01:47:05.939]  So they think they own our land?
[01:47:06.359 --> 01:47:07.459]  They think they own our water?
[01:47:07.679 --> 01:47:08.059]  Children?
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:09.060]  Our education?
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:10.020]  Our money?
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:13.882]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:47:14.241 --> 01:47:18.942]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:47:19.202 --> 01:47:20.043]  We have the facts.
[01:47:20.223 --> 01:47:21.343]  We have the Constitution.
[01:47:21.403 --> 01:47:22.283]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:47:22.303 --> 01:47:23.143]  We have common law.
[01:47:23.184 --> 01:47:25.444]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:48:50.307 --> 01:48:50.567]  May 20th, 2010.

[01:49:10.555 --> 01:49:14.479]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:19.465]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:49:19.726 --> 01:49:25.813]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks,

[01:49:48.894 --> 01:49:51.518]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:49:51.918 --> 01:49:56.885]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:49:57.245 --> 01:49:58.988]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:49:59.308 --> 01:50:03.794]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:50:03.814 --> 01:50:04.094]  We're good.
[01:50:24.346 --> 01:50:24.706]  We're good!
[01:50:50.208 --> 01:50:54.231]  All right, Ellen, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, but this is so important.
[01:50:54.772 --> 01:51:03.398]  I know it's not basketball or football or getting drunk for new listeners out there that may be tuning in, but it's getting control of our lives.
[01:51:03.718 --> 01:51:07.882]  If we let offshore banks have the power to issue all the currency and credit they want,
[01:51:08.382 --> 01:51:12.866]  They're going to take over, and they have, and announce themselves our rulers and a new empire.
[01:51:13.247 --> 01:51:16.010]  And they're very corrupt, wicked people who also believe in eugenics.
[01:51:16.530 --> 01:51:19.993]  So we must take our states back to get our federal government back.
[01:51:20.454 --> 01:51:24.438]  And the example of North Dakota is a great case point example.
[01:51:24.778 --> 01:51:26.980]  Now, you've written about this in your book.
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:28.761]  You've got webofdebt.com.
[01:51:29.462 --> 01:51:32.484]  Let's walk through what a state bank is.
[01:51:32.544 --> 01:51:40.210]  Not a state charter bank, but a bank of the state that's transparent and how this could be rolled out in other states.
[01:51:41.551 --> 01:51:53.120]  In North Dakota, as I mentioned, all of the revenues of the state go into the bank and then those become the deposits, plus they take depositors from individuals.
[01:51:53.672 --> 01:51:54.492]  Or take deposits.
[01:51:54.732 --> 01:52:21.481]  So, you know, the way banking works, the bank just makes loans to anybody it wants to make loans to, but then when the checks go out of the bank, they have to clear through a clearing house, usually the Federal Reserve, but the Bank of North Dakota isn't actually a member of the... Well, I guess they are a member, but they don't have FDIC insurance, and they don't use it.
[01:52:22.335 --> 01:52:31.701]  So anyway, the checks have to clear by, you have to have the same amount going in in the way of deposits as you have going out.
[01:52:31.761 --> 01:52:36.845]  As far as I can see, that's really just a ruse to make it look like you're not creating money on your books.
[01:52:37.105 --> 01:52:49.153]  Because those deposits coming in, like Mr. Smith, the check that just came in, is not the money that Mr. Jones has going out in the form of a check.
[01:52:49.193 --> 01:52:52.195]  In other words, Mr. Smith never said that Mr. Jones could
[01:52:52.777 --> 01:52:53.137]  I don't know.
[01:53:10.831 --> 01:53:21.877]  Well, the goldsmiths discovered 500 years ago that they would hold your gold, because you didn't want to keep it in your house, and then they could give you the receipts, and that no one hardly ever came in at once wanting all their gold.
[01:53:22.337 --> 01:53:25.118]  And even if a few people did, you still had enough, so that's what allowed it.
[01:53:25.158 --> 01:53:35.644]  But explain to people how a state bank like North Dakota has empowers the people, and how it works, and how it's different from the system that the private bankers have.
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:40.943]  Okay, in North Dakota, the state bank is actually pretty much a banker's bank.
[01:53:40.983 --> 01:53:46.386]  They do make some commercial loans, but mostly they are partnering with the other banks.
[01:53:46.887 --> 01:54:00.935]  So, where all the other state banks have a capital problem because of the Bank for International Settlement's capital requirements and the fact that they had this dodgy collateral on their books that froze
[01:54:02.751 --> 01:54:03.271]  We're good to go.
[01:54:30.031 --> 01:54:31.411]  So that froze up credit.
[01:54:31.571 --> 01:54:42.434]  Well, in North Dakota, the Bank of North Dakota serves as the, it partners with those banks and it takes the loans off their books, making room for more and more.
[01:54:42.954 --> 01:54:55.797]  So, generally, the community banks, the local banks, are dealing directly with customers and then the Bank of North Dakota backstops those banks, rather like the Federal Reserve does.
[01:54:55.817 --> 01:54:57.377]  It's sort of like the mini-Fed.
[01:54:58.121 --> 01:55:02.723]  Yeah, it's the insurance policy, but not just the Bank of North Dakota.
[01:55:02.763 --> 01:55:10.146]  We see local state banks that are private being much more healthy than the big mega banks that created these derivatives.
[01:55:10.546 --> 01:55:19.690]  And under the new bank re-regulation legislation, actually written by Goldman Sachs and others, it allows them to come in and take over the healthy state or regional banks.
[01:55:20.570 --> 01:55:23.912]  So we see a major consolidation taking place here.
[01:55:24.755 --> 01:55:25.395]  Right.
[01:55:25.555 --> 01:55:33.778]  So that if you have a state bank, it can help those struggling little banks that are struggling with, that now they're talking about raising the capital requirement.
[01:55:33.798 --> 01:55:37.440]  They're making it even more difficult for the little local banks.
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:39.200]  And so the state bank can help with that.
[01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:45.142]  One major advantage is that all the interest goes back to the state.
[01:55:45.362 --> 01:55:50.804]  So, so in North Dakota, it's actually a big moneymaker for the state.
[01:55:50.844 --> 01:55:52.405]  They get a big dividend every year.
[01:55:52.932 --> 01:55:56.115]  So that reduces the amount of taxes that people have to pay.
[01:55:56.896 --> 01:56:02.461]  But plus, it's got a mission statement that is geared toward helping the state.
[01:56:02.741 --> 01:56:07.865]  So where a private bank, like any corporation, has to serve its shareholders.
[01:56:07.945 --> 01:56:11.809]  So if Goldman Sachs can make more money speculating in derivatives,
[01:56:12.378 --> 01:56:17.580]  Then in making commercial loans to businesses that might go bankrupt, they have to speculate.
[01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:19.001]  That's what their business model is.
[01:56:19.041 --> 01:56:21.682]  They have to serve their private shareholders.
[01:56:21.702 --> 01:56:29.365]  And they have lobbyists at the state level getting the state to invest tax money in their system, giving them more power.
[01:56:29.785 --> 01:56:30.165]  Stay there.
[01:56:30.265 --> 01:56:36.688]  Let's come back and talk about how we roll this out in other states and if you're starting to see this being discussed in other states.
[01:56:38.369 --> 01:56:39.329]  We're on the march.
[01:56:39.769 --> 01:56:41.270]  The empire's on the run.
[01:56:42.290 --> 01:56:45.032]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:47.554 --> 01:56:50.957]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:56:51.778 --> 01:56:52.678]  Tyranny is here.
[01:56:53.039 --> 01:56:56.581]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:56:56.741 --> 01:56:59.183]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:56:59.203 --> 01:57:04.648]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:57:05.068 --> 01:57:11.313]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:57:11.713 --> 01:57:17.257]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:57:17.657 --> 01:57:21.379]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.

[01:57:32.106 --> 01:57:35.068]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:57:35.668 --> 01:57:37.089]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:57:37.649 --> 01:57:38.070]  It's here.

[02:02:19.649 --> 02:02:20.891]  Greek strikers march on
[02:02:22.042 --> 02:02:22.442]  I think so.
[02:02:40.438 --> 02:02:52.814]  The list just goes on and on and on of what is happening in this nation and how things are just deteriorating so quickly as the lawless criminals at every level of government
[02:02:53.916 --> 02:02:57.298]  We just have open season on our Republic.
[02:02:57.338 --> 02:02:58.758]  Here's another one out of the Denver Post.
[02:02:59.439 --> 02:03:03.020]  Douglas County votes to charge fees for school bus rides.
[02:03:03.421 --> 02:03:04.841]  Then you read what it's for.
[02:03:05.341 --> 02:03:11.685]  A $2 million program to make the kids have biometric ID cards they swipe and to GPS the school buses.
[02:03:12.305 --> 02:03:18.268]  So there's no money for the roads and the sidewalks, but there's money for these security companies to set up this prison grid.
[02:03:19.108 --> 02:03:20.069]  Here's another key article.
[02:03:20.169 --> 02:03:23.672]  Feds move to throw pot smokers in prison for impaired driving.
[02:03:23.732 --> 02:03:24.953]  CurtinMoInfoWars.com.
[02:03:25.193 --> 02:03:31.818]  And it actually has a link to the National Drug Policy Strategy saying that they're going to have warrantless blood checkpoints.
[02:03:31.838 --> 02:03:32.759]  You've heard about those.
[02:03:33.139 --> 02:03:36.742]  And that they can find marijuana for up to 100 days.
[02:03:36.842 --> 02:03:37.402]  Generally just 30.
[02:03:37.582 --> 02:03:42.226]  And that of any cannabis that over 80% of the public reportedly smokes from time to time.
[02:03:42.466 --> 02:03:44.788]  I guess I'm part of the 20% that rarely smokes pot.
[02:03:44.848 --> 02:03:45.709]  I've smoked it here and there.
[02:03:46.209 --> 02:03:49.572]  Don't really like it, but the issue is, it doesn't matter.
[02:03:50.212 --> 02:03:51.573]  They're just going to take your blood.
[02:03:52.194 --> 02:03:56.037]  You've got all these universities saying, you've got to give us DNA to get into the university.
[02:03:57.017 --> 02:04:00.780]  It's just so incredible that now they're going to take your blood.
[02:04:01.761 --> 02:04:07.265]  at checkpoints and or a cheek swab and if they find THC, prison time!
[02:04:07.945 --> 02:04:09.046]  Prison time!
[02:04:10.207 --> 02:04:11.788]  So you smoked pot a hundred days ago?
[02:04:11.828 --> 02:04:14.209]  Doesn't matter, you're going to prison.
[02:04:14.729 --> 02:04:15.490]  Here's one, U.S.
[02:04:15.550 --> 02:04:18.612]  state's pension funds becoming federal issue.
[02:04:18.632 --> 02:04:22.675]  It talks about state pension funds going bankrupt because they invested them in derivatives.
[02:04:23.015 --> 02:04:27.197]  Don't worry, the feds are going to take it over and only give you part of your money back.
[02:04:27.698 --> 02:04:30.800]  Folks, it's happened everywhere else and it's happening here.
[02:04:32.216 --> 02:04:33.798]  People better get their priorities straight.
[02:04:35.159 --> 02:04:38.663]  Going back to Ellen Brown, the website is webofdebt.com.
[02:04:38.683 --> 02:04:41.647]  She's got a great book out on the subject of the Federal Reserve.
[02:04:42.448 --> 02:04:48.895]  But then another important article, Cash Strap States Need to Play the Banking Game, North Dakota Shows How.
[02:04:49.156 --> 02:04:50.597]  Let's say you were on national news.
[02:04:52.299 --> 02:04:59.942]  Ellen, and you had five minutes to explain this, the basic bullet points, why it's important, what the alternative means, going with the offshore bankers.
[02:04:59.962 --> 02:05:09.767]  I mean, if you had five minutes to just nail it and to crystallize why this is such a great avenue to financial liberty and sovereignty and freedom, what would you say?
[02:05:11.147 --> 02:05:14.349]  Well, we still have a credit freeze on in all the states.
[02:05:14.569 --> 02:05:17.550]  And if you own your own bank, you can create credit.
[02:05:18.030 --> 02:05:19.331]  And states have a huge
[02:05:19.974 --> 02:05:43.873]  Deposit and capital base with which they can Leverage their money and create credit so they could find many things that we think we don't have the money for now like infrastructure and education and low-cost housing Plus the states are paying well in California We're paying an average of four point seven percent interest on our debt if you're a bank banks borrow from each other at the federal funds rates
[02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:47.171]  Of 0 to 0.25 percent.
[02:05:47.231 --> 02:05:48.872]  That's what the Fed funds rate is right now.
[02:05:49.312 --> 02:05:51.794]  So it's an average of something like 0.2 percent.
[02:05:52.314 --> 02:06:00.459]  So if you're a bank, just for starters, the state could start funding its projects at a very low interest rate.
[02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:09.065]  And we've seen that, well, recently there was a lawsuit for these big banks that were colluding to set prices.
[02:06:09.225 --> 02:06:13.288]  So the states are paying much more than they should be.
[02:06:14.352 --> 02:06:15.793]  We're paying for interest.
[02:06:15.873 --> 02:06:18.473]  Plus, we're subject to the rating agencies.
[02:06:18.493 --> 02:06:24.436]  You know, California, where I live, has a rating that's just hovering above Greece's.
[02:06:25.356 --> 02:06:30.458]  And we, in California, the state has never defaulted on its debt.
[02:06:30.598 --> 02:06:39.521]  And there are the Wall Street banks, which would be bankrupt totally if we, the people, including largely California, hadn't bailed them out.
[02:06:40.256 --> 02:06:45.537]  They are paying this incredibly low interest rate and we're paying a high rate because of our bad credit rating.
[02:06:46.258 --> 02:06:49.598]  So, we could play their game.
[02:06:49.658 --> 02:06:55.660]  In other words, we can step into their shoes and get all the perks that a bank gets by being a bank.
[02:06:57.801 --> 02:06:58.381]  Continue.
[02:07:00.261 --> 02:07:04.822]  Well, I had started to explain about how banks create money.
[02:07:06.343 --> 02:07:06.863]  When a bank
[02:07:08.455 --> 02:07:13.519]  First, it creates money on its books, and then the check goes out of the bank, and then it has to clear it.
[02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:23.307]  And if the bank doesn't have the deposit to make it clear, then it just borrows that money back from the other banks, and it borrows at 0.2% interest.
[02:07:23.767 --> 02:07:29.652]  So, essentially what it does is it creates money, the money goes out, and it borrows that very same money back.
[02:07:29.692 --> 02:07:34.476]  In other words, the pool has enough money out there because it just created it and put it out into the pool.
[02:07:35.017 --> 02:07:39.860]  It borrows that same money back at 0.2% interest if that fund's right.
[02:07:39.881 --> 02:07:47.406]  Or, you know, 1 point something if they're taking longer CDs or whatever, but still it's a very low interest rate.
[02:07:47.946 --> 02:07:55.492]  And then they re-lend that to the state at, like, California, 4.7% or to individuals at 6% or something.
[02:07:56.292 --> 02:07:59.535]  Or on credit cards up to 30% or whatever it is.
[02:07:59.635 --> 02:08:01.476]  So they're getting this huge spread.
[02:08:02.316 --> 02:08:07.360]  And if you own the bank, then that spread becomes taxpayer money.
[02:08:07.420 --> 02:08:10.222]  I mean, it goes back into the pool and feeds the pool.
[02:08:11.083 --> 02:08:14.025]  You had mentioned about the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
[02:08:14.706 --> 02:08:25.374]  I was asked to speak at a government finance officer's convention about a month ago in Missouri, so I had a chance to talk to all these finance officers.
[02:08:25.594 --> 02:08:29.257]  And they said, indeed, that they had these huge rainy day pools
[02:08:29.827 --> 02:08:36.851]  There were anywhere from 20% to 75% of their budget that they had to sock away in this rainy day fund.
[02:08:36.891 --> 02:08:47.778]  And the reason was that unlike banks, which have this infinite credit line and can borrow anytime they want, states, they can't borrow.
[02:08:48.019 --> 02:08:51.721]  You know, they have to go to the voters and do a bond issue.
[02:08:51.801 --> 02:08:56.004]  It's a big laborious process and it's never certain whether it's even going to happen.
[02:08:56.024 --> 02:08:58.205]  They don't know if they're going to be able to auction off their bonds.
[02:08:58.905 --> 02:09:09.510]  So it's actually happened in Missouri there, where a city would just come to a standstill, like there would be no money for anything, and the city would stop because they didn't plan their budgets correctly.
[02:09:09.690 --> 02:09:13.472]  So just to make sure, they sock away all this money in rainy day funds.
[02:09:14.272 --> 02:09:15.173]  Well, you can't.
[02:09:15.873 --> 02:09:16.293]  You can't.
[02:09:16.313 --> 02:09:24.877]  Like in California, I know that Treasurer manages $70 billion in a Treasurer's pool of this sort of rainy day fund.
[02:09:26.536 --> 02:09:27.276]  We're good to go.
[02:09:48.194 --> 02:10:04.976]  Well, to interrupt, it's basically all rigged to the big mega-banks, and now they've taken over society, and NAFTA and GATT has destroyed our industrial base, and now to cover this breaking news, and we'll continue with you in a moment, ma'am, world stocks tumble as debt woes rumble on.
[02:10:05.797 --> 02:10:09.160]  And the more trillions the bankers get, the worse things get, the less they loan.
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:10.301]  This is their system.
[02:10:10.801 --> 02:10:21.631]  World markets fell sharply once again Thursday as sentiment continued to be hit by concerns about the continent's debt crisis and figures showed an unexpected increase in U.S.
[02:10:21.691 --> 02:10:23.372]  jobless claims last week.
[02:10:23.773 --> 02:10:29.077]  The worries left most of the world's leading indexes now trading below where they were in 2010.
[02:10:31.041 --> 02:10:39.764]  At the start of 2010, in Europe, the FTSE 100 Index of leading British shares closed down 84.95 points, or 1.7%, at 5,073.13, while Germany's DAX slid to 120.79 points, or 2% to 5,867.88.
[02:10:39.804 --> 02:10:41.765]  The CSC40 in France ended 79.15 points, or 2.3% lower.
[02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.971]  I don't know.
[02:11:17.945 --> 02:11:18.145]  Or, 2.3% to 1,089.99.
[02:11:18.726 --> 02:11:31.014]  The Euro debt crisis continued to be the main point of interest and the markets and fears are growing that it may prove to be the catalyst to a renewed downturn in global growth.
[02:11:31.054 --> 02:11:32.014]  There has been no growth.
[02:11:32.515 --> 02:11:34.656]  If not an outright slide back into recession.
[02:11:34.916 --> 02:11:36.417]  We've never been out of the recession, folks.
[02:11:36.437 --> 02:11:38.218]  Three quarters of recession is depression.
[02:11:38.779 --> 02:11:43.662]  While stocks tank, oil prices slid below $70 a barrel, the 10-year U.S.
[02:11:43.682 --> 02:11:45.443]  Treasury yields dropped to a 2010 low.
[02:11:47.404 --> 02:11:53.830]  Sentiment is awful and confidence has been trashed, said David Buick, markets analyst at BGC Partners.
[02:11:53.850 --> 02:11:59.976]  I mean, the issue here is, folks, it's only going to get worse, like we told you two years ago in the last stage crisis.
[02:12:00.616 --> 02:12:00.896]  Okay?
[02:12:00.937 --> 02:12:04.099]  The stimulus money is only spent on sweetheart insiders.
[02:12:04.139 --> 02:12:06.341]  This is a criminal consolidation.
[02:12:06.382 --> 02:12:08.704]  We have the internal emails of Goldman Sachs.
[02:12:09.938 --> 02:12:17.067]  Either they are brought to justice and kicked out of our country, along with Calderon saying this is Mexico and he wants our guns.
[02:12:17.507 --> 02:12:22.674]  Either we wake up and get angry, which is starting to happen, or we become debt slaves.
[02:12:22.714 --> 02:12:23.375]  And they'll do it.
[02:12:23.435 --> 02:12:24.556]  They're experts at it.
[02:12:24.576 --> 02:12:26.639]  They know how to bring you down into financial slavery.
[02:12:27.139 --> 02:12:29.161]  They know how to put a police state in to suppress you.
[02:12:29.401 --> 02:12:30.602]  They've done it hundreds of times.
[02:12:30.662 --> 02:12:37.349]  This is hard core information and everything is unfolding according to their program.
[02:12:37.429 --> 02:12:42.774]  But the awakening is bigger than they thought it would be and Brzezinski and others are starting to panic.
[02:12:46.258 --> 02:12:56.024]  Knowing how this system works, Ellen Brown, and it's one thing to know it's coming, it's another thing to now see it here, and to know where we're going from this point, straight down.
[02:12:56.825 --> 02:13:05.831]  Being a lawyer, researcher, author on the Federal Reserve, do you ever have a sense of unrealness yourself, because I know I feel like that, that it's just so incredible
[02:13:06.471 --> 02:13:20.036]  The earth-shaking events that are happening right now, and the public's somewhat awake, but if they had any idea just how horrific this is, I think they'd be even more awake and more angry, because I've talked to so many yuppies who say, I'm glad the Euro's plunging, that'll help us.
[02:13:20.416 --> 02:13:21.576]  No, we're going down too.
[02:13:21.856 --> 02:13:24.017]  We're all under the same global system.
[02:13:24.697 --> 02:13:27.458]  And people just live in denial about this.
[02:13:27.478 --> 02:13:33.980]  I don't think people understand, this is the beginning of the implosion, as bad as it is.
[02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:35.801]  We ain't seen nothing yet, as they say.
[02:13:37.312 --> 02:13:44.457]  The book, Web of Debt, the theme of it is the Wizard of Oz, and that's the whole idea that nothing is what we think.
[02:13:44.557 --> 02:13:53.504]  Actually, the Wizard of Oz was written as a monetary allegory in the 1890s, when they had a big populist movement for money reform, which is what I think we need to do today.
[02:13:53.544 --> 02:13:59.589]  They almost won, and now we've seen a hundred years later that the bankers have messed everything up.
[02:13:59.849 --> 02:14:04.092]  It is time for us to step in and take back our government by
[02:14:05.259 --> 02:14:11.742]  Taking back the money power, we have lost the power to issue our own money and our own credit, and that's where we lost our government.
[02:14:14.883 --> 02:14:20.326]  In the case of the Euro, all those countries, they're all in debt.
[02:14:20.586 --> 02:14:22.767]  Now how is that possible if they're all in debt?
[02:14:22.827 --> 02:14:27.109]  It's because they're in debt to bankers, which create their money and lend it to them.
[02:14:27.877 --> 02:14:36.379]  And it's designed, the bankers brag, as a black hole to consolidate the small banks, to bankrupt the states, the nations.
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:40.001]  It is designed to give them total power.
[02:14:41.061 --> 02:14:48.683]  That's right, and at the head is the Bank for International Settlements, which is now tightening the screws even more by talking about
[02:14:49.464 --> 02:14:55.506]  Well, the way the bankers in general have kept a tight rein on economies is by contracting the money supply.
[02:14:55.526 --> 02:14:59.088]  So they never allow enough money to be out there to run the whole economy.
[02:15:19.497 --> 02:15:21.157]  And therefore, people have to borrow.
[02:15:21.318 --> 02:15:29.400]  And that starts this whole pyramid or Ponzi scheme where you have to have more and more borrowers to support the money supply.
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:45.824]  So, you could say that the Bank for International Settlements is responsible for all this, but this whole collapse, this whole recent collapse, in 1988, they imposed Basel I, their first capital requirement.
[02:15:46.224 --> 02:15:48.785]  And at that time, the Japanese banks were the biggest
[02:15:49.335 --> 02:15:49.755]  We're good to go.
[02:16:15.819 --> 02:16:17.400]  They could keep them alive.
[02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:19.522]  So, Japan has never recovered from that.
[02:16:19.982 --> 02:16:20.983]  But we avoided it.
[02:16:21.163 --> 02:16:31.752]  Our Wall Street banks avoided it by getting into this whole securitization thing where the banks would bundle up loans and sell them off to investors.
[02:16:31.832 --> 02:16:32.892]  Well, they didn't just survive.
[02:16:32.932 --> 02:16:33.753]  They got more power.
[02:16:33.793 --> 02:16:36.395]  That was their next phase to economically destroy the West.
[02:16:36.996 --> 02:16:37.236]  Right.
[02:16:37.296 --> 02:16:44.582]  Well, then when they no longer were even going to have the loans on their books, they didn't care what was in these loans because it wasn't going to be their problem.
[02:16:46.558 --> 02:16:58.482]  And then they sold those as AAA-rated, certifying pure garbage.
[02:16:58.742 --> 02:17:00.102]  This has been an amazing interview.
[02:17:00.142 --> 02:17:02.663]  I look forward to having you back on in the future.
[02:17:03.103 --> 02:17:03.644]  Ellen Brown.
[02:17:03.664 --> 02:17:08.305]  People can find out more at EllenBrown.com or they can go to WebOfDebt.com.
[02:17:08.325 --> 02:17:12.586]  Of course, our websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:17:13.146 --> 02:17:14.347]  But in the last 30 seconds,
[02:17:16.010 --> 02:17:18.593]  How long do you think it'll be until they fully implode the U.S.
[02:17:18.633 --> 02:17:19.073]  publicly?
[02:17:21.015 --> 02:17:27.461]  Well, I'm hoping that we can, what we need to do is set up our own independent credit system and then we can avoid that.
[02:17:28.002 --> 02:17:37.471]  If we set up our own, a better mousetrap, then we can let all those, the big banks and the derivatives team, etc., collapse and we will have our own funding mechanism.
[02:17:38.399 --> 02:17:38.779]  You know what?
[02:17:38.819 --> 02:17:40.300]  Do a minute or two on the other side with us.
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:45.762]  I want to ask you that question about, are other states looking at the Bank of North Dakota model?
[02:17:48.623 --> 02:17:49.964]  Don't answer it!

[02:18:06.411 --> 02:18:10.492]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[02:18:45.804 --> 02:18:49.846]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:18:49.926 --> 02:18:52.108]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:18:52.128 --> 02:18:55.050]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:18:55.450 --> 02:19:00.213]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:19:00.533 --> 02:19:04.758]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:19:05.058 --> 02:19:07.401]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:19:07.421 --> 02:19:09.944]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:19:09.964 --> 02:19:12.867]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:19:13.207 --> 02:19:20.816]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:19:21.136 --> 02:19:26.398]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:19:26.538 --> 02:19:29.318]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:19:29.378 --> 02:19:32.819]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:19:33.059 --> 02:19:33.980]  And I got news for you.
[02:19:34.140 --> 02:19:35.440]  You're everyone else.
[02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:36.480]  Invisible Empire.

[02:19:46.795 --> 02:19:49.817]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:19:50.158 --> 02:19:53.781]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:19:54.061 --> 02:19:57.524]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:19:57.784 --> 02:20:05.350]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants.
[02:20:05.350 --> 02:20:05.570]  I think so.
[02:20:20.401 --> 02:20:20.881]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:20:50.430 --> 02:20:56.474]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:20:57.075 --> 02:21:00.097]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:02.358 --> 02:21:09.884]  They went after Ron Paul in 2007, 2008, saying he was a racist with no evidence, just made up.
[02:21:10.244 --> 02:21:14.327]  And now they say if you're against government health care, you're a racist, or you want sovereignty, you're a racist.
[02:21:15.444 --> 02:21:18.686]  And it's not going to work with Rand Paul, but the neocons are attacking him.
[02:21:19.186 --> 02:21:20.687]  Rachel Maddow is attacking him.
[02:21:21.008 --> 02:21:25.310]  We've got a key article up at PrisonPlanet.com by Steve Watson.
[02:21:25.671 --> 02:21:30.434]  Desperate establishment launches baseless racist attack on Rand Paul.
[02:21:33.264 --> 02:21:40.553]  But going back to a final comment from Ellen Brown, lawyer, author, and researcher on the banking system worldwide.
[02:21:41.174 --> 02:21:43.917]  Just real fast, the show's almost over and we appreciate your time.
[02:21:44.818 --> 02:21:46.560]  Are other states now starting to look at this?
[02:21:46.580 --> 02:21:47.661]  Because I'm hearing a lot of
[02:21:48.422 --> 02:21:50.384]  Talk about the State Bank of North Dakota.
[02:21:50.404 --> 02:21:54.927]  I'm hearing a lot of talk about trying to get legislation for the states to save themselves.
[02:21:55.368 --> 02:22:00.212]  We know the states have a big appetite for Tenth Amendment, Ninth Amendment powers right now, and there's a big awakening.
[02:22:01.032 --> 02:22:04.835]  Are we seeing any movement towards other states setting up their own banking system?
[02:22:05.656 --> 02:22:09.199]  Yes, there are actually five states that have bills pending.
[02:22:09.839 --> 02:22:15.864]  Three of them with full-blown bills, you know, that talk about where they're going to get the capital deposits.
[02:22:15.924 --> 02:22:16.845]  That would be Michigan,
[02:22:17.413 --> 02:22:30.402]  Illinois and Washington State, and then two other states that are proposing to study such a bill, and then the three other states besides that, where they've discussed it in the legislature and they're talking about doing bills.
[02:22:31.002 --> 02:22:34.484]  And there are eight candidates from all different persuasions.
[02:22:34.564 --> 02:22:43.490]  I think there's three Democrats, two Republicans, two Greens, and one Independent, that are all including it in their platforms.
[02:22:43.817 --> 02:22:47.439]  So this is really starting to gain esteem thanks to your work and others out there.
[02:22:47.880 --> 02:22:50.481]  Let me guess, the Federal Reserve lobbyists are against this?
[02:22:52.182 --> 02:22:55.945]  I really haven't heard anyone be against it.
[02:22:56.145 --> 02:22:59.367]  I did see one objection in the Detroit News.
[02:22:59.427 --> 02:23:05.050]  Somebody said that Detroit didn't have $150 million, which is what they were proposing for their capital base.
[02:23:05.451 --> 02:23:12.295]  But that's what I started to say about that CAFRA money, the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the Rainy Day Fund.
[02:23:12.782 --> 02:23:16.485]  You could tap up that money as your capital base, even though you can't spend it.
[02:23:16.846 --> 02:23:17.687]  You can invest it.
[02:23:17.807 --> 02:23:21.810]  So you could invest that money as capital in a bank or pension funds.
[02:23:21.850 --> 02:23:26.355]  You know, they invest in equity, stock equity, so they could do it.
[02:23:28.136 --> 02:23:38.526]  You know, Joseph Stiglitz said that $700 billion that was put up for bailing out the bank, what they should have done was use that $700 billion as the capital for a bank.
[02:23:39.102 --> 02:23:41.506]  And they would have seven trillion in credit.
[02:23:41.646 --> 02:23:46.154]  Yeah, but that gives people control of their own lives and makes government sovereign, and we don't want that.
[02:23:46.174 --> 02:23:50.300]  And of course, he's a two-time Nobel Prize winner, one of the prizes for economics.
[02:23:50.741 --> 02:23:52.023]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:23:52.564 --> 02:23:53.285]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:23:53.905 --> 02:23:54.305]  You bet.
[02:23:54.765 --> 02:24:00.367]  Yeah, we're slaves of the bankers, and there's a global rebellion, an awakening happening against these people.
[02:24:01.067 --> 02:24:05.868]  And they'll distract you with a Republican-Democrat, black versus white, all this other stuff.
[02:24:05.888 --> 02:24:12.150]  They'll make movies like Machete to glorify race war, to try to get us fighting with each other, and paint it as liberal.
[02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:15.082]  It's nothing but divide and conquer.
[02:24:15.222 --> 02:24:21.647]  And clearly, the people are now beginning to understand that we better defeat the New World Order or none of us have any future.
[02:24:21.947 --> 02:24:24.209]  These people are ruthless and they're not going to back off.
[02:24:24.729 --> 02:24:26.150]  And stock markets are plunging.
[02:24:26.170 --> 02:24:30.473]  The global financial crisis right now is even worse than what was happening two years ago.
[02:24:30.974 --> 02:24:32.575]  It's a continuation of the same thing.
[02:24:32.875 --> 02:24:34.497]  I want to say great job to the crew today.
[02:24:35.237 --> 02:24:36.378]  We'll be back tomorrow live, 11 a.m.
[02:24:38.777 --> 02:24:39.297]  To 3 p.m.

[02:25:22.217 --> 02:25:23.058]  Spectre falling.
[02:25:23.398 --> 02:25:23.898]  Thank God.
[02:25:23.958 --> 02:25:25.038]  We should all be rejoicing.
