[00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:08.517]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.158 --> 00:00:09.978]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:11.659]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.002]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:20.564]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.902]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, Monday, the 30th day of August, 2010.
[00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:43.447]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us coming up in the last hour to talk about a host of issues.
[00:00:44.168 --> 00:00:46.709]  In fact, here's just some of the reports we've got up there.
[00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.473]  Government think tank calls for infiltrating conspiracy theory websites.
[00:00:52.593 --> 00:00:53.894]  Now, this is the British government
[00:00:54.494 --> 00:01:03.283]  It's already going on, but this is in the London Independent today, how they're infiltrating to make anybody that criticizes the government look ridiculous.
[00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:10.270]  And also to quote, promote trust in the government, because trust in government is imploding.
[00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:13.073]  That's what these leaked government documents out of England show.
[00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:30.601]  And of course, it's the mirror image of Cass Sunstein and the White House here doing the same thing as well, saying they want to work towards shutting down the free web, but in the time being, they need to get in there and get us all infighting with each other, but also trusting the system.
[00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:32.724]  So we'll be reporting on that.
[00:01:33.445 --> 00:01:36.930]  Also, another report up on PrisonPlanet.com from Public Intelligence.
[00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:38.934]  Curt Nemo is doing his own report on this.
[00:01:39.314 --> 00:01:44.462]  DOJ demonizes constitutionalists as extremist criminals.
[00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:56.188]  And remember, a year and a half ago, we were sent by law enforcement to Homeland Security, and MIAC reports saying gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, returning veterans are what Homeland Security is really for.
[00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.572]  This is a public document expanding that demonization.
[00:02:01.612 --> 00:02:07.616]  If you're against the cancer of big corrupt government run by the globalists, you are a criminal.
[00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:09.217]  You are an extremist.
[00:02:09.717 --> 00:02:10.998]  You must be dealt with.
[00:02:11.018 --> 00:02:15.121]  I mean, if you don't want to just hand over control of your life to this system,
[00:02:16.142 --> 00:02:16.782]  You're the enemy.
[00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:25.128]  Meanwhile, the global engineers are also not just controlling the false left, they're controlling the false right.
[00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:44.002]  And they're building up these conservative icons that as soon as Republicans get into power in the next two election cycles, this year and then two years after that, you're going to see expansions of torture, expansions of secret arresting, expansions of the entire control grid.
[00:02:44.522 --> 00:02:50.008]  Just as Obama claimed he was going to end all that, and as soon as he got in it raced forward.
[00:02:50.548 --> 00:03:01.419]  Because as soon as they get fresh birdcage liner in there, the people are so distracted by the pretty new birdcage liner, they're not looking at the globalist bird in the perch, soiling it.
[00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:06.880]  And so we get sick of George W., they give us Barack Obama, new birdcage liner.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.422]  Now we're getting sick of him.
[00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:21.015]  Man, Sarah Palin or Mitt Romney or General Petraeus or top globalist promoting carbon taxes, Newt Gingrich, he is going to look really great.
[00:03:21.676 --> 00:03:27.380]  And they insert him in, and then the whole Glenn Beckian situation will be discredited.
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.681]  But they won't care.
[00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:35.486]  They'll just sit back and wait for the liberals to come back in, and the cycle goes on over and over and over again.
[00:03:35.506 --> 00:03:40.310]  So we've got to have a discussion here about how do we end this cycle.
[00:03:41.297 --> 00:03:44.479]  We're going to be discussing that today as well.
[00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.820]  In the health section, it's incredible news.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.904]  Climate and energy, the economy, police state, Israel, Iran, Middle East, war on terror.
[00:03:54.944 --> 00:03:57.085]  I've got all these stacks over here we will be covering.
[00:03:58.145 --> 00:04:00.307]  We've got, of course, what Glenn Beck's been up to.
[00:04:01.687 --> 00:04:02.868]  Obviously, I'm going to speak about it.
[00:04:04.497 --> 00:04:11.401]  This weekend, every time I turned to talk radio, or read the newspaper, or turned on television briefly, that's all I heard about was Glenn Beck.
[00:04:12.162 --> 00:04:17.285]  They are really building him up as our messianic leader across the political spectrum.
[00:04:17.305 --> 00:04:25.610]  That's how they hope to control this huge grassroots awakening that Ron Paul, myself, you the listeners and viewers, really spurred.
[00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:33.655]  And they are really pulling all the stops to fully co-opt it with the Roger Ailes slash Fox News Corps.
[00:04:34.295 --> 00:04:34.655]  I don't know.
[00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:01.958]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:05:02.338 --> 00:05:05.862]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:05:06.122 --> 00:05:08.785]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:05:09.005 --> 00:05:14.030]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.872]  They're the best company out there.
[00:05:16.112 --> 00:05:20.013]  The longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[00:05:20.313 --> 00:05:22.354]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis.
[00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:25.675]  Not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[00:05:25.995 --> 00:05:27.816]  Try their new evacuation pack.
[00:05:27.976 --> 00:05:30.276]  A two week supply of delicious, easy to fix food.
[00:05:30.536 --> 00:05:32.677]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it.
[00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:38.639]  With open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:40.860]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.280]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.

[00:05:59.605 --> 00:06:04.989]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:11.013]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:11.393 --> 00:06:18.437]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:22.420]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:26.143]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:32.481]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:36.322]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[00:06:37.042 --> 00:06:37.823]  Others don't.
[00:06:38.283 --> 00:06:40.164]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:06:40.424 --> 00:06:41.924]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:06:42.205 --> 00:06:44.766]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:06:45.086 --> 00:06:51.328]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:53.929]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:56.450]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:57.651]  Others don't.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.023]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:03.343 --> 00:07:03.624]  Number 1.
[00:07:04.264 --> 00:07:07.426]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:07.687 --> 00:07:08.247]  Number 2.
[00:07:08.547 --> 00:07:13.091]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:13.891]  It's true.
[00:07:14.171 --> 00:07:18.735]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:19.595]  Number 3.
[00:07:19.876 --> 00:07:23.158]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:23.458 --> 00:07:27.161]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:27.361 --> 00:07:27.902]  Number 4.
[00:07:28.162 --> 00:07:30.525]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:30.925 --> 00:07:34.309]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:34.609 --> 00:07:35.150]  Number 5.
[00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.314]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:39.555 --> 00:07:44.300]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.604]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:48.764 --> 00:07:50.325]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:50.546 --> 00:07:52.628]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:52.788 --> 00:07:55.150]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:08:07.808 --> 00:08:09.249]  We are on the march.
[00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.052]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:08:12.793 --> 00:08:16.536]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.141]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:25.765]  It is Monday, the 30th day of August 2010.
[00:08:25.945 --> 00:08:32.111]  And I'm going to go ahead and plunge straight into the news.
[00:08:36.527 --> 00:08:46.353]  Dealing with the economy, with healthcare, with the deteriorating border and globalism, and so many other important issues.
[00:08:46.413 --> 00:08:51.517]  In fact, here's just one of the stacks of news that I have here in front of me.
[00:08:52.077 --> 00:08:54.919]  This is out of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:04.125]  Five days after there were reports all over South Texas of systemic election fraud in Harris County,
[00:09:05.456 --> 00:09:18.822]  And calls to investigate the electronic voting machines, the voting records, the warehouse containing them went up into complete flames, completely destroyed, everything collapsed, and of course the fire alarms did not work.
[00:09:19.402 --> 00:09:22.324]  Officials scramble after fire destroys voting machines.
[00:09:22.804 --> 00:09:26.926]  Harris County Clerk is urging public to cast ballots early.
[00:09:28.206 --> 00:09:33.491]  And this just happened a few days after the headlines ran, voter fraud in Harris County.
[00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:40.817]  Harris County officials are bringing allegations of major voter registration fraud against a Houston nonprofit.
[00:09:41.838 --> 00:09:48.403]  But it doesn't matter because all of it has now been conveniently destroyed.
[00:09:52.167 --> 00:09:54.589]  You know, you see this all over the country.
[00:09:56.038 --> 00:10:00.840]  The only establishment types that have been winning are in states where there's clearly been fraud.
[00:10:01.281 --> 00:10:03.522]  There's a long history of election fraud in Arizona.
[00:10:04.982 --> 00:10:14.207]  It came out that Pat Buchanan won in many counties during one of his presidential runs in Arizona, but he was shown to almost getting just a few percentage points.
[00:10:14.227 --> 00:10:15.847]  And it's the same thing.
[00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:16.248]  J.D.
[00:10:16.308 --> 00:10:24.972]  Hayworth in every major poll was neck and neck or had been a few points ahead of John McCain.
[00:10:26.178 --> 00:10:28.659]  But he lost by double digits.
[00:10:30.239 --> 00:10:31.440]  Lost by double digits.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.061]  And we've seen this.
[00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:38.982]  I personally caught election fraud in 1998 and 2000.
[00:10:39.483 --> 00:10:55.368]  I went before the Election Commission at the state and county level, and they admitted that we had found the quote, giant errors, but that it was all a big mistake by the county election officials.
[00:10:57.469 --> 00:11:13.840]  And you'd have different members of the county commissioners, like Karen Sunlightner and others, who'd be losing by many points, and then suddenly she collapsed crying, and her good friend, Dana DeDuBois, the head election official, came and hugged her and comforted her in the bathroom.
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.823]  They're good friends, and magically she won there at the end of the evening.
[00:11:19.704 --> 00:11:20.925]  You know, just things like that.
[00:11:22.092 --> 00:11:23.294]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:11:23.334 --> 00:11:32.347]  I mean, I've learned that you go to bed at 2 in the morning watching a local election and the Patriot candidates 10 points ahead and you wake up and they lose by 20.
[00:11:32.387 --> 00:11:34.610]  Yeah, it's just how America works.
[00:11:35.697 --> 00:11:50.928]  I mean, hell, if the government's going to put sodium fluoride in your water, and going to take your pension funds, and use depleted uranium all over the planet, knowing it's going to give you cancer, and they've committed so many other crimes, they're going to shoot your kids up full of mercury-filled vaccines that brain damage them.
[00:11:50.948 --> 00:12:00.574]  If they're going to take your baby's blood secretly at birth, in a secret world government program in the last 38 years, now declassified, why not?
[00:12:02.416 --> 00:12:04.117]  I mean, the sky is the limit here.
[00:12:05.754 --> 00:12:16.577]  So we'll be covering more of that today and I just want to make a small side note on this and then I'm going to get into the major bulk of the news today.
[00:12:22.478 --> 00:12:26.880]  About three weeks ago I happened to tune into Rush Limbaugh and we read the transcript here on air.
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:31.761]  I went to his website and got it and he said basically
[00:12:33.393 --> 00:12:40.977]  That there is a blue-blood group that runs America, and they want to destroy the free market, and they want to destroy the family, and they want to destroy the middle class.
[00:12:40.997 --> 00:12:42.777]  Of course, that's all stated in government textbooks.
[00:12:44.418 --> 00:12:45.759]  Limbaugh didn't just discover this.
[00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:46.839]  He's known this for a long time.
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.901]  And that the Republicans and Democrats are controlled by them.
[00:12:52.422 --> 00:12:54.523]  Well, then this weekend, I happened to tune in.
[00:12:55.947 --> 00:13:00.570]  to one of his broadcasts from the week that was re-airing, and he was talking about the Kook detector.
[00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:10.416]  If Trilateralist is going west at one speed and the Council on Foreign Relations is going east at another speed, how long does it take them to conquer the world?
[00:13:11.737 --> 00:13:15.920]  He was making jokes about Fidel Castro coming out and talking about the Bilderberg Group.
[00:13:17.335 --> 00:13:19.656]  And that shows you how important the Bilderberg Group is.
[00:13:20.096 --> 00:13:22.437]  That Glenn Beck makes jokes about the Bilderberg Group.
[00:13:22.918 --> 00:13:23.838]  Limbaugh does it.
[00:13:23.878 --> 00:13:30.181]  This is a group openly bragging that they helped establish the framework for world government.
[00:13:31.261 --> 00:13:37.184]  Etienne d'Avignon, the Viscount, the head of it, has given BBC interviews.
[00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:41.866]  He's given major interviews to newspapers in Europe.
[00:13:42.326 --> 00:13:42.947]  We've covered it.
[00:13:44.587 --> 00:13:46.008]  It's in several of my latest films.
[00:13:48.516 --> 00:13:51.438]  And then their response is just to laugh it off.
[00:13:51.478 --> 00:13:59.362]  Look, it's not funny that the IMF has officially come out with its new global currency that will be financed off of U.S.
[00:13:59.442 --> 00:14:04.284]  taxpayer funds through carbon taxes that regulate and control every facet of our life.
[00:14:04.765 --> 00:14:07.106]  That's been public now for the last year.
[00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:14.275]  They've even given it a name, the Bancor, Global Digital Currency.
[00:14:14.635 --> 00:14:20.000]  You'll still have your national currency, it'll just be set and denominated by this global unelected group.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:27.306]  I mean, that's at the Davos Switzerland meetings, that's in the British Parliamentary meetings, that's in the Financial Times, it's everywhere.
[00:14:27.686 --> 00:14:32.670]  And I've got to hear this guy sit up there and make jokes about it.
[00:14:35.612 --> 00:14:40.837]  I told you, Ron Paul told you, countless others told you that we're going into a depression.
[00:14:41.438 --> 00:14:42.920]  That it's an engineered depression.
[00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:49.847]  That they're going to use the homeland security grid against conservatives and libertarians and gun owners and landowners.
[00:14:51.101 --> 00:14:52.883]  Now, I knew this more than a decade ago.
[00:14:53.304 --> 00:14:55.306]  Bill Clinton actually set up Homeland Security.
[00:14:55.967 --> 00:14:57.810]  The first references to it are in 1993.
[00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.053]  The threat fusion centers.
[00:15:00.673 --> 00:15:03.777]  All of this is designed for true Americans.
[00:15:04.078 --> 00:15:09.305]  People that believe in the Declaration of Independence, believe in the Constitution, believe in the Bill of Rights.
[00:15:11.858 --> 00:15:12.979]  And it's ridiculous.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.402]  It is admitted that a world government has been founded.
[00:15:16.462 --> 00:15:27.452]  It is admitted that it is founded for the express purpose of setting up a world dictatorship as a means to an end to carry out forced eugenics.
[00:15:29.474 --> 00:15:35.079]  And I'm hearing more and more this schizophrenic talk out of Limbaugh and out of Glenn Beck.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.502]  And it's a double game is what it is.
[00:15:40.796 --> 00:15:45.438]  Beck admits there's a world government, but then makes fun of you if you talk about one of the most powerful groups involved.
[00:15:46.598 --> 00:15:50.059]  One of the bonafide organizations that literally tapped Obama to be president.
[00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:51.560]  We were there at the meeting.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.380]  We knew where to be.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.481]  Protesting.
[00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:56.081]  Pointing out Obama was in there.
[00:15:56.421 --> 00:15:57.802]  Years later it came out he was.
[00:16:00.202 --> 00:16:01.543]  We've been right about it all.
[00:16:02.853 --> 00:16:19.377]  And so we woke up the American people, the American people woke up others, and we're now the majority and the system is sending in Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and all these other people to gatekeep and to control the population and to keep us on the reservation.
[00:16:20.917 --> 00:16:32.160]  So that we'll go out and to make sure at the critical time they can attack Ron Paul and make sure he doesn't get elected, make sure it's a Mitt Romney or a Sarah Palin or a Newt Gingrich.
[00:16:34.215 --> 00:16:35.076]  It's just that simple.
[00:16:35.617 --> 00:16:39.681]  And so now, more and more, they will tell you about 90% of the truth.
[00:16:41.423 --> 00:16:55.499]  But then Glenn Beck will get up and say, oh, the MIAC report, the Homeland Security report, well, it talks about dangerous groups, and he'll say, I agree with that, I disagree with this, I agree with that, and kind of, well, this is kind of a good law enforcement report.
[00:16:58.063 --> 00:17:05.185]  But see, I already knew about those reports before one of the latest ones we broke last year got so much attention.
[00:17:07.346 --> 00:17:10.847]  I already had gotten the reports in 96, 97, 98, 99, 2000, 2001.
[00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:23.351]  I'd gotten them from Louisiana and Arizona and Maryland and Texas, over and over again, saying the exact same stuff that was in there.
[00:17:24.431 --> 00:17:25.232]  Predating 9-11.
[00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:38.437]  That's how I knew that the whole focus was for the American people, not guys wearing turbans that live in Central Asia who've been on the CIA bandwagon since their inception.
[00:17:41.719 --> 00:17:47.122]  And so, when I would see Glenn Beck go to the White House in 2008 and 2009,
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:18:03.826]  2007-2008 and admittedly get marching orders from Karl Rove and George W. Bush and support torture and the Patriot Act and secret arrest and say you were a liberal commie if you were against it.
[00:18:04.687 --> 00:18:13.531]  And then I would see him demonize militias and Ron Paul supporters and say they want to bomb buildings and the army needs to be used against them.
[00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:17.033]  I'd already read all the Homeland Security reports.
[00:18:17.533 --> 00:18:19.935]  I knew Glenn Beck was reading a teleprompter
[00:18:20.984 --> 00:18:22.704]  That had that information put on it!
[00:18:22.965 --> 00:18:23.845]  It was a script!
[00:18:24.205 --> 00:18:25.305]  And I was horrified!
[00:18:25.905 --> 00:18:26.986]  And I'm gonna be honest with you.
[00:18:27.326 --> 00:18:29.706]  I get such a bad feeling when I look at Glenn Beck.
[00:18:29.726 --> 00:18:30.627]  He is so evil.
[00:18:31.407 --> 00:18:32.487]  That I become sick.
[00:18:33.227 --> 00:18:34.508]  It's like being in a room with a demon.
[00:18:34.928 --> 00:18:36.428]  So I don't listen, I don't watch.
[00:18:37.128 --> 00:18:38.449]  And I've been wrong.
[00:18:40.449 --> 00:18:40.749]  Okay?
[00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:42.010]  It's hard for me to look at him.
[00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.430]  Just like it's hard for me to look at Barack Obama or Bill Clinton.
[00:18:46.391 --> 00:18:50.312]  I can read transcripts of what they say, but to look at them, it really upsets me, folks.
[00:18:51.650 --> 00:19:05.383]  Because they're so plastic, they're so funny, they enjoy conning you, and I've left Beck alone lately and just said, look, I'm not gonna attack him, I'm not gonna talk about him, but he's doing so much good now, but I know he's Judas Iscariot!
[00:19:05.824 --> 00:19:07.325]  I know he's Benedict Arnold!
[00:19:08.006 --> 00:19:11.329]  I know who he is, in my bones, in my gut!
[00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.972]  But I don't just go off that, I've seen him!
[00:19:14.432 --> 00:19:15.934]  The guy reads off a script!
[00:19:17.864 --> 00:19:21.809]  Word for word, at key points, he's there to sabotage.
[00:19:23.851 --> 00:19:26.774]  And he's there to make the Liberty Movement look bad at the end of the day.
[00:19:27.295 --> 00:19:29.217]  And I'm not just somebody that just judges people.
[00:19:29.297 --> 00:19:30.038]  I've watched him.
[00:19:30.518 --> 00:19:31.219]  I've studied him.
[00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:36.145]  I mean, Russell Limbaugh is so smart.
[00:19:36.565 --> 00:19:38.247]  He knows this world government's real.
[00:19:39.147 --> 00:19:43.753]  He knows it's now for years been all over the news as they push it and try to sell the public on it.
[00:19:44.333 --> 00:19:47.557]  And he still sits there to his audience and lies to them.
[00:19:48.218 --> 00:19:49.339]  And Glenn Beck does it.
[00:19:51.021 --> 00:19:52.003]  And they're mercenaries.
[00:19:52.023 --> 00:19:56.929]  They think it's tough and cool that they're heartless and lying to their listeners and betraying them.
[00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.691]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.546 --> 00:20:05.010]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:13.877]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water filtration systems.

[00:21:02.162 --> 00:21:07.045]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:21:07.926 --> 00:21:18.712]  I started survivalistseeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on prisonplanet.com.
[00:21:19.986 --> 00:21:27.552]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:21:28.252 --> 00:21:31.975]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.
[00:21:32.816 --> 00:21:48.028]  Now I'm offering 50 all-organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planner, and a CD teaching you how to save seeds, so your children's children will always have healthy food.
[00:21:48.991 --> 00:21:50.771]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:21:51.692 --> 00:21:57.513]  I'm Vic John Lipscomb, and my company is SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:22:00.873 --> 00:22:04.714]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:22:04.754 --> 00:22:06.014]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:22:06.155 --> 00:22:09.735]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:22:10.035 --> 00:22:12.536]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:22:12.936 --> 00:22:14.696]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:22:15.016 --> 00:22:17.317]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:22:18.377 --> 00:22:23.985]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:22:24.025 --> 00:22:26.448]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:22:34.059 --> 00:22:35.960]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:22:36.141 --> 00:22:38.602]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:22:38.702 --> 00:22:41.664]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[00:22:41.684 --> 00:22:42.365]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:22:42.405 --> 00:22:45.107]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[00:22:45.127 --> 00:22:45.767]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:23:00.217 --> 00:23:02.578]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[00:23:02.818 --> 00:23:11.483]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.
[00:23:11.643 --> 00:23:23.930]  If you owe $10,000 or more in credit card bills and are struggling to make minimum payments, get ready to take down this number for free information that could potentially save your home, the lifestyle you're accustomed to, and your family's financial well-being.
[00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:24.790]  But don't wait!
[00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.992]  Studies show that if most debt problems are confronted directly,
[00:23:28.152 --> 00:23:28.512]  We're good.
[00:23:45.247 --> 00:23:47.288]  Folks, I don't want to spend all day on Glenn Beck.
[00:23:47.328 --> 00:23:47.888]  It's just that...
[00:24:10.214 --> 00:24:12.795]  I tuned in to NPR.
[00:24:13.815 --> 00:24:18.016]  I tuned in to MSNBC, Fox on XM Radio.
[00:24:18.676 --> 00:24:20.497]  But I'll be going to the store and things this weekend.
[00:24:21.057 --> 00:24:23.558]  I turned the television on for five minutes.
[00:24:25.038 --> 00:24:27.859]  Every show I've listened to, all they've talked about is Glenn Beck.
[00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:31.940]  And again, it's very sophisticated propaganda.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:38.682]  Of course it's reasonable for Glenn Beck to have a rally at the Lincoln Memorial.
[00:24:40.046 --> 00:24:47.410]  And I think it's great that he had the niece of Martin Luther King there, who's a conservative black lady and who's against abortion.
[00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:50.291]  You know, over half the black folks in this country aren't born.
[00:24:50.331 --> 00:24:51.192]  They're killed in the womb.
[00:24:51.212 --> 00:24:57.014]  I mean, that is truly the message that needs to be gotten out.
[00:24:57.455 --> 00:25:03.718]  That the fake liberal establishment wants to carry out eugenics and basically exterminate black people.
[00:25:04.525 --> 00:25:12.456]  And when I spot check Beck, when he's on in the break room or something here at the office, I see a lot I like.
[00:25:12.996 --> 00:25:14.939]  I see a lot that I appreciate.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.822]  But then my instinct...
[00:25:19.005 --> 00:25:21.626]  Tells me, Alex, this guy's bad news.
[00:25:21.666 --> 00:25:27.687]  And then I remember, yeah, he said that, oh, Ron Paul's got something called a money bomb.
[00:25:28.167 --> 00:25:30.308]  That means that they want to blow things up.
[00:25:30.348 --> 00:25:32.048]  We need to use the army against them.
[00:25:32.088 --> 00:25:34.829]  And we've got to worry about these domestic groups.
[00:25:35.009 --> 00:25:38.330]  And he's done so many things like that.
[00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.491]  So many creepy, multi-faced things.
[00:25:41.531 --> 00:25:43.712]  I mean, take his new book, The Overton Window.
[00:25:43.732 --> 00:25:45.292]  That's the number one New York Times bestseller.
[00:25:46.943 --> 00:26:04.265]  And you'd think I'd be flattered that there's this character, Mr. Bailey, who's a patriot YouTube-type star, who discovers that the government's staging terror attacks and sacrifices himself to stop the government nuking L.A.
[00:26:04.585 --> 00:26:05.787]  to bring in martial law.
[00:26:06.991 --> 00:26:07.791]  But it's creepy.
[00:26:08.172 --> 00:26:09.633]  Now, we broke the Mayak Report.
[00:26:10.313 --> 00:26:12.774]  We're exposing government-sponsored terror.
[00:26:13.054 --> 00:26:16.857]  Clearly, I'm the hero of the book, or an archetype of myself.
[00:26:18.037 --> 00:26:22.220]  It's just creepy that Beck says this book is faction.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.362]  It's real things or real things going on put in fiction.
[00:26:27.323 --> 00:26:31.285]  Then you read it, and it's everything he denies.
[00:26:31.345 --> 00:26:31.765]  The U.S.
[00:26:31.785 --> 00:26:34.787]  government staging terror attacks with offshore globalists.
[00:26:35.744 --> 00:26:40.007]  They want to destroy America from within, by design, the big banks are behind it.
[00:26:41.448 --> 00:26:54.616]  Basically, everything that's true, put in fiction, faction, and then, at the end of the book, Beck says, by the way, none of this is true, there's no world government, the government's not staging terror attacks, this is kooky.
[00:26:57.197 --> 00:26:59.939]  Yeah, this book's got FEMA camps in it, but they're not real.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.062]  I mean, why didn't he write a non-fiction book?
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.781]  And then say, you know, this is what's really going on.
[00:27:07.841 --> 00:27:08.101]  Why?
[00:27:08.881 --> 00:27:09.941]  It's so sick.
[00:27:10.741 --> 00:27:11.602]  Everything with him.
[00:27:11.622 --> 00:27:15.403]  I mean, I want to save this country.
[00:27:15.623 --> 00:27:16.643]  I have no future.
[00:27:17.203 --> 00:27:18.143]  You have no future.
[00:27:18.203 --> 00:27:21.504]  Our children have no future if we don't turn things around.
[00:27:21.604 --> 00:27:28.506]  And if Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck would come out all the way and tell it like it is and really expose both parties,
[00:27:29.628 --> 00:27:32.050]  Oh, they claim both parties are bad, but it's lip service.
[00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:33.490]  It's lip service.
[00:27:33.531 --> 00:27:36.072]  They're run by the big Republican establishment.
[00:27:38.774 --> 00:27:44.397]  If you think you're going to get real change from that, I got a bridge I'm wanting to sell you on the moon.
[00:27:46.699 --> 00:27:47.940]  Just like with Obama.
[00:27:49.701 --> 00:27:52.342]  I started making the Obama deception the day he was elected.
[00:27:53.683 --> 00:27:56.125]  And it was released about a month and a half after he was in office.
[00:27:58.379 --> 00:28:02.962]  And that film has been seen more than 30 million times for free online.
[00:28:03.462 --> 00:28:06.765]  And it's really caused a political sea change out there.
[00:28:08.586 --> 00:28:12.689]  And people watch it and they go, how did this guy make this film?
[00:28:12.749 --> 00:28:14.050]  Everything he said came true.
[00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:16.351]  Because I knew who Obama's advisors were.
[00:28:16.371 --> 00:28:19.033]  I knew who his financial supporters were.
[00:28:19.053 --> 00:28:21.875]  And I know how the globalists operate.
[00:28:22.175 --> 00:28:25.938]  And now here I am seeing national polls where voters
[00:28:27.008 --> 00:28:30.789]  The vast majority, almost 70%, trust Republicans.
[00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:33.530]  Almost 2 to 1.
[00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:36.851]  Over Democrats.
[00:28:37.051 --> 00:28:42.012]  Just like they trusted Democrats close to 2 to 1 right before Obama got in.
[00:28:42.332 --> 00:28:45.033]  And I don't want to relive this Groundhog Day again.
[00:28:47.193 --> 00:28:48.594]  I don't want to go through this again.
[00:28:48.674 --> 00:28:49.854]  We don't have time.
[00:28:51.254 --> 00:28:52.195]  We're in deep trouble.
[00:28:52.235 --> 00:28:53.195]  We're in a depression.
[00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:55.830]  That's now being admitted.
[00:28:56.191 --> 00:29:02.733]  The very same banks that orchestrated it got more power through the banker bailout and through the financial overhaul.
[00:29:04.134 --> 00:29:12.917]  And again, I had to watch Glenn Beck say, we've got to support the banker bailout.
[00:29:13.358 --> 00:29:14.458]  It's not big enough.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.261]  Always at the key point, he stabs you in the back.
[00:29:22.674 --> 00:29:33.981]  We don't have time to hate Obama so much that we think we win with a bunch of establishment Republicans, and then three, four years later we figure out they've cheated us and we think we win with the next Obama.
[00:29:34.421 --> 00:29:34.661]  No!
[00:29:35.882 --> 00:29:37.143]  Chuck Baldwin said it best.
[00:29:37.203 --> 00:29:38.824]  We don't need a new movement.
[00:29:39.124 --> 00:29:40.064]  We need a revolution.
[00:29:40.565 --> 00:29:41.605]  A peaceful revolution.
[00:29:42.025 --> 00:29:44.087]  But we need to get really serious.
[00:29:44.387 --> 00:29:49.190]  And if you think Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin are going to lead us out of this, you're blind.
[00:29:49.824 --> 00:29:52.825]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.746 --> 00:29:56.527]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.348 --> 00:30:00.929]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.691]  This information is too important to wait.
[00:32:59.773 --> 00:33:01.974]  You walk into this room at your own risk.
[00:33:02.755 --> 00:33:04.156]  Because it leads to the future.
[00:33:04.917 --> 00:33:07.219]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[00:33:08.359 --> 00:33:09.460]  This is not a new world.
[00:33:10.621 --> 00:33:13.924]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[00:33:15.009 --> 00:33:22.494]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:30.359]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:36.162]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[00:33:37.203 --> 00:33:39.465]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:50.788]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:51.068 --> 00:33:55.629]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:55.649 --> 00:33:56.950]  We're back live.
[00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:03.212]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:34:03.272 --> 00:34:08.974]  We're going to have open phones in the next hour interspersed with news.
[00:34:10.353 --> 00:34:19.815]  And Paul Joseph Watson on some really important subjects is going to be joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[00:34:19.835 --> 00:34:25.876]  You know, here's an issue that I want to hear from Rush Limbaugh and Glenn back on.
[00:34:28.336 --> 00:34:32.437]  Finland suspends flu shots after vaccine linked with neurological disorders.
[00:34:33.597 --> 00:34:37.258]  India halts vaccine program after four deaths of children.
[00:34:37.298 --> 00:34:39.258]  They died instantly after being injected.
[00:34:40.066 --> 00:34:40.686]  Within minutes.
[00:34:43.549 --> 00:34:45.110]  Meanwhile, they're back pushing it again.
[00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:49.273]  England suspends the shot in under five-year-olds with tenfold increase in seizures.
[00:34:50.013 --> 00:34:51.634]  You know, we're right about that again.
[00:34:52.135 --> 00:34:57.959]  We were right about the autoimmune diseases, the brain inflammation, the blood running out of babies' noses.
[00:35:02.482 --> 00:35:07.746]  You know, I have shied away from really going after Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh.
[00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:15.237]  And I've tried to support them and praise them when I've seen good out of them, and I feel dirty every time I do it.
[00:35:16.218 --> 00:35:17.719]  You know why I try to support them?
[00:35:17.779 --> 00:35:20.780]  At a conscious level, I don't like infighters.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.523]  I don't like people that critique other talk show hosts and spend all their time going after people.
[00:35:25.823 --> 00:35:27.904]  If you've noticed, you hardly ever hear that from me.
[00:35:28.504 --> 00:35:29.225]  Very rarely.
[00:35:30.691 --> 00:35:43.580]  But I spent a lot of time this weekend, because Glenn Beck was so much in the news, it focused, it forced me to focus and to really remember why I have such a bad feeling about Glenn Beck.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:53.287]  And I wrote an entire booklet of notes over the weekend.
[00:35:54.888 --> 00:35:56.369]  And I was like, oh my gosh.
[00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:58.551]  I had an epiphany.
[00:35:59.864 --> 00:36:02.725]  I had an epiphany, and I thought about this last year.
[00:36:02.745 --> 00:36:12.268]  I didn't do it, because I guess at a spiritual level, it is painful to investigate Glenn Beck.
[00:36:13.769 --> 00:36:16.069]  He's like a little pig demon, a little piggy monster.
[00:36:20.754 --> 00:36:36.943]  I'd rather, at a conscious level, just rationalize and go, well, he's opening up a lot of doors, he's getting people to admit there's globalism, and that the globalists want to destroy the family, and, you know, he's doing a lot of good, yeah, but he's still promoting wars.
[00:36:38.244 --> 00:36:43.807]  He's not telling you how the big megabanks control the communists, and the progressives, as he calls them.
[00:36:44.548 --> 00:36:46.389]  He's not telling you about the vaccines.
[00:36:48.513 --> 00:36:51.154]  He's not giving people the real answers.
[00:36:51.194 --> 00:36:53.335]  He's not going all the way.
[00:36:54.476 --> 00:37:05.341]  And I'm glad that I thought about Glenn Beck quite a bit, and then happened to tune in and heard Limbaugh, because you don't know how much I want to believe in Limbaugh.
[00:37:06.321 --> 00:37:08.482]  How much I want to believe he's really woken up.
[00:37:08.502 --> 00:37:15.385]  You know, when he's talking about secret elites and bluebloods that want to destroy America, and I get on air and I praise him,
[00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:18.690]  I want to turn the corner.
[00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:19.530]  I want to win.
[00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:21.212]  I want to beat this thing.
[00:37:21.832 --> 00:37:26.555]  Because I realize how monstrous these globalists are.
[00:37:27.396 --> 00:37:28.997]  I realize they're a pack of killers.
[00:37:29.377 --> 00:37:32.299]  They're not just corrupt good old boys that want to dominate society.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.161]  They want to bankrupt things.
[00:37:34.201 --> 00:37:36.182]  They want to break down the borders.
[00:37:36.242 --> 00:37:44.308]  They want to truly re-engineer this society and have massive purges of patriots.
[00:37:44.928 --> 00:37:45.909]  They're training for it.
[00:37:47.304 --> 00:38:01.753]  And I know that when George Bush was in office, Glenn Beck was reading off of ADL Southern Poverty Law Center scripts every single day and attacking Ron Paul.
[00:38:02.773 --> 00:38:05.215]  So I was forced to go after him at the time.
[00:38:11.619 --> 00:38:13.360]  Even though I was told through the grapevine
[00:38:15.252 --> 00:38:17.100]  If you attack Glenn Beck...
[00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:27.673]  We're gonna make sure that you don't get interviewed on these big, clear-channel owned radio shows, or we're gonna make sure it's cut back to nothing.
[00:38:28.993 --> 00:38:34.376]  I was told this, and of course it's off-record so I don't break my journalistic integrity.
[00:38:35.196 --> 00:38:45.941]  And then I was told that Glenn Beck has five people listening to the show every day, writing notes, and when I was told this by two separate high-level Fox News individuals, I'll just leave it at that,
[00:38:46.917 --> 00:38:49.920]  One of them's a household name, the other is an executive.
[00:38:50.981 --> 00:38:59.951]  When I was told this, it kind of creeped me out, and I didn't know what to do about it, and I just kind of backed off Glenn Beck.
[00:39:04.778 --> 00:39:06.980]  Just so I could try to figure out what was going on.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:18.269]  I mean, I was still criticizing him, but I kind of went into a cogitative format of Glenn Beck has five people listening to every word I say, writing notes.
[00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:19.990]  They're sitting in a war room right now.
[00:39:20.771 --> 00:39:33.141]  Glenn Beck is obsessed with me, and tells everyone, don't go on his show, or I won't have you on my show, and has network executives from radio put pressure on other hosts not to have me on.
[00:39:36.016 --> 00:39:43.839]  You know how creepy it is to have three reports last week put out on me saying I'm the number one enemy of the Southern Poverty Law Center?
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:47.481]  You know what it's like to have the ADL say I'm the number one enemy?
[00:39:47.821 --> 00:39:48.181]  You know what?
[00:39:48.321 --> 00:39:48.802]  Number one!
[00:39:48.822 --> 00:39:50.462]  They say I'm the number one evil out there.
[00:39:51.483 --> 00:39:57.705]  Do you know what it's like to have, when cops are killed in Pittsburgh, within two hours to have the media saying it's my fault?
[00:40:00.326 --> 00:40:03.588]  And I got a bunch of news and I want to get into it and talk about it and cover it.
[00:40:08.444 --> 00:40:15.828]  It's just I've got so many thoughts, so many points, because this has to deal with everything I stand for.
[00:40:16.428 --> 00:40:33.176]  I mean, I'm trying to wake people up, and I wake folks up to the New World Order at record levels, going back five, six years ago, when we really started reaching millions a day, not just millions a month or a week.
[00:40:35.839 --> 00:40:47.906]  And to see all of my semantical terms taken and repackaged and used as a weapon angers me.
[00:40:47.986 --> 00:40:56.031]  When I would attack Bush, it would be co-opted and twisted by the controlled left and would end up serving the Democratic Party.
[00:40:57.431 --> 00:41:03.215]  And now everything I do to an even greater level is taken and repackaged and used to attack Obama
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.883]  And I could see the media setting him up for destruction.
[00:41:07.243 --> 00:41:09.005]  I said this would happen in the Obama deception.
[00:41:10.387 --> 00:41:22.320]  Getting ready to put all the blame on him, and then he moves off the stage, and the new puppet comes on, who then is built up as the savior, and then destroyed, and the cycle goes on over and over again.
[00:41:32.622 --> 00:41:46.128]  Put it to you this way, it is not a good feeling to have all of these really powerful organizations obsessed with what I do, tracking everything I do, attacking me from every angle.
[00:41:47.008 --> 00:41:52.630]  A lot of people would get on a power trip and would go crazy with megalomania.
[00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:55.711]  We've seen a lot of people do that, or they go crazy from a stress.
[00:41:56.612 --> 00:41:59.413]  Instead of that, it's really the opposite.
[00:42:03.672 --> 00:42:25.218]  I feel my soul growing, and my understanding growing, and my knowledge growing, and my wisdom growing, but then I also can see what I'm doing on air, and can analyze what I'm saying and doing on air, and critique it to myself, and then I don't even feel worthy to be here.
[00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:47.214]  But then I look at the other people that the system has put up there as counterfeits of patriots, of Ron Paul, of myself, and of the archetype of freedom that all of us represent who are on the side of good, and it's just very frustrating.
[00:42:55.216 --> 00:42:57.557]  It is frustrating to have all this news in front of me.
[00:42:58.416 --> 00:43:19.745]  It's frustrating to have everything we've talked about confirmed in triplicate because we don't see the awakening happening fast enough and we see these clearly transparent bad guys on both sides of the controlled political spectrum like a Don King fight.
[00:43:20.105 --> 00:43:21.446]  We know Don King owns
[00:43:23.882 --> 00:43:47.648]  We're both fighters, we know it's a rigged game, and everything we've talked about has come true, and still we then see people that we woke up to Bush being conned by Obama, and now people we're waking up to Obama are falling under the spell of Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney, and Newt Gingrich.
[00:43:49.148 --> 00:43:50.889]  I guess it's really this at the end of the day.
[00:43:52.808 --> 00:43:55.029]  I don't relish being well-known.
[00:43:55.209 --> 00:44:01.091]  I don't relish everything that comes with it.
[00:44:02.551 --> 00:44:04.372]  I just want to get these people out of my life.
[00:44:04.572 --> 00:44:10.353]  And I realize that things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.
[00:44:12.054 --> 00:44:18.176]  And Glenn Beck is such a sophisticated, multi-faceted, multi-layered psy-op.
[00:44:20.287 --> 00:44:37.218]  That I really at the end of the day realize the reason that I've only sporadically spoken out against him is because I can't just come on air and
[00:44:39.446 --> 00:44:56.188]  Expose a few facets of what Glenn Beck represents, because if I do that, and if I don't do it properly, his PSYOP is designed by the Pentagon and the psych warfare chiefs to where it will only empower him.
[00:45:02.352 --> 00:45:15.238]  And at the same time, the vibe I get off of Beck is a tortured, very unhappy soul who all he has is competitiveness and dominating those around him.
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.901]  And it's painful to look into his soul.
[00:45:23.962 --> 00:45:30.985]  It's painful to turn my intellect on him and really analyze what he is because
[00:45:32.392 --> 00:45:33.192]  It's so horrible.
[00:45:38.154 --> 00:45:42.296]  And I, I, I shirk responsibility at a subconscious level.
[00:45:44.256 --> 00:45:49.919]  I've been working for two years on a eugenics film that covers the total master plan of the globalist.
[00:45:50.839 --> 00:45:57.721]  And I've put it off again with my crew until early next year because I, we've done over 20 interviews around the country.
[00:45:58.442 --> 00:46:01.583]  Just the plane tickets and hotels are 80 plus grand.
[00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:04.728]  And for us, that's a lot of money.
[00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:09.113]  We're way over budget, and I just can't release it.
[00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:11.615]  Because it's not ready.
[00:46:12.716 --> 00:46:13.777]  I learn more every day.
[00:46:13.817 --> 00:46:20.163]  We get more Rockefeller Foundation documents that are public about how they're poisoning the food and water and the vaccines.
[00:46:20.183 --> 00:46:22.145]  I think about all the kids they're hurting.
[00:46:22.185 --> 00:46:24.227]  Every time I look at my children, they're so innocent and good.
[00:46:24.267 --> 00:46:25.829]  I started crying this morning.
[00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:33.631]  Because I think about these murderers and how much fun they have trying to hurt little ones.
[00:46:34.411 --> 00:46:36.151]  I think about all the children I can't protect.
[00:46:38.412 --> 00:46:44.253]  And then I think to myself, if I make a Glenn Beck deception, it's got to be really research.
[00:46:44.293 --> 00:46:46.573]  And I've got all the research, and it's got to be powerful.
[00:46:47.794 --> 00:46:50.214]  It's got to really show people what I know about him.
[00:46:50.914 --> 00:46:56.996]  So that when he betrays them to a greater extent, they will recognize Judas Iscariot.
[00:46:57.356 --> 00:46:58.416]  So that he can then
[00:46:59.673 --> 00:47:03.155]  Be used for good to complete the awakening.
[00:47:04.195 --> 00:47:11.118]  Clinton took us so far, Bush Sr., before that Bush Jr., Obama.
[00:47:12.098 --> 00:47:22.843]  But I believe by doing an expose on the controlled Republican Party and the controlled right wing in this country, that the circle will be complete.
[00:47:24.431 --> 00:47:26.412]  So I'm suspending all other filmmaking.
[00:47:26.752 --> 00:47:32.594]  I'm committing now, you have my promise, that before Christmas I will release the Glenn Beck Deception.
[00:47:34.295 --> 00:47:45.940]  You have my word on this, unless I get killed or have a car wreck or have family issues, unforeseen crises, that I will complete and deliver to you the Glenn Beck Deception.
[00:47:47.133 --> 00:47:51.415]  And so we will have the Obama deception to expose the phone he left, and who finances it?
[00:47:51.875 --> 00:47:56.818]  We will have the Obama deception, and I will show you that they are funded by the exact same interests.
[00:47:57.118 --> 00:47:58.519]  See, that's where I've got Glenn Beck.
[00:47:58.959 --> 00:48:01.420]  I know he's funded by the same people that run Obama.
[00:48:02.561 --> 00:48:06.663]  I know he reads off teleprompters written by the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL.
[00:48:08.064 --> 00:48:09.925]  I know he's in the Pentagon hip pocket.
[00:48:09.945 --> 00:48:10.845]  He's even bragged about it.
[00:48:11.405 --> 00:48:12.506]  I know who he is.
[00:48:13.747 --> 00:48:15.668]  And I know what he's being positioned for.
[00:48:16.663 --> 00:48:17.031]  And so...
[00:48:20.524 --> 00:48:23.545]  I'm going all in against the right-wing establishment.
[00:48:23.866 --> 00:48:34.991]  Just like when they were raising Obama up as the messianic Christ to save Earth and putting him on jewelry and coins and plates and saying he was like Jesus on the news, remember that?
[00:48:35.531 --> 00:48:37.912]  I said, the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[00:48:38.192 --> 00:48:44.275]  He will be built up to ram through the banking takeover, the health care takeover, and to keep the wars going.
[00:48:44.555 --> 00:48:48.417]  Then he will be destroyed to bring in
[00:48:50.765 --> 00:48:53.727]  What will probably be the final right-wing fake coup.
[00:48:54.888 --> 00:48:58.531]  Everything's converging where they may let Obama do it with a staged nuke attack.
[00:48:58.571 --> 00:48:59.372]  Probably not though.
[00:49:03.054 --> 00:49:04.816]  It's going to be the right-wing messianic leader.
[00:49:05.436 --> 00:49:11.261]  And America is going to hate Obama so much by the time he's done with his role.
[00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:16.451]  That Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, and others are going to be godlike.
[00:49:17.011 --> 00:49:19.252]  They are going to take on the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[00:49:19.512 --> 00:49:22.013]  They're going to take on the anti-eugenics mantle.
[00:49:22.213 --> 00:49:23.273]  They're already starting now.
[00:49:23.293 --> 00:49:24.813]  I mean, you see it.
[00:49:24.853 --> 00:49:26.054]  A guest is on here a month later.
[00:49:26.074 --> 00:49:26.734]  They're on their show.
[00:49:26.794 --> 00:49:27.594]  I cover eugenics.
[00:49:27.914 --> 00:49:28.595]  I cover a book.
[00:49:28.615 --> 00:49:29.855]  It's on Beck's show a week later.
[00:49:30.155 --> 00:49:34.576]  But with his spin, that it's, oh, some little low-level progressives that are doing this.
[00:49:35.056 --> 00:49:37.457]  No, this is scientifically funded.
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:42.682]  And so I'm going to expose Glenn Beck.
[00:49:44.523 --> 00:49:52.329]  But through that, I'm going to complete the expose of the left-right paradigm and show people how they're controlled.
[00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:54.730]  And I have to do this.
[00:49:54.830 --> 00:50:05.178]  I mean, I've come to the realization I can't let all my work and all of my blood, sweat and tears and literally pouring my guts, my soul into this.
[00:50:08.146 --> 00:50:16.809]  I can't have them, like the giant, grab me up and say, be he live or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make my bread.
[00:50:17.509 --> 00:50:24.691]  I can't be ground up and put in this loaf of poison bread that Glenn Beck and Fox News are going to sell everybody.
[00:50:26.832 --> 00:50:34.754]  Remember under Bush, the derivatives, the banking scams, the torture, the wars, the Patriot Act, all of it was built for you, the American people.
[00:50:37.353 --> 00:50:40.577]  And now they're going to come to power.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.983]  See, now we've defeated Obama as their vessel.
[00:50:45.263 --> 00:50:55.936]  Now we've got to switch our targeting guns in the Infowar over against the neocons that want to hijack the Tea Party that Ron Paul created.
[00:50:55.956 --> 00:50:56.537]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:00.259 --> 00:51:08.191]  Why almost all politicians, teachers, and preachers are dead wrong about how to keep this country from becoming a total dictatorship.
[00:51:09.032 --> 00:51:12.276]  If that headline got your attention, then you know the only way back.
[00:51:12.457 --> 00:51:15.201]  The only way back to true freedom and liberty in America.
[00:51:15.461 --> 00:51:19.184]  Have you ever wondered about whether your personal and religious liberty will survive?
[00:51:19.365 --> 00:51:24.149]  After all, what good are gold, silver, and survival supplies in a concentration camp?
[00:51:24.329 --> 00:51:28.353]  And have you ever thought about what kind of America you're leaving to your kids and grandkids?
[00:51:28.733 --> 00:51:32.897]  Then theonlywayback.com is an open online letter you must read.
[00:51:33.097 --> 00:51:35.179]  Find out where true liberty comes from.
[00:51:35.179 --> 00:51:35.799]  We're good to go.
[00:52:03.985 --> 00:52:04.906]  Tyranny is here.
[00:52:05.246 --> 00:52:08.949]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:09.169 --> 00:52:11.391]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:11.411 --> 00:52:16.855]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:52:17.275 --> 00:52:23.540]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:29.525]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:29.925 --> 00:52:33.628]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:52:34.088 --> 00:52:38.091]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:52:38.372 --> 00:52:43.916]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:44.336 --> 00:52:47.338]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:47.879 --> 00:52:49.320]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:50.381]  It's here.

[00:52:59.005 --> 00:52:59.465]  Attention!
[00:52:59.585 --> 00:53:04.488]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[00:53:04.588 --> 00:53:10.131]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[00:53:10.271 --> 00:53:17.235]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[00:53:17.416 --> 00:53:23.419]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement.
[00:53:23.539 --> 00:53:26.840]  For you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:30.300]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:37.161]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[00:53:37.362 --> 00:53:46.163]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[00:53:46.303 --> 00:53:50.924]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[00:53:51.084 --> 00:53:51.425]  800-902-6969 800-902-6969 Again 800-902-6969
[00:54:23.268 --> 00:54:27.375]  Okay, I'm done talking about Glenn Beck, but that's all anybody's talking about.
[00:54:28.677 --> 00:54:35.468]  And so, it was a stunt to go to the Lincoln Memorial on the day of Martin Luther King.
[00:54:36.761 --> 00:54:38.282]  And I think it was a brilliant stunt.
[00:54:38.743 --> 00:54:41.325]  I mean, that's what the Democrats and the Liberals do.
[00:54:42.386 --> 00:54:45.829]  The problem is, we know Beck is handled by the Republican Party.
[00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:53.575]  The Republican Party, a year and a half ago, saw the fact that all over the country they were being booed at town hall meetings.
[00:54:54.156 --> 00:54:58.359]  And so they teamed up with the Liberal media to come out and say the Tea Party is their right wing.
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.841]  And the controlled left went along with that hoax.
[00:55:01.502 --> 00:55:13.590]  The Republicans tried to co-opt the Tea Party, to a great extent they did, so that the revolution against tyranny is now controlled by one of the two parties that's bought and paid for by the very same special interest.
[00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:15.331]  It's that simple.
[00:55:16.752 --> 00:55:17.612]  It's that simple.
[00:55:18.413 --> 00:55:25.818]  And it also makes the movement about presidents and about Washington, instead of taking our counties, our cities, and our states back.
[00:55:26.638 --> 00:55:28.940]  This is what we need to do.
[00:55:30.046 --> 00:55:31.987]  This is what we need to do now.
[00:55:32.927 --> 00:55:35.348]  It is so vitally important.
[00:55:36.568 --> 00:55:50.012]  And all I'm saying is, I'm going to put out the Glenn Beck deception, I'm going to be criticized just like the Obama deception, and then people are going to see it a year or two later, and they're going to say, how did this guy know all this?
[00:55:51.592 --> 00:55:53.993]  Because I've studied these people.
[00:55:54.613 --> 00:55:55.673]  I've got their playbook.
[00:55:56.474 --> 00:55:57.254]  I understand it.
[00:55:58.965 --> 00:56:05.046]  I was called a communist when I didn't like George W. Bush.
[00:56:06.087 --> 00:56:08.747]  I'm called a right-wing extremist because I don't like Barack Obama.
[00:56:09.087 --> 00:56:10.448]  It's so elementary.
[00:56:10.908 --> 00:56:12.188]  These guys are puppets.
[00:56:12.968 --> 00:56:14.709]  These guys are front men.
[00:56:15.229 --> 00:56:18.530]  They give you different rhetoric, but they vote the same.
[00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:23.851]  And the system knew they were going to put Obama in.
[00:56:24.758 --> 00:56:25.479]  Here's the issue.
[00:56:25.699 --> 00:56:29.061]  The Republicans, you better not just get satisfied by them getting an office.
[00:56:29.301 --> 00:56:31.063]  You better repeal all the government health care.
[00:56:31.923 --> 00:56:33.044]  Already bankrupting the nation.
[00:56:33.585 --> 00:56:35.866]  They better repeal the banker bailouts.
[00:56:36.327 --> 00:56:40.250]  They better repeal the expanded power for the Federal Reserve and audit it.
[00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:43.032]  They better get our troops out of all these countries.
[00:56:43.252 --> 00:56:44.193]  We're going bankrupt.
[00:56:44.433 --> 00:56:48.016]  But don't look for that unless you keep their feet to the fire.
[00:56:49.363 --> 00:56:50.424]  That's my main message.
[00:56:50.645 --> 00:56:51.806]  Just like I told Democrats.
[00:56:52.307 --> 00:56:52.727]  Obama?
[00:56:52.987 --> 00:56:54.309]  Nothing but lobbyists he hired.
[00:56:55.050 --> 00:56:56.111]  Continuing the torture.
[00:56:56.391 --> 00:56:57.893]  Continuing the banking bailouts.
[00:56:59.015 --> 00:57:00.476]  And now they're getting disillusioned.
[00:57:00.677 --> 00:57:01.858]  But who do they go vote for?
[00:57:02.158 --> 00:57:02.839]  Republicans?
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.302]  Well, you don't vote for establishment Republicans.
[00:57:06.223 --> 00:57:08.025]  But if you can find a constitutionalist...
[00:57:08.891 --> 00:57:19.314]  There are better candidates being fielded through the Republican Party and the Libertarian Party, because they do, at least on paper, have more Americana views.
[00:57:21.175 --> 00:57:22.655]  But this is how the globalists manage it.
[00:57:22.875 --> 00:57:33.779]  The Republicans, they kind of play the part of establishment, and then the Democrats get in and take us down the road, and then Republicans get back in power and never repeal any of the tyranny.
[00:57:35.759 --> 00:57:38.040]  And Republicans launch the military tyranny.
[00:57:40.171 --> 00:57:52.666]  The Democrats launch all of their creeping socialism tyranny, and expand military tyranny, and expand domestic tyranny, and then Republicans get in and do the same things.
[00:57:52.966 --> 00:57:54.628]  They just do it for different reasons.
[00:57:54.868 --> 00:57:56.270]  I got one minute left in this hour.
[00:57:56.571 --> 00:57:59.013]  This special is really exciting a lot of people.
[00:57:59.694 --> 00:58:02.595]  And it's available at Infowars.com for about another week and a half.
[00:58:02.615 --> 00:58:03.895]  And we're getting rid of the special.
[00:58:04.215 --> 00:58:06.376]  You can get five great films for $9.95.
[00:58:07.436 --> 00:58:12.057]  High-quality, shrink-wrapped, hardcover DVDs with expanded extras.
[00:58:12.437 --> 00:58:14.338]  Terror Storm, history government-sponsored terror.
[00:58:14.638 --> 00:58:16.559]  How Weed Won the West, about the phony drug war.
[00:58:17.039 --> 00:58:19.339]  Fabled Enemies, about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:58:19.659 --> 00:58:21.020]  Aaron Russo, Reflections and Warnings.
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:22.260]  And American Dictators, $9.95.

[00:58:30.023 --> 00:58:30.303]  Get them.
[00:58:30.544 --> 00:58:31.564]  Get them out to everybody you know.
[00:58:31.604 --> 00:58:33.085]  Got a bunch of other specials running as well.

[00:58:53.809 --> 00:58:54.710]  Tyranny is here.

[00:58:58.953 --> 00:59:01.235]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:01.415 --> 00:59:06.699]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:07.119 --> 00:59:13.364]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:13.764 --> 00:59:19.307]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:19.747 --> 00:59:23.409]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:23.929 --> 00:59:27.911]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:28.212 --> 00:59:33.714]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:34.155 --> 00:59:37.116]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:37.717 --> 00:59:39.137]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:39.698 --> 00:59:40.118]  It's here.

[01:00:04.355 --> 01:00:08.521]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.182 --> 01:00:10.003]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.764 --> 01:00:11.685]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.326 --> 01:00:15.991]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:20.577]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.228 --> 01:00:24.950]  All right, my friends, the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:25.050]  800-259-9231.
[01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:34.518]  I spent much of the last hour talking about Glenn Beck, his rally, and how he is saying a lot of the right things, but is being used, just like Obama said a lot of the right things,
[01:00:47.549 --> 01:00:51.430]  And once they get the Republicans back in power, you're going to see the same sellout.
[01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:55.512]  Because both these parties are bought and paid for by the same interest.
[01:00:55.592 --> 01:01:01.354]  And they've got think tanks, focus groups, you name it, on how to con you, how to bamboozle you.
[01:01:02.034 --> 01:01:10.797]  And I have a responsibility to not have my work, my research, my ideas of true constitutional populism taken by Glenn Beck.
[01:01:11.929 --> 01:01:19.352]  And it's admitted that he's doing this and turning it into a kind of Republican-oid version of what we do.
[01:01:19.772 --> 01:01:23.874]  And so I'm going to make the Glenn Beck deception and I'm going to rush it out in the next two months.
[01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:26.335]  I'm shifting all my attention to this.
[01:01:26.395 --> 01:01:27.636]  I'm not going to screw around anymore.
[01:01:28.576 --> 01:01:34.201]  Because I had a moment of clarity understanding this and it's the right thing to do and I'm going to do it.
[01:01:34.262 --> 01:01:38.746]  I'm going to expose him because it has to be done just like with Obama.
[01:01:39.406 --> 01:01:43.810]  I went up against Obama when he was at his ultimate, you know, star had risen.
[01:01:44.511 --> 01:01:51.455]  Because if we'd allowed him to become this messianic leader and carrying their agenda, he could have taken the country down.
[01:01:51.495 --> 01:01:53.536]  He's already done a pretty good job as a front man.
[01:01:54.017 --> 01:02:06.104]  It's the same thing with this coterie, you know, this four horsemen of the neocons, Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, and then kind of an amalgamation of the others being the fourth horseman.
[01:02:06.865 --> 01:02:09.026]  And we've got to expose these four horsemen now.
[01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:15.134]  Because I've seen their track record, I know who they are, I know where they're going, and I'm just going to lay it out for people.
[01:02:16.015 --> 01:02:18.417]  So I'm done talking about it, but if you want to call in, that's fine.
[01:02:18.717 --> 01:02:20.278]  Okay, here's the other news.
[01:02:21.439 --> 01:02:23.901]  Watson is coming on in the next hour to talk about this.
[01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:25.482]  This is a big deal.
[01:02:25.883 --> 01:02:30.346]  We have a chance to save a lot of people's lives, and save a lot of people from serious heartache.
[01:02:32.728 --> 01:02:35.750]  Finland, England, India, a bunch of other countries,
[01:02:36.604 --> 01:02:41.130]  Have come out and said, look, we don't know what's in that H1N1 shot, but it's brain damaging people.
[01:02:41.631 --> 01:02:42.512]  It's killing people.
[01:02:42.992 --> 01:02:43.833]  We're suspending it.
[01:02:45.455 --> 01:02:50.963]  Well, I know what's in it, and I've had brain surgeons and top scientists on, and so we're going to try to save some lives here.
[01:02:51.909 --> 01:02:58.593]  We're not going to distract you by the mosque controversy itself, literally run by Fox News and the CIA.
[01:02:59.034 --> 01:03:00.515]  That whole thing's staged on both sides.
[01:03:01.355 --> 01:03:02.676]  Distractions like that.
[01:03:03.216 --> 01:03:04.998]  We're going to cover something that affects everybody.
[01:03:05.398 --> 01:03:08.540]  Whether you're a Christian, a Muslim, a Jew, an atheist, okay?
[01:03:10.521 --> 01:03:15.945]  Also on the First Amendment issue, Sotomayor is saying that they may have to restrict the First Amendment.
[01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:20.328]  You gotta love these operatives they put in.
[01:03:22.771 --> 01:03:27.274]  Also, DOJ, Department of Justice, demonizes Constitutionalists as extremist criminals.
[01:03:27.294 --> 01:03:30.336]  We're going to be going over that report as well.
[01:03:30.716 --> 01:03:33.598]  The government think tank calls for infiltrating conspiracy websites.
[01:03:33.919 --> 01:03:34.599]  This is new.
[01:03:34.759 --> 01:03:39.162]  This is actually the London Independent, so it dovetails with the whole Cass Sunstein situation.
[01:03:40.323 --> 01:03:49.669]  And I also want to get into the Roger Clemens situation a little bit and dovetail that with some issues.
[01:03:52.759 --> 01:03:54.839]  I'll give you an example of contemporary corruption.
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:04:07.122]  And then, every day I come in, and I send the crew stories that I see dealing with immigration, and they always print some out for me.
[01:04:08.142 --> 01:04:20.645]  And really, what we discovered to be going on a decade ago or more in Mexico, and now intensifying in the last five years, is now just publicly available information.
[01:04:26.588 --> 01:04:39.257]  And there's this contrast between the fact that Mexico is being imploded by design and the fact that still the American people don't seem to understand this.
[01:04:39.757 --> 01:04:40.517]  So that's coming up.
[01:04:40.538 --> 01:04:45.401]  But first, I'm going to take some of your phone calls here today.
[01:04:46.241 --> 01:04:48.603]  Amy, Mike, Delta, Corey, David, and others.
[01:04:49.123 --> 01:04:49.744]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:49.764 --> 01:04:52.405]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:52.526 --> 01:04:52.966]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.983 --> 01:05:03.926]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:10.211]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:05:10.571 --> 01:05:17.677]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:05:17.957 --> 01:05:22.541]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:05:22.841 --> 01:05:24.983]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:05:27.785 --> 01:05:31.307]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:05:31.527 --> 01:05:33.788]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:05:33.828 --> 01:05:34.149]  Call us!

[01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.140]  Thank you!
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:07.202]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions.
[01:06:07.763 --> 01:06:15.045]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:06:16.095 --> 01:06:19.816]  My name is Mario Cifaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:20.777 --> 01:06:32.802]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:06:33.542 --> 01:06:40.805]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:06:41.505 --> 01:06:51.116]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:06:51.877 --> 01:06:55.161]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:06:55.802 --> 01:06:58.906]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:06:59.446 --> 01:07:03.670]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.590]  Number one.
[01:07:04.911 --> 01:07:08.053]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.334 --> 01:07:08.894]  Number two.
[01:07:09.194 --> 01:07:13.738]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.078 --> 01:07:14.519]  It's true.
[01:07:14.819 --> 01:07:19.383]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:20.244]  Number three.
[01:07:20.524 --> 01:07:23.807]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.107 --> 01:07:27.810]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:28.551]  Number 4.
[01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:31.173]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:31.553 --> 01:07:34.956]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.236 --> 01:07:35.457]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.037 --> 01:07:39.960]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:44.945]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.225 --> 01:07:49.252]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.392 --> 01:07:50.975]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.195 --> 01:07:53.279]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:53.439 --> 01:07:55.783]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:59.502 --> 01:08:00.043]  We've got it.
[01:08:00.083 --> 01:08:06.531]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:08:06.611 --> 01:08:10.737]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:11.017 --> 01:08:16.605]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:08:20.008 --> 01:08:23.291]  Okay, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:24.472 --> 01:08:26.795]  Coming up, Mexican massacre.
[01:08:27.295 --> 01:08:28.736]  Investigator found dead.
[01:08:28.756 --> 01:08:38.585]  The gentleman that investigated the 72 immigrants from Central and South America who had been killed execution style, reportedly by Los Zetas.
[01:08:38.625 --> 01:08:39.366]  He's been killed.
[01:08:40.287 --> 01:08:44.691]  A second mayor has been taken out of his house and murdered in front of his family.
[01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:48.482]  Two car bombs explode in northern Mexico.
[01:08:50.643 --> 01:08:52.484]  Mexicans fear cartels are winning.
[01:08:52.644 --> 01:08:56.385]  Mexican illicit cultivation of opium poppies is exploding.
[01:08:57.966 --> 01:09:01.067]  The more illegal you make drugs, the more money they make, the more drugs you have.
[01:09:01.987 --> 01:09:05.108]  Brewer condemns report to UN mentioning Arizona law.
[01:09:05.529 --> 01:09:06.029]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:08.610]  Obama isn't worried about Mexico collapsing.
[01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:17.573]  Or the fact that CIA train Los Zetas is down there kidnapping people en masse and now kidnapping US citizens constantly and demanding money.
[01:09:17.873 --> 01:09:18.634]  That's not an issue.
[01:09:19.874 --> 01:09:27.057]  The fact that police might pull over an illegal alien for drunk driving and ask for their driver's license, that's the issue.
[01:09:27.077 --> 01:09:29.758]  Now if you're a citizen, you gotta show papers, lick boots.
[01:09:29.778 --> 01:09:31.379]  If you're an illegal, you're above the law.
[01:09:32.159 --> 01:09:34.200]  And so Obama's going to the UN for that.
[01:09:35.851 --> 01:09:43.214]  And of course, we have Arizona sheriffs saying the Border Patrol has retreated from the border because it's too dangerous and there's murder hits out on them.
[01:09:43.775 --> 01:09:49.037]  So the United States government, hey, they've got fat, dumb, and happy Americans to shake down.
[01:09:50.958 --> 01:09:52.098]  And I've done research on that.
[01:09:52.138 --> 01:09:55.880]  Our Border Patrol is becoming extremely corrupt, being paid off as well.
[01:09:58.661 --> 01:09:59.382]  Both sides.
[01:10:00.984 --> 01:10:01.784]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[01:10:02.144 --> 01:10:02.985]  So that's coming up.
[01:10:03.005 --> 01:10:04.565]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:10:05.025 --> 01:10:06.886]  Amy in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:10:06.906 --> 01:10:08.867]  Hi.
[01:10:08.887 --> 01:10:09.527]  Hi.
[01:10:10.027 --> 01:10:11.047]  Nice talking to you.
[01:10:11.188 --> 01:10:12.328]  I'm enjoying your show.
[01:10:12.368 --> 01:10:15.049]  I've been listening to you for a couple of months on the Internet.
[01:10:15.749 --> 01:10:21.311]  What I'm... I have watched Glenn Beck before, and you've been talking about him today.
[01:10:21.891 --> 01:10:26.933]  The thing I don't understand is how do people not get that there's a new world order?
[01:10:28.449 --> 01:10:32.312]  I guess is it the media that, you know, are they puppets?
[01:10:32.793 --> 01:10:39.057]  Well, look, I mean, of course, I mean, the dominant media is owned by the very same banking institutions who can create unlimited money.
[01:10:39.718 --> 01:10:42.020]  And so what do you think you're going to see from these people?
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:45.843]  So they put in fake liberals to lead the liberal opposition.
[01:10:46.143 --> 01:10:50.466]  They put in fake conservatives to lead the Republican opposition.
[01:10:50.486 --> 01:10:50.546]  And
[01:10:52.873 --> 01:10:55.755]  I mean, where was Glenn Beck during the banker bailout under Bush?
[01:10:55.895 --> 01:10:56.756]  He was supporting it.
[01:10:57.096 --> 01:10:58.537]  Where was he with the Patriot Act?
[01:10:58.937 --> 01:10:59.858]  He was supporting it.
[01:11:00.518 --> 01:11:03.581]  And he's going to support it all when Republicans are in office.
[01:11:03.861 --> 01:11:08.784]  And then Democrats are going to be against torture and wars and the Patriot Act.
[01:11:09.004 --> 01:11:11.606]  But they're all for it because they're in power now.
[01:11:12.007 --> 01:11:15.289]  The very same special interests own these people.
[01:11:15.589 --> 01:11:16.690]  It's so elementary.
[01:11:18.411 --> 01:11:26.896]  My issue with Glenn Beck is he's being built up by the left and the right as the opposition leader so he can lead the opposition.
[01:11:27.156 --> 01:11:28.397]  I mean, it's so elementary.
[01:11:28.657 --> 01:11:31.338]  You had Ron Paul creating the Tea Parties in 2007.
[01:11:33.119 --> 01:11:40.864]  You had a true libertarian, conservative, anti-globalist movement who was anti-war, anti-Federal Reserve, pro-state's rights.
[01:11:41.784 --> 01:11:42.124]  I think?
[01:12:00.476 --> 01:12:08.822]  And everything so that I can prepare for his Lord and Savior Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich and bow down to them.
[01:12:08.842 --> 01:12:11.344]  I mean, it's so obvious what's going on.
[01:12:11.584 --> 01:12:14.065]  He's controlled by the same people that run Obama.
[01:12:14.566 --> 01:12:18.248]  But see, even the liberal media is now turning their back on Obama.
[01:12:18.288 --> 01:12:19.109]  He's off message.
[01:12:19.149 --> 01:12:20.009]  He's got problems.
[01:12:20.029 --> 01:12:20.650]  He's arrogant.
[01:12:21.874 --> 01:12:27.716]  They're getting ready to destroy Obama and bring in the next puppet who will then be destroyed.
[01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:34.559]  And we're all, like a moth towards the flame, obsessed with this instead of looking at the puppet masters.
[01:12:34.839 --> 01:12:35.879]  What did Bill Hicks say?
[01:12:36.319 --> 01:12:38.080]  Got a puppet on the left, puppet on the right.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:39.000]  Wait a minute!
[01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:40.881]  There's one guy holding both puppets!
[01:12:44.602 --> 01:12:45.883]  Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[01:12:46.343 --> 01:12:48.044]  Let's go to Mike in Colorado.
[01:12:48.084 --> 01:12:48.964]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:50.665]  How's it going?
[01:12:50.745 --> 01:12:51.045]  Good, sir.
[01:12:52.299 --> 01:12:53.619]  I appreciate coming on your show.
[01:12:53.639 --> 01:13:02.002]  You know, I listened to Glenn Beck for over a year, you know, constantly at some advice of my family.
[01:13:02.022 --> 01:13:11.465]  And then at advice of a different friend, I started listening to you and stopped listening to Glenn Beck for listening to you for at least over a year, at least two and a half hours every day.
[01:13:12.125 --> 01:13:17.707]  So I have a good feeling I've watched most of your videos of what's going on and your perspective versus Glenn's perspective.
[01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:21.868]  And one thing I wanted to take you to task on is this thing about him supporting the TARP bailout.
[01:13:22.987 --> 01:13:32.776]  He said multiple times on his show that he did not, at first he thought it was a good idea, and three days later he said, no, it's not a good idea, I was wrong.
[01:13:32.976 --> 01:13:33.777]  After it passed!
[01:13:34.938 --> 01:13:37.701]  But still, I mean, you're not giving him any benefit of the doubt on that.
[01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:44.256]  And you look at the big picture all the time, trying to say you just know for sure, you know, like he's some kind of an evil person.
[01:13:44.276 --> 01:13:45.037]  I just don't believe it.
[01:13:45.077 --> 01:13:46.078]  Well, you watch.
[01:13:46.698 --> 01:13:49.061]  I don't know how many Democrats told me the same thing about Obama.
[01:13:49.081 --> 01:13:49.821]  Just watch, buddy.
[01:13:50.222 --> 01:13:57.869]  But don't lie to yourself so much, Mike, that after you see what's going to happen to this country when the Republicans get control of things,
[01:13:58.610 --> 01:14:06.616]  Just remember that you got committed and wedded to him just like Clinton supporters, or George W. Bush supporters, or Obama supporters.
[01:14:06.656 --> 01:14:08.357]  But let me explain something to you.
[01:14:09.558 --> 01:14:12.000]  And then I want to hear you have your say, Mike.
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:12.881]  Okay?
[01:14:14.522 --> 01:14:24.129]  I mean, believe me, if I only cared about Alex Jones in my radio career, I wouldn't have come on air and said 9-11 was an inside job before it happened and after it happened.
[01:14:24.409 --> 01:14:25.190]  The day it happened.
[01:14:27.028 --> 01:14:28.649]  You think that was a popular thing to do?
[01:14:28.769 --> 01:14:29.369]  No, it wasn't.
[01:14:30.189 --> 01:14:39.712]  Do you think going after Obama when he was at the ultimate peak of his messianic success, you think that was to win a popularity contest?
[01:14:40.992 --> 01:14:44.133]  There was plenty of people that were going after him all over the place at that time.
[01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:48.635]  But not from the perspective of a constitutionalist.
[01:14:48.675 --> 01:14:54.537]  They were going after him from a right-wing perspective, and he had a huge approval rating of almost 90%.
[01:14:56.584 --> 01:14:58.465]  Now, let me just stop for just a moment here.
[01:14:59.825 --> 01:15:01.766]  Benedict Arnold won many battles.
[01:15:02.146 --> 01:15:03.387]  Do you know who Benedict Arnold is?
[01:15:04.687 --> 01:15:05.368]  No, I can't.
[01:15:05.388 --> 01:15:05.968]  I've heard the name.
[01:15:06.028 --> 01:15:06.728]  I can't place it.
[01:15:06.848 --> 01:15:09.529]  Okay, he was almost as famous as George Washington.
[01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:24.295]  He was a Continental Army, and then, you know, later, he was one of the generals in the War for Independence against the British.
[01:15:24.696 --> 01:15:25.576]  You know about that, right?
[01:15:26.499 --> 01:15:26.719]  Right.
[01:15:27.619 --> 01:15:36.863]  Okay, now Benedict Arnold would give great speeches, he was a wonderful guy, he would win these battles, but it turned out the whole time he was a British double agent.
[01:15:38.444 --> 01:15:47.168]  And at key points, when the British had a chance to once and for all smash the rebels, that's when he revealed himself.
[01:15:47.248 --> 01:15:52.650]  Now, they were getting a thousand to one phone calls against the TARP bill.
[01:15:53.925 --> 01:15:55.686]  The Congress had said no.
[01:15:56.146 --> 01:16:09.352]  The bankers had plunged the stock market by a thousand points to terrorize the public, and they had all the top bankers come out and say, we're going to have a depression if you don't give us this banker bailout.
[01:16:09.752 --> 01:16:11.853]  And then October 3rd, they passed it.
[01:16:12.253 --> 01:16:22.638]  October 4th, the head of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, said, I'm not going to tell you where the money went.
[01:16:23.632 --> 01:16:29.357]  Now, Beck, sure, a few weeks later said, ooh, I was wrong, I apologize, I misunderstood.
[01:16:29.917 --> 01:16:47.793]  Just like he misunderstood when he read word-for-word out of the Southern Poverty Law Center's hit pieces on Ron Paul, right when Ron Paul had a chance of winning the nomination, right at that key point, right at the key point, whenever Deborah Medina had a chance to torpedo her.
[01:16:48.889 --> 01:17:00.691]  Right at, always at the key point, his periscope comes up, when he's got your confidence, and he fires torpedoes, and... I have been there.
[01:17:00.911 --> 01:17:01.571]  I have seen it.
[01:17:02.071 --> 01:17:02.932]  I have witnessed it.
[01:17:03.512 --> 01:17:05.772]  And I know who runs Fox News.
[01:17:06.552 --> 01:17:12.633]  I mean, I've been here all these years, and many others have, exposing world government, being laughed at by the Fox News crowd.
[01:17:13.193 --> 01:17:16.594]  Now they come out and say, okay, it's all real, because the globalists have gone public.
[01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:24.256]  But then they still say, okay, it's real, but if you don't, you know, basically agree with us, you're a kook, it still doesn't exist.
[01:17:25.317 --> 01:17:28.179]  I mean, have you heard Glenn Beck make fun of people that talk about Voldemort?
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.322]  I wanted to, that's what I wanted to say, Nick.
[01:17:31.642 --> 01:17:42.991]  You know, when he, I was doing a show about a month ago, maybe even less, and he can't, and a lot of the followers of Glenn Beck say, you know, he's speaking cryptically about different things because he can't come out and say things outright.
[01:17:43.624 --> 01:17:50.307]  And I personally believe, you know, that he's not a bad person trying to mislead, that he's more of a pawn... What do you mean he can't come out?
[01:17:50.467 --> 01:17:50.887]  Hey, hey!
[01:17:51.467 --> 01:17:55.009]  Listen, buddy, I was offered everything Lynne Beck's been given, okay?
[01:17:55.269 --> 01:17:56.389]  And I said no to it.
[01:17:56.829 --> 01:17:58.130]  What do you mean he can't come out?
[01:17:58.939 --> 01:18:02.301]  Well, he apparently feels like he didn't... No, that's a sellout!
[01:18:02.361 --> 01:18:03.782]  See, this is why we're slaves.
[01:18:04.123 --> 01:18:05.844]  This is why we're going to lose everything, Mike.
[01:18:06.064 --> 01:18:07.465]  Okay, there's a good chance we're going to lose.
[01:18:08.105 --> 01:18:10.527]  And down the road, you're going to say Alex Jones was right.
[01:18:11.288 --> 01:18:14.029]  It's this attitude of, he can't come out all the way.
[01:18:14.970 --> 01:18:17.132]  This attitude of, he's got to speak in code.
[01:18:17.392 --> 01:18:24.857]  He's got to write a book, the Overton Window, saying this is faction, this is real stuff in fiction.
[01:18:24.877 --> 01:18:27.339]  At the end, he says the government's not staged in terror.
[01:18:28.626 --> 01:18:31.909]  There aren't FEMA camps, and this book is fiction.
[01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:33.331]  That's doublespeak.
[01:18:33.671 --> 01:18:34.652]  This is faction.
[01:18:34.913 --> 01:18:36.034]  This is really going on.
[01:18:36.294 --> 01:18:39.638]  At the end, okay, you bought my book, you read it, this isn't going on.
[01:18:40.058 --> 01:18:41.139]  It's confusion.
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:43.001]  That's what I'm telling you.
[01:18:43.702 --> 01:18:44.763]  That's what I'm telling you.
[01:18:45.104 --> 01:18:47.967]  Listen, I know people at Fox News, high up.
[01:18:48.467 --> 01:18:50.609]  You understand Glenn Beck is obsessed with this show.
[01:18:51.129 --> 01:18:54.052]  Glenn Beck has five operatives listening right now.
[01:18:54.472 --> 01:18:57.575]  Glenn Beck tells people, don't go on Alex Jones' show.
[01:18:57.896 --> 01:19:01.939]  Glenn Beck goes around to radio executives saying, don't have him on the radio.
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:04.441]  Glenn Beck is scared of the Patriot movement.
[01:19:04.622 --> 01:19:10.567]  He's got two retired FBI agents guarding him, not from Muslims, but from Patriots.
[01:19:11.548 --> 01:19:14.050]  And listen, I know a lot about Glenn Beck you don't know.
[01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.731]  Do you understand that?
[01:19:15.285 --> 01:19:16.266]  Well yeah, that's what I want to know.
[01:19:16.566 --> 01:19:22.910]  I would like your confirmation that, so you have a 100% confirmed source that the people at Fox News that he's doing that stuff.
[01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.891]  Absolutely.
[01:19:24.771 --> 01:19:29.014]  And the other thing, and I know you can just say that this is, you know, more confusion.
[01:19:29.355 --> 01:19:36.219]  He specifically stated in his talk radio show is that, look, he doesn't deal with the things that other, quote, other talk radio shows talk about.
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:38.701]  He's not, that's not what his show's about.
[01:19:38.761 --> 01:19:39.862]  He's basically saying to me,
[01:19:40.549 --> 01:19:42.790]  Look, I'm not going to talk about what Alex Jones is talking about.
[01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:44.050]  I'm talking about different stuff.
[01:19:44.890 --> 01:19:45.871]  And that's not what his show is about.
[01:19:45.891 --> 01:19:46.611]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:19:46.731 --> 01:19:50.112]  Long before I now discovered I ever talked about Glenn Beck.
[01:19:50.132 --> 01:19:54.353]  In fact, four or five years ago, I was supportive of him until I saw him reading ADL stuff on air.
[01:19:54.593 --> 01:19:55.433]  Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:19:55.713 --> 01:19:56.074]  Stay there.
[01:19:56.114 --> 01:19:56.714]  This is important.
[01:19:56.734 --> 01:19:57.374]  We'll come back to you.
[01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:02.391]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?

[01:20:59.744 --> 01:21:02.767]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:21:03.108 --> 01:21:06.731]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:21:07.032 --> 01:21:10.475]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[01:24:20.649 --> 01:24:22.771]  Okay, I don't want to spend all day on Glenn Beck.
[01:24:23.531 --> 01:24:25.493]  That's why I'm going to make a documentary about him.
[01:24:26.153 --> 01:24:27.554]  I'm going to show his flip-flopping.
[01:24:27.914 --> 01:24:29.215]  I'm going to show who funds him.
[01:24:30.036 --> 01:24:39.383]  I'm going to show the Republicans on Fox saying there's no world government, there's no banking plan, there's no international bankers, there's no derivatives.
[01:24:40.044 --> 01:24:42.205]  They all are paid for by the same people.
[01:24:42.245 --> 01:24:43.106]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:24:44.627 --> 01:24:49.391]  Now, does there tend to be some better people of the few good Senators and House members that are Republican?
[01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:51.952]  Uh, like Senator DeMint?
[01:24:52.553 --> 01:24:53.334]  Or Ron Paul?
[01:24:53.614 --> 01:24:54.575]  Yes, that's the case.
[01:24:54.875 --> 01:24:57.118]  Do I have more in common with Republicans?
[01:24:57.619 --> 01:24:57.959]  Yes.
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.984]  Because they at least claim they're constitutionalist.
[01:25:03.871 --> 01:25:06.772]  But when they get in power, they forget the Constitution.
[01:25:07.212 --> 01:25:09.473]  Obama claimed he was this big civil libertarian.
[01:25:09.773 --> 01:25:10.653]  Look what he's done.
[01:25:10.913 --> 01:25:11.893]  Remember Keith Oberman?
[01:25:12.413 --> 01:25:16.154]  How he was exposing tyranny and Cheney wanting to blow up U.S.
[01:25:16.194 --> 01:25:19.695]  ships and blame it on Iran and all these things, and now Obama's in?
[01:25:19.715 --> 01:25:21.796]  And you don't hear any criticism of Obama?
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:30.962]  And all you see from MSNBC is race pimping, hyping religious differences.
[01:25:31.262 --> 01:25:32.562]  It's the same thing from Fox.
[01:25:33.302 --> 01:25:37.423]  And they do it in the name of unity, but all they do is raise these issues.
[01:25:37.844 --> 01:25:40.764]  They are working from the same sheet of music.
[01:25:41.805 --> 01:25:45.526]  Just one takes the part of the villain, one takes the part of the good guy.
[01:25:46.126 --> 01:25:48.266]  Depending on what perspective you've got.
[01:25:48.567 --> 01:25:50.247]  If you're a Democrat, Obama's good.
[01:25:50.707 --> 01:25:52.488]  If you're a Republican, Obama's bad.
[01:25:52.788 --> 01:25:53.508]  Vice versa.
[01:25:54.990 --> 01:26:10.278]  And I'm gonna go after Glenn Beck, because I know that he's put out the word to try to keep me off radio stations and off the air.
[01:26:11.579 --> 01:26:16.942]  I know he's put out the word for people not to go on my show, or he threatens to blackball them.
[01:26:18.141 --> 01:26:29.011]  I know he's got at least five people that listen to my show and track everything I do, and then he's got the nerve to try to be involved in my life, stopping me from getting the word out.
[01:26:29.231 --> 01:26:31.193]  Well, of course, he copies everything I am.
[01:26:31.454 --> 01:26:32.094]  He twists it.
[01:26:32.414 --> 01:26:35.417]  He turns it into a Roger Ailes Fox production.
[01:26:36.378 --> 01:26:37.679]  It comes back on me.
[01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:40.982]  I've got to have little old ladies saying, you sound just like Glenn Beck.
[01:26:41.042 --> 01:26:42.223]  No, I don't, old lady.
[01:26:42.544 --> 01:26:43.505]  Listen a little closer.
[01:26:45.253 --> 01:26:49.918]  So I need to stand up and identify who I am versus what Glenn Beck is.
[01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:53.643]  For heaven's sakes, Mike, I'm going to go back and give you the final word on this.
[01:26:54.824 --> 01:26:56.786]  I've now had a chance to read almost the whole book.
[01:26:58.028 --> 01:26:58.969]  The Overton Window.
[01:27:00.945 --> 01:27:04.847]  And the character Bailey is Alex Jones!
[01:27:05.468 --> 01:27:10.390]  It's a Patriot talk show host who releases the MIAC report that law enforcement gave him.
[01:27:10.751 --> 01:27:11.231]  That's me.
[01:27:12.011 --> 01:27:13.032]  We're the ones that released it.
[01:27:13.752 --> 01:27:15.293]  Kansas City Star on record.
[01:27:18.055 --> 01:27:23.178]  And I'm stopping the nukes that the government wants to detonate to bring in martial law.
[01:27:24.873 --> 01:27:27.736]  It's about false flag terror, international bankers.
[01:27:28.057 --> 01:27:33.602]  Meanwhile, he's saying anybody that thinks the government stages terror attacks is a dangerous lunatic.
[01:27:36.586 --> 01:27:38.548]  See, that's a true master manipulator.
[01:27:39.525 --> 01:27:40.566]  Is that he wants it all.
[01:27:40.646 --> 01:27:41.906]  He sees it as a market.
[01:27:42.747 --> 01:27:45.228]  And he is going to be an establishment Republican.
[01:27:45.728 --> 01:27:52.532]  He's going to then be the mediator who referees when the conspiracy people get out of control.
[01:27:52.952 --> 01:27:55.794]  He's going to get up on TV and warn about the militias.
[01:27:58.430 --> 01:28:03.913]  And when the Republicans get into power, he's going to attack those of us that expose their globalist agenda.
[01:28:04.373 --> 01:28:09.336]  He's going to say, we've got to have this Bank of the World, we've got to have this carbon tax to fund it.
[01:28:09.696 --> 01:28:13.018]  Gee, I don't like it, but we're going to go bankrupt if we don't.
[01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:17.061]  Now, go ahead.
[01:28:17.441 --> 01:28:18.561]  You have the final word, Mike.
[01:28:18.601 --> 01:28:18.922]  Go ahead.
[01:28:20.402 --> 01:28:25.285]  Well, I mean, you have definitely, you know, quite a prediction you made there.
[01:28:25.305 --> 01:28:26.646]  I do have to say that
[01:28:27.202 --> 01:28:31.423]  The bottom line for me with Glenn Beck is, I don't discount his faith in God.
[01:28:31.463 --> 01:28:34.104]  I do happen to be Mormon, so I have a bias in that point.
[01:28:34.904 --> 01:28:36.924]  I don't think he is intentionally misleading.
[01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:38.325]  You know he didn't write those books.
[01:28:38.845 --> 01:28:40.385]  He has writers writing that crap.
[01:28:40.985 --> 01:28:46.727]  You know, he's being handled like he said, so I'm not going to demonize him personally because I believe it.
[01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:50.008]  He does have a sincere belief in God and in helping us out.
[01:28:50.088 --> 01:28:51.248]  If he's being manipulated,
[01:28:51.713 --> 01:28:54.355]  I'm not going to blame him as much as I'm going to blame the manipulators.
[01:28:54.395 --> 01:28:55.436]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:28:55.556 --> 01:29:04.762]  Why would he go on a photo shoot and put fake tears in his eyes and laugh for the media and say this is how I fool people?
[01:29:06.523 --> 01:29:07.544]  That I don't even know about.
[01:29:07.564 --> 01:29:08.485]  I couldn't speak to it.
[01:29:09.289 --> 01:29:09.750]  I'll look it up.
[01:29:27.907 --> 01:29:32.309]  And point out what our concerns are once the Republicans get back into power.
[01:29:32.649 --> 01:29:34.389]  Because all I want is my country back.
[01:29:34.869 --> 01:29:38.711]  And I've seen a track record of Republicans and Democrats sharing power.
[01:29:39.391 --> 01:29:40.431]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:29:40.491 --> 01:29:41.192]  Interesting points.
[01:29:41.232 --> 01:29:42.372]  I hope you're right about Glenn Beck.
[01:29:49.955 --> 01:29:50.895]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.355 --> 01:29:52.956]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.876 --> 01:29:56.577]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.113 --> 01:30:01.856]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:30:02.236 --> 01:30:05.759]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:08.682]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.

[01:32:55.257 --> 01:32:56.017]  Check them out today.
[01:33:07.333 --> 01:33:15.619]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:18.982]  Look, I'm done talking about Glenn Beck.
[01:33:19.022 --> 01:33:24.686]  You can raise it if you want when we take your calls here in a moment, but it's really elementary.
[01:33:28.303 --> 01:33:30.784]  Fox News is the establishment.
[01:33:31.064 --> 01:33:37.606]  They sold the lies about WMDs, the torture, the secret arrest, the Patriot Act.
[01:33:38.246 --> 01:33:43.307]  They are always big cheerleaders for arresting militias who are getting set up by the feds.
[01:33:43.327 --> 01:33:46.308]  I mean, Fox News is a whorehouse.
[01:33:47.028 --> 01:33:49.989]  And they know that people are waking up to the New World Order.
[01:33:50.269 --> 01:33:53.230]  They know that I've done my job, Ron Paul has, you have.
[01:33:54.250 --> 01:34:04.306]  And anytime we've got a patriot who's really about to take, you know, a House seat or a Senate seat or a Statehouse seat, they're there attacking as well.
[01:34:06.513 --> 01:34:09.215]  But it's just like Democrat supporters of Obama.
[01:34:09.816 --> 01:34:17.843]  It doesn't matter how bad you get hurt, how many times you get lied to, you want to believe that the establishment cares about you and wants to take good care of you.
[01:34:18.384 --> 01:34:24.510]  What's happening is, they're having to admit world government exists but put their spin on it because it's out in the open.
[01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:27.332]  Because we should have great credibility right now.
[01:34:27.592 --> 01:34:28.793]  Because we told the truth.
[01:34:29.054 --> 01:34:30.335]  Because we got laughed at.
[01:34:30.855 --> 01:34:32.357]  Because we did it decades ago.
[01:34:36.069 --> 01:34:48.237]  But now you get some hokey people up there in fancy suits with fancy teleprompters, and they give you all this song and dance and spin it all together with a bunch of neocon icing, and people are like, I love Glenn Beck!
[01:34:48.557 --> 01:34:49.598]  He's gonna save me!
[01:34:49.858 --> 01:34:51.759]  He's got the Democrats attacking him!
[01:34:51.839 --> 01:34:53.240]  That means he must be good!
[01:34:57.002 --> 01:34:59.444]  When it's all part of the same master system.
[01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:02.040]  It doesn't matter.
[01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:03.240]  Look, you're going to win.
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:04.801]  You're probably going to get what you want.
[01:35:05.221 --> 01:35:07.101]  Things are just going to continue to deteriorate.
[01:35:07.121 --> 01:35:08.882]  They're going to continue to fall apart.
[01:35:09.062 --> 01:35:10.282]  They're going to get worse and worse.
[01:35:10.302 --> 01:35:15.603]  And we're going to be here in five, six years with the Republicans going, my God, how much worse is it going to get?
[01:35:15.863 --> 01:35:23.605]  And I'll have Democrats calling in going, you know, shouldn't we believe in filling the blank Democratic Party operative talk show host?
[01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:28.509]  And I'll be saying, no, you saw what happened with Obama and then with the Republicans.
[01:35:28.549 --> 01:35:29.630]  Don't let it happen again.
[01:35:29.650 --> 01:35:32.912]  And I'll have them sit there and tell me how I'm wrong, as usual.
[01:35:35.735 --> 01:35:37.056]  People love to get scammed.
[01:35:37.096 --> 01:35:37.756]  They enjoy it.
[01:35:39.017 --> 01:35:40.038]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[01:35:40.098 --> 01:35:41.119]  Delta in New York.
[01:35:41.159 --> 01:35:42.100]  You're on the air, Delta.
[01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:43.241]  Hi, Alex.
[01:35:43.541 --> 01:35:43.881]  Hi, buddy.
[01:35:44.742 --> 01:35:46.944]  Hey, I want to talk about the Federal Reserve, actually.
[01:35:48.425 --> 01:35:49.446]  Can you turn your radio off?
[01:35:49.466 --> 01:35:50.046]  That'd be wonderful.
[01:35:51.568 --> 01:35:51.888]  Hang on.
[01:35:53.143 --> 01:35:54.324]  Or I really won't be able to hear you.
[01:35:54.344 --> 01:35:55.725]  I'm actually, I'm an internet caller.
[01:35:55.765 --> 01:35:56.185]  Can you hear me?
[01:35:56.205 --> 01:35:58.868]  Hello?
[01:35:58.888 --> 01:36:00.929]  Yeah, there's just a lot of noise in the background, but go ahead.
[01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:09.936]  Okay, so, uh, I agree with Ron Paul, you know, about ending the Fed, but I heard you suggest putting it under Congress.
[01:36:10.697 --> 01:36:14.480]  So I'm just afraid that the Trojan horse, at the end of the day,
[01:36:15.728 --> 01:36:19.090]  Well, I mean, I'm just saying that's what the Constitution states.
[01:36:19.870 --> 01:36:29.415]  I mean, you know, right now, Congress isn't in control of the issuance of currency and credit, and when they go to the private Federal Reserve, they say, we're not going to tell you, Mac.
[01:36:30.195 --> 01:36:33.016]  So get lost, sucker, we runs this country now.
[01:36:33.337 --> 01:36:35.558]  You know, gangster talk.
[01:36:36.258 --> 01:36:37.338]  We're not going to tell you.
[01:36:37.358 --> 01:36:40.680]  And we run Glenn Beck and the Democrats.
[01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:44.302]  So, I mean, what do you suggest?
[01:36:45.444 --> 01:36:46.425]  I mean, it's a good question.
[01:36:46.445 --> 01:36:50.809]  I'm not sure myself, but I mean, Congress just does a terrible job with everything.
[01:36:51.629 --> 01:37:02.459]  So, and if you put it under Congress and have them just, you know, printing money for anything, I mean, that could be the Trojan horse that turns us into Zimbabwe.
[01:37:02.959 --> 01:37:06.182]  That could be what brings in the one world currency.
[01:37:07.455 --> 01:37:09.836]  Well, you always have that with a fiat currency.
[01:37:10.297 --> 01:37:11.497]  It's happened before in our history.
[01:37:11.517 --> 01:37:16.440]  Before we had the Federal Reserve System, we had some fiat-based currencies early on in the nation's history.
[01:37:17.161 --> 01:37:28.667]  And people can always overprint money up front, buy things with it, even though they know a few years down the road it's going to destroy much of the wealth that's been produced, they don't care.
[01:37:28.687 --> 01:37:31.329]  It's like a bank robber doesn't care as long as they get away with the money.
[01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:34.510]  Or a rapist rapes and kills a woman because they like it.
[01:37:34.811 --> 01:37:36.692]  They don't think of the woman as a human being.
[01:37:37.712 --> 01:38:06.078]  uh... but you have to get it away from the private bankers and under congress because that's what's in the bill of rights and constitution and then you have a public debate about the monetary system and you follow the constitution and with what it says about just weights and measures and that's a whole nother issue but but ron paul wants the issuance of currency and credit back under congress and he wants a gold backed
[01:38:06.618 --> 01:38:07.880]  I absolutely agree with that.
[01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:12.265]  I just think that maybe you need some kind of another independent group under government.
[01:38:23.191 --> 01:38:25.571]  Besides Congress that's doing it.
[01:38:25.712 --> 01:38:28.112]  Well, that's what the UN does and it's not independent.
[01:38:28.132 --> 01:38:30.032]  They call it non-governmental organizations.
[01:38:30.813 --> 01:38:34.673]  And then they claim that that group speaks for the people, not the people.
[01:38:35.173 --> 01:38:42.435]  Or that that group speaks for Congress and then now you've got this independent group over the independent group that you elect.
[01:38:42.475 --> 01:38:52.677]  Look, we've let a bunch of offshore banks come in and buy off both parties and so they do this tag team song and dance of when the Democrats are out of power, they're anti-establishment.
[01:38:53.834 --> 01:38:56.855]  And when the Republicans are out of power, they're anti-establishment.
[01:38:57.155 --> 01:38:58.495]  It's very elementary.
[01:38:58.995 --> 01:39:07.377]  And so we need to just agree on the Constitution and force them to follow it and make it illegal not to follow it.
[01:39:07.497 --> 01:39:15.079]  And it is illegal, by the way, but we have to enforce that so then they can't do what these offshore scallywags want them to do, Delta.
[01:39:15.319 --> 01:39:17.579]  It's very simple, but it's an interesting point you raise.
[01:39:17.919 --> 01:39:18.779]  I appreciate the call.
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:20.860]  Cory in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:39:22.654 --> 01:39:23.054]  Hello.
[01:39:23.494 --> 01:39:24.155]  Yes, Corey.
[01:39:25.095 --> 01:39:26.296]  Alex, what's going on?
[01:39:26.336 --> 01:39:27.077]  Big fan, man.
[01:39:27.377 --> 01:39:28.357]  Well, good to have you here, sir.
[01:39:28.397 --> 01:39:29.438]  Big fan of you, the listeners.
[01:39:29.458 --> 01:39:30.319]  What's on your mind today?
[01:39:31.179 --> 01:39:32.100]  I'm just wondering.
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:40.064]  You never really talk about Canada all that much in this New World Order plan, and I'm just like, I'm out here in the oil patch in Estevan, Saskatchewan.
[01:39:40.204 --> 01:39:41.665]  I'm originally from Toronto.
[01:39:41.765 --> 01:39:46.228]  I had to leave due to the lack of work when the so-called recession hit or whatever.
[01:39:46.969 --> 01:40:06.990]  Well, it hasn't really affected people out here, and there's a lot of infrastructure projects going on in this province, and I'm sure you heard about the big potash deal that's going on here, and I mean, Saskatchewan is really the future as far as people in Canada are concerned, or what they believe right now, and I'm just wondering, like, what's your take on our future up here?
[01:40:08.493 --> 01:40:13.714]  Well, Canada has passed some of the most draconian anti-free speech legislation in the world.
[01:40:14.454 --> 01:40:16.475]  They arrest preachers from reading from the Bible.
[01:40:17.635 --> 01:40:19.075]  It's openly owned by the Queen.
[01:40:19.135 --> 01:40:25.297]  Two years ago, when your Parliament tried to actually pass laws themselves, the Queen had Parliament dissolved.
[01:40:25.757 --> 01:40:27.377]  Her Governor General runs everything.
[01:40:28.077 --> 01:40:29.818]  And it's part of the propaganda that
[01:40:30.658 --> 01:40:32.159]  Canada is a Valhalla.
[01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:33.881]  It is a utopia.
[01:40:34.321 --> 01:40:35.622]  It is a heaven on earth.
[01:40:36.523 --> 01:40:45.031]  I know in several provinces your police chiefs tried to ban these semi-automatics and tried to confiscate them and the public ran them out of office.
[01:40:45.051 --> 01:40:45.972]  That's some good news.
[01:40:47.093 --> 01:40:49.315]  But Canada has some of the most draconian
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:51.220]  Laws.
[01:40:51.961 --> 01:40:56.423]  I've never been treated like I've been treated in Canada by your police.
[01:40:58.445 --> 01:41:12.113]  So, I know certain regions of Canada are doing better than other parts of the world, but the measure of the system you're under isn't just how much money you're making, it's how much freedom you've got.
[01:41:13.050 --> 01:41:14.591]  And it's how much liberty you've got.
[01:41:15.312 --> 01:41:21.136]  And Canada is really, the globalists have said in the last year, it is the model of world government.
[01:41:22.337 --> 01:41:24.859]  And so they make European immigration very hard.
[01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:28.462]  They make other immigration from anywhere else in the world very easy.
[01:41:28.502 --> 01:41:29.783]  They have a plan for Canada.
[01:41:30.764 --> 01:41:35.567]  And Canada is basically a New World Order model, similar to Communist China.
[01:41:35.627 --> 01:41:36.028]  Anything else?
[01:41:37.216 --> 01:41:38.918]  Wow, that's a scary thought, man.
[01:41:39.078 --> 01:41:39.839]  Honestly, yeah.
[01:41:39.859 --> 01:41:57.999]  See, I never thought of it like that, and I know a lot of people are really blinded up here, and I mean, I try and talk about you and spread the word, and I mean, there's a few people that are aware of you, but not very many people are, and the people that I do talk to don't buy into it because they have good jobs, and people are still making money here, and stuff's still moving, you know what I mean?
[01:41:58.968 --> 01:42:05.474]  I just wanted your perspective on Canada, because you kind of leave us out a lot, but like, you know, keep me informed, because I'm a listener, man.
[01:42:05.895 --> 01:42:07.937]  Well, I appreciate your call, Corey.
[01:42:07.977 --> 01:42:18.066]  We had two guests on from Canada last week, and we cover Canada almost every day, so I don't know how often you tune in, but there are over 190 countries worldwide, and it is
[01:42:22.597 --> 01:42:30.926]  Hard to cover them all, but almost every nation, there's less than 15 countries, really, if you count them up, that aren't under the globalist control.
[01:42:31.486 --> 01:42:34.790]  Now, the globalists dominate those nations.
[01:42:35.190 --> 01:42:39.314]  It doesn't mean that they control every facet of every part of your life.
[01:42:39.675 --> 01:42:44.780]  But that's what they want through globalism, is to expand that control.
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:43:00.107]  Okay, let's now go ahead and continue with some of the news before I go back to other callers that are patiently holding.
[01:43:00.547 --> 01:43:07.190]  Looking south from the United States, Mexican massacre investigator found dead.
[01:43:08.411 --> 01:43:15.075]  There are over 26,000 people, that's a conservative number, murdered in the last four and a half years in Mexico.
[01:43:17.258 --> 01:43:19.377]  And it is a fully collapsed society.
[01:43:21.184 --> 01:43:21.564]  Alex Jones Show!
[01:43:53.085 --> 01:43:53.765]  Monetize!
[01:43:54.626 --> 01:44:18.557]  And so they take the money from the immigrants, they grab Central, South American, Middle Eastern, Cuban, you name it, immigrants that make it to Mexico, and they demand a couple thousand dollars apiece when they catch them up at the Texas border, Mexico-Arizona border, with Mexico, the New Mexican border, the Californian border, other borders, with the United States,
[01:44:20.712 --> 01:44:21.673]  And this is on record.
[01:44:22.754 --> 01:44:26.797]  If you don't have the money in hand, they line you up and shoot you in the back of the head, including small children.
[01:44:27.977 --> 01:44:29.779]  And you don't hear La Raza or Mecha.
[01:44:31.428 --> 01:44:37.213]  Talk about that, because they are financed by the big tax-free foundations that run all of this.
[01:44:37.913 --> 01:44:41.616]  And I've talked to a lot of Mexicans from Mexico.
[01:44:41.636 --> 01:44:50.964]  I was at a family barbecue yesterday, and there was a fellow from San Diego who's Hispanic, who's from southern Mexico, but he's been here all his life.
[01:44:51.564 --> 01:44:54.406]  And he said, no, interior Mexicans know what's going on.
[01:44:55.703 --> 01:45:18.104]  uh... but he said that uh... talking to my dad actually i was listening he said that uh... mainly it's the mexicans in texas arizona and california who work with the mexican mafia and los zetas and he said and and and so even after they come to the u s they're used as slaves and he described
[01:45:20.407 --> 01:45:30.179]  Some folks that he knew who basically had come in from Mexico and who disappeared on the east side of Austin and are used as mules, as slaves.
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:36.687]  And what they do is they basically hold these Hispanic children and then they're used as slaves for decades.
[01:45:37.108 --> 01:45:38.730]  The Austin police don't go over there.
[01:45:40.163 --> 01:45:41.584]  CPS doesn't go over there.
[01:45:41.604 --> 01:45:51.571]  I mean, they're constantly, occasionally having busts where there'll be hundreds of women as sex slaves in houses and children and DynCorp and Halliburton are all involved.
[01:45:51.952 --> 01:45:55.554]  DynCorp runs the CPS, so they help run the slave kids out.
[01:45:56.095 --> 01:46:02.940]  Basically, I have to revise my analysis because I already knew this information, but he just crystallized it for me.
[01:46:06.721 --> 01:46:18.287]  Some illegal aliens are above the law, but only because they are property of the drug cartels and the CIA and the banks to be fed on, like T-bone steaks.
[01:46:19.527 --> 01:46:22.949]  And so local cops aren't allowed to touch the mafia's goods.
[01:46:24.429 --> 01:46:35.455]  And then I was talking to another family friend who was over there at my grandmother's birthday party, and my parents, who I've known for a long time, and she works for one of the largest apartment complexes.
[01:46:37.193 --> 01:46:44.880]  She had talked about how a few years ago they became secret government housing.
[01:46:46.161 --> 01:46:58.852]  That is, they're not supposed to tell their regular customers, but they are now 501c3, and that they are to give the illegal aliens, with no ID, apartments.
[01:47:00.681 --> 01:47:04.442]  And that the federal government is funding them to do this.
[01:47:04.902 --> 01:47:16.106]  And then she started agreeing with the Hispanic fellow who was at the birthday party about, yeah, she talked about a guy who works with her in the apartments.
[01:47:16.126 --> 01:47:17.026]  He's been here for years.
[01:47:17.726 --> 01:47:19.967]  And he's a legal guy from Cuba.
[01:47:20.407 --> 01:47:21.187]  And they got in this
[01:47:23.618 --> 01:47:34.108]  Little fishing boat with a motor, but halfway across the motor broke, so they tried to paddle to Florida, and the currents caught them and pushed them in to Central America, and so they had to make it all the way up.
[01:47:34.128 --> 01:47:45.699]  They were just a few miles from the Texas border, and the Los Zetas got them, and took them, and kept them for a few months until their family could secretly smuggle $2,000 apiece out to them.
[01:47:46.079 --> 01:47:47.420]  Then they still held them longer.
[01:47:48.624 --> 01:47:58.252]  Barely feeding them, like something out of the road, literally in an underground cellar.
[01:47:59.312 --> 01:48:08.780]  And then he and his Cuban buddy got across and the border patrol shook them down for money, both illegal money and then legal bond.
[01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:13.904]  And then once they were put in the jail cells, they never got their bond back.
[01:48:15.570 --> 01:48:16.731]  And they were Cuban.
[01:48:16.771 --> 01:48:19.454]  I mean, automatic refugee status to the U.S.
[01:48:19.494 --> 01:48:23.917]  And they should get it, because that is a horrible communist situation.
[01:48:25.138 --> 01:48:26.560]  And once they got here...
[01:48:28.609 --> 01:48:33.614]  Then the jail guard came to him and said, OK, you've got the money, so you're going to get out.
[01:48:33.894 --> 01:48:35.535]  But to your other Cuban buddy, you're not.
[01:48:35.796 --> 01:48:41.221]  But I have the drug cartel guy, who you already paid on the other side, his operatives out here.
[01:48:41.581 --> 01:48:46.605]  We're going to send you to Austin, and you're going to be a mule in East Austin.
[01:48:46.746 --> 01:48:52.030]  And the other Cuban guy, who's been several years, has never seen his buddy from Cuba again.
[01:48:52.932 --> 01:49:18.912]  So it's legalized slavery, and what everyone was agreeing on is that the Hispanic groups, the ones the media gives the attention, the ones that represent them, the ones that put out movies about, you know, the Hispanic hero that kills the evil gringos, those type of people, they are there to manage and racially control Hispanics because they're there to be shaken down.
[01:49:19.032 --> 01:49:21.895]  And I remember a former city council person, their brother,
[01:49:23.089 --> 01:49:28.854]  Got busted a few years ago as a coyote for having a bunch of Mexican slaves at his house.
[01:49:29.755 --> 01:49:31.476]  Because they, quote, couldn't pay him the money.
[01:49:31.496 --> 01:49:33.918]  Of course, they can never pay the money.
[01:49:35.139 --> 01:49:36.620]  It's just like the Chinese Mafia.
[01:49:37.041 --> 01:49:40.523]  The Chinese pay on average about $10,000 to be smuggled here in containers.
[01:49:41.064 --> 01:49:43.886]  But once they get here, they never get the money paid off.
[01:49:46.608 --> 01:49:48.230]  It's the same thing with the Russian Mafia.
[01:49:49.184 --> 01:50:09.620]  And so America's just completely mafia-run, and so it goes corporate chiefs, they have the supreme rights, then government bureaucrats and politicians, then cops, then illegal aliens, then citizens, and from my studies, below them, it's immigrants.
[01:50:11.314 --> 01:50:12.775]  And they are sex slaves.
[01:50:13.055 --> 01:50:14.096]  Organs are stolen.
[01:50:14.136 --> 01:50:15.217]  That's come out in the news.
[01:50:15.737 --> 01:50:16.858]  Their kids are taken.
[01:50:17.278 --> 01:50:18.960]  Just free reign on them.
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:20.541]  And that's what I mean.
[01:50:20.601 --> 01:50:23.263]  The truth is so much more complex than simple sound bites.
[01:50:23.363 --> 01:50:24.484]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:50:28.171 --> 01:50:52.039]  I mean, to read about how they got these women and kids in these dungeons, just like the movie The Road, and they're all running around and they're naked, starving to death, and these Los Zetas peoples funded by the CIA rape the women and children for pleasure and enjoyment, and then cut their heads off and stick them on poles, and then Mecha and La Raza are all in with these people, they're all Mexican Mafia run, and they all think it's cute and funny and cover up what they're doing to them,
[01:50:53.239 --> 01:50:56.141]  Instead, make it a distraction about stupid gringos?
[01:50:56.221 --> 01:50:59.083]  I mean, we're just completely screwed, I'm here to tell you.
[01:50:59.943 --> 01:51:00.404]  Attention!
[01:51:00.524 --> 01:51:05.426]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[01:51:05.527 --> 01:51:11.090]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes, and dramatically lowering amounts owed.
[01:51:11.210 --> 01:51:18.134]  Due to the financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[01:51:18.354 --> 01:51:27.779]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[01:51:28.079 --> 01:51:31.241]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[01:51:31.481 --> 01:51:38.105]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[01:51:38.305 --> 01:51:47.090]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[01:51:47.250 --> 01:51:51.912]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[01:51:51.932 --> 01:51:52.052]  800-902-6969.
[01:51:52.072 --> 01:51:52.212]  800-902-6969.
[01:51:52.252 --> 01:51:52.793]  Again, 800-902-6969.
[01:51:52.893 --> 01:51:54.193]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:54.293 --> 01:52:01.417]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:01.457 --> 01:52:02.637]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:11.663]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[01:52:12.043 --> 01:52:12.443]  It's true.
[01:52:12.524 --> 01:52:17.148]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:17.628 --> 01:52:22.333]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:22.853 --> 01:52:29.780]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[01:53:00.307 --> 01:53:03.229]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:53:03.309 --> 01:53:05.250]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:53:05.370 --> 01:53:08.031]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:53:08.132 --> 01:53:10.073]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?

[01:53:11.754 --> 01:53:13.635]  But first, the facts.
[01:53:13.655 --> 01:53:15.376]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:53:15.596 --> 01:53:17.317]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:53:17.577 --> 01:53:21.059]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.

[01:53:50.548 --> 01:53:50.908]  It works!
[01:54:03.154 --> 01:54:18.815]  Folks, it shakes me up to really learn that our government is involved laundering the money, not just from heroin, cocaine, and other drugs out of Mexico, and that Los Zetas works for the CIA.
[01:54:20.544 --> 01:54:26.787]  And is kidnapping men, women, children, raping them, murdering them, killing them en masse.
[01:54:27.207 --> 01:54:29.228]  Things far worse than any horror movie.
[01:54:29.628 --> 01:54:31.609]  Worse than Jim Jones every day.
[01:54:32.249 --> 01:54:34.050]  Literally Hitler level.
[01:54:35.811 --> 01:54:39.773]  And do you see Robert Rodriguez, the big director, the maker of Machete?
[01:54:40.816 --> 01:54:42.437]  Making a race war film about that?
[01:54:42.457 --> 01:54:51.746]  Do you see him making a film about the drug cartels controlling and dominating and controlling human trafficking?
[01:54:52.687 --> 01:54:52.887]  No.
[01:54:54.448 --> 01:55:00.013]  No, he makes a movie about a hero federale that comes to the United States to kill the Minutemen.
[01:55:00.433 --> 01:55:05.158]  The Minutemen do not have giant dungeons full of men, women, and children they're raping and killing.
[01:55:05.953 --> 01:55:07.394]  And it's all an act of dominance.
[01:55:07.434 --> 01:55:11.076]  The Los Zetas and others like to rape the men before they cut their heads off.
[01:55:11.296 --> 01:55:12.517]  They're just demon pigs.
[01:55:13.798 --> 01:55:15.359]  And now they're paying off your cops.
[01:55:15.379 --> 01:55:16.940]  Now they're taking over the Southwest.
[01:55:17.901 --> 01:55:20.863]  Now they're getting all the Democratic Party and Republican Party funding.
[01:55:22.304 --> 01:55:26.086]  Now they're intimidating the police, and our police are rolling over in a cowardly fashion.
[01:55:26.106 --> 01:55:27.887]  I mean, look at this.
[01:55:27.987 --> 01:55:30.249]  Mexican massacre investigator found dead.
[01:55:31.618 --> 01:55:37.343]  Body of official dumped beside road near scene of killing of 72 Central and South American migrants.
[01:55:38.884 --> 01:55:39.444]  Here's another one.
[01:55:39.504 --> 01:55:42.006]  Mayor of violent Mexican border state assassinated.
[01:55:42.527 --> 01:55:44.128]  That's a mayor every week they're killing.
[01:55:45.089 --> 01:55:47.130]  Two car bombs explode in northern Mexico.
[01:55:47.851 --> 01:55:50.573]  Hell, we got car bombings in Dallas and the media keeps it real quiet.
[01:55:51.174 --> 01:55:52.214]  Mexican cartels.
[01:55:53.243 --> 01:55:54.824]  Mexican sphere cartels are winning.
[01:55:55.604 --> 01:55:56.744]  Well, of course they're winning.
[01:55:56.784 --> 01:55:57.845]  It's all globalist run.
[01:55:58.185 --> 01:56:04.987]  Listen, it's come out that DynCorp and Halliburton run giant child kidnapping rings in the Chicago Tribune and congressional hearings.
[01:56:06.228 --> 01:56:10.009]  DynCorp runs the CPS in Texas and many other states.
[01:56:11.289 --> 01:56:13.110]  Who do you think comes and kidnaps your kid?
[01:56:13.150 --> 01:56:14.411]  It's a DynCorp operative!
[01:56:14.971 --> 01:56:15.751]  They rule!
[01:56:17.372 --> 01:56:18.292]  They run everything!
[01:56:19.841 --> 01:56:22.563]  You think they'll kill a million Iraqis and they don't care about you?
[01:56:23.383 --> 01:56:24.284]  They don't care about you.
[01:56:24.304 --> 01:56:26.425]  They don't care about anybody.
[01:56:26.645 --> 01:56:29.807]  And just as soon as they get your guns, they're gonna murder most of us.
[01:56:29.867 --> 01:56:31.248]  Okay, you understand that?
[01:56:31.548 --> 01:56:33.169]  We got crooks running everything.
[01:56:33.749 --> 01:56:38.192]  And if you think Glenn Beck's gonna save you, he didn't tell you 1-100 to how hardcore it is.
[01:56:41.774 --> 01:56:45.176]  Brewer condemns report to UN mentioning Arizona law.
[01:56:46.032 --> 01:56:48.834]  Let me tell you why they haven't started the wholesale killing here in the U.S.
[01:56:48.854 --> 01:56:50.456]  They haven't figured out how to sell it to you.
[01:56:50.716 --> 01:56:52.898]  They're afraid you might go wild with your guns.
[01:56:53.498 --> 01:56:57.081]  They want to wait until they've got their control grid in place so they can really start having their way with you.
[01:56:59.103 --> 01:57:03.246]  Meanwhile, Obama's sicking the United Nations on Arizona.
[01:57:04.928 --> 01:57:06.169]  Is he sicking the U.N.
[01:57:06.649 --> 01:57:12.074]  on Mexico with their paramilitary police running around kidnapping and murdering people en masse?
[01:57:12.094 --> 01:57:13.175]  Do you know anything about that?
[01:57:15.666 --> 01:57:18.147]  No, instead they're pulling the Border Patrol out of the border areas.
[01:57:18.668 --> 01:57:25.612]  And the 500 troops for Arizona and the 500 for Texas and the 200 for California aren't going to do diddly squat.
[01:57:25.892 --> 01:57:27.673]  It's all for imaging.
[01:57:28.173 --> 01:57:30.114]  It's all to sell you on how great it is.
[01:57:34.377 --> 01:57:36.138]  Man, I wish there was a free country to go to.
[01:57:37.415 --> 01:57:41.056]  There's all these fluoride heads, all these drooling idiots everywhere who don't know anything.
[01:57:41.577 --> 01:57:46.678]  Have no idea how much trouble we're in, how rotten everything is, how scum-filled the government is.
[01:57:46.718 --> 01:57:47.619]  You have no idea.
[01:57:47.979 --> 01:57:49.139]  Look at this article right here.
[01:57:49.459 --> 01:57:50.780]  I've had this since this morning.
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:55.222]  Several of these in my stack, and I can't even read this on air.
[01:57:55.702 --> 01:57:55.942]  Okay?
[01:57:57.162 --> 01:58:00.805]  Because I'm not some cynical yuppie that's just into winning personally.
[01:58:01.085 --> 01:58:02.446]  That means how much money I have.
[01:58:02.706 --> 01:58:05.328]  I'm a human being that recognizes the social engineering.
[01:58:05.609 --> 01:58:06.930]  And I know how much trouble we're in.
[01:58:07.290 --> 01:58:13.315]  Every week I see articles where they're making school children wear RFID chips in their clothing to track them.
[01:58:14.670 --> 01:58:15.591]  You know what this means?
[01:58:15.911 --> 01:58:20.575]  I'd tell you about this 10 years ago and get made fun of and told it's never gonna happen, it's never coming.
[01:58:20.835 --> 01:58:23.056]  Here it is, KSBW-TV.
[01:58:23.697 --> 01:58:26.559]  State officials say devices will save time and money.
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:31.163]  All children will wear RFID tracker chips.
[01:58:31.383 --> 01:58:32.524]  A $50,000 grant paid for it.
[01:58:33.264 --> 01:58:36.947]  And now I gotta watch all these sheep tell me it's about keeping the kids safe.
[01:58:36.987 --> 01:58:37.688]  Give me a break.
[01:58:43.143 --> 01:58:47.164]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:49.385 --> 01:58:51.005]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[01:59:13.358 --> 01:59:19.564]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[01:59:19.884 --> 01:59:21.266]  Buy American and stay clean.

[01:59:47.668 --> 01:59:48.108]  Thank you.
[01:59:52.391 --> 01:59:54.333]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.753 --> 01:59:57.555]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.437 --> 02:00:08.620]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.261 --> 02:00:10.081]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.842 --> 02:00:11.803]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.403 --> 02:00:16.026]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.586 --> 02:00:20.710]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.291 --> 02:00:26.574]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:26.614 --> 02:00:30.157]  Thank you for joining us on this Monday edition.
[02:00:30.197 --> 02:00:32.118]  Paul Watson's gonna be with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:00:32.879 --> 02:00:34.060]  And we're gonna open the phones up.
[02:00:38.854 --> 02:00:41.095]  I'm going to try to save some lives this hour.
[02:00:44.056 --> 02:00:45.137]  And I hope you're going to help me.
[02:00:48.999 --> 02:00:56.642]  But the more I research what's happening on the border, it's just wholesale lawlessness with whole families being slaughtered with pleasure.
[02:00:59.804 --> 02:01:03.526]  And I realize our country's rotten and decadent and evil, and it's all going to fall.
[02:01:04.420 --> 02:01:07.201]  And I guess at the end of the day, we deserve what we're gonna get.
[02:01:07.221 --> 02:01:07.761]  We're idiots.
[02:01:08.061 --> 02:01:08.721]  We're fools.
[02:01:09.141 --> 02:01:10.281]  We buy any scam.
[02:01:10.321 --> 02:01:10.802]  We love it.
[02:01:12.902 --> 02:01:14.402]  We love tyranny.
[02:01:14.742 --> 02:01:15.563]  We love abortions.
[02:01:15.603 --> 02:01:16.883]  We love 50 million dead babies.
[02:01:23.645 --> 02:01:24.945]  God, I just gotta get out of here.
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:32.482]  I just want away from Barack Obama and Glenn Beck and La Raza and Mecha and all of it.
[02:01:32.982 --> 02:01:34.703]  All the smiley face devils.
[02:01:35.163 --> 02:01:36.644]  I just can't look at them anymore.
[02:01:41.886 --> 02:01:43.586]  But I guess I should be more positive.
[02:01:48.268 --> 02:01:49.209]  We had record
[02:01:50.248 --> 02:01:58.712]  Numbers of people worldwide say no to the stinking eugenics injections that you know of as the flu shots.
[02:02:00.493 --> 02:02:02.434]  We had record numbers of people.
[02:02:04.354 --> 02:02:10.317]  But Bill and Melinda Gates are out coming out with all these pharmacological crops where it's going to be engineered into your food.
[02:02:10.697 --> 02:02:14.399]  They don't want you to escape it because they care so much about you.
[02:02:20.609 --> 02:02:23.189]  Kind of like somebody running a pig through a slaughterhouse.
[02:02:23.229 --> 02:02:24.130]  Shoot, cares about it.
[02:02:26.090 --> 02:02:27.170]  When they slit its throat.
[02:02:31.471 --> 02:02:35.792]  You know, it just dawns on me how real all this is and that it's worse than I even thought.
[02:02:44.353 --> 02:02:47.414]  And the sick thing about it is,
[02:02:49.870 --> 02:02:52.531]  Everybody gets judged, and I don't mean when you die.
[02:02:53.911 --> 02:02:58.873]  Oh, you atheists and yuppies and people don't think there's a God, don't think there's justice?
[02:02:58.893 --> 02:02:59.713]  Yeah, there is.
[02:03:01.053 --> 02:03:01.593]  Yeah, there is.
[02:03:04.714 --> 02:03:08.255]  You like putting your old folks in a nursing home and not visiting them?
[02:03:09.356 --> 02:03:10.476]  And letting them rot to death?
[02:03:10.516 --> 02:03:11.776]  You think euthanasia is cute?
[02:03:12.257 --> 02:03:13.397]  You're gonna get euthanized.
[02:03:15.097 --> 02:03:16.938]  You think it's cute not caring about your neighbor?
[02:03:17.619 --> 02:03:20.040]  You think it's cute laughing at corruption and tyranny?
[02:03:20.241 --> 02:03:21.361]  You're going to get run over.
[02:03:23.763 --> 02:03:25.764]  You're going to get hurt real bad.
[02:03:28.286 --> 02:03:33.930]  And Glenn Beck is going to get hurt real bad by the New World Order he serves.
[02:03:36.132 --> 02:03:38.093]  And all of you Democratic Party operatives.
[02:03:38.113 --> 02:03:41.896]  Keith Oberman is going to get hurt real bad by the system he serves.
[02:03:43.789 --> 02:03:44.870]  Me, I'm dead already.
[02:03:44.930 --> 02:03:47.432]  I don't even... I don't even care what happens to me.
[02:03:48.753 --> 02:03:52.536]  I know anybody ever touches anybody in my family, though, you're gonna pay.
[02:03:53.897 --> 02:03:55.619]  You better guarantee know that.
[02:03:56.179 --> 02:04:00.803]  Anything happens to me, I want you to find out I did it to my family, and I want my listeners to hunt them down.
[02:04:00.823 --> 02:04:04.366]  So you don't have to worry about that.
[02:04:04.406 --> 02:04:05.487]  I'm gonna haunt your ass.
[02:04:07.639 --> 02:04:09.741]  But at the end of the day, I could care less about myself.
[02:04:09.801 --> 02:04:13.723]  I've been so far down the rat hole, so far down the rabbit hole.
[02:04:14.124 --> 02:04:16.005]  I've been to hell and back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:16.265 --> 02:04:18.187]  I've looked inside these people's brains.
[02:04:18.787 --> 02:04:20.408]  I know what they're going to do before they do it.
[02:04:22.850 --> 02:04:26.513]  I know they get off on brain damaging tens of millions of children every year.
[02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:28.380]  I know they love it.
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:29.560]  I know the big U.S.
[02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:30.901]  banks laundering all the money.
[02:04:31.241 --> 02:04:37.562]  They're getting almost more money from the illegal aliens they shake down on both sides of the border than they're getting from all the drug money.
[02:04:37.582 --> 02:04:44.243]  Alright, Paul Watson's coming up.
[02:04:46.604 --> 02:04:51.544]  I am beside myself with cold rage today.
[02:04:53.125 --> 02:04:54.125]  I really can't describe it.
[02:04:59.346 --> 02:05:03.569]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:03.889 --> 02:05:04.170]  Number 1.
[02:05:04.810 --> 02:05:07.952]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:08.233 --> 02:05:08.793]  Number 2.
[02:05:09.093 --> 02:05:13.637]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:13.977 --> 02:05:14.437]  It's true.
[02:05:14.717 --> 02:05:19.281]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:19.601 --> 02:05:20.141]  Number 3.
[02:05:20.422 --> 02:05:23.704]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:24.004 --> 02:05:27.707]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:27.907 --> 02:05:28.468]  Number 4.
[02:05:28.708 --> 02:05:31.070]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:31.470 --> 02:05:34.854]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:35.154 --> 02:05:35.354]  Number 5.
[02:05:35.935 --> 02:05:39.858]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:40.078 --> 02:05:44.843]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:45.143 --> 02:05:49.165]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:49.305 --> 02:05:50.866]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:06:02.212 --> 02:06:05.774]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:06:06.014 --> 02:06:08.635]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:06:08.875 --> 02:06:13.878]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:14.259 --> 02:06:19.922]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.

[02:06:25.866 --> 02:06:30.149]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[02:06:30.409 --> 02:06:38.515]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[02:06:38.875 --> 02:06:40.716]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[02:06:41.097 --> 02:06:43.138]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.

[02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:04.120]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:08.242]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:08.342 --> 02:07:10.623]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:10.643 --> 02:07:16.085]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:16.505 --> 02:07:22.747]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:23.167 --> 02:07:28.710]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:29.130 --> 02:07:32.812]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:33.312 --> 02:07:37.334]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:37.614 --> 02:07:43.117]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:43.557 --> 02:07:46.518]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:47.119 --> 02:07:48.539]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:49.520]  It's here.
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:57.203]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:00.465 --> 02:08:06.047]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:08:06.507 --> 02:08:09.049]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:08:12.893 --> 02:08:16.336]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, hour number three.
[02:08:17.137 --> 02:08:19.259]  And we're going to try to do some good here today.
[02:08:20.060 --> 02:08:24.985]  Occasionally, the level and sophistication of evil really gets to me.
[02:08:26.046 --> 02:08:37.516]  And the hypocrisy to know that Hispanic groups, particularly in the United States, are partnered with the drug cartels and partnered with the coyotes.
[02:08:38.576 --> 02:08:56.218]  I constantly see city officials all over the Southwest involved in coyote and drug trafficking, literally helping to rob the Latin American, Central South American immigrants that are coming in and to see them all holy as thou.
[02:08:58.635 --> 02:09:23.696]  really distracting and diverting from their criminal operations by creating racial politics for their own political power and to know that the big mega banks are laundering that money and to know that Mexico is completely collapsed and is now collapsing the southwest and our country's going into a depression and I've got all this incredible
[02:09:25.421 --> 02:09:30.363]  Financial news I haven't even gotten to yet, and I'm overwhelmed is what's happening.
[02:09:32.864 --> 02:09:35.265]  It's so much worse than what I can even say!
[02:09:35.285 --> 02:09:50.692]  And then I watch these mainline Republicans co-opting the Liberty Movement, the Awakening the Big Brother, only so they can make fun of real researchers and limit the scale of people's realization of how much trouble we're in.
[02:09:52.369 --> 02:09:53.330]  I mean, look at this story.
[02:09:53.931 --> 02:09:57.895]  State officials say devices will save staff time and money.
[02:09:59.356 --> 02:10:04.182]  California officials are outfitting preschoolers in Contra Costa County.
[02:10:05.609 --> 02:10:08.993]  With tracking devices, they said we'll save time and money.
[02:10:09.433 --> 02:10:11.195]  The system was introduced Tuesday.
[02:10:11.916 --> 02:10:16.702]  When at the school, students will wear a jersey that has a small radio frequency tag.
[02:10:16.722 --> 02:10:18.344]  We reported this two weeks ago, but here it is.
[02:10:18.804 --> 02:10:24.951]  The tag will send signals to sensors that will keep track of children's whereabouts, attendance and even
[02:10:25.652 --> 02:10:26.793]  Whether they've eaten or not.
[02:10:26.873 --> 02:10:29.295]  Yeah, everything you eat will be put on the tracking bracelet.
[02:10:29.795 --> 02:10:33.178]  And then if your mommy didn't send the right amount of food, the child will be taken.
[02:10:33.438 --> 02:10:34.619]  That was planned a long time ago.
[02:10:35.099 --> 02:10:42.885]  School officials say it will free up teachers and administrators who previously had to note on paper files when a child was absent or had eaten.
[02:10:43.545 --> 02:10:44.026]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:10:44.346 --> 02:10:48.489]  Just like people can't use regular arithmetic now with a pencil.
[02:10:48.509 --> 02:10:49.510]  They have to have a calculator.
[02:10:50.470 --> 02:10:51.371]  People can't think.
[02:10:51.491 --> 02:10:53.733]  So now, it's just going to be electronic prisons.
[02:10:55.319 --> 02:10:56.680]  And the kids will be brought up into this.
[02:10:57.781 --> 02:10:59.963]  School officials say it will free up teachers and administrators.
[02:11:02.124 --> 02:11:10.091]  Sung Kim of the county's Employment and Human Resources Department said the system could save thousands of hours of staff time and pay for itself within a year.
[02:11:10.651 --> 02:11:13.634]  It costs $50,000 and was paid for by a federal grant.
[02:11:14.014 --> 02:11:15.916]  It tracks the kids everywhere they are in real time.
[02:11:16.196 --> 02:11:18.017]  And your cell phones already do that as well.
[02:11:18.338 --> 02:11:19.939]  Just this is the total prison system.
[02:11:23.772 --> 02:11:52.331]  Now I want to get into this first with Paul Joseph Watson today and again I want to encourage listeners to get this information out to everyone they know because we were able
[02:11:56.092 --> 02:12:05.040]  Thanks to your action to get the vaccine inserts, actually what came with the vaccine, not what the nightly news said.
[02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:06.061]  There's no mercury.
[02:12:06.441 --> 02:12:07.242]  It's nutritious.
[02:12:07.623 --> 02:12:08.804]  There's no health problems.
[02:12:09.584 --> 02:12:11.906]  There is mercury, but it helps your child's brain.
[02:12:11.926 --> 02:12:12.927]  I mean, this was all in the news.
[02:12:13.548 --> 02:12:16.390]  We were able to get millions of people to read the insert.
[02:12:17.335 --> 02:12:18.836]  And I did YouTube videos on it.
[02:12:19.457 --> 02:12:20.617]  They got millions of views.
[02:12:21.398 --> 02:12:23.379]  And many other people have gone public since then.
[02:12:23.419 --> 02:12:28.643]  The British Medical Journal, the head of the EU Commission, Wolfgang Wudarg, the doctors and others.
[02:12:32.646 --> 02:12:37.410]  Conclusively proving that the vaccines
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:47.042]  Not just the H1N1, but the polio shots, all of it, are tainted by design to cause serious neurological disorders.
[02:12:48.562 --> 02:13:04.827]  Guillain-Barre, MS, narcolepsy, chronic brain inflammation, chronic convulsions, epilepsy, hundreds of neurological disorders.
[02:13:07.808 --> 02:13:08.468]  Lou Gehrig's,
[02:13:11.459 --> 02:13:14.100]  They have different names for different types of neurological disorders.
[02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:16.921]  We've had brain surgeons, scientists on to break down.
[02:13:16.961 --> 02:13:18.221]  This is the main cause.
[02:13:18.541 --> 02:13:21.522]  The sodium fluoride helps, the MSG helps, the mercury helps.
[02:13:25.843 --> 02:13:28.244]  But you see neurological disorders off the charts.
[02:13:28.284 --> 02:13:30.244]  You see young people getting Alzheimer's now.
[02:13:30.804 --> 02:13:32.305]  You know, we're talking 20, 30 years old.
[02:13:32.345 --> 02:13:35.926]  We see more and more people getting Parkinson's.
[02:13:38.107 --> 02:13:39.407]  And it's all by design.
[02:13:40.814 --> 02:13:42.154]  And you're going to have to face that horror.
[02:13:43.415 --> 02:13:44.795]  This is all about facing horror.
[02:13:51.338 --> 02:13:58.360]  Now, they're back this year mixing the deadly H1N1 with the regular seasonal flu shot.
[02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:02.161]  And here's the most important message that I can give you today.
[02:14:03.042 --> 02:14:03.542]  And it's this.
[02:14:06.379 --> 02:14:23.766]  Last week we had several articles at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com documenting the fact from the Rockefeller Foundation itself, this is them saying it about themselves, that they developed things to be added to vaccines to quietly sterilize you or reduce fertility.
[02:14:24.066 --> 02:14:29.128]  It can't sterilize everybody or it's too noticeable, so it's soft kill, it's degenerative,
[02:14:30.571 --> 02:14:33.599]  And we have, of course, countless other U.N., U.S.
[02:14:33.639 --> 02:14:37.230]  government documents, Club of Rome, talking about it being done with other vaccines.
[02:14:38.686 --> 02:14:51.593]  Clearly, the violent responses from Gardasil, H1N1 and others, scientists and private firms have done tests and found a lot of RNA and other chemicals and things that have been added to those.
[02:14:52.093 --> 02:14:55.235]  And you notice they said, we want pregnant women particularly to take this.
[02:14:55.815 --> 02:15:05.000]  We know with previous research that it massively increases brain damage in the fetuses, in the women, causes miscarriages, low birth rates, that's now
[02:15:06.434 --> 02:15:11.756]  In the British Medical Journal, London Telegraph, AP Reuters, but still they don't care.
[02:15:11.796 --> 02:15:17.398]  They're brazenly coming out, pushing that everybody has got to take these shots and take them now.
[02:15:18.679 --> 02:15:20.600]  And this isn't a radio show.
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:22.701]  This isn't about your entertainment.
[02:15:23.541 --> 02:15:23.861]  Okay?
[02:15:24.381 --> 02:15:26.202]  This is about a war against tyranny.
[02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:36.302]  And the costs are so great.
[02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:47.096]  And so we all have a responsibility, and I'm going to create some flyers, and I'm going to get them up.
[02:15:47.176 --> 02:15:48.037]  Hell, we made a bunch.
[02:15:48.077 --> 02:15:48.838]  We made them a year ago.
[02:15:48.878 --> 02:15:49.639]  We never posted them.
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:51.762]  I'm going to go find out during a break why.
[02:15:53.049 --> 02:16:04.601]  But we're going to post a whole bunch of different flyers if you want to make flyers that simply and succinctly expose the flu shots as deadly and have links at the bottom into the mainstream news that admitted it.
[02:16:05.222 --> 02:16:08.405]  We'll post them on InfoWars and Prison Planet and hopefully get them out to everybody.
[02:16:09.226 --> 02:16:10.508]  But we have a chance.
[02:16:13.939 --> 02:16:30.655]  to reach out even more this year and save young people and their mothers and their fathers from injecting them through fear at the media hypes with these flu shots that A, don't protect them from the flu and B, are deadly and we know they're adding other junk to it.
[02:16:32.256 --> 02:16:35.699]  Vaccine deaths and injuries skyrocket as cover-up implodes.
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:38.022]  That's Paul Joseph Watson's article
[02:16:39.525 --> 02:16:44.711]  And I'm asking you to get his article from PrisonPlanet.com and get it out to everyone you know.
[02:16:47.193 --> 02:16:55.082]  And I'm asking you to make the number one search term today, last week you were successful again, vaccine deaths.
[02:16:56.483 --> 02:16:58.926]  And then when folks go out and
[02:17:01.226 --> 02:17:03.067]  Wonder what vaccine deaths is about.
[02:17:03.427 --> 02:17:11.010]  The number one link story on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com will be vaccine deaths.
[02:17:13.191 --> 02:17:22.495]  Vaccine deaths and injuries skyrocket as cover-up implodes and this goes over England, Finland, India,
[02:17:23.442 --> 02:17:28.706]  Where they're all coming out and saying these shots are causing death, brain damage, miscarriages.
[02:17:28.826 --> 02:17:30.027]  It's what it does.
[02:17:30.768 --> 02:17:34.851]  Okay, I know you find it hard to believe, but the stinking inserts say that.
[02:17:36.373 --> 02:17:40.596]  Have you seen the drug ads on TV for Prozac or you name it?
[02:17:40.636 --> 02:17:45.660]  It's like, may cause a heart attack, may cause you to die, may cause you to be impotent.
[02:17:47.580 --> 02:17:49.280]  It's like saying, got a hangnail?
[02:17:49.340 --> 02:17:51.181]  Shoot yourself in the head five times!
[02:17:51.641 --> 02:17:55.942]  They just put this out in the open, and the vampire asked permission to be let in.
[02:17:56.522 --> 02:17:57.582]  It's like Lindsay Lohan.
[02:17:57.902 --> 02:18:01.023]  Her own doctors admitted she was out of her mind on five or six different drugs.
[02:18:01.883 --> 02:18:08.665]  Vaccine deaths is the search today, but more than just that, get the article, send it out to everyone you know.
[02:18:08.685 --> 02:18:13.306]  We're going to go over the fact that the vaccine cover-up is imploding.
[02:18:15.356 --> 02:18:16.737]  Well, it's good to be back.
[02:18:35.731 --> 02:18:45.239]  Yeah, I mean it's the revolt, the global revolt against unsafe and dangerous vaccinations is gathering pace.
[02:18:45.279 --> 02:18:58.209]  There was a Rasmussen poll last week which found that 52% of Americans now were concerned about the safety of vaccines and that's way up on anything we've seen before.
[02:18:58.690 --> 02:19:02.933]  For many years, you know, people who were concerned about vaccines were sidelined as
[02:19:03.894 --> 02:19:23.607]  Kooks, but now the majority of American citizens share these same concerns, which is why the pharmaceutical companies are in trouble and it's why the government is paying for these PR firms to be set up that propagandize about how safe these vaccinations are.
[02:19:24.588 --> 02:19:33.474]  It's why you have people on the network news stations saying, trust the government and get your damn vaccine because they're in trouble.
[02:19:34.054 --> 02:19:53.467]  I mean, as a result of the swine flu hoax being exposed, not only after, with the EU report, but, you know, during the time when the pandemic was unfolding, you had levels in countries like France and Germany of only 6% of the population taking the swine flu vaccine.
[02:19:53.507 --> 02:19:57.150]  Your article is life-saving info, we've got a responsibility to get it out.
[02:19:57.530 --> 02:19:58.631]  Stay there, it's all coming up.
[02:20:00.026 --> 02:20:02.388]  Is your debt problem a ticking time bomb?
[02:20:02.628 --> 02:20:11.293]  Thanks to a new financial consumer relief program designed in response to the economic crisis facing millions of Americans, you don't have to wait until it's too late to defuse your debt.
[02:20:11.453 --> 02:20:23.741]  If you owe $10,000 or more in credit card bills and are struggling to make minimum payments, get ready to take down this number for free information that could potentially save your home, the lifestyle you're accustomed to, and your family's financial well-being.
[02:20:23.921 --> 02:20:24.602]  But don't wait!
[02:20:24.822 --> 02:20:27.804]  Studies show that if most debt problems are confronted directly,
[02:20:28.004 --> 02:20:28.384]  I think so.
[02:20:45.063 --> 02:20:47.507]  You must have $10,000 in credit card debt.
[02:20:47.587 --> 02:20:49.450]  Call the American Debt Associates at 800-876-2966.
[02:20:49.470 --> 02:20:49.550]  800-876-2966.
[02:20:49.570 --> 02:20:49.750]  Again, 800-876-2966.
[02:21:01.124 --> 02:21:06.845]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.

[02:21:59.724 --> 02:22:08.811]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:22:08.951 --> 02:22:12.294]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[02:22:12.494 --> 02:22:21.942]  In producing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[02:22:22.102 --> 02:22:27.346]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[02:22:27.626 --> 02:22:29.788]  Off the Grid News is fiercely independent.
[02:22:30.109 --> 02:22:40.960]  All about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns.

[02:22:59.918 --> 02:23:00.398]  Attention.
[02:23:00.518 --> 02:23:05.423]  This is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS.
[02:23:05.523 --> 02:23:12.869]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed due to the financial crisis in America.
[02:23:13.049 --> 02:23:18.133]  The IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy.
[02:23:18.333 --> 02:23:27.500]  If you owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been established by American Tax Settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75%.
[02:23:28.060 --> 02:23:31.223]  Number to call is 800-902-6969.
[02:23:31.463 --> 02:23:38.048]  Again, the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline in today's economy.
[02:23:38.268 --> 02:23:47.096]  If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up to 75% and save thousands of dollars.
[02:23:47.236 --> 02:23:51.881]  For free information and to see if you qualify, call the open phone line into American Tax Settlement now.
[02:23:51.901 --> 02:23:51.941]  800-902-6969.
[02:23:51.961 --> 02:23:52.061]  800-902-6969.
[02:23:52.081 --> 02:23:52.241]  Again, 800-902-6969.
[02:24:17.788 --> 02:24:27.615]  I mean, we're not supposed to be having fun doing this.
[02:24:27.675 --> 02:24:30.277]  It's not supposed to be cutesy talk show host crap.
[02:24:31.177 --> 02:24:36.761]  Our whole country and the whole world's being swallowed by tyranny because people are soft and stupid.
[02:24:37.522 --> 02:24:43.386]  And we have all the government documents where they're spiking our food and water with poisons to give us cancer and sterilize us.
[02:24:45.270 --> 02:24:48.431]  Now, we saved a lot of people exposing the flu last year.
[02:24:48.951 --> 02:24:51.531]  And they're out there in the media trying to brazenly push it.
[02:24:51.771 --> 02:24:54.512]  But we're very close to exposing these people.
[02:24:54.532 --> 02:25:00.713]  And then they're going to release biological plagues, and give you the cure, and grandstand as heroes.
[02:25:00.773 --> 02:25:03.414]  It's how these murdering control freaks work.
[02:25:03.954 --> 02:25:04.994]  It's how they operate.
[02:25:06.134 --> 02:25:08.495]  But the good news is, we're going to defeat them.
[02:25:08.715 --> 02:25:14.856]  And then we're going to take our governments back, and then we're going to get all the globalist documents, and we're going to take them and we're going to put them in prison.
[02:25:16.303 --> 02:25:17.824]  After a jury finds them guilty.
[02:25:18.464 --> 02:25:21.605]  And those that are found guilty of murder are going to be executed.
[02:25:22.225 --> 02:25:27.167]  I'm sick of you brain damaging kids and snickering with your control freak fake liberal garbage.
[02:25:27.387 --> 02:25:29.068]  You're a bunch of eugenics murderers.
[02:25:29.408 --> 02:25:33.069]  If you can't abort a baby in the womb, you'll kill them when they're 25.
[02:25:33.329 --> 02:25:34.650]  I know who you are, scum.
[02:25:34.870 --> 02:25:36.530]  I know you get off on murder and death.
[02:25:37.491 --> 02:25:38.251]  I understand it.
[02:25:38.271 --> 02:25:41.352]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:25:44.198 --> 02:25:45.118]  Watson, continue.
[02:25:45.138 --> 02:25:49.600]  You've got this article, vaccine deaths and injuries skyrocket as cover-up implodes.
[02:25:50.020 --> 02:25:51.981]  All over the world, they're suspending the shots.
[02:25:52.601 --> 02:25:56.283]  All over the world, the Rockefeller Foundation documents are coming out.
[02:25:56.343 --> 02:26:01.805]  As the public is willing to face the horror, we're gonna bring these murderers to justice.
[02:26:04.482 --> 02:26:11.712]  Well that's right, and this article lists just the recent cases that have been in the news.
[02:26:11.772 --> 02:26:17.720]  I mean, to list every single case of vaccine injury and death in each country would literally take an entire day.
[02:26:18.221 --> 02:26:20.364]  But the most recent one comes from India.
[02:26:22.246 --> 02:26:25.028]  And this has appeared in numerous Indian newspapers.
[02:26:25.508 --> 02:26:29.851]  And it was a measles vaccination program in an Indian village.
[02:26:30.911 --> 02:26:35.094]  They gave the children this vaccine, the babies in fact they were.
[02:26:35.114 --> 02:26:48.582]  And instantly, almost instantly after a minute of receiving this vaccine, the babies started to convulse, they started to foam from the mouth, they started to collapse.
[02:26:52.025 --> 02:26:52.566]  They died.
[02:26:52.666 --> 02:26:56.454]  Four children in India died directly as a result of this vaccine.
[02:26:58.447 --> 02:27:04.151]  The people of the village reacted by basically going on a rampage.
[02:27:04.531 --> 02:27:08.073]  They abducted the health workers and the government doctors.
[02:27:08.494 --> 02:27:14.618]  They held the government doctors hostage and they were eventually forced by the police to release them.
[02:27:14.698 --> 02:27:17.580]  And that's because they hadn't been drinking sodium fluoride from birth.
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:20.942]  That's why Americans used to be trying to take their kid for no reason would fight back.
[02:27:21.202 --> 02:27:28.107]  They submit because their IQ is upwards of 20 points lower and they're servile with chemical lobotomies.
[02:27:30.508 --> 02:27:31.029]  Exactly.
[02:27:31.869 --> 02:27:42.957]  But now even in the UK, you've got the MMR shot, which for the first time, lawsuits are now admitting that it caused the damage that we now see.
[02:27:43.177 --> 02:27:49.441]  You know, 18 years after these babies had this shot, they're now teenagers in wheelchairs that can hardly talk.
[02:27:49.981 --> 02:28:04.664]  And I see these people almost every time I go out somewhere, you see children in wheelchairs, they've got autism, babies, you know, 18-year-old teenagers, and now they're having to pay out compensation to these people.
[02:28:04.684 --> 02:28:17.806]  That's right, they're a year and a half old, running, giggling in their little onesie, having fun, and the doctors are just like, and the child blood runs out their nose at night, and they're just like, we ruined another one!
[02:28:18.306 --> 02:28:18.766]  Awesome!
[02:28:19.466 --> 02:28:21.009]  Give everybody more Prozac!
[02:28:21.049 --> 02:28:21.810]  More fluoride!
[02:28:21.850 --> 02:28:22.911]  Everybody's dying!
[02:28:22.972 --> 02:28:24.093]  Yeah!
[02:28:24.534 --> 02:28:25.095]  Yeah!
[02:28:25.155 --> 02:28:26.096]  It's fun!
[02:28:26.197 --> 02:28:27.278]  Ha ha ha!
[02:28:27.338 --> 02:28:28.119]  Yeah!
[02:28:28.139 --> 02:28:28.861]  Woo!
[02:28:29.482 --> 02:28:29.882]  I'm sorry.
[02:28:29.942 --> 02:28:30.663]  Watson, go ahead.
[02:28:32.216 --> 02:28:35.558]  Well, yeah, and it's not just the pharmaceutical companies that are to blame.
[02:28:36.558 --> 02:28:55.589]  For example, in Finland, which you mentioned before, where they had a 300% increase in narcolepsy, which is a neurological disorder, it turned out that the doctors knew that this was happening, but because it advanced their careers and they were paid off, just like with the swine flu... No, they love it, they enjoy it!
[02:28:56.189 --> 02:28:57.431]  Yeah, they love it.
[02:28:57.511 --> 02:28:59.433]  None of them take it?
[02:28:59.513 --> 02:28:59.934]  I'm learning.
[02:28:59.974 --> 02:29:03.698]  More and more of these yuppies just giggle and go, there are too many people.
[02:29:03.738 --> 02:29:04.759]  And I'm like, that's right.
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:06.762]  And now it's time to cut your head off.
[02:29:08.339 --> 02:29:10.040]  No, they're all eugenicists.
[02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:16.664]  A lot of people would support sterilizing people through vaccines because that's how they've been brainwashed into accepting it.
[02:29:17.665 --> 02:29:25.149]  But, yeah, so a 300% increase in Finland and Sweden of this neurological disorder, narcolepsy.
[02:29:25.169 --> 02:29:25.870]  Mission completed!
[02:29:25.890 --> 02:29:26.850]  They'll get more funding.
[02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:27.751]  Excellent job!
[02:29:28.968 --> 02:29:35.370]  Which, if you've ever been around anyone with narcolepsy, you know, it says, oh, falling asleep involuntarily.
[02:29:35.411 --> 02:29:36.611]  Well, it's a horrible disease.
[02:29:36.671 --> 02:29:38.012]  It ruins your entire life.
[02:29:38.032 --> 02:29:38.892]  They love that, though.
[02:29:38.912 --> 02:29:40.352]  Then that makes you a ward of the state.
[02:29:40.693 --> 02:29:43.994]  Then they can get you in queue for the soft killing to begin.
[02:29:44.434 --> 02:29:45.274]  Stay there, Watson.
[02:29:45.314 --> 02:29:46.015]  We'll continue.
[02:29:49.976 --> 02:29:50.877]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.377 --> 02:29:52.997]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.918 --> 02:29:56.599]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.148 --> 02:30:14.589]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:30:15.615 --> 02:30:19.318]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:20.318 --> 02:30:32.287]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:30:33.067 --> 02:30:40.350]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:50.594]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lung System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lung System works.

[02:31:58.769 --> 02:32:02.992]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:03.312 --> 02:32:03.592]  Number 1.
[02:32:04.232 --> 02:32:07.374]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:07.655 --> 02:32:08.215]  Number 2.
[02:32:08.515 --> 02:32:13.078]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:13.398 --> 02:32:13.859]  It's true.
[02:32:14.159 --> 02:32:18.702]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:19.022 --> 02:32:19.562]  Number 3.
[02:32:19.842 --> 02:32:23.124]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:23.425 --> 02:32:27.127]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:27.327 --> 02:32:27.887]  Number 4.
[02:32:28.128 --> 02:32:30.489]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:30.890 --> 02:32:34.272]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:34.573 --> 02:32:34.773]  Number 5.
[02:32:35.353 --> 02:32:39.276]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:39.516 --> 02:32:44.260]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:33:14.680 --> 02:33:17.861]  See, ladies and gentlemen, I'm kind of a throwback, like a caveman.
[02:33:19.401 --> 02:33:39.527]  If I start reading hundreds of government documents and corporate documents where they openly talk about how they're drugging the food and water supply to dumb me down, make me more manageable, reduce my fertility, and then I sit there and look at my children every morning and every evening, sweet and good and innocent, I start feeling very violent.
[02:33:41.007 --> 02:33:51.773]  And I start getting outraged, and then I control myself day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, knowing a bunch of murdering scum are running the system.
[02:33:54.475 --> 02:33:55.755]  And I get more and more tired of it.
[02:33:56.296 --> 02:34:00.318]  And so I try to get up here and read the insert of what's in the vaccines.
[02:34:01.799 --> 02:34:04.560]  See, some people say, well, vaccines are wonder drugs.
[02:34:04.600 --> 02:34:05.861]  Vaccines have saved millions.
[02:34:06.281 --> 02:34:07.322]  Well, number one, that's a lie.
[02:34:08.763 --> 02:34:09.263]  That's a lot.
[02:34:10.004 --> 02:34:28.472]  If you look at the advent of hygiene in the Western world, from Australia to Europe to the United States, around the 1920s, massive increases in hygiene and indoor running water went in, and less insects in the house, bed bugs, all that kind of stuff that the third world has.
[02:34:28.852 --> 02:34:35.095]  We got rid of it, and you see a massive decrease in many of the airborne diseases.
[02:34:37.273 --> 02:34:37.573]  Okay?
[02:34:37.853 --> 02:34:38.974]  You can go look at these statistics.
[02:34:39.614 --> 02:34:55.599]  Then, by the 40s, vaccines come in, and we actually see, into the 20s, disease goes down, the graphs are the same in every industrialized country, it goes down, disease goes down, vaccines come back in the 40s and 50s, and disease actually goes back up a little.
[02:34:56.679 --> 02:34:57.900]  Nothing compared to where it was.
[02:35:01.917 --> 02:35:07.320]  So, I'm not saying that in the science of vaccines there couldn't be some good.
[02:35:10.442 --> 02:35:19.868]  I'm not saying there isn't something to the science of you give somebody a little of a virus or a bacteria and then the body learns how to get an immunity to it.
[02:35:21.894 --> 02:35:31.882]  Okay, that's like putting somebody when they're 10 years old in a boxing ring once a week, you know, at Golden Gloves or something, and by the time they've been in it five years, you know, they know how to stand up for themselves.
[02:35:33.063 --> 02:35:39.288]  Instead of them just being thrown into a real fight in the street the first time and getting their, you know, their nose broken and their teeth knocked out.
[02:35:41.121 --> 02:35:49.727]  But you cannot trust this scientific establishment to push these shots because they've shown they don't care what's in them or how contaminated they are.
[02:35:50.007 --> 02:35:51.088]  In fact, it's worse than that.
[02:35:51.368 --> 02:36:02.416]  They knowingly contaminate them, whether it's weaponized bird flu mixed in with the regular flu shots, mainstream news, or high levels of mercury, or cancer viruses.
[02:36:02.736 --> 02:36:03.857]  They're killing you!
[02:36:04.337 --> 02:36:08.400]  Now Watson, I'm going to try to shut up because I've got other subjects I want to get into with you, but
[02:36:09.653 --> 02:36:10.693]  This is so outrageous.
[02:36:10.993 --> 02:36:13.134]  Start going through the article that you and I put together.
[02:36:13.454 --> 02:36:17.275]  Vaccine deaths and injuries skyrocket as cover-up implodes.
[02:36:17.795 --> 02:36:20.776]  Walk through that for people right now.
[02:36:22.877 --> 02:36:31.439]  Well, the first example is the one I mentioned before the break, which is the Indian children received a measles shot, instantly died.
[02:36:31.719 --> 02:36:34.560]  The villagers went on a rampage, abducted the doctors.
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:37.021]  The police managed to calm them down.
[02:36:37.841 --> 02:36:45.664]  So that's, that's a... Now see, here when your kid dies, the police come and arrest you and say that you beat their brains out because they've got blood on the brain.
[02:36:46.144 --> 02:36:52.886]  And it turns out they knew all along, the doctors, that it was a autoimmune inflammation response, but they don't care.
[02:36:53.146 --> 02:36:57.288]  So they don't just murder your kid or brain damage him, then they get your other kids.
[02:36:57.548 --> 02:37:00.189]  So see, here in America they've got the psych warfare down.
[02:37:00.449 --> 02:37:04.030]  They blame it on the mom and dad when they savage the child.
[02:37:04.930 --> 02:37:08.893]  Oh, see, they haven't learned how to murder their children properly in India.
[02:37:08.933 --> 02:37:09.873]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:37:12.095 --> 02:37:23.723]  Right, and then the second example is the 300% increase in narcolepsy in Finland and Sweden, which came as a result of the swine flu shot being given to children.
[02:37:23.903 --> 02:37:28.346]  As a result of that, they've suspended all swine flu shots in Finland and Sweden.
[02:37:28.926 --> 02:37:31.427]  Americans are going to get it in their seasonal flu shot.
[02:37:31.567 --> 02:37:32.408]  Don't worry about that.
[02:37:33.068 --> 02:37:36.890]  And then there is the swine flu hoax as a whole.
[02:37:38.090 --> 02:37:48.415]  Wolfgog Wudang, the EU investigation, proved that it was completely contrived, concocted between the pharmaceutical companies and the World Health Organization.
[02:37:48.755 --> 02:37:49.876]  They knew it was a scam.
[02:37:50.336 --> 02:37:51.337]  It was to make money.
[02:37:51.517 --> 02:37:57.324]  The pharmaceutical companies sold all the vaccines to the governments, which you paid for with your tax money.
[02:37:57.684 --> 02:38:03.931]  There's still batches of them piled up everywhere, because half or more of the people refused to take it.
[02:38:04.011 --> 02:38:06.334]  So now they're going to put it in your seasonal flu shot.
[02:38:08.706 --> 02:38:10.828]  Then we have the case of Poland.
[02:38:11.288 --> 02:38:21.595]  The only sovereign state in the entire world to refuse the swine flu shot completely was Poland, through their Prime Minister and their Health Minister.
[02:38:22.136 --> 02:38:23.657]  Why did they refuse the shot?
[02:38:23.717 --> 02:38:32.043]  Because just a year before, they had had a trial for a bird flu vaccine on homeless people, which killed 21 of them.
[02:38:33.504 --> 02:38:36.646]  So, instantly they threw it out.
[02:38:36.686 --> 02:38:39.507]  That was 21 out of one homeless center that was injected.
[02:38:39.547 --> 02:38:40.287]  It was actually much higher.
[02:38:40.307 --> 02:38:41.448]  Out of one center, yeah.
[02:38:42.068 --> 02:38:43.389]  So, Poland rejected it.
[02:38:43.409 --> 02:38:44.829]  The Czech Republic rejected it.
[02:38:44.869 --> 02:38:46.030]  But why are they upset?
[02:38:46.170 --> 02:38:47.731]  Murdering people is loving!
[02:38:48.835 --> 02:39:00.063]  Again, this medical tyranny, instead of Nazis putting you in a pit and shooting you, they shoot you with soft kill shots and like, shut up, kook, take it, haha, don't get mad, I'm your government.
[02:39:00.123 --> 02:39:02.825]  I mean, get away from us, you murdering scum!
[02:39:03.606 --> 02:39:08.189]  I see you, I know who you are, and I'm gonna rally humanity to smash your ass.
[02:39:08.249 --> 02:39:09.430]  I'm sorry to talk like that.
[02:39:09.650 --> 02:39:10.411]  I apologize.
[02:39:10.891 --> 02:39:11.752]  I'm just sick of it!
[02:39:12.132 --> 02:39:13.213]  I'm sick of them, Watson!
[02:39:15.387 --> 02:39:24.930]  Well, you've got a White House sign-saw who says we need a planetary regime that will sterilize people by force.
[02:39:25.431 --> 02:39:27.131]  And this is a guy in the White House.
[02:39:27.151 --> 02:39:28.812]  And I'm not supposed to get upset about that.
[02:39:28.872 --> 02:39:29.692]  You're not supposed to get upset.
[02:39:29.712 --> 02:39:36.334]  And now we have all the Rockefeller Foundation documents about putting stuff in vaccines to secretly sterilize you from where?
[02:39:36.615 --> 02:39:37.555]  Their own website.
[02:39:38.834 --> 02:39:57.749]  Yeah, the Rockefeller Foundation in 69 developed anti-fertility vaccines and these were later distributed by the World Health Organization and the UN Population Fund under their Task Force on Vaccines for Fertility Regulation.
[02:39:57.789 --> 02:40:00.291]  And by the way, that tetanus shot is an added goody!
[02:40:00.991 --> 02:40:14.380]  Uh, just like when they brain damage your kid, they then CPS your others, uh, in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, the added goody, uh, with the female hormone carried by the tetanus, uh, pathogen, uh, this is mainstream news.
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:15.180]  The UN did this.
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:23.606]  It, it also causes the women to have shutdown in their organs and, and kills a lot of them as an added soft kill.
[02:40:24.306 --> 02:40:25.607]  Oh, murdering women!
[02:40:27.621 --> 02:40:29.121]  And we're not supposed to get upset!
[02:40:29.442 --> 02:40:33.324]  We're supposed to bow down to Glenn Beck, because he's going to save us, Paul!
[02:40:35.605 --> 02:40:44.530]  Well, yeah, that was in the 90s when the WHO got caught distributing the tetanus vaccines only to women and girls.
[02:40:45.010 --> 02:40:48.792]  They were specific about that, even though, you know, boys and men can get tetanus as well.
[02:40:48.812 --> 02:40:49.933]  Well, that's feminist, it's liberal!
[02:40:49.953 --> 02:40:52.134]  They were helping the women!
[02:40:53.175 --> 02:41:02.798]  Only for the women and girls, and it was contaminated with this HCG hormone that, just by coincidence, caused involuntary abortion.
[02:41:03.418 --> 02:41:08.359]  And this is the organization that had sworn to distribute this anti-fertility vaccine.
[02:41:08.379 --> 02:41:09.860]  Don't forget the extra goody!
[02:41:10.140 --> 02:41:16.042]  It then causes autoimmune responses in the ovaries and other areas, and a lot of times kills the woman!
[02:41:16.062 --> 02:41:18.882]  Well, it's for the good of the Earth, I suppose.
[02:41:18.903 --> 02:41:19.143]  Liberal!
[02:41:19.463 --> 02:41:20.243]  It's liberal!
[02:41:22.376 --> 02:41:32.365]  Kind of like the fake Hispanic groups that are really running the coyotes and drug dealing and putting the little Mexican children and Latin Americans in slave cages and then murdering them.
[02:41:32.605 --> 02:41:33.286]  It's liberal.
[02:41:33.486 --> 02:41:36.829]  Or like the liberals helping abort 51% of the blacks.
[02:41:37.170 --> 02:41:37.810]  It's liberal.
[02:41:37.950 --> 02:41:41.213]  And if you don't want to kill the blacks, you're a racist.
[02:41:41.714 --> 02:41:42.414]  See, Paul?
[02:41:42.815 --> 02:41:46.798]  You need to learn to murder blacks and everybody else and then you're a liberal.
[02:41:47.179 --> 02:41:48.300]  You understand that, Watson?
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:53.364]  No, but I'm sure Bill Gates cares about the little black children in Africa.
[02:41:53.404 --> 02:41:54.204]  Yes!
[02:41:54.545 --> 02:42:04.333]  That's why he said during the TED conference earlier this year that through, quote, new vaccines they could lower the global population by 10 to 15 percent.
[02:42:04.393 --> 02:42:05.555]  And then everyone giggled!
[02:42:05.775 --> 02:42:14.783]  The yuppies paying thousands to be there, that was their little pleasure, their little enjoyment when they're looking at poor people as, we're quietly killing them, I've got
[02:42:14.943 --> 02:42:15.364]  Power!
[02:42:15.404 --> 02:42:16.526]  I'm a scumbag!
[02:42:16.826 --> 02:42:19.131]  I'm running around soft-killing everyone!
[02:42:19.872 --> 02:42:20.814]  And everyone giggled at...
[02:42:22.852 --> 02:42:30.719]  At Bill Gates up there going, once we have these vaccines to reduce population, they're like, oh God, we're joining in on the blood orgy!
[02:42:30.919 --> 02:42:33.361]  We're powerful too!
[02:42:33.701 --> 02:42:36.524]  But don't worry, your master will smash you flat in a pancake.
[02:42:37.084 --> 02:42:41.248]  Oh, the good part is all you scum are going to get it good from your own masters.
[02:42:41.528 --> 02:42:42.409]  You're going to love it!
[02:42:42.669 --> 02:42:43.730]  I'm sorry, go ahead, Watson.
[02:42:43.950 --> 02:42:48.554]  I should be taking this as no big deal that they're knowingly murdering millions of people.
[02:42:48.954 --> 02:42:49.955]  I shouldn't be upset.
[02:42:50.235 --> 02:42:51.156]  I'm the bad man.
[02:42:51.716 --> 02:42:53.018]  I'm the bad man, Watson.
[02:42:53.219 --> 02:42:54.200]  You're bad as well.
[02:42:54.421 --> 02:42:58.127]  How dare you ask people to Google the term vaccine deaths?
[02:42:58.608 --> 02:43:02.013]  How dare you warn them that worldwide this cover-up's imploding?
[02:43:02.173 --> 02:43:03.996]  And we have all the documents linked in the story.
[02:43:04.237 --> 02:43:05.959]  How dare you try to warn people?
[02:43:08.021 --> 02:43:08.661]  Well, exactly.
[02:43:08.721 --> 02:43:11.863]  I mean, hasn't LeBron James done or said something recently?
[02:43:11.903 --> 02:43:13.044]  That's got to be more important.
[02:43:13.884 --> 02:43:20.508]  But I mean, yeah, they paid about, what was it, $3,000 just to attend this conference with Bill Gates.
[02:43:20.828 --> 02:43:37.538]  So they charge people that because they know that only fellow members of the elite are going to pay that amount of money to listen to their leader, Bill Gates, who pledges, you know, $10 billion to, quote, research and develop vaccines for the third world, while at the same time,
[02:43:38.018 --> 02:43:42.040]  Saying that he's going to use vaccines to lower world population by 15%.
[02:43:42.460 --> 02:43:52.786]  Now, how does lowering world population by 15% coordinate with a drive to improve people's health in the third world?
[02:43:52.866 --> 02:43:58.269]  And then we're supposed to just roll our sleeves up and take the vaccines they're pushing on us, Paul.
[02:44:00.322 --> 02:44:02.684]  Yeah, but everybody's refusing.
[02:44:02.724 --> 02:44:05.867]  I mean, 6% in France, that's pathetic.
[02:44:06.627 --> 02:44:14.214]  And as more people become educated about this, which is why we're doing this today, more people will refuse the vaccines.
[02:44:14.394 --> 02:44:21.921]  Which is why 52% of Americans now have concerns about vaccines, but what are they doing now as a result of that?
[02:44:22.201 --> 02:44:26.625]  Putting them in the GM food, you know, vaccines in potatoes and things like that.
[02:44:26.745 --> 02:44:27.866]  Well, that was my next point!
[02:44:28.827 --> 02:44:29.307]  Here it is.
[02:44:29.387 --> 02:44:31.749]  Gates Foundation invest in Monsanto.
[02:44:32.309 --> 02:44:39.294]  Oh, they're helping Monsanto develop more pharmacological crops because they know that we're refusing to take our shots.
[02:44:39.314 --> 02:44:43.017]  So he's developing mosquitoes he releases to make you take your shots.
[02:44:45.552 --> 02:44:50.035]  It's now going to be in the foods you eat, because Bill Gates cares so much about you.
[02:44:50.395 --> 02:44:53.317]  His dad, the former head of Planned Parenthood, known eugenicist.
[02:44:53.677 --> 02:45:00.121]  Aren't we lucky that, according to the Times of London, they have secret eugenics meetings discussing world government?
[02:45:01.262 --> 02:45:02.863]  Aren't we lucky to have them, Paul?
[02:45:05.421 --> 02:45:11.647]  Well yeah, I mean, you know, they only care about helping people's health in the third world, that's why they're trying to kill them.
[02:45:12.748 --> 02:45:15.391]  Those two ideas don't connect really, do they?
[02:45:15.431 --> 02:45:17.974]  So I'm waiting for an explanation on that.
[02:45:18.674 --> 02:45:22.798]  But yeah, now, you know, statting drugs in junk food they're talking about.
[02:45:22.878 --> 02:45:25.962]  They're talking about putting statting drugs in the
[02:45:26.542 --> 02:45:26.943]  What's
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:43.920]  More and more numbers.
[02:45:44.100 --> 02:45:47.641]  They're just going to do it without consent by putting it in our food and water.
[02:45:47.661 --> 02:45:48.942]  No, it's just like drones.
[02:45:49.022 --> 02:45:51.043]  It's just like being tracked by the cell phones.
[02:45:51.423 --> 02:45:57.865]  It's just like the news going, yeah, all school children will wear RFID tags embedded in their clothes and it's meant to track.
[02:45:58.385 --> 02:46:03.487]  10, 11 years ago, I'd tell folks it was meant to track everybody because I had the Pentagon's own declassified documents to get laughed at.
[02:46:03.827 --> 02:46:04.767]  Now it's out in the open.
[02:46:05.347 --> 02:46:10.269]  And we've got a fluoride head population here in Europe and the United States who loves it.
[02:46:10.709 --> 02:46:12.390]  They love being poisoned!
[02:46:12.410 --> 02:46:13.151]  They love death!
[02:46:14.071 --> 02:46:17.233]  And so, you know, I guess these parents just enjoy it, Paul.
[02:46:19.935 --> 02:46:33.924]  But there's a good percentage that are waking up to it and resisting it, which is why they're trying to take over the internet, which segues into the other article that I wrote today about this quote, independent think tank.
[02:46:34.064 --> 02:46:37.086]  If you look into it, really, it's a PR firm for the government.
[02:46:38.166 --> 02:46:49.893]  called Demos and they put out a report saying that the government needs to infiltrate conspiracy websites because they need to restore trust in the government.
[02:46:50.573 --> 02:46:53.675]  Now, you know, why do people distrust the government?
[02:46:53.735 --> 02:46:57.377]  Because they're being caught habitually lying about everything under the sun.
[02:46:58.177 --> 02:47:15.613]  That's the same thing Cass Sunstein talks about, and we've got the infiltration of the churches, the corporations with InfraGard, the top-secret USA spies, your own private spy groups, and now we should trust them infiltrating us, Paul, because that's not creepy to have a government infiltrating.
[02:47:16.906 --> 02:47:18.507]  No, it's not illegal at all.
[02:47:18.547 --> 02:47:21.668]  I mean, COINTELPRO, that was perfectly above board, wasn't it?
[02:47:22.209 --> 02:47:28.552]  But this was put out by Demos, which was founded by Marxists in 1993.
[02:47:28.692 --> 02:47:32.694]  It originated out of a Marxist media publication.
[02:47:33.715 --> 02:47:39.458]  Some of these individuals then went on to become part of Tony Blair's government in 1997.
[02:47:39.838 --> 02:47:45.801]  And now the new Conservative British Prime Minister, David Cameron, is meeting with Demos
[02:47:46.081 --> 02:47:57.673]  running projects with Demos, these admitted Marxists, who are now saying that the government needs to infiltrate conspiracy websites like ours to, you know, restore trust in the government.
[02:47:58.654 --> 02:48:03.339]  To restore trust in the government, how about having the government tell us the truth once in a while?
[02:48:03.359 --> 02:48:08.424]  Now let's notice, you're flip-flopped in England with the exact same system.
[02:48:09.105 --> 02:48:28.672]  You had the, quote, liberal Gordon Brown after 14 years of Blair and then Brown, so you were given the Bilderberg Group fake conservative who accelerates carbon taxes, pre-crime cameras, CPS grabbing your children, cameras going in homes of people that have had newborn children, worse than 1984.
[02:48:30.273 --> 02:48:38.017]  He's hooked him with Common Purpose, all these globalist organizations, so he's the right-wing savior from the liberal tyranny.
[02:48:38.377 --> 02:48:48.543]  Now we have Obama, the left-wing savior from the right-wing tyranny, and now we're gonna get our right-wing savior right about the time you get your next left-wing savior.
[02:48:48.563 --> 02:48:49.023]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:48:50.996 --> 02:48:51.476]  Exactly.
[02:48:51.496 --> 02:48:53.577]  I mean, that's the trick they tried to pull.
[02:48:53.957 --> 02:49:04.941]  The problem with it is that Cameron didn't even get, you know, a majority vote, which is why they had to have this stupid Punch and Judy show with Clegg and this coalition government.
[02:49:06.201 --> 02:49:31.463]  Oh yeah, Cameron's meeting with Demos, just as Blair did before him, and the woman who sits on the advisory board of Demos is also the executive director of Common Purpose, the group you just mentioned, which, as Brian Gerrish has exposed, at cpexposed.com, is this insidious network of individuals who have penetrated the British government to advance Britain towards this new world order.
[02:49:31.903 --> 02:49:33.425]  And these are the people saying that
[02:49:33.925 --> 02:49:41.108]  We need to, quote, modify our notion of freedom, because freedom is misused and abused by terrorists.
[02:49:41.128 --> 02:49:42.449]  Yeah, and that's the key to all they do.
[02:49:42.509 --> 02:49:47.431]  They always say, we're going to redefine society, and we do the defining.
[02:49:48.151 --> 02:49:54.134]  And so, you being injected with something that brain damages you, we call that a cognitive enhancer.
[02:49:54.214 --> 02:49:57.535]  Mercury, brain damaging, is what we want.
[02:49:57.695 --> 02:49:58.656]  That's an enhancement.
[02:49:59.076 --> 02:50:00.919]  See, it's all lawyer-speak.
[02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:02.622]  And they're just assaulting us.
[02:50:02.642 --> 02:50:05.606]  They're a pack of criminals using flim-flam on us.
[02:50:06.107 --> 02:50:08.410]  And separately, we've got Kurt Nemo's article here.
[02:50:09.878 --> 02:50:23.024]  Justice Department, Obama's Justice Department, puts out Master Patriot Hit List, not just saying that you're an extremist if you like Ron Paul and the Second Amendment, but you're a criminal terrorist, Paul.
[02:50:23.404 --> 02:50:25.185]  Now see, they're the terrorists, clearly.
[02:50:25.545 --> 02:50:30.667]  People coming in and saying our freedom and our liberty is terrorism, they're the terrorists, Paul.
[02:50:32.324 --> 02:50:36.047]  Oh yeah, I mean, this is precisely what this UK report says.
[02:50:36.127 --> 02:50:49.076]  It says that people who put out conspiracy theories, that is, any viewpoint that disagrees with this lying government, is not only an extremist but also a recruiter and an enabler of terrorists.
[02:50:49.477 --> 02:50:58.163]  So now if you disagree with the government who carried out 7-7 and say that, you know, show all this evidence that they were involved, then that makes you the terrorist.
[02:50:58.203 --> 02:50:58.823]  Well done!
[02:50:58.863 --> 02:50:59.344]  Stay with us.
[02:50:59.884 --> 02:51:01.966]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[02:51:02.406 --> 02:51:05.509]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[02:51:05.969 --> 02:51:13.956]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[02:51:14.477 --> 02:51:19.381]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[02:51:19.961 --> 02:51:25.046]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[02:51:25.566 --> 02:51:33.091]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness, and put up tons of free food too.
[02:51:33.611 --> 02:51:38.615]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[02:51:39.055 --> 02:51:40.276]  Our foods are their enemy.
[02:51:40.876 --> 02:51:46.339]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[02:51:46.719 --> 02:51:49.380]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[02:51:49.700 --> 02:51:53.162]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[02:51:53.202 --> 02:51:55.363]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence!
[02:51:59.725 --> 02:52:02.048]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:02.128 --> 02:52:04.311]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:04.331 --> 02:52:07.275]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:07.656 --> 02:52:12.402]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:12.762 --> 02:52:16.948]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:17.248 --> 02:52:19.591]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:19.611 --> 02:52:22.134]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:22.495 --> 02:52:25.058]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:25.418 --> 02:52:33.008]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:33.348 --> 02:52:38.593]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:38.613 --> 02:52:41.016]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:41.056 --> 02:52:45.019]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:46.221]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:46.361 --> 02:52:47.662]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:47.682 --> 02:52:48.703]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:14.867 --> 02:53:16.028]  Thinking loan modification?
[02:53:16.288 --> 02:53:17.708]  That still keeps you in default.
[02:53:17.969 --> 02:53:26.512]  Zero debt in 90 days is the only proven system that keeps you in your house for as long as you want to stay, while making it possible to even get clear title to your house.

[02:54:18.424 --> 02:54:20.747]  Folks, I'm going to be back tomorrow more focused.
[02:54:20.767 --> 02:54:23.271]  I mean, this has been an informative broadcast.
[02:54:23.331 --> 02:54:32.023]  I'm just so enraged and sick of how absurdist all of this corruption has gotten that I'm just having trouble dealing with it.
[02:54:33.148 --> 02:54:34.989]  I mean, I'm having a lot of trouble dealing with it.
[02:54:35.810 --> 02:54:47.917]  And I think about the fact that Bayer Pharmaceutical, one example, knew for more than a decade they were shipping out Factor VIII blood clotting product that they knew would give every person that took it hepatitis and HIV.
[02:54:48.618 --> 02:54:53.040]  And it came out in court that they knew it and that it wasn't just about profit.
[02:54:53.581 --> 02:54:55.462]  It was, hey, let's get rid of hemophiliacs.
[02:54:56.906 --> 02:54:59.447]  These people are beyond just greedy.
[02:54:59.847 --> 02:55:01.367]  They like evil.
[02:55:02.308 --> 02:55:16.511]  And if you take any vaccine, this government sells you, if you take any vaccine these companies put out, if you're eating melamine, if you're drinking out of bisphenol A containers, just stop!
[02:55:17.472 --> 02:55:19.092]  Stop the madness, folks!
[02:55:22.793 --> 02:55:25.434]  Look, the good news is, like Watson said, people are waking up.
[02:55:27.355 --> 02:55:32.106]  But it's just so brazen they're back again with their flu shots this year.
[02:55:33.048 --> 02:55:37.138]  Watson, in closing, you've got this article dealing with vaccine deaths.
[02:55:38.314 --> 02:55:40.956]  and injury skyrocket as cover-up implodes.
[02:55:41.336 --> 02:55:43.077]  The search term today is vaccine deaths.
[02:55:43.157 --> 02:55:44.818]  I commend everybody for continuing to do this.
[02:55:45.159 --> 02:55:46.620]  It's really reaching a lot of new people.
[02:55:47.260 --> 02:55:50.342]  Go to the article at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:55:50.462 --> 02:55:54.565]  Email it to everyone you know and tell them this is the history of what's happened.
[02:55:54.905 --> 02:56:03.971]  A global revolt against deadly vaccine spreads as cases of debilitating illness, soft kill side effects and even instant deaths becomes widespread.
[02:56:04.812 --> 02:56:07.394]  And they're going to try to
[02:56:08.339 --> 02:56:19.686]  Pull out all the stops to suppress us and to intimidate us and have dirty tricks to stop us because they've gone so far in their crimes that if we start standing up to them, they know they're going to prison.
[02:56:20.146 --> 02:56:24.549]  Watson, in closing, amazing article that you also put together.
[02:56:25.249 --> 02:56:28.271]  Give folks the title of the article about the
[02:56:29.372 --> 02:56:35.495]  How the government's saying, here it is, government think tank calls for infiltrating conspiracy websites.
[02:56:35.936 --> 02:56:39.858]  And this isn't from PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com, though you wrote a more detailed article.
[02:56:40.198 --> 02:56:41.479]  This is the London Independent.
[02:56:41.759 --> 02:56:51.264]  I mean, they're out in the open, posing as us, trying to get us to infight, trying to make us look stupid, and doing so many other dirty tricks, Paul.
[02:56:52.745 --> 02:56:54.887]  Yeah, and it's because we're winning.
[02:56:55.487 --> 02:56:58.169]  I mean, look at the climate change argument.
[02:56:58.470 --> 02:57:02.133]  You've got all these alarmists now admitting, you know, we've lost.
[02:57:02.573 --> 02:57:03.754]  Cap and Trade's dead.
[02:57:03.814 --> 02:57:06.056]  They're still trying to implement it on the local level.
[02:57:06.556 --> 02:57:16.324]  But there's a great article we posted today about the Chicago Climate Exchange, which is completely collapsing, and Gore and Marie Strong and all of them are having to abandon it.
[02:57:16.684 --> 02:57:25.686]  So, we won on the climate change issue, and we can also defeat this vaccine cover-up, which we are doing, you know, as the polls show.
[02:57:25.726 --> 02:57:28.607]  The majority of Americans now share the same concerns.
[02:57:28.667 --> 02:57:32.228]  Yeah, I'm going to show people, I'm going to show them a document cam shot of this.
[02:57:32.248 --> 02:57:35.729]  Here it is, the great collapse of the Chicago Climate Exchange.
[02:57:36.129 --> 02:57:37.889]  That's something we've got to continue to fight.
[02:57:37.949 --> 02:57:39.790]  And then this, all over the country,
[02:57:40.450 --> 02:57:52.304]  Children are being made to wear RFID tags in government clothes, government uniforms at public schools, and they're making them all enroll in Junior ROTC in kindergarten.
[02:57:52.924 --> 02:57:54.947]  I mean, Watson, you cannot make this stuff up!
[02:57:56.974 --> 02:58:06.664]  Well, yeah, and it's all to, you know, train children from a very young age that they're part of a prison system, that they're subjects of Big Brother.
[02:58:07.505 --> 02:58:10.348]  And that's why we need to strip that out of the schools immediately.
[02:58:10.408 --> 02:58:18.357]  It's nothing to do with, you know, they soft-pedal it as not a big problem, but it's training children to be slaves of the system.
[02:58:18.857 --> 02:58:19.498]  Absolutely.
[02:58:19.558 --> 02:58:21.119]  Paul Joseph Watson's been our guest.
[02:58:21.479 --> 02:58:23.781]  Keep up the great work over at PrisonPlanet.com, Watson.
[02:58:23.801 --> 02:58:25.162]  I'm going to call you after the show in a moment.
[02:58:26.123 --> 02:58:28.265]  Coming up, I get into Glenn Beck and a lot more.
[02:58:28.285 --> 02:58:32.288]  Tomorrow I'll be back with more calls and a bunch of the news I didn't get to.
[02:58:32.609 --> 02:58:33.810]  I'm going to be quite frank with you.
[02:58:34.210 --> 02:58:36.032]  I'm just completely shaken up by all this.
[02:58:36.072 --> 02:58:37.873]  This is even more real than I thought it was.
[02:58:37.893 --> 02:58:38.994]  We're completely in trouble.
[02:58:41.176 --> 02:58:42.897]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.659 --> 02:58:45.840]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:49.352 --> 02:58:53.274]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
