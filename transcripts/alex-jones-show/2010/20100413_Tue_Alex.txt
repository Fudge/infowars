[00:00:04.278 --> 00:00:04.919]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:06.620]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.481]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:09.922]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.702 --> 00:00:11.603]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.243 --> 00:00:15.865]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:20.488]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.037 --> 00:00:26.358]  We have reached the midway point in this Tuesday transmission.
[00:00:26.378 --> 00:00:31.339]  We are simulcasting the third and fourth hour live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.481]  Webster Griffin Tarbley is popping in in the next hour to talk about Obama's false flag nuclear blackmail that's going on.
[00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.382]  Clearly preparing for a staged event.
[00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:44.582]  Bare minimum engaged in psychological warfare.
[00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:46.003]  Paul Watson
[00:00:46.883 --> 00:00:51.365]  We'll be joining us in the last 30 minutes, but I'm going to cover this before he joins us.
[00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:52.425]  We'll just get into more detail.
[00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:53.606]  AP!
[00:00:54.106 --> 00:00:55.686]  Not Prison Planet two weeks ago.
[00:00:56.587 --> 00:00:57.287]  AP today.
[00:00:58.667 --> 00:00:59.628]  Good job, everybody.
[00:01:01.268 --> 00:01:05.290]  Foes of Tea Party movement to infiltrate rallies pose as racist.
[00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.950]  This has already been going on.
[00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.271]  We're going to go over the evidence coming up.
[00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:10.852]  This is so important.
[00:01:12.278 --> 00:01:21.443]  They're gonna brand you as racist, brand their New World Order takeover like it's some civil rights movement, and stage terror attacks, and start arresting patriots.
[00:01:22.043 --> 00:01:23.844]  This is already going on to a certain extent.
[00:01:24.404 --> 00:01:25.705]  We understand their game plan.
[00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:27.346]  We understand their operation.
[00:01:28.186 --> 00:01:30.428]  We have the enemy's operation manual.
[00:01:30.868 --> 00:01:35.710]  We know their program, and with that knowledge, if we take action and have the initiative, we can defeat them.
[00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.232]  Knowing the enemy is half the battle.
[00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:40.695]  Let's go to your calls.
[00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:42.256]  David in California, you're on the air.
[00:01:43.816 --> 00:01:44.756]  AJ, how you doing, man?
[00:01:45.457 --> 00:01:47.097]  I'm alright, because we're having a lot of victories.
[00:01:48.498 --> 00:01:49.598]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:49.878 --> 00:01:59.441]  One thing I gotta say is that David Rockefeller said, all you need is one more world crisis to bring in the new world order, and listening to Obama say this stuff makes you think a real lot.
[00:02:00.356 --> 00:02:01.297]  That's an incredible point.
[00:02:01.337 --> 00:02:08.665]  In fact, guys, Google David Rockefeller about all we need is a crisis for global transformation to bring in the New World Order.
[00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:12.029]  And then the Kissinger Club about UN troops.
[00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.490]  Just Kissinger, UN troops.
[00:02:13.991 --> 00:02:17.534]  And then the David Rockefeller quote about we're on the verge of a global transformation.
[00:02:17.935 --> 00:02:19.296]  All we need is the right crisis.
[00:02:19.336 --> 00:02:19.637]  Go ahead.
[00:02:20.822 --> 00:02:21.363]  Right, right.
[00:02:21.743 --> 00:02:24.105]  And it doesn't even have to be a nuke just in the United States.
[00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.227]  They could just do a couple all over the world.
[00:02:26.627 --> 00:02:30.630]  And I also want to bring up one point about the Samuel Jack movie you're talking about.
[00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:35.414]  This also reminds me of that X-Files that they did, like, nine months before 9-11.
[00:02:35.434 --> 00:02:39.157]  Seems like they're just trying to, like, trap us for something like this.
[00:02:39.538 --> 00:02:42.540]  Trying to put it through the media and get it into our brains.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.102]  So, once it happens,
[00:02:45.103 --> 00:02:46.845]  Yeah, another fabulous point.
[00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:51.772]  The lone gunman, and I had the star of The Lone Gunman call me and come to Austin to meet with me.
[00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:59.722]  He said the CIA, Dean Hagelin, was planting those scripts on them and Chris Carter, this is from the host,
[00:03:00.523 --> 00:03:15.653]  And what was it, six or seven months before 9-11, the government hijacks a jet to fly at the World Trade Center, a passenger jet, as a pretext to invade Afghanistan, and uses a drill simultaneously to make NORAD stand down.
[00:03:15.914 --> 00:03:17.895]  That exact thing happened on 9-11.
[00:03:19.176 --> 00:03:20.137]  Right, right, right.
[00:03:20.737 --> 00:03:26.341]  It seems like it's just repeating itself, and not only you are like doing the red alarm right now,
[00:03:27.242 --> 00:03:30.845]  I listen to Steve Quayle a little bit here and there, and you know, he says the same thing.
[00:03:30.865 --> 00:03:38.431]  Me and myself, just being woken up for two years and going way deeper into everything, watching all your documentaries, reading books, listening to you every day.
[00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:40.453]  I feel the same thing, brother.
[00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:48.400]  It just feels like that these people are really going to have to move something because we're getting so much stronger right now, awakening people that
[00:03:49.088 --> 00:03:53.289]  They're really gonna have to make some moves right now, and I can really see them doing... Exactly!
[00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:56.530]  Their agenda's in place, but it's cracking at the foundations.
[00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:04.152]  They're in trouble, and we know how they operate, and everybody, not just intellectually, can see the evidence, but you can feel it.
[00:04:04.812 --> 00:04:10.153]  Anybody who's got their head screwed on straight and has any discernment can feel the evil rising.
[00:04:11.894 --> 00:04:12.774]  Right, right, right.
[00:04:13.434 --> 00:04:15.394]  Uh, so that's pretty much all I have to say, AJ.
[00:04:15.774 --> 00:04:16.655]  Thanks for everything.
[00:04:16.675 --> 00:04:17.795]  I'm burning DVDs.
[00:04:18.604 --> 00:04:19.925]  And let's try to win this thing.
[00:04:19.965 --> 00:04:21.627]  You know, keep up the rage, man.
[00:04:21.647 --> 00:04:24.449]  I love it when you get angry, man, because we all should be angry about this.
[00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:25.190]  All right?
[00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.950]  Have a good day.
[00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:26.931]  Thank you.
[00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:32.856]  You know when I tend to get enraged is when I watch videos, video after video.
[00:04:33.036 --> 00:04:36.019]  You just search engine, police beat man in wheelchair.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.642]  There's videos of people with no legs, people paralyzed.
[00:04:40.663 --> 00:04:41.403]  They say, get up.
[00:04:41.443 --> 00:04:42.304]  They say, I can't.
[00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:44.386]  They say it nicely.
[00:04:44.426 --> 00:04:45.366]  The police beat them.
[00:04:46.716 --> 00:04:51.442]  I have all those videos, I can't even play them here, because I can't watch them.
[00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:58.209]  I watch them once to have the knowledge, and I... It makes me too angry.
[00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.171]  I mean, I just...
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.861]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:13.344]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:18.105]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:29.509]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:39.151]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:39.651 --> 00:05:44.692]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:45.093 --> 00:05:52.254]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:52.574 --> 00:05:54.975]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:04.262]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:04.623 --> 00:06:08.346]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:08.546 --> 00:06:10.788]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:16.254]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:06:16.674 --> 00:06:22.900]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.883]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:29.303 --> 00:06:32.985]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:33.485 --> 00:06:37.467]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:37.768 --> 00:06:43.691]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:43.711 --> 00:06:46.612]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:47.273 --> 00:06:48.673]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:49.254 --> 00:06:49.674]  It's here.

[00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:04.837]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:07:06.097 --> 00:07:10.878]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:17.940]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:07:19.963 --> 00:07:23.028]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:26.293]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:32.314]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:07:33.055 --> 00:07:36.177]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[00:07:36.858 --> 00:07:37.679]  Others don't.
[00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:40.000]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:07:40.261 --> 00:07:41.762]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:07:42.042 --> 00:07:44.604]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:07:44.944 --> 00:07:51.190]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.772]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:07:54.272 --> 00:07:56.314]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[00:07:56.634 --> 00:07:57.515]  Others don't.
[00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:03.143]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.163 --> 00:08:06.508]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:29.073 --> 00:08:34.837]  Ladies and gentlemen, the new film, Invisible Empire, is now shipping out of this office.
[00:08:34.877 --> 00:08:39.900]  Many of you around the country will get it on or before the 15th of April, 2010.
[00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:43.542]  18 months in the making.
[00:08:43.562 --> 00:08:48.105]  And for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, we have a stack of them right here.
[00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:54.149]  Here is the actual DVD in the hard case with the hard cover.
[00:08:54.989 --> 00:08:57.512]  The New World Order on trial for the first time ever.
[00:08:57.812 --> 00:09:01.816]  The secret agenda of the planet's ruthless superclass is exposed in stark detail.
[00:09:02.196 --> 00:09:10.705]  This documentary film chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:09:11.185 --> 00:09:18.713]  Learn how this global oligarchy controls the populace through drug trafficking, money laundering, staged terror attacks, and media propaganda and debt.
[00:09:19.153 --> 00:09:24.537]  The criminal controllers have successfully dominated the globe and are now in the final phase of consolidating power.
[00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:28.460]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists of their own words and documents.
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.802]  Worldwide tyranny isn't coming, ladies and gentlemen, it's here.
[00:09:32.243 --> 00:09:35.045]  This isn't conspiracy theory, it's conspiracy fact.
[00:09:35.085 --> 00:09:40.529]  The New World Order is out in the open, all documented, in stunning living color.
[00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:45.870]  Unelected bureaucrats are establishing regional unions under one super state.
[00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:53.376]  Witness their plan for a global tax and a cashless society surveillance grid in which every man, woman, and child is microchipped at birth.
[00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:57.562]  And the extras are Peter Del Scott interview and G20 Pittsburgh.
[00:09:58.623 --> 00:10:05.946]  Again, I am so proud of this film and the great work of my crew and Jason Burmas over the last 18 months making Invisible Empire.
[00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:08.427]  Incredible graphics, but the information is what's important.
[00:10:09.127 --> 00:10:12.349]  A great tool to wake friends and family up.
[00:10:12.409 --> 00:10:14.149]  Get it at InfoWars.com.
[00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.111]  The hard copy DVD or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:10:22.953 --> 00:10:27.416]  I have directed 25 films and I have produced three others.
[00:10:27.997 --> 00:10:35.302]  So that's 28 documentary films since I started making films 13 and a half years ago.
[00:10:35.322 --> 00:10:38.123]  I've been on the air 15 years, right at 15 years.
[00:10:38.144 --> 00:10:43.027]  I've been making films for 13 plus years and that's 28 films.
[00:10:43.067 --> 00:10:44.328]  So how many films is that a year?
[00:10:44.868 --> 00:10:45.408]  Roughly two.
[00:10:46.449 --> 00:10:50.815]  Uh, so I'm just really proud of the crew, and they just get better and better and more informative.
[00:10:51.095 --> 00:10:56.923]  And now it's all out in the open, so, uh, you know, this isn't us showing you secret government documents or, you know, clips.
[00:10:56.983 --> 00:10:58.745]  This is, this is in their own words.
[00:10:59.065 --> 00:11:02.009]  Invisible empire, a new world order defined.
[00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:03.571]  Burmas got so happy when these came in.
[00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:03.771]  He was...
[00:11:04.352 --> 00:11:04.872]  Hugging me.
[00:11:05.333 --> 00:11:07.054]  So Burmess is very, very excited.
[00:11:07.574 --> 00:11:10.776]  And it's up to you whether this goes viral and has a huge effect.
[00:11:10.796 --> 00:11:13.958]  You can also watch it premiering after the show, 3 p.m.
[00:11:13.998 --> 00:11:16.420]  Central, on Thursday the 15th.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.401]  It will premiere at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:11:18.441 --> 00:11:19.802]  You can burn it to disk.
[00:11:20.102 --> 00:11:20.883]  Give it to everybody you know.
[00:11:21.263 --> 00:11:21.563]  Okay.
[00:11:23.064 --> 00:11:24.385]  I've got to control myself now.
[00:11:25.426 --> 00:11:28.548]  Because I have got
[00:11:30.536 --> 00:11:38.020]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 stacks of news that I have to at least skim the surface of.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.483]  But four or five of these stacks, I have to go into detail, and we've got two guests coming up next hour.
[00:11:42.503 --> 00:11:53.649]  So I'm going to move as quickly as I can right now through some calls to the bottom of the hour, then I'm news blitzing for the next half hour before Webster Tarpoli and then Paul Watson join us.
[00:11:54.729 --> 00:11:59.933]  But right now, let's go to Leo in Missouri, or is it Montana?
[00:11:59.953 --> 00:12:00.714]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:12:01.294 --> 00:12:02.375]  Yeah, it's Missouri.
[00:12:02.475 --> 00:12:03.476]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:12:04.317 --> 00:12:19.809]  I wanted to say, I believe the false flag attack is actually speaking of a false flag attack because it takes the focus off of what's really hurting this country, and that's the economy and this health care bill, which is really going to tax us, possibly the death for some people.
[00:12:20.666 --> 00:12:25.771]  And I really believe that's the actual false flag attack, not so much an actual nuclear attack.
[00:12:25.791 --> 00:12:26.211]  No, no, absolutely.
[00:12:26.352 --> 00:12:26.932]  Absolutely.
[00:12:26.952 --> 00:12:38.443]  And that's what I'm going to cover coming up when I recap this and get into more detail on some facets I haven't gotten into, is that Governor Ridge is on record that when he was the head of Homeland Security, they would issue fake terror alerts for political gain.
[00:12:38.784 --> 00:12:40.225]  That is an act of terrorism.
[00:12:40.485 --> 00:12:41.867]  If you call a bomb threat in,
[00:12:42.827 --> 00:12:44.749]  And you haven't really sent a bomb to the courthouse.
[00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:49.651]  You still get a felony charge because it created the fear and endangered people.
[00:12:50.352 --> 00:12:52.133]  It's like yelling fire in a theater or worse.
[00:12:52.573 --> 00:12:54.935]  And we know they've done this in the past.
[00:12:55.215 --> 00:12:56.896]  We know Al-Qaeda's manufactured.
[00:12:57.116 --> 00:12:58.577]  We know they're not really going to nuke us.
[00:12:58.857 --> 00:13:01.679]  And I agree, bare minimum, this is a psychological terror attack.
[00:13:02.479 --> 00:13:06.201]  Right, and I'm to the point where I'm not scared of this stuff anymore.
[00:13:06.462 --> 00:13:11.745]  If anything, it makes me more angry because I'm one of those people, if you hit me, I'm going to hit you back twice as hard.
[00:13:12.378 --> 00:13:14.399]  And that's the way I think we gotta look at stuff like this.
[00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:18.722]  When they come out with stuff like this, we just gotta say, okay, if you're gonna do it, then go ahead and do it.
[00:13:18.943 --> 00:13:21.905]  Otherwise, keep your mouth shut, and just let us live.
[00:13:22.105 --> 00:13:29.070]  And it's important to stand up and say, we know you're behind it, we know you're engaged in psychological and physical terrorism, and to hound...
[00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:34.611]  Obama, Al Gore, Newt Gingrich, and that's happening everywhere these globalists go.
[00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:38.453]  They are being hounded and exposed by real Americans.
[00:13:38.533 --> 00:13:42.194]  And the same thing's happening all over the world by patriots that understand the cost.
[00:13:42.454 --> 00:13:45.755]  We need to let them know that we know, and that's freaking them out.
[00:13:46.135 --> 00:13:54.898]  Because if we expose false flag terror and how it's used at every level, now AP confirming that Democratic operatives are infiltrating and posing as racist.
[00:13:55.278 --> 00:13:57.618]  Again, I told you that years ago, not because I'm smart.
[00:13:58.019 --> 00:13:59.059]  I study these people.
[00:13:59.699 --> 00:14:00.600]  I mean, it's real simple.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:13.232]  I mean, it's like if I'm fishing and a purple worm with a green tail, I'm catching bass every time I cast it, but I put a red worm on with a gold tail and I don't catch any fish, I know it's a purple worm.
[00:14:13.593 --> 00:14:17.396]  I'm not that smart, folks, but I can see how things work by watching.
[00:14:17.877 --> 00:14:22.481]  And that's all I've done is watch these people and read their own documents over and over and over and over again.
[00:14:22.741 --> 00:14:23.822]  I'll be on the air in a month.
[00:14:24.682 --> 00:14:41.333]  Saying, as AP even admitted, the Democrats are staging the racist signs and things at these Tea Parties and there'll be websites saying Alex is a liar because I won't have the AP that day in my hand.
[00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:44.274]  I happen to have it today because it just came out.
[00:14:44.314 --> 00:14:45.075]  That's the problem.
[00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:47.176]  I've got too much evidence, Leo.
[00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:48.517]  I mean, here's the headline.
[00:14:48.737 --> 00:14:52.179]  Foes of Tea Party movement infiltrate rallies and pose as racist.
[00:14:52.219 --> 00:14:52.860]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:14:54.217 --> 00:14:55.038]  You're exactly right.
[00:14:55.078 --> 00:15:00.320]  And if people keep their eyes open, they'll even see it on their local level, the bullying that's being done by their government.
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.981]  And it's just like facing a bully.
[00:15:03.002 --> 00:15:08.904]  You've got to face them down until he either leaves you alone or you get them down and you beat him until he leaves you alone.
[00:15:09.505 --> 00:15:11.266]  And that's where I think we're at now.
[00:15:11.326 --> 00:15:16.068]  People need to stop being scared of all this stuff and actually face them down.
[00:15:17.276 --> 00:15:21.858]  And say, hey, we're not putting up with your garbage anymore, so either do what you're going to do, or we're going to do what we're going to do.
[00:15:22.178 --> 00:15:22.638]  Go ahead.
[00:15:22.658 --> 00:15:25.079]  Take my call.
[00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:26.520]  Thank you so much.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.020]  Absolutely.
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.222]  I mean, that's why they're on the news saying the Tea Partiers are terrorists.
[00:15:31.262 --> 00:15:32.882]  The Tea Partiers flew a plane into a building.
[00:15:33.102 --> 00:15:34.723]  The Tea Partiers shot up the building.
[00:15:34.963 --> 00:15:36.424]  The Tea Partiers are going to attack.
[00:15:36.624 --> 00:15:39.705]  We've got to have naked body scanners or the terrorists will get us.
[00:15:39.745 --> 00:15:40.886]  And it turns out it was staged.
[00:15:40.926 --> 00:15:45.988]  I mean, it's admitted that that guy was a government minion and that they got him on the airplane.
[00:15:46.208 --> 00:15:46.768]  Case closed.
[00:15:48.089 --> 00:15:49.330]  It's all staged.
[00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:58.634]  I mean, do people think I got up here a year ago, and then again two weeks ago, hot and heavy, every day, saying the Democrats are going to infiltrate the Tea Parties and stage violence and pose as racist?
[00:15:59.395 --> 00:16:01.496]  I mean, do you think I was just saying that, folks?
[00:16:01.776 --> 00:16:03.557]  We were on their websites.
[00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:05.398]  We were reading what they were saying.
[00:16:06.317 --> 00:16:08.059]  We know what they're doing.
[00:16:08.319 --> 00:16:10.060]  False flag terror.
[00:16:11.121 --> 00:16:19.828]  It's terrorizing the Tea Parties who want to end the Federal Reserve, cut taxes and get our country back, and protect our Second Amendment and our borders, and a bunch of good people.
[00:16:19.868 --> 00:16:20.709]  In fact, they've polled them.
[00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:23.351]  40% are Independents or Democrats.
[00:16:24.352 --> 00:16:27.475]  Most of them are people who never got politically involved and have lost their job.
[00:16:29.352 --> 00:16:30.013]  And are angry!
[00:16:30.313 --> 00:16:32.675]  And the media says, no, you're a racist terrorist!
[00:16:33.236 --> 00:16:36.418]  I mean, folks, that exposes 9-11 right there.
[00:16:36.478 --> 00:16:40.122]  Look how they call you a terrorist for being a Tea Party person, or a racist.
[00:16:40.182 --> 00:16:41.223]  It's the same thing.
[00:16:41.683 --> 00:16:47.168]  Look how they're saying I'm calling for violence when I'm calling for the opposite every day in major newspapers and television.
[00:16:47.669 --> 00:16:47.969]  Why?
[00:16:48.289 --> 00:16:50.551]  They think their audience are a bunch of idiots.
[00:16:51.092 --> 00:16:55.496]  They think their audience is so stupid, they won't go find out what Alex Jones is really saying.
[00:16:56.448 --> 00:17:00.230]  Like I said, I watched five minutes of Chris Matthews last night and everything he said was a lie.
[00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:01.411]  Everything!
[00:17:02.351 --> 00:17:06.613]  All of his guests, it was like a tree full of parrots repeating lies over and over.
[00:17:07.033 --> 00:17:10.935]  And then they, to make it worse, they were calling us liars!
[00:17:11.736 --> 00:17:15.058]  Everything they were saying was a lie about the health care bill.
[00:17:15.138 --> 00:17:16.218]  I've read the stinking thing.
[00:17:21.221 --> 00:17:22.622]  I'm just ranting, I'm out of control.
[00:17:24.042 --> 00:17:25.143]  We need to get out of control though.
[00:17:26.972 --> 00:17:28.774]  We need to get angry and get out of our comfort zone.
[00:17:29.354 --> 00:17:30.055]  Leo, thank you.
[00:17:30.095 --> 00:17:31.316]  Dee in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[00:17:32.036 --> 00:17:32.517]  Hi, Alex.
[00:17:32.957 --> 00:17:38.762]  I was able to go to that thomas.loc.gov and I was able to find the bill there, like you said.
[00:17:38.822 --> 00:17:41.264]  Again, you know where to go to get the information.
[00:17:41.344 --> 00:17:41.684]  Thank you.
[00:17:42.185 --> 00:17:42.885]  You bet.
[00:17:43.326 --> 00:17:48.650]  Secondly, and it wasn't bad, there was death panels and stuff in there.
[00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.753]  Oh, it's all, oh, death panels, it's all in there.
[00:17:53.095 --> 00:17:57.617]  I had a question, one thing to report and then a question.
[00:17:57.637 --> 00:17:59.878]  A couple questions actually.
[00:18:01.078 --> 00:18:05.980]  There was a story in Haaretz, I found it on Al Jazeera and it linked to Haaretz.
[00:18:06.981 --> 00:18:12.183]  The Israeli army did an order where they're going to start evicting Palestinians.
[00:18:13.388 --> 00:18:15.330]  That didn't have the quote-unquote permit.
[00:18:17.091 --> 00:18:19.893]  And that means a lot of them are going to get evicted to Gaza.
[00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:20.414]  No, no, no.
[00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:22.615]  That's how it works in America now with zoning.
[00:18:22.916 --> 00:18:24.497]  They're just taking people's property and land.
[00:18:24.537 --> 00:18:28.760]  And the thing is, they know that when Israel does this, a new war is going to start.
[00:18:29.521 --> 00:18:32.123]  And it's just out of control.
[00:18:33.104 --> 00:18:36.907]  And I thought this needed to be brought up because it was important.
[00:18:36.987 --> 00:18:39.028]  It is what they call ethnic cleansing.
[00:18:39.889 --> 00:18:41.370]  And it's big and it needed to be said.
[00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:42.351]  That being said,
[00:18:42.972 --> 00:18:52.501]  My question is, if I wanted to see the PNAC documents, and if I wanted to see State Department Memorandum 200 and...
[00:18:54.845 --> 00:18:58.606]  Where do I go to see those documents?
[00:18:58.646 --> 00:19:00.407]  It's all at the Library of Congress.
[00:19:01.047 --> 00:19:04.728]  It's all at the National Security Archive.
[00:19:05.328 --> 00:19:09.369]  PNAC had its website up until about two years ago.
[00:19:09.969 --> 00:19:16.451]  I mean it's been in thousands, tens of thousands of news articles have been written about the Project for a New American Century.
[00:19:17.191 --> 00:19:18.672]  So you'll just use a search engine.
[00:19:19.552 --> 00:19:24.996]  And there's hundreds of documents they wrote, battle plans, against the American people and the world.
[00:19:26.317 --> 00:19:27.238]  Top neocons.
[00:19:27.718 --> 00:19:33.182]  But what you want to search is, rebuilding America's defenses September 20th, 2000.
[00:19:34.743 --> 00:19:35.224]  PNAC.
[00:19:35.944 --> 00:19:38.326]  Rebuilding America's defenses September 20th, 2000.
[00:19:40.427 --> 00:19:40.847]  PNAC.
[00:19:41.648 --> 00:19:51.353]  And that will give you one of the more vicious reports where Cheney talks about race-specific bioweapons, where he talks about we need a new Pearl Harbor event to launch the war.
[00:19:53.935 --> 00:19:54.855]  It's totally sick.
[00:19:55.376 --> 00:19:56.096]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:56.136 --> 00:19:56.797]  Thank you for the call.
[00:19:56.817 --> 00:19:57.197]  Stay with us.
[00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:03.110]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.311]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:06.191]  Don't!
[00:20:06.631 --> 00:20:09.652]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:20:10.073 --> 00:20:17.195]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:18.836]  's number one debt secret.
[00:20:19.156 --> 00:20:22.817]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:20:23.237 --> 00:20:25.940]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:33.409]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:20:33.749 --> 00:20:34.730]  Herb K was right.
[00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:37.974]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:20:38.134 --> 00:20:39.175]  What have you got to lose?
[00:20:39.555 --> 00:20:40.555]  Stop the calls now!
[00:20:40.835 --> 00:20:42.536]  Get out of debt and have more money!
[00:20:42.857 --> 00:20:43.617]  Get Herb K.'
[00:20:43.557 --> 00:20:45.938]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now!
[00:20:46.098 --> 00:20:46.439]  Call 800-822-1291.
[00:20:46.739 --> 00:20:47.279]  That's 800-822-1291.
[00:20:47.299 --> 00:20:47.339]  800-822-1291.
[00:20:59.717 --> 00:21:02.000]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.303]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:04.423 --> 00:21:07.267]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:07.627 --> 00:21:12.373]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:12.734 --> 00:21:16.939]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:17.239 --> 00:21:19.582]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:19.702 --> 00:21:22.106]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:22.126 --> 00:21:25.049]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:33.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:38.585]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:38.705 --> 00:21:41.508]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:41.568 --> 00:21:45.012]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:45.252 --> 00:21:46.173]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:46.333 --> 00:21:47.234]  You're everyone else.

[00:22:02.474 --> 00:22:07.659]  Not the change we were promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in these changing economic times.
[00:22:07.879 --> 00:22:13.244]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion, and our unfunded liabilities totaling over $107 trillion,
[00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:15.465]  The value of the U.S.
[00:22:15.485 --> 00:22:17.406]  dollar continues its slide into oblivion.
[00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:22.028]  There's still time to ensure your financial security with precious metals, but you need to act today.

[00:22:31.431 --> 00:22:39.694]  With our government continuing to find new ways to spend our money at the expense of our children and grandchildren, there's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation with Precious Metals.
[00:22:39.934 --> 00:22:50.997]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we'll discuss how you can take physical possession or convert your IRA into Precious Metals before it's too late.
[00:22:51.017 --> 00:22:58.280]  800-686-2237, extension 104, and make the commitment today to retain the security you worked a lifetime to establish.
[00:22:58.971 --> 00:23:01.533]  Times are tough and you gotta stretch that dollar.

[00:24:11.696 --> 00:24:24.727]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:26.788]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[00:24:27.729 --> 00:24:29.470]  Let's talk to Fred in Oklahoma.
[00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:30.271]  Fred, you're on the air.
[00:24:31.392 --> 00:24:32.553]  Alex, how are you, sir?
[00:24:33.193 --> 00:24:36.036]  I'm doing pretty good because we're having a lot of victories against the New World Order.
[00:24:37.299 --> 00:24:43.085]  August of 2009, last year, William Jefferson Clinton had a sit-down with Kim Jong-il.
[00:24:43.785 --> 00:24:45.928]  You don't think he went on a little shopping spree over there, do you?
[00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:49.091]  You know, I don't think they need to shop.
[00:24:49.131 --> 00:24:57.999]  They've got plenty of nukes over here and we already caught Cheney trying to sneak out some cruise missiles, what, three years ago out of the Dakotas.
[00:24:59.661 --> 00:25:01.543]  But who knows what was going on with that meeting.
[00:25:02.318 --> 00:25:05.702]  They can trace that stuff down to the element and where it was processed.
[00:25:06.062 --> 00:25:09.245]  Now, they would need that to be processed somewhere other than the United States.
[00:25:10.086 --> 00:25:21.679]  Now, if they let one of those things off, say, in Iraq or Afghanistan, and then later, a year later, they come to find out that it was processed in North Korea, they've got the pretense to the next war.
[00:25:22.759 --> 00:25:23.961]  Well that's another issue.
[00:25:24.181 --> 00:25:28.586]  Some of the uranium has been processed for Iran in Russia and France.
[00:25:28.606 --> 00:25:37.097]  So that's another way they could separately sell some of that to whatever private corporation or black ops group or intelligence agency was going to stage it.
[00:25:37.317 --> 00:25:38.939]  But they can also fake
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.082]  I mean, they don't need to actually frame someone that way.
[00:25:42.122 --> 00:25:42.722]  I disagree with you.
[00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:04.559]  All right, sir.
[00:26:04.579 --> 00:26:12.985]  Well, like I said, it was just an idea, and thanks for all you do, and I'm a value listener, and I try to pass the message on to anybody who'll listen.
[00:26:13.205 --> 00:26:15.287]  Well, Fred, let me add, I mean, you've got a good point.
[00:26:15.387 --> 00:26:23.232]  I mean, certainly they could buy it from a third party in Eastern Europe, in Central Asia, out of Russia, from North Korea.
[00:26:23.272 --> 00:26:24.393]  That's a really good point.
[00:26:24.633 --> 00:26:27.896]  I mean, they could do it, so they legitimately frame somebody
[00:26:28.536 --> 00:26:34.541]  And they can prove and not fake the test and then show that it came from somewhere that it really didn't.
[00:26:35.021 --> 00:26:38.704]  My issue is they can also fake evidence, fake forensics.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.122]  Yes, and they've done it before.
[00:26:43.963 --> 00:26:44.644]  They've done it before.
[00:26:44.704 --> 00:26:46.045]  The sky's the limit with these people.
[00:26:46.325 --> 00:26:52.732]  And look, there's a lot of terror groups that it comes out later, for decades, didn't know they were being run by Western intelligence.
[00:26:52.772 --> 00:26:54.954]  I mean, it came out in a few major U.S.
[00:26:54.995 --> 00:26:59.980]  newspapers, what, a week and a half ago, that the head of the Mumbai attacks was a U.S.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.481]  government agent running the operation.
[00:27:01.501 --> 00:27:02.482]  That came out in federal court.
[00:27:03.143 --> 00:27:09.927]  Just like it came out, one of the top white supremacists in the country was actually an FBI agent, Hal Turner, at national security level.
[00:27:10.548 --> 00:27:15.431]  I mean, it's just, it's so incredible that they just run.
[00:27:15.451 --> 00:27:19.933]  I'm hoping they bust somebody sometime that doesn't work for the globalists.
[00:27:20.013 --> 00:27:21.935]  I wish it was just ragtag terrorists.
[00:27:22.315 --> 00:27:26.237]  I'm not scared of ragtag terrorists, but I am concerned about the New World Order.
[00:27:27.958 --> 00:27:29.479]  Let's talk to Ken in South Carolina.
[00:27:29.499 --> 00:27:30.160]  Ken, you're on the air.
[00:27:34.424 --> 00:27:41.331]  First of all, I want to thank you for telling the truth and giving the small people like me a chance to tell the truth to other people.
[00:27:41.812 --> 00:27:45.896]  Just how many people I've woken up, I can't thank you enough.
[00:27:47.338 --> 00:27:47.838]  Are you kidding?
[00:27:47.898 --> 00:27:48.619]  I can't thank you.
[00:27:48.639 --> 00:27:49.900]  We're all in this together, my friend.
[00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:08.130]  They had the underground bunkers.
[00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:10.011]  We know they had the Denver Airport.
[00:28:10.311 --> 00:28:12.092]  We've got the FEMA coffins lined up.
[00:28:12.672 --> 00:28:15.914]  Isn't that like a huge sign that something is coming very soon?
[00:28:15.934 --> 00:28:18.715]  It's a perfect way to roll out the police state.
[00:28:18.735 --> 00:28:19.835]  They've already got lined up.
[00:28:19.896 --> 00:28:23.437]  It's like football teams already lined up and the quarterback's going, Blue 42!
[00:28:23.517 --> 00:28:24.057]  Blue 42!
[00:28:24.117 --> 00:28:24.418]  Huh!
[00:28:24.478 --> 00:28:25.038]  Huh!
[00:28:25.438 --> 00:28:25.958]  Huh!
[00:28:26.679 --> 00:28:27.999]  And I mean, they are ready to go.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:45.152]  Again, they have a history of staging stuff, they're hyping it, it will help them, it's one of the cards, they're looking at playing, and that's why they're so mad at 9-11 Truth, because now they've got to worry about a populace that's got their eyes wide open, and who's looking for things.
[00:28:45.592 --> 00:28:51.596]  Like 9-11 Truth or Kurt Haskell, who exposed their entire underwear bombing, and it turned out he was right!
[00:28:52.137 --> 00:28:53.958]  See, we've got our people are everywhere now!
[00:28:54.358 --> 00:28:54.999]  You understand that?
[00:28:55.643 --> 00:28:57.764]  Well, you know, they said they wanted depopulation.
[00:28:57.784 --> 00:28:59.245]  Now they can just ship whoever's left.
[00:28:59.445 --> 00:29:01.206]  Is that what they feel?
[00:29:03.588 --> 00:29:04.228]  Absolutely.
[00:29:04.328 --> 00:29:11.292]  And again, they can set off a dinky nuke that just blows up maybe 20, 30 square blocks, radiates part of a city.
[00:29:11.613 --> 00:29:13.394]  They'll come in, mop it up, clean it up.
[00:29:13.874 --> 00:29:17.896]  And if you think 9-11 drove a stake through our heart, a nuclear 9-11
[00:29:19.554 --> 00:29:23.876]  ...will be a whole order or two of magnitude increased.
[00:29:23.996 --> 00:29:27.737]  Key points that you made, Ken, I appreciate your call.
[00:29:28.057 --> 00:29:35.640]  Francis, Nathaniel, Keith and others, the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:36.381 --> 00:29:40.682]  You have found it, ladies and gentlemen, the tip of the spear, the front lines in the Info War.
[00:29:41.223 --> 00:29:46.885]  More straight ahead in this wartime broadcast in the battle for free humanity and the Republic.
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.043]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.983 --> 00:29:56.746]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.988 --> 00:30:02.591]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:07.975]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:08.335 --> 00:30:10.077]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:10.377 --> 00:30:15.201]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:15.381 --> 00:30:16.342]  How much do you want?
[00:30:16.562 --> 00:30:17.303]  When do you want it?
[00:30:17.663 --> 00:30:19.285]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:19.566 --> 00:30:20.387]  When will you need it?
[00:30:20.627 --> 00:30:22.710]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:23.952]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:24.172 --> 00:30:25.514]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:25.714 --> 00:30:30.781]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:30.981 --> 00:30:34.106]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:34.546 --> 00:30:38.049]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:39.350]  How much will you need?
[00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:40.210]  We don't know.
[00:30:40.491 --> 00:30:41.411]  How much do you want?
[00:30:41.611 --> 00:30:42.332]  All you can get.
[00:30:42.352 --> 00:30:43.373]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:43.633 --> 00:30:46.395]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:46.675 --> 00:30:48.437]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:48.457 --> 00:30:49.377]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:59.318 --> 00:31:00.299]  What's your home worth?
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.422]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:31:02.602 --> 00:31:05.346]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:31:05.646 --> 00:31:13.175]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[00:31:13.376 --> 00:31:16.800]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[00:31:46.657 --> 00:31:49.481]  That's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[00:31:49.621 --> 00:31:57.692]  Look for Max, the Orange Home Gain Gorilla, to help you find a realtor or with any other real estate needs you might have at HomeGain.com, your real estate connection.
[00:31:58.826 --> 00:32:01.107]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:32:01.127 --> 00:32:03.429]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:32:03.529 --> 00:32:06.330]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:11.493]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:32:11.833 --> 00:32:16.055]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:32:16.356 --> 00:32:18.597]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:32:18.817 --> 00:32:21.258]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:32:21.579 --> 00:32:24.140]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:32.105]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:32:32.425 --> 00:32:37.728]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:32:37.828 --> 00:32:40.110]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:44.072]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:32:44.352 --> 00:32:45.292]  And I got news for you.
[00:32:45.432 --> 00:32:46.733]  You're everyone else.
[00:32:46.753 --> 00:32:47.753]  Invisible Empire.

[00:33:04.879 --> 00:33:11.961]  Oh oppression, you prey on us when we sleep.
[00:33:12.984 --> 00:33:32.431]  Okay, I'm going to systematically cover the top news stories in the next 30 minutes.
[00:33:32.471 --> 00:33:34.572]  Tarpley's only joining us for 15, Watson for 15.
[00:33:35.012 --> 00:33:37.413]  We'll take calls coming up in the next hour.
[00:33:37.433 --> 00:33:38.754]  If callers want to hold, you can hold.
[00:33:38.794 --> 00:33:39.614]  If not, you can call back.
[00:33:41.013 --> 00:33:45.095]  I'm going to systematically go through a bunch of important news here in just a moment.
[00:33:46.296 --> 00:33:53.480]  Before I do that, I want to thank a couple of sponsors that have made this radio show possible, and I also believe in.
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.502]  One of them is MySolarBackup.com.
[00:33:56.602 --> 00:33:58.183]  One word, MySolarBackup.com.
[00:33:58.223 --> 00:34:01.345]  Links up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:02.365 --> 00:34:09.150]  This is a plug and play solar generators available from our wonderful sponsors Solutions from Science and they've been selling these on our show for two years.
[00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:10.071]  Our listeners love them.
[00:34:10.091 --> 00:34:11.112]  I've gotten great feedback.
[00:34:11.692 --> 00:34:19.158]  These portable power systems need no installation and supply household current wherever and whenever you need it, producing electricity directly from the sun.
[00:34:19.198 --> 00:34:22.480]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly and emits no fumes.
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:27.023]  It's like having your own electric power plant and it's perfect for your home or your campsite.
[00:34:27.384 --> 00:34:27.784]  So whether it's
[00:34:28.064 --> 00:34:30.525]  Hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, blackouts, you name it.
[00:34:31.105 --> 00:34:33.646]  Or all this greenhouse gas tax garbage.
[00:34:34.126 --> 00:34:35.567]  You need to start moving off the grid.
[00:34:35.587 --> 00:34:42.389]  A great way to do it is mysolarbackup.com or call for a free information package at 877-327-0365.
[00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:42.629]  877-327-0365.
[00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:50.071]  And one other sponsor I want to tell you about is the best, purest, cleanest drinking water you're going to find anywhere.
[00:34:50.852 --> 00:34:52.032]  You know, clouds are made out of water.
[00:34:52.332 --> 00:34:53.353]  And that's what this does.
[00:34:53.393 --> 00:34:56.694]  It grabs water out of the atmosphere in your house, your business, your
[00:34:58.684 --> 00:35:02.808]  Your work shack, your tinkering shack, your work shed, whatever.
[00:35:03.709 --> 00:35:07.173]  And it grabs it, and the smaller units produce 7 plus gallons.
[00:35:07.193 --> 00:35:08.975]  They've got them that produce hundreds of gallons a day.
[00:35:08.995 --> 00:35:16.583]  They're very affordable, and it sends them through 7 to 12 different filters depending on which unit you buy, as if you need a bunch of filters when it's right out of the air.
[00:35:16.603 --> 00:35:18.364]  The point is, it's really great water.
[00:35:19.485 --> 00:35:30.310]  And you can find out more at acolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com, acolablue.com, bannersuponinfowars.com, or give them a call, 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043, acolablue.com.
[00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:30.430]  Okay.
[00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.711]  Let me try to calmly and systematically go over the news right now.
[00:35:49.597 --> 00:35:51.739]  Since the 40s and 50s, the U.S.
[00:35:51.919 --> 00:35:56.624]  government, in a staged event, now has been declassified.
[00:35:57.645 --> 00:36:00.447]  You heard Jesse Ventura talking about it when he was on with us last week.
[00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:15.001]  We had a deal with the Russians after World War II, with Joe Stalin, that he would attack a bunch of third world countries, we would claim we were opposing him, and then
[00:36:17.096 --> 00:36:20.759]  We would attack and invade countries, and then he would claim he was opposing us.
[00:36:21.699 --> 00:36:32.087]  Remember what Adolf Alois Hitler did with the Russian-Nazi pact that was signed, what, in 1939?
[00:36:34.288 --> 00:36:35.769]  They divided Poland.
[00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.750]  A sneak attack.
[00:36:37.311 --> 00:36:38.491]  From the east, the Russians.
[00:36:39.532 --> 00:36:41.013]  From the west, the Germans.
[00:36:43.095 --> 00:36:43.255]  Well,
[00:36:45.612 --> 00:36:53.898]  The CIA and others at the end of World War II, the OSS, and Fletcher Prouty was the head of Black Ops, wrote about this, but now large portions have been declassified.
[00:36:54.518 --> 00:36:55.879]  They put Mao Zedong in.
[00:36:55.899 --> 00:36:57.100]  That's now even on History Channel.
[00:36:58.101 --> 00:36:59.302]  Kick Chiang Kai-shek out.
[00:37:00.803 --> 00:37:03.605]  But the genius of this was, the U.S.
[00:37:03.645 --> 00:37:05.006]  just can't go invade countries.
[00:37:06.947 --> 00:37:08.489]  Because the people wouldn't put up with that.
[00:37:08.529 --> 00:37:14.293]  We were Christian, educated, informed patriots who knew what George Washington said.
[00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:17.251]  See, here's the problem.
[00:37:17.291 --> 00:37:24.536]  I'm trying to get into fake nuclear false flag, and then I start going through my mental process of how I understand all this.
[00:37:25.096 --> 00:37:25.977]  It's just impossible.
[00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:27.878]  There's just so much information.
[00:37:28.538 --> 00:37:34.223]  So what would happen is, they'd pick Korea, or they'd pick Vietnam, or they'd pick another country.
[00:37:35.063 --> 00:37:37.624]  And they'd say, we're gonna invade here, you're gonna invade there.
[00:37:37.944 --> 00:37:42.506]  That'll allow us to make a lot of money and get control of society through weapons sales.
[00:37:42.966 --> 00:37:46.347]  It will allow us to create a paramilitary force that we can then use domestically.
[00:37:46.647 --> 00:37:51.089]  It'll give us battle-hardened troops in these wartime laboratories, as they're called.
[00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:54.870]  And so, you take half of Germany, we take the other half.
[00:37:55.471 --> 00:37:56.251]  After World War II.
[00:37:56.851 --> 00:37:58.892]  You take half of Korea, we take the other half.
[00:38:00.725 --> 00:38:03.668]  We take part of Vietnam, you take the other half, and then we kill each other.
[00:38:04.409 --> 00:38:13.458]  But we use that as a political diversion because if the Russians are at war against the Americans, the Russians can oppress their people because they're in a war.
[00:38:13.558 --> 00:38:17.101]  And the people go, we've got to do what the commissars say, we're in a war.
[00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:19.063]  Same thing in America.
[00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:21.645]  And it was when
[00:38:23.072 --> 00:38:26.174]  And again, this has even been in the New York Times, you know, the headline, McCarthy was right.
[00:38:26.194 --> 00:38:27.315]  Well, that was about four years ago.
[00:38:27.375 --> 00:38:29.097]  The Russians declassified that it was all true.
[00:38:29.137 --> 00:38:30.137]  McCarthy was completely right.
[00:38:30.378 --> 00:38:30.798]  The U.S.
[00:38:30.878 --> 00:38:35.521]  Army was basically funding the communists in Russia, ran the whole thing, gave them nukes, gave them everything.
[00:38:35.922 --> 00:38:44.728]  McCarthy was great when he was targeting Hollywood people to create a censorship system and an excuse to set up spies and police state.
[00:38:45.169 --> 00:38:50.593]  But when he found out that it was all run by the Pentagon, politically, they slit his throat.
[00:38:52.844 --> 00:38:54.949]  That's how sophisticated this is!
[00:38:57.423 --> 00:38:58.824]  And it's the same thing with Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:59.144 --> 00:39:07.970]  How does the banking cartel that dominates and controls the West, when the French, the British, the Americans, we don't want to go invade and kill brown people.
[00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.051]  We don't want to pay for wars.
[00:39:09.371 --> 00:39:10.973]  We don't want to send our sons and daughters off.
[00:39:11.013 --> 00:39:12.233]  We'll fight in a righteous war.
[00:39:12.874 --> 00:39:15.996]  We'll fight today if we're being attacked or invaded.
[00:39:16.416 --> 00:39:19.198]  So they stage a terror attack.
[00:39:19.679 --> 00:39:24.022]  Then they hype it as a pretext to continue and expand those wars.
[00:39:25.359 --> 00:39:28.661]  Now they're going to stage racist events at tea parties, and they've been caught doing it.
[00:39:29.081 --> 00:39:31.682]  Now they're going to stage terror attacks and blame it on conservatives.
[00:39:32.082 --> 00:39:36.125]  All you conservatives that bought into this under Bush, now you're going to get the other end of it.
[00:39:37.485 --> 00:39:38.806]  You better grow up right now.
[00:39:39.486 --> 00:39:40.667]  There's not time for this!
[00:39:42.448 --> 00:39:46.850]  Stalin captured 22,000 US troops in 1945 in Germany.
[00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:47.751]  This is declassified.
[00:39:47.791 --> 00:39:48.371]  This is public.
[00:39:50.732 --> 00:39:52.093]  And he said, I want them for slave labor.
[00:39:52.253 --> 00:39:53.754]  And Eisenhower said, sure, go ahead.
[00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:59.013]  That's what the government thinks of our troops in 1945.
[00:40:01.394 --> 00:40:02.335]  He was the head general.
[00:40:02.555 --> 00:40:06.617]  He actually complained about it, but Roosevelt, well then it was Harry Truman, said go ahead.
[00:40:07.077 --> 00:40:10.640]  The point is, that's how ruthless these people are.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:17.624]  You think Harry Truman didn't care about hundreds of thousands of Japanese they killed with A-bombs when Japan was already trying to unconditionally surrender?
[00:40:20.646 --> 00:40:27.427]  They did that basically like the Death Star blowing up Alderaan in Star Wars to show people the power of the Empire.
[00:40:27.447 --> 00:40:32.588]  Again, using a pop culture analogy for people.
[00:40:37.629 --> 00:40:38.929]  This is how they operate.
[00:40:40.469 --> 00:40:41.410]  This is what they do.
[00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:48.871]  You think if they don't care about hundreds of thousands of Japanese they killed on one day, mainly women and children, do you then think
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.681]  That they're going to care about 22,000 or 21,000 U.S.
[00:40:53.022 --> 00:40:53.282]  troops?
[00:40:53.682 --> 00:40:55.103]  Oh, Stalin said, I'm going to keep them.
[00:40:55.123 --> 00:40:56.283]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:40:56.603 --> 00:40:56.864]  U.S.
[00:40:56.904 --> 00:40:58.184]  soldiers in Nazi camps?
[00:40:58.605 --> 00:40:59.385]  Go ahead and take them.
[00:41:01.406 --> 00:41:03.407]  Now, you remember that cops and military.
[00:41:03.667 --> 00:41:05.468]  And don't sit there and tell me it isn't true.
[00:41:05.868 --> 00:41:12.412]  Don't you dare, in sitting there in your ignorance, neck deep in the cess of your ignorance,
[00:41:13.467 --> 00:41:19.472]  With all sorts of detritus floating around you in your ignorant brain, don't you sit there and say I'm making that up, punk!
[00:41:20.132 --> 00:41:23.475]  I'm talking to you out there that are in denial, that think you're patriots.
[00:41:23.515 --> 00:41:26.497]  You go look up what I just told you and find out it's true!
[00:41:28.539 --> 00:41:30.620]  Don't you just sit there and say I'm lying about it!
[00:41:34.123 --> 00:41:34.603]  Face it!
[00:41:35.737 --> 00:41:37.220]  You mean nothing to these people!
[00:41:37.841 --> 00:41:38.202]  Nothing.
[00:41:38.883 --> 00:41:39.224]  Nothing.
[00:41:39.765 --> 00:41:40.106]  Nothing.
[00:41:40.687 --> 00:41:41.007]  Nothing.
[00:41:41.448 --> 00:41:43.733]  You're with us, the people, whether you know it or like it.
[00:41:45.676 --> 00:41:47.159]  So again, I'll tell you, choose sides.
[00:41:50.012 --> 00:41:51.594]  I have studied the enemy's blueprints.
[00:41:51.654 --> 00:41:53.516]  I have studied their declassified documents.
[00:41:53.596 --> 00:41:54.597]  I know how their mind works.
[00:41:54.637 --> 00:41:55.197]  Think about that.
[00:41:55.618 --> 00:41:58.260]  They get with the Russians and they say, how do we carve up the world together?
[00:41:58.841 --> 00:42:00.983]  We've been allies throughout this war with the Nazis.
[00:42:01.483 --> 00:42:03.005]  We want to create collectivism too.
[00:42:03.025 --> 00:42:06.788]  In fact, the bankers that run America funded your predecessor, Lenin.
[00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:09.071]  How do we get this done?
[00:42:11.055 --> 00:42:23.921]  And their psych warfare experts came in and said, you set up a police state and collectivism under the name of fighting communism, and then we invade countries under the name of fighting you, and then you invade, and then we always divide the land between each other.
[00:42:25.782 --> 00:42:32.925]  That's why there's a deal to give the communist Chinese in 1979 the Panama Canal when we built it, for no reason.
[00:42:33.125 --> 00:42:34.626]  Wouldn't even let US companies bid on it.
[00:42:35.728 --> 00:42:41.930]  That's why they give the communist Chinese and the Russians the drilling rights off our coast, but won't give our own companies that.
[00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:44.771]  That's why they give tax incentives for U.S.
[00:42:44.811 --> 00:42:46.091]  companies to leave and go to China.
[00:42:46.652 --> 00:42:49.633]  This is all a master plan that is stated.
[00:42:52.634 --> 00:42:53.194]  That's the thing.
[00:42:53.234 --> 00:42:57.595]  I mean, thousands and thousands and thousands of their blueprints have fallen into our hands.
[00:42:57.935 --> 00:42:59.236]  That's what's so frustrating here.
[00:42:59.596 --> 00:43:00.936]  This is not our opinion.
[00:43:01.917 --> 00:43:02.877]  It's got to stop.
[00:43:10.355 --> 00:43:11.076]  So here's the deal.
[00:43:11.396 --> 00:43:16.540]  Since the 40s and 50s, they have been teaching everybody we're going to be nuked as an excuse to set up a police state.
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.661]  And they've ingrained that in our psyche.
[00:43:19.182 --> 00:43:27.088]  And I've seen thousands of different factors coinciding in a political future vortex.
[00:43:30.111 --> 00:43:34.894]  And this isn't mumbo-jumbo, this is political deep research integrating all the information.
[00:43:38.495 --> 00:43:44.739]  Thousands of points that go into it, that there is a distinct possibility, and I've been saying this for many years,
[00:43:46.149 --> 00:43:49.752]  That the establishment will stage a nuclear 9-11.
[00:43:50.032 --> 00:43:53.555]  And now they've been hyping it for eight years, saying it's not a question of if, but when.
[00:43:53.936 --> 00:44:03.184]  Nukes go off, and the CFR has even bragged and said, Al-Qaeda will probably hit Denver, Dallas, Cleveland, and one other city.
[00:44:05.165 --> 00:44:06.406]  That's meant to scare their buddies.
[00:44:07.066 --> 00:44:16.271]  When the CFR members, Gary Hart, Warren Rudman and others, get up and predict an attack on the World Trade Center, and then a police state will follow for our own good, that's showing off.
[00:44:16.331 --> 00:44:17.792]  And that's why they all gasp.
[00:44:18.032 --> 00:44:26.697]  Whenever, a month ago, Bill Gates got up and said, carbon dioxide's what humans put out, we've got to cut the human population, everyone gasped and giggled and clapped.
[00:44:26.977 --> 00:44:28.498]  It was like a little demonic celebration.
[00:44:28.898 --> 00:44:30.699]  Oh, we're here on the inside group.
[00:44:30.799 --> 00:44:32.580]  Ooh, we feel powerful.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.001]  It's our little power fetish.
[00:44:35.981 --> 00:44:39.883]  Talking about killing people in mass!
[00:44:40.183 --> 00:44:41.643]  We're a control freak cult!
[00:44:43.324 --> 00:44:49.425]  And Gates all got this demonic smile and like was just shivering with... I'm giving all my money to kill people!
[00:44:50.506 --> 00:44:52.586]  And I'm telling him it's to help them!
[00:44:53.126 --> 00:44:58.268]  I mean I have to sit here and see these psychopaths in big, big groups
[00:44:58.268 --> 00:45:00.550]  I have to watch all this happening to you?
[00:45:00.711 --> 00:45:00.991]  Every day?
[00:45:17.972 --> 00:45:19.353]  Knowing how real it is?
[00:45:19.713 --> 00:45:21.294]  Knowing it's 110%?
[00:45:21.954 --> 00:45:23.855]  So indescribable I can't even tell you!
[00:45:24.075 --> 00:45:25.196]  People think I'm exaggerating.
[00:45:25.216 --> 00:45:26.736]  You have no idea how bad it is!
[00:45:27.477 --> 00:45:29.177]  I said I'd cover news and I'm not doing it, am I?
[00:45:29.758 --> 00:45:33.199]  I'm just ranting because it's just so fundamental.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:40.263]  Once you get wicked people in government, once you get corrupt
[00:45:42.415 --> 00:45:51.147]  Systems in they just recruit more and more evil and then they compete with each other and it gets more and more wicked more and more Sadistic more and more psychopathic that's history folks.
[00:45:51.588 --> 00:45:52.929]  It's it's high-tech.
[00:45:52.989 --> 00:45:54.572]  It's here a high-tech overlay
[00:46:03.655 --> 00:46:04.856]  They want to invade Iran.
[00:46:04.896 --> 00:46:06.577]  They want to set up a domestic police state.
[00:46:07.057 --> 00:46:09.399]  They want to be able to steal the pension funds during the crisis.
[00:46:09.619 --> 00:46:15.803]  They've got the mobile checkpoint processing units with the body scanners and brain scanners rolling out.
[00:46:15.843 --> 00:46:17.404]  We've shown you the Homeland Security videos.
[00:46:17.824 --> 00:46:22.928]  They want to fully federalize everything and give the federal contracts to a select group of corporations.
[00:46:23.768 --> 00:46:25.529]  And they need a nuke attack.
[00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:29.692]  If I was them, and I'm able to step into their battle
[00:46:31.653 --> 00:46:32.374]  Command system.
[00:46:32.434 --> 00:46:38.123]  I can see what they're doing, the different plays they've got, the different options, the different programs.
[00:46:39.744 --> 00:46:41.205]  And if you study this, you can too.
[00:46:41.585 --> 00:46:48.288]  And I can step into their worldview and how they think, and I can tell you they've got a fistful of cards.
[00:46:48.768 --> 00:46:52.870]  And they've got that nuke, false flag nuke attack right there in their hand.
[00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:55.211]  Do they just type it as a psychological threat?
[00:46:55.491 --> 00:46:56.251]  They're already doing that.
[00:46:56.791 --> 00:46:57.652]  They've already played that.
[00:46:58.652 --> 00:47:02.394]  Do they bust somebody, some patsies, and claim that they had a nuke?
[00:47:05.367 --> 00:47:06.527]  Because the people are waking up to them.
[00:47:06.567 --> 00:47:07.687]  They need something spectacular.
[00:47:08.448 --> 00:47:11.068]  Or do they detonate one weapon?
[00:47:11.468 --> 00:47:12.288]  Multiple weapons?
[00:47:14.649 --> 00:47:16.609]  Why is the government committing political suicide?
[00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:21.270]  In a republic, in a representative system, they're all going to be out of office.
[00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:22.551]  Why don't they care?
[00:47:22.911 --> 00:47:24.871]  Why do they just rush forward on every front?
[00:47:25.351 --> 00:47:25.651]  Why?
[00:47:29.752 --> 00:47:31.512]  Because they know they've got the ace in the hole.
[00:47:32.393 --> 00:47:33.353]  They've got the royal flush.
[00:47:33.373 --> 00:47:34.093]  They've got nukes.
[00:47:35.299 --> 00:47:45.664]  And as another card, to suppress their political enemies, they're now teaching the school kids and the people on the news, everyone who doesn't like the Federal Reserve is a Nazi, hates black people.
[00:47:47.045 --> 00:47:50.226]  Anyone that talks about fluoride in your water is a Nazi and hates black people.
[00:47:50.566 --> 00:47:53.508]  Anybody that doesn't want government-run healthcare is a Nazi and hates black people.
[00:47:54.248 --> 00:47:59.691]  Makes no sense, until you realize the programming, and the brainwashed mass they're talking to.
[00:48:03.353 --> 00:48:03.653]  And so,
[00:48:05.014 --> 00:48:08.737]  We know they've already played the fake nuke card psychologically.
[00:48:09.098 --> 00:48:10.219]  Will they play it for real?
[00:48:10.659 --> 00:48:29.095]  I've been telling you for now several years that they are going to demonize the Patriot movement and now in the last year and a half the Tea Party movement and stage events and say you're terrorists and say you're white Al Qaeda and stage some fake raids on militias and people to create the illusion that there's this dangerous threat in the preparatory phase leading up to the staged event.
[00:48:32.634 --> 00:48:38.377]  And everything I was looking for, for them to do, has happened exactly as we said.
[00:48:38.437 --> 00:48:39.498]  Because it's a playbook!
[00:48:40.118 --> 00:48:42.359]  And I'm sitting here watching them run a playbook on us!
[00:48:46.642 --> 00:48:53.506]  And I know exactly what they're going to do, and I'm telling you, they're probably going to set nukes off.
[00:48:54.106 --> 00:48:54.526]  Okay?
[00:48:54.546 --> 00:48:55.467]  I just want you to know that.
[00:48:56.329 --> 00:49:06.736]  Unless we get the word out about false flag terror and all you good old boys that are scared of what your church is gonna say or scared of what your neighbor's gonna think, you better just stop caring what people think, okay?
[00:49:07.096 --> 00:49:07.977]  You better grow up.
[00:49:08.697 --> 00:49:18.864]  The first thing about being a man or being a woman and being a strong person is that when you're in the right and you know you're right, I don't care if I was on a stage with 10,000 people spitting at me and throwing tomatoes at me.
[00:49:19.585 --> 00:49:20.005]  I don't care.
[00:49:21.775 --> 00:49:26.916]  If I'm telling the truth, I don't care if they strip me butt-naked, march me out, and throw horse manure on me.
[00:49:27.096 --> 00:49:33.597]  I could care less, because I know I'm right, and I don't care what those cowards and people who aren't in the arena think.
[00:49:33.757 --> 00:49:35.758]  I could literally care less!
[00:49:38.858 --> 00:49:39.838]  Grow up, folks!
[00:49:40.739 --> 00:49:43.239]  In your gut, you know it's false flag, you know it's all staged.
[00:49:43.399 --> 00:49:47.680]  I got the Democrats and the AP staging racism events to blame it on us.
[00:49:50.489 --> 00:49:52.271]  That's all these people do is frame us!
[00:49:52.371 --> 00:49:54.452]  We're the good people, they're the scum!
[00:49:55.173 --> 00:49:58.076]  Look at their fruits, look at everything these controllers do!
[00:49:59.457 --> 00:50:05.262]  And then I hear Obama say, no longer are we worried about state-to-state nuclear war, country-to-country, we're worried about terror.
[00:50:05.522 --> 00:50:07.584]  And it's the number one threat facing the U.S.
[00:50:08.505 --> 00:50:13.209]  And they are the terrorists, so they're telling you, we are the terrorists, this is going to be our game plan.
[00:50:13.389 --> 00:50:16.552]  This is how we're going to reshuffle the world and relaunch our operation.
[00:50:19.048 --> 00:50:23.429]  And so, they're preparing to stage nuke attacks and blame it on Iran.
[00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:26.770]  It's like they claimed Saddam had nukes and was going to nuke us.
[00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:28.171]  People won't believe it this time.
[00:50:28.211 --> 00:50:29.391]  They've got to have a nuke attack.
[00:50:29.691 --> 00:50:35.993]  So I'm telling you, they've got the card in the poker game and they are just about to lay that card down.
[00:50:36.963 --> 00:50:39.484]  And we better say, hey, I'm not playing cards with you anymore.
[00:50:39.924 --> 00:50:41.444]  What's that coming out of your sleeve?
[00:50:41.784 --> 00:50:43.145]  Oh, look at that!
[00:50:43.185 --> 00:50:44.825]  Three decks of cards back in there!
[00:50:45.585 --> 00:50:47.626]  What in the world is going on here?
[00:50:48.346 --> 00:50:49.667]  It's a rigged game, folks.
[00:50:49.687 --> 00:50:51.107]  They got cards up their sleeves.
[00:50:51.347 --> 00:50:55.608]  They're the ones playing the terror cards, the race cards, the fake environmental cards.
[00:50:55.868 --> 00:50:57.869]  They're the ones putting the cards on the table!
[00:50:59.744 --> 00:51:03.605]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[00:51:03.665 --> 00:51:07.506]  My name is Van, and I'm 68 years old, and I live in Vermont.
[00:51:07.846 --> 00:51:12.328]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[00:51:12.588 --> 00:51:14.529]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[00:51:14.689 --> 00:51:15.969]  Made me feel breathless.
[00:51:16.389 --> 00:51:20.432]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[00:51:20.832 --> 00:51:21.873]  Nothing did anything.
[00:51:21.893 --> 00:51:25.876]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[00:51:25.896 --> 00:51:29.338]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[00:51:30.019 --> 00:51:32.700]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[00:51:33.121 --> 00:51:37.784]  The episodes became less frequent, and by a month I completely vanished.

[00:51:59.472 --> 00:52:01.814]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:01.854 --> 00:52:04.055]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:04.175 --> 00:52:06.997]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:07.377 --> 00:52:12.140]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:16.683]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.003 --> 00:52:19.325]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:19.345 --> 00:52:21.868]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:21.888 --> 00:52:24.810]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:25.151 --> 00:52:32.758]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:33.078 --> 00:52:38.362]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:38.462 --> 00:52:41.264]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.324 --> 00:52:44.767]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.007 --> 00:52:45.928]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:46.088 --> 00:52:47.389]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:47.429 --> 00:52:48.530]  Invisible Empire.

[00:52:59.119 --> 00:52:59.460]  Fact.
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:01.041]  Four million people in the U.S.
[00:53:01.061 --> 00:53:02.863]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:53:03.184 --> 00:53:03.504]  Fact.
[00:53:03.704 --> 00:53:07.068]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:53:07.389 --> 00:53:07.709]  Fact.
[00:53:08.009 --> 00:53:13.335]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:53:13.536 --> 00:53:13.796]  Fact.
[00:53:14.136 --> 00:53:17.997]  One in ten Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:53:18.337 --> 00:53:18.657]  Fact!
[00:53:18.917 --> 00:53:22.658]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[00:53:46.907 --> 00:53:48.088]  All the goodness with none of the side effects.
[00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:24.597]  But think about how asinine it is that a month ago it was declassified in major news that Dick Cheney ran the attack on the Russians in South Ossetia.
[00:54:25.217 --> 00:54:26.818]  And our news said the Russians had attacked.
[00:54:26.838 --> 00:54:29.980]  But it was all over the foreign news that Georgia had attacked.
[00:54:30.541 --> 00:54:31.521]  Then U.S.
[00:54:31.621 --> 00:54:43.409]  and NATO aircraft were flying in to back them up, and Russia rolled over the border with mobile nuke vehicles, with medium-range nukes, and their head general, their chairman of their joint chiefs, came on and said, we're preparing to nuke you.
[00:54:45.342 --> 00:54:59.711]  Cheney was testing them, seeing, I mean, he's a guy who's had five heart attacks, he's bored out of his mind, he's completely sadistic and crazy, and it's been declassified, he wanted to attack US ships using Navy SEALs to blame it on Iran.
[00:55:00.011 --> 00:55:02.973]  The exact same crew is in control right now over Obama.
[00:55:05.247 --> 00:55:06.327]  It's a big sick joke!
[00:55:07.248 --> 00:55:16.852]  They've looted us with the banks, they've looted us with the insurance companies, and then he says, oh, the greatest threat in the world is Al-Qaeda with nukes hitting the United States or other countries.
[00:55:17.353 --> 00:55:19.534]  And we've got to have a global regime to stop it, i.e.
[00:55:19.574 --> 00:55:24.656]  police state over everyone and all the borders, letting all the illegals in, but controlling the citizens.
[00:55:25.416 --> 00:55:26.497]  This is a global regime.
[00:55:26.677 --> 00:55:28.458]  We've got to have a global regime for the environment.
[00:55:29.078 --> 00:55:33.420]  Another secret document from the White House, the London Guardian reporting on it.
[00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:34.890]  Thank you.
[00:55:58.419 --> 00:56:00.060]  And environmentalism is their front.
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:02.121]  Again, it's another false flag.
[00:56:02.242 --> 00:56:03.382]  It isn't real.
[00:56:03.823 --> 00:56:12.928]  They pick carbon dioxide that all humans exhale, that's involved in all industry, all locomotion, everything, and they pick it so they can run every facet of your life.
[00:56:12.968 --> 00:56:14.349]  I mean, it's elementary.
[00:56:14.689 --> 00:56:15.990]  It's 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:56:16.531 --> 00:56:17.391]  It's not even 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:56:17.431 --> 00:56:17.771]  It's 1 plus 1.
[00:56:20.563 --> 00:56:24.186]  I mean, I've got a two-year-old, and I can say, what is one plus one?
[00:56:24.406 --> 00:56:26.047]  She goes, two, two.
[00:56:26.608 --> 00:56:30.211]  That sweet little voice, and I almost cry every time I look at her, knowing the world she lives in.
[00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:34.651]  But the public goes, I can't do 2 plus 2!
[00:56:35.451 --> 00:56:36.871]  I can't do 1 plus 1!
[00:56:37.611 --> 00:56:38.971]  I can't do anything!
[00:56:39.292 --> 00:56:41.012]  I just don't want to believe that, Alex.
[00:56:41.112 --> 00:56:42.212]  I just can't believe it.
[00:56:42.672 --> 00:56:45.013]  I just can't believe they're going to take our pension funds.
[00:56:45.093 --> 00:56:46.173]  I just can't believe it.
[00:56:46.273 --> 00:56:47.393]  I just can't believe it.
[00:56:47.993 --> 00:56:51.014]  I did see it on the news, but I just can't believe it.
[00:56:51.514 --> 00:56:53.635]  You better believe every stinking bit of it.
[00:56:54.895 --> 00:56:57.375]  They think you're a bunch of gullible morons.
[00:56:57.595 --> 00:56:59.936]  You know how risky it is for the black Congressional Congress?
[00:57:01.909 --> 00:57:08.213]  Caucus and Congress to go stage an event and claim they were called the N-word on video when they weren't, and claim they were spit on when they weren't.
[00:57:08.533 --> 00:57:12.416]  You know how risky it is for the Democratic Party to attack their own offices in Denver?
[00:57:12.556 --> 00:57:13.336]  That's Denver Post.
[00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:18.760]  You know how risky it is for them to have their people planted with N-word signs at Tea Parties?
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:20.541]  They don't care if they get caught!
[00:57:20.781 --> 00:57:23.863]  This is a group of revolutionary criminals that are going to do whatever they want!
[00:57:23.983 --> 00:57:26.965]  They're a bunch of blow-down, stinking snakes!
[00:57:27.405 --> 00:57:27.925]  Scum!
[00:57:28.325 --> 00:57:28.666]  Filth!
[00:57:29.884 --> 00:57:49.777]  And the Republican Party, Newt Gingrich, who supports value-added taxes and global greenhouse gas taxes, and is one of the PNAC masterminds of 9-11, running around talking about how he's fighting Obama, when Obama was put in power by his handlers, and he knows full well, it's all a bunch of theater!
[00:57:51.859 --> 00:57:53.500]  Now that's a little harder for people to get.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.701]  That's more like 5 plus 5 equals 10.
[00:57:59.992 --> 00:58:02.054]  When Watson comes on, we're going to get into all of this.
[00:58:02.154 --> 00:58:04.996]  Foes of Tea Party movement to infiltrate rallies.
[00:58:06.276 --> 00:58:08.378]  Tea Party agent provocateur outed.
[00:58:08.798 --> 00:58:09.379]  We outed him.
[00:58:10.039 --> 00:58:10.880]  Proud of our sites.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:11.720]  Now in the AP.
[00:58:12.301 --> 00:58:13.441]  No credit, of course, given to us.
[00:58:13.481 --> 00:58:14.102]  I could care less.
[00:58:15.243 --> 00:58:17.724]  And a lot more.
[00:58:20.426 --> 00:58:21.307]  But bottom line.
[00:58:23.476 --> 00:58:27.558]  They are infiltrating patriots to make us look racist, to make us look like terrorists.
[00:58:27.598 --> 00:58:28.639]  They are provocateuring.
[00:58:29.459 --> 00:58:34.162]  And you better be ready for it to only intensify in the coming months and years.
[00:58:34.502 --> 00:58:38.044]  And get the word out about false flag, that takes the power out of them.
[00:58:38.084 --> 00:58:44.127]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.527 --> 00:58:46.328]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.602 --> 00:58:50.743]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:50.783 --> 00:58:56.106]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:56.366 --> 00:59:00.989]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:01.389 --> 00:59:06.452]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:59:06.973 --> 00:59:11.675]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:12.196 --> 00:59:14.077]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:59:14.497 --> 00:59:19.098]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:19.298 --> 00:59:20.199]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:20.419 --> 00:59:23.179]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:26.760]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:29.941]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:30.281 --> 00:59:32.182]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:33.422]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:33.442 --> 00:59:33.622]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:41.304 --> 00:59:45.828]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:46.149 --> 00:59:48.591]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:52.595 --> 00:59:54.517]  Waging war on corruption.

[01:00:19.422 --> 01:00:27.646]  Okay, in 30 minutes, Paul Joseph Watson is joining us because Paul Watson, Kurt Nemo, and Steve Watson broke the news more than two weeks ago.
[01:00:28.686 --> 01:00:34.567]  That anarchist groups working for the Democratic Party were going to infiltrate Tea Parties and pose as racist.
[01:00:34.947 --> 01:00:40.269]  That's now in the AP with the name, we fingered, Jason Levin and others.
[01:00:41.189 --> 01:00:41.929]  That's coming up.
[01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:51.631]  Also, all over the country, from Texas to Ohio, they're shutting down police departments, cutting sheriff's departments by half and saying, you need to arm yourselves to protect yourself.
[01:00:52.011 --> 01:00:53.712]  Everything's going to the bankers now.
[01:00:53.832 --> 01:00:54.912]  Nothing for services.
[01:00:56.016 --> 01:01:00.880]  Economist, doctor of history, Webster Griffin-Tarpley joins us for this segment and part of the next.
[01:01:02.061 --> 01:01:05.063]  And then I'm going to continue into the news and then Watson's joining us.
[01:01:05.384 --> 01:01:13.410]  But I wanted to get him on about the Kaczynski twins and this mysterious downing Saturday of much of the Polish government's leadership.
[01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:14.711]  Is Russia behind it?
[01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:15.552]  Is NATO behind it?
[01:01:15.632 --> 01:01:17.533]  Or is it a malfunction?
[01:01:17.914 --> 01:01:18.974]  We talked to Colonel
[01:01:19.895 --> 01:01:20.135]  I don't
[01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:41.208]  That he was going to devalue their currency against the euro and start pulling out of the euro.
[01:01:41.428 --> 01:01:42.949]  If that happened, the euro would be dead.
[01:01:43.229 --> 01:01:47.950]  George Soros said that last week, and boom, the president and much of the leadership dies.
[01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:49.950]  Webster Tarpley, what's your take on this?
[01:01:51.131 --> 01:01:51.791]  Well, hi Alex.
[01:01:52.331 --> 01:01:54.552]  Obviously, it's a great tragedy.
[01:01:54.632 --> 01:02:06.455]  Now, in terms of who might be doing this, right, if we think that this was not just a plane crashing in the fog, on the surface, there are four attempts by the plane to land
[01:02:07.265 --> 01:02:09.667]  At a, uh, not well-developed airport, right?
[01:02:09.707 --> 01:02:17.093]  Smolensk is one of those European airports that doesn't have all the equipment for landing in fog, so usually you have to have visibility to land.
[01:02:17.453 --> 01:02:22.117]  They crash on the fourth approach after dumping a significant part of their fuel.
[01:02:22.888 --> 01:02:31.512]  And when the Russians were telling them, don't land here, go to Minsk or go to Moscow and then take some kind of ground transportation.
[01:02:31.552 --> 01:02:41.316]  But that, of course, would have made them miss this ceremony at the Katyn Forest and the commemoration of the 20,000 Polish officers massacred by Stalin.
[01:02:42.157 --> 01:02:44.117]  So, hypothetically, what could it be?
[01:02:45.198 --> 01:02:52.181]  This guy Kaczynski is a politician who built his house on Russophobia, on being anti-Russian.
[01:02:53.149 --> 01:02:55.049]  He was also anti-German.
[01:02:55.229 --> 01:02:57.310]  He picked all kinds of fights with Germany.
[01:02:57.410 --> 01:03:06.152]  He was always willing to pull out the tragic past of Poland vis-a-vis Russia, vis-a-vis Germany when he got into negotiations.
[01:03:06.912 --> 01:03:13.313]  And the thing that puts him in a better light is that he was also against the Lisbon Treaty.
[01:03:13.413 --> 01:03:22.015]  He was one of the last heads of state in Europe to sign this oppressive and oligarchical Lisbon Treaty that went into force.
[01:03:22.655 --> 01:03:23.336]  Last year.
[01:03:23.556 --> 01:03:26.538]  And as far as I know, Poland has not joined the Euro.
[01:03:26.578 --> 01:03:29.100]  They still have their own currency.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.244]  No, I know, but by dropping it, they say that would affect the Eurozone because it was pegged to the Euro.
[01:03:34.229 --> 01:03:40.931]  Yes, well, obviously when countries get into difficulty, it's very traditional and very standard to devalue the currency.
[01:03:41.012 --> 01:03:44.713]  In other words, if you have some kind of a debt crisis, you can devalue your currency.
[01:03:44.753 --> 01:03:54.116]  Most people would say, if Greece, for example, were not part of the Euro, they would simply devalue the drachma, which doesn't exist anymore, and that would be a way out for them.
[01:03:54.536 --> 01:04:01.119]  Devaluing the currency, though, means that the standard of living of the people goes down, because they get paid in zloty.
[01:04:01.779 --> 01:04:03.740]  And that means they can buy much less.
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:09.981]  It might mean that exports would be boosted, but the cost of living for the average person goes up.
[01:04:10.041 --> 01:04:16.043]  So let's not make anybody a hero about devaluing the bloody... I don't see... Well, I wasn't making him a hero.
[01:04:16.103 --> 01:04:18.603]  That's what they said that he was at odds with Europe about.
[01:04:18.643 --> 01:04:18.863]  Yeah.
[01:04:19.443 --> 01:04:19.804]  Sure.
[01:04:20.644 --> 01:04:23.624]  So, again, there are two possibilities.
[01:04:24.265 --> 01:04:25.305]  One is with Russia.
[01:04:26.025 --> 01:04:29.586]  He, of course, has given the Russians a hard time for many, many years.
[01:04:30.288 --> 01:04:38.192]  On the other hand, what he's gained by making him into a martyr, especially at the point where he's going to be leaving office in the autumn.
[01:04:38.252 --> 01:04:44.075]  In other words, his term is basically going to come to an end, and there's going to be a new election.
[01:04:44.255 --> 01:04:49.518]  So the West could have done that to get support for another Kaczynski guy to be put into power?
[01:04:50.719 --> 01:04:55.021]  It's possible, but again, he's on his way out, and the next guy is Komorowski from the Russian point of view.
[01:04:55.041 --> 01:04:55.982]  All right, stay there, stay there.
[01:04:56.022 --> 01:04:56.802]  Let's finish up.
[01:04:59.515 --> 01:05:04.803]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:05:04.823 --> 01:05:07.546]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:05:07.586 --> 01:05:12.073]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:05:12.914 --> 01:05:14.476]  Friends, I hope you will order.

[01:05:59.963 --> 01:06:02.566]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:02.967 --> 01:06:07.934]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:08.294 --> 01:06:10.036]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:10.337 --> 01:06:15.163]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:15.343 --> 01:06:16.325]  How much do you want?
[01:06:16.545 --> 01:06:17.266]  When do you want it?
[01:06:17.646 --> 01:06:19.247]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:19.527 --> 01:06:20.347]  When will you need it?
[01:06:20.587 --> 01:06:22.648]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:22.808 --> 01:06:23.908]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:24.128 --> 01:06:25.469]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:25.669 --> 01:06:30.731]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:30.931 --> 01:06:34.052]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:34.512 --> 01:06:38.015]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:38.336 --> 01:06:39.317]  How much will you need?
[01:06:39.557 --> 01:06:40.197]  We don't know.
[01:06:40.458 --> 01:06:41.378]  How much do you want?
[01:06:41.579 --> 01:06:42.299]  All you can get.
[01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:43.340]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.343]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:06:46.643 --> 01:06:49.566]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:49.626 --> 01:06:50.286]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:59.094 --> 01:07:00.235]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:00.275 --> 01:07:05.597]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:07:05.857 --> 01:07:10.479]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:07:10.879 --> 01:07:15.962]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:07:16.442 --> 01:07:21.164]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:07:21.684 --> 01:07:23.545]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:07:23.985 --> 01:07:28.586]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:07:28.786 --> 01:07:29.687]  And here's the best part.
[01:07:29.907 --> 01:07:32.667]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:07:32.967 --> 01:07:36.268]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:07:36.588 --> 01:07:39.429]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:07:39.769 --> 01:07:41.670]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.910]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:43.150]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:07:50.792 --> 01:07:55.318]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:07:55.639 --> 01:07:58.022]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:08:04.719 --> 01:08:05.360]  Big Brother.
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:07.081]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:07.781 --> 01:08:08.922]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:09.562 --> 01:08:10.383]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.163 --> 01:08:12.144]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.684 --> 01:08:16.307]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.887 --> 01:08:20.990]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.610 --> 01:08:29.135]  Geopolitical strategist, author, lecturer, essayist, a doctorate in history, and an economist.
[01:08:30.016 --> 01:08:32.598]  Webster Griffin Tarpley is our guest just for this segment.
[01:08:35.339 --> 01:08:39.281]  Then I'm going to get into foes of Tea Party movement to infiltrate rallies, pose as racist.
[01:08:39.722 --> 01:08:41.183]  Yeah, you heard that here weeks ago.
[01:08:41.703 --> 01:08:43.024]  But now it's in the AP.
[01:08:43.644 --> 01:08:44.965]  So this is a big victory.
[01:08:45.305 --> 01:08:47.927]  But I wanted to finish up with Webster, for those who just joined us.
[01:08:47.947 --> 01:08:52.930]  We're talking about the president of Poland, much of the military leadership going down in Russia.
[01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:54.951]  Four attempts to land.
[01:08:54.991 --> 01:08:56.732]  They told him, don't land here in heavy fog.
[01:08:57.853 --> 01:09:00.895]  And so, Webster, you're saying the jury is out.
[01:09:00.955 --> 01:09:01.975]  It's a bit suspicious.
[01:09:02.416 --> 01:09:04.297]  But it also looks like they were very stubborn.
[01:09:05.145 --> 01:09:05.685]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:09:05.805 --> 01:09:07.967]  Now, here's a comparison, okay?
[01:09:08.007 --> 01:09:27.097]  If you want to look at a case of somebody inside the European Union who was giving the European Union a hard time, you can look at this guy Haider, H-A-I-D-E-R, of Austria, who was a right-wing politician with the main thing being anti-foreigner stuff, and this was in southern Austria.
[01:09:28.101 --> 01:09:39.003]  He died in a very, very suspicious automobile crash in October of 2008 after winning an election at a time when he was going to be a kingmaker.
[01:09:39.223 --> 01:09:43.104]  Despite a giant demonization campaign in the media that he was a Nazi?
[01:09:43.124 --> 01:09:45.725]  Yeah, with all kinds of things going on against him.
[01:09:45.845 --> 01:09:50.646]  And it doesn't seem to me that the Nazi charge is really based on anything.
[01:09:50.666 --> 01:09:51.566]  It was simply that he was
[01:09:52.146 --> 01:09:58.888]  He was a Euro-skeptic, he was against the Lisbon Treaty, he was not happy with a lot of things going on in Brussels, but notice the difference.
[01:09:59.788 --> 01:10:08.530]  He was taken out of the picture right after winning a very important election when everybody knew that the next government of Austria would be profoundly influenced by him.
[01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:15.732]  There's a book by Gerhard Visnevsky about this, which is only in German so far as I know, but it's a very, very good investigation.
[01:10:16.512 --> 01:10:21.814]  In the case of Kaczynski now, Lech Kaczynski, he's basically on his way out.
[01:10:22.174 --> 01:10:25.475]  His brother had also been the prime minister of Poland, right?
[01:10:25.495 --> 01:10:29.957]  He had the Kaczynski twins, one president, one prime minister for a couple of years.
[01:10:30.657 --> 01:10:34.959]  The other brother had been kicked out as prime minister and replaced by this guy Tusk.
[01:10:35.459 --> 01:10:36.301]  We're good to go.
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:48.801]  Then there was the Cui Bono, right?
[01:10:48.841 --> 01:10:50.082]  Who benefits?
[01:10:50.182 --> 01:10:53.083]  This doesn't seem to me to be that obvious.
[01:10:53.163 --> 01:10:55.504]  Although, I guess you keep an open mind and see what happens.
[01:10:55.804 --> 01:11:06.950]  There will be continuing investigation, which apparently is being done jointly by the Russians and the Poles, so that the Poles can satisfy themselves that, well, as to what went on.
[01:11:07.605 --> 01:11:11.869]  All right, let's shift gears into the main subject, and I haven't asked your opinion on this.
[01:11:12.469 --> 01:11:18.854]  We will find out now if you concur, but we know Bush played the nuclear 9-11 card.
[01:11:19.735 --> 01:11:23.358]  We know that, well, I believe that they may do it.
[01:11:23.959 --> 01:11:28.662]  Now they've replaced the R with a Q in Iraq to Iran.
[01:11:29.683 --> 01:11:30.004]  I don't
[01:11:44.685 --> 01:11:45.485]  Nuclear exchanges.
[01:11:45.845 --> 01:11:51.748]  We're worried about Iran running Al-Qaeda and nuking America, which is asinine on so many fronts.
[01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:53.128]  Al-Qaeda is a CIA creation.
[01:11:53.188 --> 01:11:55.429]  Iran's anti-Al-Qaeda, Shiite.
[01:11:56.189 --> 01:11:59.070]  But it's a total replay of this in the lead-up.
[01:11:59.090 --> 01:12:03.092]  And then we have Medvedev coming out and saying, look, this could cause World War III.
[01:12:03.492 --> 01:12:05.333]  That's in Haaretz, the big paper out of Israel.
[01:12:05.633 --> 01:12:10.595]  Medvedev, Israel's strike on Iran could spark global catastrophe or Armageddon.
[01:12:11.335 --> 01:12:13.277]  And so, let's break this down.
[01:12:13.317 --> 01:12:28.312]  Do you concur that they could play a nuclear Armageddon card, or regardless, just by putting it out there, it's psychological terrorism invoking this fear at a time when the globalist agenda is stalling?
[01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:30.638]  I think that's quite accurate.
[01:12:30.999 --> 01:12:39.005]  The big thing that has changed, remember, is that there was an attempt to have a color revolution, CIA people power coup, inside Iran.
[01:12:39.025 --> 01:12:40.546]  In other words, to put a U.S.
[01:12:40.627 --> 01:12:46.611]  puppet regime into power in Tehran with this green revolution of Mousavi and Rafsanjani.
[01:12:46.631 --> 01:12:48.493]  And as far as I can see, this has failed.
[01:12:48.853 --> 01:12:49.894]  And therefore, the U.S.
[01:12:49.934 --> 01:12:54.538]  and the British are reversing their field and going back to the more Bush
[01:12:55.058 --> 01:12:55.538]  We're good to go.
[01:13:13.644 --> 01:13:14.525]  Very seriously.
[01:13:14.906 --> 01:13:29.420]  The goal of this conference that's going on in Washington right now is to fashion a cloak of credibility for a worldwide effort to gang up on Iran, and especially to create a kind of anti-Iranian front in the Middle East.
[01:13:29.981 --> 01:13:33.004]  And this is also the diplomacy vis-a-vis Netanyahu.
[01:13:33.544 --> 01:13:36.808]  It is that Obama wants to create, and his handlers above all,
[01:13:37.461 --> 01:13:46.389]  An alliance of countries that would be Arab and Sunni against the Iranians, who are of course Persians and Shiites.
[01:13:46.449 --> 01:13:57.458]  So the idea is to assemble Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states, the Gulf Cooperation Council, try to peel off Jordan, try to peel off Syria, try to get other countries.
[01:13:57.518 --> 01:14:00.841]  And I think that's essentially what's going on in Washington.
[01:14:01.261 --> 01:14:08.110]  What you have in Washington right now looks very much like the League of the Democracies that was talked about in the election campaign.
[01:14:08.751 --> 01:14:10.654]  Most notable is who is not here.
[01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:12.236]  Iran is not here.
[01:14:12.596 --> 01:14:13.858]  North Korea is not here.
[01:14:14.399 --> 01:14:15.360]  Syria not here.
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:16.682]  Venezuela not here.
[01:14:17.362 --> 01:14:18.202]  And you're in!
[01:14:36.647 --> 01:14:38.428]  In D.C., what's the overall mood?
[01:14:38.488 --> 01:14:40.969]  I mean, it seems they're now going into desperation.
[01:14:41.029 --> 01:14:48.531]  They forced through the health care, but now people are finding out it lowers standard of care and is a big payoff to the banks and insurance companies.
[01:14:49.612 --> 01:14:58.315]  Well, the thing with Obama is largely a, it's a photo opportunity, and you can say, well, you've got, a lot of people are here, right?
[01:14:58.335 --> 01:15:05.758]  The countries that are here, Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, those are countries that they'd like to lure into this anti-Iranian
[01:15:06.258 --> 01:15:14.603]  But how big of a defeat is it that Netanyahu wouldn't come because he knew that Egypt and Turkey were going to go, okay, we'll put sanctions on Iran.
[01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:16.964]  There's no evidence they have a weapons program.
[01:15:34.634 --> 01:15:36.437]  But we know you've got nukes.
[01:15:36.497 --> 01:15:37.459]  Let's talk about that.
[01:15:37.964 --> 01:15:42.866]  Well, of course, the Israelis have 400 or 500 or 600 nuclear weapons.
[01:15:42.906 --> 01:15:44.907]  They probably have thermonuclear weapons.
[01:15:44.987 --> 01:15:48.228]  They probably have hydrogen bombs.
[01:15:48.468 --> 01:15:49.889]  The Israelis, of course, are here.
[01:15:50.189 --> 01:15:51.730]  Just Netanyahu is not here.
[01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:56.312]  I think the guy is—Meridor is the Israeli delegate.
[01:15:57.352 --> 01:16:04.515]  Israel—in order to assemble this front of Arabs and Sunnis against the Iranian Shiites,
[01:16:05.176 --> 01:16:11.991]  Israel is expected to make concessions that will calm down the question with the Palestinians.
[01:16:12.051 --> 01:16:14.777]  In other words, Obama's line to Netanyahu is,
[01:16:15.521 --> 01:16:23.103]  You should basically patch things up with the Palestinians, and now let's go on then to deal with your real problem, which is Iran.
[01:16:23.123 --> 01:16:30.745]  In other words, your little problem is the Palestinians do something to... But Israel's saying they're going to continue the settlements.
[01:16:30.765 --> 01:16:33.926]  They're saying they're going to continue, but we only have a few minutes left here, Webster.
[01:16:33.946 --> 01:16:35.906]  Let's go back to the main issue at hand.
[01:16:36.286 --> 01:16:42.588]  Obama's main talking point and main statement at the center of this photo op is
[01:16:43.228 --> 01:16:48.234]  The number one threat is Al Qaeda, they work with Iran, and they're going to nuke us any minute.
[01:16:48.634 --> 01:16:51.638]  How would you see a false flag nuke deployed?
[01:16:52.599 --> 01:16:55.021]  Well, in any number of ways.
[01:16:55.262 --> 01:16:56.163]  Look at Biden.
[01:16:56.844 --> 01:17:04.032]  Biden has said in the past week that nuclear war is more likely now than ever before.
[01:17:04.844 --> 01:17:10.790]  In history, because of the probability of non-state actors getting nuclear devices.
[01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:17.477]  And Obama is talking, not just nuclear terrorism in general, but Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda.
[01:17:17.797 --> 01:17:20.520]  He's channeling Bush and Cheney once again.
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:24.044]  So, you know, let your imagination run wild.
[01:17:24.104 --> 01:17:24.985]  The main thing is,
[01:17:25.729 --> 01:17:35.827]  If any nuclear device goes off anywhere in the world, don't think Iran, think false flag done by the people who are going to benefit from this.
[01:17:37.005 --> 01:17:41.586]  Notice that the other thing that's going on is you've got the whole echelon crew, right?
[01:17:41.626 --> 01:17:46.387]  The British, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, they're all here.
[01:17:47.187 --> 01:17:48.927]  The main Europeans are here, right?
[01:17:48.987 --> 01:17:50.947]  France, Italy, Germany.
[01:17:50.967 --> 01:17:54.748]  So, again, it's the League of Democracies.
[01:17:54.848 --> 01:17:58.049]  It's the group of sort of pro-U.S.
[01:17:58.649 --> 01:18:01.549]  diehard, the people who are willing to talk at least.
[01:18:02.349 --> 01:18:05.930]  I would say it's the League of Democracies plus the five permanent members of the
[01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:12.117]  But I think the message is, the script Obama and the Anglo-Americans are putting out is, we're going to stage a false flag.
[01:18:12.137 --> 01:18:14.420]  I mean, all these politicians understand the real message.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.042]  We're going to stage a false flag.
[01:18:16.302 --> 01:18:20.047]  We're gearing up for Iraq too, but on a bigger scale with Iran.
[01:18:21.072 --> 01:18:25.575]  Yes, and that can probably be now a question of months.
[01:18:25.976 --> 01:18:31.980]  Obviously, the thing to do is take a look at the calendar, look at the time of the new moon, right?
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:43.349]  If wars are going to begin in the Middle East, you've got to find a time when there's no moon, because the stealth bombers and the cruise missiles are visible at night, so if there's a bright full moon, that's not going to be then.
[01:18:43.949 --> 01:18:51.993]  It's going to be sometime dark, and if it's going to be in the springtime, it's going to have to be according to that calendar.
[01:18:52.053 --> 01:18:55.935]  So work with that, and I would urge everybody to be on a special alert.
[01:18:55.975 --> 01:19:02.738]  There was, again, the whole period of 2008-2009, when this color revolution in Iran was being ginned up.
[01:19:03.978 --> 01:19:06.759]  The chances were low, but now the chances are high.
[01:19:07.279 --> 01:19:09.080]  And, of course, the Iranians know this.
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:12.261]  They're going to have their own counter-conference within a few days.
[01:19:12.621 --> 01:19:19.163]  They're going to have their own conference addressing some of these same issues, trying to put the onus on the U.S.
[01:19:19.223 --> 01:19:28.346]  And, indeed, Ahmadinejad has now turned to Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations and demanded, finally, the independent, impartial investigation of 9-11.
[01:19:29.666 --> 01:19:33.088]  Which is a very interesting initiative by Ahmadinejad.
[01:19:34.089 --> 01:19:36.490]  All right, very interesting times indeed.
[01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:38.571]  Webster has four books published.
[01:19:38.631 --> 01:19:42.973]  We sell them all on the economy, on the unauthorized biography of Obama.
[01:19:43.294 --> 01:19:49.957]  It's all available at Infowars.com and your purchase of this informative books and materials supports Webster and us.
[01:19:50.277 --> 01:19:51.618]  Webster, thanks for spending time with us.
[01:19:51.658 --> 01:19:51.978]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:19:52.038 --> 01:19:53.619]  All right, we'll be back.
[01:19:53.659 --> 01:19:58.542]  I'm going to get into a whole bunch of other important issues, other false flags where we've caught them.
[01:19:59.773 --> 01:20:09.515]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:20:09.795 --> 01:20:15.837]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:20:16.237 --> 01:20:25.079]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:20:25.459 --> 01:20:34.364]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:20:34.644 --> 01:20:39.227]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:20:39.247 --> 01:20:40.807]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:41.048 --> 01:20:43.549]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[01:21:11.814 --> 01:21:13.635]  forces, so we know it's tough.
[01:21:13.855 --> 01:21:14.636]  What kind of gear?
[01:21:14.876 --> 01:21:15.597]  Our own brands!
[01:21:15.837 --> 01:21:19.701]  Arctic Warrior, Homeland Defender, Sandbox Avenger, Urban Peacekeeper,

[01:22:01.753 --> 01:22:03.155]  You're subject to other police action.
[01:22:03.915 --> 01:22:04.876]  Tyranny is here.
[01:22:05.197 --> 01:22:08.760]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:22:09.121 --> 01:22:11.343]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:22:11.363 --> 01:22:16.788]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:23.435]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:22:23.875 --> 01:22:29.416]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:22:29.836 --> 01:22:33.537]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:22:34.037 --> 01:22:38.038]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:22:38.318 --> 01:22:43.839]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:22:44.259 --> 01:22:47.200]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:22:47.821 --> 01:22:49.224]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:22:49.785 --> 01:22:50.266]  It's here.

[01:22:59.207 --> 01:22:59.747]  You worry.

[01:23:02.148 --> 01:23:04.389]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.

[01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:11.591]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:23:11.991 --> 01:23:16.853]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:23:17.233 --> 01:23:20.534]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:23:21.034 --> 01:23:22.375]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:23:22.715 --> 01:23:25.317]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[01:23:25.577 --> 01:23:28.538]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:23:28.879 --> 01:23:37.043]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.

[01:24:42.119 --> 01:24:48.123]  Okay, so there's all these other false flag attacks going on, but the economic situation was a false flag attack.
[01:24:48.143 --> 01:24:55.247]  The big central banks, on record, engineered the financial implosion, bet against housing while telling people to invest.
[01:24:55.827 --> 01:25:00.190]  Then they threatened to destroy the economy in 2008 if we don't give them trillions of dollars.
[01:25:00.690 --> 01:25:04.132]  Now they're back, saying we've got to have carbon taxes, value-added taxes.
[01:25:04.513 --> 01:25:11.517]  They've got Republicans and Democrats pushing it, saying we've got to raise taxes, not just the new health care taxes or the increased income taxes.
[01:25:12.177 --> 01:25:23.983]  And as you know, Bloomberg and others have reported the federal regulators are now telling public and private pension funds, you will invest, I thought we were in a free country, in quote, failed banks to prop things up.
[01:25:25.163 --> 01:25:32.607]  Well, here is a key article out of the London Telegraph today by Ambrose Evans Pritchard.
[01:25:34.051 --> 01:25:36.833]  Argentina seizes pension funds to pay debts.
[01:25:37.193 --> 01:25:38.234]  Who's next?
[01:25:38.915 --> 01:25:40.356]  Here is a warning to us all.
[01:25:40.416 --> 01:25:46.260]  The Argentine state is taking control of the country's privately managed pension funds in a drastic move to raise cash.
[01:25:47.001 --> 01:25:50.544]  It is a foretaste of what may happen across the world as governments discover tax
[01:25:51.264 --> 01:25:56.188]  Revenue and discover that bond markets are unwilling to plug the gap.
[01:25:56.628 --> 01:26:01.612]  The G7 states are already acquiring an unhealthy taste for the arbitrary seizure of private property.
[01:26:02.112 --> 01:26:02.752]  I notice.
[01:26:03.293 --> 01:26:09.297]  And then he links to Spain, he links to Italy, he links to other countries that are already saying they're going to grab the pension funds.
[01:26:10.018 --> 01:26:11.038]  England's talking about it.
[01:26:11.739 --> 01:26:15.922]  Pakistan, Ukraine, Hungary, Switzerland, Britain, Australia.
[01:26:17.143 --> 01:26:19.625]  They're all talking about getting your pension funds.
[01:26:20.851 --> 01:26:22.692]  And a lot of private companies have already stolen them.
[01:26:22.992 --> 01:26:33.356]  You know, we've had callers call in, and I've seen the cases where General Electric, when a bunch of their employees are getting ready to retire, they will just sell it to their own subsidiary and just not pay you your pension.
[01:26:34.156 --> 01:26:37.597]  But, hey, land of the free, home of the brave, huh?
[01:26:37.617 --> 01:26:39.118]  You want the bankers running things, huh?
[01:26:40.218 --> 01:26:41.178]  Well, okay.
[01:26:41.559 --> 01:26:42.379]  Sky's the limit, then.
[01:26:44.266 --> 01:26:48.547]  And here is a LA Times article, healthcare overhaul won't stop premium increases.
[01:26:48.607 --> 01:26:50.388]  No, that's factored into it.
[01:26:50.528 --> 01:26:53.988]  A 39% increase for many, 30 on average.
[01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:58.710]  They get to cut your standard of care, make you buy insurance, and then raise the price.
[01:26:59.170 --> 01:27:01.871]  Now that they can make you buy it, hell, it might be a million dollars.
[01:27:02.351 --> 01:27:03.871]  They'll lock your butt up if you don't buy it.
[01:27:03.891 --> 01:27:04.851]  I mean, the sky's the limit.
[01:27:06.632 --> 01:27:09.673]  So there is that information, very, very important.
[01:27:12.970 --> 01:27:26.746]  On another extremely important note, we have Texas, we have Ohio, we have Michigan and many other states with county sheriffs and others saying
[01:27:28.717 --> 01:27:31.738]  We're laying off half or more of our police or sheriff's deputies.
[01:27:32.038 --> 01:27:32.998]  We can't protect you.
[01:27:33.018 --> 01:27:35.939]  The deputies we've got have been ordered to go out and raise revenue and write tickets.
[01:27:35.959 --> 01:27:36.739]  This is on the news.
[01:27:37.279 --> 01:27:38.419]  I've got three of the articles here.
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:41.240]  And so it's up to you to protect yourself.
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:49.922]  This is a monumental shift where they're admitting it's not their job and they can't protect you and they won't protect you and it's your job to be armed and defend yourself.
[01:27:51.002 --> 01:27:52.603]  That, of course, is an article
[01:27:54.452 --> 01:28:01.833]  It says Sheriff Arvin West, a county in Texas, tells citizens to arm themselves as he can no longer protect them from spillover border violence.
[01:28:02.314 --> 01:28:03.534]  Here's one from USA Today.
[01:28:03.614 --> 01:28:07.334]  Ohio official tells residents to arm themselves amid police cuts.
[01:28:08.155 --> 01:28:11.155]  They cut the deputies from 112 to 49 deputies.
[01:28:11.615 --> 01:28:20.317]  And there's so much bureaucracy, there's only one patrol car per shift for the entire county of hundreds and hundreds of square miles.
[01:28:22.096 --> 01:28:24.878]  Now, this is what Oklahoma is doing.
[01:28:24.898 --> 01:28:32.402]  They've always got good ideas there, except for not letting you have burglar bars on your house and wanting to have licenses to have a home garden because you might grow pot.
[01:28:32.702 --> 01:28:33.722]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[01:28:34.503 --> 01:28:36.544]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[01:28:36.664 --> 01:28:40.066]  Oklahoma Tea Parties and Lawmakers Envision Militia.
[01:28:41.749 --> 01:28:44.790]  Well, what do you think has always been the protection of the community?
[01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:50.611]  But they demonized citizens protecting themselves and moved to a professional government body doing it.
[01:28:50.831 --> 01:28:51.972]  And then it turned into a cesspit.
[01:28:52.812 --> 01:29:03.394]  Frustrated by recent political setbacks, Tea Party leaders and some conservative members of the Oklahoma legislature say they would like to create a new volunteer militia to help defend against what they believe are improper federal infringements on state sovereignty.
[01:29:03.754 --> 01:29:05.735]  This is the way to do the militia.
[01:29:06.923 --> 01:29:25.736]  The organized militia, state-level, county-by-county, under the sheriff, you elect a patriot sheriff, and then he picks good men and women of upstanding character who want to be volunteer, and you train with firearms, you learn the Constitution, and this is very, very exciting to see that happening.
[01:29:25.776 --> 01:29:30.319]  In fact, I want to get Charles Key and others on, get some state reps that are in this article on.
[01:29:31.755 --> 01:29:33.296]  With that subject.
[01:29:34.457 --> 01:29:48.229]  But when we come back with Paul Watson, we're going to get into this new government document from the White House that got leaked, that's confirmed to be authentic by AP and the London Guardian, where they say they're going to use fake environmentalism to set up a tyranny.
[01:29:49.991 --> 01:29:50.892]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.392 --> 01:29:52.994]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.914 --> 01:29:56.597]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.192 --> 01:30:04.813]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:05.153 --> 01:30:13.274]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:14.014 --> 01:30:18.055]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:18.635 --> 01:30:29.457]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:30.077 --> 01:30:39.100]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:44.642]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:30:45.022 --> 01:30:52.205]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:52.505 --> 01:30:55.266]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:30:59.970 --> 01:31:02.251]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:31:02.351 --> 01:31:04.552]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:31:04.672 --> 01:31:07.534]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:31:07.874 --> 01:31:12.636]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:31:12.976 --> 01:31:17.178]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:31:17.498 --> 01:31:19.821]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:22.364]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:31:22.724 --> 01:31:25.287]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:31:25.627 --> 01:31:33.236]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:31:33.576 --> 01:31:38.839]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:31:38.959 --> 01:31:41.241]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:31:41.281 --> 01:31:45.243]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:31:45.503 --> 01:31:46.404]  And I got news for you.
[01:31:46.584 --> 01:31:47.884]  You're everyone else.
[01:31:47.904 --> 01:31:48.985]  Invisible Empire.

[01:33:18.912 --> 01:33:20.734]  Well, here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:20.914 --> 01:33:24.599]  Invisible Empire, a new world order to find on DVD.
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:28.122]  This has got the expanded 30-plus minutes of extras.
[01:33:28.162 --> 01:33:30.803]  It's over a two-hour film, 18 months in the making.
[01:33:30.823 --> 01:33:39.869]  It exposes the shadow government, who the globalists are, their drug dealing, their white slavery dealing, how they use roundtable front groups to control society.
[01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:41.971]  It's got G. Edward Griffin.
[01:33:42.091 --> 01:33:43.312]  It's got Mark Dice.
[01:33:43.752 --> 01:33:44.973]  It's got Peter Del Scott.
[01:33:45.293 --> 01:33:46.654]  Jason Bermas is the director.
[01:33:46.794 --> 01:33:47.555]  I produced it.
[01:33:47.875 --> 01:33:49.256]  Our graphics guys worked on it.
[01:33:49.736 --> 01:33:54.579]  This film, you want to give somebody one film that really educates them with the latest info.
[01:33:54.799 --> 01:33:56.820]  Like, here's the New World Order, here's who your enemies are.
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:00.743]  You want to know what the New World Order is, and what it has in store, and how they're criminals, and how they run society?
[01:34:01.023 --> 01:34:01.403]  Here it is.
[01:34:01.443 --> 01:34:02.704]  You can order the DVD now.
[01:34:03.584 --> 01:34:07.527]  It officially comes out on the 15th, but we started shipping these today.
[01:34:07.807 --> 01:34:11.249]  So a lot of you will be getting them on or before the 15th, some a few days after.
[01:34:11.729 --> 01:34:13.830]  And your purchase also makes this radio show possible.
[01:34:14.271 --> 01:34:16.252]  Here it is, Invisible Empire New World Order Defined.
[01:34:16.872 --> 01:34:22.818]  Amazing new documentary film available at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139 or you can write to me P.O.
[01:34:22.878 --> 01:34:23.858]  Box 19549 Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:34:23.899 --> 01:34:24.199]  Again P.O.
[01:34:24.559 --> 01:34:25.240]  Box 19549 Austin, Texas 78760 or 888-253-3139.
[01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.270]  253-3139.
[01:34:37.290 --> 01:34:47.817]  And all of our other films have been huge successes because of you getting them, making copies, getting them out, having viewing parties, putting them on AXS TV, giving them to lawmakers.
[01:34:48.077 --> 01:34:49.578]  The people are ready to be awakened.
[01:34:49.678 --> 01:34:50.439]  Now is the time.
[01:34:50.939 --> 01:34:52.580]  It's going to premiere at 3 p.m.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:59.304]  Central after the show Thursday in four different high-quality formats and a DivX copy so you can burn it to disk.
[01:35:00.005 --> 01:35:03.287]  Regular disk that plays in CD and DVD players.
[01:35:03.307 --> 01:35:04.688]  We can use a CD so it's cheap.
[01:35:05.308 --> 01:35:06.268]  To give to people.
[01:35:07.089 --> 01:35:09.009]  And so I want to see this explode everywhere.
[01:35:09.029 --> 01:35:10.970]  I want to commend everybody that's done this in the past.
[01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:12.251]  I'm going to ask you to do it again now.
[01:35:13.751 --> 01:35:14.051]  Okay.
[01:35:16.752 --> 01:35:20.454]  Paul Joseph Watson, Kurt Nimmo, Steve Watson.
[01:35:22.045 --> 01:35:24.846]  Steve Watson and Paul Watson run PrisonPlanet.com for me.
[01:35:24.886 --> 01:35:27.106]  Kurt Nemo, Aaron Dykes run Infowars.com.
[01:35:27.566 --> 01:35:49.551]  But these three writers, in the last year, the last two months, the last 15 days or so, have written articles, Nemo wrote some like three weeks ago, identifying the anarchist as feds, showing all the mainstream news articles where they've been proven to be working for the feds or big foundations or the Democratic Party, but not just anarchists, other groups.
[01:35:50.979 --> 01:36:00.892]  As well, to go to tea parties, union thugs beating people up, that MSNBC says that the tea parties beat them up, even though there's video showing the opposite.
[01:36:04.071 --> 01:36:10.675]  Watson and Nemo in the last two weeks identified the anarchist major websites.
[01:36:10.716 --> 01:36:11.696]  These are non-anarchists, folks.
[01:36:11.716 --> 01:36:13.818]  You go to their events, they're wearing red stars.
[01:36:14.278 --> 01:36:15.579]  But it's all about deception with them.
[01:36:15.659 --> 01:36:16.639]  Oh, we're the anarchists!
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:22.503]  And you read, we're against these people that don't want big government and don't want welfare and don't want government health care.
[01:36:22.744 --> 01:36:24.585]  We're gonna get these racist fascists.
[01:36:24.665 --> 01:36:27.687]  Oh, they're real anarchists calling for a nanny state.
[01:36:27.987 --> 01:36:29.048]  No, they work for the bankers.
[01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:32.431]  Give me a document cam shot.
[01:36:32.471 --> 01:36:41.154]  I want to go over this with people who are watching on TV, not just radio, but I'm going to read the headlines for those who are listening who want to go and find these stories for themselves.
[01:36:41.994 --> 01:36:43.874]  And again, there's hundreds of these, but here are just a few.
[01:36:43.894 --> 01:36:52.796]  08 race worker held in damage to Colorado Democratic HQ, Denver Post, Democratic Party operatives arrested for attacking their own facility.
[01:36:53.377 --> 01:36:54.337]  And how many times has
[01:36:55.714 --> 01:36:59.355]  Different organizations painted swastikas on their own synagogue and been caught.
[01:36:59.736 --> 01:37:06.598]  How many times have black groups been caught defacing and burning crosses in front of their fraternity houses?
[01:37:07.039 --> 01:37:08.519]  This is a classic operation.
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:11.260]  Now, here's the issue.
[01:37:12.681 --> 01:37:14.742]  Here is an article written April 2nd.
[01:37:14.922 --> 01:37:17.703]  This is one written almost two weeks ago.
[01:37:19.110 --> 01:37:22.931]  Feds prepared to use anarchists to provoke Tea Party violence.
[01:37:23.551 --> 01:37:25.152]  And we had articles even weeks before this.
[01:37:25.172 --> 01:37:31.953]  And I'm not bragging, I'm saying this is showing the power of this radio show and listeners taking action and getting the word out.
[01:37:35.454 --> 01:37:36.235]  Here's another one.
[01:37:36.295 --> 01:37:39.496]  Provocateurs openly announced plans to stage Tea Party violence.
[01:37:40.336 --> 01:37:48.218]  He wrote another story two days ago with their memos saying we're going to pose as racist, we're going to pose and act like idiots, we're going to discredit them.
[01:37:50.478 --> 01:37:53.641]  Now, here is the Associated Press today.
[01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:58.725]  Foes of Tea Party movement to infiltrate rallies.
[01:37:59.546 --> 01:38:03.689]  And they list Jason Levin that we have specifically listed in the last week.
[01:38:05.210 --> 01:38:15.759]  Opponents of the fiscally conservative Tea Party movement say they plan to infiltrate and dismantle the political group by trying to make its members appear to be racist, homophobic or moronic.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:18.582]  You see folks, that is racketeering.
[01:38:19.670 --> 01:38:26.273]  To go after somebody's civil rights and their political right, to protest for a redress of grievance, to go false flag them.
[01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:27.473]  See, everything's false flag.
[01:38:28.093 --> 01:38:29.534]  I'm gonna get another false flag in a moment.
[01:38:30.254 --> 01:38:35.936]  To stage things, and it turned out the Black Caucus, from every video angle, went out and walked through the crowds.
[01:38:36.237 --> 01:38:39.158]  No one spit, no one yelled N-word, no one said we're gonna kill you.
[01:38:40.031 --> 01:38:41.172]  The media still says it happened.
[01:38:41.952 --> 01:38:43.813]  The Democratic Party, this is their policy.
[01:38:44.314 --> 01:38:45.575]  Obama's surrogates do this.
[01:38:45.595 --> 01:38:47.836]  Then he gets up and says, aw shucks, let's just get along.
[01:38:48.076 --> 01:38:49.437]  Then he demonizes talk radio.
[01:38:51.966 --> 01:38:52.487]  It continues.
[01:38:52.547 --> 01:39:07.800]  Jason Levin, creator of CrashTheTeaParty.org, said Monday the group has 65 leaders in major cities across the country who are trying to recruit members to infiltrate Tea Party events on April 15th, Tax Filing Day, when the Tea Party groups across the country are planning to gather and protest high taxes.
[01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:13.485]  It turns out he owns a computer company that does work for the city, so he gets city contracts.
[01:39:14.557 --> 01:39:22.264]  And it turns out he's tied into the coffee party set up by Obama a month ago to counter our announcement of the real coffee party to wake up the Tea Party.
[01:39:23.224 --> 01:39:27.148]  I want to go to Paul Joseph Watson now because this is very serious.
[01:39:27.808 --> 01:39:29.069]  They're not just going to stop there.
[01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:31.471]  They're going to demonize the Tea Party.
[01:39:31.792 --> 01:39:33.133]  They're going to set up militias.
[01:39:33.413 --> 01:39:37.516]  They're going to provocateur to demonize the idea of an armed citizenry to protect themselves.
[01:39:38.637 --> 01:39:41.059]  And this is all part of the false flag operation.
[01:39:41.079 --> 01:39:42.721]  But I wanted to get you on, Paul, to commend you.
[01:39:45.370 --> 01:39:45.890]  Thanks Alex.
[01:39:47.050 --> 01:40:00.474]  Yeah, well they've tried different tactics to hijack and infiltrate the Tea Party, which of course to a larger extent has been already infiltrated by Fox News neo-coms.
[01:40:00.534 --> 01:40:01.914]  That's right, the left-right team up.
[01:40:01.974 --> 01:40:11.217]  The right wing comes in, starts Tea Party Nation, takes it over, funds it, but then there's a rebellion against that, so they've got Democrats with the Coffee Party, and they've got the anarchists and others.
[01:40:11.257 --> 01:40:11.557]  Go ahead.
[01:40:12.611 --> 01:40:22.723]  Right, so, at first they tried with the Coffey Party, which completely failed because the organiser, Annabel Park, was exposed as an Obama operative.
[01:40:23.424 --> 01:40:28.951]  He had meetings in major cities at which three people showed up to these events in certain cities.
[01:40:29.451 --> 01:40:30.733]  It was a complete failure.
[01:40:31.351 --> 01:40:45.722]  So then they tried to stage these racist assaults, like you said, by having these congressmen and women walk straight through, completely outside of protocol, protest groups in the hope that it would provoke some kind of incident.
[01:40:45.742 --> 01:40:52.908]  It didn't, which is why they had to completely manufacture the Emanuel Cleaver spitting incident that never happened.
[01:40:53.488 --> 01:40:54.169]  That failed.
[01:40:54.912 --> 01:41:09.859]  So now it appears that they're trying to re-energize the Obama zombie youth, which is a dwindling minority, but energize them to carry out false flags through which the corporate media can then use to demonize the Tea Party.
[01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:17.123]  As you mentioned earlier, it began about two weeks ago with this anarchist website called InfoShop.
[01:41:17.859 --> 01:41:25.388]  Which called on its members to crash the tea parties, but not just to go up against the neocons, as you would think.
[01:41:25.829 --> 01:41:27.391]  They're mentioned directly by name.
[01:41:28.152 --> 01:41:32.878]  Alex Jones conspiracy types, Ron Paul supporters, libertarians, gun owners.
[01:41:33.358 --> 01:41:36.062]  So they're going after everybody, not just the neocons.
[01:41:36.658 --> 01:41:47.709]  Which mirrors the Southern Poverty Law Center, FBI battle plan where they keep demonizing yours truly because they know that we're truly creating a constitutional populist movement.
[01:41:47.749 --> 01:41:54.836]  And to digress for a moment, think of the true racism and the race baiting and the balkanization and the division
[01:41:55.396 --> 01:42:02.421]  That when we say we don't want government health care, we don't want new wars, racist, we don't like the banker bailout, racist.
[01:42:02.761 --> 01:42:06.584]  They are 24-7 invoking racial division.
[01:42:06.904 --> 01:42:09.886]  They are obviously a bunch of poverty pimps.
[01:42:09.926 --> 01:42:13.368]  This is how Chicago and New York control people in different racial groups.
[01:42:13.748 --> 01:42:18.111]  I mean, this is so criminal and so openly wicked.
[01:42:18.732 --> 01:42:23.115]  And because we're not racist, they've got to go in and now provocateur it.
[01:42:23.135 --> 01:42:25.276]  And this is a big blow to them that this is an AP.
[01:42:26.897 --> 01:42:45.805]  Well, the fact is, if, as they claim, and as Chris Matthews and Kirk Watson and all these other corporate stooges claim, that the Tea Party is full of, you know, quote, racist, homophobic morons, then why do they have to infiltrate it and carry out these false flags to
[01:42:46.698 --> 01:42:50.700]  ...characterise the Tea Party as being full of racists, homophobes and morons.
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:54.882]  If it already was, then they wouldn't need to do it in the first place, would they?
[01:42:55.542 --> 01:43:10.909]  But this is all designed to serve up exactly the kind of propaganda that the establishment media is begging for to fulfil its characterisation of anyone who expresses any kind of dissent against big government as a dangerous extremist.
[01:43:11.784 --> 01:43:18.609]  And what's ironic, as you mentioned earlier, what's rich is the fact that these so-called anarchists are nothing of the kind.
[01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:31.218]  They're calling for, you know, opposition to the Tea Party because they pose a threat to their government welfare when anarchism is supposed to be about limited or no government whatsoever.
[01:43:31.959 --> 01:43:36.002]  They talk about opposing gun owners.
[01:43:36.622 --> 01:43:39.664]  You know, they're supposed to oppose power and monopolies of the state.
[01:43:39.704 --> 01:43:40.685]  They're anarchists, right?
[01:43:41.252 --> 01:43:46.437]  And yet, they think that only agents of the state should have firearms and everybody else should be disarmed.
[01:43:46.957 --> 01:43:53.564]  So they're not anarchists, they're socialist punks at the best, and at the worst, they're statist thugs.
[01:43:54.184 --> 01:44:02.232]  And the establishment loves these kind of people because, as we've proven in the past, and as your police state movies, the early ones, proved,
[01:44:03.055 --> 01:44:14.722]  They've been infiltrated by provocateurs at nearly every major global summit to cause mayhem and violence, which is then exploited to demonize peaceful demonstrators.
[01:44:15.042 --> 01:44:17.804]  And that's exactly what they're planning again with these false flags.
[01:44:20.265 --> 01:44:25.168]  Well, you're right, Paul, but again, we've been proven right in spades once again that
[01:44:27.557 --> 01:44:30.658]  The Black Congressional Caucus, staged.
[01:44:32.158 --> 01:44:36.739]  The union thugs beating people up and then blaming it on patriots, staged.
[01:44:37.979 --> 01:44:40.419]  All of this is staged.
[01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:44.800]  And I have seen the anarchists come with the cops, leave with the cops.
[01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:51.041]  The anarchists have been caught all over the world, flown in by the governments, by the Ford Foundation.
[01:44:51.541 --> 01:44:54.782]  I've seen them handing out communist leaflets and then saying they're anarchists.
[01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:57.470]  This is such a sick joke.
[01:44:57.490 --> 01:45:12.714]  You got dirty, filthy, communist scum who all get government payments and socialist, collectivist trash running around saying that they're anarchists or libertarians.
[01:45:12.734 --> 01:45:18.596]  That's another form of false flag against real anarchists, blaming them for what this scum does.
[01:45:20.957 --> 01:45:23.978]  Yeah, the rhetoric they're spewing about Tea Parties.
[01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:25.331]  I don't think so.
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:40.281]  And that is that most Tea Parties are racist extremists.
[01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:41.741]  And let me expand on that.
[01:45:41.801 --> 01:45:50.484]  When the national poll last week that you covered said that 40% are independents or democrats in the Tea Party and that's what scares the system.
[01:45:50.664 --> 01:45:52.324]  That's why they sent Sarah Palin in.
[01:45:52.644 --> 01:46:00.966]  She said the Republican Party must take this over because they don't want a true anti-incumbency that will get people like Rand Paul in against neocon Republicans.
[01:46:01.006 --> 01:46:03.047]  Now, getting into another
[01:46:04.637 --> 01:46:12.199]  Well yeah, which is why people need to not be provoked by these individuals and just need to use video cameras as their weapon with which to expose their behavior.
[01:46:29.045 --> 01:46:35.712]  The real test of how it plays out will come down to if the mainstream media takes the bait.
[01:46:36.212 --> 01:46:49.546]  You know, if there's any kind of racist or violent incident at these tea parties on Thursday, then the headline in the corporate media is going to be something like, you know, N-word yelled at tea party rally.
[01:46:50.347 --> 01:46:52.029]  And only deep down within
[01:46:52.645 --> 01:46:59.297]  Those news reports and those articles, will they have something like, you know, Tea Party organisers claim the splurge was made by anarchists?
[01:47:00.034 --> 01:47:02.935]  Because they'll claim that they're being neutral about the whole issue.
[01:47:03.155 --> 01:47:03.655]  Exactly!
[01:47:03.675 --> 01:47:08.077]  You've got to be on site with the AP article for these ignorant reporters.
[01:47:08.137 --> 01:47:10.677]  Some of them will go over and you'll see them at stage.
[01:47:10.717 --> 01:47:14.279]  You'll see them set up in front and they'll bring the anarchists over.
[01:47:14.299 --> 01:47:16.799]  You'll see an Obama director, you know, local commie.
[01:47:17.039 --> 01:47:17.640]  Come on in.
[01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:18.520]  We're going to get their money.
[01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:19.540]  We're taking the country over.
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:20.240]  It's a revolution.
[01:47:20.641 --> 01:47:21.161]  Get right here.
[01:47:21.201 --> 01:47:25.702]  Now scream N-word and you can catch them right there.
[01:47:25.722 --> 01:47:27.703]  This could be a devastating blow against the scum.
[01:47:29.411 --> 01:47:34.694]  Yeah, and in the past, there's a famous, for example, CNN video of the CNN reporter.
[01:47:35.499 --> 01:47:45.565]  And, uh, the Tea Party activists filmed the whole scenario, and from the very beginning she's looking for people with signs that could be, um, characterized as extremists.
[01:47:45.585 --> 01:47:49.387]  She's looking for, you know, people who can't string two sentences together.
[01:47:49.767 --> 01:48:01.674]  So the corporate media are going to be out there in spades looking for these kind of people, and if they're on hand to provide these false flags, then you can bet that many areas of the corporate media are going to lap it up.
[01:48:02.114 --> 01:48:09.417]  But the fact that this has got out way ahead of time, and it's gone viral on the internet, that this is what they're planning, has kind of ruined it.
[01:48:09.957 --> 01:48:21.541]  Well Paul, don't you remember, there was another article I think Nemo wrote over a month ago, and I did an emergency alert on the radio, and I said get this out to all the tea parties, we've got to force this into mainstream media.
[01:48:21.801 --> 01:48:26.347]  I just want to point out again, the credit doesn't even go to InfoWars.com or PresentPlanet.com.
[01:48:26.708 --> 01:48:38.883]  It goes to our listeners who listened to what I said, got the article where you had all the proof and Nemo had all the proof, and they got these out to people, and now this is going to be another big blow against these provocateurs.
[01:48:38.943 --> 01:48:39.604]  Another issue!
[01:48:40.692 --> 01:48:41.793]  I support the militia.
[01:48:42.333 --> 01:48:43.434]  It is constitutional.
[01:48:43.914 --> 01:48:57.463]  I've warned militias that people try to infiltrate them and set them up and that fake militias have been created, and this has come out in the news over the last 20 years, 15, 16 years or so, to then demonize the idea of militia overall.
[01:48:57.824 --> 01:49:05.829]  Then I saw a few militias demonize me with a false flag, straw man, claiming that I was saying all militias were bad.
[01:49:06.109 --> 01:49:13.954]  When all I was saying is you're being infiltrated and provocateured just like the Tea Parties, that then identifies Feds as well.
[01:49:14.275 --> 01:49:17.257]  So again, we're learning how to identify the operatives here, Paul.
[01:49:18.596 --> 01:49:40.260]  Exactly, and one of the key red flags is the fact that they not only call for violence, but they directly threaten people by name, which is exactly what Hal Turner was doing when he was exposed as an FBI provocateur, paid by the federal government to make violent statements, which is exactly what they accuse us of doing when they're the main ones funding it and they're behind it.
[01:49:40.782 --> 01:49:51.467]  Paul, do you think they're getting ready to frame us with news articles every day, sometimes multiple times, saying we're calling for violence because we know that they're actually setting it up and they're angry at us?
[01:49:51.828 --> 01:49:53.568]  Or is it just a demonization tactic?
[01:49:55.249 --> 01:50:02.593]  I certainly think it was heading that way, especially with the numerous visits you got regarding comments on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:12.153]  Since we've gone to registration, it's more about quality than quantity, and they're not going to really find any, you know, violent threats on our website.
[01:50:12.313 --> 01:50:15.194]  Yeah, it's much more family-friendly, too.
[01:50:16.054 --> 01:50:17.095]  But they're not stopping.
[01:50:17.135 --> 01:50:20.736]  I mean, it's publications every day saying, I'm calling for killing police and government people.
[01:50:21.156 --> 01:50:29.038]  Not true, but again, they think the cops are just as dumb as the general public, and they think the cops are like, Dad Alex Jones says kill me!
[01:50:29.439 --> 01:50:30.179]  I'll kill him!
[01:50:31.516 --> 01:50:38.442]  Well, they're training the cops that people with bumper stickers saying live free or die on them at Infowars.com.
[01:50:38.762 --> 01:50:39.963]  A link to militias.
[01:50:40.003 --> 01:50:41.644]  We had a story about that yesterday.
[01:50:41.664 --> 01:50:47.509]  So they're going to try and look for nutcases like Richard Poplarski, who wasn't even influenced by us.
[01:50:47.549 --> 01:50:48.209]  He hated us.
[01:50:48.710 --> 01:50:51.492]  He had a domestic dispute with his mother about his dog.
[01:50:51.992 --> 01:50:55.255]  And they spin that out of all proportion to claim... Stay there, stay there.
[01:50:55.475 --> 01:50:56.316]  Exactly.
[01:50:56.716 --> 01:50:57.056]  Stay there.

[01:54:06.142 --> 01:54:16.425]  This can be as big as Climategate, proving the Democrats and big foundations are peddling racism and false flagging it and setting people up, and it's illegal.
[01:54:16.485 --> 01:54:17.485]  It's racketeering.
[01:54:17.985 --> 01:54:27.347]  It's corrupt organization, mafia tactics, and the police have been caught doing it to shut down peaceful protests, posing as anarchists, attacking their own officers over and over again.
[01:54:27.707 --> 01:54:29.828]  It's illegal, and we're calling you out.
[01:54:30.208 --> 01:54:31.368]  We're exposing you!
[01:54:31.449 --> 01:54:32.569]  You understand that?
[01:54:32.829 --> 01:54:34.410]  You're not going to destroy America.
[01:54:35.150 --> 01:54:36.831]  We're getting everybody wise to your tricks.
[01:54:36.871 --> 01:54:40.052]  Now another big article that I'm going to cover more tomorrow, but I'm ending with it.
[01:54:40.432 --> 01:54:41.613]  Leaked U.S.
[01:54:41.653 --> 01:54:44.294]  document calls for global regime to tackle climate change.
[01:54:45.114 --> 01:54:46.214]  And I've got the PDF.
[01:54:46.234 --> 01:54:47.195]  Will you guys bring it in to me?
[01:54:48.277 --> 01:54:51.898]  And it calls for a global government to enforce the edicts.
[01:54:51.918 --> 01:54:54.259]  They don't care if Copenhagen failed, they're going to do it.
[01:54:54.479 --> 01:54:56.119]  This is covered by the London Guardian.
[01:54:56.580 --> 01:55:06.103]  And we have Al Gore finally being tracked down by Fox News, running away from them and not answering the fact the glaciers are getting bigger, Mr. Gore, which they are.
[01:55:06.183 --> 01:55:10.344]  Record levels the last 30 years, Arctic and Antarctic, North and South Pole.
[01:55:11.124 --> 01:55:12.905]  Mr. Gore, what about Climategate?
[01:55:13.145 --> 01:55:14.585]  So finally this is coming out.
[01:55:14.605 --> 01:55:16.766]  Let's play that clip and get Paul Watson's take.
[01:55:18.001 --> 01:55:21.948]  Okay, we're going to go to Watson first and then do the clip of Al Gore.
[01:55:22.188 --> 01:55:30.423]  Watson, we've got so many UN, US, and globalist documents admitting world government through the environmental movement.
[01:55:30.443 --> 01:55:30.663]  Paul?
[01:55:31.832 --> 01:55:34.274]  Yeah, and this is official White House policy.
[01:55:34.954 --> 01:55:40.958]  It was leaked to The Guardian after it was discovered on a computer left in a European hotel room.
[01:55:41.418 --> 01:55:48.382]  And it's basically a White House directive that says that their number one goal is to quote, reinforce the perception that the U.S.
[01:55:48.462 --> 01:55:50.463]  is constructively engaged in U.N.
[01:55:50.503 --> 01:55:56.307]  negotiations in an effort to produce a global regime to combat climate change.
[01:55:56.900 --> 01:56:04.686]  So anyone who thought there was a fissure between the US government and the United Nations, that's being completely proven redundant.
[01:56:04.726 --> 01:56:11.111]  Now Obama administration is fully behind the push for a global government in the name of saving the Earth.
[01:56:11.752 --> 01:56:13.253]  And of course it's now come out that
[01:56:13.832 --> 01:56:33.361]  The British lawyer who called for eco-side laws to be introduced, whereby if you express scepticism towards man-made climate change, then you're committing a crime against humanity and you're liable to be tried in the International Criminal Court.
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:52.118]  It's turned out that basically she's on the board of an organization that was created directly and is funded by the Club of Rome, which of course is the organization founded by David Rockefeller in 1968, which tasked itself with manufacturing
[01:56:52.808 --> 01:57:00.697]  A scare surrounding the environment and global warming in an effort to manipulate the public into supporting global government.
[01:57:00.717 --> 01:57:04.382]  Alright, we're almost out of time, but we have their own documents in trouble again.
[01:57:04.422 --> 01:57:05.523]  There's no longer any denial.
[01:57:05.883 --> 01:57:07.105]  Here is Al Gore.
[01:57:07.205 --> 01:57:11.830]  Everywhere he goes, he's hounded, he's a fraud, he's a criminal piece of trash.
[01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:12.271]  Here he is.
[01:57:13.390 --> 01:57:15.692]  Mr. Vice President, Jesse Waters, Fox News.
[01:57:15.732 --> 01:57:16.132]  How are you?
[01:57:16.152 --> 01:57:16.512]  How are you?
[01:57:16.552 --> 01:57:16.832]  Fine.
[01:57:16.952 --> 01:57:19.974]  Hey, why won't you come on the O'Reilly Factor, Mr. Vice President?
[01:57:20.475 --> 01:57:20.955]  I don't like that.
[01:57:20.975 --> 01:57:23.717]  You know Bill's not a big anti-global warming guy.
[01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:30.221]  Mr. Vice President.
[01:57:30.241 --> 01:57:32.462]  I don't like ambush journalism.
[01:57:32.482 --> 01:57:35.044]  No, but why won't you come on the show?
[01:57:35.084 --> 01:57:36.085]  Come on, it'll be fun.
[01:57:36.505 --> 01:57:37.726]  There's two sides to this story.
[01:57:38.953 --> 01:57:39.553]  Well, I'll consider it.
[01:57:40.034 --> 01:57:40.674]  You will consider it?
[01:57:40.734 --> 01:57:40.894]  Sure.
[01:57:41.415 --> 01:57:41.915]  Alright, great.
[01:57:42.336 --> 01:57:49.921]  So, you know, while we have you here, what's your reaction to the fact that the Arctic ice is actually increasing?
[01:57:50.222 --> 01:57:51.543]  I'm not doing an interview right now.
[01:57:52.003 --> 01:57:55.245]  One last question for you.
[01:57:55.466 --> 01:57:59.369]  Are you embarrassed at all by ClimateGate, sir?
[01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:03.592]  I'm not doing an interview right now.
[01:58:03.652 --> 01:58:04.272]  I'm having lunch.
[01:58:05.493 --> 01:58:07.555]  Do you stand to make any money from cap-and-trade?
[01:58:09.642 --> 01:58:10.482]  All right, there you go.
[01:58:10.603 --> 01:58:12.904]  I mean, Watson, everywhere he's getting hounded.
[01:58:12.944 --> 01:58:17.666]  This guy is a shameless eugenicist who wants to take over our society.
[01:58:18.066 --> 01:58:21.028]  He's got like 10 houses, one of them 24,000 square feet.
[01:58:21.068 --> 01:58:21.608]  Paul Watson.
[01:58:22.469 --> 01:58:26.611]  Yeah, and he's intimately involved in the Chicago Climate Exchange with Maurice Strong.
[01:58:27.231 --> 01:58:33.794]  And the reality is that we've had the coldest winter in decades in plenty of areas of the globe.
[01:58:33.874 --> 01:58:36.176]  And reality is not living up to their alarmism.
[01:58:36.276 --> 01:58:36.836]  Exactly!
[01:58:36.896 --> 01:58:37.556]  Great job!
[01:58:37.576 --> 01:58:38.557]  See you back live tomorrow.
