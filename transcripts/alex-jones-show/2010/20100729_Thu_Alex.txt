[00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:08.839]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:10.320]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:12.061]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:16.304]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.825 --> 00:00:20.888]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.618 --> 00:00:30.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.282]  It is Thursday, the 29th day of July, 2010.
[00:00:33.403 --> 00:00:39.128]  We have a power-packed transmission lined up for you today.
[00:00:39.148 --> 00:00:43.172]  A member of the Icelandic Parliament, Birgitta Jones-Dottir.
[00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:43.792]  Yes.
[00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:05.924]  High-level CIA analyst to Reagan and Bush Sr.
[00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:09.428]  talking about the green lighting of an attack on Iran.
[00:01:09.508 --> 00:01:10.509]  Is it a full green light?
[00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:11.890]  Are they preparing to green light it?
[00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.512]  We'll get his intel from D.C.
[00:01:15.053 --> 00:01:16.294]  coming up.
[00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:26.603]  Then, after that, the last 30 minutes of the third hour, we're going to have Phil Berg, the lawyer, the father of the birther movement,
[00:01:27.644 --> 00:01:32.246]  Will be joining us as well to give us updates on those issues.
[00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:49.153]  But in the first hour and 20 minutes of the broadcast today, for this hour and 20 minutes into the next before Birgitta joins us, it is just a total information overload of key information on so many fronts and I will cover all of these stacks I have.
[00:01:49.673 --> 00:01:54.215]  But first off, I was browsing InfoWars.com further down the page
[00:01:55.075 --> 00:02:11.866]  And reading articles that we had linked to in the last three or four days that I hadn't had time to look at and I saw one about raids on health food stores in Southern California and I watched the surveillance camera footage of a health food store selling
[00:02:13.117 --> 00:02:24.742]  Goat milk that you can buy right here in Austin and they raided them with guns and were screaming at them and pointing guns at people at a health food store at hippies that wouldn't hurt a fly.
[00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:30.215]  And it just illustrates how out of control the federal and state governments are.
[00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:34.337]  This was a federal slash state slash local police raid.
[00:02:34.677 --> 00:02:36.278]  And it just got me so hot.
[00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.040]  So that is going to be coming up later in this hour.
[00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:43.623]  There's no audio on the video, but it's linked up on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:43.923 --> 00:02:47.765]  For PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, we'll be playing the surveillance camera footage.
[00:02:47.805 --> 00:02:50.006]  And for radio listeners, I'll be describing it.
[00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:53.629]  You can go to InfoWars.com and go to the story.
[00:02:54.862 --> 00:03:02.147]  From the Los Angeles Times, headline, Raw Food Raid Highlights a Hunger.
[00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.053]  And I'm seeing reports like this around the country every week or two.
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.443]  Where you'll have a family of farmers selling eggs and watermelons out on the side of the road.
[00:03:18.184 --> 00:03:24.627]  And they send an undercover officer to buy eggs and watermelons and they arrest them for not supposedly paying sales tax.
[00:03:26.768 --> 00:03:29.610]  Or they arrest them for selling eggs or milk or cheese.
[00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.311]  Or they raid their homes.
[00:03:31.771 --> 00:03:33.772]  And they're harassing the Amish now.
[00:03:34.493 --> 00:03:41.537]  And it just illustrates the fact that Prudential and other insurance companies are in a detailed Bloomberg report.
[00:03:42.708 --> 00:03:47.669]  Gotta say, I don't like Mayor Bloomberg, but I really like Bloomberg, his company.
[00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.031]  I mean, the news, the investigative reports they put out dwarf anything I'm seeing in the world.
[00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:59.052]  And time and time again they report things we already know, but they're the only mainstream outlet to detail it.
[00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:04.274]  And it's how Prudential and others are swindling, and it's admittedly illegal,
[00:04:05.474 --> 00:04:17.744]  Uh, they take out insurance policies on troops, and then when the troops get killed, they don't even pay any of the insurance to the families, and they send them a letter to basically steal the money from them to manipulate them.
[00:04:19.706 --> 00:04:24.930]  And then now that they might pay a fine that's a tiny fraction, it's not just Prudential, it's others, according to Bloomberg.
[00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:31.303]  It's just these banks and insurance companies are criminals, and they run the government.
[00:04:31.823 --> 00:04:36.165]  They're the ones setting up this whole New World Order, so that's coming up.
[00:04:36.725 --> 00:04:45.408]  I also have talked a lot in the last decade about Google being an NSA front, and actually being a crystal ball to tell the future.
[00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.472]  That's not my words.
[00:04:47.512 --> 00:04:49.556]  I've read that in declassified Pentagon documents.
[00:04:50.118 --> 00:04:52.182]  But here it is in Wired Magazine today.
[00:04:52.703 --> 00:04:54.968]  Google openly announces they can tell the future.
[00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.890]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:56.371]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.642 --> 00:05:03.584]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:05:03.824 --> 00:05:09.848]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:05:10.228 --> 00:05:17.332]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:05:17.612 --> 00:05:22.195]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:05:22.495 --> 00:05:24.636]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:27.438 --> 00:05:30.961]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:33.443]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:05:33.483 --> 00:05:33.804]  Call us.
[00:05:46.935 --> 00:05:53.384]  At 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:05:53.484 --> 00:05:53.945]  Thank you!
[00:06:01.206 --> 00:06:04.827]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:05.167 --> 00:06:13.289]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.051]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:29.474]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:06:30.094 --> 00:06:39.123]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:39.623 --> 00:06:44.688]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:06:45.048 --> 00:06:52.235]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:52.555 --> 00:06:55.298]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:06:59.124 --> 00:07:03.347]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:04.268]  Number 1.
[00:07:04.588 --> 00:07:07.730]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:08.571]  Number 2.
[00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:13.415]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:13.755 --> 00:07:14.195]  It's true.
[00:07:14.495 --> 00:07:19.059]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:19.919]  Number 3.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.482]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:23.782 --> 00:07:27.485]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:27.685 --> 00:07:28.226]  Number 4.
[00:07:28.486 --> 00:07:30.849]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:34.633]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:34.933 --> 00:07:35.133]  Number 5.
[00:07:35.714 --> 00:07:39.638]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:39.859 --> 00:07:44.624]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:44.904 --> 00:07:48.927]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.067 --> 00:07:50.628]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:50.868 --> 00:07:52.950]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.371]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:58.474]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:12.028 --> 00:08:13.170]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.452]  We are live.
[00:08:14.472 --> 00:08:16.275]  It is Thursday, the 29th day of July, 2010.
[00:08:20.387 --> 00:08:24.610]  We again have a jam-packed radio transmission for you today.
[00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.794]  Member of the Icelandic Parliament to talk about Wikileaks and a lot more because she's worked with them.
[00:08:30.094 --> 00:08:33.576]  Birgitta Jones-Dottir pops in in the second half of the next hour.
[00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.337]  Then Ray McGovern and Phil Berg.
[00:08:35.978 --> 00:08:37.999]  Extremely informative information.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.442]  Of course, Phil Berg, attorney, the founder of the birther movement.
[00:08:42.122 --> 00:08:46.405]  Which is continuing to pick up steam despite media disinformation and demonization.
[00:08:46.565 --> 00:08:55.951]  And Ray McGovern, high-level CIA analyst to Ronald Reagan and George Bush Senior, will get his inside scoop on the green lighting of the attack on Iran.
[00:08:56.391 --> 00:09:01.594]  But the next hour and 20 minutes or so, before the guests start joining us today,
[00:09:02.555 --> 00:09:05.658]  We've got a lot of news to cover and a short time to get there.
[00:09:06.219 --> 00:09:07.000]  So let me just do this.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.765]  Let me just read the headlines, just the headlines, and then I'm going to go back through it in more detail.
[00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:13.767]  But just to give you an idea what we're dealing with.
[00:09:14.928 --> 00:09:19.433]  White House proposal would ease FBI access to records of internet activity.
[00:09:21.107 --> 00:09:25.208]  ISPs, your personal computers, everything, no Fourth Amendment.
[00:09:25.708 --> 00:09:33.070]  And it says right here in the first paragraph, without warrants, just the complete end of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:37.632]  And I was driving into work this morning, in fact I'm tempted to call KLBJ 590.
[00:09:39.272 --> 00:09:40.333]  Because I'm friends with him.
[00:09:40.353 --> 00:09:41.094]  They carry the show.
[00:09:42.115 --> 00:09:45.698]  And get him to get me that call that came in at about 1025.
[00:09:46.098 --> 00:09:49.181]  In fact, will you guys call Thomas McDonald?
[00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:50.281]  His number is in my phone.
[00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:51.362]  He actually called me yesterday.
[00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:54.265]  And call him and ask if he can MP3 us.
[00:09:54.705 --> 00:09:57.808]  That lady saying, I want to give up my liberty for freedom.
[00:09:58.408 --> 00:10:01.311]  I want the FBI to search all our computers.
[00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:02.872]  This Constitution is bad.
[00:10:03.432 --> 00:10:10.258]  It's going to allow the terrorists to attack us and we've got to let the government do whatever it wants.
[00:10:10.678 --> 00:10:12.320]  And I just wanted to scream at her.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:18.224]  In fact, I was actually yelling at the radio and telling her, lady, governments are always what is most dangerous.
[00:10:19.195 --> 00:10:26.137]  This government is so corrupt, has been caught lying so many times, is run by such corrupt corporations that have hijacked it.
[00:10:26.457 --> 00:10:27.618]  What are you talking about?
[00:10:27.858 --> 00:10:34.800]  The entire Homeland Security apparatus was built and designed and is pointed at the American people.
[00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:36.301]  That's on record!
[00:10:37.605 --> 00:10:39.566]  But she is just the perfect example.
[00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:41.087]  I've got to get that call.
[00:10:41.587 --> 00:10:54.313]  I've got to get that call and play it here on air because she was just as stupid and mindless as the woman who I interviewed in London at a vegetable and fruit stand right outside one of the places that got bombed.
[00:10:54.893 --> 00:11:02.917]  And I walk up to her and I talk about how the police had killed an innocent man just a few days after the attack, execution style.
[00:11:02.957 --> 00:11:06.039]  And she said, well, I think we should give up our liberty for freedom.
[00:11:06.843 --> 00:11:08.064]  What an oxymoron!
[00:11:08.504 --> 00:11:14.546]  This woman I heard today was even stupider than that, and she illustrates everything we're fighting.
[00:11:14.846 --> 00:11:16.727]  How these sheeple just love to be slaves.
[00:11:16.747 --> 00:11:18.728]  But I'm sorry, I should not read the headlines.
[00:11:18.808 --> 00:11:22.329]  I'm already digressing here.
[00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:30.392]  White House proposal would ease FBI access to records of Internet activity.
[00:11:32.213 --> 00:11:36.355]  And then you read the article, it says, no longer have any warrants.
[00:11:38.387 --> 00:11:43.091]  Look at this incredible Google story out of Wired Magazine.
[00:11:43.151 --> 00:11:50.436]  Headline, exclusive, Google CIA invest in future of web monitoring in live time.
[00:11:50.536 --> 00:11:53.539]  CIA tracking everything you do, live time.
[00:11:54.159 --> 00:11:55.200]  No warrants, no nothing.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.962]  Now listen to this first line.
[00:11:57.688 --> 00:12:00.311]  I'm going to get back into this later, but how many times have you heard me talk about this?
[00:12:00.691 --> 00:12:01.412]  Word for word.
[00:12:02.072 --> 00:12:05.756]  And I've gotten a lot of people making jokes about it on the web and saying I'm crazy.
[00:12:05.796 --> 00:12:07.077]  They won't go research my facts.
[00:12:07.377 --> 00:12:08.298]  They just say I'm lying.
[00:12:08.939 --> 00:12:20.410]  The investment arm of the CIA, In-Q-Tel, and Google are both backing a company that monitors the web in real time and says it uses the information to predict the future.
[00:12:21.391 --> 00:12:23.012]  That's what all of this is about.
[00:12:23.312 --> 00:12:27.114]  RFID, face scanning cameras, they're already doing it.
[00:12:27.494 --> 00:12:33.277]  They are already predicting mass movements to upwards of 99% and individual movements up to 93%.
[00:12:34.578 --> 00:12:35.779]  And that's what they admit.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.161]  They know what you're going to do before you do it.
[00:12:40.461 --> 00:12:41.942]  That's what this is really all about.
[00:12:41.962 --> 00:12:43.263]  And Google is the NSA.
[00:12:46.428 --> 00:12:47.569]  Here's another key article.
[00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.633]  Seven people have been entrusted with the keys to the entire internet.
[00:12:52.013 --> 00:13:01.202]  Seven people can bring down the entire domain system and shut the web off in a matter of seconds.
[00:13:01.222 --> 00:13:02.263]  We're going to be covering that.
[00:13:02.923 --> 00:13:04.705]  Also out of NBC.
[00:13:05.586 --> 00:13:09.609]  Details of 100 million Facebook users published online.
[00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:13.860]  Facebook had told them they would never share it if you wanted to be a private profile.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.681]  Not anymore.
[00:13:16.101 --> 00:13:18.562]  Because he thinks you're a bunch of dumb effers.
[00:13:18.602 --> 00:13:19.223]  Remember that quote?
[00:13:19.543 --> 00:13:21.424]  These dumb effers think they can trust me.
[00:13:21.704 --> 00:13:22.805]  They are such schmucks.
[00:13:23.165 --> 00:13:24.446]  Ha ha ha.
[00:13:25.366 --> 00:13:26.867]  Ha ha ha.
[00:13:26.887 --> 00:13:29.688]  And of course, Facebook is admittedly CIA.
[00:13:30.329 --> 00:13:35.752]  Twitter is admittedly run by the State Department, which is the international conglomerate arm of the CIA.
[00:13:36.092 --> 00:13:39.754]  And it's just all about flaunting it in your face and trying to break your will.
[00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:43.330]  Here's another important report out of Alternet.
[00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:49.314]  Has the most common marijuana test resulted in tens of thousands of wrongful convictions?
[00:13:49.714 --> 00:13:51.135]  The answer is yes.
[00:13:51.636 --> 00:14:00.102]  It's all quackery, just like what we see going on with the old lie detector test.
[00:14:00.162 --> 00:14:06.067]  And so they're now replacing those with brain scanners and predictive pre-crime systems.
[00:14:07.082 --> 00:14:22.137]  So we'll be discussing all of that and Curt Nemo has got an excellent article that's up on InfoWars.com right now that details this pre-crime so-called prediction system
[00:14:24.417 --> 00:14:32.222]  The problem is they can put any false data they want into this and falsely claim that the system predicted that you were going to commit a crime.
[00:14:32.242 --> 00:14:37.866]  And that's the issue with this panoptagon, is that we know governments will abuse it.
[00:14:38.186 --> 00:14:40.728]  We know the founding fathers warned us about this type of thing.
[00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:45.410]  And we know that they've been caught putting out this info as well.
[00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:57.253]  But Google and CIA fund political pre-crime technology is the Kurt Nemo story that just went up on InfoWars.com in the last 30 minutes.
[00:14:57.593 --> 00:15:00.573]  And we're going to be going over that as well today.
[00:15:01.454 --> 00:15:03.614]  In some of the other news, document leak.
[00:15:03.994 --> 00:15:04.714]  Part of U.S.
[00:15:04.794 --> 00:15:10.936]  plot says Pakistani ex-general with ties to the Taliban, the former head of Pakistani intelligence,
[00:15:11.735 --> 00:15:26.004]  Hamid Gul, who again, a year and a half ago, came out and said that the West had staged the attacks in Mumbai.
[00:15:26.044 --> 00:15:31.628]  The head of Indian intelligence had said the same thing, and lo and behold, a year later it came out in mainstream U.S.
[00:15:31.668 --> 00:15:39.633]  news that indeed the commander of the people that attacked the shopping mall in Mumbai, India, were
[00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:43.314]  Government agents from the United States.
[00:15:44.696 --> 00:15:50.182]  But again, when that finally came out in the mainstream news, it was just a mere blurb.
[00:15:50.202 --> 00:15:52.545]  It should have been the top story.
[00:15:54.099 --> 00:16:04.966]  Instead we know that Google and others that are NSA fronts pump the web with basically fake top search terms like Mel Gibson, Lindsay Lohan, LeBron James.
[00:16:05.366 --> 00:16:11.310]  They basically set the agenda for petty mindless issues as one of their other
[00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:41.670]  Control systems, I'm gonna cover this more coming up later in the hour, but for prison planet TV viewers Let's just start playing some of that video for folks to be able to see it This is again linked up on info wars.com raw food raids Highlights a hunger some people balk at restrictions on selling unprocessed milk and other foods how can we not have the freedom to choose what we eat one says regulators say rules exist for safety and fairness
[00:16:42.631 --> 00:16:57.648]  And they come in to the health food store, in the back door in their warehouse, with their guns drawn, and when they see the hippies in there at the health food store, the officers point their guns at them and tell them, get on the floor.
[00:16:58.649 --> 00:17:01.492]  So, they're going to expand the drug war.
[00:17:02.466 --> 00:17:05.268]  into your farms and ranches.
[00:17:05.388 --> 00:17:17.576]  Big Agra is writing rules that will shut down all the small farms and ranches and just they've rated farms that grow things like aloe vera saying it can supposedly get you high.
[00:17:18.056 --> 00:17:25.661]  They want to make you have to get a prescription for vitamin C. It's all part of Codex Alimentarius so that is coming up as well.
[00:17:27.982 --> 00:17:28.702]  Here's another one.
[00:17:28.743 --> 00:17:35.305]  White House backs bill to collect employee pay information from all businesses, the total tracking grid.
[00:17:35.966 --> 00:17:38.507]  Axe falls on National Health Services.
[00:17:38.947 --> 00:17:45.530]  They're massively slashing all different types of surgeries, basic health care, eye surgeries.
[00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.071]  They're saying get a cane!
[00:17:47.731 --> 00:17:48.511]  Just like in Cuba.
[00:17:48.551 --> 00:17:49.432]  You don't get eye surgery.
[00:17:49.472 --> 00:17:50.612]  They say, use a cane.
[00:17:51.032 --> 00:17:51.192]  You're 65.
[00:17:51.472 --> 00:17:53.733]  You're supposed to start losing your eyesight.
[00:17:54.093 --> 00:17:55.213]  Get a cane, old lady.
[00:17:55.513 --> 00:17:56.574]  Get a cane, old man.
[00:17:57.354 --> 00:18:04.416]  NHS bosses have drawn up secret plans for sweeping cuts to services with restrictions on the most basic treatments for the sick and injured.
[00:18:05.456 --> 00:18:07.617]  Hope you enjoy the eugenics healthcare.
[00:18:07.937 --> 00:18:13.679]  Hope you enjoy the Malthusian healthcare, because it is here, and it's here big time.
[00:18:15.279 --> 00:18:17.160]  And I mentioned this at the very start of the show.
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.321]  We're going to get some guests on about this in the next week, because I'm really hot about this.
[00:18:22.261 --> 00:18:34.686]  And I'd read about this here and there, but this detailed 15-page report from Bloomberg is nothing less than stunning.
[00:18:35.266 --> 00:18:40.367]  Fallen soldiers' families denied cash as insurers profit.
[00:18:40.868 --> 00:18:41.828]  And then you read the article,
[00:18:44.983 --> 00:19:11.992]  And it talks about how these insurance companies take out insurance on troops and then because they name the families as beneficiaries but write it up where they send them a blank checkbook saying here's your money it's in this account but then it's a fake checkbook when you go to cash them the money's not good and then they keep the money and they're saying well since we're not FDIC we're allowed to keep your money.
[00:19:13.212 --> 00:19:14.294]  And Walmart does this.
[00:19:14.334 --> 00:19:16.016]  They take insurance out on those greeters.
[00:19:16.376 --> 00:19:17.377]  And they have actuaries.
[00:19:17.417 --> 00:19:20.721]  They know, statistically, how many are going to die per year.
[00:19:21.362 --> 00:19:27.930]  People are like, oh sweet, they're giving that 79-year-old lady who's had two heart attacks and cancer a job greeting people.
[00:19:28.611 --> 00:19:32.315]  No, they've got a million dollars or more of insurance on her and her family isn't getting it.
[00:19:35.267 --> 00:19:36.828]  I mean, this is the pure evil.
[00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:40.792]  And these are the banks and insurance companies that run this nation.
[00:19:41.352 --> 00:19:45.876]  So we're going to be covering that more coming up later in the broadcast.
[00:19:45.896 --> 00:19:47.758]  And we also got three guests coming up.
[00:19:47.798 --> 00:19:49.960]  Birgitta Jones-Daugherty here, a member of the Icelandic Parliament.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.183]  Ray McGovern on the Iran attack, former CIA.
[00:19:53.543 --> 00:19:58.127]  And then, of course, attorney at law, the Counselor Phil Berg, father of the Birthers.
[00:19:58.447 --> 00:19:59.088]  It's all coming up.
[00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:01.511]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:01.551 --> 00:20:06.893]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:20:07.133 --> 00:20:11.775]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:20:12.155 --> 00:20:12.555]  It's true.
[00:20:12.635 --> 00:20:15.216]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:20:15.456 --> 00:20:17.197]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:20:17.737 --> 00:20:22.440]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:20:22.961 --> 00:20:24.882]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:20:25.262 --> 00:20:29.885]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:20:30.065 --> 00:20:30.966]  And here's the best part.
[00:20:31.186 --> 00:20:33.948]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:20:33.968 --> 00:20:37.570]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:40.732]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.974]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:20:43.294 --> 00:20:44.215]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:20:47.857 --> 00:20:49.619]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:20:52.082 --> 00:20:56.607]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:20:56.927 --> 00:20:59.310]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:21:00.137 --> 00:21:05.000]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:05.881]  What have we got?
[00:21:06.101 --> 00:21:08.222]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:21:08.542 --> 00:21:09.283]  A republic.
[00:21:09.543 --> 00:21:12.124]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:21:12.205 --> 00:21:14.106]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:21:14.466 --> 00:21:16.367]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:21:16.487 --> 00:21:17.768]  So they think they own our land?
[00:21:18.168 --> 00:21:19.289]  They think they own our water?
[00:21:19.489 --> 00:21:19.889]  Children?
[00:21:20.089 --> 00:21:20.870]  Our education?
[00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:21.850]  Our money?
[00:21:22.051 --> 00:21:25.693]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:21:26.053 --> 00:21:29.717]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:21:29.757 --> 00:21:30.719]  You'll be warned!
[00:21:31.019 --> 00:21:31.860]  We have the facts.
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.181]  We have the Constitution.
[00:21:33.221 --> 00:21:34.103]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:21:34.123 --> 00:21:34.964]  We have common law.
[00:21:35.004 --> 00:21:37.266]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:41.311]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:21:41.411 --> 00:21:46.197]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:21:46.378 --> 00:21:47.739]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:21:47.879 --> 00:21:48.701]  Don't tread on me.
[00:21:48.961 --> 00:21:55.830]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:22:00.023 --> 00:22:09.768]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:22:10.048 --> 00:22:16.091]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:22:16.491 --> 00:22:25.335]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:22:25.715 --> 00:22:34.627]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:22:34.907 --> 00:22:39.493]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:22:39.914 --> 00:22:41.075]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:41.316 --> 00:22:43.819]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[00:22:44.079 --> 00:22:45.580]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.242]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[00:22:51.582 --> 00:22:52.443]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.463 --> 00:22:52.843]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.086 --> 00:23:04.928]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[00:23:05.308 --> 00:23:05.648]  Listen.
[00:23:06.008 --> 00:23:10.009]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:13.311]  Two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[00:23:13.671 --> 00:23:16.512]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[00:23:16.732 --> 00:23:20.093]  They wanted me to go on Plavix but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[00:23:20.498 --> 00:23:28.730]  Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[00:23:28.911 --> 00:23:31.334]  Within the first month I felt a dramatic difference.
[00:23:31.474 --> 00:23:35.841]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced and within two months I felt completely normal.
[00:23:36.061 --> 00:23:39.903]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:40.263 --> 00:23:44.125]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.
[00:23:44.485 --> 00:23:48.867]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:48.887 --> 00:23:49.387]  Call 866-295-5305.
[00:23:49.407 --> 00:23:50.788]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:24:03.311 --> 00:24:05.792]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:24:06.332 --> 00:24:09.093]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:09.473 --> 00:24:13.014]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:24:13.034 --> 00:24:17.516]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:24:18.076 --> 00:24:22.097]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[00:24:22.137 --> 00:24:31.841]  By the way, Dr. Paul Greg Roberts, who sends us his columns to publish at InfoWars.com, two days ago sent us The Year America Dissolved.
[00:24:33.197 --> 00:24:35.418]  And Drudge had that as his top link this morning.
[00:24:35.478 --> 00:24:39.000]  It's now moved down to the right-hand column, second story down.
[00:24:39.881 --> 00:24:50.187]  But amazing to have the Drudge report link to a hardcore report forecasting the way this country could possibly collapse.
[00:24:50.767 --> 00:24:52.048]  Mexico has collapsed.
[00:24:52.088 --> 00:24:55.090]  North Korea has officially collapsed and is a failed state.
[00:24:55.510 --> 00:25:00.233]  And the bigger the empire and the more overextended it is, the worse the collapse will be.
[00:25:00.293 --> 00:25:01.754]  This is a serious
[00:25:02.554 --> 00:25:02.674]  Yes.
[00:25:23.942 --> 00:25:30.568]  DrudgeReport, DrudgeReport.com, LinkingToPrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com stories.
[00:25:31.108 --> 00:25:52.325]  Well, you know I've talked a lot about this in the last decade because I remember reading Pentagon reports and others that we've cited where they said using search engines and using NSA data mining of your cell phone calls, where you travel, tracking your cell phone by GPS, using face scanning cameras, license plate reading cameras,
[00:25:53.266 --> 00:26:22.527]  uh... that they can predict currently with over ninety three percent accuracy where you're going to travel what you're going to do just off of uh... your past movements with your cell phone uh... personal tracker system and that's what the telecommunications act of ninety six stated it was for they can also dial in and listen to you without warrants track you in real time the CIA run top secret america
[00:26:23.007 --> 00:26:26.889]  Fusion centers that are really federalization, internationalization centers.
[00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:31.572]  Police can dial in in real time and pinpoint exactly where you are.
[00:26:32.032 --> 00:26:33.273]  This is the control grid.
[00:26:34.293 --> 00:26:49.982]  But more importantly, with RFID and smart dust going into most of the products, they admit that it will create a Google-like searchability of not just cyberspace, but the real third dimension plane that we live on.
[00:26:51.158 --> 00:27:12.831]  And with the face scanning, the cell phone tracking, the transponders, with your Google searches, with your Yahoo searches, and now with the NSA routing all internet traffic through their hubs, all internet activity, and now most business is being conducted on the web, everything's being integrated through the web, it is the worldwide wiretap.
[00:27:13.312 --> 00:27:17.915]  And they now admit this, but here is Wired Magazine today,
[00:27:19.212 --> 00:27:21.313]  Wired online, exclusive.
[00:27:21.333 --> 00:27:27.335]  It's like saying exclusive, the sky is blue, but I guess it is exclusive for them, they just learned this.
[00:27:27.975 --> 00:27:33.457]  Exclusive Google, CIA invest in future of web monitoring.
[00:27:34.118 --> 00:27:40.540]  And it says the investment arm of the CIA and Google are both backing a company that monitors the web in real time.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.942]  And says it uses the information to predict the future.
[00:27:46.277 --> 00:27:48.298]  And, of course, this comes out of MIT.
[00:27:48.838 --> 00:27:50.739]  Google was founded out of MIT.
[00:27:51.379 --> 00:27:54.561]  In-Q-Tel is an admitted CIA front.
[00:27:55.501 --> 00:27:56.202]  It's not even a front.
[00:27:56.222 --> 00:28:03.925]  They admit it's a CIA investment arm that's funded much of Google and other major systems, giving them government keyword software.
[00:28:04.186 --> 00:28:09.728]  It's NSA echelon search systems that Yahoo and Google and others are based on.
[00:28:10.068 --> 00:28:13.070]  And so they give these technologies that taxpayers paid to develop
[00:28:14.104 --> 00:28:15.626]  They were supposedly for the Cold War.
[00:28:16.286 --> 00:28:24.796]  They give these just select insider corporations and then basically they just grow up together and control the infrastructure and architecture of the web.
[00:28:24.996 --> 00:28:29.541]  They're now phasing us into Internet 2, a fully controlled, censored control grid.
[00:28:31.015 --> 00:28:32.936]  But I want to throw out the problems with this.
[00:28:33.196 --> 00:28:36.177]  Number one, remember what they said two months ago in the Washington Post.
[00:28:36.197 --> 00:28:38.497]  They finally admitted it in spy talk column.
[00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:43.879]  The CIA said we fake Bin Laden videos and the famous Bin Laden video is fake.
[00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:46.300]  We already knew that but they admitted it.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.981]  See, they can plant fake info.
[00:28:49.482 --> 00:28:57.827]  They can claim that the predictive pre-crime systems they've developed show that you're going to commit a crime.
[00:28:58.448 --> 00:29:05.552]  And the FBI is now saying they've shifted from responding to crime to fighting crime before it happens, or terror before it happens.
[00:29:06.093 --> 00:29:16.480]  And in this article, they go, oh, this former special forces commander just so happens to run this new company, and he's working with the CIA, kind of like a former special forces colonel runs the
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.242]  Carbon tax initiative here in Austin.
[00:29:19.262 --> 00:29:20.103]  That was in the Statesman.
[00:29:20.503 --> 00:29:23.166]  Oh, he was with Special Ops and the CIA.
[00:29:23.466 --> 00:29:27.070]  This colonel now is going to run Austin and all the green jobs.
[00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.612]  That means taking over your property, your factory, everything.
[00:29:30.093 --> 00:29:32.035]  This is part of the infrastructure takeover.
[00:29:32.255 --> 00:29:34.457]  Top secret USA.
[00:29:34.477 --> 00:29:39.142]  854,000 private operatives with the highest level security clearance.
[00:29:39.662 --> 00:29:44.809]  We're going to talk about how it all integrates together and how this is a giant frame-up system straight ahead.
[00:29:44.849 --> 00:29:46.771]  It's not really a crystal ball.
[00:29:47.071 --> 00:29:47.572]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:51.156]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.657 --> 00:29:53.259]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.864]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.137 --> 00:30:02.678]  Thousands of Americans are facing evacuation.
[00:30:02.978 --> 00:30:07.980]  If you or any of your loved ones might need to evacuate, you must do it yourselves.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.821]  Please don't procrastinate until they do it for you.
[00:30:11.061 --> 00:30:14.563]  Remember the terrible conditions of those that didn't get out for Katrina.
[00:30:14.743 --> 00:30:20.745]  Go right now to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633 for information on the new evacuation pack.
[00:30:24.947 --> 00:30:30.049]  It contains two weeks of delicious easy-to-fix food along with the equipment to prepare it.
[00:30:30.369 --> 00:30:33.230]  It's packed in a rugged heavy-duty tote for transport.
[00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:37.691]  Evacuations are looming with the storms and the Gulf oil catastrophe.
[00:30:37.851 --> 00:30:42.893]  No matter where you live, wildfires, earthquakes, floods, and storms must be escaped.
[00:30:43.173 --> 00:30:46.794]  Don't be like a deer frozen in the headlights of oncoming disaster.
[00:30:47.034 --> 00:30:49.055]  At least prepare yourself with this two-week
[00:30:49.155 --> 00:30:49.856]  We're good to go.
[00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:04.469]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:31:04.589 --> 00:31:05.349]  What have we got?
[00:31:05.589 --> 00:31:07.711]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:31:08.031 --> 00:31:08.772]  A republic.
[00:31:09.032 --> 00:31:11.614]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:31:11.694 --> 00:31:13.595]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:31:13.956 --> 00:31:15.857]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:31:15.977 --> 00:31:17.238]  So they think they own our land?
[00:31:17.658 --> 00:31:18.779]  They think they own our water?
[00:31:18.979 --> 00:31:19.380]  Children?
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.360]  Our education?
[00:31:20.701 --> 00:31:21.321]  Our money?
[00:31:21.521 --> 00:31:25.184]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:31:25.544 --> 00:31:29.188]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:31.331]  We have the facts.
[00:31:31.551 --> 00:31:32.652]  We have the Constitution.
[00:31:32.692 --> 00:31:33.594]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:31:33.614 --> 00:31:34.435]  We have common law.
[00:31:34.495 --> 00:31:36.757]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:37.018 --> 00:31:40.802]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:31:40.902 --> 00:31:45.687]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:31:45.847 --> 00:31:47.228]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:31:47.348 --> 00:31:48.189]  Don't tread on me.

[00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:17.611]  The workers.
[00:33:17.631 --> 00:33:20.673]  The strivers.
[00:33:20.713 --> 00:33:21.634]  The builders.
[00:33:23.395 --> 00:33:25.517]  These are our people.
[00:33:25.577 --> 00:33:27.899]  Who are they?
[00:33:30.163 --> 00:33:32.965]  They are the dark armies.
[00:33:33.025 --> 00:33:36.988]  The dark, murdering armies whose only honor is atrocity.
[00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:38.089]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:38.129 --> 00:33:39.830]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:00.489 --> 00:34:01.903]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:08.839]  So, breaking this down.
[00:34:09.559 --> 00:34:21.483]  In the last 30 years, conservatively, there's been a covert, secret, federal program to take over the state houses, the county sheriff's departments, the police departments, the city councils.
[00:34:21.843 --> 00:34:28.225]  The UN has been involved for at least 40 years with what they call munialization, or sister city deals.
[00:34:28.585 --> 00:34:34.527]  Where, oh, Austin has a sister city in Japan, and...
[00:34:37.088 --> 00:34:40.332]  Pittsburgh has a sister city with Russian cities.
[00:34:41.533 --> 00:34:57.983]  And they have these exchange programs and they have these threat fusion centers and then you find that the sheriffs, the police chiefs are part of these international think tanks where they get vetted and chosen and in some cases sent for several years to be vetted in D.C.
[00:34:58.163 --> 00:34:58.943]  or at the U.N.
[00:34:59.304 --> 00:35:07.749]  Art Acevedo, who was in the Dallas Morning News, was vetted and recommended by the federal government to be the new police chief of Dallas.
[00:35:08.029 --> 00:35:09.230]  It's not clear if he's going to get that.
[00:35:10.492 --> 00:35:12.614]  But this is how they control everything.
[00:35:12.934 --> 00:35:15.858]  This is how they come in and take control of your city, your county, your state.
[00:35:16.158 --> 00:35:17.579]  You are supposedly the government.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.381]  You are supposedly the sovereign.
[00:35:19.742 --> 00:35:21.063]  You are supposedly the people.
[00:35:21.984 --> 00:35:23.746]  But no, they're everywhere.
[00:35:23.766 --> 00:35:28.131]  And now they admit, what we told you years ago, and it's a lot more than what the Washington Post says, 800
[00:35:31.468 --> 00:35:33.589]  And 54,000 private spies.
[00:35:34.009 --> 00:35:38.530]  That's private spies, ladies and gentlemen, in the private sector.
[00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:47.351]  But if you look at these people, they're all former FBI, DEA, Special Forces, CIA, and other covert federal agencies.
[00:35:47.371 --> 00:35:57.153]  And then above that, if you look at who your city managers are in the big cities, they're almost all former Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup.
[00:35:57.193 --> 00:35:59.154]  Those are all private shareholders in the Federal Reserve.
[00:35:59.354 --> 00:35:59.754]  There's only
[00:36:00.114 --> 00:36:00.414]  Six.
[00:36:01.995 --> 00:36:03.195]  And this is your government.
[00:36:03.335 --> 00:36:08.597]  It's run by banks, it's run by insurance companies, and then they bring in spies.
[00:36:08.937 --> 00:36:19.721]  They bring in people with high-level security clearances to sit in those government positions and corporate positions in your towns and cities so they can carry out their robberies and their crimes.
[00:36:20.081 --> 00:36:24.123]  I go back to this huge 15-page report from
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:31.793]  Bloomberg today, fallen soldiers' families denied cash as insurers profit.
[00:36:32.254 --> 00:36:33.476]  And in the article they admit
[00:36:34.807 --> 00:36:42.110]  That these insurance companies just keep the insurance policies, all of it, and the federal regulators say, that's okay, you're allowed to steal the money.
[00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:44.310]  I mean, this is just another example.
[00:36:44.511 --> 00:36:48.872]  Go read it for yourself how hard core criminal these people are.
[00:36:49.152 --> 00:36:55.275]  But they run almost all your sheriffs and police chiefs and city managers and they run the people for mayor and they run it all.
[00:36:55.575 --> 00:37:01.857]  And they're going to keep raising your taxes and they're going to pass laws to shut down your factories so only their buddies are allowed to have factories.
[00:37:02.157 --> 00:37:04.078]  This is monopoly crony
[00:37:04.778 --> 00:37:05.479]  Fascism.
[00:37:06.519 --> 00:37:09.041]  This is a scientific corporate takeover.
[00:37:10.702 --> 00:37:13.765]  Now, going back to Google, this is so important.
[00:37:14.545 --> 00:37:15.226]  Here they are.
[00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:19.511]  admitting that the CIA is funding.
[00:37:20.031 --> 00:37:20.831]  They already have this.
[00:37:20.851 --> 00:37:22.191]  This is just the public rollout.
[00:37:22.492 --> 00:37:31.254]  Oh, there's a private company Google and the CIA are buying together and it's going to track what you do on the web in real time and it says predict the future.
[00:37:31.894 --> 00:37:33.175]  Let me show people on the document cam.
[00:37:33.375 --> 00:37:34.695]  Predict the future.
[00:37:35.075 --> 00:37:35.435]  Right there.
[00:37:35.495 --> 00:37:36.836]  Predict the future.
[00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:39.416]  But here's the issue.
[00:37:39.476 --> 00:37:41.157]  You then read further into this
[00:37:42.165 --> 00:37:43.526]  And they've got a video on there.
[00:37:43.546 --> 00:37:44.947]  In fact, guys, grab that for me.
[00:37:45.307 --> 00:37:51.811]  In this Wired article, they've got a link to a YouTube put out by the CIA company, the CIA Front.
[00:37:51.851 --> 00:37:52.712]  It's not even a front.
[00:37:52.732 --> 00:37:53.492]  Again, they just admit it.
[00:37:54.193 --> 00:38:04.219]  Where they go, oh, we're tracking Al-Qaeda and Taliban terrorists on message boards and on the web and their emails, and we can predict when they're going to strike.
[00:38:04.559 --> 00:38:07.181]  There's just one big, giant problem with this.
[00:38:07.941 --> 00:38:14.964]  This is a government and a CIA that admittedly puts out fake Bin Laden and Adam Gadahn videos.
[00:38:15.344 --> 00:38:15.825]  Admittedly.
[00:38:16.205 --> 00:38:17.405]  They admit they've done it now.
[00:38:18.166 --> 00:38:20.627]  They're like, oh, Mr. Jones, you're going to expose us?
[00:38:20.867 --> 00:38:33.613]  The public are such stupid slaves, we're going to admit to them in the Washington Post and Wired Magazine, a separate article about fake Adam Gadahn videos two years ago, we're just going to admit we're lying to them.
[00:38:34.889 --> 00:38:36.090]  And so the whole thing's a lie.
[00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:38.872]  It says this software is to stop Al-Qaeda and Taliban.
[00:38:39.132 --> 00:38:43.596]  They would never want to stop their Wahhabist terror arm they've used to overthrow country after country.
[00:38:43.856 --> 00:38:46.958]  Whether it's Kosovo or what's happening in Iran right now.
[00:38:47.379 --> 00:38:48.379]  They run these people.
[00:38:48.579 --> 00:38:49.800]  They created these people.
[00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:52.743]  So to say that this system is for them is a lie.
[00:38:53.023 --> 00:38:55.104]  Number one, it's pointed at you.
[00:38:55.945 --> 00:38:58.386]  We've got their internal MYAC and Homeland Security reports.
[00:38:58.746 --> 00:39:05.408]  It's for you, you, the average person, to understand what you're thinking, what you're doing, and how to counter you.
[00:39:05.588 --> 00:39:12.730]  So when they see a political trend, they can see it from far away with 20-20 vision, and then start trying to sabotage it.
[00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:24.813]  They've got admitted cybersecurity disinfo systems, where automatic troll computers go out when a story is trending, and then they demonize and attack whoever the patriot is that's fighting the establishment.
[00:39:25.606 --> 00:39:27.787]  Or they can automatically generate disinfo.
[00:39:28.127 --> 00:39:32.990]  This is computerized information warfare against you, the American people.
[00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:35.431]  So A, they claim this is for Taliban and Al Qaeda.
[00:39:35.451 --> 00:39:36.272]  That's a complete lie.
[00:39:37.318 --> 00:39:40.100]  B, they're constantly putting fake data out.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:47.345]  They're constantly having the CIA put fake videos out or go put fake statements on message boards that's taken as gospel from Bin Laden.
[00:39:47.665 --> 00:39:56.851]  It's a microcosm of the WikiLeaks, which most of the 19,000 documents that have been put out and that the media's run with, deals with, oh, Hamid Ghul!
[00:39:57.211 --> 00:39:58.772]  He's behind the terror attacks!
[00:39:59.052 --> 00:40:01.174]  Oh, Pakistan's running Al-Qaeda!
[00:40:02.102 --> 00:40:02.805]  And Taliban?
[00:40:02.845 --> 00:40:07.623]  Well, Pakistan intelligence was run by the CIA and British intelligence and did create it.
[00:40:09.343 --> 00:40:11.184]  But they want to go into Pakistan now.
[00:40:11.284 --> 00:40:14.985]  So they use a leak that I believe they put out to sell all this.
[00:40:15.025 --> 00:40:16.805]  So they fill the web with disinfo.
[00:40:17.145 --> 00:40:19.086]  They claim, oh look, there was this chatter.
[00:40:19.386 --> 00:40:26.068]  They tell the compartmentalized corporate and government and private sector people the lie that they can predict terror attacks.
[00:40:26.108 --> 00:40:37.711]  And then the police show up at your door saying the intel shows you're planning an attack from your activities, which they've been watching in real time, not even a pretense of having a Fourth Amendment.
[00:40:38.601 --> 00:40:42.844]  Just open, naked, total surveillance in live time.
[00:40:43.384 --> 00:40:45.925]  It is illegal to have the CIA doing this.
[00:40:46.306 --> 00:40:48.567]  It is illegal to have the FBI doing this.
[00:40:48.847 --> 00:40:53.110]  It is illegal to have them involved in your local cities running the threat fusion centers.
[00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:54.931]  And that's been admitted all over the news.
[00:40:55.231 --> 00:40:59.733]  Oh, the CIA is advising the threat fusion centers and has officers in every major city.
[00:40:59.974 --> 00:41:00.974]  That's illegal!
[00:41:01.374 --> 00:41:03.336]  They say, well, we better do this.
[00:41:04.383 --> 00:41:05.663]  To keep everybody safe.
[00:41:05.703 --> 00:41:10.705]  You know, we've got to do this to keep you safe, America.
[00:41:12.065 --> 00:41:28.831]  America, the corporations that have taken over our government for at least 30 years have quietly spent hundreds of billions of your taxpayer money funding their complete and total takeover of every facet and level of society.
[00:41:29.451 --> 00:41:32.212]  They have been out there recruiting the preachers.
[00:41:33.342 --> 00:41:36.843]  They have been out there recruiting everyone.
[00:41:37.344 --> 00:41:41.485]  They have been slowly going and paying their preachers.
[00:41:41.525 --> 00:41:43.966]  Now over 50,000 in the clergy response teams.
[00:41:43.986 --> 00:41:46.687]  We told you two years, three years before it was even mainstream news.
[00:41:46.867 --> 00:41:48.448]  We got the secret documents from a pastor.
[00:41:48.648 --> 00:41:49.468]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:41:49.488 --> 00:41:51.429]  I mean, how creepy and evil is that?
[00:41:51.809 --> 00:41:59.072]  To have the government, the government with your tax money, secretly paying off 50 plus thousand.
[00:41:59.272 --> 00:42:00.973]  That's the last time we got intel three years ago.
[00:42:01.872 --> 00:42:03.293]  We learned six years ago about this.
[00:42:03.573 --> 00:42:05.894]  Three years ago was the last time the government made any admissions.
[00:42:06.175 --> 00:42:09.957]  It was over 50,000 preachers, and they plan to double it the next year.
[00:42:09.977 --> 00:42:19.723]  50,000 preachers, with the training manuals, go to the FEMA camp, turn your guns in, take the inoculations when you're told.
[00:42:20.603 --> 00:42:25.927]  They've been federalizing police, brainwashing them, turning against us, running former federal agents.
[00:42:26.747 --> 00:42:54.898]  for sheriff having federal funded think tanks that promote and promise taxpayer money to the cities and states and counties if they put certain police chiefs in place most of these police chiefs are intelligence operatives not of the CIA that's only one hat they wear you ever seen romancing the stone uh... where the evil guy what's his name zero or something and every time they see him in south america he's wearing a new uniform
[00:42:56.144 --> 00:42:58.106]  That's how real tyrannies work.
[00:42:58.927 --> 00:43:04.092]  They're CIA, they're FBI, they're InfraGarde, they're Clergy Response, they're corporate.
[00:43:04.312 --> 00:43:06.955]  They've got the highest security clearances.
[00:43:07.255 --> 00:43:12.720]  When they open up their wallet, it's just badges falling out of everything they can do.
[00:43:12.981 --> 00:43:13.881]  All of it illegal.
[00:43:14.362 --> 00:43:15.223]  All of it criminal.
[00:43:16.892 --> 00:43:35.754]  In the last three years, we've gone from George W. Bush lying and saying, we do not spy on any Americans without warrants, we only look at foreign intel with the NSA, to him being admittedly a liar, to Congress saying, okay, well you can have limited spying without warrants if it's foreign intel coming into domestic phone lines.
[00:43:36.735 --> 00:43:36.976]  Again!
[00:43:39.923 --> 00:43:41.504]  Where's my Washington Post article?
[00:43:41.544 --> 00:43:50.087]  I just had it here in front of me in the stack where they just come right out and says, hey, the White House proposes everything in real time.
[00:43:50.568 --> 00:43:53.949]  Any computer records we want, you've got to turn them over to us.
[00:43:54.009 --> 00:43:57.150]  You've got to save all your computer records forever indefinitely.
[00:43:58.091 --> 00:44:02.232]  And anybody's private computer we want into, we're going to go into it under Cybersecurity Act.
[00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:02.853]  That's all this is.
[00:44:03.573 --> 00:44:04.333]  That's all this is.
[00:44:05.014 --> 00:44:16.598]  All ISPs, even down to small ISPs that have a hundred customers, and all private computers, will have software that tracks everything you do and censors what you can see.
[00:44:17.099 --> 00:44:23.281]  This makes the East German Stasi, the greatest police state on earth, look like choir boys.
[00:44:23.921 --> 00:44:29.043]  This is child's play what went on in the 60s, 70s and 80s in East Germany.
[00:44:30.064 --> 00:44:32.385]  That horrible fusion of the Nazis and the Communists.
[00:44:33.206 --> 00:44:37.049]  When the Soviets took over in 1945 East Germany.
[00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:43.653]  White House proposal would ease FBI access to records of Internet activity.
[00:44:44.954 --> 00:45:01.486]  The Obama administration is seeking to make it easier for the FBI to compel companies to turn over records of an individual Internet activity without a court order if agents deem the information relevant to a terrorist or intelligence or intelligence investigation.
[00:45:03.021 --> 00:45:05.824]  What does the Violent Belligerence Act say?
[00:45:05.924 --> 00:45:22.419]  It says, oh, we're going to fight terrorists, and for any reason fighting terrorism, the Pentagon, the Justice Department can secretly arrest citizens and give you enhanced interrogation, that's torture, and have you disappear forever with no trial, and only an act of Congress can even find out where you are.
[00:45:23.769 --> 00:45:24.509]  And you don't believe me?
[00:45:24.549 --> 00:45:25.130]  Go read the bill.
[00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:27.090]  I've had Ron Paul on about it and Napolitano.
[00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:28.511]  They've concurred with my analysis.
[00:45:29.151 --> 00:45:34.194]  But it says, if we think you may be a terrorist, or for any intelligence purpose.
[00:45:35.514 --> 00:45:43.057]  And so whether it's cyber security, which passed out a committee, or whether it's the Violent Belligerence Act, it's all the same wording.
[00:45:43.278 --> 00:45:45.719]  This is all an integrated, complete takeover.
[00:45:45.759 --> 00:45:52.762]  And now they've got paid private mercenaries in plain clothes, including shorts and shirts, to make it look shocking to people.
[00:45:53.615 --> 00:45:58.577]  Grabbing people and putting them in dark blue and black vans, throwing bags over their heads.
[00:45:58.957 --> 00:46:07.941]  Robb Due was in a military base, an old armory they were using as a prison, in Pittsburgh, when he got arrested at the G20 for filming.
[00:46:08.201 --> 00:46:08.761]  For filming?
[00:46:09.462 --> 00:46:10.382]  The arrest was on tape.
[00:46:10.902 --> 00:46:12.443]  He was on a hillside filming arrest.
[00:46:12.783 --> 00:46:14.264]  They came up and said, come here, you're going to jail.
[00:46:15.575 --> 00:46:19.276]  And when he got there, he saw people being taken off trucks with bags on their heads.
[00:46:19.537 --> 00:46:20.997]  Now, what did you see at the G20?
[00:46:21.297 --> 00:46:25.019]  What did you see at the G20 in Toronto a month ago?
[00:46:25.479 --> 00:46:34.302]  You saw people, random activists, grabbed by men in plain clothes, throwing them into vans and bags being put over their head.
[00:46:34.522 --> 00:46:35.863]  They're just getting you acclimated.
[00:46:37.005 --> 00:46:41.527]  Get right out in front of you to see people being grabbed off the streets with bags being put over their head.
[00:46:41.927 --> 00:46:45.549]  You're being acclimated that, okay, the CIA puts out fake videos.
[00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:46.329]  What are you going to do about it?
[00:46:46.809 --> 00:46:48.710]  Okay, the CIA runs your local police department.
[00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:49.470]  What are you going to do about it?
[00:46:50.071 --> 00:46:54.953]  And they're training the police officers to lock down cities and do door-to-door gun confiscations.
[00:46:54.973 --> 00:46:58.774]  That's admitted in Illinois, in New York, and in Austin, Texas.
[00:46:59.034 --> 00:47:02.056]  And they've got military checkpoints all over the country.
[00:47:02.816 --> 00:47:09.657]  Where they tell the locals, oh it's a drunk driving checkpoint, the marines are helping, or there was a shooting, armed marines are on the streets.
[00:47:11.758 --> 00:47:30.401]  This is a complete long-term strategic corporate takeover while the banks took over the states, the cities, while they got the cities to invest in derivatives, while they paid everybody off, while they got their own police chiefs and sheriffs in position, they've got their people in position, the population's waking up and getting upset, we're trying to get good sheriffs elected,
[00:47:31.161 --> 00:47:32.202]  We're supposed to run the country.
[00:47:32.222 --> 00:47:32.822]  We're the people.
[00:47:32.962 --> 00:47:33.703]  We're supposed to vote.
[00:47:34.063 --> 00:47:35.544]  We're trying to get good mayors in.
[00:47:35.744 --> 00:47:37.185]  We're trying to get good governors in.
[00:47:37.405 --> 00:47:38.386]  Good legislators in.
[00:47:38.806 --> 00:47:42.549]  And the feds are saying, if you're for states' rights, you're a violent terrorist that wants to kill cops.
[00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:48.493]  See, we recognize the covert, long-term, strategic takeover.
[00:47:48.794 --> 00:47:49.874]  Now they're bankrupting us.
[00:47:49.914 --> 00:47:53.237]  We always said the full takeover would happen when they instituted the depression.
[00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:55.671]  We're now going into the depression.
[00:47:55.891 --> 00:48:00.717]  They're now rolling all this out publicly that they quietly built over 30 plus years.
[00:48:01.618 --> 00:48:07.105]  I have tracked this back and told you exactly what was going on for 15 years on air.
[00:48:07.406 --> 00:48:11.891]  Not because I'm smart, but because I researched the information and I studied history.
[00:48:12.779 --> 00:48:25.281]  And let me tell you, what I saw the Soviets do in history, and the Nazis, and the Chaikoms, and Pol Pot is exactly what's going on, but literally a hundred times more sophisticated and more patient.
[00:48:25.561 --> 00:48:30.402]  These globalists, when they bring America down full, fully, they want to make sure they win.
[00:48:30.723 --> 00:48:33.463]  Because if they don't win, they are going to go down.
[00:48:33.683 --> 00:48:38.064]  They're all in, they're committed, and none of you are safe unless you fight back.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:48.723]  If you cower and think, well, I'll sit on the sidelines and play it safe, if you take the middle road, if you sit on the fence, if you're a spectator, that's what they're counting on, they are going to win.
[00:48:49.743 --> 00:49:07.009]  But if you become a leader and start speaking out at city council, calling in to talk radio, exposing your local police chief as a government spook, if you start exposing the real paradigm and if other officers start speaking out, and if people who understand what's happened start speaking out, and that's starting to happen,
[00:49:08.806 --> 00:49:20.650]  I mean, just Ron Paul, what, four months ago, in a big speech, said the CIA had a coup in 63, they shipped the drugs in, and we're completely run by the CIA, just like a third world country being overthrown, we've been overthrown.
[00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:24.211]  Now what did Chuck Baldwin say here two days ago?
[00:49:24.271 --> 00:49:25.331]  Exactly what I just said.
[00:49:26.744 --> 00:49:29.546]  What are all the real minds out there saying?
[00:49:29.726 --> 00:49:31.747]  They're finally concurring with my analysis.
[00:49:32.088 --> 00:49:33.128]  Because it's out in the open!
[00:49:33.809 --> 00:49:37.811]  And I don't blame some people for thinking I was a kook 15 years ago.
[00:49:38.272 --> 00:49:41.074]  Most people haven't read over a hundred books about World War II.
[00:49:41.754 --> 00:49:47.518]  Most people haven't read declassified 300-page long secret dossiers on Adolf Hitler.
[00:49:48.098 --> 00:49:51.441]  Most people haven't read secret dossiers that have been declassified on Joe Stalin.
[00:49:51.921 --> 00:49:56.444]  Most people haven't read secret Pentagon dossiers on the Masonic Movement in Germany.
[00:49:57.445 --> 00:49:59.946]  And how powerful that was, and how they were using it for intel.
[00:50:00.406 --> 00:50:05.950]  Most people didn't happen to pick up a history book when they were 12 and go, man, this is entertaining.
[00:50:07.211 --> 00:50:13.255]  But it was only entertaining until I was about 17, and then I started recognizing everything I'd read in history happening.
[00:50:14.229 --> 00:50:16.911]  Now, I recognize this from a hundred miles away.
[00:50:17.571 --> 00:50:18.812]  This isn't a hundred miles away.
[00:50:19.393 --> 00:50:20.413]  This is in your face.
[00:50:20.453 --> 00:50:21.774]  This is shoving you right now.
[00:50:22.195 --> 00:50:24.796]  Shoving you down in your seat saying, yeah, it's a tyranny.
[00:50:25.237 --> 00:50:26.658]  You better not talk about America.
[00:50:26.858 --> 00:50:28.119]  Better not talk about the Bill of Rights.
[00:50:28.319 --> 00:50:29.580]  Better not talk about the founders.
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.281]  Better not talk about states' rights.
[00:50:31.561 --> 00:50:33.723]  Better not talk about not wanting government health care.
[00:50:33.903 --> 00:50:36.004]  Better not talk about not liking the Federal Reserve.
[00:50:36.244 --> 00:50:37.565]  The Army's watching you.
[00:50:38.206 --> 00:50:39.767]  You better not come out to a tea party.
[00:50:39.967 --> 00:50:42.589]  The Army's there with sound cannons and microwave guns.
[00:50:43.752 --> 00:50:44.793]  Yeah, you're being watched.
[00:50:45.374 --> 00:50:46.335]  We got pre-crime.
[00:50:46.375 --> 00:50:47.376]  Sit down and shut up!
[00:50:48.497 --> 00:50:59.008]  While they take the dead veterans' insurance policies, all of it, they're so confident they're in the news taking the dead vets' money!
[00:51:00.475 --> 00:51:03.636]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:51:04.016 --> 00:51:05.837]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:51:06.297 --> 00:51:06.717]  Don't!
[00:51:07.177 --> 00:51:10.198]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:51:10.599 --> 00:51:17.741]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:51:17.721 --> 00:51:19.382]  's number one debt secret.
[00:51:19.702 --> 00:51:23.363]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.

[00:51:26.907 --> 00:51:33.955]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:51:34.275 --> 00:51:35.276]  Herb K was right.
[00:51:35.476 --> 00:51:38.500]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:39.540]  What do you have to lose?
[00:51:39.921 --> 00:51:40.881]  Stop the calls now.
[00:51:41.141 --> 00:51:42.862]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[00:51:43.102 --> 00:51:43.682]  Get Herb K.'

[00:52:02.491 --> 00:52:04.693]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:04.713 --> 00:52:07.635]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.035 --> 00:52:12.779]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:17.323]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:17.643 --> 00:52:19.966]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:19.986 --> 00:52:22.510]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:25.433]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:25.794 --> 00:52:33.404]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:33.724 --> 00:52:38.987]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.107 --> 00:52:41.388]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:41.428 --> 00:52:45.390]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:46.570]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:48.031]  You're everyone else.

[00:54:04.917 --> 00:54:28.176]  There is no doubt, it is a 100% fact that incredibly corrupt megabanks that own the military industrial complex, that control the intelligence agencies, they founded them,
[00:54:29.324 --> 00:54:37.207]  ...are in control of our society and have stolen $28 trillion from October 3rd, 2008 until January of this year.
[00:54:37.247 --> 00:54:39.308]  We haven't gotten new numbers in about seven months.
[00:54:40.128 --> 00:54:43.129]  Bloomberg and AP reported in January $28 trillion.
[00:54:45.742 --> 00:54:46.182]  28 trill.
[00:54:47.343 --> 00:54:48.363]  28 trill!
[00:54:48.884 --> 00:54:52.485]  You can just search the term 23.7 trillion missing.
[00:54:53.626 --> 00:54:56.727]  Bailout now 23.7.
[00:54:57.247 --> 00:54:58.848]  Bailout now 28 trillion.
[00:54:59.188 --> 00:55:01.629]  You can pull those articles up for yourself.
[00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:07.932]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've created over 600 trillion in fake derivatives according to the Washington Post.
[00:55:08.412 --> 00:55:13.855]  Our economists all concurrence over 1.5 quadrillion and that number is seven or eight months old.
[00:55:15.336 --> 00:55:18.819]  They have created hundreds of times more money than there is assets.
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:20.000]  Okay?
[00:55:20.321 --> 00:55:26.766]  They did a strategic plan for 30 years, profiting with scams as they took over, towards the mega-scam.
[00:55:27.627 --> 00:55:36.115]  And I can't even believe this Bloomberg report, even though I was aware of some of it, that they take the insurance policies, $400,000, $500,000, a million dollars, from the
[00:55:40.714 --> 00:55:41.895]  Widow of dead vets?
[00:55:41.935 --> 00:55:43.096]  I mean, it's all here!
[00:55:43.816 --> 00:55:44.817]  Fifteen page report!
[00:55:44.837 --> 00:55:46.918]  I'm going to cover it later, if I have time.
[00:55:46.938 --> 00:55:47.778]  It's fifteen pages.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:50.300]  Fifteen pages!
[00:55:51.161 --> 00:55:55.243]  And they're in there going, yes, it's illegal, but they run the regulators, no one can stop them.
[00:55:55.543 --> 00:55:57.525]  They changed the regulations so they could do this.
[00:55:59.726 --> 00:56:04.749]  They either took out insurance in people's names and kept it, or they just took people's insurance.
[00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:08.852]  Your husband, or your son, dies
[00:56:11.075 --> 00:56:12.177]  And then they take the money!
[00:56:14.381 --> 00:56:16.425]  Does that show you how bold these people are?
[00:56:17.398 --> 00:56:19.359]  Does that show you how dangerous they are?
[00:56:20.159 --> 00:56:22.160]  Does that show you that the sky's the limit?
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:26.321]  Police, listening to me, the government is totally evil!
[00:56:26.742 --> 00:56:38.206]  They give you all these cover stories for why you do what you do, but you know they're teaching you that the public's dangerous and wants to kill you and you've got to crack our heads and keep control of us and be in control of the situation.
[00:56:38.686 --> 00:56:44.969]  They're saying you're not going to respond to many crimes, but you're just there to raise money and be tax collectors and revenue generators.
[00:56:45.689 --> 00:56:49.122]  They lie about having quotas but now they admit, yeah, we've got quotas for money.
[00:56:53.413 --> 00:56:54.913]  I'm so sad that America's dying.
[00:56:56.014 --> 00:56:59.334]  And if there is an awakening now to just how bad it is, we've got a chance to turn the tide.
[00:56:59.374 --> 00:57:11.597]  But look how the bankers robbed us in the last two years, and then just last week passed the financial takeover bill to get the Federal Reserve total anonymity, total autonomy, total power over everything economic.
[00:57:12.037 --> 00:57:13.438]  Now let's see them try to enforce it.
[00:57:13.718 --> 00:57:22.780]  They may have passed campaign finance reform six years ago, saying I as a talk show host can't tell you how politicians voted six weeks before an election, but everybody just ignores it.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:24.881]  You know, they can claim they're God.
[00:57:25.541 --> 00:57:30.122]  It's kind of like the Supreme Court ruling that black people weren't humans, or were three-fifths human.
[00:57:30.842 --> 00:57:34.363]  Black people knew they were humans, and they just said, I'm not going to let you say I'm not human.
[00:57:34.744 --> 00:57:35.944]  I'm tired of being your slave.
[00:57:36.784 --> 00:57:42.846]  And the abolitionists that were 1% of the population in 1800, by 1860s, slavery was over.
[00:57:43.806 --> 00:57:45.587]  They just brought in new forms of slavery, though.
[00:57:46.502 --> 00:57:57.135]  You've got to when these crooks tell you, I'm going to take your pension fund, I'm going to take your insurance money, I'm going to raise taxes, I'm going to charge you for rainwater collection, I'm going to put toll roads on your existing roads.
[00:57:57.415 --> 00:57:59.377]  No, you stinking offshore criminal!
[00:58:01.463 --> 00:58:02.204]  Oh, man!
[00:58:03.425 --> 00:58:05.126]  It just, it even shocks me how bold they are.
[00:58:05.146 --> 00:58:05.787]  We're going to break.
[00:58:05.807 --> 00:58:07.789]  I want to remind you this special ends Monday.
[00:58:08.209 --> 00:58:12.793]  You can get four copies of The Obama Deception for $19.95.
[00:58:13.293 --> 00:58:14.074]  That's four copies.
[00:58:14.174 --> 00:58:15.535]  One for yourself, three to give away.
[00:58:15.936 --> 00:58:18.318]  The most powerful film out there exposing the globalists.
[00:58:19.339 --> 00:58:20.059]  Part two of it.
[00:58:20.299 --> 00:58:21.200]  Fall of the Republic.
[00:58:21.641 --> 00:58:22.481]  Infowars.com.
[00:58:24.258 --> 00:58:26.579]  We've also got a donate button at the bottom of InfoWars.com.
[00:58:26.599 --> 00:58:28.700]  A lot of people ask, well, I just want to say they want to donate.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:32.362]  Well, it's at the bottom of InfoWars.com on the right-hand side.
[00:58:33.183 --> 00:58:35.244]  Whatever you do, get the books, the videos, the t-shirts.
[00:58:35.264 --> 00:58:36.925]  They're all available at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:36.965 --> 00:58:37.986]  God bless you for your support.
[00:58:38.226 --> 00:58:39.106]  Back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:41.528 --> 00:58:43.309]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:46.310]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:51.371]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.411 --> 00:58:54.234]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[00:58:54.795 --> 00:58:59.719]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[00:59:00.019 --> 00:59:03.182]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[00:59:03.462 --> 00:59:05.785]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:59:06.405 --> 00:59:07.286]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[00:59:09.948 --> 00:59:10.909]  Take my word for it.
[00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:13.410]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:59:13.751 --> 00:59:19.955]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:59:20.256 --> 00:59:21.657]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:59:25.059 --> 00:59:25.440]  Or call 1-800-340-7091.
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:26.801]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?

[00:59:48.057 --> 00:59:48.497]  Thank you.
[00:59:52.661 --> 00:59:54.602]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.042 --> 00:59:57.885]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.676 --> 01:00:05.316]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:07.018]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.758 --> 01:00:08.879]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.499 --> 01:00:10.320]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.081]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.641 --> 01:00:16.264]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.844 --> 01:00:20.947]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.988 --> 01:00:23.829]  Alright, we're now into hour number two.
[01:00:24.089 --> 01:00:27.251]  Birgitta Jones-Dantier is going to join us from 8 after to 40 after.
[01:00:27.752 --> 01:00:29.052]  Member of the Icelandic Parliament.
[01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:32.275]  She's worked with Mr. Assange.
[01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:35.051]  The founder of Wikileaks.
[01:00:36.373 --> 01:00:37.754]  And I've got a lot of questions for her.
[01:00:37.874 --> 01:00:43.919]  I think she's a great lady and we'll get her view on these big leaks that she said would shake the world a few weeks ago when she was on with us.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.862]  And it is a huge story, but I have questions for her.
[01:00:46.882 --> 01:00:56.471]  And then we've got Ray McGovern joining us, former top-level CIA analyst, to break down the situation with Iran, the war drums intensifying, the storm clouds gathering.
[01:00:57.674 --> 01:01:08.185]  The dogs of war cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war, as Shakespeare would say, is now becoming inexorable, inevitable, as Hayden, former head of the CIA, said last week.
[01:01:09.146 --> 01:01:19.456]  And then we've got, in the last 30 minutes of the show, popping in the father of the birther movement, Phil Berg, will be joining us to give us the latest big developments on that front.
[01:01:25.256 --> 01:01:34.420]  Some of the other news, I want to get into deals with the government just announcing, oh yes, we're going to take any stuff off your computer or from your ISP without warrants now.
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.360]  Does Congress say they're going to pass a law?
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:36.681]  No!
[01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:39.602]  Obama says that he's just going to do it on his own.
[01:01:40.441 --> 01:01:46.463]  He now operates outside of the law, kind of like Dick Cheney said he did, that he wasn't part of the executive, or the legislative, or the judicial.
[01:01:46.763 --> 01:01:48.364]  He just was his own person.
[01:01:48.624 --> 01:01:55.007]  He could order torture, and then when people got in trouble for it, they'd go to prison, and he'd brag about how he ordered the torture, and he wouldn't get in trouble.
[01:01:55.027 --> 01:02:03.410]  And then a month and a half ago, George Bush came out and said he'd order torture again, while all these people that followed orders and carried out the torture rot in prison.
[01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:08.672]  And I'm not saying they shouldn't be rotting in prison, but who really deserves to be rotting in prison is the question.
[01:02:09.497 --> 01:02:10.798]  Well, those that created the policies.
[01:02:10.858 --> 01:02:14.940]  John Yoo, Alberto Gonzales, Dick Cheney.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:19.942]  None of us are safe when this type of lawless evil is going on unabated.
[01:02:21.142 --> 01:02:31.667]  And at 40 After, when Birgitta Jones-Dottier leaves us, I'm going to play a clip from the Todd and Don Show that's on mornings on our local affiliate 590 AM.
[01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:33.861]  We're also
[01:02:55.461 --> 01:02:56.301]  I couldn't get out of the car.
[01:02:56.341 --> 01:03:01.143]  I was listening and this woman went on and on about, I want to give up all my rights so the terrorists will get me.
[01:03:01.483 --> 01:03:02.923]  The Constitution's bad.
[01:03:02.943 --> 01:03:04.344]  I want to be safe.
[01:03:04.424 --> 01:03:06.124]  Search my computer with no warrant.
[01:03:06.564 --> 01:03:08.225]  I don't have nothing to hide.
[01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:11.606]  It's that the corrupt system will use this to frame you.
[01:03:11.906 --> 01:03:13.386]  They will use this to set you up.
[01:03:13.686 --> 01:03:15.447]  They will use this to track everything you're doing.
[01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:21.889]  They'll use this for unfair trade advantage by gathering all this aggregate data and giving it to private corporations that run the government.
[01:03:22.754 --> 01:03:29.801]  So, that amazing call is coming up in about T-minus 37 minutes from now.
[01:03:30.561 --> 01:03:33.724]  But again, the websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:03:33.985 --> 01:03:45.576]  The last 30 seconds, the last hour, I plug the fact, I'm going to do it again right now before I go to our guest, that I released this film in March of last year, so more than a year and a half ago.
[01:03:47.096 --> 01:03:48.177]  I read it a year and a half ago.
[01:03:49.198 --> 01:03:51.480]  And it's the Obama deception, and it's been highly censored.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:56.083]  They've used a lot of dirty tricks to try to get it off the web, but it's still up there for free on YouTube and Google.
[01:03:56.323 --> 01:04:04.930]  But you need to see it in the highest quality, and it supports this broadcast and funds this info war against the tyranny with our secret weapon, the truth.
[01:04:07.112 --> 01:04:11.315]  And we need to get the truth out to everybody, and you can get four copies of this for $19.95.
[01:04:11.536 --> 01:04:15.079]  This special will end Monday evening.
[01:04:15.099 --> 01:04:16.620]  We're taking it down Monday evening.
[01:04:17.662 --> 01:04:26.925]  So, if you want to get 4 copies of this for $19.95, 10 copies for $39.95, that's $3.98 a piece, or they're $4 and change, when you get 4 of them.
[01:04:27.425 --> 01:04:28.466]  Available right now.
[01:04:29.126 --> 01:04:32.647]  Get a 4-pack, $19.95, and your purchase makes this broadcast possible.
[01:04:33.027 --> 01:04:34.988]  Infowars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:04:35.008 --> 01:04:35.048]  888-253-3139.
[01:04:35.128 --> 01:04:39.829]  You can also download all my films in the highest quality online and burn them to disk, give them to people.
[01:04:45.743 --> 01:04:47.085]  At PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:04:47.586 --> 01:04:50.451]  And Big Brother is afraid of this information.
[01:04:50.912 --> 01:04:56.381]  We couldn't do any of this without you buying the books, the t-shirts, the videos, and those that have PrisonPlanet.TV memberships.
[01:04:56.741 --> 01:04:57.543]  I salute you all.
[01:04:57.603 --> 01:04:58.104]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:03.932]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.253 --> 01:05:04.533]  Number 1.
[01:05:05.173 --> 01:05:08.315]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:08.595 --> 01:05:09.155]  Number 2.
[01:05:09.456 --> 01:05:13.998]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:14.338 --> 01:05:14.778]  It's true.
[01:05:15.079 --> 01:05:19.641]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:20.502]  Number 3.
[01:05:20.782 --> 01:05:24.064]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.364 --> 01:05:28.066]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.266 --> 01:05:28.827]  Number 4.
[01:05:29.067 --> 01:05:31.429]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:35.212]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:35.512 --> 01:05:35.713]  Number 5.
[01:05:36.293 --> 01:05:40.216]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:45.201]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:45.481 --> 01:05:49.526]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:49.666 --> 01:05:51.228]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:53.511]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:05:53.711 --> 01:05:56.054]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:05:59.935 --> 01:06:02.457]  Thousands of Americans are facing evacuation.
[01:06:02.757 --> 01:06:07.761]  If you or any of your loved ones might need to evacuate, you must do it yourselves.

[01:07:03.527 --> 01:07:04.448]  Tyranny is here.
[01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:08.313]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:07:08.653 --> 01:07:10.936]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:07:10.956 --> 01:07:16.403]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:07:16.823 --> 01:07:23.071]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:07:23.471 --> 01:07:29.013]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:07:29.454 --> 01:07:33.115]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:07:33.635 --> 01:07:37.597]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:07:37.917 --> 01:07:43.439]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:46.841]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:07:47.421 --> 01:07:48.861]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:07:49.402 --> 01:07:49.822]  It's here.

[01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:02.811]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:02.831 --> 01:08:06.173]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.393 --> 01:08:21.228]  Well, for the next 32 minutes or so, Birgitta Jones Dottier, who in just the last year and a half has been really the leader with her coalition in the Icelandic parliament defeating the banking looting.
[01:08:21.929 --> 01:08:24.211]  And that fight is ongoing, but she's had some great victories.
[01:08:24.271 --> 01:08:26.294]  I really admire her leadership.
[01:08:26.314 --> 01:08:26.834]  She's also
[01:08:27.455 --> 01:08:33.398]  In the film that we offer at Infowars.com, The Secret of Oz, how to counter these globalist bankers.
[01:08:33.878 --> 01:08:37.320]  But I wanted to get her on because we've never been able to get Julian Assange on the broadcast.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:38.441]  He's emailed us back and forth.
[01:08:38.941 --> 01:08:48.686]  And I think he's done great work releasing the gun pod footage from the Apaches from a few years ago with the slaughter of the Reuters reporters and shooting the kids up and the pilots laughing about it.
[01:08:49.636 --> 01:08:56.481]  They released, what, a year and a half ago, a secret Army manual for black ops, captains and above, how to stage false flag.
[01:08:57.601 --> 01:09:03.866]  But a lot of people I respect, like Tarpley, Webster Tarpley, and Wayne Madsen and others, they have concerns.
[01:09:04.646 --> 01:09:06.367]  But, you know, they might be wrong.
[01:09:07.388 --> 01:09:09.630]  And so that's why I want to have a discussion here.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.841]  Maybe it's how the media spun the 92,000 documents.
[01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:17.402]  Because Ray McGovern, who's coming later, he thinks this is really important and I respect him as well.
[01:09:17.422 --> 01:09:18.783]  I know he's for real.
[01:09:18.803 --> 01:09:26.406]  He's exposed the Gulf of Tonkin event they tried to stage a year before they did it under Cheney, right before they left office trying to start a war with Iran.
[01:09:27.206 --> 01:09:34.189]  But Hamid Ghul told us a year and a half ago when he contacted me to come on the show, the former head of Pakistani intelligence, I was shocked by it.
[01:09:35.249 --> 01:09:40.412]  He says now's not the time to come back on and email exchanges for some reason, but we're working on that.
[01:09:41.212 --> 01:09:54.919]  He did tell the major papers that this was a staged release, that they put out battlefield documents that a lot of times are filled with propaganda, fake body count numbers, things like that, to say that Hamid Gul is running the Taliban.
[01:09:55.379 --> 01:09:57.160]  He says, yeah, I did run it with the U.S.
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.841]  when, you know, we were fighting the Russians.
[01:09:59.421 --> 01:10:01.903]  But that's in the Washington Post, document leaked, part of U.S.
[01:10:01.943 --> 01:10:04.604]  plots as Pakistani ex-general with ties to Taliban.
[01:10:05.205 --> 01:10:13.069]  And I also am concerned that it says that the New York Times went to Obama weeks before when Assange had given him this info and got his permission.
[01:10:13.569 --> 01:10:13.870]  And so...
[01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:25.094]  Um, maybe that's the issue, that WikiLeaks didn't release this first to the public, they went to the Guardian, Der Spiegel, and the New York Times, and so maybe that's the issue, is how the mainstream media spun it.
[01:10:25.414 --> 01:10:29.675]  But, uh, Birgitta has, when he was in hiding a few months ago, was his spokesman for a time.
[01:10:29.955 --> 01:10:30.495]  She knows him.
[01:10:30.836 --> 01:10:34.437]  One time she was on with us, and he was in the background there, uh, via video Skype.
[01:10:34.457 --> 01:10:38.338]  So joining us from Reykjavik is, uh, Birgitta Jones-Dottir.
[01:10:38.378 --> 01:10:40.399]  Birgitta, what do you think of what I've just said?
[01:10:42.335 --> 01:10:51.277]  Well, you said a lot of things, and I understand the worries that some people have about this release.
[01:10:52.277 --> 01:11:00.739]  However, I can assure you that Julian Assange did not contact the Obama administration weeks before this leak.
[01:11:01.219 --> 01:11:06.120]  What happened was that a journalist approached him from The Guardian.
[01:11:07.268 --> 01:11:14.796]  about having an embargo and to work with the WikiLeaks on just going through this incredible amount of documents.
[01:11:17.038 --> 01:11:27.949]  However, I have had confirmation about that the New York Times actually went to the Obama administration two days prior to the actual leak.
[01:11:28.769 --> 01:11:31.271]  Well, let me just interrupt, then I'll shut up for a moment.
[01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:32.292]  I want to be clear.
[01:11:32.312 --> 01:11:39.478]  I don't know what I said, but if I misspoke, I meant to say the New York Times went to Obama, not Julian Assange.
[01:11:40.784 --> 01:11:47.329]  Well, I think that is quite important because he can't possibly go to the United States as things are.
[01:11:48.470 --> 01:12:09.487]  However, I think if we just look at it a little bit differently, or at least how I've been looking at it, because we did do an experiment here in Iceland when the Iraqi video was released by working with journalists and giving them an opportunity to work the background material while we were
[01:12:10.087 --> 01:12:17.450]  Working on making the video as accessible as possible for the general public.
[01:12:18.951 --> 01:12:27.555]  And that was actually quite successful in the sense that we managed to get all the necessary background information such as tracking down witnesses and finding the children.
[01:12:29.275 --> 01:12:45.445]  And just to make sure that this was not a falsified video and I do think that is very important that WikiLeaks does everything in their power to ensure that... So do you think the criticism could just be paranoia or maybe some people are a little bit jealous?
[01:12:47.890 --> 01:12:49.211]  Probably a mix of both.
[01:12:50.071 --> 01:12:58.774]  I think it is very important that they actually did go through all the files with experts in investigative journalism.
[01:12:59.555 --> 01:13:05.977]  Also to make sure that as little information would be there that would put lives at risk.
[01:13:08.398 --> 01:13:15.064]  And I've actually heard reports today that they did not manage to get out all the necessary information.
[01:13:15.104 --> 01:13:19.387]  And if that is true, that is of course very regrettable.
[01:13:20.148 --> 01:13:24.131]  I just also want to stress that I am not the spokesperson for WikiLeaks currently.
[01:13:24.151 --> 01:13:26.513]  I'm just speaking on behalf of myself here.
[01:13:26.653 --> 01:13:32.658]  No, but I mean, am I correct in saying while he was in hiding, what, a month or two ago, that you were for a period is what I'm saying?
[01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:34.171]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:13:34.351 --> 01:13:44.240]  I did decide to stick my neck out because somebody needed to be accessible if the media or others needed to get some information.
[01:13:44.621 --> 01:13:46.843]  Well, Birgitta, we salute you on that front.
[01:13:47.343 --> 01:13:54.570]  But I think the concerns do have some validity only in that we know the media is spinning this towards
[01:13:55.231 --> 01:14:01.593]  An escalation of forces that they now admit... The thing is, you can't hold Wikileaks responsible for how the media chooses to spin it.
[01:14:01.613 --> 01:14:02.474]  No, I agree with you.
[01:14:02.874 --> 01:14:10.516]  Now it is our, the citizens and the people that are working, like you and others, with more of a social media.
[01:14:10.916 --> 01:14:20.920]  It is our responsibility to make sure that we spin it on the correct path and to base it on the information that is found in these documents.
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:34.010]  And, you know, one of the things that I find to be very important, and many people have forgotten the warning that the Russians gave NATO before NATO decided to attack in Afghanistan, and that is you're never going to win this war.
[01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:38.133]  And from these documents you can see that this is an unwinnable war.
[01:14:38.193 --> 01:14:39.394]  You cannot win this war.
[01:14:39.935 --> 01:14:46.260]  So I think it does raise valid questions as, you know, Obama promised to pull the troops out.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.762]  I can't see that that is actually happening.
[01:14:49.442 --> 01:15:00.152]  So they're always, didn't you just pass a huge bill with a huge amount of money to carry on the war effort in Afghanistan while your nation is suffering from poverty and starvation?
[01:15:00.793 --> 01:15:07.118]  It's just, it should be an encouragement for Mr. Obama to carry on with the plan that he promised.
[01:15:07.919 --> 01:15:10.282]  This nation, your nation, before he was elected.
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:30.463]  Towards an attack or an escalation of military forces inside Pakistan.
[01:15:30.843 --> 01:15:31.864]  And what do you expect them to do?
[01:15:32.024 --> 01:15:42.350]  I agree the documents that I've looked over, and of course I haven't had time to read much of it, I mean I've read quite a bit, but there's 92,000 documents, does show a clear picture of an unwinnable war.
[01:15:42.730 --> 01:15:49.194]  And so I think that you have a lot of courage even, you know, being affiliated as a spokesman for a while when he was in Kamenikato.
[01:15:49.634 --> 01:15:51.495]  And I think Mr. Assange has a lot of courage.
[01:15:51.555 --> 01:15:52.695]  I've praised him in the past.
[01:15:53.116 --> 01:15:57.037]  I've just been confused by a lot of people that I respect having their concerns.
[01:15:57.578 --> 01:16:09.763]  Well, you had Mike John Young on and I am thoroughly shocked by the way he has been using his website just to publish slander from somebody claiming to be a WikiLeaks insider.
[01:16:10.684 --> 01:16:14.327]  Just from the stuff related to things that I've been doing.
[01:16:14.347 --> 01:16:18.730]  I mean, there's a lot of slander about me and my movement in the Parliament there as well.
[01:16:19.071 --> 01:16:24.635]  Claiming, for example, that we are funding Wikileaks, which is so ludicrous because we don't have any money.
[01:16:25.576 --> 01:16:30.921]  Well, I mean, Birgitta, I think you're a wonderful person and you've borne great fruits, so I was not aware of that.
[01:16:31.621 --> 01:16:38.207]  But, I mean, let's talk about, from what you know about Wikileaks, what you take away from this incredible information.
[01:16:39.625 --> 01:16:45.190]  Well, from this particular leak or just in general... No, just overall.
[01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:56.719]  Overall, I think Wikibix is incredibly important in the sense that there is no other place in the world currently that offers such incredible protection for sources.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:06.788]  And so, there has been... If you just go through the website and look at some of the documents that are there, you realize how incredibly sad it is
[01:17:07.228 --> 01:17:10.890]  How the mainstream media has completely ignored some of these important leaks.
[01:17:11.770 --> 01:17:20.494]  And I think maybe this experiment with the mainstream media puts WikiLeaks on the agenda.
[01:17:21.134 --> 01:17:25.256]  Gets it into the mainstream media to get more attention to what is actually being leaked.
[01:17:25.316 --> 01:17:26.437]  I think that is important.
[01:17:27.097 --> 01:17:35.581]  I think it is important that journalists in general start to work together because everywhere you see funds being sliced when it comes to investigative journalism.
[01:17:36.441 --> 01:17:51.465]  And if we ever have needed investigation into the big corporations, into the military machine, into corrupt governments, we need it now because we're in such a transformational state, not only as individual countries, but as humanity.
[01:17:51.565 --> 01:17:54.506]  We are running out of planet and we need to start to work together.
[01:17:54.966 --> 01:17:56.286]  And I'm really encouraged.
[01:17:56.786 --> 01:18:02.708]  I'm so concerned about what is currently happening in the Gulf of Mexico and I've been reading first
[01:18:03.328 --> 01:18:03.488]  Well, I
[01:18:23.871 --> 01:18:47.920]  I mean early on I've been defending WikiLeaks and think this is important but then I get criticized so I've been trying to really gauge it and figure out what's really happening here but I do see the mainstream media putting the focus back on WikiLeaks like they're bad from one perspective and Senator Graham calling for criminal indictments and then I do see some of the alternative media raising questions so that's why we've been trying to flesh it out and have
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:49.300]  A larger discussion.
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:54.342]  I wish Julian Assange would come on this radio show and, you know, tell us directly.
[01:18:54.963 --> 01:19:00.665]  But I know he's tried to be impartial and just release the info without giving his views on it.
[01:19:01.325 --> 01:19:03.886]  But I think he has given some of his views, you know, in fairness.
[01:19:04.166 --> 01:19:08.708]  You know, saying this shows, you know, the, you know, the carnage that's involved.
[01:19:10.438 --> 01:19:17.701]  Well, it just shows the horror of war every day, day by day, and it doesn't show, like, one massive, huge killing.
[01:19:17.761 --> 01:19:24.563]  It just shows the everyday killing of citizens, and also how the war has been painted in different colors than you can actually read there.
[01:19:25.284 --> 01:19:26.164]  I think it was important.
[01:19:26.584 --> 01:19:31.066]  If this would have just been dumped on WikiLeaks without any explanation...
[01:19:32.266 --> 01:19:37.447]  And in that investigation into, for example, the military language.
[01:19:37.607 --> 01:19:39.887]  I mean, I can't understand most of this language.
[01:19:40.268 --> 01:19:43.508]  I'm not born and raised in that sort of lingo.
[01:19:43.528 --> 01:19:51.770]  So I think it is important that we, you know, that we have an access to some sort of understanding what this all means.
[01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:52.530]  Absolutely.
[01:19:52.570 --> 01:19:59.631]  Let's talk about more of what's in those documents than the Gulf of Mexico info and the latest there in Iceland and the film.
[01:20:00.151 --> 01:20:03.173]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:20:03.514 --> 01:20:07.136]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:20:07.436 --> 01:20:10.899]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:20:11.159 --> 01:20:12.720]  Add less than 2 cents per gallon.
[01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:17.824]  Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluorine,
[01:20:21.428 --> 01:20:21.908]  We're good to go.
[01:20:49.895 --> 01:20:54.876]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:20:55.056 --> 01:20:59.397]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[01:20:59.798 --> 01:21:02.518]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:21:02.758 --> 01:21:06.719]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:21:06.919 --> 01:21:08.980]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:14.201]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:21:14.341 --> 01:21:16.102]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:21:16.162 --> 01:21:17.462]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:21:17.702 --> 01:21:19.144]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:21:19.184 --> 01:21:22.288]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:21:22.568 --> 01:21:27.594]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:21:27.934 --> 01:21:37.005]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[01:21:37.005 --> 01:21:37.445]  I think so.
[01:21:59.292 --> 01:22:01.613]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:22:01.693 --> 01:22:03.874]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:22:03.894 --> 01:22:06.796]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:22:07.216 --> 01:22:11.959]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:22:12.319 --> 01:22:16.521]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:22:16.821 --> 01:22:19.165]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:22:19.185 --> 01:22:21.709]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:22:22.069 --> 01:22:24.633]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:32.585]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:22:32.905 --> 01:22:38.189]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:22:38.289 --> 01:22:41.111]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:22:41.151 --> 01:22:44.593]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:22:44.833 --> 01:22:45.754]  And I got news for you.
[01:22:45.914 --> 01:22:47.215]  You're everyone else.

[01:23:49.670 --> 01:23:50.030]  That's 800-976-0026.
[01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:51.791]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[01:24:06.417 --> 01:24:20.467]  We are back live and we do need to have the focus on the documents, the massacres, the killing, the fact that the war is a disaster, that the troops are in there being forced to grow the opium, instead of just obsessing over WikiLeaks.
[01:24:20.748 --> 01:24:26.492]  We need to look at those documents themselves and the controlled media has been pretty successful at spinning it away from that.
[01:24:26.912 --> 01:24:34.398]  Birgitta Jones-Dottier, looking over these documents, I mean, how long ago did you know about the documents before they released them?
[01:24:35.956 --> 01:24:37.357]  Ah, just a little while before.
[01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:45.145]  There is actually so much occurring in Iceland that I've had to put my focus on there in the last month or so.
[01:24:45.605 --> 01:24:54.773]  But what I've seen, and just also just from reading, I was particularly impressed with The Guardian.
[01:24:54.813 --> 01:24:58.157]  I wish I could read their speaker, which is a very reputable
[01:25:00.101 --> 01:25:02.102]  German weekly magazine.
[01:25:03.583 --> 01:25:07.004]  I was disappointed with the take of the New York Times on it.
[01:25:07.104 --> 01:25:11.466]  It was way too soft somehow and just didn't really get into the grittiness of it.
[01:25:12.966 --> 01:25:22.650]  What it shows us is that the war is actually not going as well as the mainstream media and the Obama administration has been
[01:25:23.790 --> 01:25:24.070]  I think?
[01:25:44.904 --> 01:25:55.026]  Every NATO country, for example, needs to... I do think I am a part of... I go to the NATO parliamentary meetings and ironically I'm a part of that.
[01:25:55.046 --> 01:25:59.627]  I believe we need also people that work for peace and pacifism.
[01:25:59.647 --> 01:26:04.888]  Being a member of the Icelandic Parliament and being able to go to these NATO meetings, what is the sense of Europe?
[01:26:04.928 --> 01:26:08.729]  I mean, I've read in the polls that the people do not want to be in Afghanistan.
[01:26:10.009 --> 01:26:12.210]  Yes, and you know, for example,
[01:26:14.663 --> 01:26:20.268]  I really don't think that anybody has a comprehensive understanding of the purpose of this war.
[01:26:20.288 --> 01:26:26.974]  I mean, first, many people felt it was like a revenge against the 9-11 attack in the US.
[01:26:27.795 --> 01:26:38.365]  Then they wanted to liberate the Afghanis from themselves, or the Taliban, or the opium lords, and now we get news about, and it's been known for years,
[01:26:38.965 --> 01:26:41.666]  The opium trade is so strong in Afghanistan.
[01:26:41.706 --> 01:26:42.667]  How is that possible?
[01:26:43.687 --> 01:26:53.993]  We heard also, I remember that there was very much propaganda around that NATO wanted to help Afghanistan to build schools and liberate women and so forth.
[01:26:54.313 --> 01:26:55.373]  Is that really happening?
[01:26:55.393 --> 01:27:00.896]  Is the infrastructure of Afghanistan stronger?
[01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:02.357]  I don't think so.
[01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:04.918]  So what is the purpose of this war?
[01:27:05.098 --> 01:27:06.019]  Let's talk about that.
[01:27:06.619 --> 01:27:08.480]  What is the purpose of the war in Afghanistan?
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:10.681]  From your research, what is the purpose?
[01:27:12.161 --> 01:27:14.962]  Well, it's about natural resources.
[01:27:15.242 --> 01:27:15.642]  What else?
[01:27:16.983 --> 01:27:21.344]  Yeah, it's not opium, it's about lithium, it's about oil and gas pipeline routes.
[01:27:21.665 --> 01:27:26.446]  It's also about being a strategic base to menace Russia, Pakistan and China.
[01:27:27.427 --> 01:27:36.630]  I mean, NATO means the North Atlantic Military Alliance or whatever, and it's very far from the North Atlantic.
[01:27:37.429 --> 01:27:39.493]  What is NATO doing in Afghanistan?
[01:27:43.052 --> 01:27:44.213]  Really, yeah, exactly.
[01:27:44.633 --> 01:27:56.519]  Well, I think that that is not, for example, the vision of those... Well, very many people in Iceland are not happy with Iceland being part of NATO because we want to be a pacifist nation.
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:05.324]  Birgitta, do you think that this is going to have the same effect that the Pentagon Papers did with finally starting the end of the Vietnam War?
[01:28:05.364 --> 01:28:10.007]  Do you think... I mean, because this is earth-shaking if we're able to actually get the information out of the people.
[01:28:10.905 --> 01:28:17.294]  Well, Daniel Ellsberg says that he compares this to the Pentagon Papers and he is, of course, the person responsible for that leak.
[01:28:18.375 --> 01:28:27.608]  So, you know, he is a person that I greatly respect and I encourage people to listen to what he's been saying about this leak and WikiLeaks as well.
[01:28:29.683 --> 01:28:48.153]  I hope that this will be the end of this war, but I really do also hope that the material that has been leaked on WikiLeaks and elsewhere about the reality of war, modern warfare, and the motivations behind these wars will give people enough power to at least stop the next war looming.
[01:28:48.413 --> 01:28:50.474]  We all know that they are trying to start a war,
[01:28:50.874 --> 01:28:58.737]  Well, I just hope that people realize that we're not in Afghanistan for the reasons, the different reasons we've been given in the past.
[01:28:58.757 --> 01:29:00.578]  How is the Icelandic media covering WikiLeaks?
[01:29:22.291 --> 01:29:28.092]  They're quite positive about it, except of course the predictable media.
[01:29:29.313 --> 01:29:30.193]  It's always the same.
[01:29:30.593 --> 01:29:32.393]  It's left and right gameplay.
[01:29:32.914 --> 01:29:35.594]  Birgitta, final segment with you straight ahead.
[01:29:35.834 --> 01:29:37.294]  Any subjects you want to talk about?
[01:29:37.314 --> 01:29:46.036]  The latest with your fight against the banking looting, the banking occupation forces there, and the info you wanted to get into concerning the Gulf of Mexico spill.
[01:29:46.316 --> 01:29:48.517]  We'll be right back with a member of parliament from Iceland.
[01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:53.138]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:56.766]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:58.902 --> 01:32:03.125]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:03.445 --> 01:32:03.725]  Number 1.
[01:32:04.366 --> 01:32:07.508]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:07.788 --> 01:32:08.348]  Number 2.
[01:32:08.649 --> 01:32:13.212]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:13.532 --> 01:32:13.992]  It's true.
[01:32:14.272 --> 01:32:18.835]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:19.156 --> 01:32:19.696]  Number 3.
[01:32:19.976 --> 01:32:23.278]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:23.578 --> 01:32:27.261]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:27.461 --> 01:32:28.021]  Number four.
[01:32:28.261 --> 01:32:30.622]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:31.022 --> 01:32:34.403]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:34.703 --> 01:32:35.243]  Number five.
[01:32:35.483 --> 01:32:39.404]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:39.644 --> 01:32:44.406]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:44.686 --> 01:32:48.727]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:48.867 --> 01:32:50.428]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:55.829 --> 01:33:06.034]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:06.934 --> 01:33:08.375]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:11.923 --> 01:33:12.944]  We got Ray McGovern.
[01:33:13.204 --> 01:33:15.886]  He thinks the WikiLeaks situation is huge news.
[01:33:16.486 --> 01:33:17.147]  Very important.
[01:33:17.307 --> 01:33:21.330]  He's had a chance to analyze some of the 92,000 documents.
[01:33:21.370 --> 01:33:23.332]  He'll be joining us 30 minutes to the next hour.
[01:33:23.732 --> 01:33:25.793]  And then, the father of the birther movement.
[01:33:25.813 --> 01:33:28.195]  A lot of key intel he's developed.
[01:33:28.595 --> 01:33:31.378]  Attorney Phil Berg's joining us in the last half of the next hour.
[01:33:31.738 --> 01:33:35.140]  Going back to Birgitta Jones-Dottier, I've asked her a lot of questions.
[01:33:35.741 --> 01:33:37.282]  I appreciate her joining us.
[01:33:38.763 --> 01:33:39.023]  Well, I guess...
[01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:17.936]  The best way of supporting us is just to support any attempts in your own countries to change the way we handle the monetary system.
[01:34:18.177 --> 01:34:21.078]  We need to rethink the way we do banking.
[01:34:21.238 --> 01:34:24.080]  The way I see reserve banking, it is a criminal act.
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:32.685]  And we are hoping, it looks actually quite positive, that the best bank will be established in the city of Reykjavik.
[01:34:32.805 --> 01:34:36.147]  It is being looked into now by the Reykjavik City Council.
[01:34:37.348 --> 01:34:54.640]  And there is sort of a growing understanding among people, and I'm actually attending tonight a meeting about the monetary system, and a grassroots group that has also been bringing forward this idea about the best bank, which is based on the model of North Dakota.
[01:34:56.941 --> 01:35:15.607]  You already have so many fantastic things in place in your country that would be fantastic to see if you would do this in each and every state for example to have like the Bank of North Dakota it is such an incredibly fantastic model to base you know and to have business with.
[01:35:16.127 --> 01:35:17.648]  So you know I guess
[01:35:18.348 --> 01:35:36.708]  The best support we could have right now is, like I have asked before, is if you have any information, you know, deep information about how the IMF functions, any recent good documentaries about the IMF, how they roll over nations and destroy them,
[01:35:37.428 --> 01:35:38.388]  That would be very useful.
[01:35:38.448 --> 01:35:46.130]  We're trying to form a group and we're going to have a big rally next month to raise awareness about who is really in charge in Iceland.
[01:35:46.170 --> 01:35:49.031]  And there's been actually regular protests outside their offices.
[01:35:50.831 --> 01:36:00.354]  My biggest concern right now is the IMF and their influence on our energy sector and their desire and
[01:36:01.913 --> 01:36:10.340]  Or actually their demand that we will prioritize our energy sector, which has always been publicly owned and should still be publicly owned.
[01:36:10.741 --> 01:36:19.308]  We are just, I think the biggest support is actually just growing awareness about, you know, just keep your eyes on Iceland and support the EMEA initiative.
[01:36:20.249 --> 01:36:22.410]  But, you know, I like to see it as a
[01:36:23.616 --> 01:36:31.986]  I like to see people in general just wake up and realize that they are the change, even though this is an Obama slogan.
[01:36:32.006 --> 01:36:33.368]  I think it's a good slogan.
[01:36:33.508 --> 01:36:40.756]  I think each and every one of us have to remember that we as individuals can change the world and now is really the time for that.
[01:36:41.877 --> 01:36:45.958]  In relation to the BP, I don't have a lot of insider's information.
[01:36:45.978 --> 01:36:57.621]  I just want to encourage people, if they do have information, that they feel that the general public should have access to, to just leak it.
[01:36:58.121 --> 01:36:58.642]  It's simple.
[01:36:59.662 --> 01:37:04.023]  Everybody needs to be aware of what is really going on there.
[01:37:04.103 --> 01:37:08.784]  The storm season is about to break on, isn't it, in August?
[01:37:09.004 --> 01:37:09.384]  Yes.
[01:37:09.404 --> 01:37:10.845]  The hurricanes and so forth.
[01:37:12.826 --> 01:37:32.857]  I think also it is important to encourage journalists and activists to work very thoroughly together investigating also the history of BP because I've heard that there have been similar accidents like the one in the Gulf of Mexico in South America that got very little report about.
[01:37:33.217 --> 01:37:33.857]  Well, you're right.
[01:37:33.897 --> 01:37:38.139]  BP has the worst safety record in the United States alone.
[01:37:38.639 --> 01:37:47.342]  They have had more violations and more disasters, according to the Associated Press, than all the other oil companies in the Houston area combined.
[01:37:47.362 --> 01:37:58.906]  And now their last CEO has gone to Russia, and the guy they had running Russia BP operations, he's become the new head here.
[01:37:58.966 --> 01:37:59.806]  So it's just amazing.
[01:38:01.016 --> 01:38:26.656]  Yes, and I think if we can dig enough information about them and get it into the mainstream media, I mean, I saw a video clip from CNN saying that the First Amendment was being broken on them and, you know, because they couldn't report about, for example, the people that are getting sick that are working in the cleaning effort, about all the animals, small and large, that are dying.
[01:38:27.196 --> 01:38:36.024]  And just the fact that they did this experiment with chemicals so that the oil spill is, you know, 90% underwater, so you can't see it.
[01:38:36.845 --> 01:38:45.332]  And then, you know, it's a blackout, media blackout, so the media is completely controlled, just like the war in, you know, the first Iraqi war.
[01:38:45.612 --> 01:38:52.598]  And, you know, I just encourage everybody to both pull together the information and
[01:38:54.700 --> 01:39:01.225]  Harass your local representatives so that you can actually get an understanding of what is really going on.
[01:39:03.006 --> 01:39:19.497]  And I think that in general, if we allow the big corporations to do their criminal activities unpunished and just to turn away when people are in distress, like in that entire region,
[01:39:21.358 --> 01:39:22.479]  Then we haven't learned anything.
[01:39:22.699 --> 01:39:23.299]  Then they're winning.
[01:39:23.639 --> 01:39:24.160]  Well, you're right.
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:28.262]  I mean, then it allows them to set the precedent to get away with anything they want.
[01:39:28.862 --> 01:39:35.326]  Birgitta Jones-Dottir, a member of the Icelandic Parliament, really leading the opposition against the banking takeover and having a lot of success.
[01:39:35.666 --> 01:39:38.268]  We salute your great work and God bless you.
[01:39:38.388 --> 01:39:42.990]  And if more people had the same spirit of liberty that you have, we wouldn't be in such bad shape.
[01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:47.313]  So I hope that your spirit of freedom does infect others.
[01:39:47.893 --> 01:39:51.955]  And of course, much of what she's talking about is in the film, The Secret of Oz.
[01:39:52.355 --> 01:39:55.677]  I would add it's available at Infowars.com.
[01:39:56.137 --> 01:39:58.458]  Birgitta, thank you for joining us on short notice.
[01:39:58.498 --> 01:40:01.520]  What's the best website for people to visit to find out more about your work?
[01:40:04.158 --> 01:40:06.439]  It's probably just best to get onto Facebook.
[01:40:06.519 --> 01:40:15.623]  I have a fan page there, where I'm actually quite active there, to both put in the newest links and films and so forth.
[01:40:15.963 --> 01:40:21.465]  And I really strongly want to urge people to see a very, very important film called Flow, for the love of water.
[01:40:21.505 --> 01:40:23.926]  You can see that for free on the internet.
[01:40:24.006 --> 01:40:25.866]  It is about the privatization of water.
[01:40:25.886 --> 01:40:30.008]  And I strongly urge everybody to see that particular film.
[01:40:31.809 --> 01:40:37.076]  And I urge people to be in touch either via Facebook or you go to my personal website.
[01:40:37.396 --> 01:40:39.178]  If you Google my name, you can find that.
[01:40:39.198 --> 01:40:40.740]  This should pop up first.
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:41.541]  All right.
[01:40:41.621 --> 01:40:44.004]  All right, Birgitta Jones-Dottier.
[01:40:44.745 --> 01:40:45.306]  God bless you.
[01:40:45.326 --> 01:40:46.307]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:40:46.327 --> 01:40:46.748]  Keep it up.
[01:40:47.850 --> 01:40:48.270]  You too.
[01:40:48.691 --> 01:40:52.454]  All right, there goes, thank you, there goes Birgitta Jones-Dottier.
[01:40:53.054 --> 01:40:59.660]  And by the way, the maker of this film, director Bill Still, who made The Money Masters, went to Iceland.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:00.521]  That's in his film.
[01:41:01.101 --> 01:41:10.970]  It's got Ellen Brown, Byron Dale, Joseph Farah, Professor Michael Hudson, James Robertson, Peter Shipp, Professor Quentin Taylor, and many others.
[01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:13.051]  It is available at Infowars.com.
[01:41:13.772 --> 01:41:18.815]  Discounted, it exposes the banking cartel and solutions of how to stop these people.
[01:41:19.896 --> 01:41:22.337]  Now, I want to shift gears.
[01:41:23.338 --> 01:41:38.747]  I talked in the first hour a lot about Google and a report out of Wired Magazine today, their online version, exclusive Google CIA invest in future of web monitoring.
[01:41:39.793 --> 01:41:49.880]  And it says an investment arm of the CIA and Google are both backing a company that monitors the web in real time and says it uses the information to predict the future.
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:52.842]  Predict the future.
[01:41:53.302 --> 01:41:54.163]  You heard me right.
[01:41:54.563 --> 01:42:01.368]  Tracking everything you do in real time, your cell phones, your smart meters, watching what you're doing in your house.
[01:42:01.688 --> 01:42:03.550]  They're coming out with new appliances that
[01:42:04.410 --> 01:42:23.285]  The company's called Recorded Future and it scours tens of thousands of websites, blogs, and Twitter accounts to find the relationship between people, organizations, actions, and incidents, both present and still to come.
[01:42:23.585 --> 01:42:24.306]  So it's pre-crime.
[01:42:25.186 --> 01:42:33.433]  In a white paper, the company says its temporal analysis engine goes beyond search by looking at the invisible links between documents
[01:42:34.502 --> 01:43:01.731]  that talk about the same or related issues so it's relationships entities and events and it goes into house being funded by google and the cia and is run by a former swedish army ranger with a phd in computer science and it goes into the sixteen-person cambridge massachusetts firm attractive to google ventures and in q tell a branch of the cia now i made the point that their this
[01:43:02.799 --> 01:43:07.182]  Doesn't point out that the government admits they post fake Al-Qaeda blogs everywhere to scare the public.
[01:43:07.863 --> 01:43:14.428]  Even the CIA admitted in the Washington Post two months ago they've created fake Al-Qaeda videos with Bin Laden and others.
[01:43:14.468 --> 01:43:15.088]  This is admitted.
[01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:31.841]  And so they're tracking all this fake info that private corporations and intelligence agencies and government and outside of government are posting to create this fake illusion of men with turbans hiding underneath your table trying to suck the blood out of your feet.
[01:43:32.952 --> 01:43:34.894]  Or hiding in your closet or under your bed.
[01:43:35.814 --> 01:43:46.463]  And the fact that they do put out fake info constantly and that they can also then come to you with pre-crime and say that they've got evidence you've committed a crime and they talk about that in here.
[01:43:47.083 --> 01:43:50.646]  We already proved lie detectors were used to put hundreds of thousands of innocent people in prison.
[01:43:51.187 --> 01:43:54.770]  The governments have been caught all over the place planting fake DNA evidence on people.
[01:43:55.290 --> 01:43:55.831]  They can fake
[01:43:56.511 --> 01:43:57.131]  Fingerprints.
[01:43:57.711 --> 01:43:59.172]  I mean, all of this is admitted.
[01:43:59.892 --> 01:44:07.995]  And so you can't trust the big corrupt system to be doing this, but now they admit that all of this surveillance is really going on and happening.
[01:44:08.035 --> 01:44:09.815]  This is so important.
[01:44:09.855 --> 01:44:14.237]  Now, I just wanted to recap that because it dovetails with this.
[01:44:14.877 --> 01:44:16.657]  This is the Washington Post today.
[01:44:16.977 --> 01:44:21.059]  White House proposal would ease FBI access to records of Internet activity.
[01:44:21.319 --> 01:44:24.700]  But you read the full proposal, it's also them getting into your computer
[01:44:26.121 --> 01:44:30.205]  With remote access, basically expanding the sneak-and-peek provision with no warrants.
[01:44:30.225 --> 01:44:38.232]  The Obama administration is seeking to make it easier for the FBI to compel companies to turn over records of an individual's internet activity without a court order.
[01:44:38.453 --> 01:44:39.293]  It's without a warrant.
[01:44:39.594 --> 01:44:43.197]  If agents deem the information is relevant to terrorism or...
[01:44:44.458 --> 01:44:45.980]  An intelligence investigation.
[01:44:46.741 --> 01:44:48.343]  What does the Enemy Combatant Act say?
[01:44:48.443 --> 01:44:50.485]  What does the Violent Belligerent Act say?
[01:44:50.865 --> 01:44:53.549]  What does the Patriot Act say for any misdemeanor crime?
[01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:57.073]  It says they can secretly arrest you for any intelligence purposes.
[01:44:57.813 --> 01:44:58.334]  All of this.
[01:44:59.275 --> 01:45:00.676]  So this is pointed at you.
[01:45:00.756 --> 01:45:11.221]  We know almost 100% of the Homeland Security apparatus, with 854,000 private spies, secretly federalizing police chiefs, all of this is now coming out.
[01:45:11.681 --> 01:45:24.968]  We know it's pointed at gun owners, conservatives, landowners, businesses that aren't part of the New World Order, so global businesses can consolidate control and have espionage, private intel on you.
[01:45:25.908 --> 01:45:40.103]  I read Bloomberg with their big report, Fallen Soldiers Families Denied Cash As Insurers Profit, and it admits that the reports here say that every major insurance company is involved in this.
[01:45:42.398 --> 01:45:44.338]  And it goes on to say, this is bad faith.
[01:45:44.378 --> 01:45:45.119]  This is criminal.
[01:45:45.199 --> 01:45:46.879]  It's institutionalized bad faith.
[01:45:46.919 --> 01:45:54.621]  In my view, this is a scheme to defraud by inducing the policyholder's beneficiary to let the life insurance company retain assets they're not entitled to.
[01:45:54.901 --> 01:45:56.841]  It's turning death claims into a profit center.
[01:45:57.381 --> 01:46:03.923]  And they just mail you something saying, here's your checkbook to draw your dead husband or dead son's insurance money.
[01:46:04.263 --> 01:46:05.163]  And when you sign it,
[01:46:06.513 --> 01:46:15.439]  Then they take $400,000, $500,000, $1,000,000 from you and give you 1% interest a year on it, but never give you the full money.
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:21.183]  And it goes on in the article talking about how it's criminal, but they got the feds to change the regulations so they could do this.
[01:46:21.684 --> 01:46:22.725]  And it goes further than that.
[01:46:23.905 --> 01:46:26.888]  Big corporations hire greeters at their front doors.
[01:46:27.668 --> 01:46:35.613]  And then they've been caught taking insurance out on them and never even telling the family and keeping it, and they've done actuaries knowing a certain amount are going to die, they're going to get that money.
[01:46:36.073 --> 01:46:39.975]  This is just an example of how criminal these systems are.
[01:46:40.015 --> 01:46:46.799]  Now I want to shift gears and dovetail again all of this information that we're going to be covering here.
[01:46:52.506 --> 01:47:11.539]  This caller today called in to the Todd and Don Show that's on News Radio 590 KLBJ in the morning, and I was driving into work and heard this, and I've heard similar things over and over and over again, and it mirrors what the woman said in Terror Storm in London, where she said, I want to give up my liberty for freedom.
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:17.823]  And they say, well, if you don't have anything to hide, let the government spy on you.
[01:47:17.863 --> 01:47:20.025]  Well, why do we have... without warrants?
[01:47:20.385 --> 01:47:21.206]  Why do we even have
[01:47:22.105 --> 01:47:24.748]  A Magna Carta, a Bill of Rights, a Constitution.
[01:47:25.108 --> 01:47:27.090]  Why do we even have due process?
[01:47:27.130 --> 01:47:28.271]  Why do we even have property rights?
[01:47:28.491 --> 01:47:29.572]  Why do we have a Fourth Amendment?
[01:47:29.872 --> 01:47:31.374]  Why do we have any of this?
[01:47:31.434 --> 01:47:33.336]  It's to protect us from a criminal government.
[01:47:33.756 --> 01:47:40.763]  The government now wants to be able to secretly arrest you for no reason and have the military literally take you to a FEMA camp.
[01:47:40.803 --> 01:47:42.284]  That's in the Violent Belligerence Act.
[01:47:42.464 --> 01:47:45.087]  But it says, not for violence, for any reason they deem.
[01:47:45.347 --> 01:47:45.988]  And it's secret.
[01:47:47.639 --> 01:47:54.587]  The great danger, as Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Thomas Paine explained to us, was corrupt government.
[01:47:55.188 --> 01:48:03.197]  So here's this woman, Connie, calling in, saying, I believe the FBI should be able to just do whatever they want and not have warrants.
[01:48:03.237 --> 01:48:04.839]  The Constitution's bad.
[01:48:04.859 --> 01:48:07.261]  We need to get rid of it to keep us safe.
[01:48:08.137 --> 01:48:13.281]  She doesn't understand our government's now run by a bunch of crooks, and that's why the founders put the Bill of Rights there.
[01:48:13.541 --> 01:48:15.743]  If she doesn't like that, she should leave America.
[01:48:16.403 --> 01:48:19.345]  Because it's America that was so special.
[01:48:19.385 --> 01:48:21.207]  We were just more real estate, more dirt.
[01:48:21.467 --> 01:48:26.571]  But we had a freer system that empowered the individual, that empowered liberty.
[01:48:27.534 --> 01:48:28.834]  So let's go ahead and start this clip.
[01:48:28.854 --> 01:48:29.255]  Here it is.
[01:48:29.615 --> 01:48:31.515]  You don't want the FBI to search your computer?
[01:48:31.875 --> 01:48:32.656]  No, I really don't.
[01:48:32.796 --> 01:48:33.056]  Okay.
[01:48:33.216 --> 01:48:33.816]  I really don't.
[01:48:34.256 --> 01:48:35.436]  Connie, you're on KLBJ.
[01:48:35.456 --> 01:48:35.837]  Good morning.
[01:48:35.877 --> 01:48:36.917]  Especially since I... Good morning.
[01:48:37.317 --> 01:48:38.257]  ...remembered a couple things.
[01:48:38.297 --> 01:48:38.437]  Yeah.
[01:48:38.957 --> 01:48:39.358]  Good morning.
[01:48:39.398 --> 01:48:39.498]  Hello?
[01:48:39.758 --> 01:48:40.038]  Yes.
[01:48:41.678 --> 01:48:49.681]  I just was making a comment on the FBI being able to come and get your computer and go through it if they think, you know, there's something wrong.
[01:48:50.941 --> 01:48:55.642]  If you have nothing to hide, you should be glad they're doing that because they're trying to protect you.
[01:48:56.243 --> 01:48:56.643]  And I...
[01:48:57.839 --> 01:49:04.623]  I think we use the Constitution and whatever just to help the terrorists and that's stupid.
[01:49:04.723 --> 01:49:11.728]  We should be helping America and let them come in and let them do what they need to do to catch these terrorists.
[01:49:11.868 --> 01:49:13.189]  So sacrifice your freedom.
[01:49:13.929 --> 01:49:18.412]  Alright, we're going to come back from break and play the whole clip unedited, but I just want to point out
[01:49:19.662 --> 01:49:20.963]  Again, this is America.
[01:49:21.003 --> 01:49:22.624]  We have a Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:49:23.064 --> 01:49:24.305]  We elect judges.
[01:49:24.525 --> 01:49:25.766]  We elect sheriffs.
[01:49:26.087 --> 01:49:32.231]  We elect city councils and county commissioners and statehouse legislators and congressmen and women, senators.
[01:49:33.666 --> 01:49:36.707]  That's why the police can't become their own power.
[01:49:36.948 --> 01:49:40.409]  That's what's happened to every third world country and Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.
[01:49:40.669 --> 01:49:46.732]  They do become their own power and then they rob and loot and take over the society for the special interests they serve.
[01:49:47.052 --> 01:49:55.576]  You've got to go to a judge under those rules and show your evidence or your probable cause that there's something going on.
[01:49:57.017 --> 01:50:01.659]  Meanwhile the entire Bill of Rights is being removed for the American people and then something that is constitutional
[01:50:02.762 --> 01:50:08.744]  The Arizona law, after somebody's already been stopped for speeding or drunk driving, to say, okay, are you a citizen?
[01:50:10.344 --> 01:50:11.484]  Every other country does that.
[01:50:12.385 --> 01:50:16.766]  But we can't do things that are constitutional, but they do everything else that isn't.
[01:50:17.366 --> 01:50:27.489]  And this woman thinks that she's going to be safe if the FBI and these hundreds of thousands, well now in the millions, of secret spies have unlimited power.
[01:50:28.413 --> 01:50:33.457]  She is totally ignorant and just thinks the government is their big daddy, their big nanny state that cares about you.
[01:50:33.777 --> 01:50:36.519]  Lady, they've passed laws to be able to take your pension funds.
[01:50:36.579 --> 01:50:37.340]  It's already started.
[01:50:38.361 --> 01:50:43.785]  They've passed laws to make it legal for them to take your insurance money and not pay you.
[01:50:44.005 --> 01:50:48.609]  They're passing laws to double, triple your water bill, to put toll roads on existing roads.
[01:50:49.554 --> 01:50:52.121]  They're passing laws to legalize criminality.
[01:50:52.301 --> 01:50:53.504]  That's what Nazi Germany did.
[01:50:53.825 --> 01:50:55.950]  The government is the number one killer in history.
[01:50:56.191 --> 01:50:58.376]  You better figure that out, you dingbat!
[01:50:59.977 --> 01:51:07.961]  Gulf War vets, 9-11 workers, people around the Gulf oil spill fumes, all were exposed to toxic chemicals in the air and became ill.
[01:51:08.181 --> 01:51:10.662]  Even in your home, air contamination can make you sick.
[01:51:10.842 --> 01:51:18.126]  You have been exposed to airborne toxic particulate matter and volatile organic compounds causing fatigue, flu-like symptoms, or worse.
[01:51:18.286 --> 01:51:19.046]  Protect yourself.
[01:51:19.286 --> 01:51:21.387]  You cannot trust anyone to do it for you.
[01:51:21.587 --> 01:51:25.429]  Clean the air in your home or workplace with a Health Mate Plus air purifier.
[01:51:25.609 --> 01:51:29.930]  Call airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to purify the air you breathe.

[01:51:59.999 --> 01:52:01.259]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.299 --> 01:52:06.641]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:06.882 --> 01:52:11.503]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:11.904 --> 01:52:16.946]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:17.466 --> 01:52:22.169]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:22.690 --> 01:52:24.611]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:25.011 --> 01:52:29.614]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:29.814 --> 01:52:30.715]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:30.935 --> 01:52:33.697]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:33.997 --> 01:52:37.299]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:40.461]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:40.822 --> 01:52:42.703]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:43.043 --> 01:52:43.964]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:47.686 --> 01:52:51.308]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:51.829 --> 01:52:56.331]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:56.651 --> 01:52:59.033]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:59.963 --> 01:53:02.885]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:53:02.965 --> 01:53:04.926]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:53:05.046 --> 01:53:07.708]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:53:07.788 --> 01:53:09.749]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:53:10.009 --> 01:53:11.210]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:13.031]  But first, the facts.
[01:53:13.332 --> 01:53:15.053]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:53:15.253 --> 01:53:16.974]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:53:17.254 --> 01:53:20.736]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:53:20.937 --> 01:53:28.321]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.

[01:53:50.879 --> 01:53:51.279]  It works!
[01:54:06.571 --> 01:54:10.694]  So you don't want the FBI to search your computer?
[01:54:11.074 --> 01:54:11.835]  No, I really don't.
[01:54:12.395 --> 01:54:12.995]  I really don't.
[01:54:13.436 --> 01:54:14.636]  Connie, you're on KLBJ.
[01:54:14.656 --> 01:54:15.017]  Good morning.
[01:54:15.437 --> 01:54:16.097]  Good morning.
[01:54:16.658 --> 01:54:28.865]  I just was making a comment on the FBI being able to come and get your computer and go through it if they think there's something wrong.
[01:54:30.126 --> 01:54:34.789]  If you have nothing to hide, you should be glad they're doing that because they're trying to protect you.
[01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:43.795]  And I think we use the Constitution and whatever just to help the terrorists and that's stupid.
[01:54:43.915 --> 01:54:50.940]  We should be helping America and let them come in and let them do what they need to do to catch these terrorists.
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:52.521]  So sacrifice your freedoms?
[01:54:53.399 --> 01:54:55.380]  It's not a... It's a freedom.
[01:54:55.681 --> 01:54:58.383]  Would you rather be killed by the terrorists?
[01:54:58.723 --> 01:55:00.224]  I mean, it's serious.
[01:55:00.424 --> 01:55:02.666]  Well, that's how I feel about airport security any time.
[01:55:02.686 --> 01:55:06.469]  Go ahead and finish your question.
[01:55:07.289 --> 01:55:09.491]  It wasn't a question, it was a comment.
[01:55:09.751 --> 01:55:13.614]  Would somebody rather be killed by a terrorist than sacrifice their freedoms?
[01:55:14.414 --> 01:55:14.715]  Right.
[01:55:16.716 --> 01:55:18.777]  I'd like to hear you throw that question at a few soldiers.
[01:55:21.554 --> 01:55:25.316]  I think that the soldiers are fighting at a deficit.
[01:55:25.596 --> 01:55:37.542]  In other words, we have all these little laws that are helping the terrorists and we need to make it so that they're safer and let the government go and check all these bad people.
[01:55:37.642 --> 01:55:38.303]  Good grief!
[01:55:38.963 --> 01:55:40.384]  You know, it's people that are so
[01:55:41.645 --> 01:55:43.266]  I don't agree with her at all.
[01:55:43.286 --> 01:55:45.907]  I mean how could you agree with her?
[01:56:01.618 --> 01:56:11.202]  I mean, I guess the Founding Fathers are idiots, and Connie, who can barely talk, she's an expert, but she represents that 30% or so in the polls who like the naked body scanners.
[01:56:12.803 --> 01:56:17.224]  And the government lies and says, we're not recording it, we can't see your genitals, and now they admit they are recording it.
[01:56:17.825 --> 01:56:19.365]  They are seeing your genitals.
[01:56:19.525 --> 01:56:25.988]  It is a body scan for passive cameras to be used on the streets to look through your clothes and know your identity.
[01:56:28.379 --> 01:56:30.440]  I mean, you know, just let them secretly arrest us.
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:33.140]  Let them round up and put a bag over the head of whoever they want.
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:36.561]  And she thinks the terrorists are these men in caves.
[01:56:37.201 --> 01:56:43.783]  But if you read all the government documents, Connie, the terrorists are listed as the American people.
[01:56:44.703 --> 01:56:46.463]  The terrorists are us.
[01:56:48.104 --> 01:56:49.124]  The terrorists are us.
[01:56:51.138 --> 01:56:55.559]  This entire system is designed to oppress the American people.
[01:56:55.599 --> 01:56:57.340]  You say, protect America.
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:00.500]  Connie, have you noticed who's looting the country?
[01:57:01.121 --> 01:57:03.681]  Have you noticed who's taking all of our liberties and freedoms, Connie?
[01:57:04.261 --> 01:57:07.522]  Have you noticed who's looting trillions of dollars?
[01:57:08.742 --> 01:57:14.424]  Have you noticed all the oppression that's happening and all the new taxes and how taxes go up but government services go down?
[01:57:16.308 --> 01:57:20.531]  I mean, Connie, they told us NAFTA and GATT was going to be great, but their plan was to deindustrialize us.
[01:57:21.111 --> 01:57:23.012]  A post-industrial society, that's stated.
[01:57:23.493 --> 01:57:28.416]  Hey, Connie, do you really believe they want to save you by taxing carbon dioxide that you exhale?
[01:57:28.636 --> 01:57:30.417]  Or do you think the big banks want to rape you?
[01:57:30.998 --> 01:57:31.658]  Financially?
[01:57:32.279 --> 01:57:35.341]  I mean, what does it take, Connie, for you to stop being such a sheeple?
[01:57:35.681 --> 01:57:40.384]  For you to stop being somebody who is so incredibly trusting of the system?
[01:57:40.744 --> 01:57:42.525]  What is your problem, Connie?
[01:57:43.766 --> 01:57:46.068]  Sometimes it just gives me a headache.
[01:57:48.237 --> 01:58:01.080]  It actually gives me a headache to listen to someone like her who just is ready to give up all of the freedoms that our forefathers fought and died for that made this country so special, that made this nation so wonderful.
[01:58:01.421 --> 01:58:03.281]  And it's all being dismantled.
[01:58:03.601 --> 01:58:07.222]  Our country is being converted 100% to the greatest tyranny ever seen on the globe.
[01:58:12.554 --> 01:58:19.400]  And there are so many weak-minded, wanting, sheeple-like people that really think the nanny state cares.
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:23.523]  Lady, why don't you read online?
[01:58:23.563 --> 01:58:24.504]  It's free online.
[01:58:24.644 --> 01:58:26.266]  Just search eco-science.
[01:58:26.286 --> 01:58:27.166]  You can find it online.
[01:58:27.807 --> 01:58:33.052]  Search full text of eco-science and read how they put stuff in your water to sterilize your fat hind end.
[01:58:33.572 --> 01:58:39.177]  Why don't you grow up and research that governments killed 200 million people last century alone?
[01:58:42.219 --> 01:58:44.324]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.647 --> 01:58:47.892]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:49.571 --> 01:58:53.533]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:58:53.773 --> 01:58:59.816]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:59:00.177 --> 01:59:07.280]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:12.123]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:59:21.114 --> 01:59:24.839]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:59:25.359 --> 01:59:31.541]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:59:32.121 --> 01:59:35.542]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:59:36.022 --> 01:59:43.344]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:59:43.444 --> 01:59:43.904]  Thank you.
[01:59:52.583 --> 01:59:54.504]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.984 --> 01:59:57.846]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.489 --> 02:00:05.150]  Big Brother.
[02:00:05.790 --> 02:00:06.851]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.551 --> 02:00:08.691]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.312 --> 02:00:10.132]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.913 --> 02:00:12.393]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.453 --> 02:00:16.115]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.636 --> 02:00:20.698]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.565 --> 02:00:27.769]  We are now into our number three, Ray McGovern.
[02:00:27.789 --> 02:00:33.695]  He was one of the chief morning briefers and analysts, of course, in George Herbert Walker Bush's administration.
[02:00:34.836 --> 02:00:36.498]  Also a Army veteran.
[02:00:36.979 --> 02:00:38.560]  He is our guest.
[02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:39.521]  I wanted to get him on.
[02:00:40.242 --> 02:00:44.045]  To talk about WikiLeaks, because I've seen him saying, look, this is a big deal.
[02:00:44.405 --> 02:00:47.147]  The media is spinning it off into, you know, why do WikiLeaks do this?
[02:00:47.167 --> 02:00:47.987]  Should they get in trouble?
[02:00:48.388 --> 02:00:57.474]  Instead of looking at what's in these documents and how Afghanistan is unwinnable, at least from the public perspective of what the system claims the war is for.
[02:00:57.494 --> 02:00:59.916]  And then we're going to get into Iran.
[02:01:00.756 --> 02:01:06.141]  More and more, it looks like they're green lighting an attack sometime as an October surprise.
[02:01:06.421 --> 02:01:08.283]  We'll talk to Ray McGovern about that as well.
[02:01:08.643 --> 02:01:09.784]  Ray, it's always great to have you.
[02:01:09.804 --> 02:01:10.445]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:01:10.465 --> 02:01:11.386]  You're most welcome.
[02:01:12.106 --> 02:01:13.628]  WikiLeaks, give us your breakdown on it.
[02:01:14.830 --> 02:01:17.332]  Well, there are a lot of interesting things about it.
[02:01:17.993 --> 02:01:30.863]  Substantively, it shows that the war is clearly a misbegotten effort, largely because Pakistan, their security services, the ISI, are supporting the Taliban.
[02:01:31.684 --> 02:01:34.446]  Funding them, training them, leading them in battle.
[02:01:34.666 --> 02:01:36.027]  It's quite remarkable.
[02:01:38.496 --> 02:01:45.298]  Army documents, you know, these are official documents recognized as authentic by the administration now.
[02:01:45.978 --> 02:02:02.042]  They paint a picture of the Inter-Service Intelligence Unit there in Pakistan taking the billion of dollars that we give them every year and turn it around and making sure that the insurgency
[02:02:04.281 --> 02:02:05.201]  Prosperous, really.
[02:02:06.122 --> 02:02:15.084]  And so, you know, this whole business about the, you know, the border areas and we need to get the Pakistanis to realize that they need to throw their lot in with us.
[02:02:15.804 --> 02:02:26.187]  Well, what really strikes me as bizarre is that you get people like our Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, goes down to Islamabad and says,
[02:02:27.754 --> 02:02:32.039]  To the Pakistani leader, she said, you really shouldn't be afraid of India.
[02:02:32.359 --> 02:02:33.520]  I just came from India.
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:35.182]  They're very nice people there.
[02:02:35.242 --> 02:02:38.205]  And they told me they wish you no harm.
[02:02:38.405 --> 02:02:40.628]  And so don't be worried about India.
[02:02:40.928 --> 02:02:42.710]  Be worried about terrorists.
[02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:45.753]  Be worried about Taliban and al-Qaeda.
[02:02:45.813 --> 02:02:47.215]  That's what you should worry about.
[02:02:48.642 --> 02:02:58.848]  Alex, anybody who knows anything about the history of the subcontinent knows that you're not going to be able to persuade the Pakistanis to worry about anybody else but India and vice versa.
[02:02:59.408 --> 02:03:01.790]  And so how does this impact on Afghanistan?
[02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:11.256]  Well, the way that the Pakistanis ensure, or try to ensure, that India no longer has a preeminent influence in
[02:03:11.716 --> 02:03:37.158]  Couple and the rest of Afghanistan is to have their own assets and those assets are ones that they recreated on our behalf many years ago They call the Taliban and they're going to play that card forever and it's just a matter of time before Before the the feckless counterinsurgency tactics realize that there's an external supply of people and weapons and everything else just as there was in Vietnam by the way and
[02:03:37.768 --> 02:03:44.270]  You know, when the North kept supplying the troops in the South, we were going to interdict the supply, right?
[02:03:44.590 --> 02:03:46.111]  And we couldn't do that, then what do we do?
[02:03:46.511 --> 02:03:47.652]  We bomb the North.
[02:03:48.152 --> 02:03:49.492]  So, what do we do in Pakistan?
[02:03:50.112 --> 02:03:55.994]  We're bombing Pakistan, this time with fancy, fancy drone stuff where nobody gets shot down or gets killed.
[02:03:56.435 --> 02:03:57.215]  Give me a break!
[02:03:57.635 --> 02:04:03.417]  It's the most feckless exercise that I've ever seen, and these documents prove it beyond reasonable belief.
[02:04:04.117 --> 02:04:05.438]  Now, beyond
[02:04:06.716 --> 02:04:08.262]  Beyond reasonable doubt, let's say.
[02:04:08.323 --> 02:04:10.973]  Now, uh, the, uh, the White House...
[02:04:11.624 --> 02:04:31.133]  Three days ago, dictated to the stenographers, they call themselves the White House Press Corps, and they all took the dictation, namely, nothing new here, you know, we do all that stuff, we took that into account when we made our big decision late last year, and all this stuff, and so that goes up in the headlines in the Washington Post and the other papers.
[02:04:31.853 --> 02:04:32.674]  It's ridiculous.
[02:04:33.554 --> 02:04:37.436]  They should read the documents, but they're being discouraged to do that.
[02:04:38.076 --> 02:04:39.116]  You know what it reminds me of?
[02:04:39.136 --> 02:04:45.738]  It reminds me of back in 2005 when the Downing Street Memo was released.
[02:04:45.758 --> 02:04:48.138]  Does that sound like we have to break here?
[02:04:49.238 --> 02:04:50.859]  If we do... Yes sir, stay there.
[02:04:50.899 --> 02:04:52.039]  We're going to come right back.
[02:04:52.059 --> 02:04:59.640]  I just didn't want to interrupt you to continue with your view of WikiLeaks, how the media is trying to spin it, what you think these documents are really going to do.

[02:05:59.525 --> 02:06:02.046]  Thousands of Americans are facing evacuation.
[02:06:02.346 --> 02:06:07.349]  If you or any of your loved ones might need to evacuate, you must do it yourselves.
[02:06:07.649 --> 02:06:10.210]  Please don't procrastinate until they do it for you.

[02:06:32.824 --> 02:06:37.067]  Evacuations are looming with the storms and the Gulf oil catastrophe.
[02:06:37.227 --> 02:06:42.272]  No matter where you live, wildfires, earthquakes, floods, and storms must be escaped.
[02:06:42.572 --> 02:06:46.115]  Don't be like a deer frozen in the headlights of oncoming disaster.

[02:06:58.991 --> 02:07:03.854]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:07:03.974 --> 02:07:04.735]  What have we got?
[02:07:04.955 --> 02:07:07.076]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:07:07.416 --> 02:07:08.137]  A republic.
[02:07:08.417 --> 02:07:10.998]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:07:11.058 --> 02:07:12.980]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:15.221]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:07:15.341 --> 02:07:16.622]  So they think they own our land?
[02:07:17.042 --> 02:07:18.163]  They think they own our water?
[02:07:18.343 --> 02:07:18.743]  Children?
[02:07:18.963 --> 02:07:19.744]  Our education?
[02:07:20.084 --> 02:07:20.684]  Our money?
[02:07:20.905 --> 02:07:24.567]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:07:24.927 --> 02:07:28.573]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:07:28.593 --> 02:07:29.574]  You are being warned.
[02:07:29.895 --> 02:07:30.716]  We have the facts.
[02:07:30.916 --> 02:07:32.038]  We have the Constitution.
[02:07:32.078 --> 02:07:32.959]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:07:32.999 --> 02:07:33.820]  We have common law.
[02:07:33.881 --> 02:07:36.124]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:36.404 --> 02:07:39.108]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[02:07:39.349 --> 02:07:40.190]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:45.076]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:07:45.236 --> 02:07:46.618]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:07:46.738 --> 02:07:47.579]  Don't tread on me.
[02:07:47.819 --> 02:07:54.687]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:08:06.027 --> 02:08:16.911]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[02:08:21.133 --> 02:08:23.854]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:27.795 --> 02:08:32.737]  All right, former CIA analyst and morning briefer to George Herbert Walker Bush and others,
[02:08:34.589 --> 02:08:39.591]  A guy who's really made a lot of accurate predictions and breakdowns here on this show joins us.
[02:08:39.611 --> 02:08:43.432]  We were talking about WikiLeaks and what that means to the Afghan war.
[02:08:43.452 --> 02:08:51.315]  In the last year, I've seen all these denials that, oh, there's not advisors, there's not army and CIA advisors in Pakistan.
[02:08:51.335 --> 02:08:52.895]  You know, that's a lie.
[02:08:53.095 --> 02:08:54.356]  There's no Blackwater there.
[02:08:55.076 --> 02:08:56.536]  Now these documents confirm that.
[02:08:56.576 --> 02:08:57.637]  But just in the last week,
[02:08:58.666 --> 02:09:04.793]  I guess ahead of these, they came out and admitted, okay, days before this came out, we do have advisors in Pakistan.
[02:09:05.334 --> 02:09:13.242]  And it does seem the way they spun this is to point it at Hamid Gul, the former head of Pakistani intelligence, and say, see, we kind of need to be there.
[02:09:13.823 --> 02:09:23.414]  But I don't think that's the fault of WikiLeaks, so much of the media just spinning it, but I know Ray McGovern can comment on that, and are there big connections from Pakistani intelligence to the Taliban, and why?
[02:09:23.835 --> 02:09:31.664]  And then I want to get into Iran, and the war drums really getting more and more intense on that front, but you were cut off by the break, Ray.
[02:09:31.684 --> 02:09:32.245]  Please continue.
[02:09:33.134 --> 02:09:49.729]  Sure, I was just trying to raise a comparison here between the WikiLeaks treatment by the fawning corporate media and the way the same fawning corporate media treated the revelations in the after Downing Street minutes.
[02:09:50.801 --> 02:10:14.572]  You'll recall that those were minutes recording the chief British spy telling Tony Blair that George Bush had decided to go to war with Iraq for regime change, that this war would be, quote, justified, end quote, by the conjunction of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism, translation from the British,
[02:10:15.533 --> 02:10:21.498]  We'll say that he has all kinds of weapons of mass destruction and that he's going to use them, give them to terrorists.
[02:10:22.059 --> 02:10:31.868]  And finally, that crowning sentence for us intelligence specialists, it went this way, quote, but the intelligence and facts are being fixed around the policy, period, end quote.
[02:10:32.408 --> 02:10:42.879]  So that was manifest information, documentary information, the minutes of the meeting written by a participant the same day, and it showed that the intelligence was being fixed.
[02:10:42.919 --> 02:10:48.605]  And that was July, the middle of July 2002, some eight or nine months before the war.
[02:10:49.265 --> 02:11:13.338]  Now, in this case, well, in that case, the New York Times avoided even mentioning it until Representative Conyers held that hearing at which I testified, and two mornings before the hearing, he and I were both on Amy Goodman, and that very morning, the Washington Post published editorial saying, oh yes, and there are these after Downing Street minutes,
[02:11:14.398 --> 02:11:16.359]  They are of no consequence.
[02:11:16.719 --> 02:11:18.000]  We knew that all the time.
[02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:28.725]  They had a laugh because my thought was, you know, if the Washington Post knew the intelligence was being fixed all the time, I don't know exactly why they didn't tell us.
[02:11:28.965 --> 02:11:32.207]  Can you hazard a guess on that, Alex?
[02:11:34.008 --> 02:11:36.129]  So the situation here is the same.
[02:11:36.169 --> 02:11:37.469]  They don't want anybody to read them.
[02:11:37.509 --> 02:11:39.150]  They don't want anybody to analyze them.
[02:11:39.590 --> 02:11:40.951]  And even the New York Times.
[02:11:42.055 --> 02:11:58.252]  Which was forced to publish this because they knew that the Guardian in London and Der Spiegel in Hamburg, that they both had them and they would be scooped and it would be very embarrassing for people to realize that the New York Times had these documents and hadn't published them.
[02:11:58.792 --> 02:11:59.472]  So what did they do?
[02:11:59.512 --> 02:12:02.533]  They went to the White House and said, you know, we're in this bind.
[02:12:02.893 --> 02:12:05.694]  We don't want to be scooped, and is it okay if we can?
[02:12:05.734 --> 02:12:09.195]  And the White House was very understanding.
[02:12:09.235 --> 02:12:11.676]  They said, oh, shucks, I guess this time you can.
[02:12:12.236 --> 02:12:19.458]  And Robert Gibbs, the president's spokesman, later complimented the responsible way the New York Times conducted themselves.
[02:12:19.998 --> 02:12:32.603]  I'll tell you, Alex, if the press has to go to the White House to receive permission to publish things, and that's the responsible way to act, we've come one heck of a long way in the free press of this country.
[02:12:35.064 --> 02:12:47.589]  Do you think this is going to have as much of an effect on the Afghan-slash-Pakistan conflict as the Pentagon Papers with Daniel Ellsberg and the RAM Corporation did to the Vietnam War?
[02:12:48.863 --> 02:12:59.905]  Alex, I've often said that the biggest sea change that I've witnessed in this town of Washington in the 47 years I've been here is that there's no longer in any real sense a free press.
[02:13:00.746 --> 02:13:02.626]  There was back in the 70s.
[02:13:03.046 --> 02:13:04.286]  There was in the 60s.
[02:13:04.746 --> 02:13:07.247]  We got rid of a president because of a free press.
[02:13:07.667 --> 02:13:08.547]  There is none now.
[02:13:09.007 --> 02:13:15.709]  And so it all depends on whether the defunct fourth estate has been replaced by a vibrant
[02:13:17.150 --> 02:13:18.793]  That's the good news, folks.
[02:13:19.454 --> 02:13:22.738]  There's a fifth estate out there, a free media.
[02:13:22.758 --> 02:13:25.042]  The medium is the ether.
[02:13:25.702 --> 02:13:32.011]  It's not susceptible of control by governments or advertisers or corporations which don't own it.
[02:13:33.052 --> 02:13:43.418]  And we have the WikiLeaks phenomenon and many other phenomena that feed on the availability of this wonderful resource.
[02:13:43.959 --> 02:13:55.185]  And so even though the Fourth Estate is dead, and we should duly mourn it because it's a travesty to have those folks stenographing here in the White House, the Fifth Estate is vibrant.
[02:13:55.346 --> 02:13:57.387]  And so I think that if people
[02:13:58.388 --> 02:14:13.290]  Are given enough information, you know, it's impossible for everybody to read all these army documents, but if if there's a if people know where to look for real information on this and that's the missing link.
[02:14:14.651 --> 02:14:40.329]  And speaking around town here, I've been referring often to the WikiLeaks exposure of that turkey shoot, that god-awful turkey shoot that our soldiers there in that Apache helicopter gunship, the gun barrel photography, the video on that, with sound, showing our young people just floating over the turkey shoot of about a dozen Iraqi civilians minding their own business,
[02:14:40.929 --> 02:14:43.271]  Uh, severely injuring two children.
[02:14:44.132 --> 02:14:49.215]  Now, when I ask people about that, nobody knows about it.
[02:14:49.776 --> 02:14:55.440]  Maybe out of a very progressive audience of 100 people, five people say, oh yeah, I read something about that.
[02:14:55.660 --> 02:15:01.585]  And only two of those have taken the trouble to go up onto their URL line and put in collateral
[02:15:02.225 --> 02:15:02.586]  Murder.
[02:15:02.886 --> 02:15:03.627]  That's all you need.
[02:15:04.007 --> 02:15:05.208]  Collateral murder.
[02:15:05.308 --> 02:15:06.910]  Now, Ray, we're running out of time.
[02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:14.277]  This is key info you've been covering, but we've only got this segment, what's left, and the short segment coming up with you today, and I appreciate the time.
[02:15:15.058 --> 02:15:19.122]  But going back to something you just mentioned briefly, now we see cybersecurity
[02:15:20.236 --> 02:15:26.642]  We read about Top Secret USA, 854,000 private individuals with the highest security level.
[02:15:27.423 --> 02:15:29.825]  We know they're training the military for domestic operations.
[02:15:30.185 --> 02:15:32.607]  The White House admits they want to start censoring the Internet.
[02:15:32.928 --> 02:15:34.029]  Cass Sunstein does.
[02:15:34.549 --> 02:15:42.917]  And it looks like the system realizes it's not going to get away with all this corruption if they don't start curtailing the web.
[02:15:42.937 --> 02:15:43.918]  Are you concerned about that?
[02:15:44.761 --> 02:16:10.772]  I am, and specifically because the General, now four-star General Keith Alexander, is the same fellow who lied to Congressman Rush Holt, who's on the House Intelligence Committee and went out there to NSA in December of 2007 and asked Alexander, you're not eavesdropping on American citizens, are you?
[02:16:12.022 --> 02:16:15.423]  Oh no, that's against our first commandment.
[02:16:16.224 --> 02:16:19.345]  And James Risen's article came out just a week later.
[02:16:19.905 --> 02:16:24.387]  So Alexander, you know in my day we used to think that army officers shouldn't lie.
[02:16:24.427 --> 02:16:27.648]  Well, he lied to his congressional overseer.
[02:16:27.688 --> 02:16:29.008]  That's a crime, okay?
[02:16:29.389 --> 02:16:36.251]  And now he is in charge of all this cyberspace stuff, security, offensive stuff, and still
[02:16:37.271 --> 02:16:44.995]  And now the Washington Post says Obama wants to search everybody's computers and ISPs without warrants now, something they're already doing.
[02:16:45.355 --> 02:17:02.162]  So we've gone from Bush lying three years ago and saying, we're not spying on you without warrants, that's illegal, and to this general doing it, to him now being the head of it and saying, yeah, we're listening to everything you're doing, and Google is in Wired Magazine today saying, we're with the CIA watching all of you in real time.
[02:17:02.202 --> 02:17:05.063]  So they've gone from saying, oh, we would never do that, to yeah,
[02:17:05.603 --> 02:17:06.764]  Yeah, we're watching everything.
[02:17:07.044 --> 02:17:09.705]  You know what the saving grace is here, Alex?
[02:17:10.205 --> 02:17:19.849]  The saving grace is that by adding more straw or more hay to the haystack, it makes it even more difficult to find the needles.
[02:17:20.410 --> 02:17:22.891]  Now, maybe you and I are getting special treatment.
[02:17:23.431 --> 02:17:33.660]  But if you deluge, if you deluge the system with more and more intercepted coverage, just think of the billions and billions of things that they collect every day in NSA.
[02:17:34.541 --> 02:17:37.623]  It's funny in terms of them running down patriots like us.
[02:17:37.964 --> 02:17:43.648]  It's not so funny when there are real terrorists out there and they can't find this natal in the haystack.
[02:17:44.489 --> 02:17:44.989]  Needle in the haystack!
[02:17:45.009 --> 02:17:46.691]  Yeah, Alex, those folks all look like us though, you know?
[02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:13.540]  I don't know.
[02:18:32.054 --> 02:18:39.036]  Unless, just like torture doesn't work, unless you want fake confessions and to scare people, unless they know none of this really works, they can just claim their intel shows it.
[02:19:01.357 --> 02:19:12.845]  Yeah, in part, it's what I consider to be the biggest corporate welfare program in our country since the Strategic Defense Initiative, you know, the anti-ballistic missile thing.
[02:19:12.865 --> 02:19:13.385]  Star Wars.
[02:19:13.626 --> 02:19:14.826]  Star Wars, yeah.
[02:19:15.007 --> 02:19:21.011]  What you got here is two and a half times as big
[02:19:21.881 --> 02:19:26.462]  a intelligence budget now, as was the case before 9-11.
[02:19:27.022 --> 02:19:31.083]  Now, that's $75 billion, Alex.
[02:19:31.763 --> 02:19:43.005]  And what we could do in this country with $75 billion, I hate to tell you how many schools we could build, how many teachers we could train and retain, and all the other... How many bridges we could fix?
[02:19:43.045 --> 02:19:45.766]  We got a short five-minute segment coming up and then Ray's gotta go.
[02:19:46.066 --> 02:19:48.987]  Let's get into Iran and the green lighting for that attack.
[02:19:49.127 --> 02:19:49.747]  Is it on?
[02:19:50.307 --> 02:19:51.627]  We're going to talk to him straight ahead.
[02:19:51.667 --> 02:19:52.927]  This is vital info.
[02:19:53.167 --> 02:19:58.868]  Stay with us.
[02:20:02.589 --> 02:20:05.670]  If you're in a service business, that's money ringing in your ears.

[02:20:59.818 --> 02:21:02.340]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:04.581]  This time warns of Greek-style U.S.
[02:21:04.621 --> 02:21:05.342]  debt crises.
[02:21:05.542 --> 02:21:06.303]  You heard me right.
[02:21:06.563 --> 02:21:08.984]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S.
[02:21:09.044 --> 02:21:12.427]  economy, its debt, and the current Greek economic meltdown.
[02:21:12.707 --> 02:21:19.572]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[02:21:20.072 --> 02:21:21.233]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:21.333 --> 02:21:28.338]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[02:21:28.518 --> 02:21:35.944]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising interest rates spell economic disaster.
[02:21:36.364 --> 02:21:40.067]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[02:21:40.307 --> 02:21:42.370]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[02:21:42.390 --> 02:21:44.393]  Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[02:21:44.553 --> 02:21:46.615]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[02:21:46.636 --> 02:21:46.916]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:59.850 --> 02:22:04.692]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:22:04.813 --> 02:22:05.573]  What have we got?
[02:22:05.793 --> 02:22:07.914]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:22:08.254 --> 02:22:08.995]  A republic.
[02:22:09.255 --> 02:22:11.836]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:22:11.896 --> 02:22:13.817]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:22:14.157 --> 02:22:16.078]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:22:16.198 --> 02:22:17.479]  So they think they own our land?
[02:22:17.879 --> 02:22:19.000]  They think they own our water?
[02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:19.600]  Children?
[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:20.580]  Our education?
[02:22:20.921 --> 02:22:21.561]  Our money?
[02:22:21.741 --> 02:22:25.403]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:22:25.763 --> 02:22:29.427]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:22:29.467 --> 02:22:30.429]  You're being warned!
[02:22:30.729 --> 02:22:31.570]  We have the facts.
[02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:32.871]  We have the Constitution.
[02:22:32.911 --> 02:22:33.813]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:22:33.833 --> 02:22:34.674]  We have common law.
[02:22:34.714 --> 02:22:36.976]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:37.257 --> 02:22:41.021]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:22:41.121 --> 02:22:45.905]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:22:46.085 --> 02:22:47.467]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:22:47.587 --> 02:22:48.407]  Don't tread on me.

[02:22:59.795 --> 02:23:01.857]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[02:23:02.317 --> 02:23:05.420]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[02:23:05.881 --> 02:23:13.868]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[02:23:14.368 --> 02:23:19.293]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food?
[02:23:19.853 --> 02:23:24.958]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[02:23:25.458 --> 02:23:33.004]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness, and put up tons of free food too.
[02:23:33.505 --> 02:23:38.509]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[02:23:38.970 --> 02:23:40.191]  Our foods are their enemy.
[02:23:40.771 --> 02:23:46.236]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.

[02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:52.863]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[02:23:52.883 --> 02:23:54.364]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence!
[02:24:01.843 --> 02:24:03.725]  Okay, let's move quick with Ray McGovern.
[02:24:04.345 --> 02:24:06.988]  It looks like they're lining up an attack on Iran.
[02:24:07.008 --> 02:24:10.831]  We're seeing all these different government leaders say that it's on in the next three months.
[02:24:10.891 --> 02:24:11.972]  Is that saber-rattling?
[02:24:12.893 --> 02:24:14.374]  I think it's more than saber-rattling.
[02:24:14.855 --> 02:24:16.956]  Let me give you a little background, Alex.
[02:24:18.378 --> 02:24:23.102]  Iran's alleged attempt to build a nuclear bomb.
[02:24:23.971 --> 02:24:25.033]  A red herring, folks.
[02:24:25.413 --> 02:24:26.054]  A red herring.
[02:24:26.675 --> 02:24:36.287]  The CIA and 15 other intelligence agencies decided, made a judgment, at the end of 2007, that Iran had stopped working on a nuclear weapon.
[02:24:37.006 --> 02:24:41.667]  Not on the whole nuclear program, but on the nuclear weapon, and that judgment holds, okay?
[02:24:41.767 --> 02:24:42.728]  It holds till today.
[02:24:42.748 --> 02:24:48.029]  The new estimate is being updated, is updating that, but so far that judgment holds.
[02:24:48.089 --> 02:24:55.152]  Now, number two, Iran has agreed to ship half of its low-enriched uranium out of country.
[02:24:56.292 --> 02:24:56.552]  Half!
[02:24:57.313 --> 02:24:57.693]  Wow.
[02:24:58.214 --> 02:25:10.606]  You would think that the Israelis and the U.S., those who are afraid of a nuclear weapon in Iran, they jump up and down and say, wow, that lessens the chances by about 50%.
[02:25:11.066 --> 02:25:16.051]  Instead, they go into sanctions, they go into other things that are likely to provoke Iran.
[02:25:16.651 --> 02:25:30.296]  Number three, a recent Pew poll shows that in 16 advanced countries, most people believe that it's necessary to attack Iran because of its alleged nuclear weapon.
[02:25:30.556 --> 02:25:30.876]  Okay?
[02:25:31.396 --> 02:25:32.617]  What's the most important thing?
[02:25:32.637 --> 02:25:38.079]  The most important thing is what Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu thinks of our president.
[02:25:39.459 --> 02:25:52.084]  The recent encounter that they had in the White House, where Obama fawned all over him, didn't mention the settlements, didn't mention the American citizen that Netanyahu's forces killed just two weeks before.
[02:25:53.305 --> 02:25:56.606]  Netanyahu has the impression of our president as a wuss.
[02:25:57.913 --> 02:25:58.634]  I'm from the Bronx.
[02:25:58.654 --> 02:26:01.695]  That's a combination between a wimp and a pussycat.
[02:26:02.396 --> 02:26:18.666]  And if that's his judgment, which I'm convinced it is, he's about ready to use what he considers to be his ace in the hole, the Israel lobby in this country, and do what he wishes to do with respect to Iran.
[02:26:18.706 --> 02:26:19.387]  How would it work?
[02:26:20.027 --> 02:26:26.552]  He'd send his fighter bombers just up to Iraqi airspace, which we still control, for one more month.
[02:26:27.092 --> 02:26:29.894]  He would say, he'd call, there'd be the 4 a.m.
[02:26:30.015 --> 02:26:31.756]  telephone call to Obama.
[02:26:32.016 --> 02:26:41.223]  Mr. Obama, I just want to let you know, we discovered some really bad stuff about nuclear weapons in Iran, so our planes are going through your airspace now.
[02:26:41.863 --> 02:26:45.126]  Make sure you tell Mike Mullen not to shoot any of them down.
[02:26:45.806 --> 02:26:52.952]  Now, there isn't one person in Washington, Alex, that thinks that Obama would have the courage to say, no, no, no, you don't.
[02:26:53.012 --> 02:26:54.133]  We're going to shoot them down.
[02:26:54.153 --> 02:26:57.455]  We are not going to shoot any Israeli planes down.
[02:26:57.495 --> 02:26:58.796]  Netanyahu knows that.
[02:26:59.196 --> 02:27:05.401]  He knows he can attack Iran, and Iran will retaliate, and we'll be in the mix big time, okay?
[02:27:05.761 --> 02:27:08.904]  The other thing that he looks at, Netanyahu does, is the election.
[02:27:09.925 --> 02:27:17.573]  Our president has shown himself allergic to do anything that would possibly put any Jewish or Israeli noses out of joint before the election.
[02:27:18.033 --> 02:27:19.174]  And so this is the time.
[02:27:19.194 --> 02:27:27.163]  I will predict that the chances are better than even that Israel will start a war with Iran next month.
[02:27:27.323 --> 02:27:27.983]  That's August 2010.
[02:27:30.618 --> 02:27:33.459]  So it's definitely going into the green light phase.
[02:27:33.679 --> 02:27:34.960]  And what about false flags?
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:45.264]  We saw Robert Shapiro in the Financial Times say Obama has to have an Oklahoma City or 9-11 to look strong to the public for us to win the elections.
[02:27:45.384 --> 02:27:46.625]  I mean, that was an amazing statement.
[02:27:47.495 --> 02:27:52.097]  Yeah, I, you know, it's just a trifle more cynical than I'm willing to go.
[02:27:52.297 --> 02:28:00.180]  I see Obama as first and foremost 90% a politician, not a constitutional lawyer, not a guy that cares about our troops.
[02:28:00.661 --> 02:28:11.225]  And it's on that basis that I judge that he considers it just not a politically feasible thing to put the reins on Netanyahu given the strength of the Likud lobby in this country.
[02:28:11.525 --> 02:28:12.946]  Well, what do you at your gut think?
[02:28:12.966 --> 02:28:15.408]  You say more than 50 percent.
[02:28:15.868 --> 02:28:19.031]  I mean, I know you're hedging there, but clearly they're moving towards it.
[02:28:19.951 --> 02:28:23.894]  We've had the former head of the CIA, Hayden, say it's inexorable, it's going to happen.
[02:28:24.235 --> 02:28:26.136]  We hear all these noises coming out.
[02:28:26.616 --> 02:28:28.978]  Ahmadinejad believes it's going to happen in the next three months.
[02:28:28.998 --> 02:28:29.839]  You're saying August.
[02:28:30.407 --> 02:28:38.713]  Well, the thing is, Alex, that you can never be real definitive in these predictions, because it still is in Obama's power to prevent this.
[02:28:39.393 --> 02:28:47.639]  And indeed, we veteran intelligence professionals for sanity are drafting a memorandum to the President right now, like tonight, okay?
[02:28:48.079 --> 02:28:55.024]  And what we're going to say is, you better publicly say, you better publicly tell Netanyahu, don't do it.
[02:28:55.585 --> 02:28:58.847]  We're not going to support you if you do, and that's enough to turn it off.
[02:28:59.147 --> 02:29:01.569]  And that's going to be at ConsortiumNews.com?
[02:29:02.029 --> 02:29:02.790]  Yes, it will be.
[02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:03.931]  Probably about three days.
[02:29:04.551 --> 02:29:05.892]  ConsortiumNews.com.
[02:29:05.932 --> 02:29:13.118]  We need to get this public statement with all of your expert analysis and bombard the White House and Congress with this report?
[02:29:14.058 --> 02:29:15.159]  Yeah, I would suggest that.
[02:29:15.279 --> 02:29:15.860]  That would be great.
[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:17.081]  And maybe we can turn it off.
[02:29:17.762 --> 02:29:18.983]  Oh, we got about 30 seconds left.
[02:29:19.063 --> 02:29:21.345]  Anything else we can do to try to avert World War III?
[02:29:21.565 --> 02:29:35.576]  Well, I think you call your congresspeople, you call your senators, and tell them that, you know, we're past the point where we're going to be diddled by a country that pretends to be our ally and gets us in a whole peck of trouble in the Middle East.
[02:29:36.236 --> 02:29:40.619]  All right, ConsortiumNews.com is where you can read all of the great reports by Ray McGovern.
[02:29:41.080 --> 02:29:42.621]  Our website's InfoWars.com.
[02:29:42.681 --> 02:29:43.662]  Ray, talk to you again soon.
[02:29:45.492 --> 02:29:48.375]  Well, I sure hope that, uh, we don't have World War III.
[02:29:48.395 --> 02:29:50.918]  We're gonna come back and look at... We're on the march.
[02:29:51.439 --> 02:29:53.021]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.962 --> 02:29:56.645]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.278 --> 02:30:03.501]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:03.821 --> 02:30:04.101]  Number 1.
[02:30:04.741 --> 02:30:07.883]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:08.164 --> 02:30:08.724]  Number 2.
[02:30:09.024 --> 02:30:13.567]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:13.907 --> 02:30:14.368]  It's true.
[02:30:14.668 --> 02:30:19.211]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:19.531 --> 02:30:20.071]  Number 3.
[02:30:20.351 --> 02:30:23.653]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:23.934 --> 02:30:27.636]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:27.836 --> 02:30:28.397]  Number 4.
[02:30:28.637 --> 02:30:30.999]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:34.783]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:35.084 --> 02:30:35.624]  Number 5.
[02:30:35.864 --> 02:30:39.789]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:40.029 --> 02:30:44.794]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:33:05.348 --> 02:33:11.030]  We're going to get a big update here in just a few minutes from Bill Berg on the whole birth certificate issue.
[02:33:11.330 --> 02:33:18.813]  We know he gave up his citizenship to become an Indonesian citizen, making him ineligible, but we'll talk about all the big developments since we had him on a few months ago.
[02:33:18.833 --> 02:33:22.995]  A lot of states moving to pass laws to make him show it coming up in the next election.
[02:33:23.675 --> 02:33:33.964]  But he's so politically destroyed now, even the Democratic Party is talking about running somebody else against him in the primaries coming up in 2011 for the 2012 elections.
[02:33:34.624 --> 02:33:41.570]  But before we go to Phil Berg, the father of the birther movement, I want to tell you about a few great sponsors.

[02:34:43.716 --> 02:34:46.860]  I've noticed since Levi's is made out of the country, I can't buy them anymore.
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:50.324]  They just split and break and don't... They're just total junk, unfortunately.
[02:34:50.584 --> 02:34:51.966]  This is made in America.
[02:34:52.066 --> 02:34:53.307]  They're high quality jeans.

[02:35:05.119 --> 02:35:06.700]  And I really love their motorcycle jeans.
[02:35:07.361 --> 02:35:09.503]  They've got Kevlar sewn into them.
[02:35:09.523 --> 02:35:10.304]  You can't beat that.
[02:35:10.664 --> 02:35:11.846]  So gussetclothing.com.
[02:35:14.315 --> 02:35:20.077]  Now going to Phil J. Berg, a former Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania, former candidate for governor of the U.S.
[02:35:20.497 --> 02:35:30.680]  Senate, Democratic primaries, former chair of the Democratic Party in Montgomery County, former member of the Democratic State Committee and attorney with offices in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, and an active member in Philadelphia.
[02:35:31.520 --> 02:35:35.501]  He is a paid life member of the NAACP and a volunteer fire police for 27 years.
[02:35:35.521 --> 02:35:36.581]  And Phil Berg
[02:35:39.696 --> 02:35:44.182]  Early on, I was one of the first person to credibly start asking about the birth certificate.
[02:35:44.563 --> 02:35:55.619]  And so, sir, for those that just joined us, base, you know, state the basic facts of the birther movement and then the key information on Indonesia and all the new developments that have unfolded since then.
[02:35:56.414 --> 02:35:57.375]  Sure, pleasure to be on.
[02:35:57.435 --> 02:35:59.056]  It's an honor to be on your show, Alex.
[02:35:59.096 --> 02:36:00.156]  Good to have you here.
[02:36:00.176 --> 02:36:04.178]  I respect you and you have a great audience out there and hello Alex Jones fans.
[02:36:04.939 --> 02:36:07.160]  Phil Berg here and you gave me a great introduction.
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:13.804]  This is now my 29th year being a volunteer fire police and we all have to give back to our community.
[02:36:14.344 --> 02:36:16.246]  And I'm giving back to our country right now.
[02:36:16.306 --> 02:36:24.112]  This is now my 23rd month in pursuing Obama, who is, in my new name for him, he's a complete imposter.
[02:36:24.493 --> 02:36:26.795]  He's a phony, a fraud, but he's an imposter.
[02:36:27.255 --> 02:36:28.896]  And we have to do something about it.
[02:36:29.617 --> 02:36:32.139]  I'll get into the latest, it's still pending in the courts.
[02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:37.504]  How I got involved in this, someone called me up and said, have you heard the rumor that Obama's not natural born?
[02:36:38.304 --> 02:36:47.010]  I did a little bit, and I did some checking, and I filed the first lawsuit against Obama, August 21st, 2008, before the Democratic National Convention.
[02:36:47.030 --> 02:37:00.078]  And at that time, I sued Obama and the Democratic National Committee, and I figured that the Democratic National Committee would question Obama, and therefore, you know, either produce documentation that he's natural born, or not nominate him.
[02:37:01.179 --> 02:37:09.449]  There was collusion there between the Democratic National Committee because they didn't do anything and they actually have joined forces in fighting my lawsuits.
[02:37:09.569 --> 02:37:14.495]  I ended up filing three lawsuits and about another hundred lawsuits have been filed around the country.
[02:37:14.555 --> 02:37:17.438]  Most of them dismissed on the area of standing.
[02:37:17.498 --> 02:37:20.442]  The courts have said that no one has the right to challenge the Constitution.
[02:37:21.062 --> 02:37:21.863]  Unbelievable.
[02:37:22.303 --> 02:37:31.450]  But that's the court system now, and if the national media had done what they should have done, and that is properly vet Obama, he never would have been nominated.
[02:37:31.930 --> 02:37:38.335]  What the national media did to Sarah Palin is what they should have done to Obama, and he would not be where he is.
[02:37:38.415 --> 02:37:42.558]  And the national media is shaking a little, but they're still covering for Obama.
[02:37:43.078 --> 02:37:56.545]  The biggest thing is, two months before I got involved, to quell the rumors, on the Obama campaign website, they put a document up there called a COLB, Certification of Live Birth, trying to indicate that Obama was born in Hawaii.
[02:37:57.005 --> 02:37:59.307]  The document, by experts, has been proven.
[02:37:59.747 --> 02:38:02.989]  We have experts that have said it's a phony, it's been altered.
[02:38:03.389 --> 02:38:09.052]  At the very bottom it says, if there's any alteration of this document, the document is invalid.
[02:38:09.712 --> 02:38:09.972]  I don't know.
[02:38:29.343 --> 02:38:29.943]  And the feet.
[02:38:30.084 --> 02:38:32.768]  I mean, it normally has the ink-stamped feet.
[02:38:32.808 --> 02:38:36.113]  I mean, I have a copy of that with myself, so it's this receipt.
[02:38:36.634 --> 02:38:39.398]  And they've acted very, very secretive and will never release it.
[02:38:39.839 --> 02:38:43.424]  But then you brought out even more important intel, and that's why I was neutral on this.
[02:38:44.451 --> 02:39:08.289]  In the last two and a half years, but leaning towards it being true, and I respect you and others, but then when we learned that he did give up his citizenship, that his real name is Barry Sitaro, that when you give up your citizenship to that nation, you then are not eligible to be president, any way you slice this, he's ineligible, and then the cover-up just adds to the fact of where there's smoke, there's fire.
[02:39:08.897 --> 02:39:28.992]  Right, and you gave a great analysis there, and let me just explain that it's hard for Obama to get out of it, because in the two books that he has had about his life so young, one of them says he found his birth certificate, so he has his birth certificate, so you know, why hasn't he produced the birth certificate at this time?
[02:39:29.032 --> 02:39:37.758]  And the other thing is, he states that his parents were divorced, and he mentions that his mother remarried, because he mentions in his book
[02:39:38.278 --> 02:39:42.201]  That his stepfather returned to Indonesia before his mother and he did.
[02:39:42.661 --> 02:39:51.246]  And that's significant because he mentioned his stepfather and we have the school record which you are very correct Alex, his name is Barry Sotoro.
[02:39:51.686 --> 02:39:55.649]  So if he hasn't legally changed his name since then and there's no evidence he did,
[02:39:56.289 --> 02:39:57.470]  And he was known in college as Barry.
[02:39:57.530 --> 02:40:00.553]  He's even called into radio shows in the last year saying, hey, this is Barry.
[02:40:16.545 --> 02:40:20.490]  Yep, I mean the guy is, he's such an imposter, it's unbelievable.
[02:40:20.530 --> 02:40:29.903]  What about the new videos, two of them of his wife saying, you know, he was born in Kenya and, and, and, you know, we went back to Kenya, the place of, you know, the place of his birth.
[02:40:30.203 --> 02:40:33.488]  I mean she's, she's just out there like it's a sick joke.
[02:40:34.048 --> 02:40:37.652]  Right, and now that has been released lately, in the past few months, but that's from 2008.
[02:40:37.792 --> 02:40:46.783]  I mean, the overwhelming evidence, and the overwhelming actual evidence, the circumstantial evidence, is overwhelming that Obama was born in Africa.
[02:40:47.203 --> 02:40:49.005]  That he is not natural born.
[02:40:49.466 --> 02:40:52.309]  And because of his status over in Indonesia,
[02:40:52.689 --> 02:41:07.781]  I believe that he came back to the United States of Hawaii at age 10, and I believe that he came back on his Indonesia passport, and then believe it or not, he didn't go through immigration, and therefore he's not only not natural born, he's not naturalized, but he's an illegal alien!
[02:41:08.001 --> 02:41:10.042]  All right, Phil Berg, let's expand on that.
[02:41:10.062 --> 02:41:17.884]  Because the media always says, hey, why would his family put a birth announcement in the newspaper if that isn't true?
[02:41:17.924 --> 02:41:22.905]  Well, if you've got a daughter who's overseas, she's going to write, she's going to call.
[02:41:23.245 --> 02:41:25.025]  I mean, they're going to want him to be a citizen.
[02:41:25.045 --> 02:41:28.606]  They're going to want to cover their bases and carry out this fraud.
[02:41:28.706 --> 02:41:32.407]  They were high-powered foundation people, you know, tied into intelligence.
[02:41:32.627 --> 02:41:34.148]  The evidence is clear.
[02:41:34.668 --> 02:41:35.708]  I mean, that's happened
[02:41:35.788 --> 02:41:40.870]  Well, it doesn't really even say he was born in the United States.
[02:41:40.970 --> 02:41:45.232]  It said he was born.
[02:41:45.893 --> 02:41:48.394]  My children live in different states.
[02:41:48.494 --> 02:41:52.115]  One of my daughter-in-law is expecting.
[02:41:52.476 --> 02:41:57.678]  Last year, when one of my grandchildren was born, I put an announcement in a paper here locally where I live.
[02:41:58.238 --> 02:42:00.699]  That doesn't mean they live here because they don't live here.
[02:42:00.719 --> 02:42:07.460]  And also, Hawaii permitted the cold being given for someone up to a year after birth.
[02:42:07.861 --> 02:42:19.463]  So, you know, they hang their head on this cold and they hang on this two newspaper announcement of a birth on a street address which people checked out and people there said there was never a black child living there.
[02:42:19.864 --> 02:42:21.464]  So that to me is not evidence.
[02:42:21.904 --> 02:42:35.613]  Like, on our website we have the tape of Sarah Obama, that's his step-grandmother, in Swahili, and we have the translation stating that she was in the hospital when he was born in Bombasa, Kenya, on August 4th, 1961.
[02:42:35.833 --> 02:42:43.838]  And they act suspicious of grabbing and detaining reporters that go over there time and time again.
[02:42:44.198 --> 02:42:45.559]  So, very suspicious.
[02:42:46.319 --> 02:42:51.964]  Absolutely, and may she rest in peace, but his white grandmother in Hawaii, he never saw the press near her.
[02:42:52.585 --> 02:42:57.229]  She would have known where he was born, she would have known facts about it, but she never got to the press.
[02:42:57.589 --> 02:43:03.855]  And also, this is the woman that meant so much to him during his lifetime, yet when she died he didn't even fly back for her funeral.
[02:43:04.375 --> 02:43:11.949]  You know, he did it like a month later, but also two weeks before that he said she's definitely ill and I'm gonna fly out in a half hour to see her.
[02:43:12.490 --> 02:43:17.038]  Then he changed his mind and flew out two days later, and if she's such an important person...
[02:43:17.674 --> 02:43:19.015]  Why didn't he take his wife with him?
[02:43:19.075 --> 02:43:20.857]  And maybe the kids, but definitely his wife.
[02:43:21.337 --> 02:43:22.378]  He didn't take his wife with him.
[02:43:22.858 --> 02:43:29.443]  I mean, the whole thing... Nothing makes sense with Obama about this, but what... Let me go back on the thing.
[02:43:29.503 --> 02:43:35.107]  Where I think he's not natural born and not naturalized, that's one of the cases I have pending now in the D.C.
[02:43:35.148 --> 02:43:36.248]  Circuit Court of Appeals.
[02:43:36.268 --> 02:43:37.549]  That's the Washington, D.C.
[02:43:38.930 --> 02:43:45.075]  Court of Appeals, which affirmed recently the decision to not let my case go forward, but I've now asked for a court in bond.
[02:43:45.155 --> 02:43:47.237]  I've asked for the entire court to hear my case.
[02:43:47.837 --> 02:44:01.616]  There I'm alleging that Obama is not natural born, not naturalized, but he's an illegal alien and therefore his term at the United States Senate from Illinois was fraud, therefore the salary and benefits he received should be returned to the U.S.
[02:44:01.657 --> 02:44:03.279]  Treasury, which is about a million dollars.
[02:44:04.365 --> 02:44:06.146]  Those type cases are sealed.
[02:44:06.226 --> 02:44:08.087]  When I have it sealed, people wondered why.
[02:44:08.247 --> 02:44:12.989]  All those type cases, which are called false claim factor, CUI-TEM cases, are sealed.
[02:44:13.509 --> 02:44:16.790]  They're mainly used in Medicaid and Medicare fraud cases.
[02:44:17.230 --> 02:44:21.192]  And they're sealed because the person you're bringing it against is not notified of the case.
[02:44:21.652 --> 02:44:30.056]  It goes to the Justice Department and the Attorney General's Office for them to review the case in 60 days and make a decision of, one, are they going to prosecute the case?
[02:44:30.516 --> 02:44:32.797]  Two, are they going to let the person who brought the case
[02:44:33.237 --> 02:44:37.342]  In this case, what's called a relager, or three, dismiss the case.
[02:44:37.762 --> 02:44:39.424]  Very few cases are dismissed.
[02:44:39.925 --> 02:44:42.408]  They decide to dismiss my case against Obama.
[02:44:43.234 --> 02:44:46.095]  And I raise the issue of conflict of interest.
[02:44:46.515 --> 02:44:54.078]  And Alex, if this scenario is not conflict of interest, we should take those words out of the dictionary and out of the legal dictionary and out of the legal system.
[02:44:54.598 --> 02:44:59.620]  I mean the fact that the decision is made by the Department of Justice and the Attorney General's office.
[02:44:59.940 --> 02:45:00.800]  Who's the head of that?
[02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:02.360]  The Attorney General of the United States.
[02:45:02.801 --> 02:45:04.241]  Who's the Attorney General of the United States?
[02:45:04.341 --> 02:45:05.021]  Eric Holder.
[02:45:05.461 --> 02:45:09.743]  Well, Eric Holder, number one, was a senior member of Obama's campaign staff.
[02:45:10.283 --> 02:45:17.367]  Number two, he was one of three individuals selected by Obama to select a Vice President who eventually selected Biden.
[02:45:17.828 --> 02:45:25.933]  And number three, he was nominated, appointed, and confirmed as Attorney General, the highest law enforcement officer in the country, who reports to the President.
[02:45:26.293 --> 02:45:30.135]  So if that person is not a conflict of interest, I don't know what is.
[02:45:30.635 --> 02:45:32.957]  So that's where I'm at now with the D.C.
[02:45:32.997 --> 02:45:33.717]  Court of Appeals.
[02:45:34.158 --> 02:45:35.458]  Hopefully, they'll have a court involved.
[02:45:35.538 --> 02:45:37.339]  If not, we're going to take that case up to the U.S.
[02:45:37.380 --> 02:45:37.980]  Supreme Court.
[02:45:39.138 --> 02:45:40.059]  Well, let me say this.
[02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:43.103]  You've definitely won in the court of public opinion.
[02:45:43.123 --> 02:45:49.051]  A lot of Congress people and others will come out and say that they think the birth certificate issue is legitimate.
[02:45:49.272 --> 02:45:51.335]  There's no doubt the Indonesian citizenship.
[02:45:51.575 --> 02:45:53.678]  We've got a president with a fake, made-up name.
[02:45:54.018 --> 02:45:54.839]  That's confirmed.
[02:45:56.141 --> 02:46:17.631]  That's why the controlled corporate media keeps getting so mad that we won't shut up about this, and that it just keeps gaining ground in national polls, because when somebody looks at the actual evidence, it is overwhelming that there's a massive cover-up and he's ineligible just on the Indonesian citizenship and name issue, and that's why they've got all of his college records.
[02:46:18.576 --> 02:46:19.296]  So sealed.
[02:46:19.797 --> 02:46:23.058]  And so his approval rating's gone from 85 percent down to 40.
[02:46:23.378 --> 02:46:28.040]  He's at the lowest approval rating of any president this far into their, you know, situation.
[02:46:28.801 --> 02:46:31.182]  But then there's the issue you raised years ago on this show.
[02:46:31.522 --> 02:46:32.602]  He's compromised.
[02:46:32.882 --> 02:46:40.286]  The establishment knows he's an Indonesian citizen, bare minimum, almost certainly born in Kenya, a Kenyan citizen born.
[02:46:40.606 --> 02:46:44.848]  They know that, so imagine how they're able to blackmail him with this information.
[02:46:45.385 --> 02:46:46.825]  Oh, I definitely think he's blackmailed.
[02:46:46.845 --> 02:46:51.587]  I think that's why most of the speeches he gives are on teleprompter.
[02:46:51.927 --> 02:46:52.627]  He's reading them.
[02:46:52.667 --> 02:46:54.768]  He's great to deliver a speech off a teleprompter.
[02:46:55.008 --> 02:46:56.308]  Not as good elsewhere.
[02:46:56.648 --> 02:46:57.809]  But he's told what to say.
[02:46:57.969 --> 02:47:00.449]  And I think our whole country is in jeopardy because of it.
[02:47:00.869 --> 02:47:04.410]  This health care bill is blatantly, as far as I'm concerned, unconstitutional.
[02:47:04.811 --> 02:47:06.151]  And many other things he's doing.
[02:47:06.831 --> 02:47:11.833]  And that's why, and through your help, we had scheduled, if you recall, March Back Memorial Day.
[02:47:11.853 --> 02:47:13.313]  We had to cancel that for certain reasons.
[02:47:14.082 --> 02:47:21.150]  Excuse me, we haven't rescheduled yet, but it looks like we're going to have it in October, getting near election time, because I think people's interest will be up.
[02:47:21.410 --> 02:47:22.691]  Why did you have to reschedule?
[02:47:22.991 --> 02:47:27.496]  Well, because more and more and several groups want to join in with me, and we didn't have enough time to plan it right.
[02:47:27.957 --> 02:47:28.858]  I want to have this March.
[02:47:29.138 --> 02:47:30.980]  We're working on a date now for October.
[02:47:31.460 --> 02:47:34.242]  And I want it to be the largest march in Washington, D.C.
[02:47:34.282 --> 02:47:37.604]  history, because this affront to our U.S.
[02:47:37.664 --> 02:47:45.168]  Constitution is the biggest hoax against the Constitution, against our country, against our citizens, in 324 years.
[02:47:45.528 --> 02:47:49.271]  I'm sorry, 234 years since our Constitution came into effect.
[02:47:49.691 --> 02:47:54.574]  You know, the comparison has to be for people out there that question Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:47:54.954 --> 02:47:59.157]  People have talked to him for 10, 15 years about running for president, and he constantly
[02:48:00.197 --> 02:48:01.438]  Amend the Constitution.
[02:48:01.498 --> 02:48:02.799]  I was born in Austria.
[02:48:02.959 --> 02:48:04.341]  Amend the Constitution.
[02:48:04.401 --> 02:48:10.686]  I was born... You know, he could just change his name, though, to, like, Belly Bob and say, I was born in California!
[02:48:10.706 --> 02:48:15.310]  He could run on the Obama theory from now on.
[02:48:15.690 --> 02:48:18.032]  Obama is destroying the Constitution.
[02:48:18.472 --> 02:48:22.215]  Obama has basically said, I don't care about the Constitution.
[02:48:22.535 --> 02:48:24.377]  He's basically walking all over the Constitution.
[02:48:24.437 --> 02:48:27.739]  It is a conspiracy theory that I was born in Austria!
[02:48:27.759 --> 02:48:29.900]  I was born in California!
[02:48:30.420 --> 02:48:31.300]  Right, right.
[02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:40.365]  How about Obama, when he was, I think, back in the spring of 2008, when everyone else was saluting the flag, he was standing there with his arm down the side.
[02:48:40.745 --> 02:48:43.966]  How about when he would never wear an American flag lapel pin?
[02:48:44.347 --> 02:48:45.367]  You know, he's changed that.
[02:48:47.388 --> 02:48:51.831]  The biggest thing, as far as I'm concerned, he goes around the world apologizing to the United States.
[02:48:52.272 --> 02:48:54.193]  Then he bows down to the Saudi king.
[02:48:54.233 --> 02:48:56.054]  He bows down to the Japanese emperor.
[02:48:56.355 --> 02:48:57.655]  He bows down to the leader of China.
[02:48:57.675 --> 02:49:00.798]  And then they lie each time and say that he's dropped something.
[02:49:00.978 --> 02:49:06.562]  I mean, he just, oh, your majesty, oh, oh, oh, you're so great.
[02:49:06.582 --> 02:49:08.563]  And they're like, oh, he was picking up something.
[02:49:08.583 --> 02:49:08.984]  Yeah.
[02:49:10.044 --> 02:49:10.805]  He was picking up.
[02:49:11.966 --> 02:49:17.432]  But just what he has done has destroyed the image of the United States around the world.
[02:49:17.692 --> 02:49:18.873]  Your Majesty!
[02:49:18.893 --> 02:49:20.515]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:49:20.855 --> 02:49:29.324]  No, and that's why as soon as we get a date here I'm going to be back on your show and we're going to ask people to come because this is the biggest... I don't care what your issue is with Obama.
[02:49:30.104 --> 02:49:42.652]  But think about it, if your issue is taxation, if your issue is education, if your issue is medical, whatever your issue is, it all falls back on, and I'm appealing in a way to all the Tea Party people, you have different issues out there.
[02:49:42.993 --> 02:49:48.036]  But the main controlling issue is the fact he's a usurper, he's a phony, he's a fraud, he's an imposter.
[02:49:48.476 --> 02:49:55.701]  If I am right, and I know I am, if the courts won't handle this, we the American people getting together can demand
[02:49:56.201 --> 02:50:07.206]  And if we can bring in one to two million people to Washington, D.C., and we can have them there and bring a copy of your birth certificate, and everyone hold over their head their copy, then national media will have to cover this.
[02:50:07.546 --> 02:50:16.830]  And I really believe we can force Obama out of office, because once the American people stand for... See, I believe that not enough American public knows about this.
[02:50:17.270 --> 02:50:22.872]  Because, remember, you need a real, live birth certificate to register your child for little babies.
[02:50:22.892 --> 02:50:23.853]  Well, I mean, listen, listen.
[02:50:24.893 --> 02:50:26.653]  If he had it, he would have released it.
[02:50:27.094 --> 02:50:29.954]  He's been very suspicious about this.
[02:50:29.994 --> 02:50:34.715]  But regardless, let's say we're wrong and he was born in Hawaii, which the evidence shows is not the case.
[02:50:34.735 --> 02:50:35.516]  He was born in Kenya.
[02:50:35.896 --> 02:50:38.716]  His real name is Barry Sotero.
[02:50:39.457 --> 02:50:42.517]  He is an Indonesian citizen and went to an Islamic school.
[02:50:42.557 --> 02:50:44.598]  And I'm not saying it's bad that he went to an Islamic school.
[02:50:45.038 --> 02:50:47.719]  The point is, the guy is as phony as a $3 bill.
[02:50:49.079 --> 02:50:50.903]  Who he says he is.
[02:50:50.983 --> 02:50:52.926]  His name is Barry Sotaro.
[02:50:53.227 --> 02:50:54.549]  Barry Sotaro.
[02:50:54.770 --> 02:50:55.571]  We've got him!
[02:50:55.992 --> 02:50:57.375]  That guy's an imposter!
[02:50:57.395 --> 02:50:58.337]  Phil Berg, you're right.
[02:50:58.377 --> 02:50:58.998]  Final segment.

[02:51:59.775 --> 02:52:02.078]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:02.158 --> 02:52:04.361]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:04.381 --> 02:52:07.285]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:07.706 --> 02:52:12.453]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:12.813 --> 02:52:16.999]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:17.299 --> 02:52:19.642]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:19.762 --> 02:52:22.185]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:22.525 --> 02:52:25.088]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:25.448 --> 02:52:33.057]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:33.377 --> 02:52:38.622]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:38.642 --> 02:52:41.044]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:41.084 --> 02:52:45.068]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:45.308 --> 02:52:46.249]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:46.369 --> 02:52:47.690]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:47.730 --> 02:52:48.731]  Invisible Empire.

[02:54:01.261 --> 02:54:06.404]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:07.084 --> 02:54:09.386]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:10.680 --> 02:54:12.740]  Some of these key stories we haven't had time to get to.
[02:54:12.760 --> 02:54:14.341]  We're up at GCNLive.com.
[02:54:14.401 --> 02:54:16.501]  That's GCNLive.com.
[02:54:16.841 --> 02:54:18.061]  Paul Craig Roberts says U.S.
[02:54:18.102 --> 02:54:19.482]  Treasury is running on fumes.
[02:54:19.522 --> 02:54:20.122]  Key article.
[02:54:20.682 --> 02:54:22.262]  Grim tidings from the Netherlands.
[02:54:22.302 --> 02:54:25.923]  Prince Bernhard's grandchildren continue Bilderberg legacy.
[02:54:26.743 --> 02:54:28.964]  Key report up there.
[02:54:30.164 --> 02:54:38.866]  Also Google and CIA plow through millions into huge record the future monitoring projects.
[02:54:38.886 --> 02:54:39.906]  Steve Watson's got
[02:54:40.734 --> 02:54:43.135]  This article and it's up at GCNLive.com.
[02:54:43.815 --> 02:54:44.576]  Again, here's another one.
[02:54:44.596 --> 02:54:47.297]  Google and CIA fund political pre-crime technology.
[02:54:47.737 --> 02:54:49.578]  Kurt Nemo, also at GCNLive.com.
[02:54:49.618 --> 02:54:51.399]  And all this is also at Infowars.com.
[02:54:51.879 --> 02:54:54.440]  And another big report that Rob Dew wrote.
[02:54:55.320 --> 02:54:57.461]  WorldNet Daily Writer says, fluoride is good for you.
[02:54:57.501 --> 02:54:58.662]  An open letter to the writer.
[02:54:59.002 --> 02:55:01.923]  It's very well documented if you want a lot of key fluoride facts.
[02:55:02.343 --> 02:55:05.025]  That's all at GCNLive.com.
[02:55:05.385 --> 02:55:07.306]  Going back to attorney Phil Berg.
[02:55:08.406 --> 02:55:16.457]  Also, former Deputy Attorney General in Pennsylvania, really the first guy to credibly go after Obama on the birth certificate and the Indonesia issues.
[02:55:16.477 --> 02:55:18.339]  We've got about three, four minutes left.
[02:55:18.460 --> 02:55:19.601]  Any other key developments?
[02:55:19.621 --> 02:55:23.807]  What do you think about states moving to pass laws to force him to give them the birth certificate?
[02:55:24.027 --> 02:55:25.229]  Didn't Arizona pass that?
[02:55:25.888 --> 02:55:30.629]  No, it was introduced and the House passed it, I think, and the Senate didn't pass it.
[02:55:31.810 --> 02:55:36.151]  But you can know there's a phony here because Representative Posey in Florida, a U.S.
[02:55:36.191 --> 02:55:45.534]  Congressman, Republican, introduced legislation that all presidential candidates as of 2012 must show that their natural-born status to be qualified.
[02:55:45.974 --> 02:55:48.635]  About eight other Republicans joined in, but no Democrats.
[02:55:48.675 --> 02:55:50.295]  Now, why did no Democrats join in?
[02:55:50.335 --> 02:55:51.556]  Because they know he's a fraud.
[02:55:51.596 --> 02:55:52.496]  They know he's a phony.
[02:55:53.016 --> 02:56:01.738]  If I may give a pitch here, my website is Obamacrimes.com, O-B-A-M-A-C-R-I-M-E-S dot com dot C-O-M, Obamacrimes.com.
[02:56:02.258 --> 02:56:07.620]  Right now we need some help, we need some money, we're going to raise some money because we want to advertise this march since we have the day.
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.441]  We want as many people in this country to be aware of this.
[02:56:10.841 --> 02:56:12.101]  I believe people in this country.
[02:56:12.501 --> 02:56:13.681]  I do not know about this.
[02:56:13.761 --> 02:56:15.382]  I think the majority of people don't know.
[02:56:15.442 --> 02:56:20.224]  And if they did know, we could have 10 million people in Washington because this is such an outrage.
[02:56:20.544 --> 02:56:26.386]  You know, there's... You might differ on different policies or, you know, Republican ideas, Democrat ideas.
[02:56:26.686 --> 02:56:29.667]  This crosses... Like, I'm a Democrat, but this crosses everything.
[02:56:30.067 --> 02:56:31.887]  This crosses the line completely.
[02:56:32.388 --> 02:56:34.908]  Well, if they can get away with this, the sky's the limit.
[02:56:35.229 --> 02:56:35.949]  Well, I do this.
[02:56:36.029 --> 02:56:37.909]  I say the most important thing we have is what?
[02:56:38.189 --> 02:56:38.710]  Is the U.S.
[02:56:38.750 --> 02:56:39.370]  Constitution.
[02:56:39.950 --> 02:56:41.831]  There's nothing more important than the Constitution.
[02:56:42.351 --> 02:56:46.392]  And the 305, 308 million people in the country deserve to know the truth.
[02:56:46.832 --> 02:56:48.753]  Our forefathers need us to fight for this.
[02:56:49.193 --> 02:56:55.916]  And the men and women who have served valiantly in our wars over the years, 1.6 million died defending our Constitution.
[02:56:55.956 --> 02:56:57.896]  Another 1.6 million have been injured.
[02:56:58.236 --> 02:57:05.439]  And how about the millions of others who haven't, who have served our nation and are still serving our nation, which they shouldn't be over in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:57:06.019 --> 02:57:09.962]  And they're doing to defend this Constitution, which Obama does not treat.
[02:57:10.162 --> 02:57:11.483]  Obama thinks it's trash.
[02:57:11.843 --> 02:57:13.584]  Obama's out for this New World Order.
[02:57:13.924 --> 02:57:15.926]  And the New World Order will not help us.
[02:57:15.986 --> 02:57:17.887]  So I need everyone to join with us.
[02:57:18.427 --> 02:57:19.248]  Spread the word.
[02:57:19.648 --> 02:57:22.650]  You know, such an honor to be on your show again, Alex.
[02:57:22.991 --> 02:57:24.211]  Obamacrimes.com.
[02:57:24.271 --> 02:57:24.692]  Help us.
[02:57:24.732 --> 02:57:27.073]  And as soon as the date comes out, I'm going to be back on your show.
[02:57:27.494 --> 02:57:30.936]  And we're going to make sure that this is the largest march in Washington, D.C.
[02:57:30.996 --> 02:57:33.618]  history, because there's nothing more important than the U.S.
[02:57:33.658 --> 02:57:34.138]  Constitution.
[02:57:34.478 --> 02:57:39.062]  And if we bring Obama down, his government health care, all of it will also be reversed.
[02:57:39.382 --> 02:57:41.744]  Phil Berg, look forward to talking to you as the march nears.
[02:57:41.764 --> 02:57:42.325]  God bless you.
[02:57:42.645 --> 02:57:43.005]  Thank you.
[02:57:43.046 --> 02:57:43.566]  My pleasure.
[02:57:43.826 --> 02:57:44.126]  You bet.
[02:57:44.166 --> 02:57:45.127]  There goes Phil Berg.
[02:57:45.748 --> 02:57:48.710]  We're basically out of time for this hour.
[02:57:48.770 --> 02:57:52.594]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm going to get into the whole Google spying.
[02:57:53.634 --> 02:57:57.916]  And the fact that they claim they can predict the future now by tracking everything that you're doing.
[02:57:57.936 --> 02:58:00.958]  If you don't have an AM and FM that carries all of the show, ask them to.

[02:58:23.268 --> 02:58:27.749]  I mean the show is just exploding and we want to thank all the stations that do pick up the show.
