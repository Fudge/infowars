[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.612]  Confirmation war continues.
[00:00:02.213 --> 00:00:05.198]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:18.356]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:21.178]  It is Sunday, the 27th day of June 2010.
[00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.522]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:32.108]  We're going to be going over the unfortunate fact that the economy is being destroyed by design.
[00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.273]  Biden is saying we can't recover all of the lost jobs.
[00:00:38.693 --> 00:00:45.738]  Bloomberg is reporting that 46 state governments are facing Greek-style deficits all by design.
[00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:56.106]  Record unemployment levels, obviously, here in the United States since the Great Depression, and record numbers in the next month scheduled to go off the unemployment rolls.
[00:00:57.087 --> 00:00:58.228]  So we'll be discussing that.
[00:00:58.428 --> 00:01:02.211]  Also, Obama Internet Kill Switch Plan approved by U.S.
[00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:02.651]  Senate.
[00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:04.813]  That's the tech world headline.
[00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:13.866]  I've been warning people about this for three years since the cybersecurity legislation was written under Hare Bush's tutelage and tenure.
[00:01:14.527 --> 00:01:19.230]  And now it's passed the House, passed the Senate committee, and looks like it has the votes in the full Senate.
[00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.373]  The complete takeover of the Internet by the Pentagon.
[00:01:24.093 --> 00:01:27.876]  They already have the grid in to kill the Internet, to shut it off.
[00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:32.299]  But now they're about to have the law to be able to do it.
[00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.561]  Of course, they did have laws in this country that black people weren't humans.
[00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:43.564]  And they've had laws that young women could be taken and forcibly sterilized if they made under a B plus in high school.
[00:01:44.044 --> 00:01:46.045]  That was going on until the mid-seventies quietly.
[00:01:46.925 --> 00:01:50.046]  So we're going to expose these criminal laws and what's happening.
[00:01:50.066 --> 00:02:02.611]  And the first time they shut the Internet off, it'll be for a few days and say, oh, thank God we had this bill when Al Qaeda struck and attacked the power grid, which isn't hooked to the Internet and shouldn't be hooked to the Internet, but it isn't.
[00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:05.956]  Uh, they can say, see we shut it off only for a few days.
[00:02:06.457 --> 00:02:08.441]  Caused some problems, but it kept you safe.
[00:02:09.082 --> 00:02:13.631]  And then it's, oh we shut it off a few months the next time, and oh see we had to do this, and...
[00:02:14.793 --> 00:02:20.417]  This internet kill switch is only one part of death by a hundred cuts, but it is one of the biggest cuts.
[00:02:20.497 --> 00:02:26.321]  It's a hatchet attack to the direct neck of the internet and the free press.
[00:02:27.142 --> 00:02:28.003]  So that's coming up.
[00:02:28.923 --> 00:02:35.228]  Also, G20 law gives police sweeping powers to arrest people going to the G20 where they hire the regular anarchists.
[00:02:35.728 --> 00:02:41.432]  It even came out two weeks before the G20 met that the police have been caught hiring provocateurs again ahead of it.
[00:02:42.473 --> 00:02:48.538]  Of course, police have been caught before at meetings in Canada, globalist meetings, posing as anarchists.
[00:02:49.438 --> 00:02:50.559]  And the media does two things.
[00:02:50.739 --> 00:03:01.947]  They go and point cameras at police and government provocateurs to demonize all the protesters and say, oh, look at these anarchists who are engaged in violence, as a way to cause a chilling effect against all demonstrations.
[00:03:02.768 --> 00:03:03.971]  And it's working well.
[00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:11.788]  But they also point their cameras always at foundation-funded communists and say, oh, it's communists against capitalism protesting the banks.
[00:03:12.748 --> 00:03:18.131]  The big central banks promote communism for the general public's wealth, which then goes offshore to them.
[00:03:18.591 --> 00:03:21.052]  They promote collectivism at the lower level.
[00:03:21.733 --> 00:03:35.040]  And this is not capitalism having central banks stealing trillions of dollars from us, but this is all part of the semantical deception where the lies are just in the basic terms, and the rules of the political game we're given are lies.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:04:04.549]  uh... so that is coming up uh... as well today also salon ask the question how many americans are targeted for assassination because first we heard it was just a few in foreign battlefields and now we hear americans anywhere pentagon wants to kill an american in austin texas or detroit michigan or albuquerque new mexico or tampa florida or uh... paris france kill kill kill and so they're just quietly setting a precedent so when they give their
[00:04:05.742 --> 00:04:08.846]  It's private contractors or government killers, the order.
[00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:10.307]  They've heard about it on the news.
[00:04:10.388 --> 00:04:12.070]  And men, you've heard about our new powers.
[00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.391]  You've seen it in the news.
[00:04:13.431 --> 00:04:14.573]  You're authorized to do this.
[00:04:15.694 --> 00:04:16.976]  And go forward and kill!
[00:04:18.382 --> 00:04:24.305]  Of course, six years ago Israel bragged in United Press International and AP that they've got hit teams in the U.S.
[00:04:24.345 --> 00:04:25.806]  killing whoever they want, when they want.
[00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:27.767]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:28.228 --> 00:04:35.492]  But I talked to some police officers about an hour ago, a little over an hour ago, before I got down here to the office.
[00:04:35.532 --> 00:04:39.114]  I saw some police officers and I felt the urge to go speak to them.
[00:04:39.134 --> 00:04:40.454]  I'll tell you about that when we come back.
[00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:42.756]  Then we'll get into the end of the Internet.
[00:04:43.596 --> 00:04:52.438]  The end of our national sovereignty, what's happening with the economy, and how we can fight back against these tyrants if we ever choose to want to remove these criminals, these illegitimate criminals.
[00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.431]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:06.872]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:07.612 --> 00:05:11.653]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:12.233 --> 00:05:23.055]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:23.695 --> 00:05:32.697]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:33.197 --> 00:05:38.238]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:45.800]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.881]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:02.830]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.291]  You want answers?
[00:06:05.071 --> 00:06:06.051]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:06.611 --> 00:06:10.172]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:10.812 --> 00:06:14.853]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:06:19.193 --> 00:06:20.134]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:06:20.154 --> 00:06:23.575]  It is Sunday, the 27th day of June 2010.
[00:06:23.655 --> 00:06:38.001]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours, as we are every Sunday, with the abbreviated Sunday broadcast, Transmission Against Tyranny, in a desperate attempt to wake up our fellow humans around the planet.
[00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:56.108]  to the illegitimate criminal corporate takeover known as the New World Order that is happening all over the planet as our governments fall, as legitimate corporations and private companies are taken over by these megacorporations that are now bigger than any one government.
[00:06:57.168 --> 00:06:59.110]  So that is all coming up today.
[00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.592]  I want to get into the economy.
[00:07:01.612 --> 00:07:06.455]  The latest on the hurricane forming in the Gulf and what will that do to all the oil in the Gulf.
[00:07:06.776 --> 00:07:09.918]  Will that blow that oil into the shorelines?
[00:07:10.498 --> 00:07:14.582]  I'll just tell you right now the good news is Hurricane Alex or this tropical storm they say that
[00:07:15.262 --> 00:07:16.363]  Will become a hurricane.
[00:07:16.383 --> 00:07:23.349]  The meteorologists are now saying is not aimed at the northern and eastern areas of the Gulf.
[00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:26.092]  So they're predicting it's not going to blow all that oil.
[00:07:26.152 --> 00:07:32.177]  The majority of the oil is out in the Gulf into the shorelines, thus causing an evacuation now.
[00:07:33.178 --> 00:07:42.066]  But we've been talking to military personnel and others for about a month about the fact that they are being trained for massed force evacuation in the Gulf.
[00:07:43.778 --> 00:07:49.242]  And we've seen the EPA a few weeks ago say there may be evacuations in areas of the Gulf.
[00:07:50.423 --> 00:08:03.432]  And when the big storms come in in the next two months and form, and when the hurricanes come into the Gulf, they will blow these 50 to 100 million, no one knows, barrels of oil, gallons of oil.
[00:08:04.112 --> 00:08:09.316]  It's over 50 million gallons and some reports are
[00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:15.352]  over a hundred million because BP's been so deceptive and I don't think BP even really knows.
[00:08:15.372 --> 00:08:39.289]  The point is there's a lot of oil out there and a hurricane no doubt because their tracks are from the south towards the north will blow that oil into land and it's off-gassing really toxic chemicals so people are really bracing for that and this is going to be even more devastating to the economy on the gulf and the rest of the nation as well so we ain't seen nothing yet
[00:08:40.109 --> 00:08:46.114]  And then I saw a headline by Kurt Nemo at Infowars.com on Friday.
[00:08:46.134 --> 00:08:56.122]  Oil industry insider and CFR member predicts Gulf evacuation and the Washington Post promoted this back on Thursday and Friday.
[00:08:56.462 --> 00:08:59.665]  So we'll be discussing that a little bit later.
[00:09:00.646 --> 00:09:09.544]  in the radio show slash TV show because we are simulcasting this radio broadcast also at PrisonPlanet.TV today.
[00:09:12.813 --> 00:09:20.994]  But before I get into all of the news and your phone calls, I want to tell you a little story of what happened about an hour and 15 minutes ago.
[00:09:21.575 --> 00:09:32.136]  I was driving into the office to do this radio show, and I pulled into a barbecue place called Pokey Joe's to eat a late lunch so I wouldn't have low blood sugar on the air.
[00:09:33.197 --> 00:09:40.258]  And I went in, got my food, sat down in the corner of their main dining room that looks into their back dining room.
[00:09:43.444 --> 00:09:47.747]  Then I noticed four police officers walking in to go in and have something to eat.
[00:09:49.529 --> 00:10:02.639]  And I watched the body language of the families that were eating in the establishment, and I noticed their body language going from one of being happy and laughing and talking to everyone being quiet for about ten minutes.
[00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:10.145]  I'd been there about twenty minutes eating, the police got there, and then I was there about another ten minutes and I watched everyone's body language, because I always watch people,
[00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:14.370]  I wasn't watching the televisions they had hanging up in the dining room.
[00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:20.659]  I was watching people while I was eating and thinking about societal engineering and how the globalists are operating.
[00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:26.828]  And I was writing notes for a voiceover that I'm going to cut tonight on a new film I'm working on that deals with eugenics.
[00:10:27.429 --> 00:10:52.535]  And deals with genetically modified crops, and weather modification, and toxins in the water, and how we're sending crews off in the next few weeks to interview top EPA scientists about how deadly sodium fluoride is in the water, and how the government knows this, and purposefully puts it in the water to cause cumulative bone cancer, organ failure, and reductions in fertility.
[00:10:52.815 --> 00:10:54.896]  And that's all admitted mainline science.
[00:10:56.024 --> 00:11:12.577]  And so I'm sitting there looking at these poor people wanting to warn them they're drinking the tap water and drinking the iced tea that's made out of tap water and thinking about should I go up and just start warning everyone at their tables that this poison is being put in their water under international rules.
[00:11:13.692 --> 00:11:19.773]  Sure, they'll laugh at me and think I'm a kook, but some of them will still go check into the scientific facts.
[00:11:19.873 --> 00:11:30.815]  Kind of like, for 15 years I've been warning you about how your blood's taken at birth in the entire Western world and put in secret Pentagon DNA bioweapons databases.
[00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:38.517]  And that's been declassified the last two years and they admit it is in the Pentagon and Cold Springs Harbor Eugenics, IBM Laboratory, Cold Springs, New York.
[00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:42.252]  I mean, sure, truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:11:42.992 --> 00:11:45.573]  But I thought, you know what, I'm just going to save it for the radio.
[00:11:45.994 --> 00:11:53.357]  I'm not going to do what I do more and more in grocery store lines, at shopping malls, at gas station checkout counters.
[00:11:53.457 --> 00:11:58.559]  I will just start preaching and warning people and holding up the bubble gum and saying, look, you can't find one type of gum.
[00:11:59.179 --> 00:12:02.160]  in here that doesn't have aspartame, even though it's sugar gum.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.721]  This is a chemical toxin on record.
[00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:10.282]  It was developed by the Pentagon as a sweet tasting chemical weapon.
[00:12:11.302 --> 00:12:12.482]  It's highly addictive.
[00:12:12.823 --> 00:12:13.863]  Many poisons are.
[00:12:14.523 --> 00:12:16.904]  You need to understand it's a neurotoxin.
[00:12:16.984 --> 00:12:22.085]  I've interviewed scores of top brain surgeons, neurologists, toxicologists.
[00:12:23.396 --> 00:12:24.737]  But today I didn't do it.
[00:12:24.797 --> 00:12:25.618]  I just shut up.
[00:12:26.038 --> 00:12:29.140]  Because it's a normal human instinct to warn people.
[00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:44.893]  If you saw somebody 3,000 years ago, you know, let's say you lived somewhere in Central Asia, and you saw someone in your village eating a berry that was poison, you would run over and say, don't eat that berry, that's poisonous, if you were older and had that knowledge and understood it.
[00:12:45.888 --> 00:13:11.643]  Or if your people had basically been enslaved by a ruling tribe, and you knew that that ruling tribe was putting a poison in your water to make your people weak, you would hunch down at the well and say, you know, the Bunga tribe is poisoning the water of the Chamumbi tribe, and you should be aware of that, and we should sneak to the river at night and get our own water, and get our people strong enough mentally and physically to be able to try to escape bondage.
[00:13:12.463 --> 00:13:17.145]  But see, today, under this mind control auspice, I'm not supposed to want to warn people.
[00:13:18.105 --> 00:13:29.268]  So the police come in, and I watch everyone in Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, for whatever reason, everyone gets uncomfortable, everyone starts looking down, basically everybody stops talking.
[00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:30.649]  These are good American slaves.
[00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:34.703]  By the media, by the culture, they've been taught to keep their mouths shut.
[00:13:35.364 --> 00:13:38.466]  They've all been made to feel guilty by the media that they're all criminals somehow.
[00:13:38.826 --> 00:13:40.848]  They better all keep their mouths shut in the Pokey Joes.
[00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:47.693]  And the cops realize that the public is scared of them, so they go in the back little dining room by themselves in a corner.
[00:13:47.753 --> 00:13:51.015]  They want to be left alone, but everybody's looking at them through the dining room doors.
[00:13:51.576 --> 00:13:56.159]  There's two doors, open doors there to the back, and I see the families all kind of looking scared.
[00:13:56.199 --> 00:14:00.863]  Everybody's whispering now because the authority of the states there, the states put out the messages
[00:14:01.403 --> 00:14:06.464]  I just saw a report of, the police report admits, a woman that they called the ambulance to come get.
[00:14:06.504 --> 00:14:07.725]  She was 86 years old.
[00:14:08.225 --> 00:14:17.447]  Ten cops came in her house, took her oxygen mask off, so she argued with them, and so they said they felt threatened by her posture in the bed, so they tasered her.
[00:14:18.248 --> 00:14:19.908]  And everybody sees those images.
[00:14:20.508 --> 00:14:23.049]  Whether they're fair or not, that's how people see cops.
[00:14:23.569 --> 00:14:25.870]  So everybody was being quiet in the Pokey Joe.
[00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:30.271]  So it's kind of like an old western movie, where the bad guys come in, everybody gets quiet in the saloon.
[00:14:31.408 --> 00:14:37.879]  Okay, so I'm sitting there basically in the Modern Saloon and I've got my notebooks out and I've got all these government documents in front of me.
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.426]  Some of the latest put out even by the EPA admitting that sodium fluoride is deadly poison.
[00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:46.734]  And I'm on the verge of already standing up and giving a speech and warning people.
[00:14:47.014 --> 00:14:50.839]  Breaking my conditioning to not be ashamed of being a true leader.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:58.427]  Getting out of my comfort zone to stand up and warn people as a natural, healthy human would do.
[00:14:58.927 --> 00:15:00.409]  As a natural guardian.
[00:15:00.449 --> 00:15:01.290]  I mean, as a male.
[00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.452]  As a fighting age male, I'm not just meant to be a tough guy.
[00:15:04.772 --> 00:15:09.035]  I'm meant to be informed and knowledgeable and warning my fellow humans about things.
[00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:11.196]  That's the position of a healthy male.
[00:15:11.256 --> 00:15:14.198]  That's what we're supposed to do in that guardian position.
[00:15:14.618 --> 00:15:15.218]  Genetically.
[00:15:15.518 --> 00:15:16.239]  Historically.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.061]  That's through anthropology and sociology.
[00:15:20.341 --> 00:15:21.182]  That's who we are.
[00:15:21.582 --> 00:15:23.984]  So I'm there thinking about doing this and the cops come in.
[00:15:24.004 --> 00:15:26.445]  I go into total analyzing mode.
[00:15:26.945 --> 00:15:27.906]  I'm watching everything.
[00:15:27.946 --> 00:15:29.407]  I see everyone suddenly not talking.
[00:15:29.747 --> 00:15:30.568]  They're intimidated.
[00:15:31.408 --> 00:15:32.970]  And I look at these police officers.
[00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.111]  They look intimidated.
[00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:34.992]  They look upset.
[00:15:35.052 --> 00:15:36.654]  They're all being quiet while they're eating.
[00:15:36.934 --> 00:15:38.016]  They look really uptight.
[00:15:39.117 --> 00:15:40.539]  And so I decide to talk to them.
[00:15:40.579 --> 00:15:42.761]  I decide to go over and talk to the police officers.
[00:15:42.801 --> 00:15:43.282]  Four of them.
[00:15:43.662 --> 00:15:44.924]  Three males and a female.
[00:15:46.005 --> 00:15:47.447]  And I went over and talked to them.
[00:15:47.467 --> 00:15:49.769]  And I'll tell you what happened when we get back.
[00:15:49.849 --> 00:15:51.031]  And I went over and I told them.

[00:16:53.646 --> 00:16:57.869]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.469]  Number 1.
[00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.252]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:17:02.532 --> 00:17:03.092]  Number 2.
[00:17:03.393 --> 00:17:07.936]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:17:08.276 --> 00:17:08.736]  It's true.
[00:17:09.036 --> 00:17:13.579]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.440]  Number 3.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.002]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:17:18.302 --> 00:17:22.005]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:17:22.205 --> 00:17:22.766]  Number 4.
[00:17:23.006 --> 00:17:25.368]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:17:25.769 --> 00:17:29.152]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:17:29.453 --> 00:17:29.673]  Number 5.
[00:17:30.233 --> 00:17:34.158]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:17:34.398 --> 00:17:39.143]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:17:39.423 --> 00:17:43.470]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.172]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:17:53.499 --> 00:17:57.462]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:17:57.683 --> 00:18:03.728]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:18:04.088 --> 00:18:11.194]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:18:11.475 --> 00:18:16.059]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:18:25.009 --> 00:18:28.736]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:18:29.269 --> 00:18:35.430]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.451]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:46.213]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:18:46.293 --> 00:18:47.493]  Thank you.
[00:18:57.409 --> 00:18:58.290]  Tyranny is here.
[00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.192]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:19:02.212 --> 00:19:04.814]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:19:04.834 --> 00:19:10.277]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:19:10.698 --> 00:19:16.942]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:19:17.362 --> 00:19:22.903]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:19:23.343 --> 00:19:27.004]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:19:27.524 --> 00:19:31.525]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:19:31.805 --> 00:19:37.326]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:19:37.746 --> 00:19:40.706]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:42.727]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:19:43.267 --> 00:19:43.707]  It's here.

[00:20:14.767 --> 00:20:22.752]  I got up this morning at about 7 a.m., went in and fired up the laptop at the kitchen table while I was drinking hot coffee.
[00:20:24.813 --> 00:20:26.614]  And there was the drugs report.
[00:20:27.334 --> 00:20:29.575]  Never had the giant headline at the top.
[00:20:31.336 --> 00:20:33.918]  Senate Committee Passes Internet Kill Switch.
[00:20:35.419 --> 00:20:36.820]  I think?
[00:20:50.925 --> 00:20:55.349]  And it'll be a tax on alternative media to be paid to the mainstream media.
[00:20:55.449 --> 00:20:57.290]  You can't make up something that evil.
[00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:01.994]  Not only does it violate the First Amendment, but it's discriminatory and makes you fund establishment propaganda.
[00:21:02.534 --> 00:21:09.940]  And it allows the federal government to selectively or in its entirety shut the internet off completely for four months.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.063]  So we'll be covering that coming up.
[00:21:13.823 --> 00:21:19.045]  But the good news is it is finally being covered and is being picked up by newspapers everywhere.
[00:21:19.325 --> 00:21:22.846]  And I commend the Drugs Report for giving us the top link this morning.
[00:21:22.886 --> 00:21:27.387]  It's now on the right-hand side of the Drugs Report, one of the top stories in the right-hand column.
[00:21:28.207 --> 00:21:29.088]  You can read our headlines.
[00:21:29.648 --> 00:21:32.188]  Obama Internet Kill Switch Plan Approved by U.S.
[00:21:32.248 --> 00:21:32.549]  Senate.
[00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:33.789]  That's tech world.
[00:21:34.509 --> 00:21:38.132]  Here's the PrisonPlanet.com headline, Paul Joseph Watson article from Friday.
[00:21:38.753 --> 00:21:42.135]  Obama can shut down internet for four months under new emergency powers.
[00:21:42.515 --> 00:21:45.638]  Killswitch bill approved, moves to full Senate floor.
[00:21:46.599 --> 00:21:48.180]  So we're going to be going over that.
[00:21:49.561 --> 00:21:54.705]  You're not in Kansas anymore, neither am I. This is bonafide, real tyranny.
[00:21:55.666 --> 00:21:58.007]  And a lot of people say, well I don't care if we live under tyranny.
[00:21:59.108 --> 00:22:01.850]  I go along, I got my job, I go along with what the government says.
[00:22:03.624 --> 00:22:10.206]  I submit to checkpoints and corruption and naked body scanners at the airports and the taxes always going up.
[00:22:10.266 --> 00:22:11.006]  I'm going to bend over.
[00:22:11.867 --> 00:22:14.647]  Well, they know you are, and that's why they're going to hurt you real bad.
[00:22:15.448 --> 00:22:21.450]  As Thomas Jefferson said, and as history shows, the level of tyranny you will live under is the exact level you'll put up with.
[00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:22.730]  They will not stop.
[00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:28.672]  The type of individuals in power worldwide throughout history are the types that always want more power.
[00:22:28.952 --> 00:22:31.953]  If you lay down to them completely like the Russians did to Stalin,
[00:22:33.393 --> 00:22:39.174]  They'll just kill 20-30% of you for fun, because they've got a bunch of murdering control freaks that work for them.
[00:22:39.234 --> 00:22:50.356]  They're enforcers who want to dominate you, who want to rape you, who want to steal from you, who want to arrest you so they can extract fines out of you or take your farm or ranch.
[00:22:50.416 --> 00:22:53.316]  Listen, people say that cops can do no wrong in America.
[00:22:53.497 --> 00:22:54.537]  The media told us so.
[00:22:55.277 --> 00:23:01.758]  But did the Russian cops under Stalin and Lenin before him, were they bad?
[00:23:02.594 --> 00:23:05.055]  Were Hitler's police, the Gestapo, were they bad?
[00:23:05.735 --> 00:23:08.577]  Are Pol Pot's troops, were they bad?
[00:23:09.017 --> 00:23:10.858]  Was Pol Pot's police, were they oppressive?
[00:23:11.438 --> 00:23:12.498]  What about Fidel Castro?
[00:23:12.518 --> 00:23:13.659]  What about Mao Zedong?
[00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:15.160]  What about Julius Caesar?
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.740]  What about Attila the Hun?
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.101]  Oh, he had enforcers.
[00:23:19.349 --> 00:23:22.913]  The truth is, nine times out of ten, I mean, have you ever been to Latin America?
[00:23:22.933 --> 00:23:25.775]  Have you ever been to a third world country where most of the people are living homeless?
[00:23:26.476 --> 00:23:29.439]  And there's cops in black uniforms walking around on power trips.
[00:23:29.799 --> 00:23:34.364]  People that enjoy abusing people, staring down the public, staring you down if you look them in the eyes.
[00:23:35.064 --> 00:23:37.687]  Maybe beating you up and taking you to jail if you look at them wrong.
[00:23:38.167 --> 00:23:43.332]  Maybe they want your wife, maybe they're going to take you to jail and shake you down and rape your wife in the cell next to you.
[00:23:44.013 --> 00:23:50.977]  That happens all the time to dumb, chump Americans that go to Latin America, that go to Guatemala, that go to the wrong area of Mexico.
[00:23:51.578 --> 00:23:51.878]  Okay?
[00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:57.481]  So I'm here trying to keep our police from being turned into that historically.
[00:23:57.921 --> 00:23:59.862]  Why did our Founding Fathers fight the Redcoats?
[00:24:00.103 --> 00:24:01.723]  They became oppressive police.
[00:24:02.264 --> 00:24:03.845]  Have you read the Declaration of Independence?
[00:24:04.225 --> 00:24:10.509]  Read what the government was doing then and ask yourself, ask yourself, is that what's starting to happen now?
[00:24:10.529 --> 00:24:12.110]  And the answer is yes in spades.
[00:24:13.615 --> 00:24:16.637]  Let me just finish the story quickly, then we're gonna go to break and come back and get into all the news.
[00:24:17.017 --> 00:24:23.062]  And boy, I mean, just every show, I keep saying, it gets more important, more pertinent, more insane, more crazy.
[00:24:23.302 --> 00:24:24.663]  Things are moving faster and faster.
[00:24:25.443 --> 00:24:27.945]  So I met the Pokey Joes about an hour and a half ago.
[00:24:28.045 --> 00:24:30.067]  I'm eating, uh, you know, real fast.
[00:24:30.667 --> 00:24:32.148]  Everybody's talking, having a good time.
[00:24:32.368 --> 00:24:33.209]  Families are in there.
[00:24:33.509 --> 00:24:34.710]  Cops come in, four of them.
[00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:35.670]  Everybody gets quiet.
[00:24:36.731 --> 00:24:37.652]  Everybody stops talking.
[00:24:38.971 --> 00:24:40.593]  And I look at the cops and I analyze them.
[00:24:40.613 --> 00:24:43.436]  They look like hard-working, smart, good people.
[00:24:43.836 --> 00:24:47.339]  They look like salt of the earth, good-looking, you know, people.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.761]  I got a good vibe off of them.
[00:24:49.562 --> 00:24:51.263]  They look like they were insecure.
[00:24:51.404 --> 00:24:53.185]  They look like they were hardly talking.
[00:24:54.567 --> 00:24:55.428]  They looked humble.
[00:24:56.721 --> 00:24:58.763]  Now you see a thug steroid head cop.
[00:24:59.403 --> 00:25:02.486]  People I'd see 10 years ago as bouncers now are cops downtown.
[00:25:02.526 --> 00:25:03.707]  I won't go down there because of it.
[00:25:03.987 --> 00:25:07.690]  And you can see the power trip, the craziness, the thuggishness.
[00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:11.133]  You can see somebody who's a thug cop real fast.
[00:25:11.353 --> 00:25:13.115]  You go to New York City, about half of them are.
[00:25:13.335 --> 00:25:14.116]  I mean, it's scary.
[00:25:15.457 --> 00:25:17.939]  You can go to Chicago, and the cops are scary.
[00:25:17.959 --> 00:25:28.326]  I mean, you can sit around and watch them, and you see the news footage all the time where they see a good-looking woman, they just beat her up, or somebody talks back to them when they're even off-duty, and they don't get a free beer, they beat them up.
[00:25:28.386 --> 00:25:29.466]  I mean, they're crazy thugs.
[00:25:30.127 --> 00:25:38.993]  I'm here fighting so that doesn't happen in other parts of the nation, and so we can take back places that are run by big-city mafia like Chicago and New York.
[00:25:40.291 --> 00:25:40.812]  And L.A.
[00:25:40.832 --> 00:25:43.034]  to a certain extent, but I haven't had problems in L.A.
[00:25:43.074 --> 00:25:46.798]  I've actually had cops come up everywhere and say they're listeners, but whatever.
[00:25:46.858 --> 00:25:48.920]  The issue is, police have a tough job.
[00:25:50.066 --> 00:26:01.168]  So I'm sitting there with all these government documents, because I'm sitting there writing a voiceover by hand, because I'm going to come in tonight, and after the show, I'm going to write a voiceover that was handwriting notes off government documents.
[00:26:01.608 --> 00:26:04.808]  Full spectrum dominance, soft kill weapons.
[00:26:05.329 --> 00:26:07.809]  I'm reading these Pentagon documents by Colonel Alexander.
[00:26:07.869 --> 00:26:08.769]  It's freaking me out.
[00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:10.749]  I'm looking at these families with kids.
[00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:12.190]  I'm watching them drink tap water.
[00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.410]  I'm wishing I could walk over and warn them.
[00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:15.370]  I'm looking at the cops.
[00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:16.730]  They're drinking tap water.
[00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:19.391]  I want to go tell the Pokey Joe people to filter their water.
[00:26:20.051 --> 00:26:22.413]  You know, I mean, I know it's a chemical weapon.
[00:26:22.453 --> 00:26:24.214]  I've had all the EPA scientists on.
[00:26:24.274 --> 00:26:25.675]  I know the Nazis put it in the water.
[00:26:25.956 --> 00:26:31.020]  Pulitzer Prize-winning author who worked in Nuremberg wrote, Crime and Punishment, I.G.
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:31.440]  Farben.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.341]  Or I.G.
[00:26:32.381 --> 00:26:33.361]  Farben, Crime and Punishment.
[00:26:33.461 --> 00:26:35.423]  I mean, I know it's a declassified fact.
[00:26:35.963 --> 00:26:38.986]  And so all of this is happening, and I see the cops.
[00:26:40.563 --> 00:26:44.685]  And I didn't even think to record on my iPhone the audio because it was a private exchange.
[00:26:46.625 --> 00:26:49.847]  Because when I got in and told the guys the story, you know, they said, well, you should have recorded that.
[00:26:51.407 --> 00:26:52.227]  It's time for me to go.
[00:26:52.668 --> 00:27:06.153]  So I just get up and I walk over to them, just like we need to get past the comfort zone of talking to our neighbors and then talking to people at grocery store lines and then talking to people at church or at work about more than just the baseball scores, basketball scores, or the weather.
[00:27:06.393 --> 00:27:08.294]  We're taught by the media, only talk about that.
[00:27:09.614 --> 00:27:11.275]  Talk to each other like little prisoners.
[00:27:12.435 --> 00:27:17.216]  And I walk over and I say, you guys getting a little bit of air conditioning out there in the heat?
[00:27:17.236 --> 00:27:18.797]  They look like motorcycle cops.
[00:27:19.657 --> 00:27:20.337]  I wasn't sure though.
[00:27:20.377 --> 00:27:23.518]  But the point is, I go over and I talk to them.
[00:27:24.978 --> 00:27:26.759]  And I said, boy, I bet you're hot out there.
[00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:27.379]  And I said, yeah.
[00:27:27.439 --> 00:27:31.780]  And I looked at one of them who looked me in the eyes and I said, do you know about the world government?
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.961]  And he said, yeah, I know about it.
[00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:34.481]  Because now it's all over the news.
[00:27:35.422 --> 00:27:36.122]  And I said, well,
[00:27:37.512 --> 00:27:40.195]  I'm just here to warn you about the world government, what it really means.
[00:27:40.255 --> 00:27:41.156]  It means eugenics.
[00:27:41.717 --> 00:27:43.079]  And I said, you see your tap water?
[00:27:43.099 --> 00:27:44.120]  You see your iced tea?
[00:27:44.861 --> 00:27:47.604]  I said, there is a binary chemical weapon in there.
[00:27:48.305 --> 00:27:51.008]  And I said, you need to research what sodium fluoride does.
[00:27:51.088 --> 00:27:53.050]  I said, just Google sodium fluoride cancer.
[00:27:54.111 --> 00:27:54.911]  I said, please.
[00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:57.752]  And three of them were looking at me serious.
[00:27:57.872 --> 00:27:59.393]  One of them was kind of looking at me like I was crazy.
[00:27:59.413 --> 00:28:00.133]  And I said, I know.
[00:28:00.473 --> 00:28:01.293]  It sounds crazy.
[00:28:02.174 --> 00:28:04.954]  And it's so horrible, they think you won't look it up.
[00:28:05.274 --> 00:28:06.675]  But they think you're weak-minded.
[00:28:06.755 --> 00:28:07.235]  Look it up.
[00:28:07.815 --> 00:28:09.576]  And I said, you've got a choice to make.
[00:28:09.616 --> 00:28:10.476]  What side you're on.
[00:28:11.316 --> 00:28:12.717]  And there's a storm coming.
[00:28:13.517 --> 00:28:14.717]  Please search these terms.
[00:28:15.197 --> 00:28:19.579]  And I told them, full spectrum dominance, neo, modern eugenics.
[00:28:20.459 --> 00:28:25.551]  And a few other points I made, I mean I'm paraphrasing what I said to him, and I said have a good day.
[00:28:26.843 --> 00:28:28.123]  But that's normal.
[00:28:28.163 --> 00:28:32.085]  We should be all over the streets banging on our neighbors' doors going, there's poison in the water.
[00:28:32.445 --> 00:28:34.445]  The vaccines, they got cancer viruses in them.
[00:28:34.605 --> 00:28:35.646]  Here's mainstream news.
[00:28:36.426 --> 00:28:40.987]  Look, the insert of this vaccine says it causes sterilization and brain damage.
[00:28:41.388 --> 00:28:44.088]  You know, we should be out there everywhere.
[00:28:44.148 --> 00:28:45.909]  This is the normal response.
[00:28:46.829 --> 00:28:50.790]  We should be out there exposing the central banks and how they're engineering this collapse.
[00:28:51.831 --> 00:28:52.351]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:55.017 --> 00:28:58.841]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[00:29:55.114 --> 00:29:57.717]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:29:58.137 --> 00:30:03.082]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:03.462 --> 00:30:05.184]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:05.504 --> 00:30:10.329]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:11.470]  How much do you want?
[00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:12.431]  When do you want it?
[00:30:12.812 --> 00:30:14.413]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:14.713 --> 00:30:15.534]  When will you need it?
[00:30:15.775 --> 00:30:17.837]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:17.997 --> 00:30:18.978]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:19.298 --> 00:30:23.200]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[00:30:23.361 --> 00:30:25.902]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:26.082 --> 00:30:29.264]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:29.685 --> 00:30:33.187]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:33.507 --> 00:30:34.488]  How much will you need?
[00:30:34.728 --> 00:30:35.328]  We don't know.
[00:30:35.628 --> 00:30:36.549]  How much do you want?
[00:30:36.729 --> 00:30:37.449]  All you can get.
[00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:38.350]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.770]  I think so.
[00:30:55.387 --> 00:31:01.131]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[00:31:01.851 --> 00:31:06.274]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.

[00:31:53.749 --> 00:31:57.972]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:58.292 --> 00:31:58.892]  Number 1.
[00:31:59.212 --> 00:32:02.354]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:02.635 --> 00:32:03.195]  Number 2.
[00:32:03.495 --> 00:32:08.038]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:08.378 --> 00:32:08.819]  It's true.
[00:32:09.119 --> 00:32:13.682]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:14.002 --> 00:32:14.542]  Number 3.
[00:32:14.822 --> 00:32:18.104]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:18.405 --> 00:32:22.107]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:22.868]  Number 4.
[00:32:23.108 --> 00:32:25.470]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:25.871 --> 00:32:29.254]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:29.555 --> 00:32:29.775]  Number 5.
[00:32:30.335 --> 00:32:34.260]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:39.245]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:39.525 --> 00:32:43.567]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:32:50.349 --> 00:32:55.951]  Coast to Coast.
[00:32:56.312 --> 00:32:57.752]  Direct from Austin.
[00:32:58.352 --> 00:33:01.574]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:24.916]  For example, I walk out there during the break and I said, search engine the term, bone cancer fluoride, or fluoride bone cancer.
[00:33:25.236 --> 00:33:30.580]  WebMD, Fox News, London Guardian, Associated Press, hundreds of studies.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.701]  They knew back in the 30s.
[00:33:32.702 --> 00:33:35.784]  And the Soviets, there's Fox News, there's London Guardian.
[00:33:38.453 --> 00:33:41.194]  Articles on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:33:42.034 --> 00:33:43.354]  Anyone can go search this.
[00:33:44.594 --> 00:33:46.955]  And this is the type of information that I'm aware of.
[00:33:47.515 --> 00:34:03.339]  And I have to sit here and walk up to a group of cops and tell them that they're drinking poison and I'm the kook, I'm the weirdo, I'm the strange one that I'm warning people when I know the Soviets by the thirties were putting it in labor camp slaves
[00:34:04.319 --> 00:34:07.103]  Water, Alexander Schultz and Nielsen has talked about this.
[00:34:07.243 --> 00:34:09.947]  I know, Pulitzer Prize winning author wrote a book.
[00:34:10.287 --> 00:34:12.830]  They worked in the Nuremberg trials as a prosecutor.
[00:34:13.591 --> 00:34:15.454]  And saw it in the Nazi documents.
[00:34:15.894 --> 00:34:20.801]  And IG Farben, that's based in the US and Germany, helped them do it.
[00:34:22.912 --> 00:34:32.737]  I mean, I know for a fact they're putting fluoride in the water to reduce your fertility, to reduce your testosterone, to attack all your organs, and to shut down your thyroid.
[00:34:32.977 --> 00:34:34.297]  And look at thyroid disorders.
[00:34:34.317 --> 00:34:35.178]  They're off the charts.
[00:34:37.285 --> 00:34:41.347]  It causes massive lowered levels of sperm count.
[00:34:41.867 --> 00:34:46.890]  It makes high levels of the sperm be deformed and not have fully formed tails, so they can't swim.
[00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:57.715]  And, you know, I've got literally dozens and dozens of government textbooks financed by taxpayers, like this one written by the White House Science Czar, John P. Holdren.
[00:34:57.735 --> 00:34:59.416]  This book costs over a hundred bucks.
[00:35:00.076 --> 00:35:03.898]  Eleven hundred pages, all about how to put stuff in the water to sterilize your butt.
[00:35:05.049 --> 00:35:14.061]  I mean, you're living in a scientific dictatorship, and I'm the kook, but you can find out that I'm not lying to you about fluoride and bone cancer in ten seconds.
[00:35:16.212 --> 00:35:20.955]  Some studies show it quadruples in boys, other studies that if it's one part per million, it doubles.
[00:35:21.235 --> 00:35:23.317]  I mean, I'm going to send this off to have it tested.
[00:35:23.917 --> 00:35:30.281]  It's going to cost us a lot of money, but I'm going to send it to a lab, and I'm going to have a bunch of different brands of baby water.
[00:35:30.301 --> 00:35:38.246]  This is what they give people, and every major water brand has it, and this is what they tell mothers to mix.
[00:35:39.246 --> 00:35:52.587]  with their baby formula or to mix with baby cereal with fluoride not sterile uses directed by a physician or labeling directions for use on infant formula purified water this is H-E-B brand
[00:35:53.502 --> 00:35:55.823]  And H-E-B isn't involved in the eugenics operation.
[00:35:55.843 --> 00:35:57.264]  They're just told this is what you do.
[00:35:57.344 --> 00:36:07.808]  Really, six years ago, the American Dental Association said children under six should not drink fluoridated water or brush their teeth with it because it causes dental fluorosis and weakening of the teeth.
[00:36:08.188 --> 00:36:09.228]  My dad's a dentist, folks.
[00:36:09.588 --> 00:36:10.489]  I know this, okay?
[00:36:10.769 --> 00:36:12.950]  You could find out in 30 seconds by searching
[00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:18.012]  American Dental Association says children under the age of six should not ingest fluoride.
[00:36:18.492 --> 00:36:22.193]  Well, that's calcium fluoride that you do need some of for your teeth.
[00:36:22.554 --> 00:36:25.735]  This is sodium fluoride, what they put in your water.
[00:36:25.955 --> 00:36:28.636]  And ladies and gentlemen, I drank some of this this week.
[00:36:28.676 --> 00:36:30.357]  I took a drink of this and...
[00:36:31.479 --> 00:36:35.300]  You know, after you've been drinking real purified water, it's totally different than drinking tap water.
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:39.101]  I look at this water, it's got, I mean, it literally has got stuff floating around in it.
[00:36:39.762 --> 00:36:43.503]  And here's Ozarka brand spring fluoride for children.
[00:36:43.543 --> 00:36:45.564]  Let's show presentplanet.tv viewers that.
[00:36:46.424 --> 00:36:48.504]  Spring water with added fluoride.
[00:36:48.865 --> 00:36:49.645]  Yum, yum.
[00:36:50.205 --> 00:36:50.966]  How good.
[00:36:50.986 --> 00:36:52.306]  A little smiley face.
[00:36:52.346 --> 00:36:56.689]  And my son said he went to camp and he said almost all the kids were sitting there drinking.
[00:36:56.709 --> 00:37:07.196]  And he came home and he said, Dad, I saw bottles that had a smiley face saying spring water with added fluoride and that the teacher told him he was basically a kook at camp because he didn't have it in his lunchbox.
[00:37:07.996 --> 00:37:15.541]  My little seven-year-old son, smarter and more informed about what's going on in the world than full-grown adults.
[00:37:16.903 --> 00:37:25.585]  But I mean, who would believe that we're told to put this in our water when it is a sterilant and causes brain damage on record?
[00:37:25.825 --> 00:37:29.286]  But see, people can't deal with a horror that incredible.
[00:37:29.406 --> 00:37:30.326]  And that's just one of them.
[00:37:30.666 --> 00:37:38.168]  All the studies show every major GMO crop sterilizes in the first generation around half of the animals that are fed it.
[00:37:38.228 --> 00:37:41.349]  Guinea pigs, rats, mice, you name it, monkeys.
[00:37:44.116 --> 00:37:57.500]  By the third generation, in all these major studies, you end up with almost complete, almost 98-99% sterilization, deformities, five times the morbidity, meaning animals live one-fifth as long.
[00:37:58.601 --> 00:38:00.361]  I mean, this is in the news every day.
[00:38:00.561 --> 00:38:01.782]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[00:38:01.802 --> 00:38:06.403]  They even put it out there, oh, Danid, fluoride on the go for your kids.
[00:38:06.963 --> 00:38:08.344]  Great for kids on the go.
[00:38:08.364 --> 00:38:12.285]  And they've got other brands that have a big school bus on the side.
[00:38:13.988 --> 00:38:18.352]  This water, ladies and gentlemen, literally tastes like crud.
[00:38:18.732 --> 00:38:20.033]  I'm gonna drink some on air right now.
[00:38:21.134 --> 00:38:23.857]  No weapon formed against us, so prosper as the Bible says.
[00:38:24.577 --> 00:38:26.439]  But it's a cumulative poison.
[00:38:26.699 --> 00:38:34.165]  Almost all the fluoride you drink precipitates out on your organs, particularly your thyroid, your pancreas, your liver, your bones.
[00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:37.709]  I mean, man.
[00:38:38.289 --> 00:38:39.290]  I mean, you can taste that.
[00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:40.511]  I'll guarantee it.
[00:38:40.531 --> 00:38:41.312]  We're sending this off.
[00:38:42.312 --> 00:38:43.213]  We're looking at different labs.
[00:38:43.273 --> 00:38:44.173]  It's very expensive.
[00:38:44.673 --> 00:39:00.522]  I'm going to send this off, this water, to have how many parts per million it is, because the government says they want one part per million, which in major studies causes upwards of a 10-point IQ to 20-point IQ reduction, depending on the study or age group in children.
[00:39:01.983 --> 00:39:07.046]  And ladies and gentlemen, this taste, whatever's in it, I mean, it is strong.
[00:39:08.683 --> 00:39:16.407]  And we've boiled down different bottled water sediments here at the office, in there on the stove, just to, you know, do a basic study on how much sediment's in it.
[00:39:16.688 --> 00:39:18.409]  And these bottled waters, it's just incredible.
[00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:20.290]  All of them, Ozarka, you name it.
[00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:21.710]  Drink another drink of this.
[00:39:24.712 --> 00:39:28.334]  Man, this is what's being given to babies all day long, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:29.395 --> 00:39:29.795]  Imagine.
[00:39:29.995 --> 00:39:34.178]  And the American Medical Association, American Dental Association, says kids don't even need this.
[00:39:35.285 --> 00:39:37.086]  That it causes dental fluorosis.
[00:39:37.447 --> 00:39:38.448]  That is a fact!
[00:39:38.888 --> 00:39:41.250]  But they market it and these mothers give it to their children.
[00:39:42.691 --> 00:39:44.973]  There's your dental fluorosis if you're watching on Prison Planet.
[00:39:47.571 --> 00:39:48.372]  We're good to go.
[00:40:08.466 --> 00:40:11.267]  And sodium fluoride with a skull and crossbones.
[00:40:11.307 --> 00:40:15.629]  If you go to the water treatment plant and get a tur, the bags of it have big, giant skull and crossbones.
[00:40:15.649 --> 00:40:19.971]  And it says, if you ingest a gram of this, you're going to have organ failure.
[00:40:20.891 --> 00:40:21.791]  But they put it in your water.
[00:40:22.452 --> 00:40:23.032]  Look right here.
[00:40:23.632 --> 00:40:24.132]  Colgate.
[00:40:24.432 --> 00:40:24.572]  Mmm.
[00:40:25.873 --> 00:40:28.514]  And it says if you ingest more than a pea-sized amount,
[00:40:31.581 --> 00:40:32.321]  Oh, there's CBS.
[00:40:32.381 --> 00:40:33.921]  Too much fluoride can ruin the bones.
[00:40:34.282 --> 00:40:37.002]  Oh yeah, all over Australia, all over the U.S., they'll have droughts.
[00:40:37.062 --> 00:40:39.343]  This is what's really proven to ranchers and farmers.
[00:40:40.323 --> 00:40:42.783]  They'll have droughts in Australia, the United States, Canada.
[00:40:42.803 --> 00:40:44.004]  It always comes out in local news.
[00:40:44.524 --> 00:40:56.466]  The farmers go, well, because the river dried up, or because the pond dried up, we were giving them municipal water here at the feedlot, and within a few months, all their hair fell out, and my cows, my horses.
[00:40:57.286 --> 00:40:59.187]  In Australia, they were raising kangaroos.
[00:40:59.227 --> 00:40:59.727]  They died.
[00:41:00.734 --> 00:41:08.276]  I mean, you give sodium fluoride municipal water, you put a goldfish in municipal water, it rolls over within a day and dies.
[00:41:09.577 --> 00:41:14.859]  I mean, take a fish tank, pour some water in it, you'll get cruelty to animals charges on you.
[00:41:15.119 --> 00:41:17.079]  You can't put that fish in Florida, it'll kill it!
[00:41:17.819 --> 00:41:19.240]  But wait, my kids are supposed to drink it.
[00:41:22.779 --> 00:41:43.228]  Oh, it just came out, the Times of India, most prestigious, one of the oldest newspapers in India, a long-term government study finding massive retardation, reduced fertility and bone disease because of the fluoride, because the IMF World Bank recommends five parts per million in India, because they think they can get away with killing these people right out in the open.
[00:41:43.428 --> 00:41:47.490]  Here in America, you get one part per million, because you might notice how much it's hurting you.
[00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:51.431]  Now, how am I not supposed to, in a restaurant, walk up and warn people?
[00:41:51.871 --> 00:41:58.493]  And everybody's scared of the cops, everybody gets quiet when they come in and sit down at the Pokey Joe's, so I get up and I walk over and I tell them.
[00:41:59.773 --> 00:42:04.415]  And the good news is they were not looking at me like I was a complete lunatic, because enough of this has now come out.
[00:42:05.555 --> 00:42:07.456]  First I said, oh, you came in here to get out of the heat.
[00:42:07.596 --> 00:42:08.536]  Little friendly thing.
[00:42:09.876 --> 00:42:11.797]  Hey, do you know about the world government?
[00:42:12.377 --> 00:42:13.417]  They said, yeah, I know about it.
[00:42:14.158 --> 00:42:15.138]  Because now it's out in the open.
[00:42:17.222 --> 00:42:20.024]  And I said, well, do you know about the chemical weapon in your drink right there?
[00:42:21.485 --> 00:42:25.088]  And I looked at them real serious, because they... It doesn't even matter.
[00:42:25.128 --> 00:42:26.249]  Why do I even do this show?
[00:42:26.749 --> 00:42:29.431]  Look, folks, I can't do everything for you, okay?
[00:42:29.691 --> 00:42:30.292]  It's real!
[00:42:31.813 --> 00:42:36.796]  If you ate a teaspoon of this Colgate, you would get sicker than a dog, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:36.856 --> 00:42:38.457]  This is a chemical weapon.
[00:42:38.878 --> 00:42:39.538]  It's a fact.
[00:42:39.638 --> 00:42:40.659]  The Nazis used it.
[00:42:40.899 --> 00:42:41.920]  The Soviets used it.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:42.801]  I'm warning you.
[00:42:43.101 --> 00:42:43.961]  I care about you.
[00:42:44.041 --> 00:42:45.603]  I care about my fellow man.
[00:42:46.863 --> 00:42:52.388]  I don't have death and hatred for mankind like the globalists, the eugenicists, who openly want to reduce world population.
[00:42:53.969 --> 00:42:55.590]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:58.433]  You've heard me talk about Kalben 5 Star Soaps for years.

[00:43:15.287 --> 00:43:17.629]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.

[00:43:24.455 --> 00:43:25.857]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:43:47.323 --> 00:43:47.763]  Thank you!
[00:43:53.641 --> 00:43:55.923]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:43:55.943 --> 00:43:58.245]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:43:58.345 --> 00:44:01.127]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:44:01.567 --> 00:44:06.331]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:44:06.652 --> 00:44:10.855]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:44:11.175 --> 00:44:13.519]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:44:13.639 --> 00:44:16.043]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:44:16.063 --> 00:44:18.967]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:44:19.327 --> 00:44:26.919]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:44:27.256 --> 00:44:32.539]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:44:32.639 --> 00:44:35.440]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.922]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:44:39.182 --> 00:44:40.102]  And I got news for you.
[00:44:40.242 --> 00:44:41.563]  You're everyone else.
[00:44:41.583 --> 00:44:42.563]  Invisible Empire.

[00:44:54.226 --> 00:44:56.827]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:44:57.247 --> 00:45:02.189]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:45:02.569 --> 00:45:04.289]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:09.431]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:45:09.611 --> 00:45:10.572]  How much do you want?
[00:45:10.792 --> 00:45:11.532]  When do you want it?
[00:45:11.912 --> 00:45:13.513]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:45:13.793 --> 00:45:14.614]  When will you need it?
[00:45:14.874 --> 00:45:16.935]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:45:17.075 --> 00:45:18.176]  Will there be any food?
[00:45:18.416 --> 00:45:19.737]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:45:19.937 --> 00:45:25.001]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:45:25.201 --> 00:45:28.343]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:45:28.783 --> 00:45:32.284]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:45:32.604 --> 00:45:33.584]  How much will you need?
[00:45:33.825 --> 00:45:34.445]  We don't know.
[00:45:34.745 --> 00:45:35.645]  How much do you want?
[00:45:35.845 --> 00:45:36.565]  All you can get.
[00:45:36.765 --> 00:45:37.606]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:45:37.866 --> 00:45:40.626]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:45:40.907 --> 00:45:43.107]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:45:43.147 --> 00:45:44.127]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:45:53.342 --> 00:45:58.225]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:45:58.345 --> 00:45:59.106]  What have we got?
[00:45:59.326 --> 00:46:01.447]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:46:01.767 --> 00:46:02.488]  A republic.
[00:46:02.768 --> 00:46:05.349]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:46:05.409 --> 00:46:07.331]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:46:07.671 --> 00:46:09.592]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:46:09.712 --> 00:46:10.993]  So they think they own our land?
[00:46:11.393 --> 00:46:12.514]  They think they own our water?
[00:46:12.714 --> 00:46:13.114]  Children?
[00:46:13.314 --> 00:46:14.115]  Our education?
[00:46:14.435 --> 00:46:15.035]  Our money?
[00:46:15.256 --> 00:46:18.918]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:46:19.278 --> 00:46:23.944]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:46:24.244 --> 00:46:25.065]  We have the facts.
[00:46:25.285 --> 00:46:26.386]  We have the Constitution.
[00:46:26.446 --> 00:46:27.328]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:46:27.348 --> 00:46:28.189]  We have common law.
[00:46:28.249 --> 00:46:30.491]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:30.752 --> 00:46:34.536]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:46:34.636 --> 00:46:39.420]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.962]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:46:41.082 --> 00:46:41.922]  Don't tread on me.
[00:46:42.183 --> 00:46:49.049]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:46:54.847 --> 00:46:57.709]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:46:58.429 --> 00:47:02.531]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:14.317 --> 00:47:22.341]  On screen right now for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers is a can of Sweeney's Roach Poison from the 1950s.
[00:47:24.588 --> 00:47:25.689]  Out of Missouri.
[00:47:27.671 --> 00:47:29.713]  And you can get modern rat poison.
[00:47:29.793 --> 00:47:33.776]  Sodium fluoride kills roaches, water bugs, crickets, silverfish.
[00:47:34.357 --> 00:47:37.339]  Just a powder you put out, 40% sodium fluoride.
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:39.681]  Dead, dead, dead.
[00:47:39.721 --> 00:47:42.644]  And of course, everyone who works at water treatment plants knows this.
[00:47:42.744 --> 00:47:44.085]  I have family in East Texas.
[00:47:45.166 --> 00:47:56.313]  Uh, who, well, one of them runs the water treatment plant in a small town, and they know full well, they're told to buy it by the city council, it comes in from China, and they use it as bug poison for fire ants.
[00:47:56.753 --> 00:48:01.536]  You put a teaspoon of that on a fire ant bed, and they just walk through it, they're dead!
[00:48:01.616 --> 00:48:02.476]  Nothing stops it!
[00:48:02.757 --> 00:48:03.897]  It's so deadly!
[00:48:05.798 --> 00:48:07.579]  But your children are drinking it!
[00:48:07.819 --> 00:48:13.263]  And I have to sit here and be the conspiracy theorist kook, when all I'm doing is showing you facts!
[00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:15.145]  Show it again.
[00:48:15.205 --> 00:48:16.646]  Put it back up on screen right there.
[00:48:18.548 --> 00:48:22.090]  Now, the little scientist, the little egghead eugenicist.
[00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:27.674]  You notice you see in sitcoms and dramas and in mainstream news, maybe we should only have one child in America.
[00:48:27.714 --> 00:48:29.074]  Maybe we should have no children.
[00:48:29.315 --> 00:48:32.417]  New York Times last week headlined, The Last Generation.
[00:48:34.118 --> 00:48:38.340]  Written by the eugenicist, Dr. Peter Singer, telling you having children, period, is bad.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.462]  There needs to be taxes on having children.
[00:48:43.356 --> 00:48:45.058]  This is what everything is about.
[00:48:45.418 --> 00:48:47.700]  Now you may like having your fertility lowered.
[00:48:48.141 --> 00:48:49.702]  You may like getting bone cancer.
[00:48:49.762 --> 00:48:52.905]  You may like getting thyroid malfunction.
[00:48:53.746 --> 00:48:54.527]  Now epidemic.
[00:48:54.647 --> 00:48:58.230]  You may like your pancreas burning out, associated with sodium fluoride.
[00:48:58.270 --> 00:48:59.391]  You may like diabetes.
[00:48:59.892 --> 00:49:00.732]  I don't like it.
[00:49:01.193 --> 00:49:02.414]  And I don't want it in my water.
[00:49:02.494 --> 00:49:03.235]  Because here's the new deal.
[00:49:03.495 --> 00:49:04.216]  Four years ago,
[00:49:04.716 --> 00:49:09.698]  The federal government approved fluoride as a poison on crops.
[00:49:09.758 --> 00:49:19.222]  It's now being used as a pesticide, and it's such a small particulate, it goes right through the plant membrane, right through the cell wall, and precipitates into the plant.
[00:49:20.222 --> 00:49:22.023]  So see, there's no... In fact, people won't believe that.
[00:49:22.123 --> 00:49:23.304]  Search engine the term right now.
[00:49:24.764 --> 00:49:31.847]  EPA authorizes fluoride to be sprayed on crops, and now it's being sprayed nationwide as a poison.
[00:49:32.627 --> 00:49:33.428]  As a poison!
[00:49:34.445 --> 00:49:38.151]  Let me tell you something, you spray sodium fluoride on those crops and a bug takes one bite?
[00:49:38.531 --> 00:49:38.992]  Dead!
[00:49:39.773 --> 00:49:40.274]  Dead!
[00:49:41.136 --> 00:49:46.584]  And then it precipitates into the soil and the plants, if you didn't know this, pull up heavy metals, pull up toxins.
[00:49:47.657 --> 00:49:52.580]  Why do you think half of corn syrup products, Washington Post reported, full of mercury?
[00:49:53.161 --> 00:50:07.370]  Because they're dumping mercury in the fertilizer on the crops, because the fertilizer is the byproduct of the oil industry, and they use mercury and they use sodium fluoride in the cracking of the oil, and it's also a byproduct of the oil.
[00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:08.491]  It's so toxic.
[00:50:08.691 --> 00:50:12.073]  And they dump it on our food crops, and it's a big joke to the elite.
[00:50:12.334 --> 00:50:14.255]  You're being poisoned by design.
[00:50:14.475 --> 00:50:17.217]  The public isn't just dumbed down because of TV and culture.
[00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:19.992]  The public is brain damaged.
[00:50:20.053 --> 00:50:22.236]  In fact, I saw a study just last week, major government study.
[00:50:22.617 --> 00:50:25.461]  IQs are down for some reason all over Western Europe and the United States.
[00:50:26.303 --> 00:50:29.187]  Not test scores, not laziness is up.
[00:50:31.092 --> 00:50:31.292]  No.
[00:50:31.712 --> 00:50:33.453]  Actual IQs are down.
[00:50:33.493 --> 00:50:34.173]  We're dumb.
[00:50:34.433 --> 00:50:35.113]  Put that back up.
[00:50:35.153 --> 00:50:37.114]  No, that's live virus spray on meats.
[00:50:37.594 --> 00:50:39.834]  Viral meat spray advancing food safety.
[00:50:40.795 --> 00:50:45.896]  At about 2,000 to 3,000 times the level of what those normal viruses are.
[00:50:45.936 --> 00:50:46.976]  It's actually a vaccine.
[00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:48.237]  That's ABC News.
[00:50:48.277 --> 00:50:49.077]  They spray on your meat.
[00:50:49.497 --> 00:50:52.058]  And I'm not getting into radiated food, GMO.
[00:50:52.078 --> 00:50:53.318]  That's another subject, okay?
[00:50:53.778 --> 00:50:57.679]  It's guaranteed that sodium fluoride is a deadly cumulative poison.
[00:50:57.999 --> 00:50:58.780]  And it's a soft kill.
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:50:59.640]  It kills you slowly.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.683]  Arthritis, all of it's connected to it, because it precipitates out in the bones.
[00:51:03.984 --> 00:51:05.705]  The Indians are about to pull it out of their water.
[00:51:06.306 --> 00:51:17.476]  And a search engine, EPA approves, it was FDA too, but EPA approves fluoride to be put on crops.
[00:51:17.937 --> 00:51:18.798]  I want them to see that.
[00:51:19.318 --> 00:51:21.060]  It was four years ago, but it'll come up.
[00:51:23.135 --> 00:51:29.356]  You know, I didn't even take calls really last week to the last two segments, and I don't even know what I'm going to do today, because I haven't even gotten into the news.
[00:51:29.776 --> 00:51:40.798]  I just get into one subject like fluoride, and I'm going to sit here and talk about it, I think, the rest of the show, and just show you mainstream news, documents, the periodic chart, you know, all the facts.
[00:51:41.799 --> 00:51:42.999]  How many scientists have I had on?
[00:51:43.039 --> 00:51:44.579]  How many brain surgeons to tell you this?
[00:51:44.979 --> 00:51:49.060]  I mean, how many government documents do I have to show you where they're bragging about what they're doing to you?
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:54.163]  I could play Fox News with the government proposing putting lithium in the water to make us behave ourselves.
[00:51:55.704 --> 00:51:59.507]  I guess they've conquered Afghanistan to get lithium, not for batteries, but to spike your water.
[00:51:59.887 --> 00:52:02.569]  A dangerous, heavy metal, toxic chemical.
[00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:05.190]  An anti-psychotic.
[00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:06.992]  And the Japanese and U.S.
[00:52:07.032 --> 00:52:16.278]  government are openly floating the balloon thinking you're so dumb already on so many other drugs they put in your water and food that they can talk about lithium in your hind end.
[00:52:17.932 --> 00:52:18.973]  Is that funny, police?
[00:52:18.993 --> 00:52:25.637]  You like somebody sticking nerve poison, an excitotoxin, in your water?
[00:52:25.677 --> 00:52:26.297]  You like that?
[00:52:26.618 --> 00:52:29.620]  You think it's funny when somebody walks up and warns you about it in a restaurant?
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:32.401]  Is that how brain damaged and brainwashed you are?
[00:52:32.682 --> 00:52:34.163]  What about the rest of you out there?
[00:52:34.823 --> 00:52:36.504]  The truth is, I'm the one that sees straight.
[00:52:36.664 --> 00:52:38.225]  The truth is, I'm the one that's red-blooded.
[00:52:38.405 --> 00:52:40.907]  The truth is, I'm the one that's not under mind control.
[00:52:42.188 --> 00:52:43.869]  Now let me tell you what else I warned you about.
[00:52:47.031 --> 00:52:48.592]  Here's Tech World today.
[00:52:48.732 --> 00:52:52.015]  Obama Internet Kill Switch plans approved by U.S.
[00:52:52.796 --> 00:52:53.076]  Senate.
[00:52:53.376 --> 00:52:54.697]  Up on Drudge Report right now.
[00:52:56.339 --> 00:52:58.921]  And it says that the government can totally take the web over for any reason.
[00:52:59.281 --> 00:53:04.606]  It creates these high school initiatives with these giant government cybersecurity branches of people spying.
[00:53:05.687 --> 00:53:13.653]  It integrates with the FCC, putting black boxes in all our homes and in ISPs, tracking everything we look at on the web and blocking whatever they feel like.
[00:53:13.974 --> 00:53:15.095]  Worse than Communist China.
[00:53:16.499 --> 00:53:20.421]  Drudge also linked to this is his top story this morning from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:53:20.881 --> 00:53:26.243]  Obama can shut down internet for four months under new emergency powers before Congress even looks at it.
[00:53:26.623 --> 00:53:30.604]  I mean, you talk about red level, folks, you can't, I can't even believe this is happening.
[00:53:31.085 --> 00:53:40.188]  I cannot believe my country, it's one thing to know this is all happening and it's being planned, but it's another thing to see it actually being enforced.
[00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:44.190]  And again, Obama is going to shut the internet off
[00:53:45.188 --> 00:53:49.673]  And other presidents, during little emergencies, they stage, Oh look, Al-Qaeda hit the web!
[00:53:50.013 --> 00:53:54.078]  But we were able to shut the web off for a few days, and then that sets the precedent that it's okay.
[00:53:54.418 --> 00:53:55.159]  That's how they do it.
[00:53:56.821 --> 00:54:01.486]  It's gonna be the same thing with their FEMA camps, their emergencies, how they're talking about evacuations in the Gulf.
[00:54:01.826 --> 00:54:03.989]  It just sets all these unconstitutional parameters.
[00:54:10.299 --> 00:54:13.942]  It's now come out that Elena Kagan was involved with that Alabama governor.
[00:54:14.843 --> 00:54:18.245]  And it came out that he was completely innocent and they had to release him from prison.
[00:54:18.846 --> 00:54:23.129]  And that Bush and Karl Rove had sent him to prison for political reasons and they just set it up.
[00:54:23.449 --> 00:54:26.111]  And it turns out she was one of the people instrumental in helping it happen.
[00:54:26.131 --> 00:54:29.414]  I mean, that's the kind of monsters that we're talking about here.
[00:54:29.434 --> 00:54:32.336]  I mean, look at this.
[00:54:32.717 --> 00:54:33.858]  Look at this article right here.
[00:54:34.338 --> 00:54:36.600]  Lieberman, Bill would strip citizenship
[00:54:37.751 --> 00:54:42.993]  of citizens allow secret indefinite attention for any reason including intelligence gathering.
[00:54:43.253 --> 00:54:45.114]  That bill is set to pass the U.S.
[00:54:45.154 --> 00:54:45.434]  Senate.
[00:54:46.234 --> 00:54:46.775]  Here's another one.
[00:54:47.075 --> 00:54:49.316]  New bill gives Obama kill switch to shut down the internet.
[00:54:49.576 --> 00:54:50.636]  Again, dovetailing with that.
[00:54:51.797 --> 00:54:52.517]  Look at Canada.
[00:54:52.957 --> 00:54:55.878]  G20 law gives police sweeping powers to arrest people.
[00:54:56.759 --> 00:55:01.361]  And reporters we know and have interviewed were just arrested for just being there on the street.
[00:55:01.641 --> 00:55:02.541]  Cops would walk over.
[00:55:03.061 --> 00:55:05.282]  In fact, I have one of the headlines here.
[00:55:05.302 --> 00:55:06.863]  Let me find it.
[00:55:07.952 --> 00:55:08.753]  I covered it Friday.
[00:55:09.133 --> 00:55:09.493]  Here it is.
[00:55:09.574 --> 00:55:13.277]  Secret law lets police arrest people for no reason.
[00:55:13.617 --> 00:55:14.898]  That's out of the Ottawa Citizen.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:17.941]  But that's the issue.
[00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:24.347]  I mean, I took my kids to the Paramount yesterday with my parents to see the old Errol Flynn Robin Hood.
[00:55:24.627 --> 00:55:27.530]  Good, clean, old-fashioned movie about standing up against tyranny.
[00:55:29.232 --> 00:55:32.495]  And the over-taxation, the corruption, you know, based on true legends.
[00:55:39.195 --> 00:55:49.441]  You've got the brother of the king, while the king's been basically held ransom in Europe, and he just says, take him away, take him away and execute him.
[00:55:49.702 --> 00:55:51.823]  No judge, no jury, just take him away.
[00:55:52.823 --> 00:56:07.573]  The movie starts with him having to swear out fake death sentences for people, but by the end it's just kill whoever, kill, no death sentence, no nothing, no formality, just kill, just take them away, just take him away.
[00:56:08.649 --> 00:56:09.589]  That's going on in Europe.
[00:56:09.629 --> 00:56:10.489]  That's going on here.
[00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:12.770]  Here's another one from Salon.
[00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:16.811]  How many Americans are targeted for assassination?
[00:56:17.231 --> 00:56:25.073]  And the article goes through how a few years ago they said, well, we'll kill Americans if the Pentagon says they're working with Taliban or Al-Qaeda overseas.
[00:56:25.533 --> 00:56:30.735]  And now they just, with small little changes, said, we'll kill whoever we want, anytime.
[00:56:30.995 --> 00:56:32.535]  We'll send in black ops squads.
[00:56:32.835 --> 00:56:34.556]  We'll send in private contractors.
[00:56:35.765 --> 00:56:40.691]  We'll kill any American citizen anywhere we want, and the Israelis can come in America and kill U.S.
[00:56:40.711 --> 00:56:41.652]  citizens whenever they want.
[00:56:41.972 --> 00:56:48.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, when they get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution, when they get rid of the Declaration of Independence, that's the shield for all of you.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.001]  That protects all of us.
[00:56:50.908 --> 00:56:53.629]  They want tyranny so they can take all your pension funds.
[00:56:53.949 --> 00:57:00.732]  They want tyranny so they can conscript your children to be imperial stormtroopers in a global army to have their arms and legs blown off.
[00:57:01.032 --> 00:57:04.873]  They want tyranny so they can secure all their ill-gotten gains.
[00:57:05.193 --> 00:57:12.416]  Tyranny will target every one of you out there listening, and all of you good old boys and yuppies, and people who think you're part of the establishment.
[00:57:12.716 --> 00:57:17.118]  You better count the cost right now and decide which side you're on, liberty or tyranny.
[00:57:17.338 --> 00:57:19.419]  You better decide whether you're going to get off the bench
[00:57:19.739 --> 00:57:28.604]  And be part of the second American revolution against tyranny to restore the republic or whether you're going to sit there and suck your thumb and let all of this come to fruition.
[00:57:29.345 --> 00:57:34.147]  We need intelligent, able-bodied men and women who understand what's going on.
[00:57:34.228 --> 00:57:39.711]  Doctors, lawyers, scientists, others, police officers to stand up and be heard now.
[00:57:39.871 --> 00:57:40.111]  Now!
[00:57:40.271 --> 00:57:40.511]  Now!
[00:57:40.751 --> 00:57:41.532]  Now is the time!

[00:58:47.852 --> 00:58:53.897]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:58:54.257 --> 00:59:01.363]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:59:01.663 --> 00:59:06.247]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:59:44.832 --> 00:59:46.013]  Coast to Coast.
[00:59:46.373 --> 00:59:47.754]  Direct from Austin.
[00:59:48.435 --> 00:59:51.638]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:59:58.868 --> 00:59:59.488]  Big Brother.
[01:00:00.189 --> 01:00:01.230]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:03.071]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:03.711 --> 01:00:04.532]  You want answers?
[01:00:05.293 --> 01:00:06.293]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.834 --> 01:00:10.456]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.037 --> 01:00:15.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.001 --> 01:00:22.085]  Well, Judge Andrew Napolitano told us Thursday that his number one Fox business show out of the gates.
[01:00:23.146 --> 01:00:32.291]  That the second show is going to air this Saturday, and that Congressman Dana Rohrabacher said that almost all Republicans think the Iraq and Afghanistan war are illegal and immoral.
[01:00:33.692 --> 01:00:36.193]  And sure enough, I watched it Saturday, and he said that and more.
[01:00:36.893 --> 01:00:38.174]  Man, how the worm turns!
[01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:50.721]  Well, Ron Paul got huge cheers whenever he, a year and a half ago at the CPAC event, said that it's not conservative to have illegal preemptive wars.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.662]  That's the most influential conservatives out there.
[01:00:54.803 --> 01:00:59.969]  Whoever said liberals had to be for open borders in a bankrupt country and for gun confiscation?
[01:01:00.369 --> 01:01:04.054]  Whoever said Republicans had to be for illegal criminal wars and torture?
[01:01:04.634 --> 01:01:06.436]  They tell you this is what you've got to be for.
[01:01:06.877 --> 01:01:08.619]  They limit the scope of debate.
[01:01:09.758 --> 01:01:12.960]  I just want to say great job to my crew that comes in every Sunday to be part of the show.
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:23.287]  We couldn't do it without Matt Ryan and Matt and of course Jaron and everybody here up here on the Sunday team who also worked during the week.
[01:01:23.887 --> 01:01:26.809]  I know I didn't take any calls in the first hour and I love to hear your calls.
[01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:34.354]  It's just that I get frustrated and feel like I don't go to enough of them or I keep you on hold or I don't let you talk long enough but then I want to get to everybody else.
[01:01:34.995 --> 01:01:39.278]  I'm going to cover a bunch of other important news on the economy and the police state and
[01:01:40.138 --> 01:01:44.541]  Now they are talking about big evacuations of tens of millions of people in the Gulf in the Washington Post.
[01:01:44.581 --> 01:01:50.505]  So we have some military sources that it looks like they are being trained for some really scary scenarios.
[01:01:50.545 --> 01:01:52.066]  So that's coming up as well.
[01:01:52.086 --> 01:01:53.186]  But let me give you the number to join us.
[01:01:53.246 --> 01:01:55.328]  It's 888-201-2244.
[01:01:55.348 --> 01:01:56.428]  888-201-2244.
[01:01:57.709 --> 01:02:01.812]  But please call in about one of the subjects I've raised or something really important.
[01:02:02.937 --> 01:02:13.308]  Because about the economy, about these wars, about how they're now saying we're going to stay in Afghanistan for a couple more years after the last deadline.
[01:02:13.328 --> 01:02:15.951]  They always play that same trick of, oh, we're leaving in 2008.
[01:02:16.051 --> 01:02:17.152]  Oh, now we're going to leave in 2010.
[01:02:17.192 --> 01:02:18.353]  Well, now we're going to leave in 2012.
[01:02:18.393 --> 01:02:19.615]  Well, now we're going to leave in 2014.
[01:02:25.021 --> 01:02:38.108]  Or sodium fluoride and how do you get out of the comfort zone and just start talking to neighbors and start calling in to talk radio and starting websites and getting past that fear because so many establishment people who think they're members of the establishment.
[01:02:38.248 --> 01:02:44.192]  If somebody's the manager at McDonald's, they think they're the establishment because they got five people under them, you know, at a midnight shift.
[01:02:44.752 --> 01:02:46.053]  Hey, I got five people under me.
[01:02:46.093 --> 01:02:49.134]  I'm making ten bucks an hour instead of six dollars an hour.
[01:02:49.194 --> 01:02:50.195]  I'm a big boss man.
[01:02:51.633 --> 01:02:59.877]  I've talked to so many people who have means, who are intelligent, who are informed, and they'll go, okay, so what if sodium fluoride's poison?
[01:02:59.917 --> 01:03:01.178]  So what if GMO food's bad?
[01:03:01.398 --> 01:03:02.439]  Yeah, there's a world government.
[01:03:02.859 --> 01:03:05.140]  But still, the media says you're a kook if you're against that.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.501]  I don't want to look like a kook.
[01:03:06.841 --> 01:03:07.961]  So you're going to lose everything.
[01:03:08.021 --> 01:03:08.882]  Lose the dollar.
[01:03:09.142 --> 01:03:10.103]  Lose your sovereignty.
[01:03:10.163 --> 01:03:11.303]  Lose your children's future.
[01:03:11.503 --> 01:03:15.665]  You're going to go along with all this because you want to look like you're a mainline person.
[01:03:16.306 --> 01:03:17.666]  Is it mainline to jump off a cliff?
[01:03:17.706 --> 01:03:19.047]  Is it mainline to go along with Hitler?
[01:03:19.627 --> 01:03:20.208]  I guess it is.
[01:03:21.394 --> 01:03:25.218]  That's why it was mainlined to have human sacrifice every day in the Aztec Kingdom a thousand years ago.
[01:03:25.678 --> 01:03:30.643]  It's totally insane, anti-human, satanic, but it's mainstream, so why not?
[01:03:30.803 --> 01:03:32.084]  When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
[01:03:35.208 --> 01:03:41.534]  You don't even control your own destiny when you just like flotsam and jetsam, just get thrown around in the waves, whichever way the wind blows you.
[01:03:42.773 --> 01:03:43.873]  You're only alive once.
[01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:45.734]  Be part of standing up for humanity.
[01:03:46.474 --> 01:03:53.375]  It shows how brainwashed these people are that so many of these yuppies now will admit everything we're talking about is true, but say, what are you going to do about it?
[01:03:53.615 --> 01:03:55.176]  They have no respect for themselves.
[01:03:55.216 --> 01:03:57.236]  Well, it doesn't matter if they want to be slaves.
[01:03:57.556 --> 01:04:04.058]  Those of you out there that do hear the calling, that have looked into this information, that know it's true, it's your job to stand up against this evil and take action.
[01:04:04.978 --> 01:04:06.478]  And it's a great honor to be part of this.
[01:04:06.498 --> 01:04:07.659]  You're only alive once.
[01:04:07.959 --> 01:04:09.579]  We're alive at such an important time.
[01:04:10.299 --> 01:04:15.101]  Every generation has gone through critical crossroads, but this is the most critical in our history.
[01:04:15.661 --> 01:04:22.282]  The very survival of our species is at stake, because the globalists aren't just seeking to dominate societies, religions, geographic areas.
[01:04:22.503 --> 01:04:30.745]  They want to dominate humanity itself and change what humanity is into a suboid, dumbed-down, servant class.
[01:04:30.785 --> 01:04:31.805]  I have their own documents.
[01:04:33.775 --> 01:04:34.796]  Infowars.com.
[01:04:34.876 --> 01:04:35.897]  Prisonplanet.com.
[01:04:37.078 --> 01:04:38.700]  Leaders in the war against the globalists.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.261]  Key junction points.
[01:04:40.401 --> 01:04:41.662]  Jump points to the next level.
[01:04:41.682 --> 01:04:42.443]  888-201-2244.
[01:04:42.463 --> 01:04:43.824]  888-201-2244.
[01:04:44.625 --> 01:04:47.467]  Your phone calls and a ton of news.
[01:04:47.848 --> 01:04:49.049]  Straight ahead on the other side.
[01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.890]  Stay with us.
[01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:58.313]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:04:58.653 --> 01:05:06.780]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.563]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:12.144 --> 01:05:22.973]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:23.593 --> 01:05:32.595]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:38.136]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:38.517 --> 01:05:45.698]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:46.018 --> 01:05:48.779]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:05:53.803 --> 01:05:58.829]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:01.533]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:06:01.553 --> 01:06:08.521]  Okay, my friends, we're now into the second hour.
[01:06:08.561 --> 01:06:09.002]  We're gonna get
[01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:17.813]  A quick report coming up at the bottom of the hour from Charlie Veitch, who made headlines in the Ottawa Citizen and other publications for being arrested for absolutely no reason.
[01:06:18.694 --> 01:06:29.600]  The media demonizes any protest against Wall Street or international private banks, you know, the top six global banks, the kings of the cartel, by saying you're a communist, you're an anarchist.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:34.142]  Well, the big foundations funded by the banks publicly fund all the major communist groups.
[01:06:34.762 --> 01:06:35.563]  The big banks want to
[01:06:36.483 --> 01:06:37.204]  We're good to go.
[01:06:55.922 --> 01:06:58.244]  That came out a few weeks ago, they were gearing up for it this time.
[01:06:58.704 --> 01:07:03.188]  So most of what you see, you got a few thousand peaceful demonstrators, how do you let the police attack them?
[01:07:03.568 --> 01:07:06.010]  You have a few cops dressed up, turn over some trash cans.
[01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:07.471]  Or provocateurs.
[01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:12.255]  So we'll be talking about that and how Mr. Veach got humiliated and basically tortured.
[01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:13.636]  That's coming up.
[01:07:15.888 --> 01:07:20.512]  And again, the police are going along with their own destruction here.
[01:07:21.152 --> 01:07:28.398]  All over the country and all over the world, including Spain and you name it, the police are having to give up part or all their pension funds to the bankers.
[01:07:29.199 --> 01:07:30.460]  Everything goes to the bankers.
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:39.987]  It's like these London Guardian reports and others about the 600 plus islands off the coast of Greece, which itself is an island, some of the most famous in the world, out in the Mediterranean.
[01:07:40.748 --> 01:07:43.130]  They're selling them, not to the IMF and World Bank,
[01:07:44.741 --> 01:07:46.102]  For debts they don't owe.
[01:07:47.262 --> 01:07:53.946]  Again, it was JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo.
[01:07:54.006 --> 01:08:00.309]  And those are the big corporate banking names that have the shares in the private Federal Reserve.
[01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:02.710]  The Federal Reserve is their front holding company.
[01:08:07.574 --> 01:08:26.916]  You read about these brokerage firm heads and these investment bank heads where some of them make four, five, six billion dollars personally a year off selling derivative crap that's totally worthless, and they know it's worthless, and they sell it to police pension funds, they sell it to fire pension funds, they sell it to city pension funds, to private pension funds.
[01:08:28.314 --> 01:08:38.644]  And then when it all goes belly up, the cities and counties go and borrow more money from the private central banks that they make up out of nothing at 15-20% interest.
[01:08:38.924 --> 01:08:49.535]  And when they lose their AAA rating like Portugal or Spain or 40-plus US states are now in the process of doing, according to Bloomberg, I'm going to cover that in a moment,
[01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:58.774]  Then, oh, you don't pay 10% or 12% interest anymore on made-up money we gave you that's zeros and ones on a computer.
[01:08:59.855 --> 01:09:02.817]  Now you pay 20, 30 percent, like Nigeria!
[01:09:03.698 --> 01:09:18.769]  And so, no more roads being paved, no more pensions, no more nothing, everything to the bankers, and then Greece is selling 600 islands, and the London Guardian lists the brokerage firm and hedge fund owners' names!
[01:09:19.810 --> 01:09:27.376]  They've got all the stolen money of Greece, and then the government comes and sells them the islands back for a little bit of money from the banker.
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:29.660]  I mean, these guys should all be arrested.
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:32.541]  What did the Texas Banking Association say two months ago?
[01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:43.064]  The President said, this banking reform bill, that's about to pass the House now, allows mega-banks that wrote the derivatives and caused the crisis to come take over our healthy local and state banks.
[01:09:44.265 --> 01:09:45.345]  And that's all this is for.
[01:09:45.685 --> 01:09:48.886]  And the big banks control all the regulators, they run Washington.
[01:09:51.516 --> 01:09:53.437]  What's in the Washington Post Friday?
[01:09:54.397 --> 01:09:58.039]  House Senate leaders finalize details of sweeping financial overhaul.
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:10.905]  A new Consumer Protection Bureau housed in the Federal Reserve, the people that did all this, would have independent funding and an independent leader and near total autonomy to write and enforce rules.
[01:10:11.525 --> 01:10:13.106]  To write the rules, the laws.
[01:10:13.996 --> 01:10:15.297]  More power to the Federal Reserve.
[01:10:16.177 --> 01:10:16.997]  Same thing in Greece.
[01:10:17.057 --> 01:10:17.998]  They gave them the same power.
[01:10:18.218 --> 01:10:20.379]  We're going into total receivership right now.
[01:10:20.899 --> 01:10:24.740]  You think the trillions they stole in the last few years and won't tell Congress where it went is bad?
[01:10:24.981 --> 01:10:25.961]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:10:25.981 --> 01:10:28.062]  And listen, they're going to take it all out of your hide.
[01:10:28.262 --> 01:10:30.723]  And they know raising taxes reduces tax receipts.
[01:10:31.063 --> 01:10:32.324]  They want you to go bankrupt.
[01:10:32.724 --> 01:10:34.424]  This is financial conquering.
[01:10:34.625 --> 01:10:37.286]  You know why the cops have been trained to eat their guts and ask for seconds?
[01:10:37.786 --> 01:10:39.486]  You know why they got federalization of police?
[01:10:39.727 --> 01:10:42.708]  And why they're training to paramilitarily take on gun owners everywhere?
[01:10:43.228 --> 01:10:45.530]  Because they're planning to fully overthrow this country.
[01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:49.312]  And these fluoride-head police out there, most of them are going to follow their orders.
[01:10:49.953 --> 01:10:51.674]  Just like the fluoride-head public is.
[01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:54.336]  Because the average American sucks their thumb and wears diapers.
[01:10:55.016 --> 01:10:56.237]  Unless they're watching a sports game.
[01:10:56.257 --> 01:10:58.639]  Then they stick their chest out and act all tough.
[01:10:58.699 --> 01:11:00.080]  My team, I'm worried about that!
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.522]  But they don't have their primitive resistance for liberty.
[01:11:03.702 --> 01:11:03.883]  No.
[01:11:04.023 --> 01:11:05.404]  You don't know what red blood's for.
[01:11:05.424 --> 01:11:06.685]  You don't know what fight's for.
[01:11:06.925 --> 01:11:11.648]  It isn't for going and cheering with your pom-poms like an effeminate trollop.
[01:11:12.449 --> 01:11:12.709]  Okay?
[01:11:14.924 --> 01:11:18.729]  Ugh, man, I tell you, I don't like going into bondage and seeing my country and my republic fall.
[01:11:18.809 --> 01:11:20.050]  I know when my country's falling.
[01:11:20.210 --> 01:11:22.813]  You're gonna find out, those of you out there laughing, real soon.
[01:11:25.356 --> 01:11:27.078]  You'd have wished you'd have stood up and spoke up.
[01:11:27.199 --> 01:11:28.280]  Maybe you will stand up.
[01:11:29.561 --> 01:11:33.045]  But let me tell you, me up here talking about it ain't gonna do much, unless you get in gear.
[01:11:34.141 --> 01:11:35.242]  Well, what do we do then, Alex?
[01:11:35.262 --> 01:11:35.882]  You get mad.
[01:11:35.923 --> 01:11:36.583]  You get involved.
[01:11:36.783 --> 01:11:37.544]  You get educated.
[01:11:37.724 --> 01:11:39.165]  You find out what I'm telling you is true.
[01:11:39.465 --> 01:11:40.687]  And then you decide what to do.
[01:11:40.907 --> 01:11:42.188]  I'm not telling you what to do.
[01:11:42.388 --> 01:11:45.551]  I'm telling you what's going on here, and you make the decision!
[01:11:47.172 --> 01:11:49.274]  We don't have much more time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:50.194 --> 01:11:55.339]  These people are so criminal, they jack the food and water supply to sterilize and give you cancer and dumb you down.
[01:11:55.559 --> 01:11:57.381]  That's why you're so sluggish and can't think.
[01:11:58.381 --> 01:12:01.344]  But if you're conscious of the chemical attack, you can break through the conditioning.
[01:12:02.722 --> 01:12:09.603]  But you were born to be slugs unless you wake up now!
[01:12:09.643 --> 01:12:11.164]  I can't believe what I just read here.
[01:12:11.304 --> 01:12:11.944]  It's made me mad.
[01:12:13.084 --> 01:12:23.446]  A new Consumer Protection Bureau, housed in the Federal Reserve, would have independent funding, an independent leader, and near total anonymity, autonomy, to write and enforce rules.
[01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:31.748]  The government would have broad new powers, that's not, the Federal Reserve is not the government, folks, to seize and wind down large financial firms, grab whoever they want,
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:36.503]  See, they don't really want to grab you and put a bag over your head and take you to FEMA camp, yet.
[01:12:36.883 --> 01:12:38.484]  First, they want to grab your bank account.
[01:12:38.965 --> 01:12:41.647]  Remember that, pull-up-the-Bloomberg article from three months ago?
[01:12:42.507 --> 01:12:46.851]  Feds telling pension funds to invest with feds.
[01:12:48.672 --> 01:12:50.194]  I think that was near the headline.
[01:12:50.694 --> 01:12:57.740]  And there's no law, but when these federal regulators are so criminal, and they're all Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan people, when they show up,
[01:12:58.683 --> 01:12:59.345]  This is on record.
[01:12:59.365 --> 01:13:00.047]  This is in Bloomberg.
[01:13:00.067 --> 01:13:03.576]  And they tell a big pension fund, a private one, you will invest in quote, failed banks.
[01:13:03.616 --> 01:13:03.977]  That's it.
[01:13:04.037 --> 01:13:06.584]  Government telling pension funds to invest in failed banks.
[01:13:06.624 --> 01:13:06.924]  That's it.
[01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:13.453]  And they say, or there's going to be some, we're going to find a crooked toenail and you're going to go to prison.
[01:13:13.813 --> 01:13:15.494]  The CEO goes, okay, here's the money.
[01:13:16.054 --> 01:13:17.515]  I guess I'll cash out next year.
[01:13:17.915 --> 01:13:21.297]  And that's why all these CEOs are just buying islands in the Bahamas and getting out of here.
[01:13:21.677 --> 01:13:25.439]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash.
[01:13:25.479 --> 01:13:25.899]  Bloomberg.
[01:13:26.299 --> 01:13:29.121]  And then you read that headline and it says they're just muscling them.
[01:13:29.321 --> 01:13:31.722]  This is total mafia takeover.
[01:13:32.022 --> 01:13:32.843]  And they're going for broke.
[01:13:33.023 --> 01:13:36.544]  I mean, if these big offshore banks have committed 10,000 crimes, why not commit 10,000 more?
[01:13:37.705 --> 01:13:40.487]  And after all, all you do is suck your thumb and watch football?
[01:13:40.867 --> 01:13:42.969]  Well, they're gonna take everything your family's got!
[01:13:43.269 --> 01:13:45.230]  Because you can't imagine standing up!
[01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:48.712]  Because you were taught from the time you were in diapers to worship government!
[01:13:49.073 --> 01:13:57.118]  Or you think Barack Obama, Barry Sitaro, or maybe, coming up in two and a half years, you think Mitt Romney, who wrote the Socialist Healthcare Bill.
[01:13:57.818 --> 01:13:59.880]  You think Mitt Romney's gonna save you?
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.963]  Well, if you idiots vote for any of these morons, you deserve what you get, okay?
[01:14:04.143 --> 01:14:06.584]  You better take your state houses back, your counties, your cities.
[01:14:06.804 --> 01:14:07.245]  I mean, look at this.
[01:14:08.564 --> 01:14:11.963]  The government would have the broad new powers to seize and wind down large financial...
[01:14:13.117 --> 01:14:16.740]  Failing firms, and to oversee the $600 trillion.
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:19.782]  First time I ever saw that in the Washington Post.
[01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:24.446]  $600 trillion these dirty bankers made up as a financial weapon to buy everything up.
[01:14:27.248 --> 01:14:30.071]  Madoff only made up $150 billion in fake money.
[01:14:30.411 --> 01:14:42.641]  These guys make $600 trillion, and they get to become financial gods of the world and openly announce a world government run by private banks, and suddenly police are wearing black uniforms and you don't see what's going on?
[01:14:44.178 --> 01:14:47.000]  Holy mackerel, Batman!
[01:14:48.201 --> 01:14:59.828]  To oversee the $600 trillion derivatives market, in addition, a council of regulators, headed by the Treasury Secretary, former Goldman Sachs, would monitor the financial landscape for potential systematic risk.
[01:15:00.569 --> 01:15:01.730]  That means grab whoever they want.
[01:15:02.691 --> 01:15:03.572]  Whatever banks they want.
[01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:04.493]  I mean, look at this.
[01:15:04.813 --> 01:15:05.234]  Biden.
[01:15:05.434 --> 01:15:07.276]  We can't recover all the jobs lost.
[01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:10.839]  Oh, first, NAPTA and GAAP is going to give you a great service job.
[01:15:10.879 --> 01:15:12.281]  Now the service jobs are shutting down.
[01:15:12.301 --> 01:15:15.664]  1.3 million more people to go off unemployment rolls this month.
[01:15:15.924 --> 01:15:16.705]  Here's Bloomberg.
[01:15:17.125 --> 01:15:23.031]  States of crisis for 46 governments facing Greek-style deficits, including U.S.
[01:15:23.071 --> 01:15:23.412]  states.
[01:15:27.355 --> 01:15:29.836]  And you notice California raised all these taxes the last two years?
[01:15:30.096 --> 01:15:32.117]  And then came out and said our tax receipts went down.
[01:15:32.357 --> 01:15:36.659]  They know full well when they raise taxes, tax receipts go down because it stalls the economy.
[01:15:36.859 --> 01:15:38.140]  They want the economy stalled.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.040]  These people are wreckers.
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:43.642]  If you don't know what wreckers are in seaman nomenclature, go look up wreckers.
[01:15:44.122 --> 01:15:44.762]  Sea wreckers.
[01:15:45.063 --> 01:15:49.084]  And learn how they would make ships wreck on purpose so they could loot them.
[01:15:50.185 --> 01:15:51.765]  I'm gonna come back, take your calls, okay?
[01:15:51.965 --> 01:15:52.786]  I got a bunch of other news.
[01:15:53.885 --> 01:15:58.128]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:15:58.448 --> 01:15:58.708]  Number 1.
[01:15:59.348 --> 01:16:02.510]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:16:02.771 --> 01:16:03.331]  Number 2.
[01:16:03.631 --> 01:16:08.194]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:16:08.534 --> 01:16:08.975]  It's true.
[01:16:09.275 --> 01:16:13.838]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:16:14.138 --> 01:16:14.678]  Number 3.
[01:16:14.978 --> 01:16:18.260]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:16:18.561 --> 01:16:22.263]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:16:22.463 --> 01:16:23.023]  Number four.
[01:16:23.263 --> 01:16:25.624]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:16:26.005 --> 01:16:29.386]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:16:29.686 --> 01:16:30.246]  Number five.
[01:16:30.486 --> 01:16:34.408]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:16:34.628 --> 01:16:39.390]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:16:39.690 --> 01:16:43.712]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:16:43.852 --> 01:16:45.413]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:16:45.633 --> 01:16:50.255]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:16:50.555 --> 01:16:50.635]  877-327-0365.
[01:16:50.655 --> 01:16:56.720]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:16:57.861 --> 01:16:58.782]  Tyranny is here.
[01:16:59.122 --> 01:17:02.845]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:05.267]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:10.731]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:17:11.152 --> 01:17:17.377]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:17:17.797 --> 01:17:23.359]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:27.461]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:17:27.961 --> 01:17:31.943]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:17:32.243 --> 01:17:37.765]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:17:38.185 --> 01:17:41.167]  It's only the beginning of the media lord's hellish plan.
[01:17:41.747 --> 01:17:43.167]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:17:43.728 --> 01:17:44.148]  It's here.

[01:17:54.237 --> 01:17:56.839]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:17:57.239 --> 01:18:02.224]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:18:02.584 --> 01:18:04.325]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:18:04.626 --> 01:18:09.450]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:10.591]  How much do you want?
[01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:11.552]  When do you want it?
[01:18:11.912 --> 01:18:13.514]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:18:13.814 --> 01:18:14.615]  When will you need it?
[01:18:14.875 --> 01:18:16.937]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:18:17.077 --> 01:18:18.178]  Will there be any food?
[01:18:18.419 --> 01:18:19.760]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:25.005]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:18:25.226 --> 01:18:28.349]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:18:28.789 --> 01:18:32.292]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:18:32.612 --> 01:18:33.593]  How much will you need?
[01:18:33.833 --> 01:18:34.454]  We don't know.
[01:18:34.734 --> 01:18:35.655]  How much do you want?
[01:18:35.855 --> 01:18:36.575]  All you can get.
[01:18:36.775 --> 01:18:37.616]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:18:37.876 --> 01:18:40.639]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:18:40.919 --> 01:18:42.680]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:43.621]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:18:54.502 --> 01:19:00.225]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[01:19:00.946 --> 01:19:05.388]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.

[01:19:40.471 --> 01:19:40.892]  Or call 800-655-1577.
[01:19:40.912 --> 01:19:43.774]  Prepare yourself and the ones you love today.
[01:19:43.834 --> 01:19:45.155]  fallofamerica.net.
[01:19:54.795 --> 01:19:57.638]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:19:58.399 --> 01:20:02.483]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:08.749 --> 01:20:12.333]  Alright, Wilson, Komal, Damaris, Jonathan, Jeff, everybody.
[01:20:12.353 --> 01:20:14.214]  I'm gonna get you at least the calls that are on the board.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:20.002]  Today, we've got about a 10 minute report coming up in the next segment from Toronto at the G20.
[01:20:20.302 --> 01:20:28.725]  Your private global criminal banker heads, along with the G8, $1.2 billion for their security over three days.
[01:20:29.145 --> 01:20:32.426]  That's near the entire budget of the city in three days.
[01:20:33.447 --> 01:20:34.527]  The city's budget for a year.
[01:20:35.908 --> 01:20:45.371]  And then you go research the security firms and the funds, most of that city money and federal money in Canada goes back to companies owned by these filthy offshore banks.
[01:20:46.972 --> 01:20:48.513]  So next time it'll be ten trillion.
[01:20:48.733 --> 01:20:50.933]  How about a hundred trillion dollars for their security?
[01:20:51.654 --> 01:20:53.394]  How about we just give everything to the bankers?
[01:20:53.694 --> 01:20:54.935]  Oh, thank you, Madoff!
[01:20:55.816 --> 01:21:09.020]  You go to prison for $150 billion or so in derivatives, but your cohorts, you set up the New York Stock Exchange, the modern NASDAQ, oh, they made $600 trillion, oh, we'll just let you take everything over then.
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:13.181]  I'm sorry, I said I'm going to your calls, I just, I'm having trouble handling it!
[01:21:14.189 --> 01:21:17.051]  And then you find out these big banks are funding all these eugenics movements.
[01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:23.697]  Then you find out they're the ones funding spiking your water so you're so drugged out and brain damaged you can't get angry.
[01:21:23.957 --> 01:21:25.258]  That's what fluoride does.
[01:21:26.059 --> 01:21:27.500]  We're living in the twilight zone.
[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:29.701]  Wilson in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:21:31.083 --> 01:21:32.444]  Yes, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:21:32.524 --> 01:21:34.205]  It's great to speak to you this evening.
[01:21:34.966 --> 01:21:42.652]  I was watching PBS over the weekend and I seen a show, Tavis Smiley, and he was speaking with a guy, Spencer Wells.
[01:21:43.832 --> 01:22:02.828]  Um and it was just kind of crazy because he was speaking so intelligently and he was speaking uh he's a population geneticist and he was speaking about the population getting out of control and it was just so crazy because he he was it just sounds so smooth and it was almost like
[01:22:03.786 --> 01:22:05.527]  I believe them when you say it, but don't do that.
[01:22:05.567 --> 01:22:06.207]  Oh no, they're not upset.
[01:22:06.227 --> 01:22:10.449]  They're trained to speak real soft, and we've got some things to fix it.
[01:22:10.489 --> 01:22:11.609]  There's too many people.
[01:22:12.209 --> 01:22:15.971]  And you can argue that there are a lot of humans, and humans do cause some problems.
[01:22:16.011 --> 01:22:20.032]  The point is, you don't have a covert program to brain damage us all.
[01:22:21.853 --> 01:22:23.293]  And so, yes, they're everywhere.
[01:22:23.333 --> 01:22:24.254]  They're all over the news.
[01:22:24.314 --> 01:22:27.635]  They teach kids that we've got to reduce world population.
[01:22:27.655 --> 01:22:31.416]  But the point is, it's all going on covertly, and we have all the government documents.
[01:22:31.436 --> 01:22:32.837]  This is admitted this is going on.
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:41.605]  Yes, and I'm just glad to say that, like you said, I like alternate sources of media information.
[01:22:41.625 --> 01:22:44.447]  You know, I learned a little from him, but it's always good to know the truth.
[01:22:45.027 --> 01:22:51.031]  And also, I've seen a documentary about William Kunstler, who was a lawyer.
[01:22:51.772 --> 01:22:53.433]  I'm pretty sure you're probably familiar with him.
[01:22:53.773 --> 01:23:00.858]  I was just curious why you never incorporated him in none of your documentaries, because some of the things he said, it was like hand in hand with
[01:23:01.318 --> 01:23:18.887]  Well, sir, there have been so many great patriots, so many wonderful people, and I have read some of his quotes, I'm aware of some of his work, but I mean, I rarely cover one-tenth of what I want to get to, and then get very angry at myself, but send me some more of his material, I'll try to cover it.
[01:23:19.167 --> 01:23:19.967]  Good points, Wilson.
[01:23:20.648 --> 01:23:28.732]  Yeah, no, I mean, the propaganda that humans are bad, humans are evil is everywhere, but then it's the elite that's selling you that you're bad, so you have this guilt,
[01:23:29.352 --> 01:23:32.558]  So the ruling class has an excuse to come in and further enslave you?
[01:23:34.557 --> 01:23:41.380]  And then, meanwhile, they're engaged in the genetic engineering and the rest of the stuff that's really vandalizing the biosphere of this planet.
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:44.461]  And detonating nuclear weapons and all the rest of it.
[01:23:44.481 --> 01:23:45.802]  They could care less about the Earth.
[01:23:46.122 --> 01:23:52.965]  They sell you on this idea that you've got to crawl away and do a hole and die so they can have the planet for themselves.
[01:23:53.546 --> 01:23:56.087]  And all these yuppies who say, well, there are too many people, Alex.
[01:23:56.467 --> 01:23:57.547]  We do have to reduce numbers.
[01:23:57.908 --> 01:24:02.850]  They feel like they're part of the elite because they were taught this in anthropology and sociology in college.
[01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:04.652]  That's all that's basically taught.
[01:24:05.753 --> 01:24:16.887]  But don't they understand there's a covert operation by the higher level acolytes who were given the same information they were given but taken to a higher level and were taught that eugenics was the official state religion?
[01:24:18.246 --> 01:24:19.126]  And that's
[01:24:34.673 --> 01:24:34.813]  Hello?
[01:24:34.833 --> 01:24:34.953]  Yeah?
[01:25:00.515 --> 01:25:01.916]  Yeah, how are you doing Alex Jones?
[01:25:01.936 --> 01:25:02.877]  Thank you again.
[01:25:03.237 --> 01:25:05.559]  Sorry, your phone is breaking up, you'll have to call me back on another phone.
[01:25:05.579 --> 01:25:08.482]  Damaris in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:25:08.502 --> 01:25:11.444]  Hello, hi, good afternoon Alex, how are you?
[01:25:11.544 --> 01:25:12.505]  Good, I'm fine, welcome.
[01:25:13.746 --> 01:25:15.568]  I have two quick questions for you.
[01:25:16.168 --> 01:25:22.394]  One of them is that, do you think that a 10-month baby is pre-owned to learn about everything that's happening with the government and everything?
[01:25:24.142 --> 01:25:28.746]  No, because the government is going to scare your child as soon as they can get them and turn them against you.
[01:25:30.108 --> 01:25:39.537]  And the government is going to take... I mean, it's normal for humans to tell their year-old child, two-year-old child, don't go to the mouth of the cave or a saber-toothed tiger may get you.
[01:25:39.737 --> 01:25:40.738]  You're supposed to scare them.
[01:25:41.298 --> 01:25:48.748]  Or, you know, the government isn't good like it was in the past, and some police are good, but others aren't.
[01:25:49.429 --> 01:25:58.221]  And, you know, you shouldn't talk to government people, and you should never answer their questions, because, you know, they might use you for medical experiments, because they do.
[01:25:59.242 --> 01:26:01.544]  I mean, it's now come out in mainstream news in England.
[01:26:01.604 --> 01:26:05.166]  I had British reporters here last Thursday, and they said, have you seen the one in Telegraph?
[01:26:05.486 --> 01:26:23.578]  Top, you know, reports confirming the government has quotas for kids and rich families wanting kids, so they go target good-looking, blonde-haired, blue-eyed people, that was, you know, in the article, basically, who are young and about to have a kid, and they trump up reasons to take their kid at birth.
[01:26:23.959 --> 01:26:26.901]  That, because rich families, rich white people want that white baby.
[01:26:27.221 --> 01:26:28.442]  It's much worse than that.
[01:26:29.202 --> 01:26:33.006]  And, uh, you know, just like my dad told me when I was 15, don't sign the organ donor card.
[01:26:33.386 --> 01:26:36.089]  Statistically, the hospitals won't give you the right care.
[01:26:36.249 --> 01:26:37.810]  In some facilities, they want your organs.
[01:26:38.451 --> 01:26:43.335]  And then I rolled my eyes, but still didn't sign the card, and then later found out that it was true.
[01:26:43.735 --> 01:26:47.119]  It came out on 60 Minutes that a lot of hospitals were killing people for their organs.
[01:26:47.979 --> 01:26:52.043]  Uh, and now Israel's had to admit they're killing Palestinians for their organs.
[01:26:52.243 --> 01:26:58.048]  Remember a year ago, they got all mad at the Dutch news and others for reporting it, and later they had to admit, okay, we are doing that?
[01:26:58.568 --> 01:27:05.674]  All these big governments, the Chinese government, our government... I'm ranting, ma'am, go ahead and finish your point.
[01:27:07.036 --> 01:27:07.676]  Okay, okay.
[01:27:08.437 --> 01:27:14.222]  The other question is, um, is there any vaccines that have no mercury in them, in the pedestal?
[01:27:14.781 --> 01:27:32.543]  Yes, and vaccines from the science I've seen, the doctors I've talked to, could be a good idea in some cases, if there was not liability protection for the makers, if there wasn't a history of eugenics firms running the vaccine companies, if there wasn't a history of so much death and destruction associated with them.
[01:27:33.857 --> 01:27:37.561]  The other issue is, about six, seven years ago, they had a new lie.
[01:27:38.101 --> 01:27:40.464]  That mercury had been taken out of the vaccines.
[01:27:40.664 --> 01:27:40.924]  No.
[01:27:41.765 --> 01:27:45.469]  Small lots were made that were mercury free, thimerosal free.
[01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:50.234]  But other vaccines, like the flu shots and others, quadrupled the amount of mercury.
[01:27:51.215 --> 01:27:51.515]  In them.
[01:27:51.835 --> 01:27:54.457]  But the mercury is the least of your problems in a vaccine.
[01:27:54.757 --> 01:27:59.659]  It's the RNA, the viruses, the other viruses they're adding.
[01:27:59.819 --> 01:28:08.563]  I mean, I have an article here today out of ABC News where they're promoting that kids need two H1N1 shots this next year again.
[01:28:09.503 --> 01:28:12.764]  And it's not even going to be a new mutated virus, a new vaccine.
[01:28:12.784 --> 01:28:13.865]  They're saying take the old one.
[01:28:14.225 --> 01:28:30.972]  When there's no reason to take the old one, even if you believe the H1N1 was deadly, and it's come out from the British Medical Journal, and the UN, and Wolfgang Wudarg, Dr. Wudarg, who we had on, the EU Commission, that they premeditatedly lied that the vaccine's deadly, and it was all a giant hoax.
[01:28:31.372 --> 01:28:34.213]  I had that editor of the British Medical Journal on two weeks ago.
[01:28:34.713 --> 01:28:36.875]  Three weeks ago before it was national news, now it is.
[01:28:37.236 --> 01:28:38.177]  It's all a fraud.
[01:28:38.197 --> 01:28:46.646]  These companies, Bayer Pharmaceutical was caught in court five years ago, knowingly putting the HIV in the factory.
[01:28:46.907 --> 01:28:48.749]  They knew it, they did it on purpose.
[01:28:48.969 --> 01:28:49.870]  Do you understand?
[01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:52.092]  These are eugenics companies, they're Nazis!

[01:29:55.985 --> 01:29:58.286]  We are part of a new world order.
[01:29:58.366 --> 01:30:01.126]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[01:30:01.566 --> 01:30:06.328]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:30:06.668 --> 01:30:10.869]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:30:11.189 --> 01:30:13.512]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:30:13.532 --> 01:30:16.056]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:30:16.076 --> 01:30:18.979]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:26.950]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:30:27.273 --> 01:30:32.558]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:30:32.658 --> 01:30:34.940]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:38.943]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:30:39.203 --> 01:30:40.104]  And I got news for you.
[01:30:40.264 --> 01:30:41.585]  You're everyone else.
[01:30:41.605 --> 01:30:42.606]  Invisible Empire.

[01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:47.410]  Thank you!
[01:31:53.413 --> 01:31:58.276]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:31:58.396 --> 01:31:59.157]  What have we got?
[01:31:59.377 --> 01:32:01.518]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:32:01.798 --> 01:32:02.519]  A republic.
[01:32:02.819 --> 01:32:05.400]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:32:05.481 --> 01:32:07.382]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:32:07.742 --> 01:32:09.643]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:32:09.763 --> 01:32:11.044]  So they think they own our land?
[01:32:11.444 --> 01:32:12.565]  They think they own our water?
[01:32:12.765 --> 01:32:13.165]  Children?
[01:32:13.365 --> 01:32:14.146]  Our education?
[01:32:14.486 --> 01:32:15.106]  Our money?
[01:32:15.327 --> 01:32:18.969]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:32:19.349 --> 01:32:23.975]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:32:24.315 --> 01:32:25.136]  We have the facts.
[01:32:25.336 --> 01:32:26.437]  We have the Constitution.
[01:32:26.497 --> 01:32:27.379]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:32:27.399 --> 01:32:28.240]  We have common law.
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:30.542]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:30.803 --> 01:32:34.587]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:32:34.687 --> 01:32:39.490]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:32:39.650 --> 01:32:41.011]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:32:41.131 --> 01:32:41.992]  Don't tread on me.

[01:32:58.362 --> 01:33:01.584]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:07.090 --> 01:33:08.812]  We got our guest on for one segment.
[01:33:08.832 --> 01:33:18.682]  In the last segment, I'm going to go to Forrest, Mark, Lance, Adam, Jeff, Jonathan, Moses, but just be ready, folks, because I'm going to go to you, give you about a minute, and then that's it, because the show's almost over.
[01:33:19.883 --> 01:33:21.765]  And I've got this other news I'll cover tomorrow.
[01:33:21.945 --> 01:33:22.706]  Oil insider.
[01:33:24.028 --> 01:33:32.973]  And CFR member predicts gulf evacuation of tens of millions and now the EPA is talking about it and I've got internal word in the Marines that they are training for it.
[01:33:33.394 --> 01:33:35.875]  This is in the Washington Post, so this is getting serious.
[01:33:36.255 --> 01:33:39.417]  This could be Obama's excuse to nationalize oil and a lot more.
[01:33:39.757 --> 01:33:41.158]  So I'll be covering that tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[01:33:41.178 --> 01:33:41.678]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:41.739 --> 01:33:42.039]  Central.
[01:33:42.059 --> 01:33:48.202]  If you don't have an AM and FM in your area, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, the free podcast, it's all there online.
[01:33:49.283 --> 01:33:50.384]  For the rest of this segment,
[01:33:51.403 --> 01:33:56.166]  Dan Dix of PressForTruth.ca, a great activist up there, a great reporter.
[01:33:56.426 --> 01:33:58.468]  And of course, Charlie Veitch of the Lubb Police.
[01:33:59.328 --> 01:34:00.349]  He is with us again.
[01:34:00.369 --> 01:34:02.390]  He made headlines being arrested for no reason.
[01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:07.674]  And here's the star, Toronto star, G20 law gives police sweeping powers to arrest people.
[01:34:08.454 --> 01:34:16.002]  They've been caught in the past hiring provocateurs so the police have an excuse to attack crowds in Ottawa, in Toronto and surrounding areas.
[01:34:16.262 --> 01:34:19.905]  And it was in the news last week that it looked like police were preparing for this again.
[01:34:20.466 --> 01:34:25.351]  They always call anyone who protests the bankers communists and give attention to the 10 or 15 communists.
[01:34:26.071 --> 01:34:28.753]  What about people who don't want to pay off these fake debts to the banks?
[01:34:28.793 --> 01:34:29.733]  We're not communists.
[01:34:30.253 --> 01:34:31.274]  In fact, we're capitalists.
[01:34:31.314 --> 01:34:33.715]  These bankers... I mean, is Madoff a capitalist?
[01:34:33.735 --> 01:34:36.977]  If I'm against Madoff or Ken Lay, am I against capitalism?
[01:34:37.738 --> 01:34:42.400]  So, to give us a report on what happened, we've got about four minutes with each of you.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:45.442]  Charlie Veitch, tell us what you've witnessed there now.
[01:34:47.042 --> 01:34:49.704]  Well yeah, here we are on day two, the final day of the actual summit.
[01:34:50.124 --> 01:34:58.370]  Because they made so many arrests yesterday, I heard a report of 500 people getting arrested in one go and taken out to that Guantanamo Bay style warehouse.
[01:34:58.890 --> 01:35:01.532]  The streets of Toronto are eerily quiet.
[01:35:01.892 --> 01:35:10.198]  We walked around for about an hour today trying to find something and all we could find was a group of about 500 to 1,000 people with about as many police.
[01:35:10.938 --> 01:35:20.501]  We did start a march walking through the centre of Toronto, outside the old City Hall, and the police were stopping the march every 100 metres, just for no reason.
[01:35:20.561 --> 01:35:22.542]  So there is no way to get around this city.
[01:35:22.982 --> 01:35:30.665]  It does feel like the not-too-distant future, as if this is how they are going to be treating cities once things get worse for us.
[01:35:31.967 --> 01:35:36.252]  Well, we are actually seeing much more mainstream media on the streets than actual protesters.
[01:35:36.312 --> 01:35:49.546]  The mainstream media are obviously allowed everywhere, but interestingly enough, we have identified a few people in plain clothes walking around the crowd, who then suddenly are able to walk behind the police lines, and they look like police as well, Alex.
[01:35:50.106 --> 01:35:52.887]  And we've caught them in Denver, we've caught them in Ottawa, we've caught them everywhere.
[01:35:52.907 --> 01:35:56.289]  Attacking crowds, and that's what it looks like from the sources.
[01:35:56.329 --> 01:35:59.610]  We've got, happened with a few anarchists knocking a few things over.
[01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:02.791]  That was then used as a pretext to move in on the real protesters.
[01:36:03.132 --> 01:36:04.052]  And they've done a good job.
[01:36:04.092 --> 01:36:08.294]  We've gone from 20-30,000 back in the 90's at demonstrations, to a few thousand now.
[01:36:09.374 --> 01:36:15.896]  They used police dogs on people at the G20 last year, even on old women coming out of grocery stores.
[01:36:16.516 --> 01:36:23.798]  This is costing a billion, two hundred million dollars for three days, basically the budget of Toronto for a year.
[01:36:24.399 --> 01:36:26.239]  So we're really being taught who God is.
[01:36:26.299 --> 01:36:32.561]  I mean, when God comes to town, the entire city shuts down and a billion plus dollars is given to the bankers.
[01:36:33.221 --> 01:36:34.502]  Let's talk to Dan Dix.
[01:36:34.542 --> 01:36:35.562]  Dan, what have you been witnessing?
[01:36:37.149 --> 01:36:39.331]  Uh, just absolute madness around here.
[01:36:39.391 --> 01:36:40.832]  It's completely unprecedented.
[01:36:40.872 --> 01:36:46.135]  I've never, uh, never could have imagined I'd see this in my own city, in the city of Toronto.
[01:36:46.896 --> 01:36:49.077]  Um, I'm just, I'm just blown away, really.
[01:36:49.097 --> 01:36:53.000]  I don't, you know, I'm just shocked at what I've been witnessing.
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:56.442]  Um, they've arrested, like Charlie said, upwards of 500 people now.
[01:36:57.873 --> 01:37:03.099]  Who are staying down in the Toronto Film Studios, that they are using as a temporary holding facility.
[01:37:03.399 --> 01:37:10.087]  And Charlie was in there, he described cameras above the toilets, the way they humiliated him, that it was like something out of a science fiction movie.
[01:37:11.141 --> 01:37:12.042]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:12.442 --> 01:37:19.426]  You know, Toronto used to pride itself on the fact that it has never used tear gas in any kind of a protest before.
[01:37:20.126 --> 01:37:21.928]  But that has recently changed.
[01:37:21.968 --> 01:37:26.150]  For the first time ever, tear gas has been deployed on the people of Toronto.
[01:37:27.351 --> 01:37:30.573]  So, you know, it's unbelievable what's happening right now.
[01:37:30.653 --> 01:37:32.374]  I haven't had a whole lot of sleep.
[01:37:32.434 --> 01:37:35.476]  We've been working hard covering this for the last three days.
[01:37:36.096 --> 01:37:37.578]  And I'm just blown away, Alex.
[01:37:53.471 --> 01:37:56.172]  I mean, it's just amazing that this is going on.
[01:37:56.192 --> 01:38:07.677]  I mean, here are the criminals that should be arrested, but instead I saw this AP photo of Sarkozy and Cameron and Obama just all laughing it up together.
[01:38:08.077 --> 01:38:10.798]  Instead of going to prison like Madoff, they get even more power.
[01:38:12.768 --> 01:38:16.070]  Yeah, Alex, it is a very sad state of affairs.
[01:38:16.110 --> 01:38:26.175]  We've seen people get pushed around here and we saw a 12-year-old boy yesterday get hogtied with those plastic zipper things and thrown in the back of a van and this 12-year-old boy was crying.
[01:38:26.515 --> 01:38:29.097]  This is just after they tear gassed the crowd.
[01:38:29.657 --> 01:38:34.359]  So, um, you really don't feel like you're walking around a civilized western world city.
[01:38:34.739 --> 01:38:39.101]  You really feel like you're walking around some city after an apocalypse or a nuclear attack.
[01:38:39.642 --> 01:38:46.665]  And you said the police relished arresting you for no reason and relished the petty power and relished looking at you while you went potty.
[01:38:47.699 --> 01:38:48.360]  Yes, they did.
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:49.040]  They certainly did.
[01:38:49.101 --> 01:38:50.422]  It wasn't just rattling the cage.
[01:38:50.482 --> 01:38:53.225]  The sergeant who arrested me, he had one of those U.S.
[01:38:53.265 --> 01:38:57.309]  Marine crew cuts and those piercing right-wing nasty eyes.
[01:38:57.889 --> 01:39:02.594]  And when I had to get my photograph taken, I had to hold up this board saying Veatch on it.
[01:39:02.794 --> 01:39:05.637]  And he was saying, ha, I feel like I'm here with a prized fish.
[01:39:05.717 --> 01:39:06.218]  Ha ha ha.
[01:39:06.238 --> 01:39:08.981]  I've caught one of these high-profile protesters.
[01:39:09.061 --> 01:39:09.641]  Ha ha ha.
[01:39:10.002 --> 01:39:11.083]  So they are enjoying it.
[01:39:11.263 --> 01:39:22.065]  Well, he'll enjoy having his pension fund taken, he'll enjoy being diagnosed with bone cancer at 47, or he'll be happy when his two-year-old, you know, dies of the vaccines he gives them and they get lowered into the ground.
[01:39:22.285 --> 01:39:24.025]  He'll find out what side he was really on.
[01:39:24.625 --> 01:39:38.528]  You know, I think that's the important message here, is we don't... I get angry at these police, I get angry at them being thugs and enjoying their petty power, and arresting my cameraman, we have the footage of it at the G20 last year, or not, yeah, just a few months ago, doing nothing.
[01:39:39.068 --> 01:39:44.531]  And beating up people and then, you know, torturing them once they got to the military facility.
[01:39:45.231 --> 01:39:47.712]  But, you know, let's just remember they're under mind control.
[01:39:48.512 --> 01:39:51.534]  And they've been told we're terrorists and that we're communists and all of this.
[01:39:51.914 --> 01:39:54.295]  They don't understand that these bankers are criminals.
[01:39:54.595 --> 01:39:56.216]  They probably think Madoff is good.
[01:39:57.608 --> 01:39:57.928]  Yeah.
[01:39:58.469 --> 01:40:10.117]  And just to add, Dan and I, because Dan lives right here in downtown Toronto, right next to the security fence, we got searched three times in 30 minutes and had our IDs checked and radioed in.
[01:40:10.457 --> 01:40:11.798]  So they're definitely on to us.
[01:40:12.058 --> 01:40:16.421]  And it's funny, every time Dan and I walk anywhere, if it's not for his Spartan beard or my megaphone,
[01:40:16.961 --> 01:40:23.826]  They are keeping a very close eye on us and it's a very scary feeling Alex when you cross the street and there's 30 police officers following you.
[01:40:24.226 --> 01:40:27.909]  And Dan and I have been filmed by police probably about five or six times today.
[01:40:27.949 --> 01:40:38.337]  They've got these super expensive semi-professional cameras, probably $10,000 cameras that obviously the Canadian taxpayers... Hey, there's plenty of money for the bankers, none for the slaves, but here's the issue.
[01:40:38.857 --> 01:40:45.239]  You know, at the end of the day, with all of these guys, this is all a drill on total martial law.
[01:40:45.519 --> 01:40:55.523]  That's why they have these G20 events all over the world, now every few months, costing billions wherever they go, is to practice local governments going under banker control.
[01:40:55.543 --> 01:41:02.185]  I mean, this is foreign bankers come in, and the city just literally attacks you, the blood bag.
[01:41:02.225 --> 01:41:03.946]  I mean, you're only there to supply blood to them.
[01:41:04.878 --> 01:41:17.845]  Yeah, and also let's not forget as well, it's a predictive programming to train the public in urban areas to comply, to allow arbitrary searches of your bags, to go through checkpoints, to have police radio you in and have to give your details.
[01:41:18.265 --> 01:41:19.706]  Dan was actually very good today.
[01:41:19.726 --> 01:41:22.567]  A female police officer said, can we search your bag?
[01:41:22.607 --> 01:41:25.609]  And Dan said, no, you have no right to search my bag.
[01:41:25.649 --> 01:41:26.649]  I haven't broken the law.
[01:41:26.669 --> 01:41:31.672]  But then five minutes later, another police officer said, yeah, you have to comply or you'll both be arrested.
[01:41:31.732 --> 01:41:33.873]  And so we both had our bags searched three times.
[01:41:34.542 --> 01:41:37.644]  My whole crew is actually being targeted this weekend.
[01:41:38.605 --> 01:41:41.147]  Anytime we go out, they see us with our cameras.
[01:41:41.767 --> 01:41:44.750]  They approach us and basically harass us.
[01:41:45.110 --> 01:41:47.712]  No matter where we are in the city, a lot of things are going on.
[01:41:47.772 --> 01:41:50.174]  Nothing is really centralized in any one area.
[01:41:50.494 --> 01:41:54.056]  There's little pockets of activity all over Toronto.
[01:41:54.076 --> 01:41:55.798]  Yeah, the G20 criminals are everywhere.
[01:41:56.767 --> 01:41:57.328]  Absolutely.
[01:41:57.468 --> 01:42:00.511]  And you know, they keep coming right up to us.
[01:42:00.551 --> 01:42:05.997]  As soon as we walk out of my apartment, we get surrounded by a gaggle of four or five police officers.
[01:42:06.057 --> 01:42:07.799]  And this is the sacred police system.
[01:42:07.839 --> 01:42:13.605]  I mean, again, it's all about no one's allowed to protest the Madoffs that are in there robbing you blind.
[01:42:15.086 --> 01:42:32.692]  The police have been internationalized, and again, I mean, we have the footage at the G20 of private security people grabbing people off the streets and snatching and grabbing them into vehicles, and old women coming out of grocery stores with bread and lettuce going, officer, I'm... And the cops, they just let dogs go and go, no one in the city!
[01:42:32.932 --> 01:42:33.773]  No one on the street!
[01:42:34.853 --> 01:42:37.255]  The news said, hey, we now attack all women with dogs.
[01:42:37.555 --> 01:42:38.635]  Well, hey, don't worry, cops.
[01:42:38.735 --> 01:42:40.877]  Your family's going to be run over by the globalists, too.
[01:42:41.217 --> 01:42:44.059]  You get to drink out of the same devilish system as we do.
[01:42:44.439 --> 01:42:45.259]  Men, good job.
[01:42:45.299 --> 01:42:50.082]  We'll talk to you again coming up tomorrow, popping in on the weekday show to get a report on the aftermath.
[01:42:50.102 --> 01:42:50.723]  Great job.
[01:42:50.983 --> 01:42:52.464]  Phone calls and more news straight ahead.
[01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:58.077]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:42:58.397 --> 01:42:58.657]  Number 1.
[01:42:59.297 --> 01:43:02.459]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:03.280]  Number 2.
[01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:08.143]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:43:08.483 --> 01:43:08.924]  It's true.
[01:43:09.224 --> 01:43:13.787]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:43:14.087 --> 01:43:14.627]  Number 3.
[01:43:14.927 --> 01:43:18.209]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:22.192]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:43:22.392 --> 01:43:22.953]  Number 4.
[01:43:23.193 --> 01:43:25.556]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:43:25.956 --> 01:43:29.340]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:29.860]  Number 5.
[01:43:30.441 --> 01:43:34.365]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:43:34.586 --> 01:43:39.351]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:43:39.631 --> 01:43:43.652]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:43:43.793 --> 01:43:45.353]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:43:45.573 --> 01:43:47.674]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:43:54.264 --> 01:43:56.845]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:43:57.265 --> 01:44:02.226]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:44:02.586 --> 01:44:04.327]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:44:04.627 --> 01:44:09.448]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:44:09.628 --> 01:44:10.589]  How much do you want?
[01:44:10.829 --> 01:44:11.549]  When do you want it?
[01:44:11.949 --> 01:44:13.531]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:44:13.831 --> 01:44:14.652]  When will you need it?
[01:44:14.892 --> 01:44:16.974]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:44:17.114 --> 01:44:18.195]  Will there be any food?
[01:44:18.436 --> 01:44:19.777]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:44:19.977 --> 01:44:25.042]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:44:25.243 --> 01:44:28.366]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:44:28.806 --> 01:44:32.308]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:33.609]  How much will you need?
[01:44:33.869 --> 01:44:34.490]  We don't know.
[01:44:34.770 --> 01:44:35.671]  How much do you want?
[01:44:35.871 --> 01:44:36.591]  All you can get.
[01:44:36.791 --> 01:44:37.632]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:44:37.892 --> 01:44:40.654]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:44:40.934 --> 01:44:42.695]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:44:42.715 --> 01:44:43.636]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:44:54.554 --> 01:45:00.299]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.444]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[01:45:06.265 --> 01:45:19.817]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McIlnady, and myself, Alex Jones.
[01:45:20.578 --> 01:45:25.020]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.

[01:45:43.889 --> 01:45:45.210]  fallofamerica.net.
[01:45:54.827 --> 01:45:58.450]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:45:58.770 --> 01:46:06.896]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:46:07.637 --> 01:46:11.680]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:23.089]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:46:23.709 --> 01:46:32.733]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:46:33.234 --> 01:46:38.276]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:46:38.656 --> 01:46:45.839]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:48.561]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:46:54.727 --> 01:46:57.589]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:46:58.309 --> 01:47:01.651]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:02.132 --> 01:47:08.716]  Folks, we have to stop being Mr. Nice Guy.
[01:47:08.736 --> 01:47:14.719]  We have to realize the government's trying to intimidate us worldwide, trying to break our backs psychologically so we'll put up with anything.
[01:47:14.739 --> 01:47:18.642]  I mean, look at this headline out of Reuters.
[01:47:20.692 --> 01:47:22.073]  This is MSNBC, excuse me.
[01:47:22.373 --> 01:47:25.655]  Recovery means no undue edge for nations, Obama.
[01:47:25.935 --> 01:47:26.775]  That's globalism.
[01:47:27.375 --> 01:47:30.877]  But they don't raise the third world and lower the West, they lower everyone.
[01:47:31.538 --> 01:47:37.821]  That's why they had the Copenhagen Treaty last year and the third world got the treaty and said, this has almost double the taxes on us of the West.
[01:47:38.221 --> 01:47:41.122]  We were going to vote for it because we were supposed to rob the rich nations.
[01:47:41.483 --> 01:47:41.803]  No, no, no.
[01:47:41.823 --> 01:47:43.644]  This is the bankers robbing everyone.
[01:47:44.104 --> 01:47:46.085]  This is everyone being third world slaves.
[01:47:47.205 --> 01:47:47.286]  U.S.
[01:47:47.346 --> 01:47:49.206]  President Barack Obama said Sunday at the G20,
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:55.026]  That countries must not have any undue advantage if the world is to build a strong and durable economic recovery.
[01:47:55.066 --> 01:47:55.767]  That's world government.
[01:47:56.167 --> 01:48:00.392]  A strong and durable recovery also requires countries not having an undue advantage.
[01:48:01.479 --> 01:48:03.660]  That means America gave up its industry because we had an advantage.
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:03.901]  Remember?
[01:48:04.261 --> 01:48:07.403]  A strong and durable recovery also requires countries not having an undue advantage.
[01:48:07.743 --> 01:48:10.245]  Obama told journalists at the end of the G20 talks in Canada.
[01:48:10.705 --> 01:48:12.106]  This isn't political correctness, folks.
[01:48:12.126 --> 01:48:13.307]  This is mercantilism.
[01:48:13.367 --> 01:48:13.867]  Research it.
[01:48:15.108 --> 01:48:18.770]  So we also discussed the need for currencies that are market-driven, he added.
[01:48:19.031 --> 01:48:20.632]  Yeah, and they're about to get rid of our currency.
[01:48:20.672 --> 01:48:22.313]  We're still going to have it, but it's going to be...
[01:48:24.298 --> 01:48:27.065]  And I meant to get to this, but the guys just gave it to me again to remind me.
[01:48:27.386 --> 01:48:28.248]  This is AP.
[01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:29.672]  CIA's Panetta.
[01:48:29.792 --> 01:48:31.757]  Iran has enough uranium for two bombs.
[01:48:33.465 --> 01:48:33.725]  Yes, Alex.
[01:48:33.745 --> 01:48:34.746]  I have
[01:48:58.962 --> 01:49:06.274]  Several good videos for you that you can look up on YouTube and a pen and paper might be good for you.
[01:49:06.294 --> 01:49:09.399]  Go ahead.
[01:49:10.261 --> 01:49:11.002]  While you get that.
[01:49:12.577 --> 01:49:20.259]  Type in six-year-old girl on no-fly list, and this is a new one off of Fox News.
[01:49:20.299 --> 01:49:22.380]  No, no, that's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:24.100]  We've got that.
[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:25.721]  The evil six-year-old.
[01:49:26.161 --> 01:49:36.183]  And they're also now harassing people with fake artificial limbs, even though they know, and they're making people in wheelchairs that can't walk, they're making them get up and walk without help or they can't fly.
[01:49:36.443 --> 01:49:37.804]  It's all about humiliation.
[01:49:37.824 --> 01:49:41.765]  It's all about pushing us to set the precedent where we'll do whatever they say.
[01:49:42.165 --> 01:49:48.531]  And now they admit they record our naked bodies, they save the images, it's all funny to them, they laugh at our genitals.
[01:49:48.952 --> 01:49:50.253]  This is your criminal government.
[01:49:50.273 --> 01:49:50.614]  Go ahead.
[01:49:51.795 --> 01:49:55.078]  They staged the terror attacks so they could turn us into slaves.
[01:49:55.138 --> 01:49:55.919]  It's so simple.
[01:49:56.179 --> 01:49:57.600]  So they could invade other countries.
[01:49:57.801 --> 01:49:59.803]  We have the internal homeland security documents.
[01:50:00.023 --> 01:50:01.665]  We are the terrorist, according to them.
[01:50:02.245 --> 01:50:03.626]  Because they are the real terrorist.
[01:50:04.307 --> 01:50:05.228]  What's the other one, Jonathan?
[01:50:05.268 --> 01:50:05.809]  I gotta move here.
[01:50:07.057 --> 01:50:11.961]  Alright, another one is about the corruption of the police department in New Orleans.
[01:50:12.361 --> 01:50:16.584]  You type in culture of police corruption into YouTube.
[01:50:16.604 --> 01:50:20.747]  Well, they were the main ones robbing everything in liquor stores and jewelry stores.
[01:50:20.807 --> 01:50:21.747]  It's crazy, Jonathan.
[01:50:22.047 --> 01:50:23.308]  Good points, I'll look into that.
[01:50:23.769 --> 01:50:29.032]  And again, if you can't admit police in history tend to become corrupt, they will then take over and become corrupt.
[01:50:29.252 --> 01:50:32.655]  But here it's like, cops never did anything wrong and you're for the criminals.
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:35.522]  Yeah, I'm against all criminals.
[01:50:36.363 --> 01:50:37.864]  Let's talk to Jeff in Canada.
[01:50:38.124 --> 01:50:39.185]  You're on the air.
[01:50:39.225 --> 01:50:39.926]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:50:41.328 --> 01:50:41.788]  Hi, Alex.
[01:50:41.828 --> 01:50:42.809]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:50:43.029 --> 01:50:43.710]  Welcome, sir.
[01:50:44.050 --> 01:50:46.112]  First, I got a couple of points that I want to make.
[01:50:46.172 --> 01:50:48.074]  I'm just back from the G20 in Toronto.
[01:50:48.515 --> 01:50:51.097]  I met up with some other guys from... I'm from... We are Change Windsor.
[01:50:51.117 --> 01:50:51.798]  What did you witness?
[01:50:51.838 --> 01:50:52.158]  Tell us.
[01:50:53.342 --> 01:51:00.526]  Well, first of all, I wanted to go over an article that I read about the secret meeting of the G20 with the Canadian Finance Minister, Jim Flaherty.
[01:51:01.287 --> 01:51:02.628]  He met in what they called the B20.
[01:51:02.708 --> 01:51:07.050]  That's a secret meeting of the CEOs of the G20 countries.
[01:51:07.070 --> 01:51:08.091]  Yeah, that's another headline.
[01:51:08.151 --> 01:51:14.155]  Obama slipped off for a secret meeting, like he did with Hillary when we were at Bilderberg in 2008.
[01:51:15.055 --> 01:51:15.716]  We were there.
[01:51:15.956 --> 01:51:17.737]  The rest of the media was like, where are they?
[01:51:19.892 --> 01:51:20.232]  Go ahead.
[01:51:20.632 --> 01:51:29.457]  Yeah, I also wanted to go over, I also noticed one of the things that scared me just as much as the police state was, was the number of communists on the street.
[01:51:29.497 --> 01:51:31.478]  I just want to confirm everything that you're saying today.
[01:51:31.859 --> 01:51:34.260]  There were communists everywhere and they were well funded.
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:39.863]  They had these big giant banners up and they were on every street corner with printed newspaper published.
[01:51:40.163 --> 01:51:46.969]  And the police left them alone because I've been at other events and our sources say they were just, they were wonderful.
[01:51:47.009 --> 01:51:51.072]  It was only We Are Change and Patriot groups that they were after.
[01:51:52.634 --> 01:52:05.224]  My last point is, I also wanted to make the point that one of the reasons why I think they're doing these G20s and they're putting so much funding in it is because they're cashing all of their weapons, all of their armor for when they do implement martial law.
[01:52:05.244 --> 01:52:06.766]  Somebody had mentioned that to me and I thought I'd...
[01:52:07.366 --> 01:52:20.691]  No, these are laboratory takeover drills, so they're visiting all the major cities, they're meeting every month, all over the world, way more money is spent than should, and they admit they're training to have local police go under foreign bank control.
[01:52:20.731 --> 01:52:26.054]  That's like the city of Austin, 2.6 billion in taxes on energy to pay the banks.
[01:52:26.974 --> 01:52:31.456]  It's just, the banks are coming into our cities and raping us financially.
[01:52:31.496 --> 01:52:31.876]  Go ahead.
[01:52:33.238 --> 01:52:36.420]  Last point I wanted to make was about these agents provocateurs.
[01:52:36.781 --> 01:52:37.641]  I've seen them there.
[01:52:38.122 --> 01:52:44.706]  There was a couple of people there with InfoWars shirts on and he had a video camera and we were trying to get their faces on video camera.
[01:52:45.047 --> 01:52:56.475]  I met up with some 9-11 truth guys from Toronto that had the 9-11 was an inside job and the InfoWars.com on the back of it and we were shouting, resist the new world order, 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:52:56.495 --> 01:52:59.317]  So we were really pushing the message and trying to get the message out.
[01:52:59.717 --> 01:53:01.019]  What were the provocateurs doing?
[01:53:01.059 --> 01:53:02.361]  You've done a great job, Jeff.
[01:53:14.645 --> 01:53:27.855]  Um, well basically they were all huddled up together, and then all of a sudden they dispersed, and there was one here, one over there, one over there, but they did have the combat style boots on, like we've seen in the past at the Security and Prosperity Partnership in Montreal.
[01:53:28.315 --> 01:53:31.797]  Um, but they had walkie-talkies in their hand, they looked like they were organized.
[01:53:31.818 --> 01:53:34.179]  Yeah, that's when we caught the cops attacking their own cops.
[01:53:34.279 --> 01:53:35.640]  Get that video up on YouTube.
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:36.881]  Great job, Jeff!
[01:53:37.241 --> 01:53:38.582]  Adam in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:53:38.602 --> 01:53:40.324]  Yeah, two things.
[01:53:40.544 --> 01:53:43.466]  Uh, first of all, I'm here in the, uh, half the states are broke.
[01:53:44.165 --> 01:53:52.187]  And, uh, but then, again, with the comprehensive annual financial report from Walter Burian, is this all fake, that the states are broke?
[01:53:52.787 --> 01:53:56.708]  Well, number one, you notice they say the states are broke.
[01:53:56.788 --> 01:54:02.250]  That's on budget, so they want to raise the taxes, because most of the money now goes to interest on the debt.
[01:54:02.590 --> 01:54:04.891]  But depending on the state, it varies.
[01:54:04.951 --> 01:54:13.153]  But yes, the states were not broke a few years ago, but they were invested in the $600 trillion, as the Washington Post now admits, derivatives.
[01:54:13.573 --> 01:54:16.154]  So the banks sold them that, got money.
[01:54:16.695 --> 01:54:32.323]  Now the states have had their assets devalued by about half, so they're overextended, and so they're trying to now raise more money, and they've lost their credit ratings, many of them, so they're paying higher interest to the same private banks.
[01:54:32.403 --> 01:54:34.805]  So it's a state-by-state issue.
[01:54:36.539 --> 01:54:39.805]  Okay, and the other point is on vaccines and viral theory.
[01:54:40.566 --> 01:54:43.010]  There's a British investigative journalist named Jeanine Roberts.
[01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:48.941]  She's got an excellent book and a website called fearoftheinvisible.com is the website.
[01:54:49.759 --> 01:55:07.934]  And what the field of molecular biology is apparently finding out is that a lot of these particles that are being sort of called viruses are, they're emitted by cells in a normal cell function, in the process of communication and repair and things, and they may in fact be a response
[01:55:08.570 --> 01:55:11.491]  To sell stress and disease, not the cause of it.
[01:55:12.332 --> 01:55:25.458]  And in that book, she also outlines how Robert Gallo, the supposed discoverer of AIDS, all of his work, his four main papers on which all of the HIV theory and all the funding is based, were found to be completely fraudulent in here.
[01:55:25.598 --> 01:55:29.840]  AIDS, HIV is a cover for other soft kill weapons introduced.
[01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:33.121]  The Navy developed the bioweapon, and I appreciate your call.
[01:55:33.141 --> 01:55:36.303]  Now this is all declassified, just the general public doesn't know it.
[01:55:37.463 --> 01:55:38.524]  Great point, caller.
[01:55:38.665 --> 01:55:41.687]  Man, I wish I had time to... Look, we're going to have four hours tomorrow to take calls.
[01:55:42.007 --> 01:55:43.709]  In fact, how many guests do I have tomorrow?
[01:55:43.729 --> 01:55:46.311]  I have just... Good, so we're wide open tomorrow.
[01:55:46.351 --> 01:55:49.494]  Let's leave it wide open except for G20 people in the last hour.
[01:55:49.514 --> 01:55:51.576]  Because I want to take calls, calls, calls.
[01:55:52.897 --> 01:55:54.718]  Almost out of time, but let's jam in a couple more.
[01:55:55.019 --> 01:55:55.899]  Adam in Canada.
[01:55:55.919 --> 01:55:56.600]  We just talked to Adam.
[01:55:57.281 --> 01:55:57.921]  Mark in Florida.
[01:55:57.941 --> 01:55:58.401]  You're on the air.
[01:55:58.422 --> 01:55:58.742]  Go ahead.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:10.107]  Yeah, a quick comment here, Alex, about the sad state of affairs in the southern states where they would turn people into refugees because of the fumes.
[01:56:10.588 --> 01:56:10.848]  Yes.
[01:56:11.028 --> 01:56:20.135]  The CIA in the 1950s, via the Saigon military mission, caused a lot of unrest in North Vietnam.
[01:56:20.856 --> 01:56:24.340]  And, uh, they brought, uh, uh, they, the U.S.
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:38.798]  Navy and Air Force then brought a million North Vietnamese into the, uh, South, into South Vietnam, where everything was settled and had been that way for thousands of years, and they brought all these, these new folks in there and caused major unrest in that country.
[01:56:39.358 --> 01:56:40.819]  And that contributed to the war.
[01:56:40.839 --> 01:56:41.639]  Well, they wanted a war.
[01:56:41.659 --> 01:56:42.840]  They funded Hershey, man.
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:43.881]  They staged the whole thing.
[01:56:43.901 --> 01:56:46.242]  Fletcher Browdy, head of Black Ops, exposed it.
[01:56:46.542 --> 01:56:51.865]  Our government funds all the communists, all the fascists, Saddam, Bin Laden.
[01:56:52.226 --> 01:56:57.689]  I mean, it's all been declassified that McCarthy was right that the Pentagon was running the Soviet Union, basically.
[01:56:58.775 --> 01:57:10.959]  I mean, that's why Bob Chapman, who was in intelligence, said Friday he believes if they do go with this Marshall Law on the Gulf, that the Pentagon is going to spray stuff down there as a pretext that it won't really be the fumes.
[01:57:12.379 --> 01:57:14.379]  Because we know they've done things like that in the past.
[01:57:14.419 --> 01:57:15.860]  I mean, these people don't play games, folks.
[01:57:18.459 --> 01:57:18.879]  Great point.
[01:57:18.899 --> 01:57:22.261]  Back to what I was thinking of, Bob Chapman's comment.
[01:57:22.821 --> 01:57:23.481]  Great job, Mark.
[01:57:23.521 --> 01:57:24.201]  Call me back tomorrow.
[01:57:24.221 --> 01:57:26.883]  I'm sorry to Lance, Mark, Forrest, Moses, Jeff.
[01:57:27.143 --> 01:57:27.863]  You call me tomorrow.
[01:57:27.903 --> 01:57:28.723]  We'll keep those names.
[01:57:28.743 --> 01:57:30.604]  You go to front of the line tomorrow.
[01:57:30.724 --> 01:57:31.705]  Wide open phones.
[01:57:32.685 --> 01:57:33.465]  God bless you.
[01:57:33.825 --> 01:57:35.766]  Got some other important guests coming up this week.
[01:57:35.826 --> 01:57:36.727]  Great job, crew.
[01:57:36.747 --> 01:57:38.587]  Folks, all I'm doing is telling you the truth.
[01:57:38.847 --> 01:57:41.909]  It's up to you to go check out what I'm saying and see for yourself that it's true.
