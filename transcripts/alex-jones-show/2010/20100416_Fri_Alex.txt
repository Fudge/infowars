[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.031]  This is the beginning of what happens when you lose a democracy.
[00:00:04.852 --> 00:00:08.354]  Richard Fein is an accomplished attorney who holds a Ph.D.
[00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:14.718]  in international law and was an antitrust attorney with the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.
[00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:28.206]  He is sounding the clarion call from his cell in the Los Angeles County Central Men's Jail, where he is being held without trial, without bail, without an attorney, and with every appeal denied.
[00:00:29.048 --> 00:00:31.771]  Oh, there's absolutely no question that I'm a political prisoner.
[00:00:32.112 --> 00:00:43.906]  I mean, none whatsoever, because the political circumstance that has created this situation is that you have a straight out and out abuse of power that is taking place here.
[00:00:47.205 --> 00:00:49.306]  Okay, we got Bob Chapman coming up.
[00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:50.767]  Your phone calls in the next hour.
[00:00:50.887 --> 00:00:52.767]  A bunch of important news I want to get to.
[00:00:53.128 --> 00:00:55.149]  Homegrown solo terrorist.
[00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.070]  As bad as Al-Qaeda, FBI chief says.
[00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.631]  So they're really getting ready to use homeland security against the American people.
[00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:03.052]  That's what it was originally set up for.
[00:01:03.072 --> 00:01:05.953]  That's what Section 802 of the USA Patriot Act states.
[00:01:06.554 --> 00:01:11.616]  All misdemeanors are basically acts of terrorism and all of your rights are stripped.
[00:01:12.296 --> 00:01:15.118]  So there's no doubt we're going deep into tyranny right now.
[00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:21.842]  They have the Belligerent Act, where citizens can be secretly arrested by the military, given enhanced interrogation, i.e.
[00:01:21.922 --> 00:01:22.362]  torture.
[00:01:23.222 --> 00:01:33.328]  But this case is going before the Supreme Court in their conference committee next Friday, and they're looking at actually hearing the full case.
[00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:36.170]  So this has now gone to the Supreme Court.
[00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:41.113]  So it's gone directly from a lower court in California,
[00:01:42.873 --> 00:01:57.123]  All the way to the Supreme Court, not going through the other courts in between, because the judge has not recused himself and is holding this gentleman as a political prisoner, Richard Fine.
[00:01:57.744 --> 00:02:04.269]  And you can read the story at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Daily News has the headline, Supreme Court to Hear Fine Case.
[00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:05.529]  I don't know.
[00:02:20.914 --> 00:02:34.992]  Advocate for justice and freedom, Leslie Dutton, is a civic activist and former account executive and vice president of a national public government affairs firms, represents diverse clients relating to the media, the U.S.
[00:02:35.032 --> 00:02:36.774]  Congress, and the California State Legislature.
[00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:40.178]  As a founding president of the American Association of Women, Ms.
[00:02:40.218 --> 00:02:46.744]  Dutton also spearheaded issue-oriented campaigns ranging from community charter amendments to University of California tuition policies.
[00:02:47.365 --> 00:02:55.813]  As producer for the Full Disclosure Network, she has received a 2001 Emmy for Public Affairs Programming from the Academy of Television and Arts and Sciences.
[00:02:56.454 --> 00:02:59.116]  And we're very honored to have her with us.
[00:03:00.557 --> 00:03:08.019]  I mean, this case is like something out of Kafka or 1984, but it's happening in America, and we see this more and more.
[00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:19.042]  This is not the only case like this I've seen, but she joins us now to break down, and it looks like we're going to have Mr. Fine on for 30 minutes or so in the last hour.
[00:03:19.642 --> 00:03:30.746]  So this will be a bifurcated or divided interview in this hour and then coming up in the next hour we're going to try to talk from his jail cell if he can get through on the phone from his jail cell.
[00:03:31.406 --> 00:03:34.067]  But Leslie Dutton, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[00:03:34.507 --> 00:03:35.307]  You're welcome, Alec.
[00:03:35.967 --> 00:03:37.708]  Okay, a lot of people aren't aware of this case.
[00:03:37.788 --> 00:03:42.509]  Recap the basics of what's going on and how outrageous this is and where this is going.
[00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.511]  Well, it's outrageous because we don't hear about cases like this very often.
[00:03:48.198 --> 00:03:49.879]  The media keeps us in the dark.
[00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.960]  But Mr. Fine's case is unusual in the sense that he has drawn the line.
[00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:59.502]  He refused to obey a judge's illegal order.
[00:03:59.982 --> 00:04:07.645]  A judge who should have recused himself because he accepts illegal payments from a party in the case before him.
[00:04:08.085 --> 00:04:09.366]  That party was the L.A.
[00:04:09.426 --> 00:04:09.846]  County.
[00:04:10.506 --> 00:04:13.287]  And the county has been paying the judges here in
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.423]  In the county for 25 years, illegally.
[00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:22.486]  And there was a court case called Sturgeon v. the County of L.A.
[00:04:22.506 --> 00:04:27.629]  that the appellate court held that those payments were illegal because the judges work for the state.
[00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.272]  And the county is one of the biggest litigants in the county.
[00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:40.838]  So it is very hard to, it isn't hard to understand when Mr. Feinbich tells us that by their own admission, the county has
[00:04:41.403 --> 00:04:43.843]  Never lost a case except for three.
[00:04:43.863 --> 00:04:50.445]  So the county's looking at this like risk management, paying off the judges according to Mr. Fine.
[00:04:50.825 --> 00:05:05.207]  But what he did was rather than obey the judge's illegal order, and the judge ordered him to pay $47,000, which he didn't have, to the county to cover the cost of an EIR report.
[00:05:05.687 --> 00:05:08.888]  That's an environmental impact report on a development.
[00:05:09.377 --> 00:05:14.119]  Well, Mr. Fine is sitting in jail because he refuses to cave in to the corruption.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:22.123]  And I have to tell you, the Full Disclosure Network has been covering this since the day before he was arrested when we interviewed him.
[00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:28.306]  He knew what he was getting into, but he didn't realize how bad the situation was.
[00:05:28.406 --> 00:05:38.851]  And what he's done in all the courts that he has filed from his jail cell, his appeals, his writ of habeas corpus, his motions and so forth, is that he has documented
[00:05:39.827 --> 00:05:41.730]  Everything that is happening.
[00:05:42.111 --> 00:05:45.736]  The courts, when they responded, they violated every rule.
[00:05:46.417 --> 00:05:49.422]  They ignored his rights and due process.
[00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:52.337]  And they covered for each other.
[00:05:52.377 --> 00:05:55.360]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.724]  FullDisclosure.net is the website if you want to find out more.
[00:06:00.804 --> 00:06:03.086]  FullDisclosure.net.
[00:06:03.347 --> 00:06:04.948]  But again, you're a high caliber person.
[00:06:05.028 --> 00:06:09.092]  I mean, you're civically involved at the highest levels of the community and government.
[00:06:09.332 --> 00:06:11.013]  You're an Emmy Award winner.
[00:06:11.614 --> 00:06:14.176]  So, I mean, you've checked into this yourself.
[00:06:14.676 --> 00:06:17.399]  And Mr. Fine is no slouch either.
[00:06:18.058 --> 00:06:19.299]  No, he has a Ph.D.
[00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:20.700]  in international law.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.744]  He was an antitrust prosecutor for the Department of Justice in Washington.
[00:06:26.804 --> 00:06:34.690]  But it was when his career became so successful as a consumer and taxpayer's advocate that he ran into trouble.
[00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.692]  And he had great success outside of L.A.
[00:06:37.732 --> 00:06:38.092]  County.
[00:06:38.453 --> 00:06:39.113]  But in L.A.
[00:06:39.153 --> 00:06:47.039]  County, he found, as he described it, the corruption was so bad that there wasn't a fair shake in the court.
[00:06:47.597 --> 00:06:51.226]  And that the people are not getting a fair shake, and he had had it.
[00:06:51.266 --> 00:06:56.357]  He just decided it was time to draw the line and clean up the corruption in the court.
[00:06:58.123 --> 00:07:17.940]  Well, we've seen the case in Pennsylvania and there's been other cases where it's admitted and judges have now been indicted for getting, what, two judges $2.6 million to take innocent kids and put them in a private juvenile lockup and the company that ran that was secretly paying the judges to put innocent people in jail.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:24.305]  So we know that Mr. Fine's case and this case in Pennsylvania and others are just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:07:24.827 --> 00:07:31.890]  Well, you really put it very well, because since the full disclosure started covering this, we had no idea how bad it was.
[00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:53.520]  It appears that the courts are the beneficiaries of many fees, and they gain money by the manner in which they handle the cases, whether it be child custody cases, whether it be environmental impact, but there is a monetary incentive for judges who benefit from the decisions they make.
[00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:55.494]  And there's no oversight.
[00:07:56.254 --> 00:08:03.579]  Although the presiding judges should be checking, there should be a checks and balances, but it's certainly not working here.
[00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:09.082]  And since we started doing this, people have been coming out of the woodwork to share other horror stories.
[00:08:09.662 --> 00:08:13.685]  And Mr. Fine has dug his heels in and said it's time to clean it up.
[00:08:15.777 --> 00:08:20.080]  Okay, I want to show people a document cam shot who are watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:44.098]  If you're a radio listener, you'll want to search the term, two judges plead guilty in sending kids to lock up, pair accused of taking $2.6 million in payoffs to put away young offenders, two Pennsylvania judges charged with taking millions of dollars in kickbacks to send youth offenders to privately run detention centers plead guilty to fraud Thursday in one of the most stunning cases of judicial corruption on record.
[00:08:45.595 --> 00:09:03.908]  The inside scoop I've got from former and current FBI federal marshals, especially here in Texas, most of these small towns, in fact I've seen it on CNN where they get the local judge on to admit, yeah I'm getting part of the money from what we take, and they just pull families over, take their wallets.
[00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:09.312]  So people hearing this are saying, you mean on record in L.A.
[00:09:09.372 --> 00:09:09.753]  County,
[00:09:11.189 --> 00:09:18.053]  The judges are getting money, and specifically in this case, how was this discovered and how much money?
[00:09:18.093 --> 00:09:26.098]  Because this isn't legal, obviously, and then somebody sues over it and they get locked up by the very judge who's in trouble.
[00:09:27.018 --> 00:09:34.003]  Well, the judges were, the courts were warned before they started giving the money illegally.
[00:09:34.523 --> 00:09:39.766]  The Attorney General wrote an opinion and sent it to the Superior Court, Court of the Court.
[00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:41.086]  We're good to go.
[00:09:49.707 --> 00:09:50.608]  Let me stop you again.
[00:09:50.648 --> 00:09:51.428]  Let me stop you again.
[00:09:51.488 --> 00:10:01.555]  This is like Philadelphia again, where the schools are given federally paid for laptops, they're watching the kids at home, and the schools are the one that told the public they were watching kids in their bedroom.
[00:10:01.575 --> 00:10:03.016]  In fact, let's pull that photo up.
[00:10:03.056 --> 00:10:13.022]  And my point is, tying this in, is that in one state you go to prison for this, and the Attorney General in California says this is illegal, and they just say we don't care.
[00:10:13.042 --> 00:10:15.704]  I mean, this is a new level of brazen corruption.
[00:10:16.297 --> 00:10:18.658]  Well, without a doubt, that's what it is.
[00:10:18.758 --> 00:10:20.699]  And here's the real kicker.
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:43.751]  When it became public that those payments were illegal after the Judicial Watch organization won their lawsuit challenging the payments, and the appellate court found them illegal, the Judicial Council went to Darrell Steinberg, the leader of the state legislature, and put through, very quietly, during the height of the budget crisis last year,
[00:10:44.398 --> 00:10:58.708]  A provision, a bill, Senate Bill SBX211, that gave the judges and the government officials involved in the illegal payment scheme retroactive criminal and civil immunity from prosecution.
[00:10:59.582 --> 00:11:05.563]  And to this day, no mainstream media in this state has reported that.
[00:11:05.824 --> 00:11:06.544]  Well, you know why?
[00:11:06.604 --> 00:11:13.585]  Because I guarantee you it's going on in every major city and many small towns, and they know this can bring their whole corrupt system down.
[00:11:13.665 --> 00:11:20.387]  So, well, why doesn't Pennsylvania just pass a law saying judges can be given $2.6 million under the table?
[00:11:20.487 --> 00:11:22.047]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:11:22.067 --> 00:11:26.048]  And as you said, there's almost a complete mainstream media blackout on this.
[00:11:26.068 --> 00:11:27.009]  That's true.
[00:11:27.329 --> 00:11:28.249]  But you know what, Alex?
[00:11:28.866 --> 00:11:29.907]  Not to despair.
[00:11:30.447 --> 00:11:31.268]  There is hope.
[00:11:31.548 --> 00:11:34.009]  Because judges are elected officials.
[00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:37.631]  And they have to stand for confirmation once they're appointed.
[00:11:38.032 --> 00:11:40.433]  They have to stand for confirmation every six years.
[00:11:40.813 --> 00:11:42.074]  And they can be voted out.
[00:11:42.555 --> 00:11:53.181]  And it's time that the people wake up and realize that the arrogance that's demonstrated here, that they have the power to control the legislature, the governor.
[00:11:53.661 --> 00:11:54.462]  They have the power.
[00:11:54.482 --> 00:11:56.123]  Well, look what happened with us.
[00:11:57.072 --> 00:12:05.734]  We tried for a year to get into the jail to interview Mr. Fine, to see how he was doing his health, because he is 70 years old.
[00:12:06.294 --> 00:12:13.695]  And the sheriff repeatedly denied us, but they let the LA Times come in and interview him.
[00:12:14.476 --> 00:12:21.197]  Of course, the LA Times report was very, very scant in detail, but we had to file a lawsuit
[00:12:21.653 --> 00:12:31.459]  To get access to speak with him and for you to see him on your website and hear his words.
[00:12:31.539 --> 00:12:37.622]  The Judicial Watch organization filed a lawsuit on our behalf and 30 days later the sheriff caved in.
[00:12:37.942 --> 00:12:43.005]  And I have to tell you, we really feel very grateful that we got that opportunity.
[00:12:43.085 --> 00:12:51.330]  Were it not for that, I really worry what would be happening to Mr. Fine right now and how many others there are in jail.
[00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:55.189]  Well, let me be clear.
[00:12:55.889 --> 00:13:00.873]  Judicial Watch, you judge a tree by its fruits, and they just continue to do a great job on so many fronts.
[00:13:01.493 --> 00:13:09.840]  It was Judicial Watch three years ago that sued and got the four-year documents that the government wouldn't release on the North American Union SPP meeting that I put in my film, Endgame.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.622]  So, folks really need to support Judicial Watch.
[00:13:12.662 --> 00:13:13.963]  I just continue, over the years,
[00:13:14.483 --> 00:13:17.604]  To see them do such important work, but I mean, that's a whole other issue.
[00:13:17.985 --> 00:13:27.969]  Not only is this corruption now just out in the open and being left alone, and there's this media blockade on it, but he's been in jail for more than a year on contempt.
[00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:39.654]  Potentially, I guess, if this precedent is set judicially, then you can have local judges putting people behind bars for their entire life without ever even having a trial.
[00:13:40.054 --> 00:14:06.168]  But what's really interesting is the fact that what they're doing is in violation of the Supreme Court precedent set in 1974 when the reporter William Farr of the Los Angeles Times was held in contempt and he was held for 47 days and he finally got to the Supreme Court with his appeal and the court held that since the penal code says that if you hold someone
[00:14:06.624 --> 00:14:09.887]  More than five days in coercive confinement.
[00:14:09.947 --> 00:14:12.949]  It becomes penal for civil contempt.
[00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.751]  And that they cannot do that.
[00:14:15.371 --> 00:14:22.897]  In Mr. Fine's case, every single court from all the way up to California through the U.S.
[00:14:23.057 --> 00:14:32.024]  District Court to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has ignored the Supreme Court precedent, including Justice Kennedy.
[00:14:32.785 --> 00:14:36.228]  Mr. Fine made a personal application to Justice Kennedy
[00:14:36.941 --> 00:14:45.113]  Asking him for a stay of execution, which is kind of ironic because he's never been convicted or tried or even charged with a crime.
[00:14:46.142 --> 00:14:50.627]  But Kennedy just summarily denied it without comment and without signature.
[00:15:07.395 --> 00:15:17.219]  It says right there that the president or his designates for any reason including intelligence gathering can arrest and interrogate and hold indefinitely U.S.
[00:15:17.259 --> 00:15:21.281]  citizens and that only an act of Congress can have them be released.
[00:15:21.661 --> 00:15:27.864]  I mean, so they're moving towards abolishing the writ of habeas corpus.
[00:15:27.884 --> 00:15:32.826]  It would appear that way, but this is what they're doing now, law or not.
[00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:34.447]  This is actual practice.
[00:15:36.564 --> 00:15:42.687]  Just like they spied on us for decades without warrants, then they got caught, they retroactively go have Congress pass a law.
[00:15:43.147 --> 00:15:43.607]  My God.
[00:15:44.208 --> 00:15:46.929]  Well, again, why was the judge so brazen?
[00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:54.753]  I mean, they had defeated his suit because of their corruption, and then now they wanted to punish him with $47,000.
[00:15:55.073 --> 00:15:58.634]  This is not the British system where in most cases you don't have to pay the...
[00:16:00.815 --> 00:16:04.176]  The attorney's fees, unless it's found to be frivolous, this clearly isn't.
[00:16:04.436 --> 00:16:07.317]  And the judge just says, that's it, go to the dungeon.
[00:16:07.657 --> 00:16:09.297]  Yes, well this is revenge.
[00:16:10.277 --> 00:16:11.857]  He has embarrassed the judges.
[00:16:11.957 --> 00:16:13.098]  He's exposed them.
[00:16:13.898 --> 00:16:19.639]  And they need to be exposed, really, because we have a right to know how the system works or doesn't work.
[00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:21.619]  But they don't like that.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.820]  And they have the power to do it.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.381]  And the other judges are apparently backing them up all the way to the Supreme Court.
[00:16:29.369 --> 00:16:30.670]  There is a glimmer of hope.
[00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:38.255]  The fact that Justice Ginsburg has scheduled this for the conference hearing on the 23rd is a good sign.
[00:16:38.335 --> 00:16:40.697]  It doesn't mean necessarily it's going to be heard.
[00:16:41.177 --> 00:16:45.980]  They will decide and vote as to whether or not they're going to take it up.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:54.806]  And some experts believe that there's a good chance that they will decide to do this because of the Supreme Court precedent in the Barr case
[00:16:55.387 --> 00:17:01.251]  And the underlying issue, which is corruption and bribes, being taken by the judges.
[00:17:02.892 --> 00:17:07.214]  And a quietly passed law giving them immunity from bribery.
[00:17:07.695 --> 00:17:10.156]  That has yet to be completely resolved.
[00:17:10.236 --> 00:17:14.619]  And let me tell you, once again, Judicial Watch is doing a yeoman's job.
[00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:24.325]  They are still fighting off continuing challenges from the superior court, trying to nullify the victory that they got.
[00:17:24.884 --> 00:17:26.885]  Uh, declaring those payments illegal.
[00:17:27.525 --> 00:17:32.207]  Uh, they're back in another, uh, appellate court hearing probably this July.
[00:17:32.687 --> 00:17:43.392]  And at that time, it is possible that the issue of the illegality of a retroactive law to bestow a criminal immunity on the judges could be thrown out.
[00:17:44.577 --> 00:17:47.058]  Okay, Leslie Dutton, amazing information.
[00:17:47.118 --> 00:17:47.578]  Stay there.
[00:17:47.658 --> 00:17:52.500]  Let's talk about how we get justice here because we all hang together or we hang separate.
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.821]  The foundation of our republic is habeas corpus.
[00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:58.782]  I mean, this is a total tyranny of the stands.
[00:17:59.142 --> 00:17:59.842]  None of us are safe.
[00:18:01.218 --> 00:18:01.538]  Fact.
[00:18:01.558 --> 00:18:03.120]  4 million people in the U.S.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.941]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:18:05.261 --> 00:18:05.602]  Fact.
[00:18:05.802 --> 00:18:09.145]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the 8th leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:18:09.485 --> 00:18:09.805]  Fact.
[00:18:10.086 --> 00:18:15.410]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:15.930]  Fact.
[00:18:15.951 --> 00:18:20.114]  1 in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:18:20.434 --> 00:18:20.775]  Fact.
[00:18:21.035 --> 00:18:24.718]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.981]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:07.385]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:19:07.625 --> 00:19:12.248]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:19:12.628 --> 00:19:13.029]  It's true.
[00:19:13.129 --> 00:19:17.672]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:19:18.212 --> 00:19:22.914]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:19:23.434 --> 00:19:30.357]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:19:30.537 --> 00:19:31.437]  And here's the best part.

[00:19:47.009 --> 00:19:49.012]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:19:49.772 --> 00:19:57.080]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.783]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:20:00.672 --> 00:20:03.854]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:20:04.215 --> 00:20:06.056]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:20:06.496 --> 00:20:06.916]  Don't!
[00:20:07.377 --> 00:20:10.399]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:20:10.819 --> 00:20:17.924]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:20:17.904 --> 00:20:19.585]  's number one debt secret.
[00:20:19.905 --> 00:20:23.568]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:20:23.968 --> 00:20:26.709]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:20:27.109 --> 00:20:34.071]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:20:34.411 --> 00:20:35.392]  Herb K was right.
[00:20:35.592 --> 00:20:38.633]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:20:38.813 --> 00:20:39.833]  What have you got to lose?
[00:20:40.233 --> 00:20:41.234]  Stop the calls now.
[00:20:41.514 --> 00:20:43.214]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:47.116]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[00:20:47.416 --> 00:20:47.836]  Call 800-822-1291.
[00:20:51.517 --> 00:20:51.818]  That's 800-822-1291.
[00:20:51.838 --> 00:20:51.878]  800-822-1291.
[00:21:06.007 --> 00:21:23.119]  Prosecutors in Pennsylvania described a scheme in which the judges shut down the county-owned juvenile detention center in 2002 and signed an agreement with PA Child Care LLC to send youth offenders to its new facility outside Wilkes-Barre.
[00:21:23.899 --> 00:21:28.903]  In exchange, they were paid under the table, the two judges, $2.6 million in the following five years.
[00:21:30.424 --> 00:21:30.664]  Again,
[00:21:32.366 --> 00:21:33.908]  And this is going on everywhere.
[00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:39.076]  And in California, they're just coming right out in the open with it and saying, yeah, we're going to get some cash.
[00:21:40.057 --> 00:21:42.040]  We're going to take cash for how we rule.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:42.822]  What's wrong with that?
[00:21:43.142 --> 00:21:44.744]  We got SWAT teams if you don't like it.
[00:21:44.965 --> 00:21:46.046]  We'll throw you in the jail.
[00:21:47.045 --> 00:21:52.468]  Now, if this is allowed to continue, because, I mean, again, in the past when this stuff would come out, people went to prison.
[00:21:52.988 --> 00:21:54.229]  Now, you expose it!
[00:21:54.609 --> 00:21:59.312]  You go to prison without a trial from the very judge that you're exposing.
[00:22:00.873 --> 00:22:04.014]  Leslie Dutton, what do we do to help Richard Fine?
[00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:04.775]  What do we do?
[00:22:04.795 --> 00:22:07.216]  I mean, obviously, get the word out about this.
[00:22:07.236 --> 00:22:08.457]  Have people visit your website.
[00:22:08.497 --> 00:22:09.758]  Get the videos out to people.
[00:22:09.778 --> 00:22:11.939]  You know, call the Supreme Court.
[00:22:11.999 --> 00:22:12.779]  Call the media.
[00:22:12.879 --> 00:22:14.520]  Ask them, why aren't you covering this more?
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.701]  None of us are safe.
[00:22:16.257 --> 00:22:21.679]  Well, there's something very specific they can do next Tuesday, and it's really important.
[00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:27.000]  There's going to be two rallies to support the Free Richard Fine Movement.
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:32.782]  And one is going to be in front of the Superior Court in Los Angeles at 8 o'clock in the morning.
[00:22:33.262 --> 00:22:36.323]  The other one's going to be held in front of the steps at the U.S.
[00:22:36.363 --> 00:22:37.183]  Supreme Court.
[00:22:37.923 --> 00:22:43.765]  And grassroots citizens are urged to turn out, bring a sign,
[00:22:44.852 --> 00:22:50.335]  And the one before the Supreme Court will start at 11 a.m.
[00:22:50.655 --> 00:22:52.556]  to 1 p.m.
[00:22:53.737 --> 00:23:07.383]  on the 20th and bring a sign and come down there and let's show the Supreme Court that you want Richard Fein to be free and that we want to reveal what is going on with our justice system and reform it.
[00:23:07.843 --> 00:23:12.746]  And the rally at the Los Angeles Superior Court will be in full view
[00:23:13.394 --> 00:23:14.534]  We're good to go.
[00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:39.532]  Well, this is so fundamental, I don't even have words to properly describe how important this is.
[00:23:39.612 --> 00:23:49.115]  I've studied the founding of our nation, the 15 years of tumult that led up to 1775, 1776, and the media always says it was about taxation.
[00:23:49.415 --> 00:23:52.597]  And the Stamp Act was part of it, the Tea Act, that was part of it.
[00:23:52.617 --> 00:23:56.018]  But the main reason, you read this in the Declaration of Independence, as Mr. Fine said,
[00:23:56.718 --> 00:24:02.670]  Was that they created these King's Courts outside of the courts that Englishmen in England had access to.
[00:24:03.051 --> 00:24:06.618]  Well, we no longer had access to it here in the colonies.
[00:24:07.854 --> 00:24:09.916]  And it was the same thing.
[00:24:10.016 --> 00:24:11.437]  Judges would take your property.
[00:24:11.477 --> 00:24:13.439]  They would take bribes.
[00:24:13.499 --> 00:24:17.363]  Anybody that stood up against them, they would order them arrested with no trial.
[00:24:17.803 --> 00:24:30.995]  They would transport them to other colonies or to England for kangaroo trials, special courts the king set up that Englishmen had fought in the Magna Carta and the Parliament Act.
[00:24:31.195 --> 00:24:33.037]  So it's the same thing repeating itself.
[00:24:33.457 --> 00:24:37.721]  This is what went on in Soviet Russia, and Communist China, and that El Castro's Cuba.
[00:24:38.021 --> 00:24:42.525]  We know tyranny, and this is just another serious red flag.
[00:24:42.545 --> 00:24:43.486]  The biggest I've seen.
[00:24:43.506 --> 00:24:48.951]  And it shows how evil our mainstream media is, pretty much blacking this out.
[00:24:49.451 --> 00:24:51.113]  And we're going to try to talk to Mr. Fine.
[00:24:52.033 --> 00:25:00.755]  Coming up for about 30 minutes in the last hour today, but Leslie Dutton's website is fulldisclosure.net.
[00:25:01.075 --> 00:25:14.497]  Thank you so much, and I want to thank one of our writers out in California, Cassandra Anderson, who first alerted us to this and wrote that article, 4infowars.com, that you helped put together, Leslie Dutton.
[00:25:14.517 --> 00:25:18.258]  But I salute you, spending your time and energy to defend justice.
[00:25:18.678 --> 00:25:20.179]  Well, let me ask a favor of you.
[00:25:20.219 --> 00:25:28.883]  When you talk with Mr. Fine, be sure and ask him what impact the judicial corruption has on the political process.
[00:25:29.423 --> 00:25:42.710]  Because if you think we'll have fair elections, and if you think that the judges can impact the way elections turn out, and whether or not we have a democratic process, he can tell you why we should be concerned.
[00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.290]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:47.532]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:25:54.292 --> 00:25:55.212]  Tyranny is here.
[00:25:55.572 --> 00:25:58.954]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:25:59.494 --> 00:26:01.715]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:26:01.895 --> 00:26:07.157]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:26:07.597 --> 00:26:13.819]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:19.820]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.901]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:26:24.401 --> 00:26:28.362]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:26:28.702 --> 00:26:34.543]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:26:34.643 --> 00:26:37.563]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:26:38.183 --> 00:26:39.644]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:26:40.164 --> 00:26:40.604]  It's here.

[00:26:53.386 --> 00:26:55.307]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:26:55.787 --> 00:26:58.688]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:27:01.008 --> 00:27:01.768]  Big Brother.
[00:27:06.437 --> 00:27:07.478]  Mainstream media.
[00:27:08.219 --> 00:27:09.320]  Government cover-ups.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.801]  You want answers?
[00:27:11.562 --> 00:27:12.503]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:13.103 --> 00:27:16.747]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:17.307 --> 00:27:21.371]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:33.413 --> 00:27:36.394]  Well, for the next hour, Bob Chapman is our guest.
[00:27:36.414 --> 00:27:41.336]  We're going to intersperse the interview on the economy with your calls, reports from the Tea Parties.
[00:27:41.816 --> 00:27:47.238]  Democratic operatives have been caught all over the nation with swastika signs saying they were with the Tea Parties.
[00:27:47.558 --> 00:27:50.819]  They were caught organizing it two weeks ago by us and others.
[00:27:50.959 --> 00:27:54.741]  AP broke it nationally in mainstream news on Monday.
[00:27:55.821 --> 00:27:57.222]  Just incredible dirty tricks.
[00:27:57.322 --> 00:28:00.803]  Simultaneously, Homeland Security is saying
[00:28:02.418 --> 00:28:04.680]  What we already knew internally they were training for.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:09.863]  Homegrown solo terrorist, as bad as Al Qaeda FBI chief says.
[00:28:09.923 --> 00:28:15.086]  So, focusing this apparatus in on the people of this nation.
[00:28:15.106 --> 00:28:17.828]  We're going to be covering that coming up.
[00:28:18.589 --> 00:28:21.291]  Again, Bob Chapman is our guest.
[00:28:21.631 --> 00:28:23.352]  The toll free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:28:23.372 --> 00:28:23.952]  Also want to comment,
[00:28:28.357 --> 00:28:36.145]  On the viral video experiment that we posted yesterday, iPad tortured to death in mass social experiment.
[00:28:36.545 --> 00:28:40.409]  If you go watch the video at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, it'll make sense.
[00:28:40.989 --> 00:28:42.691]  And my predictions came true.
[00:28:42.711 --> 00:28:47.336]  I'm here on YouTube hitting refresh, reading the comments.
[00:28:48.823 --> 00:28:53.045]  And it says things like, honestly don't care if America tortures a few terrorists.
[00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:58.848]  It may not be fair, but it's not fair when they hijack planes and use suicide bombs either.
[00:28:59.589 --> 00:29:05.852]  And there's people saying, because I show an iPad being torn into pieces by us.
[00:29:07.285 --> 00:29:14.952]  And I don't say why I'm doing it, and at the end I say, I did this because it's going to upset you because you love things, some people, more than humans.
[00:29:15.892 --> 00:29:22.678]  And you're not going to be upset about the kids being tortured, and people being tortured, and people being shot that we show clips of on this video.
[00:29:22.698 --> 00:29:25.901]  You're going to be upset about the iPod.
[00:29:25.981 --> 00:29:26.602]  Or iPad.
[00:29:26.782 --> 00:29:28.864]  And about a third of the people are so are.
[00:29:29.604 --> 00:29:31.406]  And I notice those that are mad about us
[00:29:32.796 --> 00:29:36.197]  ...destroying the iPad, because we didn't really torture it, it's not alive, it didn't feel it.
[00:29:37.878 --> 00:29:41.500]  They generally also comment, good, let's kill all the Arabs.
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:49.263]  What you don't know is, Hitler and others always pick an unpopular minority to test their systems out on, and it's designed for you.
[00:29:49.283 --> 00:29:55.606]  What we just covered with the case of judges putting people in jail that exposed them for taking payoffs.
[00:29:56.807 --> 00:29:59.730]  I mean, this is getting crazier and crazier, but it's important.
[00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.331]  This is on the front page of YouTube.
[00:30:02.032 --> 00:30:03.674]  I want to send it to the number one video.
[00:30:04.054 --> 00:30:15.225]  So go to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, get the video we have posted there, and send it to your entire email list, because this is really waking a lot of people up, and I'll explain why later.
[00:30:15.426 --> 00:30:16.627]  But I want to go ahead and go to Bob Chapman.
[00:30:16.667 --> 00:30:19.069]  Bob, when we come back, this is a short segment, as you know.
[00:30:20.413 --> 00:30:25.057]  I want to get into, like, where'd my CNN go?
[00:30:25.097 --> 00:30:25.457]  Here it is.
[00:30:25.897 --> 00:30:26.438]  CNN.
[00:30:26.958 --> 00:30:33.143]  SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission, charges Goldman Sachs with fraud.
[00:30:33.163 --> 00:30:34.104]  Here's USA Today.
[00:30:34.204 --> 00:30:34.404]  U.S.
[00:30:34.444 --> 00:30:36.806]  accuses Goldman Sachs of fraud.
[00:30:37.346 --> 00:30:38.027]  MSNBC.
[00:30:38.107 --> 00:30:38.327]  U.S.
[00:30:38.367 --> 00:30:40.508]  charges Goldman Sachs with civil fraud.
[00:30:40.528 --> 00:30:42.650]  It should be criminal fraud.
[00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:46.993]  And, of course, Bob has been saying this for, I don't know how long we've been interviewing Bob.
[00:30:47.033 --> 00:30:49.796]  It's got to be 10 years or 12 years or something now.
[00:30:50.656 --> 00:31:03.013]  And we had the McClatchy News reporter on who broke this three months ago, Greg Gordon, who got through lawsuits, these internal documents that are now causing all of this to unfold.
[00:31:03.033 --> 00:31:08.099]  So we're going to come back to Bob Chapman, have him comment on the dollar going down, gold skyrocketing.
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:15.202]  Uh, right now, uh, where he sees the economy, uh, going and what this means, uh, with Goldman Sachs.
[00:31:15.242 --> 00:31:25.545]  As we know, the SEC is famously corrupt, and much of the government's run by Goldman Sachs alumni, and this revolving door show how could this now be happening.
[00:31:25.765 --> 00:31:28.666]  This is what should happen, but not just civil, criminal.
[00:31:29.466 --> 00:31:31.707]  And this opens Goldman Sachs up to even more lawsuits.
[00:31:31.767 --> 00:31:33.808]  A flotilla have been launched in the last year and a half.
[00:31:34.608 --> 00:31:35.649]  But this needs to be criminal.
[00:31:35.709 --> 00:31:37.910]  But this does begin to open the door towards criminal.
[00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.671]  And justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[00:31:41.011 --> 00:31:42.412]  I'm just amazed this is even happening.
[00:31:43.312 --> 00:31:47.094]  But maybe they're using the investigation as a way to sweep up all the evidence and then cover it up.
[00:31:47.414 --> 00:31:48.534]  That's one of their favorite tricks.
[00:31:48.975 --> 00:31:51.496]  I don't know Bob's opinion on this, but I know I'm going to respect it.
[00:31:51.596 --> 00:31:52.456]  I respect his opinion.
[00:31:52.696 --> 00:31:54.217]  We'll get his take on it on the other side.
[00:31:54.597 --> 00:31:57.718]  I'm Alex Jones with PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[00:31:58.359 --> 00:31:58.779]  Stay with us.
[00:32:00.782 --> 00:32:03.385]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:03.786 --> 00:32:08.753]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:09.113 --> 00:32:10.835]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:10.855 --> 00:32:15.982]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:16.182 --> 00:32:17.123]  How much do you want?
[00:32:17.364 --> 00:32:18.085]  When do you want it?
[00:32:18.465 --> 00:32:20.067]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:20.348 --> 00:32:21.169]  When will you need it?
[00:32:21.429 --> 00:32:23.492]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:23.632 --> 00:32:24.734]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:24.974 --> 00:32:26.296]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:26.496 --> 00:32:31.563]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:31.763 --> 00:32:34.888]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:35.328 --> 00:32:38.831]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:39.151 --> 00:32:40.132]  How much will you need?
[00:32:40.372 --> 00:32:41.012]  We don't know.
[00:32:41.293 --> 00:32:42.193]  How much do you want?
[00:32:42.393 --> 00:32:43.134]  All you can get.
[00:32:43.314 --> 00:32:44.175]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:44.415 --> 00:32:47.177]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:47.477 --> 00:32:49.239]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:50.159]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:01.052]  What's your home worth?
[00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:03.153]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:33:03.334 --> 00:33:06.076]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:33:06.376 --> 00:33:13.862]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[00:33:59.508 --> 00:34:01.830]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:04.112]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:34:04.212 --> 00:34:06.954]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:34:07.415 --> 00:34:12.198]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:34:12.539 --> 00:34:16.742]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:34:17.062 --> 00:34:19.424]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:34:19.504 --> 00:34:21.926]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:34:21.946 --> 00:34:24.809]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:34:25.189 --> 00:34:32.798]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:34:33.138 --> 00:34:38.444]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:34:38.524 --> 00:34:40.806]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:34:40.846 --> 00:34:44.771]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:34:45.051 --> 00:34:45.972]  And I got news for you.
[00:34:46.132 --> 00:34:46.872]  You're everyone else.
[00:34:47.453 --> 00:34:48.453]  Invisible Empire.

[00:35:02.082 --> 00:35:08.106]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:35:08.727 --> 00:35:11.689]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:16.573 --> 00:35:20.776]  We are back live and now eight minutes into this third hour.
[00:35:20.796 --> 00:35:24.478]  Bob Chapman joins us once a week on Fridays.
[00:35:24.498 --> 00:35:25.939]  He's not going to be here the next two weeks though.
[00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:27.180]  He's taking a vacation.
[00:35:28.061 --> 00:35:30.162]  Certainly long overdue.
[00:35:30.182 --> 00:35:32.023]  I can't remember a time that Bob took off.
[00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:34.065]  Some weeks we don't have him on on Fridays because I take off.
[00:35:34.905 --> 00:35:44.691]  The International Forecaster, worked in military intelligence, then was one of the biggest private silver and gold brokers in the world, had the most popular newsletter until he retired.
[00:35:44.711 --> 00:35:48.493]  Then he came back in the last decade and has the internationalforecaster.com.
[00:35:48.933 --> 00:35:53.236]  And he's always targeted the SEC as a particularly criminal group of regulators.
[00:35:53.676 --> 00:36:01.580]  He's always targeted the brokerage and investment banks as Goldman Sachs, as being the tip-top of the pyramid of corruption.
[00:36:02.061 --> 00:36:02.521]  You look at
[00:36:04.417 --> 00:36:14.104]  You look at Chile, you look at New Zealand, you look at Greece, you look at Germany, you look at England, you look at almost every country I look at, it's Goldman Sachs runs the Treasury.
[00:36:14.144 --> 00:36:17.786]  Goldman Sachs is the President, or the Prime Minister, former Goldman Sachs.
[00:36:18.046 --> 00:36:20.468]  You've got the New York Fed, former Goldman Sachs.
[00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:23.570]  Now the Treasury Secretary, former Goldman Sachs.
[00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.551]  The last Treasury Secretary, former Goldman Sachs.
[00:36:25.992 --> 00:36:27.473]  SEC, full of Goldman Sachs.
[00:36:27.773 --> 00:36:30.775]  Five times the money, in fact the biggest contributor to Obama.
[00:36:31.155 --> 00:36:32.056]  Was Goldman Sachs.
[00:36:32.096 --> 00:36:34.016]  Five times the money they gave to McCain.
[00:36:34.477 --> 00:36:36.938]  Overall, four times with the Wall Street totals.
[00:36:37.238 --> 00:36:38.559]  We're not saying McCain was good, folks.
[00:36:38.579 --> 00:36:39.619]  The point is, he was the guy.
[00:36:40.259 --> 00:36:41.580]  And so how is this happening?
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.722]  SEC charges Goldman Sachs with fraud.
[00:36:44.762 --> 00:36:46.583]  That's CNN money.
[00:36:47.203 --> 00:36:47.423]  U.S.
[00:36:47.483 --> 00:36:48.904]  accuses Goldman Sachs of fraud.
[00:36:48.944 --> 00:36:50.184]  That's New York Times.
[00:36:50.785 --> 00:36:59.169]  And remember, about three and a half months ago, we had a big financial investigative journalist on from McClatchy Newspapers who got the internal emails from lawsuits.
[00:37:00.188 --> 00:37:01.149]  We're good.
[00:37:17.581 --> 00:37:29.847]  Uh, to investment funds, corporations, individuals, pension funds for fire, police, teachers, that's some of the biggest, knowing that they were going to bring it down and then make even more money and destroy their competition.
[00:37:29.887 --> 00:37:30.567]  That's in the emails.
[00:37:30.807 --> 00:37:42.593]  Then you separately have Geithner with Goldman Sachs and AIG, remember this came out three months ago as well, in emails through his board at the New York Fed telling
[00:37:43.593 --> 00:37:50.276]  Goldman Sachs, AIG, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and others do not tell the public where the money is going.
[00:37:50.696 --> 00:37:52.197]  And that is illegal as well.
[00:37:52.317 --> 00:37:53.497]  So it's just open and shut.
[00:37:53.917 --> 00:37:57.659]  But the other issue here is, I want Bob to really walk through all the facets, Bob.
[00:37:57.679 --> 00:38:01.000]  I'm going to try to shut up and let you roll with this for the rest of this segment.
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.381]  We're going to get into some other issues.
[00:38:03.061 --> 00:38:05.583]  But, why is the SEC doing this?
[00:38:05.623 --> 00:38:17.850]  I mean, this is, is this to sweep up, that's what my instincts tell me, because they've never done anything good, to sweep up all the evidence and investigation and then whitewash it before state grand juries indict, which we know there's movements towards.
[00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:21.071]  Well, you're right about the states.
[00:38:21.111 --> 00:38:27.235]  The AG in Connecticut moved on them in a similar manner, a civil manner.
[00:38:28.047 --> 00:38:42.593]  And I wrote about that, I guess it was three weeks ago, and I said to the subscribers, especially you who live in Connecticut, go to the AJ and ask him why he hasn't filed criminal charges.
[00:38:43.712 --> 00:38:49.516]  And then I saw a little bit later that the AG wants to run for the governor or something like that.
[00:38:50.097 --> 00:38:57.382]  So, you know, he wants to do something, but he doesn't want to get too much in the line of fire, so to speak.
[00:38:58.282 --> 00:39:01.545]  I've been going after the SEC for years.
[00:39:03.546 --> 00:39:10.451]  I started back in the early 80s, telling them of different scams that were going down.
[00:39:11.969 --> 00:39:13.590]  Eventually, they went after one of them.
[00:39:14.411 --> 00:39:15.591]  That was ten years later.
[00:39:15.731 --> 00:39:23.175]  And remember, for ten years, that other fellow, I forget his name, gave them complete dossiers on the Madoff scam, and they did nothing.
[00:39:24.436 --> 00:39:24.896]  That's right.
[00:39:25.437 --> 00:39:32.180]  And the reason they don't is the people in the SEC, first of all, answer to the government.
[00:39:33.161 --> 00:39:39.044]  And the government is controlled from behind the scenes by the large brokerage firms, in particular.
[00:39:40.143 --> 00:39:45.187]  And these people who work for the FCC, they work there five or seven, eight years.
[00:39:45.228 --> 00:39:46.869]  There's some exceptions, but not many.
[00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:58.799]  And then they'll contact the people who they've been overseeing from the agency, and they'll say, gee, I think I'd like to go to work for you.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:04.404]  And, of course, they've done nothing detrimental to these firms.
[00:40:05.285 --> 00:40:06.646]  And the firms say, well, sure.
[00:40:07.743 --> 00:40:16.570]  And the man's probably making $70,000 a year with the SEC, and he starts making $700,000 a year.
[00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:30.420]  And so this is sort of a conveyor belt from the SEC to the large firms, and that's a payoff to the SEC employees.
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.721]  For, uh, looking the other way.
[00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:43.304]  And you just cited, uh, the gentleman who, uh, has since wrote a book about how he went after the SEC for 10 years, and they wouldn't listen to him.
[00:40:44.184 --> 00:40:48.405]  Well, the reason why is this man was connected.
[00:40:49.266 --> 00:40:53.527]  And they may have well known that it was a CIA Mossad operation.
[00:40:53.547 --> 00:40:55.107]  Uh, I'm sure they did.
[00:40:55.768 --> 00:40:59.669]  And if you notice with the, uh, that affair of Madoff,
[00:41:00.414 --> 00:41:01.996]  Uh, the trial was closed.
[00:41:02.957 --> 00:41:09.924]  And the only people there were, uh, the, uh, clerks of the court, and the attorneys, and the judge.
[00:41:11.105 --> 00:41:15.229]  Uh, and no evidence ever came out, because there were hundreds of people involved in that thing.
[00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:22.637]  And so- Yeah, who's claiming this guy stole from $60 to $110 billion all by himself, and no one else knew?
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:28.962]  Well, it's just like the Lone Killer Theory, you know?
[00:41:29.663 --> 00:41:41.128]  But the SEC, it operates at the behest of the government and with the large firms, and that's why they don't get touched.
[00:41:41.188 --> 00:41:47.491]  And even if they do, even if the evidence is so blatant, they give them a fine.
[00:41:48.031 --> 00:41:50.072]  And the shareholders pay the fine, not them.
[00:41:50.513 --> 00:41:52.974]  And they go back doing the same thing the next day.
[00:41:54.521 --> 00:41:57.462]  They neither admit nor deny is the term.
[00:41:58.382 --> 00:42:01.063]  And I know I spent 28 years in the brokerage business.
[00:42:01.123 --> 00:42:01.963]  I own my own firm.
[00:42:02.903 --> 00:42:13.486]  And so what's happening here is the evidence is all, as you pointed out, through the Freedom of Information Act, McClatchy, the reporter.
[00:42:14.946 --> 00:42:19.887]  We have been writing about this, we'll call it an episode, for three years.
[00:42:21.408 --> 00:42:22.868]  And we didn't get very far.
[00:42:23.447 --> 00:42:32.750]  But evidently the attorneys for others who had bought this toxic waste that they were selling, they're going after them.
[00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:41.232]  And so the SEC was forced to act, and this is very important, they only act when they have to.
[00:42:42.652 --> 00:42:52.195]  So the overwhelming evidence is, let's see, as you said, Alex, if we can do as much whitewashing as we can, and we'll find them.
[00:42:52.911 --> 00:42:57.753]  Uh, probably maybe a billion dollars or something, and they'll go right on doing what they did before.
[00:42:58.994 --> 00:43:04.516]  Now, there's something going on here to the rest of Wall Street that's really disturbing.
[00:43:05.356 --> 00:43:06.797]  Because they're not all crooks.
[00:43:07.857 --> 00:43:13.960]  The people of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are crooks.
[00:43:15.301 --> 00:43:16.541]  Not all of them, but most of them.
[00:43:16.921 --> 00:43:17.722]  At the upper end.
[00:43:19.142 --> 00:43:20.923]  And I think
[00:43:21.872 --> 00:43:40.408]  The other people who were working on the street, as it's called, they're sick and tired of this relationship between Goldman Sachs and the Treasury Department, and the government in general, and the firm of JPMorgan Chase and their relationship with the Federal Reserve.
[00:43:40.828 --> 00:43:44.871]  And both Goldman and Morgan are owners of the Federal Reserve.
[00:43:45.632 --> 00:43:47.554]  Two of the largest owners, along with Citigroup.
[00:43:50.405 --> 00:43:57.629]  So what's going to happen here is they're going to try to smooth it over as much as possible because it's a bomb waiting to happen.
[00:43:58.089 --> 00:43:59.690]  Now, most people don't know it.
[00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:01.551]  I'm going to kind of go off to the side here.
[00:44:02.432 --> 00:44:11.477]  JPMorgan had a lot of records pulled by the FBI about a week ago.
[00:44:12.257 --> 00:44:13.518]  Most people don't know about it.
[00:44:14.658 --> 00:44:19.021]  One of my people in New York, you know, writes stuff and reports to me
[00:44:20.087 --> 00:44:21.627]  And he told me about it.
[00:44:21.988 --> 00:44:29.889]  He was the one, and incidentally, I announced the Madoff paper two weeks before they came down on him.
[00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:35.671]  I knew about it and I knew what was going to happen through this source that I have.
[00:44:37.011 --> 00:44:41.952]  And this source told me about the FBI going in and taking these records.
[00:44:42.532 --> 00:44:49.234]  The records from Morgan, JPMorgan Chase, that they took were in regard to Enron.
[00:44:50.197 --> 00:45:01.942]  And what they and CIBC and Goldman and a number of other bankers had done was set up offshore accounts for Enron where they would show profits that didn't exist.
[00:45:02.822 --> 00:45:04.683]  And that's what kept the scam going.
[00:45:05.543 --> 00:45:07.404]  And so now they're investigating that.
[00:45:08.124 --> 00:45:10.985]  Now, I don't think it'll go much of any way.
[00:45:11.005 --> 00:45:12.986]  You'll see it in the papers and they'll find them.
[00:45:13.546 --> 00:45:14.627]  Nobody ever goes to jail.
[00:45:16.287 --> 00:45:18.228]  None of the Illuminati goes to jail.
[00:45:38.599 --> 00:45:43.981]  They're in trouble for telling people to buy these derivatives when they knew they were planning to tank them.
[00:45:44.001 --> 00:45:49.002]  So, you know, at least this will educate people further about the fact that this is criminal.
[00:45:49.042 --> 00:45:52.803]  But as you said, they're civilly going after them, not criminally.
[00:45:53.804 --> 00:45:56.404]  Well, there's one more step in this.
[00:45:57.325 --> 00:46:08.128]  And it's a matter of public record that all of these bankers and brokerage houses all work very closely with the rating agencies.
[00:46:08.852 --> 00:46:13.155]  Moody's, S&P, and Fitch, but mostly S&P and Moody's.
[00:46:14.416 --> 00:46:33.650]  And they together, let's say Bank A and S&P, decided that this tranche of syndicated mortgages, bonds known as collateralized debt obligations, was AAA.
[00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:43.152]  It wasn't triple A, it was triple B. And then the insurance companies like AIG certified it, so another layer of fraud.
[00:46:44.013 --> 00:46:44.593]  Exactly.
[00:46:44.633 --> 00:46:48.455]  And then they dropped from a dollar down to five cents.
[00:46:49.035 --> 00:46:50.015]  All right, stay there Bob.
[00:46:50.075 --> 00:46:54.557]  Let's come back, finish up any comments on this thing and into other very important news.
[00:46:54.577 --> 00:46:55.437]  Get your take on that.
[00:46:55.837 --> 00:46:58.218]  And then the Lister's phone calls out there.
[00:46:58.638 --> 00:46:59.199]  It's Friday.
[00:46:59.219 --> 00:46:59.659]  Stay with us.
[00:47:00.279 --> 00:47:01.919]  Great news for pure water lovers!

[00:47:53.764 --> 00:48:02.730]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:04.991]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:48:05.011 --> 00:48:07.913]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:48:08.333 --> 00:48:13.096]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:48:13.436 --> 00:48:17.619]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:48:17.939 --> 00:48:20.262]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:48:20.282 --> 00:48:22.825]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:48:23.185 --> 00:48:25.748]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:48:26.088 --> 00:48:33.697]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:48:34.017 --> 00:48:39.301]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:48:39.401 --> 00:48:41.703]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:48:41.743 --> 00:48:45.706]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:48:45.946 --> 00:48:46.866]  And I got news for you.
[00:48:47.027 --> 00:48:48.328]  You're everyone else.
[00:48:48.368 --> 00:48:49.368]  Invisible Empire.

[00:48:59.759 --> 00:49:05.982]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:49:06.422 --> 00:49:14.205]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:49:14.545 --> 00:49:22.409]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:49:22.709 --> 00:49:27.471]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:49:27.791 --> 00:49:32.538]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:49:33.018 --> 00:49:36.883]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:49:37.384 --> 00:49:38.385]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:49:59.235 --> 00:50:04.979]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[00:50:05.059 --> 00:50:10.103]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:50:10.283 --> 00:50:12.945]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[00:50:13.146 --> 00:50:18.890]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.
[00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:27.975]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely.
[00:50:28.275 --> 00:50:35.759]  FPP, or fossilized phytoplankton powder, has been used worldwide for thousands of uses and is now available from Freshwater Organics.

[00:51:09.853 --> 00:51:15.916]  Bob, getting into the Tea Parties nationwide, you've got the Republicans taking them over, part of the establishment.
[00:51:15.956 --> 00:51:24.141]  You've got Ron Paul supporters that founded the Tea Parties three years ago being beat up at Republican events in Phoenix, thrown out, and they even ask questions.
[00:51:24.161 --> 00:51:26.502]  The police help the Tea Partiers beat them up.
[00:51:27.003 --> 00:51:30.645]  We've got the Democrats, finally in the Associated Press and major news,
[00:51:31.665 --> 00:51:35.989]  Showing up with Nazi signs, posing as Tea Partiers.
[00:51:36.009 --> 00:51:37.310]  They're attacking that angle.
[00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:43.835]  The media has advertised the only way to protest this takeover is the Tea Parties, and then they destroy that system.
[00:51:44.796 --> 00:51:51.140]  And now, on the heels of that, homegrown solo terrorists are as bad as Al-Qaeda, FBI chief warns.
[00:51:51.221 --> 00:52:00.408]  Al-Qaeda still aims to strike inside the United States, but homegrown or unaffiliated extremists now pose an equally serious threat, FBI Chief Robert Mueller warned.
[00:52:00.768 --> 00:52:01.028]  Yes.
[00:52:31.108 --> 00:52:38.090]  Anybody who doesn't like big government's a terrorist, and I believe they're going to stage terror attacks sooner rather than later to blame it on us and really have the big crackdown.
[00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:39.111]  What does Bob Chapman say?
[00:52:40.351 --> 00:52:41.411]  Four-pronged attack.
[00:52:41.971 --> 00:52:44.012]  Number one, to take over the Tea Party.
[00:52:44.472 --> 00:52:51.794]  Number two, to vilify them as the kind of things that are un-American.
[00:52:52.275 --> 00:52:56.176]  Number three, the police verifying that there are
[00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:57.589]  No.
[00:53:17.669 --> 00:53:20.231]  Uh, function and let the people know the truth.
[00:53:20.591 --> 00:53:23.293]  Well, the last one they've been very unsuccessful at.
[00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:27.997]  In fact, we're reaching more and more people every day, but that's the four pronged attack.
[00:53:28.637 --> 00:53:41.987]  Now, you know, I was with Ronald Reagan on his speaker's bureau in Los Angeles and the mid sixties when Ronnie first ran for governor and I traveled a lot with him and the minute
[00:53:43.624 --> 00:54:03.739]  In one of my speeches, Lynn Nossing, who represented the Rockefeller interest from the East Coast, who was running the program for Reagan for governor, the minute he found out I was very conservative, he had me thrown out.
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:09.584]  And it's this sort of thing, the infiltration
[00:54:10.607 --> 00:54:12.369]  And it's like that.
[00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:21.577]  And we're seeing it now with the Republican hierarchy moving in on the Tea Party people.
[00:54:22.457 --> 00:54:29.704]  And they're probably going to neutralize it from what you've just said and the events that are going on.
[00:54:29.744 --> 00:54:31.906]  And of course, you've got the crazies from the
[00:54:32.954 --> 00:54:42.920]  Democratic-Liberal side who are running around as imposters saying that they're Tea Party people and being dressed up as radicals such as Nazis.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:50.144]  And so they get this thing fully underway and we're going to see lots of it through the summer.
[00:54:51.024 --> 00:55:01.330]  And they're doing everything they can to try to keep these representatives and senators in the Senate and in Congress
[00:55:02.586 --> 00:55:09.670]  In order to continue to do the work of the people from behind the scenes, the Illuminists, because they got them all paid off.
[00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.551]  Exactly.
[00:55:10.571 --> 00:55:11.531]  Let me throw this in.
[00:55:11.631 --> 00:55:12.432]  Let me throw this in.
[00:55:12.752 --> 00:55:17.815]  You got Rand Paul and all the major polls at least 10 points ahead of the Democrat and Republican challenger.
[00:55:18.195 --> 00:55:26.180]  So the Republican Party's coming in and they're running somebody against him who is the head of elections, the Secretary of State.
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:30.163]  Uh, that's completely illegal and Ron Paul's been on the show and agrees.
[00:55:30.203 --> 00:55:31.765]  I mean, it's just, it's never before been done.
[00:55:31.785 --> 00:55:34.988]  Uh, I was reading in Texas state house elections.
[00:55:35.008 --> 00:55:39.172]  There's all these real Tea Party people who are beating old line Republicans.
[00:55:40.073 --> 00:55:44.597]  Uh, so now the Republicans are coming in going after real Tea Party people.
[00:55:44.637 --> 00:55:48.201]  So everywhere they're trying to target good patriots.
[00:55:48.621 --> 00:55:52.804]  That have a chance of taking us back at the state and federal level, which again just shows us.
[00:55:52.864 --> 00:56:03.210]  I mean, Newt Gingrich is running around, a total globalist, pushing carbon taxes, and he was being praised in Austin by the moron Tea Party group that was there yesterday.
[00:56:04.471 --> 00:56:09.254]  Well, you're going to find that because they don't know what we know, and they're not listening to us.
[00:56:09.914 --> 00:56:13.916]  They think in terms of political agenda, and it really doesn't work that way.
[00:56:13.956 --> 00:56:14.797]  And that's why so many
[00:56:15.447 --> 00:56:23.327]  People on radio and television, and especially newsletter writers, they can never get to the bottom of what's going on because they just don't understand.
[00:56:24.342 --> 00:56:25.402]  Look in California.
[00:56:25.442 --> 00:56:30.123]  I was on a Modesto the other day on a program that I do a couple of times a month.
[00:56:30.303 --> 00:56:31.003]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:56:31.023 --> 00:56:33.824]  Let's talk about that with Bob and go to your phone calls.
[00:56:33.884 --> 00:56:35.964]  And then I'm going to get into lawyers.
[00:56:36.044 --> 00:56:39.285]  Laptops took thousands of images of children in bed at home.
[00:56:39.605 --> 00:56:41.926]  It was part of the entertainment at the public school.
[00:56:42.246 --> 00:56:43.566]  This is going on nationwide.
[00:56:43.586 --> 00:56:46.727]  You better cover those cameras up on your laptops and iPads and iPhones.
[00:56:46.747 --> 00:56:48.567]  If you are being watched, we'll be right back.
[00:56:50.707 --> 00:56:51.588]  We're on the march.
[00:56:52.088 --> 00:56:53.588]  The empire's on the run.
[00:56:54.612 --> 00:56:57.291]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:00.046 --> 00:57:01.307]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:57:01.347 --> 00:57:06.690]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:11.552]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:57:11.953 --> 00:57:17.036]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:57:17.536 --> 00:57:22.238]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:57:22.759 --> 00:57:24.640]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:29.683]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:57:29.863 --> 00:57:30.764]  And here's the best part.
[00:57:30.984 --> 00:57:33.746]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:57:34.046 --> 00:57:37.349]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:57:37.669 --> 00:57:40.511]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:57:40.871 --> 00:57:42.752]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:57:43.092 --> 00:57:43.953]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:57:43.973 --> 00:57:44.173]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:57:44.213 --> 00:57:44.453]  Remember,
[00:57:52.799 --> 00:57:56.402]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:57:56.703 --> 00:57:59.165]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:57:59.805 --> 00:58:05.030]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:07.852]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:58:07.872 --> 00:58:12.356]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:58:13.217 --> 00:58:17.661]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[00:59:04.788 --> 00:59:06.509]  I guess I can go online to find a new one.
[00:59:06.949 --> 00:59:07.289]  Okay.

[01:00:07.173 --> 01:00:07.474]  Central.
[01:00:07.494 --> 01:00:08.637]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[01:00:08.678 --> 01:00:09.019]  Eastern.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.363]  We are here live.
[01:00:10.443 --> 01:00:11.246]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.261 --> 01:00:19.426]  We're getting great reviews for Invisible Empire, New Order Defined, our new film, 18 months in the making.
[01:00:19.446 --> 01:00:26.293]  You can order the super high quality DVD, been shipping out for the last three days at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:26.333 --> 01:00:35.322]  Two plus hour film, who the globalists are, their crimes, how they operate, how to stop them, a bunch of expanded extras, and it'll start shipping out
[01:00:36.445 --> 01:00:42.210]  Next Monday, it premieres on PrisonPlanet.tv on Wednesday, the 21st day of April, 2010.
[01:00:43.791 --> 01:00:46.313]  Police State 4, the rise of FEMA.
[01:00:46.673 --> 01:00:47.494]  Tyranny is here.
[01:00:47.574 --> 01:00:51.177]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:00:51.217 --> 01:00:56.762]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth, and it's only getting worse.
[01:00:57.122 --> 01:01:00.445]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:01:00.885 --> 01:01:03.247]  Veteran documentary filmmaker Alex Jones, that's me,
[01:01:03.647 --> 01:01:08.529]  Conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:01:08.889 --> 01:01:13.310]  The military industrial complex is transforming our once free nation to a giant prison camp.
[01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:19.332]  A cashless society control grid constructed in the name of fighting terrorism was actually built to enslave the American people.
[01:01:19.432 --> 01:01:26.615]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner is only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:01:27.375 --> 01:01:32.264]  This film exposes how the Continental Government Program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:01:32.525 --> 01:01:37.514]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, FEMA camps, and a shredded Constitution.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:46.462]  Witness police and military savagely attacking innocent civilians as our own government unleashes false flag operations to justify its oppression.
[01:01:46.922 --> 01:01:53.344]  Then watch Alex Jones and others as we take on corrupt mercenary police and expose mainstream media brainwashing.
[01:01:53.724 --> 01:01:54.924]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:01:55.084 --> 01:01:55.484]  It's here.
[01:01:55.504 --> 01:02:00.286]  We've got a new sneak peek up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:02:00.306 --> 01:02:01.386]  You can order the DVD now.
[01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:02.646]  It's basically not even pre-ordering.
[01:02:02.926 --> 01:02:05.547]  Start shipping out on Monday and Tuesday.
[01:02:06.187 --> 01:02:22.500]  A lot of you will be getting it on or before or right after the release date at PrisonPlanet.tv where you can download both these films or stream these films in high quality, burn them to regular CDs in DivX and other formats that play on most DVD players as an activist tool to get these out to everyone.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.781]  I'm asking you to take action.
[01:02:24.062 --> 01:02:30.587]  Look, when we get up here and we say we've had a massive effect because of you being activist, the proof is in the pudding.
[01:02:30.607 --> 01:02:31.748]  There's a huge awakening.
[01:02:32.919 --> 01:02:34.680]  World government is now admitted.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.400]  The people are starting to wake up every day.
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:46.403]  I can Google my name and see mainstream news articles and George Soros publications and the government lying about me, demonizing me, saying I'm dangerous.
[01:02:46.923 --> 01:02:50.524]  They're not doing that because we're weak.
[01:02:50.564 --> 01:02:55.045]  They're doing it because we're strong, we have the truth, we know their game plan, and they're scared.
[01:02:55.145 --> 01:02:55.345]  Listen.
[01:02:56.482 --> 01:03:09.888]  Gandhi said, before they brought the British down peacefully, back in the 1930s, they brought them down in the 50s, that first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[01:03:10.889 --> 01:03:15.791]  And I have been ignored, then I've been laughed at, now we're being attacked.
[01:03:16.721 --> 01:03:17.501]  What does that mean?
[01:03:17.521 --> 01:03:27.544]  I mean, Bob Chapman, when I get up here and say films are the equivalent of common sense, you know, in 1774, 1775, this is how people get their news and information.
[01:03:28.044 --> 01:03:30.785]  And these films have been seen by hundreds of millions of people.
[01:03:31.205 --> 01:03:37.746]  It's having a massive effect to the point of the Republican leadership is taking on our political coloration to try to fool people.
[01:03:37.786 --> 01:03:39.747]  I mean, this is the greatest compliment we could get, Bob.
[01:03:40.987 --> 01:03:42.008]  Well, you're right about that.
[01:03:42.288 --> 01:03:43.688]  And they're terrified.
[01:03:44.443 --> 01:03:47.644]  And it goes all the way down into the party ranks of both parties.
[01:03:48.284 --> 01:03:49.945]  Because they know what you represent.
[01:03:50.085 --> 01:03:54.566]  You're a threat to the scam that they're running, whatever that scam is.
[01:03:55.326 --> 01:03:57.567]  And all of these people have a scam, believe me.
[01:03:58.607 --> 01:04:05.389]  All the way from Wall Street down to the appointees and the bureaucrats and administrations.
[01:04:06.289 --> 01:04:12.491]  But, you know, the power of what you've been putting out
[01:04:13.144 --> 01:04:14.244]  Is immeasurable.
[01:04:15.025 --> 01:04:15.985]  Totally immeasurable.
[01:04:16.345 --> 01:04:32.871]  I get letters from all over the world via email, of course, and they all talk about you saying, well, I see what he's doing, and I've heard you on there, and this is wonderful, and I want to be a subscriber, and I'll never miss a Friday, and that sort of thing.
[01:04:32.931 --> 01:04:38.433]  So, we are penetrating, and the enemy is terrified, and they should be.
[01:04:39.333 --> 01:04:41.694]  And we're going to win, just like Gandhi said.
[01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:54.754]  Well, they've committed such outrageous crimes out in the open, and we're just here saying, don't destroy our freedom, don't destroy our country, don't destroy our way of life, and calling us unpatriotic isn't going to work.
[01:04:54.814 --> 01:05:01.596]  The media is so discredited, I don't think they realize that when they attack us, that just makes more people come see what we have to say.
[01:05:01.616 --> 01:05:04.817]  It certainly does, believe me.
[01:05:05.597 --> 01:05:06.477]  It certainly does.
[01:05:07.318 --> 01:05:08.898]  Bob, I want to go ahead.
[01:05:09.798 --> 01:05:10.759]  No, no, that's okay.
[01:05:11.772 --> 01:05:14.053]  I want to go to calls, but first, this.
[01:05:14.794 --> 01:05:15.994]  Again, I want this to hit people.
[01:05:16.014 --> 01:05:20.697]  I want people to really sit back and let this soak in and meditate on it for a moment.
[01:05:20.737 --> 01:05:21.238]  Think about it.
[01:05:22.738 --> 01:05:34.205]  In California, in Michigan, in Tennessee, in Texas, in Florida, in Pennsylvania, in Ohio, in New York, in New Jersey, in New Mexico, in Arizona, in Nevada.
[01:05:34.325 --> 01:05:35.966]  I mean, we can pull these articles up.
[01:05:36.006 --> 01:05:40.349]  We have where they put cameras in the showers
[01:05:41.502 --> 01:05:58.286]  And then a visiting team in one case, about eight years ago in Tennessee, the girls basketball team was taking a shower after the game and saw the cameras, they ran out screaming, the parents got mad, and the school said, well our school knows this, we openly announced this year we watch the girls and the boys naked and we videotape them, because there could be crime in the showers.
[01:05:58.446 --> 01:05:59.486]  This isn't a nice school.
[01:06:00.346 --> 01:06:04.587]  And that was a psychological warfare test, to just see if they can come out and say we're watching you in the showers.
[01:06:05.407 --> 01:06:07.429]  And I've seen case after case of this.
[01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:08.851]  Cameras in the bathrooms.
[01:06:08.891 --> 01:06:10.052]  Cameras in the stalls.
[01:06:10.372 --> 01:06:12.534]  Cameras in the stalls at roadway stops.
[01:06:12.575 --> 01:06:13.215]  You know, everywhere.
[01:06:13.756 --> 01:06:17.039]  And then it comes out because the school announces it a month ago.
[01:06:17.059 --> 01:06:19.722]  Oh, we're watching the kids at home.
[01:06:19.802 --> 01:06:21.023]  And we're watching their parents.
[01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:24.887]  And throw the photos up that have now been released by the court of kids
[01:06:25.948 --> 01:06:33.976]  Asleep in their beds and the school with the issued laptops and Google announced four years ago They're watching people at home now.
[01:06:35.738 --> 01:06:38.541]  I mean, it's so amazing and here's philly.com
[01:06:40.362 --> 01:06:41.603]  The Philadelphia Inquirer.
[01:06:42.044 --> 01:06:42.544]  Lawyers.
[01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:49.170]  Laptops took thousands of images and they've got emails from the schools saying this is the best soap opera ever.
[01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:52.874]  A staffer is quoted as saying in an email to the administrator running the program.
[01:06:52.994 --> 01:06:53.334]  I know.
[01:06:53.354 --> 01:06:53.955]  I love it.
[01:06:54.315 --> 01:06:55.676]  She is quoted as having replied.
[01:06:55.696 --> 01:06:56.917]  In fact, I forgot to give you the clip.
[01:06:56.997 --> 01:07:00.300]  Watson posted that front line before this ever came out.
[01:07:01.461 --> 01:07:07.385]  A year and a half ago, Frontline showed teachers watching kids over the laptops.
[01:07:07.885 --> 01:07:12.628]  I want to play that video because, you know, the issue is the media is acting like this is an isolated case, Bob.
[01:07:12.909 --> 01:07:21.894]  This is not isolated, but the magnitude of how out of control government is that they come out and announce, we're watching you at home.
[01:07:22.735 --> 01:07:25.917]  I mean, this is more than Orwellian, Bob Chapman.
[01:07:27.558 --> 01:07:29.439]  It's strictly perversion.
[01:07:31.357 --> 01:07:32.418]  Of one form or another.
[01:07:33.158 --> 01:07:34.599]  That's really the basis to it.
[01:07:35.559 --> 01:07:37.900]  I mean, children don't do anything when they're sleeping.
[01:07:38.961 --> 01:07:43.082]  People don't fondle people in showers, in bathrooms, at schools.
[01:07:44.523 --> 01:07:45.584]  I mean, I never saw it.
[01:07:45.864 --> 01:07:47.604]  But that's not even the issue!
[01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:54.608]  You're guilty until proven innocent, and the school is perving, is openly watching people.
[01:07:54.628 --> 01:07:58.870]  I mean, the police can't put a camera in your house without a warrant, but the school just does it.
[01:07:58.930 --> 01:07:59.450]  It's illegal!
[01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:01.410]  That's right.
[01:08:02.791 --> 01:08:12.877]  But they're watching, not because they're concerned about anybody, they're watching to see what these people are like, and they're perverts!
[01:08:15.519 --> 01:08:25.825]  I'm going to play a video clip from a year and a half ago, long before this even broke, of another school district on Frontline with them playing this like it's no big deal.
[01:08:27.426 --> 01:08:29.768]  Let's go ahead and play that video clip now.
[01:08:31.243 --> 01:08:35.205]  So I click, and there's an observe button, and it brings up their screen.
[01:08:36.666 --> 01:08:42.469]  The school's assistant principal spends part of each day remotely monitoring what the kids are doing on their laptops.
[01:08:43.029 --> 01:08:43.829]  We have a photo booth.
[01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:46.451]  He can see them, but they can't see him.
[01:08:46.991 --> 01:08:50.913]  These kids are goofing off, taking pictures of themselves in class.
[01:08:51.373 --> 01:08:53.174]  So wait, do all the kids have the cameras on?
[01:08:53.734 --> 01:08:54.995]  Sixth and seventh grade have cameras.
[01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:59.371]  A lot of kids are just on it to check their hair, do their makeup.
[01:08:59.952 --> 01:09:01.132]  They just use it like it's a mirror.
[01:09:01.152 --> 01:09:04.873]  I always like to mess with them and take a picture.
[01:09:07.474 --> 01:09:09.115]  Nine times out of ten, they duck out of the way.
[01:09:09.795 --> 01:09:11.776]  And then they shut down and they get right back to work.
[01:09:12.696 --> 01:09:15.317]  So, I can see he's got a few things going on in here.
[01:09:16.098 --> 01:09:17.918]  He's got the photo booth program open.
[01:09:18.759 --> 01:09:21.039]  He's got his social studies project open.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:22.320]  School email open.
[01:09:24.414 --> 01:09:29.836]  You know, I think the kids know what is expected of them, but they also want to do all their other things.
[01:09:30.477 --> 01:09:32.938]  That's what I see a lot of, is the multitasking.
[01:09:33.158 --> 01:09:35.239]  But I was doing my work, too.
[01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:40.261]  Most of the adults at the school actually seemed pretty sanguine about the kids being so easily distracted.
[01:09:40.501 --> 01:09:41.781]  You learn something new every day.
[01:09:44.463 --> 01:09:49.525]  Okay, so out in plain view, they train the children to be watched.
[01:09:49.605 --> 01:09:52.086]  Everything they do being photographed in the school.
[01:09:52.306 --> 01:09:54.027]  Now it's outside of the school.
[01:09:55.247 --> 01:09:56.328]  These are laboratories.
[01:09:56.348 --> 01:09:58.128]  They thumb scan to get school lunches.
[01:09:58.168 --> 01:09:59.669]  They're biometrically controlled.
[01:09:59.989 --> 01:10:00.689]  They're frisked.
[01:10:00.789 --> 01:10:01.390]  They're searched.
[01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:03.471]  This is prison training.
[01:10:03.911 --> 01:10:06.792]  This is the destruction of our free republic, Bob.
[01:10:08.012 --> 01:10:08.673]  It certainly is.
[01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:20.752]  It's the practice of continually watching people, and people become hardened to it, and they expect it as normal.
[01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:22.012]  And it's not normal.
[01:10:23.812 --> 01:10:34.474]  And so, in the social experiment, the government's been watching you at school, now they say we're watching you at home, the parents get upset, they haven't been conditioned enough to accept it, they file lawsuits.
[01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:36.435]  Again, it's all part of incrementalism.
[01:10:36.455 --> 01:10:36.835]  Do you agree?
[01:10:37.779 --> 01:10:38.480]  Absolutely.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.402]  Dialectic incrementalism.
[01:10:42.923 --> 01:10:43.904]  Let's take some calls.
[01:10:44.885 --> 01:10:46.626]  Let's talk to Brad in California.
[01:10:46.646 --> 01:10:49.368]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[01:10:49.388 --> 01:10:50.009]  Go ahead, Brad.
[01:10:50.989 --> 01:10:51.229]  Sweet.
[01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:53.211]  Hey, thanks, Alex, and thanks, Bob.
[01:10:54.052 --> 01:10:58.855]  This kind of is a little off topic, but I'll try to tie it into economics a little bit.
[01:10:59.336 --> 01:11:01.878]  I want to talk about soft kills, eugenics, and
[01:11:02.975 --> 01:11:06.018]  Vegetarianism, veganism, and low-fat diets.
[01:11:06.438 --> 01:11:08.681]  You can see how they're promoting that.
[01:11:08.761 --> 01:11:12.564]  The environmentalists are promoting veganism, vegetarianism.
[01:11:12.785 --> 01:11:15.707]  They're trying... Yeah, they admit they're going to put taxes on all meat.
[01:11:15.747 --> 01:11:17.009]  That's already started in Europe.
[01:11:17.609 --> 01:11:22.374]  And it's also shown that the brain doesn't develop as well without the fatty acids and things that are in meat.
[01:11:24.493 --> 01:11:31.716]  Well, that's actually true.
[01:11:31.836 --> 01:11:42.519]  Women that are on vegan diets, most of them have trouble having children, and their doctor won't even tell them why they can't have children, because if you're not getting enough protein, the body shuts down and won't let you be reproductive.
[01:11:43.592 --> 01:11:45.334]  Absolutely, and it makes people more docile.
[01:11:45.374 --> 01:12:05.632]  If you look at ancient tribes like Weston A. Price visited all these tribes throughout the world, people who tried to eat a traditional diet, high in fat, high in animal meats and blood and things like that, organs, they were strong, territorial, they held their ground, and people who ate more of a vegetarian style diet were docile, easily conquered.
[01:12:06.392 --> 01:12:09.733]  I just think it's amazing that some of the things that some of the listeners come up with and the intelligent
[01:12:26.547 --> 01:12:29.188]  Uh, coverage that they get out of it.
[01:12:29.608 --> 01:12:32.149]  I mean, I didn't know what this gentleman's talking about.
[01:12:32.289 --> 01:12:34.409]  You know, I had never read about it.
[01:12:34.949 --> 01:12:37.630]  And I thank you for calling in because I just learned something.
[01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:45.232]  And then the system infects the meat with poisons and antibiotics and garbage and then moves in to shut it down.
[01:12:46.012 --> 01:12:46.612]  It's incredible.
[01:12:46.652 --> 01:12:47.772]  Brad, I appreciate your call.
[01:12:48.092 --> 01:12:50.513]  Tracy in New Mexico, you're on the air.
[01:12:51.345 --> 01:12:52.467]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[01:12:52.848 --> 01:12:53.428]  Doing okay.
[01:12:54.029 --> 01:12:55.211]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[01:12:55.271 --> 01:12:58.336]  Hey, I was at the tea party yesterday in Albuquerque.
[01:12:59.406 --> 01:13:01.587]  Yes, for those that don't know, let me pull the article out.
[01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:05.868]  Guys, let's put the swastika photos on screen from the newspaper there.
[01:13:06.268 --> 01:13:11.990]  Democratic operatives running around with signs that said, Nazi youth for lower taxes.
[01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:16.631]  And we know groups nationally, this is in the AP Monday, pushed to do this.
[01:13:17.052 --> 01:13:22.833]  And this is similar to what the Congressional Black Caucus got caught a month ago doing, lying about the N-word and being spit on.
[01:13:22.853 --> 01:13:24.634]  Go ahead, you were there, what did you see?
[01:13:25.956 --> 01:13:27.762]  Well, I don't know.
[01:13:27.782 --> 01:13:30.249]  They must have been on the other side of the street or something.
[01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:32.114]  I didn't see anything like that.
[01:13:33.507 --> 01:13:36.289]  Everybody I saw had decent signs.
[01:13:36.729 --> 01:13:38.150]  Well, this was in Santa Fe.
[01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:38.711]  Where were you?
[01:13:38.731 --> 01:13:40.171]  Oh, I was in Albuquerque.
[01:13:40.271 --> 01:13:41.072]  Okay, different city.
[01:13:41.132 --> 01:13:41.612]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:13:42.053 --> 01:13:44.734]  Well, there were thousands of people out there.
[01:13:44.954 --> 01:13:48.717]  I got there about 3.30 and it was from 4 until 7.
[01:13:49.717 --> 01:13:53.339]  I left about 6 and I almost couldn't get out.
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:55.801]  I never saw so many people in one place.
[01:13:56.568 --> 01:14:05.894]  I handed out about 120 of your tapes and some of them to people with large church groups that swore that they were going to play them for their churches.
[01:14:06.154 --> 01:14:10.416]  A couple of biker groups, one had 100 in it and another had 120.
[01:14:10.977 --> 01:14:16.780]  I gave them five of your DVDs and they guaranteed me this whole group is going to watch them.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:24.004]  Some of the guys have been talking about getting them and making copies and passing them out too, so here's a great opportunity.
[01:14:25.585 --> 01:14:33.871]  Yeah, they're scared to death that the Patriots are going to take the Tea Parties back and use them as meeting groups to educate mainline Republicans.
[01:14:34.231 --> 01:14:40.575]  That's why all these Republican leaders have been demonizing us and others and saying they've got to keep us out of the Tea Parties.
[01:14:40.975 --> 01:14:43.317]  But wonderful, wonderful job that you did.
[01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:50.681]  I just saturated them with your tapes, and let me ask you, can you make a copy out of one of your copies?
[01:14:51.381 --> 01:14:51.681]  Yes.
[01:14:52.322 --> 01:14:54.742]  Okay, well that's what I told them to do, and they said they would.
[01:14:54.762 --> 01:14:55.523]  Of course!
[01:14:56.023 --> 01:14:57.563]  And they were tickled to death to get them.
[01:14:57.583 --> 01:15:06.466]  The ones that got them from me, there was only one lady that was a little smarter than everyone else, and said she thought she had all the information she needed about what was going on.
[01:15:07.567 --> 01:15:11.408]  And I checked her sign, it was okay, she seemed okay, she was just a smarty.
[01:15:12.597 --> 01:15:13.278]  So I went on.
[01:15:13.338 --> 01:15:15.999]  Everybody else was shaking my hand, thanking me.
[01:15:16.039 --> 01:15:17.380]  They were appreciative of it.
[01:15:17.761 --> 01:15:20.262]  Did you tell them that this will give them the full picture?
[01:15:20.843 --> 01:15:21.503]  Yes, I did.
[01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:25.726]  I told them that you know why you're here.
[01:15:25.746 --> 01:15:30.990]  If you watch these DVDs, you will know exactly why you're here.
[01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:34.873]  It will give you all the missing pieces that you don't have.
[01:15:34.893 --> 01:15:36.294]  And I know you don't have them all.
[01:15:36.314 --> 01:15:37.234]  No one does.
[01:15:37.655 --> 01:15:41.117]  But these DVDs will get you started on the right track.
[01:15:41.417 --> 01:15:41.938]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:42.598 --> 01:15:43.919]  Make copies if you can.
[01:15:43.979 --> 01:15:44.740]  Pass them out.
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:46.321]  Let your friends see them.
[01:15:46.761 --> 01:15:47.862]  Have some friends over.
[01:15:47.902 --> 01:15:51.544]  Tracy, it's what you're saying right now is what scares the globalists to death.
[01:15:51.584 --> 01:15:53.085]  Because you go wake people up.
[01:15:53.225 --> 01:15:54.486]  They wake other people up.
[01:15:54.786 --> 01:15:56.688]  The truth's only got to be applied once.
[01:15:57.128 --> 01:15:59.049]  Lies have to be applied over and over again.
[01:15:59.069 --> 01:16:02.111]  And we're having a devastating effect on these people.
[01:16:02.171 --> 01:16:02.732]  Bob Chapman.
[01:16:04.173 --> 01:16:04.653]  I agree.
[01:16:04.673 --> 01:16:07.275]  And it's too bad that
[01:16:08.519 --> 01:16:10.662]  He wasn't in the right city, unfortunately.
[01:16:10.702 --> 01:16:14.626]  He would have saw the antics of the Democratic operatives.
[01:16:15.187 --> 01:16:20.333]  And, you know, that's really foolish, because when you do things like that, you always get discouraged.
[01:16:21.475 --> 01:16:22.596]  And, you know, not discouraged.
[01:16:22.616 --> 01:16:23.998]  You always get discovered.
[01:16:24.658 --> 01:16:27.362]  And, you know, to do that is just really dumb.
[01:16:29.415 --> 01:16:30.015]  Absolutely.
[01:16:30.055 --> 01:16:31.156]  Well, Tracy, great job.
[01:16:31.176 --> 01:16:31.696]  Anything else?
[01:16:32.357 --> 01:16:36.359]  Oh, well, yeah, I just wanted to say that, you know, I hope it works.
[01:16:36.739 --> 01:16:39.081]  I hope they do what they say they were going to.
[01:16:39.101 --> 01:16:48.526]  This one biker, he saw me with my bag on the ground, sifting through, you know, I had them all separated out in different baggies, and he said, hey, man,
[01:16:49.028 --> 01:16:59.772]  Get that up off the ground, set it on my saddlebag here on this big Harley and had me lean my cane up there and he said, you, whenever you're around here, you put that up here and work out of here.
[01:16:59.832 --> 01:17:01.533]  Don't you big bend over, stand up.
[01:17:02.533 --> 01:17:10.556]  So everybody was very nice, very appreciative of getting these DVDs and they were chomping at the bit to get home and see them.
[01:17:11.456 --> 01:17:12.297]  Awesome, Tracy.
[01:17:12.657 --> 01:17:14.057]  And again, I keep going back to this.
[01:17:14.077 --> 01:17:14.918]  We're not hyping this.
[01:17:14.978 --> 01:17:15.578]  It's the truth.
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:18.801]  We are hurting the New World Order.
[01:17:18.902 --> 01:17:19.922]  We have the truth.
[01:17:20.423 --> 01:17:27.087]  And as the founder of the Texas Rangers said, a man in the wrong can't stand up against a man in the right who keeps on a coming.
[01:17:27.528 --> 01:17:29.489]  And we just gotta keep on a coming, don't we Bob?
[01:17:30.490 --> 01:17:31.451]  You better believe it.
[01:17:32.011 --> 01:17:37.855]  You have to have the perseverance to not let the SOBs get you down.
[01:17:40.917 --> 01:17:42.038]  That'd be a good bumper sticker.
[01:17:42.058 --> 01:17:44.100]  Don't let the SOBs get you down.
[01:17:46.766 --> 01:17:48.447]  In fact, that's what Hutton Gibson would always say to me.
[01:17:48.487 --> 01:17:49.367]  I need to call him up.
[01:17:49.387 --> 01:17:51.768]  Boy, he's got to be like 86, 87 now.
[01:17:52.788 --> 01:17:55.869]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with more of your calls.
[01:17:56.710 --> 01:17:59.311]  Bob, Mark, Irwin, and others.
[01:17:59.331 --> 01:17:59.831]  Stay with us.

[01:18:48.863 --> 01:18:49.404]  That's 1-877-552-5206.
[01:18:49.544 --> 01:18:50.224]  Maxfit Gloves.
[01:18:50.364 --> 01:18:52.566]  Incredible grip in any conditions.
[01:19:00.038 --> 01:19:02.340]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:04.643]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:19:04.743 --> 01:19:07.545]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:19:07.966 --> 01:19:12.710]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:19:13.071 --> 01:19:17.275]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:19:17.575 --> 01:19:19.896]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:19:19.916 --> 01:19:22.457]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:19:22.797 --> 01:19:25.378]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:33.302]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:19:33.642 --> 01:19:38.943]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:19:39.023 --> 01:19:41.844]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:19:41.884 --> 01:19:45.325]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:19:45.565 --> 01:19:46.485]  And I got news for you.
[01:19:46.645 --> 01:19:47.966]  You're everyone else.
[01:19:47.986 --> 01:19:49.006]  Invisible Empire.

[01:20:09.522 --> 01:20:10.082]  We're good to go.
[01:20:34.053 --> 01:20:34.253]  Thank you.
[01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:13.595]  Final hour coming up.
[01:21:14.216 --> 01:21:22.544]  Your phone calls a guest joining us from prison if he's able to get through being held in violation of habeas corpus for exposing payoffs to judges.
[01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:25.806]  And this is even starting to get into the mainstream news.
[01:21:26.647 --> 01:21:38.053]  It dovetails, for those that can't believe this is going on, two judges plead guilty to sending kids to lockup, pair accused of taking 2.6 million in payoffs to put away innocent young offenders.
[01:21:39.488 --> 01:21:48.610]  You know, the way Dr. Frederick Weinherz, former head of the FBI Crime Lab, put it a few weeks ago here on the show, Bob Chapman was, he thinks in a way things are getting better.
[01:21:48.630 --> 01:21:49.350]  He agrees with us.
[01:21:49.730 --> 01:22:01.913]  It's just because of the internet and people not being as naive, we're now finding out just how evil many levels of state, local, and federal, and international government are, and that things are actually getting better.
[01:22:01.953 --> 01:22:03.573]  We're just discovering how bad things are.
[01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:05.813]  Well, you're right.
[01:22:05.994 --> 01:22:07.974]  You know, that situation in L.A.
[01:22:09.257 --> 01:22:17.740]  I lived there for 36 years, and a very good friend of mine was one of the top people in the district attorney's office.
[01:22:18.861 --> 01:22:29.484]  In fact, he was very good friends with Johnny Cochran, who is now deceased, who represented OJ Simpson in his trial, the murder trial.
[01:22:32.285 --> 01:22:36.447]  I knew that this was going on for years, and everybody would just turn their head.
[01:22:37.598 --> 01:22:53.970]  And one of the things that I found that really disturbed me were a lot of these judges, federal and superior court judges, people of stature, were alcoholics, drug addicts, and perverts.
[01:22:54.871 --> 01:22:56.512]  I was really shocked.
[01:22:58.254 --> 01:23:04.158]  And that enters into their, you know, payoffs and things that they're doing within that L.A.
[01:23:04.238 --> 01:23:05.099]  County system.
[01:23:05.868 --> 01:23:08.049]  And so I've known for years how rotten it is.
[01:23:10.069 --> 01:23:11.550]  Let's talk to Rob in Florida.
[01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:12.450]  You're on the air, Rob.
[01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.930]  Go ahead.
[01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:16.031]  Alex, thank you very much for taking my call.
[01:23:16.351 --> 01:23:17.111]  My name is Rob Tulp.
[01:23:17.331 --> 01:23:22.973]  I am giving a report a little bit on the Tea Party movement here yesterday in Collier County, Florida.
[01:23:23.033 --> 01:23:24.934]  We had a phenomenal turnout.
[01:23:25.234 --> 01:23:30.255]  I am a candidate for the Constitution Party running for Collier County Commissioner District 2.
[01:23:30.575 --> 01:23:33.076]  We have five different districts, so five different commissioners.
[01:23:33.935 --> 01:23:36.656]  And a phenomenal turnout yesterday.
[01:23:36.676 --> 01:23:48.702]  I was able to speak publicly to the crowd that was gathered and I had one individual, a local businessman, who just entered the gubernatorial race for Florida only just a couple of days ago.
[01:23:49.582 --> 01:23:53.584]  I myself only joined the race for Collier County Commission a week and a half ago.
[01:23:53.604 --> 01:24:02.288]  And whether you win or lose, you win because you get the issues out there, just like Ron Paul did and lost, but now his message is a thousand times bigger.
[01:24:03.257 --> 01:24:03.857]  Exactly.
[01:24:04.438 --> 01:24:18.064]  And I was able to speak to the crowd that was gathered for about two to three minutes, and I pointed out the fact that both Democrats and Republicans have been sold down the road and disenfranchised by both their parties by pointing out that Bush doubled the size of government in his term.
[01:24:18.664 --> 01:24:24.547]  And that Obama at least doubled the size of government in his first year of office.
[01:24:25.088 --> 01:24:35.414]  And I said it is time for people in the local government to go back to using the Constitution as our guiding principle on what legislation we enact and which we refuse.
[01:24:36.014 --> 01:24:46.540]  And when I spoke this, even though one of my opponents spoke and the candidate for the gubernatorial race spoke, the crowd erupted in it.
[01:24:47.498 --> 01:24:54.100]  Incredible applause when I said that it is time for a new party that will actually represent the American people.
[01:24:54.180 --> 01:25:03.703]  Absolutely, and the Republicans are staking their fortune on the Tea Party taking it over, and we're going to end up the same place we are now, or worse, once they get back in.
[01:25:03.743 --> 01:25:06.924]  We have to fundamentally discredit this entire criminal system.
[01:25:06.944 --> 01:25:08.204]  I appreciate your call, Rob.
[01:25:08.605 --> 01:25:09.705]  That's a great report.
[01:25:09.725 --> 01:25:13.186]  Let's throw that comment by the Texas Ranger back there up on screen.
[01:25:13.206 --> 01:25:16.027]  This makes me think of Ron Paul in his 30-plus years.
[01:25:16.527 --> 01:25:16.727]  Thank you.
[01:25:16.747 --> 01:25:17.007]  Thanks.
[01:25:40.398 --> 01:25:45.500]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:49.401]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:25:50.541 --> 01:25:53.142]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:25:53.562 --> 01:25:58.503]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:25:58.883 --> 01:26:00.624]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:26:00.924 --> 01:26:05.745]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:26:05.925 --> 01:26:06.886]  How much do you want?
[01:26:07.106 --> 01:26:07.846]  When do you want it?
[01:26:08.226 --> 01:26:09.828]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:26:10.109 --> 01:26:10.930]  When will you need it?
[01:26:11.190 --> 01:26:13.253]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:26:13.393 --> 01:26:14.495]  Will there be any food?
[01:26:14.735 --> 01:26:16.077]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:26:16.257 --> 01:26:21.324]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:26:21.544 --> 01:26:24.669]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:26:25.089 --> 01:26:28.612]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:26:28.912 --> 01:26:29.913]  How much will you need?
[01:26:30.153 --> 01:26:30.774]  We don't know.
[01:26:31.054 --> 01:26:31.975]  How much do you want?
[01:26:32.155 --> 01:26:32.875]  All you can get.
[01:26:32.895 --> 01:26:33.936]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:26:34.176 --> 01:26:36.939]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:26:37.239 --> 01:26:39.401]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:26:39.421 --> 01:26:40.441]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:26:52.995 --> 01:26:54.918]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:55.399 --> 01:26:58.162]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:27:09.665 --> 01:27:11.166]  We'll see if he can get through.
[01:27:11.227 --> 01:27:17.352]  Sheriff Baca for the last year has not allowed Richard Fine to do any interviews until Judicial Watch sued.
[01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:21.296]  And finally he's done a video interview, jailhouse interview.
[01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:27.962]  He's being held without habeas corpus for exposing judges taking money for rulings.
[01:27:27.982 --> 01:27:33.987]  I mean this is incredible and it dovetails again with two judges plead guilty and sending kids to lockup.
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:42.083]  The pair admit they took 2.6 million in payoff to put away innocent young offenders that were paid off by the private prison facility.
[01:27:42.823 --> 01:27:47.345]  We'll see if he's able to get through on the line with us for a 15-20 minute interview.
[01:27:47.405 --> 01:27:51.347]  I've got a bunch of news that I haven't even gotten into yet.
[01:27:51.947 --> 01:27:55.049]  But right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:57.530]  Erwin in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:27:57.630 --> 01:27:58.270]  Thanks for holding.
[01:27:59.002 --> 01:27:59.743]  Yes.
[01:27:59.803 --> 01:28:01.164]  Congratulations, Alex.
[01:28:01.244 --> 01:28:05.548]  I'm listening as much as I can every day, and I see you're making progress.
[01:28:06.168 --> 01:28:07.669]  We're making progress together, sir.
[01:28:07.709 --> 01:28:08.230]  God bless you.
[01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:08.910]  What's on your mind?
[01:28:10.011 --> 01:28:16.196]  I have a suggestion, and I think this is absolutely most important, considering biblical principles.
[01:28:17.117 --> 01:28:20.900]  A good biblical principle for healing is forgiveness.
[01:28:22.256 --> 01:28:23.897]  And I want to tell you a little story.
[01:28:23.977 --> 01:28:24.837]  I come from Germany.
[01:28:24.917 --> 01:28:30.398]  I was 18 years old when they came to Canada, and I was told here I was a Nazi.
[01:28:31.279 --> 01:28:33.119]  I didn't even know what that really was.
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:38.901]  My parents were never involved in the National Socialistic Party with Hitler.
[01:28:38.941 --> 01:28:43.402]  They opposed Hitler to the point where they were afraid to be jailed.
[01:28:44.223 --> 01:28:48.944]  If we wouldn't have been nine children at home, my dad would have been jailed.
[01:28:49.713 --> 01:28:51.534]  So you can see where I come from.
[01:28:51.554 --> 01:28:53.454]  Let me say this, it's going to be the same thing.
[01:28:53.474 --> 01:28:57.115]  Americans now go to other countries and are hated because of the torture.
[01:28:57.636 --> 01:29:02.697]  Even though as Americans we've been speaking out against it and fighting against it, we still get the blame for it.
[01:29:03.017 --> 01:29:05.858]  And America is now known as an engine of evil worldwide.
[01:29:05.898 --> 01:29:06.859]  More and more we are.
[01:29:07.519 --> 01:29:10.460]  And when we're brought to justice, we're all going to be blamed for it.
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:11.180]  Yes.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.900]  And this is my suggestion.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.481]  And I think it's most important.
[01:29:14.621 --> 01:29:16.021]  It is a biblical principle.
[01:29:16.862 --> 01:29:17.402]  And that is,
[01:29:18.075 --> 01:29:40.896]  You have the credibility to, on behalf of the American people, publicly, to apologize to the German people for having vilified and identified the German people with Hitler, even though Hitler, by hook and crook, was voted in to the Chancellery by only 32% of the public
[01:29:44.755 --> 01:29:45.575]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:29:45.635 --> 01:29:47.996]  I mean, I've exposed that and I've talked about that.
[01:29:48.416 --> 01:29:54.579]  I wasn't alive then, and so I don't think it would be proper for me to sit there and apologize.
[01:29:54.619 --> 01:29:56.200]  I think it's all part of information.
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:05.524]  I mean, I have apologized for the torture of children and for the fact that we're under mind control in this country and so many people support it.
[01:30:05.844 --> 01:30:10.606]  And I see them in the YouTube comments on our iPod video, people just praising the death of children.
[01:30:10.626 --> 01:30:11.787]  It's totally sick.
[01:30:12.969 --> 01:30:13.799]  But, um...
[01:30:15.467 --> 01:30:16.728]  Again, that's stereotypes.
[01:30:16.808 --> 01:30:18.528]  It's like, imagine how the Arabs feel.
[01:30:18.828 --> 01:30:20.529]  Or people with brown skin from the Middle East.
[01:30:21.009 --> 01:30:23.550]  I mean, the Middle East, on average, is over 20% Christian.
[01:30:24.430 --> 01:30:28.212]  And, you know, Christians take Sikhs from India.
[01:30:28.572 --> 01:30:29.972]  They have nothing to do with Muslims.
[01:30:30.012 --> 01:30:31.593]  And I'm not bashing Muslims here either.
[01:30:31.633 --> 01:30:32.493]  They have nothing to do with Muslims.
[01:30:33.014 --> 01:30:44.118]  And last time I saw it was over 30-plus in the last six, seven years, eight years, since 9-11, that people walk into gas stations or liquor stores or hotels and shoot Sikhs.
[01:30:44.838 --> 01:30:51.365]  Because they're wearing turbans on their head, part of their religion to have long hair and not cut their hair.
[01:30:51.385 --> 01:30:59.052]  Do I apologize to the Sikhs for government propaganda that makes crazy people go shoot them?
[01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:11.056]  Really study geopolitical systems and cultural systems before they make judgments.
[01:31:11.576 --> 01:31:28.650]  I'm seeing the comments right now on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and on this YouTube video, the psychological experiment I did yesterday, iPad torture to death and mass social experiment, and there they are under it, attacking me for destroying an iPad because they only care about things.
[01:31:29.711 --> 01:31:38.034]  And saying, uh, under it, uh, that, uh, you know, it's wonderful to kill children, all the Muslims are going to grow up to be terrorists, so it's a good thing.
[01:31:38.634 --> 01:31:41.755]  Kids are, you know, shot up by the gunship.
[01:31:42.255 --> 01:31:43.895]  And it's just commenter after commenter.
[01:31:43.915 --> 01:31:44.916]  And these are real commenters.
[01:31:44.956 --> 01:31:47.517]  You can go to their, their own YouTube pages and see them.
[01:31:48.017 --> 01:31:50.778]  And, and, and these are the people that end up being our government leaders.
[01:31:50.818 --> 01:31:54.239]  They're the ones that end up holding the trudgeon that slams into our head.
[01:31:54.859 --> 01:31:57.139]  Uh, so, I don't know if I need to apologize.
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:31:58.420]  I've been doing the best job I can.
[01:31:59.087 --> 01:31:59.807]  I have the guilt for this.
[01:31:59.987 --> 01:32:01.228]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:01.268 --> 01:32:06.609]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:11.471]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:11.871 --> 01:32:16.913]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:32:17.453 --> 01:32:22.156]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:22.677 --> 01:32:24.598]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:32:24.998 --> 01:32:29.601]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:29.781 --> 01:32:30.682]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:30.902 --> 01:32:33.684]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:32:33.964 --> 01:32:37.266]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:37.607 --> 01:32:40.449]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:32:40.789 --> 01:32:42.690]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:43.931]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:47.574 --> 01:32:51.298]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:51.799 --> 01:32:56.325]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:56.645 --> 01:32:59.029]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:01.499 --> 01:33:05.120]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:13.582]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:33:14.303 --> 01:33:18.344]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:33:18.944 --> 01:33:29.747]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:33:30.387 --> 01:33:39.390]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:44.951]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:33:45.331 --> 01:33:52.493]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:33:52.813 --> 01:33:55.214]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:34:01.395 --> 01:34:02.716]  You're subject to other police action.
[01:34:03.536 --> 01:34:04.437]  Tyranny is here.
[01:34:04.797 --> 01:34:08.559]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:34:08.739 --> 01:34:10.941]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:34:10.981 --> 01:34:16.364]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:34:16.824 --> 01:34:23.069]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:34:23.509 --> 01:34:29.013]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:34:29.473 --> 01:34:33.136]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:34:33.636 --> 01:34:37.619]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:34:37.939 --> 01:34:43.863]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:34:43.883 --> 01:34:46.785]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:34:47.445 --> 01:34:48.886]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:34:49.406 --> 01:34:49.887]  It's here.

[01:35:00.831 --> 01:35:03.033]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:35:03.593 --> 01:35:06.455]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:09.337 --> 01:35:10.218]  Okay, um...
[01:35:11.141 --> 01:35:15.823]  The guests that we were going to have on, we're able to take collect calls here at our office.
[01:35:16.443 --> 01:35:19.765]  He rang through twice and then it said we're unable to accept collect calls.
[01:35:19.805 --> 01:35:22.426]  So strange things happening with the phone system.
[01:35:23.386 --> 01:35:26.367]  But we are working on getting Richard Fine on.
[01:35:26.407 --> 01:35:27.708]  Held for over a year in L.A.
[01:35:27.748 --> 01:35:28.788]  County Jail.
[01:35:30.029 --> 01:35:32.010]  But regardless, we'll get him on next week.
[01:35:32.050 --> 01:35:33.510]  We're unable to today.
[01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:34.971]  We have to get him a calling card.
[01:35:35.931 --> 01:35:39.373]  But earlier in the hour before last, we had one of the
[01:35:41.027 --> 01:35:41.367]  I don't know.
[01:36:11.567 --> 01:36:13.948]  No, when you expose it, you go to jail.
[01:36:14.028 --> 01:36:20.449]  No jury, no nothing, the judge who's being accused, and the evidence is there, it's admitted they did this, they send you to jail.
[01:36:21.169 --> 01:36:22.870]  And that's the essence of a tyranny.
[01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:28.431]  The essence of oppression is when there's no charges, no nothing, you just go to jail.
[01:36:28.911 --> 01:36:29.711]  And then you never get out.
[01:36:30.752 --> 01:36:31.572]  Because they don't like you.
[01:36:32.632 --> 01:36:34.753]  Let's talk to Debbie in California.
[01:36:34.793 --> 01:36:36.053]  Debbie, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:36:36.793 --> 01:36:40.134]  Hi Alex, I wanted to ask Bob about Silver, but since he's gone I'm going to report.
[01:36:41.152 --> 01:36:43.534]  About the Napa, California Tea Party.
[01:36:44.135 --> 01:36:48.860]  I basically got a death threat from someone because I was saying I was not into killing people in war.
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:51.562]  He said, um, I'd like to kill you.
[01:36:51.782 --> 01:36:52.503]  That was a bummer.
[01:36:53.444 --> 01:36:59.310]  Oh yeah, these war lovers, these war lovers think that all the Iraqis are dehumanized and they love the elite.
[01:36:59.590 --> 01:37:02.873]  They don't understand the elite see them as just as worthless as the Iraqis.
[01:37:03.414 --> 01:37:04.715]  I know, it's just unbelievable.
[01:37:08.616 --> 01:37:08.937]  That's right.
[01:37:17.421 --> 01:37:22.283]  Um, there was a guy, there was a bullhorn saying, pay your taxes, pay your taxes.
[01:37:22.303 --> 01:37:24.804]  He was telling the SDS group to get a job.
[01:37:25.104 --> 01:37:29.066]  Oh, we've got videos from across the country of them chanting, your taxes have been cut.
[01:37:29.626 --> 01:37:31.947]  No, the health care bill raises taxes.
[01:37:31.967 --> 01:37:35.129]  Uh, there are all these new tax increases involved.
[01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:36.710]  The government's spending too much.
[01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:39.811]  Obama spent more than all presidents before him combined.
[01:37:40.311 --> 01:37:45.253]  None of this is debatable, and these Democrats run around lying, saying that that's not happening.
[01:37:45.333 --> 01:37:49.054]  And if your boss gets a tax increase, they just pass it on to you.
[01:37:49.395 --> 01:37:51.355]  You don't get bonuses, and you get your pay cut.
[01:37:51.796 --> 01:37:57.558]  And now Obama wants a value-added tax that will hit everybody in America.
[01:37:58.498 --> 01:38:01.099]  And they want carbon taxes that'll hit everybody in America.
[01:38:01.679 --> 01:38:03.480]  But I watch these Democrats at these events.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:05.761]  In fact, I sent you a video this morning of one just chanting,
[01:38:06.201 --> 01:38:06.541]  It does.
[01:38:06.601 --> 01:38:07.722]  There is no tax.
[01:38:08.042 --> 01:38:09.183]  Our taxes are too low.
[01:38:09.203 --> 01:38:10.464]  They're ridiculously low.
[01:38:10.484 --> 01:38:12.165]  I mean, they're just mindless.
[01:38:12.186 --> 01:38:12.586]  Go ahead.
[01:38:12.866 --> 01:38:13.947]  Okay, so the 9-11 truth.
[01:38:14.087 --> 01:38:16.228]  I started asking people how many buildings went down.
[01:38:16.249 --> 01:38:18.850]  I got 7, 5, 10.
[01:38:19.331 --> 01:38:20.932]  No one knew how many buildings went down.
[01:38:20.972 --> 01:38:22.533]  I started talking to people, dialoguing.
[01:38:22.853 --> 01:38:23.954]  They all shouted me down.
[01:38:23.974 --> 01:38:24.895]  They told me to get away.
[01:38:25.235 --> 01:38:27.677]  We don't want conspiracy theorists here.
[01:38:27.697 --> 01:38:28.558]  Go away.
[01:38:28.618 --> 01:38:30.159]  I said, free speech, free speech.
[01:38:30.819 --> 01:38:34.142]  Most of them were neocon Republicans at this Napa tax party.
[01:38:34.682 --> 01:38:35.663]  So it was unfortunate.
[01:38:35.863 --> 01:38:39.444]  I did have signs that said, Bush, Obama, Wall Street, puppets.
[01:38:40.105 --> 01:38:41.865]  I had a sign, indict the banksters.
[01:38:42.726 --> 01:38:44.547]  Jail, not bail out.
[01:38:45.027 --> 01:38:47.268]  Now those people did applaud those signs.
[01:38:47.728 --> 01:38:49.849]  But all in all I thought it was kind of a neocon thing.
[01:38:49.869 --> 01:39:02.115]  Well look, the same military industrial complex that will give you Mitt Romney and Petraeus, or Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, or Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin, or Governor Perry, Rick Perry and Palin,
[01:39:02.575 --> 01:39:16.084]  They're going to give you exactly what you've been getting, and again, that's why we may lose this country, because you've got idiot Obama supporters, and you've got idiot mainline Republicans who just won't grow up and admit the world government is here.
[01:39:16.104 --> 01:39:19.867]  They all thought that Sarah Palin had started the Tea Party movement.
[01:39:20.247 --> 01:39:21.608]  Well, because the media keeps lying.
[01:39:21.648 --> 01:39:24.750]  It was Ron Paul's supporters, and that's on record.
[01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:27.071]  No one believes me, but anyways, I did my part.
[01:39:27.111 --> 01:39:27.592]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:39:28.513 --> 01:39:30.195]  God bless you, I appreciate your call, Debbie.
[01:39:30.535 --> 01:39:47.495]  Yeah, they won't admit either that, in fact, cue up from yesterday, I wanted to play yesterday but I didn't, the Al Sharpton, Pat Robertson clip, but first I want to play Newt Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi saying global warming's real, we gotta do something.
[01:39:48.095 --> 01:39:56.198]  And a Newt Gingrich is finally being questioned by people at tea parties, and the rest of the tea party people are dragging them out.
[01:39:56.498 --> 01:39:56.818]  No!
[01:39:57.098 --> 01:39:57.318]  No!
[01:39:57.418 --> 01:39:58.259]  You don't bring that up!
[01:39:58.299 --> 01:39:59.059]  Newt's not for it!
[01:39:59.099 --> 01:40:00.539]  Newt's actually, well, yes I am.
[01:40:00.559 --> 01:40:02.500]  And the Republicans are like, well, then we better do it.
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:03.220]  I mean, you know.
[01:40:04.021 --> 01:40:05.181]  And Bill O'Reilly's for it.
[01:40:05.221 --> 01:40:07.402]  And Sarah Palin believes in global warming.
[01:40:07.442 --> 01:40:09.262]  I mean, I'm not going to put up with this anymore.
[01:40:09.983 --> 01:40:10.623]  I'm done!
[01:40:11.423 --> 01:40:12.824]  Newt Gingrich is a globalist.
[01:40:12.924 --> 01:40:14.424]  Newt Gingrich is a piece of trash.
[01:40:15.725 --> 01:40:16.645]  Here is Newt Gingrich.
[01:40:17.626 --> 01:40:21.989]  Hi, I'm Nancy Pelosi, lifelong Democrat and Speaker of the House.
[01:40:22.289 --> 01:40:25.852]  And I'm Newt Gingrich, lifelong Republican and I used to be Speaker.
[01:40:26.272 --> 01:40:28.894]  We don't always see eye to eye, do we Newt?
[01:40:29.434 --> 01:40:33.977]  No, but we do agree our country must take action to address climate change.
[01:40:34.217 --> 01:40:36.999]  We need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast.
[01:40:37.279 --> 01:40:41.362]  If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need.
[01:40:41.782 --> 01:40:43.684]  Go to WeCanSolveIt.org.
[01:40:44.044 --> 01:40:45.505]  Together, we can do this.
[01:40:47.293 --> 01:40:48.974]  And I'm supposed to put up with this from Newt.
[01:40:49.014 --> 01:40:50.876]  I mean, I know what Newt Gingrich has done.
[01:40:50.896 --> 01:40:52.236]  I know his voting record.
[01:40:52.957 --> 01:40:54.018]  I know who he is.
[01:40:55.639 --> 01:41:01.943]  He's for torture, warrantless spying, secret police, illegal wars, global carbon taxes.
[01:41:01.963 --> 01:41:06.406]  I mean, this guy is part of the New World Order big time.
[01:41:06.446 --> 01:41:09.268]  He's written books about world government and how great it is.
[01:41:09.308 --> 01:41:10.149]  I mean, he's a sicko.
[01:41:11.773 --> 01:41:14.454]  And it's the same thing with Pat Robertson.
[01:41:14.914 --> 01:41:16.075]  It's the same thing with Al Sharpton.
[01:41:16.095 --> 01:41:18.756]  They're all a bunch of sellouts to the New World Order and they control the left and right.
[01:41:18.776 --> 01:41:21.277]  It's like Mary Madeline married to Carvel.
[01:41:21.817 --> 01:41:29.861]  Or it's like all these husband and wife teams and the two brothers that are political hacks on the left and right.
[01:41:31.922 --> 01:41:37.264]  There are just so many examples of this and it's a joke to these people.
[01:41:38.103 --> 01:41:39.163]  Let's play the next clip.
[01:41:39.623 --> 01:41:41.924]  Now let's face it, we're polar opposites.
[01:41:42.204 --> 01:41:43.684]  We couldn't be further apart.
[01:41:43.704 --> 01:41:44.624]  I'm on the left.
[01:41:44.824 --> 01:41:45.884]  And I'm usually right.
[01:41:46.405 --> 01:41:47.925]  And we strongly disagree.
[01:41:48.205 --> 01:41:49.425]  Except on one issue.
[01:41:49.785 --> 01:41:51.045]  Tell them what it is, Reverend Pat.
[01:41:51.426 --> 01:41:52.606]  That would be our planet.
[01:41:52.966 --> 01:41:55.626]  Taking care of it is extremely important.
[01:41:55.746 --> 01:41:58.827]  We all need to work together, liberals and conservatives.
[01:41:59.387 --> 01:42:00.567]  So get involved.
[01:42:00.827 --> 01:42:02.808]  It's the right thing to do.
[01:42:02.828 --> 01:42:03.848]  Now there you go again.
[01:42:04.708 --> 01:42:05.108]  Join us.
[01:42:05.389 --> 01:42:07.450]  Together we can solve the climate crisis.
[01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:09.031]  Go to WeCanSolveIt.org.
[01:42:10.072 --> 01:42:25.842]  I mean, you've got the NFL, you've had the Republican leadership, you've had the Democratic leadership, you've had the Fortune 500 all lined up, the car makers, everybody, Exxon Mobil, the big oil companies founded the carbon tax, and they've got a new bill.
[01:42:27.143 --> 01:42:30.464]  Introduce, this is out of alternate today, U.S.
[01:42:31.304 --> 01:42:33.905]  Senate climate bill to be unveiled April 26.
[01:42:33.945 --> 01:42:40.467]  They're back with another one with a gas tax, a federal gas tax.
[01:42:40.907 --> 01:42:44.728]  And they've got value-added taxes and taxes on all the factories and businesses.
[01:42:46.775 --> 01:42:49.556]  And have you read the last bill that passed the House and is in the Senate?
[01:42:49.616 --> 01:42:50.516]  Home inspections.
[01:42:50.576 --> 01:42:52.857]  I mean, you can't even imagine.
[01:42:53.357 --> 01:43:00.700]  This is global corporations with selective enforcement to shut down their competition and put taxes on everything you do.
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:05.261]  And they're back, and they're saying the Republicans and Lindsey Graham are gonna pass it.
[01:43:05.681 --> 01:43:07.222]  Remember Bush was for amnesty?
[01:43:08.022 --> 01:43:09.963]  And I get emails saying he was not for amnesty.
[01:43:09.983 --> 01:43:12.023]  I get emails saying he wasn't for the assault weapons ban.
[01:43:12.043 --> 01:43:12.804]  Yes, he was!
[01:43:13.244 --> 01:43:13.704]  Stop it!
[01:43:14.895 --> 01:43:16.956]  But see, Democrats don't like Republicans.
[01:43:16.996 --> 01:43:21.917]  So if Republicans attack Democrats, Democrats will support what the Democrats are doing no matter how bad it is.
[01:43:22.437 --> 01:43:26.558]  And if Democrats attack Republicans, then Republicans will support them.
[01:43:26.618 --> 01:43:31.139]  It's all moronic-level mind control.
[01:43:33.059 --> 01:43:35.560]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:38.001]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Connecticut.
[01:43:38.021 --> 01:43:38.801]  George, you're on the air.
[01:43:40.538 --> 01:43:43.140]  Alex, I want to just keep one thing in mind.
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:44.541]  I have something I was going to add to this.
[01:43:44.561 --> 01:43:46.162]  This just came up as you were talking.
[01:43:46.202 --> 01:43:49.785]  They have to win on every front to really make this work.
[01:43:49.825 --> 01:43:52.247]  And that means not just in our country, in the world.
[01:43:52.507 --> 01:43:54.288]  And that's why they're going after the internet.
[01:43:54.328 --> 01:43:56.350]  That's why they're going after fossil fuel.
[01:43:56.370 --> 01:43:58.051]  That's why they're trying to go after farming.
[01:43:58.271 --> 01:44:00.573]  They're shutting everything off to make us dependent.
[01:44:00.613 --> 01:44:00.933]  Go ahead.
[01:44:01.814 --> 01:44:03.515]  The Chinese are not going to go along with it.
[01:44:03.535 --> 01:44:04.636]  They'll play along.
[01:44:04.836 --> 01:44:07.938]  Look, I lived in Asia long enough and I lived in Japan long enough.
[01:44:08.311 --> 01:44:17.444]  They're playing us for suckers because they'll play along for this game and if they play this game and think they're going to win, they're going to lose because they're going to let their own trap fall in on them.
[01:44:17.464 --> 01:44:18.705]  They're going to pick up the pieces.
[01:44:19.206 --> 01:44:22.771]  I mean, this is a loser's game for these idiots.
[01:44:23.192 --> 01:44:24.794]  But the real issue is I'm thinking of
[01:44:25.231 --> 01:44:39.795]  Why don't we make up pamphleteers like they won the revolution and stick it in, call them truth pamphlets with bulletins, whether it's from you or from other sources that tell the people the truth, and stick them in the free newspapers and the regular newspapers.
[01:44:40.175 --> 01:44:41.996]  And say the real Tea Party.
[01:44:42.296 --> 01:44:46.917]  That's why Obama created the Coffee Party, because we had the idea to do it, to try to confuse everybody.
[01:44:48.078 --> 01:44:48.979]  It's just amazing.
[01:44:48.999 --> 01:44:50.681]  Yes, all of us have to get aggressive.
[01:44:50.921 --> 01:44:53.264]  There's more of us than there are Republicans and Democrats.
[01:44:53.765 --> 01:44:55.868]  Most people call themselves libertarians or independents.
[01:44:56.208 --> 01:44:59.933]  We have to just never shut up and engage on every front.
[01:45:01.266 --> 01:45:27.394]  And I think, I think, I don't know how much you're getting overseas in other languages, but if there are people out there that really are into this, and can speak other languages, can write in other languages, get this out to other parties, and then... Absolutely, my films and clips of the TV show and radio show are being translated into Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, German, Russian, Polish, Japanese, there's all sorts of translations out there.
[01:45:28.534 --> 01:45:30.275]  And we need more, we need more people to do that.
[01:45:31.417 --> 01:45:31.597]  Great.
[01:45:31.617 --> 01:45:35.359]  And the New York Times had an article I think you maybe wanted to look at quickly.
[01:45:35.419 --> 01:45:37.079]  It's just in today's Times on 8-16.
[01:45:37.939 --> 01:45:46.923]  That bastard Clinton basically is trying to tear down all the internet and saying that it's encouraging violence against the government and things like that.
[01:45:47.203 --> 01:45:48.163]  Oh yeah, no, no, no.
[01:45:48.203 --> 01:45:49.104]  They're in.
[01:45:49.664 --> 01:45:56.506]  Every day I see masses of articles where they're saying they're going to shut the web down as we know it and have a controlled internet with a few thousand channels.
[01:45:56.566 --> 01:45:57.647]  It's all being announced.
[01:45:59.096 --> 01:46:08.639]  We're all in the echo chamber trying to, basically he's trying to say we're in some sort of padded cell and that we're creating our own violent tendencies.
[01:46:08.679 --> 01:46:09.580]  They don't seem to get it.
[01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:17.743]  They know people are upset about losing their standard of living and their basic freedoms and so they're going, you people are crazy.
[01:46:18.143 --> 01:46:19.303]  You don't love your government.
[01:46:19.343 --> 01:46:21.424]  We're going to shut down your ways to communicate.
[01:46:21.984 --> 01:46:22.865]  You understand us?
[01:46:23.446 --> 01:46:25.649]  But we have to understand how late it is.
[01:46:25.989 --> 01:46:27.170]  We're kicking their butt.
[01:46:27.210 --> 01:46:28.492]  We're starting to turn the tide.
[01:46:28.812 --> 01:46:30.794]  And so they're going to turn over the chessboard here.
[01:46:31.095 --> 01:46:33.878]  So we better use the internet while we still can.
[01:46:34.238 --> 01:46:35.159]  Push for the freedom.
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.042]  Push for it to stay open.
[01:46:37.402 --> 01:46:39.164]  But also develop other systems.
[01:46:39.204 --> 01:46:42.208]  That's why the DVDs and the films are so important on hard copy.

[01:46:51.334 --> 01:46:52.255]  God bless you, my friend.

[01:51:10.518 --> 01:51:17.099]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, his phone calls to us are getting blocked somehow, but he's able to get through on a calling card.
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:21.440]  And this is a very important case of Richard Fine.
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:22.160]  Here's the headline.
[01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:22.500]  The U.S.
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:29.522]  Supreme Court will consider the case of a 70-year-old taxpayer advocate, Richard Fine, who has languished in jail for more than a year.
[01:51:29.902 --> 01:51:31.422]  This is an amazing story.
[01:51:31.482 --> 01:51:34.703]  He's a former federal antitrust lawyer, Ph.D.
[01:51:36.304 --> 01:51:38.625]  And it is admitted that judges in L.A.
[01:51:38.665 --> 01:51:43.609]  County are being paid money under the table, similar to the case MSNBC reports on.
[01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:46.050]  Two judges plead guilty in sending kids to lockup.
[01:51:46.431 --> 01:51:51.855]  Pair admit they got $2.6 million in payoffs to put away young people in a private facility.
[01:51:52.095 --> 01:51:55.517]  So this is going on everywhere, but no jury, no charges.
[01:51:55.917 --> 01:52:00.501]  Over a year in jail because he's been exposing the very judge that put him in jail.
[01:52:01.001 --> 01:52:05.562]  Now, this is the essence of tyranny, what we see in the Declaration of Independence, what we were fighting against.
[01:52:05.942 --> 01:52:07.463]  Richard Fine, you've got the floor.
[01:52:07.543 --> 01:52:08.683]  Tell people what's happened to you.
[01:52:09.964 --> 01:52:17.706]  Okay, well, what has happened to me, very simply, is that I exposed the scheme under which L.A.
[01:52:17.746 --> 01:52:22.107]  County supervisors have paid over $300 million.
[01:52:22.167 --> 01:52:24.768]  Your call may be monitored or recorded.
[01:52:25.399 --> 01:52:28.521]  In the last 23 years to the L.A.
[01:52:28.721 --> 01:52:30.903]  County Superior Court Judges.
[01:52:31.683 --> 01:52:39.028]  Now the interesting thing about this is that the Superior Court Judges are state elected judges.
[01:52:39.908 --> 01:52:43.130]  They have absolutely no relationship to L.A.
[01:52:43.190 --> 01:52:43.551]  County.
[01:52:44.671 --> 01:52:50.295]  These judges are elected in state elections, they're state officials, and they're state employees.
[01:52:51.451 --> 01:52:57.956]  And what happened approximately 23 years ago in the late 1980s, the L.A.
[01:52:58.036 --> 01:53:11.167]  County Supervisors decided that they were going to pay sitting judges money to attract and retain qualified judges to sit in L.A.
[01:53:11.207 --> 01:53:11.507]  County.
[01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:21.714]  Now, this is totally ridiculous because of the fact that you can't attract a sitting judge to become a judge.
[01:53:22.034 --> 01:53:26.276]  And you can't retain a sitting judge to become a judge because the judges are elected.
[01:53:27.125 --> 01:53:30.327]  So you can't give them money to attract them to have a job that they already have.
[01:53:30.347 --> 01:53:32.888]  You can't give them money to retain a job for which they're elected.
[01:53:32.908 --> 01:53:33.269]  That's right.
[01:53:33.289 --> 01:53:35.190]  Now, interestingly enough, Alex, it wasn't down in the open.
[01:53:35.210 --> 01:53:36.351]  The way that they did it,
[01:53:56.352 --> 01:53:58.174]  They did it through the budget process.
[01:53:58.815 --> 01:54:02.920]  And in the budget there was an item called trial court funding.
[01:54:03.941 --> 01:54:06.944]  And they just plugged it into trial court funding.
[01:54:07.344 --> 01:54:12.971]  And there really was no way that the public really saw that this was money going to the judges.
[01:54:14.218 --> 01:54:21.721]  The only way you could find it is if you could find maybe a footnote that would say it was part of trial court funding, that the money would be paid in cash.
[01:54:33.044 --> 01:54:36.185]  The judges were getting, in 2007 and 2008, they were getting $46,366 per judge per year.
[01:54:36.246 --> 01:54:37.346]  And there are 430 judges in L.A.
[01:54:37.386 --> 01:54:37.566]  County.
[01:54:37.586 --> 01:54:38.306]  On top of their state paycheck.
[01:54:51.718 --> 01:54:54.020]  Yeah, the state paycheck was $178,000 a year, plus $30,000 in benefits.
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:56.282]  So the judges were basically taking home about $250,000 a year.
[01:54:56.342 --> 01:55:00.886]  That is more than the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, who only takes home $218,000 a year.
[01:55:11.796 --> 01:55:17.238]  Now this is across the board, by the way, throughout California.
[01:55:17.258 --> 01:55:24.781]  55 out of the 58 counties in California is paying extra money so that you at home may be monitored or recorded.
[01:55:25.221 --> 01:55:27.622]  Not all of them are paying as much money as L.A.
[01:55:27.682 --> 01:55:28.482]  County, however.
[01:55:28.542 --> 01:55:30.643]  Some of them are only paying a few thousand dollars.
[01:55:31.623 --> 01:55:35.565]  In fact, in our latest report that came out this year,
[01:55:36.315 --> 01:55:42.059]  I think it's $33 million is being paid to judges throughout California.
[01:55:42.859 --> 01:55:44.520]  $23 million of it is being paid in L.A.
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:44.921]  County.
[01:55:46.041 --> 01:55:46.722]  Unbelievable.
[01:55:46.802 --> 01:55:57.168]  And so you start exposing this, you start challenging cases where there's a major conflict of interest, and they throw you in jail and they're not charging you and you've been there for a year?
[01:55:57.208 --> 01:55:59.350]  I mean, are they saying you'll be there forever?
[01:56:00.975 --> 01:56:15.022]  Well, they wanted to keep me here until I tell them what my assets are so that they can grab my assets based upon a ruling that this Judge Yaffe made that I should pay money to L.A.
[01:56:15.082 --> 01:56:15.482]  County.
[01:56:16.103 --> 01:56:22.706]  Because what happened in this particular case is, and this is also very interesting because this shows you how deep the corruption is,
[01:56:23.524 --> 01:56:30.710]  What happened in this case, and the case is called Marina Strand Colony 2... We got a break.
[01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:32.492]  We got a break for the network and satellites.
[01:56:32.512 --> 01:56:33.473]  We're back in three minutes.
[01:56:33.513 --> 01:56:33.913]  Stay there.
[01:56:33.993 --> 01:56:35.274]  We hope they don't cut you off.
[01:56:36.736 --> 01:56:46.724]  And I've seen cases on CNN where the judges come out in Texas and admit they're getting the money from people's cars they take and wallets they take with no drugs or anything.
[01:56:46.764 --> 01:56:47.845]  It's just lawlessness.
[01:56:48.346 --> 01:56:49.327]  It's going on everywhere.
[01:56:50.529 --> 01:56:53.511]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:56:53.531 --> 01:56:57.194]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:00.257 --> 01:57:05.661]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:57:06.902 --> 01:57:11.665]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:57:12.046 --> 01:57:18.491]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:57:20.768 --> 01:57:27.195]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:57:29.250 --> 01:57:33.152]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.

[02:00:03.928 --> 02:00:24.131]  Richard Fine is our guest, a very distinguished criminal investigator, formerly with the Justice Department, Antitrust, had a lot of other great people that are working with him, Emmy Award winning researcher, Leslie Dutton, filmmaker,
[02:00:26.504 --> 02:00:37.112]  The details are online at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and some of the other great sites that are out there, FullDisclosure.net as well, FullDisclosure.net.
[02:00:37.693 --> 02:00:48.160]  But the Supreme Court, out of 10,000 cases a year, has decided to start hearing this case at the preliminary level next Friday.
[02:00:48.841 --> 02:00:50.902]  And so there's no courts in between really here.
[02:00:50.922 --> 02:00:53.204]  It's just going right to the Supreme Court, which is amazing.
[02:00:54.704 --> 02:00:55.024]  Go ahead.
[02:00:55.064 --> 02:00:59.585]  What happened, Alex, is that we went through, we went through all the courts.
[02:01:00.185 --> 02:01:05.527]  We went through the, um, from the California Superior Court.
[02:01:06.227 --> 02:01:11.168]  We went through the California Court of Appeals, the California Supreme Court.
[02:01:12.808 --> 02:01:13.409]  I didn't know that.
[02:01:13.449 --> 02:01:18.710]  I guess there's several cases, several cases involved in, but I mean, to be clear, give us the name of the case.
[02:01:21.661 --> 02:01:33.048]  The name of the case that the Supreme Court is going to be hearing is Richard I. Fine vs. the Sheriff of Los Angeles County.
[02:01:34.009 --> 02:01:36.891]  And that's the case that I'm being held on.
[02:01:37.451 --> 02:01:46.777]  The underlying case is the case of Arena Strand County 2 Homeowners Association vs. the County of Los Angeles.
[02:01:47.606 --> 02:01:50.968]  And that's the case that we started talking about right before the break.
[02:01:51.729 --> 02:01:55.731]  You know, the interesting thing about that case is that shows even more corruption.
[02:01:56.452 --> 02:02:07.959]  Because what happened in that case is you had a developer, and the developer's company name was Delray Shores Joint Venture and Delray Shores Joint Venture North.
[02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:13.583]  But it was owned by, but the managing partner is a guy by the name of Gary B. Epstein.
[02:02:14.515 --> 02:02:24.762]  Epstein and his chief of staff, Robert David O. Levine, they gave money to campaign contributions.
[02:02:24.842 --> 02:02:26.363]  Sound familiar?
[02:02:26.443 --> 02:02:33.788]  To the two supervisors, Michael Antonovich and Don Cannabi.
[02:02:34.589 --> 02:02:38.932]  And they gave this money to Cannabi and Antonovich in April of 2007.
[02:02:39.152 --> 02:02:43.415]  Now remember that date, because here's how the story comes down the line.
[02:02:44.491 --> 02:02:50.073]  These people wanted to redevelop the apartment complex in Marina Del Rey, California.
[02:02:50.393 --> 02:02:55.135]  And they wanted to expand it to 250-some units, 500-some units.
[02:02:55.195 --> 02:03:00.097]  In order to do that, they needed an environmental impact report.
[02:03:01.138 --> 02:03:05.499]  And as part of the environmental impact report, they show how it's going to affect the environment.
[02:03:05.579 --> 02:03:11.522]  And one of the other things, you have to show that it'll have a positive financial impact on L.A.
[02:03:11.542 --> 02:03:11.862]  County.
[02:03:12.594 --> 02:03:21.777]  The interesting thing here is that Marina Del Rey is the largest small craft yacht harbor in the United States.
[02:03:22.117 --> 02:03:26.819]  It started out with 6,000 boats, now down to about 4,000.
[02:03:28.219 --> 02:03:41.464]  The county owns the land, and what the county does is the county leases out the land to these developers who put apartment complexes on the land, and then they end up paying the county for the use of the land.
[02:03:42.208 --> 02:03:44.909]  I'm going to digress slightly here to show you how bad this is.
[02:03:45.590 --> 02:03:55.355]  These developers are making, they're taking in about $350 million a year in rent from these apartments.
[02:03:55.935 --> 02:04:00.457]  They pay the county approximately $35 billion a year for the land.
[02:04:01.438 --> 02:04:03.979]  They should be paying the county approximately $100 billion a year for the land.
[02:04:06.713 --> 02:04:08.575]  So the people, the taxpayers in L.A.
[02:04:08.615 --> 02:04:14.379]  County are losing $70 million a year in land rent from the developers.
[02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:21.325]  In the last 10 years, the taxpayers of Los Angeles County have lost approximately a billion dollars in rent.
[02:04:22.526 --> 02:04:24.868]  Your phone may be monitored or recorded.
[02:04:24.888 --> 02:04:26.169]  That's just how this has come about.
[02:04:26.649 --> 02:04:31.313]  It comes about because of the fact that the developers give campaign contributions
[02:04:31.897 --> 02:04:32.839]  We're good to go.
[02:04:43.965 --> 02:04:47.969]  Well let's be clear, let's be clear, because I notice that all the time in Austin where I live.
[02:04:48.510 --> 02:05:03.525]  I've got to pay all these property taxes, business taxes, but big corporations come in, they make political contributions and the city says, we waive your property tax for 10 years, we waive your environmental fees, we waive everything, because they've made political contributions.
[02:05:03.565 --> 02:05:07.709]  But separately to me here, the big case, regardless, is that I've
[02:05:08.389 --> 02:05:18.218]  I'm no lawyer, but I know the Supreme Court has held over and over again that the police can't hold you for more than five days without basically charging you.
[02:05:18.238 --> 02:05:21.040]  So they're violating habeas corpus here, are they not?
[02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:24.723]  That's right, and that's the case that's up before the Supreme Court.
[02:05:25.104 --> 02:05:28.767]  But let me get through the back bar to show you how we get to that case.
[02:05:29.568 --> 02:05:30.269]  He must recuse!
[02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:59.170]  That's for Jews, exactly.
[02:05:59.610 --> 02:06:05.031]  Well, Konabi and Antonovich both advocated and voted on the project.
[02:06:05.731 --> 02:06:06.792]  Now, there were four votes.
[02:06:07.332 --> 02:06:12.813]  So, two of them were illegal, which meant that the EIR, the vote on the EIR was illegal.
[02:06:13.713 --> 02:06:18.254]  I came in and I sued to stop that EIR in the court.
[02:06:19.154 --> 02:06:20.934]  And we came in in front of Judge Yaffe.
[02:06:21.474 --> 02:06:25.095]  Now, what happened is that Judge Yaffe is getting his $26,000 from the county.
[02:06:27.453 --> 02:06:29.994]  So you know what happens.
[02:06:30.674 --> 02:06:35.156]  It turns out that Judge Yaffe allows the thing to go through.
[02:06:35.636 --> 02:06:39.818]  Now, during the course of this case, we have another thing that happens.
[02:06:40.478 --> 02:06:43.179]  We have the state bar making me inactive.
[02:06:43.579 --> 02:06:54.043]  And the sad part of that is that the judges have gone to the state bar to try and get me disbarred and be inactive because I have brought the same type of case against the judges back in 2002.
[02:06:55.914 --> 02:07:02.556]  ...saying that these payments violated the California Constitution and the due process clause of the U.S.
[02:07:02.716 --> 02:07:03.676]  Constitution.
[02:07:03.716 --> 02:07:07.397]  So the judges went to the state bar... And did you win that previous case?
[02:07:07.517 --> 02:07:09.058]  Did you win that previous case?
[02:07:10.038 --> 02:07:14.239]  I was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds in the federal court.
[02:07:14.659 --> 02:07:15.279]  However, in 2008,
[02:07:17.808 --> 02:07:24.290]  The California Court of Appeals held that these payments were illegal and unaccountable.
[02:07:24.311 --> 02:07:31.853]  Start over, start over, because again, our friend is a political prisoner in jail, Richard Fine, right now, so they keep popping in with the call may be monitored.
[02:07:32.774 --> 02:07:34.274]  Now, now, now, now, go back.
[02:07:34.374 --> 02:07:42.457]  So you had the California Court of Appeals rule in favor of you, because you were citing, because you were citing another ruling.
[02:07:43.278 --> 02:07:43.878]  Please continue.
[02:07:45.785 --> 02:07:53.991]  The California Court of Appeals held in 2008 in a case called Sturgeon v. The County of Los Angeles that the payments by L.A.
[02:07:54.052 --> 02:08:00.056]  Power to the Judges violated Article VI, Section 19 of the California Constitution.
[02:08:00.537 --> 02:08:04.900]  And that was the exact thing that I claimed in my 2002 case.
[02:08:06.061 --> 02:08:12.446]  So what the State Bar was doing to me was violating what the California Court of Appeals was holding to be
[02:08:13.086 --> 02:08:14.047]  Let me stop you again.
[02:08:15.167 --> 02:08:18.989]  Cities are chartered under the state constitution through the counties.
[02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:21.971]  The power comes from the state and the elected legislature.
[02:08:22.331 --> 02:08:25.893]  This is ass-backwards, as they say, where L.A.
[02:08:25.953 --> 02:08:30.696]  County is trying to absorb and take the judges literally under its control.
[02:08:30.936 --> 02:08:33.017]  But Sacramento's not concerned about that.
[02:08:33.117 --> 02:08:41.002]  The Court of Appeals was and ruled for you because then didn't they quietly pass a law, if I read this right, giving immunity to these judges?
[02:08:42.222 --> 02:08:43.083]  You're absolutely right.
[02:08:43.103 --> 02:09:04.959]  What happened is that after the Sturgeon decision came down, what the state did is that the state legislature passed a law saying that they gave retroactive immunity to the supervisors and the judges from criminal prosecution, civil liability, and disciplinary action.
[02:09:07.628 --> 02:09:09.768]  Because they know that these people have done wrong.
[02:09:09.848 --> 02:09:12.589]  And the criminal part of it was misappropriation of funds.
[02:09:12.609 --> 02:09:14.409]  So what happened is that I left the case in 2007.
[02:09:14.489 --> 02:09:15.210]  In 2008, Judge Yaffe
[02:09:37.643 --> 02:09:42.188]  Ordered me to pay money to the county without any notice to me.
[02:09:42.228 --> 02:09:45.232]  I was gone from the state in October 2007.
[02:09:45.732 --> 02:09:52.981]  In January 2008, Judge Haffey orders me to pay money to the county because I filed a paper one day late.
[02:09:53.622 --> 02:09:56.825]  The county had filed their papers 60 days late.
[02:09:56.965 --> 02:09:58.187]  He did nothing to the county.
[02:09:59.279 --> 02:10:05.723]  And he ordered me to pay money to the county without any notice to me, without my being present at the hearing.
[02:10:06.283 --> 02:10:19.350]  And I came in and I said, Judge, you can't do that because number one, you're violating the Constitution, but number two, you know, you're getting payments from the county.
[02:10:19.970 --> 02:10:24.953]  And now Yaffe has not disclosed, at this point, your phone may be monitored or recorded.
[02:10:24.973 --> 02:10:28.535]  Yaffe has not disclosed that he was getting payments from the county.
[02:10:29.477 --> 02:10:33.119]  And the county had not disclosed that they knew that EIR was illegal.
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:36.421]  And nor had Epstein disclosed that he knew that it was illegal.
[02:10:37.162 --> 02:10:43.026]  I then got Yaffe to admit, on the record, at a court hearing that he was getting these payments.
[02:10:43.826 --> 02:10:47.388]  And then I disqualified Yaffe, and Yaffe refused to leave the case.
[02:10:48.529 --> 02:10:54.433]  And then Yaffe ordered me to make the payment to disclose my assets,
[02:10:55.367 --> 02:10:55.967]  We're good.
[02:11:09.207 --> 02:11:14.332]  I got him to testify that he was receiving the payments, that he was not disclosing the payments.
[02:11:14.492 --> 02:11:17.955]  I mean, he should instantly, hold on, he should instantly recuse himself.
[02:11:18.055 --> 02:11:23.701]  Federal, state, law, I mean, all of the precedent says he must recuse himself.
[02:11:24.021 --> 02:11:27.645]  He's a witness in the courtroom when he's the judge.
[02:11:27.685 --> 02:11:28.726]  I mean, this is insanity.
[02:11:29.847 --> 02:11:30.607]  It truly is.
[02:11:30.667 --> 02:11:31.869]  It's absolutely insanity.
[02:11:31.949 --> 02:11:34.211]  It violates every Supreme Court precedent.
[02:11:35.482 --> 02:11:39.986]  Well that's like the Secretary of State in Kentucky with the State Ethics Board ruling.
[02:11:40.066 --> 02:11:46.010]  He can run his own election against Rand Paul for Senate in Kentucky.
[02:11:46.070 --> 02:11:47.231]  Never before done.
[02:11:47.351 --> 02:11:49.713]  And so he runs his own election.
[02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:07.991]  I mean, it is total insanity.
[02:12:08.051 --> 02:12:14.134]  I mean, this judge is ending up taking a bribe, and then he's judging his own actions of taking the bribe.
[02:12:14.595 --> 02:12:15.175]  Every U.S.
[02:12:15.195 --> 02:12:17.076]  Supreme Court precedent is against that.
[02:12:18.016 --> 02:12:32.724]  So, anyway, the end result of it is that Yaffe holds me in contempt for not answering, saying that I have to... Holds me in contempt and throws me in jail under coercive confinement.
[02:12:36.427 --> 02:12:52.055]  So now, via a civil judgment, no jury, no nothing, you're in jail more than a year.
[02:12:52.095 --> 02:13:01.100]  This is a dangerous precedent if it's allowed to stand, and we know the Supreme Court earlier in the year, you've had some of the other justices refuse it, but now Ginsburg is accepting it.
[02:13:03.181 --> 02:13:04.262]  I'm sorry, you got blocked out.
[02:13:04.282 --> 02:13:06.104]  You said the Supreme Court earlier in the year.
[02:13:06.844 --> 02:13:08.826]  Well, I mean, I've read over the case.
[02:13:08.846 --> 02:13:09.506]  Tell me if I'm right.
[02:13:10.607 --> 02:13:13.730]  Wasn't it Justice Stevens, or which one is it?
[02:13:13.770 --> 02:13:24.859]  Justice Kennedy earlier in the year denied my application, and then I went to Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Ginsburg was the one who called and maybe monitored or recorded.
[02:13:25.499 --> 02:13:27.621]  All right, so there... Tell us what's going to...
[02:13:28.795 --> 02:13:29.195]  Sure, sure.
[02:13:29.235 --> 02:13:30.196]  So we're running out of time.
[02:13:30.236 --> 02:13:35.460]  So tell us, Mr. Fang, the show's almost over here and we appreciate you joining us from prison, from your political dungeon.
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:38.842]  So what's happened in jail?
[02:13:39.402 --> 02:13:48.148]  I mean, if the Supreme Court says no, I guess you'll live out the rest of the 10, 15, 20 years there and the taxpayers will pay for it and a new president's set.
[02:13:48.208 --> 02:13:49.829]  Judges can say, put Alex in jail.
[02:13:49.849 --> 02:13:51.450]  Just put Bob in jail.
[02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:53.171]  Put Carol in jail.
[02:13:53.452 --> 02:13:55.593]  Just put the Pope in jail.
[02:13:55.633 --> 02:13:57.074]  Put anybody in jail.
[02:13:57.154 --> 02:13:57.874]  Dungeons.
[02:13:58.255 --> 02:13:58.635]  Goodbye.
[02:13:58.815 --> 02:14:01.837]  I mean, do we do whatever we want?
[02:14:01.877 --> 02:14:02.778]  That could be the case.
[02:14:02.998 --> 02:14:09.842]  It's really up to the Supreme Court to follow their precedence and basically set me free.
[02:14:09.862 --> 02:14:10.943]  That's where we're sitting at.
[02:14:11.323 --> 02:14:21.510]  One of the things I do want to mention before we close out is that there's going to be a rally for me on Tuesday, the 20th of April at the L.A.
[02:14:21.550 --> 02:14:22.471]  County Courthouse.
[02:14:23.143 --> 02:14:26.991]  Which is at Wedding Lane, North 4th Street in Los Angeles.
[02:14:27.072 --> 02:14:31.802]  And it's going to start at 7.30 in the morning when the judges come in to park their cars.
[02:14:40.778 --> 02:14:51.567]  And there's also one coming up at the Supreme Court, and we went over that two hours ago when we had Leslie Dutton on, and people can find out all the details at fulldisclosure.net.
[02:14:51.867 --> 02:14:56.031]  But sir, in the video interview I've seen, I mean, go back over.
[02:14:56.091 --> 02:14:58.673]  This is why we went to war against the British.
[02:14:59.273 --> 02:15:07.857]  In 1775-76, it's in the Declaration of Independence as the list of abuses, the exact same stuff that's being done to you.
[02:15:07.917 --> 02:15:15.220]  Talk about how, I mean, as a lawyer, as a former federal investigator, what this is like for people that don't understand the law.
[02:15:21.723 --> 02:15:27.205]  Well, you talked about the parallels between this and the Declaration of Independence and how big a deal this is.
[02:15:29.304 --> 02:15:43.355]  The big deal is that it's the exact parallel, because when you go to the last part of the Declaration of Independence, and you read that last part, that talks about the fact that the king controlled all the judges in the court.
[02:15:44.857 --> 02:15:54.985]  And therefore there was absolutely no way that anyone in the colonies had any opportunity to get any fairness in the judicial system in England.
[02:15:55.808 --> 02:15:58.169]  And that was one of the reasons why we went to war.
[02:15:58.910 --> 02:16:00.771]  That is why we had a revolution.
[02:16:01.391 --> 02:16:05.053]  And this right now is our new revolution.
[02:16:05.273 --> 02:16:08.915]  Except for we don't have to use guns at this point in time.
[02:16:09.316 --> 02:16:11.297]  We are using the democratic process.
[02:16:12.097 --> 02:16:15.099]  And by using the democratic process, we are coming through
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:24.829]  And we are going to go in and, as I'm doing, I am using the court system because I have a basic belief... Your call may be monitored or recorded.
[02:16:25.329 --> 02:16:31.335]  I have a basic belief that the United States Supreme Court is going to approve all of the precedents.
[02:16:31.395 --> 02:16:38.642]  These precedents that a judge can't judge his own actions go all the way back to the 16th century and started out in common law.
[02:16:40.896 --> 02:16:49.529]  So what are you expecting to do with Baca, the sheriff, these judges, if the Supreme Court tells them to let you out of jail?
[02:16:49.650 --> 02:16:52.594]  Are they going to go in there and claim that you've committed suicide or something?
[02:16:53.055 --> 02:16:54.598]  You're not planning to commit suicide, are you?
[02:16:56.311 --> 02:17:01.756]  I've survived, actually, I've survived ten years of this abuse.
[02:17:01.776 --> 02:17:07.301]  These judges started this whole thing out way back in 1999, trying to economically break me.
[02:17:07.881 --> 02:17:16.209]  As a friend of mine said, if they had the ability to shoot me, they probably would have, but they don't, roughly, they don't think in those terms.
[02:17:16.409 --> 02:17:19.291]  They probably think in those terms and probably don't have the guts to execute it.
[02:17:19.752 --> 02:17:21.133]  Thank God for me.
[02:17:23.755 --> 02:17:27.639]  Well, my plan is a very simple thing, and I call it the three A's.
[02:17:27.999 --> 02:17:30.502]  It's awareness, attachment, and action.
[02:17:30.962 --> 02:17:33.364]  And that means it's due to people like yourself.
[02:17:33.825 --> 02:17:42.873]  People become aware of what is happening, and then they attach to what is happening by picking up with that awareness, and the third thing becomes action.
[02:17:42.973 --> 02:17:46.256]  And as I said in my video, you vote the bums out.
[02:17:47.017 --> 02:17:53.539]  Because what takes place is that we are the ones that actually have the ability to do things.
[02:17:53.579 --> 02:17:54.300]  Richard Fine!
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:55.160]  Richard Fine!
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:56.500]  We got a break.
[02:17:56.581 --> 02:17:58.041]  Final segment after this break.

[02:19:04.691 --> 02:19:05.632]  Tyranny is here.
[02:19:05.972 --> 02:19:09.593]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:19:09.613 --> 02:19:12.115]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:19:12.135 --> 02:19:17.557]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:19:17.997 --> 02:19:24.200]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:19:24.660 --> 02:19:30.202]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:19:30.602 --> 02:19:34.283]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening death to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:19:34.824 --> 02:19:38.785]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[02:19:45.047 --> 02:19:47.928]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:19:48.589 --> 02:19:50.031]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:19:50.572 --> 02:19:51.052]  It's here.

[02:19:59.784 --> 02:20:02.966]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:20:03.327 --> 02:20:05.168]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:20:05.629 --> 02:20:06.029]  Don't!
[02:20:06.489 --> 02:20:09.511]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:20:09.932 --> 02:20:10.552]  Why pay?
[02:20:10.732 --> 02:20:17.057]  When you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'

[02:20:33.607 --> 02:20:34.548]  Herb K was right.
[02:20:34.768 --> 02:20:37.849]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:39.030]  What have you got to lose?
[02:20:39.430 --> 02:20:40.411]  Stop the calls now.
[02:20:40.691 --> 02:20:42.412]  Get out of debt and have more money.

[02:20:56.146 --> 02:21:08.642]  800-822-1291 You can run on for a long time with your corruption, but finally the chickens come home to roost.
[02:21:13.116 --> 02:21:15.898]  All over the country, judges are being paid off under the table.
[02:21:17.339 --> 02:21:19.020]  I'll take you back to MSNBC.
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:22.002]  Two judges plead guilty to sending kids to lock up who were innocent.
[02:21:22.342 --> 02:21:27.605]  The pair paid $2.6 million in payoff to put away young offenders in a private prison.
[02:21:27.625 --> 02:21:30.287]  That's in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia.
[02:21:31.187 --> 02:21:41.638]  We're almost out of time here, Richard Fine, but this is a 1776 issue and all the precedents, as you said, clearly show this is out of control.
[02:21:41.658 --> 02:21:44.642]  Have you seen the judge lately?
[02:21:44.682 --> 02:21:45.643]  Are they still arrogant?
[02:21:45.703 --> 02:21:48.245]  Are your jailers proud of the system they're a part of?
[02:21:50.431 --> 02:21:52.412]  No, the judge refuses to see me.
[02:21:52.512 --> 02:22:07.840]  I filed a full abortion under what we call the FAR case, which demands that I be set free, because to hold me coercively, the case says that when the coercion isn't going to work, it becomes penal, and when it's penal, I have to be out within five days.
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:10.441]  So basically, I should have been out of here by March 9, 2009.
[02:22:10.861 --> 02:22:12.762]  This judge is basically in hiding.
[02:22:13.182 --> 02:22:15.984]  He's in caps and stuff in the courthouse, and it's not allowed.
[02:22:19.577 --> 02:22:24.863]  As far as my jailers are concerned, the guards here are- Your call may be monitored or recorded.
[02:22:24.883 --> 02:22:27.506]  The guards here are basically on my side.
[02:22:27.906 --> 02:22:28.146]  Good.
[02:22:28.166 --> 02:22:30.089]  The internal people that they care of me.
[02:22:30.389 --> 02:22:35.635]  Because these guys are trying to do a job, and they are hit just as bad as every other citizen.
[02:22:35.975 --> 02:22:36.215]  Good.
[02:22:36.235 --> 02:22:37.377]  On their own personal rights.
[02:22:37.597 --> 02:22:39.219]  So, uh, they're with us.
[02:22:39.875 --> 02:22:40.135]  I think so.
[02:23:03.982 --> 02:23:09.888]  Well, sir, I would imagine the power structure is starting to get scared.
[02:23:10.149 --> 02:23:12.651]  This is now going to the Supreme Court last week.
[02:23:12.731 --> 02:23:14.133]  We appreciate your perseverance.
[02:23:14.153 --> 02:23:16.315]  We're all going to be praying for you, Mr. Fine.
[02:23:16.776 --> 02:23:20.179]  We'll track this next week and the week after that, and we're in your corner.
[02:23:20.479 --> 02:23:21.140]  God bless you.
[02:23:21.160 --> 02:23:22.121]  Go with God, my friend.
[02:23:22.141 --> 02:23:24.784]  Okay, thank you very much, Alex.
[02:23:24.824 --> 02:23:25.725]  You guys take care.
[02:23:26.124 --> 02:23:26.724]  You too, sir.
[02:23:27.264 --> 02:23:27.945]  All right, there you go.
[02:23:28.025 --> 02:23:34.467]  Richard Fein, another political prisoner here in America with a K. What an amazing week of broadcast.
[02:23:34.607 --> 02:23:35.668]  So much happening.
[02:23:35.728 --> 02:23:36.708]  So much coming out.
[02:23:36.748 --> 02:23:37.869]  The people awakening.
[02:23:38.269 --> 02:23:43.111]  The establishment being exposed, sending provocateurs to tea parties in Nazi outfits.
[02:23:44.031 --> 02:23:46.172]  And to discredit, it's not working.
[02:23:46.272 --> 02:23:47.433]  People are waking up.
[02:23:47.473 --> 02:23:48.313]  They're finding out
[02:23:48.593 --> 02:23:49.994]  The truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:06.686 --> 02:24:09.189]  It's not just the fake environmentalists that are stopping this.
[02:24:09.910 --> 02:24:11.792]  So that's important information.
[02:24:12.292 --> 02:24:16.797]  Oil companies conspiring to jack up gasoline prices by creating artificial scarcity.
[02:24:17.258 --> 02:24:19.440]  A key article up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:24:20.862 --> 02:24:23.823]  We have the viral video on the front page of YouTube.
[02:24:24.063 --> 02:24:25.663]  We want to make this the number one video.
[02:24:25.683 --> 02:24:34.344]  It exposes how torture is wrong and how people are more and more only caring about possessions and how they don't form relationships with humans but do it with computers.
[02:24:34.405 --> 02:24:37.785]  It's called iPad Torture to Death in Mass Social Experiment.
[02:24:37.805 --> 02:24:41.886]  You can go take part in the mass social experiment at InfoWars.com.
[02:24:42.546 --> 02:24:45.367]  Please pass that around to everyone.
[02:24:45.407 --> 02:24:47.147]  Another article that ties into this
[02:24:48.067 --> 02:24:52.571]  Kill puppies and children, but God forbid don't hurt the iPad.
[02:24:52.611 --> 02:24:57.396]  That's the latest story at PrisonPlanet.com dealing with this psychological experiment.
[02:24:57.436 --> 02:25:01.239]  It's all explained if you want to understand what we're talking about at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:25:01.279 --> 02:25:02.481]  We premiered yesterday.
[02:25:03.041 --> 02:25:08.465]  We're getting great reviews, amazing reviews on Invisible Empire, New Order Defined.
[02:25:08.485 --> 02:25:09.386]  It's now shipping.
