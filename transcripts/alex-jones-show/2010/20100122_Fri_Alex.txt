[00:00:04.278 --> 00:00:05.579]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:07.339]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:09.100]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.681]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:12.241]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:16.443]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.443 --> 00:00:20.485]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:31.037]  Well, a lot of you know him from Jesse Ventura's top-rated show on TruTV.
[00:00:31.037 --> 00:00:36.709]  I recommended him for the research episode, Secret Society's Global Death Plot.
[00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:42.184]  And I believe that's his maiden voyage on national television.
[00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:47.089]  And it's his first time joining us here on the radio for this hour, perhaps a little bit of the next hour.
[00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.554]  We're going to be playing key audio clips that he recorded at conferences he attended and put on.
[00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:58.920]  He was the head of many of these high-powered conferences with Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Maurice Strong.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.703]  And so joining us is George Washington Hunt.
[00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:02.638]  I think?
[00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:22.540]  I'm glad to be here, Alex.
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.760]  Every chance I get to spread the bad news, that's my job.
[00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:54.190]  Well, you know, people sometimes... I went to the Fourth World Wilderness Congress on September 11, 1987.
[00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:06.154]  I went there because my son had been killed in a wilderness area in the later part of the year, or about a few months before.
[00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:20.162]  I was very sad, and also my other son, that was still living, said he wanted to repair huts along the Arctic for travelers, and he wanted to get into a job.
[00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:34.046]  So I heard the Fourth World Wilderness was coming to town, and with all its reindeer and pretty little bright lights, and I said, you know, maybe I could go there and rub shoulders with the Smokies, with the forest rangers, and get my son a job.
[00:02:35.157 --> 00:02:41.338]  And so I went down to the Congress and I saw the pictures of the reindeer and so on.
[00:02:41.338 --> 00:02:46.999]  But then I noticed on the program that there was another aspect away from Denver.
[00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:55.921]  The first two days of this Wilderness Congress, it's supposed to be pro-conservation, the first two days were in Denver.
[00:02:55.921 --> 00:03:04.402]  And then they moved a quasi-secret meeting up to the YMCA of Estes Park, Colorado.
[00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:16.876]  So, with my resourceful mind, I said to myself, I'd like to get into that Congress, but I didn't have any money.
[00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:27.282]  And then, lo and behold, I got the information that one of the official hosts of the meeting was ill with the flu.
[00:03:27.282 --> 00:03:28.483]  I got his number.
[00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:29.403]  I called him.
[00:03:29.403 --> 00:03:31.725]  He says, yeah, take my place.
[00:03:31.725 --> 00:03:33.906]  I was interviewed by about four
[00:03:34.793 --> 00:03:37.114]  Yes, well they were involved here too, Alex.
[00:03:58.757 --> 00:03:59.897]  They all run together.
[00:03:59.897 --> 00:04:12.361]  The psychics, the cults, the witches, the devils, the near-rich that want to get into the crowd.
[00:04:12.361 --> 00:04:13.902]  It's a whole mishmash.
[00:04:13.902 --> 00:04:16.343]  And there's video of this that you shot.
[00:04:16.343 --> 00:04:22.545]  Over time, you became the leader of the conferences, and we're going to get into that, how these twists of fate got you in this position.
[00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:24.065]  So we're going to break in a moment.
[00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:26.726]  Let's come back with George Hunt.
[00:04:27.381 --> 00:04:47.553]  goes he wants a spot at this event this conservation event you end up getting one of the places of one of the host and then suddenly you're with Rothschilds Rockefellers how did this happen you're approved by psychics to be able to go by them I mean it just goes on and on and on and I've done separate research from George Hunt
[00:04:49.677 --> 00:04:52.784]  Confirming what he said about Maury Strong and others.
[00:04:52.784 --> 00:04:56.713]  They want a one world religion as Al Gore is now openly saying.
[00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.356]  We'll be right back with George Hunt.
[00:04:59.312 --> 00:05:03.874]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:04.774]  Number one.
[00:05:04.774 --> 00:05:08.196]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:08.196 --> 00:05:09.056]  Number two.
[00:05:09.056 --> 00:05:13.958]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:14.698]  It's true.
[00:05:14.698 --> 00:05:19.240]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.381]  Number 3.
[00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:23.964]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:23.964 --> 00:05:27.908]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:27.908 --> 00:05:28.689]  Number 4.
[00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.452]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:31.452 --> 00:05:35.135]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:35.356]  Number 5.
[00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:40.057]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.057 --> 00:05:45.118]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:45.118 --> 00:05:49.280]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.080]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.661]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:06.051]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:09.292]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.292 --> 00:06:14.074]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:17.876]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[00:06:18.596 --> 00:06:20.477]  And they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.477 --> 00:06:25.541]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.541 --> 00:06:35.668]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.788 --> 00:06:38.129]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:39.710]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.171]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:44.312]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.312 --> 00:06:49.454]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.454 --> 00:06:58.557]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:04.271]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:07:04.271 --> 00:07:06.292]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:11.856]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:07:11.856 --> 00:07:19.881]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:30.247]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[00:07:30.407 --> 00:07:30.967]  I think so.
[00:08:00.715 --> 00:08:05.804]  He's set to meet the man who pulls together all the threads, George Hunt.
[00:08:09.787 --> 00:08:14.508]  It's not truly really about saving the planet from carbon dioxide.
[00:08:14.508 --> 00:08:16.008]  It's about making money.
[00:08:16.008 --> 00:08:18.449]  At an international level.
[00:08:18.449 --> 00:08:21.590]  We're not even talking here about country, country, country.
[00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.611]  We're talking about a global type money making thing, correct?
[00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:26.611]  Yes.
[00:08:26.611 --> 00:08:30.632]  We're talking about a powerful, immense aristocracy.
[00:08:31.485 --> 00:08:40.054]  That is, that has the intention of using the fear of the environment, uh, deteriorating.
[00:08:40.054 --> 00:08:45.579]  They're gonna use it to take over the world.
[00:08:45.579 --> 00:08:50.044]  George Hunt was an official at the World Wilderness Congress when he met Maurice Strong in 1987.
[00:08:50.044 --> 00:08:55.169]  The Congress is an international forum for discussing the environment.
[00:08:56.525 --> 00:09:09.058]  But Maury Strong showed up to introduce a new player, financier Edmund Rothschild of the Rothschild Banking Dynasty, and a proposal to create something called a World Conservation Bank.
[00:09:11.054 --> 00:09:19.901]  One of the most important initiatives that is open here is that of the Conservation Banking Program.
[00:09:19.901 --> 00:09:31.731]  We have as our chairman, fortunately, the person who epitomizes that positive synthesis between environment, conservation, on the one hand, and economics on the other.
[00:09:31.731 --> 00:09:37.556]  And I'm just delighted to have this opportunity of introducing to you Edmund de Rothschild.
[00:09:40.189 --> 00:09:50.254]  Maury Strong was in charge of the conservation movement, but he was also Edmund de Rothschild's right-hand man.
[00:09:50.254 --> 00:09:57.217]  You have money and the environment in one person, Edmund de Rothschild.
[00:09:57.217 --> 00:09:59.939]  Now, Maury Strong, I found out during...
[00:10:03.943 --> 00:10:06.666]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live with the rest of the hour.
[00:10:06.666 --> 00:10:08.767]  A little bit of the next hour.
[00:10:08.767 --> 00:10:12.070]  George Hunt is our guest to go in-depth.
[00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.914]  So, he's just looking into conservation jobs for his son.
[00:10:17.857 --> 00:10:20.039]  Uh, one of the presenters is sick.
[00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:21.660]  He says, I'd like to go.
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.762]  Suddenly, he's being vetted by them by psychics.
[00:10:24.762 --> 00:10:31.466]  And from my separate research, this is on record, Maury Strong has a weird cult compound in Colorado.
[00:10:31.466 --> 00:10:33.227]  It ties into Bohemian Grove.
[00:10:33.227 --> 00:10:34.808]  The UN, of course, is into the occult.
[00:10:34.808 --> 00:10:35.629]  He brought that up.
[00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:37.070]  That's coming up later.
[00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.872]  Okay, going back to George Hunt, naval officer.
[00:10:40.592 --> 00:10:41.852]  Yes, I had luncheon with the Rothschilds.
[00:10:41.852 --> 00:10:44.193]  They were very nice people.
[00:11:08.468 --> 00:11:13.931]  Lady Ross Child stood up when I came to the table and she filled my glass.
[00:11:13.931 --> 00:11:20.135]  And suddenly I said, thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies, my cup runneth over.
[00:11:20.135 --> 00:11:25.198]  And I was with the president of the World Conservation Bank, and I said,
[00:11:26.932 --> 00:11:35.758]  Michael Sweetman, how is this bank going to survive if the asset base is Arctic lands?
[00:11:35.758 --> 00:11:38.360]  They don't produce any dividends and interest.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.642]  He says, oh, we are worried.
[00:11:40.642 --> 00:11:45.045]  We are working on that, he said in his precise English.
[00:11:45.045 --> 00:11:46.426]  I said, you're working on it?
[00:11:46.426 --> 00:11:52.211]  You're going to have a seminar in a half an hour where you're going to accept this bank?
[00:11:52.811 --> 00:11:54.573]  What's going on, Michael?
[00:11:54.573 --> 00:11:58.897]  He said, you'll have a chance to ask us at the seminar.
[00:11:58.897 --> 00:12:02.200]  I looked him in the eye and said, Michael, are you going to call on me?
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.681]  Look me in the eye, Michael.
[00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:04.903]  Yes, I promise.
[00:12:04.903 --> 00:12:08.566]  Well, when we went to the seminar, and of course, he didn't call on me.
[00:12:08.566 --> 00:12:11.709]  It was a contrived Congress, and they accepted the bank.
[00:12:12.947 --> 00:12:20.870]  And we haven't seen it yet, but it's coming down the road, and there'll be one bank, one credit card, one of everything.
[00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:30.093]  And if you cross that bank and don't do what they want, or the owners want, you'll lose your credit card privilege, and you won't be able to buy or sell.
[00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:36.507]  Now let's fast forward 24 years, or 23 years to 2010.
[00:12:36.507 --> 00:12:42.915]  I now have London Guardian, Associated Press headlines, Rothschild's established global environment bank.
[00:12:42.915 --> 00:12:45.599]  Rothschild's established global carbon credit bank.
[00:12:45.939 --> 00:12:48.000]  Yes, that's what I want people to wake up at.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.681]  This is a conspiracy going on.
[00:12:50.681 --> 00:12:52.242]  It's no longer a conspiracy theory, it's a conspiracy fact.
[00:13:15.555 --> 00:13:16.656]  Okay, so continue.
[00:13:16.656 --> 00:13:24.979]  So you're at the meeting, you're at the table with the Rothschilds, because by twist of fate, you got the ticket or the seat of one of the presenters who had the flu.
[00:13:24.979 --> 00:13:27.020]  Go ahead.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:37.124]  Then my fellow workers came up to me and they said, George, we have to talk to you about something.
[00:13:37.124 --> 00:13:43.386]  David Rockefeller has sent us a message that if you don't keep your mouth shut, you're going to regret it.
[00:13:43.386 --> 00:13:44.487]  Shortly after that,
[00:13:45.151 --> 00:13:51.413]  After the meeting, I was talking with a talk show host and he said, did you get Guillain-Barré syndrome yet?
[00:13:51.413 --> 00:13:53.354]  And I said, what are you talking about?
[00:13:53.354 --> 00:13:54.814]  He said, GBS.
[00:13:54.814 --> 00:13:58.776]  It seems like everyone that gets close to the bone with World Order gets it.
[00:13:58.776 --> 00:14:01.777]  Well, I just got out of the hospital with GBS.
[00:14:01.777 --> 00:14:04.518]  So there is something there, don't you think?
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:15.645]  Oh, we know they have a lot of programs with soft kill weapons, but expanding on this, because you got the video out of there at other events, so out of the gate... I got the tape of the events.
[00:14:15.645 --> 00:14:18.066]  As far as I know, it's the only tape in existence.
[00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:20.232]  I can't figure that out.
[00:14:43.682 --> 00:14:46.624]  Uh, first of all, I hadn't done anything wrong, though.
[00:14:46.624 --> 00:14:51.707]  I was an official host, and I... So why was David Rockefeller telling you to shut up?
[00:14:51.707 --> 00:14:59.491]  Why was... I had a regular, uh, uh, regular, uh, association with Maury Strong there.
[00:14:59.491 --> 00:15:07.997]  Now, then, after the Congress, I went down, uh, some Christians down in San Luis Valley called me, and they said, George, you have to come down here.
[00:15:07.997 --> 00:15:10.278]  Maury Strong is up to all kinds of tricks.
[00:15:11.087 --> 00:15:24.932]  And that's where I was able to, through them, expose Maurice Strong's water scam that he was going to pump water to cities and turn the San Luis Valley, thousands of miles, into a dust bowl.
[00:15:24.932 --> 00:15:37.917]  So here's the convener of the Environment Congress that met in Estes Park, going down 200 miles to the San Luis Valley and turning the place into a dust bowl.
[00:15:38.517 --> 00:15:47.827]  It was that hypocrisy that caused me to invest up to now $250,000 in exposing this guy.
[00:15:47.827 --> 00:15:57.758]  And I've got some information today for you that it's going to blow him out of the water.
[00:15:57.758 --> 00:15:58.339]  Amazing.
[00:15:58.339 --> 00:15:59.220]  So, so again,
[00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:07.831]  Now we see it all over the news how the UN and big corporations are grabbing up the water in the third world, the first world, developing world, cutting it off.
[00:16:07.831 --> 00:16:09.772]  That's now mainstream news.
[00:16:09.772 --> 00:16:14.893]  Here you are in the late 80s seeing this at its embryonic formation.
[00:16:14.893 --> 00:16:15.853]  Yes.
[00:16:15.853 --> 00:16:19.274]  I saw it as an embryo and now I'm seeing it as an ugly fetus.
[00:16:21.607 --> 00:16:26.971]  Now from the videos and audios I've seen of you, you then found out about this.
[00:16:26.971 --> 00:16:29.213]  We'll continue with that first conference, what they said.
[00:16:29.213 --> 00:16:31.975]  We've got a bunch of audio clips here.
[00:16:31.975 --> 00:16:35.998]  But continue into other meetings that you were able to infiltrate.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:43.525]  Oh, I've infiltrated many meetings, but not one of this importance.
[00:16:43.525 --> 00:16:58.978]  Because the Secretary of the Treasury Baker was there, the head of the IMF, the head of the World Bank, Rothschild, Edmund Rothschild, the chief banker of the world, David Rockefeller, da-da-da-da-da, and I knew there was something going on.
[00:16:58.978 --> 00:17:01.580]  It would take an idiot not to understand it.
[00:17:02.527 --> 00:17:04.968]  And again, you're on record as being part of the conference.
[00:17:04.968 --> 00:17:07.269]  You got the documents out.
[00:17:07.269 --> 00:17:11.111]  Later newspapers, major newspapers have written stories about it.
[00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:13.652]  On the Ventura TV show, they showed those.
[00:17:13.652 --> 00:17:17.814]  I mean, this was a stroke of divine intervention.
[00:17:17.814 --> 00:17:18.514]  It was God.
[00:17:18.514 --> 00:17:22.196]  It was what you call an incident, coincidence.
[00:17:22.196 --> 00:17:27.598]  Because I received a prophecy in the Christian Church about 12 years earlier that I was going to do this.
[00:17:28.527 --> 00:17:30.929]  So, it was a piece of cake.
[00:17:30.929 --> 00:17:35.573]  I walked through it without any fear, and knowing that God was on my side.
[00:17:35.573 --> 00:17:44.099]  Wait a minute, so someone told you specifically, or did you recognize what was happening as it was happening, or did you like, after the fact, go, oh my God?
[00:17:44.099 --> 00:17:45.921]  It was later, after the fact.
[00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:47.602]  This is a prophecy.
[00:17:47.602 --> 00:17:49.984]  We are going into the wilderness.
[00:17:49.984 --> 00:17:52.826]  We are going on an adventure together into the wilderness.
[00:17:54.608 --> 00:17:59.271]  I am going to loose you upon the ravenous beasts of the world.
[00:17:59.271 --> 00:18:03.254]  And then you will return to me, and I will protect you.
[00:18:03.254 --> 00:18:06.335]  I am your jailer for your good and mine.
[00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:07.896]  And that was the prophecy.
[00:18:07.896 --> 00:18:17.322]  And then after I went to the Wilderness Congress, I realized I had been in the wilderness, and he was loosening me up on the ravenous beasts of the world.
[00:18:17.322 --> 00:18:18.563]  I knew them face to face.
[00:18:19.602 --> 00:18:20.062]  Amazing.
[00:18:20.062 --> 00:18:21.663]  Now, let's go back to this meeting, though.
[00:18:21.663 --> 00:18:23.463]  This key meeting you got into.
[00:18:23.463 --> 00:18:25.424]  Then you went and witnessed their sub-meetings.
[00:18:25.424 --> 00:18:30.966]  So, go over again the date, the time, the place, and who was there.
[00:18:30.966 --> 00:18:32.927]  Okay.
[00:18:32.927 --> 00:18:45.851]  David Rockefeller, Edmund de Rothschild, Secretary of the Treasury Baker, head of the IMF, don't remember his name, head of the World Bank, the head of the United Nations in Geneva.
[00:18:45.851 --> 00:18:48.452]  I had dinner with him one night.
[00:18:48.452 --> 00:18:49.012]  He kind of
[00:18:50.145 --> 00:18:55.347]  I found out that my questions were a little too close to the goal.
[00:18:55.347 --> 00:19:00.648]  Then there were the Smokies were there, all the four strangers.
[00:19:00.648 --> 00:19:07.070]  Of course, Maurice Strong was there as a Secretary General, convening this Congress.
[00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:18.094]  And girl Harlem Bruteland, I think of her as kind of a concentration camp lady because she's in charge of reducing the population of the world.
[00:19:18.094 --> 00:19:19.174]  That's what her job is.
[00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:24.425]  She was the head of the World Health Organization for about six years.
[00:19:24.425 --> 00:19:33.792]  And she is also a member of a new club with Jimmy Carter and Tutu and some other people.
[00:19:33.792 --> 00:19:36.014]  It's called The Elders.
[00:19:36.014 --> 00:19:40.617]  And The Elders have direct contact with the Club of Rome.
[00:19:40.617 --> 00:19:42.018]  All right, stay there.
[00:19:42.018 --> 00:19:42.639]  We got a break.
[00:19:42.639 --> 00:19:45.021]  Let's continue along that line.
[00:19:45.021 --> 00:19:46.482]  And then other meetings you went to.
[00:19:46.482 --> 00:19:49.104]  Just amazing stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:50.544 --> 00:19:57.168]  Uh, I mean, there's, you know, videos out there of our guests introducing Maury Strong and the rest of them right in the middle of all of this.
[00:19:57.168 --> 00:20:00.249]  This is an absolute eyewitness on the inside.
[00:20:00.249 --> 00:20:03.631]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:20:03.631 --> 00:20:07.532]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:20:07.532 --> 00:20:13.135]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride and less than 2 cents per gallon?
[00:20:13.135 --> 00:20:19.118]  Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants
[00:20:19.198 --> 00:20:19.578]  I think so.
[00:20:44.387 --> 00:20:48.890]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.212]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:20:51.212 --> 00:20:52.593]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:21:10.678 --> 00:21:13.361]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:19.746]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:21:19.746 --> 00:21:24.811]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:21:24.811 --> 00:21:34.920]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.381]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:21:37.381 --> 00:21:38.961]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:21:38.961 --> 00:21:41.422]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:21:41.422 --> 00:21:43.543]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:21:43.543 --> 00:21:48.705]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:21:48.705 --> 00:21:53.707]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:21:53.707 --> 00:21:57.808]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:59.941 --> 00:22:06.606]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:06.606 --> 00:22:14.731]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:14.731 --> 00:22:20.295]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[00:22:20.635 --> 00:22:22.897]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:22:22.897 --> 00:22:27.980]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:33.204]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.204 --> 00:22:36.927]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:37.547 --> 00:22:38.628]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:38.628 --> 00:22:43.130]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:48.033]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:51.035]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:51.035 --> 00:22:52.816]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.816 --> 00:22:53.036]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.514 --> 00:22:59.834]  I'm good.
[00:23:14.889 --> 00:23:15.530]  We're good to go.
[00:23:32.628 --> 00:23:33.129]  I think so.
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:07.382]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.382 --> 00:24:09.662]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:31.209 --> 00:24:35.191]  Okay, George, I've been throwing a lot of questions in here and you're dropping bombshell after bombshell.
[00:24:35.191 --> 00:24:37.092]  So you're at this UN conference.
[00:24:37.092 --> 00:24:47.118]  Of course, Maurice Strong was later the head of the official biological diversity meeting in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, the Earth Summit.
[00:24:47.118 --> 00:24:51.520]  He's the guy that says publicly we must destroy the industrial society for Gaia.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.142]  Now Al Gore's new film and book is about religion.
[00:24:54.142 --> 00:24:56.663]  We're going to get into the religious aspect of this and
[00:24:57.143 --> 00:24:59.565]  Weird occult compounds he's got in Colorado.
[00:24:59.565 --> 00:25:04.890]  But continuing, you were getting into this woman, the head of the World Health Organization, and the U.N.
[00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.452]  stated goal of reducing world population of 80%.
[00:25:07.452 --> 00:25:08.573]  Go ahead.
[00:25:08.573 --> 00:25:12.596]  Yes, her name is Gro Harlem Bruteland.
[00:25:12.596 --> 00:25:23.025]  She prepared the Bruteland Report, which was used as the basis of the Fourth World Wilderness Congress Foundation.
[00:25:23.025 --> 00:25:24.086]  The Bruteland Report.
[00:25:24.793 --> 00:25:31.394]  And her analysis is that 2 billion people have to be removed from the planet.
[00:25:31.394 --> 00:25:34.615]  2 billion.
[00:25:34.615 --> 00:25:39.276]  Now there's other figures that go down as low as 500 million.
[00:25:39.276 --> 00:25:51.418]  So we have a sinister element in our government that is twisting the laws so that they can annihilate people early.
[00:25:52.679 --> 00:25:59.363]  They say the globe, the Earth, is not large enough for 6 billion people.
[00:25:59.363 --> 00:26:04.306]  Now, I take issue with that because I'm one of the guys that will be cooked.
[00:26:04.306 --> 00:26:07.888]  So you can see I do have a selfish motive in fighting all this stuff.
[00:26:07.888 --> 00:26:16.833]  Well, plus it's a fraudulent model and it's been proven these globalists have bigger carbon footprints and more children than even third world populations.
[00:26:16.833 --> 00:26:20.315]  I mean, these are a bunch of greedy people that want the Earth for themselves.
[00:26:21.474 --> 00:26:23.837]  Yes, they want the Earth for themselves.
[00:26:23.837 --> 00:26:26.160]  You got it right on the head.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.767]  And they don't like us cannon fodder that unfortunately populates the Earth.
[00:26:30.767 --> 00:26:33.610]  I've got a recording of that.
[00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:38.197]  An elitist banker from Canada actually saying that.
[00:26:40.355 --> 00:26:49.763]  Let's do this bank without telling the cannon fodder about it that unfortunately inhabits the earth.
[00:26:49.763 --> 00:26:54.006]  That's when I said, I'm going to make war on these guys.
[00:26:54.006 --> 00:26:58.270]  And I haven't stopped for 22 years.
[00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:00.912]  Well, you've done a great job exposing them.
[00:27:00.912 --> 00:27:02.373]  I want to continue here.
[00:27:02.373 --> 00:27:04.475]  Okay.
[00:27:04.475 --> 00:27:08.378]  So how did the conference end and then what other conferences did you attend?
[00:27:10.542 --> 00:27:25.096]  Okay, the Congress ended by Rothschild presenting his banking program to the Congress to grow Harlem Bruinland to present to the United Nations in October of 1987.
[00:27:25.096 --> 00:27:30.981]  That was the end of it.
[00:27:30.981 --> 00:27:31.802]  Now since then,
[00:27:33.359 --> 00:27:42.321]  You know, everyone's complaining about Maury Strong allegedly taking a $1 million bribe from the U.N.
[00:27:42.321 --> 00:27:44.762]  and the Oil for Food Program.
[00:27:44.762 --> 00:27:57.584]  And Fox just fouled him up by exposing him to the Copenhagen Congress.
[00:27:57.584 --> 00:27:59.225]  He made billions there.
[00:27:59.225 --> 00:28:01.085]  And I'll announce it to you right now.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:10.447]  He got eight million dollars when he sold the Vaca for water rights which he did not own.
[00:28:10.447 --> 00:28:30.782]  In other words, it seems to me that there was fraud committed either at the Nature Conservancy level or Cabesa de Vaca Land Company level, but someone can easily find that eight million dollars that he got and I hereby blow the whistle on it.
[00:28:31.468 --> 00:28:40.194]  Well, here's that Fox News report on global warming, follow the money, and it talks about Maury Strong and everything he's been involved in.
[00:28:40.194 --> 00:28:48.560]  And I know these fake conservancy groups in Austin, with the city, took more than 15,000 acres from people and didn't pay them one-tenth of what it was worth.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:53.164]  Then they turned around a few years later and took the restrictions off and built on it themselves.
[00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.932]  See, that's the kind of stuff they do.
[00:28:55.932 --> 00:29:05.703]  They manure themselves through these institutions and acronymical corporations like ABC Corporation.
[00:29:05.703 --> 00:29:08.386]  And you can't follow their trail.
[00:29:08.386 --> 00:29:14.433]  Maurice Strong tried to bury his trail when he left the United States in a hurry.
[00:29:15.205 --> 00:29:26.024]  Because I reported him to the Congress for tacking a rider onto the quadrennial water bill that would allow growth and development to the UC Aquifers.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:35.786]  And that issue, which would have passed if I hadn't written to the congressman until 2am in the morning.
[00:29:35.786 --> 00:29:46.895]  If I hadn't written to him, they would have passed it and AWDI, Maury Strong's company, would have been off and rolling to... Alright, George, stay there.
[00:29:46.895 --> 00:29:48.176]  Good job fighting that.
[00:29:48.176 --> 00:29:50.277]  Long segment coming up.
[00:29:50.277 --> 00:29:51.659]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.659 --> 00:29:54.200]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.863]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.236 --> 00:30:03.237]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.237 --> 00:30:08.579]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:08.579 --> 00:30:10.620]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:15.621]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:15.621 --> 00:30:16.802]  How much do you want?
[00:30:16.802 --> 00:30:17.922]  When do you want it?
[00:30:17.922 --> 00:30:19.803]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:19.803 --> 00:30:20.883]  When will you need it?
[00:30:20.883 --> 00:30:23.084]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.084 --> 00:30:24.425]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:24.425 --> 00:30:25.725]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:25.945 --> 00:30:31.212]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.212 --> 00:30:34.797]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:34.797 --> 00:30:38.622]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:38.622 --> 00:30:39.864]  How much will you need?
[00:30:39.864 --> 00:30:40.765]  We don't know.
[00:30:40.765 --> 00:30:41.867]  How much do you want?
[00:30:41.867 --> 00:30:42.788]  All you can get.
[00:30:42.788 --> 00:30:43.609]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:43.869 --> 00:30:46.910]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:54.452]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:54.452 --> 00:31:01.394]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.394 --> 00:31:05.395]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:05.395 --> 00:31:08.636]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:08.636 --> 00:31:10.056]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:31:10.777 --> 00:31:13.438]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:19.819]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:19.819 --> 00:31:25.201]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:25.201 --> 00:31:28.281]  All of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:31:28.281 --> 00:31:35.003]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.123 --> 00:31:37.465]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:37.465 --> 00:31:39.066]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.066 --> 00:31:41.527]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:41.527 --> 00:31:43.648]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:43.648 --> 00:31:48.812]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:48.812 --> 00:31:58.157]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:00.985 --> 00:32:01.785]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:32:01.785 --> 00:32:05.086]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:32:05.086 --> 00:32:10.368]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[00:32:10.368 --> 00:32:16.110]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:23.712]  We would intend not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[00:32:23.712 --> 00:32:28.594]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the bread line may have no bread.
[00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:37.052]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[00:32:37.052 --> 00:32:42.154]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[00:32:42.154 --> 00:32:42.454]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:32:42.454 --> 00:32:42.534]  800-409-5633.
[00:32:42.534 --> 00:32:43.514]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:43.514 --> 00:32:43.735]  Who am I?
[00:32:43.735 --> 00:32:44.315]  Someone who cares.
[00:33:14.033 --> 00:33:17.415]  TheBigBadBank.com is his website.
[00:33:17.415 --> 00:33:18.296]  He's George Hunt.
[00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:21.458]  Again, TheBigBadBank.com.
[00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:22.519]  One word.
[00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:22.999]  Check it out.
[00:33:22.999 --> 00:33:26.742]  We'll tell you about a great documentary he produced coming up later that you can get on the site.
[00:33:27.242 --> 00:33:28.503]  TheBigBadBank.com.
[00:33:28.503 --> 00:33:37.506]  Of course, our websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, as well as InfoWars.net, and WhatIsTheEndgame.com.
[00:33:37.506 --> 00:33:44.949]  My film, Endgame, exposes this globalist dehumanization agenda that they're pushing through the phony environmental movement.
[00:33:44.949 --> 00:33:47.330]  This is the religion of the big bankers.
[00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.611]  We're going to get into their religion, what makes them tick.
[00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:52.652]  George Hunt has tracked them, been in their meetings, been around them.
[00:33:53.252 --> 00:33:55.954]  By a twist of fate and the good lord above.
[00:33:55.954 --> 00:34:01.998]  We've got a bunch of audio clips we're going to be playing and getting his take on that as well.
[00:34:01.998 --> 00:34:08.563]  But for years he was exposing Maury Strong before it ever even became a mainstream media issue.
[00:34:08.563 --> 00:34:17.229]  But give me a document cam shot for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and for radio listeners, I'll give you these headlines so you can check them out for yourself.
[00:34:18.287 --> 00:34:25.190]  The article he mentioned from Fox with Maury Strong being confronted by the news for making lots of money off of Copenhagen.
[00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:27.251]  So that's going on.
[00:34:27.251 --> 00:34:28.772]  Here's an article out of Reuters.
[00:34:28.772 --> 00:34:34.275]  Rothschild E3 launched carbon credit investment fund that people will pay their taxes to.
[00:34:34.275 --> 00:34:36.075]  That's Reuters.
[00:34:36.075 --> 00:34:38.276]  Everything he was talking about 20 years ago.
[00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:40.417]  Here's another one.
[00:34:40.417 --> 00:34:43.519]  Maury Strong linked to all these bizarre cults.
[00:34:44.338 --> 00:34:49.500]  We're going to be covering that with him as well, his wife, setting up a Gaia Earth religion.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:35:06.345]  The UN said in 96 in their biological diversity assessment, and I even have a clip of them at the UN saying, we must worship our mother goddess, and now they're teaching the children these chants in public schools and private schools that are accredited, and they now admit it's going to be a global religion.
[00:35:06.345 --> 00:35:09.326]  In fact, where are those magazines I had in here?
[00:35:09.326 --> 00:35:10.587]  I guess I've already cleaned it up.
[00:35:10.587 --> 00:35:12.227]  Will you ask Aaron, because he took them out?
[00:35:12.227 --> 00:35:13.508]  No, no, no, here they are.
[00:35:13.508 --> 00:35:13.868]  Here they are.
[00:35:15.014 --> 00:35:16.535]  Look at this.
[00:35:16.535 --> 00:35:19.117]  There's so many of these, I just thought to show you this.
[00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:31.005]  Here is Outside Magazine likening the new heir of the Rothschild family, the son of the person that George Hunt was exposing.
[00:35:31.005 --> 00:35:34.988]  Here he is, the hero Gene, how to tap into yours.
[00:35:34.988 --> 00:35:39.611]  And then you open it up and it talks about him being like Jesus.
[00:35:39.611 --> 00:35:40.272]  You open it up.
[00:35:40.973 --> 00:35:46.115]  And it talks about him being a Christ figure.
[00:35:46.115 --> 00:35:49.976]  I mean, this is just so incredibly sickening.
[00:35:49.976 --> 00:35:51.196]  They're calling Jesus here.
[00:35:51.196 --> 00:35:52.557]  Give me a close shot of this.
[00:35:52.557 --> 00:35:54.417]  Plastics Jesus.
[00:35:54.417 --> 00:35:55.498]  The Savior.
[00:35:55.498 --> 00:35:56.238]  How to be a hero.
[00:36:00.882 --> 00:36:02.823]  Again, here they are on the cover of the magazine.
[00:36:02.823 --> 00:36:04.043]  The hero gene.
[00:36:04.043 --> 00:36:04.963]  How to tap into the earth.
[00:36:04.963 --> 00:36:06.424]  This is your role model.
[00:36:06.424 --> 00:36:12.466]  The guy that got on my show, he's openly called for global government by the way at Copenhagen on Bloomberg TV.
[00:36:12.466 --> 00:36:18.727]  A guy who got on my show and I said, well Mars' ice caps have been getting smaller too from solar system warming from the sun.
[00:36:18.727 --> 00:36:20.448]  And he said, well that's because Mars is closer
[00:36:21.132 --> 00:36:22.393]  To the sun and earth.
[00:36:22.393 --> 00:36:24.774]  And I said, no it's not, it's the next planet out.
[00:36:24.774 --> 00:36:25.775]  Then it's the gas giants.
[00:36:25.775 --> 00:36:27.716]  He said, no it's not, and laughed at me.
[00:36:27.716 --> 00:36:29.177]  He was laughing at the audience.
[00:36:29.177 --> 00:36:31.158]  He thinks you're like the general public.
[00:36:31.158 --> 00:36:31.738]  Here's another one.
[00:36:31.738 --> 00:36:33.720]  The thinking man's thinking man.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.061]  The eco-prophet gets real.
[00:36:36.061 --> 00:36:37.142]  Al Gore.
[00:36:37.142 --> 00:36:38.863]  See, he's a prophet.
[00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:40.103]  It's all a religion.
[00:36:40.103 --> 00:36:41.484]  But that's coming up.
[00:36:41.484 --> 00:36:45.287]  And he's going to be with us at least 20 minutes to the next hour because there's so many facets to cover.
[00:36:45.287 --> 00:36:49.129]  George Hunt, before we get into the religious angle, and the scams they're running,
[00:36:49.941 --> 00:37:04.009]  I want to play some audio clips and get into some of the other questions you sent me that you think are important to get into, but working with them, being around them, and finding out who they were, tracking them, what is their bottom line?
[00:37:04.009 --> 00:37:17.417]  I mean, I don't know if you've seen my film, Endgame, but from the UN documents, from their statements, it's a planetary dictatorship to then carry out the orderly extermination of at least 80% of the world population.
[00:37:17.417 --> 00:37:18.598]  You know, you caught me
[00:37:20.121 --> 00:37:21.442]  Uh, at a standstill.
[00:37:21.442 --> 00:37:24.684]  I'm not familiar with that.
[00:37:24.684 --> 00:37:27.406]  Well, I need to send you a copy of my film, Endgame.
[00:37:27.406 --> 00:37:30.789]  But specifically, there are plans for population reduction.
[00:37:30.789 --> 00:37:33.310]  Did you ever run into that?
[00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:35.532]  Well, um, I have.
[00:37:35.532 --> 00:37:36.373]  Yes, I have.
[00:37:36.373 --> 00:37:39.935]  But, uh, it's rather grim.
[00:37:39.935 --> 00:37:45.539]  I believe that World Health Organization has included an AIDS
[00:37:49.269 --> 00:37:54.730]  Virus into their inoculations that they're doing for the good of mankind, of course.
[00:37:54.730 --> 00:38:00.552]  And that's why we're seeing the population dying of AIDS in Africa.
[00:38:00.552 --> 00:38:01.432]  Well, they've been caught.
[00:38:01.432 --> 00:38:02.412]  Yes, that's on record.
[00:38:02.412 --> 00:38:08.314]  A sister country of Rwanda said the bank credit Leone's.
[00:38:08.314 --> 00:38:13.955]  They've since gone out of business, but they're the ones that financed the Rwandan massacre.
[00:38:14.577 --> 00:38:25.301]  They sent it to the president of Rwanda, who was working with them, and, you know, I come across these terrible things that are going on in the planet, even while we speak.
[00:38:25.301 --> 00:38:26.922]  It's terrible.
[00:38:26.922 --> 00:38:37.306]  Well, we know the UN was involved in financing the Rwandan massacre of Christians because they wanted their property for big oil companies and mining companies and financed by banks.
[00:38:37.306 --> 00:38:40.207]  I'm not particularly familiar with the bank you mentioned, but
[00:38:40.956 --> 00:38:43.438]  What type of world do they want to build?
[00:38:43.438 --> 00:38:48.541]  And how are they using environmentalism to sell the public on giving up their rights?
[00:38:48.541 --> 00:38:55.326]  They are gearing society towards a feudalistic society, in my opinion.
[00:38:56.112 --> 00:39:05.716]  Where they'll have lords of the manors, the Duchess of Boulder and the Queen of Las Vegas.
[00:39:05.716 --> 00:39:08.717]  They'll adopt titles and stuff.
[00:39:08.717 --> 00:39:15.700]  They'll go into a feudalistic society similar to what we had in the Middle Ages.
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:20.582]  And they will also introduce the worship of Mother Earth as part of the religion.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:28.987]  Uh, so that we will somehow tie in the religion with acceptance of the world order.
[00:39:28.987 --> 00:39:31.930]  Uh, that's all I can say vaguely about where they're headed.
[00:39:33.795 --> 00:39:52.817]  Now I've got these audio clips and then I want to get into some of their religious beliefs and I mean having psychics vet you to be able to go to the conference, the secret conference, I mean just the bizarreness and that sounds crazy to people that don't research them, but openly UN documents talk about the occult and how much they believe in it.
[00:39:53.722 --> 00:39:57.106]  Uh, what would you, how would you sum up their earth religion?
[00:39:57.106 --> 00:39:59.449]  I mean, because that's a broad title, earth religion.
[00:39:59.449 --> 00:40:02.612]  We see the new movie Avatar, it's all about earth religion.
[00:40:02.612 --> 00:40:08.279]  Uh, but, but I mean, how would you sum up their, their earth religion?
[00:40:08.279 --> 00:40:14.826]  Honey Strong, Maury Strong's wife, is the head of the earth religion cult.
[00:40:15.798 --> 00:40:24.760]  Uh, she, uh, Creston, Colorado has been chosen as the center because that is where the Eastern religions meet the Western religions.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:38.743]  They say that's the point there where God is going to, uh, going to have sexual intercourse with Mother Earth to bring forth the Christ.
[00:40:38.743 --> 00:40:42.464]  That's what they believe.
[00:40:42.464 --> 00:40:42.684]  Hello?
[00:40:45.694 --> 00:40:47.402]  Did I knock you off your seat?
[00:40:47.402 --> 00:40:49.069]  No, no, it's... I mean, I'm listening.
[00:40:51.875 --> 00:40:52.595]  Okay.
[00:40:52.595 --> 00:40:52.856]  No, no, no.
[00:40:52.856 --> 00:40:54.176]  I mean, I've been to Bohemian Grove.
[00:40:54.176 --> 00:40:55.016]  I infiltrated it.
[00:40:55.016 --> 00:40:59.358]  And they address the owl as an owl, then as a bull, as Moloch.
[00:40:59.358 --> 00:41:01.079]  They address it as male and female.
[00:41:01.079 --> 00:41:02.360]  The owl is the female.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.181]  And the cults are all a little bit different.
[00:41:06.181 --> 00:41:08.142]  And then the bull is the male.
[00:41:08.142 --> 00:41:15.886]  And they talk about how they sacrifice children and goodly tire, that's a quote, to the Moloch, the bull.
[00:41:15.886 --> 00:41:18.107]  But then they also address it as a female.
[00:41:18.107 --> 00:41:20.448]  And so they always see it as the horned god, the male,
[00:41:21.388 --> 00:41:24.549]  Yeah, you've got the core of it right there, Alex.
[00:41:24.549 --> 00:41:25.950]  But it's starting in Maury's strong country.
[00:41:43.192 --> 00:41:53.469]  And we've learned already we can't trust him, so you know that this religion, and they will get it through, you know, the Big Brother religion, they will...
[00:41:54.423 --> 00:42:02.046]  Well, he's also on audio at huge elementary school conferences and the auditorium saying, tell your parents what to do.
[00:42:18.147 --> 00:42:21.048]  They don't know you're the boss in the New York Times reports.
[00:42:21.048 --> 00:42:26.328]  They've got kids all over the country writing mock tickets to their parents for taking a hot bath.
[00:42:26.328 --> 00:42:27.229]  That's what they're going to do.
[00:42:27.229 --> 00:42:31.469]  They're going to train them to blow the whistle on their parents.
[00:42:31.469 --> 00:42:33.010]  Same thing that you read.
[00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:36.450]  I urge your listeners to reread 1984.
[00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:41.531]  There are a lot of parallels there.
[00:42:41.531 --> 00:42:42.831]  Including the earth religion.
[00:42:42.831 --> 00:42:44.372]  In 1984 they worship Big Brother.
[00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:51.214]  But, uh, in this case, it'll be Big Sister.
[00:42:51.214 --> 00:43:03.788]  Well, we have another article at jonesreport.com that's a scan from this Outside Magazine article, and it's got a photo of David the Rothschild wearing a skull and bones belt.
[00:43:03.788 --> 00:43:07.592]  It says he's Jesus, but he's also wearing a skull and crossbones belt.
[00:43:07.592 --> 00:43:08.153]  What do you think of that?
[00:43:09.147 --> 00:43:14.490]  Well, as a Christian, I would immediately be repulsed by it.
[00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:18.333]  I don't know what he was saying to the public.
[00:43:18.333 --> 00:43:25.297]  I didn't know if he was mocking Jesus Christ like some of the Orthodox Jews do.
[00:43:25.297 --> 00:43:34.323]  But the gist is that they're out to capture the minds of people.
[00:43:34.323 --> 00:43:36.504]  This is a mind game that we're involved in.
[00:43:37.745 --> 00:43:38.886]  InfoWars.
[00:43:38.886 --> 00:43:45.030]  Yeah, they use guilt over the environment to sell people into giving up their rights to them.
[00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:50.674]  Giving up their rights to the state, but in this case to Gaia, Mother Earth.
[00:43:50.674 --> 00:43:52.315]  And they'll be rewarded for it.
[00:43:52.315 --> 00:43:59.480]  They'll get a razor blade, uh, uh, ration that's special because they worship Mother Earth.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:03.582]  But if you don't worship Mother Earth, you're toast.
[00:44:03.582 --> 00:44:04.503]  By the way, by the way...
[00:44:06.269 --> 00:44:08.972]  Because the bank won't give you those privileges.
[00:44:08.972 --> 00:44:10.974]  It all works together.
[00:44:10.974 --> 00:44:16.720]  By the way, I'm- For a very, uh, uh, humongous society controlling us.
[00:44:17.546 --> 00:44:25.669]  Well, going back to what you just said, the BBC this weekend had a headline, that I showed people yesterday, where they said, rationing is needed.
[00:44:25.669 --> 00:44:36.012]  A credit ration on your card, like you said 20 years ago, that they said, now they're openly proposing, you'll have a card, and it has your rations on it for everyone, for the Earth.
[00:44:36.012 --> 00:44:40.113]  Every can of corn or beans will have a tax on it as well.
[00:44:40.113 --> 00:44:44.594]  But even if you have the money to buy it, you won't get it when your carbon credits run out.
[00:44:44.594 --> 00:44:45.915]  I mean, this is neo-feudalism.
[00:44:45.915 --> 00:44:46.575]  This is serfdom.
[00:44:47.426 --> 00:44:48.306]  That's right.
[00:44:48.306 --> 00:44:55.710]  They're going to tax each can of beans or corn or whatever you have.
[00:44:55.710 --> 00:45:02.113]  They're going to determine how much of Mother Earth went into the growth of this product.
[00:45:02.113 --> 00:45:04.954]  And they're going to add that to the cost of the product.
[00:45:06.912 --> 00:45:08.953]  As if life hurts life.
[00:45:08.953 --> 00:45:14.177]  The whole process of life and death and regeneration of food is what the life cycle is.
[00:45:14.177 --> 00:45:22.582]  By taxing carbon dioxide that plants breathe, that all animals exhale, they can corner the entire life cycle.
[00:45:22.582 --> 00:45:25.104]  Yes, that's what they say.
[00:45:25.104 --> 00:45:36.131]  In fact, Rothschild said that he wanted to capture all of the carbon dioxide, turn it into dry ice, and ship the dry ice to the polar caps to keep them from melting.
[00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:39.491]  And of course he's going to take care of it.
[00:45:39.491 --> 00:45:43.234]  And of course he would make the money off of doing that.
[00:45:43.234 --> 00:45:44.074]  Excuse me, go ahead.
[00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:49.338]  And of course he would make the money off of that, like Bill Gates patenting all this stuff to stop carbon dioxide.
[00:45:49.338 --> 00:45:54.802]  Oh yeah, it would take a lot of dry ice to keep the polar caps from melting.
[00:45:54.802 --> 00:45:59.645]  What about Bill and Melinda Gates and their eugenics foundation?
[00:45:59.645 --> 00:46:00.386]  Do you ever run into that?
[00:46:01.101 --> 00:46:03.242]  No, I have the Gates Foundation.
[00:46:03.242 --> 00:46:03.762]  Yes.
[00:46:03.762 --> 00:46:04.602]  I have run it.
[00:46:04.602 --> 00:46:10.604]  I think it's a specific, it's a passive organization that Bill Gates has.
[00:46:10.604 --> 00:46:14.666]  He doesn't seem like he's a killer or anything like that.
[00:46:14.666 --> 00:46:16.706]  Well, we've done research on it.
[00:46:16.706 --> 00:46:19.147]  It's carefully guarded and we've had some internal whistleblowers.
[00:46:19.147 --> 00:46:29.751]  I mean, you know his dad was the former head of Planned Parenthood and he is for population reduction and he's busy inoculating little children.
[00:46:29.751 --> 00:46:29.831]  Oh.
[00:46:30.777 --> 00:46:31.418]  I didn't know that.
[00:46:51.135 --> 00:46:57.719]  Not to the spiritual part, but just keep on going and maybe I can add some things to your talk.
[00:46:57.719 --> 00:46:59.640]  Okay, you sent me 19 clips.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:10.987]  We can play any of these clips you want, but I'm going to go ahead and play Maury Strong, Banking Principles, because it all sounds slick and sweet and loving, but you can break down what he really means by that.
[00:47:10.987 --> 00:47:15.529]  And now 27 years later, we can see it's all been proven you were correct in what you got from this.
[00:47:15.529 --> 00:47:18.331]  But here's Maury Strong that you recorded at one of the meetings.
[00:47:18.331 --> 00:47:18.711]  Here it is.
[00:47:19.767 --> 00:47:31.753]  Now, all I'm saying, really, is that there are many areas in which it is possible to apply banking principles.
[00:47:31.753 --> 00:47:33.934]  Michael Sweetman is a banker.
[00:47:33.934 --> 00:47:36.735]  He's run major banking organizations.
[00:47:36.735 --> 00:47:46.180]  And when he proposed this idea, he'll have to talk for himself, but my understanding of it was that it was meant to tap new sources of funding.
[00:47:46.809 --> 00:48:03.214]  To channel into these areas in which an important conservation objective can be achieved in a manner compatible with an economic return, a bankable economic return.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:05.294]  Okay, now we see that today.
[00:48:05.294 --> 00:48:13.037]  Later in clips they talk about every corporation and company having to give money to this bank that will then save the environment.
[00:48:13.037 --> 00:48:14.217]  Comments on that, George Hunt?
[00:48:17.145 --> 00:48:19.908]  Would you repeat that question, Alex?
[00:48:19.908 --> 00:48:21.469]  Can we turn our audio up to you?
[00:48:21.469 --> 00:48:29.738]  I was saying, in these clips, they're talking about banking principles.
[00:48:29.738 --> 00:48:30.539]  Comments on that?
[00:48:31.890 --> 00:48:39.436]  Uh, I think if I, if I played the first clip for you, it would make it clearer to your audience.
[00:48:39.436 --> 00:48:41.077]  Okay, let's play clip number one.
[00:48:41.077 --> 00:48:43.619]  Michael Sweetman introduces the bank.
[00:48:43.619 --> 00:48:45.801]  Yeah, there might be more in there for you.
[00:48:45.801 --> 00:48:47.022]  Okay, okay.
[00:48:47.022 --> 00:48:48.423]  Here's that clip.
[00:48:48.423 --> 00:48:54.848]  One of the people probably still coming in, but I think we need to get on with the agenda.
[00:48:54.848 --> 00:48:57.730]  I'm going to, uh, ask, uh,
[00:48:58.186 --> 00:49:06.209]  I'm going to ask Maurice Strong to open the session with some remarks, and then I'm going to ask him to introduce Mr. Rothschild, on my left.
[00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:18.573]  And following some remarks from Mr. Rothschild, I'll briefly set the scene, and then I'm going to begin to open it to the floor and see if we can get some dialogue and get some responses and questions and some ideas from you.
[00:49:18.573 --> 00:49:20.554]  And we'll take it from there.
[00:49:20.554 --> 00:49:22.714]  We've got three days.
[00:49:22.714 --> 00:49:26.896]  We've got best topics we're dealing with, as the program indicates.
[00:49:27.779 --> 00:49:31.781]  We've got some very good people on these panels, and they've come a long way, some of them, to be here.
[00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:39.105]  And I really appreciate that, because, um, um, they clearly show, indicate an interest.
[00:49:39.105 --> 00:49:44.908]  And, uh, I think we're gonna have some very, a very interesting time over the next three days.
[00:49:44.908 --> 00:49:46.469]  But not just an interesting time.
[00:49:46.469 --> 00:49:49.771]  I hope we're gonna have a very productive time over the next three days.
[00:49:49.771 --> 00:49:56.054]  And we're gonna come out, uh, by tomorrow night, at any rate, with a resolution, which we have to hand to the Resolutions Committee.
[00:49:56.949 --> 00:50:01.911]  If we want a resolution about the World Conservation Bank in the Congress proceedings, and I hope, I trust that we do.
[00:50:01.911 --> 00:50:05.172]  So we've got to think about that as well.
[00:50:05.172 --> 00:50:12.014]  I suggest what we might do is to cover that at the end of these two sessions this afternoon, and maybe some... Alex, can you hear me?
[00:50:12.014 --> 00:50:18.116]  ...some of you might like to stay back and we could discuss how we proceed with that.
[00:50:18.116 --> 00:50:19.477]  Yes, George, I could hear you.
[00:50:19.477 --> 00:50:21.598]  We were finishing the clip you sent us.
[00:50:21.598 --> 00:50:23.418]  We're going to break, but... It was kind of long.
[00:50:23.418 --> 00:50:23.958]  I'm sorry.
[00:50:23.958 --> 00:50:24.679]  No, it's fine.
[00:50:24.679 --> 00:50:25.139]  It's good.
[00:50:25.139 --> 00:50:25.519]  It's great.
[00:50:26.318 --> 00:50:32.782]  When he introduced the bank, did you hear that we have to present this tomorrow?
[00:50:32.782 --> 00:50:37.184]  And so we convened here with you to get your ideas towards this bank?
[00:50:37.184 --> 00:50:39.406]  It was a con job.
[00:50:39.406 --> 00:50:48.511]  Sure, I mean the UN always has its plan already set and then they just have a meeting with some of the elitist and then it's already been ratified.
[00:50:48.511 --> 00:50:50.692]  Stay there, we're going to come back and go over more of this.
[00:50:50.692 --> 00:50:53.114]  We've got a bunch of clips coming up.
[00:50:53.114 --> 00:50:53.674]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.017 --> 00:51:00.697]  Hello.
[00:51:00.697 --> 00:51:05.441]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:51:05.441 --> 00:51:10.264]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:51:10.264 --> 00:51:15.047]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:51:15.407 --> 00:51:19.489]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[00:51:19.489 --> 00:51:23.530]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:26.331]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[00:51:26.331 --> 00:51:27.352]  It was empowering.
[00:51:27.352 --> 00:51:31.353]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[00:51:31.353 --> 00:51:34.174]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[00:51:34.174 --> 00:51:37.035]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[00:51:37.035 --> 00:51:38.015]  Thank you so much.
[00:51:38.015 --> 00:51:40.857]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[00:51:40.857 --> 00:51:41.617]  Thanks again.
[00:51:41.617 --> 00:51:44.238]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[00:51:44.989 --> 00:51:48.410]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:51.991]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:51:51.991 --> 00:51:55.993]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[00:52:01.332 --> 00:52:05.353]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.353 --> 00:52:08.594]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:08.594 --> 00:52:13.395]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:52:13.395 --> 00:52:19.797]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:19.797 --> 00:52:22.018]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:22.538 --> 00:52:24.179]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:24.179 --> 00:52:25.339]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:25.339 --> 00:52:27.900]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.500]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:30.941]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[00:52:47.106 --> 00:52:48.748]  A Fall of the Republic.
[00:52:48.748 --> 00:52:57.859]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:52:59.747 --> 00:53:03.290]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:05.592]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:53:05.592 --> 00:53:06.453]  Don't!
[00:53:06.453 --> 00:53:09.896]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:53:09.896 --> 00:53:17.022]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'

[00:53:18.984 --> 00:53:22.647]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:53:23.047 --> 00:53:26.190]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:33.558]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:53:33.558 --> 00:53:34.760]  Herb K was right.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.943]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:53:37.943 --> 00:53:39.304]  What have you got to lose?
[00:53:39.304 --> 00:53:42.428]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.

[00:53:47.373 --> 00:53:47.413]  888-352-7726.
[00:54:05.943 --> 00:54:18.792]  If you want to see this all put in context, folks, get the film Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement on DVD, two and a half hours long, 40 minutes of extras, their whole master plan, their own statements.
[00:54:18.792 --> 00:54:29.039]  We have George Hunt, who ended up in some of these meetings, high-level elite meetings by a twist of fate, and started investigating them, going to some of the sub-meetings over the years.
[00:54:29.039 --> 00:54:30.260]  He is with us today.
[00:54:31.315 --> 00:54:31.615]  Yes, he's a...
[00:54:55.706 --> 00:55:04.515]  International banker from Montreal, Canada, is a close friend of Michael Sweetman, the president of the World Conservation Bank.
[00:55:04.515 --> 00:55:06.397]  Okay, let's go ahead.
[00:55:06.397 --> 00:55:07.898]  Yeah, this is what he had to say about us.
[00:55:07.898 --> 00:55:09.260]  Here it is.
[00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:12.223]  This looks like David Lang from Montreal.
[00:55:12.223 --> 00:55:14.125]  He's always full of awkward questions.
[00:55:15.146 --> 00:55:21.168]  Until recently, on the balance sheet, there were billions of dollars still listed as existing, which have now been written off.
[00:55:21.168 --> 00:55:28.110]  And so those surpluses have a bad habit of disappearing when the auditor finally gets his hands into the balance sheet.
[00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:32.452]  I suggest, therefore, that this be sold not through a democratic process.
[00:55:32.452 --> 00:55:40.754]  That would take too long and devour far too much of the funds to educate the cannon fodder, unfortunately, which populates the Earth.
[00:55:40.754 --> 00:55:42.555]  We have to take almost an elitist program
[00:55:43.368 --> 00:55:59.881]  That we can see beyond our swollen bellies and look to the future, in time frames and in results, which are not easily understood or which can be, with intellectual honesty, be reduced down to some kind of simplistic definition.
[00:55:59.881 --> 00:56:02.903]  That's an amazing statement, George Hunt.
[00:56:02.903 --> 00:56:05.045]  Yes, it's amazing, alright.
[00:56:05.045 --> 00:56:06.326]  It turned my gut and
[00:56:07.968 --> 00:56:11.111]  Uh, that's why I'm talking to you today, Alex.
[00:56:11.111 --> 00:56:13.052]  It just offended me so much.
[00:56:13.052 --> 00:56:25.863]  We're the cannon fodder that are unfortunately on the earth and they're talking about billions of dollars they already had in their banking system and how, and talking about our property as if it was already theirs and how they were going to get it.
[00:56:25.863 --> 00:56:26.963]  Yes, sir.
[00:56:26.963 --> 00:56:35.150]  And they're, they're, uh, eliminating population, uh, all the time through AIDS through, uh,
[00:56:35.863 --> 00:56:36.583]  I don't
[00:56:59.117 --> 00:57:15.534]  We have to get Cheney up to the Justice Bar and find out why Halliburton hired these Blackguard people that are killing citizens.
[00:57:15.534 --> 00:57:17.195]  It's all over.
[00:57:17.195 --> 00:57:19.838]  It's all through our society.
[00:57:19.838 --> 00:57:21.660]  We can't stop our government either.
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:22.881]  They just keep on killing.
[00:57:25.706 --> 00:57:32.670]  Well, we do have State Department memorandum 200, where in 73, secretly to the CIA, it was U.S.
[00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:40.294]  government policy to use IMF and World Bank loans to force third-world populations to reduce their population by at least 50%.
[00:57:40.294 --> 00:57:43.816]  Yes, that kind of stuff.
[00:57:43.816 --> 00:57:46.538]  That goes on all the time, I guess.
[00:57:47.782 --> 00:57:48.242]  Amazing.
[00:57:48.242 --> 00:57:52.085]  There are so many other clips here to play of 19.
[00:57:52.085 --> 00:57:54.026]  What should we play next, George Hunt?
[00:57:54.026 --> 00:57:54.626]  Number 10.
[00:57:54.626 --> 00:57:56.447]  I think number 10 would be good.
[00:57:56.447 --> 00:57:59.549]  Okay, Rothschild elaborates.
[00:57:59.549 --> 00:58:00.150]  Well, you know what?
[00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:06.053]  We're going to go to break in a moment, come back in the next hour, and we'll play it when we come back after this 70-second break.
[00:58:06.053 --> 00:58:08.294]  And George Hunt will be with us for 30 minutes of the next hour.
[00:58:08.294 --> 00:58:09.795]  This is too important.
[00:58:09.795 --> 00:58:13.998]  We're going to continue playing these clips, and then specifically for George Hunt.
[00:58:14.853 --> 00:58:22.377]  Specifically and only for him on the subject of the phony environmental eugenics death plot movement.
[00:58:22.377 --> 00:58:25.239]  Calls to George Hunt will take four or five calls.
[00:58:25.239 --> 00:58:25.319]  1-800-259-9231.

[00:59:55.145 --> 00:59:57.847]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.412 --> 01:00:09.256]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[01:00:09.256 --> 01:00:10.837]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.837 --> 01:00:12.398]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.398 --> 01:00:16.581]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.581 --> 01:00:21.624]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.624 --> 01:00:24.967]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour when George Hunt leaves us,
[01:00:25.587 --> 01:00:27.788]  I'm going to get into the latest on health care.
[01:00:27.788 --> 01:00:37.230]  The flu scam has now been completely exposed by the EU itself as a total fraud and they admit these vaccines were dangerous and it was wrong.
[01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:46.532]  We're also going to get into the latest on Bankstergate with Timmy Geithner and all of his criminal activity and your phone calls but George Hunt inside Whistleblower
[01:00:47.245 --> 01:00:57.175]  Who by a twist of fate wanted to get his son a job in conservation and literally one of the heads of the global government conference was sick.
[01:00:57.175 --> 01:01:03.762]  He called him and he said probably didn't thought it was somebody else from the conference calling and said, yeah, you can go and just walk right into this.
[01:01:04.525 --> 01:01:07.988]  And that's why it's important you go to government and non-governmental events.
[01:01:07.988 --> 01:01:09.650]  Weasel your way in, record it.
[01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:14.274]  I mean, I went to a Smart Growth Conference in 1998 in Austin.
[01:01:14.274 --> 01:01:20.239]  They had 4,000 people there, mainly from counties and cities, paid by the cities to be there.
[01:01:20.239 --> 01:01:23.862]  And they had the heads of the banks going, we're taking everybody's property.
[01:01:23.862 --> 01:01:25.003]  They weren't denying it.
[01:01:25.003 --> 01:01:26.284]  It was a joke.
[01:01:26.284 --> 01:01:27.945]  They were admitting they were criminals.
[01:01:27.945 --> 01:01:29.547]  I mean, they didn't even deny it.
[01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:31.191]  Okay?
[01:01:31.191 --> 01:01:32.431]  And I was just, whoa!
[01:01:32.431 --> 01:01:34.292]  That's when I really woke up to the environmentalists.
[01:01:34.292 --> 01:01:37.514]  I mean, I already thought I knew they were just misguided communists.
[01:01:37.514 --> 01:01:37.875]  No, no, no.
[01:01:37.875 --> 01:01:39.255]  These are bankers.
[01:01:39.255 --> 01:01:43.438]  Okay, so this next clip is Rothschild elaborates.
[01:01:43.438 --> 01:01:46.420]  Then we'll go through more of these clips and get George Hunt's take on it.
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:48.061]  Okay, Rothschild elaborates.
[01:01:48.061 --> 01:01:49.462]  We'll play this.
[01:01:49.462 --> 01:01:56.646]  To overcome the chilling, doom-laden prognostications of Dr. Irving Mintzer's greenhouse effect,
[01:01:57.751 --> 01:02:16.267]  Perhaps it could be possible to utilize CO2, carbon dioxide, one of its main causes, to manufacture dry ice, to maintain the polar caps and the actual temperature of the ice there, and maintain their present temperature.
[01:02:16.267 --> 01:02:21.071]  Innovative and modern technology, world waste material,
[01:02:21.932 --> 01:02:36.639]  Collected and perhaps burnt in volcanic areas, or buried so deep in the earth, in the wilderness desert areas of the mid-Sahara, where nobody goes, or in the empty quarter in Arabia, or the Gobi Desert.
[01:02:36.639 --> 01:02:47.704]  But all these ideas and visions, some far-fetched, and above all, the continuation of this Congress, needs money.
[01:02:49.748 --> 01:02:58.914]  So they get to take over and ship dry ice, imagine the money they'd make, or they will control globally toxic waste being shipped to the Sahara.
[01:02:58.914 --> 01:03:12.563]  So they want to control waste management, they want to control private property, and they want to scare the public with far-fetched programs into accepting that the earth must be dying from carbon dioxide because look at all the money we're spending on it.
[01:03:12.563 --> 01:03:13.803]  It must be real.
[01:03:13.803 --> 01:03:17.886]  Is that an accurate breakdown of what he was really saying there, George Hunt?
[01:03:18.453 --> 01:03:26.077]  Yes, they're creating a demand for dry ice machines, shall we say, through their rhetoric.
[01:03:26.972 --> 01:03:53.765]  So that the people will become fearful of Mother Earth crumbling and they'll give in then to all of these monstrous projects that will cost trillions of dollars and the elite will be in the front end of these projects, maybe as the first investors, and it will grow into a huge monster and then it'll collapse.
[01:03:54.895 --> 01:04:03.105]  And the elite will have pulled themselves out of the of this project before it collapses.
[01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:11.174]  So you're going to see a lot of these ideas coming along that will change the climate.
[01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:14.722]  Harp is one example.
[01:04:14.722 --> 01:04:16.582]  That was another point and we're going to go to break.
[01:04:16.582 --> 01:04:19.083]  Long segment coming up and play clip after clip.
[01:04:19.083 --> 01:04:21.003]  But clearly it's now declassified.
[01:04:21.003 --> 01:04:21.924]  They have weather weapons.
[01:04:21.924 --> 01:04:24.244]  They can create, control hurricanes.
[01:04:24.244 --> 01:04:25.625]  That's all declassified.
[01:04:25.625 --> 01:04:34.487]  We know the White House science czar, John P. Holdren, who's called for global extermination, drugging the water to sterilizes in his own book, Ecoscience.
[01:04:35.237 --> 01:04:41.363]  We know that they're already manipulating the weather to create calamities to scare people into submission.
[01:04:41.363 --> 01:04:42.344]  George Hunt, stay there.
[01:04:42.344 --> 01:04:47.209]  I'm going to come back and get your take on that on the other side of this quick break.
[01:04:47.209 --> 01:04:54.157]  And then we're going to play clip after clip and get quick comments from you about what Rothschild, Strong, and others are saying.
[01:04:54.927 --> 01:04:57.890]  They talk about international communism being introduced?
[01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:59.752]  This is incredible info!
[01:04:59.752 --> 01:05:04.296]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.296 --> 01:05:05.217]  Number one.
[01:05:05.217 --> 01:05:08.640]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.501]  Number two.
[01:05:09.501 --> 01:05:14.385]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:14.385 --> 01:05:15.146]  It's true.
[01:05:15.146 --> 01:05:20.010]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.010 --> 01:05:20.531]  Number three.
[01:05:20.811 --> 01:05:24.394]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.394 --> 01:05:29.117]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.117 --> 01:05:31.879]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:31.879 --> 01:05:36.342]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.342 --> 01:05:40.485]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:40.485 --> 01:05:45.249]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:45.529 --> 01:05:49.712]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:51.494]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:51.494 --> 01:05:53.756]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:05:53.756 --> 01:05:56.097]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:01.377 --> 01:06:05.338]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:05.338 --> 01:06:14.199]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:14.199 --> 01:06:18.820]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:29.642]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:30.282 --> 01:06:39.785]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:39.785 --> 01:06:45.227]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:45.227 --> 01:06:52.710]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:55.451]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:07:00.635 --> 01:07:04.657]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:04.657 --> 01:07:07.899]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:12.681]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:12.681 --> 01:07:19.105]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:19.105 --> 01:07:21.326]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:21.866 --> 01:07:23.346]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:07:23.346 --> 01:07:24.627]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:24.627 --> 01:07:26.867]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:40.771 --> 01:07:48.059]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:07:48.059 --> 01:07:57.169]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:08:05.231 --> 01:08:10.074]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.074 --> 01:08:11.655]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:13.215]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.215 --> 01:08:17.398]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.398 --> 01:08:22.561]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.561 --> 01:08:30.245]  Eight minutes into hour number three, George Hunt was just talking about how they declassified weather manipulation, weather control systems.
[01:08:31.411 --> 01:08:36.954]  Now, they can clearly use this to create calamities and then scare the population into submission.
[01:08:36.954 --> 01:08:39.796]  That's been one of my biggest concerns.
[01:08:39.796 --> 01:08:43.098]  Going back to George Hunt, George, your take on that?
[01:08:43.098 --> 01:08:52.524]  Well, um, the, um, the concern that I have is the E-bomb.
[01:08:52.524 --> 01:08:57.727]  The, uh, so-called, uh, surge bomb?
[01:08:57.727 --> 01:08:59.388]  Electromagnetic pulse weapon.
[01:09:00.385 --> 01:09:02.307]  Yes, you got it.
[01:09:02.307 --> 01:09:21.283]  That thing would be easy for any little state like North Korea or Iran or Israel to send a rocket bearing an atomic bomb up in the sky about 300 miles, exploding it and wiping out all of the electricity in line of sight of that explosion.
[01:09:21.283 --> 01:09:22.524]  That's the thing that bothers me.
[01:09:22.524 --> 01:09:24.966]  You think the globalists would go that far?
[01:09:24.966 --> 01:09:26.307]  Oh yes.
[01:09:26.307 --> 01:09:29.530]  David Rockefeller has stated, and I checked it on the
[01:09:30.177 --> 01:09:38.804]  On the internet last night, that the world order will not be established until a terrible catastrophe occurs.
[01:09:38.804 --> 01:09:40.445]  Yeah, they all say that continually.
[01:09:40.445 --> 01:09:45.229]  He actually said that in the Council on Foreign Relations publication, Foreign Affairs.
[01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:48.151]  That's part of their fear doctrine, huh?
[01:09:48.151 --> 01:09:49.032]  Maybe.
[01:09:49.032 --> 01:09:51.975]  Do you want to continue along that line or go to some more clips?
[01:09:51.975 --> 01:09:54.076]  Well, I'd like to follow the line.
[01:09:54.076 --> 01:09:55.117]  Let's go to some clips.
[01:09:55.117 --> 01:09:58.280]  Let's have Maury Strong on number 7.
[01:10:00.093 --> 01:10:03.354]  Okay, Maury Strong announces Rothschild.
[01:10:03.354 --> 01:10:06.035]  Then I want to get to Rothschild talking about communism.
[01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:09.236]  Okay, here's Maury Strong.
[01:10:09.236 --> 01:10:10.356]  Let's play seven first.
[01:10:10.356 --> 01:10:11.016]  Let's go through these.
[01:10:11.016 --> 01:10:12.237]  Here's seven.
[01:10:12.237 --> 01:10:14.417]  There is no better person.
[01:10:14.417 --> 01:10:24.340]  He epitomizes in his own life that positive synthesis between environment conservation on the one hand and economics on the other.
[01:10:25.091 --> 01:10:32.618]  And I'm just delighted to have this opportunity of introducing to you, Edmund D. Rothschild.
[01:10:32.618 --> 01:10:37.762]  Now, I want to go ahead now and go to clip number 13.
[01:10:37.762 --> 01:10:41.365]  I want to play the World Collective again, then some new clips, 14 and others.
[01:10:41.365 --> 01:10:43.767]  Here's 13 with Rothschild.
[01:10:43.767 --> 01:10:52.755]  By thinking forward as to how to reach out to the public at large, to every corporate entity throughout the world, to put aside
[01:10:53.621 --> 01:11:03.584]  Hopefully, tax-free, a part of their profits to fund our ecological and environmental protection.
[01:11:03.584 --> 01:11:13.728]  So, tax-free paid to his bank, I have Reuters right here, 20-something years later, here it is happening, giving them money and then they're tax-free to use it.
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:15.501]  That's it.
[01:11:15.501 --> 01:11:25.089]  I didn't know that occurred, but I saw the banks tumbling down, and as the banks tumble, they're tumbling to the house of Rothschild.
[01:11:25.089 --> 01:11:40.141]  Now, on the last clip you played, or the one before that, did you hear Maurice Strong announce him as the positive synthesis between conservation on one side and growth and development on the other?
[01:11:40.141 --> 01:11:43.224]  He is the result of
[01:11:43.942 --> 01:11:49.835]  He controls, in other words, the conservation movement and the economic movement.
[01:11:49.835 --> 01:11:51.418]  Rothschild's got it all.
[01:11:51.418 --> 01:11:53.884]  Well, I've seen all the big Rothschilds out of England.
[01:11:55.504 --> 01:12:00.645]  The two heads of it, openly writing articles, giving speeches, calling for global governance.
[01:12:00.645 --> 01:12:04.326]  We'll play a clip from Bloomberg during Copenhagen coming up.
[01:12:04.326 --> 01:12:07.467]  Let's go ahead now and go to clip number 14.
[01:12:07.467 --> 01:12:11.608]  Rothschild, Lord Rothschild, international communism introduced.
[01:12:11.608 --> 01:12:12.828]  Here's that clip.
[01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:17.909]  Ladies and gentlemen, every country has its own problems.
[01:12:17.909 --> 01:12:22.210]  Its indigenous peoples and its wildlife.
[01:12:22.210 --> 01:12:24.331]  This International Conservation Bank
[01:12:25.197 --> 01:12:29.539]  ...must know no frontiers, no boundaries.
[01:12:29.539 --> 01:12:41.225]  Its funds must be used constructively and not, and not to be challenged into greedy hands or weapons of destruction.
[01:12:41.225 --> 01:12:49.129]  So here are these people always financing revolutions and wars and weapon systems, and you call that communism introduced.
[01:12:49.129 --> 01:12:49.809]  Why do you say that?
[01:12:50.663 --> 01:13:02.209]  Yes, in other words, the currency will be used as a communal device, because there will be one world currency.
[01:13:02.209 --> 01:13:19.937]  And he's saying, too, as I recall in speech, that each country also has its own indigenous people, and they'll be allowed to have soft currencies, but the currencies will be intermingled
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:26.045]  Yeah, you're going to have a global currency over the regionals, which they're now setting up.
[01:13:26.045 --> 01:13:31.330]  It's amazing, 23 years later, to see all of this actually unfolding.
[01:13:31.330 --> 01:13:43.841]  And also, Ban Ki-moon, a month and a half ago in the New York Times, Secretary General of the UN, he said all nations will be forced to pay into the UN to fund this.
[01:13:43.841 --> 01:13:45.462]  Let's play clip number 15.
[01:13:45.462 --> 01:13:46.683]  Rothschild brags.
[01:13:46.683 --> 01:13:47.044]  Here it is.
[01:13:51.579 --> 01:14:04.208]  If there are any Japanese in the audience, I would apologize to them, but I've had very great experience in Japan since my family has had connections with them since 1865 after Perry opened them up in 1863.
[01:14:10.649 --> 01:14:12.710]  Let's play another clip.
[01:14:12.710 --> 01:14:16.111]  Let's have Michael Sweetman, James Baker quote.
[01:14:16.111 --> 01:14:17.351]  Clip number 16.
[01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:20.232]  Here's Michael Sweetman, James Baker quote.
[01:14:20.232 --> 01:14:21.132]  Here it is.
[01:14:21.132 --> 01:14:23.153]  At his keynote address to this Congress, U.S.
[01:14:23.153 --> 01:14:32.015]  Treasury Secretary James A. Baker pointed to the, I quote, the underlying reality that sound conservation is good economics.
[01:14:32.015 --> 01:14:36.217]  And further, conservation should not be the enemy of prosperity.
[01:14:36.217 --> 01:14:40.098]  It should instead sustain and enrich our prosperity.
[01:14:40.098 --> 01:14:40.458]  Unquote.
[01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:47.653]  How do you decipher that, decode that, George Hunt?
[01:14:47.653 --> 01:14:52.356]  I couldn't hear him very well on that.
[01:14:52.356 --> 01:14:53.076]  I have to beg...
[01:14:55.817 --> 01:14:58.878]  Yeah, I think that's part of the problem today, as you're having trouble hearing.
[01:14:58.878 --> 01:15:02.399]  That was the James Baker quote by Michael Sweetman?
[01:15:02.399 --> 01:15:14.301]  Yes, I set that up for you to play because James Baker made a remark that caused the conservationists to tremble at the beginning of the meeting.
[01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:20.463]  He gave the keynote address, and he said that conservation required growth and development.
[01:15:21.633 --> 01:15:23.814]  And the conservationist said, what?
[01:15:23.814 --> 01:15:25.954]  You could hear the murmur in the audience.
[01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:37.958]  Well, what that means is that Rothschild, in order to be the positive synthesis of growth and development and economics, has to have a dynamic going.
[01:15:37.958 --> 01:15:48.281]  It has to be a forceful opposition in order for his group to go in and pick up the pieces and take over control.
[01:15:49.053 --> 01:15:59.943]  So he's encouraging this war between conservation and development and he is the synthesis of all the stuff that'll come out of the war.
[01:15:59.943 --> 01:16:10.632]  Now for those that missed it, I want to play banker David Lang talking about their elitist program and how to deal with the cannon fodder one more time and then two final clips we haven't played yet.
[01:16:10.632 --> 01:16:12.333]  Play clip 17.
[01:16:12.333 --> 01:16:13.615]  It's so chilling.
[01:16:13.615 --> 01:16:15.076]  Here is clip 17.
[01:16:15.076 --> 01:16:16.137]  David Lang from Montreal.
[01:16:17.552 --> 01:16:20.474]  He's always full of, he's always full of awkward questions, this chap.
[01:16:20.474 --> 01:16:26.497]  Until recently, on the balance sheet, there were billions of dollars still listed as existing, which have now been written off.
[01:16:26.497 --> 01:16:33.442]  And so those surpluses have a bad habit of disappearing when the auditor finally gets his hands into the balance sheet.
[01:16:33.442 --> 01:16:37.784]  I suggest, therefore, that this be sold not through a democratic process.
[01:16:37.784 --> 01:16:45.289]  That would take too long and devour far too much of the funds to educate the cannon fodder, unfortunately, which populates the Earth.
[01:16:46.081 --> 01:17:04.687]  We have to take almost an elitist program that we can see beyond our swollen bellies and look to the future in time frames and in results which are not easily understood or which can be, with intellectual honesty, be reduced down to some kind of simplistic definition.
[01:17:04.687 --> 01:17:06.528]  Okay, George Hunt.
[01:17:06.528 --> 01:17:12.230]  George, I want to ask you about this Maharaja clip where he questions Michael Sweetman's words.
[01:17:12.230 --> 01:17:15.451]  We're going to play this clip and then get you to comment on that, okay?
[01:17:17.285 --> 01:17:17.946]  All right, good.
[01:17:17.946 --> 01:17:21.608]  Here's the Maharaja questions Michael Sweetman's words.
[01:17:21.608 --> 01:17:22.729]  Here it is.
[01:17:22.729 --> 01:17:25.011]  I'll be very brief.
[01:17:25.011 --> 01:17:34.799]  I've been listening patiently to Michael Sweetman's paper and the discussion so far.
[01:17:34.799 --> 01:17:37.621]  I'm confused.
[01:17:37.621 --> 01:17:42.965]  Particularly since I am the president of the World Wildlife Fund India, an NGO.
[01:17:44.714 --> 01:17:51.537]  of the need of another helping hand.
[01:17:51.537 --> 01:18:11.486]  But since this baby has been accidentally conceived by Michael Swetman and I presume that he's either a very foolish man or a very clever man.
[01:18:11.486 --> 01:18:12.727]  I think he's a very clever man.
[01:18:13.883 --> 01:18:16.505]  Because the paper does not give any details.
[01:18:16.505 --> 01:18:19.546]  It's very general.
[01:18:19.546 --> 01:18:33.775]  Wow, so Maharaja's pointing out this gives a blank check of power to this World Conference Congress instead of the World Wildlife Fund set up by the Nazi Prince Bernhard to carry out extermination.
[01:18:33.775 --> 01:18:36.877]  What's going on in that clip with the Maharaja?
[01:18:36.877 --> 01:18:41.940]  Well, the Maharaja saw the light.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:43.421]  He saw that
[01:18:44.122 --> 01:18:56.189]  Either it was a very foolish plan that Michael Sweetman was introducing, you know, to save the world's conservation, or it was a clever plan.
[01:18:56.189 --> 01:19:03.333]  And he didn't identify why it was clever, but he said, but I believe it's a clever plan.
[01:19:03.333 --> 01:19:11.137]  It's a clever plan because it seems to appear that they are saving conservation.
[01:19:12.202 --> 01:19:15.904]  And I think that's what the Maharajah saw.
[01:19:15.904 --> 01:19:22.266]  They were going to get money out of it instead of nice pretty new trees.
[01:19:22.266 --> 01:19:23.667]  It's a clever plan.
[01:19:23.667 --> 01:19:28.128]  And everyone laughs because they understand that of course it's a joke.
[01:19:28.128 --> 01:19:33.030]  That's why they're there is to get their hands on property and control the world population.
[01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:34.231]  So he's stating the obvious.
[01:19:36.076 --> 01:19:42.722]  I asked them as an official host, when is this bank going to come to pass?
[01:19:42.722 --> 01:19:54.673]  And what I got out of them was, there will be a collapse in 2012 of the world currency, and that the World Conservation Bank will come in to save the world.
[01:19:54.673 --> 01:19:57.316]  So to stay there, this is incredible bombshell info.
[01:19:57.316 --> 01:19:58.777]  Stay with us.
[01:19:58.777 --> 01:19:59.277]  Amazing.

[01:21:01.312 --> 01:21:05.333]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:05.333 --> 01:21:08.574]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:08.574 --> 01:21:13.376]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:13.376 --> 01:21:17.217]  Tremendous influence on our president and Congress.
[01:21:17.877 --> 01:21:19.739]  And they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:19.739 --> 01:21:24.963]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:24.963 --> 01:21:35.071]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:35.071 --> 01:21:37.413]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:37.413 --> 01:21:39.014]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:39.014 --> 01:21:41.476]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:41.476 --> 01:21:43.597]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:43.597 --> 01:21:46.340]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[01:21:47.081 --> 01:21:48.724]  A Fall of the Republic.

[01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:01.641]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:01.641 --> 01:22:07.185]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:07.185 --> 01:22:07.725]  I get it.
[01:22:07.725 --> 01:22:17.353]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:17.353 --> 01:22:18.754]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:18.754 --> 01:22:23.117]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[01:22:23.337 --> 01:22:25.178]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value?
[01:22:25.178 --> 01:22:27.219]  Or that your retirement would be secure?
[01:22:27.219 --> 01:22:30.600]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:34.882]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:34.882 --> 01:22:36.482]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:36.482 --> 01:22:39.884]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:39.884 --> 01:22:44.246]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:44.246 --> 01:22:45.166]  You should too.
[01:22:45.166 --> 01:22:46.306]  Find out what they know.
[01:22:46.306 --> 01:22:49.688]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:22:49.688 --> 01:22:49.728]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:52.449 --> 01:22:54.511]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:54.511 --> 01:23:01.557]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:01.557 --> 01:23:04.460]  Our economy is in great distress.
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:07.983]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:13.508]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[01:23:13.508 --> 01:23:16.191]  You have auto and home insurance.
[01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:18.233]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[01:23:19.369 --> 01:23:22.651]  Are you prepared to feed your family long-term?
[01:23:22.651 --> 01:23:25.313]  Because it might take years to recover.
[01:23:25.313 --> 01:23:31.857]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[01:23:31.857 --> 01:23:39.202]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.
[01:23:39.202 --> 01:23:46.147]  50 heirloom varieties, 8,000 vegetable seeds, over 5 pounds of healthy food,
[01:23:47.285 --> 01:23:51.748]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[01:23:51.748 --> 01:24:00.152]  Survivalistseeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[01:24:00.152 --> 01:24:02.054]  Is it getting better?
[01:24:16.474 --> 01:24:21.820]  Or do you feel the same?
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:23.442]  Will it make it easier on you?
[01:24:23.442 --> 01:24:31.130]  Alright, I'm gonna go ahead and just keep George Hunt till 40 after so I can go to Mike Herman, Terry Bin and a couple others.
[01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:33.632]  But he just dropped another big bombshell.
[01:24:33.632 --> 01:24:36.936]  Studying the UN Zone documents, studying the IMF World Bank,
[01:24:37.603 --> 01:24:45.005]  The banks want to get everybody in debt, all the nations, all the sub-states within the nations bankrupted to then make you dependent on them.
[01:24:45.005 --> 01:24:52.467]  And then under environmental rules, grab and snatch property and raise the taxes so you go bankrupt.
[01:24:52.467 --> 01:24:57.509]  Then they bring in a global regime, global rationing openly being announced.
[01:24:57.509 --> 01:24:58.449]  This is their plan.
[01:24:59.102 --> 01:25:00.864]  They're brainwashing your kids in school.
[01:25:00.864 --> 01:25:02.365]  They're really trying it.
[01:25:02.365 --> 01:25:04.708]  Copenhagen was a big blow against them.
[01:25:04.708 --> 01:25:07.250]  The fact that their scientists know it's a fraud.
[01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:09.032]  Ben Santer at the U.N.
[01:25:09.032 --> 01:25:11.295]  admitting that it's all, you know, made up.
[01:25:11.295 --> 01:25:14.138]  That they basically cut these sections out of the U.N.
[01:25:14.138 --> 01:25:18.142]  report where their own scientists said man wasn't causing global warming.
[01:25:18.782 --> 01:25:23.547]  Or they're covering up the fact for the last nine years the earth has been radically cooling.
[01:25:23.547 --> 01:25:25.269]  All of this.
[01:25:25.269 --> 01:25:32.697]  And then he's saying he's there talking to Rockefeller, talking to others, specifically tell that story.
[01:25:35.097 --> 01:25:35.217]  Okay.
[01:25:35.217 --> 01:25:35.837]  It was a
[01:26:00.774 --> 01:26:06.518]  You remember I was there for three days asking lots of questions, okay?
[01:26:06.518 --> 01:26:17.406]  So, the questions evolved to, number one, the question I had was, how is this bank going to be funded?
[01:26:17.406 --> 01:26:30.235]  I learned through the guests there, maybe I went to McNeil of the United Nations, I don't know where, but I found out that the plan is, and this is hearsay,
[01:26:31.741 --> 01:27:01.219]  That the plan is that the bank is going to bankrupt in 2012, and that the elite that put money into the bank, when it bankrupts, those elite people will go into the bank, take it over, and take over every mortgage, everything, all the accounts, all the credit cards, everything that people have, and the bank will then
[01:27:01.957 --> 01:27:10.651]  Officially be in Rothschild's hands where before it was surreptitiously in Rothschild's hands.
[01:27:11.021 --> 01:27:11.922]  Well, this is incredible.
[01:27:11.922 --> 01:27:12.522]  Let me stop you.
[01:27:12.522 --> 01:27:20.688]  I want you to elaborate, George Hunt, because now we see a small group of central banks bankrupting other banks by design to consolidate.
[01:27:20.688 --> 01:27:21.709]  That's in their own documents.
[01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:32.737]  We see the IMF and World Bank to be holding companies for the global tax money through what they did agree to at Copenhagen, and that's actually what they're now setting up.
[01:27:32.737 --> 01:27:37.601]  They're openly setting up what participants told you they were going to set up.
[01:27:37.601 --> 01:27:39.282]  Are they getting this position for 2012?
[01:27:41.075 --> 01:27:46.279]  That's where they're headed from my last information, Alex.
[01:27:46.279 --> 01:27:48.601]  They don't slow down on their plans.
[01:27:48.601 --> 01:27:50.162]  They don't defer them.
[01:27:50.162 --> 01:27:54.986]  They just eliminate the problem for their plans to go through.
[01:27:54.986 --> 01:27:58.049]  People like me, of course.
[01:27:58.049 --> 01:28:05.915]  So, yeah, I would say there's going to be a major currency splash in 2012.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.501]  Or leading up to 2000.
[01:28:10.501 --> 01:28:11.961]  Or leading up to 2012.
[01:28:11.961 --> 01:28:14.542]  I mean, this is already happening.
[01:28:14.542 --> 01:28:25.306]  The globe is imploding by an engineered depression, and everything is falling to the house of Rothschild and Rockefeller, and every time they bust an oligarch in Russia, it turns out it was really owned by the Rothschilds.
[01:28:25.306 --> 01:28:26.947]  That's mainstream news.
[01:28:26.947 --> 01:28:27.847]  Well, yeah.
[01:28:27.847 --> 01:28:30.288]  Look at the news about Warren Buffett.
[01:28:30.288 --> 01:28:35.110]  He's accusing the Rothschild family of controlling the world gold market.
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:41.942]  He's probably right, because the Rothschilds set the price of gold twice a day in London.
[01:28:41.942 --> 01:28:44.562]  For the world.
[01:28:44.562 --> 01:28:46.423]  Unbelievable information.
[01:28:46.423 --> 01:28:53.665]  And again, when did you first start going public, releasing the videos of the conferences, releasing the audio, and saying all of this?
[01:28:53.665 --> 01:28:56.405]  Wasn't it like 20 years ago?
[01:28:56.405 --> 01:28:57.266]  Yes.
[01:28:57.266 --> 01:29:02.667]  It was in 1988 that a preacher named Charles O'Allendale
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:20.689]  Who had a radio station in Texas, was accused of having me on, and they said, look, if you have that guy George Hunt on again, you're going to lose your job.
[01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:24.351]  Well, he had me on again the next week, because this is Earth Shattering News.
[01:29:25.009 --> 01:29:30.190]  Well, the station was immediately bought out, and Alan Dale lost his job.
[01:29:30.190 --> 01:29:32.090]  And that's the issue.
[01:29:32.090 --> 01:29:35.911]  20 years ago, 22 years ago, they could stop stuff.
[01:29:35.911 --> 01:29:37.131]  Now they can't.
[01:29:37.131 --> 01:29:38.171]  It's out in the open.
[01:29:38.171 --> 01:29:38.711]  Stay there.
[01:29:38.711 --> 01:29:41.092]  George Hunt, incredible information.
[01:29:41.092 --> 01:29:43.912]  The website is The, with a The in the front.

[01:29:51.974 --> 01:29:53.494]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.472 --> 01:30:00.075]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.075 --> 01:30:05.398]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:30:05.398 --> 01:30:08.160]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:13.503]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:30:13.503 --> 01:30:17.985]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[01:31:00.592 --> 01:31:03.595]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:03.595 --> 01:31:08.940]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:10.982]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:10.982 --> 01:31:15.987]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:15.987 --> 01:31:16.908]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.148 --> 01:31:18.289]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.289 --> 01:31:20.170]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.170 --> 01:31:21.230]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.230 --> 01:31:23.431]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.431 --> 01:31:24.772]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:24.772 --> 01:31:26.313]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.313 --> 01:31:31.575]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:31.575 --> 01:31:35.157]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.157 --> 01:31:38.639]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:38.979 --> 01:31:40.200]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.102]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.102 --> 01:31:42.223]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.223 --> 01:31:42.944]  All you can get.
[01:31:42.944 --> 01:31:44.245]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.245 --> 01:31:47.289]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:31:59.997 --> 01:32:01.157]  What's your home worth?
[01:32:01.157 --> 01:32:03.258]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:32:03.258 --> 01:32:06.299]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:32:06.299 --> 01:32:14.021]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[01:33:04.348 --> 01:33:07.649]  Way up north to Alaska.
[01:33:07.649 --> 01:33:10.009]  North to Alaska.
[01:33:10.009 --> 01:33:12.030]  Go north to rush your soul.
[01:33:15.396 --> 01:33:26.504]  Okay, final segment with George Hunt, and then I'm going to break down all the huge BankerGate news, what's happening with healthcare.
[01:33:26.504 --> 01:33:27.965]  It can be stopped.
[01:33:27.965 --> 01:33:30.467]  It looks like it's in conference right now.
[01:33:30.467 --> 01:33:34.050]  The flu fraud being fully exposed, but I want to go to calls.
[01:33:34.050 --> 01:33:35.291]  Mike Herman, Terry Benn.
[01:33:35.951 --> 01:33:48.600]  We're only taking calls specifically for George Hunt for your questions on this important issue of a global elite organizing the planet under the fraud of fake environmentalism to take your basic rights, your liberty, your property.
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:57.747]  And we played that clip yesterday of Australia where they're just grabbing all the farmer's land, literally in some areas all of it, and just saying it's off limits for carbon credits.
[01:33:57.747 --> 01:34:00.889]  You can't run cattle or sheep on your own land anymore.
[01:34:01.548 --> 01:34:07.052]  This is really happening, and it's happening here, and we've got to stop these people.
[01:34:07.052 --> 01:34:18.842]  When we got the SPP documents a few years ago from the North American Union meetings, it was the corporate leaders there running the government meetings with the bureaucracy saying, we're going to tax and pay ourselves the carbon tax.
[01:34:18.842 --> 01:34:20.423]  The good news is, this is in trouble.
[01:34:21.661 --> 01:34:25.242]  George Hunt, are you not excited to see Copenhagen exposed?
[01:34:25.242 --> 01:34:31.664]  And you were talking about this 22 years ago, and people, some of them were laughing at you, now it's all out in the open.
[01:34:31.664 --> 01:34:33.845]  Is that exciting you, George Hunt?
[01:34:33.845 --> 01:34:36.085]  Oh, it's exciting me so much.
[01:34:36.085 --> 01:34:40.307]  My name is George Washington Hunt, and I was born on Columbus Day.
[01:34:40.307 --> 01:34:48.749]  And I think that I have a mission to, uh, to defeat these people, to help defeat these people.
[01:34:48.749 --> 01:34:50.790]  I had, uh, when I was on the, uh,
[01:34:51.266 --> 01:34:57.487]  Jesse Ventura Show, I said to the camera, I think they're gonna win it.
[01:34:57.487 --> 01:35:00.388]  And the reason was that they're smarter than us.
[01:35:00.388 --> 01:35:12.290]  But if you take our combined intelligence, like I'm hearing coming out of you, and you're hearing coming out of me, we can whip these guys so we can get Americans to cooperate.
[01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:17.191]  Americans and others around the world just have to face their own documents, their own statements.
[01:35:17.191 --> 01:35:19.151]  I mean, in fact, I'll grab it, it's over here.
[01:35:21.777 --> 01:35:25.047]  I talk about this book every week on air, Ecoscience.
[01:35:25.047 --> 01:35:26.813]  I've scanned through the whole 1,100 pages.
[01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:30.612]  Or whatever it is, let me see how long it is.
[01:35:30.612 --> 01:35:32.513]  Yeah, the 1,100 pages.
[01:35:32.513 --> 01:35:39.338]  I've scanned through this and it openly says, poison the water supply, sterilize us, cut off our resources, bankrupt us.
[01:35:39.338 --> 01:35:43.120]  This is the White House science czar, John P. Holdren, wrote Ecoscience.
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:49.905]  I mean, there are literally thousands of white papers, books, publications, where they openly state what they're openly doing.
[01:35:49.905 --> 01:35:57.030]  And now this guy gives press conferences, the White House science czar, saying they've got a secret program already manipulating the weather.
[01:35:58.214 --> 01:35:58.995]  That's right.
[01:35:58.995 --> 01:36:12.116]  They dreamed up these plans as far as hundreds of years ago, and the contemporary plans that we see where the banks are going down and so on is
[01:36:13.629 --> 01:36:19.933]  It's part of their plan that was conceived, as far as I can see, a hundred years ago.
[01:36:19.933 --> 01:36:29.059]  Okay, I want to go to calls, but first I want to play a few global governance clips for people that may have missed the last few of them, that have occurred in the last two months.
[01:36:29.059 --> 01:36:37.664]  Herman Van Rompuy, the head of the EU, openly calling for global governance, saying that the UN global carbon tax is the heart of world government.
[01:36:38.344 --> 01:36:41.507]  The head of the EU, we have Gordon Brown calling for global governance.
[01:36:41.507 --> 01:36:47.733]  We have David Rothschild, the heir to this whole criminal fortune, calling for it.
[01:36:47.733 --> 01:36:51.517]  Here is David Rothschild from Copenhagen on Bloomberg TV.
[01:36:52.978 --> 01:36:54.038]  In case you missed it,
[01:37:21.932 --> 01:37:24.493]  It's past the point of talking.
[01:37:24.493 --> 01:37:32.057]  We know historically that the global governance sort of agenda to these issues is very hard to try.
[01:37:32.057 --> 01:37:35.359]  So there he is saying the time for talk is over.
[01:37:35.359 --> 01:37:37.380]  That means you don't get any input.
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:38.120]  We're doing this.
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:39.681]  Well, we did get input.
[01:37:39.681 --> 01:37:41.482]  We did expose their fraud.
[01:37:41.482 --> 01:37:42.383]  They're in trouble.
[01:37:42.383 --> 01:37:42.903]  George Hunt.
[01:37:44.153 --> 01:37:53.040]  This whole global carbon tax thing that's going on, I have to admit that I don't really understand it.
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:38:06.191]  But I do know that the House of Rothschild pushed it through the chairman of the House of Rothschild at a meeting of the London banks.
[01:38:06.191 --> 01:38:11.015]  That happened about six months ago when I picked up on that clip.
[01:38:11.741 --> 01:38:17.205]  This carbon tax, what do you know about it, Alex?
[01:38:17.205 --> 01:38:25.252]  Well, it's fully meant to tax and control all human activity to be selectively enforced, just like the health care plan.
[01:38:25.252 --> 01:38:29.255]  Some unions don't have to do it, but the rest of the public do.
[01:38:29.255 --> 01:38:35.280]  It's all selectively enforced, like Obama decided what car dealerships stayed open, what didn't.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:39.103]  $3 billion of the $25 billion for the auto bailout paid to move
[01:38:39.853 --> 01:38:46.075]  Factories on record, this is Associated Press, to Brazil, Eastern Europe, Russia, and China.
[01:38:46.075 --> 01:38:51.737]  So the globalists literally pay to have factories built for themselves.
[01:38:51.737 --> 01:39:02.981]  As Maury Strong said on TV in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro as the head of the UN Summit, it is our job to destroy industrial society in the West.
[01:39:02.981 --> 01:39:04.962]  Let's play this clip of Herman Van Rompuy
[01:39:06.263 --> 01:39:11.006]  In his acceptance speech is the new head of the EU calling for global governance.
[01:39:11.006 --> 01:39:18.772]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of the financial crisis.
[01:39:18.772 --> 01:39:27.498]  The climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet.
[01:39:27.498 --> 01:39:32.862]  Our mission, our presidency, is one of hope, supported by acts
[01:39:34.417 --> 01:39:40.560]  Oh yes, they're getting us ready for global government, even in the schools, intermediate schools, colleges.
[01:40:02.846 --> 01:40:09.048]  People are all whistling global government.
[01:40:09.048 --> 01:40:11.449]  It has infected our society already.
[01:40:11.449 --> 01:40:28.314]  They'll attract the people through the religious aspects of the government, through the promise of being able to buy or sell if you cooperate with the global government.
[01:40:28.314 --> 01:40:31.015]  If you don't cooperate, you won't be able to buy or sell.
[01:40:31.863 --> 01:40:34.565]  That's been prophesied in the Bible.
[01:40:34.565 --> 01:40:38.949]  And I think that we're headed for that very soon when we have only one bank.
[01:40:40.626 --> 01:40:43.048]  And they're openly saying that's their program.
[01:40:43.048 --> 01:40:51.454]  This global private banking government will decide if you can have a business, if you can have a factory, if you can have a job, if you can have your farm, you own.
[01:40:51.454 --> 01:40:56.757]  I mean, this is really happening with the Animal ID, the Primus Society, all of it.
[01:40:56.757 --> 01:40:57.758]  That's why it's so... It's all happening.
[01:40:57.758 --> 01:40:58.679]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:58.679 --> 01:41:06.344]  In the Copenhagen 50, the Eco 50, whatever it was called, the Copenhagen, if we had
[01:41:07.558 --> 01:41:20.133]  If we had gone to the line and signed that document, we would have been giving away our rights to how much hot water we can use per day, what kind of car we'll drive.
[01:41:20.133 --> 01:41:26.401]  We would have made ourselves as the same common person in the world.
[01:41:26.952 --> 01:41:32.296]  And here we are, a blessed country, and we give it all up through Copenhagen 15.
[01:41:32.296 --> 01:41:35.879]  It's not enough for these bankers to rob and loot and run their scams.
[01:41:35.879 --> 01:41:39.622]  They want to shut off our resources to make us completely dependent on them.
[01:41:39.622 --> 01:41:41.344]  We're going to calls now.
[01:41:41.344 --> 01:41:44.606]  I want to encourage everybody to go to TheBigBadBank.com.
[01:41:44.606 --> 01:41:46.828]  TheBigBadBank.com.
[01:41:46.828 --> 01:41:48.950]  We have links to it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:51.312]  TheBigBadBank.com.
[01:41:51.312 --> 01:41:55.195]  And to get your video and book, both titled The Big Bad Bank,
[01:41:55.955 --> 01:41:59.156]  Also, while you're at it, folks, get, follow The Republic.
[01:41:59.156 --> 01:42:07.920]  It details who the bankers are, how they're imploding the economy by design, their own statements, their own documents, how they're using the environmental movement, the police state they're setting up to enforce it.
[01:42:08.772 --> 01:42:13.154]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement covers the depopulation, their entire program.
[01:42:13.154 --> 01:42:14.355]  Everyone must see this.
[01:42:14.355 --> 01:42:15.495]  This is real.
[01:42:15.495 --> 01:42:16.536]  They're doing it.
[01:42:16.536 --> 01:42:18.136]  You ask, what is the solution?
[01:42:18.136 --> 01:42:19.017]  Education.
[01:42:19.017 --> 01:42:23.459]  Show the people that environmentalism has nothing to do with the environment.
[01:42:23.459 --> 01:42:26.020]  They co-opt all these good people to serve them.
[01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:27.441]  This is their takeover.
[01:42:27.441 --> 01:42:32.563]  And it's in trouble, but they've invested hundreds of billions conservatively in this propaganda.
[01:42:32.563 --> 01:42:33.944]  They're moving forward with it.
[01:42:34.304 --> 01:42:35.104]  Yeah, a question for the guests.
[01:42:56.338 --> 01:43:08.664]  When you had met with the elite, had they mentioned anything about, this is in the late 80s from my understanding from what you're saying, anything about government sponsored terror, in particular 9-11 being carried out in the future?
[01:43:08.664 --> 01:43:12.226]  Staging crises, staging terror attacks.
[01:43:12.226 --> 01:43:21.490]  No, there was nothing mentioned of a war, or warfare, or anti-terrorism.
[01:43:21.490 --> 01:43:22.710]  Nothing like that came up.
[01:43:24.941 --> 01:43:31.386]  They talked about using the threat of environmental catastrophe, which is another form of false floor.
[01:43:31.386 --> 01:43:35.389]  Yeah, I missed that.
[01:43:35.389 --> 01:43:43.416]  Ross Charles said that we were doomed to extinction if we didn't accept its bank and its program.
[01:43:43.416 --> 01:43:44.577]  He will save us.
[01:43:44.577 --> 01:43:49.000]  And now his son, we're told in the newspaper, is a Jesus archetype, literally.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:49.541]  I mean, you can't
[01:43:50.094 --> 01:43:54.677]  You can't make this type of bizarreness up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:54.677 --> 01:43:57.679]  The hero gene inside talks about him being a Jesus figure.
[01:43:57.679 --> 01:43:58.539]  Anything else, Mike?
[01:43:58.539 --> 01:44:06.985]  Dallas, you think then that the right-wing arm of the New World Order like this might be the left-wing arm?
[01:44:06.985 --> 01:44:07.705]  Yes.
[01:44:07.705 --> 01:44:12.168]  That carries out government-sponsored terror?
[01:44:12.168 --> 01:44:13.629]  Yes.
[01:44:13.629 --> 01:44:16.631]  Both parties, both groups do it, but yes.
[01:44:16.631 --> 01:44:17.832]  The Club of Rome said in 91,
[01:44:19.255 --> 01:44:24.279]  That they will use, on the left, phony environmentalism, on the right, staged terror.
[01:44:24.279 --> 01:44:25.840]  We have those quotes.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:27.001]  They published them.
[01:44:27.001 --> 01:44:30.083]  We have them in articles that Paul Watson's written, with direct links.
[01:44:30.083 --> 01:44:33.045]  They said they will use that pincer to capture us.
[01:44:33.045 --> 01:44:35.707]  On the right, they'll use security and terror.
[01:44:35.707 --> 01:44:37.128]  On the left, the environment.
[01:44:37.128 --> 01:44:38.429]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[01:44:38.429 --> 01:44:42.212]  Comments on that, George Hunt?
[01:44:42.212 --> 01:44:47.616]  Oh, um, yes, uh, the, uh, Club of Rome is, is the, uh,
[01:44:49.046 --> 01:45:13.563]  The group that was brought up indirectly at the Congress because Gro Harlem Bruteland, the lady that accepted Ross Charles' banking program, she was there and she's the one that heads up the elimination of people on the planet.
[01:45:16.016 --> 01:45:24.083]  She's also the chairman, I think, of the United Nations UNED Committee.
[01:45:24.083 --> 01:45:26.545]  It's called the Brookland Committee.
[01:45:26.545 --> 01:45:31.429]  The UNED is the one that created UNCED.
[01:45:31.429 --> 01:45:33.151]  Isn't that a funny name?
[01:45:33.151 --> 01:45:34.131]  UNED.
[01:45:34.131 --> 01:45:41.397]  That's the United Nations Commission on Environment and Development, and that's the one that Rothschild was the...
[01:45:43.755 --> 01:45:48.624]  That Maury Strong was the Secretary General of.
[01:45:48.624 --> 01:45:50.007]  Alright, let's take another call.
[01:45:50.007 --> 01:45:53.633]  Herman in New York, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:45:53.633 --> 01:45:53.854]  Yes sir.
[01:45:56.966 --> 01:46:02.170]  Yeah, first thing I have a comment and I have a question and I'll take my answer off air.
[01:46:02.170 --> 01:46:19.602]  First comment is, I repost all your articles on my Facebook page, facebook.com slash one zero zero B-I-L-L-I-O-N and my question for Mr. Hunt is, what's the most important part of the eugenics movement that should be highlighted and exposed?
[01:46:19.602 --> 01:46:20.983]  Because when I just say eugenics,
[01:46:21.423 --> 01:46:26.847]  And I just speak of the issue, it's a bit much for the average person to comprehend and swallow.
[01:46:26.847 --> 01:46:27.707]  Well, they better learn!
[01:46:27.707 --> 01:46:34.932]  Herman's asking again, what is the most important part of their depopulation agenda?
[01:46:34.932 --> 01:46:46.480]  Well, the most important part is to eliminate the people who are destroying the environment.
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:49.402]  If you look at pictures from the Bruinland Report,
[01:46:50.728 --> 01:46:54.050]  That's still available, I believe, from the United Nations.
[01:46:54.050 --> 01:47:03.594]  If you look at the pictures, it shows pictures of indigenous people who it's better to die than to live.
[01:47:04.246 --> 01:47:09.210]  Yeah, they say, oh, their life isn't happy, oh, isn't suicide good, is it euthanasia?
[01:47:09.210 --> 01:47:13.113]  We see Newsweek, the case for killing Granny, all these articles.
[01:47:13.113 --> 01:47:16.435]  We're being sold that death is actually compassionate.
[01:47:16.435 --> 01:47:19.498]  Oh, don't help people, just kill them.
[01:47:19.498 --> 01:47:21.479]  Thank you, Herman, I appreciate the call.
[01:47:21.479 --> 01:47:22.560]  Terry in Ohio.
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:23.461]  Terry, you're on the air.
[01:47:23.461 --> 01:47:24.762]  Yes, Alex.
[01:47:25.447 --> 01:47:26.088]  Yes.
[01:47:26.088 --> 01:47:27.970]  Hey, I got a question.
[01:47:27.970 --> 01:47:29.953]  I'm the pastor, but here's my thing.
[01:47:29.953 --> 01:47:33.437]  You've been doing this, and he's talking about too, as far as this banking.
[01:47:33.437 --> 01:47:35.279]  They're bankers.
[01:47:35.279 --> 01:47:42.949]  Well, you've even asked, and you've asked for solutions and things like that, and people are all looking for solutions, and I think I've come up with one.
[01:47:42.949 --> 01:47:43.850]  And here it is.
[01:47:44.617 --> 01:48:02.022]  If everybody quit paying on their credit cards, because these bankers are going to bankrupt the banks anyway, they're going to take their money out of the banks, and I know this is going to have an effect, because 316,000 people have left California.
[01:48:02.022 --> 01:48:03.942]  And look at the effect it's having on that.
[01:48:03.942 --> 01:48:10.684]  If people in every state just up and just quit paying on their credit cards, just up and stop it,
[01:48:14.406 --> 01:48:19.210]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:48:19.210 --> 01:48:27.656]  I mean, I'll say this is a very complex issue, but yes, the banks would then just get a bailout to themselves of our tax money to pay it.
[01:48:27.656 --> 01:48:35.702]  But by people not, and I'm not saying do this, it's your decision, by not supporting the system before they're ready to crash it, that will screw them up.
[01:48:35.702 --> 01:48:37.423]  And that's why they want global government.
[01:48:37.423 --> 01:48:38.904]  They talk about tax avoidance.
[01:48:39.304 --> 01:48:45.826]  They said they want an 87% total tax rate worldwide so people don't run from their control.
[01:48:45.826 --> 01:48:46.846]  And that's why they hate it.
[01:48:46.846 --> 01:48:53.808]  People are leaving Massachusetts, New York, California to states where they can still have a little bit lower taxes and survive.
[01:48:53.808 --> 01:48:58.869]  That's why the globalists come in and finance higher taxes locally so you have nowhere to run.
[01:48:58.869 --> 01:49:03.210]  And this is a very key point you brought up that we need to debate more and discuss more.
[01:49:03.210 --> 01:49:05.651]  Let me get a comment from George Hunt on what you just discussed.
[01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:15.455]  Well, you know, I never thought of those ways that we could prevent these people from doing their dirty deeds.
[01:49:15.455 --> 01:49:19.018]  I think the credit card idea is a good one.
[01:49:19.018 --> 01:49:24.481]  But could you get all the people in the United States to do it together?
[01:49:24.481 --> 01:49:27.943]  Because if you're the only one that does that, you're going to lose.
[01:49:29.358 --> 01:49:43.431]  Well, also, again, they're putting their cashless thumbprint face scan buying and selling in so that if you're not in good graces with Homeland Security and the global security network they've set up in Interpol, you won't be allowed to buy and sell even if you have the cash.
[01:49:43.431 --> 01:49:44.913]  That's what the cashless society is.
[01:49:44.913 --> 01:49:49.437]  You'll still have cash, you've just got an ID to do it, and they've openly announced they want that.
[01:49:49.437 --> 01:49:51.419]  I mean, they are coming in to squeeze you.
[01:49:51.419 --> 01:49:52.540]  They want to bankrupt you.
[01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:53.401]  They want to control you.
[01:49:54.506 --> 01:50:10.897]  I think for people who can, get into communities or loosely knit organizations rurally that decide to defend each other, decide to get each other out of debt, and then you've just got to wait for the tanks to come down the street whenever that happens and still be politically involved to try to stop that from happening.
[01:50:10.897 --> 01:50:14.580]  You've got to prepare for the worst, but also fight to stop it.
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:18.403]  Again, everything's multifaceted.
[01:50:18.403 --> 01:50:27.452]  But, you see, you can't just hide out in the country and wait for them to come, but you've also got to have communities, get to know your neighbors, understand who the enemy is, and say, we're going to stick together.
[01:50:27.452 --> 01:50:35.821]  Everything the globalists do is about dividing us so we can't stick together, so they can individually come like wolves and rip our guts out.
[01:50:36.488 --> 01:50:38.850]  That's what they do overseas, too.
[01:50:38.850 --> 01:50:48.559]  They get the Shiites against the Hussites against the Jebusites, and they get these... They rile the countries up by getting the religions fighting against one another.
[01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:01.731]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.731 --> 01:51:07.336]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.336 --> 01:51:12.341]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.341 --> 01:51:17.926]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:17.926 --> 01:51:22.610]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.137 --> 01:51:30.259]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.259 --> 01:51:31.359]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.359 --> 01:51:38.061]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.061 --> 01:51:41.242]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:51:49.224 --> 01:51:52.270]  327-0365.
[01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:57.119]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.119 --> 01:51:59.504]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:53:08.126 --> 01:53:10.547]  Supports clean, clear arteries.
[01:53:10.547 --> 01:53:12.428]  Healthy blood pressure levels.
[01:53:12.428 --> 01:53:14.609]  Healthy circulation and blood flow.
[01:53:14.609 --> 01:53:16.790]  Regular heart rate and beat.
[01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:19.371]  What if you could avoid heart attacks?
[01:53:19.371 --> 01:53:22.732]  What if you could avoid emergency room visits?
[01:53:22.732 --> 01:53:25.253]  What if you could avoid surgery?
[01:53:25.253 --> 01:53:25.854]  How?
[01:53:25.854 --> 01:53:26.854]  With this.
[01:53:26.854 --> 01:53:29.355]  Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:29.355 --> 01:53:30.155]  100% organic.
[01:53:30.155 --> 01:53:31.476]  No negative side effects.
[01:53:31.616 --> 01:53:31.856]  I think so.
[01:54:03.123 --> 01:54:20.349]  The preacher man says it's the end of time And the Mississippi River, she's a gold drive The interest is up and the stock market's down And you're only getting mugged if you go downtown
[01:54:26.228 --> 01:54:30.090]  They don't like you being self-sufficient.
[01:54:30.090 --> 01:54:37.935]  They don't like it when you got a four-wheel drive, a shotgun, a rifle, you know how to run a trot line, know how to grow tomatoes and homemade wine.
[01:54:37.935 --> 01:54:39.756]  They want you under their control.
[01:54:45.146 --> 01:54:48.428]  Animal ID, Primitive Society is all you in.
[01:54:48.428 --> 01:54:50.310]  They're taking over your local communities.
[01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:53.372]  They're putting fake environmentalists in to run your life.
[01:54:53.372 --> 01:54:56.995]  He's the equivalent of Soviet commissars.
[01:54:56.995 --> 01:54:59.056]  You've got to stand up against him.
[01:54:59.056 --> 01:55:01.258]  Crank up Hank Williams Jr.
[01:55:01.258 --> 01:55:02.018]  I'm not done with him.
[01:55:02.018 --> 01:55:04.200]  I want people to hear this part.
[01:55:05.965 --> 01:55:11.248]  They don't like the country boys, whether you're black, white, old, young.
[01:55:11.248 --> 01:55:14.130]  They don't like the fact that you're self-sufficient.
[01:55:14.130 --> 01:55:18.793]  They don't like the fact that they can't make you run.
[01:55:18.793 --> 01:55:21.515]  That they can't starve you out.
[01:55:21.515 --> 01:55:23.936]  That they can't control your life.
[01:55:23.936 --> 01:55:31.060]  And this is the key to defeating them, is being self-sufficient and getting out of debt and getting our republic back.
[01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:31.981]  Here it is!
[01:55:45.697 --> 01:55:46.517]  Let's go to Carl in Texas.
[01:55:46.517 --> 01:55:47.198]  Carl, you're on the air.
[01:55:47.198 --> 01:55:47.438]  Go ahead.
[01:56:15.686 --> 01:56:17.787]  Hey Alex, how you doing, man?
[01:56:17.787 --> 01:56:18.107]  Good.
[01:56:18.107 --> 01:56:24.990]  Hey look, I had a question for you and for George, but I guess if George is gone, I can ask you this question.
[01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:25.930]  No, George isn't gone.
[01:56:25.930 --> 01:56:26.470]  George is here.
[01:56:26.470 --> 01:56:27.190]  Oh, good.
[01:56:27.190 --> 01:56:29.731]  Good, good, good.
[01:56:29.731 --> 01:56:32.513]  Actually, Alex, you've inspired me.
[01:56:32.513 --> 01:56:36.534]  We actually filed bankruptcy about a year and a half ago.
[01:56:36.534 --> 01:56:41.156]  Well, actually, we were starting the process and we made it all official, but during that time,
[01:56:42.014 --> 01:56:45.716]  I questioned the dollar, wanted to find out everything I could about the dollar.
[01:56:45.716 --> 01:56:56.341]  The bottom line is, we found out everything we needed to know, and I thought all the stuff that I was learning about that Orwellian Theory about 1984, I thought initially was a joke.
[01:56:56.341 --> 01:56:56.921]  And it's not.
[01:56:56.921 --> 01:56:58.082]  The stuff is real.
[01:56:58.082 --> 01:56:59.182]  I'm 43.
[01:56:59.182 --> 01:57:01.223]  I know it's very real.
[01:57:01.223 --> 01:57:07.126]  But you've actually inspired me to start another business that sells home security and personal protection products.
[01:57:07.924 --> 01:57:10.968]  But one question I had for you, because I'm a fighter.
[01:57:10.968 --> 01:57:11.749]  I'm like you.
[01:57:11.749 --> 01:57:13.251]  I'm a fighter.
[01:57:13.251 --> 01:57:14.213]  We don't have a lot of time.
[01:57:14.213 --> 01:57:15.314]  We got George on here with you.
[01:57:15.314 --> 01:57:16.195]  Go ahead.
[01:57:16.195 --> 01:57:21.122]  But you did mention in one of your other episodes, you said, hey, things become too unstable.
[01:57:21.122 --> 01:57:22.443]  I'd go to a third world country.
[01:57:22.964 --> 01:57:26.266]  But how welcomed would we be in another country?
[01:57:26.266 --> 01:57:27.126]  In what country?
[01:57:27.126 --> 01:57:29.248]  No, this is going to be a global depression.
[01:57:29.248 --> 01:57:31.049]  I've said there's nowhere to run.
[01:57:31.049 --> 01:57:43.356]  I've said if there was some free country I could go to, like my ancestors on the Mayflower, on my father and mother's side, on the Jones side, Captain Jones of the Mayflower, on my mother's side, two members of the Mayflower, I would do that.
[01:57:43.356 --> 01:57:44.837]  There's nowhere to go.
[01:57:44.837 --> 01:57:47.818]  We stand, we fight, we stop them here.
[01:57:47.818 --> 01:57:48.979]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:48.979 --> 01:57:50.260]  Good to hear from you, Carl.
[01:57:50.260 --> 01:57:51.601]  Comments on what he just said.
[01:57:53.962 --> 01:57:57.824]  Well, my wife's ancestor was on the Mayflower, too.
[01:57:57.824 --> 01:58:02.567]  They must have been shipmates.
[01:58:02.567 --> 01:58:03.588]  I don't know.
[01:58:03.588 --> 01:58:18.596]  I don't really know the question that came up, but since this... I just want to bring up again that Maury Strong, it looks like he's been rewarded with an $8 billion payoff.
[01:58:19.955 --> 01:58:38.420]  I'm going to launch an investigation into that, and I'd appreciate any help that your radio listeners could give me in fighting the fight out there by spreading the news, the unhappy news that we've been had.
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:41.921]  Hold on, hold on, we're gonna do five minutes.
[01:58:41.921 --> 01:58:45.322]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.029 --> 01:58:56.994]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:58:56.994 --> 01:58:59.095]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:58:59.095 --> 01:59:01.337]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:59:01.337 --> 01:59:02.978]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:59:02.978 --> 01:59:07.301]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:59:07.961 --> 01:59:08.441]  We're good to go!
[01:59:33.829 --> 01:59:39.792]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:59:39.792 --> 01:59:42.633]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:59:42.633 --> 01:59:53.118]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:59:53.118 --> 01:59:55.499]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.499 --> 01:59:58.280]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.833 --> 02:00:06.155]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.155 --> 02:00:07.917]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.917 --> 02:00:09.679]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.679 --> 02:00:11.261]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.261 --> 02:00:12.202]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.202 --> 02:00:17.008]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.008 --> 02:00:21.052]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.927 --> 02:00:40.652]  Coming up in the next hour, we have a member of the Icelandic Parliament who's leading the charge against not letting the British government, through banking fraud, take over their nation.
[02:00:40.652 --> 02:00:43.053]  This is economic criminal conquest.
[02:00:43.053 --> 02:00:48.294]  They've used anti-terror laws to seize the bank accounts of the entire nation.
[02:00:48.294 --> 02:00:50.615]  Now, this is just unbelievably outrageous.
[02:00:50.615 --> 02:00:53.776]  That's coming up in Kathryn Austin Fitz, the hour after that.
[02:00:53.776 --> 02:00:57.578]  We're simulcasting three hours of the four-hour radio show today.
[02:00:59.199 --> 02:01:06.602]  Uh, visually, as we do every day, at PrisonPlanet.tv for all the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers out there tuning in.
[02:01:06.602 --> 02:01:08.563]  We are simulcasting now.
[02:01:08.563 --> 02:01:10.024]  Uh, for the rest of the hour...
[02:01:11.523 --> 02:01:15.266]  Tyrell Ventura, son of Jesse Ventura.
[02:01:15.266 --> 02:01:18.189]  He's a filmmaker in his own right.
[02:01:18.189 --> 02:01:23.113]  Also is involved in a lot of other media production.
[02:01:23.113 --> 02:01:26.756]  He is an associate producer on the show, did a lot of the research.
[02:01:26.756 --> 02:01:30.839]  He's the guy that first primed the pump with his dad four or five years ago about 9-11.
[02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:40.323]  And then when I first met Jesse Ventura four years ago and gave him Terror Storm and some other films about government-sponsored terror, he said, yeah, my son's introduced me to this.
[02:01:40.323 --> 02:01:55.207]  And so that helped break the ice and get him further informed about what was happening, leading us today to the number one new show on TruTV, record ratings for a new show, Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[02:01:56.148 --> 02:01:57.149]  And so very, very exciting.
[02:01:57.149 --> 02:02:03.957]  We'll talk about his favorite last six episodes, this final episode of the first season.
[02:02:03.957 --> 02:02:10.044]  It'll be internal politics if it doesn't get picked up for another, even longer season.
[02:02:10.044 --> 02:02:12.146]  Again, incredibly successful.
[02:02:12.146 --> 02:02:14.849]  Even the major trade publications are reporting that.
[02:02:14.849 --> 02:02:16.050]  Record ratings.
[02:02:16.050 --> 02:02:17.112]  How did this get on air?
[02:02:17.953 --> 02:02:21.997]  Uh, you know, so many facets to discuss with Tyrell Ventura.
[02:02:21.997 --> 02:02:29.665]  Then we'll also get the inside scoop on does he think his dad will run for president in 2012 and what that might look like.
[02:02:29.665 --> 02:02:31.747]  But that's coming up later in the interview.
[02:02:31.747 --> 02:02:37.472]  We'll also open the phones up some for your specific questions about the show, Conspiracy Theory on TruTV.
[02:02:37.472 --> 02:02:40.656]  The final episode of the seven-part series airing tonight.
[02:02:41.116 --> 02:02:42.677]  Well, it's happy to be here, man.
[02:02:42.677 --> 02:02:49.859]  Thank you for all the help you've given us in the production of the show and for coming on and giving Jesse a good format to use your voice and opinion.
[02:03:11.181 --> 02:03:13.702]  Well, I want to thank you for including me in the show.
[02:03:13.702 --> 02:03:25.566]  I want to thank your father, the producer, the creator, for keeping his word and really having this be a fair, fact-finding show where Jesse really goes out.
[02:03:25.566 --> 02:03:27.507]  I mean, what you're seeing is what happens.
[02:03:27.507 --> 02:03:28.967]  This is real.
[02:03:28.967 --> 02:03:33.589]  And to be part of something real and trailblazing on TV, this is groundbreaking.
[02:03:34.728 --> 02:03:44.471]  I love the fact that we were, you know, so many shows you watch like the History Channel, National Geographic and all that, they immediately go to the kind of government-sponsored sense of history.
[02:03:44.471 --> 02:03:47.812]  It was kind of nice, refreshing for all of us to work on a show.
[02:03:47.812 --> 02:03:49.493]  Let's give all these other ideas a chance.
[02:03:50.365 --> 02:04:05.591]  You know, let's not follow the status quo and let's go and find things that no one's talking about the mainstream media and then put them on TV and a lot of credit for True TV for having the guts and the fun to stand behind this and then put us on the air.
[02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:09.493]  Tyrell, I don't know how you did it.
[02:04:09.493 --> 02:04:13.058]  Your father, Jesse Ventura, had a bet going that it wouldn't air.
[02:04:13.058 --> 02:04:15.802]  He was glad to be proven wrong with the production staff.
[02:04:15.802 --> 02:04:23.674]  I mean, you guys put incredible amounts of work and research, and this was a big gamble for you guys to do this, and it's been successful, so I commend you.
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:25.641]  Oh, thank you, thank you.
[02:04:25.641 --> 02:04:28.602]  But yeah, I mean, we had a great production staff.
[02:04:28.602 --> 02:04:32.905]  You know, we worked tirelessly all summer to put this thing together.
[02:04:32.905 --> 02:04:40.309]  You know, it took a long time and a lot of convincing and a lot of different edits and a lot of that just to get the show the way it is now.
[02:04:40.309 --> 02:04:42.110]  And we're all happy with it.
[02:04:42.110 --> 02:04:46.732]  You know, we couldn't be happier with the ratings and everything else and got the fan mail coming in.
[02:04:46.732 --> 02:04:50.214]  And thank you for everyone for believing in the show and watching it.
[02:04:50.214 --> 02:04:52.856]  You know, it's been a wild ride to get this stuff on the air.
[02:04:53.556 --> 02:04:56.297]  It feels good to finally have it out there.
[02:04:56.297 --> 02:04:57.057]  Absolutely.
[02:04:57.057 --> 02:04:58.937]  Tyrell Ventura, stay there.
[02:04:58.937 --> 02:05:00.037]  We're coming right back.
[02:05:00.037 --> 02:05:04.578]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:04.578 --> 02:05:05.498]  Number one.
[02:05:05.498 --> 02:05:08.919]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:08.919 --> 02:05:09.779]  Number two.
[02:05:09.779 --> 02:05:14.680]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:15.420]  It's true.
[02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:20.281]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.281 --> 02:05:20.741]  Number three.
[02:05:21.101 --> 02:05:24.684]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:24.684 --> 02:05:29.408]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.408 --> 02:05:32.170]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.170 --> 02:05:36.634]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.634 --> 02:05:40.798]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:40.798 --> 02:05:45.562]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:45.842 --> 02:05:50.009]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:50.009 --> 02:05:51.791]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:51.791 --> 02:05:54.055]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:05:54.055 --> 02:05:56.399]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:06:00.475 --> 02:06:03.476]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:03.476 --> 02:06:08.818]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:08.818 --> 02:06:10.859]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:10.859 --> 02:06:15.860]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:17.041]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.041 --> 02:06:18.161]  When do you want it?
[02:06:18.161 --> 02:06:20.042]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:20.042 --> 02:06:21.122]  When will you need it?
[02:06:21.122 --> 02:06:23.323]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:23.323 --> 02:06:24.664]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:24.664 --> 02:06:25.964]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:26.184 --> 02:06:31.451]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:31.451 --> 02:06:35.056]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.056 --> 02:06:38.861]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:38.861 --> 02:06:40.103]  How much will you need?
[02:06:40.103 --> 02:06:41.004]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.004 --> 02:06:42.106]  How much do you want?
[02:06:42.106 --> 02:06:43.047]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.047 --> 02:06:43.848]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:44.108 --> 02:06:47.172]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:47.172 --> 02:06:48.935]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:48.935 --> 02:06:49.856]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:59.409 --> 02:07:06.395]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:07:06.395 --> 02:07:07.676]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:07:07.676 --> 02:07:08.496]  It's very real.
[02:07:08.496 --> 02:07:12.380]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[02:07:12.380 --> 02:07:16.863]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[02:07:16.863 --> 02:07:19.445]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[02:07:19.445 --> 02:07:25.230]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:30.216]  Their best-seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[02:07:30.216 --> 02:07:33.059]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[02:07:33.059 --> 02:07:35.782]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[02:07:35.782 --> 02:07:42.951]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[02:07:43.231 --> 02:07:46.956]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[02:07:46.956 --> 02:07:47.216]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:07:47.216 --> 02:07:49.139]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:08:00.970 --> 02:08:04.052]  Do you believe everything you've been told?
[02:08:04.052 --> 02:08:05.973]  Ever feel like you're being watched?
[02:08:05.973 --> 02:08:10.056]  Do you think the government is concealing vital information?
[02:08:10.056 --> 02:08:12.418]  I've heard things that'll blow your mind.
[02:08:12.418 --> 02:08:15.980]  Now, one man has the guts to seek the truth.
[02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:19.803]  I've been a governor, a fighter, a Navy SEAL.
[02:08:19.803 --> 02:08:24.526]  Jesse Ventura is not afraid to take on the institutions he was once a part of.
[02:08:24.986 --> 02:08:27.189]  This is what they don't want me to see.
[02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:32.235]  And this Wednesday, the team heads north to investigate secrets in the Arctic tundra.
[02:08:32.235 --> 02:08:34.658]  What are they hiding up there in Alaska?
[02:08:34.658 --> 02:08:36.760]  The project is called HAARP.
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:37.962]  Its function?
[02:08:37.962 --> 02:08:39.504]  Classified.
[02:08:39.504 --> 02:08:40.725]  What do you think they're doing now?
[02:08:41.265 --> 02:08:44.047]  They tell us we're up here studying the Northern Lights.
[02:08:44.047 --> 02:08:46.449]  You don't study the Northern Lights for 25 years.
[02:08:46.449 --> 02:08:47.510]  Come on.
[02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:51.853]  What type of offensive weapon does HAARP have the potential to be?
[02:08:51.853 --> 02:08:58.018]  Not only can they manipulate weather, but the idea of knocking aircraft out of the sky and leaving no residual damage.
[02:08:58.018 --> 02:09:02.141]  But in order for Jesse to find the truth, he must see it for himself.
[02:09:02.141 --> 02:09:04.563]  What you're saying to me is scary.
[02:09:04.563 --> 02:09:06.544]  Just over the ridge, it comes into view.
[02:09:06.564 --> 02:09:07.905]  There it is.
[02:09:07.905 --> 02:09:08.665]  Wow.
[02:09:08.665 --> 02:09:15.509]  Be sure you have a lot of antennas there.
[02:09:15.509 --> 02:09:19.071]  None of that doesn't look that scary from up here.
[02:09:19.071 --> 02:09:26.295]  Now that Jesse and his team have seen the facility with their own eyes, it's time for them to confront the people that run it head-on.
[02:09:26.295 --> 02:09:28.596]  Now you did formally call them.
[02:09:28.596 --> 02:09:30.417]  We called this facility.
[02:09:30.417 --> 02:09:32.178]  We called the Air Force directly.
[02:09:32.178 --> 02:09:34.139]  The installation is open to the public.
[02:09:34.719 --> 02:09:36.580]  But no one is allowed in.
[02:09:36.580 --> 02:09:40.421]  And just as the former governor approaches the gate, he's stopped.
[02:09:40.421 --> 02:09:41.041]  Come on, man.
[02:09:41.041 --> 02:09:41.961]  I'm a Navy SEAL.
[02:09:41.961 --> 02:09:46.243]  When I get denied something, I do the opposite of getting intimidated.
[02:09:46.243 --> 02:09:47.043]  I get angry.
[02:09:47.043 --> 02:09:51.644]  Jesse is about to walk right on through, when suddenly... Hold on a second, guys.
[02:09:51.644 --> 02:09:52.745]  I got a problem.
[02:09:52.745 --> 02:09:55.386]  The camera equipment begins to fail.
[02:09:55.386 --> 02:09:58.927]  The crew suspects they are being targeted with powerful radio waves.
[02:09:58.927 --> 02:10:00.747]  This is more than unclassified.
[02:10:00.747 --> 02:10:01.108]  That's bull****.
[02:10:03.317 --> 02:10:08.226]  If what happens next, find out on Conspiracy Theory with Jussie Ventura.
[02:10:11.759 --> 02:10:13.821]  Now, that was the first episode.
[02:10:13.821 --> 02:10:17.604]  The last episode in the first series is airing tonight.
[02:10:17.604 --> 02:10:21.568]  Tyrell Ventura, one of the associate producers, researchers, camera guy.
[02:10:21.568 --> 02:10:27.033]  I mean, working so hard on this project because he's the guy that woke his dad up.
[02:10:27.033 --> 02:10:28.894]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:10:28.894 --> 02:10:32.318]  Those of us that question the official story are called that.
[02:10:32.318 --> 02:10:34.820]  Tyrell, tell us about the episode coming up tonight.
[02:10:35.799 --> 02:11:04.069]  Tonight we've got 2012, and we've kind of started with all the rumblings of the whole plastic calendar and all that, but then as we kind of were, you know, we were kind of at first like, uh, sounds a little hocus-pocus, but then when we started kind of like looking in, you know, to the idea that, okay, what if, you know, some major catastrophe is on the horizon and the powerful elite know about it, and, you know, will they let, you know, would your government let the people know about it ahead of time, or would they just set out to protect themselves?
[02:11:05.106 --> 02:11:05.646]  I think so.
[02:11:23.251 --> 02:11:37.724]  Talking to you and your father and some of the other researchers early on, you guys thought that a lot of what we're hearing about 2012 is baloney, and clearly there's a lot of hype, a thousand different, you know, views and ideas about what's coming up with 2012.
[02:11:37.724 --> 02:11:49.814]  But then, after you guys did your investigation, I don't want to give away too much for tonight, you got convinced that, well, the government and rich people clearly think something's going on, and they are getting ready.
[02:11:50.772 --> 02:11:51.872]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:11:51.872 --> 02:11:55.133]  And I've talked to numerous friends of mine in like Big Oil and things like that.
[02:11:55.133 --> 02:11:57.814]  You know, like the acquaintances I have out here living in Los Angeles.
[02:11:57.814 --> 02:12:01.155]  They're kind of around a lot of power and money, especially in the film industry.
[02:12:01.155 --> 02:12:05.036]  If you ask them, you talk to some of those guys and they'll tell you about like, oh yeah, you know, I'm right.
[02:12:05.036 --> 02:12:07.997]  My family has a compound built here and that kind of thing.
[02:12:07.997 --> 02:12:08.517]  And you're kind of like,
[02:12:09.272 --> 02:12:10.173]  For what purpose?
[02:12:10.173 --> 02:12:15.097]  And it's like, well, to keep us protected, but then, you know, they'll never follow through the chain of thought of, well, why?
[02:12:15.097 --> 02:12:18.360]  What do you know that I don't know?
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:20.162]  And that's what this episode's kind of about.
[02:12:20.162 --> 02:12:29.130]  I mean, it's not specifically that the world's going to end in 2012, but if a catastrophic event were to face the world, you know, who's going to get protected?
[02:12:29.130 --> 02:12:30.251]  Not you or me.
[02:12:30.251 --> 02:12:32.994]  You know, I don't think they'd care about protecting us.
[02:12:32.994 --> 02:12:33.915]  I think they'd care more about
[02:12:34.355 --> 02:12:41.241]  You know, protecting their own power and influence and making sure that their families lived on in a catastrophic event.
[02:12:41.241 --> 02:12:42.121]  Well, exactly.
[02:12:42.121 --> 02:12:52.850]  In Switzerland, they have well-appointed facilities with food and water underground for their entire population for at least two years.
[02:12:52.850 --> 02:12:56.893]  Russia has it for their entire population for at least a year.
[02:12:57.533 --> 02:13:15.779]  Other nations have this, but growing up in Dallas, they designate the underground car garages as nuclear fallout shelters, but our government has spent more than all these other governments combined on its own secret bases and underground facilities, and the public isn't even allowed to know about it.
[02:13:15.779 --> 02:13:20.881]  The public is told if we get attacked or an asteroid hits or a bioweapon gets released,
[02:13:21.381 --> 02:13:25.004]  Or a chemical weapon gets released, sorry, you're out of luck, you're dead.
[02:13:25.004 --> 02:13:29.268]  And that, of course, giving people an idea, is what this episode gets into.
[02:13:29.268 --> 02:13:32.611]  I mean, this is such an important subject, and that's what's so amazing.
[02:13:32.611 --> 02:13:47.664]  You guys set out to investigate, you know, these modern issues that the media calls conspiracy theories, and on issue after issue, you actually find out the real truth and come to the same perspective that I've got from deep research
[02:13:48.204 --> 02:13:52.907]  And that is what is so amazing because, you know, I don't want to overstate my role.
[02:13:52.907 --> 02:13:54.528]  I was just one consultant of many.
[02:13:54.528 --> 02:14:01.112]  You guys had always found the truth by the time you checked with me and said, what is your view on this?
[02:14:01.112 --> 02:14:02.212]  Our view is this.
[02:14:02.212 --> 02:14:13.819]  And I was always amazed by the fact that you guys came to really in-depth, well-calculated spectrum analysis of what's going on.
[02:14:15.253 --> 02:14:26.439]  You know, it's just being able to kind of, you know, look at the news as a whole, and then you do the research, and then, you know, with a lot of respect to Rahim and Ali, our other two associate producers, you know, they were fantastic.
[02:14:26.439 --> 02:14:30.661]  You can kind of see them on the show at the table, and then, you know, all the investigative team.
[02:14:30.661 --> 02:14:44.028]  You know, once you start reading the news, but reading through the news, and then looking at the, you know, sequence of events and stories and things like that, and then going out and finding the right people to talk to, and the people that are voicing a dissenting opinion of the popular opinion.
[02:14:44.868 --> 02:14:47.129]  Uh, you can start finding a lot of facts.
[02:14:47.129 --> 02:14:48.190]  It doesn't take that much.
[02:14:48.190 --> 02:14:53.092]  I mean, any person at home can, can, you know, with a few mouse clicks, can start learning the truth.
[02:14:53.092 --> 02:15:01.576]  And, you know, if they start telling their friends, then you get a nice femoral effect, and then that's when you can get the system to crack, and hopefully, you know, bring it back to what it should be.
[02:15:01.576 --> 02:15:07.858]  And not a, not a, you know, ruling class versus poor class.
[02:15:07.858 --> 02:15:08.879]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:15:08.879 --> 02:15:10.440]  I agree with you.
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:12.821]  And it's just very...
[02:15:14.401 --> 02:15:16.622]  It was just great working on the show.
[02:15:16.622 --> 02:15:25.005]  I mean, there was things I didn't know about, and I tried to pride myself on keeping ahead of what, you know, peering through the news and knowing what the truth is.
[02:15:25.005 --> 02:15:31.587]  And there were things that we discovered that I didn't even know about, you know, from the Manchurian candidates and how deep that went.
[02:15:31.587 --> 02:15:35.688]  That sounds like hocus pocus, but completely real.
[02:15:35.688 --> 02:15:39.990]  You know, to the 2012 stuff, you know, it was fascinating to work on the show.
[02:15:42.521 --> 02:15:47.884]  What is your favorite episode of The 7, Tyrell?
[02:15:47.884 --> 02:15:58.090]  My favorite episode probably of The 7 would be probably 9-11, just because that was the kind of one that me and my dad, you know, that I was able to bring to my dad and kind of open his eyes up to.
[02:15:58.090 --> 02:16:05.454]  So I've always kind of had a, hate to say this, but warm place, you know, for uncovering the facts of that, of what really happened that day.
[02:16:07.250 --> 02:16:14.993]  I just feel, obviously, we weren't told what happened that day, and a lot of questions still need to be answered.
[02:16:14.993 --> 02:16:25.959]  That was a fun one, just to see Dad really sink his teeth into something that is a pet project of his, and to finally see it put on the air, and to see the pride that he had that he was able to get a show like that on the air.
[02:16:25.959 --> 02:16:27.460]  Great episode.
[02:16:27.460 --> 02:16:28.620]  I mean, they're all fun.
[02:16:28.620 --> 02:16:30.221]  They all have moments of just
[02:16:31.144 --> 02:16:42.547]  You know, fantastic candidness and great stories and great interviews and things like that, which is all you can ask for if you're trying to put together a television show.
[02:16:42.547 --> 02:16:59.692]  Well, we don't know yet if it's going to be picked up again, but talking to your father and others, I mean, with the type of top rating success it's gotten for the channel, something's going on if Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura doesn't get picked up for a second larger season.
[02:17:00.652 --> 02:17:01.352]  Well, you never know.
[02:17:01.352 --> 02:17:05.795]  I mean, we hit the Bilderbergs pretty hard, and if they don't all compete, you never know.
[02:17:05.795 --> 02:17:09.437]  But, no, ratings are good, and, you know, the key isn't that thing I want to believe.
[02:17:09.437 --> 02:17:11.478]  You're fans of the show, and you believe in the show.
[02:17:11.478 --> 02:17:16.521]  You know, don't be afraid to write True TV and let them know you want to see a second season.
[02:17:16.521 --> 02:17:20.144]  You know, I can give you their address right here, and, you know, write into them, let them know.
[02:17:20.144 --> 02:17:23.806]  They read their mail, they listen to the viewers, they want to know what you want.
[02:17:23.806 --> 02:17:27.268]  Sure, give the address to True TV for folks.
[02:17:27.968 --> 02:17:33.692]  It's TRUTV, T-R-U-T-V, 600 3rd Avenue, New York, New York, 10016.
[02:17:33.692 --> 02:17:38.475]  And, you know, write in or go online.
[02:17:38.475 --> 02:17:40.836]  They've got a great website, you know, trutv.com.
[02:17:40.836 --> 02:17:45.760]  They actually have, under the contact list, you can go right on there.
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:47.401]  But they really pay attention...
[02:17:48.607 --> 02:17:50.789]  But they really pay attention to physical letters.
[02:17:50.789 --> 02:17:57.294]  Sure, you can go online to truetv.com and send them emails, and that's important, but physically writing a letter.
[02:17:57.294 --> 02:17:58.135]  Yep.
[02:17:58.135 --> 02:18:00.276]  And keep the show on the air.
[02:18:00.276 --> 02:18:01.998]  You know, we love Jesse, we love the show.
[02:18:01.998 --> 02:18:04.900]  If you believe in the show, then write him and let him know.
[02:18:04.900 --> 02:18:06.941]  I don't know, we'll find out.
[02:18:06.941 --> 02:18:13.747]  Last episode's tonight, hopefully get some good ratings tonight, and go out with a bang, and then we'll see what happens.
[02:18:14.588 --> 02:18:20.556]  Tyrell separately guaranteed this will be big on DVD.
[02:18:20.556 --> 02:18:26.284]  I hope you guys make a three disc set and it needs to be in stores.
[02:18:26.284 --> 02:18:29.869]  Is there a movement towards getting a DVD of the show out?
[02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:31.880]  Well, I'm sure there will be.
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:33.141]  I mean, I can't wait.
[02:18:33.141 --> 02:18:36.702]  We haven't talked about it quite yet because we're just kind of finishing up with the season.
[02:18:36.702 --> 02:18:39.343]  I'm sure in the next few months that discussion will come up.
[02:18:39.343 --> 02:18:40.784]  And, you know, I can't wait for people.
[02:18:40.784 --> 02:18:41.804]  I mean, there was a lot of stuff.
[02:18:41.804 --> 02:18:47.166]  You only get an hour, you know, to tell each story, which is actually not... it's about 45 minutes in TV time.
[02:18:48.787 --> 02:18:56.834]  You know, there's a lot of stuff we had to put on the editing floor that we wished we could put in, but had to take out, so hopefully in the DVD set we can include some of that.
[02:18:56.834 --> 02:19:02.258]  And also, man, I just, you know, the more people that have it in their hand, the more people that share it, and, you know, learn the truth, the better.
[02:19:02.998 --> 02:19:04.660]  And plus, this is groundbreaking.
[02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:10.345]  Hollywood, as Michael Breverman said on this show, is run by an old guard.
[02:19:10.345 --> 02:19:12.987]  They want to keep it in the left-right paradigm.
[02:19:12.987 --> 02:19:14.388]  Michael is really a smart guy.
[02:19:14.388 --> 02:19:16.210]  He understands all this.
[02:19:16.210 --> 02:19:18.632]  And this is groundbreaking.
[02:19:18.632 --> 02:19:22.755]  If this is successful, which it has been, it shifts the paradigm.
[02:19:22.755 --> 02:19:26.218]  And so many high-powered Hollywood people, they don't want to be liberals.
[02:19:26.218 --> 02:19:27.319]  They don't want to be conservatives.
[02:19:27.319 --> 02:19:30.042]  They want to get into reality and what's really happening.
[02:19:30.662 --> 02:19:37.986]  And so a lot of people are watching to see what happens with this show so they can start going public and going public with their own projects.
[02:19:37.986 --> 02:19:43.149]  It's a revolution against the control paradigm going on in Hollywood right now.
[02:19:43.149 --> 02:19:47.351]  And you guys are, and of course me involved as well, are right in the middle of it.
[02:19:47.351 --> 02:19:55.236]  This is so wonderful that this has turned out this good, this professional, this true to the reality.
[02:19:55.236 --> 02:19:57.597]  And it's just such a good thing, Tyrell.
[02:19:57.597 --> 02:19:59.478]  We're going to come back, talk more about the show.
[02:19:59.778 --> 02:20:00.479]  Your dad.
[02:20:00.479 --> 02:20:02.901]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[02:20:02.901 --> 02:20:04.802]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[02:20:04.802 --> 02:20:06.644]  No More Mortgage can change your life.
[02:20:06.644 --> 02:20:08.085]  We paid off all of our bills.
[02:20:08.085 --> 02:20:10.868]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[02:20:10.868 --> 02:20:16.532]  With No More Mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[02:20:16.532 --> 02:20:18.194]  Even have more money left over each month?
[02:20:18.194 --> 02:20:20.816]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[02:20:20.816 --> 02:20:21.277]  No More Mortgage.
[02:20:23.298 --> 02:20:24.579]  Where have they been all of our life?
[02:20:24.579 --> 02:20:27.081]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[02:20:27.081 --> 02:20:30.983]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[02:20:30.983 --> 02:20:33.125]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.

[02:20:48.435 --> 02:20:48.875]  Call the number.
[02:20:52.998 --> 02:20:54.239]  Call now for your free CD.

[02:20:54.359 --> 02:20:54.519]  800-578-6279.
[02:20:54.519 --> 02:20:56.940]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:20:56.940 --> 02:20:58.842]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:20:58.842 --> 02:21:01.904]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:21:11.047 --> 02:21:13.728]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:13.728 --> 02:21:20.109]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:20.109 --> 02:21:25.651]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:25.651 --> 02:21:28.471]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:21:28.471 --> 02:21:35.293]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:35.413 --> 02:21:37.755]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:37.755 --> 02:21:39.335]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:39.335 --> 02:21:41.797]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:41.797 --> 02:21:43.918]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:43.918 --> 02:21:49.082]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:22:00.282 --> 02:22:10.307]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:22:10.307 --> 02:22:16.750]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[02:22:16.750 --> 02:22:25.594]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:22:25.974 --> 02:22:35.166]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:22:35.166 --> 02:22:39.772]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world-reserved currency.
[02:22:39.772 --> 02:22:41.575]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:41.575 --> 02:22:44.078]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[02:22:44.358 --> 02:22:47.682]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:47.682 --> 02:22:51.867]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[02:22:51.867 --> 02:22:52.748]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:52.748 --> 02:22:53.108]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.814 --> 02:23:08.024]  For the first time ever, the makers of Alpine Air Foods have approved an incredible sale with savings only available through ready-made resources.
[02:23:08.024 --> 02:23:13.091]  For a limited time, save 25% off all cases of freeze-dried foods by Alpine Air.
[02:23:13.091 --> 02:23:15.674]  Yes, 25% off on case lots only of Alpine Air.
[02:23:15.714 --> 02:23:16.916]  We're good to go.
[02:23:35.558 --> 02:23:36.338]  We're good to go.
[02:24:14.534 --> 02:24:24.018]  Tyrell Ventura, filmmaker, researcher, son of Jesse Ventura, is the guy that woke his father up.
[02:24:24.018 --> 02:24:32.061]  We are excited to have him with us today, talking about the final episode of the first season of Conspiracy Theory.
[02:24:32.842 --> 02:24:36.827]  With Jesse Ventura the last show premieres tonight 9 p.m.
[02:24:36.827 --> 02:24:38.028]  Central 10 p.m.
[02:24:38.028 --> 02:24:49.584]  Eastern on true TV Getting more into tonight's episode I mean as much as you're allowed to tell the public give people an idea of Why they want to tune in tonight Tyrell
[02:24:51.331 --> 02:25:02.175]  Tonight, because you're going to find out just what, how the government, you know, could prepare for potential disaster and leave you, you know, above ground.
[02:25:02.175 --> 02:25:04.536]  If any, I mean, that's kind of where we went with this episode.
[02:25:04.536 --> 02:25:20.323]  It was fascinating to dig in and see that, you know, in every emergency situation, you know, and all the government, you know, and all their files and where they, you know, and in their, what's the word, the power structure, you know, keeping the power structure in place takes priority to the citizenry.
[02:25:21.318 --> 02:25:24.159]  And it's very frightening to think about that.
[02:25:24.159 --> 02:25:27.740]  And that's what we get into this episode.
[02:25:27.740 --> 02:25:36.502]  And we also, you know, uncover some massive underground facilities and other such places right underneath your nose.
[02:25:36.502 --> 02:25:38.822]  And it's a fun episode.
[02:25:38.822 --> 02:25:43.764]  You know, watch him, Jesse, go bunker busting.
[02:25:43.764 --> 02:25:44.864]  And we'll leave it at that.
[02:25:44.864 --> 02:25:47.865]  Believe me, I think this is one of the strongest episodes.
[02:25:47.865 --> 02:25:49.385]  What episode really is your favorite?
[02:25:50.638 --> 02:26:05.747]  Uh, like I said, probably 9-11, uh, and global warming was interesting, too, because I'd never, you know, I always assumed that global warming was real, and like we say in the show, we were not debating the science of whether it's real or not, we just started debating our ideas that are being presented.
[02:26:06.797 --> 02:26:09.619]  Uh, to help stop this, this problem.
[02:26:09.619 --> 02:26:15.642]  You know, are they really going to stop the problem or are they just going to make the wealthy more wealthy and then make people rich?
[02:26:15.642 --> 02:26:21.184]  Yeah, personally, my favorite episode, uh, is the global warming because you just destroyed them.
[02:26:21.184 --> 02:26:22.285]  You have Ben Santer.
[02:26:22.285 --> 02:26:32.690]  I mean, that, I mean, that made newspaper news that he admitted the head of the UN program that they took out five scientists who in the report said, man is not causing global warming.
[02:26:33.370 --> 02:26:40.733]  And the UN knew that 10 years ago, on top of ClimateGate, that is as big as the emails.
[02:26:40.733 --> 02:26:41.934]  Oh, it's fantastic.
[02:26:41.934 --> 02:26:46.096]  I mean, the timing of that episode and what was going on in the world at that moment was...
[02:26:47.662 --> 02:26:48.823]  Couldn't have been better.
[02:26:48.823 --> 02:26:55.466]  It was just one of those great moments in time where you're on top of a story as another facet of the story breaks.
[02:26:55.466 --> 02:27:00.349]  I was very critical of the global warming.
[02:27:00.349 --> 02:27:08.114]  The more research we did, the more I was convinced that there was definitely something sneaky going on there.
[02:27:08.114 --> 02:27:11.976]  Hopefully, the more people you get talking about these issues, the more we can try to change it.
[02:27:12.496 --> 02:27:21.499]  I mean, that's the whole point of doing shows like this, is to get you talking, get you aware of what's going on around you, not just being spoon-fed to everything you see on television.
[02:27:21.499 --> 02:27:27.401]  And when you see those... I didn't really open my dad's eyes up to the world of conspiracy theory.
[02:27:27.401 --> 02:27:31.202]  He definitely did that when he took me to see the movie JFK when I was a little kid.
[02:27:31.202 --> 02:27:36.183]  I was, like, 10, 11 years old, and so he definitely opened it up to that.
[02:27:36.183 --> 02:27:40.665]  I was able to kind of open his eyes up to the 9-11, because, you know, like all of us,
[02:27:41.645 --> 02:27:46.167]  Shocked and had our head in the sand to a certain degree after that had happened.
[02:27:46.167 --> 02:27:51.750]  And then at first he was real hesitant to buy in, but then I just kept saying, just watch the blues change.
[02:27:51.750 --> 02:27:52.290]  Watch this.
[02:27:52.290 --> 02:27:54.911]  It raises enough questions it'll make you think about it.
[02:27:54.911 --> 02:27:59.153]  And then that kind of got him rolling on 9-11 and then opened up.
[02:27:59.153 --> 02:28:10.198]  You know, really that got him rolling and ended up creating this show to a certain extent because it kind of opened his mind up to other vast conspiracies, the other conspiracies out there beyond just JFK.
[02:28:11.078 --> 02:28:31.419]  Well, sure, Tyrell, but I mean, talking to your dad the last time he was down here in Austin with me for a few days, I mean, he said he knew about JFK, he knew about some of the things, but that you had brought him so many books and evidence and material, and that I'd given him material, and then all of that, that he went down to Mexico and spent months and months reading and watching it all and doing research, and that he really had this
[02:28:32.821 --> 02:28:33.321]  I don't know.
[02:28:50.871 --> 02:29:02.236]  And that's the same process that all of us go through, even when we think we know what's going on, even when we think we're aware of the New World Order and the shadow government, it just gets more and more crazy.
[02:29:02.236 --> 02:29:15.002]  And this microcosm of the underground bases, how there's this giant archipelago of underground bases and continuity of government facilities that are even on record to exist.
[02:29:15.002 --> 02:29:20.224]  Imagine what we don't know exists, and the general public has no idea all this is going on beneath them.
[02:29:21.104 --> 02:29:24.565]  I know, and they have no idea that most of their taxpayers are paying for all of it.
[02:29:24.565 --> 02:29:26.826]  Most of their taxpayers are paying for all of it.
[02:29:26.826 --> 02:29:34.528]  You know, I mean, you want to know what you're buying and what, I mean, they're taking your money to do all this and to run this, these regimes that do this.
[02:29:34.528 --> 02:29:41.630]  Uh, you know, not to mention, you know, the selling of drugs, you know, not to mention the CIA selling of drugs on the city, you know, on the inner city streets and all of that.
[02:29:41.630 --> 02:29:43.951]  I mean, you know, they're totally abusing you.
[02:29:43.951 --> 02:29:49.113]  I mean, it's no different than when the, you know, feudal lords were abusing the Serbs, you know, back in the, you know, 1300s, I think.
[02:29:50.834 --> 02:29:54.763]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.763 --> 02:29:57.469]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.219 --> 02:30:04.761]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:04.761 --> 02:30:05.661]  Number one.
[02:30:05.661 --> 02:30:09.103]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.103 --> 02:30:09.963]  Number two.
[02:30:09.963 --> 02:30:14.845]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:14.845 --> 02:30:15.585]  It's true.
[02:30:15.585 --> 02:30:20.147]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:20.447 --> 02:30:21.288]  Number 3.
[02:30:21.288 --> 02:30:24.871]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:24.871 --> 02:30:28.795]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:28.795 --> 02:30:29.575]  Number 4.
[02:30:29.575 --> 02:30:32.338]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.338 --> 02:30:36.021]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.021 --> 02:30:36.822]  Number 5.
[02:30:36.822 --> 02:30:40.966]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:40.966 --> 02:30:45.730]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.010 --> 02:30:50.173]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:50.173 --> 02:30:51.975]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:51.975 --> 02:30:54.217]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:30:54.217 --> 02:30:56.558]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:01.840 --> 02:31:05.801]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:05.801 --> 02:31:14.663]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:14.663 --> 02:31:19.284]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:19.284 --> 02:31:30.106]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:30.746 --> 02:31:40.255]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:40.255 --> 02:31:45.680]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:45.680 --> 02:31:53.186]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:53.186 --> 02:31:55.929]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:32:01.030 --> 02:32:05.054]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:05.054 --> 02:32:08.297]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:08.297 --> 02:32:13.101]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:32:13.101 --> 02:32:19.507]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:19.507 --> 02:32:21.750]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:22.270 --> 02:32:22.570]  Tim Geithner?
[02:32:22.570 --> 02:32:23.091]  Bernanke?
[02:32:23.091 --> 02:32:23.751]  They're arsonists!
[02:32:23.751 --> 02:32:25.032]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:25.032 --> 02:32:27.273]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:41.161 --> 02:32:43.022]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:32:43.022 --> 02:32:48.443]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:32:48.443 --> 02:32:57.566]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:01.875 --> 02:33:05.418]  Alex, we always hear the term New World Order.
[02:33:05.418 --> 02:33:06.658]  What is that?
[02:33:06.658 --> 02:33:11.722]  The New World Order is the establishment's catch-all phrase for all these groups and organizations.
[02:33:11.722 --> 02:33:13.163]  Everything we've talked about.
[02:33:13.163 --> 02:33:17.066]  It's the name of their agenda, the global elite's vision for the planet.
[02:33:17.066 --> 02:33:21.689]  It is a hellish prison planet controlled by them against a defenseless public.
[02:33:22.169 --> 02:33:23.710]  How come this isn't exposed?
[02:33:23.710 --> 02:33:24.910]  They did report on it.
[02:33:24.910 --> 02:33:27.851]  The Council on Foreign Relations now goes on C-SPAN.
[02:33:27.851 --> 02:33:29.132]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:33:29.132 --> 02:33:36.995]  Now more and more, they just come right out with it.
[02:33:36.995 --> 02:33:38.096]  Okay, here's the deal.
[02:33:38.096 --> 02:33:47.239]  We've got Tyrell Ventura, part of the production team, associate producer, camera guy, researcher on conspiracy theory.
[02:33:47.239 --> 02:33:48.400]  The last episode,
[02:33:50.092 --> 02:33:57.156]  2012, the Underground Bunker Program, that is coming up tonight, 9pm Central, 10pm Eastern.
[02:33:57.156 --> 02:34:09.462]  Believe me, you want to tune in and watch it the hour before they will re-air last week's show, which Jesse thinks is the most wild one, and that's the Manchurian Candidate Program that we know is real.
[02:34:09.462 --> 02:34:12.764]  Now, is every person out there saying they're a Manchurian candidate real?
[02:34:12.764 --> 02:34:12.904]  No.
[02:34:13.744 --> 02:34:18.731]  Uh, but that's going to re-air tonight, 8 o'clock Central, leading into the new episode.
[02:34:18.731 --> 02:34:30.508]  But we have callers for the guest only, questions about Jesse Ventura, questions about the series, questions about the production of Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[02:34:31.048 --> 02:34:35.851]  Tyrell Venter is here giving us a different perspective, a different angle on the production.
[02:34:35.851 --> 02:34:38.893]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 Tyrell, I want to get into your dad and politics, but before we do that,
[02:34:48.158 --> 02:34:49.999]  I've been asking the questions here.
[02:34:49.999 --> 02:34:52.300]  Any other points or ideas you were getting into government?
[02:34:52.300 --> 02:34:53.240]  Drug dealing?
[02:34:53.240 --> 02:34:54.501]  How many times they've been caught?
[02:34:54.501 --> 02:34:56.942]  CIA aircraft crashing full of cocaine?
[02:34:56.942 --> 02:34:58.202]  And you got cut off by the break.
[02:34:58.202 --> 02:35:00.143]  Any more statements on that?
[02:35:00.143 --> 02:35:02.724]  Or anything else you want to say to the audience?
[02:35:02.724 --> 02:35:15.730]  The thing I want to say, too, is don't, like, I, you know, I read the talkback section on the Facebook page for the Conspiracy Theory show, you know, for our show, and, like, all of that, and, you know, I've gotten a lot of mail, you know, to the company, to the production office, you know, of people
[02:35:16.110 --> 02:35:16.691]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:35:31.758 --> 02:35:37.160]  You know, interviewing people out there and finding the truth of stories is what's going to help us.
[02:35:37.160 --> 02:35:44.243]  If you've got a little nugget of information about something that maybe you yourself are afraid to bring to public, you know, we can.
[02:35:44.243 --> 02:35:44.963]  We can do that.
[02:35:44.963 --> 02:36:00.429]  If we get picked up, you know, that's why you've got to watch a show and write to TruTV and get us picked up for a second season so we can keep telling the truth on, you know, we've got Alex doing it on the radio and in DVDs and if we can keep doing it on TV, you know, that creates the ground to fall and hopefully you can change the world that way.
[02:36:01.522 --> 02:36:17.246]  Well, there's no doubt that there's a huge awakening taking place, and you guys were already aware of that, but producing the show, being out there on the street, really plunging with both feet into the alternative media and bringing it to mainstream media, building that bridge.
[02:36:17.246 --> 02:36:26.469]  This is unprecedented, trailblazing, avant-garde event that we've all witnessed, and I've just been honored to be involved in it.
[02:36:26.469 --> 02:36:30.030]  What has it been like truly immersing yourself in this, Tyrell?
[02:36:31.266 --> 02:36:53.362]  Well, I mean, it's like you say, your head starts spinning after a while and it's tough sometimes to decipher which person's telling you the truth, which person isn't, whose side should you take in this, who's got the most information on any subject that's going to fit right for the show and the style of show and the editing.
[02:36:53.362 --> 02:36:55.924]  I mean, it was a tough, long thing to put together.
[02:36:55.924 --> 02:36:56.645]  You know what I mean?
[02:36:57.668 --> 02:37:06.957]  You know, interviewing people, sending Jesse up to Alaska, going all over the place, and the government's not being helpful at all.
[02:37:06.957 --> 02:37:08.298]  It was a fun shoot to do.
[02:37:08.298 --> 02:37:12.222]  I worked with great people all around, and Jesse had a great time doing it.
[02:37:12.222 --> 02:37:15.425]  But yeah, your head starts spinning after a while because you get so...
[02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:17.161]  We're good to go.
[02:37:30.572 --> 02:37:36.215]  Got to just grab the best things you can and hope for the best.
[02:37:36.215 --> 02:37:40.877]  I haven't talked to your dad in the last three weeks since he left to get down to Mexico.
[02:37:40.877 --> 02:37:44.398]  Talking to him over email down there.
[02:37:44.398 --> 02:37:47.059]  He was super excited when I talked to him three weeks ago.
[02:37:47.059 --> 02:37:50.841]  Is he even more excited now that the ratings have just continued?
[02:37:51.718 --> 02:37:53.019]  Oh, of course he's excited.
[02:37:53.019 --> 02:37:56.542]  I mean, now we're just kind of all waiting to see and hope we get picked up.
[02:37:56.542 --> 02:38:00.605]  He loves the show and is very happy with it.
[02:38:00.605 --> 02:38:05.048]  And you know, a lot of, like I say, a lot of love to True TV.
[02:38:05.048 --> 02:38:10.492]  They never once, you know, really stepped in and said, no, you can't talk about this, or yes, you can.
[02:38:10.492 --> 02:38:12.394]  I mean, they were very hands-off.
[02:38:13.194 --> 02:38:16.796]  You know, I mean, you know, and they're a very good, very good company to work for.
[02:38:16.796 --> 02:38:21.178]  Simulation Productions, which is the production company that put it together.
[02:38:21.178 --> 02:38:22.759]  Uh, you know, great people to work for.
[02:38:22.759 --> 02:38:24.320]  Like I said, very hands-off, surprising.
[02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:27.041]  You know, I was expecting, you know, the worst.
[02:38:27.041 --> 02:38:30.903]  And you get into, like, you know, media conglomerates and, you know, their own Mike Turner and all that.
[02:38:30.903 --> 02:38:34.505]  You never know what you're going to get into, but they were, they were fantastic to work with.
[02:38:36.044 --> 02:38:48.020]  Well, I was involved in a big production for Discovery Channel with the director who did some kind of Monster Brothers Keeper and a lot of other top documentary films.
[02:38:48.020 --> 02:38:49.362]  I mean, the very top of the genre.
[02:38:50.043 --> 02:38:53.547]  And he said, I've never seen this in 20 plus years of filmmaking.
[02:38:53.547 --> 02:38:55.048]  The whole show was done.
[02:38:55.048 --> 02:38:59.393]  Executives came in and said, we're not doing this anti-New World Order stuff.
[02:38:59.393 --> 02:39:04.979]  $3.4 million budget killed the entire program.
[02:39:06.005 --> 02:39:19.470]  And I've seen that over and over again where the system does do this, but talking to your dad and other people in the production, they say that his personality, his gravitas, his research, you know, proving it.
[02:39:19.470 --> 02:39:23.111]  You know, he told TruTV, you know, I'm going in to just find the truth.
[02:39:23.111 --> 02:39:23.971]  I have an open mind.
[02:39:23.971 --> 02:39:25.232]  He found the truth.
[02:39:25.232 --> 02:39:28.053]  It's our perspective because we are telling the truth.
[02:39:28.053 --> 02:39:33.935]  And it is the first national television show that actually comes from the reality perspective
[02:39:34.635 --> 02:39:38.836]  And, so how do you think this got on air?
[02:39:38.836 --> 02:39:53.860]  I think it got on air, I mean, I think A, the truth TV, you know, believed in Jesse and, you know, had the guts, you know, the executives up there had the guts to say, you know, let's take a gamble on this and let's take a chance, but there's an audience out there for this, which we've found that there is.
[02:39:53.860 --> 02:40:01.182]  And also, I think, you know, we probably got it under the radar a little bit, you know, Jesse hadn't really been on the public eye for a while and, you know, I think we flipped it by him.
[02:40:02.902 --> 02:40:05.903]  In terms of the media elite and the powers that be.
[02:40:05.903 --> 02:40:07.404]  I think we kind of split this one by them.
[02:40:07.404 --> 02:40:16.587]  But the great thing about Hollywood and television and all of that is as much as they will push an agenda, they still love money.
[02:40:16.587 --> 02:40:19.067]  And in TV it's advertising dollars.
[02:40:19.067 --> 02:40:27.390]  So like we say, the more people that watch the show, the more people that want it on the air and want this kind of information out there, you've got to write in and tell them to pick us up for the second piece.
[02:40:31.873 --> 02:40:42.581]  Well, there is no doubt that if you put this on primetime CBS, ABC, NBC, or Fox, that this would be a number one show.
[02:40:42.581 --> 02:40:45.503]  And I know there's been some discussion down the road.
[02:40:45.503 --> 02:40:51.587]  I mean, we need to get another season on cable, but this needs to go to primetime television.
[02:40:51.587 --> 02:40:54.149]  Now, I don't think the powers that be are going to let that happen.
[02:40:55.493 --> 02:40:56.014]  Oh, who knows?
[02:40:56.014 --> 02:41:06.922]  I mean, that primetime television is so locked into, you know, sitcoms that mean nothing and everything else, but, you know, and then, you know, murder investigation stories that aren't true.
[02:41:06.922 --> 02:41:17.690]  You know, that's the great thing about being, you know, on true TV and working with them is, you know, we're dealing, like it says, we're not, you know, we're dealing, uh, not reality, but actuality, you know, and it's a great network to work for.
[02:41:17.690 --> 02:41:19.271]  This is a real Perry Mason.
[02:41:19.271 --> 02:41:21.313]  I mean, you guys go out into a real investigation.
[02:41:21.963 --> 02:41:25.944]  Yeah, we're not, you know, we're not CSI out there pretending, you know, fake dead bodies.
[02:41:25.944 --> 02:41:29.506]  These are real issues we're dealing with, and, you know, real people we're interviewing.
[02:41:29.506 --> 02:41:37.969]  You know, and that's what's so fun about the show is, you know, going in to play that meeting, you know, meeting a man who says he's a Manchurian candidate.
[02:41:37.969 --> 02:41:45.671]  You know, I shook his hand, I talked to him, and I don't know if he's telling the truth or not, but I can tell you this is that he believes in what he's saying.
[02:41:45.671 --> 02:41:47.632]  Well, we know those programs are real.
[02:41:48.764 --> 02:41:55.366]  And we know he had the car wreck and suddenly remembered all of this, and that's exactly, in the real cases, how this has happened.
[02:41:55.366 --> 02:42:00.949]  I mean, CIA officers like Olson died in these mind control programs.
[02:42:00.949 --> 02:42:02.209]  I mean, this is declassified.
[02:42:03.050 --> 02:42:04.531]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:42:04.531 --> 02:42:08.874]  But to get out there and meet those people, I hope.
[02:42:08.874 --> 02:42:14.918]  I can't wait for another season because there's a lot of other stories out there that we weren't able to get this time around.
[02:42:14.918 --> 02:42:19.021]  Like I say, get good ratings tonight and everything else and we'll have a lot of fun next year.
[02:42:19.961 --> 02:42:28.250]  Tyrell, give people the address of the different websites that you run in association with the Conspiracy Theory Show.
[02:42:28.250 --> 02:42:34.237]  Contact info, contact for TruTV, some of the places people can interface with you and send you information.
[02:42:35.091 --> 02:42:43.195]  Yeah, they can, uh, I mean, you can, you can definitely, uh, send mail to TruTV, which is at 600 3rd Avenue, New York, New York 10016.
[02:42:43.195 --> 02:42:51.640]  Uh, I check on, uh, the, uh, Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura at Facebook.com, you know, go on there, and then, you know, post things on there.
[02:42:51.640 --> 02:42:55.162]  I definitely read all the, all the, uh, talkback stuff in there.
[02:42:55.162 --> 02:43:02.826]  Um, you know, so, uh, go onto the TruTV website, uh, right through there, and then, you know, just voice your opinion and be heard, you know?
[02:43:03.817 --> 02:43:04.918]  Okay, shifting gears.
[02:43:04.918 --> 02:43:05.859]  I know, it's a deluge.
[02:43:05.859 --> 02:43:10.622]  Shifting gears, I have congressmen on, I have political analysts on every week.
[02:43:24.861 --> 02:43:30.949]  I have top reporters on, people that really understand politics, the political landscape.
[02:43:30.949 --> 02:43:36.336]  The Republicans have no credibility, the Democrats have no credibility, no matter who we put into office.
[02:43:37.100 --> 02:43:38.281]  Governments get bigger.
[02:43:38.281 --> 02:43:39.802]  The wars get bigger.
[02:43:39.802 --> 02:43:41.002]  Our freedoms get attacked.
[02:43:41.002 --> 02:43:42.823]  The banks are looting us.
[02:43:42.823 --> 02:43:48.046]  The Democrats and Republicans in all the major polls don't want the government takeover of health care.
[02:43:48.046 --> 02:43:50.507]  They found out it's not free health care.
[02:43:50.507 --> 02:43:51.428]  No such animal.
[02:43:51.428 --> 02:43:55.550]  It's a boondoggle to the insurance companies.
[02:43:55.550 --> 02:43:58.952]  Even Howard Dean, head of the Democratic Party, is saying that.
[02:43:58.952 --> 02:44:00.493]  So people are really angry.
[02:44:00.493 --> 02:44:04.475]  And every time I talk to political strategists, they see no one
[02:44:05.349 --> 02:44:11.047]  Out there with the name recognition or who has the dark horse history.
[02:44:11.957 --> 02:44:19.862]  And the populist backing to run for president except for Ron Paul and Jesse Ventura.
[02:44:19.862 --> 02:44:27.107]  And some people say Ron Paul, almost 75, will be 77 if he got elected.
[02:44:27.107 --> 02:44:27.948]  That's too old.
[02:44:27.948 --> 02:44:30.930]  I think he's in great shape, jogs every day, exercises.
[02:44:30.930 --> 02:44:32.011]  I don't think that's the case.
[02:44:32.011 --> 02:44:32.911]  I love Ron Paul.
[02:44:32.911 --> 02:44:33.892]  I support him.
[02:44:33.892 --> 02:44:35.073]  I know Governor Ventura.
[02:44:35.793 --> 02:44:44.038]  Uh, is really waking up, truly, uh, you know, just gets better and better like fine wine as he politically grows.
[02:44:44.038 --> 02:44:45.138]  He's a real guy.
[02:44:45.138 --> 02:44:46.339]  He keeps his word.
[02:44:46.339 --> 02:44:47.820]  He doesn't want special interest.
[02:44:47.820 --> 02:44:49.241]  He can't be bought off.
[02:44:49.241 --> 02:44:50.881]  The media is demonizing for that.
[02:44:50.881 --> 02:44:56.464]  He was against the war right when it first happened, when many others were for it and then later said they were against it.
[02:44:56.464 --> 02:44:59.386]  You know, I mean, he's been right on so many issues.
[02:44:59.386 --> 02:45:00.747]  I disagree with him on a few, but you know,
[02:45:01.767 --> 02:45:03.288]  Everybody disagrees with each other.
[02:45:03.288 --> 02:45:05.470]  Nobody agrees 100%.
[02:45:05.470 --> 02:45:12.076]  But all these experts, and myself included, think that... And I know he wants to have his own life.
[02:45:12.076 --> 02:45:23.246]  He said, Alex, when you get to the age I am, that time becomes the most valuable thing, not money, not fame, not even... He said, I just want to do the right thing.
[02:45:23.246 --> 02:45:28.671]  I'm torn between being politically involved with all the nastiness and having to be around all the crooks in Washington,
[02:45:29.191 --> 02:45:35.396]  You know, if I do do it, I would purely do it if the people are ready and want a true revolution back to the Constitution.
[02:45:35.396 --> 02:45:37.217]  You know, these are the private discussions we've had.
[02:45:37.217 --> 02:45:38.638]  We've had some on air.
[02:45:38.638 --> 02:45:42.821]  Can you tell us as much as you can about what your dad's really thinking, what he's doing?
[02:45:42.821 --> 02:45:50.146]  He's gotta know that he's being looked at to run for president and that he's needed.
[02:45:50.146 --> 02:45:50.827]  Tyrell Ventura.
[02:45:52.375 --> 02:45:56.980]  You know, he does know that, and he does, you know, hear the people out there.
[02:45:56.980 --> 02:46:04.667]  I mean, there's numerous websites and things, you know, asking, you know, Jesse, you're running 2012, and, you know, we need you, and that kind of thing.
[02:46:04.667 --> 02:46:07.169]  And, you know, I can tell you this.
[02:46:07.169 --> 02:46:11.934]  My father's a big believer in fate, that if fate opens its door and says, you know, looks
[02:46:11.954 --> 02:46:14.096]  It's a strange funny world we live in and you never know what can happen.
[02:46:32.833 --> 02:46:44.473]  But as of right now, no, he doesn't have any political ambitions right now, except for just waking people up and continue to be a voice of independence and a voice of revolution.
[02:46:45.137 --> 02:46:54.060]  Well, that's what he's told me, and people always ask me to run for office, and the reason I've said I will probably never do it is that I can be pure here.
[02:46:54.060 --> 02:47:13.386]  Nobody's telling me what to say, I can do whatever I want, I can tell the truth, I can feel good when I go to bed at night, and politics itself is inherently corrupting, inherently is about compromise, and your dad knows he can write books, he can do TV and radio interviews, he can have a hit TV show telling the truth, trailblazing, and that
[02:47:13.846 --> 02:47:23.493]  And that he wants to be, from the grassroots, part of the revolution against tyranny with the people, as a foot soldier, as a commando, as a Navy SEAL.
[02:47:23.493 --> 02:47:30.858]  That's what he sees as that front line general out there, you know, on the front lines, in the fight.
[02:47:31.710 --> 02:47:37.973]  You know what it is, Alex, is that one of the greatest experiences he ever had in his life was teaching political science at Harvard.
[02:47:37.973 --> 02:47:49.377]  You know, and they had him come out there for a semester at Harvard and was able to teach all these young kids about third party politics and about 9-11 and about JFK and things like that.
[02:47:49.377 --> 02:47:51.458]  And he was able to really, you know, kind of
[02:47:52.051 --> 02:47:53.953]  Those are the people that are going to change the world.
[02:47:53.953 --> 02:48:00.602]  I think my dad's kind of getting to a point in his life now where he would rather inspire the person who is going to change the world rather than change the world.
[02:48:00.602 --> 02:48:02.925]  He's taken it pretty far now.
[02:48:02.925 --> 02:48:09.132]  He's gone from governor and everything else, but I think as he gets up there, he wants to surf more.
[02:48:09.132 --> 02:48:10.574]  He kind of wants to pass the reins on.
[02:48:11.553 --> 02:48:19.942]  You know, hopefully, uh, you know, there's someone out there who will have that curriculum, will have that, that, that third-party know-how to, uh, you know, take, take this country back for us.
[02:48:19.942 --> 02:48:21.423]  And, uh, but it starts with all of us.
[02:48:21.423 --> 02:48:22.765]  It doesn't take one person.
[02:48:22.765 --> 02:48:24.867]  You can't put your faith in just one person.
[02:48:24.867 --> 02:48:31.994]  Tyrell, I want to hold you... Tyrell, I want to hold you five minutes in the next hour, if you can, so we have two, two short segments to be able to take calls.
[02:48:31.994 --> 02:48:32.835]  You can do that, can't you?
[02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:34.909]  Okay, great.
[02:48:34.909 --> 02:48:45.273]  We're going to come back and go to Noel, Mark, Rose, Ron, Tim, and others for Tyrell Ventura specifically on the show or Jesse Ventura or on Tyrell.
[02:48:45.273 --> 02:48:47.853]  But I just want to say this here as we go to break.
[02:48:47.853 --> 02:48:54.856]  Studying the Founding Fathers, they weren't perfect, they were men, but they had good hearts and they were intelligent and they truly wanted liberty.
[02:48:54.856 --> 02:48:58.317]  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, those are icons, those are my idols.
[02:49:00.390 --> 02:49:08.614]  Really getting to know your dad and studying now in hindsight what he's done in his life and knowing that he doesn't want to be president.
[02:49:08.614 --> 02:49:10.235]  He doesn't want the power.
[02:49:10.235 --> 02:49:14.817]  He doesn't want to have the attention and be at all the big dinners.
[02:49:14.817 --> 02:49:16.158]  He just wants freedom.
[02:49:16.158 --> 02:49:20.880]  That's just like George Washington who turned in his command.
[02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:21.821]  They wanted him to be king.
[02:49:21.821 --> 02:49:22.381]  He said no.
[02:49:23.241 --> 02:49:27.365]  And then they basically drafted him to run for president, and all he wanted to do was get back to Mount Vernon.
[02:49:27.365 --> 02:49:30.847]  He wanted to leave New York and, you know, go back to where Washington, D.C.
[02:49:30.847 --> 02:49:32.609]  is today, his farm.
[02:49:32.609 --> 02:49:37.512]  And so that's exactly why we need your dad to run for president, because I've genuinely looked into his eyes.
[02:49:37.512 --> 02:49:44.438]  He doesn't want to do it because he doesn't want to be around all that corrupt slime, and he just wants to be a common person.
[02:49:44.438 --> 02:49:48.241]  But then he wants to run because he knows he wants to put real issues out.
[02:49:48.761 --> 02:49:50.982]  Imagine all these scumbag politicians.
[02:49:50.982 --> 02:49:53.563]  They would kill their children to be president.
[02:49:53.563 --> 02:49:55.484]  And that's why we don't want them to be president.
[02:49:55.484 --> 02:49:57.165]  Ron Paul doesn't want to run for president.
[02:49:57.165 --> 02:49:58.306]  I've talked to him privately.
[02:49:58.306 --> 02:50:02.127]  He wants to, you know, but he fights tirelessly because of duty.
[02:50:02.127 --> 02:50:05.429]  Your dad doesn't want to be president, but he does want to stop the New World Order.
[02:50:06.423 --> 02:50:08.644]  Yes, yes, of course.
[02:50:08.644 --> 02:50:09.505]  Completely.
[02:50:09.505 --> 02:50:12.466]  You couldn't have said it better.
[02:50:12.466 --> 02:50:18.490]  He just wants to continue his right and to open people's minds up and to get people thinking of third party.
[02:50:18.490 --> 02:50:20.411]  Don't fall into the left or the right.
[02:50:20.411 --> 02:50:21.732]  Be your own person.
[02:50:21.732 --> 02:50:23.233]  Be an independent thinker.
[02:50:23.233 --> 02:50:24.733]  Study the founding fathers.
[02:50:24.733 --> 02:50:28.616]  Learn what they created here in this great, great country we have.
[02:50:28.616 --> 02:50:31.077]  And then don't let it fall into the hands of the ruthless and the corrupt.
[02:50:31.866 --> 02:50:58.236]  Well, your dad really does, with all of his colorful history and all the great things he's done as a trailblazer, the fact that he doesn't want power, the fact that he just wants to be on a lonely seashore by himself reading books, that's why he needs to be president or somebody like Ron Paul, instead of Sarah Palin and the Democrats and the Republicans, all these painted trollops and trumpets who want power.
[02:50:58.236 --> 02:50:59.957]  That's the people we don't want in government.
[02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:03.101]  A revolution in smoking is underway.
[02:51:03.101 --> 02:51:06.962]  A revolution all smokers of traditional cigarettes should know about.

[02:52:02.194 --> 02:52:06.216]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.

[02:52:20.628 --> 02:52:26.193]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.193 --> 02:52:35.822]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:35.922 --> 02:52:38.263]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.263 --> 02:52:39.864]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:39.864 --> 02:52:42.326]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.326 --> 02:52:44.447]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.447 --> 02:52:49.591]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:54:40.717 --> 02:54:42.117]  Very, very exciting.
[02:54:42.117 --> 02:54:45.918]  We've got this segment and the next with Tyrell Ventura and I'm going to your calls but Tyrell
[02:54:46.576 --> 02:54:52.320]  During the break, you made a statement that was not conclusive, but closer to conclusive.
[02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:55.583]  So, finish up that statement about your dad.
[02:54:55.583 --> 02:54:57.084]  Well, essentially, I'm going to say this.
[02:54:57.084 --> 02:55:01.027]  Like, you know, you asked me, is he going to run for president in 2012 and things like that.
[02:55:01.027 --> 02:55:07.271]  And I say, you know, right now, I would say I'm probably 85% sure that he's not going to run for president.
[02:55:09.020 --> 02:55:14.524]  Uh, you know, his life has been so dynamic and strange that, you know, you never can say never with him.
[02:55:14.524 --> 02:55:16.785]  Uh, so he, you know, who knows?
[02:55:16.785 --> 02:55:25.811]  Uh, you know, uh, if he'd have told me that we'd have the Conspiracy Theory Show on and we'd be getting great ratings, uh, if you were to go ahead and say, like, oh, no way they'd ever put it on, but they did.
[02:55:25.811 --> 02:55:30.214]  Uh, if he'd told me he was gonna run for governor and win, I'd have said, no way, but he did.
[02:55:30.214 --> 02:55:30.874]  So you never know.
[02:55:30.874 --> 02:55:38.179]  You never know with him, but, uh, but, uh, as of right now, doesn't look like he's running, but, but, uh, you know, never say never.
[02:55:39.699 --> 02:55:41.321]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:41.321 --> 02:55:46.488]  Jesse wants to ride off into the sunset with his TV show and tell the younger generation, take your country back.
[02:55:46.488 --> 02:55:49.092]  But, he might still run for president.
[02:55:49.092 --> 02:55:52.016]  Noel, in Ohio, you're on the air with Tyrell Ventura.
[02:55:53.108 --> 02:55:55.849]  Alex, Tyrell, pleasure to talk to you.
[02:55:55.849 --> 02:56:16.817]  A little nervous, sorry, but I've been reading the Guerrilla News Network's book, True Lies, and you're mentioned in it, and I thought it would be a good idea for maybe a second season show to do a show on the depleted uranium that they were giving the troops as ammunition.
[02:56:16.817 --> 02:56:20.798]  That is a great subject because the Army's own manuals admit it, Tyrell.
[02:56:21.789 --> 02:56:23.489]  That's a fantastic subject.
[02:56:23.489 --> 02:56:27.570]  I just saw a piece about that the other day that was devastating.
[02:56:27.570 --> 02:56:30.851]  You know, what's happening over there from using those in weaponry and things like that.
[02:56:30.851 --> 02:56:31.851]  Why are we?
[02:56:31.851 --> 02:56:35.371]  You know, there's no reason for us to use depleted uranium in weapons.
[02:56:35.371 --> 02:56:39.792]  Well, it's a toxic waste, just like fluoride's a toxic waste, so they put it in the water.
[02:56:39.792 --> 02:56:49.174]  It's a toxic waste from spent fuel rods at nuke plants, so they put it into weaponry when the Army's own manuals in the 80s said, this will kill you deader than a hammer if you breathe it.
[02:56:49.174 --> 02:56:50.654]  Now they say, oh no, it's good for you.
[02:56:51.618 --> 02:56:55.860]  No, that's just typical.
[02:56:55.860 --> 02:57:00.462]  It's the corporation trying to get rid of its toxic waste so they figure out we can sell it to the military.
[02:57:00.462 --> 02:57:02.562]  They have good use for it.
[02:57:02.562 --> 02:57:07.224]  And then they always wrap themselves in the flag, but they could really care less about these troops.
[02:57:07.224 --> 02:57:07.904]  Oh, of course not.
[02:57:07.904 --> 02:57:08.645]  They don't care, no.
[02:57:08.645 --> 02:57:18.969]  It's sad when you see these young kids going over there, my generation and younger, going over to Iraq and they're 4th, 5th, 6th, 2nd or now, if not 8th.
[02:57:20.204 --> 02:57:22.685]  Uh, you know, being used completely as corporate pawns.
[02:57:22.685 --> 02:57:24.026]  You know, it's terrible.
[02:57:24.026 --> 02:57:26.847]  Knowles, anything else?
[02:57:26.847 --> 02:57:27.728]  Knowles gone.
[02:57:27.728 --> 02:57:30.189]  Mark in Oregon, quickly, go ahead.
[02:57:30.189 --> 02:57:31.769]  Morning, Alex and Tyrell.
[02:57:31.769 --> 02:57:39.793]  I want to congratulate you both on your very successful expose of evil here and the dark side.
[02:57:39.793 --> 02:57:43.534]  I'd like to make a quick comment and ask a question.
[02:57:45.282 --> 02:58:04.327]  I think your dad, Tyrell, and Ron Paul, interchangeably on the ticket, I don't know which would be vice president or president, but that would certainly gather in a lot of people between the independent type of voter as well as the Republican voter, and perhaps quite a few Democrats.
[02:58:04.327 --> 02:58:05.287]  Something to think about.
[02:58:05.287 --> 02:58:08.788]  At any rate, I wanted to ask you, Tyrell, do you have any knowledge of
[02:58:10.655 --> 02:58:19.280]  Turner Broadcasting, Ted Turner's conglomerate, actually having ownership or a large interest in the TruTV network.
[02:58:19.280 --> 02:58:21.862]  I've heard again... I don't have knowledge of that.
[02:58:21.862 --> 02:58:25.604]  I mean, I know that there's... Yeah, he doesn't have a controlling interest.
[02:58:25.604 --> 02:58:29.066]  He's now out of the decision-making process in those companies.
[02:58:29.066 --> 02:58:33.769]  Yeah, I think it's just called Turner Broadcasting just because that's the name of it.
[02:58:33.769 --> 02:58:37.671]  Yeah, I mean, he's been out of the decision-making process for five, six years.
[02:58:37.671 --> 02:58:38.432]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:58:38.432 --> 02:58:39.192]  It's globalist above...
[02:58:42.165 --> 02:58:45.647]  You are listening to GCN.

[03:00:04.474 --> 03:00:09.315]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:09.315 --> 03:00:10.895]  You want answers?
[03:00:10.895 --> 03:00:12.456]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:12.456 --> 03:00:16.637]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:16.637 --> 03:00:22.018]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.018 --> 03:00:31.160]  I have thought long and hard about why this show was allowed on air, how the show is from our perspective and proves the government's doing all this evil stuff,
[03:00:32.651 --> 03:00:35.813]  Because that's what Ventura found, and why is it on air?
[03:00:35.813 --> 03:00:37.914]  They know they've got to mix a little bit of this in.
[03:00:37.914 --> 03:00:39.355]  They can't just fully ignore it.
[03:00:39.355 --> 03:00:40.335]  It's gotten too big.
[03:00:40.335 --> 03:00:44.898]  Too many people know, so they put it on TruTV.
[03:00:44.898 --> 03:00:47.299]  And also, they know it's very popular, so they'll make money.
[03:00:47.299 --> 03:00:50.401]  They think so little of you, it's just right out in the open.
[03:00:50.401 --> 03:00:51.721]  But I think they've miscalculated.
[03:00:51.721 --> 03:00:53.622]  It's also titrating the dose.
[03:00:53.622 --> 03:00:55.603]  It's like people that are around cobras.
[03:00:55.603 --> 03:00:58.625]  They take small amounts of the venom until they get immune to it.
[03:00:58.625 --> 03:01:02.087]  And the elite are slowly... kind of like they've admitted world government now.
[03:01:02.799 --> 03:01:04.220]  But I think they've miscalculated.
[03:01:04.220 --> 03:01:10.482]  I mean, it's hurting them worse to ignore it all because then people say, well, why are they hiding it?
[03:01:10.482 --> 03:01:12.723]  I think they're just trying to put it right out in the open.
[03:01:12.723 --> 03:01:14.044]  Tyrell, you think that's a good assessment?
[03:01:15.382 --> 03:01:23.990]  Oh, I think it's that and also, yeah, I think that, you know, they kind of feel that, you know, we'll let them talk about this and have this little corner and, you know, they're never going to be a threat to us.
[03:01:23.990 --> 03:01:38.063]  But, yeah, the more people are talking about it, the more people are exposed to the truth, you know, that will get that ball rolling and get this, you know, take our liberty back, take our country back, you know, and stop programs like, you know, mentoring and candidate programs.
[03:01:38.777 --> 03:01:49.347]  You know, stop being pleased for our money and, you know, find out what the government has as plans, as backup plans, in case of a catastrophe on an ethic scale.
[03:01:49.347 --> 03:01:50.668]  You know, how is it going to save us?
[03:01:50.668 --> 03:01:53.010]  People ask questions of the government.
[03:01:53.010 --> 03:01:53.650]  Absolutely.
[03:01:53.650 --> 03:01:56.353]  I'm going to try to... It's a fundamental thing that we have, you know.
[03:01:56.353 --> 03:01:56.793]  Absolutely.
[03:01:56.793 --> 03:01:58.455]  I'm going to try to jam in some quick calls.
[03:01:58.455 --> 03:02:01.637]  Quick question for Tyrell Ventura.
[03:02:01.637 --> 03:02:03.119]  Rose in Montana, you're on the air.
[03:02:04.053 --> 03:02:06.874]  Hi Alex and Tyrell, first time caller.
[03:02:06.874 --> 03:02:12.677]  Alex, I want to thank you very much because without your tireless efforts, I don't think any of this would be possible.
[03:02:12.677 --> 03:02:17.679]  And for the first time in three years since I became awake, I'm starting to feel hopeful.
[03:02:17.679 --> 03:02:21.001]  Because, you know, you just keep pummeling, pummeling, pummeling people.
[03:02:21.001 --> 03:02:21.661]  Exactly!
[03:02:21.661 --> 03:02:23.462]  We now are having victory.
[03:02:23.462 --> 03:02:26.744]  Look at Copenhagen, setting up world government going down in flames.
[03:02:26.744 --> 03:02:28.505]  We're having victory on every level.
[03:02:28.505 --> 03:02:28.885]  Tyrell?
[03:02:29.993 --> 03:02:43.545]  I agree, you know, like I said, the more people talking about it, the more, you know, programs like Alex is listening to, shows like are watched, and the more you get that piece of truth out there and let people hang on to it, you know, or at least just defend a different opinion.
[03:02:43.545 --> 03:02:48.449]  And even if you don't believe anything that we're saying, at least just listen to different opinions in your life.
[03:02:48.449 --> 03:02:51.672]  Momentum is shifting towards liberty.
[03:02:51.672 --> 03:02:53.113]  Freedom is on the rise.
[03:02:53.113 --> 03:02:55.075]  Tyranny's been rising for a long time.
[03:02:55.075 --> 03:02:56.336]  Now liberty is rising.
[03:02:57.651 --> 03:02:58.932]  Thank you very much for that.
[03:02:58.932 --> 03:03:04.035]  Because without your tireless efforts and those who have followed you, this would not be possible.
[03:03:04.035 --> 03:03:07.597]  And today was, yesterday was the first day that I felt really hopeful.
[03:03:07.597 --> 03:03:17.623]  When, you know, your program on what was going on with TARP and AIG and European media bursting loose on H1N1.
[03:03:17.623 --> 03:03:24.747]  Okay, and I thank you so much because I don't think TruTV would be possible without your work.
[03:03:24.747 --> 03:03:25.828]  That's right.
[03:03:25.828 --> 03:03:27.069]  The head of the EU
[03:03:28.389 --> 03:03:35.135]  Uh, Health Council has said it was all a fraud, dangerous vaccine to make money.
[03:03:35.135 --> 03:03:37.818]  Again, we've been purely vindicated.
[03:03:37.818 --> 03:03:40.040]  Tyrell, so much is coming out now.
[03:03:40.040 --> 03:03:42.462]  The government's being just absolutely discredited.
[03:03:43.872 --> 03:03:44.753]  Oh, yeah.
[03:03:44.753 --> 03:03:53.222]  I mean, you can find the truth in every news article they put out illustrating their end or what they want you to believe.
[03:03:53.222 --> 03:03:55.104]  You can find an alternate viewpoint.
[03:03:55.104 --> 03:04:01.230]  And like I said, even if you don't believe every alternate viewpoint you come across, you have to leave yourself open.
[03:04:01.230 --> 03:04:02.892]  It shouldn't just be a right or left debate.
[03:04:04.193 --> 03:04:06.554]  You know, you can't just be spoon-fed your whole life.
[03:04:06.554 --> 03:04:09.176]  It's okay to be a free thinker, even if you're proven wrong.
[03:04:09.176 --> 03:04:18.481]  You can have a great theory or a great, you know, good like we've tracked down many conspiracies that ended up being dead ends, or facts ended up being untrue, so we had to move in a different direction.
[03:04:18.481 --> 03:04:26.925]  But that's the nature of investigations, the nature of good public discourse, you know, is being able to have all sorts of viewpoints presented.
[03:04:27.495 --> 03:04:39.402]  Well said Tyrell Ventura, great job on the show and I want to be clear, it's you the audience, it's you the people getting the word out at the grassroots that deserve all the credit for the awakening that's happening.
[03:04:39.402 --> 03:04:44.606]  I'm only a small part of that, Tyrell's a small part, Ventura's a small part, but all of us together
[03:04:45.226 --> 03:04:45.626]  Take care, Alex.
[03:05:01.072 --> 03:05:04.074]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.074 --> 03:05:09.419]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.419 --> 03:05:11.460]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:11.460 --> 03:05:16.464]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:16.464 --> 03:05:17.365]  How much do you want?
[03:05:17.625 --> 03:05:18.766]  When do you want it?
[03:05:18.766 --> 03:05:20.647]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:20.647 --> 03:05:21.727]  When will you need it?
[03:05:21.727 --> 03:05:23.928]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:23.928 --> 03:05:25.269]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.269 --> 03:05:26.790]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:26.790 --> 03:05:32.053]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.053 --> 03:05:35.635]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:35.635 --> 03:05:39.117]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:39.457 --> 03:05:40.678]  How much will you need?
[03:05:40.678 --> 03:05:41.580]  We don't know.
[03:05:41.580 --> 03:05:42.681]  How much do you want?
[03:05:42.681 --> 03:05:43.622]  All you can get.
[03:05:43.622 --> 03:05:44.723]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:44.723 --> 03:05:47.767]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:47.767 --> 03:05:49.549]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:49.549 --> 03:05:50.470]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.441 --> 03:06:01.602]  What's your home worth?
[03:06:01.602 --> 03:06:03.705]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[03:06:03.705 --> 03:06:06.749]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[03:06:06.749 --> 03:06:14.459]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[03:06:14.459 --> 03:06:17.923]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[03:06:31.879 --> 03:06:33.020]  View comparable homes.
[03:06:33.240 --> 03:06:33.620]  I think so.
[03:07:00.663 --> 03:07:04.245]  America is in deep, deep trouble because we don't know our rights.
[03:07:04.245 --> 03:07:10.709]  Let's get real freedom back into America by teaching and promoting the Bill of Rights with the 2010 Freedom Calendar.
[03:07:10.709 --> 03:07:11.170]  Why?
[03:07:11.170 --> 03:07:13.211]  Because our forefathers gave them to us.
[03:07:13.211 --> 03:07:16.513]  Because the Freedom Calendar is true patriotism in action.
[03:07:16.513 --> 03:07:20.936]  And because if you don't know your rights and use them, you may lose them.
[03:07:20.936 --> 03:07:24.618]  The Freedom Calendar is the best educational tool in over 200 years.
[03:07:24.618 --> 03:07:29.241]  It shows in detail how to use your rights, how to answer any bureaucrat, how to use your guaranteed rights
[03:07:29.561 --> 03:07:38.605]  The Freedom Calendar is the easy way to learn the proper use and function of each of our rights, and is perfect for homeschoolers, business promotions and fundraisers.

[03:07:44.468 --> 03:07:45.228]  The Freedom Calendar.
[03:07:45.228 --> 03:07:46.309]  Know your rights, or lose them.
[03:07:54.312 --> 03:07:56.134]  Order now while supplies last.
[03:07:56.134 --> 03:07:56.795]  Call 651-771-5234 today.
[03:07:56.795 --> 03:07:58.096]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:07:58.096 --> 03:07:59.578]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:11.814 --> 03:08:15.317]  She's a member of Iceland's parliament.
[03:08:15.317 --> 03:08:17.758]  She's also the chairman of her party.
[03:08:17.758 --> 03:08:21.040]  She's been involved in Friends of Tibet.
[03:08:21.040 --> 03:08:24.102]  She's been involved all over the world fighting tyranny.
[03:08:24.102 --> 03:08:26.303]  Her bio is lengthy.
[03:08:26.303 --> 03:08:28.525]  Her name is Birgitta Jones-Dottir.
[03:08:29.565 --> 03:08:37.607]  We're Daughter of Jones, and we are very honored to have her joining us via video Skype from the capital of Iceland.
[03:08:37.607 --> 03:08:43.868]  She is with us for the next 52 minutes, and we really appreciate her coming on in her busy schedule.
[03:08:43.868 --> 03:08:47.629]  We'll give you the party's website and a lot more information.
[03:08:47.629 --> 03:08:49.269]  Here is the London Guardian.
[03:08:49.269 --> 03:08:54.830]  Britain's anti-terror laws being deployed for all sorts of ends, as Iceland has just discovered.
[03:08:54.830 --> 03:08:58.531]  They declared the country basically terrorist, stole many of their bank accounts.
[03:09:00.012 --> 03:09:07.997]  They want the country to pay private debts for derivatives to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of England and others.
[03:09:07.997 --> 03:09:12.720]  And the country, just like third world nations have been taken over, is being taken over by offshore banks.
[03:09:12.720 --> 03:09:14.701]  The people are saying no.
[03:09:14.701 --> 03:09:20.184]  Now the banks are backing off saying, well maybe we had assets we didn't tell you about and you don't owe that much.
[03:09:20.184 --> 03:09:21.065]  It's all made up.
[03:09:21.565 --> 03:09:27.630]  If they can win their fight there, it will send a domino effect throughout Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, the United States.
[03:09:27.630 --> 03:09:30.052]  This debt is created through fraud.
[03:09:30.052 --> 03:09:41.141]  We also have Bankstergate with Tim Geithner, open discussions of him being indicted for fraud, getting money for himself and others out of bailout money, and ordering the government to cover that up at AIG.
[03:09:41.861 --> 03:09:45.262]  And so we'll get her take on BanksterGate as well.
[03:09:45.262 --> 03:09:51.083]  But we are very honored to have Birgitta Jones-Dottier on with us.
[03:09:51.083 --> 03:09:53.464]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[03:09:53.464 --> 03:09:55.604]  Well, thanks for having me.
[03:09:55.604 --> 03:09:58.885]  However, I have to correct one thing about the banks.
[03:09:58.885 --> 03:10:05.046]  The bank that we are supposed to be covering was a privately run bank by Icelanders.
[03:10:05.046 --> 03:10:06.987]  But it made the investments in the derivatives.
[03:10:07.702 --> 03:10:09.564]  Yes, of course.
[03:10:09.564 --> 03:10:11.526]  So we were basically conned.
[03:10:11.526 --> 03:10:13.568]  The entire nation was conned.
[03:10:13.568 --> 03:10:21.536]  And the thing is that the Brits and the Dutch, they want us to pay back with huge interest.
[03:10:21.536 --> 03:10:25.580]  So they're actually making money off us, money that never reached Iceland.
[03:10:25.580 --> 03:10:29.604]  And most Icelanders had never heard of these accounts before everything collapsed.
[03:10:30.433 --> 03:10:39.758]  And they put the terrorist law on us, almost like guinea pigs, because they had not tried to use that particular Terror Act law.
[03:10:39.758 --> 03:10:45.461]  And instead of putting it on the bank in the beginning, which was privately owned, they put it on Iceland.
[03:10:45.461 --> 03:10:59.049]  And actually, during our incredible system, almost the entire system collapsed, when all the big banks collapsed, they decided to put the Terrorist Act on us, so we were very close to not having food in Iceland.
[03:11:00.100 --> 03:11:00.620]  Amazing.
[03:11:00.620 --> 03:11:21.407]  Now, start at the beginning, for people that don't understand what's happening and why this is so important globally, with what happened in Iceland, the chain of events, and now the incredible fight you and others are leading against the banking cartel, literally turning your country into a vassal state through economic fraudulent conquest.
[03:11:22.785 --> 03:11:25.048]  Well, it all happened a few years ago.
[03:11:25.048 --> 03:11:29.492]  All the big banks were actually government-owned, or the people owned them.
[03:11:29.492 --> 03:11:40.384]  And we had a conservative party run Iceland for 18 years, and during that period they basically privatized everything the people owned, including the banks, a few years ago.
[03:11:40.384 --> 03:11:44.649]  And they sold the banks relatively cheaply to friends and allies.
[03:11:46.053 --> 03:11:50.696]  And they made, in a very short period of time, all the legislation vanish.
[03:11:50.696 --> 03:11:55.358]  That would have them, you know, having to not expand as quickly as they did.
[03:11:55.358 --> 03:12:00.461]  They became five times bigger than the annual GDP.
[03:12:00.461 --> 03:12:07.725]  And so when they collapsed, you can imagine how huge blow it was for the nation.
[03:12:07.725 --> 03:12:08.846]  Now today,
[03:12:10.663 --> 03:12:22.447]  In Iceland, there's been, what, almost a year of protest and people taking over government buildings and saying no, and a key vote is coming up by the people of Iceland on whether or not you're going to capitulate to this fraud.
[03:12:22.447 --> 03:12:23.527]  Can you walk us through that?
[03:12:23.527 --> 03:12:25.888]  Yes.
[03:12:25.888 --> 03:12:31.470]  Just around the time when, you know, the banking system collapsed, protests started.
[03:12:31.470 --> 03:12:32.770]  People were actually quite shocked.
[03:12:33.545 --> 03:12:36.166]  Because they had been conned.
[03:12:36.166 --> 03:12:43.207]  And we wanted to get the government out of office, which is impossible by legislation.
[03:12:43.207 --> 03:12:46.628]  So we had the soft revolution driving the government away.
[03:12:46.628 --> 03:13:02.431]  And then when we got a new government, which apparently is just like the old one, unfortunately, with all their secrecy and bowing to the IMF, which, you know, I really think that we need to get a plan B to get rid of.
[03:13:04.848 --> 03:13:19.643]  There's been an ongoing protest and it's growing bigger and bigger again because people are very unhappy with the way the new government is handling things, even though it is the first left-wing government in the history of Iceland.
[03:13:19.643 --> 03:13:26.009]  Because you can't run left-wing politics with the IMF controlling the national budget.
[03:13:27.470 --> 03:13:30.291]  And we've been, you know, in the Parliament.
[03:13:30.291 --> 03:13:32.451]  I just got fresh into Parliament.
[03:13:32.451 --> 03:13:35.252]  You know, I'm not really a politician by heart.
[03:13:35.252 --> 03:13:42.613]  And our movement, we were created out of all the different grassroots that popped up after the collapse.
[03:13:42.613 --> 03:13:46.594]  And we got, just in eight weeks, more than 7% of the vote.
[03:13:46.594 --> 03:13:50.255]  And we didn't have any money, no big money people behind us.
[03:13:50.255 --> 03:13:56.816]  Just a relentless effort of ordinary people who wanted to build a bridge between Parliament and the people.
[03:13:58.791 --> 03:14:04.515]  So, you know, when we got into Parliament, the Iceland dilemma landed in our lap.
[03:14:04.515 --> 03:14:19.965]  And we found out that they wanted to pass this huge burden on the nation without even the parliamentarians seeing the contract between Iceland and the Dutch and the British government.
[03:14:19.965 --> 03:14:22.166]  So the fight started there.
[03:14:22.166 --> 03:14:25.889]  And fortunately, the contract was leaked.
[03:14:26.661 --> 03:14:39.252]  And that has been a great blessing for us that so much of the material they wanted to hide from us and the nation has been leaked on sites like Wikileaks and into the media in Iceland.
[03:14:39.252 --> 03:14:51.083]  However, we passed, we managed to change the contract this summer, which was actually a totally unique and a new way also for other nations that are suffering from
[03:14:51.952 --> 03:14:58.515]  You know, spending all their national budget, all their GDP on dispaying interest of foreign debt.
[03:14:58.515 --> 03:15:06.860]  So in the changes on the bill, we managed to put in that we would never pay more than we could handle.
[03:15:06.860 --> 03:15:16.825]  And of course, the British and the Dutch did not like that, and they demanded that we would actually change Icelandic law in order for them to accept it.
[03:15:17.714 --> 03:15:21.436]  And our government decided to listen to them.
[03:15:21.436 --> 03:15:23.337]  Unbelievable.
[03:15:23.337 --> 03:15:26.598]  They pushed another bill through.
[03:15:26.598 --> 03:15:32.781]  There was a question if they would actually manage to get majority vote or not.
[03:15:32.781 --> 03:15:46.768]  And when they passed it during that time, which was by force, the nation got up to its feet and 23% of the nation signed the petition asking the president of Iceland
[03:15:47.521 --> 03:15:53.407]  Who is the last person to sign all law to not sign this law and let the nation vote on it?
[03:15:53.407 --> 03:16:02.695]  So this is the first time in Icelandic history since we voted on becoming a sovereign state when we got out of the Danish colonialism in 1944.
[03:16:02.695 --> 03:16:08.881]  So it's truly historical and I really hope that we will have the courage to vote no to this.
[03:16:09.508 --> 03:16:12.069]  Out of courage, but not, yes, out of fear.
[03:16:12.069 --> 03:16:14.250]  Because of course there is a great spin.
[03:16:14.250 --> 03:16:22.815]  And that is why it is so important for the Icelandic people to feel the support of the people of the world who are fed up with bailing out the bankers.
[03:16:22.815 --> 03:16:28.938]  We're talking to Birgitta Jones-Dottir, a member of the Icelandic Parliament.
[03:16:29.494 --> 03:16:39.099]  She is also the chairman of her new party that is rising to power there, as people see that they're actually standing up for the population, against fraud.
[03:16:39.099 --> 03:16:43.081]  The population has been on the edge of near revolt.
[03:16:43.081 --> 03:16:52.785]  We've played those videos here of people taking over banks, government buildings, you know, mainline, families, middle class, wealthy people, working class.
[03:16:52.785 --> 03:16:57.207]  Because literally, the country was imploded by design.
[03:16:57.207 --> 03:16:58.548]  Food wasn't even coming in.
[03:16:59.494 --> 03:17:03.436]  They export and import in a lot of their food.
[03:17:03.436 --> 03:17:05.117]  Just absolutely hellish.
[03:17:05.117 --> 03:17:14.402]  So I want to go over the fact that some news reports have said five times your GDP that the bank went into with derivative scams.
[03:17:14.402 --> 03:17:16.523]  Some have said ten times GDP.
[03:17:16.523 --> 03:17:19.404]  You're saying five times GDP.
[03:17:19.404 --> 03:17:22.946]  And I mean the actual bondage, the financial enslavement
[03:17:23.406 --> 03:17:23.626]  Well, um...
[03:17:53.268 --> 03:18:03.674]  What the previous government managed to do was to create a law that allowed the banks to maintain complete secrecy of, like, you know, their loan books and so forth.
[03:18:04.526 --> 03:18:25.542]  Even if now all the banks, especially the bank that controls the ISAV accounts, is now, you know, taken over by the government, we, the parliamentarians can't, and not even the Minister of Finance has seen what is supposed to be the bond or the assets that are supposed to cover ISAV.
[03:18:25.542 --> 03:18:29.945]  And I have asked for it from day one since last summer, officially,
[03:18:30.749 --> 03:18:40.377]  And unofficially, and they just stayed within the state, the liquidity committees.
[03:18:40.377 --> 03:18:47.423]  However, I think people are awakening to the fact they're starting to demand more, which they didn't.
[03:18:47.423 --> 03:18:51.486]  And I think one of the good things about this difficult situation
[03:18:52.455 --> 03:18:55.276]  Which means, you know, there's a lot of people moving away from Iceland.
[03:18:55.276 --> 03:18:59.578]  There's a wave of... There's a huge brain drain already happening.
[03:18:59.578 --> 03:19:04.219]  And we used to be the fifth richest nation in the world.
[03:19:04.219 --> 03:19:12.482]  And now we're ranked among the fourth most likely nation to go bankrupt or go into debt moratorium.
[03:19:12.482 --> 03:19:17.704]  And, you know, we had very little poverty here and there was a very little gap between the rich and poor.
[03:19:18.596 --> 03:19:26.979]  However, that all changed with the new billionaires that basically got everything given on a silver platter.
[03:19:26.979 --> 03:19:34.743]  And are now responsible for the reason why we're here, but their assets have not been frozen yet.
[03:19:34.743 --> 03:19:35.723]  Birgitta, stay there.
[03:19:35.723 --> 03:19:38.204]  We're going to come right back to you after this break.
[03:19:38.204 --> 03:19:39.225]  But this is the story.
[03:19:39.225 --> 03:19:43.486]  This is what the IMF, the World Bank, does in countries all over the world.
[03:19:43.486 --> 03:19:45.047]  They're done destroying the third world.
[03:19:45.956 --> 03:19:56.188]  They're now moving in to loot the first world, one of the most wealthy nations on earth, overnight becoming poor, and they're saying, no, this debt is a fraud.
[03:19:56.188 --> 03:19:57.369]  This is a scam.
[03:19:57.369 --> 03:19:58.891]  You bankers ran off with the money.
[03:19:58.891 --> 03:20:00.873]  We don't owe you more money.
[03:20:00.873 --> 03:20:04.818]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:20:05.879 --> 03:20:09.122]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:20:09.122 --> 03:20:09.923]  It's very real.
[03:20:09.923 --> 03:20:12.165]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:20:12.165 --> 03:20:13.827]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:20:13.827 --> 03:20:18.291]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with a Cola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[03:20:18.291 --> 03:20:20.874]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.

[03:20:26.880 --> 03:20:31.663]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[03:20:31.663 --> 03:20:34.504]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[03:20:34.504 --> 03:20:37.205]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[03:20:37.205 --> 03:20:44.669]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[03:20:48.411 --> 03:20:48.631]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[03:21:00.716 --> 03:21:07.038]  Did you know that the dollar has lost 10% of its value against other currencies in the last 90 days?
[03:21:07.038 --> 03:21:11.979]  Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?
[03:21:11.979 --> 03:21:16.060]  Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?
[03:21:16.060 --> 03:21:17.401]  Let's put this another way.
[03:21:17.401 --> 03:21:22.522]  Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[03:21:22.742 --> 03:21:25.644]  Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.
[03:21:25.644 --> 03:21:28.305]  Gold does not require trust in a third party.
[03:21:28.305 --> 03:21:30.026]  You can possess it in your hand.
[03:21:30.026 --> 03:21:31.287]  You can take it with you.
[03:21:31.287 --> 03:21:32.768]  Gold is real money.
[03:21:32.768 --> 03:21:34.129]  Gold is honest money.
[03:21:34.129 --> 03:21:36.850]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.
[03:21:36.850 --> 03:21:43.954]  To find out how you can protect your savings and roll over your IRA funds into precious metal accounts, call me at 800-686-2237 extension 134.
[03:21:43.954 --> 03:21:44.194]  That's 800-686-2237
[03:21:52.319 --> 03:21:55.280]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:55.280 --> 03:21:57.561]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:57.561 --> 03:21:59.162]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:22:11.511 --> 03:22:14.172]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:14.172 --> 03:22:20.553]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:20.553 --> 03:22:25.754]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:25.754 --> 03:22:29.015]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:22:29.015 --> 03:22:35.736]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:35.856 --> 03:22:38.198]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:38.198 --> 03:22:39.800]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:39.800 --> 03:22:42.262]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:42.262 --> 03:22:44.384]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:44.384 --> 03:22:49.529]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:49.529 --> 03:22:54.553]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:22:54.553 --> 03:22:58.657]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:23:00.580 --> 03:23:05.127]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:23:05.127 --> 03:23:09.473]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:23:09.473 --> 03:23:14.440]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to
[03:23:16.869 --> 03:23:17.249]  We're good to go!
[03:23:46.363 --> 03:23:50.546]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:23:50.546 --> 03:23:52.328]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:23:52.328 --> 03:23:54.589]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[03:23:57.191 --> 03:24:14.925]  Birgitta Jones-Dottir, member of the Icelandic Parliament, leading the charge against the banker Takeover,
[03:24:16.625 --> 03:24:22.867]  Americans are losing their jobs or having their pay cut, their savings are being destroyed.
[03:24:22.867 --> 03:24:29.728]  We're going through the same process as Main Street dies, as everything is fed into the big banks.
[03:24:29.728 --> 03:24:33.049]  But they tell Americans, oh, we've got a great economy!
[03:24:33.049 --> 03:24:36.070]  So we're in the same boat as Iceland.
[03:24:36.070 --> 03:24:39.751]  Going back to our guest, Birgitta, looking at this,
[03:24:41.317 --> 03:24:42.198]  Well, I guess the con started
[03:25:02.775 --> 03:25:11.540]  Relatively sneakily, you know, because they were sort of passing loans between the banks with nothing really behind it.
[03:25:11.540 --> 03:25:15.523]  They were making all these fancy bundles and stuff like that.
[03:25:15.523 --> 03:25:18.444]  And I honestly don't have the English terms for it.
[03:25:20.146 --> 03:25:35.812]  But then in the end, when they were truly becoming desperate for cash, they started to call on elderly people and immigrants, asking them to move their savings to high-risk accounts, saying that there were no risk accounts.
[03:25:35.812 --> 03:25:45.456]  And telling them that, you know, even though it had better interest, it would be still completely safe for them to save the money there.
[03:25:45.456 --> 03:25:47.757]  And then they basically rinsed out all that money
[03:25:48.582 --> 03:25:57.264]  Into God knows what, probably it's all resting in Tortola Islands or something like that.
[03:25:57.264 --> 03:26:03.045]  The spin that's happening right now with the Icelandic government and the media, it's almost shocking.
[03:26:03.045 --> 03:26:15.428]  It feels like they are, you know, somehow working with the Dutch and the British in order to make us submit to their fear-mongering because
[03:26:16.349 --> 03:26:24.654]  One of the mantras they had in Parliament when they were forcing this bill through was that Iceland would become completely isolated.
[03:26:24.654 --> 03:26:29.277]  We would become Cuba of the North or Zimbabwe of the North.
[03:26:29.975 --> 03:26:32.216]  Nigeria of the North.
[03:26:32.216 --> 03:26:35.516]  And that, you know, everybody would stop doing business with us.
[03:26:35.516 --> 03:26:38.537]  We could not get loans anywhere.
[03:26:38.537 --> 03:26:40.538]  And our export would be in danger.
[03:26:40.538 --> 03:26:41.978]  Nobody would want to invest in us.
[03:26:41.978 --> 03:26:43.718]  So financial terrorism.
[03:26:43.718 --> 03:26:45.519]  We had the same thing here in October of 2008.
[03:26:45.519 --> 03:26:48.620]  They said, you will have martial law.
[03:26:48.620 --> 03:26:50.500]  You will have a collapsed economy.
[03:26:50.500 --> 03:26:52.280]  Give us unlimited power.
[03:26:52.280 --> 03:26:55.461]  And then now there's talk of criminal charges against Geithner and others.
[03:26:55.461 --> 03:26:57.162]  I mean, they're committing crimes.
[03:26:57.162 --> 03:26:58.702]  It's the same people that robbed us.
[03:26:59.202 --> 03:27:01.163]  Yeah, that's what everybody's waiting for.
[03:27:01.163 --> 03:27:07.407]  There's actually, I'm on a committee that has just been founded to go through the, there's a truth commission report coming out early next month.
[03:27:24.916 --> 03:27:30.739]  And everybody's waiting in anticipation about what is going to be in that report.
[03:27:30.739 --> 03:27:52.331]  I hope that both politicians who were sleeping or openly engaged in this scam, and allowing all the institutions to be laid down or afforded with new legislation, and the criminals that stole the money, and actually the guys that owned Lunchbunky, the iSave host,
[03:27:53.150 --> 03:27:58.393]  Uh, have been openly, you know, associated with the Russian mafia.
[03:27:58.393 --> 03:28:00.995]  So we're dealing with very big elements here.
[03:28:00.995 --> 03:28:13.322]  And that is why I think that, um, uh, the people in Iceland needs more than anything to feel that we're not alone in the world, that the people of the world more than anything are behind us.
[03:28:13.322 --> 03:28:14.723]  And I'm starting, um,
[03:28:15.669 --> 03:28:25.115]  An international petition where the only thing people need to do is just to say that they support us in this quest for freedom from this tyranny and blackmail.
[03:28:25.115 --> 03:28:37.522]  And they've also been using the EU because what the new government did was to apply for membership of the European Union, despite the fact that the majority of the nation is not willing to join it.
[03:28:38.894 --> 03:28:45.777]  And one, people have to bear in mind that even though we're very few, there are 320,000 people living on the island.
[03:28:45.777 --> 03:28:49.439]  The island is the same size as Kentucky.
[03:28:49.439 --> 03:28:52.320]  We have incredible resources.
[03:28:52.320 --> 03:28:57.363]  And we are located very strategically for warfare.
[03:28:57.363 --> 03:29:02.445]  That's why we had an American base here since the Second World War until recently.
[03:29:03.986 --> 03:29:11.675]  And since the Cold War stopped, then we became redundant as a location to the great joy of many.
[03:29:11.675 --> 03:29:21.467]  But however, the north pathway for ships to travel from Asia to this part of the world, in a much shorter and quicker way, is opening.
[03:29:24.557 --> 03:29:25.697]  All right, stay there.
[03:29:25.697 --> 03:29:26.177]  Stay there.
[03:29:26.177 --> 03:29:30.398]  Member of Parliament from Iceland leading the fight against the bankers.
[03:29:30.398 --> 03:29:33.019]  A bellwether test case.
[03:29:33.019 --> 03:29:37.520]  They're set to vote very soon on whether they're going to let the bankers continue their raping.
[03:29:37.520 --> 03:29:40.080]  The bankers are now cornered in the London Guardian reports.
[03:29:40.080 --> 03:29:41.660]  They're now saying, oh, guess what?
[03:29:41.660 --> 03:29:44.461]  You don't owe as much money as we said.
[03:29:44.461 --> 03:29:46.701]  The bank has all these assets.
[03:29:46.701 --> 03:29:49.202]  We're going to talk about that when we come back.
[03:29:49.202 --> 03:29:51.102]  Iceland is standing up.
[03:29:51.102 --> 03:29:52.503]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.503 --> 03:29:54.003]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.022 --> 03:29:57.715]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.575 --> 03:30:04.677]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:30:04.677 --> 03:30:07.538]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:30:07.538 --> 03:30:08.818]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:30:08.818 --> 03:30:09.639]  It's very real.
[03:30:09.639 --> 03:30:11.880]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:30:11.880 --> 03:30:13.520]  And it's available right now to you.

[03:31:11.898 --> 03:31:14.381]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:31:14.381 --> 03:31:20.767]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:20.767 --> 03:31:25.831]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:25.831 --> 03:31:35.941]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.

[03:31:40.003 --> 03:31:42.444]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:42.444 --> 03:31:44.565]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:44.565 --> 03:31:49.727]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:34:58.409 --> 03:35:07.851]  I want to open the phones up for our guests specifically on BankerGate.
[03:35:07.851 --> 03:35:20.534]  If you specifically have questions for our guests on what's happening in Iceland, what's happening in Europe, what's happening here in the US, on how they stood up to the bankers, how they're starting to defeat them.
[03:35:21.201 --> 03:35:25.807]  The total free number to join us today on this Wednesday, the 13th day of January 2010 is 1-800-259-9231.
[03:35:25.807 --> 03:35:25.927]  800-259-9231.
[03:35:25.927 --> 03:35:30.312]  And joining us via video Skype from the capital of Iceland is the Member of Parliament and the Chairman of her party,
[03:35:40.744 --> 03:35:47.594]  Uh, that is, uh, really getting more and more seats and more and more popularity, uh, as the people stand up and find their legs against the bankers.
[03:35:47.594 --> 03:35:51.960]  Uh, Birgitta Jones, Dr. Yeager, again, is our guest.
[03:35:51.960 --> 03:35:54.063]  Uh, as we went to break, I was asking the question,
[03:35:55.000 --> 03:36:14.094]  For people that just joined us, now that it looks like Iceland's gonna vote against paying this fraudulent debt to the bankers that have already robbed you, they just want more now, now they go, oh, suddenly we found all these assets in the bank, looks like you don't owe us, even though it's fraudulent, owe us as much as we thought, so now they're backing off going, okay,
[03:36:14.714 --> 03:36:25.098]  We won't destroy you, we won't embargo you, we won't put blockades up, we won't destroy your nation after we already robbed it, if you just pay us a third of what we wanted.
[03:36:25.098 --> 03:36:31.100]  So again, we're showing that these guys are paper tigers, straw men, if you'll just stand up and fight them.
[03:36:31.100 --> 03:36:36.862]  And leading that fight, we are so honored to have you, and we salute you because we're all in this fight together.
[03:36:36.862 --> 03:36:37.542]  Please continue.
[03:36:39.142 --> 03:36:46.945]  Okay, I just want to clarify one thing, that the people that are really leading this fight are the people of Iceland.
[03:36:46.945 --> 03:36:47.285]  Yes.
[03:36:47.285 --> 03:37:01.351]  Yeah, but I mean, you come up in all the major newspapers around the world, and of anybody, you really are the figurehead, and a quite well-spoken one as well.
[03:37:01.351 --> 03:37:03.992]  So, I mean, it's your face there on the front of the ship.
[03:37:05.743 --> 03:37:07.603]  Well, in some aspects.
[03:37:07.603 --> 03:37:15.185]  But, however, it's been a lot of people working on this, and so I don't want to take all the credit for it.
[03:37:15.185 --> 03:37:29.448]  One thing that we should also bear in mind when it comes to the Icelandic SARA, the ISAF SARA and the entire collapse, is that I actually met with John Perkins last year, just before I got elected into Parliament.
[03:37:29.448 --> 03:37:33.529]  And I asked him, you know, what should we do to get rid of the IMF?
[03:37:34.606 --> 03:37:40.534]  And he told me that he was the most important thing we could do.
[03:37:40.534 --> 03:37:47.182]  And I think the same applies to you in the States and all over the world is that you are the creator of your reality.
[03:37:47.182 --> 03:37:50.546]  And if you want changes, you are going to have to do something.
[03:37:50.546 --> 03:37:50.807]  Okay.
[03:37:51.863 --> 03:37:56.247]  And, you know, obviously we were hit by an economic hitman.
[03:37:56.247 --> 03:38:00.591]  I don't know who it is, or if there were many, but it is blatantly obvious.
[03:38:00.591 --> 03:38:16.364]  And it was very interesting how Iceland, when we were actually doing really well, they decided to go into the biggest construction, constructing a huge dam in order to give Alcoa dirt-cheap energy that nobody knows the price of.
[03:38:16.364 --> 03:38:20.147]  And that's one of the battles, is just to find out how cheap they're getting the energy.
[03:38:21.168 --> 03:38:32.433]  And the policy of the government that was previously, and the government that was previous to that, was basically to sell Iceland's energy dirt cheap.
[03:38:32.433 --> 03:38:34.915]  They were basically pimping Iceland.
[03:38:34.915 --> 03:38:50.382]  If you were reading, if you would read some of the proposals on getting all the aluminum smelters into Iceland, which is, by the way, one of the last pristine nature in Europe, you would be shocked.
[03:38:51.241 --> 03:39:15.186]  So there are many aspects to this saga and we're just in the beginning of understanding how deep it goes and it will be very interesting to see who are the corrupt people and if the nation has the guts to have them punished in one way or another for how they have sold out our country.
[03:39:16.241 --> 03:39:22.070]  And the interesting thing as well is that when the British decided to use the Terrorist Act on Iceland,
[03:39:23.594 --> 03:39:26.675]  Very similar to how, you know, the Chinese took over Tibet.
[03:39:26.675 --> 03:39:28.556]  The Tibetans didn't have any army.
[03:39:28.556 --> 03:39:32.297]  They had a few people with guns that were hunters.
[03:39:32.297 --> 03:39:37.039]  Icelanders don't have any army or military and our cops don't even carry guns.
[03:39:37.039 --> 03:39:47.482]  So, you know, it's probably the least threatening nation in the world to being passed on side by side to Al-Qaeda and Zimbabwe and North Korea.
[03:39:48.934 --> 03:39:57.224]  So, but the thing, the lesson to be learned for the rest of the people in the world is that we are the first one to be hit.
[03:39:57.224 --> 03:39:58.065]  You could be next.
[03:40:01.753 --> 03:40:03.233]  Absolutely.
[03:40:03.233 --> 03:40:10.035]  The establishment is now moving on to gobbling up First World nations.
[03:40:10.035 --> 03:40:14.216]  They're doing the same process here.
[03:40:14.216 --> 03:40:26.298]  So this key vote coming up, I mean, is Iceland going to be able to not just stop the bankers from robbing you, but actually arrest some of these criminals or at least put arrest warrants out for them and signify that
[03:40:27.853 --> 03:40:28.754]  They are the bad guys?
[03:40:28.754 --> 03:40:35.318]  I mean, that will destroy them in the PR war if they're rightfully indicted for fraud.
[03:40:35.318 --> 03:40:40.561]  Yeah, like some of them actually still hold the media, the main media, and they're still allowed to own it.
[03:40:40.561 --> 03:40:42.702]  It's unbelievable.
[03:40:42.702 --> 03:40:49.426]  But I think that we will have another, I mean, there is a huge wave of anger brewing again among the nation.
[03:40:49.426 --> 03:40:57.451]  And if the president would not have allowed us to give us this responsibility of voting on this particular bill,
[03:40:58.772 --> 03:41:03.575]  There would have been another revolution and this time I fear it would have been more violent.
[03:41:03.575 --> 03:41:06.977]  The other one was relatively soft.
[03:41:06.977 --> 03:41:27.169]  But if the bankers and the people that are responsible for where we are at now are not going to get punished and put into jail or, you know, I would like to see them expelled from Iceland forever and ever, then we will have another revolution on our hands.
[03:41:28.587 --> 03:41:39.154]  Well, I mean, what do you call people in thousands of demonstrations, hundreds, every day, taking over government buildings, protesting in the streets, saying no, no, no?
[03:41:39.154 --> 03:41:47.020]  I've seen polls in Iceland where the vast majority are upset and saying they're not going to be part of it.
[03:41:47.020 --> 03:41:48.301]  Can you give us some of those numbers?
[03:41:49.784 --> 03:42:00.968]  Well, when we started protesting, you know, I come from that sort of grassroots level where I've organized protests and been part of protests for a long time in Iceland.
[03:42:00.968 --> 03:42:03.529]  We were just a handful of us in the beginning.
[03:42:03.529 --> 03:42:05.790]  There were actually more foreign media than us.
[03:42:05.790 --> 03:42:09.111]  However, it gradually grew into thousands of people.
[03:42:10.371 --> 03:42:21.156]  And because the numbers you would get in the Icelandic media would be always according to what the police estimated, because the media couldn't bother to go and count it.
[03:42:21.156 --> 03:42:29.680]  We only got accurate numbers when the foreign media came and counted the protesters and it was thousands and thousands of people in some of the big protests.
[03:42:32.151 --> 03:42:49.229]  And then when we had the, you know, the soft revolution that in the end drove the government away, I don't know, there were people protesting day and night and it was in the middle of winter here, it was really cold.
[03:42:49.229 --> 03:42:54.114]  I had a friend that got pneumonia from standing outside and they were doing this
[03:42:56.161 --> 03:43:03.265]  Uh, they, you know, they got all these drummers and all these people that were banging on pots and pans and it was sort of similar to the revolution in Argentina.
[03:43:03.265 --> 03:43:07.266]  Uh, the pots and pans revolution and that is what it was called in Iceland.
[03:43:07.266 --> 03:43:14.110]  It was extremely noisy and it was driving the people in the Parliament crazy.
[03:43:15.350 --> 03:43:18.312]  So maybe it was the noise that got them to resign.
[03:43:18.312 --> 03:43:18.813]  I don't know.
[03:43:18.813 --> 03:43:21.174]  But it was getting quite violent.
[03:43:21.174 --> 03:43:27.037]  There was a huge Christmas tree outside Parliament that the Norwegians always give us every Christmas.
[03:43:27.037 --> 03:43:29.439]  And they took that and burned it down.
[03:43:29.439 --> 03:43:34.302]  This sort of protest had not been happening in Iceland since we joined NATO.
[03:43:34.302 --> 03:43:39.365]  Yeah, when the people started burning stuff down, the government started backing off.
[03:43:39.365 --> 03:43:41.006]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:43:41.006 --> 03:43:42.787]  And also the police was attacked.
[03:43:45.007 --> 03:43:47.468]  They actually didn't have enough mace.
[03:43:47.468 --> 03:43:50.369]  They were running out of mace, so they started to use tear gas.
[03:43:50.369 --> 03:43:58.631]  And the moral is, when people actually finally get mad and take action, nothing, no amount of SWAT teams, no amount of garbage can stop them.
[03:43:58.631 --> 03:44:01.652]  And people always forget, in revolution, the power of fire.
[03:44:01.652 --> 03:44:05.693]  And I'm not saying that's something that needs to go on here, but I mean, look.
[03:44:06.443 --> 03:44:10.728]  A true revolutionary force cannot be stopped when it's got right on its side.
[03:44:10.728 --> 03:44:12.731]  And so now they're backing off.
[03:44:12.731 --> 03:44:16.014]  Also, people took over some buildings too, didn't they?
[03:44:16.014 --> 03:44:18.698]  Well, they did not take over the Parliament or anything like that.
[03:44:18.698 --> 03:44:23.023]  They did get into the National Treasury, but they didn't take it over.
[03:44:23.023 --> 03:44:24.044]  They were just inside?
[03:44:24.699 --> 03:44:27.341]  Yes, I'm just inside.
[03:44:27.341 --> 03:44:42.715]  I guess the media spun it and called it a takeover just like for months they wouldn't even show your protest or they'd show the corner of a small group and say these five people are out here and then if they would have panned the camera which YouTube showed tens of thousands that's how they minimize that.
[03:44:42.715 --> 03:44:50.602]  We've had events here in Austin with two three thousand people the news will come shoot the back of the crowd or a corner and only show five or six people.
[03:44:51.280 --> 03:44:52.522]  Yeah, that's so typical.
[03:44:52.522 --> 03:45:02.962]  And I've actually, you know, been following what's going on in the States and seeing that, you know, the news that are not really broadcasted in the main media and
[03:45:04.443 --> 03:45:06.704]  It's an entirely different situation.
[03:45:06.704 --> 03:45:11.487]  I mean, there are pretty grim things happening in the states right now.
[03:45:11.487 --> 03:45:22.172]  Exactly, and they're trying to make the opposition right-wing, controlled by Glenn Beck and the Republicans, so that they can get back into power and continue the fraud, just like Obama continued the fraud.
[03:45:22.172 --> 03:45:25.994]  But the truth is, the Tea Parties are really libertarian and grassroots.
[03:45:26.860 --> 03:45:37.828]  Yeah, I've been actually following them because we're also working on this level that we think left and right is redundant and that what we really need to focus on are the issues and our causes.
[03:45:37.828 --> 03:45:43.812]  And our movement, for example, does not define itself as left or right.
[03:45:43.812 --> 03:45:50.096]  Our main objective is to bring more power to the people or the power that they rightfully own back to them.
[03:45:50.675 --> 03:45:51.696]  So what's going to happen?
[03:45:51.696 --> 03:45:52.517]  What's going to happen?
[03:45:52.517 --> 03:45:59.663]  I mean, I know you can't tell the future, but right now the banks are starting to back off and saying, okay, you don't owe us as much money.
[03:45:59.663 --> 03:46:03.387]  Uh, I mean, they should go to jail, much less not.
[03:46:03.387 --> 03:46:06.910]  Well, the thing is not really in the hands of the bank, uh, banks anymore.
[03:46:06.910 --> 03:46:10.994]  It is in the hands of the British and the Dutch and the Icelandic governments.
[03:46:10.994 --> 03:46:12.095]  And that is the big problem.
[03:46:12.095 --> 03:46:12.295]  It is
[03:46:12.915 --> 03:46:15.998]  Well, why can't your Parliament march in and take over the Treasury?
[03:46:15.998 --> 03:46:22.383]  No, I know, but I'm saying not let... I mean, you're saying the bureaucracy is still making the decisions, but you're the boss.
[03:46:22.383 --> 03:46:23.344]  You're the people's representative.
[03:46:37.574 --> 03:46:44.418]  Well, the thing is, you know, the petition and the fact that we get to vote on it, I really hope that they will not take that away from us.
[03:46:44.418 --> 03:46:49.462]  They can take the voting from us by pulling back the bill.
[03:46:49.462 --> 03:47:04.911]  But I really think it is extremely important that we have this national referendum because it will set an example for that the people can, again, call for national referendum if a certain percentage of the nation calls for it.
[03:47:04.911 --> 03:47:05.992]  And that's coming up soon?
[03:47:07.287 --> 03:47:12.850]  Yes, it's set for around 27th of February.
[03:47:12.850 --> 03:47:14.991]  So we'll see what happens in the meantime.
[03:47:14.991 --> 03:47:23.315]  I'm part of, since I'm acting chairman right now for the movement, I get to go to all the heads of state meetings and so forth.
[03:47:23.315 --> 03:47:34.061]  And we're trying to form a sort of a joint approach to this, which I think is very important that the politicians who are supposed to be representing the nation
[03:47:35.553 --> 03:47:47.819]  come out with a strong message that we, you know, are not going to take this as it is today because I feel it is, more than anything, a blackmail.
[03:47:47.819 --> 03:47:57.864]  Especially, you know, because the British and the Dutch have also been saying that if we don't do what they say, our application to the EU is not going to happen.
[03:47:57.864 --> 03:48:02.126]  But why would you want to be part of the EU and go under all their taxes and control?
[03:48:02.851 --> 03:48:13.514]  Well, I don't want to do it, especially because I'm in the committee that deals with the application and I've seen what sort of thing the European Union is.
[03:48:13.514 --> 03:48:18.156]  Oh, tell us what the European Union, as a Member of Parliament, seeing the application.
[03:48:18.156 --> 03:48:19.036]  Tell folks what it does.
[03:48:19.036 --> 03:48:23.217]  I mean, that's like saying, give us all your power or we won't beat you in the head with a hammer.
[03:48:23.497 --> 03:48:24.398]  Well, it's a very strange organization.
[03:48:41.989 --> 03:48:46.271]  Which is probably the heaven of bureaucrats.
[03:48:46.271 --> 03:48:51.633]  The heaven of bureaucrats, yes!
[03:48:51.633 --> 03:48:59.597]  But the Social Democrats, who are the biggest party now, it's been their dream for a long time to join the European Union, so they put in the application.
[03:48:59.597 --> 03:49:02.298]  And they had sold the nation, that was another con.
[03:49:02.298 --> 03:49:08.901]  They sold the nation that, oh, in order for us to see what the European Union has to offer to us,
[03:49:09.521 --> 03:49:10.402]  We have to apply.
[03:49:10.402 --> 03:49:15.685]  But they did not tell us that it actually is an integrational process.
[03:49:15.685 --> 03:49:28.992]  And in the meanwhile, you know, while we're really suffering from this financial collapse, we're spending so much money on this particular application where you could get all the information about the deal without applying.
[03:49:30.581 --> 03:49:31.421]  Amazing!
[03:49:31.421 --> 03:49:31.842]  Absolutely!
[03:49:31.842 --> 03:49:34.183]  I mean, the EU is completely undemocratic.
[03:49:34.183 --> 03:49:36.143]  The bureaucrats will take you over.
[03:49:36.143 --> 03:49:45.287]  If you started saying you agreed with them, and if you voted for it, you'd suddenly have some $500,000, $300,000 lavish job in Brussels.
[03:49:45.287 --> 03:49:48.788]  They're exempt from most of the taxes they levy on the countries.
[03:49:48.788 --> 03:49:55.671]  I mean, that's the mark of corruption, is when the government is exempt from the laws the people are under.
[03:49:55.671 --> 03:49:57.392]  Yeah.
[03:49:57.392 --> 03:49:58.192]  I totally agree.
[03:49:58.192 --> 03:49:59.893]  I don't think, you know, in any way,
[03:50:00.845 --> 03:50:02.327]  You know, I wear for the EU.
[03:50:02.327 --> 03:50:07.873]  This is not the right time to go and apply for membership because, you know, we're on our knees.
[03:50:07.873 --> 03:50:12.158]  And that is not a good space to negotiate at all for a good deal.
[03:50:12.158 --> 03:50:18.004]  But if the banks still take over and loot you guys, the public's gonna rise up again.
[03:50:18.004 --> 03:50:21.228]  Certainly your populations learn the lesson that standing up's the answer.
[03:50:22.421 --> 03:50:40.651]  Absolutely, and I really, really hope that by, you know, if we can get support from people from around the world who are fed up with the same sort of, you know, responsibilities they're given by the bankers, but basically, you know, they're basically erasing the middle class.
[03:50:40.651 --> 03:50:41.731]  That's what they're doing.
[03:50:41.731 --> 03:50:47.134]  Every time you get a house, you own a house, or you have savings, they suck it up when their bubbles burst.
[03:50:47.134 --> 03:50:48.395]  So we need to do this together.
[03:50:49.102 --> 03:50:49.503]  We do.
[03:50:49.503 --> 03:50:50.764]  We're doing it together.
[03:50:50.764 --> 03:50:52.206]  Final segment coming up.
[03:50:52.206 --> 03:50:53.948]  We may twist your arm, do five more minutes.
[03:50:53.948 --> 03:50:55.630]  After that we can take calls.
[03:50:55.630 --> 03:50:58.013]  Scott, Fred, Alex, Rick, stay there.
[03:50:58.013 --> 03:51:00.436]  You'll get to talk to the member of Iceland's parliament.
[03:51:01.286 --> 03:51:04.667]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[03:51:04.667 --> 03:51:08.569]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[03:51:08.569 --> 03:51:14.171]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride, at less than 2 cents per gallon?
[03:51:14.171 --> 03:51:19.593]  Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and
[03:51:21.664 --> 03:51:21.904]  I think so.
[03:51:45.550 --> 03:51:48.515]  And, ship all orders over $50 free of charge.
[03:51:48.515 --> 03:51:51.059]  Visit BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[03:51:51.059 --> 03:51:52.962]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[03:51:52.962 --> 03:51:53.823]  Or, call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:51:53.823 --> 03:51:54.424]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today!
[03:52:02.319 --> 03:52:06.345]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:06.345 --> 03:52:09.590]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:14.397]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:14.397 --> 03:52:18.242]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[03:52:18.863 --> 03:52:20.765]  And they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:20.765 --> 03:52:25.949]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:25.949 --> 03:52:29.231]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:52:29.231 --> 03:52:36.076]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.076 --> 03:52:38.418]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:38.418 --> 03:52:40.019]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.019 --> 03:52:42.221]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:42.441 --> 03:52:46.827]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[03:52:46.827 --> 03:52:49.730]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[03:52:49.730 --> 03:52:58.862]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:53:01.204 --> 03:53:03.185]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:53:03.185 --> 03:53:08.546]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:53:08.546 --> 03:53:10.147]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:53:10.147 --> 03:53:18.549]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:53:18.549 --> 03:53:24.271]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:53:24.451 --> 03:53:26.291]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:53:26.291 --> 03:53:28.592]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:53:28.592 --> 03:53:33.013]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:53:33.013 --> 03:53:35.234]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:53:35.234 --> 03:53:43.056]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[03:53:43.336 --> 03:53:43.816]  We're good.
[03:54:13.424 --> 03:54:19.628]  Yeah, sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace!
[03:54:19.628 --> 03:54:21.990]  That's what the bankers are!
[03:54:48.385 --> 03:54:54.050]  Birgitta Jones-Dottier, chairman of her party in Iceland, member of parliament.
[03:54:54.050 --> 03:54:57.253]  She's with us for another five minutes in the next hour.
[03:54:57.253 --> 03:55:01.457]  Then, we are joined by Katherine Austin-Fitz.
[03:55:01.457 --> 03:55:03.939]  You do not want to miss that on BankerGate.
[03:55:03.939 --> 03:55:05.781]  This is the big issue that affects everybody.
[03:55:07.578 --> 03:55:12.864]  And she was Assistant Secretary of Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner in the first Bush Administration.
[03:55:12.864 --> 03:55:14.826]  Always powerful interview, that's coming up.
[03:55:14.826 --> 03:55:18.290]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls for our guests.
[03:55:18.290 --> 03:55:21.514]  Scott, you're on the air from Texas with our guests.
[03:55:21.514 --> 03:55:22.835]  Go ahead, Scott.
[03:55:22.835 --> 03:55:24.978]  Hi, Birgitte.
[03:55:24.978 --> 03:55:28.562]  Back during the banking crisis when it hit the news here,
[03:55:29.791 --> 03:55:34.594]  Ron Paul was interviewed and asked his opinion of what we should do.
[03:55:34.594 --> 03:55:38.296]  And of course he said, let the banks fail.
[03:55:38.296 --> 03:55:43.859]  And then they asked Dr. Paul, what does Congress think we should do?
[03:55:43.859 --> 03:55:47.341]  And Dr. Paul said, Congress doesn't have a clue.
[03:55:49.297 --> 03:56:02.075]  Do you have the same frustration in Iceland that, would you say, is the same level that Dr. Paul has here of the ignorance, just plain old ignorance, that exists in the body of lawmakers?
[03:56:04.590 --> 03:56:05.150]  Absolutely.
[03:56:05.150 --> 03:56:07.834]  Thank you for this question.
[03:56:07.834 --> 03:56:15.844]  I think it's actually been quite shocking to see the level of ignorance and lack of being able to see the whole picture.
[03:56:15.844 --> 03:56:20.129]  And I remember I went to Parliament when they passed the emergency law.
[03:56:20.129 --> 03:56:22.772]  I was just an ordinary citizen back then.
[03:56:23.833 --> 03:56:31.720]  And I was looking at the members of Parliament and they all looked like five-year-old children feeling really embarrassed about the situation.
[03:56:31.720 --> 03:56:33.902]  It did not make me feel very comfortable.
[03:56:33.902 --> 03:56:40.147]  And then the expert bankers from the Treasury prance in and use a bunch of fancy language and tell them what to do.
[03:56:40.147 --> 03:56:42.849]  It's time to arrest these people.
[03:56:42.849 --> 03:56:43.810]  Absolutely.
[03:56:43.810 --> 03:56:52.097]  One good thing about this entire economical collapse in Iceland, I don't know how it is in the States, is that people have actually educated themselves a lot about it.
[03:56:54.164 --> 03:56:55.605]  Yes, it is waking people up.
[03:56:55.605 --> 03:56:57.346]  That's been the good byproduct.
[03:56:57.346 --> 03:56:58.366]  Yes.
[03:56:58.366 --> 03:57:08.310]  So, I have a tendency to try to look into, you know, what can we learn from it and are there any positive elements in the particular situation.
[03:57:08.310 --> 03:57:11.091]  And I think there is a lot of good positive elements in this.
[03:57:11.795 --> 03:57:20.239]  For me, it is a dream come true to see the Icelandic wake up to realize that they can actually be the change makers in their own world.
[03:57:20.239 --> 03:57:22.300]  Yes, real change, not fake Obama change.
[03:57:22.300 --> 03:57:22.860]  Thank you, Scott.
[03:57:22.860 --> 03:57:23.441]  Good question.
[03:57:23.441 --> 03:57:26.602]  Fred in Ohio, your question to the lawmaker from Iceland.
[03:57:26.602 --> 03:57:32.465]  Yes, my question to your guest, Alex, is how can we, the American people, support your fight in
[03:57:33.935 --> 03:57:47.262]  Well, I'd say this, email their media, letters to the editor, call people you know in Iceland, spread the news, the articles that our guest Jones Dotier writes.
[03:57:47.262 --> 03:57:49.743]  What else can they do to support your fight against the New World Order?
[03:57:51.279 --> 03:57:58.481]  We're setting up a site that is going to be up in about a week called... I'm just reading out the site address.
[03:57:58.481 --> 03:57:59.321]  It's not ready yet.
[03:57:59.321 --> 03:58:01.902]  There's going to be probably something on it tomorrow.
[03:58:01.902 --> 03:58:05.102]  It's SaveThePeopleOfIceland.com.
[03:58:05.102 --> 03:58:14.124]  And I think more than anything the Icelandic people need to feel that they are supported by you guys who are listening to this and who have been reading live.
[03:58:14.124 --> 03:58:16.085]  Yes, SaveThePeopleOfIceland.com.
[03:58:17.679 --> 03:58:18.700]  Mm-hmm.
[03:58:18.700 --> 03:58:20.341]  SaveThePeopleOfIceland.com.
[03:58:20.341 --> 03:58:21.602]  What great questions.
[03:58:21.602 --> 03:58:22.402]  Anything else, Fred?
[03:58:22.402 --> 03:58:23.163]  No, that's it.
[03:58:23.163 --> 03:58:24.384]  Thank you.
[03:58:24.384 --> 03:58:27.966]  We're gonna come back and talk to Alex and Rick and a few others.
[03:58:27.966 --> 03:58:28.746]  One-minute break.
[03:58:28.746 --> 03:58:32.369]  Final five minutes with Birgitta Jones-Dottir.
[03:58:32.369 --> 03:58:33.730]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:58:33.730 --> 03:58:38.533]  Worldwide, the people rising against the International Banking Crime Syndicate.
[03:58:38.533 --> 03:58:39.694]  We must prevail!
[03:58:42.853 --> 03:58:45.455]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:45.455 --> 03:58:50.678]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:50.678 --> 03:58:55.222]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:58:55.222 --> 03:58:56.142]  Number one.
[03:58:56.142 --> 03:58:59.565]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:58:59.565 --> 03:59:00.425]  Number two.
[03:59:00.425 --> 03:59:05.329]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:05.329 --> 03:59:06.069]  It's true.
[03:59:06.069 --> 03:59:10.933]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:10.933 --> 03:59:11.393]  Number three.
[03:59:11.733 --> 03:59:15.335]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:59:15.335 --> 03:59:20.038]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:59:20.038 --> 03:59:22.800]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
