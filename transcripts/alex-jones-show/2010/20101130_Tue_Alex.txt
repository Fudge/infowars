[00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:09.731]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.352 --> 00:00:11.173]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:12.895]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.475 --> 00:00:17.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.745]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:38.120]  It is Tuesday, the 30th day of November, 2010.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.982]  Can you believe we're about to enter the final month of 2010?
[00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:44.062]  And it's 2011, 2012, and beyond.
[00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:45.503]  We've got Wayne Madsen in 30 minutes popping in.
[00:00:45.903 --> 00:00:47.263]  He's of course worked for the NSA.
[00:00:54.062 --> 00:00:56.103]  The Navy, RCA, you name it.
[00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.704]  He covers national security and hacking.
[00:01:00.184 --> 00:01:03.065]  He's going to give us his view on the WikiLeaks situation.
[00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:11.348]  I've now had time the last few days to really analyze what's happening and I've got my cautious view of exactly what I think's going on here.
[00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.610]  So that's coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.013]  Then we've got Larry Pratt popping in because there's more and more cases of people who have legal guns and have not committed a crime.
[00:01:24.113 --> 00:01:33.036]  But the neighbors see the guns, mommy sees the guns, they see TV ads saying report illegal guns, and billboards that show images of revolvers.
[00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:37.237]  They call the police on you, and they will call two guns at Arsenal.
[00:01:38.137 --> 00:01:40.638]  There is no law, but the juries are so ignorant.
[00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:43.405]  That they will actually send you to prison.
[00:01:43.906 --> 00:01:45.127]  And that's in the news today.
[00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:47.849]  Man given seven years in prison for legal guns.
[00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:49.690]  And I'm seeing more and more of this.
[00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.034]  We've almost had listeners put in prison, what was it, for six years.
[00:01:54.854 --> 00:01:57.176]  Kelly Rushing, Lyon County, Kentucky.
[00:01:57.796 --> 00:02:05.182]  That was in the newspapers in Kentucky because he gave some state police officers a video with the Ron Paul speech from C-SPAN and my film Road to Tyranny.
[00:02:05.462 --> 00:02:10.406]  He was charged for the Ron Paul speech and he was charged for the
[00:02:12.207 --> 00:02:17.331]  He was charged for both and it was quote, these videos are anti-law enforcement.
[00:02:18.312 --> 00:02:22.975]  They weren't even really about law enforcement, but that shows how crazy some of these people are.
[00:02:23.235 --> 00:02:24.776]  These judges, these prosecutors.
[00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:28.179]  The bankers can steal trillions and not tell Congress where the money went.
[00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:41.303]  But if you cover your face while you're being beaten by a billy club, as in the case in Florida that just came out yesterday, even when the video is released, the police say we are charging him with resisting arrest without violence.
[00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:45.527]  Putting the hands over the face, you will let us beat you even though you're non-violent.
[00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:49.149]  It's legal to videotape police all over the country in public places.
[00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.990]  They don't care.
[00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.791]  They will indict you.
[00:02:51.904 --> 00:02:54.086]  It's not illegal to give somebody a Ron Paul video.
[00:02:54.206 --> 00:02:55.607]  They don't care, they will indict you.
[00:02:56.107 --> 00:02:57.348]  It's not illegal to own guns.
[00:02:57.588 --> 00:02:59.030]  They don't care, they will indict you.
[00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.276]  Now, this is not happening everywhere, but more and more, the authoritarian tyranny is being exercised, so that's coming up with Larry Pratt.
[00:03:07.296 --> 00:03:13.981]  Now, obviously, there's a bunch of other insane news, and we're going to be covering it all after this quick break.
[00:03:15.623 --> 00:03:16.624]  We're going to get into WikiLeaks.
[00:03:16.644 --> 00:03:17.744]  We're going to get into the economy.
[00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:24.868]  We're going to get into the article at PrisonPlanet.com, Climate Alarmist Push Force Relocation at Cancun Summit.
[00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:26.749]  We've been talking about this for two weeks.
[00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.712]  Here's the detailed report at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:03:32.055 --> 00:03:37.480]  We've got bizarre statements with the King of Saudi Arabia wanting to microchip terror suspects.
[00:03:38.521 --> 00:03:50.393]  We've got a lot of key information coming up today here in the broadcast and some new TSA information as that soap opera continues.
[00:03:50.993 --> 00:03:53.635]  What the New York Times admits is the biggest story of the last year.
[00:03:54.076 --> 00:03:56.398]  Because it's the story of people getting angry and saying no.
[00:03:56.758 --> 00:04:00.681]  And more polls are out showing that the majority of the population isn't putting up with it.
[00:04:00.982 --> 00:04:05.546]  And if we can beat them on this absurdity, we can stop them on other absurd things they're doing.
[00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:08.668]  But if they get away with this, the sky is the limit.
[00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:10.209]  So that is coming up.
[00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.531]  But after the break...
[00:04:12.597 --> 00:04:19.440]  I'm going to recap again some of what's coming up, but then I'm getting into this key article at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.943]  It's also going up at InfoWars.com as we speak, and Watson rushed this out this morning.
[00:04:24.983 --> 00:04:31.006]  He's going to be beefing the article up with more research, more data, more history of what's happening throughout the day.
[00:04:31.486 --> 00:04:36.048]  This is a maximum effort issue that we're going to be covering after the break.
[00:04:36.688 --> 00:04:38.170]  We'll tell you about it when we return.
[00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.972]  Google Blacklist PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:41.012 --> 00:04:42.334]  This is very serious.
[00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:44.636]  The ongoing fight against the globalists.
[00:04:45.957 --> 00:04:47.739]  And this is wonderful news, actually.
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.065]  As they said in World War II, the fighter pilots, the bomber pilots, if you're not taking flak, you're not over the target.
[00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:56.047]  So we're really getting the enemy's attention.
[00:04:56.067 --> 00:04:56.608]  Stay with us.
[00:04:56.648 --> 00:04:57.609]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.854 --> 00:05:04.797]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:05:05.037 --> 00:05:11.062]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:05:11.442 --> 00:05:18.527]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:05:18.828 --> 00:05:23.411]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:25.833]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:28.635 --> 00:05:32.184]  Or see them online at FiveStarSoap.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:36.093]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:05:36.604 --> 00:05:42.790]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.813]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:05:47.273 --> 00:05:53.579]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:54.420]  Thank you.
[00:06:00.472 --> 00:06:04.695]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:05.015 --> 00:06:05.616]  Number 1.
[00:06:05.936 --> 00:06:09.078]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:09.919]  Number 2.
[00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:14.763]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:15.543]  It's true.
[00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:20.407]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.727 --> 00:06:21.267]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:24.830]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.833]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:29.033 --> 00:06:29.593]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.833 --> 00:06:32.194]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.594 --> 00:06:35.975]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:36.275 --> 00:06:36.475]  Number 5.
[00:06:37.056 --> 00:06:40.977]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:41.197 --> 00:06:45.978]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:50.280]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.980]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.822]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:06:57.743 --> 00:06:57.943]  877-327-0365.
[00:07:01.526 --> 00:07:05.189]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:08.572]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:07:08.813 --> 00:07:13.577]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:07:13.597 --> 00:07:19.842]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:07:20.003 --> 00:07:22.245]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:07:22.765 --> 00:07:23.045]  Tim Geithner?
[00:07:23.065 --> 00:07:23.505]  Bernanke?
[00:07:23.585 --> 00:07:24.206]  They're arsonists!
[00:07:24.246 --> 00:07:25.506]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:07:25.526 --> 00:07:27.767]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:07:41.673 --> 00:07:43.513]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:07:43.814 --> 00:07:48.555]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:58.857]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:01.298 --> 00:08:06.839]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.103 --> 00:08:15.746]  We've got big news across the board, vital information coming up today.
[00:08:16.346 --> 00:08:27.052]  In about 25 minutes from now, Wayne Madsen is going to join us, formerly with the NSA, reports on national security and hacking issues, to give us his breakdown, his view on WikiLeaks and what they're up to.
[00:08:27.532 --> 00:08:34.176]  Larry Pratt pops in to cover this growing phenomenon of people being arrested for legal guns, even in their own homes.
[00:08:35.177 --> 00:08:38.879]  It says a New Jersey man serving seven years for guns he owned legally,
[00:08:39.795 --> 00:08:43.678]  And that's out of the Philadelphia News, philly.com.
[00:08:44.079 --> 00:08:45.880]  So that is coming up.
[00:08:46.201 --> 00:08:51.485]  Friends and Defense say teenage Portland Patsy shut up by the FBI.
[00:08:52.006 --> 00:08:58.111]  More polls out showing that the mass of the public is firmly against the naked body scanners.
[00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:01.594]  That proves that CBS and NBC have been putting out fake polls.
[00:09:02.495 --> 00:09:07.339]  NBC claiming 98% support it, when all the other scientific polls show the opposite.
[00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:09.360]  We're going to be breaking all of that down.
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.302]  Also, climate alarmists push forced relocation at Cancun's summit.
[00:09:13.562 --> 00:09:15.864]  Detailed report at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:27.610]  Also, for PrisonPlanet.tv members, and this is very important, it'll become evident in a moment, because the censorship against the other venues we use to get out the truth are being attacked.
[00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:33.654]  And the system is attempting to shut those down, those watering holes, where people get reality and key intel.
[00:09:34.654 --> 00:09:39.597]  Dr. Blaylock fluorides deadly secret and he goes into all the soft kill weapons in the food and water.
[00:09:40.317 --> 00:09:42.018]  Former top brain surgeon, retired.
[00:09:42.538 --> 00:09:46.420]  That is that lengthy hour plus interview is at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.381]  We flew across the country to interview him in person.
[00:09:50.042 --> 00:09:54.344]  Also Alex Jones live in Santa Cruz with Dr. Stan Monteith, Ted Anderson,
[00:09:55.564 --> 00:09:58.046]  Michael Swerling, Sheriff Richard Mack, and others.
[00:09:58.106 --> 00:10:03.628]  That's three-plus hours long in super high-quality, high-res, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:10:03.668 --> 00:10:04.389]  Just went up today.
[00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:11.452]  And Paul Craig Roberts, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, how the law was lost, how we've got a lawless, out-of-control criminal government.
[00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:18.836]  These are all sit-down, in-depth, never-before-seen interviews with all of these great individuals at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:10:19.736 --> 00:10:21.157]  I also got some bad news.
[00:10:21.217 --> 00:10:22.217]  I was expecting this.
[00:10:23.298 --> 00:10:32.141]  But as soon as Rand Paul gets in, he's set to probably filibuster in the future if they try to ban a ban on earmarks.
[00:10:32.741 --> 00:10:35.462]  He's promised to try to block earmarks.
[00:10:35.943 --> 00:10:38.844]  But Senate votes down ban on earmarks.
[00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:41.445]  But that's the lame duck Senate.
[00:10:41.905 --> 00:10:47.167]  And eight Republicans defected with the Democrats to make sure in that 39 to 56 vote
[00:10:49.328 --> 00:11:11.165]  uh... that uh... the hog trough uh... as our country bleeds out financially that the gravy train continues uh... but uh... politico has the headline strong showing an anti earmark vote and experts are looking at it saying it may uh... a ban on earmarks may pass in the next senate coming up in january of next year just about a month and a half uh... away from now we're about to enter december
[00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:15.608]  GOP's Cantor says no time to increase taxes on anybody.
[00:11:16.028 --> 00:11:17.269]  I absolutely agree with that.
[00:11:17.289 --> 00:11:28.217]  It's the mega elite, like Google, who pays 2.4% tax because they've written the laws for themselves, who lobby and pose as liberal Democrats wanting higher taxes on the middle class.
[00:11:28.598 --> 00:11:31.520]  They tell the working class that somebody making $200,000 a year is rich.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.741]  Give me a break.
[00:11:34.042 --> 00:11:39.946]  In 2010 numbers, if you go back to 1960s, I've seen the different actuaries on it, somebody making $40,000 a year
[00:11:42.188 --> 00:11:44.709]  Uh, would be basically making $200,000 today.
[00:11:45.229 --> 00:11:47.690]  Now, is somebody making $40,000 a year rich?
[00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.111]  The dollar has been devalued.
[00:11:50.131 --> 00:11:52.892]  If you're making millions of dollars a year, you're nouveau riche.
[00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:55.893]  If you're making billions a year, you're new elite rich.
[00:11:56.313 --> 00:12:03.616]  If you can have shares in the private Federal Reserve and literally can print trillions of dollars for yourself, you're mega inside elite.
[00:12:04.742 --> 00:12:08.625]  Okay, so that is just some of what's coming up on that front.
[00:12:08.706 --> 00:12:11.468]  Obviously, WikiLeaks of the Second Amendment attacks.
[00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:18.174]  An amazing video that we posted on PrisonPlanet.com titled, The Madness of a Lost Society.
[00:12:18.234 --> 00:12:20.015]  I'm going to be playing that coming up.
[00:12:21.207 --> 00:12:32.112]  In the next hour, it's in an article titled, Americans are willing to trample one another to get their hands on cheap, foreign-made plastic garbage, even as the United States turns into a post-industrial wasteland.
[00:12:32.132 --> 00:12:47.580]  Let me tell you, driving across Texas to visit family, as I do once a year, every time I take the same route from Austin to East Texas, the towns that I drove through that just five years ago were vibrant, you can see them dying, and the energy being just sucked out of them.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.482]  And Texas is positioned better than any other state, economically.
[00:12:52.462 --> 00:12:58.166]  I mean, these towns are literally, the paint is peeling, most of the shops are shut down, everything is falling apart.
[00:12:59.186 --> 00:13:04.590]  It just absolutely disgusts me to my core to see this happening, but this is globalism.
[00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:15.296]  And then to watch all these videos on the news of people trampling each other and fighting over Black Friday, sales tax discounts, fighting over crud.
[00:13:17.458 --> 00:13:20.519]  I mean, if I've got to do shopping, I certainly don't do it on Black Friday.
[00:13:20.539 --> 00:13:34.343]  I mean, it's worth it to pay the sales tax and not be around hordes of self-propelled stomachs that are just running around, foaming at the mouth to snatch up all the goods.
[00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.914]  They don't care about their liberty, the real engine of wealth and dignity and honor.
[00:13:39.214 --> 00:13:40.355]  They care about crud.
[00:13:40.816 --> 00:13:43.959]  Very powerful video that we're going to be playing.
[00:13:43.979 --> 00:13:45.981]  I've never seen this channel before and I'm a fan of it now.
[00:13:46.641 --> 00:13:53.908]  The channel's kind of got a long, confusing, well, I mean, not confusing handle, but hard to remember, so I'll just give you one of the video names.
[00:13:53.929 --> 00:13:57.672]  You can find it easier that way, but it is up on Prison Planet.
[00:13:58.613 --> 00:13:59.713]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:13:59.913 --> 00:14:01.534]  Guys, I forgot to turn my phone off.
[00:14:01.554 --> 00:14:02.734]  Will somebody come grab it and turn it off?
[00:14:03.015 --> 00:14:03.315]  Thank you.
[00:14:03.355 --> 00:14:04.615]  It's a bit distracting there.
[00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:04.995]  Thank you.
[00:14:05.855 --> 00:14:06.516]  My fault there.
[00:14:06.876 --> 00:14:07.196]  Okay.
[00:14:08.216 --> 00:14:13.198]  Now, let me focus here and give you the big announcement of the day.
[00:14:14.401 --> 00:14:21.485]  Obviously, you can go to Alexa or StatBrain or Google Analytics and look at InfoWars.com alone.
[00:14:22.266 --> 00:14:27.469]  It's bigger than Rush Limbaugh's site, bigger than Glenn Beck's site, bigger than MSNBC.com.
[00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:28.949]  Just InfoWars.
[00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:34.913]  In fact, you can combine some of these mega-sites against InfoWars and InfoWars.com is bigger.
[00:14:35.996 --> 00:14:36.316]  Okay?
[00:14:37.558 --> 00:14:40.081]  And the system is fully aware of this and understands.
[00:14:40.141 --> 00:14:41.182]  And we have Prison Planet.
[00:14:41.522 --> 00:14:42.443]  Bigger than Glenn Beck.
[00:14:42.503 --> 00:14:43.604]  Bigger than MSNBC.
[00:14:44.225 --> 00:14:47.829]  And we've got screenshots of those graphs and breakdowns in this article.
[00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:50.031]  So, the system is fully aware of us.
[00:14:50.572 --> 00:14:54.276]  Conservatively, 200 million views in the last two years.
[00:14:54.496 --> 00:14:55.778]  That number's about six months old.
[00:14:57.881 --> 00:14:59.963]  So it's much more than that, probably 230 million.
[00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:01.125]  That's again, that's conservative.
[00:15:01.445 --> 00:15:02.346]  Just on YouTube.
[00:15:02.726 --> 00:15:12.877]  Now do you think the system likes 200 plus million views on just our channels and allied channels?
[00:15:12.917 --> 00:15:14.359]  That's just counting a few of our big channels.
[00:15:14.659 --> 00:15:16.361]  I'm not even trying to count the thousands of others.
[00:15:16.922 --> 00:15:17.923]  Do you think they like 200?
[00:15:19.465 --> 00:15:21.867]  Plus million people seeing it on one platform.
[00:15:22.408 --> 00:15:23.308]  That's only one part!
[00:15:24.349 --> 00:15:27.532]  Over 70 AM and FM affiliates, not counting micros and pirates.
[00:15:28.813 --> 00:15:31.736]  Global shortwave, 8 hours a day, WWCR.
[00:15:34.238 --> 00:15:34.699]  XM.
[00:15:35.419 --> 00:15:35.860]  Sirius.
[00:15:38.015 --> 00:15:39.916]  Number one on internet streams.
[00:15:40.596 --> 00:15:43.017]  Number one talk show on the web for free streams on the web.
[00:15:43.837 --> 00:15:46.298]  Over 300,000 downloading the podcast every day.
[00:15:46.638 --> 00:15:52.860]  We conservatively, just on the radio show, reach more than 2 million people a day.
[00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:59.031]  We're now reaching over a million a day just on InfoWars and Prison Planet combined.
[00:15:59.551 --> 00:16:01.592]  This is really scaring the system.
[00:16:01.632 --> 00:16:02.532]  I'm not here bragging.
[00:16:02.812 --> 00:16:04.113]  I'm telling you, we're in danger.
[00:16:04.433 --> 00:16:11.076]  We're on the front lines, over the enemy, over the targets, taking heavy flak in ways I'm not even going to get into today.
[00:16:11.936 --> 00:16:21.520]  I mean, they're pulling out all the dirty tricks, all the black ops, all the psychological warfare, and I'm telling you, we need to stand up and fight them harder than ever, but I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:16:22.645 --> 00:16:23.707]  I'm getting up even earlier.
[00:16:23.827 --> 00:16:24.989]  I got even more energy.
[00:16:25.931 --> 00:16:30.599]  It's not till I really get persecuted and attacked that I get fired up.
[00:16:31.977 --> 00:16:33.418]  And I know a lot of you are the same way.
[00:16:33.438 --> 00:16:37.360]  You've got a fighting spirit, you've got the love of liberty in your heart, and you're beautiful.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:46.824]  And the real power of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and the articles and the films... You think InfoWars and Prison Planet are big.
[00:16:46.844 --> 00:16:48.025]  You think the radio show's big.
[00:16:48.785 --> 00:16:49.546]  It's evergreen.
[00:16:49.646 --> 00:16:50.686]  It goes on forever.
[00:16:50.966 --> 00:16:53.968]  Globalist lies from a month ago become stale within days.
[00:16:54.946 --> 00:16:58.334]  What we talk about over the years has that staying power.
[00:16:58.454 --> 00:17:02.002]  It gets more and more and more and more powerful.
[00:17:02.303 --> 00:17:04.227]  Like pebbles in a pond.
[00:17:05.981 --> 00:17:08.122]  With the ripples never dissipating.
[00:17:08.142 --> 00:17:10.063]  And now we're throwing boulders into a pond.
[00:17:10.504 --> 00:17:14.966]  And it's just causing a massive butterfly effect.
[00:17:14.986 --> 00:17:21.510]  You can research that physics modeling breakdown, dealing with weather if you'd like.
[00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:29.295]  But the butterfly effect is applicable to so many other systems in the world.
[00:17:30.175 --> 00:17:34.418]  So I'm going to get into all the news, but the news is we are under attack.
[00:17:35.518 --> 00:17:39.602]  And just one of the ways is, Watson's article says this happened last week.
[00:17:39.622 --> 00:17:41.544]  To be technical, it happened about two and a half weeks ago.
[00:17:42.765 --> 00:17:44.867]  Google has blacklisted PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:46.596 --> 00:17:57.539]  For eight years, PrisonPlanet.com, all of our articles that we write and post are then put on the Google News Feed aggregator.
[00:17:57.939 --> 00:17:58.660]  Not the web!
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.060]  People click on the web and they go, I can still see your website.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:10.963]  If you go to Google and type in InfoWars.com and click web, like you can click video or places or... You'll understand the links at the top.
[00:18:11.543 --> 00:18:13.724]  And this is all in the article and some people are confused.
[00:18:14.753 --> 00:18:17.855]  And they're confused about the YouTube video I put out, even though it's crystal clear.
[00:18:19.176 --> 00:18:23.838]  Google News has banned Prison Planet from its feed.
[00:18:25.399 --> 00:18:33.184]  In over two weeks, there are no Prison Planet or InfoWars.com articles making it into the feed.
[00:18:33.224 --> 00:18:41.589]  Before, in one minute after we publish an article, you could type in the headline or something similar into Google, click News, and you would see our latest articles.
[00:18:42.915 --> 00:18:56.540]  So we could be on the level playing field with MSNBC, Fox, CNN, National Public Radio, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Dallas Morning News, The Austin American-Statesman, and thousands and thousands of other publications.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.541]  BBC, Tokyo News, all of it.
[00:19:00.082 --> 00:19:00.762]  China Daily.
[00:19:02.423 --> 00:19:02.963]  Al Jazeera.
[00:19:03.826 --> 00:19:04.466]  Not anymore.
[00:19:04.906 --> 00:19:06.147]  They've said, you're winning!
[00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:07.768]  You're too effective!
[00:19:08.508 --> 00:19:09.668]  This is a rigged game!
[00:19:10.289 --> 00:19:13.430]  PrisonPlanet.com, and they haven't told us why, but we know why.
[00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:14.290]  We're becoming too effective.
[00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:15.731]  You are banned!
[00:19:17.091 --> 00:19:23.634]  And we're seeing evidence that they're starting to restrict us and push us down in ranking on the regular web link search.
[00:19:23.674 --> 00:19:24.534]  Now, it gets worse.
[00:19:26.775 --> 00:19:27.976]  It gets a lot worse.
[00:19:28.016 --> 00:19:30.797]  You see this email we got from the official?
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.542]  YouTube, which is a subsidiary of Google, I'm going to tell you about this.
[00:19:37.602 --> 00:19:43.144]  They told us that they're going to freeze, and it normally happens within a few hours.
[00:19:43.625 --> 00:19:44.565]  It hasn't happened yet.
[00:19:45.425 --> 00:19:54.389]  This is officially from YouTube, subsidiary of Google, that they're going to freeze or they imply shut down the Alex Jones Channel for no reason.
[00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.590]  And normally you got to get three strikes.
[00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.571]  They're saying one strike, you're out.
[00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:00.072]  We got to shut Jones down.
[00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.871]  Do you have pain from an injury or headache?
[00:20:04.191 --> 00:20:06.212]  Would you like to alleviate that pain in 10 minutes?
[00:20:06.693 --> 00:20:11.115]  Science has now figured out how to put sound frequencies into a kale and clay and polymer gel.
[00:20:11.575 --> 00:20:17.279]  Once applied to the area of injury, frequency signals are transmitted that activates the release of prostaglandin hormones.
[00:20:17.639 --> 00:20:21.561]  Your body's own prostaglandin hormones go to work to eliminate inflammation.
[00:20:21.961 --> 00:20:25.824]  The result is the elimination of pain in 10 minutes for 90% of users.
[00:20:26.244 --> 00:20:28.725]  We have thermography pictures to prove its effectiveness.
[00:20:29.106 --> 00:20:31.127]  Here's what Jody from San Diego had to say.
[00:20:31.727 --> 00:20:34.048]  I have a weakness in my neck from a car accident.
[00:20:34.288 --> 00:20:38.689]  About once a month I have neck pain and the only thing that has ever helped is going to the chiropractor.
[00:20:38.969 --> 00:20:43.470]  To my surprise, the Knockout Pain Cream took away the headache and my neck seemed just fine.
[00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:44.990]  No adjustment required.
[00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:46.950]  The product has already paid for itself.
[00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.571]  To order or learn more about Knockout Pain Cream, call 888-988-3325.
[00:20:50.631 --> 00:20:50.811]  That's 888-988-3325.
[00:20:50.831 --> 00:20:52.071]  Or visit knockoutpaincream.com.
[00:21:00.287 --> 00:21:05.151]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:21:05.251 --> 00:21:06.032]  What have we got?
[00:21:06.232 --> 00:21:08.374]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:21:08.694 --> 00:21:09.435]  A republic.
[00:21:09.695 --> 00:21:12.277]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:14.259]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:21:14.599 --> 00:21:16.521]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:21:16.641 --> 00:21:17.922]  So they think they own our land?
[00:21:18.322 --> 00:21:19.423]  They think they own our water?
[00:21:19.644 --> 00:21:20.044]  Children?
[00:21:20.244 --> 00:21:21.025]  Our education?
[00:21:21.365 --> 00:21:22.006]  Our money?
[00:21:22.186 --> 00:21:25.849]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:21:26.209 --> 00:21:29.854]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:30.856]  You are being warned.
[00:21:31.176 --> 00:21:31.997]  We have the facts.
[00:21:32.197 --> 00:21:33.319]  We have the Constitution.
[00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:34.240]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.101]  We have common law.
[00:21:35.161 --> 00:21:37.404]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:37.685 --> 00:21:40.388]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:21:40.629 --> 00:21:41.450]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:46.334]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:47.875]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:48.856]  Don't tread on me.
[00:21:49.096 --> 00:21:55.160]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:21:59.844 --> 00:22:00.184]  G'day!
[00:22:00.465 --> 00:22:02.006]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:22:02.226 --> 00:22:02.987]  November 30th, 2010.
[00:22:03.227 --> 00:22:05.529]  Gold open this morning at $13.7280.
[00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:10.053]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $14.0842, $7.0421 for a half-ounce, or $3.5210 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:22:10.113 --> 00:22:10.553]  That's $14.0842, $7.0421, or $3.5210.
[00:22:19.528 --> 00:22:23.309]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm, warning of Greek-style U.S.
[00:22:23.369 --> 00:22:24.169]  debt crises.
[00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:26.630]  CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S.
[00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:28.771]  economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[00:22:29.111 --> 00:22:34.152]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[00:22:34.472 --> 00:22:35.452]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:35.472 --> 00:22:41.214]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[00:22:41.414 --> 00:22:47.241]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population, and rising interest rates spells economic disaster.
[00:22:47.581 --> 00:22:48.222]  Call today at 800-686-2237.

[00:22:49.684 --> 00:22:50.745]  Ask for the CBO document.
[00:22:50.765 --> 00:22:50.966]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.716 --> 00:23:02.637]  Do you want to get away from additives and preservatives in your food?
[00:23:02.897 --> 00:23:05.317]  Need alternatives to conventional food preparation?
[00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:07.878]  Do you want to save the fruits of your gardening labor?
[00:23:08.118 --> 00:23:10.218]  And are you looking for an excellent gift idea?
[00:23:10.458 --> 00:23:12.479]  Then check out the Excalibur Dehydrator.

[00:23:45.553 --> 00:23:46.073]  Or call 1-800-875-4254.
[00:23:53.217 --> 00:23:55.778]  That's 1-800-875-4254.
[00:23:55.958 --> 00:23:59.179]  Season's greetings and health and wellness from Excalibur Dehydrator.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.561]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:04.581 --> 00:24:08.402]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:12.654 --> 00:24:34.527]  So to be clear, we have many YouTube channels and we've had fake complaints following them over and over again and when they're successful we just file a counter-demand and in the past they've been forced to reinstate the channel or channels because we filed and agreed to a federal court's jurisdiction and say we're ready to go to court.
[00:24:36.051 --> 00:24:39.013]  A, this isn't a copyright violation, or B, this isn't vulgar.
[00:24:39.813 --> 00:24:47.357]  Now this time, Google admits that they reviewed it, and that they think it's a community violation, which we've never had before, one of those.
[00:24:48.138 --> 00:24:49.398]  It's not a copyright issue.
[00:24:49.919 --> 00:24:55.301]  And that because we've challenged it, they don't say we were correct or incorrect.
[00:24:55.602 --> 00:25:01.545]  They say they're going to shut our channel down for two weeks, and they go on to say that they may just suspend it altogether.
[00:25:02.412 --> 00:25:11.160]  So, in the new America, where they operate as this public commons, as long as you follow the rules, the rules are different for different people.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:21.649]  So, in the same period of time that PrisonPlanet.com is banned and blocked from the, and we've been waiting two weeks watching this, it's definitely confirmed,
[00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:23.292]  And they won't tell us why.
[00:25:23.532 --> 00:25:26.217]  Blocked from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:25:26.258 --> 00:25:29.023]  Blocked from the Google News Feed.
[00:25:29.283 --> 00:25:30.866]  Not the Google Web Feed.
[00:25:30.886 --> 00:25:32.629]  The Google News Feed.
[00:25:33.496 --> 00:25:36.897]  That so many other news agencies and others research from.
[00:25:37.658 --> 00:25:39.138]  And more and more we're driving the news.
[00:25:39.578 --> 00:25:44.260]  The globalists know that we broke the TSA story and pushed it out there and got Drudge to pick it up.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.601]  We're the original catalyst with our listeners.
[00:25:47.001 --> 00:25:48.062]  They're aware of this.
[00:25:48.442 --> 00:25:49.322]  They're scared of this.
[00:25:49.362 --> 00:25:56.605]  They know this show has really driven and energized fledgling movements like 9-11 Truth nine plus years ago.
[00:25:57.597 --> 00:26:02.720]  The system is aware of your efforts, my efforts, and how effective we are.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.521]  And so here's their letter.
[00:26:04.541 --> 00:26:07.462]  We'll put it up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:26:07.763 --> 00:26:15.847]  We've just blocked out our email and the YouTube copyright specific email.
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.544]  And it says here, hi there, thanks for your email.
[00:26:20.784 --> 00:26:26.751]  The video you posted was in violation of YouTube's community guidelines as reported by users and verified by YouTube team.
[00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:31.637]  Accordingly, the ability to post new content to YouTube from this account has been disabled.
[00:26:33.069 --> 00:26:33.930]  Sometimes it takes a while.
[00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:34.670]  They haven't done it yet.
[00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:35.491]  We got this last night.
[00:26:35.751 --> 00:26:39.493]  And will not return until two weeks after you acknowledge the message within your account.
[00:26:39.533 --> 00:26:41.174]  Well, even to get into the account, you have to acknowledge it.
[00:26:41.194 --> 00:26:42.475]  So we've acknowledged it last night about 7.
[00:26:42.775 --> 00:26:43.195]  I was up here.
[00:26:43.876 --> 00:26:49.720]  Please review the YouTube Community Guidelines and refrain from further violations, which may result in the termination of your accounts.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.020]  Account accounts.
[00:26:51.561 --> 00:26:56.004]  Additional non-video penalties may be recorded in your account.
[00:26:56.824 --> 00:26:57.465]  And it goes on.
[00:26:57.525 --> 00:27:21.446]  Now, here was our original response a few weeks ago to this, and we explained that there's no vulgarity, nothing, that many other YouTube sites have posted this, including the official CBS News Channel, the official Al Jazeera, the official RT, the official CNN, the official, I mean, you name it, ABC, I mean, there are literally hundreds of official channels that show the whole video!
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:27.103]  We showed, in our collateral murder video, maybe 30 seconds.
[00:27:27.463 --> 00:27:32.207]  And it's black and white footage of a minivan, and you can't even see the people in it being shot.
[00:27:34.028 --> 00:27:36.230]  I mean, this is nothing compared to what they put on the news every night.
[00:27:38.812 --> 00:27:46.277]  And... So we point out to them, hey, here are all these official news services that are partners with you.
[00:27:46.738 --> 00:27:47.718]  Official partners!
[00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:50.781]  They're allowed to have hour-long videos, not just 15-minute ones.
[00:27:51.562 --> 00:27:59.724]  And here they are, and they've got the same video of the Apache helicopter shooting the Reuters reporter and shooting the minivan with the kids in it.
[00:28:00.224 --> 00:28:02.085]  We did a report on that and talked about it.
[00:28:03.325 --> 00:28:13.888]  And you're saying it's vulgar, and then we point out that it's on all these other channels, and that they're not removing it from any of them, and their answer is, okay, we're shutting your account down.
[00:28:14.128 --> 00:28:14.968]  You can't use it.
[00:28:15.208 --> 00:28:16.548]  You can't get information out.
[00:28:16.729 --> 00:28:18.349]  And if this happens more, you're just gone.
[00:28:22.745 --> 00:28:27.468]  Now, people point out, well, they've removed your Obama deception.
[00:28:27.508 --> 00:28:29.709]  They've, you know, they've removed a lot of your other stuff before.
[00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:31.310]  And that's what they're hoping.
[00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:32.351]  They want to wear you out.
[00:28:32.531 --> 00:28:41.356]  Just like they come out with RFID and the internal industry standards that got leaked a few years ago said 80 plus percent of people don't like this, but we don't care.
[00:28:42.256 --> 00:28:44.718]  Our internal research shows people just give up.
[00:28:45.078 --> 00:28:46.379]  If we just push this through,
[00:28:47.625 --> 00:28:48.666]  They'll go ahead and submit.
[00:28:49.286 --> 00:28:51.868]  Same thing on the TSA with sticking their hands down your pants.
[00:28:52.489 --> 00:28:54.150]  Same thing with censorship on the web.
[00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.492]  Remember the article just last week out of WIRED?
[00:28:57.793 --> 00:29:01.175]  Censorship Bill Sales Through Committee?
[00:29:01.616 --> 00:29:05.999]  They're trying to pass it this week or next week where the government can just shut down any websites they want.
[00:29:06.059 --> 00:29:07.160]  No judge, no jury.
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.102]  Just any designate of the Justice Department can shut down any website they want.
[00:29:11.582 --> 00:29:17.965]  If somebody posts a link on a message board they don't like, they're ignoring the DMCA takedown third-party safe harbor.
[00:29:18.185 --> 00:29:28.410]  Meaning if you've got a public site like YouTube or Google or a message board and somebody posts something copyright or whatever, they have to contact the site and let them know and they've got a chance to take it down.
[00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:31.332]  The government says no, we'll shut down whoever we want.
[00:29:33.157 --> 00:29:35.358]  This is all happening now.
[00:29:35.718 --> 00:29:38.139]  This is all going on now.
[00:29:38.619 --> 00:29:40.600]  This is a major issue now.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:47.903]  And we're already banned from government Wi-Fi systems on the train stations in Europe and in England.
[00:29:48.263 --> 00:29:49.944]  I mean, it's happening, folks.
[00:29:51.264 --> 00:29:52.185]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.645 --> 00:29:54.265]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.186 --> 00:29:57.867]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.711 --> 00:30:06.332]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:06.672 --> 00:30:14.793]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:19.554]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:30:20.154 --> 00:30:30.976]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:30:31.596 --> 00:30:40.618]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:41.118 --> 00:30:46.179]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:53.721]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:54.021 --> 00:30:56.442]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:31:02.374 --> 00:31:04.055]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:31:04.855 --> 00:31:05.776]  Tyranny is here.
[00:31:06.116 --> 00:31:09.698]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:31:09.758 --> 00:31:12.280]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:17.724]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:31:18.164 --> 00:31:24.388]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:31:24.808 --> 00:31:30.352]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:31:30.792 --> 00:31:34.475]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:31:34.975 --> 00:31:38.978]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:31:39.258 --> 00:31:44.782]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:31:45.202 --> 00:31:48.165]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:31:48.765 --> 00:31:50.206]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:31:50.746 --> 00:31:51.167]  It's here.

[00:32:04.352 --> 00:32:09.693]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy-to-fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:32:10.053 --> 00:32:14.355]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[00:32:14.815 --> 00:32:18.156]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.
[00:32:18.556 --> 00:32:25.038]  They have two holiday price packs for you to put into your reserves for a secure future or to share with others.
[00:32:25.498 --> 00:32:28.219]  The first is a six-month bulk supply in 10 cans.
[00:32:29.239 --> 00:32:36.242]  And the second is a five-week supply of quick and easy-to-fix meals, including delicious bakery items shipped in heavy tote bags.
[00:32:36.782 --> 00:32:43.445]  Now, for a limited time, when you order two or more of these special holiday packs, you'll get free shipping on your entire order.

[00:32:48.047 --> 00:32:50.448]  That's 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:33:04.535 --> 00:33:10.838]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:27.387]  There is a cocktail, a formula of ways that government, mainstream media, and major educational foundations have admitted that they plan to strangle the Internet.
[00:33:28.387 --> 00:33:31.269]  We've had Senator Rockefeller say we'd be better off without an Internet.
[00:33:32.162 --> 00:33:37.684]  We've had him say he wants to shut down Fox News and MSNBC, that he wants government-controlled media.
[00:33:39.105 --> 00:33:42.286]  We have seen the calls for an Internet ID.
[00:33:42.446 --> 00:33:47.048]  Microsoft already designs their computers to do that, their operating systems, their browsers.
[00:33:48.171 --> 00:33:58.754]  There is a move towards taxing the web, censoring it, arbitrary government power to blacklist any websites or shut them down with no judge or jury.
[00:33:58.874 --> 00:34:00.335]  Australia tried that last year.
[00:34:00.395 --> 00:34:02.376]  They called it Chinese-style net censorship.
[00:34:04.076 --> 00:34:08.958]  The same thing then is now happening in Europe and happening here.
[00:34:09.678 --> 00:34:15.400]  So there's a cocktail, a whole different squadron of ways
[00:34:17.401 --> 00:34:20.683]  That they're doing this, and we've broken it down, we've warned people.
[00:34:20.703 --> 00:34:21.783]  They also have internet too.
[00:34:23.144 --> 00:34:33.529]  A new, higher tier of the internet, where you have to sign on and agree to waive your rights, and where you have a subdomain on a handful, less than a hundred, megasites.
[00:34:34.602 --> 00:34:38.728]  And the Internet2 consortium with government and media meets every year.
[00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:40.330]  They've got massive funding.
[00:34:40.931 --> 00:34:43.335]  They fund it through government grants, through universities.
[00:34:43.795 --> 00:34:47.701]  And they have announced this is how the establishment is going to keep control.
[00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:50.250]  So they build the web through DARPA.
[00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:53.230]  We fund it with our tax money.
[00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:56.391]  We fund it by our ISP bills, by buying computers.
[00:34:57.132 --> 00:35:00.653]  Then once we get addicted, they seize it, they take control of it.
[00:35:00.993 --> 00:35:14.497]  The CIA funds groups like Google with In-Q-Tel money in its founding 11 years ago to then dominate the architecture of the web so that Google becomes the web and then can censor and control whoever they want.
[00:35:14.517 --> 00:35:17.178]  This is what's happening.
[00:35:18.339 --> 00:35:19.259]  This is what they're doing.
[00:35:19.279 --> 00:35:27.223]  Remember two years ago, Lieberman came out and said he wants his office to be able to contact YouTube and tell them what to take down.
[00:35:28.664 --> 00:35:37.968]  And so we are discriminated against by Google's subcompany, YouTube, by their subsidiary.
[00:35:39.602 --> 00:35:41.444]  We are held to a higher standard.
[00:35:42.245 --> 00:35:57.641]  You can have CBS, ABC, NBC, all of them, Al Jazeera, RT, all of them, all of them, are allowed to post the entire video of people machine-gunned from a helicopter.
[00:35:58.662 --> 00:36:01.225]  Compared to even watching a 1950s western, it's not violent.
[00:36:04.212 --> 00:36:06.053]  Because it's black and white, it's from a distance.
[00:36:06.133 --> 00:36:21.924]  We show a snippet and I talk about it, and talk about how the pilots are laughing about it, and how that is sick, and how the men on the ground are human beings, because they're having to see the bleeding children, and they tried to save them and get them aid.
[00:36:22.345 --> 00:36:30.891]  So I pointed out the pilots were disconnected from the killing and the maiming, but that the men on the ground were concerned and retained their humanity.
[00:36:32.665 --> 00:36:33.965]  It was touching what I said.
[00:36:34.345 --> 00:36:35.145]  It was accurate.
[00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:35.786]  It was true.
[00:36:36.446 --> 00:36:40.266]  The video wasn't taken down because it violates the rules.
[00:36:41.307 --> 00:36:46.608]  It was taken down because it pointed out how sickening it was, the pilots enjoying themselves.
[00:36:48.768 --> 00:36:50.749]  The helicopter pilot and the Apache and the gunner.
[00:36:52.169 --> 00:36:53.249]  Sitting there laughing about it.
[00:36:53.989 --> 00:36:55.589]  Haha, shouldn't bring a kid to a battle.
[00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:56.530]  Wasn't a battle.
[00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:58.090]  It was the middle of a major city.
[00:36:59.687 --> 00:37:02.069]  But the men on the ground are like, we've got children, we've got to help them.
[00:37:02.269 --> 00:37:05.231]  And they're running to save them, and they did save them, when our troops show up.
[00:37:05.531 --> 00:37:10.414]  And the guys up in the helicopters, instead of saying, oh man, too bad, they just laughed about it.
[00:37:10.935 --> 00:37:12.276]  Losing their humanity.
[00:37:12.636 --> 00:37:14.998]  That's why that video got taken down.
[00:37:15.938 --> 00:37:25.545]  But the bigger issue is, we then challenge it and say, here are all these links to major news services and other users that you haven't shut down.
[00:37:27.734 --> 00:37:29.515]  Clearly, this is selective enforcement.
[00:37:29.795 --> 00:37:32.717]  And their answer is, hey, we're shutting your site down.
[00:37:32.737 --> 00:37:33.658]  You're not going to be able to use it.
[00:37:34.138 --> 00:37:35.619]  No new videos for the next few weeks.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:41.603]  And we may shut down your whole site with 75 million views.
[00:37:42.024 --> 00:37:42.904]  And it's accelerating.
[00:37:43.084 --> 00:37:49.449]  That one YouTube site, the Alex Jones Channel, the official Alex Jones Channel, is now getting about 2 million views a week.
[00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:54.472]  It's really starting to grow faster, like everything else we do.
[00:37:55.012 --> 00:37:57.174]  And that is what scares the system.
[00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:01.252]  That is what concerns them so much.
[00:38:05.814 --> 00:38:12.338]  Now, Wayne Madsen always shows up for his interviews, but I want to keep covering this and other issues.
[00:38:12.398 --> 00:38:15.660]  It's kind of fortuitous that he must have gotten the time zone confused.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.022]  He'll be on later today on the WikiLeaks situation.
[00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:19.042]  I'll get into it in a moment.
[00:38:20.003 --> 00:38:22.844]  But I do need some more time on this web takeover situation.
[00:38:23.105 --> 00:38:24.565]  So in a way, that's fortuitous.
[00:38:24.686 --> 00:38:24.966]  All right.
[00:38:26.892 --> 00:38:34.994]  Here is the article up at PrisonPlanet.com and I would imagine, since it's been up for an hour, it's probably on Infowars.com by now.
[00:38:35.014 --> 00:38:38.015]  Let me check and see if it's up there.
[00:38:38.535 --> 00:38:41.756]  Yep, Google blacklist PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:38:43.096 --> 00:38:49.338]  Obviously, it's been more than a week and a half since we've done a top Google search trend.
[00:38:50.865 --> 00:39:02.512]  Which then causes hundreds of other publications to pick up on it, like we did over a month ago with top search trend after top search trend about TSA abuse, TSA fondling, TSA molestation.
[00:39:03.212 --> 00:39:09.055]  And then Drudge picked it up and the rest is history, and the New York Times and others have admitted, biggest story in recent history.
[00:39:09.756 --> 00:39:13.878]  We want to make this the top Google search trend.
[00:39:13.898 --> 00:39:14.439]  Hey Google!
[00:39:15.359 --> 00:39:17.460]  You may ban Prison Planet completely.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.402]  You may ban InfoWars.com completely.
[00:39:20.942 --> 00:39:25.684]  But I'm asking every supporter, you're not fans, you're fellow lovers of liberty.
[00:39:25.944 --> 00:39:29.886]  Black, white, German, Jewish, Chinese, Mexican, old, young.
[00:39:30.466 --> 00:39:31.227]  You love freedom.
[00:39:31.667 --> 00:39:35.409]  I'm asking all YouTube users to make their own videos.
[00:39:35.449 --> 00:39:37.530]  We'll post a lot of them on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[00:39:39.124 --> 00:39:48.012]  To make videos about Google censorship, about YouTube censorship, and about what they're doing to PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and our channel.
[00:39:48.433 --> 00:39:56.881]  I want thousands of you to make fancy videos, simple videos, it doesn't matter, about what's happening in our article.
[00:39:57.181 --> 00:40:04.108]  Let's show them the power of humanity coming together for liberty, just like we've done with the TSA.
[00:40:05.333 --> 00:40:06.754]  We do have Madsen, we're going to him in a minute.
[00:40:07.354 --> 00:40:10.515]  Google blacklistprisonplanet.com.
[00:40:11.135 --> 00:40:26.261]  Get that headline, post it on your own website, send it out on your Twitter, send it out on your Facebook, send it out on your MySpace, send it out on your Yahoo groups, send it out on your email list.
[00:40:28.766 --> 00:40:35.715]  But the key is, post it on your article, because when we make this the number one search term, I don't care if Prison Planet doesn't get the traffic from it.
[00:40:36.096 --> 00:40:44.447]  Your website will get the traffic, and they'll read the article, and they'll see my video I shot up here at 8 o'clock in the evening last night, that they're censoring.
[00:40:46.127 --> 00:40:47.788]  I'm not putting up with it.
[00:40:48.248 --> 00:40:56.413]  With the CIA running Google for the offshore banks, trying to take the web over and to slowly shut down free speech and strangle it quietly in the dark.
[00:40:56.833 --> 00:41:05.839]  If you're going to try to strangle free speech and discriminate against people and censor people, we're going to do it in the middle of a sports stadium with millions of people watching.
[00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:09.301]  Everybody's going to see who you are and what you are.
[00:41:11.391 --> 00:41:17.813]  We need to try to block Google gobbling up all these companies, trying to create a combine, a quasi-monopoly.
[00:41:18.573 --> 00:41:20.514]  Google, there's a lot of ways we're going to come after you.
[00:41:20.814 --> 00:41:21.494]  You understand that?
[00:41:21.795 --> 00:41:25.876]  Back off on the First Amendment, or we're going to show you the real power of the info warriors.
[00:41:26.756 --> 00:41:29.337]  I haven't swung the info guns on you yet.
[00:41:29.617 --> 00:41:33.839]  Do you want to feel the power of the sleeping giant that is free humanity?
[00:41:35.239 --> 00:41:36.499]  You think you're unstoppable?
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.600]  The power of people is unlimited.
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.761]  We're going to Wayne in a minute, but I want to point this out.
[00:41:41.937 --> 00:41:42.597]  Three words.
[00:41:43.318 --> 00:41:46.460]  Google blacklistprisonplanet.com.
[00:41:47.341 --> 00:41:50.543]  Google blacklistprisonplanet.com.
[00:41:51.403 --> 00:41:53.865]  You probably want to get Watson to change that where prison planet's one word.
[00:41:53.885 --> 00:41:54.706]  That's how you want to search it.
[00:41:55.226 --> 00:41:57.968]  Google blacklistprisonplanet.com.
[00:41:58.208 --> 00:42:00.270]  Let's make it number one, but I'm gonna do something special today.
[00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:05.033]  I want you to re-enter this today, tomorrow, and the next day.
[00:42:07.028 --> 00:42:10.832]  Google blacklist PrisonPlanet.com and let's fire another torpedo at them.
[00:42:11.132 --> 00:42:12.293]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:12.653 --> 00:42:14.155]  Let's make that the number two search term.
[00:42:14.295 --> 00:42:16.817]  Let's make InfoWars.com the number three search term.
[00:42:17.077 --> 00:42:18.879]  Let's see how they like it.
[00:42:18.999 --> 00:42:22.422]  They'll probably try to block those completely from even searchability.
[00:42:22.603 --> 00:42:23.063]  Fine!
[00:42:23.383 --> 00:42:24.685]  Let's get it on right now!
[00:42:25.585 --> 00:42:26.827]  Let's get it on right now!
[00:42:28.496 --> 00:42:31.937]  You sit there, and you show us you're tyrants.
[00:42:32.117 --> 00:42:35.379]  You show us you discriminate against people that want liberty and freedom.
[00:42:35.859 --> 00:42:36.839]  I'm on the side of right.
[00:42:37.279 --> 00:42:38.180]  I'm for free speech.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.040]  You're not.
[00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:42.581]  Google blacklistprisonplanet.com.
[00:42:42.982 --> 00:42:47.884]  Let's make those three terms, those three words as one term, google blacklistprisonplanet.com.
[00:42:48.084 --> 00:42:49.584]  Let's make it number one today.
[00:42:50.024 --> 00:42:51.885]  And then tomorrow, mark your calendars.
[00:42:52.205 --> 00:42:53.786]  Hit it again, all of us together.
[00:42:54.775 --> 00:42:57.117]  Let's swarm them today, and again at 11 a.m.
[00:42:57.157 --> 00:42:58.578]  tomorrow when the show starts.
[00:42:58.958 --> 00:43:02.581]  And then let's separately search prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:43:03.001 --> 00:43:04.022]  Put it in the search engine.
[00:43:04.262 --> 00:43:04.462]  Hit!
[00:43:05.303 --> 00:43:05.804]  Yahoo!
[00:43:06.064 --> 00:43:06.784]  Hit them all!
[00:43:06.844 --> 00:43:07.685]  Hit them hard!
[00:43:08.305 --> 00:43:14.690]  They want to take the web over like a bunch of big, fat, greedy, authoritarian hogs with their CIA cover name, Don't Be Evil?
[00:43:15.471 --> 00:43:16.472]  Google is evil!
[00:43:18.413 --> 00:43:19.654]  In fact, that's another search term!
[00:43:19.694 --> 00:43:20.775]  Fire another torpedo!
[00:43:21.016 --> 00:43:22.217]  Google is evil!
[00:43:22.597 --> 00:43:24.939]  We're going to search googleblacklowsprisonplanet.com.
[00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:26.781]  We're going to search infowars.com.
[00:43:26.961 --> 00:43:28.583]  We're going to search prisonplanet.com.
[00:43:29.003 --> 00:43:31.706]  And we're going to search Google is evil.
[00:43:32.246 --> 00:43:33.768]  Google is evil.
[00:43:34.188 --> 00:43:35.329]  Google is evil.
[00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:38.152]  You think the devil comes to you and says I'm evil?
[00:43:38.352 --> 00:43:40.354]  No, the devil comes to you and says I'm the angel of light.
[00:43:40.594 --> 00:43:41.295]  I'm the good guy.
[00:43:41.615 --> 00:43:43.477]  He disguises himself as an angel of light.
[00:43:44.557 --> 00:43:49.259]  Before they write news articles and say I'm saying Google is the Antichrist, I'm saying that literary.
[00:43:49.539 --> 00:43:50.820]  I'm saying that in a figurative way.
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.120]  Google is evil.
[00:43:53.521 --> 00:43:54.962]  Google is evil.
[00:43:55.182 --> 00:43:56.282]  Let's see how you like that.
[00:43:56.442 --> 00:43:57.803]  How about we search that every day?
[00:43:58.003 --> 00:43:59.044]  And different variants of it.
[00:44:02.445 --> 00:44:05.747]  The name Obama is already associated with deception in the top searches.
[00:44:05.767 --> 00:44:07.668]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[00:44:07.748 --> 00:44:09.268]  Wayne Madsen got on a little bit light with us.
[00:44:09.288 --> 00:44:11.049]  I'll let him sum it up in the next hour if he can do it.
[00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:12.350]  Because this is important.
[00:44:13.092 --> 00:44:16.155]  I want to get his overall take on the WikiLeaks situation.
[00:44:17.536 --> 00:44:27.184]  Submarine anti-warfare, Naval Command, National Security Agency, list goes on and on, waynemadsonreport.com.
[00:44:27.464 --> 00:44:40.995]  Wayne, give us your view on WikiLeaks, because you predicted six months ago here that they would shift gears and start going after corporations, but selectively, and this is some type of George Soros espionage arm or something.
[00:44:42.196 --> 00:44:43.597]  Give us your view on it, Wayne Madsen.
[00:44:44.317 --> 00:44:49.100]  Oh, Alex, we're being subjected to a huge information warfare operation.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:54.623]  You know, they're trying to say that this Private First Class Bradley Manning was the source.
[00:44:55.493 --> 00:44:56.234]  We're good to go.
[00:45:19.395 --> 00:45:25.879]  There's a lot of grim faces around the world right now except in one particular country and that's Israel.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.261]  We don't know, no benefit.
[00:45:28.701 --> 00:45:33.925]  We have Netanyahu saying nothing in these revelations are harmful to us.
[00:45:33.965 --> 00:45:35.926]  We have Horowitz reporting that nothing
[00:45:36.486 --> 00:45:44.629]  We had Israel admittedly now launch the super worm that our Congress is using to try to take over the web with cyber security.
[00:46:02.876 --> 00:46:06.639]  Right, and we have the U.S.
[00:46:06.759 --> 00:46:21.011]  Ambassador in Turkey, James Jeffries, talking to the Israeli Ambassador there, Gabby Levy, saying, oh look, they're the one, the Prime Minister, he hates Israel, the Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, is a neo-Ottoman.
[00:46:21.771 --> 00:46:23.652]  Yeah, this is State Department moles.
[00:46:49.418 --> 00:46:52.539]  These are State Department moles, and right now it's too early.
[00:46:52.559 --> 00:46:54.040]  I'm just on this story.
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:47:13.008]  I'm focusing on a couple, a State Department couple, a man and a wife, both diplomats, both very much tied in with the Leocon apparatus in Washington, ties to General Petraeus, ties to the Israel lobby here in Washington.
[00:47:14.528 --> 00:47:19.030]  Well, Wayne, that's what I got in the last two days studying this, is that it pushes the U.S.
[00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:22.752]  towards war, it isolates the U.S., to put the U.S.
[00:47:22.852 --> 00:47:29.355]  into a neocon paranoia, and then also, oh look, King Abdullah, he wants to attack Iran too.
[00:47:29.755 --> 00:47:32.716]  Oh look, Pakistan does have nukes and is dangerous.
[00:47:33.077 --> 00:47:35.598]  Oh look, North Korea, China wants to cut them loose.
[00:47:35.998 --> 00:47:42.721]  I mean, we know that the diplomatic corps, the military corps at the officer level is always being fed in an echo chamber propaganda.
[00:47:43.001 --> 00:47:50.908]  Just because we get all these documents, it doesn't mean they're all gospel truth, just like the Office of Special Plans that the Pentagon was feeding fake WMDs.
[00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:55.472]  I agree with you, and that's where I was going to go with this, and I haven't even talked to you yet, but I concur.
[00:47:55.912 --> 00:48:02.899]  This looks like an Israeli cyber attack with this leak of data to try to hurdle us towards World War III.
[00:48:03.817 --> 00:48:11.439]  Oh, and I'll tell ya, I mean, we see the couple that I'm focusing on has been involved intimately with the U.S.
[00:48:11.939 --> 00:48:23.423]  occupation of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, machinations against the Putin government in Russia, machinations against North Korea.
[00:48:24.043 --> 00:48:27.744]  This couple, their names come up time and time again.
[00:48:27.764 --> 00:48:30.405]  Do you still say there's a Soros connection to WikiLeaks?
[00:48:31.065 --> 00:48:36.811]  Absolutely, because in one particular case, one particular U.S.
[00:48:36.931 --> 00:48:47.041]  Embassy, where I know Soros has been very active in Central Asia, figures prominently with this couple, at least one of the members of this
[00:48:49.023 --> 00:49:05.829]  I'm not saying that they're the source of the leak, but I bet you anything if the FBI were to be doing its job, which we know they're not, they're too busy harassing anti-war protesters, I would be focused on this couple.
[00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:15.732]  I would get a panel, a grand jury, and get this couple in there to testify if they're not the source, to find out who is the source.
[00:49:16.392 --> 00:49:18.312]  What's the cell that's operating?
[00:49:18.332 --> 00:49:20.153]  Who are the other members of the cell?
[00:49:20.393 --> 00:49:22.333]  And then we can find out who leaked these cables.
[00:49:22.373 --> 00:49:24.093]  Hillary Clinton can't go there.
[00:49:24.413 --> 00:49:31.295]  She probably knows, but if she utters the I-word, Israel, she can kiss off any future presidential ambition.
[00:49:31.335 --> 00:49:32.555]  She knows the game.
[00:49:32.575 --> 00:49:39.416]  She's very well aware of the game that's being played here, and that's why she looked so frazzled at that news conference yesterday.
[00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:40.716]  Well, let's look at the stratagem.
[00:49:40.756 --> 00:49:42.557]  Let's look at the full-spectrum stratagem.
[00:49:43.057 --> 00:49:44.737]  Key Bono, how does Israel benefit?
[00:49:45.592 --> 00:49:51.778]  Well, Israel benefits because you've got the Arab countries pointing their fingers at each other.
[00:49:51.798 --> 00:49:59.825]  You've got Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States being outed as cooperating with Israel in an attack on Iran.
[00:50:00.266 --> 00:50:02.107]  You know, they're on the same page on that.
[00:50:02.428 --> 00:50:06.111]  You've got Hugo Chavez, Christina Kirschner in Argentina.
[00:50:06.411 --> 00:50:10.175]  All people that Israel doesn't like being made to look bad.
[00:50:10.976 --> 00:50:11.737]  We're good to go.
[00:50:26.679 --> 00:50:38.771]  But we have to realize that the Queen of England does not like George Soros primarily because he has attempted at least twice in the last 20 years to short the British Pound, the Pound Sterling.
[00:50:38.791 --> 00:50:40.633]  They don't like that.
[00:50:41.754 --> 00:50:42.695]  He was behind it.
[00:50:43.155 --> 00:50:47.980]  And Soros has every reason to now retaliate against the British Royals.
[00:50:48.772 --> 00:50:51.437]  And again, I'm not even judging Sanchez himself.
[00:50:51.477 --> 00:50:55.225]  We don't know, but clearly he can just be fed stuff.
[00:50:55.445 --> 00:50:57.509]  Then they try to persecute him to up his cred.
[00:50:57.930 --> 00:50:59.734]  We'll discuss it all on the other side of the Wayne Madsen.
[00:50:59.754 --> 00:51:00.455]  This is Key Intel.
[00:51:01.604 --> 00:51:06.065]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:51:06.265 --> 00:51:14.926]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water filtration systems.

[00:51:59.409 --> 00:52:03.270]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.331 --> 00:52:05.551]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.651 --> 00:52:08.452]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.853 --> 00:52:13.614]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.974 --> 00:52:18.156]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.476 --> 00:52:20.799]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.819 --> 00:52:23.363]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.703 --> 00:52:26.286]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.627 --> 00:52:34.237]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:39.825]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.945 --> 00:52:42.227]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.267 --> 00:52:46.230]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:47.391]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.571 --> 00:52:48.872]  You're everyone else.

[00:54:06.924 --> 00:54:10.526]  Okay, let's go right back to Wayne Madsen, formerly with the National Security Agency.
[00:54:10.566 --> 00:54:12.708]  He's written for many of the biggest publications in the country.
[00:54:13.977 --> 00:54:19.443]  He has a lot of sources and his intel just continues to be staggeringly accurate.
[00:54:20.063 --> 00:54:25.329]  Now, Wayne, I know we're just 48 hours into this really coming out, and...
[00:54:27.062 --> 00:54:29.203]  A lot of things have been happening and going on.
[00:54:29.584 --> 00:54:33.867]  We know if the globalists don't want something of this magnitude coming out, they will send a hit team to kill you.
[00:54:34.467 --> 00:54:40.911]  I don't want to judge Julian Assange without total proof, but the whole thing is very suspicious.
[00:54:41.372 --> 00:54:46.815]  The way this stuff always gets spun towards globalist interests, not U.S.
[00:54:46.875 --> 00:54:47.135]  interests.
[00:54:47.155 --> 00:54:47.596]  The U.S.
[00:54:47.636 --> 00:54:53.860]  folks is just used by this private corporate imperium, and I totally agree, this whole thing helps Israel.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.822]  And you've also got the big banking interest.
[00:54:57.682 --> 00:55:04.205]  That are in so much trouble, that are trying to smokescreen the Europe takeover of Greece and Ireland.
[00:55:05.045 --> 00:55:16.189]  We know the Rand Corporation wants wars, and this thing promotes expanded wars in Pakistan, and destabilizes their government, showing the fishers, and showing how closely their government's working with the US.
[00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:20.771]  It hurts so many allies that are in tenuous situations.
[00:55:21.251 --> 00:55:25.353]  It destabilizes North Korea further, claims the Chinese are ready to cut them loose.
[00:55:26.213 --> 00:55:30.235]  It makes Israel look good, like Israel's wanting to do, you know, deal-swapping land.
[00:55:30.576 --> 00:55:35.718]  It makes it look like all the other Arab allies are the ones that really want to hit Iran.
[00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:37.219]  It ratchets that up.
[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:46.725]  It seconds, you know, all of these fables of, oh, there really are WMDs in Iran, and we want to protect the American people, but we can't.
[00:55:47.025 --> 00:55:51.107]  I mean, this thing really looks like it was written up on a Hollywood set.
[00:55:53.362 --> 00:55:55.964]  Well, not only that, I got something you'll like.
[00:55:56.004 --> 00:55:57.486]  There's a couple I'm focused on.
[00:55:57.546 --> 00:56:01.129]  Both of them are members of the Council on Foreign Relations, okay?
[00:56:01.529 --> 00:56:02.310]  So there we go.
[00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:04.832]  There's the globalist agenda.
[00:56:05.573 --> 00:56:19.245]  I would also note that the National Security Advisor to two former Israeli Prime Ministers, Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert, said that this is beneficial to Israel-speak.
[00:56:19.745 --> 00:56:22.026]  We're the only ones crowing about this right now.
[00:56:22.046 --> 00:56:40.016]  This idea that Bradley Manning walked into a S.C.I.P., a Sensitive Compartment and Information Facility, with a Lady Gaga CD and copied all these, not only these documents, but all those other ones WikiLeaks has released,
[00:56:40.936 --> 00:56:50.200]  And the fact that the New York Times reported yesterday that they did not get these documents directly from WikiLeaks, but got them from an anonymous intermediary.
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:57:00.463]  It's thought that the Guardian did it, but I thought Lamar, the Guardian, Spiegel, and the New York Times were getting these from WikiLeaks.
[00:57:00.563 --> 00:57:05.545]  Now we have Bill Keller, the editor of the New York Times, talking about an anonymous intermediary in New York.
[00:57:05.845 --> 00:57:08.147]  Where is the CFR headquarters located?
[00:57:08.167 --> 00:57:11.709]  It's located in Manhattan, probably not that far away from the New York Times.
[00:57:12.729 --> 00:57:20.094]  We don't know a lot about this yet, but I think we're going to, we're collectively drifting these like Chinese water torture.
[00:57:20.134 --> 00:57:27.399]  Every day we're getting new documents, and then we have a sign saying his next target is going to be a large bank.
[00:57:28.579 --> 00:57:30.561]  There's a feeling that that may be Citibank.
[00:57:32.802 --> 00:57:41.166]  Just like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan targeted Lehman Brothers and others, and that's now come out, we even have the big six banks now waging war on each other.
[00:57:41.467 --> 00:57:53.013]  How did you, six months ago, and then again two months ago, on this show and on your website, Wayne, how did you say, watch, he's going to move into corporate stuff and go after George Soros' competition?
[00:57:53.053 --> 00:57:53.693]  How did you know that?
[00:57:54.324 --> 00:58:02.950]  Well, there's people that I'm talking to that are very suspicious about Assange ever since he may have been co-opted as an Australian hacker.
[00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:10.576]  He never served any jail time with the modus operandi of US and Australian intelligence to co-opt these people.
[00:58:10.676 --> 00:58:12.998]  Also, Mossad did it too with some of their hackers.
[00:58:15.099 --> 00:58:19.323]  What we know about Assange is a lot of his people with WikiLeaks have abandoned him.
[00:58:19.703 --> 00:58:21.564]  There's questions about how he spent the money.
[00:58:21.584 --> 00:58:28.229]  He's got that thing hanging over his head in Sweden with the, with the, um, um, molestation of women.
[00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:33.534]  Uh, I mean, the guy, my feeling is Assange is a useful idiot here.
[00:58:33.574 --> 00:58:36.096]  Yeah, they always use somebody they can destroy at any moment.
[00:58:36.376 --> 00:58:38.297]  Back in 70 Seconds with Lane Madsen.
[00:58:38.317 --> 00:58:39.838]  You don't want to miss this key intel.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:44.142]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.939 --> 00:58:48.234]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:50.745 --> 00:58:54.968]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:55.288 --> 00:58:55.889]  Number 1.
[00:58:56.209 --> 00:58:59.351]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.632 --> 00:59:00.192]  Number 2.
[00:59:00.492 --> 00:59:05.036]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.376 --> 00:59:05.816]  It's true.
[00:59:06.116 --> 00:59:10.680]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:11.540]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.821 --> 00:59:15.103]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.403 --> 00:59:19.106]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:19.306 --> 00:59:19.867]  Number 4.
[00:59:20.107 --> 00:59:22.469]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.869 --> 00:59:26.253]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.553 --> 00:59:26.753]  Number 5.
[00:59:27.334 --> 00:59:31.257]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.477 --> 00:59:36.242]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.522 --> 00:59:40.545]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:59:47.351 --> 00:59:48.692]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.712 --> 00:59:54.656]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.492 --> 01:00:09.693]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:11.134]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.914 --> 01:00:12.834]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.454 --> 01:00:17.135]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:21.717]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.837 --> 01:00:29.841]  Well, Wayne Madsen and Wayne Madsen Report has really been calling it like he sees it and being very accurate in the years we've been interviewing him.
[01:00:30.401 --> 01:00:31.742]  And he's on with us right now.
[01:00:31.762 --> 01:00:33.642]  If you just join us, we're talking about WikiLeaks.
[01:00:34.463 --> 01:00:38.945]  Israel is crowing in many news publications that they're the winners from this.
[01:00:39.505 --> 01:00:45.708]  Just like major Israeli newspapers admitted that, oh yeah, Israel launched the super high-tech worm against
[01:00:47.842 --> 01:00:52.943]  I ran, and oh, now our government, months later, doesn't point out that that's on record.
[01:00:52.963 --> 01:00:57.625]  They say, oh, we've got to take over the web and take your freedoms because of the Stuxnet worm.
[01:00:57.645 --> 01:01:00.065]  And it's the same thing here.
[01:01:00.846 --> 01:01:03.506]  And the big globalist interest and others, they want wars.
[01:01:04.007 --> 01:01:05.367]  They want to go after North Korea.
[01:01:05.387 --> 01:01:07.688]  I'm no fan of North Korea, folks, but we don't need a new war.
[01:01:07.988 --> 01:01:09.008]  The Rand Corporation
[01:01:10.782 --> 01:01:20.325]  Two years ago, told the CFR, you need something bigger than the Iraq War to be able to complete this world government, this corporate world government.
[01:01:20.865 --> 01:01:23.586]  So you notice everything is accelerating right now.
[01:01:23.706 --> 01:01:25.647]  Everything is getting crazier by the day.
[01:01:26.187 --> 01:01:37.730]  And that's because we're entering one of those serious times in history when economies start imploding and the elites are consolidating control, World War I, World War II, and now today, they start major wars.
[01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:39.871]  Wayne Madsen, do you agree with that statement?
[01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:41.247]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:01:41.267 --> 01:01:49.112]  You know, and this isn't the first time the State Department has experienced a cell operating within its own ranks.
[01:01:49.192 --> 01:01:53.934]  We know about Alger Hiss back in the early days of the Cold War.
[01:01:53.954 --> 01:01:55.915]  We know about Felix Bloch in the 1980s.
[01:01:57.336 --> 01:01:59.557]  He was spying for the Soviets.
[01:01:59.577 --> 01:02:01.757]  He was a State Department employee in Vienna.
[01:02:02.357 --> 01:02:05.138]  And we have him operating within the State Department.
[01:02:05.158 --> 01:02:12.700]  This poor PFC Manning, he's a patsy in every sense of the word, just like Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy.
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:16.921]  But we've got these useful idiots like Assange.
[01:02:17.501 --> 01:02:25.849]  And others who are basically pushing the story that all this came from a Lady Gaga CD.
[01:02:26.009 --> 01:02:26.610]  Nonsense.
[01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:28.792]  Whatever goes into it doesn't leave.
[01:02:28.872 --> 01:02:34.077]  If it's a magnetic or optical recording media.
[01:02:34.257 --> 01:02:37.400]  People have told me that nothing has changed on those policies.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.283]  And another thing, if New Zealand started downloading
[01:02:40.863 --> 01:02:43.066]  Well they have alarms on those systems.
[01:02:43.106 --> 01:02:44.828]  That's admitted as you know you work for the NSA.
[01:02:44.848 --> 01:02:45.589]  Absolutely.
[01:02:45.949 --> 01:02:50.975]  I mean they have to go through procedures on each document to even allow the computer to copy it.
[01:03:02.367 --> 01:03:12.035]  Right, so you've got an audit for somebody accessing, and then the minute they start to copy, that's another audit trigger that's tripped.
[01:03:12.475 --> 01:03:15.137]  So the idea that Manning did this is nonsense.
[01:03:16.458 --> 01:03:17.679]  They set this guy up.
[01:03:18.119 --> 01:03:19.621]  I'm not saying he's squeaky clean.
[01:03:19.641 --> 01:03:26.046]  He might have taken a few things out, but he certainly, I don't know how he would have done it without being discovered.
[01:03:28.167 --> 01:03:36.036]  This leak is coming from authorized people within the State Department, people who would have had access to that much information.
[01:03:36.076 --> 01:03:40.200]  We've got cables going back to 1985 all the way up to this year.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:48.830]  This is a tremendous amount of information, but the people who would have had access to it would have had, you know,
[01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:53.532]  Isn't this part of the ongoing program of demonization of the United States?
[01:03:53.792 --> 01:03:58.114]  We're now entering this phase where we're going to be blamed for the world financial meltdown.
[01:03:58.134 --> 01:04:01.336]  I mean, this is the offshore banks preparing us to take the blame.
[01:04:01.946 --> 01:04:02.687]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:04:02.727 --> 01:04:03.067]  You know what?
[01:04:03.428 --> 01:04:07.713]  And I have to say that I can feel for Hillary Clinton right now.
[01:04:07.773 --> 01:04:09.736]  She probably knows what's going on.
[01:04:10.076 --> 01:04:13.460]  But I'll tell you what, pro bono, I would go to the State Department.
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:18.867]  If they give me access there, I can sit there and show them what I've got and who they should be looking at.
[01:04:19.627 --> 01:04:23.969]  Uh, and they're obviously trying to find out where these leaks came from.
[01:04:23.989 --> 01:04:25.830]  I would do that free of charge.
[01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:28.452]  It's only a few miles from where I live here in Washington.
[01:04:28.872 --> 01:04:41.638]  But, you know, they're not going to want me there just like a sponge in an email from some years ago when it was suggested I might be a member of the board of directors of WikiLeaks that, you know, Matt said he might have been good once.
[01:04:41.678 --> 01:04:45.240]  We don't want him now because I would have smelled this guy and it spins out immediately.
[01:04:46.078 --> 01:04:46.459]  Stay there.
[01:04:46.499 --> 01:04:52.128]  Let's cover any other angles and what you think is most important in these leaks.
[01:04:52.308 --> 01:04:56.154]  Then we've got Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America popping in.
[01:04:56.414 --> 01:04:58.678]  They're now arresting people for things that aren't illegal.
[01:04:59.079 --> 01:04:59.519]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.947 --> 01:05:02.549]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[01:07:09.524 --> 01:07:13.826]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[01:07:14.286 --> 01:07:17.607]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.

[01:08:00.902 --> 01:08:05.977]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.338 --> 01:08:08.624]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:12.048 --> 01:08:16.051]  Okay, Wayne Madsen of thewaynemadsenreport.com is our guest, formerly with the NSA.
[01:08:16.671 --> 01:08:22.775]  Just excellent intel up on the hill and at the press club from his other NSA and CIA sources, current and former.
[01:08:23.255 --> 01:08:34.542]  He's been calling WikiLeaks as a George Soros globalist operation for a long time, predicted they would move in against banks and institutions that the globalists want to shut down.
[01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:37.024]  Now Assange has announced that's where they're going next.
[01:08:37.464 --> 01:08:39.966]  Clearly this was not stolen from one military base.
[01:08:40.726 --> 01:08:44.529]  Communiques from the State Department going back a quarter century.
[01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:47.571]  This is really a rigged situation now.
[01:08:47.611 --> 01:08:48.692]  There's no doubt.
[01:08:49.092 --> 01:08:49.793]  And I agree with him.
[01:08:49.853 --> 01:08:51.154]  Assange is a useful idiot.
[01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:55.477]  I don't believe that he's a bad guy.
[01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:56.578]  We don't have evidence of that.
[01:08:56.918 --> 01:09:00.361]  But all of this stuff is clearly propaganda.
[01:09:00.421 --> 01:09:04.123]  And we're going to recap that and get into any other facets of Wayne Madsen here in just a moment.
[01:09:04.664 --> 01:09:05.725]  I got bad news for you.
[01:09:06.667 --> 01:09:18.234]  Two weeks ago, the Food Safety Act, written by big agribusiness, to openly shut down family farms, people even growing their own grapes, their own tomatoes, and selling them to people.
[01:09:18.634 --> 01:09:27.159]  It just gives open-ended, unlimited power for the FDA to just take over and shut down and fine and fee whoever they want.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.742]  Wired Magazine, not Alex Jones.
[01:09:29.842 --> 01:09:38.850]  I mean, I gave you the same analysis months ago, but last week they admitted a web censorship bill sails through committee, and they believe that's going to pass in the lame duck now.
[01:09:39.691 --> 01:09:42.694]  Just like two weeks ago, we said it looks like this bill will now pass.
[01:09:44.537 --> 01:09:46.739]  Because they've got the votes after it went out of committee.
[01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:51.383]  So, Senate passes overhaul of food safety regulations.
[01:09:51.743 --> 01:10:03.914]  They're set to pass, giving the Justice Department unlimited Stalinistic malpower to literally shut down any website, any time, with no proof, no nothing, no judge, no jury, no due process.
[01:10:04.174 --> 01:10:05.155]  That's set to pass.
[01:10:05.455 --> 01:10:07.117]  More banker bailouts set to pass.
[01:10:07.697 --> 01:10:10.498]  They are just destroying this country right now.
[01:10:11.839 --> 01:10:13.900]  We've got to repeal all this coming up in the next session.
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:16.821]  Just because they pass it doesn't mean they're going to be able to implement it.
[01:10:17.261 --> 01:10:18.241]  You can grow dates.
[01:10:18.702 --> 01:10:19.802]  You can grow oranges.
[01:10:19.842 --> 01:10:20.862]  You can grow apples.
[01:10:21.443 --> 01:10:22.723]  You can sell them to your neighbors.
[01:10:22.783 --> 01:10:24.344]  You can slice them up and can them.
[01:10:24.704 --> 01:10:26.185]  The government can't stop you.
[01:10:26.205 --> 01:10:27.125]  This is illegal.
[01:10:27.545 --> 01:10:29.986]  They're criminals, and I don't care what laws they pass.
[01:10:30.286 --> 01:10:33.287]  I'll have any garden I want, and I'll sell it to anybody I want.
[01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:36.649]  And it's big agribusiness that wrote this to shut down their competition.
[01:10:37.489 --> 01:10:40.252]  Senate passes overhaul of food safety regulations.
[01:10:40.532 --> 01:10:51.283]  Despite unusual bipartisan support on Capitol Hill and a strong push from the Obama administration, the bill could still die because there might not be enough time for the usual haggling between Senate and House representatives.
[01:10:51.564 --> 01:10:52.965]  Here's the problem.
[01:10:53.065 --> 01:10:56.349]  That's a New York Times thing to pacify you, okay?
[01:10:57.069 --> 01:10:57.969]  Because here's the bad news.
[01:10:58.009 --> 01:10:58.929]  Here's the Daily Caller.
[01:10:59.189 --> 01:11:01.430]  Hot Mike picks up discussion on Senate floor.
[01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:03.190]  Quote, it's all rigged.
[01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:04.450]  Hot Mike left on.
[01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:05.530]  This just came out minutes ago.
[01:11:06.071 --> 01:11:07.231]  Senate vote Tuesday.
[01:11:07.291 --> 01:11:08.851]  This is going up on InfoWars right now.
[01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:14.052]  Hot Mike left on during a Senate vote Tuesday morning on the Food Safety Act.
[01:11:14.332 --> 01:11:20.493]  Caught a Senator complaining that the process of setting the agenda during the lame duck session is rigged.
[01:11:21.033 --> 01:11:25.754]  And it was Senator from Colorado, Democrat Senator Michael Bennett talking to Lieberman
[01:11:26.394 --> 01:11:28.035]  And they've never done this before.
[01:11:28.736 --> 01:11:32.358]  They're doing things in procedural rules now where it is a dictatorship.
[01:11:32.638 --> 01:11:34.799]  There's no debate on any of this stuff.
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:43.325]  We're going to go to Wayne in a minute, but here's the short clip of Democratic Senator from Colorado, Senator Michael Bennett, saying it's all rigged.
[01:11:44.005 --> 01:11:45.446]  It's just all being rammed through.
[01:11:45.706 --> 01:11:46.147]  Here it is.
[01:11:46.807 --> 01:11:50.591]  There's nothing about it, because it's all rigged.
[01:11:50.671 --> 01:11:53.633]  I mean, the whole conversation is rigged.
[01:11:53.693 --> 01:12:00.319]  The fact that we don't get to a discussion before the break about what we're going to do in the lame duck is just rigged.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:01.681]  This stuff's rigged.
[01:12:05.944 --> 01:12:07.085]  This stuff's rigged.
[01:12:07.486 --> 01:12:08.667]  This stuff is rigged.
[01:12:09.007 --> 01:12:10.749]  Wayne Madsen, what's your take on that?
[01:12:11.664 --> 01:12:12.684]  Oh, of course it's rigged.
[01:12:12.724 --> 01:12:17.226]  Look, this is what a lame duck Congress is doing.
[01:12:17.246 --> 01:12:20.227]  Where's Obama?
[01:12:20.868 --> 01:12:27.670]  He's busy playing basketball at Fort McNair and getting elbowed or hit by a fist.
[01:12:28.951 --> 01:12:37.774]  Now we've got the Weekly Standard, certainly not one of my favorite magazines, reporting this week that this guy suffers from a narcissistic
[01:12:39.195 --> 01:12:54.208]  I mean, this guy loves the attention, but he doesn't want to do the job of being the President of the United States, which is more than just going out and getting applauded and, you know, high-fiving it with people out there on the campaign trail.
[01:12:54.909 --> 01:13:00.534]  Being President, it takes a lot more than just being a darn television celebrity.
[01:13:01.053 --> 01:13:01.853]  Absolutely.
[01:13:02.054 --> 01:13:03.574]  We've only got a minute or two left.
[01:13:04.055 --> 01:13:08.837]  Wayne, any other leads you're working on on the WikiLeaks mega fiasco?
[01:13:09.377 --> 01:13:15.000]  Well, I want to point out on Manning, remember the guy that turned him in was a WikiLeaks guy named Adrian Lammo.
[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:17.721]  He turned him in to the FBI.
[01:13:17.781 --> 01:13:22.144]  Here we have like a smoking gun on setting this poor guy up.
[01:13:22.304 --> 01:13:24.145]  The leaks didn't come from him.
[01:13:24.205 --> 01:13:26.546]  They're from inside the State Department.
[01:13:27.466 --> 01:13:31.968]  I worked in computer security at the State Department and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security.
[01:13:32.488 --> 01:13:42.632]  I know that to get that much information out there, if it's valid, and probably a lot of it is, we don't know how many of these digital documents may have been altered or forged.
[01:13:43.072 --> 01:13:49.036]  But that takes somebody at a very high level within the State Department.
[01:13:49.216 --> 01:13:50.057]  That's the source.
[01:13:50.137 --> 01:13:51.798]  That's where the FBI should be looking.
[01:13:52.198 --> 01:13:54.900]  That's where the Justice Department should be looking.
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:14:00.384]  But don't think Eric Holder, the Attorney General, is going to look to where the real criminals are.
[01:14:00.664 --> 01:14:07.889]  He's nothing more than a front man for these people, just like his boss, Barack Obama, is.
[01:14:08.129 --> 01:14:18.077]  And just like the director of the FBI, in fact, it came out that the current head of the Justice Department was the instrumental front man as Deputy Attorney General with the Oklahoma City cover-up.
[01:14:18.337 --> 01:14:19.819]  Wayne Madsen, thank you for the report.
[01:14:19.859 --> 01:14:20.960]  We'll talk to you again very soon.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:21.760]  You bet.
[01:14:22.101 --> 01:14:23.121]  All right, there's Wayne Madsen.
[01:14:23.161 --> 01:14:30.087]  I tend to agree with everything he's saying, and he's got the intel sources, and what he talks about continues to be borne out over and over again.
[01:14:30.107 --> 01:14:32.209]  I wanted to briefly get
[01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:39.279]  Larry Pratt on from Gun Owners of America today, up at philly.com.
[01:14:40.739 --> 01:14:44.822]  Family, New Jersey man serving seven years for guns he owned legally.
[01:14:46.192 --> 01:14:47.954]  And I see these kind of reports all the time.
[01:14:47.974 --> 01:14:51.297]  The guy had gotten divorced.
[01:14:51.337 --> 01:14:52.738]  His wife wouldn't let him see his kids.
[01:14:52.758 --> 01:14:55.181]  He was a professional guy with no criminal record.
[01:14:55.681 --> 01:14:56.962]  He was staying at his mom's house.
[01:14:57.002 --> 01:14:59.084]  He said, oh, is life even worth living?
[01:14:59.425 --> 01:15:00.666]  He didn't threaten to commit suicide.
[01:15:01.066 --> 01:15:01.947]  She calls the police.
[01:15:01.987 --> 01:15:05.871]  They come, SWAT team, find two guns in his car in the trunk legally.
[01:15:05.891 --> 01:15:07.192]  He gets seven years in prison.
[01:15:07.993 --> 01:15:08.673]  Here's another one.
[01:15:08.994 --> 01:15:09.874]  Obama nominates
[01:15:10.775 --> 01:15:15.359]  Rabid anti-gunner to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives.
[01:15:15.679 --> 01:15:17.100]  That's from Gun Owners of America.
[01:15:17.961 --> 01:15:19.802]  That's a report out there.
[01:15:20.542 --> 01:15:27.047]  So I wanted to briefly look at this ongoing march against the Second Amendment.
[01:15:27.928 --> 01:15:30.009]  But I see these cases every few weeks without even looking.
[01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:34.273]  I'll see an article out of New Jersey or Massachusetts or California.
[01:15:35.173 --> 01:15:39.016]  You see them where it's almost always a carpet cleaner or a neighbor or a plumber.
[01:15:40.357 --> 01:15:44.721]  It's almost always some old vet with no criminal record, done nothing wrong, volunteers locally.
[01:15:44.801 --> 01:15:51.807]  I've seen a lot of cases where they're tinkering in their garage, cleaning guns, or a deer hunter's putting a gun in their truck to go hunting.
[01:15:52.368 --> 01:15:58.453]  And you hear about them getting SWAT teamed and they'll report the guns were legal but they've been confiscated and they've been charged with an arsenal.
[01:15:59.074 --> 01:16:00.315]  And then they never even have a law.
[01:16:00.395 --> 01:16:01.075]  What's an arsenal?
[01:16:01.416 --> 01:16:05.039]  I've seen as little as two or three guns and a thousand rounds of ammo called an arsenal.
[01:16:06.707 --> 01:16:11.532]  I mean this is just incredible that this type of thing is going on.
[01:16:12.253 --> 01:16:24.066]  And it's another example of people doing nothing wrong, but the juries are so stupid that they will charge you with something totally separate from what the supposed crime even is.
[01:16:25.396 --> 01:16:30.758]  And they do this over and over and over and over again.
[01:16:30.938 --> 01:16:33.099]  If we can't get Pratt on ISDN, let's just do telephone.
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:33.980]  No big deal.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:34.980]  No big deal.
[01:16:35.701 --> 01:16:37.041]  Okay, continuing here.
[01:16:37.141 --> 01:16:40.783]  Obama nominates rabid anti-gunner to head the ATF.
[01:16:41.944 --> 01:16:57.556]  It was not a good sign that Barack Obama kept his nominee to head the BATF, Firearms and Explosives, a secret unit after the midterm election, and then quickly announced that the anti-gun zealot, Andrew F. Traver, would be named to fill the slot.
[01:16:58.422 --> 01:17:13.066]  After being blasted before the November election by the liberal New York Times for failing to beef up the ATF by appointing a director for fear of the wrath of the gun lobby, Obama gets right past the election and presto, change-o, a nominee appears.
[01:17:13.126 --> 01:17:13.886]  How about that?
[01:17:14.187 --> 01:17:17.728]  And not just any nominee, a special agent in charge of Chicago.
[01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:21.809]  It's almost always some old 80-something-year-old.
[01:17:21.849 --> 01:17:23.310]  I see it all the time, literally.
[01:17:24.010 --> 01:17:26.031]  In fact, there have been a lot of cases.
[01:17:26.071 --> 01:17:29.952]  Old World War II vets won't renew their gun card.
[01:17:29.972 --> 01:17:30.873]  You've got to get it every year.
[01:17:31.093 --> 01:17:31.873]  And they SWAT team them.
[01:17:32.353 --> 01:17:34.494]  They don't call them and say, hey, come do this, or give them a ticket.
[01:17:34.995 --> 01:17:35.955]  No, they SWAT team them.
[01:17:36.395 --> 01:17:38.176]  And the feds run all that through the state police.
[01:17:38.596 --> 01:17:47.480]  A special agent in charge of the Chicago's ATF, that's the most vicious in the country, field division, Traver, had taken the lead in calling for a ban on semi-automatic rifles, period.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.901]  Not just you can't sell them anymore, you've got to turn them in.
[01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:58.363]  I mean, they're now appointing somebody who openly wants your guns and wants your guns now.
[01:17:59.223 --> 01:18:00.723]  We're going to go to Larry Pratt now.
[01:18:00.783 --> 01:18:04.284]  Larry Pratt, head of Gun Owners of America, GunOwners.org.
[01:18:04.324 --> 01:18:05.245]  Great to have you on, sir.
[01:18:05.665 --> 01:18:06.625]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[01:18:06.665 --> 01:18:07.205]  Thanks so much.
[01:18:07.365 --> 01:18:07.605]  You bet.
[01:18:07.625 --> 01:18:13.867]  We're going to break in a minute, but let's cover this new nominee, just absolutely anti-Second Amendment.
[01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:15.410]  Absolutely.
[01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:31.156]  One of the clearest ways we know is that while he was out in the Chicago office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, he attended and participated in a Great Lakes State Summit on Firearms Violence.
[01:18:31.636 --> 01:18:42.760]  They produced a document, Taking a Stand, Reducing Gun Violence in Our Communities, and it's a list that the Brady campaign would be just very happy
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:49.963]  No more anonymous sales so the government will know everybody who bought a gun and what kind of a gun.
[01:18:49.983 --> 01:18:52.625]  In other words, he's for gun registration.
[01:18:53.745 --> 01:18:55.066]  We have too much of it as it is.
[01:18:55.466 --> 01:19:02.490]  When we go to a dealer, this would eliminate private sales, and that's something the Brady campaign's been after for a long time.
[01:19:03.130 --> 01:19:08.713]  In this report, they wanted to get rid of our semi-automatic, to basically redo the Clinton gun ban.
[01:19:09.314 --> 01:19:12.685]  And that means Grandpa can't give grandson a 22 when he's 10.
[01:19:14.682 --> 01:19:15.923]  Under that transfer law.
[01:19:16.403 --> 01:19:17.023]  Absolutely.
[01:19:17.444 --> 01:19:21.786]  If my neighbor says, hey, I really like that shotgun, I can't sell it to him.
[01:19:22.447 --> 01:19:23.587]  I have to go through a dealer.
[01:19:24.087 --> 01:19:26.149]  And then the record is established.
[01:19:26.489 --> 01:19:36.234]  You know, there's nothing in our Constitution that says the government, the federal government, has authority in the area of regulating firearms.
[01:19:36.254 --> 01:19:40.537]  In fact, the Second Amendment's pretty clear that it shall not be infringed.
[01:19:40.917 --> 01:19:42.178]  And the Tenth Amendment makes it even
[01:19:43.217 --> 01:19:45.058]  Larry, we've only got one more segment with you.
[01:19:45.118 --> 01:19:45.458]  Stay there.
[01:19:45.478 --> 01:19:51.161]  We're going to come back, get your breakdown on how to stop this anti-Second Amendment victim disarmament pimp.
[01:19:51.862 --> 01:19:56.044]  Then we will get into people going to jail for legal guns.
[01:19:56.824 --> 01:19:57.504]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:19:57.564 --> 01:19:58.245]  InfoWars.com.
[01:20:01.232 --> 01:20:04.515]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:05.336 --> 01:20:09.560]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:15.766]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:15.986 --> 01:20:18.128]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:18.428 --> 01:20:24.394]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:24.514 --> 01:20:27.837]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:29.619]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:29.799 --> 01:20:31.841]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:31.981 --> 01:20:36.646]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.

[01:20:46.776 --> 01:20:47.877]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[01:20:47.897 --> 01:20:48.638]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[01:21:00.703 --> 01:21:03.025]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:21:03.085 --> 01:21:05.287]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:05.407 --> 01:21:08.209]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:13.373]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:13.734 --> 01:21:17.917]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:21:18.217 --> 01:21:20.558]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:21:20.578 --> 01:21:23.099]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:21:23.459 --> 01:21:26.040]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:21:26.361 --> 01:21:33.964]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:21:34.301 --> 01:21:39.566]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:21:39.706 --> 01:21:41.989]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:21:42.549 --> 01:21:45.992]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:21:46.253 --> 01:21:47.154]  And I got news for you.
[01:21:47.314 --> 01:21:48.635]  You're everyone else.
[01:21:48.655 --> 01:21:49.656]  Invisible Empire.

[01:22:29.622 --> 01:22:30.683]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:35.246]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:35.426 --> 01:22:41.150]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:44.652]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:44.892 --> 01:22:47.494]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:23:09.246 --> 01:23:10.186]  My name is Crystal.
[01:23:10.546 --> 01:23:13.147]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:23:13.487 --> 01:23:17.108]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:23:17.449 --> 01:23:21.410]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:22.391]  What did Crystal do?
[01:23:22.411 --> 01:23:26.055]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:32.663]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.

[01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:05.651]  I think that a parasitic dream will never come back.
[01:24:05.671 --> 01:24:09.112]  It painted my hands and my face blue.
[01:24:09.272 --> 01:24:12.013]  And suddenly the wind quickly took me away.
[01:24:12.033 --> 01:24:14.915]  And made me fly in the infinite sky.
[01:24:15.015 --> 01:24:15.115]  Fly!
[01:24:30.985 --> 01:24:38.813]  Okay, we only have about five minutes with Larry Pratt, and I'm getting into the economy, the censorship against PrisonPlanet.com, what's happening in North Korea.
[01:24:38.913 --> 01:24:53.207]  Larry, let's get into this individual, how we keep him from becoming the new head of the ATF, and also this report that's getting so much attention, mainstream news, New Jersey man serving seven years for guns he owned legally.
[01:24:54.727 --> 01:25:07.798]  Well, for stopping this guy, Traver, I'm not sure that we're going to have the ability to do that, because it looks as if Obama is going to use a recess appointment, and that would enable him to serve basically for all of 2011.
[01:25:08.318 --> 01:25:20.088]  Of course, if the Congress does away with the BATF, that would take care of Mr. Traver's problem, and he could go and maybe find a job as a real cop.
[01:25:22.094 --> 01:25:31.643]  Now, the guy in New Jersey, it's really an extremely infuriating thing that they would even bring a charge.
[01:25:31.903 --> 01:25:35.907]  Here's a guy that went out of his way to find out what the law was.
[01:25:35.967 --> 01:25:44.936]  He was moving to the state from Colorado, where there's a relative amount of freedom regarding the Second Amendment, and he was
[01:25:46.984 --> 01:25:56.189]  In the process of getting all the paperwork done in Jersey, but he didn't have a permit to own the gun.
[01:25:57.149 --> 01:26:02.832]  And that's what they nailed him on, even though he wasn't robbing a bank, he wasn't doing anything wrong.
[01:26:03.292 --> 01:26:04.533]  It's just that in New Jersey,
[01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:12.334]  They don't like you having a gun unless they know you bought the gun because you have a firearms owner identification certificate.
[01:26:12.954 --> 01:26:21.798]  And for that, that alone, he's going to serve more time if the governor doesn't grant him clemency than a lot of people that commit murder.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.041]  Continue.
[01:26:26.441 --> 01:26:32.704]  It is something that I think people can have, something we can do in the case of New Jersey because
[01:26:33.251 --> 01:26:40.774]  But there we could contact Governor Christie and Trenton and urge him to give this guy clemency.
[01:26:42.974 --> 01:27:00.600]  And I think Christie, who's not pro-Second Amendment, but I think he might well respond to an obvious... I mean, what good is society getting out of paying for this guy's incarceration for seven years when he didn't harm anybody?
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.721]  He didn't commit any real crime.
[01:27:03.453 --> 01:27:08.615]  So I think contacting Governor Chris Christie, Trenton, New Jersey, is the way to go.
[01:27:10.075 --> 01:27:18.758]  I've also, in closing, seen an intensification by the Justice Department claiming that all the violence in Mexico is caused by our Second Amendment.
[01:27:19.178 --> 01:27:21.679]  But then I've actually looked at the Justice Department's own numbers.
[01:27:22.179 --> 01:27:24.940]  They admit that most of the weapons being used by drug cartels
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.340]  I mean, it's incredible, Larry, how they spin this.
[01:27:47.486 --> 01:27:59.791]  We have a country with a total gun ban for citizens, it's a lawless hellhole, 28,000 dead in the last two years, and the government tries to ban our Second Amendment, claiming that it's causing problems in Mexico.
[01:28:00.997 --> 01:28:09.219]  The idea that a grenade launcher is something that, well, you just walk into the gun show and I'll take two of those, I'm on my way down to Mexico.
[01:28:09.239 --> 01:28:11.440]  It doesn't work that way.
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:19.322]  This is not something that's available to people, certainly not readily, and the paperwork that would entail would be enormous.
[01:28:20.303 --> 01:28:21.044]  It doesn't happen.
[01:28:22.286 --> 01:28:32.602]  As you say, it's coming mostly from the Mexican military, and my guess is that if it's not being sold out of their armories directly, it comes when some 150,000 men have deserted the Mexican army.
[01:28:35.826 --> 01:28:45.768]  And the idea that they would have to work on a onesie twosie gun up for the drug warriors when they got airplanes flying in drugs right now.
[01:28:46.048 --> 01:28:50.149]  Don't think there's any room in there for a case or two of AKs?
[01:28:50.409 --> 01:28:50.849]  Come on!
[01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:56.910]  500 billion dollars a year is estimated to be brought through heroin, cocaine and marijuana out of Mexico alone.
[01:28:57.270 --> 01:29:00.891]  If they're making a big cut of 500 bill, you think they can buy a few weapons?
[01:29:02.831 --> 01:29:04.552]  I think they could probably do it.
[01:29:04.572 --> 01:29:05.492]  And you know what, Alex?
[01:29:05.572 --> 01:29:07.273]  I think they would do it for cash.
[01:29:08.434 --> 01:29:08.994]  No records.
[01:29:09.834 --> 01:29:13.396]  Well, I mean, if they're already going to fly in cocaine, of course they're going to fly in weapons.
[01:29:13.876 --> 01:29:17.577]  You and I go to a store, and we get all registered up.
[01:29:18.538 --> 01:29:20.398]  So we might as well use our credit card.
[01:29:20.438 --> 01:29:22.479]  When they do it, no records, no questions.
[01:29:22.719 --> 01:29:23.340]  Here's the cash.
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:24.200]  Everybody's happy.
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:27.943]  Yeah, why couldn't we buy a gun the same way a crook can?
[01:29:28.103 --> 01:29:30.005]  There's something wrong with this... Exactly!
[01:29:30.105 --> 01:29:32.047]  Crooks aren't going to follow the law.
[01:29:32.067 --> 01:29:33.048]  Get rid of all the laws.
[01:29:33.088 --> 01:29:35.810]  GunOwners.org, folks who signed up there with the free email list.
[01:29:36.190 --> 01:29:38.693]  A true patriot organization defending the Second Amendment.
[01:29:38.973 --> 01:29:40.074]  God bless you, Larry Pratt.
[01:29:40.114 --> 01:29:40.874]  You too, Alex.
[01:29:41.115 --> 01:29:41.515]  Take care.
[01:29:41.535 --> 01:29:43.717]  We'll be right back with a ton of vital news.
[01:29:44.117 --> 01:29:46.499]  More on the food safety bill past the Senate.
[01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:48.801]  And they're coming after your farm and ranch.
[01:29:48.841 --> 01:29:49.202]  Get ready.
[01:29:50.933 --> 01:29:53.943]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.866 --> 01:29:57.555]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.765 --> 01:30:04.208]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:08.632]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:30:08.872 --> 01:30:13.516]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:30:13.536 --> 01:30:18.760]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:30:19.521 --> 01:30:22.704]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:30:23.184 --> 01:30:26.567]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:30:29.284 --> 01:30:33.706]  I'm looking for America.
[01:30:34.827 --> 01:30:36.247]  We're American and be proud.
[01:30:36.467 --> 01:30:38.568]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:30:38.608 --> 01:30:43.250]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:47.432]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:30:55.269 --> 01:30:59.846]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:31:00.472 --> 01:31:04.695]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:05.015 --> 01:31:05.615]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.936 --> 01:31:09.078]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.358 --> 01:31:09.918]  Number 2.
[01:31:10.219 --> 01:31:14.762]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:15.102 --> 01:31:15.542]  It's true.
[01:31:15.842 --> 01:31:20.405]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.726 --> 01:31:21.266]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.546 --> 01:31:24.828]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.128 --> 01:31:28.831]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.031 --> 01:31:29.592]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.832 --> 01:31:32.194]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.595 --> 01:31:35.978]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.279 --> 01:31:36.479]  Number 5.
[01:31:37.059 --> 01:31:40.984]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.224 --> 01:31:45.969]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.249 --> 01:31:50.275]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.435 --> 01:31:51.997]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:52.218 --> 01:31:54.301]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:31:54.481 --> 01:31:56.824]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:01.155 --> 01:32:15.622]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:32:16.623 --> 01:32:20.305]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:21.314 --> 01:32:33.324]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:32:34.065 --> 01:32:41.330]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:32:42.031 --> 01:32:51.636]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:32:52.397 --> 01:32:55.678]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:32:56.319 --> 01:32:59.521]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:33:03.463 --> 01:33:11.147]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:15.387 --> 01:33:17.207]  Well, here's some of the news we've got.
[01:33:17.267 --> 01:33:21.508]  Climate alarmists push for forced relocation at Cancun Summit.
[01:33:21.928 --> 01:33:24.149]  We've now gotten a detailed report out on this.
[01:33:24.169 --> 01:33:42.532]  I've been covering it in the last few weeks and showing you the report itself, but now Watson has written a detailed article at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com ahead of the attempt to set up the global carbon tax world government regime, now kicking off in a few days, just two days from now, in Mexico, running for almost two weeks.
[01:33:43.092 --> 01:33:44.813]  Now, that report is at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:44.853 --> 01:33:49.114]  It's also at GCNLive.com.
[01:33:49.755 --> 01:34:05.581]  GCNLive.com, which is the network site, but more and more we're using it as an auxiliary, because just because Google's banned Prison Planet and now InfoWars from Google News Feeds, when you click on, you know, Google and click News and search our headlines, you can't get them going back two weeks.
[01:34:06.021 --> 01:34:11.103]  Not only are they trying right now to shut down our channel and openly telling us that on YouTube,
[01:34:11.977 --> 01:34:14.701]  With millions of views a week, 75 million views so far.
[01:34:16.063 --> 01:34:18.786]  Of the other channels, over 230 million in the last two years.
[01:34:18.826 --> 01:34:19.527]  That's conservative.
[01:34:19.547 --> 01:34:21.730]  I've been saying 200 million for six months.
[01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:23.092]  It's well over 230 million.
[01:34:23.853 --> 01:34:25.936]  So, all of that is happening.
[01:34:27.377 --> 01:34:29.578]  And it's because we're covering real issues.
[01:34:29.618 --> 01:34:43.604]  So I would add for Aaron, let's make sure we have it posted at GCNlive.com so that even though Google's gonna, when people search it and find out that the number one search term today, thanks to our great listeners who've never failed,
[01:34:44.104 --> 01:34:46.305]  We'll be Google, Blacklist, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:46.325 --> 01:34:49.066]  Those terms together, we're shooting to have that number one.
[01:34:49.246 --> 01:34:51.107]  Then they'll find GCNlive.com.
[01:34:51.827 --> 01:34:54.849]  Even though Google has blocked us, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[01:34:55.849 --> 01:34:58.330]  Also, teacher bans pencils from class.
[01:34:58.710 --> 01:35:00.251]  Cited potential weapon making.
[01:35:00.771 --> 01:35:05.995]  Most school districts first banned dodgeball, then running, now shaking hands, touching.
[01:35:06.975 --> 01:35:10.178]  The children are learning how to be prisoners in a maximum security facility.
[01:35:10.598 --> 01:35:12.639]  That's at GCNlive.com.
[01:35:12.719 --> 01:35:15.942]  Canada surrenders sovereignty and privacy to U.S.
[01:35:16.002 --> 01:35:17.143]  Secure Flight Program.
[01:35:17.463 --> 01:35:21.346]  That's from Be Your Own Leader, also posted at GCNlive.com.
[01:35:22.026 --> 01:35:29.431]  Hot Mike picks up discussion on Senate floor about how everything is rigged, dealing with the Senate passing today.
[01:35:32.405 --> 01:35:34.252]  No safety in food, Bill.
[01:35:34.313 --> 01:35:37.165]  They call it the Food Safety Act.
[01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:47.073]  The food safety regulations really were written by a big agribusiness who causes the lion's share of food poisonings with salmonella and other problems.
[01:35:47.113 --> 01:35:47.793]  That's on record.
[01:35:48.273 --> 01:35:49.434]  And it's just so draconian.
[01:35:49.454 --> 01:35:53.495]  I want to be covering some of that coming up.
[01:35:54.315 --> 01:35:58.697]  But again, I just briefly wanted to remind folks, this is big news.
[01:35:59.597 --> 01:36:02.178]  And we got the email from the official
[01:36:03.046 --> 01:36:04.508]  In fact, I'm looking for the email now.
[01:36:05.068 --> 01:36:09.013]  Well, we can put it back up on screen for viewers so I can read it as well.
[01:36:09.033 --> 01:36:11.295]  In fact, just put back up on screen for me, guys.
[01:36:11.616 --> 01:36:17.282]  Google blacklistprisonplanet.com and when you scroll down, you can see the email to our channel.
[01:36:18.563 --> 01:36:20.283]  And we saw this last night.
[01:36:20.804 --> 01:36:25.224]  It actually came in yesterday morning, but Aaron saw it last night at about 7.
[01:36:25.604 --> 01:36:28.905]  I was still here at the office and he notified me and I went back there and read it.
[01:36:30.265 --> 01:36:35.666]  And sometimes it takes a day, usually it's a few hours, for them to shut down or lock down a channel.
[01:36:35.706 --> 01:36:36.587]  It has not happened yet.
[01:36:37.007 --> 01:36:43.708]  And so I ran in here at about 8 at night, shot a five-minute video breaking down the fact that they told us, hey look,
[01:36:46.148 --> 01:36:56.216]  You showed a short clip, by the way we put this video up over six months ago, of the Apache helicopter shooting up the Reuters reporter in the minivan.
[01:36:56.896 --> 01:36:59.158]  They're like little black dots down the street being shot.
[01:36:59.198 --> 01:37:01.159]  I mean, it's nothing.
[01:37:02.541 --> 01:37:06.563]  And we countered back to them saying you're going to do this to our channel.
[01:37:07.765 --> 01:37:11.911]  And we counter claimed and said this is on Al Jazeera, this is on CNN, this is ABC, CBS.
[01:37:12.172 --> 01:37:15.116]  I mean there's literally hundreds of news agencies with the whole video!
[01:37:15.837 --> 01:37:16.799]  And they blew it up!
[01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:20.003]  I talk about the video and go look at the troops!
[01:37:21.465 --> 01:37:22.145]  Look at the troops.
[01:37:22.225 --> 01:37:29.308]  The troops on the ground go and save the wounded children, and point out that this was wrong, and then the helicopter pilots make jokes about it.
[01:37:29.868 --> 01:37:37.270]  And I said, that shows how they're removed from the death, but the troops that are actually seeing the kids, you know, all shot up, they have humanity.
[01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:40.231]  And I just said, shame on those helicopter pilots.
[01:37:40.691 --> 01:37:42.572]  That's why they banned the video.
[01:37:43.834 --> 01:37:47.615]  We had the video banned where I showed the puppy being thrown off the cliff by the troops.
[01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:49.956]  All the other news agencies were allowed to have it.
[01:37:50.076 --> 01:37:53.277]  We couldn't have it because we pointed out how we're dehumanized.
[01:37:53.517 --> 01:37:57.358]  People don't feel empathy when they see humans being killed, but they got upset about dogs.
[01:37:58.518 --> 01:38:00.238]  My issue wasn't really about the troops.
[01:38:00.318 --> 01:38:01.839]  It was about the psychology.
[01:38:04.224 --> 01:38:08.508]  We had a problem with that a few years ago, so I just remembered that we had this happen before.
[01:38:08.888 --> 01:38:10.269]  So, they use anything.
[01:38:10.309 --> 01:38:11.770]  They white glove inspect us.
[01:38:12.731 --> 01:38:14.693]  Other people's, you know, things can be a pigsty.
[01:38:15.093 --> 01:38:15.914]  We do anything.
[01:38:15.954 --> 01:38:17.035]  They're moving to shut us down.
[01:38:17.195 --> 01:38:18.115]  It could happen anytime.
[01:38:19.537 --> 01:38:20.898]  They might shut it down completely.
[01:38:20.938 --> 01:38:22.599]  They said they might just freeze it for two weeks.
[01:38:23.079 --> 01:38:27.143]  Show that millions of people, every week, that get their news off that can't get it.
[01:38:28.684 --> 01:38:32.346]  Quite frankly, that will just make us make more money, but that's not my goal.
[01:38:33.347 --> 01:38:41.492]  PrisonPlanet.tv members know that almost everything that goes on PrisonPlanet.tv, then a week or so later, goes on our channels.
[01:38:41.532 --> 01:38:49.917]  Sure, you get it in higher quality, you get it all in one place, you get books, you get other films we're not authorized to put on YouTube, other people's films that authorize us to post it on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:38:51.738 --> 01:38:55.920]  $5.95 a month, it's really just like a donation to help pay for the bandwidth and pay for the rest of the operation.
[01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:56.601]  We appreciate you.
[01:38:56.801 --> 01:38:58.982]  But everybody knows you can get it on the Alex Jones Channel.
[01:38:59.642 --> 01:39:07.585]  And our listeners lovingly support PrisonPlanet.tv to get it first, to get it in one spot, but also to support us.
[01:39:08.106 --> 01:39:12.888]  So, shutting down our channel, which we hope doesn't happen, because our goal is to get the word out,
[01:39:14.076 --> 01:39:17.779]  All that's going to do is make tens of thousands of people come sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:21.562]  So, you know, God turns every attack into a blessing.
[01:39:21.863 --> 01:39:23.764]  No weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[01:39:24.325 --> 01:39:27.047]  And I, you know, reading that in Sunday school as a little kid, I didn't understand it.
[01:39:27.347 --> 01:39:35.575]  But in my life, every time bad things happen to us and I just continue and don't back down, other doors open that are even bigger and better to get the word out.
[01:39:35.615 --> 01:39:36.575]  We are so blessed.
[01:39:36.796 --> 01:39:38.117]  We are having such a huge effect.
[01:39:38.197 --> 01:39:40.239]  It is so wonderful and I am thankful.
[01:39:41.389 --> 01:39:42.209]  I am thankful.
[01:39:42.349 --> 01:39:46.190]  I am appreciative of you, the listeners, and everything we've done together.
[01:39:46.410 --> 01:39:48.371]  But I want to hit Google and hit them hard today.
[01:39:48.871 --> 01:39:52.632]  I want to make one search term, Google Blacklist Prison Planet dot com.
[01:39:52.872 --> 01:39:53.592]  Those three words.
[01:39:53.852 --> 01:39:55.593]  Google Blast Prison Planet dot com.
[01:39:56.353 --> 01:39:58.774]  Put it into the search engine over and over again right now, folks.
[01:39:58.814 --> 01:39:59.574]  Don't count on others.
[01:40:00.214 --> 01:40:05.976]  But I also want to make... I want to make another search term, number one.
[01:40:06.946 --> 01:40:08.727]  And that's Google is evil.
[01:40:09.208 --> 01:40:10.589]  Their motto is don't be evil.
[01:40:11.309 --> 01:40:12.950]  Well, Google is evil.
[01:40:15.192 --> 01:40:16.252]  They disguise themselves.
[01:40:16.292 --> 01:40:17.853]  They are an NSA CIA front.
[01:40:17.873 --> 01:40:22.777]  We told you that six years ago with former CIA intel officers, experts in technology we had on.
[01:40:22.837 --> 01:40:23.877]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:40:24.558 --> 01:40:29.181]  And they're there in 11 years gobbling up the entire web, taking over the entire internet.
[01:40:29.561 --> 01:40:30.622]  And I'm not going to put up with it.
[01:40:30.642 --> 01:40:32.884]  And I'm asking listeners to take our article,
[01:40:33.564 --> 01:40:45.746]  To cover what's in it, to take snippets of the video or the whole video I posted while our channel's still there, and to get it out to everyone, and to make your own YouTube videos about them censoring PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:40:45.946 --> 01:40:46.686]  They are probing.
[01:40:46.706 --> 01:40:47.486]  They are testing us.
[01:40:47.706 --> 01:40:49.107]  They are trying to wear us out.
[01:40:49.347 --> 01:40:56.788]  They're trying to always attack every few months so you get sick of hearing about it and just, oh, that's what they're going to do, and start just giving in and thinking it's a foregone conclusion.
[01:40:56.988 --> 01:40:58.368]  This is psychological warfare.
[01:40:58.648 --> 01:41:02.089]  You've got to say, not only are we going to fight you, we like fighting you!
[01:41:02.429 --> 01:41:02.949]  Come on!
[01:41:02.989 --> 01:41:03.710]  Give me more!
[01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:04.350]  I like it!
[01:41:06.191 --> 01:41:07.652]  They can't beat that spirit, folks.
[01:41:07.672 --> 01:41:08.692]  Resistance is victory.
[01:41:08.852 --> 01:41:09.673]  The globalists know that.
[01:41:09.693 --> 01:41:12.234]  That's why they're all hyped up, they're arrogant, they never stop.
[01:41:12.534 --> 01:41:15.996]  But when you keep pushing and don't stop, they get scared.
[01:41:17.676 --> 01:41:18.277]  I'm weak!
[01:41:18.297 --> 01:41:19.958]  Help me!
[01:41:20.278 --> 01:41:21.678]  Look, we've got the power.
[01:41:22.179 --> 01:41:23.699]  We are in the right.
[01:41:26.035 --> 01:41:26.555]  Don't stop.
[01:41:27.236 --> 01:41:27.736]  Don't stop.
[01:41:27.776 --> 01:41:28.397]  Don't ever stop.
[01:41:28.437 --> 01:41:35.342]  But Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, there is no doubt they are at the tip of the spear.
[01:41:35.922 --> 01:41:36.943]  And the globalists know that.
[01:41:36.963 --> 01:41:38.864]  If they can blunt that, they can slow us down.
[01:41:39.044 --> 01:41:42.066]  But their outrageous crimes are so legion, they're not getting away with any of this.
[01:41:43.027 --> 01:41:51.073]  For all their arrogance and all their bravado and all their imperial hubris, they are going to fail if you don't lay down in the ditch and lick their boots.
[01:41:53.496 --> 01:42:08.023]  I've seen the films and photos out of Soviet Russia, China, Africa, Nigeria, just where people, they've got hundreds of people lined up on the street, there's only a few guards, they're like, look like there are 15 official government guards.
[01:42:09.523 --> 01:42:13.185]  This is all over the major news channels on YouTube, but we know better.
[01:42:13.405 --> 01:42:17.107]  If I show you a clip of this now and we post it on YouTube, they'll take the site down.
[01:42:17.947 --> 01:42:21.269]  But you, just search the term Nigerian executions.
[01:42:22.225 --> 01:42:23.326]  And you see these people.
[01:42:25.648 --> 01:42:29.451]  It's Christians executing Muslims, and I'm against Muslims killing Christians, and they do it too.
[01:42:29.711 --> 01:42:30.732]  And then Christians kill Muslims.
[01:42:30.772 --> 01:42:31.852]  It's wrong for anybody.
[01:42:32.333 --> 01:42:37.817]  And they're just lining them up, and they take them in the street and have them lay down so they don't have to look them in the eyes, and they shoot them.
[01:42:38.097 --> 01:42:40.639]  And there's people standing there with shops and alleys.
[01:42:40.879 --> 01:42:41.880]  They could run for it.
[01:42:42.261 --> 01:42:45.163]  If all of them ran for it, they'd probably only be able to shoot a third of them.
[01:42:47.508 --> 01:42:49.029]  I would charge the people with guns.
[01:42:49.149 --> 01:42:49.890]  I would fight back.
[01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:55.415]  But in Germany, in Russia, in China, in Nigeria, most people lay down.
[01:42:56.116 --> 01:42:57.397]  I mean, I've seen the film footage.
[01:42:57.457 --> 01:42:58.478]  I know you've seen it as well.
[01:42:58.898 --> 01:43:03.442]  On the Eastern Front with the Nazis stripping down women and children and little kids with pigtails.
[01:43:04.243 --> 01:43:07.946]  You know, it just tears my guts out.
[01:43:07.986 --> 01:43:09.708]  They march them into pits and just shoot them.
[01:43:10.876 --> 01:43:15.717]  And I watch the men sit there while their kids are being led away to be shot, and the men just get down on their knees.
[01:43:15.757 --> 01:43:17.517]  I mean, I would attack!
[01:43:19.338 --> 01:43:25.319]  I would act weak, and then just literally bite the throat out of people.
[01:43:25.639 --> 01:43:29.220]  And by the way, you can do that if you just turn it loose, physically.
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:30.700]  It's the same thing with Infowar.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.201]  If you just get down and dirty.
[01:43:34.926 --> 01:43:37.026]  Folks, you can just break people's arms in a fight.
[01:43:37.046 --> 01:43:41.327]  If you turn off the switch that is a governor, you can just break people.
[01:43:41.867 --> 01:43:43.467]  It's the same thing in the Info War.
[01:43:43.928 --> 01:43:45.668]  I mean, you know what you can do with your bare hands?
[01:43:46.788 --> 01:43:47.088]  Really?
[01:43:47.288 --> 01:43:48.808]  Most people hold back, folks.
[01:43:48.868 --> 01:43:50.769]  It's the same thing in the Societal Info War.
[01:43:50.969 --> 01:43:52.209]  You must command respect.
[01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:53.569]  You must command leadership.
[01:43:53.769 --> 01:43:55.029]  You must know you have the truth.
[01:43:55.209 --> 01:43:56.130]  You must be leaders.
[01:43:56.290 --> 01:43:57.270]  You must be bold.
[01:43:57.310 --> 01:43:58.250]  You must be fearless.
[01:43:58.450 --> 01:44:00.870]  You must never stop in the face of this tyranny.
[01:44:02.191 --> 01:44:03.531]  Or give in to these people.
[01:44:04.824 --> 01:44:07.506]  I will not lay there in a ditch and be machine gunned in the back.
[01:44:08.287 --> 01:44:11.149]  I will not lay there in the ditch if they come try to take my house.
[01:44:11.449 --> 01:44:13.731]  I will not lay there in the ditch if they try to take my children.
[01:44:13.831 --> 01:44:14.452]  I'm done!
[01:44:16.854 --> 01:44:31.466]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'd show it to you, but I guarantee you, PBS and all these nature sites on YouTube, they're allowed to show it, but I guarantee you they'd shut my channel down if I showed you, next it'll probably be if I talk about it, if I showed you
[01:44:34.056 --> 01:44:35.516]  The films of water buffalo.
[01:44:36.217 --> 01:44:58.984]  If I showed you the films of other animals, giraffes, you name it, at watering holes, and a lot of times when a lion comes up and grabs a baby, whether it's a water buffalo or a wildebeest or zebras, I've seen a lot of these films,
[01:45:01.937 --> 01:45:20.723]  The other animals will run up in mass and attack the lions, and then a group of about, in one video, of eight big lions run out to fight them, and the zebras don't care, the giraffes don't care, these are all different videos I've seen, and they all just attack and start kicking and start attacking and even, in one video, kill one of the lions and are just stomping on it wildly.
[01:45:21.283 --> 01:45:23.304]  Animals have this basic instinct.
[01:45:25.465 --> 01:45:26.925]  I mean, where do you see an animal?
[01:45:28.146 --> 01:45:29.006]  Is it maybe a rabbit?
[01:45:31.291 --> 01:45:41.939]  Where do you see an animal that when a prey animal, a prey animal would be a rabbit that gives in, that when a predator comes in and tries to grab them, they don't fight back?
[01:45:45.961 --> 01:45:52.126]  I mean, if you don't fight back, at least with words, folks, the sky's the limit of how bad these people are going to rape us.
[01:45:54.167 --> 01:45:57.570]  And it is not heroic, it is not tough, it is not
[01:45:59.804 --> 01:46:17.870]  Extraordinary for me to sit here and say, if I was in Soviet China, or Communist China, Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, Nigeria, and they were trying to lead people in and shoot them in the back of the head and I was next in line, I would immediately elbow the guy in the nose.
[01:46:18.430 --> 01:46:20.550]  And he'd probably still machine gun me.
[01:46:20.710 --> 01:46:25.152]  But then other people would fight behind me and could get away, or get a gun.
[01:46:26.929 --> 01:46:27.670]  And fight back.
[01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:30.592]  But over and over again I see people who lay down.
[01:46:30.932 --> 01:46:32.273]  What is your problem?
[01:46:32.813 --> 01:46:38.278]  I know right now most Americans would sit there while the government blew their children's heads off and do nothing about it.
[01:46:38.598 --> 01:46:39.739]  What is your problem?
[01:46:40.279 --> 01:46:41.340]  What is wrong with you?
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:42.020]  What did they do to you?
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:43.121]  Well, you've been drinking fluoride.
[01:46:43.321 --> 01:46:44.582]  You've been getting injected with mercury.
[01:46:44.602 --> 01:46:45.443]  You've been eating GMO.
[01:46:45.543 --> 01:46:46.244]  I understand that.
[01:46:46.564 --> 01:46:51.708]  But you've got to fight through the poisoning and get your humanity back and at least stand up and speak out.
[01:46:54.131 --> 01:46:56.553]  Oh my gosh, I got a bunch of economic news here.
[01:46:56.593 --> 01:46:58.094]  It's all just completely insane.
[01:46:58.554 --> 01:46:59.555]  Gold is exploding.
[01:47:01.276 --> 01:47:02.457]  Again, they've been trying to suppress it.
[01:47:02.477 --> 01:47:02.837]  They can't.
[01:47:02.877 --> 01:47:06.780]  The dollar goes up on the news of the Korea situation as the world gets scared.
[01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:07.981]  Now it starts going back down.
[01:47:08.001 --> 01:47:09.902]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up.
[01:47:09.942 --> 01:47:11.984]  Ted, what's the latest economic news you got in front of you?
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:19.924]  Well, right now the IMF is backing off on their sales because the central banks want to start accumulating that back again.
[01:47:20.004 --> 01:47:23.066]  Gotta be clear, they've been selling it quietly to try to drive the price down.
[01:47:23.326 --> 01:47:27.688]  They have been, and now, you know, even they realize their own currencies are faltering.
[01:47:27.708 --> 01:47:32.411]  I mean, for God's sakes, could you imagine being in China right now, watching what's going on in Europe?
[01:47:32.471 --> 01:47:37.493]  I mean, now we've got Portugal, we've got Spain both in trouble.
[01:47:37.934 --> 01:47:41.556]  And so, from the Chinese perspective, they're watching the West just
[01:47:42.236 --> 01:47:46.597]  You know, take the suicide pill and drive their currencies right into the ditch.
[01:47:46.657 --> 01:47:48.678]  I mean, it's like a fast race right now.
[01:47:48.698 --> 01:47:54.799]  The dollar is stronger today, and the only reason why it's stronger today is because the euro is falling faster than the dollar is.
[01:47:55.199 --> 01:47:56.520]  And gold is reflecting it all.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:57.320]  Gold is running up.
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:47:59.460]  It's almost at $1,400 an ounce.
[01:47:59.780 --> 01:48:00.581]  Had a high today of $1,391.
[01:48:02.421 --> 01:48:04.242]  I mean, that's what's going on in gold and silver.
[01:48:04.502 --> 01:48:05.883]  Gold and silver is real money.
[01:48:06.003 --> 01:48:06.904]  It has value.
[01:48:06.964 --> 01:48:08.785]  It doesn't matter what's going on out there.
[01:48:09.185 --> 01:48:16.109]  And when they go on, when Bernanke is turning on the printing process to $600 billion, what do you think is going to happen to gold?
[01:48:16.489 --> 01:48:17.670]  I mean, it's reflecting right now.
[01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:22.092]  Everything is just, you know, Europe is dying.
[01:48:22.132 --> 01:48:23.353]  The United States is going.
[01:48:23.353 --> 01:48:25.875]  We see all these crises being accelerated.
[01:48:25.915 --> 01:48:31.158]  The global banks openly gobbling up Ireland now, admitting foreign banks now dominate them.
[01:48:31.398 --> 01:48:34.340]  They're basically planting their flag and urinating on the Irish people.
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:35.601]  And we're next, Ted.
[01:48:35.621 --> 01:48:37.602]  They're going to move through Europe and then to the United States.
[01:48:37.802 --> 01:48:39.543]  They announced yesterday all the austerity.
[01:48:39.663 --> 01:48:41.945]  They're going to cut the veterans' health care and their pensions.
[01:48:42.185 --> 01:48:43.606]  They're going to cut the federal workers.
[01:48:43.626 --> 01:48:44.767]  People are like, well, aren't you for that?
[01:48:45.427 --> 01:48:52.551]  No, first you get the big bankers that have created the mess and stolen trillions and you write off all that debt that they've created artificially.
[01:48:53.031 --> 01:48:55.012]  That's where the, that's the black hole.
[01:48:55.032 --> 01:48:58.974]  I hear all these fake conservatives praising all these big cuts.
[01:48:59.514 --> 01:49:02.495]  You watch, you mark my words, this isn't going to fix anything.
[01:49:02.715 --> 01:49:04.116]  It's not designed to fix anything.
[01:49:04.496 --> 01:49:06.517]  Now everything's got to go to the bankers.
[01:49:06.557 --> 01:49:07.678]  That's why this is happening.
[01:49:08.158 --> 01:49:09.639]  It is going that direction, Alex.
[01:49:09.659 --> 01:49:15.202]  You just simply, the United States government can't fix this problem by cutting back on expenses.
[01:49:15.362 --> 01:49:19.765]  It has to actually get away from this debt-based fiat system that we're in.
[01:49:20.165 --> 01:49:22.267]  Because we have a compounding problem.
[01:49:22.587 --> 01:49:24.568]  The interest has been adding to it since 1913.
[01:49:24.768 --> 01:49:29.171]  It's becoming bigger and more ferocious as time goes on.
[01:49:29.531 --> 01:49:33.153]  The appetite is growing, it's not shrinking, and it's going to consume us.
[01:49:33.233 --> 01:49:34.114]  And that's just the way it is.
[01:49:34.714 --> 01:49:40.001]  You have to get away from a fiat system if you don't want to have compounding interest working against you.
[01:49:40.322 --> 01:49:41.803]  Right now, I mean, it's simple as this.
[01:49:42.044 --> 01:49:43.426]  The Fed right now is buying U.S.
[01:49:43.466 --> 01:49:49.393]  government treasuries to try to stimulate the economy, which is putting the United States taxpayers deeper and deeper in debt.
[01:49:50.034 --> 01:49:52.417]  I mean, why can't people see this?
[01:49:52.817 --> 01:49:57.002]  Of course they're trying to drive the interest rates down and they're trying to get this money to the people at the bottom.
[01:49:57.503 --> 01:50:03.269]  And it's not happening because the central banks are giving the money to their member banks and the member banks are buying U.S.
[01:50:03.309 --> 01:50:04.510]  government treasuries with this.
[01:50:05.031 --> 01:50:10.153]  Absolutely, they're hoarding it for themselves while shutting down Main Street and they're getting record bonuses.
[01:50:10.173 --> 01:50:11.893]  I mean, they're absolute criminals.
[01:50:12.253 --> 01:50:18.635]  There's a bunch of special gold and silver offers only available to radio listeners on silver half dollars, full silver dollars.
[01:50:18.955 --> 01:50:21.876]  They've got silver dollar deals where you can get my films free.
[01:50:22.536 --> 01:50:26.858]  They've got great deals on francs, on sovereigns, on all sorts of gold coins.
[01:50:26.878 --> 01:50:26.918]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:31.059 --> 01:50:32.439]  Is the toll-free number to call?
[01:50:32.819 --> 01:50:38.061]  I would say purchase the gold and silver to support the network and the show, but at these prices, I see the margins.
[01:50:38.101 --> 01:50:39.121]  There's almost no profit.
[01:50:39.401 --> 01:50:44.742]  Plus, Ted buys when it's low, sells low when it's high, so it's incredible.
[01:50:44.762 --> 01:50:45.123]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:45.263 --> 01:50:52.164]  I want to give folks a brief menu on the other side, Ted, of some of the special offers you've got.
[01:50:52.184 --> 01:50:56.585]  Then we'll let you go, and I'll get into all the legislation they're passing right now during the lame duck.
[01:50:56.986 --> 01:50:57.866]  More on the economy.
[01:50:57.886 --> 01:50:58.386]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.018 --> 01:51:02.279]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.319 --> 01:51:07.661]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.902 --> 01:51:12.544]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.924 --> 01:51:13.324]  It's true.
[01:51:13.404 --> 01:51:17.967]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.487 --> 01:51:23.190]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.711 --> 01:51:25.652]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:26.032 --> 01:51:30.635]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.835 --> 01:51:31.736]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.956 --> 01:51:34.718]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:35.018 --> 01:51:38.340]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.641 --> 01:51:41.482]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:41.843 --> 01:51:43.724]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:44.064 --> 01:51:44.985]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:48.607 --> 01:51:49.288]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:50.049 --> 01:51:57.357]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.678 --> 01:52:00.061]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.970 --> 01:52:05.575]  Hurricanes, ice storms, blackouts, and the prospect of civil unrest.
[01:52:05.795 --> 01:52:08.577]  When the unexpected happens, will you be ready?
[01:52:08.838 --> 01:52:16.045]  Hundreds of concerned citizens across America have already installed wind generators to help protect their families in the event of a disaster.
[01:52:16.265 --> 01:52:22.371]  So act now and build your own wind generator with an easy to assemble kit from windbluepower.com.
[01:52:22.711 --> 01:52:28.575]  Wind Blue Power carries the best battery-charging wind generators and permanent magnet alternators in the country.

[01:53:04.635 --> 01:53:06.596]  And who better to help you give the gift this holiday season?
[01:53:12.932 --> 01:53:13.892]  We're good to go!
[01:53:42.421 --> 01:53:42.861]  We're good to go.
[01:54:14.938 --> 01:54:16.740]  Going back to Ted Anderson.
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:26.711]  Next hour I'm going to cover what's happening in Congress, all the horrid legislation that they're passing and trying to pass, including internet total censorship and takeover.
[01:54:27.833 --> 01:54:30.234]  I've got some key videos and audio I want to play.
[01:54:30.254 --> 01:54:46.117]  I want to get into the day after Thanksgiving, Black Friday hysteria, and this beautiful piece of work that's been done on YouTube that really illustrates everything we're facing in four beautifully put minutes.
[01:54:46.817 --> 01:54:48.878]  So that's coming up, a jam-packed third hour.
[01:54:49.858 --> 01:54:56.122]  But going back to Ted Anderson, Ted, I mean, everybody says they're giving people good deals on gold and silver.
[01:54:57.543 --> 01:55:00.204]  And I've seen people that do kind of the bait-and-switches.
[01:55:02.486 --> 01:55:06.888]  You know, every once in a while I can find something lower, but whenever I contact them, they're out of it.
[01:55:07.288 --> 01:55:14.913]  When you say you've got this gold and silver at these prices, when most people have run out, or most people don't have it, or they've got huge premiums,
[01:55:17.196 --> 01:55:20.799]  I mean, when you say that you've got this stuff on hand, you do, and those are the deals.
[01:55:21.539 --> 01:55:22.540]  Yeah, it sure is.
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:26.423]  When I quote a price, Alex, we made a commitment to that price.
[01:55:26.483 --> 01:55:29.325]  If somebody comes in and buys something, it's going to be that price.
[01:55:29.645 --> 01:55:45.836]  Whether if gold sits at this $13.90 level or jumps up to $14.25, they're going to get what they ordered, at the price they ordered it, and it's going to come in a timely fashion, and they're going to find that it's secure, that it's insured, that it's... everything is done professionally here at Midas.
[01:55:45.876 --> 01:55:46.397]  There is just
[01:55:47.037 --> 01:55:54.764]  You know, we take such great care to make sure that... Absolutely, and anybody that does a big volume of business over the years will make people angry.
[01:55:55.525 --> 01:56:02.171]  But there are very few gold outfits, in fact I haven't seen another, that has a AAA Better Business Bureau rating like you do.
[01:56:02.612 --> 01:56:05.915]  I know there's some other reputable groups that my family over the years has used.
[01:56:06.376 --> 01:56:12.226]  And my family's very happy and they've got bad ratings because you get hundreds of thousands of customers over the years.
[01:56:12.507 --> 01:56:13.589]  Some of them are going to get mad.
[01:56:13.649 --> 01:56:14.490]  Some are going to be weird.
[01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:16.975]  Some of them are going to be unstable and they're going to go complain.
[01:56:19.504 --> 01:56:25.268]  I feel very good promoting the deals you have.
[01:56:25.568 --> 01:56:30.031]  Briefly Ted, tell folks some of the best deals you've got that are just for radio listeners right now.
[01:56:49.144 --> 01:56:52.147]  That's an incredible buy.
[01:56:52.167 --> 01:56:55.150]  Basically, you pay for the silver dollars and get a very good deal.
[01:56:55.371 --> 01:56:59.575]  Then you get free shipping and three of my hottest, most powerful films for free.
[01:56:59.955 --> 01:57:01.337]  Even if you've seen them, great!
[01:57:01.817 --> 01:57:08.545]  Now you've got three of my most hard-hitting films to give to people this Christmas, this holiday season, and
[01:57:09.125 --> 01:57:15.970]  I'm selling to Ted for almost nothing so he can add them, because my goal is just to get the info out, but then we end up getting a little bit of support as well.
[01:57:16.251 --> 01:57:18.492]  We're not funded by George Soros or The Globalist.
[01:57:18.793 --> 01:57:22.476]  We're funded by our sponsors and you that buy the books and videos.
[01:57:22.676 --> 01:57:25.438]  So here's a win-win-win-win-win for everybody.
[01:57:25.818 --> 01:57:33.924]  I can tell you Ted loses money on this, but he wants you to get that silver in your hand so you experience just how great it is to physically hold it
[01:57:34.758 --> 01:57:38.962]  There's also the big movement to expose Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and others.
[01:57:39.242 --> 01:57:41.924]  And there's silver manipulation to physically hold it.
[01:57:42.184 --> 01:57:43.445]  That's really gaining steam.
[01:57:43.646 --> 01:57:45.027]  This is very exciting.
[01:57:45.567 --> 01:57:46.928]  Briefly, Teb, we're almost out of time.
[01:57:47.169 --> 01:57:48.229]  What are some of the other offers?
[01:57:48.410 --> 01:57:49.971]  Yeah, the Franks currently right now are
[01:57:50.952 --> 01:57:54.154]  $2.94.
[01:57:50.992 --> 01:57:54.154]  I know they're going up because gold just went up about $20 an ounce.
[01:57:54.194 --> 01:57:55.496]  British Sovereign's $3.69.
[01:57:55.736 --> 01:57:56.556]  The same is true.
[01:57:57.097 --> 01:57:58.178]  Walking Liberty halves $12.84.
[01:57:58.698 --> 01:58:02.541]  You know, we talked a lot about those Lakota Nation coins.
[01:58:02.581 --> 01:58:07.486]  So this is where a one-ounce silver coin is trading right now in new proof condition.
[01:58:07.506 --> 01:58:07.486]  $34.
[01:58:07.606 --> 01:58:12.129]  That's a comparison to where you're at with that $12.84 with that Walking Liberty.
[01:58:12.490 --> 01:58:13.391]  It's such a great buy.
[01:58:14.231 --> 01:58:14.812]  Absolutely.
[01:58:14.852 --> 01:58:16.173]  Let me give them the number.
[01:58:16.193 --> 01:58:17.334]  800-686-2237.
[01:58:17.354 --> 01:58:17.694]  800-686-2237.
[01:58:17.734 --> 01:58:30.344]  The best deals you're going to find are live here on the radio, but they're a little bit more on the internet because of some of the, you know, handling issues.
[01:58:30.604 --> 01:58:32.565]  You can also find it at MinusResources.com.
[01:58:32.585 --> 01:58:32.625]  800-686-2237.
[01:58:32.645 --> 01:58:38.670]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get the best deals out there you can find anywhere.
[01:58:38.690 --> 01:58:39.631]  Thank you, Ted Anderson.
[01:58:43.311 --> 01:58:45.176]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.739 --> 01:58:48.924]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.868 --> 01:58:54.831]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:58:55.071 --> 01:59:01.095]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:59:01.475 --> 01:59:08.500]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:13.383]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:59:13.663 --> 01:59:17.406]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com
[01:59:21.148 --> 01:59:26.111]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:59:26.572 --> 01:59:29.313]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:59:29.354 --> 01:59:35.117]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:59:35.157 --> 01:59:35.417]  Thank you.
[01:59:53.655 --> 01:59:55.580]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.041 --> 01:59:58.808]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.495 --> 02:00:06.116]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.796 --> 02:00:07.837]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.558 --> 02:00:09.699]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.319 --> 02:00:11.140]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:12.821]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.462 --> 02:00:17.085]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.645 --> 02:00:21.769]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.051 --> 02:00:28.815]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got breaking news on the Google Trends issue.
[02:00:30.036 --> 02:00:33.338]  It's gotta be over 50 times you've made search terms that we put out number one.
[02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:38.172]  PrisonPlanet.com was delisted from Google News Feeds.
[02:00:38.272 --> 02:00:39.193]  We've been there eight years.
[02:00:40.113 --> 02:00:42.735]  They're trying to shut down our YouTube channel for no reason.
[02:00:42.775 --> 02:00:43.756]  We've covered that earlier.
[02:00:43.776 --> 02:00:50.401]  And I went to check Google Trends and I noticed that it said Google Trends down.
[02:00:50.461 --> 02:00:52.422]  Top Google Trends are a day behind.
[02:00:53.123 --> 02:00:57.786]  That's out of the Huffington Post, the Examiner, Innovative.
[02:00:59.938 --> 02:01:06.941]  It's November 29th, 2010, and so I guess they've just shut it down because we're using it and other people are using it.
[02:01:08.682 --> 02:01:14.124]  I'm not sure what's going on, but this is... This is bizarre.
[02:01:18.346 --> 02:01:21.187]  Uh, wow, uh, this is crazy.
[02:01:22.276 --> 02:01:28.102]  So I guess we won't have the number one terms today unless it's all backing up and there's some problem and then it comes out we're number one.
[02:01:28.362 --> 02:01:37.372]  Don't worry Google, we'll hit you with Google is evil and Prison Planet, Black Lucid by Google, we'll hit you with all that as soon as your trends come back up.
[02:01:37.632 --> 02:01:42.377]  I know they're in there trying to figure out how to stop us and I mean that's probably what this is.
[02:01:42.417 --> 02:01:44.299]  I mean you notice we launched the whole TSA thing.
[02:01:45.433 --> 02:01:56.095]  A prophet is not known in his own country, I guess the Bible says, and some people who've been listening to us for years don't realize that this show, the websites, the films, it's not even about Alex Jones.
[02:01:56.135 --> 02:02:05.097]  It's this community that's formed around what I've done, and with others working together, and the system is scared of what we're doing.
[02:02:06.018 --> 02:02:07.958]  The system is scared big time.
[02:02:08.658 --> 02:02:10.099]  And hey, what's the saying?
[02:02:14.178 --> 02:02:20.000]  Winners never quit and losers and quitters never win.
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:20.920]  How's the saying going?
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:22.400]  I sound like George Bush doing a quote now.
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:23.061]  George W. Bush.
[02:02:23.601 --> 02:02:30.083]  No, it's quitters never win and winners never quit.
[02:02:30.743 --> 02:02:31.163]  That's right.
[02:02:31.892 --> 02:02:32.573]  That's how you say it.
[02:02:33.314 --> 02:02:35.436]  Quitters never win, and winners never quit.
[02:02:35.836 --> 02:02:37.318]  And so, we're not stopping.
[02:02:37.658 --> 02:02:38.639]  We're not going away.
[02:02:38.959 --> 02:02:39.760]  We're never quitting.
[02:02:40.201 --> 02:02:43.324]  The globalists spend all their time trying to teach you how you're powerless.
[02:02:44.045 --> 02:02:47.068]  They spend all their time trying to teach you that you don't have any power.
[02:02:47.088 --> 02:02:48.009]  Well, I got news from you.
[02:02:49.110 --> 02:02:49.811]  I got news for you.
[02:02:53.015 --> 02:03:08.830]  They're not going to stop us, and they cannot stop you, the listeners, going and getting the article at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, Google BlacklistPrisonPlanet.com, and sending that to your email list, your Facebook, your Twitter, your MySpace, to everybody you know.
[02:03:08.850 --> 02:03:12.033]  Just sending it to local radio stations, local TV stations.
[02:03:12.333 --> 02:03:16.617]  If we don't all hang together, we will surely hang separate.
[02:03:18.314 --> 02:03:37.341]  And Watson's really written a detailed report on all of this, but it's important, I think, for him to add to his report that this is a big deal, and this is all part of the constellation of Internet censorship and clampdown and crackdown that's happening right now.
[02:03:39.502 --> 02:03:42.803]  But again, please, get these articles out to everyone.
[02:03:42.883 --> 02:03:46.765]  If they can wear us out, if they can train us to accept this, it's going to be everybody.
[02:03:48.018 --> 02:03:49.820]  And this is where they're openly moving.
[02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:51.801]  Google is evil.
[02:03:52.262 --> 02:03:54.083]  Stop being evil, Google.
[02:03:54.584 --> 02:04:00.749]  We know the CIA admittedly gave you your first money and set you up, and you're basically NSA keyword software.
[02:04:01.289 --> 02:04:02.811]  We know that's the kernel of your system.
[02:04:03.051 --> 02:04:05.493]  We know you're buying up all the other big technology companies.
[02:04:05.933 --> 02:04:09.997]  You're definitely moving into a monopoly zone, an oligopoly zone, bare minimum.
[02:04:10.297 --> 02:04:11.578]  You are a cartel leader.
[02:04:12.219 --> 02:04:14.361]  You are destroying the free market system.
[02:04:15.419 --> 02:04:17.080]  And you're now attacking the First Amendment.
[02:04:17.500 --> 02:04:19.801]  And I want everyone to declare war on Google.
[02:04:20.361 --> 02:04:22.442]  Unless they come out and sign an armistice.
[02:04:22.922 --> 02:04:24.923]  And again, believe you have power.
[02:04:25.544 --> 02:04:27.024]  We're not going to stop with the TSA.
[02:04:27.244 --> 02:04:29.946]  A year ago I had a contest about the naked body scanners.
[02:04:31.046 --> 02:04:32.227]  We've been covering it since then.
[02:04:32.707 --> 02:04:34.348]  And then it blew up in the last month.
[02:04:35.028 --> 02:04:36.328]  And now it's simmered down a bit.
[02:04:36.368 --> 02:04:37.149]  It's still a huge story.
[02:04:37.169 --> 02:04:38.189]  It's going to blow up again.
[02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:41.331]  There's many battles on the road to liberty.
[02:04:41.751 --> 02:04:43.252]  But you have to decide what road you're on.
[02:04:43.292 --> 02:04:43.912]  The road to liberty?
[02:04:45.632 --> 02:04:46.454]  Or the road to tyranny.
[02:04:46.694 --> 02:04:47.796]  By the way, there's AP.
[02:04:48.277 --> 02:04:49.059]  This just came out.
[02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:51.984]  EU launches antitrust probe into Google searches.
[02:04:53.006 --> 02:04:54.489]  I was saying we should have that earlier.
[02:04:54.809 --> 02:04:55.310]  Oh yeah!
[02:04:55.631 --> 02:04:56.112]  Oh yeah!
[02:04:56.152 --> 02:04:56.993]  We're coming after you!
[02:04:57.013 --> 02:04:57.635]  Get that straight!
[02:05:04.904 --> 02:05:05.825]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:06.165 --> 02:05:09.688]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:10.088 --> 02:05:12.310]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.330 --> 02:05:17.774]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:18.194 --> 02:05:24.479]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:24.879 --> 02:05:30.424]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:30.824 --> 02:05:34.527]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:05:35.007 --> 02:05:38.990]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:39.290 --> 02:05:44.814]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.234 --> 02:05:48.196]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.797 --> 02:05:50.218]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:50.778 --> 02:05:51.278]  It's here.

[02:07:01.596 --> 02:07:05.240]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:05.620 --> 02:07:08.623]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:08.863 --> 02:07:13.627]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:07:13.647 --> 02:07:19.913]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:20.053 --> 02:07:22.296]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:22.816 --> 02:07:23.096]  Tim Geithner?
[02:07:23.116 --> 02:07:23.536]  Bernanke?
[02:07:23.636 --> 02:07:24.397]  They're arsonists!
[02:07:24.437 --> 02:07:25.577]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:25.597 --> 02:07:27.838]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:41.724 --> 02:07:43.565]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:07:43.585 --> 02:07:48.666]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.

[02:08:01.749 --> 02:08:07.331]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:15.011 --> 02:08:18.192]  Teacher bans pencils from class.
[02:08:19.453 --> 02:08:21.633]  Cited as potential weapon making.
[02:08:22.734 --> 02:08:25.315]  That's what the AP Reuters are reporting on.
[02:08:25.335 --> 02:08:29.856]  Matt Ryan wrote a story about it at InfoWars.com.
[02:08:29.936 --> 02:08:32.257]  Teacher bans pencils from class.
[02:08:33.017 --> 02:08:35.078]  Cited as potential weapon making.
[02:08:36.638 --> 02:08:40.300]  Remember in 1984, you're not allowed to have a pencil or a journal.
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:43.802]  And of course, next, will they ban pens because they're pointed?
[02:08:44.502 --> 02:08:48.404]  Next, will they cut our fists off because they could be used as weapons?
[02:08:49.424 --> 02:08:55.767]  Next, will they... I mean, I've actually seen people arrested for bringing a plastic knife to put their butter.
[02:08:56.788 --> 02:08:57.868]  I see that every few months.
[02:08:58.569 --> 02:09:00.149]  There was one case with a valedictorian.
[02:09:00.169 --> 02:09:01.190]  It was the last day of school.
[02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:05.052]  She brought a pie for her teacher for an after-school party.
[02:09:06.377 --> 02:09:07.624]  With some of the kids in the class?
[02:09:09.153 --> 02:09:09.837]  I even did that.
[02:09:10.851 --> 02:09:13.232]  I remember my last day of high school here in Austin.
[02:09:13.272 --> 02:09:15.352]  I was in school in Dallas and moved down here.
[02:09:15.972 --> 02:09:23.894]  Being invited by one of the coaches who taught history class was some of his favorite students and I've never really been a teacher's pet but he was nice.
[02:09:23.914 --> 02:09:24.834]  We like talking about history.
[02:09:25.195 --> 02:09:34.817]  He invited us up there and he had some donuts and some soft drinks and we just talked about 20 minutes and he said good luck in college and everything and that was the end of it.
[02:09:35.317 --> 02:09:38.558]  Well, I guess if he brings a plastic
[02:09:39.238 --> 02:09:41.559]  You know, Dixie Knife to spread butter on a bagel!
[02:09:42.039 --> 02:09:43.179]  You get arrested!
[02:09:43.579 --> 02:09:49.040]  And in the case of that valedictorian, they took her degree, made her go back another year of school.
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:51.281]  That was in the news a few years ago.
[02:09:51.961 --> 02:09:59.402]  And I've seen cases of seniors, they want to get you before you get out of there, where in one case, it's always a high-graded student.
[02:09:59.822 --> 02:10:01.443]  In the other case, it was a salutatorian.
[02:10:01.463 --> 02:10:02.423]  It was a girl again.
[02:10:02.863 --> 02:10:07.384]  Her mother had bought her, because she was moving out that weekend to go to college early.
[02:10:08.649 --> 02:10:09.490]  And it was in her truck.
[02:10:09.530 --> 02:10:10.091]  They saw it.
[02:10:11.613 --> 02:10:18.221]  A plastic box with the metal, you know, spoons, steak knives in the package.
[02:10:18.982 --> 02:10:19.723]  They arrested her.
[02:10:21.465 --> 02:10:23.688]  And they said, sorry, zero tolerance.
[02:10:26.391 --> 02:10:26.992]  You've got a
[02:10:29.887 --> 02:10:30.407]  Steak knife.
[02:10:30.427 --> 02:10:35.250]  And they're like, but it's a package of spoons and forks and butter knives and a few steak knives.
[02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:36.390]  You know, we bought it at Walmart.
[02:10:36.671 --> 02:10:37.391]  They said, we don't care.
[02:10:37.471 --> 02:10:42.794]  You're going to jail because a security guard walking through, oh, I found something.
[02:10:42.834 --> 02:10:46.516]  Not, oh, that's a box, a sealed box of knives, forks and spoons.
[02:10:47.576 --> 02:10:54.160]  It's the same obsession with government and minions of government doing exactly what they're told and throwing the book at citizens.
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:58.062]  But then when bankers steal trillions and tell Congress they won't say where it is, nothing happens.
[02:11:01.215 --> 02:11:10.460]  Or, oh, we don't want people protesting the body scanners, we don't want to give them a fight, we want to retreat, we'll just do no body scanning or no pat-downs the day before Thanksgiving.
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:12.141]  And now that's confirmed.
[02:11:13.001 --> 02:11:22.025]  On Wednesday we were saying we're getting these reports, and then by Thanksgiving Day it was all over mainstream news that they had suspended the pat-downs and the body scans.
[02:11:22.666 --> 02:11:26.648]  If terrorists are just everywhere, why suspend it nationwide?
[02:11:27.805 --> 02:11:35.629]  It's an act of submission, an act of domination, setting the precedent for minimum-wage federal goons to stick their hands down your pants.
[02:11:35.889 --> 02:11:38.330]  It's always more, more, more, more, more.
[02:11:40.131 --> 02:11:48.814]  And I've seen news articles mainstream going, well, some joke that it may be a cavity search next, but terrorists are talking about putting a bomb up their rear end.
[02:11:49.375 --> 02:11:53.617]  We better pull people out and stick our hands up their behinds.
[02:11:54.932 --> 02:11:58.314]  And I'm sorry to have to talk about this, but this is what they're getting ready to do!
[02:11:58.694 --> 02:12:09.722]  I don't want to talk for a month about them sticking their hands down our pants, but if we don't do it, if we don't talk about it and say no, it's gonna be more, more, more, more, more, more, more.
[02:12:10.462 --> 02:12:15.666]  And in Matt Ryan's article, he points out the countless cases of kids will bring a G.I.
[02:12:15.686 --> 02:12:23.291]  Joe figure with a two-centimeter pistol, kicked out of school, arrested in some of the cases.
[02:12:24.352 --> 02:12:27.677]  I mean, you've all seen them in the news, or in art class.
[02:12:28.017 --> 02:12:31.502]  They continue all over the country to suspend or arrest or expel.
[02:12:31.803 --> 02:12:32.524]  It runs the gamut.
[02:12:33.405 --> 02:12:37.170]  They'll say, draw a image of your parents.
[02:12:38.203 --> 02:12:39.284]  You know, draw a portrait of him.
[02:12:39.564 --> 02:12:49.854]  And so, a kid, this is even in like third, fourth, fifth grade I've seen these cases, will draw a photo, a picture, of their dad, a policeman with a gun.
[02:12:50.414 --> 02:12:50.735]  Boom!
[02:12:51.475 --> 02:12:56.840]  When they're in elementary, they get suspended and get in trouble and they demand psychological evaluation.
[02:12:57.601 --> 02:13:01.585]  They've had art students who were 16, 17 years old who get arrested.
[02:13:02.617 --> 02:13:07.418]  One case, the kid drew a painting of his dad who's in the Marines with an M16.
[02:13:07.498 --> 02:13:14.920]  Folks, they're training you that the image of a gun is a crime when citizens have it or when slaves have it.
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:19.841]  But when a SWAT team has it, when they're at a checkpoint, we're taught it's to keep us safe.
[02:13:20.361 --> 02:13:23.882]  Oh, the government in black uniforms with guns, that's good.
[02:13:24.642 --> 02:13:27.243]  Oh, citizens with guns, that's bad.
[02:13:29.343 --> 02:13:31.164]  Oh, you brought a plastic knife.
[02:13:32.574 --> 02:13:36.938]  In fact, in one of the cases, the one with the valedictorian, that was probably six, seven years ago, I saw that report.
[02:13:38.359 --> 02:13:43.263]  It made national attention, you probably remember it, you can pull it up.
[02:13:45.325 --> 02:13:56.254]  The security guard was just going class to class, because the school day was over, and the security guard walked in where they had the pie or the cake or whatever it was, and literally just went completely ape.
[02:13:56.394 --> 02:13:58.716]  Oh my God, there is a plastic butter knife.
[02:14:01.744 --> 02:14:03.785]  So, are we going to ban fist next?
[02:14:04.066 --> 02:14:05.767]  Are we going to ban glass bottles?
[02:14:05.787 --> 02:14:07.988]  You could break those and use it as a knife.
[02:14:09.209 --> 02:14:12.611]  Are we going to ban owning gasoline at your house for your lawnmower?
[02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:14.732]  Because you might use it as a mall-off cocktail.
[02:14:15.193 --> 02:14:16.073]  Where does it end?
[02:14:16.554 --> 02:14:17.274]  It doesn't end.
[02:14:17.634 --> 02:14:18.615]  That's the plan.
[02:14:18.935 --> 02:14:19.976]  That's the program.
[02:14:20.236 --> 02:14:21.457]  That's the operation.
[02:14:22.197 --> 02:14:22.998]  All over the country.
[02:14:24.082 --> 02:14:29.064]  I've seen reports of children being arrested for playing with toy guns.
[02:14:29.624 --> 02:14:33.586]  And you read the reports, it says the green gun, the orange gun, the bright yellow gun.
[02:14:34.026 --> 02:14:36.287]  You know, the 10-year-old was playing in his front yard.
[02:14:36.587 --> 02:14:41.109]  A police officer saw him aiming it at his friend as they were having a Nerf battle.
[02:14:41.189 --> 02:14:41.989]  He was arrested.
[02:14:42.170 --> 02:14:43.350]  People won't believe it if they didn't hear it.
[02:14:43.630 --> 02:14:45.291]  Guys, search, child arrested.
[02:14:46.681 --> 02:14:47.401]  For a toy gun?
[02:14:47.421 --> 02:14:49.063]  I mean, you'll just see the cases everywhere.
[02:14:49.763 --> 02:14:53.125]  Ladies and gentlemen, will I be arrested for having this toy gun?
[02:14:53.145 --> 02:14:55.447]  If you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv?
[02:14:58.209 --> 02:15:00.550]  It shoots little rubber discs?
[02:15:00.951 --> 02:15:01.851]  Am I Al Qaeda?
[02:15:02.251 --> 02:15:04.293]  I mean, if I drew an image of this?
[02:15:04.673 --> 02:15:07.755]  Understand that, again, a decade ago they banned dodgeball.
[02:15:07.815 --> 02:15:11.278]  Then they banned, five, six years ago, in almost every school district, running.
[02:15:11.758 --> 02:15:13.219]  Then they banned touching.
[02:15:16.178 --> 02:15:18.860]  No arm wrestling, no pats on the back, no hugs.
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:21.582]  It's a ninnying prison society.
[02:15:22.142 --> 02:15:24.124]  So, I'm gonna commit a crime right now on air.
[02:15:24.364 --> 02:15:27.346]  It's not a crime, but in public schools and now private schools it is.
[02:15:27.546 --> 02:15:30.949]  Give me a document cam shot, please, for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[02:15:31.649 --> 02:15:32.990]  I'm gonna commit a crime right now.
[02:15:34.331 --> 02:15:35.012]  A thought crime.
[02:15:35.472 --> 02:15:40.175]  I'm going to draw the image of a G.I.
[02:15:40.236 --> 02:15:40.596]  Joe
[02:15:44.853 --> 02:15:45.455]  A G.I.
[02:15:45.495 --> 02:15:53.734]  Joe figure with a gun.
[02:15:57.785 --> 02:16:09.194]  You draw something like that in a public school, if you are in 1st through 5th, you're gonna get a psychological evaluation, CPS visits, police may even be called.
[02:16:09.974 --> 02:16:14.438]  If you are in 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, or 12th grade, you will go to jail for this.
[02:16:15.765 --> 02:16:21.846]  By the way, you've seen the countless reports about English students in public school writing a story.
[02:16:21.886 --> 02:16:26.767]  It's almost always about zombies, because there's literally hundreds of movies and TV shows about zombies and vampires.
[02:16:26.827 --> 02:16:27.568]  It's very popular.
[02:16:27.588 --> 02:16:37.770]  And I saw several cases in just the last few years of people being arrested for writing fiction stories about zombies attacking a fictitious high school.
[02:16:39.130 --> 02:16:40.010]  And I've told the story.
[02:16:40.710 --> 02:16:43.411]  I remember in sixth grade,
[02:16:46.394 --> 02:17:00.701]  Being in English class and writing a story about zombies and how me and my buddy were in a pickup truck, we didn't have cars yet but we were imagining it, driving in front of the school shooting zombies.
[02:17:01.662 --> 02:17:03.863]  I was given an A plus for it.
[02:17:04.443 --> 02:17:07.585]  I remember, because in sixth grade folks I was not a good student.
[02:17:07.945 --> 02:17:08.785]  An A plus was rare.
[02:17:10.506 --> 02:17:12.427]  I mean I was in high school five years to give you an idea.
[02:17:12.447 --> 02:17:15.929]  I was too busy chasing cheerleaders in my first year in high school.
[02:17:17.341 --> 02:17:17.841]  And flunked.
[02:17:19.121 --> 02:17:24.102]  But the issue is, I got an A-plus for this in the mid-1980s.
[02:17:24.122 --> 02:17:26.243]  Give me a document, Kim.
[02:17:26.623 --> 02:17:30.724]  A-plus in 1980.
[02:17:33.244 --> 02:17:39.026]  You get jail in 2010.
[02:17:39.946 --> 02:17:41.606]  That is thought crime.
[02:17:44.167 --> 02:17:45.647]  And that's where all of this is going.
[02:17:47.341 --> 02:17:49.703]  And I see reports all the time in the U.S.
[02:17:49.763 --> 02:17:51.745]  of people being arrested for racial slayings.
[02:17:53.807 --> 02:17:55.609]  There is no law against it.
[02:17:55.849 --> 02:17:58.472]  I don't like it, but if you take somebody's right, it's over.
[02:17:58.772 --> 02:17:59.733]  Yeah, put it back up on screen.
[02:17:59.753 --> 02:18:00.394]  They found an article.
[02:18:00.414 --> 02:18:04.097]  10-year-old with toy gun arrested, fingerprinted.
[02:18:04.538 --> 02:18:05.238]  That's in Georgia.
[02:18:05.779 --> 02:18:10.704]  The latest case of zero tolerance at public schools as a 10-year-old student.
[02:18:14.159 --> 02:18:15.280]  Sadder and wiser.
[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:16.440]  Oh, see, it's good.
[02:18:17.001 --> 02:18:19.722]  And facing expulsion and long-term juvenile detention.
[02:18:20.382 --> 02:18:25.105]  And it has his mother worried that his punishment has already been harsher than the offense demands.
[02:18:25.365 --> 02:18:27.726]  See, the mother's so cowed that she's saying, oh, this is too harsh.
[02:18:28.167 --> 02:18:29.067]  It's ridiculous!
[02:18:36.351 --> 02:18:43.395]  He brought a toy cowboy plastic six-shooter to the school with a red tip.
[02:18:47.608 --> 02:18:50.111]  They bought it at the toy store along with a cowboy hat.
[02:18:51.013 --> 02:19:04.751]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, my father, just 43 years ago or so, took his shotgun and rifles to school with him.
[02:19:06.584 --> 02:19:07.884]  But they all knew gun safety.
[02:19:08.645 --> 02:19:10.545]  The principals all had guns in their offices.
[02:19:10.565 --> 02:19:11.646]  You didn't have school shootings.
[02:19:12.006 --> 02:19:22.610]  Let me tell you, in the 1950s, the early 1960s, didn't matter if it was New York City or East Texas, if some nut took a gun in a school, they're going to be dead in minutes.
[02:19:24.997 --> 02:19:31.559]  Nowadays, they teach the children in school drills to get on their knees and wait to die.
[02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:37.762]  They don't teach them, get out the window, run, have a teacher that's armed, fight back, wait.
[02:19:38.862 --> 02:19:48.986]  I mean, if somebody was shooting and I didn't have a gun, I couldn't get out the window, they had burglar bars, I would crouch down behind the door, and when the guy opened the door, he wouldn't be expecting it, and I would break his jaw.
[02:19:50.489 --> 02:19:51.951]  A lot of you feel like you're weak.
[02:19:52.031 --> 02:19:56.198]  Folks, if somebody's coming to kill you, you just tell your brain, go into attack mode.
[02:19:56.579 --> 02:20:00.705]  The littlest scrawniest of you can literally beat the daylights out of an NFL lineman.
[02:20:01.681 --> 02:20:03.762]  Attention shoppers, please stay in line.
[02:20:03.902 --> 02:20:06.684]  You must be scanned and searched before entering the mall area.
[02:20:06.844 --> 02:20:11.326]  Attention, you must disrobe and pass through the scanner at mall security before entering the building.
[02:20:11.746 --> 02:20:16.889]  Hey, most GCN listeners know that the future of Christmas shopping may quite well be that scary.
[02:20:17.089 --> 02:20:22.732]  And while we're not there yet, as shoppers we still face terrible traffic, crazy lines, and even crazier shoppers.
[02:20:22.912 --> 02:20:24.373]  But this year can be different.
[02:20:24.693 --> 02:20:30.736]  You can still opt out of the craziness and do your shopping off the grid by going to offthegridchristmas.com.

[02:21:30.154 --> 02:21:39.440]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:40.221]  This capitalism?
[02:21:40.281 --> 02:21:46.425]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:21:46.545 --> 02:21:47.366]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:21:47.426 --> 02:21:50.528]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[02:21:50.688 --> 02:21:51.448]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:21:51.468 --> 02:21:52.829]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:21:52.889 --> 02:21:53.169]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.209 --> 02:21:53.490]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.454 --> 02:22:05.319]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:22:05.439 --> 02:22:06.199]  What have we got?
[02:22:06.420 --> 02:22:08.561]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:22:08.862 --> 02:22:09.622]  A republic.
[02:22:09.883 --> 02:22:12.465]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:22:12.525 --> 02:22:14.447]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:22:14.787 --> 02:22:16.709]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:22:16.809 --> 02:22:18.090]  So they think they own our land?
[02:22:18.510 --> 02:22:19.631]  They think they own our water?
[02:22:19.811 --> 02:22:20.212]  Children?
[02:22:20.432 --> 02:22:21.213]  Our education?
[02:22:21.553 --> 02:22:22.193]  Our money?
[02:22:22.374 --> 02:22:26.037]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:22:26.377 --> 02:22:30.042]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:22:30.102 --> 02:22:31.044]  You're being warned!
[02:22:31.364 --> 02:22:32.185]  We have the facts.
[02:22:32.385 --> 02:22:33.507]  We have the Constitution.
[02:22:33.547 --> 02:22:34.428]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:22:34.448 --> 02:22:35.289]  We have common law.
[02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:37.592]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:37.873 --> 02:22:41.638]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:22:41.738 --> 02:22:46.519]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:22:46.699 --> 02:22:48.060]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:49.040]  Don't tread on me.

[02:24:01.757 --> 02:24:06.901]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:07.562 --> 02:24:09.844]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:15.583 --> 02:24:21.067]  Alright, we're going to open the phones up in the next segment on the Food Safety Act passing the Senate.
[02:24:21.868 --> 02:24:23.089]  Will it pass the House?
[02:24:23.109 --> 02:24:24.810]  This thing is so draconian.
[02:24:25.350 --> 02:24:33.677]  It's a complete open ticket for the federal government to do whatever they want.
[02:24:33.717 --> 02:24:34.737]  It's just a license to
[02:24:35.876 --> 02:24:38.657]  engage in total authoritarian domination.
[02:24:39.317 --> 02:24:47.961]  Same thing that they're trying to pass with this copyright act that openly says the federal government can shut down any website they want.
[02:24:48.021 --> 02:24:52.022]  No judge, no jury, no nothing, no appeal.
[02:24:52.782 --> 02:24:54.203]  It's just the end of law.
[02:24:57.104 --> 02:24:58.745]  I want to get your take on the economy.
[02:24:58.825 --> 02:25:01.886]  I want to get your take on all these other things that are happening.
[02:25:02.906 --> 02:25:04.467]  But first I want to play a video.
[02:25:05.694 --> 02:25:09.395]  That is so extremely powerful, and we're going to do that after the break.
[02:25:09.935 --> 02:25:23.660]  And the article that has the video posted in it is, Americans are willing to trample on one another to get their hands on cheap foreign-made plastic garbage, even as the United States turns into a post-industrial wasteland.
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:30.962]  From the American Dream blog, we have it again posted on PrisonPlanet.com, in the commentary area.
[02:25:32.185 --> 02:25:36.427]  And they point out what is evident to anyone that understands what's happening.
[02:25:37.527 --> 02:25:41.869]  That Americans, on average, have turned into blobs.
[02:25:42.989 --> 02:25:48.091]  Have turned into people that see themselves as like being children who just follow government rules.
[02:25:49.311 --> 02:25:56.374]  And that life is all about satiating our bellies, our sex drive, our lust for entertainment.
[02:25:57.418 --> 02:26:03.400]  But if you study the different psychological indexes that have been done in the surveys, people are more unhappy than ever.
[02:26:04.220 --> 02:26:22.046]  If life is nothing but entertainment, and sex, and drugs, and grazing, you know, a type of twisted, hunter-gatherer, modern version of hunting and gathering,
[02:26:24.807 --> 02:26:28.393]  Where people just go to malls and just buy things to buy it.
[02:26:28.413 --> 02:26:37.069]  You ever seen a child who really wants a toy when they're reading a catalog, and when you get them the toy, they're excited, they open it, they put it together, never touch it again?
[02:26:41.087 --> 02:26:50.253]  But then toys where they have to be creative, like Legos, or painting, or erector sets, they never get tired of those.
[02:26:50.854 --> 02:26:53.416]  But the big, fancy, flashy toy, they don't use it.
[02:26:53.996 --> 02:26:55.517]  And it's the same thing with video games.
[02:26:55.637 --> 02:26:57.378]  I'm not attacking people that play video games.
[02:26:57.719 --> 02:27:00.821]  I played my fair share in, you know, junior high and high school.
[02:27:01.301 --> 02:27:04.824]  It's just there are more important things to do in the real world.
[02:27:05.224 --> 02:27:07.546]  And when we only get obsessed with
[02:27:08.677 --> 02:27:09.598]  That's false reality.
[02:27:09.638 --> 02:27:17.824]  They have all these big video games, these communal games, where there's millions of people playing them at one time, where people pay real money for a Ferrari.
[02:27:18.265 --> 02:27:20.166]  They pay real money for a girlfriend.
[02:27:20.787 --> 02:27:29.153]  They pay real money for a mansion in cyberspace, and people get obsessed with it.
[02:27:29.934 --> 02:27:32.136]  People get totally
[02:27:33.373 --> 02:27:34.233]  Preoccupied
[02:27:54.500 --> 02:28:10.515]  involved in the real world they're being sucked into the corporate manufactured Hollywood death machine that's killing our culture to the point of a lot of people can't even get upset by the TSA sticking their hands down their pants.
[02:28:13.398 --> 02:28:15.080]  And it's just that simple.
[02:28:18.243 --> 02:28:19.203]  I was talking to a
[02:28:22.321 --> 02:28:32.908]  Psychologists yesterday, off air, and they were pointing out that people are in a trance.
[02:28:33.088 --> 02:28:42.414]  If you study the brainwaves of the average Westerner, going back over the last 50 years, the brainwave activity is much lower.
[02:28:42.474 --> 02:28:46.516]  It's not just chemical, with the fluoride and the GMO foods and all the rest of the poisons.
[02:28:47.717 --> 02:28:50.459]  When you watch television, it's not interactive.
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:52.061]  It's one way.
[02:28:53.363 --> 02:28:59.392]  And the brain stops connecting new synapses, and the brainwaves lower.
[02:28:59.812 --> 02:29:02.897]  The same thing happens with video games, even though it's semi-interactive.
[02:29:04.904 --> 02:29:09.587]  And the brainwaves begin to lower in people that watch multiple hours of TV a day.
[02:29:10.267 --> 02:29:22.274]  By the end of a, say, 2-3 hour television session, where you catch yourself in a trance and drooling, your brainwaves lower, not just into a sleep mode, you're literally mesmerized sleepwalking.
[02:29:22.294 --> 02:29:22.914]  This is a fact.
[02:29:23.454 --> 02:29:27.417]  You are now in a oxygen-starved level.
[02:29:28.357 --> 02:29:31.658]  That people rarely have in deep, deep sleeps.
[02:29:31.718 --> 02:29:34.018]  You are now in a near-death experience.
[02:29:34.338 --> 02:29:35.418]  That's mainstream news.
[02:29:37.699 --> 02:29:43.700]  So, many adults now are unable to even communicate.
[02:29:43.860 --> 02:29:47.721]  That's why when you talk to them and you bring up an issue, it seems like they're in a trance.
[02:29:48.061 --> 02:29:49.381]  They are in a trance.
[02:29:49.481 --> 02:29:50.061]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:51.022 --> 02:29:51.922]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.402 --> 02:29:54.022]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.942 --> 02:29:57.623]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.862 --> 02:30:02.464]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[02:30:54.198 --> 02:30:54.659]  Thank you!
[02:31:00.401 --> 02:31:04.644]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.964 --> 02:31:05.565]  Number 1.
[02:31:05.865 --> 02:31:09.027]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.308 --> 02:31:09.848]  Number 2.
[02:31:10.168 --> 02:31:14.712]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.052 --> 02:31:15.492]  It's true.
[02:31:15.792 --> 02:31:20.356]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.676 --> 02:31:21.216]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.497 --> 02:31:24.779]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.079 --> 02:31:28.782]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:28.982 --> 02:31:29.523]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.783 --> 02:31:32.145]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.545 --> 02:31:35.929]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.209 --> 02:31:36.429]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.010 --> 02:31:40.933]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.153 --> 02:31:45.918]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:00.187 --> 02:32:03.829]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[02:32:04.029 --> 02:32:08.052]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:32:08.292 --> 02:32:12.874]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:32:12.995 --> 02:32:14.856]  I'm looking for a factory
[02:32:15.656 --> 02:32:16.957]  We're American and be proud.
[02:32:16.977 --> 02:32:20.878]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:32:41.622 --> 02:32:49.546]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:33:09.504 --> 02:33:11.828]  We are back live ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:23.746 --> 02:33:25.126]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:33:25.146 --> 02:33:25.206]  800-259-9231.
[02:33:25.226 --> 02:33:30.388]  We'll take seven or eight of your calls the time we have left here with your questions, your comments on all that's happening.
[02:33:30.448 --> 02:33:32.528]  I've got some other news I want to hit on as well.
[02:33:43.177 --> 02:33:45.339]  I saw a video embedded in this article.
[02:33:45.720 --> 02:33:54.809]  Americans are willing to trample on one another to get their hands on cheap foreign-made plastic garbage, even as the United States turns into a post-industrial wasteland.
[02:33:55.429 --> 02:34:00.454]  And the video put out on this YouTube channel is very powerful.
[02:34:01.825 --> 02:34:05.767]  It's SGTBull07 is the channel, but that's hard to remember.
[02:34:06.368 --> 02:34:10.030]  The name of the video is The Madness of a Lost Society.
[02:34:10.930 --> 02:34:14.012]  And I watched quite a few of the videos on this channel today.
[02:34:14.032 --> 02:34:15.313]  I thought they were very impressive.
[02:34:16.033 --> 02:34:21.676]  And this person really has a way with words to crystallize complex issues simply.
[02:34:21.957 --> 02:34:26.019]  So I say bravo to the director and the person that is putting these videos together.
[02:34:26.339 --> 02:34:27.580]  Keep up the great work.
[02:34:28.460 --> 02:34:34.584]  Let's go ahead and also want to make sure that we post this video by itself on Infowars.com.
[02:34:35.065 --> 02:34:37.746]  The Madness of a Lost Society, so it's easy for folks to find it.
[02:34:38.027 --> 02:34:42.430]  I know it's on Prison Planet, but halfway down the page, buried in an article.
[02:34:42.730 --> 02:34:49.955]  I want to get this up for everybody, but here is the video and the audio for radio listeners, and it really illustrates
[02:34:50.475 --> 02:34:52.136]  What's happened to our society.
[02:34:52.176 --> 02:34:59.698]  But if you are just a radio listener, not a PrisonPlanet.TV viewer, I suggest you do go to PrisonPlanet.com, link through to this video and watch it.
[02:35:00.018 --> 02:35:12.123]  Because seeing people rioting and climbing over each other to get cheap Chinese slave goods, they should be getting physically involved in the streets taking our country back.
[02:35:14.568 --> 02:35:23.457]  And he also makes the point of, if this country goes the way of Argentina, and that's where we're headed, can you imagine how these folks are going to burn down every major U.S.
[02:35:23.497 --> 02:35:25.238]  city demanding their welfare checks?
[02:35:25.519 --> 02:35:26.640]  Here's the video and the audio.
[02:35:27.748 --> 02:35:29.889]  The madness of a lost society.
[02:35:30.709 --> 02:35:31.850]  November 26, 2010.
[02:35:33.251 --> 02:35:39.894]  Black Friday revealed yet further evidence of the complete madness of the populace of our lost society.
[02:35:40.154 --> 02:35:40.955]  Kids, you didn't hear?
[02:35:40.975 --> 02:35:42.735]  The leaders of China and Russia.
[02:35:42.915 --> 02:35:45.977]  China and Russia said that they are renouncing the dollar.
[02:35:46.017 --> 02:35:48.478]  The best way to think of it is a ticking time bomb.
[02:35:48.818 --> 02:35:51.120]  At some stage, the dollar will fall sharply.
[02:35:51.180 --> 02:35:53.921]  Now you might be saying, Neil, what the heck does this mean to me?
[02:35:54.241 --> 02:36:08.908]  As the dollar loses status as the world's reserve currency, as mystery missiles launch just off our shores, as North and South Korea take the world to the brink of war, as the TSA violates all measure of liberty and constitutional rights, and as the U.S.
[02:36:08.968 --> 02:36:16.912]  military itself prepares for the coming total economic collapse and breakdown of civil order, this is what Americans care about.
[02:36:17.593 --> 02:36:19.774]  Wanton, lustful commercialism.
[02:36:20.154 --> 02:36:24.597]  Acting like animals fighting over trinkets made by human beings for slave wages.
[02:36:25.117 --> 02:36:30.440]  As you watch this horrific video, do you think any of these people own a single ounce of physical precious metal?
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:31.261]  Any gold?
[02:36:31.761 --> 02:36:32.361]  Any silver?
[02:36:32.822 --> 02:36:36.384]  Do you think that even one of them understands what the Federal Reserve is?
[02:36:36.644 --> 02:36:40.306]  Or that the Fed is spending them into oblivion and economic slavery?
[02:36:40.546 --> 02:36:46.613]  Do you think even one among them has made any preparations at all for the day when there is no food on grocery store shelves?
[02:36:46.973 --> 02:36:50.857]  And do you think the morally bankrupt executives at Target or Walmart even care?
[02:36:51.438 --> 02:36:52.779]  This is what we've become.
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:37:01.509]  A decadent, mindless culture who by virtue of this complete and willful ignorance are now officially complicit in the crimes being perpetrated against us.
[02:37:01.849 --> 02:37:16.575]  Do you think these people who behave like animals, literally trampling each other over $198 laptops and $10 toasters, will even pause for a moment to consider their actions before they riot and burn entire cities when the days of hyperinflation finally arrive?
[02:37:16.935 --> 02:37:18.616]  When the grocery stores are bare?
[02:37:18.876 --> 02:37:20.757]  When they are truly desperate?
[02:37:21.017 --> 02:37:25.779]  This, my friends, is what a dumbed-down, morally bankrupt, completely broken society looks like.
[02:37:25.939 --> 02:37:27.500]  And this is how it behaves.
[02:37:28.220 --> 02:37:30.121]  No outrage over the bankers raping them.
[02:37:30.522 --> 02:37:32.623]  No outrage over their gutted industry.
[02:37:32.943 --> 02:37:34.964]  No outrage over their plundered dollar.
[02:37:35.465 --> 02:37:38.266]  Just blind, wanton stupidity.
[02:37:38.827 --> 02:37:40.468]  Just bread and circuses.
[02:37:41.008 --> 02:37:47.052]  The elite are social Darwinists, and they believe what they can get away with is fair game as long as we allow it.
[02:37:47.292 --> 02:37:50.854]  This is social engineering, and they've done it to us by design.
[02:37:50.974 --> 02:37:53.256]  They've turned us into animals that they can corral.
[02:37:53.536 --> 02:37:58.139]  We are no longer citizens in a republic safeguarded by our elected representatives.
[02:37:58.279 --> 02:38:02.543]  We are consumers feeding in a corporate trough managed by officials.
[02:38:02.883 --> 02:38:09.808]  Will you tell the American people to whom you lent 2.2 trillion of their dollars?
[02:38:10.308 --> 02:38:14.791]  Hundreds and hundreds of banks, any bank that has access to the U.S.
[02:38:15.152 --> 02:38:16.012]  Federal Reserve System.
[02:38:16.092 --> 02:38:16.873]  Tell us who they are.
[02:38:18.041 --> 02:38:18.201]  No.
[02:38:18.722 --> 02:38:21.443]  If this is America, who will stop them?
[02:38:21.824 --> 02:38:25.046]  Our entire system is corrupt and needs to be dismantled and begun anew.
[02:38:25.326 --> 02:38:26.387]  But from what base?
[02:38:26.967 --> 02:38:34.712]  If what happened on Friday across America is any indication of the condition of the American populace, then our very foundations are built of sand.
[02:38:35.192 --> 02:38:39.515]  May God forgive us for what we've become and for what we've allowed to happen to our nation.
[02:38:40.016 --> 02:38:47.361]  And may those of us with the courage and sense to do it renounce this behavior and the monstrous marketing ploy that is Black Friday.
[02:38:48.061 --> 02:38:48.882]  In its entirety.
[02:38:49.202 --> 02:38:51.103]  This, my friends, is not us.
[02:38:53.345 --> 02:38:54.886]  We are the Republic.
[02:38:55.346 --> 02:38:56.967]  We are the informed.
[02:38:57.207 --> 02:38:59.229]  We are the proactive ones.
[02:38:59.369 --> 02:39:02.311]  And it is our job to lift up those who are lost.
[02:39:02.791 --> 02:39:05.713]  And saving our Republic is a full-time job.
[02:39:06.534 --> 02:39:08.215]  May God bless the Republic.
[02:39:10.376 --> 02:39:13.659]  Thanks for watching The Madness of a Lost Society.
[02:39:15.871 --> 02:39:21.013]  Wow, great voiceover, great material, great information, great video selects.
[02:39:21.613 --> 02:39:26.695]  And I know there are millions of people out there who can even top that, that can top what I'm doing.
[02:39:27.655 --> 02:39:33.377]  Recently, one of the biggest newspapers, magazines in the country was here for a big cover story they're doing in February.
[02:39:35.198 --> 02:39:37.038]  And they asked where I want to go in the future.
[02:39:38.019 --> 02:39:45.081]  I want to be able to see so many other people more articulate, more focused, more skilled than I.
[02:39:48.883 --> 02:39:53.445]  out there fighting the globalist that I can literally quit and shut all this down.
[02:39:54.625 --> 02:39:55.146]  That's my goal.
[02:39:55.626 --> 02:39:56.826]  I don't want to be doing this.
[02:39:58.327 --> 02:40:01.608]  It is invigorating, it is empowering, it's also exhausting.
[02:40:04.289 --> 02:40:15.554]  And if there were 10, 20 other people who were as well-spoken, focused, dedicated, and who weren't in fighting with each other, I would quit.
[02:40:15.774 --> 02:40:16.314]  I'd be gone.
[02:40:17.795 --> 02:40:18.375]  I would literally
[02:40:20.936 --> 02:40:30.001]  Transfer my entire operation to someone better than I. Now, sure, that's a great video, and on that channel there's a whole bunch of well-done videos.
[02:40:31.202 --> 02:40:33.923]  And that's that individual, obviously, probably in their part-time.
[02:40:34.243 --> 02:40:37.825]  They've got to work, whatever their profession is, putting that material together.
[02:40:40.266 --> 02:40:42.087]  But all of you could do what they've done.
[02:40:43.848 --> 02:40:50.052]  All of you could try to get to a point, make a film, get the funding to quit your regular job and be a full-time info warrior.
[02:40:50.836 --> 02:40:51.417]  You could do it!
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:55.841]  And I have looked.
[02:40:55.941 --> 02:40:57.343]  I've tried to look for other leaders.
[02:40:57.383 --> 02:40:59.164]  I've tried to have other people on air and build them up.
[02:40:59.265 --> 02:41:04.330]  I've found people that aren't mentally ill, who aren't in this to be stars, but not that many.
[02:41:05.768 --> 02:41:09.769]  Most people that get into this fight against the New World Order at a prominent level are egomaniacs.
[02:41:10.510 --> 02:41:14.731]  And they're completely obsessed and jealous of who I am and what I do.
[02:41:15.191 --> 02:41:21.153]  When I have a pretty low view of myself, it's hard getting up here and talking for three hours a day and staying focused and being articulate.
[02:41:21.534 --> 02:41:22.654]  I don't have teleprompters.
[02:41:24.575 --> 02:41:25.295]  And it's scary.
[02:41:25.335 --> 02:41:28.076]  It's one of the most frustrating things out there that I'm the best there is.
[02:41:29.957 --> 02:41:34.559]  People take my confidence, my anger, my commitment, my focus as ego.
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:35.400]  It is not ego.
[02:41:35.860 --> 02:41:37.201]  My ego has been crushed.
[02:41:37.941 --> 02:41:42.744]  It has almost completely evaporated in really realizing what we're up against.
[02:41:43.204 --> 02:41:46.706]  Knowing they're poisoning our food and water, knowing that we're going into pure tyranny.
[02:41:47.246 --> 02:41:53.470]  I mean, I'm not thinking about people thinking I'm cool at a restaurant or getting to hang out with Hollywood people.
[02:41:53.710 --> 02:41:57.652]  I guess it's because I've done it that I realize that
[02:41:59.534 --> 02:42:13.145]  I don't want to say it's not fulfilling, because a lot of these people I've met are cool and enjoy freedom and I like them because of that, but it's people that think that if they were rich, if they were powerful, if they ran in powerful circles, that they would be fulfilled.
[02:42:13.905 --> 02:42:20.291]  And I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, it is not fulfilling, unless you're standing up for widows and orphans.
[02:42:20.931 --> 02:42:22.393]  Unless you're standing up for the truth.
[02:42:22.773 --> 02:42:24.415]  Unless you're standing up for human dignity.
[02:42:24.975 --> 02:42:29.180]  I really am upset about the neurological disorders off the charts.
[02:42:29.420 --> 02:42:30.781]  The diabetes off the charts.
[02:42:31.142 --> 02:42:32.503]  The poisons in the vaccines.
[02:42:33.044 --> 02:42:39.390]  I empathize when I see adults at a Walgreens lined up with their kids, shooting them up with vaccines.
[02:42:40.711 --> 02:42:42.013]  I actually say something to them.
[02:42:44.778 --> 02:42:54.365]  I was sitting there at Thanksgiving, and there was a bunch of family over in East Texas, and I had to hear about how they had the vaccine pushed on them at the store, and so they went ahead and got it.
[02:42:54.926 --> 02:42:57.207]  And I had to sit there and warn that family.
[02:42:59.449 --> 02:43:03.332]  And, you know, I had to sit there and hear them kind of go, oh, the government wouldn't hurt me.
[02:43:03.372 --> 02:43:04.253]  And I had to say, really?
[02:43:04.293 --> 02:43:06.054]  Like all the people they shot up with syphilis?
[02:43:06.755 --> 02:43:08.056]  You know, grow up, man!
[02:43:08.096 --> 02:43:10.317]  You think I'm sitting here telling you this for fun?
[02:43:10.618 --> 02:43:13.420]  I've been sitting here for hours at Thanksgiving and haven't even talked!
[02:43:15.322 --> 02:43:17.884]  I don't particularly need to sit here and show off for you!
[02:43:18.264 --> 02:43:22.346]  When somebody's warning you about something, it doesn't mean they're trying to act like you're stupid.
[02:43:22.546 --> 02:43:23.627]  I'm trying to warn you!
[02:43:23.647 --> 02:43:25.228]  I didn't say it like that.
[02:43:25.288 --> 02:43:28.430]  I just said, listen, you better look into what's in those shots.
[02:43:36.455 --> 02:43:41.558]  The real response would have probably been to just turn the entire table over and say, research vaccines!
[02:43:41.938 --> 02:43:42.999]  Stop killing yourself!
[02:43:44.008 --> 02:43:53.190]  If you saw somebody rushing out in front of traffic on an interstate highway and they wouldn't listen to you, were standing out there about to be run over, wouldn't you go push them out of the way?
[02:43:53.210 --> 02:43:57.151]  And if they tried to get back out in traffic, you'd probably have to go ahead and punch them.
[02:43:58.031 --> 02:44:04.212]  I mean, you know, we've got to start recognizing these attacks for what they are, hardcore and serious, man.
[02:44:04.432 --> 02:44:06.953]  We've got to really get serious here.
[02:44:07.933 --> 02:44:08.753]  This isn't a game.
[02:44:12.059 --> 02:44:13.480]  And I've tried to build up so many people.
[02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:31.935]  I've tried to have other people on the show and build up their radio shows and their websites and in almost every case they like make stuff up about me and flip out and try to attack thinking if they could do something to me that they then be big stars and they never produce any real material or work and they just ninny and fight with each other and we have no future if we don't beat these globalists.
[02:44:32.535 --> 02:44:39.401]  I mean the globalists are able to beat us because we are those slobs trampling each other at Walmart and Target for crud.
[02:44:42.056 --> 02:44:54.759]  Let me tell you, if they had a video, you know, with David Rockefeller admitting he's a eugenicist and then he wants to kill us, I'd be in line for a week with a tent, trying to get in the door to get the video to make sure it got out.
[02:44:55.759 --> 02:45:10.262]  But I... I mean, standing there in line, desperate... I can see people standing in line, ready to fight each other over land grants being given thousands of acres,
[02:45:11.425 --> 02:45:14.287]  You know, in the past, when the federal government got land, they said, here, come take it.
[02:45:14.307 --> 02:45:16.388]  Because they knew the people would make wealth on the land.
[02:45:16.668 --> 02:45:18.009]  Now they don't want you to have land.
[02:45:18.149 --> 02:45:19.330]  They don't want you to have wealth.
[02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:20.831]  They want you to be dependent on them.
[02:45:23.553 --> 02:45:29.217]  They will trample and they will fight each other over junk that breaks as soon as they take it out of the box.
[02:45:31.478 --> 02:45:33.699]  Like they're finding their salvation in those stores.
[02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:36.882]  And I'm not saying buying things and selling things is bad.
[02:45:38.041 --> 02:45:45.890]  I'm saying worshipping it, having it as the ultimate thing in your life, and then not caring about the really serious things in life is destructive.
[02:45:47.572 --> 02:45:50.014]  You know, some woman running out and going, woohoo, I got it!
[02:45:50.375 --> 02:45:51.516]  I got in front of people!
[02:45:51.696 --> 02:45:54.720]  I got $10 off on the Chinese slave goods!
[02:45:56.522 --> 02:45:58.324]  Alright, I said I'd take your calls and I'm ranting.
[02:45:58.944 --> 02:45:59.285]  It's just...
[02:46:01.229 --> 02:46:10.033]  A lot of people see the bad in humanity and they give up on humanity and they hate their fellow man and the elite see us as fat, stupid, dumb people and they want to kill us.
[02:46:11.954 --> 02:46:13.274]  And I want to build people up.
[02:46:13.434 --> 02:46:14.555]  I want to reach out to folks.
[02:46:14.595 --> 02:46:18.596]  Just because other people are cruddy and bad doesn't mean that I'm going to be cruddy and bad.
[02:46:19.217 --> 02:46:20.517]  I want to try to lift people up.
[02:46:20.657 --> 02:46:22.178]  I don't want to give up on our species.
[02:46:25.759 --> 02:46:27.160]  This is coming down to the wire now.
[02:46:28.442 --> 02:46:31.483]  We're coming down to the wire now on this.
[02:46:33.084 --> 02:46:35.045]  And stuff's going to get real bad real quick.
[02:46:35.065 --> 02:46:36.145]  You've already seen what's happened.
[02:46:36.505 --> 02:46:38.106]  Exactly as we said, we've studied history.
[02:46:38.286 --> 02:46:39.207]  We've studied the globalists.
[02:46:43.314 --> 02:46:44.275]  I just want to stop it.
[02:46:44.996 --> 02:46:52.482]  But even if we don't stop it, at least we're going to have hundreds of millions of people worldwide, tens of millions in the United States, who really know the score.
[02:46:53.183 --> 02:47:02.692]  We've got a chance to then beat the globalists once no one can deny what's happening, and we'll have a brain trust to rebuild the republic and a free society.
[02:47:03.473 --> 02:47:04.894]  We know if we give in, it's over.
[02:47:07.645 --> 02:47:15.512]  And we know the globalists are using this giant mob of dumbed-down fluoride heads as a political weapon against those of us that are awake and decent.
[02:47:16.392 --> 02:47:24.339]  So you've got to reach out to the blobs, even though they're disgusting and ignorant and giggle at you like a mentally ill child, and love their slavery.
[02:47:24.359 --> 02:47:27.681]  You've still got to warn them, because some of them can be woken up.
[02:47:29.083 --> 02:47:31.485]  Because they're dangerous hog goblins.
[02:47:31.885 --> 02:47:32.826]  You just saw the video.
[02:47:34.977 --> 02:47:36.538]  Let's go ahead and talk to Milton in New York.
[02:47:36.598 --> 02:47:38.440]  Milton, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:40.041]  Hello, Alex.
[02:47:41.682 --> 02:48:01.218]  I was wondering, in regard to the government control and crackdown on the Internet, I was wondering what is your take on the IRS 6050W that applies to literally all Internet commerce now?
[02:48:02.076 --> 02:48:10.019]  Yeah, I know they're wanting everybody to have to create a record of it and give it to the government and anything over $600, you've got to get a, which will just shut down commerce.
[02:48:10.959 --> 02:48:12.820]  You've got to give them a tax form to track it.
[02:48:13.660 --> 02:48:16.522]  And it's just more, more, more, more, more.
[02:48:17.402 --> 02:48:19.863]  And it'll just shut down our economy that much faster.
[02:48:19.883 --> 02:48:20.503]  I think it's horrible.
[02:48:21.564 --> 02:48:27.826]  Under 6050W, what it is also is that online sellers
[02:48:29.299 --> 02:48:39.306]  If they sell $20,000 or more or run 200 transactions, they're subject to 1099 starting January 2011.
[02:48:39.426 --> 02:48:41.707]  Yeah, that's what I was talking about.
[02:48:41.868 --> 02:48:45.710]  And they've got in the health care bill a whole bunch of stuff tracking everything.
[02:48:45.750 --> 02:48:48.512]  I mean, listen, they're announcing the austerity.
[02:48:48.532 --> 02:48:49.913]  We're about a year behind Europe.
[02:48:50.453 --> 02:48:53.956]  The pension funds, the veterans health care, they're coming for everything.
[02:48:54.716 --> 02:48:57.978]  And they've got fake conservatives on the news going, yeah, we've got to cut the government.
[02:48:58.558 --> 02:49:05.341]  But they're only cutting areas of the budget, not of the $1,500 trillion plus in derivatives.
[02:49:06.042 --> 02:49:08.523]  That's 99 plus percent of the problem.
[02:49:09.784 --> 02:49:11.225]  All the other stuff is window dressing.
[02:49:11.465 --> 02:49:12.605]  What do you think about all this?
[02:49:14.146 --> 02:49:19.008]  I think the IRS is undergoing a major crackdown.
[02:49:21.031 --> 02:49:25.113]  They're doing everything they can to plug up every hole that they possibly can.
[02:49:25.653 --> 02:49:34.217]  In fact, I even heard, was it Rush yesterday, talking about new IRS regulations on tax preparers.
[02:49:34.777 --> 02:49:36.197]  Yeah, they already did that five years ago.
[02:49:36.257 --> 02:49:41.980]  Now they're accelerating it, where the tax preparers will not sign off on mainline tax
[02:49:43.060 --> 02:49:51.365]  Uh, write-offs, and now CPA's job is just to give all your money, more than you even owe under the fraudulent system of the Federal Reserve, give it all to them.
[02:49:51.405 --> 02:49:53.946]  Yes, it's just a total raping.
[02:49:54.427 --> 02:49:58.949]  But then they write the rules where Google and Microsoft pay 2.4% tax.
[02:50:00.030 --> 02:50:08.395]  But then you, you know, who owns a car dealership or a restaurant, when they're done with you, they've gotten rid of most of the write-offs, the average person's paying about 40%.
[02:50:10.526 --> 02:50:10.746]  Uh-huh.
[02:50:10.986 --> 02:50:15.947]  And I think that this is a direct frontal assault on the middle class in particular.
[02:50:16.207 --> 02:50:16.987]  Oh, absolutely!
[02:50:17.007 --> 02:50:21.068]  And then they've got all these shows on ABC with Bill Gates saying, raise taxes on rich.
[02:50:21.628 --> 02:50:23.529]  He's not, that's not the billionaires.
[02:50:23.569 --> 02:50:26.669]  That's the guy down the street that's got 20 employees.
[02:50:27.249 --> 02:50:28.710]  And, because they want him out of there.
[02:50:28.990 --> 02:50:30.210]  They want a wasteland.
[02:50:30.490 --> 02:50:31.670]  This is economic warfare.
[02:50:31.730 --> 02:50:32.490]  They admit it.
[02:50:35.111 --> 02:50:35.411]  Oh, boy.
[02:50:37.261 --> 02:50:37.861]  Thank you, Milton.
[02:50:38.142 --> 02:50:38.642]  Thank you, Milton.
[02:50:38.662 --> 02:50:39.483]  We're out of time there.
[02:50:39.523 --> 02:50:43.085]  I'm going to talk to Bill, Al-Qaeda, Bobby, Patriot.
[02:50:43.105 --> 02:50:44.466]  We'll try to jam you all in on the other side.
[02:50:44.486 --> 02:50:45.607]  Have your comments or questions ready.
[02:50:45.667 --> 02:50:48.549]  I'm going to try to come back tomorrow and the next day and take more calls.
[02:50:48.930 --> 02:50:50.591]  We may have some shows this week that are all calls.
[02:50:50.611 --> 02:50:52.092]  We've got a bunch of guests coming up as well.
[02:50:52.132 --> 02:50:53.153]  It's just all insane.
[02:50:53.933 --> 02:50:56.715]  Google's trying to censor us and shut us down on every front.
[02:50:57.075 --> 02:50:58.336]  But it's because we're effective.
[02:50:58.376 --> 02:50:59.998]  So, redouble your efforts.
[02:51:00.891 --> 02:51:03.214]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:51:03.274 --> 02:51:05.496]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:51:05.596 --> 02:51:08.360]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:51:08.820 --> 02:51:13.546]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:51:13.926 --> 02:51:18.111]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:51:18.411 --> 02:51:20.755]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:51:20.775 --> 02:51:23.299]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:51:23.659 --> 02:51:26.223]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:51:26.563 --> 02:51:34.175]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:51:34.508 --> 02:51:39.750]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:51:39.870 --> 02:51:42.690]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:51:42.730 --> 02:51:46.171]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:51:46.411 --> 02:51:47.332]  And I got news for you.
[02:51:47.492 --> 02:51:48.812]  You're everyone else.
[02:51:48.832 --> 02:51:49.832]  Invisible Empire.

[02:52:00.140 --> 02:52:03.423]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:52:04.224 --> 02:52:08.469]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:52:08.729 --> 02:52:14.675]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:52:14.895 --> 02:52:17.057]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:52:17.338 --> 02:52:23.304]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:52:23.424 --> 02:52:26.746]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:52:26.826 --> 02:52:28.527]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:52:28.687 --> 02:52:30.748]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.

[02:53:00.775 --> 02:53:05.078]  Fight back this cold and flu season with the world's best garlic extract, Ali-C.
[02:53:05.238 --> 02:53:06.039]  Why Ali-C?
[02:53:06.099 --> 02:53:09.482]  Because it helps your body fight viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
[02:53:09.682 --> 02:53:17.348]  Ali-C has been scientifically proven in double-blind studies using low doses to greatly reduce the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[02:53:17.728 --> 02:53:23.111]  Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[02:53:23.311 --> 02:53:27.973]  Studies show Ali-C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[02:53:28.513 --> 02:53:31.875]  One tablet of Ali-C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.

[02:54:10.336 --> 02:54:16.538]  We've become an evil, swan-like culture on average, and so we're being overrun by even more evil people on top.
[02:54:16.998 --> 02:54:19.839]  Get ready, because we're inside the New World Order now.
[02:54:21.240 --> 02:54:23.661]  Bill in Florida, you're on the air, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:54:23.681 --> 02:54:26.101]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[02:54:26.161 --> 02:54:27.182]  Pretty good, sir.
[02:54:27.782 --> 02:54:39.646]  I admire you, and I will say that God is graciously looking over you, because you are doing a job that I don't think many would sacrifice their time, their family, and all the rest for.
[02:54:40.898 --> 02:54:42.779]  I sent an email to Aaron.
[02:54:43.739 --> 02:54:51.662]  I wanted you to take a peek at the Senate payoffs or campaign contributions, the list that I forwarded to you.
[02:54:52.243 --> 02:54:53.703]  It's from a Florida address.
[02:54:54.924 --> 02:55:04.427]  It's quite amazing what poured into the Senate for this S-510 up until the 20th of November.
[02:55:05.568 --> 02:55:08.269]  Let me guess, it's big agribusiness?
[02:55:09.241 --> 02:55:11.282]  To the tune of about 12 million dollars.
[02:55:12.523 --> 02:55:15.584]  That was just up until the 20th of November.
[02:55:15.965 --> 02:55:17.445]  Now, did you mail that or email it?
[02:55:18.186 --> 02:55:18.766]  I emailed it.
[02:55:18.926 --> 02:55:20.207]  What was the title of your email?
[02:55:20.227 --> 02:55:21.507]  Because that's an important story.
[02:55:21.528 --> 02:55:27.931]  I mean, I've already seen articles months ago that Big Agra wrote the bill, but I'd like to show folks who donated for it.
[02:55:27.951 --> 02:55:31.593]  Because the media is like, this will get Big Agra that keeps poisoning you.
[02:55:31.873 --> 02:55:33.494]  No, this shuts down their competition.
[02:55:34.275 --> 02:55:35.797]  Exactly, exactly right.
[02:55:36.397 --> 02:55:44.306]  The email, it might just say emailed from a friend, but the name that sent it, I put in Senate 510.
[02:55:45.908 --> 02:55:46.989]  When did you send the email?
[02:55:48.731 --> 02:55:50.252]  Within the last 30 minutes.
[02:55:50.893 --> 02:55:52.615]  Okay, I'll get Aaron on it right now.
[02:55:52.635 --> 02:55:53.316]  Thank you so much.
[02:55:53.356 --> 02:55:54.177]  What else is on your mind, Bill?
[02:55:55.115 --> 02:55:59.816]  Um, the other thing is that, you know, the awareness really needs to get out there.
[02:55:59.836 --> 02:56:01.076]  They slipped this under the thing.
[02:56:01.116 --> 02:56:05.817]  There was a very good movie that dealt into it not long ago with George Clooney.
[02:56:06.997 --> 02:56:08.778]  Michael Clayton was the name of the movie.
[02:56:09.038 --> 02:56:10.258]  That's excellent, excellent.
[02:56:10.278 --> 02:56:12.558]  Where they try to kill the lawyer, yeah.
[02:56:12.638 --> 02:56:14.279]  That's really about Monsanto, sure.
[02:56:15.019 --> 02:56:16.139]  That's exactly right.
[02:56:16.299 --> 02:56:20.620]  And I would say to the people that they really need to go rent the movie.
[02:56:22.142 --> 02:56:23.182]  Let's see what that's about.
[02:56:24.823 --> 02:56:33.106]  I got inspired a little while ago because I watched a tape of you and Judge Napolitano from just a few days ago, him talking about Building 7 with you.
[02:56:34.006 --> 02:56:40.208]  And I will tell you this, I was born and raised in Manhattan and a little outside of Manhattan.
[02:56:40.248 --> 02:56:42.649]  My dad had a restaurant business there for about 30 years.
[02:56:43.329 --> 02:56:44.449]  I grew up as a kid there.
[02:56:44.509 --> 02:56:46.290]  My dad became an elder in a church.
[02:56:47.270 --> 02:56:53.451]  And there was a fellow elder who was an engineer on the World Trade Centers.
[02:56:54.071 --> 02:56:57.012]  And I'm going to go document this stuff and I'm going to forward it to you.
[02:56:58.272 --> 02:57:06.734]  The engineer, there was a big story, the reason why the two buildings, and they never covered it in 9-1-1, why the two buildings didn't get simultaneously finished.
[02:57:06.774 --> 02:57:08.574]  They were supposed to be finished at the same time.
[02:57:09.074 --> 02:57:16.876]  There was in fact a huge, a very large schooner that was discovered, kind of like the little blurb that they showed today when they were re-excavating.
[02:57:17.455 --> 02:57:24.620]  But the New York Port Authority shut down the site because of the value of it, and they literally pulled up an entire schooner.
[02:57:24.660 --> 02:57:25.900]  It was a three-masted schooner.
[02:57:26.001 --> 02:57:27.441]  Well, listen, we're out of time.
[02:57:27.642 --> 02:57:28.542]  Write a story about it.
[02:57:28.582 --> 02:57:29.323]  Send us an article.
[02:57:29.603 --> 02:57:30.163]  We'll post it.
[02:57:30.343 --> 02:57:31.344]  I want to jam in one more.
[02:57:31.364 --> 02:57:34.686]  I'm sorry to Bobby Patriot and Tom, but I've got to talk to Al-Qaeda.
[02:57:35.186 --> 02:57:37.328]  So, you work for the CIA?
[02:57:37.568 --> 02:57:38.769]  Al-Qaeda's calling from Georgia?
[02:57:39.708 --> 02:57:41.489]  No, no CIA here, Alex.
[02:57:41.509 --> 02:57:41.889]  Sorry.
[02:57:42.349 --> 02:57:43.550]  Okay, but you say you're Al-Qaeda.
[02:57:43.650 --> 02:57:45.411]  I claim to be Al-Qaeda, of course.
[02:57:45.751 --> 02:57:45.991]  Yes.
[02:57:46.511 --> 02:57:48.072]  So what's on your mind as you're Al-Qaeda?
[02:57:48.952 --> 02:57:56.736]  I just wanted to say that it's going to have to take something individually for every person that happens to them that will wake them up to this.
[02:57:58.657 --> 02:58:05.620]  I live with both of my parent-in-laws, one suffering from cancer, the other one with other debilitating diseases.
[02:58:07.443 --> 02:58:10.186]  I've been trying to warn them and tell them about the situation.
[02:58:11.408 --> 02:58:12.149]  They didn't believe me.
[02:58:12.229 --> 02:58:13.590]  And then something recently happened.
[02:58:13.630 --> 02:58:15.573]  Their Medicaid, their Medicare was cut off.
[02:58:16.874 --> 02:58:18.296]  You know, they didn't believe me.
[02:58:18.336 --> 02:58:21.099]  But then it finally happened to them and they awoke.
[02:58:23.092 --> 02:58:23.673]  Absolutely.
[02:58:23.693 --> 02:58:25.174]  They've got to have their ox gored.
[02:58:25.634 --> 02:58:30.419]  People better wake up and get involved now against the banker takeover or it's going to get a lot worse.
[02:58:30.459 --> 02:58:32.921]  That's the only way is to stop their agenda.
[02:58:33.221 --> 02:58:37.164]  Key info coming up in the retransmission at InfoWars.com on the audio streams.
[02:58:37.505 --> 02:58:38.386]  God bless you all.
[02:58:38.406 --> 02:58:40.267]  Spread the word about the censorship at PrisonBata.com.
[02:58:40.287 --> 02:58:40.848]  Great job, group.
[02:58:42.269 --> 02:58:43.890]  Thank you for listening to GCA.
[02:58:43.930 --> 02:58:45.412]  Get those articles out, folks.
[02:58:45.432 --> 02:58:46.433]  They can censor us.
[02:58:46.453 --> 02:58:47.654]  They can censor you.
[02:58:48.394 --> 02:58:49.976]  All the other jealous websites get on it.
