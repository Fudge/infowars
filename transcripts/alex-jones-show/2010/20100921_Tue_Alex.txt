[00:00:03.308 --> 00:00:04.688]  We're live.
[00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:06.329]  It is Tuesday, the 21st day of September 2010.
[00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:41.911]  Coming up in this third hour, Judith McGeary, an attorney and a small family farmer, will be joining us.
[00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:49.334]  She's one of the most well-researched and outspoken critics of the legislation they're trying to pass this week.
[00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:52.236]  And I've read the legislation.
[00:00:52.296 --> 00:01:00.439]  It basically could be interpreted to say that you can't make strawberry jam yourself and even give it to friends and family or sell it.
[00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:13.798]  Or you can't go out in the backyard and pick cucumbers and can them and make them as a batch of pickles to sell.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.503]  And this is designed by big mega agribusiness to shut down the small family farm.
[00:01:20.923 --> 00:01:27.008]  They've changed the IRS rules where they basically increase the taxes on what they call hobby farms.
[00:01:27.902 --> 00:01:34.306]  If your farm or ranch isn't making money, then they increase the tax rate and get rid of all the tax exemptions.
[00:01:34.887 --> 00:01:37.509]  That was changed, what, four years ago.
[00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.992]  And most farms and ranches are hobby farms.
[00:01:42.722 --> 00:02:09.073]  You know, daddy and mama work in town at the hardware store, or at the prison, or at the power plant, or at the university, but then they've normally got a small piece of the family farm that, you know, great-granddaddy bought a hundred years before, and over time they've had to sell off most of it, but they may have 20, 30, 40 acres, sometimes just a few acres, and government's coming in with zoning and shutting down those small farms nationwide, and we've covered that.
[00:02:09.853 --> 00:02:19.518]  And they're coming in and saying, if your farm doesn't make money, we're going to increase the taxes on you and not give you your farming tax deductions.
[00:02:23.058 --> 00:02:25.799]  I know that's even going on with my own family.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.964]  And so then, once they've run your farm or ranch out of business, they can then raise the property taxes on your land.
[00:02:35.304 --> 00:02:38.186]  It's no longer having an agriculture exemption at the state level.
[00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:41.608]  Once the feds have made that designation, then you lose your property.
[00:02:42.634 --> 00:02:57.198]  And so they're doing everything they can on record to shut down the family farms and ranches that don't really make money on average, but allow people to continue that lifestyle, continue that culture, continue that connection to the land.
[00:02:57.518 --> 00:03:07.701]  And it does produce a lot of the produce and a lot of the meat, beef, poultry, pork, that ends up on our dinner tables, on our breakfast tables, on our lunch tables.
[00:03:09.817 --> 00:03:16.141]  But getting rid of the tax exemptions at the federal and state level, on top of all the new regulations and harassment.
[00:03:16.381 --> 00:03:19.903]  I mean, take the Real ID for the American people.
[00:03:19.943 --> 00:03:28.688]  That's designed to track everywhere you work and what you do, ultimately forcing everyone into automatic cash transfer, check transfer to the bank.
[00:03:29.088 --> 00:03:34.071]  And then the feds, along what I call the Finnish model, can directly take the money out of your bank account.
[00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:50.728]  When I talked about the Finnish model yesterday I specifically was talking about they were the first country I saw where they began to give the government full control over your bank account and try to force employers to deposit checks by automatic transfer and then the government could just
[00:03:51.977 --> 00:03:55.639]  Uh, deduct new taxes directly out of your bank account.
[00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:03.263]  Similar systems are used worldwide, where you'll notice every year there's new fees on your cable modem, on your cable service.
[00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:07.745]  Uh, new fees on your cell phone service that's just added.
[00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:09.486]  Congress doesn't pass it.
[00:04:09.946 --> 00:04:16.149]  It's just a regulatory system, and that's designed to track and trace and control you and, uh, further, uh, destroy the economy.
[00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:41.193]  Consolidate power, but it's the same thing with the premises ID animal ID You got to pay depending on the regulation you look at ten to fourteen dollars per tag And you've got to have the same tag for cows Chickens goats you name it well a chicken is not worth fourteen dollars on average But then if you look at Tyson chicken who lobbied for it, and they have a world
[00:04:42.566 --> 00:04:50.230]  Chicken near Monopoly, more than half the market globally, they could have one tag per 10,000 chickens.
[00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.790]  But you've got to have a tag per chicken.
[00:04:52.051 --> 00:04:52.971]  Puts you out of business.
[00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:54.632]  Vertically integrates the market.
[00:04:55.412 --> 00:04:56.253]  That's all coming up.
[00:04:56.293 --> 00:04:56.733]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.107 --> 00:05:13.573]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:05:14.573 --> 00:05:18.255]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:31.279]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:39.308]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:49.581]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:05:50.362 --> 00:05:53.627]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:57.411]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:05:57.972 --> 00:06:02.213]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:02.533 --> 00:06:03.133]  Number one.
[00:06:03.453 --> 00:06:06.594]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:06.874 --> 00:06:07.434]  Number two.
[00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:12.276]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:12.616 --> 00:06:13.056]  It's true.
[00:06:13.356 --> 00:06:17.917]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:18.237 --> 00:06:18.777]  Number three.
[00:06:19.057 --> 00:06:22.338]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:22.638 --> 00:06:26.339]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:27.100]  Number 4.
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.702]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:30.102 --> 00:06:33.486]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:33.786 --> 00:06:34.326]  Number 5.
[00:06:34.587 --> 00:06:38.510]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.495]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:43.775 --> 00:06:47.797]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:47.938 --> 00:06:49.498]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:49.739 --> 00:06:51.820]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.182]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:57.703 --> 00:06:58.464]  Listen up, friends.
[00:06:58.504 --> 00:07:00.445]  This is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:04.367]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:07:04.627 --> 00:07:07.269]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:12.511]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:12.872 --> 00:07:14.392]  They're the best company out there.
[00:07:14.632 --> 00:07:18.534]  The longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[00:07:18.814 --> 00:07:20.855]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis.
[00:07:21.155 --> 00:07:24.177]  Not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[00:07:24.497 --> 00:07:26.298]  Try their new evacuation pack.
[00:07:26.458 --> 00:07:28.779]  A two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:31.140]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.401]  What we've got here is
[00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:04.371]  Failure to communicate.
[00:08:04.612 --> 00:08:07.814]  Some men you just can't reach.
[00:08:08.694 --> 00:08:13.878]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[00:08:13.938 --> 00:08:15.239]  Well, he gets it.
[00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:23.785]  I don't like it any more than you do.
[00:08:24.146 --> 00:08:26.427]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:26.788 --> 00:08:28.169]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.569 --> 00:08:33.590]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.074]  It is Tuesday, the 21st day of September 2010.
[00:08:37.754 --> 00:08:48.866]  We do have Judith McGeary, attorney and small family farm owner, one of the leading researchers and experts valiantly fighting the UN written
[00:08:50.114 --> 00:08:51.055]  We're good to go.
[00:09:18.376 --> 00:09:18.696]  I don't
[00:09:41.144 --> 00:10:08.646]  for you and they have undercover police and don't allow it to shut it down like we were down there trying to buy cocaine or something uh... they're now shutting down the cheese makers are shutting down people selling tomatoes on street corners uh... from uh... oklahoma to north carolina and just the last week i've seen articles where they're going the people who have been on their land for decades with small truck farms uh... growing uh... lettuce and tomatoes and things like that squash
[00:10:09.386 --> 00:10:13.850]  And they're shutting them down and just saying, we don't care of your zone to be able to grow this.
[00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.671]  You're not going to do it.
[00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:19.976]  And if you study the Soviet model of total control, that's what's happening.
[00:10:20.657 --> 00:10:31.126]  The city of Austin won't fill the potholes, has passed giant carbon taxes, $2.6 billion in the next three years to be phased in, larger than all other taxes combined.
[00:10:31.727 --> 00:10:33.689]  They're busy with secret undercover police.
[00:10:34.409 --> 00:10:34.849]  I don't know.
[00:10:55.362 --> 00:10:57.825]  Everything you're doing is being watched all over the country.
[00:10:58.325 --> 00:11:11.359]  Cities like Dallas and others are passing giant taxes where you get huge prison sentences if you don't get a permit and then pay huge fees to have a garage sale or to have a
[00:11:14.738 --> 00:11:19.222]  Little stall at, say, the gun show or the bazaar or the flea market.
[00:11:19.723 --> 00:11:31.494]  And really, most people don't make any real money doing this, but as the economy shuts down, people are getting more and more into barter and barely surviving off of selling off what they owned, and that's just not allowed.
[00:11:32.418 --> 00:11:39.665]  We live in a Soviet-type culture, but it's not communist in the way the general public's been taught for the workers, for the people.
[00:11:40.025 --> 00:11:44.410]  Communism is always to consolidate wealth that's then transferred to offshore oligarchs.
[00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.933]  And that's exactly what is happening here.
[00:11:48.414 --> 00:11:54.740]  So they've got legislation to basically legalize millions of illegal aliens tagged on to the Defense Authorization Act.
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:55.280]  I don't
[00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:17.721]  Dream Act, which further legalizes illegal aliens and allows them to bring their families here.
[00:12:19.201 --> 00:12:26.764]  And of course, they're also trying to ram through the two different bills that viciously attack what's left of family farms and ranches.
[00:12:27.144 --> 00:12:28.144]  So we'll be discussing that.
[00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:35.867]  And even if you don't have a family farm or ranch, this affects you in food prices and the economy and small towns and the health of this nation.
[00:12:36.707 --> 00:12:39.409]  It is the stated goal of the White House Science Czar.
[00:12:39.429 --> 00:12:41.551]  It is the stated goal of the United Nations.
[00:12:42.011 --> 00:13:00.487]  We read over this Sunday on air with the Sunday broadcast, 4 to 6 Central, and yesterday I spent a lot of time, over an hour on it, with their quotes from the UN, from the Club of Rome, from the State Department, from the White House Science Czar, from the head climatologist at NASA saying, we want to de-industrialize the West.
[00:13:01.187 --> 00:13:05.570]  We want to bankrupt people where they're so poor, they can't even afford to have children.
[00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:10.092]  And then under the new rules, if you are poor and have children, they're going to try to take them.
[00:13:10.733 --> 00:13:15.516]  See, this is a military, financial Armageddon being carried out.
[00:13:16.336 --> 00:13:24.961]  And any old-timer who went through the Depression can tell you, the banks were happy to give loans ahead of the engineered Depression, because wealth is not destroyed, it is merely transferred.
[00:13:26.142 --> 00:13:29.524]  So the bank loans you money it makes up out of nothing.
[00:13:29.564 --> 00:13:30.605]  It's just on a ballot sheet.
[00:13:32.267 --> 00:13:36.890]  Now on computers today, they want your property, they want your land.
[00:13:37.231 --> 00:13:43.155]  Have you ever done a deed search out in the country, anywhere in this country, you can randomly do it, and see who owns most of the land?
[00:13:43.855 --> 00:13:48.399]  There are thousands of banks that don't even have tellers, that don't even have offices.
[00:13:49.339 --> 00:13:51.781]  They did 50, 60, 70, 80 years ago.
[00:13:52.322 --> 00:14:03.390]  All they are now is private trust of the globalist and most of the land in this country that's supposedly private isn't even owned by local individuals.
[00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.494]  It's owned by banks who stole it from families decades ago.
[00:14:08.362 --> 00:14:09.923]  And they do this over and over again.
[00:14:10.063 --> 00:14:12.284]  This is their system, and it's stated.
[00:14:12.864 --> 00:14:16.125]  And people are going to have to have the courage to admit this to themselves.
[00:14:16.845 --> 00:14:21.067]  And that's all the banker bailout and stimulus packages were.
[00:14:21.447 --> 00:14:24.729]  We haven't gotten new numbers in eight months from the federal government.
[00:14:25.229 --> 00:14:32.432]  Last time we got numbers eight months ago, Bloomberg reported that it was $23.7 trillion.
[00:14:32.472 --> 00:14:33.792]  In fact, pull that up, guys.
[00:14:34.052 --> 00:14:36.053]  Cost of bailout, $23.7 trillion.
[00:14:36.193 --> 00:14:36.793]  It'll come up.
[00:14:37.054 --> 00:14:37.694]  Bloomberg AP.
[00:14:40.188 --> 00:14:46.033]  Now, remember, you've got to pay interest to the private bankers on that, so it's astronomically larger and impossible to pay back.
[00:14:46.313 --> 00:14:47.594]  But they get all the real assets.
[00:14:48.134 --> 00:14:54.279]  But I came up with a number of $28 trillion because Bloomberg went on to report an additional $4 trillion of added bailout.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.541]  But we haven't gotten new numbers.
[00:14:56.701 --> 00:14:57.162]  There it is, $23.7 trillion.
[00:14:57.182 --> 00:14:57.222]  U.S.
[00:14:57.242 --> 00:14:59.544]  Rescue may reach $23.7 trillion.
[00:15:06.047 --> 00:15:10.911]  And there's another article actually with a similar headline where it conclusively says it's over $23.7 trillion.
[00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:16.195]  But $23.7, $28, I mean, it's all devastating.
[00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:18.416]  It's a financial black hole that's impossible to pay back.
[00:15:18.857 --> 00:15:22.760]  But I've got a Houston Chronicle detailed analysis here.
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.743]  Texas reaped $4.6 billion from federal stimulus.
[00:15:27.503 --> 00:15:31.944]  Of the $4.6 billion, 47,704 jobs were created, and that comes out to $96,727 per job, and the average job only paid the person around $30,000.
[00:15:31.984 --> 00:15:35.225]  So, two-thirds of the money, or more, goes to the bureaucracy.
[00:15:54.332 --> 00:16:00.736]  goes to the select corporations that were given the lion's share of the money and and the government agencies that doled it out.
[00:16:01.837 --> 00:16:05.279]  And most of those jobs by the way were in the government sector.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:11.664]  And for every government job, statistically, historically, takes two free market jobs away.
[00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:13.305]  This is even worse though.
[00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:17.087]  If it cost 4.6 billion to get
[00:16:22.074 --> 00:16:25.435]  47,000 jobs and more than half of those were government jobs.
[00:16:26.296 --> 00:16:35.958]  So that'll cost further jobs and those will be jobs that are now put into place and then after the stimulus goes away, which it's already done, then they'll have to raise new local taxes to fund them.
[00:16:35.978 --> 00:16:37.139]  See, that's what the federal government does.
[00:16:37.199 --> 00:16:37.679]  It comes in,
[00:16:38.439 --> 00:16:51.822]  And it brings in police funding, education funding, highway funding, water district funding, and then two years later, or in some cases a year later like this, the money's gone and they come in with lobbyists that say, okay, what you do is you privatize your water.
[00:16:51.882 --> 00:16:54.602]  You paid for these dams over the last 50 plus years.
[00:16:54.902 --> 00:16:57.563]  You paid in taxes to have the infrastructure built.
[00:16:57.883 --> 00:17:01.344]  Now we're going to privatize it, but it isn't really privatizing.
[00:17:01.384 --> 00:17:02.944]  It's like if the government came with guns and
[00:17:03.464 --> 00:17:05.685]  You know, ordered you to hand your house over to a private interest.
[00:17:05.705 --> 00:17:06.645]  That's not privatization.
[00:17:06.905 --> 00:17:10.267]  And then they take over the infrastructure and then jack up prices.
[00:17:11.107 --> 00:17:19.810]  So, they get the huge investment, in some cases it goes back hundreds of years, of the dams, the waterways, the water districts, the power systems, the roads.
[00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:24.072]  They get all that infrastructure for nothing to just administer it.
[00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:26.373]  And then they raise the prices.
[00:17:27.301 --> 00:17:30.563]  The bottom line is, this is a planned, coordinated operation.
[00:17:53.407 --> 00:17:55.268]  This is just Texas, one of 50 states.
[00:17:55.288 --> 00:18:03.275]  American taxpayers have thrown $4.6 billion into emergency projects across Texas over the past 19 months to salvage the Lone Star State economy.
[00:18:03.695 --> 00:18:05.657]  So, oh, it's salvaged our economy.
[00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:10.300]  Now, our economy's the best in the country because we have smaller government than any other state.
[00:18:11.321 --> 00:18:12.362]  And more private property.
[00:18:13.444 --> 00:18:20.527]  I mean, Texas has the best economy in the country, and not that it's great, but it's better than others, because we have smaller government, not because of government.
[00:18:20.727 --> 00:18:22.508]  So you see, you have to love that message there.
[00:18:22.528 --> 00:18:24.909]  You know, oh, the illegal aliens help the economy.
[00:18:24.989 --> 00:18:26.290]  Oh, the feds help the economy.
[00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:31.532]  Yeah, that's like saying a case of gangrene helps your toes when they're falling off.
[00:18:32.665 --> 00:18:43.987]  Amid the nation's worst downturn since the Great Depression, that means each Texas job has cost taxpayers $96,727 according to a Houston Chronicle analysis of federal stimulus funds.
[00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:47.828]  And then it goes through all of the types of jobs and the rest of it.
[00:18:47.848 --> 00:18:53.390]  I have several other reports up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com dealing with that.
[00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:59.551]  I have another big stack of news on the economy where all these private economists and major companies are saying this is a depression.
[00:19:00.251 --> 00:19:01.352]  Our earnings are way down.
[00:19:01.432 --> 00:19:03.234]  Unless you're in the banking sector, those are way up.
[00:19:04.495 --> 00:19:05.596]  Because it's a consolidation.
[00:19:05.676 --> 00:19:06.256]  It's a looting.
[00:19:07.317 --> 00:19:14.644]  But the Fed said yesterday, we read the headline, they said that we left the recession in June of last year.
[00:19:14.664 --> 00:19:17.166]  That everything is wonderful.
[00:19:17.667 --> 00:19:19.628]  So what are you complaining about?
[00:19:20.269 --> 00:19:21.350]  Just more lies.
[00:19:22.748 --> 00:19:34.357]  And as the credibility of the government and the select group of corporations that have grown up around it drops, their answer is accelerate more lies, more corruption, more disinformation.
[00:19:34.717 --> 00:19:36.498]  So we'll be talking about all of that after the break.
[00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:39.901]  And then of course we're going to be discussing Obama's aunt.
[00:19:40.922 --> 00:19:47.387]  She says, quote, if I come here as an illegal immigrant, you have the obligation to make me a citizen.
[00:19:48.047 --> 00:19:49.309]  And that's what these illegals are told.
[00:19:49.969 --> 00:19:56.316]  They're told, you come here, you get on welfare, and you're gonna be made a citizen, and you just vote to take these people's guns.
[00:19:56.637 --> 00:19:58.499]  And they say, absolutely, I'm ready to do it.
[00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:01.442]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:20:01.682 --> 00:20:05.646]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession, or at worst, depression?
[00:20:05.827 --> 00:20:07.869]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:20:08.089 --> 00:20:13.115]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:20:13.255 --> 00:20:15.018]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:20:15.078 --> 00:20:16.419]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.081]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:20:18.101 --> 00:20:21.205]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:26.512]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:20:26.832 --> 00:20:35.957]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[00:20:36.177 --> 00:20:38.478]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:20:38.538 --> 00:20:40.239]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[00:20:44.821 --> 00:20:45.061]  Call 800-686-2237
[00:20:58.226 --> 00:21:03.089]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:21:03.189 --> 00:21:03.950]  What have we got?
[00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.291]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:21:06.631 --> 00:21:07.372]  A republic.
[00:21:07.632 --> 00:21:10.213]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:21:10.273 --> 00:21:12.195]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:21:12.535 --> 00:21:14.456]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:21:14.576 --> 00:21:15.837]  So they think they own our land?
[00:21:16.257 --> 00:21:17.358]  They think they own our water?
[00:21:17.578 --> 00:21:17.978]  Children?
[00:21:18.178 --> 00:21:18.959]  Our education?
[00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:19.919]  Our money?
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.782]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:21:24.142 --> 00:21:27.787]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:21:27.827 --> 00:21:28.808]  You're being warned.
[00:21:29.109 --> 00:21:29.950]  We have the facts.
[00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.251]  We have the Constitution.
[00:21:31.311 --> 00:21:32.193]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:21:32.213 --> 00:21:33.054]  We have common law.
[00:21:33.094 --> 00:21:35.357]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:35.637 --> 00:21:39.402]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:21:39.502 --> 00:21:44.285]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:21:44.446 --> 00:21:45.826]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:21:45.947 --> 00:21:46.787]  Don't tread on me.

[00:22:56.782 --> 00:23:00.343]  As gardeners, we can all relate.
[00:23:00.483 --> 00:23:02.864]  What do you do with all the excess food that you grow?
[00:23:02.944 --> 00:23:10.566]  Freezing or canning may have been the process you've used, but the good folks at Excalibur Dehydrator have a healthy alternative to preserve the fruits of your labor.

[00:23:47.781 --> 00:23:48.281]  Or call 1-800-875-4254.
[00:23:48.301 --> 00:23:48.961]  That's 1-800-875-4254 today!
[00:24:05.509 --> 00:24:23.466]  The federal government here in the United States has been researching a move to basically start taking your paychecks and running it through the federal government first and they will take out the taxes.
[00:24:24.386 --> 00:24:29.249]  And of course, so companies like ADP that process a lot of payroll won't get angry.
[00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:34.273]  The government will use private contractors to do it so they still get their piece of the pie.
[00:24:34.553 --> 00:24:37.555]  But then select corporations will only get the job.
[00:24:37.595 --> 00:24:39.797]  The smaller payroll companies will be out of business.
[00:24:40.357 --> 00:24:42.199]  I have seen that in the literature proposed.
[00:24:42.639 --> 00:24:48.663]  They're officially trying to launch that right now over in the United Kingdom.
[00:24:48.783 --> 00:24:50.865]  And it's the exact same global corporate model.
[00:24:51.545 --> 00:24:59.134]  I remember seven years ago, England started putting tracker chips in the trash cans that would scan, basically, what you were throwing away.
[00:24:59.394 --> 00:25:06.162]  They were hiring citizens to look through the trash at minimum wage, to then tattle on you if you weren't recycling properly.
[00:25:06.642 --> 00:25:08.824]  That's now being implemented in multiple U.S.
[00:25:08.865 --> 00:25:09.225]  cities.
[00:25:09.585 --> 00:25:10.707]  The exact same system.
[00:25:11.857 --> 00:25:19.681]  So everything you see in England, the face scanning cameras a decade ago, the license plate reading cameras 15 years ago, now being implemented here.
[00:25:20.281 --> 00:25:24.143]  The microphones on street corners being called gunshot detectors.
[00:25:24.503 --> 00:25:27.405]  Now they admit, actually we're listening to your conversations.
[00:25:29.096 --> 00:25:31.838]  It's a global government with global models.
[00:25:31.938 --> 00:25:39.964]  They develop the technologies, their private companies are then given government contracts to make money out of surveilling you.
[00:25:40.605 --> 00:25:41.365]  Then they control...
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:56.396]  All of the major tuitions they fund, the grants they fund, the scholarships, converting the economy over, where if you want to go to college or get a job, it's going to be running these systems, or developing these systems.
[00:25:56.976 --> 00:25:58.158]  What do we produce in America?
[00:25:58.238 --> 00:25:58.858]  Jail guards.
[00:25:59.539 --> 00:26:01.161]  Biggest prison population in the world.
[00:26:01.621 --> 00:26:02.843]  Biggest part of our economy now.
[00:26:04.352 --> 00:26:06.513]  Run and administered by major defense contractors.
[00:26:06.954 --> 00:26:08.415]  Who runs the face scanning cameras?
[00:26:08.655 --> 00:26:11.016]  Who runs the biometric thumb scanners to buy and sell?
[00:26:11.577 --> 00:26:12.978]  Who runs the license plate readers?
[00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:14.699]  Who runs the naked body scanners?
[00:26:14.939 --> 00:26:21.163]  Who runs the 500 plus, that was one purchase last year, of mobile x-ray vans that shoot through your house.
[00:26:21.603 --> 00:26:23.965]  Super high power, dwarfing chest x-rays.
[00:26:24.727 --> 00:26:25.767]  Defense contractors.
[00:26:26.468 --> 00:26:27.748]  They are taking over.
[00:26:27.948 --> 00:26:30.009]  They've overthrown countless third world countries.
[00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:31.989]  Why shouldn't they overthrow this country?
[00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:33.150]  They've done it.
[00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:34.410]  Eisenhower warned us.
[00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:38.372]  A technological elite controlling the military-industrial complex.
[00:26:38.652 --> 00:26:39.712]  That's his full quote.
[00:26:40.292 --> 00:26:41.973]  Not just the military-industrial complex.
[00:26:43.273 --> 00:26:44.354]  He talked about who controlled it.
[00:26:45.434 --> 00:26:48.955]  And already the biggest Army, Navy, Marine Corps recruiting centers.
[00:26:49.835 --> 00:26:51.196]  It's not the case for the Air Force.
[00:26:52.199 --> 00:26:53.800]  are in Manila, Philippines.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.240]  Mexico City, Mexico.
[00:26:56.261 --> 00:26:57.241]  They're in Eastern Europe.
[00:26:57.781 --> 00:27:00.842]  And you go to a military base now, and they even put them in units together.
[00:27:00.902 --> 00:27:01.683]  It's just foreigners.
[00:27:02.943 --> 00:27:05.284]  And they're taught to hate this country.
[00:27:05.344 --> 00:27:07.065]  They're not brought here and taught to love it.
[00:27:08.005 --> 00:27:10.226]  And they're taught, you deserve free health care.
[00:27:10.706 --> 00:27:19.550]  You deserve to fly in from Mexico City, or to fly in from China, or to fly in from Eastern Europe, and to instantly have your baby paid for,
[00:27:20.655 --> 00:27:23.738]  And to instantly have full welfare and your whole family legalized.
[00:27:24.599 --> 00:27:31.045]  But, if you're a skilled person from Australia or South Africa or Western Europe, it's almost impossible to come over here.
[00:27:31.385 --> 00:27:40.574]  Even the guy they want to host for Larry King Live, a top British broadcaster, has had to suspend coming here until next year because he can't get a worker visa.
[00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.030]  But, you're Obama's aunt.
[00:27:44.091 --> 00:27:45.611]  His whole family is over here.
[00:27:45.631 --> 00:27:46.631]  They're all illegal aliens.
[00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:47.892]  They've been here for decades.
[00:27:48.372 --> 00:27:49.352]  They get free welfare.
[00:27:49.392 --> 00:27:50.072]  They don't work.
[00:27:50.632 --> 00:27:53.413]  And when she gets asked about it, she says, you owe it to me.
[00:27:54.193 --> 00:27:55.033]  You owe it to me.
[00:27:55.534 --> 00:28:07.577]  This is the foreign army of weak, bedwetting parasites who are the voting army who are going to take your farm, your ranch, your guns, your kids, everything.
[00:28:08.393 --> 00:28:10.034]  And the SWAT teams are a bunch of foreigners.
[00:28:10.594 --> 00:28:12.775]  These Federal Army SWAT teams they're creating.
[00:28:13.015 --> 00:28:13.775]  This is hell!
[00:28:14.236 --> 00:28:17.277]  Just as the British 200 plus years ago landed German troops here.
[00:28:17.677 --> 00:28:23.780]  They now land a motley crew of foreigners and slap American flags on their arms, but teach them to hate this country.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.042]  Now, we may not even be able to repair things even if you'd wake up and take action.
[00:28:28.342 --> 00:28:30.643]  But if you sit there and live in denial, it's over.
[00:28:30.883 --> 00:28:32.004]  Now, here is his hand.
[00:28:33.271 --> 00:28:39.094]  The illegal alien, on welfare, saying you owe me everything.
[00:28:39.655 --> 00:28:40.195]  Scum.
[00:28:40.475 --> 00:28:41.095]  Here it is.
[00:28:41.616 --> 00:28:45.638]  Zatouni Anyango lives in South Boston in public housing.
[00:28:46.178 --> 00:28:47.099]  She's unemployed.
[00:28:47.479 --> 00:28:48.960]  She collects disability.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.362]  And insisting her nephew never pulled any strings for her.
[00:28:53.042 --> 00:28:57.005]  Recently, she sat down for an exclusive interview with Jonathan Elias.
[00:28:57.485 --> 00:28:59.486]  And Jonathan, she's not making any apologies.
[00:28:59.686 --> 00:29:00.727]  Jack, she makes none.
[00:29:00.767 --> 00:29:01.968]  In fact, she's very fiery.
[00:29:02.468 --> 00:29:04.949]  The mention of her name makes many in Boston angry.
[00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:08.391]  Angry because she is living off of a system that she's never paid into.
[00:29:09.072 --> 00:29:14.935]  Angry because she is from a family that is now very wealthy, yet she remains a burden to Massachusetts taxpayers.
[00:29:16.736 --> 00:29:17.417]  If I come,
[00:29:19.011 --> 00:29:24.215]  As an immigrant, you have the obligation to make me a citizen.
[00:29:24.656 --> 00:29:30.160]  This is President Obama's aunt, a woman many say is the poster child of our broken immigration system.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.721]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:29:32.242 --> 00:29:36.125]  And they always call it broken, and their solution is, let billions in!
[00:29:37.586 --> 00:29:41.289]  And then Hollywood will produce movies where the foreigners hack us up with machetings.
[00:29:41.549 --> 00:29:44.111]  Of course then, who's gonna pay for all your welfare?
[00:29:44.652 --> 00:29:45.612]  That's the big dirty secret.
[00:29:45.632 --> 00:29:47.174]  Almost all these immigrants are on welfare.
[00:29:48.817 --> 00:29:51.858]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.758 --> 00:29:55.579]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:04.002]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:30:04.022 --> 00:30:10.024]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:30:10.404 --> 00:30:17.066]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:30:19.127 --> 00:30:21.410]  They sow pride in every stitch.
[00:30:23.172 --> 00:30:25.295]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:39.149]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:30:39.409 --> 00:30:40.909]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:30:41.189 --> 00:30:43.750]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[00:32:50.954 --> 00:32:51.394]  Thank you!
[00:33:01.032 --> 00:33:02.933]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:33:03.513 --> 00:33:03.894]  A lie!
[00:33:04.334 --> 00:33:06.015]  No man is obsolete!
[00:33:06.335 --> 00:33:08.156]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:33:08.216 --> 00:33:11.098]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[00:33:11.438 --> 00:33:16.561]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[00:33:16.901 --> 00:33:18.522]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[00:33:18.582 --> 00:33:19.702]  A crawling insect!
[00:33:20.343 --> 00:33:24.145]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[00:33:24.745 --> 00:33:25.986]  I am a human being.
[00:33:26.406 --> 00:33:33.408]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind.
[00:33:33.989 --> 00:33:34.749]  I don't care.
[00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:36.169]  I tell you, I don't care.
[00:33:36.189 --> 00:33:37.550]  I'm a human being.
[00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:38.250]  I exist.
[00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:44.973]  And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave.
[00:33:45.453 --> 00:33:48.174]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:33:48.594 --> 00:33:53.276]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have
[00:34:03.338 --> 00:34:06.820]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:34:07.421 --> 00:34:09.262]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:10.623 --> 00:34:24.654]  I don't know where to start on this whole Obama situation and the fact that at least five of his Kenyan family are here living on welfare for free.
[00:34:26.087 --> 00:34:40.619]  You know, really the bigger issue is, what type of person who's conservatively made ten million dollars in the last decade, off book sales and the rest of it, and stock, would not help his family?
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:48.266]  I personally have some family who've been on hard times off and on, and I've given them quite a bit of money.
[00:34:49.747 --> 00:34:52.209]  And it's because charity starts at home.
[00:34:55.226 --> 00:35:02.772]  And I also have given money to handicapped children charities and other things that I know actually help people.
[00:35:04.633 --> 00:35:10.898]  You know, a lot of charity is making sure you're not giving to a bad group because so many of them are corrupt and bad, but you can't let that stop you.
[00:35:11.439 --> 00:35:12.559]  But can you imagine?
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.383]  Michelle Obama's very wealthy, Obama is very wealthy, Barry Sitaro.
[00:35:17.923 --> 00:35:20.626]  And he doesn't meet with, he doesn't see his family.
[00:35:21.866 --> 00:35:23.528]  He met with them when he was younger in Kenya.
[00:35:25.106 --> 00:35:33.349]  And the media basically has ignored this, and then his aunt gets up on television and says, you know, she came here illegally, that's on record.
[00:35:33.609 --> 00:35:36.951]  She's on a whole bunch of welfare, the highest level of welfare you could be on.
[00:35:36.971 --> 00:35:37.831]  She's on disability.
[00:35:38.491 --> 00:35:39.852]  She's living in government housing.
[00:35:40.612 --> 00:35:43.453]  She's got money to be wearing nice clothes and having her hair all done up.
[00:35:44.234 --> 00:35:48.836]  And she's sitting up there saying, you owe it to me, and she says it with disgust.
[00:35:49.416 --> 00:35:51.877]  This is the big banker's army.
[00:35:52.856 --> 00:35:54.637]  Our military is full of foreigners.
[00:35:55.938 --> 00:35:56.679]  I mean, directly.
[00:35:56.699 --> 00:35:58.920]  Illegal aliens, they're going to make them legal, put them in.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.201]  They've already been doing it.
[00:36:00.621 --> 00:36:01.782]  Now they're going to accelerate it.
[00:36:02.022 --> 00:36:02.682]  Free tuition.
[00:36:02.702 --> 00:36:11.328]  Remember all the cases in Texas and Utah that have come out in the last few years, where in-state citizens pay more for college than illegal aliens.
[00:36:11.648 --> 00:36:14.350]  And then out-of-state citizens pay even more.
[00:36:16.974 --> 00:36:18.935]  Because you are an enemy.
[00:36:19.335 --> 00:36:20.816]  You are hated.
[00:36:21.236 --> 00:36:22.557]  You are to be bankrupted.
[00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:28.019]  Now, once we're completely bankrupt and the Depression's run its course, the illegals aren't going to get all these freebies anymore.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:35.683]  After they voted to take the guns and formed the great military of the, you know, the foreign mercenary military.
[00:36:36.663 --> 00:36:39.764]  Our main military is now a foreign army, predominantly.
[00:36:40.805 --> 00:36:44.927]  And they've got the hundreds of thousands, over half a million private mercs,
[00:36:48.032 --> 00:36:49.614]  We've seen this before in history.
[00:36:50.855 --> 00:36:53.037]  But think about the brazen arrogance.
[00:36:53.137 --> 00:36:55.820]  And you know why they're coming out openly and admitting all this?
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:01.105]  Because over 51% of the American people are on welfare, or they're on corporate welfare.
[00:37:01.265 --> 00:37:03.347]  They're getting some type of government contract or handout.
[00:37:04.649 --> 00:37:08.032]  It is hard to find people who aren't on the government dole.
[00:37:08.452 --> 00:37:11.896]  And when you do, their taxes are going up, and so they're laying people off.
[00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:23.673]  You know, I'm looking for revenue streams with PrisonPlanet.tv and video and book sales, not to just expand as we need to do in the face of this tyranny, but to continue!
[00:37:27.156 --> 00:37:30.619]  To be able to even continue at the level we're at.
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.943]  I have to look at the numbers, and I have to look at who's productive, and who's the most productive.
[00:37:38.146 --> 00:37:40.669]  But not if you've got a government job, or not if you're on welfare.
[00:37:41.749 --> 00:37:43.410]  But I want to tell Republicans something.
[00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:48.433]  I hear all self-righteously on talk radio this morning talking about Obama's aunt saying, you owe me the money.
[00:37:49.073 --> 00:37:49.894]  You owe it to me!
[00:37:49.994 --> 00:37:51.495]  I'm gonna come here and you're gonna bankroll me.
[00:37:55.157 --> 00:38:07.199]  $2 trillion plus, $1.1 trillion on budget, $800 plus billion supplemental, $300 to $400 to $500 some years in other black op funding, so actually it's well over $2 trillion.
[00:38:07.219 --> 00:38:12.860]  $1.1 trillion, $800 billion is $1.9 trillion, then $300 to $400 on top of that, so we're talking $2.2, $2.3 depending on the year, trillion.
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:13.901]  There's your welfare.
[00:38:23.502 --> 00:38:30.507]  But you notice now it's free college and all this for anybody that will join the military if you're an illegal alien.
[00:38:32.388 --> 00:38:34.550]  And if you read the DREAM Act, it's even more expansive than that.
[00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:41.875]  And then you've got all these hard-working immigrants from Latin America, Asia, Europe, who can't come here.
[00:38:42.095 --> 00:38:46.138]  You try to go through the channels, it's almost impossible.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.622]  And people say, well, the system will just collapse.
[00:38:52.742 --> 00:38:56.704]  They estimate within just a few years it'll be 60% or more on government dole.
[00:38:56.924 --> 00:39:00.966]  You've already got 43 million plus people on food stamps, and it's growing.
[00:39:01.166 --> 00:39:02.686]  That's a high-tech version.
[00:39:02.706 --> 00:39:06.128]  You know, they don't have paper stamps anymore, it's a swipe card, looks like a credit card.
[00:39:06.668 --> 00:39:11.210]  And I'll be standing there at the grocery store line watching people, and a large percentage of them are swiping the card.
[00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:12.251]  I'm looking at their card.
[00:39:13.271 --> 00:39:15.392]  You think, well, things will just collapse, it's the left end someday.
[00:39:15.452 --> 00:39:15.652]  No.
[00:39:16.192 --> 00:39:19.734]  Once it fully starts collapsing, the government will use that crisis to get even more power.
[00:39:24.428 --> 00:39:31.272]  Now let's play his aunt with what she had to say with Boston Television, WBZ.
[00:39:31.593 --> 00:39:32.633]  Television, here it is.
[00:39:33.234 --> 00:39:35.915]  Yet she remains a burden to Massachusetts taxpayers.
[00:39:40.054 --> 00:39:45.240]  As an immigrant, you have the obligation to make me a citizen.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:51.387]  This is President Obama's aunt, a woman many say is the poster child of our broken immigration system.
[00:39:51.928 --> 00:39:53.509]  We only found out about her back in 2008.
[00:39:58.442 --> 00:40:00.523]  It was the weekend before the November election.
[00:40:00.983 --> 00:40:11.728]  Democratic presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, started getting questions about his aunt, Zeytunyi Onyeng'o of Kenya, an illegal immigrant living in public housing in Boston.
[00:40:12.148 --> 00:40:16.210]  You're here illegally, and he's running for the President of the United States, that's what I'm saying is.
[00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:19.291]  Listen, Obama did not know my whereabouts.
[00:40:19.652 --> 00:40:24.314]  For the first time, Zeytunyi is setting the record straight, sitting down with me for this interview.
[00:40:25.114 --> 00:40:32.836]  She had come to the United States in 2000, and says she had ever... Alright, and then some of her family, some of her family's been here for more than 20 years.
[00:40:32.876 --> 00:40:41.839]  The point is, that she's been here for a decade, she came here illegally, and she says, you owe it to me.
[00:40:43.459 --> 00:40:47.700]  And what do you want to bet that woman would vote to take your guns, take your farm, take your ranch?
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:48.941]  Because you owe it to her.
[00:40:48.961 --> 00:40:53.062]  It's like in Zimbabwe, they're taking people's farms and killing them.
[00:40:54.409 --> 00:40:55.550]  It's owed to the people.
[00:40:56.411 --> 00:40:57.272]  It's owed to her.
[00:40:58.974 --> 00:41:00.155]  It's owed to her.
[00:41:02.818 --> 00:41:03.979]  And that's the attitude.
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:10.326]  And what do you think is going to happen as the depression gets worse and worse over the next decade, this slow slide into total degradation?
[00:41:11.387 --> 00:41:14.771]  They're going to form the giant hordes of
[00:41:16.488 --> 00:41:20.610]  Inner-city people on welfare, people in the Appalachias, you name it.
[00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:24.271]  Everybody dependent on the system into a voting army.
[00:41:24.291 --> 00:41:25.852]  They already are, but even more so.
[00:41:26.612 --> 00:41:31.194]  And they're going to be hyped up and told, you do this for the government, you'll get your free handouts.
[00:41:31.294 --> 00:41:32.334]  That's democracy.
[00:41:32.674 --> 00:41:37.336]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[00:41:38.156 --> 00:41:42.558]  And if you had two wolves and a sheep and a democracy, and they had a vote, what do you think the wolves are going to vote for?
[00:41:43.476 --> 00:41:44.937]  All right, let's have a vote on what's for dinner.
[00:41:45.598 --> 00:41:46.939]  Hmm, there's two wolves and one sheep.
[00:41:47.979 --> 00:41:48.480]  What's for dinner?
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:49.380]  The sheep.
[00:41:49.861 --> 00:41:51.462]  But see, the American people aren't supposed to be sheep.
[00:41:51.502 --> 00:41:53.143]  We're armed with the First Amendment.
[00:41:53.603 --> 00:41:56.866]  We're armed with the Second Amendment to defend ourselves against common criminals and government criminals.
[00:41:58.047 --> 00:42:02.770]  We are armed with the Fourth Amendment to protect our papers and private effects in our homes.
[00:42:03.971 --> 00:42:05.092]  All of that's out the window.
[00:42:05.272 --> 00:42:06.313]  The shields are down.
[00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:11.092]  I want to open the phones up for listeners on this subject.
[00:42:11.152 --> 00:42:18.338]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231 on all the issues I've been discussing.
[00:42:18.358 --> 00:42:20.559]  And again, it's first-time callers today.
[00:42:20.659 --> 00:42:22.521]  I love giving first-time callers.
[00:42:22.561 --> 00:42:26.304]  In fact, if you were first-time callers yesterday when we ended the show, we had a lot of people on hold.
[00:42:26.864 --> 00:42:27.404]  Call back in.
[00:42:27.424 --> 00:42:28.325]  We'll go to the head of the line.
[00:42:28.685 --> 00:42:30.307]  First-time callers only.
[00:42:31.363 --> 00:42:35.965]  Then we'll have open phones for farmers and ranchers being harassed by government and all the different permutations.
[00:42:35.985 --> 00:42:42.528]  We'll analyze the attack profile of the enemy, the full spectrum attack, not just the new draconian legislation in the last hour.
[00:42:42.548 --> 00:42:49.031]  That'll be open phones for everyone who wants to comment on farming and ranching and what's happening there and how we're basically going into total serfdom.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:57.604]  And serfdom was where the government, whether it was Japan or England, same system, would only let you till so much land, a certain percentage had to be given to the government.
[00:42:57.984 --> 00:42:59.004]  This is what we're going into.
[00:42:59.424 --> 00:43:00.785]  But they don't even want you producing.
[00:43:01.205 --> 00:43:11.630]  They want big, mega agribusiness producing GMO crops that are deadly, on record, and not letting you, the feds are now announcing, even have it labeled that it's non-GMO.
[00:43:12.811 --> 00:43:15.172]  GMO pig that's got insect genes?
[00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:15.912]  You're not allowed to know.
[00:43:16.052 --> 00:43:16.893]  Already on store shelves.
[00:43:18.257 --> 00:43:25.502]  GMO salmon, insect genes, twice as big as regular salmon, a chimera clone, not allowed to know.
[00:43:29.292 --> 00:43:34.676]  They're now even moving to not make the food manufacturers tell you if there's corn syrup in it.
[00:43:35.076 --> 00:43:39.699]  Oh, when you weren't paying attention to what corn syrup and aspartame was doing to you, then they could put it on the label.
[00:43:39.979 --> 00:43:43.481]  Now you know, now you've put on the They Live sunglasses.
[00:43:43.521 --> 00:43:44.222]  You ever seen that movie?
[00:43:44.402 --> 00:43:46.143]  You put the sunglasses on, you can see the real world.
[00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:53.288]  Now that more and more of us can see, and people are only seeing, most people that wake up can now only realize they have eyes.
[00:43:53.848 --> 00:43:55.349]  That they can research, that there's an agenda.
[00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.111]  They can only see a few feet in front of them.
[00:43:57.371 --> 00:43:58.912]  But as you research, suddenly you can see
[00:44:00.013 --> 00:44:00.273]  100 feet.
[00:44:00.953 --> 00:44:02.414]  Then you can see a half mile.
[00:44:02.654 --> 00:44:03.555]  Then you can see a mile.
[00:44:03.695 --> 00:44:04.776]  Then you can see a hundred miles.
[00:44:04.956 --> 00:44:05.937]  Then a thousand miles.
[00:44:06.297 --> 00:44:09.279]  Then you can see things over the horizon before it even happens.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.941]  The human mind's incredible.
[00:44:12.181 --> 00:44:13.082]  And the globalists know that.
[00:44:13.222 --> 00:44:15.303]  That's why they're drugging the food, they're drugging the water.
[00:44:15.684 --> 00:44:16.664]  Look at this news right here.
[00:44:16.724 --> 00:44:17.625]  Well, let me give you the number.
[00:44:17.805 --> 00:44:18.065]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:44:18.085 --> 00:44:18.145]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:44:18.165 --> 00:44:19.707]  Frankenfood coming soon to a store near you.
[00:44:29.229 --> 00:44:34.993]  Before it was just, that's Fox News, there were only eight major GMO crops that are the fillers in most processed foods.
[00:44:35.353 --> 00:44:43.379]  And in every study, just by accident of course, the foods have added attributes that cause reduced fertility and organ failure.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:44.700]  Every study!
[00:44:46.361 --> 00:44:49.103]  Just pull up GMO corn linked to organ failure.
[00:44:50.324 --> 00:44:52.205]  GMO soybean linked to organ failure.
[00:44:52.806 --> 00:44:54.307]  And then get ready to do some reading.
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:57.181]  But it's easier just to say, I'm making this up.
[00:44:57.261 --> 00:44:58.261]  Isn't it just easier?
[00:44:58.281 --> 00:45:04.964]  You know, they'll put a tax on salt, or a tax on liquor, or a tax on cigarettes, or a tax on beef.
[00:45:05.485 --> 00:45:06.465]  Europe's already starting that.
[00:45:07.205 --> 00:45:08.206]  Saying it's bad for you.
[00:45:08.406 --> 00:45:14.209]  But then things we know are bad for you, they're pushing on you and don't want you to know via the labeling.
[00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:18.431]  Frankenfood, coming soon to a store near you.
[00:45:18.831 --> 00:45:22.713]  Watch for the new section, frozen foods and organic in your supermarket, genetically engineered.
[00:45:23.635 --> 00:45:26.919]  That is, if the government approves the so-called frankenfoods for sale.
[00:45:28.301 --> 00:45:29.702]  And you're not going to be allowed to know.
[00:45:29.723 --> 00:45:32.025]  In fact, this article doesn't have it in the headline.
[00:45:32.045 --> 00:45:37.172]  When you pull up, government is trying to block labeling for GMO.
[00:45:37.212 --> 00:45:39.975]  I'm going to pull up, I believe it was AP.
[00:45:42.008 --> 00:45:48.913]  The Food and Drug Administration Monday began a two-day look at the issue, focusing on genetically modified salmon, which would be the first such food approved for human consumption.
[00:45:48.933 --> 00:45:49.533]  That's not true.
[00:45:50.454 --> 00:45:56.278]  Clone and cross-species pigs and beef, both cows and pig, are on shelves.
[00:45:56.819 --> 00:46:01.742]  The agency has already said the salmon, which grows twice as fast as conventional ones, are safe to eat.
[00:46:03.243 --> 00:46:05.404]  Salmon Act is a genetic gatekeeper in this case.
[00:46:05.925 --> 00:46:08.827]  Approve them and open the door to a variety of other genetically engineered animals.
[00:46:08.847 --> 00:46:14.770]  Including environmentally friendly pig that's being developed in Canada and cattle that are resistant to bad cow disease.
[00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:15.991]  So you can feed them rotten meat.
[00:46:16.271 --> 00:46:18.393]  Not even supposed to feed cows meat, but they feed it to them.
[00:46:18.593 --> 00:46:20.354]  Then they grow prion crystals and you eat it.
[00:46:21.667 --> 00:46:24.148]  And we're now getting people 20, 25, 30 getting Alzheimer's.
[00:46:24.168 --> 00:46:26.089]  It's really mad cow, mad human.
[00:46:26.529 --> 00:46:27.889]  And you're not allowed to know that.
[00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:35.692]  But really, Fox News is here saying that these salmon are safe.
[00:46:35.872 --> 00:46:37.173]  They have insect genes in them.
[00:46:37.193 --> 00:46:39.734]  You know, that's funny.
[00:46:41.434 --> 00:46:50.798]  I saw the university studies, it was in the Oregonian, where they did controlled tests and found within 40 generations these fish will extinct natural salmon.
[00:46:53.319 --> 00:47:00.521]  That's 40 years in the open sea, because they're twice as big, twice as fast, and are mean, and attack the other salmon.
[00:47:03.522 --> 00:47:06.062]  But, hey, let's release these in the ocean.
[00:47:06.582 --> 00:47:07.503]  Great idea.
[00:47:09.223 --> 00:47:09.983]  Great idea.
[00:47:10.423 --> 00:47:12.484]  Let's release these in the ocean.
[00:47:15.282 --> 00:47:15.842]  Here's another one.
[00:47:15.902 --> 00:47:19.385]  Government's implement planned tax on sweets, ice cream, soft drinks.
[00:47:19.745 --> 00:47:22.427]  Saying, oh, we're going to tax you having some ice cream.
[00:47:22.627 --> 00:47:23.908]  What you have to eat too much of, it's bad.
[00:47:24.228 --> 00:47:28.331]  And we're going to track what you eat to be able to decide how much bad stuff you're allowed to eat.
[00:47:28.351 --> 00:47:31.073]  And after a certain quota, then we start taxing it.
[00:47:31.513 --> 00:47:33.515]  Which again is a tracking system of what you're eating.
[00:47:34.815 --> 00:47:36.336]  And the school kids have been well trained at this.
[00:47:36.857 --> 00:47:39.859]  All over Europe and the United States, most major school districts, thumb scan.
[00:47:40.259 --> 00:47:42.601]  Even if you're paying cash to get food and it's put in a database.
[00:47:43.951 --> 00:47:47.453]  Oh, and then if it's found your kid doesn't have enough money, CPS is called.
[00:47:49.454 --> 00:47:52.255]  Manganese in the water tied to kid's low IQ.
[00:47:52.315 --> 00:48:02.721]  This is out of the CBC, the major Canadian national television, government television, public television, and funny, why don't they run the reports that
[00:48:04.141 --> 00:48:15.946]  Fluoridated water at one part per million, depending on the study, causes between a 10, in the lowest number in the studies, and 20-point IQ reduction, especially if children drink it.
[00:48:16.166 --> 00:48:21.689]  It has a bigger effect in 0 to 5-year-olds during neurological wiring and main development.
[00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:32.774]  Oh, but they won't... I mean, you could pull up all those studies that sodium fluoride reduces your IQ massively and is a cumulative bioaccumulating poison.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:38.045]  And the EPA's own scientists have come out and called for it to be pulled, but who cares what they say.
[00:48:38.746 --> 00:48:39.407]  Manganese, though.
[00:48:39.427 --> 00:48:40.589]  They'll tell you about manganese.
[00:48:42.031 --> 00:48:49.061]  An IQ comparison shows the Canadian regulations on manganese in drinking water should be updated to protect children, Quebec researchers say.
[00:48:50.259 --> 00:48:56.524]  An IQ comparison shows that Canadian regulations on manganese in drinking water should be updated to protect children, Quebec researchers say.
[00:48:56.544 --> 00:49:05.431]  The average IQ of children whose tap water is in the upper 20% of manganese concentration was 6 points below children whose water contained little or no manganese, research found.
[00:49:06.392 --> 00:49:08.554]  And it goes on, other studies show the same thing.
[00:49:11.856 --> 00:49:18.682]  The IQ in every major fluoridated nation is conservatively 10 points under now.
[00:49:19.724 --> 00:49:24.126]  And that mirrors the other studies about, with rodents and humans, that it reduces IQ.
[00:49:25.207 --> 00:49:33.832]  I mean, they have many famous studies where a major town next to a city that's fluoridated isn't fluoridated, and their IQ is 10 point higher.
[00:49:34.952 --> 00:49:37.814]  I mean, you couldn't be doing something more brutal.
[00:49:37.994 --> 00:49:42.997]  And then they add all the fluoride pills they give the kids in school and the fluoride gel treatments.
[00:49:43.962 --> 00:49:49.067]  I mean, you might as well... I mean, if you want that effect, take your kid out back and beat him in the head with a sledgehammer.
[00:49:49.087 --> 00:49:53.070]  I mean, you'll get the same IQ reduction type... I'm not saying do that, I'm being sarcastic.
[00:49:55.132 --> 00:49:56.293]  But here's the big secret.
[00:49:57.537 --> 00:50:16.796]  Did you know that in Europe and the United States and Canada, that when you hear the word fluoride, they are allowed to put over 300 chemicals and poisons in the water that are byproducts of aluminum production, fertilizer production, and cracking of oil, in the process of refining oil.
[00:50:17.116 --> 00:50:21.981]  And they take this sludge, and that's what they pump in your water, and guess what's in there?
[00:50:23.663 --> 00:50:27.585]  Not just lead, mercury, arsenic, sodium fluoride, manganese.
[00:50:28.166 --> 00:50:31.808]  So, the rest of the story is, they're adding manganese.
[00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:37.151]  But we should trust and love the government.
[00:50:37.171 --> 00:50:39.932]  Because they're doing all this because they care so much about us.
[00:50:41.613 --> 00:50:43.494]  And they call it now cognitive enhancement.
[00:50:44.014 --> 00:50:46.896]  They say mercury actually makes children behave better and be smarter.
[00:50:47.276 --> 00:50:51.879]  Because to them, cognitive enhancement is being brain damaged and servile.
[00:50:54.155 --> 00:50:55.563]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:55.603 --> 00:50:57.232]  Stay with us on the other side of this quick break.
[00:50:58.638 --> 00:50:59.778]  This may surprise you.
[00:50:59.998 --> 00:51:04.200]  Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions among both adults and children.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.120]  You or someone you know may have it.
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:09.861]  Managing type 2 diabetes in conventional ways is a never-ending task.
[00:51:10.041 --> 00:51:12.362]  But this good news may also surprise you.
[00:51:12.622 --> 00:51:17.924]  A recent UCLA study proved that type 2 diabetes can be reversed in only 21 days.
[00:51:18.164 --> 00:51:25.606]  Puriam Health Products recently developed a product that mimics the healthy diet used in that UCLA study called Scoop of Greens, an easy
[00:51:25.726 --> 00:51:30.810]  Great tasting, affordable way to give your body the nutritional tools to help it overcome type 2 diabetes.
[00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:35.734]  Scoop of Greens has been awarded the Diabetes Resource Center Seal of Approval so you know it's safe.

[00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:02.991]  We are part of a new world order.
[00:52:03.011 --> 00:52:05.931]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[00:52:06.331 --> 00:52:11.073]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:11.433 --> 00:52:15.614]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:15.934 --> 00:52:18.278]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:18.398 --> 00:52:20.841]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:21.182 --> 00:52:23.745]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:24.086 --> 00:52:31.697]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:32.017 --> 00:52:37.280]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.682]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:39.722 --> 00:52:43.724]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:43.944 --> 00:52:44.885]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:45.025 --> 00:52:46.326]  You're everyone else.

[00:52:57.935 --> 00:53:01.096]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:53:01.476 --> 00:53:03.296]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:53:03.757 --> 00:53:04.157]  Don't!
[00:53:04.617 --> 00:53:07.658]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:53:08.058 --> 00:53:15.179]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'

[00:53:31.733 --> 00:53:32.734]  Herb K was right.
[00:53:32.934 --> 00:53:35.958]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:53:36.118 --> 00:53:36.999]  What do you have to lose?
[00:53:37.379 --> 00:53:38.339]  Stop the calls now.
[00:53:38.599 --> 00:53:40.320]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[00:53:40.561 --> 00:53:41.141]  Get Herb K.'
[00:53:41.081 --> 00:53:43.842]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[00:53:43.862 --> 00:53:44.183]  Call 800-405-7850.
[00:53:44.203 --> 00:53:44.623]  That's 800-405-7850.
[00:53:44.643 --> 00:53:44.683]  800-405-7850.
[00:54:11.825 --> 00:54:31.050]  We're going to start the next hour here in just a few minutes, and we're going to go directly to Nick, Denny, Gail, Corrine, and others that are patiently holding.
[00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:34.071]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:54:34.111 --> 00:54:35.491]  But I wanted to spend a few minutes
[00:54:41.584 --> 00:54:49.931]  Just boiling down a moment of clarity I had this morning, and that I hope you'll think about and, you know, add your own thoughts to when we take your calls.
[00:54:51.372 --> 00:54:53.854]  It's very simple, and we talk a lot about this.
[00:54:58.918 --> 00:55:02.862]  When a society has been wealthy and rich, because we had liberty,
[00:55:03.803 --> 00:55:17.633]  We go into that cycle that we've talked about for 15 years of becoming lackadaisical, then corruption can take root, people stand down, and you get a collapse of society.
[00:55:18.774 --> 00:55:31.083]  You go from liberty to plenty, and then you become decadent, and then corruption sets in, and then tyranny comes, and then society collapses, and people fight for their freedoms again, they appreciate the good things in life, they appreciate freedom again, and
[00:55:33.616 --> 00:55:34.056]  A lot
[00:55:55.629 --> 00:55:57.030]  ...can grow our numbers.
[00:55:57.291 --> 00:56:01.494]  When society does collapse, we then have a better chance of fixing things.
[00:56:01.915 --> 00:56:02.776]  It's going to collapse.
[00:56:02.816 --> 00:56:03.957]  There's no stopping that now.
[00:56:04.737 --> 00:56:05.818]  I just want to be honest with you.
[00:56:06.319 --> 00:56:07.260]  There's no way to stop it.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:08.401]  We have collapsed.
[00:56:08.821 --> 00:56:10.262]  We are dead as a society.
[00:56:10.663 --> 00:56:11.924]  A lot of you just don't know it yet.
[00:56:12.364 --> 00:56:19.110]  Just like we're in a depression, according to every measurement, but the government tells you that we're in a great economy and there's no recession for 15 months.
[00:56:19.571 --> 00:56:20.532]  That it ended in June of 2009.
[00:56:23.544 --> 00:56:31.407]  That's because a lot of the public's still delusional, and the government's talking to that group, 35% or so, that still believe anything.
[00:56:31.427 --> 00:56:37.410]  I mean, this is like Eskimos that you can sell ice cubes to.
[00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:39.411]  They will buy anything.
[00:56:39.531 --> 00:56:44.213]  Of course, the Eskimo really wouldn't buy ice cubes, but that's how ignorant this is.
[00:56:45.874 --> 00:56:52.717]  And the worst facet to all of this, the really bad thing, is that
[00:56:53.834 --> 00:56:56.175]  There's another big side effect to decadence.
[00:56:56.635 --> 00:57:02.557]  It doesn't just bring you oppressive tyranny, because people don't care and are laying around and don't have respect for themselves and aren't involved.
[00:57:03.377 --> 00:57:09.639]  Because they don't even have a gauge, societally, historically, economically, spiritually, to oppose evil.
[00:57:10.059 --> 00:57:10.820]  They don't have a rudder.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:14.461]  But the really dangerous side effect is this.
[00:57:17.719 --> 00:57:32.406]  Hyper-decadence, and you see this with ruling elites throughout history, they become so corrupt, they become so jaded, that they get into more and more forms of decadence and sickness.
[00:57:33.027 --> 00:57:43.552]  Whether it's gladiatorial games, or ritualistic murder, or human sacrifice, or wars for fun, or out-of-control corruption, all of that comes as a package.
[00:57:44.557 --> 00:57:50.628]  But now the globalists have scientifically decided, and they've said this, to make the public like them.
[00:57:50.648 --> 00:57:55.316]  And the general population always mirrors the ruling class to some extent.
[00:57:55.917 --> 00:57:56.458]  But now...
[00:57:57.677 --> 00:58:15.003]  There's a form of synthetic tyranny and synthetic decadence where they want to make people hyper-decadent and passive and drugged so that they get into their own destruction and actually hate themselves and those around them and actually enjoy the death and destruction.
[00:58:16.783 --> 00:58:21.805]  And so after I take a bunch of calls, I'm going to try to flesh this out in a little more detail and quantify it.
[00:58:23.507 --> 00:58:36.318]  But the globalists have grown giant hordes of sadomasochistic control freaks that are going to attempt a mass murder operation that will make Hitler look like a piker.
[00:58:39.942 --> 00:58:41.803]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.465 --> 00:58:45.006]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:48.015 --> 00:58:52.238]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:52.558 --> 00:58:53.159]  Number 1.
[00:58:53.479 --> 00:58:56.621]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:56.902 --> 00:58:57.462]  Number 2.
[00:58:57.762 --> 00:59:02.306]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:02.646 --> 00:59:03.086]  It's true.
[00:59:03.386 --> 00:59:07.950]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.810]  Number 3.
[00:59:09.091 --> 00:59:12.373]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:12.673 --> 00:59:16.376]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:16.576 --> 00:59:17.117]  Number 4.
[00:59:17.377 --> 00:59:19.739]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:20.139 --> 00:59:23.523]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:23.823 --> 00:59:24.343]  Number 5.
[00:59:24.604 --> 00:59:28.527]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:28.747 --> 00:59:33.512]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:33.792 --> 00:59:37.815]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:37.955 --> 00:59:39.536]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:39.756 --> 00:59:41.838]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:42.018 --> 00:59:44.600]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:45.521]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:45.601 --> 00:59:46.822]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:03.004 --> 01:00:07.187]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:07.827 --> 01:00:08.648]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.428 --> 01:00:10.389]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:14.652]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.172 --> 01:00:19.275]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.619 --> 01:00:30.163]  Why in every case do tyrannies exterminate and murder people en masse?
[01:00:31.496 --> 01:00:33.097]  I'll break that down at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:34.579 --> 01:00:38.663]  Uh, Judith McGarry, who's been on with us many times in the past, had a family emergency.
[01:00:39.183 --> 01:00:44.288]  She still says she can be on via cell phone, but I want to get her on in the next few days from a landliner in studio.
[01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:46.330]  She actually lives outside, uh, Austin.
[01:00:47.591 --> 01:00:49.613]  Um, so I'll just leave it at that.
[01:00:49.653 --> 01:00:51.755]  A situation with hornets on a farm.
[01:00:51.795 --> 01:00:54.417]  I'll just, you can, uh, fill in the blank for yourself.
[01:00:55.358 --> 01:00:56.659]  Uh, so that is, uh,
[01:00:58.049 --> 01:01:14.779]  Something I'll still cover the farming situation some in the next hour and take your farming horror stories with the BLM The Forest Service and go over This legislation they're trying to ram through but They're trying to get it through this week.
[01:01:14.819 --> 01:01:20.063]  So if we can get her on the next few days but she still offered to come on again from the
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.563]  From the hospital, but we're not going to do that.
[01:01:24.603 --> 01:01:25.184]  She's fine.
[01:01:25.224 --> 01:01:26.847]  Her husband got stung by a bunch of hornets.
[01:01:27.047 --> 01:01:27.909]  He should be okay, but...
[01:01:28.843 --> 01:01:30.585]  I tell you, I got a bunch of those outside my house.
[01:01:30.625 --> 01:01:32.086]  Every time I kill them, they just come right back.
[01:01:32.566 --> 01:01:37.791]  And they roost up in the cracks by the eave of our house and killed them repeatedly.
[01:01:37.811 --> 01:01:40.553]  And they just keep... One time, my mom, I went over to her house.
[01:01:40.593 --> 01:01:43.476]  She'd been stung by a hornet, also a hornet's nest.
[01:01:43.976 --> 01:01:46.398]  You know, the big yellow and green ones.
[01:01:46.759 --> 01:01:47.660]  Stung her right between the eyes.
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.561]  Swallowed her eyes shut for a couple days.
[01:01:50.082 --> 01:01:52.764]  Those suckers are particularly
[01:01:54.944 --> 01:02:04.146]  I do want to go to your phone calls now.
[01:02:04.827 --> 01:02:06.407]  Let's talk to Nick in Illinois.
[01:02:06.467 --> 01:02:07.267]  Nick, you're on the air.
[01:02:07.287 --> 01:02:09.188]  Alex, how are you doing?
[01:02:09.488 --> 01:02:12.849]  I'm out of Illinois, like you said, and I'm a member of Campaign for Liberty.
[01:02:13.389 --> 01:02:17.170]  And I was trying to get more of a part of the Tea Party movement out here.
[01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:21.851]  So I did join a campaign recently, an independent conservative
[01:02:22.643 --> 01:02:28.127]  Uh, out here in Illinois, and I wanted to see if you could give us a little help in getting some exposure to him.
[01:02:31.809 --> 01:02:33.610]  Uh, flesh that out a little bit, what you were just saying.
[01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:37.453]  Uh, so I'm here with Robert Zedick's campaign.
[01:02:37.473 --> 01:02:39.254]  He's an independent conservative out of Illinois.
[01:02:39.719 --> 01:02:41.220]  And we need to get him a little exposure.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:47.402]  He's a writing candidate, and I was wondering if I could talk a little bit about him and just plug his website.
[01:02:47.782 --> 01:02:49.622]  Yeah, Nick, why don't you send me some information?
[01:02:49.642 --> 01:02:55.604]  I'm not big on plugging candidates I don't know about, but I appreciate your call, just because I want to do some research.
[01:02:55.624 --> 01:02:59.246]  But you can send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com, and I'll look at it.
[01:02:59.626 --> 01:03:03.547]  But I do want people to support all third-party alternative candidates if they're constitutionalists.
[01:03:04.367 --> 01:03:08.049]  Let's go ahead and talk to Denny in California.
[01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.849]  Denny, you're on the air.
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:12.240]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:12.500]  Good!
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.721]  I've been a huge fan since Endgame, man.
[01:03:15.761 --> 01:03:20.062]  I've been really helping people turn into the truth, man.
[01:03:20.082 --> 01:03:25.743]  So I just want to put it out there that everybody has to do something creative, do something, get out there and make change.
[01:03:25.783 --> 01:03:31.584]  Because if one person finds a way to get their message out there, then you've done a good thing, you know?
[01:03:32.964 --> 01:03:35.805]  My question for you is, where can I find anything really on
[01:03:38.601 --> 01:03:40.744]  They're homosexuality and they're child abuse.
[01:03:41.325 --> 01:03:48.477]  I heard there was a book out where this woman like escaped the bohemian grove and she wrote like a tell-all tale, but where can I find information on that?
[01:03:49.363 --> 01:03:51.644]  Well, you can find it in the headlines all the time.
[01:03:51.684 --> 01:03:59.326]  They constantly catch Homeland Security state directors, federal sub-directors, actually raping children or trying to.
[01:04:00.627 --> 01:04:06.008]  It's always coming out about large portions of CPS workers, truancy officers being into it.
[01:04:06.669 --> 01:04:11.270]  It's not that the Boy Scouts are bad, it's that predators try to go get near children.
[01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:14.391]  I mean, where are great white sharks off the coast of San Diego?
[01:04:14.751 --> 01:04:16.252]  They're where the seals are swimming.
[01:04:17.065 --> 01:04:20.446]  Well, child predators are going where the children are.
[01:04:21.007 --> 01:04:35.852]  And so the real criminals, they call them high-level, high-IQ criminals, whether they're psychopathic killers, bank fraud people, pedophiles, you name it, they try to get a badge and a gun, or they try to get government power.
[01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:45.116]  That's why tyranny tends to develop, because bad people want to get into positions of government power to protect themselves so they can carry out their operations.
[01:04:46.036 --> 01:04:49.039]  And so it's just all over the news that this is going on.
[01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:53.622]  Dinecor has been caught running giant child kidnapping rings and they're one of the main contractors in the U.S.
[01:04:53.642 --> 01:04:54.963]  that also runs CPS.
[01:04:55.504 --> 01:04:56.745]  So, I mean, it's just, it's everywhere.
[01:04:57.986 --> 01:04:58.746]  Listen up, friends.
[01:04:58.786 --> 01:05:00.728]  This is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:05:01.108 --> 01:05:04.631]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:05:04.911 --> 01:05:07.554]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:05:07.794 --> 01:05:12.718]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:03.001]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:03.361 --> 01:06:06.883]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:07.284 --> 01:06:09.505]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:09.525 --> 01:06:14.949]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:15.389 --> 01:06:21.673]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:22.053 --> 01:06:27.617]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:28.037 --> 01:06:31.700]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.181]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:36.481 --> 01:06:42.423]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:42.443 --> 01:06:45.384]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:45.985 --> 01:06:47.405]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:47.965 --> 01:06:48.465]  It's here.

[01:06:58.715 --> 01:07:13.188]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:07:14.189 --> 01:07:17.873]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:18.874 --> 01:07:30.886]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:07:31.646 --> 01:07:38.913]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.

[01:08:05.524 --> 01:08:13.787]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.527 --> 01:08:21.129]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I want to break down the cycles that society goes through.
[01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:30.652]  And I know we've been talking about this with Rhett Beckman and many others for 15 years, but I wanted to really quantify it and
[01:08:32.782 --> 01:08:35.004]  Talk about what it's going to be like to live under tyranny.
[01:08:35.024 --> 01:08:43.950]  I mean, we're already deep into it, but it's got a lot more to go by many levels of bad, from bad to worse.
[01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:47.172]  So I'm going to be talking about that, getting into the economy and a lot more.
[01:08:47.813 --> 01:08:49.914]  Let's go to Gail in Tennessee.
[01:08:49.974 --> 01:08:50.915]  You're on the air, Gail.
[01:08:50.935 --> 01:08:51.976]  Hi, Alex.
[01:08:52.396 --> 01:08:52.676]  Hi.
[01:08:53.477 --> 01:08:53.657]  Hi.
[01:08:53.677 --> 01:08:58.881]  The big news in Tennessee, I suppose you know, is Ernest Withers, FBI informant,
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:08.516]  And as a child, during Martin Luther King's assassination, growing up on images of I am a man, it was a shock.
[01:09:09.097 --> 01:09:11.240]  I had Jesse Ventura research that!
[01:09:12.586 --> 01:09:16.249]  Well, I mean, there's nothing to research but to fill folks in.
[01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:30.980]  When we had Dick Gregory on last week, he talked about how the Tennessee papers had just broken the story that the longtime photographer who took the famous photos of Jesse Jackson, pointing from where the shot came from when it wasn't where the shot came from.
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:36.925]  And, you know, basically none of them even ducked when Martin Luther King was shot, which everybody thought was very suspicious.
[01:09:37.485 --> 01:09:41.748]  And now it's admitted that he was an FBI informant tracking everything
[01:09:42.609 --> 01:09:48.455]  that King was doing and his friends who were also there were quoted as saying it was a good thing to do.
[01:09:49.116 --> 01:09:55.202]  And Dick Gregory made the point that that sounds like they know it's about to come out that they were FBI informants.
[01:09:56.343 --> 01:10:02.009]  And so, since you mentioned that story, I thought I would clarify it for folks that didn't know what we were talking about, Gail.
[01:10:02.893 --> 01:10:04.895]  Right, the Commercial Appeal broke the story.
[01:10:05.336 --> 01:10:14.266]  But the reason I'm calling is I saw one of those weird crop duster planes in the middle of the night a couple of months ago, and my kids were going, oh, it's mosquitoes.
[01:10:14.527 --> 01:10:15.748]  They're spraying for mosquitoes.
[01:10:15.808 --> 01:10:18.511]  And I've lived on this street all my life, and it's always a truck.
[01:10:19.594 --> 01:10:20.375]  I thought it was strange.
[01:10:20.435 --> 01:10:21.196]  It was 2 a.m.
[01:10:21.236 --> 01:10:24.560]  and all these chemicals were being sprayed with infrared light and across the street.
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:31.407]  Well, that's the bigger issue is that they do this at 2, 3, 4 in the morning and I've told the story.
[01:10:31.427 --> 01:10:32.869]  It must have been 8, 9 years ago.
[01:10:32.889 --> 01:10:35.091]  I've been working late on a film.
[01:10:35.572 --> 01:10:36.212]  Got home about 2.30 a.m.
[01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:41.158]  Close my car door, and at about 300 feet, a Cessna flew over.
[01:10:41.518 --> 01:10:47.424]  I could, right over my house, with the spray bottles under it, spraying some type of chemical.
[01:10:47.444 --> 01:10:48.686]  I mean, it hit me.
[01:10:49.026 --> 01:10:52.269]  I mean, I sat there like an idiot, wondering what it was, and then could smell it.
[01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:56.513]  And then I went and searched the term and it turned out they were doing moth eradication.
[01:10:57.074 --> 01:10:59.255]  But it turns out these chemicals are very toxic.
[01:10:59.716 --> 01:11:02.298]  But notice how the whole government does everything by stealth.
[01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:05.901]  They lie to you and say the naked body scanners don't have radiation.
[01:11:06.161 --> 01:11:08.083]  Turns out it is dangerous and can give you cancer.
[01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:10.284]  They say they're not saving the images.
[01:11:10.644 --> 01:11:12.785]  Turns out they are, and we're lying about it.
[01:11:13.185 --> 01:11:15.406]  I mean, they just lie as a course of action.
[01:11:15.666 --> 01:11:18.187]  Hey, the asbestos isn't bad for you at Ground Zero.
[01:11:18.587 --> 01:11:19.407]  Don't wear a mask.
[01:11:19.788 --> 01:11:23.269]  Because if they told you to wear a mask, you'd have to admit it was dangerous, then they'd have to pay claims.
[01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:26.250]  Hey, DU isn't bad for you, troops.
[01:11:26.651 --> 01:11:28.011]  Go ahead and use depleted uranium.
[01:11:28.311 --> 01:11:30.872]  Hey, Corexit, Obama says isn't bad for you.
[01:11:31.112 --> 01:11:32.453]  There's no health problems in the Gulf.
[01:11:32.753 --> 01:11:33.513]  We know that's a lie.
[01:11:33.954 --> 01:11:36.795]  And they're now spraying Corexit at night to cover up.
[01:11:37.853 --> 01:11:40.874]  And they lied and said 70% of the oil was cleaned.
[01:11:41.755 --> 01:11:42.975]  Turns out that's a lie.
[01:11:43.755 --> 01:11:45.336]  Almost everything they say is a lie.
[01:11:45.356 --> 01:11:46.076]  Anything else, Gayle?
[01:11:46.096 --> 01:11:51.759]  Well, I was just going to say, they're probably trying to make me sick, so I want his health care, which I don't.
[01:11:51.799 --> 01:11:57.901]  Because I stay healthy and I write a check when I get sick, knock on wood, but I don't want, you know, to be forced.
[01:11:58.464 --> 01:12:05.110]  With his health care, so... Well, that's what the health care is about, Gail, is taking your choice away under these new rules that they're phasing in.
[01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:10.234]  Bioethics boards will decide what treatment you can get, even if you have the money.
[01:12:11.155 --> 01:12:12.056]  Right, right.
[01:12:12.076 --> 01:12:12.757]  It's awful.
[01:12:13.357 --> 01:12:15.919]  But I respect what you're doing, and I just wanted to call in.
[01:12:15.939 --> 01:12:17.361]  There's so many things to talk about.
[01:12:17.381 --> 01:12:20.744]  Oh, yeah, the VA benefit.
[01:12:20.824 --> 01:12:25.468]  My uncle, who liberated Buchenwald, he's 88, he just got a bill
[01:12:26.007 --> 01:12:28.830]  Three years ago, the VA started to bill him for medicine.
[01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:30.352]  He was supposed to have benefits.
[01:12:30.432 --> 01:12:31.313]  It's really weird.
[01:12:32.134 --> 01:12:42.139]  I'm going to talk about that in a moment, but go back, because I interrupted you, go back to what type of plane was it?
[01:12:42.219 --> 01:12:43.099]  How low was it?
[01:12:43.499 --> 01:12:44.580]  What did you see in spring?
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:51.763]  Oh, and the reason I was up, it was right after school, and I have teenagers, so I'm worried is the car coming home especially, right?
[01:12:51.823 --> 01:12:54.224]  So I'm up, worrying about my teens being out.
[01:12:54.684 --> 01:12:58.026]  So I was, I mean, I was up, and I just looked out,
[01:12:58.912 --> 01:13:08.353]  And I thought it was fairly low but what was strange was the infrared light because it was the same night of a big marijuana bust here in Memphis and I've always heard that uh
[01:13:08.874 --> 01:13:13.998]  They always have this infrared technology where they're trying to find pot growers and all this.
[01:13:14.018 --> 01:13:16.941]  So I figured, oh, that plane's looking for the guy that got away.
[01:13:16.961 --> 01:13:18.142]  It was on the news he got away.
[01:13:18.662 --> 01:13:20.564]  But then, why do they have to spray?
[01:13:20.744 --> 01:13:22.385]  I mean, that doesn't match up.
[01:13:22.465 --> 01:13:23.826]  So I thought, well, that couldn't have been that.
[01:13:23.986 --> 01:13:26.308]  But if you have infrared light... Great points.
[01:13:26.368 --> 01:13:27.389]  I appreciate your call.
[01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:30.972]  For those that just tuned in and were listening to her,
[01:13:32.333 --> 01:13:42.697]  The problem with moth eradication, beetle eradication, you know, these moths and beetles that really can kill your trees, is that A, they keep it quasi-secret from the public.
[01:13:42.717 --> 01:13:43.577]  They don't advertise it.
[01:13:43.597 --> 01:13:48.859]  A lot of times people see this, they complain, they're told, shut up, conspiracy theorist.
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:50.620]  Later they learn it was true.
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:55.682]  So they lie about it, just like they lie and say, there's no mercury in the shots, then we prove there is.
[01:13:56.062 --> 01:13:57.743]  They say, okay, mercury's good for you.
[01:13:58.263 --> 01:14:00.684]  It's a culture of just lying automatically.
[01:14:02.752 --> 01:14:04.153]  I mean, we can't trust anything they do.
[01:14:04.533 --> 01:14:16.978]  But then you've got the tens of thousands of declassified admissions, and I cover just 20 or so of these in my film, Endgame, in one section, where they've released bubonic plague in England and the U.S.
[01:14:17.458 --> 01:14:22.320]  They've released nerve gas in San Francisco and New York and killed people.
[01:14:23.061 --> 01:14:27.743]  And in all these cases, they'll release bacteria, you name it, they'll have army doctors
[01:14:28.946 --> 01:14:41.491]  In civilian doctor, you know, white lab coats at the hospitals, in deals with the hospitals, to not tell the public they were just tested on, so when they come in, they can see what's happening.
[01:14:42.312 --> 01:14:43.552]  And this goes back to the 40s.
[01:14:44.033 --> 01:14:46.654]  Our government didn't just go bad a few years ago.
[01:14:47.474 --> 01:14:48.675]  Of course, it's all expanded.
[01:14:49.995 --> 01:14:51.156]  Now, previously under the
[01:14:52.967 --> 01:14:58.091]  Different laws they had on Freedom of Information Act, they would declassify this stuff 25 years after.
[01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:01.234]  Now they don't even declassify anything basically past the 90s.
[01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:06.838]  But, in some of the declassified examples, this shows you what they think of the troops.
[01:15:07.199 --> 01:15:13.324]  Before I segue into what she brought up about her family being charged for medical care, the World War II vet.
[01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:26.855]  In cases all over the United States, at Fort Detrick, Maryland, and at Los Alamos Laboratories, out west, everywhere.
[01:15:27.795 --> 01:15:36.321]  In one group of tests they did, thousands of GIs and thousands of their wives, and this is even in Time Magazine.
[01:15:36.701 --> 01:15:38.402]  I think I saw it in Time like 14 years ago.
[01:15:39.143 --> 01:15:42.405]  That's how I first learned about that particular case, and since then I've seen it other places.
[01:15:45.216 --> 01:15:52.061]  The woman would come in, but they also did it to the men for other health issues, and they'd say, honey, I got some prenatal vitamins for you.
[01:15:52.862 --> 01:15:57.765]  And they'd give them uranium or plutonium, or some cases both, a different test, pills.
[01:15:59.066 --> 01:16:11.776]  When they were pregnant, and then when the woman came rushing in a day later, they would be there and they'd even roll in film cameras and tape what they were doing to see what radiation did to a baby in the utero.
[01:16:12.913 --> 01:16:20.756]  And, you know, they told the scientists, look, if we hurt one woman, if we kill one baby, or we kill thousands, that'll save millions when the Russians nuke us.
[01:16:21.196 --> 01:16:27.379]  Meanwhile, our own government had funded the Russians, that's now been declassified, given them all the weapons to create the enemy.
[01:16:29.278 --> 01:16:33.360]  But it was really about creating cadres of doctors who would do anything.
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:42.543]  It was about testing them to see if they had these legions of death, these legions of doom, that would carry anything and everything out whenever they were told to.
[01:16:43.384 --> 01:16:50.086]  And so they'll send pilots up spraying stuff for moth eradication, or they'll send them up spraying for marijuana fields, or whatever.
[01:16:50.366 --> 01:16:53.367]  But then one day, they can put a biological on it.
[01:16:53.407 --> 01:16:54.548]  They can release the flu.
[01:16:54.828 --> 01:16:55.868]  And the pilot doesn't know.
[01:16:55.928 --> 01:16:56.889]  They're compartmentalized.
[01:16:57.819 --> 01:16:59.039]  Or they could release a nerve gas.
[01:16:59.079 --> 01:17:04.500]  They could release a deadly bioweapon, you know, that kills 99% of people that come in contact with it.
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:07.301]  The human version of mousepox, we know they've developed for this plan.
[01:17:07.721 --> 01:17:08.921]  That's probably what they'll go with.
[01:17:09.221 --> 01:17:16.723]  I mean, if I had to pick one of the many super-kill weapons they've got, it'll kill 99% of you, and they're really looking forward to releasing it.
[01:17:17.203 --> 01:17:24.285]  And, of course, we've got all these top environmentalists, people in the British government, saying we need to attack our cities with bioweapons.
[01:17:24.645 --> 01:17:25.325]  Airborne Ebola.
[01:17:26.448 --> 01:17:29.490]  And then you research them, they almost all work and buy all weapons.
[01:17:31.251 --> 01:17:33.512]  Boy, you can't put two and two together there, can you?
[01:17:35.113 --> 01:17:40.235]  I know some of you can, but I mean, some people out there are in such denial, they can't even see what's going on here.
[01:17:40.496 --> 01:17:42.056]  They want the world for themselves.
[01:17:42.076 --> 01:17:44.978]  This is their big adventure, their big decadent treat.
[01:17:45.358 --> 01:17:46.679]  This is something naughty.
[01:17:47.299 --> 01:17:48.400]  See, that's what corruption does.
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:52.082]  We'll get into it later, but they just get into doing more and more crazy things.
[01:17:52.122 --> 01:17:53.763]  That's the nature of humanity.
[01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:55.264]  It's the nature of this cycle.
[01:17:57.236 --> 01:18:12.778]  If they would give a GI vitamins and tell them they were vitamins when they were uranium, or plutonium, or strontium, or some other isotope, or if they nerve gassed people on the New York subway in 1968, what would they do to you now?
[01:18:13.837 --> 01:18:17.241]  Now remember last year I had the head of Veterans of Foreign Wars on.
[01:18:17.681 --> 01:18:18.903]  He was in the meeting with Obama.
[01:18:19.163 --> 01:18:31.537]  Obama said, I want to make a deal with you, we'll get you more government funding if you do it, to make all veterans, including current veterans, new veterans, new wounded people, pay for their own health care.
[01:18:32.822 --> 01:18:34.203]  And he said no, and he came on the show.
[01:18:34.463 --> 01:18:39.286]  Well, just by stealth, they already made the deal 11 years ago to take your death benefits when you die.
[01:18:39.867 --> 01:18:41.308]  You've paid for that insurance over your life.
[01:18:42.628 --> 01:18:44.730]  Or to make vets pay for their own health care.
[01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:49.453]  Or make them pay for their own meals when they're at Rammstein with their legs blown off, flown out of Iraq.
[01:18:50.788 --> 01:18:53.410]  Again, they don't like you.
[01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:54.430]  They hate you.
[01:18:54.751 --> 01:19:00.274]  And they get you all jazzed up about America and we're a Christian army fighting the Muslims and all this brainwashing.
[01:19:00.915 --> 01:19:10.461]  It's nothing but a fake template that they basically download into you through the conditioning, through the re-education system that we all live in.
[01:19:11.468 --> 01:19:13.189]  And you are hated.
[01:19:13.309 --> 01:19:16.111]  You are seen as a weapon that's been used.
[01:19:16.731 --> 01:19:17.952]  And what do they do to an old cannon?
[01:19:17.972 --> 01:19:18.552]  They spike it.
[01:19:18.852 --> 01:19:20.113]  What do they do to an old battleship?
[01:19:20.173 --> 01:19:20.833]  They cut it up.
[01:19:21.614 --> 01:19:24.716]  Or they take it off and sink it off the coast and make an artificial reef.
[01:19:25.596 --> 01:19:28.118]  You are to be decommissioned.
[01:19:30.419 --> 01:19:31.640]  We don't have a government.
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.401]  We don't have a country.
[01:19:33.641 --> 01:19:35.342]  It was taken over by offshore ruthless
[01:19:36.542 --> 01:19:41.006]  Eugenicists controlled global corporations decades ago, conservatively.
[01:19:41.626 --> 01:19:45.449]  They now have near full spectrum dominance over everything but your mind.
[01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:53.116]  You must realize, if you're a veteran, a police officer, everybody that serves this system, they hate you more than anyone.
[01:19:53.696 --> 01:19:56.959]  And when they're done using you, they will rob, they will steal.
[01:19:57.159 --> 01:19:58.400]  You notice all the vaccines they give you?
[01:19:58.874 --> 01:20:02.499]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[01:20:02.799 --> 01:20:06.344]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[01:20:59.025 --> 01:21:01.326]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:21:01.346 --> 01:21:03.587]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:03.607 --> 01:21:06.508]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:06.828 --> 01:21:11.669]  The Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:12.029 --> 01:21:16.231]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:21:16.531 --> 01:21:18.893]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:21:18.993 --> 01:21:21.416]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:21:21.436 --> 01:21:24.358]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:21:24.699 --> 01:21:32.286]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:21:32.634 --> 01:21:37.878]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:40.280]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:44.323]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:21:44.563 --> 01:21:45.503]  And I got news for you.
[01:21:45.624 --> 01:21:46.944]  You're everyone else.
[01:21:46.964 --> 01:21:48.005]  Invisible Empire.

[01:23:58.226 --> 01:23:59.449]  Found out about her back in 2008.
[01:24:04.378 --> 01:24:06.479]  It was the weekend before the November election.
[01:24:06.939 --> 01:24:17.684]  Democratic presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, started getting questions about his aunt, Zeytunyi Onyeng'o of Kenya, an illegal immigrant living in public housing in Boston.
[01:24:18.104 --> 01:24:22.166]  You're here illegally, and he's running for the President of the United States, that's what I'm saying is.
[01:24:22.446 --> 01:24:25.227]  Listen, Obama did not know my whereabouts.
[01:24:25.608 --> 01:24:30.270]  For the first time, Zeytunyi is setting the record straight, sitting down with me for this interview.
[01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:35.774]  She had come to the United States in 2000 and says she had every intention of going back to Kenya.
[01:24:36.234 --> 01:24:39.736]  But she says she got sick and spent time in a hospital and nearly died.
[01:24:40.337 --> 01:24:49.284]  To me, American's dream became my American's worst nightmare.
[01:24:50.024 --> 01:24:50.244]  Why?
[01:24:51.245 --> 01:24:52.726]  Because of what I have gone through.
[01:24:53.547 --> 01:24:54.467]  Tell me what you've gone through.
[01:24:55.708 --> 01:24:56.849]  It's a hell of a lot.
[01:24:57.850 --> 01:24:58.951]  Hell of a lot.
[01:24:59.685 --> 01:25:02.608]  She became political fodder intended to hurt her nephew.
[01:25:03.049 --> 01:25:05.251]  She also became a focal point of anger.
[01:25:05.812 --> 01:25:10.377]  How could Zeytuny be here illegally for years, living in government housing?
[01:25:10.397 --> 01:25:14.262]  I have been treated like a public enemy, number one.
[01:25:17.814 --> 01:25:24.937]  Okay, at about 40 after or so, I'm going to start getting into my little mini rant about the cycles that society goes through and really what we're facing.
[01:25:24.957 --> 01:25:33.961]  We know 100% what we're facing and everything that's happening, all the craziness gone to seed, corruption gone to seed, is done by design to break your will.
[01:25:34.501 --> 01:25:40.924]  So we're going to explain that coming up, but right now let's go to Corrine and then Alonzo, Jason, Hunter, and Bryce.
[01:25:40.964 --> 01:25:43.205]  I'll at least get to those calls before I get into those subjects.
[01:25:43.785 --> 01:25:46.447]  Let's talk to Corrine in Texas.
[01:25:46.467 --> 01:25:46.827]  Go ahead.
[01:25:47.796 --> 01:25:50.138]  Hello, Alex, thank you so much for waking me up.
[01:25:50.218 --> 01:25:53.700]  I tell everyone about your films, and I think your work is just great.
[01:25:54.481 --> 01:25:55.582]  I have three quick points.
[01:25:56.242 --> 01:25:58.124]  Oprah has just come out in support.
[01:25:58.184 --> 01:26:02.967]  Her book club has picked Freedom, a novel by Jonathan Friesen.
[01:26:03.528 --> 01:26:13.175]  And this novel basically says that freedom is bad, because if we're free, then we're going to become a decadent society, and it's really bad.
[01:26:13.215 --> 01:26:14.396]  Yeah, yeah, that's their answer!
[01:26:14.716 --> 01:26:22.218]  See, see, they confuse the decadent cycle, which they're all reporting on, Camille Paglia, you name it.
[01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:29.232]  The media then takes that information and confuses it that freedom causes the decadence and the evil.
[01:26:29.312 --> 01:26:29.552]  No.
[01:26:30.332 --> 01:26:35.253]  Not respecting liberty and freedom and not defending it brings tyranny.
[01:26:36.793 --> 01:26:38.694]  And so they're basically trying to scramble it.
[01:26:39.054 --> 01:26:42.995]  I mean, look, she funds a giant UN brainwashing church in Africa.
[01:26:43.015 --> 01:26:45.196]  A lot of people like Oprah Winfrey.
[01:26:45.436 --> 01:26:46.796]  She supported Barack Obama.
[01:26:47.356 --> 01:26:51.518]  Unfortunately, some talk show hosts here on Genesis did, which was pretty shameful, but we forgive them for that.
[01:26:52.018 --> 01:27:01.023]  A lot of bad decisions, but I think that overall, Oprah Winfrey is super bad news, and it's modern mind control.
[01:27:01.063 --> 01:27:01.383]  Go ahead.
[01:27:01.997 --> 01:27:04.538]  Well, I used to like her, and you really woke me up to her.
[01:27:05.659 --> 01:27:18.264]  What I would like your listeners to consider is going to Amazon and writing a one-star review and putting in there something about, you know, freedom is what made this country great, the Constitution is what made this country great.
[01:27:19.037 --> 01:27:22.939]  And if we all did a review, it will just overwhelm her.
[01:27:23.039 --> 01:27:29.021]  And now the decadent slobs tell us to capitulate to their tyranny because our freedom is bad.
[01:27:29.081 --> 01:27:32.822]  My freedom to own a gun and not be afraid at night is evil.
[01:27:32.862 --> 01:27:34.583]  My freedom to own property is bad.
[01:27:34.683 --> 01:27:34.923]  No!
[01:27:35.403 --> 01:27:38.404]  As the freedom is phased out, we now get tyranny.
[01:27:38.445 --> 01:27:40.265]  It's the opposite of what this writer is saying.
[01:27:40.505 --> 01:27:42.046]  I haven't read the book, but what you're saying is true.
[01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:45.732]  Yeah, the book is called Freedom A Novel by Jonathan Frenzen.
[01:27:45.772 --> 01:27:51.336]  I think we can really make a difference if your listeners just go to Amazon and write a review about it and say that we want freedom.
[01:27:51.356 --> 01:27:55.058]  What else is there but, you know... So what, he says we need a benevolent tyranny?
[01:27:55.319 --> 01:27:57.620]  That's what all of the environmentalists are saying.
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:27:59.381]  They're the high and mighty ones.
[01:27:59.742 --> 01:28:01.703]  They say we've got to kill the majority of people.
[01:28:01.883 --> 01:28:11.870]  I mean, they're out in the open saying this and the public is so anesthetized with media and culture that they're just... have no respect for themselves and aren't resisting it.
[01:28:12.765 --> 01:28:18.867]  I'd also like your listeners to be really aware of how much subliminal messaging happens on TV.
[01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:28.649]  If you Google the words Oprah Deception, you'll see very clearly at the White House interview with Michelle Obama, they show a picture of Obama made to look like Lincoln.
[01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:31.810]  Now, you may or may not like Lincoln, but many people think he's good.
[01:28:32.110 --> 01:28:35.991]  And that is a powerful image in Brave New World Revisited page 98.
[01:28:36.131 --> 01:28:37.392]  Well, that's not even subliminal.
[01:28:37.412 --> 01:28:38.412]  I mean, that's overt.
[01:28:39.332 --> 01:28:45.534]  They take many different forms of propaganda and weave them together, but the truth can cut right through it like a hot knife through butter.
[01:28:46.755 --> 01:28:57.458]  Yeah, I mean it's, but it actually is just a very brief flash on the screen, and you know, people, these people aren't stupid, they know what works, and they do it because it does work.
[01:28:58.188 --> 01:29:05.736]  Well, Oprah Winfrey has done a few good things like exposing Mad Cow and things, and then she's been kind of slapped around.
[01:29:06.096 --> 01:29:11.341]  Pat Robertson had 30-plus different TV channels, then they tried to take his tax exemption in the mid-90s.
[01:29:11.721 --> 01:29:15.926]  He suddenly flipped to being totally pro-world government, not that he was perfect before that.
[01:29:16.466 --> 01:29:19.769]  And so I don't like to just sit up here and judge Oprah, but...
[01:29:22.833 --> 01:29:26.835]  I mean, that whole world religion thing she's pushing is super bad news.
[01:29:27.215 --> 01:29:28.255]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:28.855 --> 01:29:34.598]  All right, Alonzo, Jason, Hunter, Bryce, and others, your calls are coming up straight ahead.
[01:29:35.118 --> 01:29:39.960]  Then I'm going to get into a bunch of news and also talk about the cycles that we go through as a society.
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:47.283]  It's very important because we are starting the accelerated downward descent into just hardcore despotism.
[01:29:48.724 --> 01:29:49.644]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.124 --> 01:29:51.645]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.646 --> 01:29:55.408]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:57.657 --> 01:31:01.900]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:02.820]  Number one.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:06.282]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:06.543 --> 01:31:07.123]  Number two.
[01:31:07.403 --> 01:31:11.966]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:12.306 --> 01:31:12.747]  It's true.
[01:31:13.047 --> 01:31:17.610]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:18.450]  Number three.
[01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:22.032]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:22.333 --> 01:31:26.035]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:26.215 --> 01:31:26.776]  Number 4.
[01:31:27.016 --> 01:31:29.379]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:29.779 --> 01:31:33.164]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:33.464 --> 01:31:33.684]  Number 5.
[01:31:34.265 --> 01:31:38.190]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:38.410 --> 01:31:43.176]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:43.456 --> 01:31:47.477]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:31:57.475 --> 01:32:01.418]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:32:01.658 --> 01:32:07.702]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:32:08.062 --> 01:32:15.167]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:32:15.467 --> 01:32:20.010]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:32:29.001 --> 01:32:32.726]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:32:33.246 --> 01:32:39.412]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:32:40.013 --> 01:32:43.436]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:32:43.916 --> 01:32:51.224]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:32:51.344 --> 01:32:51.804]  Thank you.
[01:32:59.998 --> 01:33:00.719]  Big Brother.
[01:33:01.699 --> 01:33:02.980]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:04.021 --> 01:33:05.142]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:05.802 --> 01:33:07.243]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:07.904 --> 01:33:09.245]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:10.025 --> 01:33:14.649]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.546 --> 01:33:31.517]  We're being trained, we're having our back broken, psychologically, to just accept Barack Obama's aunt saying, I came here illegally, and you owe me full welfare and disability and you're gonna pay it.
[01:33:31.537 --> 01:33:34.240]  And we haven't even taken a call, who's upset about it?
[01:33:35.481 --> 01:33:39.564]  And you know, callers aren't even, don't sound too upset, I'm not criticizing anybody.
[01:33:39.844 --> 01:33:42.967]  People are bringing up good points, but people don't even seem to have a problem.
[01:33:43.959 --> 01:33:50.001]  With what I've been reporting on for two weeks, that six million veterans are having their death benefits stolen when they die.
[01:33:51.001 --> 01:33:54.103]  And it's in the news, and the system says, well, they're going to take that.
[01:33:55.103 --> 01:33:57.304]  Okay, let's start taking part of all their pension funds.
[01:33:58.184 --> 01:34:00.885]  Let's start harassing and shutting down their farms and ranches.
[01:34:03.446 --> 01:34:04.086]  Let's just do it.
[01:34:04.886 --> 01:34:06.267]  I mean, if they'll put up with it, let's do it.
[01:34:07.587 --> 01:34:08.728]  And they're gauging all of it.
[01:34:10.376 --> 01:34:12.557]  It's not just going to stay at this one point of corruption.
[01:34:12.637 --> 01:34:13.838]  It's going to get worse and worse.
[01:34:13.858 --> 01:34:15.099]  I'm going to talk about that after calls.
[01:34:15.879 --> 01:34:26.565]  But briefly here, we've had a few specials in the last few months that have been extremely popular, and we have offered previously four copies of the Obama deception.
[01:34:26.585 --> 01:34:32.929]  There isn't a better tool to wake people up to the false left-right paradigm, how Obama was financed by Wall Street just like McCain.
[01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:39.733]  That way they own both fighters in the fight, all the horses in the race, both sides of the football scrimmage line.
[01:34:40.816 --> 01:34:46.218]  This film, you may be awake, you may know all this information, your friends, your family, your neighbors don't.
[01:34:46.578 --> 01:34:56.702]  There's an online free bibliography for the film that goes through every second of the documentary with proof and links to legislation, to documents, to the quotes, to the video clips.
[01:34:57.142 --> 01:34:58.303]  The Obama deception.
[01:34:58.443 --> 01:35:01.964]  Now America and the world is ready to see this film.
[01:35:02.304 --> 01:35:03.425]  You can get a copy of this
[01:35:04.085 --> 01:35:10.207]  And when you do, get a free copy of Jesse Ventura with Dick Russell, New York Times bestseller, American Conspiracies.
[01:35:10.247 --> 01:35:12.468]  And we're going to end this special very, very soon.
[01:35:12.508 --> 01:35:14.609]  It's a $24.95 free book.
[01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:20.651]  So that's, what, a $44.95 value for $19.95.
[01:35:21.191 --> 01:35:29.734]  And the meager profit we make from it supports this radio broadcast and makes what we do here possible, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:30.154 --> 01:35:36.420]  So, that special's going, and even if you know this information, buy the book, the DVD to support us, and then give the book and DVD to friends and family.
[01:35:36.761 --> 01:35:44.308]  It's a great gift, or save it and give it away at Christmas, or give them their present and say, here it is early, this information can't wait, watch this information.
[01:35:44.949 --> 01:35:50.675]  Now, that special we offered that was the most popular we'd done in a long time, where you could get four films for $19.95,
[01:35:53.459 --> 01:36:05.865]  The film that I think is my most important, I mean obviously the Obama deception has been the most effective, but a film that I think was three hours long with expanded extras on top of it, is in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:36:06.185 --> 01:36:08.346]  On the back of the DVD it says they want you dead.
[01:36:08.706 --> 01:36:11.267]  For the new world order a world government is just the beginning.
[01:36:11.787 --> 01:36:17.810]  Once in place they can engage their plan to exterminate eighty percent of the world's population while enabling the elites to live forever.
[01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.911]  That's what they believe.
[01:36:19.311 --> 01:36:20.171]  Not saying that's true.
[01:36:20.271 --> 01:36:21.092]  They say this.
[01:36:21.832 --> 01:36:23.333]  With the aid of advanced technology.
[01:36:23.653 --> 01:36:29.876]  For the first time, crusading filmmaker Alex Jones reveals her secret plan for humanity's extermination, Operation Endgame.
[01:36:30.676 --> 01:36:35.059]  And what does Homeland Security call the mass roundup plan that came out a year after this film was made?
[01:36:35.439 --> 01:36:36.399]  Operation Endgame.
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:39.281]  And they've got a bunch of programs called Endgame.
[01:36:39.461 --> 01:36:42.362]  They've got a eugenics program we discovered afterwards called Endgame.
[01:36:42.682 --> 01:36:45.784]  I could just see what it was and the term Endgame.
[01:36:48.012 --> 01:36:48.733]  Four copies.
[01:36:49.413 --> 01:36:48.733]  1995.
[01:36:49.673 --> 01:36:51.195]  Four copies.
[01:36:51.355 --> 01:36:53.757]  Get it and give it to your friends and family.
[01:36:54.077 --> 01:36:55.098]  Air it on AXS TV.
[01:36:55.118 --> 01:36:55.719]  Make copies.
[01:36:56.219 --> 01:37:02.925]  But people are more apt to watch it when it's a nice color cover with the back, you know, the nice DVD imprint on the top.
[01:37:04.437 --> 01:37:08.140]  We're going to run this for two weeks, or while supplies last.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:12.724]  It probably won't, because I'm going to reprint them, but when we start running low, I'll have to pull it.
[01:37:12.764 --> 01:37:14.846]  And it may be a week, it may be two days, I don't know.
[01:37:15.206 --> 01:37:16.327]  We don't have that many of these.
[01:37:16.688 --> 01:37:21.852]  Four copies, $19.95, and your purchase makes the radio broadcast possible.
[01:37:22.253 --> 01:37:26.316]  Also what makes the broadcast possible is PrisonPlanet.tv memberships.
[01:37:26.737 --> 01:37:28.998]  You get my book, Paul Watson's book, both out of print.
[01:37:29.759 --> 01:37:44.811]  Other great films up there that the filmmakers have asked us to post in the highest quality, like Camp FEMA, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, United We Fall about the North American Union, stunning film.
[01:37:45.031 --> 01:37:46.472]  That's just some of the stuff in the last few months.
[01:37:46.812 --> 01:37:54.798]  My weekly TV show, my daily TV show that simulcasts with the radio, The Sunday Show, Archives going back seven years, almost seven years.
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:58.101]  All my films are super high quality.
[01:37:59.258 --> 01:38:02.200]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:06.142]  $5.95 a month, the cost of two Starbucks coffees, and you finance our operation.
[01:38:06.482 --> 01:38:09.084]  And you can also share your passcode with six people.
[01:38:09.904 --> 01:38:10.685]  Technically five.
[01:38:11.145 --> 01:38:14.187]  You can have six people logged on at once with the same passcode.
[01:38:14.627 --> 01:38:24.853]  If you give it away to too many people, they'll start logging you out or not letting you log in when people with your passcode are logged on, if more than six are.
[01:38:27.065 --> 01:38:29.506]  And people say, well, give it all away free.
[01:38:29.786 --> 01:38:33.147]  The Obama deception, watch more than 30 million times for free online.
[01:38:33.447 --> 01:38:34.087]  It is free.
[01:38:34.767 --> 01:38:36.108]  Everything I do is free.
[01:38:36.868 --> 01:38:42.590]  But you get it in higher quality, you get it first, you get it all in one spot for $5.95 a month.
[01:38:43.970 --> 01:38:44.270]  Okay?
[01:38:44.491 --> 01:38:49.992]  But I can't have high quality bandwidth and give that away free as well.
[01:38:50.012 --> 01:38:51.853]  I mean, our bandwidth cost
[01:38:54.312 --> 01:38:57.733]  We've done some juggling, but it's over $20,000 a month.
[01:38:57.813 --> 01:39:01.355]  And believe me, we're getting as close to the cheapest as you can get.
[01:39:01.995 --> 01:39:04.016]  If we bought even more, it might be a little bit less.
[01:39:04.076 --> 01:39:06.197]  But I mean, it's... What are we using?
[01:39:07.838 --> 01:39:09.198]  Just on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:09.258 --> 01:39:09.898]  What is it, Matt?
[01:39:09.918 --> 01:39:11.619]  Over 100 terabytes a month?
[01:39:15.672 --> 01:39:17.513]  Over a hundred terabytes.
[01:39:18.193 --> 01:39:19.754]  Ask one of the IT guys, he'll be able to tell me.
[01:39:21.335 --> 01:39:23.136]  It's a hundred something, I think it's a terabyte, yeah.
[01:39:23.636 --> 01:39:25.517]  A hundred terabytes.
[01:39:26.918 --> 01:39:29.880]  Matt, I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to the other IT guy named Matt.
[01:39:31.941 --> 01:39:34.502]  A hundred terabytes a month.
[01:39:35.243 --> 01:39:37.424]  One hundred terabytes and growing.
[01:39:37.904 --> 01:39:39.465]  The Higher Quality Podcast.
[01:39:39.765 --> 01:39:41.566]  It's all there at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:44.508 --> 01:39:44.828]  Okay.
[01:39:45.969 --> 01:39:46.950]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:48.811]  Alonzo, thanks for holding from Arkansas.
[01:39:48.831 --> 01:39:49.352]  You're on the air.
[01:39:50.112 --> 01:39:50.833]  He just dropped.
[01:39:51.153 --> 01:39:52.714]  Jason in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:39:54.596 --> 01:39:55.417]  Hello, Alex.
[01:39:55.557 --> 01:39:55.917]  Hey, buddy.
[01:39:56.978 --> 01:39:57.578]  Hey, Alex.
[01:39:57.598 --> 01:39:58.299]  How you doing today, man?
[01:39:58.399 --> 01:39:58.599]  Good.
[01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:00.481]  Good, good.
[01:40:00.501 --> 01:40:03.343]  I just want to make some comments and a couple points here.
[01:40:04.043 --> 01:40:13.851]  I don't know if you've noticed or any of the listeners noticed, but the grocery stores, all the grocery stores have little barcodes, barcoded swipey cards that you get a discount with.
[01:40:15.077 --> 01:40:16.578]  All that information is stored.
[01:40:17.359 --> 01:40:24.063]  Well, I lost my card to get the discount, and I went to the service counter to get a new card.
[01:40:24.584 --> 01:40:27.726]  And the girl that was helping me, she laid the cards down right there.
[01:40:28.126 --> 01:40:30.167]  They're just kind of laying there, prepared.
[01:40:30.207 --> 01:40:32.069]  You know, you tear them off and you use them.
[01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:35.071]  And I just kind of tuck them and put them in my pocket.
[01:40:35.471 --> 01:40:39.854]  Then she turned around to get me an application for all my information to go with that card.
[01:40:40.554 --> 01:40:41.995]  And I said, no, I'm not filling that out.
[01:40:43.316 --> 01:40:44.157]  She goes apes.
[01:40:44.932 --> 01:40:49.915]  Her manager comes over, starts yelling at her, why did you give him the cards without the information?
[01:40:50.735 --> 01:40:53.136]  And, I mean, it was a big ordeal right there at the grocery store.
[01:40:53.156 --> 01:40:54.117]  Well, let me explain something.
[01:40:54.137 --> 01:40:55.618]  There's nothing for free.
[01:40:56.098 --> 01:40:58.939]  There's no free lunch when you're dealing with these people.
[01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:03.902]  It's admitted with Target and Safeway and all these groups.
[01:41:04.302 --> 01:41:08.945]  This has come out over a decade ago that they learn what you've got to buy.
[01:41:09.665 --> 01:41:17.627]  They learn what you'll absolutely pay for, and they basically calculate it at the end of the day to charge you higher prices.
[01:41:17.928 --> 01:41:21.008]  And then they sell the data, and that's come out.
[01:41:21.429 --> 01:41:22.529]  So, absolutely.
[01:41:22.929 --> 01:41:24.310]  And boy, they'll really push.
[01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:25.350]  I'll be at Barnes & Noble.
[01:41:26.195 --> 01:41:27.676]  Buying some children's books or whatever.
[01:41:28.037 --> 01:41:29.338]  And they'll push and push and push.
[01:41:29.358 --> 01:41:32.701]  I even had a guy, like a week ago, go, what's wrong Alex?
[01:41:32.741 --> 01:41:34.102]  Big brother gonna get ya?
[01:41:34.122 --> 01:41:39.647]  And so these slaves get into the enslavement.
[01:41:40.027 --> 01:41:41.848]  It's like giggling fun for them.
[01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:46.212]  And so certainly they're training us to have to have a card.
[01:41:46.252 --> 01:41:52.877]  It's also Pavlovian psychological conditioning to swipe a card, even if you pay cash, to buy and sell.
[01:41:53.237 --> 01:41:57.360]  They want to force you with the new national sales tax, which they have neocons pushing.
[01:41:57.380 --> 01:41:58.781]  They'll have that on top of the income tax.
[01:41:58.821 --> 01:41:59.501]  They won't get rid of it.
[01:42:00.362 --> 01:42:03.945]  They won't get rid of one and add the new to track everything you buy, sell and do.
[01:42:03.985 --> 01:42:05.146]  Oh, you've had too much ice cream.
[01:42:05.166 --> 01:42:06.247]  You've had too much beer.
[01:42:06.627 --> 01:42:08.168]  Now the tax kicks in.
[01:42:08.548 --> 01:42:13.833]  Or if it's a sales tax, they'll have to know what graduated sales tax you're in when they're implementing it.
[01:42:14.013 --> 01:42:15.074]  And this has all been announced.
[01:42:15.194 --> 01:42:17.155]  I mean, I knew about this many years ago.
[01:42:17.515 --> 01:42:18.416]  Now it's all happening.
[01:42:19.457 --> 01:42:20.057]  Absolutely.
[01:42:20.077 --> 01:42:21.939]  And another another quick point I wanted to make to you.
[01:42:22.330 --> 01:42:28.817]  I live in Maryville, Tennessee, which is the twin city to Alcoa, Aluminum Company of America, Alcoa, Tennessee.
[01:42:28.917 --> 01:42:31.840]  And that's where a lot of the sodium fluoride that goes in our water comes from?
[01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:42.912]  Hey man, they're coming into our city limits, any main road coming into our city limits of Maryville, there's this government state looking sign that says fluoridated water.
[01:42:43.456 --> 01:42:46.558]  I mean, it's on every entrance of every city limit.
[01:42:46.698 --> 01:42:51.000]  But it's because they care about your teeth, not because it gives you a massive IQ reduction, as they admit.
[01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:52.200]  It's because they love you.
[01:42:52.581 --> 01:42:53.641]  They care about you.
[01:42:54.281 --> 01:43:03.886]  And that's why... There's a local... I'm sorry, there's a local doctor here in town that's been practicing family medicine for 50 years, and he goes on the radio promoting fluoride.
[01:43:03.906 --> 01:43:04.407]  Good for you.
[01:43:06.816 --> 01:43:14.922]  I'm talking to him, he's a customer, and we're talking about the fluoride, and then I finally get him to admit to me that, yes, fluoride is arsenic.
[01:43:15.603 --> 01:43:15.783]  Okay.
[01:43:16.263 --> 01:43:17.364]  Yeah, fluoride is poison.
[01:43:17.384 --> 01:43:18.325]  He finally admits that to me.
[01:43:18.645 --> 01:43:27.733]  So I tell the good doctor, I say, okay, I got some pure, fresh, filtered drinking water back here, doc, and I'm just going to put a little tiny bit of rat poison, a little bit of strychnine in there.
[01:43:27.773 --> 01:43:29.594]  I mean, the parts per billion, you won't even notice it.
[01:43:29.614 --> 01:43:30.215]  Will you drink it?
[01:43:30.475 --> 01:43:31.676]  Well, that's poison.
[01:43:31.956 --> 01:43:32.397]  Why would I?
[01:43:32.937 --> 01:43:35.059]  And then he kind of stopped and thought about what he was saying.
[01:43:37.132 --> 01:43:38.352]  I mean, it's right there.
[01:43:38.412 --> 01:43:39.573]  I mean, good for your teeth.
[01:43:39.653 --> 01:43:40.694]  It passes by the teeth.
[01:43:40.774 --> 01:43:41.615]  It goes into the belly.
[01:43:41.635 --> 01:43:42.555]  How's that helping the teeth?
[01:43:42.675 --> 01:43:44.196]  Jason, I appreciate your call.
[01:43:44.317 --> 01:43:52.142]  Look, do you drink sunscreen to not get a sunburn?
[01:43:53.203 --> 01:43:53.403]  No.
[01:43:54.584 --> 01:43:57.025]  You don't drink sunscreen to not get a sunburn.
[01:43:59.207 --> 01:44:01.708]  You don't drink sunscreen to not get a sunburn.
[01:44:01.749 --> 01:44:02.229]  Very simple.
[01:44:03.513 --> 01:44:15.581]  Now, the American Dental Association, what, now six years ago, I kept saying five years ago, but time flies, said children under six should not ingest fluoride because it causes dental fluorosis.
[01:44:16.342 --> 01:44:17.443]  It weakens your teeth.
[01:44:18.203 --> 01:44:19.324]  It screws your teeth up.
[01:44:19.404 --> 01:44:28.070]  But when you hear the term fluoride, the reason that doctor was honest is there's hundreds of chemicals, over 300, they can legally put in your water,
[01:44:29.696 --> 01:44:30.937]  And call it fluoride.
[01:44:31.437 --> 01:44:51.414]  So they take the aluminum smelting byproducts, they take the, from cracking the oil, from breaking it down from crude, they use fluoride to do that, deadly, and they take the byproducts of fertilizer production and they put it in your water.
[01:44:52.794 --> 01:44:56.057]  And you can go read the list of this stuff, but again, it's insane.
[01:44:56.117 --> 01:44:56.997]  Get it out of our water.
[01:44:57.238 --> 01:44:59.579]  You're not doing it to help us, you're doing it to brain damage us.
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.141]  We have a criminal government.
[01:45:01.681 --> 01:45:05.264]  And they're now out on the news saying we want to put lithium in your water to make you submit.
[01:45:05.884 --> 01:45:07.666]  We want to give you a shot to make you submit.
[01:45:07.946 --> 01:45:10.588]  I mean, they've gone from denying it to admitting it.
[01:45:12.710 --> 01:45:18.815]  Suddenly, every day all over the news, I covered it yesterday, there's multiple headlines about eco-fascism and how great tyranny is.
[01:45:18.895 --> 01:45:21.156]  I mean, they're not playing games, folks.
[01:45:22.059 --> 01:45:23.180]  That's why I get so frustrated.
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:25.001]  This is all admitted.
[01:45:25.622 --> 01:45:27.203]  Let's go to Hunter in Florida.
[01:45:27.223 --> 01:45:27.924]  Hunter, you're on the air.
[01:45:28.864 --> 01:45:33.728]  Alex, first, thank you for being an integral part of waking me up and finding my purpose in life.
[01:45:33.768 --> 01:45:35.890]  Thank you very much, PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.430]  Thank you.
[01:45:38.692 --> 01:45:40.974]  First point, actually, I want to make is activism.
[01:45:40.994 --> 01:45:43.236]  I think if we all, as sheeple,
[01:45:43.872 --> 01:45:50.375]  For lack of a better term, take one topic in our town with the abundance of people that are awake out there, we can make a difference.
[01:45:50.776 --> 01:45:55.898]  How I took my topic is I'm meeting with my city water director to have fluoride pulled out of our water.
[01:45:56.098 --> 01:45:57.439]  It's a very simple topic.
[01:45:57.499 --> 01:46:00.921]  If you get the right people, you get in front of the right people, ask the right questions.
[01:46:00.941 --> 01:46:02.602]  Well, you can also file suit!
[01:46:03.522 --> 01:46:16.367]  And make them admit that there's hundreds of chemicals they're adding in the name of fluoride, and bring into the lawsuit the union of EPA scientists saying take it out multiple times in the last 11 years.
[01:46:16.987 --> 01:46:19.748]  And, I mean, are they allowed to forcibly medicate you?
[01:46:20.169 --> 01:46:22.590]  Are they allowed to give you something that causes bone cancer?
[01:46:23.010 --> 01:46:26.031]  Again, where are the ambulance-chasing lawyers on this?
[01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:31.132]  Absolutely, and you go to drug.com, it looks fluoride as a drug.
[01:46:31.292 --> 01:46:34.293]  It should be induced and monitored and all this stuff.
[01:46:34.573 --> 01:46:35.954]  It's just absolutely asinine.
[01:46:35.994 --> 01:46:38.175]  It's ridiculous the way this process works.
[01:46:38.215 --> 01:46:39.355]  Well, you know what he's going to tell you.
[01:46:39.395 --> 01:46:46.818]  He's going to say it's state law, which is really a mandate, not even really a law, that if they get their federal funds, they've got to put it in the water.
[01:46:47.979 --> 01:46:53.261]  And then you need to point out that's a regulation, not a law, and just start getting with people and never stop.
[01:46:54.386 --> 01:46:58.471]  Luckily, I found out three years ago, they pulled it out for budgetary reasons.
[01:46:58.551 --> 01:47:00.354]  It's not state mandated, luckily.
[01:47:02.036 --> 01:47:05.160]  But, funny enough, who comes down from Tallahassee?
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:09.686]  The entire dental lobby to put it in front of the city commission that we need it back in.
[01:47:09.906 --> 01:47:21.048]  That's because they, through the American Dental Association and the American Medical Association, they tell those people what to do and these big businesses that are putting the poison in the water give money to these associations.
[01:47:21.108 --> 01:47:22.088]  I appreciate your call.
[01:47:22.768 --> 01:47:24.168]  Let's talk to Bryce in Texas.
[01:47:24.228 --> 01:47:25.069]  Bryce, you're on the air.
[01:47:25.089 --> 01:47:27.309]  Can you hear me?
[01:47:27.469 --> 01:47:27.969]  Yes, I can.
[01:47:27.989 --> 01:47:30.770]  Hey man, I'm glad to be talking with you today.
[01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:36.230]  I've woken up over the past year by talking with some of my friends and mostly by watching your DVDs and a few others.
[01:47:37.231 --> 01:47:39.331]  And I've got a couple questions for you.
[01:47:39.793 --> 01:47:43.995]  I wanted to know, you know, I hear your show every day and I start listening to it and really thinking about it.
[01:47:44.075 --> 01:47:47.657]  I wanted to know, what is your plan for really changing the government?
[01:47:47.797 --> 01:47:58.542]  We talk about, or you talk about, all the different things that's going on and I understand it and I believe it and I see it with my own eyes, but other than having some kind of a revolution, how are you going to change it peacefully?
[01:47:58.762 --> 01:48:04.985]  And the last question is, have you thought about running for a public office with your knowledge and everything that you know?
[01:48:05.965 --> 01:48:08.529]  I think that you could change things by doing that.
[01:48:08.869 --> 01:48:12.354]  Well, this is a very important call, Bryce.
[01:48:13.056 --> 01:48:16.420]  And I have answered this question many times, but it always needs to be reiterated.
[01:48:17.021 --> 01:48:17.802]  I am in the film.
[01:48:19.554 --> 01:48:29.523]  That is basically a video version of Richard Mack's book, where he talks about getting good sheriffs elected, getting good county commissioners, good city council, good legislatures.
[01:48:30.004 --> 01:48:33.327]  We get 60% or higher turnout for a presidential run.
[01:48:34.127 --> 01:48:38.091]  We get around, on average, 25% or so for an off-year election federally.
[01:48:38.431 --> 01:48:42.795]  And we get about a little over 8% turnout nationally in local races.
[01:48:43.676 --> 01:48:47.578]  And Travis County, where I live, it mirrors the national average, a little over 8%.
[01:48:48.939 --> 01:49:12.693]  We are so focused on the big dog and pony show of the presidential election, and so much money and time and energy gets spent on that, when it's easy for the globalists to control the Republican and Democrat frontrunners, that the media pushes in front of people and says, these are your choices, ignore all these other people in third parties, or even in the Republican or Democrat, like Ron Paul is a Republican, who would have been a much better option.
[01:49:13.553 --> 01:49:17.195]  So, A, the solution is nullification 10th Amendment.
[01:49:17.215 --> 01:49:19.656]  That's one of the solutions.
[01:49:19.876 --> 01:49:22.698]  It's also litigating for your rights and liberties.
[01:49:23.238 --> 01:49:25.019]  It's saying no to the naked body scanners.
[01:49:25.299 --> 01:49:26.980]  It's saying no to sodium fluoride in your water.
[01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:32.243]  No with the purchases you make to fluoride toothpaste or GMO food.
[01:49:32.463 --> 01:49:34.724]  That's why people won't buy GMO food now.
[01:49:34.964 --> 01:49:39.186]  So the feds are changing the rules to not say on the label that it's got GMO.
[01:49:39.466 --> 01:49:40.607]  You've got to fight for that.
[01:49:41.047 --> 01:49:44.730]  Or at least encourage companies to put their own label that they're not GMO.
[01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:46.191]  The feds have tried to block that.
[01:49:47.292 --> 01:49:56.140]  They want to not tell you on the mandatory label that it has GMO, but they're also trying to block, but they failed, letting milk companies say no hormones, no GMO hormones.
[01:49:58.655 --> 01:50:02.878]  So, you fight with your pocketbook, the votes you make with money.
[01:50:03.318 --> 01:50:07.021]  You fight with your voice, speaking out, letting others know what's happening, informing others.
[01:50:07.301 --> 01:50:13.906]  You fight by running for office yourself, even if you lose, you educate people at those forums, at those debates, at those events.
[01:50:14.426 --> 01:50:19.249]  Now, when you talk about Alex Jones running for office, it's never been about Alex Jones.
[01:50:19.549 --> 01:50:21.571]  I can't save the world individually.
[01:50:22.171 --> 01:50:22.551]  Okay?
[01:50:23.132 --> 01:50:25.614]  There's only one man that can do that, and that's Jesus Christ.
[01:50:26.525 --> 01:50:27.906]  So, I can't do that.
[01:50:27.986 --> 01:50:31.449]  But an idea, no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[01:50:31.869 --> 01:50:34.651]  And so I'm doing the best I can with a radio show.
[01:50:34.992 --> 01:50:38.955]  I mean, did you know under FCC rules I can't have a radio show if I run for political office?
[01:50:39.855 --> 01:50:40.696]  Plus, I don't want to run.
[01:50:41.276 --> 01:50:42.838]  You know the way the campaign laws are written?
[01:50:43.198 --> 01:50:46.220]  That it's impossible to run a campaign and not be put in jail if you're real?
[01:50:46.701 --> 01:50:48.842]  But then the crooks in government, they get to violate all the rules?
[01:50:51.465 --> 01:50:53.487]  All of us need to move forward against the globalists.
[01:50:53.507 --> 01:50:54.548]  They can't stop us all.
[01:50:54.808 --> 01:50:56.210]  It's easy to kill Alex Jones.
[01:50:56.490 --> 01:50:57.151]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:01.622]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:51:01.702 --> 01:51:03.663]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:51:03.783 --> 01:51:06.425]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:51:06.525 --> 01:51:08.467]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:51:08.747 --> 01:51:09.948]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:51:10.168 --> 01:51:12.049]  But first, the facts.
[01:51:12.069 --> 01:51:13.790]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:15.712]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:51:15.972 --> 01:51:19.454]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:51:19.674 --> 01:51:27.059]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:51:27.419 --> 01:51:28.020]  Sinofresh.
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:31.161]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[01:51:46.484 --> 01:51:47.624]  Call right now for $2 off per bottle.
[01:51:47.644 --> 01:51:48.004]  Mention GCN.

[01:51:48.944 --> 01:51:49.204]  It works!
[01:51:58.479 --> 01:51:59.740]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:05.126]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:05.366 --> 01:52:09.990]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:10.391 --> 01:52:10.791]  It's true.
[01:52:10.871 --> 01:52:15.436]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:15.956 --> 01:52:20.659]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:23.101]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:23.501 --> 01:52:28.104]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:28.304 --> 01:52:29.185]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:29.405 --> 01:52:32.187]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:32.487 --> 01:52:35.789]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:36.110 --> 01:52:38.951]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:39.292 --> 01:52:41.193]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:41.513 --> 01:52:42.434]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:46.076 --> 01:52:47.857]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:49.037 --> 01:52:54.820]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:55.140 --> 01:52:57.521]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:58.328 --> 01:53:01.349]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:53:01.709 --> 01:53:05.311]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:53:05.611 --> 01:53:09.073]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:53:09.333 --> 01:53:17.176]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants
[01:53:17.176 --> 01:53:17.436]  I think so.

[01:54:24.298 --> 01:54:27.380]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, about to start the third hour.
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:41.932]  At the 8 after, I will get into the cycles that society goes through and just what this decadence means and why tyrannies always enslave and kill people en masse.
[01:54:43.313 --> 01:54:46.475]  And then I'm going to open the phones up specifically, I'm going to get to these callers now.
[01:54:47.857 --> 01:55:09.553]  But future calls are for people with farms, with ranches, with land being harassed by the Animal ID, the Premises ID, folks that are concerned about this new legislation they're trying to pass to basically not let you can strawberries or do any type of preparation of food and then sell it or even give it away, which will just wipe out
[01:55:12.688 --> 01:55:12.988]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:13.028 --> 01:55:15.491]  First of all, I'd like to thank you for all that you do.
[01:55:36.807 --> 01:55:51.974]  I guess, being what you just said, I have a lot of things I could talk to you about, but right now I'm going to discuss what you... I heard what you said earlier about mad cow disease, and it sounds like you believe the government lying on the cause of mad cow disease, and I'd like to explain some things to you if I could.
[01:55:51.994 --> 01:55:54.515]  Go ahead.
[01:55:55.715 --> 01:56:06.080]  Prior to the outbreak of mad cow disease in Great Britain, the British government mandated the use of a high level of organophosphate to kill the warble flies.
[01:56:08.730 --> 01:56:13.272]  Subsequently, then the cattle came down with mad cow disease.
[01:56:13.352 --> 01:56:21.076]  Now there was a British farmer who was also a scientist who saw some abnormalities and he did some research.
[01:56:21.616 --> 01:56:28.680]  And what he found was that the cattle that did not have the organophosphate didn't come down with mad cow disease and tested negative for it.
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:31.381]  He did a lot more research and his theory
[01:56:32.873 --> 01:56:37.697]  Well, let me say this.
[01:56:37.817 --> 01:56:48.708]  I'm familiar with the large debate going on for 15 years or so about what really is causing mad cow disease, but there are a lot of studies, and it's as normal.
[01:56:48.808 --> 01:56:49.789]  I mean, it's a cocktail.
[01:56:49.809 --> 01:56:53.833]  It's like vaccines can cause a wide range of neurological disorders.
[01:56:54.294 --> 01:56:56.116]  It's the same issue with cows.
[01:56:56.696 --> 01:56:58.617]  They call it awful, as I'm sure you know.
[01:56:59.057 --> 01:57:01.678]  They take dead cows, pigs, goats, sheep.
[01:57:02.039 --> 01:57:05.140]  They grind them up in these big slurry pools.
[01:57:05.660 --> 01:57:12.483]  Then they create a protein mash and basically then mix it into regular cattle feed.
[01:57:12.804 --> 01:57:14.364]  Cows are not meant to eat meat.
[01:57:15.265 --> 01:57:16.946]  They are herbivores.
[01:57:17.766 --> 01:57:18.806]  They're not omnivores.
[01:57:18.846 --> 01:57:20.207]  They don't eat everything like a pig.
[01:57:20.507 --> 01:57:23.088]  They're not carnivores like a Bengal tiger or a lion.
[01:57:24.449 --> 01:57:27.691]  They're not omnivores like a grizzly bear that eats plants and animals.
[01:57:28.852 --> 01:57:31.734]  So, I mean, it's bad to feed.
[01:57:31.754 --> 01:57:37.478]  I mean, they've got a blood protein that they feed to calves.
[01:57:38.118 --> 01:57:39.799]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:41.460]  Cows don't eat meat.
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:43.182]  I mean, you agree with that, don't you?
[01:57:44.162 --> 01:57:47.204]  Well, let me explain a little bit.
[01:57:47.224 --> 01:57:48.005]  I'm going to ask you again.
[01:57:48.265 --> 01:57:50.847]  Do cows eat meat in the wild?
[01:57:52.501 --> 01:57:53.041]  No, they do not.
[01:57:53.121 --> 01:57:55.443]  And they do not in this country because it's been banned.
[01:57:56.564 --> 01:57:58.285]  And so they no longer do.
[01:57:58.625 --> 01:58:04.088]  And they used to, years ago, yes, within feed would be meat and bone meal.
[01:58:05.169 --> 01:58:10.392]  And they did, but they don't anymore since Mad Cow Disease.
[01:58:10.652 --> 01:58:19.798]  The whole government thing, the government caused the Mad Cow Disease outbreak in Great Britain, and they couldn't, they were not going to accept responsibility, so they had to come up with a
[01:58:25.687 --> 01:58:27.487]  Well, you may be right.
[01:58:27.547 --> 01:58:29.928]  I saw some evidence to that point.
[01:58:30.408 --> 01:58:32.889]  I was just mentioning that Oprah Winfrey talked about it.
[01:58:32.909 --> 01:58:34.450]  I think that was my issue.
[01:58:34.630 --> 01:58:35.150]  Anything else?
[01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:37.071]  Stay there.

[02:00:20.849 --> 02:00:26.371]  Alright, I've got multiple in-depth news blitzes coming up in this hour.
[02:00:26.391 --> 02:00:30.632]  I'm going to break down the cycle of human civilization briefly.
[02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:35.041]  And we're going to open the phones up after I've finished up with these calls.
[02:00:35.141 --> 02:00:37.322]  As each caller hangs up, that's your chance to call in.
[02:00:38.602 --> 02:00:42.764]  Dealing with this legislation that could pass as early as this week.
[02:00:43.244 --> 02:00:49.926]  We do have Judith McGeary, the lawyer and farm owner, is very outspoken and very well versed on this, joining us Thursday.
[02:00:51.006 --> 02:00:56.388]  She had a family emergency and could have made it today, but I just told her, no, you take care of that problem.
[02:00:57.209 --> 02:00:58.249]  But I do want to go over farm.
[02:01:00.768 --> 02:01:06.291]  Situation, headline, Farmer Consumer Outcry Helping to Stop Passage of Draconian Food Safety Bill.
[02:01:06.811 --> 02:01:13.235]  But it still has a chance of passing, but the good news is it's so draconian, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act is in trouble.
[02:01:13.715 --> 02:01:15.796]  But it'll just give you an idea of what these people are trying to do.
[02:01:16.397 --> 02:01:24.701]  But just like the Animal ID Premises ID, we stood up and fought that in the last seven years, and now it's in deep trouble, but they're coming back with it again.
[02:01:24.741 --> 02:01:27.123]  They said, OK, we're going to back off, but then they're coming back again.
[02:01:28.581 --> 02:01:34.107]  The toll-free number for farmers, ranchers, and others to call in on is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:01:34.867 --> 02:01:49.583]  Now, going back to Chris in South Dakota, who sounds like a farmer, I am familiar with all the debates about feeding meat products to cows and not cause the prions to grow in the brain.
[02:01:51.119 --> 02:01:52.179]  I don't know.
[02:02:10.925 --> 02:02:22.790]  four-foot mouth using the same equipment they just used to kill millions of cows and sheep but that got stopped and so yes I don't always trust their official stories I was just as an aside mentioning
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:33.506]  That I don't like Oprah Winfrey and her world government promotion, but I said I guess you could say she did some good when she tried to, you know, at least talk about Mad Cow.
[02:02:34.046 --> 02:02:35.767]  So that was just a side footnote.
[02:02:35.787 --> 02:02:37.869]  I was just trying to be totally judgmental about her.
[02:02:38.169 --> 02:02:43.432]  Didn't mean to cause a whole discussion about this, but go ahead and finish your points, Chris.
[02:02:44.313 --> 02:02:52.538]  Well, I was probably pretty well finished on that, but we do rant in South Dakota, my wife and I and family, and I've been
[02:02:53.826 --> 02:02:57.552]  Very involved in the fight against NAIS for four years now.
[02:02:57.932 --> 02:03:00.236]  And actually, I know Judith McGeary personally.
[02:03:01.057 --> 02:03:04.162]  And you're right, they've renamed it.
[02:03:04.182 --> 02:03:06.145]  It's now called Animal Disease Traceability.
[02:03:06.707 --> 02:03:10.690]  They're going to try to continue to do it, and we need to continue to fight it.
[02:03:12.211 --> 02:03:18.855]  I mean, the news says we're not doing it, but then the bureaucrats still show up on record and say, you're going to do this or you're going to get arrested.
[02:03:18.875 --> 02:03:20.436]  But they also run stunts.
[02:03:20.536 --> 02:03:23.238]  I've seen this in all major agriculture states.
[02:03:23.818 --> 02:03:28.601]  They will, on purpose, as a stunt, normally do it to a girl because they like her to cry.
[02:03:28.861 --> 02:03:29.502]  They'll give her the...
[02:03:30.442 --> 02:03:40.746]  The Blue Ribbon for the best calf, or the Blue Ribbon for the best pig, the best hog, and then give it to her on stage, and then say, wait a minute, wait a minute, we got something going on here.
[02:03:40.766 --> 02:03:47.448]  Now this shows how diabolical they are, and they'll have a cop come up and say, you're not allowed to have that.
[02:03:47.848 --> 02:03:50.449]  Your family farm is an animal ID, which isn't even a law.
[02:03:51.434 --> 02:03:56.038]  And she will cry and they throw her out and all the other families rush out and register.
[02:03:56.278 --> 02:04:01.281]  So to be part of the school lag, to be part of the fair, they say you've got to do this.
[02:04:01.682 --> 02:04:03.183]  I mean, is that not diabolical?
[02:04:04.264 --> 02:04:04.844]  Well, it is.
[02:04:04.924 --> 02:04:06.285]  And it's just one example.
[02:04:06.325 --> 02:04:11.209]  I mean, in Colorado, they forced everybody at the state fair to register their premises.
[02:04:12.089 --> 02:04:14.031]  And who's going to tell their kid not to?
[02:04:14.671 --> 02:04:18.134]  Now, there were two families that refused because they knew what it was going to do to their property.
[02:04:19.201 --> 02:04:20.942]  But that's the kind of thing they do all along.
[02:04:20.962 --> 02:04:30.705]  You know, in 2006... Oh yeah, you waive your rights, you waive your Fourth Amendment, and now the game warden, instead of harassing you, is now going to be on your property about what you're growing.
[02:04:31.045 --> 02:04:31.525]  Anything else?
[02:04:33.006 --> 02:04:33.806]  Uh, no, that'd be it.
[02:04:34.266 --> 02:04:34.867]  Alright, well listen.
[02:04:35.247 --> 02:04:36.607]  I'm getting into this subject now.
[02:04:37.508 --> 02:04:40.289]  I want you as a farmer to add anything else or rancher.
[02:04:41.229 --> 02:04:42.389]  Is there anything else you want to add?
[02:04:43.570 --> 02:04:46.711]  Well, just that there's... I guess it would be this.
[02:04:47.611 --> 02:04:50.033]  They vertically integrated the... Stay there!
[02:04:50.133 --> 02:04:50.514]  Stay there!

[02:06:57.418 --> 02:07:01.641]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:01.961 --> 02:07:02.561]  Number 1.
[02:07:02.881 --> 02:07:06.023]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:06.304 --> 02:07:06.864]  Number 2.
[02:07:07.164 --> 02:07:11.707]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:12.047 --> 02:07:12.508]  It's true.
[02:07:12.808 --> 02:07:17.371]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:17.671 --> 02:07:18.211]  Number 3.
[02:07:18.491 --> 02:07:21.773]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:22.074 --> 02:07:25.776]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:25.976 --> 02:07:26.537]  Number 4.
[02:07:26.777 --> 02:07:29.139]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:32.923]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:33.224 --> 02:07:33.764]  Number 5.
[02:07:34.024 --> 02:07:37.949]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:38.169 --> 02:07:42.934]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:43.214 --> 02:07:47.238]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:47.378 --> 02:07:48.939]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:07:54.044 --> 02:08:04.794]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:08:05.695 --> 02:08:06.876]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:12.762 --> 02:08:18.706]  Chris is a rancher in South Dakota, and I'm well-read on all these subjects.
[02:08:18.726 --> 02:08:21.308]  What he's saying is spot-on from my research.
[02:08:22.228 --> 02:08:24.390]  He was trying to talk about the vertical integration.
[02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:28.673]  That's technical jargon for getting rid of family farms and ranches.
[02:08:29.113 --> 02:08:42.502]  The IRS is now harassing farms and ranches, saying if you're not profitable, you're not even eligible to get small tax deductions, then the states are trying to mirror that and trying to pull people's
[02:08:43.022 --> 02:08:43.222]  I don't
[02:09:02.992 --> 02:09:15.629]  They've got family farms down to two acres now in many areas, and now they're saying, we're passing zoning countywide, you gotta pay a $5,000 a year fee just to grow tomatoes in your backyard.
[02:09:15.689 --> 02:09:16.751]  I mean, it's really happening.
[02:09:18.775 --> 02:09:22.938]  And it is so hardcore what they're doing.
[02:09:23.538 --> 02:09:26.460]  So finish up your points, Chris, because you got interrupted by the break.
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:29.741]  Then we're going to rush through these next few calls.
[02:09:30.142 --> 02:09:34.304]  Then I'm going to get into the cycle we go through briefly.
[02:09:34.344 --> 02:09:37.626]  And then we're going to go to farmers in Arkansas and other states.
[02:09:38.226 --> 02:09:38.887]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:09:39.447 --> 02:09:40.948]  Well, thanks, Alex, for keeping me on.
[02:09:40.988 --> 02:09:42.429]  And I'll try to be quick.
[02:09:43.309 --> 02:09:46.671]  They have almost complete control of the poultry, hog, dairy, sheep.
[02:09:48.268 --> 02:10:02.692]  industries the the cattle industry is the largest segment of the agriculture in the United States and they're doing their darndest to get control of us and through NAIS, the food safety bill, the pressure on the people that have the grazing permits and federal lands.
[02:10:03.912 --> 02:10:09.874]  When they get complete control of the food supply in this country is when they can take over.
[02:10:10.374 --> 02:10:13.875]  What I have said for a long time is that people will
[02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:20.365]  Give up their guns, they will give up, take shots, they will do anything for a loaf of bread for their kids.
[02:10:21.125 --> 02:10:33.116]  And what consumers in this country need to know is that they need to help us fight our fights in these industries, in these ag industries, because if they don't, we're so far outnumbered.
[02:10:33.136 --> 02:10:39.221]  There's less than 2% of the American people are in the country raising grain and cattle and hogs.
[02:10:40.714 --> 02:10:45.279]  The consumers need to get behind us, or else we're all going to go hungry, and we're all going to be in trouble.
[02:10:45.659 --> 02:10:47.281]  Well, God bless you, Chris.
[02:10:47.321 --> 02:10:50.805]  What you're doing is a duty to the Republic.
[02:10:50.845 --> 02:11:02.637]  Thomas Jefferson, 200-plus years ago, this was the most common thing he wrote about, that we needed country gentlemen who were educated, armed,
[02:11:03.678 --> 02:11:21.668]  with firearms and armed with the truth and if we ever became a centralized society Europe only had about 10% urban then and he talked about how that was being used to control people and how they formed paramilitary forces in the cities to go out and basically turn
[02:11:22.768 --> 02:11:25.009]  the farming communities in Europe into serfs.
[02:11:25.509 --> 02:11:31.172]  And so the same battle they were fighting 200 plus years ago, we're now fighting today, and God bless you, keep it up.
[02:11:31.652 --> 02:11:34.873]  For those that don't know, the numbers he just gave you are the precise numbers.
[02:11:35.333 --> 02:11:36.634]  You can pull these up if you'd like.
[02:11:37.074 --> 02:11:42.136]  Just search the term, you know, number of Americans that are urban dwellers.
[02:11:42.876 --> 02:11:43.897]  It's right at 90% are urban.
[02:11:48.686 --> 02:11:53.929]  90% live in cities or suburbs and are not self-sufficient in any way.
[02:11:54.750 --> 02:11:57.451]  They don't grow one tomato a year out on the back porch.
[02:11:59.273 --> 02:12:16.144]  Of the 10%, roughly, that are rural, most of them work at the hardware store, or the Walmart, or the prison, or the power plant, or the mine, or at, you know, trimming yards, or at the veterinary clinic, whatever the case may be.
[02:12:17.369 --> 02:12:19.631]  Or at the floral shop, whatever's in the little town.
[02:12:20.011 --> 02:12:21.952]  Or at the dry goods shop, or the gun shop.
[02:12:22.573 --> 02:12:25.515]  Now most of those people love their family land.
[02:12:26.255 --> 02:12:34.761]  Almost all of them, if you do the study or just travel to a small town, their families, this is the same for England, Canada, France, it doesn't matter.
[02:12:35.702 --> 02:12:37.043]  And they're under attack everywhere.
[02:12:38.035 --> 02:12:45.198]  And when you study these areas, they all, most of them, have their own little plot of vegetables.
[02:12:45.738 --> 02:12:51.780]  They may can a little bit of it for friends and family, almost as a ritual to keep the culture alive.
[02:12:52.241 --> 02:13:00.624]  They may go out four or five days a year, park on the side of the road, sell jams, sell carrots, sell tomatoes, sell watermelons, whatever the case is.
[02:13:00.664 --> 02:13:01.504]  You see it out there.
[02:13:02.064 --> 02:13:05.586]  Sell pecans, sell plums, sell apples.
[02:13:06.346 --> 02:13:08.007]  It's all over under this bill.
[02:13:09.749 --> 02:13:17.155]  If there is any preparation, if you slice those peaches and put them in a can, you can't do it.
[02:13:17.955 --> 02:13:30.025]  And the way the legislation reads, and I've gone over this, Judah's coming on Thursday to talk more about it, that it also reads that there are inspections and fines and fees if you're growing anything for sale.
[02:13:31.209 --> 02:13:38.090]  Now, this is another way to shut down the farms and ranches and make you pay through those fines and fees for more bureaucrats.
[02:13:38.130 --> 02:13:43.672]  Now listen, my family has been in Freestone County on my dad's side since 1829 on multiple sides.
[02:13:44.512 --> 02:13:47.492]  First big wave that came in, we have Mexican land grants.
[02:13:48.092 --> 02:13:55.114]  We've got copies of it in the old family Bible falling apart, where we bought for three cents an acre from the Mexican government.
[02:13:56.174 --> 02:14:00.455]  Now, we have a tiny piece of that property left compared to what we had.
[02:14:01.357 --> 02:14:01.697]  Okay?
[02:14:02.658 --> 02:14:06.520]  And they want to get rid of that.
[02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:10.522]  They want to drive people off of that land.
[02:14:11.003 --> 02:14:15.585]  And let me tell you, it's such a police state in Freestone County that I am an amateur astronomer.
[02:14:16.166 --> 02:14:28.353]  And back in college, when I had more time, I would, whenever I'd go visit my grandma, or I'd go out to East Texas, I'd take the telescope and I'd set it up in the front yard or I'd go out in the, you know, in the 200 acres that's in front of their house.
[02:14:29.213 --> 02:14:42.718]  Out there with the cows, and I'd set it up, and every time I did it, the gate would get opened, they'd drive onto our property, they'd shine lights in my face, and they'd say, I wanna see if you got guns, are you out here hunting?
[02:14:43.278 --> 02:14:44.419]  This isn't a free country.
[02:14:44.899 --> 02:14:53.742]  You can have the illegal alien Barack Obama's aunt on TV saying, I came here illegally, I'm on three forms of welfare, and I deserve it.
[02:14:54.082 --> 02:14:55.502]  And the police aren't gonna touch her.
[02:14:56.443 --> 02:14:56.623]  But,
[02:14:59.321 --> 02:15:01.383]  I don't even, and I shouldn't let them win.
[02:15:02.684 --> 02:15:15.676]  A, I'm too busy to go hunting, but B, every time I'm at our little deer camp, about six acres into our own property, we don't even have hunters on our land.
[02:15:16.917 --> 02:15:17.858]  When I was a kid, they did.
[02:15:17.878 --> 02:15:20.280]  You know, people that paid a lease it.
[02:15:22.462 --> 02:15:23.844]  Every time I go hunting,
[02:15:25.031 --> 02:15:33.878]  The gate opens up, lights drive up, and arrogant, bloated pieces of trash game wardens come up, and you'll have a deer hanging up.
[02:15:33.918 --> 02:15:35.299]  They don't care if you got the sticker.
[02:15:35.519 --> 02:15:36.740]  They don't care if you have the tags.
[02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:38.381]  They let you know you're scum.
[02:15:39.122 --> 02:15:40.743]  Now, when I was a child, it wasn't like that.
[02:15:41.224 --> 02:15:42.304]  And it's like that everywhere.
[02:15:42.365 --> 02:15:43.966]  This isn't land of the free, home of the brave.
[02:15:44.246 --> 02:15:45.887]  They're not looking for poachers, folks.
[02:15:46.127 --> 02:15:47.929]  They're there to let you know you're their slave.
[02:15:48.209 --> 02:15:54.054]  And now they're training them to see what you're growing, to see what you're doing, and claiming they don't need warrants to come on your property.
[02:15:54.554 --> 02:15:57.376]  And this goes back to Robin Hood 800 years ago.
[02:15:57.977 --> 02:16:05.223]  This goes back to your family starving, you get caught with a rabbit you killed to feed your wife, and they would kill you.
[02:16:06.184 --> 02:16:07.145]  They would kill you.
[02:16:07.645 --> 02:16:11.729]  They would take you out, tie you to a pole, and slit your throat was the main way they did it.
[02:16:12.109 --> 02:16:13.771]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[02:16:14.511 --> 02:16:15.712]  And that's how this works.
[02:16:18.479 --> 02:16:19.560]  I don't even want to be around him.
[02:16:19.860 --> 02:16:20.661]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:16:21.021 --> 02:16:23.764]  Three years ago, my great-uncle since died of pancreatic cancer.
[02:16:24.224 --> 02:16:28.148]  He had been radiated, had part of his pancreas removed.
[02:16:28.748 --> 02:16:30.510]  He wanted to go hunting one more time.
[02:16:31.310 --> 02:16:32.251]  He thought he was going to die then.
[02:16:32.291 --> 02:16:33.673]  He ended up dying last year.
[02:16:34.313 --> 02:16:35.114]  My Uncle Leonard.
[02:16:35.935 --> 02:16:36.515]  Leonard Jones.
[02:16:36.555 --> 02:16:36.995]  Great guy.
[02:16:38.457 --> 02:16:39.458]  He is out there.
[02:16:41.136 --> 02:16:45.601]  And I always love these reports, like the cop broke the neck of this 84-year-old vet and they're like, he's a vet.
[02:16:45.982 --> 02:16:47.564]  Well, you know, they hate vets even more.
[02:16:48.044 --> 02:16:50.707]  But a Korean vet, you know, great guy.
[02:16:51.788 --> 02:16:55.873]  He was sick and didn't want to drive the deer in to have it processed.
[02:16:55.893 --> 02:16:57.275]  He didn't want to have to gut it himself.
[02:16:58.176 --> 02:16:58.936]  So my uncle
[02:17:00.296 --> 02:17:06.759]  And my dad got in the car to drive it into town, a county that my family literally founded.
[02:17:06.959 --> 02:17:08.019]  You understand, this is America.
[02:17:08.660 --> 02:17:10.760]  They're driving into Fairfield, 10 miles away.
[02:17:12.081 --> 02:17:13.422]  Our property's closer to Buffalo.
[02:17:15.162 --> 02:17:23.266]  They drive in there, and we... I wasn't there, my dad told me the story, my uncle.
[02:17:24.206 --> 02:17:25.667]  And the state police pull him over.
[02:17:26.707 --> 02:17:36.113]  And this guy got his hand on his gun, he's yelling at my uncle, and the deer has a tag on it, and he says, what do you mean you didn't kill this deer?
[02:17:36.133 --> 02:17:37.053]  You're going to jail.
[02:17:37.113 --> 02:17:38.274]  All these other state police show up.
[02:17:38.474 --> 02:17:41.456]  You're not allowed to transport a deer that wasn't yours.
[02:17:42.036 --> 02:17:45.118]  And they said, well, actually, I'm a landowner, and it's legal for a landowner to do it.
[02:17:45.138 --> 02:17:46.119]  And they said, shut up!
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:47.900]  Shut up!
[02:17:50.347 --> 02:17:51.527]  I didn't, I wasn't talking to you.
[02:17:51.547 --> 02:17:56.069]  You know that routine where you're talking to somebody and you talk and they tell you, be quiet, shut up.
[02:17:56.689 --> 02:17:57.850]  And then more police show up.
[02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:59.290]  One actually had an IQ.
[02:17:59.630 --> 02:18:01.511]  I guess he didn't drink enough fluoride when he was growing up.
[02:18:01.531 --> 02:18:03.192]  He says, no, it's, it's legal.
[02:18:03.552 --> 02:18:04.912]  And that cop was like, you're lucky.
[02:18:04.952 --> 02:18:05.933]  I'll get you next time.
[02:18:07.553 --> 02:18:09.894]  I mean, this is what our country has turned into.
[02:18:09.954 --> 02:18:11.455]  This is what our country is.
[02:18:11.535 --> 02:18:15.076]  The government wants you to know that you're a slave.
[02:18:17.401 --> 02:18:21.263]  They want you to know that you're being watched.
[02:18:22.744 --> 02:18:26.967]  That's why they have that Pennsylvania TV ad where it says, Tom, nice house, nice car.
[02:18:26.987 --> 02:18:29.948]  What's not nice is you owe $4,000 in back taxes.
[02:18:29.968 --> 02:18:31.629]  And it shows a satellite watching Tom.
[02:18:32.310 --> 02:18:34.211]  They want you to know they're watching you.
[02:18:34.251 --> 02:18:35.412]  They want you to know.
[02:18:35.772 --> 02:18:37.973]  And they're going to put you in jail with a million dollar fine.
[02:18:38.353 --> 02:18:39.814]  That's the AP headline.
[02:18:41.295 --> 02:18:43.456]  In fact, a million dollar fine for garage sale.
[02:18:43.476 --> 02:18:44.017]  Search that term.
[02:18:45.077 --> 02:18:49.919]  I want to show folks, they want you to know that you are scum.
[02:18:50.919 --> 02:18:56.881]  Now the illegal aliens filling up the military, driving down the wages, voting to take your guns, they're above the law.
[02:18:57.581 --> 02:19:01.502]  I saw another case last week in Austin where this illegal alien had run into people three times.
[02:19:01.522 --> 02:19:05.844]  He finally killed somebody and they're not even knowing if they're going to charge him with manslaughter.
[02:19:07.605 --> 02:19:10.708]  Because you don't want to make them not feel welcome.
[02:19:11.248 --> 02:19:12.369]  They're red carpet.
[02:19:12.410 --> 02:19:18.095]  That's why Obama's aunt, she says, hey, you owe me three forms of welfare.
[02:19:18.575 --> 02:19:19.376]  I'm an illegal alien.
[02:19:19.416 --> 02:19:20.477]  You owe me citizenship.
[02:19:20.537 --> 02:19:21.318]  Give me the money.
[02:19:22.219 --> 02:19:23.840]  Give me that money right now.
[02:19:24.901 --> 02:19:27.804]  But when they're done bringing this country down, you think she's going to get anything?
[02:19:27.844 --> 02:19:28.685]  No, she's going to get nothing.
[02:19:29.790 --> 02:19:31.911]  But see, all these debts that are run up are to the bankers.
[02:19:31.971 --> 02:19:33.052]  So citizens, there it is.
[02:19:33.072 --> 02:19:36.614]  New government policy imposes strict standards on garage sales nationwide.
[02:19:37.835 --> 02:19:39.475]  And it, uh, I'm sorry.
[02:19:39.756 --> 02:19:40.296]  I was wrong.
[02:19:40.316 --> 02:19:41.457]  I was doing that from a year ago.
[02:19:41.497 --> 02:19:42.557]  I said one million fine.
[02:19:42.917 --> 02:19:43.778]  I apologize.
[02:19:43.838 --> 02:19:44.558]  I got it wrong.
[02:19:45.499 --> 02:19:46.680]  You thought I was exaggerating?
[02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:47.260]  I'm sorry.
[02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:50.462]  No, it was fifteen million dollar fine.
[02:19:50.522 --> 02:19:51.022]  Excuse me.
[02:19:52.343 --> 02:19:56.205]  A fifteen million dollar federal fine for a garage sale.
[02:19:57.125 --> 02:19:57.746]  We'll be right back.

[02:21:57.987 --> 02:22:02.830]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:22:02.930 --> 02:22:03.711]  What have we got?
[02:22:03.931 --> 02:22:06.072]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:22:06.392 --> 02:22:07.133]  A republic.
[02:22:07.393 --> 02:22:09.734]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:22:09.814 --> 02:22:11.956]  It's not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:22:12.296 --> 02:22:14.217]  Two wolves in a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:22:14.337 --> 02:22:15.598]  So they think they own our land?
[02:22:16.018 --> 02:22:17.139]  They think they own our water?
[02:22:17.339 --> 02:22:17.739]  Children?
[02:22:17.939 --> 02:22:18.720]  Our education?
[02:22:19.060 --> 02:22:19.680]  Our money?
[02:22:19.881 --> 02:22:23.543]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:22:23.903 --> 02:22:27.568]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:22:27.608 --> 02:22:28.570]  You're being warned.
[02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:29.711]  We have the facts.
[02:22:29.891 --> 02:22:31.013]  We have the Constitution.
[02:22:31.073 --> 02:22:31.934]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:22:31.974 --> 02:22:32.795]  We have common law.
[02:22:32.855 --> 02:22:35.118]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:22:39.264 --> 02:22:44.047]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:22:44.208 --> 02:22:45.588]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:22:45.709 --> 02:22:46.549]  Don't tread on me.

[02:24:04.352 --> 02:24:04.874]  Yeah.
[02:24:31.405 --> 02:24:33.827]  Okay, I want to take some calls from farmers.
[02:24:33.907 --> 02:24:35.588]  I will spend five minutes on the cycle.
[02:24:35.608 --> 02:24:38.610]  I'm going to make a YouTube or PrisonPlanet.TV video.
[02:24:38.970 --> 02:24:43.413]  I made a 30-minute special video for PrisonPlanet.TV members that went up last night.
[02:24:44.194 --> 02:24:48.276]  It's titled, What We Really Are, where I talk about the nature of humanity.
[02:24:48.316 --> 02:24:49.417]  It deals with the cycle.
[02:24:49.857 --> 02:24:51.118]  It deals with all these issues.
[02:24:51.518 --> 02:24:53.880]  But I wanted to get into some other facets of it, and we will.
[02:24:54.340 --> 02:24:59.124]  But let's go to some farmer calls, then we'll get to Brian and JD.
[02:24:59.924 --> 02:25:09.150]  For farmers to call in and talk about what they're dealing with, or ranchers, and this legislation that is designed to shut down what's left of the family farm and ranch.
[02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:11.331]  Scott in Arkansas, you're on the air.
[02:25:12.172 --> 02:25:13.373]  Hi Alex, how you doing?
[02:25:13.393 --> 02:25:13.653]  Good.
[02:25:14.553 --> 02:25:21.358]  Here just about a year ago, we bought some heirloom organic seed vault, and we planted about a half an acre this year.
[02:25:22.276 --> 02:25:30.793]  Well, about the beginning of August, we had some Mexican citizens, I guess, here on work visas with spray containers on their backpacks.
[02:25:31.656 --> 02:25:35.099]  Spraying everybody's land around here, including our gardens.
[02:25:35.199 --> 02:25:35.479]  Yeah, I know.
[02:25:35.559 --> 02:25:36.380]  I knew where you were going.
[02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:39.582]  Let me tell you what's happening there, at least with cases I've seen.
[02:25:40.002 --> 02:25:45.106]  Monsanto, and how they get away with trespassing, I don't know, actually has planes.
[02:25:45.166 --> 02:25:46.107]  In fact, search this.
[02:25:46.147 --> 02:25:46.847]  People won't believe it.
[02:25:47.428 --> 02:25:50.410]  Monsanto drops roundup bombs on crops.
[02:25:50.890 --> 02:25:58.436]  They do it in Europe, Canada, and here, all over the world, India, and they fly in with planes and drop a canister and
[02:25:59.696 --> 02:26:04.279]  Let's say it kills 300 of your corn plants, your soybean, whatever it is.
[02:26:05.020 --> 02:26:11.004]  If one plant lives, they then sue you, claiming that you had their genetics.
[02:26:11.044 --> 02:26:22.851]  But what happens is, and they finally lost in court on this, their seeds blow in, their seeds contaminate yours, and so if there's any of their genetics, that plant lives, and the Roundup doesn't kill it.
[02:26:23.111 --> 02:26:26.233]  So they're killing your crops, but the government says that's okay to test.
[02:26:26.774 --> 02:26:28.255]  Now, is that what was happening with the illegals?
[02:26:29.486 --> 02:26:45.257]  I don't know, I'm not sure, but it was a company called Progressive Solutions, contracted by Carroll Electric Corporation, and they basically came in and sprayed Lineage Clear Stand, Cordex RT, Tordon K, and Allagare 90.
[02:26:46.037 --> 02:26:51.401]  And clearly in the MSDS it says, do not spray around anywhere where there's water wells.
[02:26:51.441 --> 02:26:59.106]  And what's funny is just four to five, maybe even a week after they sprayed, everybody in our little farming community got sick.
[02:26:59.639 --> 02:27:03.484]  Well, me and my wife started driving around to look at some of the other farms that were hit.
[02:27:03.905 --> 02:27:06.128]  Not one single Cargill farm was hit.
[02:27:06.749 --> 02:27:07.290]  Not one.
[02:27:08.291 --> 02:27:08.712]  Not one.
[02:27:09.393 --> 02:27:13.719]  All the little mom-and-pop farms around here in our community, gardens are dead.
[02:27:14.370 --> 02:27:18.355]  And according to the MSDS's on Lineage Clearstand, it stays in the soil 50 feet.
[02:27:18.455 --> 02:27:19.516]  Well let me ask you a question.
[02:27:19.576 --> 02:27:26.084]  I know this is going on and it's part of basically, you know, this larger plan to shut everything down.
[02:27:26.664 --> 02:27:31.230]  Why don't you post no trespassing and why don't you call the sheriff on this company?
[02:27:32.028 --> 02:27:32.368]  We did.
[02:27:32.388 --> 02:27:41.371]  They said that the electric company owns the land near or around the power lines, which, of course, where's land at that there's no power lines?
[02:27:41.671 --> 02:27:45.192]  So they claim they have an access right-of-way that supersedes your property.
[02:27:45.232 --> 02:27:45.892]  That's made up.
[02:27:45.952 --> 02:27:46.632]  That's not true.
[02:27:47.072 --> 02:27:50.133]  They may have it right underneath it, but they're just claiming that.
[02:27:51.254 --> 02:27:51.914]  Well, they got it.
[02:27:52.634 --> 02:27:53.214]  They got us.
[02:27:53.254 --> 02:27:58.896]  They got all the other farmers in our community, and it's happened everywhere Carroll Electric has power lines, except
[02:27:59.537 --> 02:28:04.942]  These big agribusinesses, the chicken places, nothing there got sprayed.
[02:28:05.683 --> 02:28:13.451]  Which, actually, we are the home of the Tyson Chicken, right here in Northwest Arkansas, and none of their farms got sprayed.
[02:28:13.911 --> 02:28:15.853]  None of the Cargill farms got sprayed.
[02:28:15.893 --> 02:28:17.235]  They just ignored all that.
[02:28:17.788 --> 02:28:21.991]  But they hit every single mom-and-pop farm in this whole area.
[02:28:22.011 --> 02:28:22.752]  Well, they train you.
[02:28:22.772 --> 02:28:25.154]  They just come on your property, they drop bombs on it.
[02:28:26.255 --> 02:28:33.681]  Guys, I know you found an Infowars article dealing with how they're using Blackwater, but I mean, this was all over the news.
[02:28:33.841 --> 02:28:35.642]  It happened to Percy Schmeiser and many others.
[02:28:36.283 --> 02:28:40.786]  Just search the term... Well, I mean, that should pull it up.
[02:28:40.846 --> 02:28:42.127]  Or Cole Watson, if you can't find it.
[02:28:43.669 --> 02:28:44.649]  The search term would be...
[02:28:48.962 --> 02:28:52.865]  Monsanto trespasses to test for their genes.
[02:28:53.145 --> 02:28:53.865]  Something like that.
[02:28:54.446 --> 02:28:55.406]  I should pull it up for you.
[02:28:55.426 --> 02:28:59.969]  But they have planes that fly over and drop canisters that kills your crop.
[02:29:00.009 --> 02:29:01.990]  They go, oh, their crop's dead.
[02:29:02.050 --> 02:29:03.091]  They didn't steal from us.
[02:29:03.531 --> 02:29:05.513]  Meanwhile, they release their genetic material.
[02:29:05.593 --> 02:29:06.653]  It gets into your farm.
[02:29:07.014 --> 02:29:09.755]  And the courts almost always rule for them, saying that's OK.
[02:29:10.396 --> 02:29:11.276]  This is globalism.
[02:29:11.877 --> 02:29:12.357]  Incredible.
[02:29:12.397 --> 02:29:14.398]  Anything else you want to add there, Mike, from
[02:29:15.439 --> 02:29:17.802]  Flying around doing all this, we're looking for pot plants.
[02:29:18.122 --> 02:29:19.244]  Spraying for pot plants.
[02:29:19.564 --> 02:29:20.745]  Okay, Scott, sorry.
[02:29:21.186 --> 02:29:22.988]  Alright, Scott, I appreciate your call.
[02:29:23.228 --> 02:29:24.850]  I mean, did they say any other reason they were doing this?
[02:29:25.972 --> 02:29:28.495]  Uh, they said for vegetation control.
[02:29:30.077 --> 02:29:32.299]  But then they walk up to your crops and do this?
[02:29:32.780 --> 02:29:32.980]  Yes.
[02:29:34.121 --> 02:29:35.323]  But all our neighbors...
[02:29:37.375 --> 02:29:37.795]  Amazing.
[02:29:38.216 --> 02:29:39.736]  Alright, thank you so much, Scott.
[02:29:39.756 --> 02:29:43.719]  We'll go to Mike, Kathy, and many others on the other side discussing this.
[02:29:44.119 --> 02:29:45.460]  The war against agriculture.
[02:29:48.682 --> 02:29:49.582]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.063 --> 02:29:51.664]  The empire's on the run.

[02:32:59.397 --> 02:33:04.945]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:05.426 --> 02:33:07.970]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:09.506 --> 02:33:13.407]  Okay, I want to tell you about a few sponsors, and I'm going to hurry to Scott, Mike, Brian, and J.D.
[02:33:13.447 --> 02:33:14.468]  That'll be it for calls.
[02:33:14.968 --> 02:33:20.870]  I've got some more news I need to hit in this hour, and I want to get into, you know, the decadence cycle.
[02:33:21.210 --> 02:33:25.191]  We talk a lot about this, but I want people to realize what it really means.
[02:33:25.211 --> 02:33:26.251]  This is 100% in history.
[02:33:26.892 --> 02:33:29.152]  So, we know history, we can avert it.
[02:33:29.532 --> 02:33:30.973]  Or at least after the collapse,
[02:33:32.298 --> 02:33:32.458]  We're
[02:33:53.148 --> 02:33:54.589]  They're all made right here in this country.
[02:33:54.649 --> 02:33:57.411]  They have a special way they sew them so they last a lot longer.
[02:33:57.711 --> 02:34:01.634]  They don't tear out in the crotch like happens with Levi's that are now made in Mexico.
[02:34:02.175 --> 02:34:13.183]  And they've got a special running until supplies end where you can get one of two t-shirts that are gorgeous free when you order two pairs of jeans and free shipping.
[02:34:14.042 --> 02:34:15.563]  That is a giant value.
[02:34:15.583 --> 02:34:17.224]  That's got to be like a $35 value.
[02:34:17.404 --> 02:34:21.127]  Because the shirt's $24, and then the shipping normally would be about $10, I would guess.
[02:34:21.587 --> 02:34:24.369]  So, here's one of the shirts you can get free.
[02:34:25.130 --> 02:34:27.111]  It's got the Don't Tread On Me snake.
[02:34:27.151 --> 02:34:28.872]  It says Diamond Gusset with a motorcycle.
[02:34:29.292 --> 02:34:30.733]  Defender, Don't Tread On Me.
[02:34:31.194 --> 02:34:33.455]  Get that shirt free, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:34.096 --> 02:34:35.437]  You can also get free shipping.
[02:34:35.457 --> 02:34:36.617]  888-8GUSSETT.
[02:34:36.637 --> 02:34:37.038]  888-8GUSSETT.

[02:34:47.770 --> 02:34:54.177]  And one other sponsor that I want to tell you about is Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:34:55.379 --> 02:34:57.981]  A fantastic company that's been supporting us for years.
[02:34:58.021 --> 02:35:02.203]  They've been providing products that give you the perfect solution to keeping your body healthy.

[02:35:12.590 --> 02:35:18.957]  The Health Ranger in 2009 tried their NutriCafe Amazing Organic Coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:35:19.397 --> 02:35:21.479]  Now that's something you don't see on store shelves every day.

[02:35:25.102 --> 02:35:25.343]  That's 866-762-9238.

[02:35:44.133 --> 02:35:45.893]  Okay, let's hurry through your calls now.
[02:35:46.614 --> 02:35:47.914]  Mike in Texas, who's a farmer?
[02:35:47.954 --> 02:35:48.334]  Go ahead.
[02:35:53.316 --> 02:35:54.616]  I can hear Mike talking in the background.
[02:35:54.676 --> 02:35:56.317]  Let's go to Kathy and see if Mike comes back.
[02:35:56.617 --> 02:35:58.058]  Kathy in Canada, rancher.
[02:35:58.138 --> 02:35:58.658]  You're on the air.
[02:35:59.295 --> 02:36:06.477]  Hi Alex, earlier you mentioned that Oprah Winfrey did a good job bringing up the Mad Cow issue and I just want to speak to that and one other issue.
[02:36:07.777 --> 02:36:14.059]  Basically I've been helping a gentleman from the United Kingdom work on Mad Cow stuff for seven years and he passed away in 2006.
[02:36:14.279 --> 02:36:24.422]  His name was Mark Purdy, P-U-R-D-E-Y, and if I want anything from your listeners and yourself is I want you to read the book he wrote before he died.
[02:36:25.134 --> 02:36:29.396]  The book is entitled Animal Farm, and the farm is spelled P-H-A-R-M.
[02:36:29.956 --> 02:36:39.341]  And if you care about the family farm and you care about straightening out this whole fiasco with the scam that is BSE and mad cow disease, I would encourage you to read that book.
[02:36:39.361 --> 02:36:47.945]  Well, ma'am, I didn't mean to cause a big, long... I was talking about Oprah Winfrey saying she set up some weird U.N.
[02:36:47.965 --> 02:36:49.026]  global government church.
[02:36:49.446 --> 02:36:50.627]  She supported Obama.
[02:36:51.607 --> 02:36:52.468]  She's a globalist.
[02:36:53.548 --> 02:36:59.131]  And then I said, but I guess she meant to do well talking about Mad Cow and got in some trouble.
[02:36:59.652 --> 02:37:01.573]  So that was just a small footnote.
[02:37:01.713 --> 02:37:04.995]  I know that there's a lot of debate about what really causes Mad Cow.
[02:37:06.176 --> 02:37:09.698]  And whether she meant to do this or not is so much the issue.
[02:37:10.786 --> 02:37:20.190]  The situation that took place in the UK was an action by government slipping in toxins into a chemical that was used at that time on the cattle.
[02:37:20.251 --> 02:37:20.691]  Who knows?
[02:37:21.271 --> 02:37:23.352]  What about Monsanto up in Canada?
[02:37:23.392 --> 02:37:33.877]  We've had the farmers on, it's been on the news there, where Monsanto comes on your crops and sprays them with Roundup, a trespass, kill your crops to see if one plant is theirs.
[02:37:34.417 --> 02:37:36.058]  I haven't seen that around here.
[02:37:36.298 --> 02:37:38.379]  We're cattle farmers, we don't have a lot of crop plants.
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:55.934]  So what has happened in Alberta, Canada, and if you want to ask who is my government, I would say my government is a bunch of people sitting in the legislature that are owned by Monsanto, and owned by all these large corporations, because they have been passing legislation in this province at a rate that is unheard of in the last five years.
[02:37:56.494 --> 02:38:05.482]  And the legislation is being done to control the land, to control the water, and the best example is the Alberta Land Stewardship Act, which passed a couple years ago,
[02:38:05.979 --> 02:38:23.491]  Now, I have some excerpts from this act which demonstrate that the government believes that they can take actions that, I'm going to quote here, establishing, supporting, or facilitating funding and cost-sharing initiatives, mechanisms, and instruments to support or enhance any or any one or more of the following.
[02:38:23.531 --> 02:38:28.495]  And these are conservation easements, conservation directives, other sorts of programs.
[02:38:28.715 --> 02:38:31.717]  And then there's the protection, conservation, and enhancement of the environment.
[02:38:32.130 --> 02:38:43.859]  Now, under the definitions of the ZINVA Act, the environment includes the air, land, and water, and includes all layers of the atmosphere, and all organic and inorganic matter, including living organisms.
[02:38:44.239 --> 02:38:46.481]  So, this is taking over control.
[02:38:46.521 --> 02:38:50.404]  The government has no right to control living organisms, or, you know, it's crazy.
[02:38:50.524 --> 02:38:58.130]  And as far as the layers of the atmosphere go, we've been seeing the chemspraying for about two, three years now, where we didn't have it before.
[02:38:58.571 --> 02:39:00.272]  Now it's just unbelievable.
[02:39:00.731 --> 02:39:12.241]  The weather pattern in Alberta this year has been completely screwed up because the jet stream is off course and we're normally, you know, temperate land to dry land and we're just soaking wet.
[02:39:13.242 --> 02:39:14.723]  Good to hear from you, Kathy.
[02:39:14.743 --> 02:39:17.286]  Let's see if Mike, Texas Farmer, is back.
[02:39:17.326 --> 02:39:17.886]  Mike, you there?
[02:39:17.906 --> 02:39:20.108]  Hey Alex, I'm here, yep.
[02:39:20.388 --> 02:39:27.875]  Hey Alex, I'm not sure if you're familiar with Monmouth County, New Jersey, but that's where some of the most important battles of the Revolutionary War were fought.
[02:39:28.737 --> 02:39:49.610]  Some of those farms and orchards that are on that land, right where the battles were fought to gain our independence from the tyrant George III, those places are what made New Jersey, you know, to be called and be famous as the Garden State.
[02:39:50.410 --> 02:39:55.093]  And they're now annexing the farms to drill city water wells and basically just stealing their property.
[02:39:56.067 --> 02:39:56.487]  Exactly.
[02:39:56.547 --> 02:40:02.030]  And when I talk to people out here in Texas about the fact that I'm from New Jersey, and they say, well, where'd you grow up?
[02:40:02.070 --> 02:40:02.991]  By Newark Airport?
[02:40:03.331 --> 02:40:05.652]  That's what people think New Jersey was.
[02:40:05.672 --> 02:40:06.293]  And I say, no.
[02:40:06.393 --> 02:40:08.674]  No, there are beautiful farms all over the East Coast.
[02:40:09.514 --> 02:40:09.834]  Yes.
[02:40:10.155 --> 02:40:14.337]  And I said, if you want to know what your state is going to look like, if you let these
[02:40:14.890 --> 02:40:18.353]  Alex, you talk a lot about predictive programming, movies, what have you.
[02:40:18.613 --> 02:40:20.855]  You read Professor Tolkien's books a lot, The Lord of the Rings.
[02:40:44.028 --> 02:40:47.389]  What did they take out of those movies, or what did they leave out on purpose?
[02:40:47.690 --> 02:40:54.232]  The end of those books, where all the sheriffs and everybody are trying to take control over the Shire and Hobbiton.
[02:40:54.512 --> 02:41:00.895]  Professor Tolkien knew that that's what the British government was all about, and that's what was going to happen in society.
[02:41:01.195 --> 02:41:02.476]  Back then, when did he write them?
[02:41:02.496 --> 02:41:04.096]  In the 20s and the 30s?
[02:41:04.436 --> 02:41:07.218]  He knew that that's what society was coming to.
[02:41:07.578 --> 02:41:09.679]  When local tyrant
[02:41:11.352 --> 02:41:12.513]  Well said, Mike.
[02:41:12.573 --> 02:41:12.933]  Anything else?
[02:41:28.516 --> 02:41:30.277]  No, thanks Alex for doing what you do.
[02:41:30.377 --> 02:41:32.779]  I'm a brand new member of Prison Planet TV.
[02:41:33.019 --> 02:41:33.539]  Thank you, sir.
[02:41:33.579 --> 02:41:34.560]  We couldn't do it without you.
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:35.320]  Thank you so much.
[02:41:35.721 --> 02:41:39.863]  We're about to move PrisonPlanet.TV to even better, bigger servers and are updating it.
[02:41:40.544 --> 02:41:41.785]  Thank you so much for your support.
[02:41:45.205 --> 02:41:48.468]  Really what Mike just said is the beginning of what I was going to say.
[02:41:49.308 --> 02:41:58.015]  What we're going through now is a high-tech version of everything our ancestors, whether you're African, Japanese, it doesn't matter.
[02:41:58.656 --> 02:41:59.957]  We go through feudalism.
[02:42:00.497 --> 02:42:14.689]  Corrupt elites build castles, hire strong men, and then show up at your little town and say, you're going to give me your women, you're going to give me your young men to be my soldiers, and you're going to give me part of your food.
[02:42:16.204 --> 02:42:20.345]  Once they've got you to accept that, in every case, they then expand.
[02:42:21.225 --> 02:42:23.045]  Well, now you're not allowed to grow food.
[02:42:23.105 --> 02:42:24.266]  Only my cousin is.
[02:42:25.186 --> 02:42:26.446]  So the food prices go up.
[02:42:26.866 --> 02:42:29.987]  Now you've got to be my slave in my local factory.
[02:42:30.507 --> 02:42:32.928]  And so, humans do the same thing.
[02:42:33.188 --> 02:42:35.248]  Kind of like an oyster grows an oyster shell.
[02:42:35.728 --> 02:42:38.349]  Or a plant grows a certain way and turns towards the sun.
[02:42:38.409 --> 02:42:39.469]  They call it a tropism.
[02:42:41.245 --> 02:42:42.086]  It's ingrained.
[02:42:43.006 --> 02:42:46.207]  And so what happens is, here's the big secret about society.
[02:42:47.988 --> 02:42:53.270]  Good people just want to be married, have a good wife or husband, wonderful children.
[02:42:53.871 --> 02:42:58.873]  Once your belly's full, once you've got your little piece of land out in the sun, you just want to be safe.
[02:42:59.433 --> 02:43:00.413]  You just want to be left alone.
[02:43:02.314 --> 02:43:04.215]  And so governments will stage terror attacks.
[02:43:04.275 --> 02:43:08.417]  Governments will stage crises in the name of keeping you safe, in the name of taking care of you.
[02:43:09.486 --> 02:43:22.530]  And bad people who always want more power, who always want more control, who like to do sneaky things, who like to be backstabbing and manipulative, they always get into control.
[02:43:22.851 --> 02:43:24.771]  And then they start recruiting their buddies in.
[02:43:25.351 --> 02:43:29.533]  And then more ruthless people beneath them stab them in the back to get into power.
[02:43:29.913 --> 02:43:32.714]  And then more ruthless people beneath them stab them in the back.
[02:43:33.629 --> 02:43:34.269]  to get into power.
[02:43:34.930 --> 02:43:47.377]  And then, it's like a centrifugal purification system, like a race, a survival of the most evil, where there's always an acceleration into corruption.
[02:43:49.124 --> 02:44:09.241]  Now those corrupt people are always there in society, and there's only been a few cases in history where a true system, an enlightened system, where the good people understand these truths, create a system of government to guard against big government, to guard against corruption.
[02:44:09.981 --> 02:44:11.202]  But you have to be informed.
[02:44:11.222 --> 02:44:12.282]  You have to be virtuous.
[02:44:12.302 --> 02:44:13.563]  You have to have an understanding.
[02:44:13.823 --> 02:44:19.285]  You have to guard the jewel of liberty as if it's the most precious thing in the world, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[02:44:20.305 --> 02:44:21.386]  You've got to be armed.
[02:44:22.066 --> 02:44:24.407]  An armed person is a free person.
[02:44:24.867 --> 02:44:26.168]  A slave is always disarmed.
[02:44:26.208 --> 02:44:27.628]  A prisoner in a prison is disarmed.
[02:44:27.928 --> 02:44:29.009]  It's so elementary.
[02:44:30.785 --> 02:44:36.728]  And it's a law that tyrants and corrupt groups always want more, more, more, and always try to take over.
[02:44:37.029 --> 02:44:40.090]  But they told the American people after World War II, we're the good guys.
[02:44:40.410 --> 02:44:41.471]  We can do no wrong.
[02:44:41.891 --> 02:44:44.673]  We can, you know, do whatever we want.
[02:44:44.713 --> 02:44:46.254]  The government's going to grow, grow, grow.
[02:44:46.514 --> 02:44:47.574]  It's for your own good.
[02:44:47.815 --> 02:44:48.315]  And they've gotten...
[02:44:48.695 --> 02:44:55.357]  Over half the population, in some form or fashion, depended on them, and now they're going into the full collapse system.
[02:44:55.717 --> 02:44:58.138]  But the globalists have written countless books and white papers.
[02:44:58.458 --> 02:45:05.720]  They know the natural collapse that tyranny causes, that then normally shakes out the tyranny, and people have a chance to restart.
[02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:07.841]  Sometimes it gets worse, sometimes it gets better.
[02:45:08.421 --> 02:45:17.664]  They openly say, we're going to have a controlled collapse to make sure we stay on top and consolidate power, and expand our power through that.
[02:45:19.622 --> 02:45:42.399]  But if you look at Eastern European rulers, Western European rulers, Mesoamerican tribes, if you look at Asian rulers, in any period of history going back 6,000 plus years, in every single case of recorded history, countries, nations, nation states, empires, always go bad.
[02:45:43.540 --> 02:45:45.081]  And there's always denial about it.
[02:45:45.936 --> 02:46:11.927]  Because by the time you've gone from liberty and freedom that creates incredible wealth, then the next generation stops taking it as serious, starts becoming decadent, corrupt, corrupt people move into positions of power, they set precedents to get away with more and more corruption, they recruit more of their people, set new precedents, until finally it's just accepted that the government and ruling corporate class can do whatever they want.
[02:46:13.075 --> 02:46:32.784]  And if we look at the psychology, you know, I talk a lot about Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, killing tens of millions, slaughtering, murdering for no reason, even when people were submitting to Lenin, the NKVD would come back to him, the internal secret police, and say, alright, we've killed half this town, we've done all this, and they would say, kill more!
[02:46:33.524 --> 02:46:34.265]  Well, who do we kill?
[02:46:34.605 --> 02:46:35.605]  Kill randomly!
[02:46:36.046 --> 02:46:36.926]  Terrorize them!
[02:46:37.066 --> 02:46:38.006]  I want more blood!
[02:46:39.627 --> 02:46:40.788]  It's really just a sicko!
[02:46:41.761 --> 02:46:45.782]  See, people like Ted Bundy, who are really smart, become governors.
[02:46:46.462 --> 02:46:49.002]  They become Fox News hosts, CNN hosts.
[02:46:49.622 --> 02:46:51.603]  They become Homeland Security deputies.
[02:46:52.163 --> 02:46:54.163]  Because now they can get away with their evil.
[02:46:54.403 --> 02:47:03.065]  They can make everything they're doing secret, government becoming more secret, corporations becoming more secret, while they write unconstitutional laws to make everything we do public.
[02:47:03.345 --> 02:47:10.066]  So they have that advantage of intelligence, of armaments, of propaganda, of resources.
[02:47:11.348 --> 02:47:12.808]  And so, you look at every culture.
[02:47:13.748 --> 02:47:22.010]  You might get a strong king who, you know, won through war and whatever, and who wanted to build up his people, and you'd have a cycle of the philosopher king sometimes, and milk and honey.
[02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:23.750]  But then their kid gets in.
[02:47:23.770 --> 02:47:24.850]  They're corrupt and decadent.
[02:47:25.050 --> 02:47:27.731]  Then their kid gets in even worse, and their cousin kills them.
[02:47:28.091 --> 02:47:30.111]  This person's, you know, a schizophrenic lunatic.
[02:47:31.452 --> 02:47:34.872]  And they just go hog-wild nuts.
[02:47:35.752 --> 02:47:38.073]  We have now reached that hog-wild nuts area.
[02:47:38.313 --> 02:47:39.293]  I mean, go back
[02:47:40.853 --> 02:47:45.795]  4,000 years ago in the Mayan Kingdom, in Central America and Southern North America.
[02:47:46.235 --> 02:47:52.817]  They might do, out of a city of tens of thousands of people, a handful of sacrifices a year.
[02:47:54.077 --> 02:47:58.798]  And that was the priest class, training people, give me something that's really worth something to you.
[02:47:59.138 --> 02:48:00.639]  Show you're under my mind control.
[02:48:00.859 --> 02:48:03.800]  Well, if you'll give them your kids to have their heart cut out, you're under mind control.
[02:48:04.642 --> 02:48:11.484]  You fast forward a thousand years to where they were sacrificing so much of their population, their population was going down.
[02:48:11.724 --> 02:48:14.004]  They had killed off all the other tribes around them.
[02:48:18.346 --> 02:48:22.206]  Because for elites, it's not enough to have 20 mistresses.
[02:48:23.747 --> 02:48:24.607]  What's taboo?
[02:48:24.967 --> 02:48:27.888]  Strangling a child after you torture them.
[02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:30.262]  What's taboo?
[02:48:30.402 --> 02:48:31.905]  Burning down a city for fun.
[02:48:32.526 --> 02:48:33.348]  What's taboo?
[02:48:33.649 --> 02:48:35.994]  Crucifying 5,000 people because you feel like it.
[02:48:36.274 --> 02:48:36.915]  Roman legions.
[02:48:39.355 --> 02:48:41.076]  And then they start competing with each other.
[02:48:41.296 --> 02:48:49.179]  Then they have cultures of extremism, where the leaders have got to be more ruthless than their underlings, or they'll lose the respect of their psychopathic servants.
[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:51.861]  That's how the psychopath psychology works.
[02:48:52.401 --> 02:48:57.223]  Then they begin brainwashing the general public to be like them, so they're accepted of it.
[02:48:57.423 --> 02:49:00.605]  They start having gladiatorial games with people killing each other.
[02:49:00.825 --> 02:49:05.747]  So you'll cheer your neighbor being killed this week, and nobody will stand up for you when you're being killed a month later.
[02:49:07.864 --> 02:49:12.025]  So they've taken all of this, the globalists understand it, and they've institutionalized it.
[02:49:12.285 --> 02:49:23.349]  And you've got the British and Dutch royalty, and the Rothschild royalty, for any lack of a better term, and the Asian corrupt elites, and the Hispanic corrupt elites, all of them are the same.
[02:49:23.709 --> 02:49:25.770]  They are birds of a feather flying together.
[02:49:26.050 --> 02:49:27.710]  They enjoy what they're doing.
[02:49:29.611 --> 02:49:31.772]  And so to them, it's beautiful.
[02:49:32.788 --> 02:49:33.589]  Death and Destruction.
[02:49:33.609 --> 02:49:35.210]  Have you seen the most popular art?
[02:49:35.290 --> 02:49:36.831]  It's not Monet's.
[02:49:37.031 --> 02:49:39.433]  It's not Van Gogh's.
[02:49:39.954 --> 02:49:42.115]  It's not Leonardo da Vinci.
[02:49:43.837 --> 02:49:46.679]  It's not famous Dutch painters.
[02:49:47.420 --> 02:49:52.684]  No, it's now $25 million for a skull with maggots coming out of it.
[02:49:53.484 --> 02:49:58.548]  It's $10 million for a baby disemboweled in a tank of formaldehyde.
[02:49:59.389 --> 02:50:05.692]  When you look at Christie's auctions, the Wall Street, the elites, Schwarzenegger, I've seen stuff he's purchased.
[02:50:06.072 --> 02:50:08.813]  I mean, it is dead children covered in maggots.
[02:50:09.213 --> 02:50:11.574]  Their most, their favorite thing is dead children covered with maggots.
[02:50:11.614 --> 02:50:20.738]  Or Schwarzenegger, one of his favorite artists, there's photos of him online going to Germany to see the displays, is like dead babies, dead babies in Nazi uniforms.
[02:50:21.318 --> 02:50:21.879]  I mean, folks,
[02:50:23.106 --> 02:50:24.607]  Because they've had it all.
[02:50:25.127 --> 02:50:27.888]  And they got into darkness and it wasn't enough.
[02:50:28.488 --> 02:50:30.088]  The studies show it's the same with porn.
[02:50:31.249 --> 02:50:34.930]  You know, you're 15 years old looking at Playboy, you're shocked and amazed by it.
[02:50:35.350 --> 02:50:37.311]  Now you look at it, it does nothing for you.
[02:50:38.131 --> 02:50:39.712]  And so what it does is it sears...
[02:50:40.848 --> 02:50:41.568]  Afraid to answer it?
[02:51:05.245 --> 02:51:06.706]  Afraid to answer your door?
[02:51:07.146 --> 02:51:14.150]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about 10 times more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[02:51:14.450 --> 02:51:16.471]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[02:51:16.671 --> 02:51:18.432]  They are expensive payment plans.
[02:51:18.692 --> 02:51:23.194]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment plan?
[02:51:23.534 --> 02:51:27.677]  Zero debt in 90 days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed.

[02:51:58.604 --> 02:52:00.906]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:00.986 --> 02:52:03.188]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:03.308 --> 02:52:06.110]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:06.510 --> 02:52:11.274]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:11.635 --> 02:52:15.818]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:16.138 --> 02:52:18.480]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:18.580 --> 02:52:21.022]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:21.362 --> 02:52:23.944]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:24.285 --> 02:52:31.891]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:32.208 --> 02:52:37.493]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:37.613 --> 02:52:39.875]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:39.915 --> 02:52:43.878]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:44.138 --> 02:52:45.059]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:45.079 --> 02:52:46.520]  You're everyone else.

[02:54:21.058 --> 02:54:23.086]  So I hope that...
[02:54:24.448 --> 02:54:28.051]  Fleshes it out for people just a little bit historically.
[02:54:28.831 --> 02:54:33.495]  Why does every tyranny start huge wars and start slaughtering people for no reason?
[02:54:33.895 --> 02:54:35.397]  Why do their armies dress in black?
[02:54:35.457 --> 02:54:36.758]  Why do they rape and kill women?
[02:54:37.518 --> 02:54:44.064]  Because they recruit evil people in, and then they can never get enough evil people, so they start selling torture is virtuous.
[02:54:44.864 --> 02:54:46.325]  Jack Bauer is a hero.
[02:54:46.846 --> 02:54:51.469]  They start selling you that secret arrest is good, that cutting corners is good.
[02:54:52.550 --> 02:54:58.716]  And that's to get good people, who they see as weak-minded, to accept the wicked paradigm as something that's good.
[02:54:59.437 --> 02:55:03.400]  And there's no doubt that we're going into the worst of tyrannies.
[02:55:04.141 --> 02:55:07.424]  There is no doubt that the corruption is even worse than I could even imagine.
[02:55:07.524 --> 02:55:11.948]  Every day they scale new heights or depths of depravity.
[02:55:13.510 --> 02:55:14.731]  And none of us are safe.
[02:55:16.010 --> 02:55:18.071]  And we better understand that and get that through our head.
[02:55:18.111 --> 02:55:32.395]  And if you're a person who loves liberty and truth, and if you're someone who can see through all this and understand what's going on, I mean, you don't have to see through it now, it's out in the open, then you better do everything you can in small waves every day to alert people to what's happening and to stand up to corruption.
[02:55:32.915 --> 02:55:38.516]  Because they've tried to break our will, break our back, where we just kind of, yeah, I know it's corrupt, I'm done, just leave me alone.
[02:55:38.976 --> 02:55:40.037]  You can't do that.
[02:55:40.397 --> 02:55:42.117]  You've got to face these bullies down.
[02:55:42.377 --> 02:55:44.078]  You've got to call them out for what they are.
[02:55:44.818 --> 02:55:54.645]  They think we're so weak, they're all over the news saying, yes, we want to kill most people, yes, we want to kill babies, yes, we want to cut your energy off, yes, we want to destroy your industry.
[02:55:54.986 --> 02:55:58.308]  I mean, they actually say this, and then say they're good!
[02:55:58.889 --> 02:56:00.770]  See, first they teach us there's no right and wrong.
[02:56:01.551 --> 02:56:03.352]  Oh, don't criticize the Aztec culture.
[02:56:03.372 --> 02:56:04.893]  You know, every culture's different.
[02:56:05.053 --> 02:56:05.293]  Oh, really?
[02:56:05.894 --> 02:56:07.095]  Was the Nazi culture good?
[02:56:07.175 --> 02:56:07.755]  Obviously no.
[02:56:08.976 --> 02:56:12.139]  They take your capacity away, or at least try to,
[02:56:12.981 --> 02:56:18.463]  They try to put it into suspended animation, where you can't make decisions about what's good or bad.
[02:56:18.703 --> 02:56:20.404]  And then they start telling you what's good.
[02:56:21.264 --> 02:56:22.624]  See, you're not allowed to have a view.
[02:56:23.004 --> 02:56:26.886]  They've got a view, and they're going to cram it down your throat in an arrogant, over-the-top way.
[02:56:27.086 --> 02:56:30.567]  They act like everything they're doing is good, when it's obviously bad.
[02:56:31.307 --> 02:56:34.488]  It's time to get in their face and let these scum know we're not backing down.
[02:56:35.249 --> 02:56:36.829]  Dale in Indiana, who's a farmer.
[02:56:36.869 --> 02:56:37.249]  Go ahead.
[02:56:38.230 --> 02:56:39.510]  Yes, Alex.
[02:56:39.730 --> 02:56:40.731]  Long time listener.
[02:56:40.771 --> 02:56:41.831]  First time caller here.
[02:56:43.045 --> 02:56:49.007]  We had a situation develop here in Indiana, in our county, through the zoning board out here.
[02:56:50.168 --> 02:57:01.551]  And the zoning board was wanting to limit how many times a landowner, the farmer, could subdivide his land to sell a portion of it off.
[02:57:01.871 --> 02:57:06.633]  Yeah, that's always done, so you gotta go buy off the politicians for a variance.
[02:57:08.274 --> 02:57:08.574]  Right.
[02:57:10.591 --> 02:57:16.454]  There was about 60 landowners at the Zoning Board meeting, and two gentlemen got up and spoke in opposition to it.
[02:57:17.535 --> 02:57:21.718]  And then I raised my hand and got up and went and addressed the board.
[02:57:22.658 --> 02:57:30.083]  And I said, and I pointed my finger over to the county attorney, and I said, he's the fiduciary for everything that goes on in this county.
[02:57:31.344 --> 02:57:33.105]  And he says, no, I'm not.
[02:57:33.546 --> 02:57:34.726]  I said, oh, yes, you are.
[02:57:34.746 --> 02:57:36.047]  He says, oh, no, I'm not.
[02:57:36.167 --> 02:57:36.968]  I said, now listen.
[02:57:38.078 --> 02:57:41.639]  It doesn't make any difference what any of these board members want to do in this county.
[02:57:42.200 --> 02:57:45.401]  Before they can do anything, they have to pass it by you to get your okay.
[02:57:45.901 --> 02:57:47.321]  So that makes you the fiduciary.
[02:57:48.102 --> 02:57:50.743]  And being the fiduciary takes on liability.
[02:57:51.083 --> 02:57:56.945]  Now if there's any one constitution being done in the county, in any of these counties within the United States of America,
[02:57:57.987 --> 02:58:01.528]  That county attorney is orchestrating the global system being implemented.
[02:58:01.748 --> 02:58:03.829]  It is, it's Agenda 21, and that's good.
[02:58:04.109 --> 02:58:06.790]  They're making it personal, but they always say it isn't personal.
[02:58:07.090 --> 02:58:08.851]  You go, listen, it's personal now.
[02:58:09.111 --> 02:58:13.893]  And when you see them in a restaurant, you walk up and tell who they're with, you know you're with a dirtbag, don't you?
[02:58:14.233 --> 02:58:14.953]  You shun them.
[02:58:15.253 --> 02:58:18.795]  We stopped licking their boots and calling them officials or authorities.
[02:58:19.135 --> 02:58:21.616]  So what did he do after you pointed out what he was up to?
[02:58:22.432 --> 02:58:25.313]  Well, two weeks later, he resigned his position and left the county.
[02:58:25.473 --> 02:58:25.853]  Good!
[02:58:26.254 --> 02:58:28.435]  He moved on to find some good slaves he could bleed.
[02:58:29.075 --> 02:58:29.655]  Anything else?
[02:58:30.676 --> 02:58:33.217]  Uh, that's about it, but, uh... Alright, I'm out of time.
[02:58:33.297 --> 02:58:34.037]  God bless you.
[02:58:34.057 --> 02:58:34.937]  Great job, crew.
