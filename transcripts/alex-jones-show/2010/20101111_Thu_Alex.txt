[00:00:04.452 --> 00:00:05.092]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.773 --> 00:00:06.794]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.534 --> 00:00:08.655]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:10.116]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:11.797]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:16.040]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.723]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.333]  This is going to be a radio transmission that you are not going to want to miss.
[00:00:33.353 --> 00:00:34.313]  It is Thursday, 11-11.
[00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.934]  11-11-10.
[00:00:37.894 --> 00:00:43.237]  Thursday, the 11th day of November 2010.
[00:00:43.357 --> 00:00:46.838]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:50.620]  Here is the jam-packed transmission we have.
[00:00:51.738 --> 00:00:54.160]  Bombshell FEMA camps confirmed.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:05.690]  I've now been authorized to talk about our discoveries working in the last four or five months on the TV show Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:11.375]  I can reveal to you quite a bit of this Friday's episode.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.684]  That most of the crew, and I agree with them, believes is the most powerful of the episodes.
[00:01:20.204 --> 00:01:22.606]  The JFK one is groundbreaking, coming up next Friday.
[00:01:22.626 --> 00:01:25.548]  But this Friday, coming up tomorrow night, 9 p.m.
[00:01:25.588 --> 00:01:29.830]  Central, bombshell FEMA camps confirmed.
[00:01:30.551 --> 00:01:37.856]  And that's on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, a little five-minute video I made about it, and an article dealing with it.
[00:01:41.088 --> 00:01:42.810]  And they confirm FEMA camps.
[00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.032]  They confirm residential centers for families.
[00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:51.177]  They confront the two congressmen who've introduced the legislation to formalize the camps, the Emergency Centers Act.
[00:01:51.817 --> 00:01:58.063]  They talk to a former FBI agent who talks about the threat fusion centers being spy grids for the American people.
[00:01:58.483 --> 00:02:02.667]  The MIAC report, the Homeland Security report, it is extremely powerful.
[00:02:02.847 --> 00:02:04.148]  And I go out to FEMA.
[00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:10.313]  Homeland Security facilities with Ventura.
[00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:16.919]  We go to the Georgia FEMA coffin facility and they're there with 18 wheelers taking them away because they heard we were coming.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.562]  I mean, this is amazing information.
[00:02:19.602 --> 00:02:20.483]  It's groundbreaking.
[00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:26.329]  Tyrell Ventura, Jesse Ventura's son, is going to be joining us coming up in about 30 minutes from now.
[00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:30.637]  And we're going to reveal quite a bit of it here today.
[00:02:31.198 --> 00:02:33.619]  But very important, this is groundbreaking.
[00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:41.846]  We've had Glenn Beck and others say, oh, I believe FEMA camps are real, and then hype it up for a month, and then come out and say they're not.
[00:02:42.306 --> 00:02:53.935]  Even though there's legislation, and Houston Chronicle, and New York Times telling us how great the camps are, and the clergy response teams, and the military training for gun confiscation, Glenn Beck says it doesn't exist.
[00:02:55.076 --> 00:03:00.542]  We need to admit these camps exist to be able to respond to this gulag archipelago that's being set up.
[00:03:00.602 --> 00:03:05.286]  Then Max Keiser on what's happening with the economy worldwide and dollar devaluation.
[00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:09.971]  Former top stockbroker, TV host, researcher Max Keiser will be joining us.
[00:03:10.351 --> 00:03:12.673]  What's the other huge news today?
[00:03:16.016 --> 00:03:18.358]  Glenn Beck has had his hype machine going.
[00:03:19.687 --> 00:03:29.714]  For the last month, saying that he would reveal today, and now he has, the head of the New World Order, the puppet master, the king of it all.
[00:03:30.535 --> 00:03:32.717]  And I said two weeks ago it would be George Soros on air.
[00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:39.707]  Not just because I could guess that, but because we have sources inside Fox.
[00:03:39.747 --> 00:03:49.337]  You notice Media Matters has a report out today saying Jones correctly predicted a month beforehand that Lou Dobbs would be moving to Fox Business.
[00:03:50.178 --> 00:03:54.603]  That's because I have multiple sources at the highest levels inside Fox.
[00:03:56.149 --> 00:04:05.952]  I have been told directly that Glenn Beck has five people full-time watching this show and taking what we cover and then repackaging it as kind of a neocon thing.
[00:04:06.432 --> 00:04:10.293]  But look, Glenn Beck was going to be the main focus of my new Tea Party film.
[00:04:10.353 --> 00:04:13.194]  Now he's not because he's come so far.
[00:04:13.354 --> 00:04:14.114]  I don't trust him.
[00:04:15.015 --> 00:04:21.897]  I particularly don't like having all my material taken and then twisted, all the key information and research we do.
[00:04:23.335 --> 00:04:23.736]  I don't
[00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.546]  A month ago, I was up to liking him about 60%.
[00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:42.907]  Now, I like him about 80%.
[00:04:43.007 --> 00:04:51.152]  I mean, Lindbeck is, as I said months ago, if he continues on his progression, within a year or less, he'll be as hardcore as Alex Jones.
[00:04:51.472 --> 00:04:53.233]  He's done something absolutely incredible.
[00:04:53.253 --> 00:04:54.854]  I haven't talked about Lindbeck in a month or so.
[00:04:54.874 --> 00:04:56.275]  We're going to talk about him coming up.
[00:04:56.335 --> 00:04:57.055]  This is big.
[00:04:57.235 --> 00:04:57.955]  This is big.
[00:04:58.216 --> 00:04:58.636]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.972 --> 00:05:03.255]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:04.617]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:09.041]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:14.888]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:05:15.188 --> 00:05:17.170]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.013]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:26.658]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:05:26.858 --> 00:05:28.659]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:34.143]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:05:34.403 --> 00:05:39.407]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:05:39.687 --> 00:05:44.851]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:05:45.051 --> 00:05:48.014]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:05:48.254 --> 00:05:51.136]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:05:51.156 --> 00:05:52.017]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:06:01.288 --> 00:06:02.609]  Subject to other police action.
[00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.371]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:04.711 --> 00:06:08.254]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:08.294 --> 00:06:10.857]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:10.877 --> 00:06:16.322]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:22.988]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:23.408 --> 00:06:28.932]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:29.392 --> 00:06:33.054]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:33.555 --> 00:06:37.557]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:37.857 --> 00:06:43.381]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:43.801 --> 00:06:46.783]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:47.363 --> 00:06:48.784]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:49.324 --> 00:06:49.765]  It's here.

[00:06:59.096 --> 00:07:03.039]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:09.304]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:07:09.684 --> 00:07:16.790]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.653]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:07:21.954 --> 00:07:25.516]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com
[00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:34.280]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter and see what he has to say.
[00:08:00.598 --> 00:08:02.805]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.387 --> 00:08:06.176]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.065 --> 00:08:19.048]  Well, this is going to be one of the most powerful broadcasts we've ever done, the most jam-packed.
[00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:22.150]  Years ago, I'd say that probably once a year.
[00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:29.755]  Now, every month or so, I say this is going to perhaps be one of the most important broadcasts ever, because everything is happening right now.
[00:08:29.815 --> 00:08:37.600]  The world government's being announced, the dollar's being killed, the austerity is being brought in as all of our tax money goes to the offshore banks.
[00:08:38.928 --> 00:08:40.710]  It is all happening right now.
[00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:55.087]  Coming up in about 22 minutes from now, bombshell FEMA camps confirmed by Jesse Ventura's conspiracy theory show proves FEMA camps exist for American citizens in new episode that airs Friday, November
[00:08:55.848 --> 00:08:56.469]  We're good to go.
[00:09:15.802 --> 00:09:19.906]  We're going to have Tyrell Ventura, who works on the show, his son, joining us.
[00:09:20.086 --> 00:09:23.049]  They were talking to me about getting Ventura on next week about the JFK.
[00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:24.169]  That's his favorite episode.
[00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.553]  They believe this is the most powerful and important and newsworthy.
[00:09:29.214 --> 00:09:39.043]  Remember, right as ClimateGate broke last year, Ventura's special on that, with yours truly in it, came out, saying all the same info, even though it had been shot months before.
[00:09:39.443 --> 00:09:40.764]  And that made national news.
[00:09:40.844 --> 00:09:42.124]  It was major breaking news.
[00:09:42.524 --> 00:09:46.866]  They got Santer, the head of the UN program, to admit that they falsified reports.
[00:09:48.127 --> 00:09:50.548]  And the media was still trying to deny it at that point.
[00:09:50.568 --> 00:09:56.030]  But the Santer info, you know, really put the cherry on top of that situation.
[00:09:56.071 --> 00:09:56.751]  So that's coming up.
[00:09:56.811 --> 00:10:00.973]  Max Keiser coming on about the economy and what's happening as well in about an hour and a half.
[00:10:01.843 --> 00:10:03.403]  I talked to Rand Paul's people today.
[00:10:03.843 --> 00:10:17.526]  He has been totally slammed with national media, but he is coming on either tomorrow or maybe next week, if not the next, because he's got to be in Senate ethics training, because he's never been in politics, and he's a new senator.
[00:10:17.546 --> 00:10:23.908]  He's got to learn all the rules and the decorum and all the rest of the garbage all next week, but they're trying today, tomorrow.
[00:10:24.588 --> 00:10:27.451]  Uh, Sunday or then the next week, but we talked to them.
[00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:28.472]  They apologized.
[00:10:28.492 --> 00:10:30.373]  So they've been really busy, but they do want to come on the show.
[00:10:30.393 --> 00:10:35.578]  I could have already had him on for 10 minutes, but I want an extended at least 30 minute to an hour interview with Rand Paul.
[00:10:36.138 --> 00:10:39.481]  Uh, so that is, uh, being prepared right now, getting that lined up.
[00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:46.281]  So, Jesse Ventura confirms FEMA camps, threat fusion centers, as the domestic spy grid.
[00:10:46.641 --> 00:10:51.082]  Those details are up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:51.782 --> 00:10:54.903]  Drudge is top-linked to us again.
[00:10:54.983 --> 00:10:56.323]  Top-link on Drudge.
[00:10:56.783 --> 00:10:59.624]  Drudge stirs national debate on TSA abuse.
[00:10:59.644 --> 00:11:10.247]  I've never really written an article about Matt Drudge, but that was my plan yesterday, was to point out that he forced this into the mainstream, and now it is everywhere, and Atlantic Month
[00:11:10.267 --> 00:11:10.490]  Hopefully.
[00:11:11.499 --> 00:11:20.701]  Has an article where they talk to TSA people and the big joke is they call the naked body scanners the male member measurement system.
[00:11:21.161 --> 00:11:31.463]  They use a vulgar term I can't use on radio and I hate to talk about stuff like this but it's happening to our wives, our husbands, our children, our sons, our daughters, so we have to discuss it.
[00:11:31.823 --> 00:11:35.644]  There is a huge backlash and there's also another headline up there.
[00:11:35.684 --> 00:11:40.045]  Backlash grows over TSA's naked strip search CBS News from CNET.
[00:11:40.865 --> 00:11:53.954]  So this is a huge issue, hundreds of articles a day, as it comes out that they let illegal aliens go through without the pat-downs, that they let illegal aliens rent planes, that they have illegal aliens and pedophiles working as TSA agents.
[00:11:54.315 --> 00:11:56.136]  This is all breaking now.
[00:11:56.676 --> 00:12:01.900]  It's coming out that Chertoff's making the money as the CEO of the Naked Body company.
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:09.225]  They admitted to Atlantic Monthly, to Jeff Goldberg, he's such an insider, that they're doing this to intimidate you.
[00:12:09.405 --> 00:12:09.986]  They admit it!
[00:12:10.856 --> 00:12:14.378]  to intimidate people to make them submit to the naked body scanners.
[00:12:14.638 --> 00:12:16.098]  So that's confirmed.
[00:12:16.138 --> 00:12:16.659]  It's confirmed.
[00:12:16.679 --> 00:12:17.819]  They're recording the images.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.782]  They have TSA in another room watching it and laughing and printing off printouts of it.
[00:12:24.582 --> 00:12:27.524]  Incredible report that is up right now.
[00:12:29.352 --> 00:12:41.220]  Right now, at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, Drudge stirs national debate on TSA probe, and it's got all the new info from Atlantic Monthly about the male member measurement system.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:49.745]  They use a different term, you can read it from Atlantic Monthly, prestigious publication, with Jeff Goldberg right there on that front.
[00:12:49.825 --> 00:12:51.686]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:12:51.726 --> 00:12:52.727]  It's worse than we thought.
[00:12:53.808 --> 00:12:56.730]  So, we've got the FEMA cams confirmed info breaking.
[00:12:58.051 --> 00:13:03.839]  We've got the incredible economic developments in the G20 meeting right now in Seoul, South Korea, yesterday and today.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.243]  We've got students' fees protest.
[00:13:07.544 --> 00:13:08.525]  This is just the beginning.
[00:13:08.605 --> 00:13:14.312]  Confirmed government provocateurs trying to make the peaceful protesters look bad.
[00:13:14.853 --> 00:13:21.056]  And now the British Prime Minister is calling for restricting protesting in England, like Nazi Germany, in the name of stopping violence.
[00:13:21.517 --> 00:13:26.740]  We have British Ministry of Defense reports from three years ago predicting all of this.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.640]  They are staging it.
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.381]  Here's the Daily Mail.
[00:13:29.421 --> 00:13:31.482]  Hijacking of a very middle-class protest.
[00:13:31.862 --> 00:13:35.704]  Anarchists cause chaos as 50,000 students take to the streets over fees.
[00:13:36.165 --> 00:13:37.265]  Kurt Nimmo's article.
[00:13:37.726 --> 00:13:41.328]  Agent provocateurs turn tuition protests into violent melee.
[00:13:43.529 --> 00:13:44.969]  It's all coming up today.
[00:13:45.849 --> 00:13:49.431]  But I'm going to talk about Glenn Beck some, and I'm going to do it in two parts.
[00:13:50.291 --> 00:14:04.276]  I don't really have time to watch him much, but my film crew has been watching him every day in the last few months, up until a few weeks ago, when I made the decision to not make the Glenn Beck deception.
[00:14:05.936 --> 00:14:06.877]  I don't trust Glenn Beck.
[00:14:08.595 --> 00:14:09.676]  I don't particularly like him.
[00:14:10.056 --> 00:14:16.439]  I don't like the fact that he says Ron Paul supporters might want to blow up buildings, that the army might need to be used against us two years ago.
[00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:28.885]  I don't like the fact that he says if you question government-sponsored terror, that you work for George Soros, when media matters and all of Soros's outfits are even more anti-9-11 truth than Beck is.
[00:14:29.326 --> 00:14:31.126]  I don't like his intellectual dishonesty.
[00:14:31.547 --> 00:14:34.188]  I don't like him denying the FEMA camps when we sent him all the info.
[00:14:35.603 --> 00:14:44.448]  I've confirmed now by three high-level Fox people that Glenn Beck, for at least two years, has five people at his Mercury Media outfit.
[00:14:44.468 --> 00:14:47.949]  He produces his own show, watching everything we do and taking it.
[00:14:48.229 --> 00:14:49.530]  People now have really noticed this.
[00:14:50.331 --> 00:14:52.251]  But, in a way, it's good to get the info out.
[00:14:52.312 --> 00:14:54.733]  I just don't like him spinning it into a neoconnish way.
[00:14:55.333 --> 00:15:00.074]  Neoconnish direction, like liberals are the source of all evil and conservatives are good.
[00:15:00.435 --> 00:15:02.575]  There aren't real conservatives in many areas of government.
[00:15:02.595 --> 00:15:03.536]  They're globalists as well.
[00:15:03.896 --> 00:15:06.416]  They're, quote, progressives in conservative clothing.
[00:15:07.977 --> 00:15:17.700]  But more and more, because he's getting more hardcore about eugenics, poison in the water, lithium, brainwashing, government tyranny,
[00:15:19.594 --> 00:15:23.838]  It's doing more good than harm, and he's going in the right direction.
[00:15:23.898 --> 00:15:29.923]  So my film, even though it'd be a great seller and get a bunch of attention, it's not going to be about Glenn Beck.
[00:15:29.963 --> 00:15:30.724]  He'll be part of it.
[00:15:31.825 --> 00:15:33.907]  And I'm sure he'll probably betray us down the road.
[00:15:33.927 --> 00:15:35.128]  Again, I don't trust him.
[00:15:36.229 --> 00:15:41.974]  But, this news I have is so big, I can hardly speak right now.
[00:15:42.979 --> 00:15:49.422]  Now, I'm mad at Beck on one front, and later in the show, in fact, in the last 30 minutes, I will reveal the real Puppet Masters.
[00:15:50.303 --> 00:15:50.523]  Okay?
[00:15:50.583 --> 00:15:57.126]  And we always get up here and talk about puppets, and I've had puppets on the show, and talked about why are we looking at the puppets instead of the strings and the guy holding them.
[00:15:57.826 --> 00:16:01.568]  And there's Beck again, doing the same thing, for a month, building it up.
[00:16:01.888 --> 00:16:05.610]  He was going to tell you today who the Puppet Masters are, and it's on his website.
[00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.431]  He says it's George Soros.
[00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:08.752]  That was not hard to predict.
[00:16:09.662 --> 00:16:16.753]  And Soros is calling for global taxes, global government, but so is Bernanke, so is Paulson, so is all these guys.
[00:16:18.976 --> 00:16:23.338]  Soros is high level, but he's not at the pyramid, capstone level.
[00:16:24.199 --> 00:16:30.702]  He's that management group right below it, like a Henry Kissinger or a George Shultz, or as a big name, Brzezinski.
[00:16:30.942 --> 00:16:36.945]  Brzezinski's above Soros, probably even above Kissinger at certain levels from my studying.
[00:16:37.465 --> 00:16:42.027]  I will reveal the real puppet masters in two hours and fifteen minutes, okay?
[00:16:42.548 --> 00:16:45.769]  So, Beck says, as I predicted two weeks ago, it's George Soros.
[00:16:45.809 --> 00:16:46.510]  Give me a break.
[00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:48.191]  Okay, give me a break.
[00:16:48.751 --> 00:17:00.741]  But, he did something this morning, he did it last night, I didn't watch, I came in at 7.30 in the morning, Matt Ryan was already here, and he said, you gotta see this.
[00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:03.604]  You've got to see this.
[00:17:05.706 --> 00:17:11.470]  And, uh, I'm just gonna play it first, then come back from break and comment.
[00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.353]  But, the PrisonPlanet.com headline,
[00:17:16.482 --> 00:17:18.925]  Again, my trust in Beck was at 20%, then at 40, 50, 60.
[00:17:19.766 --> 00:17:22.288]  It's gone to 70, 80% right now.
[00:17:22.889 --> 00:17:23.490]  And you know why?
[00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.071]  Beck realizes he's in danger.
[00:17:25.111 --> 00:17:30.217]  He realizes he's playing in an arena, at a level, that is incredibly dangerous.
[00:17:30.317 --> 00:17:31.538]  And he's listening to this show.
[00:17:32.543 --> 00:17:36.505]  We have written about top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save America.
[00:17:37.486 --> 00:17:40.948]  Clintonite Obama needs OKC bombing to reconnect with the American people.
[00:17:41.108 --> 00:17:42.509]  We've been writing about this for three months.
[00:17:43.189 --> 00:17:47.612]  And now they're going to stage in Oklahoma City and blame it on the Patriot movement and yes, Glenn Beck.
[00:17:49.639 --> 00:17:57.461]  Glenn Beck has come out and talked about government-sponsored terrorism, and how they're going to blame it on him, and me, and others.
[00:17:58.322 --> 00:17:59.302]  Folks, this is big.
[00:17:59.782 --> 00:18:00.862]  Prison Planet headline.
[00:18:00.902 --> 00:18:02.443]  Get it to all the neocons you know.
[00:18:02.683 --> 00:18:04.704]  They get mad if you talk about government-sponsored terror.
[00:18:05.124 --> 00:18:07.344]  Glenn Beck, government preparing to stage terror.
[00:18:07.665 --> 00:18:08.305]  This is big.
[00:18:08.345 --> 00:18:08.845]  Here's the clip.
[00:18:09.245 --> 00:18:11.086]  Why does the left need this violence?
[00:18:11.146 --> 00:18:18.248]  Well, listen to a clip from a Democratic pollster, Mark Penn, happened just the other day, and yet no one pays attention to it.
[00:18:18.948 --> 00:18:22.029]  How can the left win the country?
[00:18:22.569 --> 00:18:22.909]  Watch.
[00:18:24.389 --> 00:18:26.330]  Cabinets don't really sell things.
[00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.610]  The President himself has to reconnect with the people.
[00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:32.891]  Remember, President Clinton reconnected through Oklahoma, right?
[00:18:32.951 --> 00:18:35.331]  And the President right now, he seems removed.
[00:18:35.891 --> 00:18:39.652]  And it wasn't until that speech that he re-clicked with the American public.
[00:18:40.072 --> 00:18:41.553]  Obama needs a similar kind of...
[00:18:44.133 --> 00:18:46.855]  Obama needs a similar kind of event.
[00:18:47.675 --> 00:18:47.815]  Oh!
[00:18:48.596 --> 00:18:49.576]  Like Oklahoma City.
[00:18:50.397 --> 00:18:58.522]  If only Barack Obama could have the opportunity to speak to America after another Oklahoma City type event, then he'll politically be in good shape.
[00:19:00.623 --> 00:19:01.043]  Wow!
[00:19:03.004 --> 00:19:10.249]  Now, according to Drummond Pike, the founder of Tides, who, Drummond, I hope you watch this week because, oh, it's all coming undone this week.
[00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:14.734]  I will be the guy who causes the next Oklahoma City.
[00:19:15.214 --> 00:19:19.455]  This is in a letter, an appeal to advertisers of Fox.
[00:19:19.495 --> 00:19:22.175]  Dear Fox advertisers, read this part of it.
[00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:26.896]  No one, left, right, center, wants to see another Oklahoma City.
[00:19:26.976 --> 00:19:28.657]  The next assassin may succeed.
[00:19:28.797 --> 00:19:30.837]  If so, there will be blood on many hands.
[00:19:31.217 --> 00:19:34.158]  They are setting up another Oklahoma City.
[00:19:34.198 --> 00:19:39.239]  They are claiming that one is coming, and they've already marked the one who caused it.
[00:19:41.032 --> 00:19:44.935]  But don't you miss Wednesday's show when I show you violence and the pressure...
[00:19:59.462 --> 00:19:59.962]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:59.982 --> 00:20:03.885]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[00:20:04.146 --> 00:20:08.069]  That something is Atwood Rope, the highest quality rope made in the USA.
[00:20:08.129 --> 00:20:13.733]  From exotic braids for military, rescue, arborists, shipyards, tow line, or boating.
[00:20:13.953 --> 00:20:17.456]  Quality rope at affordable prices you and your customers can depend on.
[00:20:17.636 --> 00:20:21.059]  Find a dealer or shop online at atwoodrope.net.

[00:20:26.383 --> 00:20:29.145]  Atwood Rope, working to keep the world tied together.
[00:20:29.625 --> 00:20:30.686]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:30.866 --> 00:20:35.249]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:35.429 --> 00:20:41.133]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:41.233 --> 00:20:44.655]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:44.875 --> 00:20:47.477]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:47.597 --> 00:20:52.520]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:52.881]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:54.302]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.146 --> 00:21:04.269]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:21:04.329 --> 00:21:05.590]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:09.473]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:21:09.753 --> 00:21:12.295]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[00:21:12.495 --> 00:21:14.296]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:21:14.477 --> 00:21:16.778]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:26.552]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:21:26.832 --> 00:21:30.017]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:21:30.077 --> 00:21:33.182]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:21:33.382 --> 00:21:35.203]  Call John Ballman today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:21:35.303 --> 00:21:39.144]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth a zero.
[00:21:39.164 --> 00:21:39.904]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:21:39.944 --> 00:21:41.985]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[00:21:42.005 --> 00:21:42.585]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:04.724]  Tyranny is here.
[00:22:05.084 --> 00:22:08.728]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:22:08.949 --> 00:22:11.231]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:22:11.251 --> 00:22:16.697]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:22:17.117 --> 00:22:23.364]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:22:23.764 --> 00:22:29.326]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:22:29.746 --> 00:22:33.427]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[00:22:33.927 --> 00:22:37.928]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:22:38.208 --> 00:22:43.730]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:47.131]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:22:47.711 --> 00:22:49.132]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:22:49.692 --> 00:22:50.132]  It's here.

[00:23:44.935 --> 00:23:45.135]  That's 1-877-886-3653.
[00:23:53.941 --> 00:24:09.505]  Obama needs a similar kind of event.
[00:24:10.325 --> 00:24:10.465]  Oh!
[00:24:11.245 --> 00:24:12.226]  Like Oklahoma City.
[00:24:13.066 --> 00:24:21.128]  If only Barack Obama can have the opportunity to speak to America after another Oklahoma City type event, then he'll politically be in good shape.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:23.681]  Wow!
[00:24:25.624 --> 00:24:32.896]  Now, according to Drummond Pike, the founder of Tides, who, Drummond, I hope you watch this week, because, oh, it's all coming undone this week.
[00:24:34.341 --> 00:24:37.362]  I will be the guy who causes the next Oklahoma City.
[00:24:37.862 --> 00:24:42.103]  This is in a letter, an appeal to advertisers of Fox.
[00:24:42.143 --> 00:24:44.824]  Dear Fox advertisers, read this part of it.
[00:24:45.444 --> 00:24:49.545]  No one, left, right, center, wants to see another Oklahoma City.
[00:24:49.625 --> 00:24:51.285]  The next assassin may succeed.
[00:24:51.445 --> 00:24:53.466]  If so, there will be blood on many hands.
[00:24:53.866 --> 00:24:56.787]  They are setting up another Oklahoma City.
[00:24:56.827 --> 00:25:01.728]  They are claiming that one is coming, and they've already marked the one who caused it.
[00:25:03.834 --> 00:25:07.896]  And he goes on, the full video clip is in Glenn Beck, Government Preparing to Stage Terror.
[00:25:08.257 --> 00:25:10.278]  We also have Michael Savage saying the same thing.
[00:25:10.698 --> 00:25:11.539]  This is a big deal.
[00:25:11.579 --> 00:25:13.660]  This is the main lining of stage terror.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.262]  But it's not going to be the Tides Foundation or George Soros.
[00:25:18.103 --> 00:25:19.023]  You had to pick a group.
[00:25:19.483 --> 00:25:24.426]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, it came out in FBI memos that people had to sue to get.
[00:25:25.527 --> 00:25:29.109]  And they sued and the government blacked out certain areas.
[00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:31.231]  In another lawsuit, they blacked out other areas.
[00:25:32.321 --> 00:25:39.749]  Jesse Trinidad, the lawyer, this was in major news a few years ago, was able to put both of the same memo together and read the whole memo.
[00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:47.717]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center, that's why they hate me so much I talk about this, was in there running Elohim City and McVeigh.
[00:25:48.318 --> 00:25:49.239]  And we also have
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:59.447]  The ATF informant inside there, and they later tried to indict her to shut her up, and she came out and said the same thing.
[00:25:59.948 --> 00:26:04.111]  It's just like the FBI with the latest Muslims in DC.
[00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:10.576]  I mean, it came out, they went and created the group, the FBI was leading it, commanding them to stage the terror attack.
[00:26:10.616 --> 00:26:11.017]  Same thing, 1993.
[00:26:13.109 --> 00:26:21.213]  New York Times, CBS News, they released the audio tapes with the FBI cooking the bomb, training the driver, finding the people, going forward, letting the bombing take place.
[00:26:21.253 --> 00:26:22.774]  I mean, these are just facts.
[00:26:22.834 --> 00:26:24.335]  Gulf of Tonkin is a fact.
[00:26:24.735 --> 00:26:25.976]  Northwoods is a fact.
[00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:27.477]  I just cover the truth.
[00:26:28.137 --> 00:26:28.457]  Okay?
[00:26:28.537 --> 00:26:31.739]  And we're apolitical here, except that we want liberty and freedom, but we're not partisan.
[00:26:33.709 --> 00:26:36.390]  I'm having a real dialogue through the show with Glenn Beck right now.
[00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:37.550]  His people are listening right now.
[00:26:38.131 --> 00:26:44.533]  And I put it out a year ago, and I put it out six months ago, and a few months ago, I said, Glenn, talk about fluoride in the water.
[00:26:44.593 --> 00:26:45.794]  Talk about lithium in the water.
[00:26:45.834 --> 00:26:46.754]  Talk about eugenics.
[00:26:47.094 --> 00:26:50.235]  Talk about world government for extermination purposes.
[00:26:50.715 --> 00:26:51.296]  Talk about it.
[00:26:52.196 --> 00:26:52.996]  And he did do that.
[00:26:53.276 --> 00:26:54.537]  Talk about Goldman Sachs.
[00:26:54.837 --> 00:26:57.058]  Talk about the Federal Reserve.
[00:26:57.318 --> 00:26:58.018]  He did that.
[00:26:58.418 --> 00:26:59.559]  Talk about Woodrow Wilson.
[00:26:59.579 --> 00:26:59.939]  He did that.
[00:27:01.534 --> 00:27:06.375]  Literally, he's programming his show off of this broadcast and getting better and better.
[00:27:07.336 --> 00:27:08.816]  He's a weasel in the past.
[00:27:08.936 --> 00:27:09.556]  I don't trust him.
[00:27:09.776 --> 00:27:10.557]  I don't trust you, Glenn.
[00:27:10.997 --> 00:27:12.357]  But you finally got it.
[00:27:12.797 --> 00:27:17.879]  They are going to stage in Oklahoma City, and only by exposing, as I've been saying for over a year,
[00:27:19.227 --> 00:27:20.467]  Only by exposing it.
[00:27:21.148 --> 00:27:24.148]  And I exposed the whole Atari thing seven months before it happened.
[00:27:24.168 --> 00:27:25.769]  I said they will set up Atari militia.
[00:27:26.069 --> 00:27:27.609]  I could tell by watching their videos.
[00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:28.650]  They had feds inside.
[00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:34.431]  The way it was produced, the way they were dressing, the way they had the guy up there like a dictator with a guy behind him.
[00:27:34.751 --> 00:27:35.171]  I knew it!
[00:27:35.611 --> 00:27:37.692]  Out of 400 militias, I said that's it!
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.562]  I understand this.
[00:27:40.723 --> 00:27:42.206]  I eat, drink, and sleep it.
[00:27:42.827 --> 00:27:44.410]  And so I should be flattered.
[00:27:44.871 --> 00:27:49.140]  They say imitation is the greatest form of flattery.
[00:27:50.964 --> 00:27:51.905]  It's the biggest compliment.
[00:27:52.625 --> 00:28:06.033]  But I can find no fault with what he's doing other than the fact of saying that the Tides Foundation and George Soros are the king puppet masters and that they are getting ready to stage a new Oklahoma City.
[00:28:06.293 --> 00:28:07.414]  Man, he is bold!
[00:28:07.814 --> 00:28:16.560]  He went out to 3 million viewers yesterday, I looked up the ratings this morning, 3 million viewers, on his radio show, 10 million listeners, that's 13 million people,
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.663]  And he talked about elements of the government blowing up another Oklahoma City.
[00:28:21.983 --> 00:28:23.284]  That is news.
[00:28:23.664 --> 00:28:24.945]  That is big.
[00:28:26.145 --> 00:28:32.089]  As I've been telling you all week, even if a lot of these Tea Party people aren't for real that just got into office, they've been forced to act like us.
[00:28:32.589 --> 00:28:34.430]  It shows our information's down mainline.
[00:28:35.291 --> 00:28:37.192]  And that is half the battle, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:39.113 --> 00:28:42.195]  So this is very, very exciting.
[00:28:42.215 --> 00:28:53.443]  You notice he played the very video clip that we played last week and then again on Monday of Clintonite says Obama needs Oklahoma City bombing to reconnect with the American people.
[00:28:53.483 --> 00:28:56.845]  Democratic operative Mark Penn said that on national television.
[00:28:56.885 --> 00:28:58.847]  Beck played the exact same YouTube clip we played.
[00:29:00.011 --> 00:29:26.357]  five six days later uh... we wrote the stories of course about this uh... we wrote the original story talking about the financial times of london where robert shapiro said without an oklahoma city or without a new nine eleven that's in the article obama faces growing credibility crisis without that they're done absolutely glenn welcome to the club they think you're so stupid i'm so stupid our listeners and viewers are so stupid
[00:29:27.777 --> 00:29:45.464]  That they can openly talk about how great terrorism would be for them, and you see them getting ready to set you up, me up, and many others, and you're doing the only thing you can, coming out and telling the truth, or they're going to pin you with the bombing, the mass shooting, the airline hijackings, that they're going to blame on white Al-Qaeda.
[00:29:45.964 --> 00:29:48.305]  This is big, big, big news.
[00:29:49.845 --> 00:29:50.766]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.246 --> 00:29:52.846]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.787 --> 00:29:56.468]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.506 --> 00:30:14.978]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:30:15.979 --> 00:30:19.662]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:20.666 --> 00:30:32.677]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:30:33.438 --> 00:30:40.704]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:30:41.385 --> 00:30:50.998]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:55.023]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:30:55.684 --> 00:30:58.808]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:30:59.409 --> 00:31:03.652]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:03.973 --> 00:31:04.573]  Number one.
[00:31:04.893 --> 00:31:08.036]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.316 --> 00:31:08.877]  Number two.
[00:31:09.177 --> 00:31:13.721]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.061 --> 00:31:14.501]  It's true.
[00:31:14.801 --> 00:31:19.365]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:19.685 --> 00:31:20.226]  Number three.
[00:31:20.506 --> 00:31:23.789]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.089 --> 00:31:27.792]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:27.992 --> 00:31:28.533]  Number 4.
[00:31:28.793 --> 00:31:31.155]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.555 --> 00:31:34.919]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.219 --> 00:31:35.759]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:39.943]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.163 --> 00:31:44.928]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.208 --> 00:31:49.229]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:50.950]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.251]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:31:53.431 --> 00:31:55.772]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:31:59.545 --> 00:32:02.849]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:32:03.129 --> 00:32:04.190]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:08.615]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:32:08.815 --> 00:32:14.481]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:32:14.762 --> 00:32:16.744]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:32:16.924 --> 00:32:19.587]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:32:19.927 --> 00:32:26.232]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:32:26.432 --> 00:32:28.233]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:32:28.633 --> 00:32:33.717]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:32:33.977 --> 00:32:38.981]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:32:39.261 --> 00:32:44.445]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:32:44.625 --> 00:32:47.608]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:32:47.808 --> 00:32:53.372]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:32:53.612 --> 00:32:58.136]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:33:04.602 --> 00:33:10.146]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:10.627 --> 00:33:13.169]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:16.078 --> 00:33:22.623]  It's scary to be having this big of an effect thanks to our millions of Patriot hardcore activist listeners.
[00:33:22.663 --> 00:33:24.225]  That's the power of this broadcast.
[00:33:25.065 --> 00:33:31.851]  That's why Rick Perry last year told a Fox News executive that he's worried about Ron Paul and Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.591 --> 00:33:33.953]  Now, of course, Rand Paul.
[00:33:33.993 --> 00:33:35.374]  They're scared of any real Patriot.
[00:33:37.238 --> 00:33:40.780]  They're scared because we're showing people reality.
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.541]  We're getting people to face the facts.
[00:33:43.182 --> 00:33:52.487]  And if the New World Order loses its stage terror card, they lose a lot of their power to be able to stage events and pose as our saviors.
[00:33:53.648 --> 00:33:58.711]  And it is such a big deal to have Glenn Beck come out
[00:34:01.525 --> 00:34:03.867]  And say, government preparing to stage terror.
[00:34:03.907 --> 00:34:07.989]  Glenn Beck, government preparing to stage terror.
[00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:10.951]  And that's the PrisonPlanet.com headline.
[00:34:10.971 --> 00:34:20.477]  I want to get Curt Nemo on the Infowars version to say, Glenn Beck, government preparing to stage Oklahoma City.
[00:34:21.158 --> 00:34:22.498]  Style attack, or something like that.
[00:34:23.339 --> 00:34:26.301]  But the point is, this is so big.
[00:34:28.649 --> 00:34:33.153]  Because now, how is Glenn going to make fun of people that talk about 9-11 being an inside job?
[00:34:33.173 --> 00:34:34.434]  How are you going to do that, Glenn?
[00:34:34.774 --> 00:34:42.701]  I know it's a religion to hate Muslims, but then the government's always protecting radical Muslims, and Anwar al-Awlaki, Fox News reports, is hanging out secretly at the Pentagon.
[00:34:43.142 --> 00:34:44.263]  These are the real issues.
[00:34:44.303 --> 00:34:45.544]  I mean, I'm not supposed to cover that?
[00:34:46.265 --> 00:34:51.589]  I'm supposed to go, oh no, our government's not involved, when all the evidence is, our government was taken over by offshore interest.
[00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:56.394]  The same big mega-banks that finance George Soros, who attacks you and I, Glenn, every day.
[00:34:58.564 --> 00:35:06.288]  By the way, there is another attack piece in the news from Media Matters.
[00:35:06.308 --> 00:35:13.972]  They're not only attacking Glenn for talking about government-sponsored terror, they've got another report there.
[00:35:17.934 --> 00:35:24.217]  And it says, Fox News' most prominent birther interviewed by nation's most prominent truther.
[00:35:24.758 --> 00:35:26.579]  It talks about Lou Dobbs coming back on the show.
[00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:31.914]  And it says, apparently not put off by Jones' promotion of things like 9-11 truthism.
[00:35:31.974 --> 00:35:33.896]  Dobbs joined him on his radio show last month.
[00:35:33.956 --> 00:35:41.524]  Jones introduced Dobbs by saying he was shown the door by CNN because he wouldn't compromise on Barry Sotero and the open borders.
[00:35:41.884 --> 00:35:48.631]  As Jones' website explains, Barry Sotero is the birther code word and instrumental to exposing important keys to Obama's true history.
[00:35:49.412 --> 00:35:54.254]  Far from being a contiguous interview, the two spoke mostly in harmony about things like One World Government.
[00:35:54.294 --> 00:35:59.497]  During the interview, Jones even correctly predicted that Dobbs would end up at the Fox Business Network.
[00:36:01.118 --> 00:36:04.820]  Well, I correctly predicted it because I already knew it from inside Fox.
[00:36:05.782 --> 00:36:09.925]  Hey, Glenn, I got people inside Mercury.
[00:36:10.906 --> 00:36:12.968]  I got people inside Fox.
[00:36:13.088 --> 00:36:14.549]  I know exactly what you're doing.
[00:36:14.869 --> 00:36:19.974]  I can pick the telephone up anytime I want, and I'm so busy I don't do it very often, and find out exactly what you're doing.
[00:36:20.854 --> 00:36:24.898]  Now, the good news is, buddy, you are getting hardcore.
[00:36:25.018 --> 00:36:29.902]  And you know you had to, because they're getting ready to blow something up and blame it on you, buddy, along with myself and others.
[00:36:31.383 --> 00:36:33.665]  And they're so arrogant, they're all over TV bragging about it.
[00:36:33.685 --> 00:36:35.186]  We got Tyrell Ventura coming up.
[00:36:35.506 --> 00:36:45.174]  I want to play this little five-minute video, but later when Max Keiser's on, I'm getting into the economy, I'm getting into who the real puppet masters are, since Beck didn't tell you, he told you it was Soros.
[00:36:45.394 --> 00:36:50.558]  That's a guy way down the totem pole, on the left wing of this buzzard, this carrion crow.
[00:36:51.772 --> 00:36:54.053]  This Phil Theater that is the New World Order.
[00:36:54.073 --> 00:36:57.194]  We're going to go over all of this, but this is big news.
[00:36:57.234 --> 00:36:58.354]  Get this out to everybody.
[00:36:58.394 --> 00:37:03.595]  Now, I want to do a Google search term today because this is groundbreaking big news.
[00:37:04.115 --> 00:37:04.836]  FEMA camps.
[00:37:05.276 --> 00:37:10.797]  F-E-M-A is one word, is the acronym for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
[00:37:11.157 --> 00:37:12.078]  FEMA camps.
[00:37:12.138 --> 00:37:13.058]  Those are the two words.
[00:37:13.358 --> 00:37:20.380]  Let's send it to number one so people read this article by Aaron Dykes in the video, breaking down the real FEMA camps and how they're confirmed.
[00:37:21.613 --> 00:37:23.914]  FEMA camps is the search term.
[00:37:24.274 --> 00:37:25.515]  FEMA camps.
[00:37:26.535 --> 00:37:28.256]  F-E-M-A camps.
[00:37:28.496 --> 00:37:29.277]  FEMA camps.
[00:37:29.677 --> 00:37:31.157]  That's the search term today.
[00:37:32.558 --> 00:37:33.659]  And I also want to
[00:37:36.638 --> 00:37:42.002]  Make the search term Stage Terror number two, so it leads into this article about Glenn Beck.
[00:37:42.302 --> 00:37:44.724]  Stage Terror and FEMA camps.
[00:37:44.824 --> 00:37:45.845]  Those are the search terms.
[00:37:45.885 --> 00:37:48.066]  Stage Terror and FEMA camps.
[00:37:48.126 --> 00:37:50.088]  We've done Stage Terror before, so they may try to block that.
[00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:51.869]  So enter it into Google over and over again.
[00:37:51.909 --> 00:37:53.350]  FEMA camps is one, Stage Terror is the other.
[00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:58.293]  Now here's this video where I break down some of what you're about to hear from Tyrell Ventura, coming up in five minutes.
[00:37:58.333 --> 00:37:58.914]  Here's the video.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.541]  My friends, we've got a big announcement for you.
[00:38:08.701 --> 00:38:16.044]  You know, there's been a lot of controversies dealing with FEMA camps, concentration camps, internment camps inside the United States.
[00:38:17.284 --> 00:38:19.105]  Well, a few months ago, I was
[00:38:20.993 --> 00:38:25.537]  Involved in the production of True TV's Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[00:38:26.017 --> 00:38:28.579]  And we traveled to Georgia, Texas, you name it.
[00:38:29.219 --> 00:38:36.645]  And confirmed the existence of real FEMA camps and how they tie in to the entire continuity of government system.
[00:38:37.426 --> 00:38:40.248]  And how these camps are being planned for the American people.
[00:38:40.909 --> 00:38:42.310]  I have been authorized
[00:38:43.237 --> 00:38:47.802]  To give you a sneak peek view into what's going to be covered on this show.
[00:38:48.363 --> 00:38:51.726]  You have no idea what people are doing right under your nose.
[00:38:51.926 --> 00:38:53.908]  What in the hell is that?
[00:38:54.009 --> 00:38:56.832]  This is the show they don't want you to see.
[00:38:57.012 --> 00:38:58.193]  Conspiracy Theory.
[00:38:58.253 --> 00:39:00.596]  You won't believe what you don't know.
[00:39:00.656 --> 00:39:02.157]  The all new season on TruTV.
[00:39:02.978 --> 00:39:06.020]  This is groundbreaking information.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:14.864]  They go and talk to two different members of Congress who authored the Emergency Centers Act that creates these camps for the American people.
[00:39:15.585 --> 00:39:16.985]  And they got bizarre answers.
[00:39:17.205 --> 00:39:18.986]  One congressman ducked questions.
[00:39:19.026 --> 00:39:24.009]  The other said, well, these are camps for happy children.
[00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:28.011]  You cannot make up the craziness of this.
[00:39:28.791 --> 00:39:34.435]  Ventura and I went out to Georgia, outside Atlanta, to the famous FEMA coffin facility.
[00:39:34.956 --> 00:39:42.441]  As we show up, we're told by locals that scores of 18-wheelers had been there taking the plastic coffin liners away.
[00:39:43.041 --> 00:39:44.963]  But we caught some of them still in place.
[00:39:45.723 --> 00:40:03.941]  This is an amazing documentary, and it also gets into former FBI agents and whistleblowers talking about the Continental Government Program, how the threat fusion centers are federalizing local police and are spying on the American people for their political views.
[00:40:04.601 --> 00:40:08.605]  You know, over a year ago, I was sent my law enforcement, the Homeland Security Secret Reports.
[00:40:09.602 --> 00:40:18.886]  Where they admit 95% or more of the surveillance and training for homeland security deals with conservatives, libertarians, gun owners.
[00:40:19.366 --> 00:40:28.269]  This has nothing to do with turbaned men in caves and everything to do with dominating and controlling the American people as we go into this contrived depression.
[00:40:28.649 --> 00:40:34.652]  World government is here and they've used terrorism as the pretext to put this straitjacket in place.
[00:40:35.812 --> 00:40:40.617]  Of all the episodes they've produced in the second season, they are the most proud of this one.
[00:40:41.118 --> 00:40:48.246]  And they are blown away by what they've discovered, and so am I. It's on TruTV, coming up this Friday, 9 p.m.
[00:40:48.286 --> 00:40:49.988]  Central, 10 p.m.
[00:40:50.068 --> 00:40:50.368]  Eastern.
[00:40:51.417 --> 00:40:53.079]  Tell everyone you know about this.
[00:40:53.199 --> 00:40:56.724]  Get them to tune in and to take notes and research this information.
[00:40:57.124 --> 00:40:59.447]  This has never been on television before.
[00:40:59.928 --> 00:41:01.309]  This is bombshell.
[00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:03.232]  FEMA camps are real.
[00:41:03.592 --> 00:41:04.533]  They are confirmed.
[00:41:05.014 --> 00:41:06.376]  These things are going up everywhere.
[00:41:06.716 --> 00:41:16.599]  You go back to Rex 84 in 1986 and congressional hearings where they admitted they were setting up camps in the name of illegal aliens, but really they're for the American people.
[00:41:17.019 --> 00:41:21.760]  This is a very, very deep program and groundbreaking information.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:26.262]  So tell everyone you know, the FEMA camps have been exposed.
[00:41:26.682 --> 00:41:27.862]  Conspiracy theories.
[00:41:27.922 --> 00:41:30.103]  You won't believe what you don't know.
[00:41:30.123 --> 00:41:32.043]  The all new season on TruTV.
[00:41:32.603 --> 00:41:33.944]  By exposing these camps,
[00:41:34.878 --> 00:41:38.259]  We can stop this Hitlerian takeover of our country.
[00:41:38.739 --> 00:41:47.182]  Even in 1944 and 1945 in the United States and England, it was called a conspiracy theory to talk about Hitler and death camps.
[00:41:48.042 --> 00:41:52.063]  Imagine if people in the mid-1930s would have exposed this evil.
[00:41:52.524 --> 00:41:54.724]  Hitler couldn't have gotten away with what he did.
[00:41:55.124 --> 00:41:58.025]  We're here, catching them with their pants down.
[00:41:58.865 --> 00:41:59.286]  True TV.
[00:42:00.906 --> 00:42:01.227]  9 p.m.
[00:42:01.287 --> 00:42:02.267]  Central, 10 p.m.
[00:42:02.327 --> 00:42:02.688]  Eastern.
[00:42:03.048 --> 00:42:04.769]  Details at Infowars.com.
[00:42:06.191 --> 00:42:08.412]  I am very proud to be involved with this production.
[00:42:08.432 --> 00:42:14.097]  This is powerful, groundbreaking developments that is really scaring the establishment.
[00:42:14.557 --> 00:42:20.041]  Ventura, myself, and others have been through all sorts of harassment bringing you this information.
[00:42:20.642 --> 00:42:22.964]  I just hope that it even makes it on TV.
[00:42:23.424 --> 00:42:23.945]  We are
[00:42:24.605 --> 00:42:28.510]  Pinching ourselves that we're not dreaming that this is actually going to make it on television.
[00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:30.072]  So we're crossing our fingers.
[00:42:30.693 --> 00:42:31.453]  We'll be watching.
[00:42:31.494 --> 00:42:32.294]  I hope you're watching.
[00:42:32.355 --> 00:42:34.898]  Coming up this Friday night, 9 p.m.
[00:42:34.938 --> 00:42:36.380]  Central, TruTV.
[00:42:43.302 --> 00:42:45.183]  Premier's Friday, November 12th, 10 p.m.
[00:42:45.243 --> 00:42:46.603]  Eastern, 9 p.m.
[00:42:46.643 --> 00:42:47.043]  Central.
[00:42:47.183 --> 00:42:47.543]  Okay.
[00:42:48.244 --> 00:42:54.426]  We're doing the search term today because I went with Governor Ventura to Homeland Security facilities set up for families.
[00:42:54.926 --> 00:42:59.087]  They went and confronted two different congressmen who wrote the legislation to formalize it.
[00:43:00.248 --> 00:43:04.169]  They talked to a former FBI agent about the Threat Fusion Center spying on the citizens.
[00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:06.910]  The MIAC report and Homeland Security reports that we broke.
[00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:08.911]  Citizen activists that are fighting it.
[00:43:09.731 --> 00:43:16.176]  This is the first time ever, and I've talked to a lot of the crew that they believe it's the most powerful, if not the second most powerful.
[00:43:16.196 --> 00:43:20.359]  They got the big JFK episode with the deathbed confession and E. Howard Hunt coming up next week.
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.602]  This is powerful, powerful info.
[00:43:23.682 --> 00:43:25.003]  Tomorrow night, 9 p.m.
[00:43:25.023 --> 00:43:26.304]  Central, 10 p.m.
[00:43:26.364 --> 00:43:27.485]  Eastern, TruTV.
[00:43:27.985 --> 00:43:32.429]  And we've got links to TruTV up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:34.991]  Everything is starting to come out right now.
[00:43:35.191 --> 00:43:38.572]  Other incredible news coming up after Tyrell leaves us in about 45 minutes.
[00:43:39.032 --> 00:43:41.053]  Nation states are dead, EU chief says.
[00:43:41.473 --> 00:43:44.234]  The belief that countries can stand alone is a lie and an illusion.
[00:43:44.654 --> 00:43:47.015]  This is the same guy saying world government is now here.
[00:43:47.735 --> 00:43:49.736]  They have destroyed the world currencies by design.
[00:43:49.776 --> 00:43:50.856]  It is all happening.
[00:43:50.916 --> 00:43:53.277]  Max Keiser coming up to discuss that.
[00:43:53.757 --> 00:43:58.719]  Okay, going now to Tyrell Ventura, who's made several films in his own right, documentaries.
[00:43:59.379 --> 00:44:01.021]  Thank you for having me back, Alex.
[00:44:01.041 --> 00:44:03.204]  It's always a pleasure being on your show.
[00:44:12.054 --> 00:44:13.335]  So much is going on.
[00:44:13.555 --> 00:44:17.178]  So much is happening.
[00:44:18.179 --> 00:44:20.801]  I've got the bullet points here that we're able to reveal.
[00:44:20.821 --> 00:44:22.382]  I just want to read these on air.
[00:44:22.722 --> 00:44:28.767]  Thousands of FEMA coffins removed from Georgia's storage yards minutes before Jesse Ventura and myself arrived to film them.
[00:44:29.327 --> 00:44:33.250]  Congressman who co-sponsored authorizing FEMA camp says U.S.
[00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.792]  government centers quote have happy children in them.
[00:44:35.812 --> 00:44:36.633]  You can't make that up.
[00:44:37.293 --> 00:44:38.714]  FEMA camp bill co-sponsored.
[00:44:39.855 --> 00:44:45.680]  Repeatedly ducks TV cameras, TV crew finds locked doors, double fences, escape warnings, and Homeland Security residential facility.
[00:44:46.121 --> 00:44:47.001]  I was there with your father.
[00:44:47.702 --> 00:44:51.085]  Officials will neither confirm nor deny American citizens are being held.
[00:44:51.445 --> 00:44:56.090]  Fusion centers are popping up all over America to spy on ordinary citizens, says ex-FBI whistleblower.
[00:44:56.570 --> 00:45:01.434]  Fusion Center spokesman Lance Clem admits that domestic intelligence gathering centers have no oversight.
[00:45:01.935 --> 00:45:03.436]  We police ourselves, says Clem.
[00:45:03.716 --> 00:45:05.158]  This is groundbreaking, Tyrell.
[00:45:06.147 --> 00:45:25.206]  It's truly amazing, Alex, that we were, I mean, I'm so excited to get this episode on the air because I truly, as far as I know, this is the first time anything in mainstream media has really presented an honest, real look at this kind of problem, the diffusion centers and FEMA camps and all that's coming.
[00:45:25.686 --> 00:45:40.511]  You know, they're popping up around the country and then I'm excited as hell to have it on TV and I thank you again for all your help in helping us get this episode put together and then get it on the air for people to see and then people realize that this is reality.
[00:45:40.551 --> 00:45:42.091]  This is not fiction.
[00:45:42.131 --> 00:45:45.873]  This is not us pontificating and what could be.
[00:45:45.933 --> 00:45:46.813]  These things exist.
[00:45:46.873 --> 00:45:48.553]  We went and filmed them with our cameras.
[00:45:48.954 --> 00:45:49.834]  You know, they're real.
[00:45:49.874 --> 00:45:52.135]  They're out there and it's chilling.
[00:45:52.455 --> 00:45:53.235]  It's very chilling.
[00:45:54.153 --> 00:45:54.413]  It is.
[00:45:54.473 --> 00:45:59.658]  I traveled quite a bit with your father, Governor Ventura, and of course he traveled even a lot more.
[00:46:00.079 --> 00:46:07.045]  Where do we start giving people a prelude to what's coming up tomorrow night?
[00:46:07.065 --> 00:46:10.669]  I mean, what do you think of the hour-long episode as the most powerful info?
[00:46:11.846 --> 00:46:26.723]  I think truly the most valuable info that really struck me when I was watching it is not only seeing them live in person, but also just the simple fact that the two congressmen that we confronted about the bill
[00:46:28.044 --> 00:46:30.186]  I don't even think they had any idea it was in there.
[00:46:30.306 --> 00:46:35.409]  They were just told to co-sponsor this bill, and follow orders, and do your job.
[00:46:35.429 --> 00:46:38.250]  They had no clue that the thing was even in the bill.
[00:46:38.591 --> 00:46:43.694]  It just shows that they used the ineptness, and frankly,
[00:46:48.896 --> 00:47:15.467]  Well, I've made three films on FEMA camps, previous to my fourth film, and everything we talked about was reverse-engineered from parts that have been declassified of RECS 84 and the type of camps our government set up in third-world countries they control, but we said that they are old sports stadiums.
[00:47:16.027 --> 00:47:19.448]  And we've since been to sports stadiums in Chicago where they train to put citizens in them.
[00:47:19.908 --> 00:47:21.429]  We knew that they were prisons.
[00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:27.711]  We knew that it was, you know, the cover was for immigrants, but it was really for everybody.
[00:47:27.731 --> 00:47:29.611]  That even came out in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:47:29.971 --> 00:47:34.133]  But then to read the Emergency Centers Act, it states
[00:47:34.813 --> 00:47:38.614]  You know, that it's for families, it's for medical care, it's for homeless people.
[00:47:38.974 --> 00:47:40.755]  You know, we're going to lock you up at night.
[00:47:41.075 --> 00:47:42.996]  And we've got to have these all over the country.
[00:47:43.016 --> 00:47:46.657]  I mean, just like in Nazi Germany.
[00:47:46.777 --> 00:47:50.678]  And how they use these camps is completely at the discretion of Homeland Security.
[00:47:50.698 --> 00:47:52.798]  It doesn't say what they can't use them for.
[00:47:52.838 --> 00:47:55.759]  It doesn't say what they're supposed to be used for.
[00:47:55.779 --> 00:47:58.480]  It just says completely at the discretion of Homeland Security.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.881]  And that's truly frightening.
[00:48:01.201 --> 00:48:06.812]  And that's where I was going with it is that in Nazi Germany they didn't say we're taking you to a slave camp or a death camp.
[00:48:07.373 --> 00:48:10.318]  They said we're taking you to a living center to be safe.
[00:48:11.772 --> 00:48:12.913]  Yeah, a happy fun village.
[00:48:14.433 --> 00:48:16.874]  You know, it's horrible.
[00:48:17.574 --> 00:48:21.796]  It truly, it shocked my father, it shocked me.
[00:48:22.296 --> 00:48:29.759]  You know, we'd always heard about these things and, you know, you don't really, you can't, you don't get a good feeling until you're standing in front of one.
[00:48:30.139 --> 00:48:34.301]  And then you see it, you know, and you realize, my God, this is real, this is happening right now.
[00:48:34.521 --> 00:48:37.342]  Well Tyrell... And, you know, it's extraordinary.
[00:48:37.958 --> 00:48:38.198]  It is.
[00:48:38.238 --> 00:48:42.499]  What the mainstream media has done is they cherry pick straw men.
[00:48:42.779 --> 00:48:47.120]  They go out and show camps that aren't camps and then say no camps are real.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:58.602]  That'd be like if I went to Antarctica and said I'm looking for giraffes and there are no giraffes in Antarctica on the bottom of the world so giraffes don't exist.
[00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:04.783]  Or if I went to the Sahara Desert and said I don't see any penguins so penguins don't exist.
[00:49:04.823 --> 00:49:05.843]  Well I would need to go
[00:49:06.423 --> 00:49:14.305]  You know, to Antarctica to find penguins, I need to go to Africa to find a giraffe or an African elephant or a lion.
[00:49:14.705 --> 00:49:15.905]  So that's how they do this.
[00:49:15.945 --> 00:49:23.807]  You guys go to real, admitted FEMA camp emergency centers where they admit it could be for citizens, political dissidents, illegal aliens.
[00:49:23.827 --> 00:49:25.287]  I mean, it doesn't matter.
[00:49:25.467 --> 00:49:26.327]  It's admitted.
[00:49:26.767 --> 00:49:28.608]  And this is so groundbreaking.
[00:49:29.688 --> 00:49:33.030]  Look, I mean, I don't know... You can see the chain, too.
[00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:58.227]  I mean, you can see how it's gonna go down, and I hopefully, I mean, I believe we did a really good job of presenting this on the show, is that you see the chain and how it all connects together, you know, with fusion centers to gather all the information and find out who the people are that they don't like, find the distance, find, you know, your gun owners, your activists, you know, they compile all that information, and then they use that information then to spread out, so when the takeover does happen,
[00:49:59.068 --> 00:50:02.171]  Uh, you know, under the guise of a national security threat or whatever.
[00:50:02.191 --> 00:50:04.834]  Uh, they have that information sitting there.
[00:50:04.874 --> 00:50:07.616]  They feed it out to the military, police, things like that.
[00:50:07.656 --> 00:50:09.879]  And then they have the camps built for where they're going to send you.
[00:50:09.899 --> 00:50:11.420]  And you can see the direct line.
[00:50:11.901 --> 00:50:17.547]  And it's shocking to me that... Well, no, it's not shocking to me that the media ignores this.
[00:50:18.167 --> 00:50:31.856]  ...brings up straw man arguments because, A, half of your, you know, media today, if not more than half, are completely just follow the party line, I don't want to get fired, you know, weak, you know, journalists who, you know, I don't, I wouldn't even call them journalists.
[00:50:32.597 --> 00:50:38.721]  And the other half are probably, you know, in on it with the status quo and the corporate influence and then the true, you know, corporate fascism that we live in.
[00:50:39.625 --> 00:50:41.547]  Powerful statements, all true.
[00:50:42.007 --> 00:50:43.289]  Tyrell Ventura, our guest.
[00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:45.251]  Let's come back and talk more about this episode.
[00:50:45.291 --> 00:50:47.873]  This is groundbreaking information.
[00:50:48.914 --> 00:50:49.875]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:50:49.915 --> 00:50:52.037]  The search term today is FEMA camps.
[00:50:52.478 --> 00:50:53.979]  Type it into Google over and over again.
[00:50:54.019 --> 00:50:55.060]  Let's make it number one.

[00:51:59.451 --> 00:52:04.315]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:04.415 --> 00:52:05.195]  What have we got?
[00:52:05.415 --> 00:52:07.537]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:07.857 --> 00:52:08.618]  A republic.
[00:52:08.858 --> 00:52:11.440]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.421]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:13.782 --> 00:52:15.683]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:15.803 --> 00:52:17.084]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:17.484 --> 00:52:18.585]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:18.805 --> 00:52:19.206]  Children?
[00:52:19.406 --> 00:52:20.206]  Our education?
[00:52:20.527 --> 00:52:21.167]  Our money?
[00:52:21.367 --> 00:52:25.010]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:29.012]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:29.072 --> 00:52:30.012]  You're being warned.
[00:52:30.332 --> 00:52:31.173]  We have the facts.
[00:52:31.373 --> 00:52:32.473]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:32.533 --> 00:52:33.414]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:33.434 --> 00:52:34.274]  We have common law.
[00:52:34.314 --> 00:52:36.575]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:36.835 --> 00:52:40.617]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:40.717 --> 00:52:45.523]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:45.683 --> 00:52:47.065]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:47.185 --> 00:52:48.026]  Don't tread on me.

[00:52:59.144 --> 00:53:01.505]  Are the threats of a biological attack to the U.S.
[00:53:01.585 --> 00:53:01.885]  real?
[00:53:02.025 --> 00:53:06.808]  If biological warfare is real, what should I know before it happens to protect my family?
[00:53:07.008 --> 00:53:15.372]  The answers to the unthinkable are inside a new book by Christian patriot and author Sam Adams, Pale Horse, How to Survive a Chemical or Biological Attack.
[00:53:15.712 --> 00:53:34.544]  Inside what's been called the must-have manual for surviving the attack and mass panic that will follow, you will learn what the actual biological and chemical threats are, how to respond to events that are almost certain to happen, what the government's response is likely to be, how some will take advantage of the chaos, and exactly how you should prepare to get pale horse

[00:54:10.882 --> 00:54:11.962]  We are back live.
[00:54:11.982 --> 00:54:15.643]  Tyrell Ventura with us for about another 40 minutes, then Max Keiser.
[00:54:16.043 --> 00:54:21.985]  In the last 20 minutes of the show today, I will reveal the real Puppet Masters, and it's not George Soros.
[00:54:22.905 --> 00:54:26.426]  Glenn Beck now says the government may stage an Oklahoma City to blame it on patriots.
[00:54:26.806 --> 00:54:27.846]  Welcome to the club, Glenn.
[00:54:27.866 --> 00:54:29.187]  You're finally starting to figure it out.
[00:54:29.627 --> 00:54:32.027]  That's coming up in the last 20 minutes of the transmission today.
[00:54:32.387 --> 00:54:33.828]  All the huge economic developments.
[00:54:34.208 --> 00:54:35.788]  I want to tell just a brief story here.
[00:54:35.968 --> 00:54:38.889]  As a consultant on conspiracy theory last season and this season,
[00:54:40.732 --> 00:54:47.055]  I mean, I remember meeting with Ventura, giving him documents, meeting with Tyrell, and Ventura was like, yeah, global warming might be real.
[00:54:47.075 --> 00:54:51.217]  I mean, they went into this, and those war room scenes are real, having real arguments.
[00:54:51.237 --> 00:54:52.577]  I mean, that's really what their views are.
[00:54:53.118 --> 00:54:56.719]  And Ventura found it was a fraud at the end of the multi-month investigation.
[00:54:56.979 --> 00:54:58.440]  They spend a lot of money on this production.
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:00.001]  They go all over the place.
[00:55:00.803 --> 00:55:02.323]  Uh, and it's the same thing with FEMA camps.
[00:55:03.044 --> 00:55:10.845]  I remember talking to Jesse Ventura, uh, you know, it was probably six months ago, and talking to the rest of their crew, and they're like, okay, alright.
[00:55:11.166 --> 00:55:15.066]  They're going through all the FEMA camps, they're finding the straw men, fake stuff, they're finding real things.
[00:55:15.447 --> 00:55:18.387]  They're like, we'll see, and then they're totally blown away.
[00:55:18.687 --> 00:55:20.928]  So this is a real investigation.
[00:55:22.228 --> 00:55:26.310]  And for me, the information is what is sensational, you know, in it.
[00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:31.031]  And tomorrow, I believe, is the most powerful info.
[00:55:31.071 --> 00:55:36.293]  I believe the global warming was the biggest last year and the population reduction episode I was in as well.
[00:55:36.713 --> 00:55:42.875]  This, I mean, Tyrell, other than a deathbed confession by one of the main commanders of killing Kennedy next week,
[00:55:44.375 --> 00:55:46.075]  Which is new to television, not to this show.
[00:55:46.095 --> 00:55:50.956]  I mean, I can't think of any episode you guys have put together that is more groundbreaking.
[00:55:51.016 --> 00:55:51.756]  Do you agree with that?
[00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:53.857]  Oh, I completely do.
[00:55:53.917 --> 00:56:08.699]  I mean, each episode we do, we try to present something that we know that, you know, people who aren't paying attention to, you know, non-mainstream media programming, you know, for people that don't watch your show or that don't follow this, you know, that's our target audience.
[00:56:08.759 --> 00:56:12.540]  We're trying to shake those people that don't normally pay attention to these things and
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.961]  Yeah, no, this show is amazing.
[00:56:17.021 --> 00:56:19.022]  It's truly, truly extraordinary.
[00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:21.062]  I think it's one of the best shows this season.
[00:56:21.143 --> 00:56:30.646]  I mean, I think all of our shows this season, we try to break a story that the normal people in their daily lives don't hear and need to hear.
[00:56:31.406 --> 00:56:35.027]  And that's what's so great about TruTV is being able to give us that outlet.
[00:56:35.888 --> 00:56:59.747]  Uh, right on, you know, right on satellite TV, right on cable, right, where some guy's at home flipping channels and he stops and he starts watching and, you know, and he can see the truth or, you know, he can get information, hopefully, that then he will take and go and start, you know, listening to your show or go and start, you know, doing his own independent research and realizing that, you know, yeah, there's, you know, all the smoke out there.
[00:56:59.787 --> 00:57:01.048]  We're showing you where the fires are.
[00:57:01.994 --> 00:57:13.177]  Well, I mean, the government, just this year I sent a crew up to Chicago and they, with foreign Polish and other troops, they trained to put Americans in the sports stadium and admitted that it was for the United States.
[00:57:13.557 --> 00:57:15.117]  So a lot of this is hidden in plain view.
[00:57:15.157 --> 00:57:18.478]  They've had gun confiscation drills in Arcadia, Iowa.
[00:57:19.139 --> 00:57:20.779]  And we saw what happened in New Orleans.
[00:57:21.079 --> 00:57:26.160]  We have the clergy response teams and InfraGard and, you know, so much of this that is covered.
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:27.801]  That's why the search term today
[00:57:28.761 --> 00:57:41.825]  Is FEMA camps, folks, so people find the Infowars.com story that has all the proof, that has the link to the TV show, so people who aren't aware of this can find out, yes, this is real, yes, this is going on.
[00:57:41.965 --> 00:57:45.006]  And all of these different cover-ups are falling.
[00:57:45.406 --> 00:57:49.187]  For years, they've been doing enhanced pat-downs where they squeeze breasts and genitals.
[00:57:49.547 --> 00:57:51.568]  Now it's major national news.
[00:57:52.328 --> 00:57:57.894]  And, you know, even CBS News says backlash grows over TSA naked strip searches.
[00:57:58.435 --> 00:58:05.203]  I mean, folks are getting angry right now, and the illusions, the iron curtain of disinformation has fallen.
[00:58:06.246 --> 00:58:06.866]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:06.946 --> 00:58:18.772]  And the key to understand, too, is that, you know, the people that are doing, you know, the people that are, like, you know, in charge of these facilities and things like that, a lot of them have no idea what their facility is truly going to be used for.
[00:58:18.812 --> 00:58:24.696]  You know, they just are, you know, government employees earning a paycheck and not aware of the bigger picture, much like the rest of us.
[00:58:25.316 --> 00:58:35.201]  And so, you know, or your TSA person who is patting you down, he's not aware of the repercussions of what he's doing and what he's making normal and what you're supposed to just take.
[00:58:35.461 --> 00:58:36.441]  Tyrell, great points.
[00:58:36.481 --> 00:58:37.041]  Gotta go to break.
[00:58:37.081 --> 00:58:37.622]  Back in 70 seconds.

[00:59:01.947 --> 00:59:03.408]  There's a place down in Tennessee

[00:59:54.999 --> 00:59:57.841]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:05.028]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.688 --> 01:00:06.749]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:08.631]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:08.651 --> 01:00:10.032]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.792 --> 01:00:11.733]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.334 --> 01:00:15.957]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.537 --> 01:00:20.621]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.722 --> 01:00:32.204]  Tyrell Ventura, the son of Jesse Ventura, is our guest.
[01:00:32.244 --> 01:00:46.553]  He's worked in television and film for many years and worked on the last season and of course worked deeply on the second season and the most powerful episode that most of the crew agrees is the most informative and earth-shaking
[01:00:47.854 --> 01:00:49.314]  Is there police state episode?
[01:00:49.995 --> 01:00:53.395]  And we've got an article bombshell FEMA camps confirmed.
[01:00:53.976 --> 01:00:56.576]  That's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:56.596 --> 01:00:58.357]  Please email the story out to everyone you know.
[01:00:58.857 --> 01:01:02.158]  It's full of documentation and links to the television show and the website.
[01:01:03.018 --> 01:01:06.199]  And we're also making it the number one search term today, FEMA camps.
[01:01:07.439 --> 01:01:12.483]  Tyrell, this is a short segment, but I want to walk through with you more of what's covered in the episode.
[01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:23.332]  We've kind of hit some of the key points here, but talk about fusion centers and the ex-FBI agent whistleblower you talked to that talked about how these are to basically spy on the American people.
[01:01:24.485 --> 01:01:25.225]  Yeah, essentially.
[01:01:25.285 --> 01:01:38.509]  I mean, these things are used, you know, under the cover of all we're trying to, you know, prevent terrorism and we're trying to, you know, coordinate information between all these agencies where, yes, okay, that is good and that's a wonderful thing.
[01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:41.750]  You know, we do want good, clean information and things not getting confused.
[01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:43.871]  Yeah, everybody's a terrorist!
[01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:14.611]  It's not just a right or a left thing.
[01:02:14.651 --> 01:02:21.252]  It's not like, oh, okay, well, this person's a very liberal activist or this person's a very conservative activist.
[01:02:21.652 --> 01:02:26.314]  They target activism in general, and they'll go after each side.
[01:02:26.334 --> 01:02:28.014]  I mean, this is not a right or left thing.
[01:02:28.034 --> 01:02:28.994]  No, no, it's secret.
[01:02:29.415 --> 01:02:38.297]  It's secret police, commissars, like out of the NKVD and Soviet Russia, trying to intimidate everybody and lying about
[01:02:38.817 --> 01:02:42.661]  Returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, anti-war activists.
[01:02:42.941 --> 01:02:51.289]  You know, it just came out a month ago that in several states, Israeli intelligence was hired by the government to spy on mainline tea parties.
[01:02:51.389 --> 01:02:52.771]  I mean, this is outrageous!
[01:02:53.846 --> 01:03:02.970]  It is outrageous, and they're using what probably initially the concept was a great idea, and they have turned it so ugly.
[01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:07.892]  And they've turned it into such a big brother, like you said, Gestapo.
[01:03:11.034 --> 01:03:21.781]  I'm just happy that we're able to get it on TV and so you can see this because the biggest thing is it's like, you know, you need oversight and things like this.
[01:03:21.841 --> 01:03:25.483]  Otherwise, they will be abused as we've seen.
[01:03:25.984 --> 01:03:34.769]  We talked to a young activist who was simply a Ron Paul supporter and a delegate for him, and she started being followed and she started being watched.
[01:03:34.809 --> 01:03:40.153]  And when she found out that it was all information going back to a fusion center, it changed her into an anti-fusion supporter.
[01:03:41.114 --> 01:03:41.794]  Absolutely.
[01:03:42.434 --> 01:03:44.315]  Let me read a quote.
[01:03:44.716 --> 01:03:45.516]  Let me read a quote here.
[01:03:58.003 --> 01:03:59.424]  It's designed to be abused.
[01:03:59.785 --> 01:04:01.266]  They're getting all this data.
[01:04:01.306 --> 01:04:04.828]  They're spying and they say, hey, nobody's allowed to have oversight.
[01:04:05.068 --> 01:04:07.991]  That's what the CIA did internationally.
[01:04:08.071 --> 01:04:10.332]  It's illegal to have the CIA involved domestically.
[01:04:10.552 --> 01:04:16.156]  But Tyrell, they now admit the CIA is involved in the fusion centers.
[01:04:16.977 --> 01:04:17.958]  Oh, I'm sure they are.
[01:04:17.978 --> 01:04:20.580]  I mean, the CIA is a hand in everything in this country.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:26.524]  I mean, my father saw it firsthand when he found out that there was a CIA agent embedded in state government.
[01:04:27.448 --> 01:04:48.260]  Uh, you know, I mean, they got their hand in everything in this country, and I think the reason that they have no oversight right now is for that way if they do get caught, if one of these fusion centers does get caught in mainstream media for being, you know, for grossly misusing it, they can simply fire the people involved at that fusion center, wash their hands, and say, oh, that was just a bad apple.
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:52.642]  Yeah, and then create that cover story, and create that cover story for what they're doing.
[01:04:52.702 --> 01:04:56.184]  Oh, you know, a few bad apples in the bunch, but ultimately we're protecting you.

[01:06:58.766 --> 01:07:02.989]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:03.589]  Number 1.
[01:07:04.229 --> 01:07:07.371]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:07.652 --> 01:07:08.212]  Number 2.
[01:07:08.512 --> 01:07:13.055]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:13.395 --> 01:07:13.836]  It's true.
[01:07:14.136 --> 01:07:18.699]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:19.019 --> 01:07:19.559]  Number 3.
[01:07:19.839 --> 01:07:23.121]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:23.422 --> 01:07:27.124]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:27.324 --> 01:07:27.865]  Number 4.
[01:07:28.125 --> 01:07:30.487]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:30.888 --> 01:07:34.271]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:34.572 --> 01:07:34.772]  Number 5.
[01:07:35.352 --> 01:07:39.277]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:39.497 --> 01:07:44.262]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:44.542 --> 01:07:48.569]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:08:12.386 --> 01:08:15.990]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:20.635]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.537 --> 01:08:35.525]  Tyrell Ventura, one of the producers on the hit television show, number one new show they've had last year and this year on True TV, premieres their new Police State episode, confirming FEMA cams tomorrow night, 9 p.m.
[01:08:35.565 --> 01:08:36.285]  Central, 10 p.m.
[01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:36.625]  Eastern.
[01:08:37.706 --> 01:08:41.207]  We've got a key article up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:41.287 --> 01:08:41.907]  Bombshell.
[01:08:41.947 --> 01:08:43.128]  FEMA camps confirmed.
[01:08:43.628 --> 01:08:46.049]  We're making the search term today.
[01:08:46.109 --> 01:08:47.789]  Please type it into Google over and over again.
[01:08:47.929 --> 01:08:48.729]  FEMA camps.
[01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:49.430]  There's two words.
[01:08:49.650 --> 01:08:51.430]  F-E-M-A camps.
[01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:52.070]  FEMA camps.
[01:08:52.551 --> 01:08:56.252]  We're also making stage terror the number one search term or number two.
[01:08:56.292 --> 01:08:56.512]  They'll...
[01:08:57.489 --> 01:08:59.230]  Go back and forth, it's number one and number two today.
[01:09:00.010 --> 01:09:03.972]  Stage terror, because Glenn Beck says government preparing to stage terror.
[01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:14.178]  What a big deal to have him come out, the guy demonizing anybody that talks about inside jobs, self-inflicted wound, false flag, government-sponsored, Reichstag-type events.
[01:09:14.238 --> 01:09:19.321]  Now, Tyrell got cut off by the break, and he was talking, he said something really astute.
[01:09:20.168 --> 01:09:32.482]  He said they don't want the oversight of the fusion centers, the federalization centers all over the country from small towns to big cities, because when they get caught violating people's rights, they want to just fire the underlings.
[01:09:32.562 --> 01:09:40.010]  Well, that's already happened in Pennsylvania, in Ohio, and in many other states where Homeland Security is hiring Israelis.
[01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:45.272]  NLE09 with FEMA, 14 different nations to spy on citizens.
[01:09:45.292 --> 01:09:47.333]  They're bringing in foreigners to do this.
[01:09:47.353 --> 01:09:51.934]  We're going to put some of those articles on screen while Tyrell is talking.
[01:09:51.954 --> 01:09:59.715]  But if you just search Israeli company spying on citizens for homeland security, it will come up for you.
[01:09:59.755 --> 01:10:01.136]  We wrote a bunch of articles about that.
[01:10:01.176 --> 01:10:03.416]  Then even mainstream media picked up on it.
[01:10:03.716 --> 01:10:05.897]  So this abuse, Tyrell, is already going on.
[01:10:06.892 --> 01:10:08.253]  Yeah, it's not surprising.
[01:10:08.313 --> 01:10:13.474]  I mean, it's really deadly out there, and the abuses are all over the place.
[01:10:13.514 --> 01:10:14.515]  They're very flagrant.
[01:10:15.235 --> 01:10:24.879]  And then, like I said, ultimately they'll put up the poor underling, fire the underling, much like they did with the Wall Street deal.
[01:10:25.059 --> 01:10:32.582]  They'll fire all the small-time traders who are legitimately breaking the law, but they'll throw all them in jail, but they'll leave the big wigs behind.
[01:10:32.622 --> 01:10:33.562]  It's the same principle.
[01:10:34.082 --> 01:10:45.567]  You know, and then that way the public who watches, you know, the news is, oh, okay, well they fired that guy, he was a bad guy, but ultimately they're good programs and good projects, which is, it's asinine, it should not be that way.
[01:10:45.607 --> 01:10:49.569]  I mean, they need to get good governmental oversight or get rid of them completely.
[01:10:50.069 --> 01:10:55.752]  You know, we have a good police force, we have, you know, a good FBI when they do their jobs and let them do their jobs.
[01:10:56.272 --> 01:11:00.674]  You know, instead of trying to create more bureaucracy and more ways to subjugate us.
[01:11:02.751 --> 01:11:04.152]  You know, it's frightening.
[01:11:04.192 --> 01:11:12.738]  I mean, me and Jesse were knocking at the door at the FEMA camp right outside Austin area.
[01:11:12.998 --> 01:11:18.842]  It was frightening when you confronted the woman, the spokesperson, and said, you know, do they hold American civilians here?
[01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:21.043]  And all she said was no comment.
[01:11:21.484 --> 01:11:27.207]  Well, that's neither a confirm nor deny, meaning she was trying to make sure that she, you know, if she said the wrong thing, she could get in trouble.
[01:11:27.948 --> 01:11:30.870]  And to me, the only thing you can say is no.
[01:11:37.013 --> 01:11:39.955]  Well, here's the PrisonPlanet.com headline.
[01:11:40.015 --> 01:11:44.857]  Pennsylvania Homeland Security employed Israeli company to spy on Americans, Tyrell.
[01:11:45.157 --> 01:11:47.279]  I mean, now they're even using foreigners to do this.
[01:11:47.679 --> 01:11:57.464]  That way, if they get caught, they can just say, well, that's a foreign country, just like they use private contractors to spy and do dirty work overseas.
[01:11:58.306 --> 01:11:59.667]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:11:59.707 --> 01:12:01.268]  Oh, that was a foreign country.
[01:12:01.388 --> 01:12:02.689]  Oh, you know, foreign soldier.
[01:12:02.809 --> 01:12:04.189]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:12:04.209 --> 01:12:04.810]  That's not us.
[01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:05.510]  That's not us.
[01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:06.471]  They made the mistake.
[01:12:06.531 --> 01:12:07.511]  They went too far.
[01:12:07.871 --> 01:12:09.032]  You know, we'll let them go.
[01:12:09.052 --> 01:12:10.573]  You know, we won't do that again.
[01:12:10.593 --> 01:12:14.635]  You know, that kind of bait-and-switch kind of tactic.
[01:12:14.715 --> 01:12:19.318]  And Tyrell, they were even spying on members of the Pennsylvania legislature.
[01:12:20.251 --> 01:12:21.212]  That doesn't surprise me.
[01:12:21.412 --> 01:12:23.653]  It does not surprise me.
[01:12:23.693 --> 01:12:30.816]  They're after anybody who presents a threat to them and to where they want to take this country.
[01:12:32.777 --> 01:12:35.258]  And that's the biggest key that we have to get out there.
[01:12:35.698 --> 01:12:41.581]  It's not about voting in the Democrat or voting in the Republican and all things will change.
[01:12:42.101 --> 01:12:43.602]  We have to vote in a brand new
[01:12:44.262 --> 01:12:45.183]  Well, you're right.
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:18.022]  And it's not about voting for, you know, even this last election they voted a lot of new people, but really all the new people are still, you know, they're still part of the corporate system.
[01:13:18.542 --> 01:13:20.123]  And you've got to get away from that.
[01:13:20.163 --> 01:13:20.983]  You've got to get out of that.
[01:13:21.383 --> 01:13:27.284]  And that's what we have to do as good, loyal, good citizens, is to change that.
[01:13:27.784 --> 01:13:34.726]  And hopefully shows like yours and shows like ours will educate the people to wake up and realize that their country has been
[01:13:35.575 --> 01:13:36.777]  Literally stolen from them.
[01:13:37.417 --> 01:13:39.640]  And it's not about to be stolen, it hasn't been.
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:43.164]  They're not going to build these camps, they have built them.
[01:13:43.785 --> 01:13:46.008]  And we need to wake up.
[01:13:46.926 --> 01:13:49.227]  Tyrell, another point on the show I want to bring up.
[01:13:49.347 --> 01:13:59.592]  We know the CDC, and I gave you guys the documents, has gone out to Indiana, New York State, other places, and said, get ready for millions dead from a bio-release.
[01:14:00.032 --> 01:14:05.495]  And we know they've been stockpiling coffins in different areas, these plastic coffins, in different parts of the country.
[01:14:05.735 --> 01:14:14.379]  Your father and I, the governor, went out to Georgia, and they had heard we were coming because we'd hired some locals to take us out there a week before, and they all week had been hauling
[01:14:15.359 --> 01:14:16.240]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:21.704]  You know, if they're really going to be used for what they say they're going to be used, you know, then they wouldn't care if we went out and filmed it.
[01:14:34.938 --> 01:14:39.022]  You know, but I'm just thankful that we got there and, you know, we caught them with their pants down.
[01:14:39.502 --> 01:14:45.988]  You know, they were sitting there and we got them and, you know, it's not something where, oh, well, the CDC says they're doing this and all that.
[01:14:46.008 --> 01:14:47.730]  No, we know what they're going to use them for.
[01:14:48.230 --> 01:15:01.242]  You know, and then we put it on TV and then, you know, I think it's, like I said, I think it's going to be the first time in mainstream media you're going to see a show that truly, truly looks at the subject of these coffins, these FEMA camps, and all of that.
[01:15:01.722 --> 01:15:11.286]  And then, you know, and it's such a bad start, because you can see it coming, you know, they're going to, you know, introduce a virus, whether it's through these vaccinations or whatever, that is going to be a threat to the populace.
[01:15:11.326 --> 01:15:13.807]  And then, boom, you use that to start locking things down.
[01:15:14.467 --> 01:15:20.229]  And then, same thing with illegal immigration, you know, oh my God, all these illegal immigrants and things like that, we've got to start putting them somewhere.
[01:15:20.869 --> 01:15:22.591]  You know, what's the rounding people up?
[01:15:39.696 --> 01:15:50.989]  And that is a chilling video footage when, you know, the one senator is there trying to get that out onto the table and then he gets shouted down, essentially, by the other people who are supposed to be investigating this.
[01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:52.511]  And then we can't talk about that.
[01:15:53.011 --> 01:15:54.413]  You know?
[01:15:54.513 --> 01:15:55.554]  It's just frightening.
[01:15:55.674 --> 01:15:58.117]  It's amazing what we let them get away with.
[01:15:58.317 --> 01:15:59.998]  Well, I'll tell you what else is frightening.
[01:16:00.058 --> 01:16:06.563]  Glenn Beck said he'd investigated camps, they were real, he was going to expose them, and a few weeks later said none of them are real.
[01:16:07.163 --> 01:16:09.285]  And I even predicted how he would do it with straw men.
[01:16:09.305 --> 01:16:11.486]  I mean, they got to Glenn Beck.
[01:16:12.447 --> 01:16:18.291]  Well, Glenn Beck to me is, I mean, he's essentially, he's a corporate mouthpiece.
[01:16:18.331 --> 01:16:19.491]  He's a safe virgin.
[01:16:19.531 --> 01:16:27.317]  You know, when they want to quell activism and things like that, what they'll do is they'll try to move it into something that they run and own.
[01:16:27.977 --> 01:16:33.404]  And to where that way they can keep control over it, and I think that's purely what Glenn Beckett is there for.
[01:16:33.644 --> 01:16:43.417]  He'll allude to something that we're all talking about, and he'll talk about it for a day on his show, and then he'll come back and then bury it, just like you said, with a straw man or something like that.
[01:16:43.857 --> 01:16:44.357]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:17:02.668 --> 01:17:06.829]  You know, Glenn Beck is purely a, you know, he's just a corporate man.
[01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:09.049]  You know, he's earning a paycheck and making millions.
[01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:13.770]  You know, he's not someone who's, I believe, about truly fighting, you know, for our rights.
[01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:27.553]  I think he uses our activism and our want to make this country better, and he uses that to essentially, you know, make money and also tell the party line, you know, and keep us going in the direction they want us to go.
[01:17:29.085 --> 01:17:49.327]  I tend to agree with you, Tyrell Ventura, but now him coming out and saying the government may blow up a federal building to blame it on the American people, I think he realizes that this is very serious and I don't know how they could allow him to do that.
[01:17:49.888 --> 01:17:50.889]  This is groundbreaking.
[01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:52.492]  It is groundbreaking.
[01:17:52.672 --> 01:17:58.404]  I'm very shocked that he would do that, unless they're going to try to turn it into a political issue, which it sounds like they kind of borrowed.
[01:17:58.424 --> 01:17:59.005]  Oh no, they have.
[01:17:59.045 --> 01:18:02.953]  They said Democrats and some mid-level foundations are going to do it.
[01:18:03.598 --> 01:18:09.440]  Which is kind of what they want people to do anyway, that they want us fighting each other, and they want us fighting each other and not them.
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:15.181]  You know, so it makes logical sense that, oh, you know, they were going to stage a false flag attack, and it's the Democrats who are going to do it.
[01:18:15.601 --> 01:18:22.123]  You know, because then that gets one half of the country going like, oh my god, I knew that they would stage these false flag attacks, and it's all the Democrats' fault.
[01:18:22.603 --> 01:18:23.144]  Very well said, Tyrell.
[01:18:23.164 --> 01:18:24.325]  You've got this stuff down.
[01:18:24.365 --> 01:18:28.789]  You know, you're one of the main people that got your father to start looking into the whole New World Order system.
[01:18:48.772 --> 01:19:13.986]  Yeah, yeah, it was, you know, I was paying, I mean, my father kind of got me to start questioning, you know, media and then really questioning history and then current events that happened, you know, through his research into JFK and, you know, and so as I, you know, continue, you know, as I kind of perceive the world that way and start paying attention to more and more things, that's when I kind of discovered the New World Order and the 9-11 and things like that, and I was bringing that to him.
[01:19:17.587 --> 01:19:18.907]  I got his father-son bonding.
[01:19:19.808 --> 01:19:22.349]  So the circle is now complete.
[01:19:22.389 --> 01:19:24.449]  He woke you up and then you woke him up even more.
[01:19:25.129 --> 01:19:25.570]  Exactly.
[01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:28.210]  And we wake each other up a lot of times.
[01:19:28.891 --> 01:19:33.572]  He'll read something that'll shock me that I haven't heard before and then vice versa.
[01:19:33.632 --> 01:19:36.753]  And working together on this show, it happens all the time.
[01:19:37.533 --> 01:19:42.935]  And of course now, even this summer, I had a very interesting thing happen to me this summer while working on the show.
[01:19:43.055 --> 01:19:46.697]  Stay there, yeah, let's talk about some of the harassment and things that have happened.
[01:19:47.397 --> 01:19:49.879]  But it's great to see a father and son working like this.
[01:19:49.939 --> 01:19:52.640]  I hope someday my son can work with me.
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:55.522]  Hope I'm still around then, or that all of us are still around.
[01:19:55.842 --> 01:19:57.103]  Tyrell Ventura, stay with us.
[01:19:59.918 --> 01:20:03.199]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.242]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:08.502 --> 01:20:14.444]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:14.664 --> 01:20:16.805]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:17.105 --> 01:20:23.048]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:23.188 --> 01:20:26.531]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:26.591 --> 01:20:28.292]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:28.473 --> 01:20:30.514]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:30.654 --> 01:20:35.318]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:36.159]  Guaranteed.
[01:20:36.359 --> 01:20:40.403]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[01:20:40.643 --> 01:20:48.653]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:20:48.673 --> 01:20:49.394]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.
[01:20:49.414 --> 01:20:50.255]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuaranteed.com.
[01:20:59.289 --> 01:21:01.812]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[01:21:02.072 --> 01:21:04.055]  This time warns of Greek-style U.S.
[01:21:04.095 --> 01:21:04.795]  debt crises.
[01:21:05.016 --> 01:21:05.777]  You heard me right.
[01:21:06.037 --> 01:21:08.460]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S.
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.904]  economy, its debt, and the current Greek economic meltdown.
[01:21:12.184 --> 01:21:19.052]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[01:21:19.432 --> 01:21:20.694]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:20.794 --> 01:21:27.802]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[01:21:28.002 --> 01:21:35.410]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising interest rates spell economic disaster.
[01:21:35.851 --> 01:21:39.535]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[01:21:39.775 --> 01:21:41.816]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[01:21:41.836 --> 01:21:43.857]  Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[01:21:44.017 --> 01:21:46.137]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[01:21:46.157 --> 01:21:46.378]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:59.127 --> 01:22:03.991]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:22:04.111 --> 01:22:04.891]  What have we got?
[01:22:05.091 --> 01:22:07.213]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:22:07.533 --> 01:22:08.274]  A republic.
[01:22:08.554 --> 01:22:10.896]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:22:10.976 --> 01:22:13.117]  It's not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:22:13.458 --> 01:22:15.379]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:22:15.479 --> 01:22:16.780]  So they think they own our land?
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:18.301]  They think they own our water?
[01:22:18.501 --> 01:22:18.902]  Children?
[01:22:19.102 --> 01:22:19.882]  Our education?
[01:22:20.223 --> 01:22:20.863]  Our money?
[01:22:21.043 --> 01:22:24.706]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:22:25.066 --> 01:22:28.731]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:22:28.771 --> 01:22:29.713]  You have been warned.
[01:22:30.033 --> 01:22:30.854]  We have the facts.
[01:22:31.054 --> 01:22:32.176]  We have the Constitution.
[01:22:32.216 --> 01:22:33.097]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:22:33.137 --> 01:22:33.958]  We have common law.
[01:22:34.018 --> 01:22:36.281]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:36.542 --> 01:22:40.307]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:22:40.407 --> 01:22:45.209]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:22:45.369 --> 01:22:46.750]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:47.710]  Don't tread on me.
[01:22:47.950 --> 01:22:54.833]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:22:58.855 --> 01:23:08.177]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[01:23:08.377 --> 01:23:09.337]  My name is Crystal.
[01:23:09.698 --> 01:23:12.298]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:23:12.618 --> 01:23:16.239]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:23:16.579 --> 01:23:20.540]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:21.541]  What did Crystal do?
[01:23:21.561 --> 01:23:25.205]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[01:23:25.526 --> 01:23:31.813]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[01:23:31.933 --> 01:23:35.497]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[01:24:14.482 --> 01:24:17.705]  Ladies and gentlemen, Max Keiser is coming up with all the financial news.
[01:24:17.765 --> 01:24:20.287]  Drudge Report's top link to us for seven days straight.
[01:24:20.687 --> 01:24:25.451]  He's got our new story out about how this is a big national issue now with the TSA abuse.
[01:24:25.591 --> 01:24:29.995]  More has come out on that that I can't even say on air because of all the profanity.
[01:24:31.255 --> 01:24:34.856]  But it deals with the TSA and what they call the naked body scanners.
[01:24:35.276 --> 01:24:38.037]  That's from the Atlantic Monthly Magazine.
[01:24:38.157 --> 01:24:39.217]  Okay, that's prestigious.
[01:24:39.417 --> 01:24:40.438]  This is really happening.
[01:24:40.858 --> 01:24:43.618]  So we've gone to a whole new level here that we've broken through into.
[01:24:44.139 --> 01:24:46.319]  We're searching the term FEMA camps today.
[01:24:46.419 --> 01:24:48.040]  Put it in Google over and over again.
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:50.480]  I have no doubt you'll make it the number one search term.
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:51.501]  Then people will find out.
[01:24:51.521 --> 01:24:52.821]  I mean, this is big.
[01:24:52.881 --> 01:24:55.442]  Okay, I went to these FEMA centers with Jesse.
[01:24:55.462 --> 01:24:56.502]  I went to Georgia with him.
[01:24:57.222 --> 01:24:57.823]  It was interesting.
[01:24:57.843 --> 01:25:00.466]  I live here in Los Angeles and I'm not dodging rocket fire from the coastline.
[01:25:19.745 --> 01:25:25.809]  I was coming home back in July, early July, when we were first kind of compiling, just started shooting the show.
[01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:32.174]  Got home at about 2 o'clock, after 2 a.m., after being out at dinner meetings and things like that.
[01:25:32.334 --> 01:25:40.119]  Came up my front entrance, my cousin who I live with was coming up the back entrance and he says, you know, hey Ty, there's someone going through our trash in the alley.
[01:25:40.439 --> 01:25:41.620]  And you know, in L.A.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.721]  sadly we have a pretty good homeless population.
[01:25:43.741 --> 01:25:45.583]  So I was like, well, that's kind of normal.
[01:25:45.623 --> 01:25:47.344]  And he says, no, no, the guy's in a suit.
[01:25:48.545 --> 01:25:51.167]  I wish you would have gotten a video camera.
[01:25:51.207 --> 01:25:53.469]  You gotta keep one locked and loaded at all times.
[01:25:53.569 --> 01:25:54.430]  What'd you say to him?
[01:26:13.247 --> 01:26:17.228]  Well, the moment I got down there and went over there, he ran off.
[01:26:17.248 --> 01:26:22.509]  I kind of yelled after him, but he kind of ran off into the night without a word.
[01:26:23.250 --> 01:26:24.150]  But it was very interesting.
[01:26:24.330 --> 01:26:29.651]  The next day I asked all my neighbors who I looked up to for other units in our place.
[01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:35.653]  I asked them if anyone was going through a lawsuit or if anyone was in a divorce or anything like that.
[01:26:37.233 --> 01:26:42.275]  The only person who was doing anything that would probably necessitate that was myself.
[01:26:43.076 --> 01:26:43.916]  So, you know, it happens.
[01:26:44.136 --> 01:26:49.158]  You know, you get strange calls in the night and all sorts of that kind of harassment.
[01:26:49.238 --> 01:26:52.140]  So, obviously, we're shaking them up.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.761]  Obviously, they're nervous about what we're presenting, which is good.
[01:26:55.781 --> 01:26:56.862]  That means we're doing our job.
[01:26:57.912 --> 01:27:00.495]  Well, a lot of other stuff has happened behind the scenes as well.
[01:27:00.555 --> 01:27:03.258]  People go through a lot to bring this information to the public.
[01:27:03.858 --> 01:27:16.231]  I was, you know, talking with Charlie Sheen and Mr. Cuban, Mark Cuban, when he was going to put out Loose Change in theaters nationwide, and they called up one of the producers in Hollywood who was going to distribute it.
[01:27:16.872 --> 01:27:36.982]  and said your your kids are going to be safe AA general I was in the family called up and said your children won't be safe this is this is a message and I had to hear that and then Mark Cuban I was told have been threatened by the Securities and Exchange Commission and he did not make the film he got scared and didn't make it didn't release it and still
[01:27:37.722 --> 01:27:45.047]  They indicted him, and he released to the New York Times their emails threatening him from the Securities and Exchange Commission, and he got phone calls.
[01:27:45.448 --> 01:27:47.329]  I knew about that a year before it was in the news.
[01:27:47.869 --> 01:27:51.532]  I mean, they call up and threaten to cut my wife's head off, to do stuff to my kids.
[01:27:52.032 --> 01:27:55.575]  That's why my house has got six surveillance cameras on it, and we're locked and loaded inside.
[01:27:55.615 --> 01:27:56.375]  We're not living in fear.
[01:27:56.395 --> 01:28:00.118]  You know, if you come to my house to hurt me and my family, no, you will meet resistance.
[01:28:00.798 --> 01:28:04.321]  But this is real, and these FEMA camps are real, and this is groundbreaking.
[01:28:04.561 --> 01:28:06.943]  Folks, you've heard on the show, I promote a little bit.
[01:28:07.623 --> 01:28:11.765]  The other shows, and they're important, you know, Plum Island, Bioweapons, you name it.
[01:28:12.306 --> 01:28:15.107]  But even episodes I'm in, people are like, you're not even really promoting this.
[01:28:15.508 --> 01:28:19.810]  I'm promoting this episode because it is super groundbreaking.
[01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:21.031]  Tyrell, final comments.
[01:28:22.165 --> 01:28:23.766]  My final comment is, hey, you know what?
[01:28:23.806 --> 01:28:25.747]  Tell your friends and neighbors, watch this show.
[01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:33.192]  It is so important that we get people aware of this very dangerous issue that faces us as a country.
[01:28:33.712 --> 01:28:35.454]  And we've got to put a stop to this.
[01:28:35.514 --> 01:28:51.424]  And hopefully if we get enough people shook up by what they see on TV and then they go out and do their own research, they'll hold their political leaders' feet to the fire on this issue and hold their media accountable on this issue for not truly reporting and not truly investigating it.
[01:28:52.225 --> 01:29:02.358]  Because, you know, the more news outlets, and the more we talk about this, and the more we uncover these things, and bring them to the light of day, you know, they can't operate.
[01:29:02.578 --> 01:29:07.985]  They want to operate in secrecy, and if we take away their secrecy, then they have to close them down.
[01:29:08.605 --> 01:29:12.029]  And then we're still, you know, we still have the ability to do that.
[01:29:12.069 --> 01:29:13.510]  They have not locked us down yet.
[01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:20.256]  But we have to, we have to be diligent, and then good citizenship, citizenry, and then prevent this from happening.
[01:29:20.997 --> 01:29:25.822]  And then, you know, thankfully shows like ours and yours, you know, get the rest of everyone else talking.
[01:29:25.882 --> 01:29:29.205]  And then, you know, these Google searches and making them the keywords of the day, that's important.
[01:29:29.805 --> 01:29:36.050]  Well, Tyrell, unfortunately we're out of time, but you have been an exemplary asset to the production.
[01:29:36.150 --> 01:29:37.271]  I've been honored to be involved.
[01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:41.974]  God bless you, and hopefully we'll get your dad on next week about the JFK episode.
[01:29:41.994 --> 01:29:42.575]  God bless you.
[01:29:43.215 --> 01:29:44.276]  Alright, take care of yourself, Alex.
[01:29:44.516 --> 01:29:45.136]  Great job, buddy.
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:50.760]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:52.862]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.783 --> 01:29:56.465]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.835 --> 01:30:03.138]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:30:03.418 --> 01:30:04.499]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:08.904]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:30:09.124 --> 01:30:14.769]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:30:15.049 --> 01:30:17.051]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:30:17.211 --> 01:30:19.894]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:30:20.234 --> 01:30:26.538]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:30:26.718 --> 01:30:28.539]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:30:28.939 --> 01:30:34.002]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:30:34.283 --> 01:30:39.286]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:30:39.566 --> 01:30:44.729]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:30:44.929 --> 01:30:47.893]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:30:48.113 --> 01:30:50.997]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:30:51.017 --> 01:30:51.898]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:31:03.366 --> 01:31:04.287]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:04.627 --> 01:31:08.149]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:08.169 --> 01:31:10.770]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:16.233]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:16.653 --> 01:31:22.897]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:23.317 --> 01:31:28.859]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:29.259 --> 01:31:32.960]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:37.481]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:37.761 --> 01:31:43.283]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:43.703 --> 01:31:46.824]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:47.264 --> 01:31:48.665]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:49.245 --> 01:31:49.665]  It's here.

[01:32:00.899 --> 01:32:04.540]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:12.981]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:13.721 --> 01:32:17.762]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:18.342 --> 01:32:29.164]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:29.804 --> 01:32:38.807]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:39.307 --> 01:32:44.369]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:44.749 --> 01:32:51.912]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:52.232 --> 01:32:54.973]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:03.829 --> 01:33:09.971]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:16.313 --> 01:33:28.417]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, the 11th day of November 2010 on this Thursday live transmission.
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:32.602]  So much breaking news at one time.
[01:33:32.622 --> 01:33:35.645]  It's been said that when it rains, it pours.
[01:33:36.105 --> 01:33:36.826]  Bombshell.
[01:33:36.906 --> 01:33:38.187]  FEMA camps confirmed.
[01:33:38.287 --> 01:33:44.032]  Video, documentation, all up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:44.893 --> 01:33:46.174]  Top drug story.
[01:33:47.495 --> 01:33:54.381]  Dealing with national backlash over TSA naked body searches and pat-downs, rape-downs.
[01:33:55.768 --> 01:33:58.773]  Drudge stirs national debate on TSA abuse.
[01:33:59.114 --> 01:34:02.359]  Top story, seven days into the Drudge Report, top linking to us.
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:04.823]  Every single day, very appreciative.
[01:34:05.103 --> 01:34:06.886]  That's now caused a huge national debate.
[01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:18.579]  Even bigger news is Glenn Beck coming out and saying the government may stage a Oklahoma City-style bombing to blame it on the Patriot movement.
[01:34:18.599 --> 01:34:19.800]  This is a big development.
[01:34:20.141 --> 01:34:24.525]  Glenn now becoming more and more hardcore because he knows they're getting ready to blame it on him.
[01:34:24.805 --> 01:34:26.707]  Glenn Beck, government preparing to stage terror.
[01:34:26.727 --> 01:34:29.729]  I'll talk about that with Max Keiser coming up in about eight minutes.
[01:34:30.250 --> 01:34:30.951]  The economy.
[01:34:32.452 --> 01:34:59.592]  and everything else uh... that is unfolding i mean any one of the stories i can talk to three four hours about uh... it is just so huge now we played this over and over again it's in fall the republic it's an invisible empire burma says great new film that we produced all of those films by the way are available at info wars dot com your purchase also supports the broadcast but more importantly you get the films you make copies of them out to people info wars dot com von romping saying you know two thousand and ten
[01:35:01.213 --> 01:35:03.016]  Marks the birth of the world government.
[01:35:03.457 --> 01:35:04.318]  Global governance.
[01:35:04.759 --> 01:35:09.085]  Well, he gave a speech, and we're looking for the video, but at the G20 yesterday.
[01:35:09.565 --> 01:35:10.727]  Nation states are dead.
[01:35:10.767 --> 01:35:11.368]  That's a quote.
[01:35:11.849 --> 01:35:16.055]  EU chief says the belief that countries can stand alone is a lie and an illusion.
[01:35:16.095 --> 01:35:17.216]  This is the new talking point.
[01:35:17.757 --> 01:35:27.545]  Remember the Prime Minister of Canada two weeks ago saying nations are dead, we've got to give in to globalism to fix the economy.
[01:35:27.585 --> 01:35:29.627]  Globalism has destroyed the economy.
[01:35:29.707 --> 01:35:32.008]  It's designed to de-industrialize in their own words.
[01:35:32.529 --> 01:35:35.671]  Huge developments on that front.
[01:35:36.792 --> 01:35:39.054]  Then we've got all this other economic news.
[01:35:39.114 --> 01:35:40.795]  Greenspan warns of weak dollar.
[01:35:41.576 --> 01:35:52.208]  I've got some video clips I'm going to play with Max Keiser coming up, where Greenspan, this weekend, at Jekyll Island, where they met a hundred years ago to set up the Federal Reserve takeover, said there's criminals in banking.
[01:35:52.509 --> 01:35:55.432]  And Bernanke's like, ooh, on the video, sitting next to him.
[01:35:56.033 --> 01:35:59.897]  So they've gotten so scared, they're now blaming criminals, but saying it's not them.
[01:36:00.658 --> 01:36:12.164]  So Greenspan telling you that a weak dollar is a problem when they are the ones that just put in quantitative easing, and he's supporting that, is like Satan telling you that Lucifer's a bad guy.
[01:36:12.684 --> 01:36:17.627]  It's like Beelzebub telling you that Baphomet or Leviathan might not be too friendly.
[01:36:20.388 --> 01:36:22.049]  I mean, this is off the charts insane.
[01:36:22.530 --> 01:36:27.252]  Brazil's Luniam says world headed for bankruptcy and lets rich nations act.
[01:36:27.272 --> 01:36:28.673]  That means pay taxes to the bankers.
[01:36:30.542 --> 01:36:33.565]  China lashes out at the Fed over the money printing.
[01:36:34.266 --> 01:36:37.829]  They're announcing they want to cut Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security.
[01:36:37.849 --> 01:36:39.270]  They want to seize your private pensions.
[01:36:39.571 --> 01:36:41.032]  That's Bloomberg, AP.
[01:36:41.052 --> 01:36:42.694]  In fact, here's the Bloomberg.
[01:36:42.774 --> 01:36:43.034]  U.S.
[01:36:43.054 --> 01:36:45.476]  debt proposal would cut Social Security, Medicare.
[01:36:46.797 --> 01:36:50.138]  Irish borrowing cost hits record high CNBC.
[01:36:50.559 --> 01:36:57.161]  Once they get you bankrupt, then you pay 20-30% of the bankers for the privilege of using fiat currency they issue in your name.
[01:36:57.421 --> 01:36:59.082]  They get the whole world through this fraud.
[01:36:59.402 --> 01:37:08.745]  As Thomas Jefferson said, if you ever let private corporations grow up around the government and issue currency and credit, your progeny will wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered.
[01:37:10.686 --> 01:37:12.748]  I mean, it is just off the charts.
[01:37:13.248 --> 01:37:14.549]  Everything is coming down.
[01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:21.013]  And as I've been telling you for years, coming towards this point, once they announce the world government, it will just accelerate from here.
[01:37:21.134 --> 01:37:29.079]  But, as Lenin, the evil genius, said, there are some times in history where more happens in a month or a year than happened in the previous hundred.
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:36.424]  And so this is a time where the globalists have liquefied the political system to shape it in the way they want, like sculptors.
[01:37:36.705 --> 01:37:38.266]  We have to get our hands in there.
[01:37:39.312 --> 01:37:40.253]  This is so big!
[01:37:40.874 --> 01:37:45.038]  I want to briefly bring Ted Anderson up to give us the latest gold breakdown.
[01:37:45.058 --> 01:37:46.439]  They drove it down three days ago.
[01:37:46.479 --> 01:37:48.081]  It shot back up yesterday and today.
[01:37:48.161 --> 01:37:49.383]  Silver shot right back up.
[01:37:49.643 --> 01:37:51.685]  Where are gold and silver right now, Ted Anderson?
[01:37:51.885 --> 01:37:54.248]  Well, gold right now is at 1411.80.
[01:37:54.308 --> 01:37:55.629]  Actually, that's the peak right now.
[01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.929]  It's at 1406.
[01:37:58.012 --> 01:38:02.497]  Silver hit a high today of $27.57, right now $27.44.
[01:38:02.957 --> 01:38:04.920]  Both of them up, both of them showing green.
[01:38:05.601 --> 01:38:07.443]  The numbers are definitely rising again.
[01:38:08.364 --> 01:38:11.367]  It's kind of amazing to watch them try to push it back down.
[01:38:11.387 --> 01:38:13.049]  Well, Dr. Roberts, explain this.
[01:38:13.670 --> 01:38:17.913]  Every time they plunge the dollar, other nations get desperate because they're the biggest holder of dollars.
[01:38:18.213 --> 01:38:20.354]  They come in and buy them trying to prop them up.
[01:38:20.374 --> 01:38:21.355]  They're being held hostage.
[01:38:21.375 --> 01:38:22.395]  It's why they're so mad.
[01:38:22.815 --> 01:38:24.537]  Or it makes them devalue their currencies.
[01:38:24.837 --> 01:38:29.259]  So the dollar goes down, then it pops back up, but not as high.
[01:38:29.519 --> 01:38:30.240]  Then it goes down.
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:32.221]  So the trend is down overall.
[01:38:32.921 --> 01:38:33.702]  Please continue, Ted.
[01:38:33.962 --> 01:38:44.933]  Well, yeah, just like you said, as soon as the United States dollar starts to lose value, the foreign countries start to, you know, start to print their money as well, because they're afraid that their exports to the United States will drop.
[01:38:45.293 --> 01:38:48.717]  You know, so to try to prop up their economies, it's like a race to the bottom.
[01:38:49.618 --> 01:38:52.000]  One currency's going down, then the next one goes down.
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:53.341]  Which is the globalist model.
[01:38:53.421 --> 01:38:57.265]  Make us dependents, because the banks have unlimited fiat money to buy everything up.
[01:38:57.365 --> 01:38:57.625]  Ted.
[01:38:59.047 --> 01:39:04.630]  Breaking this down, what are today's gold and silver smoking radio offers only available to radio listeners?
[01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:10.074]  Well, you know, silver went up a little bit, so the silver dollar with your videos is still the best buy I have.
[01:39:10.134 --> 01:39:11.475]  It's $101 now delivered.
[01:39:12.295 --> 01:39:14.236]  But that is, I mean, you just can't beat it.
[01:39:14.276 --> 01:39:24.383]  To get the follow the republic, you know, endgame, the Obama deception, all in one, tied into a silver dollar for each one of those videos, total of three, for $101, that's really a good buy.
[01:39:26.184 --> 01:39:31.367]  Yeah, well, three silver dollars of this type, what, they're almost everywhere going for about, what, $95 a piece?
[01:39:31.387 --> 01:39:31.768]  Yeah.
[01:39:32.148 --> 01:39:33.309]  I mean, $95 for the three?
[01:39:33.589 --> 01:39:34.630]  Well, that's right.
[01:39:34.670 --> 01:39:38.712]  I mean, the silver dollars alone, all by themselves, are $96.
[01:39:38.832 --> 01:39:41.574]  And you were losing money at the $89.
[01:39:41.614 --> 01:39:43.395]  You're still losing money because at $101,
[01:39:44.856 --> 01:39:48.377]  It's three silver dollars, three films, and shipping included.
[01:39:48.397 --> 01:39:58.399]  Now, because silver's gone up, over a hundred and sixty dollar value for the three films, the free shipping, and the silver dollars for a hundred and one dollars, that's shipping included.
[01:39:58.839 --> 01:40:03.560]  Yep, and then of course we also have the British Sovereign right now at $3.86.
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:07.481]  Twenty-one dollars delivered because these have to go registered, insured.
[01:40:07.841 --> 01:40:12.122]  If you want to use your credit card, we have to send a restricted delivery to make sure it gets to you.
[01:40:12.822 --> 01:40:15.986]  But other than that, it's also a really good deal.
[01:40:16.366 --> 01:40:17.507]  You get five videos.
[01:40:17.527 --> 01:40:21.812]  You get the British Sovereign at $3.86 plus whatever the little bit of shipping is.
[01:40:22.593 --> 01:40:24.135]  You get Invisible Empire.
[01:40:24.595 --> 01:40:26.878]  You get Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:40:27.839 --> 01:40:30.401]  You get Fall of the Republic, Obama Deception, and Endgame.
[01:40:30.521 --> 01:40:37.047]  Five films, $100 value, on top of the British Sovereign gold coin at a great price.
[01:40:37.067 --> 01:40:37.588]  800-686-2237.
[01:40:37.608 --> 01:40:37.928]  800-686-2237.
[01:40:37.948 --> 01:40:45.735]  And you've got to say radio special to take advantage of those.
[01:40:45.755 --> 01:40:49.859]  They already have good prices, great prices, but it's even better when it's the radio special.
[01:40:50.579 --> 01:40:58.582]  In closing, Ted, if people just want to get junk silver or silver half dollars or francs by themselves or full ouncers, you've got a lot of great stuff.
[01:40:58.602 --> 01:40:59.962]  Tell folks some of the other things you have.
[01:41:00.282 --> 01:41:00.863]  Yeah, sure.
[01:41:00.923 --> 01:41:02.063]  We have the Buffalo coin.
[01:41:02.103 --> 01:41:02.783]  We have U.S.
[01:41:02.863 --> 01:41:03.143]  Eagles.
[01:41:03.203 --> 01:41:06.545]  We have bars from the Perth Mint, Swiss Credit.
[01:41:06.605 --> 01:41:07.785]  We have junk silver.
[01:41:08.985 --> 01:41:10.606]  Silver bars are very popular.
[01:41:11.246 --> 01:41:12.246]  There's just a whole long line.
[01:41:12.306 --> 01:41:13.927]  Silver Eagles right now, amazingly.
[01:41:13.967 --> 01:41:16.328]  I mean, just going off the shelf like crazy.
[01:41:16.608 --> 01:41:19.709]  I mean, the big thing is right now, Alex, people go to their local coin shop
[01:41:20.069 --> 01:41:23.330]  And they try to buy coins onesie-twosie, and they can't get them.
[01:41:23.730 --> 01:41:25.370]  Because there's so much demand right now.
[01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:27.171]  I mean, silver's been going up a dollar a day.
[01:41:27.251 --> 01:41:33.352]  No, no, I've talked to local coin shops who have been sold out of gold and silver and can't even get it right now in Austin.
[01:41:33.972 --> 01:41:35.252]  Yeah, I know that's the problem right now.
[01:41:35.292 --> 01:41:37.693]  There's just not enough physical supply to meet the demand.
[01:41:38.113 --> 01:41:40.834]  And this problem isn't going away, it's accelerating.
[01:41:41.174 --> 01:41:45.034]  As a matter of fact, Reuters is now posting stories about QE3.
[01:41:45.435 --> 01:41:46.755]  And we're hardly through QE2 yet.
[01:41:47.475 --> 01:41:51.717]  Yeah, it's going to take eight months to pump $600 bill to a trill and to devalue the dollar.
[01:41:51.977 --> 01:42:02.581]  Now they're talking about even more, because if you read that Federal Reserve announcement last week at 1-15 Central, the one on Wednesday, you notice that they said, or even more, we'll do whatever we want.
[01:42:03.101 --> 01:42:04.181]  That's exactly right.
[01:42:04.641 --> 01:42:05.542]  And here's the point.
[01:42:05.942 --> 01:42:10.684]  Paper money, which is worthless, can buy gold and silver right now.
[01:42:11.684 --> 01:42:15.146]  That is not going to be true in the future if they keep moving the direction they are.
[01:42:15.446 --> 01:42:23.790]  You may find a day where you're not going to be able to buy anything with paper fiat money like the Germans did back during the Weimar Republic.
[01:42:24.170 --> 01:42:26.491]  Certainly Argentina came close to that.
[01:42:26.891 --> 01:42:28.372]  Mexico not too long ago.
[01:42:28.392 --> 01:42:32.413]  I mean, what difference does it make if you cannot buy anything with the money anymore?
[01:42:32.814 --> 01:42:34.214]  Or if you had $100,000 in a bank,
[01:42:36.255 --> 01:42:39.920]  And two years from now can only buy $25,000 worth of goods for it.
[01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:42.883]  I mean, that's a 75% loss.
[01:42:43.444 --> 01:42:45.006]  And that's what we're looking at here in the United States.
[01:42:45.026 --> 01:42:46.928]  Meanwhile, gold is up over four times.
[01:42:47.029 --> 01:42:48.711]  Silver is up almost five times.
[01:42:49.181 --> 01:42:49.602]  Yeah, it is.
[01:42:49.662 --> 01:42:52.324]  I mean, just gold and silver is holding its purchasing power.
[01:42:52.365 --> 01:42:54.307]  It still can buy what it used to be able to buy.
[01:42:54.707 --> 01:43:00.633]  Obviously, the premiums will start to rise on gold and silver as a larger percentage of people start to buy it.
[01:43:00.934 --> 01:43:01.414]  But you know what?
[01:43:02.175 --> 01:43:03.396]  The dollar is doomed.
[01:43:03.557 --> 01:43:10.004]  We're at the end of the rope of a 100-year run of a fiat monetary system.
[01:43:10.484 --> 01:43:11.204]  That's what we are.
[01:43:11.345 --> 01:43:11.725]  We are.
[01:43:11.745 --> 01:43:21.710]  Just like you said, Alex, that interest rates are going up on the European countries right now, and the bankers get to print this for nothing and then collect even that greater sum.
[01:43:22.971 --> 01:43:24.932]  And they're the ones who are creating the inflation in the first place.
[01:43:24.952 --> 01:43:26.813]  And Europe's about a year or two ahead of us.
[01:43:26.893 --> 01:43:27.713]  They're done raping them.
[01:43:27.753 --> 01:43:28.513]  They're coming over here, 800.
[01:43:29.674 --> 01:43:31.456]  Well, we're holding them until midnight tonight.
[01:43:31.776 --> 01:43:33.117]  We'll see what the market brings tomorrow.
[01:43:49.793 --> 01:43:50.974]  You notice, folks, it just went up.
[01:43:51.054 --> 01:43:52.035]  I wouldn't wait.
[01:43:52.055 --> 01:43:52.095]  800-686-2237.
[01:43:54.077 --> 01:44:02.244]  Now, in a minute or two, and it'll be with us until 40 after next hour, then I'm going to tell you who the real Puppet Masters are, because Glenn Beck says it's George Soros, and it's not.
[01:44:02.864 --> 01:44:06.167]  George Soros is a bad guy and a globalist, but give me a break.
[01:44:06.507 --> 01:44:13.273]  We're going to tell you who the real Puppet Masters are with Max Keiser, but I'm going to give you my take coming up after he leaves us in about an hour.
[01:44:13.634 --> 01:44:17.177]  Now, before we go to Max Keiser, I've got to play these clips to get his take on it.
[01:44:17.717 --> 01:44:21.678]  Here is a hundred years after they set up the banking cartel operation.
[01:44:22.338 --> 01:44:33.642]  The meeting was secret at Jekyll Island until just a few decades ago they denied this meeting even happened with the big private banking hedge to take over and set up the Federal Reserve and this is what Greenspan said.
[01:44:35.202 --> 01:44:41.243]  From a speech televised from Jekyll Island, Georgia, he talks about bankers being criminal.
[01:44:41.263 --> 01:44:53.446]  If you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, you can see Bernanke kind of freak out when he says this, but this is the rats knowing they're going to be blamed for what they've done, trying to imply that somebody else did it.
[01:44:53.706 --> 01:44:57.687]  Back when Greenspan got rid of the Glass-Steagall with Harry Clinton and others,
[01:44:58.587 --> 01:45:02.430]  There are two fundamental reforms that we need to get adequate capital
[01:45:26.307 --> 01:45:31.991]  And two, to get far higher levels of enforcement of fraud statutes.
[01:45:32.431 --> 01:45:34.372]  Existing ones, I'm not even talking about new ones.
[01:45:34.993 --> 01:45:44.399]  Things were being done, which were certainly illegal and clearly criminal in certain cases, which meant fraud.
[01:45:45.339 --> 01:45:46.521]  Fraud is a fact.
[01:45:46.541 --> 01:45:52.888]  Fraud creates very considerable instability in competitive markets.
[01:45:53.528 --> 01:45:57.933]  If you cannot trust your counterparties, it won't work.
[01:46:00.196 --> 01:46:03.679]  So he's admitting fraud by the bankers, but how many of them are in jail?
[01:46:03.939 --> 01:46:07.162]  Got another clip coming up where he says the fellow reserves above the law.
[01:46:07.642 --> 01:46:18.391]  Max Kaiser, who needs no introduction, syndicated radio host here on Genesis Saturday mornings, BBC TV show, RT TV show, Press TV TV show, MaxKaiser.com.
[01:46:18.451 --> 01:46:20.312]  Max, what is your take on what you just heard?
[01:46:20.332 --> 01:46:23.115]  I am the puppet master!
[01:46:25.196 --> 01:46:25.657]  It's you!
[01:46:25.697 --> 01:46:26.938]  You're the one that's behind it all!
[01:46:27.118 --> 01:46:27.959]  That's the big news!
[01:46:30.213 --> 01:46:33.376]  Well, Max, we're going to talk about that later, who you really think the puppet masters are.
[01:46:33.416 --> 01:46:42.464]  We know it's the Fortune 100 and the military-industrial complex, but what's your take on a bizarre Jekyll Island, Georgia meeting where they're talking about criminal bankers?
[01:46:43.602 --> 01:46:43.862]  Right.
[01:46:43.922 --> 01:46:49.967]  Well, the word is fraud, and it's been, fraud's been the key word for a long time now.
[01:46:50.367 --> 01:46:58.432]  If you listen to guys like Bill Black, who did the savings and loan cleanup, he cleaned up some of the fraud that was systemic at that time.
[01:46:58.452 --> 01:47:00.514]  Professor William K. Black.
[01:47:01.488 --> 01:47:02.489]  Yep, William K. Black.
[01:47:02.549 --> 01:47:17.507]  Now, nobody has really done anything to clean up the fraud in the system now, and if you look at this foreclosure nightmare, as we've been talking about, banks like Wall Street have been committing fraud five different ways, plus
[01:47:18.007 --> 01:47:20.349]  They've created an assembly line of fraud.
[01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:22.510]  Industrial strength fraud.
[01:47:22.811 --> 01:47:28.615]  It's not just a couple of one-offs, a couple of forged documents here, a little bit of shady dealing there.
[01:47:28.815 --> 01:47:40.103]  They've created this assembly line of fraud where they forge thousands of documents and they securitize hundreds of billions and trillions worth of fraudulent securities and they sell these to banks all over the world.
[01:47:40.344 --> 01:47:46.228]  Then they created credit default swaps to make bets on the very fraudulent securities that they created to cash in again.
[01:47:46.468 --> 01:47:48.990]  So it's a Ponzi scheme that took over the world?
[01:47:49.570 --> 01:47:52.852]  An industrial strength assembly line Ponzi scheme.
[01:47:53.312 --> 01:47:54.853]  It's made huge.
[01:47:54.873 --> 01:48:04.700]  Now if somebody in the U.S., for example, forecloses, they have their house foreclosed upon, they lose, let's say, $100,000, the banks on Wall Street make $6 million.
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:05.380]  I don't know.
[01:48:26.232 --> 01:48:27.173]  We're good to go.
[01:48:44.770 --> 01:48:46.292]  We're good to go.
[01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:04.152]  ...be confiscated, have that wealth confiscated at the end of the year.
[01:49:04.332 --> 01:49:17.679]  If he's saying it's fraud, and we all know it is fraud, then how come he's not saying and other folks not saying that, okay, then if the American people own these banks after bailing them out, and they've committed fraud, then give us back our $140 million.
[01:49:17.719 --> 01:49:19.760]  Don't pay yourself that in bonuses, number one.
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:23.622]  Number two, start paying us back some of the other money you stole.
[01:49:23.662 --> 01:49:25.683]  Where's the, you know, the money back to us?
[01:49:27.824 --> 01:49:28.704]  No, no, no, Max.
[01:49:28.824 --> 01:49:32.766]  Instead, they're saying we want global VAT, global carbon.
[01:49:33.086 --> 01:49:35.706]  We're going to have this new Bank of the World around the IMF.
[01:49:36.047 --> 01:49:37.227]  You're going to pay taxes to us.
[01:49:37.247 --> 01:49:39.868]  We're going to have a partially gold-backed SDR.
[01:49:40.708 --> 01:49:44.589]  So when they talk about fraud, they just want to be able to shut down their competition.
[01:49:45.429 --> 01:49:55.232]  Well, yeah, I mean, Robert Zoellick, who's the president of the World Bank at the G20, started talking about a global gold-backed security, gold-backed currency.
[01:49:55.472 --> 01:49:56.993]  Now, up until that statement,
[01:49:57.694 --> 01:50:11.823]  Every time I came on your show and others came on your show, the Salentes or Peter Schiff or anybody who's been on your show, Bob Chapman talking about this, of course they were met with a wall of derision up until a few days ago.
[01:50:12.103 --> 01:50:13.804]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:50:14.124 --> 01:50:19.908]  Robert Zoellick is talking about a global currency that will, in part, respect to some degree gold.
[01:50:19.968 --> 01:50:26.392]  So this is the beginning now of a global currency that has a gold component and it's the beginning of the end
[01:50:26.952 --> 01:50:27.732]  We're good to go.
[01:50:46.478 --> 01:50:57.188]  Like we saw during the creation of the Euro, remember those countries simply traded in all their local currencies for the Euro, but what we're going to see are the US and other countries are going to be swapping the dollar.
[01:50:57.208 --> 01:50:57.669]  Stay there!
[01:50:57.929 --> 01:50:58.330]  Stay there!
[01:50:58.450 --> 01:51:00.992]  And that's going to be the cu- Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.012 --> 01:51:06.377]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:06.597 --> 01:51:08.199]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:51:08.439 --> 01:51:11.221]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[01:51:11.601 --> 01:51:16.705]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:17.185 --> 01:51:21.889]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:22.409 --> 01:51:29.334]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:29.534 --> 01:51:30.375]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:30.635 --> 01:51:36.998]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:37.318 --> 01:51:40.160]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:42.401]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:51:43.922 --> 01:51:46.803]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:47.303 --> 01:51:49.044]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:59.824 --> 01:52:00.627]  Pure water.
[01:52:00.908 --> 01:52:03.397]  What could be better than the gift of health for your loved ones?
[01:52:03.638 --> 01:52:06.027]  And who better to help you give the gift this holiday season
[01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:12.881]  We're good to go!
[01:52:41.539 --> 01:52:41.979]  That's right.
[01:52:59.042 --> 01:53:03.645]  Hurricanes, ice storms, blackouts, and the prospect of civil unrest.
[01:53:03.865 --> 01:53:06.647]  When the unexpected happens, will you be ready?
[01:53:06.907 --> 01:53:13.992]  Hundreds of concerned citizens across America have already installed wind generators to help protect their families in the event of a disaster.

[01:53:42.082 --> 01:53:44.623]  Coming up in about 45 minutes from now, I'm going to show you the real Puppet Masters.
[01:53:44.643 --> 01:53:45.443]  Not George Soros.
[01:54:10.305 --> 01:54:11.586]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[01:54:12.066 --> 01:54:21.913]  When they made everybody turn their currencies into the euro, you go and pull it up depending on the nation, 10, 15, 20, 30 percent loss in currency valuation.
[01:54:21.953 --> 01:54:26.136]  So it's a kind of a hidden bank holiday devaluation system.
[01:54:26.476 --> 01:54:28.777]  Max Keiser, you've called all this with precision.
[01:54:30.538 --> 01:54:35.542]  Please continue with what you were breaking down of how they're going to do this, how you see them carrying this out.
[01:54:37.065 --> 01:54:41.530]  Right, so like we saw with the creation of the Euro, the U.S.
[01:54:41.650 --> 01:54:45.974]  is in a situation right now where they cannot pay down their debt.
[01:54:46.555 --> 01:54:56.745]  They could collect 100% of taxes, of all of the revenues, and they'd not be able to pay down this debt if people paid 100% of their income as tax.
[01:54:57.245 --> 01:55:02.731]  You've got $14 trillion budget deficit and another $50 or $60 trillion in other debts in the country.
[01:55:02.771 --> 01:55:03.512]  So the U.S.
[01:55:03.592 --> 01:55:04.973]  is technically bankrupt.
[01:55:04.993 --> 01:55:11.280]  So they're either going to default on their government bonds, or they can inflate the currency to death.
[01:55:11.761 --> 01:55:13.663]  Those are the one and two choices.
[01:55:13.703 --> 01:55:16.526]  The third choice, when either of those two don't work,
[01:55:17.066 --> 01:55:26.909]  Is to swap the dollars for the new global currency, which means that for the average American the effect will be, as far as economically, they won't be much different.
[01:55:27.189 --> 01:55:30.110]  However, they will have lost their sovereignty, and that's the key.
[01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:42.894]  Just like European countries lost their individual sovereignty and now answer to Brussels as the bureaucracy that governs Europe, Americans will exchange their sovereignty for a global currency and they'll answer to a global World Bank institution.
[01:55:43.554 --> 01:55:46.236]  Well, Max, I couldn't say it any better than that.
[01:55:46.256 --> 01:55:47.576]  So what do we do to counter this?
[01:56:14.238 --> 01:56:21.019]  Well, I mean, yeah, the people who are in a position to...
[01:56:22.257 --> 01:56:28.818]  To make effective policy to maintain America's sovereignty would be Bernanke and Geithner and these people.
[01:56:28.879 --> 01:56:30.919]  They are the people on the front lines.
[01:56:31.319 --> 01:56:34.220]  The job of the Fed is to protect the currency.
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:39.561]  That's their primary job and they've abdicated that responsibility.
[01:56:39.621 --> 01:56:44.862]  They are working hand-in-glove with the folks who, like Robert Zoellick over at the World Bank,
[01:56:45.362 --> 01:56:52.946]  To create this new global currency, and so they're the guys who are in a position to do something about it.
[01:56:53.006 --> 01:57:05.212]  Now, if you're talking about what can individuals do, I have been talking on your show for a long time now about the people who I call the gold and silver vigilantes.
[01:57:05.852 --> 01:57:11.094]  People like John Embry up in Canada, Sprott Asset Management, who's taking physical delivery.
[01:57:11.394 --> 01:57:12.874]  And you see what's happening in silver.
[01:57:12.894 --> 01:57:23.978]  The silver market in the last couple of weeks is a direct result of these guys who I call the silver vigilantes demanding physical delivery of their silver and busting.
[01:57:24.218 --> 01:57:26.059]  Because there's limited supplies.
[01:57:26.079 --> 01:57:30.981]  JPMorgan and others have been caught manipulating gold and silver market by physically taking it.
[01:57:31.342 --> 01:57:35.664]  It shows that they're naked shorting the market with gold and silver that doesn't exist.
[01:57:36.209 --> 01:57:39.010]  Yeah, they sold silver that doesn't exist.
[01:57:39.130 --> 01:57:41.351]  So they've sold 100 times more silver.
[01:57:41.551 --> 01:57:47.193]  And we know this from the testimony from the whistleblower from the London Golden Market Association just a couple of months ago.
[01:57:47.233 --> 01:57:53.916]  And that's going to be on my show, Kaiser Report, with some blockbuster news they're going to be breaking on my show in a couple of weeks.
[01:57:53.956 --> 01:58:01.779]  But we know that the London Golden Market Association, during this whistleblower testimony, is short 100 times
[01:58:03.499 --> 01:58:05.340]  The silver that they actually have in the vault.
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:09.982]  So they've been selling contracts tied to silver that doesn't exist.
[01:58:10.282 --> 01:58:18.885]  So what these huge fund managers, these gold and silver vigilantes, as I call them, what they're doing now is they're forcing the issue.
[01:58:19.305 --> 01:58:24.447]  And this is what's behind this huge move in silver and we see a huge move in gold.
[01:58:24.647 --> 01:58:26.448]  So those guys are the heroes.
[01:58:26.788 --> 01:58:29.889]  Those guys are taking on the central bank crooks.
[01:58:30.129 --> 01:58:33.031]  And they already tried to kill the whistleblower ramming his car.
[01:58:33.832 --> 01:58:35.453]  He better get his info out faster.
[01:58:35.473 --> 01:58:36.634]  He's gonna be deader than a hammer.
[01:58:36.954 --> 01:58:38.395]  Max, we're back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:38.415 --> 01:58:47.061]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.723 --> 01:58:54.347]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:54.747 --> 01:58:57.751]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:57.991 --> 01:59:02.776]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:02.796 --> 01:59:09.023]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:09.163 --> 01:59:11.426]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:11.946 --> 01:59:12.226]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:12.246 --> 01:59:12.686]  Bernanke?
[01:59:12.766 --> 01:59:13.367]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:13.427 --> 01:59:14.687]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:14.707 --> 01:59:16.949]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:30.856 --> 01:59:32.697]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:32.977 --> 01:59:37.759]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:38.119 --> 01:59:48.062]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:52.424 --> 01:59:54.345]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:54.805 --> 01:59:57.586]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.417 --> 02:00:08.599]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:10.060]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.821 --> 02:00:11.721]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.361 --> 02:00:16.003]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.564 --> 02:00:20.686]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.607 --> 02:00:25.969]  The TSA's abuses are now one of the biggest news stories.
[02:00:26.069 --> 02:00:27.710]  It's in the top three or four in the world.
[02:00:29.457 --> 02:00:31.339]  Now Atlantic Monthly's gotten on board.
[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:41.151]  Hundreds of big publications, their writers, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Atlantic Monthly, CNET News, CBS News, are talking about the abuse they've gone through.
[02:00:41.171 --> 02:00:42.653]  The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg.
[02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:43.909]  This is
[02:01:01.391 --> 02:01:01.951]  That's coming up.
[02:01:01.991 --> 02:01:03.232]  Kaiser wants to mention that.
[02:01:03.272 --> 02:01:04.873]  I was asking during the break, I said, what do you want to talk about?
[02:01:04.893 --> 02:01:08.015]  He said, well, I want to talk about the big win on TSA, how we're exposing him.
[02:01:08.055 --> 02:01:08.696]  So that's coming up.
[02:01:09.156 --> 02:01:13.819]  But Max of MaxKaiser.com continuing here with what we were discussing.
[02:01:14.279 --> 02:01:15.080]  It's all happening.
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:17.942]  The bankers that engineered the collapse are taking over the world.
[02:01:18.302 --> 02:01:19.423]  People are angry at them.
[02:01:20.424 --> 02:01:27.033]  You've got all these other Chinese government and Brazilian government and the German government saying this is horrible.
[02:01:27.493 --> 02:01:29.115]  I mean, is that all a bunch of talk?
[02:01:29.456 --> 02:01:31.058]  Are they involved in it?
[02:01:31.338 --> 02:01:36.125]  Or is this a real revolt against the world reserve currency being devalued?
[02:01:36.843 --> 02:01:37.483]  Well, a couple things.
[02:01:37.503 --> 02:01:43.126]  First of all, Robert Zoellick, his gold comment, that was part of a big op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal.
[02:01:43.506 --> 02:01:46.088]  And the whistleblower in London, his name is Andrew McGuire.
[02:01:46.628 --> 02:01:52.451]  And after he's on my show, Alex, I think he should be on your show, if you think that's a good idea.
[02:01:52.551 --> 02:01:53.171]  Yeah, let's get him.
[02:01:53.191 --> 02:01:53.732]  We've been trying.
[02:01:54.474 --> 02:01:54.775]  All right.
[02:01:55.756 --> 02:02:07.916]  So basically to get back to the financial picture, you know, a theme that we again talked about on your show in the past, which is now mainstream media terminology, is currency war.
[02:02:08.757 --> 02:02:10.418]  So what does currency war mean?
[02:02:11.198 --> 02:02:13.119]  Currency war means that the U.S.
[02:02:13.839 --> 02:02:16.940]  is purposefully trying to crash the U.S.
[02:02:16.980 --> 02:02:28.004]  dollar because they believe it's going to force the exports from other countries' price to go higher, and they're going to try to make America's exports more competitive by deliberately crashing the dollar.
[02:02:28.324 --> 02:02:37.607]  And what's happening is that these other countries, like China and Germany in particular, are saying, no, we don't want to be a part of this, we don't want to subsidize your
[02:02:38.327 --> 02:02:47.453]  Manufacturing base and your wars because you know although all that more money is subsidized with the US dollars and these countries are saying wait a minute you want us to subsidize your wars?
[02:02:47.953 --> 02:02:49.134]  No, we don't think that's a good idea.
[02:02:49.374 --> 02:03:03.984]  So now these countries for the first time in the in the post Dollar Reserve currency era are doing these huge currency swaps back and forth with each other so Brazil and China and Russia are swapping each other's currency so that they all have huge
[02:03:04.424 --> 02:03:05.165]  We're good to go.
[02:03:32.096 --> 02:03:32.796]  That's absurd.
[02:03:52.609 --> 02:03:53.709]  You guys are out of control.
[02:03:53.749 --> 02:03:55.750]  The only thing that makes any sense is gold and silver.
[02:03:56.090 --> 02:03:59.711]  And so that's why gold and silver is up against every currency.
[02:04:00.111 --> 02:04:04.493]  And now it's making a move against the euro because the euro was relatively strong for the past few months.
[02:04:04.833 --> 02:04:07.194]  Now gold and silver are making big moves against the euro.
[02:04:07.334 --> 02:04:10.835]  So nothing is safe from the advances of the gold vigilantes.
[02:04:11.575 --> 02:04:17.598]  And the currency war, which is World War III, if you want to think about it, it's being fought in the currency pits.
[02:04:17.618 --> 02:04:22.700]  They're lobbing these huge derivative cannons at each other, loaded with fiat currency.
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:32.444]  And America, again, stupidly, is spending the hundreds of billions fighting ground wars with tanks and weapons and military, and yet that's yesterday's war.
[02:04:32.464 --> 02:04:33.785]  They're looking in the rearview mirror.
[02:04:34.085 --> 02:04:36.766]  Today's war is the currency war, and of course the U.S.
[02:04:36.846 --> 02:04:43.928]  is least prepared to win in the currency war, obviously, because their economy is shrinking the fastest, and their export market is pitiful.
[02:04:43.948 --> 02:04:45.408]  All right, Max, we got a break.
[02:04:45.448 --> 02:04:51.150]  Let's talk about where you see all this going, how you see it unfolding, what this is going to do to the average person on the ground.
[02:04:51.650 --> 02:04:52.550]  All of that coming up.
[02:04:52.590 --> 02:04:56.251]  We'll look at the TSA situation, that big revolt happening.
[02:04:56.271 --> 02:04:58.652]  We'll look at Glenn Beck talking about government-sponsored terror.
[02:04:58.692 --> 02:04:59.292]  It's all coming up.
[02:04:59.432 --> 02:05:03.655]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:03.975 --> 02:05:04.596]  Number one.
[02:05:04.896 --> 02:05:08.038]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:08.318 --> 02:05:08.879]  Number two.
[02:05:09.179 --> 02:05:13.722]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:14.062 --> 02:05:14.503]  It's true.
[02:05:14.803 --> 02:05:19.366]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:19.686 --> 02:05:20.227]  Number three.
[02:05:20.507 --> 02:05:23.789]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:24.089 --> 02:05:27.792]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:27.992 --> 02:05:28.533]  Number 4.
[02:05:28.793 --> 02:05:31.155]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:31.555 --> 02:05:34.939]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:35.239 --> 02:05:35.439]  Number 5.
[02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:39.943]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:40.163 --> 02:05:44.928]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:45.208 --> 02:05:49.229]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:49.390 --> 02:05:50.950]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:06:03.415 --> 02:06:09.460]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:16.926]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:06:17.226 --> 02:06:21.790]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:06:30.744 --> 02:06:34.474]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:06:34.997 --> 02:06:41.160]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:45.202]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:06:45.662 --> 02:06:51.946]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:06:52.046 --> 02:06:52.826]  Thank you.
[02:06:59.110 --> 02:07:02.932]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[02:07:44.026 --> 02:07:44.726]  Look for Max.
[02:07:45.006 --> 02:07:50.468]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:50.669 --> 02:07:54.730]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:55.691]  This is a war!
[02:08:14.733 --> 02:08:17.675]  A financial takeover, a Ponzi scheme impact.
[02:08:18.596 --> 02:08:20.617]  The globalists don't care if you know who they are now.
[02:08:20.697 --> 02:08:24.539]  They've got paramilitary, secret police in every western nation.
[02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:26.401]  They are taking over the planet.
[02:08:26.541 --> 02:08:28.982]  They think they're going to get away with this crime.
[02:08:29.022 --> 02:08:36.827]  And all of you listening, whether you're a fireman, a cop, a teacher, a bureaucrat, or somebody who even works for the system, you are going to lose your standard of living.
[02:08:36.987 --> 02:08:39.969]  You are going to lose your liberties and your freedoms in this process.
[02:08:40.029 --> 02:08:41.871]  You should make the decision
[02:08:42.631 --> 02:08:47.152]  To join the American people and the people of the world against the globalists.
[02:08:47.192 --> 02:08:59.757]  Now, we were talking with Max Keiser, inventor of many of these stock exchange systems, the Hollywood Stock Exchange System, talk show host, TV host, made a lot of accurate predictions breaking down where this is going.
[02:09:00.257 --> 02:09:02.878]  How do you see this unfolding, Max?
[02:09:03.278 --> 02:09:04.598]  Where do you see this going?
[02:09:04.638 --> 02:09:06.999]  Because now we're clearly in the thick of it.
[02:09:07.019 --> 02:09:10.060]  I mean, do you see the bankers getting away with this?
[02:09:11.206 --> 02:09:11.646]  Yeah, I do.
[02:09:11.746 --> 02:09:24.916]  Because, remember in 2008, Hank Paulson wanted to get $750 billion to bail out his old company, Goldman Sachs, and his friends in various banks around the world.
[02:09:24.936 --> 02:09:29.700]  So he submitted to Congress a one-page memo saying, give me three-quarters of a trillion dollars.
[02:09:30.580 --> 02:09:31.501]  That's not a rumor.
[02:09:31.521 --> 02:09:32.982]  I've had the congressman on.
[02:09:33.022 --> 02:09:33.623]  It's now been a minute.
[02:09:33.663 --> 02:09:33.943]  Go ahead.
[02:09:51.977 --> 02:09:53.958]  So then they signed off on that giveaway.
[02:09:53.978 --> 02:09:59.261]  So they know that they can go to Congress and put a gun to their head and get any bailout money they want.
[02:09:59.861 --> 02:10:02.162]  And they can scare people to death and get whatever they want.
[02:10:02.202 --> 02:10:03.223]  There's no rule of law.
[02:10:03.283 --> 02:10:05.204]  There's no checks and balances.
[02:10:05.264 --> 02:10:09.486]  There's absolutely no rules governing these bankers anymore.
[02:10:09.666 --> 02:10:18.711]  And if they do stumble over a law that they break, they either get Congress to pass a new law or they just ignore it and they know that they may have to pay a small civil fine.
[02:10:19.131 --> 02:10:38.861]  So, when push comes to shove, when the debt burden becomes such, and the dollar is not responding to either the flood of money, vis-a-vis inflation, or it's not the austerity measures causing too much social unrest, they'll go to Congress and say either, you let us roll the U.S.
[02:10:38.921 --> 02:10:46.564]  dollar into a global currency right now, or, you know, you're all going to be facing, you know, civil unrest and Armageddon.
[02:10:46.584 --> 02:10:47.445]  So they'll threaten
[02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:54.862]  The Congress, as they've done successfully now several times, this is a tried and true technique to simply threaten the Congress.
[02:10:55.222 --> 02:10:59.483]  And the Congress will acquiesce, and the U.S.
[02:10:59.523 --> 02:11:13.747]  dollar will be rolled up like the euro was created into a global currency, and America will breathe a sigh of relief because the dollar, purchasing power of the new global currency as it relates to individuals in America, will be roughly the same as the dollar.
[02:11:13.767 --> 02:11:15.468]  And they'll be, oh, we averted a disaster.
[02:11:15.908 --> 02:11:19.729]  But in part of this scenario, of course, is that the U.S.
[02:11:20.009 --> 02:11:21.409]  has to give away its sovereignty.
[02:11:21.669 --> 02:11:26.970]  And we've got to pay taxes to this new IMF, World Bank, purely private consortium.
[02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:28.211]  And this is their plan.
[02:11:28.691 --> 02:11:29.611]  They are doing it.
[02:11:30.151 --> 02:11:32.772]  And it gives them total control over our society.
[02:11:33.012 --> 02:11:38.893]  They'll run the stock market up again for a little while, so all the dumb yuppies will fall down on their knees worshipping it.
[02:11:39.633 --> 02:11:42.594]  And then our journey towards enslavement is that much more complete.
[02:11:43.894 --> 02:11:45.735]  But people have got to get ahead of this now.
[02:11:45.956 --> 02:11:47.317]  We've got to expose this now.
[02:11:47.877 --> 02:11:48.057]  Right.
[02:11:48.257 --> 02:11:54.302]  You'll pay local tax, state tax, national tax, and world tax.
[02:11:55.379 --> 02:11:55.839]  That's true.
[02:11:56.259 --> 02:11:58.400]  And the tax burden will be immense.
[02:11:58.500 --> 02:12:03.182]  And of course people will continue to, their debt burden will not be addressed.
[02:12:03.222 --> 02:12:05.543]  And they'll continue to carry these huge debts.
[02:12:05.803 --> 02:12:10.744]  And the servicing of those debts will continue to cut into their income.
[02:12:11.024 --> 02:12:13.425]  And the jobs will continue to disappear.
[02:12:13.685 --> 02:12:15.266]  So we're heading toward, of course,
[02:12:15.766 --> 02:12:36.651]  What I've been talking about, the Gulag-Castino model, and this is part of the Gulag-Castino model, is to keep the debts on the books in perpetuity, and this rolling over to a global currency, it gets rid of, you know, you hear a lot of debate whether we're in inflation or deflation, whether we should stimulate or there should be austerity.
[02:12:36.851 --> 02:12:42.152]  Well, the answer is to go down the middle and just say, let's roll all these debts based on dollars.
[02:12:42.492 --> 02:12:43.172]  We're good to go.
[02:13:01.742 --> 02:13:07.026]  And by the way, there won't even be a big discussion when I'm talking about it a year from now or whatever.
[02:13:07.207 --> 02:13:09.268]  The media will still be saying it didn't happen.
[02:13:09.288 --> 02:13:13.171]  Kind of like they celebrated 50 years of the Euro in 2007, but Europeans weren't told it was official until 2000.
[02:13:13.231 --> 02:13:14.312]  Here's Herman Von Ruppe, the Daily Mail,
[02:13:30.405 --> 02:13:31.646]  Nation states are dead.
[02:13:31.666 --> 02:13:37.692]  EU chief says the belief that countries can stand alone is a lie and an illusion.
[02:13:37.732 --> 02:13:40.195]  So this is global corporate domination.
[02:13:40.275 --> 02:13:47.402]  Everything the New World Order has done, these private criminals, is to get us dependent, get us in debt to them, to take over society.
[02:13:47.562 --> 02:13:53.187]  And as I say on the back of my film, Endgame, for the New World Order,
[02:13:54.128 --> 02:14:03.957]  World government is only the beginning, because their pet project is eugenics and total tyranny, but they've got to bankrupt you to get you under government control.
[02:14:04.357 --> 02:14:05.978]  This is a nightmare, Max.
[02:14:06.018 --> 02:14:07.279]  I mean, this is so horrible.
[02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:18.129]  Eugenics, you know, that's a pretty strong word, but what about this news that pills are going to be equipped with tagging devices?
[02:14:18.249 --> 02:14:19.430]  That's like soft eugenics.
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:24.963]  Well, hard eugenics is injecting Guatemalan children with syphilis.
[02:14:25.023 --> 02:14:45.101]  I mean, this is a bunch of murdering... I understand that, but you see, we live in this technological age, where the same things, the horrors that we saw 50 years ago, are being replayed, but using this sophisticated technology, which brings me to... I want to talk a little bit about this TSA thing, if you want to.
[02:14:45.501 --> 02:14:47.802]  Yeah, let's get into it, because do you agree with me?
[02:14:47.822 --> 02:14:56.186]  This is broken out, huge national, international story, and it's showing the giant resentment and rage and anger that was right under the surface.
[02:14:56.246 --> 02:14:57.946]  It's now pouring forth.
[02:14:59.207 --> 02:15:03.429]  Well, yeah, the point that I wanted to make, and my take on this, I'm curious what you think.
[02:15:04.509 --> 02:15:08.531]  You know, the name of the show, Alex Jones, that you do is Info War.
[02:15:09.449 --> 02:15:20.201]  And a few months ago, for the best of my knowledge anyway, you started this idea of let's get these search terms up number one on the news search on Google.
[02:15:21.262 --> 02:15:29.271]  And my thought is, at the top of the show, when you're talking about how Drug Report is talking about this and how Beck is talking about this,
[02:15:30.018 --> 02:15:37.583]  It's because those guys are only interested in traffic, whereas you are interested in truth.
[02:15:37.943 --> 02:15:40.464]  So the equation is truth versus traffic.
[02:15:40.705 --> 02:15:45.127]  So here on your show, to get out the truth, you put out a search term on Google.
[02:15:45.347 --> 02:15:46.068]  But those guys...
[02:15:47.006 --> 02:15:53.929]  They see the traffic potential of tapping into number one Google search item, and that's what's driving them.
[02:15:54.190 --> 02:15:58.912]  It's not that Drudge or Beck are suddenly converts to any new paradigm.
[02:15:59.172 --> 02:16:02.133]  It's that they see the traffic that you're generating.
[02:16:02.394 --> 02:16:11.798]  So you don't even probably understand that by you forcing these terms, number one on Google search, you have become now the de facto agenda for these news desks.
[02:16:12.098 --> 02:16:13.239]  You're driving Drudge.
[02:16:13.479 --> 02:16:14.440]  You're driving Beck.
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:15.641]  Your listeners are doing that.
[02:16:15.801 --> 02:16:17.002]  Well, I know we're... Hold on.
[02:16:17.202 --> 02:16:19.463]  I know we're driving... Hold on.
[02:16:19.503 --> 02:16:20.064]  Hold on.
[02:16:20.384 --> 02:16:23.706]  I know we're driving Beck, because I have that confirmed from inside.
[02:16:23.746 --> 02:16:25.207]  But Drudge is always hated.
[02:16:25.568 --> 02:16:28.009]  Even before he went off the radio, he hates the TSA.
[02:16:28.029 --> 02:16:34.074]  I mean, Matt Drudge is more alternative media than a Glenn Beck.
[02:16:35.171 --> 02:16:40.916]  Sure, but he's also a guy who is very sensitive to traffic and traffic patterns.
[02:16:40.996 --> 02:16:44.419]  And you know, on the internet, it's all about traffic patterns.
[02:16:44.439 --> 02:16:48.143]  You know, this company that's out there, it's called Drive Media, where
[02:16:51.005 --> 02:16:52.647]  It's a feedback loop.
[02:17:11.028 --> 02:17:20.051]  So, and Drudge is a guy who watches that very carefully because he's got, you know, the number one most accessed site in the world.
[02:17:20.111 --> 02:17:28.493]  Is it because he's the smartest guy in the world in terms of laying out a webpage in terms of what's interesting for people?
[02:17:28.833 --> 02:17:31.014]  It's because he's technologically savvy.
[02:17:31.034 --> 02:17:36.035]  He came out of the tech boom of the 90s and this is what he's all about.
[02:17:36.336 --> 02:17:37.596]  So, my point is that
[02:17:38.442 --> 02:17:39.865]  It's truth versus traffic.
[02:17:40.145 --> 02:17:44.492]  And if you keep harping on the truth, you're going to shape the traffic.
[02:17:45.033 --> 02:17:47.557]  You're going to bend the traffic toward the truth.
[02:17:48.439 --> 02:17:51.424]  And that's an amazing development in the InfoWars.
[02:17:53.015 --> 02:17:56.438]  Well it is, and no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[02:17:57.118 --> 02:18:00.120]  Expanding on that though, what's your view of the naked body scanners?
[02:18:00.761 --> 02:18:09.328]  Because I can't really, we're going to come back from break and get your take on this, but I want to read part of Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones' article up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:18:09.388 --> 02:18:11.469]  It's the top link on Drudge Report right now.
[02:18:11.870 --> 02:18:16.973]  Drudge stirs a national debate on TSA abuse, because it really was Drudge picking up our stories the last
[02:18:17.874 --> 02:18:20.159]  Seven days that broke this out nationwide.
[02:18:20.199 --> 02:18:29.396]  It's a symbiotic thing It's Alex Jones my listeners and then drudge and then that underlying anger national body scanner opt-out day organized as resistance grows
[02:18:30.350 --> 02:18:34.472]  But Watson's got a quote in here, because I wrote part of the story, he wrote this part.
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:53.088]  And see, like I told my wife last night, the truth is never out of fashion.
[02:18:54.090 --> 02:18:55.172]  It's not trendy.
[02:18:55.272 --> 02:18:56.053]  It's not a fad.
[02:18:56.113 --> 02:18:57.035]  Truth is not a fad.
[02:18:57.997 --> 02:19:00.922]  But it goes on here to quote
[02:19:02.093 --> 02:19:05.556]  And I'm now trying to find it here in the article.
[02:19:05.616 --> 02:19:22.772]  The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg was told by a TSA agent directly that pat-downs were made increasingly invasive not for any genuine security reason but to make the experience so uncomfortable for the traveler that they would prefer to use the body scanner despite the fact that scientists at Columbia University and the interagency
[02:19:23.212 --> 02:19:23.672]  We're good to go.
[02:19:44.952 --> 02:19:47.376]  Male member measuring device.
[02:19:47.396 --> 02:19:49.158]  They use another word, a street term.
[02:19:49.679 --> 02:19:52.323]  The male member measuring device over molestation.
[02:19:52.603 --> 02:19:58.132]  He went on to tell him that that's what they call it system-wide is the male member measuring device and it's all a big joke.
[02:19:58.212 --> 02:19:58.692]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:59.963 --> 02:20:02.925]  Most Americans believe famine and hunger will never happen.
[02:20:03.245 --> 02:20:04.445]  But what if... Day 1.
[02:20:05.166 --> 02:20:06.907]  Mayhem breaks out at grocery stores.
[02:20:07.587 --> 02:20:08.107]  Day 3.
[02:20:08.547 --> 02:20:10.869]  Families are on edge.
[02:20:10.929 --> 02:20:11.129]  Day 5.
[02:20:11.969 --> 02:20:13.190]  The neighbors come knocking.
[02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:14.410]  Day 10.
[02:20:15.031 --> 02:20:17.492]  Small bands of thieves begin stealing at gunpoint.
[02:20:18.332 --> 02:20:18.532]  Day 15.
[02:20:19.633 --> 02:20:20.373]  Desperation.
[02:20:20.493 --> 02:20:23.315]  But the government can't help because there's no food left.
[02:20:25.473 --> 02:20:29.736]  Introducing the Grab and Go Emergency Food Supply from Solutions from Science.

[02:20:48.191 --> 02:20:50.013]  Better a year too soon than one day too late.
[02:20:59.963 --> 02:21:00.803]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:21:00.983 --> 02:21:06.324]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:21:06.504 --> 02:21:06.924]  I get it.
[02:21:07.064 --> 02:21:16.386]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:21:16.666 --> 02:21:17.867]  That's not what's happening.
[02:21:18.087 --> 02:21:26.328]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:21:26.548 --> 02:21:29.789]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:21:29.929 --> 02:21:34.030]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:21:34.210 --> 02:21:35.771]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:21:35.811 --> 02:21:39.032]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:21:39.212 --> 02:21:43.393]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:21:43.573 --> 02:21:44.294]  You should, too.
[02:21:44.474 --> 02:21:45.454]  Find out what they know.
[02:21:45.634 --> 02:21:48.555]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:21:48.575 --> 02:21:48.615]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.635 --> 02:21:48.675]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.695 --> 02:21:49.055]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.996 --> 02:22:02.717]  And you're subject to public police action.
[02:22:03.557 --> 02:22:04.477]  Tyranny is here.
[02:22:04.818 --> 02:22:08.399]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:22:08.599 --> 02:22:10.960]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:22:10.980 --> 02:22:16.422]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:22:16.842 --> 02:22:23.085]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:22:23.505 --> 02:22:29.066]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:22:29.486 --> 02:22:33.167]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:22:33.667 --> 02:22:37.668]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:22:37.948 --> 02:22:43.449]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:22:43.889 --> 02:22:46.849]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:22:47.449 --> 02:22:48.870]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:22:49.410 --> 02:22:49.850]  It's here.

[02:22:58.700 --> 02:23:02.966]  Rock Creek gently flows through the parkland of Washington, D.C.
[02:23:03.426 --> 02:23:07.752]  until it meets the mighty Potomac River in the heart of the federal city.

[02:23:28.348 --> 02:23:31.289]  The Creek is a completely reader-supported publication.

[02:23:54.135 --> 02:23:54.875]  Call them at 301-452-0090 today.
[02:24:03.396 --> 02:24:05.017]  You look like an angel.
[02:24:05.617 --> 02:24:07.898]  You look like an angel.
[02:24:07.939 --> 02:24:09.039]  Walk like an angel.
[02:24:09.639 --> 02:24:11.921]  Walk like an angel.
[02:24:11.961 --> 02:24:12.981]  Talk like an angel.
[02:24:14.142 --> 02:24:15.503]  But I got one.
[02:24:16.363 --> 02:24:17.864]  You're the devil.
[02:24:17.904 --> 02:24:19.925]  You're the devil in disguise.
[02:24:20.165 --> 02:24:25.308]  You know, folks, I'm just an average guy who knew how to read trilateral commission and CFR public documents.
[02:24:26.028 --> 02:24:28.550]  And I came out and warned people like so many others did.
[02:24:29.785 --> 02:24:37.594]  And I made films, I did a radio show, I invested any of our profits back in the operation to reach more people because I want to live free.
[02:24:37.995 --> 02:24:39.336]  I'm in a fight with these globalists.
[02:24:39.376 --> 02:24:40.037]  I don't like them.
[02:24:40.077 --> 02:24:40.718]  It's personal.
[02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:48.167]  And Max Keiser's out there fighting them, and so many others are out there fighting them, and Ron Paul, and Gerald Solente, and countless others.
[02:24:49.602 --> 02:24:50.803]  But this is so real.
[02:24:51.523 --> 02:24:55.146]  And the fact that we're engaging the New World Order, that we're having an effect.
[02:24:55.686 --> 02:25:00.470]  Look, if I can do this in 15 years, what can you do now that people are ready to wake up?
[02:25:01.150 --> 02:25:02.451]  Everybody needs to be heard.
[02:25:02.772 --> 02:25:08.416]  Whether it's driving down the price of Coke so we can take their scalp, as Max has said, and scare the others.
[02:25:08.816 --> 02:25:18.103]  Or whether it's the silver and gold vigilantes buying it and holding it, exposing the fact that the globalists have been manipulating the market and aren't taking physical possession.
[02:25:18.743 --> 02:25:22.024]  And they're just using, you know, made-up silver and gold stores to do this.
[02:25:22.684 --> 02:25:25.125]  We have power, is the final message.
[02:25:25.945 --> 02:25:28.306]  And we are the majority if we take action.
[02:25:29.106 --> 02:25:30.007]  But Max is right.
[02:25:30.047 --> 02:25:33.388]  We're now at the point of world government openly taking over.
[02:25:33.448 --> 02:25:37.069]  Now, we'll fight it once it takes over completely, because then it'll be even more evident.
[02:25:37.369 --> 02:25:41.110]  That's why they have this police state straitjacket in place to keep us in line.
[02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:43.311]  But that's not going to work either, because it's illegitimate.
[02:25:44.271 --> 02:25:46.732]  Max, all over the world people are revolting.
[02:25:46.752 --> 02:25:51.334]  The government's sending in provocateurs in England, that's even mainstream news, to demonize the protest.
[02:25:51.814 --> 02:25:54.616]  The British Prime Minister wants to start restricting protesting.
[02:25:54.896 --> 02:25:55.856]  That's not going to work.
[02:25:56.136 --> 02:25:58.317]  We're making the tyrants act like tyrants.
[02:25:58.798 --> 02:25:59.978]  Where do you see this going?
[02:26:00.598 --> 02:26:04.240]  Global insurrection against corporate and banking occupation.
[02:26:04.460 --> 02:26:06.461]  You know, I talked about it on your show two years ago.
[02:26:07.405 --> 02:26:17.034]  Everywhere, all over the world, people are suffering the same problems that they're being occupied by their bankers who are destroying their economies.
[02:26:17.515 --> 02:26:19.737]  And I think now people are getting some focus.
[02:26:19.897 --> 02:26:28.846]  They understand that all of the regional skirmishes and all of the local problems that they were angry about, they're directing them now.
[02:26:29.446 --> 02:26:30.366]  We're good to go.
[02:26:58.192 --> 02:27:02.335]  That equation is now destroying lives all over the world.
[02:27:02.575 --> 02:27:03.955]  People are rioting in Ireland.
[02:27:03.995 --> 02:27:05.536]  People are rioting in England.
[02:27:05.576 --> 02:27:06.937]  People are rioting in France.
[02:27:06.977 --> 02:27:08.358]  People are rioting in Greece.
[02:27:08.698 --> 02:27:12.560]  And of course, Iceland wasn't the first country to get destroyed by this.
[02:27:12.580 --> 02:27:16.603]  But they're drunk on fluoride here, so they're just sucking their thumbs.
[02:27:17.230 --> 02:27:17.610]  Well, the U.S.
[02:27:17.690 --> 02:27:20.171]  is a little behind because the U.S.
[02:27:20.191 --> 02:27:23.471]  still enjoys the benefits of the U.S.
[02:27:23.511 --> 02:27:25.872]  dollar for the moment, being the world reserve currency.
[02:27:26.132 --> 02:27:40.175]  That means that the people in America, their experience with the economy, which comes primarily through pumping gas into their gas tank and buying food at the store, they don't see prices yet jumping the way that they will jump
[02:27:40.795 --> 02:27:50.925]  When this dollar is finally destroyed and then when prices are up to 300% in a couple of months, then Americans will join the fight.
[02:27:51.006 --> 02:27:57.112]  But right now they're being lulled into this false complacency by these artificially cheap prices that come to them.
[02:27:57.632 --> 02:27:58.593]  We're good to go.
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:19.670]  Americans are going to now experience what these other countries are experiencing, and they will join the fight as well.
[02:28:19.710 --> 02:28:28.043]  So, it's just, it's all economics in the end, and when prices move to points that get people angry, then they, in fact, will join the fight as well.
[02:28:31.129 --> 02:28:31.689]  And we're here.
[02:28:31.809 --> 02:28:33.850]  People are getting a reality check.
[02:28:33.870 --> 02:28:35.931]  They are starting to pay attention to real issues.
[02:28:36.071 --> 02:28:37.932]  Everything we talked about is now unfolding.
[02:28:38.753 --> 02:28:39.753]  And it's us or them.
[02:28:40.093 --> 02:28:42.394]  And we need to talk about prosecution of these bankers.
[02:28:42.414 --> 02:28:46.837]  You know, if Greenspan admits there's all this fraud, but then tells us they're above the law.
[02:28:47.137 --> 02:28:48.317]  No, they're not above the law.
[02:28:48.497 --> 02:28:54.120]  And as Thomas Jefferson said, the level of tyranny we will live under is the level we put up with.
[02:28:54.420 --> 02:28:55.301]  There's no end.
[02:28:55.421 --> 02:28:58.822]  Either we start saying no, or it only gets worse.
[02:28:58.882 --> 02:29:00.163]  And all these petty people,
[02:29:01.420 --> 02:29:04.761]  Yuppies and bureaucrats and stockbrokers and cops.
[02:29:05.362 --> 02:29:07.723]  And I'm not saying all stockbrokers are bad or all cops are bad.
[02:29:07.743 --> 02:29:09.664]  I'm saying people that think they're part of the system.
[02:29:09.684 --> 02:29:14.326]  You know them, Max, who are on power trips because they feel like they're establishment.
[02:29:14.686 --> 02:29:15.786]  They're going to be hurt as well.
[02:29:16.066 --> 02:29:19.728]  So they better make the decision to join with their fellow liberty lovers.
[02:29:20.697 --> 02:29:24.899]  Well, one campaign that was big last year was the Move Your Money campaign.
[02:29:24.999 --> 02:29:27.641]  You know, move your money out of the big money center banks to your local banks.
[02:29:27.701 --> 02:29:32.803]  The problem is that as the economy shrinks, the big banks are gobbling up the smaller banks.
[02:29:32.983 --> 02:29:35.825]  So your money is going to end up going into the big banks anyway.
[02:29:35.845 --> 02:29:38.666]  I think the Move Your Money campaign is really a half-step.
[02:29:38.847 --> 02:29:43.109]  The real move, the power move, is to do what these gold and silver vigilantes are doing.
[02:29:43.329 --> 02:29:45.650]  If every single American bought... Let's talk about that.
[02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:48.832]  Final segment with Max Keiser, then I'm getting into the real Puppet Masters.
[02:29:49.612 --> 02:29:52.597]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.518 --> 02:29:56.202]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.784 --> 02:30:03.088]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:30:03.368 --> 02:30:04.429]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:30:04.489 --> 02:30:08.854]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:30:09.054 --> 02:30:14.700]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:30:15.001 --> 02:30:16.983]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:30:17.163 --> 02:30:19.846]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:30:20.166 --> 02:30:26.469]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:30:26.669 --> 02:30:28.490]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:30:28.890 --> 02:30:33.952]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:30:34.212 --> 02:30:39.214]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:30:39.494 --> 02:30:44.717]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:30:44.877 --> 02:30:47.818]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:30:48.058 --> 02:30:51.019]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:30:51.039 --> 02:30:51.800]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:30:51.820 --> 02:30:54.341]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:30:54.361 --> 02:30:57.222]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:31:15.407 --> 02:31:26.222]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[02:31:28.407 --> 02:31:32.408]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:31:33.128 --> 02:31:36.249]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:31:36.969 --> 02:31:37.789]  Others don't.
[02:31:38.189 --> 02:31:40.070]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:31:40.350 --> 02:31:41.830]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:31:42.130 --> 02:31:44.691]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:31:45.011 --> 02:31:49.072]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:31:49.232 --> 02:31:51.272]  So you can ride all day with confidence.

[02:31:54.333 --> 02:31:56.374]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[02:31:56.694 --> 02:31:57.574]  Others don't.
[02:31:58.783 --> 02:32:03.006]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:03.326 --> 02:32:03.607]  Number 1.
[02:32:04.247 --> 02:32:07.389]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:07.670 --> 02:32:08.230]  Number 2.
[02:32:08.530 --> 02:32:13.074]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:13.414 --> 02:32:13.854]  It's true.
[02:32:14.154 --> 02:32:18.718]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:19.038 --> 02:32:19.578]  Number 3.
[02:32:19.859 --> 02:32:23.141]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:23.441 --> 02:32:27.144]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:27.344 --> 02:32:27.885]  Number 4.
[02:32:28.145 --> 02:32:30.507]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:30.907 --> 02:32:34.290]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:34.591 --> 02:32:35.111]  Number 5.
[02:32:35.371 --> 02:32:39.295]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:39.515 --> 02:32:44.299]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:44.579 --> 02:32:48.543]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:48.743 --> 02:32:50.285]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:32:50.525 --> 02:32:52.607]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:32:52.767 --> 02:32:55.250]  So go to MySolarBackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:55.290 --> 02:33:06.102]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:07.023 --> 02:33:08.264]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:11.704 --> 02:33:17.066]  I'll talk more about this tomorrow, but I want to discuss Glenn Beck talking about government-sponsored terror.
[02:33:18.026 --> 02:33:19.346]  This is a big change for Glenn.
[02:33:19.386 --> 02:33:23.208]  He said anybody that says the government can stage terror attacks is an evil demon.
[02:33:23.828 --> 02:33:26.729]  And now he's reversing himself because he's being set up.
[02:33:27.389 --> 02:33:39.134]  for the next terror attack and so am I. They're saying that patriots, anti-globalists are going to blow up buildings and they're getting ready to frame us and that's clear and Beck is playing the exact same video clips we played last week.
[02:33:39.514 --> 02:33:41.635]  The exact same articles we wrote back in July.
[02:33:41.996 --> 02:33:44.817]  He is starting to get the fact that he's in danger.
[02:33:44.837 --> 02:33:46.838]  I think it's more than him just being a corporate shill.
[02:33:47.278 --> 02:33:48.819]  I think he realizes he's about to be
[02:33:49.759 --> 02:33:50.059]  I don't
[02:34:13.015 --> 02:34:17.917]  The Fox Karambit is a form-fitted beveled to the most comfortable knife ever held.
[02:34:18.238 --> 02:34:25.161]  The ring feature helps keep the knife secure in place to help prevent slipping and being disarmed.
[02:34:25.441 --> 02:34:35.406]  The Emerson Wave Catch feature allows you to open it with one hand faster than a switchblade with no springs using high-grade metals and materials that make the knife worth every penny.
[02:34:35.486 --> 02:34:40.729]  Other knives of the same quality cost up to 2.5 times more backed by a full
[02:34:41.349 --> 02:35:07.340]  uh... one-year warranty and full seven day trial money-back guarantee uh... remembered legislation there are less uh... choices to defend yourself you need the ultimate knife the fox karambit knife ten dollars off right now for our listeners on the black g ten model the one i like the best it's the ultimate knife dot com that's w w w dot the ultimate knife dot com and they've got a uh... video demonstrating it at their website
[02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:10.221]  TheUltimateKnife.com.
[02:35:11.001 --> 02:35:14.963]  One other sponsor that I wanted to tell you about is InnerFood.
[02:35:16.583 --> 02:35:23.146]  Made in America, high quality, 20 organic, non-pasteurized superfoods in their best-selling InnerFood.
[02:35:23.166 --> 02:35:25.267]  They've got a bunch of other great organic products.
[02:35:25.307 --> 02:35:26.067]  They're Patriots.
[02:35:26.587 --> 02:35:27.568]  It's very affordable.
[02:35:27.808 --> 02:35:28.268]  I have it.
[02:35:28.308 --> 02:35:29.128]  My wife loves it.
[02:35:29.188 --> 02:35:30.789]  Rob Jacobson here at the office just loves it.
[02:35:31.189 --> 02:35:33.270]  E-N-E-R-Food.com.
[02:35:33.290 --> 02:35:34.431]  That's InnerFood.com.
[02:35:34.451 --> 02:35:37.772]  A couple little scoops in your orange juice or apple juice or water in the morning.
[02:35:38.092 --> 02:35:38.672]  I got an idea.
[02:35:38.692 --> 02:35:39.553]  I got an idea.
[02:36:07.517 --> 02:36:08.657]  I just thought I'd start on the break.
[02:36:09.078 --> 02:36:13.839]  You know, I was talking to this guy, Michael Krieger, who's someone you should have on your show, by the way.
[02:36:14.079 --> 02:36:16.700]  He's very hooked in with the guys over at Zero Hedge.
[02:36:17.180 --> 02:36:18.340]  He's a brilliant writer.
[02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:21.821]  He's got some fantastic stuff to share.
[02:36:22.161 --> 02:36:23.521]  Michael Krieger is his name.
[02:36:23.921 --> 02:36:24.722]  You should have him on your show.
[02:36:24.742 --> 02:36:33.884]  But I was talking to him about the fact that if everyone in America bought one silver coin, or even if 100 million people in America bought one silver coin, that's 100 million ounces.
[02:36:34.677 --> 02:36:39.340]  Uh, and take that off the market, it would crash JP Morgan, and we would have a scalp.
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:40.521]  We would have a major victory.
[02:36:40.761 --> 02:36:51.789]  So my idea is, what about one of your, you know, force this up the Google search ideas, with a search term, crash JP Morgan, buy silver.
[02:36:52.729 --> 02:36:59.214]  See if we can, in fact, crash JP Morgan by getting everybody to buy one ounce of silver.
[02:37:01.704 --> 02:37:02.344]  Yeah, because of all the
[02:37:22.122 --> 02:37:27.729]  Solutions, as we have described them, over the month.
[02:37:28.029 --> 02:37:36.799]  I'm going to school on you, because I see what you're doing with the Google search and the Interpol wars is having a profound effect on the national discussion.
[02:37:36.959 --> 02:37:39.262]  You, in my opinion, you're driving Beck.
[02:37:39.302 --> 02:37:40.884]  You know, Beck is a ratings whore.
[02:37:41.084 --> 02:37:42.905]  They'll go wherever the ratings are.
[02:37:43.246 --> 02:37:44.327]  The same thing with Drudge.
[02:37:44.407 --> 02:37:51.032]  If they see the traffic on Google exploding based on your search engine suggestions, that's where the sheep will go.
[02:37:51.232 --> 02:37:52.413]  Drudge and Beck are sheep.
[02:37:52.613 --> 02:37:55.175]  They're now following the truth talker.
[02:37:55.476 --> 02:37:59.799]  So I'm saying if you can go down this path, if they crash J.P.
[02:37:59.859 --> 02:38:04.123]  Morgan by silver, we can in fact crash J.P.
[02:38:04.143 --> 02:38:04.423]  Morgan.
[02:38:04.463 --> 02:38:04.743]  J.P.
[02:38:04.783 --> 02:38:08.987]  Morgan is one of the biggest financial terrorists in America today.
[02:38:09.027 --> 02:38:10.608]  Probably even bigger than Goldman Sachs.
[02:38:11.228 --> 02:38:23.410]  If the American people can take this on and put that company under, take that stock price down to zero, simply by putting $25 or $50 into buying one or two silver coins, that would be a major victory!
[02:38:25.531 --> 02:38:28.111]  Well, again, I think your idea is excellent.
[02:38:28.471 --> 02:38:31.632]  It takes some preparation, is the point I'm making.
[02:38:32.472 --> 02:38:35.833]  So we'll have to discuss this and develop it for the very near future.
[02:38:37.079 --> 02:38:41.302]  Perhaps, Max, you should write an article for InfoWars or Prison Planet next week.
[02:38:41.322 --> 02:39:04.158]  We should choose a date and then have it all elegantly and clearly laid out for people so that when they click on that search term, they actually see a story that gives them the info or the profound idea you have will be lost, kind of like throwing your seeds on the rock, not in the fertile soil, as Christ said.
[02:39:04.658 --> 02:39:06.200]  But, Max, always amazing.
[02:39:07.389 --> 02:39:10.532]  Talking to you, Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[02:39:11.232 --> 02:39:13.074]  We'll talk to you in the very near future, Max.
[02:39:13.714 --> 02:39:14.395]  God bless!
[02:39:15.295 --> 02:39:16.276]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:39:16.757 --> 02:39:18.258]  There goes Max Keiser.
[02:39:20.499 --> 02:39:29.407]  And it is true that InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com more and more are beginning to drive the news.
[02:39:30.227 --> 02:39:31.708]  And if you go up to
[02:39:33.404 --> 02:39:34.786]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:39:35.747 --> 02:39:39.752]  The top story today is just so incredible.
[02:39:39.772 --> 02:39:41.614]  I'll be talking about this more tomorrow.
[02:39:41.654 --> 02:39:46.120]  I talked about in the first hour that's about to retransmit in 20 minutes and 10 seconds.
[02:39:46.941 --> 02:39:51.247]  But Glenn Beck, government preparing to stage terror.
[02:39:52.748 --> 02:40:00.134]  In an unprecedented outburst on his Fox News show earlier this week, Glenn Beck identified the threat that we have been warning about for over a year.
[02:40:00.534 --> 02:40:11.542]  That the powers behind the Obama administration are preparing to stage a false flag event that will be blamed on his political opposition to derail the movement against big government.
[02:40:12.663 --> 02:40:16.206]  And then it shows Michael Savage talking about the same thing.
[02:40:16.806 --> 02:40:18.348]  But the issue here is
[02:40:19.673 --> 02:40:22.437]  That we have forced this issue out in the open.
[02:40:22.858 --> 02:40:29.829]  Government-sponsored terror is now something that a lot of people, even mainline talk show hosts and TV hosts and journalists,
[02:40:31.058 --> 02:40:31.838]  Or having to cover.
[02:40:32.438 --> 02:40:37.119]  Because you're not going to beat the naked body scanners by talking about how they're molesting you or how there's radiation.
[02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:39.960]  That will damage the globalists, because it's the truth.
[02:40:40.700 --> 02:40:57.964]  But when you expose that the CIA runs Al Qaeda, and is staging almost all of these attacks, and the TSA lets illegal aliens rent airplanes or go through the checkpoints unmolested, that exposes the full fraud and how the terrorists run the TSA.
[02:41:00.205 --> 02:41:01.466]  It's very, very simple.
[02:41:01.506 --> 02:41:09.370]  The people that staged the terror attacks are the ones putting the police state grid in place and admitting that this TSA stuff is for the streets of America.
[02:41:09.750 --> 02:41:12.291]  Some people have asked me in the last year, why do you cover TSA so much?
[02:41:12.611 --> 02:41:21.756]  Because they admit they're training you, it's even Atlantic Monthly, training you to accept this on the streets of America and worldwide.
[02:41:22.176 --> 02:41:26.498]  This is the Nazi Germany slash Soviet slash malice takeover.
[02:41:29.978 --> 02:41:33.504]  And Beck is covering exactly now what we've been covering the last three months.
[02:41:33.584 --> 02:41:36.529]  Top Clinton official, only a terror attack can save Obama.
[02:41:38.352 --> 02:41:40.315]  That, of course, was Robert Shapiro three months ago.
[02:41:41.055 --> 02:41:46.801]  Now last week, Clinton night, Obama needs OKC bombing to reconnect with the American people.
[02:41:46.841 --> 02:41:50.084]  Curt Nemo, Infowars.com, Democratic operative Mark Penn.
[02:41:50.324 --> 02:41:51.906]  We played the video clip of him on the news.
[02:41:52.146 --> 02:41:53.507]  What did Beck play yesterday?
[02:41:53.547 --> 02:41:54.088]  That clip.
[02:41:54.568 --> 02:41:59.934]  And he said they are getting ready to stage an Oklahoma City to blame it on Glenn Beck.
[02:41:59.974 --> 02:42:00.755]  Well, all of us
[02:42:02.168 --> 02:42:05.171]  See, Beck, they've built you up to destroy you.
[02:42:05.771 --> 02:42:11.616]  They've built you up to act like a clown and be the patriot leader, and you've basically unwittingly done this, the evidence shows.
[02:42:12.016 --> 02:42:18.462]  And now you're figuring out, do I want them, this is Glenn Beck thinking, to blame me for the next domestic terror attack.
[02:42:18.742 --> 02:42:20.223]  Now you're getting it, buddy boy!
[02:42:20.744 --> 02:42:23.246]  Stage terror isn't a joke, it's not a game.
[02:42:25.708 --> 02:42:26.409]  These globalist
[02:42:27.512 --> 02:42:34.195]  Eat their own, and you need to understand that they're all a bunch of backstabbers walking along behind each other up their pyramid of power.
[02:42:35.236 --> 02:42:43.940]  As Mark Kornke has said, it's a big circular staircase going around the pyramid with globalists with knives to each other's backs going up along the path.
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:45.641]  This is a hellish system.
[02:42:46.021 --> 02:42:48.182]  This is what happened over and over again in history.
[02:42:48.563 --> 02:42:51.204]  None of us should want this, including minions like Beck.
[02:42:52.403 --> 02:42:55.684]  So yes, I knew a month ago when Lou Dobbs was on, he was going to Fox Business.
[02:42:55.724 --> 02:42:57.105]  Not from him.
[02:42:57.405 --> 02:42:59.346]  He was amazed when I said, I know where you're going.
[02:42:59.766 --> 02:43:01.026]  I have it from inside Fox.
[02:43:04.748 --> 02:43:06.068]  We have moles everywhere.
[02:43:06.208 --> 02:43:07.949]  We are the True Liberty Movement.
[02:43:08.189 --> 02:43:11.150]  I got so many moles, I can't even talk to half of them.
[02:43:11.170 --> 02:43:11.471]  10% of them.
[02:43:14.482 --> 02:43:15.642]  But I don't even need the moles.
[02:43:15.722 --> 02:43:17.143]  I can see where people are going to go.
[02:43:17.203 --> 02:43:18.763]  I can see what's going to happen.
[02:43:18.843 --> 02:43:19.843]  This is what I do!
[02:43:20.683 --> 02:43:32.465]  And anybody, if you immerse yourself in real information and what the globalists are up to instead of patriot infighting that the globalists try to push us into, because if we ever come together and start focusing on the New World Order, it's over!
[02:43:33.766 --> 02:43:40.647]  You can argue about who runs the New World Order all day, you know, the Masons, Jews, the Catholic Church, the Easter Bunny.
[02:43:41.738 --> 02:43:46.640]  The globalists want us making it about one group or the other when it's really just criminal psychopaths working together.
[02:43:46.821 --> 02:43:49.362]  There's evil people in control of almost every organization.
[02:43:49.602 --> 02:43:57.766]  But regardless of who runs it, let's just agree we don't want to be under a tyrannical, unelected, private, central bank that we pay taxes to.
[02:43:58.306 --> 02:43:59.247]  Let's just agree on that.
[02:43:59.767 --> 02:44:01.488]  See, that's how you have an effect.
[02:44:02.335 --> 02:44:04.297]  And I don't agree with Kaiser about Drudge.
[02:44:04.357 --> 02:44:11.622]  Drudge, I've seen for ten years covering more hardcore issues than others, five years getting more intense, the last two years covering Bilderberg.
[02:44:12.943 --> 02:44:13.744]  He is independent.
[02:44:13.784 --> 02:44:14.965]  That's why he was fired from Fox.
[02:44:15.305 --> 02:44:16.466]  That's why he quit his radio show.
[02:44:16.806 --> 02:44:20.169]  The system does not like what Matt Drudge is doing, and I can only praise what he's doing.
[02:44:23.011 --> 02:44:26.294]  Now, I mean, Drudge linked to us, like, seven years ago.
[02:44:27.435 --> 02:44:28.616]  We weren't even on the radar screen.
[02:44:30.649 --> 02:44:34.933]  And I'm very appreciative of Drudge putting this whole TSA thing on the front burner.
[02:44:34.973 --> 02:44:37.695]  Now, I will reveal who the real puppets are.
[02:44:38.936 --> 02:44:41.138]  Glenn Beck, don't trust him because of things like this.
[02:44:41.558 --> 02:44:43.239]  Here it is today, glennbeck.com.
[02:44:43.540 --> 02:44:47.062]  George Soros exposed on the Progressive Puppet Master.
[02:44:47.603 --> 02:44:48.584]  The progressives.
[02:44:48.984 --> 02:44:55.950]  I've heard Rick Perry, there was video of him in the San Antonio Express News in quotes two days ago, going, it's the progressives of the 1920s.
[02:44:55.970 --> 02:44:56.290]  A bunch of
[02:44:59.332 --> 02:45:03.574]  Beatniks, a bunch of liberals, a bunch of commies, Bertrand, you know, Russell.
[02:45:03.614 --> 02:45:04.874]  Yeah, we've talked about all them.
[02:45:05.154 --> 02:45:07.755]  We've talked about George Bernard Shaw years ago.
[02:45:07.815 --> 02:45:08.596]  They're in my films.
[02:45:09.376 --> 02:45:12.597]  But they're just left-wing acolytes pushing this.
[02:45:12.817 --> 02:45:15.439]  What about the Trotskyites becoming the neocons, Glenn?
[02:45:15.679 --> 02:45:19.380]  Let me tell you who's at the top of the pyramid, and I want to do a whole presentation on this.
[02:45:19.400 --> 02:45:21.061]  I've done it before, but I want to do a
[02:45:22.216 --> 02:45:29.305]  In the next few weeks, you know, who the true Puppet Masters are and really create a pyramid graphic that shows the different blocks.
[02:45:30.253 --> 02:45:37.578]  And they compete with each other at the top, but more powerful than the little low-level communists, because the globalists have to control the full field.
[02:45:37.878 --> 02:45:40.600]  They've got to have fake right-wingers and fake left-wingers.
[02:45:40.880 --> 02:45:42.661]  They've got to try to infiltrate the libertarians.
[02:45:43.082 --> 02:45:45.423]  They've got to try to gauge and control all opposition.
[02:45:45.903 --> 02:45:55.710]  But at the very top of the pyramid is the private Federal Reserve that is part of this global banking cartel, the six major banks that can issue unlimited currency and credit.
[02:45:57.708 --> 02:46:00.911]  That's who our forefathers from Andrew Jackson back to George Washington were fighting.
[02:46:01.612 --> 02:46:02.332]  Read their writings.
[02:46:02.633 --> 02:46:03.514]  This is nothing new.
[02:46:03.854 --> 02:46:06.376]  Same old fight we've had for 235 years.
[02:46:09.219 --> 02:46:11.321]  Same people that run the third world countries into the ground.
[02:46:11.521 --> 02:46:15.305]  Give them a billion dollar loan, they end up paying back 50 billion, they owe another 50 billion.
[02:46:15.365 --> 02:46:16.346]  It's a total scam.
[02:46:16.866 --> 02:46:18.227]  This is what we're going into.
[02:46:18.268 --> 02:46:22.772]  This is what Ireland's going into with their interest rates going up on their national debt.
[02:46:26.308 --> 02:46:29.850]  George Soros in the pyramid is not even up near the capstone.
[02:46:30.170 --> 02:46:38.614]  He's a globalist, he's an operative, but above him is Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, George Sulz, the Bush family, the Clintons.
[02:46:39.234 --> 02:46:42.216]  They are just management team front people, though.
[02:46:43.696 --> 02:46:44.697]  So you've got the pyramid.
[02:46:44.717 --> 02:46:46.638]  In fact, just give me a document cam shot.
[02:46:46.658 --> 02:46:50.039]  I'll just draw a crude drawing of this, okay?
[02:46:50.920 --> 02:46:52.120]  Here's the pyramid, okay?
[02:46:52.460 --> 02:46:53.301]  Not even a good pyramid.
[02:46:56.107 --> 02:46:57.028]  Okay, here it is over here.
[02:46:57.068 --> 02:46:57.388]  How's that?
[02:46:58.749 --> 02:46:59.870]  Here's the pyramid, okay?
[02:47:00.730 --> 02:47:20.265]  And up at the very top of the pyramid, you've got the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Saxe-Coburg Gothas, that's the British royal family, the Dutch royal family, also Saxe-Coburg Gothas, you've got the Oppenheimers, you've got the Brothmans, there's less than a hundred families at the top who are the robber barons.
[02:47:21.380 --> 02:47:22.841]  The Astors, all of them.
[02:47:23.021 --> 02:47:24.002]  They're all intermarried.
[02:47:24.022 --> 02:47:28.385]  When you study these groups, right here at the top, they are all intermarried.
[02:47:29.346 --> 02:47:34.710]  Just like, even at the lower levels, the Bushes are all intermarried with the Clintons and the Cheneys and the Careys.
[02:47:35.170 --> 02:47:46.938]  Now, way down here, in a lower strata, you've got Henry Kissinger, you've got George Soros, you've got Zbigniew Brzezinski, you've got George Shultz, you've got the Bush family, you've got the Clintons,
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:49.762]  And they are social climbers.
[02:47:50.162 --> 02:48:00.132]  Notice that the Clinton daughter, Chelsea, married into one of the big mega-banking house families.
[02:48:02.475 --> 02:48:04.176]  She married into Goldman Sachs.
[02:48:04.697 --> 02:48:06.779]  Because up here you've got all these families.
[02:48:07.279 --> 02:48:12.504]  But right up here at the top is the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the British Royal Family, and they're all intermarried now.
[02:48:12.944 --> 02:48:14.425]  That's how the Rothschilds are lords.
[02:48:15.186 --> 02:48:16.627]  They're all right up here at the top.
[02:48:16.927 --> 02:48:21.671]  And they will go into other countries and team up with the Lee family that's run China for hundreds of years.
[02:48:21.971 --> 02:48:27.216]  With the Mitsubishis, with the Hondas, with others.
[02:48:27.937 --> 02:48:30.238]  And so up here you've got all these elites
[02:48:31.448 --> 02:48:34.510]  And the British Empire was the model for covert control.
[02:48:34.791 --> 02:48:36.912]  That's who the puppet masters are.
[02:48:36.992 --> 02:48:42.756]  That's who controls the strings into the nation states and the petty regional elites.
[02:48:43.257 --> 02:48:50.702]  And all these petty regional elites, they get invited to CFR meetings, trilateral commission meetings up here in the next to the highest strata.
[02:48:51.062 --> 02:48:54.045]  They get invited up here to feel like they're all powerful and they're special.
[02:48:55.157 --> 02:49:10.259]  And so as this ruling elite at the very top set up their world government, set up their Agenda 21, set up their world rules, set up their world armies, set up through IMF and World Bank control of the nations, all their domestic police states that are over every country,
[02:49:11.704 --> 02:49:23.615]  They also bought up the media now to six big mega companies other than Alternative Press and they're getting scared trying to start beating the drum to shut down Alternative Media because we're exposing the real pyramidal structure.
[02:49:23.875 --> 02:49:26.998]  So George Soros is in the bottom layer
[02:49:28.203 --> 02:49:30.765]  Of the next highest level to the capstone.
[02:49:30.905 --> 02:49:40.310]  You've got the capstone with the royalty, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the less than 100 top families, the Astors, the rest of them, the Bundys, the DuPonts, they're all up here.
[02:49:41.090 --> 02:49:43.912]  And the DuPonts are at the very bottom of the top capstone.
[02:49:43.932 --> 02:49:47.514]  As you go up here, it's Rothschilds, Rockefellers, British royalty at the very tip.
[02:49:47.774 --> 02:49:48.715]  It's all compartmentalized.
[02:49:49.115 --> 02:49:52.437]  You look at Bohemian Grove, it's a pyramidal structure with 114 camps
[02:49:54.418 --> 02:49:54.618]  In it.
[02:49:55.139 --> 02:49:59.643]  And Mandalay, the most elite camp, has the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers in it.
[02:50:00.223 --> 02:50:03.726]  Below that, then they have camps with the Kissingers and the rest of them.
[02:50:03.926 --> 02:50:09.631]  And then people who are just CEOs of billion-dollar companies, they've got to sleep on cots.
[02:50:10.032 --> 02:50:13.054]  They don't get lavish, you know, log cabins with servants.
[02:50:13.374 --> 02:50:15.917]  But they're happy because they get to talk to these guys.
[02:50:16.237 --> 02:50:19.680]  And then these guys on top, they get to then influence Petal.
[02:50:20.060 --> 02:50:24.942]  And compromise all these guys, the same model they use with nations and countries and corporations.
[02:50:25.182 --> 02:50:33.486]  And let's say somebody comes up with a corporation, makes a bunch of money, a few billion dollars, they just come in and buy them off, or if they can't buy them off, they kill them.
[02:50:34.815 --> 02:50:44.262]  So, that's the real Puppet Masters, not George Soros, who in the pyramid is way down here at the bottom of the second level strata from the top.
[02:50:44.902 --> 02:50:46.023]  He's in the servant class.
[02:50:46.243 --> 02:50:47.464]  I'll come back and cover more of this.
[02:50:47.664 --> 02:50:49.205]  Glenn Beck, you're welcome to use this, okay?
[02:50:49.305 --> 02:50:52.608]  I dare you to talk about the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and the Queen of England.
[02:50:52.868 --> 02:50:53.849]  I dare you to do it, buddy.
[02:50:53.929 --> 02:50:54.629]  Okay, there it is.
[02:50:54.689 --> 02:50:55.230]  Real simple.
[02:50:55.390 --> 02:50:56.290]  Took about four minutes.
[02:50:56.470 --> 02:50:57.551]  There's the real pyramid of power.
[02:50:57.571 --> 02:50:58.412]  There's the real Puppet Masters.
[02:50:59.867 --> 02:51:03.148]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:03.948 --> 02:51:08.190]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:08.450 --> 02:51:14.391]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:14.611 --> 02:51:16.752]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:17.032 --> 02:51:23.014]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:23.134 --> 02:51:26.479]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:26.539 --> 02:51:28.241]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:28.421 --> 02:51:30.464]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:30.604 --> 02:51:35.271]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:35.491 --> 02:51:36.112]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:36.292 --> 02:51:40.338]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[02:51:40.578 --> 02:51:45.362]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[02:51:45.382 --> 02:51:46.543]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[02:51:46.563 --> 02:51:47.263]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[02:51:59.315 --> 02:52:04.179]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:04.279 --> 02:52:05.059]  What have we got?
[02:52:05.279 --> 02:52:07.421]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:07.721 --> 02:52:08.462]  A republic.
[02:52:08.742 --> 02:52:11.304]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:11.384 --> 02:52:13.305]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:13.646 --> 02:52:15.547]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:15.667 --> 02:52:16.948]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:17.348 --> 02:52:18.469]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:18.669 --> 02:52:19.070]  Children?
[02:52:19.290 --> 02:52:20.070]  Our education?
[02:52:20.411 --> 02:52:21.031]  Our money?
[02:52:21.231 --> 02:52:24.874]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:25.234 --> 02:52:28.898]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:28.938 --> 02:52:29.880]  You have been warned.
[02:52:30.200 --> 02:52:31.041]  We have the facts.
[02:52:31.241 --> 02:52:32.342]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:32.402 --> 02:52:33.284]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:33.304 --> 02:52:34.145]  We have common law.
[02:52:34.185 --> 02:52:36.447]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:36.708 --> 02:52:40.492]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:40.592 --> 02:52:45.398]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:45.558 --> 02:52:46.939]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:47.059 --> 02:52:47.900]  Don't tread on me.
[02:52:48.141 --> 02:52:55.009]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:52:59.073 --> 02:53:01.156]  A new way to improve your health has arrived.
[02:53:01.476 --> 02:53:06.442]  Your body's primary nutrient for detoxification and antioxidant power is glutathione.
[02:53:06.922 --> 02:53:11.668]  Glutathione mops up heavy metals and toxins of all kinds and carries them to the liver for elimination.
[02:53:12.168 --> 02:53:16.173]  Glutathione neutralizes free radicals, which keeps your cells younger and stops inflammation.
[02:53:16.613 --> 02:53:20.214]  Glutathione gives you a strong immune system and gives you greater athletic endurance.
[02:53:20.634 --> 02:53:24.635]  The problem is your body's natural production declines due to age and toxins.
[02:53:24.995 --> 02:53:28.316]  What's your body's best way to produce strong and youthful levels of glutathione?
[02:53:28.696 --> 02:53:30.656]  It's One World Whey Protein Powder.
[02:53:31.217 --> 02:53:33.897]  One World Whey Protein Powder is an industry first.
[02:53:34.317 --> 02:53:37.118]  It comes from grass-fed cows and is never heated.
[02:53:37.618 --> 02:53:45.505]  This miraculous whey protein powder supplies your body with the nutrient power to increase your glutathione production by as much as 64% or more.
[02:53:45.945 --> 02:53:49.989]  The increase in strength, energy, and well-being can be pronounced and amazing.
[02:53:50.369 --> 02:53:50.709]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:53:50.769 --> 02:53:50.949]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:53:50.969 --> 02:53:51.990]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[02:54:12.683 --> 02:54:17.365]  In my film, Endgame, we show this same pyramidal structure, but with a fancy graphic.
[02:54:18.145 --> 02:54:20.446]  But I think we're going to go into even more detail in the weeks to come.
[02:54:21.107 --> 02:54:23.968]  George Soros has been convicted in foreign countries.
[02:54:24.888 --> 02:54:28.890]  He's a globalist, but he's kind of a black sheep, so that's why he's allowed to be scapegoated.
[02:54:28.910 --> 02:54:30.051]  He's certainly a horrible creature.
[02:54:30.931 --> 02:54:48.179]  uh... but i went over this power structure this pyramid let me show you a photo of arnold schwarzenegger as he was running for governor at the palace of lord rothschild in england and so uh... there on one side uh... you see lord rothschild with the two puppets uh... you've got uh...
[02:54:50.888 --> 02:54:58.090]  Of course, the owner of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett there, who's a high-level puppet, but not in the top capstone.
[02:54:58.130 --> 02:55:01.250]  You've got Schwarzenegger, one of the minions that they were grooming.
[02:55:01.911 --> 02:55:09.272]  Okay, so there you see Lord Rothschild on the right-hand side of your TV screen with two of his minions.
[02:55:09.632 --> 02:55:11.433]  That's the pyramidal structure from top down.
[02:55:11.853 --> 02:55:12.733]  That's a microcosm.
[02:55:12.753 --> 02:55:13.693]  Let's go to another photo.
[02:55:15.174 --> 02:55:19.335]  And we'll continue to show you globalists here, people that are at the top of the capstone.
[02:55:19.375 --> 02:55:20.295]  There's the Queen of England.
[02:55:21.203 --> 02:55:24.206]  You know, they have all this media about how she has no power and all this.
[02:55:24.226 --> 02:55:28.669]  The lady owns much of BP, much of Dutch Rochelle.
[02:55:28.730 --> 02:55:30.171]  She's cousins with Queen Beatrix.
[02:55:30.751 --> 02:55:33.213]  She owns weapons manufacturers, you name it.
[02:55:33.253 --> 02:55:35.776]  Just untold wealth, she makes Bill Gates look like a pauper.
[02:55:36.216 --> 02:55:44.884]  Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, they give you a brand name, because 200 years ago the British didn't like having German royalty ruling them, so they changed their name to the House of Windsor.
[02:55:45.703 --> 02:55:47.084]  Okay, let's go to another photograph.
[02:55:47.104 --> 02:55:48.924]  So, that's top of the capstone.
[02:55:49.265 --> 02:55:54.587]  There's Queen Beatrix, probably as wealthy, but it's a state secret in the Netherlands, probably as wealthy.
[02:55:54.987 --> 02:55:57.468]  Her cousin, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha as well.
[02:55:58.248 --> 02:56:02.530]  Her Nazi daddy, Prince Bernhard, top eugenicist, founded the World Wildlife Fund.
[02:56:02.970 --> 02:56:08.753]  Now that's a top globalist, the top of the pyramid, and the head person at the Bilderberg Group.
[02:56:09.213 --> 02:56:11.414]  Okay, let's continue looking at who actually runs things.
[02:56:11.774 --> 02:56:13.015]  There's David Rockefeller.
[02:56:13.055 --> 02:56:16.516]  He's been called the Omni-Budsman of the New World Order.
[02:56:17.176 --> 02:56:20.198]  He's written books admitting he wants world government and the end of U.S.
[02:56:20.238 --> 02:56:20.758]  sovereignty.
[02:56:21.098 --> 02:56:21.418]  Okay?
[02:56:21.918 --> 02:56:25.520]  That guy is in the upper reaches of the very top of the capstone.
[02:56:26.280 --> 02:56:28.481]  That's, you know, the main Rothschild agent in the U.S.
[02:56:28.821 --> 02:56:30.202]  There's David Rockefeller right there.
[02:56:30.222 --> 02:56:32.023]  And they've intermarried with the Rothschilds and others.
[02:56:32.403 --> 02:56:36.925]  Now, at the next strata below them, at the super gopher imperial legate level,
[02:56:38.035 --> 02:56:39.656]  That's kind of the Darth Vader to the Emperor.
[02:56:40.076 --> 02:56:43.817]  Even more high-powered than Henry Kissinger or somebody like Soros.
[02:56:44.137 --> 02:56:45.398]  There's the big new Brzezinski.
[02:56:45.818 --> 02:56:51.720]  Okay, that's somebody beneath the highest capstone, but who the elites actually listen to when adjusting policy.
[02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:56.421]  So, in a way, he's got as much power as the top of the capstone because he's in there making decisions.
[02:56:56.601 --> 02:56:57.502]  Very powerful!
[02:56:57.982 --> 02:57:02.343]  In fact, he's almost a transition from the servant elite to the owner elite.
[02:57:02.403 --> 02:57:05.444]  He's almost in between because he makes so many decisions.
[02:57:05.504 --> 02:57:07.145]  Let's show you some more images here.
[02:57:08.106 --> 02:57:10.588]  I mean, we could show these to you all day long.
[02:57:12.549 --> 02:57:15.191]  And this is how they control society.
[02:57:15.772 --> 02:57:19.254]  And they had thrown the globalists down.
[02:57:19.274 --> 02:57:22.957]  1832, the British set up Skull and Bones, then they set up CIA out of that.
[02:57:23.417 --> 02:57:30.823]  Then they developed these families, like the Tafts and the Bushes and others, to be risen up throughout the power structure.
[02:57:31.880 --> 02:57:37.006]  So there's a smattering of Paul Volcker and Ben Bernanke.
[02:57:38.088 --> 02:57:38.748]  They're minions.
[02:57:38.788 --> 02:57:42.513]  But if you look at number three there, there's one of the Rothschild family heirs.
[02:57:42.533 --> 02:57:45.717]  Number three on your screen is the father of David Rothschild.
[02:57:46.197 --> 02:57:46.818]  Next to him is
[02:57:48.191 --> 02:57:51.914]  David Rockefeller, this is what somebody's put up as their idea of the power structure.
[02:57:51.934 --> 02:58:01.980]  I don't know if I completely agree with that, you know, that Lloyd Blankfein there and Ben Bernanke are even that high up on the food chain.
[02:58:02.461 --> 02:58:12.087]  Certainly a Kissinger or a Soros or a Volcker are making big decisions as economists for the Globalist.
[02:58:13.068 --> 02:58:16.090]  Or a Larry Summers, number 10, but no, they're certainly not
[02:58:17.284 --> 02:58:19.024]  That powerful on the scale.
[02:58:19.705 --> 02:58:21.945]  Two different separate animals, two separate groups.
[02:58:22.245 --> 02:58:26.906]  But again, I'll leave you with the pyramid drawing I did as we end this transmission.
[02:58:26.946 --> 02:58:29.467]  Coming up, I break down all of the incredible news.
[02:58:29.547 --> 02:58:36.368]  FEMA cams confirmed, Glenn Beck admitting that the government may stage terror attacks, and a lot more.
[02:58:36.648 --> 02:58:38.149]  See you back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:58:38.249 --> 02:58:39.009]  Great job, crew.
[02:58:41.058 --> 02:58:42.780]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:42.820 --> 02:58:44.202]  Web search FEMA camps.
[02:58:44.462 --> 02:58:45.644]  Web search FEMA camps.
[02:58:45.664 --> 02:58:46.285]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:46.325 --> 02:58:47.186]  And stage terror.
[02:58:47.226 --> 02:58:47.807]  Please do it.
[02:58:49.669 --> 02:58:50.250]  Hello, friends.
[02:58:50.290 --> 02:58:51.131]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:58:51.331 --> 02:58:52.673]  You've heard me talk about Calvin.
