[00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:08.788]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.448 --> 00:00:10.269]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:11.890]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.253]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.773 --> 00:00:20.876]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.337 --> 00:00:23.397]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:23.417 --> 00:00:26.600]  We are now 2 hours and 8 minutes into this worldwide broadcast.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.081]  We have another hour and 52 minutes left in transmission.
[00:00:29.782 --> 00:00:31.323]  We are simulcasting live.
[00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:38.962]  At PrisonPlanet.TV on the 24th day of March 2010.
[00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:46.888]  Here is an actual subsection of the health care bill that is now law.
[00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:53.452]  Now, Obama has sent the bill back to the Senate.
[00:00:53.472 --> 00:00:57.635]  He signed the bill, but they have a reconciliation bill they're going to try to tag on.
[00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.430]  Which is a whole nother bill, and has even more draconian legislation in it.
[00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.111]  But let me tell you what is in the bill.
[00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:11.612]  I've got a lot of calls of people saying, is there a national ID card in the bill?
[00:01:11.932 --> 00:01:16.893]  We already have, federally standardized driver's license, the Real ID Act, that is a national ID card.
[00:01:17.693 --> 00:01:26.735]  This ID card is different, that they're now going to be issuing to people, because, as it's phased in the next few years,
[00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:31.326]  Because the IRS has real-time access to your bank account to wire out funds.
[00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:32.607]  We're going to give you that subsection.
[00:01:33.067 --> 00:01:34.168]  Here's a document cam shot.
[00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:42.295]  And the IRS will fine you or fee you if you use your medical care for procedures that they think you don't need.
[00:01:42.495 --> 00:01:45.778]  Mainline medical tests, not just alternative medicine.
[00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.222]  Tens of thousands of new IRS employees, $10 billion every year.
[00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.584]  They were saying every two years to fund this.
[00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:54.225]  Now it's every year.
[00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.445]  And so this is now the nanny state IRS involved in everything you do in your life.
[00:02:02.485 --> 00:02:03.786]  A huge expansion.
[00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:10.473]  The likes of which we've never seen of this criminal agency that violates law and due process every day.
[00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:16.240]  Now this is from section B on page 65 of the bill.
[00:02:23.655 --> 00:02:28.659]  Section B, section I, page 65 of the bill that's now law.
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:48.875]  Eligibility for health plan and health claim status, the set of operating rules for eligibility for a health plan and health claim status transactions shall be adopted not later than July 1st, 2011 in a manner ensuring that such operating rules are effective not later
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.322]  Now, let's go over some good synopses of what's really in the health bill, and I've looked these up myself.
[00:03:19.377 --> 00:03:26.662]  Page 16 states that if you have insurance at the time of the bill becoming law and change, you will be required to take a similar plan.
[00:03:28.723 --> 00:03:32.646]  If not, if it's not available, you will be required to take the government option.
[00:03:33.026 --> 00:03:37.609]  Page 22 mandates audits of all employers that self-insure.
[00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:38.169]  Audits!
[00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.130]  Everybody gets an audit now.
[00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.131]  Page 29.
[00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:40.431]  Admission.
[00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:44.542]  Your health care will be rationed.
[00:03:44.882 --> 00:03:45.563]  It says right there.
[00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:46.323]  Comparative care.
[00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:47.624]  They will decide what you get.
[00:03:48.264 --> 00:03:49.024]  For cost-cutting.
[00:03:49.365 --> 00:03:49.945]  Page 30.
[00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:52.967]  A government committee will decide what treatments and benefits you get.
[00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:56.128]  And unlike an insurer, there will be no appeals process.
[00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:56.389]  Page 42.
[00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.211]  The Health Choices Commissioner will decide health benefits for you.
[00:04:00.691 --> 00:04:01.552]  You will have no choice.
[00:04:01.652 --> 00:04:01.872]  None.
[00:04:01.932 --> 00:04:02.112]  Page 50.
[00:04:02.832 --> 00:04:03.453]  All non-U.S.
[00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:06.634]  citizens, illegal or not, will be provided free health care services.
[00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:08.035]  Page 58.
[00:04:08.095 --> 00:04:10.957]  Every person will be issued a national ID card.
[00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:14.582]  And you just saw that from the same page.
[00:04:18.963 --> 00:04:19.664]  Page 59.
[00:04:19.724 --> 00:04:25.326]  The federal government will have direct, real-time access to all individual bank accounts for electronic funds transfer.
[00:04:26.626 --> 00:04:28.507]  And if you get health care they don't like, they fine you.
[00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.388]  And they could take your wages.
[00:04:31.448 --> 00:04:32.748]  I mean, this is all in there.
[00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:34.249]  Page 65.
[00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:35.890]  Taxpayers will be subsidized.
[00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.191]  All union, retiree, and community organizer health plans.
[00:04:41.018 --> 00:04:47.360]  Page 72, all private health care plans must conform to government rules to participate in the health care exchange, which is what they want.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.981]  It lowers the amount of care you get.
[00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:54.803]  Page 84, all private health care plans must participate in the health care exchange, i.e.
[00:04:54.863 --> 00:04:56.424]  total government control of private plans.
[00:04:56.784 --> 00:05:01.926]  Page 91, government mandates linguistic infrastructure for services.
[00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:04.387]  Translation, illegal aliens.
[00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:14.133]  Page 95, the government will pay ACORN and AmeriCorps to sign up individuals for government-run health care plan.
[00:05:15.574 --> 00:05:29.964]  In fact, will you go back and ask Aaron to go find the exact spot in Obama deception where it's the video clips of the president and, and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel saying we will all be a national compulsory service?
[00:05:30.845 --> 00:05:32.246]  People keep sending me emails saying that's not true.
[00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:34.548]  I want to actually play the clips for them of that.
[00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:37.410]  He could just send you the YouTube clip actually where it's at.
[00:05:39.858 --> 00:05:40.739]  Page 102.
[00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:43.621]  Those eligible for Medicaid will be automatically enrolled.
[00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:44.962]  You have no choice in the matter.
[00:05:45.402 --> 00:05:46.443]  You will be on welfare now.
[00:05:47.444 --> 00:05:48.745]  They will sick CPS on you.
[00:05:49.105 --> 00:05:49.926]  Page 124.
[00:05:49.986 --> 00:05:52.028]  No company can sue the government for price fixing.
[00:05:52.388 --> 00:05:54.690]  No judicial review is permitted against the government monopoly.
[00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.272]  Put simply, private insurers will get crushed.
[00:05:57.372 --> 00:05:59.133]  Well, if they're not part of the big top boys.
[00:05:59.794 --> 00:05:59.994]  Page 127.
[00:06:00.214 --> 00:06:02.656]  The AMA sold doctors out.
[00:06:02.676 --> 00:06:03.957]  The government will set wages.
[00:06:04.457 --> 00:06:05.438]  Page 145.
[00:06:05.478 --> 00:06:08.781]  An employer must auto-enroll employees in the government-run
[00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:11.493]  Public plan, no alternatives.
[00:06:11.513 --> 00:06:12.715]  1-2-6.
[00:06:14.878 --> 00:06:18.404]  Employers must pay health care bills for part-time employees and their families.
[00:06:19.165 --> 00:06:19.506]  Update 26.
[00:06:21.604 --> 00:06:27.747]  Any employer with a payroll of $400,000 or more who does not offer the public option pays an 8% tax on payroll.
[00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:28.988]  That's on your employees.
[00:06:29.948 --> 00:06:37.792]  Any employer with a payroll of $250,000 to $400,000 or more who does not offer public option pays a 2% to 6% tax on payroll.
[00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:38.412]  Page 167.
[00:06:38.913 --> 00:06:44.035]  Any individual who doesn't have acceptable health care, according to the government, will be taxed a 2.5% of income.
[00:06:46.016 --> 00:06:47.057]  Page 170.
[00:06:47.718 --> 00:06:50.662]  Any non-resident alien is exempt from individual taxes.
[00:06:52.003 --> 00:06:55.668]  The illegal aliens are always exempt because they want to have an incentive to bring them here.
[00:06:56.209 --> 00:07:00.454]  Just like they're exempt from paying their power bills in Austin.
[00:07:01.055 --> 00:07:02.857]  I mean, just total discrimination!
[00:07:05.583 --> 00:07:07.083]  Any non-resident, it goes on.
[00:07:07.883 --> 00:07:08.844]  Page 195.
[00:07:08.964 --> 00:07:13.845]  Officers and employees of government health care bureaucracy will have access to all American financial and personal records.
[00:07:13.885 --> 00:07:16.385]  It's all shared now via the IRS.
[00:07:17.605 --> 00:07:17.925]  Page 203.
[00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:23.446]  The tax imposer under the section shall not be treated as a tax.
[00:07:24.406 --> 00:07:25.307]  Yes, it really says that.
[00:07:25.367 --> 00:07:26.807]  It's a tax, but you can't call it a tax.
[00:07:27.147 --> 00:07:27.367]  Page 239.
[00:07:28.127 --> 00:07:30.708]  Bill will reduce physical services for Medicaid.
[00:07:30.788 --> 00:07:32.268]  Seniors and the poor will be affected.
[00:07:32.288 --> 00:07:32.768]  That's a quote.
[00:07:33.917 --> 00:07:34.997]  43 million a year cut.
[00:07:35.157 --> 00:07:36.378]  Raise taxes, cut your benefits.
[00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:37.158]  I gotta love it.
[00:07:37.858 --> 00:07:44.759]  And it's now in the AP today that it doesn't cover children and others with pre-existing conditions.
[00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:46.180]  It was all a lie.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.880]  Just a giant tax, and it's waiting for them to take over the system.
[00:07:53.161 --> 00:07:55.862]  The bill will reduce physician services for Medicaid.
[00:07:56.322 --> 00:07:59.662]  Doctors, no matter what specialty you are, you will be paid the same. 241.
[00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:03.446]  Page 253.
[00:08:03.726 --> 00:08:07.128]  Government sets values of doctor's time, their personal judgment, etc.
[00:08:07.168 --> 00:08:08.008]  Page 265.
[00:08:08.048 --> 00:08:12.071]  Government mandates and controls productivity for private healthcare industries.
[00:08:12.331 --> 00:08:12.071]  268.
[00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:18.975]  Government regulates rental and purchase of power-driven wheelchairs and puts a tax on them.
[00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:18.975]  272.
[00:08:19.075 --> 00:08:19.776]  Cancer patients.
[00:08:19.816 --> 00:08:21.297]  Welcome to the wonderful world of rationing.
[00:08:21.937 --> 00:08:22.698]  Page 280.
[00:08:22.898 --> 00:08:27.621]  Hospitals will be penalized for what the government deems preventable readmissions.
[00:08:28.848 --> 00:08:31.650]  If you don't follow all their rules, it's a $50,000 tax.
[00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:32.491]  Page 298.
[00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:39.417]  Doctors, if you treat a patient during an initial admission, the results in the readmission, you will be penalized by the government.
[00:08:39.878 --> 00:08:40.819]  Page 317.
[00:08:40.859 --> 00:08:45.102]  Doctors, you will be prohibited from owning and investing in healthcare companies.
[00:08:46.163 --> 00:08:49.186]  Yeah.
[00:08:49.206 --> 00:08:49.186]  318.
[00:08:49.686 --> 00:08:50.067]  Page 318.
[00:08:50.527 --> 00:08:52.148]  Prohibition of hospital expansion.
[00:08:52.469 --> 00:08:54.210]  Hospitals cannot expand without government approval. 321.
[00:08:57.509 --> 00:09:00.510]  Hospital expansion hinges on community input.
[00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.371]  In other words, get another payoff to ACORN and other U.N.
[00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:06.312]  rent-a-mobs, so they can claim it's for the people.
[00:09:06.852 --> 00:09:07.912]  Page 335.
[00:09:07.972 --> 00:09:10.553]  Government mandates establishment of outcome-based measures, i.e.
[00:09:10.613 --> 00:09:11.053]  rationing.
[00:09:12.454 --> 00:09:15.275]  That's comparative care.
[00:09:15.295 --> 00:09:15.275]  341.
[00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:22.717]  Government has authority to disqualify Medicare Advantage plans, HMOs, etc.
[00:09:25.486 --> 00:09:26.547]  Page 354.
[00:09:26.627 --> 00:09:30.071]  Government will restrict enrollment in specialty needs individuals.
[00:09:30.852 --> 00:09:34.576]  So it actually discriminates against those that are already handicapped.
[00:09:34.877 --> 00:09:37.700]  You're gonna get given pills and left on a gurney to die just like England.
[00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:38.741]  This is eugenics. 379.
[00:09:41.224 --> 00:09:42.645]  Telehealth Advisory Committee.
[00:09:42.986 --> 00:09:43.906]  Healthcare by phone.
[00:09:44.787 --> 00:09:45.247]  4th to 5.
[00:09:45.988 --> 00:09:46.769]  More bureaucracy.
[00:09:46.809 --> 00:09:50.231]  Advanced care, planning, consultant, senior citizens, assisted suicide, euthanasia.
[00:09:50.972 --> 00:09:51.733]  Page 4 to 5.
[00:09:52.113 --> 00:09:58.818]  Government will instruct and consult regarding living wills, durable powers of attorney, etc.
[00:09:59.179 --> 00:09:59.739]  Mandatory.
[00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.881]  Appears to lock in estate taxes ahead of time.
[00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:03.082]  Page 4 to 5.
[00:10:03.442 --> 00:10:07.806]  Government provides approved list of end-of-life resources guiding you in death.
[00:10:09.022 --> 00:10:10.043]  Page 427.
[00:10:10.123 --> 00:10:12.925]  Government mandates program that orders end-of-life treatment.
[00:10:12.965 --> 00:10:15.627]  Government dictates how you and your life ends.
[00:10:16.168 --> 00:10:16.448]  Page 429.
[00:10:17.969 --> 00:10:25.335]  Advocating care planning consult with the use to dictate treatment of patient's health directories.
[00:10:25.615 --> 00:10:27.837]  This can include the order for end-of-life plans.
[00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:28.978]  An order from the government.
[00:10:29.758 --> 00:10:29.978]  Page 430.
[00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:32.520]  These are all bioethicist directives.
[00:10:32.921 --> 00:10:35.863]  Government will decide what level of treatments you may and may not have at end-of-life.
[00:10:35.883 --> 00:10:36.864]  Not your doctor or hospital.
[00:10:37.944 --> 00:10:40.345]  4-6-9, community-based home medical services.
[00:10:40.385 --> 00:10:41.426]  More payoffs to ACORN.
[00:10:41.446 --> 00:10:45.088]  4-7-2, payments to community-based organizations.
[00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:46.869]  More payoffs.
[00:10:46.889 --> 00:10:50.492]  4-8-9, government will cover marriage and family therapy.
[00:10:50.532 --> 00:10:51.852]  Government incentives to your marriage.
[00:10:52.073 --> 00:10:52.893]  So now to healthcare.
[00:10:52.933 --> 00:10:54.254]  Oh, you want free government healthcare?
[00:10:54.514 --> 00:10:55.815]  You've got to go to a psychiatrist.
[00:10:56.475 --> 00:10:57.196]  And CPS.
[00:10:57.216 --> 00:10:58.356]  4-9-4, government.
[00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:04.133]  We'll cover medical health services, defining, creating and rationing those services.
[00:11:04.473 --> 00:11:06.514]  Well, it's a 2,700-page bill.
[00:11:06.574 --> 00:11:08.335]  Sorry, I've got to stop.
[00:11:08.355 --> 00:11:09.935]  I only went through a third of it or less.
[00:11:10.395 --> 00:11:10.875]  Sorry!
[00:11:10.895 --> 00:11:12.296]  I've got to stop there.
[00:11:12.336 --> 00:11:14.917]  I can't even cover it all with the time constraints.
[00:11:14.937 --> 00:11:16.377]  I've got other news and calls to take.
[00:11:21.099 --> 00:11:22.439]  And then there's all the new taxes.
[00:11:22.459 --> 00:11:23.340]  I didn't even get into that.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.181]  Let me read a few more of the taxes real fast.
[00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:33.585]  Excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health care of 40%, but the unions are exempt.
[00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:39.069]  Increase in additional taxes on distributions from HSA and MSA.
[00:11:39.849 --> 00:11:42.991]  An increase of 10 to 20% on taxes for money in health savings accounts.
[00:11:43.011 --> 00:11:47.314]  I mean, I can go on for hundreds of these if you want.
[00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:49.556]  Tax on failing hospitals.
[00:11:49.576 --> 00:11:50.456]  $50,000 tax.
[00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:51.837]  I just can't even.
[00:11:52.738 --> 00:11:55.900]  I just, it's, it's, it's, it's just, it's unspeakable.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.520]  I mean, it's just...
[00:12:03.417 --> 00:12:09.100]  As the economy continues to decline, Patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.561]  The world is changing fast.
[00:12:11.941 --> 00:12:13.402]  Are you fully prepared?
[00:12:14.182 --> 00:12:16.903]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[00:12:17.383 --> 00:12:27.648]  At PatriotFood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned meat for half price.

[00:12:44.297 --> 00:12:48.599]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:51.260]  Food insurance, just in case.
[00:12:51.861 --> 00:12:53.942]  Owned by me, Big John Lipscomb.
[00:12:59.167 --> 00:13:02.451]  Jim Newcomer with Midas Resources, talking today about change.
[00:13:02.671 --> 00:13:07.876]  Not the change we were promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in these changing economic times.
[00:13:08.097 --> 00:13:15.685]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion, and our unfunded liabilities totaling over $107 trillion, the value of the U.S.
[00:13:15.725 --> 00:13:17.607]  dollar continues its slide into oblivion.
[00:13:17.827 --> 00:13:22.252]  There's still time to ensure your financial security with precious metals, but you need to act today.

[00:13:31.663 --> 00:13:36.288]  With our government continuing to find new ways to spend our money at the expense of our children and grandchildren,
[00:13:36.508 --> 00:13:39.911]  There's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation with Precious Metals.
[00:13:40.131 --> 00:13:50.920]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we'll discuss how you can take physical possession or convert your IRA into Precious Metals before it's too late.
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:58.506]  800-686-2237, extension 104, and make the commitment today to retain the security you worked a lifetime to establish.
[00:14:00.513 --> 00:14:04.178]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:07.542]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:14:07.783 --> 00:14:09.185]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:14:09.907 --> 00:14:12.548]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:14:12.569 --> 00:14:18.792]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:14:18.952 --> 00:14:23.995]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:14:24.515 --> 00:14:34.200]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.381]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:14:36.622 --> 00:14:37.962]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:14:38.202 --> 00:14:39.083]  And the Congress is saying,
[00:14:39.443 --> 00:14:40.483]  Who do we make the check out to?
[00:14:40.644 --> 00:14:42.504]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:14:42.784 --> 00:14:47.606]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:14:47.927 --> 00:14:57.030]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:15:00.038 --> 00:15:01.359]  Four million people in the U.S.
[00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:03.180]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:03.821]  Fact.
[00:15:04.021 --> 00:15:07.384]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:15:07.724 --> 00:15:08.044]  Fact.
[00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:13.649]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:15:13.849 --> 00:15:14.189]  Fact.
[00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.353]  One in ten Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:15:18.673 --> 00:15:19.014]  Fact.
[00:15:19.254 --> 00:15:22.957]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[00:16:27.308 --> 00:16:36.676]  Well, out of a 2,700 page bill, I only got through, what page?
[00:16:36.696 --> 00:16:38.878]  600 and something.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.542]  I mean, this is so off the charts.
[00:16:43.622 --> 00:16:44.723]  It's so nightmarish.
[00:16:45.684 --> 00:16:46.745]  I don't even know what to say.
[00:16:47.185 --> 00:16:51.689]  And the country is going completely bankrupt.
[00:16:53.527 --> 00:16:54.907]  Look at this news.
[00:16:55.267 --> 00:17:00.308]  72% of Democrats, 84% of Republicans, and 80% of Independents think the economy could collapse.
[00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:05.450]  This was done by Opinion Dynamics Corp for Fox News.
[00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:09.690]  And there's similar numbers out of Europe.
[00:17:11.451 --> 00:17:16.112]  Meanwhile, sales of new homes dropped in February to lowest on record, according to Bloomberg.
[00:17:16.552 --> 00:17:17.352]  Lowest on record!
[00:17:17.372 --> 00:17:18.332]  This is a depression!
[00:17:18.952 --> 00:17:21.353]  And their idea is raise taxes on everybody.
[00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:25.165]  And, I have the AP here.
[00:17:25.646 --> 00:17:27.127]  I covered it at the very start of the show.
[00:17:28.207 --> 00:17:30.289]  Will you guys print that AP article for me again?
[00:17:30.309 --> 00:17:31.490]  I couldn't find it during the break.
[00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:40.596]  I think the headline is... Problem with health bill does not cover pre-existing conditions.
[00:17:43.518 --> 00:17:44.498]  Sales of new U.S.
[00:17:44.538 --> 00:17:46.620]  homes dropped in February to lowest on record.
[00:17:49.292 --> 00:17:53.694]  States sue over overhaul that will bust state budgets.
[00:17:54.194 --> 00:17:55.555]  They're saying it will completely bankrupt them.
[00:17:55.915 --> 00:17:56.795]  That's the name of the game.
[00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:57.935]  That's Bloomberg as well.
[00:17:59.596 --> 00:18:00.717]  Here's CBS News.
[00:18:01.057 --> 00:18:03.478]  Massive job cuts projected for New York City.
[00:18:03.818 --> 00:18:06.159]  They're going to cut 19,000 city jobs.
[00:18:06.979 --> 00:18:10.901]  But notice your taxes all go up because it all goes on interest of the bankers.
[00:18:11.621 --> 00:18:14.162]  This is just like Nigeria, folks, or Argentina.
[00:18:16.015 --> 00:18:20.117]  They're talking about, in Illinois, a four-day school week because things are so bankrupt.
[00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:24.099]  We're being totally looted.
[00:18:24.139 --> 00:18:25.039]  And the banks don't care.
[00:18:25.059 --> 00:18:26.039]  They'll just go offshore.
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.160]  They're already offshore.
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.901]  They've all had an exodus the last decade.
[00:18:30.722 --> 00:18:32.662]  They want to destroy our industrial base.
[00:18:32.682 --> 00:18:33.383]  That's stated.
[00:18:34.163 --> 00:18:35.384]  This is how they conquer you.
[00:18:36.844 --> 00:18:39.165]  Greece to default at some point, UBS says.
[00:18:39.465 --> 00:18:40.306]  Totally imploding.
[00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.451]  Portugal's debt rating lowered by Finch on finances.
[00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:47.591]  Portugal about to go under by design.
[00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:49.232]  It's come out in Goldman Sachs documents.
[00:18:49.272 --> 00:18:49.912]  It's all planned.
[00:18:51.052 --> 00:18:51.612]  Oh, I found it.
[00:18:52.052 --> 00:18:52.392]  AP.
[00:18:52.672 --> 00:18:55.373]  Gap in healthcare laws protection for children.
[00:18:55.953 --> 00:18:56.513]  Uh-oh!
[00:18:56.893 --> 00:18:59.494]  It says, and by the way, I've read the bill, it's not just children.
[00:18:59.774 --> 00:19:02.035]  They can refuse you for any pre-existing condition.
[00:19:02.075 --> 00:19:03.095]  They just give you Prozac.
[00:19:03.215 --> 00:19:04.255]  Literally, that's what they do in England.
[00:19:07.236 --> 00:19:07.996]  It's just, it's amazing.
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.601]  Your medical records aren't secure.
[00:19:10.661 --> 00:19:16.764]  Wall Street Journal admits that this gives it to every federal agency, they can do whatever they want, give it to private interest.
[00:19:17.164 --> 00:19:17.804]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:19:18.985 --> 00:19:20.226]  It totally rapes everybody.
[00:19:22.447 --> 00:19:31.031]  Healthcare effects start taking effect this year, though, on tanning beds, on taxes, on medical equipment, on your savings accounts.
[00:19:33.732 --> 00:19:36.040]  Yeah, an 8% tax on your medical savings account.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.729]  What, you get 2-3% in a savings account now?
[00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.993]  So you lose 5% a year?
[00:19:42.816 --> 00:19:47.620]  Meanwhile, separate issues, Supreme Court battle quietly brews over possible future nominees.
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:57.006]  Cass Sunstein writes lawyer documents for Harvard and Chicago Business School, on record, saying, ban free speech, arrest everybody.
[00:19:57.206 --> 00:19:58.027]  We've read those quotes.
[00:19:58.067 --> 00:20:00.469]  You cannot make up how bold they are.
[00:20:01.049 --> 00:20:03.911]  Hitler and Stalin didn't say they were going to do it, they just did it secretly.
[00:20:04.212 --> 00:20:05.532]  Here, they just say it out in the open.
[00:20:05.773 --> 00:20:11.357]  And these are the two guys about to be the Supreme Court justices, with two Supreme Court justices set to leave this year.
[00:20:12.518 --> 00:20:13.899]  Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:15.120]  What's Stevens?
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:15.120]  92?
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.901]  He's announced he's leaving at the end of the year?
[00:20:18.181 --> 00:20:19.622]  And the two guys, they're getting ready?
[00:20:20.042 --> 00:20:20.563]  On record?
[00:20:21.943 --> 00:20:23.644]  Obama's 9th Circuit nominee.
[00:20:23.744 --> 00:20:26.546]  Constitution must adapt to changes in the world.
[00:20:27.206 --> 00:20:29.187]  And this is the guy they're getting ready for the Supreme Court.
[00:20:29.347 --> 00:20:30.188]  Goodwin Liu.
[00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.191]  And he goes on to say we must adopt UN law.
[00:20:39.053 --> 00:20:41.114]  Ladies and gentlemen, I haven't even scratched the surface of the news.
[00:20:42.469 --> 00:20:43.390]  I'm just digging through it here.
[00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:50.835]  I mean, I read all this stuff, get ready for the show, and then I'm just sitting here, and I just can't believe this is actually happening.
[00:20:51.235 --> 00:20:52.596]  Look at these articles separately.
[00:20:52.857 --> 00:20:54.658]  Vaccines kill children in China.
[00:20:54.718 --> 00:20:55.759]  French news agency.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:58.661]  They're recalling them.
[00:20:59.001 --> 00:20:59.702]  Here's another one.
[00:21:00.622 --> 00:21:07.207]  Rotorix retrovirus contaminated officials say with a pig virus that can give humans cancer.
[00:21:07.227 --> 00:21:10.610]  And it says in the CNN article, retrovirus
[00:21:12.602 --> 00:21:14.483]  And then over a million kids are getting this.
[00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:17.286]  GlaxoSmithKline's product.
[00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:21.409]  Unbelievable.
[00:21:25.532 --> 00:21:26.593]  Unbelievable.
[00:21:26.913 --> 00:21:35.921]  I just... Every major... They've got vaccines that have been caught with cancer viruses in it, and the cancer viruses aren't involved in the manufacture.
[00:21:36.361 --> 00:21:37.402]  It shouldn't be in there.
[00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:47.176]  Remember the bird flu when they put weaponized bird flu in and shipped it out to 14 countries and thank God they gave it to lab animals and it killed them so they stopped injecting it?
[00:21:48.377 --> 00:21:49.037]  Oh my God.
[00:21:49.878 --> 00:21:50.779]  We're on the march.
[00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:52.880]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:53.801 --> 00:21:56.503]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:59.724 --> 00:22:02.328]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:22:02.728 --> 00:22:07.715]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:22:08.075 --> 00:22:09.797]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:22:10.118 --> 00:22:14.684]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:22:14.684 --> 00:22:15.164]  We're good to go.
[00:22:38.098 --> 00:22:39.079]  How much will you need?
[00:22:39.319 --> 00:22:39.940]  We don't know.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.141]  How much do you want?
[00:22:41.342 --> 00:22:42.082]  All you can get.
[00:22:42.263 --> 00:22:43.124]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:43.364 --> 00:22:46.127]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:22:48.189 --> 00:22:49.110]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:22:59.192 --> 00:23:04.574]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:23:05.834 --> 00:23:10.595]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:23:10.955 --> 00:23:17.757]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:21.859]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:23:23.759 --> 00:23:25.720]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:23:28.052 --> 00:23:32.075]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:23:32.795 --> 00:23:35.978]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[00:23:36.598 --> 00:23:37.459]  Others don't.
[00:23:37.859 --> 00:23:39.740]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.502]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:23:41.782 --> 00:23:44.344]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:23:44.664 --> 00:23:50.928]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:23:51.308 --> 00:23:53.490]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:56.032]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[00:23:56.372 --> 00:23:56.872]  Others don't.
[00:23:59.907 --> 00:24:03.569]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.932]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:24:07.152 --> 00:24:11.955]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:24:11.975 --> 00:24:18.199]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:20.601]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:24:21.101 --> 00:24:21.401]  Tim Geithner?
[00:24:21.421 --> 00:24:21.842]  Bernanke?
[00:24:21.942 --> 00:24:22.563]  They're arsonists!
[00:24:22.603 --> 00:24:23.884]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:24:23.904 --> 00:24:26.126]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:46.988]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:24:47.308 --> 00:24:56.418]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:25:08.566 --> 00:25:12.750]  I mentioned this yesterday, but I want to get back into it briefly.
[00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:18.575]  Then we're going to hear phone calls and a bunch of other news.
[00:25:39.053 --> 00:25:40.954]  Grayson can oversee Senate race.
[00:25:40.974 --> 00:25:43.175]  This is from the Associated Press.
[00:25:45.277 --> 00:25:48.098]  Secretary of State Terry Grayson can oversee the U.S.
[00:25:48.138 --> 00:25:50.780]  Senate race in Kentucky without any apparent conflict of interest.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.261]  A government ethics panel ruled today.
[00:25:55.703 --> 00:25:56.383]  You heard me right.
[00:25:56.523 --> 00:26:04.828]  Grayson, who is Kentucky's chief elections official, is running as a Republican for the Senate seat, being vacated by retiring Jim Bunning.
[00:26:07.037 --> 00:26:16.245]  One of his GOP rivals, Bowling Green physician Rand Paul, questioned whether Gratian should recuse himself from oversight of the race.
[00:26:17.206 --> 00:26:18.146]  And they went to the board.
[00:26:18.226 --> 00:26:19.988]  I talked to Paul's office yesterday.
[00:26:20.268 --> 00:26:27.454]  They went and filed this, and the board said, 50% Democrats, 50% Republicans, they said no.
[00:26:27.934 --> 00:26:33.039]  It's fine for the head of the election process to oversee his own election.
[00:26:34.192 --> 00:26:40.015]  And you've got all these employees that are guaranteed to be getting jobs in the Senator's office if the Republican wins.
[00:26:40.375 --> 00:26:42.357]  Rand Paul's ten points or more ahead of him.
[00:26:43.377 --> 00:26:45.078]  Dick Cheney's come out against Rand Paul.
[00:26:45.118 --> 00:26:46.859]  The Republican machine's going up against him.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.342]  And magically, this has never before happened.
[00:26:51.382 --> 00:26:56.785]  So now you can be an election official, and I guess that's the only way you can get elected now in America.
[00:26:56.805 --> 00:26:57.865]  You're the election official.
[00:26:58.286 --> 00:26:58.806]  You run it.
[00:26:59.246 --> 00:27:00.327]  That's kind of like Senator
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:12.492]  Hagel, when he first got in over a decade ago, 84% of the ballots cast in Nebraska were cast on machines that he owns the company for.
[00:27:13.173 --> 00:27:15.776]  So, you own the election machines, you become a senator.
[00:27:16.296 --> 00:27:22.303]  You are 10 points behind in the polls, but magically he could end up winning because he's the election official.
[00:27:25.831 --> 00:27:31.116]  There's nothing on the face of it that requires abstention, said John Stephan, head of the Executive Branch Ethics Commission.
[00:27:31.616 --> 00:27:41.506]  The unanimous opinion of the commission held that it is highly unlikely the Secretary of State, Kentucky, could influence the results of the statewide election without having the universal cooperation of election officials across the state.
[00:27:41.806 --> 00:27:42.547]  Not with computers.
[00:27:44.448 --> 00:27:46.410]  What we see in Florida in 2000.
[00:27:50.634 --> 00:27:51.575]  This is just incredible.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:28:03.328]  And then Kurt Nemo wrote a key article everybody's got to get and get out to everybody they know because if Rand Paul wins it'll send a shockwave across the nation for true conservatives to win.
[00:28:03.948 --> 00:28:07.571]  Are Kentucky Republicans rigging Senate race against Rand Paul?
[00:28:08.091 --> 00:28:13.515]  Very important article on that front.
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:19.600]  Okay.
[00:28:23.823 --> 00:28:38.988]  I've got a bunch of other news on naked body scanners, on police checkpoints, on the federal government to decide what you can eat, what you can do, not just the federal lunch program, the feds deciding what kids can eat, that's already happening.
[00:28:41.569 --> 00:28:44.690]  I've got cop program has cab drivers helping local police.
[00:28:46.371 --> 00:28:49.972]  I've tried to cover a lot of news today and I haven't even scratched the surface, but I'm attempting to.
[00:28:51.552 --> 00:28:53.213]  We're going to go to your calls here in a moment.
[00:28:55.399 --> 00:29:02.762]  I first want to tell folks that this can be used, all this open corruption and tyranny, can be used as a big wake-up call.
[00:29:02.802 --> 00:29:04.143]  And people are upset right now.
[00:29:05.163 --> 00:29:18.269]  I talked to my aunt who lives in East Texas yesterday, and she said that the meter reader was talking about me to her, just out of the blue.
[00:29:19.471 --> 00:29:20.392]  And now he's awake.
[00:29:21.393 --> 00:29:26.116]  And then she was in a town nearby at Walmart, only place in the country to shop.
[00:29:27.978 --> 00:29:36.224]  And two women randomly came up to her in separate events, talking basically about the New World Order and the takeover that was happening.
[00:29:36.264 --> 00:29:39.086]  And she didn't ask him, are you an Alex Jones listener?
[00:29:39.467 --> 00:29:40.327]  They probably weren't.
[00:29:40.367 --> 00:29:44.891]  The point is, it was just yesterday, just spontaneously, people running around upset.
[00:29:48.749 --> 00:29:51.830]  I mean, that's a gauge of how awake people are starting to get.
[00:29:51.950 --> 00:30:04.274]  So, it took time for folks to build momentum against the New World Order 20 years ago, but they planted the seeds that grew into what we see today, the Mighty Oak.
[00:30:07.961 --> 00:30:17.351]  Never before have people's minds been more fertile to be unlocked and to find out the truth of the planet, and who's really running things, and just how dire the situation is.
[00:30:18.192 --> 00:30:19.133]  Never before.
[00:30:19.253 --> 00:30:22.296]  So, I'm going to ask the listeners to not procrastinate.
[00:30:22.316 --> 00:30:26.040]  You may have handed out Endgame, Terror Storm, Fall of the Republic, Obama Deception.
[00:30:26.841 --> 00:30:28.062]  And it woke a lot of people up.
[00:30:28.422 --> 00:30:29.402]  Keep handing it out.
[00:30:30.082 --> 00:30:36.245]  And buy the two new films that also financially supports us that are available at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:36.665 --> 00:30:38.346]  Invisible Empire and New World Order Defined.
[00:30:38.806 --> 00:30:53.653]  You can watch the trailer, read the synopsis, it's about the shadow government, how the New World Order takes over countries through roundtable and front groups, what the globalists are into, their mindset, the eugenics, the stage terror, all the latest info, incredible interviews.
[00:30:55.606 --> 00:30:57.346]  Find out more at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:57.366 --> 00:30:58.807]  Pre-order at ships April 15th.
[00:30:58.887 --> 00:31:01.067]  And we're releasing two films in the same month.
[00:31:01.107 --> 00:31:03.327]  Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:31:04.228 --> 00:31:05.728]  Proves the FEMA camps are real.
[00:31:07.068 --> 00:31:17.650]  Proves the NORTHCOM takeover system, the torture, the underwear bomber false flag, the Hardin, Montana situation, the G20 police attacking peaceful populations using sound cannons.
[00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.210]  How they were federalized.
[00:31:20.931 --> 00:31:22.791]  It's got great music from Shooter Jennings.
[00:31:25.819 --> 00:31:28.864]  It is definitely the best of my four police state films.
[00:31:28.884 --> 00:31:33.892]  I haven't made a police state film in close to eight years, seven and a half years.
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:40.564]  And it debunks Glenn Beck, covering up the FEMA camps, all of it, on DVD.
[00:31:40.584 --> 00:31:44.447]  When you get both DVDs together, you get a $5 discount as the films come out.

[00:32:04.997 --> 00:32:07.038]  Two hours, 40 minutes here and haven't thanked any of the sponsors.
[00:32:07.058 --> 00:32:10.700]  I want to tell you about some of the great sponsors that I believe in that I think you should check out.

[00:32:31.809 --> 00:32:33.750]  It's like having your own

[00:33:00.123 --> 00:33:03.084]  Are you prepared for a disaster should that strike?

[00:33:08.638 --> 00:33:12.319]  The new Silver Solution is an important tool to help you arm yourself for any emergency.

[00:33:39.095 --> 00:33:41.776]  I know the callers have been on hold, but I want the callers to wake up right now.
[00:33:43.729 --> 00:33:45.490]  We're going to go to your callers one after the other.
[00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:48.152]  We've got Paul Watson popping in for about 10 minutes.
[00:33:48.652 --> 00:33:53.496]  In the next hour, I'm going to blitz through all this other news that we have here today.
[00:33:56.478 --> 00:33:58.339]  And guys, I was looking through my stacks during the break.
[00:33:58.379 --> 00:34:03.423]  It was an InfoWars.com article about the TSA to be secret police in America.
[00:34:03.703 --> 00:34:04.684]  Will you print that for me again?
[00:34:04.744 --> 00:34:05.104]  Thank you.
[00:34:05.925 --> 00:34:06.725]  I want to get into that.
[00:34:09.707 --> 00:34:11.188]  But let's go to your phone calls right now.
[00:34:11.248 --> 00:34:11.869]  Thanks for holding.
[00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:13.130]  Stan and Missouri are on the air.
[00:34:13.837 --> 00:34:14.417]  Hello, Alex.
[00:34:14.958 --> 00:34:18.901]  I just got through listening to you reading about the simplification of the healthcare program.
[00:34:19.602 --> 00:34:25.006]  If you understand history, this is the same exact plan that Adolf Hitler implemented in Nazi Germany.
[00:34:25.166 --> 00:34:31.851]  Yeah, his first takeover was government-run healthcare, euthanasia, health rationing, total control, and this is it.
[00:34:35.234 --> 00:34:35.834]  Yes, Alex.
[00:34:36.215 --> 00:34:43.040]  What they did was they got rid of the mentally retarded imbeciles, and what they did with the mentally retarded children, they put them on a drug called Limonol.
[00:34:43.806 --> 00:34:48.331]  And they put it in their tea to sedate them, and what it did, it put these kids in a coma and they killed them, Alex.
[00:34:49.092 --> 00:34:51.935]  And you said they wanted to ration health care to the elderly.
[00:34:52.115 --> 00:34:55.039]  They have to get rid of anybody that's non-productive in this country.
[00:34:57.221 --> 00:35:02.827]  Yeah, first they get you domesticated, they take your money, make you dependent on them, and then they kill you with the control.
[00:35:02.887 --> 00:35:03.969]  This has all been stated.
[00:35:04.289 --> 00:35:04.950]  It's all true.
[00:35:06.405 --> 00:35:11.393]  Our next crisis, Alex, I believe, rising on the horizon, and I believe it's going to happen.
[00:35:11.453 --> 00:35:13.536]  They never have touched on Social Security.
[00:35:13.636 --> 00:35:18.383]  You have 44 million socially independent people that live on Social Security.
[00:35:19.425 --> 00:35:21.288]  And, Alex, they're going to collapse it.
[00:35:23.959 --> 00:35:28.803]  And that's the plan, and then give you watered-down, horrible government health care and the bioethicist boards.
[00:35:28.923 --> 00:35:42.913]  I had what Wesley Smith on, Wall Street Journal writer, many times, and he covered Mr. Winland's case and others, where people are paralyzed, neck down, and are under government care, and they dehydrate you and kill you, as you beg for water and food.
[00:35:43.033 --> 00:35:47.316]  I mean, people don't know that the police have been torturing for decades under pain compliance.
[00:35:47.596 --> 00:35:49.758]  They don't know they're already euthanizing and killing people.
[00:35:50.558 --> 00:35:53.119]  The media never covers the cases where they can talk and are begging.
[00:35:53.459 --> 00:35:57.741]  You know, they covered Terri Schiavo because they could act like she was in a coma and try to sell the idea.
[00:35:57.921 --> 00:35:59.662]  That's why that case got so big in the media.
[00:36:00.982 --> 00:36:11.707]  In fact, pull up Wesley Smith, Wall Street Journal articles about, and he also wrote a best-selling book about, I mean, this list, the hundreds of names that he just covered where they murder people.
[00:36:11.967 --> 00:36:13.748]  We're not making this up, folks.
[00:36:14.688 --> 00:36:19.793]  And you've got Tom Daschle that wrote the bill writing a book about old people above 60 have a duty to die.
[00:36:20.093 --> 00:36:21.374]  You're not going to get eye surgery.
[00:36:21.394 --> 00:36:22.495]  You're not going to get health care.
[00:36:22.775 --> 00:36:24.317]  You're going to get watered down crap.
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:28.881]  Anything else, Stan?
[00:36:29.693 --> 00:36:32.357]  Yes, anybody that's non-productive, you're correct, Alex.
[00:36:32.377 --> 00:36:33.579]  That's who they want to get rid of.
[00:36:33.639 --> 00:36:39.447]  Limit the healthcare, get rid of the cancer, you know, because it's costing the government a lot of people that, you know, are on Medicare.
[00:36:39.627 --> 00:36:42.872]  It's in there that the government decides what treatment you get.
[00:36:43.633 --> 00:36:44.153]  And who dies.
[00:36:45.899 --> 00:36:48.101]  I mean, you're not going to get anything free from the government, folks.
[00:36:48.601 --> 00:36:49.542]  That's what people need to understand.
[00:36:49.602 --> 00:36:51.743]  How many times have they been caught lying?
[00:36:52.024 --> 00:36:58.148]  How much evil have they been caught putting cancer virus and over 200 million injections of the polio vaccine?
[00:36:58.388 --> 00:36:59.790]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:03.492]  Why do you think cancer is as common as the common cold now?
[00:37:07.615 --> 00:37:09.277]  I mean, they've gotten away with poison in the water.
[00:37:09.317 --> 00:37:09.717]  Why not?
[00:37:09.797 --> 00:37:10.778]  Stan, I appreciate your call.
[00:37:11.398 --> 00:37:12.959]  Steven in Florida.
[00:37:12.979 --> 00:37:13.360]  Go ahead.
[00:37:15.253 --> 00:37:15.973]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[00:37:17.074 --> 00:37:17.434]  Go ahead.
[00:37:18.094 --> 00:37:21.436]  Yeah, a couple things I just wanted to cover real quick.
[00:37:22.036 --> 00:37:31.860]  First of all, I just moved here not too long ago in Florida from out in Houston, Texas, and I had to deal with my sister who was living with my mom.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.120]  She was being very abusive.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:39.223]  So in the process, my sister called the sheriff on me five times just to try and make herself look good.
[00:37:39.263 --> 00:37:41.524]  Well anyway, I got her out of here, but
[00:37:42.096 --> 00:37:50.523]  What I wanted to mention was, one of the times that these sheriffs came out, they actually told me that this was my mother's fault for letting her move in.
[00:37:50.583 --> 00:37:58.290]  And I'm telling you, Alex, the look on this guy's face, he would have fit in real well with that group that was at the G20 in Pittsburgh.
[00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:59.431]  Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:37:59.471 --> 00:38:04.435]  A lot of cops now, when they come to your house for something, they end up arresting you for something else.
[00:38:04.776 --> 00:38:06.077]  They're looking for trouble.
[00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.450]  Right.
[00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:21.035]  And yesterday I was at the store shopping and I was talking to a guy working there about what you had gone over about this health care bill and listening to what you had gone over yesterday like you did today and reading the article that's on there with the 20 points.
[00:38:21.895 --> 00:38:30.498]  And anyway, this woman overheard me talking to him and she goes, well, shouldn't you just wait and see how it's going to all turn out before you start commenting on it?
[00:38:31.238 --> 00:38:32.799]  And she goes, have you read all 2,800 pages?
[00:38:34.426 --> 00:38:39.590]  I said no, man, but I've seen enough that I know that this is something that's going to totally bankrupt our system.
[00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:40.551]  Well, I mean, hold on.
[00:38:40.611 --> 00:38:42.772]  Hold on for people watching on TV or on the radio.
[00:38:43.132 --> 00:38:45.554]  We went over it with the sections of the bill.
[00:38:45.594 --> 00:38:46.535]  We have them in little sections.
[00:38:46.555 --> 00:38:54.641]  I mean, when I tell you there's a national ID card and the IRS is going to be in your bank account and be able to take your money, I mean, I read from the bill itself.
[00:38:54.921 --> 00:38:56.923]  It's not like I'm just here saying this.
[00:38:58.015 --> 00:39:01.919]  I mean, I just read the AP where it doesn't cover people with pre-existing conditions.
[00:39:02.279 --> 00:39:02.900]  Oopsie!
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.041]  Wasn't in the bill!
[00:39:05.642 --> 00:39:19.055]  Well, I had a lady come over to my mom's house yesterday that does her hair, and I showed her parts of the Obama deception last time she was here, and she's pretty on board with that, but her husband's an Obama supporter, and he's a local fireman.
[00:39:19.759 --> 00:39:28.882]  And so I told her, I'm going to send her a link so she can have him watch it online, but I also told her to go on the website and purchase a copy for him.
[00:39:29.382 --> 00:39:34.623]  But his response when she was just sharing the little bit she saw was, oh, so you drank the Kool-Aid, huh?
[00:39:35.363 --> 00:39:38.424]  I'm thinking, no, she's not the one that drank the Kool-Aid, dude.
[00:39:40.105 --> 00:39:45.806]  You know, it's unfortunate that these people are reacting this way, but that's why we've got our work cut out for us.
[00:39:46.826 --> 00:39:48.667]  Well, good job for taking care of your mama.
[00:39:49.588 --> 00:40:01.393]  Yeah, that's one thing about being an immoral society, where they encourage people to just warehouse their parents, not knowing that's going to happen to them, is that there is so much abuse of older people by their filthy children.
[00:40:02.574 --> 00:40:03.774]  We are a demonic country.
[00:40:04.855 --> 00:40:06.095]  And the demonic are taking over.
[00:40:06.335 --> 00:40:07.996]  There's still a lot of good people in this nation.
[00:40:08.916 --> 00:40:12.278]  But if you don't take care of your parents, you're the scum of the earth.
[00:40:21.311 --> 00:40:22.932]  Look what happened in Germany and Russia.
[00:40:23.752 --> 00:40:27.073]  Those people are a lot more moral and hard-working than Americans are today.
[00:40:28.893 --> 00:40:29.674]  And look what they did.
[00:40:32.375 --> 00:40:33.875]  Look what people go along with.
[00:40:36.536 --> 00:40:38.056]  It isn't just the health care takeover.
[00:40:39.437 --> 00:40:40.277]  It's everything.
[00:40:41.137 --> 00:40:42.338]  It's their evil.
[00:40:42.498 --> 00:40:43.398]  They're bad.
[00:40:45.699 --> 00:40:46.939]  And you're only alive once.
[00:40:46.999 --> 00:40:48.780]  And we're only in this place in history one time.
[00:40:49.793 --> 00:40:51.775]  All of you out there need to have a gut check.
[00:40:51.815 --> 00:40:57.499]  You need to get up off your hind ends, research the claims we've made here, find out it's true for yourself, and then make a decision.
[00:40:57.779 --> 00:41:00.401]  You can't just passively go along with it but say you're against it.
[00:41:00.781 --> 00:41:02.742]  You've got to take action against it.
[00:41:04.944 --> 00:41:06.245]  Rick and Georgia, you're on the air.
[00:41:08.046 --> 00:41:09.247]  Hey Alex, love the show.
[00:41:09.907 --> 00:41:11.769]  Look, I wanted to talk about this healthcare bill.
[00:41:12.665 --> 00:41:20.369]  This is the worst legislation ever because it's just going to open the floodgates for the next big bombshell that they're going to throw on the American people.
[00:41:20.909 --> 00:41:24.951]  Which is, and they don't care how many people don't like it, which is full amnesty.
[00:41:26.091 --> 00:41:27.072]  That's coming next.
[00:41:27.112 --> 00:41:28.112]  That's going to be the big one.
[00:41:28.673 --> 00:41:29.393]  No, they've said that.
[00:41:29.413 --> 00:41:35.036]  They're going to try to pass amnesty, total open border, and in it is a national worker ID.
[00:41:35.536 --> 00:41:37.077]  They just give it to all the illegals.
[00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:39.851]  But then, they're also exempt.
[00:41:39.871 --> 00:41:40.892]  That's in the health care bill.
[00:41:40.932 --> 00:41:44.835]  We have to have a medical ID card from the government and the IRS, but the illegals are exempt.
[00:41:44.895 --> 00:41:45.916]  I read the subsection.
[00:41:46.116 --> 00:41:46.836]  It's the same thing here.
[00:41:46.877 --> 00:41:48.518]  If illegals want it, they can have it.
[00:41:48.898 --> 00:41:52.781]  It'll be selectively enforced, but citizens have to have the worker ID card.
[00:41:53.782 --> 00:41:54.342]  That's right.
[00:41:54.362 --> 00:41:59.726]  And as soon as they announce that this amnesty is going to go through, we're going to get flooded with illegals.
[00:42:00.253 --> 00:42:01.794]  How do they think they're going to keep them out?
[00:42:02.234 --> 00:42:03.655]  You think there's a lot here now?
[00:42:04.075 --> 00:42:06.256]  There's going to be a whole lot more.
[00:42:06.396 --> 00:42:09.098]  Which further bankrupts those things.
[00:42:09.218 --> 00:42:11.219]  The government is about to go bankrupt.
[00:42:11.419 --> 00:42:12.500]  That is the goal.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.401]  That's exactly right.
[00:42:14.701 --> 00:42:20.524]  And here in Georgia they announced late last year that we already have real ID cards.
[00:42:20.564 --> 00:42:25.067]  They said that there was so much security in these new driver's licenses that everyone would get
[00:42:25.737 --> 00:42:31.581]  By January 31st, so that's done come and gone, everyone in Georgia will be getting these new cars.
[00:42:31.601 --> 00:42:34.884]  They said there's so much security in them that the state didn't even know.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.183]  Yeah, let's be clear, because they're under the Real ID Act.
[00:42:38.643 --> 00:42:40.045]  It federalizes your IDs.
[00:42:40.145 --> 00:42:42.067]  So you'll have to have that to travel.
[00:42:42.087 --> 00:42:43.669]  It's a hemispheric ID.
[00:42:43.729 --> 00:42:46.672]  It's under UN, North American Union parameters, publicly.
[00:42:47.413 --> 00:42:52.378]  And then you're going to have your medical ID cards attached to your bank account and your amnesty card.
[00:42:52.438 --> 00:42:54.481]  But the illegals, they're all exempt.
[00:42:54.581 --> 00:42:55.562]  I read from the bill.
[00:42:59.716 --> 00:43:00.596]  Spring is here.
[00:43:00.836 --> 00:43:01.637]  Growing season.
[00:43:01.797 --> 00:43:03.777]  The economy is not getting any better.
[00:43:03.997 --> 00:43:05.398]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:43:05.718 --> 00:43:06.378]  Think about it.
[00:43:06.678 --> 00:43:10.539]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[00:43:10.779 --> 00:43:14.260]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.161]  The country is running out of food.
[00:43:16.421 --> 00:43:18.982]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[00:43:19.242 --> 00:43:29.425]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you
[00:43:29.605 --> 00:43:29.945]  I think so.
[00:44:00.814 --> 00:44:04.483]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:44:04.844 --> 00:44:07.851]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:08.091 --> 00:44:09.514]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:44:10.194 --> 00:44:12.855]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:12.876 --> 00:44:19.139]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:19.259 --> 00:44:24.802]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:44:24.822 --> 00:44:34.487]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:44:34.567 --> 00:44:36.708]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:44:36.929 --> 00:44:38.269]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:39.390]  And the Congress is saying,
[00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:40.771]  Who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:40.951 --> 00:44:42.792]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:44:42.812 --> 00:44:47.896]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:44:48.216 --> 00:44:57.343]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:17.142]  Coming up next hour, I'm going to play Representative Dingell saying we have to control the people.
[00:46:17.162 --> 00:46:19.823]  That's what the health care bill is all about.
[00:46:21.223 --> 00:46:24.844]  I don't think this guy can even control his bowels, but he wants to control our lives.
[00:46:24.864 --> 00:46:28.345]  That was one comment I saw on the Brett Park website.
[00:46:29.246 --> 00:46:30.846]  You gotta laugh at some of this stuff.
[00:46:31.166 --> 00:46:37.549]  I also want to get into Mother Furious after in-school clinic sets up teen's abortion.
[00:46:38.529 --> 00:46:41.270]  Let's just... No, I'm going to cover that next hour too.
[00:46:42.346 --> 00:46:43.367]  I'm going to cover that next hour.
[00:46:44.887 --> 00:46:49.990]  There's just so much here, but I want to continue taking your phone calls here.
[00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:53.412]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Connecticut.
[00:46:53.432 --> 00:46:54.332]  You're on the air, George.
[00:46:55.753 --> 00:46:56.233]  Hi, Alex.
[00:46:56.433 --> 00:46:58.094]  I had some ideas.
[00:46:58.154 --> 00:47:05.838]  I think that these criminal families are the top 13 top families or whatever number of families they are.
[00:47:06.649 --> 00:47:06.990]  I don't know.
[00:47:14.437 --> 00:47:17.219]  That if they want socialism, let's have real socialism.
[00:47:17.259 --> 00:47:25.064]  Let's go after the 5% at the top, everything they own, the oil reserves, the land they own, the gold reserves.
[00:47:25.104 --> 00:47:30.347]  Well, the top 5%, people that make $150,000 a year are in the 4 and 5 percentile.
[00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:31.948]  You want the top 9, 9, 9, 9, 9.
[00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:38.813]  Because that top, you know, 1 out of 10,000 people, they have most of the wealth.
[00:47:40.919 --> 00:47:46.962]  Well, I thought there was a larger percentage there, but another idea I had, yeah, I thought it was a larger percentage.
[00:47:47.002 --> 00:47:50.863]  Maybe it's 1% or 2%, whatever they call it, but I thought maybe it was a larger percentage.
[00:47:50.884 --> 00:47:53.945]  No, when Obama says we're taxing the top 2%, that's people over $125,000 a year, or couples $250,000.
[00:47:53.985 --> 00:47:54.525]  They're in the top 2.
[00:47:54.625 --> 00:47:56.366]  I mean, most Americans don't even make $50,000.
[00:47:56.406 --> 00:47:58.367]  If you're making $100,000, you're in the top 5%, folks.
[00:48:09.039 --> 00:48:09.899]  Didn't even realize it.
[00:48:09.919 --> 00:48:12.240]  See, I'm in Connecticut and you're almost poor.
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.761]  I'm literally poor if you're under $50,000.
[00:48:13.861 --> 00:48:15.721]  I'm not kidding.
[00:48:15.821 --> 00:48:18.842]  Hey, in Manhattan, if you're making $100,000 a year, you're poor.
[00:48:19.883 --> 00:48:21.923]  In San Francisco, you need $100,000 a year.
[00:48:22.944 --> 00:48:27.225]  That's very middle class in Texas because of the cost of living.
[00:48:27.465 --> 00:48:30.526]  Because wherever you've got big government, there's a high cost of living.
[00:48:32.327 --> 00:48:34.988]  Another quick idea I had as a brainstormer.
[00:48:35.487 --> 00:48:56.390]  If they try to collapse the dollar, why not tell all the states they unite under a united front and don't let any federal tax, and what they do with the excess tax that they don't use for their own deficits or situation, that they buy gold and silver and refloat a currency that has a silver certificate of some sort.
[00:48:56.843 --> 00:49:02.268]  That way then they get all... they screw up the bankers who think that they have... Well, look, I'll go one further.
[00:49:02.368 --> 00:49:04.270]  I'll go one further, George in Connecticut.
[00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:12.517]  We need to identify the private banking families as the criminals, as the mafia, that's all they are, is a mafia that controls the banks and the issuance of currency and credit.
[00:49:12.797 --> 00:49:14.118]  No wonder we're in so much trouble.
[00:49:14.499 --> 00:49:21.124]  Identify them as the enemy and they've committed all sorts of crimes, not saying where the trillions are, and arrest a couple thousand of these people.
[00:49:21.385 --> 00:49:22.425]  We've got all the evidence.
[00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:26.929]  And arrest the people that staged 9-11, and we could turn this around.
[00:49:26.969 --> 00:49:36.236]  The problem is there's so many crooks right beneath them, that if you do that, they'll normally arrest the crooks above them, the communists and fascists always do this, and just take over the system.
[00:49:38.197 --> 00:49:46.964]  I mean, I figure you could charge over 100,000 people at the highest levels of government in corporate America, and globalists, 100,000 of them, send them to prison.
[00:49:48.237 --> 00:49:50.078]  I mean, just arrest their stinking butts.
[00:49:50.118 --> 00:49:50.878]  We've got the evidence.
[00:49:50.918 --> 00:49:51.778]  Give them a trial.
[00:49:52.618 --> 00:49:53.939]  But see, they control the courts.
[00:49:54.779 --> 00:49:58.681]  But if we identify them as the enemy, it can end up like Ceausescu's Romania.
[00:49:59.381 --> 00:50:00.241]  And that's my whole point.
[00:50:00.261 --> 00:50:03.162]  The government wants us to have a fight with the police and the military?
[00:50:03.362 --> 00:50:04.402]  No, we wake them up.
[00:50:05.003 --> 00:50:09.364]  Then we arrest the top 1% of a thousand.
[00:50:10.805 --> 00:50:11.285]  You understand?
[00:50:11.305 --> 00:50:12.445]  Right.
[00:50:12.885 --> 00:50:14.106]  But you do it through
[00:50:15.205 --> 00:50:16.046]  Due process.
[00:50:16.726 --> 00:50:18.907]  You don't have a French Revolution with guillotines.
[00:50:19.588 --> 00:50:20.628]  I appreciate your call.
[00:50:21.549 --> 00:50:22.930]  Then half a million people got killed.
[00:50:24.451 --> 00:50:26.872]  And then if somebody wanted your wife and you were poor, they killed you.
[00:50:27.973 --> 00:50:29.754]  Because a group of criminals came in and did that.
[00:50:29.774 --> 00:50:37.579]  We want to have an orderly restoration of the Republic and the arrest of the criminal revolutionaries that have taken over our government.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:44.303]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a
[00:50:47.841 --> 00:50:48.768]  Radio Network.
[00:50:50.987 --> 00:50:54.628]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:50:54.948 --> 00:51:03.070]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:07.831]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:51:08.431 --> 00:51:19.253]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:51:19.873 --> 00:51:28.896]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:51:29.396 --> 00:51:34.418]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:51:34.818 --> 00:51:42.001]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:51:42.301 --> 00:51:44.722]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:51:52.162 --> 00:51:54.084]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:57.487]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:06.575 --> 00:52:17.704]  Coming up in the next segment, transforming the TSA into a military intelligence operation.
[00:52:18.925 --> 00:52:26.077]  And that dovetails with my article about police around the country being trained for martial law and checkpoints.
[00:52:26.157 --> 00:52:27.459]  In fact, I moved that article.
[00:52:27.479 --> 00:52:30.525]  Will you guys reprint that law enforcement article I had?
[00:52:31.126 --> 00:52:32.147]  Because that ties in.
[00:52:34.031 --> 00:52:35.291]  All this other news I have.
[00:52:35.311 --> 00:52:42.794]  We're also going to get into public schools taking your 10, 12, 13, 14 year old daughters without your authorization for abortions.
[00:52:43.214 --> 00:52:44.334]  It's coming out all over the news.
[00:52:44.414 --> 00:52:45.394]  It's in the health care bill.
[00:52:45.414 --> 00:52:51.516]  I'm going to get more into some of the most important parts of the health care bill and next on the criminals agenda running our country.
[00:52:53.497 --> 00:52:54.097]  Their move.
[00:52:55.387 --> 00:53:00.230]  To have total amnesty for the illegal aliens and to pass the global carbon tax initiative under treaty.
[00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:01.551]  And that's in the health care bill.
[00:53:01.891 --> 00:53:04.153]  Over and over again it says to comply with UN mandates.
[00:53:05.073 --> 00:53:06.154]  To take over our lives.
[00:53:06.695 --> 00:53:10.137]  So that is all coming up.
[00:53:10.597 --> 00:53:14.620]  Paul Watson joins us in the next segment for what's happening
[00:53:15.888 --> 00:53:17.929]  Hey Alex, thank you very much for your show.
[00:53:18.029 --> 00:53:18.309]  Thank you.
[00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:20.551]  I'm a disabled Vietnam veteran.
[00:53:45.297 --> 00:54:04.889]  And what they do to us up at the VA hospital, there was a time there every time I would come into the VA hospital to be treated, I would have four or five police officers called to the rescue because I was a danger patient and I'm in a wheelchair.
[00:54:09.735 --> 00:54:14.117]  Well, I mean, we've seen the horrors, people dying of maggot infestations.
[00:54:14.477 --> 00:54:17.819]  This is the one area where government did run healthcare, and look how bad it was.
[00:54:19.019 --> 00:54:22.481]  Well, it's just the way they run things here, you know.
[00:54:23.241 --> 00:54:32.425]  I haven't had any drugs since 1973 in my system, and I had a nurse up there that was always giving me a hard time, you know.
[00:54:34.563 --> 00:54:40.144]  She would make me take these urine tests to see if there was any illegal drugs in my system, you know?
[00:54:40.604 --> 00:54:43.665]  I haven't had a beer in 25 years, you know what I mean?
[00:54:44.545 --> 00:54:51.526]  And one day I was there and I had to take a test because she was holding a prescription in her hand and then a urine bottle in the other hand.
[00:54:52.086 --> 00:54:54.246]  If I peed in the bottle, I got my prescriptions.
[00:54:54.346 --> 00:54:58.667]  If I didn't, the four or five police officers would give me a bad time, you know?
[00:54:59.547 --> 00:55:02.268]  And one incident that happened,
[00:55:04.736 --> 00:55:11.519]  I went and I took a urine test, went to get my prescription, and she told me I had to take another urine test.
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:14.061]  I told her I just did take a test.
[00:55:14.101 --> 00:55:15.341]  She says, well, I don't believe you.
[00:55:15.361 --> 00:55:16.562]  You've got to take another test.
[00:55:17.082 --> 00:55:21.244]  So I'm not going to argue with her, because I really need my pain medicine, you know.
[00:55:22.044 --> 00:55:28.607]  And I waited for the report to come back, because over the past five, ten years, all the reports come back negative.
[00:55:28.667 --> 00:55:31.749]  Well, that day, I took two urine tests.
[00:55:32.105 --> 00:55:32.445]  Okay.
[00:55:32.505 --> 00:55:36.609]  I was in the hospital 18 hours to get a bottle of pain pills.
[00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:37.650]  18 hours.
[00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:38.611]  Can you believe that?
[00:55:39.572 --> 00:55:41.314]  And I waited for the test to come back.
[00:55:41.754 --> 00:55:44.777]  One test come back negative and the other test come back hot.
[00:55:46.502 --> 00:55:48.143]  Now, how could that possibly be?
[00:55:48.643 --> 00:55:50.343]  Well, it's all about bureaucracy.
[00:55:50.383 --> 00:55:52.384]  It's all about contracts with private companies.
[00:55:52.964 --> 00:55:53.924]  Remember last year?
[00:55:53.964 --> 00:55:55.525]  In fact, I covered that article yesterday.
[00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:58.386]  Obama wanted veterans to have to buy their own insurance.
[00:55:59.066 --> 00:56:00.046]  They hate you.
[00:56:00.226 --> 00:56:02.007]  You can't pay them taxes anymore.
[00:56:02.327 --> 00:56:03.147]  They want you dead.
[00:56:03.187 --> 00:56:04.048]  They're eugenicists.
[00:56:04.088 --> 00:56:05.928]  They think human beings are garbage.
[00:56:06.188 --> 00:56:07.709]  The world only belongs to them.
[00:56:10.347 --> 00:56:17.754]  Well, I told them, I said, if this is the kind of life that I have to live, I don't want to come here and fight and be afraid to come here.
[00:56:18.214 --> 00:56:19.235]  I don't want to live at all.
[00:56:19.595 --> 00:56:25.901]  They tried to lock me up in an institution that I was depressed and going to commit suicide.
[00:56:27.222 --> 00:56:34.108]  You know, it took me almost... I had to file motions in federal court for harassment before they finally stopped.
[00:56:34.793 --> 00:56:48.084]  Well, they're putting most veterans now on PTSD list and you can't buy guns even though there's no law saying because some government quack psychiatrist says you're mentally ill, they just still label you basically as a terrorist and you lose your Second Amendment.
[00:56:48.905 --> 00:56:51.688]  News blitzes, Paul Watson and a lot more coming up.
[00:56:51.708 --> 00:56:52.208]  Stay with us.
[00:56:52.248 --> 00:56:54.890]  We'll be right back here on Genesis.
[00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:56.612]  Infowars.com is the website.
[00:56:59.175 --> 00:57:00.436]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:57:00.476 --> 00:57:05.819]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:57:06.059 --> 00:57:10.702]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:57:11.082 --> 00:57:16.165]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:21.368]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:57:21.889 --> 00:57:28.793]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:57:28.993 --> 00:57:29.893]  And here's the best part.
[00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:32.874]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:57:33.174 --> 00:57:36.474]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:57:36.794 --> 00:57:39.635]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:57:39.975 --> 00:57:41.875]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:57:42.195 --> 00:57:43.055]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:57:43.075 --> 00:57:43.295]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:57:43.335 --> 00:57:46.276]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:57:46.776 --> 00:57:48.516]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:02.102]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:02.503 --> 00:58:07.467]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:07.847 --> 00:58:09.569]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:58:09.889 --> 00:58:14.713]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:58:14.893 --> 00:58:15.834]  How much do you want?
[00:58:16.074 --> 00:58:16.815]  When do you want it?
[00:58:17.195 --> 00:58:18.797]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:58:19.077 --> 00:58:19.918]  When will you need it?
[00:58:20.158 --> 00:58:22.219]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:23.461]  Will there be any food?
[00:58:23.701 --> 00:58:25.002]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:58:25.202 --> 00:58:30.286]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:58:30.466 --> 00:58:33.669]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:37.572]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:58:37.872 --> 00:58:38.873]  How much will you need?
[00:58:39.113 --> 00:58:39.714]  We don't know.
[00:58:40.014 --> 00:58:40.935]  How much do you want?
[00:58:41.115 --> 00:58:41.835]  All you can get.
[00:58:41.855 --> 00:58:42.716]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:42.796 --> 00:58:43.197]  We're good.
[00:58:59.335 --> 00:59:01.316]  Man, are you urinating more frequently?
[00:59:01.336 --> 00:59:02.737]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[00:59:02.857 --> 00:59:04.437]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[00:59:04.698 --> 00:59:09.460]  I'm Roger Mason, research chemist and developer of the all-natural supplement Beta Prostate.
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:12.101]  And I want you to know about a free bottle giveaway.
[00:59:12.301 --> 00:59:15.583]  Beta Prostate helps your body support good prostate health.
[00:59:15.803 --> 00:59:20.685]  Your prostate affects the quality of your life, including your sleeping habits and even intimacy.
[00:59:20.925 --> 00:59:26.027]  Beta Prostate has plant sterols shown to support healthy urine flow and healthy sleeping habits.
[00:59:26.267 --> 00:59:35.170]  And Beta Prostate is so powerful, you'd have to take 100 Saw Palmetto capsules to get the same plant sterols found in one Beta Prostate.
[00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:38.071]  New customers can get a free bottle of Beta Prostate.

[00:59:54.578 --> 00:59:56.639]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[00:59:57.039 --> 01:00:06.985]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:10.587]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.587 --> 01:00:16.069]  Well, Congressman Hoyer and others are whining and saying they're getting death threats.
[01:00:16.509 --> 01:00:18.109]  Their children are getting death threats.
[01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:21.590]  People don't like it that they're going to fund killing other babies.
[01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:22.971]  They're victims.
[01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:26.112]  Democratic offices have been attacked around the country.
[01:00:27.252 --> 01:00:32.094]  Nine times out of ten, they catch people painting swastikas on their own dorm, putting the N-word up.
[01:00:32.214 --> 01:00:33.935]  I bet most of this is made-up lies.
[01:00:35.075 --> 01:00:38.216]  But yeah, you got 300 million Americans, 80% in the polls.
[01:00:38.256 --> 01:00:40.997]  It was 70 a week or two ago, are against it.
[01:00:42.363 --> 01:00:43.604]  They're always getting threats.
[01:00:43.724 --> 01:00:47.227]  I get threats as a radio talk show host every week, sometimes every day.
[01:00:47.247 --> 01:00:48.828]  Am I up here whining about it?
[01:00:51.451 --> 01:00:52.992]  Oh, the poor victims!
[01:00:54.593 --> 01:01:05.482]  Oh, they're a bunch of criminal, treacherous traitors, and they know it, and they know this lets the IRS take over your life, and take your bank account, and tax your medical savings accounts.
[01:01:05.582 --> 01:01:06.803]  I mean, I went over it earlier.
[01:01:07.524 --> 01:01:08.385]  This is so bad.
[01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:23.021]  I showed listeners here on air the actual bill where it talks about national ID card, but the illegal aliens are exempt from the national medical ID card.
[01:01:24.762 --> 01:01:29.564]  And now they say amnesty and the carbon tax, because they want to bankrupt the country.
[01:01:29.604 --> 01:01:31.205]  They want to get you under their control.
[01:01:31.445 --> 01:01:33.165]  They want to drive you into submission.
[01:01:33.926 --> 01:01:39.008]  In fact, I've got this clip of Congressman Dingell.
[01:01:40.359 --> 01:01:50.502]  I want to play right now, this is a clip of Congressman Dingell on a radio show yesterday saying we've got to control the people.
[01:01:52.163 --> 01:01:54.583]  This is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:54.783 --> 01:01:57.064]  This is all about controlling the people.
[01:01:57.144 --> 01:01:59.485]  Shocking audio of Dingell.
[01:02:00.325 --> 01:02:01.606]  You know what goes with the word Dingell.
[01:02:02.046 --> 01:02:02.946]  Let's go ahead and play it.
[01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:11.471]  You gotta love these computers.
[01:02:11.711 --> 01:02:14.934]  You gotta love these computers.
[01:02:14.954 --> 01:02:17.416]  That's why we want to save the clips.
[01:02:17.436 --> 01:02:23.060]  That's why we get in here early in the morning to save them to the computer and not play them off the web.
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:24.981]  But, again, I'm bad.
[01:02:25.201 --> 01:02:27.483]  I've just got to sit here on air and not have this, but that's fine.
[01:02:27.884 --> 01:02:28.544]  That's fine.
[01:02:28.884 --> 01:02:32.967]  We'll try to play that for people a little bit later in the show.
[01:02:34.469 --> 01:02:34.749]  Okay.
[01:02:36.101 --> 01:02:36.862]  Look at this article.
[01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:43.068]  Transforming TSA into a military intelligence operation.
[01:02:45.391 --> 01:02:50.536]  Obama's nominee to head the Transportation Security Administration told Congress on Tuesday he wants U.S.
[01:02:50.596 --> 01:02:55.941]  airport security to more closely resemble security at Israeli airports.
[01:02:56.242 --> 01:02:56.962]  Total tyranny.
[01:02:57.734 --> 01:03:11.277]  Checkpoints, you name it, on top of the naked body scanners, on top of being put on no-fly list for no reason, and he went on to say they want to deploy this nationwide into the cities.
[01:03:11.337 --> 01:03:20.339]  And last week I played video from Homeland Security where they show mobile 18-wheeler trailers to be at concerts, football games, everywhere, and at checkpoints to randomly
[01:03:22.537 --> 01:03:27.540]  Put you through interrogation under a brain scanner and a naked body scanner and ask you if you're a terrorist.
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.522]  This is actually going on.
[01:03:31.302 --> 01:03:36.626]  And now the Houston police are training to set up checkpoints with orders to kill any resistors.
[01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:40.088]  We have that article up on InfoWars.com.
[01:03:40.128 --> 01:03:48.293]  And a month ago, we put a story together out of BBC television clip that the Drudge Report linked to up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:03:49.209 --> 01:03:57.072]  Where a popular TV movie star in England went through the naked body scanner, the women recorded his genitals and had him sign it.
[01:03:58.353 --> 01:03:59.493]  And that's now been confirmed.
[01:03:59.553 --> 01:04:00.814]  Well, now out of England.
[01:04:01.334 --> 01:04:04.255]  The Sid and the guy two weeks ago that got arrested in Boston, Logan.
[01:04:06.616 --> 01:04:08.237]  He was a TSA naked body scanner.
[01:04:09.426 --> 01:04:12.128]  Reportedly had sex with a 14-year-old girl.
[01:04:12.428 --> 01:04:17.611]  This isn't the guy a month before that that told a girl in the TSA, I'm gonna bust you if you don't become my sex slave.
[01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:21.114]  It's not the guy that got arrested and went crazy and said, I'm God at LAX.
[01:04:21.794 --> 01:04:24.316]  It's not the guy that made the woman drink her own breast milk.
[01:04:24.616 --> 01:04:30.480]  It's not the lady that made the woman take the rings out of her breast with pliers.
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.143]  It's not the people harassing folks that have mental prosthesis.
[01:04:36.857 --> 01:04:46.393]  No, airport worker Perv over a woman's naked body image said, quote, I love gigantic bleepers.
[01:04:47.466 --> 01:04:51.670]  And it turns out she's an airport worker who had to go through the naked body scanner.
[01:04:52.711 --> 01:04:57.255]  And incident proves once again that detailed images of genitals are visible.
[01:04:58.096 --> 01:05:02.940]  And these are the people who will be leering over your naked children.
[01:05:03.461 --> 01:05:09.146]  And joining us from England, where this happened, the webmaster of PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:15.482]  Paul Joseph Watson, journalist, to break this down.
[01:05:15.542 --> 01:05:21.025]  Paul Joseph Watson, airport worker pervs over woman in body scanner.
[01:05:21.246 --> 01:05:24.988]  I love those gigantic bleepers.
[01:05:25.828 --> 01:05:27.689]  Paul Watson, break down what's happening here.
[01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:29.910]  Hello Alex, good to be back.
[01:05:30.471 --> 01:05:31.031]  Good to have you.
[01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:40.136]  Yeah, what's happening is these scanners were hastily justified and introduced with
[01:05:40.885 --> 01:05:46.228]  Primarily three guarantees from the government and this was the same in the US as it was in the UK.
[01:05:47.148 --> 01:05:57.874]  And these guarantees, these promises, were all designed to pacify dissent and prevent people from getting het up about what these body scanners could do.
[01:05:58.815 --> 01:06:08.460]  The number one was they said the body scanners don't show detailed images of genitalia and we were shown through the media
[01:06:09.778 --> 01:06:15.681]  These images of amorphous matchstick men, as if those were the images produced by the scanners.
[01:06:17.082 --> 01:06:32.571]  Now, even before the scanners were introduced, the creators, the makers of the scanners in Germany and Australia said outright, the scanners don't work properly if you blur out sensitive images of the body.
[01:06:33.331 --> 01:06:36.933]  And German security advisor Hans Detlef Daut
[01:06:37.594 --> 01:06:43.777]  You had images on the TSA's own website, examples of images produced by the scanners, and they clearly show that genitals are visible.
[01:06:59.736 --> 01:07:05.299]  Now you have this incident today, not to mention the one last month, which Heathrow denied.
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.281]  The Indian film star never recanted.
[01:07:08.661 --> 01:07:28.333]  And now at the same airport again, you've got this airport security official taking images of his colleague, 29-year-old woman, going through the scanner, perving over it, leering over it, and saying, you know, as he said, I love these gigantic bleepers.
[01:07:29.502 --> 01:07:42.451]  So it proves that the claim they don't show details of genitalia is yet another example of mass public deception which was foisted upon us to get these scanners hastily introduced.
[01:07:43.311 --> 01:07:47.034]  Number two, they said the scanners could not store and send images.
[01:07:47.594 --> 01:07:49.015]  Again, a complete lie.
[01:07:49.696 --> 01:07:57.021]  The Electronic Privacy Information Center has got the documents from the schematics of the scanners that show
[01:07:57.836 --> 01:08:06.319]  That you can create an administrative level which allows you to send and store the images and they're now presenting that information in court.
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:09.981]  So again, another proven lie by the government.
[01:08:10.021 --> 01:08:18.244]  Number three, they said that the scanners would be operated and this was guaranteed by the UK Transport Secretary, Lord Adonis.
[01:08:18.917 --> 01:08:23.921]  They would be operated by well-trained and professional security staff who wouldn't abuse them.
[01:08:24.441 --> 01:08:26.643]  And they're saying there's no problem with this, Paul.
[01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:33.048]  The AP reports, as well as AFP, warning for man accused over airport breast x-ray.
[01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:35.090]  No big deal.
[01:08:35.130 --> 01:08:38.753]  But if people want to read the full details, it's at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:38.773 --> 01:08:39.894]  But I mean, think about this.
[01:08:40.014 --> 01:08:42.496]  Laptops watching kids that the government
[01:08:43.902 --> 01:08:58.468]  Federal government pays schools to give them when they're at home, watching the parents in their bedrooms, over the laptops, face scanning cameras everywhere, mobile TSA trucks going out, now to be a new domestic law enforcement federal police.
[01:08:59.409 --> 01:09:00.869]  They're recording these images.
[01:09:00.929 --> 01:09:03.050]  How do they record them to save them for the news media?
[01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:08.413]  Now it's admitted in internal documents that the genitals is what they look at to make sure it's focused.
[01:09:08.953 --> 01:09:15.418]  It's like when you have a camera focusing on somebody's face, you make sure the cracks at the edges of their eyes, their crow's feet, are visible.
[01:09:16.078 --> 01:09:16.939]  That that's part of it.
[01:09:17.199 --> 01:09:25.886]  And that they do record the images, and they do save them, and it's really a biometric scan of the body, now going in courthouses.
[01:09:26.246 --> 01:09:30.029]  And the Chicago Tribune, in fact, dig that article out, I had it here in my stack,
[01:09:30.549 --> 01:09:38.552]  Here it is, the Chicago Tribune reports, TSA says eventually, headline, body scans eventually mandatory.
[01:09:38.932 --> 01:09:43.134]  TSA official says, England's already announced they're now mandatory.
[01:09:43.554 --> 01:09:45.654]  They will record your wife and children.
[01:09:46.035 --> 01:09:51.837]  And by the way, now let's talk about your girlfriend slash fiance, who's too shy to come on the show.
[01:09:53.258 --> 01:09:57.382]  Again, first take your shoes off, open your laptop up, let us touch you.
[01:09:57.722 --> 01:10:05.630]  Now, and I've seen it on the news, we have clips of it, they grab the breasts, they squeeze them, they grab your testicles on television, they squeeze them.
[01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:06.911]  On the news they show this.
[01:10:07.392 --> 01:10:09.174]  Women grab men, men grab women.
[01:10:09.774 --> 01:10:16.760]  And of course perverts are flocking and getting busted constantly raping children on the side, because this is where you get to squeeze women's breasts.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.982]  Perverts, you know, want to force it.
[01:10:20.442 --> 01:10:22.364]  Men want the women to want them.
[01:10:22.624 --> 01:10:26.267]  But these are perverts, and literally, what happened to your girlfriend?
[01:10:27.868 --> 01:10:29.509]  Well, I mean that's the case.
[01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:35.274]  Airport security attracts perverts, like, you know, excrement attracts flies.
[01:10:35.974 --> 01:10:39.217]  Half the time my girlfriend goes through airport security,
[01:10:40.006 --> 01:10:45.788]  She's treated in a manner that would constitute sexual harassment in any other context.
[01:10:46.748 --> 01:10:54.511]  What they've done to make people accept the body scanners is to make the other option, you know, the pat down.
[01:10:55.252 --> 01:10:59.253]  In Britain, you don't even get an alternative option if they ask you to go through the scanner.
[01:10:59.773 --> 01:11:01.674]  But in other countries with the pat down,
[01:11:02.526 --> 01:11:07.593]  They've merely made the pat down about a thousand times more intrusive than it was before.
[01:11:07.873 --> 01:11:09.035]  And I've seen this on the news.
[01:11:09.075 --> 01:11:18.166]  They grab each breast and squeeze, then they go rub underneath them, and then they stick their hand right up between and just... Let me make sure those are testicles.
[01:11:18.186 --> 01:11:20.109]  Let me make sure that's a woman there.
[01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.351]  Yeah, I like this job.
[01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:23.952]  I mean, this is so sick, Paul.
[01:11:24.333 --> 01:11:29.737]  I mean, again, it's an act of psychological warfare, an act of submission to make sure we fully capitulate.
[01:11:30.157 --> 01:11:33.580]  And now they want to take blood at DMVs to get driver's license.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:37.823]  It's now federal law under executive order that has not been implemented.
[01:11:38.183 --> 01:11:38.584]  Stay there.
[01:11:38.624 --> 01:11:39.525]  Let's talk about it more.
[01:11:39.845 --> 01:11:44.831]  What it's like for your girlfriend to fly, to travel, and they're just waiting because she's good-looking.
[01:11:45.251 --> 01:11:52.740]  They're just waiting, saying, oh... I mean, imagine if the Nazis were squeezing women's breasts and grabbing men's genitals.
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:54.182]  Oh, those dirty Nazis.
[01:11:54.442 --> 01:11:55.423]  What they do in the U.S.
[01:11:55.463 --> 01:11:58.046]  and England, all for the perverts.
[01:11:59.557 --> 01:12:03.199]  The mighty Roman soldier was given a daily ration of fermented fish oil.
[01:12:03.559 --> 01:12:08.161]  The stoic Scandinavian Viking had a drum of fermenting cod livers outside the door of his home.
[01:12:08.581 --> 01:12:11.503]  And Grandma always had cod liver oil in the cupboard.
[01:12:11.803 --> 01:12:16.305]  Today, Green Pasture Products, a family-owned business, provides high-quality nutrient-dense
[01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:17.026]  It's a good idea.
[01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:37.086]  Green Pasture's products are clean, independently tested for impurities.
[01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:39.748]  Made in the USA and come in capsules or liquids.

[01:13:00.493 --> 01:13:04.161]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:13:04.521 --> 01:13:07.527]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:13:07.768 --> 01:13:09.191]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:13:09.887 --> 01:13:12.549]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:13:12.569 --> 01:13:18.794]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:13:18.934 --> 01:13:23.958]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:13:24.498 --> 01:13:34.205]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:13:34.265 --> 01:13:36.367]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:13:36.607 --> 01:13:37.948]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:13:38.188 --> 01:13:39.069]  And the Congress is saying,
[01:13:39.429 --> 01:13:40.450]  Who do we make the check out to?
[01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:42.471]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:47.595]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:13:47.895 --> 01:13:57.021]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:14:28.544 --> 01:14:29.725]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:14:29.885 --> 01:14:34.229]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:14:34.389 --> 01:14:34.589]  I think so.
[01:14:58.832 --> 01:15:00.474]  Great news for pure water lovers!
[01:15:00.614 --> 01:15:03.176]  The Big Berkey Water Filter is available once again!
[01:15:03.456 --> 01:15:06.779]  And stay tuned to hear about a valuable offer from Berkey Water Filters.
[01:15:07.019 --> 01:15:10.262]  Choosing the right water purification system can be a daunting task.

[01:15:24.133 --> 01:15:28.935]  They remove harmful pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and unhealthy chemicals like chlorine.
[01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:35.478]  And, Berkey water filter systems are powerful enough to purify both treated and untreated water, like stagnant ponds.
[01:15:35.678 --> 01:15:39.580]  Get the gold standard in water filters at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:45.463]  For a limited time, choose a free shower filter, fluoride filters, or two Sport Berkey bottles with every system purchased.
[01:15:45.743 --> 01:15:48.928]  And GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems.
[01:15:49.028 --> 01:15:51.492]  Details at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:15:51.532 --> 01:15:52.133]  That's 1-877-99-BER-KEY.
[01:16:06.658 --> 01:16:08.860]  You know, my wife's always wanting to fly places.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:17.129]  And I just said, look, we're going to have to... When I do take a vacation, rent an RV or something, we can't ever go to the Caribbean with the kids.
[01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:18.731]  We can't ever fly.
[01:16:19.071 --> 01:16:27.960]  I physically cannot watch my son and my two daughters with big fat perverts, naked body scanning them and groping their genitals.
[01:16:28.721 --> 01:16:28.941]  Well, it...
[01:16:54.432 --> 01:16:58.393]  It's not just sexual groping, going back to the pat-downs.
[01:16:58.893 --> 01:17:00.834]  It's literally torture light.
[01:17:01.554 --> 01:17:11.717]  When she went through the security at Zurich Airport a few weeks ago, she said it physically hurt her when they were doing the squeezing and groping.
[01:17:12.097 --> 01:17:15.178]  So it's gone even beyond sexual perversion.
[01:17:15.218 --> 01:17:16.718]  It's like pain compliance.
[01:17:16.818 --> 01:17:20.059]  It's like something that corrupt cops that do with tasers.
[01:17:21.099 --> 01:17:23.440]  But another instance, we went through
[01:17:23.965 --> 01:17:34.451]  Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport last year after getting back from China, which in comparison with UK and US airports is like Nirvana.
[01:17:34.851 --> 01:17:37.032]  They treat you nice, you get straight through.
[01:17:38.213 --> 01:17:40.134]  We got to Paris Charles de Gaulle.
[01:17:42.275 --> 01:17:49.960]  We had to spend a thousand pounds to buy our tickets again because we were a security threat because we wanted to get through into the
[01:17:51.081 --> 01:17:51.721]  We're good to go.
[01:18:20.089 --> 01:18:32.515]  Her bag has gone through the scanner, and these Air France employees are rifling through her bag while making sexually lewd comments about, oh, you're attractive, I'd like to go out with you.
[01:18:33.736 --> 01:18:35.177]  And that's just another instance.
[01:18:35.237 --> 01:18:39.519]  So, every time she goes through an airport, she gets sexually harassed.
[01:18:40.339 --> 01:18:48.083]  Now, what seems to happen is that, you know, even if you believe Arab terrorists are running around everywhere that aren't federal informants,
[01:18:49.011 --> 01:19:01.295]  Their main targets for airport security are attractive women and old men in wheelchairs that particularly get off on harassing and humiliating old men in wheelchairs.
[01:19:01.475 --> 01:19:07.477]  And by the way, I even have a CBS News report that we posted up at PrisonPlanet.com earlier in the week where they admit that.
[01:19:08.397 --> 01:19:12.480]  Yeah, the twist in the article today shows the old man in the wheelchair
[01:19:32.099 --> 01:19:36.644]  He gets his pants pulled down to his ankles during the pat-down.
[01:19:37.004 --> 01:19:38.606]  And he said, why are you doing this?
[01:19:38.886 --> 01:19:40.688]  And the woman goes, I have power!
[01:19:41.168 --> 01:19:42.069]  I have power!
[01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:43.511]  I have power!
[01:19:43.831 --> 01:19:47.715]  While beating a chest like some kind of demented silverback ape.
[01:19:48.904 --> 01:19:55.706]  And as you mentioned before, other TSA agents are being caught on coke binges screaming, I am God, I am God.
[01:19:55.726 --> 01:19:59.668]  There was a case with a guy caught molesting a teenage girl.
[01:19:59.948 --> 01:20:01.728]  These things happen every single week.
[01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:07.070]  There was a case where they took the guy and got his email password and started reading his emails.
[01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:15.033]  They're all thugs and they're all attracted to this control freak sexual perversion and airport security allows them to express that.
[01:20:15.672 --> 01:20:29.636]  Whereas in the UK, people who take photographs of their own fully clothed children in shopping malls are approached and harassed by police and charged with being accused of being suspected pedophiles.
[01:20:30.076 --> 01:20:41.620]  So, you know, ogling naked kids is okay if you're in a position of authority, but if you want to take a photograph of your own child on a ride, then you're a pedophile.
[01:20:42.964 --> 01:20:50.046]  Or if you take a photo of your daughter in a swimsuit when she's five, they arrested the member of the military because his wife mailed it to him.
[01:20:50.426 --> 01:20:53.466]  I mean, it's just, again, it is a criminal government.
[01:20:53.506 --> 01:20:57.707]  They're recruiting more and more scum, and they now go, we have a criminal government?
[01:20:57.968 --> 01:20:59.268]  Move against the population.
[01:20:59.788 --> 01:21:01.928]  And now we have the videos and the news releases.
[01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:03.709]  Nemo wrote a story about it today.
[01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:07.787]  Transforming TSA into a military intelligence operation.
[01:21:08.067 --> 01:21:13.228]  Says they're tracking everybody's cell phones now when you come in by name without asking you.
[01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:14.968]  The British government admits they're doing that too.
[01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:17.169]  They're searching everyone.
[01:21:17.809 --> 01:21:19.769]  They're putting them on lists for no reason.
[01:21:20.549 --> 01:21:22.470]  They're just totally controlling everything.
[01:21:23.150 --> 01:21:27.351]  And now it's going to go mobile all over Europe and the United States, England and Canada.
[01:21:28.996 --> 01:21:34.338]  I mean, this is a criminal group and they're training citizens to line up and be frisked and squeezed and searched.
[01:21:34.619 --> 01:21:37.520]  They're training the cops and the TSA goons to do it.
[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:41.482]  Paul Watson, God bless you, appreciate you coming on.
[01:21:41.742 --> 01:21:45.223]  You know, I don't fly now with my family because of this, but now I won't be able to drive.
[01:21:45.643 --> 01:21:47.244]  Then they want to come do home inspections.
[01:21:47.344 --> 01:21:48.665]  We're here to squeeze your breast!
[01:21:49.365 --> 01:21:50.305]  We're on the march.
[01:21:50.766 --> 01:21:52.386]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:53.287 --> 01:21:55.988]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:58.721 --> 01:22:03.986]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:22:04.046 --> 01:22:06.768]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:22:06.808 --> 01:22:11.272]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:22:12.132 --> 01:22:16.596]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfallWars.com.
[01:22:16.616 --> 01:22:21.140]  We also have some specials when you get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.

[01:22:32.766 --> 01:22:34.346]  This film needs to be seen.

[01:22:46.572 --> 01:22:47.313]  Shadow Government.
[01:22:47.993 --> 01:22:49.354]  It gives Big Brother a black eye.
[01:22:50.194 --> 01:22:56.982]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:23:00.446 --> 01:23:04.111]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:23:04.471 --> 01:23:07.475]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:23:07.715 --> 01:23:09.137]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:12.519]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:18.722]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:23:18.883 --> 01:23:24.405]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:23:24.425 --> 01:23:34.070]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:23:34.170 --> 01:23:36.291]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:23:36.531 --> 01:23:37.851]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:23:38.111 --> 01:23:40.392]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:23:40.572 --> 01:23:42.432]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:23:42.713 --> 01:23:47.514]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:23:47.834 --> 01:23:52.635]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:24:04.406 --> 01:24:06.428]  Do you care as much about your air and water?

[01:24:28.445 --> 01:24:37.711]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:24:37.771 --> 01:24:38.512]  This capitalism?
[01:24:38.552 --> 01:24:44.696]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:24:44.816 --> 01:24:45.657]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:24:45.697 --> 01:24:48.799]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[01:24:48.959 --> 01:24:49.759]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:24:49.779 --> 01:24:51.280]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:51.440]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:51.761]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:25:05.153 --> 01:25:15.226]  We have had three previous video contests, and I'd say on average we get about 350 or more entries each time, so millions of views on YouTube.
[01:25:17.932 --> 01:25:21.854]  But we've only gotten, in the last couple weeks, a couple entries.
[01:25:22.615 --> 01:25:24.036]  We normally get a whole bunch early.
[01:25:24.116 --> 01:25:25.237]  It's kind of freaking me out.
[01:25:26.257 --> 01:25:27.258]  We got three prizes.
[01:25:27.278 --> 01:25:27.418]  $15,000 total.
[01:25:27.538 --> 01:25:27.918]  First prize, $100,000.
[01:25:27.958 --> 01:25:27.918]  $10,000.
[01:25:27.978 --> 01:25:28.358]  First prize, $10,000.
[01:25:28.399 --> 01:25:29.119]  Second prize, $3,000.
[01:25:29.279 --> 01:25:29.879]  Third prize, $2,000.
[01:25:29.919 --> 01:25:31.160]  Three different contests.
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:32.681]  You want a solution to this?
[01:25:40.546 --> 01:25:43.267]  This won't save the world, but it's another blow against the globalists.
[01:25:43.847 --> 01:25:53.169]  We want to see your creativity put out there in different ways to show people the naked body scanners are to be mandatory, they're going to be on the roads, they're going to be mobile.
[01:25:53.569 --> 01:26:01.651]  You can take it right off the news where they, with a straight face, show them at all the major airports grabbing women's breasts and they wrench around them in a circle.
[01:26:02.091 --> 01:26:05.912]  They go, and then they reach up and grab your testicles.
[01:26:06.012 --> 01:26:08.193]  I mean, I'm not, this is not happening to me.
[01:26:09.053 --> 01:26:11.114]  They put me over to the side for more screening.
[01:26:11.194 --> 01:26:12.035]  No, no, no!
[01:26:12.395 --> 01:26:14.116]  Keep your hands off that, pal!
[01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:16.338]  Okay?
[01:26:17.378 --> 01:26:19.900]  Women have to have permission and no man's ever touched that.
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:21.261]  I've never even had a medical exam.
[01:26:21.301 --> 01:26:23.482]  I guess in football, they did.
[01:26:23.842 --> 01:26:26.704]  They do that cough thing to see if you have a hernia.
[01:26:27.064 --> 01:26:27.885]  I guess that's not true.
[01:26:28.205 --> 01:26:31.467]  But you're not my football coach, and so you're not doing that.
[01:26:31.907 --> 01:26:32.648]  Do you understand?
[01:26:32.768 --> 01:26:34.389]  I mean, this is insane!
[01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:36.150]  This is insane!
[01:26:36.410 --> 01:26:40.514]  But if they can break your will and make you submit to that, they can be invasive.
[01:26:40.554 --> 01:26:44.598]  Bill Clinton signed an executive order to take blood samples to get a driver's license.
[01:26:44.638 --> 01:26:48.761]  Now they've got federal grants for warrantless checkpoints taking blood all over the country.
[01:26:50.002 --> 01:26:51.184]  This is serious business.
[01:26:51.224 --> 01:26:59.771]  I want to get into solutions for a few minutes and then get into the whole abortion issue in this country and how it ties into the government takeover of healthcare and some more phone calls.
[01:26:59.811 --> 01:27:00.212]  But listen.
[01:27:01.354 --> 01:27:04.697]  InfoWars has officially launched the Naked Body Scanner protest.
[01:27:05.418 --> 01:27:09.041]  And there's banners on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, rotating banners.
[01:27:09.381 --> 01:27:11.443]  If they're not there when you first go to the site, hit refresh.
[01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:22.811]  This is a $10,000 prize, and it can be a protest or a stunt that's legal, a demonstration, a video, whatever it is, it's got to be a video.
[01:27:23.131 --> 01:27:25.234]  Send it to contestinfowars.com.
[01:27:25.554 --> 01:27:26.575]  The field's wide open.
[01:27:26.635 --> 01:27:31.860]  Second prize, $3,000, is posting flyers against the naked body scanners.
[01:27:32.461 --> 01:27:36.802]  And the TSA, wherever it's legal and lawful, videotaping it and posting it on YouTube.
[01:27:37.042 --> 01:27:44.444]  Third prize going and finding stuff where I've predicted things that have happened from YouTube and Google, all those clubs, and putting a video together on that.
[01:27:44.484 --> 01:27:45.545]  That's $15,000.
[01:27:46.985 --> 01:27:50.446]  Google InfoWars officially launches Naked Body Scanner protest.
[01:27:50.886 --> 01:27:57.628]  It'll pull up the contest rules if you can't find the link on InfoWars, our prison planet, and get involved in this now.
[01:27:58.248 --> 01:28:00.749]  Now I'm sure we'll just get a whole bunch close to the end,
[01:28:02.125 --> 01:28:06.667]  Because we've had three other contests, and once, we didn't get too many entries, and then a bunch came in the last week.
[01:28:06.707 --> 01:28:08.608]  But this one, it's almost dead.
[01:28:09.489 --> 01:28:13.671]  And so, that's good for, I guess, those of you out there who don't want to be up against a bunch of competition.
[01:28:13.991 --> 01:28:17.753]  But everybody wins by making a video exposing these cretins.
[01:28:18.553 --> 01:28:18.853]  Okay.
[01:28:19.134 --> 01:28:24.556]  And this is becoming mandatory on the highways, to get into sports stadiums.
[01:28:25.257 --> 01:28:30.840]  We have the Homeland Security training videos, brain scanners, recording your naked body biometrically.
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:31.520]  It's incredible.
[01:28:32.745 --> 01:28:34.887]  Watson, you wanted to stay on, which is a rarity.
[01:28:34.927 --> 01:28:36.888]  Watson always wants to get off to something else he's working on.
[01:28:37.349 --> 01:28:38.510]  He's a real workhorse here.
[01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:41.692]  But, do you want to talk about your ideas for solutions?
[01:28:42.893 --> 01:28:43.394]  Well, yeah.
[01:28:43.554 --> 01:28:46.296]  The fact is, we're really getting some momentum on this.
[01:28:47.437 --> 01:28:54.543]  Because, historically, it's been proven that strip searches are illegal, even for criminals.
[01:28:55.043 --> 01:28:57.725]  And yet, we're being told our children are going to be subjected to it.
[01:28:59.656 --> 01:29:01.958]  Idaho trying to pass a law against it in their state.
[01:29:02.038 --> 01:29:03.679]  We've got congressmen speaking out.
[01:29:03.719 --> 01:29:07.362]  We've got airline executives saying it's killing air travel, which is exactly what the government wants.
[01:29:07.682 --> 01:29:08.523]  Implode the economy.
[01:29:09.283 --> 01:29:10.724]  This is very unpopular.
[01:29:10.764 --> 01:29:11.645]  This is bold, though.
[01:29:11.705 --> 01:29:15.007]  Why shouldn't the criminals in government try it to see if they can get away with it?
[01:29:15.027 --> 01:29:16.548]  If they don't try, they'll never succeed.
[01:29:16.868 --> 01:29:19.050]  We've got to try and have victory against them.
[01:29:20.331 --> 01:29:22.152]  Here's the big news that came out today.
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:37.486]  New York City, 33 million dollar settlement in a class action lawsuit that found the strip searches conducted in New York City jails over an eight year period from 99 to 2007.
[01:29:37.546 --> 01:29:45.130]  This is strip searches done on criminals, petty criminals nonetheless, but criminals.
[01:29:45.723 --> 01:29:55.812]  Those strip searches today have been found to be completely illegal, and New York City must pay $33 million to the victims in a class action lawsuit settlement.
[01:29:56.832 --> 01:29:57.973]  So that's the way to go.
[01:29:58.134 --> 01:30:04.799]  If people start filing lawsuits over this, because it's provably criminal, I did a brief research on this.
[01:30:04.859 --> 01:30:08.923]  And then the feds will just blow up another airplane, as they were caught trying to do on Christmas Day.
[01:30:08.943 --> 01:30:13.226]  For those that don't know, the FBI admits they were ordered to help him get on the plane, everything.
[01:30:14.347 --> 01:30:20.673]  This is all on record now, but it's been buried in a few major newspapers, but the Undersecretary of State admits all this.
[01:30:21.033 --> 01:30:22.775]  It's all fake, folks.
[01:30:23.195 --> 01:30:29.401]  The radical Muslims are funded by the CIA in every major case, unless it's a provocateur action.
[01:30:30.281 --> 01:30:31.042]  New York Post.
[01:30:31.062 --> 01:30:34.305]  Defense says New York Synagogue bomb plot was Fed's idea.
[01:30:34.525 --> 01:30:39.670]  They promised a guy dying of liver failure a liver if he would just talk about how he was planning it.
[01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:41.011]  It's totally staged.
[01:30:42.634 --> 01:30:46.635]  And the State Department ordered the underwear bomber to be on the plate.
[01:30:46.975 --> 01:30:48.816]  From top to bottom, that was staged.
[01:30:49.236 --> 01:31:00.818]  If you look at who owns the naked body scanner companies, there are some very interesting connections there in regards to how it was a well-dressed Indian man that helped him on the plate.
[01:31:01.279 --> 01:31:05.680]  The major body scanner manufacturer is owned by Indian billionaires.
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:07.300]  Just a coincidence, I'm sure.
[01:31:08.345 --> 01:31:12.086]  But there's that lawsuit, Class Action Settlement, today.
[01:31:12.326 --> 01:31:32.653]  There's also, as you mentioned, people need to lobby their local government to pass legislation like Idaho already has that make Homeland Security prove there's no health threat from the body scanners, which major global radiation bodies have, you know, openly stated that pregnant women shouldn't go through them.
[01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:38.803]  The risks are there, and they have to prove otherwise before they can go in the state at Idaho.
[01:31:39.203 --> 01:31:55.732]  Well, Lawson, you're going to continue to cover this, and you've got the key article about them grabbing women's breasts, and then videotaping it, body scanning it, and laughing about it, and how the government's saying, this is okay, this is good, our guys deserve to have some fun with your women and your children.
[01:31:56.352 --> 01:31:59.293]  Uh, and we don't care if it violates child porn laws in England and the U.S.
[01:31:59.333 --> 01:31:59.893]  We're the government.
[01:31:59.913 --> 01:32:00.474]  We're God.
[01:32:00.814 --> 01:32:02.374]  The Fed's trying to set the precedent.
[01:32:02.394 --> 01:32:07.516]  There is no rights for their federal police force to then be on the streets and do this to everyone.
[01:32:07.536 --> 01:32:09.277]  This was announced in Congress yesterday.
[01:32:09.317 --> 01:32:11.058]  We've told you for months this was coming.
[01:32:11.078 --> 01:32:12.638]  We also have the Homeland Security video.
[01:32:12.958 --> 01:32:14.439]  It's all at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:32:14.479 --> 01:32:15.419]  Thank you so much, Watson.
[01:32:15.759 --> 01:32:16.280]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:23.702]  Okay, uh, look, in the first, second, and third hour, I did nothing but take calls and cover the entire healthcare bill.
[01:32:24.783 --> 01:32:25.163]  I mean, it's...
[01:32:26.914 --> 01:32:31.298]  I almost don't want to cover anything but this, because the media keeps lying about what's really in it.
[01:32:31.399 --> 01:32:33.501]  It's worse than what the Republicans say.
[01:32:34.181 --> 01:32:35.923]  The IRS taxes your health care.
[01:32:36.203 --> 01:32:38.686]  The IRS taxes your savings accounts.
[01:32:38.926 --> 01:32:40.868]  The IRS controls your bank account.
[01:32:41.108 --> 01:32:44.832]  They're going to give you a medical ID and they're allowed to take money out whenever they want.
[01:32:44.852 --> 01:32:47.555]  I mean, this is so insane, but separately,
[01:32:49.264 --> 01:32:52.025]  They signed an executive order saying you can't have abortion funds.
[01:32:52.105 --> 01:32:55.787]  They're already doing abortion funds with federal grants to hospitals and clinics.
[01:32:56.847 --> 01:33:09.153]  As Ron Paul said on Fox two days ago, they even have a federal term for it, the federal money goes in and then they have money that they were going to spend on something else other than abortion at the hospital or clinic.
[01:33:10.117 --> 01:33:14.280]  They then move that money over to the abortion and pay for the other stuff with the federal money.
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:16.982]  It's nothing but a shell game.
[01:33:17.502 --> 01:33:18.603]  And it's all on record.
[01:33:18.883 --> 01:33:21.345]  And all the bishops and others have come out and exposed this.
[01:33:21.365 --> 01:33:25.027]  But I want to get into something that's been happening since Roe v. Wade, but it's now getting attention.
[01:33:25.087 --> 01:33:26.008]  It's so illegal.
[01:33:27.321 --> 01:33:30.664]  You've got to have a permission slip to go to the zoo when you're in school.
[01:33:31.304 --> 01:33:32.565]  Or to go to the planetarium.
[01:33:33.286 --> 01:33:36.948]  But not to have the school tell your child to have an abortion.
[01:33:37.489 --> 01:33:42.613]  They secretly say, don't tell your parents, we'll take you over to the clinic and give you an abortion.
[01:33:42.933 --> 01:33:44.334]  With the clinics they have in the schools.
[01:33:44.634 --> 01:33:47.777]  This is out of KOMO, Seattle, Washington.
[01:33:47.837 --> 01:33:49.498]  TV, it's also in the Seattle Times.
[01:33:49.838 --> 01:33:51.580]  Mother Furious after in-school clinic.
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.340]  Sets up teen abortion.
[01:33:53.661 --> 01:34:00.022]  The mother of Ballard High School student is fuming after the health center on campus helped facilitate her daughter's abortion during school hours.
[01:34:00.423 --> 01:34:06.444]  The mother, whom KOMO News has chosen to identify only as Jill, said the clinic kept the information confidential.
[01:34:06.804 --> 01:34:18.068]  When she signed a consent form, Jill figured it meant 15-year-old could go to the Ballard Teen Health Center located inside the high school for an air rake, a sports physician, or even birth control, but not for help
[01:34:19.028 --> 01:34:20.129]  Terminating a pregnancy.
[01:34:20.249 --> 01:34:23.473]  She took a pregnancy test at school, at the teen health center.
[01:34:23.833 --> 01:34:27.056]  Nowhere in the paperwork does it mention abortion or facilitating abortion.
[01:34:27.617 --> 01:34:29.118]  Well, you don't tell the scum parents.
[01:34:29.138 --> 01:34:33.643]  They're just to provide like eggs, like a hen to the state.
[01:34:35.124 --> 01:34:37.306]  Jill says her daughter, a pro-life advocate, was given a...
[01:34:38.157 --> 01:34:43.259]  Pass, put in a taxi and sent off to have an abortion during school hours, all without her family knowing.
[01:34:43.979 --> 01:34:46.520]  We had no idea this was being facilitated on campus, she said.
[01:34:46.921 --> 01:34:52.003]  They just told her that if she concealed it from her family, that it would be free of charge and no financial responsibility.
[01:34:52.183 --> 01:34:54.584]  So they work to keep it secret from your family.
[01:34:55.024 --> 01:34:57.425]  And this is standard procedure with these murdering scum.
[01:35:03.666 --> 01:35:04.446]  This is incredible.
[01:35:05.107 --> 01:35:07.428]  Folks, this is what this is really all about.
[01:35:08.188 --> 01:35:11.049]  And are people going to refuse to pay income taxes now?
[01:35:11.469 --> 01:35:12.590]  We built the country without them.
[01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:14.190]  When you're paying for abortion.
[01:35:16.071 --> 01:35:17.151]  Are you going to put up with this?
[01:35:17.412 --> 01:35:25.395]  I heard pro-lifers on local radio this morning arguing with the host that Travis County pays for abortions in schools with taxpayer money and doesn't tell the parents.
[01:35:25.415 --> 01:35:26.195]  That's on record!
[01:35:27.095 --> 01:35:28.116]  That passed last year!
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.884]  You pro-lifers are living in la-la land.
[01:35:32.904 --> 01:35:34.607]  You have no idea what's going on.
[01:35:35.008 --> 01:35:35.549]  Most of you.
[01:35:35.989 --> 01:35:42.440]  And I want to bring up a real pro-lifer who's been arrested on city property in Dallas on a sidewalk with many others.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.541]  He's gone to court over it.
[01:35:45.155 --> 01:35:52.398]  And I wanted to get Darrell Rundas, a pastor, I wanted to get his take on his view of Christians in this country.
[01:35:53.139 --> 01:35:55.880]  The government is criminal and has declared war on the people.
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:57.040]  It's totally lawless.
[01:35:57.381 --> 01:35:59.321]  The way this bill was passed was lawless.
[01:36:01.582 --> 01:36:03.003]  Darrell Rundas, good to have you on with us.
[01:36:03.383 --> 01:36:04.564]  Hey, great to be here, Alex.
[01:36:04.604 --> 01:36:05.204]  Thanks for having me.
[01:36:06.650 --> 01:36:09.652]  So give us your take on the story I just covered and the bill.
[01:36:10.052 --> 01:36:11.453]  Well, I tell you, you're absolutely right.
[01:36:11.473 --> 01:36:25.321]  In fact, there's a new movie coming out called Blood Money, and it's all about what you just talked about, government-funded abortions, and how it may be illegal to give your kid an aspirin at a public school, but they can go and get them an abortion without your permission.
[01:36:25.401 --> 01:36:25.902]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:36:28.303 --> 01:36:28.783]  Continue.
[01:36:30.014 --> 01:36:36.799]  The bottom line is, Alex, and I heard you talk about earlier today, that we all just need to get on our knees and repent, and that truly is the case.
[01:36:36.839 --> 01:36:47.968]  In fact, I was just reading this morning in 2 Thessalonians, where the Bible clearly says, "...let no one deceive you by any means, for that day won't come until the great falling away comes."
[01:36:48.028 --> 01:36:52.311]  And he's talking in reference to the Antichrist and the One World Government and so on.
[01:36:52.372 --> 01:36:59.197]  And, you know, that's why we see so much apathy, so much pathetic behavior among those who call themselves Christians.
[01:36:59.617 --> 01:37:01.158]  It's part of the great falling away.
[01:37:01.178 --> 01:37:06.562]  It's part of that great cup of delusion that God has poured out upon the people who won't...
[01:37:30.038 --> 01:37:33.000]  In every culture, the government always seeks to kill kids.
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:34.742]  They're going to turn everything on its head.
[01:37:34.782 --> 01:37:36.143]  That's exactly what we see.
[01:37:36.203 --> 01:37:39.426]  We see a government that's not of, by, and for the people.
[01:37:39.486 --> 01:37:45.251]  It's not, you know, a country that's the home of the free and, you know, or land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:37:45.271 --> 01:37:46.892]  It's more land of the slave.
[01:37:47.532 --> 01:37:50.375]  And people are living in an invisible prison.
[01:37:50.835 --> 01:37:53.297]  We have had the wool pulled over our eyes incrementally.
[01:37:53.317 --> 01:37:54.679]  They continually increase.
[01:37:54.739 --> 01:37:55.079]  In fact,
[01:37:55.732 --> 01:38:05.866]  As our forefathers stated in the Declaration of Independence, until such time as the long train of abuse has become intolerable, people will tolerate it.
[01:38:05.946 --> 01:38:10.252]  They will continue to put up with it, and I believe, and that's why I'm almost happy
[01:38:10.799 --> 01:38:16.041]  That they were so arrogant in passing this healthcare bill because I think it was the great wake-up call.
[01:38:16.101 --> 01:38:17.541]  It certainly was for me.
[01:38:17.561 --> 01:38:22.162]  Let me just share something kind of private with you and make it public for everybody.
[01:38:22.202 --> 01:38:28.544]  But, man, I've had you and many other celebrities and TV people say, Darryl, you need to start a radio show.
[01:38:28.564 --> 01:38:29.605]  You gotta start a radio show.
[01:38:29.645 --> 01:38:30.625]  You gotta start a radio show.
[01:38:31.218 --> 01:38:40.364]  And honestly, Alex, I continue to put it off because, man, I've worked 20 years, 120 hours a week building a big company so I could sell it.
[01:38:40.544 --> 01:38:46.848]  And you've started national Christian television shows and have a huge bio.
[01:38:46.988 --> 01:38:51.331]  And I know what that commitment is because I have had that experience.
[01:38:51.411 --> 01:38:52.892]  I know the kind of time you're putting in.
[01:38:53.032 --> 01:38:54.653]  I know the kind of sacrifice you're making.
[01:38:54.713 --> 01:38:55.474]  I know the kind of
[01:38:55.694 --> 01:38:57.295]  We're good to go.
[01:39:17.034 --> 01:39:20.937]  Take the National ID Act in this healthcare bill.
[01:39:20.957 --> 01:39:28.122]  The simple fact of the matter is, you now are mandated to have healthcare, but you can't get healthcare until you take the National ID Act.
[01:39:28.142 --> 01:39:32.945]  So that means, if you don't want a National ID card with an RFID chip to track you wherever you go,
[01:39:33.585 --> 01:39:45.099]  And so the reason I wanted to have you on today is because I've told you, Daryl, to start a radio show and you've said, no, I want to support you and you've donated and really helped us.
[01:39:45.499 --> 01:39:50.385]  No, we need more voices, more people, more prominent, well-spoken, successful.
[01:39:51.443 --> 01:39:55.904]  Salesmen like yourself and others to go out and sell freedom and the truth.
[01:39:55.964 --> 01:39:59.905]  We need more people attacking the New World Order from every angle.
[01:40:00.506 --> 01:40:02.826]  And let me just show people this so they understand.
[01:40:03.546 --> 01:40:03.766]  U.S.
[01:40:03.806 --> 01:40:06.127]  citizens may need national ID card for work.
[01:40:06.267 --> 01:40:07.728]  That's now in the amnesty bill.
[01:40:08.228 --> 01:40:09.168]  But in this bill,
[01:40:10.638 --> 01:40:10.958]  Of course.
[01:40:10.978 --> 01:40:11.959]  Isn't that standard?
[01:40:33.052 --> 01:40:34.392]  You know, what should we expect?
[01:40:34.732 --> 01:40:35.793]  Especially as Christians.
[01:40:35.873 --> 01:40:39.214]  And one reason I am a Christian is because I know the Bible's true.
[01:40:39.274 --> 01:40:39.874]  It's accurate.
[01:40:39.934 --> 01:40:40.574]  I've studied it.
[01:40:40.634 --> 01:40:41.574]  I've scrutinized it.
[01:40:41.774 --> 01:40:49.296]  We now have a one-world government forming that wants to track everything we eat, everything we do, and taxes, and make us show a mark to buy and sell.
[01:40:49.416 --> 01:40:49.736]  That's it.
[01:40:49.796 --> 01:40:51.517]  And we're one step away now.
[01:40:51.697 --> 01:40:55.258]  With this national ID Act, we are one step away from having to take a mark.
[01:40:55.278 --> 01:40:56.418]  Because you know what the ultimate
[01:40:56.758 --> 01:40:57.158]  I think so.
[01:41:15.667 --> 01:41:16.488]  You know, are accurate.
[01:41:16.508 --> 01:41:18.330]  They're true, and they're happening by design.
[01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:19.591]  They're happening for a reason.
[01:41:19.912 --> 01:41:22.975]  And they were foretold thousands of years ago by the prophets of God.
[01:41:23.015 --> 01:41:27.299]  And the bottom line is, 2 Chronicles 7.14 sums it up best.
[01:41:27.439 --> 01:41:28.841]  You alluded to it earlier today.
[01:41:29.381 --> 01:41:36.709]  If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray, and here's the key caveat, and turn from their wicked ways.
[01:41:37.029 --> 01:41:38.550]  That means no more football games.
[01:41:38.831 --> 01:41:43.474]  That means no more idolatry, American Idol, ooh I can't wait to see who's on TV tonight.
[01:41:43.734 --> 01:41:48.478]  No, it's about getting up, wising up, waking up, and speaking up, and never shutting up or giving up.
[01:41:48.938 --> 01:41:50.680]  Well Darryl, I agree with you.
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:58.646]  It's time to fully commit and realize this is life and death against this evil, and the fake churches will say, oh no, we're about to all be raptured, stand down.
[01:41:58.986 --> 01:41:59.787]  That doesn't matter.
[01:42:00.347 --> 01:42:01.147]  Duty is ours.
[01:42:01.227 --> 01:42:02.528]  Consequence belongs to God.
[01:42:02.548 --> 01:42:10.531]  I know there's all those verses in the Bible for Christians out there where God says, if you don't stand up against the evil, then the blood of the innocent will be on your hands.
[01:42:10.591 --> 01:42:12.312]  You are all accomplices.
[01:42:12.332 --> 01:42:13.773]  And I'm talking to Christians out there.
[01:42:15.202 --> 01:42:19.084]  That scripture says it's my people, my people who are called by my name.
[01:42:19.365 --> 01:42:22.447]  He's not giving that rebuke and that instruction to the lost people.
[01:42:22.687 --> 01:42:24.948]  Hey, people that are in the world act like people in the world.
[01:42:25.068 --> 01:42:27.350]  I expect politicians to act the way they're acting.
[01:42:27.630 --> 01:42:35.015]  What I don't expect is for people who say they love God, who love Him so much He died for them, to not be willing to also lay down their lives for Christ.
[01:42:35.035 --> 01:42:40.678]  Well, what's the number one thing, you asked me this yesterday, what's the number one thing in surveys people respond to when they hear the word Christian?
[01:42:40.778 --> 01:42:41.519]  It's hypocrite.
[01:42:42.279 --> 01:42:45.140]  And that's because people aren't really Christians, folks.
[01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:53.423]  If you aren't fighting tyranny and don't have a burning desire to stand against corruption for the innocents, then you are not a Christian.
[01:42:54.304 --> 01:42:59.125]  You're alive one time on this planet, hurtling through space, and you're going to hell if you don't fight this evil.
[01:42:59.145 --> 01:43:04.848]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[01:43:04.928 --> 01:43:08.629]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites?
[01:43:08.849 --> 01:43:09.970]  Parasitic Infection?
[01:43:10.150 --> 01:43:12.812]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[01:43:13.012 --> 01:43:18.817]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.
[01:43:18.997 --> 01:43:27.824]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely.
[01:43:28.144 --> 01:43:35.648]  FPP, or fossilized phytoplankton powder, has been used worldwide for thousands of uses and is now available from Freshwater Organics.

[01:43:48.814 --> 01:43:51.296]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:43:51.336 --> 01:43:53.498]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:43:53.578 --> 01:43:57.141]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:43:57.241 --> 01:44:02.125]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[01:44:16.852 --> 01:44:18.552]  And they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:18.712 --> 01:44:24.274]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:24.294 --> 01:44:27.034]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:44:27.195 --> 01:44:33.936]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:34.036 --> 01:44:36.157]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:36.377 --> 01:44:37.717]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:37.977 --> 01:44:40.298]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:40.418 --> 01:44:42.258]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:42.558 --> 01:44:45.279]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[01:44:46.059 --> 01:44:46.899]  Afraid to answer it?
[01:44:46.979 --> 01:44:48.340]  Afraid to answer your door?
[01:45:08.919 --> 01:45:09.259]  We're good.

[01:46:02.256 --> 01:46:10.321]  All right, here is Representative Daniel on talk radio yesterday saying we've got to control the people.
[01:46:10.861 --> 01:46:12.082]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[01:46:12.462 --> 01:46:17.585]  We're not ready to be doing it, but let me remind you, this has been going on for years.
[01:46:18.225 --> 01:46:19.566]  We are bringing it to a halt.
[01:46:20.066 --> 01:46:30.292]  The harsh fact of the matter is when you're going to pass legislation that will cover 300 American people in different ways, it takes a long time
[01:46:30.936 --> 01:46:32.617]  Well, all I can say, Alex, is
[01:46:58.706 --> 01:47:09.012]  I would ask everybody listening, believer or non-believer, to question my motive on why I would get off the sidelines and into the battle when I had everything the world had to offer.
[01:47:09.052 --> 01:47:10.713]  I could go anywhere, do anything, have everything.
[01:47:10.973 --> 01:47:13.395]  Could retire, work really hard to put myself in that position.
[01:47:13.415 --> 01:47:14.595]  I'm not boasting, I'm not bragging.
[01:47:14.956 --> 01:47:17.177]  God bless me, but the point of the matter is simply this.
[01:47:17.657 --> 01:47:23.040]  With this new healthcare bill, it's so increasingly obvious you cannot escape the tyranny.
[01:47:23.441 --> 01:47:27.143]  I believe it was Patrick Henry, it might have been Daniel Adams, that said,
[01:47:27.737 --> 01:47:28.918]  Well, here's an example.
[01:47:28.938 --> 01:47:31.781]  Let's say there's well-spoken doctors listening, or lawyers.
[01:47:31.861 --> 01:47:35.705]  They need to go buy time on local stations to a Sunday or Saturday show.
[01:47:35.725 --> 01:47:36.405]  Start a website.
[01:47:36.425 --> 01:47:37.326]  Start a newsletter.
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:50.921]  Start calling into talk radio.
[01:47:50.961 --> 01:47:51.941]  Go to city council.
[01:47:52.261 --> 01:47:55.482]  Talk about, you know, just... Everybody has to have their voice be heard.
[01:47:55.642 --> 01:48:01.184]  Even if you don't have the means as me or you or other people to maybe get up and go do that, there's so many different things you can do.
[01:48:01.304 --> 01:48:02.325]  Look, here's a simple one.
[01:48:02.365 --> 01:48:03.165]  You hate junk mail.
[01:48:03.185 --> 01:48:04.045]  You hate getting junk mail.
[01:48:04.085 --> 01:48:11.348]  Well, when they send you those business reply mails, just stick some literature in there about the New World Order, about the Obama deception, about InfoWars, and send it back to them.
[01:48:11.768 --> 01:48:15.490]  Well, people are now putting InTheFed or InfoWars.com on their money.
[01:48:15.550 --> 01:48:16.390]  I'm seeing it everywhere.
[01:48:16.690 --> 01:48:17.410]  Well, that's what I meant.
[01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:20.871]  You know, hey, if somebody's going to send me junk mail to my house, then you know what?
[01:48:20.931 --> 01:48:24.812]  I'm going to send them back some gospel information about the Bible, about Jesus.
[01:48:24.872 --> 01:48:25.532]  I mean, it's free.
[01:48:25.932 --> 01:48:28.393]  You know, but look how fast they'll take you off the junk mail list, too.
[01:48:28.413 --> 01:48:31.913]  But look, there's a thousand different things you could be doing.
[01:48:32.354 --> 01:48:38.575]  Whatever your gifting is, whatever your calling is, get up, get out, get busy doing something, because now is the time to take a
[01:48:38.955 --> 01:48:43.639]  Well the number one thing is go to your state houses and say nullify this federal act.
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:45.701]  Don't just have your Attorney General sue.
[01:48:46.282 --> 01:48:48.403]  Pass legislation saying not in our state.
[01:48:48.704 --> 01:48:49.885]  That's constitutional.
[01:48:50.225 --> 01:48:56.890]  It's time for the states to stand up to the federal government that is totally reprobate and criminal.
[01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:57.771]  I mean look at these articles.
[01:48:58.091 --> 01:48:59.753]  Should government regulate what we eat?
[01:49:00.233 --> 01:49:02.015]  The feds want to ban trans fats.
[01:49:02.415 --> 01:49:02.755]  Salt.
[01:49:03.696 --> 01:49:11.078]  Uh, nanny state, banning mowing yards for cash, banning swap meets, banning garage sales.
[01:49:11.138 --> 01:49:13.318]  Oh, you can't even go fishing in your own pond anymore.
[01:49:13.358 --> 01:49:13.738]  Come on.
[01:49:14.059 --> 01:49:14.479]  That's right.
[01:49:14.499 --> 01:49:22.221]  The feds have introduced regulations to ban and make you get a federal license to fish in your own pond, to ban drilling your own well.
[01:49:22.501 --> 01:49:23.661]  I mean, this is bondage.
[01:49:24.864 --> 01:49:27.025]  Even a fourth grader could understand this, okay?
[01:49:27.385 --> 01:49:37.787]  I've never met a person of decent moral character, Christian or non-Christian, religious or non-religious, who wouldn't say it's wrong to lie, or wrong to steal, wrong to kill, wrong to commit adultery, okay?
[01:49:37.827 --> 01:49:39.607]  And the bottom line is these guys are raping us.
[01:49:39.667 --> 01:49:40.548]  They're pillaging us.
[01:49:40.828 --> 01:49:46.509]  They're taking anything and everything you've ever worked for and turning it into a complete police state and a control state.
[01:49:46.549 --> 01:49:50.110]  If you don't believe it, okay, you don't take my word for it, don't take Alex's word for it.
[01:49:50.130 --> 01:49:51.350]  And they're pillaging us!
[01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:52.711]  So let me finish this point, Alex.
[01:49:52.791 --> 01:49:54.331]  Don't even take Alex's word for it.
[01:49:54.751 --> 01:49:55.512]  Well, Darryl, we're out of time.
[01:50:09.022 --> 01:50:11.343]  The broadcast is over, but I'll talk to you when we go off air.
[01:50:11.363 --> 01:50:14.563]  We'll have you back soon when you get ready to launch your radio slash TV show.
[01:50:14.943 --> 01:50:16.444]  Everybody else, now is the time.
[01:50:16.504 --> 01:50:17.444]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:50:17.764 --> 01:50:19.305]  Don't screw around anymore.
[01:50:19.445 --> 01:50:20.045]  It's over.
[01:50:20.705 --> 01:50:23.246]  It's time to take our country back from the criminals.
[01:50:23.286 --> 01:50:24.286]  They've all moved in.
[01:50:24.606 --> 01:50:27.067]  They're looting and raping and pillaging everything.
[01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:30.867]  They're staging the terror attacks and the fake environmental takeovers.
[01:50:31.108 --> 01:50:32.908]  They're coming with amnesty, everything else.
[01:50:33.268 --> 01:50:35.689]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:35.749 --> 01:50:36.489]  Great job, crew.
[01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:42.310]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:43.851 --> 01:50:46.011]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:48.672 --> 01:50:49.952]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:49.972 --> 01:50:55.313]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:50:55.553 --> 01:51:00.194]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:00.574 --> 01:51:02.975]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before.
