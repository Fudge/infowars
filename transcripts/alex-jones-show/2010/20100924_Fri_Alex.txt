[00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:05.215]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.856 --> 00:00:06.897]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.638 --> 00:00:08.779]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:10.220]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:11.882]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:16.247]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.728 --> 00:00:20.812]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.744]  We've got an important broadcast lined up for you on this Friday transmission.
[00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:32.168]  It is the 24th day of September 2010.
[00:00:32.808 --> 00:00:37.093]  Bob Chapman with his once-a-week visit on the economy and so much more will be with us the third hour.
[00:00:37.113 --> 00:00:45.622]  We have Daryl Metcalfe, a state representative who was listed along with his Second Amendment group as potential terrorist.
[00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:50.179]  The Pittsburgh Tribune Review has been writing on this.
[00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.941]  We've had our own detailed reports before this was even in the mainstream news.
[00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:56.843]  Pennsylvania Homeland Security targeted tea parties.
[00:00:57.283 --> 00:01:00.485]  Second Amendment group made terror threat list in Pennsylvania.
[00:01:01.326 --> 00:01:03.087]  That is all coming up.
[00:01:03.187 --> 00:01:11.371]  Because remember, the 9-11 attacks, whether you think it's an inside job or you really think men in a cave, made NORAD stand down and blew up Building 7.
[00:01:12.987 --> 00:01:14.368]  Along with the Easter Bunny's help.
[00:01:14.848 --> 00:01:25.595]  Even if you believe that fable, you cannot deny they've used the 9-11 attacks to set up homeland security for gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, returning veterans.
[00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:26.416]  Okay?
[00:01:26.656 --> 00:01:27.096]  Period.
[00:01:27.557 --> 00:01:28.077]  Period.
[00:01:28.377 --> 00:01:29.678]  You cannot debate that.
[00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:36.442]  The people at Red State and everywhere else, living in denial about this, need to wake up and understand this.
[00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:54.293]  I've got all this incredible news, and I'm going to shoot a special video today that'll be up Sunday or Monday, and I've had brainstorm after brainstorm the last two days, have written page after page of notes, and I'm not going to do it live here on air until Monday, but I'm going to put a video out on it this weekend.
[00:01:55.871 --> 00:01:58.272]  I've really had to do some soul-searching about Glenn Beck.
[00:01:58.332 --> 00:02:00.013]  I mean, Glenn Beck is a phenomenon.
[00:02:00.394 --> 00:02:02.595]  Tens of millions of listeners, millions of viewers.
[00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:10.139]  And I've seen him do a lot of bad things, like supporting the Patriot Act, supporting the Banker Bailout, demonizing Ron Paul.
[00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:21.045]  But saying that I was going to make a film about the neocons trying to come back into power, which we are still going to make, we've been doing something I've never done before.
[00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:27.263]  I mean, I'll be honest with you folks, I really never watched Glenn Beck.
[00:02:27.303 --> 00:02:32.227]  I would see YouTube boildowns of things he was doing that were terrible, and I would criticize him for it.
[00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:39.733]  But in the last few months, I've had crew and myself, they watch it every day, I don't have time, and they show me selects.
[00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.035]  This is unprecedented.
[00:02:42.075 --> 00:02:45.198]  His show Wednesday on Fox TV and Thursday
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.261]  Nothing this truthful has ever been put out on national television.
[00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:52.662]  I mean, I'll just say that right now.
[00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:54.483]  I mean, see, it's like Michael Savage.
[00:02:55.143 --> 00:03:00.366]  I give him credit for coming out the last year and saying Obama will probably stage terror attacks in America.
[00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:02.267]  We can play those clips.
[00:03:02.287 --> 00:03:03.347]  You can just search him if you want.
[00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:04.327]  We've written articles about it.
[00:03:05.288 --> 00:03:07.509]  I disagree with Savage on, you know, some issues.
[00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:08.509]  I agree with him on most.
[00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.892]  The point is, when somebody has that type of courage, you've got to give him credit and
[00:03:15.882 --> 00:03:18.963]  We've engaged in a deep analysis of what Glenn Beck is doing.
[00:03:20.444 --> 00:03:31.987]  And I have to say that if he continues on the trend, getting more hardcore every week, and we've been monitoring his radio as well, he will be Alex Jones hardcore within one year.
[00:03:33.428 --> 00:03:38.870]  And then I'll, I mean, if that ever happened, I'll never completely trust him like I do Ron Paul.
[00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.851]  Ron Paul was the same 30 years ago, 10 years ago, a year ago this week.
[00:03:43.491 --> 00:03:44.952]  A real patriot across the board.
[00:03:46.717 --> 00:03:50.480]  Exposing the world government, the New World Order, the Fabian Socialists, the bankers.
[00:03:52.281 --> 00:03:54.303]  I can never completely trust Glenn Beck.
[00:03:57.746 --> 00:04:01.869]  I can never completely trust him because I've seen so much doublespeak and treachery in the past.
[00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.373]  But I understand why a lot of our listeners and viewers are like, why are you saying he's bad, Alex?
[00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:07.334]  Aren't you watching?
[00:04:07.374 --> 00:04:08.294]  Well, no, I really wasn't.
[00:04:14.301 --> 00:04:14.901]  It's incredible.
[00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:16.221]  I mean, that's all I can say.
[00:04:16.341 --> 00:04:19.302]  And the biggest issue and message here is this.
[00:04:20.082 --> 00:04:31.325]  The fact that the things we talk about are now mainstream television shows how far, as a society, we've come.
[00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:39.907]  And you notice that Roger Ailes is still in at Fox, record ratings, and Zuckerman at NBC is gone, Jonathan Klein leaving CNN.
[00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:40.807]  They're falling apart.
[00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:50.203]  I mean, yesterday, Beck was talking about stuff we wrote about two years ago, dealing with the federal government admitting they're setting up world government.
[00:04:51.964 --> 00:04:53.425]  Alright, I'm not getting into it today.
[00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:54.385]  I may a little bit later.
[00:04:54.786 --> 00:04:55.606]  It was just amazing.
[00:04:56.406 --> 00:04:58.307]  But big announcements over the weekend and next week.
[00:04:58.327 --> 00:04:59.528]  I'll give you my full view on it.
[00:04:59.548 --> 00:05:03.530]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning TrendsResearch.com.

[00:05:56.604 --> 00:05:58.326]  This information is too important to wait.
[00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.471]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:04.811 --> 00:06:08.534]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:08.674 --> 00:06:10.956]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:10.976 --> 00:06:16.420]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:23.085]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:23.505 --> 00:06:29.050]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.153]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:33.653 --> 00:06:37.677]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:37.957 --> 00:06:43.461]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:43.902 --> 00:06:46.884]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:47.465 --> 00:06:48.866]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:49.426 --> 00:06:49.867]  It's here.

[00:07:09.892 --> 00:07:16.977]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:07:17.278 --> 00:07:21.861]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:08:07.758 --> 00:08:13.999]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:17.253 --> 00:08:20.454]  Okay, my friends, we are back live here.
[00:08:20.574 --> 00:08:26.277]  It is Friday, the 24th day of September 2010.
[00:08:26.877 --> 00:08:31.599]  I'll be back this Sunday with the abbreviated transmission from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:32.239 --> 00:08:33.900]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:41.243]  All right, let me just run through some of the news that we have here in front of us today.
[00:08:42.418 --> 00:08:46.239]  On the economy, gold climbs to $1,300 an ounce.
[00:08:47.179 --> 00:08:49.640]  On dollar concern, gold futures are even higher.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.001]  Silver at 30-year high, surging as well.
[00:08:55.101 --> 00:09:09.985]  The bad news, Congress puts the vote on taxes off until after the election, meaning the entire Bush tax cuts for the middle class, for poor people, for rich people, it will go into effect.
[00:09:11.428 --> 00:09:17.929]  Headline, Congress punts on taxes, Democrats put off showdown on Bush cuts until after November election.
[00:09:19.209 --> 00:09:19.890]  Here's another one.
[00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.370]  What more Fed easing means for markets?
[00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.371]  America on sale.
[00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:34.052]  And it goes on to admit that it means as the dollars devalued, foreigners can come in and buy up our assets that much cheaper.
[00:09:35.272 --> 00:09:37.993]  It's a widespread business or corporate level
[00:09:39.684 --> 00:09:40.545]  I don't know.
[00:09:56.141 --> 00:09:56.381]  I think?
[00:10:15.353 --> 00:10:18.434]  That we need to get over our anger dealing with tax increases.
[00:10:18.774 --> 00:10:24.815]  Yeah, you gotta love the fact that Warren Buffett's companies got tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer banker bailout money.
[00:10:25.775 --> 00:10:35.637]  But his response to people that don't want to pay taxes to these criminal banks that sold all these derivatives is that we need to get over our anger.
[00:10:35.697 --> 00:10:37.778]  Buffett to taxpayers, get over your anger.
[00:10:37.818 --> 00:10:38.918]  That's from Omaha.com.
[00:10:42.739 --> 00:10:48.002]  That is just some of the news on the economy that we're going to be going over today.
[00:10:48.042 --> 00:10:52.424]  Another report here, forget a recession, the empire is crumbling.
[00:10:53.845 --> 00:11:06.051]  In some other interesting news, Glenn Beck, yesterday on Fox, and we're glad to see this happening, we've put out public messages to Beck saying, please stop denying that the government wants to put Americans in FEMA camps.
[00:11:06.731 --> 00:11:11.174]  He talked about how the government has put Americans in camps before and said it was a danger last night.
[00:11:12.442 --> 00:11:16.103]  He talked about world population reduction and how that's the world government's plan.
[00:11:16.123 --> 00:11:24.165]  That he's going to expose it all week long next week and talk about how eugenics was created in the United States and exported to Nazi Germany.
[00:11:24.185 --> 00:11:25.306]  It's not exactly right.
[00:11:25.326 --> 00:11:29.127]  It was started in England, expanded here, then sold to the Germans.
[00:11:30.667 --> 00:11:43.679]  And he went over this report, Global Trends 2025, that we wrote no fewer than seven articles on two years ago, where the Pentagon and the National Intelligence Council admits we're going into a planetary government.
[00:11:45.373 --> 00:11:49.454]  And Beck got up and said, look, this isn't a conspiracy theory.
[00:11:49.795 --> 00:11:50.715]  This is a fact.
[00:11:51.015 --> 00:11:52.956]  The government is saying this themselves.
[00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:57.557]  But then Cass Sunstein comes out and says, you should be arrested if you talk about this.
[00:11:57.857 --> 00:12:02.539]  And he actually read Cass Sunstein quotes and said Cass Sunstein is a very dangerous man.
[00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:04.479]  In fact, the most dangerous in America.
[00:12:04.499 --> 00:12:05.200]  I don't agree with that.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.760]  He's got bosses.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.921]  But I'm just dumbfounded by what I'm seeing.
[00:12:10.461 --> 00:12:14.323]  But it shows why Fox has got top ratings and is growing.
[00:12:15.683 --> 00:12:21.047]  While, uh, both the NBC head and the CNN heads have quit today.
[00:12:21.467 --> 00:12:22.288]  Been fired, basically.
[00:12:22.308 --> 00:12:22.828]  Been run out.
[00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:33.877]  Because they'll have one other Bilderberg host on there, uh, telling you that there is no Bilderberg group, and then the next day, telling you how great the Bilderberg group is.
[00:12:34.946 --> 00:12:36.748]  And so all of this stuff's out in the open.
[00:12:36.808 --> 00:12:45.436]  And so if the dinosaur media continues to lie about this and call people conspiracy theorists, they're going to lose what credibility they've got left, which isn't much.
[00:12:47.395 --> 00:12:59.785]  So Fox is very smart to take on some of the Patriot Movement's political spots or colors to camouflage themselves.
[00:13:00.165 --> 00:13:01.066]  But this could be bigger.
[00:13:01.106 --> 00:13:03.387]  This could be an internal fight between the elite.
[00:13:03.668 --> 00:13:08.631]  There's a lot of nouveau riche, a lot of new wealth, a lot of new billionaires who are upset about what's going on.
[00:13:08.671 --> 00:13:10.153]  I've talked to some of them off record.
[00:13:10.613 --> 00:13:12.514]  A lot of the big monies leaving the U.S.
[00:13:12.975 --> 00:13:15.216]  realizes that this tyranny is so hardcore.
[00:13:15.437 --> 00:13:16.517]  They didn't mind tyranny.
[00:13:17.515 --> 00:13:32.364]  and and and corporate welfare to get filthy rich but now they realize this is a vertical integration and that they are open season as well so this could be a complete paradigm shift within the establishment realizing that uh... they can't beat us the patriots join us
[00:13:33.575 --> 00:13:35.516]  Again, I'm going to make a video about this today.
[00:13:35.537 --> 00:13:36.717]  It's going to be out this weekend.
[00:13:37.098 --> 00:13:40.821]  I'm going to make a big announcement next week concerning my view on all this.
[00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:42.982]  I'm really, quite frankly, still cogitating on it.
[00:13:43.743 --> 00:13:58.094]  But in the last two months, since I decided to make a film about the neocons and the liberals and how the whole left-right paradigm works and looking at the co-opting of the Tea Parties, that I've really immersed myself in studying Glenn Beck.
[00:13:58.774 --> 00:14:03.038]  And that means not just watching boildowns on YouTube of him, but actually watching him.
[00:14:03.818 --> 00:14:07.019]  And he's getting more hardcore every day.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:14.022]  And at current rates, in less than a year really, he will be as hardcore as Alex Jones if this continues.
[00:14:14.262 --> 00:14:14.562]  Fine!
[00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:16.823]  If that happens, I'll say, hey, he's great like Ron Paul.
[00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:27.508]  He should come out and say, I was wrong when I was for the Patriot Act, I was wrong when I was for the banker bailouts, I was wrong when I said there wasn't a New World Order, I was wrong when I made fun of people.
[00:14:28.188 --> 00:14:30.049]  And then we could even trust him, perhaps.
[00:14:31.897 --> 00:14:33.718]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.563]  But I'm going to make a whole video, a 15-minute press video release on the subject today.
[00:14:42.103 --> 00:14:42.864]  We'll shoot it today.
[00:14:42.884 --> 00:14:44.585]  Aaron will add documentation to it.
[00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:55.671]  Again, I don't trust these people as far as I can throw them, but the issue is they're coming out with hardcore truth.
[00:14:55.931 --> 00:14:57.052]  There's a global government.
[00:14:57.292 --> 00:14:58.393]  It wants to kill you.
[00:14:59.346 --> 00:15:05.753]  And then he's reading Cass Sunstein public quotes about, we need to make conspiracy theories illegal or tax them.
[00:15:06.254 --> 00:15:11.880]  We know that most of the conspiracy theories are true, but even if they are true, we still say they're lies.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.864]  I mean, and then Beck says, don't believe me, check it out for yourself.
[00:15:16.525 --> 00:15:19.669]  And then he goes on to
[00:15:23.186 --> 00:15:26.309]  Talk about how we're rats in a rat maze with controlled choices.
[00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:33.316]  Ladies and gentlemen, most of what you hear me talk about are epiphanies, understandings, connections I've made.
[00:15:33.396 --> 00:15:37.100]  I've coined hundreds of terms now in popular use.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.743]  Left-right paradigm, propaganda placement.
[00:15:42.486 --> 00:15:54.735]  And he literally, I kept wondering why Newsweek, Time, New York Times, Salon, hundreds of publications in the last year and a half kept saying Glenn Beck is riffing off of Alex Jones.
[00:15:55.095 --> 00:15:56.876]  Glenn Beck is copying Alex Jones.
[00:15:57.437 --> 00:16:09.005]  And even though I've got Nightline doing pieces on us, and even though I have higher internet ratings than Beck and Limbaugh combined, you can go look those up at the Google Trends, or you can go look that up at Alexa, or, you know, any of the major sites,
[00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:11.931]  I still think of myself as little.
[00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.692]  I still think, because, I mean, it's my little office.
[00:16:14.152 --> 00:16:15.873]  I literally carry the trash out many days.
[00:16:15.893 --> 00:16:18.335]  I mean, we're a small operation.
[00:16:20.096 --> 00:16:25.559]  And so I thought, oh, the media is trying to demonize Beck by, you know, saying I'm more of an extremist.
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.402]  And so they're claiming he's copying me.
[00:16:30.302 --> 00:16:31.243]  No, he really is.
[00:16:31.723 --> 00:16:38.127]  And, you know, at the end of the day, I don't really mind that.
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:58.972]  If Glenn Beck was for real, if he didn't take my message and then mix into it pro-war, pro-torture, Jack Bauer's a hero, you know, we need to take the gloves off, Ron Paul supporters might be violent, global warming might be real, on and on and on.
[00:17:01.093 --> 00:17:01.833]  I don't mind.
[00:17:01.913 --> 00:17:06.276]  I mean, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.
[00:17:09.721 --> 00:17:14.604]  But it also kind of shakes me up to hear him word for word.
[00:17:14.644 --> 00:17:16.725]  Now remember, he's got a $15 million studio.
[00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:17.445]  We've got a $100,000 studio.
[00:17:18.026 --> 00:17:18.326]  He's got
[00:17:24.031 --> 00:17:27.092]  A bunch of writers that ghostwrite his books and fill his teleprompters.
[00:17:27.392 --> 00:17:30.353]  You know, people always see Obama reading teleprompters and they're shocked.
[00:17:30.373 --> 00:17:32.074]  Well, where are the images of Beck?
[00:17:32.094 --> 00:17:33.374]  I mean, he's reading off teleprompters.
[00:17:33.715 --> 00:17:43.118]  So, it's whoever's doing his writing at Fox News, and I actually have this from two high-level people that work at Fox, and I was told this over a year ago and couldn't hardly believe it, separately.
[00:17:45.299 --> 00:17:51.241]  And then I was told by another radio executive who knows Beck and knows his bodyguards, who are retired FBI agents,
[00:17:52.452 --> 00:18:01.135]  That Beck believes in the New World Order, is freaked out, is building a bunker, is scared, and watches my show, listens to it daily.
[00:18:01.615 --> 00:18:13.478]  So I want to say to Glenn Beck, I challenged you a few years ago when you were saying FEMA camps didn't exist, when we sent you all the evidence of it, I challenged you to not continue with what you were doing.
[00:18:17.583 --> 00:18:27.328]  I'm not just here griping and yelling about Glenn Beck being a Judas goat or a Benedict Arnold because I'm mad that he reaches millions of more people than I do on television.
[00:18:27.849 --> 00:18:29.049]  I don't care at the end of the day.
[00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.791]  I'm about the mission and my children living in a free country.
[00:18:32.191 --> 00:18:34.452]  I want to believe in Michael Savage.
[00:18:35.733 --> 00:18:38.635]  I want to believe in Rush Limbaugh.
[00:18:38.655 --> 00:18:40.456]  I want to believe in Glenn Beck.
[00:18:41.752 --> 00:18:46.473]  But I can't forget Sean Hannity saying all militia should be arrested.
[00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:47.153]  That's a quote.
[00:18:47.754 --> 00:18:50.134]  Every child in America needs an implantable microchip.
[00:18:50.434 --> 00:18:51.315]  That's a video quote.
[00:18:52.015 --> 00:18:53.695]  It's in, what, Police State 3?
[00:18:55.816 --> 00:18:56.636]  Total enslavement.
[00:18:59.357 --> 00:19:06.819]  I mean, I remember Savage saying six years ago, anybody that criticizes the war is aiding Al-Qaeda and needs to be put in a forced labor camp.
[00:19:09.141 --> 00:19:20.584]  Well, I mean, Mr. Savage, the Patriot Act, even if the Muslims are evil, bloodthirsty demons that do want to kill us, I mean, if your paradigm is accurate, for the case of debate, let's say it might be.
[00:19:24.786 --> 00:19:35.169]  For 12, 13 years, I have been getting internal law enforcement reports and training manuals where it's all for conservatives and gun owners and landowners and veterans.
[00:19:36.658 --> 00:19:39.100]  So, I mean, you're talking about putting people in forced labor camps.
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.521]  Don't you understand, Savage?
[00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:43.164]  The forced labor camp is for good Americans.
[00:19:43.844 --> 00:19:48.628]  See, that's why you can't say, put some group who you say is bad in the forced labor camp.
[00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:52.832]  And of course, I don't believe the Muslims are evil, bloodthirsty killers that want to get us.
[00:19:53.573 --> 00:19:59.478]  But, look, I've already started getting into this and I shouldn't have because I've got all the notes I've written where I really want to focus and cover every angle of this.
[00:20:02.093 --> 00:20:06.955]  The economy is crumbling, debts soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:20:07.855 --> 00:20:19.040]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:27.483]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:20:28.203 --> 00:20:31.865]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.
[00:20:32.748 --> 00:20:48.072]  Now I'm offering 50 all-organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planner, and a CD teaching you how to save seeds so your children's children will always have healthy food.
[00:20:48.912 --> 00:20:50.732]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:20:51.633 --> 00:20:57.074]  I'm Vic John Lipscomb and my company is survivalistseeds.com.
[00:21:00.615 --> 00:21:05.079]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:21:05.299 --> 00:21:13.946]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water filtration systems.

[00:21:39.328 --> 00:21:43.191]  That's right, three sport Berkey water bottles and free shipping.
[00:21:43.411 --> 00:21:45.053]  An $87 value, yours free.
[00:21:45.273 --> 00:21:46.354]  Call the Berkey Guy at 1-877-886-3653.
[00:21:46.374 --> 00:21:46.574]  That's 1-877-886-3653.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:22:04.167]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:22:04.568 --> 00:22:09.991]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:22:10.451 --> 00:22:11.532]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:22:11.552 --> 00:22:15.615]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:22:16.255 --> 00:22:29.720]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:35.382]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:22:35.662 --> 00:22:41.564]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:22:45.729 --> 00:22:47.752]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:22:47.772 --> 00:22:47.832]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.941]  As gardeners, we can all relate.
[00:23:02.101 --> 00:23:04.461]  What do you do with all of the excess food that you grow?
[00:23:04.481 --> 00:23:12.164]  Freezing or canning may have been the process you've used, but the good folks at Excalibur Dehydrator have a healthy alternative to preserve the fruits of your labor.

[00:23:50.365 --> 00:23:51.125]  That's 1-800-875-4254 today!
[00:24:11.405 --> 00:24:14.510]  Alright, I'm gonna finish up with this whole Fox News situation.
[00:24:15.472 --> 00:24:20.961]  You've got the 5th Avenue, 6th Avenue, Bloodbath going on, NBC, CNN, Chiefs out.
[00:24:22.283 --> 00:24:25.588]  But why is Fox not just holding on to the ratings, but even growing?
[00:24:26.496 --> 00:24:30.658]  with some of its programs, because they at least will admit there's a world government.
[00:24:31.158 --> 00:24:39.322]  All over the European press, all over the foreign press, and even some of the US publications admit there's a world government now, but they say it's a good thing.
[00:24:39.922 --> 00:24:50.627]  Now the neocons and Republican hosts for decades said it didn't exist, they were the gatekeepers, it was the kook detector, if you talked about the CFR, you were a lunatic.
[00:24:51.684 --> 00:25:03.089]  Glenn Beck on Wednesday admitted that a member of British intelligence, Edward Mandel House, helped set up the Council on Foreign Relations and the Federal Reserve to take over this country.
[00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:04.670]  I mean, that's incredible.
[00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.291]  What is Fox News doing talking about that?
[00:25:07.851 --> 00:25:09.612]  Lou Dobbs didn't even go that far.
[00:25:10.092 --> 00:25:12.573]  And he, of course, was forced out of CNN.
[00:25:13.753 --> 00:25:17.095]  At the end of the day, it's a complex issue, and again, I'm going to do a report on it.
[00:25:18.214 --> 00:25:21.236]  It mainly shows how we've caused a huge awakening.
[00:25:21.336 --> 00:25:22.797]  You have caused a huge awakening.
[00:25:23.477 --> 00:25:28.700]  Where the controlled left has to now admit world government's real, but say it's a good thing.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:37.464]  And the controlled right has to come out and limitedly admit there's a world government, and that it's authoritarian and tyrannical.
[00:25:38.505 --> 00:25:42.467]  But they still support the main goals of the globalists.
[00:25:42.627 --> 00:25:43.948]  And here's the key.
[00:25:44.588 --> 00:25:47.610]  But he gets better and better, so we're hoping, you know, he's going in the right direction.
[00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:54.702]  He tells you that Van Jones is the top of this.
[00:25:54.902 --> 00:25:58.945]  He puts their photos up, and that this is the elite, and that it's Cass Sunstein.
[00:25:59.205 --> 00:26:04.329]  Those are mid-level minions on the left arm of the controlled system, and they know that.
[00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:14.598]  And the writers for Glenn Beck and others are showing that they have a high level of understanding of the eugenics planetary dictatorship that they're now setting up.
[00:26:16.502 --> 00:26:19.465]  And so, that means they understand the rest of the paradigm.
[00:26:19.865 --> 00:26:25.250]  And they're not telling you it's the Fortune 100 that are openly calling for a world government.
[00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:27.752]  The banks, the oil companies, all of it.
[00:26:28.433 --> 00:26:36.040]  They're telling you it's a bunch of professors and leftists who are only carrying out one piece of the overall agenda.
[00:26:37.181 --> 00:26:38.082]  And that's the big issue.
[00:26:40.663 --> 00:26:58.190]  But this is going to be good for my radio show, my websites, that this information is becoming so widespread, they can take baby steps now with Beck and others, and then they can find the deep analysis and the full spectrum breakdown here on this show.
[00:27:01.095 --> 00:27:11.486]  But to actually be really watching now and really listening, something I hadn't been doing but off and on, is freaking me out because I'm literally producing, I had said 30-40% of Beck's show.
[00:27:13.433 --> 00:27:24.140]  Inadvertently, they take what I do and then change it, but use it word for word in many cases, that now what I talk about is going to be on Glenn Beck in two, three weeks.
[00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:26.642]  The guests we have on are going to be on in two, three weeks.
[00:27:27.302 --> 00:27:33.647]  Word for word, what I say is taken, changed slightly, and put out on his radio and TV show.
[00:27:34.127 --> 00:27:37.850]  It's amazing the responsibility I've got.
[00:27:38.658 --> 00:27:41.259]  And I've always, you know, said it's not about Alex Jones.
[00:27:41.339 --> 00:27:42.119]  All of us are leaders.
[00:27:42.139 --> 00:27:43.060]  We've got to take action.
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.960]  That's the power of my great audience.
[00:27:46.061 --> 00:27:49.122]  But I have to face up to the fact that I've got to go to the next level.
[00:27:49.202 --> 00:27:50.282]  I've got to be more professional.
[00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:51.762]  I've got to be more focused.
[00:27:52.123 --> 00:27:54.403]  Because, I mean, nobody's telling Alex Jones what to do.
[00:27:55.504 --> 00:27:57.804]  I say, hang that light here, put a camera there.
[00:27:58.985 --> 00:28:00.105]  I gather the news.
[00:28:01.046 --> 00:28:02.406]  My crew brings me news.
[00:28:02.786 --> 00:28:03.426]  I go over it.
[00:28:03.686 --> 00:28:04.827]  There's no teleprompters.
[00:28:04.847 --> 00:28:06.187]  There's no makeup person.
[00:28:06.227 --> 00:28:07.688]  There's no nothing.
[00:28:08.635 --> 00:28:14.417]  What does that say about my message, and my perspective, and my analysis of the New World Order?
[00:28:15.417 --> 00:28:31.722]  That the most powerful news network in the world, and I have this confirmed from people inside, but you can see it every night, takes what I do, even down to the props he uses.
[00:28:34.247 --> 00:28:43.952]  The words he, I mean everything, it's got to be 60% of what he says on the radio and TV is directly from this show.
[00:28:44.092 --> 00:28:53.796]  I mean imagine if you were Alex Jones and whatever you talk about, Glenn Beck has people literally taking and then putting out.
[00:29:00.563 --> 00:29:09.747]  And Aaron Dykes, while I was sitting there watching Wednesday's show and Thursday's show last night that they taped for me, they were fast forwarding and showing me selects of it in our editing booth.
[00:29:11.228 --> 00:29:20.752]  I was watching it up on the big screen TV in that room and Aaron looked at me very knowingly and he said, looks like you got co-opted even though you never sold out.
[00:29:22.603 --> 00:29:26.085]  And Aaron says this is a, and I tend to agree with him, a complex psy-op.
[00:29:26.125 --> 00:29:27.405]  If they can't beat us, they'll join us.
[00:29:27.685 --> 00:29:29.126]  They're playing the part of opposition.
[00:29:29.466 --> 00:29:30.907]  All the Republicans are out of power.
[00:29:31.227 --> 00:29:35.909]  As soon as they get into power, it'll be just like Keith Olbermann was anti-tyranny when Bush was in.
[00:29:35.949 --> 00:29:36.909]  Now he's pro-tyranny.
[00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:40.431]  And I tend to agree, but this is bigger than what Keith Olbermann did.
[00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:43.933]  I mean, this is unprecedented, what's being put on television.
[00:29:45.053 --> 00:29:47.994]  I mean, I'm literally on television every night through Glenn Beck.
[00:29:48.395 --> 00:29:48.915]  It's bizarre.
[00:29:50.185 --> 00:29:53.187]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.128 --> 00:29:56.890]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.392 --> 00:30:14.882]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:30:15.863 --> 00:30:19.546]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:20.566 --> 00:30:32.558]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:30:33.318 --> 00:30:40.585]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:30:41.266 --> 00:30:50.869]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:54.911]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:30:55.571 --> 00:30:58.692]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:30:59.252 --> 00:31:03.474]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:03.794 --> 00:31:04.074]  Number 1.
[00:31:04.714 --> 00:31:07.855]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.135 --> 00:31:08.695]  Number 2.
[00:31:08.995 --> 00:31:13.557]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:13.877 --> 00:31:14.337]  It's true.
[00:31:14.617 --> 00:31:19.179]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:19.499 --> 00:31:20.039]  Number 3.
[00:31:20.319 --> 00:31:23.601]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:23.901 --> 00:31:27.602]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:27.822 --> 00:31:28.362]  Number 4.
[00:31:28.602 --> 00:31:30.983]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.363 --> 00:31:34.745]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.045 --> 00:31:35.265]  Number 5.
[00:31:35.845 --> 00:31:39.747]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:39.987 --> 00:31:44.749]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:49.070]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:50.771]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:32:17.797 --> 00:32:19.638]  Even for efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:19.818 --> 00:32:23.059]  This will require their first price increase in three years.
[00:32:23.339 --> 00:32:34.604]  The most important thing Americans can do for their own freedom and survival in these hardest of times is to get supplies of high-quality storable food because of the huge response to this buy three and get one free special.
[00:32:34.944 --> 00:32:38.846]  eFoodsDirect.com will continue this special until September 27th.
[00:32:39.126 --> 00:32:42.047]  Right now, you can buy three and get one free at the old prices.
[00:32:42.388 --> 00:32:45.529]  But move fast, because this offer ends September 27th.
[00:32:45.689 --> 00:32:46.029]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:46.049 --> 00:32:47.890]  Or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:48.410]  That's 800-409-5633.
[00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.712]  Or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:33:10.179 --> 00:33:12.861]  Okay, let's blitz through news now.
[00:33:12.881 --> 00:33:15.283]  Starting with some InfoWars.com news.
[00:33:15.484 --> 00:33:21.609]  Tim, our office manager, came in to me after the radio show yesterday.
[00:33:38.035 --> 00:33:40.497]  And he said, I've got some bad news for you.
[00:33:41.497 --> 00:33:43.178]  Give me a document cam shot on this, guys.
[00:33:43.218 --> 00:33:43.639]  Thank you.
[00:33:44.599 --> 00:33:52.084]  Department of Transportation Delaware sent to our office first offense warning.
[00:33:52.124 --> 00:33:54.105]  It says, the next time I'll be fined.
[00:33:54.125 --> 00:34:00.549]  And it has a photo of a homemade Infowars.com sign on a telephone pole.
[00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:04.492]  And they say they have proof that I posted this.
[00:34:06.227 --> 00:34:09.829]  And, of course, I wrote a little comment on Kurt Nemo's story dealing with this.
[00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:10.889]  Note from Alex Jones.
[00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:12.290]  This is asinine.
[00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.431]  The sign in question is clearly homemade.
[00:34:14.451 --> 00:34:19.353]  If an Obama sign was put on my utility pole, would the state issue Obama a citation?
[00:34:19.874 --> 00:34:24.996]  If somebody made a homemade Obama sign and posted it, would they send a citation or a ticket to Obama?
[00:34:25.717 --> 00:34:30.339]  This is something straight out of Stalinist Russia or Mao's China, where you're guilty for something somebody else does.
[00:34:31.764 --> 00:34:33.164]  I am out of the state's jurisdiction.
[00:34:33.445 --> 00:34:35.885]  The next time a sign is put up, they will fine me, they say.
[00:34:36.445 --> 00:34:38.546]  If I don't pay the fine, they will issue an arrest warrant.
[00:34:38.866 --> 00:34:40.047]  Then I'll be forced to sue them.
[00:34:40.607 --> 00:34:44.688]  They will undoubtedly lose and have to pay me money taken from Delawareans.
[00:34:45.468 --> 00:34:46.809]  So, I've called their office.
[00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:52.550]  Their phone numbers are on this flyer, scanned in, up at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:54.151 --> 00:34:58.972]  The headline is, Delaware Sends InfoWars.com First Offense Warning for Sign.
[00:34:59.333 --> 00:35:00.413]  Now, we do tell people
[00:35:01.394 --> 00:35:08.479]  To post flyers in public legal areas, check your local laws, to expose dangerous fluoride in the water and things like that.
[00:35:08.679 --> 00:35:16.684]  I guess it's a good idea to put up InfoWars.com signs, but do it on your own property or do it in areas where it's legal or lawful to post signs.
[00:35:18.406 --> 00:35:25.791]  I mean, we've had cases of people spray painting InfoWars.com in Oregon, and then another case in Colorado.
[00:35:26.451 --> 00:35:32.154]  And I got threatening calls from local officials telling me to stop it or they'd come after me criminally.
[00:35:32.474 --> 00:35:34.995]  I'm not spray-painting things on road signs in Colorado.
[00:35:35.595 --> 00:35:39.477]  I got a threatening email from a government in New Zealand, a local government.
[00:35:39.817 --> 00:35:40.898]  We're an abandoned building.
[00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:42.919]  Somebody spray-painted infowars.com on it.
[00:35:43.379 --> 00:35:47.044]  But you know, at the end of the day, we have banks stealing trillions of dollars from us.
[00:35:47.344 --> 00:35:48.926]  They're trying to start World War III.
[00:35:50.508 --> 00:35:57.556]  There's all sorts of corruption going on in government, and they should have better things to do than worry about somebody putting up a sign for InfoWars.com.
[00:35:59.719 --> 00:36:01.901]  But it just shows how crazy government is.
[00:36:01.921 --> 00:36:04.544]  I mean, in the past, government would use common sense.
[00:36:04.564 --> 00:36:06.085]  And no, I don't have offices in Delaware.
[00:36:06.466 --> 00:36:07.867]  I don't think I've ever been to Delaware.
[00:36:07.887 --> 00:36:09.068]  I've been on some long road trips.
[00:36:09.409 --> 00:36:10.790]  My parents took me on to the East Coast.
[00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:12.051]  But I don't think I've ever been in Delaware.
[00:36:12.692 --> 00:36:13.473]  I'm pretty sure I have.
[00:36:13.493 --> 00:36:16.175]  And I asked my dad last night, and he says, no, we've never taken you there.
[00:36:16.716 --> 00:36:17.397]  I've never been there.
[00:36:18.438 --> 00:36:22.342]  And they're just sending me tickets.
[00:36:23.703 --> 00:36:28.725]  And it's why federal and state courts have thrown out red light tickets over and over again.
[00:36:29.366 --> 00:36:38.430]  Under state law, you've got to have an officer sworn and bonded who's a witness to show up in court, write you a ticket.
[00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:44.713]  You can't have a computer hooked to a camera run by some defense contractor send you tickets.
[00:36:45.441 --> 00:36:46.922]  They're illegal, they're unlawful.
[00:36:47.182 --> 00:36:51.523]  They need to be removed, and they are being removed in places like Arizona and Southern California.
[00:36:52.264 --> 00:37:00.707]  A few months ago in Texas, a state court told the company that runs red lights in Austin that they hadn't gotten a private investigator permit.
[00:37:01.027 --> 00:37:05.648]  They claim they have to get that too if they're going to be issuing these tickets.
[00:37:06.469 --> 00:37:08.329]  You're not offered court to challenge these.
[00:37:13.021 --> 00:37:16.325]  The agency that's doing this, this private agency, is just continuing.
[00:37:16.365 --> 00:37:18.367]  So it's another example of...
[00:37:19.645 --> 00:37:21.266]  Lawlessness that's going on.
[00:37:22.126 --> 00:37:27.669]  I wanted to get into some good news today for folks as well.
[00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:34.933]  The Disclose Act, which makes McCain-Feingold's restrictions on free speech look tame, has been defeated.
[00:37:34.953 --> 00:37:42.758]  It would make any public interest group, like Gun Owners of America, disclose the names of donors in certain political advertisements.
[00:37:43.418 --> 00:37:46.580]  So, the massive attack on free speech.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:58.287]  Continuing with other good news, we have, of course, a few days ago the DREAM Act to legalize a bunch of illegal aliens and give them free college tuition and put them in the military.
[00:37:58.607 --> 00:37:59.267]  That's been defeated.
[00:37:59.568 --> 00:38:06.892]  Meanwhile, the Republicans are back with their contract on America Part 2, GOP pledge to America laced with Tea Party slogans.
[00:38:07.353 --> 00:38:14.597]  And you notice that Boehner and the scores of other Congress people that stood with him with their pledge for America
[00:38:15.518 --> 00:38:17.920]  Pledged to America they were not wearing ties.
[00:38:18.241 --> 00:38:19.782]  Oh, they're the common people.
[00:38:20.062 --> 00:38:22.164]  It shows how coordinated all of this is.
[00:38:23.345 --> 00:38:26.188]  They all got together and said, don't wear ties, dress down.
[00:38:27.509 --> 00:38:29.932]  It's form over reality.
[00:38:31.079 --> 00:38:39.626]  And if we have people like Newt Gingrich leading this conservative revolution, we're going to end up in the same place we were in the mid-1990s.
[00:38:40.046 --> 00:38:42.308]  It's going to be sabotaged from within.
[00:38:42.328 --> 00:38:46.871]  And that is exactly what's going on with this today.
[00:38:47.191 --> 00:38:49.053]  And I, frankly, am sick of it.
[00:38:49.233 --> 00:38:50.033]  I am tired of it.
[00:38:51.454 --> 00:38:58.059]  And watching two of Glenn Beck's shows yesterday evening, there was a lot of little red flags I did see.
[00:38:58.099 --> 00:38:59.841]  I'm trying to encourage the fact that he's getting better.
[00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:02.089]  But that's to gain people's trust, no doubt.
[00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:07.511]  Because the neocons know how powerful this anti-globalist movement is, and they know they can't tell us it doesn't exist anymore.
[00:39:07.831 --> 00:39:11.612]  So they have decided to have high ratings and be successful, and tell part of the truth.
[00:39:12.132 --> 00:39:15.413]  But again, I'm hoping it moves in the right direction, so I'm trying to be positive here.
[00:39:16.334 --> 00:39:20.575]  But, he got up there and he said there are real conspiracy theories.
[00:39:21.949 --> 00:39:24.350]  And by that, things that are not true.
[00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.631]  And he said there is no truth to the birther story.
[00:39:27.931 --> 00:39:31.732]  Hillary Clinton created that story, which there's not a lot of evidence of that.
[00:39:31.772 --> 00:39:37.394]  There's a little bit that some Democrats did question, you know, where he was really from, because that was the scuttlebutt within the party.
[00:39:39.042 --> 00:39:47.785]  And he went on to say basically that Newt Gingrich was good somehow and that Newt Gingrich had never said that the birther issue was real.
[00:39:48.405 --> 00:39:52.267]  This is a guy who wants global taxes, global carbon taxes, and one world government.
[00:39:52.487 --> 00:39:53.867]  He's written multiple books on it.
[00:39:54.187 --> 00:39:56.128]  He has TV ads promoting carbon taxes.
[00:39:57.305 --> 00:40:01.468]  And I had to hear about how Newt Gingrich was good, and the birthers are bad.
[00:40:01.508 --> 00:40:13.156]  Look, the birthers have legitimate concerns, and going back a year ago, I said I didn't know if it was true or not, but there was some evidence, and that it looked like a cover-up was going on, because he never released the original birth certificate.
[00:40:15.697 --> 00:40:17.638]  But since then, I've researched it in depth.
[00:40:17.738 --> 00:40:19.538]  He was an Indonesian citizen.
[00:40:19.778 --> 00:40:21.539]  He changed his name to Barry Sitaro.
[00:40:22.179 --> 00:40:25.700]  And under federal law, that made him ineligible to be president.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.182]  Now, you notice that that will never be touched by Fox News.
[00:40:30.702 --> 00:40:34.163]  Oh, they'll sit there all day long saying the birther issue is a fraud.
[00:40:35.603 --> 00:40:36.764]  And that it's run by Hillary.
[00:40:37.204 --> 00:40:38.824]  Hillary is in the White House.
[00:40:39.205 --> 00:40:40.385]  She's a cabinet member.
[00:40:40.425 --> 00:40:42.406]  She is the head of the State Department.
[00:40:43.186 --> 00:40:43.426]  Okay?
[00:40:44.565 --> 00:40:45.706]  She's the Secretary of State.
[00:40:46.986 --> 00:40:47.907]  Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:40:47.927 --> 00:40:51.649]  I mean, the Clintons are puppeteering Obama.
[00:40:52.529 --> 00:40:56.631]  So now they're claiming that there are these fissures within the Democratic Party itself.
[00:40:56.671 --> 00:40:58.212]  I mean, this is an asinine joke.
[00:40:58.512 --> 00:41:00.673]  So, Newt Gingrich's good, Bertha's bad.
[00:41:00.693 --> 00:41:12.460]  But, side issue, it's just, ladies and gentlemen, don't let anybody tell you, flat out, with no evidence, that there's no evidence, without giving any proof, that there's nothing to the Bertha issue.
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.921]  There is a lot to the birther issue.
[00:41:15.241 --> 00:41:17.402]  And he does have a grandmother saying he was born there.
[00:41:17.682 --> 00:41:19.823]  There is a statue there saying he was born there.
[00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:27.647]  We've got three different video clips of Michelle Sotaro, aka Michelle Obama, saying he is Kenyan-born and is a Kenyan.
[00:41:29.148 --> 00:41:30.568]  But forget that.
[00:41:30.769 --> 00:41:32.229]  Forget the birther issue.
[00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:38.672]  What we've got to push, because then everything he's done will then be struck down in the courts.
[00:41:39.133 --> 00:41:41.694]  Everything he's done, retroactively, will be thrown out.
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:50.150]  Is the fact that he committed treason, violating Article 1, Section 9, when he seated himself as the head of the United Nations Security Council.
[00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:51.632]  That had never been done.
[00:41:52.313 --> 00:41:55.737]  And that is treason, according to the Constitution.
[00:41:56.078 --> 00:41:56.558]  Period.
[00:41:56.759 --> 00:41:58.341]  We cover it in my film, Fall of the Republic.
[00:41:59.738 --> 00:42:07.320]  And we've also, it's a double-edged prong here, we've got to get it out to everybody that his real name is Barry Sotero.
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.281]  He's got another name, too.
[00:42:09.801 --> 00:42:11.161]  I mean, there's a whole bunch of these names.
[00:42:11.641 --> 00:42:13.102]  And he did live in Indonesia.
[00:42:13.682 --> 00:42:15.102]  He did give up his citizenship.
[00:42:15.662 --> 00:42:18.963]  Look, if you moved to Iran and gave up your U.S.
[00:42:18.983 --> 00:42:24.425]  citizenship, or you moved to Indonesia and you gave up your citizenship, you couldn't come back here and run for president.
[00:42:24.705 --> 00:42:26.165]  It is completely elementary.
[00:42:26.686 --> 00:42:27.486]  It is a fact.
[00:42:28.426 --> 00:42:35.010]  And, you know, if Beck wants to bash Hillary Clinton all day, which is fine with me, I won't lose any sleep over that.
[00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:44.315]  Remember fundraisers being held for Hillary Clinton when they were trying to get her into power in 2007 by Rupert Murdoch?
[00:42:44.976 --> 00:42:48.418]  Multi-million dollar fundraisers held at his private penthouse.
[00:42:48.438 --> 00:42:49.558]  In fact, guys, Google that.
[00:42:49.578 --> 00:42:50.299]  People won't remember it.
[00:42:50.759 --> 00:42:52.440]  Rupert Murdoch held fundraisers for Hillary.
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:52.820]  Pull it up.
[00:42:54.461 --> 00:42:55.542]  Let's pull that up for people.
[00:42:57.130 --> 00:43:09.934]  Now, I do know some Navy SEALs, retired, who did guard Mr. Ailes, the head of News Corp, the head of Fox News, a division of News Corp.
[00:43:10.974 --> 00:43:25.699]  And this goes back 15 years ago when he was scared to death with multiple bodyguards, this is directly from the source, with multiple bodyguards, afraid of the Clintons killing him.
[00:43:27.401 --> 00:43:33.487]  And I'm trying to get one of these guys on the air, or I may be able to get one of their associates on, who was also witness to this.
[00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:40.634]  You might be able to imagine where I learned things from Navy SEALs, but I'll just leave it at that.
[00:43:41.295 --> 00:43:46.320]  The point is that there are some fissures in this whole power structure.
[00:43:47.864 --> 00:43:49.946]  People are enemies, then they become allies later.
[00:43:49.986 --> 00:43:51.668]  But yeah, there was the MSNBC headline.
[00:43:51.688 --> 00:43:52.408]  Let's put it back up.
[00:43:52.428 --> 00:43:53.730]  The guys found it very quickly.
[00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:54.310]  Great job.
[00:43:55.031 --> 00:43:57.593]  Murdoch fundraiser for Clinton creates buzz.
[00:43:58.054 --> 00:44:01.917]  MSNBC running an AP article.
[00:44:02.778 --> 00:44:05.340]  And let's blow up that screen so I can see the year.
[00:44:06.241 --> 00:44:07.062]  That was in 2006.
[00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:15.665]  2006, 2006-2007, I remember he had multiple.
[00:44:15.685 --> 00:44:17.366]  That was just one of the big ones, one of the first ones.
[00:44:17.846 --> 00:44:18.586]  So there you have it.
[00:44:19.827 --> 00:44:25.470]  The point is that when these people get behind closed doors together, more often than not, they're on the same team.
[00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:33.214]  They're the ruling class, and one group, the Democrats, gets back into power playing the part of anti-establishment under Bush.
[00:44:35.015 --> 00:44:36.376]  Bush is anti-establishment.
[00:44:36.396 --> 00:44:36.816]  He gets in.
[00:44:38.865 --> 00:44:47.090]  From Clinton, then the Democrats pose as anti-establishment with Obama, he gets into power, but they're all financed by the very same interest.
[00:44:47.491 --> 00:45:00.920]  But there is some truth to in the mid-1990s, Ailes was completely paranoid, shaking in fear, and hiding from the Clintons with multiple Navy SEALs protecting him 24-7.
[00:45:03.783 --> 00:45:05.264]  And I've confirmed that about Beck.
[00:45:05.364 --> 00:45:10.186]  Beck has FBI, retired FBI, protecting him from the government.
[00:45:11.607 --> 00:45:12.588]  From assassins.
[00:45:13.948 --> 00:45:17.990]  Beck's main fear is A, the government, and then B, patriot groups.
[00:45:20.692 --> 00:45:23.053]  I guess he's afraid of my listeners or something because I've criticized him.
[00:45:23.073 --> 00:45:24.554]  Beck, we wish no harm upon you.
[00:45:24.914 --> 00:45:25.194]  Okay?
[00:45:25.454 --> 00:45:28.576]  Alright, I'm already digressing here and I've got all this, all this news to get to.
[00:45:28.636 --> 00:45:29.276]  It's just crazy.
[00:45:30.117 --> 00:45:30.357]  Okay.
[00:45:31.598 --> 00:45:33.780]  Covered some of that good news there.
[00:45:34.541 --> 00:45:35.562]  You know the bad news.
[00:45:35.602 --> 00:45:51.159]  The Democrats have decided to punt, and they are not going to vote this year ahead of the election, 2010, on keeping some of the Bush-era tax cuts that were across the board for the poor, the middle class, the rich, and the ultra-rich.
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:55.101]  And so everyone will have massive tax increases.
[00:45:55.702 --> 00:46:03.125]  Obama breaking his promise for not just keeping it the same, but middle class tax cuts coming into play next year.
[00:46:05.046 --> 00:46:07.147]  And the Republicans aren't squealing too much about this.
[00:46:07.167 --> 00:46:09.268]  They think they're going to get big political bonus points.
[00:46:09.648 --> 00:46:14.450]  And let's see if once they're in power, if they actually get rid of tax cuts across the board.
[00:46:16.151 --> 00:46:18.332]  Or bring the tax cuts back across the board.
[00:46:20.003 --> 00:46:23.904]  Okay, let's see if they actually get rid of these tax increases.
[00:46:24.044 --> 00:46:25.924]  Let's see if that happens.
[00:46:25.984 --> 00:46:26.724]  Let's remember.
[00:46:27.044 --> 00:46:29.665]  Let's not get so happy feeling like we're winners.
[00:46:30.205 --> 00:46:33.485]  I remember trying to talk to Bill Clinton supporters when I was first on air in 95.
[00:46:34.165 --> 00:46:36.606]  And I'd say, Bill Clinton is sold out to the Communist Chinese.
[00:46:36.646 --> 00:46:37.366]  He's a globalist.
[00:46:37.726 --> 00:46:40.687]  Strobe Talbot, his Undersecretary of State, wants world government.
[00:46:41.067 --> 00:46:41.967]  Here's all the quotes.
[00:46:42.007 --> 00:46:44.707]  And they'd say, you're just mad Republican that you lost.
[00:46:44.747 --> 00:46:47.268]  And I'd say, look, I'm not a Republican.
[00:46:47.388 --> 00:46:48.648]  I am a constitutionalist.
[00:46:50.888 --> 00:46:55.169]  And the Republicans do at least give window dressing more, you know, to that view.
[00:46:55.609 --> 00:46:57.630]  But I said it's a controlled left-right paradigm.
[00:46:58.050 --> 00:46:59.610]  Bill Clinton works for the globalists.
[00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:06.592]  His mentor, Carol Quigley, wrote a book about this and admitted they control both parties and that there isn't a dime's worth of difference at the leadership levels.
[00:47:06.852 --> 00:47:10.893]  And they just laugh and say, you're angry, you lost, get over it.
[00:47:14.121 --> 00:47:21.248]  We're associating their personal power and their identity with Bill Clinton, who they saw basically as their daddy.
[00:47:22.329 --> 00:47:25.332]  And then everybody gets mad after Clinton of eight years, so Bush comes in.
[00:47:25.993 --> 00:47:31.258]  And Republicans, I said, look, he's trying to pass the assault weapons ban, reauthorize it.
[00:47:34.335 --> 00:47:36.036]  Expanding NAFTA and GATT.
[00:47:36.737 --> 00:47:38.618]  He's not really fighting carbon taxes.
[00:47:39.339 --> 00:47:40.380]  He's doing all these things.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.741]  The Patriot Act's been written for the American people.
[00:47:42.801 --> 00:47:43.462]  Section 802.
[00:47:45.123 --> 00:47:45.724]  On and on and on.
[00:47:45.744 --> 00:47:46.905]  Look at these federal reports.
[00:47:46.925 --> 00:47:50.187]  Their training, almost all their training, is not to fight foreign Muslims.
[00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:51.808]  It's for the American people.
[00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:54.010]  And they'd say, shut up, liberal!
[00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.750]  Shut up!
[00:47:54.831 --> 00:47:59.034]  You're just mad that George Bush beat Al Gore.
[00:48:00.509 --> 00:48:02.093]  And I'd say, I hate Al Gore.
[00:48:02.895 --> 00:48:03.857]  No, you don't.
[00:48:04.258 --> 00:48:05.440]  Don't try to trick me.
[00:48:06.002 --> 00:48:09.690]  You know, don't try to trick me, you know, you liberal.
[00:48:10.663 --> 00:48:14.726]  You're just mad that George W. Bush, you know, beat your guy Al Gore.
[00:48:15.506 --> 00:48:18.028]  And I said, no, no, no.
[00:48:18.108 --> 00:48:20.029]  I said, look at election fraud.
[00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:26.013]  The machines are cheating whoever the anti-establishment candidate is or whoever the elite wants to get in.
[00:48:26.334 --> 00:48:29.916]  They cheat for them because it's part of a sharing of power in the left-right paradigm.
[00:48:31.017 --> 00:48:32.518]  These machines are questionable.
[00:48:32.878 --> 00:48:34.079]  Let's just look at the evidence.
[00:48:34.139 --> 00:48:35.000]  They go, shut up.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.863]  You're mad that Al Gore lost.
[00:48:41.624 --> 00:48:45.108]  And then Obama came to power, and I said, look at his advisors.
[00:48:45.528 --> 00:48:46.629]  He's for the bailout.
[00:48:47.009 --> 00:48:48.291]  He's for the wars.
[00:48:48.791 --> 00:48:50.313]  He's against the Constitution.
[00:48:51.234 --> 00:48:52.395]  He may be a foreigner.
[00:48:52.695 --> 00:48:54.096]  We know he gave up his citizenship.
[00:48:54.116 --> 00:48:58.421]  And they'd say, shut up, right-wing Fox News, you know, Glenn Beck copycat.
[00:48:58.441 --> 00:48:59.982]  And I'd say, I don't even watch Glenn Beck.
[00:49:00.663 --> 00:49:02.244]  If anything, Glenn Beck copycat's me.
[00:49:02.385 --> 00:49:03.486]  No, no, no, no.
[00:49:05.962 --> 00:49:15.227]  So, remember, when the Republicans take the House, maybe even the Senate, and definitely by 2012, unless Obama stages a nuke attack and declares martial law, and that could always happen, his handlers could do that.
[00:49:15.567 --> 00:49:16.928]  They're certainly hyping it right now.
[00:49:17.168 --> 00:49:18.249]  They're sending up trial balloons.
[00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:26.694]  But barring World War III or a staged nuke attack or something along those lines, Obama and all of the progressives are out of power.
[00:49:27.094 --> 00:49:28.815]  The globalist eugenicists is what they are.
[00:49:29.932 --> 00:49:43.564]  And then they'll put in eugenics light the Republicans and they'll pay a little lip service, change a few things, but Obama takes us a hundred miles, the Republicans take half of that away, but we're still all the way down the rat hole.
[00:49:44.805 --> 00:49:45.385]  We don't want...
[00:49:46.431 --> 00:49:49.653]  We don't want Republicans to just repeal some of it.
[00:49:49.933 --> 00:49:53.114]  They've got to get rid of everything that's been done since 1913.
[00:49:53.675 --> 00:49:56.316]  They've got to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[00:49:56.656 --> 00:49:59.478]  They've got to criminally charge these big central bankers.
[00:50:00.298 --> 00:50:02.539]  Or they're going to destroy our economy and our society.
[00:50:02.779 --> 00:50:03.580]  That's their plan.
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:08.362]  And Beck was admitting that, that the mega-elite want to destroy our economy by design.
[00:50:08.562 --> 00:50:11.264]  But he was saying the mega-elite were little communist professors.
[00:50:12.475 --> 00:50:12.675]  No.
[00:50:13.035 --> 00:50:16.056]  It's the mega-corporations that fund collectivism.
[00:50:16.577 --> 00:50:18.778]  And Beck's handlers know this.
[00:50:19.338 --> 00:50:23.499]  His latest faction book, Fiction That's Fact, admits it all.
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.480]  They have a high level of understanding.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.761]  They know all of this.
[00:50:26.981 --> 00:50:28.561]  And they knew this stuff ten years ago.
[00:50:29.602 --> 00:50:32.103]  When Limbaugh and others were saying none of this existed.
[00:50:33.874 --> 00:50:42.440]  So don't, two years from now, when I'm saying, look, the Republicans are not repealing all this stuff, don't sit there and go, shut up, commie.
[00:50:43.241 --> 00:50:43.661]  Okay?
[00:50:44.421 --> 00:50:48.004]  I'm a commie when a Republican's in.
[00:50:48.164 --> 00:50:49.745]  I'm a fascist when a Democrat's in.
[00:50:49.825 --> 00:50:58.291]  No, I'm a constitutionalist patriot who wants liberty and freedom and private property and the Second Amendment and the family protected.
[00:50:58.632 --> 00:50:59.052]  Period.
[00:51:00.563 --> 00:51:04.405]  If your handgun is loaded and easy to get to, it's also dangerous.
[00:51:04.885 --> 00:51:09.647]  What if you could reach your loaded handgun instantly and still provide a margin of safety for your family?

[00:52:04.303 --> 00:52:05.063]  What have we got?
[00:52:05.283 --> 00:52:07.424]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:07.744 --> 00:52:08.485]  A republic.
[00:52:08.745 --> 00:52:11.326]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:11.386 --> 00:52:13.306]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:13.647 --> 00:52:15.567]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:15.667 --> 00:52:21.049]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[00:52:21.229 --> 00:52:24.891]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:25.251 --> 00:52:28.917]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:28.957 --> 00:52:29.918]  You're being warned.
[00:52:30.219 --> 00:52:31.060]  We have the facts.
[00:52:31.241 --> 00:52:32.362]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:32.402 --> 00:52:33.304]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:33.324 --> 00:52:34.145]  We have common law.
[00:52:34.205 --> 00:52:36.469]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:54:02.796 --> 00:54:08.824]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:09.425 --> 00:54:12.469]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:16.354 --> 00:54:19.798]  Coming up in about 40 minutes after our first guest leaves us...
[00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:25.652]  Establishment feigns outrage at Ahmadinejad's 9-1-1 rant.
[00:54:26.072 --> 00:54:31.014]  Key article by Paul Joseph Watson up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:54:31.835 --> 00:54:38.558]  And I want to go ahead and play a video clip of his speech yesterday at the United Nations in New York.
[00:54:38.578 --> 00:54:38.938]  Here it is.
[00:54:41.645 --> 00:54:44.809]  There were three viewpoints.
[00:54:45.189 --> 00:54:53.298]  First, that a very powerful and complex terrorist group, able to successfully cross all layers of the American intelligence and security, carried out the attack.
[00:54:53.839 --> 00:54:58.444]  This is a prevalent viewpoint which has been supported and mainly advocated by American statesmen.
[00:54:58.784 --> 00:55:00.765]  Second, that some segments within the U.S.
[00:55:00.805 --> 00:55:07.929]  government orchestrated the attack to reverse the declining American economy and its grips in the Middle East, in order to save the Zionist regime.
[00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:14.093]  The majority of the American people, as well as most nations and politicians around the world, agree with this view.
[00:55:15.594 --> 00:55:24.939]  Alright, now, if you look at the New York Times' Angus and Reed poll from five years ago, 84% of Americans questioned who really carried out the attack.
[00:55:26.055 --> 00:55:28.417]  I mean, our government admits they staged the Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:55:29.177 --> 00:55:30.698]  They have Operation Northwoods.
[00:55:30.798 --> 00:55:33.160]  That's declassified to stage 9-11 style attacks.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:38.744]  These corporate groups have taken over our country, have stolen $28 trillion the last two years.
[00:55:39.564 --> 00:55:47.630]  Bloomberg admits and reports, in multiple reports, Prudential admits that they basically took the death benefits of six million veterans and the U.S.
[00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:50.752]  government made a secret deal with them, the VA, to steal it.
[00:55:51.434 --> 00:56:01.597]  Now, I mean, the globalists didn't just kill a million Iraqis in the last seven, eight years in Iraq and stop there.
[00:56:02.597 --> 00:56:09.179]  We have corporate interests that control our government, and they also have financed and protected radical Muslim groups.
[00:56:10.233 --> 00:56:11.094]  That's on record.
[00:56:11.715 --> 00:56:14.458]  And so they create the crisis and then offer the solution.
[00:56:14.979 --> 00:56:16.160]  I mean, the smoking guns of 9-11.
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:18.002]  I'm going to write a story about that.
[00:56:18.242 --> 00:56:18.923]  We've written many.
[00:56:19.624 --> 00:56:21.226]  But dealing with the whistleblowers.
[00:56:21.666 --> 00:56:28.154]  Sabel Edmonds, translator, days before heard, quote, Al Qaeda working for the U.S.
[00:56:28.194 --> 00:56:28.594]  government.
[00:56:29.435 --> 00:56:31.637]  She told the 9-11 Commission that in closed hearings.
[00:56:32.698 --> 00:56:33.558]  You want whistleblowers?
[00:56:33.598 --> 00:56:38.963]  What about the police we've had on, like Bartmer and others, who heard the countdown to blow up Building 7?
[00:56:39.003 --> 00:56:44.327]  Then we have CNN with the video of the cops saying, get back, they're going to blow it up, that building's coming down.
[00:56:46.138 --> 00:56:48.701]  I mean, the evidence goes on and on and on.
[00:56:49.141 --> 00:56:51.304]  We know the official story is a lie.
[00:56:51.404 --> 00:56:52.966]  Six of the ten commissioners have said that.
[00:56:53.446 --> 00:56:56.510]  And so they go find somebody unpopular like Ahmed Dinegine.
[00:56:56.890 --> 00:57:00.835]  He comes out and says this, but mixes Israel into it.
[00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:08.022]  And then they say, oh my gosh, see, if you're a 9-11 truther, you're with Ahmed Dinejit.
[00:57:08.362 --> 00:57:15.047]  No, if you're a 9-11 truther, you're someone who looks at the facts and lets the chips fall where they may.
[00:57:16.047 --> 00:57:20.490]  And I was on the air years before 9-11 saying the government was going to stage major terror attacks.
[00:57:20.771 --> 00:57:25.574]  Two months before specifically saying they'll probably blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[00:57:25.894 --> 00:57:26.614]  How did I know that?
[00:57:26.975 --> 00:57:30.257]  I saw the media saying, here's Bin Laden, he's going to get you.
[00:57:30.537 --> 00:57:32.958]  When he attacks, we're going to take your rights to keep you safe.
[00:57:33.279 --> 00:57:50.229]  I saw them priming it, getting the public ready, just like they primed that day, and put out a secret Reuters report, this was later confirmed, I even predicted it'd be Reuters, because I know who feeds the BBC and CNN, that Building 7 fell in its own footprint from fires.
[00:57:51.383 --> 00:57:52.304]  Before it fell.
[00:57:52.484 --> 00:57:53.545]  They did a false start.
[00:57:53.986 --> 00:57:59.991]  Kind of like New Zealand, Australian and other papers reporting Lee Harvey Oswald had been arrested for shooting Kennedy.
[00:58:00.672 --> 00:58:04.836]  It was published before he was even arrested and his name was in the news here.
[00:58:05.257 --> 00:58:06.598]  They got their time zones off.
[00:58:06.838 --> 00:58:07.839]  They made mistakes.
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:10.321]  It's a false start.
[00:58:11.002 --> 00:58:12.283]  Just like they ran drills.
[00:58:13.579 --> 00:58:23.643]  of the very trains and the very bus being attacked at the very same locations at the same time that day with the metro underground and visor consultancy.
[00:58:25.423 --> 00:58:29.064]  They ran drills on 9-11 of the exact same targets being attacked the exact same time.
[00:58:29.144 --> 00:58:29.405]  Why?
[00:58:29.625 --> 00:58:36.587]  Because if the government or corporate groups staging the attacks get caught, they tell the rest of the government that doesn't know, oh, we were part of a drill.
[00:58:36.987 --> 00:58:37.967]  That's their cover.
[00:58:38.108 --> 00:58:39.028]  They always have a drill.
[00:58:41.263 --> 00:58:43.124]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:11.762]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.782 --> 01:00:16.063]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.583 --> 01:00:20.665]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.225 --> 01:00:33.149]  Alright, for the next 30 minutes, we're going to do an in-depth breakdown of what's been happening across the country.
[01:00:36.691 --> 01:00:40.894]  In Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, California, Missouri.
[01:00:41.554 --> 01:00:44.255]  Now, we knew about this back in the mid-90s.
[01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.470]  Right through 2000, 2005, 2010.
[01:00:47.271 --> 01:00:55.754]  You remember last January, February, we got the MIAC and Homeland Security reports from state and federal law enforcement separately.
[01:00:57.235 --> 01:01:05.698]  And it reported that the number one threat is returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, Bob Barr supporters, Second Amendment groups.
[01:01:06.999 --> 01:01:07.879]  And now they're out in the open.
[01:01:07.899 --> 01:01:12.161]  They say, yes, Homeland Security is for the American people.
[01:01:13.271 --> 01:01:17.474]  They sold it to you in the name of Al-Qaeda, but it's really for the American people.
[01:01:17.794 --> 01:01:18.815]  This is the big issue.
[01:01:19.836 --> 01:01:23.099]  And State Representative Daryl Metcalf joins us.
[01:01:23.579 --> 01:01:29.463]  He's the Assembly's number one conservative, multiple-time highest-ranking lawmaker of the Pennsylvania Liberty Index.
[01:01:31.405 --> 01:01:36.529]  And the website says State Legislators for LegalImmigration.com founder.
[01:01:38.141 --> 01:01:55.549]  And Darryl Metcalf joins us because his Second Amendment group was listed by this private group that was paid $125,000 to spy on Quakers, anti-war groups, groups against gas drilling, Second Amendment groups, tea parties, basically everybody being spied on.
[01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:57.370]  And he joins us now.
[01:01:57.610 --> 01:01:59.211]  Representative Metcalf, thanks for coming on.
[01:01:59.931 --> 01:02:00.491]  Good to be with you.
[01:02:00.551 --> 01:02:01.312]  Thanks for having me today.
[01:02:02.388 --> 01:02:03.489]  Let's start at the beginning.
[01:02:03.509 --> 01:02:14.037]  When you first learned about this, how your groups listed, the group, the head of state homeland security for two weeks, the Pittsburgh Post and others are reporting is in hiding.
[01:02:14.377 --> 01:02:15.418]  Won't talk to the media.
[01:02:15.438 --> 01:02:16.779]  The governor's apologized.
[01:02:17.259 --> 01:02:18.720]  There's lawsuits have been filed.
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.602]  Many are saying this is illegal what happened.
[01:02:21.022 --> 01:02:22.203]  I mean, let's start from the beginning.
[01:02:23.388 --> 01:02:49.555]  We actually had a taxpayer protest, a protest of the budget situation here in Pennsylvania back in June, on June 8th, and that's the first time that we were alerted that somebody has put out information that our rally that we were having on behalf of taxpayers in June to invite taxpayers to come to the state capitol of Pennsylvania, share with their legislators that they're fed up with the excessive spending, the excessive debt, that they want to do less spending, less
[01:02:50.235 --> 01:02:51.436]  We're good to go.
[01:03:08.727 --> 01:03:09.047]  We're good.
[01:03:27.441 --> 01:03:36.210]  And they write these reports for law enforcement to basically prejudice them against Second Amendment Tea Party groups, you name it.
[01:03:36.511 --> 01:03:45.580]  Representative, are you aware last year of the MIAC and Homeland Security reports where the federal government is writing these reports for the states demonizing returning veterans and gun owners?
[01:03:46.594 --> 01:03:47.856]  I am, actually.
[01:03:47.876 --> 01:03:57.427]  I signed on to a letter with one of my colleagues here in Pennsylvania to let the administration know how offensive that was and how wrong it was.
[01:03:57.447 --> 01:03:58.288]  I'm a veteran, a U.S.
[01:03:58.468 --> 01:03:59.509]  Army veteran myself.
[01:04:01.651 --> 01:04:02.532]  I am a gun owner.
[01:04:02.893 --> 01:04:12.242]  I have been for many, many years since the age of I think 13 or 14 when I bought my first shotgun as a young aspiring hunter in upstate New York.
[01:04:12.622 --> 01:04:24.294]  So I certainly fell into that list as a Christian, as a gun owner, as a veteran, which was a very offensive list that should have alerted every American that our government had gone off the
[01:04:24.434 --> 01:04:25.316]  I don't know.
[01:04:34.628 --> 01:04:40.211]  And now we learn, Representative Metcalfe, that it's more widespread than we had previously known.
[01:04:40.732 --> 01:04:54.600]  Let's talk about the head of your state homeland security who's in hiding, where he's hiding, how do we find out, lawsuits that are being filed over this, and we'll talk about the private group that was hired with taxpayer money to do this.
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.102]  It's all coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[01:04:58.402 --> 01:04:58.823]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.443 --> 01:05:03.286]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:07:03.991 --> 01:07:07.133]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:07.414 --> 01:07:07.974]  Number 2.
[01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:12.818]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:13.158 --> 01:07:13.598]  It's true.
[01:07:13.898 --> 01:07:18.462]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:18.782 --> 01:07:19.322]  Number 3.
[01:07:19.603 --> 01:07:22.885]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:23.185 --> 01:07:26.888]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:27.088 --> 01:07:27.648]  Number 4.
[01:07:27.889 --> 01:07:30.250]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:30.651 --> 01:07:34.033]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:34.334 --> 01:07:34.534]  Number 5.
[01:07:35.114 --> 01:07:39.037]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:39.257 --> 01:07:44.021]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:48.344]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:48.484 --> 01:07:50.045]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:50.265 --> 01:07:52.347]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:55.129]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:08:00.332 --> 01:08:05.896]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:08:06.357 --> 01:08:08.899]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:11.753 --> 01:08:15.839]  We've got Pennsylvania General Assemblyman Daryl Metcalf on.
[01:08:17.441 --> 01:08:20.826]  The website's www.repmetcalf.com.
[01:08:23.471 --> 01:08:24.953]  And here's some of the headlines.
[01:08:25.073 --> 01:08:28.135]  Quakers anti-war rallies on alert list.
[01:08:28.936 --> 01:08:31.238]  Pennsylvania Homeland Security targeted tea parties.
[01:08:31.258 --> 01:08:33.220]  I mean, basically everybody under the sun.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:38.625]  And it turns out they were involved with the G20 fingering groups that were arrested ahead of the summit.
[01:08:38.885 --> 01:08:41.307]  One of my reporters was arrested while they were there.
[01:08:41.327 --> 01:08:43.169]  And the police asked him, are you a terrorist?
[01:08:43.929 --> 01:08:45.130]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:08:46.111 --> 01:08:55.041]  And so specifically, Representative, we're hearing reports about lawsuits being filed, that this could be criminal.
[01:08:55.501 --> 01:08:58.424]  What do we know about this private group that was paid $125,000 just last year to compile these lists?
[01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:11.009]  Well, what I know is that this group compiled a list that they targeted two of my rallies that I hosted.
[01:09:11.249 --> 01:09:18.893]  One was a Second Amendment rally that you mentioned, which was actually our fifth annual rally for the right to keep and bear arms here in Pennsylvania.
[01:09:19.793 --> 01:09:20.634]  We're good to go.
[01:09:36.767 --> 01:09:38.148]  Participated in these rallies.
[01:09:38.188 --> 01:09:44.492]  We've had upwards of over a thousand attendees at last year's rally and probably seven, eight hundred at this year's rally.
[01:09:44.512 --> 01:09:50.455]  So our rallies appeared, a rally that I've been the key organizer of for Second Amendment.
[01:09:50.475 --> 01:09:51.096]  That's the main thing.
[01:09:51.136 --> 01:09:56.539]  As I said, five years in a row was on this list of the Institute of Terrorism Research and Response.
[01:09:56.579 --> 01:09:57.700]  They were employed by
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:09:58.760]  We're good.
[01:10:14.445 --> 01:10:22.068]  Well, they told my reporters in Pittsburgh that you're going to be on lists for the rest of your life, literally for no reason.
[01:10:44.557 --> 01:10:51.640]  I mean, that's outrageous for a law-abiding citizen, a law-abiding American, to become under scrutiny.
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:11:01.725]  A big brother like this is, you know, is the wrong use, is an abuse of power, is an abuse of our constitutional and a violation of our constitutional rights.
[01:11:02.565 --> 01:11:04.107]  We are going to be having a hearing.
[01:11:04.647 --> 01:11:06.969]  The State Senate in Pennsylvania is going to have a hearing.
[01:11:07.009 --> 01:11:20.919]  The Veterans Affairs and Emergency Repair Committee, I believe the name of the official name of the committee, under Senator Lisa Baker next Monday, will convene a hearing that they've granted to themselves subpoena power to try and get to the bottom of what's going on here.
[01:11:20.939 --> 01:11:22.180]  And I just send a letter
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.185]  I asked Senator Baker yesterday to ask her to help me because it is a Senate hearing.
[01:11:27.225 --> 01:11:32.570]  I'm a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, so I won't be in attendance at that or able to participate in that hearing.
[01:11:32.770 --> 01:11:44.282]  But I've asked Senator Baker to take my letter, take my questions, and pose those to those that they're questioning and to those that they're trying to obtain information from on Monday to hopefully help us get to the bottom of it.
[01:11:44.302 --> 01:11:46.304]  But besides myself as an elected official,
[01:11:46.844 --> 01:12:14.803]  Um, from, uh, you know, elected by tens of thousands of citizens in Pennsylvania to send me here to be their voice in state government, and that my name, uh, uh, rallies that I've been associated with, actually, um, you know, under my name, uh, appears on, uh, on this Institute of, uh, Terrorism Research Group, which, and, and then we find out from looking at their, at their website that, uh, one of their, uh, primary officers in this, uh, in this company is, is an American here in, in York County, Pennsylvania, but that, uh, one of their key officers
[01:12:15.263 --> 01:12:23.005]  Is a, uh, you know, is an Israeli, um, and it really appears more that, uh, that this, that this company is more based out of Israel than it is out of the states.
[01:12:23.585 --> 01:12:37.248]  Um, so, you know, there's, there's questions concerning, you know, how much of this, um, you know, I mean, what, what, what's the link here between, uh, Israeli defense forces that, uh, this company's claiming to, uh, work with, and, um, what, what, what's their contact with Mossad?
[01:12:37.288 --> 01:12:37.448]  I mean,
[01:12:37.828 --> 01:12:49.216]  You know, there's just a real eerie feeling that people get when you start hearing about this type of scrutiny, this type of surveillance by a government that's supposed to be a servant instead of a master.
[01:12:49.256 --> 01:12:50.036]  Is that any better?
[01:13:07.941 --> 01:13:09.923]  All right, I had an earpiece there.
[01:13:10.083 --> 01:13:11.125]  No, I could tell.
[01:13:11.485 --> 01:13:12.446]  We probably should have.
[01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:21.937]  Okay, now we can... No, no, I want you to start over with the Israeli Defense Force connections, because we've done some in-depth research on this, and so have Pennsylvania papers.
[01:13:22.377 --> 01:13:24.740]  This is clearly an Israeli company.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:31.365]  Now that the state head of Homeland Security, this former Special Forces member of the Army, he will not do press interviews.
[01:13:31.405 --> 01:13:32.466]  He's missing in action.
[01:13:32.946 --> 01:13:34.828]  The press is reporting he's disappeared.
[01:13:35.188 --> 01:13:36.649]  So that should be in the hearings as well.
[01:13:36.710 --> 01:13:49.880]  But recap what you were just saying about the eerie feeling, knowing that basically a foreign connected group to a foreign government is spying on Second Amendment rallies that a member of the state legislature has.
[01:13:50.281 --> 01:13:52.983]  I mean, this sounds like something out of Soviet Russia or something.
[01:13:53.749 --> 01:13:55.209]  Well, it does.
[01:13:55.329 --> 01:14:08.753]  It's something that you just see written in some of those science fiction spy-type novels, or maybe something that you did hear about that happened in reality in Russia or in the Eastern Bloc countries of yesterday.
[01:14:09.393 --> 01:14:19.396]  But for this company to have one of their officers, as revealed on their website, out of the York area here in Pennsylvania, York County area,
[01:14:19.969 --> 01:14:32.039]  But then one of the other primary officers being an individual who is an Israeli, and really from the website looks more like it's an Israeli-based company than an American-based company, claiming that they have ties with the Israeli Defense Forces.
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:45.570]  It really creates the eerie feeling that so many Americans express when you talk about big government, or government infringing your constitutional rights, starting to
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:50.243]  Starting to persecute American citizens because of their beliefs or their values.
[01:14:50.943 --> 01:15:04.174]  And as someone who's elected by tens of thousands of Pennsylvanians sent to the Capitol to be their voice, to express their will in government, to be their government, to serve them in government, and then to come under this type of scrutiny for rallies that I'm setting up with law-abiding citizens from across
[01:15:04.853 --> 01:15:10.279]  Well, clearly this is an attempt to intimidate people and to expand the Israeli connection.
[01:15:21.092 --> 01:15:32.418]  The Southern Poverty Law Center has some connections, but the ADL has been caught working with Mossad and more and more appears to be a foreign intelligence group operating in the United States.
[01:15:33.178 --> 01:15:43.463]  And now this further connection in Pennsylvania and the groups they listed mirrors the ADL reports
[01:15:43.843 --> 01:15:48.507]  Where we know the federal government gives them grants to come in and help write these reports.
[01:15:48.927 --> 01:15:57.514]  What I'm saying is the public ADL reports mirror the MYAC, the Homeland Security, the secret now published Pennsylvania reports.
[01:15:57.955 --> 01:15:59.576]  And so, what is Israel?
[01:15:59.596 --> 01:16:02.238]  I mean, if England was doing this, if China was doing it, we'd be angry.
[01:16:02.678 --> 01:16:07.623]  Why is the federal government and the state government contracting with Israeli groups
[01:16:08.243 --> 01:16:09.725]  To spy on American citizens?
[01:16:09.745 --> 01:16:15.533]  Well, the answer is to chill political speech, and I think there should be congressional hearings about this.
[01:16:16.771 --> 01:16:19.974]  I agree with you a hundred percent.
[01:16:20.014 --> 01:16:24.898]  First of all, I mean, let no one be mistaken in what they're hearing.
[01:16:25.278 --> 01:16:35.667]  If this was an American-owned company that was doing the same exact thing, it would be a violation of our rights, a violation of our trust, an abuse of power.
[01:16:36.007 --> 01:16:37.508]  I mean, it would be outrageous.
[01:16:37.568 --> 01:16:38.669]  And classic tyranny.
[01:16:38.890 --> 01:16:40.431]  Classic, classic tyranny.
[01:16:41.167 --> 01:16:42.507]  Oh, and that's exactly right.
[01:16:42.587 --> 01:16:43.348]  It's tyrannical.
[01:16:43.468 --> 01:17:03.592]  And then when you involve a foreign-owned company in this type of tyrannical behavior, it really gives that eerie feeling of a mercenary-type approach to hiring mercenaries in to actually try and intimidate and push your citizens back into a corner.
[01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:05.632]  Well, let me expand, Representative Metcalf.
[01:17:05.712 --> 01:17:07.773]  If you're at a computer or when you get out of your car,
[01:17:08.693 --> 01:17:12.116]  Type in NLE, National Level Exercise 09.
[01:17:13.457 --> 01:17:27.907]  You will read from FEMA.gov that 14 countries, including Israel, but British and others, were involved in a homeland security drill of tracking domestic extremists in a simulated war with the American people.
[01:17:27.967 --> 01:17:30.649]  So, we know this is going on.
[01:17:30.689 --> 01:17:34.392]  I've been covering this specifically for more than 13 years or so.
[01:17:34.412 --> 01:17:35.213]  I've been on air 15.
[01:17:35.473 --> 01:17:36.153]  But we know
[01:17:36.894 --> 01:17:44.777]  I mean, I have Washington Post articles where they've signed North American Union agreements to use Mexican and Canadian troops to, quote, deal with American terrorists.
[01:17:45.137 --> 01:17:52.880]  And then we have the Homeland Security reports where they say the number one enemy is returning veterans, Christians, gun owners, people that want to end the Federal Reserve.
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:54.921]  I mean, this is really happening.
[01:17:55.361 --> 01:18:00.263]  And our brigade Homeland, Army Times reports, is being trained by Israelis.
[01:18:01.003 --> 01:18:03.744]  I mean, you could really expose this with these hearings.
[01:18:03.964 --> 01:18:05.005]  When are these hearings coming up?
[01:18:06.493 --> 01:18:09.836]  The Senate hearings are going to start on Monday, this coming Monday.
[01:18:10.416 --> 01:18:12.598]  And as I said, I'm a member of the Pennsylvania House.
[01:18:12.798 --> 01:18:13.999]  It's not going to be a hearing of the House.
[01:18:14.019 --> 01:18:15.059]  It's not a joint hearing.
[01:18:15.079 --> 01:18:19.322]  It's just a hearing of one of the standing committees from the Pennsylvania Senate.
[01:18:19.823 --> 01:18:24.586]  But it's a beginning to try and get to the bottom of this and try and gather more information.
[01:18:24.626 --> 01:18:28.569]  I've sent my own request to the Director of Homeland Security.
[01:18:29.670 --> 01:18:32.792]  Subsequently, it looks like filing up here with some right-to-know requests.
[01:18:33.152 --> 01:18:33.272]  No!
[01:18:57.014 --> 01:19:08.878]  Now reportedly with this Israeli foreign group, the Pittsburgh Papers are reporting, that they were involved in law enforcement wiretapping anti-G20 groups.
[01:19:09.639 --> 01:19:15.701]  So I think the point you raise about were you being wiretapped, your Second Amendment group, I think that is very important.
[01:19:16.667 --> 01:19:26.753]  I agree, and we have individuals involved in our Second Amendment coalition from Second Amendment groups, sportsmen's groups that are across Pennsylvania from east to west, north to south.
[01:19:27.093 --> 01:19:39.420]  We have thousands, tens of thousands of Pennsylvanians that are represented by the groups that are involved with our coalition that's been the catalyst for our Second Amendment rallies that we've held now five years in a row.
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:43.882]  And we started these to try and stave off the attacks by the liberal gun-grabbing
[01:19:46.061 --> 01:19:53.245]  Governor that we have that came out of Philadelphia, Ed Rendell, and we were very successful with it.
[01:19:53.265 --> 01:20:02.710]  My work to try and bring an end to the illegal alien invasion, working with state legislators for LegalImmigration.com, Senator Pierce from Arizona, and many others, we actually were noted.
[01:20:03.490 --> 01:20:10.494]  Our work as state legislators for Legal Immigration in the Invasion PA report that put together was noted in a UN report back in early 2008, and that kind of
[01:20:13.015 --> 01:20:13.595]  We're good to go.
[01:20:34.526 --> 01:20:44.897]  Back on our heels from standing up for the rights of Americans, for standing up for our nation, but that we have individuals who have been contracted out of country by our own government to do the same?
[01:20:45.097 --> 01:20:45.758]  It's an outrage.
[01:20:46.923 --> 01:20:51.068]  Well, Representative Metcalfe, we know why they're contracting with the U.N.
[01:20:51.088 --> 01:20:52.369]  and the Israelis and others.
[01:20:53.170 --> 01:21:06.766]  Because many police are refusing to break the law and to spy on citizens without warrants, to spy on mainline, nonviolent groups that
[01:21:07.347 --> 01:21:09.668]  Represent the majority of Americans on top of it.
[01:21:09.708 --> 01:21:12.128]  I mean, over 70% in major polls are pro-Second Amendment.
[01:21:12.569 --> 01:21:15.529]  Over 70% in Gallup polls want to completely shut down the border.
[01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:23.772]  So, here they are trying to intimidate mainline dissent that's also constitutional and non-violent.
[01:21:24.192 --> 01:21:27.873]  Of course they're having to contract with foreign groups to do this.
[01:21:28.851 --> 01:21:38.198]  Well, that's what every one of our military personnel takes to note to uphold and defend our Constitution and our local elected to state elected.
[01:21:38.238 --> 01:21:42.822]  Our law enforcement certainly has the same responsibilities.
[01:21:42.842 --> 01:21:54.471]  The majority of our law enforcement, the majority of our military are patriotic citizens serving their neighbors and can't be corrupted by the tyrannical hands that would like to move them in this direction.
[01:21:55.091 --> 01:21:57.273]  Representative Metcalfe, I want to ask you a few more questions.
[01:21:57.293 --> 01:22:01.156]  We've only got about eight minutes left with you and we appreciate the time here today.
[01:22:02.076 --> 01:22:12.084]  But pulling back from this and looking at the big wide spectrum of what's going on, what is happening to you is happening everywhere.
[01:22:12.104 --> 01:22:14.006]  I know it's happening here in Austin.
[01:22:14.026 --> 01:22:17.088]  I know there's Israeli groups and others spying on citizens.
[01:22:18.089 --> 01:22:22.793]  I know that Ron Paul came out in the news and tea parties have been spied on by the army.
[01:22:23.433 --> 01:22:40.282]  The Army leaked yours truly and others this stuff back in 2008 when our in the Fed rallies had the Army at them and the Army report said don't let them know your Army they may attack you and and of course the Army personnel were so upset by this they leaked the information to myself and others.
[01:22:41.142 --> 01:22:44.765]  But this is outrageous, and police and military and others need to know.
[01:22:45.265 --> 01:22:56.912]  When you've got foreigners of the UN or the Israelis or anybody else telling you to spy on American citizens, you have a duty, I think, to go public, not just leak the information.
[01:22:57.153 --> 01:23:03.377]  Because this is a crime, and I'm really pleased to see major Pennsylvania papers talking about this being illegal.
[01:23:04.217 --> 01:23:04.597]  Right, right.
[01:23:05.278 --> 01:23:05.778]  I agree with you.
[01:23:07.574 --> 01:23:20.001]  That's the only way that we're going to defeat this type of activity and protect American lives, liberty, and properties of American citizens standing up, whether they're in the military or whether they're in law enforcement, or if they're average citizens that are being targeted by this type of activity.
[01:23:20.481 --> 01:23:22.422]  People need to stand up and speak out and not be intimidated.
[01:23:22.662 --> 01:23:33.150]  Well, after all the United States has done for Israel, why do you think Israel's so happy to have the ADL demonizing gun groups and Lou Dobbs and myself?
[01:23:33.190 --> 01:23:36.973]  Why do you think that there's other Israeli groups running around spying on you?
[01:23:37.013 --> 01:23:38.013]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[01:23:38.814 --> 01:23:40.895]  Well, that was one of my first
[01:23:41.949 --> 01:23:59.043]  Thoughts was, you know, as an American citizen, as a former soldier, as one who has been very supportive of standing with Israel against the attacks that they have endured by terrorists in their area of the world.
[01:23:59.464 --> 01:24:08.571]  That, you know, how is it that they would be linked into this type of an activity, or people from Israel being linked into this type of activity, that is targeting
[01:24:09.472 --> 01:24:13.813]  You know, the majority of the very people that have been supportive of Israel over the years.
[01:24:14.654 --> 01:24:15.414]  It's a question.
[01:24:16.594 --> 01:24:21.716]  Well, it's outrageous and I'm glad you've got the courage to criticize it.
[01:24:22.276 --> 01:24:27.738]  But, I mean, we can't... More and more we see mercenaries being used domestically, foreign groups.
[01:24:28.138 --> 01:24:31.339]  This is not the mark of a society going into more liberty.
[01:24:31.719 --> 01:24:36.180]  It's the sure sign of a society degrading into despotism.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:38.261]  That's exactly right.
[01:24:39.508 --> 01:24:52.378]  That's what the American people have to understand, have to grasp, have to get hold of before they become like that frog that's solely cooked in that ever-increasing temperature of the pot that you're in.
[01:24:53.158 --> 01:25:00.764]  We have to recognize, in order to hold on to America, to hold on to the freedoms that we cherish, to hold on to those God-given liberties that are affirmed in our Constitution.
[01:25:01.384 --> 01:25:15.058]  We're going to have to be vigilant, we're going to have to be very vocal and very active in standing up to our government to ensure that our government understands you weren't elected to be a master, you were elected to be a servant.
[01:25:15.118 --> 01:25:19.603]  Now get into your servant's role, serve us, protect our freedom, and stop screwing with us.
[01:25:20.151 --> 01:25:24.616]  Well, Representative, I know a lot of police come up and shake my hand all over the country.
[01:25:24.997 --> 01:25:26.278]  They're good men and women.
[01:25:26.679 --> 01:25:30.804]  But just yesterday, I saw in a neighborhood a warrantless checkpoint.
[01:25:31.264 --> 01:25:35.329]  I pulled over on a side street, got out, politely walked over to the state police.
[01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:38.652]  And I said, hey, troopers, what's going on out here?
[01:25:39.152 --> 01:25:41.173]  And they just said, none of your business.
[01:25:41.213 --> 01:25:42.133]  I mean, screamed at me.
[01:25:42.694 --> 01:25:45.856]  This one guy bared his teeth and said, get back in your car and leave.
[01:25:45.876 --> 01:25:48.557]  And it wasn't an arrest going on, nothing happening.
[01:25:48.577 --> 01:25:51.519]  They were just all out there setting up a checkpoint, putting up a tent.
[01:25:52.319 --> 01:25:53.281]  Blocking part of the road.
[01:26:10.163 --> 01:26:13.185]  And I didn't argue with him, I just said, man, you're really treating me bad.
[01:26:13.205 --> 01:26:20.809]  And, you know, more and more there's this attitude of we work for the government and we shouldn't ask the government any questions.
[01:26:21.210 --> 01:26:25.132]  And as Thomas Jefferson said, when the people are afraid of the government, you have tyranny.
[01:26:25.152 --> 01:26:26.793]  When the government's afraid of the people, we have liberty.
[01:26:27.553 --> 01:26:28.454]  That's exactly right.
[01:26:28.814 --> 01:26:38.620]  And, you know, as you mentioned, the majority of our law enforcement are good men and women who are interested in serving their fellow citizens.
[01:26:39.884 --> 01:26:50.769]  But as with anything, whether it's your politicians, your ballplayers, law enforcement, wherever you find yourself working, there's always someone that's going to be in that position that's going to allow the power to go to their head.
[01:26:51.129 --> 01:26:52.329]  Yeah, well, that was the issue.
[01:26:52.410 --> 01:26:54.710]  I mean, I said, what's your name, Trooper?
[01:26:55.011 --> 01:26:57.332]  And he said, it's Sergeant Baker to you!
[01:26:57.892 --> 01:27:01.793]  And the other ones were kind of looking and smiling or, you know, looked uncomfortable.
[01:27:01.813 --> 01:27:04.795]  Because I literally walked up in a charming way and talked to him.
[01:27:05.715 --> 01:27:08.119]  And in fact, I hadn't even gotten near him.
[01:27:08.159 --> 01:27:17.992]  He came over to me and I was real polite and I was about 20 feet from the other troopers and he just went crazy on me like I was his slave or something.
[01:27:18.813 --> 01:27:18.973]  Right.
[01:27:19.571 --> 01:27:30.355]  Well, it's important for our citizenry to support our law enforcement, support our military, but at the same time to make sure that they stand with the majority of those folks.
[01:27:30.735 --> 01:27:31.795]  Yeah, yeah, they shouldn't actually.
[01:27:31.835 --> 01:27:39.598]  And not be intimidated by the unlawful actions or unconstitutional actions of those that are in office or those that are in the bureaucracy that are violating the Constitution or violating the law.
[01:27:39.918 --> 01:27:40.659]  Well, exactly.
[01:27:40.759 --> 01:27:44.501]  I mean, he was acting like cops I've seen in third-world police states.
[01:27:44.521 --> 01:27:46.063]  I mean, we know what tyranny looks like.
[01:27:46.523 --> 01:27:47.444]  We know how it walks.
[01:27:47.484 --> 01:27:48.424]  We know how it quacks.
[01:27:49.205 --> 01:27:52.647]  And it's just scary, but we know why it's happening.
[01:27:53.348 --> 01:27:55.710]  Most of the homeland security training, over 90%, is for
[01:27:57.671 --> 01:28:00.493]  Mr. Metcalf, Representative Metcalf, it's for Alex Jones.
[01:28:00.994 --> 01:28:03.936]  And I think people better understand that this was bipartisan.
[01:28:04.236 --> 01:28:08.640]  These reports that we saw under Obama, sir, I can send you the reports that were issued under Bush.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:15.465]  He obviously didn't issue them himself, but the bureaucracy at the top sees the American people as the enemy.
[01:28:17.867 --> 01:28:21.668]  Well, I think that's a very good point.
[01:28:21.688 --> 01:28:40.095]  I think it's one that people have to take to heart, one that people have to recognize, so that when they're exercising their right to vote on November 2nd, when they're carrying out and going through their lives, they understand that you can't let your elected official just be elected on November 2nd and have a free ride the next two years or four years or six years, whatever that term of office is.
[01:28:40.155 --> 01:28:41.936]  We need American citizens to step forward.
[01:28:42.356 --> 01:28:42.757]  I think so.
[01:28:53.116 --> 01:28:53.776]  Absolutely.
[01:28:53.816 --> 01:28:56.377]  They are the servants, and they're out of control on every front.
[01:28:56.397 --> 01:29:01.138]  And they've been given a green light to go wild, and that's what's fueling this massive political awakening.
[01:29:01.879 --> 01:29:11.421]  In closing, I'd like to get you back on after the hearings, and I hope that you will call for serious criminal investigations, and I hope people realize this is going on everywhere.
[01:29:11.861 --> 01:29:19.283]  And by shining a lot of truth on this... Well, I mean, in closing, the news reports the head of Homeland Security in your state is hiding.
[01:29:19.504 --> 01:29:20.524]  Do we know where he is?
[01:29:22.823 --> 01:29:23.364]  I do not.
[01:29:23.584 --> 01:29:29.465]  I know we sent a letter to the address that he's supposed to be working at, that he's supposed to be employed at.
[01:29:30.005 --> 01:29:32.906]  We'll be following up on that letter, as I said, with a right-to-know request.
[01:29:33.426 --> 01:29:42.048]  And hopefully the hearings on Monday will help to find more information that we're seeking in order to determine exactly what did they do with this information.
[01:29:42.528 --> 01:29:45.669]  How many law-abiding Pennsylvanians have come under the scrutiny?
[01:29:45.969 --> 01:29:47.990]  Stay there, stay there, stay there, stay there, sir.
[01:29:49.912 --> 01:29:52.893]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.833 --> 01:29:56.573]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.374 --> 01:30:00.614]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:00.634 --> 01:30:03.795]  Remember when I said you spell freedom F-O-O-D?
[01:30:03.975 --> 01:30:04.675]  It's really true.
[01:30:04.955 --> 01:30:08.816]  Legislation is in the process of restricting the growing and sharing of food.
[01:30:09.116 --> 01:30:14.317]  And a record number of Americans, over 43 million, depend on the government to feed themselves.
[01:30:14.577 --> 01:30:16.438]  Food prices are going up for Americans.
[01:30:16.638 --> 01:30:19.859]  Prices are going up even for eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:30:20.059 --> 01:30:23.300]  This will require their first price increase in three years.
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:34.823]  The most important thing Americans can do for their own freedom and survival in these hardest of times is to get supplies of high quality storable food because of the huge response to this buy three and get one free special.
[01:30:35.183 --> 01:30:39.064]  eFoodsDirect.com will continue this special until September 27th.
[01:30:39.364 --> 01:30:45.286]  Right now you can buy three and get one free at the old prices, but move fast because this offer ends September 27th.
[01:30:45.306 --> 01:30:47.907]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:30:47.927 --> 01:30:51.949]  That's 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:31:03.334 --> 01:31:04.255]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:04.595 --> 01:31:08.178]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:08.479 --> 01:31:10.741]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:10.761 --> 01:31:16.206]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:16.626 --> 01:31:22.872]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:23.292 --> 01:31:28.833]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:29.273 --> 01:31:32.934]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:37.435]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:37.735 --> 01:31:43.276]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:43.676 --> 01:31:46.636]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:47.236 --> 01:31:48.657]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:49.197 --> 01:31:49.637]  It's here.

[01:31:59.843 --> 01:32:14.331]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:32:15.332 --> 01:32:18.994]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:32.010]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:32:32.771 --> 01:32:40.036]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:32:40.717 --> 01:32:50.320]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:54.361]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:32:55.021 --> 01:32:58.122]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:33:01.403 --> 01:33:04.385]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:04.965 --> 01:33:09.188]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:09.548 --> 01:33:22.857]  All right, Representative Daryl Metcalf of Pennsylvania runs a mainline Second Amendment group targeted by basically Israeli Mossad front group with the state and the feds of course directing the whole situation.
[01:33:23.237 --> 01:33:24.038]  It's all illegal.
[01:33:24.798 --> 01:33:27.061]  They're in hiding, hoping this all blows over.
[01:33:27.482 --> 01:33:30.025]  His website is repmetcalf.com.
[01:33:30.045 --> 01:33:37.035]  You can also go to statelegislatures4legalimmigration.com, a group that he helps head up.
[01:33:37.756 --> 01:33:39.038]  You got cut off by the brick, sir.
[01:33:39.058 --> 01:33:41.241]  I wanted you to be able to finish your statements.
[01:33:43.117 --> 01:34:00.827]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex, but we're going to continue to try and dig to the bottom of this, find out what's happened, find out what type of surveillance was taking place on myself and others that have been associated with me and working on trying to stand up for the freedom that we enjoy as American citizens.
[01:34:00.927 --> 01:34:09.211]  And you are the elected representative, so Homeland Security bureaucracy had better not try to keep the legislature from finding out what they're doing.
[01:34:09.431 --> 01:34:10.252]  That's the problem.
[01:34:10.332 --> 01:34:12.293]  This is a state agency doing this.
[01:34:12.841 --> 01:34:13.762]  That's exactly right.
[01:34:13.782 --> 01:34:14.603]  That's exactly right.
[01:34:15.104 --> 01:34:16.266]  We are the voice of the people.
[01:34:16.306 --> 01:34:17.608]  We've been elected to serve the people.
[01:34:18.088 --> 01:34:20.391]  And we're going to work to try and find out what's happened here.
[01:34:21.533 --> 01:34:23.636]  In closing, any other points you wanted to make?
[01:34:24.717 --> 01:34:27.041]  And some of the other groups they were spying on as well?
[01:34:27.964 --> 01:34:34.470]  I think it's important for all of your listeners to become more actively involved in their government.
[01:34:35.171 --> 01:34:39.395]  We do not have enough citizens that are actively involved in holding our elected officials accountable.
[01:34:39.415 --> 01:34:43.398]  If we did have, we wouldn't have this kind of out-of-control bureaucracy taking place.
[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:48.503]  Absolutely, and this is across the political spectrum.
[01:34:50.876 --> 01:35:12.459]  are involved in lobbying for anything I mean such a mainline groups left right libertarian religious I mean this group was spying on everybody and it wasn't even the state doing it because they clearly couldn't get their own people to break the law they hired a foreign group probably a Mossad operators to do it this is incredible that that's exactly right so when you when you have a
[01:35:24.996 --> 01:35:28.097]  Well, we better pull up the floorboards and see what's buried under there.
[01:35:28.277 --> 01:35:33.380]  It certainly stinks and it's going to get a lot worse from here, but it's going to get better in the end.
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:36.222]  Thanks to people like you out there, Representative Metcalf.
[01:35:36.262 --> 01:35:41.705]  God bless you and I look forward to getting you on next week from a landline after you've had these hearings.
[01:35:42.449 --> 01:35:42.909]  Sounds good, Alex.
[01:35:42.949 --> 01:35:43.509]  Have a great day.
[01:35:43.670 --> 01:35:44.310]  Thank you so much.
[01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.950]  God bless you.
[01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:47.991]  Folks, pray for him and others and for the courage he's got.
[01:35:48.692 --> 01:35:49.932]  This is just outrageous.
[01:35:50.212 --> 01:35:54.514]  And the ADL has said that I'm the number one enemy.
[01:35:55.795 --> 01:35:56.455]  And you know why?
[01:35:56.475 --> 01:36:03.738]  Because I expose the Feds are running the white supremacist groups, that they then try to tie into patriot groups to demonize anybody who's for the Constitution.
[01:36:05.299 --> 01:36:09.161]  And that's something that, you know, that information
[01:36:10.114 --> 01:36:26.842]  That the federal government has been caught in other groups over and over again funding white supremacists, funding other organizations, to then scare the left and scare Jews and others into supporting tyranny and homeland security so they can get their donations.
[01:36:29.093 --> 01:36:32.054]  This is a full spectrum dominance operation.
[01:36:32.154 --> 01:36:34.515]  I told you Hal Turner a decade ago was a Fed.
[01:36:34.896 --> 01:36:38.577]  It's admitted high-level national security asset of the FBI.
[01:36:39.337 --> 01:36:44.460]  Why do you think that within two hours in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
[01:36:45.421 --> 01:36:50.283]  With that three dead cops that the media was saying the guy did it because he liked Alex Jones.
[01:36:50.703 --> 01:36:52.003]  We searched the guy's name.
[01:36:52.324 --> 01:36:54.745]  There he was on my own message board attacking us.
[01:36:55.285 --> 01:36:57.966]  There he was saying I was bad for years.
[01:36:58.586 --> 01:37:01.887]  They lied and said that to try to sic police on us.
[01:37:03.628 --> 01:37:05.569]  Why does the ADL hate me so much?
[01:37:06.269 --> 01:37:11.651]  Because I'm not anti-semitic and I don't fight the New World Order from that position.
[01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:21.857]  The media wants to make it all about bashing Jews so that it's politically divisive and destructive.
[01:37:21.897 --> 01:37:29.944]  And that's why all of the major white supremacist organizations that the media gives attention to are even calling for my death.
[01:37:31.265 --> 01:37:34.648]  And they're doing that because they work for the feds.
[01:37:36.144 --> 01:37:43.487]  And many of these people then have camp followers who are not feds but are weak-minded who then buy into lies.
[01:37:43.527 --> 01:37:47.729]  I got sent this morning a clip where somebody was saying I supported the Israeli attack on the flotilla.
[01:37:47.769 --> 01:37:51.291]  I was totally against that and said it was wrong and tried to avert further things.
[01:37:51.331 --> 01:37:52.391]  It's just, it's lies.
[01:37:53.131 --> 01:37:56.673]  It's lies about what I stand for, lies about what I do, and I've noticed
[01:37:57.714 --> 01:38:06.281]  I get this feedback, hey, go after Israel more, and when I do, because the evidence is there, I get attacked by these groups even more.
[01:38:06.461 --> 01:38:08.002]  What's going on there?
[01:38:08.983 --> 01:38:10.044]  What's happening there?
[01:38:10.604 --> 01:38:12.786]  I got this representative on to expose this.
[01:38:12.826 --> 01:38:14.027]  I'm going to get him on next week.
[01:38:14.867 --> 01:38:16.749]  We've been reporting on this from day one.
[01:38:17.409 --> 01:38:19.851]  Pennsylvania is a hotbed of this.
[01:38:20.111 --> 01:38:21.452]  One of my reporters was arrested.
[01:38:21.853 --> 01:38:25.195]  The police came to them and said, we think you wanted to blow up a military base.
[01:38:25.555 --> 01:38:27.177]  You're in terrorist databases now.
[01:38:28.922 --> 01:38:36.103]  Rob Dew was there at a military base, it was military and police at an old armory, with people coming off trucks with hoods on their heads.
[01:38:36.504 --> 01:38:49.206]  There were groups there snatching and grabbing citizens and forcing them into cars, unmarked cars, and it came out that it wasn't the army, even though they were wearing army uniforms, National Guard uniforms, that it was quote private contractors for the G20.
[01:38:49.546 --> 01:38:57.488]  A foreign multinational consortium of central bank heads comes to the United States, same thing in Canada a few months ago,
[01:38:58.692 --> 01:39:06.259]  And in front of news cameras, they jump out of unmarked cars and vans, grab citizens, and drag them into vehicles.
[01:39:06.299 --> 01:39:17.870]  In fact, YouTube, Snatch and Grab, G20 Canada, Toronto, Snatch and Grab, G20, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we can show quick clips of that for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:20.592]  We're not just radio folks, we're TV at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:24.025 --> 01:39:25.586]  Because they want to scare you.
[01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:29.488]  They want you to think if you go out to a demonstration, sound cannons are going to blast you.
[01:39:30.188 --> 01:39:34.590]  They want you to think that you're going to be snatched off the street and thrown into a truck and driven away.
[01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:38.712]  They hire provocateurs, admitted in Denver, Denver Post, 2008.
[01:39:40.052 --> 01:39:42.293]  We said it looked like cops, but we couldn't prove it.
[01:39:42.654 --> 01:39:46.475]  Turned out it was cops dressed up as anarchists attacking their own people.
[01:39:46.916 --> 01:39:51.958]  Same thing in Montebello, or Monticello, excuse me, up in Canada three years ago.
[01:39:53.462 --> 01:39:56.523]  And here's the snatch-and-grab footage right now.
[01:39:57.564 --> 01:39:59.145]  This is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[01:39:59.725 --> 01:40:04.807]  Men jumping out in military uniforms, dragging an innocent person into a vehicle.
[01:40:04.847 --> 01:40:08.849]  And it turned out those were private contractors, probably for this Israeli company.
[01:40:09.949 --> 01:40:12.490]  It's admitted they were the main commanders of the operation.
[01:40:12.831 --> 01:40:14.251]  We don't know if that was their people there.
[01:40:15.092 --> 01:40:17.152]  So this is America.
[01:40:17.172 --> 01:40:18.193]  Now you can pull up the Canada.
[01:40:19.713 --> 01:40:25.237]  Snatch and grab or private security grabs people off the streets at G20.
[01:40:25.257 --> 01:40:27.818]  That'll pull it up for you in Canada.
[01:40:28.819 --> 01:40:30.120]  It doesn't matter if it's England.
[01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:31.120]  It doesn't matter if it's Canada.
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:32.481]  It doesn't matter if it's the United States.
[01:40:32.501 --> 01:40:33.662]  It doesn't matter if it's Italy.
[01:40:33.722 --> 01:40:36.204]  When they have these events, the same thing is done.
[01:40:36.284 --> 01:40:37.124]  It's global.
[01:40:38.185 --> 01:40:38.966]  It's global.
[01:40:39.766 --> 01:40:40.967]  They hire provocateurs.
[01:40:41.267 --> 01:40:43.569]  They hire white supremacists to demonize
[01:40:44.975 --> 01:40:48.200]  They hire cops to attack their own police and demonize demonstrations.
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:52.606]  And that's why as the public gets angrier and angrier, there's still smaller and smaller protests.
[01:40:52.767 --> 01:40:55.531]  Because now you brave microwave guns, sound cannons.
[01:40:55.791 --> 01:40:59.237]  You have to go through literal Hades on Earth.
[01:41:02.165 --> 01:41:06.207]  Bob Chapman talked about 30 years ago being harassed by Mossad for no reason.
[01:41:06.267 --> 01:41:08.308]  He wasn't even bashing Israel at the time.
[01:41:08.688 --> 01:41:10.229]  He wasn't even getting into those issues.
[01:41:10.449 --> 01:41:11.730]  He was anti-Fellow Reserve.
[01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:14.411]  But see, they want you to hate them.
[01:41:14.471 --> 01:41:18.994]  They want you to come out so that they can then have that fight go on.
[01:41:19.254 --> 01:41:21.455]  And they think the general public won't know what's happening.
[01:41:21.935 --> 01:41:24.477]  It's very, very scary, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:25.677 --> 01:41:30.300]  Very, very scary to have all of this going on.
[01:41:31.851 --> 01:41:32.555]  And, um...
[01:41:35.717 --> 01:41:39.018]  It's just intensifying, and that's why we need your prayers.
[01:41:39.458 --> 01:41:40.759]  That's why we need your support.
[01:41:41.359 --> 01:41:44.540]  Because if I'm going to do this, if I'm going to put it all on the line, I want to win.
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:45.600]  And I know we can win.
[01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:46.700]  I know America's good.
[01:41:47.361 --> 01:41:55.043]  I know the American people are good, whether they're Catholic, or Protestant, or Jewish, or Muslim, or whatever the case is.
[01:41:55.883 --> 01:41:57.244]  I know you want freedom.
[01:41:57.464 --> 01:41:58.804]  I know you want liberty.
[01:41:58.944 --> 01:42:00.104]  I know you're good people.
[01:42:00.465 --> 01:42:01.825]  I know most of the police are good.
[01:42:04.821 --> 01:42:16.614]  I know that you want a better life for your family and, you know, I had a historian on, head of his political science department, uh, you know, even mainstream news says that one of the top experts in the world on communist China.
[01:42:18.415 --> 01:42:20.578]  And he agreed with me that we're going into tyranny here.
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:24.342]  He agreed that this is happening worldwide.
[01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:29.902]  This is really going on, and it's going to affect the enforcers.
[01:42:30.042 --> 01:42:31.603]  You are the group in the greatest danger.
[01:42:31.963 --> 01:42:36.566]  Those of you that carry this out, remember people being ordered to torture under the White House memos to the Pentagon?
[01:42:36.846 --> 01:42:37.266]  Confirmed.
[01:42:37.306 --> 01:42:42.409]  John Yoo, Alberto Gonzalez, George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, the minutes of the meetings, ordering the torture.
[01:42:42.670 --> 01:42:43.990]  Pentagon saying, we don't want to do this.
[01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:46.632]  We're not going to be able to complain when our people get tortured in the future.
[01:42:46.912 --> 01:42:52.175]  It'll destroy them around the military, and it will be a horrible PR problem, and it's illegal.
[01:42:52.315 --> 01:42:53.296]  And they said, you do it.
[01:42:54.378 --> 01:42:55.580]  Not to stop terrorists.
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:56.761]  They fund the real terrorists.
[01:42:56.841 --> 01:42:57.743]  They fund those groups.
[01:42:58.023 --> 01:42:58.564]  It's on record.
[01:43:00.126 --> 01:43:01.067]  To create terror.
[01:43:01.127 --> 01:43:02.229]  To create fear.
[01:43:02.589 --> 01:43:04.612]  And to set the precedent for torture.
[01:43:05.799 --> 01:43:08.340]  And then Bush comes out three months ago and says, yeah, I ordered torture.
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:09.080]  I'd do it again.
[01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:13.341]  Well, there are scores of people in prison, private contractors and U.S.
[01:43:13.381 --> 01:43:16.722]  military, who carried out the torture as ordered.
[01:43:16.782 --> 01:43:18.142]  And I'm not saying they shouldn't go to prison.
[01:43:18.162 --> 01:43:18.582]  They should.
[01:43:18.842 --> 01:43:22.123]  But the biggest prison sentences should be for those that ordered it.
[01:43:22.463 --> 01:43:25.384]  These people are in prison for following orders.
[01:43:25.744 --> 01:43:28.945]  And meanwhile, Bush is admitting he ordered torture.
[01:43:29.525 --> 01:43:31.846]  And Glenn Beck is saying Jack Bauer's a hero.
[01:43:32.066 --> 01:43:32.986]  We need more torture.
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.343]  Now, maybe he should apologize for that.
[01:43:35.644 --> 01:43:40.594]  You know, if Beck would apologize for all this stuff he's promoted... Look, you can't be the good guys and promote torture.
[01:43:41.997 --> 01:43:43.840]  But you're put in a psychological position...
[01:43:45.401 --> 01:43:47.662]  Where you're put into fear, so you'll go along with this.
[01:43:47.682 --> 01:43:49.163]  But the good news is they had a Gallup poll.
[01:43:49.883 --> 01:43:52.084]  Was it a Gallup or was it a Scripps Howard News Service?
[01:43:52.665 --> 01:43:56.026]  Well, you guys searched the term national poll.
[01:43:56.787 --> 01:44:01.990]  Only 1% of Americans think terrorism is the most important issue or is an important issue.
[01:44:02.490 --> 01:44:04.431]  Only 1% think terror is the most important issue.
[01:44:04.951 --> 01:44:06.352]  And it was 40, what was it?
[01:44:07.032 --> 01:44:08.233]  4% just a few years ago?
[01:44:08.533 --> 01:44:09.833]  We'll pull it up and see if my memory serves.
[01:44:10.233 --> 01:44:17.016]  I know it was 1%, I think it was 44 or 46 just two years ago, in the same poll they do every year, thought it was the number one issue.
[01:44:17.896 --> 01:44:18.817]  Gallup poll, I was right.
[01:44:19.537 --> 01:44:20.638]  Let's put it on screen then, please.
[01:44:22.638 --> 01:44:29.501]  I'm just showing you, people hear me rattle all this off and think I'm just making it up because, you know, nobody can just rattle off all these statistics, numbers, and facts.
[01:44:30.682 --> 01:44:31.922]  But I do the research.
[01:44:31.942 --> 01:44:32.982]  I mean, this is what I do.
[01:44:33.042 --> 01:44:34.023]  This is how I live.
[01:44:35.410 --> 01:44:45.412]  And the globalists are trying to radicalize the patriot movement to make it fail, and to make it be limited, and to make it not have a big tent for everybody.
[01:44:47.592 --> 01:44:49.613]  Divide and conquer is the program.
[01:44:50.953 --> 01:44:55.374]  And it's sad and it's hurtful.
[01:44:55.394 --> 01:44:56.514]  Now there it is.
[01:44:56.594 --> 01:44:56.894]  Poll.
[01:44:57.114 --> 01:44:59.934]  1% see terrorism as top problem.
[01:45:01.315 --> 01:45:01.915]  And it says 46%
[01:45:06.274 --> 01:45:07.977]  Previously thought it was the top issue.
[01:45:08.959 --> 01:45:09.780]  Right after 9-11.
[01:45:10.281 --> 01:45:13.547]  I think later it reports similar numbers just a few years ago, so I was correct.
[01:45:13.627 --> 01:45:13.828]  Okay.
[01:45:15.151 --> 01:45:15.771]  Memory serves.
[01:45:16.372 --> 01:45:29.381]  Before I go any further and get into a bunch of other economic news, police state news, media shake-up news, Globalist openly announcing again their One World Government currency news, I want to just remind listeners that we're listener-supported.
[01:45:29.641 --> 01:45:31.022]  We don't have News Corp behind us.
[01:45:31.082 --> 01:45:32.703]  We don't have big tax-free foundations.
[01:45:33.023 --> 01:45:44.871]  We don't have the tens of billions a year, and that's just what we know about, of propaganda placement where the federal government takes your tax money and gives it to CNN, NBC, Fox, all of them.
[01:45:46.291 --> 01:45:47.873]  Remember I'd tell you about that over a decade ago?
[01:45:49.414 --> 01:45:56.661]  I first learned about it because I'd hear local radio stations promoting, in one case, this is actually 14 years ago, Austin Air Force.
[01:45:57.862 --> 01:45:59.904]  Austin Air Force isn't the military.
[01:46:00.325 --> 01:46:10.695]  It was a government-funded, federally-funded, slash UN-funded group, preparing everyone for carbon taxes and for increased emissions cost.
[01:46:11.633 --> 01:46:13.694]  And they also want tracker boxes in your cars.
[01:46:13.774 --> 01:46:15.135]  Now they're openly announcing that.
[01:46:15.615 --> 01:46:20.378]  So I heard in the news it being promoted that they were at different gas stations.
[01:46:20.398 --> 01:46:22.539]  So I got in a car with Mike Hanson.
[01:46:22.559 --> 01:46:23.560]  In fact, he has this video.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:24.981]  If he can dig it out, he can put it on YouTube.
[01:46:25.221 --> 01:46:26.662]  The hundreds of great reports we filed.
[01:46:28.541 --> 01:46:30.242]  In fact, Hanson, I know you're listening right now.
[01:46:30.262 --> 01:46:32.523]  Will you please get that up on the Mike Hanson Archives at YouTube?
[01:46:32.903 --> 01:46:33.723]  So much great stuff.
[01:46:33.743 --> 01:46:36.264]  I know he's busy, but he does a great job.
[01:46:36.284 --> 01:46:37.524]  But we need to get all that stuff out.
[01:46:37.925 --> 01:46:39.505]  And I pull up my car with Mike.
[01:46:39.585 --> 01:46:40.085]  We get out.
[01:46:40.626 --> 01:46:44.947]  We walk over, and I said, let me guess, you paid for those newscasts.
[01:46:45.007 --> 01:46:45.988]  That wasn't real news.
[01:46:46.888 --> 01:46:48.209]  And he said, yep, sure did, Alex.
[01:46:48.429 --> 01:46:49.129]  Knew who I was.
[01:46:49.349 --> 01:46:49.909]  Oh, you know who I am?
[01:46:49.929 --> 01:46:50.790]  Yeah, I know who you are.
[01:46:51.230 --> 01:46:53.811]  I said, you're here to condition people to accept carbon taxes.
[01:46:55.154 --> 01:46:58.916]  It's gotta be 12, 13, maybe, I think it was like 1997, so 13 years ago.
[01:47:00.357 --> 01:47:01.918]  And he just admitted it all on tape.
[01:47:02.118 --> 01:47:09.822]  And so I called that local station up, and I got a hold of the program director, and I said, were you paid to run that as if it was news?
[01:47:09.842 --> 01:47:12.423]  And he said, yeah, but I'm not gonna talk to you about it.
[01:47:13.664 --> 01:47:16.565]  That's how I learned that most of the news is paid for.
[01:47:17.006 --> 01:47:18.526]  None of our news is paid for.
[01:47:19.027 --> 01:47:23.429]  It's paid for by you supporting us, and by the support our sponsors bring us with no strings attached.
[01:47:25.612 --> 01:47:28.473]  We are supported by you, you alone.
[01:47:28.754 --> 01:47:37.138]  The sky's the limit of what we could do by you spreading the word about InfoWars.com, about the free podcast, upwards of 300,000 download a day, the free iPhone app.
[01:47:37.158 --> 01:47:43.681]  Even if you don't have an iPhone, send it to people that do have iPhones, so they can listen how they want, when they want, where they want.
[01:47:43.701 --> 01:47:47.043]  If you're listening to us on a local AM or FM station, support their local sponsors.
[01:47:47.123 --> 01:47:52.526]  Tell everybody, stand with a sandwich board on the street corner, and tell people to tune into that local station when I'm on.
[01:47:54.246 --> 01:47:54.927]  Tell them the times.
[01:47:56.601 --> 01:47:58.462]  Buy the books, the videos, the t-shirts.
[01:47:58.502 --> 01:48:02.904]  We've got deals where I think we make about 20% on these, almost no markup.
[01:48:02.924 --> 01:48:05.365]  Or you can buy blue and red Infowars.com pins.
[01:48:06.965 --> 01:48:09.807]  Great way to buy five, 10, 15, 20 of them in different packs.
[01:48:09.827 --> 01:48:12.228]  You can buy almost at cost.
[01:48:12.888 --> 01:48:13.328]  We make maybe 5%.
[01:48:13.548 --> 01:48:16.289]  In fact, some months we've done the math.
[01:48:16.750 --> 01:48:18.290]  We lose money on the citizen rule books.
[01:48:18.330 --> 01:48:21.572]  We put them free in all the orders, but we also sell them in bulk at cost.
[01:48:21.612 --> 01:48:23.753]  It's at cost when you start buying them at 100 or so.
[01:48:25.811 --> 01:48:28.594]  We're buying thousands of dollars of these a month just to give out free.
[01:48:30.495 --> 01:48:33.538]  It's all available at InfoWars.com.
[01:48:34.139 --> 01:48:41.526]  The pins, the citizen rulebooks that we put free with the orders, or you can buy them in bulk, and it's got InfoWars.com printed on the inside of the citizen rulebook.
[01:48:41.886 --> 01:48:42.687]  Give them to people.
[01:48:43.027 --> 01:48:43.928]  Get them out to folks.
[01:48:43.948 --> 01:48:44.669]  This is effective.
[01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:47.692]  That's why the neocons have come out with their own neocon rulebook.
[01:48:49.528 --> 01:48:50.289]  Support us.
[01:48:50.349 --> 01:48:51.970]  Spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:54.092]  The Money Bomb's coming up October 14th.
[01:48:54.132 --> 01:48:58.315]  We've had hackers publicly saying, hack our websites, attack our sites to shut us down.
[01:48:59.115 --> 01:49:00.596]  We've got death threats flowing in.
[01:49:00.636 --> 01:49:04.399]  We've got other stuff behind the scenes that I'm not at liberty to talk about because it only encourages it.
[01:49:06.201 --> 01:49:07.722]  My wife's a tough lady, folks.
[01:49:08.322 --> 01:49:10.744]  People calling up, threatening to rape her and cut her head off.
[01:49:10.804 --> 01:49:12.525]  I mean, I mean, it's, I mean, and you know what?
[01:49:13.987 --> 01:49:16.949]  If somebody wants to come to my house and die, that's their issue.
[01:49:17.850 --> 01:49:18.150]  But we,
[01:49:21.025 --> 01:49:21.925]  We defend ourselves.
[01:49:23.386 --> 01:49:24.986]  But I'm going to tell you, we're not going to stop.
[01:49:25.046 --> 01:49:30.128]  And even if they kill me or put me in prison or set me up, just keep getting my videos and material out to everybody.
[01:49:30.208 --> 01:49:32.669]  Buy the DVDs, make copies, put them on AXS TV.
[01:49:32.969 --> 01:49:36.270]  There's a reason the system is mimicking what we're doing on Fox News and twisting it.
[01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:41.111]  There's a reason the neocons are trying to pose and literally stealing all our material and twisting it.
[01:49:42.344 --> 01:49:43.645]  It's because we've got the truth.
[01:49:43.705 --> 01:49:44.606]  We've got reality.
[01:49:44.807 --> 01:49:53.955]  You know, we raised over $19,000 in the last week without even really promoting it at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, even though it officially launches October 14th.
[01:49:54.036 --> 01:49:56.138]  If you want to start giving now, that's fine.
[01:49:57.162 --> 01:49:59.463]  The hackers have sworn to shut it down on October 14th.
[01:49:59.503 --> 01:50:02.265]  We've still got phone lines, we've still got, we'll put the links up somewhere else.
[01:50:02.845 --> 01:50:05.147]  The point is, they want to stop us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:05.767 --> 01:50:09.729]  And Cass Sunstein admits they've got an army of bloggers out there attacking us and others.
[01:50:10.330 --> 01:50:18.935]  They're coming after us, Media Matters, ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, all these groups are demonizing us, lying about us, deceptively editing what I say.
[01:50:21.596 --> 01:50:29.583]  You know, there's videos out there that I've literally seen in scores of newspapers in the last week as a staged blitz saying Alex Jones says kettle chips make you gay.
[01:50:29.643 --> 01:50:30.303]  I didn't say that.
[01:50:30.984 --> 01:50:33.246]  I said bisphenol A makes men effeminate.
[01:50:34.927 --> 01:50:40.032]  And studies show then with some people that causes a proclivity towards being attracted to the same sex.
[01:50:40.072 --> 01:50:44.816]  Same thing happens with frogs when they come in contact with bisphenol A. That's on record.
[01:50:45.596 --> 01:50:49.660]  And I said kettle chips might still have MSG because it says other ingredients.
[01:50:50.848 --> 01:50:56.132]  They said, I didn't say kettle chips make you gay, but the media is saying that.
[01:50:56.392 --> 01:50:57.813]  We'll be right back with Key Intel.
[01:50:57.833 --> 01:50:58.273]  Stay with us.
[01:50:59.875 --> 01:51:01.135]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.175 --> 01:51:06.519]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:06.759 --> 01:51:11.383]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:11.783 --> 01:51:12.183]  It's true.
[01:51:12.263 --> 01:51:16.807]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:17.347 --> 01:51:22.050]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:22.571 --> 01:51:24.492]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:24.872 --> 01:51:29.495]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:29.675 --> 01:51:30.576]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:30.796 --> 01:51:33.578]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:33.878 --> 01:51:37.180]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:37.501 --> 01:51:40.342]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:40.683 --> 01:51:42.564]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:42.904 --> 01:51:43.825]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:47.467 --> 01:51:49.250]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:51.695 --> 01:51:56.222]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:56.543 --> 01:51:58.927]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:59.588 --> 01:52:01.229]  Great news for pure water lovers!
[01:52:01.369 --> 01:52:03.910]  The Big Berkey Water Filter is available once again.
[01:52:04.210 --> 01:52:07.531]  And stay tuned to hear about a valuable offer from Berkey Water Filters.
[01:52:07.751 --> 01:52:11.013]  Choosing the right water purification system can be a daunting task.

[01:52:15.674 --> 01:52:20.516]  The Berkey Water Filter is economical with a single set of filters that can last for 5 to 10 years.
[01:52:20.696 --> 01:52:24.698]  Berkey Water Filters are healthy and far superior to other filtration systems.
[01:52:24.878 --> 01:52:29.701]  They remove harmful pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and unhealthy chemicals like chlorine.
[01:52:30.021 --> 01:52:36.225]  And, Berkey water filter systems are powerful enough to purify both treated and untreated water, like stagnant ponds.

[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:52.861]  That's 1-877-99-BER-KEY.
[01:52:59.827 --> 01:53:02.749]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[01:53:02.829 --> 01:53:04.790]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[01:53:04.890 --> 01:53:07.552]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[01:53:07.652 --> 01:53:09.613]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[01:53:09.873 --> 01:53:11.054]  Okay, here it comes.
[01:53:11.294 --> 01:53:12.895]  But first, the facts.
[01:53:13.176 --> 01:53:14.917]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[01:53:15.117 --> 01:53:16.838]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[01:53:17.098 --> 01:53:20.580]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:53:20.801 --> 01:53:28.205]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:53:28.545 --> 01:53:29.166]  Sinofresh.
[01:53:29.406 --> 01:53:32.288]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[01:53:47.616 --> 01:53:49.117]  Call right now for $2 off per bottle.
[01:53:49.137 --> 01:53:49.537]  Mention GCN.
[01:53:49.777 --> 01:53:50.477]  Buy Sinofresh.com.
[01:53:50.718 --> 01:53:51.118]  It works!
[01:54:06.511 --> 01:54:14.676]  You know, I would love to not have to spend my time, half my time, trying to get the funding for this radio show, the films, the news websites, the bandwidth.
[01:54:15.816 --> 01:54:16.257]  Think about it.
[01:54:16.797 --> 01:54:22.940]  Of the five or six top viral films in history, I've produced or made or directed three or four of them.
[01:54:23.421 --> 01:54:30.945]  Hundreds of millions of people have seen my films for free, thanks to you supporting us, buying the books, the DVDs, supporting the sponsors to do it.
[01:54:31.926 --> 01:54:33.367]  Think of the effect you're having.
[01:54:33.827 --> 01:54:37.090]  We are the tip of the spear, and I've come to the realization of that.
[01:54:37.150 --> 01:54:38.871]  I've admitted that to myself.
[01:54:38.891 --> 01:54:40.492]  That's why I'm upping the ante.
[01:54:40.812 --> 01:54:43.174]  We're trying to finish the television studio.
[01:54:43.634 --> 01:54:45.195]  We're trying to do it as cheaply as possible.
[01:54:46.136 --> 01:54:56.904]  But, Tim, the guy didn't want his name known, so I won't show it, Tim came in during the break with a $10,000 donation for the Money Bomb coming up in October.
[01:54:57.184 --> 01:54:58.685]  That drives it to over $30,000 we've raised.
[01:55:01.684 --> 01:55:10.126]  But that sounds like a lot, not when you've got 20 employees or contractors, the equipment, the $20,000 plus bandwidth bill a month, all of it.
[01:55:10.466 --> 01:55:14.887]  We are having a huge effect thanks to you, and thank you for the support to Keith.
[01:55:14.947 --> 01:55:15.767]  I'm just going to say that.
[01:55:16.348 --> 01:55:18.948]  We have now raised, because we haven't updated in a few days, it was at $19,000.
[01:55:19.068 --> 01:55:21.309]  It's really about $23,000 we've raised.
[01:55:21.629 --> 01:55:22.489]  So with this, we've raised $33,000.
[01:55:22.909 --> 01:55:26.750]  He also sent this nice book with a little note in it.
[01:55:27.130 --> 01:55:27.730]  Thank you, Keith.
[01:55:28.210 --> 01:55:30.291]  Give that back to the guys to be deposited in the Money Bomb account.
[01:55:31.482 --> 01:55:39.606]  By the way, we've created a separate account for the Money Bomb to make sure that every dime of that specific money for the Money Bomb, none of it goes to Alex Jones.
[01:55:39.626 --> 01:55:47.329]  Because obviously I keep some of the funds that come in here to fund my operation, to have money in case we ever get sued to defend ourselves, which has happened, and I'm not going to get into it.
[01:55:47.349 --> 01:55:51.011]  The point is, is that, is that
[01:55:54.147 --> 01:55:55.530]  I did this with the last two money bombs.
[01:55:55.650 --> 01:55:58.897]  It's put separately and then it's used, all of it, for the equipment.
[01:55:59.117 --> 01:56:00.079]  All of it for the material.
[01:56:00.581 --> 01:56:00.981]  All of it.
[01:56:01.703 --> 01:56:02.044]  All of it.
[01:56:04.642 --> 01:56:05.903]  And we need your support.
[01:56:05.943 --> 01:56:10.145]  I mean, I've built the new 7,000 plus square foot facility, but it's empty.
[01:56:10.345 --> 01:56:12.126]  And we shot the tour a few days ago.
[01:56:12.146 --> 01:56:13.227]  It'll be ready on Monday.
[01:56:13.527 --> 01:56:19.850]  The video we put together, we'll put it up on YouTube and PrisonPlanet.tv and at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com if you want to go there and support us.
[01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:22.652]  We've got other deals going when you buy the DVDs.
[01:56:22.792 --> 01:56:23.832]  Four copies of Endgame, $19.95.
[01:56:26.072 --> 01:56:28.494]  High quality DVD, color cover, shrink wrap.
[01:56:28.554 --> 01:56:30.355]  People will watch this and they'll understand.
[01:56:31.296 --> 01:56:35.119]  Glenn Becks' whole show next week is on world population reduction carried out by world government.
[01:56:35.299 --> 01:56:35.920]  Praise God!
[01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:37.301]  Good, I want to support him.
[01:56:38.402 --> 01:56:42.966]  I want to think that sections of the elite have woken up and are scared of what they've created and that they back off.
[01:56:43.206 --> 01:56:46.889]  I hope they're not just posing as patriots to get our confidence so they can get back in power.
[01:56:47.049 --> 01:56:48.010]  I'm sure that's what it is.
[01:56:49.377 --> 01:56:53.219]  But the point is, this film is word for word on his TV show yesterday.
[01:56:53.419 --> 01:56:54.879]  They're just literally lifting everything.
[01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:55.360]  Good!
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:56.400]  I love it!
[01:56:57.381 --> 01:57:00.262]  I could care less if I don't get credit, because the information's getting out.
[01:57:00.902 --> 01:57:02.103]  But get the full truth.
[01:57:02.243 --> 01:57:02.643]  Endgame.
[01:57:02.903 --> 01:57:04.444]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:57:05.004 --> 01:57:04.444]  1995.
[01:57:05.564 --> 01:57:06.245]  Four copies.
[01:57:06.305 --> 01:57:07.485]  Infowars.com.
[01:57:08.045 --> 01:57:10.627]  Or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:57:10.707 --> 01:57:13.048]  And this special's ending next week.
[01:57:13.328 --> 01:57:14.348]  Get the Obama deception. 1995.
[01:57:16.482 --> 01:57:20.806]  Jesse Ventura's American Conspiracies book, $24.95 value, hardcover, free.
[01:57:21.146 --> 01:57:22.167]  Special ends next week.
[01:57:25.449 --> 01:57:30.233]  And again, I'd love it if some billionaire came along and gave us $10 million to operate for four or five years.
[01:57:30.894 --> 01:57:34.717]  And believe me, you would see almost all the advertising end on this show.
[01:57:35.057 --> 01:57:38.140]  You'd still hear the ads during the breaks, because that's for the radio network and stations.
[01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:43.284]  The ads you hear that I do every hour, sometimes I didn't do anything last hour, that's what we fund it with!
[01:57:46.411 --> 01:57:48.052]  That's what we fund this operation with.
[01:57:50.033 --> 01:57:52.435]  You know what I'm paid every two weeks by Ted Anderson?
[01:57:52.455 --> 01:57:52.435]  $900.
[01:57:52.915 --> 01:57:57.258]  That's how little Ted Anderson and Genesis Communications is.
[01:57:57.958 --> 01:58:01.080]  Genesis Communications loses money most years.
[01:58:01.421 --> 01:58:04.743]  Ted, five years ago, had to put double mortgage on his house.
[01:58:08.717 --> 01:58:09.698]  I'm not going to even tell the story.
[01:58:09.738 --> 01:58:15.106]  Everything he went through and his family breaking up and everything else to keep this on the air.
[01:58:15.126 --> 01:58:17.650]  He's 100% Patriot, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:22.443 --> 01:58:23.704]  Infowars.com.
[01:58:24.264 --> 01:58:25.825]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[01:58:26.205 --> 01:58:27.606]  The online video bookstore.
[01:58:27.626 --> 01:58:31.328]  888-253-3139 if you want to call and donate.
[01:58:31.708 --> 01:58:38.352]  We're going to just start pushing the money bomb ahead of October 14th because we're under massive hacking attack trying to shut us down right now.
[01:58:42.514 --> 01:58:45.796]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:59:54.814 --> 01:59:57.675]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:04.980]  Big Brother.
[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:06.681]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.401 --> 02:00:08.542]  Government cover-ups.

[02:00:10.744 --> 02:00:11.704]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.305 --> 02:00:15.967]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.487 --> 02:00:20.550]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:32.675]  We are now into our number three, and boy, he said it would happen a few months ago, and it happened.
[02:00:32.695 --> 02:00:33.735]  $1,300 gold today.
[02:00:37.170 --> 02:00:38.891]  And Bob Chapman is rarely wrong.
[02:00:39.772 --> 02:00:41.212]  He hedged his bet, though, last week.
[02:00:41.232 --> 02:00:43.654]  He said it'll probably back off.
[02:00:44.394 --> 02:00:46.696]  He said it might hit $1,300, but then back off.
[02:00:46.736 --> 02:00:48.937]  We'll see in the next hour if he's right about that.
[02:00:48.957 --> 02:00:50.518]  In fact, what is gold right now?
[02:00:51.358 --> 02:00:54.180]  But Bob Chapman certainly called it.
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:01:02.004]  Max Keiser was on, what was it, a few days ago, and he said we're in a bear market for gold.
[02:01:02.284 --> 02:01:04.306]  Only 1% are actually buying gold right now.
[02:01:05.186 --> 02:01:06.546]  Of yuppies, of the general public.
[02:01:06.847 --> 02:01:09.127]  Institutions, banks are hoarding it, buying it up.
[02:01:10.228 --> 02:01:18.970]  But once 2, 3, 4 percent start buying it, which is beginning, some analysts on MSNBC are talking about, CNBC, $11,000 an ounce gold.
[02:01:19.351 --> 02:01:20.251]  But I'll take $1,300.
[02:01:20.831 --> 02:01:25.052]  Of course, for inflation, it should be $25 or more an ounce for 1980 numbers.
[02:01:25.553 --> 02:01:29.634]  But Bob of TheInternationalForecaster.com, you've been proven right yet again.
[02:01:31.314 --> 02:01:41.160]  Well, I thank you, and it's nice being that way, and I have a very strong hand in my shoulder, evidently, and I'm appreciative of that.
[02:01:41.961 --> 02:01:55.309]  Today, we fiddled around close to the $1,300 area, although October is still trading, and the spot market, I think, was up close to $4, so that puts it around $1,295, and it's very surprising
[02:01:59.770 --> 02:02:10.096]  That we would get this kind of result, and the reason why is that normally this week, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and then Monday, gold should have been backing off.
[02:02:10.136 --> 02:02:16.299]  And the reason why is that on Monday, it's gold and silver option expiration.
[02:02:16.319 --> 02:02:19.741]  And at $1,300 or higher, there's 46,000 contracts that are in the money.
[02:02:19.761 --> 02:02:21.582]  And if gold on Monday closes above
[02:02:29.915 --> 02:02:40.504]  $1300, there's going to be billions of dollars lost by the commercials on ComEx, who happen to be big banks.
[02:02:40.544 --> 02:02:43.887]  So we could see some real fireworks next week?
[02:02:44.887 --> 02:02:45.868]  We certainly could.
[02:02:46.128 --> 02:02:58.719]  And gold is telling us that it's going higher, even with all the selling that's going on by the commercials, who have record positions in the short side net.
[02:03:01.409 --> 02:03:01.850]  I don't know.
[02:03:19.798 --> 02:03:33.003]  Now, Bob, I interrupted you there when you talked about who is going to be short, who's going to be in trouble next Monday if it closes above or right at $1,300, and you were saying the big mega banks that have been trying to suppress it.
[02:03:34.324 --> 02:03:34.784]  That's right.
[02:03:34.844 --> 02:03:40.986]  Now, how much trouble on a net basis spread out among the firms, you know, remains to be seen.
[02:03:42.147 --> 02:03:47.269]  But the players are the big ones, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup,
[02:03:48.193 --> 02:03:54.614]  Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and there's others, but they're the biggies.
[02:03:55.314 --> 02:04:06.756]  And they probably have the largest net short positions, and they will lose the most amount of money on those long gold and silver options.
[02:04:07.757 --> 02:04:10.857]  Silver has been trading quite strongly today.
[02:04:12.717 --> 02:04:15.898]  Early, early this morning, around 4 o'clock,
[02:04:16.750 --> 02:04:20.693]  It was up 16 cents and recently it was up 19.
[02:04:22.154 --> 02:04:28.139]  So it held its gains all day, which again is surprising, but it's terrific.
[02:04:28.866 --> 02:04:35.148]  Especially if you have been buying gold and silver coins or bullion from Midas.
[02:04:35.529 --> 02:04:36.069]  We'll stay there.
[02:04:36.109 --> 02:04:37.769]  We gotta go to break, Bob Chapman.
[02:04:37.789 --> 02:04:39.470]  We'll find out why this happened.
[02:04:39.550 --> 02:04:41.011]  Obviously, you said net last week.
[02:04:41.651 --> 02:04:46.573]  If on Monday and Tuesday the Federal Reserve announces they're gonna start monetizing more debt, more quantitative easing.
[02:04:47.193 --> 02:04:48.254]  That this was going to happen.
[02:04:48.314 --> 02:04:49.235]  They did do that.
[02:04:49.575 --> 02:04:51.317]  What does that mean for the overall economy?
[02:04:51.677 --> 02:04:55.780]  We know what's happening with commodities like gold, but what does this mean overall?
[02:04:56.321 --> 02:04:58.182]  For me, it means an acceleration of implosion.
[02:04:58.202 --> 02:04:58.643]  Stay with us.
[02:04:59.243 --> 02:05:03.467]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[02:05:03.787 --> 02:05:07.850]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:08.130 --> 02:05:08.591]  Number two,
[02:05:08.971 --> 02:05:13.535]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:13.855 --> 02:05:14.316]  It's true.
[02:05:14.596 --> 02:05:20.021]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.301 --> 02:05:23.584]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:23.884 --> 02:05:27.628]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:28.608 --> 02:05:30.970]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:31.371 --> 02:05:34.714]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:35.014 --> 02:05:39.736]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:39.956 --> 02:05:44.737]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:05:59.116 --> 02:06:03.037]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:06:03.277 --> 02:06:09.318]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:06:09.678 --> 02:06:16.780]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:06:17.060 --> 02:06:21.641]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:06:34.864 --> 02:06:41.027]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:06:41.627 --> 02:06:45.049]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[02:07:55.307 --> 02:07:56.127]  Check them out today.
[02:08:03.393 --> 02:08:06.896]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:08:07.208 --> 02:08:24.586]  I know our audience is very sophisticated, Bob Chapman, but we're on so many AM and FM affiliates and have new listeners, they're like, why should I care about gold?
[02:08:26.112 --> 02:08:28.033]  Or why should I care if the dollar's devalued?
[02:08:28.293 --> 02:08:31.315]  Or why should I care if the stock market plunges?
[02:08:31.355 --> 02:08:35.758]  Well, if the stock market plunges, that then destroys a lot of companies that employ Americans.
[02:08:36.279 --> 02:08:42.242]  If gold's going up, it means the dollar's being devalued, and there's monetization of debt going on.
[02:08:42.262 --> 02:08:50.988]  The same thing that happened in the Weimar Republic, Mexico, Argentina, I mean, the list goes on and on, Nigeria, Zimbabwe.
[02:08:51.008 --> 02:08:54.890]  I mean, this is a big deal that they've openly
[02:08:55.851 --> 02:09:00.473]  Congress has admitted trying to suppress the price of gold, the big central banks, and they're failing.
[02:09:00.973 --> 02:09:10.896]  And now that it's touched $1,300 an ounce this morning, even though the big banks were betting against gold and trying to push it down, they're failing.
[02:09:13.072 --> 02:09:17.956]  What does this overall signify in the economy, and where do you see gold going?
[02:09:18.476 --> 02:09:28.003]  I'll ask the same question that Bloomberg put out a month ago, that the majority of the futures on gold in the US in the month of December at $1,500 or more.
[02:09:28.824 --> 02:09:32.967]  I mean, why would they be betting on $1,500 in December if it's not going to go there?
[02:09:35.329 --> 02:09:37.650]  Well, they think it's going there, and that's why they are.
[02:09:38.331 --> 02:09:42.294]  And if you look at the gold long option positions,
[02:09:43.321 --> 02:09:54.049]  There's 46,000 contracts that would be in the money, so to speak, on Monday if gold closes above $1,300.
[02:09:54.149 --> 02:10:02.636]  And I would guess that part of those contracts that were purchased were purchased by people who are long gold bullion.
[02:10:03.590 --> 02:10:10.774]  And, uh, it's my suspicion that they're going to try to kick it over $1,300 so they'll be able to collect on their bet.
[02:10:11.295 --> 02:10:16.118]  And, of course, the commercials are fighting back as hard as they can, but it's not working.
[02:10:16.138 --> 02:10:19.260]  Okay, but for new listeners, explain what short and long means.
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:20.500]  Explain this.
[02:10:21.601 --> 02:10:31.087]  Short is when you bet something is going down, whether it's gold or silver or the market or a particular stock.
[02:10:32.207 --> 02:10:33.048]  When you're long,
[02:10:33.894 --> 02:10:39.917]  You are betting that the security of the gold, of the commodity, is going up.
[02:10:40.897 --> 02:10:50.662]  And so, what the commercials, which are the banks, on ComEx do, is they will sell long contracts to other people.
[02:10:51.482 --> 02:10:57.545]  And they will try to continue to suppress the price, in this case of gold, so that it doesn't go over $1,300.
[02:10:57.585 --> 02:10:58.506]  Because of the 46,000 contracts,
[02:11:02.066 --> 02:11:06.110]  About 25,000 of them are at $1,300 or higher.
[02:11:06.551 --> 02:11:10.595]  And this is why there's this titanic battle going on right now.
[02:11:10.655 --> 02:11:11.957]  It'll be over on Monday.
[02:11:12.437 --> 02:11:18.784]  But the price of gold and silver both are showing that they want to go higher.
[02:11:19.365 --> 02:11:21.487]  And of course, this is terrifying the commercials.
[02:11:21.912 --> 02:11:32.437]  Because they're representing the United States government, who are actively, and have been actively, suppressing the price of gold and silver for a long, long time, like back to 1988.
[02:11:33.658 --> 02:11:35.819]  And so, this is a big event.
[02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:47.025]  And once it breaks up, which I believe it will, silver could go to $30 pretty easily, because there's a monstrous short position in silver by JPMorgan Chase.
[02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.849]  Yeah.
[02:12:17.421 --> 02:12:18.101]  Short covering.
[02:12:19.282 --> 02:12:22.204]  Meaning that they have to buy back what they sold.
[02:12:22.984 --> 02:12:25.866]  And when they do that, they make the price go higher.
[02:12:26.466 --> 02:12:30.208]  So silver could go to $30 in the next several weeks.
[02:12:30.849 --> 02:12:31.609]  And gold could go to $1,500.
[02:12:32.170 --> 02:12:38.053]  And that's why you see the December contracts at $1,500 are loaded up.
[02:12:38.613 --> 02:12:44.917]  Because there's a lot of people out there, and most of these people who are in that market are professionals, on the long side.
[02:12:46.346 --> 02:12:47.827]  And the banks are on the short side.
[02:12:49.528 --> 02:12:52.510]  And they think it's going there, and I do too.
[02:12:52.530 --> 02:12:57.633]  I mean, if you go back to 1980 and you use the formula used by the U.S.
[02:12:57.673 --> 02:13:03.236]  government for inflation, gold should be selling close to $2,400 an ounce.
[02:13:03.836 --> 02:13:12.701]  If you use real inflation, without the government bogus figures that they've been putting out since then, you've got $7,700 an ounce.
[02:13:15.026 --> 02:13:16.807]  I mean, this is fundamentals.
[02:13:17.908 --> 02:13:20.110]  I mean, this is not something we're guessing about.
[02:13:20.170 --> 02:13:22.992]  This is a reflection of what really has gone on.
[02:13:23.572 --> 02:13:25.214]  So gold and silver are going to go higher.
[02:13:26.134 --> 02:13:29.737]  You know, we went long in June of 2000, and gold was about $2.60.
[02:13:30.878 --> 02:13:32.379]  Coins were selling for
[02:13:39.875 --> 02:13:46.299]  Somewhere in the vicinity of $270 apiece, and now they're selling for over $1,200.
[02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:53.444]  Stocks that we had people purchase were selling at $0.85, and $4, and $5.
[02:13:53.964 --> 02:13:59.088]  Now they're at $20, and $45, and $70 a share.
[02:14:00.029 --> 02:14:02.030]  And we don't encourage people to trade.
[02:14:02.050 --> 02:14:02.830]  You're in a trend.
[02:14:03.611 --> 02:14:04.451]  You go with the trend.
[02:14:04.532 --> 02:14:05.192]  It's your friend.
[02:14:06.013 --> 02:14:09.535]  The biggest bull market in history is right before our eyes.
[02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:16.041]  Massive amounts of money being made in the gold and silver related asset market.
[02:14:16.541 --> 02:14:18.762]  And this is only the end of phase one.
[02:14:19.242 --> 02:14:22.182]  We've got phases two, three, and four to go.
[02:14:23.263 --> 02:14:24.783]  These are waves that are coming.
[02:14:25.803 --> 02:14:31.544]  And so people should be in there, and they should be out of the stock market in general, except for gold and silver shares.
[02:14:32.364 --> 02:14:32.925]  And bonds?
[02:14:33.525 --> 02:14:34.925]  The bond market is a bubble.
[02:14:35.325 --> 02:14:39.606]  When it's going to break, I don't know, but somewhere along the way, it is.
[02:14:42.677 --> 02:14:46.400]  Now, what does that signify overall about the health of the economy?
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:15:07.318]  We saw on Monday, Bob, the federal government came out and said to the recession, this is a good joke, ended in June of last year, so 15 months ago, when every major economic indicator the feds put out, which are Cook themselves, shows we're in a deep ongoing recession and most analysts, even mainline analysts, are saying we're going into a depression.
[02:15:09.059 --> 02:15:10.941]  Well, it just shows you how evil they are and how
[02:15:11.617 --> 02:15:41.006]  uh... badly construed the propaganda is and how blatant they are and what they do desperate people do desperate things and they are in serious trouble because there's no way back after June of 2003 the die was cast there was no turning back for the people who were involved in bringing the the markets down and and doing what they did uh... within the economy with real estate that really
[02:15:41.471 --> 02:15:42.452]  Take this thing off.
[02:15:43.312 --> 02:15:45.614]  And so what can we expect?
[02:15:46.515 --> 02:15:48.797]  We can expect inflation will be higher.
[02:15:49.797 --> 02:15:57.543]  We can also expect that it could turn over the next two or three years into hyperinflation, maybe even quicker than that.
[02:15:59.184 --> 02:16:09.652]  And we also can expect that the economy and this is the question really that you asked the economy, even if they inject another $2.5 trillion
[02:16:11.255 --> 02:16:17.941]  Including any legislative stimulus like they did in the last 17 months.
[02:16:18.742 --> 02:16:24.808]  The best they can do is grow GDP by 1% and it may be worse than that.
[02:16:25.689 --> 02:16:27.110]  And so what are we looking at?
[02:16:27.130 --> 02:16:31.134]  We're looking at a sideways movement that's not going to improve employment.
[02:16:33.541 --> 02:16:35.802]  You should see the letters I get from people.
[02:16:36.162 --> 02:16:37.242]  They're heartbreaking.
[02:16:37.703 --> 02:16:39.263]  I just got one from Ontario.
[02:16:39.744 --> 02:16:45.506]  The man's been out of work for seven years because his job was outsourced to China.
[02:16:45.526 --> 02:16:47.667]  And he was in the automobile industry.
[02:16:47.987 --> 02:16:49.548]  And it goes on and on and on.
[02:16:49.568 --> 02:16:55.471]  I mean, people who have worked all their lives, who are retired, they don't have anything.
[02:16:56.631 --> 02:16:58.672]  You know, can you lend me some money?
[02:16:58.992 --> 02:17:00.073]  I can't pay my bills.
[02:17:01.050 --> 02:17:02.691]  I can't even shop for groceries.
[02:17:03.192 --> 02:17:06.675]  And this is only the beginning of this nasty disaster.
[02:17:07.415 --> 02:17:10.558]  Can you imagine when it's going to be like a year or two from now?
[02:17:11.719 --> 02:17:12.720]  And so it's not good.
[02:17:12.940 --> 02:17:18.405]  Well, they're just going to come out in a year or two and just tell us the economy is wonderful.
[02:17:19.465 --> 02:17:22.108]  We could all be homeless in the streets like the Great Depression.
[02:17:22.128 --> 02:17:22.908]  They'll say it's great.
[02:17:24.370 --> 02:17:27.172]  Well, if you look at the homeless centers
[02:17:27.668 --> 02:17:37.430]  And if you look at the centers where they give out free food, people are lining up at midnight and two in the morning to be there when they open at nine o'clock.
[02:17:38.510 --> 02:17:56.253]  I just put a tape, a link into the forecaster for tomorrow, where I viewed these people, and they're a galaxy of people just like you and I. Normal, everyday, hard-working people who lost their jobs, or retired, or they're ill,
[02:17:57.133 --> 02:17:58.094]  And they don't have anything.
[02:17:58.114 --> 02:18:01.795]  I mean, what is it going to be like two years from now?
[02:18:01.835 --> 02:18:05.417]  Never mind four or five years from now.
[02:18:06.138 --> 02:18:07.058]  It's going to be awful.
[02:18:07.898 --> 02:18:09.639]  And they're not doing anything to fix it.
[02:18:09.980 --> 02:18:11.220]  They're just throwing money at it.
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:16.843]  And most of the money is being thrown into the hands of Wall Street and banking.
[02:18:22.410 --> 02:18:26.014]  And it's just getting worse and worse and worse by the minute.
[02:18:26.735 --> 02:18:34.543]  Bob, I want to go to break, and I want to later get into some other news and get your take on it, dealing with the economy and some geopolitical developments.
[02:18:35.524 --> 02:18:40.969]  But I want to open the phones up specifically for economic questions for you.
[02:18:41.730 --> 02:18:50.092]  Now folks, a lot of times we have totally open phones on any subject, or I say first-time callers, but sometimes I say specifically for our guests, on the economy.
[02:18:50.792 --> 02:18:52.732]  That's the questions we're going to be taking for Bob Chapman.
[02:18:52.752 --> 02:18:53.092]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:18:53.112 --> 02:18:56.033]  1-800-259-9231 on any questions or comments you have on the economy.
[02:18:56.053 --> 02:19:00.054]  With this quantitative easing, with the announcements they're going to monetize more debts,
[02:19:10.496 --> 02:19:13.417]  Where do you and your gut expect gold to be in December, Bob?
[02:19:14.958 --> 02:19:22.861]  Oh, I think it'll be $1,500, $1,600, and silver could be as high as $30 announced, but $25 to $30 would be a good gain.
[02:19:23.682 --> 02:19:31.585]  And, you know, we announced on this program ten weeks ago that we were going to have quantitative easing, and nobody came out with that besides me.
[02:19:32.145 --> 02:19:36.447]  And now we're going to have it, and another very important event was the loss
[02:19:37.043 --> 02:19:51.031]  of Larry Summers, who is one of the architects of the suppression of gold and silver, which means, if anything, we're going to have a better chance of beating the government at their own game, because their brilliant architect is now leaving.
[02:19:51.912 --> 02:19:54.013]  But they're just replacing him with some other puppet.
[02:19:54.053 --> 02:19:55.914]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman.
[02:19:56.194 --> 02:19:58.756]  On the other side, your phone calls, presentplanet.com.
[02:20:00.134 --> 02:20:00.674]  You worry.
[02:20:01.075 --> 02:20:02.795]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[02:20:03.096 --> 02:20:05.317]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:20:05.637 --> 02:20:07.458]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[02:20:07.718 --> 02:20:08.939]  Your answer may be at hand.
[02:20:09.319 --> 02:20:12.541]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[02:20:12.921 --> 02:20:17.784]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[02:20:18.164 --> 02:20:21.486]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:20:21.966 --> 02:20:23.307]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:20:23.667 --> 02:20:26.268]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[02:20:26.528 --> 02:20:29.470]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[02:20:29.810 --> 02:20:37.976]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[02:20:38.256 --> 02:20:42.660]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[02:20:52.687 --> 02:20:55.569]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:20:55.589 --> 02:20:58.091]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[02:20:59.707 --> 02:21:04.571]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:21:04.671 --> 02:21:05.451]  What have we got?
[02:21:05.671 --> 02:21:07.793]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:21:08.113 --> 02:21:08.854]  A republic.
[02:21:09.134 --> 02:21:11.716]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:21:11.776 --> 02:21:13.697]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:21:14.038 --> 02:21:15.939]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:21:16.059 --> 02:21:17.340]  So they think they own our land?
[02:21:17.740 --> 02:21:18.861]  They think they own our water?
[02:21:19.061 --> 02:21:19.462]  Children?
[02:21:19.682 --> 02:21:20.462]  Our education?
[02:21:20.803 --> 02:21:21.443]  Our money?
[02:21:21.623 --> 02:21:25.286]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:21:25.626 --> 02:21:30.291]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:21:30.611 --> 02:21:31.432]  We have the facts.
[02:21:31.632 --> 02:21:32.753]  We have the Constitution.
[02:21:32.793 --> 02:21:33.674]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:21:33.694 --> 02:21:34.535]  We have common law.
[02:21:34.595 --> 02:21:36.837]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:37.117 --> 02:21:40.901]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:21:41.001 --> 02:21:45.783]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:21:45.943 --> 02:21:47.304]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:21:47.444 --> 02:21:48.284]  Don't tread on me.

[02:21:59.611 --> 02:22:00.752]  This may surprise you.
[02:22:00.972 --> 02:22:05.195]  Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions among both adults and children.
[02:22:05.455 --> 02:22:07.096]  You or someone you know may have it.
[02:22:07.276 --> 02:22:10.839]  Managing type 2 diabetes in conventional ways is a never-ending task.
[02:22:11.019 --> 02:22:13.341]  But this good news may also surprise you.
[02:22:13.561 --> 02:22:18.925]  A recent UCLA study proved that type 2 diabetes can be reversed in only 21 days.
[02:22:19.145 --> 02:22:26.610]  Puriam Health Products recently developed a product that mimics the healthy diet used in that UCLA study called Scoop of Greens, an easy

[02:24:06.913 --> 02:24:09.634]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:11.738 --> 02:24:17.482]  Let's go directly to your phone calls for Bob Chapman on this Friday edition.
[02:24:17.502 --> 02:24:18.883]  I'll be back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:24:18.923 --> 02:24:20.804]  Central for the abbreviated broadcast.
[02:24:20.824 --> 02:24:21.565]  Don't forget about that.
[02:24:21.985 --> 02:24:24.066]  Eric in Illinois, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:24:24.086 --> 02:24:24.426]  Go ahead.
[02:24:24.446 --> 02:24:27.428]  Hey, Bob Chapman, just a quick question.
[02:24:27.468 --> 02:24:35.033]  Just wondering what percentage would you recommend to put for someone to put their investment into gold?
[02:24:35.053 --> 02:24:37.295]  A lot of people say diversify, but
[02:24:38.061 --> 02:24:42.544]  You know, are we at a point where we should diversify just between gold and silver and that's about it?
[02:24:42.925 --> 02:24:44.185]  Or what would you recommend?
[02:24:45.366 --> 02:24:48.749]  Well, I feel gold and silver is the only place to be.
[02:24:49.189 --> 02:24:50.850]  It's the only place your money is safe.
[02:24:51.671 --> 02:24:54.012]  And there's no guarantees of anything, of course.
[02:24:54.593 --> 02:24:56.794]  But I've done this for a long, long time.
[02:24:57.535 --> 02:25:01.458]  And my assets are totally in gold and silver.
[02:25:02.198 --> 02:25:06.381]  And so, and I continue to buy all, you know, whenever I can.
[02:25:07.142 --> 02:25:07.482]  And so,
[02:25:08.352 --> 02:25:31.748]  For those of you who think about diversification, how can you diversify safely when you get a bond market that's in a bubble and you don't know when it's going to burst, and you get a stock market that's overpriced, the pensions for these Fortune 500 companies are all underfunded, they're going to have to take that off of their
[02:25:32.828 --> 02:25:41.281]  Uh... earnings next year in order to fund them up so to speak and then if the market goes down in the coming year they're going to have to
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:42.640]  We're good to go.
[02:26:12.430 --> 02:26:15.111]  And the only place to go would be commodities of gold and silver.
[02:26:15.431 --> 02:26:18.192]  So the answer is gold and silver all the way.
[02:26:18.212 --> 02:26:23.275]  All right, well, you know, I listened to you pretty intently, and Alex Jones pretty intently.
[02:26:23.295 --> 02:26:32.238]  So looks like, you know, as soon as I get off this unemployment and start making some real money, I guess it's all going to go into gold and silver.
[02:26:32.258 --> 02:26:33.799]  So I want to thank you guys for what you do.
[02:26:34.244 --> 02:26:34.704]  Thank you.
[02:26:35.665 --> 02:26:38.627]  I've bought a lot of silver because it's inexpensive comparatively.
[02:26:39.127 --> 02:26:42.489]  And a lot of the silver I bought was at five, six, seven, eight dollars an ounce.
[02:26:43.230 --> 02:26:45.551]  I haven't bought a lot since it went up.
[02:26:45.571 --> 02:26:46.892]  I just haven't really had the funds.
[02:26:47.472 --> 02:26:56.017]  But I mean, the silver I've got has all gone up three, four times what it was previously.
[02:26:56.798 --> 02:27:01.421]  And Bob, am I correct in saying that silver is even more suppressing what it should be than gold?
[02:27:02.734 --> 02:27:04.054]  Yes, that's correct, because J.P.
[02:27:04.495 --> 02:27:10.376]  Morgan Chase and Hong Kong Shanghai Bank have made a life's work out of suppressing the silver price.
[02:27:10.456 --> 02:27:14.678]  Now that it's breaking away to the upside, they're going to have to cover their short positions.
[02:27:15.498 --> 02:27:23.660]  And that's going to propel silver probably more strongly than any propulsion that gold would have.
[02:27:24.281 --> 02:27:32.183]  And so there's probably much more upside, at least in the short term, in silver than there is in gold.
[02:27:32.856 --> 02:27:35.839]  Although I think they'll go over time in tandem.
[02:27:36.259 --> 02:27:38.141]  And so what you do is you split your investment.
[02:27:38.561 --> 02:27:39.482]  Put part in both.
[02:27:39.822 --> 02:27:41.644]  Yeah, I want to be specific though.
[02:27:41.664 --> 02:27:50.271]  You know, I'm no financial guru like Bob Chapman or even a lot of the mainline analysts agreeing with the things he's saying or somebody like Max Keiser.
[02:27:50.811 --> 02:27:52.513]  But when I bought gold at 300 an ounce,
[02:27:53.914 --> 02:27:56.695]  And it went up to 500 and then went down a little bit, I didn't sell it.
[02:27:57.175 --> 02:28:02.437]  And when I bought gold at 900 an ounce, and it went up to 1,000, I didn't sell it.
[02:28:02.477 --> 02:28:04.498]  And when it dropped back down to 900, I didn't sell it.
[02:28:04.858 --> 02:28:10.381]  And when I bought gold at 800, and now it's 1,300, I'm not selling it.
[02:28:10.681 --> 02:28:14.582]  And if they manipulate things for a while and it goes down a little bit, I'm not going to sell it then.
[02:28:15.103 --> 02:28:16.683]  I'm in this for the long haul.
[02:28:16.983 --> 02:28:20.365]  And if you look at a 10-year graph on gold and silver, it's going straight up.
[02:28:20.445 --> 02:28:20.925]  Correct, Bob?
[02:28:22.265 --> 02:28:30.228]  That's my take on it, and I've been doing this for over 50 years, and at one time, for 28 years, I was the largest gold service stockbroker in the world.
[02:28:30.808 --> 02:28:39.372]  So I certainly have a lot of experience in the area, and I know every blip for the past 50 years that's happened in that genre, so to speak.
[02:28:39.872 --> 02:28:46.395]  And so, yes, you're right, it's going to go up, because all the currencies in the world are in trouble.
[02:28:47.095 --> 02:28:50.496]  They have all fallen for the last seven years against gold.
[02:28:50.576 --> 02:28:51.757]  If you look at compound
[02:28:52.285 --> 02:28:57.208]  Increases in the price of gold over the last nine years.
[02:28:57.549 --> 02:29:00.110]  It's just under 20% of year a year.
[02:29:00.451 --> 02:29:06.775]  No other investment has returned that over that last nine years, and it's going to continue.
[02:29:07.595 --> 02:29:09.457]  And Wall Street isn't even in on it.
[02:29:09.517 --> 02:29:11.378]  The public isn't even in on it yet.
[02:29:11.918 --> 02:29:14.640]  I mean, wait till buying starts in earnest.
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:16.381]  What do we got?
[02:29:16.401 --> 02:29:19.303]  2% of the public in the United States in gold and silver.
[02:29:19.824 --> 02:29:21.865]  What's going to happen when we replicate?
[02:29:22.463 --> 02:29:30.187]  What went on in 1980 when we had about 15% of the population in gold and silver.
[02:29:30.688 --> 02:29:31.848]  And they're gonna go ballistic.
[02:29:32.009 --> 02:29:33.709]  Alright, we gotta go to break.
[02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:35.290]  I want to try to hurry through more of the calls.
[02:29:35.491 --> 02:29:37.812]  Ed, Woody, Taylor, Brian and others.
[02:29:37.832 --> 02:29:42.034]  800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[02:29:42.054 --> 02:29:43.335]  We're talking about the economy.
[02:29:43.855 --> 02:29:45.576]  The evidence shows we're going into a depression.
[02:29:46.057 --> 02:29:48.078]  But Obama, he says things are good.
[02:29:49.912 --> 02:29:52.914]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.835 --> 02:29:56.596]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.298 --> 02:30:00.519]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:00.559 --> 02:30:03.721]  Remember when I said you spell freedom F-O-O-D?
[02:30:03.901 --> 02:30:04.602]  It's really true.
[02:30:04.882 --> 02:30:08.764]  Legislation is in the process of restricting the growing and sharing of food.
[02:30:09.044 --> 02:30:14.248]  And a record number of Americans, over 43 million, depend on the government to feed themselves.
[02:30:14.488 --> 02:30:16.349]  Food prices are going up for Americans.
[02:30:16.569 --> 02:30:19.790]  Prices are going up even for eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:30:19.970 --> 02:30:23.212]  This will require their first price increase in three years.
[02:30:23.492 --> 02:30:34.757]  The most important thing Americans can do for their own freedom and survival in these hardest of times is to get supplies of high quality storable food because of the huge response to this buy three and get one free special.
[02:30:35.097 --> 02:30:39.000]  eFoodsDirect.com will continue this special until September 27th.
[02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:42.202]  Right now, you can buy three and get one free at the old prices.
[02:30:42.542 --> 02:30:45.685]  But move fast, because this offer ends September 27th.
[02:30:45.845 --> 02:30:46.165]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:30:46.185 --> 02:30:48.046]  Or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:30:48.066 --> 02:30:48.567]  That's 800-409-5633.
[02:30:48.667 --> 02:30:51.869]  Or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:30:59.568 --> 02:31:05.030]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:31:06.211 --> 02:31:10.973]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:31:11.353 --> 02:31:18.136]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:31:20.077 --> 02:31:22.358]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:31:24.139 --> 02:31:26.100]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:31:28.564 --> 02:31:32.467]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:31:33.167 --> 02:31:36.289]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[02:31:37.009 --> 02:31:37.810]  Others don't.
[02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:40.111]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:31:40.372 --> 02:31:41.873]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:31:42.153 --> 02:31:44.734]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:31:45.055 --> 02:31:51.299]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:31:51.679 --> 02:31:53.880]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:31:54.381 --> 02:31:56.422]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[02:31:56.742 --> 02:31:57.623]  Others don't.
[02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:03.023]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:03.343 --> 02:32:03.944]  Number 1.
[02:32:04.264 --> 02:32:07.406]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:07.687 --> 02:32:08.227]  Number 2.
[02:32:08.547 --> 02:32:13.091]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:13.431 --> 02:32:13.871]  It's true.
[02:32:14.171 --> 02:32:18.735]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:19.055 --> 02:32:19.595]  Number 3.
[02:32:19.876 --> 02:32:23.158]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:23.458 --> 02:32:27.161]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:27.361 --> 02:32:27.902]  Number 4.
[02:32:28.162 --> 02:32:30.525]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:30.925 --> 02:32:34.309]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:34.609 --> 02:32:34.809]  Number 5.
[02:32:35.390 --> 02:32:39.314]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:39.535 --> 02:32:44.300]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:44.580 --> 02:32:48.603]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:48.743 --> 02:32:50.304]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.544 --> 02:32:55.067]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:32:55.147 --> 02:33:03.893]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.522 --> 02:33:23.785]  We're going to go back to your calls here in just a moment, but I want to finish up talking about gold.
[02:33:23.805 --> 02:33:26.627]  Then I'm getting into this mail online story.
[02:33:27.007 --> 02:33:33.471]  Bono's won foundation under fire for giving a little over 1% of its funds to charity.
[02:33:34.772 --> 02:33:42.617]  Then you learn that most of it went to Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is eugenics, getting rid of people.
[02:33:43.477 --> 02:33:44.238]  What a sicko.
[02:33:44.258 --> 02:33:44.998]  What a sicko.
[02:33:45.098 --> 02:33:47.360]  I mean, or maybe he's a useful idiot that doesn't know.
[02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:48.921]  So we're going to cover that.
[02:33:50.768 --> 02:33:55.529]  And Paul Craig Roberts' article in InfoWars.com, the collapse of Western morality.
[02:33:56.250 --> 02:33:58.170]  There's another report here I want to talk about with Bob.
[02:33:58.690 --> 02:34:02.512]  The globalist plan for the coming world currency, it's now all out in the open.
[02:34:03.072 --> 02:34:11.954]  And the neocons and fake conservatives that were denying this existed for decades, when we could have beaten it easier, are now going, OK, some of it's real, but lowly commies run it.
[02:34:12.255 --> 02:34:14.095]  No, the big megacorporations run it.
[02:34:14.475 --> 02:34:15.576]  That's the big secret.
[02:34:16.276 --> 02:34:16.376]  OK?
[02:34:17.820 --> 02:34:25.025]  But I briefly wanted to bring Ted Anderson up while Bob Chapman was here, because I keep explaining this week to week with folks.
[02:34:25.966 --> 02:34:42.198]  You know, going back two months ago when gold was way down, when they artificially depressed it and Bob said it would pop up like a beach ball because of all the fundamentals, and the other analyst, and we have a bunch of analysts on, who basically concur, Ted then didn't raise gold prices, he sold out of that gold and silver at the lower price.
[02:34:43.527 --> 02:34:47.256]  Now, in the last three weeks or so, he's bought more gold than silver when it was
[02:34:48.513 --> 02:34:53.614]  Something like $100 less in gold, several dollars less in silver per ounce.
[02:34:54.174 --> 02:34:57.895]  Now he's passing on those savings, but I talked to Ted this morning.
[02:34:58.315 --> 02:34:59.775]  It's going to run out this weekend.
[02:34:59.795 --> 02:35:01.115]  There'll be another price increase.
[02:35:01.375 --> 02:35:02.996]  Then you're getting gold he got two weeks ago.
[02:35:03.216 --> 02:35:06.456]  It'll still be lower, but you need to take advantage of this now.
[02:35:07.216 --> 02:35:15.538]  And so, Ted, give people a wide spectrum breakdown of the Buffalo Coins, the Franks, the Sovereigns, some of the other stuff you've got at the super-reduced price.
[02:35:16.238 --> 02:35:21.340]  And what you're going to run out of first, and where are those silver half dollars that you had yesterday for $10.50?
[02:35:21.780 --> 02:35:22.700]  I don't know what it is now.
[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:27.582]  Everywhere else it's $12, $13, $14, $15, $16 for the exact same coin.
[02:35:28.682 --> 02:35:30.743]  I'm unable to find a deal lower than this anywhere.
[02:35:31.143 --> 02:35:32.963]  These are special radio offers.
[02:35:33.404 --> 02:35:35.544]  These are loss leaders for Midas Resources.
[02:35:35.884 --> 02:35:37.345]  Ted Anderson, tell us what you got today.
[02:35:37.751 --> 02:35:38.272]  Yeah, I know.
[02:35:38.332 --> 02:35:43.718]  Well, we put the buffalo right up on your website, so that's going to be a real easy place to find that coin.
[02:35:43.758 --> 02:35:44.699]  That's tough to get.
[02:35:44.779 --> 02:35:48.323]  Usually when the market gets real hot in gold, that one you can't even get your hands on.
[02:35:48.403 --> 02:35:52.828]  Yeah, and the article that has that link is goldbreakpsychologicalbarrierinfowars.com.
[02:35:53.408 --> 02:35:56.610]  Right, so go right to Infowars.com if you want to pick up that corner.
[02:35:56.650 --> 02:36:00.172]  You can call us right here at 800-686-2237.
[02:36:00.612 --> 02:36:03.313]  The British Sovereign currently right now is at $3.57.
[02:36:03.673 --> 02:36:05.674]  That's the same price I had it at yesterday.
[02:36:06.075 --> 02:36:07.996]  However, gold has now gone over to $1,301 an ounce.
[02:36:08.016 --> 02:36:10.957]  Alex, we said it was going to go over $1,300 an ounce yesterday.
[02:36:10.977 --> 02:36:11.297]  It happened.
[02:36:14.939 --> 02:36:16.720]  Now, we have Franks at $279.
[02:36:17.241 --> 02:36:22.183]  I mean, come on, I'm buying you an International Forecaster Newsletter subscription.
[02:36:22.464 --> 02:36:24.645]  That's $159 right there.
[02:36:25.125 --> 02:36:28.667]  It gets you down to about, you know, $560 an ounce.
[02:36:28.967 --> 02:36:29.428]  Gold's over $1,300.
[02:36:29.848 --> 02:36:34.791]  You're not going to find a better deal out that anywhere in the world for gold and silver, period.
[02:36:35.611 --> 02:36:37.593]  That walking liberty half.
[02:36:37.653 --> 02:36:40.015]  Now that is a really good buy.
[02:36:40.075 --> 02:36:46.701]  I was searching the buy it now prices on eBay just to make sure that I wasn't lying or misleading people.
[02:36:47.162 --> 02:36:52.246]  And you know Alex, I think I could find two coins to buy at $10 and the rest were up in the $12 to $15 to $16 range.
[02:36:54.768 --> 02:36:56.409]  And that's for circulated coins.
[02:36:56.850 --> 02:36:58.851]  I'm not talking about the big fancy ones.
[02:36:59.171 --> 02:37:00.492]  That's for circulated coins.
[02:37:00.813 --> 02:37:02.033]  The stuff is going up.
[02:37:02.854 --> 02:37:06.156]  The quantities of what's available is disappearing in the marketplace.
[02:37:06.577 --> 02:37:08.498]  We're now looking at shortages.
[02:37:08.918 --> 02:37:21.047]  It isn't going to be surprising to me if you start seeing banners being thrown up back on these gold and silver websites that say that, hey, you know, you may have placed your order today, but we can't deliver it today because there's a shortage in the marketplace.
[02:37:21.087 --> 02:37:22.310]  That's right Ted, that's the key.
[02:37:22.370 --> 02:37:25.679]  You have the coins, the gold and silver you're offering.
[02:37:25.719 --> 02:37:26.701]  You have it right now.
[02:37:27.679 --> 02:37:28.579]  That's the whole point.
[02:37:28.639 --> 02:37:39.305]  And getting it in your hands, getting it in your hands quickly, get it in your hands before the market, you know, takes even a further increase or the entire world just starts to melt apart.
[02:37:39.645 --> 02:37:52.511]  I mean, how long before we step into hyperinflation where people are just willing to trade their currency away to just about anything because the United States government keeps printing more money to solve its problems?
[02:37:52.671 --> 02:37:54.212]  Well, let me fire out the number 800-686-2237.
[02:37:54.312 --> 02:38:01.217]  You can also call and get a one-time complimentary, you know, 30-, 40-, 50-page newsletter.
[02:38:01.257 --> 02:38:02.798]  It varies twice a week.
[02:38:02.818 --> 02:38:07.281]  The digital version, the multi-time a month, hard version, they mail to you.
[02:38:07.321 --> 02:38:09.483]  This is invaluable intel.
[02:38:10.523 --> 02:38:17.428]  And again, I hope people will call or get the year subscription free when you get one franc already at a very low price.
[02:38:17.448 --> 02:38:17.488]  800-686-2237.
[02:38:20.310 --> 02:38:22.010]  Two, two, three, seven.
[02:38:22.451 --> 02:38:28.012]  And the brokers at Midas Resources, 30 plus people, will be there off and on throughout the weekend.
[02:38:28.352 --> 02:38:30.413]  Ted, here's the $64 million question.
[02:38:30.733 --> 02:38:34.453]  How long can you offer the prices that you just put out?
[02:38:34.674 --> 02:38:35.634]  Well, I can tell you.
[02:38:35.674 --> 02:38:40.095]  I know I'm going to run out of this inventory before the weekend is up, but I will hold it until Sunday.
[02:38:40.775 --> 02:38:41.916]  Now, prices are up.
[02:38:41.956 --> 02:38:47.200]  I mean, silver right now is the one that's taking the big increase, even though gold went to $1,300 at $130.
[02:38:47.620 --> 02:38:48.681]  Silver hit a high today of $21.48.
[02:38:49.741 --> 02:38:53.484]  I mean, we're just now approaching that $22 an ounce.
[02:38:53.924 --> 02:38:55.125]  I'm going to hold it until Sunday.
[02:38:55.605 --> 02:38:56.946]  I'll see what's going on on Monday.
[02:38:57.066 --> 02:38:59.408]  I doubt I'll be able to offer these prices again on Monday.
[02:38:59.548 --> 02:39:00.148]  800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[02:39:00.328 --> 02:39:16.092]  If you're hearing this tonight, before midnight, or hearing it Saturday or Sunday, you can call 800-686-2237, or you can call right now, or go to MidasResources.com, and he has that great offer.
[02:39:16.432 --> 02:39:28.875]  Just for my listeners and viewers, at InfoWars.com, Gold Breaks Psychological Barrier, at the bottom of the article, is the link to get the smoking hot deal on the highly sought-after gold buffalo.
[02:39:29.255 --> 02:39:30.596]  Ted, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:39:30.836 --> 02:39:32.357]  Thanks for having me up again.
[02:39:32.397 --> 02:39:34.138]  Again, 800-686-237.
[02:39:34.358 --> 02:39:38.000]  I'll just ask you, those are some pretty good deals, Bob.
[02:39:38.940 --> 02:39:40.661]  Personally, I can't find stuff lower.
[02:39:40.721 --> 02:39:41.642]  What's your take on it?
[02:39:42.702 --> 02:39:43.483]  Well, I think you're right.
[02:39:44.023 --> 02:39:49.646]  They're certainly competitive, and in many, many instances, they're lower than what the general market is.
[02:39:50.307 --> 02:39:52.768]  But, you know, prices vary all over the place.
[02:39:52.908 --> 02:39:56.250]  But they're good buys, and you should take advantage of them.
[02:39:56.670 --> 02:39:57.931]  You know, my feeling is this.
[02:39:58.610 --> 02:39:59.811]  Every month, I buy.
[02:40:00.531 --> 02:40:02.033]  And I don't care what it costs.
[02:40:02.253 --> 02:40:03.754]  I don't even ask what it costs.
[02:40:04.274 --> 02:40:12.840]  I just say, look, this is how much money I've got, and this is what I think I want to buy it in this genre this week, and get it for me.
[02:40:13.481 --> 02:40:14.402]  And that's what happens.
[02:40:14.982 --> 02:40:23.008]  And so, when you're in a long-term bull market, even though prices might be super, that Ted is offering, that's great.
[02:40:23.806 --> 02:40:28.849]  But more importantly, you just keep on buying because it's the only safe place to be.
[02:40:29.810 --> 02:40:30.350]  Absolutely.
[02:40:30.370 --> 02:40:30.770]  800-686-237.
[02:40:30.890 --> 02:40:35.253]  I feel really good, Bob.
[02:40:35.293 --> 02:40:38.815]  I mean, if it wasn't for Ted, I wouldn't have had this platform for this radio show.
[02:40:39.155 --> 02:40:42.037]  I thank God I got with Ted now almost 14 years ago.
[02:40:42.598 --> 02:40:48.541]  And I feel good that 10 years ago when gold was $260 an ounce that I looked at all the evidence and I thought it was good for me.
[02:40:49.022 --> 02:40:50.663]  And so I tell people what I think is good.
[02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:52.470]  And look what's happened.
[02:40:52.950 --> 02:40:57.472]  I feel good about telling folks Enron was a scam two years before it came out.
[02:40:57.872 --> 02:41:00.753]  I feel good talking about Bernie Madoff before it came out.
[02:41:01.133 --> 02:41:06.375]  I feel good, you know, just continuing to be accurate because really it's not rocket science.
[02:41:06.415 --> 02:41:08.376]  The mainstream media lies and spins.
[02:41:09.216 --> 02:41:10.837]  And they know the truth as well.
[02:41:10.857 --> 02:41:16.039]  I mean, look, the neocons knew about world government 20 years ago when they were telling you it didn't exist.
[02:41:16.119 --> 02:41:23.303]  Now they're letting you in on the big secret that there's a world government, but they're going to be the gatekeepers, and they'll tell you what's a conspiracy theory and what isn't.
[02:41:23.563 --> 02:41:24.323]  Come on, folks.
[02:41:24.783 --> 02:41:29.826]  Look, you've done your own research out there, and we're spot on with what we've put out and what we've said.
[02:41:30.066 --> 02:41:33.167]  Let's go to Ed in Louisiana, then Woody, Taylor, Brian, David, and others.
[02:41:33.247 --> 02:41:34.328]  Ed, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:41:35.376 --> 02:41:37.038]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:41:37.178 --> 02:41:39.481]  Bob, it's a pleasure speaking to both you gentlemen.
[02:41:39.841 --> 02:41:47.690]  And listen, I have been talking to people in certain circles and when I tell them about this gold frenzy and I ask them about it, they laugh at me.
[02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:50.093]  They tell me that people are being tricked.
[02:41:50.393 --> 02:41:50.673]  We're good.
[02:42:12.356 --> 02:42:13.977]  The world economy crashes.
[02:42:14.337 --> 02:42:16.939]  Are you going to want earrings and necklaces for your children?
[02:42:16.959 --> 02:42:18.480]  Or are you going to want food and water?
[02:42:18.820 --> 02:42:26.084]  If you keep buying and selling gold, you're keeping the same gangster gangsters that are going to crash this world economy in power.
[02:42:26.425 --> 02:42:27.705]  You keep doing that.
[02:42:28.786 --> 02:42:33.107]  I'm going to let you counter, and I'm glad you called, but let me be specific here.
[02:42:33.247 --> 02:42:46.170]  I heard that when gold was $260, announced $300, $400, $500, $600, $700, $800, $900, $1,000, $1,100, $1,200, $1,300, and people then say they could come and confiscate it like $33.
[02:42:46.250 --> 02:42:47.590]  Well, most people didn't turn it in.
[02:42:47.610 --> 02:42:51.431]  They could come and take your kids today if you let them.
[02:42:52.371 --> 02:42:57.412]  Italy suspended naked body scanners yesterday and is pulling them out because of mass revolt.
[02:42:58.152 --> 02:43:03.534]  Now do we have, you know, the same machismo or whatever it is the Italians have got?
[02:43:03.994 --> 02:43:07.336]  I mean, are Americans as good as the Italians?
[02:43:07.376 --> 02:43:09.276]  I know the Italians actually don't put up with a lot of bull.
[02:43:10.437 --> 02:43:12.738]  We're about to get the naked body scanners removed.
[02:43:12.758 --> 02:43:13.718]  They're in deep trouble.
[02:43:14.018 --> 02:43:15.199]  The airlines don't want them.
[02:43:15.659 --> 02:43:16.899]  It's admitted they're saving the image.
[02:43:16.959 --> 02:43:18.200]  Now you're saying, what's that got to do with gold?
[02:43:18.980 --> 02:43:21.522]  Well, I mean, we have to say no to this.
[02:43:21.742 --> 02:43:24.163]  Of course they can manipulate gold down the road.
[02:43:24.183 --> 02:43:25.564]  They're doing it right now.
[02:43:25.844 --> 02:43:27.005]  They're trying to suppress it.
[02:43:27.105 --> 02:43:28.266]  They're demonizing it.
[02:43:28.646 --> 02:43:33.750]  They're having congressional hearings with the people supported by the Federal Reserve, with Weiner and others.
[02:43:34.330 --> 02:43:34.830]  Let me finish.
[02:43:34.910 --> 02:43:36.972]  I'm going to get Bob's take and then you'll get your take, Ed.
[02:43:37.192 --> 02:43:39.413]  But you threw all this out and you're full of adrenaline.
[02:43:39.453 --> 02:43:39.913]  That's fine.
[02:43:40.874 --> 02:43:41.675]  The globalists
[02:43:42.874 --> 02:43:48.055]  Are buying up a lot of gold because they understand that they've sold all these derivatives.
[02:43:48.135 --> 02:43:48.955]  Is gold perfect?
[02:43:49.035 --> 02:43:49.315]  No.
[02:43:49.415 --> 02:43:50.196]  Is silver perfect?
[02:43:50.236 --> 02:43:50.496]  No.
[02:43:50.636 --> 02:43:56.337]  But more gold's being sold every year now than can be mined, than they can find.
[02:43:56.917 --> 02:43:57.197]  Okay?
[02:43:57.477 --> 02:44:00.358]  Gold is devalued from where it should be.
[02:44:00.458 --> 02:44:03.498]  This is really, I agree with the Kaiser, a bear market.
[02:44:03.738 --> 02:44:05.599]  We haven't even seen the bull yet.
[02:44:05.639 --> 02:44:07.199]  It should be $2,500 or more for 1980 adjusted inflation.
[02:44:07.219 --> 02:44:07.319]  Okay?
[02:44:11.860 --> 02:44:16.544]  We've been right all along, and then we have arguments, you know, should we have a gold-backed currency?
[02:44:16.564 --> 02:44:18.045]  Should we not have a gold-backed currency?
[02:44:18.425 --> 02:44:23.770]  I've had both groups on to promote both perspectives, but it is sheer lunacy.
[02:44:24.530 --> 02:44:27.413]  I get these emails that, you know, that I'm bad because I'm
[02:44:28.013 --> 02:44:29.074]  Okay, I'm bad.
[02:44:29.114 --> 02:44:32.897]  I told listeners at 260 to get gold and it just hit 1300.
[02:44:33.097 --> 02:44:36.941]  I'm bad that I said they're going to blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[02:44:37.521 --> 02:44:43.986]  I'm bad because I said that the Copenhagen Treaty was going to be shot down because we got those emails.
[02:44:44.827 --> 02:44:48.328]  People for two weeks said it was fake, that I had the MIAC report.
[02:44:48.649 --> 02:44:48.909]  Okay?
[02:44:49.069 --> 02:45:02.074]  Look, we're real, we have a track record, and I just don't know what to say to you when it's up 400% in the last 10 years, and a meteorite could hit the planet and kill us all tomorrow.
[02:45:02.932 --> 02:45:04.253]  You could be struck by lightning.
[02:45:04.293 --> 02:45:05.515]  I mean, anything could happen.
[02:45:06.335 --> 02:45:19.388]  But to say that this is a big setup with the banksters, the banksters are out demonizing gold, and in all their global stock market moves, trying to drive it down, but you're saying, no, they want it up.
[02:45:19.728 --> 02:45:21.250]  Bob Chapman, your comments on this.
[02:45:22.535 --> 02:45:24.196]  Well, they certainly do not want it up.
[02:45:24.616 --> 02:45:26.176]  And yes, they do own gold.
[02:45:26.957 --> 02:45:29.818]  The central banks don't own as much as they had before.
[02:45:30.278 --> 02:45:36.120]  And out of 32,000 tons, they probably get 5,000 tons left, maybe as much as 10.
[02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:37.540]  But no more than that.
[02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:40.861]  They spent more than half of it suppressing prices.
[02:45:41.542 --> 02:45:45.383]  Gold production and silver production continue to drop every year.
[02:45:45.823 --> 02:45:52.574]  Because there was no investment in... Gold is used in so many industries and silver is used.
[02:45:52.914 --> 02:45:58.082]  I've seen all the major market analysis that they're not getting enough silver for all the semiconductors.
[02:45:58.974 --> 02:46:03.557]  I mean, what is... Listen, briefly, briefly, because I've got to be fair to Woody and Taylor and Brian.
[02:46:03.577 --> 02:46:05.057]  I always keep people that disagree on longer.
[02:46:05.658 --> 02:46:06.978]  Ed, you sound so angry.
[02:46:07.339 --> 02:46:08.499]  You sound so angry.
[02:46:08.519 --> 02:46:10.280]  You know, I guess we're the New World Order.
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:11.341]  We're the bad guys here.
[02:46:11.361 --> 02:46:14.603]  I mean, are you saying people shouldn't have got gold at $260 an ounce and made a 400% profit?
[02:46:18.118 --> 02:46:19.558]  Alex, I'm not saying that at all.
[02:46:19.739 --> 02:46:28.441]  All I'm saying is, and believe you me, you have come up and you have made me aware of a lot of things by listening to you and researching what you say.
[02:46:28.921 --> 02:46:32.703]  I have been enlightened by your work.
[02:46:33.023 --> 02:46:34.003]  I have to tell you that.
[02:46:34.023 --> 02:46:35.483]  I'm not saying you're New World Order.
[02:46:35.824 --> 02:46:37.624]  I'm saying... But I'm saying you're friends.
[02:46:37.684 --> 02:46:39.885]  No, but I get these emails where...
[02:46:41.169 --> 02:46:45.572]  Where it's a globalist plan to drive up gold when they're on record and with their actions.
[02:46:46.052 --> 02:46:47.313]  Look, your friends are wrong.
[02:46:47.914 --> 02:46:49.535]  And that's all I can say.
[02:46:49.555 --> 02:46:51.416]  I appreciate your call, Ed.
[02:46:51.877 --> 02:46:55.059]  Brief response to what Ed was saying, Bob Chapman.
[02:46:58.012 --> 02:47:06.638]  All I can say is your friends better not show up at my house when they don't have any money because they didn't buy any gold and silver.
[02:47:07.498 --> 02:47:11.701]  Well, I mean, no one ever said it was going to be perfect if things completely collapse.
[02:47:12.342 --> 02:47:21.348]  And that's why we say food, guns, gold, silver, but more importantly, gardens, knowing your neighbors, having a plan.
[02:47:21.368 --> 02:47:22.969]  I mean, we cover it all.
[02:47:23.089 --> 02:47:24.250]  All we give is solutions.
[02:47:24.550 --> 02:47:27.712]  States' rights, getting active, standing up to tyranny.
[02:47:31.575 --> 02:47:34.757]  I just don't get how we've been completely right about everything, Bob.
[02:47:34.837 --> 02:47:36.578]  Frighteningly so, because we know history.
[02:47:36.798 --> 02:47:37.679]  And we know our enemy.
[02:47:41.161 --> 02:47:44.924]  But I guess it is the messengers that always get their heads chopped off, Bob.
[02:47:45.744 --> 02:47:46.525]  And that's okay.
[02:47:47.366 --> 02:47:48.867]  That is perfectly okay.
[02:47:49.607 --> 02:47:52.049]  Because our only motive here is to help people.
[02:47:52.669 --> 02:47:56.452]  And what is very disconcerting and very disappointing to me
[02:47:57.097 --> 02:48:06.159]  Is that so many others don't have the perspective that we have and understand very simply how this all happened and who is behind it.
[02:48:07.059 --> 02:48:21.822]  Well, I mean, I get this all day that I'm supporting a gold standard because I've had Ron Paul on with his Von Mies Institute view and I've had other groups on and I promote films like The Secret of Oz with a fiat version and I'm just, we're having a debate!
[02:48:21.962 --> 02:48:23.423]  I mean, we're having a discussion!
[02:48:25.717 --> 02:48:28.359]  It's amazing sometimes, but I'm not mad at Ed.
[02:48:28.439 --> 02:48:29.300]  I'm just frustrated.
[02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:31.201]  Let's talk to Woody in Seattle.
[02:48:31.241 --> 02:48:32.122]  Woody, you're on the air.
[02:48:32.142 --> 02:48:34.324]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[02:48:34.684 --> 02:48:44.492]  I just want to say that Bob Chapman, Gerald Celente, and Peter Schiff have been my three economic advisors for the last couple of years, and those guys have saved me.
[02:48:45.713 --> 02:48:46.594]  I'm retired now.
[02:48:47.333 --> 02:48:51.416]  And my question to Bob is... You know how many cops have sent me letters?
[02:48:52.356 --> 02:49:03.263]  I mean, I don't want to get into the whole story, but one of the cops that sent me the MIAC report said that all of the state police in his group are totally into the show now.
[02:49:03.303 --> 02:49:03.743]  You know why?
[02:49:04.023 --> 02:49:08.186]  He convinced them six years ago to start buying gold, and they're all making giant profits.
[02:49:08.546 --> 02:49:10.007]  See, that'll get somebody's attention.
[02:49:10.047 --> 02:49:10.688]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:49:11.708 --> 02:49:12.028]  That's okay.
[02:49:12.048 --> 02:49:15.891]  I was one of the guys that got hired before they instituted the low IQ requirement.
[02:49:16.932 --> 02:49:19.494]  Oh, so you're an officer too?
[02:49:20.494 --> 02:49:22.035]  I'm retired, 25 years.
[02:49:24.197 --> 02:49:27.019]  Bob, where's the sovereign debt crisis going?
[02:49:27.039 --> 02:49:34.263]  I know it's out of the news now, I know it hasn't gone away, and where do you see that leading in the next 12 months?
[02:49:34.283 --> 02:49:35.564]  Do you see it re-emerging?
[02:49:35.604 --> 02:49:38.506]  Do you see it coming back in the spotlight?
[02:49:39.066 --> 02:49:44.290]  And if so, where is it going to take us with regards to gold and our currency?
[02:49:45.177 --> 02:49:49.079]  Are you referring to Greece and the others that are in trouble over in Europe?
[02:49:49.319 --> 02:49:49.820]  The pigs!
[02:49:49.880 --> 02:49:50.380]  That's right.
[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:51.380]  That's right.
[02:49:51.521 --> 02:50:13.893]  Right, well, you know, it's fluid, it's ongoing, and they've had demonstrations for the last couple of weeks, particularly this past week, and I was on Greek radio again this past week, and told them, you know, what I thought, and I think, first of all, Germany says
[02:50:14.460 --> 02:50:15.881]  We're not going to put up any more money.
[02:50:16.862 --> 02:50:20.404]  Now, there's a group of nations that put up almost a trillion dollars.
[02:50:21.405 --> 02:50:22.385]  It's not going to be enough.
[02:50:23.166 --> 02:50:24.507]  They'll need three or four trillion.
[02:50:26.088 --> 02:50:28.149]  And it's not going to be forthcoming.
[02:50:28.629 --> 02:50:37.555]  So, ultimately, the sovereign nations in Europe, and then in England, and then in the United States, are all going to default.
[02:50:37.615 --> 02:50:38.296]  They have to.
[02:50:38.796 --> 02:50:40.717]  There is no way... Who do you think's next?
[02:50:40.817 --> 02:50:42.979]  I mean, is it going to start in Asia, Europe, here?
[02:50:44.540 --> 02:50:50.021]  Oh, I think it'll definitely start in Europe, in England, and then here.
[02:50:50.801 --> 02:50:52.381]  Okay, I hope that answers your question, Woody.

[02:52:04.292 --> 02:52:06.933]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:52:07.493 --> 02:52:12.254]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:12.614 --> 02:52:16.815]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:17.115 --> 02:52:19.455]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:19.475 --> 02:52:21.996]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:22.356 --> 02:52:24.916]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:25.257 --> 02:52:32.858]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:33.198 --> 02:52:38.459]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:38.479 --> 02:52:41.340]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:41.440 --> 02:52:44.861]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:45.121 --> 02:52:46.021]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:46.041 --> 02:52:47.502]  You're everyone else.

[02:53:16.945 --> 02:53:18.706]  They are expensive payment plans.

[02:54:02.372 --> 02:54:04.673]  Here's a brief little news blip.
[02:54:05.373 --> 02:54:08.854]  Romanian police joined demonstrations against austerity plans.
[02:54:09.294 --> 02:54:11.275]  Same thing in Spain, same thing in Greece.
[02:54:12.035 --> 02:54:17.157]  As soon as the cops figure out they're with the people, we bring down the New World Order.
[02:54:17.777 --> 02:54:25.079]  There's plenty of resources, plenty of jobs, plenty of money, if we didn't have the globalists who openly want to destroy the economy to make us dependent on them.
[02:54:25.780 --> 02:54:28.921]  Let's talk to Taylor in New Mexico.
[02:54:29.021 --> 02:54:29.961]  Taylor, you're on the air.
[02:54:31.826 --> 02:54:32.306]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:32.326 --> 02:54:32.807]  Hi, Bob.
[02:54:32.847 --> 02:54:34.748]  Y'all are a beacon of light in a dark world.
[02:54:34.768 --> 02:54:36.450]  I like what y'all are doing for us.
[02:54:37.551 --> 02:54:40.433]  I just wanted to ask Bob a couple of questions.
[02:54:40.453 --> 02:54:41.574]  Well, two real quick questions.
[02:54:42.154 --> 02:54:59.668]  One, you know, as the economy gets worse and as gold rises and, you know, as this whole, you know, situation degrades itself, are there any certain commodities that we should be looking at as well, you know, their increase as well as gold, you know, against the waning decline of the dollar?
[02:55:00.488 --> 02:55:01.029]  And second,
[02:55:01.767 --> 02:55:12.194]  I have a father who owns a sheet metal, aluminum manufacturing business, manufactures like metal panels and stuff like that, and they get all of their steel from either Mexico, China, overseas, you know, that sort of thing.
[02:55:12.214 --> 02:55:16.036]  A dropping dollar should help him because he'll, more manufacturing will happen.
[02:55:16.056 --> 02:55:17.397]  That's the one silver lining.
[02:55:17.437 --> 02:55:18.618]  Was that your question?
[02:55:19.638 --> 02:55:20.059]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:20.319 --> 02:55:24.381]  Okay, Bob, a quick answer please, sir.
[02:55:24.421 --> 02:55:29.064]  The first part of it, well, I get sidetracked on the second part because I started thinking about other things.
[02:55:29.084 --> 02:55:30.065]  The first part was
[02:55:31.260 --> 02:55:33.041]  What was the first one?
[02:55:33.322 --> 02:55:36.364]  Looking at different commodities versus the dollar.
[02:55:36.384 --> 02:55:37.805]  Oh, I got the answer for you.
[02:55:38.265 --> 02:55:43.690]  First of all, oil and petrochemical products are dicey.
[02:55:44.310 --> 02:55:45.931]  And so where do you go?
[02:55:46.131 --> 02:55:49.154]  You go to the food, the softs and the beans.
[02:55:49.850 --> 02:55:54.112]  You go to corn, wheat, soybeans.
[02:55:54.553 --> 02:55:56.153]  No Russian wheat exports this year.
[02:55:56.193 --> 02:55:57.634]  That should drive wheat up, right?
[02:55:58.174 --> 02:55:58.835]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:55:58.855 --> 02:56:03.217]  How about when they get the worst drought in 47 years in Brazil?
[02:56:03.237 --> 02:56:05.999]  I mean, that is a big producer.
[02:56:06.659 --> 02:56:09.701]  And, of course, coffee as well will be cut back.
[02:56:10.161 --> 02:56:13.022]  But go into the food items.
[02:56:13.443 --> 02:56:15.884]  And I've been recommending that since the beginning of the year.
[02:56:16.403 --> 02:56:20.945]  And the reason I did is I had farmers come to me who were subscribers and they said, what do I do?
[02:56:20.986 --> 02:56:22.967]  I get silos full of this stuff.
[02:56:23.407 --> 02:56:27.689]  And I said, you hold on to it in the summer and into the fall, the prices will be much higher.
[02:56:28.389 --> 02:56:29.990]  And fortunately, I was right again.
[02:56:30.010 --> 02:56:31.431]  Oh, right again.
[02:56:31.491 --> 02:56:32.632]  That's why you're so evil.
[02:56:35.133 --> 02:56:36.494]  No devil tree for you now.
[02:56:38.547 --> 02:56:40.348]  They just hate us because we're so right, Bob.
[02:56:40.968 --> 02:56:42.368]  God bless you, Taylor.
[02:56:42.489 --> 02:56:43.849]  One more and I'm sorry to David and Jim.
[02:56:43.869 --> 02:56:45.330]  We'll go to Brian in South Carolina.
[02:56:45.550 --> 02:56:46.650]  You're our tail gunner, Brian.
[02:56:46.670 --> 02:56:47.530]  Hit us and hit us hard.
[02:56:48.791 --> 02:56:50.351]  Hey Alex, hey Bob.
[02:56:50.732 --> 02:56:51.852]  First question's for Bob.
[02:56:52.432 --> 02:56:57.914]  Do you think that the demand for silver and gold increases or decreases the price of gasoline?
[02:56:57.934 --> 02:56:59.335]  I just wanted to get your opinion on that.
[02:56:59.475 --> 02:57:01.316]  Well that's a controlled mega cartel.
[02:57:01.336 --> 02:57:01.996]  That's what he just said.
[02:57:02.036 --> 02:57:02.596]  It's dicey.
[02:57:02.836 --> 02:57:04.657]  But generally it's an uptrend, correct Bob?
[02:57:06.024 --> 02:57:10.466]  Well, I think platinum is used in the cracking process, is it not?
[02:57:11.546 --> 02:57:13.767]  I'm not sure about... Gasoline?
[02:57:13.787 --> 02:57:14.547]  I'm not sure.
[02:57:15.928 --> 02:57:23.791]  But other than that, platinum and palladium, they operate on their own and they've done quite well, quite frankly.
[02:57:24.351 --> 02:57:25.972]  In fact, better than silver and gold have.
[02:57:26.272 --> 02:57:29.013]  And the main reason is that they're not suppressed by government.
[02:57:30.393 --> 02:57:31.394]  Anything else, Brian?
[02:57:32.327 --> 02:57:35.288]  Yeah, well, one more question for Bob, and then I've got one quick one for you.
[02:57:36.229 --> 02:57:42.972]  I guess where I'm coming from is, as you see, people begin to choose and juggle the two different options as far as currency.
[02:57:42.992 --> 02:57:53.356]  When they look at gold, silver, and dollars and all of these things, what I was thinking was, you know, what effect does that have on the value of silver compared to the dollar, compared to the price of gas?
[02:57:53.396 --> 02:57:54.737]  Because you can see sometimes
[02:57:55.342 --> 02:58:00.467]  You know, the price of gasoline, it almost seems, is what is holding our economy together.
[02:58:00.508 --> 02:58:02.369]  That's what we're using to back the currency.
[02:58:02.410 --> 02:58:07.255]  Well, generally, when other commodities go up, you'll see fuel go up, but Bob, is that correct?
[02:58:08.536 --> 02:58:09.177]  That's correct.
[02:58:09.757 --> 02:58:17.025]  And don't forget, if gold and silver are going up, if gasoline stays the same, or even if it goes up, it's not going to go up
[02:58:17.586 --> 02:58:20.008]  At least in the last 10 years, that's what we've learned.
[02:58:20.348 --> 02:58:24.292]  It's not going to go up more than what the value of your gold and silver are.
[02:58:24.312 --> 02:58:25.112]  Yeah, I'm out of time.
[02:58:25.152 --> 02:58:26.533]  Brian, what was your quick question for me?
[02:58:26.553 --> 02:58:28.095]  It's this.
[02:58:28.155 --> 02:58:30.196]  You were talking about fluoride in the water.
[02:58:30.957 --> 02:58:31.998]  I've got a theory on that.
[02:58:32.058 --> 02:58:38.563]  I feel like our bodies are being fluoridated because they're planning on depolymerizing all these bodies.
[02:58:38.583 --> 02:58:39.184]  We're out of time!
[02:58:39.204 --> 02:58:42.927]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:43.646 --> 02:58:44.787]  See you back Sunday, folks.
[02:58:44.807 --> 02:58:46.248]  4 p.m.
