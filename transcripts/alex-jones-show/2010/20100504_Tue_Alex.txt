[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.511]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for joining us today.
[00:00:05.111 --> 00:00:16.076]  We are going to be joined here in a moment via video Skype from Hawaii with Mike Rivera, who is a Genesis Radio host and also has the excellent news website WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:21.598]  Again, if you're just joining us, I'm Alex Jones with PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:36.000]  There has been an arrest that has been made of a Faisal Shahzad, who reportedly is a naturalized citizen who had traveled back to Pakistan.
[00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:47.490]  And they're saying that he may be behind, he's the main suspect in the failed Mayday truck bomb in Times Square in New York City.
[00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:54.912]  Now the issue here is we have seen the federal government stage other events in the past.
[00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:57.942]  That's just another example of the history of this.
[00:00:58.062 --> 00:00:59.323]  We know on 7-7
[00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:32.462]  There was a drill being run in London of the exact same trains and exact same bus being bombed at the exact same time.
[00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:39.067]  We know there were drills in Oklahoma City, drills on 9-11.
[00:01:39.447 --> 00:01:44.630]  We know that there have been drills in and around staged events in almost every case.
[00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:51.575]  Witnesses reported this and the police later admitted it to the fire department that in Austin they had their biggest county-wide drill ever.
[00:01:53.496 --> 00:02:00.265]  In the parking lot next door to the Echelon building that supposedly Joe Stack flew his plane into.
[00:02:00.726 --> 00:02:02.829]  Multiple witnesses said there was no one in the plane.
[00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.133]  Multiple witnesses said the FBI was already out there on the street.
[00:02:06.534 --> 00:02:07.735]  And that was later confirmed.
[00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:10.679]  And so there was a drill going on that day of some type.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:20.603]  We need to investigate this development with CBS News and this sheriff's deputy who was there, part of some type of training.
[00:02:21.044 --> 00:02:24.945]  Let's watch this clip and then go to Mike Rivero and get his take on it.
[00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:26.165]  Here it is.
[00:02:26.966 --> 00:02:30.987]  County Sheriff Mike Scott was in Times Square the night of the attempted attack.
[00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:32.948]  He talked to Wink News today about what happened.
[00:02:33.982 --> 00:02:36.525]  Somebody asked me why I didn't start taking pictures of the car.
[00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:38.807]  I was not in tourist mode at that time.
[00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:40.328]  I was in cop mode.
[00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:44.993]  You just sort of sense the danger.
[00:02:46.234 --> 00:02:54.182]  Scott says he had just been with the New York City Bomb Squad for training earlier in the day, but had no idea they'd be called to work, in this case, just hours.
[00:02:55.748 --> 00:02:57.670]  And I guess the clip cuts out early there.
[00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.631]  We need to find that full clip.
[00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:03.815]  I know we were sent that clip by a listener, but we need to try to find the full clip.
[00:03:04.736 --> 00:03:11.321]  So the way that appears is that he was there for training with the bomb squad.
[00:03:11.902 --> 00:03:17.666]  I mean, he said, I was there for training with the bomb squad just a few hours before, and then he was in cop mode
[00:03:18.547 --> 00:03:24.835]  As part of that training in Times Square, and then you have the almost instant response of the bomb squad.
[00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:27.058]  And that's not saying the bomb squad was in on this.
[00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:36.209]  Government intelligence agencies will have other agencies involved in drills, so that when the NSA picks up chatter about an attack,
[00:03:38.812 --> 00:03:46.099]  It's missed because this fog of the drill, of this confusion, has been injected.
[00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:51.383]  And we know this is the case on 9-11, 7-7, and so many other cases.
[00:03:51.524 --> 00:04:03.755]  Separately, and we'll play this clip again coming up in a few minutes, we have Mayor Bloomberg yesterday on the nightly news, on CBS News, nationally, saying that if he had to bet, he would guess it was some anti-government health care.
[00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:04.655]  I think?
[00:04:26.616 --> 00:04:27.656]  Thank you for having me.
[00:04:48.444 --> 00:05:05.286]  Well, you know, you pointed out a very cogent observation there with Michael Bloomberg's comments here, because looking at what I like to call the sideshow that is going on surrounding this event, everybody in politics and the media seems to be viewing every news event
[00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:15.436]  No matter what it is, not as another situation of finding out what the facts and truth are, but as merely another opportunity to propagandize whatever their agenda happens to be.
[00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:22.863]  When this fizzled bombing first came out, we had Sight Intelligence Group saying they had a video from Al-Qaeda claiming responsibility.
[00:05:23.243 --> 00:05:27.067]  Then it was being blamed on Muslim anger against South Park.
[00:05:27.447 --> 00:05:33.109]  For one of their programs because this bomb was supposedly near the offices of Viacom.
[00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.030]  Then you had Bloomberg saying it was probably somebody that was opposed to health care.
[00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.731]  Other groups are saying it was probably the Tea Party activists.
[00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:47.453]  On and on and on you see everybody trying to grab onto this news event and spin it to support whatever their particular agenda happens to be.
[00:05:47.873 --> 00:05:56.016]  Now we're hearing basically that this perpetrator they've arrested for it apparently lost his home to foreclosure about a month ago.
[00:05:56.616 --> 00:06:19.961]  and it was basically you know would make sense he was selling his van and going back home to uh... you know basically try and get his life back together so it's kind of interesting we you know we saw this videotape of the guy taking off his sweater and and he was the white guy that was supposed to be the suspect and it just seems like we have had this continuous parade of possible suspicions and i'm not
[00:06:21.022 --> 00:06:33.180]  I'm not sure where the truth lies right now because the waters are so muddied, but it's just an interesting study in propaganda to see how this incident has been exploited by so many different people to push so many different agendas.
[00:06:34.175 --> 00:06:37.657]  Well, exactly, and it's like a catch-all.
[00:06:38.438 --> 00:06:48.625]  Just, you know, this vague, nebulous event, and now no one knows who's behind it, so we'll just blame everyone, but the good guys are the authorities.
[00:06:48.685 --> 00:06:49.626]  They're the officials.
[00:06:49.966 --> 00:06:52.327]  You just heard that video clip, Mike.
[00:06:52.708 --> 00:06:56.851]  What do you make of the sheriff's deputy
[00:06:57.771 --> 00:07:22.712]  uh... being interviewed by the news and saying yeah we were there working with the bomb squad at times square a few hours before so i was there in cop mode i don't think you can take anything away from that but that they were doing a drill we're putting calls in right now uh... to new york to the county uh... two different agencies and and that should be public information were they
[00:07:23.553 --> 00:07:50.490]  running a drill uh... in times square preceding this well i'm i'd want to be very very careful about this because listening to the clip just then it sounded like he was in new york to work with the bomb squad i didn't get that he said that the the training with the bomb squad was in times square it may have been or not it seems a little vague to me and i'd like to nail that down before we start
[00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.412]  You know, basing conclusions on it.
[00:07:54.854 --> 00:07:59.599]  But I think if he's in cop mode and he's suspicious, that's all the more reason to be taking pictures.
[00:08:00.059 --> 00:08:06.686]  So that comment about, I'm not taking pictures because I'm a cop and I'm suspicious of the guy, seems strange.
[00:08:06.706 --> 00:08:08.688]  I mean, everybody's cell phone's got a camera.
[00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:12.712]  And, you know, that struck me as kind of an odd statement.
[00:08:13.908 --> 00:08:16.151]  Yeah, no, I think it's nebulous.
[00:08:16.672 --> 00:08:17.954]  We need to get to the bottom of it.
[00:08:19.577 --> 00:08:22.922]  I had the guys rush in right at the end of the last hour and said, we've got a CBS clip.
[00:08:22.942 --> 00:08:23.883]  They were having a drill.
[00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:27.649]  And then once I watched the clip, I realized that it was a bit...
[00:08:29.713 --> 00:08:35.895]  A bit nebulous, but we need to investigate this, because if there was a drill, I mean, it's not like we're trying to blame the government out of the blue here.
[00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:39.257]  I mean, they admittedly cooked the bomb, trained the driver in 93 there.
[00:08:39.617 --> 00:08:42.098]  But we know they're covering up in New York what happened on 9-11.
[00:08:42.438 --> 00:08:50.561]  We know they covered up the fact that they blew up Building 7, and now they're admitting, well, we were looking at blowing it up, but we didn't, because it just fell on its own for us at free-fall speeds.
[00:08:50.941 --> 00:08:51.981]  Mike Rivera, stay there.
[00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:56.003]  Let's continue on a host of issues on the other side, including what's happening in Arizona.
[00:08:57.137 --> 00:09:02.445]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:09:02.485 --> 00:09:05.209]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:09:05.249 --> 00:09:09.735]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[00:10:57.293 --> 00:10:58.134]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:10:58.314 --> 00:11:03.661]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:11:03.841 --> 00:11:04.261]  I get it.
[00:11:04.402 --> 00:11:13.733]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:11:13.993 --> 00:11:15.194]  That's not what's happening.
[00:11:15.414 --> 00:11:23.658]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:27.140]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.363]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:11:31.543 --> 00:11:33.124]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:11:33.144 --> 00:11:36.386]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:11:36.546 --> 00:11:40.708]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:11:40.908 --> 00:11:41.649]  You should, too.
[00:11:41.809 --> 00:11:42.770]  Find out what they know.

[00:11:46.673 --> 00:11:46.853]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:47.614]  Let's talk tough.
[00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:48.534]  Let's talk comfort.
[00:12:00.649 --> 00:12:02.750]  Let's talk about down-home value.
[00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.550]  Made in the USA, blue jeans.
[00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.651]  Like you wore as a kid.
[00:12:07.971 --> 00:12:08.431]  Remember?

[00:12:38.417 --> 00:12:39.718]  Every stitch guaranteed.

[00:12:49.146 --> 00:12:49.526]  Others don't.
[00:13:07.038 --> 00:13:11.380]  Okay, I know we've got Tim, Julio, Steve, Tim, Shannon, and others holding.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.961]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:17.662]  Mike Rivero is our guest.
[00:13:18.042 --> 00:13:23.784]  Next hour, I'm going to personally spend quite a bit of time on the whole illegal alien situation.
[00:13:24.164 --> 00:13:25.585]  I believe we're a nation of immigrants.
[00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:28.786]  I believe we need more immigrants to the country legally.
[00:13:29.446 --> 00:13:50.961]  But when the government brings in these groups, and then uses it to divide and conquer, and gives them all this welfare, and then makes them dependents of the state, I mean, I've looked at the voting numbers, I mean, many of the immigrant populations, almost 90% tend to vote for bigger government, gun control, and so the government is basically using them as a political weapon.
[00:13:51.001 --> 00:13:56.685]  Now I look at the Arizona law, it's questionable whether it's constitutional, but then what does Arizona do
[00:13:57.546 --> 00:14:01.067]  When they're beginning to collapse in Southern Arizona, just like Mexico is.
[00:14:01.407 --> 00:14:05.069]  Mexico is a failed state because of their phony drug war.
[00:14:05.089 --> 00:14:08.110]  20 plus thousand deaths in the last two years alone.
[00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.410]  They're in a serious crisis.
[00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.391]  Mike Rivera, where do you see this going?
[00:14:13.484 --> 00:14:21.389]  Well, I agree that, again, various politicians and political groups are trying to exploit the situation for their own immediate political gain.
[00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:36.419]  One of the issues that I have about this sudden flare-up of the Arizona law and the reaction to it... I mean, the Arizona law really is just a state implementation of existing federal law and a promise of more rigid enforcement, which the federal government has been sort of lax in doing.
[00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:41.943]  But I think one of the reasons they're trying to fan this up as an issue is, as we head into this election season,
[00:14:42.543 --> 00:14:54.770]  This is the issue we're going to see more and more politicians campaigning on, rather than to allow any discussions about the economy or the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and wherever else to come to the fore.
[00:14:55.190 --> 00:15:10.118]  And we've seen this in years past as an ongoing pattern, where the politicians will decide, we're going to run the campaigns on this issue over here, because nobody dares talk about these really important things that are affecting everybody's lives over here.
[00:15:10.498 --> 00:15:18.661]  And so I think one of the reasons we're seeing such a furor whip up about this thing is again to take the heat off of the economy and the wars.
[00:15:19.021 --> 00:15:31.125]  Now one thing I did note is that over this last weekend when we had these pro-illegal immigration rallies, we've seen videotapes of the rioting that took place in Arizona when the law was passed.
[00:15:31.385 --> 00:15:38.267]  Over this last weekend there was vandalism and damage up in Santa Cruz for which the corporate media has basically turned a blind eye.
[00:15:38.707 --> 00:15:47.853]  If it had been the Tea Party in Santa Cruz breaking windows and damaging retail establishments, I think it would have been headline news across the country.
[00:15:48.733 --> 00:15:59.800]  I mean, let's face it, the immigration riots in Santa Cruz did more real physical damage than this bomb in Times Square, and yet the bomb in Times Square is getting the headline news.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:00.660]  That's right.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:07.983]  I mean, to be specific, they had burning torches and set fire to a restaurant with people in it who had to escape.
[00:16:08.383 --> 00:16:10.404]  I mean, that is an act of attempted murder.
[00:16:10.704 --> 00:16:17.947]  And then the local ABC News channel interviewed two people who agreed with the rioters and said they have a reason to be upset.
[00:16:18.507 --> 00:16:31.452]  And so these illegal alien groups and their supporters feel like they're righteous and so not only is the national media blacking this out, local media is egging it on like this was George Washington and the Tea Party.
[00:16:31.832 --> 00:16:43.277]  Meanwhile, they're claiming that Oath Keepers, myself, Ron Paul, many others, yourself and some of the documents are basically terrorist enablers and that we want all this violence when we're doing
[00:16:44.502 --> 00:16:54.294]  The opposite, they've tried to keep Hispanics, Blacks and Asians from joining the Tea Parties by saying it's racial in the last year and a half, when it never had anything to do with that.
[00:16:54.554 --> 00:16:57.038]  So we see this divide and conquer taking shape.
[00:16:58.086 --> 00:17:16.706]  Well, my main concern, of course, is that following the riots that took place in Arizona, and we started seeing Obama talking about coming in and intervening and interfering with the Arizona law, my concern is that if there is any interference in the Arizona law after the rioting took place, the message that will be received is that rioting works.
[00:17:17.347 --> 00:17:26.915]  And people all across the country are going to be looking at what happened with, oh, they riot in Arizona, they get the immigration bill overturned by the federal government, they're going to say, well, let's riot for what we want.
[00:17:26.975 --> 00:17:28.556]  Tax is too high, let's have a riot.
[00:17:29.237 --> 00:17:30.678]  Don't like the wars, let's riot.
[00:17:30.698 --> 00:17:35.181]  Let me stop you, absolutely key, what did Obama do when he was a U.S.
[00:17:35.201 --> 00:17:38.904]  Senator with Odingo, we have the emails, they're public, he told his cousin,
[00:17:39.645 --> 00:18:02.775]  Burn buildings, attack, the Muslim minority did not win the election so they created a prime ministership along with the president for Odinga so he would stop burning down churches and so exactly the media is saying you burn things down as our political army and we'll protect you and not talk about it but then we'll blame the Tea Parties and claim they're burning things down when it never happened.
[00:18:03.806 --> 00:18:04.426]  Yeah, it is.
[00:18:04.506 --> 00:18:08.008]  It's manufactured terror, and it's going to be put onto a scapegoat.
[00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:14.691]  It's Nazi tactics all over again, and they're turning it basically against those of us who want to restore the Republic.
[00:18:15.872 --> 00:18:20.894]  Well, we're going to go bankrupt if we don't stem the tide of illegal immigration.
[00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:22.415]  I mean, that's why Rome fell.
[00:18:22.975 --> 00:18:31.739]  And it'd be one thing if there wasn't welfare for these people, and if we, you know, taught them about the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, they'd join the Freedom Tribe, because we're all tribal.
[00:18:32.219 --> 00:18:35.542]  So we better have a tribe of freedom and liberty and get past skin color.
[00:18:35.882 --> 00:18:39.465]  But if we don't do that, then we've got to kick these people out.
[00:18:39.505 --> 00:18:40.686]  We've got to shut the borders down.
[00:18:40.946 --> 00:18:43.047]  Because the globalists are using them as a political weapon.
[00:18:43.308 --> 00:18:44.128]  Great points, Mike.
[00:18:44.188 --> 00:18:44.529]  Stay there.
[00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:46.550]  We're going to come back, talk about this and other subjects.
[00:18:47.091 --> 00:18:47.971]  We're on the march.
[00:18:48.472 --> 00:18:50.073]  The empire's on the run.
[00:18:51.014 --> 00:18:53.676]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:19:59.517 --> 00:20:04.479]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:20:04.839 --> 00:20:06.580]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.702]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:20:11.882 --> 00:20:12.862]  How much do you want?
[00:20:13.082 --> 00:20:13.822]  When do you want it?
[00:20:14.203 --> 00:20:15.803]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:20:16.083 --> 00:20:16.904]  When will you need it?
[00:20:17.164 --> 00:20:19.224]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:20:19.364 --> 00:20:20.405]  Will there be any food?
[00:20:20.725 --> 00:20:24.607]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[00:20:24.767 --> 00:20:27.288]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:20:27.488 --> 00:20:30.670]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.572]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:20:34.892 --> 00:20:35.873]  How much will you need?
[00:20:36.113 --> 00:20:36.713]  We don't know.
[00:20:37.013 --> 00:20:37.934]  How much do you want?
[00:20:38.134 --> 00:20:38.854]  All you can get.
[00:20:39.054 --> 00:20:39.915]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:40.155 --> 00:20:42.916]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:20:43.196 --> 00:20:44.957]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.901]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:56.865]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:56.905 --> 00:21:02.249]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:07.113]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:21:07.514 --> 00:21:12.538]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:21:13.078 --> 00:21:17.781]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:21:18.302 --> 00:21:20.223]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:21:20.603 --> 00:21:25.226]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:21:25.406 --> 00:21:26.307]  And here's the best part.
[00:21:26.527 --> 00:21:29.309]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:21:29.609 --> 00:21:32.911]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:21:33.232 --> 00:21:36.053]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:21:36.414 --> 00:21:38.295]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:21:38.635 --> 00:21:39.556]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:21:43.198 --> 00:21:44.961]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:21:47.424 --> 00:21:51.950]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.654]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:22:01.206 --> 00:22:04.209]  We're going back to Mike Rivero here in just a moment and your phone calls.
[00:22:04.229 --> 00:22:07.792]  I want to get into the distractions he's talking about.
[00:22:08.252 --> 00:22:09.974]  Sure, the oil spill's a big deal.
[00:22:10.054 --> 00:22:12.716]  It's important, especially to people in Florida and the Gulf Coast.
[00:22:13.377 --> 00:22:20.063]  But it's being used as a distraction as they try to pass cap-and-trade, as they try to pass open borders, as they try to pass, more importantly,
[00:22:21.226 --> 00:22:28.488]  The banking reform bill that gives the mega banks total control over the financial system tracks everything you do, live time in your bank account.
[00:22:28.828 --> 00:22:32.649]  It's not enough that the Feds already have access, now by law they're going to be in your bank account.
[00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:48.032]  Anti-Second Amendment legislation going on, all these Supreme Court vacancies coming up, all of these incredibly central issues are being ignored, and the public formation of world government being announced in Forbes and AP to be run by the banks,
[00:22:49.315 --> 00:22:54.856]  That is not on the front burner, or even the back burner, or the latest bailout of Greece, which is just a payoff to banks.
[00:22:55.236 --> 00:22:56.376]  That is not being discussed.
[00:22:56.436 --> 00:23:12.499]  Now, I've made two films last year, Obama Deception and Fall of the Republic, that chronicle all of what the banking cartel is doing, the police state they're setting up, how they're preparing to demonize conservatives and libertarians and anybody who's against globalization.
[00:23:12.899 --> 00:23:14.500]  Those films are so important.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.320]  You may know all about the New World Order.
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.901]  A lot of you know more than I do.
[00:23:18.421 --> 00:23:20.844]  But your friends, your family, your neighbors, they don't.
[00:23:21.164 --> 00:23:22.825]  And they're ready to be awakened now.
[00:23:23.045 --> 00:23:25.347]  There has never been an awakening this big happening.
[00:23:25.728 --> 00:23:29.811]  That's all the mainstream media covers is the awakening and how we're all a bunch of terrorists.
[00:23:30.172 --> 00:23:36.057]  They're scared, ladies and gentlemen, that we're finding out about the illegitimate banking cartel that's taken over our society.
[00:23:36.077 --> 00:23:36.978]  So I want to encourage you.
[00:23:37.498 --> 00:23:44.887]  To visit the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com and get the Obama Deception and Follow the Republic, the highest quality DVDs.
[00:23:45.187 --> 00:23:47.170]  To make copies of them and get them out to everyone you know.
[00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:51.395]  To get the new film, Police State, The Rise of FEMA, A Year in the Making.
[00:23:51.435 --> 00:23:53.477]  This proves the FEMA camps.
[00:23:54.446 --> 00:24:02.551]  Existence, how they want to roll these things out, how they're militarizing the police, how they're selling the public on the end of Posse Comitatus, the executive orders.
[00:24:03.151 --> 00:24:04.312]  People need to see this.
[00:24:04.472 --> 00:24:08.995]  I mean, they need to know in this two-hour, 20-plus minute film what's really going on.
[00:24:09.015 --> 00:24:15.159]  If they watch this film and the extras, they will basically have a master's degree in the police state takeover.
[00:24:15.519 --> 00:24:18.461]  My 16 years of research, my 15 years on air,
[00:24:19.441 --> 00:24:28.496]  All the latest information, the latest false flag terror attacks, like the underwear bomber, the naked body scanners, it's all in this film, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:24:28.716 --> 00:24:33.104]  And of course, Jason Bermas' new film, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[00:24:34.335 --> 00:24:36.516]  I mean, this film is just indescribable.
[00:24:36.556 --> 00:24:37.276]  It covers it all.
[00:24:37.356 --> 00:24:50.081]  Government narcotics trafficking, white slavery, how they blackmail the gay members of Congress and the callboy rings, and how the CIA and COG system has taken over America.
[00:24:50.401 --> 00:24:51.741]  This film is getting rave reviews.
[00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:58.424]  It's available with the expanded extras on DVD at InfoWars.com or you can watch the live slash TV radio show
[00:24:59.424 --> 00:25:03.107]  When you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, read my book, Paul Watson's book, that are both out of print.
[00:25:03.967 --> 00:25:17.357]  Thousands and thousands of interviews, six plus years of operation, 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month, and it is your purchases, it is your membership, it is your support of the show that allows us to continue and to operate.
[00:25:17.557 --> 00:25:26.239]  You can also call toll free 888-253-3139 and basically it's like a donation when you buy the books and videos and t-shirts and material.
[00:25:26.559 --> 00:25:30.661]  But then the materials are also key tools in educating people.
[00:25:31.021 --> 00:25:32.361]  So 888-253-3139 or you can write to me P.O.
[00:25:32.401 --> 00:25:32.921]  Box 19549 Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:25:33.041 --> 00:25:35.522]  And I want to thank you all for your support in the Info War.
[00:25:43.524 --> 00:25:45.104]  You're the reason we've had so much success.
[00:25:45.385 --> 00:25:46.565]  Okay, going back to Mike Rivera.
[00:25:46.585 --> 00:25:51.306]  I want to go to calls, Mike, but I wanted, and I haven't even asked you, but I want to see what you think is important.
[00:25:51.706 --> 00:25:53.027]  Any other political issues?
[00:25:53.087 --> 00:25:53.987]  Any other items?
[00:25:54.387 --> 00:25:56.608]  Things that the media isn't focusing on?
[00:25:56.668 --> 00:25:58.688]  Things you think we should be focusing on?
[00:25:59.209 --> 00:26:00.189]  Things that you're concerned about?
[00:26:01.345 --> 00:26:16.248]  Well, my major concern on a global scale as we watch the situation unfold in Greece is that so far, everybody's solution to every problem in government is to basically take more money away from the people and to simply move it around.
[00:26:16.688 --> 00:26:23.269]  And because of the very nature of the reserve banking system, the problem is that people are running out of money to tax.
[00:26:23.289 --> 00:26:26.130]  In fact, there was an article we ran this morning over at WhatReallyHappened.com
[00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:52.523]  where california is bemoaning the fact that because their state tax revenues have fallen despite numerous tax increases in fact right now california is considered the most business unfriendly state in the entire country but because tax revenues continue to fall they don't see a recovery going on and what we're seeing is this kind of of willful government blindness where they still see the the american people as this vast pool of untapped capital
[00:26:53.323 --> 00:26:55.784]  That they could just go out and grab some more when they need it.
[00:26:56.145 --> 00:27:03.329]  And unfortunately, the money has become so concentrated in just a few pockets, there isn't enough money out here for commerce to be taking place.
[00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:10.592]  I'm seeing whole segments of the economy begin to shut down because everybody is holding invoices for everybody else.
[00:27:10.672 --> 00:27:11.813]  We're owed money by people.
[00:27:11.873 --> 00:27:16.376]  They can't pay us because the people who owe them can't pay them, because the people who owe them can't pay them.
[00:27:16.996 --> 00:27:21.078]  And for an economic system to be a system, money has to be flowing at all levels.
[00:27:21.198 --> 00:27:22.179]  And we've lost that.
[00:27:22.839 --> 00:27:24.780]  And our government doesn't seem to see it.
[00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:37.389]  And even worse, and this is another article we link to from WhatReallyHappened.com, it's coming out now that even as our Congress was bad-mouthing derivatives and short-selling, they were personally invested in them.
[00:27:37.709 --> 00:27:44.254]  And for those who, like me, were wondering why we didn't seem to see the government do anything to try and improve the economy as a whole,
[00:27:44.694 --> 00:27:53.822]  We're now learning, this is coming from Business Insider, that our Congress were right there with Goldman Sachs putting money in their pocket as America collapsed.
[00:27:54.363 --> 00:27:58.427]  And this is probably why they were laughing so outrageously when they pushed TARP through.
[00:27:58.707 --> 00:28:00.048]  Congress isn't the solution.
[00:28:00.128 --> 00:28:01.249]  They're part of the problem.
[00:28:01.649 --> 00:28:05.113]  They're profiting from the destruction of the American dream right now.
[00:28:05.653 --> 00:28:07.014]  And they know what they're doing.
[00:28:07.034 --> 00:28:09.496]  I mean, the biggest funders
[00:28:10.814 --> 00:28:30.606]  on record of the fake environmental movement there are real environmental issues folks get that straight but but what controls and dominates the modern environmentalist movement is a system of taking private property shutting down industry because you have the banking cartel waging war against the real economy against the individual uh...
[00:28:31.006 --> 00:28:38.471]  generation of private wealth and so they want a financial VAT, they want an overall economy-wide VAT on top of income taxes.
[00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:45.135]  Multiple states every month are passing laws to jack up taxes on food for everyone.
[00:28:45.155 --> 00:28:52.699]  They are ordering police to write more tickets while they lay off police to actually respond to crime.
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.501]  They're ordering police to only go out and generate revenue.
[00:28:55.861 --> 00:28:58.203]  So it's shifting to a pure parasite economy
[00:28:58.883 --> 00:29:03.665]  And the more they wreck the economy, the more people go on welfare, the more people are dependent.
[00:29:04.005 --> 00:29:07.386]  And so this is really a form of slavery that is taking place.
[00:29:08.366 --> 00:29:15.689]  And I guess the only silver lining here is the elites for the last three years have been moving out of Western Europe and the United States.
[00:29:16.349 --> 00:29:37.794]  uh... and and and buying armored redoubts and private security forces so that shows me they're planning to fully imploded and leave that's a little better i guess then fully imploding and sitting on top of us so it looks like it's it's it's it there's some method of the madness but it's more just a pale male uh... final looting and and and robbery that's going on
[00:29:38.732 --> 00:29:43.533]  Well, basically the problem is that we're dealing with a segment of our society who are addicted to money.
[00:29:43.893 --> 00:29:49.155]  They've already got more money than any one human could ever possibly need for an entire lifetime, but it's never enough.
[00:29:49.275 --> 00:29:58.578]  And if you really look at their behavior from the point of view of addiction, where, you know, they gotta have more than the guy next to them, they gotta have more than they had last year.
[00:29:58.838 --> 00:30:07.360]  I mean, I tell this joke about, you know, they're piling up all these notes in their living room and they take off their clothes and roll around on the money and have a really good time and everything.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.820]  But the reality is, it is addictive behavior.
[00:30:10.301 --> 00:30:14.161]  And, you know, this is why we're almost in need of an intervention here.
[00:30:14.501 --> 00:30:23.203]  Because, like any other addict, they're perfectly blind to the damage they cause to everybody around them in their quest for the next fix.
[00:30:23.803 --> 00:30:31.265]  And so, as a result, I think what's going on here, we're seeing this accumulation of complete greed, and it's part of a larger evolution.
[00:30:31.325 --> 00:30:32.765]  When this country was started,
[00:30:33.365 --> 00:30:41.130]  The founders went out of their way to avoid private central banks as any at all involved with the currency of the people.
[00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:43.132]  We've had three private central banks.
[00:30:43.572 --> 00:30:50.577]  Even so, when I was a kid, I remember it was still possible to go through your life without involving the bank except for a mortgage and or car loan.
[00:30:50.937 --> 00:30:56.881]  Now we've reached the point where the banks are trying to move so that everything you do in life has to go through them.
[00:30:57.121 --> 00:30:58.562]  They want a cashless society.
[00:30:58.782 --> 00:31:00.003]  They want everything on the plastic.
[00:31:00.283 --> 00:31:04.627]  So, everything that you do, they get a few pennies, they get a piece of the action, like the Mafia.
[00:31:05.127 --> 00:31:11.653]  And it's just this desire to absolutely have all of life go through the clutches of the banking system.
[00:31:11.953 --> 00:31:14.235]  And you're right, it is a form of slavery.
[00:31:14.495 --> 00:31:23.843]  And I think people are getting very angry about it, which is, you know, we're starting to see the expressions of outrage and rage against the banks now.
[00:31:23.883 --> 00:31:26.786]  But the government is saying in all these manuals,
[00:31:27.944 --> 00:31:31.286]  If you criticize the banks, you're a violent terrorist.
[00:31:31.386 --> 00:31:36.109]  If you criticize the bailouts, they are directly training the police and military.
[00:31:36.509 --> 00:31:39.190]  You work for Wall Street, you work for the banks.
[00:31:39.291 --> 00:31:49.817]  And I remember a professor, one of the heads of the Army War College, what was it, on C-SPAN about seven years ago, he gave a speech and said, we're setting up a new world order.
[00:31:50.777 --> 00:31:53.038]  The Pentagon works for Wall Street.
[00:31:53.118 --> 00:31:54.658]  We don't work for the American people.
[00:31:55.158 --> 00:32:05.222]  So at the highest levels of the Pentagon, this is a guy addressing generals, they are just admitting the reality of what they've done, and it's a big, sick joke to them.
[00:32:05.922 --> 00:32:15.985]  And we're going to get Rob Rash, CEO and Chief Engineer of the Levy District, made his accreditation Saturday during a candidate forum.
[00:32:16.485 --> 00:32:22.249]  And he said that he told candidates that FEMA officials told him the agency owes $20 billion to the U.S.
[00:32:22.269 --> 00:32:26.812]  Treasury, and the only way they can get it is through flood insurance premiums.
[00:32:27.252 --> 00:32:30.074]  And I'm getting calls about this in Austin and all over the country.
[00:32:30.614 --> 00:32:35.938]  People with hilltop houses are being told they've got to buy flood insurance, and FEMA's ordering them to do it.
[00:32:36.278 --> 00:32:42.222]  Just like we're being ordered to buy overpriced insurance from the insurance companies who wrote the health care bill.
[00:32:42.862 --> 00:32:57.220]  I mean, this is a mafia situation where private interests come in, lobby the government to make you buy their product, and then they're bringing in hordes of illegal aliens to menace the public into going along with this.
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.942]  I mean, this is a horrible recipe.
[00:33:00.143 --> 00:33:01.184]  It really, really is.
[00:33:01.324 --> 00:33:10.810]  And what is really sickening about this whole thing is when you understand that because the Federal Reserve is at the top of this whole corrupt pyramid, they're doing it all with counterfeit money.
[00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:15.173]  It's not like they're putting anything of real value into the pockets of the politicians.
[00:33:15.413 --> 00:33:17.494]  They simply print up whatever they need.
[00:33:17.895 --> 00:33:20.797]  It's a counterfeiting system and they've used it to subvert
[00:33:21.437 --> 00:33:22.658]  The entire U.S.
[00:33:22.718 --> 00:33:25.200]  government to their own personal corporate interests.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:29.363]  Everybody's trained to worship those little green paper notes, but that's all they are.
[00:33:29.463 --> 00:33:30.844]  Pretty printed pieces of paper.
[00:33:31.165 --> 00:33:32.966]  They don't represent real value.
[00:33:33.246 --> 00:33:35.108]  Bernanke is just printing them up as he needs them.
[00:33:35.128 --> 00:33:42.233]  And then false economy admits they are waging war against the real economy and consolidating.
[00:33:42.274 --> 00:33:44.976]  It's about power and criminal consolidation.
[00:33:45.316 --> 00:33:47.358]  And again, here is Bloomberg yesterday
[00:33:48.078 --> 00:34:00.034]  saying that it's probably somebody who's against the health care bill a nut so so you're a nut now eighty percent of the american people in major polls you are a car bomber basically is what he's saying here it is
[00:34:00.808 --> 00:34:08.834]  Law enforcement officials don't know who left the Nissan Pathfinder behind, but at this point, the mayor believes the suspect acted alone.
[00:34:09.414 --> 00:34:13.176]  If I had to guess 25 cents, this would be exactly that.
[00:34:13.637 --> 00:34:23.183]  Somebody who's homegrown, maybe a mentally deranged person or somebody with a political agenda that doesn't like the health care bill or something.
[00:34:23.203 --> 00:34:23.864]  It could be anything!
[00:34:24.525 --> 00:34:25.386]  It could be anything.
[00:34:25.486 --> 00:34:29.308]  Now, let's go to another clip from A Bug's Life that I played yesterday.
[00:34:29.328 --> 00:34:33.210]  I'm going to play this again, because this is all about intimidation.
[00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.951]  This is why the banks want to wreck the economy.
[00:34:36.291 --> 00:34:40.894]  This is why, in their own memos, they engineered it to cause the implosion.
[00:34:41.194 --> 00:34:44.596]  Because then, they're the only ones flush with bailout money.
[00:34:44.656 --> 00:34:45.916]  They shut off all the loans.
[00:34:46.197 --> 00:34:51.820]  The states, the counties, the cities, the individuals all go bankrupt, and the grasshoppers are in command.
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:52.180]  Here it is.
[00:34:53.174 --> 00:34:55.435]  There was that ant that stood up to me.
[00:34:55.655 --> 00:34:57.595]  Yeah, but we can forget about him.
[00:34:57.655 --> 00:34:59.736]  Yeah, it was just one ant.
[00:34:59.836 --> 00:35:01.576]  Ooh, one ant.
[00:35:01.636 --> 00:35:03.217]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:35:03.537 --> 00:35:05.758]  It's just one ant.
[00:35:05.838 --> 00:35:06.678]  Yeah, boss.
[00:35:06.698 --> 00:35:07.858]  They're puny.
[00:35:08.158 --> 00:35:09.319]  Hmm, puny?
[00:35:10.039 --> 00:35:14.440]  Say, let's pretend this brain is a puny little ant.
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.000]  Did that hurt?
[00:35:16.921 --> 00:35:17.581]  Nope.
[00:35:17.621 --> 00:35:18.861]  Well, how about this one?
[00:35:19.682 --> 00:35:20.562]  Are you kidding?
[00:35:21.787 --> 00:35:23.030]  Well, how about this?
[00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:28.763]  And he dumps the whole load out on them.
[00:35:35.911 --> 00:35:41.073]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[00:35:41.793 --> 00:35:46.094]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[00:35:46.574 --> 00:35:50.416]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life!
[00:35:51.236 --> 00:35:52.476]  It's not about food.
[00:35:53.136 --> 00:35:55.757]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[00:35:56.477 --> 00:35:58.018]  That's why we're going back!
[00:35:59.358 --> 00:36:01.019]  Does anybody else want to stay?
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.803]  Okay, so let's be clear what Mike brought up earlier.
[00:36:10.303 --> 00:36:23.193]  Illegal aliens attack police, set buildings on fire with people in them, run around with torches like Frankenstein or something coming up to the castle, and the media says on ABC these are good people.
[00:36:24.174 --> 00:36:26.636]  They interview people who agree with them and said they have a right to do it.
[00:36:27.157 --> 00:36:27.297]  Now,
[00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.012]  Imagine if the Tea Party did that.
[00:36:30.493 --> 00:36:32.816]  So, what do you need to know about the illegal aliens, folks?
[00:36:32.916 --> 00:36:34.859]  The media and the globalists are for them.
[00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:36.000]  That's all I need to know!
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:52.871]  And meanwhile they're saying anyone who's against the banks, oh you're just a right-wing Tea Party person to keep Hispanics and blacks and Asians from feeling like they can be with the rest of the American people against the illegitimate banking cartel that's taken over.
[00:36:52.951 --> 00:37:04.358]  And you have the media demonizing anyone who doesn't want health care as a racist to invoke racial division when we should all be together against globalist policies, period.
[00:37:04.758 --> 00:37:05.319]  They know
[00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:06.079]  What.
[00:37:06.399 --> 00:37:06.720]  They.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:07.340]  Are.
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.101]  Doing.
[00:37:08.581 --> 00:37:11.523]  And the problem is, the illegal aliens could be a great ally for freedom.
[00:37:12.244 --> 00:37:13.745]  And many of them are hard-working, good people.
[00:37:14.045 --> 00:37:18.909]  But a large portion have been taught via the federal government and Ford Foundation, that's where it started.
[00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.409]  The U.S.
[00:37:19.429 --> 00:37:23.192]  government funded this in Mexico 50 years ago, and the U.S., that the U.S.
[00:37:23.232 --> 00:37:26.715]  belongs to Mexico, the Southwest does, and that Americans are evil.
[00:37:26.755 --> 00:37:29.417]  I saw a Zogby poll where 70 plus percent
[00:37:30.257 --> 00:37:35.542]  of the immigrants from Mexico hate America, but 80 plus percent of Americans like Mexico.
[00:37:35.762 --> 00:37:37.023]  See, this is the brainwashing.
[00:37:37.503 --> 00:37:45.470]  So Mexico can be used as a weapon, not to give the Mexicans freedom, but to turn us into a corrupt plutocracy like that.
[00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:46.111]  Mike Rivera.
[00:37:47.202 --> 00:37:49.243]  Well, you know, it's rather interesting.
[00:37:49.303 --> 00:37:51.684]  It's your classic divide and conquer tactic.
[00:37:51.724 --> 00:37:53.185]  We've seen it so many years before.
[00:37:54.946 --> 00:37:57.527]  There's always a divide being imposed on our society.
[00:37:57.847 --> 00:38:01.189]  Black against white, rich against poor, young against old, men against women.
[00:38:01.209 --> 00:38:05.951]  I remember during the 1990s, this very obvious fanning of hatred between the genders.
[00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:34.833]  and uh... to me that was kind of a warning sign that our government was getting ready to launch a major campaign of wars because men were being recast as disposable in our society all the focus was put on on women in business and women as heads of household and women as the as the providers and caregivers for the family and men were being treated as disposable and was pretty obvious to me that the agenda then was somebody is getting ready to put a bunch of rifles in the hands of men and ship them off and not have the american uh... uh...
[00:38:35.513 --> 00:38:38.155]  That's right, they were neutralizing women's natural love and defense of their men.
[00:38:38.215 --> 00:38:42.277]  When families are the species, men and women, a man is the human race, a woman is the human race, we are the fusion.
[00:38:54.865 --> 00:38:59.409]  Of humanity, and they know that, so they drive that wedge in there.
[00:38:59.749 --> 00:39:01.050]  Well, it's been declassified.
[00:39:01.791 --> 00:39:02.891]  Admitted that Ms.
[00:39:02.931 --> 00:39:09.897]  Magazine was funded by the CIA to get women into the workforce so that the government could have the kids and work people to death.
[00:39:10.757 --> 00:39:12.679]  Again, it's all so cold-blooded.
[00:39:12.719 --> 00:39:15.121]  They've destroyed the natural human order.
[00:39:16.343 --> 00:39:39.328]  Well, you know, if you go back and you look at World War II, and there was that whole Rosie the Riveter campaign, and, you know, get the women into the factories so the men could go to the front lines, and then once the war was over, we saw all these TV shows like Father Knows Best, and Betty Crocker that just extolled the virtues of the woman going back into the home and being the housewife and the mother to get her out of the factory so that the returning soldiers could have jobs again.
[00:39:39.568 --> 00:39:43.449]  And it was all this very cynical manipulation of the general population.
[00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:48.576]  And I'd like to hope that Americans are now sophisticated enough to recognize when it's being done again.
[00:39:48.936 --> 00:39:49.377]  Exactly.
[00:39:49.397 --> 00:39:52.742]  And then the bankers said, look, we can have double the tax money and have their kids.
[00:39:53.342 --> 00:39:54.764]  Now, get them in the factories.
[00:39:56.963 --> 00:39:58.223]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:39:58.263 --> 00:40:03.605]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:40:03.845 --> 00:40:08.466]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:40:08.866 --> 00:40:09.267]  It's true.
[00:40:09.347 --> 00:40:13.928]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:40:14.428 --> 00:40:19.129]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:41:56.857 --> 00:41:58.517]  Oh, my sinuses!
[00:41:58.597 --> 00:42:00.338]  They feel like they'll explode!
[00:42:00.538 --> 00:42:01.198]  Sinus pressure.
[00:42:01.358 --> 00:42:03.038]  Sinus headaches that keep you up at night.
[00:42:03.118 --> 00:42:04.259]  You've struggled for years.
[00:42:04.379 --> 00:42:10.040]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:10.820]  Sound familiar?
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.800]  Well, you're not alone.
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:15.481]  Statistics show that 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress.
[00:42:15.661 --> 00:42:20.522]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.
[00:42:20.702 --> 00:42:23.142]  Now there's a solution that's safe and doctor-recommended.
[00:42:23.362 --> 00:42:25.863]  Sinofresh homeopathic antiseptic nasal spray.
[00:42:26.023 --> 00:42:26.223]  It's the
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:28.700]  Buy Synofresh today!
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:29.100]  It works!
[00:43:08.789 --> 00:43:17.935]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to a hundred and three.
[00:43:19.796 --> 00:43:21.437]  A hundred and three is forever.
[00:43:21.577 --> 00:43:24.499]  Alright, Mike Rivera's going to be with us about 15 minutes to the next hour.
[00:43:25.859 --> 00:43:31.103]  Then I'm going to try to spend some time on race-based politics and explain to new listeners
[00:43:32.253 --> 00:43:36.234]  My view on this and how the globalists are using this to control populations.
[00:43:36.274 --> 00:43:39.895]  I'm going to go to Tim Julio and others here right now.
[00:43:40.715 --> 00:43:42.595]  Again, Mike Rivero is our guest.
[00:43:42.655 --> 00:43:44.536]  Tim in Ohio, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:43:44.556 --> 00:43:45.456]  Hi, Mike.
[00:43:45.856 --> 00:43:46.096]  Alex.
[00:43:46.416 --> 00:43:46.716]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:47.116 --> 00:43:52.778]  Events over this PAC weekend were the perfect illustration of your new phrase, propaganda placement.
[00:43:53.678 --> 00:43:58.079]  You know, I worked in TV news for over 12 years, and November, July,
[00:43:58.655 --> 00:44:03.578]  February and May are sweeps months for ratings used to set the advertising prices.
[00:44:04.198 --> 00:44:09.882]  So I was always extremely suspicious of any story that breaks at the beginning of a sweeps month.
[00:44:10.342 --> 00:44:15.005]  Because all Sunday long, the news channels were just beating the drum about terror attacks.
[00:44:15.425 --> 00:44:20.989]  And then, on Sunday night, The Simpsons was about the city finding plutonium
[00:44:21.508 --> 00:44:24.811]  And suspending civil liberties, putting cameras up everywhere.
[00:44:24.831 --> 00:44:26.753]  I have a really cryptic clip.
[00:44:26.853 --> 00:44:42.027]  And I have a six minute promo video put out by News Corp bragging that they are placing propaganda in the Simpsons and the federal government is paying now openly, they were always doing it, but now openly to Brainwash.
[00:44:42.067 --> 00:44:42.447]  Go ahead.
[00:44:43.168 --> 00:44:44.309]  I got a little clip ready for it.
[00:44:44.329 --> 00:44:45.630]  It's about 60 seconds from the show.
[00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:46.111]  You want to hear it?
[00:44:46.331 --> 00:44:46.651]  Go ahead.
[00:44:48.277 --> 00:44:56.755]  This just in, the suspicious bag detonated at Springfield Union Station today contained deadly plutonium, which can only mean one thing, a terrorist plot.
[00:44:59.789 --> 00:45:00.329]  I admit it.
[00:45:00.769 --> 00:45:04.190]  Everything I've said about terrorism till now was fear-mongering.
[00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:06.591]  But today, I monger the truth.
[00:45:06.931 --> 00:45:15.614]  To protect our city from all future bombings, dirty, clean, dive, or carpet, we have hired an outside consultant from London, England.
[00:45:16.214 --> 00:45:23.236]  London is now ringed by the most comprehensive array of surveillance cameras mankind has ever seen.
[00:45:23.316 --> 00:45:24.176]  Excuse me.
[00:45:24.496 --> 00:45:27.317]  Is this what the framers of the Constitution would want?
[00:45:27.577 --> 00:45:31.498]  Well, I'm Wally of Wally's Framers, and this is exactly what I want!
[00:45:31.958 --> 00:45:36.560]  How many personal freedoms are we willing to give up in the name of security?
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.661]  That blonde girl thinks she's smart.
[00:45:39.741 --> 00:45:43.622]  Now all in favor of these cameras, say cheese!
[00:45:44.003 --> 00:45:45.023]  Cheese!
[00:45:45.383 --> 00:45:48.444]  Those opposed, say, I hate America!
[00:45:48.464 --> 00:45:51.905]  I... hate... what?
[00:45:52.826 --> 00:45:54.006]  Motion carries.
[00:45:55.273 --> 00:45:56.514]  Is that cryptic enough for you?
[00:45:56.774 --> 00:46:00.197]  Well, and it's sold like they're Ford Liberties, but what it does is condition.
[00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:00.938]  Mike Rivera.
[00:46:01.858 --> 00:46:06.722]  Yeah, it is, uh, actually I think it was quite an interesting commentary on there.
[00:46:06.742 --> 00:46:12.207]  I'm not sure it's entirely in support of surveillance cameras there with the humor involved and everything.
[00:46:12.547 --> 00:46:19.973]  But I think it does illustrate the kind of processes that are going along with trying to scare people into a certain point of view.
[00:46:20.553 --> 00:46:22.755]  Especially that last part, we're seeing that already.
[00:46:22.815 --> 00:46:27.738]  Anybody who doesn't go along with the government hates America, or they're racists, or the rest of it.
[00:46:28.018 --> 00:46:46.370]  I think I'm safe in saying that every one of us out here in the alternative media, you, me, all these other people who are trying to basically say we need to get back to the Constitution, we love America, or we love America as it's supposed to be, and we recognize that we've got this oligarchical, fascistic, economic
[00:46:47.731 --> 00:46:56.036]  A cancer at the heart of America that is taking us down a path we don't want to go down towards what inevitably is going to be collapse or a new world war.
[00:46:56.076 --> 00:46:58.037]  And I don't think I want to see either one of them in my lifetime.
[00:46:58.057 --> 00:46:59.938]  Well, I read the synopsis of the show.
[00:46:59.958 --> 00:47:00.959]  I didn't have time to watch it.
[00:47:01.099 --> 00:47:02.740]  Jason Bermas did watch it.
[00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:08.803]  And he said they basically frame Homer in it and that Mr. Burns was involved in it.
[00:47:09.243 --> 00:47:10.984]  And so that's why I'm saying it was conditioning.
[00:47:11.004 --> 00:47:14.667]  So they're even throwing it in our face that they're basically framing people.
[00:47:14.707 --> 00:47:16.708]  But if somebody else saw the show, you can correct me on it.
[00:47:17.188 --> 00:47:19.049]  Unfortunately, I don't have time to watch The Simpsons.
[00:47:19.889 --> 00:47:20.949]  Tim, great call.
[00:47:20.969 --> 00:47:22.450]  Appreciate the info.
[00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:28.872]  We'll be back with Julio, Tim, Shannon, George, and others with the third hour.
[00:47:29.212 --> 00:47:32.233]  We've got Oath Keepers coming up in the fourth hour with key breaking news.
[00:47:32.753 --> 00:47:33.793]  Mike Rivera is our guest.
[00:47:33.813 --> 00:47:38.794]  Stay with us.
[00:47:38.834 --> 00:47:40.375]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:47:41.315 --> 00:47:43.656]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:47:46.328 --> 00:47:48.651]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:47:48.671 --> 00:47:50.934]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:47:51.035 --> 00:47:54.219]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:47:54.259 --> 00:47:59.006]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:47:59.366 --> 00:48:03.552]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:48:03.852 --> 00:48:06.193]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:48:06.333 --> 00:48:08.734]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:48:09.094 --> 00:48:11.655]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:48:11.995 --> 00:48:19.598]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:48:19.932 --> 00:48:25.217]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:48:25.337 --> 00:48:27.619]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:48:27.659 --> 00:48:31.622]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:48:31.882 --> 00:48:32.783]  And I got news for you.
[00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:34.244]  You're everyone else.
[00:48:34.284 --> 00:48:35.285]  Invisible Empire.

[00:48:56.973 --> 00:48:57.814]  Big Brother.
[00:48:58.094 --> 00:48:59.835]  Mainstream media.
[00:49:04.196 --> 00:49:05.277]  Government cover-ups.
[00:49:05.957 --> 00:49:06.757]  You want answers?
[00:49:07.538 --> 00:49:08.438]  Well, so does he.
[00:49:09.078 --> 00:49:12.720]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:17.362]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:49:17.822 --> 00:49:21.084]  Well, we've reached the halfway point worldwide transmission.
[00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:24.365]  We're simulcasting the radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:49:24.425 --> 00:49:26.666]  Mike Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com is our guest.
[00:49:26.726 --> 00:49:28.687]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com.
[00:49:28.707 --> 00:49:30.208]  We're going to continue with your phone calls.
[00:49:30.868 --> 00:49:36.911]  Let me get into a bunch of key news and societal information coming up in about 20 minutes.
[00:49:37.391 --> 00:49:39.773]  But Mike is with us another 20 minutes or so.
[00:49:40.213 --> 00:49:53.820]  Coming back, I want to get into this bill because I've had a chance now, it was brought to my attention this morning via email, to scan over and read HB 6123 that the Democrats have now got very close to passing the Senate.
[00:49:54.693 --> 00:49:54.873]  I think?
[00:50:11.044 --> 00:50:16.287]  If someone looks like a gang member but passes the Brady Bill, it's a felony if you sell them a gun.
[00:50:16.627 --> 00:50:18.048]  And it targets blacks and Hispanics.
[00:50:18.068 --> 00:50:19.649]  But notice, that's real profiling.
[00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:21.510]  You don't hear people freaking out about that.
[00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:23.531]  So we'll be talking about that.
[00:50:23.551 --> 00:50:24.871]  This is very serious.
[00:50:25.032 --> 00:50:30.054]  And Illinois is the model, as California is, for national victim disarmament.
[00:50:30.695 --> 00:50:32.456]  Julio, in Illinois, you're on the air.
[00:50:32.476 --> 00:50:33.036]  Thanks for holding.
[00:50:34.402 --> 00:50:35.163]  No problem, Alex.
[00:50:35.183 --> 00:50:43.252]  It's a beautiful day in Illinois and I'm looking forward, as I'm finishing school, to spend my summer with the National Guard in downtown Chicago.
[00:50:43.272 --> 00:50:45.274]  I can't wait to be a part of that police state.
[00:50:46.315 --> 00:50:53.503]  That's right, they've announced, what Blagojevich announced over a year ago, the military and anti-gun operations.
[00:50:53.543 --> 00:50:53.804]  Go ahead.
[00:50:55.188 --> 00:50:59.515]  Yeah, I'm going to ask about this situation in New York City.
[00:50:59.896 --> 00:51:08.591]  I've been glued to the television all weekend watching the propaganda from the Mockingbird Media and I just got done seeing Eric Holder and
[00:51:09.485 --> 00:51:15.393]  Big Sis, Mr. Napolitano on TV talking about how this was a huge terrorist attack.
[00:51:15.413 --> 00:51:16.334]  It was a deadly bomb.
[00:51:16.374 --> 00:51:21.801]  But hearing you the other day and hearing some people on the news, this was like a phony bomb.
[00:51:21.821 --> 00:51:24.804]  It was kind of a pretty bad job.
[00:51:25.285 --> 00:51:30.087]  Calling for registering, buying gasoline and propane, because everybody could be a terrorist.
[00:51:30.107 --> 00:51:32.449]  I mean, you know, if you use a baseball bat, you're a terrorist.
[00:51:32.829 --> 00:51:36.971]  And interviewing people going, I'm so scared, I'm scared to go out.
[00:51:37.311 --> 00:51:46.515]  I mean, we know, whether it's staged, provocateur, or real, the way they're hyping it, that is the psychological terrorism right there to sell the police state.
[00:51:46.575 --> 00:51:47.116]  Mike Rivera.
[00:51:47.864 --> 00:51:48.825]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:51:48.885 --> 00:51:52.667]  It almost doesn't matter if it's a real event or staged, as I pointed out earlier in the show.
[00:51:53.027 --> 00:51:58.511]  Everybody's going to use everything that happens as an opportunity to push whatever their agenda happens to be.
[00:51:58.831 --> 00:52:01.532]  It's like everything that happens, it's a raining day.
[00:52:01.633 --> 00:52:03.554]  How can I use this to sell my agenda?
[00:52:04.314 --> 00:52:05.035]  The bus is late.
[00:52:05.075 --> 00:52:06.696]  How do I use this to sell my agenda?
[00:52:06.956 --> 00:52:08.817]  Nobody's thinking facts and truths anymore.
[00:52:09.057 --> 00:52:11.719]  We're a nation entirely of propagandistic opportunity.
[00:52:13.049 --> 00:52:20.776]  They've divided us seven ways to Sunday, and it's all about group identity, and then all the groups have their little pimp leaders over them.
[00:52:21.337 --> 00:52:24.119]  Republicans, Democrats, whites, Hispanics, blacks.
[00:52:27.342 --> 00:52:28.764]  I mean, where is it headed, Mike Rivera?
[00:52:29.659 --> 00:52:30.660]  Well, you're right.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:47.291]  They're trying to keep the population badly factionalized and keep us quarreling amongst ourselves because the instant we all unite and recognize that government itself is the biggest threat to our lives, they have to keep us fighting amongst ourselves or we're going to start fighting against them.
[00:52:47.571 --> 00:52:57.097]  There was a recent poll that came out, I think it was Pew Research, I may be wrong on that, but it basically said 80% of respondents viewed the federal government as the biggest danger to their lives.
[00:52:59.619 --> 00:53:04.822]  Pew Research and Gallup and other polls have shown 75 to 81 percent.
[00:53:04.862 --> 00:53:07.604]  So it's all in the 75 or low 80 numbers.
[00:53:07.964 --> 00:53:11.046]  And they had other headlines like, now it's cool to hate the government.
[00:53:11.366 --> 00:53:12.787]  Now it's mainstream.
[00:53:13.147 --> 00:53:15.228]  Now Ron Paul's views are mainstream.
[00:53:15.649 --> 00:53:18.550]  It's not that Ron Paul or you or I or Julio hate the government.
[00:53:18.791 --> 00:53:24.194]  We hate this illegitimate unconstitutional government that's violating the law.
[00:53:24.514 --> 00:53:26.695]  Why do we have these laws to restrain government?
[00:53:27.056 --> 00:53:29.277]  Because our founders had gone through a big
[00:53:29.457 --> 00:53:30.698]  Dog chewed your remote control?
[00:53:30.718 --> 00:53:32.059]  Lost your remote?

[00:54:56.772 --> 00:54:59.375]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:54:59.775 --> 00:55:04.740]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.842]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:55:07.162 --> 00:55:11.967]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:55:12.167 --> 00:55:13.128]  How much do you want?
[00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:14.089]  When do you want it?
[00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:16.071]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:55:16.351 --> 00:55:17.172]  When will you need it?
[00:55:17.433 --> 00:55:19.495]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:55:19.635 --> 00:55:20.676]  Will there be any food?
[00:55:20.956 --> 00:55:22.298]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:55:22.478 --> 00:55:27.544]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:55:27.744 --> 00:55:30.927]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:55:31.328 --> 00:55:34.832]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:55:35.172 --> 00:55:35.913]  How much will you need?
[00:55:36.373 --> 00:55:36.973]  We don't know.
[00:55:37.273 --> 00:55:38.174]  How much do you want?
[00:55:38.374 --> 00:55:39.114]  All you can get.
[00:55:39.314 --> 00:55:40.154]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:55:40.394 --> 00:55:43.155]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:55:43.455 --> 00:55:45.196]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:55:45.216 --> 00:55:46.156]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:55:57.096 --> 00:56:05.203]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[00:56:05.584 --> 00:56:16.033]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[00:56:16.474 --> 00:56:21.899]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[00:56:22.459 --> 00:56:26.922]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[00:56:27.342 --> 00:56:36.068]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[00:56:36.408 --> 00:56:46.235]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[00:56:46.515 --> 00:56:49.697]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:56:50.218 --> 00:56:51.198]  Silverlungs.com.
[00:56:57.592 --> 00:56:58.634]  Big Brother
[00:57:03.018 --> 00:57:04.079]  Mainstream media.
[00:57:04.799 --> 00:57:05.900]  Government cover-ups.
[00:57:06.561 --> 00:57:07.361]  You want answers?
[00:57:08.142 --> 00:57:09.023]  Well, so does he.
[00:57:09.403 --> 00:57:13.326]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:13.886 --> 00:57:17.989]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:24.254]  Mike Rivero joins us for one more segment, and he was bringing up the fact that Obama gave his commencement speech.
[00:57:24.294 --> 00:57:25.775]  We played some clips of it yesterday.
[00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:28.818]  And he said, don't criticize the government.
[00:57:28.858 --> 00:57:30.399]  The government is you, the people.
[00:57:31.809 --> 00:57:33.910]  So whatever the government does, that's what you wanted.
[00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:40.014]  But wait a minute, don't criticize because you're the people, and so you can't criticize the government.
[00:57:40.054 --> 00:57:40.915]  That's double-think.
[00:57:40.995 --> 00:57:48.300]  If we're the government, then we have a right to tell the government when it's doing something we don't like or something that's illegal or unconstitutional.
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:55.725]  And he went on to just, for most of this long speech, say, don't be extreme, don't be rude, be passive, sit down and take it.
[00:57:56.245 --> 00:58:00.168]  And then he had that other White House Correspondents Dinner and made jokes about
[00:58:00.968 --> 00:58:03.731]  You know, this whole event is brought to you by Goldman Sachs.
[00:58:03.751 --> 00:58:06.154]  They don't care if you don't like the jokes, because they're getting all the money.
[00:58:06.915 --> 00:58:13.242]  He made jokes about predator drones killing people, just like Bush made jokes about no WMDs here, nope, not under there.
[00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:17.187]  So, this incredible arrogance.
[00:58:17.367 --> 00:58:19.950]  Meanwhile, government is running
[00:58:20.922 --> 00:58:22.783]  TV ads all over the country.
[00:58:22.803 --> 00:58:24.704]  I mean, they have announcements here in Austin every year.
[00:58:25.264 --> 00:58:29.946]  And over 10% of Texas has warrants out for their arrest saying, it's roundup time, roundup.
[00:58:29.966 --> 00:58:31.347]  You better pay your fines and fees.
[00:58:31.367 --> 00:58:32.227]  We're coming to your door.
[00:58:32.287 --> 00:58:33.048]  We know where you live.
[00:58:33.088 --> 00:58:33.808]  It's roundup.
[00:58:34.148 --> 00:58:37.410]  So when they have a real political roundup, people will just say, oh, it's another roundup.
[00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:42.612]  But they have these ads, they also have similar ones in England, where the government's watching you from satellite.
[00:58:42.692 --> 00:58:43.672]  They're God.
[00:58:43.692 --> 00:58:52.016]  You know, I covered the Fox News story where all these police chiefs are saying, we wear black masks to intimidate you, to instill a sense of fear.
[00:58:52.576 --> 00:58:56.197]  So the state is trying to intimidate us so they can rob us.
[00:58:56.718 --> 00:58:58.098]  I mean, it's very elementary.
[00:58:58.118 --> 00:58:59.799]  This is what happens every other time in history.
[00:59:00.459 --> 00:59:02.380]  Liberty and freedom is incredibly rare.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:05.683]  It's a jewel that must be protected, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[00:59:05.703 --> 00:59:11.246]  And he said, if you let private central banks come in, you will wake up homeless on the continent your forefathers conquered.
[00:59:11.667 --> 00:59:22.134]  So I wanted to play this clip of Pennsylvania fear-mongering, where the government is like, we're God, we're omnipresent, we know where you live.
[00:59:22.214 --> 00:59:24.195]  Nice car, nice house, Tom.
[00:59:24.415 --> 00:59:26.256]  What's not nice is you, Tom.
[00:59:27.137 --> 00:59:29.038]  So again, we're government, we're God.
[00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:34.545]  We're the big Skynet above you, controlling everything.
[00:59:34.665 --> 00:59:36.327]  This is government terrorism.
[00:59:36.628 --> 00:59:37.890]  This is Big Brother.
[00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:39.392]  This is authoritarian tyranny.
[00:59:39.592 --> 00:59:40.133]  Here's the clip.
[00:59:40.689 --> 00:59:41.770]  Your name is Tom.
[00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:43.811]  You live just off of 5th Street.
[00:59:43.992 --> 00:59:44.952]  Nice car, Tom.
[00:59:44.972 --> 00:59:45.953]  Nice house.
[00:59:46.153 --> 00:59:52.198]  What's not so nice is you owe Pennsylvania $4,212 in back taxes.
[00:59:52.838 --> 00:59:53.579]  Listen, Tom.
[00:59:53.999 --> 00:59:55.100]  We can make this easy.
[00:59:55.620 --> 01:00:01.124]  Pay online by June 18th, and we'll skip your penalty and take half off your interest.
[01:00:02.045 --> 01:00:05.388]  Because, Tom, we do know who you are.
[01:00:06.715 --> 01:00:07.916]  Find us before we find you.
[01:00:07.936 --> 01:00:07.976]  P.A.
[01:00:09.657 --> 01:00:10.478]  Tax Pay Up.
[01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:17.783]  Now imagine the mafia coming to your door and saying, nice car, nice house, we're going to make this easy on you.
[01:00:18.583 --> 01:00:23.387]  The condescending voice, the Borg voice, you will be assimilated.
[01:00:25.268 --> 01:00:29.591]  Dave, I had to kill the other astronaut and now I'm going to kill you.
[01:00:30.192 --> 01:00:31.232]  That's the message here.
[01:00:31.292 --> 01:00:31.853]  Mike Rivera.
[01:00:32.659 --> 01:00:33.520]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:38.943]  I mean, this is a direct contradiction to Obama's claim that the people are the government, which is complete nonsense.
[01:00:39.223 --> 01:00:46.068]  The people have been screaming for years, lower taxes, stop spending money on war, stop giving our money to Israel.
[01:00:46.528 --> 01:00:48.189]  The government isn't listening to the people.
[01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:51.391]  The Congress that passed TARP proved that.
[01:00:51.791 --> 01:00:57.155]  And the bottom line is, you're absolutely right, the biggest terrorist in our lives right now is the federal government.
[01:00:57.615 --> 01:01:01.978]  I'm not worried about Osama Bin Laden, who's actually dead despite this latest documentary.
[01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:05.360]  We're all worried about the federal government.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:15.286]  Even the people who've still got the money to pay their taxes, they're worried the government is going to totally destroy the economy and wreck our lives a year from now.
[01:01:16.527 --> 01:01:20.949]  It's really reached a point where everybody is very, very concerned about what the federal government is doing.
[01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:22.831]  The government does not represent us.
[01:01:23.191 --> 01:01:26.153]  And now you've got the president up there saying, please don't criticize us.
[01:01:26.393 --> 01:01:27.554]  You're not supposed to do that.
[01:01:27.954 --> 01:01:41.383]  I find it hard to believe that Obama was a constitutional scholar or professor because he seems to have forgotten that the original intent of the First Amendment gives every American citizen the right to stand up and tell the government they're full of it.
[01:01:41.903 --> 01:01:43.324]  Without fear of reprisals.
[01:01:43.404 --> 01:01:47.205]  No, now they're saying you're the government, so sit down and shut up.
[01:01:47.546 --> 01:01:49.687]  Well, if we're the government, then we have a right to speak.
[01:01:50.147 --> 01:01:51.127]  This is so elementary.
[01:01:51.167 --> 01:01:59.591]  He's expanding secret arrests, torture, wars, and now, like Bush, making jokes about dead people with the drones.
[01:02:00.171 --> 01:02:05.114]  This is done on purpose to enrage foreign enemies so that people do actually strike us.
[01:02:06.178 --> 01:02:14.080]  Well yeah, our government needs to have real acts of terror to keep us under control, and when they don't get the real acts of terror, they're going to fake them.
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:20.981]  And again, Adolf Hitler did exactly the same thing to his people, and the end result was World War II.
[01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:28.383]  And the end result of our government doing it to the American people is going to be World War III, and folks, we will lose this one.
[01:02:28.903 --> 01:02:31.506]  And by the way, that's what many government heads are saying.
[01:02:31.526 --> 01:02:33.349]  We're really going into World War III.
[01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:35.151]  They are planning to hit Iran.
[01:02:35.872 --> 01:02:38.415]  They've got a martial law scenario here domestically.
[01:02:38.435 --> 01:02:41.399]  And it won't be announced as martial law.
[01:02:41.439 --> 01:02:43.501]  It'll be civil emergency, just like Mexico.
[01:02:44.122 --> 01:02:45.464]  And it's so elementary.
[01:02:45.504 --> 01:03:04.085]  They bring in 30 million plus illegal aliens who would be hard-working good parts of society if they weren't given all this welfare and told to hate America because they know the American people are waking up so they're trying to get as many foreigners here to fill up the military and everything else to be used as a weapon because they can have a
[01:03:05.066 --> 01:03:06.947]  Willing group that they pay off to do it.
[01:03:07.288 --> 01:03:24.399]  I mean this is high treason This is a completely bankrupt out of control group of criminals I mean the mere fact that they're slapping Goldman Sachs on the wrist and focusing on a few low-level traders when they ran the whole Financial implosion not just here, but worldwide by design and we have the documents.
[01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:27.301]  I mean Where does it end though?
[01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:34.646]  I mean, I don't I think the average Americans waking up Mike I don't think the average American knows just how bad it really is
[01:03:35.266 --> 01:03:36.968]  No, the average American does not.
[01:03:37.028 --> 01:03:46.134]  We had a friend over here the other day who's involved in the local Democratic Party and is still basically drinking the Kool-Aid for 90% of what they see on the corporate TV networks.
[01:03:46.475 --> 01:03:50.037]  The bottom line is what, you know, they're pushing for this global government.
[01:03:50.097 --> 01:03:51.158]  I don't think they're going to get it.
[01:03:51.539 --> 01:04:02.767]  The end result is these bozos could bring about a whole new dark ages by collapsing the world government and not having, or collapsing all the governments of the world and not having anything credible to take its place in.
[01:04:02.807 --> 01:04:04.549]  Look what corrupt government's done in Mexico.
[01:04:04.669 --> 01:04:05.790]  It is collapsed.
[01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:07.812]  Mexico is collapsed right now.
[01:04:08.153 --> 01:04:11.837]  Even the small areas they kept safe for tourists have now collapsed.
[01:04:11.897 --> 01:04:14.179]  I mean, this is what corrupt government does.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.581]  Look at North Korea.
[01:04:15.601 --> 01:04:19.145]  I mean, this is what we're going to turn into.
[01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:31.815]  And it's absolutely horrible and it's painful to watch for those of us who grew up in this country with this very wonderful idea of what America was supposed to be, to see America being murdered by the government itself.
[01:04:32.115 --> 01:04:39.919]  Not foreign terrorists, not foreign invasion, but destroyed from within by a government that has sold us out to private interests and foreign interests.
[01:04:40.459 --> 01:04:42.020]  It's painful to watch, it really is.
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:42.600]  It is.
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:44.441]  Tim in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:04:46.213 --> 01:04:48.054]  It's a pleasure to speak with you.
[01:04:48.074 --> 01:04:49.614]  Turn your radio off.
[01:04:49.694 --> 01:04:50.555]  It's good to talk to you.
[01:04:50.895 --> 01:04:51.655]  Turn your radio off.
[01:04:53.276 --> 01:04:54.736]  Okay, I'm in a warehouse.
[01:04:54.816 --> 01:04:55.336]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:04:55.356 --> 01:04:56.157]  It was just real noisy.
[01:04:56.177 --> 01:04:56.517]  Go ahead.
[01:04:57.237 --> 01:04:57.517]  Okay.
[01:04:57.897 --> 01:05:04.240]  First of all, I'm in New York, and I want to say, since you played that clip, the false flags are at half-mast in Times Square.
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.681]  I just want to go over with you the propaganda.
[01:05:08.181 --> 01:05:08.601]  Wait a minute.
[01:05:08.641 --> 01:05:09.062]  Wait a minute.
[01:05:09.122 --> 01:05:12.683]  They put the flags at half-mast when no one died?
[01:05:13.669 --> 01:05:15.432]  No, no, I was just making an analogy.
[01:05:15.612 --> 01:05:18.916]  The tall flags are at half mass in Times Square.
[01:05:20.258 --> 01:05:30.873]  The propaganda that I've seen on the local news here last night, Fox News, since they didn't have a suspect yet, we're talking about how great it was to have video surveillance.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:42.463]  And it's a lot like the show 24, and they kept using the word sexy to describe watching video after video trying to find a terrorist.
[01:05:42.543 --> 01:05:44.464]  How sexy it is.
[01:05:44.844 --> 01:05:52.246]  And another term that the reporter used last night was that we need a world-class surveillance
[01:05:53.612 --> 01:05:55.114]  I've been hearing that.
[01:05:55.374 --> 01:05:56.595]  I've been hearing that everywhere.
[01:05:56.955 --> 01:05:58.236]  We need cameras everywhere.
[01:05:58.376 --> 01:06:01.759]  Or my gosh, we might have a person or two die a year.
[01:06:01.799 --> 01:06:06.403]  We better give up our whole way of life and give trillions of dollars to the Chertoff Group.
[01:06:06.443 --> 01:06:12.208]  And I had some CIA veteran, part of the Chertoff Group, on Fox saying, our way of life has ended.
[01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:18.012]  Yeah, and then they had Congressman Israel on saying, our way of life has ended, this is a new way.
[01:06:18.032 --> 01:06:20.814]  You know, oh my gosh, a truck full of gasoline!
[01:06:21.214 --> 01:06:21.814]  It's over!
[01:06:21.874 --> 01:06:26.618]  But every couple days, some house blows up from a gas main and kills a bunch of people.
[01:06:26.918 --> 01:06:28.559]  You know, it's the end of the world!
[01:06:28.659 --> 01:06:29.600]  Somebody died!
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:30.200]  Mike Rivera.
[01:06:32.179 --> 01:06:32.779]  Yeah, it is.
[01:06:32.859 --> 01:06:36.803]  It's fear-mongering and it's panic.
[01:06:37.423 --> 01:06:39.425]  Basically, the government is trying to keep us afraid.
[01:06:39.826 --> 01:06:47.613]  And the problem with that is, once a government starts using fear to control their people, they're going to have to keep using fear to keep them under control.
[01:06:47.933 --> 01:06:53.399]  If the government ever lets the fear subside, if they ever let the people calm down to where they can start thinking,
[01:06:54.099 --> 01:06:54.599]  Uh, again.
[01:06:54.619 --> 01:06:57.521]  Uh, then it's really going to start falling apart on them.
[01:06:57.561 --> 01:07:00.243]  And I think that's what's happening now because fear is very tiring.
[01:07:00.543 --> 01:07:02.104]  Fear burns itself out.
[01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:05.167]  And I think people are too tired to be afraid anymore.
[01:07:05.227 --> 01:07:07.448]  And let me add, let me add, exactly.
[01:07:07.468 --> 01:07:08.369]  Let me add the caveat.
[01:07:08.389 --> 01:07:09.089]  Let's not forget.
[01:07:09.149 --> 01:07:13.552]  Governor Ridge came out and wrote a book last year admitting that they were issuing the terror alerts and that they were fake.
[01:07:13.592 --> 01:07:20.036]  As we said, five, six years ago, yourself and myself and many others admitted that the terror alerts were fake for political gain.
[01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:23.659]  And they've been caught over and over and over and over and over again doing this.
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:25.561]  Yeah, it is.
[01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:27.102]  It's all about the manipulation.
[01:07:27.122 --> 01:07:32.307]  I mean, they used to be able to wave communists at us and we'd just pay taxes and send our kids off to die in wars.
[01:07:32.667 --> 01:07:42.236]  Then the Cold War was over and ever since then, there's always going to be a new monster, a war on drugs, a war on terror, a war on carbon dioxide, a war on whatever.
[01:07:42.256 --> 01:07:47.721]  They're always going to come up with something new that we're supposed to be afraid of and give them money to protect us from.
[01:07:49.326 --> 01:08:02.552]  The New York Times also has an opinion article on their website today, Finding the Terrorist Next Door, in which they support a police state and a term that is used throughout the article as well.
[01:08:03.393 --> 01:08:04.334]  Yeah, no, I've been hearing it.
[01:08:04.354 --> 01:08:06.375]  It's just, our way of life is over.
[01:08:07.056 --> 01:08:10.378]  America had to, we've got to give all the money to the banks and the military.
[01:08:10.918 --> 01:08:11.979]  Sorry!
[01:08:12.619 --> 01:08:17.042]  But again, we have an elite that's used our government and our military and our tax money to dominate the globe.
[01:08:17.362 --> 01:08:19.024]  Of course they're going to rob us too!
[01:08:19.464 --> 01:08:27.709]  If they'll kill a million plus Iraqis for some weapon sales and oil and for strategic interest of Israel, of course they'll do anything to us!
[01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:29.911]  I mean, they see us as just as worthless
[01:08:30.271 --> 01:08:31.312]  As they see other people.
[01:08:31.352 --> 01:08:32.313]  I appreciate your call, Tim.
[01:08:32.613 --> 01:08:35.036]  Mike Rivera, always enjoy our once a month visit.
[01:08:35.116 --> 01:08:37.037]  Always great going back and forth with you.
[01:08:37.057 --> 01:08:38.739]  Very thought-provoking.
[01:08:38.999 --> 01:08:41.041]  And we'll talk to you again coming up in a month, God willing.
[01:08:41.702 --> 01:08:42.943]  Thank you very much for having me.
[01:08:43.123 --> 01:08:43.363]  You bet.
[01:08:43.383 --> 01:08:45.185]  There goes Mike Rivera, WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:08:45.505 --> 01:08:50.189]  I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:50.489 --> 01:08:56.355]  Don't forget our auxiliary websites, Infowars.net, JonesReport.com and WhatIsTheEndgame.com.
[01:08:57.503 --> 01:08:58.403]  Global meltdowns.
[01:08:58.744 --> 01:08:59.784]  Massive unemployment.
[01:09:00.164 --> 01:09:00.945]  Endless wars.
[01:09:01.365 --> 01:09:02.606]  A new currency crisis.
[01:09:03.026 --> 01:09:04.747]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:06.948]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[01:09:07.248 --> 01:09:08.869]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:10.850]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[01:09:11.230 --> 01:09:12.811]  Introducing Off The Grid News.
[01:09:13.211 --> 01:09:19.374]  A weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[01:09:19.694 --> 01:09:24.638]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.

[01:09:56.607 --> 01:09:59.329]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:09:59.569 --> 01:10:03.511]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:10:03.711 --> 01:10:05.792]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:10:05.992 --> 01:10:11.015]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:10:11.155 --> 01:10:12.896]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:10:12.976 --> 01:10:14.277]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:10:14.497 --> 01:10:15.957]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:10:15.977 --> 01:10:19.078]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:10:19.358 --> 01:10:24.400]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:33.822]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[01:10:34.062 --> 01:10:38.665]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:10:39.246 --> 01:10:42.568]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000 year history.
[01:10:42.728 --> 01:10:46.431]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:10:46.531 --> 01:10:48.632]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[01:10:48.652 --> 01:10:48.812]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:10:58.106 --> 01:10:59.808]  And you're subject to other police action.
[01:11:00.569 --> 01:11:01.490]  Tyranny is here.
[01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:05.534]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:11:05.635 --> 01:11:07.997]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:11:08.017 --> 01:11:13.404]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:11:13.874 --> 01:11:20.122]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:11:20.543 --> 01:11:26.090]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:11:26.530 --> 01:11:30.195]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:11:30.675 --> 01:11:34.676]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:11:34.976 --> 01:11:40.497]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:11:40.918 --> 01:11:43.918]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:11:44.478 --> 01:11:45.899]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:11:46.439 --> 01:11:46.939]  It's here.

[01:11:56.033 --> 01:11:56.553]  You worry.
[01:11:56.953 --> 01:11:58.674]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[01:11:58.974 --> 01:12:01.195]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[01:12:01.516 --> 01:12:03.336]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[01:12:03.597 --> 01:12:04.817]  Your answer may be at hand.
[01:12:05.217 --> 01:12:08.419]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[01:12:08.799 --> 01:12:13.661]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[01:12:14.041 --> 01:12:17.343]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[01:12:17.847 --> 01:12:19.187]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[01:12:19.528 --> 01:12:22.128]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[01:12:22.388 --> 01:12:25.349]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[01:12:25.689 --> 01:12:33.852]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[01:12:34.132 --> 01:12:38.533]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[01:12:38.813 --> 01:12:42.515]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.

[01:13:00.686 --> 01:13:13.350]  I want to get into how race is truly tribalism and how the globalists use it to control us coming up in the next several segments, but I want to go back to your phone calls here.
[01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:15.531]  Dealing with race
[01:13:17.904 --> 01:13:31.464]  All the Arizona law, and I've now had a chance to read it several times, says that the feds won't enforce this law if we pull somebody over for drunk driving or whatever, or we have probable cause that they're illegal aliens.
[01:13:32.585 --> 01:13:35.886]  We're going to ask them for their ID, and if they're illegal aliens, we're going to take them into jail.
[01:13:36.166 --> 01:13:44.948]  Now that's what every other country on earth does, except for Western Europe and the United States and Canada and Australia, because they want to break down our sovereignty because we're the wealthy countries.
[01:13:45.508 --> 01:13:47.449]  We're being robbed by the banking class.
[01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:57.991]  But this story out of Chicago and out of Illinois, a bill that would effectively prohibit African-Americans and Hispanics from buying guns advances in Illinois General Assembly.
[01:13:58.031 --> 01:14:00.272]  See, I don't
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:10.803]  want to be overrun by foreigners at the globalist control because almost to a man they're voting to take our liberties as a client group of the government.
[01:14:12.583 --> 01:14:16.705]  I don't at the same time want to see blacks and hispanics aborting most their kids.
[01:14:17.945 --> 01:14:18.646]  They're human beings.
[01:14:18.786 --> 01:14:19.326]  I care about them.
[01:14:19.967 --> 01:14:21.267]  I want them to be patriots.
[01:14:21.448 --> 01:14:22.688]  I want to wake them up.
[01:14:23.109 --> 01:14:24.329]  I want to be able to reach out to them.
[01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:33.336]  But with the Latin Americans, because they don't speak English, and because Mexico lost two wars with the US, they are particularly angry and have been taught to hate this country.
[01:14:33.596 --> 01:14:35.077]  That's why it's such a problem.
[01:14:35.377 --> 01:14:37.258]  Is that saying all of these people have that view?
[01:14:37.538 --> 01:14:37.699]  No.
[01:14:38.439 --> 01:14:47.342]  But a large portion do, and you can just go Google Auslan, or go to YouTube, and you'll see hundreds of videos of mayors, and congressmen, and the mayor of L.A.
[01:14:50.163 --> 01:14:52.544]  Just the most racist stuff you can imagine.
[01:14:53.564 --> 01:14:59.466]  Go home pilgrim, die white race, you're scum, you're evil, you need to die, we need to plant a San Diego.
[01:15:00.586 --> 01:15:01.287]  It's disgusting.
[01:15:01.347 --> 01:15:05.448]  Meanwhile, you don't hear the Hispanic and black leaders criticizing this, no, they're authoring it.
[01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:19.236]  Law-abiding African-Americans and Hispanics would take it on the chin under a bill now moving through the Illinois General Assembly, sponsored by Representative Harry Osterman, Democrat District 14.
[01:15:19.336 --> 01:15:19.936]  It's HB 6123.
[01:15:20.176 --> 01:15:20.456]  HB 6123.
[01:15:26.735 --> 01:15:27.435]  We're good to go.
[01:15:57.976 --> 01:16:04.881]  But the Feds are coming in and it's threatening ATF arrest of gun shops all over the country if they sell to someone missing a finger.
[01:16:04.901 --> 01:16:06.122]  Because that means they're a bomb maker.
[01:16:06.783 --> 01:16:09.545]  No, they got their finger chopped off in a factory or running a combine.
[01:16:10.586 --> 01:16:13.548]  Or an engine block fell on their hand working at a shop.
[01:16:13.608 --> 01:16:21.995]  I mean, how many craftsmen, how many farmers, ranchers, woodworkers, steelworkers, factory workers,
[01:16:25.615 --> 01:16:27.896]  Carpenters do you know that are missing a finger or two?
[01:16:29.536 --> 01:16:31.116]  We've shown you those training manuals.
[01:16:31.977 --> 01:16:36.758]  Where it's your responsibility not to sell to them and to call us.
[01:16:37.218 --> 01:16:40.339]  Under this bill, it provides racial profiling.
[01:16:41.099 --> 01:16:44.500]  And it says if you're wearing baggy pants or have tattoos,
[01:16:49.141 --> 01:17:04.866]  Given the provisions it says it established, no test for determining street gang membership, given the harsh penalties for violating the proposed law, it is understandable that retailers would shy away from selling firearms to a person whose speech, dress, mannerisms, or taste in music reflect an urban lifestyle.
[01:17:05.587 --> 01:17:08.427]  So, I mean, this is targeting black people mainly.
[01:17:09.408 --> 01:17:11.008]  Don't sell guns to black people!
[01:17:11.589 --> 01:17:18.611]  And that's the Democratic Party, the same one in the 1870s who passed laws in the South to not sell guns to black people.
[01:17:20.982 --> 01:17:21.963]  Oh, it makes me sick.
[01:17:22.744 --> 01:17:25.366]  It just absolutely makes me want to throw up.
[01:17:26.447 --> 01:17:29.489]  And just the arrogance, the over-the-topness of this.
[01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:32.011]  Shannon in Mississippi, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:17:33.272 --> 01:17:34.273]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:17:34.473 --> 01:17:34.874]  Pretty good.
[01:17:34.914 --> 01:17:35.494]  What's on your mind?
[01:17:36.595 --> 01:17:42.160]  I just wanted to talk to you and comment a couple things about immigration, and I have a couple questions for you.
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:45.883]  I'm from a small town in Mississippi, and I work construction.
[01:17:47.156 --> 01:17:51.777]  About every job that I get to go work on, 95% of the people there are Mexicans.
[01:17:52.057 --> 01:17:52.957]  And I wear a U.S.
[01:17:52.997 --> 01:17:54.298]  Border Patrol hat every day.
[01:17:54.358 --> 01:17:56.338]  I love my country, but I fear my government.
[01:17:56.958 --> 01:18:03.159]  And I go up and I ask them, I'll make it the point to go up and ask some of these, you know, are you legal or illegal?
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:08.501]  And 95% of them will just look at me and smile and say I'm illegal.
[01:18:09.181 --> 01:18:11.981]  And then a week down the road, I'm getting laid off of my job.
[01:18:12.201 --> 01:18:14.982]  They're squeezing me to death with all these new taxes.
[01:18:15.481 --> 01:18:23.963]  And a question I wanted to ask you, Alex, today is, this national ID that's coming out, when do you think this will hit?
[01:18:24.763 --> 01:18:29.024]  And I'm refusing to get this national ID card, so what does that mean for me?
[01:18:29.444 --> 01:18:40.086]  Okay, the way it's written, and this is in the AP, it's in the Hill newspaper, in fact, here's the article right here, you won't be able to have a job and the illegals don't have to have it.
[01:18:40.906 --> 01:18:43.247]  So, stay there, I'll explain this when we get back.
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.021]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:18:50.962 --> 01:18:53.703]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:18:56.324 --> 01:18:57.605]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:57.645 --> 01:19:02.987]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:19:03.207 --> 01:19:07.849]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:19:08.230 --> 01:19:13.272]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:19:13.812 --> 01:19:18.495]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:19:19.036 --> 01:19:20.957]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:19:21.337 --> 01:19:25.960]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:27.041]  And here's the best part.
[01:19:27.261 --> 01:19:30.043]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:19:30.323 --> 01:19:33.645]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:19:33.966 --> 01:19:36.807]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:19:37.148 --> 01:19:39.029]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:19:39.369 --> 01:19:40.290]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:19:43.932 --> 01:19:45.713]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:19:46.894 --> 01:19:52.676]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:19:52.996 --> 01:19:55.438]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:19:56.398 --> 01:20:01.841]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:20:03.061 --> 01:20:07.884]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:20:08.204 --> 01:20:09.664]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:32.852]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most Blue diamond gussets got it

[01:20:53.588 --> 01:20:54.088]  Others don't.
[01:21:00.094 --> 01:21:00.995]  Tyranny is here.
[01:21:01.335 --> 01:21:04.916]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:21:04.977 --> 01:21:07.498]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:21:07.518 --> 01:21:12.941]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[01:21:13.381 --> 01:21:19.624]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:21:20.044 --> 01:21:25.587]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:21:25.987 --> 01:21:29.689]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:21:30.189 --> 01:21:34.211]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:21:34.491 --> 01:21:40.034]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:21:40.434 --> 01:21:43.415]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:21:43.976 --> 01:21:45.396]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:21:45.957 --> 01:21:46.397]  It's here.

[01:22:02.764 --> 01:22:05.246]  Let me answer Shannon's question as best I can.
[01:22:06.966 --> 01:22:08.187]  Take the carbon taxes.
[01:22:08.207 --> 01:22:09.828]  You're saying, what does this have to do with illegal aliens?
[01:22:09.848 --> 01:22:10.348]  I'll explain.
[01:22:10.368 --> 01:22:12.189]  Before we go back to him.
[01:22:14.457 --> 01:22:26.524]  Mexico, China, India, Malaysia, Taiwan, over 160 nations under the agreement have to make no carbon dioxide cuts.
[01:22:27.944 --> 01:22:29.826]  The West has to make cuts of at least 20%.
[01:22:33.227 --> 01:22:36.829]  So what's going to happen to the few factories and jobs and businesses we have?
[01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:37.590]  They're going to leave.
[01:22:39.076 --> 01:22:46.461]  China has no environmental standards, no insurance, no workers' compensation, no environmental cleanup bills.
[01:22:46.641 --> 01:22:47.482]  They just do whatever they want.
[01:22:49.243 --> 01:22:50.043]  Same thing with India.
[01:22:51.244 --> 01:22:56.628]  And it's not that we're against the people of India or Mexico or China or Eastern Europe.
[01:22:57.368 --> 01:22:58.769]  They're being exploited as well.
[01:23:00.170 --> 01:23:03.612]  And the globalists have stated they want to drive down wages.
[01:23:03.632 --> 01:23:07.615]  And they lied to the public and said NAFTA and GATT and the WTO are going to be great for you.
[01:23:08.595 --> 01:23:09.819]  They've known exactly what would happen.
[01:23:12.205 --> 01:23:17.826]  And Mexico, in the last 17, 18 years since NAFTA, for the first decade, they did well.
[01:23:18.166 --> 01:23:24.747]  They got to move up to the maquiladoras, they got paid low wages, but it was still better than some of the things they had in Mexico City.
[01:23:25.407 --> 01:23:31.508]  The government used environmental laws to drive most of the indigenous people off their land, on record, up to those factories.
[01:23:31.788 --> 01:23:41.210]  Now almost all those factories are shut down, because it can't compete with China, where the average salary is about 55 cents an hour.
[01:23:42.349 --> 01:23:45.310]  We're talking about people maybe making a couple thousand dollars a year.
[01:23:46.290 --> 01:23:48.971]  Now, you can never compete with that.
[01:23:49.551 --> 01:24:03.835]  Now, what you're dealing with in construction, and I've talked to chefs in Dallas, chefs in Houston, chefs in Los Angeles, where now if you can't speak Spanish, you're just basically kicked off.
[01:24:03.875 --> 01:24:04.695]  They won't work with you.
[01:24:05.416 --> 01:24:09.177]  So there's also a view of whether you're Hispanic American,
[01:24:11.055 --> 01:24:12.175]  Black, white, it doesn't matter.
[01:24:12.275 --> 01:24:13.436]  You're not wanted.
[01:24:13.836 --> 01:24:15.196]  So it's also very, very tribal.
[01:24:15.356 --> 01:24:16.237]  Perfect for the government.
[01:24:16.597 --> 01:24:21.958]  Because the average people can't hear the language, don't understand it, don't know what's going on under the surface.
[01:24:22.599 --> 01:24:25.780]  So the government also gives massive welfare to these groups.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:35.803]  I've seen reports of the average illegal being on three forms of welfare under three fake consulate matricula IDs that the government just issues to their people because that money gets sent back home.
[01:24:37.210 --> 01:24:42.695]  But on the issue of construction and other jobs, including cities, counties, and states, and the feds, remember the border fence?
[01:24:42.775 --> 01:24:44.016]  Part of it was being built by illegals.
[01:24:45.177 --> 01:24:48.960]  Just the 50-something miles of show fence they built, and they never finished it, of course.
[01:24:52.063 --> 01:24:52.944]  The illegal aliens
[01:24:54.679 --> 01:24:59.162]  Are there to undermine jobs, there to bankrupt people, there to drive wages down.
[01:24:59.202 --> 01:25:00.423]  That's what globalization is.
[01:25:01.124 --> 01:25:04.546]  And so the illegals can live 5, 10, 15 to an apartment or a house.
[01:25:05.427 --> 01:25:06.988]  They avoid most the taxes.
[01:25:07.008 --> 01:25:08.989]  They're supplemented with welfare.
[01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:11.811]  They don't have to show all the forms of ID that citizens do.
[01:25:12.112 --> 01:25:13.673]  They get let go when they're drunk driving.
[01:25:13.713 --> 01:25:19.477]  They get let go when they're caught with $105,000 of drug money in Knoxville, Tennessee that we covered yesterday.
[01:25:20.418 --> 01:25:23.020]  Because they are on the government team.
[01:25:24.246 --> 01:25:34.109]  They are needed to de-industrialize and break the United States to get rid of the middle class, which is what global elites always, in modern history, push to do.
[01:25:34.409 --> 01:25:35.650]  They don't want you independent.
[01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:37.030]  They don't want you doing well.
[01:25:37.050 --> 01:25:39.131]  They don't want the next generation doing better.
[01:25:39.171 --> 01:25:40.751]  What does the head of the IMF say last week?
[01:25:41.011 --> 01:25:41.872]  The good times are over.
[01:25:41.892 --> 01:25:42.632]  You're gonna be poor.
[01:25:43.352 --> 01:25:43.972]  Get used to it.
[01:25:44.292 --> 01:25:45.453]  We've broken up your families.
[01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:46.413]  You're all working now.
[01:25:46.473 --> 01:25:47.533]  The state's got your kids.
[01:25:47.933 --> 01:25:50.674]  This is just the further process of domestication.
[01:25:51.214 --> 01:25:52.475]  So it's the same thing with the illegals.
[01:25:53.479 --> 01:26:04.607]  They're brought in to undermine jobs and to drive down the standard of living and to bankrupt the states so the federal government, which is itself controlled by the offshore banks, can come in and take over.
[01:26:05.167 --> 01:26:09.330]  And so that's why there'll be no enforcement on the illegal aliens.
[01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:21.519]  They're not going to have to get IDs, but it's going to be felonies for citizens, and that's in the immigration bill, if you don't have this federalized worker ID card that tracks everything you do and ties into the IRS and the health care bill.
[01:26:22.455 --> 01:26:28.278]  And even before the health care bill passed, three months before it passed, Illinois was already implementing the provisions of it.
[01:26:28.758 --> 01:26:32.620]  So, they just do whatever they want.
[01:26:34.021 --> 01:26:37.463]  And that's only one dimension of it.
[01:26:38.043 --> 01:26:44.947]  Then the illegals again will vote for bigger government, more handouts, gun control, as long as the party in power gives them some goodies.
[01:26:46.872 --> 01:26:51.099]  And the system's always been worried about immigrant populations waking up.
[01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:54.685]  They've been really worried about keeping blacks on the Democratic Party reservation.
[01:26:54.725 --> 01:26:55.887]  Not that the Republicans would save them.
[01:26:57.630 --> 01:27:00.394]  They took, what, you had almost 90%
[01:27:02.745 --> 01:27:30.633]  in the nineteen forties and fifties of blacks uh... in america were quote legitimate meaning it was a mother and a father and blacks owned their own businesses and uh... were very very wealthy there were just a lot of uh... a very large black middle class okay and and uh... it's on record the cia began shipping and cocaine heroin they would only allow the hooker operations to be in the black neighborhood as a way to degradate the society
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:35.942]  I mean, this is a weaponized system, a war going on.
[01:27:37.663 --> 01:27:40.005]  But it isn't even so much that the globalists hate blacks.
[01:27:40.365 --> 01:27:40.805]  They do.
[01:27:41.486 --> 01:27:48.830]  But it's mainly they always pick a minority to beta test it, like they told you the police state was for Arabs and Muslims and foreigners.
[01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:53.813]  But now we get the internal documents and now they openly announce it's for the American people, period.
[01:27:56.013 --> 01:27:59.235]  And so they've got the average black person loving the Democratic Party.
[01:27:59.255 --> 01:28:05.479]  Well, the Democratic Party, under the Rockefellers and others, is there to abort their babies, more than half of them.
[01:28:05.499 --> 01:28:06.900]  They're to poison their food and water.
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:08.381]  They're to shoot them up with deadly shots.
[01:28:08.762 --> 01:28:11.263]  They're to ship drugs in and then put their kids in prison.
[01:28:11.944 --> 01:28:15.726]  The media is there to sell the gangster, you know, gangster rap culture.
[01:28:16.146 --> 01:28:19.269]  It's all crafted, but they sell the same culture to everybody else.
[01:28:19.689 --> 01:28:25.833]  They've just had the blacks where they want them longer because they came out of slavery and never had a middle class.
[01:28:26.533 --> 01:28:29.935]  Well, they developed one by the 30s, 40s, and 50s, and that's gone now.
[01:28:30.236 --> 01:28:32.637]  You have 90 plus percent illegitimacy.
[01:28:34.218 --> 01:28:35.919]  People say, oh, well, you're attacking single parents.
[01:28:36.019 --> 01:28:36.440]  No, I'm not.
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:42.403]  I'm stating the fact that you're four times more likely to end up in prison or on drugs if you come from a single home.
[01:28:43.784 --> 01:28:44.985]  You need two parents there.
[01:28:47.228 --> 01:28:49.250]  I mean, you know, my kids don't behave that good for my wife.
[01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:50.431]  They behave better for me.
[01:28:50.451 --> 01:28:52.732]  I mean, everybody knows that's just the natural order of things.
[01:28:53.493 --> 01:28:58.677]  And if I wasn't there, I mean, it's not that my wife, my wife's a wonderful person, harder working than I am in many respects.
[01:28:58.977 --> 01:29:00.278]  It's just, it's a lot to take care of.
[01:29:00.578 --> 01:29:04.662]  And imagine if my wife had to work, then the state gets my kids.
[01:29:05.322 --> 01:29:06.383]  So that's the goal.
[01:29:10.094 --> 01:29:16.239]  That's a long answer, Shannon, to your question, but they have, and it's also multi-pronged.
[01:29:16.259 --> 01:29:24.786]  The globalists always run the same operation four or five or six or seven different ways, knowing that, it's like firing ten torpedoes at a ship.
[01:29:25.406 --> 01:29:28.729]  You know, the submarine pops up, floods the tubes, fires.
[01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:35.655]  It's a big capital ship, they want to fire every torpedo they've got so that they are sure they, you know, sink the Bismarck or whatever it is.
[01:29:37.108 --> 01:29:44.173]  And so they already passed a national ID card under Bill Clinton in 1994, and I covered it in my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[01:29:45.113 --> 01:29:47.014]  It's a federally standardizing driver's license.
[01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:49.236]  They didn't get around to telling you that until 2006.
[01:29:49.276 --> 01:29:49.896]  It's the Real ID Act.
[01:29:51.610 --> 01:29:59.956]  Now, though, they're passing separate legislation in banking and immigration where citizens have to have it and then the government's in your bank account.
[01:30:00.156 --> 01:30:06.100]  And that's in the new legislation where the government is just taking money out whenever they want and tracking every deposit and purchase you make.
[01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:08.762]  That's in the banking reform bill.
[01:30:09.423 --> 01:30:10.764]  Again, they always create the crisis.
[01:30:10.844 --> 01:30:12.645]  Their solution is more power for them.
[01:30:13.726 --> 01:30:20.931]  And so, I mean, if they're able to break the border, if they're able to legalize these illegals, because that's the other issue.
[01:30:22.237 --> 01:30:26.689]  If illegals want to take the National ID card, they're instantly nationalized.
[01:30:26.729 --> 01:30:30.319]  They're instantly basically given the green card.
[01:30:31.363 --> 01:30:32.244]  Makes it very easy.
[01:30:32.624 --> 01:30:33.825]  You want it, boom, you got it.
[01:30:34.566 --> 01:30:41.211]  But most of them are smart, unlike the American people, because they've had to be more street smart.
[01:30:41.392 --> 01:30:42.773]  Who can even blame these people?
[01:30:42.793 --> 01:30:44.835]  They're down there in total squalor in police state.
[01:30:45.095 --> 01:30:46.836]  They come up here and the government gives them everything.
[01:30:47.177 --> 01:30:48.658]  They know how to manipulate the system.
[01:30:49.098 --> 01:30:50.459]  And they are left alone.
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:56.545]  If a citizen, black, white, whatever, tried to milk the system like this, Hispanic, American, whatever, it'd be over.
[01:30:57.529 --> 01:31:02.792]  Alright, I said I'd get into the whole racial politic thing and I haven't got into that yet, but I hope that answers your question, Shannon.
[01:31:03.312 --> 01:31:05.953]  What I've been looking for is discrimination lawsuits.
[01:31:06.054 --> 01:31:07.374]  In fact, guys, I can't find it.
[01:31:07.394 --> 01:31:13.137]  Will you reprint me that Knox News article about $105,000?
[01:31:14.078 --> 01:31:15.258]  They pull the illegals over.
[01:31:15.378 --> 01:31:16.259]  They're illegal aliens.
[01:31:16.699 --> 01:31:17.600]  They don't have visas.
[01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:18.820]  They're here illegally.
[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:19.961]  They got $105,000 and they just let them go.
[01:31:23.459 --> 01:31:24.320]  They just let them go.
[01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:27.102]  And I see this all the time.
[01:31:27.542 --> 01:31:36.490]  How does the city of Austin, how does Bank of America take one form of ID, and I've had employees try to go in there, they want three forms to get a bank account.
[01:31:37.691 --> 01:31:42.355]  Why does Austin Energy ask for two forms of ID from a citizen, one form from an illegal?
[01:31:42.835 --> 01:31:46.478]  And it's a consular matricula that you can literally get out of a Cracker Jack box.
[01:31:46.518 --> 01:31:47.459]  They don't even check that.
[01:31:48.646 --> 01:31:50.387]  And I've talked to former Austin Energy employees.
[01:31:50.407 --> 01:31:51.447]  They've had big fights over it.
[01:31:51.807 --> 01:31:52.988]  It's discriminatory.
[01:31:53.708 --> 01:31:57.490]  And so the way to go at this... But see, you can't call ICE.
[01:31:57.750 --> 01:31:59.571]  ICE won't go pick up these illegal aliens.
[01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:04.933]  And if you tried to in Louisiana, the illegals will go burn stuff down, and it won't even be on the news!
[01:32:05.413 --> 01:32:10.435]  That's because, again, they've got the full backing of the banks.
[01:32:11.115 --> 01:32:16.738]  Now, once they've sewed this country up and broken it and driven down the wages, they're going to fully domesticate the illegals.
[01:32:17.398 --> 01:32:31.261]  And they get the added benefit of, once the illegals are in the medical system, they take the shots, they do what they're told, so they'll flop around and die of cancer, and the government will pay for the cancer treatment, which will be taxpayer paid for, when they kill them with the cancer treatment.
[01:32:31.601 --> 01:32:35.322]  So it's just a total system of evil, Shannon.
[01:32:35.342 --> 01:32:36.222]  Does that answer your question?
[01:32:37.642 --> 01:32:38.122]  Yes, sir.
[01:32:38.142 --> 01:32:39.123]  It sure does, Alex.
[01:32:39.183 --> 01:32:40.743]  May I ask you one more question?
[01:32:40.983 --> 01:32:41.243]  Sure.
[01:32:43.804 --> 01:32:45.964]  I refuse to get the national ID card.
[01:32:46.624 --> 01:32:51.931]  And I've got a few other listeners here with me that I'm trying to wake up and talk to.
[01:32:52.953 --> 01:32:55.256]  We refuse to get this ID card.
[01:32:55.376 --> 01:32:56.678]  I understand it's a felony.
[01:32:56.998 --> 01:32:59.402]  But say I walk into a store to buy something.
[01:33:00.177 --> 01:33:02.679]  Now, do I have to have this national ID card to purchase it?
[01:33:02.719 --> 01:33:03.659]  Yes, yes.
[01:33:03.679 --> 01:33:05.921]  They're going to have a VAT, a national sales tax.
[01:33:06.221 --> 01:33:10.803]  It was officially released by the government 12 years ago, or 13 years ago.
[01:33:10.864 --> 01:33:12.665]  Now I've got 98, 12 years ago.
[01:33:13.425 --> 01:33:18.128]  And so, see, it's all going to be selectively enforced.
[01:33:18.708 --> 01:33:23.371]  And again, it's just so evil.
[01:33:23.391 --> 01:33:23.751]  Go ahead.
[01:33:25.172 --> 01:33:25.592]  Yes, sir.
[01:33:28.467 --> 01:33:31.028]  And this health care bill they've got coming out.
[01:33:32.809 --> 01:33:38.872]  If I don't buy that, if I say no to that, I say no to this ridiculous health care bill.
[01:33:38.912 --> 01:33:48.036]  They are going to take it out of your paycheck, seize your bank account, and put you on an arrest warrant list and put you in federal prison.
[01:33:49.537 --> 01:33:50.177]  Bottom line.
[01:34:09.605 --> 01:34:14.308]  So what I've been trying to tell other people, there might be tanks driving up and down the streets here shortly.
[01:34:14.648 --> 01:34:19.331]  Well, they're already giving tanks to every police department in the country, and training them to take on Americans.
[01:34:19.952 --> 01:34:21.093]  Americans are the enemy!
[01:34:21.873 --> 01:34:27.657]  Our government has been seized by offshore banks, and the entire military and police are being trained.
[01:34:27.777 --> 01:34:28.558]  We are the enemy!
[01:34:29.438 --> 01:34:29.979]  Y'all hear this?
[01:34:30.819 --> 01:34:33.101]  I'm talking to the listeners, too, that's listening.
[01:34:33.161 --> 01:34:36.623]  I'm talking with you, and I'm hoping the listeners here are listening to this, too.
[01:34:37.316 --> 01:34:39.798]  I'm doing my best here in Mississippi to wake people up.
[01:34:40.338 --> 01:34:42.139]  Alex, you're doing a superb job.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:44.541]  I applaud you and your staff.
[01:34:45.121 --> 01:34:47.823]  Thank you, sir, and please keep up the good work.
[01:34:47.963 --> 01:34:49.244]  I listen to you every day.
[01:34:49.744 --> 01:34:50.905]  Well, God bless you, my friend.
[01:34:50.925 --> 01:34:54.788]  I'm going to cover the racial programming in the last 30 minutes.
[01:34:54.828 --> 01:34:56.749]  Stuart Rhodes is coming up in 15.
[01:34:57.089 --> 01:34:58.710]  Let's just continue with calls right now.
[01:34:59.551 --> 01:35:01.552]  Let's talk to George in California.
[01:35:01.572 --> 01:35:02.413]  You're on the air, George.
[01:35:03.333 --> 01:35:05.174]  I have a comment and a question.
[01:35:06.607 --> 01:35:11.250]  They correlate directly with what you've been talking about for the last 10 minutes.
[01:35:12.091 --> 01:35:15.053]  I had to kind of write it down because I have bad memory.
[01:35:36.992 --> 01:35:45.975]  And that the people that are against them are racist, and they don't care about them, they don't care about their issues, their families, but Obama loves them, you know?
[01:35:46.575 --> 01:36:01.800]  And that they're gonna have tamales and burritos and stuff, and you know, music and everything, make it like a festival, and the people are there under false pretenses, they don't know really why they're there, they just know that there's a mob, and you know, they're gonna be seen, it's gonna be on the news.
[01:36:02.161 --> 01:36:03.261]  And notice, notice,
[01:36:03.721 --> 01:36:08.103]  The dominant corporate media, the Spanish media, most of it owned by U.S.
[01:36:08.443 --> 01:36:15.966]  and global corporations, and a lot of it owned by big money launderers and drug dealers out of Mexico, that's on record.
[01:36:16.507 --> 01:36:31.193]  Notice that the Spanish-speaking media, the English media, covers up when they burn stuff, when they attack people, but then they tell Americans, Hispanic, black, white, don't be part of the anti-New World Order movement or you're a racist.
[01:36:31.213 --> 01:36:32.394]  They're scared to death of us.
[01:36:33.314 --> 01:36:35.216]  Ever getting together against this.
[01:36:35.256 --> 01:36:38.318]  They're scared to death of us ever reaching out to these people.
[01:36:38.619 --> 01:36:39.940]  They don't know the Ford Foundation.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:47.667]  The federal government taught them about La Raza and Mecha and Aslan and Plan of San Diego and all of this brainwashing.
[01:36:48.487 --> 01:36:52.691]  And so, I mean, it is an emergency situation.
[01:36:52.711 --> 01:36:55.553]  But, I mean, go ahead and make your point.
[01:36:55.573 --> 01:36:55.934]  I'm sorry.
[01:36:56.584 --> 01:37:00.247]  Alright, my question though is on the Arizona law.
[01:37:00.447 --> 01:37:15.278]  I mean, I kind of agree with it, but I don't know where I stand on this because what's going to happen, I mean, when I take my wife and my kids to peaceful demonstrations and to fed rallies, tea parties, what's going to happen when the police look at me and, you know, I look Hispanic,
[01:37:16.279 --> 01:37:17.960]  And they interpret me as a potential danger.
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:21.844]  Everybody knows when the police stops you, it's not a debate.
[01:37:22.104 --> 01:37:24.926]  Even if you're right, it's not a debate.
[01:37:24.946 --> 01:37:27.208]  They're going to tell you how it is.
[01:37:27.248 --> 01:37:27.869]  Let's be clear.
[01:37:28.389 --> 01:37:31.292]  Every major city in Arizona has said they're not going to enforce this.
[01:37:33.193 --> 01:37:38.998]  And the police are not going to just... They will have some staged horror stories.
[01:37:39.861 --> 01:37:46.425]  You know, when the police corner a Hispanic American, Black American, White American, whatever, and violate their rights, it doesn't even make the news.
[01:37:46.766 --> 01:37:50.928]  But believe me, you're going to hear the few horror stories that are out there.
[01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:58.434]  But I mean, you know, that's like saying, if I go to Mexico to some resort, are they going to arrest me as an illegal alien?
[01:37:58.514 --> 01:37:58.754]  No.
[01:37:59.134 --> 01:38:01.356]  But if I fit the profile of a Guatemalan,
[01:38:02.398 --> 01:38:03.078]  Sneaking in.
[01:38:03.599 --> 01:38:05.960]  They're gonna grab me and put me in a political prisoner camp.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:09.002]  I mean, Mexico is hardcore on illegals.
[01:38:09.702 --> 01:38:12.824]  Because, you know, they understand their sovereignty, and I'm not even saying that's a good thing.
[01:38:13.624 --> 01:38:21.449]  Again, this is all much ado about nothing, like the car bomb, you know, and they're acting like it's the end of the world and time's square and we better give all our rights up.
[01:38:21.889 --> 01:38:22.809]  It's a bunch of hype.
[01:38:23.190 --> 01:38:25.351]  The point is, the fed... Look, look.
[01:38:26.397 --> 01:38:31.423]  The way to enforce this, Arizona's just doing this out of desperation, it's not going to be successful.
[01:38:32.044 --> 01:38:33.867]  And it will be a PR nightmare, it already is.
[01:38:34.207 --> 01:38:43.879]  The way to enforce it is, I mean the feds all the time go shake old ladies down for claiming they owe income tax, they don't.
[01:38:44.864 --> 01:38:54.472]  Or the case of Sacramento, a four-cent, in fact, pull that up, a four-cent bill of unpaid taxes from some tax mistake for a car wash.
[01:38:54.632 --> 01:39:00.076]  Headline, four cents to the IRS, you know, causes an armed visit.
[01:39:00.377 --> 01:39:02.598]  And they came and yelled at the guy and were very rude to him.
[01:39:03.079 --> 01:39:04.680]  So see, be rude to the citizen.
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:06.021]  Be rude to the business owner.
[01:39:06.321 --> 01:39:07.722]  Keep that scum in line.
[01:39:07.963 --> 01:39:09.644]  Let them know you're sucking off of them.
[01:39:10.064 --> 01:39:13.968]  But because you want the illegals to drop down the wages, red carpet them.
[01:39:14.728 --> 01:39:25.754]  So the way to enforce it is you start charging business owners with felonies for hiring illegals and they're violating tax laws on top of it.
[01:39:25.774 --> 01:39:28.196]  Most of the time they're doing it because it's under the table cash.
[01:39:28.716 --> 01:39:29.957]  Charge them with tax laws.
[01:39:30.437 --> 01:39:32.498]  You do that, you fix the problem.
[01:39:32.518 --> 01:39:35.600]  I mean there's six billion plus people that want to come here.
[01:39:36.411 --> 01:39:38.212]  And we can't have them all here.
[01:39:38.312 --> 01:39:41.413]  And even if we did have them all here, we've got a welfare system.
[01:39:41.733 --> 01:39:42.693]  It's bankrupting us.
[01:39:42.713 --> 01:39:43.733]  You know, stay there, George.
[01:39:43.793 --> 01:39:45.354]  I want to get your response to what I just said.
[01:39:46.154 --> 01:39:47.754]  Nobody's going to grab you and your wife.
[01:39:47.894 --> 01:39:49.095]  Well, actually, that's not true.
[01:39:49.395 --> 01:39:53.936]  They have 100-mile-in border checkpoints where they harass citizens all over the country.
[01:39:54.136 --> 01:39:55.937]  If you're white, look out, because we're scum.
[01:39:56.741 --> 01:39:59.324]  Times are tough and you gotta stretch that dollar.

[01:41:06.207 --> 01:41:08.410]  It really says that the state is God.

[01:43:18.507 --> 01:43:19.987]  They just roll right on through.
[01:43:20.587 --> 01:43:21.808]  Here's the Sacramento Bee.
[01:43:22.048 --> 01:43:25.049]  IRS visits Sacramento car wash in pursuit of four cents.
[01:43:25.649 --> 01:43:28.231]  They talk about how rude they were to him, how they got in their face.
[01:43:28.251 --> 01:43:30.052]  I want to get this car wash owner on.
[01:43:30.072 --> 01:43:37.276]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff, because they want the enforcers out there, whether you believe in the law or not, it's a fraud, unconstitutional.
[01:43:37.917 --> 01:43:39.838]  They don't go after the big money people.
[01:43:39.878 --> 01:43:44.001]  They go after the low-level people to keep us in line.
[01:43:44.997 --> 01:43:45.598]  Now, it's simple.
[01:43:46.198 --> 01:43:58.531]  If you're a citizen, no matter what color you are, what religion, or if you're an illegal here, more illegals is going to hurt your job rate, it's going to hurt your employment, it's going to hurt your future, and it's going to bankrupt this country.
[01:43:59.031 --> 01:44:03.957]  And so, yeah, it's an ugly situation, but the globalists are for open borders.
[01:44:05.302 --> 01:44:06.243]  That's all I need to know.
[01:44:06.684 --> 01:44:07.725]  Then I go look at the evidence.
[01:44:08.085 --> 01:44:09.126]  I'm right to be against him.
[01:44:09.627 --> 01:44:11.970]  Anything the globalists are for is a fraud.
[01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:16.094]  Anything the mainstream media is pushing, no matter how they dress it up, is a fraud.
[01:44:16.943 --> 01:44:18.464]  This is a criminal system.
[01:44:18.764 --> 01:44:23.268]  It's 180 degrees, the opposite direction of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:44:23.328 --> 01:44:24.269]  So, let me be clear.
[01:44:24.309 --> 01:44:31.295]  You go to Arizona and you argue with them and they want to search your car 75 miles over the border or 100 miles, they're going to knock your teeth out.
[01:44:31.955 --> 01:44:32.275]  Okay?
[01:44:33.176 --> 01:44:34.697]  Now, that's what goes on.
[01:44:35.218 --> 01:44:36.599]  My grandfather, he's dead now.
[01:44:36.619 --> 01:44:45.066]  I remember him complaining back when I was in college that he was out driving around the hill country and got pulled over by border patrol 200 miles from the border.
[01:44:46.086 --> 01:44:48.668]  I mean, he's a white guy.
[01:44:49.288 --> 01:44:50.649]  German ancestry.
[01:44:51.029 --> 01:44:52.550]  So this is going on.
[01:44:52.630 --> 01:44:56.672]  Of course they're going to use this to run checkpoints and have a police state.
[01:44:56.692 --> 01:44:58.233]  Of course it's going to be against everybody.
[01:44:58.753 --> 01:45:00.554]  That's why it's probably not the way to do it.
[01:45:01.174 --> 01:45:01.695]  But if you do...
[01:45:02.495 --> 01:45:03.996]  Yes, another thing I wanted to say regarding that
[01:45:26.596 --> 01:45:30.117]  I'm just really torn because I want them to enforce the law.
[01:45:30.297 --> 01:45:34.858]  We don't need any more laws that nobody follows.
[01:45:36.579 --> 01:45:42.341]  I want them to enforce it, but if they enforce it, they're kind of infringing on my rights because I am Mexican, I am brown.
[01:45:43.101 --> 01:45:50.303]  But if they don't enforce it, if they do enforce it, what's going to happen?
[01:45:50.343 --> 01:45:51.503]  They're going to take away my...
[01:45:54.492 --> 01:45:57.894]  You're protesting, you're at the end of the Fed, you're anti-government.
[01:45:57.955 --> 01:46:00.056]  They're going to take my kids away.
[01:46:00.076 --> 01:46:02.058]  I have a traditional relationship with my wife.
[01:46:02.098 --> 01:46:07.303]  Then they come in and they tell you that your relationship is not right, that you're a machismo.
[01:46:10.245 --> 01:46:11.346]  Oh yeah, that's the new thing.
[01:46:11.446 --> 01:46:15.167]  It's abusive if the woman stays home with the kids because the state owns those kids.
[01:46:15.387 --> 01:46:16.308]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:46:16.828 --> 01:46:28.533]  You know, my wife speaks Spanish because she lived in Spain, and I mean certainly you're aware of the Aslan movement, the signs these people have got, and the fact that a lot of these illegals have been taught that the Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[01:46:28.553 --> 01:46:33.775]  I am aware of that, but I also know my people very well.
[01:46:33.795 --> 01:46:38.617]  I mean, I have twelve uncles, you know, and I know that they work
[01:46:39.130 --> 01:46:40.771]  They get home from work and they're tired.
[01:46:40.831 --> 01:46:50.519]  Most of them, most of the people that I know will not go out there unless they're told, unless it's propagandized, unless it's hyped up, they're going to have music, they're going to have food and stuff.
[01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:55.363]  And the people, most of the people, especially immigrants, they don't speak the language, so they don't know.
[01:46:55.804 --> 01:47:02.089]  So they just get out there and they think that it's, you know, they're fighting the racists, they're fighting the white guy, and it's not like that.
[01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.850]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:07.934]  They're out there under false pretenses, but the media goes out there and then, you know, they put that out there.
[01:47:08.694 --> 01:47:09.275]  Exactly.
[01:47:09.295 --> 01:47:15.720]  The globalists have created a situation that's meant to have us all divided and conquered, fighting with each other.
[01:47:16.081 --> 01:47:17.582]  But it's a real threat.
[01:47:17.942 --> 01:47:18.643]  It's illegal.
[01:47:18.983 --> 01:47:20.224]  It's unconstitutional.
[01:47:20.604 --> 01:47:21.665]  So what do you do?
[01:47:22.346 --> 01:47:26.689]  Again, bottom line, it is going to hurt you and your family if this continues.
[01:47:27.190 --> 01:47:28.311]  And it must be reversed.
[01:47:28.351 --> 01:47:32.134]  And we have to have a national debate and discussion about this, George.
[01:47:32.494 --> 01:47:33.535]  I appreciate your call.
[01:47:33.775 --> 01:47:34.276]  Stay with us.
[01:47:36.881 --> 01:47:42.042]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:47:42.603 --> 01:47:45.903]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:46.904 --> 01:47:49.504]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:47:49.924 --> 01:47:54.886]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:47:55.246 --> 01:47:56.986]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:47:57.286 --> 01:48:02.127]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:48:02.287 --> 01:48:03.268]  How much do you want?
[01:48:03.488 --> 01:48:04.208]  When do you want it?
[01:48:04.588 --> 01:48:06.189]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:48:06.489 --> 01:48:07.309]  When will you need it?
[01:48:07.549 --> 01:48:09.630]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:10.850]  Will there be any food?
[01:48:11.091 --> 01:48:12.431]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:48:12.631 --> 01:48:17.693]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:48:17.893 --> 01:48:21.074]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:48:21.475 --> 01:48:24.936]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:48:25.296 --> 01:48:26.277]  How much will you need?
[01:48:26.517 --> 01:48:27.138]  We don't know.
[01:48:27.418 --> 01:48:28.339]  How much do you want?
[01:48:28.519 --> 01:48:29.259]  All you can get.
[01:48:29.459 --> 01:48:30.300]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:33.303]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:48:33.603 --> 01:48:33.963]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:48:34.123 --> 01:48:35.764]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:48:35.785 --> 01:48:36.785]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:48:36.805 --> 01:48:37.966]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:48:38.006 --> 01:48:39.848]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:49:07.939 --> 01:49:21.409]  We've got the founder of Oath Keepers, former staffer of Ron Paul, ex-paratrooper, disabled vet, firearms instructor.
[01:49:23.611 --> 01:49:27.674]  Former Ron Paul staff member, Yale Law grad, research scholar.
[01:49:29.369 --> 01:49:31.451]  And Montana, Nevada lawyer.
[01:49:32.292 --> 01:49:34.734]  And he's camping with friends in Utah.
[01:49:35.414 --> 01:49:37.216]  I love to be camping in Monument Valley, boy.
[01:49:37.736 --> 01:49:39.037]  That is so beautiful out there.
[01:49:40.359 --> 01:49:43.021]  And he is with us for the next 30 minutes.
[01:49:43.061 --> 01:49:45.023]  He also writes a column for SWAT Magazine.
[01:49:46.161 --> 01:49:50.425]  He has had the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center imply that he's a terrorist.
[01:49:50.785 --> 01:49:54.429]  Mother Jones said that he's involved in treason and sedition.
[01:49:55.189 --> 01:50:02.236]  And all they're calling for is for the troops and military to follow their oath and not confiscate our firearms and be part of this New World Order.
[01:50:02.676 --> 01:50:06.359]  But I also wanted to get him on today because of a Raw Story interview he did.
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:11.103]  It says, oath keepers, founders, slams, conservative media, hypocrisy.
[01:50:11.444 --> 01:50:13.565]  So we've got him on about that as well.
[01:50:13.585 --> 01:50:14.906]  We'll talk about it in the next segment.
[01:50:15.487 --> 01:50:26.155]  But on the subject of the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center and Mayor Bloomberg trying to say that the car bomb dud in Times Square Saturday that he thinks it's people that are against health care, government takeover of health care.
[01:50:26.976 --> 01:50:29.258]  I mean, it's just amazing what they're doing, Stuart.
[01:50:29.298 --> 01:50:30.559]  We must be getting under their skin.
[01:50:31.892 --> 01:50:32.372]  Absolutely.
[01:50:32.392 --> 01:50:35.994]  You know, you get a lot of flack when you're right on top of the target is how it goes.
[01:50:36.474 --> 01:50:41.116]  And I'm proud to be on the Senate Political Law Center's list of patriots.
[01:50:42.056 --> 01:50:45.517]  Right there with Ron Paul and Judge Napolitano, I'm in good company.
[01:50:46.858 --> 01:50:47.478]  Absolutely.
[01:50:47.498 --> 01:50:50.459]  And of course, yours truly, I'm on there as particularly evil.
[01:50:50.539 --> 01:50:51.019]  That's right.
[01:50:51.079 --> 01:50:51.480]  That's right.
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:51.880]  You are.
[01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:52.440]  That's right.
[01:50:53.849 --> 01:50:56.051]  And we're on the White House enemies list as well.
[01:50:56.811 --> 01:50:58.753]  I mean, this is really an act of desperation.
[01:50:58.773 --> 01:51:05.277]  They're trying to divide the American people by saying, you know, if you say the sky's blue, you're a racist.
[01:51:06.658 --> 01:51:14.204]  And Obama gave a commencement speech last week where all he talked about was, don't be angry, do what the government says.
[01:51:14.504 --> 01:51:15.485]  They're really concerned.
[01:51:17.057 --> 01:51:24.362]  Absolutely, and as you said, if you just quote the founding fathers and stick to the Constitution, that's a threat to them.
[01:51:24.782 --> 01:51:27.824]  And so they're going to try to demonize you, but they're jumping the shark now.
[01:51:28.285 --> 01:51:29.846]  I mean, it's getting to be absurd.
[01:51:29.866 --> 01:51:33.588]  Oath Keepers is just exploding.
[01:51:33.628 --> 01:51:37.631]  It seems like it's backfired on them in the few years since you founded the organization.
[01:51:37.651 --> 01:51:39.833]  Now it's just all over the place.
[01:51:41.021 --> 01:51:41.881]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:51:42.161 --> 01:51:53.145]  Every time they attack us, like they had recently, they had Bill Clinton of all people attacking those keepers by name, mentioning us along with three percenters, the gun owners, in a speech and in several interviews.
[01:51:53.605 --> 01:51:57.247]  So when they're starting to hurl ex-presidents at you, I think you're doing something right.
[01:51:57.827 --> 01:52:02.669]  So I think they're just afraid of the Constitution and they're afraid of our message and trying to shut us up.
[01:52:02.729 --> 01:52:03.509]  It's just not going to work.
[01:52:03.871 --> 01:52:12.256]  Well, Bill Clinton two weeks ago said the Tea Party people are going to cause another Oklahoma City, and when it happens, it's going to be your fault.
[01:52:12.817 --> 01:52:15.478]  I think when another Oklahoma City happens, we better look at Bill Clinton.
[01:52:15.498 --> 01:52:17.800]  I mean, that's a frame up in the making.
[01:52:19.272 --> 01:52:20.153]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[01:52:20.433 --> 01:52:24.737]  And one thing to keep in mind also, look who was sponsoring the event he was speaking at.
[01:52:25.077 --> 01:52:27.199]  It was a George Soros-sponsored event.
[01:52:27.639 --> 01:52:34.765]  And these are, you know, he's the mouthpiece and the puppet, but the people who are pulling the strings are far higher up, as you know.
[01:52:34.986 --> 01:52:36.147]  And who is George Soros?
[01:52:36.187 --> 01:52:41.031]  He's one of the big investment bankers involved in all the derivatives, robbing us seven ways of Sunday.
[01:52:42.301 --> 01:52:43.322]  Right, and it's both parties.
[01:52:43.722 --> 01:52:45.823]  That's why I gave the interview the raw story.
[01:52:46.183 --> 01:52:50.986]  I said, look, you know, there are conservatives who are sincere and are real constitutionalists.
[01:52:51.426 --> 01:52:55.268]  That's the grassroots of the Tea Party movement.
[01:52:55.288 --> 01:52:56.669]  I have the most respect for them.
[01:52:56.969 --> 01:53:02.332]  But all the fake ones, all the neocons, I have other contempt for them, but no respect for them whatsoever.
[01:53:03.049 --> 01:53:04.150]  Well, we're about to break.
[01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:25.120]  Let's come back and go over the points that you made there, because absolutely, Oath Keepers was founded against the Patriot Act, what happened in Katrina, you've been very critical of Bush, so has Ron Paul, who you worked for, and the media has spun it and said basically you're some type of Republican operative, so I'm glad you're out there explaining this, because when the Republicans come back into power,
[01:53:26.087 --> 01:53:29.229]  We're going to be right back in the same situation because they're owned by the same people.
[01:53:29.249 --> 01:53:34.893]  I want to get your idea of how we get that message out so we can have real change in this country.
[01:53:34.913 --> 01:53:36.454]  Stuart Rhodes is our guest.
[01:53:36.875 --> 01:53:42.238]  We'll give you the Oath Keepers website and a lot more on the other side of this quick break.
[01:53:42.258 --> 01:53:50.925]  We'll have Stuart Rhodes talk about what the Oath Keepers actually stands for, the ten things they promise to not violate, so you can make a decision for yourself.
[01:53:51.665 --> 01:53:52.306]  Are they evil?
[01:53:52.406 --> 01:53:53.607]  Is George Washington bad?
[01:53:53.627 --> 01:53:55.368]  According to the federal government, yes.
[01:53:56.465 --> 01:54:00.286]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:54:55.925 --> 01:54:58.228]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:54:58.248 --> 01:55:00.530]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:55:00.630 --> 01:55:03.814]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:55:03.834 --> 01:55:08.600]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:13.145]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:55:13.445 --> 01:55:15.769]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:55:15.789 --> 01:55:18.313]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:55:18.333 --> 01:55:21.237]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:55:21.597 --> 01:55:29.209]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:55:29.522 --> 01:55:34.785]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:55:34.805 --> 01:55:37.666]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:55:37.766 --> 01:55:41.208]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:55:41.448 --> 01:55:42.369]  And I got news for you.
[01:55:42.529 --> 01:55:43.830]  You're everyone else.
[01:55:43.870 --> 01:55:44.910]  Invisible Empire.

[01:55:55.834 --> 01:55:57.074]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:55:57.134 --> 01:56:02.476]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:56:02.716 --> 01:56:07.338]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:56:07.738 --> 01:56:08.138]  It's true.
[01:56:08.198 --> 01:56:12.760]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:18.003]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:56:18.524 --> 01:56:20.445]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:56:20.845 --> 01:56:25.448]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:56:25.648 --> 01:56:26.549]  And here's the best part.
[01:56:26.749 --> 01:56:29.531]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:56:29.831 --> 01:56:33.133]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:56:33.454 --> 01:56:36.295]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:56:36.636 --> 01:56:38.537]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:56:38.857 --> 01:56:39.778]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:56:44.781 --> 01:56:47.123]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:56:47.663 --> 01:56:52.166]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:56:52.486 --> 01:56:54.868]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:56:58.286 --> 01:57:04.308]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:57:04.908 --> 01:57:07.948]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:08.389 --> 01:57:16.411]  This nation is being criminally and unconstitutionally absorbed by private central banks that are looting every major country on the planet.
[01:57:16.711 --> 01:57:17.811]  They want to destroy borders,
[01:57:18.371 --> 01:57:22.512]  Destroy constitutions that protect private property and the right to self-defense.
[01:57:22.552 --> 01:57:24.173]  This is their stated goal.
[01:57:24.553 --> 01:57:28.074]  This is economic conquest backed up with military conquest.
[01:57:28.394 --> 01:57:38.097]  Two new films that came out in the last month available on DVD at InfoWars.com that are so important to get in the hands of the American people and your purchase supports our operation here.
[01:57:38.597 --> 01:57:44.259]  Invisible Empire New Order Defined defines who the globalists are, their history, their master plan, their crimes.
[01:57:45.459 --> 01:57:59.191]  And police state, the rise of FEMA, a year in the making, Chronicles, the physical force they've been setting up, training for gun confiscation, confiscating guns, military checkpoints popping up everywhere, training the military to take on the American people.
[01:57:59.691 --> 01:58:08.199]  It is so important to get both these videos and make copies and air them on AXS TV and give them to your pastor, give them to your employees, give them to your boss, get it out to everyone you know.
[01:58:08.459 --> 01:58:13.865]  Infowars.com, the online video bookstore, or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:58:14.085 --> 01:58:17.709]  We've got Stuart Rhodes, who came on on short notice.
[01:58:17.729 --> 01:58:20.632]  He's on a vacation with his friends, camping in Utah.
[01:58:20.892 --> 01:58:25.237]  The founder of Oath Keepers, Yale Law graduate, Army paratrooper.
[01:58:25.937 --> 01:58:34.221]  One of Ron Paul's staff members founded Oath Keepers because of the militarization of police, the gun confiscation training that was going on during Bush.
[01:58:34.622 --> 01:58:42.105]  The media has tried to basically, well, Mother Jones said sedition is treasonous traitors, just absolute defamation.
[01:58:42.526 --> 01:58:47.148]  And I want to get into this interview he did with Raw Story that we've got linked up on InfoWars.com.
[01:58:47.648 --> 01:58:48.729]  Oath Keeper founders
[01:58:49.389 --> 01:59:15.328]  uh... slam conservative media hypocrisy you can actually go to Oath Keepers dot org and actually read what they really stand for and why the system is so threatened by them but we've had the Southern Poverty Law Center uh... Stewart attack us, we've had the ADL attack us and Ron Paul and Judge Napolitano and yourself and myself and say we're calling for violence and imply we're enabling terrorists and just just just asinine tyranny
[01:59:15.908 --> 01:59:23.933]  Meanwhile, illegal aliens rioted in Santa Cruz, set fire to a restaurant with torches, knocked out the windows of more than 20 businesses.
[01:59:24.354 --> 01:59:25.735]  No national news coverage.
[01:59:26.075 --> 01:59:32.099]  Bloomberg's trying to blame the Tea Party for the failed truck bomb, even though they've already arrested a Pakistani.
[01:59:34.503 --> 01:59:36.386]  in New York.
[01:59:37.087 --> 01:59:43.395]  I mean, you're an American, so you don't even want me to make this point, because black, white, Hispanic, doesn't matter, but you're half Hispanic.
[01:59:43.776 --> 01:59:50.906]  What do you think about the fact that they're really trying, from my point of view, to stir up racial tensions in this country?
[01:59:51.906 --> 01:59:53.648]  Well sure, it's all part of divide and conquer.
[01:59:54.088 --> 01:59:57.711]  And they don't pay attention to anybody else's threats.
[01:59:58.052 --> 02:00:03.617]  The only thing they find to be a threat is Americanism, is bedrock constitutionalism.
[02:00:04.037 --> 02:00:05.238]  That is their great enemy.
[02:00:05.618 --> 02:00:08.861]  It's like Dracula being afraid of garlic or the cross.
[02:00:09.262 --> 02:00:16.228]  That's what they fear more than anything else, is that Americans will come together on the bedrock common ground of the Bill of Rights.
[02:00:16.588 --> 02:00:17.610]  They don't want you to do that.
[02:00:17.630 --> 02:00:18.952]  They want to divide and conquer.
[02:00:19.172 --> 02:00:20.474]  Police against the citizens.
[02:00:20.534 --> 02:00:21.495]  Black against white.
[02:00:21.796 --> 02:00:22.717]  Brown against white.
[02:00:22.737 --> 02:00:23.919]  They want you all dividing.
[02:00:24.419 --> 02:00:25.641]  You know, left versus right.
[02:00:25.962 --> 02:00:29.707]  They want you to divide and fight amongst yourselves so you don't see what they're doing.
[02:00:29.727 --> 02:00:30.909]  They're destroying the republic.
[02:00:32.011 --> 02:00:32.271]  They are.
[02:00:32.291 --> 02:00:36.152]  Let me bring up one more point on this issue and then get into so-called right-wing hypocrisy.
[02:00:37.332 --> 02:00:42.194]  I don't know if you saw this, it just came out Friday, but I know you've seen all the other confirmed drills and reports.
[02:00:43.634 --> 02:00:58.138]  They're training Brigade Homeland and the National Guard in drill scenarios where the Tea Party is going to attack military and police, and in the drills they describe us as drunken, racist, and they even talk about taking us to detention centers.
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:01.341]  I mean, this is really scary.
[02:01:01.641 --> 02:01:07.868]  What type of reports are you getting from all of your Oath Keeper members in the military and law enforcement on this front?
[02:01:09.158 --> 02:01:10.439]  The parallel is going on.
[02:01:10.459 --> 02:01:11.620]  It's no accident.
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:20.028]  I think it's total hogwash and a whitewash to say that one officer inserted that scenario into the Fort Knox training.
[02:01:20.088 --> 02:01:21.109]  That's just nonsense.
[02:01:21.489 --> 02:01:23.571]  We're getting feedback that they are being trained.
[02:01:24.231 --> 02:01:33.460]  Multiple reserve units from both Marine Corps and Army are telling us they're being trained by command of DORFCOM for domestic disturbances.
[02:01:34.180 --> 02:01:36.942]  And it's not because it's some kind of future hypothetical.
[02:01:37.302 --> 02:01:39.363]  It's because there's something coming down the pike.
[02:01:39.724 --> 02:01:41.044]  And they know this.
[02:01:41.104 --> 02:01:48.069]  And the gut feeling among the troops is that they don't like the training they're being given and they understand that it's for something short term.
[02:01:48.429 --> 02:01:49.850]  It's not just way in the future.
[02:01:50.290 --> 02:02:00.836]  And we have a two-star general retired who just retired last year who's going to go do some looking around and he's talking to other current serving general officers.
[02:02:01.237 --> 02:02:03.358]  And so we're hoping to get some feedback from him this next week.
[02:02:03.888 --> 02:02:06.890]  Well, please sir, break down the type of intel you're getting.
[02:02:06.910 --> 02:02:32.623]  I mean, we know in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, passed in 2007 and concurrently the three years after it, it states NORTHCOM is for domestic disturbances, and even putting down governors and states that say no to the feds, and we see Hardball with Slimeball Matthews and others saying that, you know, Obama may have to be like Lincoln, and that the federalism issue has been settled
[02:02:33.285 --> 02:02:34.473]  Via the Civil War.
[02:02:34.533 --> 02:02:35.500]  I mean, this is serious.
[02:02:36.792 --> 02:02:51.121]  Absolutely, and what NORTHCOM has done is hand-in-hand with FEMA, has done an end-run around the states and divided the country up into the 10 zones under FEMA, which are the same 10 zones under NORTHCOM, and now with the Council of Governors.
[02:02:51.741 --> 02:03:06.350]  It's putting in place a shadow government infrastructure that during emergencies they can just bypass the states, nullify the state governors, and just under the reign of FEMA, mesh with NORTHCOM together.
[02:03:06.730 --> 02:03:07.751]  That's what's happening.
[02:03:08.092 --> 02:03:12.937]  They're setting this up and now the training is becoming much more focused and much more overt.
[02:03:13.558 --> 02:03:15.500]  But the thing is, is the troops don't like it either.
[02:03:16.341 --> 02:03:21.246]  As you heard on the call that you've been getting from active duty, they don't like this.
[02:03:21.286 --> 02:03:22.288]  They understand what's happening.
[02:03:22.308 --> 02:03:23.309]  That's the big difference.
[02:03:23.829 --> 02:03:27.393]  They're not able to just pull the wool over the current serving's eyes.
[02:03:28.234 --> 02:03:29.234]  And that's checkmate.
[02:03:29.414 --> 02:03:31.955]  I mean, tyranny will come to your door in a uniform.
[02:03:32.296 --> 02:03:34.036]  We don't want to fight the military and police.
[02:03:34.056 --> 02:03:38.738]  We want them to relearn their oath, commit and decide what side they're on.
[02:03:39.398 --> 02:03:45.961]  Clearly, the financial collapse is what Ron Paul believes they're getting ready for open martial law and an attack on Iran.
[02:03:47.321 --> 02:03:49.042]  So this is very, very serious.
[02:03:49.082 --> 02:03:52.063]  If they attack Iran, they're not going to need to stage attacks.
[02:03:52.083 --> 02:03:53.664]  There's going to be real attacks.
[02:03:54.404 --> 02:03:56.908]  And then we get the internal MYAC and Homeland Security reports.
[02:03:56.948 --> 02:04:02.296]  Two weeks ago, the head of the FBI, Robert Mueller, said the new threat is the American people.
[02:04:02.477 --> 02:04:08.827]  Well, we've known with the internal docs for eight years, the full focus of this has been on we the people.
[02:04:10.091 --> 02:04:12.654]  Absolutely, and we're seeing that even within upkeepers.
[02:04:12.954 --> 02:04:18.259]  We've got now confirmation that basically the FBI and ATF are being picked on us.
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:28.270]  And they're being told to go out and find a way to feign us as a militia, find a way to make us look bad in the eyes of the current military.
[02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:30.651]  Of course it's happening to you too.
[02:04:31.011 --> 02:04:36.653]  All these fear campaigns are being done against anyone who speaks up, anyone who stands for the Constitution.
[02:04:36.994 --> 02:04:43.396]  It's not done against fake conservatives, against the neocons, only done against true constitutionalists.
[02:04:43.416 --> 02:04:44.917]  Because we are their actual enemy.
[02:04:45.489 --> 02:04:51.891]  Yeah, let's talk about, well, first let me just get any other intel that's important that you're getting from the troops right now.
[02:04:51.911 --> 02:04:52.991]  I mean, we have the documents.
[02:04:53.051 --> 02:04:54.531]  It's not just the phone calls.
[02:04:54.772 --> 02:05:03.554]  We know what's going on, but specifically, what percentage is a dead reckoning of the forces you're talking to are really waking up to what's happening?
[02:05:04.787 --> 02:05:05.707]  Well, it's tough to say.
[02:05:05.727 --> 02:05:07.128]  I mean, it's kind of like an iceberg.
[02:05:07.168 --> 02:05:10.709]  We're really here, you know, from a tip, and there's a great mass beneath.
[02:05:11.049 --> 02:05:16.310]  But you hear so many different pings from so many different directions that, you know, the big picture starts to come together.
[02:05:16.650 --> 02:05:19.271]  But basically, they don't like the training they're getting.
[02:05:19.591 --> 02:05:20.971]  They understand what it's for.
[02:05:21.272 --> 02:05:26.253]  They understand that it's predominantly for coming economic collapse.
[02:05:26.413 --> 02:05:29.774]  And so, and in fact, another story we heard is that
[02:05:31.003 --> 02:05:43.710]  There are police who told us that during their training, they were told by prior military, I can't tell you who, but just prior military, that an economic collapse is coming, the government is aware of it, and the government is preparing for it.
[02:05:43.730 --> 02:05:44.571]  Of course, you know that.
[02:05:44.891 --> 02:05:49.033]  But the average police officer is stunned by this news.
[02:05:49.113 --> 02:05:56.297]  And so when they hear that for the first time, from very credible military personnel, who, you know, in private conversations between
[02:05:57.498 --> 02:05:58.699]  We're good to go.
[02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:28.546]  Well, you're absolutely right, and we have the internal Goldman Sachs and other documents where it was engineered by design.
[02:06:28.626 --> 02:06:36.775]  I had Greg Pallast, BBC reporter on, who got the internal IMF documents, where they plan to cause riots as a pretext to come in and take over.
[02:06:38.337 --> 02:06:39.158]  Well, I don't see that.
[02:06:39.298 --> 02:06:40.019]  I'd like to see that.
[02:06:40.842 --> 02:06:41.523]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:06:41.563 --> 02:06:46.286]  Well, that actually came out in 2002, but absolutely.
[02:06:46.306 --> 02:06:47.747]  We had Greg Palast on yesterday.
[02:06:48.087 --> 02:06:54.851]  Now, expanding on this, on Tea Party Day, you cancelled an event in D.C.
[02:06:54.931 --> 02:06:56.192]  because of provocateurs.
[02:06:56.212 --> 02:06:56.893]  Tell us about that.
[02:06:57.844 --> 02:06:59.366]  Well, it wasn't so much provocateurs.
[02:06:59.406 --> 02:07:01.088]  We canceled because it was off our mission.
[02:07:01.569 --> 02:07:07.076]  I mean, as I said at the press conference I gave in D.C., we have the utmost respect.
[02:07:07.096 --> 02:07:10.460]  In fact, Daniel Allman, the organizer of that event, is an Oath Keeper.
[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:12.322]  He was one of our guys in Georgia.
[02:07:12.643 --> 02:07:14.185]  And so I have the utmost respect for him.
[02:07:15.025 --> 02:07:21.446]  But the rhetoric started to shift from being just an open carry event, which is fine, and started to be much more confrontational.
[02:07:21.806 --> 02:07:30.688]  But I did say, look, it's important for the government to get that message, that there are people out there who are not going to just, you know, roll over and give up their liberty.
[02:07:30.728 --> 02:07:32.249]  They're willing to fight if they have to.
[02:07:32.609 --> 02:07:36.389]  I think it's an important message for the government to get, but it's not the ultimate message.
[02:07:36.469 --> 02:07:38.870]  Our mission is to focus on the people within the government.
[02:07:39.290 --> 02:07:43.051]  And they can use counter-terrorism funds to really run an operation against you.
[02:08:08.466 --> 02:08:08.906]  Absolutely.
[02:08:08.926 --> 02:08:11.787]  We don't want to make ourselves vulnerable to that, so that's why we didn't do it.
[02:08:11.827 --> 02:08:17.690]  I've got a lot of flack for it, but hey, I want to take my lumps and whatever I've got to deal with to stay on mission.
[02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:19.510]  My focus is on the current serving.
[02:08:19.871 --> 02:08:25.413]  And my message to the people out there who are, you know, they want us to become, you know, they want us to actually become like a militia.
[02:08:25.433 --> 02:08:31.795]  They want Oath Keepers to stand up and go stop government abuse or go stand on the front lines and do this or that.
[02:08:32.135 --> 02:08:36.057]  And my message to them is, hey, do you want the police and military on your side or not?
[02:08:36.617 --> 02:08:38.579]  If you do, let me do my mission.
[02:08:38.699 --> 02:08:39.740]  You go do your mission.
[02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:41.321]  I'm not going to knock what you're using.
[02:08:41.481 --> 02:08:42.022]  Exactly.
[02:08:42.082 --> 02:08:45.364]  We don't need people telling you what to do or what I should do.
[02:08:45.865 --> 02:08:47.406]  You know, they want to go out and do that.
[02:08:47.666 --> 02:08:48.807]  Go ahead, John Wayne.
[02:08:48.827 --> 02:08:49.828]  You've got all the answers.
[02:08:50.088 --> 02:08:54.512]  We need soft power to come in and take this country back gently.
[02:08:58.146 --> 02:09:01.288]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:09:01.528 --> 02:09:09.532]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.

[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:27.584]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:09:27.744 --> 02:09:32.148]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:09:32.308 --> 02:09:38.033]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[02:09:38.133 --> 02:09:41.476]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:09:41.756 --> 02:09:44.359]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:09:44.479 --> 02:09:49.385]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[02:09:56.898 --> 02:09:57.999]  Are you prepared?
[02:09:58.259 --> 02:10:00.361]  Well, you need to be hardcore prepared.
[02:10:00.581 --> 02:10:01.622]  There is a difference.

[02:10:48.531 --> 02:10:49.091]  Again, that's 418-844-9111.
[02:10:56.690 --> 02:10:58.993]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:10:59.073 --> 02:11:01.296]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:11:01.396 --> 02:11:04.160]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:11:04.601 --> 02:11:09.347]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:11:09.707 --> 02:11:13.913]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:11:14.213 --> 02:11:16.535]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:11:16.555 --> 02:11:19.077]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:11:19.097 --> 02:11:22.019]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:29.966]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:11:30.286 --> 02:11:35.531]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:11:35.691 --> 02:11:38.493]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:11:38.533 --> 02:11:41.976]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:11:42.216 --> 02:11:43.137]  And I got news for you.
[02:11:43.297 --> 02:11:44.598]  You're everyone else.
[02:11:44.638 --> 02:11:45.639]  Invisible Empire.

[02:11:55.948 --> 02:11:57.849]  Hi, this is Steve Schenke, Foods Direct.
[02:11:58.069 --> 02:12:03.311]  We have stopped taking orders for the Buy 3 Get 1 Free program and have started production.
[02:12:03.492 --> 02:12:04.532]  Congratulations!
[02:12:04.812 --> 02:12:10.895]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food supply by pre-ordering will prove very wise.
[02:12:11.275 --> 02:12:13.036]  Shipments will begin the end of March.
[02:12:13.576 --> 02:12:16.018]  And we'll be sent in the order that they were received.
[02:12:16.318 --> 02:12:17.219]  Now, something fun.
[02:12:17.439 --> 02:12:18.239]  It's springtime.
[02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:26.105]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[02:12:26.325 --> 02:12:27.066]  Here's the plan.
[02:12:27.206 --> 02:12:35.792]  When you add a one-month Superfood Spring Pack to your food storage, we'll send you that garden of non-hybrid seeds absolutely free.
[02:12:36.132 --> 02:12:38.013]  Order now while the free seeds last.
[02:12:38.454 --> 02:12:38.694]  Call 800-409-500.
[02:12:45.045 --> 02:12:48.970]  Get a real supply of food to eat while you wait for your supplemental garden to grow.
[02:12:49.110 --> 02:12:49.390]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:13:03.536 --> 02:13:05.899]  Stuart Rhodes, the founder of Oath Keepers, is our guest.
[02:13:05.939 --> 02:13:06.860]  We'll have about 40 after.
[02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:13.607]  Then I want to play a clip of a black studies professor saying exterminate the entire white race.
[02:13:13.747 --> 02:13:15.068]  Well, that's just part of the human race.
[02:13:15.869 --> 02:13:19.673]  But I want to illustrate how you've got some of the white supremacists saying this.
[02:13:19.693 --> 02:13:21.555]  You've got black groups, Hispanic groups saying it.
[02:13:22.256 --> 02:13:25.677]  I want to explain how tribalism works, how the globalists manipulate us through this.
[02:13:25.697 --> 02:13:26.737]  We're going back to Stuart Rhodes.
[02:13:27.097 --> 02:13:29.738]  The next segment, we're opening the phones up just for Stuart Rhodes.
[02:13:29.778 --> 02:13:30.478]  Take a few calls.
[02:13:30.498 --> 02:13:31.118]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:13:31.158 --> 02:13:43.381]  And I'm not saying everybody, Stuart, that's trying to get you to, you know, become this organization that gets the military to go out and confront people.
[02:13:43.901 --> 02:13:47.122]  But the minute you, I mean, obviously get military,
[02:13:47.902 --> 02:13:50.445]  Active duty to start going out and confronting people.
[02:13:50.685 --> 02:13:52.147]  They will call that sedition.
[02:13:52.767 --> 02:13:54.910]  And I'll guarantee you that's provocateurs.
[02:13:54.930 --> 02:14:00.756]  It's like when I told Hatari of the hundreds of militia groups, I could tell they were being infiltrated because of their rhetoric.
[02:14:01.136 --> 02:14:02.237]  I got one of their members on.
[02:14:03.178 --> 02:14:25.750]  uh... back in august of last year and i said you're about to be set up i mean it's just so clear to see this date hate your mission of reaching out to the millions of vets and hundreds of thousands of active duty in police the millions of police because you're having such an effect showing them what's happening that of course they want to get you off mission of course they want to get you uh... to uh... to i mean i mean they were
[02:14:26.891 --> 02:14:37.305]  As you said, you've already got ATF and FBI trying to go and find stuff on your members already so they can create this false picture that you guys are this evil group.
[02:14:38.203 --> 02:14:38.443]  Right.
[02:14:38.663 --> 02:14:40.004]  Yeah, they know how to deal with militias.
[02:14:40.665 --> 02:14:46.749]  Unfortunately, the PR battle was lost back in the 90s for the Citizen Militias.
[02:14:47.190 --> 02:14:48.471]  And so they know how to smear them.
[02:14:48.491 --> 02:14:50.753]  They don't know how to deal with what we're doing.
[02:14:50.833 --> 02:14:53.855]  It makes it very difficult for them to attack us directly.
[02:14:54.155 --> 02:14:57.738]  And so they have to make us into something we're not to be easier to attack.
[02:14:59.633 --> 02:15:00.475]  They're certainly doing that.
[02:15:00.535 --> 02:15:03.684]  Shifting gears with your interview with Ross Story.
[02:15:03.744 --> 02:15:06.531]  Oathkeeper founder slams conservative media hypocrisy.
[02:15:06.772 --> 02:15:07.815]  Why is that so important?
[02:15:07.835 --> 02:15:08.396]  And break it down.
[02:15:09.585 --> 02:15:14.387]  Well, I mean, the left has, since Oath Keepers began, has had this fitting mantra.
[02:15:14.707 --> 02:15:18.668]  Like with the Mother Jones interview, she totally misquoted me.
[02:15:18.708 --> 02:15:23.710]  She says in the article that I said I trusted Bush to only grab the terrorists.
[02:15:23.790 --> 02:15:25.630]  I never trusted Bush to do anything.
[02:15:26.011 --> 02:15:28.471]  And so I think it was a willful misquote.
[02:15:28.932 --> 02:15:31.232]  And what it does is make me look like a political hack.
[02:15:31.772 --> 02:15:36.374]  It makes me look like I'm just another Republican that doesn't like the fact that they're out of power.
[02:15:37.498 --> 02:15:39.198]  But you've always been critical of Bush.
[02:15:39.258 --> 02:15:41.659]  I've been interviewing you for, what, almost three years now.
[02:15:42.019 --> 02:15:45.580]  I mean, this is, since the time you started, this is pure deception.
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:47.380]  You needed to demand a retraction.
[02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:48.960]  I did.
[02:15:48.980 --> 02:15:52.881]  I emailed her and she said she would fix it, and I haven't seen a retraction yet.
[02:15:53.541 --> 02:15:54.822]  But that's how they do it.
[02:15:55.142 --> 02:15:57.842]  It's once more the divide and conquer.
[02:15:58.182 --> 02:16:06.924]  They don't even want people on the political left to understand that there are people on the political right who are consistent and they have goodwill.
[02:16:07.404 --> 02:16:11.227]  I heard an interview with Debbie Wolf about two weeks ago.
[02:16:11.588 --> 02:16:12.829]  She's fairly consistent.
[02:16:12.889 --> 02:16:14.810]  She actually defended the Tea Parties.
[02:16:15.371 --> 02:16:17.372]  And she's saying, look, they do have some points.
[02:16:17.853 --> 02:16:20.535]  And all the powers that Bush put in place are still there.
[02:16:20.915 --> 02:16:25.519]  And so there are people of goodwill on both the so-called left and the so-called right.
[02:16:25.859 --> 02:16:28.101]  But they don't want each camp to know that.
[02:16:28.421 --> 02:16:34.106]  They want you all to divide and conquer and hate each other as though you were just opposing sports teams.
[02:16:36.048 --> 02:16:38.750]  And that's what the Republicans are doing right now.
[02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:46.296]  They've come in and tried to take over the Tea Parties so that Democrats and others don't join to have a true populist constitutional movement.
[02:16:48.166 --> 02:16:53.309]  They don't want it to be about GOP and to steer you back into voting for them.
[02:16:53.709 --> 02:16:57.251]  They don't want it to be a populist or an independent movement.
[02:16:57.292 --> 02:16:59.793]  Many Americans now are registering independent.
[02:16:59.873 --> 02:17:01.734]  I just heard the same thing happening in the military.
[02:17:02.014 --> 02:17:04.976]  In fact, I was talking to a guy from Army Times just yesterday.
[02:17:04.996 --> 02:17:06.317]  I'm doing an interview with them tomorrow.
[02:17:06.637 --> 02:17:12.621]  And he was saying that the new phenomenon in the military is that more and more of them are registering as independent.
[02:17:13.041 --> 02:17:16.243]  And that has got to be scaring the two-headed monster.
[02:17:18.590 --> 02:17:27.840]  And so they're going to try to stage a provocateur event to demonize us so the American people don't get together because they're gearing up for their total financial collapse.
[02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:38.010]  They think they're going to be able to win, but I'm seeing the confidence drain out of their eyes, drain out of their faces, and just bleed out of their spirit.
[02:17:38.090 --> 02:17:39.572]  They are losing the initiative.
[02:17:41.687 --> 02:17:44.292]  Of course, the big danger is like a corner rat.
[02:17:44.593 --> 02:17:46.256]  That's when they become more dangerous in some way.
[02:17:46.316 --> 02:17:47.618]  It's definitely going to be on our toes.
[02:17:47.979 --> 02:17:51.987]  But a good sign is like the... I got an article, an interview with...
[02:17:53.214 --> 02:17:54.295]  We're good to go.
[02:18:18.482 --> 02:18:25.446]  Yeah, I mean, actually, a lot of neocons are praising Obama for wars, torture, secret arrests, military tribunals.
[02:18:27.147 --> 02:18:32.791]  So I tell Democrats, I mean, if you like Obama, you should absolutely love Bush.
[02:18:33.971 --> 02:18:34.212]  Right.
[02:18:34.772 --> 02:18:37.394]  And it's no surprise that neocons don't like us at all either.
[02:18:37.754 --> 02:18:41.436]  I mean, if someone like John Yoo certainly is not going to be happy about Oath Keepers.
[02:18:41.476 --> 02:18:42.056]  Well, stay there.
[02:18:42.196 --> 02:18:42.677]  Stay there.
[02:18:42.737 --> 02:18:43.137]  Stay there.
[02:18:43.337 --> 02:18:43.857]  Gotta break.
[02:18:44.318 --> 02:18:45.799]  I'm Stuart Rhodes, OathKeepers.org.
[02:18:46.874 --> 02:18:49.876]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:18:50.817 --> 02:18:53.599]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:18:57.041 --> 02:18:59.342]  Max, what did you do with the remote?
[02:18:59.943 --> 02:19:00.943]  Now what am I gonna do?
[02:19:01.364 --> 02:19:03.125]  I guess I can go online to find a new one.
[02:19:03.525 --> 02:19:05.046]  Okay, here's a site.
[02:19:05.486 --> 02:19:07.108]  Replacementremotes.com.

[02:19:09.889 --> 02:19:12.151]  Well, I guess they can't repair this one.
[02:19:12.711 --> 02:19:13.472]  Thanks, Max.
[02:19:14.452 --> 02:19:16.674]  Wow, they have my original remote!
[02:19:17.359 --> 02:19:19.742]  And an exact replacement that doesn't need programming.

[02:20:41.534 --> 02:20:44.656]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:20:45.097 --> 02:20:46.478]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:20:47.039 --> 02:20:47.520]  It's here.

[02:20:56.829 --> 02:21:03.412]  It's no secret why pharmaceutical companies and mainstream media often question the safety and effectiveness of herbal supplements.
[02:21:03.832 --> 02:21:12.016]  But isn't it ironic that mainstream pharmaceutical companies are the ones who manufacture overpriced prescription drugs that produce dangerous side effects?

[02:22:05.011 --> 02:22:07.695]  We're going to take a few calls for Stuart Rhodes here in just a moment.
[02:22:07.735 --> 02:22:14.124]  He just told me they're going to put a big billboard out in front of Homeland Brigade headquarters, the domestic takeover troops.
[02:22:15.186 --> 02:22:20.334]  Before I go any further, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[02:22:21.852 --> 02:22:25.533]  You know, we turned down probably 70-80% of the sponsors that contact us.
[02:22:25.593 --> 02:22:27.093]  I only take sponsors I believe in.
[02:22:27.133 --> 02:22:29.133]  And believe me, I really believe in these sponsors.
[02:22:29.854 --> 02:22:31.754]  It's 100% made in America.
[02:22:32.554 --> 02:22:34.114]  They're based in Tennessee and Georgia.
[02:22:34.734 --> 02:22:36.135]  They're diamond gusset jeans.
[02:22:36.575 --> 02:22:39.335]  They got regular jeans, motorcycle jeans, you name it.
[02:22:39.395 --> 02:22:40.136]  They are awesome.
[02:22:40.236 --> 02:22:40.696]  I wear them.
[02:22:40.716 --> 02:22:41.556]  I got a couple pairs.
[02:22:41.576 --> 02:22:42.776]  I'm gonna get a few more.
[02:22:43.916 --> 02:22:46.937]  And they're just super high quality and they're made in America.
[02:22:47.717 --> 02:22:49.959]  You can call them at 888-8GUSSET.
[02:22:50.059 --> 02:22:52.281]  Gusset is G-U-S-S-E-T.
[02:22:52.301 --> 02:22:52.321]  888-8.
[02:22:53.261 --> 02:22:55.923]  So that's four eights and the word Gusset.
[02:22:55.963 --> 02:22:57.324]  G-U-S-S-E-T.
[02:22:58.245 --> 02:23:01.508]  Or go to gussetclothing.com.
[02:23:01.948 --> 02:23:04.009]  Made in America.
[02:23:04.890 --> 02:23:06.751]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:23:07.651 --> 02:23:10.212]  And they have got extra strong selling.
[02:23:10.232 --> 02:23:11.012]  They don't split open.
[02:23:11.072 --> 02:23:12.212]  I can't even buy Levi's anymore.
[02:23:12.232 --> 02:23:13.113]  They're just total crud.
[02:23:13.133 --> 02:23:14.913]  They're now made outside the U.S.
[02:23:15.313 --> 02:23:17.074]  And they just keep splitting open on me.
[02:23:17.434 --> 02:23:19.915]  Even if I get baggy pairs, they're total crud.
[02:23:20.255 --> 02:23:21.015]  Not Gusset.
[02:23:21.335 --> 02:23:22.276]  Not Diamond Gusset.
[02:23:22.316 --> 02:23:24.016]  GussetClothing.com.
[02:23:24.536 --> 02:23:28.958]  And one other sponsor I want to tell you about is SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:23:30.967 --> 02:23:33.831]  Look, everybody needs storable food, but on top of it, you need seeds.
[02:23:33.891 --> 02:23:34.972]  And plus, your kids will love it.
[02:23:35.012 --> 02:23:36.554]  They're non-GMO, non-hybrid.
[02:23:37.275 --> 02:23:37.936]  The U.N.
[02:23:37.996 --> 02:23:43.464]  and other groups are buying up the main seed lines so you can't get seeds that produce plants that then produce seeds.
[02:23:44.545 --> 02:23:45.787]  The GMO is so bad.
[02:23:45.847 --> 02:23:47.008]  Buy a survival seed bank.
[02:23:47.509 --> 02:23:47.869]  Plan it.
[02:23:47.969 --> 02:23:48.650]  It's springtime.
[02:23:48.690 --> 02:23:49.450]  Plan it in the summer.
[02:23:49.550 --> 02:23:50.371]  Plan it in the fall.
[02:23:50.711 --> 02:23:52.532]  And then get another one and put it away.
[02:23:52.652 --> 02:23:55.875]  We need to get back to the land and become self-sufficient.
[02:23:56.175 --> 02:24:02.019]  SurvivalSeedBank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:24:02.319 --> 02:24:04.420]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:24:04.460 --> 02:24:06.141]  SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:24:06.181 --> 02:24:06.782]  Great sponsor.
[02:24:07.182 --> 02:24:07.422]  Okay.
[02:24:07.743 --> 02:24:12.226]  Going back, and we're going to get a few calls in here, with Stuart Rhodes, who's on a short vacation.
[02:24:12.246 --> 02:24:13.586]  We appreciate him taking time out with us.
[02:24:14.027 --> 02:24:16.168]  He's joining us via cell phone from a camp out.
[02:24:17.970 --> 02:24:19.312]  Well, that sounds extreme, doesn't it?
[02:24:19.472 --> 02:24:20.233]  Evil campers.
[02:24:20.253 --> 02:24:21.095]  We've got to watch them.
[02:24:21.896 --> 02:24:25.722]  You were going to make a point about reaching out more to the military, staying on mission.
[02:24:25.742 --> 02:24:30.369]  You were telling me how they're trying to infiltrate you guys off air, how they're trying to set you up, but it's not going to work.
[02:24:30.730 --> 02:24:31.571]  Staying on mission.
[02:24:31.591 --> 02:24:32.473]  Tell us about the billboard.
[02:24:33.558 --> 02:24:41.422]  Well, we want to focus in right on the Combat Brigade at Fort Stewart, Georgia, which has been the one attached to the North Comp for the 3rd Infantry Division.
[02:24:41.862 --> 02:24:48.346]  And so we're going to put a billboard up in front of their headquarters, in front of their base, that this is honor your oath, or remember your oath.
[02:24:48.806 --> 02:24:49.367]  We're good to go.
[02:25:10.202 --> 02:25:35.572]  And that billboard will get media attention, it'll get all the troops talking about it, it'll get a dialogue with the officers talking about it, and all of you as listeners who have friends, family, neighbors who are in the armed services or who are police officers, you are in a key position to reach out to them and educate them with films like Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA that documents and proves just how evil this globalist takeover is and how they plan to use the police and military to carry this out.
[02:25:35.612 --> 02:25:36.893]  Before we go to calls, one other point.
[02:25:37.930 --> 02:25:49.477]  We need a public, above-board group that's mainstream and just calls for the Bill of Rights and Constitution and defense of the Republic against gun confiscation to just educate the military.
[02:25:49.858 --> 02:25:50.958]  And the feds hate that.
[02:25:50.998 --> 02:25:54.100]  That's why they're trying to infiltrate you, trying to radicalize you.
[02:25:54.841 --> 02:25:57.883]  If people want to be secretive and individual, that's good.
[02:25:58.583 --> 02:26:05.508]  But we also need a public arm to reach out and educate people, and that's just the way
[02:26:06.468 --> 02:26:10.749]  We're disciplined enough that they have to go and stuff up about us.
[02:26:10.789 --> 02:26:12.770]  Because we're not making it easy for them to attack us.
[02:26:26.715 --> 02:26:29.077]  We possibly can, but I make mistakes once in a while.
[02:26:29.457 --> 02:26:34.300]  But I do my best to get back on mission and focus on the current survey.
[02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:37.522]  And if they do what's right, then we will win.
[02:26:38.102 --> 02:26:40.544]  So they can't do it without me.
[02:26:40.584 --> 02:26:45.667]  Well, they don't want it to be mainstream to be constitutional and Bill of Rights and Mom and Apple Pie.
[02:26:45.847 --> 02:26:51.091]  They want to make it dirty and secretive so they can tell the public, oh look, this is secretive.
[02:26:52.688 --> 02:26:54.909]  That's why they attacked Judge Napolitano.
[02:26:55.229 --> 02:27:08.897]  Here's a guy, as straight-laced as you can get, a judge, well-respected judge, for years he's criticized Bush, he's criticized Obama, he's a pure constitutionalist, and yet he's on the hit list for Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:27:08.957 --> 02:27:09.537]  It's absurd!
[02:27:10.738 --> 02:27:12.279]  Yeah, they're really discrediting themselves.
[02:27:12.819 --> 02:27:14.200]  Let's talk to Bev in Canada.
[02:27:14.220 --> 02:27:15.320]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:27:15.340 --> 02:27:18.022]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:27:19.182 --> 02:27:20.443]  We love you up here in Canada.
[02:27:21.266 --> 02:27:24.990]  I'm Canadian, my father's American, who served two tours in Vietnam.
[02:27:25.831 --> 02:27:34.361]  I'm wondering, why can we not, you know, we can't force these people to the billboard, but we can reach out with recordings from Oath Keepers.
[02:27:35.062 --> 02:27:40.929]  Why can Oath Keepers not record for us a good copy recording for playing for officers and soldiers?
[02:27:41.707 --> 02:27:46.928]  Uh, saying their oath so that we can continuously play this during peaceful protests at the G8, the FTC.
[02:27:47.008 --> 02:27:59.811]  Well, ma'am, ma'am, the extra on Fall of the Republic is the Oath Keepers giving the oath and explaining it in, what, a little 15 minute video.
[02:28:00.471 --> 02:28:04.952]  And they do have videos that I've seen where they're reciting the oath in the code.
[02:28:04.992 --> 02:28:05.792]  Don't you, Stewart?
[02:28:06.852 --> 02:28:08.893]  We do have some, but she's definitely right.
[02:28:08.973 --> 02:28:14.194]  It's a very powerful medium, and we want to get more video testimonials.
[02:28:14.894 --> 02:28:17.515]  So I do encourage people to, you know, throw it up on YouTube.
[02:28:17.595 --> 02:28:17.995]  Make one.
[02:28:18.575 --> 02:28:19.575]  Well, listen, listen.
[02:28:19.755 --> 02:28:20.896]  I mean, I can do it tomorrow.
[02:28:20.996 --> 02:28:27.017]  I can, you know, read in a broadcaster voice the Declaration of Orders we will not obey.
[02:28:27.037 --> 02:28:33.059]  I can read that and then put, say, you know, drumbeat music to it.
[02:28:33.099 --> 02:28:33.299]  I mean,
[02:28:34.199 --> 02:28:35.500]  Again, this is a team effort.
[02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:36.600]  This is not top-down.
[02:28:36.660 --> 02:28:37.160]  Right, Stuart?
[02:28:37.701 --> 02:28:38.401]  Absolutely not.
[02:28:38.481 --> 02:28:48.546]  And we would really want those... I think she's talking about veterans and current serving talking about their oath and pledging themselves and reaffirming their oath.
[02:28:48.626 --> 02:28:49.947]  What exactly are you saying, ma'am?
[02:28:49.967 --> 02:28:58.431]  I need to remind the officers on the line that are bashing their shields towards us what their oaths really are pertaining to.
[02:28:59.231 --> 02:29:01.652]  It's not for these corporations or the government.
[02:29:01.752 --> 02:29:03.213]  It's pertaining to we, the people.
[02:29:03.726 --> 02:29:05.367]  Regardless of if we're in the U.S.
[02:29:05.567 --> 02:29:06.567]  or if we're in Canada.
[02:29:06.887 --> 02:29:09.268]  No, I know, but specifically what are you calling for?
[02:29:09.348 --> 02:29:13.810]  I mean, are you saying a recording that can be played at events of the oath?
[02:29:13.850 --> 02:29:14.430]  What are you saying?
[02:29:14.950 --> 02:29:16.851]  Yeah, well, they're hitting us with sound waves.
[02:29:17.338 --> 02:29:23.681]  Why don't we retaliate with hitting them with what our rights are, what they made an oath towards us.
[02:29:23.961 --> 02:29:28.303]  Well, Luke Radowsky did do that in Pittsburgh and he got arrested and so did Rob Dood for no reason.
[02:29:28.663 --> 02:29:37.047]  And those police, when they were going into even the university and attacking peaceful groups of people and attacking old ladies with police dogs, you've seen that footage, Stuart.
[02:29:37.067 --> 02:29:41.529]  Do you think that was a violation of the military and police oath, what you saw in Pittsburgh?
[02:29:42.552 --> 02:29:43.372]  Absolutely.
[02:29:43.492 --> 02:29:44.613]  Luke did a great job.
[02:29:44.633 --> 02:29:49.995]  He's one of our forum users and he did a great job of trying to do that.
[02:29:50.356 --> 02:29:51.876]  It's tough to do that on the spot.
[02:29:52.176 --> 02:29:58.719]  I'm not saying you shouldn't do it, but our goal is to reach them before they're suited up and before they're put in that mindset.
[02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:01.421]  We want to reach them before they're out there on the line.
[02:30:01.681 --> 02:30:03.882]  But everyone's got to do their fight their own way.
[02:30:03.962 --> 02:30:08.884]  So she's more than welcome to get that tactic a try and Luke did his best.
[02:30:09.404 --> 02:30:10.625]  So I'm not mocking it.
[02:30:11.067 --> 02:30:11.587]  Absolutely.
[02:30:11.627 --> 02:30:15.648]  He just peacefully, with a bullhorn, as they were beating people, said, please follow your oath.
[02:30:15.708 --> 02:30:19.489]  And so they arrested him and then tortured him at a military facility.
[02:30:19.769 --> 02:30:23.250]  They took him to an old prison run by the military and beat him up and tortured him.
[02:30:23.770 --> 02:30:26.771]  Let's go ahead and talk to a general in California.
[02:30:26.791 --> 02:30:27.311]  You're on the air.
[02:30:27.351 --> 02:30:27.731]  Go ahead.
[02:30:27.751 --> 02:30:33.393]  Okay, he just dropped off.
[02:30:33.493 --> 02:30:34.433]  Cliff in Kansas.
[02:30:34.453 --> 02:30:36.654]  You're on the air with Stuart Rhodes of OathKeepers.org.
[02:30:36.694 --> 02:30:37.274]  Go ahead, Cliff.
[02:30:38.559 --> 02:30:40.300]  I just want to make a couple statements, basically.
[02:30:40.980 --> 02:30:42.661]  I do appreciate you guys and what you're doing.
[02:30:42.761 --> 02:30:54.347]  I think a lot of what is happening too, you know, I live here in little old Kansas and we're starting to see a lot more of the police state stuff going on and then, of course, trying to educate people on that.
[02:30:54.427 --> 02:31:00.670]  I really appreciate you guys giving us your hard work and stuff and we take your stuff and give it out to people.
[02:31:00.690 --> 02:31:07.514]  It kind of blows my mind how people, I mean, even people that are supposed to be Christians and in the military and stuff like that,
[02:31:08.503 --> 02:31:12.105]  They've really worked hard at brainwashing these people, you know?
[02:31:12.145 --> 02:31:21.290]  I mean, you think you're overcoming years of propaganda machine working hard on these people, and in my family, they're kind of starting to really open up a lot of this stuff.
[02:31:21.330 --> 02:31:24.572]  Well, it takes time, and listen to this, Cliff.
[02:31:25.953 --> 02:31:30.556]  Again, you plant the seeds, and then when they see the tyranny later, they will sprout.
[02:31:30.856 --> 02:31:33.918]  Don't expect an immediate response.
[02:31:36.434 --> 02:31:41.528]  In fact, and I appreciate your call, Cliff, going back to Stuart Rhodes, your comment on that, Stuart?
[02:31:42.631 --> 02:31:43.091]  Absolutely.
[02:31:43.111 --> 02:31:44.012]  I mean, he's right.
[02:31:44.032 --> 02:31:49.056]  It's been a long time conditioning, and it is definitely difficult to counter it.
[02:31:49.476 --> 02:31:50.777]  But you've got to do something.
[02:31:50.937 --> 02:31:52.178]  And it is making an effect.
[02:31:52.538 --> 02:31:55.660]  I mean, I know it's making an effect, otherwise you wouldn't be attacking me.
[02:31:56.061 --> 02:31:57.822]  And so you're having an effect.
[02:31:57.922 --> 02:32:00.764]  All of us working together, we are having an effect.
[02:32:01.044 --> 02:32:02.966]  And given enough time, we will win.
[02:32:03.306 --> 02:32:04.006]  And they know that.
[02:32:04.066 --> 02:32:04.947]  That's why they're worried.
[02:32:05.267 --> 02:32:09.090]  That's why they're pulling out every dirty trick they possibly can to shut us down.
[02:32:09.350 --> 02:32:10.451]  But I don't think it's going to succeed.
[02:32:10.930 --> 02:32:13.011]  Well, they're like chickens with their heads cut off.
[02:32:13.071 --> 02:32:16.493]  I mean, I don't even watch much TV, but I'll be at my parents' house or my grandma's.
[02:32:16.513 --> 02:32:17.354]  They got the TV on.
[02:32:17.674 --> 02:32:20.135]  I randomly turned the TV on this weekend.
[02:32:20.495 --> 02:32:25.798]  All they talk about is demonizing Americans that want freedom, demonizing Americans that want liberty.
[02:32:25.838 --> 02:32:31.642]  I've talked to so many military people and police in these briefings when they specifically demonize me by name.
[02:32:32.403 --> 02:32:36.489]  And, you know, say I'm the worst and the most dangerous and that I want them dead and I hate them.
[02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:39.895]  Well, the military and police then go and actually hear what I have to say.
[02:32:40.215 --> 02:32:42.960]  So I also see their demonization backfiring, Stuart.
[02:32:43.851 --> 02:32:45.092]  Absolutely it is.
[02:32:45.492 --> 02:32:50.796]  They're now demonizing basically at least half the country, if not three quarters of the country.
[02:32:51.157 --> 02:32:53.659]  And anyone who believes in America, they're demonizing.
[02:32:54.059 --> 02:32:55.500]  And they're jumping the shark.
[02:32:55.520 --> 02:32:58.122]  They're just going so far that it's becoming absurd.
[02:32:58.322 --> 02:33:03.126]  Well, they're really showing us that the people running the government really are the bad guys.
[02:33:03.486 --> 02:33:12.453]  I mean, here they are saying that the traditional good guys are bad, and I really think it's... But they've got so much arrogance, so much hubris,
[02:33:13.955 --> 02:33:17.638]  But, as I said, now hubris is giving way to desperation.
[02:33:19.259 --> 02:33:20.340]  Final question, Stuart.
[02:33:20.600 --> 02:33:23.123]  How do you think the cornered rat is going to strike back?
[02:33:23.143 --> 02:33:25.885]  Well, I'm only worried about economic collapse.
[02:33:26.045 --> 02:33:28.127]  I think Dr. Edmund Pierres was correct.
[02:33:28.147 --> 02:33:32.111]  He wrote last month, I believe, where he said that that's our greatest weakness.
[02:33:32.231 --> 02:33:39.137]  We don't have sound money, and we don't have a militia in our states to fill the vacuum or assist the police.
[02:33:39.617 --> 02:33:40.077]  We're good to go.
[02:34:07.708 --> 02:34:10.129]  Yeah, notice the conditioning's really intensifying.
[02:34:10.149 --> 02:34:11.510]  The government's your mommy.
[02:34:12.090 --> 02:34:13.151]  It's going to protect you.
[02:34:13.211 --> 02:34:15.172]  And FEMA for years says, get ready.
[02:34:15.592 --> 02:34:16.813]  Bad things are coming.
[02:34:17.173 --> 02:34:18.014]  Be prepared.
[02:34:18.274 --> 02:34:20.775]  So that when it happens, they say, see, we told you.
[02:34:21.536 --> 02:34:22.156]  It's incredible.
[02:34:22.196 --> 02:34:25.078]  Stuart Rhodes, we appreciate your courage and the great effect.
[02:34:25.718 --> 02:34:45.732]  That you're happening with OathKeepers.org and we appreciate you going through the storm and we're all here right beside you together and as you said all of us working towards liberty and freedom and to warn people and to put out an alternative to tyranny to tell people the other side of the story the rest of the story as Paul Harvey would say
[02:34:46.592 --> 02:34:48.354]  In the end, we're going to win.
[02:34:48.654 --> 02:34:55.240]  History shows that a man in the wrong can't stand up against a man on the right who keeps on a-coming.
[02:34:55.540 --> 02:35:08.531]  We have to keep on a-coming, and whatever happens to you individually, or me individually, or Ron Paul, or Judge Napolitano, or anybody else, regardless, in the end, the message of freedom and liberty is bulletproof.
[02:35:09.352 --> 02:35:12.174]  It is transcendent, and again, I salute you.
[02:35:12.194 --> 02:35:13.095]  Go with God, my friend.
[02:35:13.155 --> 02:35:13.716]  Vaya con Dios.
[02:35:16.069 --> 02:35:16.909]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:35:16.929 --> 02:35:27.755]  Okay, you know, I'll have to do this tomorrow, because I said that I was going to get into race-based politics, and there's so many facets to this.
[02:35:30.357 --> 02:35:37.661]  This morning I happened to just run across some La Raza and Mecha videos saying we're going to take over the U.S.
[02:35:37.761 --> 02:35:41.583]  and all Hispanics are for basically killing the whitey, which isn't true.
[02:35:43.007 --> 02:35:45.189]  It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:35:45.229 --> 02:35:47.751]  But white people hear this, then they get radicalized.
[02:35:48.332 --> 02:35:52.295]  Hispanics then go, well, I guess this is the way it's going, I better, you know, choose a side.
[02:35:52.655 --> 02:35:55.237]  The media says, you know, all Hispanics want open borders.
[02:35:55.277 --> 02:35:59.681]  When polls show upwards of 80% of American Hispanics, they're not stupid, they're smart.
[02:35:59.801 --> 02:36:01.403]  They know it's killing their jobs, their future.
[02:36:01.763 --> 02:36:03.765]  They know there's 600 million people in Latin America.
[02:36:04.085 --> 02:36:05.106]  They can't all come here.
[02:36:05.846 --> 02:36:06.807]  They've got common sense.
[02:36:08.112 --> 02:36:10.093]  And so they're invoking this, invoking this.
[02:36:10.114 --> 02:36:20.561]  But then I ran across a video clip I'd seen years ago, and I've seen a lot of this talk, by Kama Kambon's most excellent speech.
[02:36:20.581 --> 02:36:22.903]  It is the name of the YouTube video from C-SPAN.
[02:36:22.923 --> 02:36:24.784]  Am I pronouncing that right?
[02:36:26.725 --> 02:36:28.247]  Kama or Kama?
[02:36:29.748 --> 02:36:30.188]  How do you say it?
[02:36:32.790 --> 02:36:33.670]  Kamu Kabon.
[02:36:34.867 --> 02:37:02.287]  And this guy was a big professor, and I don't have time now to play the whole ten-minute video of his short speech, because we're out of time, but you can go to YouTube and watch Camus Cabone's most excellent speech, or just Google black professor calls for extermination of white race, because I just ran into this in amongst all the Mecha government-funded La Raza stuff, not because they ever intend to have
[02:37:03.067 --> 02:37:04.968]  Some mecha group actually take over the U.S.
[02:37:04.989 --> 02:37:15.096]  They want us all having a war with each other, and the feds play the part of the referee, of the arbiter, of the group that comes in and saves us from ourselves.
[02:37:15.136 --> 02:37:20.340]  But I ran into this video, and everything he says in the first part of the video is true.
[02:37:21.020 --> 02:37:24.142]  The government's poisoning your food, your water, your vaccines.
[02:37:24.563 --> 02:37:26.464]  They're shipping drugs into the country.
[02:37:27.545 --> 02:37:29.747]  The banking system is meant to make you a slave.
[02:37:30.646 --> 02:37:43.355]  But then he says, white people are the ones that invented this and run this, and white people are a cancer, and all white people must be killed.
[02:37:44.415 --> 02:37:50.299]  And you remember Khalid Mohammed, the Black Panther leader, who would say, we kill the men, we kill the women, we kill the babies.
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:51.840]  Oh, we kill the little babies.
[02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:54.202]  You bet we do, because they're going to grow up to be, you know, devils.
[02:37:54.262 --> 02:37:57.624]  And we kill the white women because of the Military Manufacturing Center.
[02:37:57.644 --> 02:37:58.425]  I mean, you've all heard it.
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:12.370]  But here he is in this group of black academics and they're nodding their head and agreeing and getting tears in their eyes with this exaltation to kill Whitey.
[02:38:13.251 --> 02:38:15.553]  And then I come out and I say, I'm against that.
[02:38:15.593 --> 02:38:17.695]  Well then see, I'm the blue-eyed devil.
[02:38:19.456 --> 02:38:21.498]  This is asinine, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:23.117 --> 02:38:26.721]  But the point is, the media comes out and says, this is all condonable.
[02:38:26.901 --> 02:38:27.962]  This is all okay.
[02:38:28.403 --> 02:38:29.024]  This is good.
[02:38:29.044 --> 02:38:36.632]  You know, when the illegals set fire to restaurants and attack people with torches last weekend, it's only in a few California TV stations.
[02:38:36.652 --> 02:38:39.815]  And the TV stations interview people that say, well, they have a reason to be mad.
[02:38:39.875 --> 02:38:40.476]  I think it's good.
[02:38:41.377 --> 02:38:53.043]  But again, then they lie about Oath Keepers and all these other groups that are totally inclusive and want everyone to join and to be part of the fight for freedom and property rights and what produces so much wealth.
[02:38:54.204 --> 02:38:55.865]  And we're called racist.
[02:38:55.925 --> 02:39:01.968]  I mean, again, the people posing as the anti-racist, they are the racist.
[02:39:01.988 --> 02:39:04.810]  And I'm not even talking about this black professor saying, kill everyone on the planet.
[02:39:06.611 --> 02:39:09.052]  But see, it's true that AIDS was created.
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:12.761]  to kill third-world populations.
[02:39:12.981 --> 02:39:13.761]  It's true.
[02:39:13.781 --> 02:39:14.801]  I mean, we have the documents.
[02:39:14.901 --> 02:39:16.461]  It's true they're spiking the water.
[02:39:16.821 --> 02:39:17.502]  But here's the deal.
[02:39:17.902 --> 02:39:19.402]  They're spiking everybody's water.
[02:39:20.162 --> 02:39:27.084]  All the GM food that they produce that's sterilizing people on record in every major study, it was meant for everybody.
[02:39:27.384 --> 02:39:35.306]  You think a white cop or do you think a white judge or do you think a white talk show host gets a memo saying, hey, don't drink the water, pal, you're white?
[02:39:35.806 --> 02:39:35.986]  No!
[02:39:37.170 --> 02:39:42.534]  No, I mean, there's little white kids all over Austin dying from vaccines they've been given filled with cancer viruses.
[02:39:43.174 --> 02:39:50.519]  And so, well, again, to even get into this, I needed a full hour to cover this, and I'm just going to come back and play a short clip.
[02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:54.582]  But tomorrow, I'm going to spend time on this.
[02:39:54.602 --> 02:39:55.303]  It's so important.
[02:39:57.338 --> 02:39:58.699]  Don't answer it!
[02:39:59.199 --> 02:40:07.305]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[02:40:15.131 --> 02:40:19.192]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[02:40:56.360 --> 02:40:58.661]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:40:58.681 --> 02:41:00.962]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:41:01.062 --> 02:41:03.884]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:41:04.284 --> 02:41:09.027]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:41:09.387 --> 02:41:13.569]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:41:13.889 --> 02:41:16.233]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:41:16.353 --> 02:41:18.757]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:41:18.777 --> 02:41:21.681]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:41:22.041 --> 02:41:29.653]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:41:29.973 --> 02:41:35.238]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:41:35.358 --> 02:41:37.641]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:41:37.681 --> 02:41:41.665]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:41:41.905 --> 02:41:42.806]  And I got news for you.
[02:41:42.986 --> 02:41:44.287]  You're everyone else.
[02:41:44.327 --> 02:41:45.328]  Invisible Empire.

[02:42:02.954 --> 02:42:06.418]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:42:06.679 --> 02:42:08.240]  Add less than 2 cents per gallon.
[02:42:08.561 --> 02:42:13.146]  Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine
[02:42:15.287 --> 02:42:15.727]  I think so.

[02:42:48.687 --> 02:42:51.428]  Alright, the Feds are saying the Pakistani American is admitting what he did.
[02:43:05.916 --> 02:43:08.718]  That's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:43:09.038 --> 02:43:12.301]  Will Mayor Bloomberg come out and apologize for saying the tea parties did it?
[02:43:13.302 --> 02:43:13.962]  With no evidence?
[02:43:13.982 --> 02:43:15.483]  Because a white guy walked by the car?
[02:43:16.664 --> 02:43:18.546]  But look, I'll talk more about this tomorrow.
[02:43:19.987 --> 02:43:23.409]  I've studied anthropology, I've studied archaeology, I've studied just basic history.
[02:43:24.030 --> 02:43:33.237]  The Japanese ruling class enslaved their underclass and had laws in place where samurai could kill anybody they wanted, anytime they wanted, for no reason.
[02:43:34.025 --> 02:43:34.986]  And the people were slaves.
[02:43:35.626 --> 02:43:37.948]  The Chinese ruling class enslaved Chinese.
[02:43:38.048 --> 02:43:40.129]  Black tribes always enslaved their neighbors.
[02:43:40.830 --> 02:43:42.611]  Arab groups always enslaved their neighbors.
[02:43:43.752 --> 02:43:49.256]  Most of the slaves in the Roman Empire were white, from what's France and Germany today, Gaul and Germania.
[02:43:52.198 --> 02:43:53.779]  This is how it works, okay?
[02:43:53.879 --> 02:43:56.681]  Groups come in and they enslave other groups.
[02:43:57.001 --> 02:43:57.922]  But that's not taught.
[02:43:57.942 --> 02:44:01.484]  You know, we're taught, oh, the Founding Fathers are back and some of them owned slaves.
[02:44:01.845 --> 02:44:03.266]  Yeah, and most of them spoke out against it.
[02:44:04.105 --> 02:44:05.745]  And it was being phased out at the time.
[02:44:06.706 --> 02:44:07.486]  That doesn't matter.
[02:44:07.946 --> 02:44:09.506]  That was the history they were in.
[02:44:09.526 --> 02:44:15.147]  That's like saying Mexico owns Texas to California and all states in between up to Colorado.
[02:44:15.847 --> 02:44:18.508]  Mexico had a few forts here, couldn't hold any of it.
[02:44:19.248 --> 02:44:22.329]  Mexico was more racist towards the native groups and still are today.
[02:44:22.909 --> 02:44:24.929]  They have the same extermination programs.
[02:44:24.989 --> 02:44:26.570]  I'm not saying that's good, it's bad.
[02:44:26.850 --> 02:44:28.150]  It's bad that both groups did it.
[02:44:29.210 --> 02:44:33.471]  But it's that we had a free market system here to some extent that created all this wealth.
[02:44:34.414 --> 02:44:41.424]  Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and play this black professor who talks about how white people are running this.
[02:44:41.504 --> 02:44:44.928]  No, evil people are running this.
[02:44:46.189 --> 02:44:48.872]  Every government on earth tries similar things.
[02:44:49.492 --> 02:44:59.501]  It's that Europe had the Renaissance, had more freedom than any other culture, and so it produced the most wealth, then evil people took over and had that wealthy system, and were able to dominate with it.
[02:45:00.142 --> 02:45:00.702]  That's why.
[02:45:01.203 --> 02:45:05.226]  Freedom created a war chest for evil to fund its operations.
[02:45:06.047 --> 02:45:07.007]  That's what's going on.
[02:45:07.628 --> 02:45:10.209]  And why doesn't this guy tell black people not to abort their kids?
[02:45:10.229 --> 02:45:11.509]  50 plus percent killing.
[02:45:12.390 --> 02:45:16.091]  Let's go out of the show with this disgusting clip saying exterminate white people.
[02:45:16.151 --> 02:45:22.894]  And this is mainline, I would say in about 5, 6, 7 percent of the black population in this country.
[02:45:23.155 --> 02:45:24.355]  This is very popular.
[02:45:25.596 --> 02:45:27.296]  They say it all over the message boards on my websites.
[02:45:27.316 --> 02:45:29.537]  They say, kill whites and we'll be safe.
[02:45:30.078 --> 02:45:30.638]  Yeah, right.
[02:45:30.678 --> 02:45:33.059]  You go to Africa and see how those tribes treat you.
[02:45:33.259 --> 02:45:35.100]  They don't know you, you'll be their slave tomorrow.
[02:45:35.861 --> 02:45:36.342]  Here it is.
[02:45:37.765 --> 02:45:41.934]  Now, what we have to do is we have to
[02:45:43.854 --> 02:45:47.297]  Divide a system or a plan for ourselves.
[02:45:47.357 --> 02:45:50.139]  And I said earlier that each one of you is a system.
[02:45:50.839 --> 02:46:05.171]  And everything that you do, every thought that you think, either you are supporting white world terror domination by your actions, what you buy, what you wear, where you go, what you eat, how you use your time.
[02:46:05.711 --> 02:46:12.036]  You are either supporting the white people in their process of death or you're for African liberation.
[02:46:12.116 --> 02:46:12.937]  It's one or the other.
[02:46:14.212 --> 02:46:22.954]  And if we don't use our time wisely, then we are engaging in a form of subtle suicide.
[02:46:23.235 --> 02:46:26.055]  Because as I said earlier, their system is still going on.
[02:46:26.375 --> 02:46:28.736]  They still have these images on TV that are going on.
[02:46:28.996 --> 02:46:32.697]  They're still warehousing our children into special ed, giving them Ritalin.
[02:46:33.477 --> 02:46:34.658]  There are no jobs.
[02:46:34.718 --> 02:46:35.838]  We fill in the hospitals.
[02:46:36.098 --> 02:46:37.739]  So their system is not stopping.
[02:46:39.259 --> 02:46:42.760]  And then finally, I want to say that we need one idea.
[02:46:44.571 --> 02:46:47.657]  And we're not thinking about a solution to the problem.
[02:46:48.278 --> 02:46:53.748]  We're dealing with all these other things, but these are diversions from the solution to the problem.
[02:46:54.642 --> 02:47:08.678]  And we have to start to think about a solution to the problem so that these young brothers and sisters who are here now, who are 15, 16, and 17, are not here 25 years later talking about these same problems.
[02:47:09.619 --> 02:47:14.885]  Now how do I know that the white people know that we are going to come up with a solution to the problem?
[02:47:16.169 --> 02:47:23.794]  I know it because they have retina scans, they have what they call racial profiling, DNA bans... Alright, folks, we ran out of time.
[02:47:24.015 --> 02:47:26.176]  I'm gonna have the... I'll play it tomorrow.
[02:47:26.436 --> 02:47:29.498]  He says exterminate all white people and it's been on the news, you know about it.
[02:47:30.419 --> 02:47:32.480]  But the globalists are doing it to everybody.
[02:47:32.901 --> 02:47:34.362]  See, he's divided and conquered.

[02:47:46.874 --> 02:47:49.477]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:47:49.877 --> 02:47:54.842]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:47:55.222 --> 02:47:56.944]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:47:57.265 --> 02:48:02.069]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:48:02.270 --> 02:48:03.231]  How much do you want?
[02:48:03.451 --> 02:48:04.192]  When do you want it?
[02:48:04.572 --> 02:48:06.174]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:48:06.454 --> 02:48:07.275]  When will you need it?
[02:48:07.535 --> 02:48:09.597]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:48:09.737 --> 02:48:10.518]  Will there be any food?
