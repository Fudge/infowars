[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.850]  We've got the governor of New Mexico on Friday.
[00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.310]  This is the biggest story out there.
[00:00:05.051 --> 00:00:06.251]  We have our whole press conference.
[00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:09.532]  We're going to be covering it coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:00:10.812 --> 00:00:15.454]  And she said, I don't care about your Second Amendment or your First Amendment.
[00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:16.734]  They're not absolute.
[00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:28.238]  I'm declaring an emergency because of spikes in crime in one city in their state by criminals where they've defunded the police.
[00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:39.482]  So you see how the operation works, all part of undermining the society.
[00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:52.192]  And then as it collapses with open borders and defunded police and criminals being let out of jail for super violent crimes in just a couple days in many cases, that encourages them to go crazy.
[00:00:53.353 --> 00:01:04.751]   And the same left doing it all, enabling it all, comes out and says, well, We're going to have to declare a health emergency and take your guns.
[00:01:06.012 --> 00:01:13.012]   rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty is Alex Jones.
[00:01:13.012 --> 00:01:34.012]   It would take hours to go over all the evidence which proves that the attack on September
[00:01:34.012 --> 00:01:37.512]  November 11th, 2001 was an inside job.
[00:01:37.432 --> 00:01:40.034]  And I suggest you look into it if you haven't already.
[00:01:40.574 --> 00:01:44.738]  But to simplify the situation, all you need to do is look at Building 7.
[00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:51.284]  What some people still don't realize is that there were three buildings that fell into their own footprint that day.
[00:01:51.704 --> 00:01:59.529]  Three buildings that fell at free-fall speed, indistinguishable from controlled demolitions, because that's exactly what they were.
[00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:04.893]  As the towers came crashing down, we can see the signatures of a controlled demolition.
[00:02:05.873 --> 00:02:20.903]  The official story is that Building 7, known as 7 World Trade Center, caught fire as a result of debris from the twin towers, which somehow caused a critical internal column to break, causing a cascading failure and collapse.
[00:02:21.423 --> 00:02:29.389]  And if this nonsensical official narrative were true, it would make it the first and only steel skyscraper in the world to collapse from fires.
[00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:39.096]  The building's owner, Larry Silverstein, took control of the Twin Towers just weeks before 9-11 and had them insured to cover terrorist attacks.
[00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:48.122]  After Building 7 collapsed, Silverstein told the media that the decision was made to pull it, suggesting that the building was collapsed on purpose.
[00:02:48.442 --> 00:02:54.565]  I remember getting a call from the fired-upon commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[00:02:54.585 --> 00:02:58.207]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[00:02:58.227 --> 00:03:02.489]  I guess one of the things to do is pull it.
[00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.732]  And they made that decision to pull, and then we watched the building collapse.
[00:03:07.497 --> 00:03:14.617]   This implies that they somehow rigged the explosives that afternoon while the building was still burning, which is
[00:03:14.617 --> 00:03:15.296]  ridiculous.
[00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:19.436]   And so the media dismissed his comments and changed their story.
[00:03:19.436 --> 00:03:26.507]   There were several witnesses who reported hearing and feeling the type of explosions one would expect from a
[00:03:26.507 --> 00:03:27.777]  controlled demolition.
[00:03:27.777 --> 00:03:29.777]  You heard explosions.
[00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:31.777]  Like, BOOM!
[00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:32.617]  Ooh.
[00:03:33.104 --> 00:03:34.464]  It's like a distinct sound.
[00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:35.325]  Big explosion.
[00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:37.025]  Blew us back into the 8th floor.
[00:03:37.386 --> 00:03:41.587]  Somebody grabbed my shoulder and I started running and the shit's hitting the ground behind me.
[00:03:43.068 --> 00:03:46.309]  And the whole time you're hearing thum-thum-thum-thum-thum.
[00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.252]  So... I think I know an explosion when I hear it.
[00:03:53.012 --> 00:03:55.533]  Do you know if it was an explosion or if it was a building collapse?
[00:03:56.734 --> 00:03:58.855]  To me it sounded like... To me it sounded like...
[00:03:59.887 --> 00:04:00.588]  An explosion.
[00:04:00.608 --> 00:04:03.150]  The explosions were captured on video.
[00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.670]  You want to call your mother or something?
[00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.150]  [EXPLOSION]
[00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.870]   In fact, we just told our police that you should move out of your apartment, Fabiana.
[00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.150]  You've got Carolina here.
[00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.949]  They advised us to leave because we have--
[00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.310]  oh, my god.
[00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.990]   First responders were told that the building was going to be blown up.
[00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.950]  [EXPLOSION]
[00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.950]  Oh, my god.
[00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.950]  You hear that?
[00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.150]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.950]  It'll be coming down.
[00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.430]  The building is about to blow up.
[00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.430]  Move it back.
[00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.430]  We are walking back to the building.
[00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.910]  We're about to blow up.
[00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.470]  And you guys knew this was coming all day.
[00:04:41.045 --> 00:04:49.710]  We had heard reports that the building was unstable and that it would eventually either come down on its own or it would be taken down.
[00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.053]  The BBC reported live on air that the building already collapsed before it did.
[00:04:55.533 --> 00:04:58.995]  Television viewers could see it in the background still standing.
[00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:02.680]  I was talking about the Salomon Brothers building collapsing.
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.982]  And indeed it has.
[00:05:04.042 --> 00:05:08.989]  Apparently that's only a few hundred yards away from where the World Trade Center towers were.
[00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.213]  And it seems that this was not a result of a new attack.
[00:05:12.594 --> 00:05:14.757]  It was because the building had been weakened.
[00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:21.204]  And the investigation never even investigated for explosives.
[00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:30.990]  The Republican White House then signed into law the Patriot Act, which allowed the next Democrat White House to target U.S.
[00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.212]  civilians as if they were domestic terrorists.
[00:05:34.953 --> 00:05:46.901]  And they amended the Defense Authorization Act, which allowed the next Republican White House to experiment on the American people with deadly gene therapy and nanotech vaccines.
[00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:54.124]  The same people who did 9-11 are pulling off the climate hoax and the deadly COVID shots.
[00:05:54.804 --> 00:05:56.985]  They run both parties of our government.
[00:05:57.766 --> 00:06:01.607]  Many have forgotten and it's time to wake up before they kill us all.
[00:06:02.548 --> 00:06:06.548]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:06:06.548 --> 00:06:18.548]  [Music]
[00:06:18.548 --> 00:06:26.827]   Well, you better strap yourselves in today, because we have got incredibly important information to
[00:06:26.827 --> 00:06:27.548]  cover.
[00:06:28.355 --> 00:06:29.656]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:29.676 --> 00:06:32.618]  We're going to be here live for the next four hours.
[00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:37.122]  Owen Schroyer can't host his show today.
[00:06:37.782 --> 00:06:43.206]  He's getting on an airplane to fly to D.C., where they're trying to put him in prison.
[00:06:44.338 --> 00:06:56.925]  And they say in the recommended sentencing document that the prosecutors put out because he's unrepentant and months ago on his show said he does believe the 2020 election was stolen.
[00:06:58.066 --> 00:07:05.250]  Open murder of the First Amendment in everybody's face.
[00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:06.291]  Cut and dry.
[00:07:07.652 --> 00:07:09.773]  But it's the same with everything else that's happening.
[00:07:10.213 --> 00:07:22.632]   California court California courts can seize transgender kids from parents if they do not affirm children as young as five being fast-tracked to be sterilized.
[00:07:23.513 --> 00:07:24.774]  That's the end of parental rights.
[00:07:26.455 --> 00:07:29.217]  We've got the governor of New Mexico on Friday.
[00:07:29.257 --> 00:07:30.678]  This is the biggest story out there.
[00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:32.620]  We have our whole press conference.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.823]  We're going to be covering it coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:07:37.185 --> 00:07:41.827]  And she said, I don't care about your Second Amendment or your First Amendment.
[00:07:41.847 --> 00:07:43.088]  They're not absolute.
[00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:54.634]  I'm declaring an emergency because of spikes in crime in one city in their state by criminals where they've defunded the police.
[00:07:56.995 --> 00:08:03.199]  So you see how the operation works.
[00:08:04.321 --> 00:08:05.842]  All part of undermining the society.
[00:08:06.382 --> 00:08:18.571]  And then as it collapses with open borders and defunded police and criminals being let out of jail for super violent crimes in just a couple days in many cases, that encourages them to go crazy.
[00:08:19.712 --> 00:08:31.120]  And then the same left doing it all, enabling it all, comes out and says, well, we're going to have to declare a health emergency and take your guns.
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:35.428]   Remember what the CDC did two years ago.
[00:08:35.728 --> 00:08:39.469]  Without law, they're not a Congress.
[00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:43.870]  They're just a federal agency.
[00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:47.271]  They said all rents are forgiven.
[00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:55.073]  Of course, that would completely destroy the economy, but it was just testing the waters to get you ready for a civil emergency.
[00:08:55.473 --> 00:08:57.173]  And they said, we're in a health emergency.
[00:08:57.193 --> 00:09:00.494]  And they already tried to make people for six months not have any rent.
[00:09:01.294 --> 00:09:03.175]  And they went, well, it's just going to be for the next few years.
[00:09:05.165 --> 00:09:06.225]  That's totally unlawful.
[00:09:06.265 --> 00:09:07.146]  Doesn't make any sense.
[00:09:07.186 --> 00:09:08.066]  It's totally crazy.
[00:09:09.567 --> 00:09:10.447]  And they still tried it.
[00:09:10.487 --> 00:09:13.108]  The Supreme Court said, no, you've got to stop it.
[00:09:14.768 --> 00:09:28.713]  So they're pushing the envelope here and they're getting us ready to live under emergency rule as they undermine the very sovereignty of the world and the infrastructures that we survive on.
[00:09:30.154 --> 00:09:42.499]   We have, of course, the incredible FUBAS, And bizarre behavior of Biden reaching next level weirdness at the G20 Summit in Vietnam.
[00:09:45.081 --> 00:09:57.311]  We also have the EU and UN openly announcing global censorship, EU treaty, UN health treaty to take full control of your body with vaccine passports, global digital world ID.
[00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:02.455]  So that's from the head of the IMF, the head of the World Bank, the head of the EU, it's all being announced.
[00:10:04.102 --> 00:10:13.971]  Also, all over the world, white people are being excluded from public spaces, from university public spaces like the parks.
[00:10:15.734 --> 00:10:25.018]  And even the schools themselves on certain days, for quote, minority only, even though white people are 7% of the world population, you can see how it works.
[00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:36.144]  The global billionaire elite bring in giant third world populations, brainwash them to hate white people, and then train them that white people have no rights, and then wants the white people to have no rights, no one else has any rights.
[00:10:37.024 --> 00:10:40.006]  So white people are being set up as the first minority to be targeted.
[00:10:41.124 --> 00:10:43.145]  Just like Hitler did with the Jews.
[00:10:44.025 --> 00:10:49.987]  And bizarrely enough, we have the ADL quarterbacking the entire Hitlerian project.
[00:10:50.007 --> 00:10:54.748]  Because it's very Hitlerian to persecute certain groups of people just because of what color they are.
[00:10:55.048 --> 00:10:58.489]  That's why I call the ADL the real Nazis by a real yardstick.
[00:10:58.849 --> 00:11:01.770]  Just because they claim they're a Jewish civil rights group means nothing.
[00:11:04.599 --> 00:11:07.280]  I'm not saying there are actual Nazis that follow Adolf Hitler either.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.782]  I'm saying it's the most Hitlerian thing around.
[00:11:11.502 --> 00:11:12.943]  That they're writing up the policy.
[00:11:12.963 --> 00:11:14.563]  I have a stack of news here.
[00:11:15.184 --> 00:11:16.684]  Inclusion, Harvard style.
[00:11:17.805 --> 00:11:19.405]  DEI department.
[00:11:20.566 --> 00:11:22.367]  That's the diversity and inclusion department.
[00:11:23.347 --> 00:11:27.209]  Host back to school bash for everyone who isn't white.
[00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.131]  Meanwhile folks are fighting back.
[00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:31.511]  Dutch.
[00:11:32.955 --> 00:11:34.236]  Authorities have had enough.
[00:11:34.776 --> 00:11:36.237]  They've removed the leader of the government.
[00:11:37.077 --> 00:11:37.737]  The people have.
[00:11:37.837 --> 00:11:42.720]  And now, they've had enough of the leftists blocking roads and highways.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.601]  They're now attacking them back with water cannons.
[00:11:46.902 --> 00:11:48.022]  That is certainly good news.
[00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:54.345]  And all over the world, the left is being rightfully protested and stood up to.
[00:11:54.385 --> 00:11:55.386]  And so are their puppet leaders.
[00:11:55.786 --> 00:12:00.388]  Macron booed at Rugby World Cup opening ceremony.
[00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:04.217]  Into oblivion.
[00:12:06.479 --> 00:12:13.564]  And we've got so many other big reports here, but one of the big ones is Elon Musk.
[00:12:13.824 --> 00:12:21.890]  And I noticed viral videos that was sent from YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter this weekend.
[00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:30.790]   We're talking some of the million plus views, but a bunch of others are like 100,000, 200,000, 50,000 views.
[00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.790]  And I think it's great.
[00:12:33.257 --> 00:12:34.317]  This is bringing more listeners here.
[00:12:34.557 --> 00:12:35.258]  Attacks are great.
[00:12:36.418 --> 00:12:42.539]  Saying Jones is controlled opposition because he's saying Elon Musk is joining us.
[00:12:44.119 --> 00:12:45.799]  I'm not saying Elon Musk is perfect.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.420]  I'm not saying I trust him.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:55.561]  I'm saying the moves he's making are, capital D, devastating to the new world order right now.
[00:12:57.582 --> 00:13:09.652]   And whether it's the New York Times or the New Yorker Magazine or CNN, they're calling for his arrest and calling him a Russian agent.
[00:13:11.533 --> 00:13:16.055]  And the ADL says he's the number one enemy and has taken 56% of his sponsors.
[00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:20.677]  So make no mistake, the people running things don't like Elon Musk.
[00:13:21.378 --> 00:13:23.599]  Now maybe he's trying to take over the operation from them.
[00:13:24.119 --> 00:13:25.099]  Maybe that's what's happening.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.081]  I don't see into his brain.
[00:13:30.111 --> 00:13:34.313]  But it's easy to sit back and Tucker Carlson wakes up, and Joe Rogan wakes up, and RFK Jr.
[00:13:34.353 --> 00:13:42.257]  wakes up, and Tulsi Gabbard wakes up, and Russell Brand wakes up, and Jimmy Dore wakes up, and the list goes on and on.
[00:13:42.278 --> 00:13:45.839]  I mean, basically anybody that's popular now is attacking the New World Order.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.661]  And a lot of folks are going to do it because it is popular.
[00:13:49.281 --> 00:13:51.442]  I know Tucker's totally for real and awake, and I love him to death.
[00:13:51.963 --> 00:13:53.904]  I know Joe, love him to death, known him 25 years.
[00:13:54.344 --> 00:13:55.264]  It's a real process for him.
[00:13:55.304 --> 00:13:55.785]  He's a good guy.
[00:13:58.891 --> 00:13:59.712]  This is real!
[00:14:00.392 --> 00:14:17.984]  We have to be ready to reject the New World Order, and when prominent people join us and say no to the ESGs, or no to human smuggling, or no to UN takeover, or no to new lockdowns, or no to war with Russia, we can't just sit back because it makes you feel more official.
[00:14:18.364 --> 00:14:19.985]  Oh, that's a loyal opposition.
[00:14:20.085 --> 00:14:21.166]  Oh, they're controlled.
[00:14:21.506 --> 00:14:23.428]  Nobody gets successful unless they're controlled.
[00:14:23.888 --> 00:14:25.169]  I see that meme everywhere.
[00:14:26.107 --> 00:14:28.548]  Really, some of these accounts attacking us are getting millions of views.
[00:14:28.889 --> 00:14:29.749]  You're successful?
[00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.870]  Are you controlled?
[00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.651]  No, it's just a way for people to say they're the best.
[00:14:34.652 --> 00:14:40.055]  Well, I'm not here to say I'm the only one that knows this, and I'm the grandmaster, and you gotta come to me for the answers.
[00:14:40.856 --> 00:14:57.367]   No, I'm here to put the truth out, and I bet on humanity, and I believe as it becomes apparent that the globalists are going to destroy everything, and nobody's immune, even if you're Elon Musk, they're getting ready to chop his firstborn son's genitals off.
[00:14:57.848 --> 00:14:59.569]  It's reported he's getting ready for the transition.
[00:15:01.151 --> 00:15:02.652]  His brother almost died from the shot.
[00:15:02.672 --> 00:15:04.093]  A bunch of other people he knows got sick.
[00:15:05.134 --> 00:15:06.996]  And he said, I'm pissed off at you people.
[00:15:07.316 --> 00:15:08.377]  And they're coming after him.
[00:15:10.126 --> 00:15:12.127]  And, I mean, I'm pretty common sense.
[00:15:12.227 --> 00:15:24.755]  I think as people get abused, like we all have, by the New World Order, even people that went along with this utopia lie, are going to go, this isn't a utopia, this is a dystopic hell, hellscape, this is a horrible plan.
[00:15:25.776 --> 00:15:28.037]  I believe we're going to say no to it and back it off.
[00:15:28.717 --> 00:15:36.002]  But if every time somebody comes over to our side, Vivek, Raman, Swani, you name it, we go, oh, I think you're controlled because you used to be with the enemy.
[00:15:36.022 --> 00:15:37.623]  That's how you lose a war.
[00:15:38.789 --> 00:15:43.993]  No, we want to start winning and have the enemy operatives see we're winning and jump over to us.
[00:15:45.033 --> 00:15:46.575]  Doesn't mean we always trust them.
[00:15:46.775 --> 00:15:50.037]  Doesn't mean once we win this round, we put them in charge of stuff.
[00:15:50.938 --> 00:15:54.300]  But, we certainly accept them.
[00:15:55.781 --> 00:15:56.321]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:56.341 --> 00:15:56.702]  Stay with us.
[00:15:58.368 --> 00:16:08.296]  Alright, I'm going to continue on the subject I was hitting last segment because a very prominent friend of mine is listening right now and she texted me and she said, so you trust Tulsi Gabbards?
[00:16:08.656 --> 00:16:09.277]  No, I don't.
[00:16:10.658 --> 00:16:11.999]  I'm going to explain this, okay?
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.883]  I trust people like Ron Paul, who's been around fighting the globalists for 50 years.
[00:16:19.064 --> 00:16:20.826]  I trust Rand Paul, I've known him 27 years.
[00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:29.766]   I trust People like G. Edward Griffin, been around 60 years fighting the New World Order.
[00:16:30.806 --> 00:16:32.666]  I trust myself because I know I'm for real.
[00:16:32.886 --> 00:16:35.347]  I make mistakes, I'm not perfect, but I want to defeat the globalists.
[00:16:35.447 --> 00:16:36.007]  I love freedom.
[00:16:37.667 --> 00:16:59.522]   What I'm saying about Joe Rogan getting more hardcore every day, and Tucker Carlson getting super hardcore over the last few years, and Tulsi Gabbard's now talking just like us, and RFK Jr., and now Elon Musk, and Russell Brand, and Ramaswamy, and all of them is, Whatever you think about those people, or even Donald Trump.
[00:16:59.542 --> 00:17:04.231]  He wasn't anti-New World Order 10 years ago, now he is, and I know he's for real.
[00:17:04.472 --> 00:17:05.373]  He's been through the gauntlet.
[00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:06.315]  You can see it.
[00:17:06.455 --> 00:17:07.978]  You can see the enemy attack.
[00:17:09.531 --> 00:17:16.216]  Is that what does it say about our movement against the globalist that just five years ago they were in the news saying it didn't exist.
[00:17:16.476 --> 00:17:18.277]  Now they say no new world order is good.
[00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:19.278]  Global government's good.
[00:17:19.638 --> 00:17:21.379]  You in control of your life is good.
[00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:22.760]  World currency is good.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.282]  And now all these prominent people are saying they don't want to be part of it.
[00:17:26.562 --> 00:17:28.023]  And they're super more popular.
[00:17:28.564 --> 00:17:29.524]  They were already popular.
[00:17:29.765 --> 00:17:30.725]  Now they're more popular.
[00:17:30.785 --> 00:17:34.548]  It shows freedom is popular and people are waking up.
[00:17:34.868 --> 00:17:36.089]  That's a no brainer.
[00:17:36.529 --> 00:17:37.270]  Not up for debate.
[00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.231]  Absolute celebratory issue.
[00:17:40.772 --> 00:17:42.373]  Good job, patriots at the ground level.
[00:17:43.294 --> 00:17:44.855]  And I'm not territorial about this stuff.
[00:17:44.875 --> 00:17:45.795]  Yeah, I'm an OG.
[00:17:46.376 --> 00:17:47.897]  I've been on air 29 years.
[00:17:48.197 --> 00:17:49.838]  I've been the very same person the whole time.
[00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:50.959]  I'm 100% real.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.522]  Who else can we say has been around longer and never changed course?
[00:17:54.982 --> 00:17:56.763]  Ted Nugent.
[00:17:56.783 --> 00:18:03.828]  100% Ted Nugent is absolutely as patriotic and awake and as hardcore as you can get.
[00:18:04.329 --> 00:18:06.450]  And no one's going to question, is he a secret sellout?
[00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.112]  Because he's been an OG since he was 20 years old.
[00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:15.221]  Since he was ever known publicly, he's been a pro-human, common-sense American.
[00:18:15.321 --> 00:18:17.222]  He's Americana.
[00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:18.583]  He's pre-Anti-New World Order.
[00:18:18.623 --> 00:18:19.884]  He's just America.
[00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:28.308]  But if some rocker who's been pro-globalist for a long time starts coming out against the New World Order now, I'm going to say, well, that's good!
[00:18:28.328 --> 00:18:33.171]  I mean, take people like Alice Cooper.
[00:18:33.511 --> 00:18:35.252]  He became a Christian 30-something years ago.
[00:18:36.391 --> 00:18:38.853]  He gives a lot of money to Christian Charities, he's a great golfer, blah blah blah.
[00:18:39.053 --> 00:18:40.935]  He's come out against transgenderism, he's been attacked.
[00:18:41.275 --> 00:18:43.818]  When they attacked him, he didn't apologize like Santana did.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.903]  But I'm not going to get mad at Santana for telling the truth and then getting in trouble and backing off some.
[00:18:50.624 --> 00:18:51.905]  At least he had a little courage.
[00:18:52.145 --> 00:18:54.307]  And courage is infectious.
[00:18:55.748 --> 00:19:02.914]  So I'm going to tell you again, it doesn't mean Elon Musk is our boss, it doesn't mean Elon Musk is our buddy, it doesn't mean we trust Elon Musk.
[00:19:03.962 --> 00:19:06.824]  But Elon Musk is one of the most powerful people on the Earth.
[00:19:07.544 --> 00:19:09.206]  He's under real globalist attack.
[00:19:09.766 --> 00:19:11.447]  They're calling for his arrest all over the news.
[00:19:11.927 --> 00:19:14.449]  They're calling him a super villain in major publications.
[00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:16.150]  Got the clips?
[00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.691]  Want me to play them?
[00:19:17.171 --> 00:19:20.973]  And I'm saying, the things he's doing and saying now against them.
[00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:24.376]  I know about the driverless cars and the brain chips and all his stuff.
[00:19:27.138 --> 00:19:28.659]  He's been warring to AI for a decade.
[00:19:29.119 --> 00:19:31.941]  The point is, he's turning his ship around.
[00:19:33.274 --> 00:19:42.920]  So I'm not an apologist for Elon Musk.
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:48.464]  Elon Musk says he buys into the official thing that I'm a bad guy and why I got banned on Twitter with Sandy Hook.
[00:19:48.704 --> 00:19:50.445]  That wasn't even mentioned there because that wasn't even on the radar.
[00:19:50.865 --> 00:19:58.510]  They went and dredged that up and said I was attacking people later in the future to get me banned other places and sue me and rig court cases.
[00:19:59.771 --> 00:20:01.552]  So Elon Musk has said terrible things about me.
[00:20:01.952 --> 00:20:02.433]  That's fine.
[00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:04.610]  I don't care about that.
[00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:05.810]  He hasn't come all the way.
[00:20:06.511 --> 00:20:08.392]  I'm not kissing his ass to get back on Twitter.
[00:20:09.353 --> 00:20:13.636]  The mere fact that I'm banned on Twitter makes us trend every week there and we get even more views.
[00:20:15.517 --> 00:20:32.400]   I don't expect him to fully awaken, but I knew that once he got persecuted, a person like him especially, who has, in his own words, extreme Asperger's, who just wants to problem solve, And see, technology always is a good thing.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.502]  That's been one of his pitfalls, one of his blind spots.
[00:20:35.283 --> 00:20:38.487]  That once they meshed with him, he would come fully over.
[00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:46.716]  I mean, I knew when Joe Rogan moved to Austin three years ago, and he was starting to get more hardcore and waking up and privately really starting to believe me.
[00:20:48.823 --> 00:20:53.066]  I said, Joe, go ahead and tell the truth about stuff and let them attack you, and I think you'll come all the way.
[00:20:53.426 --> 00:20:56.227]  Because I know psychology, and I know people individually.
[00:20:56.628 --> 00:21:02.731]  And they attacked him and lied about him, and now he is hardcore every day against the globalists.
[00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:05.533]  He's made a 170 from the way he used to be.
[00:21:07.154 --> 00:21:08.074]  Elon Musk has done about a 160.
[00:21:08.114 --> 00:21:08.335]  So, yeah.
[00:21:12.005 --> 00:21:19.487]  To quote Ted Nugent, great song he wrote, Stranglehold, come on, come on, come on baby, come on, come on, come on.
[00:21:19.868 --> 00:21:20.408]  Join us!
[00:21:20.968 --> 00:21:22.028]  Let's get ready to win!
[00:21:22.749 --> 00:21:24.949]  We're not the minority, we're the majority.
[00:21:25.229 --> 00:21:25.970]  We're the winners.
[00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.010]  We bet on humanity.
[00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:28.570]  The globalists bet against humanity.
[00:21:29.211 --> 00:21:32.892]  They gave people a culture of death, a culture of victimhood, a culture of weakness.
[00:21:33.172 --> 00:21:36.153]  We're giving people a culture of overcoming tyranny through God.
[00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:40.932]  And I fundamentally have told you for decades, I saw this coming.
[00:21:41.393 --> 00:21:42.393]  And we've been proven right again.
[00:21:43.294 --> 00:21:48.078]  So I spend time here saying Elon Musk is going the right direction because it's true.
[00:21:48.418 --> 00:21:51.140]  You can't deny he's turned the direction he's going.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.602]  That doesn't mean we turn the lights off in a room with him.
[00:21:55.323 --> 00:21:56.824]  Doesn't mean we put him in charge of stuff.
[00:21:56.844 --> 00:21:59.926]  It doesn't mean we laud him or think he's the savior.
[00:22:01.408 --> 00:22:06.892]  But the ADL says he's the number one enemy and they're very close to shutting him down on Twitter.
[00:22:07.714 --> 00:22:10.115]  And boy, won't you feel bad once they win if they do.
[00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:12.517]  He's betting on you.
[00:22:12.797 --> 00:22:13.577]  I'm betting on you.
[00:22:14.077 --> 00:22:15.878]  He's betting on we're gonna win.
[00:22:16.399 --> 00:22:18.080]  Because he's a very smart guy.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:19.861]  Opportunist?
[00:22:20.061 --> 00:22:20.481]  Probably.
[00:22:21.241 --> 00:22:22.442]  But hey, shows we're winning.
[00:22:23.603 --> 00:22:25.364]  But the opportunists are jumping over to us.
[00:22:25.424 --> 00:22:32.307]  So, it's an easy brain game for the weak-minded to say, Jones is an apologist from us.
[00:22:33.368 --> 00:22:34.288]  That's not what I'm doing.
[00:22:34.328 --> 00:22:44.106]   I'm saying, he's got our same enemies, Like Vladimir Putin, I don't lionize him, he's a strong man, does some bad things, but the globalists hate his guts.
[00:22:44.226 --> 00:22:50.569]  And he's not expanding a war against us, he's not coming after us, he's not opening our borders and trying to cut our children's penises off.
[00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:57.652]  So I'm going to say, Vladimir Putin is not an aggressor, he's not expansitory, the West started this war.
[00:22:57.932 --> 00:22:58.712]  That's just a fact.
[00:22:59.152 --> 00:23:00.773]  Doesn't mean I endorse Vladimir Putin either.
[00:23:02.554 --> 00:23:05.255]  Elon Musk, listen to this from The New Yorker.
[00:23:06.397 --> 00:23:10.060]  How Elon Musk went from superhero to supervillain.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.560]  You hear that?
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:20.560]  Cernovich says Jake Tapper is scum of the earth.
[00:23:21.107 --> 00:23:29.032]  This is why it disgusts me when conservatives go, wow, Jake, when he says something normal every once in a while, which is rare, stop being this way.
[00:23:30.133 --> 00:23:30.974]  And what did he say?
[00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:39.095]  Well, Jake Tapper basically said, is there any repercussions to the State Department for his, quote, treason.
[00:23:39.135 --> 00:23:41.898]  Zelensky on Starlink gate.
[00:23:42.738 --> 00:23:45.521]  Musk committing evil and driven by big ego.
[00:23:46.742 --> 00:23:53.027]  CNN Tapper demands Elon Musk face repercussions for denying Starlink to Ukraine for an attack operation.
[00:23:55.349 --> 00:24:03.253]   When I come back, I'm going to Get more into this, because, see, I'm immersed in the news, so I know the rest of the story.
[00:24:03.293 --> 00:24:03.913]  That's public.
[00:24:04.373 --> 00:24:10.515]  You can verify it for yourself in 30 seconds, then we'll get into the gunman in New Mexico and how that's a trial balloon.
[00:24:12.976 --> 00:24:14.256]  But that's what we're talking about here.
[00:24:16.137 --> 00:24:18.658]  And so this is very, very important.
[00:24:18.698 --> 00:24:19.158]  Stay with us.
[00:24:19.798 --> 00:24:20.878]  We know Ron Paul.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.640]  And Geo Griffin.
[00:24:29.148 --> 00:24:30.769]  And Ted Nugent are for real.
[00:24:32.169 --> 00:24:36.130]  Because they were blessed to grow up in families and be around people that were pure Americana.
[00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:38.731]  So they knew what was going on when they were young men.
[00:24:41.372 --> 00:24:44.052]  That's why we can look back at people like them and say, they're good.
[00:24:44.112 --> 00:24:44.993]  They're on our team.
[00:24:45.613 --> 00:24:49.774]  Just like from day one, when I was 21, it's always been the same message.
[00:24:50.234 --> 00:24:51.114]  And I've been proven right.
[00:24:51.755 --> 00:24:52.595]  Hell yeah, I'm real.
[00:24:53.732 --> 00:24:59.296]  But we can't sit there and hold people up to a G. Edward Griffin or a Ted Nugent or an Alex Jones standard.
[00:25:01.718 --> 00:25:04.280]  When people come over to our side, we don't trust them.
[00:25:05.701 --> 00:25:07.202]  But we realize we're winning.
[00:25:09.564 --> 00:25:11.305]  And that's why they're coming over to our side.
[00:25:13.627 --> 00:25:14.788]  That's how you win wars.
[00:25:17.301 --> 00:25:23.223]  So yeah, a lot of people joining us weren't awake 10 years ago or 20 years ago or even 2 years ago.
[00:25:23.923 --> 00:25:26.164]  Well look around you, the New World Order is out in the open now.
[00:25:26.684 --> 00:25:30.866]  I expected people to wake up, especially if we laid the groundwork and warned them beforehand.
[00:25:31.346 --> 00:25:33.527]  They've heard this over and over again and made fun of us.
[00:25:34.207 --> 00:25:35.167]  But I forgive them.
[00:25:36.828 --> 00:25:40.549]  Now here's how Alex Jones' brain works, and I'm going to hit the other news.
[00:25:40.569 --> 00:25:41.830]  This is important about Elon Musk.
[00:25:42.611 --> 00:25:47.754]  I follow this Ukraine World War III development very closely, as I know a lot of you do.
[00:25:49.295 --> 00:25:57.000]  And I've followed the Pentagon, and there's a battle within the Pentagon, and a battle within the neocons, and a battle within the controllers of the Democratic Party.
[00:25:59.021 --> 00:26:01.662]  Some of them want to give nuclear weapons to Ukrainians, that's a minority.
[00:26:01.682 --> 00:26:03.483]  Some of them want to give F-16s, that's a minority.
[00:26:04.064 --> 00:26:06.025]  Some of them want to give them Abrams tanks, that's a minority.
[00:26:06.705 --> 00:26:13.822]   You remember a year ago, Biden said, less than a year ago, last December, ten months ago, nine months ago.
[00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:16.402]  We can't give them Abrams tanks, that's World War III.
[00:26:16.402 --> 00:26:17.602]  That's the escalation.
[00:26:17.602 --> 00:26:21.362]  But they did it a few months later.
[00:26:21.362 --> 00:26:29.201]   So when I see the news that broke last week, that we already knew about, that must gave all these starlinks
[00:26:29.201 --> 00:26:35.642]   to their military when they were being attacked and being seen as the Russians launching an invasion,
[00:26:35.642 --> 00:26:39.961]   even though they were responding to the Western proxy war escalation.
[00:26:39.961 --> 00:26:41.241]  I'm not defending the Russians.
[00:26:41.241 --> 00:26:44.240]  That's just a fact.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:51.362]   People like Fareed Zarkaria and the rest of them, with George Soros, bragged about it on television,
[00:26:51.362 --> 00:26:54.881]  that they started it and were very proud of it.
[00:26:54.732 --> 00:27:04.852]   And then when they started using these drone boats to sink Russian ships, including ships
[00:27:04.852 --> 00:27:15.972]   in Russian territory that wasn't even in Ukraine on the Black Sea, the State Department got
[00:27:15.972 --> 00:27:19.012]   little concerned just like the State Department, not Elon Musk.
[00:27:19.537 --> 00:27:23.059]  But the State Department makes these decisions and the Pentagon basically goes with what Biden says.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:29.603]  Remember a year and a half ago, the Ukrainians wanted 300 to 500 mile range missiles.
[00:27:30.623 --> 00:27:31.884]  And you can look it up.
[00:27:33.004 --> 00:27:33.345]  U.S.
[00:27:33.425 --> 00:27:35.426]  refuses Ukraine long range missiles.
[00:27:35.466 --> 00:27:35.906]  Type it in.
[00:27:35.946 --> 00:27:36.686]  Anybody can do this.
[00:27:36.746 --> 00:27:37.307]  Don't believe me?
[00:27:37.347 --> 00:27:37.707]  Look it up.
[00:27:40.421 --> 00:27:41.902]  First they'd only give them 20-mile range.
[00:27:41.942 --> 00:27:43.162]  Now they give them 50-mile range.
[00:27:43.483 --> 00:27:44.703]  The British have gone the furthest.
[00:27:44.723 --> 00:28:00.631]  They've given them 100-mile range, 1,000-pound warhead cruise missiles that the Ukrainians have now been shooting into what the Russians have said are their area in southern Ukraine.
[00:28:00.892 --> 00:28:03.473]  But now they say they want to attack Russia proper.
[00:28:03.493 --> 00:28:05.254]  They've been doing it with drones and stuff they've got.
[00:28:06.138 --> 00:28:12.660]  And the Russians said, if you keep doing that, we'll consider it an act of war with NATO, we'll go ahead and attack NATO targets.
[00:28:14.261 --> 00:28:19.623]  So, there it is, US in no hurry to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles.
[00:28:19.843 --> 00:28:21.484]  In no hurry, Washington Post, whatever that means.
[00:28:24.004 --> 00:28:40.549]   So they're spinning this like Elon Musk, who has a civilian satellite system called SpaceX's Starlink, Calls up the Pentagon, and CNN has confirmed this, and Musk says, yeah, it's true.
[00:28:42.231 --> 00:28:50.903]  And he says, I'm concerned, and the Pentagon talks to Ukrainians, and they agree to not use these in Russian territories, on the Black Sea.
[00:28:52.824 --> 00:29:02.809]  Then the Pentagon gets word that the Ukrainians are about to launch 50 of these at the Russian fleet in anchor, which will be a Pearl Harbor, and the Russians will then launch a major attack.
[00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.851]  So, Musk told the truth, and that's in the book, too.
[00:29:06.251 --> 00:29:08.312]  The media spun it like Musk just turned these off.
[00:29:08.652 --> 00:29:12.735]  Musk is on the phone with the Pentagon and the State Department and the CIA.
[00:29:13.515 --> 00:29:14.536]  Thank God he works hard.
[00:29:16.197 --> 00:29:26.178]   And they decide while the boats have been launched, because it takes Many hours from the maneuver at night from their port to attack the Russians to kill it.
[00:29:27.859 --> 00:29:35.705]  So the Pentagon had a moment of sanity and agreed with Musk, who was on the phone with them, and he'd also been on the phone with the Russians.
[00:29:35.805 --> 00:29:41.549]  They were on the phone together, like Kennedy was on the phone with Khrushchev in the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:43.731]  And they decided to kill it.
[00:29:44.611 --> 00:29:46.793]  And the Ukrainians refused to turn the attack back.
[00:29:49.039 --> 00:30:00.944]  That's why the Pentagon has just removed the leadership of their military, because they're not, and I'm not defending the Pentagon, but the Ukrainian government's out of control trying to start World War III, so even the Pentagon is trying to put controls on this.
[00:30:01.604 --> 00:30:03.685]  Because this can lead to World War III very quickly.
[00:30:03.905 --> 00:30:06.006]  We're already in World War III, but nuclear World War III.
[00:30:06.747 --> 00:30:12.009]  So I know that Elon Musk was talking, it's in the book, and they admit it's real.
[00:30:16.627 --> 00:30:19.048]  All in a joint call on the red phone.
[00:30:22.048 --> 00:30:24.569]  And the Russians are saying, we will launch nuclear weapons if we do this.
[00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:26.169]  We will attack NATO bases.
[00:30:26.529 --> 00:30:27.169]  Don't do it.
[00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:27.869]  We're telling you.
[00:30:28.609 --> 00:30:30.070]  You hit us, we know you're getting it ready.
[00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:31.130]  We're going to hit you.
[00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.051]  Pentagon State Department says, yeah, let's not do this to Ukrainians.
[00:30:35.391 --> 00:30:36.571]  Ukrainians ignore it.
[00:30:36.991 --> 00:30:43.753]  The CIA and the Pentagon pick up the ships launched, the drone ships, and they call Musk up and say, kill it.
[00:30:44.933 --> 00:30:45.613]  That's what happened.
[00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:53.916]  Now to show there's an internal battle within our government over this, just like on the day of Kennedy, it was LL Emmonson and Colonel Slimay won a nuclear war with Russia.
[00:30:54.276 --> 00:30:56.498]  He said no, he had to remove them.
[00:30:56.518 --> 00:31:10.972]  And it's the same thing here, there's different camps in the government, but the decision was made by the Pentagon, the State Department, with the Russians, not to attack the Russian fleet, plus they knew the attack was coming.
[00:31:13.419 --> 00:31:16.682]  Musk does that, and then they turn around.
[00:31:16.722 --> 00:31:22.746]  That's one when the Secretary of State Blinken was on, we'll play the clip in a minute and skip this break, with Jake Tapper.
[00:31:23.587 --> 00:31:29.992]  He would not talk trash about Musk, saying we're very thankful to Starlink because they're using it against him all over the battlefield.
[00:31:31.593 --> 00:31:33.414]  Musk actually went in on the Ukrainian war.
[00:31:33.635 --> 00:31:35.096]  He supplied thousands of units.
[00:31:35.696 --> 00:31:37.137]  He's actually attacking the Russians.
[00:31:37.658 --> 00:31:38.919]  He's in a meeting with the Pentagon.
[00:31:38.959 --> 00:31:40.340]  He's obviously a Pentagon front.
[00:31:42.176 --> 00:31:44.818]  But he represents the Pentagon front that doesn't want World War III.
[00:31:44.838 --> 00:31:49.120]  See, he does represent a deep state faction that's not completely insane.
[00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:59.927]  So it's all public, if you actually were watching and studying the whole time, that Musk was talking to the State Department, the Pentagon, and the Russians on the same phone calls.
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.842]  And the decision was made to kill the boats.
[00:32:05.822 --> 00:32:09.204]  That's why Blinken, when Tapper brings it up, goes, let's not talk about that.
[00:32:09.265 --> 00:32:10.345]  I don't want to discuss that.
[00:32:10.745 --> 00:32:15.409]  We're very thankful for the Starling because he knows damn well the Pentagon paid to put those things up.
[00:32:15.929 --> 00:32:18.030]  And Musk is a front of the deep state.
[00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.931]  Come on, let's not be.
[00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:19.952]  We know that.
[00:32:20.332 --> 00:32:21.493]  I don't, quote, trust him.
[00:32:21.813 --> 00:32:26.056]  I'm saying why is he against censorship, against the globalists, at least on the surface?
[00:32:26.536 --> 00:32:32.120]  Because he represents a faction in our government that doesn't want to have World War Three.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.661]  Let's be big boys and girls about this.
[00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:56.867]  But the globalists know the public is so informationally illiterate, so informationally deficient, that they just hear, oh Elon Musk, well wait, we're told big tech owns their own companies, owns their own satellites, owns their own servers, so they can censor Americans all day long about Hunter Biden laptops, that's their right.
[00:32:57.788 --> 00:33:04.356]   But when an oligarch, you know, business owner tycoon doesn't want to have World War III,
[00:33:04.356 --> 00:33:10.997]  he now needs to be arrested.
[00:33:10.884 --> 00:33:12.706]  He's a traitor, and that's what Zelensky says.
[00:33:13.827 --> 00:33:15.909]  So what you're seeing is real politics, folks.
[00:33:16.269 --> 00:33:17.210]  What's really going on?
[00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:34.153]   And there's a war in our government between the establishment that want power and control, but they don't want to vaporize their grandchildren, and the Hegelian, Straussian, Hitlerian, Power cult that says let's just do this and let's get this done.
[00:33:34.353 --> 00:33:43.396]  Because even if there's a nuclear war, they'll get full control here in America and take out their opposition here and cement their power and turn us into a fascist state that'll make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[00:33:44.877 --> 00:33:45.297]  Comprende?
[00:33:46.598 --> 00:33:50.721]  So you're getting real analysis, high-level breakdown here, not a bunch of pap.
[00:33:51.261 --> 00:33:56.184]  Oh, Elon Musk is a Russian agent, or he's a hero for Ukraine.
[00:33:56.624 --> 00:34:11.574]  No, he's somebody that's got tens of thousands of satellites in space that was paid for and launched by the Pentagon, and the Pentagon is in a battle with itself not to destroy itself, even though the Pentagon doesn't care about America.
[00:34:11.994 --> 00:34:14.696]  They admit in their own press conferences, oh, we care about our interest.
[00:34:15.475 --> 00:34:16.656]  The military-industrial complex.
[00:34:16.916 --> 00:34:23.022]  But Musk did that in consultation with the Pentagon, the State Department, with the Russians, and killed those attacks.
[00:34:23.503 --> 00:34:36.335]  Just like our Pentagon will not ship missiles with farther than a 50-mile range to the Ukrainians because they will not follow orders to not use them only inside Ukraine.
[00:34:37.853 --> 00:34:40.997]  And now it's not a defensive operation, even though that's a false argument.
[00:34:41.317 --> 00:34:48.064]  Now it's an offensive operation, and that leads us up into the 30s on the Rand Corporation threat ladder, which means nuclear war.
[00:34:48.805 --> 00:34:48.965]  Okay?
[00:34:49.506 --> 00:34:51.048]  So this is big boy talk here.
[00:34:51.388 --> 00:34:53.310]  This is Dr. Strangelove for real.
[00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:57.294]  Dr. Strangelove is a great Stanley Kubrick movie based on stuff that happened two years before.
[00:34:58.123 --> 00:35:03.087]  With President Kennedy, LL Emmonster, and Curtis LeMay, the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:06.869]  And Plan R and all that was a real thing and a real plan they had.
[00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:09.251]  And it came out in Operation Northwoods in 2000.
[00:35:09.871 --> 00:35:16.416]  A plan to attack American cities, blame it on Russia, go to nuclear war with Russia.
[00:35:16.676 --> 00:35:18.237]  Kennedy said, you're crazy, you're fired.
[00:35:18.497 --> 00:35:20.219]  And a year and a half later, they said, no, you're fired.
[00:35:20.299 --> 00:35:20.559]  Boom.
[00:35:22.196 --> 00:35:29.740]  But at least the debate had been won about mutually assured destruction to not start a war with Russia and put MAD into place.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:37.244]  So you gotta know history, you gotta know all the backstops, you gotta know the frontstops, you gotta know all this to know the information.
[00:35:39.485 --> 00:35:44.187]  And I'm just trying to have a big boy discussion here on air, and in World War III.
[00:35:45.128 --> 00:35:49.070]  Not because I'm a Russian agent, but because I'm an agent of humanity and the future.
[00:35:49.918 --> 00:35:51.259]  And I am an American firster.
[00:35:51.499 --> 00:35:52.340]  That's my pedigree.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.321]  That's my family.
[00:35:53.641 --> 00:35:55.082]  Can't get a better pedigree.
[00:35:55.402 --> 00:35:56.943]  And people shouldn't live off their pedigrees.
[00:35:56.963 --> 00:36:01.767]  But in the past, that was always trusted because past family is always the best indication of future action.
[00:36:02.007 --> 00:36:02.847]  That's how genetics work.
[00:36:03.048 --> 00:36:04.609]  This dog's an incredible hunting dog.
[00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:05.710]  It's the best we ever had.
[00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.091]  It just made it with one of our other best hunting dogs.
[00:36:08.111 --> 00:36:10.133]  We think we're gonna get some badass hunting dogs out of this.
[00:36:10.353 --> 00:36:11.274]  And you almost always do.
[00:36:11.934 --> 00:36:14.415]  Okay, so I come from the best American dogs there are.
[00:36:14.615 --> 00:36:15.776]  Not bragging, it's just fact, folks.
[00:36:15.916 --> 00:36:16.777]  I'm not going to go into it.
[00:36:16.877 --> 00:36:18.537]  It's ridiculous, my family history.
[00:36:18.838 --> 00:36:25.961]  It's star-studded, whole nine yards, all the way back to the beginning, the Mayflower, 7076, founding Texas, everything.
[00:36:26.662 --> 00:36:28.943]  But I don't live off the laurels of my ancestors.
[00:36:29.663 --> 00:36:33.227]  I have been a dutiful American.
[00:36:33.627 --> 00:36:34.828]  I have been a stalwart American.
[00:36:34.848 --> 00:36:35.989]  I've been a faithful American.
[00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:37.891]  I've defended our country at every level.
[00:36:38.392 --> 00:36:41.875]  And World War III with Russia is not good for our nation or anybody else.
[00:36:43.036 --> 00:36:50.983]  And Elon Musk is simply part of a highly intelligent clique in the establishment that does not want World War III.
[00:36:52.665 --> 00:36:52.965]  That's it.
[00:36:53.905 --> 00:36:55.826]  He supplied over 10,000 Starlinks.
[00:36:56.246 --> 00:36:58.007]  Their main military's run off of it.
[00:36:58.267 --> 00:37:02.906]   Those little drones you see killing Russians every day on the videos, that's Elon Musk.
[00:37:02.906 --> 00:37:12.907]   So let's play a Jake Tapper clip with the Secretary of State Blinken.
[00:37:13.053 --> 00:37:14.454]  And notice Blinken is Blinken.
[00:37:15.339 --> 00:37:22.006]  He's blinking his eye because he knows Blinken was on the call and said, turn the ships off!
[00:37:22.306 --> 00:37:23.908]  Don't blow up the Russian fleet!
[00:37:26.851 --> 00:37:32.016]  But there's Tapper representing the neocon foaming at the mouth group saying, you better do something to him.
[00:37:33.137 --> 00:37:34.478]  This is what's really going on, folks.
[00:37:34.598 --> 00:37:35.039]  Here's the clip.
[00:37:36.041 --> 00:37:53.293]  SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has recently confirmed a report that's in Walter Isaacson's new biography of Musk that last year Musk blocked access to his Starlink satellite network in Crimea in order to disrupt a major Ukrainian attack on the Russian Navy there.
[00:37:53.313 --> 00:38:09.344]   In other words, Musk effectively sabotaged a military operation by Ukraine, a US ally, against Russia, an aggressor country that invaded a US Jake, I can't speak to a specific episode.
[00:38:09.645 --> 00:38:13.569]  Here's what I can tell you.
[00:38:17.114 --> 00:38:27.524]  Starlink has been a vital tool for the Ukrainians to be able to communicate with each other and particularly for the military to communicate in their effort to defend all of Ukraine's territory.
[00:38:27.984 --> 00:38:32.088]  It remains so and I would expect it to continue to be critical to their efforts.
[00:38:32.128 --> 00:38:38.955]  So what we would hope and expect is that that technology will remain fully available to the Ukrainians.
[00:38:39.415 --> 00:38:40.917]  It is vital to what they're doing.
[00:38:42.113 --> 00:38:43.374]  I don't know that you can't speak to it.
[00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:44.554]  You won't speak to it.
[00:38:45.035 --> 00:38:50.698]  Musk says he was reportedly afraid that Russia would retaliate with nuclear weapons.
[00:38:51.098 --> 00:38:57.461]  Musk says that's based on his private discussions he had with senior Russian officials.
[00:38:57.921 --> 00:39:05.145]  Are you concerned that Musk is apparently conducting his own diplomatic outreach to the Russian government?
[00:39:06.946 --> 00:39:23.277]  If you read the articles that are all confirmed, and CNN's own report, which Tapper's covering up, with the State Department, he was in trilateral discussions with SpaceX, Starlink, the Russians, and the U.S.
[00:39:23.297 --> 00:39:23.657]  government.
[00:39:25.178 --> 00:39:25.738]  And again, the U.S.
[00:39:25.758 --> 00:39:28.920]  government at that time a year ago said, we don't want offensive operations into Russia.
[00:39:29.141 --> 00:39:29.941]  They denied the missiles.
[00:39:29.961 --> 00:39:31.202]  I got an article right here, let me show it to you.
[00:39:32.432 --> 00:39:33.312]  This is ABC News.
[00:39:33.772 --> 00:39:34.072]  U.S.
[00:39:34.112 --> 00:39:38.973]  likely to send long-range ATACMS missiles to Ukraine for the first time.
[00:39:39.314 --> 00:39:42.794]  So see, the Pentagon and the war planners said, this is too dangerous.
[00:39:43.294 --> 00:39:45.255]  We can't send front-line Abrams tanks.
[00:39:45.315 --> 00:39:46.735]  We can't send long-range missiles.
[00:39:47.055 --> 00:39:48.396]  We can't send F-16s.
[00:39:48.676 --> 00:39:50.116]  We can't send cruise missiles.
[00:39:50.356 --> 00:39:51.896]  If we do that, it escalates into World War III.
[00:39:52.597 --> 00:39:55.677]  So Musk, a year ago, was just going along with policy.
[00:39:55.997 --> 00:39:58.838]  He's now bad because the policy's changed.
[00:40:01.803 --> 00:40:04.204]  The lunatics in our government are doing things never done before.
[00:40:04.284 --> 00:40:06.205]  They're playing with thermonuclear fire.
[00:40:06.405 --> 00:40:06.825]  Continue.
[00:40:08.786 --> 00:40:11.367]  Diplomatic outreach to the Russian government.
[00:40:11.787 --> 00:40:13.428]  Really, none of this concerns you?
[00:40:16.192 --> 00:40:20.254]  Jake, I can't speak to conversations that may or may not have happened.
[00:40:20.334 --> 00:40:20.794]  I don't know.
[00:40:20.814 --> 00:40:27.378]  I'm focused on the fact that the technology itself, Starlink, has been really important to the Ukrainians.
[00:40:27.658 --> 00:40:28.298]  It remains so.
[00:40:28.678 --> 00:40:36.962]  And it should continue to be part of what they're able to call on to be able to communicate with themselves and, again, to have the military be able to communicate.
[00:40:39.031 --> 00:40:52.223]  Throughout this Russian aggression, we ourselves have always had to factor in what Russia may do in response to any given thing that we or others do or the Ukrainians do.
[00:40:52.924 --> 00:40:54.185]  And we have.
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:00.602]  What's so critical now is that Ukrainians had real success over the past year.
[00:41:00.962 --> 00:41:02.603]  I was just in Ukraine, as you know.
[00:41:03.764 --> 00:41:05.925]  The last time I was there was almost exactly a year ago.
[00:41:06.826 --> 00:41:15.130]  In that year, from the last time I was there till this week, the Ukrainians have retaken more than 50% of the territory seized by Russia since February of 2022.
[00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:18.011]  They're now engaged in a critical counter-offensive.
[00:41:18.792 --> 00:41:24.315]  And we're doing everything we can to maximize our support for them, along with many other countries, so that they can be successful.
[00:41:24.895 --> 00:41:30.777]  Starlink is an important part of their success, and as I said, we expect that it will continue to be so.
[00:41:31.337 --> 00:41:33.238]  It sounds like Starlink's so important that the U.S.
[00:41:33.278 --> 00:41:39.901]  government doesn't want to risk offending a capricious billionaire who did some things that I think in another situation the U.S.
[00:41:39.921 --> 00:41:42.922]  government might want to say something about, but let's move on.
[00:41:43.622 --> 00:41:44.503]  So here's what's happening.
[00:41:44.783 --> 00:41:45.763]  You want the prom analysis?
[00:41:45.783 --> 00:41:46.704]  You're gonna get it.
[00:41:46.724 --> 00:41:51.406]  You have the out-of-control Soros foaming at the mouth leftists that have captured our country and doing all this.
[00:41:52.047 --> 00:41:55.749]  But you have the actual war planners that have been saying, do not give them frontline tanks.
[00:41:56.089 --> 00:41:57.369]  Do not give them cruise missiles.
[00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:58.670]  Do not give them long-range missiles.
[00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:00.331]  Do not give them F-16s.
[00:42:00.371 --> 00:42:02.512]  The Russians have said they will escalate.
[00:42:02.532 --> 00:42:03.793]  They've barely used any of their force.
[00:42:03.833 --> 00:42:04.233]  Don't do it.
[00:42:04.493 --> 00:42:06.234]  That's our Pentagon that actually plans this.
[00:42:06.494 --> 00:42:07.595]  They're for a proxy war.
[00:42:07.635 --> 00:42:08.115]  They love it.
[00:42:08.415 --> 00:42:11.057]  They want to try to sap the Russians and beat them in a guerrilla war.
[00:42:12.742 --> 00:42:25.626]  They got Jake Tapper that doesn't know anything about military history, anything about anything, and he's sitting there, even though he can go read and knows Musk was working with our government to do this, and says he's a traitor.
[00:42:26.747 --> 00:42:30.208]  Because they want to get him because of Twitter and all the rest of the stuff he's doing.
[00:42:31.348 --> 00:42:33.409]  And bringing Trump back to Twitter and the rest of it.
[00:42:34.108 --> 00:42:42.307]   So again, it shows the schism, the fissures within the power structure and how they misrepresent
[00:42:42.307 --> 00:42:44.268]  everything.
[00:42:44.268 --> 00:42:49.228]  And they do it over and over and over again.
[00:42:49.228 --> 00:42:52.528]  Jake Tapper doesn't study this.
[00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:55.627]  Jake Tapper doesn't immerse himself in it.
[00:42:55.627 --> 00:42:59.369]  He gets a talking point to call for Elon Musk arrest.
[00:42:59.369 --> 00:43:04.947]   And you notice the horrible globalist Blinken is defending Musk because he knows full well
[00:43:04.947 --> 00:43:07.588]  it's all on record what went on in those meetings.
[00:43:08.077 --> 00:43:13.981]  And it's US policy a year ago to not attack those ships in anchor or not attack Russia with missiles.
[00:43:14.321 --> 00:43:21.986]  Now, that said, the decision's changed by the people politically in charge.
[00:43:23.703 --> 00:43:42.859]  Just like with Deepwater Horizon and the BP oil spill, all the engineers said, in the deepest well ever drilled at that time, 35,000, 40,000 feet, they were dumping $30 million of concrete, pumping it in the hole, because of the pressure, to keep that gas under.
[00:43:43.837 --> 00:43:53.919]  And they had some other mathematicians that said, well, we believe because it's under 10,000 feet of water, and because it's 40,000 feet under the ground, that there's some type of ambient pressure that will keep it pressurized.
[00:43:53.959 --> 00:44:05.181]  They said, no, we believe that pressure in the ocean passes on through the hole, and we believe with 99% certainty it'll blow up if you stop dumping concrete in the hole and dump seawater into it.
[00:44:07.782 --> 00:44:08.562]  They said, we don't care.
[00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:15.016]  It's costing us tens of millions a day to dump concrete, and all those ships lined up to dump concrete.
[00:44:15.036 --> 00:44:16.317]  It was a big test hole.
[00:44:16.757 --> 00:44:20.379]  They said, do not dump concrete.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:24.642]  One day later, biggest oil spill ever, completely blew up, as you know.
[00:44:24.822 --> 00:44:25.423]  Killed a bunch of people.
[00:44:26.443 --> 00:44:27.244]  And it's the same thing.
[00:44:27.304 --> 00:44:30.646]  You got a bunch of Rothschilds and globalists and old crazy people.
[00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:45.120]  They're just sitting back, this is a video game, and they go, we don't care what the Pentagon, State Department says, give them long-range missiles, give them tanks, give them F-16s, and go ahead and burn Musk for the previous policy we had.
[00:44:46.481 --> 00:44:52.721]  That's it. Think about that.
[00:44:52.785 --> 00:44:53.505]  And they even spin it.
[00:44:53.946 --> 00:45:00.951]  Musk met with the Russians on the phone with the State Department and the Pentagon and everybody else.
[00:45:02.796 --> 00:45:03.797]  That's admitted by the writer.
[00:45:04.017 --> 00:45:05.158]  They admit that in the news.
[00:45:05.178 --> 00:45:07.939]  Like, well, Musk was in a meeting with the Russians and the U.S.
[00:45:07.999 --> 00:45:10.041]  and it was really a concern.
[00:45:10.061 --> 00:45:10.721]  This would lead to it.
[00:45:10.781 --> 00:45:11.902]  All parties were concerned.
[00:45:11.962 --> 00:45:13.303]  So, Musk decided.
[00:45:14.384 --> 00:45:15.584]  Because they gave it to Musk.
[00:45:15.764 --> 00:45:17.846]  But there was no criticism of Musk at the time.
[00:45:20.492 --> 00:45:26.297]  It was admitted at the time that he turned off Starlink to that area and wouldn't give more Starlink.
[00:45:26.317 --> 00:45:26.938]  Remember all that?
[00:45:27.538 --> 00:45:32.763]  He was actually in the news then, but he was following policy, he was doing what he was told, and now imagine being Musk.
[00:45:33.344 --> 00:45:38.368]  He's followed the orders, he's done what they say, everything, and they're turning around and saying, you're a traitor, man!
[00:45:38.748 --> 00:45:40.210]  You didn't let us attack those ships!
[00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:43.192]  He's like, you told me that was a good idea.
[00:45:44.273 --> 00:45:44.834]  See how they work?
[00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:51.665]  And see, that's America losing its soft power, because these globalists backstab everybody.
[00:45:52.866 --> 00:46:00.655]  They go against all the common sense rules of humanity, all the common sense rules of diplomacy, detente, whatever you want to call it, and they're madmen.
[00:46:01.717 --> 00:46:07.170]   Because if you look at who actually runs things at the top, They're either senile or lawyers.
[00:46:07.791 --> 00:46:15.115]  Now, you've got statisticians and war planners and top physicists and people in the next to the top echelon, but they're not in command.
[00:46:15.375 --> 00:46:16.556]  They're saying, don't do this.
[00:46:17.397 --> 00:46:18.998]  I mean, they're like, stop.
[00:46:19.638 --> 00:46:20.299]  So is Musk.
[00:46:21.159 --> 00:46:22.780]  The globalists are like, we'll just have you arrested.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:23.320]  How's that sound?
[00:46:24.001 --> 00:46:25.041]  Give the weapons to Ukraine.
[00:46:25.081 --> 00:46:25.502]  Let's go.
[00:46:25.942 --> 00:46:26.322]  Let's go.
[00:46:26.382 --> 00:46:27.163]  Let's go to full war.
[00:46:27.403 --> 00:46:27.583]  All right.
[00:46:27.623 --> 00:46:28.684]  I didn't get into the gun stuff.
[00:46:29.949 --> 00:46:35.835]  Mike McDowell's popping in with big developments and his viral deposition for about 30 minutes.
[00:46:35.855 --> 00:46:37.796]  Then I'm going to hit the Declaration of War.
[00:46:37.836 --> 00:46:38.617]  It's the Second Amendment.
[00:46:38.657 --> 00:46:42.240]  Now it's a test for the rest of the country by the New Mexico governor.
[00:46:43.217 --> 00:46:46.936]   uh... will get into the fed saying for the first amendment will put in prison

[00:50:33.082 --> 00:50:33.522]  Excuse me.
[00:50:34.437 --> 00:50:37.178]  The reason I started yelling, folks, is this is life and death stuff, okay?
[00:50:37.718 --> 00:50:43.941]  And my adrenaline just goes crazy, because at a subconscious level, I realize this is combat, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:43.961 --> 00:50:47.162]  This is, this is, this is not a joke, this is not a game.
[00:50:47.182 --> 00:50:48.463]  It's not good to serve evil.
[00:50:49.343 --> 00:51:02.488]  All these globalists look like reanimated corpses, and they all just get off on destruction and power, and their empire's collapsing, sucking America down with it, and they're not gonna let it collapse without starting World War III!
[00:51:02.668 --> 00:51:03.789]  That's what all this is about!

[00:51:25.564 --> 00:51:32.886]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[00:51:33.086 --> 00:51:43.350]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're gonna crash it into the World Trade Center.

[00:52:00.577 --> 00:52:05.577]   Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:08.997]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[00:52:09.157 --> 00:52:11.459]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[00:52:11.539 --> 00:52:13.260]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:52:13.921 --> 00:52:16.502]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:52:17.303 --> 00:52:21.686]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[00:52:21.746 --> 00:52:25.288]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:52:25.528 --> 00:52:29.451]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:52:32.133 --> 00:52:39.497]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:52:39.577 --> 00:52:41.138]  They are nothing but distractions.
[00:52:41.178 --> 00:52:44.260]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:45.841]  You silenced those voices.
[00:52:45.881 --> 00:52:49.603]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:52:49.423 --> 00:52:56.222]   Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[00:52:56.222 --> 00:53:00.623]  [cheering]
[00:53:00.623 --> 00:53:08.223]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.

[00:54:11.319 --> 00:54:13.706]  InfoWars.com InfoWars comes to mind.

[00:54:16.105 --> 00:54:17.045]  You watch InfoWars?

[00:54:30.649 --> 00:54:31.849]  Quit playing this joke over here.
[00:54:32.029 --> 00:54:33.390]  That's why the deplatforming didn't work.
[00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:36.870]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:39.750]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:53.750]   Coming up in one minute, Mike Lindell on the latest fight to secure our elections and more.
[00:54:54.649 --> 00:54:55.709]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:57.710]  InfoWars.com.

[00:55:06.113 --> 00:55:11.315]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:55:14.186 --> 00:55:16.186]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:55:16.186 --> 00:55:19.825]   All right, I wanted to get Mike Lindell on this week to get an update on the great things
[00:55:19.825 --> 00:55:20.826]  he's doing.
[00:55:20.826 --> 00:55:25.826]   Then I noticed depositions from months ago with him have gone viral.
[00:55:25.826 --> 00:55:30.626]   They were trying to stir him up and make him mad with these lawsuits for him questioning
[00:55:30.626 --> 00:55:31.626]  an election.
[00:55:31.626 --> 00:55:36.186]   And that dovetails into our own reporter, Owen Schroer, that's gotten national news
[00:55:36.186 --> 00:55:37.186]  attention.
[00:55:37.186 --> 00:55:41.306]   He's flying to D.C. today for sentencing for being at the Capitol with me trying to stop
[00:55:41.306 --> 00:55:43.466]  people going in.
[00:55:43.466 --> 00:55:50.466]   And Owen, they say, needs prison time because he "questioned the election again a few months
[00:55:51.404 --> 00:55:57.447]  They asked for jail time because he, quote, is unrepentant and is questioning him again.
[00:55:57.487 --> 00:56:02.591]  So they're trying to outlaw us questioning elections when overwhelming evidence has come out of election fraud.
[00:56:02.611 --> 00:56:03.991]  So coming up, we'll play a few of the clips.
[00:56:06.233 --> 00:56:07.193]  I certainly feel for him.
[00:56:07.233 --> 00:56:08.834]  I've been tortured in these depositions as well.
[00:56:08.854 --> 00:56:11.316]  I'm being deposed again tomorrow.
[00:56:11.336 --> 00:56:12.637]  I'll be on the show for part of the show.
[00:56:13.797 --> 00:56:19.321]  But I wanted to get him on just with updates and all the things that are going on and some of the counter things he's filed.
[00:56:19.341 --> 00:56:21.142]  So Mike, thanks for giving us an update.
[00:56:22.544 --> 00:56:24.085]  Well, thanks for having me on.
[00:56:24.205 --> 00:56:27.287]  This has been an incredible weekend.
[00:56:27.627 --> 00:56:46.578]   They leaked all of my deposition or at least 20 minutes of it when I was very upset with these Lawyers, these ambulance-chasing corrupt lawyers that are, you know, start in on my pillows, calling them lumpy pillows and attacking my employees of my pillow.
[00:56:47.118 --> 00:56:49.100]  It was disgusting, Alex.
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.982]  Absolutely disgusting.
[00:56:51.502 --> 00:56:53.043]  And I just let them have it.
[00:56:53.063 --> 00:57:02.271]  Then they go, then one of the things they said, it's really important, everybody, the judge in that case was appointed by Biden a year ago in July.
[00:57:02.911 --> 00:57:13.497]  And that was her first case in history was Mike Lindell and this guy named Eric Coomer suing Mike Lindell, an ex-employee of Dominion, about this election stuff or whatever.
[00:57:13.918 --> 00:57:17.840]  Well, we put in as a frivolous case to get it dismissed.
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:23.380]   And she never ruled on it. She said, "No, I'm not going to decide yet if I want to dismiss it or not.
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:30.380]   You go ahead and spend millions of dollars on discovery, and you take a year of your time out and go do this."
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:34.480]   So I called out the judge too. The guy goes, "You know, the judge is going to see this."
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:38.580]   I said, "I don't care." I said, "This will set a precedent for our country."
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:42.379]   Well, let's be clear. That was done with me. It just happened with Giuliani.
[00:57:42.483 --> 00:57:44.023]  They don't let you have an anti-slap.
[00:57:44.043 --> 00:57:46.964]  They don't let you use the law to have a dismissal up front.
[00:57:46.984 --> 00:57:48.665]  They just forget the law and move forward.
[00:57:50.885 --> 00:57:53.546]  It is terrible, everybody, and this is going to set a precedent.
[00:57:53.886 --> 00:57:55.927]  I said to them, what about the little guy out there?
[00:57:55.967 --> 00:57:57.948]  What about somebody that doesn't have any money?
[00:57:57.968 --> 00:58:04.450]  You can put any lawsuit against anybody, and if they don't have the money, you just destroy their lives.
[00:58:05.834 --> 00:58:15.498]  And they automatically have to put up money and get a lawyer and fight it, even though it might be completely frivolous, which I was just so upset.
[00:58:15.518 --> 00:58:20.660]  So bottom line, you're being persecuted for questioning an election.
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:26.982]  I want to play some of these clips coming up, but just to show a microcosm of this, here's Tim Poole, we'll play it later after you leave.
[00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:31.595]  You're pointing out that Infowars journalist threatened with jail for his First Amendment.
[00:58:33.658 --> 00:58:39.466]  They actually put this in the sentencing document.
[00:58:39.486 --> 00:58:45.631]   The feds want jail time because Owen They say it's unrepentant.
[00:58:45.651 --> 00:58:50.334]  He questioned months ago the election again, and they talk about his show that comes on at 3 p.m.
[00:58:50.374 --> 00:58:51.515]  Central today.
[00:58:51.575 --> 00:58:52.175]  He won't be here.
[00:58:52.235 --> 00:58:53.015]  He's in D.C.
[00:58:53.456 --> 00:59:01.240]  facing this, and I'm going to show people later the actual filing, where it says, for his free speech, we want him put in jail.
[00:59:01.581 --> 00:59:02.881]  So, Mike, you said it.
[00:59:02.921 --> 00:59:05.163]  This is the end of America if they get away with this.
[00:59:05.836 --> 00:59:06.917]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:59:06.997 --> 00:59:10.039]  If we don't stand up now, we have one shot at this, everybody.
[00:59:10.099 --> 00:59:16.584]  Not only do we have to fix our election platforms, which we're making great headway, but we've got to also have courage.
[00:59:16.644 --> 00:59:17.865]  Courage is contagious.
[00:59:17.945 --> 00:59:21.708]  If you're saving your courage for a rainy day, it's pouring outside.
[00:59:22.068 --> 00:59:28.073]  And everyone can sit back and say, well, let's let everybody else cover the front lines and get behind this.
[00:59:28.113 --> 00:59:32.116]  We need everybody to get behind and stop this.
[00:59:35.610 --> 00:59:36.510]  Unbelievable!
[00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:42.952]  They can weaponize the government and the courts against everybody, and there's no constitution anymore, there's no rights.
[00:59:44.372 --> 00:59:50.013]  I'll tell you, that bugged me more than anything, that this judge couldn't even look at it for dismissal.
[00:59:50.353 --> 00:59:57.635]  What if it was completely mistaken identity, or whatever, you're not even going to look at it, you're going to say, you go ahead and spend millions of dollars.
[00:59:57.915 --> 01:00:03.876]   And you know, the bad thing about this is, or one of the bad things is, They went after my pillow!
[01:00:03.916 --> 01:00:05.277]  They sued my pillow!
[01:00:05.697 --> 01:00:06.237]  My pillow!
[01:00:06.617 --> 01:00:10.638]  They're nothing to do with their CEO out there speaking out about elections.
[01:00:10.978 --> 01:00:12.958]  These are an employee-owned company.
[01:00:12.978 --> 01:00:17.679]  I just happen to be the biggest stockholder, but it's all employee-owned company.
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.000]  And these people have families and such.
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.361]  I told these lawyers, you should be ashamed of yourself.
[01:00:23.381 --> 01:00:31.304]   You know, going after these families and these individuals and these, you know, I've No, they're not lumpy pillows.
[01:00:31.144 --> 01:00:35.144]   since I've been with me 20 years and they're just mad, they're just mad.
[01:00:35.144 --> 01:00:39.343]  They're just mad you didn't ship your company to China.
[01:00:39.343 --> 01:00:40.983]  That's what they're really mad about.
[01:00:40.983 --> 01:00:43.264]   So I wouldn't even speak to these lawyers about their conscience.
[01:00:43.264 --> 01:00:44.663]  They don't, they don't have one.
[01:00:44.663 --> 01:00:45.663]  That's who they are.
[01:00:45.663 --> 01:00:47.304]  So I want to play a few clips of this.
[01:00:47.304 --> 01:00:50.624]   Here he is trying to stir you up saying, oh, you've got lumpy pillows.
[01:00:50.624 --> 01:00:51.624]  Here it is.
[01:00:51.624 --> 01:00:52.624]  Okay.
[01:00:52.624 --> 01:00:55.183]  And I'm not asking about the lumpy pillow calls.
[01:00:55.183 --> 01:00:57.304]  No, they're not lumpy pillows.
[01:00:57.304 --> 01:00:58.904]  That's not what they call on.
[01:00:58.904 --> 01:00:59.904]  Okay.
[01:00:59.923 --> 01:01:02.545]  When you say lumpy pillows, now you're an asshole.
[01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:03.246]  You got that?
[01:01:03.546 --> 01:01:05.748]  You're an asshole, is what you are.
[01:01:05.768 --> 01:01:07.109]  No, he's an asshole.
[01:01:07.629 --> 01:01:09.551]  He's an ambulance-chasing asshole.
[01:01:09.611 --> 01:01:10.432]  That's what you are.
[01:01:11.273 --> 01:01:13.094]  Lumpy pillows kiss my ass.
[01:01:13.394 --> 01:01:14.535]  Put that in your book.
[01:01:14.555 --> 01:01:21.241]  No, if they answer anything, any problem customer that wants to reach Mike Lindell, those are the ones.
[01:01:21.341 --> 01:01:22.843]  I want to talk to Mike Lindell.
[01:01:23.163 --> 01:01:24.624]  I want to talk to Mike Lindell.
[01:01:24.864 --> 01:01:26.165]  They send them to here and they go...
[01:01:27.375 --> 01:01:34.058]  Or they call about, um, maybe they didn't get their pillow on time because of, uh, um, the FedEx or whatever.
[01:01:34.318 --> 01:01:37.060]  Well, we'll cover them, even though it could be somebody else's fault.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.641]  Nobody called because of a lumpy pillow.
[01:01:41.202 --> 01:01:42.182]  But good, good one, though.
[01:01:42.642 --> 01:01:43.062]  You done?
[01:01:44.523 --> 01:01:45.083]  Yeah, I'm done.
[01:01:45.103 --> 01:01:48.965]  What I'm saying... Obviously, you don't have my pillow, too.
[01:01:48.985 --> 01:01:50.246]  You don't, do ya?
[01:01:52.284 --> 01:01:54.565]  What I'm saying is, Mr. Lundell... Asshole!
[01:01:55.005 --> 01:01:55.426]  Go ahead.
[01:01:55.746 --> 01:01:56.426]  No, I'm pissed.
[01:01:56.926 --> 01:01:57.787]  I understand.
[01:01:57.867 --> 01:01:58.107]  Go.
[01:01:58.287 --> 01:01:59.108]  When you're saying what?
[01:01:59.128 --> 01:02:04.110]  Alright, Mike, I know you're mad they leaked this stuff, but I gotta be honest.
[01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:05.971]  All over the internet, people love you more than ever.
[01:02:06.311 --> 01:02:09.533]  People are so sick of this lawfare, they see right through this, Mike.
[01:02:10.034 --> 01:02:10.294]  Right.
[01:02:10.354 --> 01:02:12.376]  Well, they, you know, they leaked it all.
[01:02:12.416 --> 01:02:16.278]  You know, I lost my cool on that one, but there's over, there's over 20 video clips.
[01:02:16.298 --> 01:02:18.980]  That's the only one I swore in, but that's how mad I was.
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.763]  And that's the one that went viral because I was out of character by doing that.
[01:02:22.803 --> 01:02:23.503]  But you know what?
[01:02:23.523 --> 01:02:31.228]  They don't, he cut out the part where, with the stuff that they were doing, trying to antagonize me and attack my pillow and my employees.
[01:02:31.668 --> 01:02:34.110]  And I'm telling you, I don't, you know, you can attack me.
[01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:34.891]  I can take that.
[01:02:34.931 --> 01:02:35.511]  I can take that.
[01:02:35.731 --> 01:02:38.313]  You start attacking my pillow and my employees.
[01:02:38.513 --> 01:02:39.514]  You got, I got a big problem.
[01:02:39.774 --> 01:02:43.794]   problem with that especially when you're criminal to begin with you criminal
[01:02:43.794 --> 01:02:49.914]   lawyers out there and I'll tell you they you know and then for them to leak it a
[01:02:49.914 --> 01:02:54.394]   bad fired on Alex they released all these tapes that they shouldn't have all
[01:02:54.394 --> 01:02:58.434]   these clips from that they sound bit from all from these three to three
[01:02:58.434 --> 01:03:02.514]   depositions not just one that's redundant oh because they sued my pillow
[01:03:02.514 --> 01:03:06.293]   now you got to come in and represent my pillow so you have the same criminal
[01:03:06.293 --> 01:03:09.574]  crooked lawyers and this guy making faces at me.
[01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:14.162]  The guy, Eric Coomer, the guy that's actually suing me, I didn't even know who this guy was.
[01:03:14.462 --> 01:03:16.124]  He's making face and doing this stuff.
[01:03:16.384 --> 01:03:18.085]  You don't see him in the camera.
[01:03:18.486 --> 01:03:19.907]  But I'll tell you what, you're right.
[01:03:20.227 --> 01:03:22.008]  The public has took it.
[01:03:22.288 --> 01:03:26.712]  They released it thinking, oh, Mike Lindell, he's gonna, this is gonna be the end of him.
[01:03:27.378 --> 01:03:28.018]  Well, you know what?
[01:03:28.078 --> 01:03:28.679]  That's wrong.
[01:03:28.739 --> 01:03:29.679]  The people have stood up.
[01:03:29.719 --> 01:03:30.120]  They know.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.301]  I'm standing up for everybody out there.
[01:03:32.521 --> 01:03:41.927]  The guy that could, if this could happen to any one of you out there just because I speak out about our election and I want to fix our election platforms and help save our country.
[01:03:42.387 --> 01:03:43.428]  I'm speaking for everybody.
[01:03:43.488 --> 01:03:46.189]  I just happen to have a big mouth and I'm never stopping.
[01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.830]  Ever.
[01:03:48.817 --> 01:03:49.438]  Absolutely.
[01:03:49.538 --> 01:03:51.379]  And you know, I'm the same way.
[01:03:51.419 --> 01:03:53.922]  They've actually come up with some of my employees and horrible things to them.
[01:03:53.942 --> 01:03:57.505]  And that's what really gets to me because they're not doing anything and they don't deserve this.
[01:03:58.946 --> 01:03:59.727]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:03:59.747 --> 01:04:04.030]  They've gone after my dad, my sister, all these other people.
[01:04:04.571 --> 01:04:05.932]  And then they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:04:05.952 --> 01:04:07.994]  You know, they had a big Pentagon meeting a few weeks ago.
[01:04:08.034 --> 01:04:15.400]  We played the Clubs last week, where the Pentagon, people that run it now, said, we're going to harass with lawsuits everybody fighting our new world order.
[01:04:16.101 --> 01:04:16.922]  So let me finish my question, okay?
[01:04:16.782 --> 01:04:21.342]   Here's a few more clips. Just play the other two clips we've got. We've got more we're going to be playing here in a
[01:04:21.342 --> 01:04:21.782]  minute.
[01:04:21.782 --> 01:04:24.782]   But we're going to move on to Solutions and other big breaking news.
[01:04:24.782 --> 01:04:31.050]   But again, people get you're being persecuted, they're being persecuted, and you're such a sweetheart, but they
[01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:31.782]  love seeing you get angry. Here it is.
[01:04:31.782 --> 01:04:33.782]  So let me finish my question, okay?
[01:04:33.782 --> 01:04:34.782]  Yes.
[01:04:34.782 --> 01:04:36.782]  I tend to be a slow talker.
[01:04:37.422 --> 01:04:37.923]  Good for you.
[01:04:37.943 --> 01:04:39.605]  I'm from Texas originally.
[01:04:39.645 --> 01:04:40.186]  Good for you.
[01:04:40.766 --> 01:04:41.748]  I got all day.
[01:04:41.768 --> 01:04:42.629]  We'll make a week of this.
[01:04:42.669 --> 01:04:43.790]  How about that?
[01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:44.171]  Go ahead.
[01:04:45.212 --> 01:04:48.196]  Probably up to you, lawyer, but I'm happy to stay as long as you'd like.
[01:04:48.296 --> 01:04:49.037]  Just keep going.
[01:04:49.057 --> 01:04:49.958]  Alright.
[01:04:50.118 --> 01:04:51.620]  Why'd you call me an ambulance, Chase?
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:51.740]  What?
[01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:55.711]  Why did you call me an ambulance chaser?
[01:04:55.951 --> 01:04:56.832]  Because you are.
[01:04:56.852 --> 01:05:03.737]  This is a frivolous case, and if you're representing this guy and you've read this case, you are a disgusting lawyer.
[01:05:04.397 --> 01:05:06.499]  Period.
[01:05:06.839 --> 01:05:08.020]  That's my right to say.
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:10.141]  You want to sue me too, Mr. Ambulance Chaser?
[01:05:10.661 --> 01:05:13.584]  Are you working on contingency or consignment with the guy?
[01:05:14.364 --> 01:05:16.265]  I can't believe anybody would take this.
[01:05:16.886 --> 01:05:18.787]  This is absolutely disgusting.
[01:05:19.147 --> 01:05:20.749]  It's a disgrace to our country.
[01:05:21.129 --> 01:05:22.390]  It's a disgrace to you.
[01:05:24.818 --> 01:05:25.378]  Anything else?
[01:05:25.698 --> 01:05:26.299]  No, that's it.
[01:05:26.319 --> 01:05:27.619]  You asked me a question, I answered it.
[01:05:27.739 --> 01:05:28.020]  Alright.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.560]  Tell us your full name, please.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.881]  Michael James Lindell.
[01:05:31.721 --> 01:05:33.122]  Well, good morning, Mr. Lindell.
[01:05:33.322 --> 01:05:34.342]  My name is Charlie Kane.
[01:05:34.382 --> 01:05:36.303]  We met for the first time about... Who's paying you?
[01:05:37.444 --> 01:05:38.564]  About four minutes ago.
[01:05:38.784 --> 01:05:39.165]  Okay.
[01:05:39.465 --> 01:05:39.685]  Go on.
[01:05:42.186 --> 01:05:42.686]  Is that right?
[01:05:42.886 --> 01:05:43.246]  What's that?
[01:05:44.327 --> 01:05:44.987]  Is that right?
[01:05:45.267 --> 01:05:45.487]  Is what?
[01:05:45.507 --> 01:05:46.288]  What was the question?
[01:05:46.768 --> 01:05:48.189]  We met for the first time... Yes.
[01:05:48.369 --> 01:05:48.729]  Yes.
[01:05:49.369 --> 01:05:49.709]  Okay.
[01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:51.570]  Here's what we're gonna do.
[01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:52.771]  We're gonna start slow.
[01:05:54.352 --> 01:05:57.375]  Because the court reporter's trying to take down what you're saying, okay?
[01:05:58.936 --> 01:06:00.658]  Don't sit and scold me already, mister.
[01:06:00.918 --> 01:06:02.519]  I'll do whatever I have to do.
[01:06:04.481 --> 01:06:05.502]  You're just a lawyer.
[01:06:05.622 --> 01:06:06.943]  You're an ambulance-chasing lawyer.
[01:06:07.283 --> 01:06:08.484]  So don't start with me.
[01:06:08.504 --> 01:06:09.405]  I got all day.
[01:06:09.866 --> 01:06:11.487]  I'll take as much time as you want.
[01:06:11.787 --> 01:06:12.868]  So, let's go.
[01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:16.211]  You're not my boss.
[01:06:16.251 --> 01:06:17.112]  You're just a lawyer.
[01:06:17.132 --> 01:06:18.093]  Frivolous lawyer.
[01:06:18.673 --> 01:06:18.994]  So go.
[01:06:23.877 --> 01:06:24.898]  Don't start scolding me.
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.101]  I'm asking questions.
[01:06:28.161 --> 01:06:29.061]  I'm not going to scold you.
[01:06:29.502 --> 01:06:29.962]  Go ahead.
[01:06:30.943 --> 01:06:35.707]  Mike, I'm told they're trying to get sanctions against you now for not bowing down to this guy.
[01:06:36.857 --> 01:06:38.038]  Yeah, they're trying to.
[01:06:38.938 --> 01:06:52.304]  What he did is that on the last deposition, which was, I guess, about a month ago, maybe three weeks ago, at the last one, remember, I've been deposed by these same lawyers twice.
[01:06:52.724 --> 01:06:57.948]   Well, I went into this when I said, hey, you guys, I have a show today which was Steve Bannon's show.
[01:06:58.088 --> 01:07:13.101]  I do it every day and I said I told him ahead of time I had this show and I might have an emergency call coming in which was what we were doing at the banks cancelling us and other things that were the attacks that was going on at my billow that you all knew about about three weeks ago.
[01:07:13.522 --> 01:07:18.266]  Well I told him this and we ended up all of a sudden Bannon's show came up.
[01:07:18.306 --> 01:07:19.287]  Well they didn't like that.
[01:07:19.627 --> 01:07:26.042]   Well then it got to be into the afternoon And I got the call, the emergency call from the bank!
[01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:27.811]  I said, I gotta take it.
[01:07:27.831 --> 01:07:28.491]  There's the call.
[01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:30.293]  And the guy goes, you're not taking that.
[01:07:30.333 --> 01:07:31.213]  You need to sit down.
[01:07:31.654 --> 01:07:33.795]  And that's where I said, no, I'm taking this.
[01:07:34.075 --> 01:07:35.476]  You guys are part of the problem.
[01:07:35.496 --> 01:07:36.617]  This is even happening.
[01:07:37.177 --> 01:07:40.200]  And I went out in the hall, took the call, came back in.
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.141]  And then he goes, we're shutting this down.
[01:07:42.421 --> 01:07:44.303]  You're going to have to pay sanctions.
[01:07:44.343 --> 01:07:44.883]  We're going to go.
[01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:46.644]  We're going to bring this to the judge.
[01:07:46.704 --> 01:07:49.486]  And I'm going, ooh, I'm really afraid you're going to bring it to the judge.
[01:07:49.766 --> 01:07:51.187]  So I said, I'll sit here all night.
[01:07:51.227 --> 01:07:51.768]  I'll come back.
[01:07:52.688 --> 01:07:54.009]  And you want to do sanctions?
[01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:57.330]  I've been sanctioned so many times already, it's disgusting, Alec.
[01:07:57.630 --> 01:07:59.430]  You know, this is the world we're in right now.
[01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:01.071]  You guys, here's one.
[01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:18.236]  I actually went out and my lawyers got, we went out and got 12 Dominion machines from like four or five different states and we put in for those for discovery and we said we want to see them and go inside them.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:28.390]  Well, a judge in Michigan said no, and not only you shouldn't have even asked, we're going to sanction you $26,000 just for asking.
[01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:29.951]  Well, this is my case!
[01:08:30.652 --> 01:08:31.913]  And I couldn't believe it.
[01:08:31.933 --> 01:08:34.536]  Then we went to the federal judge in DC.
[01:08:34.776 --> 01:08:36.578]  He says, well, of course you can get those machines.
[01:08:37.341 --> 01:08:41.866]  Well, you think I can go back to that judge in Michigan and say I want my $26,000 back?
[01:08:42.246 --> 01:08:46.290]  Isn't it funny we've learned words like sanctions and no standing?
[01:08:46.611 --> 01:08:52.697]  It's funny how none of us have standing and we're getting sanctioned for just asking things that aren't part of our case.
[01:08:52.737 --> 01:08:53.658]  Let's expand on that.
[01:08:53.678 --> 01:08:54.439]  It's disgusting.
[01:08:55.346 --> 01:08:57.368]  The judges are going to let any of this in.
[01:08:57.388 --> 01:08:59.310]  They're going to default you claiming you didn't submit to them.
[01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:00.091]  That's what they're building.
[01:09:00.491 --> 01:09:03.434]  So they can then say, oh, you have a jury trial deciding how much money you owe.
[01:09:03.894 --> 01:09:04.675]  It's how they're doing it.
[01:09:04.695 --> 01:09:05.976]  The Supreme Court needs to act.
[01:09:06.397 --> 01:09:07.698]  This is their new attack program.
[01:09:07.718 --> 01:09:08.699]  They admitted about me.
[01:09:09.039 --> 01:09:10.040]  They admitted about everybody.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:10.941]  This is their plan.
[01:09:11.261 --> 01:09:12.603]  You're in the same jaws of this.
[01:09:13.123 --> 01:09:15.766]  But shifting gears, they're trying to distract you from what you're doing.
[01:09:16.206 --> 01:09:26.712]   Tomorrow, tomorrow and on Wednesday, I am going to be deposed, but we said fine, split it up in two days, so I can at least do the last few hours of my show.
[01:09:27.072 --> 01:09:29.354]  So Harrison Smith will be here tomorrow and the next day.
[01:09:29.534 --> 01:09:31.736]  But I'll be here after that, like noon every day.
[01:09:32.096 --> 01:09:33.777]  Same thing with Trump, with all these indictments.
[01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:36.339]  It's meant to tie him down during the election.
[01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:37.900]  That's why we're just going to work harder.
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:39.381]  People are going to figure it out.
[01:09:39.961 --> 01:09:42.965]  And yes, I know you also attacked him back in one clip.
[01:09:42.985 --> 01:09:44.387]  He says, oh, you're just making a bunch of money.
[01:09:44.767 --> 01:09:48.953]  We all know you were a huge superstar, incredibly successful till you stood up for America.
[01:09:49.313 --> 01:09:51.235]  Now you're on the verge of them being able to shut you down.
[01:09:51.556 --> 01:09:57.483]  But America can save my pillow and my store and plus get great products made in America and you're a sponsor of ours.
[01:09:58.044 --> 01:09:58.985]  Call to action.
[01:09:59.505 --> 01:10:00.886]  Let's flood Mike Lindell.
[01:10:00.926 --> 01:10:02.628]  This should go out, not just his show, but everywhere.
[01:10:02.888 --> 01:10:04.309]  Promo code Alex get a discount.
[01:10:04.670 --> 01:10:06.231]  MyPillow.com forward slash Alex.
[01:10:06.831 --> 01:10:07.992]  They don't want you to have funds.
[01:10:08.012 --> 01:10:08.933]  They want to shut you up.
[01:10:08.973 --> 01:10:10.074]  So enough about them.
[01:10:10.454 --> 01:10:11.515]  You're the man in the arena.
[01:10:11.575 --> 01:10:12.536]  People stand with you.
[01:10:12.896 --> 01:10:13.997]  They should get great products.
[01:10:14.037 --> 01:10:17.140]  Give us a rundown of the products and some of the big sales you got going right now.
[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:17.340]  Yeah.
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:17.880]  Right.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:21.921]  And I'm giving you four just for coming on your show right now, everybody.
[01:10:21.961 --> 01:10:24.841]  You can get the my pillow queen size sheets.
[01:10:24.881 --> 01:10:26.122]  We're closing out that line.
[01:10:26.442 --> 01:10:28.762]  Thirty five dollars for queen size.
[01:10:28.822 --> 01:10:29.702]  My pillow sheets.
[01:10:30.163 --> 01:10:32.103]  Thirty nine dollars for king size.
[01:10:32.563 --> 01:10:34.823]  And then we're doing the original my slippers.
[01:10:35.084 --> 01:10:37.404]  These are the ones were one hundred and I think thirty nine dollars.
[01:10:37.424 --> 01:10:38.984]  They're better than the other brand.
[01:10:39.024 --> 01:10:40.625]  I don't want to mention that brand out there.
[01:10:40.905 --> 01:10:42.325]  The best slippers in history.
[01:10:43.045 --> 01:10:47.486]  39.98.
[01:10:43.565 --> 01:10:47.486]  Then we have the MyPillow 2.0, the queen size.
[01:10:47.806 --> 01:10:50.227]  This is the first time we're putting them on sale today.
[01:10:50.267 --> 01:10:52.367]  You can buy an individual queen size.
[01:10:52.387 --> 01:10:52.367]  39.99.
[01:10:53.087 --> 01:10:57.648]  This is the MyPillow 2.0 with the new technology available here in the U.S.
[01:10:58.008 --> 01:11:00.229]  for cooling technology, this cooling thread.
[01:11:00.609 --> 01:11:03.449]  I made a fabric exclusively for MyPillow.
[01:11:03.729 --> 01:11:05.350]  Made that last year in my off time.
[01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:06.350]  We put it all together.
[01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:10.298]  Because sleep is about temperature and height.
[01:11:10.659 --> 01:11:13.606]  So you can adjust my pillow to get to your exact height.
[01:11:14.346 --> 01:11:16.867]  And then you get the right temperature.
[01:11:17.247 --> 01:11:19.048]  Then we have my towels.
[01:11:19.388 --> 01:11:21.749]  Those six-pack towel sets, everybody, are back.
[01:11:21.769 --> 01:11:21.749]  $39.99.
[01:11:22.169 --> 01:11:24.970]  Use that promo code, Alex.
[01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:27.371]  You guys have been the greatest support here on this show.
[01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:30.692]  And I'll tell you what, Alex, my employees are being attacked.
[01:11:30.772 --> 01:11:39.996]  If it wouldn't be for shows like yourself, with everybody buying their stuff, it builds their confidence that they're not going to lose their jobs, that they're going to still be able to go to work tomorrow.
[01:11:40.356 --> 01:11:41.536]  Some of them have been with me 20 years.
[01:11:43.237 --> 01:11:44.118]  We have careers.
[01:11:44.779 --> 01:11:45.660]  Let me interrupt you.
[01:11:47.942 --> 01:11:48.903]  That's all important.
[01:11:48.943 --> 01:11:55.330]  But I saw you, you know, six, seven years ago on air and ordered some sheets and towels and thought these are great and, man, they're low price.
[01:11:56.191 --> 01:11:57.753]  I reordered some about three months ago.
[01:11:58.934 --> 01:12:02.258]  One towel is like $25 at the store, a crappy one.
[01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:03.859]  These are huge stacks.
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:06.021]  I mean, I don't know how you do it.
[01:12:06.341 --> 01:12:09.343]  Quite frankly, you ought to actually charge more to get more funds in to fund yourself.
[01:12:09.363 --> 01:12:10.663]  You've been kicked out of all the stores.
[01:12:11.204 --> 01:12:15.906]  These are, I mean, queen-size sheets are like $100, crappy ones everywhere.
[01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:17.567]  You've got them for 30-something bucks.
[01:12:17.587 --> 01:12:18.327]  These are quality.
[01:12:18.847 --> 01:12:21.049]  These are great deals, and it keeps you on air.
[01:12:21.349 --> 01:12:22.269]  People want to stand up.
[01:12:22.309 --> 01:12:23.590]  We don't have George Soros money, folks.
[01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:24.250]  We've got you.
[01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:32.875]  Everyone, unless you want to help the globalists shut down your right to vote, should go immediately to MyPillow.com forward slash Alex right now.
[01:12:32.935 --> 01:12:33.315]  Keep going.
[01:12:34.508 --> 01:12:34.989]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:35.069 --> 01:12:39.333]  And you guys in those set, those towels, you got to realize, I'm going to just explain the towels.
[01:12:39.573 --> 01:12:40.894]  That's a six piece set.
[01:12:41.375 --> 01:12:49.182]  And those towels, like Alex said, one towel in a target or whatever would be thirty some dollars or thirty dollars.
[01:12:49.262 --> 01:12:50.784]  And these towels aren't just towels.
[01:12:51.244 --> 01:12:52.585]  I reverse-engineered them.
[01:12:52.905 --> 01:12:58.146]  You know, you go into a store and you feel, oh, they feel all lotion-y and soft, and then you get them home and they don't work.
[01:12:58.526 --> 01:13:00.467]  This is a commercial idea with these towels.
[01:13:00.527 --> 01:13:06.229]  I said, you could line a swimming pool with the towels that are in the stores, and our towels absorb.
[01:13:06.269 --> 01:13:06.749]  They work.
[01:13:07.029 --> 01:13:10.010]  They're actually soft, but they actually dry you off.
[01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:19.438]  And so, when I make a product or invent a product or improve on a product, I reverse engineer and say, how is it going to help each and every one of you out there?
[01:13:19.939 --> 01:13:22.341]  And that's what we've done with the towels, with the sheets.
[01:13:22.601 --> 01:13:25.704]  That's why people say, wow, you know, I'm buying my pillow.
[01:13:25.744 --> 01:13:27.325]  This weekend was really amazing.
[01:13:27.586 --> 01:13:36.614]  With me, the depositions going out everywhere in the country, people that had never bought my pillow before became supportive and bought the stuff and going, wow, this is amazing.
[01:13:37.014 --> 01:13:42.218]  Or people say, I bought some the other day, I didn't realize that I'm doing it to support Mike and MyPillow.
[01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:44.299]  But these products actually work!
[01:13:44.799 --> 01:13:45.540]  They're the best pill.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:49.062]  People were responding when they made the comment about lumpy pillows.
[01:13:49.282 --> 01:13:53.665]  We've sold over 80 million MyPillows in 20 years.
[01:13:54.186 --> 01:13:54.766]  They work.
[01:13:54.826 --> 01:13:57.148]  They help you get the best sleep of your life.
[01:13:57.448 --> 01:13:59.429]  And now we've improved on them, the MyPillow 2.0.
[01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:04.411]  Use that promo code, Alex, and you get the MyPillow 2.0.
[01:14:05.051 --> 01:14:08.933]  And you've got to go to MyPillow.com backslash Alex.
[01:14:09.293 --> 01:14:14.374]  That special's right there, where you can only get it there, where you get the MyPillow 2.0.
[01:14:14.714 --> 01:14:15.755]  The queen size for $39.99.

[01:14:16.575 --> 01:14:24.217]  Say it slow, because a lot of people are driving down the highway, or they're listening on AM radio, or however, they need to write this down.
[01:14:24.257 --> 01:14:25.638]  How do they get that even bigger sale?
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.442]  Yeah, you need to get the bigger sale.
[01:14:29.502 --> 01:14:32.884]  This is MyPillow.com backslash Alex.
[01:14:33.464 --> 01:14:39.928]  Or if you're calling into MyPillow, make sure you tell them Alex the promo code and you tell them that promo code everybody.
[01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:43.270]  These are exclusive specials that we just put up today.
[01:14:43.571 --> 01:14:47.753]  You're getting extra exclusive sales right now.
[01:14:48.133 --> 01:14:51.135]  So there's the MyPillow 2.0.
[01:14:52.015 --> 01:14:58.934]   If you guys, if you go to, and then you have the original MySlippers, those guys, you guys,
[01:14:58.934 --> 01:15:01.215]  these were a hundred and some dollars.
[01:15:01.215 --> 01:15:06.215]   There's the buy one, get one free, but you can get the individual MyPillow on there for
[01:15:06.215 --> 01:15:07.215]  that price.
[01:15:07.215 --> 01:15:08.894]  All right, Mike, we've got two minutes left.
[01:15:08.894 --> 01:15:09.894]  I know you've got two minutes left.
[01:15:09.894 --> 01:15:13.175]  I appreciate you, but just don't be upset.
[01:15:13.190 --> 01:15:15.332]  I mean, I didn't know it boosted your sales, but I thought it would.
[01:15:15.713 --> 01:15:17.554]  Don't be upset that they got you hot on the collar.
[01:15:17.574 --> 01:15:18.295]  They think they're winning.
[01:15:18.335 --> 01:15:19.016]  They're going to lose.
[01:15:19.456 --> 01:15:20.757]  Because it's not just Mike Lindell.
[01:15:20.797 --> 01:15:21.798]  It's not just Donald Trump.
[01:15:22.239 --> 01:15:24.121]  It's not just Alex Jones or Tucker Carlson.
[01:15:24.581 --> 01:15:26.283]  More and more people are Jack LeSobick.
[01:15:26.703 --> 01:15:28.124]  People are really waking up.
[01:15:28.184 --> 01:15:29.426]  We see that in closing.
[01:15:29.786 --> 01:15:32.028]  You've got a lot of great stuff and initiatives going on.
[01:15:32.048 --> 01:15:32.709]  What else are you up to?
[01:15:33.817 --> 01:15:35.477]  Well, I want to quick tell you two one more thing.
[01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:40.518]  We extended the labor state sale too for the, for your MyPillow.com backstage.
[01:15:40.618 --> 01:15:42.159]  Alex, you can get our beds.
[01:15:42.479 --> 01:15:43.999]  We make them all here in the U.S.
[01:15:44.259 --> 01:15:46.160]  The best beds you'll ever sleep on.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.200]  So if you're looking for a bed, that's where you need to go.
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:16:01.563]  The other stuff we're on, Alex, while I'm fighting back with these Coomer guys, what I'm doing is we're doing, we did a summary judgment, everybody, on Friday to get rid of these lawsuits, to get rid of it.
[01:16:02.043 --> 01:16:05.325]  Now whether that judge after it, you know, who knows what she's gonna do.
[01:16:05.625 --> 01:16:14.689]  But a summary judgment we filed to get rid of this lawsuit, once and for all these frivolous lawsuits, so we can concentrate on securing our election.
[01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:38.811]   Which by the way everybody, if you go get the Frank Social app, that's my new election app, Frank Social, name like the name Frank, Frank Social, go get that app at the App Store, and all the stuff we're doing right now, We have, just in the last month, we have another 11 counties in this country committed to go to paper ballots, hand counting, and get rid of these electronic computers in our elections.
[01:16:39.491 --> 01:16:40.692]  Great things are happening.
[01:16:41.052 --> 01:16:50.757]  Tomorrow, everybody, tomorrow, the case that we had in Arizona to get rid of the machines there with Kerry Lake and Mark Fincham, we're appealing that tomorrow.
[01:16:50.797 --> 01:16:54.739]  It's going to be live streamed on my platform, Frank's Beach, and Lyndale TV.
[01:16:54.799 --> 01:16:57.001]  It'll be live streamed tomorrow right from the courthouse.
[01:16:57.281 --> 01:16:58.621]  We're going to win this, everybody.
[01:16:58.661 --> 01:17:04.985]  And if we don't, there with that Supreme Court there, the Arizona Ninth Circuit, we're going all the way to the Supreme Court.
[01:17:05.345 --> 01:17:08.786]  We are going to secure our election platforms.
[01:17:09.086 --> 01:17:14.008]  We have a great plan for this fall.
[01:17:14.909 --> 01:17:18.950]  In Arizona, you guys just had a big victory where the judge agreed that the election wasn't run right.
[01:17:20.081 --> 01:17:20.701]  Absolutely.
[01:17:21.201 --> 01:17:25.402]  We're getting victories every day, and that was a big victory there.
[01:17:25.722 --> 01:17:33.944]  If you guys want to know about this, just get that Frank Social app at the App Store, and you can learn about your state.
[01:17:33.964 --> 01:17:37.365]  We just won another one up in Michigan, another one in Wisconsin.
[01:17:37.605 --> 01:17:39.085]  We're getting wins all over the place.
[01:17:39.105 --> 01:17:43.366]  You're not going to hear about these wins on Fox News and Newsmax and Celeb Media.
[01:17:43.386 --> 01:17:43.906]  No, you're not.
[01:17:43.966 --> 01:17:44.886]  Thank you so much.
[01:17:45.707 --> 01:17:47.087]  MyPillow.com forward slash Alex.
[01:17:47.907 --> 01:17:49.170]  You want people to fight tyranny?
[01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:50.032]  Well, we're doing it.
[01:17:50.573 --> 01:17:51.555]  But you gotta back us.
[01:17:52.538 --> 01:17:53.319]  We're turning the tide.
[01:17:55.196 --> 01:17:55.796]  We need your help.
[01:17:56.637 --> 01:17:58.918]  I said objection, not unresponsive.
[01:17:58.978 --> 01:18:01.180]  Let me explain a few more things to you.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:01.740]  What?
[01:18:02.461 --> 01:18:04.322]  Let me explain a few more things to you.
[01:18:04.862 --> 01:18:07.144]  Have you given a deposition before like this?
[01:18:07.184 --> 01:18:08.725]  I've given a ton of depositions.
[01:18:09.005 --> 01:18:12.247]  Okay, so you understand the process somewhat.
[01:18:12.447 --> 01:18:12.847]  Sure do.
[01:18:13.347 --> 01:18:13.528]  Okay.
[01:18:14.428 --> 01:18:19.371]  When I ask you a question, you need to do your best to respond only to my question.
[01:18:19.391 --> 01:18:20.092]  Are you going to arrest me?
[01:18:21.519 --> 01:18:24.241]  I'll say whatever I want, and if we have extra, that's too bad.
[01:18:24.481 --> 01:18:26.562]  There's no rule that says I can't give a full answer.
[01:18:27.923 --> 01:18:28.883]  I'm telling you the rules.
[01:18:28.923 --> 01:18:31.645]  Have you ever been in a deposition where they can't stand who you are?
[01:18:31.665 --> 01:18:33.446]  Have you?
[01:18:33.466 --> 01:18:34.866]  A lot more than you, sir.
[01:18:34.886 --> 01:18:35.347]  Okay, good.
[01:18:35.787 --> 01:18:36.247]  Keep going.
[01:18:37.088 --> 01:18:38.749]  Don't tell me about my depositions.
[01:18:38.769 --> 01:18:43.951]  You're not my boss, you're just some frivolous lawyer in here, and you're bringing this frivolous case to me.
[01:18:44.452 --> 01:18:47.733]  And especially against a company that had nothing to do with anything.
[01:18:47.994 --> 01:18:48.914]  You're disgusting.
[01:18:49.675 --> 01:18:50.115]  Keep going.
[01:18:51.787 --> 01:18:53.448]  I want you to understand another thing.
[01:18:53.848 --> 01:18:54.329]  What's that?
[01:18:55.349 --> 01:18:57.390]  This case is pending in federal court in Colorado.
[01:18:57.410 --> 01:18:57.830]  I don't care.
[01:18:58.311 --> 01:18:59.651]  What does that have to do with anything?
[01:18:59.851 --> 01:19:00.852]  Do you understand that?
[01:19:01.452 --> 01:19:01.913]  Yes.
[01:19:02.353 --> 01:19:03.754]  Alright.
[01:19:03.814 --> 01:19:08.376]  There's a federal judge that's going to likely be reading and watching this deposition.
[01:19:08.556 --> 01:19:08.816]  I don't care.
[01:19:08.836 --> 01:19:09.577]  Do you understand that?
[01:19:09.717 --> 01:19:10.257]  I don't care.
[01:19:10.817 --> 01:19:12.798]  She should have dismissed this a long time ago.
[01:19:13.639 --> 01:19:15.060]  She hasn't ruled on that.
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:16.781]  I've got a problem with her too.
[01:19:17.941 --> 01:19:23.584]   The judge has practice standards on how No, the judge did not dismiss this case.
[01:19:23.624 --> 01:19:32.446]  We put in to get it dismissed and she ruled, an unfair ruling, saying, well go ahead and do discovery and waste all your time while I'm sitting there not doing nothing.
[01:19:32.706 --> 01:19:34.107]  That's what that judge is doing.
[01:19:34.807 --> 01:19:39.028]  So don't tell me what the judge is doing and you just let me worry about the judge reading this, okay?
[01:19:39.968 --> 01:19:41.569]  I just want you to understand that.
[01:19:41.929 --> 01:19:43.329]  No, you just don't worry about me.
[01:19:43.349 --> 01:19:45.050]  You're not out for my benefit, okay?
[01:19:46.348 --> 01:19:46.689]  All right.
[01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:49.032]  Michael Dell's our guest for a few more minutes.
[01:19:49.053 --> 01:19:55.383]  We have Ririque Atario and other victims of the police state scheduled to call in from prison next segment.
[01:19:55.443 --> 01:19:57.526]  But this is the tyranny we're witnessing.
[01:19:58.703 --> 01:20:03.786]  He does an anti-slap file, I did it to me, the judge says we're not going to see that, the case goes on.
[01:20:04.226 --> 01:20:06.787]  Then they default you claiming you don't give them the information.
[01:20:07.087 --> 01:20:10.589]  Then they use the twisted information in front of a jury where you're already guilty.
[01:20:10.989 --> 01:20:11.730]  That's their plan.
[01:20:11.770 --> 01:20:12.790]  They want to intimidate us.
[01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:14.431]  This is their operation.
[01:20:14.471 --> 01:20:24.116]  So, talking closing, because during the break I was saying body, and you said, yeah, it's all CIA, Washington Post, which we know the CIA is running the Washington Post, and Jeff Bezos.
[01:20:25.076 --> 01:20:29.279]  So talk about that, but also, I see the victories in Arizona and other states.
[01:20:30.519 --> 01:20:31.700]  Nobody talks about those.
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.041]  They control corporate media.
[01:20:33.061 --> 01:20:36.062]  So finish up, please, here from MyPillow.com.
[01:20:36.903 --> 01:20:38.103]  Mike Lindell.
[01:20:39.724 --> 01:20:43.566]  When I talk about the CIA, I'm well-versed in them now, everybody.
[01:20:43.586 --> 01:20:53.512]  When I had the cyber symposium in Sioux Falls, South Dakota in the summer of 21, when I had that, there were so many people involved with the CIA there.
[01:20:54.572 --> 01:20:59.856]  My witness that I have, my information comes from Dennis Montgomery, who worked with the CIA.
[01:21:00.136 --> 01:21:01.517]  So we're very well versed in that.
[01:21:02.097 --> 01:21:08.181]  Then, the Washington Post leaked stuff back then, all over the place, when I got physically attacked.
[01:21:08.441 --> 01:21:12.123]  It was in the Washington Post saying, Mike Lindell did not get attacked.
[01:21:12.163 --> 01:21:14.245]  He's lying, he didn't get attacked.
[01:21:14.285 --> 01:21:15.245]  Read the police report.
[01:21:15.465 --> 01:21:18.367]  We got the guy's picture all over the news, but they never did anything.
[01:21:19.728 --> 01:21:24.190]  Then, I go to do another deposition, and they leak that.
[01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:25.670]  The Washington Post leaks that.
[01:21:26.071 --> 01:21:35.174]  Then we do the $5 million challenge where they corruptly, there's a whole thing that's going to come out about that, everybody, that's still in court, by the way, that $5 million challenge.
[01:21:35.594 --> 01:21:37.175]  Mike Lindell loses $5 million.
[01:21:37.475 --> 01:21:39.176]  It doesn't even go to court until the end of 2024.
[01:21:40.156 --> 01:21:42.957]  They want to push everything out.
[01:21:43.017 --> 01:21:49.300]  The CIA is directly, I believe, involved with all this, and it starts with the Washington crooked Post.
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.181]  The Washington Post is behind it.
[01:21:51.461 --> 01:22:06.568]  How can they release all my deposition and they soundbit me, and this is all a plan they have, but remember, Alex, evil is greedy, and they're very greedy, and what they're used to doing, well, we could do this and it's going to destroy Mike Lindell, but it hasn't.
[01:22:06.868 --> 01:22:14.491]  We've got God on our side, and I'll tell you what, my faith is a lot bigger than anything CIA and all that other garbage that's going on.
[01:22:14.532 --> 01:22:15.152]  No, absolutely.
[01:22:15.172 --> 01:22:16.592]  They got to bully or intimidate us.
[01:22:17.893 --> 01:22:22.177]  It was the CIA or the Washington Post that took down Nixon when he didn't want to sell out to them.
[01:22:22.217 --> 01:22:23.678]  So yeah, we're up against the bad guys.
[01:22:23.838 --> 01:22:24.098]  Go ahead.
[01:22:24.398 --> 01:22:25.019]  Absolutely.
[01:22:25.059 --> 01:22:26.760]  We're up against horrible, horrible guys.
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:27.901]  And it goes so deep.
[01:22:28.242 --> 01:22:29.583]  And everyone can say, oh, come on, Mike.
[01:22:29.603 --> 01:22:31.785]  The CIA, I 100% know this.
[01:22:32.345 --> 01:22:34.267]  That was in the weaponization hearings.
[01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:39.499]  The CIA runs the whole thing with big tech to censor when you question elections.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:41.180]  Right, absolutely.
[01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:42.581]  Well, I want to tell everybody something.
[01:22:42.801 --> 01:22:45.363]  Do you know the evidence I had originally, Alex?
[01:22:45.763 --> 01:22:56.309]  Originally, the CIA approached my family members and other people saying, the evidence you have, and they used Dennis Montgomery's name, you have Dennis Montgomery's evidence.
[01:22:56.409 --> 01:22:57.029]  It's no good.
[01:22:57.109 --> 01:22:57.570]  It's no good.
[01:22:57.810 --> 01:22:58.550]  He's a con man.
[01:22:58.870 --> 01:23:01.572]  I'm going, whoever said that, I never mentioned Dennis Montgomery.
[01:23:02.092 --> 01:23:10.279]  Well, Dennis Montgomery worked for you guys, and now you're threatening or telling my family that I should give up and not even bring the evidence forth.
[01:23:10.659 --> 01:23:13.581]  I mean, so they're almost telling on themselves back then.
[01:23:13.681 --> 01:23:14.482]  It's disgusting.
[01:23:14.822 --> 01:23:19.966]  But what they're doing now, linking this stuff to the public, it backfired on them.
[01:23:20.307 --> 01:23:21.348]  It backfired on them.
[01:23:21.568 --> 01:23:23.990]  They go, oh, we're going to show Mike Lindell.
[01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:25.131]  He's really upset.
[01:23:25.411 --> 01:23:27.392]  I'm sure every person gets upset out there.
[01:23:27.673 --> 01:23:29.174]  I'm not going to change who I am.
[01:23:29.514 --> 01:23:32.418]  You know, maybe I went a little too far in that deposition.
[01:23:32.978 --> 01:23:36.542]  No, they act like it's bad when we get bad because they're scared of us getting mad.
[01:23:37.103 --> 01:23:38.945]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:39.226 --> 01:23:47.075]  But I'll tell you what, I've had so much support and you have all supported me out there in my company and we thank each and every one of you.
[01:23:47.535 --> 01:23:59.602]  And you can do that by continuing to buy our products, because I'll tell you what, I have employees that used to be afraid, and now because of all of you, over the last two and a half years we've been attacked.
[01:23:59.642 --> 01:24:03.625]  For them, it's just a comforting confidence that people are still buying.
[01:24:03.645 --> 01:24:08.568]  Same thing with my crew, same thing with the Boers, that's why we're two peas in a pod.
[01:24:08.848 --> 01:24:11.990]  Talk about some of the victories that we don't see in the controlled corporate press in closing.
[01:24:12.771 --> 01:24:17.495]  Yeah, what you all need to know, there's victories in so many of these states.
[01:24:17.535 --> 01:24:20.097]  Remember, we have a plan to secure our elections.
[01:24:20.377 --> 01:24:22.719]  You can go check out the plan at Frank Social.
[01:24:22.739 --> 01:24:23.900]  Get the app, Frank Social.
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:28.864]  Just this week in Arkansas, we just won some huge things in Arkansas.
[01:24:28.884 --> 01:24:31.606]  Two more counties going to pay for ballots.
[01:24:32.267 --> 01:24:33.868]  Eighteen of them in California.
[01:24:33.908 --> 01:24:38.292]  But I saw where in Arizona, they just ruled for Cary Lake that the ballots weren't done right.
[01:24:38.972 --> 01:24:40.073]  A hundred percent.
[01:24:40.154 --> 01:24:42.696]  Carrie Lake's got big, we got big things going on there.
[01:24:42.976 --> 01:24:50.243]  Tomorrow everybody, you're gonna see we finally got the case here to get rid of the machines before the Ninth Circuit in Arizona.
[01:24:50.564 --> 01:24:55.228]  And my lawyers, they really believe that we can get this all the way to the Supreme Court.
[01:24:55.488 --> 01:24:57.190]  The dominoes are gonna start falling.
[01:24:57.210 --> 01:24:59.953]  You guys, you guys, there's so much hope out there.
[01:25:00.013 --> 01:25:01.194]  I can't tell you enough.
[01:25:01.994 --> 01:25:11.457]  You should all, if you want to find some hope, quit watching Fox News and stuff and watch shows like your show, Alec, because people need to hear the hope that's going on.
[01:25:11.637 --> 01:25:23.540]  People are getting, you take what's going on right now in our country with them open borders and the fentanyl pouring in and people end up feeling hopeless and they turn to drugs or they magnify, it gets magnified and their kids are dying.
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:24.840]  It's disgusting.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:26.161]  People need to hear the hope.
[01:25:26.481 --> 01:25:27.821]  And I'm going to tell you something right there.
[01:25:27.861 --> 01:25:30.102]  Go to the LyndaleRecoveryNetwork.org.
[01:25:30.422 --> 01:25:32.582]  If you have anybody in addiction, it's free.
[01:25:32.942 --> 01:25:34.143]  I used to be a crack addict.
[01:25:34.183 --> 01:25:35.223]  I used to be addicted.
[01:25:35.543 --> 01:25:37.003]  Now you could all go there.
[01:25:37.383 --> 01:25:39.784]  It's free to anybody that's got any addiction.
[01:25:41.064 --> 01:25:42.725]  LyndaleRecoveryNetwork.org.
[01:25:42.845 --> 01:25:44.685]  You can go there and get help.
[01:25:44.785 --> 01:25:49.928]   In closing, the enemy doesn't get why Trump It's more popular as they try to put him in jail.
[01:25:50.408 --> 01:25:56.312]  Or when they leaked all this cherry pick stuff, you getting mad on three depositions and it makes you get bigger sales.
[01:25:56.352 --> 01:25:58.573]  They just don't get, they just don't get it.
[01:25:59.114 --> 01:26:00.795]  And so the numbers show they're in deep trouble.
[01:26:01.539 --> 01:26:02.200]  Yeah, they are.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:13.411]  And they, like I say, any other time in history, I said, I talked to our real president the other day and I told him this, you know, any other time in history, these kind of attacks probably would have worked back then.
[01:26:13.711 --> 01:26:18.876]  But what's happened over the last two or three years is everybody now, we see through those lies.
[01:26:19.136 --> 01:26:20.377]  We see through the media.
[01:26:20.798 --> 01:26:22.860]  Everybody knows what the truth is.
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:24.301]  Everybody knows.
[01:26:24.321 --> 01:26:31.105]  You can talk to anyone on the street, and they know that the media out there, they had the media, but you know what?
[01:26:31.945 --> 01:26:33.186]  It's backfired on them.
[01:26:33.206 --> 01:26:34.067]  Everything they do.
[01:26:34.347 --> 01:26:41.031]  When you indict a great real president for the fourth time, every time they indict him, he goes up more in the polls.
[01:26:41.111 --> 01:26:41.631]  And you know what?
[01:26:41.992 --> 01:26:52.444]   I said once to the media, I said, you know, They keep indicting him, and I said he's gonna pretty soon have more votes than there are people in this country, like Pennsylvania did in the last election.
[01:26:52.924 --> 01:26:56.228]  And I said it in sarcasm, and then of course the media comes out.
[01:26:56.509 --> 01:26:58.351]  Mike Lindell's gonna cheat for Donald Trump.
[01:26:58.611 --> 01:27:00.474]  He's gonna get more votes than there are voters.
[01:27:01.135 --> 01:27:03.836]  But, you know, people are onto it.
[01:27:04.036 --> 01:27:05.376]  Evil overplayed its hand.
[01:27:05.556 --> 01:27:06.517]  Evil is greedy.
[01:27:06.837 --> 01:27:12.218]  They've overplayed their hand going all the way back to, for a long time, and all the way back to 2020.
[01:27:12.298 --> 01:27:13.619]  Great job, Mike Lindell.
[01:27:13.679 --> 01:27:14.179]  Thank you.
[01:27:14.199 --> 01:27:24.822]  You know, I'm proud of my family name, Jones, but I've got some other family names, like Grisham, my direct ancestor, founder of the first stock exchange 400-something years ago in England.
[01:27:26.101 --> 01:27:29.242]  But this governor, New Mexico governor, makes me ashamed of the name Grisham.
[01:27:30.062 --> 01:27:39.044]  Governor Michelle Grisham came out and said, we're banning you having your guns, even though you have a lawful state permit or you're legally carrying.
[01:27:39.464 --> 01:27:40.984]  She's declared a health emergency.
[01:27:42.504 --> 01:27:52.206]  They cut the police, they allow crime to run free, the DAs that are sorority patrol let the prisoners out, the violent criminals, and they say it's your fault we're taking your guns.
[01:27:52.266 --> 01:27:54.147]  That's why they're collapsing society.
[01:27:55.145 --> 01:28:01.651]  But folks are protesting in mass out there, openly carrying, saying we're not complying with your illegal order.
[01:28:02.191 --> 01:28:04.273]  Now there's impeachment beginning of the governor.
[01:28:04.293 --> 01:28:12.980]  But make no mistake, this is being done as a beta test for other, quote, health emergencies to take the guns.
[01:28:14.842 --> 01:28:16.543]  During the next lockdown, they're rolling out.
[01:28:17.024 --> 01:28:20.767]  I'll bet you my bottom dollar, the Justice Department, the State Department told her to do this.
[01:28:22.435 --> 01:28:25.997]  Let's play a few minutes of her press conference that's gone ultra-viral.
[01:28:26.377 --> 01:28:28.939]  She says, oh, you're First Amendment, Second Amendment, that's not absolute.
[01:28:29.979 --> 01:28:33.541]  And then she says stuff like, oh, semi-automatic guns are legal on the streets.
[01:28:33.561 --> 01:28:35.422]  I mean, fully automatic guns are legal on the streets.
[01:28:36.142 --> 01:28:48.923]   It's like Biden saying, you know, the AR-15 fires bigger bullets out, and you put a stock on a 9mm and it fires bigger bullets.
[01:28:49.023 --> 01:28:51.646]  I mean, it's just next level idiocy.
[01:28:51.686 --> 01:28:53.108]  But these are just the globalist puppets.
[01:28:53.148 --> 01:28:54.148]  Here she is.
[01:28:54.148 --> 01:28:54.148]  All the examples you cited are crimes.
[01:28:55.148 --> 01:28:56.148]  I'm going to ask you to repeat the question.
[01:28:56.148 --> 01:28:57.148]  I'm going to ask you to repeat the question.
[01:28:57.148 --> 01:28:58.148]  I'm going to ask you to repeat the question.
[01:28:58.148 --> 01:28:59.148]  I'm going to ask you to repeat the question.
[01:28:59.148 --> 01:29:00.148]  I'm going to ask you to repeat the question.
[01:29:00.148 --> 01:29:01.148]  I'm going to ask you to repeat the question.
[01:29:01.148 --> 01:29:02.148]  I'm going to ask you to repeat the question.
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:03.782]  Kids shooting at other kids.
[01:29:04.784 --> 01:29:05.845]  Shooting from cars.
[01:29:06.205 --> 01:29:08.247]  So what's the value of the civil order?
[01:29:08.567 --> 01:29:10.668]  Why not just do better law enforcement?
[01:29:11.129 --> 01:29:11.469]  Both.
[01:29:11.749 --> 01:29:15.732]  The value of the order is that it gives me three things.
[01:29:16.192 --> 01:29:19.935]  One, it says it's a statewide issue and it's a message to everyone.
[01:29:19.955 --> 01:29:20.675]  Start over in a minute.
[01:29:20.715 --> 01:29:21.196]  Back up, back up.
[01:29:21.236 --> 01:29:22.297]  I'm gonna have to stop and start this.
[01:29:24.258 --> 01:29:26.059]  Take the guns from law-abiding citizens.
[01:29:26.079 --> 01:29:26.840]  That'll stop crime.
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:28.321]  The criminals don't follow the law.
[01:29:28.361 --> 01:29:29.021]  We already know that.
[01:29:30.603 --> 01:29:32.284]  So again, think about what she's saying.
[01:29:32.344 --> 01:29:33.365]  Think about what she's doing.
[01:29:33.405 --> 01:29:33.785]  Continue.
[01:29:34.946 --> 01:29:35.126]  Yes.
[01:29:36.166 --> 01:29:38.848]  All the examples you cited are crimes.
[01:29:39.268 --> 01:29:42.709]  Kids shooting other kids, shooting from cars.
[01:29:43.069 --> 01:29:45.050]  So what's the value of the civil order?
[01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:47.551]  Why not just do better law enforcement?
[01:29:48.011 --> 01:29:48.331]  Both.
[01:29:48.631 --> 01:29:52.633]  The value of the order is that it gives me three things.
[01:29:53.053 --> 01:29:59.916]  One, it says it's a statewide issue and it's a message to everyone to start leveraging their resources and arresting people.
[01:30:00.496 --> 01:30:09.502]  Two, the jurisdictions come at this, including with the DOJ restrictions, differently, without the leveraging of the additional resources, arresting, and where do they go?
[01:30:09.522 --> 01:30:12.163]  We've got to make sure that everyone is bumping up their services.
[01:30:12.483 --> 01:30:15.565]  It's a message to the Metropolitan Detention Center.
[01:30:15.605 --> 01:30:16.966]  It's a message to the HMOs.
[01:30:17.827 --> 01:30:21.709]  Now what she's saying is, if you have a legal gun, period, under state law, we're going to arrest you.
[01:30:22.169 --> 01:30:28.265]   Well that means the criminals have a free-for-all, like all the other Bloots, areas, states, and cities that have disarmed.
[01:30:29.065 --> 01:30:30.646]  And so she's giving a green light to criminals.
[01:30:30.686 --> 01:30:31.046]  Continue.
[01:30:31.066 --> 01:30:32.667]  Arresting, and where do they go?
[01:30:32.687 --> 01:30:35.329]  We've got to make sure that everyone is bumping up their services.
[01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:38.751]  It's a message to the Metropolitan Detention Center.
[01:30:38.771 --> 01:30:40.151]  It's a message to the HMOs.
[01:30:40.392 --> 01:30:41.612]  You better figure out treatment.
[01:30:41.992 --> 01:30:45.394]  We have been sort of stalled out, to your point.
[01:30:45.755 --> 01:30:50.918]  This order basically says, stop stalling out, and to your point, just arrest everyone.
[01:30:51.898 --> 01:30:56.059]  Well, I also have to have the ability... I can't arrest everyone.
[01:30:56.099 --> 01:30:58.220]  There are literally too many people to arrest.
[01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:06.703]  This would allow us... If someone's got a concealed carriage for men and elk or people walking down a public street, they're not going to get arrested.
[01:31:07.883 --> 01:31:10.984]  I can make the point that maybe they should be.
[01:31:11.644 --> 01:31:12.725]  And this is the point.
[01:31:13.385 --> 01:31:16.186]  I'm willing to do anything and everything... Pause again.
[01:31:16.586 --> 01:31:16.886]  ...within...
[01:31:17.850 --> 01:31:19.131]  I'm gonna do anything and everything.
[01:31:19.691 --> 01:31:23.473]  So it's legal for people to have guns, but she's saying I'm gonna make the point and arrest you.
[01:31:24.594 --> 01:31:26.175]  To make the point that she's a dictator.
[01:31:26.215 --> 01:31:26.615]  Continue.
[01:31:27.115 --> 01:31:29.657]  A shred of evidence-based effort.
[01:31:30.818 --> 01:31:52.646]   Because if you're not horrified that on any street corner in too many cities in New Mexico there is someone with a gun sticking out of their waist or their belt And I'll tell you, if you're a young person, you're not allowed to have a handgun.
[01:31:52.946 --> 01:31:53.986]  Well, it's a crime already.
[01:31:54.066 --> 01:31:54.507]  I got it.
[01:31:54.727 --> 01:31:56.928]  But we won't be able to arrest all of them.
[01:31:57.268 --> 01:32:01.411]  So imagine, just in a perfect world... Pause again.
[01:32:02.511 --> 01:32:06.774]  Oh, we're not just going to go over to somebody who looks like they're 16 with a gun illegally and arrest them.
[01:32:07.274 --> 01:32:12.977]  We're going to treat everybody like criminals because we can't arrest them all, so we're going to arrest a bigger group of all the legal people.
[01:32:13.457 --> 01:32:14.478]  That's oxymoronic.
[01:32:15.984 --> 01:32:17.105]  You know who the gangbangers are.
[01:32:17.145 --> 01:32:17.986]  You know who's underage.
[01:32:18.006 --> 01:32:18.486]  No, no, no.
[01:32:19.026 --> 01:32:28.033]  You're all guilty because they've defunded police and the Soros DAs in New Mexico, they've taken the state, are letting criminals out on record just like everywhere else.
[01:32:29.294 --> 01:32:30.535]  They know damn well what they're doing.
[01:32:30.555 --> 01:32:31.796]  She thinks the public's too stupid.
[01:32:32.116 --> 01:32:32.516]  Continue.
[01:32:35.258 --> 01:32:40.743]  It gives all of these police officers the ability to focus on the real criminals.
[01:32:41.636 --> 01:32:43.116]  Last follow-up.
[01:32:43.136 --> 01:32:44.377]  But your point is valid.
[01:32:44.537 --> 01:32:46.337]  You took an oath to the Constitution.
[01:32:46.417 --> 01:32:51.939]  Isn't it unconstitutional to say you cannot exercise your carry license?
[01:32:52.519 --> 01:32:53.480]  With one exception.
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:33:03.383]  And that is, if there's an emergency, and I've declared an emergency for a temporary amount of time, I can invoke additional powers.
[01:33:03.863 --> 01:33:10.226]   No constitutional right, in my view, including my oath, Is intended to be absolute.
[01:33:10.666 --> 01:33:12.248]  There are restrictions on free speech.
[01:33:12.308 --> 01:33:14.049]  There are restrictions on my freedoms.
[01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:30.345]  In this emergency, this 11 year old and all these parents who have lost all these children, they deserve my attention to have the debate about whether or not in an emergency we can create a safer environment.
[01:33:32.086 --> 01:33:34.429]  So they're putting us into a permanent emergency.
[01:33:34.489 --> 01:33:35.730]  New lockdowns they're trying to push.
[01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:37.712]  She says it's a medical emergency.
[01:33:38.273 --> 01:33:43.438]  The UN says taking guns is a medical emergency in the treaty they're trying to get us to ratify, but we didn't.
[01:33:43.998 --> 01:33:44.779]  See how this works?
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.341]  Oh, it's an emergency.
[01:33:46.681 --> 01:33:47.101]  Continue.
[01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:48.683]  Constitutional rights.
[01:33:49.103 --> 01:33:51.486]  I took an oath to uphold those two.
[01:33:51.906 --> 01:34:01.635]  And if we ignore this growing problem without being bold, I've said to every other New Mexican, your rights are subjugated to theirs.
[01:34:02.336 --> 01:34:03.897]  And they are not, in my view.
[01:34:03.917 --> 01:34:05.298]  You're talking about crimes.
[01:34:05.358 --> 01:34:10.703]  There are already laws against the crimes, so how are their rights subjugated?
[01:34:10.843 --> 01:34:17.033]   But again, if I'm unsafe, Who's standing up for that right?
[01:34:18.153 --> 01:34:23.136]  If this climate is so out of control, somebody should do something.
[01:34:24.016 --> 01:34:26.037]  I'm doing as much as I know to do.
[01:34:26.077 --> 01:34:35.582]  Do you really think that criminals are going to hear this message and not carry a gun in Albuquerque on the streets for 30 days?
[01:34:36.923 --> 01:34:37.123]  No.
[01:34:38.444 --> 01:34:39.485]  But here's what I do think.
[01:34:40.225 --> 01:34:41.706]  It's a pretty resounding message.
[01:34:44.710 --> 01:34:51.117]  So it's an open-ended, yeah, the law says you can do it, but I say you can't, and I'm not going to tell you whether I'm going to arrest you or not.
[01:34:51.157 --> 01:34:51.838]  That is cough-esque.
[01:34:51.918 --> 01:34:52.298]  That is 1984.
[01:34:52.358 --> 01:34:54.020]  That is serious.
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:58.224]  And look, just like two years ago, I said it on air like 20 times at least.
[01:34:58.885 --> 01:35:00.847]  People picked it up and said, oh look, tomorrow's Tuesday.
[01:35:00.867 --> 01:35:02.028]  It wasn't a hard call.
[01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:12.093]   When in Virginia and other areas around the country, Maryland, you name it, The teachers' union said, oh, terrorists are threatening us.
[01:35:12.493 --> 01:35:13.554]  We want FBI.
[01:35:14.395 --> 01:35:15.435]  We want Justice Department.
[01:35:15.816 --> 01:35:17.857]  I said, I guarantee you the Justice Department told them to do that.
[01:35:18.237 --> 01:35:21.159]  And it came out like a year later that the Justice Department told them to do that.
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:27.824]  They had like FBI helicopters land at the school board meetings and guys with like earpieces threatening people.
[01:35:28.904 --> 01:35:30.265]  Because they want you to shut up.
[01:35:33.507 --> 01:35:34.828]  They want you to go away.
[01:35:34.888 --> 01:35:38.531]  They want you to bow down to everything they're doing.
[01:35:39.502 --> 01:35:44.985]  Now, Enrique Tarrio and several other Proud Boys are scheduled from prison to call in.
[01:35:45.005 --> 01:35:52.230]  I didn't hype it up, because when they find out they're about to come on, they tell them, you're being moved, and they lock them in the bottom of the jail repeatedly.
[01:35:53.531 --> 01:35:55.132]  So, they don't want them on the show.
[01:35:55.272 --> 01:35:57.954]  We've been threatened to have them on, whatever we're having them on.
[01:35:58.294 --> 01:36:00.996]  Owen Schroer is on an airplane to D.C.
[01:36:01.036 --> 01:36:03.037]  They're trying to put him in jail for his speech.
[01:36:03.057 --> 01:36:06.139]  We're going to cover that as well next hour.
[01:36:09.201 --> 01:36:14.142]  I'm going to play Tim Pool talking about this and show you the documents.
[01:36:14.723 --> 01:36:17.703]  A little short segment and then that'll dovetail into these guys.
[01:36:17.723 --> 01:36:18.863]  But I know the Proud Boys.
[01:36:19.064 --> 01:36:20.504]  I know they were there to defend B-Bowl.
[01:36:21.004 --> 01:36:22.784]  I know they were there if Antifa attacked us.
[01:36:23.484 --> 01:36:24.805]  They've never attacked any other building.
[01:36:24.825 --> 01:36:25.565]  They've never broken anything.
[01:36:25.925 --> 01:36:26.625]  They were set up.
[01:36:27.025 --> 01:36:27.805]  It was all made up.
[01:36:28.145 --> 01:36:29.066]  Joe Biggs touched us.
[01:36:31.547 --> 01:36:34.508]  Barrier that was being shaken by others, and Ray K wasn't even there.
[01:36:34.888 --> 01:36:41.229]  But Ray Epstein told them in text messages, I orchestrated it and said, go in the Capitol and help pick up signs and ram them into people.
[01:36:41.489 --> 01:36:41.909]  He's free.
[01:36:42.809 --> 01:36:43.389]  So that's coming up.

[01:37:11.617 --> 01:37:12.898]  You see them trying to put us in prison.
[01:37:13.138 --> 01:37:14.138]  You see us going all the way.
[01:37:14.438 --> 01:37:16.819]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support.

[01:37:34.492 --> 01:37:36.634]  I'm fighting with everything I've got.
[01:37:37.255 --> 01:37:39.417]  And I'm counting on you to back me and I appreciate you.
[01:37:39.697 --> 01:37:40.458]  And I love you to death.
[01:37:41.038 --> 01:37:43.120]  But we're in your hands, so please take action.
[01:37:43.421 --> 01:37:48.421]   Alright, we'll be right back with our number three with the political prisoners, if they're able to make it.
[01:37:48.421 --> 01:38:04.421]  It's just a mask.
[01:38:04.759 --> 01:38:05.820]  It's just six feet.
[01:38:06.581 --> 01:38:08.443]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[01:38:09.144 --> 01:38:10.846]  It's just non-essential workers.
[01:38:11.567 --> 01:38:13.409]  It's just until we work it out.
[01:38:14.110 --> 01:38:14.991]  It's just a bar.
[01:38:15.632 --> 01:38:16.813]  It's just a restaurant.
[01:38:17.802 --> 01:38:18.963]  It's just nursing homes.
[01:38:19.683 --> 01:38:20.784]  It's just schools.
[01:38:21.564 --> 01:38:24.166]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[01:38:24.846 --> 01:38:26.668]  It's just until the cases go down.
[01:38:27.428 --> 01:38:29.049]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[01:38:29.689 --> 01:38:31.791]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[01:38:32.511 --> 01:38:34.172]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[01:38:34.953 --> 01:38:38.975]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[01:38:39.536 --> 01:38:41.217]  It's just churches and mosques.
[01:38:41.997 --> 01:38:42.998]  It's just singing.
[01:38:43.678 --> 01:38:45.659]  It's just travel.
[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:48.101]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[01:38:48.841 --> 01:38:50.102]  It's just for the greater good.
[01:38:50.803 --> 01:38:54.065]  It's just fact-checking, not censorship.
[01:38:54.705 --> 01:38:56.126]  It's just mandatory.
[01:38:56.706 --> 01:38:57.907]  It isn't just at all.
[01:38:58.548 --> 01:39:01.910]  Visit DefendJones.com to help fight back today.
[01:39:03.291 --> 01:39:06.312]  Owen Schroer is being targeted by the DOJ.
[01:39:06.352 --> 01:39:08.294]  They want 120 days in prison.
[01:39:08.334 --> 01:39:08.574]  Why?
[01:39:09.534 --> 01:39:09.755]  Speech.
[01:39:10.808 --> 01:39:17.171]  Owen Schroyer, a pundit, personality and journalist for Infowars, said some things.
[01:39:17.191 --> 01:39:20.833]  And for the things he said, the DOJ says he should go to prison for it.
[01:39:21.113 --> 01:39:22.534]  And this is what I said was going to happen.
[01:39:23.234 --> 01:39:31.838]  I said, now they're going after, they go after Trump, they go after his lawyers, the next people in line are going to be the pundits who are advocating for or encouraging people on January 6th.
[01:39:32.199 --> 01:39:34.300]  First person in line, Owen Schroyer.
[01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:36.201]  Now, a few important details.
[01:39:36.541 --> 01:39:38.362]  He did not go into the Capitol.
[01:39:38.982 --> 01:39:43.244]  The Infowars team had a permit to have a rally outside the Capitol in a different area.
[01:39:43.784 --> 01:39:46.305]  Owen Schroer was on Capitol grounds.
[01:39:46.425 --> 01:39:48.707]  This is the initial pretext they get to charge him.
[01:39:48.727 --> 01:39:49.427]  He pleads guilty.
[01:39:50.007 --> 01:40:02.413]  They then say, in the sentencing document, the prosecutor says, because of his speech before, during, and after the event, he should get this amount of time in prison.
[01:40:03.632 --> 01:40:06.435]  And I'm going to actually show you the recommended sentencing document.
[01:40:06.455 --> 01:40:07.957]  But people say, well, why did he plead guilty?
[01:40:08.878 --> 01:40:11.160]  He raised $240-something thousand dollars.
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.082]  They've deposed him over and over again.
[01:40:13.182 --> 01:40:14.784]  They've dragged him into D.C.
[01:40:14.844 --> 01:40:15.465]  over and over again.
[01:40:17.324 --> 01:40:18.585]  He's already spent all that money.
[01:40:18.625 --> 01:40:19.645]  People say, well, that's a lot of money.
[01:40:19.845 --> 01:40:21.066]  That's nothing in these cases.
[01:40:21.366 --> 01:40:22.967]  They wanted several years in jail before.
[01:40:23.547 --> 01:40:28.469]  Then they say, well, give us your phones and we'll drop the charges or go easy on you.
[01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:29.629]  He asked permission.
[01:40:29.649 --> 01:40:30.250]  He said, sit down.
[01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:31.730]  I said, yeah, there's nothing to hide there.
[01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:32.451]  We tried to stop it.
[01:40:32.791 --> 01:40:33.711]  He gives them the phones.
[01:40:34.211 --> 01:40:34.952]  They go, you know what?
[01:40:35.012 --> 01:40:35.952]  We're breaking that deal.
[01:40:36.673 --> 01:40:37.393]  We want jail time.
[01:40:37.413 --> 01:40:39.214]  So Owen didn't turn state's evidence.
[01:40:39.534 --> 01:40:43.716]  If you're innocent, you go, well, OK, here's my dash cam footage or here's my doorbell ring.
[01:40:43.756 --> 01:40:46.557]  Let's say somebody comes to your house with a doorbell camera.
[01:40:47.062 --> 01:40:49.863]  And they pull a gun out and start shooting at you, you shoot them back.
[01:40:50.283 --> 01:40:52.803]  And the feds say, well give us the tape and we'll go easy on you.
[01:40:52.843 --> 01:40:54.244]  You're like, well here's the tape, they attacked me.
[01:40:55.044 --> 01:40:58.105]  So, totally disingenuous, totally out of control.
[01:40:58.865 --> 01:41:01.766]  And it would have cost like a million dollars to go to trial in D.C.
[01:41:02.026 --> 01:41:03.806]  They'd have convicted him, sent him to jail for years.
[01:41:04.246 --> 01:41:05.627]  You don't get a fair trial in D.C.
[01:41:05.647 --> 01:41:08.207]  This is the same judge that hung up the Proud Boys.
[01:41:09.608 --> 01:41:12.668]  And so now he's facing up to a year actually.
[01:41:12.888 --> 01:41:14.009]  That's the minimum, is the 120 days.
[01:41:15.828 --> 01:41:19.410]  And what's frustrating is great folks out there have all reported on this.
[01:41:19.690 --> 01:41:21.691]  It's also been all over mainstream news about Owen.
[01:41:23.151 --> 01:41:24.692]  The media's like, well good, he deserves jail.
[01:41:24.832 --> 01:41:26.113]  Control corporate press for a speech.
[01:41:26.713 --> 01:41:34.197]  They're all talking about in the sentencing document what he said before and during January 6th.
[01:41:35.472 --> 01:41:36.753]  Which is like, I question the election.
[01:41:36.793 --> 01:41:37.653]  They say he deserves jail.
[01:41:38.054 --> 01:41:43.297]  They cite him this summer on his show in the document.
[01:41:43.337 --> 01:41:44.617]  I'm going to go to break here in a moment.
[01:41:44.818 --> 01:41:45.698]  I've got some time now.
[01:41:45.758 --> 01:41:46.659]  I want to show it to you.
[01:41:47.059 --> 01:41:49.040]  I showed it the other day on Friday.
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:50.021]  It still didn't get picked up.
[01:41:50.701 --> 01:41:52.382]  It says he's not remorseful.
[01:41:52.942 --> 01:41:54.763]  He still says the election was stolen.
[01:41:54.823 --> 01:41:55.804]  Therefore, we want jail.
[01:41:56.164 --> 01:41:58.125]  Folks, that goes 100% against federal law.
[01:41:58.866 --> 01:42:00.207]  That's totally protected free speech.
[01:42:00.427 --> 01:42:02.048]  Whether he's right or wrong, of course he's right.
[01:42:03.114 --> 01:42:04.055]  Of course the election was stolen.
[01:42:04.075 --> 01:42:04.455]  I'll say it.
[01:42:04.475 --> 01:42:05.315]  2020 was stolen.
[01:42:05.756 --> 01:42:06.116]  2020 was stolen.
[01:42:06.356 --> 01:42:11.019]  The Democrats run around all the time saying elections are stolen and say stuff way more than we do with no evidence.
[01:42:12.099 --> 01:42:12.800]  So look at this.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:14.641]  Here's the document.
[01:42:15.061 --> 01:42:16.582]  This is their charging recommendation.
[01:42:16.982 --> 01:42:18.924]  And I've already read the whole thing on air before.
[01:42:19.484 --> 01:42:21.125]  But everybody focuses on what they said.
[01:42:21.205 --> 01:42:22.806]  Oh, what he said then he deserves jail.
[01:42:23.346 --> 01:42:24.227]  No calls for violence.
[01:42:24.267 --> 01:42:25.147]  Just saying elections are stolen.
[01:42:25.167 --> 01:42:25.748]  Let's protest.
[01:42:26.288 --> 01:42:27.789]  Look at this document.
[01:42:29.110 --> 01:42:35.795]  He continued, we will not accept the fake election of the child molesting Joe Biden, the Chinese Communist agent Joe Biden.
[01:42:35.815 --> 01:42:38.057]  We know where he belongs, in jail.
[01:42:38.357 --> 01:42:39.718]  They go on to say he deserves prison for that.
[01:42:40.639 --> 01:42:41.980]  So this is on January 6th.
[01:42:42.321 --> 01:42:44.522]  Then they lie and say he breached it, ignored police.
[01:42:44.542 --> 01:42:46.444]  The police told us go up and try to stop people.
[01:42:46.684 --> 01:42:47.565]  We have it on video.
[01:42:47.785 --> 01:42:48.525]  The feds know that.
[01:42:48.545 --> 01:42:49.306]  Okay?
[01:42:51.067 --> 01:42:52.068]  Announce Detroit and others.
[01:42:52.148 --> 01:42:52.789]  Let us break.
[01:42:54.045 --> 01:42:54.505]  Right here.
[01:42:54.645 --> 01:42:59.547]  Let me talk to this cop and see if I can, person one, get up there and de-escalate the situation.
[01:42:59.967 --> 01:43:00.608]  That's me.
[01:43:01.068 --> 01:43:03.489]  And the cops say, yeah, go up on the steps, try to stop it.
[01:43:03.769 --> 01:43:05.350]  They say the cops told us to go away.
[01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:08.351]  We have it on video saying, go up there and quote, use your First Amendment.
[01:43:08.611 --> 01:43:09.671]  They know all this.
[01:43:10.192 --> 01:43:11.552]  They're lying in federal court.
[01:43:12.973 --> 01:43:16.794]  And it goes on here to say, oh, several attempts to get positive response from police.
[01:43:17.014 --> 01:43:18.355]  We have them on video saying, help.
[01:43:19.861 --> 01:43:20.442]  And it goes on.
[01:43:20.482 --> 01:43:21.583]  Oh, he chanted USA 7076.
[01:43:22.725 --> 01:43:24.126]  He deserves prison time for that.
[01:43:25.048 --> 01:43:25.989]  Now this is where it gets key.
[01:43:26.429 --> 01:43:27.030]  Page 14.
[01:43:27.551 --> 01:43:30.995]  He went on to say we should have rejected the narrative of January 6th.
[01:43:31.215 --> 01:43:35.280]  They're talking about him on May 19th and saying that we don't believe the election.
[01:43:35.741 --> 01:43:37.143]  They say we want jail time for that.
[01:43:38.883 --> 01:43:43.926]  I'm going to take my time on this because they're going to be calling for prison, so they'll get like a few minutes to be hung up on.
[01:43:44.306 --> 01:43:45.507]  And I'm going to go over all this.
[01:43:45.527 --> 01:43:49.169]  But they say right here, he still says the election was stolen.
[01:43:49.469 --> 01:43:50.770]  Therefore, we want prison time.
[01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:52.932]  I mean, this is the murder of the First Amendment.
[01:43:53.712 --> 01:43:54.032]  All right.
[01:43:54.072 --> 01:43:57.855]  We are live in our number three on this September 11th, 2023 transmission.
[01:44:00.817 --> 01:44:10.860]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and Enrique Tarrio, the supposed mastermind of January 6th, which is totally fraudulent, wasn't even there, he is going to be calling in about 15 minutes.
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:14.300]  But Dominique Pozzola has also been convicted.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:17.641]  They used terrorism charges on him to give them longer sentences.
[01:44:17.681 --> 01:44:23.783]  We had, of course, last week, Joe Biggs, totally innocent, pointing that out.
[01:44:24.583 --> 01:44:26.204]  They said that he cried during sentencing.
[01:44:26.224 --> 01:44:28.185]  No, he cried when he saw his daughter in the courtroom.
[01:44:28.205 --> 01:44:30.086]  We won't be seeing for decades.
[01:44:30.646 --> 01:44:31.967]  And the media celebrated that.
[01:44:32.467 --> 01:44:34.288]  Enrique Tarrio against coming up.
[01:44:34.689 --> 01:44:36.289]  But I wanted to go to Dominic Pozzola.
[01:44:36.670 --> 01:44:40.232]  GiveSendGo.com forward slash help Dom.
[01:44:40.292 --> 01:44:41.973]  That's help D-O-M.
[01:44:42.493 --> 01:44:43.393]  We're going to appeal this.
[01:44:43.413 --> 01:44:44.274]  We're going to fight this.
[01:44:44.774 --> 01:44:48.116]  I've been told by people, oh, leave this alone or the feds will come after you.
[01:44:49.693 --> 01:44:50.473]  And lose my soul?
[01:44:50.493 --> 01:44:51.373]  It's not going to happen.
[01:44:52.073 --> 01:44:53.794]  This is serious business.
[01:44:54.434 --> 01:44:57.034]  So we can put up articles about Dominique Pozzola.
[01:44:57.074 --> 01:44:59.735]  Dominique, I know you've only got a few minutes here before they cut you off.
[01:45:00.755 --> 01:45:01.995]  You've got the floor now to speak.
[01:45:02.035 --> 01:45:19.400]   We know that Enrique finally got on shows late last week and pointed out the feds came to him, Roger Stone said this too, during his whole show trial for quote, lying to Congress and said, just tell us Trump Is a Russian agent and we'll drop all this.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:21.201]  So he's saying the same thing happened.
[01:45:21.221 --> 01:45:23.002]  Did you witness any of that first off?
[01:45:23.042 --> 01:45:25.824]  And just it's your chance to speak to the world.
[01:45:25.844 --> 01:45:26.144]  Go ahead.
[01:45:26.204 --> 01:45:26.805]  Thanks for being with us.
[01:45:29.026 --> 01:45:30.748]  Hey Alex, thanks for having us on.
[01:45:30.828 --> 01:45:32.829]  Enrique's on the line too, just in case you want to know.
[01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:35.732]  We're both on the same tablet right now.
[01:45:35.752 --> 01:45:39.415]  But yeah, the feds did the same thing to me as they did to Enrique.
[01:45:39.455 --> 01:45:41.216]  They tried to get me to lie about Joe Biggs.
[01:45:41.256 --> 01:45:43.638]  They wanted me to say that he had a gun there that day.
[01:45:44.098 --> 01:45:45.920]  They were going to give me a sweetheart plea deal.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.142]  I would have only had to cop out to one charge.
[01:45:49.343 --> 01:45:53.266]  I would have been home in 33 to 41 months, told me I probably wouldn't even serve half of that.
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:46:01.862]  But, uh, you know, at some point you gotta look at yourself in the mirror again, so you gotta figure out what's more important, your integrity or, you know, dealing with these people.
[01:46:02.386 --> 01:46:03.866]  So, I didn't do it.
[01:46:04.047 --> 01:46:05.447]  And they did the same thing to Enrique.
[01:46:05.487 --> 01:46:07.268]  They wanted him to lie about President Trump.
[01:46:08.068 --> 01:46:08.968]  But he didn't do it.
[01:46:09.568 --> 01:46:13.890]  And, you know, I think that's part of the reason why they gave us such ridiculous sentences.
[01:46:13.930 --> 01:46:17.691]  Because, you know, I think they're pissed off that they couldn't get us to work with them, first of all.
[01:46:18.311 --> 01:46:20.472]  I mean, who gets 10 years for breaking a window?
[01:46:20.772 --> 01:46:23.693]  Who gets 22 years for not even being there?
[01:46:23.913 --> 01:46:25.814]  Who gets 18 years for shaking a fence?
[01:46:25.834 --> 01:46:26.674]  This is ridiculous.
[01:46:26.994 --> 01:46:28.375]  This is absolutely ridiculous.
[01:46:29.515 --> 01:46:32.737]  The judges in these trials are the biggest problem.
[01:46:33.177 --> 01:46:36.059]  I mean, our judge told us that his hands were tied.
[01:46:36.119 --> 01:46:42.783]  He had to give us the terrorism answer because that's the way Congress wrote it up and if we didn't like it to speak to Congress.
[01:46:42.823 --> 01:46:44.584]  We all know that's not true.
[01:46:44.664 --> 01:46:46.485]  A judge has discretion to do whatever they want.
[01:46:46.845 --> 01:46:50.747]  We were the only ones charged with terrorism for minor property damage.
[01:46:50.807 --> 01:46:52.428]  I'm talking about only a couple hundred bucks.
[01:46:52.948 --> 01:47:03.011]  Which wouldn't even happen in the first place if the Capitol Police didn't start open firing on people and killing people and hurting people that day, which drove everyone into a frenzy.
[01:47:04.012 --> 01:47:11.674]  What do you make of Ray Epps saying in the congressional testimony he orchestrated it, told people to go in, lifted up barriers, ran them into police.
[01:47:12.434 --> 01:47:13.575]  Why is he so protected?
[01:47:13.595 --> 01:47:14.415]  Who do you think he works for?
[01:47:16.448 --> 01:47:28.175]  Well, one of my attorneys, Roger Roos, has been trying to dig into RAFs for a while, so he actually had a meeting with the prosecutors and asked them, does RAFs work for you guys?
[01:47:28.335 --> 01:47:29.536]  Is he an FBI asset?
[01:47:29.956 --> 01:47:31.858]  They said, no, he does not work for us.
[01:47:32.738 --> 01:47:34.939]  So Roger says, okay, well let me ask you this question.
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:39.502]  Does RAFs work for the Department of Homeland Security or any other agency?
[01:47:39.963 --> 01:47:42.084]  Their response was, we don't have to tell you that.
[01:47:44.432 --> 01:47:46.393]  Absolutely, and there's dozens of these agencies.
[01:47:46.433 --> 01:47:49.995]  Dominique, people need to go to GibsonGo.com forward slash help Dom.
[01:47:50.416 --> 01:47:52.237]  It's sad to see you've raised less than $1,000.
[01:47:52.677 --> 01:47:54.398]  You need to appeal this for all of us.
[01:47:55.159 --> 01:47:58.841]  Again, we're going to the public here for support, but this is what's happening to you is deadly wrong.
[01:47:58.861 --> 01:48:00.962]  We're only asking you for $100,000, folks.
[01:48:00.982 --> 01:48:01.683]  We're all next.
[01:48:02.083 --> 01:48:03.263]  We don't stand up for Dominique.
[01:48:03.283 --> 01:48:05.545]  Dominique, I'm going to go back to you.
[01:48:05.565 --> 01:48:07.206]  I understand you're sharing the phone.
[01:48:07.246 --> 01:48:08.727]  We'll do the whole hour if you guys can.
[01:48:08.747 --> 01:48:11.508]  You've got to call back and forth on each person's 15 minutes.
[01:48:11.548 --> 01:48:13.550]  I want to hand the phone to Enrique Tarrio.
[01:48:14.590 --> 01:48:38.947]  Enrique, before we get into the case and what you're going through and all the rest of it, give Sin Go, obviously for you, people can support you at tariofamilyfund.org, but you dropped a bombshell that the feds came to you, you named names, they take a lot of courage when you're in the federal system, because, you know, people disappear sometimes when they do that, and you named names about the meetings, them telling you, say that Trump ordered you to do this and you're going to be going scot-free.
[01:48:39.267 --> 01:48:40.388]  Enrique, thanks for joining us.
[01:48:42.145 --> 01:48:43.705]  Well, thank you for having me on, Alex.
[01:48:44.066 --> 01:48:45.526]  You're 100% right about that.
[01:48:45.786 --> 01:48:47.307]  They came to me back in October of 2022.
[01:48:47.387 --> 01:48:52.088]  They didn't come to figure out what happened.
[01:48:52.388 --> 01:48:55.889]  They came to tell me, sign this and you'll be free.
[01:48:56.229 --> 01:49:00.511]  And if you don't sign it, we're going to take you to trial and you're going to do a lot of time in jail.
[01:49:01.451 --> 01:49:04.053]  We know what option I took.
[01:49:04.213 --> 01:49:07.455]  I'm sitting here, I mean, I'm flabbergasted.
[01:49:07.475 --> 01:49:11.358]  22 years for not, really, for not turning in Trump.
[01:49:11.398 --> 01:49:12.459]  That's what they wanted to do.
[01:49:12.779 --> 01:49:15.961]  And that's how they're going to present this case to a D.C.
[01:49:16.021 --> 01:49:17.742]  jury, Alex.
[01:49:17.843 --> 01:49:25.608]  They're going to go ahead and they're going to find people, they're going to scare them with jail time, or they're going to tell them that they're not going to get jail time, and they're going to have to lie.
[01:49:25.728 --> 01:49:26.889]  That's what they asked me to do.
[01:49:27.169 --> 01:49:28.210]  They asked me to lie.
[01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:29.651]  And that's not going to happen.
[01:49:30.199 --> 01:49:31.500]  Well, name names specifically.
[01:49:31.540 --> 01:49:32.040]  Where were you?
[01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:32.660]  What did they say?
[01:49:34.161 --> 01:49:35.101]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[01:49:35.281 --> 01:49:40.203]  I didn't name any names in that meeting, but I'm going to name names here on InfoWars.
[01:49:40.243 --> 01:49:41.064]  Oh, I misunderstood.
[01:49:41.104 --> 01:49:41.684]  I thought you did.
[01:49:41.704 --> 01:49:42.564]  Go ahead.
[01:49:42.884 --> 01:49:43.404]  Start over.
[01:49:43.705 --> 01:49:44.185]  No, no, no.
[01:49:44.525 --> 01:49:54.029]  Jocelyn Ballantyne is a supervising prosecutor right under Michael Graves, okay, which has a heavy hand in prosecuting Trump.
[01:49:54.749 --> 01:50:03.994]  Um, and then Jason McCullough was another prosecutor that's in there and they're the ones that sat there and they went ahead and they're the ones that asked me to lie.
[01:50:04.014 --> 01:50:06.015]  They didn't ask me to tell them the truth.
[01:50:06.315 --> 01:50:07.416]  They asked me to lie.
[01:50:07.756 --> 01:50:09.497]  And the truth is I am not going to lie.
[01:50:09.537 --> 01:50:11.278]  I did not take their fake deal.
[01:50:11.578 --> 01:50:11.998]  I did not.
[01:50:12.438 --> 01:50:13.859]  I'm not going to lie about anything.
[01:50:14.019 --> 01:50:15.840]  I am completely innocent of these charges.
[01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:18.161]  Well, tell us the time, the time, the place.
[01:50:18.181 --> 01:50:19.222]  What do they say specifically?
[01:50:21.355 --> 01:50:26.220]  Um, so basically, uh, they wanted to connect the Proud Boys to, uh, to January 6th.
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:31.785]  And what they wanted me to do is they wanted me to confirm their story, their story completely.
[01:50:31.805 --> 01:50:36.609]  And, uh, and I, like I said, I completely declined them on it because for one, it's not true.
[01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:42.895]  Um, and two, I'm not going to sacrifice myself, uh, for, for the, to do their bidding.
[01:50:43.375 --> 01:50:43.656]  Okay.
[01:50:43.716 --> 01:50:45.037]  I'm sitting here as an innocent man.
[01:50:45.077 --> 01:50:45.878]  I took him to trial.
[01:50:49.184 --> 01:50:50.346]  So give us the specifics.
[01:50:50.366 --> 01:50:51.127]  What did they say to you?
[01:50:52.889 --> 01:50:54.270]  Okay, so what they... I'm sorry.
[01:50:54.551 --> 01:51:06.446]  What they asked me to say is that through a third party, through a person of a person of a person, that Trump communicated with me and I was communicating with Trump to do the events that happened on January 6th.
[01:51:07.153 --> 01:51:08.373]  That's basically what they told me.
[01:51:08.773 --> 01:51:11.374]  They told me, confirm this story for us, right?
[01:51:11.634 --> 01:51:16.135]  This is our story, it's a complete concoction, and we'll let you free.
[01:51:16.496 --> 01:51:17.836]  So basically that's what they wanted to do.
[01:51:17.876 --> 01:51:20.397]  They wanted me to connect Trump to January 6th.
[01:51:20.777 --> 01:51:26.458]  Because as we've seen the indictment, Trump's not indicted for anything, for not inciting the crowd.
[01:51:26.838 --> 01:51:36.114]   He's indicted for phone calls, bullshit phone calls, I'm sorry, bullcrap phone calls to to Georgia and all this made up other things.
[01:51:36.114 --> 01:51:41.654]   And what ends up happening is they wanted to connect him to the actual events of January 6th.
[01:51:41.654 --> 01:51:44.654]   And they wanted to do it through me, and that's not going to happen.
[01:51:44.654 --> 01:51:46.154]  What did you say to them?
[01:51:46.154 --> 01:51:50.453]   We know they did this with Russiagate and the impeachments, told people to lie, that's come out in court.
[01:51:50.453 --> 01:51:52.453]  What did you say to them when they said that?
[01:51:52.453 --> 01:51:56.755]  Uh, I won't be able to say it on the show.
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:59.201]  Say it on air and we'll delay it out, but not for the internet.
[01:51:59.221 --> 01:52:00.301]  What did you say, John?
[01:52:01.341 --> 01:52:03.522]  I told him to go pound Sam, Alex.
[01:52:03.722 --> 01:52:04.902]  I told him to go pound Sam.
[01:52:05.662 --> 01:52:08.983]  What was the exact quote?
[01:52:09.023 --> 01:52:10.164]  Did you say, fuck you?
[01:52:12.024 --> 01:52:13.325]  I told him to go fuck off.
[01:52:13.365 --> 01:52:16.265]  Put it this way, my attorney told me to calm down after I said that.
[01:52:17.506 --> 01:52:17.886]  Keep going.
[01:52:20.163 --> 01:52:23.127]  Uh, yeah, so, my attorney told me to- I told him to go fuck off.
[01:52:23.167 --> 01:52:25.089]  My attorney told me to calm down after that.
[01:52:25.530 --> 01:52:27.232]  And, um, I mean, that was the end of it.
[01:52:27.292 --> 01:52:29.315]  They wanted me to come- They had it in writing, Alex!
[01:52:29.675 --> 01:52:32.579]  They had it in writing, already ready for me to sign.
[01:52:32.939 --> 01:52:34.461]  They didn't care- And you know what?
[01:52:34.881 --> 01:52:38.366]  I get what investigators' job do- is, is to investigate.
[01:52:38.786 --> 01:52:46.770]  But after that, after I told them to go fuck off, right, an investigator would ask a question like, okay, well, if this didn't happen, what happened?
[01:52:46.810 --> 01:52:47.911]  They didn't even ask that.
[01:52:48.351 --> 01:52:51.072]  They said, okay, go fuck off.
[01:52:51.212 --> 01:52:51.873]  Okay, that's it.
[01:52:51.893 --> 01:52:52.773]  We're going to give you the time.
[01:52:52.853 --> 01:52:53.754]  This is my story.
[01:52:55.034 --> 01:52:56.395]  And you don't want to sign off on it?
[01:52:56.415 --> 01:52:57.516]  Well, then that's fine.
[01:52:59.477 --> 01:53:00.117]  Incredible.
[01:53:00.377 --> 01:53:02.058]  So we thought, yeah.
[01:53:03.106 --> 01:53:06.609]  And that's how they're going to do with all the other witnesses that they have against Trump.
[01:53:07.330 --> 01:53:10.813]  I heard reports that they got somebody to flip from the Mar-a-Lago case.
[01:53:10.913 --> 01:53:13.395]  They did the same exact thing to him, Alex.
[01:53:13.435 --> 01:53:16.297]  Let's not bullcrop the American public.
[01:53:16.597 --> 01:53:17.278]  That's what they did.
[01:53:17.578 --> 01:53:20.140]  They went to this guy and they said, we're going to put you in jail for decades.
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:21.441]  Look what we did to the Proud Boys.
[01:53:21.702 --> 01:53:22.943]  We're going to do that to you too.
[01:53:23.263 --> 01:53:26.746]  And because we did that to you too, you're going to have to lie.
[01:53:27.905 --> 01:53:31.568]  And that person, that person needs to stand up and say no.
[01:53:31.768 --> 01:53:43.236]  And Alex, if I could just say one thing, man, just because the way it went down in our court, these judges and these prosecutors, especially the judges, they have totally twisted and distorted the meaning of the word conspiracy.
[01:53:43.577 --> 01:53:47.900]  A conspiracy right now, like it used to have to know the people that met them, had a plan, something.
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:53.344]  They have changed the definition of conspiracy just for our trial to simply a meeting of the minds.
[01:53:53.837 --> 01:53:55.377]  So you don't even have to know the person.
[01:53:55.397 --> 01:53:56.918]  You don't have to be in the same room as the person.
[01:53:57.278 --> 01:54:01.939]  As long as you both have the same thought process, they will connect you in a conspiracy.
[01:54:02.279 --> 01:54:04.860]  That's what they tried doing with us, and that's what they're going to try doing with Trump.
[01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:08.201]  They're going to try saying, because Trump said, proud boys, stand back and stand by.
[01:54:08.221 --> 01:54:13.943]  They're going to say, well, he knew that the proud boys supported him, and he knew that if he said that, they would be standing back and standing by.
[01:54:14.203 --> 01:54:15.263]  So here's the conspiracy.
[01:54:15.303 --> 01:54:16.703]  This is how we're going to wrap these guys up in this.
[01:54:17.364 --> 01:54:24.537]   Alex, just as you know, Alex, being somebody like that, Your phone glows up all day, right?
[01:54:24.797 --> 01:54:28.760]  The person that they wanted me to do the connection with is somebody that I've never talked to.
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:34.144]  Somebody that's texted me about seven or eight times while I've replied once with yes.
[01:54:35.932 --> 01:54:40.133]  So they didn't try to connect you to me or Roger Stone.
[01:54:39.972 --> 01:54:46.512]   back in July of 2020 and this person has just been annoying and just messaging me
[01:54:46.512 --> 01:54:51.033]   and that's how they wanted that that was a connection that's how they wanted so
[01:54:51.033 --> 01:54:55.072]   they didn't try to connect you to me or Roger Stone can you tell us the person
[01:54:55.072 --> 01:54:57.432]  they wanted to connect you to?
[01:54:57.432 --> 01:55:01.073]  Unfortunately I can't say the name of...
[01:54:59.159 --> 01:55:02.502]  I'm trying to work with my attorney to see what is it that we could and we can't say.
[01:55:02.882 --> 01:55:05.143]  But unfortunately, I can't say the name of the person.
[01:55:05.544 --> 01:55:07.685]  But I will tell you that it's there.
[01:55:07.745 --> 01:55:08.526]  The paperwork's there.
[01:55:08.826 --> 01:55:11.648]  Enrique, you only get 15 minutes apiece.
[01:55:11.668 --> 01:55:12.929]  You're sharing the phone callback.
[01:55:12.949 --> 01:55:13.749]  We'll do the whole hour.
[01:55:13.769 --> 01:55:15.370]  I don't know how many people you got there to do it.
[01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:16.751]  You got to have more than obviously two to do that.
[01:55:17.152 --> 01:55:20.014]  But in case you don't get back on, come back on as soon as you can.
[01:55:20.354 --> 01:55:23.676]  Let's be clear, you're not going to commit suicide or hang yourself like Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:55:24.036 --> 01:55:26.138]  You got a lot of courage, brother, and I really admire you.
[01:55:26.698 --> 01:55:28.059]  You're a bull here.
[01:55:28.420 --> 01:55:30.181]  Let's get it on record, you're not going to commit suicide.
[01:55:31.843 --> 01:55:34.065]  I'm not going to do any of that, Alex.
[01:55:34.145 --> 01:55:36.527]  I love my life too much and I have way too much hope for that.
[01:55:36.887 --> 01:55:40.330]  Okay, I have way too much hope that... Well, I don't have way too much hope.
[01:55:40.410 --> 01:55:46.876]  I have hope that the American people are going to do the right thing and they're going to elect the right president now come 2024.
[01:55:47.016 --> 01:55:49.979]  I have a little bit of hope.
[01:55:50.159 --> 01:55:54.479]   that we're going to beat this on appeals, okay, because obviously we have to fight the D.C.
[01:55:54.479 --> 01:55:58.639]   the D.C. swamp first and then we got to take it all the way up to the Supreme Court.
[01:55:58.639 --> 01:56:03.758]   So hopefully in one of those, but 22 years, I mean that's no joke. I don't think 22 months is
[01:56:03.758 --> 01:56:08.959]   a joke in these January 6th cases, let alone 22 years of my life. But I don't care how many years,
[01:56:08.959 --> 01:56:14.479]   I'm not going to roll for anybody. Well if you just spend like Black Lives Matter burning down
[01:56:14.479 --> 01:56:19.998]   millions of dollars and shooting police officers, you'd be fine. I mean I guess if I didn't want to
[01:56:19.998 --> 01:56:23.278]   be in jail, I was on the wrong side of the fence, I should have.
[01:56:23.432 --> 01:56:24.493]  I should have done what they did.
[01:56:24.774 --> 01:56:28.037]  I mean, they're getting millions of dollars from the government of New York, aren't they?
[01:56:28.057 --> 01:56:33.924]  Every major city they rioted in and attacked, they're getting millions of dollars.
[01:56:35.612 --> 01:56:38.354]  Yeah, yeah, and, you know, I'd be a millionaire right now.
[01:56:38.614 --> 01:56:39.595]  And let me tell you something.
[01:56:39.895 --> 01:56:46.980]  If I, all I had to do was lie, and I could have been in my cushy bed right now, in my warm bed, laughing at the world right now.
[01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:49.682]  You have one minute remaining.
[01:56:50.743 --> 01:56:53.405]  I would have been a hero to the left, Alex.
[01:56:53.565 --> 01:56:58.129]  I would have been a hero to the left, and I would have probably lived as comfortable as a traitor, okay?
[01:56:58.509 --> 01:56:59.450]  But I didn't do that.
[01:56:59.530 --> 01:57:17.308]   Now I'm sitting in a, in, in a cell that's Smaller than a guest bathroom in the average American home, because I sat here and I'm standing on my values and four of these guys sitting next to me right now, including the brave Mr. Prezola right here that has a brass set of balls on him.

[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:54.762]  This is absolutely insane.

[01:58:34.796 --> 01:58:35.577]  We'll have them back up.
[01:58:35.637 --> 01:58:40.440]  I was confused because I thought Enrique was on first, but he gave the phone to Dominique.
[01:58:41.161 --> 01:58:43.983]  Enrique is totally right.
[01:58:45.364 --> 01:58:46.925]  They are doing this to target everybody.
[01:58:48.206 --> 01:58:49.427]  They're doing this to send a message.
[01:58:49.447 --> 01:58:51.668]  Can you imagine?
[01:58:51.968 --> 01:58:56.892]  I'm sitting here, I could roll over and shut up about this, but how do you shut up?
[01:58:57.692 --> 01:58:58.913]  How do you just let this happen?
[01:59:00.848 --> 01:59:01.768]  Die a thousand deaths.
[01:59:02.609 --> 01:59:04.470]  Coward dies a thousand deaths.
[01:59:05.150 --> 01:59:06.811]  A man that's not a coward only dies once.
[01:59:07.751 --> 01:59:09.472]  Now, I cannot skip the network breaks.
[01:59:09.512 --> 01:59:11.553]  Those are hardwired for our local stations.
[01:59:11.593 --> 01:59:16.114]  I can skip network ones for us, ourselves, and we lose money, but I don't even care anymore.
[01:59:16.995 --> 01:59:18.055]  I mean, this is just total war.
[01:59:18.075 --> 01:59:19.456]  People say, why do you have 14 minutes ads?
[01:59:19.976 --> 01:59:21.217]  That's how talk radio is.
[01:59:21.237 --> 01:59:21.837]  That's the average.
[01:59:22.537 --> 01:59:26.019]  And you notice I've been cutting most of the ads out for the network, leaving them for local stations.
[01:59:26.039 --> 01:59:29.160]  They've got to make money to pay their employees, keep their lights on, all of it.
[01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:31.801]  We're getting a lot of new affiliates, a lot of new listeners.
[01:59:32.262 --> 01:59:33.602]  People get what's happening.
[01:59:33.622 --> 01:59:34.323]  They understand it.
[01:59:34.423 --> 01:59:36.724]  And you're going to find out who the men are and who the boys are.
[01:59:37.024 --> 01:59:38.105]  Who the women, who the girls are.
[01:59:38.125 --> 01:59:40.566]  You're going to find out who has common sense and will.
[01:59:40.586 --> 01:59:42.407]  You're going to find out who's a sellout.
[01:59:42.928 --> 01:59:46.470]  This is what separates the weak from the chaff, the evil from the good.
[01:59:47.610 --> 01:59:52.913]  And again, I try to speed through the charging document and the recommendations.
[01:59:55.675 --> 01:59:57.396]  Is this Enrique or Dominic back on?
[01:59:59.083 --> 01:59:59.448]  It's both.
[01:59:59.549 --> 02:00:00.622]  Both of us are on here, Alex.
[02:00:01.244 --> 02:00:07.569]  Let me ask you both this question, and again, he's not being victimized like you, he's not asking for this, but just a microcosm.
[02:00:08.010 --> 02:00:09.231]  Now they're going after journalists.
[02:00:10.171 --> 02:00:12.874]  Owen Schroer was there with me, he tried to stop people going to the Capitol.
[02:00:13.414 --> 02:00:15.315]  So Enrique or Dominic first responded to this.
[02:00:15.836 --> 02:00:26.464]  In his sentencing recommendation, they want prison time, and they say because in May and August, he still said the election was stolen, and because he said that, they want jail time.
[02:00:26.705 --> 02:00:28.566]  This is completely illegal on its face.
[02:00:28.886 --> 02:00:29.647]  This is next level.
[02:00:29.667 --> 02:00:30.428]  What's your take on that?
[02:00:32.515 --> 02:00:37.923]  I still say the election is stolen.
[02:00:38.003 --> 02:00:39.425]  I always will say the election is stolen.
[02:00:39.445 --> 02:00:41.808]  You will never convince me that Joe Biden beat Donald Trump.
[02:00:41.928 --> 02:00:45.493]  In fact, you raised your fist at the end and said Trump won, I read.
[02:00:47.330 --> 02:00:48.591]  I sure did.
[02:00:48.631 --> 02:00:54.775]  Right after the judge handed me a 10-year sentence, I walked out of that courtroom, I put my fist in the air, and I said, Trump won and you all know it.
[02:00:55.195 --> 02:00:56.596]  And I said it right for the prosecutors.
[02:00:56.676 --> 02:00:57.617]  I said, everyone knows it.
[02:00:58.557 --> 02:01:02.260]  The thing is, it's not enough for these people just to beat us to trial and beat us in.
[02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:07.823]  They want us to walk out of that courtroom completely demoralized, completely beaten like a whipped dog with its tail between its legs.
[02:01:08.363 --> 02:01:09.764]  And that's what we can't do.
[02:01:09.824 --> 02:01:13.008]   We can't let them You can't let them defeat us spiritually.
[02:01:12.988 --> 02:01:15.307]  I mean that's the final battleground right there.
[02:01:15.307 --> 02:01:19.948]   And that's why they lied and said that you guys cried, but Joe Biggs cried, I'm confirming
[02:01:19.948 --> 02:01:23.387]   with court watchers, when he saw his daughter and said bye to his family.
[02:01:23.387 --> 02:01:24.948]  He didn't cry during the sentencing.
[02:01:24.948 --> 02:01:27.587]  He didn't cry during the sentencing.
[02:01:27.643 --> 02:01:32.025]  I cried when my wife was up there crying her eyes out, begging the judge to let me come home.
[02:01:32.065 --> 02:01:33.265]  You know, my daughter went up there.
[02:01:33.285 --> 02:01:34.425]  I haven't seen her in over a year.
[02:01:34.806 --> 02:01:36.166]  So yeah, I mean, I cried a little.
[02:01:36.686 --> 02:01:44.449]  I mean, what thing, like, compassionate man wouldn't after they see their family up there pleading to make their family whole again?
[02:01:44.489 --> 02:01:46.149]  So yeah, of course we shed a few tears.
[02:01:46.549 --> 02:01:46.949]  Who wouldn't?
[02:01:47.269 --> 02:01:47.830]  But you know what?
[02:01:47.850 --> 02:01:50.310]  We're not going to go out with our tail between our legs.
[02:01:50.330 --> 02:01:52.391]  We're not going to show them that they've whipped us spiritually.
[02:01:53.010 --> 02:01:56.454]  And I will say it to my dying breath, Trump won and everyone knows it.
[02:01:58.576 --> 02:02:03.701]  Alex, I want to hit that point with Owen for a second, and that's exactly what they're doing.
[02:02:03.761 --> 02:02:06.945]  If you do not comply, they're going to put you in chains.
[02:02:07.623 --> 02:02:09.164]  Okay, I'm going to give you the example.
[02:02:09.424 --> 02:02:12.005]  It's not a secret that I work with law enforcement.
[02:02:12.025 --> 02:02:13.586]  I mean, I used to say this on my podcast.
[02:02:13.966 --> 02:02:15.967]  I worked with law enforcement before these rallies.
[02:02:16.347 --> 02:02:26.473]  It'd be irresponsible of me to put a rally together not to contact local law enforcement and tell them, you know, if we're going with a permit, if we're not, where we're marching to.
[02:02:26.533 --> 02:02:27.993]  So that's not a secret.
[02:02:28.474 --> 02:02:36.574]   And when I came to D.C., I had a contact, a 24-year veteran lieutenant Head of Intelligence for the Metropolitan Police Department.
[02:02:36.594 --> 02:02:39.283]  Somebody that was my liaison every time I went to D.C.
[02:02:40.579 --> 02:02:43.981]  I knew I was communicating to keep people safe.
[02:02:44.061 --> 02:02:45.421]  That's my main objective.
[02:02:45.561 --> 02:02:49.383]  Bring everybody back home, have a good time, and make sure nobody's hurt.
[02:02:50.043 --> 02:03:02.649]  And I asked him to testify at my case because there was thousands of text messages of me helping them keep the streets safe from Antifa and BLM and keep both groups separated.
[02:03:03.289 --> 02:03:06.150]  And he said, yes, of course, I'm going to tell them the truth.
[02:03:06.670 --> 02:03:07.931]  So you know what happened to him, Alex?
[02:03:08.675 --> 02:03:17.799]  The FBI agents, in this case, went to his door, beat down his door and said, if you testify in this case, we are going to put you in jail.
[02:03:18.099 --> 02:03:19.480]  We are going to indict you.
[02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:23.782]  And his attorney called my attorney and was like, look, he can't testify anymore.
[02:03:24.082 --> 02:03:25.283]  He was my star witness.
[02:03:25.803 --> 02:03:27.324]  You know what they did to him after?
[02:03:28.876 --> 02:03:37.102]  They put him in jail anyways because he spoke publicly and he said, I was trying to keep people safe and I was trying to keep people away.
[02:03:37.162 --> 02:03:38.003]  That's what he wanted to say.
[02:03:38.143 --> 02:03:41.986]  And that's the lesson that even when you back down, they still come after you.
[02:03:42.026 --> 02:03:42.466]  Incredible.
[02:03:42.746 --> 02:03:45.728]  We're going to break here in a few minutes, hold you over the break, call back again if you can.
[02:03:45.748 --> 02:03:50.272]  But most important things, Enrique, Dominic, you want to say to the world listening right now?
[02:03:52.514 --> 02:03:53.054]  Tom, go ahead.
[02:03:54.451 --> 02:03:56.652]  Don't let them beat you.
[02:03:56.732 --> 02:04:00.994]  Like I said, even when things look bleak, don't stay strong in your beliefs.
[02:04:02.314 --> 02:04:04.475]  Like Trump always says, there's more of us than there is of them.
[02:04:04.495 --> 02:04:07.556]  Trump is a very, very smart man.
[02:04:07.916 --> 02:04:10.037]  He knows what he's talking about.
[02:04:10.057 --> 02:04:12.718]  They have the platform right now.
[02:04:12.738 --> 02:04:13.678]  They have the loudspeaker.
[02:04:13.698 --> 02:04:16.460]  That's why it seems like there's more of them than there is of us, but it's not that way.
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:17.820]  If we just stick together, we'll win.
[02:04:20.700 --> 02:04:34.415]  The American government right now, the Biden regime, has no right to criticize the Russian and the Chinese governments about how they treat dissidents and how much time they're giving to people for their free speech.
[02:04:34.796 --> 02:04:35.717]  They have no right.
[02:04:35.757 --> 02:04:37.239]  They lost the moral high ground.
[02:04:38.239 --> 02:04:41.741]  Of conditions in these prisons and these jails and how they've treated us.
[02:04:42.142 --> 02:04:43.242]  They have no right.
[02:04:43.623 --> 02:04:54.189]  We have, the Biden regime has lowered the standard of the American justice system to the point where we are no longer in competition with the Russian government and the Chinese government.
[02:04:54.549 --> 02:05:01.794]  Now we're treating our prisoners worse, worse, and we're jailing them for a lot less offenses, for a lot more.
[02:05:01.814 --> 02:05:03.254]  Okay?
[02:05:03.455 --> 02:05:04.515]  We're political prisoners.
[02:05:04.555 --> 02:05:05.296]  That's what we are.
[02:05:07.794 --> 02:05:08.375]  Absolutely.
[02:05:08.395 --> 02:05:10.617]  We're going to put this out later at Band Out Video.
[02:05:10.637 --> 02:05:12.139]  I'm going to put that clip of what he just said.
[02:05:12.159 --> 02:05:13.400]  We're political prisoners up front.
[02:05:13.741 --> 02:05:15.523]  Enrique Tarrio, we are political prisoners.
[02:05:16.003 --> 02:05:18.286]  The feds offered to release us to lie about Trump.
[02:05:18.806 --> 02:05:19.527]  Incredible.
[02:05:20.107 --> 02:05:21.889]  I want to get it right because I got it wrong.
[02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:23.791]  Tarrio, T-A-R-R-O.
[02:05:24.412 --> 02:05:34.754]  T-A-R-R-I-O familyfund.org, tariofamilyfund.org, and then Dominic Pozzola is givesendgo.com forward slash help dom.
[02:05:35.294 --> 02:05:39.995]  It is absolutely critical that you guys appeal this and that you be released.
[02:05:40.015 --> 02:05:41.916]  We got to get Trump elected to get you pardoned.
[02:05:42.196 --> 02:05:47.757]  Do you both believe, like Joe Biggs and I do as well, Trump says he will, that he's going to pardon the political prisoners of re-elected?
[02:05:50.536 --> 02:05:53.298]  I believe he is, and I won't ask him to pardon me.
[02:05:53.658 --> 02:05:56.241]  I'm asking him to look at the facts of the case, Alex.
[02:05:56.621 --> 02:06:06.850]  And when they look at the facts of the case, they're going to know that there's no other way to right a wrong and to actually get justice than to either pardon or commute our sentences.
[02:06:07.170 --> 02:06:08.572]  All right, gentlemen, both stay there.
[02:06:08.592 --> 02:06:10.033]  It's a four-minute break.
[02:06:10.434 --> 02:06:11.475]  We'll have like five minutes left.
[02:06:11.495 --> 02:06:13.778]  If you've got another person calling for you, we'll continue on.
[02:06:14.198 --> 02:06:18.604]  We'll be right back in a few minutes with American political prisoners, the American Gulag.
[02:06:18.904 --> 02:06:19.645]  This is incredible.
[02:06:19.705 --> 02:06:20.145]  Stay with us.
[02:06:21.087 --> 02:06:23.328]  You know, a little over a week ago I had Joe Biggs on.
[02:06:24.009 --> 02:06:29.112]  Hundreds of national stories all over ABC, NBC, CNN, all the corporate press.
[02:06:29.852 --> 02:06:33.574]  Twitter flooded saying, why are they allowed to speak?
[02:06:33.694 --> 02:06:35.675]  Why are they allowed to even call from jail?
[02:06:35.976 --> 02:06:38.617]  Oh, they'll be punished for it, but they have their time on the phone.
[02:06:40.158 --> 02:06:41.239]  Imagine the left now.
[02:06:41.299 --> 02:06:46.782]  They love putting people in jail for political action by the right wing, but they love violence by the left.
[02:06:48.166 --> 02:06:50.867]  And they just celebrate and say, why isn't Jones in prison?
[02:06:50.887 --> 02:06:51.707]  Why isn't he?
[02:06:52.668 --> 02:06:54.929]  And they're trying to put Trump in jail and they're doing all this.
[02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:57.510]  Well, they come after our guns and our children.
[02:06:58.050 --> 02:06:59.750]  It just goes on and on.
[02:06:59.811 --> 02:07:01.771]  I mean, this is really happening.
[02:07:03.392 --> 02:07:05.133]  And a lot of people think, well, I'll just keep my head down.
[02:07:05.173 --> 02:07:05.653]  I'll be fine.
[02:07:05.693 --> 02:07:06.413]  No, you won't be fine.
[02:07:06.573 --> 02:07:07.353]  They're coming after you.
[02:07:07.393 --> 02:07:09.334]  They've got to get through us first.
[02:07:09.354 --> 02:07:13.296]  And then I've got the sentencing recommendations by the feds against Owen Schroer.
[02:07:14.209 --> 02:07:19.711]  Who put tape over his mouth at the Capitol because they said no right wing protest the Capitol.
[02:07:19.792 --> 02:07:23.793]  Code Pink could take over events, yell and scream, chain themselves up, never put in jail.
[02:07:24.414 --> 02:07:26.415]  They would like arrest him and then release him outside.
[02:07:27.075 --> 02:07:29.416]  Owen puts a piece of tape over his mouth, in fact find that video.
[02:07:30.256 --> 02:07:31.097]  He's charged.
[02:07:32.239 --> 02:07:34.101]  And then does probation for it.
[02:07:34.521 --> 02:07:36.603]  So then they say, never go in the Capitol for three years.
[02:07:36.643 --> 02:07:40.567]  Well, he's outside the Capitol trying to keep folks going, and they use that to charge him.
[02:07:40.587 --> 02:07:43.210]  You can say, okay, well, that's a weird technicality.
[02:07:43.470 --> 02:07:47.114]  But then in the sentencing document, they say, he's unrepentant.
[02:07:48.007 --> 02:07:53.550]  In the summer of this year, years after January 6th, he said he still thinks the election was stolen.
[02:07:53.850 --> 02:07:55.791]  We're asking for jail time for his speech.
[02:07:56.411 --> 02:08:00.814]  Folks, that flies 100% against the First Amendment, all the federal rulings.
[02:08:01.134 --> 02:08:02.554]  In fact, Scott, I sent this to you.
[02:08:02.574 --> 02:08:03.635]  Maybe you gave it to the stack.
[02:08:04.055 --> 02:08:04.796]  It's probably here.
[02:08:05.196 --> 02:08:08.578]  I was in meetings until 40 minutes before the show, so I didn't go through it.
[02:08:09.858 --> 02:08:12.219]  But can you reprint just so I couldn't find it?
[02:08:12.239 --> 02:08:14.901]  Because I know I send you like 200 articles a day or more.
[02:08:15.572 --> 02:08:17.673]  When I got in here, I didn't have time to go through what I'd sent you.
[02:08:18.053 --> 02:08:25.057]  Can you reprint me Norm Pattis' response to their sentencing document?
[02:08:25.778 --> 02:08:27.439]  Because I sent it to you last night.
[02:08:27.459 --> 02:08:28.739]  I'll send it to you again.
[02:08:29.179 --> 02:08:29.620]  Here it is.
[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:30.940]  Because it's powerful.
[02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:45.163]   In fact, have Ben Stedham, Ben's the IT guy, have Ben Warren post this, I always confuse the two, have him post this in the In the upper area there.
[02:08:45.983 --> 02:08:47.524]  Or as its own article, you already have it right here.
[02:08:48.844 --> 02:08:49.424]  So here it is.
[02:08:50.205 --> 02:08:55.007]  This is United States District Court, District of Columbia.
[02:08:55.827 --> 02:08:58.609]  Mr. Schroer's reply to government sentencing memorandum.
[02:08:59.169 --> 02:09:01.250]  Have this posted on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:04.911]  Exclusive Owen Schroer's response to government's calls.
[02:09:07.433 --> 02:09:10.414]  Owen Schroer, or exclusive, Owen Schroer responds.
[02:09:13.922 --> 02:09:21.286]  To Fed's call for an... Fed's call for Owen Schroer's imprisonment for First Amendment, Owen Schroer response.
[02:09:22.486 --> 02:09:32.371]  Fed's call for journalist imprisonment for questioning 2020 election, Owen Schroer exclusive response.
[02:09:32.411 --> 02:09:33.012]  Something like that.
[02:09:33.632 --> 02:09:34.252]  That's what this is.
[02:09:34.372 --> 02:09:39.535]  Fed's call for imprisonment of journalists for First Amendment.
[02:09:42.501 --> 02:09:44.342]  Owen Schroyer's official response.
[02:09:45.283 --> 02:09:46.763]  Or a reporter's official response.
[02:09:47.444 --> 02:09:47.824]  This is it.
[02:09:47.864 --> 02:09:52.006]  And then you just publish under it the actual recommendation.
[02:09:52.026 --> 02:09:53.127]  I mean, you read this.
[02:09:53.147 --> 02:09:55.448]  I know they've been blocked from calling.
[02:09:55.468 --> 02:09:56.609]  As soon as they call back in, we'll get them on.
[02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:58.890]  You read this.
[02:10:00.471 --> 02:10:01.191]  And it's unreal.
[02:10:02.372 --> 02:10:03.153]  It says that.
[02:10:03.173 --> 02:10:03.713]  And I've shown it to you.
[02:10:03.733 --> 02:10:04.513]  I'm going to show it to you again.
[02:10:04.553 --> 02:10:05.694]  And I'm not going to hurry when I do it.
[02:10:05.714 --> 02:10:08.716]  I'm going to take time to actually go over it because I get hurried up.
[02:10:08.736 --> 02:10:09.736]  I want to read all this to you.
[02:10:10.096 --> 02:10:10.697]  I mean, this is like...
[02:10:11.817 --> 02:10:13.017]  30-something pages long.
[02:10:14.018 --> 02:10:14.918]  Yeah, 30 pages long.
[02:10:15.818 --> 02:10:21.820]  So, you read this and it doesn't, it sounds like what you heard about the Soviet Union or China today or North Korea.
[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:23.581]  It's like, this isn't Venezuela.
[02:10:23.901 --> 02:10:25.822]  They say, he is not repenting.
[02:10:25.862 --> 02:10:27.602]  He's still on air saying they stole the election.
[02:10:27.642 --> 02:10:28.402]  We want jail!
[02:10:30.863 --> 02:10:33.264]  And the left's like, he's still doing it on Twitter!
[02:10:33.524 --> 02:10:34.224]  Millions of views.
[02:10:34.564 --> 02:10:35.905]  We want jail now!
[02:10:37.506 --> 02:10:38.847]  What a freak show, man!
[02:10:38.927 --> 02:10:43.691]  I'm actually ashamed to be American that we have allowed this culture of evil to grow.
[02:10:43.951 --> 02:10:46.933]  I don't say put them in prison, but we should be confronting these people.
[02:10:46.953 --> 02:10:47.994]  And where's the ACLU?
[02:10:48.494 --> 02:10:48.855]  Nowhere.
[02:10:50.756 --> 02:10:54.399]  So we're going to publish Mr. Schroeder's reply to government sentencing memorandum.
[02:10:57.731 --> 02:11:04.733]  And then we are going to, it's full of all the federal precedent, and then we're going to, uh, they're back.
[02:11:05.313 --> 02:11:06.633]  And then after they're gone, I'll get into Owen.
[02:11:07.293 --> 02:11:15.795]  Okay, uh, whoever wants to go first, Dominic Pozzola at GibsonGo.com forward slash help Dom, or TarrioFamilyFund.org, Enrico Tarrio.
[02:11:16.176 --> 02:11:18.956]  You guys probably only have like 10 minutes left before they cut you off.
[02:11:19.496 --> 02:11:23.057]  You have the floor to say whatever you want, because we're still America here on the show.
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:33.545]  Well, first and foremost, I think that it's important for you guys to understand the gravity of the situation.
[02:11:33.605 --> 02:11:47.194]  I know that InfoWars listeners are more in tune with the truth than most other audiences, but I want to remind them how important this is and how pressing these issues are for this country.
[02:11:47.214 --> 02:11:54.739]  And I think it's actually not because I'm in here, not because I have a bias, you know, but this is the most pressing issue that we have in America today.
[02:11:57.140 --> 02:12:02.801]  The Constitution, our first, our very first amendment, the first thing that they thought of to put in there is free speech.
[02:12:03.302 --> 02:12:09.003]  And that very first constitutional amendment is the most precious that we have.
[02:12:09.703 --> 02:12:17.025]  And the reason why we have it is so we won't jail people with opinions, whether it's political, religious, doesn't matter what it is.
[02:12:17.585 --> 02:12:20.786]  And right here what we're seeing... Because that's the essence of tyranny.
[02:12:20.886 --> 02:12:21.966]  That's the essence of evil.
[02:12:22.728 --> 02:12:22.988]  That is.
[02:12:23.588 --> 02:12:23.908]  That is.
[02:12:24.108 --> 02:12:25.569]  And that's the first step.
[02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:27.509]  That's the first wall they have to break down.
[02:12:30.210 --> 02:12:34.971]  The Constitution is a perfect document, but the truth is, Alex, it doesn't exist.
[02:12:35.631 --> 02:12:35.891]  Okay?
[02:12:35.931 --> 02:12:38.732]  With the Biden regime, the Constitution doesn't exist.
[02:12:38.772 --> 02:12:39.492]  No, I agree.
[02:12:39.532 --> 02:12:41.092]  This is not the America we thought.
[02:12:41.132 --> 02:12:41.913]  It's already gone.
[02:12:41.933 --> 02:12:43.073]  We have to admit it's been taken.
[02:12:44.673 --> 02:12:45.654]  We have to, exactly.
[02:12:45.694 --> 02:12:47.015]  We have to admit it's been taken.
[02:12:47.515 --> 02:12:52.999]  We're here on a show, and you're on the line with somebody that got 22 years.
[02:12:53.119 --> 02:12:54.000]  I wasn't there.
[02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:58.883]  And the enemy is trying to put, I'm not going to interrupt you, but it's not just you guys.
[02:12:59.224 --> 02:13:00.925]  They're trying to put Owen in jail tomorrow.
[02:13:01.185 --> 02:13:02.766]  They're trying to shut me down right now.
[02:13:03.006 --> 02:13:05.708]  The point is, it's not that I'm whining, they're coming after everybody.
[02:13:05.768 --> 02:13:06.509]  This is desperate.
[02:13:07.267 --> 02:13:08.308]  Yes, yes.
[02:13:08.408 --> 02:13:12.110]  And you know, this isn't, this isn't, I want to say it.
[02:13:12.210 --> 02:13:19.596]  The judge that's going to be judging Mr. Schroeder tomorrow is the same judge that gave to us.
[02:13:19.736 --> 02:13:23.018]  So I don't think, I think this judge is doing what he wants to do.
[02:13:23.278 --> 02:13:25.840]  And again, I'm not, I'm not, he can do whatever he wants to do.
[02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:31.403]   I'm not trying to opine on his judgments, but I will say, you know, it was tough.
[02:13:31.423 --> 02:13:31.923]  It was tough.
[02:13:31.943 --> 02:13:33.883]  So I think it's going to be tough for Owen tomorrow.
[02:13:34.624 --> 02:13:35.324]  I'm praying for him.
[02:13:35.344 --> 02:13:36.484]  I'm going to pray for him tonight.
[02:13:36.544 --> 02:13:38.645]  But this isn't justice.
[02:13:38.685 --> 02:13:42.646]  What they're doing to us, what the government's doing in these cases, isn't justice.
[02:13:43.286 --> 02:13:46.127]  You know, we're being treated as animals.
[02:13:47.267 --> 02:13:49.168]  We're being treated as low lives.
[02:13:49.288 --> 02:13:52.769]  I mean, here, you've heard the horror stories about the D.C.
[02:13:52.889 --> 02:13:54.370]  Gulag, and it's not just D.C.
[02:13:54.990 --> 02:13:56.970]  It's the entire system treats us differently.
[02:13:57.471 --> 02:14:01.522]   And Alex, I hope the listeners know the gravity of this.
[02:14:01.882 --> 02:14:06.486]  We need you guys to take a bus, a bus with you to go vote in 2024.
[02:14:06.546 --> 02:14:12.752]  Because, you know, everybody's voting for their own conscience, for like the economy, for things to get better.
[02:14:13.553 --> 02:14:14.734]  For us, it's our life.
[02:14:15.735 --> 02:14:16.315]  It's our life.
[02:14:16.395 --> 02:14:22.661]  And by the way, the left admits what they're doing to you is a microcosm of what they want to do to the entire country.
[02:14:24.369 --> 02:14:25.229]  Yeah, they're next.
[02:14:25.650 --> 02:14:26.090]  They're next.
[02:14:26.330 --> 02:14:27.991]  You know, I don't want that to happen to them.
[02:14:28.511 --> 02:14:31.052]  I don't want this to happen to liberals, but it will happen to us.
[02:14:31.072 --> 02:14:32.092]  Enrique, let me ask you this.
[02:14:32.212 --> 02:14:34.073]  I said you'd have the floor, but this is so important.
[02:14:34.573 --> 02:14:36.314]  You sound stronger than when I knew you.
[02:14:36.354 --> 02:14:40.476]  You sound like more empowered now.
[02:14:40.876 --> 02:14:41.436]  What's happened?
[02:14:41.456 --> 02:14:42.257]  You sound strong.
[02:14:43.877 --> 02:14:44.238]  I am.
[02:14:44.258 --> 02:14:47.579]  I am angry, Alex, and it started with anger.
[02:14:48.064 --> 02:14:51.747]  It started with anger, and it started with depression, you know?
[02:14:51.767 --> 02:14:53.329]  I'm like, wow, why am I here?
[02:14:53.749 --> 02:14:54.510]  Why am I here?
[02:14:54.910 --> 02:14:59.474]  And the more I asked myself that question, the more I was able to answer that question for myself.
[02:14:59.854 --> 02:15:02.797]  And today I stand for you a lot stronger than I was before.
[02:15:03.517 --> 02:15:04.798]  A lot more resilient.
[02:15:05.518 --> 02:15:06.679]  I'm not going to give up.
[02:15:06.879 --> 02:15:07.680]  This isn't the end.
[02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:12.060]   the end. This isn't the end. Yeah, Ray Epps has New York Times pub pieces about him. He
[02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:15.409]  said in text messages, "I orchestrated it." He said, "Go in."
[02:15:15.409 --> 02:15:20.939]   He rams signs in. You didn't do that. You weren't even there. And this man that "orchestrated"
[02:15:20.939 --> 02:15:25.829]   it is worshipped by the New York Times. Yeah, and there's two things that keep
[02:15:25.829 --> 02:15:26.819]  me going, Alex.
[02:15:27.043 --> 02:15:28.484]  Well, three things that keep me going.
[02:15:28.524 --> 02:15:30.666]  And number one is my God and my faith.
[02:15:31.407 --> 02:15:34.109]  And number two is my family that has been here with me.
[02:15:34.169 --> 02:15:38.912]  My mother, my father, my fiance, my aunt, my sister, my entire family.
[02:15:38.932 --> 02:15:41.354]  And number three, it's people like you, Alex.
[02:15:41.454 --> 02:15:45.638]  People like the listeners of InfoWars and people that have supported us.
[02:15:46.018 --> 02:15:52.363]  Because you guys, once we're gone through our federal holding, you guys are our only voice.
[02:15:52.955 --> 02:15:56.079]  I'm not going to be able to do this in a federal facility because they don't allow it.
[02:15:56.119 --> 02:15:57.181]  They don't want that free speech.
[02:15:57.221 --> 02:15:58.522]  They don't want the truth to get out.
[02:15:58.943 --> 02:16:01.386]  So it's you guys that are going to keep us alive out here.
[02:16:01.426 --> 02:16:02.968]  And I thank you guys every day.
[02:16:03.289 --> 02:16:05.512]  I thank you and your listeners every day for doing that.
[02:16:05.872 --> 02:16:08.796]  And I encourage you to keep going because we don't want to be forgotten.
[02:16:09.378 --> 02:16:12.839]  We don't want to be the forgotten few that people talk about every once in a while.
[02:16:12.899 --> 02:16:15.961]  I don't want to be just like... No, we're not going to forget you, brother, and I want to be clear.
[02:16:15.981 --> 02:16:25.004]  I haven't had you guys on or sought you out or done this because the lawyers all said, don't antagonize the system, wait, because they were, I think, a little bit duped.
[02:16:25.324 --> 02:16:27.225]  But now that this has happened, we're here to support you.
[02:16:28.826 --> 02:16:30.248]  I'm going to back you up on that, Alex.
[02:16:30.408 --> 02:16:33.691]  I haven't done any interviews and I've been trying to stay under the radar.
[02:16:34.012 --> 02:16:39.017]  I wanted the justice process to play out exactly how it played out without me being out there.
[02:16:39.117 --> 02:16:40.498]  So, yes, I appreciate that.
[02:16:40.598 --> 02:16:42.981]  And yes, what you're saying is 100 percent accurate.
[02:16:43.021 --> 02:16:44.382]  Well, I'm not a victim like you.
[02:16:44.443 --> 02:16:45.624]  I'm just saying people attack me.
[02:16:45.644 --> 02:16:46.345]  Where's Enrique?
[02:16:46.365 --> 02:16:46.785]  Where are they?
[02:16:47.225 --> 02:16:48.767]  The lawyers are like, don't have him on.
[02:16:48.847 --> 02:16:49.848]  And I was like, OK.
[02:16:51.670 --> 02:16:52.590]  Definitely, definitely.
[02:16:52.610 --> 02:16:54.852]  And don't say that you're not a victim, Alex, because you are.
[02:16:55.232 --> 02:16:55.652]  You are.
[02:16:56.112 --> 02:16:56.913]  Well, we're not a victim.
[02:16:56.933 --> 02:16:58.413]  We're not going to victimize ourselves.
[02:16:59.054 --> 02:16:59.674]  No, I get it.
[02:16:59.714 --> 02:17:05.857]  But compared to you guys, all I'm saying is you're the front line because they're so scared of a pro-human deal.
[02:17:06.817 --> 02:17:11.600]  They're so scared of somebody to stand up defensively to anti-vote because that's the only thing that stands in their way.
[02:17:13.361 --> 02:17:14.201]  Amen, amen.
[02:17:14.221 --> 02:17:15.282]  Here's Dom for you, Alex.
[02:17:15.382 --> 02:17:20.184]  Yeah, and just like Enrique was saying, they are coming for all of us, all of us on our side.
[02:17:21.045 --> 02:17:26.568]  I mean, before the election, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said they're making a list of Trump supporters and they're going to come after all of us.
[02:17:26.588 --> 02:17:28.529]  She wasn't lying when she said that.
[02:17:28.609 --> 02:17:32.150]  They laid out their plan right there, right there, plane and day for us.
[02:17:32.170 --> 02:17:33.471]  They're coming after all of us.
[02:17:33.491 --> 02:17:34.611]  They hate the Constitution.
[02:17:34.651 --> 02:17:35.392]  They're destroying it.
[02:17:35.412 --> 02:17:36.012]  They're spreading it.
[02:17:36.032 --> 02:17:38.673]  This government is completely tyrannical.
[02:17:38.953 --> 02:17:43.555]  And I mean, people need to realize that this is bigger than just one election.
[02:17:44.076 --> 02:17:48.658]  This is our freedom, our lives, our kids' lives, our future generations.
[02:17:49.537 --> 02:17:50.778]  This is a whole shebang here.
[02:17:51.079 --> 02:17:54.542]  I mean, we gotta get it right this time or there won't be another time to do it.
[02:17:54.361 --> 02:17:59.200]   do it. Well that's the thing and Owen's only facing you know 120 days to a year
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:03.120]   but the point is is that they've moved on to the next group now they're moving
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:06.200]   on to the journalist and they get away with that it'll be five years in jail
[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:10.001]   for a journalist I mean where are the journalists saying this is dangerous?
[02:18:10.001 --> 02:18:13.801]  Yeah well there are most of them already on it that's why.
[02:18:13.801 --> 02:18:18.740]   But you know like one of our lawyers said like Norm Pattis said I think he said that the only thing that
[02:18:18.740 --> 02:18:22.121]   this system is doing is and martyrs of us.
[02:18:21.619 --> 02:18:24.821]  And I think it's really, it's opened a lot of eyes to see.
[02:18:25.702 --> 02:18:31.065]  I heard just recently some crazy leftist ran over a teenage MAGA kid and killed him on purpose.
[02:18:31.085 --> 02:18:31.926]  Only got five years.
[02:18:32.146 --> 02:18:33.067]  Only got five years.
[02:18:33.087 --> 02:18:37.430]  He admittedly ran him over because he was a Trump supporter and ran over the body repeatedly.
[02:18:38.763 --> 02:18:43.304]  So, you know, I hate to say that we're martyrs, but I think at least it's opening some eyes.
[02:18:43.864 --> 02:18:44.685]  Hopefully it continues.
[02:18:44.545 --> 02:18:45.545]  building.
[02:18:45.545 --> 02:18:50.905]   So, you know, I hate to say that we're martyrs, but I think at least it's opening some eyes
[02:18:50.905 --> 02:18:51.905]  to hopefully it continues.
[02:18:51.905 --> 02:18:55.904]   And, you know, this is not the country any of us want to live in.
[02:18:55.904 --> 02:19:01.744]   I mean, we're we're we're we're kind of showing North Korea and China how it's done right
[02:19:01.744 --> 02:19:02.744]  now with what we're doing.
[02:19:02.744 --> 02:19:07.263]  Yeah, they'll get pointers from the from the Biden regime.
[02:19:07.263 --> 02:19:11.985]   Kim Jong Un right now is writing notes on how to treat prisoners and how to how to jail
[02:19:11.985 --> 02:19:12.985]  dissidents.
[02:19:12.985 --> 02:19:16.745]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:19:16.294 --> 02:19:33.705]  You guys are reporting from in Mordor, from in the prison they want to put the whole country in, and again a man that admits he ran over a Trump supporter who did nothing, who he chased, and rammed him down, then ran back over him, crushing his head and torso.
[02:19:34.145 --> 02:19:36.726]  The judge said, I know you meant well, but you've got to get five years.
[02:19:37.527 --> 02:19:39.148]  These are sick people.
[02:19:39.188 --> 02:19:40.849]  They believe violence against us is okay.
[02:19:42.390 --> 02:19:43.510]  This is so dangerous.
[02:19:44.699 --> 02:19:47.325]  It's all of us next as you guys are in that black hole.
[02:19:48.588 --> 02:19:49.891]  You've got appeals coming up.
[02:19:50.492 --> 02:19:51.515]  How do we support you?
[02:19:54.312 --> 02:20:05.818]  Alex, and you said it right, you know, I think supporting us, and I hate to say this, supporting us is the most important thing, the most important thing that there is right now in the American system.
[02:20:06.258 --> 02:20:20.906]  I don't want, I didn't want to be this example, but 22 years, 18 years, 17 years, 10 years, these appeals are more important than ever because, and I'm going to talk directly to your listeners here, you guys that are listening, you know, you're next.
[02:20:21.946 --> 02:20:23.347]  How long before you sit?
[02:20:24.088 --> 02:20:32.578]  On a bunk and look at a concrete wall for hours on end and they don't let you out of yourself for three days so you can take a 15 minute shower.
[02:20:33.198 --> 02:20:34.960]  You know, how long before it's you?
[02:20:35.361 --> 02:20:39.826]  And I'm telling you, it's not long before that happens.
[02:20:40.242 --> 02:20:49.895]  No, and we were in the holding cell down in the courtroom with the individuals that got arrested for protesting at the Parkfield Burst Abortion Convention in D.C.
[02:20:50.095 --> 02:20:52.038]  And those guys are looking at 10 years also.
[02:20:55.162 --> 02:20:58.065]  They're outlawing being common sense pro-America.
[02:20:58.566 --> 02:21:01.429]  And again, I read the judge's ruling and the kid they killed.
[02:21:01.809 --> 02:21:07.616]  The judge said, I'm sorry, I know you're a good person, but you have to get five years, which in a state you only serve about two or three.
[02:21:08.036 --> 02:21:11.320]  The judge apologized to the guy that murdered a Trump supporter.
[02:21:12.842 --> 02:21:14.363]  Yeah, that's the problem.
[02:21:14.403 --> 02:21:20.481]   A lot of these judges and prosecutors Yeah, and Alex, you asked me how to support, how you support us.
[02:21:20.501 --> 02:21:21.902]  There's three ways to support us.
[02:21:21.761 --> 02:21:27.761]   If I could ask the audience to do something, I would say, please, get a hold of your congressmen.
[02:21:27.761 --> 02:21:28.761]  I know Congress is weak.
[02:21:28.761 --> 02:21:29.761]  They always have been weak.
[02:21:29.761 --> 02:21:34.161]   We need to get a hold of them and say, look, we need to start investigating these judges
[02:21:34.161 --> 02:21:39.161]   for what they've done to us since January 6th of these cases because it's been an atrocity.
[02:21:39.161 --> 02:21:44.561]  And Alex, you asked me how to support us.
[02:21:44.561 --> 02:21:45.841]  There's three ways to support us.
[02:21:45.841 --> 02:21:48.081]  Number one, I ask your audience for prayers.
[02:21:48.390 --> 02:21:49.653]  You know, and I ask you for prayers.
[02:21:50.655 --> 02:21:53.262]  The whole InfoWars team, because I pray for you guys all the time.
[02:21:53.854 --> 02:21:57.736]  You know, I pray for Owen, I pray for you, Alex, I pray for, you know, everybody that's out there.
[02:21:57.756 --> 02:22:08.700]  And second, um, the way that you could support us is, um, you know, our financially, you know, I've never asked, I haven't, through this whole process, I haven't asked anybody for a single dollar, okay?
[02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:10.781]  Um, now I'm drained, okay?
[02:22:10.801 --> 02:22:23.326]  I'm drained and I need it for appeals and we need to hire the best of colored attorneys because my case and the case of the guys here are probably the most important case that'll free as many J6ers as possible if it gets overturned at any moment.
[02:22:23.886 --> 02:22:26.109]  And the third way is exactly what Dom said.
[02:22:26.129 --> 02:22:42.367]  Members of Congress, Major Taylor Greene, you know, I'm not the biggest fan of McCarthy, but you know, I know that he has to do what he has to do, but McCarthy, we're asking you, we're asking the committee led by Jim Jordan, the Weaponization Committee, I ask them to subpoena me.
[02:22:42.568 --> 02:22:44.430]  I have so much more information for you guys.
[02:22:47.042 --> 02:22:48.523]  I'm not allowed to share with the public.
[02:22:48.903 --> 02:22:50.344]  Absolutely, that's key.
[02:22:50.404 --> 02:22:54.167]  I heard from Biggs though that the guards and the prisoners know you're innocent.
[02:22:54.187 --> 02:22:55.108]  That's unprecedented.
[02:22:55.468 --> 02:22:56.949]  Can you speak to that before they cut you off?
[02:22:58.666 --> 02:22:59.486]  Yes, and the U.S.
[02:22:59.546 --> 02:23:02.327]  Marshals, the guards, and everybody are very, very supportive.
[02:23:02.387 --> 02:23:03.208]  They've seen it.
[02:23:03.268 --> 02:23:04.328]  I mean, this is their job.
[02:23:04.348 --> 02:23:09.730]  They see this every day and they're like, what they're doing to you is, excuse my language, it's fucked up.
[02:23:10.170 --> 02:23:10.570]  You know?
[02:23:11.110 --> 02:23:16.432]  I haven't run into one other inmate or one other correctional officer who thinks what they're doing to us is fair.
[02:23:17.433 --> 02:23:18.353]  They all think it's atrocious.
[02:23:21.817 --> 02:23:28.520]  Outside of my, after my sentence, the marshals prayed with me and they said that they've never seen anything like this.
[02:23:28.620 --> 02:23:35.703]  One of them worked in that jail, in that courtroom for 25 years, and he says that he's never seen anything like this.
[02:23:36.183 --> 02:23:43.286]  That he thought I was gonna get like three years, four years, just like everybody else, but when the judge handed down a 22-year sentence, his heart stopped.
[02:23:44.606 --> 02:23:45.527]  Let's be clear, Enrique.
[02:23:46.590 --> 02:23:48.512]  You, you, you, I mean, I know you guys.
[02:23:48.552 --> 02:23:50.353]  You were worried about antifa bombing the hotel.
[02:23:50.793 --> 02:23:52.174]  You were there in case antifa attacked us.
[02:23:52.214 --> 02:23:53.635]  You guys don't attack police.
[02:23:54.036 --> 02:23:55.217]  I mean, we went to Georgia in peace.
[02:23:55.237 --> 02:23:56.638]  We went to the Capitol with the state police.
[02:23:56.958 --> 02:23:58.579]  They said it was a dry run for our attack.
[02:23:59.140 --> 02:24:00.320]  We don't attack police.
[02:24:00.361 --> 02:24:01.421]  That's not what you do.
[02:24:01.722 --> 02:24:02.442]  It's not what I do.
[02:24:02.502 --> 02:24:03.343]  It's ridiculous.
[02:24:05.069 --> 02:24:05.429]  We don't.
[02:24:05.449 --> 02:24:13.358]  We support that and obviously from the messages and all the evidence in my trial, you can see that we supported police all the way through.
[02:24:13.758 --> 02:24:17.002]  You know, I don't support police officers that shot into the crowd that day.
[02:24:17.062 --> 02:24:18.683]  I can't tell you that I support that.
[02:24:19.064 --> 02:24:25.691]  But law enforcement is something that we always cherished.
[02:24:26.229 --> 02:24:34.935]  You know, we're worried about, you know, Antifa, some of the BLM rioters and things like that, that, you know, we're actually hurting Trump supporters.
[02:24:35.496 --> 02:24:37.517]  And that's what we're there to do.
[02:24:37.557 --> 02:24:38.298]  We're very good.
[02:24:38.658 --> 02:24:40.680]  We're very good at defending, and that's why we're in.
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:42.101]  Well, just tell them you're with Ray Epps.
[02:24:42.121 --> 02:24:46.424]  Tell them you're with Ray Epps, and then you can say you orchestrated it and go in and attack, and you'll be fine.
[02:24:47.512 --> 02:24:49.195]  Yep, yep, that's all we gotta do.
[02:24:49.275 --> 02:24:53.303]  All we gotta do is stick to their script and we won't be in jail.
[02:24:53.343 --> 02:24:56.609]  All I had to do was- You have one minute remaining.
[02:24:57.512 --> 02:24:59.933]  All I had to do was turn on Trump and I wouldn't be in jail.
[02:25:00.013 --> 02:25:02.894]  All I had to do was be like Ray Epps and I wouldn't be in jail.
[02:25:03.154 --> 02:25:05.935]  All I had to do was praise Biden and I wouldn't be in jail.
[02:25:05.955 --> 02:25:07.135]  But you know what?
[02:25:07.416 --> 02:25:08.616]  That's not what I did.
[02:25:09.016 --> 02:25:13.898]  I praised Trump and I praised the United States of America and our constitutional values and you know what?
[02:25:14.198 --> 02:25:18.239]  I'm sitting here and I'm paying for it and I'll tell you I'm doing it with a freaking smile on my face.
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:18.900]  Okay?
[02:25:18.980 --> 02:25:22.521]  And I'm going to continue to do it as long as it takes for all of us to come home.
[02:25:23.752 --> 02:25:27.455]  Dominique Pozzola, Enrique Tarrio, I am proud of you guys.
[02:25:27.515 --> 02:25:28.655]  I'm so sad this happened.
[02:25:28.675 --> 02:25:29.996]  You are the tip of the spear for us.
[02:25:30.437 --> 02:25:32.198]  We're going to get you out of there legally and lawfully.
[02:25:32.218 --> 02:25:33.319]  We're going to get Trump elected.
[02:25:33.819 --> 02:25:36.501]  And the deep state will be removed from power.
[02:25:37.001 --> 02:25:41.885]  People need to go to givecingo.com forward slash help dom, which nobody's donating to him.
[02:25:41.905 --> 02:25:42.785]  They really should, folks.
[02:25:42.985 --> 02:25:44.767]  And tarriofamilyfund.org.
[02:25:44.807 --> 02:25:45.447]  You want us to fight?
[02:25:45.467 --> 02:25:47.008]  You want men to fight politically?
[02:25:47.068 --> 02:25:47.649]  It's standing for you.
[02:25:47.669 --> 02:25:48.129]  They're doing it.
[02:25:48.449 --> 02:25:51.471]  Gentlemen, 30 seconds, 20 seconds before they cut you off.
[02:25:51.511 --> 02:25:52.032]  Final comments.
[02:25:53.772 --> 02:25:54.032]  All right.
[02:25:54.252 --> 02:25:54.792]  Love you guys.
[02:25:54.853 --> 02:25:55.333]  Thank you guys.
[02:25:55.373 --> 02:25:57.954]  Thank you guys for supporting us and keep supporting us.
[02:25:57.793 --> 02:26:14.192]  Thank you for using Global Telink.
[02:26:15.142 --> 02:26:16.603]  But you want somebody to fight, right?
[02:26:17.903 --> 02:26:30.883]   The American people, and I use this microcosm example a lot, Anheuser-Busch lost 40 plus billion dollars in the stock market for promoting pedophile crap.
[02:26:31.463 --> 02:26:31.683]  Great!
[02:26:32.684 --> 02:26:33.124]  Let it happen.
[02:26:34.225 --> 02:26:36.306]  They lost a billion dollars in sales so far.
[02:26:38.187 --> 02:26:44.010]  Imagine instead of a boycott, and I still say boycott them, you did a boycott and you supported people.
[02:26:44.030 --> 02:26:45.030]  And I know most of you are.
[02:26:45.050 --> 02:26:49.573]  And I'm not bitching, I'm just saying, we are toe-to-toe with this thing.
[02:26:49.853 --> 02:26:53.675]  This is cutting your energy off, coming after your children, trying to sterilize them.
[02:26:54.701 --> 02:26:55.662]  This is a total takeover.
[02:26:57.283 --> 02:26:59.525]  And I can't help it.
[02:26:59.725 --> 02:27:03.848]  I mean, I know it makes me more of a target to be against World War III.
[02:27:04.529 --> 02:27:06.450]  And more of a target to have these guys on.
[02:27:06.470 --> 02:27:09.472]  Everybody loved the attacks.
[02:27:10.813 --> 02:27:12.074]  Oh, Jones, this is important.
[02:27:12.094 --> 02:27:12.675]  January 6th, people.
[02:27:12.735 --> 02:27:13.355]  He's not having them on.
[02:27:14.136 --> 02:27:15.437]  Because their lawyers didn't want them on.
[02:27:16.138 --> 02:27:16.638]  You heard that.
[02:27:16.678 --> 02:27:18.019]  You heard Enrique say, yeah, that's true.
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:19.440]  That was their strategy.
[02:27:20.301 --> 02:27:29.552]   So now that they're falsely convicted, For crimes they didn't commit, and we should have the A-Team, you know, intro here, going out of the hour, looks like they do that, pulling the A-Team outro.
[02:27:30.814 --> 02:27:31.114]  I'm here.
[02:27:32.875 --> 02:27:45.867]  But there's nothing worse, just like a Batman, the Dark Knight deal, where you know you're doing the right thing, you're able to keep your mouth shut, even though they're getting attacked, like, fine, yeah, I'm not supporting them, even though I was saying it's wrong, what happened to them, and all that, they're like, listen, they're gonna punish them for what you say.
[02:27:46.428 --> 02:27:46.868]  Don't do it.
[02:27:47.609 --> 02:27:49.711]  And then they put in a filing against Owen Schroeder.
[02:27:51.138 --> 02:27:54.459]  That they want present time for him because of his speech.
[02:27:55.499 --> 02:27:58.080]  And I asked Owen last night, I said, you're going to host a show, you want to do this?
[02:27:58.120 --> 02:27:59.621]  He said, I want to see what they do to me first.
[02:28:01.401 --> 02:28:02.341]  And they're the men in the arena.
[02:28:02.382 --> 02:28:05.162]  You can't second guess what they're doing when they're the men in the arena.
[02:28:05.222 --> 02:28:06.603]  They're the men being targeted at the point.
[02:28:06.863 --> 02:28:07.963]  And you know you're next.
[02:28:08.303 --> 02:28:09.864]  They're being fed in the wood chipper, you're next.
[02:28:11.482 --> 02:28:13.644]  Enrique's like, oh no, you're a victim too, you've been persecuted.
[02:28:13.664 --> 02:28:19.929]  Yeah, I mean, I haven't talked about 10% of what they've done to me, but I already know they're bad people.
[02:28:20.009 --> 02:28:20.690]  I asked for this.
[02:28:21.790 --> 02:28:22.251]  I did this.
[02:28:22.311 --> 02:28:23.872]  I rolled my sleeves up a long time ago.
[02:28:24.933 --> 02:28:27.475]  So, it is what it is.
[02:28:28.076 --> 02:28:30.938]  But all I ask for is not your sorrow, not your sympathy.
[02:28:30.958 --> 02:28:35.882]  I ask for your prayers, and I ask for your support financially and by word of mouth.
[02:28:35.902 --> 02:28:37.964]  Because let me tell you, I'm the real deal.
[02:28:39.144 --> 02:28:40.425]  And my ancestors were the real deal.
[02:28:41.065 --> 02:28:42.586]  And I got the genetics just like you got.
[02:28:42.606 --> 02:28:43.426]  That's why you're tuned in.
[02:28:43.686 --> 02:28:45.507]  Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young.
[02:28:45.947 --> 02:28:46.927]  You come from good people.
[02:28:48.428 --> 02:28:50.729]  And that's why you can't serve evil.
[02:28:50.769 --> 02:28:52.350]  You just can't when it's cut and dry.
[02:28:52.610 --> 02:28:54.271]  You may do something bad when you weren't thinking about it.
[02:28:54.291 --> 02:28:55.571]  You feel sorry for it later.
[02:28:55.951 --> 02:29:05.736]  But you can't when it's all lit up, like Las Vegas, and the choices are so clear, you can't make the wrong decision.
[02:29:05.776 --> 02:29:08.577]  And that's what separates God's people from the devil's people.
[02:29:11.055 --> 02:29:13.858]  Because the devil's people, they want to join it.
[02:29:15.820 --> 02:29:18.883]  They think they're the winners and they're cool because they serve darkness.
[02:29:20.084 --> 02:29:22.747]  And so, I don't enjoy what I got to go through at one level.
[02:29:23.768 --> 02:29:24.248]  My flesh.
[02:29:25.256 --> 02:29:34.360]  Man, I want to go watch football games and drink beer and play pool and go, you know, water skiing and camping and fishing and, you know, go to Mexico and go to Europe.
[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:36.220]  I mean, I don't want to fight people.
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:37.841]  I don't want to take on the New World Order.
[02:29:37.881 --> 02:29:41.162]  But they're coming after kids, sterilizing them, taking parental rights.
[02:29:41.182 --> 02:29:42.463]  They're shipping fentanyl in.
[02:29:42.483 --> 02:29:43.663]  They're human smuggling.
[02:29:43.683 --> 02:29:44.744]  They're starting World War III.
[02:29:45.044 --> 02:29:47.545]  And I'm just like, man, I got to fight this as a man.
[02:29:47.665 --> 02:29:49.666]  I mean, because if I don't, I'm with them.
[02:29:50.984 --> 02:29:52.504]  That's what people that sit on the fence don't get.
[02:29:52.865 --> 02:29:55.045]  God said, you were hot or cold, I spit you out of my mouth.
[02:29:55.485 --> 02:29:56.806]  You're gonna serve evil, that's what you did.
[02:29:56.826 --> 02:29:57.966]  At least God respects you.
[02:29:58.406 --> 02:29:59.347]  Bible says it, it's true.
[02:30:00.427 --> 02:30:02.007]  Yeah, you serve evil, you know what you're doing?
[02:30:02.187 --> 02:30:03.368]  You chose the side, all right?
[02:30:03.988 --> 02:30:07.389]  But to everybody out there that sits there and plays games, God doesn't like you.
[02:30:07.849 --> 02:30:11.390]  God likes you worse than Satan, because you're a damn coward.
[02:30:15.051 --> 02:30:16.452]  This hour already went by, oh my God.
[02:30:17.500 --> 02:30:20.181]  We've got a guest host coming up, Gerald Salenti.
[02:30:20.201 --> 02:30:21.361]  But I've got to take 15 minutes.
[02:30:21.901 --> 02:30:23.062]  I've got to finish up with this.
[02:30:24.502 --> 02:30:25.142]  We'll be right back.
[02:30:25.182 --> 02:30:25.623]  Stay with us.
[02:30:25.703 --> 02:30:26.363]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:26.403 --> 02:30:27.363]  Infowars.com.
[02:30:27.383 --> 02:30:28.043]  Tomorrow is Tuesday.
[02:30:28.323 --> 02:30:29.204]  And this is great, guys.
[02:30:29.224 --> 02:30:31.624]  I don't want the A-Team audio intro.
[02:30:31.644 --> 02:30:34.105]  I want the A-Team original TV intro.
[02:30:34.125 --> 02:30:35.506]  When we come back, you can get it.
[02:30:36.886 --> 02:30:37.526]  We'll be right back.
[02:30:37.505 --> 02:30:44.505]  men convicted of a crime they didn't commit.
[02:30:54.505 --> 02:31:00.145]   Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really good
[02:31:00.145 --> 02:31:00.505]  news.
[02:31:00.604 --> 02:31:05.329]  Because it's a great product you love, and people want it, and it funds our operation of 360WIN.
[02:31:05.789 --> 02:31:07.772]  BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:31:08.132 --> 02:31:09.634]  The strongest you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:31:10.234 --> 02:31:17.598]  Jam-packed, a big ol' giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation, that empowers your neurological system, you name it.
[02:31:17.638 --> 02:31:19.619]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[02:31:19.659 --> 02:31:20.460]  God gave it to us.
[02:31:20.920 --> 02:31:22.641]  And it's the strongest curcuminoid out there.
[02:31:23.101 --> 02:31:25.723]  Other leading brands are like 70% curcuminoid.
[02:31:26.583 --> 02:31:28.524]  Most brands are 5% cumidin.
[02:31:28.905 --> 02:31:30.806]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[02:31:31.186 --> 02:31:32.947]  This is the strongest anybody makes.
[02:31:34.027 --> 02:31:35.829]  95% curcuminoid.
[02:31:36.149 --> 02:31:37.509]  I am so glad this is back.
[02:31:38.690 --> 02:31:40.091]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[02:31:40.531 --> 02:31:42.591]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[02:31:43.472 --> 02:31:44.912]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:31:45.252 --> 02:31:46.013]  Back in stock 25% off.

[02:31:57.992 --> 02:31:59.992]  Come on, Paul Bailey! Wow!
[02:31:59.897 --> 02:32:02.478]  The replatforming begins now.
[02:32:02.438 --> 02:32:06.438]  Join Mug Club and get one month free with promo code "Alex"
[02:32:06.438 --> 02:32:09.938]   at JonesCrowder.com 10 years ago a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a
[02:32:09.938 --> 02:32:17.438]  military court for a crime they didn't commit.
[02:32:17.438 --> 02:32:19.438]  Commit.
[02:32:18.466 --> 02:32:22.548]  These men promptly escaped from maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground.
[02:32:23.189 --> 02:32:26.591]  Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
[02:32:26.850 --> 02:32:32.850]   If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team.
[02:32:32.850 --> 02:32:41.850]  So that's a cheesy 1980s show.
[02:32:41.662 --> 02:32:42.723]  We're not calling for violence.
[02:32:43.124 --> 02:32:44.945]  We're calling for word of mouth, prayer, and money.
[02:32:44.965 --> 02:32:46.946]  You want somebody to fight for you?
[02:32:46.967 --> 02:32:48.007]  You don't want to roll over and die?
[02:32:48.027 --> 02:32:51.590]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, have we not delivered?
[02:32:52.130 --> 02:32:53.752]  We have been toe-to-toe with these people.
[02:32:54.152 --> 02:32:56.214]  We have blown so many of their operations.
[02:32:56.934 --> 02:32:58.756]  That's why they hate our guts.
[02:32:59.676 --> 02:33:00.377]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:01.378 --> 02:33:03.779]  Well, the system's coming after us with everything they got.
[02:33:04.080 --> 02:33:05.060]  And I'm not going to give up.
[02:33:05.481 --> 02:33:06.041]  I can't give up.
[02:33:06.381 --> 02:33:09.304]  But, you know, I hope I'm not just some sick form of entertainment.
[02:33:10.325 --> 02:33:11.546]  Like Trump with all these indictments?
[02:33:12.166 --> 02:33:15.409]  And now Trump's been crying at these events and breaking down for the first time?
[02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:17.750]  Because he's so emotional, he's so committed.
[02:33:17.790 --> 02:33:18.931]  It's not weakness, it's strength.
[02:33:22.313 --> 02:33:24.755]  And that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:25.916 --> 02:33:26.597]  That's where we are.
[02:33:27.217 --> 02:33:28.498]  Gerald Solinte takes over at 15 after.
[02:33:28.638 --> 02:33:30.099]  We'll skip that break so he has more time.
[02:33:30.739 --> 02:33:40.018]   I'm going to hit Owen Schroer's federal sentencing requirement, federal sentencing recommendation, because The articles about it are bad.
[02:33:40.178 --> 02:33:41.659]  They're nothing compared to the document.
[02:33:42.519 --> 02:33:46.101]  They're not just saying they're trying to put him in jail for his speech on January 6th.
[02:33:47.461 --> 02:33:48.762]  They say he's not remorseful.
[02:33:48.842 --> 02:33:50.482]  He still says the election's stolen.
[02:33:50.923 --> 02:33:55.545]  They're saying they're doing it because of what he said.
[02:33:57.606 --> 02:33:59.566]  This precedent is gargantuan.
[02:34:00.147 --> 02:34:01.627]  This precedent is colossal.
[02:34:03.688 --> 02:34:05.209]  It's gigantic.
[02:34:05.409 --> 02:34:07.430]  It's absolutely huge.
[02:34:09.028 --> 02:34:16.031]  And again, I don't know how when somebody attacks you to roll over.
[02:34:16.452 --> 02:34:17.152]  I've never done it.
[02:34:18.152 --> 02:34:22.374]  I don't know how the average person thinks rolling over to this is going to get them ahead.
[02:34:22.634 --> 02:34:23.535]  It's not, folks.
[02:34:24.275 --> 02:34:27.057]  And it's going to inspire a lot of people that see the tyranny to say no.
[02:34:27.917 --> 02:34:33.019]  And like I said in the first hour, we can't sit here when everybody starts joining us and say, well, they didn't used to be with us.
[02:34:33.359 --> 02:34:34.160]  They must be evil.
[02:34:35.506 --> 02:34:35.686]  No.
[02:34:36.406 --> 02:34:38.007]  Not everybody's Ted Nugent or Alex Jones.
[02:34:38.027 --> 02:34:38.907]  Not everybody's Ron Paul.
[02:34:38.927 --> 02:34:40.588]  Not everybody's T. Edward Griffin.
[02:34:40.888 --> 02:34:46.651]  Not everybody has, day one, got all this and been basically pure from the beginning.
[02:34:47.851 --> 02:34:49.732]  We've all learned in the process we've made mistakes.
[02:34:49.772 --> 02:34:52.893]  But yeah, you can sit back and say, well, who's always been the same?
[02:34:53.153 --> 02:34:58.095]  Who was, day one, from the minute they showed up in the political scene, was, you know, top gun?
[02:34:58.556 --> 02:34:59.436]  There's not many of those.
[02:34:59.536 --> 02:35:03.958]  And I don't judge people because they didn't have family that educated them when they were a child like mine.
[02:35:05.478 --> 02:35:16.306]  If I didn't have my family that was in Iran, Contra, and CIA mind control, and all the people go, oh look, he got a secret clip, Jones admits his family.
[02:35:16.566 --> 02:35:18.948]  Yeah, folks, I already told you that a long time ago.
[02:35:19.628 --> 02:35:23.971]  And my family broke with it and spoke out against it and said it was wrong.
[02:35:24.191 --> 02:35:28.755]  And so because I had them, I was able to know what was happening before it happened.
[02:35:29.355 --> 02:35:39.483]  So then, just like I had family that worked for the system and didn't know, who broke with it, I see people that work for the system and are breaking with it now as good.
[02:35:41.365 --> 02:35:42.606]  And that's what it comes down to.
[02:35:42.666 --> 02:35:44.628]  We have to be ready to win.
[02:35:45.268 --> 02:35:47.330]  We have to be ready to say no.
[02:35:47.390 --> 02:35:55.997]  We have to be ready to take the reins of power from the out-of-control, psychotic, degenerate bureaucracy that is an enemy of humanity.
[02:35:58.464 --> 02:35:59.688]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:01.313 --> 02:36:03.820]  And that's where I stand, and it's where I'm always going to stand.
[02:36:04.821 --> 02:36:09.443]  When I get up here and tell you the things I know, it's not to impress you.
[02:36:09.843 --> 02:36:12.185]  Like when I tell you I was involved in abortions, it's to repent.
[02:36:12.965 --> 02:36:22.890]  Like the abortion doctor I sent you guys, and I didn't see it in my list, if I don't get it today, just write a note where the doctor testifies to Congress about murdering babies.
[02:36:23.110 --> 02:36:25.711]  And he says, I'm sorry, I was wrong, God touched my heart.
[02:36:26.111 --> 02:36:27.972]  We appreciate him going public.
[02:36:28.213 --> 02:36:30.674]  We don't reject him now that he's telling the truth.
[02:36:31.274 --> 02:36:34.115]  Because I can sit here and say I've been politically truthful from the start.
[02:36:34.135 --> 02:36:35.796]  I've been on the right team from the beginning.
[02:36:35.896 --> 02:36:36.956]  Most people don't get to do that.
[02:36:37.616 --> 02:36:41.377]  Like Darth Vader was on the right team, then the wrong team, then the right team at the end.
[02:36:41.718 --> 02:36:42.558]  As an analogy.
[02:36:44.498 --> 02:36:46.899]  But when it comes to politics, I've been on the right team the whole time.
[02:36:46.919 --> 02:36:49.860]  But I personally have done devilish stuff.
[02:36:50.140 --> 02:36:51.481]  But Christ has forgiven me.
[02:36:52.001 --> 02:36:53.261]  And I have been transmuted.
[02:36:53.541 --> 02:36:54.762]  My sins have been forgiven.
[02:36:55.776 --> 02:36:56.416]  We'll be right back.
[02:36:56.516 --> 02:36:57.677]  Infowars.com.
[02:36:57.957 --> 02:36:59.218]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:36:59.718 --> 02:37:03.200]  But I am calling on the Darth Vader's of the world to join us now.
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:07.061]  Join me, and I will complete your training.
[02:37:07.902 --> 02:37:10.063]  Final segment coming to you from ATX.
[02:37:11.283 --> 02:37:11.624]  U.S.
[02:37:11.664 --> 02:37:14.605]  stay-behind network in Texas defending the Republic.
[02:37:15.786 --> 02:37:17.726]  Coming to you from occupied territory.
[02:37:18.407 --> 02:37:19.727]  You in command base Austin.
[02:37:20.428 --> 02:37:21.088]  In our bunker.
[02:37:22.149 --> 02:37:22.749]  I am your host.
[02:37:24.278 --> 02:37:26.040]  And quite frankly, I wouldn't rather be anywhere else.
[02:37:26.700 --> 02:37:27.701]  It's good to be on the right side.
[02:37:28.702 --> 02:37:29.222]  Good to be with you.
[02:37:32.085 --> 02:37:40.272]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to finish up with this as I mentioned earlier before the great Gerald Celente takes over, because this has really caught people's attention.
[02:37:40.292 --> 02:37:41.693]  There's hundreds of news articles about it.
[02:37:42.033 --> 02:37:53.761]   Reportedly, tomorrow, after his sentencing in the morning, there's going to be 50 news cameras out there at the federal Kangaroo Court facility there at the federal courthouse.
[02:37:54.762 --> 02:38:10.200]   But here is the United States District Court, the District of Columbia, United States of America v. Jonathan Owen Schroer, and it is a 30-page document, and in it they openly say, And nobody's picked up on this.
[02:38:10.220 --> 02:38:13.241]  They pick up, oh, we want jail time for what he said on January 6th.
[02:38:13.541 --> 02:38:14.341]  The election's stolen.
[02:38:14.361 --> 02:38:15.442]  We have a tyrannical government.
[02:38:16.222 --> 02:38:17.223]  Joe Biden's a pedophile.
[02:38:17.243 --> 02:38:18.403]  People are like, wow, that's incredible.
[02:38:18.703 --> 02:38:27.587]  No, they say we want him put in jail for what he has currently said in the last month and a half.
[02:38:28.687 --> 02:38:30.468]  And they give exhibits for that.
[02:38:30.508 --> 02:38:32.009]  Now, he was first arrested right here.
[02:38:33.803 --> 02:38:40.225]  When they said conservatives aren't allowed to protest even signs of the Capitol, he put a piece of tape over his mouth saying censored.
[02:38:41.185 --> 02:38:44.606]  They let kids sing pro-globalist songs right in front of him.
[02:38:45.106 --> 02:38:45.866]  That was okay.
[02:38:45.926 --> 02:38:47.346]  While he did it, they weren't arrested.
[02:38:48.307 --> 02:38:48.947]  He was.
[02:38:50.807 --> 02:38:52.968]  He went on probation for it.
[02:38:54.164 --> 02:38:57.527]  And because he was outside the capital of me, they then charged him.
[02:38:57.787 --> 02:38:59.548]  He said, okay, well that's their technical excuse.
[02:38:59.929 --> 02:39:05.453]  Now they say no, it's about his speech on January 6th, before and after.
[02:39:06.414 --> 02:39:08.435]  Unprecedented evil.
[02:39:09.316 --> 02:39:11.117]  Arrested for a silent protest.
[02:39:11.418 --> 02:39:11.998]  Here's the video.
[02:39:12.078 --> 02:39:13.519]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see it.
[02:39:13.919 --> 02:39:16.121]  We'll repost it at InfoWars.com, a live show feed.
[02:39:18.263 --> 02:39:19.524]  So let's go back to this document.
[02:39:21.107 --> 02:39:24.208]  Let's flip to the pages here, because there's a lot of this, but I want to get this right on record.
[02:39:25.249 --> 02:39:26.589]  This is on January 6th.
[02:39:27.229 --> 02:39:28.770]  They're going to say he broke through barriers.
[02:39:28.830 --> 02:39:29.490]  Did not do that.
[02:39:29.530 --> 02:39:30.370]  Should have, but they're broken down.
[02:39:31.051 --> 02:39:32.711]  They say he told people to attack the Capitol.
[02:39:32.751 --> 02:39:33.192]  No, he didn't.
[02:39:33.232 --> 02:39:34.012]  He said don't do it.
[02:39:35.793 --> 02:39:43.315]  We will not accept the fake election of child molester Joe Biden, that Chinese Communist agent Joe Biden, and we know where he belongs.
[02:39:43.936 --> 02:39:44.896]  And it's not in the White House.
[02:39:47.497 --> 02:39:50.078]  They're going to say this is him on Band.Video.
[02:39:54.142 --> 02:39:57.226]  Sawyer breaches the perimeter and enters the west side of the Capitol.
[02:39:57.646 --> 02:39:58.327]  Totally open.
[02:39:58.347 --> 02:39:58.788]  We go in.
[02:39:58.828 --> 02:40:00.430]  We have a permanent event.
[02:40:00.670 --> 02:40:01.651]  We're going over there.
[02:40:02.192 --> 02:40:02.632]  They lie.
[02:40:06.797 --> 02:40:08.119]  Now, they get into this later.
[02:40:09.858 --> 02:40:12.619]  They lie and say the police tried to stop us.
[02:40:12.659 --> 02:40:14.039]  No, they said, please help stop it.
[02:40:14.199 --> 02:40:14.819]  We have it on video.
[02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:27.143]  After several attempts and no positive response from police with this request, which they admit was to stop, they say person one, that's me, to let me on their speaker system to tell me not to go on the Capitol.
[02:40:28.737 --> 02:40:35.765]  After several attempts and no positive response from the police, this request, the group decides to just get up there.
[02:40:36.506 --> 02:40:42.432]  Now, I had the police, we have it on video, we've not released it, it's on body cam, they're going off, said it was public.
[02:40:43.213 --> 02:40:45.315]  I said, yeah, go up, use your First Amendment to stop it.
[02:40:45.796 --> 02:40:49.220]  So we have you, it's been given to everybody, it's ready to be released as soon as you try your crap.
[02:40:51.786 --> 02:40:53.847]  They're going to say various chants including USA and 7076.
[02:40:54.067 --> 02:40:56.068]  You gotta get a hold of the crowd.
[02:40:56.428 --> 02:40:58.529]  You gotta get them to listen to you.
[02:40:58.549 --> 02:40:59.949]  7076, America first.
[02:41:00.029 --> 02:41:00.930]  Now let's leave.
[02:41:01.010 --> 02:41:01.830]  Do not go in.
[02:41:02.090 --> 02:41:03.110]  You've all seen the videos.
[02:41:03.130 --> 02:41:03.971]  We've released that part.
[02:41:08.472 --> 02:41:10.153]  We just want to send a peaceful message.
[02:41:11.434 --> 02:41:12.174]  Is what Owen said.
[02:41:13.473 --> 02:41:14.374]  With the building behind him.
[02:41:14.614 --> 02:41:18.376]  So they quote him saying, we're just here peaceful, leave the Capitol.
[02:41:18.756 --> 02:41:19.857]  That is part of his crime.
[02:41:20.738 --> 02:41:23.239]  You've all seen the video of me, the videos, you all know this.
[02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:27.362]  We helped thousands not get in, they wanted to set up and put in new logs.
[02:41:27.682 --> 02:41:32.765]  Some didn't even touch a police officer, walked through velvet ropes, they waved them in, three years in prison.
[02:41:34.567 --> 02:41:34.947]  Here's page 14.
[02:41:35.067 --> 02:41:47.490]   On January 17, 2021 on the InfoWars broadcast, now we're Shroyer stated that he realized something about January 6th, Exhibit 15, May 15th, InfoWars broadcast.
[02:41:47.851 --> 02:42:01.880]  While downplaying the, yeah, January 6th got a little out of hand, they weren't burning down buildings or shooting cops, yeah, there was some violence against the police, there was a little bit of violence in the building, too, property damage, Shroyer stated that January 6th, like a mouse that roared.
[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:09.787]   Compared to Democrats' riot, Exhibit 15, 17, InfoWars broadcast, At 0021 minutes.
[02:42:10.247 --> 02:42:19.156]  He went on to say, we should have rejected their narrative on January 6th, and frankly, at a certain level, we shouldn't have been proud of it.
[02:42:19.556 --> 02:42:25.602]  We should have been proud of what happened on January 6th, but they stole that from us, meaning protesting peacefully.
[02:42:25.923 --> 02:42:26.964]  They cut it out of context.
[02:42:30.598 --> 02:42:30.878]  Page 18.
[02:42:32.019 --> 02:42:37.764]  Notably, for a misdemeanor defendant like Owen Schroer, the absence of violent, destructive acts is not a mitigating factor.
[02:42:38.064 --> 02:42:41.647]  Had Owen Schroer engaged in such conduct, he would have faced additional charges.
[02:42:42.048 --> 02:42:43.349]  So he's innocent makes him bad.
[02:42:43.689 --> 02:42:50.695]  Schroer cannot light a fire with a can of gasoline and then express concerns of disbelief when it explodes.
[02:42:50.775 --> 02:42:53.377]  Even when Ray Epps and the Democrats and the D.C.
[02:42:53.417 --> 02:42:54.178]  police break in.
[02:42:54.218 --> 02:42:55.019]  So it's all his fault.
[02:42:57.745 --> 02:42:58.285]  Page 20.
[02:42:59.025 --> 02:43:02.607]  Schroer's words and criminal actions surrounded by January 6th are inexpressibly intertwined.
[02:43:03.407 --> 02:43:09.389]  Imposed a sentence of incarceration would not punish Schroer for his beliefs of any associations.
[02:43:09.449 --> 02:43:12.611]  It would punish him for appropriate, and they give the U.S.
[02:43:12.631 --> 02:43:12.891]  Code.
[02:43:14.111 --> 02:43:19.553]  Finally, his statements and actions after January 6th illustrate his complete lack of remorse.
[02:43:20.013 --> 02:43:46.542]   To date, despite a number of opportunities he has taken to speak about the election of January 6th, they go on, see he's questioning the election, He has yet to sincerely demonstrate genuine, this is the most important part, finally, his statements and actions of January 6th illustrate his complete lack of remorse for doing nothing to date, despite a number of opportunities he has taken to speak about the election of January 6th.
[02:43:47.003 --> 02:43:48.084]  So they're watching his show.
[02:43:49.127 --> 02:43:54.309]  He is not the communist Chinese, not the children being run across the border, not the fentanyl they're watching you.
[02:43:54.869 --> 02:44:01.251]  He has yet to sincerely demonstrate genuine remorse for his conduct, for doing nothing, except being a hero trying to stop folks going in.
[02:44:01.931 --> 02:44:16.356]  As recently as August 28th, 2023, Schreuer continued to spread the conspiracy theories around the 2020 presidential election on his internet show, on a bunch of radio stations, you name it, streaming program for anyone with a computer to watch.
[02:44:17.341 --> 02:44:21.104]  How evil that Donald Trump won the 2020 election.
[02:44:21.324 --> 02:44:30.910]  So they are saying, we want jail time for him saying they won, Trump won the 2020 election.
[02:44:30.950 --> 02:44:34.613]  So he has yet to sincerely demonstrate genuine remorse for his conduct.
[02:44:35.373 --> 02:44:42.678]  As recently as August 28, 2023, Troyer continued to spread the conspiracy theories around 2020 presidential election.
[02:44:42.698 --> 02:44:46.121]  So it's not his right to do that on his internet streaming program.
[02:44:47.148 --> 02:44:53.474]  For anyone with a computer to watch it, that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election and he will win 2024.
[02:44:54.035 --> 02:44:56.958]  Oh my God, he will win 2024?
[02:44:57.458 --> 02:44:58.359]  That's even worse.
[02:44:58.980 --> 02:45:01.382]  Unless there is a fraud like there was previously.
[02:45:02.403 --> 02:45:13.050]   In the sum, the court can hold and should consider the defendant's statements and conduct in determining an appropriate sentence which
[02:45:13.050 --> 02:45:19.150]   should include incarceration in light of the nature and the circumstances of his offense.
[02:45:19.150 --> 02:45:23.829]   Which they just said was Trump had it stolen, the American people had it stolen, and they're
[02:45:23.829 --> 02:45:24.790]  going to try it again.
[02:45:25.146 --> 02:45:28.768]  Totally, 100% protected.
[02:45:29.088 --> 02:45:30.408]  And it gets worse after that.
[02:45:31.189 --> 02:45:39.152]  Out of the hundreds of articles I've scanned over, no one says, they go, oh, since he said it was stolen before January 6th, they want jail time.
[02:45:39.432 --> 02:45:39.592]  No.
[02:45:39.912 --> 02:45:54.744]   Currently on his show, in 2023, In May, June, and July and August, they say we want jail because he's going forward with the lie that Trump won.
[02:45:54.965 --> 02:45:56.766]  He could say Trump was made out of cheese.
[02:45:57.326 --> 02:45:59.068]  He could say Trump was Santa Claus.
[02:45:59.448 --> 02:46:01.029]  He could say Trump was Mary Poppins.
[02:46:01.449 --> 02:46:02.190]  That's not true.
[02:46:03.330 --> 02:46:05.012]  But clearly it was stolen.
[02:46:05.432 --> 02:46:06.913]  Clearly there's all this intimidation.
[02:46:07.233 --> 02:46:08.854]  And clearly they've indicted the President.
[02:46:09.195 --> 02:46:13.878]  And now they're looking at Owens saying, he said this, Your Honor, we want jail time.
[02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:17.681]  Don't you get it, folks?
[02:46:17.701 --> 02:46:18.401]  These are lawyers.
[02:46:19.001 --> 02:46:20.062]  They can do this to Owen.
[02:46:20.302 --> 02:46:21.263]  You're the target.
[02:46:21.543 --> 02:46:22.404]  What does Biden say?
[02:46:22.664 --> 02:46:23.384]  White supremacists.
[02:46:23.664 --> 02:46:24.785]  Voter questioners.
[02:46:25.245 --> 02:46:26.206]  Lockdown questioners.
[02:46:26.266 --> 02:46:26.946]  They're the terrorists.
[02:46:26.966 --> 02:46:27.587]  We gotta get them.
[02:46:28.717 --> 02:46:34.479]  They are openly setting the precedent with this to take all of your rights and all of your freedoms.
[02:46:35.359 --> 02:46:40.181]  This is so over the top, but it's the next phase of their operation.

[02:46:52.666 --> 02:46:55.267]  Gerald Cilente for the Balance of the Hour takes over now.
[02:46:55.287 --> 02:46:55.787]  Thank you, Gerald.
[02:46:56.884 --> 02:46:57.324]  Thank you.
[02:46:57.344 --> 02:46:59.785]  This is so sad what you're talking about, my God.
[02:47:00.705 --> 02:47:11.688]  You know, doing this to Owen, how about bringing little Georgie Bush to trial?
[02:47:12.548 --> 02:47:14.868]  Allying us into the Iraq War?
[02:47:15.148 --> 02:47:17.369]  Hey, no, Salenti, what are you talking about?
[02:47:17.709 --> 02:47:18.669]  Don't you know who he is?
[02:47:18.729 --> 02:47:19.909]  Don't you know who his daddy was?
[02:47:20.250 --> 02:47:22.310]  Don't you know who his granddaddy was?
[02:47:23.230 --> 02:47:26.131]  Owen, hey, Owen doesn't have, he's not a member of the club.
[02:47:26.960 --> 02:47:28.441]  Let's go after him for nothing.
[02:47:29.121 --> 02:47:30.002]  Start wars?
[02:47:31.703 --> 02:47:33.283]  How about that guy Bill Clinton?
[02:47:33.824 --> 02:47:35.565]  Every time he got caught with his pants down.
[02:47:35.625 --> 02:47:37.065]  Bombs away over Baghdad.
[02:47:37.726 --> 02:47:39.887]  Oh, how about Madeline Not All That Bright?
[02:47:40.787 --> 02:47:41.688]  On 60 Minutes.
[02:47:42.448 --> 02:47:43.349]  Leslie Stahl.
[02:47:44.029 --> 02:47:48.572]  Saying, yeah, what Bill Clinton did that killed over 500,000 Iraqi children.
[02:47:48.632 --> 02:47:49.932]  Asked if it was worth the price.
[02:47:50.313 --> 02:47:51.653]  She said, yes, it's worth the price.
[02:47:51.994 --> 02:47:53.474]  Don't bring them up on trial.
[02:47:53.494 --> 02:47:55.736]  I mean, what are you doing to this guy?
[02:47:56.016 --> 02:47:56.396]  For what?
[02:47:57.765 --> 02:47:58.486]  Am I next?
[02:47:59.567 --> 02:48:00.467]  Is Alex next?
[02:48:01.088 --> 02:48:01.748]  Are you next?
[02:48:04.250 --> 02:48:05.932]  Look what happened with the COVID war.
[02:48:06.793 --> 02:48:21.124]  Anything that you said that disagreed with what the government was saying and the little boys and girl clowns that repeat the crap coming out of their mouth, you believe in misinformation.
[02:48:22.566 --> 02:48:26.729]  What they're doing to Owen is disgusting.
[02:48:29.076 --> 02:48:30.737]  And again, who's next?
[02:48:32.918 --> 02:48:33.218]  Me?
[02:48:34.258 --> 02:48:34.959]  What did he do?
[02:48:36.159 --> 02:48:36.840]  What did he do?
[02:48:39.141 --> 02:48:39.621]  Did nothing.
[02:48:42.042 --> 02:48:42.703]  Disagree?
[02:48:44.824 --> 02:48:45.984]  With what they're doing to us?
[02:48:48.605 --> 02:48:54.928]  And again, when you watch that whole thing on January 6th, the guards are letting everybody in.
[02:48:56.969 --> 02:48:58.210]  What's going on over here?
[02:48:58.738 --> 02:49:00.959]  Oh, and they shot that woman?
[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:02.980]  Killed the dead?
[02:49:06.102 --> 02:49:07.843]  That's okay, that's okay!
[02:49:08.804 --> 02:49:14.527]  We can kill anybody that we want in any country at any time, any place, anywhere!
[02:49:14.547 --> 02:49:18.829]  Now I'm going to tell you what happened with me on election night.
[02:49:20.270 --> 02:49:22.671]  I was doing USA Watchdog with Greg Hunter.
[02:49:23.371 --> 02:49:26.313]  And he had all this data coming in, he had all these sheets coming in.
[02:49:27.428 --> 02:49:28.469]  And this is what it looked like.
[02:49:28.509 --> 02:49:31.090]  It was Trump like this and Biden underneath.
[02:49:31.991 --> 02:49:52.403]  As it's going on, going on, and all of a sudden, like, so all of you bureaucrats out there, all you lowlifes over there that will go after a guy like me that had tuned in now to InfoWars, this is what I said during election night.
[02:49:54.306 --> 02:50:04.413]  All of a sudden, I forget where it was from, either Wisconsin, Michigan, all of a sudden like 110,000 votes come in, not one for Biden, for Trump, not one.
[02:50:06.074 --> 02:50:11.918]  And then it comes in another one, another 140, 100,000, whatever, not one for Trump.
[02:50:13.719 --> 02:50:15.180]  And again, I'm not a Trump supporter.
[02:50:15.880 --> 02:50:17.101]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[02:50:17.501 --> 02:50:18.662]  I'm a political atheist.
[02:50:19.182 --> 02:50:21.324]  I look at things the way they are, not the way I want them to be.
[02:50:24.124 --> 02:50:26.066]  And I'm saying to myself, what am I, six years old?
[02:50:26.086 --> 02:50:27.607]  There can't be one vote for this guy.
[02:50:29.448 --> 02:50:31.330]  Oh, oh, they don't rig elections.
[02:50:31.750 --> 02:50:39.557]  Hey, did you ever hear of those hanging chads down in Florida that brought little Georgie Bush in?
[02:50:40.978 --> 02:50:43.760]  Oh, how about JFK?
[02:50:45.201 --> 02:50:55.246]   Oh, and Daley was, uh, The head of Chicago in most Illinois that they say rigged the vote so he beat Nixon?
[02:50:55.286 --> 02:50:56.086]  No, no, no.
[02:50:56.866 --> 02:50:57.847]  Let's send him to jail.
[02:50:57.887 --> 02:51:00.307]  Anybody that disagrees with you, send them to jail.
[02:51:01.947 --> 02:51:03.328]  This is terrible what's going on.
[02:51:04.608 --> 02:51:07.009]  And everybody listening, get this in your head.
[02:51:07.029 --> 02:51:09.049]  You better do something.
[02:51:09.869 --> 02:51:11.890]  Anything you can to support InfoWars.
[02:51:12.490 --> 02:51:12.870]  Anything.
[02:51:13.710 --> 02:51:14.110]  Anything.
[02:51:15.190 --> 02:51:16.130]  Because they're next.
[02:51:16.891 --> 02:51:17.431]  I'm next.
[02:51:17.891 --> 02:51:18.631]  And you're next.
[02:51:20.492 --> 02:51:22.294]  And you know what your next is going to be?
[02:51:25.316 --> 02:51:29.460]  When they get us into World War Three, quote, officially.
[02:51:32.842 --> 02:51:33.783]  It's already there.
[02:51:35.305 --> 02:51:39.248]  Even now, over in Ukraine, they're saying World War Three's begun.
[02:51:39.268 --> 02:51:42.511]  Yeah, we only said this when it began on February 24, 2022.
[02:51:46.434 --> 02:51:48.976]  They're robbing us of our freedom in front of our eyes.
[02:51:49.476 --> 02:51:50.136]  What is this?
[02:51:50.477 --> 02:51:52.038]  We're going to have to open for what?
[02:51:52.798 --> 02:51:55.180]  What did he do?
[02:51:55.220 --> 02:51:56.240]  Misinformation.
[02:51:57.181 --> 02:51:58.422]  And again, what Alex just read.
[02:51:59.022 --> 02:52:00.083]  What are you talking about?
[02:52:00.503 --> 02:52:11.428]   How about bringing How about bringing all of these politicians that vote for war, that kill people, how about bringing them up on murder charges?
[02:52:12.168 --> 02:52:16.910]  I want to see little Georgie Bush brought up on murder charges.
[02:52:17.330 --> 02:52:20.011]  I want to see Clinton brought up on murder charges.
[02:52:20.291 --> 02:52:20.551]  Hey!
[02:52:21.431 --> 02:52:23.292]  Out of the mouth of Hillary Clinton!
[02:52:25.393 --> 02:52:32.199]   When asked, how do you feel that Muammar Gaddafi He's been killed.
[02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:33.540]  We came.
[02:52:34.680 --> 02:52:35.481]  We saw.
[02:52:36.281 --> 02:52:36.901]  He died.
[02:52:36.921 --> 02:52:38.042]  Hee hee hee hee.
[02:52:42.804 --> 02:52:43.044]  Yeah.
[02:52:44.384 --> 02:52:45.125]  That's fine.
[02:52:45.765 --> 02:52:46.945]  That's fine.
[02:52:47.486 --> 02:52:51.527]  As long as you promote war and hate, you're okay.
[02:52:53.088 --> 02:52:54.809]  You speak about peace and love.
[02:52:54.829 --> 02:52:58.210]  Here they are.
[02:52:59.051 --> 02:52:59.811]  War criminals.
[02:53:00.819 --> 02:53:02.200]  Of the first degree.
[02:53:04.001 --> 02:53:05.502]  One after another.
[02:53:07.544 --> 02:53:07.744]  Yep.
[02:53:09.605 --> 02:53:14.869]  These are the people running and ruining our lives right in front of our eyes.
[02:53:18.231 --> 02:53:19.452]  Look what's going on now.
[02:53:19.472 --> 02:53:21.333]  Again.
[02:53:22.594 --> 02:53:27.818]  How they sell hate, fear and hysteria, but it's all about the bottom line.
[02:53:28.962 --> 02:53:32.945]  Whether it's the military industrial complex or the big corporations.
[02:53:34.507 --> 02:53:36.168]  You got this story over here.
[02:53:36.368 --> 02:53:37.069]  What did I do with it?
[02:53:39.070 --> 02:53:41.052]  In today's Wall Street Journal.
[02:53:44.815 --> 02:53:46.336]  Vietnam, U.S.
[02:53:46.436 --> 02:53:48.158]  strengthened diplomatic ties.
[02:53:50.219 --> 02:53:58.026]  Biden in Hanoi visits secures pact putting America on the same rung as China, Russia?
[02:54:00.353 --> 02:54:00.893]  The U.S.
[02:54:00.994 --> 02:54:05.837]  entered a new and strengthened diplomatic partnership with Vietnam.
[02:54:05.857 --> 02:54:08.059]  Yep.
[02:54:11.482 --> 02:54:14.244]  I'm of the Vietnam War era age.
[02:54:15.245 --> 02:54:16.846]  I'm prime draft meat.
[02:54:21.590 --> 02:54:24.713]  Every day I'd wake up and they're gonna get me, they're gonna get me, they're gonna get me.
[02:54:24.973 --> 02:54:33.324]   And, to make this clear, I was too stupid To see what a lie this war was.
[02:54:34.264 --> 02:54:39.546]  I believe the crap spewing out of the mouths of the politicians.
[02:54:40.186 --> 02:54:49.209]  Because as Richard Nixon, another war monger, said, the American people don't believe anything until they see it on television.
[02:54:50.949 --> 02:55:08.116]   And a CIA slob, William J. Casey, the jerk, that's the J, off is the other word, We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.
[02:55:09.597 --> 02:55:10.937]  He said that in 1981.
[02:55:11.077 --> 02:55:20.023]  So going back to the Vietnam War, the only reason I didn't want to go is I'm seeing these guys walking through water like this with all this weight on their back with their guns over there getting shot at.
[02:55:20.523 --> 02:55:21.484]  That's why I didn't want to go.
[02:55:22.444 --> 02:55:24.686]  So now we make this deal with Vietnam, right?
[02:55:26.013 --> 02:55:28.235]  Who's your president, girls and boys?
[02:55:28.896 --> 02:55:31.799]  Oh, the draft dodger in Vietnam!
[02:55:32.239 --> 02:55:34.041]  Oh, we love those commies!
[02:55:34.982 --> 02:55:36.903]  Those dirty, rotten commies!
[02:55:37.344 --> 02:55:40.827]  If we don't stop them, those dominoes are going to keep falling.
[02:55:41.768 --> 02:55:44.911]  And before you know it, all of Asia will be communist.
[02:55:45.271 --> 02:55:48.554]  And then there'll be dominoes will fall on the shores of California.
[02:55:48.855 --> 02:55:49.996]  That's the crap they made up.
[02:55:50.951 --> 02:55:53.312]  And you know the guy over there?
[02:55:53.932 --> 02:55:54.973]  Biden goes there?
[02:55:54.993 --> 02:55:56.333]  To Vietnam?
[02:55:57.074 --> 02:55:57.974]  Oh yeah, Vietnam?
[02:55:58.374 --> 02:56:03.656]  Who now supplies America our second largest importer of clothing and shoes?
[02:56:04.597 --> 02:56:05.337]  That Vietnam?
[02:56:05.357 --> 02:56:06.798]  Because they got cheap labor?
[02:56:10.459 --> 02:56:12.140]  Draft Dodger Biden!
[02:56:13.100 --> 02:56:13.501]  You ready?
[02:56:17.902 --> 02:56:19.023]  Got Biden over here.
[02:56:21.581 --> 02:56:27.744]  Biden received five student draft deferments and a medical exemption.
[02:56:28.824 --> 02:56:30.585]  What, for being out of his mind?
[02:56:31.185 --> 02:56:33.146]  No, no, no.
[02:56:34.066 --> 02:56:43.390]  Biden not only received deferments for his undergraduate days at the University of Delaware, but for three years of law school at Syracuse University.
[02:56:44.810 --> 02:56:56.004]   When his education deferments expired in 1968, Biden requested deferments based on the fact that he had asthma as a teenager.
[02:56:58.065 --> 02:57:07.867]  This guy, I don't know, the guy who wrote this article is Lawrence J. Corb, K-R-O-B, January 21st, 2021.
[02:57:09.427 --> 02:57:25.502]   He goes on to say he did this in spite of the fact, according to his own book, He was a star athlete in high school, and in college played intramural sports, and was a lifeguard in the summer.
[02:57:26.641 --> 02:57:27.141]  Yep.
[02:57:27.141 --> 02:57:34.082]  A little Georgie Bush.
[02:57:34.265 --> 02:57:34.525]  Hey!
[02:57:35.025 --> 02:57:36.906]  Happy 9-11 Day!
[02:57:37.626 --> 02:57:38.426]  Here we are!
[02:57:39.247 --> 02:57:39.787]  Oh yeah!
[02:57:40.307 --> 02:57:43.328]  The war on terror that made life so lovely!
[02:57:44.248 --> 02:57:45.609]  That they spy on us!
[02:57:46.451 --> 02:57:47.872]  Homeland Security!
[02:57:48.713 --> 02:57:49.634]  NSA!
[02:57:50.735 --> 02:57:52.897]  Yeah, that little Georgie Bush?
[02:57:56.059 --> 02:57:56.680]  Same thing.
[02:57:57.941 --> 02:57:58.742]  Draft dodger.
[02:57:59.643 --> 02:58:11.353]  After graduating from Yale in 1968, President George Bush uses family connections to allow him to listen to the Texas Air National Guard for a six-year stint as a pilot.
[02:58:13.089 --> 02:58:18.633]  He did this because it became clear that President Johnson would not activate the guard to go to Vietnam.
[02:58:20.615 --> 02:58:26.580]  Therefore, it became almost impossible to get the guard, get into the guard in 1968.
[02:58:27.180 --> 02:58:31.523]  Nobody could get in, but Bush did, because, hey, look where the family comes from.
[02:58:32.264 --> 02:58:34.546]  As George Carlin says, one big club and you ain't in it.
[02:58:36.527 --> 02:58:44.427]   Especially to someone like Bush, who had low scores in the 25% Low scores!
[02:58:44.707 --> 02:58:46.268]  Listen to that jerk talk!
[02:58:47.169 --> 02:58:52.434]  Oh, and over 80% of the people believe the crap spewing is out of his mouth.
[02:58:52.814 --> 02:58:55.576]  We gotta get that guy Osama Bin Laden dead or alive.
[02:58:55.596 --> 02:58:59.039]  Oh, and by the way, what preceded the war on terror?
[02:58:59.500 --> 02:59:00.681]  Oh, the dot-com bust.
[02:59:01.141 --> 02:59:01.722]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:59:02.415 --> 02:59:08.119]  Right here in the Trends Journal, we had forecasted in 1999 that we'd crash by the second quarter of 2000.
[02:59:08.199 --> 02:59:10.300]  We were going to recession.
[02:59:10.400 --> 02:59:11.641]  Everybody hated Bush.
[02:59:12.181 --> 02:59:13.922]  But then, 9-11.
[02:59:15.563 --> 02:59:17.044]  Another little draft dodger.
[02:59:17.563 --> 02:59:18.063]  Yep.
[02:59:18.063 --> 02:59:27.482]  So here we are.
[02:59:27.482 --> 02:59:37.483]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:59:28.511 --> 02:59:30.152]  You better support InfoWars.
[02:59:31.192 --> 02:59:34.054]  Because if you don't, we're finished.
[02:59:35.054 --> 02:59:39.317]  They're gonna lock us up, shut us down, and maybe kill us.
[02:59:40.358 --> 02:59:41.899]  It's becoming the American way.
[02:59:43.159 --> 02:59:45.081]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:45.121 --> 02:59:47.862]  And as I said, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[02:59:48.483 --> 02:59:51.144]  Because InfoWars is doing everything they can to support you.
[02:59:52.145 --> 02:59:53.966]  And we are too, with the Trends Journal.
[02:59:54.006 --> 02:59:58.569]  You go to the special link that they have over there, and you get a discount.
[02:59:59.486 --> 03:00:01.127]  And we're giving you everything we can.
[03:00:01.827 --> 03:00:10.873]  I was mentioning about how Owen is being brought up on these charges while these presidents take us to war based on lies.
[03:00:11.433 --> 03:00:13.014]  This is from History Today.
[03:00:13.034 --> 03:00:17.456]  This day in history.
[03:00:19.798 --> 03:00:21.278]  1993, June 26th.
[03:00:21.458 --> 03:00:29.630]   In retaliation for an Iraqi plot to assassinate former President George H.W.
[03:00:29.690 --> 03:00:35.035]  Bush, during his April visit to Kuwait, President Bill Clinton orders U.S.
[03:00:35.175 --> 03:00:40.620]  warships to fire Tomahawk missiles at Iraqi intelligence headquarters.
[03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:42.722]  Isn't that nice?
[03:00:46.105 --> 03:00:47.506]  Which was a lot of baloney.
[03:00:47.987 --> 03:00:49.949]  And what are we doing all the- what's he doing?
[03:00:50.349 --> 03:00:53.672]  Why are we involved in- oh, that was the first George Bush-Iraq war.
[03:00:54.012 --> 03:00:54.453]  I forgot.
[03:00:55.350 --> 03:01:00.071]  And what did little George Bush say when he started the second Iraq war?
[03:01:01.492 --> 03:01:03.132]  They tried to kill my daddy.
[03:01:03.712 --> 03:01:04.793]  I'm not making that up.
[03:01:05.913 --> 03:01:08.714]  That's the imbeciles we got running our lives.
[03:01:10.214 --> 03:01:10.534]  Look at it.
[03:01:11.814 --> 03:01:16.774]  You got the Republican clown over there, McConnell.
[03:01:16.774 --> 03:01:25.094]  Biden, oh yeah, you saw what happened in Hanoi.
[03:01:25.405 --> 03:01:28.827]  Again, they had to take him off stage because he didn't know what he was talking about.
[03:01:29.788 --> 03:01:33.070]  Out of his mind, this is all we got.
[03:01:35.211 --> 03:01:43.536]  In April 13th, 1933, the day before George Bush was scheduled to Kuwait, to be honored for his victory in the Persian Gulf War.
[03:01:44.857 --> 03:01:45.057]  Yep.
[03:01:47.278 --> 03:01:47.959]  Total lie.
[03:01:49.039 --> 03:01:49.740]  Total lie.
[03:01:50.160 --> 03:01:51.381]  Kill anybody you want.
[03:01:52.321 --> 03:01:52.781]  There he is.
[03:01:53.001 --> 03:01:55.262]  These are the people running our lives.
[03:01:55.843 --> 03:01:56.983]  Don't forget to vote.
[03:01:57.763 --> 03:01:58.804]  Don't forget to vote.
[03:01:58.824 --> 03:02:03.486]  They're talking about Clinton.
[03:02:03.526 --> 03:02:06.907]  Bill Clinton received educational deferments in 1963 to 1968.
[03:02:08.427 --> 03:02:11.028]  Again, this is from Lawrence Corb.
[03:02:11.028 --> 03:02:18.027]  So he could attend Georgetown.
[03:02:18.678 --> 03:02:22.562]  And after graduating, accepted a Rhodes Scholarship to attend Oxford.
[03:02:23.803 --> 03:02:32.812]  However, in 1968, when the law that allowed men to receive deferments even for graduate law school changed, Clinton received his draft notice.
[03:02:33.293 --> 03:02:42.402]  But to avoid being drafted in 1968, Bill Clinton used his connections to get permission to join ROTC at the University of Arkansas Law School.
[03:02:43.146 --> 03:02:48.108]  This permitted him to avoid the draft and allowed him to return to Oxford to complete his master's.
[03:02:48.708 --> 03:02:55.551]  Moreover, in 1969, when he was returning from England, President Nixon instituted a draft lottery.
[03:02:56.051 --> 03:03:05.374]  When Clinton received a number that would have ensured that he would not be selected, he reneged on his commitment to join ROTC.
[03:03:05.854 --> 03:03:06.114]  All right?
[03:03:06.134 --> 03:03:07.655]  All right?
[03:03:09.750 --> 03:03:12.291]  A little warmongering freak!
[03:03:12.911 --> 03:03:16.313]  Like all these other warmongering freaks!
[03:03:16.993 --> 03:03:19.114]  Like little Lindsey Graham!
[03:03:19.474 --> 03:03:21.355]  A warmongering freak!
[03:03:21.675 --> 03:03:22.596]  Hey, did you go fight?
[03:03:23.656 --> 03:03:23.937]  No?
[03:03:25.177 --> 03:03:27.178]  Well, we'll send others to go die!
[03:03:27.198 --> 03:03:31.580]  Hey, how about that Blumenthal up in Connecticut?
[03:03:32.721 --> 03:03:34.701]  Oh yeah, he got a load of deferments!
[03:03:35.802 --> 03:03:38.003]  Oh yeah, but he was another guy connected!
[03:03:39.002 --> 03:03:43.485]  So, he went into the Marines, but he served in D.C.
[03:03:43.625 --> 03:03:44.526]  and Connecticut.
[03:03:45.287 --> 03:03:47.808]  And what did he just got back from Ukraine?
[03:03:48.469 --> 03:03:49.810]  Say to keep the war going?
[03:03:51.751 --> 03:03:51.951]  Yep.
[03:03:52.712 --> 03:03:54.193]  One after another.
[03:03:54.773 --> 03:03:55.494]  Look at this guy.
[03:03:55.974 --> 03:03:57.295]  Hey, would you bleach your hair?
[03:03:57.856 --> 03:03:58.816]  We're the same age.
[03:03:58.876 --> 03:04:00.017]  Mine turned grey.
[03:04:00.557 --> 03:04:01.458]  Look at this guy!
[03:04:02.199 --> 03:04:02.599]  Look at him!
[03:04:03.430 --> 03:04:05.351]  An arrogant, evil man!
[03:04:05.911 --> 03:04:07.512]  You want to support Ukraine?
[03:04:07.912 --> 03:04:09.113]  Stay over there and fight!
[03:04:09.653 --> 03:04:20.738]  Anybody who wants to support Ukraine, send your money, send your wife, send your kids, send your transgenders, send your money, put on your costume, and go fight, or shut your mouth!
[03:04:23.839 --> 03:04:24.059]  Yep.
[03:04:26.780 --> 03:04:27.601]  You ready for this one?
[03:04:28.661 --> 03:04:29.942]  Little Mittens Romney.
[03:04:31.152 --> 03:04:33.753]  Another little arrogant clown boy.
[03:04:33.773 --> 03:04:37.413]  Oh, he was the governor of Massachusetts.
[03:04:37.493 --> 03:04:39.174]  Oh, now I'm over there in Utah.
[03:04:39.194 --> 03:04:41.394]  A lot of Mormons over there and I'm a Mormon.
[03:04:44.355 --> 03:04:46.895]  August 27th.
[03:04:47.875 --> 03:04:58.337]  Not long ago, ex-presidential candidate Mitt Romney's claim that sending weapons to Keeve is Washington's best defense investment, you ready?
[03:04:58.698 --> 03:04:59.238]  In history.
[03:04:59.778 --> 03:05:00.878]  Who is this guy talking to?
[03:05:02.512 --> 03:05:03.473]  Who's he talking to?
[03:05:03.933 --> 03:05:06.656]  He's talking to the general public, Salenti!
[03:05:06.936 --> 03:05:08.177]  So shut your mouth!
[03:05:11.981 --> 03:05:12.181]  Yep.
[03:05:15.944 --> 03:05:22.130]  He made his comments during a visit on Tuesday to Utah-based defense contractor Strider Technologies.
[03:05:22.230 --> 03:05:22.570]  Great.
[03:05:23.271 --> 03:05:25.353]  He argued that the best way for the U.S.
[03:05:25.373 --> 03:05:32.911]   to mitigate the security threat posed by China Is to ensure that Russia is defeated in Ukraine.
[03:05:33.272 --> 03:05:35.193]  These are the imbeciles running the show.
[03:05:36.534 --> 03:05:40.998]  Russia being weakened weakens their ally China, Romney said.
[03:05:41.318 --> 03:05:53.948]  And by the way, being able to take an amount that equals about 5% of our military budget to help the Ukrainians is the best national defense spending I think we've ever done.
[03:05:53.968 --> 03:05:58.011]  I think you're a real moron!
[03:05:58.775 --> 03:06:00.856]  I think you're an arrogant jerk!
[03:06:01.536 --> 03:06:04.357]  I think you're a cowardly draft dodger!
[03:06:04.737 --> 03:06:06.618]  You didn't go- we're the same age!
[03:06:07.759 --> 03:06:08.939]  You didn't go to Vietnam!
[03:06:09.359 --> 03:06:10.540]  No, no, no!
[03:06:14.021 --> 03:06:14.221]  Yep.
[03:06:17.582 --> 03:06:27.086]  Raised in Blue Hills, Michigan by George and Lenore Romney, he spent over two years in France as a Mormon missionary during the Vietnam War.
[03:06:28.385 --> 03:06:30.186]  He married Ann Davis, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:06:30.886 --> 03:06:34.067]  Active in the Church of the Later Day Saints.
[03:06:36.468 --> 03:06:36.668]  Yep.
[03:06:37.907 --> 03:06:42.626]   As church of the later day saints renounced war and violence as a means to settle disputes.
[03:06:42.626 --> 03:06:57.275]   Where where where where As a church, Later Day Saints renounced war and violence as a means of settling dispute.
[03:06:58.021 --> 03:07:04.904]  To those who would violate their peace and freedom, Latter-day Saints first lift the standard of peace.
[03:07:05.684 --> 03:07:12.226]  They bear repeated offensive with patience while exploring peaceful alternatives to war.
[03:07:12.306 --> 03:07:12.526]  Huh.
[03:07:14.187 --> 03:07:18.989]  I guess these Latter-day Saints are really late on the Ukraine war.
[03:07:23.549 --> 03:07:27.949]  What a bunch of clowns running and ruining our lives.
[03:07:27.949 --> 03:07:39.148]   It is very much in America's national interest, in our national interest to help Ukraine.
[03:07:39.516 --> 03:07:47.340]  And the best thing we can do for America is to see people who have nuclear weapons aimed at us getting weaker.
[03:07:50.962 --> 03:07:56.545]  Romney claims the US is devastating the Russian military by arming Ukraine.
[03:07:56.565 --> 03:07:58.446]  Oh yeah?
[03:07:59.567 --> 03:08:00.968]  Ukraine's losing this war.
[03:08:02.563 --> 03:08:04.344]  We're getting one-side reports.
[03:08:05.764 --> 03:08:08.625]  You listen to Colonel McGregor, Douglas McGregor.
[03:08:09.626 --> 03:08:11.086]  You listen to Scott Ritter.
[03:08:12.347 --> 03:08:15.348]  You listen to the other people that are bringing in other information.
[03:08:16.288 --> 03:08:26.032]  The counter-offensive, the spring counter-offensive, that now they're talking about a fall, an autumn counter-offensive?
[03:08:26.833 --> 03:08:29.894]  And the spring counter-offensive didn't start until almost the summer?
[03:08:30.811 --> 03:08:33.632]  And Russia still controls almost 20% of the country?
[03:08:35.592 --> 03:08:38.093]  Only about 6 million Ukrainians left the country.
[03:08:38.613 --> 03:08:42.054]  Only 17 million are in need of financial aid.
[03:08:42.074 --> 03:08:46.655]  Their infrastructure is being destroyed.
[03:08:47.516 --> 03:08:49.636]  And you got a clown boy saying that we're winning.
[03:08:50.296 --> 03:08:50.796]  They're winning.
[03:08:53.957 --> 03:08:56.478]  I guess they're gonna kill me for saying that.
[03:08:57.751 --> 03:09:02.113]  Listen, when we come back, I'm going to talk about the economy, because we're going to go into rough, rough territory.
[03:09:02.453 --> 03:09:03.233]  We'll be right back.
[03:09:03.513 --> 03:09:04.374]  Support InfoWars.
[03:09:05.114 --> 03:09:06.975]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:07.975 --> 03:09:12.017]  Again, if you subscribe to the Trends Journal, you get a big break on it.

[03:09:28.451 --> 03:09:32.514]  It's like about $2 a week when you subscribe, nothing.

[03:09:40.820 --> 03:09:41.020]  Yeah.
[03:09:41.440 --> 03:09:43.942]  So anyway, and also support InfoWars.
[03:09:43.962 --> 03:09:46.944]  They got great products out there and they're not going to last.

[03:10:02.259 --> 03:10:05.040]  And they got a load of other ones.
[03:10:05.080 --> 03:10:08.661]  They got the DNA Force Plus, and that's back.
[03:10:09.761 --> 03:10:13.522]  And got one great product after another.
[03:10:14.462 --> 03:10:17.683]  So get what you can because they're giving you everything that they can.
[03:10:18.123 --> 03:10:19.083]  It's back in stock.
[03:10:19.943 --> 03:10:23.644]  And you want to get that DNA going up because everything else is going down.
[03:10:24.564 --> 03:10:26.845]  So moving on to the economy.
[03:10:27.950 --> 03:10:28.671]  Yep, there you go.
[03:10:28.691 --> 03:10:31.774]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:10:32.514 --> 03:10:35.257]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:10:36.598 --> 03:10:38.800]  DNA Force Plus.
[03:10:42.003 --> 03:10:45.727]  So, going back, I just want to finish this up before I go on to the economy.
[03:10:47.488 --> 03:10:53.634]  GOP hopeful Mitt Romney was the first candidate to react to former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi's death.
[03:10:54.232 --> 03:10:57.893]  Quote, I think it's about time, Romney said in a town hall in Iowa.
[03:10:57.933 --> 03:10:59.594]  Isn't that great?
[03:11:00.874 --> 03:11:04.676]  A terrible tyrant that killed his own people, and murdered Americans and others.
[03:11:05.496 --> 03:11:05.816]  Oh yeah?
[03:11:08.977 --> 03:11:10.518]  Killed more people than America did?
[03:11:11.938 --> 03:11:12.518]  Vietnam?
[03:11:13.039 --> 03:11:14.539]  That you draft-dodged and you didn't go to?
[03:11:14.559 --> 03:11:18.821]  Only about over 3 million poisoned the place with Agent Orange, as well as our soldiers?
[03:11:19.801 --> 03:11:20.641]  Killed some 60,000 US guys?
[03:11:23.623 --> 03:11:25.623]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[03:11:25.623 --> 03:11:40.623]  [Music]
[03:11:40.623 --> 03:11:49.023]   It would take hours to go over all the evidence which proves that the attack on September 11, 2001 was an inside
[03:11:49.023 --> 03:11:49.623]  job.
[03:11:50.025 --> 03:11:52.627]  And I suggest you look into it if you haven't already.
[03:11:53.167 --> 03:11:56.950]  But to simplify the situation, all you need to do is look at Building 7.
[03:11:57.851 --> 03:12:03.897]  What some people still don't realize is that there were three buildings that fell into their own footprint that day.
[03:12:04.297 --> 03:12:12.125]  Three buildings that fell at free fall speed, indistinguishable from controlled demolitions, because that's exactly what they were.
[03:12:12.726 --> 03:12:17.410]  As the towers came crashing down, we can see the signatures of a controlled demolition.
[03:12:18.451 --> 03:12:33.499]  The official story is that Building 7, known as 7 World Trade Center, caught fire as a result of debris from the Twin Towers, which somehow caused a critical internal column to break, causing a cascading failure and collapse.
[03:12:34.019 --> 03:12:41.943]  And if this nonsensical official narrative were true, it would make it the first and only steel skyscraper in the world to collapse from fires.
[03:12:42.643 --> 03:12:51.670]  The building's owner, Larry Silverstein, took control of the Twin Towers just weeks before 9-11, and had them insured to cover terrorist attacks.
[03:12:52.270 --> 03:13:00.736]  After Building 7 collapsed, Silverstein told the media that the decision was made to pull it, suggesting that the building was collapsed on purpose.
[03:13:00.856 --> 03:13:07.221]  I remember getting a call from the fight-upon-commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[03:13:07.241 --> 03:13:10.784]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[03:13:13.275 --> 03:13:15.616]  Hey, great being back here.
[03:13:15.656 --> 03:13:17.497]  We had a little, uh, technical difficulty.
[03:13:18.137 --> 03:13:23.498]  So you get the rest of that on band dot, you know, the video there, the, what I was talking about Mitt Romney.
[03:13:24.338 --> 03:13:29.340]  And he goes, we went, then he goes, he loved that Romney, that Gaddafi got killed.
[03:13:29.720 --> 03:13:31.900]  I think it's about time he said, after he found out.
[03:13:32.560 --> 03:13:40.076]   And then on April 26th, 2021, He said, we went there to eliminate the threat to Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and knock down the Taliban.
[03:13:40.456 --> 03:13:46.600]  We stayed there for 20 years because we knew if we left, Al-Qaeda would reconstitute the attack on us again.
[03:13:47.180 --> 03:13:48.782]  Yeah, here we are, 9-11.
[03:13:49.142 --> 03:13:50.443]  Nobody attacked us since.
[03:13:50.883 --> 03:13:54.965]  I guess that's because we get felt up at the airport and it works so great, you know?
[03:13:55.466 --> 03:13:55.726]  Yeah.
[03:13:57.387 --> 03:14:00.529]  And again, you want the Trends Journal, you go to jonestrends.com.
[03:14:00.969 --> 03:14:02.050]  I want to get into the economy.
[03:14:04.008 --> 03:14:15.198]  American consumers are worried about access to credit amid persistently high interest rates and tighter standards at banks according to the Federal Reserve survey released today.
[03:14:16.618 --> 03:14:17.618]  All right.
[03:14:17.618 --> 03:14:23.618]  It's one after another.
[03:14:23.825 --> 03:14:40.294]   And by the way, these guys, you know, that are going in there, and young kids too, this smash and grab stuff, That they're doing, you know, they're going into stores, these flash grabs, they call them, whatever they call them.
[03:14:40.334 --> 03:14:42.934]  This didn't happen before the COVID lockdowns.
[03:14:43.834 --> 03:14:44.594]  This didn't happen.
[03:14:46.475 --> 03:14:49.215]  And San Francisco is like, you know, it's Helltown now.
[03:14:49.935 --> 03:14:51.516]  Yeah, I left my heart in San Francisco.
[03:14:52.816 --> 03:14:55.496]  Yeah, you left more than your heart in San Francisco.
[03:14:56.376 --> 03:14:59.857]  You left the future of America in San Francisco when these clowns locked everything down.
[03:15:00.996 --> 03:15:04.557]  So one store after another is closing down and changing.
[03:15:04.597 --> 03:15:06.897]  This was not happening before the COVID war.
[03:15:07.617 --> 03:15:13.199]  Guys are not beating up 60, 70 year old people with bats and sticks before the COVID war.
[03:15:15.819 --> 03:15:18.680]  Suicide rates are not skyrocketing before the COVID war.
[03:15:19.420 --> 03:15:20.120]  On and on and on.
[03:15:20.200 --> 03:15:21.680]  But anyway, I want to go back to the economy.
[03:15:22.581 --> 03:15:24.101]  I'm just going to read you some quick headlines.
[03:15:25.301 --> 03:15:27.021]  Startup funding shrinks in Europe.
[03:15:27.802 --> 03:15:29.382]  Eurozone recession likely.
[03:15:30.396 --> 03:15:31.976]  As business activity slows.
[03:15:33.457 --> 03:15:36.598]  Eurozone business downturn increases uncertainty on rates.
[03:15:37.578 --> 03:15:41.659]  Eurozone house building falls at its fastest pace since 2020.
[03:15:41.979 --> 03:15:45.620]  Yeah, that was when the COVID war began and everything was locked down.
[03:15:45.640 --> 03:15:48.541]  Eurozone business activity slumps.
[03:15:49.821 --> 03:15:57.043]  Business activity in 19 European countries that use the euro has been contracting faster than anticipated.
[03:15:57.323 --> 03:16:03.387]   Now, not faster than anticipated, Faster than what you were saying, but we didn't anticipate it.
[03:16:03.427 --> 03:16:06.207]  We said it was going to crash and it's going to get worse.
[03:16:06.467 --> 03:16:07.407]  It's in your magazine.
[03:16:07.447 --> 03:16:08.608]  We've been saying it for months.
[03:16:10.028 --> 03:16:17.969]  Their Purchasing Managers Index, the PMI, it's at 46.7.
[03:16:19.449 --> 03:16:23.950]  Manufacturing is important, not consumer spending.
[03:16:25.250 --> 03:16:28.071]  Any number under 50 is contraction.
[03:16:31.050 --> 03:16:32.191]  46.7 is contraction.
[03:16:34.292 --> 03:16:35.133]  And it goes on.
[03:16:35.213 --> 03:16:36.533]  It's one after another down.
[03:16:36.914 --> 03:16:40.776]  German industrial gloom deepens as production falls.
[03:16:42.617 --> 03:16:42.857]  Yep.
[03:16:43.698 --> 03:16:45.979]  Fell 0.8% month-on-month.
[03:16:47.400 --> 03:16:49.721]  They anticipated it would only go down 0.5.
[03:16:50.642 --> 03:16:52.943]  Germany's economic rut gets deeper.
[03:16:54.824 --> 03:16:57.066]  German business confidence slides.
[03:16:59.324 --> 03:17:03.907]  Germany's shrinking economy sparks a struggle for solutions.
[03:17:05.548 --> 03:17:08.049]  Germany facing zero growth.
[03:17:08.170 --> 03:17:09.831]  Oh, that's according to the Bundesbank.
[03:17:10.851 --> 03:17:16.255]  So no, it's not a misinformation.
[03:17:20.938 --> 03:17:25.200]  Germany is the world's fourth largest economy.
[03:17:26.001 --> 03:17:26.441]  Got it?
[03:17:30.148 --> 03:17:30.768]  Bloomberg.
[03:17:32.249 --> 03:17:36.249]  China's worsening economic slowdown is rippling across the globe.
[03:17:36.810 --> 03:17:38.990]  Blow me away, I would have never guessed it.
[03:17:43.831 --> 03:17:49.313]  Post-pandemic world facing gloomy stew of debt, trade wars, and poor productivity.
[03:17:49.393 --> 03:17:49.873]  Reuters.
[03:17:52.133 --> 03:17:56.674]  Chinese exports fall for the fourth straight month.
[03:17:58.715 --> 03:17:58.955]  Ready?
[03:18:00.165 --> 03:18:04.907]  Wall Street Journal just came out late last week.
[03:18:05.467 --> 03:18:09.809]  Real estate doom loop threatens America's banks.
[03:18:11.230 --> 03:18:12.350]  No kidding.
[03:18:13.411 --> 03:18:16.532]  We've been warning about this since the lockdowns.
[03:18:16.572 --> 03:18:24.736]  Your office vacancy rate, excuse me, occupancy rate, according to Castle, of the 10 largest cities is around 47%.
[03:18:24.575 --> 03:18:43.774]   47 percent. All the businesses that depended on [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:18:35.733 --> 03:18:36.333]  Commuters.
[03:18:38.234 --> 03:18:38.574]  Gone.
[03:18:39.475 --> 03:18:39.955]  Going out.
[03:18:42.637 --> 03:18:47.160]  People are going to work Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, no more happy hours on Friday.
[03:18:48.361 --> 03:18:50.942]  This banking bust is real.
[03:18:51.863 --> 03:18:54.044]  It's only going to get worse.
[03:18:56.206 --> 03:18:57.767]  The worst is yet to come.
[03:18:58.777 --> 03:19:02.181]  You better do everything you can to prepare, prevail, and prosper.
[03:19:03.642 --> 03:19:09.548]  And again, we're doing everything we can, and you do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[03:19:10.429 --> 03:19:12.271]  Because they're gonna take us off the air.
[03:19:12.932 --> 03:19:18.578]  People hate me because I'm on InfoWars, but I love InfoWars because who they are and what they do.
[03:19:19.478 --> 03:19:21.478]  So I support them.
[03:19:21.478 --> 03:19:26.478]  [Music]
[03:19:27.478 --> 03:19:29.478]  I've not been this excited ever!
[03:19:29.478 --> 03:19:30.478]  [Cheering]
[03:19:30.478 --> 03:19:32.478]  Yeah, Mud Club, baby! Wow!
[03:19:32.896 --> 03:19:35.479]  The replatforming begins now.
[03:19:35.439 --> 03:19:39.439]  Join Mug Club and get one month free with promo code "Alex"
[03:19:39.439 --> 03:19:52.278]   at JonesCrowder.com I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:19:52.443 --> 03:19:54.628]  I personally have to pay my legal bills.
[03:19:54.769 --> 03:19:56.313]  The court has ruled I have to pay for half the bills.
[03:19:56.333 --> 03:19:57.716]  Keep free speech on air.
[03:19:58.037 --> 03:19:58.819]  I don't have any money.
[03:19:59.932 --> 03:20:03.614]  And my back bills of the year are a little over a million dollars.
[03:20:03.674 --> 03:20:04.335]  Sounds like a lot.
[03:20:04.655 --> 03:20:06.536]  Trump's already spent almost 70 million this year alone.
[03:20:06.876 --> 03:20:08.057]  You want us to fight the globalists?
[03:20:08.497 --> 03:20:09.298]  Sounds like big numbers.
[03:20:09.358 --> 03:20:10.018]  It's not, folks.
[03:20:10.538 --> 03:20:11.359]  We need your support.
[03:20:11.779 --> 03:20:12.920]  It's a decision you've got to make.
[03:20:13.620 --> 03:20:15.481]  Buy products at InfoWarsaw.com that enrich your life.
[03:20:15.501 --> 03:20:15.901]  They're great.
[03:20:16.182 --> 03:20:16.902]  That funds free speech.
[03:20:17.342 --> 03:20:19.704]  The judge has said I've got to pay half the legal bills and everything else.
[03:20:19.964 --> 03:20:20.484]  I can't do it.
[03:20:20.944 --> 03:20:27.702]   So this is our chain in the armor and we'll have to shut down Pretty soon.
[03:20:28.302 --> 03:20:30.163]  And then as soon as they're shut down, we'll get all the money.
[03:20:31.103 --> 03:20:32.624]  Once you start this, you can't stop this.
[03:20:34.084 --> 03:20:35.645]  So, I'm firing the bat signal.
[03:20:35.685 --> 03:20:36.765]  I appreciate all your ongoing support.
[03:20:37.005 --> 03:20:38.265]  We're in a major toe-to-toe battle.
[03:20:38.305 --> 03:20:39.006]  Long-term war.
[03:20:39.366 --> 03:20:40.786]  I'm sorry I gotta keep asking for support.
[03:20:41.406 --> 03:20:43.287]  But I'm asking you humbly to keep us on air.
[03:20:44.087 --> 03:20:45.588]  To go to DefendJones.com.
[03:20:46.188 --> 03:20:47.088]  A give, send, go account.
[03:20:47.168 --> 03:20:48.129]  DefendJones.com.
[03:20:48.569 --> 03:20:49.969]  I appreciate those that donated in the past.
[03:20:50.369 --> 03:20:51.670]  I appreciate everybody that supported the show.
[03:20:51.710 --> 03:20:52.310]  You know who you are.
[03:20:53.459 --> 03:20:55.820]  We've raised like $25,000 in the last couple hours.
[03:20:55.860 --> 03:20:56.641]  That sounds great.
[03:20:56.961 --> 03:20:58.922]  I've got a million dollar problem.
[03:20:59.462 --> 03:21:00.943]  I think in the next month, you're going to come through.
[03:21:00.963 --> 03:21:02.304]  I think we'll raise it.
[03:21:02.424 --> 03:21:10.669]  Unlike selling a million dollars of supplements, and we make $300,000 or $400,000, or we sell water filters, a million dollars of water filters, and we make $200,000.
[03:21:12.050 --> 03:21:13.451]  I'm not complaining.
[03:21:13.471 --> 03:21:15.272]  It's just we don't put a lot of markup in there, and they're high quality.
[03:21:15.932 --> 03:21:16.933]  And they give me the best deals.
[03:21:17.473 --> 03:21:18.454]  This is how my brain works.
[03:21:18.474 --> 03:21:20.835]  People say, oh, just have bigger markup.
[03:21:20.855 --> 03:21:21.495]  You won't have any problems.
[03:21:21.555 --> 03:21:22.436]  I just, I can't do it.
[03:21:23.925 --> 03:21:27.447]  But I'm separate from the free speech bankruptcy, and I'm out of money.
[03:21:28.227 --> 03:21:29.908]  And we're actually winning these cases, as you see.
[03:21:29.948 --> 03:21:30.788]  They're really freaked out.
[03:21:31.549 --> 03:21:33.350]  So, I need your support.
[03:21:33.610 --> 03:21:34.530]  It's a long-term fight.
[03:21:34.570 --> 03:21:35.311]  We've fought so long.
[03:21:35.331 --> 03:21:36.891]  You can decide whether you want to give up or not.
[03:21:37.272 --> 03:21:38.632]  I know you don't want to, most of you.
[03:21:39.993 --> 03:21:41.454]  But I wanted to read some of the great comments.
[03:21:41.494 --> 03:21:43.174]  We've had some big donations, small donations.
[03:21:43.194 --> 03:21:46.556]  They're all wonderful, and we appreciate you at DefendJones.com.
[03:21:47.657 --> 03:21:49.938]  Anonymously, privately, give, or you can comment if you want.
[03:21:51.019 --> 03:21:51.980]  This is an anonymous donor.
[03:21:52.361 --> 03:21:53.862]  One minute to go.
[03:21:53.882 --> 03:21:53.862]  $50.
[03:21:53.962 --> 03:21:55.364]  Bless you, Alex M. Forrest.
[03:21:55.404 --> 03:21:55.964]  Bless you, too.
[03:21:56.725 --> 03:21:58.607]  Taylor gave $30.
[03:21:59.208 --> 03:22:03.312]  I am going broke, but the dollar won't be around much longer anyways.
[03:22:03.352 --> 03:22:04.012]  Exactly, folks.
[03:22:04.032 --> 03:22:05.334]  You've got to put money in to win.
[03:22:05.854 --> 03:22:08.677]  Hope to see lots of engagement with this fund.
[03:22:08.937 --> 03:22:09.698]  It will stay on air.
[03:22:09.718 --> 03:22:10.359]  That's what will happen.
[03:22:11.380 --> 03:22:12.081]  Anonymous donor.
[03:22:13.691 --> 03:22:14.992]  $50.
[03:22:13.751 --> 03:22:14.992]  Thank you for your work.
[03:22:15.052 --> 03:22:15.472]  Thank you.

[03:22:19.194 --> 03:22:22.416]  95% correct accuracy rate of geopolitical diagnosis and cure rate.
[03:22:24.057 --> 03:22:25.898]  Vincent.
[03:22:26.238 --> 03:22:25.898]  $250.
[03:22:26.798 --> 03:22:27.118]  Thank you.
[03:22:27.598 --> 03:22:33.461]  Alex, you woke me up in the early 2000s with 9-11 road to tyranny, and I've been a regular listener and contributor since 2007.
[03:22:33.501 --> 03:22:33.842]  Thank you.
[03:22:33.862 --> 03:22:34.482]  You are the Infowar.
[03:22:34.922 --> 03:22:36.983]  I'm praying for you and President Trump on a regular basis.
[03:22:37.403 --> 03:22:40.705]  Stay strong, and thank you for doing what you're doing, brother.
[03:22:40.725 --> 03:22:41.125]  Vincent.
[03:22:41.165 --> 03:22:41.806]  Thank you, Vincent.

[03:22:44.192 --> 03:22:45.313]  Woo!

[03:22:55.342 --> 03:22:55.762]  Jesus.

[03:23:07.888 --> 03:23:11.329]  The Bible says, if God is for me, who can be against me in the fight?
[03:23:12.089 --> 03:23:16.631]  And with Jesus by your side, darkness, fighting darkness, you'll prevail.
[03:23:17.192 --> 03:23:21.313]  The kingdom of darkness doesn't stand a chance because we already have the victory.
[03:23:21.574 --> 03:23:25.015]  My prayers go with you, Alex, and may the Holy Spirit give you peace.
[03:23:25.055 --> 03:23:25.415]  Thank you.
[03:23:25.475 --> 03:23:25.795]  Amen.
[03:23:26.256 --> 03:23:27.236]  That's just some of the comments.
[03:23:27.256 --> 03:23:27.896]  Thank you so much.
[03:23:27.936 --> 03:23:28.597]  That means so much.
[03:23:29.568 --> 03:23:33.010]  Please go to DefendJones.com and if you want to keep me in the fight, it's your decision.
[03:23:33.030 --> 03:23:33.790]  I'm not saying you should.
[03:23:33.810 --> 03:23:34.651]  I'm not trying to make you do it.
[03:23:34.891 --> 03:23:36.752]  Beat this dog in the fight and donate now.
[03:23:36.992 --> 03:23:37.953]  Action is victory.
[03:23:38.073 --> 03:23:39.093]  Resistance is victory.
[03:23:39.294 --> 03:23:40.254]  It is in your court.
[03:23:40.374 --> 03:23:43.216]  It is your decision whether to pull the plug on this operation or not.
