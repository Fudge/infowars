[00:00:00.745 --> 00:00:04.828]  Good evening, my friends, and welcome to an Alex Jones Emergency News Alert.
[00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:07.229]  And good evening, welcome to Tucker Carlson.
[00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.592]  There isn't just evil in the world, there's also good.
[00:00:12.092 --> 00:00:17.595]  And a few weeks ago, Tucker Carlson, with the top news show in the world, got fired from Fox News for telling the truth.
[00:00:17.615 --> 00:00:21.398]  And I told you back then I won't bore you with all the videos, regular listeners saw it.
[00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:27.076]  I told you that he would not go with Newsmax, he would not go with the other shows that are offering money.
[00:00:27.376 --> 00:00:30.738]  He wants to be totally independent and control his new show.
[00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:33.099]  Because somebody very close to Tucker Carlson told me that.
[00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:36.341]  And also said look for him to do a deal with Elon Musk.
[00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:39.883]  I'm on record, viral news stories all over the news be saying it.
[00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:41.684]  It's there, it's on record.
[00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:45.786]  So yet again, InfoWars.com, Alex Jones, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:55.394]  It is so exciting that in Maine and in Florida, he'll be hosting a show 12 months out of the year, weeknights, with Tucker Carlson tonight.
[00:00:55.794 --> 00:00:56.895]  This is so exciting.
[00:00:56.975 --> 00:01:07.217]  And look, you can say what you want about Elon Musk, but putting Tucker Carlson on the air, who is not going to be censored or controlled, is another major feather in Elon Musk's hat.
[00:01:07.957 --> 00:01:15.386]   So we salute Tucker Carlson, we salute all of you, and I want to remind you His first video he put out a few weeks ago has 25 million views.
[00:01:16.107 --> 00:01:21.089]  That's four, five, six times all the viewers that Fox News has every day.
[00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:23.209]  His latest video just launched a few hours ago.
[00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:24.330]  Millions and millions of views.
[00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.210]  It'll have 50 million views.
[00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.691]  This is so exciting.
[00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:28.371]  People don't want networks.
[00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:32.293]  They don't want corporate establishment, Disney or Hollywood or any of that.
[00:01:32.553 --> 00:01:33.973]  They want authenticity.
[00:01:34.034 --> 00:01:34.974]  They want reality.
[00:01:35.034 --> 00:01:37.495]  They want pro-human information.
[00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:42.018]  And Tucker Carlson is the essential example of that, and so is InfoWars.
[00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:50.726]  So we're battle-hardened, we're under attack, but you recognize the fact that we're under attack by these evil forces shows how bona fide and authentic we are.
[00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:54.989]  I'm not financed by George Soros, Democratic Party, Republican Party, any of that.
[00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:59.333]  I'm financed by you, your word of mouth, your prayer, and supporting us at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:59.773 --> 00:02:05.598]  So here is Tucker from his great compound in Maine, reporting to the world.
[00:02:06.516 --> 00:02:07.836]  About what he's planning to do.
[00:02:07.896 --> 00:02:09.057]  This is so beautiful.
[00:02:09.557 --> 00:02:11.018]  It obsesses the system so much.
[00:02:12.018 --> 00:02:13.939]  Fox has leaked all this garbage against Tucker.
[00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:19.140]  They're trying to put handcuffs on him so he, quote, can't be on cable until January 2025.
[00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:27.103]  But in his contract, he can be online because the big cable giants aren't worried about the internet.
[00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:32.705]  It'll be even bigger on the internet, just like Joe Rogan, and we'll then end up on every channel.
[00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:36.969]  So, Joe Rogan is huge, he's the king of the hill right now, and I love Joe.
[00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.390]  He's a good friend of mine, lives right here in Austin.
[00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.691]  Hell Studios is a mile away.
[00:02:40.512 --> 00:02:47.097]  But, look out, Tucker Carlson's about to go from iconic to game-changing historic.
[00:02:47.617 --> 00:02:49.939]  And I'm just blessed and honored to be here.
[00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.541]  So, we're still at InfoWars.com and BandOffVideo.
[00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:54.483]  We're still on the air every day, seven days a week.
[00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.710]  11 a.m.
[00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.411]  Central Weekdays, InfoWars.com.
[00:02:57.891 --> 00:03:00.272]  Here is Tucker Carlson talking about the reality of what's happening.
[00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:02.213]  And remember, I told you all this.
[00:03:02.273 --> 00:03:04.034]  I said, don't hold your breath, Newsmax.
[00:03:05.074 --> 00:03:05.874]  Don't hold your breath.
[00:03:05.974 --> 00:03:10.556]  Patrick McDavid, who's a great guy, he's not gonna go with somebody else controlling him.
[00:03:10.936 --> 00:03:13.837]  He's gonna go with an independent platform where he has full control.
[00:03:14.218 --> 00:03:18.539]  So if you thought Tucker Carlson was hardcore before, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:22.481]  And this is another archetypal Carl Jung story.
[00:03:23.725 --> 00:03:26.064]  of the hero of a thousand faces.
[00:03:26.064 --> 00:03:27.625]  This is happening now.
[00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:29.825]  Evil is not the only power in the universe.
[00:03:29.825 --> 00:03:31.346]  There's also humanity as well.
[00:03:31.346 --> 00:03:36.186]   So here's Tucker Carlson with his big announcement that just came out about an hour ago, going viral now.
[00:03:36.186 --> 00:03:40.506]   But regardless, we'll see you weekdays, 11 a.m. Central, infowares.com.
[00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:41.346]  God bless.
[00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:43.705]  Hey, it's Tucker Carlson.
[00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:46.757]  You often hear people say the news is full of lies.
[00:03:47.357 --> 00:03:49.358]  But most of the time, that's not exactly right.
[00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.841]  Much of what you see on television or read in the New York Times is in fact true in the literal sense.
[00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.222]  You could pass one of the media's own fact checks.
[00:03:57.802 --> 00:03:59.403]  Lawyers would be willing to sign off on it.
[00:03:59.523 --> 00:04:00.344]  In fact, they may have.
[00:04:01.044 --> 00:04:02.345]  But that doesn't make it true.
[00:04:02.705 --> 00:04:03.366]  It's not true.
[00:04:04.026 --> 00:04:06.968]  At the most basic level, the news you consume is a lie.
[00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.070]  A lie of the stealthiest and most insidious kind.
[00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:14.974]  Facts have been withheld on purpose, along with proportion and perspective.
[00:04:15.614 --> 00:04:16.655]  You are being manipulated.
[00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:17.856]  How does that work?
[00:04:18.236 --> 00:04:18.677]  Let's see.
[00:04:19.197 --> 00:04:24.761]  If I tell you that a man has been unjustly arrested for armed robbery, that is not, strictly speaking, a lie.
[00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:26.262]  He may have been framed.
[00:04:26.302 --> 00:04:28.584]  At this point, there's been no trial, so no one can really say.
[00:04:29.568 --> 00:04:37.171]  But if I don't mention the fact that the same man has been arrested for the same crime six times before, am I really informing you?
[00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:38.291]  No, I'm not.
[00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:39.631]  I'm misleading you.
[00:04:40.332 --> 00:04:46.314]  And that's what the news media are doing in every story that matters, every day of the week, every week of the year.
[00:04:47.154 --> 00:04:49.135]  What's it like to work in a system like that?
[00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:52.958]  After more than 30 years in the middle of it, we could tell you stories.
[00:04:53.598 --> 00:04:58.763]  The best you can hope for in the news business at this point is the freedom to tell the fullest truth that you can.
[00:04:59.363 --> 00:05:00.685]  But there are always limits.
[00:05:01.185 --> 00:05:06.069]  And you know that if you bump up against those limits often enough, you will be fired for it.
[00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.270]  That's not a guess.
[00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:08.591]  It's guaranteed.
[00:05:09.372 --> 00:05:13.093]  Every person who works in English-language media understands that.
[00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:17.055]  The rule of what you can't say defines everything.
[00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:20.456]  It's filthy, really, and it's utterly corrupting.
[00:05:21.157 --> 00:05:25.018]  You can't have a free society if people aren't allowed to say what they think is true.
[00:05:25.818 --> 00:05:28.859]  Speech is the fundamental prerequisite for democracy.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.361]  That's why it's enshrined in the first of our constitutional amendments.
[00:05:33.214 --> 00:05:38.036]  Amazingly, as of tonight, there aren't many platforms left that allow free speech.
[00:05:38.616 --> 00:05:44.178]  The last big one remaining in the world, the only one, is Twitter, where we are now.
[00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:49.821]  Twitter has long served as the place where our national conversation incubates and develops.
[00:05:50.481 --> 00:05:51.942]  Twitter is not a partisan site.
[00:05:52.122 --> 00:05:54.883]  Everybody's allowed here, and we think that's a good thing.
[00:05:55.799 --> 00:06:04.086]  And yet for the most part, the news that you see analyzed on Twitter comes from media organizations that are themselves thinly disguised propaganda outlets.
[00:06:04.566 --> 00:06:07.188]  You see it on cable news, you talk about it on Twitter.
[00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:12.753]  The result may feel like a debate, but actually the gatekeepers are still in charge.
[00:06:13.654 --> 00:06:15.055]  We think that's a bad system.
[00:06:15.635 --> 00:06:18.398]  We know exactly how it works and we're sick of it.
[00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:24.363]  Starting soon, we'll be bringing a new version of the show we've been doing for the last six and a half years to Twitter.
[00:06:25.137 --> 00:06:27.079]  We bring some other things too, which we'll tell you about.
[00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:29.161]  But for now, we're just grateful to be here.
[00:06:29.861 --> 00:06:32.283]  Free speech is the main right that you have.
[00:06:32.784 --> 00:06:34.365]  Without it, you have no others.
[00:06:35.066 --> 00:06:35.526]  See you soon.
[00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.369]  Wow.
[00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:40.131]  That is so powerful.
[00:06:40.591 --> 00:06:41.452]  So iconic.
[00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:47.878]  Way better than Tucker in some fancy studio, but in his house, talking directly to the people.
[00:06:48.298 --> 00:06:59.569]   That's what humanity is looking for in his His real focus on justice and freedom and unifying left and right and creating a pro-human populist movement is so beautiful.
[00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:00.890]  It's what we're all looking for.
[00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.432]  So again, we salute Tucker Carlson.
[00:07:03.832 --> 00:07:05.213]  We salute Elon Musk for this.
[00:07:05.613 --> 00:07:06.934]  This is such an exciting moment.
[00:07:07.214 --> 00:07:11.778]  It's gonna have tens of millions of viewers a day, probably hundreds of millions.
[00:07:12.278 --> 00:07:15.901]  And this is just an example of how evil's not the only power in the world.
[00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:16.842]  Freedom.
[00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:22.856]  Is way more powerful if we exercise it, but we've got to exercise it.
[00:07:23.256 --> 00:07:25.898]  So for myself and the crew, we salute her Carlson.
[00:07:26.418 --> 00:07:28.360]  We salute listeners and viewers for what we've done together.
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.841]  This is a historic time.
[00:07:29.861 --> 00:07:32.083]  This is the new Renaissance being born right now.
[00:07:32.443 --> 00:07:34.344]  And I'll see you live weekdays, 11 a.m.
[00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:36.586]  at info wars.com for his last show.
[00:07:36.626 --> 00:07:42.366]   You better believe we'll be covering Tucker's new exploits that are about to drop and about to make the globals pull
[00:07:42.366 --> 00:07:43.626]  their hair out.
[00:07:43.626 --> 00:07:53.626]  [Intro Music]
[00:07:53.626 --> 00:07:59.626]   Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[00:07:59.682 --> 00:08:02.045]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[00:08:02.366 --> 00:08:04.569]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.531]  Period.
[00:08:05.731 --> 00:08:06.492]  Case closed.
[00:08:06.833 --> 00:08:07.954]  Out to get you and your family.
[00:08:08.195 --> 00:08:16.126]   We shall The Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour Group, it's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:08:16.466 --> 00:08:28.862]   They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[00:08:29.222 --> 00:08:30.503]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:33.085]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:38.470]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:44.215]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:08:44.255 --> 00:08:45.876]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:08:45.916 --> 00:08:47.297]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:08:47.498 --> 00:08:48.859]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:51.661]  The point is, you can get the filters at Infowarstore.com.
[00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:52.542]  They're discounted right now.
[00:08:52.802 --> 00:08:53.523]  Finally back in stock.
