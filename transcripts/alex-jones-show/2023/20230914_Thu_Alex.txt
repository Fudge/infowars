[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.893]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:00:04.273 --> 00:00:06.015]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:00:06.095 --> 00:00:09.919]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.041]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:16.105]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:18.167]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:00:18.607 --> 00:00:19.888]  But you don't have a choice.
[00:00:19.948 --> 00:00:21.269]  People act like you have a choice.
[00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.374]  People don't feel like going to the stadium when they might get infected.
[00:00:27.654 --> 00:00:32.418]  You know, it's not the government who's saying, OK, just ignore this disease.
[00:00:32.538 --> 00:00:40.724]  And, you know, people are deeply affected by seeing these deaths, by knowing they could be part of the transmission chain.
[00:00:40.764 --> 00:00:46.249]  And, you know, old people, their parents, their grandparents could be affected by this.
[00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:53.636]   And so you don't You don't get to say, ignore what's going on here.
[00:00:54.256 --> 00:01:01.340]  There will be the ability, particularly in rich countries, to open up if things are done well over the next few months.
[00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:12.246]  But for the world at large, normalcy only returns when we've largely vaccinated the entire global population.
[00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:17.842]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:19.924]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:01:20.684 --> 00:01:25.749]  Again, we have experience with this type of vaccine in billions of people.
[00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.570]  It's a safe vaccine.
[00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.936]  Of course, with the mRNA, there's a very, very, very low risk, particularly in young men, of getting a myocarditis.
[00:01:35.357 --> 00:01:42.903]  But if you look at the risk of myocarditis from COVID itself is greater than the risk of the vaccine.
[00:01:43.442 --> 00:01:47.246]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:01:47.626 --> 00:01:49.348]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.151]  And cue that back up to the last 10 seconds of Bill Gates.
[00:01:54.252 --> 00:01:54.753]  What did he say?
[00:01:54.773 --> 00:01:58.176]  The only way you go back to normal is you take the shot because it protects you.
[00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:02.300]  But now they say the shot doesn't protect you.
[00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:06.264]  In fact, it destroys your immune system and makes you sicker.
[00:02:07.113 --> 00:02:09.293]  New York Governor Hochul pushes new COVID jabs.
[00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:11.934]  Don't rely on previous vaccines.
[00:02:12.114 --> 00:02:16.155]  Will not help you this time around, says Dr. Hochul.
[00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:20.356]  They are exercising gaslighting.
[00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:22.996]  They are lying to you about everything.
[00:02:24.217 --> 00:02:27.217]  And that's why even Greg Gutfeld came out and said, OK, I'm Alex Jones now.
[00:02:27.257 --> 00:02:27.857]  It's all true.
[00:02:28.938 --> 00:02:30.218]  It is all true, people.
[00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:40.083]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:02:39.923 --> 00:02:41.923]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:44.923]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:02:45.923 --> 00:02:48.923]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:02:48.923 --> 00:02:57.923]   Steve Favis is an expert in computer science and advanced robotics.
[00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:07.209]  He has been researching the Maui fires and has compiled evidence that the technology exists to have started these fires from a satellite in Earth orbit.
[00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.980]  He has also confirmed that the CCP had satellites capable of doing so above Maui at the time of the fires.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.471]  His work has been published on his website, stevefavis.com, and includes everything you need to recreate these findings.
[00:03:24.572 --> 00:03:35.438]  The most efficient way to ignite a fire on the surface from a satellite in Earth orbit would be to paint the target in segments by pulsing the laser with an advanced targeting system.
[00:03:36.078 --> 00:03:43.182]  To see if this were possible, FAVAS calculated what it would require to create a meter-wide, mile-long fire.
[00:03:44.022 --> 00:03:49.644]  Fired from a satellite, the Earth's atmosphere will absorb and scatter some of the laser energy.
[00:03:50.144 --> 00:03:54.465]  And so the laser would need to be in a wavelength range that minimizes this.
[00:03:55.125 --> 00:04:01.947]  The most effective wavelength would be in the near-infrared range, which would allow better transmission through the atmosphere.
[00:04:02.628 --> 00:04:12.511]  The near-infrared range would be invisible to the naked eye, and would also have a minimal reaction with objects colored blue on the Earth's surface.
[00:04:14.031 --> 00:04:24.758]  The power of the laser would need to be in the hundreds of kilowatts range, and so Favas based his calculations on a 10 megawatt laser firing from Earth orbit.
[00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:38.687]  Assuming that the atmospheric loss amounts to 50% of the overall power, and only 5 megawatts reaches the surface as a 1 square meter beam, it would ignite a fire almost instantly.
[00:04:39.748 --> 00:04:52.411]  If this 5 megawatt beam was pulsed across a 1 meter by 1 mile long area in segments, then the time to ignite the entire area would be roughly 2.7 minutes.
[00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:59.213]  And it would only take approximately 8.8 seconds to melt an aluminum alloy wheel.
[00:05:00.013 --> 00:05:11.493]   The amount of energy required to pulse a 10 megawatt laser for 2.7 minutes would require approximately 3,220 capacitors,
[00:05:11.493 --> 00:05:16.892]  which would amount to about 32,200 kilograms in weight.
[00:05:16.892 --> 00:05:22.372]   Using Met Lab software and plugging in public data provided from NORAD,
[00:05:22.372 --> 00:05:31.813]   he found that satellites launched and monitored by the CCP were directly above the Maui fires at the time of ignition.
[00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:45.052]  The CCP's most powerful rocket, the March 5, can launch up to 48,500 kilograms of payload, which is more than enough to carry the required payload in Favus' calculations.
[00:05:45.652 --> 00:05:51.577]  But Favis has found that the CCP has much more powerful lasers deployed already.
[00:05:52.198 --> 00:05:58.844]  He has calculated that the CCP has up to 70 gigawatt lasers in Earth orbit right now.
[00:05:59.524 --> 00:06:05.229]  That's at least a hundred times more powerful than what he factored into these calculations.
[00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:15.897]  Adjusting NORAD's Default Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC, to the local time zones, FAVAS found the following.
[00:06:16.598 --> 00:06:21.361]  The Olinda Fire was ignited at approximately 10.47 p.m.
[00:06:21.802 --> 00:06:22.743]  on August 7th.
[00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:29.468]  At this exact time, CCP satellite labeled NORAD-53299 was directly over the location.
[00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:38.175]  The Lahaina Fire was ignited at approximately 6.37 a.m.
[00:06:38.515 --> 00:06:39.316]  on August 8th.
[00:06:39.917 --> 00:06:45.562]  At this exact time, CCP satellite labeled NORAD 55836 was directly over the location.
[00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:53.792]  The Kula fire was ignited at approximately 1130 a.m.
[00:06:54.252 --> 00:06:55.093]  on August 8th.
[00:06:55.814 --> 00:07:00.961]  At this exact time, CCP satellite labeled NORAD-53299 was directly over the location.
[00:07:04.946 --> 00:07:12.930]  The so-called Deep State does not want you to know that deadly lasers of mass destruction are freely traveling above us.
[00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:26.095]  And you can check this all for yourself at stevefavis.com, where he provides the source code and has developed a specific software program that you can download and check for these satellites yourself.
[00:07:26.936 --> 00:07:29.896]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:07:29.896 --> 00:07:39.896]  [MUSIC]
[00:07:39.896 --> 00:07:51.455]   I told you 20 plus days ago that my source in the TSA and another source in the Border Patrol confirmed that by the
[00:07:51.455 --> 00:07:57.416]   15th of September, they will begin rolling out masking and vaccine mandates in
[00:07:57.416 --> 00:07:59.615]   hospitals and many other areas.
[00:08:00.163 --> 00:08:03.404]  It's now officially been announced everywhere.
[00:08:03.524 --> 00:08:10.327]  I have stacks, more than 50 articles and news reports, and it's not even the 15th yet.
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.300]  The full rollout is here.
[00:08:16.081 --> 00:08:17.521]  Alex Jones wasn't right again.
[00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:19.621]  Alex Jones told the truth again.
[00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:21.662]  It wasn't that I predicted something.
[00:08:22.042 --> 00:08:22.822]  It's a fact!
[00:08:24.823 --> 00:08:26.083]  I wish we could have backed him off.
[00:08:27.123 --> 00:08:29.904]  But now we'll be vindicated again and we won't be caught flat-footed.
[00:08:30.264 --> 00:08:34.785]  Here is the evil, appointed, unelected governor of New York.
[00:08:36.092 --> 00:08:38.477]  Telling you your previous shots didn't work.
[00:08:38.778 --> 00:08:39.660]  You need the new one.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.123]  But it never worked.
[00:08:41.183 --> 00:08:46.655]  And then here's Bill Gates and Fauci has something to tell you as well.
[00:08:48.422 --> 00:08:52.226]  Tell everybody don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:08:52.607 --> 00:08:54.329]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:08:54.429 --> 00:08:58.253]  Tell everybody don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:08:58.634 --> 00:09:00.356]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:04.420]  Tell everybody don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:06.523]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:09:06.923 --> 00:09:08.204]  But you don't have a choice.
[00:09:08.284 --> 00:09:09.604]  People act like you have a choice.
[00:09:10.105 --> 00:09:15.707]  People don't feel like going to the stadium when they might get infected.
[00:09:15.987 --> 00:09:20.750]  You know, it's not the government who's saying, OK, just ignore this disease.
[00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:29.034]  And, you know, people are deeply affected by seeing these deaths, by knowing they could be part of the transmission chain.
[00:09:29.094 --> 00:09:34.576]  And, you know, old people, their parents, their grandparents could be affected by this.
[00:09:34.656 --> 00:09:41.943]   And so you don't You know, you don't get to say, ignore what's going on here.
[00:09:42.584 --> 00:09:49.667]  There will be the ability, particularly in rich countries, to open up if things are done well over the next few months.
[00:09:50.267 --> 00:10:00.571]  But for the world at large, normalcy only returns when we've largely vaccinated the entire global population.
[00:10:02.349 --> 00:10:06.171]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:10:06.532 --> 00:10:08.253]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:10:09.013 --> 00:10:14.076]  Again, we have experience with this type of vaccine in billions of people.
[00:10:14.557 --> 00:10:15.897]  It's a safe vaccine.
[00:10:16.017 --> 00:10:23.242]  Of course, with the mRNA, there's a very, very, very low risk, particularly in young men, of getting a myocarditis.
[00:10:23.682 --> 00:10:31.227]  But if you look at the risk of myocarditis from COVID itself is greater than the risk of the vaccine.
[00:10:31.772 --> 00:10:35.574]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:10:35.954 --> 00:10:37.675]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:10:38.795 --> 00:10:41.477]  And cue that back up the last 10 seconds of Bill Gates.
[00:10:42.577 --> 00:10:43.057]  What did he say?
[00:10:43.097 --> 00:10:46.499]  The only way you go back to normal is you take the shot because it protects you.

[00:10:55.438 --> 00:10:57.619]  New York Governor Hochul pushes new COVID jabs.
[00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:00.260]  Don't rely on previous vaccines.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.482]  Will not help you this time around, says Dr. Hochul.
[00:11:06.243 --> 00:11:08.684]  They are exercising gaslighting.
[00:11:08.764 --> 00:11:11.325]  They are lying to you about everything.
[00:11:12.545 --> 00:11:15.527]  And that's why even Greg Gutfeld came out and said, OK, I'm Alex Jones now.
[00:11:15.587 --> 00:11:16.207]  It's all true.
[00:11:17.267 --> 00:11:18.548]  It is all true, people.
[00:11:21.209 --> 00:11:22.670]  My uncle saw the U.S.
[00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:31.377]  government smuggling children out of Guatemala, out of orphanages, to God knows where, 40 years ago.
[00:11:34.059 --> 00:11:35.320]  This didn't just start.
[00:11:36.681 --> 00:11:38.503]  I don't need to see it in the news or read about it.
[00:11:38.703 --> 00:11:46.189]  My uncle, who was Mr. America, Mr. Captain America, Mr. Boy Scout, saw it, stood up against it.
[00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:49.531]  They tried to kill him.
[00:11:49.551 --> 00:11:51.993]   They did kill The officer under him.
[00:11:54.694 --> 00:11:56.655]  That's how real this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:58.797 --> 00:12:00.318]  And that's where we are.
[00:12:01.979 --> 00:12:03.940]  This is the reality today.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.742]  We are faced with pure evil that's hijacked our government.
[00:12:10.144 --> 00:12:11.545]  Play the Bill Gates clip just at the end.
[00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:11.845]  Go ahead.
[00:12:14.506 --> 00:12:17.533]   Ignore what's going on here.
[00:12:17.533 --> 00:12:25.033]   There will be the ability, particularly in rich countries, to open up if things are done well over the next few months.
[00:12:25.033 --> 00:12:36.033]   But, for the world at large, normalcy only returns when we've largely vaccinated the entire global population.
[00:12:36.033 --> 00:12:37.033]  And so...
[00:12:37.033 --> 00:12:39.033]  So what do the real studies show?
[00:12:39.033 --> 00:12:43.533]   You are five times more likely to get sick, four times more likely to be hospitalized,
[00:12:43.533 --> 00:12:47.533]   and more than ten times more likely to die if you're exposed to COVID,
[00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.533]  if you've been what?
[00:12:49.533 --> 00:12:51.533]  If...
[00:12:50.932 --> 00:12:51.953]  If you've been what?
[00:12:52.233 --> 00:12:57.438]  V-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-vaccinated and it's not even a vaccine.
[00:12:58.649 --> 00:13:06.134]  What did the head of the British government group say two and a half years ago when the shots rolled out on national television?
[00:13:06.354 --> 00:13:09.056]  It was actually on Canadian TV, it was out of the UK.
[00:13:11.838 --> 00:13:21.844]  He said, oh, we found when you take one of these shots, mRNA, it lowers your immune system, but by three, you have almost no antibodies and you'll have to have future shots all the time.
[00:13:21.864 --> 00:13:24.546]  So I'm going to say it very slowly.
[00:13:25.743 --> 00:13:29.666]  All the studies, all the evidence shows it never protected you.
[00:13:29.846 --> 00:13:31.607]  It always made you more susceptible.
[00:13:32.007 --> 00:13:33.268]  It always made you sicker.
[00:13:33.368 --> 00:13:36.350]  It always statistically killed you more often.
[00:13:38.091 --> 00:13:39.893]  And you know, Rachel Maddow read the talking point.
[00:13:40.373 --> 00:13:42.434]  If you have the shot, you can't get it, you can't spread it.
[00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:43.735]  What did Biden say?
[00:13:44.035 --> 00:13:45.957]  You got the shot, you can't spread it, you can't get it.
[00:13:46.877 --> 00:13:48.318]  He was still saying that two years ago.
[00:13:49.199 --> 00:13:55.283]  Now, hear the record skip, hear the car wreck sound, hear the alarm.
[00:13:56.328 --> 00:13:57.188]  Nope, sorry.
[00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:01.509]  No.
[00:14:03.169 --> 00:14:04.530]  The shot won't help you.
[00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:09.811]  Now, you may have just tooken one of these dumb things six months ago.
[00:14:10.491 --> 00:14:12.571]  Sorry!
[00:14:12.671 --> 00:14:14.092]  Doesn't protect you!
[00:14:14.812 --> 00:14:21.193]  In fact, you get sicker when you had them before, and that's what you're about to find out.
[00:14:22.972 --> 00:14:34.601]  And when the idiots go out and take it again, what are all these different disorders, all these different syndromes, that depending on your physiology, your genetics, you're going to get.
[00:14:34.681 --> 00:14:38.124]  And oh, but don't worry, you know what's causing all the increased heart attacks in Mount Paradise?
[00:14:39.205 --> 00:14:40.185]  It's COVID!
[00:14:40.966 --> 00:14:53.603]   You know, when I knew I was in the twilight zone was a long time ago, but we were protesting the evidence of the stolen election in November of 2000 in Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:14:54.643 --> 00:15:01.345]  And then when the lockdown was still going on, so the streets were basically empty, but we were protesting, and we stayed at the Westin Hotel in downtown.
[00:15:02.185 --> 00:15:03.565]  And I said, oh, there's a nice park down there.
[00:15:03.585 --> 00:15:05.526]  I want to go shoot some reports down there.
[00:15:06.026 --> 00:15:07.806]  So we're out there about an hour shooting reports.
[00:15:07.826 --> 00:15:09.247]  You saw me uploading a Band-Aid video.
[00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:11.187]  We even caught some of the buses on tape.
[00:15:12.947 --> 00:15:15.909]  And I'm sitting there in between shooting reports.
[00:15:15.929 --> 00:15:17.070]  We got some breakfast tacos.
[00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.513]  We're out in the sun, you know, 10 a.m., eating breakfast tacos, sitting back.
[00:15:22.815 --> 00:15:25.998]  Might have had a flash of a little Jamison's in it, being a bad boy after a late night.
[00:15:27.319 --> 00:15:29.100]  And a bus drives by.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:34.625]  And it says, Nanotech in vaccines will save the world and change your life.
[00:15:35.626 --> 00:15:37.347]  This is long before they rolled the shots out.
[00:15:39.228 --> 00:15:39.629]  Or before.
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.140]   and i'm sitting out there and i think it's time that must ask my get it get it
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.221]   get it every chance right so that's the bus travel get the get the basket the box
[00:15:48.221 --> 00:15:52.960]   and i found that one says we didn't catch the other one we get it was it's normal for
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.620]   children and teenagers and heart attacks strokes
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:03.820]   strokes are more and more commonly so they were even and you saw the news you see it the news everywhere
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:09.041]   no strokes in young people were common strokes in no one knows why young people having always
[00:16:09.041 --> 00:16:10.860]   heard that but what part
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:16.911]   but before they even did it we caught because by the time i i'm a nice guy to the crew
[00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:19.941]   except when i get obsessed with something i want to get i didn't get it
[00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:23.350]   so we were out there for hours driving around looking for buses and we did catch them we're
[00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:27.500]   driving by taping them in fact try to see rob do is always the best to find stuff
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:34.441]   so you go into band dot video back to the phoenix stuff and just show those buses or let's do a whole report
[00:16:34.441 --> 00:16:43.176]   because it's all over the news We could show you back in the time, buses, billboards, TV shows, movies, even product placement in the shows.
[00:16:44.016 --> 00:16:46.417]  You're watching some late night hospital show.
[00:16:46.857 --> 00:16:49.718]  It's quite normal that kids have heart attacks now, the doctor says.
[00:16:50.059 --> 00:16:52.740]  It's just, they're even, and so I saw that.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.263]  And I went, oh my God, this is going to cause massive heart attacks.
[00:16:57.684 --> 00:17:01.588]  And right at that time, Dr. Michael Yeadon and all these scientists come out and say it's going to cause massive heart attacks.
[00:17:02.049 --> 00:17:11.420]  And then we learned that in October of that year, a month before, the CDC on their own website and the FDA said it will cause heart attacks.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.781]  Sorry if you had the shots.
[00:17:14.861 --> 00:17:15.781]  They didn't work.
[00:17:15.841 --> 00:17:16.762]  You need more.
[00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:18.782]  Sorry those shots didn't work.
[00:17:18.862 --> 00:17:19.623]  You need more.
[00:17:20.303 --> 00:17:21.783]  What did I tell you three and a half years ago?
[00:17:21.824 --> 00:17:25.845]  Have the Archivist, who's a genius, go back to 2020, 2021.
[00:17:25.905 --> 00:17:29.226]  Just, I don't want, he does like 20-minute videos because there's so many hundreds of times I've said it.
[00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:32.668]  Just get the best ones and make like a two-minute one.
[00:17:32.828 --> 00:17:34.048]  It'll be great for Twitter as well.
[00:17:34.068 --> 00:17:37.349]  Because, you know, a lot of leftists out there, I care about you.
[00:17:37.369 --> 00:17:38.510]  I want you to stop being schmucks.
[00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:39.930]  And stop being scams.
[00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:43.431]  So here's the New York governor yesterday saying, sorry, your shots don't work.
[00:17:44.051 --> 00:17:51.854]  And then here's Mr. Maddow and Obama, excuse me, Biden, it's the same guy, you know, telling you they would work.
[00:17:53.154 --> 00:17:56.975]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:17:57.355 --> 00:17:59.096]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:18:00.176 --> 00:18:00.756]  You're OK.
[00:18:01.016 --> 00:18:04.197]  You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[00:18:04.705 --> 00:18:11.456]  Now we know that the vaccines work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person.
[00:18:12.618 --> 00:18:14.741]  A vaccinated person gets exposed to the virus.
[00:18:16.584 --> 00:18:18.386]  The virus does not infect them.
[00:18:18.486 --> 00:18:21.128]  The virus cannot then use that person to go in.
[00:18:21.548 --> 00:18:25.372]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:18:25.732 --> 00:18:27.473]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:31.397]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:33.518]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:18:33.599 --> 00:18:37.422]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:18:37.802 --> 00:18:39.524]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:18:41.265 --> 00:18:42.126]  Let's play it one more time.
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.604]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:18:47.985 --> 00:18:49.687]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:18:49.987 --> 00:18:50.368]  You know what?
[00:18:50.408 --> 00:18:51.609]  Play it five more times, actually.
[00:18:51.629 --> 00:18:52.009]  Five more.
[00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:56.094]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:18:56.475 --> 00:18:58.217]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:18:58.317 --> 00:19:00.119]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact...
[00:19:00.319 --> 00:19:02.540]  Tell everybody don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:19:02.359 --> 00:19:04.159]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:19:04.159 --> 00:19:08.179]   Tell everybody don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:19:08.179 --> 00:19:10.198]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:19:10.198 --> 00:19:14.198]   Tell everybody don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:19:14.198 --> 00:19:16.198]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:20.238]   Tell everybody don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:19:20.238 --> 00:19:22.238]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:19:22.238 --> 00:19:26.238]   Tell everybody don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:28.291]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:19:28.411 --> 00:19:32.233]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:19:32.593 --> 00:19:34.333]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:19:35.354 --> 00:19:37.994]  And now let's hear... Stop, stop for a minute.
[00:19:38.014 --> 00:19:40.515]  I'm not trying to be obnoxious here, folks.
[00:19:40.795 --> 00:19:41.616]  They're trying to kill us.
[00:19:41.636 --> 00:19:42.416]  They are killing us.
[00:19:42.436 --> 00:19:43.236]  They lied the whole time.
[00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:45.397]  We were 100% dead on, by the grace of God.
[00:19:45.837 --> 00:19:46.797]  We told you it doesn't work.
[00:19:46.857 --> 00:19:47.518]  It makes you sick.
[00:19:47.578 --> 00:19:48.298]  It'll make you get sicker.
[00:19:48.318 --> 00:19:49.198]  It's in all the studies now.
[00:19:49.458 --> 00:19:50.899]  We had top scientists warn us at the time.
[00:19:50.919 --> 00:19:54.180]  And just remember what these murdering criminals did.
[00:19:55.731 --> 00:20:05.076]  And that's why they made sure to get liability protection before they did this, but the UN said, we're not going to inject the illegal alien migrant hordes, whether you're in Europe or here or anywhere.
[00:20:05.176 --> 00:20:18.802]  Oh no, we don't inject our people because the UN under this global project brings them in, signs them up for welfare, gets them jobs, and then skims up to half their paycheck and half their welfare into the leftist parties of each country, Democratic Party here.
[00:20:19.083 --> 00:20:19.563]  It's on record.
[00:20:20.441 --> 00:20:22.482]  They don't want their cash cow killed.
[00:20:22.562 --> 00:20:23.822]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:20:24.162 --> 00:20:25.443]  I mean, later they'll do that.
[00:20:25.503 --> 00:20:26.163]  Don't worry.
[00:20:26.723 --> 00:20:31.785]  But those are their little juicies, like the homeless they promote and then farm.
[00:20:33.485 --> 00:20:42.728]  The average homeless person they're skimming about, they're getting about $100,000 a year through the different leftist agencies that are literally in the buildings in downtown.
[00:20:44.341 --> 00:21:26.837]   LA, downtown, Austin, downtown, San Francisco, downtown Portland, downtown Detroit, downtown New York, downtown Miami, downtown Dallas, downtown Houston, downtown Phoenix, and you go there, and each little leftist will be making 300, 400 grandies a year, and they'll have 30 or 40 homeless under their control, their social workers, with these corporations, and they will then be getting millions of dollars Off of the little group that each person manages, and if you've got a disabled homeless, mentally or physically, 200, 300, 400 smackers, G's, clams, per person!
[00:21:27.918 --> 00:21:32.121]  Farming them, farming them, farming them.
[00:21:32.461 --> 00:21:41.407]  You can get a little kid, tell them they're really a girl and they're a boy, put them on puberty blockers, screw them up, put them on the psychologist, cut their penis off, suck money out until they're 25, they commit suicide.
[00:21:43.763 --> 00:21:52.896]  We got the videos of us saying, just in the surgeries we'll make $400,000 and we'll have a business for life with these kids.
[00:21:56.161 --> 00:22:00.027]  I mean the evil, evil, evil.
[00:22:00.869 --> 00:22:05.111]  Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil.
[00:22:05.751 --> 00:22:08.912]  Should add about 50 more evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evils.
[00:22:09.633 --> 00:22:10.753]  And I know you're an average person.
[00:22:10.773 --> 00:22:11.893]  You want to have a job, family.
[00:22:12.194 --> 00:22:13.054]  You want to go play golf.
[00:22:13.074 --> 00:22:13.854]  You want to go to the movies.
[00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:14.614]  You want to go to church.
[00:22:14.654 --> 00:22:16.655]  You want to, you know, swim in the swimming pool.
[00:22:16.695 --> 00:22:18.756]  You want to, you just want to be a nice person.
[00:22:19.136 --> 00:22:20.097]  Want to go visit grandma.
[00:22:21.537 --> 00:22:23.878]  You don't think like the enemy and that's why they're winning.
[00:22:25.139 --> 00:22:26.259]  I do think like the enemy.
[00:22:27.219 --> 00:22:27.900]  It's what I do.
[00:22:29.076 --> 00:22:31.138]  And I talked to Joe Rogan.
[00:22:31.178 --> 00:22:32.178]  I talked to Tucker Carlson.
[00:22:32.198 --> 00:22:32.959]  I talked to them all.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.761]  And they're like, Alex, come on.
[00:22:37.042 --> 00:22:39.403]  This is like, because they called me and I called them.
[00:22:39.463 --> 00:22:41.425]  We talked and dinner, you know, you name it with Joe.
[00:22:41.445 --> 00:22:43.306]  I'm a dinner with Tucker soon.
[00:22:43.326 --> 00:22:47.000]   But the point is, is that And other things.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.644]  But the issue is that they're like, Alex, we've defeated them.
[00:22:52.245 --> 00:22:52.906]  It's ridiculous.
[00:22:52.946 --> 00:22:55.608]  I'm like, no, you're in a bubble because you're smart and informed.
[00:22:55.969 --> 00:22:57.570]  And by osmosis, you think other people know.
[00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.193]  I said, no, they want to get as many people to take more shots.
[00:23:00.834 --> 00:23:02.595]  They want to be able to have mail-in ballots again.
[00:23:03.256 --> 00:23:08.001]  And they want to get the UN treaty rammed through that's in trouble because it's so tyrannical to take over your health care.
[00:23:08.281 --> 00:23:09.362]  I said, this is real.
[00:23:09.462 --> 00:23:09.823]  Watch it.
[00:23:14.189 --> 00:23:15.489]  Because people know I don't BS.
[00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:24.992]  So you imagine when I broke that news on October 18th, almost a month ago, people called me.
[00:23:27.772 --> 00:23:30.073]  And I called them back and I said, no, this is real.
[00:23:31.973 --> 00:23:34.194]  Well, we know you don't make stuff up.
[00:23:34.254 --> 00:23:34.474]  Really?
[00:23:34.494 --> 00:23:36.054]  I'm like, yeah.
[00:23:37.815 --> 00:23:38.495]  And now here we are.
[00:23:39.735 --> 00:23:40.355]  They did it again.
[00:23:40.955 --> 00:23:42.956]  I mean, I got stacks here of them.
[00:23:44.298 --> 00:23:51.211]  Not just Horchel, or globalist pep-mama, saying that.
[00:23:51.271 --> 00:23:51.792]  It's back!
[00:23:53.896 --> 00:23:56.781]  And this is all over the country, but mainly East Coast, West Coast.
[00:23:57.858 --> 00:24:02.081]  The hospital system imposes draconian mandatory COVID vaccines for healthcare workers.
[00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:05.243]  Noncompliance results in unpaid leave and potential termination.
[00:24:05.843 --> 00:24:15.950]  And now they're saying, oh, and if you want to come to the hospital, you got to have it, or you want a kidney transplant, or you broke your leg, we're going to refuse you care if you ever take an experimental fraud.
[00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.531]  I mean, they're murdering us.
[00:24:19.132 --> 00:24:19.972]  Murder!
[00:24:20.353 --> 00:24:20.993]  Murder!
[00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:21.873]  Red rum!
[00:24:24.175 --> 00:24:24.795]  Red rum!
[00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:25.596]  Red rum!
[00:24:27.028 --> 00:24:28.028]  Let's just murder backwards.
[00:24:29.429 --> 00:24:31.449]  Let me get to the whole stack here for you.
[00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.210]  Then there's other... Whoa.
[00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.591]  I'm done talking about that for now.
[00:24:39.671 --> 00:24:41.412]  Let's just set those aside.
[00:24:41.432 --> 00:24:45.133]  And go to breaky.
[00:24:46.393 --> 00:24:47.053]  And come back.
[00:24:47.854 --> 00:24:49.154]  And talk about getting on the offense.
[00:24:50.746 --> 00:24:54.487]  Matt Gaetz, they try to set him up for pedophile crap, total BS.
[00:24:55.327 --> 00:25:01.389]  Oh, did five years ago on a private jet, was there a 17-year-old girl that you had sex with?
[00:25:01.409 --> 00:25:04.870]  And it turned out that was all made up by a guy that the feds had already charged.
[00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:08.691]  And despite that, he survived, and he gets more hardcore.
[00:25:09.391 --> 00:25:13.833]  And I tell ya, he's been on the show before, and we really like him.
[00:25:13.873 --> 00:25:14.953]  He's really grown up a lot.
[00:25:16.992 --> 00:25:20.415]  And they're scared of him, and he just took McCarthy to the woodshed.
[00:25:20.455 --> 00:25:20.895]  And I agree.
[00:25:21.235 --> 00:25:22.857]  McCarthy's giving lip service.
[00:25:22.877 --> 00:25:23.717]  We've given him enough time.
[00:25:24.678 --> 00:25:25.379]  Told you I'd give him time.
[00:25:26.834 --> 00:25:30.437]  We've given it enough time, and now it's time to remove McCarthy.
[00:25:30.977 --> 00:25:31.938]  We'll talk about that.
[00:25:32.058 --> 00:25:34.360]  Elon Musk says the government's weaponized against the people.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.781]  Wow, he's getting radicalized.
[00:25:36.662 --> 00:25:38.863]  And so much more today.
[00:25:39.024 --> 00:25:40.024]  I am loaded for bear.
[00:25:40.545 --> 00:25:42.186]  Judge Joe Brown is scheduled to join us.
[00:25:42.987 --> 00:25:44.468]  Robert Barnes is scheduled to join us.
[00:25:44.928 --> 00:25:46.069]  And so much more.
[00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:49.552]  It's Thursday, September 14th, 2023.
[00:25:50.052 --> 00:25:53.075]  And the new COVID tyranny rollout happened right on time.
[00:25:53.815 --> 00:25:59.297]  The globalists want to play God and they believe bringing death upon millions puts them in that category.
[00:25:59.938 --> 00:26:05.160]  No, it just puts them in the category of demonic scum that'll be taken out like the garbage in the future.
[00:26:07.261 --> 00:26:07.821]  You're okay.
[00:26:08.101 --> 00:26:11.282]  You're not gonna get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[00:26:11.783 --> 00:26:18.525]  Now we know that the vaccines work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person.
[00:26:19.686 --> 00:26:25.487]   A vaccinated person gets exposed to the virus, The virus does not infect them.
[00:26:25.567 --> 00:26:28.190]  The virus cannot then use that person to go in.
[00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:32.453]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:26:32.813 --> 00:26:34.554]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:26:35.355 --> 00:26:36.316]  Bringer of death!
[00:26:37.196 --> 00:26:38.858]  Bringer of death!
[00:26:38.878 --> 00:26:40.659]  Fauci.
[00:26:43.782 --> 00:26:44.182]  Gates.
[00:26:46.504 --> 00:26:47.765]  All of them are bringers of death.
[00:26:47.785 --> 00:26:49.186]  Yeah, I forgot to send this to the crew.
[00:26:49.206 --> 00:26:51.488]  Or maybe it's in the stack, I missed it.
[00:26:52.452 --> 00:27:01.359]  But The Economist ran a big story yesterday saying Alex Jones has Republicans obsessed with the Rothschilds.
[00:27:03.981 --> 00:27:05.422]  The powerful Rothschild family.
[00:27:05.782 --> 00:27:07.403]  Rothschild's a big name.
[00:27:07.423 --> 00:27:10.926]  There's a lot of Rothschilds, but the ones out of Europe, the ones out of London.
[00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:22.739]  So reprint me that, or you can just look it up, type in Alex Jones Rothschilds, it's all over the news, and they go, oh my god, the Rothschilds have no power, we're nobody, Alex Jones is mean to us, oh my gosh.
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:31.327]  I don't tell you in the article that The Economist is wholly owned by Lord Rothschild.
[00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.532]  That's like when they had some of those State Department people.
[00:27:38.905 --> 00:27:41.027]  Testify that they're not globalists.
[00:27:41.888 --> 00:27:45.671]  The one woman in Congress goes, Alex Jones lies about me and says I'm a globalist.
[00:27:46.411 --> 00:27:47.873]  I don't know what a globalist is.
[00:27:48.693 --> 00:28:04.347]  And it turns out that woman is the deputy head of the Open Society Soros Foundation and she is also the head editor or writer at theglobalist.com.
[00:28:06.923 --> 00:28:10.984]  So here's the Rothschild publication that didn't tell you.
[00:28:11.664 --> 00:28:13.644]  By the way, this is a Rothschild-owned publication.
[00:28:13.704 --> 00:28:14.544]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:28:14.564 --> 00:28:14.804]  Type it in.
[00:28:14.824 --> 00:28:15.945]  Who owns The Economist?
[00:28:15.985 --> 00:28:16.305]  Type it in.
[00:28:20.285 --> 00:28:25.506]  One of the most, quote, elite globalist publications that speaks with the mouth of Satan.
[00:28:28.667 --> 00:28:30.687]  Oh no, the Rothschilds, they don't have any power.
[00:28:30.707 --> 00:28:34.008]  They just own the majority of BlackRock that owns 80-something percent of everything.
[00:28:34.608 --> 00:28:36.108]  They're such nice people.
[00:28:37.227 --> 00:28:41.371]  They want to give us a universal basic income to take care of us and give us bugs to eat.
[00:28:42.413 --> 00:28:42.673]  Wow.
[00:28:45.356 --> 00:28:49.260]  Sir Evelyn Robert de Rothschild.
[00:28:50.681 --> 00:28:51.642]  Economist's Newspaper.
[00:28:52.503 --> 00:28:53.064]  LTD.
[00:28:54.226 --> 00:28:57.327]  The Economist Newspaper Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Economist Group.
[00:28:57.627 --> 00:29:01.048]  Sir Edward Robert Rothschild was chairman of the company from 1789.
[00:29:01.148 --> 00:29:10.291]  Although The Economist has a global emphasis on scope, about two-thirds of 75 staff journalists are based in London, borough of Westminster, and is still owned by the Rothschild family.
[00:29:12.232 --> 00:29:17.153]  But they have no power!
[00:29:20.094 --> 00:29:22.015]  Oh my goody goody gumdrops!
[00:29:23.971 --> 00:29:25.452]  They just think you're so stupid.
[00:29:26.273 --> 00:29:29.196]  See, I have this sickness, according to the Loveless.
[00:29:32.258 --> 00:29:32.999]  I really like you.
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.101]  I like your good stuff, your bad stuff.
[00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:37.042]  I know you so well.
[00:29:37.062 --> 00:29:38.964]  I'm a fan of humanity.
[00:29:38.984 --> 00:29:44.449]  I know if you watch Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino in that movie.
[00:29:44.489 --> 00:29:45.169]  In fact, go find it.
[00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.232]  The devils, I'm a fan of man speech.
[00:29:48.692 --> 00:29:50.414]  The devils, I'm a fan of man speech.
[00:29:54.258 --> 00:29:59.301]  What's that movie about the devil and Keanu Reeves?
[00:30:01.563 --> 00:30:02.443]  The Devil's Advocate.
[00:30:03.824 --> 00:30:04.605]  What a lie!
[00:30:06.786 --> 00:30:08.607]  Jesus Christ is a fan of man.
[00:30:09.428 --> 00:30:10.829]  God created man.
[00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:15.912]  The devil is the accuser who's come to kill, steal, and destroy against man.
[00:30:20.816 --> 00:30:21.336]  Remember that.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.101]  Who wants to depopulate humanity?
[00:30:28.442 --> 00:30:32.124]  I know humanity is like a baby finger painting and making messes.
[00:30:32.144 --> 00:30:35.625]  I know we got problems, but man, I've seen your heights too.
[00:30:37.126 --> 00:30:38.347]  I know what you're capable of.
[00:30:38.527 --> 00:30:39.368]  I know what I'm capable of.
[00:30:39.848 --> 00:30:40.908]  Incredible stuff.
[00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:43.290]  I've done things I don't even say on air.
[00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.930]  People wouldn't believe it.
[00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:45.991]  And I know you've got the same potential I've got.
[00:30:50.193 --> 00:30:50.834]  I bet on you.
[00:30:52.155 --> 00:30:52.755]  You bet on me.
[00:30:55.322 --> 00:30:56.083]  They bet against you.
[00:30:57.724 --> 00:30:59.065]  So you know what I say to the New World Order?
[00:31:00.386 --> 00:31:02.247]  Fuck you and your depopulation.
[00:31:02.587 --> 00:31:05.890]  You want people to die, you kill yourselves first and show us how it's done.
[00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:07.471]  Oh, but you don't want to die.
[00:31:07.771 --> 00:31:10.293]  You want us to die so you can exercise your power.
[00:31:12.755 --> 00:31:18.039]  So fuck the Rothschilds and fuck the economists and fuck the New World Order horse they rode in on.
[00:31:20.051 --> 00:31:23.113]  And Fiona Hill doesn't know what a globalist is.
[00:31:23.853 --> 00:31:26.595]  She just is the deputy head of the major foundation that runs it all.
[00:31:27.856 --> 00:31:29.777]  As one of the chief people at the globalists.
[00:31:31.118 --> 00:31:34.780]  They insult your intelligence, and when you let them do it, they win.
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.882]  That's why men say, Alex, come over.
[00:31:39.543 --> 00:31:46.167]  We got some NFL players, and we're gonna go watch, you know, some football reruns today.
[00:31:47.468 --> 00:31:48.249]  I say, no thanks.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.701]  I'm not impressed by UFC heavyweight champions.
[00:31:51.761 --> 00:31:53.721]  I'm not impressed by Tyson Fury.
[00:31:53.761 --> 00:31:55.162]  I'm not impressed by Mike Tyson.
[00:31:55.522 --> 00:31:57.262]  I'm not impressed by any of that crap.
[00:31:57.482 --> 00:32:02.024]  Because men aren't supposed to spend their time looking at simulated war and getting obsessed with that.
[00:32:02.244 --> 00:32:05.605]  You're supposed to spend your time in reality.
[00:32:05.745 --> 00:32:18.289]  And the instincts you have for calculus and plays and information, like a football game or a basketball game, is what you're meant to do in business, in life, in your family, in your country, in your nation, in your world, in your people.
[00:32:19.844 --> 00:32:22.347]  And look, I like Mike Tyson because he's anti-globalist now.
[00:32:22.668 --> 00:32:25.070]  And I've been on his show and he's been on mine.
[00:32:25.291 --> 00:32:29.276]  I like Mike Tyson, but I don't care that Mike Tyson can knock people's heads off.
[00:32:30.219 --> 00:32:37.143]  The real war is understanding the globalist operation and its energy and is building our own systems in a pro-human future.
[00:32:37.403 --> 00:32:42.606]  The real war is getting our sperm count that's 90 plus percent down back to full power.
[00:32:43.407 --> 00:32:45.568]  The real war is getting cancer levels down.
[00:32:45.848 --> 00:32:48.470]  The real war is getting test scores up.
[00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:52.372]  The real war is increasing food output and exploration.
[00:32:53.953 --> 00:32:54.833]  Because I'm a fan of man.
[00:32:55.454 --> 00:32:57.215]  Do you guys find Devil's Advocate fan of man's speech?
[00:33:00.273 --> 00:33:00.993]  Play the speech.
[00:33:02.694 --> 00:33:03.214]  Who are you?
[00:33:03.794 --> 00:33:04.294]  Who am I?
[00:33:05.474 --> 00:33:05.775]  Who are you?
[00:33:06.075 --> 00:33:06.615]  What are you?
[00:33:09.236 --> 00:33:09.416]  Oh!
[00:33:10.596 --> 00:33:11.856]  I have so many names!
[00:33:14.517 --> 00:33:14.877]  See?
[00:33:17.897 --> 00:33:18.897]  Call me Dad.
[00:33:18.897 --> 00:33:24.897]  Vanity!
[00:33:25.609 --> 00:33:27.630]  It's definitely my favorite sin.
[00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:31.051]  Who are you carrying all those bricks for, anyway?
[00:33:31.951 --> 00:33:32.331]  God?
[00:33:33.472 --> 00:33:33.992]  Is that it?
[00:33:34.852 --> 00:33:35.252]  God?
[00:33:36.233 --> 00:33:36.973]  Well, I tell you.
[00:33:37.413 --> 00:33:40.614]  Let me give you a little inside information about God.
[00:33:41.414 --> 00:33:42.775]  God likes to watch.
[00:33:43.335 --> 00:33:44.155]  He's a prankster.
[00:33:44.755 --> 00:33:45.296]  Think about it.
[00:33:46.356 --> 00:33:48.997]  He gives man instincts.
[00:33:50.287 --> 00:33:53.671]  He gives you this extraordinary gift, and then what does he do?
[00:33:53.771 --> 00:34:03.703]  I swear, for his own amusement, his own private cosmic gag reel, he sets the rules in opposition.
[00:34:04.203 --> 00:34:05.344]  It's the goof of all time.
[00:34:05.785 --> 00:34:07.247]  Look, but don't touch.
[00:34:09.689 --> 00:34:11.612]  Touch, but don't taste.
[00:34:13.632 --> 00:34:14.092]  Taste!
[00:34:14.553 --> 00:34:15.173]  Don't swallow.
[00:34:16.994 --> 00:34:20.017]  And while you're jumping from one foot to the next, what is he doing?
[00:34:20.937 --> 00:34:24.160]  He's laughing his sick fucking ass off!
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.801]  He's a tight ass!
[00:34:26.161 --> 00:34:27.562]  He's a sadist!
[00:34:28.583 --> 00:34:30.865]  He's an absentee landlord!
[00:34:31.265 --> 00:34:33.126]  Worship that never!
[00:34:34.267 --> 00:34:36.489]  Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven, is that it?
[00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.790]  Why not?
[00:34:38.937 --> 00:34:42.980]  I'm here on the ground with my nose in it since the whole thing began!
[00:34:44.261 --> 00:34:47.983]  I've nurtured every sensation man has been inspired to have!
[00:34:48.723 --> 00:34:52.025]  I cared about what he wanted and I never judged him.
[00:34:52.286 --> 00:34:52.606]  Why?
[00:34:52.886 --> 00:34:54.447]  Because I never rejected him!
[00:34:54.807 --> 00:34:58.530]  In spite of all his imperfections, I'm a phantom man!
[00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:01.391]  I'm a humanist.
[00:35:02.452 --> 00:35:03.793]  Maybe the last humanist.
[00:35:05.239 --> 00:35:11.821]  Who in their right mind, Kevin, could possibly deny the 20th century was entirely mine?
[00:35:12.961 --> 00:35:14.201]  All of it, Kevin!
[00:35:15.622 --> 00:35:16.042]  All of it!
[00:35:17.382 --> 00:35:17.762]  Mine!
[00:35:19.663 --> 00:35:20.543]  I'm peaking, Kevin.
[00:35:22.123 --> 00:35:23.183]  It's my time now.
[00:35:25.284 --> 00:35:25.964]  It's our time.
[00:35:26.564 --> 00:35:27.264]  None of that's true.
[00:35:27.284 --> 00:35:29.245]  And you know it.
[00:35:30.211 --> 00:35:35.433]  God gave you these instincts and will to build and to challenge and to serve good.
[00:35:36.134 --> 00:35:38.235]  You can turn those instincts towards evil.
[00:35:38.875 --> 00:35:43.637]  You've got to be tested before you get out of boot camp and make the big jump.
[00:35:44.457 --> 00:35:46.418]  And the big guy's taking me to the next level.
[00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:47.619]  The third heaven.
[00:35:48.219 --> 00:35:49.399]  I've seen the operation.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.520]  Indescribable.
[00:35:52.461 --> 00:35:53.661]  You want to make the jump.
[00:35:54.462 --> 00:35:55.882]  Let me do this before we go any further.
[00:35:56.042 --> 00:35:57.083]  I want to find the operation.
[00:35:58.444 --> 00:36:01.445]  You know, you notice I told you lockdowns are coming and controls, they're here.
[00:36:01.465 --> 00:36:04.326]  You notice I told you all of the stuff that's going on.
[00:36:05.646 --> 00:36:12.508]  And you can sit here and look at me that works 18 hours a day and say, that guy doesn't look the healthiest.
[00:36:13.129 --> 00:36:14.349]  Why is he selling supplements?
[00:36:14.429 --> 00:36:20.991]  Well, I mean, just because I know about jog five miles a day and went to the weights for two hours a day and maybe did some yoga, I'd be in better shape.
[00:36:21.771 --> 00:36:23.632]  But I know what's good.
[00:36:24.232 --> 00:36:24.952]  I know what's bad.
[00:36:25.052 --> 00:36:26.693]  And I couldn't do what I do without these products.
[00:36:27.878 --> 00:36:29.518]  These are things that are game-changing.
[00:36:29.778 --> 00:36:44.442]  The very best you're going to find, and they fund this operation, show the only way you fail is not supporting yourself and your own future and your own body, and this broadcast that is 110% pro-human, because we're pro-God.
[00:36:45.622 --> 00:36:49.503]  Humanism is a fake cosmology that's led into globalism that's anti-human.
[00:36:49.683 --> 00:36:54.324]  The people telling you, oh, they want to empower humanity and give you everything you want, that's been the lie the last hundred years.
[00:36:54.684 --> 00:36:56.645]  The 20th century wasn't the century of the devil.
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:12.485]  It was a century of humans discovering how powerful we are, and the incredible pre-ordained, programmed information and gifts we have to unlock the secrets of the universe.
[00:37:13.225 --> 00:37:29.444]   And Satan's jealous of that, because we are, not in larval form, but in our more advanced third-dimensional form, way more powerful than that species of Goblin creature.
[00:37:30.665 --> 00:37:31.847]  Galactic space junk.
[00:37:32.367 --> 00:37:33.769]  Interdimensional trash.
[00:37:35.531 --> 00:37:36.092]  The garbage.
[00:37:37.353 --> 00:37:37.854]  The failure.
[00:37:39.556 --> 00:37:40.277]  And it's jealous.
[00:37:41.739 --> 00:37:42.440]  It's envious.
[00:37:43.301 --> 00:37:44.142]  It's not your fan.
[00:37:44.722 --> 00:37:45.904]  It's your enemy.
[00:37:48.072 --> 00:37:52.195]  And as soon as you start loving yourself, you'll understand that, oh, who made me?
[00:37:52.475 --> 00:38:05.485]  Oh, I love the one that made me and created this fantastic adventure of consciousness that we have been endowed to be part of in the adventure if we choose it.
[00:38:06.606 --> 00:38:13.471]   So, if you took three of our products, That's so hard to say, only three.
[00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:15.513]  I mean, X2 and X3 are great too, but they're sold out.
[00:38:16.514 --> 00:38:17.996]  But these are right there with it.
[00:38:18.336 --> 00:38:25.123]  These three products, if you take them every day, will change your life and will blow you away.
[00:38:27.286 --> 00:38:31.350]  Now, just like you tune in to hear me say something and it comes true, this is exactly the same.
[00:38:32.995 --> 00:38:38.359]  Most supplement companies give you, because all concentrated stuff that God gave us can do different amazing things.
[00:38:38.739 --> 00:38:41.100]  That's where drugs came from, is from natural compounds.
[00:38:41.601 --> 00:38:42.962]  And the system doesn't want you to know about all this.
[00:38:43.642 --> 00:38:58.372]  One of the ingredients in this was the number one prescribed drug, it's legal, it's over the counter, from the 1920s when they discovered it until the 80s when they no longer made it a drug because it was so long off patent.
[00:39:00.713 --> 00:39:01.574]  One of the ingredients.
[00:39:02.785 --> 00:39:13.571]  In this, Real Red Pill, finally back, sold out for many months, has preglanone, which is naturally created in our bodies, but there's so many artificial hormones that it binds to preglanone.
[00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:29.797]   Even if you're producing enough preglanone, whether you're 10 years old or 50 or 80, from the metabolic research that's out there, look into it, the average person's not producing enough preglanone and it's being bound up So you're not getting it.
[00:39:29.997 --> 00:39:35.958]  It's what all your hormones are made out of, your body produces it, and it was the number one arthritis drug.
[00:39:36.659 --> 00:39:37.579]  We don't even sell it for that.
[00:39:38.799 --> 00:39:41.760]  Until they said, get rid of that, it works too good.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:46.561]  Because it's just the raw, over-the-counter hormone.
[00:39:50.081 --> 00:39:53.822]  Now that's just one ingredient in this sweetened pie.
[00:39:56.163 --> 00:40:01.055]   I had top medical doctors Tell me about this a decade ago.
[00:40:02.736 --> 00:40:04.616]  It will blow you away.
[00:40:04.836 --> 00:40:05.936]  Takes a few weeks to kick in.
[00:40:07.917 --> 00:40:08.657]  It's back in stock.
[00:40:09.137 --> 00:40:09.637]  25% off.
[00:40:11.618 --> 00:40:12.558]  DNA Force Plus.
[00:40:13.158 --> 00:40:17.339]  Do I have to tell you PQQ and CoQ10 and every ingredient here is on record?
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.320]  It's certified to make your telomeres last longer?
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.061]  Doesn't grow your DNA, because it only has so many replications.
[00:40:25.481 --> 00:40:27.722]  It just makes them last longer, which is basically the same thing.
[00:40:28.447 --> 00:40:29.909]  Do I need to tell you all about this?
[00:40:33.094 --> 00:40:35.137]  This is powerful and expensive to make.
[00:40:36.599 --> 00:40:41.186]  The average supplement maker gives you some stuff that works okay, but marks it up five times.
[00:40:41.727 --> 00:40:42.448]  We don't do that.
[00:40:45.765 --> 00:40:51.948]  And then, of course, the strongest turmeric on the market, body's ultimate turmeric formula, 95% cuminoid.
[00:40:52.048 --> 00:40:55.890]  Do I need to spend an hour telling you what turmeric and the other ingredients do?
[00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:57.770]  No, we've got news to cover.
[00:40:58.471 --> 00:41:03.193]  But you need to go research these products and you need to get them now.
[00:41:04.493 --> 00:41:10.036]  Not just because it funds this operation and lets us stand against the entire assault of the New World Order.
[00:41:11.189 --> 00:41:14.490]  But because you'll then go, my gosh, Alex Jones was right again.
[00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:15.410]  Like all these callers.
[00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:16.430]  I don't ask callers to call in.
[00:41:16.471 --> 00:41:18.811]  In fact, half the time I say, stop plugging the products.
[00:41:19.451 --> 00:41:20.852]  Because I'm like, we got news to cover.
[00:41:20.872 --> 00:41:21.952]  I want to talk about this topic.
[00:41:22.212 --> 00:41:23.873]  Well, I just got to say, this changed my life.
[00:41:24.713 --> 00:41:26.833]  These are the very best there are.
[00:41:27.654 --> 00:41:28.854]  Real Red Pill Plus back in.
[00:41:29.254 --> 00:41:30.134]  All three of these are in.
[00:41:32.655 --> 00:41:33.355]  The Trifecta.
[00:41:34.516 --> 00:41:35.456]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:41:36.673 --> 00:41:37.613]  And it keeps us on air.
[00:41:37.653 --> 00:41:39.594]  So it's just a win-win-win.
[00:41:40.654 --> 00:41:46.997]  It is a true statement to say, the only way you fail is not getting the product and taking it.
[00:41:50.878 --> 00:41:55.080]  And let me speak to that before I get to Matt Gaetz and the incredible thing he's done before all these big guys come on.
[00:41:58.241 --> 00:42:06.384]  People ask, why would the governor of New Mexico come out last week, last Friday, at a press conference?
[00:42:10.405 --> 00:42:14.588]  And say, I don't care about the Constitution.
[00:42:14.608 --> 00:42:15.809]  I don't care about your Second Amendment.
[00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:19.552]  I'm going to take your guns in a medical emergency with no law.
[00:42:20.273 --> 00:42:21.274]  You go, that's ridiculous.
[00:42:21.314 --> 00:42:21.874]  That's tyranny.
[00:42:21.894 --> 00:42:22.735]  It's going to be overturned.
[00:42:22.775 --> 00:42:23.475]  Well, she's crazy.
[00:42:24.116 --> 00:42:26.598]  They've gotten away with so much, they can't stop trying.
[00:42:26.618 --> 00:42:34.664]  It's like... When Joe Rogan and Eddie Bravo and all of them are talking to me, they're like, Alex, come on.
[00:42:34.724 --> 00:42:36.185]  Everybody knows this is BS.
[00:42:36.205 --> 00:42:37.827]  They're not going to do a new COVID rollout.
[00:42:38.147 --> 00:42:39.048]  I'm like, hey, watch.
[00:42:41.903 --> 00:42:44.444]  Because I don't just know my sources are real, I know the enemy.
[00:42:44.685 --> 00:42:46.646]  They're going to still get 20% of the people to take the shot.
[00:42:47.586 --> 00:42:48.727]  They're still going to hurt a bunch of people.
[00:42:48.907 --> 00:42:50.007]  They're still going to create fear.
[00:42:50.027 --> 00:42:51.188]  They're still going to hurt the economy.
[00:42:51.348 --> 00:42:52.549]  They're still going to try to get their U.N.
[00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:53.009]  treaty through.
[00:42:53.249 --> 00:42:54.330]  Yeah, they're going to do it again.
[00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.692]  So you're like, why is she trying this?
[00:42:58.192 --> 00:42:58.872]  Smackdown.
[00:42:59.212 --> 00:43:03.635]  Federal judge issues temporary restraining order against New Mexico's tyranny.
[00:43:04.395 --> 00:43:04.695]  Which?
[00:43:06.676 --> 00:43:07.417]  Going after the guns.
[00:43:09.974 --> 00:43:12.396]  You know, that I told you two weeks ago, I had no idea she'd do this.
[00:43:12.916 --> 00:43:18.360]  Oh, a governor of a major state's going to just say, I don't need a law banning you having your guns.
[00:43:18.641 --> 00:43:21.743]  You go, Alex, they're not going to do it that nakedly.
[00:43:22.103 --> 00:43:22.483]  Oh, really?
[00:43:22.503 --> 00:43:25.065]  Remember a couple of years ago, CDC said, I don't care.
[00:43:27.207 --> 00:43:29.449]  We're just going to say no rent gets paid anymore.
[00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:31.390]  The Supreme Court slapped it down.
[00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:32.891]  You're like, why'd they try it?
[00:43:32.911 --> 00:43:38.312]  Because they have gotten away with stuff so many times that they're going to try it again.
[00:43:38.672 --> 00:43:40.332]  Now they're not getting away with as much.
[00:43:40.392 --> 00:43:41.453]  That's why they're so pissed.
[00:43:41.873 --> 00:43:45.113]  So the few things they control, like a border, they just go totally wide open.
[00:43:45.914 --> 00:43:46.974]  Or can we have World War III?
[00:43:47.214 --> 00:43:48.154]  That's the power we got.
[00:43:48.194 --> 00:43:50.195]  Let's just go cruise missile the Russians today.
[00:43:53.315 --> 00:43:59.757]  And that's the dangerous paradigm we're in, paradox we're in, fork in the road we're in, crossroads, whatever you want to call it.
[00:44:01.047 --> 00:44:10.376]  Is these lunatics don't stop so it's going to get more fruity, more insane, more wild, more foaming at the mouth, more crazy eyed.
[00:44:12.798 --> 00:44:14.639]  And we may all get killed.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.542]  I mean, I can feel the danger.
[00:44:17.562 --> 00:44:18.343]  I think you can too.
[00:44:19.901 --> 00:44:21.242]  And it's insane.
[00:44:21.642 --> 00:44:23.463]  But that's when elites go insane.
[00:44:24.104 --> 00:44:24.824]  This is what you have.
[00:44:24.844 --> 00:44:29.447]  I mean, think how dumb the Rothschilds are, because they've had endless wealth, quadrillions of dollars.
[00:44:30.728 --> 00:44:31.608]  They own BlackRock.
[00:44:33.269 --> 00:44:35.931]  And they write an article, the Rothschilds have no power.
[00:44:35.951 --> 00:44:36.791]  And it's totally insane.
[00:44:36.811 --> 00:44:37.632]  There's no global elite.
[00:44:37.692 --> 00:44:38.512]  Alex Jones is bad.
[00:44:38.913 --> 00:44:41.534]  They don't even tell you, by the way, the Rothschilds own this publication.
[00:44:45.236 --> 00:44:47.578]  It's like, what?
[00:44:48.769 --> 00:44:49.769]  Or Fiona Hill in Congress?
[00:44:50.189 --> 00:44:50.790]  Or 60 Minutes?
[00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:52.990]  I don't know what a globalist is.
[00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:54.231]  Alex Jones lied about me.
[00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:55.011]  I don't know.
[00:44:56.211 --> 00:44:58.092]  She actually said, I don't know anything about Soros.
[00:44:58.352 --> 00:45:00.653]  You were just the deputy head of his foundation for a decade.
[00:45:01.833 --> 00:45:07.055]  It's like saying, Emmett Smith knows nothing about football.
[00:45:08.155 --> 00:45:09.176]  You're like, uh-huh.
[00:45:09.196 --> 00:45:12.957]  I don't even really follow football anymore, but I know he's an amazing running back.
[00:45:15.922 --> 00:45:19.083]  And they go, well actually Emmett Smith was never on the Dallas Cowboys.
[00:45:19.744 --> 00:45:21.404]  You're like, that's ridiculous.
[00:45:21.484 --> 00:45:22.104]  Of course he was.
[00:45:22.605 --> 00:45:23.725]  They won three Super Bowls with him.
[00:45:24.425 --> 00:45:25.806]  They go, well let me add one more thing.
[00:45:26.706 --> 00:45:28.007]  Emmett Smith's not black.
[00:45:29.327 --> 00:45:31.648]  And you go, well that's... And they go, well we're not done.
[00:45:32.068 --> 00:45:38.631]  The uniform's not white and baby blue and their logo is not a navy blue star.
[00:45:39.131 --> 00:45:41.472]  And you go, well... They just go, ah!
[00:45:43.178 --> 00:45:49.821]  I mean, that is the level... Michael Jordan never played for the Bulls.
[00:45:53.863 --> 00:45:55.603]  The Bulls logo is not a bull.
[00:45:57.824 --> 00:46:00.165]  Magic Johnson never played basketball.
[00:46:00.806 --> 00:46:02.666]  Larry Bird never played for the Celtics.
[00:46:03.307 --> 00:46:05.027]  Babe Ruth never played for the Yankees.
[00:46:06.488 --> 00:46:08.489]  Superman doesn't wear a stupid red cape.
[00:46:10.418 --> 00:46:13.481]  They're just getting you used in your synapse to being lied to.
[00:46:13.581 --> 00:46:14.922]  If you're unconscious, you just give up.
[00:46:15.242 --> 00:46:18.365]  If you're conscious, you go, wait a minute, I get what you're doing.
[00:46:18.925 --> 00:46:20.207]  I see what you're doing.
[00:46:20.227 --> 00:46:21.628]  You get stronger if you're aware.
[00:46:21.988 --> 00:46:25.691]  If your subconscious is in control and you're not conscious, you give up.
[00:46:25.772 --> 00:46:30.075]  When your brain's giving garbage, your brain goes, okay, I don't know what's going on, but I'm done.
[00:46:31.436 --> 00:46:36.261]  This is a very powerful Matt Gaetz clip and I'm going to cover it next hour.
[00:46:37.697 --> 00:46:38.958]  I meant to get to it now, but I didn't.
[00:46:38.978 --> 00:46:42.420]  But this is really important with McCarthy and the impeachment.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:42.940]  What's going on?
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.401]  It is time to remove McCarthy.
[00:46:45.462 --> 00:46:50.965]  They've given him nine valuable months that we didn't have.
[00:46:51.905 --> 00:46:52.586]  Eight and a half months.
[00:46:53.747 --> 00:46:55.548]  And I know MTG said he would do it.
[00:46:55.588 --> 00:46:56.788]  He's acting like he's going to do it.
[00:46:56.828 --> 00:46:57.309]  He's not.
[00:46:57.969 --> 00:46:59.370]  It's time to remove McCarthy.
[00:47:01.611 --> 00:47:04.013]  And Gates has got big eggs.
[00:47:05.574 --> 00:47:10.574]  We're talking ostrich eggs.
[00:47:10.574 --> 00:47:15.413]  We're talking bigger than goose eggs, big giant huevos.
[00:47:15.413 --> 00:47:18.233]  And he's going after 'em.
[00:47:18.233 --> 00:47:21.374]  So that's coming up.
[00:47:21.374 --> 00:47:25.054]   And then we've got all this weird new trend, not just in Ukraine, but in our military.
[00:47:25.054 --> 00:47:32.974]   The commanders and the admiral at the health department, DHS, all of 'em, Health and Human Services,
[00:47:32.974 --> 00:47:38.134]   are weirdo men in dresses talking about war and power and control and chopping
[00:47:38.134 --> 00:47:41.613]  your children's wee-wees off, your ding-a-lings off.
[00:47:41.865 --> 00:47:42.986]  So we've got all that.
[00:47:43.586 --> 00:47:51.452]  And then we've got really amazing comedy material here, if it wasn't so sad, wasn't hurting the average person so much.
[00:47:53.093 --> 00:47:53.393]  U.S.
[00:47:56.215 --> 00:47:57.476]  contacts oil producers.
[00:47:58.857 --> 00:48:02.061]  Refiners and ask them to increase output.
[00:48:03.963 --> 00:48:09.950]  So that's like if I walk up with a hatchet and cut your arms and legs off, you're bleeding out.
[00:48:10.731 --> 00:48:13.274]  Then I asked you, will you have your marrow?
[00:48:13.354 --> 00:48:15.536]  That's where blood's made your bones.
[00:48:15.977 --> 00:48:17.419]  Will you make more blood?
[00:48:19.056 --> 00:48:19.696]  You're already dead.
[00:48:19.797 --> 00:48:22.418]  I've cut your arms and legs off, you bled out, shock, you're dead.
[00:48:22.939 --> 00:48:25.580]  I climbed over the top of the hatchet and I hacked off with hatred.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:30.323]  Your right arm, your left arm, your legs at the hip.
[00:48:30.343 --> 00:48:34.346]  Then I look at you and I go, hey, will you do me a favor?
[00:48:35.967 --> 00:48:38.089]  And I drain the strategic oil reserve.
[00:48:38.529 --> 00:48:41.291]  Will you increase your blood supply?
[00:48:42.391 --> 00:48:47.575]  All your bones a day can maybe produce a quarter of an ounce of blood.
[00:48:48.797 --> 00:48:51.718]  It's the big arms, it's the big bones in your arms, your legs.
[00:48:52.198 --> 00:48:53.659]  But all your bones create blood.
[00:48:54.659 --> 00:48:56.220]  And they're saying, hey, give us some blood.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.861]  What a bunch of sickos, man.
[00:49:01.601 --> 00:49:04.322]  So you read the news, oh, Biden's trying to increase oil production.
[00:49:05.022 --> 00:49:07.123]  Yeah, and monkeys might fly out of my ass.
[00:49:07.943 --> 00:49:08.804]  Power No.
[00:49:08.824 --> 00:49:09.284]  2 straight ahead.

[00:50:30.052 --> 00:50:34.134]   I've been shadowbanned I've been called a liar
[00:50:34.306 --> 00:50:37.727]  I've been silenced on virtually every platform created by man.
[00:50:38.427 --> 00:50:40.747]  My life has been threatened, repeatedly.
[00:50:41.348 --> 00:50:43.888]  They've tried to destroy me, but I've survived.
[00:50:45.069 --> 00:50:47.549]  And that's why I'm joining Mug Club.
[00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:51.550]  The re-platforming begins now!
[00:50:51.750 --> 00:51:07.918]   Join Mug Club and get one month free with promo code ALEX at jonescrowder.com On this very floor in January, the whole world witnessed a historic contest for House Speaker.
[00:51:08.838 --> 00:51:10.839]  I rise today to serve notice.
[00:51:11.219 --> 00:51:17.681]  Mr. Speaker, you are out of compliance with the agreement that allowed you to assume this role.
[00:51:18.341 --> 00:51:29.626]  The path forward for the House of Representatives is to either bring you into immediate total compliance, or remove you pursuant to a motion to vacate the chair.
[00:51:30.646 --> 00:51:36.393]  We have had no vote on term limits or on balanced budgets as the agreement demanded and required.
[00:51:36.433 --> 00:51:38.855]  There's been no full release of the January 6th tapes.
[00:51:39.216 --> 00:51:44.121]  As you promised, there has been insufficient accountability for the Biden crime family.
[00:51:44.381 --> 00:51:50.488]  And instead of cutting spending to raise the debt limit, you relied on budgetary gimmicks and rescissions.
[00:51:51.309 --> 00:51:57.971]  So that you ultimately ended up serving as the valet to underwrite Biden's debt and advance his spending agenda.
[00:51:58.031 --> 00:52:04.954]  Mr. Speaker, you boasted in January that we would use the power of the subpoena and the power of the purse.
[00:52:05.814 --> 00:52:10.236]  But here we are, eight months later, and we haven't even sent the first subpoena to Hunter Biden!
[00:52:10.876 --> 00:52:18.519]  That's how you know that the rushed and, you know, somewhat rattled performance you just saw from the Speaker isn't real.
[00:52:18.819 --> 00:52:23.961]  At this point during Democrat control over the House of Representatives, they had already brought in Don Jr.
[00:52:24.041 --> 00:52:24.781]  three times!
[00:52:25.321 --> 00:52:27.982]  And we haven't even sent the first subpoena to Hunter Biden.
[00:52:28.382 --> 00:52:29.282]  Power of the subpoena.
[00:52:29.322 --> 00:52:30.203]  And power of the purse!
[00:52:30.583 --> 00:52:37.505]  Only thing the 118th Congress is known for at this point is electing Kevin McCarthy's speaker and underwriting Biden's debt.
[00:52:37.805 --> 00:52:41.586]  And unfortunately, there's only one of those things we can remediate at this time.
[00:52:42.267 --> 00:52:43.127]  Power of the purse.
[00:52:43.507 --> 00:52:47.410]  Our leadership right now is asking us to vote for a continuing resolution.
[00:52:47.751 --> 00:53:03.344]  A vote for a continuing resolution is a vote to continue the Green New Deal, a vote to continue inflationary spending, and in the most troubling of fashions, a vote for a continuing resolution is a vote to continue the election interference of Jack Smith.
[00:53:03.725 --> 00:53:06.267]  Mr. Speaker, we told you how to use the power of the purse.
[00:53:06.707 --> 00:53:24.275]  Individual, single-subject spending bills that would allow us to have specific review, programmatic analysis, and it would allow us to zero out the salaries of the bureaucrats who have broken bad, targeted President Trump, or cut sweetheart deals for Hunter Biden.
[00:53:24.955 --> 00:53:30.001]  September 30th is rapidly approaching and you have not put us in a position to succeed.
[00:53:30.281 --> 00:53:33.625]  There is no way to pass all the individual appropriations bills now.
[00:53:33.845 --> 00:53:37.049]  And it's not like we didn't know when September 30th was going to show up on the calendar.
[00:53:38.101 --> 00:53:46.484]  I must be better, you must be better, and this House must be better, for it is the last best hope for tens of millions of Republicans.
[00:53:47.244 --> 00:53:50.805]  We demand real oversight against this weaponized government.
[00:53:51.085 --> 00:53:52.425]  Just look at the bribery!
[00:53:52.986 --> 00:54:03.409]  If tens of millions of dollars flowing from foreign corrupt people into the bank accounts of the Biden family wasn't enough for actual impeachment, why were we even looking?
[00:54:04.369 --> 00:54:12.852]  Joe Biden deserves impeachment for converting the vice presidency into an ATM machine for virtually his entire family.
[00:54:13.272 --> 00:54:13.932]  We all see it.
[00:54:14.353 --> 00:54:14.993]  We all know it.
[00:54:15.673 --> 00:54:20.295]  Now, moments ago, Speaker McCarthy endorsed an impeachment inquiry.
[00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:27.677]  This is a baby step following weeks of pressure from House conservatives to do more.
[00:54:28.297 --> 00:54:29.338]  We must move faster.
[00:54:30.305 --> 00:54:33.866]  Now I will concede that the votes I have called for will likely fail.
[00:54:34.407 --> 00:54:37.408]  Term limits, balanced budgets, maybe even impeachment.
[00:54:38.048 --> 00:54:48.112]  I am prepared for that eventuality because at least if we take votes, the American people get to see who's fighting for them and who's willing to tolerate more corruption and business as usual.
[00:54:48.812 --> 00:54:52.034]  Mr. Speaker, dust off our written January agreement.
[00:54:52.274 --> 00:54:53.054]  You have a copy.
[00:54:53.475 --> 00:54:59.978]  Reflect on the spirit of that agreement and build on the start that we had moments ago.
[00:55:00.579 --> 00:55:02.020]  Begin to comply.
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:04.081]  No continuing resolutions.
[00:55:04.281 --> 00:55:06.122]  Individual spending bills are bussed.
[00:55:06.482 --> 00:55:08.923]  Votes on balanced budgets and term limits.
[00:55:09.244 --> 00:55:14.707]  Subpoenas for Hunter Biden and the members of the Biden family who've been grifting off of this country.
[00:55:14.987 --> 00:55:18.589]  And the impeachment for Joe Biden that he so richly deserves.
[00:55:18.409 --> 00:55:23.409]  Do these things or face a motion to vacate the chair.
[00:55:23.409 --> 00:55:30.409]   And let me alert the country, a motion to vacate might not pass at first, but it might before the 15th vote.
[00:55:31.379 --> 00:55:44.989]  And if Democrats bail out McCarthy, as they may do, then I will lead the resistance to this uniparty and the Biden-McCarthy-Jeffries government that they are attempting to build.
[00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:50.412]  I know that Washington isn't a town where people are known for keeping their word.
[00:55:51.113 --> 00:55:53.755]  Well, Speaker McCarthy, I'm here to hold you to yours.
[00:55:54.615 --> 00:55:55.056]  I yield back.
[00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:59.374]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:55:59.754 --> 00:56:01.477]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:56:01.777 --> 00:56:08.525]  Now we know that the vaccines work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person.
[00:56:09.707 --> 00:56:11.809]  A vaccinated person gets exposed to the virus.
[00:56:13.629 --> 00:56:15.450]  The virus does not infect them.
[00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:19.573]  The virus cannot then use that person to go in.
[00:56:19.613 --> 00:56:20.194]  You're okay.
[00:56:20.454 --> 00:56:23.656]  You're not gonna get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[00:56:23.957 --> 00:56:27.779]  Tell everybody, don't rely on the fact that you had a vaccine in the past.
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:29.861]  It will not help you this time around.
[00:56:30.461 --> 00:56:32.461]  Go to hell, New World Order.
[00:56:32.461 --> 00:56:42.961]  I've got you.
[00:56:43.019 --> 00:56:44.340]  We, uh, ran into some old friends.
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:45.180]  Is she alright?
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:46.701]  Seems okay if we can get to it.
[00:56:46.781 --> 00:56:55.744]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine.

[00:57:42.681 --> 00:57:49.481]  [Music]
[00:57:49.523 --> 00:57:54.428]  Attempts have been made to neutralize the info warrior known as Alex Jones.

[00:58:45.919 --> 00:58:47.081]  He'll have a lot to talk about.
[00:58:47.101 --> 00:58:48.522]  We didn't talk before he came on.
[00:58:48.542 --> 00:58:49.564]  I asked him to come on last week.
[00:58:49.964 --> 00:58:53.889]  I want to pick his brain about the waterfront and talk about where we are today.

[00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:06.849]  It's one of the best barbecue around.
[00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:09.050]  And he also has his barbecue sauce.
[00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:11.091]  You can find that at JudgeJoeBrownShow.com.
[00:59:11.711 --> 00:59:13.491]  Judge, it's great to have you here.
[00:59:13.511 --> 00:59:15.692]  I see your clips all the time.
[00:59:15.712 --> 00:59:18.513]  I feel like, you know, you're part of the family.
[00:59:18.673 --> 00:59:21.774]  I watch you constantly, at least four or five times a week.
[00:59:22.154 --> 00:59:23.154]  Your clips are viral.
[00:59:23.194 --> 00:59:52.755]   But pulling back here, just as an American, as a man, How would you describe where the world is, where America is, and what's going on with the weaponization of the judiciary, the admitted CIA Justice Department surveillance, censorship, the governor saying, I'm going to ban your gun rights with no law, the illegal aliens getting driver's license and able to vote, and they get $10,000 in New York, and somebody on Social Security gets $2,000, the human trafficking.
[00:59:52.815 --> 01:00:15.963]   I mean, it just seems like they're trying to break our will But just like Hitler started bombing civilian targets in England at the beginning of World War II and the Blitz, after World War I, as you know, you're a historian, you're a smart guy, 90 plus percent of the Brits lost family, 90 percent in Poles were against war, because World War I was just a couple decades behind them.
[01:00:16.403 --> 01:00:20.806]  But as soon as Hitler started bombing their houses, it was 99 percent were pro-war.
[01:00:21.907 --> 01:00:27.897]   I don't know why the left thinks attacking us and bullying us I don't know their blind spot, but it's not working.
[01:00:27.917 --> 01:00:32.678]  I can tell you out there in the public, people are waking up fast.
[01:00:32.498 --> 01:00:37.297]   and the fire hoses on black people that just want a right to vote or be able to eat in a restaurant.
[01:00:37.297 --> 01:00:40.818]   And I use that analogy not because you're black, it's just that's the analogy I would use.
[01:00:40.818 --> 01:00:45.137]  I mean, I don't know their blind spot, but it's not working.
[01:00:45.137 --> 01:00:49.847]   I can tell you out there in the public, people are waking up fast. The numbers show that.
[01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:54.398]   So this looks really explosive where this is going. Maybe I'm missing something that the
[01:00:54.398 --> 01:00:59.168]   establishment's missing, why they think they're going to win, or maybe they're just so disconnected with
[01:00:59.168 --> 01:01:03.617]   these airheads like Biden and other people that they can't look at history. Judge Joe Brown, where do
[01:01:03.617 --> 01:01:04.978]  you want to start, my friend?
[01:01:04.978 --> 01:01:09.257]  Okay, let's start right in the middle of the whole thing.
[01:01:09.257 --> 01:01:20.177]   By the way, that [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:01:11.764 --> 01:01:24.669]  Lady Governor out in New Mexico, her most dangerous thing was not that she just unilaterally decided to suspend the Second Amendment, which, hey, that's really out there.
[01:01:24.869 --> 01:01:29.411]  She also declared she was suspending the First Amendment.
[01:01:29.791 --> 01:01:31.252]  That's the really bad one.
[01:01:31.472 --> 01:01:46.351]   But quit thinking of this in terms of Politics as usual, and think about it as a new religion trying to impose itself on the people.
[01:01:46.591 --> 01:01:46.991]  A cult!
[01:01:47.232 --> 01:01:47.652]  A cult!
[01:01:48.613 --> 01:01:48.993]  Cult.
[01:01:49.353 --> 01:01:52.456]  L-G-B-T-Q-I-A plus.
[01:01:53.216 --> 01:01:54.197]  It's a cult.
[01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:56.399]  It's a religion.
[01:01:56.899 --> 01:02:01.023]  But if I can give a little brief explanation... Yes sir, you got the floor.
[01:02:01.083 --> 01:02:03.064]  We're going to break in 17 minutes.
[01:02:03.084 --> 01:02:03.605]  You got the floor.
[01:02:04.306 --> 01:02:19.250]  Okay, no aspersions cast on the religion that I was going to use as an example, but we know there's Christianity, there's Islam, there's Judaism, there's Hinduism, there's Buddhism.
[01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.591]  Now, if you take the Buddhist, you'll notice there's no deity.
[01:02:24.331 --> 01:02:32.513]  It's a system of philosophy, but it is entitled to the respect of a religion, and it's a historic one, it's an ancient one.
[01:02:34.079 --> 01:02:39.303]  LGBTQIA has no deity, but it's a system of philosophy.
[01:02:39.943 --> 01:02:51.331]  And these are new converts who are zealously attempting to force this new religion down everybody's throat and make it the official religion of the country.
[01:02:52.512 --> 01:03:06.325]   If you go to an American building, government building, consulate, Senate, not Senate, embassy, anywhere in the world, No, no, you're right, the Senate too has got the flags everywhere.
[01:03:07.465 --> 01:03:24.417]  And it turned out, just to interrupt, I'll let you take over, but it just came out with a new project, Veritas, but now James O'Keefe with his program, that major corporations tell their employees, you can't wear crosses, and they're like, well why is this LGBT festooned everywhere?
[01:03:24.717 --> 01:03:25.657]  Because it's the religion.
[01:03:25.817 --> 01:03:26.258]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:03:26.798 --> 01:03:37.664]  Yeah, well, yeah, you can't have a nativity scene in City Hall or the courthouse, but you can have a rainbow flag hung from the 11th floor of a federal building in D.C.
[01:03:37.724 --> 01:03:45.269]  put up there by government employees, the sidewalks, crosswalks painted in rainbow.
[01:03:47.036 --> 01:04:05.512]  And you cannot put a cross under the American flag, you can't put a crescent under it, you can't put the mold appointed Jewish star on it, you can't put a Hindu emblem on it, you can't put an image of Buddha under it, but you can put the rainbow according to what they're doing.
[01:04:05.993 --> 01:04:12.098]  They are inculcating the elements of this new secular religion in everything.
[01:04:12.765 --> 01:04:24.068]  And essentially, what they're doing is taking advantage of the fact that in a system like ours, there's always what you call collateral damage.
[01:04:24.568 --> 01:04:27.589]  In other words, being free is not safe.
[01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:36.652]  And there are collateral consequences to maintaining those elements of a system that allows people to be free.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:41.223]  We are known as the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[01:04:41.363 --> 01:04:44.767]  However imperfect we may be in the execution, we are trying.
[01:04:45.187 --> 01:04:45.928]  We'll get there.
[01:04:47.289 --> 01:04:57.058]  But what we have right now is people who are not so brave and they want to be protected because they do not perceive that they can do this themselves.
[01:04:57.938 --> 01:05:08.651]   So when you have people who are so fearful That they are willing to give up their freedom in exchange for safety.
[01:05:09.892 --> 01:05:10.993]  You have a problem.
[01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:30.609]  Now, if you analyze the 20th century, probably the most safe place for anybody outside of being in disfavor or say Jewish or Gypsy was Nazi Germany in the early 30s.
[01:05:32.225 --> 01:05:49.113]  They had probably the lowest crime rate of any society in the Western world at that point, but there were some severe problems with surrendering your personal liberty to some autocrats.
[01:05:50.476 --> 01:05:52.737]  And we have that same thing right now.
[01:05:53.517 --> 01:06:03.142]  Whereas in one instance, it was the National Socialist Workers' Party that we know historically by its acronym, Nazi, N-A-Z-I.
[01:06:04.202 --> 01:06:17.568]  We now have the Rainbow, and they are slowly but surely divesting the country of the rights and protections that we have to ensure freedom.
[01:06:19.485 --> 01:06:30.970]  They have the freedom, the liberty to speak out and exercise their First Amendment rights, but we have to suffer the collateral consequences of the fallout.
[01:06:31.911 --> 01:06:33.831]  They control the media now.
[01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:42.755]  And there is an old thing that the National Socialist Workers Party, aka Nazis, found out long ago.
[01:06:42.835 --> 01:06:52.303]   You tell a lie long enough, Often enough, you can get anyone, including the liar, to believe it.
[01:06:52.943 --> 01:06:57.207]  So we have this spread over and over and over and over again.
[01:06:58.088 --> 01:07:05.155]  Now, let's go back for purposes of illustration of what one of the unrecognized effects of that is.
[01:07:06.156 --> 01:07:20.980]   This person in New Mexico said that she is going to make it unlawful to exercise your Second Amendment rights and your First Amendment rights as well.
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:35.509]  What happens when you do that is you get people arrested for unconstitutional things and there is this phenomenon in American law called the writ of habeas corpus.
[01:07:36.531 --> 01:07:40.132]  It is one of our most important privileges and rights.
[01:07:40.272 --> 01:07:49.595]  In other words, anybody, anywhere can attack the detention of someone, the incarceration of someone.
[01:07:49.615 --> 01:07:51.636]  And doesn't that, sir, go back to Magna Carta?
[01:07:52.716 --> 01:07:54.357]  Yes, but here's the danger.
[01:07:55.549 --> 01:08:02.310]  The writ of habeas corpus in the Constitution cannot be suspended except for two things.
[01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:04.071]  One, invasion.
[01:08:04.991 --> 01:08:06.891]  Two, insurrection.
[01:08:06.911 --> 01:08:14.053]  Have you noticed the way that the press has been throwing the word insurrection out?
[01:08:14.093 --> 01:08:14.453]  Exactly.
[01:08:14.473 --> 01:08:15.953]  They've been using January 6th.
[01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:19.434]  January 6th they've been saying we have an insurrectionist.
[01:08:19.454 --> 01:08:20.914]  They're trying to bring in a civil emergency.
[01:08:22.293 --> 01:08:24.076]  Yeah, all of the insurrections.
[01:08:24.176 --> 01:08:32.848]  So what they're doing is acclimating the public to thinking about any kind of unapproved protest as being an insurrection, which it is not.
[01:08:34.475 --> 01:08:44.904]  And they want us used to the idea that, okay, we're going to declare this an insurrection, even if it's just four people showed up.
[01:08:45.244 --> 01:08:46.205]  And that brings up Owen.
[01:08:46.225 --> 01:08:54.892]  They said, as you know, in his, you probably saw it, I'm guessing you did, in his recommended sentencing document, that he said on his show months ago the election was still stolen.
[01:08:55.272 --> 01:09:01.137]  So they told the judge, we want jail time for him at the Capitol Peaceful because he said the election was stolen.
[01:09:01.157 --> 01:09:03.079]  That seems to me they're crossing a Rubicon.
[01:09:04.201 --> 01:09:04.401]  Yeah.
[01:09:04.681 --> 01:09:29.651]   And by the way, what they're doing against Trump in Georgia, I downloaded the 92 page indictment and frightfully some of what the DA down there did is essentially indicted Trump, forget this, recommending to his followers that they check out Newsmax.
[01:09:30.592 --> 01:09:43.678]  So, what time is it when somebody in an official position uses as the basis for a criminal indictment that you encourage somebody to exercise their First Amendment rights?
[01:09:43.718 --> 01:09:44.718]  What time is it, Judge?
[01:09:44.818 --> 01:09:46.179]  Is it tyranny time?
[01:09:48.396 --> 01:09:51.220]  It's what's going on in the name of religion.
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.806]  In other words, we are imposing something on you for your own good.
[01:09:55.886 --> 01:10:02.174]  Now, 55 years ago, I had a visiting professor emeritus from the University of Moscow.
[01:10:02.314 --> 01:10:03.035]  It was a woman.
[01:10:04.016 --> 01:10:10.367]   At one point in time, Wow, somebody tried to call.
[01:10:10.387 --> 01:10:15.752]  At one point in time, this woman had been head of propaganda for the KGB.
[01:10:15.912 --> 01:10:19.636]  She was a good communist, but she was a visiting professor of Americans.
[01:10:20.376 --> 01:10:25.521]  She was fond of saying that America is in grave danger of becoming a fascist nation.
[01:10:26.622 --> 01:10:33.027]  Not from some, quote, jackboot-wearing, goop-stepping uniform thugs.
[01:10:34.008 --> 01:10:57.667]  But as she put it, from some pink panty wearing, long haired hippies that would be glad to impose the worst elements of fascism on the country to protect themselves from the consequences of their lack of courage and from a misguided thought that they were doing you a favor.
[01:10:58.128 --> 01:11:09.954]   She said, so you must be continually vigilant Uh, in your future in your country, because this is the grave danger that you face.
[01:11:10.674 --> 01:11:20.964]  People taking advantage of your constitution and the liberties that it grants to pervert those liberties into something that destroys your system.
[01:11:21.084 --> 01:11:21.424]  Exactly.
[01:11:21.464 --> 01:11:25.128]  So they take our basic liberties and give us new fake liberties.
[01:11:25.168 --> 01:11:26.009]  So where are we?
[01:11:26.049 --> 01:11:28.411]  How is the... and you mentioned this, I'm going to show it on screen.
[01:11:28.771 --> 01:11:31.714]  The UNWEF have merged last year.
[01:11:32.034 --> 01:11:36.258]  They admit their symbol is actually a rainbow swastika or sun symbol.
[01:11:36.278 --> 01:11:37.239]  That's what swastikas are.
[01:11:37.599 --> 01:11:38.280]  They're not bad.
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:39.681]  The ancient Europeans had them.
[01:11:39.701 --> 01:11:41.623]  The ancient Africans had them.
[01:11:41.643 --> 01:11:43.244]  The ancient Hindus had them.
[01:11:43.504 --> 01:11:46.307]  But their symbol is a rainbow swastika.
[01:11:46.347 --> 01:11:47.268]  You can't make this up.
[01:11:48.499 --> 01:12:05.273]  Well yeah, and see the other thing too, that's even a misnomer because look, if you're going to have a one world government, their theoretical basis for pushing it on the United States or the supporters is Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution.
[01:12:06.694 --> 01:12:20.925]   It says that the United States government is supposed to be committed to, quote, Enforcing the Law of Nations, unquote.
[01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:26.910]  That's in Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution.
[01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:40.361]  The other thing they're relying upon is Article 6 of the Constitution that says, Treaties ratified by the Senate are part of the Supreme Law of the Land along with the Constitution.
[01:12:41.602 --> 01:12:55.180]   Now, We have treaties that we have ratified that are part of the Supreme Law of the Land that this crowd is trying to say obligates us to follow the dictates of the U.N.
[01:12:55.341 --> 01:12:58.403]  That ain't gonna happen if we just say, no, we're not gonna happen.
[01:12:59.084 --> 01:13:03.847]  Interestingly enough, I laugh about this one.
[01:13:03.867 --> 01:13:07.370]  1999, President Bill Clinton negotiated a treaty.
[01:13:08.391 --> 01:13:10.633]  It was ratified by the Senate.
[01:13:12.165 --> 01:13:33.361]  It says the signatories agree to detain, no excuse me, to apprehend, detain, and extradite parties who have been indicted or subject to criminal process by the other signatory.
[01:13:33.441 --> 01:13:35.422]  You know who the other signatory was?
[01:13:35.682 --> 01:13:36.103]  China?
[01:13:36.123 --> 01:13:36.543]  No, Ukraine.
[01:13:37.264 --> 01:13:37.464]  Wow.
[01:13:41.047 --> 01:13:55.485]  In October 2020, early November 2020, the Ukraine Supreme Court ordered a certain multi-page organized crime indictment to be unredacted.
[01:13:56.255 --> 01:14:09.725]  The individuals in question were charged with solicitation of treason, perjury, bribery, extortion, et cetera, et cetera, a number of serious felonies.
[01:14:10.326 --> 01:14:15.410]  Guess who one of the most prominently indicted people was?
[01:14:17.511 --> 01:14:18.272]  Joe Biden.
[01:14:19.244 --> 01:14:31.689]  So technically, under the treaty that's part of the Supreme Law of the land now, Article 6 of the Constitution, Biden's supposed to be apprehended, detained, and extradited to the U.S.
[01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:35.230]  Well, it does seem that Biden's blackmailed, so keep going, Judge, but give me a $35,000.
[01:14:37.311 --> 01:14:39.032]  Now, let me get to the punchline.
[01:14:39.532 --> 01:14:50.896]  Are we in Ukraine for a legitimate purpose, or are we there so Biden can bribe his way out of the indictment so when he's no longer in office he does not get sent over there for prosecution?
[01:14:51.797 --> 01:14:53.177]  Well, let me give you the punchline.
[01:14:53.257 --> 01:14:54.578]  I don't think it's a speculation.
[01:14:54.998 --> 01:14:59.940]  He said five years ago, or longer, he said, I ordered this prosecutor fired or we wouldn't give the money.
[01:15:01.943 --> 01:15:05.208]  $14 billion in loan guarantee.
[01:15:05.228 --> 01:15:10.918]  It was in January and he was sitting at a table with other people on C-SPAN.
[01:15:11.019 --> 01:15:13.884]  I heard it when it was live and I've heard it well.
[01:15:14.787 --> 01:15:16.608]  Checked it out several times since.
[01:15:16.648 --> 01:15:17.368]  Yeah, he did.
[01:15:17.448 --> 01:15:19.988]  He said, I'm guilty of extortion and bribery.
[01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:31.271]  And by the way, Article 2, Section 4 of the Constitution says the president or vice president may be impeached and if convicted, etc, etc, for three things.
[01:15:31.471 --> 01:15:32.512]  One of them is treason.
[01:15:32.532 --> 01:15:33.352]  That's not it.
[01:15:33.952 --> 01:15:43.018]  So I have seen stuff that is indicative of that when I reviewed the downloaded three laptops, not one that Hunter Biden had.
[01:15:43.699 --> 01:15:46.321]  Two, it's for bribery.
[01:15:47.861 --> 01:15:52.666]  And three for misdemeanors and felonies in office.
[01:15:52.706 --> 01:15:54.628]  They call the felonies high crimes.
[01:15:55.208 --> 01:16:11.143]  And since they set the precedent by going after President Trump for the second round of impeachment proceedings after he no longer was president, that's the precedent for going after a former vice president when he no longer holds office.
[01:16:11.163 --> 01:16:40.122]   So technically, He is in a situation where if any president in modern times actually, outside of say Richard Nixon perhaps, was in a position where he could be successfully prosecuted for this, it's him.
[01:16:41.964 --> 01:16:46.007]  I want to pick your brain because that's all fascinating and very important but we're going to break here in a few minutes.
[01:16:46.428 --> 01:17:00.421]  Your 35,000 foot view, the Trump indictments, the craziness, the left, just you're right, total cult, pedo cult, take control of the children cult, just in a minute and a half as we go to break, how would you describe this battle?
[01:17:00.501 --> 01:17:01.382]  Is humanity winning?
[01:17:01.442 --> 01:17:02.322]  Is the bad guys winning?
[01:17:02.342 --> 01:17:02.803]  What's happening?
[01:17:06.605 --> 01:17:17.590]  We are being shown that we have a common enemy, those who are against the traditional nuclear family, decency, morality, ethics, and good governance.
[01:17:17.730 --> 01:17:34.363]   So, black, white, brown, red, yellow, we can all come together to impose this new imposition of a modern secular religion that threatens The very thing that allowed them to arise in this country.
[01:17:34.463 --> 01:17:41.366]  So we have to protect our system at all costs and we need to turn everybody out of office who supports it.
[01:17:41.386 --> 01:17:46.868]  So what you're saying is we have a corporate, that's funny about corporations, weird sex cult.
[01:17:47.868 --> 01:17:49.749]  I think we're becoming aware of the danger.
[01:17:49.630 --> 01:17:52.029]  a religion for control that's been corporately rolled out.
[01:17:52.029 --> 01:17:57.088]   It's all MI6, CIA, mentally prepared and we're seeing a rejection of it. You're
[01:17:57.088 --> 01:18:01.260]   saying you believe that people are rejecting it or you think we're
[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:08.668]   starting to win or are we waking up? I think we're becoming aware of the danger. I
[01:18:08.668 --> 01:18:15.460]   think they went wrong with the transsexual involvement where people see
[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:22.230]   what is happening to women in sports equity.
[01:18:20.369 --> 01:18:22.489]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:18:22.449 --> 01:18:26.889]   whole thing where boys and girls one-on-one and be led to all of these
[01:18:26.889 --> 01:18:32.249]   generations from alley-oop up to present that's being thrown out of the window
[01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:39.328]   because some people selfishly hate themselves. Judge Joe Brown's our guest
[01:18:39.328 --> 01:18:43.488]   I'm your host Alex Jones and I've heard him accurately break down the different
[01:18:43.488 --> 01:18:49.128]   types of people but the whole LGBTQ PS now it's like a satanic movement I'm not
[01:18:50.047 --> 01:18:52.188]  They have the pedophile at the end of it.
[01:18:53.348 --> 01:19:01.591]  Why, they personally are into it, but if you look at the CIA, the Tabasco Institute, MI6 in the last 40 years, they've declassified.
[01:19:02.812 --> 01:19:12.656]  And the big corporations and the big, rich, billionaire, even Republican families that are pushing this admit it's about breaking down civilization.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:19.140]   society. So it's the elite, it's the establishment, look at all the TV shows,
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:25.080]   all the movies, everything, launching this assault. This is their new culture. Men as
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:30.000]   effeminates, women as the men, but all guided by the corporate state and there
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:37.879]   is a giant rejection of it, but it's so preposterous. We've got women in
[01:19:37.879 --> 01:19:42.600]  being overrun by men in their sports, all of it.
[01:19:40.408 --> 01:19:41.128]  I mean, look at this video.
[01:19:41.168 --> 01:19:42.549]  I'll play a clip just for you, Judge Joe Brown.
[01:19:43.249 --> 01:19:53.291]  Trans spokesperson for Ukraine says Ukraine will hunt down Russian propagandists around the world and they do have Ukrainian hit teams around the planet.
[01:19:53.331 --> 01:20:01.859]   So now they're threatening journalists around the planet with a man who says he's a woman Up there talking to you.
[01:20:01.879 --> 01:20:04.020]  So this is the psychology.
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:04.420]  Look at this.
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:05.560]  Drag queen.
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:06.740]  It's not a drag queen.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:11.421]  It's not Bob Hope joking around in a gag dressed like a woman.
[01:20:12.261 --> 01:20:13.522]  It's perverts.
[01:20:13.582 --> 01:20:14.202]  It's weirdos.
[01:20:14.262 --> 01:20:15.042]  It's crazy people.
[01:20:15.882 --> 01:20:18.643]  And they call a woman a guy in clown makeup.
[01:20:19.363 --> 01:20:21.723]  Drag queen whose group was honored by L.A.
[01:20:21.743 --> 01:20:25.324]  Dodgers arrested for masturbating in public for an hour.
[01:20:26.562 --> 01:20:29.867]  So why would the biggest corporations back this?
[01:20:30.067 --> 01:20:31.229]  Why would they push this?
[01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:33.652]  What's the endgame, Judge Joe Brown?
[01:20:35.334 --> 01:20:42.945]  Maybe what the problem is, is there are members of the corporate entities in question who are converts to the new religion.
[01:20:44.164 --> 01:20:54.388]  You see, that LGBTQ, that Q stands, according to their site, for two things, queer and questioning.
[01:20:54.988 --> 01:21:02.812]  And perhaps some people questioned to see what it was about, and now they can't back out because they don't want to come out of the closet.
[01:21:03.372 --> 01:21:07.794]  Now, it's their right to do what they want to do, get their freak on in the bedroom.
[01:21:08.934 --> 01:21:11.977]  That's being an American being in America.
[01:21:12.057 --> 01:21:17.361]  But we also have the right to oppose their propositions.
[01:21:17.541 --> 01:21:18.041]  Sure, sure.
[01:21:18.081 --> 01:21:19.322]  I mean, it's a form of rape.
[01:21:19.443 --> 01:21:21.664]  It's the tyranny of the minority.
[01:21:21.945 --> 01:21:23.346]  So they're blackmailing each other.
[01:21:23.406 --> 01:21:24.206]  It's a sex cult.
[01:21:24.727 --> 01:21:26.888]  And we know Rome had problems with sex cults.
[01:21:28.530 --> 01:21:30.231]  And I noticed something strange.
[01:21:31.092 --> 01:21:41.490]   Dana Cumberlander and I, with the real Dana, we do this ex space, Twitter space, formerly.
[01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:51.478]  And we were surprised at what we thought were trolls who are gay people who are violently opposed to LGBTQIA as a cult.
[01:21:51.578 --> 01:21:58.426]   As one of them put it, You can be Islamic, but not support Al-Qaeda or ISIS.
[01:21:58.466 --> 01:22:08.613]  You can be a Christian, but that doesn't mean you supported Reverend Jim Jones, no relation to you, and drinking Kool-Aid at church picnics in Guyana.
[01:22:09.554 --> 01:22:16.518]  So, in other words, don't conflate the two, because everybody doesn't buy into that.
[01:22:16.578 --> 01:22:20.081]  See, our system... That's right, and the corporate media speaks for all these groups.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:40.124]  Yeah, and see, the system we have is one where if you don't like something, oppose it with logic, rationality, reason, analysis, application, experimentation, so you can convince and establish a consensus.
[01:22:40.664 --> 01:22:49.966]  What we're running into is the fascist methodology of imposition of rules that prevent there being any dissent.
[01:22:51.092 --> 01:23:01.017]  Now, a lot of people call it communism, but it's not, because the communists always had the equivalent of a Politburo where these kind of things could be hashed out.
[01:23:01.037 --> 01:23:03.119]  This is a religious pedophile cult.
[01:23:04.159 --> 01:23:13.784]  Yeah, and it's also fascist, because fascism never had the equivalent of some kind of elected Politburo to hash the stuff out.
[01:23:15.563 --> 01:23:17.364]  Pure and simple fascism.
[01:23:18.084 --> 01:23:28.829]  Might be somewhat similar to some aspects of communism, but it's a religion, and if you want to see where we're going... It's a fascistic, nihilistic, pervert sex cult.
[01:23:30.327 --> 01:23:38.272]  And where we go with it is you go back to the Middle Ages and look what the Catholic Church did with the Crusades.
[01:23:38.432 --> 01:23:42.936]  Look at Islam sweeping out zealously to convert everybody.
[01:23:42.956 --> 01:23:45.297]  This is a pedophile sex cult crusade.
[01:23:46.238 --> 01:23:46.498]  Yeah.
[01:23:47.358 --> 01:23:56.074]   So we're doing this and people are conditioned by what has happened over the last 50 years
[01:23:56.074 --> 01:24:01.744]   where Hollywood, I've seen it, I was remarking on it when I was observing it, where is it
[01:24:01.744 --> 01:24:07.654]   going? And now I said, I think it's going here. And then later now I say, well, we're here now.
[01:24:07.654 --> 01:24:10.454]  Well, I mean, let's expand on that.
[01:24:10.454 --> 01:24:14.774]   If America is ashamed of its culture and taught to hate itself and have a misrepresentation
[01:24:14.774 --> 01:24:18.454]   be the culture, then there's a vacuum and the corporations have chosen this
[01:24:19.094 --> 01:24:22.295]  as a control arm because it's being pushed by them.
[01:24:22.333 --> 01:24:24.936]  Why do you think they've chosen this as the particular poison?
[01:24:27.278 --> 01:24:31.383]  Because some of them are practitioners.
[01:24:32.674 --> 01:24:37.116]  A lot of them sympathizers, a lot of them questioned and tried.
[01:24:37.676 --> 01:24:45.980]  And then they capture your children, and instead of standing up against it, you go under Stockholm Syndrome, and now you're validating your child by joining the cult.
[01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:46.520]  Okay.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:47.801]  Now, hold on.
[01:24:48.221 --> 01:24:49.241]  Here's what you're doing.
[01:24:49.661 --> 01:24:53.323]  You notice they take trannies to read to the children in school.
[01:24:53.903 --> 01:24:57.945]  Human children are most receptive to the female componentry.
[01:24:59.345 --> 01:25:01.126]  That's just human nature.
[01:25:01.286 --> 01:25:04.628]  Yeah, they're grooming children that ugly men in clown outfits are women.
[01:25:05.028 --> 01:25:08.290]  Okay, now, but wait, but it gets deeper than that.
[01:25:09.570 --> 01:25:21.816]  When mama has a child, child's in diapers, she takes the child on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, whatever the holy day is, to church, synagogue, temple, or mosque, okay?
[01:25:22.916 --> 01:25:25.758]  And the child endures for a few hours.
[01:25:27.259 --> 01:25:28.960]  And this goes on.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:30.101]  No, you're right.
[01:25:30.121 --> 01:25:33.583]  The new religious temple is the pet pedo drag queen time.
[01:25:34.703 --> 01:25:36.444]  Yeah, but here's the difference.
[01:25:36.765 --> 01:25:46.451]  Whereas the child becomes a good Christian, Muslim or Jew or follower of Buddhism or Hinduism or whatever it may be.
[01:25:47.451 --> 01:25:53.711]   One time a week, What you get with this is five days a week for six hours a day.
[01:25:53.831 --> 01:25:57.493]  You have this influence where this child is getting inculcated.
[01:25:57.553 --> 01:26:06.158]  So by the time they get to be eight or nine years old, this child has been conditioned, acculturated, and socialized.
[01:26:06.478 --> 01:26:07.598]  Now, think about it.
[01:26:07.778 --> 01:26:08.719]  They've been groomed!
[01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.365]  Yeah, but think about this.
[01:26:11.765 --> 01:26:25.234]  How many songs and things that you got in the first, second, and third, fourth grade do you remember now that you are fully mature and getting to be senior citizen and all that other stuff?
[01:26:25.694 --> 01:26:27.515]  See, it sticks with the kids.
[01:26:28.156 --> 01:26:42.502]   So they've been taught something that has Was fundamentally locked them into something because humans have their character and general personalities fully developed by the time they're eight years old.
[01:26:42.582 --> 01:26:43.182]  Let me stop.
[01:26:43.202 --> 01:26:44.082]  You're totally right.
[01:26:44.582 --> 01:26:45.283]  And so this is it.
[01:26:45.803 --> 01:26:48.624]  They aren't actually beautiful women or men that even look like women.
[01:26:48.964 --> 01:26:49.884]  They're scary.
[01:26:50.004 --> 01:26:53.766]  The clowns, the kids cry, but the mothers force them on them.
[01:26:53.826 --> 01:26:57.087]  So it's even trauma based and the children get scared.
[01:26:57.407 --> 01:27:00.308]  But this is their new identity and they're being scary on purpose.
[01:27:01.365 --> 01:27:08.490]  Yeah, see what's happened is it's the end thing to not be biased and prejudiced and be understanding of everybody.
[01:27:08.530 --> 01:27:10.631]  That came up with the Black Interaction.
[01:27:10.651 --> 01:27:14.114]  So you take your child to see a big fat man in a clown outfit who's probably a sex offender?
[01:27:15.146 --> 01:27:16.107]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:16.227 --> 01:27:18.049]  So you're being tolerant.
[01:27:18.249 --> 01:27:24.535]  See, we have 55 years since the civil rights era of you have to be tolerant.
[01:27:25.215 --> 01:27:35.364]  So they have expanded that and they have, through Hollywood and entertainment, started a mass campaign that is intensified of glorifying dysfunction.
[01:27:35.905 --> 01:27:38.606]   You don't promote The good guy.
[01:27:38.846 --> 01:27:47.733]  You don't promote the person who sacrifices for the good cause, except in action adventure movies, maybe.
[01:27:48.854 --> 01:27:56.680]  What you do is you push the pimp, the pervert, the drug dealer, the robber, the thief.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:02.985]  By the way, they even admitted high schools and colleges, they teach to quote trans people, you're going to be a sex worker.
[01:28:04.232 --> 01:28:05.312]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:28:05.772 --> 01:28:08.553]  See, and I recognize the game.
[01:28:08.653 --> 01:28:11.433]  I mean, I'm not gonna lie.
[01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:19.735]  40, 40 some years ago, I got a lot of the rent paid, the secretary's fees paid by representing pimps and hoes.
[01:28:19.855 --> 01:28:31.816]   And I know how that game works, where you bring something into the mainstream that used to be a little bit At Ox.
[01:28:31.916 --> 01:28:34.117]  But see, this is absurd.
[01:28:35.739 --> 01:28:40.762]  And frankly, I get mad because it destroyed my favorite sport.
[01:28:41.643 --> 01:28:42.504]  Girl watching.
[01:28:43.284 --> 01:28:50.350]  And I know some grown women that say they used to love to do boy watching, but you can't because you don't know what you're looking at.
[01:28:51.130 --> 01:28:53.572]  See, they're doing something very bad.
[01:28:55.133 --> 01:28:58.012]   That they're This is one thing.
[01:28:58.372 --> 01:29:08.582]  Probably the hardest thing a normal adult has in their entire lives is consistently being able to deal with and accommodate the opposite sex.
[01:29:09.943 --> 01:29:10.704]  You know what I mean?
[01:29:11.384 --> 01:29:17.490]  So what happens is they tell these kids, you don't have to do that.
[01:29:17.570 --> 01:29:19.252]  You can take the easy way.
[01:29:19.412 --> 01:29:21.153]  You can deal with same sex.
[01:29:21.213 --> 01:29:27.084]   So you knock out Yeah, they're fundamentally screwing up the human system.
[01:29:27.144 --> 01:29:28.445]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:28.545 --> 01:29:44.793]  So you're throwing out Boys and Girls 101 A and B. Next thing is you get away from the thing being reproductively based into something else that is basically mutually assisted masturbation.
[01:29:45.570 --> 01:29:54.417]  It's way beyond, remember Jocelyn Elders said, when she was the nominee for Surgeon General, that schools need to masturbate children as young as two.
[01:29:55.198 --> 01:30:02.823]  And that's the state wanting a sexual relationship with your child to guide their development and form a cult sex relationship with your child.
[01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:08.268]  It's very simple, they're going right in with sex, with children, and connecting it to their globalist agenda.
[01:30:10.669 --> 01:30:11.090]  Okay, now.
[01:30:11.937 --> 01:30:12.878]  Here's the other thing.
[01:30:12.958 --> 01:30:20.802]  See, what they're doing is forgetting logic, rationality, reason, and then being hypocritically inconsistent.
[01:30:20.902 --> 01:30:29.203]   The child is supposed to be someone Who, because of their age, can't be held accountable for murdering somebody because they don't know any better.
[01:30:29.343 --> 01:30:31.665]  They can't be held accountable for this.
[01:30:31.725 --> 01:30:34.586]  They have to be indulged because they're so delicate.
[01:30:35.087 --> 01:30:38.969]  They can't sign contracts or enter into binding agreements.
[01:30:39.029 --> 01:30:43.191]  They can't vote, can't buy tobacco, can't buy whiskey, alright?
[01:30:43.251 --> 01:30:48.775]  But they can be confused by their elementary school teacher that they're another sex.
[01:30:49.924 --> 01:31:10.316]  No, but at 7, 8, 9, 10, they're supposed to be able to make a choice to take themselves to the veterinarian and get spayed or fixed or neutered or castrated and turned into eunuchs, even though they are supposed to be unable to have all of these other responsibilities.
[01:31:10.336 --> 01:31:15.419]  That's right, they can't join the military and buy a pack of cigarettes or a bottle of whiskey, but they can be sterilized.
[01:31:16.297 --> 01:31:17.697]  They can cut the balls off.
[01:31:18.418 --> 01:31:21.199]  So that is a preposterous thing.
[01:31:21.599 --> 01:31:27.040]  And the only way they're going to do this kind of recruitment is to get to these children.
[01:31:27.621 --> 01:31:30.121]  And they do another thing that is very bad.
[01:31:30.782 --> 01:31:41.650]   The women you're looking at are not women, they're fakes, but they're faking the worst Worse aspects of womanhood.
[01:31:42.151 --> 01:31:47.475]  They either look like an old, ugly harlot of the type that used to run a New York brothel.
[01:31:48.075 --> 01:31:50.697]  They look like strippers and whores.
[01:31:52.118 --> 01:31:55.240]  They don't look like normal, respectable women.
[01:31:55.381 --> 01:31:57.882]  So they're getting two things put in their head.
[01:31:57.902 --> 01:32:03.285]   One, This woman is telling you and you're more responsive up
[01:32:03.285 --> 01:32:07.775]   until eight years old to the woman telling you something rather than a man
[01:32:07.775 --> 01:32:12.815]   next thing you're simultaneously getting a negative
[01:32:12.815 --> 01:32:18.735]   image of womanhood So they are I say exactly exactly they're stealing
[01:32:18.673 --> 01:32:23.673]   stealing women's identities and then creating a false image of what a woman is.
[01:32:23.673 --> 01:32:27.512]   And now all over the country I see these reports where they're hiring convicted pedophiles
[01:32:27.512 --> 01:32:29.394]  to be principals and they're getting caught.
[01:32:29.394 --> 01:32:31.073]  I mean this is a real cult.
[01:32:31.073 --> 01:32:35.033]   How many people do you think they've infiltrated with this cult?
[01:32:35.033 --> 01:32:36.033]  A whole bunch.
[01:32:36.033 --> 01:32:41.434]   See, one of the problems I had to deal with on the bench as a criminal court judge, I
[01:32:41.434 --> 01:32:43.712]  got elected to two eight-year terms.
[01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:51.462]  One of the worst types of criminal offense is what practicing pedophiles did to children.
[01:32:51.562 --> 01:32:52.804]  It's absolutely horrible.
[01:32:53.384 --> 01:32:59.866]  You corrupt a child for life, you corrupt the people that they influence, and it's a vampire thing.
[01:33:00.046 --> 01:33:05.328]  A vampire bites somebody, they turn into a vampire, they bite somebody, and it increases.
[01:33:05.828 --> 01:33:21.724]   The problem is, is that we used to... I'd have them analyze before sentencing, and they'd hook them up, and they'd put Transducers on their penises and they'd show them stuff and see what they got an erection on.
[01:33:22.184 --> 01:33:25.747]  They'd look at ordinary normal sex, nothing's going on.
[01:33:25.947 --> 01:33:35.474]  They'd start looking at children having simulated sex and they'd get rock hard erections because that's just the way they're hardwired.
[01:33:36.094 --> 01:33:44.698]  Now, we're supposed to say that because somebody has a proclivity to do something, it should be allowed because anything goes.
[01:33:44.898 --> 01:33:45.178]  No.
[01:33:45.618 --> 01:33:51.120]  Oh, the head of the Young Turks said he wants to legalize sex with animals and wants to pleasure pigs and donkeys.
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:51.300]  Yeah.
[01:33:52.101 --> 01:33:54.742]  Well, let's extend it a little further.
[01:33:54.882 --> 01:33:58.963]  Let's take another popular category of sex offender.
[01:33:59.023 --> 01:34:10.310]   The rapes, for the most part, a lot of them have a psychological drive that It is very motivating and compelling, let's say.
[01:34:10.370 --> 01:34:12.532]  But are you going to let them go around and rape?
[01:34:12.652 --> 01:34:12.932]  No.
[01:34:13.092 --> 01:34:17.436]  You say, I don't care whether you want to feel compelled to, you can't.
[01:34:17.616 --> 01:34:21.419]  And if you do, you will be punished and put away for the safety of society.
[01:34:21.459 --> 01:34:23.100]  And that's why having pedophiles work for the system.
[01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:31.047]  We learned the CIA in Afghanistan put thousands of pedophiles in charge of all the little towns on purpose because they said, as long as we give them kids, they'll do whatever we say.
[01:34:31.507 --> 01:34:33.269]  So they're the perfect cult robot.
[01:34:34.491 --> 01:34:37.453]  Yeah, and then the other thing too, Ukraine again.
[01:34:38.154 --> 01:34:44.478]  If you read what Putin and company are putting out, it's not what we're being told this whole thing is about.
[01:34:44.538 --> 01:34:48.581]  They have three things that they say they're dealing with in the Ukraine.
[01:34:49.903 --> 01:35:01.757]  To prevent the resurgence of Nazism because nothing got done after World War II with the Nuremberg Trials with Ukraine that supplied a lot of Nazi converts.
[01:35:02.118 --> 01:35:05.963]  Yeah, we always hear the Nazis hid in Argentina, but most of them hid in Ukraine.
[01:35:07.096 --> 01:35:15.725]  Yeah, well, nothing ever got done in Ukraine because Stalin said, they're now back into the Soviet Union, we'll take care of it, but nothing had happened.
[01:35:15.765 --> 01:35:19.669]  So Putin's putting it out that he's dealing with resurgent Nazism.
[01:35:20.329 --> 01:35:30.659]  Next thing he says he's doing, which brings us to this, is he's fighting this attempt by America to impose this rainbow cult.
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:32.841]  On the rest of the world.
[01:35:33.342 --> 01:35:44.830]  And third thing, he says he's attempting to redeem Ukraine from the sex slavery that they have so heavily gotten involved in.
[01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:57.739]   You see, so that's three bad things that we don't hear about and we push two of them And by the way, I'm not defending, I'm not even defending Putin, but everything he says is true.
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:08.946]  Ukraine is just rampant Nazis, that's what it was at World War II, rampant sex trade, and then they're trying to make Russia do the same pedophile stuff, and the Russians aren't buying it.
[01:36:08.966 --> 01:36:11.047]  They recognize an outside cult.
[01:36:12.448 --> 01:36:19.419]   Yeah, and interestingly enough, Russia has had a man-up program for the last five years.
[01:36:19.539 --> 01:36:25.085]  The People's Republic of China, two years ago in January, came up with an official man-up program.
[01:36:25.166 --> 01:36:25.886]  That's what they're copying.
[01:36:26.006 --> 01:36:28.709]  So the Russians are, we're manning up, the Chinese are manning up.
[01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:32.694]  In fact, all this LGBTQ stuff is outlawed in those countries, basically.
[01:36:32.974 --> 01:36:33.655]  Especially China.
[01:36:33.795 --> 01:36:34.496]  And what are we doing?
[01:36:35.156 --> 01:36:35.497]  Pushing it.
[01:36:37.045 --> 01:36:41.789]  Yeah, so see, this is our collateral damage to our system.
[01:36:42.329 --> 01:36:47.573]  They have a right to advocate doing it, but we have a right to oppose it.
[01:36:48.033 --> 01:36:52.257]  So what they're trying to do is strip our right to oppose it.
[01:36:53.097 --> 01:37:15.458]   So they use the system For purposes that our way of doing things would not allow them to get, because they could not convince the public that it's just a way to go, to give up Boys and Girls 101A and B, and give up Girl Watching and Boy Watching.
[01:37:15.478 --> 01:37:18.341]  Alright, Judge, the time goes by so fast, we're almost out of time.
[01:37:18.741 --> 01:37:25.306]  Finish up on this and solutions to fight it, and then the Trump indictments as a judge, where you see the elections, other key things you want to add.
[01:37:27.546 --> 01:37:41.264]  Okay, number one, I'm running for mayor in Memphis to bring sanity back to the place because every one of my opponents is staunchly into gun control stuff where we have probably the highest murder rate in America.
[01:37:42.726 --> 01:37:49.530]  That's an unfortunate thing, but what they want to do is disarm folk and think that somehow or another that's going to stop the criminality.
[01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:54.113]  And I know from 50 years of dealing with it, the crooks ain't following the law anyway.
[01:37:54.173 --> 01:37:59.376]  And everything you need to stop criminality is already on the books if you enforce it.
[01:37:59.836 --> 01:38:02.235]  or you'd be serious about it.
[01:38:02.235 --> 01:38:08.115]   And the next thing that comes out of that is we've got to stop this kind of stuff where
[01:38:08.115 --> 01:38:14.556]   everybody just says it's all right to ruin the children, it's all right to not just tolerate
[01:38:14.556 --> 01:38:17.476]  people doing it, but to jump on board.
[01:38:17.476 --> 01:38:22.796]   It's all right to steal, it's all right to be unethical, it's all right to emasculate
[01:38:22.796 --> 01:38:24.396]  your society.
[01:38:24.396 --> 01:38:28.875]   It's all right for the privileged corporate entities to rip the public off.
[01:38:28.875 --> 01:38:35.396]   And in Memphis, getting billions of dollars that the taxpayers put into trough and just
[01:38:35.396 --> 01:38:38.716]  limited the outcome and the benefit to a very few.
[01:38:38.716 --> 01:38:40.076]  So I'm running for mayor.
[01:38:40.076 --> 01:38:40.515]  I've got...
[01:38:40.515 --> 01:38:50.515]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:46.723]  You just can't let this happen because this is not what I've been about for my whole life.
[01:38:46.843 --> 01:38:57.750]  So I'm out there and I put my hat in the ring and our early voting starts tomorrow, Friday, and runs through the 30th and the general elections, October 5th.
[01:38:58.430 --> 01:39:02.573]  And back on the Trump thing, what is he saying?
[01:39:02.653 --> 01:39:03.614]  What are you saying?
[01:39:03.694 --> 01:39:04.614]  What have I said?
[01:39:04.895 --> 01:39:06.916]  We have a problem with fixed elections.
[01:39:07.516 --> 01:39:26.654]  Well, in January 2021, when the Justice Department said that there were no election improprieties in the country of any significance, two days later, they issued their quarterly report on Memphis, Shelby County, and said once again, there was not a fair election because the voting machines are horribly corrupt.
[01:39:26.734 --> 01:39:38.859]   And oh, by the way, we put the money up 13 years ago to replace all these machines that the local yokels have not done, so they have been having another corrupt election.
[01:39:39.688 --> 01:39:43.170]  So now we have new voting machines, so let's see what happens.
[01:39:43.230 --> 01:39:49.835]  So all of these things go into the mix, and Orwell said this in 1984, double speak.
[01:39:49.875 --> 01:39:51.416]  Say one thing, mean another.
[01:39:51.496 --> 01:39:56.499]  And we have to be vigilant to pay attention to these types of propaganda.
[01:39:56.779 --> 01:40:09.500]   And there are better things than sitting down watching ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, CNN, etc, etc, etc.
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:12.059]  There are other ways of finding information.
[01:40:12.230 --> 01:40:15.793]  So let's take those means and pay attention to what's going on.
[01:40:15.833 --> 01:40:16.273]  I totally agree.
[01:40:16.293 --> 01:40:19.036]  We're out of time, but gut level, I think the tide's turning.
[01:40:19.096 --> 01:40:21.297]  I think we're winning if we can just hold on.
[01:40:21.317 --> 01:40:23.359]  Do you agree humanity's starting to win or where are we?
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:28.001]  I see a backlash about to happen.
[01:40:28.461 --> 01:40:29.942]  A bad backlash.
[01:40:30.522 --> 01:40:38.465]  We are not only going to push back, we're going to smack something down.
[01:40:39.205 --> 01:40:47.288]  When this governor said she's outlawing the Second Amendment and the First Amendment, what did the people do in Albuquerque?
[01:40:48.128 --> 01:40:55.953]   They showed up armed, there were thousands of them, and the police were going, Not us.
[01:40:56.113 --> 01:41:01.894]  Now, maybe they'll come back and identify people in the video clips and indict them, but... Well, that's the thing.
[01:41:01.914 --> 01:41:04.915]  If we were doing a real insurrection on January 6th, we'd be running things.
[01:41:05.235 --> 01:41:06.515]  We're not fascists, exactly.
[01:41:06.775 --> 01:41:08.916]  And you saw the sheriffs go, whoa, we're about to have a war.
[01:41:08.956 --> 01:41:09.276]  Stop.
[01:41:10.596 --> 01:41:10.936]  I agree.
[01:41:10.956 --> 01:41:12.396]  The left is pushing too far.
[01:41:13.556 --> 01:41:17.657]  Yeah, and it's like human nature is human nature, and you can't get away from it.
[01:41:17.857 --> 01:41:19.218]  So, here you go.
[01:41:19.358 --> 01:41:21.118]  People said, we're not having it.
[01:41:22.162 --> 01:41:23.424]  Don't tread on us.
[01:41:23.965 --> 01:41:25.587]  So come do something about it.
[01:41:25.647 --> 01:41:27.690]  You see, power to the people.
[01:41:30.985 --> 01:41:41.868]  She's way out of line, and in fact, she broke several federal laws by doing what she did, and if she does one thing to try to implement it, they're felonies, she ought to be prosecuted.
[01:41:42.568 --> 01:41:43.208]  And the U.S.
[01:41:43.248 --> 01:41:46.209]  Attorney in the area ought to indict her, get her indicted.
[01:41:46.929 --> 01:41:47.469]  Absolutely.
[01:41:47.489 --> 01:41:48.309]  We love you, brother.
[01:41:48.329 --> 01:41:50.050]  Thank you so much for being on.
[01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:51.490]  Everybody needs to support you.

[01:42:20.582 --> 01:42:21.983]  A lot of smart people, man.
[01:42:22.003 --> 01:42:23.565]  We need him in government big time.
[01:42:24.085 --> 01:42:25.126]  Think he doesn't have stuff to do?
[01:42:25.166 --> 01:42:26.487]  He's doing it because he cares about the people.
[01:42:26.967 --> 01:42:29.269]  All right, Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, coming up.
[01:42:29.289 --> 01:42:30.529]  We'll talk about everything straight ahead.

[01:44:10.533 --> 01:44:18.215]   at JonesCrowder.com Steve Favis is an expert in computer science and advanced
[01:44:18.215 --> 01:44:19.364]  robotics.
[01:44:19.996 --> 01:44:29.428]  He has been researching the Maui fires and has compiled evidence that the technology exists to have started these fires from a satellite in Earth orbit.
[01:44:30.069 --> 01:44:37.195]  He has also confirmed that the CCP had satellites capable of doing so above Maui at the time of the fires.
[01:44:37.855 --> 01:44:45.661]  His work has been published on his website, stevefavis.com, and includes everything you need to recreate these findings.
[01:44:46.782 --> 01:44:57.655]  The most efficient way to ignite a fire on the surface from a satellite in Earth orbit would be to paint the target in segments by pulsing the laser with an advanced targeting system.
[01:44:58.295 --> 01:45:05.423]  To see if this were possible, FAVAS calculated what it would require to create a meter-wide, mile-long fire.
[01:45:06.244 --> 01:45:11.867]  Fired from a satellite, the Earth's atmosphere will absorb and scatter some of the laser energy.
[01:45:12.368 --> 01:45:16.670]  And so the laser would need to be in a wavelength range that minimizes this.
[01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:24.174]  The most effective wavelength would be in the near-infrared range, which would allow better transmission through the atmosphere.
[01:45:24.855 --> 01:45:34.740]  The near-infrared range would be invisible to the naked eye, and would also have a minimal reaction with objects colored blue on the Earth's surface.
[01:45:36.261 --> 01:45:46.963]  The power of the laser would need to be in the hundreds of kilowatts range, and so Favas based his calculations on a 10 megawatt laser firing from Earth orbit.
[01:45:47.623 --> 01:46:00.886]  Assuming that the atmospheric loss amounts to 50% of the overall power, and only 5 megawatts reaches the surface as a 1 square meter beam, it would ignite a fire almost instantly.
[01:46:01.966 --> 01:46:14.639]  If this 5 megawatt beam was pulsed across a 1 meter by 1 mile long area in segments, then the time to ignite the entire area would be roughly 2.7 minutes.
[01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:21.446]  And it would only take approximately 8.8 seconds to melt an aluminum alloy wheel.
[01:46:22.226 --> 01:46:33.706]   The amount of energy required to pulse a 10 megawatt laser for 2.7 minutes would require approximately 3,220 capacitors,
[01:46:33.706 --> 01:46:39.105]  which would amount to about 32,200 kilograms in weight.
[01:46:39.105 --> 01:46:44.586]   Using Met Lab software and plugging in public data provided from NORAD,
[01:46:44.586 --> 01:46:54.027]   he found that satellites launched and monitored by the CCP were directly above the Maui fires at the time of ignition.
[01:46:54.085 --> 01:47:07.251]  The CCP's most powerful rocket, the March 5, can launch up to 48,500 kilograms of payload, which is more than enough to carry the required payload in Favus' calculations.
[01:47:07.871 --> 01:47:13.797]  But Favis has found that the CCP has much more powerful lasers deployed already.
[01:47:14.418 --> 01:47:21.064]  He has calculated that the CCP has up to 70 gigawatt lasers in Earth orbit right now.
[01:47:21.725 --> 01:47:27.450]  That's at least a hundred times more powerful than what he factored into these calculations.
[01:47:28.511 --> 01:47:38.078]  Adjusting NORAD's Default Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC, to the local time zones, FAVAS found the following.
[01:47:38.818 --> 01:47:43.581]  The Olinda Fire was ignited at approximately 10.47 p.m.
[01:47:44.022 --> 01:47:44.962]  on August 7th.
[01:47:45.603 --> 01:47:54.369]  At this exact time, CCP satellite labeled NORAD-53299 was directly over the location.
[01:47:55.649 --> 01:48:00.393]  The Lahaina Fire was ignited at approximately 6.37 a.m.
[01:48:00.713 --> 01:48:01.534]  on August 8th.
[01:48:02.134 --> 01:48:07.779]  At this exact time, CCP satellite labeled NORAD 55836 was directly over the location.
[01:48:11.541 --> 01:48:16.005]  The Kula fire was ignited at approximately 1130 a.m.
[01:48:16.465 --> 01:48:17.326]  on August 8th.
[01:48:18.026 --> 01:48:23.431]  At this exact time, CCP satellite labeled NORAD-53299 was directly over the location.
[01:48:27.153 --> 01:48:35.137]  The so-called Deep State does not want you to know that deadly lasers of mass destruction are freely traveling above us.
[01:48:35.817 --> 01:48:48.323]  And you can check this all for yourself at stevefavis.com, where he provides the source code and has developed a specific software program that you can download and check for these satellites yourself.
[01:48:49.144 --> 01:48:52.144]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:48:52.144 --> 01:49:05.144]  [Music]
[01:49:05.144 --> 01:49:10.144]  Well, we've got a jam-packed hour number three today.
[01:49:10.144 --> 01:49:11.144]  [Whistles]
[01:49:11.557 --> 01:49:13.539]  We already got a loaded plate, big time.
[01:49:13.939 --> 01:49:14.720]  Like, two loaded.
[01:49:16.502 --> 01:49:19.965]  All the crazy stuff going on with constitutional lawyer and great historian Robert Barnes.
[01:49:20.386 --> 01:49:21.827]  But just minutes ago it broke.
[01:49:23.028 --> 01:49:27.012]  Hunter Biden indicted on federal gun charges, NBC News.
[01:49:28.044 --> 01:49:31.466]  And I just popped in during that one-minute break and I said, hey Barnes, what's going on?
[01:49:31.486 --> 01:49:32.287]  He goes, it's a cover-up.
[01:49:32.607 --> 01:49:34.508]  I knew that, but he's a lawyer.
[01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:35.769]  We all know that.
[01:49:35.889 --> 01:49:37.710]  He'll be able to break down what this really means.
[01:49:37.730 --> 01:49:42.354]  But they also need cover for all the political actions against Trump to say, oh look, we're being fair.
[01:49:44.935 --> 01:49:53.221]  We've gone after Conor Biden, but we also have Politico, CNN, all today attacking Biden.
[01:49:55.655 --> 01:50:00.680]  That's why I said days ago, they're about to get ready to indict Hunter because they're wanting him to step down.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.221]  They're trying to force him out.
[01:50:03.022 --> 01:50:06.426]  He's been a puppet so far, but he's actually holding on.
[01:50:07.186 --> 01:50:07.987]  Holding on.
[01:50:08.127 --> 01:50:11.851]  So, Robert Barnes, VivaBarnesLaw.Locals.com.
[01:50:11.871 --> 01:50:14.413]  Find all his great podcasts and popular shows.
[01:50:14.954 --> 01:50:16.836]  Barnes, there is so much to cover in this hour.
[01:50:18.522 --> 01:50:18.822]  U.S.
[01:50:18.862 --> 01:50:20.963]  cruise missiles raining down on Russian fleets.
[01:50:21.983 --> 01:50:23.744]  A year ago, the Pentagon said we can't do that.
[01:50:23.764 --> 01:50:24.544]  It's World War III.
[01:50:24.744 --> 01:50:26.424]  Abrams tanks, F-16s.
[01:50:26.965 --> 01:50:28.085]  All these Trump indictments.
[01:50:29.225 --> 01:50:33.566]  What's happened with the election, the Hunter Biden situation.
[01:50:34.207 --> 01:50:40.849]  Matt Gaetz saying, hey, we're moving ahead to go ahead and unseat McCarthy, who did promise he'd do all this stuff, like impeachment and the rest of it.
[01:50:41.369 --> 01:50:41.969]  Hadn't done it.
[01:50:43.106 --> 01:50:49.071]  So all hell is breaking loose, but I think it's fair to say the tide has turned, but I don't want to be too optimistic.
[01:50:49.531 --> 01:50:51.433]  The bad guys have some tricks up their sleeves.
[01:50:51.453 --> 01:51:01.040]  So let's talk about, and you'll have the floor here, go wherever you want first, but in general, in the general 35,000 foot view, where is America?
[01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:02.041]  Where is the world right now?
[01:51:02.101 --> 01:51:06.825]  How would you describe the climate politically, culturally, economically?
[01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:09.932]  Well, I think we're in a very precarious place.
[01:51:09.972 --> 01:51:17.883]  I mean, economically, we're looking at the likelihood of a major recession within the next 6 to 12 months, a major housing decline, a major equity market decline.
[01:51:18.604 --> 01:51:22.929]  We see that in a wide range of economic data that has been highly predictive in the past.
[01:51:23.670 --> 01:51:28.436]  We see China is in a major problem with its internal real estate issue, which might blow up its economy.
[01:51:28.856 --> 01:51:30.578]  What might that mean for China?
[01:51:30.618 --> 01:51:32.039]  Might China go into Taiwan?
[01:51:32.079 --> 01:51:42.411]  Might they want to escalate martial or military conflict themselves as a way to escape their own internal economic problems from their own real estate bubble created by a managed economy?
[01:51:42.891 --> 01:51:59.676]  And then you have what I consider the most precarious threat to America, which is this weaponized lawfare in the attempt of the granddaughter and great-niece of one of the most radical foreign communists in global history, who's the federal judge presiding over the Donald Trump case.
[01:52:00.056 --> 01:52:02.296]  Trump team moved to disqualifier this week.
[01:52:02.356 --> 01:52:07.618]  I think they should have moved earlier, but at least they moved finally to disqualifier based on their prejudice and prior statements.
[01:52:08.518 --> 01:52:21.804]  You have the overt, open criminalization and punishment for the first time in American history, that I know of, saying that someone's speech and press activities is grounds for an incarceral punishment, which is the case of Owen Schroer.
[01:52:22.444 --> 01:52:25.065]  You have the cover-up that's being taken place with Hunter Biden.
[01:52:25.244 --> 01:52:30.684]   what appears to be meaningful efforts to punish and prosecute are actually techniques and
[01:52:30.684 --> 01:52:36.484]   tools designed to prevent Hunter Biden from being subpoenaed by Congress in the impeachment
[01:52:36.484 --> 01:52:37.484]  inquiry.
[01:52:37.484 --> 01:52:38.484]  Exactly.
[01:52:38.484 --> 01:52:40.844]   You create a fake indictment to suck up all the other investigations.
[01:52:40.844 --> 01:52:41.845]  Correct.
[01:52:41.845 --> 01:52:43.564]  And you give him Fifth Amendment rights.
[01:52:43.564 --> 01:52:47.123]   Remember, I mean, the deal they've already cut with him, which I believe his team can
[01:52:47.123 --> 01:52:53.123]   enforce any time they legally want, is that he was granted full immunity for pretty much
[01:52:53.123 --> 01:52:57.885]   everything and the government already signed that, which makes it a binding contract.
[01:52:57.885 --> 01:52:59.125]  So what is all this stuff about?
[01:52:59.125 --> 01:53:02.244]   Well, we're going to indict him on these things that we're going to pretend that's no longer
[01:53:02.244 --> 01:53:03.625]  enforceable.
[01:53:03.625 --> 01:53:06.204]  It's very simple because he was given complete immunity.
[01:53:06.204 --> 01:53:09.885]   He no longer had a right to assert the Fifth Amendment if Congress subpoenaed him in an
[01:53:09.885 --> 01:53:11.444]  impeachment inquiry.
[01:53:11.444 --> 01:53:16.664]   So they need to dodge Hunter Biden being able to be forced to testify in the impeachment
[01:53:16.664 --> 01:53:21.463]   inquiry that could unravel the entire Biden family corruption scheme that he and his sister
[01:53:21.463 --> 01:53:26.444]   seem to have been wanting to expose in their own way about their father by leaving laptops
[01:53:26.444 --> 01:53:31.164]   behind, by leaving diaries behind that expose their father for the last better part of a
[01:53:31.164 --> 01:53:31.164]  decade.
[01:53:31.164 --> 01:53:33.564]  decade.
[01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:33.201]  So how do you prevent that?
[01:53:33.241 --> 01:53:34.823]  You say, oh, he has Fifth Amendment rights.
[01:53:34.863 --> 01:53:35.824]  Well, he doesn't.
[01:53:35.904 --> 01:53:38.366]  He does not have those rights with that immunity deal.
[01:53:38.707 --> 01:53:39.247]  So what do you do?
[01:53:39.267 --> 01:53:40.789]  You pretend there isn't an immunity deal.
[01:53:41.169 --> 01:53:43.531]  You bring an indictment on gun charges.
[01:53:43.812 --> 01:53:45.253]  You let those charges linger.
[01:53:45.593 --> 01:53:47.675]  You don't rush those charges to trial.
[01:53:48.096 --> 01:53:53.541]  And you drag them out long enough so that he can't be forced to testify in any impeachment inquiry.
[01:53:53.681 --> 01:53:56.103]  And that's kind of like Sam Beckman Freed.
[01:53:56.724 --> 01:54:03.392]  Where he has a whole bunch of charges but all the campaign finances dropped because he was a money launderer for the DNC, then later they'll drop the others.
[01:54:04.898 --> 01:54:06.259]  Yeah, I mean, it's multiple guises.
[01:54:06.279 --> 01:54:20.752]  I mean, they got Sam Bateman free to agree to withdraw his challenge to extradition on grounds they wouldn't indict him on the various campaign finance charges, even though the government knew they were going to succeed in that extradition of him.
[01:54:21.072 --> 01:54:31.742]  So the extradition was just a pretext, a procedural pretext, whereby the government could be forced not to prosecute any charges that could implicate the Democratic Party directly.
[01:54:32.382 --> 01:54:33.363]  And it's the same pattern.
[01:54:33.383 --> 01:54:44.968]  I mean, Senator Vance was voicing yesterday, the SEC, which is involved in the FTX case, also involved in going after various crypto, you know, Ripple and others, has been politically weaponized.
[01:54:45.208 --> 01:54:55.954]   As Senator Vance said in the hearings yesterday, what's taking place, as was seen in the attempts to attack truth and the efforts to create investment in Trump's new social media alternative, What happened?
[01:54:55.974 --> 01:54:58.276]  The SEC went after everybody connected to it.
[01:54:58.697 --> 01:55:04.262]  So we have the overt, political, partisan weaponization of every single part of our legal system.
[01:55:05.324 --> 01:55:10.469]  And the greatest, most imminent threat are the charges against Trump and the DC case against Trump.
[01:55:11.202 --> 01:55:16.364]  What happens if they literally lock him up and various corrupt actors try to keep him off the ballot?
[01:55:16.544 --> 01:55:22.225]  There's no constitutional basis to do so, but that doesn't mean rogue judges and rogue officials won't try to.
[01:55:22.725 --> 01:55:25.746]  What happens if he's in prison while he's waiting for trial?
[01:55:25.826 --> 01:55:28.687]  While he's waiting for the election day and can't campaign?
[01:55:29.147 --> 01:55:30.347]  Which is what they're trying to do.
[01:55:30.487 --> 01:55:32.348]  We've never seen this before in American history.
[01:55:32.788 --> 01:55:41.914]  This is the most overt, open, political, partisan weaponization of the legal process on the criminal side that we've seen since the civil version against Infowars and you.
[01:55:42.374 --> 01:55:44.215]  And we saw what the system tried to do there.
[01:55:44.255 --> 01:55:45.716]  They're trying to replicate it here.
[01:55:46.137 --> 01:55:58.164]  It would mean the end of the rule of law in America, the end of open, fair, free, and transparent elections in America, and it is the greatest deep state threat to democracy and to peace around the world and to prosperity at home.
[01:55:58.424 --> 01:55:59.245]  Let me ask you this.
[01:56:02.230 --> 01:56:06.111]  Big picture, we use the football analogy, it's halftime right now, who's winning?
[01:56:06.511 --> 01:56:08.512]  And then what do you expect the deep state to do next?
[01:56:10.052 --> 01:56:18.495]  Well the American people are winning and Trump is winning and the populist revolution is winning and that's why they're resorting to more dirty and desperate tactics and techniques.
[01:56:19.475 --> 01:56:25.457]  And that's what makes it so terrifying from a perspective of anybody who loves America and believes in freedom and prosperity and liberty.
[01:56:26.388 --> 01:56:27.268]  We have to defeat this.
[01:56:27.968 --> 01:56:31.089]  And the key is because they can't win in an honest election.
[01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:32.570]  In an honest election, Trump wins.
[01:56:32.590 --> 01:56:33.950]  In an honest election, he won in 2020.
[01:56:34.110 --> 01:56:35.510]  In an honest election, he won in 2016.
[01:56:35.550 --> 01:56:38.911]  So in an honest election, they know that Biden loses.
[01:56:39.331 --> 01:56:45.173]  The problem they have, as you mentioned, a lot of people want Biden out in the Democratic Party establishment, but they don't have a backup.
[01:56:45.653 --> 01:56:46.974]  Newsom is more unpopular.
[01:56:47.034 --> 01:56:48.674]  Kamala Harris is more unpopular.
[01:56:49.736 --> 01:56:51.280]  Hillary Clinton is more unpopular.
[01:56:51.340 --> 01:56:52.323]  They don't have a popular alternative.
[01:56:52.343 --> 01:56:54.047]  So they've painted themselves into a corner.
[01:56:54.087 --> 01:56:56.332]  What are you expected to do if you play out all the pieces?
[01:56:57.979 --> 01:57:05.685]  I think the deep state apparatus will ultimately stick with Biden, try to keep his corpse alive to survive through impeachment, survive through the election.
[01:57:06.266 --> 01:57:10.008]  They right now really believe that just a conviction would sink Trump.
[01:57:10.429 --> 01:57:10.729]  It won't.
[01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:14.452]  Any conviction in a show trial, in a circus in D.C.
[01:57:14.792 --> 01:57:21.037]  presided over by the scion of foreign communists is not going to convince anybody in America not to back Trump.
[01:57:21.477 --> 01:57:25.300]  Trump's platform is real simple, you know, peace abroad, prosperity at home.
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:27.822]  Joe Biden, war abroad, poverty at home.
[01:57:28.002 --> 01:57:31.105]  And now Trump's added, stick it to the system, I'm hardcore.
[01:57:31.145 --> 01:57:33.106]  So let's use Owen as a microcosm.
[01:57:33.787 --> 01:57:42.033]  Again, I'm not a super genius or a rocket scientist like Elon Musk, but I do know that that would make Owen 50 times bigger, what they just did.
[01:57:42.353 --> 01:57:47.217]  Now he's everywhere, every show wants him on, everybody's calling me, he's doing 20 interviews a day.
[01:57:48.633 --> 01:58:00.047]  Well, don't they know messing with a clean-cut, nice guy with no criminal record, and putting him in jail for trying to stop a riot, it just discredits them, but they only think one level, like, I'm gonna crush you.
[01:58:00.747 --> 01:58:03.571]  It's, it's, it's, it's, something's wrong with these people.
[01:58:04.741 --> 01:58:08.743]  Well yeah, you know, we're both a fan of certain films that capture this.
[01:58:08.783 --> 01:58:16.228]  Think of like, when tyranny is at its later stage, it's more a dumber down, idiocracy stage, it's deeper, desperate stage.
[01:58:16.668 --> 01:58:17.628]  That's when it gets dumb.
[01:58:17.969 --> 01:58:18.909]  And that's what we're seeing.
[01:58:19.029 --> 01:58:22.411]  Now the scary thing is, dumb can be very, very dangerous.
[01:58:22.451 --> 01:58:25.573]  Dumb gave us World War I. Dumb gave us the Great Depression.
[01:58:26.053 --> 01:58:29.976]  So dumb can bring a massive global disaster for the whole world.
[01:58:29.996 --> 01:58:30.636]  No, no, I agree.
[01:58:30.716 --> 01:58:33.798]  Dumb people with major power are the most dangerous thing there is.
[01:58:35.143 --> 01:58:35.523]  Exactly.
[01:58:35.644 --> 01:58:37.546]  I mean, Tucker made this point the other day.
[01:58:37.566 --> 01:58:43.592]  He said, you know, it's not just that they're morally degenerate, it's that they're intellectually incapable and incompetent.
[01:58:44.172 --> 01:58:48.437]  And, you know, when Victoria Nuland is running our foreign policy, we are in a bad place.
[01:58:48.817 --> 01:58:55.184]  We're in the same place the Ottomans and the Brits and the Germans and the Russians were before World War I, and their empires were gone in a decade.
[01:58:55.684 --> 01:58:57.245]  So, that's the scary part.
[01:58:57.325 --> 01:58:59.305]  We're winning on the substance of the arguments.
[01:58:59.345 --> 01:59:01.226]  We're winning on the moral of the arguments.
[01:59:01.266 --> 01:59:02.746]  We're winning with the American people.
[01:59:03.026 --> 01:59:07.787]  We've broken through the ability for them to try to firewall us out from the American people.
[01:59:07.807 --> 01:59:12.889]  But the corrupt, hijacked American empire, globalist controlled, is committing seppuku right now.
[01:59:12.989 --> 01:59:13.429]  Suicide.
[01:59:14.724 --> 01:59:15.004]  Correct.
[01:59:15.184 --> 01:59:18.487]  And they think they're committing homicide, but in fact they're committing suicide.
[01:59:18.847 --> 01:59:22.751]  But the dangerous thing is, do they take the rest of us with them in the process?
[01:59:23.351 --> 01:59:25.093]  And that's where we have to do everything we can.
[01:59:25.113 --> 01:59:26.714]  And why can't they be reasoned with?
[01:59:26.794 --> 01:59:34.680]  Because I've met with globalists and things off record, because that's, you know, private meetings, what journalists do, and they still think they're going to win, even though they know they're in trouble.
[01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:37.763]  Like, they don't know how to change course.
[01:59:37.803 --> 01:59:42.547]  They just double down, double down, double down, attack, attack, attack.
[01:59:43.916 --> 01:59:45.718]  Well, it's very much late-stage colonial empire.
[01:59:45.918 --> 01:59:49.022]  I mean, as you read in all the histories, this is classic.
[01:59:49.522 --> 01:59:50.844]  We've seen this history before.
[01:59:51.404 --> 01:59:54.047]  And it's the classic sign of a dying empire.
[01:59:54.447 --> 01:59:59.213]  That, you know, an intellectually incestuous empire of people that are too disconnected.
[01:59:59.633 --> 02:00:02.116]  Marie Antoinette, let them eat cake.
[02:00:02.156 --> 02:00:03.517]  Oh, it's like 410 in Rome!
[02:00:04.469 --> 02:00:08.373]  Roman had a few battles with the barbarians, but they were like, hey, we got 200,000 men coming down.
[02:00:08.393 --> 02:00:10.434]  They're like, I'm too busy drinking wine and having sex.
[02:00:10.755 --> 02:00:11.575]  And they got destroyed.
[02:00:11.916 --> 02:00:13.317]  They just, they just are delusional.
[02:00:13.337 --> 02:00:15.158]  They're like, look at my big marble columns.
[02:00:15.198 --> 02:00:16.700]  Look at all, no, we can't be defeated.
[02:00:18.317 --> 02:00:20.678]  Because they've never experienced it, they can't experience it.
[02:00:20.818 --> 02:00:33.104]  I mean, the Deep State has really been successfully challenged, assassinated one president, tried to assassinate another presidential candidate, you know, effectively created the Watergate scandal, was really behind it, more so than Nixon.
[02:00:33.524 --> 02:00:38.927]  They sidetracked other people, tried to take out other people, and then from 1988 to 2016, they ran the show.
[02:00:38.947 --> 02:00:39.907]  They had their puppets in there.
[02:00:42.569 --> 02:00:45.373]  And just like China, if any of their analysts tell them they're wrong, they get rid of them.
[02:00:45.193 --> 02:00:49.273]   and the deep state's unaccustomed to anybody successfully challenging them
[02:00:49.273 --> 02:00:53.592]   they're unaccustomed to people and just like China if any of their
[02:00:53.592 --> 02:00:56.792]   analysts tell them they're wrong they get rid of them so it's a bunch of yes
[02:00:56.792 --> 02:00:59.032]  men.
[02:00:58.984 --> 02:01:02.788]  I mean, China's now having to fake its data on youth unemployment because it's spiking so high.
[02:01:03.549 --> 02:01:05.691]  Because their real estate economy is imploding.
[02:01:05.711 --> 02:01:07.793]  They built one of the biggest bubbles in the history of the world.
[02:01:08.134 --> 02:01:11.717]  The biggest asset in the world, on paper, is Chinese real estate.
[02:01:11.757 --> 02:01:14.300]  It's probably not worth a third of what it's currently listed at.
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:15.761]  And how did they get there?
[02:01:15.801 --> 02:01:17.422]  They got there by living in la-la land.
[02:01:17.682 --> 02:01:26.126]  By the same thing you get with any centralized, bureaucratized government or society or entity, you get people feeding what they want to hear rather than what the truth is.
[02:01:26.666 --> 02:01:27.567]  And that's what's happening.
[02:01:27.587 --> 02:01:28.447]  I mean, in D.C.
[02:01:28.487 --> 02:01:29.568]  they're totally disconnected.
[02:01:29.628 --> 02:01:37.652]  You would think a judge, in Owen Shorter's case, would think, maybe I shouldn't allow evidence of his press and speech activities to be grounds to punish him.
[02:01:38.212 --> 02:01:40.253]  Maybe that's a First Amendment violation.
[02:01:40.653 --> 02:01:42.994]  Maybe that's never been done in the history of America.
[02:01:43.054 --> 02:01:56.781]  And for those that aren't a lawyer who haven't read it, I read it like 10 times the last few weeks, in the recommended sentencing document it says, he didn't just talk about the election being stolen before January 6th or on it, he talked about it in May of this year, therefore we want jail time for his speech.
[02:01:56.801 --> 02:01:58.602]  I mean, it's like cut and dry.
[02:02:00.363 --> 02:02:13.254]  It's the only time I've ever seen in American legal history that a prosecutor has requested and a judge has granted a punishment based solely on press and speech activities.
[02:02:13.734 --> 02:02:15.996]  Completely First Amendment protected activities.
[02:02:16.076 --> 02:02:19.118]  Which also includes the right to petition government at your Congress, by the way.
[02:02:19.478 --> 02:02:23.882]  But not even including that, they focus entirely on constitutionally protected activity.
[02:02:24.222 --> 02:02:25.944]  Petitioning the government, press and speech.
[02:02:26.424 --> 02:02:28.867]  And for the sentencing part, it was just press and speech.
[02:02:29.207 --> 02:02:31.549]  It wasn't even anything he said on the day of January 6th.
[02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:34.212]  It's look at what he said on his TV show.
[02:02:34.552 --> 02:02:35.773]  Look at what he said before.
[02:02:35.854 --> 02:02:39.017]  So is that an attempt to intimidate the press or just pure arrogance?
[02:02:40.247 --> 02:02:41.228]  They want to set the precedent.
[02:02:41.488 --> 02:02:43.469]  They want to start to lock up people for press and speech.
[02:02:43.749 --> 02:02:44.369]  It's that simple.
[02:02:44.429 --> 02:02:46.610]  It's like when I talked about your cases with people.
[02:02:46.951 --> 02:02:51.833]  I said, they're using this to weaponize the legal system to go after press and speech and silence dissidents.
[02:02:52.394 --> 02:03:00.378]  If you voice anything that's a so-called conspiracy theory that they disapprove of, they want to say anybody offended can sue you into bankruptcy and oblivion.
[02:03:00.838 --> 02:03:05.702]  Now they want to say that if you say anything we don't like about the election, then we can lock you up.
[02:03:05.982 --> 02:03:07.724]  And we don't care if you're a member of the press.
[02:03:08.124 --> 02:03:10.266]  We don't care if it's purely speech that's the basis.
[02:03:10.466 --> 02:03:14.549]  And we don't care if you're the former president and likely future president of the United States.
[02:03:14.969 --> 02:03:22.415]  That's how dangerous, this is very, it's as brazen as when they killed Kennedy on the, you know, we're on the eve of the 60th anniversary of that assassination.
[02:03:22.856 --> 02:03:24.177]  It's as brazen as that.
[02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:28.539]  I mean, you see it with how Joe Biden is reacting to Robert Kennedy.
[02:03:28.579 --> 02:03:36.363]  Robert Kennedy says, hey, I would like Secret Service, there's been a lot of death threats, and he's the first person to ever be denied Secret Service protection that requested it.
[02:03:36.443 --> 02:03:43.426]  And as you know, Secret Service protection after his father was killed was given to major candidates because of his dad.
[02:03:44.527 --> 02:03:45.187]  That's exactly right.
[02:03:45.207 --> 02:03:48.309]  The law is for him, for his dad who he saw killed.
[02:03:49.537 --> 02:03:49.837]  Correct.
[02:03:50.377 --> 02:03:52.658]  And do you have a more blunt symbol than that?
[02:03:53.038 --> 02:03:56.379]  Than Biden saying, nope, I know that there's a risk you die.
[02:03:56.539 --> 02:03:58.340]  I'm going to make sure that that risk goes up.
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:00.721]  I mean, you couldn't have a more blunt statement.
[02:04:01.101 --> 02:04:02.401]  That's why Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:04:02.441 --> 02:04:08.664]  this week came out and said, wrote a letter to the Democratic National Committee and said that this is a rigged primary.
[02:04:08.844 --> 02:04:09.964]  He's not like Bernie Sanders.
[02:04:09.984 --> 02:04:12.325]  He's not going to hide under the sand and go home when he loses.
[02:04:12.966 --> 02:04:18.194]  Uh, Kennedy's like, look, if you rig the game, then I'm going to consider running as an independent or third party candidate.
[02:04:18.214 --> 02:04:23.423]  You're either going to fix the Democratic Party, or the Democratic Party is dead to me, to my family, to my personal supporters.
[02:04:23.443 --> 02:04:25.186]  And for folks who don't know, explain what they've done.
[02:04:26.707 --> 02:04:27.648]  Trying to steal elections.
[02:04:27.688 --> 02:04:29.949]  Trying to disqualify MTG and Gozer.
[02:04:30.749 --> 02:04:31.490]  Indicting Trump.
[02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:32.550]  Admitting it's for the election.
[02:04:32.590 --> 02:04:34.451]  Biden saying we're going to do it.
[02:04:34.511 --> 02:04:42.656]  But in the case of what's happening with RFK Jr., they admittedly are saying you can't campaign or we'll bar you from the ballot.
[02:04:42.696 --> 02:04:43.757]  I mean, this is next level.
[02:04:43.977 --> 02:04:46.278]  We're not having debates and you're not allowed to campaign.
[02:04:46.738 --> 02:04:47.379]  Come on, people.
[02:04:48.604 --> 02:04:51.765]  Not only that, they were demanding that if any elections were held, he pay for them.
[02:04:52.265 --> 02:04:53.945]  He himself personally paid for them.
[02:04:54.486 --> 02:05:01.147]  So, they say, if you want there to be any elections taken, any primary votes taken, you're gonna help, you're gonna pay for the cost of it.
[02:05:01.628 --> 02:05:06.849]  So since when does the president of an incumbent party not get challenged in the primary?
[02:05:07.169 --> 02:05:10.470]  I mean, that's total election fraud right there on his face!
[02:05:11.778 --> 02:05:14.099]  Yeah, I mean, and it's escalating.
[02:05:14.119 --> 02:05:18.982]  If you run in certain states and you get any votes or you even campaign, we're going to deny you your delegates.
[02:05:19.422 --> 02:05:23.465]  Secondly, we're going to stack a bunch of superdelegates in there so that your delegates don't count.
[02:05:23.865 --> 02:05:27.787]  Third, if you want any primary to be held, you're going to have to pay for it yourself personally.
[02:05:28.147 --> 02:05:32.051]  Fourth, all the DNC resources are being used explicitly to help Joe Biden.
[02:05:32.932 --> 02:05:34.214]  How is that a primary process?
[02:05:34.274 --> 02:05:38.198]  Fifth, we're not going to allow any debates to occur whatsoever during the entire process.
[02:05:38.498 --> 02:05:45.966]  And last but not least, if you're unhappy with any of this, we know there's escalating death threats, and we know that we've coordinated and conspired to censor you directly.
[02:05:46.366 --> 02:05:58.068]  Since 2021, as a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals just found, and in joining the White House from continuing to do it, the main target of that disinformation so-called campaign was Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:05:58.469 --> 02:06:09.771]  We're actually going to put your life at risk and make you spend money on personal security because we're not going to let any Secret Service provide any support for you, even when the Secret Service apparently requested that they be allowed to do so.
[02:06:10.291 --> 02:06:11.992]  That is how insane this is.
[02:06:12.192 --> 02:06:14.554]  This is what happens when you get Caligula, right?
[02:06:14.574 --> 02:06:16.795]  It's one thing when Caesar crosses the Rubicon.
[02:06:17.015 --> 02:06:19.177]  Well, now Caligula has crossed the Rubicon.
[02:06:19.577 --> 02:06:22.279]  And that puts us in a very frightening place.
[02:06:22.319 --> 02:06:27.102]  And for those who know their history across the globe, they understand what a dangerous time it is.
[02:06:27.462 --> 02:06:30.164]  And that means now is the time we have to be active.
[02:06:30.204 --> 02:06:30.484]  This is 1775.
[02:06:32.345 --> 02:06:40.938]  And what either is going to come forth is 1776 or 1984 and it's going to be up to us, the American people, to decide which path we take.
[02:06:41.518 --> 02:06:43.241]  Let's shift gears into Russia.
[02:06:44.349 --> 02:06:48.031]  Just last year, Biden said, if we give them Abrams or F-16s, that's World War III.
[02:06:48.171 --> 02:06:53.053]  It is, on the threat continuum, the rank corporation analysis and the Russians' own doctrine.
[02:06:53.513 --> 02:06:59.196]  Now they're giving them heavy cruise missiles and long-range missiles, and they're blowing up the Russian fleet in its own port.
[02:07:00.116 --> 02:07:01.637]  I mean, this is just madness.
[02:07:01.657 --> 02:07:06.279]  So a year ago, or less than a year ago, 10 months ago, Biden says, we can't do this, it's World War III.
[02:07:06.319 --> 02:07:07.620]  Now it's like, full scale.
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:11.722]  I mean, the establishment is gone beyond cuckoo.
[02:07:13.450 --> 02:07:18.812]  And it even gets worse because, you know, I mean, I know Dinesh D'Souza's got a film called Police State coming out.
[02:07:19.272 --> 02:07:21.873]  I mean, you had those films out more than a decade ago.
[02:07:22.153 --> 02:07:23.373]  We're just seeing that reality.
[02:07:23.793 --> 02:07:37.778]  Zelensky and one of the weirdest people to show up for a deep state front person, this trainee from Las Vegas who was trying to infiltrate the Republican Party, ends up being the Ukraine Defense Department spokesperson.
[02:07:38.238 --> 02:07:49.207]  Who is cheerleading the efforts to torture, imprison, and kill and execute Gonzalo Lira, the American citizen over there, who's now still in prison, simply for his speech.
[02:07:49.728 --> 02:07:55.192]  And his trainee spokesperson suggested that Ukraine is going to take actions around the world.
[02:07:55.713 --> 02:07:58.055]  Not only that, what did Zelensky say this past week?
[02:07:58.415 --> 02:08:05.261]  He said it's sure, you know, he doesn't know how all the Ukrainian refugees might react to any country that doesn't do whatever they demand.
[02:08:05.976 --> 02:08:06.917]  What does that sound like?
[02:08:06.997 --> 02:08:13.341]  It sounds like we're going to have home-grown Ukrainian terrorism throughout Europe and the United States!
[02:08:13.961 --> 02:08:26.270]  So they're threatening terrorism, they're threatening to target anybody who is a political opponent of their regime, they're saying they're going to extort them until they continue to escalate and divorce... Mark, since you mention it, let's play the clip.
[02:08:26.610 --> 02:08:29.412]  This is like Mars Attacks, where the alien poses as a female.
[02:08:29.772 --> 02:08:34.896]  You've got this dude who says, kill all Ukrainians, Heil Hitler, basically.
[02:08:35.416 --> 02:08:45.281]  And then now this dude is up there saying we have Ukrainians inside America and we have sleeper cells and it's a dude as the main spokesperson for the Ukrainians.
[02:08:45.321 --> 02:08:45.681]  Here it is.
[02:08:48.234 --> 02:08:55.640]  That their obsessive focus on a Ukrainian volunteer is simply allowing the light of the Ukrainian nation's honesty to shine brightly.
[02:08:56.661 --> 02:09:08.993]   Next week the teeth of the Russian devils will gnash ever harder and their rabid mouths will foam an uncontrollable frenzy as the world will see a favorite Kremlin propagandist Pay for their crimes.
[02:09:09.734 --> 02:09:12.718]  And this puppet of Putin is only the first.
[02:09:13.399 --> 02:09:24.634]  Russia's war criminal propagandists will all be hunted down and justice will be served as we in Ukraine are led on this mission by faith in God, liberty, and complete liberation.
[02:09:27.978 --> 02:09:32.506]  So, we got sleeper cells in America, and you got the Nazis a few weeks ago in Florida.
[02:09:32.987 --> 02:09:35.251]  Hail Biden, we're gonna get everybody.
[02:09:35.271 --> 02:09:40.079]  I mean, I made the Mars Attacks joke, but I mean, this is basically what it's like.
[02:09:39.918 --> 02:09:41.918]  Alright, here it is.
[02:09:41.918 --> 02:10:01.918]  [Music]
[02:10:01.918 --> 02:10:03.918]  Trump gets back in.
[02:10:03.266 --> 02:10:05.266]  here comes the Ukrainians.
[02:10:05.266 --> 02:10:14.266]   Maybe the lady from Ukraine, the dude, is actually Zelensky with a wig on.
[02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:18.095]  Hi there.
[02:10:18.574 --> 02:10:20.574]  Are you interested in the White House?
[02:10:20.574 --> 02:10:22.574]  [Screaming]
[02:10:22.574 --> 02:10:24.574]  [Music]
[02:10:24.574 --> 02:10:26.574]  [Music]
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:28.141]  I'm the press secretary.
[02:10:28.881 --> 02:10:29.962]  My name's Jerry Ross.
[02:10:30.882 --> 02:10:31.583]  Maybe you've heard of me?
[02:10:34.275 --> 02:10:36.097]  You wouldn't believe the pressure of my job.
[02:10:38.659 --> 02:10:40.659]  It's nice to see a new face.
[02:10:40.659 --> 02:10:49.139]   There's the Ukrainian defense minister. Alright guys you found one of the clips. Find it inside the White House. We're
[02:10:49.139 --> 02:10:53.659]   not trying to kill everybody. Barnes, what else do you want to hit when you come back? There's so much to cover. What
[02:10:53.659 --> 02:10:54.659]  do you want to hit next?
[02:10:54.659 --> 02:10:57.659]  Uh, you know, maybe we could talk about a range of topics.
[02:10:58.272 --> 02:10:59.793]  The housing market is concerning.
[02:10:59.853 --> 02:11:01.894]  Sidney Powell's going to go to trial in October.
[02:11:01.954 --> 02:11:02.834]  Televised trial.
[02:11:02.854 --> 02:11:04.355]  I hope she does a really good job.
[02:11:04.375 --> 02:11:07.497]  This is the first opportunity to really present election evidence.
[02:11:08.017 --> 02:11:09.498]  Man, they're moving these trials quick!
[02:11:10.876 --> 02:11:12.637]  Yeah, she wants a trial fast.
[02:11:12.717 --> 02:11:13.878]  That's an interesting choice.
[02:11:14.819 --> 02:11:16.920]  So, she severed from Trump.
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:17.861]  That happened today.
[02:11:17.881 --> 02:11:27.888]  I hope they put, you know, there's a lot of great, John Eastman has presented a great defense in the joke of a disbarment proceeding before the California State Bar, which is increasingly an embarrassment.
[02:11:27.908 --> 02:11:29.989]  And then we got the governor of New Mexico and the gun grab.
[02:11:30.029 --> 02:11:37.214]  I want to talk about it all with the great Robert Barnes, straight ahead, or as the left calls him, Bobby B.
[02:11:40.271 --> 02:11:40.892]  What a great guy.
[02:11:40.932 --> 02:11:41.572]  We'll be right back.
[02:11:41.632 --> 02:11:48.037]  I want to shift gears into the unconstitutional mega-tyranny grab in New Mexico coming up to guns.
[02:11:48.518 --> 02:11:49.679]  How that's blowing up their face and more.
[02:11:49.699 --> 02:11:53.382]  But if you want to be trendy now, you've got to be a man that's now a woman.
[02:11:54.202 --> 02:12:02.449]  So we have the tranny spokesperson for Ukraine saying we're going to come after Americans inside the U.S., we're going to kill the press, we're going to attack everybody.
[02:12:02.509 --> 02:12:06.272]  It made me think of the aliens in Mars attacks.
[02:12:07.338 --> 02:12:09.919]  Posing as a woman to get in the White House.
[02:12:10.479 --> 02:12:11.279]  Well, then I'm a woman.
[02:12:12.079 --> 02:12:15.440]  And I am now the Russian spokesperson, and I'm a woman.
[02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:17.521]  So you've got to listen to everything I say.
[02:12:18.081 --> 02:12:19.941]  I've got a pink fur Russian hat.
[02:12:20.901 --> 02:12:21.462]  I'm not sure.
[02:12:21.502 --> 02:12:23.022]  Somebody was just in my office.
[02:12:23.062 --> 02:12:24.642]  I just found this a minute ago.
[02:12:24.662 --> 02:12:26.723]  They delivered me stuff that listeners sent us.
[02:12:26.763 --> 02:12:27.523]  Got some great cigars.
[02:12:27.543 --> 02:12:28.603]  I want to thank the folks that sent that.
[02:12:29.023 --> 02:12:29.724]  But look at this.
[02:12:29.944 --> 02:12:31.024]  I mean, now you've got to listen.
[02:12:31.084 --> 02:12:31.784]  I'm a woman now.
[02:12:31.804 --> 02:12:34.445]  You've got to listen to me, just like Mars Attacks.
[02:12:34.465 --> 02:12:34.845]  There it is.
[02:12:36.789 --> 02:12:45.778]  Russia hates the truth that their obsessive focus on a Ukrainian volunteer is simply allowing the light of the Ukrainian nation's honesty to shine brightly.
[02:12:46.799 --> 02:12:59.131]   Next week, the teeth of the Russian devils will gnash ever harder, and their rabid mouths will foam in uncontrollable frenzy as the world will see a favorite Kremlin propagandist Pay for their crimes.
[02:12:59.852 --> 02:13:02.835]  And this puppet of Putin is only the first.
[02:13:03.315 --> 02:13:08.675]   Russia's war criminal propagandists will all be hunted down and justice will be served
[02:13:08.675 --> 02:13:15.674]   as we in Ukraine are led on this mission by faith in God, liberty and complete liberation.
[02:13:16.674 --> 02:13:23.674]  [Music]
[02:13:23.674 --> 02:13:29.674]   That's a Ukrainian national spokesperson promising to unleash sleeper cells all over the world
[02:13:29.674 --> 02:13:31.674]  including America and kill us.
[02:13:32.114 --> 02:13:34.477]  Well, if Trump got back in the White House, look out!
[02:13:34.777 --> 02:13:36.777]  Here she comes.
[02:13:36.777 --> 02:14:01.777]  [Music]
[02:14:01.777 --> 02:14:03.777]  That's what it is, pedophiles versus women.
[02:14:03.798 --> 02:14:06.102]  They destroy our humanity.
[02:14:07.805 --> 02:14:08.926]  There's Trump and Melania.
[02:14:08.946 --> 02:14:12.071]  I'm gonna stop joking around here.
[02:14:11.891 --> 02:14:13.891]  I don't know if this is too much fun.
[02:14:13.891 --> 02:14:28.891]  [music]
[02:14:28.891 --> 02:14:30.891]  How dare the president attack a woman.
[02:14:31.419 --> 02:14:34.381]  Don't shoot!
[02:14:36.623 --> 02:14:41.968]  Actual footage of the Ukrainian press secretary attacking the White House.
[02:14:41.988 --> 02:14:44.410]  She did just say she will attack Americans and kill them.
[02:14:45.190 --> 02:14:45.751]  Which is liberal.
[02:14:47.412 --> 02:14:49.594]  The FBI loves it.
[02:14:49.614 --> 02:14:50.635]  Oh my God, they just shot a woman.
[02:14:51.756 --> 02:14:53.756]  Well that would be good sensitivity training for that.
[02:14:53.756 --> 02:15:00.396]  Thank you Mitch.
[02:15:00.610 --> 02:15:01.190]  It's my job.
[02:15:01.751 --> 02:15:01.911]  Jimmy!
[02:15:03.853 --> 02:15:04.954]  I am Jen Psaki.
[02:15:05.194 --> 02:15:07.577]  I am the press secretary.
[02:15:07.597 --> 02:15:09.659]  Alright, I'm gonna quit joking around Robert Barnes.
[02:15:09.679 --> 02:15:10.700]  This is deadly serious.
[02:15:12.141 --> 02:15:15.024]  Let's, uh, shift gears.
[02:15:16.209 --> 02:15:18.550]  into New Mexico and beyond.
[02:15:18.650 --> 02:15:19.470]  What are they thinking?
[02:15:19.510 --> 02:15:34.933]  We know it came out a year ago, that a couple years ago, the Feds, the Justice Department, told in Virginia and other states, declare parents protesting pedophile time, drag queen pedophile time, and critical race theory and all this, as terrorists, call for the Feds to come in.
[02:15:35.353 --> 02:15:37.934]  Looks to me, I'm guessing, this governor got put up to this.
[02:15:37.954 --> 02:15:38.594]  You think I'm right?
[02:15:39.174 --> 02:15:41.714]  Or is she on her own, and then we got this federal injunction?
[02:15:41.734 --> 02:15:43.995]  Because that's really jumping the shark there.
[02:15:45.410 --> 02:15:46.151]  Well, it's a test run.
[02:15:46.171 --> 02:16:00.360]  I mean, it's what we've talked about ever since 2020, which is that they're trying to see whether they can put into the Constitution what our founding generation understood needed to never be there, but that was the great fatal flaw of the Weimar Republic.
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:05.183]  I mean, the Weimar Constitution was considered the greatest constitution of Europe at the time.
[02:16:05.603 --> 02:16:09.866]  So how did it lead to the rise of the Nazis when two-thirds of Germans never voted for the Nazis?
[02:16:10.286 --> 02:16:18.750]  Real simple, there was an emergency exception written into the Constitution, and it allowed them to carve up the entire rules and rights protected under the Constitution.
[02:16:19.170 --> 02:16:24.693]  So I think ever since they got away with it during the pandemic, they've been wondering, can we use it for another pandemic?
[02:16:24.773 --> 02:16:26.133]  Can we use it for something else?
[02:16:26.213 --> 02:16:27.674]  Can we use it for climate change?
[02:16:27.954 --> 02:16:29.715]  Can we use it for gun violence?
[02:16:29.755 --> 02:16:33.557]  Can we come up with some other pretext to suspend everybody's rights?
[02:16:33.957 --> 02:16:35.818]  And I think she was just doing a test run.
[02:16:36.414 --> 02:16:39.355]  And the test run didn't work, so they'll step back from it.
[02:16:39.635 --> 02:16:53.800]  Federal credit to Gun Owners of America, unlike the NRA, Gun Owners of America has actually been active, along with the Firearms Policy Coalition, got active, won an injunction this week against her order, saying this is clearly unconstitutional in violation of the Second Amendment.
[02:16:54.301 --> 02:16:59.783]  Babylon Bee made the joke that she was thinking about suspending the First Amendment because of protests about the Second Amendment suspension.
[02:16:59.983 --> 02:17:03.124]  But she did say in her press conference she could suspend the first two.
[02:17:07.509 --> 02:17:08.449]  I mean, that's just crazy.
[02:17:08.489 --> 02:17:10.310]  So it's just a wanton power grab.
[02:17:13.092 --> 02:17:13.692]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[02:17:14.032 --> 02:17:20.175]  It's like what you're seeing right down the road there in Austin, where you have the attorney, the only attorney general to take the lead against the 2020 election.
[02:17:20.515 --> 02:17:35.462]  The only attorney general to say he is willing to go out there and investigate Pfizer and Moderna about the COVID-19 vaccine related to Brooke Jackson's case that we have in Beaumont, Texas, that the federal court reactivated last week and said we can continue to pursue.
[02:17:35.982 --> 02:17:44.131]  The only attorney general to sue the Biden administration more often than any other attorney general in the country on core issues of immigration and the rest.
[02:17:44.451 --> 02:17:49.657]  Ken Paxton, they're trying to impeach him in the trial this week and Austin showed it was completely bogus!
[02:17:49.677 --> 02:17:54.222]  By the way, I meant to cover that, Owen covered it, but people that haven't seen the clips, I'll try to grab some right now.
[02:17:54.242 --> 02:17:56.725]  I sent them to the crew days ago, but never got to it.
[02:17:57.987 --> 02:18:05.430]  The lawyers for Paxton are like, so did you have any evidence to the state agency when you went and reported him to the FBI for crimes?
[02:18:05.450 --> 02:18:06.331]  They go, no, no evidence.
[02:18:07.531 --> 02:18:09.592]  But all the news, they said they had evidence.
[02:18:10.973 --> 02:18:11.373]  Completely.
[02:18:11.413 --> 02:18:22.038]  I mean, in the House, how did half of the so-called Republicans in the House, when I was trying to tell people why it was you couldn't get a fair trial even in Texas, said the problem is the Bush regime.
[02:18:22.478 --> 02:18:27.380]  I mean, how did half of the Republicans in the House vote for this complete joke of an impeachment?
[02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:31.402]  In a rushed process that turned out to have no evidence, none, zero.
[02:18:31.842 --> 02:18:45.128]  Unlike what the media said about the Biden impeachment, in which there is overwhelming evidence of his guilt, and they claimed it was without evidence to open the inquiry, there was literally no evidence as proven at the trial this week in Austin.
[02:18:45.468 --> 02:18:53.531]  They simply tried to railroad him, it was a coup, and it was a coup led by the Bush-Rhino-Corrupt-Old-Oil-Man ring in Texas.
[02:18:55.772 --> 02:19:00.595]  And going back to the kind of people that helped facilitate the Kennedy assassination in 1963.
[02:19:01.295 --> 02:19:04.697]  And it shows the problem with the Texas Republican establishment.
[02:19:04.797 --> 02:19:13.382]  It is an embarrassment that the biggest populist advocate in the state of Texas, they tried to remove from office based on nothing at all.
[02:19:13.662 --> 02:19:17.044]  All he did was his job, and for it they tried to impeach him.
[02:19:19.205 --> 02:19:23.207]  And since you raised that, let's play one of the clips from just earlier this week.
[02:19:24.807 --> 02:19:25.508]  Let me get this straight.
[02:19:26.208 --> 02:19:31.092]  You went to the FBI and reported him for potential crimes without any evidence.
[02:19:31.132 --> 02:19:31.973]  Do I have that correct?
[02:19:34.355 --> 02:19:40.339]  We went to the FBI and reported our belief that criminal activity had occurred.
[02:19:40.459 --> 02:19:41.460]  That was not my question.
[02:19:42.281 --> 02:19:44.383]  Witness needs to answer the question, yes or no.
[02:19:44.403 --> 02:19:47.585]  Should I ask it again, Mr. Vassar?
[02:19:47.985 --> 02:19:48.206]  Please.
[02:19:50.063 --> 02:19:51.083]  I want to get this straight.
[02:19:51.203 --> 02:20:00.786]  You went to the FBI on September 30th with your compatriots and reported the elected Attorney General of this state for a crime without any evidence.
[02:20:02.346 --> 02:20:02.586]  Yes?
[02:20:04.367 --> 02:20:04.747]  That's right.
[02:20:05.027 --> 02:20:05.867]  We took no evidence.
[02:20:09.968 --> 02:20:13.969]  And he goes on to the exchange to say we never had, but the media said, oh, they had all this evidence.
[02:20:15.527 --> 02:20:15.967]  There's none of it!
[02:20:16.228 --> 02:20:20.430]  Remember, they claimed that supposedly he had the contractor fix up his kitchen?
[02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:23.312]  It turned out there was never even any changes in his kitchen!
[02:20:23.572 --> 02:20:24.612]  I mean, it was all fake!
[02:20:24.752 --> 02:20:26.654]  It was a fake case, all the way through!
[02:20:27.294 --> 02:20:35.719]  And luckily it got exposed, because at least they actually had a trial, a trial on the merits, there in the Texas State Senate, but never should have got this far!
[02:20:36.079 --> 02:20:42.783]  What are these House Republicans, every single House Republican in Texas, in the Texas Legislature- Well, sure, sure, sure, but let me just interrupt you.
[02:20:43.103 --> 02:20:52.525]  I'm not a lawyer like you, a star lawyer, but the politicized, controlled FBI and Justice Department, the feds passed on Paxson because the guy's a straight arrow.
[02:20:53.866 --> 02:21:01.508]  And like you said, oh, a builder that was a donator to him gave him a better deal on his kitchen and he didn't even do that.
[02:21:02.728 --> 02:21:16.031]  So you've got Hunter Biden, pedophilia, Chinese agent, open borders, human smuggling, World War III, total crime everywhere, and then meanwhile, oh, somebody fixed his kitchen, and then that's not even true.
[02:21:17.526 --> 02:21:17.866]  Completely!
[02:21:17.886 --> 02:21:20.168]  I mean, it shows the absurdity of the disparity.
[02:21:20.648 --> 02:21:25.811]  I mean, the only people being targeted are those that are on the populist, freedom, liberty side of the aisle.
[02:21:26.291 --> 02:21:29.593]  The people that are being covered up for are the most corrupt that we've ever had.
[02:21:29.993 --> 02:21:32.915]  I mean, it's very much Caligula running America right now.
[02:21:33.355 --> 02:21:35.196]  And we saw how that ended for Rome.
[02:21:35.376 --> 02:21:35.917]  Not well.
[02:21:36.517 --> 02:21:40.299]  And so the question is, how much can we evade the horrendous consequences?
[02:21:40.699 --> 02:21:49.542]  When you see states like California, Pat Nellie trying to disbar a great constitutional law professor, Professor Eastman, who this week had tons of great expert testimony.
[02:21:49.582 --> 02:21:53.043]  Anybody who says, hey, what's the evidence that the 2020 election was wrong?
[02:21:53.324 --> 02:21:56.325]  Look at Eastman's defense in the California disbarment proceedings.
[02:21:56.585 --> 02:22:00.106]  He put up massive amounts of evidence, legal, factual, and other.
[02:22:00.185 --> 02:22:04.024]   hundreds of hours of Democrats showing election fraud. Both sides do it. They
[02:22:04.024 --> 02:22:08.665]   obviously do 80% of it. Again everybody, that's why upwards of 80% of
[02:22:08.665 --> 02:22:11.614]  Republicans think it was stolen. 47% of Democrats.
[02:22:11.614 --> 02:22:17.744]   Everybody knows these elections are screwed up. Completely.
[02:22:15.876 --> 02:22:17.597]  And so, what's California busy doing?
[02:22:17.957 --> 02:22:29.861]  California's busy saying that they're gonna take, that if you don't allow your kid to be forced to undergo trans treatment, and have their pronenet, their name changed from he or her, their gender identity changed by the school... Again, what a cult!
[02:22:29.921 --> 02:22:30.461]  What a cult!
[02:22:30.601 --> 02:22:41.204]  You have a child, they secretly convince them at school when they're eight, or five, to be in a program, and then they'll take your child away if you don't affirm their cult.
[02:22:41.304 --> 02:22:43.865]  I mean, that's checkmate right there we put up with it.
[02:22:44.901 --> 02:22:45.282]  Completely.
[02:22:45.342 --> 02:22:52.076]  I mean, anybody who can, if there's any way you can financially survive, it's the same advice I've been giving clients for more than a decade.
[02:22:52.096 --> 02:22:52.958]  Get out of California!
[02:22:54.358 --> 02:22:55.879]  Yeah, you have no other choice.
[02:22:55.999 --> 02:22:56.779]  You got to get out.
[02:22:57.079 --> 02:22:59.500]  They're now coming for your kids, quite literally.
[02:22:59.800 --> 02:23:02.762]  They're going to try to force them to take drugs they don't need and don't want?
[02:23:03.142 --> 02:23:08.184]  They're now going to force them to undergo gender transition at the will of some wacky teacher?
[02:23:08.464 --> 02:23:16.287]  We've all seen the meme, or we should have, where it shows a pregnant woman, and the doctor's got a stethoscope to her stomach, and she says, doctor, is it a boy or a girl?
[02:23:16.307 --> 02:23:19.609]  And he said, ma'am, we let your kindergarten teacher decide.
[02:23:21.527 --> 02:23:23.189]  Yeah, exactly!
[02:23:23.429 --> 02:23:24.150]  It's law!
[02:23:24.470 --> 02:23:26.152]  It's going to be law in California!
[02:23:26.532 --> 02:23:43.810]  Now luckily, great ruling by a federal judge this week in California that even California's now withdrawn their crazy medical misinformation law where they were going to try to disbar and take away the right to practice of various doctors or medical professionals who challenge the COVID-19 narrative.
[02:23:45.112 --> 02:23:54.162]  And it was so offensive to the First Amendment that they couldn't defend it in front of the federal courts, and so they're now having to withdraw the law, thanks to those doctors that brought that suit.
[02:23:54.342 --> 02:23:55.764]  And by the way, that leads me to the next point.
[02:23:55.784 --> 02:23:58.307]  You're heavily involved in suing Pfizer, RFK, the key suits.
[02:23:59.828 --> 02:24:08.877]  I told everybody 27 days ago that my sources said they're going to try to roll back masks, vaccine mandates, all of it by the middle of September.
[02:24:08.937 --> 02:24:10.458]  You now see it everywhere.
[02:24:11.099 --> 02:24:16.684]  The appointed New York governor, you know, saying, oh, your shots didn't work before, you need new ones.
[02:24:16.764 --> 02:24:18.525]  So what an admission there.
[02:24:19.647 --> 02:24:21.168]  What's on your radar dealing with that?
[02:24:21.228 --> 02:24:24.311]  Then I want to move on to Matt Gaetz and to Kev McCarthy.
[02:24:26.143 --> 02:24:37.287]  People should watch a big New York case where the governor tried to announce her right to just lock people up and quarantine them without going through any of the quarantine procedures and protocols.
[02:24:37.807 --> 02:24:41.528]  And her authority to do so is being challenged in the New York courts.
[02:24:41.928 --> 02:24:43.969]  This is the kind of power they would like to unleash.
[02:24:44.328 --> 02:24:47.588]  and a new set of COVID restrictions.
[02:24:47.588 --> 02:24:51.788]   I mean, they wanna change the election rules, they wanna change the narrative,
[02:24:51.788 --> 02:24:59.949]   and the group that's massively shifting away from Biden to Trump, but only to Trump, are working class millennials.
[02:24:59.949 --> 02:25:03.667]   And that's a voter group that's about to have to start paying back student loans.
[02:25:03.667 --> 02:25:05.929]  But the blacks too, right?
[02:25:05.929 --> 02:25:10.929]   Oh yeah, particularly within the working class millennial community, it's overwhelmingly Hispanic
[02:25:10.929 --> 02:25:14.507]   and black Americans within them that are trending heavily to Trump.
[02:25:14.407 --> 02:25:15.367]  And the reason is simple.
[02:25:15.747 --> 02:25:18.288]  Trump, peace abroad, prosperity at home.
[02:25:18.568 --> 02:25:20.588]  Biden, war abroad, poverty at home.
[02:25:20.668 --> 02:25:22.129]  They're getting hammered economically.
[02:25:22.389 --> 02:25:23.189]  Can't afford a home.
[02:25:23.469 --> 02:25:25.089]  Can't afford a car.
[02:25:25.129 --> 02:25:25.990]  Savings exhausted.
[02:25:26.290 --> 02:25:27.610]  Credit card debt maxed out.
[02:25:28.010 --> 02:25:30.172]  But wages still behind grocery costs.
[02:25:30.432 --> 02:25:36.558]  They're just getting hand and every day, you know, Paul Krugman and Joe Biden are going out there telling them they're just nuts and the economy is great.
[02:25:36.698 --> 02:25:44.825]  And it just enrages them while they see billions and billions and billions go to Ukraine and the various foreign corrupt allies of the Biden administration.
[02:25:45.446 --> 02:25:48.749]  As Trump's been saying, I, as president, made you rich.
[02:25:49.249 --> 02:25:51.111]  Biden, as president, made his family rich.
[02:25:51.631 --> 02:25:57.972]  And that's a key resonant within the entire... I agree, but it's also admitted globalist policy that Trump broke with.
[02:25:58.012 --> 02:25:58.713]  He's not perfect.
[02:25:59.253 --> 02:26:00.933]  They want to make a sport of control us.
[02:26:01.653 --> 02:26:02.953]  That is the nature of it.
[02:26:02.973 --> 02:26:08.615]  So I don't get... I mean, I understand working class people see this, but what about the academics?
[02:26:08.695 --> 02:26:13.115]  Can't they see nuclear war with Russia that we're rapidly approaching is not good?
[02:26:13.436 --> 02:26:15.436]  Do they have no survival instincts?
[02:26:17.354 --> 02:26:21.316]  Their arrogance exceeds their competence, and that's where Tucker nailed it the other day.
[02:26:21.856 --> 02:26:23.437]  And that's going to continue on.
[02:26:23.777 --> 02:26:36.423]  It's like you would have thought, you know, as we look back in time, that the various leaders of the Russian and Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empire would have thought, you know, a global world war is probably not going to work out well for us.
[02:26:37.463 --> 02:26:38.924]  Well, let's explain to the Germans.
[02:26:39.404 --> 02:26:46.186]  I'm not lionizing the German General Staff at 1943, but two years before they failed, they went to Hitler and they said, sir, the U.S.
[02:26:46.246 --> 02:26:48.427]  is coming in, Russia's here, we're going to lose within two years.
[02:26:48.727 --> 02:26:52.068]  In fact, the German General Staff was the best military at the time in the world per capita.
[02:26:52.448 --> 02:26:57.950]  They predicted to the month when Berlin would fall with war game scenarios, and he said, get out of here, you're cowards.
[02:26:58.857 --> 02:27:05.982]  And then it ended up killing 10 million more German civilians, 22 million Germans, 27 million Russians, you know, millions of other people died.
[02:27:06.763 --> 02:27:09.105]  And I'm not calling because obviously Biden doesn't run things.
[02:27:09.125 --> 02:27:10.165]  We want him to be assassinated.
[02:27:10.185 --> 02:27:13.488]  But is there no Operation Valkyrie within the bureaucracy?
[02:27:13.948 --> 02:27:23.610]  But I guess because it is a bureaucracy that's promoted all these dimwits and pedos and weirdos that none of them are even competent to see, like the German General Staff, that you're going to lose.
[02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:29.732]  I mean, I'm not up here confidently saying to the CIA, you're going to lose, because I want to just say that as a confidence thing.
[02:27:30.092 --> 02:27:30.812]  They lose.
[02:27:31.172 --> 02:27:32.152]  America goes down.
[02:27:32.192 --> 02:27:33.032]  The dollar's dead.
[02:27:33.292 --> 02:27:36.533]  So as much as I hate our establishment, I don't want to even see the empire die.
[02:27:36.793 --> 02:27:39.894]  I want to ratchet it down and fix it and then, you know, pull back.
[02:27:40.034 --> 02:27:48.420]  But they're, they're just, it's like having a car engine that's redlining about to blow up, and they just ram the accelerator down, and I'm like, hey, I'm in the car with you, stop it!
[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:48.980]  They're like, no!
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:49.680]  Shut up!
[02:27:49.881 --> 02:27:50.941]  We'll put you in jail too!
[02:27:50.981 --> 02:27:51.702]  They're nuts!
[02:27:53.049 --> 02:27:53.890]  Completely, completely.
[02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:55.911]  And I think that's what's so frightening about him.
[02:27:56.291 --> 02:28:01.814]  I mean, it's very Madeleine Albright, Victoria Nuland, Hilary Clinton- Madeleine Albright, hey, did you kill 500,000 kids?
[02:28:01.834 --> 02:28:02.755]  Yeah, do it again!
[02:28:03.095 --> 02:28:06.497]  The woman can't pick up a two-pound dumbbell.
[02:28:06.717 --> 02:28:08.658]  She can't wipe her ugly fat ass.
[02:28:09.058 --> 02:28:12.521]  But she's slurping her lips about dead kids, man.
[02:28:13.041 --> 02:28:19.585]  The woman- exactly, it's a bunch of Madeleine Albrights, big, fat, ugly old women, starting World War III.
[02:28:19.625 --> 02:28:20.085]  It's bizarre!
[02:28:22.731 --> 02:28:31.176]  Yeah, it's people with pathologies combined with incompetencies that make them such an unusually dangerous, pernicious combination.
[02:28:31.636 --> 02:28:37.920]  I mean, you see, when someone like General Flynn gets in, they let General Flynn get in briefly so that he would identify all the white hats.
[02:28:38.260 --> 02:28:40.441]  I know because I represented some of those guys.
[02:28:41.061 --> 02:28:43.062]  Every single one of them got targeted by Mueller.
[02:28:43.423 --> 02:28:47.465]  After they remove Flynn, they target every single person that Flynn said was good and capable.
[02:28:47.604 --> 02:28:53.523]   to remove them from positions of power. Then you get COVID-19 and they use the vaccine mandate
[02:28:53.523 --> 02:28:58.564]   to purge the military of all of its dissidents, to purge anybody within the federal government
[02:28:58.564 --> 02:29:03.283]   of all of its dissidents. A lot of the people I represented in those cases were people they
[02:29:03.283 --> 02:29:07.204]   wanted out because those are independent thinkers. They don't want any independent
[02:29:07.204 --> 02:29:10.404]   thinkers in any position of power. - No, exactly, but why is it okay to triple sanctions
[02:29:10.404 --> 02:29:15.924]   after a decade and admittedly kill two million Iraqis, 500,000 kids and then enjoy it?
[02:29:16.556 --> 02:29:20.898]  I mean, these are just, and then she's a woman that you know, never even been in a fistfight.
[02:29:21.279 --> 02:29:22.620]  Never probably cooked her own meals.
[02:29:22.660 --> 02:29:25.021]  Her dad famously helped the Nazis round up Jews.
[02:29:25.301 --> 02:29:26.602]  She's got stolen art in her house.
[02:29:26.622 --> 02:29:27.723]  She's now in hell, of course.
[02:29:27.763 --> 02:29:28.223]  She's dead.
[02:29:28.704 --> 02:29:37.930]  But I mean, it's just, it makes me feel pathetic, though, that we're ruled over by a big, fat, ugly old woman with a big brooch on her chest that runs around murdering people.
[02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:39.611]  And it's like, the left likes that?
[02:29:41.812 --> 02:29:46.216]  Well, what it is, we let these incompetent inca- It's like the people writing films these days in Hollywood.
[02:29:46.497 --> 02:29:47.898]  You know, why are the films so woke?
[02:29:47.958 --> 02:29:52.603]  It's not just because of ideology and the idolatry of their ideology, but it's because they're not good writers.
[02:29:52.643 --> 02:29:53.764]  They're not actually competent.
[02:29:53.784 --> 02:29:54.565]  They're not smart.
[02:29:54.605 --> 02:29:57.528]  So they disguise their ineptitude with political bromitudes.
[02:29:57.928 --> 02:29:59.209]  And so that's what we're getting now.
[02:29:59.269 --> 02:30:02.392]  We're getting the same dynamic except these people run the State Department.
[02:30:02.652 --> 02:30:12.280]  These people, these are people like the people of the CIA who went and bribed analysts so that they would falsify data knowing that it came from Wuhan, that it was a lab leak connected to U.S.
[02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:19.686]  military intelligence, and the Chinese Communist Party, and Bill Gates who was involved, and Anthony Fauci who was involved in funding that particular facility.
[02:30:19.986 --> 02:30:22.308]  They bribed them to keep it a secret from the world!
[02:30:22.448 --> 02:30:23.329]  And let's expand on this.
[02:30:24.770 --> 02:30:27.171]  When I was growing up, my dad knew a lot of people.
[02:30:27.231 --> 02:30:29.471]  He had FBI agents who were playing chess with him, other people.
[02:30:29.872 --> 02:30:31.352]  I had family that was involved in black ops.
[02:30:31.692 --> 02:30:33.373]  And these guys all look like Superman.
[02:30:33.953 --> 02:30:36.434]  You look at the average FBI agent, they look like a meth head.
[02:30:36.834 --> 02:30:38.594]  You see the CIA, they look like rats.
[02:30:39.475 --> 02:30:44.036]  I mean, literally, our government wasn't perfect back then, but at least they put people in that were the overachievers.
[02:30:44.356 --> 02:30:51.798]  You know, the top, you know, soldier, you know, the top test scorer, the top Morse code person, the person that proved themselves.
[02:30:52.459 --> 02:30:53.899]  Now, they don't like that.
[02:30:54.239 --> 02:30:59.106]  They literally put scum that doesn't even understand how dangerous this is in charge.
[02:30:59.246 --> 02:31:03.672]  Because people that I knew growing up did not do crazy stuff because they understood the danger.
[02:31:03.872 --> 02:31:06.255]  They were competent and smart and they had respect for things.
[02:31:06.496 --> 02:31:08.639]  These people have no respect for anything.
[02:31:09.986 --> 02:31:14.270]  And it's what happens when you purge your entire apparatus of the Snowdens of the world.
[02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:22.697]  They're scared of anybody who's independent, anybody who's self-reflective, anybody who's knowledgeable about history, is a threat to their power.
[02:31:23.177 --> 02:31:26.680]  And consequently, they've purged everybody who has that mindset.
[02:31:26.700 --> 02:31:34.927]  That's just like Pol Pot, after he'd already killed millions of people at full control, he said, now, kill anybody that has glasses, because that means they had money and can read.
[02:31:34.967 --> 02:31:37.609]  Then it's like, kill anybody that has over an ADIQ.
[02:31:38.650 --> 02:31:42.914]  And they helped bring Pol Pot in, and he just killed him because they could write!
[02:31:44.695 --> 02:31:45.075]  Exactly!
[02:31:45.456 --> 02:31:52.721]  And it's what happens when you basically elevate, you purge independence, in the process you purge intelligence, true intelligence.
[02:31:53.022 --> 02:31:56.404]  Not some cognitive test intelligence, but real life intelligence.
[02:31:56.825 --> 02:32:03.290]  And the kind of intelligence that's self-reflective, the kind of intelligence that's history-informed, the kind of intelligence the audience has.
[02:32:03.670 --> 02:32:04.350]  I mean, think about it.
[02:32:04.410 --> 02:32:06.491]  It's the same mindset of the people who went after InfoWars.
[02:32:06.511 --> 02:32:10.273]  They assume, we sue you into oblivion, all your audience will go home and quit.
[02:32:10.393 --> 02:32:11.653]  They won't continue to support it.
[02:32:11.913 --> 02:32:15.955]  They won't go to InfoWarsStore.com and buy products that keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:32:16.255 --> 02:32:24.338]  Surely they'll feel that they'll become cowards and run for cover and feel shame and support the censorship because of the lawsuit.
[02:32:24.458 --> 02:32:29.440]  But that didn't happen because they underestimated the independence of the InfoWars audience.
[02:32:30.500 --> 02:32:31.240]  You're on fire here.
[02:32:31.260 --> 02:32:34.261]  You can join us again next week if you can, Robert Barnes, but let me just ask you this.
[02:32:35.322 --> 02:32:41.703]  Back to the situation with the overall government.
[02:32:41.844 --> 02:32:43.924]  What about Matt Gaetz going after McCarthy?
[02:32:44.304 --> 02:32:48.305]  McCarthy is not done when he said he would do with impeachment or even having subpoenas for Hunter Biden.
[02:32:48.866 --> 02:32:49.786]  Where do you see that going?
[02:32:50.959 --> 02:32:53.221]  I think he has no choice but to go forward with impeachment.
[02:32:53.441 --> 02:33:00.485]  He's trying to avoid the embarrassment of losing an impeachment vote in the House, knowing what damage that would do to a bunch of Republicans.
[02:33:00.806 --> 02:33:04.948]  And he's got so many idiot Republicans in the House that he has that risk.
[02:33:05.309 --> 02:33:06.910]  But I think he's got no choice.
[02:33:07.090 --> 02:33:08.451]  He made the promise of impeachment.
[02:33:08.791 --> 02:33:10.552]  The evidence is, oh, so overwhelming.
[02:33:10.912 --> 02:33:16.396]  Liberal law professors like Jonathan Turley are identifying all the ways in which impeachment is the only remedy.
[02:33:16.776 --> 02:33:16.977]  Why?
[02:33:17.037 --> 02:33:18.878]  Because the Justice Department is so corrupt.
[02:33:19.338 --> 02:33:24.601]  And the only question is, did the President Biden commit an impeachable offense while he's been President?
[02:33:24.741 --> 02:33:25.601]  Clearly he has!
[02:33:26.022 --> 02:33:29.043]  And what, I mean, as Trump has been pointing out, the big one is Ukraine!
[02:33:29.383 --> 02:33:34.586]  He's putting at risk of nuclear war because he's paying back the people that bribed him for over a decade!
[02:33:34.986 --> 02:33:37.948]  So, you couldn't have a more impeachable offense.
[02:33:38.507 --> 02:33:42.108]   It's something that can't be remedied by the election because we might all be dead by the
[02:33:42.108 --> 02:33:46.587]   time of the election because of this corrupt idiot, this Caligula in the White House, his
[02:33:46.587 --> 02:33:48.186]  prodigal in C the second.
[02:33:48.186 --> 02:33:51.447]   So I don't think we have any choice but to move forward with impeachment.
[02:33:51.447 --> 02:33:54.707]   And I don't think McCarthy has any choice but to move forward with impeachment.
[02:33:54.707 --> 02:33:58.747]   But credit to Matt Gaetz for holding his feet to the fire because otherwise I'm sure McCarthy
[02:33:58.747 --> 02:34:02.948]   would still be hiding under his desk like he was on January 6th.
[02:34:02.948 --> 02:34:04.186]  And Gaetz has said it's not enough.
[02:34:04.228 --> 02:34:05.088]  We don't want lip service.
[02:34:05.148 --> 02:34:09.551]  We want impeachment now to put them on trial and get them on the defense.
[02:34:10.071 --> 02:34:13.033]  Robert Barnes, VivaBarnesLaw.Locals.com.
[02:34:13.453 --> 02:34:14.454]  Just Google Robert Barnes.
[02:34:14.474 --> 02:34:15.014]  He's everywhere.
[02:34:15.394 --> 02:34:17.275]  Incredible job, Robert Barnes.
[02:34:17.295 --> 02:34:17.996]  Thank you so much.
[02:34:19.256 --> 02:34:19.937]  Glad to be here, Alex.
[02:34:20.157 --> 02:34:23.419]  Or, person number one is the federal government's calling you these days.
[02:34:23.439 --> 02:34:24.099]  That's catching.
[02:34:24.199 --> 02:34:25.620]  I like that better than Alex Jones was right.
[02:34:25.660 --> 02:34:26.881]  I'm now person one.
[02:34:28.391 --> 02:34:28.771]  Exactly.
[02:34:28.791 --> 02:34:32.352]  I mean, it's so important the federal government has to identify you as Person 1.
[02:34:32.813 --> 02:34:36.014]  That sounds to me like the most important person in America, and they're probably right.
[02:34:36.274 --> 02:34:38.014]  Well, in another case they called Trump Person 1.
[02:34:38.274 --> 02:34:38.955]  What does that mean?
[02:34:38.975 --> 02:34:40.375]  Like I'm the Don or something?
[02:34:41.396 --> 02:34:44.156]  The super secret name that cannot be mentioned.
[02:34:46.317 --> 02:34:47.138]  Oh my goodness.
[02:34:47.218 --> 02:34:48.258]  Robert, thank you so much.
[02:34:49.316 --> 02:34:50.316]  Glad to be here, Alex.
[02:34:50.316 --> 02:34:53.155]   All right, I got some other news I want to hit, and then the great Erwin Hernandez is
[02:34:53.155 --> 02:34:56.876]   going to take over, head of the great Owen Schroer, is going to be put in prison anytime,

[02:35:57.948 --> 02:35:59.169]  Folks, I don't blow smoke at you.
[02:35:59.589 --> 02:36:00.210]  It's powerful.
[02:36:00.049 --> 02:36:07.049]  Roll Red Bill Plus.
[02:36:07.049 --> 02:36:17.049]  It's just a mask.
[02:36:17.504 --> 02:36:18.585]  It's just six feet.
[02:36:19.325 --> 02:36:21.187]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[02:36:21.908 --> 02:36:23.610]  It's just non-essential workers.
[02:36:24.330 --> 02:36:26.152]  It's just until we work it out.
[02:36:26.873 --> 02:36:27.774]  It's just a bar.
[02:36:28.394 --> 02:36:29.575]  It's just a restaurant.
[02:36:30.549 --> 02:36:31.730]  It's just nursing homes.
[02:36:32.450 --> 02:36:33.551]  It's just schools.
[02:36:34.312 --> 02:36:36.913]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[02:36:37.614 --> 02:36:39.415]  It's just until the cases go down.
[02:36:40.195 --> 02:36:41.797]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[02:36:42.437 --> 02:36:44.558]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[02:36:45.259 --> 02:36:46.920]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:51.723]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[02:36:52.283 --> 02:36:53.985]  It's just churches and mosques.
[02:36:54.765 --> 02:36:55.746]  It's just singing.
[02:36:56.426 --> 02:36:58.427]  It's just travel.
[02:36:59.127 --> 02:37:00.848]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[02:37:01.588 --> 02:37:02.869]  It's just for the greater good.
[02:37:03.549 --> 02:37:04.969]  It's just fact-checking.
[02:37:05.810 --> 02:37:06.830]  Not censorship.
[02:37:07.451 --> 02:37:08.871]  It's just mandatory.
[02:37:09.451 --> 02:37:10.652]  It isn't just at all.
[02:37:11.292 --> 02:37:14.654]  Visit defendjones.com to help fight back today.
[02:37:16.114 --> 02:37:18.215]  Man, I get so prepared for this show every day.
[02:37:18.335 --> 02:37:19.356]  At night, in the morning.
[02:37:19.376 --> 02:37:22.297]  I never cover 10% of the news, but that's okay.
[02:37:23.342 --> 02:37:27.684]  I'm getting ready to get in the armored truck and go downtown and talk to the leftists that are putting their masks back on.
[02:37:28.905 --> 02:37:32.867]  And we're going to put that out at jonescrowder.com, Stephen Crowder's site.
[02:37:33.588 --> 02:37:34.528]  It's another way to support us.
[02:37:34.568 --> 02:37:40.411]  But, you know, before I come back next segment, I have a few news stories and hand the baton to the great Rivernanda.
[02:37:40.431 --> 02:37:41.312]  I just wanted to say something.
[02:37:42.190 --> 02:37:53.494]  I consider and ask listeners for support, but I've got to remember, because we can tell in the different radio stations that are out there, but also internet, the average person, if you put it all together, listens about 25 minutes live.
[02:37:53.774 --> 02:37:55.215]  And I get it, you're busy, I'm the same way.
[02:37:55.595 --> 02:37:57.896]  But some of my favorite shows, I've only got time to watch part of it.
[02:37:59.297 --> 02:38:01.878]  I like to watch Tim Pool, I like to watch what RFK Jr.
[02:38:01.898 --> 02:38:04.198]  says, but I'm probably watching 5 minutes of RFK Jr.
[02:38:04.238 --> 02:38:04.499]  a day.
[02:38:05.859 --> 02:38:07.840]  Tucker Carlson, love him to death, might watch 10 minutes a day.
[02:38:09.289 --> 02:38:14.293]  If I did like Glenn Beck and everybody did and plugged every segment, we'd probably have double the money and could radically expand.
[02:38:15.474 --> 02:38:19.857]  I plugged in the last three hours, probably three minutes.
[02:38:20.854 --> 02:38:22.915]  If I plug six minutes, we'd have double the money.
[02:38:23.535 --> 02:38:30.879]  So a lot of this is my fault because there's certain listeners tuned in certain times that do support, but then I don't promote stuff most of the time.
[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:33.141]  And people say, why do you have 14 minutes of ads an hour?
[02:38:33.181 --> 02:38:34.241]  Well, we're still on talk radio.
[02:38:34.261 --> 02:38:35.202]  We're on hundreds of stations.
[02:38:35.522 --> 02:38:36.603]  That's the talk radio model.
[02:38:36.623 --> 02:38:39.104]  But everybody knows people don't really listen to the ads much.
[02:38:40.265 --> 02:38:46.248]  So it really does come down to, I need to plug probably twice an hour, as quickly as I can.
[02:38:46.288 --> 02:38:49.590]  But things are so crazy, you see me cutting half the network ads out anyways.
[02:38:50.638 --> 02:38:52.059]  That's just the ads for the network.
[02:38:52.359 --> 02:38:55.860]  So, you know, that falls on GCN and falls on us at the end of the day.
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:59.642]  Our sponsors drop us, but, you know, not much of our support sponsors.
[02:38:59.702 --> 02:39:01.223]  It's mainly just you directly supporting us.
[02:39:01.243 --> 02:39:02.603]  So, I need your help.
[02:39:03.223 --> 02:39:04.224]  JonesCrowder.com.

[02:39:18.632 --> 02:39:19.712]  JonesCrowder.com.
[02:39:20.673 --> 02:39:28.997]  Also, you can go to InfoWarsTore.com or RealRedPill Plus, DNA Force Plus, and of course, the amazing Bodies, Lungs, and Tumor formula are back in stock.
[02:39:29.037 --> 02:39:31.399]  The big thing is Real Red Pill is back.
[02:39:32.299 --> 02:39:34.821]  You know, we had like 5,000 reviews for it, five stars.
[02:39:35.482 --> 02:39:42.468]  And then the review site, it's a third-party site we had for eight, nine years during the platforming said, we don't want your anymore.
[02:39:42.888 --> 02:39:44.490]  We don't care about all the people you have.
[02:39:44.530 --> 02:39:48.113]  We have a new review system and it's still five stars, but only 52 reviews.
[02:39:48.553 --> 02:39:49.915]  Cause it just started like six months ago.
[02:39:50.595 --> 02:39:53.096]  But, I mean, it'll blow you away what it does.
[02:39:53.256 --> 02:39:53.817]  It's amazing.
[02:39:53.837 --> 02:39:55.277]  Just your overall youth, your health.
[02:39:55.778 --> 02:39:57.379]  It's as close to the fountain of youth as you're going to get.
[02:39:57.399 --> 02:40:02.581]  It's DNA Force Plus, with a real Red Pill Plus, along with the Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:40:02.601 --> 02:40:08.084]  So, I'm just kind of realizing during the break, I'm like, wow, you just did a 45-second plug last hour.
[02:40:08.904 --> 02:40:10.045]  You didn't plug the hour before.
[02:40:10.065 --> 02:40:11.726]  You did about a three-minute plug in the first hour.
[02:40:12.206 --> 02:40:13.447]  Jones, you're really the problem.
[02:40:13.607 --> 02:40:15.888]  Because it's actually not the audience.
[02:40:15.928 --> 02:40:16.248]  It's me.
[02:40:16.969 --> 02:40:18.609]  Because the average audience has got 20-25 minutes.
[02:40:20.367 --> 02:40:23.949]  And I'm sitting here not plugging every 25 minutes.
[02:40:24.009 --> 02:40:29.011]  So, starting tomorrow, religiously, you guys need to put a shock collar on here.
[02:40:29.751 --> 02:40:33.933]  I'm serious, put a big clock in here that just flashes red every 25 minutes.
[02:40:35.202 --> 02:40:35.903]  Or every 20 minutes.
[02:40:35.983 --> 02:40:37.744]  And then I'll just, every 20 minutes, do a quick plug.
[02:40:38.324 --> 02:40:39.385]  And that solves our problems.
[02:40:39.405 --> 02:40:45.690]  Because what's happening is, I'm writing the listeners, because a big percent, you know, it's a minority, listen for hours.
[02:40:46.571 --> 02:40:48.892]  And you're having to hear me plug, you know, every once in a while.
[02:40:49.333 --> 02:40:51.174]  But the average person tunes in and hears nothing.
[02:40:51.474 --> 02:40:52.595]  They just hear me covering news.
[02:40:53.736 --> 02:40:56.418]  And again, we have fought through so much.
[02:40:56.458 --> 02:40:57.379]  We have done so much.
[02:40:57.479 --> 02:40:58.580]  It has been insane.
[02:40:59.841 --> 02:41:00.801]  They're trying to put me in jail.
[02:41:00.841 --> 02:41:01.522]  You see it everywhere.
[02:41:01.542 --> 02:41:02.783]  They're putting Owen in jail.
[02:41:05.399 --> 02:41:13.801]  I just need to plug more and get built back up to the money level where we're not sold out of half our products all the time, where we've got everything you love in there all the time.
[02:41:13.821 --> 02:41:15.362]  Because half our products are sold out right now.
[02:41:15.702 --> 02:41:17.842]  Finally, some of the stuff that's been sold out for a long time is back.
[02:41:18.463 --> 02:41:20.263]  So I'm almost stabilized, folks.
[02:41:20.343 --> 02:41:24.204]  And so I don't want to come to you and bitch or complain or act like you didn't do something.
[02:41:24.644 --> 02:41:25.565]  No, I love you.
[02:41:25.605 --> 02:41:26.485]  We've done amazing things.
[02:41:26.545 --> 02:41:29.606]  But we're really reaching peak here.
[02:41:31.006 --> 02:41:33.548]  Like a mountain range, I hope it goes up again, because I want to keep beating the enemy.
[02:41:33.568 --> 02:41:37.972]  But I'm fabulously satisfied with the success we've already had.
[02:41:38.592 --> 02:41:41.635]  But because we've had so much success together, I want to go to the next level.
[02:41:42.535 --> 02:41:47.439]  I want to... It's like that song, ooh so hot, no time to take a rest.
[02:41:47.900 --> 02:41:49.681]  There's no room for second best.
[02:41:50.401 --> 02:41:53.124]  I mean, that... Let's come in with, you got another thing coming, we can do that.
[02:41:53.744 --> 02:41:55.105]  You got another thing coming.
[02:41:55.666 --> 02:41:59.389]  We'll be right back, got a few final things to hit, and then Drew Hernandez, always in fuego.
[02:42:00.385 --> 02:42:09.213]  All right, the mighty Drew Hernandez, talk show host, investigative journalist, and pastor, is about to take over here in just a few minutes.
[02:42:10.554 --> 02:42:12.396]  But I want the enemies of freedom to know something.
[02:42:13.056 --> 02:42:15.578]  If they think we'll give up our fortune, our birthright, that's liberty.
[02:42:16.399 --> 02:42:17.260]  They got another thing coming.
[02:42:18.737 --> 02:42:19.918]  And that's what this comes down to.
[02:42:20.518 --> 02:42:21.879]  And again, they're going to try.
[02:42:21.919 --> 02:42:23.920]  They're not all powerful, like the governor of New Mexico.
[02:42:23.940 --> 02:42:25.000]  We're going to ban your guns.
[02:42:25.581 --> 02:42:26.401]  People said no.
[02:42:26.461 --> 02:42:27.122]  They backed off.
[02:42:27.162 --> 02:42:29.063]  The sheriff said, whoa, this is unconstitutional.
[02:42:29.463 --> 02:42:30.544]  We're about to have a war on our hands.
[02:42:30.624 --> 02:42:31.924]  We don't want to kill sheriff's deputies.
[02:42:31.944 --> 02:42:32.325]  We're not.
[02:42:32.765 --> 02:42:34.005]  We don't want to kill FBI agents.
[02:42:34.025 --> 02:42:34.426]  We're not.
[02:42:35.066 --> 02:42:41.590]  But if you have criminal leaders that start a war with the people, they're a bunch of people that are sick of it and are ready to die.
[02:42:42.010 --> 02:42:42.690]  I don't want that.
[02:42:42.990 --> 02:42:44.371]  I don't want Biden to get assassinated.
[02:42:44.611 --> 02:42:45.412]  That'll help the enemy.
[02:42:45.472 --> 02:42:47.173]  We're winning politically.
[02:42:47.898 --> 02:42:49.459]  We're winning culturally.
[02:42:50.340 --> 02:42:57.345]  There's another, you know, song I was thinking of that's got a no one to hold him, no one to fold him, no one to walk away, no one to run.
[02:42:57.806 --> 02:43:02.889]  The great Kenny Rogers and The Gambler.
[02:43:03.630 --> 02:43:06.732]  The globalists know that they're losing.
[02:43:08.093 --> 02:43:10.015]  And they are in full panic mode.
[02:43:10.035 --> 02:43:12.417]  So we are in such a dangerous situation.
[02:43:12.437 --> 02:43:13.638]  And I know you know that.
[02:43:14.642 --> 02:43:18.924]  But just have faith in God and know that the Great Awakening is here.
[02:43:19.705 --> 02:43:22.066]  So, political prisoner, he's now officially that.
[02:43:22.306 --> 02:43:24.568]  They're putting him in jail soon, they said as early as next week.
[02:43:25.328 --> 02:43:30.211]  Owen Schroyer takes over in 53 minutes from now with the war room.
[02:43:31.352 --> 02:43:33.453]  The great Derrick Hernandez is about to take over.
[02:43:33.873 --> 02:43:37.515]  But here's the deal, the knives are out, not by us, but by the deep state.
[02:43:37.575 --> 02:43:38.596]  They want Biden gone.
[02:43:38.656 --> 02:43:41.838]  Politico, CNN, Biden Inc., Biden crime family.
[02:43:42.751 --> 02:43:43.532]  Steve Bannon's right.
[02:43:43.712 --> 02:43:44.913]  They're getting ready to get rid of him.
[02:43:45.434 --> 02:43:49.317]  It's gonna be... I think Newsom, he's already pre-programmed.
[02:43:49.677 --> 02:43:50.598]  He's denied he's gonna do it.
[02:43:50.618 --> 02:43:51.319]  That means he is.
[02:43:52.019 --> 02:43:53.241]  I think Roger Stone's wrong.
[02:43:53.301 --> 02:43:54.101]  He's rarely wrong.
[02:43:54.462 --> 02:43:55.523]  He thinks it's Big Mike.
[02:43:56.664 --> 02:44:00.667]  But regardless, we are about to see incredible times.
[02:44:02.089 --> 02:44:14.422]   And if they run Long Dong Silver, also known as Big Mike, aka Michelle McDaddy Obama, It's a black man that Michelle runs.
[02:44:15.202 --> 02:44:17.364]  Mike, Big Mike, that's where you get that.
[02:44:17.424 --> 02:44:22.508]  Oh, Mike, my husband Mike, he said two speeches with Big Mike there, rubbing her nose at him.
[02:44:23.029 --> 02:44:25.511]  And I don't hate Big Mike that he's a man, that he thinks he's a woman.
[02:44:25.951 --> 02:44:26.872]  It's that he's a globalist.
[02:44:27.733 --> 02:44:32.997]  If they run Big Mike, see, they can push the race initiative and say, oh, you're against a black woman.
[02:44:34.379 --> 02:44:35.800]  No, I'm not against black women.
[02:44:35.860 --> 02:44:36.981]  In fact, I love everybody.
[02:44:38.482 --> 02:44:39.202]  Everybody equally.
[02:44:39.302 --> 02:44:48.065]  But I, as a white person, am not going to be intimidated from criticizing Big Mike just because he's a black man.
[02:44:48.946 --> 02:44:53.547]  I don't care if you're a white man, Hispanic man, Asian man, white man.
[02:44:54.588 --> 02:45:04.251]  If you are running for office as a man, who's a woman, who's a man, then you are fair game, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:45:05.475 --> 02:45:07.216]  And that's what this comes down to, and that's where we are.
[02:45:07.476 --> 02:45:11.059]  But there is some good news, and I'm going to play this clip and then go to Drew Hernandez.
[02:45:11.559 --> 02:45:17.102]  Mitt Romney is quitting the Republican Party and hanging up his spurs.
[02:45:18.003 --> 02:45:19.864]  He got Trump to support him for the Senate.
[02:45:20.905 --> 02:45:22.426]  He was in political wash-up.
[02:45:23.206 --> 02:45:26.108]  He pledged allegiance to the Trump agenda of Make America First.
[02:45:26.708 --> 02:45:32.052]  And immediately, one day after being elected, has been stabbing Trump in the back for five years.
[02:45:33.174 --> 02:45:37.577]  And so, he slipped up, though, in his farewell address.
[02:45:39.378 --> 02:45:41.619]  He'll still be lingering around for a while, but a joke.
[02:45:42.499 --> 02:45:53.266]  He slipped up in his Bushian moment and said that Trump is the majority, we are the rhino minority, and just admitted that they're not who we want.
[02:45:53.986 --> 02:45:58.469]  Here is EddieMonster2.0.
[02:46:00.930 --> 02:46:13.634]  Well, there's no question, but the Republican Party today is in the shadow of Donald Trump.
[02:46:14.054 --> 02:46:17.275]  He is the leader of the greatest portion of the Republican Party.
[02:46:17.935 --> 02:46:20.615]  It's a populist, I believe, demagogue portion of the party.
[02:46:21.336 --> 02:46:23.216]  Look, I represent a small wing of the party.
[02:46:23.276 --> 02:46:25.917]  If you will, I call it the wise wing of the Republican Party.
[02:46:27.058 --> 02:46:28.719]  And I don't believe we're going away.
[02:46:28.799 --> 02:46:33.483]  I think ultimately we'll see a resurgence and come back into leadership of the party.
[02:46:33.903 --> 02:46:40.129]  Look, my wing of the party talks about policy and about issues that will make a difference to the lives of the American people.
[02:46:40.729 --> 02:46:49.617]  The Trump wing of the party talks about resentments of various kind and getting even and settling scores and revisiting the 2020 election.
[02:46:50.177 --> 02:46:51.679]  What are the policies for the future?
[02:46:52.299 --> 02:46:57.644]  And my party is only going to be successful getting young people to vote for us if we're talking about the future.
[02:46:58.084 --> 02:47:00.106]  And that's not happening so far in that other way.
[02:47:00.206 --> 02:47:03.189]  Are you going to lose that battle?
[02:47:03.369 --> 02:47:08.694]  Are you fighting that wing of the party and stepping aside?
[02:47:09.555 --> 02:47:15.880]  So they're retiring the old Patrick Bateman, American Psycho, and they're bringing us the new one.
[02:47:16.857 --> 02:47:17.718]  Gavin Newsom.
[02:47:18.458 --> 02:47:21.220]  Alright, I'm gonna go ahead and go out with this before I hand the baton.
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:22.320]  We'll skip this break for more time.
[02:47:22.681 --> 02:47:23.861]  The great Drew Hernandez.
[02:47:24.442 --> 02:47:29.685]  This is my message to the left, the globalists, the New World Order, the Rothschilds, and the whole shootin' match.
[02:47:31.006 --> 02:47:32.406]  It's one life!
[02:47:33.387 --> 02:47:37.770]  And I'm gonna live it to the fullest, fightin' globalist tyrants!
[02:47:38.330 --> 02:47:39.371]  Woo!
[02:47:41.072 --> 02:47:44.594]  It's not been fun getting attacked by tyrants, but man, has it boosted us.
[02:47:45.231 --> 02:47:46.331]  Alex Jones is right.
[02:47:46.891 --> 02:47:48.072]  Person number one.
[02:47:48.192 --> 02:47:51.152]  Now, adjectives in the culture!
[02:47:51.172 --> 02:48:01.394]  You're thinking like a fool, because all it takes is you and I. Out there isn't a... ready to be had.
[02:48:04.294 --> 02:48:06.355]  Out there is a fortune just ready to be had.
[02:48:06.395 --> 02:48:07.635]  The fortune ain't a bunch of money.
[02:48:08.255 --> 02:48:09.515]  The fortune is the truth.
[02:48:10.656 --> 02:48:12.936]  And being close to God and being engaged.
[02:48:14.255 --> 02:48:18.943]  If you think I'll sit around, you got another thing coming.
[02:48:19.543 --> 02:48:22.027]  I don't know how to quit, and neither do you as an audience of activists.
[02:48:22.588 --> 02:48:25.092]  Now, the great Drew Hernandez takes over.
[02:48:25.192 --> 02:48:25.974]  Drew Hernandez!
[02:48:27.583 --> 02:48:29.565]  Alex Jones, thank you for having me, sir.
[02:48:29.625 --> 02:48:32.327]  It is an honor to continue to host the show here on The Fourth Hour.
[02:48:32.347 --> 02:48:34.269]  I'm your guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[02:48:34.289 --> 02:48:38.052]  Good to see all the Info Warriors worldwide tuning in right now.
[02:48:38.092 --> 02:48:39.193]  Make sure to share those links.
[02:48:39.573 --> 02:48:43.356]  Go check out InfoWarsTore.com, Band.Video, support the broadcast.
[02:48:43.677 --> 02:48:44.397]  It is imperative.
[02:48:44.758 --> 02:48:46.779]  Imagine a world without Alex Jones.
[02:48:48.180 --> 02:48:52.024]  Imagine the past 50 years without InfoWars.
[02:48:52.824 --> 02:48:54.005]  No Bohemian Grove.
[02:48:54.826 --> 02:48:55.146]  No 9-11 truth.
[02:48:57.133 --> 02:48:58.613]  No endgame documentary.
[02:48:58.633 --> 02:49:01.354]  No exposure of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:49:02.134 --> 02:49:03.915]  No exposure of the New World Order.
[02:49:03.935 --> 02:49:06.575]  No serious breach of the Matrix.
[02:49:06.855 --> 02:49:13.997]  Imagine a world without Alex, InfoWars, Owen Schroyer, American Journal, Harrison Smith.
[02:49:14.057 --> 02:49:17.838]  Imagine a world without this information and this intel.
[02:49:18.498 --> 02:49:20.799]  This is what the globalists think every single day.
[02:49:20.859 --> 02:49:29.821]   Imagine a world without the InfoWars army, the InfoWars crew, Imagine a world without every single one of us that are breaching this matrix every single day.
[02:49:29.841 --> 02:49:33.762]  It is the globalist utopia that they want perfectly installed.
[02:49:34.363 --> 02:49:36.424]  Imagine a world without any of this intel.
[02:49:36.444 --> 02:49:43.647]  Imagine a world without any of these broadcasts or these transmissions that are unlocking the minds of millions of people a day.
[02:49:44.087 --> 02:49:46.488]  Ultimate red pills getting launched all over the place.
[02:49:47.568 --> 02:49:48.909]  Imagine a world without that.
[02:49:48.949 --> 02:49:49.689]  Where would we be?
[02:49:50.229 --> 02:49:51.770]  Ultimate tyranny in the dark?
[02:49:52.637 --> 02:50:00.565]  Not clearly understanding fundamentally what's really going on with a lot of serious subjects and events that are taking place worldwide?
[02:50:00.585 --> 02:50:04.930]  A world without Alex Jones and InfoWars is cucked out Fox News!
[02:50:06.896 --> 02:50:11.639]  A world without Infowars and Alex Jones is cucked out, cuckin' in CNN.
[02:50:12.199 --> 02:50:16.362]  State approved propaganda, which by the way, did you guys see what happened the other day?
[02:50:16.382 --> 02:50:27.749]  It's getting leaked that the Biden administration is influencing, is pressing CNN, pressing Fox News to crack down a little harder on the impeachment inquiry against Kevin McCarthy.
[02:50:28.010 --> 02:50:29.851]  Of course the Biden administration is going to do that.
[02:50:30.271 --> 02:50:35.612]  Because we are dealing with CCP-level, North Korea-level type tyranny here in the United States of America.
[02:50:35.932 --> 02:50:37.293]  The media is not real.
[02:50:38.513 --> 02:50:40.333]  The media is not authentic.
[02:50:41.353 --> 02:50:45.294]  The media only serves one purpose right now in the United States of America.
[02:50:45.314 --> 02:50:47.755]  And that's to control your mind.
[02:50:47.775 --> 02:50:49.535]  It's not even to push a narrative.
[02:50:49.775 --> 02:50:51.716]  It's to control your mind.
[02:50:52.696 --> 02:50:55.917]  And as a result, they know that that will control your behavior.
[02:50:56.117 --> 02:51:08.622]   Whether they pump fear down your mind, Whether they pump their authoritative narrative down your mind, whether it's disinformation, misinformation, whatever it is, it's designed to control you.
[02:51:09.022 --> 02:51:22.829]  Whether they go with the COVID fear porn, the climate lockdown fear porn, or they go with the lockouts of the economy with the global world dollar digital currency economic system that is on the horizon.
[02:51:22.889 --> 02:51:23.609]  It's here.
[02:51:23.709 --> 02:51:25.270]  The infrastructure exists.
[02:51:25.950 --> 02:51:31.170]   No matter what they go with, The threat of a new nuclear war and they blame it on Putin.
[02:51:31.430 --> 02:51:36.211]  Whatever it is, it's all designed to control your mind, to control your behavior.
[02:51:36.251 --> 02:51:50.135]  Why do you think you got Noah Yuval Harari just so obsessed and wet on the verge of ejaculating at the fact that we have technology that exists today.
[02:51:50.155 --> 02:51:56.557]  Neuralink VRAR that could bypass the conscience of the human mind.
[02:51:57.358 --> 02:51:58.359]  Because that gives them what?
[02:51:58.399 --> 02:51:59.299]  It gives them control.
[02:51:59.359 --> 02:52:02.361]  It gives them power over your behavior, ultimately.
[02:52:02.381 --> 02:52:20.211]  You see, these people, the whole end game of controlling one's mind through the information war is to ultimately control the individual as a puppet, as a cyborg programmed from the back end type of embodied shell.
[02:52:20.231 --> 02:52:23.213]  This is why they're going with the Joe Bidens.
[02:52:24.341 --> 02:52:29.845]  I think Robert Barnes, the last interview between Alex and Robert, just stated it perfectly.
[02:52:29.865 --> 02:52:32.447]  It's like this mixture of incompetence.
[02:52:33.334 --> 02:52:38.537]  With serious evil, lack of a conscience, and they are controllable.
[02:52:38.977 --> 02:52:42.759]  You see, when you have that kind of mixture, that's why you're getting a Joe Biden installed.
[02:52:42.779 --> 02:52:45.041]  That's why you're getting a Kamala Harris installed.
[02:52:45.401 --> 02:52:48.162]  That's why you're getting a John Fetterman installed.
[02:52:48.603 --> 02:52:56.107]  That's why you have Fannie Willis or whatever the hell her name is in Georgia getting installed with a bunch of incompetent retards.
[02:52:56.949 --> 02:53:04.957]  That are easy manipulated and they'll do the evil bidding of those at the top and the elites that are pulling the puppet strings at the bottom.
[02:53:05.157 --> 02:53:06.598]  Doesn't mean that they're not accountable.
[02:53:06.618 --> 02:53:09.281]  Doesn't mean that they're not a threat because they ultimately are.
[02:53:09.321 --> 02:53:10.762]  That's why they're so dangerous.
[02:53:11.543 --> 02:53:12.384]  They're retarded.
[02:53:12.824 --> 02:53:14.245]  They can't think for themselves.
[02:53:15.366 --> 02:53:16.468]  They're void of an IQ.
[02:53:17.580 --> 02:53:33.172]  The only thing they could calculate is, Well my boss told me I need to do this, cause Orange Man and Alex Jones bad, Infowars bad because I was told so, so if I want to gain a promotion in the New World Order, I need to do what I am told!
[02:53:34.012 --> 02:53:35.573]  Freakin' DDD!
[02:53:36.334 --> 02:53:49.818]   It's a combination of that, and a combination of, these people are emotionally driven, compromised, internally, So that combination together is a lethal weapon that's going to go after anybody.
[02:53:50.798 --> 02:53:52.558]  I mean, that's what Defund the Police was.
[02:53:52.899 --> 02:53:54.759]  It was a regime installation.
[02:53:54.819 --> 02:53:56.140]  They get rid of all the good guys.
[02:53:56.800 --> 02:53:58.120]  Get rid of anyone with a conscience.
[02:53:58.620 --> 02:53:59.461]  Purge them all!
[02:54:00.341 --> 02:54:01.821]  Purge them all out of the military.
[02:54:02.082 --> 02:54:03.822]  Purge them all out of the police departments.
[02:54:04.962 --> 02:54:07.103]  Purge them all out of the FBI, the CIA.
[02:54:07.443 --> 02:54:09.364]  Purge anyone with a conscience.
[02:54:09.784 --> 02:54:14.052]   Because you can't have anyone, including the media, By Tucker Carlson!
[02:54:14.292 --> 02:54:16.094]  Purge Tucker Carlson out of Fox News!
[02:54:16.294 --> 02:54:17.375]  He's getting too close!
[02:54:18.716 --> 02:54:20.998]  He's getting too close to the truth about J6!
[02:54:21.298 --> 02:54:22.959]  He's getting way too close!
[02:54:23.280 --> 02:54:24.681]  Purge him immediately!
[02:54:24.701 --> 02:54:26.342]  And what does Robert Murdoch do?
[02:54:26.382 --> 02:54:27.583]  DC was calling for that!
[02:54:28.444 --> 02:54:29.665]  Chuck Schumer was calling for that!
[02:54:29.986 --> 02:54:31.046]  The Hill was calling for that!
[02:54:31.107 --> 02:54:31.527]  The Senate!
[02:54:32.259 --> 02:54:34.139]  All the deep state pawns on both sides?
[02:54:34.560 --> 02:54:35.580]  Purge Tucker Carlson!
[02:54:35.740 --> 02:54:36.480]  Take him off the air!
[02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:38.260]  He's spreading lies and disinformation!
[02:54:38.481 --> 02:54:40.141]  It's gonna lead to another J6!
[02:54:40.441 --> 02:54:43.402]  It's gonna lead to another domestic right-wing terror attack!
[02:54:43.742 --> 02:54:44.642]  It must be stopped!
[02:54:45.702 --> 02:54:46.723]  Unauthorized speech.
[02:54:47.303 --> 02:54:48.463]  Same thing with Owen Schroer.
[02:54:49.603 --> 02:54:50.964]  Same exact thing.
[02:54:52.484 --> 02:54:57.685]  And by doing so, they remove anyone with a conscience, and by doing so, they remove anyone.
[02:54:57.785 --> 02:55:00.846]  It doesn't matter what political party you subscribe to.
[02:55:02.265 --> 02:55:06.186]  I think the two-party system is part of the simulation.
[02:55:06.206 --> 02:55:07.587]  I think it's part of the matrix.
[02:55:08.127 --> 02:55:10.468]  The two-party system is a matrix program.
[02:55:10.488 --> 02:55:11.648]  It's what it is.
[02:55:12.628 --> 02:55:18.670]  It's an uploaded matrix program to give you a perception of something that's real and authentic in this great country.
[02:55:18.690 --> 02:55:20.991]  You mean to tell me that we can't go beyond?
[02:55:22.191 --> 02:55:26.673]  We're hundreds of years into this thing and we can't go beyond Democrat and Republican?
[02:55:27.393 --> 02:55:28.753]  That's what MAGA is.
[02:55:28.813 --> 02:55:30.874]  That's what the Great Awakening is.
[02:55:32.310 --> 02:55:36.753]  Obviously Christ is king and supreme over anything and anybody in the universe.
[02:55:37.313 --> 02:55:40.755]  But you mean to tell me that we can't go beyond two selections?
[02:55:41.696 --> 02:55:51.662]  Of course, we have the super PACs, we have all the major billionaire globalist donors that keep that simulation program afloat because they only donate to two sides.
[02:55:52.322 --> 02:55:57.786]  But in reality, they're all working together and they get what they want politically and legislatively.
[02:55:58.542 --> 02:55:59.963]  And what do they call it in D.C.?
[02:56:00.363 --> 02:56:01.904]  Reaching across the aisle.
[02:56:02.024 --> 02:56:04.305]  Have you fell for that psy-op at some point in your life?
[02:56:04.586 --> 02:56:09.509]  Well, we're gonna reach across the aisle to, wink-wink, work for the American people.
[02:56:09.549 --> 02:56:15.972]  They don't give a damn about you, about your family, about your success and your future.
[02:56:15.992 --> 02:56:18.954]  It's like a handful of people in D.C.
[02:56:18.974 --> 02:56:20.255]  that actually do.
[02:56:20.975 --> 02:56:24.137]  And when they actually gain some ground, what happens to people like that?
[02:56:24.397 --> 02:56:25.178]  They get destroyed.
[02:56:25.198 --> 02:56:26.779]  They get cancelled.
[02:56:27.759 --> 02:56:33.221]  They get blackmailed, or somehow compromised and removed from their post.
[02:56:33.681 --> 02:56:35.181]  Someone that's truly America First.
[02:56:35.641 --> 02:56:38.062]  Someone that is truly anti-globalism.
[02:56:38.502 --> 02:56:40.743]  Someone that is truly anti-Big Pharma.
[02:56:41.223 --> 02:56:43.523]  Someone that is truly anti-establishment.
[02:56:44.684 --> 02:56:45.344]  They get destroyed.
[02:56:45.364 --> 02:56:46.364]  You get Donald Trumped!
[02:56:47.485 --> 02:56:52.086]  You get Donald Trumped, you get Alex Jonesed, you get Owen Schroedered, you get InfoWarsed.
[02:56:53.064 --> 02:56:55.046]  You get censored, obliterated.
[02:56:55.446 --> 02:56:58.068]  You're not allowed to have a voice in the regime.
[02:56:58.508 --> 02:56:59.509]  Look at North Korea.
[02:56:59.909 --> 02:57:01.430]  What happened to revolutionaries there?
[02:57:01.450 --> 02:57:02.911]  You probably never even heard of one!
[02:57:04.092 --> 02:57:05.113]  Look at the CCP.
[02:57:05.133 --> 02:57:06.674]  What happens to revolutionaries there?
[02:57:08.464 --> 02:57:09.184]  They disappear!
[02:57:09.204 --> 02:57:17.446]  Any totalitarian regime, there is no room or authorization for free speech.
[02:57:17.846 --> 02:57:19.026]  Freedom of thought, dude.
[02:57:19.327 --> 02:57:20.687]  That's how far these people go.
[02:57:20.947 --> 02:57:27.308]  And right now, where we are in this part of the timeline, they're going beyond censoring speech.
[02:57:28.189 --> 02:57:29.909]  We're straight 1984, baby.
[02:57:30.529 --> 02:57:32.490]  Unauthorized thoughts, wrong think.
[02:57:33.190 --> 02:57:34.790]  They're gonna want to look into your mind.
[02:57:35.630 --> 02:57:43.366]   You don't think they're gonna take technology like Neuralink And weaponize it against not only the American people, but the population of mankind?
[02:57:43.546 --> 02:57:44.687]  You don't think that's going to happen?
[02:57:44.847 --> 02:57:45.887]  Look what they did with Apple!
[02:57:47.128 --> 02:57:48.529]  Look what they've done with Apple!
[02:57:49.610 --> 02:57:54.492]  Now, I don't know if this was Steve Jobs' intention for Apple to be where it is today.
[02:57:54.513 --> 02:57:57.774]  I don't know if this is his original idea.
[02:57:57.815 --> 02:58:04.318]  I mean, the way Steve Jobs was from the very beginning, he seemed to want to give control to the user and, you know, give the government the finger.
[02:58:04.338 --> 02:58:15.199]   A lot of his early days 19, you know, very early days, advertisements were like super like 1984 Orwellian anti-government type.
[02:58:16.299 --> 02:58:18.960]  And, you know, I'm not sure.
[02:58:18.980 --> 02:58:30.066]  I'm not sure if Steve Jobs foresaw a future where the media, like Alex Jones, that are anti-New World Order, anti-serious government overreach.
[02:58:30.286 --> 02:58:36.028]  I don't know if Steve Jobs foresaw a future where that would be censored on his platform.
[02:58:36.869 --> 02:58:37.149]  I don't know.
[02:58:38.129 --> 02:58:38.689]  I'm not sure.
[02:58:39.030 --> 02:58:43.512]  But what I do know is, take a look at what's happened, I mean, particularly with Elon Musk.
[02:58:43.892 --> 02:58:48.014]  The fact of the matter is that Apple has been 100% weaponized against humanity.
[02:58:48.675 --> 02:58:48.995]  Okay?
[02:58:49.855 --> 02:59:01.722]  A technological advancement, stride towards the future, an entire machine, a monolith, okay, has become weaponized against humanity.
[02:59:02.102 --> 02:59:03.823]  They're pushing the climate change death cult.
[02:59:04.083 --> 02:59:07.505]  They got this gigantic obese fat black woman playing Mother Nature.
[02:59:08.354 --> 02:59:16.503]  It's so cringe just lecturing Tim Cook because he's the white he's the white male with blue eyes Got this fat obese black woman.
[02:59:16.523 --> 02:59:20.448]  Just lecturing all the white people at Apple HQ in Silicon Valley.
[02:59:20.488 --> 02:59:33.024]   That's so cringe I don't think I saw the video but they openly come out they openly come out okay, one of the You know, they come out and say, well, it is Apple's goal.
[02:59:33.084 --> 02:59:38.585]  It is Apple's goal to remove carbon from the atmosphere in the next 20 to 50 years.
[02:59:39.146 --> 02:59:40.306]  I think we have that clip, guys.
[02:59:40.346 --> 02:59:41.026]  Do we have that clip?
[02:59:41.046 --> 02:59:41.986]  Can we play that real quick?
[02:59:43.367 --> 02:59:44.187]  This is where Apple is.
[02:59:44.207 --> 02:59:44.987]  Grasslands in Kenya.
[02:59:45.287 --> 02:59:45.547]  Why?
[02:59:46.127 --> 02:59:49.808]  Our aim is to permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere.
[02:59:52.669 --> 02:59:53.770]  What about your water usage?
[02:59:53.810 --> 02:59:55.250]  We've reduced it by how much?
[02:59:55.270 --> 02:59:56.250]  63 billion gallons.
[02:59:56.270 --> 02:59:56.590]  63 million?
[02:59:56.630 --> 02:59:56.930]  Billion.
[03:00:00.819 --> 03:00:01.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:00:01.940 --> 03:00:05.483]  Apple Tout's commitment to Mother Nature in cringe climate change ad.
[03:00:06.043 --> 03:00:07.904]  And guess who plays Mother Nature?
[03:00:08.825 --> 03:00:10.606]  A fat, obese, black woman.
[03:00:10.686 --> 03:00:11.667]  Could you have guessed that?
[03:00:13.689 --> 03:00:15.250]  You're all gonna be ruled!
[03:00:15.910 --> 03:00:18.212]  Black supremacy, that's the push, right?
[03:00:18.652 --> 03:00:22.695]  You're all gonna be ruled in the New World Order by fat, obese, black woman.
[03:00:22.715 --> 03:00:24.236]  All right?
[03:00:24.276 --> 03:00:25.557]  That's who your god is.
[03:00:25.637 --> 03:00:27.399]  Mother Nature, that's who your god is.
[03:00:29.625 --> 03:00:32.246]  But the point is, I don't know if Apple foresaw this.
[03:00:32.707 --> 03:00:32.987]  Maybe.
[03:00:34.027 --> 03:00:34.247]  Maybe.
[03:00:34.267 --> 03:00:36.709]  I don't know if Steve Jobs foresaw this in the future.
[03:00:36.729 --> 03:00:48.935]  A world where your advancements in technology, hardware, not so much software, but mainly hardware, would be used and weaponized against humanity.
[03:00:48.955 --> 03:00:52.117]  I mean, that seems to kind of be the reoccurring theme.
[03:00:52.737 --> 03:00:56.199]  I mean, the Nazis were revolutionary with radio technology.
[03:00:57.398 --> 03:01:18.114]  They essentially took the most advanced piece of radio technology of their day and they made home units and they distributed it to millions of Germans at that time so they could hear the voice of the Fuhrer at any moment at any time replaying speeches every single day in that regime.
[03:01:18.815 --> 03:01:28.820]   And that was seen as a serious technological advancement Innovation at the time used for political purposes and used for a tyrannical purpose.
[03:01:29.560 --> 03:01:31.461]  We all know how the story ends and goes.
[03:01:32.382 --> 03:01:35.604]  So to think that can't happen again with the technologies of today.
[03:01:35.644 --> 03:01:41.889]  I mean, why does Klaus Schwab openly say Davos 2023, World Government Summit 2023?
[03:01:42.229 --> 03:01:49.754]  Why does Klaus Schwab openly come out and say those who master the technologies of today or the future, they become masters of the future?
[03:01:51.213 --> 03:01:56.957]  Uh, cause the, uh, cause the old, uh, you know, he's got some, uh, Nazi collaboration in his family history.
[03:01:56.977 --> 03:01:58.698]  So he, he understands the playbook.
[03:01:58.739 --> 03:01:59.479]  It's in his blood!
[03:01:59.499 --> 03:02:05.683]  It's in his spiritual DNA to be a tyrant and manipulate technology to do so against humanity.
[03:02:05.904 --> 03:02:06.804]  He understands.
[03:02:07.305 --> 03:02:08.265]  They know what this means.
[03:02:09.886 --> 03:02:14.229]  And they want to go further than the suppression of speech.
[03:02:14.249 --> 03:02:14.870]  1984, wrong think.
[03:02:15.450 --> 03:02:17.612]  They're going to go further and beyond.
[03:02:18.773 --> 03:02:20.274]  Why just stop the speech?
[03:02:21.127 --> 03:02:22.808]  Why don't we just program the minds?
[03:02:23.128 --> 03:02:24.448]  The technology exists.
[03:02:25.008 --> 03:02:26.809]  We don't have to use hypnotism anymore.
[03:02:26.829 --> 03:02:29.490]  We don't have to seek magicians.
[03:02:30.891 --> 03:02:33.872]  We don't have to seek some kind of supernatural means of doing this.
[03:02:34.853 --> 03:02:41.096]  Which you've seen tyrannical leaders do and regimes and false religions and idolatrous regimes of the past.
[03:02:41.116 --> 03:02:44.678]  You've seen that attempted and in some cases accomplished.
[03:02:44.698 --> 03:02:51.562]  No, now you have pieces of technology that could invade your mind and they will download what you will believe.
[03:02:52.162 --> 03:02:55.384]  They will upload what you will say, what you can see.
[03:02:55.404 --> 03:02:59.706]  It'll be an algorithm directly tied to your brain and your conscience.
[03:03:00.186 --> 03:03:03.628]  Just like Elon Musk described to Joe Rogan, a bandwidth in your brain.
[03:03:04.383 --> 03:03:05.423]  Goes back and forth.
[03:03:06.004 --> 03:03:07.064]  Goes back and forth.
[03:03:07.744 --> 03:03:12.906]  Like an internet connection, a LAN, an L-A-N, or a WAN, a W-A-N connection, an Ethernet connection.
[03:03:13.306 --> 03:03:13.726]  Wired.
[03:03:14.267 --> 03:03:15.147]  Straight into the internet.
[03:03:15.187 --> 03:03:15.927]  Back and forth.
[03:03:16.327 --> 03:03:17.408]  And who's gonna control that?
[03:03:17.448 --> 03:03:17.928]  The internet?
[03:03:18.208 --> 03:03:19.288]  Is it gonna be the Patriots?
[03:03:19.849 --> 03:03:22.610]  I'll give you one guess who it'll end up being.
[03:03:22.830 --> 03:03:26.051]  The same damn people that control big tech today.
[03:03:26.651 --> 03:03:30.919]  The same damn people that want to centralize and regulate the internet itself.
[03:03:31.280 --> 03:03:34.425]  Yeah, those will be the ones at the top controlling your mind.
[03:03:34.926 --> 03:03:37.410]  We got a lot more when we come back from the break, so stay with us.
[03:03:37.631 --> 03:03:39.154]  Infowars.com, Infowars.com.
[03:03:40.506 --> 03:03:42.387]  All righty, all righty, we are back.
[03:03:42.787 --> 03:03:48.328]  InfoWarriors, band.video, InfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:03:48.868 --> 03:03:50.529]  I'm your guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[03:03:50.569 --> 03:03:58.851]  You are now watching the fourth hour of the most banned show and transmission in the universe, the Alex Jones Show, for obvious reasons.
[03:03:59.531 --> 03:04:00.971]  Let's continue to talk about this.
[03:04:01.291 --> 03:04:04.472]  I mean, you take a look at what happened in New Mexico.
[03:04:04.932 --> 03:04:15.139]   I think that's a perfect example of the playbook That's going to continue to roll out as we continue further and further and further and further into the future.
[03:04:15.159 --> 03:04:17.421]  It is a good thing to see a resistance.
[03:04:17.601 --> 03:04:28.872]  There was a huge resistance to the tyrannical government in New Mexico mandating anti-2A, anti-2A policy, legislation, whatever you want to call it.
[03:04:28.912 --> 03:04:29.833]  It's anti-American.
[03:04:29.853 --> 03:04:34.097]  Of course, even the sheriff comes out and says, yeah, this is going a little way too far.
[03:04:34.837 --> 03:04:36.018]  But what was her reasoning?
[03:04:36.078 --> 03:04:46.465]  Her reasoning was, well, we're experiencing a public health emergency because people are getting shot so we have to ban all the guns to make sure that we can minimize how many guns are out there so whoever has guns left are the bad guys.
[03:04:46.625 --> 03:04:47.766]  So that's who we're gonna go after.
[03:04:49.327 --> 03:05:01.435]  So, if you take a look at her logic, the bad guys are gonna be you and I that hold on to our 2A because we say, yeah, F you to a tyrant trying to take away the 2A.
[03:05:02.856 --> 03:05:04.398]  That is the American response!
[03:05:04.818 --> 03:05:06.600]  Because we have God-given inalienable rights.
[03:05:06.640 --> 03:05:07.301]  We know this!
[03:05:09.183 --> 03:05:14.990]  And there were protests, peaceful protests, called within hours the next day.
[03:05:15.010 --> 03:05:16.531]  It's a good sign, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:05:17.212 --> 03:05:17.853]  You want to know why?
[03:05:17.893 --> 03:05:20.936]  Because they want you to believe that that's not happening in America.
[03:05:20.956 --> 03:05:43.237]   They want you to believe that you live in a majority Where everyone wants to get rid of the guns, they want you to believe that you live in a majority where everyone wants to do away with the two-way and accept the false premise that because we're experiencing a public health emergency, that that's a reason to throw away your God-given rights.
[03:05:43.257 --> 03:05:44.098]  Do you see the theme there?
[03:05:44.118 --> 03:05:44.758]  You see the theme?
[03:05:45.519 --> 03:05:49.222]  You see how they constantly use that same play?
[03:05:50.106 --> 03:05:51.027]  They got the playbook.
[03:05:51.047 --> 03:05:52.068]  They're calling the plays.
[03:05:52.849 --> 03:05:55.071]  Every now and then, there's a different play caller.
[03:05:55.091 --> 03:05:57.813]  They got a different quarterback throwing that, you know.
[03:05:57.853 --> 03:05:59.895]  They got a different coach going in there.
[03:05:59.935 --> 03:06:01.857]  They got a different assistant coach.
[03:06:02.238 --> 03:06:03.899]  They got an offense coach.
[03:06:03.919 --> 03:06:04.720]  They got a defense.
[03:06:04.740 --> 03:06:07.883]  They're going back and forth, calling different plays to the New World Order.
[03:06:08.243 --> 03:06:12.888]  But ultimately, the executives at the top, they know exactly what their orders are.
[03:06:15.413 --> 03:06:19.858]  But this particular situation I think was interesting because you see that common thread.
[03:06:19.878 --> 03:06:21.360]  They did the same thing with COVID.
[03:06:22.441 --> 03:06:25.324]  They're going to do the same thing with the climate change lockdowns.
[03:06:26.245 --> 03:06:35.496]  They're going to do the same thing with the New World Order, one world economic digital dollar cashless system lockouts.
[03:06:36.567 --> 03:06:46.132]  They'll lock you out of your economy, they'll lock you out of your checking and banking accounts, if you have unauthorized minds, wrong think, or hate speech.
[03:06:47.273 --> 03:06:54.436]  The play now, moving forward, is anything they want to do, without using total force, they'll get to that point eventually.
[03:06:55.177 --> 03:06:59.039]  But I think they are identifying that there are still millions of people they got to deal with.
[03:06:59.379 --> 03:07:08.334]   There are still millions of people that will not Bow, that will not surrender, that will not capitulate, which is always going to be the case.
[03:07:08.894 --> 03:07:12.376]  At some point, they will have to result to violence.
[03:07:12.796 --> 03:07:13.617]  I'm not saying us.
[03:07:14.077 --> 03:07:15.177]  I'm not saying the Patriots.
[03:07:15.378 --> 03:07:16.458]  I'm not saying the Infowars.
[03:07:16.578 --> 03:07:20.841]  I'm saying they will, because we're never going to bend the knee.
[03:07:20.881 --> 03:07:22.401]  We will always want our freedom.
[03:07:22.802 --> 03:07:24.583]  So they will have to result to that.
[03:07:25.143 --> 03:07:27.024]  They'll be the ones to initiate that.
[03:07:28.536 --> 03:07:29.577]  And I'm not saying we are.
[03:07:29.637 --> 03:07:31.039]  I'm always for self-defense.
[03:07:31.059 --> 03:07:33.202]  I'm always an advocate for self-defense.
[03:07:34.683 --> 03:07:37.206]  But we know historically, that's where they will go.
[03:07:37.246 --> 03:08:01.146]   But right now, we can take a look at their playbooks, and their playbooks According to what I've been watching and seeing and the same commonality, the way they're going about this is they declare public health emergencies and that gives them emergency powers and that gives them the excuse for full government overreach, martial law, whatever they want to do, deploy the military, strip you of your rights, strip you of your guns, strip you of your First Amendment.
[03:08:01.166 --> 03:08:05.787]  They can strip you of everything in the name of a public health emergency.
[03:08:06.848 --> 03:08:13.714]   So any one of these agendas they roll out moving forward, Just pay very close attention.
[03:08:13.834 --> 03:08:15.514]  It will be done in that name.
[03:08:15.594 --> 03:08:19.536]  It will all be done in the name of a public health emergency.
[03:08:20.736 --> 03:08:23.557]  Even if they come out, like I said, with the climate change lockdowns.
[03:08:24.158 --> 03:08:31.280]  I personally believe when they do that, they'll probably start false flag, they'll start fires.
[03:08:31.320 --> 03:08:34.442]  The same thing the evil emperor, Roman Emperor Nero did.
[03:08:34.962 --> 03:08:37.443]  False fires, mass fires across the empire.
[03:08:37.683 --> 03:08:38.763]  Blame it on the Christians.
[03:08:40.104 --> 03:08:47.713]   You know how easy they could do And just use the state approved media.
[03:08:48.793 --> 03:08:51.694]  They'll give CNN, Fox News, their marching orders.
[03:08:52.134 --> 03:08:58.035]  You communicate to the people that this is because of climate change and because of their carbon footprints too high.
[03:08:58.315 --> 03:09:01.975]  Now everything is incinerating because humanity doesn't want to listen.
[03:09:02.196 --> 03:09:05.776]  When they themselves could easily, easily, you know how easy it would be?
[03:09:05.796 --> 03:09:09.817]  To commit mass arson, the federal government.
[03:09:10.956 --> 03:09:12.537]  Dude, and who would investigate that?
[03:09:13.057 --> 03:09:13.557]  Oh, I don't know.
[03:09:13.897 --> 03:09:15.018]  Maybe the federal government.
[03:09:15.338 --> 03:09:21.401]  Oh, well, it wasn't, this wasn't man, this was not man, this was not man-made mass fires.
[03:09:21.501 --> 03:09:23.222]  No, this is climate change.
[03:09:23.902 --> 03:09:31.165]  You'll get some expert, some hack, you'll get the climate change version of Dr. Fauci up there.
[03:09:31.245 --> 03:09:35.767]  It's the same damn thing that you're going to see across the entire board moving forward.
[03:09:37.248 --> 03:09:45.415]   But Speaking of their agendas, and to kind of show you that, I mean, I think everybody saw that and thank God there was a huge pushback.
[03:09:46.236 --> 03:09:49.957]  Because if there's not a pushback, we should be absolutely concerned.
[03:09:50.698 --> 03:09:53.139]  But that's why the censorship is so intense.
[03:09:53.419 --> 03:10:00.620]   That's why the deplatforming and the shadowbanning and the deboosting That's why it is so intense and that's why it is so important.
[03:10:00.640 --> 03:10:02.660]  Yes, it's about shutting down dissidents.
[03:10:02.720 --> 03:10:07.601]  Yes, it's about shutting down speech and ideas and thoughts that unlock minds.
[03:10:07.921 --> 03:10:13.182]  But it's also to give a perception to the American people that, well, that's the minority.
[03:10:13.662 --> 03:10:14.643]  That's just a fringe.
[03:10:14.683 --> 03:10:16.503]  That's why they use the term fringe.
[03:10:17.343 --> 03:10:18.223]  That's a fringe.
[03:10:18.824 --> 03:10:20.164]  That's a fringe sect.
[03:10:20.584 --> 03:10:21.244]  That's a minority.
[03:10:21.264 --> 03:10:22.184]  What did Mitt Romney say?
[03:10:22.204 --> 03:10:23.565]  That's a minority of the party.
[03:10:26.132 --> 03:10:28.274]  You know, there will be a resurgence.
[03:10:28.294 --> 03:10:29.855]  Did you catch that in Romney's statements?
[03:10:30.416 --> 03:10:33.418]  In that ridiculous video and interview with CNN?
[03:10:35.160 --> 03:10:37.282]  He says there will be a resurgence of rhinos.
[03:10:37.322 --> 03:10:38.322]  That's what he's essentially saying.
[03:10:38.342 --> 03:10:40.164]  There will be a resurgence of the establishment.
[03:10:40.745 --> 03:10:42.326]  Mitt Romney is New World Order.
[03:10:42.806 --> 03:10:44.228]  Mitt Romney is deep state.
[03:10:44.268 --> 03:10:44.968]  He's compromised.
[03:10:45.008 --> 03:10:46.069]  He's not America first.
[03:10:47.150 --> 03:10:49.892]  Openly stating to the American people, there will be a resurgence.
[03:10:50.513 --> 03:10:51.594]  There's gonna be a resurgence.
[03:10:52.529 --> 03:10:52.769]  Why?
[03:10:52.809 --> 03:10:54.030]  Because they have plans too.
[03:10:54.350 --> 03:10:56.151]  And they know just exactly what they want to do.
[03:10:56.411 --> 03:10:58.312]  And they know that they have lost ground.
[03:10:58.352 --> 03:11:08.218]  That's why they are so aggressively going after Trump and anyone in the orbit of his first campaign and run that got him in.
[03:11:08.238 --> 03:11:16.282]  Steve Bannon, Roger Stone, and obviously Infowars and Alex Jones played a huge role in Trump 2016.
[03:11:16.823 --> 03:11:17.943]  And they're going to do the same thing.
[03:11:17.963 --> 03:11:19.004]  They're still doing it today.
[03:11:19.084 --> 03:11:19.284]  Trump 2020.
[03:11:19.784 --> 03:11:21.085]  Look at everyone involved.
[03:11:21.892 --> 03:11:30.015]  Okay, with challenging the election results, everyone in Trump's orbit is getting indicted and targeted by the weaponized three-letter agencies.
[03:11:30.415 --> 03:11:31.995]  This is only going to continue.
[03:11:32.416 --> 03:11:39.458]  And the reason why it's only going to continue is because that is how the weaponization of tyrannical regimes are always going to function.
[03:11:39.978 --> 03:11:47.040]  And the way that you're going to see this continue to increase and increase and increase is they have to have their villains.
[03:11:48.081 --> 03:11:48.921]  It's like a movie.
[03:11:49.744 --> 03:11:56.830]  You're not going to believe a genuine movie between good and evil if there isn't a believable evil character.
[03:11:58.011 --> 03:12:04.877]  And you're not going to have a legitimate movie between good and evil if there's not a legitimate, believable, good character.
[03:12:05.825 --> 03:12:10.767]  So the characters that they're putting together in their simulation and their movie, look at Alex Jones.
[03:12:10.807 --> 03:12:11.587]  He's the bad man.
[03:12:11.948 --> 03:12:12.648]  He's the villain.
[03:12:12.848 --> 03:12:13.748]  Look at Donald Trump.
[03:12:13.888 --> 03:12:14.649]  He's the bad man.
[03:12:14.809 --> 03:12:15.369]  He's the villain.
[03:12:15.409 --> 03:12:16.549]  Look at everyone in his orbit.
[03:12:16.690 --> 03:12:17.810]  They colluded with Putin.
[03:12:18.030 --> 03:12:19.051]  Everything is Putin's fault.
[03:12:19.291 --> 03:12:20.431]  Everything is Putin's fault.
[03:12:20.871 --> 03:12:22.152]  I had a stomachache this morning.
[03:12:22.272 --> 03:12:23.472]  That's Putin's fault too!
[03:12:24.453 --> 03:12:25.753]  All the villains are in order.
[03:12:26.754 --> 03:12:29.655]  And the followers of the villains are all in order.
[03:12:30.771 --> 03:12:37.836]  The armies of the villains, the Infowarriors, the mega Republicans, the domestic right-wing extremist terrorists.
[03:12:38.557 --> 03:12:48.204]  They've got all their villains in order because they're setting the stage so that the NPCs watching the movie that are stuck in the Matrix, they just believe all this crap.
[03:12:48.564 --> 03:12:53.748]  But their miscalculation is there's more of us than there are of the NPCs.
[03:12:54.428 --> 03:12:55.829]  We got to continue to unlock their minds.
[03:12:55.849 --> 03:12:56.430]  We'll be right back.
[03:12:57.245 --> 03:12:58.466]  Alright guys, we are back.
[03:12:58.486 --> 03:13:00.467]  I want to thank you guys for tuning in.
[03:13:01.348 --> 03:13:03.369]  The fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:13:03.429 --> 03:13:05.231]  I'm your guest host, Drew Hernandez.

[03:13:37.540 --> 03:13:49.103]  I think what's taking place right now with the ultimate legal lawfare and assaults against InfoWars and Alex Jones is leading down a path where it's up to you guys to keep this alive.
[03:13:49.443 --> 03:13:56.865]  So InfoWarsStore.com, we appreciate every single one of you guys and all of your continued support over the years and all the way up until now into the future.

[03:13:58.216 --> 03:14:00.237]  You guys are awesome.
[03:14:00.257 --> 03:14:01.318]  Well, let's take a look at this story.
[03:14:01.358 --> 03:14:08.324]  I really wanted to cover this because speaking of the plans of what the New World Order is definitely up to and what they're doing.
[03:14:09.105 --> 03:14:10.866]  This is a great article from the Epoch Times.
[03:14:11.246 --> 03:14:19.733]  G20 announces plan to impose digital currencies and IDs worldwide, but pay very close attention to what they were saying at G20.
[03:14:19.753 --> 03:14:26.119]  The leaders of the group of 20 nations have agreed to a plan to eventually impose digital currencies and digital IDs.
[03:14:26.994 --> 03:14:34.480]  On their respective populations amid concern that governments might use them to monitor their people's spending and crush dissent.
[03:14:35.120 --> 03:14:45.569]  The G20, which is made up of the world's leading rich and developing nations and is currently under India's presidency, adopted a final declaration on the subject over the weekend in New Delhi.
[03:14:46.289 --> 03:14:53.955]  The group announced last week that they had agreed to build the necessary infrastructure to implement digital currencies and IDs.
[03:14:55.626 --> 03:14:58.448]  Digital currencies and IDs.
[03:14:59.189 --> 03:15:02.631]  I wanted to emphasize a portion of what's going on here.
[03:15:02.651 --> 03:15:03.472]  What happened at the G20.
[03:15:04.152 --> 03:15:05.513]  Listen to how they talk about this.
[03:15:05.573 --> 03:15:08.816]  It's very similar to what I talked about in the last segment.
[03:15:09.818 --> 03:15:11.559]  They have plans rolled out.
[03:15:11.699 --> 03:15:19.203]  They have these preliminary test runs and they use them as a blueprint and a model for what they can interchange.
[03:15:19.744 --> 03:15:34.052]   Whether it's the public health emergency of guns and we need more gun control or the public health emergency of COVID or the next bioweapon they decide to roll out that's 200, 500 times worse than COVID.
[03:15:34.072 --> 03:15:38.354]  And they all talk about this, a pathogen that is so deadly where the whole world will have to be locked down.
[03:15:38.494 --> 03:15:39.394]  We have to prepare.
[03:15:39.594 --> 03:15:41.135]  We have to have the infrastructure there.
[03:15:41.155 --> 03:15:53.842]  Or like I said, whether it's the climate change death cult lockdowns, false flags and intentional arson started by the federal government, the governments of the world, they can go in any direction.
[03:15:53.902 --> 03:15:59.925]  And like I said, the lockouts of the economy, the digital currency infrastructure, all AI driven.
[03:16:00.928 --> 03:16:07.842]  Where you lose your banking and your checking account because you have wrong think, you have hate speech, or unauthorized minds.
[03:16:08.740 --> 03:16:09.441]  Take a look at this.
[03:16:09.481 --> 03:16:13.805]  The EC chief was re-emphasizing the need for these digital IDs.
[03:16:14.305 --> 03:16:28.098]  At the summit, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for digital ID systems similar to COVID-19 vaccine passports and for an international regulatory body for artificial intelligence.
[03:16:28.538 --> 03:16:38.287]   This is everything that I opened up the show with because I just don't have these ideas in my mind.
[03:16:38.527 --> 03:16:39.889]  They say this stuff.
[03:16:41.270 --> 03:16:52.281]  They are just openly out there talking about what they want to do in their tyrannical, homicidal, psychotic, narcissistic, globalist minds.
[03:16:54.643 --> 03:16:56.765]  They want it to be internationally regulated.
[03:16:58.413 --> 03:17:00.154]  For artificial intelligence also.
[03:17:00.554 --> 03:17:02.075]  Oh, is that to get rid of the bad guys?
[03:17:02.135 --> 03:17:06.317]  Yeah, yeah, you and me, the patriots, the freedom lovers and fighters.
[03:17:07.177 --> 03:17:19.963]  She called for the United Nations to have a role in AI regulation and called the European Union's COVID-19 digital certificate a perfect model for digital public infrastructures, DPI.
[03:17:19.983 --> 03:17:21.324]  They even have an acronym for it.
[03:17:22.293 --> 03:17:24.395]  Which would include digital IDs.
[03:17:25.075 --> 03:17:29.159]  She said, many of you are familiar with the COVID-19 digital certificate.
[03:17:29.659 --> 03:17:31.841]  The EU developed it for itself.
[03:17:32.421 --> 03:17:41.208]  The model was so functional and so trusted that 51 countries on four continents adopted it for free, she said.
[03:17:41.929 --> 03:17:50.516]  Today, the World Health Organization uses it as a global standard to facilitate mobility in times of health threats.
[03:17:51.437 --> 03:17:55.779]  I want to thank Dr. Tedros again for the excellent cooperation, she said.
[03:17:55.799 --> 03:18:10.026]  So listen, I don't even have to say this or speculate or give my analysis or prediction as to what these people are going to do in terms of what is of biblical proportions.
[03:18:10.306 --> 03:18:15.569]  And I'm not saying that because that's a flashy term to say on television or radio or on the internet.
[03:18:16.569 --> 03:18:17.970]  That's 100% an authentic statement.
[03:18:20.535 --> 03:18:29.125]  That the way that the future is going, and this is why Klaus Schwab wants a hold of the technologies, and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab, they praise Bill Gates because this infrastructure already exists.
[03:18:29.465 --> 03:18:35.692]  It's already being used against the Chinese people by the tyrannical psychopath homicidal maniacs of the CCP and Xi Jinping.
[03:18:35.712 --> 03:18:37.875]  That's why they all look up to them and praise them.
[03:18:38.375 --> 03:18:40.678]  All this kind of technology already exists.
[03:18:41.815 --> 03:18:43.476]  But they say it themselves.
[03:18:43.496 --> 03:18:45.237]  Do you see the COVID-19?
[03:18:45.477 --> 03:18:47.178]  You see those vaccine passports?
[03:18:47.478 --> 03:18:48.859]  You see those global IDs?
[03:18:49.099 --> 03:18:51.740]  We need to regulate that worldwide.
[03:18:52.181 --> 03:18:54.062]  AI technology influence.
[03:18:54.242 --> 03:19:00.965]  We need to package that for digital, global, world, citizenship IDs in the future.
[03:19:01.045 --> 03:19:05.448]  Isn't it interesting, guys, that they do not want IDs for voting?
[03:19:06.115 --> 03:19:18.962]  They call that racist and bad, but they want a global ID that is AI controlled, that is biometric influenced and accessed, so they can target and surveil and enforce anything they want upon you.
[03:19:19.222 --> 03:19:21.623]  They think that's good, that's totally great.
[03:19:21.864 --> 03:19:31.389]  Yeah, global passports for humanity and the global New World Order, good, but ID for voting, bad and racist.
[03:19:32.069 --> 03:19:36.592]  Yeah, of course it's hypocritical, but it's intentionally hypocritical because it's by design.
[03:19:37.172 --> 03:19:47.498]  It's to get the retards, the normies, and the NPCs that do not even listen to what they say about their psychotic New World Order plans!
[03:19:48.766 --> 03:19:49.726]  It's what they say!
[03:19:49.746 --> 03:19:51.627]  I just read you direct quotes!
[03:19:52.267 --> 03:19:53.968]  They say, the model's here!
[03:19:54.268 --> 03:19:55.848]  Look what we did with COVID-19!
[03:19:56.128 --> 03:20:03.551]  That's the same infrastructure we need for digital, globalist, citizen passports in the future.
[03:20:05.271 --> 03:20:08.212]  You see, it's the normies that need to wake up.
[03:20:08.533 --> 03:20:10.993]  The NPCs that damn well need to wake up.
[03:20:11.714 --> 03:20:15.775]  But it's also those that are fully in cooperation.
[03:20:16.658 --> 03:20:25.721]  With the regime and the cabal that will just bend the knee to this, just like WorldCoin, use your biometrics to gain access to the digital dollar, the digital currency.
[03:20:26.221 --> 03:20:28.422]  And they all promise, oh, it's not going to be centralized.
[03:20:28.462 --> 03:20:29.602]  It'll be decentralized.
[03:20:29.622 --> 03:20:30.422]  Yeah, give me a break.
[03:20:31.022 --> 03:20:34.763]  Like the federal government, just like they infiltrated big tech, established the Internet.
[03:20:34.964 --> 03:20:35.904]  They centralized that.
[03:20:35.944 --> 03:20:37.204]  They want to take it a step further.
[03:20:38.225 --> 03:20:38.685]  Just wait.
[03:20:39.325 --> 03:20:40.985]  Just wait till they fully roll out.
[03:20:41.926 --> 03:20:46.267]  They fully roll out an AI hive economic system.
[03:20:47.344 --> 03:20:49.845]  I mean, this is why I said it's of biblical proportions.
[03:20:49.905 --> 03:20:51.526]  It's not just a catchy thing to say.
[03:20:51.906 --> 03:20:54.067]  This is what the Bible has foretold.
[03:20:54.407 --> 03:20:57.948]  There will be a one world economic system.
[03:20:58.288 --> 03:21:05.091]  You will not be able to gain access into it unless you receive the mark of the beast in your right hand or your forehead.
[03:21:05.111 --> 03:21:06.952]  I'm not saying that's exactly what this is.
[03:21:07.552 --> 03:21:11.213]  What I'm saying is the infrastructure 100% exists.
[03:21:11.653 --> 03:21:19.488]   It's either God and his people were just Somehow in tune perfectly with the future.
[03:21:21.289 --> 03:21:23.490]  Or God is 100% authentically real.
[03:21:24.290 --> 03:21:42.737]  And he has spoken through his people thousands of years ago that have predicted, predicted a society and a global world satanic regime that was so technologically advanced that they would be able to enforce an entire economy at once.
[03:21:43.871 --> 03:21:51.277]  You know, when this was written 2,000 years ago in the Book of Revelation, nobody knew what that even meant or how that could even be possible.
[03:21:51.958 --> 03:21:59.364]  But you and I know perfectly well how easily that could be enforced, rolled out, yesterday.
[03:22:00.305 --> 03:22:02.627]  It's not speculation of this kind of technology.
[03:22:02.887 --> 03:22:04.008]  It's openly talked about.
[03:22:04.048 --> 03:22:04.729]  It's called for.
[03:22:05.552 --> 03:22:11.457]  By the EU, the World Health Organization, it's openly talked about by these globalist entities at the G20.
[03:22:12.037 --> 03:22:17.681]  It's openly conversated, it's openly discussed for future purposes and uses.
[03:22:18.322 --> 03:22:27.869]  And if anyone is going to be that stupid and naive to sit here and think, well, nothing can go wrong, that'll definitely not be weaponized against humanity.
[03:22:28.009 --> 03:22:30.311]  I don't care what your politics are, dude.
[03:22:30.931 --> 03:22:33.273]  This is a threat to you and your family.
[03:22:34.167 --> 03:22:40.931]  You could be the most old school Democrat possible, if that even exists today.
[03:22:41.892 --> 03:22:44.974]  Does it matter Republican, right or left?
[03:22:45.354 --> 03:22:45.594]  No.
[03:22:46.374 --> 03:22:53.699]  What matters is, are you in obedience to the regime itself and anything the regime tells you to be obedient to?
[03:22:54.733 --> 03:23:08.645]  That's the question that must be answered as to whether you will be allowed to survive, bank, buy, sell, trade, have any type of freedom in the regime of the New World Order of the future that already exists today.
[03:23:09.686 --> 03:23:10.887]  What's your answer to that question?
[03:23:10.907 --> 03:23:13.810]  I'll obey or I'll disobey.
[03:23:14.443 --> 03:23:15.664]  Not what your politics are.
[03:23:16.084 --> 03:23:17.926]  Because fundamentally that's what it comes down to.
[03:23:17.946 --> 03:23:18.746]  Alrighty guys!
[03:23:19.047 --> 03:23:22.669]  The great Owen Schroyer, the political prisoner, is up next.

[03:23:24.451 --> 03:23:25.411]  Do not go anywhere.

[03:23:27.852 --> 03:23:29.852]  Salute to all of you guys.

[03:23:47.869 --> 03:23:52.109]   at JonesCrowder.com I
[03:23:52.109 --> 03:24:02.067]   Won't explain this to you It's like, you own a car.
[03:24:02.187 --> 03:24:03.628]  This broadcast is your car.
[03:24:03.748 --> 03:24:05.610]  The show you've supported, it's yours.
[03:24:05.890 --> 03:24:06.610]  You supported it.
[03:24:06.690 --> 03:24:07.511]  You spread the word.
[03:24:07.811 --> 03:24:08.511]  You prayed for it.
[03:24:08.691 --> 03:24:09.552]  It's your car.
[03:24:09.732 --> 03:24:15.115]  And if you don't put oil in the engine, and I got smoke coming out the tailpipe, it's gonna seize up and blow up.
[03:24:15.316 --> 03:24:17.037]  So, it's a real simple equation.
[03:24:17.177 --> 03:24:18.337]  You decide now.
[03:24:19.378 --> 03:24:22.721]  To go to infowarestore.com, and that supports free speech, and that's great.
[03:24:23.061 --> 03:24:25.122]  But free speech is stabilized and doing okay right now.
[03:24:25.403 --> 03:24:26.263]  Not great, but okay.
[03:24:26.383 --> 03:24:30.806]  But you decide to go to defendjones.com, and it takes you to GiveSimGo and those great folks over there.
[03:24:30.847 --> 03:24:39.653]  You make a $10, $100, $1,000, whatever you can donation, and then I can pay my legal team that have not been paid in almost a year.
[03:24:39.773 --> 03:24:41.034]  And they're still cool with it.
[03:24:41.074 --> 03:24:44.897]  They still believe they're gonna get through the bankruptcy, and they're gonna get the contract, you know, for me.
[03:24:44.976 --> 03:24:49.775]   done so I can get paid. You understand I'm paid 40% of my salary I agreed to a year ago in the bankruptcy.
[03:24:49.775 --> 03:24:53.075]   They didn't have the money. 1.5 million, that would only pay my legal bills.
[03:24:53.075 --> 03:24:59.176]   No money. I spent everything I had already. And they're just nicely waiting and hoping the judge approves that.
[03:24:59.176 --> 03:25:03.776]  And I'm like, we don't want to be negative in the tank.
[03:25:03.926 --> 03:25:04.767]  We're not talking about empty.
[03:25:04.787 --> 03:25:05.928]  We're, like, way below empty.
[03:25:06.088 --> 03:25:06.869]  We need the funds.
[03:25:07.129 --> 03:25:18.320]  So, I'm just telling you, if you don't go to DefendJones.com, it is literally you, not the Globalist, not the Left, not the pedophile New World Order, not George Soros that will pull our plug.
[03:25:18.520 --> 03:25:19.021]  It will be you.
[03:25:19.341 --> 03:25:20.622]  So, I'm not guilting you.
[03:25:20.702 --> 03:25:21.884]  I respect you and appreciate you.
[03:25:22.004 --> 03:25:25.147]  I'm just saying, I think it's a no-brainer to keep M4 Wars in the game.
[03:25:25.287 --> 03:25:27.009]  I think it's a no-brainer to not give them this victory.
[03:25:27.029 --> 03:25:28.529]   So, This is your broadcast.
[03:25:28.589 --> 03:25:29.570]  This is your vehicle.
[03:25:29.690 --> 03:25:37.211]  And if you choose to keep driving it around and don't put the oil in the tank, and I'm not blaming you, I'm telling you, hey, you might not notice there's black smoke coming out the back, then that's your choice.
[03:25:37.371 --> 03:25:43.533]  But I cannot continue on and I cannot do this broadcast if we don't raise in the next month a million dollars.
[03:25:43.573 --> 03:25:44.833]  And that should not be that much.
[03:25:44.893 --> 03:25:46.094]  I mean, we reach millions of people.
[03:25:46.214 --> 03:25:47.834]  DefendJones.com.
[03:25:48.094 --> 03:25:49.834]  Everything is up to you.
