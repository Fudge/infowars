[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:09.372]  Minnesota lawmakers advanced transgender reps legislation that could strip custody from parents who don't support child being sterilized.
[00:00:10.893 --> 00:00:17.435]  Arizona Family Dollar employee charged with murder after allegedly gunning down cereal shoplifter who punched him in the face.
[00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.587]  Minnesota advances trans-refugee bill.
[00:00:21.747 --> 00:00:25.648]  Opponents say it would strip custody from non-consenting parents.
[00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:27.689]  You must consent to the state sterilizing your child.
[00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.930]  GOP bill would protect parents who refuse to transition their child's gender.
[00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.550]  Fox News.
[00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:35.091]  And a whole lot more.
[00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:39.192]  Tennessee legislature passes ban on gender transition health care for minors.
[00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:44.774]  Kentucky governor says he's going to veto a bill protecting minor children from being sterilized by the state.
[00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.710]  Idaho signs transgender bathroom ban.
[00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:51.912]  School faces $5,000 fine per infraction.
[00:00:52.892 --> 00:01:01.176]  I've got public schools around the country where they're forcing elementary students, middle students, and high school students into transgender bathrooms.
[00:01:01.316 --> 00:01:03.937]  Everyone is in the same bathroom at the same time.
[00:01:04.317 --> 00:01:08.679]  They're telling children it's a hate crime if they don't strip down in front of the opposite sex.
[00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:12.421]  What a sick cult of evil garbage.
[00:01:17.393 --> 00:01:21.816]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:22.176 --> 00:01:24.176]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:32.416]  It's Monday, March 27th.
[00:01:32.384 --> 00:01:39.109]  And we've got an incredible transmission lined up for you today.
[00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:44.052]  But first, Ted Nugent and the Star-Spangled Banner from Waco, Texas, Saturday.
[00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:46.212]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:01:46.212 --> 00:01:48.212]  [Music]
[00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:50.212]  [Music]
[00:01:50.212 --> 00:01:52.212]  [Music]
[00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.212]  [Music]
[00:01:54.212 --> 00:02:23.453]  [Music]
[00:02:23.584 --> 00:02:26.607]  Well, glory, glory, hallelujah, look!
[00:02:26.827 --> 00:02:28.468]  It's real America!
[00:02:32.492 --> 00:02:41.219]  I'm telling you, the whole world sucks, and America's catching up, but here in Waco, Texas, with the real shit-kickers, this don't suck at all!
[00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:43.761]  Hey, look!
[00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:45.122]  Everybody take a look!
[00:02:45.203 --> 00:02:46.524]  Take a good look around you.
[00:02:47.324 --> 00:02:48.846]  This is real Texas.
[00:02:51.747 --> 00:03:07.014]  You are the shit kickers that drive the American dream and do you know how much I love you?
[00:03:07.114 --> 00:03:09.755]  How about if I do a little prayer myself?
[00:03:11.456 --> 00:03:18.759]  How about a prayer for our fellow Americans down in Mississippi right now who have been hit by a pissed off Mother Nature?
[00:03:20.322 --> 00:03:26.086]  About a prayer for the political prisoners in Washington, D.C.
[00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:37.114]  who are victims of jackbooted thugs by Uncle Sam who defy their oath to the Constitution and arrest Americans and do not allow them constitutional rights.
[00:03:37.174 --> 00:03:42.478]  A moment of silence for the political prisoners in the gulags of Washington, D.C.
[00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:54.179]   Because of jack-booted thugs in our own government I'm a guitar player
[00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:54.742]  I have a couple demands.
[00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:56.463]  Secure my border!
[00:03:56.483 --> 00:04:01.806]  I have a couple really good ideas.
[00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:03.828]  Give me my tax dollars back!
[00:04:04.108 --> 00:04:07.030]  I didn't authorize killing babies at Planned Parenthood.
[00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.011]  I want my tax dollars back!
[00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:13.514]  I want my tax dollars back!
[00:04:13.594 --> 00:04:17.057]  I didn't authorize giving our military hardware to the Taliban.
[00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.898]  I want my money back!
[00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:23.315]  I want my money back!
[00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:27.876]  I didn't authorize any money to Ukraine to some homosexual white weirdo!
[00:04:27.896 --> 00:04:31.938]  I want my money back!
[00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.359]  I want my freedom back!
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.560]  Hey, here's an idea.
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.801]  You might want to write this down.
[00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:40.942]  I'm a free man.
[00:04:42.142 --> 00:04:43.703]  Men don't give me my rights.
[00:04:44.323 --> 00:04:46.204]  God gives me my rights.
[00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:52.949]  And I don't need a man to give me paperwork for my First Amendment.
[00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:56.030]  I don't need a permit or a license for my First Amendment.
[00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.031]  My First Amendment is good while I'm alive, walking planet Earth without a permit!
[00:05:05.032 --> 00:05:06.032]  And here's a wild one.
[00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:07.332]  You know how radical I am?
[00:05:07.352 --> 00:05:09.353]  I experiment in self-government.
[00:05:09.513 --> 00:05:10.313]  How radical, huh?
[00:05:11.553 --> 00:05:12.313]  Here's another one.
[00:05:12.553 --> 00:05:15.894]  I have a First Amendment without a license, without a permit.
[00:05:16.254 --> 00:05:19.375]  I have a Second Amendment without a license or a permit.
[00:05:19.615 --> 00:05:21.296]  And it's good on planet Earth.
[00:05:23.016 --> 00:05:24.316]  Keep means it's mine.
[00:05:24.396 --> 00:05:25.417]  You can't have it.
[00:05:25.537 --> 00:05:27.997]  Bear means I... Well, I had a couple on me a minute ago.
[00:05:28.337 --> 00:05:32.479]  But typically... Oh, and by the way, another prayer for the snipers on the roof.
[00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:33.419]  I love those guys.
[00:05:35.042 --> 00:05:40.242]   Let's have a prayer for all the law enforcement heroes that obey their oath to the Constitution,
[00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:44.242]  not the FBI that violate their oath to the Constitution.
[00:05:44.242 --> 00:05:59.741]  [Music]
[00:05:59.741 --> 00:06:01.241]  All right, folks, we're going to break.
[00:06:01.172 --> 00:06:02.052]  We're going to come back.
[00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.971]  We're going to take a lot of calls, covered a ton of news today.
[00:06:05.011 --> 00:06:05.891]  I'm loaded for bear.
[00:06:06.551 --> 00:06:07.831]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:06:09.192 --> 00:06:10.032]  It's 1104 Central.
[00:06:10.052 --> 00:06:12.252]  Please tell everybody you know and people you don't know, tune in now.
[00:06:12.312 --> 00:06:13.633]  It's how we break the back of the sensors.
[00:06:14.053 --> 00:06:14.913]  We're going over the top.
[00:06:14.933 --> 00:06:17.374]  We're starting to win, but now is the most intense part of the fight.
[00:06:17.914 --> 00:06:21.575]  I'm Alexander Emmerich Jones coming to you from the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:28.998]  The New World Order is doing everything they can to bring down honest America and every free nation, every free person on Earth.
[00:06:29.018 --> 00:06:37.203]  But humanity is waking up and the answer to the 1984 tyranny is rediscovering what made America great, like tyrants ferret.
[00:06:37.642 --> 00:06:44.642]  The answer to 1984, the answer to the tyranny is 1776.

[00:06:51.642 --> 00:06:58.642]  [Music]
[00:06:58.642 --> 00:07:05.642]  [Music]
[00:07:05.642 --> 00:07:12.642]  [Music]
[00:07:12.642 --> 00:07:19.642]  [Music]
[00:07:19.642 --> 00:07:26.642]  [Music]
[00:07:26.642 --> 00:07:33.642]  [Music]
[00:07:33.642 --> 00:07:40.642]  [Music]
[00:07:40.642 --> 00:07:47.642]  [Music]

[00:07:54.642 --> 00:08:01.642]  [Music]
[00:08:01.642 --> 00:08:02.642]  That's Ted Nugent.
[00:08:02.642 --> 00:08:05.142]  (baby crying)
[00:08:03.989 --> 00:08:09.152]  Saturday, warming the crowd up to that 40, 50,000 person group that showed up in the middle of Texas.
[00:08:11.814 --> 00:08:16.978]  And I tell you, I've seen Ted Nugent play it in his living room for me, and it was even better.
[00:08:18.859 --> 00:08:20.480]  It's always better in person, but it's great.
[00:08:21.941 --> 00:08:24.763]  The tyrants fear what our republic was and what it could be again.
[00:08:27.059 --> 00:08:29.781]  The land of the free, the home of the brave.
[00:08:31.482 --> 00:08:36.481]   Yes, we've fallen far, but we can watch the Phoenix rise again.
[00:08:59.981 --> 00:09:01.981]  All right, here's where I stand on Trump.
[00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:04.561]  (upbeat music)
[00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:12.868]   We opened the phones up yesterday and I said, what is your view on Trump?
[00:09:12.888 --> 00:09:14.029]  Are you going to support him or not?
[00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:16.149]  We looked at all the bad he's done.
[00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:17.990]  We looked at a lot of the good he's done.
[00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.771]  He's done so much good, it's hard to look at all of it.
[00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:21.631]  It's a laundry list.
[00:09:22.191 --> 00:09:23.491]  But the bad is there as well.
[00:09:24.412 --> 00:09:30.173]  But the reason I feel drawn to supporting Trump so much is a whole spectrum of reasons.
[00:09:31.694 --> 00:09:34.034]  It's not true that DeSantis is skull and bones at Yale.
[00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.715]  That's something being put out that's not true.
[00:09:37.312 --> 00:09:45.495]  But it is true that he has said in multiple speeches, we have the clips, that George Herbert Walker Bush is his idol and who he thinks he admires the most.
[00:09:47.036 --> 00:09:56.680]  George W. Bush was the Democrat deep stater that helped get more of the New World Order in and set the foundation up for what we're living under than anybody else.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.540]  He's the Rockefeller frontman.
[00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:08.549]   And so you look at Karl Rove and Jeb behind the Santas and supporting him, That makes me have a big problem with DeSantis.
[00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.271]  I like DeSantis coming out more against the shots than Trump.
[00:10:11.812 --> 00:10:15.114]  Sure, he was for him just like Trump was early on, but he came out more against them early.
[00:10:15.134 --> 00:10:16.455]  Did a lot of great things.
[00:10:16.695 --> 00:10:37.240]   So, really what takes me to the point of really supporting Trump over DeSantis is Trump's stalwart Push for peace and anti-war and for not having nuclear war with Russia and stopping and ending the Ukraine operation, which as president he can snap his fingers and do because the people that have hijacked the U.S.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.541]  are the ones running the Ukraine war.
[00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:41.143]  So you got to support Trump because of that.
[00:10:42.043 --> 00:10:50.130]  And then it's the fact that he has the biggest rallies full of the best people of every race, color, and creed who still love this country and don't want government to be God.
[00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.313]  Because communism is where the state tries to be God.
[00:10:54.393 --> 00:10:55.434]  That's the best definition.
[00:10:57.304 --> 00:10:59.126]  And Trump overall stands against that.
[00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:00.827]  And for our borders.
[00:11:02.168 --> 00:11:02.969]  And so much more.
[00:11:03.009 --> 00:11:08.654]  But really, at the end of the day, it's that he's way ahead of DeSantis and all the real polls that are out there.
[00:11:10.676 --> 00:11:12.357]  And the people are with him.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:23.897]   And so, I'm supporting Trump for president, but I'm doing it Not even holding my nose.
[00:11:23.977 --> 00:11:24.958]  In fact, it's the opposite.
[00:11:25.078 --> 00:11:30.602]  I am breathing in the foul stench of the poison shot that's already killed millions worldwide.
[00:11:31.322 --> 00:11:37.507]  And the fact that Trump is so pig-headed and won't admit it was wrong, but at least said we shouldn't make people take the shots and we shouldn't give it to kids.
[00:11:37.587 --> 00:11:40.249]  And he came out against the transgender cult Saturday.
[00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:40.789]  That's good.
[00:11:41.189 --> 00:11:42.530]  He says he'll destroy the deep state.
[00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:43.271]  That's wonderful.
[00:11:44.512 --> 00:11:45.873]  The deep state does really hate him.
[00:11:45.973 --> 00:11:47.174]  He is being persecuted.
[00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:57.597]   But I think that by supporting Trump, We're going to have more ability to influence him and get him to listen than not supporting him.
[00:11:57.777 --> 00:12:01.198]  Because he's going to get the nomination and he's probably going to win the presidency.
[00:12:02.299 --> 00:12:03.219]  So what am I going to do then?
[00:12:03.259 --> 00:12:04.999]  Support DeSantis?
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:27.026]   Now we opened the phones up yesterday and I'd say about almost 70% of the calls, I was sitting there taking notes, We took like 20 calls and 11 or 12 supported Trump.
[00:12:27.946 --> 00:12:31.208]  Four or five didn't support Trump and a few didn't, were neutral.
[00:12:32.328 --> 00:12:33.528]  So the majority supported him.
[00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:35.569]  I want to open the phones up today.
[00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:40.311]  We did a really good job taking a lot of calls, only took calls for an hour.
[00:12:40.431 --> 00:12:41.712]  We took 20 plus calls.
[00:12:42.592 --> 00:12:46.213]  I'm going to open the phones up again today and I'm going to take a hundred calls.
[00:12:47.374 --> 00:12:50.615]  And I'm going to put a big poll up on InfoWars.
[00:12:52.506 --> 00:12:55.547]  And I'm going to ask the listeners, do you support Trump?
[00:12:56.547 --> 00:12:57.627]  Do you support DeSantis?
[00:12:58.507 --> 00:13:00.027]  Do you support Senator Rand Paul?
[00:13:00.827 --> 00:13:02.488]  Do you support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?
[00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:04.428]  Or do you support Biden?
[00:13:05.548 --> 00:13:07.489]  So please have Ben out there doing a great job.
[00:13:08.009 --> 00:13:08.509]  Put that up.
[00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:18.310]  Do you support DeSantis, Trump, Senator Paul, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., or Biden?
[00:13:18.871 --> 00:13:20.991]  Or maybe throw Big Mike in there, Michelle Obama.
[00:13:22.136 --> 00:13:26.718]  And I'm going to see, I know there will be hundreds of thousands of votes today, and I want to see your view on that.
[00:13:27.778 --> 00:13:40.322]  But I'm going to open the phones up because it's important to have a debate about this and to get the Republican Party and the Republican populist movement out there to make this about us demanding the platform from Trump and us holding his nose for the grindstone on it.
[00:13:41.402 --> 00:13:43.463]  Now, then there's the other big national issue.
[00:13:44.545 --> 00:13:45.426]  International issue.
[00:13:45.966 --> 00:13:52.570]  I said yesterday, and it's all over top of Yahoo, top of Apple News, MSNBC, New York Times.
[00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.811]  They're all reporting and twisting what I said.
[00:13:55.451 --> 00:13:59.754]  Jones gives a frightening prophecy.
[00:14:00.834 --> 00:14:08.599]  Jones gives a dark prophecy that Trump will be killed if he gets the nomination and is set to win.
[00:14:10.114 --> 00:14:12.216]  I said the Deep State is trying to put him in prison.
[00:14:12.236 --> 00:14:13.276]  The Deep State hates his guts.
[00:14:13.857 --> 00:14:17.139]  And I think that's a no-brainer to say when they're all over the news.
[00:14:17.219 --> 00:14:19.361]  In fact, I sent you guys a couple tweets.
[00:14:20.682 --> 00:14:21.503]  I didn't see them in the stack.
[00:14:21.543 --> 00:14:23.044]  Maybe I missed them, but I'll send them again.
[00:14:23.064 --> 00:14:29.629]  I saw hundreds of them, but only sent you a few saying, yeah, we hope Trump gets killed and we hope Alex Jones gets killed too.
[00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.810]  That was all over Twitter.
[00:14:33.111 --> 00:14:34.893]  I'm not predicting he's going to get killed.
[00:14:36.187 --> 00:14:39.630]  I'm saying I agree with the caller that he needs more security.
[00:14:40.811 --> 00:14:43.794]  And he even reportedly said last week, I'm ready to perp walk.
[00:14:44.215 --> 00:14:45.316]  I'm ready to wear the handcuffs.
[00:14:45.356 --> 00:14:46.437]  I'm not going to be led in the back.
[00:14:46.777 --> 00:14:48.859]  If I get assassinated in New York, then I'll be a martyr.
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.801]  I think Trump knows that too.
[00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:59.689]  And I was interviewed by the Secret Service because Trump requested they interview me five, six years ago.
[00:15:00.916 --> 00:15:08.662]  When I called Trump and I talked to him and I said, sir, all these Democrats are on TV saying you'll soon be gone.
[00:15:10.363 --> 00:15:18.970]  And Clapper and Brennan went on a CIA event conference on C-SPAN and said, soon he'll be gone by December.
[00:15:19.811 --> 00:15:21.192]  And they said, you mean impeachment?
[00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:22.332]  They said, no, the other way.
[00:15:23.633 --> 00:15:24.974]  So I made a big deal about it on air.
[00:15:25.015 --> 00:15:30.479]  I called Trump and I gave him a list of five or six Democrats that just said he'd soon be gone and that he'd be dead.
[00:15:32.025 --> 00:15:37.287]  And the Secret Service called me and said, the president requested we call you and give us your intelligence.
[00:15:37.327 --> 00:15:38.888]  And I said, my intelligence?
[00:15:39.868 --> 00:15:44.830]  I wasn't rude to the agents on the phone, but I said, I mean, are you, are you living under a rock?
[00:15:47.552 --> 00:15:48.372]  You're the Secret Service.
[00:15:48.392 --> 00:15:49.392]  You're not living under a rock.
[00:15:51.173 --> 00:15:54.034]  And yeah, these people are all saying they're going to kill him.
[00:15:54.695 --> 00:15:55.135]  My God.
[00:15:56.494 --> 00:15:58.035]  So I'm not hoping that happens.
[00:15:58.215 --> 00:16:03.197]  I'm telling you that you got to admire the courage Trump's got because he is not backing down.
[00:16:03.897 --> 00:16:06.098]  We got a bunch of other news to cover, but I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:16:06.118 --> 00:16:08.759]  We're going to take a hundred phone calls today.
[00:16:09.099 --> 00:16:09.459]  A hundred.
[00:16:09.499 --> 00:16:09.779]  Watch.
[00:16:10.379 --> 00:16:10.980]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:11.420]  Stay with us.
[00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:27.103]  I will immediately sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other racial, sexual, or political content on our children.
[00:16:31.827 --> 00:16:39.734]  I will fight for parents' rights, including universal school choice and the direct election of school principals by the parents.
[00:16:43.075 --> 00:16:51.037]  If any principal is not getting the job done, the parents should be able to vote to fire and select someone else who will get the job done.
[00:16:52.978 --> 00:17:00.920]  We will defeat the cult of gender ideology to reassert that God created two genders, male and female.
[00:17:00.799 --> 00:17:01.799]  Thank you.
[00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:09.799]  (Applause)
[00:17:09.799 --> 00:17:10.799]  All right.
[00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:11.799]  All right.
[00:17:12.276 --> 00:17:22.901]  I will revoke every Biden policy promoting the disfigurement of our youth and ask Congress to send me a bill prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all 50 states.
[00:17:25.102 --> 00:17:28.544]  And we will keep men out of women's sports.
[00:17:32.265 --> 00:17:37.768]  I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate.
[00:17:42.212 --> 00:17:48.616]  Either the Deep State destroys America, or we destroy the Deep State.
[00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:49.997]  That's the way it's gotta be.
[00:17:51.698 --> 00:17:53.899]  We're at a very pivotal point in our country.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:13.958]   Either we descend into a lawless abyss of open borders, rampant killings, super hyperinflation, which is what we have right now and not coming down, and festering corruption, Or we evict Joe Biden and the Democrats from the White House and we make America great again.
[00:18:16.299 --> 00:18:18.259]  And 2024 is the final battle.
[00:18:18.299 --> 00:18:19.440]  That's going to be the big one.
[00:18:19.259 --> 00:18:27.379]   If you put me back in the White House, their reign will be over and America will be a free
[00:18:27.379 --> 00:18:39.939]  nation once again.
[00:18:39.939 --> 00:18:44.019]  So Trump is 10 times more hardcore now.
[00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:46.819]  And the rhetoric he's putting out will energize the base.
[00:18:47.343 --> 00:18:51.405]  We're taking over the local governments again, despite Soros' attempts to dominate them.
[00:18:51.945 --> 00:18:58.267]  We're having major headway, and we'd be a fool to throw the baby out with the bathwater with Trump.
[00:18:58.367 --> 00:19:09.075]   The problem is, I was thinking about it last night and this morning, He has to come out and say he was lied to about Operation Warp Speed and by Fauci.
[00:19:09.095 --> 00:19:09.856]  We know they came to him.
[00:19:09.896 --> 00:19:10.916]  They said, we can do it quickly.
[00:19:11.257 --> 00:19:12.898]  They already had the so-called vaccine ready.
[00:19:13.238 --> 00:19:14.639]  They lied to him and said they didn't.
[00:19:14.659 --> 00:19:16.120]  Then they claim they made it in two weeks.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:22.284]  He's got to expose that to save lives and stop the next stage pandemic.
[00:19:23.084 --> 00:19:28.047]   But that said, if you're against Trump, Okay, who are we for, and then what is your path?
[00:19:28.527 --> 00:19:40.993]  And I'm saying that legitimately, that I respect you, and I understand your concerns, and I have real concerns, and I don't like the fact that Trump has done the wrong thing on the poison injections.
[00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.384]  But on all these other issues, he's doing a great job.
[00:19:44.484 --> 00:19:48.587]  Look at the comparison to Biden and the New World Order and how much the deep state hates him.
[00:19:49.327 --> 00:19:52.449]  So I'm going to open the phones up right now and intersperse with your calls.
[00:19:52.469 --> 00:19:55.231]  We're going to cover all the other insane news.
[00:19:55.852 --> 00:19:57.693]  Again, these stacks of news are not props.
[00:19:58.534 --> 00:20:00.775]  Every one of these is an incredible stack.
[00:20:01.876 --> 00:20:03.317]  Most of it good news, by the way.
[00:20:03.617 --> 00:20:04.838]  Some of it really scary news.
[00:20:05.859 --> 00:20:08.021]  Russia's moving nuclear weapons around all over the place.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.363]  So much is happening to the economy, more bank runs, we'll get to all that.
[00:20:12.423 --> 00:20:15.745]  But also, no more antsy-pantsy.
[00:20:16.886 --> 00:20:23.312]  Multiple countries in Europe, led by Italy, ban so-called insect flour in food.
[00:20:23.392 --> 00:20:26.955]  It's not insect flour, it's toxic chitin.
[00:20:29.898 --> 00:20:30.718]  There is so much.
[00:20:30.818 --> 00:20:35.883]  Cuban migrants flying to Key West on a motorized hand glider, God bless them, trying to get away from tyranny.
[00:20:38.476 --> 00:20:42.419]  They're rolling out new mRNA shots with a bunch of lies and propaganda attached to it.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.142]  I want to comment on all these attempts to ban TikTok.
[00:20:47.623 --> 00:20:51.465]  We have a bunch of Democrat states trying to pass laws that take people's children as young as seven.
[00:20:52.006 --> 00:20:56.249]  If the parents don't want their child sterilized, the state claims the child can make the decision for themselves.
[00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:58.530]  The end of parental rights, what a sick cult.
[00:20:58.891 --> 00:21:01.733]  Big stack of news on that around the world, not just here.
[00:21:03.697 --> 00:21:16.004]  And then I mentioned this yesterday but ran out of time and I'm kind of glad I did because more video came out since last night as defense attorneys get more and more of the 42,000 hours from Jan 6.
[00:21:16.224 --> 00:21:18.245]  I know all you know it was staged.
[00:21:18.285 --> 00:21:31.452]  I know all you know it's a police state action, a false flag, but we don't just have Ray Epstein going to the building and telling the commission, this January 6 commission, that he quote orchestrated it.
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.882]  We now have three new groups of idiots.
[00:21:37.182 --> 00:21:38.003]  Go, go, go!
[00:21:38.123 --> 00:21:38.803]  Help them up!
[00:21:39.104 --> 00:21:39.884]  Push them up!
[00:21:40.404 --> 00:21:42.286]  New leaked January 6 footage shows D.C.
[00:21:42.326 --> 00:21:46.328]  Metro cops, not the Capitol Police, but the D.C.
[00:21:46.368 --> 00:21:49.950]  Police, encouraging people to go towards the Capitol and into the Capitol.
[00:21:51.111 --> 00:21:54.093]  And then it ties into all this new footage that's even more insane.
[00:21:55.594 --> 00:22:04.009]   Dirty cops, dirty media revealed undercover police helps steal police riot shields We've got all that video too.
[00:22:03.828 --> 00:22:08.948]  through the doors of broken glass and led the break-in. Wow.
[00:22:08.948 --> 00:22:13.508]   20 confirmed incidents and operations. The dozens of FBI agents, feds, and state
[00:22:13.508 --> 00:22:17.868]   operatives who infiltrated the Trump crowds on January 6th at the U.S. Capitol and led
[00:22:17.868 --> 00:22:24.538]   the protest. Man, I wish I would have got there a little earlier to stop them. We've
[00:22:24.538 --> 00:22:31.908]   got all that video too. It is a whopper of a day today. And then, more on Trump.
[00:22:32.317 --> 00:22:32.937]  Stay tuned.
[00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:36.258]  James O'Keefe says he has insiders in the Manhattan D.A.
[00:22:36.278 --> 00:22:37.459]  brag case against Trump.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.961]  Trump grand jury reconvenes today amid mounting expectations.
[00:22:44.722 --> 00:22:49.063]  Video analyst claims the Bushes are running the Sanders presidential campaign.
[00:22:49.123 --> 00:22:50.644]  Well, I don't need to have an analyst say that.
[00:22:51.184 --> 00:22:51.604]  They are.
[00:22:53.245 --> 00:22:55.286]  Alex Jones fears Trump assassination by Deep State.
[00:22:58.914 --> 00:23:01.156]  Alex Jones for Trump assassination by Deep State Newsweek.
[00:23:01.276 --> 00:23:02.637]  I'm sick of this slug.
[00:23:03.438 --> 00:23:04.979]  Let somebody assassinate him.
[00:23:05.419 --> 00:23:07.160]  It should have happened a long time ago.
[00:23:09.342 --> 00:23:13.325]  Says Frankie Provenzo.
[00:23:17.989 --> 00:23:20.110]  That's just some of what's coming up on that front.
[00:23:21.091 --> 00:23:23.613]  So, start your engines ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:23.653 --> 00:23:24.854]  I gave each caller a minute.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.422]  And we got to over 20 callers in one hour.
[00:23:30.942 --> 00:23:34.686]  We're about to take hour after hour after hour of calls and cover news in between it.
[00:23:35.706 --> 00:23:38.209]  The toll-free number to join us on this live Monday edition is 877-789-2539.
[00:23:38.229 --> 00:23:38.529]  877-789-2539.
[00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.669]  877-789-Alex.
[00:23:38.689 --> 00:23:41.031]  And let me just ask this one thing in the first 20 calls or so.
[00:23:40.890 --> 00:24:00.409]  to get on as well.
[00:24:00.727 --> 00:24:17.459]  But I want to give first-time callers a shot here, so make sure you make sure they got a clean phone line, and they're a first-time caller, and I'm going to put you on air, and I want to hear from you on Trump, on 2024, on the state of all this, and what you think about Trump.
[00:24:17.499 --> 00:24:18.480]  We're not censoring.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.921]  We're not screening.
[00:24:20.401 --> 00:24:21.602]  We're not filtering.
[00:24:22.002 --> 00:24:23.664]  We are talking to the people.
[00:24:24.716 --> 00:24:26.216]  All I ask is a clean phone line.
[00:24:27.157 --> 00:24:30.017]  If you want to tell us where you're calling from, that's interesting, but that's it.
[00:24:30.658 --> 00:24:32.098]  And you're on the air to millions of people.
[00:24:32.518 --> 00:24:33.699]  I want to hear from you today.
[00:24:33.719 --> 00:24:37.440]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.180]  877-789-2539.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.941]  The websites are Band.Video, InfoWars.com.
[00:24:43.261 --> 00:24:48.202]  The way to share the Band.Video link with a link that isn't being blocked right now is MadMaxWorld.TV.
[00:24:48.603 --> 00:24:49.543]  MadMaxWorld.TV.
[00:24:50.968 --> 00:24:52.369]  All right, we are back live.
[00:24:52.469 --> 00:24:53.750]  Loading the phone lines up.
[00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.331]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[00:24:55.391 --> 00:24:58.073]  I've got a bunch of other news I'm going to be hitting as well.
[00:24:58.634 --> 00:25:00.275]  But a couple of important news items.
[00:25:00.936 --> 00:25:04.418]  Here's the catch-22 of InfoWars funding ourselves and staying on air.
[00:25:05.399 --> 00:25:06.920]  Providing you great products at the same time.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.041]  A win-win situation.
[00:25:08.441 --> 00:25:13.705]  A 360 win, the term I coined many years ago.
[00:25:16.087 --> 00:25:17.228]  We get into bankruptcy.
[00:25:17.468 --> 00:25:18.469]  We dig our way out.
[00:25:20.414 --> 00:25:22.077]  90% chance it's going to be successful.
[00:25:22.097 --> 00:25:24.179]  100% chance it will be financially support.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.143]  But then, they only have a small budget to order product.
[00:25:28.085 --> 00:25:31.229]  So, they only got 10,000 tubes.
[00:25:31.609 --> 00:25:33.812]  I think 12,000 tubes of the new turmeric toothpaste.
[00:25:34.413 --> 00:25:35.415]  It's almost sold out.
[00:25:35.915 --> 00:25:37.577]  It'll take a month to get more back in.
[00:25:39.465 --> 00:25:43.588]  They already sold out once of the Full Spectrum CBD oil, one of the top brands in the country.
[00:25:44.369 --> 00:25:45.610]  We have to put a purchase order in.
[00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:46.690]  It's about to sell out.
[00:25:46.951 --> 00:25:49.272]  It's 50% off what it sells for in stores.
[00:25:49.633 --> 00:25:54.596]  So good for your brain, your neurological system, your bones, your joints, everything.
[00:25:54.656 --> 00:25:57.218]  Get your CBD oil at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:25:57.538 --> 00:25:58.139]  It's selling out.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.161]  And then I'm in the Catch-22 problem of not having product to sell.
[00:26:03.081 --> 00:26:06.243]  We're going to sell out soon to the Ultimate Bone Broth, sold out for over two years.
[00:26:06.723 --> 00:26:09.024]  The prebiotic, we got a very small limited order of it.
[00:26:09.384 --> 00:26:10.364]  It's close to selling out.
[00:26:10.444 --> 00:26:11.365]  And here's another example.
[00:26:13.406 --> 00:26:16.327]  I had the idea years ago but never did it, but I thought it was the right time.
[00:26:16.347 --> 00:26:18.528]  So the crew made a great design of red, white, and blue.
[00:26:18.708 --> 00:26:19.708]  Alex Jones for President 2024.
[00:26:19.848 --> 00:26:21.069]  Infowars.com on the back.
[00:26:23.152 --> 00:26:29.397]  And I told, because you're in a bankruptcy, you have a CRO manager who's a nice guy and smart, but I said, I'd order 15,000 of that shirt.
[00:26:29.417 --> 00:26:31.699]  It's going to be a limited edition shirt.
[00:26:32.319 --> 00:26:37.283]  It's got a little bit of a markup on it for fundraising purposes, but it's high quality fabric, looks great, navy blue.
[00:26:38.044 --> 00:26:39.685]  I said, I would get 15,000 shirts.
[00:26:39.725 --> 00:26:40.566]  They ordered 5,000.
[00:26:41.366 --> 00:26:42.847]  They'll be sold out today.
[00:26:43.528 --> 00:26:46.590]  There's only about a thousand left at InfoWars.org.
[00:26:47.551 --> 00:26:56.569]   And the way we do it in bankruptcy is, We don't do back orders even though more shirts can come in in two weeks if we order them today, which they're doing.
[00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.172]  We just put you on a wait list and charge you when the shirt comes in.
[00:27:01.073 --> 00:27:01.974]  So there's my frustration.
[00:27:02.294 --> 00:27:03.255]  We hit the zeitgeist.
[00:27:03.315 --> 00:27:05.097]  We'd probably sell 100,000 of these things.
[00:27:06.238 --> 00:27:07.739]  It's a one month only limited edition.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.541]  It would fund all of our issues.
[00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:10.722]  All of our problems would be solved.
[00:27:11.042 --> 00:27:13.164]  But because we're such in a hole, we could buy 5,000.
[00:27:16.624 --> 00:27:18.304]  So, if you want the shirt, get it.
[00:27:18.605 --> 00:27:19.905]  It'll go on a wait list by tomorrow.
[00:27:19.945 --> 00:27:21.025]  We have the shirts right now.
[00:27:21.345 --> 00:27:29.087]  It'll be two weeks or so, till we get more of the shirts, because we don't ship something, we don't sell something, unless we have it in stock.
[00:27:30.528 --> 00:27:31.528]  So that's my frustration.
[00:27:31.568 --> 00:27:37.550]  People were hungry for shirts, we've been sold out for months, it's back, and if we just had the damn thing in stock, we would get out of the hole!
[00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:42.211]  And I'm not complaining, but that's how this frustration has been.
[00:27:43.877 --> 00:27:50.222]  So if you want the shirt, it's available at InfowarStore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:27:50.362 --> 00:27:52.223]  And then please keep supporting us.
[00:27:52.263 --> 00:27:57.527]  You don't forget, if you don't order it today and it's sold out and says it's on a wait list, go ahead and order it.
[00:27:57.587 --> 00:28:00.429]  You'll get charged when it comes in and when they ship it to you.
[00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:14.515]   So I'll say this, the bankruptcies helped us run the system better, get our customer service up to top notch again, and really Get rid of a lot of bills we found were unnecessary, so we're as lean and mean as you can get.
[00:28:14.535 --> 00:28:18.259]  The broadcast is at fighting weight right now, and I want to thank you for your support.
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.465]  But whatever products we've got, you need to get them because it funds the operation, plus they're amazing products.
[00:28:25.165 --> 00:28:34.051]  For people that don't know what Nitric Boost does and the compounds in that for your heart, your body, your energy, everything else, and people really love it because of the libido effect, especially for men.
[00:28:34.992 --> 00:28:36.593]  We've got that in stock, I would get that.
[00:28:36.693 --> 00:28:38.915]  And what ties in with it is Ashwagandha gummy.
[00:28:39.555 --> 00:28:41.737]  It's got a bunch of key minerals and vitamins with it.
[00:28:42.177 --> 00:28:51.064]  But what Ashwagandha does for your mental well-being is what we sell it as, but it really is, quite frankly, a powerful mental enhancement.
[00:28:51.584 --> 00:28:56.525]  And then we have the pills that have the concentrated black pepper piperdine in it.
[00:28:57.405 --> 00:28:59.186]  Because that doesn't taste good, so it's in a pill.
[00:28:59.546 --> 00:29:01.626]  This is amazing as well and helps you lose weight.
[00:29:02.847 --> 00:29:04.847]  So does the last few bottles we've got left.
[00:29:04.927 --> 00:29:05.727]  We've got to reorder it.
[00:29:07.047 --> 00:29:09.408]  And that's X7 Diet Force.
[00:29:10.128 --> 00:29:11.068]  That's an amazing product.
[00:29:11.088 --> 00:29:12.209]  It helps you naturally lose weight.
[00:29:12.729 --> 00:29:14.269]  It's available at Infowarsware.com.
[00:29:14.289 --> 00:29:15.869]  There's like 2,000 bottles left of that.
[00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.621]   The good news is, We are barely in the black.
[00:29:20.842 --> 00:29:21.603]  We're not in the red.
[00:29:21.903 --> 00:29:24.466]  And X3 comes in next week.
[00:29:25.267 --> 00:29:27.149]  And X2 in about a month.
[00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:29.432]  And then Turbo Force in about two weeks.
[00:29:30.113 --> 00:29:33.397]  And then a bunch of other stuff that's been sold out for a long time.
[00:29:34.261 --> 00:29:41.529]  It's going to be here, and then I intend to not just try to have InfoWars operate the way we've been the last few years in just a stabilization survival mode.
[00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.872]  We want to go cover Bilderberg this year.
[00:29:44.112 --> 00:29:45.474]  We want to go cover all the events.
[00:29:45.614 --> 00:29:47.115]  We want to put our reporters in the field.
[00:29:47.456 --> 00:29:49.518]  We want to hire back a bunch of people we had to lay off.
[00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:54.464]  We want to go into war mode and be on the offense, not just in defense mode.
[00:29:55.691 --> 00:29:56.952]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:29:57.072 --> 00:29:59.734]  A great product we do have is the Ultimate Krill Oil.
[00:30:00.094 --> 00:30:05.118]  What it does for your brain, your blood, your heart, your cardiovascular, your mind, is over the top.
[00:30:05.178 --> 00:30:10.502]  Highest grade fish oil and krill oil, both available at infowarestore.com.
[00:30:10.582 --> 00:30:11.723]  And finally, and I'm done plugging.
[00:30:12.204 --> 00:30:12.604]  I've been good.
[00:30:12.624 --> 00:30:16.207]  I've been up to play for like five minutes in the first hour and maybe once at the end of the show.
[00:30:16.267 --> 00:30:23.893]  Most radio shows, you know, end of the break, out of the break, plug, plug, plug, because, you know, people don't listen to the ads anymore and talk radio.
[00:30:24.033 --> 00:30:25.334]  So everybody knows that for a decade.
[00:30:27.093 --> 00:30:37.518]  We have high-quality, storable food, the entire catalog of MyPatriot ready to ship to you, and the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System that is the highest-rated, gravity-fed system out there.
[00:30:37.579 --> 00:30:38.619]  It's the highest-rated.
[00:30:39.119 --> 00:30:44.002]  There's five other companies out of over a hundred gravity-fed filters that have the same rating.
[00:30:44.082 --> 00:30:46.163]  The best, highest rating, best there is.
[00:30:46.823 --> 00:30:58.103]   They're stainless steel, they're fancy, they got all this stuff on them, and they're still half the price of the leading competitor because MyPatriot has the same philosophy of me.
[00:30:58.103 --> 00:31:01.103]   They went out over 15 years ago and began developing the filter.
[00:31:01.103 --> 00:31:03.103]  It's been out for 6-7 years. It's a best seller.
[00:31:03.103 --> 00:31:06.103]  They just don't double charge you for it.
[00:31:06.103 --> 00:31:10.103]   You need the Alexa Pure Pro, the Alexa Pure Breeze air filter.
[00:31:10.103 --> 00:31:12.103]  The replacement filters are there.
[00:31:12.184 --> 00:31:14.406]  Everything is at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:14.846 --> 00:31:23.253]  And so are one-year food supplies, six-month food supplies, three-month food supplies, four-week food supplies that are the very best out there and the highest quality and the lowest price you're going to find.
[00:31:23.713 --> 00:31:27.216]  InfoWarsTore.com or PrepareWithAlex.com.
[00:31:28.157 --> 00:31:30.459]  Now, the other prepare site is not me.
[00:31:30.519 --> 00:31:31.340]  It's not InfoWars.
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.101]  We were working with other folks before.
[00:31:33.121 --> 00:31:33.721]  We're not now.
[00:31:34.142 --> 00:31:35.703]  The only sites to go to to get the best deal.
[00:31:35.743 --> 00:31:37.565]  By the way, it's 5% off the storable food right now.
[00:31:37.845 --> 00:31:38.846]  Nobody else has got that either.
[00:31:40.746 --> 00:31:43.968]  Is preparewithalex.com or infowarestore.com.
[00:31:44.068 --> 00:31:48.831]  Preparewithalex.com takes you right to the sub page of infowarestore.com.
[00:31:49.711 --> 00:31:50.031]  Okay.
[00:31:50.972 --> 00:31:51.652]  I'm done plugging.
[00:31:53.533 --> 00:31:55.514]  Let's get into the facts here now.
[00:31:56.635 --> 00:32:01.478]  I'm going to come back, take calls on Trump and 2024 and what's happening in the world.
[00:32:01.798 --> 00:32:03.199]  And do you support Trump or DeSantis?
[00:32:03.239 --> 00:32:04.239]  Or what do you support?
[00:32:04.279 --> 00:32:05.660]  What's your plan to take the country back?
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:06.961]  That's next segment.
[00:32:06.981 --> 00:32:08.442]  But let me tell you what else is coming up.
[00:32:10.506 --> 00:32:19.793]  Minnesota lawmakers advanced transgender reps legislation that could strip custody from parents who don't support child being sterilized.
[00:32:21.314 --> 00:32:27.879]  Arizona Family Dollar employee charged with murder after allegedly gunning down cereal shoplifter who punched him in the face.
[00:32:29.793 --> 00:32:32.013]  Minnesota advances trans-refugee bill.
[00:32:32.173 --> 00:32:36.074]  Opponents say it would strip custody from non-consenting parents.
[00:32:36.174 --> 00:32:38.115]  You must consent to the state sterilizing your child.
[00:32:38.615 --> 00:32:42.355]  GOP bill would protect parents who refuse to transition their child's gender.
[00:32:42.415 --> 00:32:42.996]  Fox News.
[00:32:44.656 --> 00:32:45.516]  And a whole lot more.
[00:32:45.556 --> 00:32:49.637]  Tennessee legislature passes ban on gender transition health care for minors.
[00:32:50.257 --> 00:32:55.198]  Kentucky governor says he's going to veto a bill protecting minor children from being sterilized by the state.
[00:32:56.713 --> 00:32:59.135]  Idaho signs transgender bathroom ban.
[00:33:00.215 --> 00:33:02.337]  School faces $5,000 fine per infraction.
[00:33:03.337 --> 00:33:11.622]  I've got public schools around the country where they're forcing elementary students, middle students, and high school students into transgender bathrooms.
[00:33:11.743 --> 00:33:14.364]  Everyone is in the same bathroom at the same time.
[00:33:14.744 --> 00:33:19.107]  They're telling children it's a hate crime if they don't strip down in front of the opposite sex.
[00:33:19.768 --> 00:33:22.870]  What a sick cult of evil garbage.
[00:33:23.752 --> 00:33:26.194]  Remember the Surgeon General under Clinton, Jocelyn Elders?
[00:33:26.794 --> 00:33:30.156]  Reach down and help the babies masturbate.
[00:33:30.657 --> 00:33:33.638]  I mean, these people are out of their minds.
[00:33:33.699 --> 00:33:34.479]  That's coming up.
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.802]  Again, I mentioned bans on making children eat toxic bugs.
[00:33:39.242 --> 00:33:39.883]  That's coming up.
[00:33:39.903 --> 00:33:42.865]  A bunch of news on electric cars and the power grab.
[00:33:43.525 --> 00:33:47.888]  Russia to station nuclear arms in Belarus, says Putin.
[00:33:49.246 --> 00:33:56.792]  Two dead, 17 nearly suffocated in railroad car smuggling event in Uvalde, Texas with the poor illegal aliens.
[00:33:57.432 --> 00:34:00.154]  But it hardly ever hits the news because the left defends the smugglers.
[00:34:00.955 --> 00:34:03.577]  And so much more today.
[00:34:04.057 --> 00:34:06.239]  It is a jam-packed broadcast.
[00:34:06.619 --> 00:34:07.780]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.721]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[00:34:10.302 --> 00:34:10.782]  Stay with us.
[00:34:12.203 --> 00:34:14.745]  It's a whole new ballgame in the world.
[00:34:15.205 --> 00:34:16.807]  World governments out in the open.
[00:34:18.462 --> 00:34:22.565]  Everybody from Elon Musk to Tucker Carlson's fighting it.
[00:34:25.067 --> 00:34:27.989]  While you tune in to Bill Maher, he sounds like Alex Jones now.
[00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:38.116]  Because the listeners of this broadcast spread the word over the last 27, 28 years.
[00:34:38.756 --> 00:34:45.721]  And the enemy credits this broadcast as they've tracked it back to most of the opposition that they have faced.
[00:34:47.011 --> 00:35:02.882]  And I talked to a very prominent lawyer who's brought forward a lot of big lawsuits and a lot of big whistleblowers two weeks ago off air and he said they got a bunch of foundation documents from the top of the system and that they said InfoWars was their number one enemy in Alex Jones.
[00:35:03.382 --> 00:35:04.363]  I am so proud of that.
[00:35:04.823 --> 00:35:11.448]  That they were able to track back almost all the original opposition that triggered the domino effect against them to this show.
[00:35:12.523 --> 00:35:14.605]  That's why they hate us so much, because they hate you.
[00:35:15.125 --> 00:35:29.538]  And when Trump and MTG and Congressman Gates say, they're not after Trump, they're not after me, they're after you, they've got to get through us to get to you, that's absolutely true.
[00:35:30.939 --> 00:35:37.265]  You look at the policies of the globalists, it is to bankrupt you, it is to destroy you, it is to annihilate you and your family.
[00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:39.951]  The globalists are at war with us.
[00:35:40.932 --> 00:35:45.355]  And so you'd have to be a fool not to support what Trump's saying and doing.
[00:35:45.395 --> 00:35:47.496]  It doesn't mean we're not upset with him about the poison shots.
[00:35:48.817 --> 00:35:56.662]  But now we're going to open the phones up and give each caller 60 seconds, which is a nice piece of time.
[00:35:57.443 --> 00:35:58.864]  And that's how we get to everybody.
[00:35:59.224 --> 00:36:00.405]  That's how we get to a lot of you.
[00:36:02.106 --> 00:36:05.128]  So I want to turn, we have 12 people on the phone line system.
[00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:12.685]   And as soon as you hear a caller hang up, You call in and we're going to bam, bam, bam, take a ton of your calls.
[00:36:13.326 --> 00:36:16.447]  All right, first up is Elizabeth in Ohio.
[00:36:16.507 --> 00:36:17.587]  Elizabeth, you're on the air.
[00:36:17.987 --> 00:36:18.668]  What's your view on 2024?
[00:36:18.748 --> 00:36:26.871]  On 2024, first and foremost, I'd like to thank God and I'd like to thank God for you.
[00:36:26.931 --> 00:36:27.731]  Thank you.
[00:36:27.751 --> 00:36:32.893]  Second, for 2024, if Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:36:32.993 --> 00:36:34.413]  runs, I'm all in.
[00:36:34.854 --> 00:36:35.594]  Love his work.
[00:36:36.394 --> 00:36:38.435]  But if he's not, then Trump.
[00:36:39.758 --> 00:36:42.520]  So, Kennedy first, Trump second.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:52.566]  I agree with you, and I think Trump should really, like he said he would do six years ago and didn't do it, or now, six years ago, he should have made Kennedy part of his cabinet.
[00:36:53.106 --> 00:36:55.988]  He should bring Kennedy to his rallies.
[00:36:57.329 --> 00:36:58.090]  Exactly!
[00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:59.230]  Exactly!
[00:36:59.651 --> 00:37:07.095]  He should at least be, it should be Kennedy, then Vice President Trump, or vice versa.
[00:37:08.664 --> 00:37:11.806]  If Kennedy, I would rather have Kennedy first, Trump second.
[00:37:12.287 --> 00:37:18.211]  So, and I just say, God bless and thank you very much for taking my call.
[00:37:18.311 --> 00:37:19.171]  Thank you, Elizabeth.
[00:37:19.251 --> 00:37:20.032]  Thank you so much.
[00:37:20.432 --> 00:37:22.153]  Kurt in South Carolina, welcome.
[00:37:24.255 --> 00:37:24.815]  Thank you, sir.
[00:37:26.356 --> 00:37:29.118]  I do support Donald J. Trump for president.
[00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:43.879]  I'd also recommend that we support our constitutional minded sheriffs across this country and pray that they would form posses and join together in arresting the criminal usurpers of our country.
[00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:46.511]  You know, that's a really good point.
[00:37:46.571 --> 00:37:49.714]  The left has anti-fund all these lawless Black Lives Matter groups.
[00:37:50.314 --> 00:37:52.756]  We just need citizen defense, peaceful.
[00:37:53.517 --> 00:37:57.821]  I mean, I guess they had the term back up until after World War II, civil defense.
[00:37:57.841 --> 00:37:58.602]  They got rid of that.
[00:37:59.302 --> 00:38:05.968]  And we do need to take neighborhood watch to the next level to stabilize our societies and have our communities come together.
[00:38:06.008 --> 00:38:08.750]  And the county sheriff's the place to start constitutionally.
[00:38:10.412 --> 00:38:10.892]  Yes, sir.
[00:38:11.653 --> 00:38:12.854]  Maybe you can help push that.
[00:38:14.645 --> 00:38:16.106]  Are you liking what you're seeing from Trump?
[00:38:16.126 --> 00:38:17.387]  I think he's more hardcore than ever.
[00:38:19.168 --> 00:38:19.648]  Yes, sir.
[00:38:20.509 --> 00:38:21.409]  I'm hopeful.
[00:38:21.629 --> 00:38:22.670]  I just keep praying.
[00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:24.851]  And God bless you.
[00:38:25.592 --> 00:38:26.753]  God bless you, Kurt.
[00:38:26.873 --> 00:38:27.713]  Thank you so much.
[00:38:28.494 --> 00:38:29.494]  Cindy in Florida.
[00:38:29.514 --> 00:38:29.875]  Go ahead.
[00:38:29.935 --> 00:38:30.235]  Welcome.
[00:38:32.122 --> 00:38:34.665]  Hi Alex, thank you so much for having me on.
[00:38:34.925 --> 00:38:36.147]  We love your show.
[00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:38.309]  We've been a listener since 2009.
[00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:41.232]  I just want to encourage people to buy your book.
[00:38:41.452 --> 00:38:42.373]  It is phenomenal.
[00:38:43.194 --> 00:38:48.200]  We love The Diet Force and we have just ordered your Alex Jones for President t-shirts.
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.002]  Thank you.
[00:38:50.563 --> 00:38:51.203]  You're welcome.
[00:38:51.263 --> 00:38:55.207]   My husband and I will be voting for Trump We love Rand Paul.
[00:38:56.288 --> 00:38:59.471]  If he was on the ticket, we think that would be a dynamite duo.
[00:38:59.491 --> 00:39:00.752]  I agree.
[00:39:00.812 --> 00:39:06.076]  I think the best ticket, I endorse that, I think the best Trump vice president would be Rand Paul.
[00:39:08.104 --> 00:39:08.464]  Awesome.
[00:39:08.525 --> 00:39:09.105]  We do too.
[00:39:09.746 --> 00:39:14.650]  Just some thoughts on the shot that we know both of us are disappointed in.
[00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.111]  You know, Trump's pushing that.
[00:39:16.732 --> 00:39:19.254]  Given some thought to it, read a couple of different articles.
[00:39:19.635 --> 00:39:22.377]  You know, I think the pandemic was not on his radar.
[00:39:22.637 --> 00:39:29.960]   He was so busy doing other amazing things for the country that you know this was just not really on his radar.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.860]   Oh and he tried to get therapeutics and he did a he did I mean he bucked him a
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:38.069]   bunch he tried to he wanted to end the lockdown sooner I mean yeah and that's
[00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:43.520]   why I wish he'd just come out admit they set him up. Yes I agree with you
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:45.759]  100%.
[00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:45.470]  He needs to come out and admit that.
[00:39:45.871 --> 00:40:00.283]  I think at the time, he knew the only way to keep the country open was that he was going to have to, you know, offer up the vaccine as a solution to half the country, you know, as a way to keep this country open.
[00:40:00.624 --> 00:40:02.265]  For the other half of us, you're right.
[00:40:02.385 --> 00:40:03.967]  He did push other therapeutics.
[00:40:04.027 --> 00:40:06.469]  He was very vocal about that, encouraged that.
[00:40:07.269 --> 00:40:10.591]  Some of us were listening and some of us just tuned that part out.
[00:40:10.631 --> 00:40:16.595]  But I do think that Trump is going to be the best candidate for president in 2024.
[00:40:17.035 --> 00:40:18.055]  We are in Florida.
[00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:20.637]  We love our Governor Ron DeSantis.
[00:40:21.137 --> 00:40:26.340]  But we also are learning a lot about Ron that we did not know just over in the last couple of weeks.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.100]  All right.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.061]  Cindy, amazing points.
[00:40:28.101 --> 00:40:30.582]  Got to jump to the next person or we'll never get to all you wonderful callers.
[00:40:31.203 --> 00:40:32.564]  Let's go to Kim in Colorado.
[00:40:32.584 --> 00:40:33.144]  Thanks for calling.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.302]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[00:40:36.342 --> 00:40:37.563]  We love you and God bless you.
[00:40:37.583 --> 00:40:37.983]  God bless you.
[00:40:38.143 --> 00:40:39.484]  I just want, thank you.
[00:40:39.504 --> 00:40:47.431]  I just want to let you know that I am in one of the last red counties in Colorado, led by Lauren Bobart, who's a wonderful lover.
[00:40:47.932 --> 00:40:48.072]  Yes.
[00:40:48.332 --> 00:40:59.442]  My question is, when Biden put his hand on the Bible and promised to protect the United States from all foreign and domestic enemies, he has yet to do that.
[00:40:59.882 --> 00:41:01.464]  And I want to know why he's not arrested.
[00:41:03.223 --> 00:41:08.225]  I mean, I want to see Biden impeached, and I've been really upset at McCarthy not doing that.
[00:41:08.265 --> 00:41:10.446]  I mean, he needs to be impeached right now.
[00:41:10.506 --> 00:41:11.686]  The guy has committed all these crimes.
[00:41:11.726 --> 00:41:12.507]  I totally agree with you.
[00:41:14.167 --> 00:41:14.608]  Thank you.
[00:41:15.088 --> 00:41:16.508]  Take care of yourself, and God bless you.
[00:41:16.668 --> 00:41:17.289]  God bless you.
[00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:18.789]  Yeah, Colorado, what a great state.
[00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:19.770]  And now taken over by the left.
[00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:21.610]  Texas is being taken over, too, folks.
[00:41:22.191 --> 00:41:24.111]  Lonnie in Tennessee, thanks for calling.
[00:41:25.952 --> 00:41:27.213]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[00:41:27.233 --> 00:41:27.853]  I appreciate it.
[00:41:27.873 --> 00:41:28.573]  Appreciate you.
[00:41:29.514 --> 00:41:32.715]  My vote has got to be for Trump when he went in.
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:40.886]  He didn't know who all the swamp creatures were, and he's got a great idea who they are now.
[00:41:41.126 --> 00:41:43.248]  And look what all he did when he was in there.
[00:41:43.548 --> 00:41:44.949]  I mean, they were in his cabinet.
[00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:47.151]  He was infested with them.
[00:41:47.831 --> 00:41:51.274]  And they'd lie right to his face and throw his executive orders in the trash can.
[00:41:51.574 --> 00:41:51.914]  I agree.
[00:41:51.954 --> 00:41:52.595]  And now he says...
[00:41:53.772 --> 00:41:55.813]  It's either the Deep State or us, which is totally true.
[00:41:55.833 --> 00:41:57.955]  And I'll say this, I know people that know Trump very well.
[00:41:58.495 --> 00:41:59.176]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:41:59.296 --> 00:42:03.819]  They say in long meetings, he's completely different now and completely pissed.
[00:42:04.379 --> 00:42:05.920]  That's why Jared has creeped away.
[00:42:07.341 --> 00:42:08.622]  Yep.
[00:42:08.682 --> 00:42:14.886]  You know, I remember the song, he's saying, he's in bed with a goblin, kissing a goblin.
[00:42:15.146 --> 00:42:16.407]  Well, these are swamp goblins.
[00:42:16.807 --> 00:42:17.868]  He didn't do none of them.
[00:42:17.908 --> 00:42:19.749]  He was infested with goblins.
[00:42:20.379 --> 00:42:22.821]  And I think he's going to go goblin hunting when he gets out there.
[00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:31.266]  And I do have to say that it's not a man that's going to save us from this dark, deep hole we're in.
[00:42:31.486 --> 00:42:32.607]  It's the Almighty God.
[00:42:33.187 --> 00:42:41.813]  And the very man that's out there saying that Jesus Christ is better than he in front of the whole world is the vote that I'm going for.
[00:42:42.299 --> 00:42:42.919]  Absolutely.
[00:42:42.979 --> 00:42:44.660]  Thank you so much, sir, for the call.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:45.760]  We're doing good.
[00:42:45.841 --> 00:42:47.241]  Told you I'm taking a lot of calls.
[00:42:47.961 --> 00:42:49.602]  Let's talk to Jordan in California.
[00:42:49.622 --> 00:42:50.582]  Jordan, thanks for calling.
[00:42:51.883 --> 00:42:52.363]  Hey, Alex.
[00:42:52.483 --> 00:42:53.244]  God bless you, man.
[00:42:53.444 --> 00:42:53.824]  God bless you.
[00:42:53.844 --> 00:42:54.404]  I'm calling.
[00:42:54.704 --> 00:43:02.968]  I'll vote for any Republican who gets the nomination, but one name that you didn't mention is Vivek Ramaswamy, who's running.
[00:43:03.008 --> 00:43:04.988]  He wants to end the Department of Education.
[00:43:06.149 --> 00:43:10.050]  And one thing that Trump is talking about right now is universal school choice.
[00:43:11.778 --> 00:43:23.286]  Yeah, I think that might be a bit of a poison pill in that Corey DeAngelis, who's probably the main proponent of school choice right now, he worked for the UNESCO Inclusive Policy Lab.
[00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:26.609]  I'm sure he's still got ties to that.
[00:43:26.919 --> 00:43:32.439]   I'm worried that school choice and funding private schools from government taxpayer dollars
[00:43:32.439 --> 00:43:37.399]   is going to turn into a bit of a conflict of interest. It's going to increase tuition.
[00:43:37.399 --> 00:43:44.758]   I mean, it could bring it up in programs that private schools don't want. One person who's been
[00:43:44.758 --> 00:43:51.479]   a lot including Bovee is James Lindsay. And I think it'd be really smart if you reached out
[00:43:51.479 --> 00:43:52.359]  to James Lindsay.
[00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:55.713]  He exposed CRT, he exposed wokeism in the schools.
[00:43:55.753 --> 00:43:56.534]  No, that's a good idea.
[00:43:56.614 --> 00:43:58.476]  I know who he is, we should get him on.
[00:43:58.556 --> 00:43:59.257]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:00.599 --> 00:44:01.199]  I know this.
[00:44:04.983 --> 00:44:07.226]  The Indian individual, how do you pronounce his name, Vivek?
[00:44:09.181 --> 00:44:10.022]  Very well spoken.
[00:44:10.042 --> 00:44:10.923]  Has a good vibe.
[00:44:11.483 --> 00:44:12.324]  Incredible speaker.
[00:44:12.384 --> 00:44:13.605]  Everything he says I agree with.
[00:44:14.365 --> 00:44:16.347]  He's just so new on the scene.
[00:44:17.648 --> 00:44:18.809]  You know, it's kind of like the Santas.
[00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:20.350]  Like, what do we really know about the Santas?
[00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:23.093]  Well, compared to Vivek, we know a lot about the Santas.
[00:44:23.113 --> 00:44:25.555]  So, I'm glad Vivek's running.
[00:44:25.595 --> 00:44:26.996]  I'm glad he's injecting good ideas.
[00:44:28.077 --> 00:44:29.318]  And I like the guy a lot.
[00:44:29.338 --> 00:44:30.039]  I like what I'm seeing.
[00:44:30.059 --> 00:44:31.380]  But I just don't know enough about him yet.
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:33.321]  I'm a Rand Paul guy.
[00:44:33.361 --> 00:44:34.642]  I think Rand Paul should be the VP.
[00:44:34.662 --> 00:44:35.923]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:44:35.743 --> 00:45:00.663]  Stay with us.

[00:45:49.729 --> 00:45:56.529]   The communist tabloid, The Global Times, explains China's global civilization initiative
[00:45:56.529 --> 00:46:03.329]   as the third major global initiative presented by China after the Global Development Initiative and the Global
[00:46:03.329 --> 00:46:04.528]  Security Initiative.
[00:46:04.957 --> 00:46:18.768]   This narrative deceptively claims the initiative calls for respect for the diversity of civilizations The Chinese government has clamped down hard, putting in place restrictive rules and reforming the way Hong Kong is run.
[00:46:19.248 --> 00:46:23.991]  MPs who are directly elected by the people will also have less power.
[00:46:24.711 --> 00:46:49.827]   Upholding the common values of humanity in pursuing peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, If there is no threat to Americans, if there is no threat to our data, privacy, security, why did an internal memo from TikTok corporate headquarters explicitly coach senior management to, quote, downplay the parent company ByteDance?
[00:46:50.408 --> 00:46:56.892]  Why, if you had nothing to hide, would you need to downplay the association with ByteDance in China?
[00:46:57.674 --> 00:46:59.735]  Congressman, I have not seen this memo.
[00:47:00.156 --> 00:47:04.999]  And promoting robust international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation.
[00:47:05.059 --> 00:47:09.282]  Hunter Biden's business associate sent over a million dollars to three of your family members.
[00:47:09.382 --> 00:47:10.823]  Any reaction to that report?
[00:47:11.524 --> 00:47:19.249]  House Oversight says they've got bank records showing a Chinese energy company paying three Biden family members through a third party.
[00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:20.670]  What were they paid for?
[00:47:21.596 --> 00:47:24.138]  Look, I'm just not going to respond to that from here.
[00:47:24.338 --> 00:47:30.904]  He's telling us that he paid around $11,000 to complete this trip that's either paid to a cartel or different human smuggling groups.
[00:47:31.204 --> 00:47:39.151]  But he just arrived here in Texas, once again just highlighting that this sector is leading the nation in those illegal crossings from Chinese nationals.
[00:47:39.351 --> 00:47:44.256]  The emerging BRICS countries quickly fell in line behind President Xi's illusion.
[00:47:44.696 --> 00:47:49.318]  I totally agree that the world order, the way it is built today, doesn't make any sense.
[00:47:49.698 --> 00:47:56.980]  It's not in line with the economic powers like India, Brazil or Germany.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.822]  They don't have a massive role in the international order.
[00:48:05.343 --> 00:48:19.413]  We have lost a large part of humankind to the pandemic because we were all selfish.
[00:48:19.793 --> 00:48:21.254]  We were not willing to share.
[00:48:21.634 --> 00:48:27.198]  We were not willing to use the global institutions to deliver responses to different parts of the world.
[00:48:27.558 --> 00:48:28.659]  We have lost people.
[00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:33.402]  Now, how much more bloodshed do we need to understand that the transition is upon us?
[00:48:33.522 --> 00:48:40.050]  South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that he fully agrees with Xi's initiative.
[00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:47.718]  South Africa is grateful to the People's Republic of China for its support throughout the pandemic.
[00:48:48.779 --> 00:48:57.848]  And particularly for working to ensure that Africa has greater access to COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:48:57.968 --> 00:49:02.552]  Nothing can change our friendship of steel.
[00:49:03.292 --> 00:49:14.703]  While UN water-carrying Serbian President Aleksandar Vukic also said that nation should uphold the principles of equality, mutual learning, dialogue and inclusiveness.
[00:49:15.063 --> 00:49:23.372]  Equality from a Chinese government that is conducting a mass genocidal sterilization campaign on its citizens known as the Uyghurs.
[00:49:23.766 --> 00:49:35.696]  Before eating, we have to praise, say that we are grateful to the country, we are very grateful for China's Communist Party, and we are grateful for Xi Jinping.
[00:49:36.056 --> 00:49:39.999]  This desperate man says he and his wife and children are starving.
[00:49:40.139 --> 00:49:44.363]  Uyghurs were barely allowed to leave their homes during the COVID-19 lockdown.
[00:49:46.064 --> 00:49:57.512]  Mutual learning from a cover-up of a global lab leak that has killed millions and damaged millions more through the initial virus and its subsequent vaccine.
[00:49:58.073 --> 00:50:09.600]   As you note, Brett, the FBI has for quite some time now assessed That the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan.
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.021]  And dialogue and inclusiveness.
[00:50:12.502 --> 00:50:25.409]  From a country where of the over 100 foreign journalists that took part in the Foreign Correspondents Club of China survey, 99% said that they felt working conditions did not meet international standards.
[00:50:25.949 --> 00:50:27.410]  Hey Barry, call the consulate now!
[00:50:28.803 --> 00:50:37.709]  Once the layers of propaganda are stripped off, that even American media gleefully engages in, Xi's speech is laid bare for what it is.
[00:50:38.029 --> 00:50:45.554]  The announcement of the impending emergence of a new world order, carefully constructed by globalist think tanks for decades.
[00:50:46.214 --> 00:50:47.355]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:50:50.477 --> 00:50:56.656]   I don't wanna see 'em kissing goblins ingratiating goblins
[00:50:56.656 --> 00:51:00.537]   in bed with a goblin I don't wanna see 'em kissing goblins
[00:51:00.537 --> 00:51:04.457]   succubus goblins ingratiating goblins
[00:51:05.652 --> 00:51:11.596]  I don't understand kissing goblins, shitting goblins, in bed with a goblin.
[00:51:11.615 --> 00:51:13.615]  Goblins, and bad with a gob.
[00:51:13.615 --> 00:51:15.115]  I don't wanna see him.
[00:51:15.115 --> 00:51:20.115]   Kissing goblins, and shitting goblins, and bad with a gob.
[00:51:20.115 --> 00:51:22.115]  That's it.
[00:51:22.115 --> 00:51:22.615]  Dump it.
[00:51:22.615 --> 00:51:25.615]   Charging into a goblin's nest, some goblin vomit,
[00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:27.615]  slop, and blood on it.
[00:51:27.615 --> 00:51:30.115]  Especially up to his ankles.
[00:51:30.115 --> 00:51:33.115]   Trump charging into a goblin's nest, some goblin vomit,
[00:51:33.115 --> 00:51:34.115]  slop.
[00:51:34.115 --> 00:51:36.115]  Goblin vomit, slop.
[00:51:36.115 --> 00:51:38.115]  I'm not expecting him to not get bird slop.
[00:51:38.115 --> 00:51:42.115]   Kissing goblins, and shitting goblins, and shitting goblins.
[00:51:42.115 --> 00:51:46.115]   Give us one goblin, bad with a gob.
[00:51:46.115 --> 00:51:50.115]   Kissing goblins, shitting goblins.
[00:51:50.115 --> 00:51:53.115]  I just don't wanna catch him in bed.
[00:51:53.115 --> 00:51:55.115]  Bad with a gob.
[00:51:55.115 --> 00:51:57.115]  Bad with a gob.
[00:51:57.115 --> 00:51:59.115]  Bad with a gob.
[00:51:59.115 --> 00:52:01.115]  I just don't wanna catch him in bed.
[00:52:01.115 --> 00:52:03.115]  Bad with a gob.
[00:52:03.115 --> 00:52:05.115]  Bad with a gob.
[00:52:05.115 --> 00:52:15.115]  [laughter]
[00:52:15.115 --> 00:52:17.115]  [scream]
[00:52:17.115 --> 00:52:19.115]  [thud]
[00:52:19.115 --> 00:52:29.115]   Well, in my view, Trump saying it's the deep state or us is not kissing goblins.
[00:52:29.221 --> 00:52:32.503]  2024 is the final battle.
[00:52:32.543 --> 00:52:33.684]  That's going to be the big one.
[00:52:35.005 --> 00:52:44.505]   If you put me back in the White House, their reign will be over and America will be a free nation once again.
[00:52:44.505 --> 00:52:48.505]  [Applause]
[00:52:48.505 --> 00:52:57.505]   Either the deep state destroys America or we destroy the deep state.
[00:52:57.901 --> 00:52:59.102]  That's the way it's gotta be.
[00:53:00.844 --> 00:53:03.025]  We're at a very pivotal point in our country.
[00:53:03.766 --> 00:53:23.087]   Either we descend into a lawless abyss of open borders, rampant killings, super hyperinflation, which is what we have right now, and not coming down, and festering corruption, Or we evict Joe Biden and the Democrats from the White House and we make America great again.
[00:53:24.548 --> 00:53:29.309]  Alright, we've opened the phones up on this Monday, March 27th, worldwide transmission.
[00:53:29.449 --> 00:53:31.950]  I did a good job, I think, in the segment we took calls.
[00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:34.810]  Took 8 calls in 11 minutes.
[00:53:35.651 --> 00:53:39.651]  I'm gonna do it again this hour and next hour, interspersed with a ton of news.
[00:53:40.192 --> 00:53:41.472]  Each caller gets about a minute.
[00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:45.112]  And then we're going to move the next person so we get to everybody.
[00:53:45.132 --> 00:53:52.317]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:53:52.337 --> 00:53:52.597]  877-789-2539.
[00:53:52.817 --> 00:53:55.379]  And let's go to Lisa in Florida.
[00:53:55.419 --> 00:53:56.560]  Lisa, thank you for calling.
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:57.161]  You're on the air.
[00:53:58.562 --> 00:53:59.883]  Hi, Alex.
[00:53:59.923 --> 00:54:06.608]  I've been listening for about three years and my husband and I both voted for Trump and plan to do it again.
[00:54:07.308 --> 00:54:08.689]  We have always supported Trump.
[00:54:09.029 --> 00:54:11.151]  He's made us all mad with some of this.
[00:54:12.232 --> 00:54:19.035]  But you know, I want to really say, and I need my minutes, no matter who gets in office, they're not going to save us.
[00:54:20.075 --> 00:54:26.737]  I hear a lot of people getting, saying we were forced and there's mandates and lockdowns and look what they're doing to us.
[00:54:27.198 --> 00:54:31.119]  I want to remind people that there's no mandate.
[00:54:31.599 --> 00:54:34.460]  There's just what you comply with and what you don't.
[00:54:35.421 --> 00:54:37.421]  You have the right to have your business open.
[00:54:37.722 --> 00:54:41.663]  You have the right to breathe air without a mask over your face.
[00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:45.193]  You have, all these are basic rights that they don't give to us.
[00:54:45.813 --> 00:54:49.677]  And for three years, I watched people give up our rights and give up mine.
[00:54:49.697 --> 00:54:54.841]  Um, you know, Anatoly Golitsyn, I just got his new book, New Eyes for Old.
[00:54:55.602 --> 00:54:57.183]  And a plant, I haven't read it yet.
[00:54:57.203 --> 00:54:58.324]  It's an incredible book.
[00:54:58.384 --> 00:54:59.725]  I read it when I was, I read it when I was 15.
[00:54:59.825 --> 00:55:01.647]  I read it again when I was about 25.
[00:55:02.228 --> 00:55:02.708]  Incredible.
[00:55:02.968 --> 00:55:03.869]  I just got it.
[00:55:03.929 --> 00:55:08.133]  But you talked yesterday about civil disobedience and we've lost our life force.
[00:55:08.669 --> 00:55:10.291]  And I just don't understand people.
[00:55:10.692 --> 00:55:19.644]  I mean, I know Trump was saying this stuff about the shots and he supports it, but people have free will and they're just giving it up by saying, look what they're doing to us.
[00:55:19.744 --> 00:55:21.066]  We got to stop saying force.
[00:55:21.727 --> 00:55:23.429]  People keep saying that all the time.
[00:55:24.431 --> 00:55:26.714]  Oh, forced and mandates and lockdowns.
[00:55:27.194 --> 00:55:29.898]  You don't have to lock down if you don't want to be locked down.
[00:55:30.419 --> 00:55:30.919]  I hear you.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:31.340]  I hear you.
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:32.281]  And I appreciate your call.
[00:55:32.301 --> 00:55:35.425]  At the same time, Trump needs to come out even stronger.
[00:55:35.466 --> 00:55:37.148]  He's starting to do it, but he needs to go further.
[00:55:37.508 --> 00:55:38.730]  On Friday, I said, hey, stop.
[00:55:39.651 --> 00:55:43.533]  Posting pictures of yourself with a baseball bat saying death and destruction if I'm indicted.
[00:55:44.053 --> 00:55:45.714]  They will blow something up and blame it on us.
[00:55:45.794 --> 00:55:46.574]  And he took it down.
[00:55:47.375 --> 00:55:48.495]  So Trump's not perfect.
[00:55:48.535 --> 00:55:49.036]  None of us are.
[00:55:49.076 --> 00:55:50.196]  We need to hold his feet to the fire.
[00:55:50.756 --> 00:55:53.598]  Let's talk to Carolyn in Canada.
[00:55:53.618 --> 00:55:54.258]  Thank you for calling.
[00:55:54.298 --> 00:55:54.598]  Go ahead.
[00:55:55.739 --> 00:55:57.760]  Thanks Alex for answering my phone call.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:58.960]  I'm a first time caller.
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:55:59.421]  Welcome.
[00:56:00.201 --> 00:56:00.581]  Thank you.
[00:56:01.101 --> 00:56:02.622]  I'm just calling.
[00:56:02.742 --> 00:56:05.463]  We in Canada are hoping for Trump to get in.
[00:56:05.503 --> 00:56:06.544]  My husband and I both are.
[00:56:07.505 --> 00:56:10.287]  Because maybe he'll put our Prime Minister in check.
[00:56:11.107 --> 00:56:13.769]  Our Prime Minister seems to be in bed with the Chinese.
[00:56:14.269 --> 00:56:16.250]  They're trying to take our firearms and all this.
[00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:20.153]  So maybe Trump will do something and put our Prime Minister into check.
[00:56:20.613 --> 00:56:21.333]  Well, absolutely.
[00:56:21.373 --> 00:56:24.815]  Trump didn't just control the borders and cut back what was happening by 95%.
[00:56:26.056 --> 00:56:27.817]  He didn't just cut back the fentanyl coming in.
[00:56:27.857 --> 00:56:29.298]  He didn't just bring jobs back.
[00:56:29.758 --> 00:56:31.139]  He didn't just turn on the pipelines.
[00:56:31.159 --> 00:56:32.880]  He didn't just create all this world peace.
[00:56:34.259 --> 00:56:37.462]  Trump also did the things that you were just now talking about.
[00:56:37.562 --> 00:56:41.545]  So, so many good things that Trump did.
[00:56:42.325 --> 00:56:43.126]  Oh, I agree with you 100%.
[00:56:43.166 --> 00:56:47.590]  As I say, our Prime Ministers, they've stopped TikTok.
[00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:50.492]  I noticed one of your calls mentioned TikTok in there.
[00:56:50.612 --> 00:56:56.236]  The government here in Canada, all their phones are not allowed to have TikTok because of the Chinese influence.
[00:56:58.618 --> 00:56:59.379]  Thank you for the call.
[00:56:59.419 --> 00:56:59.959]  Great points.
[00:57:00.519 --> 00:57:03.542]  And I want to get into TikTok and give you my view on it coming up.
[00:57:04.574 --> 00:57:06.175]  I'll do that briefly at the bottom of the hour.
[00:57:07.475 --> 00:57:20.820]  I've made some comments, but I've sat back and watched this for a long time, and at the end of the day, you can't ban TikTok if you're not going to ban what the rest of big tech is doing.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:24.501]  They're all spying on you, but for their own corporate interests.
[00:57:24.521 --> 00:57:29.063]  So I agree TikTok is doing terrible illegal things, and they've been caught doing it.
[00:57:30.344 --> 00:57:31.404]  And it's ChaiCom control.
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:35.321]  But, okay, what about all these other groups?
[00:57:35.341 --> 00:57:36.342]  They're doing the same crap.
[00:57:37.182 --> 00:57:38.603]  Oh, but then it's okay for the U.S.
[00:57:38.643 --> 00:57:39.463]  government to support it.
[00:57:40.423 --> 00:57:43.705]  Let's go to Carmela in Texas.
[00:57:43.745 --> 00:57:44.565]  Carmela, you're on the air.
[00:57:44.585 --> 00:57:45.126]  Thanks for holding.
[00:57:46.206 --> 00:57:47.687]  Hi, I'm Carmelina.
[00:57:48.007 --> 00:57:49.487]  Carmelina, I'm sorry I read your name wrong.
[00:57:49.828 --> 00:57:51.008]  Carmelina, very beautiful name.
[00:57:52.129 --> 00:57:52.469]  Thank you.
[00:57:53.369 --> 00:57:54.189]  My dad from Sotoy.
[00:57:56.207 --> 00:57:57.828]  Robert Kennedy Jr., hands down.
[00:57:58.389 --> 00:58:04.073]  I see him doing more about the 5G and the cum trails and the flow guide, and I just feel like he's a man of integrity.
[00:58:04.573 --> 00:58:08.156]  And as far as Trump, I cannot vote for him unless he admits that he made a mistake.
[00:58:09.157 --> 00:58:10.318]  He needs to find the courage.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:14.401]  Well, please elaborate.
[00:58:16.743 --> 00:58:18.264]  About Trump?
[00:58:18.784 --> 00:58:18.984]  Yes.
[00:58:19.505 --> 00:58:21.166]  Yeah, no, I just, I have issues.
[00:58:21.226 --> 00:58:28.140]   I mean, he supported all the 5G that And yeah, no, I just think he needs to find the courage.
[00:58:28.321 --> 00:58:30.723]  It's just too much ego for me.
[00:58:30.923 --> 00:58:37.889]  Well, that's another big strike against Trump is the 5G that is absolutely linked to cancer and all sorts of health problems.
[00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:43.734]  And that not just the Chinese, but any company that controls it, it can scan all your electronics.
[00:58:43.814 --> 00:58:44.855]  It can break into things.
[00:58:45.356 --> 00:58:48.298]  It makes it so easy for groups to hack and control you.
[00:58:49.179 --> 00:58:49.879]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[00:58:49.719 --> 00:58:52.778]   thing is it's going to run the robot cars and robot delivery systems on the
[00:58:52.778 --> 00:58:56.438]  roads and replace humans. So it's all about driverless cars.
[00:58:56.438 --> 00:58:59.818]   It's super bad news and I agree with you. Travis in Utah, you're on the
[00:58:59.818 --> 00:59:01.237]  air, go ahead.
[00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:09.159]   Yeah, Alex. I'll start as quick. A lot of great colors, amazing points.
[00:59:07.237 --> 00:59:16.842]  I'm really impressed with what I'm hearing and the open debate and discussion about this and who would run with Trump is really amazing to me, what we can do and what we're talking about, all the great people.
[00:59:17.322 --> 00:59:24.845]  So this goes back to like about a year ago, I called in, I got hold of Christy Lee and she was asking about, you know, who do you like, Trump or DeSantis?
[00:59:24.925 --> 00:59:31.809]  And everyone was like going flip-flopping on Trump and, you know, went through that time and it's like, I believe Trump's come around full circle.
[00:59:31.849 --> 00:59:32.649]  He's like the guy.
[00:59:32.729 --> 00:59:34.530]  And I thought this then, I think this now.
[00:59:35.026 --> 00:59:38.171]  I'd like to see Trump on the ticket with Flynn as VP.
[00:59:38.331 --> 00:59:40.514]  If that's a decent, you know, position for him.
[00:59:40.534 --> 00:59:43.338]  I don't know the politics involved with that, but I think them too.
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:50.966]  Absolutely, and a lot of decision makers, a lot of smart people are tuning in, and so that's why it's important for them to hear your voice.
[00:59:50.986 --> 00:59:51.567]  Great question.
[00:59:51.587 --> 00:59:55.190]  In fact, I was going to say something, and you said you liked my opinion, so thanks for the call, Travis.
[00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:58.010]  I'm hearing amazing stuff and I'd turn it over to you guys.
[00:59:58.010 --> 01:00:02.970]   Absolutely, and a lot of decision makers, a lot of smart people are tuning in and so
[01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:05.769]  that's why it's important for them to hear your voice.
[01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:06.769]  Great question.
[01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:10.210]   In fact, I was going to say something and you said you like my opinion, so thanks for
[01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:11.209]  the call, Travis.
[01:00:11.209 --> 01:00:12.209]  Let me give you my opinion.
[01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:18.729]   Well, let me give you my opinion when we come back on General Flynn for VP.
[01:00:19.612 --> 01:00:19.892]  Okay?
[01:00:20.472 --> 01:00:26.673]  I'll give you the straight opinion and I'll give you some inside baseball straight ahead on General Flynn.
[01:00:26.693 --> 01:00:33.974]  Because I said I'd like RFK or somebody to be his VP or Rand Paul, but I'd really like Flynn to be, but I'll explain why I didn't mention Flynn.
[01:00:34.414 --> 01:00:34.934]  We'll be right back.
[01:00:34.954 --> 01:00:35.314]  Stay with us.
[01:00:36.114 --> 01:00:39.415]  All right, I'm going to hit a lot of important news for part of the next segment.
[01:00:39.455 --> 01:00:43.376]  Continue with your calls in the same way right through into the next hour.
[01:00:43.416 --> 01:00:52.213]   But as the last caller, Travis, said, It is fascinating to really have a big, deep discussion and hear all the different angles from the amazing callers.
[01:00:52.994 --> 01:00:57.436]  And I think you're getting from the callers the same feeling I have, the same view I have.
[01:00:58.436 --> 01:01:00.457]  I mean, Trump is way more hardcore now.
[01:01:00.997 --> 01:01:06.759]  I'm still very upset about the poison shots, but the systems after him, he's hitting on all cylinders.
[01:01:09.258 --> 01:01:10.599]  I think they're going to try to assassinate him.
[01:01:10.619 --> 01:01:11.640]  What do you think about that?
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.781]  That would be a big national news story.
[01:01:13.821 --> 01:01:14.722]  I'm saying a no-brainer.
[01:01:14.762 --> 01:01:16.283]  Democrats are everywhere saying they want to kill him.
[01:01:17.884 --> 01:01:19.706]  So how do we protect Trump as well?
[01:01:19.726 --> 01:01:22.728]  All right, we're going to go back to your phone calls right now.
[01:01:22.848 --> 01:01:23.208]  Ray?
[01:01:23.228 --> 01:01:27.672]  Oh, I'm going to go to Ray in Kentucky, but I forgot I was going to mention what Travis said.
[01:01:29.201 --> 01:01:35.507]  I've met with Flynn some in Florida, in Texas, and I'll leave it at that.
[01:01:35.607 --> 01:01:40.832]  And I was really upset with Trump two years ago and told Flynn I thought he should run.
[01:01:40.872 --> 01:01:49.881]  But Flynn is a very humble person and wants to worry about the tactical things and the information war and waking up local governments and taking the grassroots back.
[01:01:50.742 --> 01:01:56.755]   And he really kind of just puts his energy behind Trump.
[01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:59.995]  And then that's another reason I'm supporting Trump.
[01:01:59.995 --> 01:02:04.875]   And so I want to be clear when I say I'd like to see a Rand Paul or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:02:04.875 --> 01:02:12.614]   as the VP, if Flynn would do it, then I would support Flynn even above Rand Paul.
[01:02:12.614 --> 01:02:14.975]  But it's a close, close second for Rand Paul.
[01:02:14.975 --> 01:02:17.835]  So I totally agree with the caller.
[01:02:17.835 --> 01:02:18.835]  Okay.
[01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:20.155]  Ray in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[01:02:20.155 --> 01:02:21.155]  Go ahead.
[01:02:21.155 --> 01:02:22.155]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:23.155]  Good, brother.
[01:02:23.155 --> 01:02:24.155]  All right.
[01:02:24.155 --> 01:02:29.634]   Well, this whole thing with Trump, I mean, it's gotten it's gotten kind of crazy, you
[01:02:29.634 --> 01:02:35.475]   know, as far as the left pushing all of this divisive stuff, dividing and dividing, go
[01:02:35.475 --> 01:02:36.594]  to war, go to war.
[01:02:37.262 --> 01:02:38.604]  All of us are pretty tired of that.
[01:02:39.425 --> 01:02:48.435]  And I think my main reason for calling is just to say it's hard for a lot of us to put trust and faith in people that haven't shown us what we need to see.
[01:02:48.455 --> 01:02:53.680]  The border stuff, lockdown, safety measures put into place, you know, the whole nine yards.
[01:02:54.762 --> 01:02:58.426]  And it's going to be, 2024 is going to be very interesting.
[01:02:59.207 --> 01:03:00.708]  So, we'll just leave it at that.
[01:03:00.748 --> 01:03:08.154]  I just want to say a statement that everybody, keep your focus on Jesus Christ so you can be forgiven for your sins.
[01:03:08.675 --> 01:03:09.936]  That's the way through all of this.
[01:03:10.416 --> 01:03:12.058]  Those that don't, we know where they go.
[01:03:12.078 --> 01:03:13.279]  I totally agree.
[01:03:13.299 --> 01:03:16.021]  Do not put your faith in man, put your faith in God.
[01:03:16.601 --> 01:03:17.082]  That's it.
[01:03:19.484 --> 01:03:20.044]  Alright, brother.
[01:03:20.164 --> 01:03:21.285]  Well, you take it easy, okay?
[01:03:21.305 --> 01:03:21.906]  Thank you, Ray.
[01:03:21.946 --> 01:03:22.887]  Thanks for calling to say that.
[01:03:22.907 --> 01:03:24.368]  It's the most important thing said here today.
[01:03:24.808 --> 01:03:26.349]  Steve in New York, you're on the air.
[01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:26.870]  Thanks for calling.
[01:03:28.528 --> 01:03:29.129]  Thanks Alex.
[01:03:29.389 --> 01:03:37.995]  I know that Donald Trump has pretty much gotten a little bit more base and he's starting to realize the New World Order and the deep state government and he's starting to call it out.
[01:03:38.015 --> 01:03:50.483]  But at the end of the day, if we're not talking about the election fraud like they did in 2020 where they clearly stole it, we're not going to see Trump, we're not going to see RFK, we're not going to see DeSantis, we're just going to see another four years of Joe Biden.
[01:03:50.888 --> 01:03:57.331]  So the focus really needs to be on election fraud because no matter what we talk about today, that's where the focus needs to be.
[01:03:57.631 --> 01:04:00.112]  They're just going to delay the counts another week or two.
[01:04:00.392 --> 01:04:02.133]  You'll go to bed thinking Trump's going to win.
[01:04:02.433 --> 01:04:05.494]  And then all of a sudden you wake up and then all of a sudden Biden's ahead.
[01:04:05.774 --> 01:04:07.075]  We're going to go through the same thing.
[01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:09.077]  So that's where the focus needs to be.
[01:04:09.217 --> 01:04:11.479]  Trump and the Republican Party should be focusing on the election.
[01:04:11.499 --> 01:04:14.602]  That's exactly what Flynn said to me two years ago at lunch in Florida.
[01:04:14.622 --> 01:04:15.623]  We met for two hours.
[01:04:16.264 --> 01:04:18.166]  He said if we don't stop that, we can't win.
[01:04:18.206 --> 01:04:20.788]  But the good news is a bunch of states are passing laws to block that.
[01:04:21.309 --> 01:04:23.831]  There's major evidence coming out, but I hear we've got a lot more to do.
[01:04:23.871 --> 01:04:24.472]  What should we do?
[01:04:25.172 --> 01:04:25.693]  How do we do that?
[01:04:26.909 --> 01:04:29.530]  We have to continue to speak up that there is fraud.
[01:04:29.851 --> 01:04:35.413]  We have to make sure we are volunteering at local polls to make sure that we see things that are going legal.
[01:04:35.433 --> 01:04:40.096]  If you see anything online, if you see people burning up votes, we have to report this.
[01:04:40.216 --> 01:04:46.339]  And at one o'clock in the morning, three o'clock in the morning, you've got to flood the voting booth at that time and expose these people.
[01:04:46.379 --> 01:04:48.780]  It's the only way for us to get who we want.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:49.060]  That's right.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.722]  We can't have them in Michigan and in Georgia.
[01:04:52.602 --> 01:04:53.283]  Oh yeah, I'm really crying.
[01:04:53.123 --> 01:04:56.403]   Arizona blocking the windows so no one can see what's happening.
[01:04:56.403 --> 01:04:57.802]  Give me a break.
[01:04:57.802 --> 01:05:00.802]   And their own internal footage shows them taking the same stacks of ballots,
[01:05:00.802 --> 01:05:02.802]  running them over and over again.
[01:05:02.802 --> 01:05:04.202]  Incredible.
[01:05:04.202 --> 01:05:05.842]  Thank you, Steve.
[01:05:05.842 --> 01:05:07.961]  Dawn in Chicago.
[01:05:07.961 --> 01:05:08.961]  I know you're crying.
[01:05:08.961 --> 01:05:10.362]  Lightfoot's not your mayor anymore.
[01:05:10.362 --> 01:05:12.443]  Dawn.
[01:05:12.443 --> 01:05:13.123]  Oh, yeah.
[01:05:13.123 --> 01:05:13.842]  I'm really crying.
[01:05:13.842 --> 01:05:18.961]  Yeah, I'm happy she's going.
[01:05:18.961 --> 01:05:22.842]  But the next two people that are running, I don't know.
[01:05:22.842 --> 01:05:24.362]  It could be worse.
[01:05:24.362 --> 01:05:28.242]   But I was just calling to say I really hope Trump does win again.
[01:05:28.242 --> 01:05:35.242]   But like your other caller, if they don't fix the voting, we're going to get four more years of Biden.
[01:05:35.242 --> 01:05:38.762]  But Trump needs to win to heal this country.
[01:05:38.762 --> 01:05:48.762]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:05:40.751 --> 01:05:53.358]  Well, another thing is that we know they stole the election, the evidence is overwhelming, but I'm not bashing the Cube people, but there was such confidence he would win, such confidence that everything was handled, that a lot of people didn't vote because they thought Trump was invincible.
[01:05:53.398 --> 01:05:54.778]  There was a lot of delusion going on.
[01:05:56.699 --> 01:05:58.460]  Yes, that blows my mind.
[01:05:58.841 --> 01:06:07.425]  Even in Chicago, the turnout compared to how many people live here is so low, and then people expect change.
[01:06:07.725 --> 01:06:08.986]  Everyone needs to get out and vote.
[01:06:10.572 --> 01:06:11.834]  I 100% agree with you, Don.
[01:06:11.854 --> 01:06:12.515]  Thanks for the call.
[01:06:12.595 --> 01:06:13.656]  Leonard in Florida.
[01:06:13.696 --> 01:06:14.297]  Leonard, go ahead.
[01:06:15.979 --> 01:06:17.841]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:06:17.861 --> 01:06:20.084]  I wanted to thank you for all the years of devotion.
[01:06:20.104 --> 01:06:23.048]  You're a true patriot, my friend, and thank you to everybody at InfoWars.
[01:06:23.863 --> 01:06:25.425]  I just want to plug one of your products.
[01:06:25.625 --> 01:06:27.367]  I use your shampoo and body wash.
[01:06:27.507 --> 01:06:28.689]  You guys going to be getting that back?
[01:06:28.709 --> 01:06:31.251]  Because I didn't see it on the website.
[01:06:31.292 --> 01:06:32.713]  Most of our products we never reorder.
[01:06:32.733 --> 01:06:35.016]  Even though they sold well, we didn't have the money to reorder them.
[01:06:35.656 --> 01:06:40.021]  But yes, the body wash, the shampoo, we're trying to get all the products back in.
[01:06:40.041 --> 01:06:42.384]  The problem is we're getting a lot back, but we get like 1,000 to 5,000 bottles.
[01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:47.368]  And then that sells out and then it's, so we're in a real catch-22.
[01:06:47.388 --> 01:06:52.772]  That's why the products we've got that are great, get those, and that's allowing us to slowly rebuild.
[01:06:52.812 --> 01:06:55.153]  Like we've got the Alex Jones for President t-shirt.
[01:06:55.193 --> 01:06:56.874]  But I told them, I said, order 15,000.
[01:06:57.075 --> 01:06:58.496]  They said, we don't have the money.
[01:06:59.156 --> 01:06:59.516]  They ordered 5,000.
[01:07:00.097 --> 01:07:04.079]  And now, as of today, there's like a thousand left.
[01:07:04.099 --> 01:07:05.060]  They'll be sold out today.
[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:06.001]  There'll be a waiting list.
[01:07:06.841 --> 01:07:12.224]  You order, more coming in two weeks, so we won't charge you till it ships.
[01:07:12.284 --> 01:07:15.385]  But that's funds we need, plus it's a great way to spread the word.
[01:07:15.746 --> 01:07:18.327]  So believe me, sir, we want to bring back the shampoo and body wash.
[01:07:19.388 --> 01:07:22.029]  Also, the natural hand sanitizers.
[01:07:23.069 --> 01:07:24.910]  We use essential oils that aren't toxic.
[01:07:25.191 --> 01:07:26.191]  Those were great sellers.
[01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:27.252]  We didn't reorder those.
[01:07:27.692 --> 01:07:31.654]  So you are definitely telling me what I already know is true, but I'm glad you're mentioning it.
[01:07:32.717 --> 01:07:34.738]  Yep, essential oils, that's important to me.
[01:07:34.798 --> 01:07:38.340]  It's healthy stuff that I can give to my kids and not worry it's not poison.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.801]  So, I really enjoy your products.
[01:07:41.321 --> 01:07:41.861]  I use a lot of them.
[01:07:41.881 --> 01:07:43.042]  But anyways, on to Trump.
[01:07:43.442 --> 01:07:48.724]  I want to vote for Trump because I think he's the only one with the thick skin enough to put up with all the barbs and everything that's going to come against him.
[01:07:48.744 --> 01:07:52.826]  It looks like he's starting to wake up to how deep the swamp is.
[01:07:53.724 --> 01:07:54.645]  I agree with the last caller.
[01:07:54.665 --> 01:07:58.009]  If we don't do something about the election, steal the election, they're just going to steal again.
[01:07:58.029 --> 01:07:59.470]  Look what they did to Carey Lake.
[01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:01.593]  I mean, right on the open, they stole a primary.
[01:08:01.653 --> 01:08:04.175]  Everybody knows it, and they're getting away with it.
[01:08:04.215 --> 01:08:08.240]  I mean, they're going to do the same thing here if we don't stop that kind of thing from going on.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.481]  So that really needs to stop.
[01:08:09.501 --> 01:08:13.485]  Yeah, they even created ballots that were an inch too short and didn't fit for Republican precincts.
[01:08:14.426 --> 01:08:15.107]  It was obvious.
[01:08:15.167 --> 01:08:15.887]  It was so obvious.
[01:08:15.968 --> 01:08:16.548]  And they stole it.
[01:08:16.588 --> 01:08:17.229]  Everybody knows it, right?
[01:08:18.022 --> 01:08:21.623]  The other thing is the evil cartel, the Federal Reserve.
[01:08:22.044 --> 01:08:22.844]  That's got to go.
[01:08:22.964 --> 01:08:25.045]  Somebody, but you don't really hear people talking about that.
[01:08:25.065 --> 01:08:25.225]  I agree.
[01:08:25.245 --> 01:08:27.085]  Trump needs to take control of the Federal Reserve.
[01:08:27.105 --> 01:08:27.826]  Another great point.
[01:08:27.886 --> 01:08:29.106]  Thank you so much.
[01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:32.187]  We're back in a few minutes with some breaking news and then your phone calls.
[01:08:32.227 --> 01:08:32.747]  Stay with us.
[01:08:33.188 --> 01:08:33.808]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:08:33.848 --> 01:08:35.568]  In fact, guys, I sent you some articles that you printed.
[01:08:35.969 --> 01:08:36.589]  Bring those in to me.
[01:08:36.629 --> 01:08:38.389]  Biden's made a major announcement.
[01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:44.852]  So let me get some news items that are very important and then go right back to your phone calls here on this Live Monday edition.
[01:08:45.925 --> 01:08:48.506]  But there's a lot of people saying, oh, DeSantis is skull and bones.
[01:08:48.566 --> 01:08:49.026]  No, he's not.
[01:08:49.086 --> 01:08:50.546]  He didn't go to that fraternity.
[01:08:51.207 --> 01:08:59.609]  But he did go to Yale, and he does think that George Herbert Walker Bush, the father of the modern, globalist, New World Order, chi-com takeover, is his idol.
[01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:11.532]  And then there's another Fox News clip where they're talking to a Republican analyst on Fox Business that will play with her, saying, yeah, he's basically run by Karl Rove and Jeb Bush.
[01:09:11.552 --> 01:09:12.412]  Well, I went and looked it up.
[01:09:13.053 --> 01:09:13.993]  He is working with them.
[01:09:14.875 --> 01:09:16.196]  They are fundraising for him.
[01:09:17.937 --> 01:09:19.398]  And it's very, very problematic.
[01:09:19.418 --> 01:09:26.542]  And that's just a kind of a cherry on top with why I'm going with Trump, especially when he came out against World War III.
[01:09:27.083 --> 01:09:28.624]  Now he's coming out against the transgenderism.
[01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:30.164]  So I like DeSantis.
[01:09:30.265 --> 01:09:30.925]  I like Trump.
[01:09:31.485 --> 01:09:32.426]  They're not our saviors.
[01:09:32.966 --> 01:09:36.889]  We've got to ask who can beat the deep state, who's promising to bring down the deep state.
[01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:38.690]  Here's a couple of those DeSantis clips.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:41.000]  Not great as far as campaign skills.
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:42.781]  He may get there, but he doesn't have them yet.
[01:09:42.801 --> 01:09:45.661]  Who's running his campaign?
[01:09:46.321 --> 01:09:47.982]  The Bushes are all tangled up with him.
[01:09:48.002 --> 01:09:48.682]  Bushes?
[01:09:48.722 --> 01:09:51.442]  Bush that can raise him a billion dollars and get him all kinds of money.
[01:09:51.462 --> 01:09:52.002]  Jeb Bush?
[01:09:52.282 --> 01:09:52.542]  Jeb Bush.
[01:09:52.602 --> 01:09:53.323]  George Bush.
[01:09:53.563 --> 01:09:55.223]  Yeah, they're great.
[01:09:55.243 --> 01:09:56.063]  Karl Rove involved?
[01:09:56.083 --> 01:09:57.183]  Karl Rove is involved.
[01:09:57.423 --> 01:09:59.244]  I assume he'll be the coach on the field.
[01:09:59.304 --> 01:09:59.984]  I think he is.
[01:10:00.204 --> 01:10:02.444]  But do you know that he's been advising dissent?
[01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:03.724]  He's been advising dissent.
[01:10:03.745 --> 01:10:05.905]  Who's the most inspirational person you've met and why?
[01:10:07.597 --> 01:10:09.238]  Inspirational person that I've met?
[01:10:09.258 --> 01:10:10.419]  Hmm, I don't know.
[01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:11.140]  That's a tough one.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.743]  I'm trying to think who in kind of modern times.
[01:10:14.803 --> 01:10:19.486]  I mean, part of the thing when, you know, when you're growing up, when you're a blue-collar kid, I don't really get to meet a lot of people.
[01:10:19.907 --> 01:10:23.229]  And then even in Congress now, I've only been there for four months.
[01:10:23.249 --> 01:10:26.692]  I mean, I guess I probably would say Bush 41.
[01:10:29.286 --> 01:10:37.090]  And in the full clip, he goes on to say he was the captain of the baseball team and so was I. I mean, it's just, it's not a good look.
[01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:37.951]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:10:38.731 --> 01:10:41.573]  Okay, here's where I stand on TikTok.
[01:10:43.073 --> 01:10:47.956]  You've got all these Republican lawmakers and some Democrats coming out and saying, ban TikTok.
[01:10:48.776 --> 01:10:52.879]  And of course, you got AOC, who loves the Chai Com, so she's defending it, saying it's wonderful.
[01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:56.821]  So she doesn't defend free speech in a lot of places, but she defends it with the Chai Coms.
[01:10:57.813 --> 01:10:59.814]  But yes, TikTok spies on users.
[01:11:00.254 --> 01:11:02.115]  Yes, TikTok's run by the Chinese government.
[01:11:02.535 --> 01:11:07.017]  Yes, it's designed here to make us mindless and stupid and distract ourselves.
[01:11:07.037 --> 01:11:09.578]  Yes, there it's all about education and being strong.
[01:11:10.459 --> 01:11:12.980]  But people should not go on there themselves.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:16.101]  People should keep their children off of it themselves.
[01:11:17.662 --> 01:11:20.683]  People should keep it off their phones and out of their houses.
[01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:22.444]  That's up to us to do.
[01:11:24.358 --> 01:11:27.401]  Is TikTok pushing child porn like Twitter was before Musk bought it?
[01:11:27.581 --> 01:11:27.841]  No.
[01:11:28.942 --> 01:11:30.243]  Got a lot of degenerate stuff, though.
[01:11:31.104 --> 01:11:34.226]  Is TikTok censoring Americans?
[01:11:34.406 --> 01:11:34.907]  Yes.
[01:11:35.287 --> 01:11:35.887]  Is that wrong?
[01:11:35.927 --> 01:11:36.328]  Yes.
[01:11:37.569 --> 01:11:39.671]  They were all anti-Trump on there during the campaign.
[01:11:39.711 --> 01:11:41.312]  TikTok tries to ban me all the time.
[01:11:42.473 --> 01:11:44.855]  But am I like the system that wants to ban me?
[01:11:44.935 --> 01:11:45.115]  No.
[01:11:45.315 --> 01:11:48.057]  I say, as long as it's not illegal, leave it up there.
[01:11:48.958 --> 01:11:50.820]  Now, should the Chinese government be owning it and running it?
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:51.020]  No.
[01:11:53.444 --> 01:11:54.265]  But should the U.S.
[01:11:54.305 --> 01:11:56.346]  government, or the leftist arm of the U.S.
[01:11:56.366 --> 01:11:58.168]  government, be heavily involved in all the other big tech?
[01:11:58.548 --> 01:11:59.288]  And the answer is no.
[01:11:59.348 --> 01:12:02.391]  So the whole thing is very hypocritical.
[01:12:02.471 --> 01:12:04.272]  AOC joins in defense.
[01:12:04.312 --> 01:12:11.097]  TikTok does not disclose that the platform's Chinese parent company donated $150,000 to her congressional caucus.
[01:12:12.558 --> 01:12:17.822]  So yeah, the infiltration is very, very serious.
[01:12:19.944 --> 01:12:21.385]  And that's where I stand on TikTok.
[01:12:21.405 --> 01:12:22.646]  People are asking me about it.
[01:12:23.613 --> 01:12:24.954]  And it's like 5G.
[01:12:25.094 --> 01:12:33.939]  I don't want Huawei, Chinese government controlled, to put 5G in everywhere, especially by military bases, where they can scan and break into all the electronics.
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:36.641]  But why is everybody else putting in 5G?
[01:12:37.682 --> 01:12:39.643]  Just the cancer causes alone are over the top.
[01:12:40.697 --> 01:12:41.758]  All right, now let's look at this.
[01:12:42.618 --> 01:12:43.619]  This is Fox News.
[01:12:44.099 --> 01:12:49.102]  Biden vows to tank GOP effort to boost energy production.
[01:12:49.762 --> 01:12:51.063]  He vows to kill pipelines.
[01:12:51.103 --> 01:12:54.425]  He vows to kill drilling permits, as he's done the last two-plus years.
[01:12:57.326 --> 01:12:59.707]  So, he's an enemy of the republic.
[01:13:00.428 --> 01:13:02.169]  Impeach him over this alone.
[01:13:03.872 --> 01:13:22.344]  Over a year and a half ago, the Supreme Court ruled that the FDA and the EPA and the Department of Energy cannot just make law by regulations and shut down more coal plants and more drilling and more gas pipelines and more gas drilling.
[01:13:26.487 --> 01:13:27.067]  Think about that.
[01:13:27.788 --> 01:13:28.988]  Because it's not in law.
[01:13:29.389 --> 01:13:30.970]  All these regulations are not law.
[01:13:32.042 --> 01:13:40.610]  But Biden instructed the Department of Energy and the rest of them to just completely ignore all that and do whatever they want.
[01:13:43.673 --> 01:13:44.794]  So, where's the impeachment?
[01:13:48.057 --> 01:13:53.703]  Biden has had federal courts rule that he has to control the border and enforce the different titles.
[01:13:54.504 --> 01:13:55.605]  He doesn't do that either.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:04.384]  So you can't look anywhere and see a better example of Biden out to hurt the average working person than cutting energy off.
[01:14:05.685 --> 01:14:06.605]  Very simple.
[01:14:07.386 --> 01:14:09.247]  So he promised to blow up Nord Stream, he did.
[01:14:09.307 --> 01:14:15.530]  He promised to shut down the Keystone Pipeline, first thing he did day one, January 20th, 2021 was that.
[01:14:18.646 --> 01:14:19.907]  And that ties into this report.
[01:14:20.007 --> 01:14:20.447]  Shocker!
[01:14:20.527 --> 01:14:23.790]  Ford Motors losing billions in electric car vehicles.
[01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:24.971]  People don't want them.
[01:14:25.611 --> 01:14:26.532]  They don't work.
[01:14:26.992 --> 01:14:29.134]  They don't have good reliability.
[01:14:29.294 --> 01:14:30.335]  They suck.
[01:14:31.436 --> 01:14:32.737]  And I'm not an engineer.
[01:14:33.718 --> 01:14:37.300]  And I'm certainly not Japanese, but I don't think anybody debates the Japanese.
[01:14:38.401 --> 01:14:42.444]  On average, like saying Kenyans are the best long-distance runners.
[01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:46.448]  Like almost all the world champion runners are Kenyan.
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:53.483]  Not saying there isn't some great other runners, but the Japanese are amongst the best engineers on earth.
[01:14:53.963 --> 01:15:00.486]  The head of Toyota came out five years ago, two years ago, and this year, and said, we've studied the live and snot out of these electric cars.
[01:15:00.526 --> 01:15:01.327]  They don't work.
[01:15:01.827 --> 01:15:02.947]  They cause more carbon.
[01:15:02.987 --> 01:15:06.549]  They cause more power to be lost transferring it down the power lines.
[01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:08.770]  They said they're crap.
[01:15:11.031 --> 01:15:12.632]  And they've got the best electric cars there are.
[01:15:14.841 --> 01:15:42.387]  They said maybe a hybrid gas engine with an electric engine so that you take the power from the combustion engine and you take some of that power and you charge batteries in the car so you're able to then drive on a full tank of gas on a Japanese car 400 miles and then get another 300 out of the battery.
[01:15:42.928 --> 01:15:43.988]  I would not be against.
[01:15:45.146 --> 01:15:50.128]  A car, and they've got them, where when you run out of gas or got an issue, hey, guess what?
[01:15:52.789 --> 01:15:53.570]  I got batteries.
[01:15:57.931 --> 01:16:05.054]  And the Japanese have recommended dual system, not just a hybrid where the electricity and the gas go together into the power, but where you have batteries that are a backup.
[01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:06.035]  That makes a lot of sense.
[01:16:07.776 --> 01:16:11.157]  And if you want to go into turbo mode, you flip on both, you've got electric and gas power.
[01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:15.836]  Pulling a big load or whatever.
[01:16:16.096 --> 01:16:33.321]  The Japanese have got it figured out, and they have said, at Toyota, at Honda, at Mitsubishi, their major, Yamasaki, all of them, they've come out and said, electric motorcycles suck!
[01:16:34.542 --> 01:16:36.462]  Electric jet skis suck!
[01:16:37.823 --> 01:16:39.583]  Electric trucks suck!
[01:16:40.403 --> 01:16:41.884]  They don't work well.
[01:16:43.322 --> 01:16:46.183]  And they cause more carbon to make the damn cars.
[01:16:48.044 --> 01:16:50.324]  They cost twice as much as gas vehicles.
[01:16:50.464 --> 01:16:53.045]  They do not work.
[01:16:54.126 --> 01:16:55.526]  They are a bridge of failure.
[01:16:57.067 --> 01:16:58.407]  They're not a replacement system.
[01:16:59.968 --> 01:17:02.949]  Now, could hydrogen replace gasoline?
[01:17:04.749 --> 01:17:05.049]  Yes.
[01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:09.291]  But it would take a decade to move the infrastructure over to it.
[01:17:09.331 --> 01:17:11.972]  And the Japanese have said hydrogen is the way to go.
[01:17:14.164 --> 01:17:18.069]  And that's if you just believe this goal that carbon is evil.
[01:17:18.089 --> 01:17:31.625]  If everything's, well the UN says and the globalists say carbon's bad, so we've got all these e-fuels and all this hydrogen and all this other stuff, when meanwhile the earth is way lower carbon level in the atmosphere than it was a million years ago.
[01:17:31.665 --> 01:17:32.146]  They know that.
[01:17:33.308 --> 01:17:34.549]  Mars lost its atmosphere.
[01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:41.072]  And if you look at trends, the Earth, they're estimating in another million years, might be uninhabitable because of loss of atmosphere.
[01:17:41.512 --> 01:17:44.513]  We need cows with methane coming out their ass.
[01:17:45.013 --> 01:17:47.935]  We, all of us, everything we do makes the atmosphere.
[01:17:48.195 --> 01:17:49.675]  We got an atmosphere for a reason.
[01:17:50.016 --> 01:17:51.576]  We need more carbon dioxide.
[01:17:51.596 --> 01:17:52.697]  We need more methane.
[01:17:54.217 --> 01:17:55.018]  Those are facts.
[01:17:56.715 --> 01:18:01.756]  But John Kerry says Biden's getting ready to take more actions with executive orders to ban more cars.
[01:18:02.256 --> 01:18:03.716]  Your phone calls are straight ahead.
[01:18:03.756 --> 01:18:04.697]  Stay with us.
[01:18:05.097 --> 01:18:07.897]  Infowars.com is the coordinates of Liberty.
[01:18:08.137 --> 01:18:08.778]  Infowars.
[01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:19.120]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide on this March 27th, 2023 transmission in defiance of tyranny.
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:25.001]  Father, I'm going to take your daughter out tonight.
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:27.962]  I'm gonna show her my world.
[01:18:29.783 --> 01:18:31.104]  What an aggressive statement.
[01:18:32.065 --> 01:18:33.807]  I'm gonna take your daughter out tonight.
[01:18:34.148 --> 01:18:36.148]  I'm gonna show her my world.
[01:18:36.148 --> 01:18:43.347]  But what is the whole transgender cult doing?
[01:18:43.347 --> 01:18:53.346]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:18:44.747 --> 01:18:50.791]  It's not some 17-year-old young man trying to take your 16-year-old daughter out and show her his world.
[01:18:51.732 --> 01:18:55.914]  It's a bunch of weird, sick, evil, child-obsessed pedophiles.
[01:18:56.214 --> 01:18:58.236]  And I'm going to be covering that coming up next hour.
[01:19:00.597 --> 01:19:02.658]  The truth is the system's trying to suppress liberty.
[01:19:03.159 --> 01:19:03.959]  We are the rebels.
[01:19:03.999 --> 01:19:04.660]  They'll never win.
[01:19:07.108 --> 01:19:09.650]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's go right back to your phone calls.
[01:19:09.730 --> 01:19:12.052]  We took a ton already, but I'm going to take a lot more now.
[01:19:12.553 --> 01:19:15.575]  Bill in Canada on Trump in 2024 here on the air.
[01:19:19.899 --> 01:19:20.199]  Hello?
[01:19:20.539 --> 01:19:21.160]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[01:19:22.501 --> 01:19:30.287]  Oh, anyways, I'm a big supporter and a longtime listener since like 2002.
[01:19:31.428 --> 01:19:33.830]  Anyways, I think... Well, God bless you, Bill.
[01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:34.931]  You sound like an interesting guy.
[01:19:34.951 --> 01:19:35.772]  Where do you live in Canada?
[01:19:37.173 --> 01:19:38.074]  Edmonton, Alberta.
[01:19:38.814 --> 01:19:40.676]  What do you make of the craziness of the world, my friend?
[01:19:42.697 --> 01:19:58.269]  Oh, it's hectic, and it's insane, and it just seems like every time you turn around, they're quarterbacking, you know, something worldwide against the Liberty Movement.
[01:19:59.030 --> 01:20:07.717]   Like, you look at the election fraud in the States, Brazil, Canada, And who knows how many other countries.
[01:20:07.717 --> 01:20:16.077]  Are we not vindicated how it's all come true?
[01:20:16.077 --> 01:20:26.077]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:20:18.542 --> 01:20:19.283]  Yes, we are.
[01:20:20.463 --> 01:20:23.324]  And we just need to move forward in a positive direction.
[01:20:24.285 --> 01:20:34.689]  And I think a good way to do that like in Canada would be for food independence and move towards energy independence because we still import a lot of oil.
[01:20:36.488 --> 01:20:37.789]  Canada is like Texas.
[01:20:37.869 --> 01:20:39.190]  It could be 100% independent.
[01:20:40.770 --> 01:20:40.990]  Yeah.
[01:20:43.492 --> 01:20:44.913]  And we need to start acting like a dulling.
[01:20:45.153 --> 01:20:50.235]  Not to leave Canada or not to leave America, but to have the people exercise their power.
[01:20:51.556 --> 01:20:54.398]  Yeah, and we need the country to be taken back.
[01:20:55.358 --> 01:20:55.698]  I agree.
[01:20:55.738 --> 01:20:56.759]  What's your view on Trump 2024?
[01:20:56.879 --> 01:21:05.824]  I hope Trump wins because he's the best at hopefully taking out the deep state.
[01:21:08.675 --> 01:21:09.415]  I agree with you, brother.
[01:21:09.435 --> 01:21:10.956]  How long have you been listening, Bill?
[01:21:13.416 --> 01:21:17.137]  Since 2002, 2003, somewhere in there.
[01:21:17.417 --> 01:21:18.937]  Well, I appreciate you getting on air with us.
[01:21:18.997 --> 01:21:19.478]  Anything else?
[01:21:21.178 --> 01:21:21.418]  No.
[01:21:21.718 --> 01:21:25.439]  Best of luck, and praying for you all the time.
[01:21:25.779 --> 01:21:26.339]  I can feel it.
[01:21:26.419 --> 01:21:26.779]  I need it.
[01:21:27.439 --> 01:21:27.840]  Thank you.
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:29.080]  I want to say something about the listeners.
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:33.701]  I ask for your word of mouth, I ask for your prayer, and I ask for your financial support humbly.
[01:21:34.588 --> 01:21:36.770]  But let me tell you, prayer is number one, baby.
[01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:37.931]  And I can feel it.
[01:21:37.971 --> 01:21:39.352]  We would not be here without your prayer.
[01:21:39.372 --> 01:21:40.854]  I can feel your love.
[01:21:41.074 --> 01:21:43.156]  The love is back at you, and I appreciate you.
[01:21:45.458 --> 01:21:48.040]  Staken in Indiana.
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:48.881]  Did I get that right?
[01:21:50.423 --> 01:21:50.903]  Right, Alex.
[01:21:50.963 --> 01:21:53.706]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:21:55.147 --> 01:21:58.230]  First off, I just want to say how sobering it is when you talk about your rebuild.
[01:21:58.851 --> 01:22:01.452]  I've been a fan and a listener for a long time of what you do.
[01:22:01.752 --> 01:22:19.039]  And to go now to the store and just see one page of eight t-shirts when it used to be 20 pages, hundreds of awesome shirts, which I'm proud to say I own over a dozen different ones from the George Washington 1776 Lincoln ones to just a lot of them that are gone.
[01:22:19.079 --> 01:22:22.560]  But anyway, thanks for standing up every day and moving forward.
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:22.900]  No, no.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:23.880]  I want to tell the listeners.
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:24.861]  I'm not going to cut you short.
[01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:28.076]  We came within inches of shutting down.
[01:22:28.096 --> 01:22:36.282]  I have put everything I've got, all my money, everything in, and by the grace of God, we're clawing back out of it with your support.
[01:22:36.302 --> 01:22:37.043]  But yes, we are.
[01:22:37.403 --> 01:22:41.306]  We have been so close to being shut down, and it's only you guys keep us on air.
[01:22:41.326 --> 01:22:41.646]  Go ahead.
[01:22:42.547 --> 01:22:46.450]  No, it's just really sobering, man, because I see that, and I shop.
[01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:47.851]  You got the storable foods.
[01:22:48.231 --> 01:22:48.891]  Those are awesome.
[01:22:48.911 --> 01:22:51.513]  I don't have a generator, so I got a basement full of those.
[01:22:51.593 --> 01:22:53.615]  I just need bottled water to make them, and I've tried them.
[01:22:54.022 --> 01:22:57.784]  They say it's fine for when that day comes, but it's just sobering to see.
[01:22:57.944 --> 01:23:02.047]  And I just wanted to thank you for, you know, standing up and fighting through all the crap you got to deal with.
[01:23:02.387 --> 01:23:04.708]  Okay, man, so I'm going to vote for RFK Jr.
[01:23:05.128 --> 01:23:07.630]  unless Trump does what you say and puts Rand Paul as beef.
[01:23:07.670 --> 01:23:08.190]  And here's why.
[01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:14.454]  I mean, you said it in 20, and you said COVID's a test drive, virus is treatable, but this is just the test.
[01:23:14.514 --> 01:23:17.435]  This is what they're putting out there to see who's going to do what.
[01:23:17.575 --> 01:23:18.336]  Let's look at the board.
[01:23:18.775 --> 01:23:23.576]  And then now look at now, you're always right, you get Doc Redfield comes on and does just as you said.
[01:23:23.917 --> 01:23:32.299]  He sells Fauci out and then on Friday one of the greatest shows in InfoWars history with General Flynn talking about the next great pandemic and the virus that's going to be.
[01:23:32.619 --> 01:23:34.620]  Just put it out there because we're going to get hit with it again.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:38.041]  They're going to unleash it on us and how we're going to just manage and deal through it.
[01:23:38.341 --> 01:23:42.282]  This probably won't be as treatable, but there'll be just things that have to be done.
[01:23:42.382 --> 01:23:43.563]  And then you've got Trump out there.
[01:23:43.583 --> 01:23:44.903]  Yeah, okay, he's con.
[01:23:45.123 --> 01:23:45.703]  Fine, good.
[01:23:45.943 --> 01:23:49.284]   Well, he surrounds himself with a bunch of people that are All the time.
[01:23:49.304 --> 01:23:50.404]  Hey, be nice to Trump.
[01:23:50.424 --> 01:23:52.106]  You can be a wolf.
[01:23:52.526 --> 01:23:56.789]  And if you're nice to him and you show him how much you care about him, he brings you in.
[01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:58.611]  Look, he picked your own pile.
[01:23:58.711 --> 01:23:59.472]  You just talked about that.
[01:23:59.512 --> 01:24:00.713]  I'll say this about Trump.
[01:24:01.633 --> 01:24:03.435]  Man, if you kiss his ass, he loves it.
[01:24:03.615 --> 01:24:07.838]  And that's why, you know, he stopped calling me years ago because I wouldn't sit there.
[01:24:07.918 --> 01:24:10.320]  I'd say, sir, I don't want to hear how great I am.
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:11.441]  I can tell you how great you are.
[01:24:11.541 --> 01:24:12.162]  I want action.
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:18.284]  And he would listen to what I said, but the people listening on the phone would go ape over it.
[01:24:19.084 --> 01:24:21.626]  Because I don't care about being famous.
[01:24:21.686 --> 01:24:23.767]  I don't care about hanging out at Mar-a-Lago.
[01:24:23.868 --> 01:24:25.309]  I care about defeating the New World Order.
[01:24:26.489 --> 01:24:26.810]  Amen.
[01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:29.511]  And he keeps going on.
[01:24:29.532 --> 01:24:32.994]  Those shots didn't save over 100 million lives.
[01:24:33.394 --> 01:24:35.776]  They've caused more death, disablement, and damages.
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:39.040]  And then people say, oh, you can do what you want.
[01:24:39.181 --> 01:24:41.741]  Hey, tell that to the airline pilots in the FAA.
[01:24:41.801 --> 01:24:42.581]  No, I hear you.
[01:24:42.741 --> 01:24:43.181]  I hear you.
[01:24:43.241 --> 01:24:50.962]  My issue is then what do we do if the alternative, I'm not a lesser to evil guys, but if the alternative is a thousand percent worse, what do we do?
[01:24:52.343 --> 01:25:00.744]  RFK Jr., man, I think if Rand Paul's with him, I think that then when we get hit again and we still have somebody who can guide the country through the next pandemic.
[01:25:00.764 --> 01:25:03.325]  Well, there's no doubt they can't get our guns right now.
[01:25:03.365 --> 01:25:04.465]  So they're going to do another virus.
[01:25:04.485 --> 01:25:04.785]  You're right.
[01:25:04.805 --> 01:25:05.425]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:10.431]  I like RFK Jr., but he needs to come out against gun control and come out against abortion.
[01:25:11.091 --> 01:25:11.831]  I really trust him.
[01:25:11.871 --> 01:25:12.571]  He's a good man.
[01:25:12.611 --> 01:25:13.332]  He's a loving man.
[01:25:13.352 --> 01:25:14.352]  He's a well-spoken man.
[01:25:14.712 --> 01:25:15.432]  He's the real deal.
[01:25:15.492 --> 01:25:20.153]  My spirit tells me he's good, but he's got to get rid of all the Democrat baggage, and I would support him for president.
[01:25:21.513 --> 01:25:22.954]  Minute Man in Massachusetts.
[01:25:22.974 --> 01:25:23.434]  You're on the air.
[01:25:23.514 --> 01:25:24.054]  Thanks for holding.
[01:25:25.274 --> 01:25:25.674]  Hey, Alex.
[01:25:25.694 --> 01:25:26.695]  Haven't talked to you since 2013.
[01:25:26.735 --> 01:25:27.715]  Good to talk to you again.
[01:25:27.735 --> 01:25:28.475]  Good to talk to you, brother.
[01:25:29.682 --> 01:25:33.724]  I just wanted to point out something that's overlooked is some of Trump's horrible personnel decisions.
[01:25:33.924 --> 01:25:35.404]  He's the one that put Chris Wray in.
[01:25:35.445 --> 01:25:36.705]  He's the one that put Millie in.
[01:25:36.785 --> 01:25:38.146]  He's the one that put Bill Barr in.
[01:25:38.186 --> 01:25:39.786]  He's the one that put Jeff Sessions in.
[01:25:40.127 --> 01:25:43.728]  He put Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court when he should have put Lagoa out of Florida.
[01:25:44.188 --> 01:25:48.030]  And has he ever said it was a mistake to put Chris Wray at the FBI?
[01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:50.511]  He needs to come out and say these things.
[01:25:51.952 --> 01:25:52.292]  I hear you.
[01:25:52.312 --> 01:25:52.712]  Continue.
[01:25:54.313 --> 01:25:58.497]  And I want to believe in him, but words are one thing and actions are another.
[01:25:58.517 --> 01:26:03.161]  And a lot of people have had their lives destroyed because they believed in him, and he let a lot of us down.
[01:26:03.181 --> 01:26:12.488]  And if he wants my support again, I need to see him have some humility and admit he's made some big mistakes and say how he's going to be specific about how he's going to correct them in the future.
[01:26:12.508 --> 01:26:17.873]  And of course, lesser of two evils, I would support him over Biden or Dems any day of the week.
[01:26:18.233 --> 01:26:26.329]   But he really needs to have some humility and admit he's wrong on the vaccine, admit he was wrong hiring Wray, Admit he was wrong for not pardoning his sons and bringing Snowden back.
[01:26:26.369 --> 01:26:28.713]  Like, he sided with the Deep State on those things, you know?
[01:26:28.894 --> 01:26:30.857]  Words are one thing, but actions are another.
[01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:33.722]  Well said, sir.
[01:26:33.782 --> 01:26:34.263]  Anything else?
[01:26:35.558 --> 01:26:39.240]  The last thing I want to say is I honestly think there is zero chance they will let him back in.
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:44.142]  I think they will kill him or escalate World War 3 because I think they are afraid of him.
[01:26:44.663 --> 01:26:45.803]  So I don't know.
[01:26:46.263 --> 01:26:55.428]  But see, that's the point why I'm tentatively supporting him is because they hate him and they fear him and even though he's got problems, he's the real deal.
[01:26:55.488 --> 01:26:57.429]  I mean, he's got problems too.
[01:26:57.449 --> 01:27:00.991]  I mean, he's got warts and all, but he definitely wants to be president.
[01:27:01.051 --> 01:27:01.951]  He was president.
[01:27:02.332 --> 01:27:03.752]  He definitely doesn't think he's out to get us.
[01:27:03.792 --> 01:27:04.993]  He's just very, very pig-headed.
[01:27:05.413 --> 01:27:06.594]  So how do we thread that needle?
[01:27:08.595 --> 01:27:13.279]  This might be a little unorthodox, but he needs to take like a mushroom trip and kill his ego or something.
[01:27:14.119 --> 01:27:15.660]  Someone's got to get to him.
[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:16.261]  I agree.
[01:27:16.641 --> 01:27:19.023]  I think I should take mushrooms with President Trump.
[01:27:20.117 --> 01:27:20.717]  I would love that.
[01:27:21.258 --> 01:27:22.518]  I did take them with Mike Tyson.
[01:27:22.558 --> 01:27:26.740]  I'm not a big drug guy, but I've taken some hallucinogens here and there over the years.
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:27.680]  I don't take them very often.
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:29.641]  I've taken them with Joe Rogan.
[01:27:29.741 --> 01:27:30.962]  I've taken them with Mike Tyson.
[01:27:33.743 --> 01:27:35.524]  If you have control of your mind, it's not that big a deal.
[01:27:37.565 --> 01:27:38.025]  I'm honest.
[01:27:38.065 --> 01:27:39.046]  I'm not a hypocrite, folks.
[01:27:39.106 --> 01:27:39.986]  I'm not promoting drugs.
[01:27:40.686 --> 01:27:44.948]  In fact, young people, don't take anything illegal because it's all basically laced with fentanyl now.
[01:27:45.689 --> 01:27:47.309]  You can't experiment with it.
[01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:48.090]  We'll be right back.
[01:27:49.346 --> 01:27:51.047]  The mission is not impossible.
[01:27:52.027 --> 01:27:53.908]  Laying down to tyranny is a choice.
[01:27:54.528 --> 01:27:55.869]  We decide to fight back.
[01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:57.230]  Welcome back.
[01:27:59.271 --> 01:28:02.452]  All right, here's what I'm going to do.
[01:28:02.472 --> 01:28:09.515]  I'm going to, in this segment, the next two segments, the next half hour, take every single caller on the board.
[01:28:11.796 --> 01:28:26.132]   And then I'm going to hit All of this news that I have not covered yet, and there is a lot of it and a lot of breaking news as well, but some very good news, some very serious news, some horrifying news.
[01:28:27.173 --> 01:28:28.553]  We're going to hit it all coming up.
[01:28:30.273 --> 01:28:31.473]  But the battle is being joined.
[01:28:31.513 --> 01:28:32.874]  Humanity is rejecting tyranny.
[01:28:32.894 --> 01:28:34.834]  It's a very powerful time to be alive.
[01:28:36.415 --> 01:28:38.235]  And Tucker is way better than I am.
[01:28:39.912 --> 01:28:43.420]  And hyping something up for a week and then getting a huge audience to tune in.
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:44.903]  I just kind of go, here's the big news.
[01:28:46.426 --> 01:28:50.535]  But we almost do a disservice covering what I'm going to cover at the bottom of the hour.
[01:28:53.103 --> 01:28:54.164]  Without really building it up.
[01:28:54.184 --> 01:28:55.726]  I should do a whole special report on this.
[01:28:56.667 --> 01:29:03.755]  In fact, guys, I think I told you this, but we have this footage of the Metro Police helping break down the barricades and telling folks to go into the Capitol.
[01:29:04.376 --> 01:29:11.323]  But then there's dirty cops, dirty media revealed, undercover police help steal police riot shields and pass through broken glass doors.
[01:29:11.404 --> 01:29:12.204]  And then there's this.
[01:29:13.351 --> 01:29:14.652]  Twenty confirmed incidents.
[01:29:14.672 --> 01:29:16.452]  There's a bunch of videos and articles, get them for me.
[01:29:17.073 --> 01:29:22.255]  The dozens of Feds, FBI agents, and state operatives who infiltrated the Trump crowds on January 6th at the U.S.
[01:29:22.275 --> 01:29:24.035]  Capitol and led the protests.
[01:29:24.055 --> 01:29:31.278]  Now, I know the general audience already knows this, but we have total, on top of all the other proof, more proof.
[01:29:32.439 --> 01:29:40.502]  And this is a big deal because they're using January 6th to roll out the Homeland Security operation, the American people are the terror threat, and to set up this police state.
[01:29:42.452 --> 01:29:45.873]  Then we've got governments passing laws against feeding people toxic bugs.
[01:29:46.834 --> 01:29:49.014]  We've got new mRNA poison shots coming out.
[01:29:49.034 --> 01:29:54.676]  We've got the whole transgender cult attacking people everywhere and running into brick walls.
[01:29:54.716 --> 01:29:55.336]  We've got that.
[01:29:55.376 --> 01:29:58.017]  We've got so much to cover here today.
[01:29:58.037 --> 01:30:00.538]  But right now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:30:01.038 --> 01:30:02.939]  Pete in Washington, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:30:03.239 --> 01:30:05.160]  Your view on Trump as president, what do you think?
[01:30:06.414 --> 01:30:06.954]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:30:06.994 --> 01:30:09.956]  I think the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.
[01:30:10.336 --> 01:30:12.957]  We know Trump's driven by his ego, not by pragmatism.
[01:30:13.117 --> 01:30:15.058]  DeSantis is driven by pragmatism.
[01:30:15.418 --> 01:30:18.460]  Look at how many people are voting with their feet and going to Florida.
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:26.483]  And my nightmare situation is we got a Republican who's pro-vax, Trump, against a Democrat, RFK Jr., who's anti-vax.
[01:30:26.764 --> 01:30:28.304]  What kind of a freak show would that be?
[01:30:29.005 --> 01:30:36.068]  If Trump comes in late against the vax, they're going to drop the entire house of cards down on his head.
[01:30:36.775 --> 01:30:37.856]  Because he supported it.
[01:30:37.677 --> 01:30:41.237]   Oh, you can see, as I said over a year and a half ago, they're getting ready to frame
[01:30:41.237 --> 01:30:45.757]   Trump for it, and if Trump defends it, he's not framed for it, he put his name on it.
[01:30:45.757 --> 01:30:51.516]   Exactly, and nobody's going to - General Flynn posted a thing on Twitter today that was a
[01:30:51.516 --> 01:30:58.876]   speech from JFK, and JFK said, "An error doesn't become a mistake until you refuse to correct
[01:30:59.364 --> 01:31:01.325]  And that's exactly what Trump's doing.
[01:31:01.705 --> 01:31:09.851]  He's letting his ego stand in the face of an incredible amount of empirical evidence and individuals who've been harmed.
[01:31:10.658 --> 01:31:18.043]  And if he loves this country more than he loves what he sees in the mirror, he's going to renounce the vaccine now.
[01:31:18.463 --> 01:31:20.004]  We need to move forward.
[01:31:20.104 --> 01:31:30.231]  And the number one threat to the American public, to my family, to myself, and the number one issue, if I had to guess, that's been used on InfoWars in terms of time is the vaccine.
[01:31:30.511 --> 01:31:33.233]  To ignore that issue is to ignore the attack.
[01:31:33.253 --> 01:31:33.673]  No, I hear you.
[01:31:33.693 --> 01:31:34.734]  And you know what I think?
[01:31:34.834 --> 01:31:35.475]  You know what I think?
[01:31:35.795 --> 01:31:37.496]  I'm going to look at this next rallies.
[01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:40.078]  I'm going to try to go to the rallies and not make a scene.
[01:31:41.179 --> 01:31:45.663]  Use my free speech to say, hey, we need to be exposing the shots more.
[01:31:46.143 --> 01:31:58.314]  And I think all of you should go to the rallies too and talk to other people and make an issue about it because this is the big place he needs to expose the deep state and how they set us all up.
[01:31:58.734 --> 01:32:00.356]  I totally agree with you and I appreciate your call.
[01:32:01.305 --> 01:32:05.609]  All right, we're going to break, join some stations that don't carry these first five minutes every hour.
[01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:21.542]  And we're going to go to Candace, and we're going to go to Wild, and we're going to go to Sylvia, and Phillip, and Mike, and Wynn, and Josh, and so many others that are patiently sitting there on the line.
[01:32:22.883 --> 01:32:26.346]  And we are going to continue with your calls and news.
[01:32:27.253 --> 01:32:29.875]  We are now into the third hour today.
[01:32:29.935 --> 01:32:33.718]  Gerald Cilente, the great trends forecaster, takes over in the fourth hour at 2 p.m.
[01:32:33.738 --> 01:32:34.679]  Central, then at 3 p.m.
[01:32:34.699 --> 01:32:35.040]  Central.
[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:54.340]   Owen Schroyer in the War Room right here on the InfoWars Radio/TV Network.
[01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:57.699]   The fight against the New World Order is now the top story in the world.
[01:32:57.730 --> 01:32:59.171]  The globalists are in deep trouble.
[01:32:59.491 --> 01:33:08.114]  But they're striking back with all their deep state operatives to shut down Infowars and other truth tellers like James O'Keefe and Tucker Carlson and countless others.
[01:33:08.594 --> 01:33:10.395]  So please pray for us now more than ever.

[01:33:54.278 --> 01:34:08.333]  So, in the last few months, Trump has really grown up a lot, taken the gloves off, and has said the New World Order wants to depopulate you, the New World Order wants to make you poor, the New World Order wants to destroy you and your family, the New World Order is coming after your children.
[01:34:08.693 --> 01:34:09.874]  It's either us or them.
[01:34:12.375 --> 01:34:14.197]  And that's a major game changer.
[01:34:14.217 --> 01:34:19.701]  I know people that have dinner with Trump, who talk to him all the time, they say he is, sounds like Alex Jones now.
[01:34:20.442 --> 01:34:28.008]  Used to, he had Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon writing his speeches, and they're anti-globalists, so it sounded really good, and Trump agreed with it, so he had them write the speeches.
[01:34:28.708 --> 01:34:30.650]  You don't need to write him the speeches now.
[01:34:32.371 --> 01:34:38.776]  And he is just getting rid of all the camp followers, Jared, Ivanka, all of them have been thrown to the side.
[01:34:39.727 --> 01:35:07.135]  So I'm not here cheerleading Trump, I'm taking your calls criticizing him, I'm agreeing with the criticism, but I'm saying he is on an upward arc and if he would just come out against the shots, and he's come out against forced injection, he's come out against Fauci more and more, he is coming out against the military being made to take it, that's all fine and dandy, but now it's come out it was made in a lab, but we know the Pentagon was involved, they're trying to frame America for what the globalists did.
[01:35:08.959 --> 01:35:10.419]  And China wasn't behind it.
[01:35:10.439 --> 01:35:12.500]  They were involved, mid-level, but not running it.
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:16.361]  And you've heard Dr. Redfield say it, the former head of the CDC.
[01:35:17.541 --> 01:35:19.202]  They're positioning Trump for the fall.
[01:35:19.242 --> 01:35:21.962]  So we're having that bigger discussion.
[01:35:21.982 --> 01:35:23.923]  But last week, I meant to get to this, I didn't.
[01:35:23.963 --> 01:35:25.823]  He did a whole 15-minute intro on it.
[01:35:25.843 --> 01:35:27.104]  I'm going to play a short clip.
[01:35:27.644 --> 01:35:31.745]  Tucker Carlson comes out and says, the elites think there's too many people on Earth.
[01:35:32.947 --> 01:35:39.651]  They have 510 kids, they have jumbo jets, they have palatial mansions, but they say you can't have life, you can't have therapeutics.
[01:35:40.391 --> 01:35:41.932]  How fundamental is that?
[01:35:41.952 --> 01:35:51.558]  That the globalists are not egalitarians, the globalists aren't caring about people, they've broken the social contract and they're out to get us, and they're the globalist party.
[01:35:51.878 --> 01:35:54.740]  They're the party of Deimos, they're the New World Order, they're the enemy.
[01:35:56.178 --> 01:36:15.212]  And so to have everybody from Bill Maher to Tucker Carlson to Russell Brand to Joe Rogan sounding just like Alex Jones now shows us that what I've said a thousand times, and I'll say it very slowly, I know the listeners have gotten this, we have new listeners every five seconds or every second tuning in, but I want to be very clear.
[01:36:18.203 --> 01:36:35.051]  There are libertarian parties, and there are conservative parties, and there are liberal parties, and there are transgender parties, and there are Baptist parties, and there are Catholic parties, and there are environmental groups, and there are thousands of different worldviews, and thousands of different political ideas, and all the Hollywood garbage.
[01:36:36.712 --> 01:36:53.085]   But when it comes down to the New World Order, and globalism, and transhumanism, and their plan, I'm telling you the globalist operation, I'm telling you what the dominant group on Earth Once for humanity, and it's a horrible future for 99.999999% of us.
[01:36:53.245 --> 01:36:58.869]  It's not even good for the few thousand globalists that own and run things.
[01:36:58.890 --> 01:36:59.430]  They're fraud.
[01:37:01.972 --> 01:37:20.585]   So, when the public gets we have a predatory group that's hijacked the country and the world, that's out to get us, and that everything they push from central bank digital currencies, to poison shots, to bugs, to GMOs, and the minute we say, whatever you're promoting, we're against it, Yeah, there's Bill Gates and others at a World Government Summit.
[01:37:22.305 --> 01:37:26.946]  Or Bill Gates' dad, pushing at a depopulation summit.
[01:37:28.606 --> 01:37:37.969]  Headline, London Guardian, Billionaire Elites Meet in Secret to Discuss World Government Depopulation Plans.
[01:37:37.989 --> 01:37:40.409]  2009, Wall Street Journal, London Guardian.
[01:37:40.849 --> 01:37:41.249]  Pull it up.
[01:37:43.410 --> 01:37:47.871]  Global Elites Billionaires Meet in Secret to Discuss World Government Depopulation Plans.
[01:37:51.158 --> 01:37:52.019]  They put that out.
[01:37:52.059 --> 01:37:53.099]  They're proud of themselves.
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:38:06.929]  And you expose that and realize that almost all the bad stuff happening, the dumbing down of the children, the fentanyl, the open borders, the cutting off the energy, all of it is a New World Order policy and you admit that.
[01:38:09.852 --> 01:38:12.253]  It's game over for them.
[01:38:12.273 --> 01:38:14.595]  Yeah, the crew found the Times of London.
[01:38:14.655 --> 01:38:15.436]  Just search web.
[01:38:17.179 --> 01:38:21.222]  Billionaire Club meets in secret to discuss overpopulation.
[01:38:21.242 --> 01:38:22.343]  That'll give me the Wall Street Journal.
[01:38:24.225 --> 01:38:27.808]  Billionaires meet in secret to discuss saving the earth through depopulation.
[01:38:28.248 --> 01:38:28.889]  London Guardian.
[01:38:31.711 --> 01:38:37.957]  And then you realize that is the rationale for all the bad things they do is, well we're a bunch of cockroaches, we deserve to die.
[01:38:38.377 --> 01:38:43.681]  And anyone playing along with their agenda who acts like you're a savior or a good person is a fool!
[01:38:44.042 --> 01:38:45.343]  You are being targeted!
[01:38:47.489 --> 01:38:49.310]  Here's Tucker Carlson last week talking about it.
[01:38:50.010 --> 01:38:54.572]  And no one at the UN, by the way, cares about the data, where it came from, because the real goal has nothing to do with the environment.
[01:38:54.772 --> 01:38:55.392]  Of course!
[01:38:55.873 --> 01:38:56.213]  Duh!
[01:38:56.653 --> 01:38:57.653]  Look at the pollution!
[01:38:58.174 --> 01:39:00.655]  If you cared about the environment, this is a tough time to live.
[01:39:01.755 --> 01:39:10.839]  But ever since Julian Huxley took over UNESCO in the 1940s, pushing Malthusianism, the idea that the world's overpopulated has been the dominant way of thinking for the people in charge.
[01:39:10.899 --> 01:39:14.560]  Except, with respect to their own families, they have as many kids as they want.
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:15.401]  But you're not allowed to.
[01:39:16.121 --> 01:39:28.786]  And that leads to moments like the one we saw a month ago where the Harvard historian, Naomi Oreskes, wrote an op-ed in Scientific American entitled, 8 Billion People in the World is a Crisis, Not an Achievement!
[01:39:29.787 --> 01:39:32.468]  Well, if you're one of those 8 billion, that seems like hostility.
[01:39:33.068 --> 01:39:39.880]   If some chick is writing a piece in a science magazine about how your existence is bad, That might make you nervous, right?
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:41.160]  It should.
[01:39:42.341 --> 01:39:48.043]  And it may explain why these people oppose nuclear energy, which seems like a solution, but they're against that too.
[01:39:49.004 --> 01:39:51.705]  So it's not really about carbon emissions, is it?
[01:39:51.925 --> 01:39:54.926]  It's about hurting people, specific people.
[01:39:54.966 --> 01:39:56.387]  They think there are too many people.
[01:39:57.687 --> 01:39:59.348]  And this view is very widespread.
[01:39:59.368 --> 01:40:02.830]  It's why the leaders of the Democratic Party are always in your face, telling you to get an abortion!
[01:40:02.850 --> 01:40:04.030]  Hurry up and get an abortion!
[01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:04.851]  It'll help the GDP!
[01:40:07.890 --> 01:40:08.651]  Predatory.
[01:40:11.052 --> 01:40:11.753]  Aggressive.
[01:40:14.535 --> 01:40:15.356]  Out to get you.
[01:40:15.636 --> 01:40:16.496]  Want to hurt you.
[01:40:16.757 --> 01:40:18.037]  Want to depopulate you.
[01:40:18.898 --> 01:40:23.361]  Just admit there are powerful rich people that see the general public as scum.
[01:40:23.421 --> 01:40:34.229]  Again, I go back to the hieroglyphs in Egypt of Ramses I. The exodus of the Jews was Ramses II 30 years later.
[01:40:35.959 --> 01:40:36.379]  Moses.
[01:40:36.499 --> 01:40:37.340]  All that's a true story.
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.841]  It's not just the Jewish text, it's in the Egyptian writings.
[01:40:41.122 --> 01:40:44.544]  And Ramses I said, I want every first-born male Jew killed.
[01:40:46.466 --> 01:40:47.366]  Below the age of five.
[01:40:50.608 --> 01:40:51.909]  Think that pissed people off a little?
[01:40:51.949 --> 01:40:52.409]  But he did it.
[01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:59.674]  And what do you think all the transgenderism, sterilizing our boys, and the Ritalin for our boys, it's all an attack on our future.
[01:41:00.434 --> 01:41:04.717]  Everything that's happened before is just happening again in a newer, more modern, disgusting way.
[01:41:06.343 --> 01:41:09.787]  Here's Joe Rogan with a guest talking about Alex Jones as the ultimate evil.
[01:41:09.887 --> 01:41:11.709]  Alex Jones is the dirtiest person on ever.
[01:41:12.249 --> 01:41:15.232]  We're questioning events and saying could they be staged?
[01:41:15.753 --> 01:41:19.136]  But what about media and government lying about WMDs and killing millions?
[01:41:19.417 --> 01:41:19.877]  Here's the clip.
[01:41:23.959 --> 01:41:24.459]  Ridiculous.
[01:41:24.799 --> 01:41:26.480]  I remember when I watched it.
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:27.920]  I watched it on TV.
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:29.501]  You remember that night when we opened bombing?
[01:41:29.521 --> 01:41:29.681]  Oh yeah.
[01:41:29.861 --> 01:41:30.841]  It was just on the news.
[01:41:30.941 --> 01:41:31.342]  I remember.
[01:41:31.362 --> 01:41:33.562]  We were like, here's us fucking up some other city.
[01:41:33.662 --> 01:41:33.903]  Yeah.
[01:41:34.143 --> 01:41:34.683]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:41:34.703 --> 01:41:36.583]  We watched it and I was like... You see the tracer missiles?
[01:41:36.623 --> 01:41:36.804]  Yeah.
[01:41:36.824 --> 01:41:40.125]  I remember being a kid and being like, this is fucking weird.
[01:41:40.225 --> 01:41:40.565]  Yeah.
[01:41:42.466 --> 01:41:43.486]  It was fucking weird.
[01:41:44.266 --> 01:41:44.706]  It's weird.
[01:41:44.746 --> 01:41:58.458]   What's really crazy is that they never showed the evidence of weapons of mass destruction that They should have had something that would let them go to war, but they never had any real evidence.
[01:41:58.578 --> 01:42:02.480]  Hey, remember when Alex Jones got sued for a billion dollars?
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:03.321]  More.
[01:42:03.701 --> 01:42:09.625]  And then the people that killed a million people in Iraq didn't face any repercussions?
[01:42:09.885 --> 01:42:10.265]  Crazy.
[01:42:10.445 --> 01:42:11.045]  What a time.
[01:42:11.906 --> 01:42:12.426]  What a time.
[01:42:13.187 --> 01:42:13.427]  Huh?
[01:42:13.447 --> 01:42:14.027]  Isn't that nuts?
[01:42:15.885 --> 01:42:17.187]  And then that's... What the heck?
[01:42:17.247 --> 01:42:18.850]  What's the real misinformation?
[01:42:18.910 --> 01:42:19.891]  I said, what the heck?
[01:42:20.071 --> 01:42:20.392]  Yeah.
[01:42:21.053 --> 01:42:23.957]  Also, like, the news media went along with it.
[01:42:24.058 --> 01:42:26.862]  Alex Jones got sued for a billion dollars.
[01:42:26.882 --> 01:42:27.323]  A billion.
[01:42:27.363 --> 01:42:27.783]  Like, $965 million.
[01:42:27.803 --> 01:42:29.025]  But there's more, too.
[01:42:29.546 --> 01:42:30.487]  There's more judgments.
[01:42:31.721 --> 01:42:32.541]  That part's funny.
[01:42:33.082 --> 01:42:34.382]  See what I mean, though?
[01:42:34.703 --> 01:42:37.844]  The funny part is them going, a billion dollars.
[01:42:38.525 --> 01:42:38.705]  What?
[01:42:39.886 --> 01:42:47.990]  The funny part is that, but the people that said there was weapons of mass destruction, and then the people that perpetrated that lie, nothing.
[01:42:49.891 --> 01:42:50.151]  Nothing.
[01:42:50.171 --> 01:42:52.633]  It leads to the destruction of... The failing New York Times?
[01:42:53.213 --> 01:42:53.933]  No repercussions.
[01:42:54.274 --> 01:42:54.534]  Nothing.
[01:42:55.796 --> 01:42:58.637]  But that's how they absolve themselves by saying, I'm bad.
[01:42:58.957 --> 01:43:00.017]  They can all be the good guys.
[01:43:00.037 --> 01:43:00.838]  Here's Madeleine Albright.
[01:43:00.858 --> 01:43:01.298]  We'll go to break.
[01:43:01.318 --> 01:43:04.879]  Come back with your calls.
[01:43:04.939 --> 01:43:07.320]  We have heard that half a million children have died.
[01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:12.582]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[01:43:13.362 --> 01:43:16.603]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[01:43:17.663 --> 01:43:22.305]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.
[01:43:24.582 --> 01:43:26.303]  Because they're the good guys, I'm the bad guy.
[01:43:27.023 --> 01:43:30.906]  Your phone calls are just minutes away.
[01:43:31.886 --> 01:43:35.609]  Here on the most lied-about, demonized broadcast in the world.
[01:43:36.604 --> 01:43:37.645]  All right, we're going back to your calls.
[01:43:37.665 --> 01:43:38.726]  Let me just say this briefly.
[01:43:38.746 --> 01:43:41.368]  I want to give you a status report on InfoWars.
[01:43:42.248 --> 01:43:45.651]  We came within inches of being shut down six months ago.
[01:43:46.311 --> 01:43:56.799]  I had to put every dime I had in as emergency backup just to stabilize things with all the trials and all the costs and all the expenses and barely buy enough product into the future.
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:59.542]  That's how we fund ourselves to be able to stay on air.
[01:43:59.922 --> 01:44:02.664]  The budget is barely working, but we're here.
[01:44:03.641 --> 01:44:04.461]  So I'm not complaining.
[01:44:04.561 --> 01:44:12.065]  The problem is we had to buy so limited amounts of products that you buy them and then there's not enough money.
[01:44:13.185 --> 01:44:14.446]  But we've got the numbers.
[01:44:14.506 --> 01:44:15.866]  Top accountants have looked at it all.
[01:44:16.527 --> 01:44:19.468]  If people just continue to support at the level you've been doing, we're going to make it.
[01:44:20.268 --> 01:44:22.629]  But I'd like to bring back so many products listeners have noticed.
[01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:23.970]  Almost all the other products are gone.
[01:44:24.847 --> 01:44:26.308]  My dad put his money forward.
[01:44:26.929 --> 01:44:28.730]  Only makes like a dollar a tube on this.
[01:44:29.631 --> 01:44:32.853]  And made a great turmeric toothpaste, but he only got 12,000 tubes.
[01:44:33.754 --> 01:44:34.815]  It's almost sold out.
[01:44:35.175 --> 01:44:35.856]  It's a big hit.
[01:44:36.496 --> 01:44:37.817]  It does amazing things for your body.
[01:44:38.578 --> 01:44:42.001]  And we're going to take all the money that comes in from that and try to buy 20,000 tubes.
[01:44:42.881 --> 01:44:44.563]  And then have that for the next six months or so.
[01:44:45.691 --> 01:44:54.554]  But when you sell something like this and only make like $5, $6 a tube, because there's no fillers, it's full of essential oils, it's incredible, you've got to sell a lot of it.
[01:44:55.434 --> 01:45:02.136]  We have plenty of the Great Reset and the War for the World unsigned, and we have the sign that's a fundraiser, only a few hundred left.
[01:45:02.656 --> 01:45:03.836]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:45:05.017 --> 01:45:07.657]  And the shirt, Alex Jones for President.
[01:45:08.258 --> 01:45:09.238]  I knew it would be a hit shirt.
[01:45:10.339 --> 01:45:11.439]  They said, sorry, the budget's $5,000.
[01:45:11.479 --> 01:45:14.040]  We started selling it last Wednesday.
[01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:15.861]  It'll be sold out today.
[01:45:16.441 --> 01:45:17.261]  More has been ordered.
[01:45:17.601 --> 01:45:18.382]  Made here in America.
[01:45:18.422 --> 01:45:19.442]  It'll be here within two weeks.
[01:45:20.242 --> 01:45:21.963]  So when you do your order, you don't get charged.
[01:45:22.503 --> 01:45:23.804]  It's a pre-order.
[01:45:24.484 --> 01:45:26.484]  And then as soon as it comes in and it ships, you get charged.
[01:45:26.524 --> 01:45:27.425]  So still be able to get the shirt.
[01:45:28.285 --> 01:45:30.406]  But we're going to do one more big run of them and that's it.
[01:45:30.446 --> 01:45:31.186]  It's a limited edition.
[01:45:31.506 --> 01:45:37.228]  But when the shirt is sold today, you will get it this week because we still have it in stock.
[01:45:37.588 --> 01:45:39.389]  Get your Alex Jones for President shirt today.
[01:45:40.441 --> 01:45:46.889]  Because I literally have to go show the bankruptcy people, hey look, we sold out of these in five, six days, can I order more now?
[01:45:47.369 --> 01:45:56.720]  And I'm not bitching, it's just that's the kind of stuff I gotta do here to, you know, and I want this to be a huge shirt, I think it should be a hit shirt, it is a hit shirt, people love it.
[01:45:57.688 --> 01:46:02.855]  Separately, we finally have high quality storable foods at the lowest price you're going to find.

[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:08.843]  Lower than the great American company that makes the food.

[01:46:24.498 --> 01:46:25.519]  CBD oil is the best.

[01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:30.283]  InfowarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:46:30.864 --> 01:46:31.244]  All right.
[01:46:32.565 --> 01:46:34.707]  Let's go to all these callers.
[01:46:34.807 --> 01:46:35.788]  Bam, bam, bam.
[01:46:35.868 --> 01:46:37.149]  Candice in Tennessee.
[01:46:37.169 --> 01:46:38.210]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:46:39.872 --> 01:46:40.172]  Hi.
[01:46:41.213 --> 01:46:41.493]  Thank you.
[01:46:43.592 --> 01:46:45.993]  I have voted for Trump in 2016.
[01:46:46.113 --> 01:46:48.393]  I supported him from the beginning of his campaign.
[01:46:48.453 --> 01:46:49.853]  I voted for him in 2020.
[01:46:49.933 --> 01:46:55.295]  And I love what he has come out and said recently about being against the New World Order and taking down the deep state.
[01:46:55.695 --> 01:47:02.116]  But if he doesn't stop talking mothers like me into giving children these poison shots, I don't think I can vote for him in 24.
[01:47:02.416 --> 01:47:05.397]  I agree.
[01:47:05.477 --> 01:47:08.897]  So that's the number one issue, hurting him, plus hurting our children, which is more important.
[01:47:09.318 --> 01:47:11.498]  Why in the hell won't he admit he's wrong?
[01:47:12.831 --> 01:47:13.351]  Exactly.
[01:47:13.491 --> 01:47:15.352]  That is the biggest thing holding me back.
[01:47:15.412 --> 01:47:17.273]  We are all human and we all make mistakes.
[01:47:17.373 --> 01:47:21.295]  It's time to admit it, own it, and stop having mothers murder their own children.
[01:47:23.096 --> 01:47:23.477]  I agree.
[01:47:23.517 --> 01:47:25.978]  Who are you going to support if Trump doesn't come out against the shot?
[01:47:27.439 --> 01:47:35.943]  I was going to support DeSantis, but with everything coming out about him lately and all his connections to Soros money and Bush money, I think I'm all for Rand Paul.
[01:47:37.284 --> 01:47:39.125]  Yeah, Rand Paul's really the pure guy.
[01:47:39.145 --> 01:47:40.426]  He's 100% real.
[01:47:41.027 --> 01:47:44.029]  And I wish Trump would listen to him more.
[01:47:44.049 --> 01:47:46.630]  I agree, I do too.
[01:47:46.931 --> 01:47:50.973]  I think he could learn a lot from Rand Paul and just being humble and owning when he has messed up.
[01:47:51.013 --> 01:47:51.814]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:47:52.054 --> 01:47:55.396]  If Trump picks some VP like Pence this time, I'm gonna be mad.
[01:47:56.579 --> 01:48:00.701]  I think we should draft Rand Paul now and just hammer that, because we're the big Trump base.
[01:48:00.741 --> 01:48:01.501]  The enemy knows that.
[01:48:01.901 --> 01:48:03.462]  We should all be influencing Trump.
[01:48:03.502 --> 01:48:04.563]  How do you think we influence Trump?
[01:48:04.883 --> 01:48:07.484]  I think we say, you better pick a General Flynn or a Rand Paul.
[01:48:08.264 --> 01:48:10.425]  Then we can trust him more if he had a good VP.
[01:48:11.786 --> 01:48:13.306]  That's very true.
[01:48:13.587 --> 01:48:17.148]  Because even if he won't come out against the shot, we can say, OK, you don't want to admit you were wrong.
[01:48:17.508 --> 01:48:19.109]  You think it'll double back and bite in the ass.
[01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:23.951]  OK, show us that you mean, show us as a little code.
[01:48:23.991 --> 01:48:25.252]  In fact, I can get Trump on the phone.
[01:48:25.272 --> 01:48:25.692]  I'm going to tell him.
[01:48:27.472 --> 01:48:32.194]  You need to go with Rand Paul or Flynn to show the base that you're hardcore now.
[01:48:32.234 --> 01:48:33.054]  Does that make sense?
[01:48:34.234 --> 01:48:34.474]  It does.
[01:48:34.534 --> 01:48:38.196]  And he's trying to reach mothers and middle-aged women in that demographic.
[01:48:38.296 --> 01:48:41.077]  And pushing these shots on our kids is not how you do that.
[01:48:42.057 --> 01:48:42.957]  I totally agree with you.
[01:48:42.997 --> 01:48:43.838]  Thank you, Candace.
[01:48:44.478 --> 01:48:45.919]  Wild in Wisconsin.
[01:48:45.959 --> 01:48:46.539]  You're on the air.
[01:48:47.979 --> 01:48:49.640]  Hi, Mr. Chainbreaker.
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:54.882]  I wanted to bounce theory off of you to see if you agree with me.
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:16.455]  Their establishment's using the same old tricks that always work and is going to do something similar with DeSantis and Trump like they did with Ross Perot using DeSantis Kirkland brand Trump to kind of siphon off votes from Trump and the Republican base so then Trump has no chance of winning.
[01:49:16.855 --> 01:49:20.178]  So like a vote for DeSantis is basically a vote for the Democrat.
[01:49:21.690 --> 01:49:29.294]  Yeah, I mean, I like DeSantis' rhetoric and things he's done, but his pedigree is he came right out from between the legs of George Herbert Walker Bush.
[01:49:30.934 --> 01:49:43.020]  And then he also, like, kind of mimics Trump a lot in his mannerisms, and he's kind of trying to mimic Trump's style and everything, which makes me feel more that he's a plant.
[01:49:43.500 --> 01:50:02.149]   And with Trump driving the left so crazy and, you know, driving them up the wall and wild, You know, I think it's more about redemption at this point, and that if he gets in, it's going to be more like a revenge, because a revenge for all the people who have died from the clot shot.
[01:50:06.147 --> 01:50:13.713]  I mean, I think you're on target, brother, and that's why we're opening the phones up about Trump, because I am not a person that does what I think's wrong.
[01:50:14.434 --> 01:50:16.876]  And I've really had nightmares about Trump.
[01:50:16.956 --> 01:50:17.976]  I mean, I'm serious.
[01:50:18.016 --> 01:50:20.338]  I have dreams about it all the time, like four or five times a week.
[01:50:21.059 --> 01:50:22.300]  I don't know the right thing to do.
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:23.521]  I care about the audience.
[01:50:24.061 --> 01:50:24.922]  I see the rallies.
[01:50:25.002 --> 01:50:26.203]  Our people are at those rallies.
[01:50:26.643 --> 01:50:28.104]  He's doing so many good things.
[01:50:28.144 --> 01:50:38.429]   And then there's this, again, it's like you get a delicious bowl of soup at the restaurant, and then there is a Yeah, Terry.
[01:50:38.849 --> 01:50:41.248]   You go to the waiter and you say, "Will you give me another bowl?"
[01:50:41.248 --> 01:50:42.768]  They go, "Oh, flies are good for you."
[01:50:42.768 --> 01:50:46.048]  And I'm like, "Just bring me another bowl, man.
[01:50:46.048 --> 01:50:48.128]  Admit the flies in the freaking soup.
[01:50:48.128 --> 01:50:49.248]  Bring me another bowl."
[01:50:49.248 --> 01:50:50.849]  Like, "Oh no, you don't like flies?"
[01:50:50.849 --> 01:50:53.809]  And so I'm kind of like, "Yeah, Trump, I don't like flies."
[01:50:53.809 --> 01:50:55.328]  Does that make sense?
[01:50:55.328 --> 01:50:57.009]  Yeah, Terry, get in the phone.
[01:50:57.009 --> 01:50:57.649]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:57.649 --> 01:51:04.769]   All right, I am continuing on with your phone calls on this Live Monday edition of the transmission.
[01:51:04.966 --> 01:51:08.010]  We're having a really good in-depth discussion here.
[01:51:10.222 --> 01:51:11.842]  And I don't control my reporters.
[01:51:11.902 --> 01:51:19.084]  I respect them and I like their different perspectives because they help us have a deeper debate about the situation in the world today.
[01:51:19.904 --> 01:51:27.306]  And last week I was very critical of Trump and his baseball bat images and death and destruction if I get indicted.
[01:51:27.486 --> 01:51:28.606]  We're winning this politically.
[01:51:28.666 --> 01:51:29.587]  We don't want violence.
[01:51:30.027 --> 01:51:31.247]  We saw what happened with January 6th.
[01:51:31.287 --> 01:51:38.069]   So before I get into all this January 6th footage, I want to air Trump threatens death and destruction, a Gregg Reeves report.
[01:51:38.089 --> 01:51:39.289]  It's about four minutes long.
[01:51:40.009 --> 01:51:43.210]  I want to come back and play some of these new January 6th clips.
[01:51:43.230 --> 01:51:47.651]  And then we're going to continue with your phone calls.
[01:51:47.732 --> 01:51:52.133]  But here is the latest report on something that I'm worried about with Trump.
[01:51:51.953 --> 01:52:06.273]  Here it is.
[01:52:06.342 --> 01:52:10.243]  on January 6th, urging his supporters to be there.
[01:52:10.544 --> 01:52:11.324]  We'll be wild.
[01:52:12.064 --> 01:52:17.846]  On January 6th, InfoWars was invited to help bring the crowd to the Capitol building.
[01:52:18.266 --> 01:52:19.767]  Where Trump would give a speech.
[01:52:20.227 --> 01:52:24.730]  To do this, we were formally escorted out of his official speech early.
[01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:33.415]  InfoWars was shown a map of the Capitol grounds, with a stage on the backside where we were to lead the crowd to meet President Trump.
[01:52:34.096 --> 01:52:40.580]  When we arrived, there was no stage, but there was a false flag being executed by the FBI.
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:49.684]  Trump never showed up, and he turned his back on the hundreds of innocent supporters rotting away in jail for being at the Capitol that day.
[01:52:50.605 --> 01:53:01.970]  All this, on top of his constant shilling for the deadly Pfizer shots, has caused many objective Americans to see Trump as potentially another tool of the shadow government.
[01:53:02.551 --> 01:53:10.275]  And so last week, when Trump announced that he was going to be arrested and called for protests, many people saw it as a red flag.
[01:53:11.095 --> 01:53:18.981]  While the world economy is collapsing, Trump and the media are there together as a mindless distraction all week long.
[01:53:19.722 --> 01:53:24.866]  And on early Friday morning, Trump threatens death and destruction if he is arrested.
[01:53:25.734 --> 01:53:29.055]  This should be a major red flag, but many can't see it.
[01:53:29.515 --> 01:53:36.737]  Shortly after being elected in 2016, he begins to tell the crowd an anecdotal story about the Clintons.
[01:53:37.177 --> 01:53:43.439]  And when they start chanting, lock her up, he admits that was all just empty rhetoric to get elected.
[01:53:43.459 --> 01:53:46.600]  Scheduled Michigan unexpectedly.
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:53.442]  It was like all of a sudden with President Obama and Michelle and Bill and Hillary and they were going to Michigan.
[01:53:53.462 --> 01:53:55.263]  Now, it's okay.
[01:53:56.530 --> 01:53:56.990]  Forget it.
[01:53:58.492 --> 01:54:00.874]  That plays great before the election.
[01:54:00.914 --> 01:54:02.115]  Nah, we don't care, right?
[01:54:03.266 --> 01:54:08.188]  The Trump loyalists will claim that he was joking or he didn't mean it.
[01:54:08.688 --> 01:54:12.209]  They are likely blinded to all the glaring red flags.
[01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:16.151]  This is how the divide and conquer game works.
[01:54:16.731 --> 01:54:17.411]  Tribalism.
[01:54:17.951 --> 01:54:21.793]  And for many, America first became Trump first.
[01:54:22.513 --> 01:54:27.235]  Acting as if completely ignorant to the fact that our elections are rigged.
[01:54:28.015 --> 01:54:36.702]  The ultimate objective of controlled opposition would be to control the leader of the opposition so that you can lead the opposition over a cliff.
[01:54:37.402 --> 01:54:40.785]  Whether or not this is Trump, he is not America.
[01:54:41.325 --> 01:54:43.187]  We the people are America.
[01:54:43.787 --> 01:54:50.230]  And the only way we the people win is to get active, put our faith in God, and unite.
[01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:55.973]  Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.
[01:54:56.573 --> 01:55:07.398]  And while the nation is being destroyed by the federal government, millions of Americans are focusing on a 2024 election that we already know will be rigged more than ever.
[01:55:08.038 --> 01:55:09.479]  This is insane behavior.
[01:55:10.019 --> 01:55:15.681]  We need to stop seeing politics as a spectator sport and start actually getting involved.
[01:55:16.161 --> 01:55:23.163]  If we are unwilling to take control of our local governments, then why should anyone listen to our grievances with the federal government?
[01:55:24.064 --> 01:55:31.066]  What originally made Trump popular was an overall disdain for our government and a love for America.
[01:55:31.566 --> 01:55:33.367]  And this is all we need to be focused on.
[01:55:34.167 --> 01:55:48.167]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:55:48.162 --> 01:55:49.442]  So there's a bunch of these videos.
[01:55:49.462 --> 01:55:50.703]  There's like an hour of this.
[01:55:51.283 --> 01:55:53.404]  So I'm not going to play it all because I want to go back to your calls.
[01:55:53.484 --> 01:55:58.807]  But here's an article that went up yesterday on Infowars.com on Sunday.
[01:55:59.187 --> 01:55:59.887]  Go, go, go.
[01:55:59.967 --> 01:56:00.647]  Help them up.
[01:56:00.727 --> 01:56:01.388]  Push them up.
[01:56:01.808 --> 01:56:06.230]  Newly January 6 footage shows DC Metro cop encouraging people to go towards the Capitol.
[01:56:06.730 --> 01:56:07.250]  Here's another one.
[01:56:07.290 --> 01:56:15.015]  Dirty cops, dirty media revealed undercover police helped steal police riot shields and pass through broken glass doors on January 6th.
[01:56:15.656 --> 01:56:17.136]  And then here's a 10-minute video.
[01:56:17.437 --> 01:56:19.158]  20 confirmed instances of operations.
[01:56:19.638 --> 01:56:25.061]  The dozens of feds, FBI agents, and state operatives who infiltrated the Trump crowds on January 6th at the U.S.
[01:56:25.081 --> 01:56:27.062]  Capitol and led the protests.
[01:56:28.183 --> 01:56:30.945]  So it's all right there.
[01:56:31.125 --> 01:56:36.125]  Ray Epps 2.0, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.1 thousand.
[01:56:36.125 --> 01:56:41.884]  And you're like, yeah, we know January 6th was my turn.
[01:56:41.938 --> 01:56:50.951]  I know you know, but the whole Homeland Security system is coming after the American people on something they provocateured, something they made sure happened.
[01:56:51.632 --> 01:56:52.374]  Here's one of the clips.
[01:56:55.264 --> 01:56:55.885]  USA!
[01:56:57.506 --> 01:56:58.006]  USA!
[01:56:58.126 --> 01:56:58.406]  Go!
[01:56:58.426 --> 01:56:58.907]  Go!
[01:56:59.127 --> 01:57:00.207]  Let's go!
[01:57:00.487 --> 01:57:00.988]  Go!
[01:57:01.088 --> 01:57:02.689]  Help him up!
[01:57:07.352 --> 01:57:07.952]  Hold on!
[01:57:07.992 --> 01:57:08.112]  Wait!
[01:57:08.152 --> 01:57:09.413]  Push him up!
[01:57:09.453 --> 01:57:11.494]  Push him up!
[01:57:11.554 --> 01:57:14.016]  Help me break it!
[01:57:14.056 --> 01:57:14.616]  Come on!
[01:57:16.517 --> 01:57:17.137]  Let's go!
[01:57:17.218 --> 01:57:18.238]  Leave it!
[01:57:19.619 --> 01:57:21.600]  Everyone is fucking now!
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:31.440]  [INAUDIBLE]
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:36.879]   Come on man, let's go, so leave that [BLEEP]
[01:57:36.879 --> 01:57:46.880]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:57:43.849 --> 01:57:54.933]  Video after video of now confirmed DC Metro Police, not the Capitol Police, helping people get into the building, climb over the scaffold and go in.
[01:57:55.723 --> 01:57:57.684]  And there's a whole other group of videos.
[01:57:58.324 --> 01:57:59.765]  We're showing some of those here right now.
[01:57:59.845 --> 01:58:08.548]  But Dirty Cops, Dirty Media, Revealed, Undercover Police, Help Steal, Police Riot Shields, and Pass Through the Broken Glass.
[01:58:08.608 --> 01:58:09.088]  They did it.
[01:58:10.108 --> 01:58:11.149]  They hyped up the crowd.
[01:58:11.549 --> 01:58:20.574]   They had the other police fire tear gas at the Capitol Police to the Capitol Police shot their own police with tear gas.
[01:58:21.215 --> 01:58:22.375]  Just get this whole thing going.
[01:58:22.415 --> 01:58:27.597]  And this is just the dirty agenda that we're witnessing and what has unfolded here.
[01:58:28.697 --> 01:58:29.717]  And it's truly disgusting.
[01:58:29.737 --> 01:58:34.139]  And that's why Trump does not need to buy into this.
[01:58:35.543 --> 01:58:42.087]  That's why Trump needs to come out against any form of violence that's offensive, that's not defensive, because he gets spun.
[01:58:42.407 --> 01:58:44.529]  Plus, what does attacking random cops do?
[01:58:44.589 --> 01:58:46.390]  What does burning up a building do?
[01:58:46.570 --> 01:58:47.991]  No, that's what Antifa does.
[01:58:48.011 --> 01:58:48.992]  That's not what we do.
[01:58:49.832 --> 01:58:55.196]  And we've been very good as populists and nationalists and conservatives this entire time.
[01:58:56.717 --> 01:58:59.979]  We have done a very, very good job.
[01:59:01.135 --> 01:59:02.875]  Of not being violent, the left's been violent.
[01:59:03.175 --> 01:59:05.276]  And that's why the world is turning against them.
[01:59:05.296 --> 01:59:06.196]  Yeah, here's more video.
[01:59:07.016 --> 01:59:13.857]  I've now confirmed DC police, all dressed up, always behind the crowd, hyping to get people to ram through and go through.
[01:59:14.297 --> 01:59:15.478]  Just like Ray Epps.
[01:59:15.518 --> 01:59:21.759]  And now Ray Epps has got a Democratic Party law firm that actually the FBI is saying he's going to sue people that say he was a provocateur.
[01:59:22.099 --> 01:59:23.879]  He's there for days saying go in the Capitol.
[01:59:23.919 --> 01:59:25.419]  He's there that day saying it.
[01:59:25.679 --> 01:59:27.240]  He told the commission he didn't lie under oath.
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:29.120]  He said, I helped orchestrate the break-in.
[01:59:31.516 --> 01:59:34.278]  He sent text messages saying, I helped orchestrate this.
[01:59:34.738 --> 01:59:35.879]  Why is he protected?
[01:59:37.439 --> 01:59:38.540]  Why is this going on?
[01:59:39.621 --> 01:59:46.485]  Because there's a deep state war against America, and America has to wake up to it and reject it and say we're not part of it.
[01:59:46.505 --> 01:59:47.826]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[01:59:47.846 --> 01:59:49.507]  I'm going to come right back with when.
[01:59:50.547 --> 02:00:06.113]  And everybody else that is patiently holding like Mike and Phillip and Sylvia, your calls are all, Jose, Rusty, Josh, David, your calls are all coming up in just a few minutes after this break.
[02:00:06.653 --> 02:00:08.333]  I'm fighting as hard as I can to stay on air.
[02:00:08.353 --> 02:00:09.274]  I appreciate your prayers.
[02:00:09.334 --> 02:00:11.334]  InfoWars needs your prayers more than ever.
[02:00:11.374 --> 02:00:14.695]  The deep state is doing so many dirty tricks and so many lies against us.
[02:00:14.715 --> 02:00:17.276]  But at the end of the day, folks, we're going to make it out of this together.
[02:00:17.816 --> 02:00:18.896]  InfoWars.com.
[02:00:19.256 --> 02:00:20.476]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:00:21.417 --> 02:00:22.137]  We'll be right back.
[02:00:22.217 --> 02:00:25.518]  Band.Video and the URL that takes you to Band.Video is not being censored right now.
[02:00:25.978 --> 02:00:27.378]  Madmaxworld.tv.
[02:00:27.698 --> 02:00:28.258]  We'll be right back.
[02:00:28.278 --> 02:00:28.678]  Stay with us.
[02:00:29.779 --> 02:00:30.199]  All right.
[02:00:30.919 --> 02:00:32.599]  Taking your phone calls right now.
[02:00:32.739 --> 02:00:33.740]  When in Ohio?
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:34.320]  You're on the air.
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:34.660]  Go ahead.
[02:00:36.348 --> 02:00:36.868]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:36.968 --> 02:00:37.989]  Great to talk with you.
[02:00:38.009 --> 02:00:39.330]  Good to talk to you.
[02:00:40.671 --> 02:00:45.595]  I'm an artist and an attorney from Ohio, and I'm supporting Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[02:00:45.635 --> 02:00:46.315]  for president.
[02:00:47.116 --> 02:00:54.101]  He is a man of great integrity and a proven track record of tireless work for the greater public good.
[02:00:55.081 --> 02:00:57.843]  I do not think that Trump is the real deal.
[02:00:59.525 --> 02:01:06.621]   In my mind, seven words, Alex, absolutely disqualify Trump From serving as president again.
[02:01:06.681 --> 02:01:08.863]  Number one, border wall.
[02:01:09.323 --> 02:01:11.886]  Number two, Operation Warp Speed.
[02:01:12.306 --> 02:01:14.328]  And third, January 6th.
[02:01:15.769 --> 02:01:18.951]  And on Operation Warp Speed, I would pose a question.
[02:01:19.872 --> 02:01:33.143]  Why are we assuming that Trump, a shrewd businessman with decades of experience in the New York construction industry, was duped by the likes of Fauci, Birx, and Collins?
[02:01:33.956 --> 02:01:35.077]  It just doesn't make sense.
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:39.000]  Now I hear you.
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:41.122]  You're saying the poison shot is a deal-breaker.
[02:01:43.684 --> 02:01:48.768]  Well, I think it's strike two of three on the border wall.
[02:01:48.808 --> 02:01:56.735]  The Supreme Court allowed Trump to use $6 billion of DOD funds in Trump vs. Sierra Club back in July of 2019.
[02:01:57.936 --> 02:01:58.396]  He didn't.
[02:01:58.937 --> 02:01:59.477]  Why not?
[02:02:00.638 --> 02:02:03.100]  On Operation Warp Speed, I already spoke to that.
[02:02:03.923 --> 02:02:14.867]  And on January 6th, if you remember the Godfather, the traitor was the one who set up the meeting at which young Michael Corleone would be killed.
[02:02:15.927 --> 02:02:19.288]  Trump brought all the people to D.C.
[02:02:19.788 --> 02:02:20.869]  for the setup.
[02:02:21.269 --> 02:02:23.570]  And in my mind, that's strike number three.
[02:02:24.010 --> 02:02:24.330]  All right.
[02:02:24.690 --> 02:02:25.710]  Well said, sir.
[02:02:25.950 --> 02:02:27.331]  Mike, in New York, you're on the air.
[02:02:29.096 --> 02:02:32.218]  Hey Alex, so I just want to be realistic here.
[02:02:32.598 --> 02:02:37.501]  Do people really think, well first let me do this, is RFK going to run as a Democrat?
[02:02:38.682 --> 02:02:40.183]  We don't know yet, he says he may run.
[02:02:41.364 --> 02:02:44.626]  If he runs as a Democrat, let's be realistic, they're not going to let him get anywhere.
[02:02:45.766 --> 02:02:48.488]  Well they sure murdered his father in Los Angeles.
[02:02:49.529 --> 02:02:54.792]  Yeah, I mean the way that they got their elections set up in their county, he's not even going to smell anything.
[02:02:55.342 --> 02:02:58.203]  I mean, if they could do that to Bernie Sanders, imagine what they'll do to him.
[02:02:58.243 --> 02:03:00.184]  They'll make him irrelevant real quick.
[02:03:00.244 --> 02:03:01.144]  So let's drop that.
[02:03:02.024 --> 02:03:03.545]  I would love him, but let's drop that.
[02:03:04.425 --> 02:03:07.627]  Realistically, DeSantis doesn't stand a chance against Trump.
[02:03:07.967 --> 02:03:10.448]  Trump's gonna take him to the tool shed.
[02:03:11.108 --> 02:03:13.489]  Now, there's a lot of things with Trump I don't agree with.
[02:03:14.502 --> 02:03:20.465]  I mean, as far as the vaccine, and I'm hearing people calling and saying, Oh, he is convincing people to get the vaccine.
[02:03:20.905 --> 02:03:23.146]  Listen, you need to look in the mirror, right?
[02:03:23.206 --> 02:03:28.949]  Grab yourself by your bootstraps and grab some discernment and make decisions for yourself.
[02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:32.271]  I don't care what politicians told me what was right for me.
[02:03:32.591 --> 02:03:34.272]  I'm going to use my own judgment for everything.
[02:03:34.732 --> 02:03:41.115]  So if we're putting faith into politicians to give us life advice and guide us through life, then we're way far gone.
[02:03:41.315 --> 02:03:43.016]  I mean, we're basically leftist.
[02:03:43.056 --> 02:03:44.277]  That's how we're going to feel.
[02:03:44.844 --> 02:03:46.685]  You know, we need to look ourselves in the mirror.
[02:03:46.705 --> 02:03:49.567]  We need to start our own parallel everything.
[02:03:49.607 --> 02:03:51.248]  We need to prepare for the worst.
[02:03:51.848 --> 02:03:55.210]  You know, you can want the best, but you've got to get ready.
[02:03:55.470 --> 02:03:56.270]  We're at war here.
[02:03:56.991 --> 02:04:04.415]  You know, it seems like people are looking at these politicians like they're going to swoop in and save the day, and that's just not going to happen.
[02:04:04.495 --> 02:04:06.196]  Alright, Mike, I appreciate your call.
[02:04:06.396 --> 02:04:07.377]  That's why we're taking your calls.
[02:04:07.397 --> 02:04:08.277]  We want your perspective.
[02:04:08.317 --> 02:04:10.499]  Very, very, very thought-provoking.
[02:04:10.919 --> 02:04:12.480]  Phillip in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:12.780]  Go ahead.
[02:04:14.224 --> 02:04:14.764]  All right, Alex.
[02:04:15.745 --> 02:04:18.046]  Difference between President and Vice President.
[02:04:18.786 --> 02:04:20.607]  First President, Alex Jones.
[02:04:20.627 --> 02:04:22.167]  Of course, that's not going to happen.
[02:04:22.428 --> 02:04:24.729]  Well, I'm not seriously running the T-shirts just to have fun.
[02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:26.089]  I know it.
[02:04:26.169 --> 02:04:26.749]  It is fun.
[02:04:27.390 --> 02:04:29.291]  And second President is Donald Trump.
[02:04:30.051 --> 02:04:39.555]  So, reasonable, moderate capitalism versus over-the-top, full-blown totalitarianism masquerading as tender-hearted communism.
[02:04:41.011 --> 02:04:42.431]  One will win capitalism.
[02:04:42.471 --> 02:04:44.772]  The cost of the win is the issue.
[02:04:44.872 --> 02:04:48.753]  To win, we need two capitalists committed.
[02:04:49.193 --> 02:04:53.494]  President Trump and I'm nominating Vice President Peter Navarro.
[02:04:53.594 --> 02:04:54.894]  Maybe not a winning ticket.
[02:04:55.114 --> 02:04:55.494]  I don't know.
[02:04:55.534 --> 02:04:58.115]  Because Peter is the most loyal to Trump.
[02:04:58.655 --> 02:05:28.248]   And if Trump, you know, passes away or something, you know, his old age, whatever, Peter will stubbornly address the major issue of peace in our time, which is Promote free economy for the sake of individual rights and destroy communism, which is the plague of humanity, because it purports to manage its subservience rather than honoring its benefactors.
[02:05:28.868 --> 02:05:35.671]  Who, by sheer numbers, Mr. Biden, could storm the Bastille at any time?
[02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:39.449]  Well said, sir.
[02:05:39.509 --> 02:05:40.529]  I appreciate your call.
[02:05:41.069 --> 02:05:42.370]  Sylvia in Arkansas.
[02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:42.950]  You're on the air.
[02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:45.570]  Hi, Alex.
[02:05:45.690 --> 02:06:00.654]  I got on the Trump train back in 2015 when Donald Trump came down the escalator saying that drug trafficking and trying to curtail the drugs coming into this country and killing people were going to be his top priority.
[02:06:01.074 --> 02:06:02.815]  And I did see that.
[02:06:03.559 --> 02:06:11.381]  I just googled it and it said 932,000 people have died from drug overdoses since 1999.
[02:06:11.801 --> 02:06:20.704]  It's very concerning and if you have had a person in your family addicted to drugs then you feel the pain of that.
[02:06:21.104 --> 02:06:23.144]  So to me that is number one.
[02:06:23.164 --> 02:06:32.812]   And on the vaccines back in when the swine flu vaccine came out There were a lot of deaths and damages.
[02:06:32.852 --> 02:06:40.597]  They're not that many, but my mother said, do not ever be guilty of taking an untested vaccine, flu vaccine.
[02:06:40.897 --> 02:06:43.039]  I promised her faithfully, I would not.
[02:06:43.819 --> 02:06:46.961]  And throughout the years, I have not even taken a flu vaccine.
[02:06:46.981 --> 02:06:51.324]  So there's issues, there's issues with lots of vaccines.
[02:06:51.924 --> 02:06:57.388]  And if I was required to take a flu vaccine to hold a job, I would quit that job.
[02:06:58.101 --> 02:07:00.042]  Uh, because I think it's that serious.
[02:07:00.323 --> 02:07:05.606]  And when the doctor who encourages me to get the flu vaccine says, do you want the flu vaccine?
[02:07:05.646 --> 02:07:10.469]  I said, I promised my mother faithfully, I would not take it after the swine flu debacle.
[02:07:10.989 --> 02:07:15.052]  And they run out the door because they know there was a problem with that.
[02:07:15.532 --> 02:07:23.797]  My bottom line, you, Alex Jones and Donald Trump give a voice to the voiceless American people.
[02:07:24.398 --> 02:07:26.299]  And that's what I love about you guys.
[02:07:26.747 --> 02:07:30.949]  Maybe you guys are not perfect, but we have to do our own research.
[02:07:31.709 --> 02:07:35.850]  We have to do what we can to dig and get the truth.
[02:07:36.351 --> 02:07:38.691]  And the mandates were my problem.
[02:07:39.172 --> 02:07:45.594]  You know, I don't want to be mandated and I didn't see Trump mandate anything as far as the vaccine.
[02:07:45.854 --> 02:07:46.634]  Let me tell you something.
[02:07:46.794 --> 02:07:52.497]  There's a lot of mandates already to go to school, to work in the health industry.
[02:07:52.517 --> 02:07:55.478]  They've got to take flu vaccines and all that.
[02:07:57.982 --> 02:07:58.723]  I wouldn't do it.
[02:07:59.543 --> 02:08:00.544]  But now that's me.
[02:08:00.804 --> 02:08:04.567]  But everybody needs to do their own research and I agree with the caller previously.
[02:08:05.007 --> 02:08:05.767]  Look in the mirror.
[02:08:06.428 --> 02:08:09.470]  Do what you feel like is best for your life.
[02:08:10.110 --> 02:08:17.395]  Donald Trump or the health department in your state can try to force you or make you take all these things.
[02:08:18.376 --> 02:08:21.378]  But if you decide you do not want to, then don't.
[02:08:22.618 --> 02:08:24.720]  And I decided I don't want to.
[02:08:27.108 --> 02:08:27.648]  Absolutely.
[02:08:27.688 --> 02:08:30.470]  What's your view on Trump?
[02:08:30.970 --> 02:08:42.896]  Trump, if he continues with trying to fix the illegal immigration, which that's bringing now fentanyl and all this stuff, the deadly killers into this country, I'm going to give him a second chance.
[02:08:43.197 --> 02:08:45.798]  He didn't try to force anybody to take it.
[02:08:45.838 --> 02:08:51.688]   Maybe he did have the wrong perspective on these No, he was never for mandating it.
[02:08:51.708 --> 02:08:52.409]  I appreciate your call.
[02:08:52.469 --> 02:08:52.709]  All right.
[02:08:52.529 --> 02:08:57.729]   in the White House, we might have, if it was recommended by all the people, doctors and
[02:08:57.729 --> 02:09:02.208]   professionals who were supposed to know, you know, maybe we would have jumped on board
[02:09:02.208 --> 02:09:05.329]   and said, well, maybe we need to suggest that people take it.
[02:09:05.329 --> 02:09:08.448]  But he was not for mandating it, in my opinion.
[02:09:08.448 --> 02:09:09.449]  I didn't ever.
[02:09:09.449 --> 02:09:10.809]  No, he was never for mandating it.
[02:09:10.809 --> 02:09:12.048]  I appreciate your call.
[02:09:12.048 --> 02:09:13.048]  All right.
[02:09:13.048 --> 02:09:16.129]  Gerald Cilente is scheduled to take over.
[02:09:16.129 --> 02:09:18.489]   All these callers that are on hold, if you want to give us your name and number, we'll
[02:09:19.143 --> 02:09:19.923]  I'll be live tomorrow.
[02:09:19.943 --> 02:09:20.884]  We'll take calls again.
[02:09:21.484 --> 02:09:25.727]  Karen and Rusty and Josh and David and Jose, I'm out of time.
[02:09:26.527 --> 02:09:28.588]  The great Joe Celente always knocks you out of the park.
[02:09:28.628 --> 02:09:30.409]  Can't wait to hear what he has to say in the next hour.
[02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:37.593]  He is going to be taking over right after this two-minute break as we start our number four today.
[02:09:37.634 --> 02:09:47.550]   And then in 63 minutes from now, Owen Schroer, the indomitable, Patriot, the Cuck Slayer, will be live 3 p.m.
[02:09:47.570 --> 02:09:47.910]  Central.
[02:09:47.930 --> 02:09:49.031]  A bunch of news I didn't get to.
[02:09:49.051 --> 02:09:49.992]  We'll hit it tomorrow.
[02:09:50.412 --> 02:09:51.452]  We'll get to everything.
[02:09:51.793 --> 02:09:56.315]  But remember, InfoWars is only here because of you, so pray for us, and I appreciate all your support.
[02:09:57.355 --> 02:10:00.715]  Our number four starts right now.
[02:10:00.715 --> 02:10:11.034]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:11.034 --> 02:10:21.034]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:10:12.079 --> 02:10:15.641]  We have a new toothpaste that my dad, a retired dentist and oral surgeon developed.
[02:10:17.242 --> 02:10:20.604]  Dr. Jones Natural's Tumor Toothpaste that just came into stock.
[02:10:21.244 --> 02:10:24.146]  And I gotta tell ya, I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing.
[02:10:24.526 --> 02:10:28.028]  The way it makes your gums feel, what it does to your mouth is insane.
[02:10:28.488 --> 02:10:32.891]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant, an anti-inflammatory, and does such great things for the body.
[02:10:33.231 --> 02:10:36.134]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils.
[02:10:36.675 --> 02:10:37.696]  It is just dynamite.
[02:10:37.896 --> 02:10:42.140]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:46.404]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at InfoWorksStore.com.
[02:10:46.725 --> 02:10:49.247]  Dr. Jones Naturals Turmeric Toothpaste.
[02:10:49.447 --> 02:10:52.491]   And while you're at it, Check out the new Oshwagandha line of products.

[02:11:06.046 --> 02:11:08.048]  Take action now at m4warstore.com.
[02:11:11.877 --> 02:11:12.798]  It was not botched.
[02:11:13.458 --> 02:11:14.459]  It was not bungled.
[02:11:14.979 --> 02:11:16.019]  It was not a blunder.
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:18.281]  It was not incompetence.
[02:11:18.941 --> 02:11:20.422]  It was not lack of knowledge.
[02:11:20.962 --> 02:11:23.284]  It was not spontaneous mass hysteria.
[02:11:24.224 --> 02:11:26.586]  The planning occurred in plain sight.
[02:11:27.506 --> 02:11:30.388]  The planning is still occurring in plain sight.
[02:11:32.185 --> 02:11:34.227]  The philanthropists bought the science.
[02:11:34.987 --> 02:11:36.829]  The modelers projected the lies.
[02:11:37.530 --> 02:11:39.852]  The testers concocted the crisis.
[02:11:40.592 --> 02:11:43.094]  The NGOs leased the academics.
[02:11:43.114 --> 02:11:45.316]  COVID vaccines are now available for children.
[02:11:45.396 --> 02:11:47.898]  The scientists fabricated the findings.
[02:11:48.539 --> 02:11:50.901]  The mouthpieces spewed the talking points.
[02:11:51.001 --> 02:11:54.024]  A pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[02:11:54.104 --> 02:11:56.526]  The organizations declared the emergency.
[02:11:56.846 --> 02:11:59.127]  The voluntary phase is over.
[02:11:59.287 --> 02:12:01.148]  It's time for mandates.
[02:12:01.328 --> 02:12:03.109]  The governments erected the walls.
[02:12:03.469 --> 02:12:05.450]  The departments rewrote the rules.
[02:12:05.831 --> 02:12:10.173]  If you have travel plans, there is one more thing to add to your packing list.
[02:12:10.193 --> 02:12:11.854]  Proof of vaccination.
[02:12:12.414 --> 02:12:13.835]  Governors quashed the rights.
[02:12:14.455 --> 02:12:16.256]  The politicians passed the laws.
[02:12:16.976 --> 02:12:19.157]  The bankers installed the control grid.
[02:12:19.277 --> 02:12:21.839]  Individual carbon footprint tracker.
[02:12:22.259 --> 02:12:23.660]  The Stooges laundered the money.
[02:12:24.915 --> 02:12:26.496]  The DOD placed the orders.
[02:12:26.996 --> 02:12:31.317]  Is it likely that American tax dollars funded the gain of function research that created this virus?
[02:12:31.998 --> 02:12:36.639]  I think it did, not only from NIH, but from the State Department, USAID, and from DOD.
[02:12:37.099 --> 02:12:39.300]  The corporations fulfilled the contracts.
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:41.801]  Pfizer is making tons of money from its vaccine.
[02:12:42.041 --> 02:12:43.962]  The regulators approved the solution.
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:46.841]  The laws shielded the contractors.
[02:12:47.562 --> 02:12:49.523]  The agencies ignored the signal.
[02:12:49.603 --> 02:12:52.185]  She developed severe abdominal and chest pain.
[02:12:52.386 --> 02:12:54.407]  The behemoths consolidated the media.
[02:12:55.248 --> 02:12:57.449]  The psychologists crafted the messaging.
[02:12:57.650 --> 02:12:59.291]  Get the COVID vaccine!
[02:12:59.331 --> 02:13:01.593]  The propagandists chanted the slogans.
[02:13:02.574 --> 02:13:04.936]  The fact chokers smeared the dissidents.
[02:13:05.676 --> 02:13:07.778]  The censors silenced the questioners.
[02:13:07.898 --> 02:13:12.561]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors, and you silenced those voices.
[02:13:12.921 --> 02:13:15.182]  The jackboots stomped the dissenters.
[02:13:15.663 --> 02:13:23.368]  We will shut you down, we will cite you, and if we need to, we will arrest you and we will take you to jail.
[02:13:23.468 --> 02:13:24.569]  Screw your freedom.
[02:13:24.949 --> 02:13:34.274]  The tyrant summoned, the puppeteers jerked, the puppets danced, the colluders implemented, the doctors ordered, the hospitals administered.
[02:13:34.294 --> 02:13:44.359]  The menticide is scripted, the bamboozles bleated, the totalitarianized bullied, the covidians tattled, the parents surrendered.
[02:13:44.379 --> 02:13:47.460]  The hardest thing was I let him get that shot.
[02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:50.202]  The good citizens believed and forgot.
[02:13:51.422 --> 02:13:52.563]  This was calculated.
[02:13:52.584 --> 02:13:53.825]  This was formulated.
[02:13:54.065 --> 02:13:55.266]  This was focus-grouped.
[02:13:55.346 --> 02:13:56.427]  This was articulated.
[02:13:56.627 --> 02:13:57.748]  This was manufactured.
[02:13:57.768 --> 02:13:59.189]  This was falsified.
[02:13:59.289 --> 02:14:00.190]  This was coerced.
[02:14:00.290 --> 02:14:01.131]  This was inflicted.
[02:14:01.151 --> 02:14:02.032]  This was denied.
[02:14:02.052 --> 02:14:05.615]  Anybody who's lying here, Senator, it is you!
[02:14:05.995 --> 02:14:07.216]  We were terrorized.
[02:14:07.236 --> 02:14:08.618]  We were isolated.
[02:14:08.638 --> 02:14:09.939]  We were gaslit.
[02:14:10.079 --> 02:14:12.861]  You really need to get vaccinated.
[02:14:12.901 --> 02:14:14.102]  We were dehumanized.
[02:14:14.663 --> 02:14:15.484]  We were wounded.
[02:14:16.064 --> 02:14:16.925]  We were killed.
[02:14:21.159 --> 02:14:28.159]   Don't let them get away with it. Don't let them get away with it. Don't let them get away with it.
[02:14:28.159 --> 02:14:46.159]   I heard that it doesn't cure it and it doesn't stop you from getting it.
[02:14:46.119 --> 02:14:53.621]  On the very, very, very rare chance that you do get it, even if you're vaccinated, it's a very, you don't even feel sick.
[02:14:53.681 --> 02:14:55.342]  It's like you don't even know you got infected.
[02:14:55.422 --> 02:14:56.982]  Y'all campaign is about fear.
[02:14:57.422 --> 02:14:59.063]  It's about inciting fear in people.
[02:14:59.123 --> 02:15:00.803]  You all attack people with fear.
[02:15:01.004 --> 02:15:02.384]  That's what this pandemic is.
[02:15:02.624 --> 02:15:03.324]  It's a fear.
[02:15:03.384 --> 02:15:04.545]  It's fear, this pandemic.
[02:15:04.725 --> 02:15:05.265]  That's all it is.
[02:15:09.810 --> 02:15:13.363]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[02:15:18.092 --> 02:15:19.312]  I want you all to know something.
[02:15:19.432 --> 02:15:21.073]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:15:21.393 --> 02:15:24.814]  Alex is right about far more than is wrong.
[02:15:24.934 --> 02:15:27.855]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:15:27.875 --> 02:15:31.816]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:15:32.296 --> 02:15:34.097]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:15:34.497 --> 02:15:37.958]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:15:38.038 --> 02:15:41.499]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:15:41.779 --> 02:15:44.180]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:45.280]  Years ago.
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:48.681]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:15:49.761 --> 02:15:52.062]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:15:52.262 --> 02:15:54.603]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:15:54.703 --> 02:15:57.684]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:15:57.644 --> 02:16:03.604]   That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:16:03.604 --> 02:16:06.184]  (upbeat music)
[02:16:06.184 --> 02:16:10.284]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:16:10.264 --> 02:16:15.446]  I was going to talk about the economy, but I, you know, I didn't know that video was going to come up.
[02:16:16.267 --> 02:16:17.868]  And I want to follow up on that.
[02:16:18.828 --> 02:16:23.230]  There's a, um, an article that came out today.
[02:16:23.250 --> 02:16:23.290]  U.S.
[02:16:24.911 --> 02:16:28.512]  democracy, a facade, Russian security chief says.
[02:16:29.573 --> 02:16:33.955]  The United States is not really a democracy, nor does it seek to protect democracy.
[02:16:35.512 --> 02:16:37.573]  In its relations with other nations.
[02:16:37.713 --> 02:16:44.556]  Contrary to Washington's claims, senior Russian security official Petrushev said today.
[02:16:44.576 --> 02:16:47.738]  Yes, he's correct.
[02:16:47.838 --> 02:16:51.220]  United States, it's not a democracy, it's a facade.
[02:16:53.101 --> 02:16:55.582]  Look at the little freaks.
[02:16:56.402 --> 02:17:03.786]  The little arrogant boys and girls that they just showed on the video.
[02:17:05.467 --> 02:17:08.749]  Telling us you gotta get the jab.
[02:17:09.129 --> 02:17:10.870]  You gotta get the jab.
[02:17:11.290 --> 02:17:13.792]  A little gutless little clown.
[02:17:14.152 --> 02:17:17.093]  Boy, I'd love for him to tell me what to do.
[02:17:17.514 --> 02:17:19.255]  Little fraud Fauci.
[02:17:20.515 --> 02:17:21.676]  How about Gates?
[02:17:22.376 --> 02:17:23.637]  I tell you what, Gates.
[02:17:24.577 --> 02:17:30.481]  You could keep every billion dollars that you have if I look like you.
[02:17:31.582 --> 02:17:34.083]  Man, I'd rather be dead!
[02:17:34.363 --> 02:17:38.644]  You Vax Creep Freak!
[02:17:38.944 --> 02:17:40.444]  It's not a democracy!
[02:17:41.545 --> 02:17:52.688]  All they do is promote the drug dealers, the war machine, big pharma, drug dealers.
[02:17:54.289 --> 02:17:54.850]  That's it.
[02:17:55.390 --> 02:17:56.511]  Not a democracy.
[02:17:56.971 --> 02:17:58.312]  I'll tell you what to do.
[02:17:58.913 --> 02:18:02.696]  I'm arrogant Warren Wilhelm Jr.
[02:18:03.156 --> 02:18:04.878]  Yeah, you saw him in that video.
[02:18:05.498 --> 02:18:08.901]  That little freak who calls himself de Blasio.
[02:18:10.122 --> 02:18:10.442]  Yeah.
[02:18:11.583 --> 02:18:13.104]  You're not a de Blasio.
[02:18:13.445 --> 02:18:15.887]  You're Warren Wilhelm Jr.
[02:18:16.327 --> 02:18:21.171]  You changed your name to get the Italian-American vote in New York City.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.981]  I'm closing down everything.
[02:18:25.241 --> 02:18:26.881]  It's not a democracy.
[02:18:26.901 --> 02:18:33.483]  It's a draconian government that's robbed us out of our freedom and joy.
[02:18:35.503 --> 02:18:39.204]  Kingston was booming, man, before the COVID war.
[02:18:39.825 --> 02:18:40.885]  Now it's dead.
[02:18:41.725 --> 02:18:42.005]  Dead.
[02:18:42.545 --> 02:18:48.443]   And all those little freaky guys Dressed up in their police uniforms!
[02:18:48.803 --> 02:18:49.864]  You know what they're doing now?
[02:18:50.304 --> 02:18:52.025]  Because the streets are empty at night?
[02:18:53.566 --> 02:18:56.268]  They're stopping anybody that they can to see if you had a drink.
[02:18:57.309 --> 02:18:58.210]  And you know what they're doing?
[02:19:00.071 --> 02:19:08.017]  Three of my friends, within the last two days, got stopped.
[02:19:09.098 --> 02:19:09.718]  And you know why?
[02:19:11.679 --> 02:19:12.420]  Why'd you pull me over?
[02:19:14.372 --> 02:19:18.994]  You're supposed to put your signal light on a hundred feet before you reach the stop sign.
[02:19:20.354 --> 02:19:20.614]  What?
[02:19:22.015 --> 02:19:24.075]  Got to the stop sign, I put the signal light on.
[02:19:24.616 --> 02:19:26.496]  You have to obey the law.
[02:19:26.536 --> 02:19:27.136]  Where were you?
[02:19:27.897 --> 02:19:28.537]  Open your eyes.
[02:19:28.557 --> 02:19:30.237]  They're doing this test.
[02:19:30.618 --> 02:19:31.478]  Get out of your car.
[02:19:32.478 --> 02:19:33.559]  Walk a straight line.
[02:19:34.539 --> 02:19:36.080]  Repeat the alphabet backwards.
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:37.080]  Stand on your head.
[02:19:38.100 --> 02:19:38.380]  Yeah.
[02:19:39.181 --> 02:19:40.041]  That's what they're doing.
[02:19:41.441 --> 02:19:43.002]  We don't have a democracy.
[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:47.253]  It's been stolen right in front of our eyes!
[02:19:47.975 --> 02:19:49.401]  Hey, want more proof?
[02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:54.361]  CNN.
[02:19:54.781 --> 02:19:56.422]  The Cartoon News Network.
[02:19:56.742 --> 02:19:58.064]  Well, you little lemon!
[02:19:58.484 --> 02:20:01.646]  A pair of cojones smaller than a lemon!
[02:20:02.387 --> 02:20:04.208]  Oh, I got Anderson Cooper!
[02:20:04.689 --> 02:20:06.170]  I'm a mommy's boy!
[02:20:06.470 --> 02:20:08.752]  My mommy was Gloria Vanderbilt!
[02:20:09.052 --> 02:20:10.834]  How do you think I got this job?
[02:20:11.294 --> 02:20:12.555]  I'm a little coward!
[02:20:12.875 --> 02:20:17.319]  Oh, yeah, when somebody hit me when I was in the Arab Spring in Egypt, I came home!
[02:20:17.839 --> 02:20:19.221]  How about Jake Tapper?
[02:20:19.261 --> 02:20:20.762]  Yeah, tap this, Tapper!
[02:20:21.302 --> 02:20:23.344]  Yeah, this is from the Cartoon News Network.
[02:20:24.326 --> 02:20:25.066]  March 20th, 2020.
[02:20:25.247 --> 02:20:28.008]  Hey, almost three years ago.
[02:20:28.728 --> 02:20:30.129]  Almost three years ago.
[02:20:30.149 --> 02:20:50.579]  The nation's most populous state is ordering its nearly 40 million residents to stay home to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
[02:20:51.919 --> 02:20:53.060]  Goodbye, Rosie.
[02:20:56.493 --> 02:20:57.534]  I'm about to schoolyard.
[02:20:57.794 --> 02:20:59.716]  They should have closed down Corona New York!
[02:21:00.396 --> 02:21:07.663]  Anyway, 19 people have died and more than 900 tested positive.
[02:21:08.083 --> 02:21:09.504]  You tested positive, did you die of it?
[02:21:10.585 --> 02:21:10.766]  No.
[02:21:12.047 --> 02:21:13.888]  A coronavirus in California, huh?
[02:21:13.908 --> 02:21:15.550]  900 people died.
[02:21:17.679 --> 02:21:21.580]  How many of them were obese and blimped out America?
[02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:24.261]  Oh, did you see the new numbers that came out?
[02:21:25.342 --> 02:21:30.023]  70% of the young Americans can't join the army because they're too fat to fight.
[02:21:30.723 --> 02:21:31.104]  Oh, yeah.
[02:21:31.944 --> 02:21:34.005]  Only 42% are obese.
[02:21:36.325 --> 02:21:37.826]  Who is dying from the virus?
[02:21:38.746 --> 02:21:50.492]   Elderly people, people with 2.6 or 2.3 pre-existing comorbidities, including obesity, Type 2 diabetics and respiratory ailments.
[02:21:51.433 --> 02:21:55.036]  Can't breathe with all that stuff on top of me.
[02:21:55.056 --> 02:21:58.059]  900 out of 40 million, huh?
[02:22:00.615 --> 02:22:03.196]  California Governor Gavin Newsom.
[02:22:03.836 --> 02:22:05.696]  Little gruesome Newsom.
[02:22:06.216 --> 02:22:08.597]  Another arrogant little boy.
[02:22:08.937 --> 02:22:11.757]  My daddy was a lawyer for J.P.
[02:22:11.797 --> 02:22:13.598]  and Getty family.
[02:22:14.278 --> 02:22:16.398]  I'm a little arrogant boy.
[02:22:16.418 --> 02:22:18.259]  A member of the club.
[02:22:18.299 --> 02:22:20.159]  That's all it is everybody.
[02:22:20.179 --> 02:22:21.959]  A criminal club.
[02:22:23.340 --> 02:22:32.816]   California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered Order marks the first statewide mandatory restrictions in the United States to combat the outbreak.
[02:22:33.837 --> 02:22:36.258]  It went into effect midnight Thursday.
[02:22:36.738 --> 02:22:40.500]  I say you should have did it one o'clock in the morning, not midnight!
[02:22:42.561 --> 02:22:45.282]  Meaning Californians should not leave their home.
[02:22:49.785 --> 02:22:54.547]  Except for essential things as food, prescriptions, healthcare.
[02:22:56.846 --> 02:22:59.687]  The restrictions will remain in place until further notice.
[02:23:00.027 --> 02:23:02.048]  Did I tell you what to do?
[02:23:02.569 --> 02:23:13.754]  I'm Gavin Newsom, a little arrogant boy who locked down everybody while I went to the French Laundry and partied with my friends.
[02:23:14.634 --> 02:23:16.035]  And what does it cost over there?
[02:23:16.655 --> 02:23:20.297]  Eh, a couple of hundred bucks a dinner, like 400 a person.
[02:23:20.817 --> 02:23:21.097]  Yeah.
[02:23:23.038 --> 02:23:25.579]  This is a moment where we need some straight talk.
[02:23:28.737 --> 02:23:34.161]  We are confident that the people of the state of California will abide and do the right things.
[02:23:36.283 --> 02:23:40.706]  Non-essential services such as dining restaurants.
[02:23:41.126 --> 02:23:42.447]  Go out of business!
[02:23:42.848 --> 02:23:44.509]  Close down your business!
[02:23:47.171 --> 02:23:50.053]  Gyms, convention centers will be shut down.
[02:23:50.073 --> 02:23:50.133]  Huh.
[02:23:54.136 --> 02:23:54.877]  California.
[02:23:56.360 --> 02:24:00.163]  And everybody swallowed the Gavin Newsom crap.
[02:24:00.203 --> 02:24:01.084]  Not everybody.
[02:24:01.484 --> 02:24:02.405]  The majority.
[02:24:03.646 --> 02:24:03.926]  So.
[02:24:06.308 --> 02:24:06.509]  Huh.
[02:24:07.730 --> 02:24:08.490]  California.
[02:24:10.652 --> 02:24:14.395]  How many people died from the coronavirus out of a country of 40 million?
[02:24:14.215 --> 02:24:22.114]   And then the next one. The next one.
[02:24:22.114 --> 02:24:24.114]  And then the next one.
[02:24:24.114 --> 02:24:26.114]  And then the next one.
[02:24:26.114 --> 02:24:28.114]  And then the next one.
[02:24:27.245 --> 02:24:35.712]  Which equals 99.75% of the people didn't die.
[02:24:35.732 --> 02:24:36.772]  99.75% of the people didn't die.
[02:24:36.832 --> 02:24:38.454]  And you're locking up the joint?
[02:24:38.273 --> 02:24:40.632]  didn't die.
[02:24:40.632 --> 02:24:49.413]   99.75% of the people didn't die, and you're locking up the joint?
[02:24:49.413 --> 02:24:51.314]  And who follows?
[02:24:51.314 --> 02:24:56.073]   Cuomo orders non-essential New York workers to stay home.
[02:24:56.466 --> 02:24:58.167]  How Cuomo?
[02:24:58.187 --> 02:25:03.070]  We're changing the name of the Tappan Zee Bridge and naming it after my daddy.
[02:25:03.290 --> 02:25:05.311]  We're naming it after my daddy.
[02:25:06.772 --> 02:25:08.373]  One big club and you ain't in it.
[02:25:08.433 --> 02:25:10.074]  Look at his arrogant little brother.
[02:25:10.314 --> 02:25:12.976]  The little clown, the Cartoon News Network clown.
[02:25:13.216 --> 02:25:13.896]  You got it?
[02:25:14.516 --> 02:25:16.137]  It's not a democracy.
[02:25:16.738 --> 02:25:18.879]  It's a crime syndicate.
[02:25:19.614 --> 02:25:23.858]  With little arrogant boys and girls telling us what to do.
[02:25:24.978 --> 02:25:27.160]  And that's why you need to support InfoWars.
[02:25:28.121 --> 02:25:32.885]  They're giving you the truth, the facts, the hard data, as we do with the Trends Journal.

[02:25:45.455 --> 02:25:46.276]  Yeah, I'm yelling.
[02:25:47.239 --> 02:25:48.699]  No, not Janet yelling.
[02:25:48.999 --> 02:25:50.020]  Yeah, Janet yelling.
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:51.760]  Oh yeah, that's another one.
[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:51.980]  Ms.
[02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:53.120]  Fatsia Brut.
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:54.201]  Fatsia Brut.
[02:25:55.581 --> 02:25:56.341]  Dumb and ugly.
[02:25:57.361 --> 02:25:57.561]  Yep.
[02:25:58.622 --> 02:26:03.203]  That's the Italian expression for people like, uh, a little clown.
[02:26:05.083 --> 02:26:07.724]  As I said, it's one big club and you ain't in it.
[02:26:08.184 --> 02:26:09.124]  I just mentioned Ms.
[02:26:09.144 --> 02:26:10.465]  Fatsia Brut over there.
[02:26:10.825 --> 02:26:12.725]  We're the same age, moron to me.
[02:26:13.025 --> 02:26:14.706]  If I look like you, whoop!
[02:26:15.146 --> 02:26:16.546]  Rather be gone, Jack.
[02:26:17.938 --> 02:26:23.280]  This is the clown lady that was the head of the Federal Reserve.
[02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:24.560]  All right?
[02:26:25.700 --> 02:26:30.042]  If you got a brain bigger than a pea, you figured this one out.
[02:26:30.562 --> 02:26:36.684]  You mean the former head of the Federal Reserve is now our Treasury Secretary?
[02:26:37.164 --> 02:26:38.985]  Yeah, that's right, Salenti!
[02:26:39.965 --> 02:26:41.365]  We're the banksters!
[02:26:42.086 --> 02:26:43.586]  We're in charge!
[02:26:43.986 --> 02:26:46.307]  You are just a piece of scum!
[02:26:47.256 --> 02:26:49.378]  Give me your money, put it in the bank.
[02:26:49.738 --> 02:26:55.482]  We'll give you nothing for it, but boy, we'll loan it back to you for nice high interest rates.
[02:26:57.304 --> 02:26:58.945]  Why would you keep money in the bank?
[02:27:00.126 --> 02:27:02.047]  Why would you keep money in the bank?
[02:27:04.209 --> 02:27:23.188]   Anyway, talking about the clowns and the one big club and the bankster bandits, This is the cover of your Trends Journal back in 2012.
[02:27:23.288 --> 02:27:29.050]  The Prince of Peace becoming violent.
[02:27:31.131 --> 02:27:32.051]  Making a whip.
[02:27:32.431 --> 02:27:34.812]  Yeah, you couldn't buy them at Walmart's back then.
[02:27:34.832 --> 02:27:35.952]  You had to make your own.
[02:27:37.093 --> 02:27:40.574]  And driving the money changers out of the temple.
[02:27:42.254 --> 02:27:44.095]  And who are the money changers he's driving out?
[02:27:45.470 --> 02:27:55.538]  Oh, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Little Jamie Dimon, I'm Jamie Dimon, I got 35 million dollars a year, the big bank we got bailed out by the feds.
[02:27:56.219 --> 02:27:56.499]  Yeah.
[02:27:58.420 --> 02:27:58.981]  Citigroup.
[02:27:59.521 --> 02:27:59.721]  Yep.
[02:28:00.622 --> 02:28:01.082]  There it is.
[02:28:02.644 --> 02:28:04.165]  Nothing has changed.
[02:28:05.646 --> 02:28:07.427]  Oh, and then three days later?
[02:28:09.169 --> 02:28:12.171]  You think you're going to drive the money changers out of the temple?
[02:28:12.932 --> 02:28:14.413]  You're on the cross, man.
[02:28:15.575 --> 02:28:16.236]  Bye bye.
[02:28:16.916 --> 02:28:18.157]  Oh, Easter's coming up.
[02:28:19.458 --> 02:28:20.819]  Yeah, that time of year.
[02:28:20.839 --> 02:28:24.562]  Not a great Friday, but it was a good Friday.
[02:28:24.582 --> 02:28:28.284]  These are the people that are in charge.
[02:28:29.085 --> 02:28:30.386]  It's a crime syndicate.
[02:28:31.781 --> 02:28:34.944]  That imbeciles call a da-mocracy.
[02:28:35.365 --> 02:28:36.766]  You're spelling it wrong.
[02:28:37.106 --> 02:28:42.732]  It's D-U-H, duh, M-O-C-K-R-A-C-Y.
[02:28:43.172 --> 02:28:45.574]  Da-moc-racy.
[02:28:47.576 --> 02:28:48.517]  It's a mockery.
[02:28:48.898 --> 02:28:49.919]  It's a mock-racy.
[02:28:51.901 --> 02:28:53.202]  They're mocking freedom.
[02:28:55.302 --> 02:28:59.685]  I was talking about that arrogant little boy, Andrew Cuomo!
[02:28:59.884 --> 02:29:02.203]  My daddy's Mario!
[02:29:02.203 --> 02:29:08.204]  He goes on...
[02:29:08.204 --> 02:29:18.204]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:29:10.692 --> 02:29:11.773]  Wherever is it here?
[02:29:15.795 --> 02:29:19.898]  Cuomo orders all non-essential New York workers to stay home!
[02:29:20.778 --> 02:29:28.294]   This is the day after the arrogant clown boy over there in California locked down everything.
[02:29:31.117 --> 02:29:34.300]  All workers and non-essential businesses across New York State.
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:37.002]  Look at that arrogant little boy!
[02:29:37.542 --> 02:29:40.405]  Look at that arrogant little boy!
[02:29:41.125 --> 02:29:41.486]  Who?
[02:29:44.788 --> 02:29:50.053]  Issued an executive order to take effect Sunday evening.
[02:29:50.774 --> 02:29:52.215]  Executive order.
[02:29:52.955 --> 02:29:59.862]  That's the kind of crap words they use to obey these little arrogant boys.
[02:29:59.882 --> 02:30:03.365]  Hey, what happened to freedom?
[02:30:04.867 --> 02:30:08.490]  You don't tell me to get a jab, jerk!
[02:30:09.712 --> 02:30:11.473]  Come over here, Andy!
[02:30:11.974 --> 02:30:13.696]  Try to give me a shot!
[02:30:14.326 --> 02:30:14.846]  Yeah!
[02:30:15.387 --> 02:30:19.169]  You try to give me a shot, I'll give you a shot!
[02:30:19.769 --> 02:30:20.870]  Right in your eyes!
[02:30:21.270 --> 02:30:23.712]  I'll push that nose through your brain!
[02:30:24.112 --> 02:30:26.614]  I'll rip out your carotid artery!
[02:30:27.094 --> 02:30:32.698]  If you try to inject me, if you don't do anything, I will be peaceful.
[02:30:33.258 --> 02:30:39.902]  But I won't take orders from a piece of scum, garbage, crap like you!
[02:30:40.162 --> 02:30:42.484]  Hey, you feel up any chicks lately?
[02:30:44.065 --> 02:30:46.048]  Hey, I'm the executive order!
[02:30:46.448 --> 02:30:49.171]  I'll fill you up with an executive order!
[02:30:49.191 --> 02:30:49.252]  Yep!
[02:30:51.574 --> 02:30:51.835]  Hey!
[02:30:53.857 --> 02:30:54.859]  I let go of you, huh?
[02:30:55.039 --> 02:30:56.461]  Would you fill up too many?
[02:30:58.803 --> 02:31:01.387]  Look at the clowns we got running our lives!
[02:31:03.431 --> 02:31:11.137]  Civil fines and mandatory closures for businesses that don't comply with the new mandate will be enforced!
[02:31:11.657 --> 02:31:13.119]  Hail Cuomo!
[02:31:13.499 --> 02:31:14.620]  Hail Gavin!
[02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:16.521]  I'm Witless Whitney!
[02:31:16.861 --> 02:31:19.544]  I'm Little Andy DeWine over there in Ohio!
[02:31:19.864 --> 02:31:25.468]  I'm a little- Hey, all you people in East Palestine dying of poisoning, that's okay!
[02:31:27.930 --> 02:31:29.671]  I'm a little political freak!
[02:31:31.993 --> 02:31:32.934]  One after another!
[02:31:34.975 --> 02:31:35.976]  One after another!
[02:31:39.117 --> 02:31:42.258]  The Governor and Country are participating in social distancing.
[02:31:42.278 --> 02:31:46.640]  In grocery stores, yeah.
[02:31:48.101 --> 02:31:50.122]  So, remember the little circles they drew?
[02:31:51.286 --> 02:31:52.827]  Yeah, look at that little DeWine.
[02:31:53.367 --> 02:31:55.408]  Look at that little jerk!
[02:31:56.048 --> 02:31:59.970]  Look at that arrogant little stupid piece of scum!
[02:32:00.431 --> 02:32:03.692]  Hey, all you people in East Palestine love him, don't you, huh?
[02:32:04.072 --> 02:32:11.216]  As they poison you and all around with birdie-nosed toxic chemicals.
[02:32:11.876 --> 02:32:11.936]  Hey!
[02:32:13.057 --> 02:32:13.177]  Hey!
[02:32:13.677 --> 02:32:15.258]  Shut the hell up, Solenti!
[02:32:16.067 --> 02:32:20.330]  We're the big private equity groups that own all those railroads.
[02:32:20.870 --> 02:32:25.093]  We tell the politicians what to do and they follow our orders.
[02:32:25.493 --> 02:32:30.476]  These are little scum that never worked a day in their life and you can buy them off cheaply.
[02:32:30.876 --> 02:32:33.678]  Look at that arrogant piece of scum!
[02:32:33.698 --> 02:32:38.961]  And I'll call it to your face, you little piece of crap!
[02:32:40.422 --> 02:32:40.582]  Yep.
[02:32:42.225 --> 02:32:47.070]  My governor is an idiot like everywhere else in America.
[02:32:47.511 --> 02:32:50.093]  A-N-E-R-I-K-A.
[02:32:51.715 --> 02:32:54.798]  Hey, how about that little Clown Murphy over here in Joy-Z?
[02:32:55.259 --> 02:32:56.340]  Oh, yeah, the little Joy-Z.
[02:32:56.500 --> 02:32:57.922]  Oh, wait a minute, Senator.
[02:32:58.562 --> 02:33:00.645]  I was with the Big Banks, the bandits.
[02:33:01.806 --> 02:33:03.668]  Of course, I have this job.
[02:33:07.256 --> 02:33:10.658]  I belong to the Criminal Bank Crime Syndicate!
[02:33:11.218 --> 02:33:12.639]  Look at that little nothing!
[02:33:12.979 --> 02:33:14.319]  Locking down everything!
[02:33:14.760 --> 02:33:23.984]  Oh, and little boys and girls, now in Jersey, if you're seven years old, you can decide whether you're a boy or a girl!
[02:33:26.365 --> 02:33:27.686]  They got it right, man.
[02:33:28.266 --> 02:33:30.827]  No democracy in America.
[02:33:32.028 --> 02:33:33.909]  It's the Slave-land-ia!
[02:33:34.716 --> 02:33:37.277]  The plantation of slavelandia!
[02:33:39.057 --> 02:33:41.298]  Run by these little clowns!
[02:33:41.798 --> 02:33:44.219]  Little boys and girls of nothing!
[02:33:47.159 --> 02:33:59.843]  Stand six feet apart, the wind blows exactly in straight lines six feet apart, and when you're in an airplane, you put that mask on when you're not eating and drinking because the virus knows when you're not eating and drinking.
[02:34:00.894 --> 02:34:02.515]  Those are the clowns running the show.
[02:34:02.535 --> 02:34:04.036]  We're going to take a break.
[02:34:04.056 --> 02:34:05.097]  We're going to be right back.
[02:34:05.718 --> 02:34:08.900]  Support InfoWars, InfoWarsStores.com.
[02:34:09.601 --> 02:34:11.582]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:11.622 --> 02:34:23.091]  You know, again, I wasn't going to talk about this, but I saw that piece that they did about the fraud of the COVID lockdowns and all the lies that they were telling.
[02:34:23.766 --> 02:34:25.306]  And that's why I'm going on with this.
[02:34:25.346 --> 02:34:31.788]  You know, we were the first magazine, by the way, we were the first out there calling this whole thing a scam.
[02:34:32.608 --> 02:34:40.350]  You go back to our January 28th, 2020, Trends Journal Magazine cover.
[02:34:41.430 --> 02:34:43.771]  The headline read, Coronavirus.
[02:34:43.791 --> 02:34:45.872]  106 dead in China.
[02:34:49.665 --> 02:34:53.546]  The next line was 1.4 billion still alive.
[02:34:53.566 --> 02:34:55.007]  You know, what are you telling me this for?
[02:34:57.648 --> 02:35:05.410]  Oh, China, they launched it on their Chinese Lunar New Year in January 2020, the year of the rat.
[02:35:06.411 --> 02:35:10.772]  And they did this to lock down what was going on in Hong Kong.
[02:35:10.832 --> 02:35:12.153]  We wrote about this in detail.
[02:35:12.213 --> 02:35:14.193]  I used to be on Hong Kong TV frequently.
[02:35:15.054 --> 02:35:16.514]  And not like the 20 minutes.
[02:35:16.574 --> 02:35:17.074]  There you go.
[02:35:17.134 --> 02:35:17.775]  There's the cover.
[02:35:18.235 --> 02:35:18.815]  Thanks, guys.
[02:35:18.855 --> 02:35:18.955]  Yeah.
[02:35:22.501 --> 02:35:25.582]  Again, and I say the guys, you know, they had these protests.
[02:35:25.622 --> 02:35:26.622]  Now, think about this.
[02:35:27.243 --> 02:35:33.265]  You have Hong Kong with 7.5 million people.
[02:35:33.285 --> 02:35:33.585]  7.5 million.
[02:35:35.645 --> 02:35:44.968]  Over a million were taking to the streets in protests of the Chinese government stealing the freedom from the people of Hong Kong.
[02:35:46.189 --> 02:35:46.949]  They couldn't stop it.
[02:35:48.169 --> 02:35:49.490]  But then they launched COVID.
[02:35:50.558 --> 02:35:51.818]  Everybody locked down!
[02:35:52.378 --> 02:35:53.659]  Everybody locked down!
[02:35:53.819 --> 02:35:54.519]  Stay at home!
[02:35:54.919 --> 02:35:56.359]  We're passing a security law.
[02:35:56.679 --> 02:35:56.920]  Boop!
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:35:57.580]  Ended it.
[02:35:58.260 --> 02:35:58.820]  Finito.
[02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:11.763]  And by the way, one of our top trends for 2020, and we do those in December of 2019, or January, we do them out a month before, was New World Disorder.
[02:36:11.803 --> 02:36:12.843]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:36:13.143 --> 02:36:13.884]  They couldn't stop it.
[02:36:15.724 --> 02:36:17.424]  They couldn't stop it, but they stopped it.
[02:36:18.525 --> 02:36:19.325]  They stopped it.
[02:36:19.525 --> 02:36:19.945]  All done.
[02:36:21.437 --> 02:36:23.799]  So the New World Disorder was going on everywhere.
[02:36:23.819 --> 02:36:25.300]  It was going on in Lebanon.
[02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:27.041]  It was going on in Algeria.
[02:36:27.442 --> 02:36:29.503]  The yellow vests in France.
[02:36:30.604 --> 02:36:34.467]  People taking to the streets in Peru, Bolivia, Colombia.
[02:36:35.368 --> 02:36:35.988]  All over the world.
[02:36:36.869 --> 02:36:37.169]  Back in 2019.
[02:36:37.649 --> 02:36:40.952]  A lack of basic living standards.
[02:36:42.093 --> 02:36:43.854]  Government corruption, crime and violence.
[02:36:43.874 --> 02:36:46.156]  They launched a COVID war.
[02:36:46.616 --> 02:36:47.537]  Get in your house!
[02:36:48.237 --> 02:36:49.198]  No protests!
[02:36:49.418 --> 02:36:50.179]  And they stopped it.
[02:36:51.929 --> 02:36:56.792]  But again, think of it, over a million people taking to the streets out of 7.5 million.
[02:36:57.793 --> 02:37:02.495]  And when we had the Rage Against the War Machine rally in Washington, D.C.
[02:37:04.917 --> 02:37:17.804]  on February 19th, brought to you by the Libertarian Party and the People's Party, Jimmy Dore, myself, Ron Paul, Tulsi Gabbard, Dennis Kucinich, Jill Stein, top people.
[02:37:19.165 --> 02:37:19.986]  About 4,000 people showed up.
[02:37:23.237 --> 02:37:24.518]  There's no fight in this country.
[02:37:25.198 --> 02:37:29.199]  Look what's going on in Israel week after week, day after day, month after month.
[02:37:30.020 --> 02:37:34.341]  People taking to the streets in opposition to the new judicial reform laws.
[02:37:36.402 --> 02:37:37.082]  Not in America.
[02:37:37.102 --> 02:37:40.764]  Look what's going on over there in France.
[02:37:44.565 --> 02:37:47.667]  They're raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 years of age.
[02:37:52.296 --> 02:37:54.417]  And millions of people taking to the streets.
[02:37:56.998 --> 02:37:59.478]  In protest, that little Katson Macron.
[02:38:00.239 --> 02:38:02.679]  A little boy, a little Rothschild's boy.
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.400]  Maybe he's a girl dressed up like a boy.
[02:38:09.142 --> 02:38:12.723]  Telling Parliament to screw you, I'll tell you what to do.
[02:38:13.263 --> 02:38:13.963]  And passing it.
[02:38:14.863 --> 02:38:16.904]  But you don't see these protests in America.
[02:38:17.904 --> 02:38:19.345]  And peace is a dirty word.
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:34.147]  So anyway, going back to the, that we don't have a democracy anymore, and all these countries that pretend to be democracies slaughter their people for freedom when they fight for it.
[02:38:36.769 --> 02:38:46.276]   Cuomo went on to say, this is two days later, It is insensitive, arrogant, and self-destructive.
[02:38:46.516 --> 02:38:52.259]  Cuomo slams ignorance of social distancing calls in New York City.
[02:38:53.420 --> 02:39:00.063]  During a Sunday morning press conference, Cuomo showed a photo of New Yorkers gathering in large groups in city parks.
[02:39:02.324 --> 02:39:06.266]  In contradiction to repeated calls for social distancing!
[02:39:06.286 --> 02:39:07.927]  Hey!
[02:39:09.348 --> 02:39:10.849]  Hey, little arrogant boy!
[02:39:12.853 --> 02:39:21.659]  Your chances of getting COVID outside, according to the data, is less than 1 in 10,000.
[02:39:23.801 --> 02:39:24.301]  If that.
[02:39:29.004 --> 02:39:31.926]  They have destroyed our lives in so many ways.
[02:39:32.006 --> 02:39:38.150]  I'm telling you, this COVID damage, and I'm going to get to the economy on the COVID damage when we come back.
[02:39:38.170 --> 02:39:40.432]  After I'm going to take, when we take the break in a bit.
[02:39:41.041 --> 02:39:42.702]  But I want to go on with this.
[02:39:44.103 --> 02:39:55.352]  The city has already banned team sports, revoked all permits for gatherings, has increased the presence of the New York Police Department and Park Enforcement Patrol officers.
[02:39:55.932 --> 02:39:57.353]  HALLELUJAH!
[02:39:58.794 --> 02:40:02.517]  To enforce social distancing?
[02:40:03.658 --> 02:40:06.020]  Crap that we are making up?
[02:40:07.225 --> 02:40:10.767]  That lacks a scintilla of scientific evidence?
[02:40:11.507 --> 02:40:14.789]  But is only based on political science?
[02:40:15.389 --> 02:40:19.892]  And we are the scum politicians to tell you what to do?
[02:40:19.912 --> 02:40:22.573]  Look at it!
[02:40:24.874 --> 02:40:25.254]  Look at it!
[02:40:26.955 --> 02:40:30.277]  Hey, how about all those kids playing instruments in little tents?
[02:40:34.659 --> 02:40:35.480]  Oh, here's another one.
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:36.140]  Again, again, I...
[02:40:38.948 --> 02:40:43.231]  Police in Ocean City County, New Jersey... Hey, what exit?
[02:40:43.831 --> 02:40:52.577]  ...have arrested a homeowner for hosting a pop-up wedding during the COVID-19 pandemic.
[02:40:54.819 --> 02:41:03.865]  New Jersey governor, arrogant little gutless clown, slime boy, piece of bagster crap!
[02:41:05.746 --> 02:41:06.807]  Phil Murphy!
[02:41:07.527 --> 02:41:08.588]  Phil Murphy!
[02:41:09.594 --> 02:41:14.159]  Ban gatherings of 50 or more people.
[02:41:14.179 --> 02:41:20.045]  Hey, I say you should have banned it for 51 people.
[02:41:20.565 --> 02:41:21.847]  No, let's make it 47.
[02:41:22.307 --> 02:41:23.809]  No, how about 38?
[02:41:24.590 --> 02:41:25.731]  How about 69?
[02:41:26.311 --> 02:41:28.333]  Yeah, now we're talking.
[02:41:29.435 --> 02:41:29.675]  Yeah.
[02:41:32.976 --> 02:41:39.621]  On Friday, Murphy said he expects to issue MORE RESTRICTIONS!
[02:41:40.522 --> 02:41:42.463]  I AM YOUR GOVERNOR!
[02:41:43.084 --> 02:41:45.405]  I WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO!
[02:41:45.425 --> 02:41:49.188]  I STEAL YOUR MONEY IN THE NAME OF TAXES!
[02:41:49.789 --> 02:41:51.770]  I GIVE IT TO MY FRIENDS!
[02:41:52.631 --> 02:41:56.313]  I SCREW YOU IN EVERY WAY YOU HATE TO BE SCREWED!
[02:41:57.094 --> 02:41:58.695]  I'M LITTLE MURPHY!
[02:41:58.514 --> 02:41:59.514]  Yep.
[02:41:59.514 --> 02:42:06.635]  Those are the numbers.
[02:42:07.023 --> 02:42:09.584]  Those are the clowns telling you what to do.
[02:42:10.104 --> 02:42:16.787]  How could any man or woman take orders from a little piece of scum crap like him?
[02:42:16.807 --> 02:42:24.451]  Andy Cuomo, Governor Newsom, little... DeWine, DeWine over there, DeWine.
[02:42:24.471 --> 02:42:26.752]  Oh, Willis Whitmer.
[02:42:26.772 --> 02:42:30.094]  Oh, and they voted him back into office, yeah.
[02:42:31.286 --> 02:42:32.927]  We're Americans!
[02:42:33.807 --> 02:42:36.608]  We are the majority of morons!
[02:42:36.628 --> 02:42:42.170]  Look, we're gonna take a break.
[02:42:42.190 --> 02:42:44.411]  We're gonna be back in a little bit and I'm gonna talk about the economy.
[02:42:44.431 --> 02:42:45.531]  I gotta get off this stuff.
[02:42:46.291 --> 02:42:47.792]  I'm telling you, they've destroyed life.
[02:42:48.959 --> 02:42:50.300]  In so many different ways.
[02:42:51.902 --> 02:42:55.085]  It's beyond the belief of what this COVID war has done.
[02:42:55.145 --> 02:42:56.906]  And again, we warned about this.
[02:42:57.507 --> 02:43:04.213]  And one of the things we warned about that no one's warned about other than us up until now is office building bust.
[02:43:04.934 --> 02:43:07.936]  Oh, you think the Silicon Valley bank bust was bad?
[02:43:08.517 --> 02:43:10.479]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:43:11.199 --> 02:43:11.820]  Nothing yet.
[02:43:11.940 --> 02:43:19.894]   Oh, and by the way, Death of the dollar, ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing, bye-bye bucks, coming soon.
[02:43:21.375 --> 02:43:24.397]  Remember, support InfoWars, do everything you can.
[02:43:24.878 --> 02:43:26.519]  We get back, we're going to talk about more.
[02:43:27.780 --> 02:43:32.003]  You know, we're going to be talking a lot about the economy and what to expect.
[02:43:32.903 --> 02:43:38.347]  We are headed into the worst geopolitical and socioeconomic crisis in modern history.
[02:43:39.605 --> 02:43:41.886]  Again, with the COVID war, all things are connected.
[02:43:42.486 --> 02:43:49.829]  Trillions of dollars that they dumped into it to, you know, stay home, don't go to work, his free money and giving it to businesses, etc.
[02:43:50.389 --> 02:43:51.830]  Zero interest rate policy.
[02:43:51.850 --> 02:43:54.611]  I mean, this is all, all things are connected.
[02:43:55.311 --> 02:43:58.853]  And so what I'm saying to you, the worst is yet to come.
[02:43:59.393 --> 02:44:03.635]  And it's going to be the worst financial and geopolitical crisis in modern history.
[02:44:03.675 --> 02:44:11.004]   So what you want to do Or what I want to do, and the motto of the Trends Journal magazine is think for yourself.
[02:44:11.604 --> 02:44:13.045]  You want to prepare for the worst.
[02:44:13.985 --> 02:44:18.167]  And one of the ways, again, you prepare for the worst, the worst doesn't happen, you don't lose anything.
[02:44:18.888 --> 02:44:22.389]  If you don't prepare for the worst and the worst happens, you could lose everything.
[02:44:23.230 --> 02:44:33.335]  And so what they have now at InfoWars for you to consider doing, is which I'm a big supporter of, and they have these very high quality storable foods.
[02:44:34.941 --> 02:44:35.341]  Water.
[02:44:36.361 --> 02:44:37.182]  Air supplies.
[02:44:38.042 --> 02:44:42.763]  And this stuff was out of stock because the demand is so high, but it's back in stock now.
[02:44:43.244 --> 02:44:46.525]  And you can find it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:46.565 --> 02:44:47.945]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:48.865 --> 02:44:59.028]  And again, you know, these air filtration systems, the storable food, they have the Alexa Pure ProWater filtration system, the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:44:59.849 --> 02:45:01.069]  One year food supply.
[02:45:01.569 --> 02:45:04.590]  Six months, three months, four weeks, whatever you want.
[02:45:05.698 --> 02:45:13.944]  And it's essential because, again, you know, the worst is yet to come and you want to be prepared for the worst.
[02:45:14.484 --> 02:45:21.369]  And you can stock up long term or short term, whatever your decision is, with these various sizes of storable food options.
[02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:28.113]  And, you know, I'm a big believer in pure water and the Alexa Pure pro water system.
[02:45:28.574 --> 02:45:42.169]   You know, you don't have to worry about having clean water and all those Those forever chemicals we wrote in the Trends Journal just in this edition of all the forever chemicals in the water and all the other poisons.
[02:45:42.269 --> 02:45:44.850]  So this is stuff that's going to help keep you healthy.
[02:45:45.790 --> 02:45:51.032]  And again, the Trends Journal, by the way, it's the grand total of $2.86 a week.
[02:45:51.832 --> 02:45:54.813]  Last week was about 165 pages.
[02:45:55.033 --> 02:45:55.733]  No ads.
[02:45:56.233 --> 02:45:57.514]  Nobody tells us what to do.
[02:45:58.274 --> 02:46:01.495]  And we're giving you everything like InfoWars is giving you everything.
[02:46:02.173 --> 02:46:06.675]  To prepare, prevail, and prosper in these times ahead, because we're running into tough times.
[02:46:07.255 --> 02:46:10.857]  Before I get into the economy, I want to put these numbers together.
[02:46:10.877 --> 02:46:14.458]  I was talking about the arrogance, and this isn't a democracy.
[02:46:14.478 --> 02:46:16.739]  I got another arrogant little boy.
[02:46:16.759 --> 02:46:17.900]  I'm the judge.
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:19.060]  Here comes the judge.
[02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:20.021]  Here comes the judge.
[02:46:20.681 --> 02:46:24.302]  This is from, again, the COVID war begins in January 2020.
[02:46:24.402 --> 02:46:26.803]  This is August 24th, 2021, from the New York Times.
[02:46:31.539 --> 02:46:34.641]  Two judges tell defendants to be vaccinated.
[02:46:37.143 --> 02:46:37.343]  Here.
[02:46:38.484 --> 02:46:39.304]  Not making this up.
[02:46:43.387 --> 02:46:46.349]  The defendant was charged with a number of minor crimes.
[02:46:46.369 --> 02:46:47.730]  The guy didn't do much of anything.
[02:46:48.831 --> 02:46:50.052]  Including drug possession.
[02:46:50.072 --> 02:46:50.292]  Why?
[02:46:50.372 --> 02:46:51.093]  How dare you?
[02:46:51.453 --> 02:46:57.077]  How dare you possess drugs that the drug dealers don't sell, man?
[02:46:59.699 --> 02:47:00.079]  Anyway.
[02:47:02.245 --> 02:47:02.965]  And shoplifting.
[02:47:03.666 --> 02:47:08.328]  He was prepared to plead guilty, and prosecutors agreed.
[02:47:09.449 --> 02:47:17.033]  But the Bronx judge approved, approving the deal, added his own condition.
[02:47:20.375 --> 02:47:24.978]  The defendant had to get a COVID-19 vaccination.
[02:47:26.499 --> 02:47:26.839]  Oh yeah?
[02:47:31.764 --> 02:47:40.249]  A week later, a Manhattan judge made the same order this time of a woman seeking bail before a trial.
[02:47:45.231 --> 02:47:45.692]  Hitler?
[02:47:48.293 --> 02:47:49.834]  Judge Rakoff?
[02:47:51.535 --> 02:47:56.118]  How about putting jerk before the rack?
[02:48:00.180 --> 02:48:00.540]  Argued?
[02:48:01.479 --> 02:48:12.425]  That it fell to him to determine whether a person seeking release represented a danger to the community.
[02:48:12.445 --> 02:48:29.573]  Quote, the unvaccinated did pose such a risk to danger, giving their enhanced risk of infection, of infecting others, innocent people, and even potentially causing their death.
[02:48:30.374 --> 02:48:30.474]  Oh.
[02:48:31.337 --> 02:48:33.719]  I guess with a name like Rackoff, you must be Jewish.
[02:48:33.759 --> 02:48:36.841]  Again, take that Rackoff and put a jerk in front of it.
[02:48:38.302 --> 02:48:38.602]  Yeah.
[02:48:40.624 --> 02:48:43.826]  You would have been great in Germany during Hitler's time.
[02:48:44.787 --> 02:48:48.590]  Oh yeah, forcing people to do whatever you want them to do.
[02:48:49.110 --> 02:48:50.231]  They have no freedom.
[02:48:50.752 --> 02:48:51.792]  You're a rack.
[02:48:51.992 --> 02:48:55.495]  I can't say jerk, but hey, Rackoff.
[02:48:57.517 --> 02:48:58.457]  Could you imagine this?
[02:48:59.518 --> 02:49:00.459]  Could you imagine this?
[02:49:03.391 --> 02:49:06.754]  Anyway, I'm gonna go to the economy now.
[02:49:07.975 --> 02:49:08.736]  Very serious.
[02:49:09.296 --> 02:49:10.437]  Very, very serious.
[02:49:12.459 --> 02:49:21.346]  We warned of a office building bust back when they locked down everything and people weren't going back to work.
[02:49:23.908 --> 02:49:27.371]  The off-socket to see rate in the United States is around 50.5%.
[02:49:29.913 --> 02:49:32.075]  You think that SVB bank went bust?
[02:49:33.143 --> 02:49:34.784]  And again, we detail the whys.
[02:49:36.385 --> 02:49:43.550]  Because a locked down society, the big tech, what big tech?
[02:49:44.090 --> 02:49:46.292]  Little creepy little geeks of nothing.
[02:49:47.052 --> 02:49:48.674]  And they told everybody to stay home.
[02:49:48.714 --> 02:49:50.715]  Their stocks, boom, there's everybody Zoomed.
[02:49:51.055 --> 02:49:52.096]  They closed down the schools.
[02:49:52.116 --> 02:49:53.157]  You're learning online.
[02:49:53.517 --> 02:49:55.858]  People are buying online, shopping online.
[02:49:57.259 --> 02:49:59.521]  Not going out to restaurants, buying online.
[02:50:00.470 --> 02:50:03.472]  And then they had all these SPACs and IPOs.
[02:50:03.932 --> 02:50:06.274]  And then when the COVID war ended, the stocks went down.
[02:50:06.294 --> 02:50:09.636]  The Nasdaq was down 33% at the end of last year.
[02:50:10.537 --> 02:50:11.777]  That's why the bank went bust.
[02:50:13.018 --> 02:50:16.521]  But nobody's talking about the commercial office building bust.
[02:50:18.522 --> 02:50:20.023]  You have these revolving loans.
[02:50:20.123 --> 02:50:23.145]  As interest rate goes up, you got to pay more now on your loan when it comes up.
[02:50:24.344 --> 02:50:26.444]  And now you have an office occupancy rate of 50%.
[02:50:27.225 --> 02:50:28.545]  I'm a guy renting offices.
[02:50:28.605 --> 02:50:30.065]  I don't need all these offices anymore.
[02:50:30.445 --> 02:50:30.865]  Stay home.
[02:50:30.905 --> 02:50:31.386]  Work from home.
[02:50:31.426 --> 02:50:31.926]  It's fine.
[02:50:32.926 --> 02:50:34.286]  Come in two or three days a week.
[02:50:35.667 --> 02:50:36.947]  Now I'm the owner of these buildings.
[02:50:36.967 --> 02:50:38.147]  How am I going to pay back my loan?
[02:50:39.107 --> 02:50:39.467]  You're not.
[02:50:40.167 --> 02:50:43.808]  You tell the bank, keep the office building.
[02:50:43.868 --> 02:50:44.909]  It ain't mine anymore.
[02:50:44.929 --> 02:50:45.369]  It's yours.
[02:50:47.669 --> 02:50:51.390]  You are going to see an office building bust, the likes of which you've never seen.
[02:50:53.698 --> 02:50:56.199]  And it's trillions and trillions of dollars.
[02:50:59.039 --> 02:51:00.779]  And it was overbuilt before this.
[02:51:01.840 --> 02:51:04.120]  Again, we only write about the details.
[02:51:05.240 --> 02:51:11.301]  And we were writing back in 2019 about the office building bust.
[02:51:12.462 --> 02:51:14.702]  Excuse me, that it was overbuilt before then.
[02:51:15.582 --> 02:51:17.343]  And this is an important note, by the way.
[02:51:17.622 --> 02:51:19.622]  And this is going back to the COVID war.
[02:51:19.622 --> 02:51:27.141]  They're calling it a pandemic.
[02:51:27.311 --> 02:51:29.751]  If it was a pandemic, how many people you know that died?
[02:51:30.392 --> 02:51:35.573]  Okay, here is the data that no one is saying other than the Trends Journal.
[02:51:36.313 --> 02:51:37.874]  Trendsjournal.com.
[02:51:39.394 --> 02:51:41.435]  America.
[02:51:41.455 --> 02:51:46.016]  332 million people out of the course of three years during the COVID war.
[02:51:45.835 --> 02:51:47.835]  You know how many died?
[02:51:47.835 --> 02:51:49.835]  1,123,000.
[02:51:49.835 --> 02:51:53.835]   Which equals 1,123,000.
[02:51:53.835 --> 02:51:57.835]   Which equals 1,123,000.
[02:51:57.231 --> 02:52:01.013]  Which means that 99.66% of the population is still alive.
[02:52:01.253 --> 02:52:02.874]  Don't you call it a pandemic!
[02:52:02.693 --> 02:52:13.653]   percent, which means that 99.66 percent of the population is still alive.
[02:52:13.653 --> 02:52:15.833]  Don't you call it a pandemic.
[02:52:15.833 --> 02:52:25.893]  It was a political, commie, Nazi overtake of America.
[02:52:25.893 --> 02:52:36.452]   So over the course of three years, that equals 0.112 percent each year.
[02:52:36.206 --> 02:52:45.765]   of the population dying, meaning that 99.88% of the population survived each year.
[02:52:45.765 --> 02:52:52.486]  So there you got it.
[02:52:52.486 --> 02:52:56.924]  So now the IMF is warning of a global economic instability.
[02:52:57.526 --> 02:52:58.326]  Yeah, no kidding.
[02:52:59.727 --> 02:53:01.327]  It's one after another.
[02:53:01.868 --> 02:53:05.350]  This thing is going down big and it's going to go down hard.
[02:53:06.430 --> 02:53:10.372]  The office building bust virtually no one is talking about.
[02:53:11.252 --> 02:53:12.933]  We're writing about it in detail.
[02:53:14.294 --> 02:53:21.218]   The worst is yet to come and the disaster is going to be Beyond what could be imagined.
[02:53:21.638 --> 02:53:22.818]  But don't worry about it.
[02:53:23.319 --> 02:53:26.120]  Because when all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:53:27.741 --> 02:53:33.703]  Biden's popularity rating is back down into the toilet where that crap head should be flushed into.
[02:53:33.723 --> 02:53:42.087]  His ratings went up when he started fighting Russia by supplying more weapons.
[02:53:42.546 --> 02:53:44.865]  So anyway, support InfoWars.
[02:53:44.865 --> 02:53:50.866]  [Music]
[02:53:50.866 --> 02:53:56.866]   When everything is a lie, which it is now, there's only one place to find the truth,
[02:53:56.866 --> 02:54:00.866]   and it's not in government stats or government reports or declarations.
[02:54:00.932 --> 02:54:01.152]  It's, uh...
[02:54:02.671 --> 02:54:38.416]   It's with God and I know you speak about that often and I believe look we need God more more than ever and I know that there are people listening perhaps that don't believe in God but I'm a big believer in having faith even though I'm rather pessimistic I do know how the book ends I know I know how the story ends and we do prevail exactly there are no atheists and foxholes where there's life there's hope when so don't lose out there thinking well you know what's left for me to do.
[02:54:38.416 --> 02:54:42.237]   One of the things and again this is not a shame or this is not a plug but you
[02:54:42.237 --> 02:54:46.836]   know we need to support your Stainful Wars store we need to support yours by the
[02:54:46.836 --> 02:54:52.477]   way my wife loves Samaric 95 her joints have never been better
[02:54:50.828 --> 02:54:54.449]  Okay, so, folks, make sure you support InfoWarStore.
[02:54:54.609 --> 02:54:55.869]  Okay, please do that.
[02:54:55.889 --> 02:55:00.511]  Well, I just can't say to our listeners how much the enemies of freedom hate this show, they hate your show.
[02:55:00.531 --> 02:55:02.392]  I mean, I will plug for you and for me.
[02:55:02.772 --> 02:55:03.812]  Folks, you want us to fight?
[02:55:03.972 --> 02:55:04.712]  We will do it.
[02:55:05.133 --> 02:55:07.993]  But it's like sending military out to war without ammunition and weapons.
[02:55:08.114 --> 02:55:16.497]   I mean, we'll, and I'm not bitching, I just, I just, back in, back in 19, back in like 2016, We had plenty of money.
[02:55:17.057 --> 02:55:18.718]  Our subscription service has said it's free now.
[02:55:19.058 --> 02:55:19.939]  I barely was plugging.
[02:55:20.519 --> 02:55:31.427]  We had all this extra money and now I wish back then I would have pushed harder, saved up money because now with the deplatforming, the attacks, folks, you know, we need support, so do you.
[02:55:32.247 --> 02:55:38.732]  But what we really need is people to share the links and articles to our videos and your videos, your reports, Doug, because the public's ready.
[02:55:38.772 --> 02:55:39.932]  The ground's fertile right now.
[02:55:39.972 --> 02:55:40.693]  The minds are ready.
[02:55:41.193 --> 02:55:46.455]  It's easy to outpace your supply lines and I think that's where a lot of us are.
[02:55:46.475 --> 02:55:50.576]  You know, we're in so deep that we can't.
[02:55:50.956 --> 02:55:52.297]  Look, we need that support.
[02:55:52.477 --> 02:55:53.437]  You need that support.
[02:55:53.457 --> 02:55:58.299]  So again, folks, please support Alex Jones and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
[02:55:58.578 --> 02:56:04.217]   I know there's things that he won't say that, look, he needs your support.
[02:56:04.217 --> 02:56:09.298]   We all need your support, but especially Infowars.com, Infowars store, please do that.
[02:56:09.298 --> 02:56:12.378]  There it is, turmeric toothpaste.
[02:56:12.378 --> 02:56:15.297]  I love that too, my wife does as well.
[02:56:15.297 --> 02:56:16.859]  Big fan of all of your products.
[02:56:16.859 --> 02:56:19.218]  Okay, folks, don't lose hope.
[02:56:19.218 --> 02:56:20.398]  Please don't do that.
[02:56:20.398 --> 02:56:26.859]   I know that things look bleak, but again, we know how the story ends.
[02:56:26.859 --> 02:56:31.818]   And I think, look at everything that happens, not through, not with blinders,
[02:56:31.818 --> 02:56:36.058]  but in the context of a larger agenda.
[02:56:36.058 --> 02:56:41.058]  Think bigger, look bigger, and look for the.
[02:56:40.261 --> 02:56:49.467]  I use the analogy of that great movie that's basically a composite of true stories, Horse 10 from Navarone, where they blow up the dam, it doesn't fall right away, and they all panic.
[02:56:49.807 --> 02:56:53.509]  The explosive expert goes, watch, it's gonna fall, take about 20 minutes, just watch.
[02:56:54.290 --> 02:56:55.871]  We've been through all this and nothing!
[02:56:56.751 --> 02:57:00.994]  Nothing but... You have to let nature take her course.
[02:57:02.710 --> 02:57:04.151]  I think we've already blown the enemy.
[02:57:04.531 --> 02:57:06.212]  We just have to get ready and then stand back.
[02:57:06.532 --> 02:57:07.173]  Amen to that.
[02:57:07.493 --> 02:57:07.913]  Amen.
[02:57:08.013 --> 02:57:09.154]  And you're doing a great job.
[02:57:09.434 --> 02:57:13.096]  And again, I want to thank you so much for allowing me to be part of your program today.
[02:57:13.496 --> 02:57:14.936]  I really appreciate what you do.
[02:57:15.297 --> 02:57:25.642]  Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed that the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?
[02:57:25.982 --> 02:57:31.369]  I totally resent that, and if anybody's lying here, Senator, it is you!
[02:57:31.870 --> 02:57:34.713]  I think there's no doubt that NIH was funding gain-of-function research.
[02:57:35.054 --> 02:57:39.359]  Is it likely that American tax dollars funded the gain-of-function research that created this virus?
[02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:44.546]  I think it did, not only from NIH, but from the State Department, USAID, and from DOD.
