[00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.531]  It's Sunday, October 8th, 2023.
[00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.893]  This is going to be an extremely important transmission.
[00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:11.034]  You're about to get Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:00:11.954 --> 00:00:12.375]  Stay with us.
[00:00:15.076 --> 00:00:15.836]  InfoWars.
[00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:17.996]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:00:17.996 --> 00:00:20.996]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:33.756]  For two years, I've started the show with air raid sirens.
[00:00:32.796 --> 00:00:34.418]  I've been on air 29 years, never did that.
[00:00:34.438 --> 00:00:42.144]  Because I told you, war's coming in Middle East, war's coming in Europe, Eastern Europe, Russia.
[00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:44.306]  War's coming in Asia.
[00:00:45.627 --> 00:00:47.228]  These are the times of World War.
[00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.592]  World War III has already begun.
[00:00:53.993 --> 00:01:03.696]  There are powerful multinational financial forces who are openly funding and manipulating all of this.
[00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:14.059]  They're not in control of all the groups, but they are setting the stage, setting the components, the atmosphere for what you're witnessing.
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:22.498]   Hundreds, probably thousands of dead Israelis, Probably thousands of dead Palestinians.
[00:01:22.978 --> 00:01:25.460]  They say hundreds of dead on each side, thousands wounded.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:38.710]  They're saying hundreds, at least, Israeli captives held hostage, taken back to the Gaza Strip by Hamas.
[00:01:41.072 --> 00:01:51.403]   But as I told you yesterday, as it was unfolding in the emergency Saturday broadcast, Hezbollah is behind it.
[00:01:52.724 --> 00:02:00.531]  And now Hamas said that Iran was the main backer and basically directed the attacks.
[00:02:02.472 --> 00:02:03.393]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:02:04.654 --> 00:02:07.576]  Hamas says attacks on Israel were backed by Iran.
[00:02:07.596 --> 00:02:12.960]  Hamas spokesperson says Iran gave the main support for surprise attack on Israel.
[00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:16.083]  Israel blames Iran for Hamas attack.
[00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.161]  That's the Jerusalem Post, The Atlantic, a message from Iran.
[00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:26.485]  The Israeli-Hamas war, no matter who loses, Iran wins.
[00:02:29.267 --> 00:02:31.408]  Okay, let's not be emotional about this.
[00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.572]  It's terrible to see the men and women and children being slaughtered.
[00:02:36.272 --> 00:02:38.113]  It's terrible to see civilian casualties.
[00:02:38.914 --> 00:02:45.659]  And I unequivocally repudiate what Hamas and Hezbollah have done.
[00:02:49.153 --> 00:02:52.455]  That said, we're not children here.
[00:02:52.536 --> 00:02:54.957]  People don't tune in here to get a bunch of bull.
[00:02:55.998 --> 00:02:57.819]  You tune in to get the real skinning.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.142]  Now, as soon as this happened, I already knew the main players.
[00:03:01.842 --> 00:03:02.663]  When I woke up at 5 a.m.
[00:03:02.723 --> 00:03:10.829]  yesterday and began reporting on this, we're now just a day into this giant, unprecedented, second largest sneak attack on Israel in its 70-plus year history.
[00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:21.167]  But I made a lot of phone calls to people that have worked for the CIA, for the Department of Defense, and others, including some that work in this building.
[00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:30.870]  And they agreed with me, actually asked their opinion, they told me their opinion before I even went on air, that this was Iran mainly behind it.
[00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.770]  And a lot of other key points.
[00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:47.416]   Now there are scores of former Israeli intelligence agency individuals who were in Shin Bet, Mossad, Israeli military intelligence has gone public, saying there's no way Israel had this big an intelligence failure.
[00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:52.617]  Tens of thousands of Hamas, Hezbollah-backed troops going in.
[00:03:52.637 --> 00:03:56.998]  Now more than 7,000 missiles fired in 24 hours.
[00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:03.000]  Armored vehicles, trucks, motorcycles going in, bulldozers.
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.021]  And hours and hours and hours before any main Israeli forces were moved into the area to block it.
[00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:15.025]  When they know the main threat comes out of the Gaza Strip, they knew there was massive movement.
[00:04:15.045 --> 00:04:16.106]  They knew there was huge preparation.
[00:04:16.126 --> 00:04:26.169]  They have spies embedded throughout that area of the Middle East and throughout areas that they don't hold what the Palestinians call occupied Palestine.
[00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:33.731]  So the first big takeaway is you can bet your bottom dollar those in Israeli stand down.
[00:04:35.134 --> 00:04:41.701]  And whereas we're sad for those that were killed, and we repudiate what Hamas has done, it's really disgusting, we're not going to sit here and be idiots.
[00:04:42.862 --> 00:04:48.988]  Israel's leadership stood down and took this attack because now Netanyahu will get his dictatorship.
[00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:50.610]  That's just the facts.
[00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.270]   Now there's a lot of other big pieces we'll break down on the other side.
[00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:05.270]  [MUSIC]
[00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:15.270]  [MUSIC]
[00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:24.270]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.410]   It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:43.050]   Now if people want to be emotional and you want to be shallow and you want to be ill-informed,
[00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.450]  this is not going to be the broadcast for you.
[00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:48.582]  It is Sunday, October 8th, 2023.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.742]  We are live from the Austin, Texas studios.
[00:05:52.762 --> 00:05:54.945]  We're here for four hours broadcasting worldwide tonight.
[00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:56.467]  Hope you share the links.
[00:05:56.887 --> 00:05:58.249]  Everybody you know and those you don't know.
[00:05:58.269 --> 00:06:01.032]  Your email list, text messages, and every other way you can.
[00:06:01.453 --> 00:06:04.296]  That's how we punch through the globalist censorship Berlin Wall.
[00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:05.718]  Electronic Berlin Wall.
[00:06:06.775 --> 00:06:10.077]  Okay, let me just give you the summation up front of what's going on.
[00:06:10.177 --> 00:06:12.318]  For sure, undoubted, absolute fact.
[00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:13.379]  Can't argue with it.
[00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:14.300]  It's overwhelming.
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.161]  And then I'm going to drill through all the evidence.
[00:06:16.801 --> 00:06:17.902]  I tend to go through all the evidence.
[00:06:17.942 --> 00:06:18.662]  That takes hours.
[00:06:18.702 --> 00:06:19.883]  And then give you the answer at the end.
[00:06:20.183 --> 00:06:21.384]  I'm going to tell you what's going on.
[00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:23.725]  I'm sure a lot of you are going to agree with me.
[00:06:23.765 --> 00:06:24.886]  Some of you are not going to agree.
[00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:26.247]  But here's the facts.
[00:06:27.167 --> 00:06:28.008]  Here's the reality.
[00:06:29.261 --> 00:06:32.024]  This is disgusting tribal religious war.
[00:06:32.564 --> 00:06:33.405]  War is horrible.
[00:06:33.886 --> 00:06:37.269]  I repudiate what Hamas, run by Hezbollah, has done.
[00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.473]  And Israel is going to flatten the Gaza Strip.
[00:06:40.873 --> 00:06:43.276]  And Israel is going nowhere with thousands of nuclear weapons.
[00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:51.584]  And our hearts go out, I know mine do, and the crews do, to the men, women, and children that have been killed needlessly, senselessly, and have been taken into captivity.
[00:06:52.352 --> 00:06:58.455]  That said, I don't like some of the indiscriminate bombing that's also been disgusting that we've seen by Israel against the Gaza Strip.
[00:06:58.715 --> 00:07:04.398]  But this is sectarian war going on for 70 plus years and thousands of years ago before that.
[00:07:05.418 --> 00:07:10.761]  The Jews have kicked the Greeks out, the Romans out, everybody else out for 3,000 years from that area.
[00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:12.802]  They've lived in peace many times with the Arabs.
[00:07:12.822 --> 00:07:15.343]  That's good, but that's not what's going on.
[00:07:15.684 --> 00:07:16.884]  That's the historic reality.
[00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:20.246]  Now, let's pull back from this.
[00:07:21.564 --> 00:07:54.541]   Here's the facts, and there are countless Mossad, Shin Bet, Army Intelligence, you name it, individuals, journalists, in their new incarnation, saying there's no way that the Mossad and the Shin Bet, the internal security force of the Israelis, who have literally tens of thousands of spies in the Gaza Strip, there's over two and a half million people, Did not know there was an attack coming now with 7,000 missiles.
[00:07:54.982 --> 00:07:57.085]  Others saying 20,000 men and women.
[00:07:58.887 --> 00:08:01.791]  Trucks, motorcycles, hang gliders.
[00:08:03.474 --> 00:08:08.416]  Light aircraft, drones, being prepared to launch.
[00:08:08.536 --> 00:08:15.139]  I mean, the United States knew months before Russia was building up troops about to go into Ukraine a year and a half ago, and the Pentagon was accurate.
[00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:16.540]  They said, we believe they're about to invade.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:32.567]  I saw the buildup months before in October, three months before, and I said, four months before, and I said, I believe they'll invade by the end of February, because that's when they have a month left before it unfreezes and the tanks can't go through all the mud.
[00:08:34.212 --> 00:08:38.876]  And they invented it on October 24th, 2022.
[00:08:40.918 --> 00:08:42.600]  So it's easy to call all this.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.004]  So here's the bottom line, and it's not about demonizing the Israeli government.
[00:08:47.044 --> 00:08:56.873]  It's not about demonizing Benjamin Netanyahu, though he's very unpopular and is setting up the judicial reform that's very police-statish, just like we see happening here.
[00:08:57.813 --> 00:08:59.236]  But it's just a fact, okay?
[00:08:59.897 --> 00:09:02.823]  And so, you ask, how is he elected the leader of Israel?
[00:09:03.304 --> 00:09:04.466]  Same way Justin Trudeau is.
[00:09:04.887 --> 00:09:07.633]  It's a parliamentary system, so you can get 30% of the vote.
[00:09:09.824 --> 00:09:14.549]  And roughly, depending on the parliamentary setup, and still be the President or Prime Minister.
[00:09:15.209 --> 00:09:16.471]  So that's what's going on.
[00:09:16.571 --> 00:09:23.298]  So yes, this does help Benjamin Netanyahu cement power, expand power, unify the government behind him.
[00:09:23.778 --> 00:09:25.420]  I'm not saying he's behind the attack.
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.342]  I'm not saying he's a villain in this.
[00:09:27.482 --> 00:09:31.526]  I'm saying these are the pieces I'm about to lay out before I give you the bottom line.
[00:09:32.126 --> 00:09:33.528]  And there's no debating this bottom line.
[00:09:34.133 --> 00:09:34.894]  Well, the phone's up.
[00:09:35.254 --> 00:09:36.895]  The second hour, we'll do it tomorrow as well.
[00:09:36.935 --> 00:09:39.957]  But, I mean, anybody that's informed can't really disagree with this.
[00:09:40.397 --> 00:09:46.141]  There was an intelligence, military, police stand-down.
[00:09:46.541 --> 00:09:47.562]  This was not a failure.
[00:09:47.582 --> 00:09:48.823]  9-11 was not a failure.
[00:09:49.283 --> 00:09:53.506]  That was a massive stand-down, and that came out in congressional reports, even though it was a whitewash.
[00:09:53.966 --> 00:09:57.709]  So there's your big piece of the jigsaw puzzle.
[00:09:57.729 --> 00:09:59.150]  Now you add on to it.
[00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.632]  What happened a year and a half ago, almost two years ago?
[00:10:04.179 --> 00:10:12.163]  A snap withdrawal from Afghanistan, disregarding Trump and the Pentagon's plan to phase out over a year.
[00:10:12.883 --> 00:10:21.848]  They pull out in one week, and the Taliban, Al Qaeda, slash ISIS got over $7 billion in modern weapons.
[00:10:22.928 --> 00:10:26.510]  Anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, anti-aircraft batteries.
[00:10:28.091 --> 00:10:31.692]  Millions of M4s, modern M16s.
[00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:39.413]  Millions of other munitions, grenades, mines, I mean, why would you do that?
[00:10:40.433 --> 00:10:41.514]  They could have flown it all out.
[00:10:41.554 --> 00:10:49.957]  You notice the Israelis, we have the videos, I sent them to you, pulling out F-16s out of airbases that are about to be overrun, pulling back their tanks till they get more forces there.
[00:10:50.218 --> 00:10:54.940]  The Israelis didn't hand this over as much as, you know, they could stand.
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.601]  Some stuff got overrun, some stuff got taken.
[00:10:58.961 --> 00:11:16.160]   So we have $7 billion, $7 billion of high-tech equipment left in Afghanistan.
[00:11:16.356 --> 00:11:24.680]  And now Al-Qaeda, Taliban says they're going to get safe passes through Iraq to go into Israel and now attack Israel from its eastern flank.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.061]  I've got that in the Associated Press.
[00:11:26.361 --> 00:11:27.902]  Now just believe AP, I went and checked.
[00:11:28.322 --> 00:11:32.444]  This is being announced by the Arab news and the Persian news out of Iran.
[00:11:33.564 --> 00:11:34.965]  So Israel stands down.
[00:11:39.568 --> 00:11:46.530]  You have seven million dollars at least in high-tech weapons handed over to the jihadis and then it gets worse.
[00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:49.371]  We have all the different videos and we'll show you one of these right now.
[00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:58.214]  There's dozens of these and it's hitting the news now of the jihadis and Hezbollah.
[00:11:59.954 --> 00:12:08.961]   Hezbollah funded Hamas with American and Western-made M-Force and Other U.S.
[00:12:09.021 --> 00:12:11.842]  government-issued standard sidearms.
[00:12:12.923 --> 00:12:31.290]  And there's footage of just piles of thousands of these weapons, including saws, medium machine guns, heavy machine guns, being handed out in the second wave of the invasion by Hamas, again funded by Hezbollah, the Iranians.
[00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:49.052]   And now we have Hamas and Hezbollah bragging that they bought on the black market Not just the machine guns, not just the rocket launchers, not just the hand grenades, but drones and anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft missiles from the black market out of Ukraine.
[00:12:50.433 --> 00:12:52.234]  And you can say, well, I don't believe Hezbollah or Hamas.
[00:12:52.334 --> 00:13:00.961]  OK, well, why did Biden give $7-plus billion of high-tech equipment, helicopters, jets, you name it, to the Taliban?
[00:13:01.857 --> 00:13:05.218]  Because if you can't evacuate, you know what the standard thing is.
[00:13:05.298 --> 00:13:12.681]  If you're given an order, pull out in one week, and they could have gotten those aircraft and things out, but if you can't, what do you do?
[00:13:13.461 --> 00:13:14.362]  You blow it up.
[00:13:15.862 --> 00:13:16.863]  You sabotage it.
[00:13:17.343 --> 00:13:18.523]  You burn it to the ground.
[00:13:19.484 --> 00:13:21.404]  Your base is being overrun, you gotta evacuate.
[00:13:21.744 --> 00:13:25.146]  You destroy the heavy equipment and you burn the files, you smash the computers.
[00:13:25.486 --> 00:13:26.046]  You burn it.
[00:13:29.588 --> 00:13:32.730]  At least $7 billion, and that's on the low end.
[00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.212]  Some estimates are $20 billion or more.
[00:13:36.673 --> 00:13:40.236]  So we have Ukraine supplying weapons via that black hole.
[00:13:40.596 --> 00:13:43.458]  You have Afghanistan via what Biden did supplying the weapons.
[00:13:43.578 --> 00:13:44.459]  And then it gets worse.
[00:13:44.839 --> 00:13:46.801]  You have the Israelis staying down, and then it gets worse.
[00:13:47.121 --> 00:13:48.622]  What's the cherry on top?
[00:13:48.862 --> 00:13:51.624]  There's a lot of little nuts and things and whipped cream we're going to add here.
[00:13:52.825 --> 00:13:53.266]  What is it?
[00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:58.484]  Who gave Iran last month $6 billion of their frozen assets?
[00:13:58.784 --> 00:14:02.426]  And then the Ayatollah told Lester Holt, I have the clip.
[00:14:04.627 --> 00:14:07.269]  Oh, we didn't say we'd use this for humanitarian.
[00:14:07.929 --> 00:14:11.692]  We'll use this for whatever we want.
[00:14:13.132 --> 00:14:15.494]  So Biden gives them $6 billion a month ago.
[00:14:16.595 --> 00:14:18.656]  Biden gives them $7 billion in weapons.
[00:14:20.797 --> 00:14:23.759]  A bunch of weapons come out of Ukraine, U.S.-NATO weapons.
[00:14:26.033 --> 00:14:27.073]  Israel stands down.
[00:14:27.513 --> 00:14:28.954]  Want me to keep going here for you?
[00:14:30.934 --> 00:14:32.294]  So then you say, well, who's behind it?
[00:14:32.354 --> 00:14:46.057]  Well, all of the defense agencies, all the bureaucracies, whether it's the Pentagon, or whether it's NATO, or whether it's Israel, or whether it's Hezbollah, whether it's Hamas, all of these groups are going to get more funding, more control out of the conflict.
[00:14:46.897 --> 00:14:50.157]  The leadership of all these countries is the same, basically.
[00:14:50.377 --> 00:14:54.018]  They don't care if a bunch of people get killed, because war is the health of the state.
[00:14:55.558 --> 00:14:56.759]  To quote many historians.
[00:14:59.702 --> 00:15:03.785]  War is the health of a corrupt, out-of-control, Napoleonic, or Hitlerian state.
[00:15:04.686 --> 00:15:05.927]  So those are the facts.
[00:15:06.427 --> 00:15:07.969]  Israel stood down.
[00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:15.075]  Not their people, not their average cop or average soldier, or even average intelligence agent.
[00:15:16.616 --> 00:15:19.719]  But the higher-ups guaranteed got the reports and started to come out.
[00:15:19.979 --> 00:15:20.780]  There was a build-up.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:26.522]   And Netanyahu, this is key, Has called this Israel's Pearl Harbor.
[00:15:26.542 --> 00:15:27.642]  Boy, isn't that perfect.
[00:15:28.382 --> 00:15:30.023]  I'm no fan of Imperial Japan in 1941.
[00:15:30.143 --> 00:15:40.167]  I'm no fan of them expanding and doing horrible slaughters of Filipinos and Chinese and others.
[00:15:41.092 --> 00:15:43.215]  And marching our troops on death marches.
[00:15:43.816 --> 00:15:57.593]  But I can also sit back and say, it came out in congressional testimony, it came out from the admirals before they died, that they knew the attack was coming within a few days, they knew about the Japanese fleet, they knew about submarines that had already been captured the day before and that morning before the attack.
[00:15:58.374 --> 00:15:59.595]  Running into reefs and things.
[00:15:59.655 --> 00:16:01.637]  They didn't have all the good sonar and things back then.
[00:16:02.218 --> 00:16:06.442]  They were capturing Japanese attack subs, midget subs, the day before and the day of.
[00:16:06.482 --> 00:16:07.303]  They knew it was happening.
[00:16:07.503 --> 00:16:09.686]  They had the aircraft carriers out to sea so they wouldn't be hit.
[00:16:09.966 --> 00:16:11.647]  The old obsolete battleships, they let them hit.
[00:16:11.667 --> 00:16:15.892]  Because they had to get Americans that were against the war into the war.
[00:16:18.678 --> 00:16:20.620]  And Churchill wrote about that in his memoirs.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.382]  So it doesn't mean the Japanese are good.
[00:16:23.402 --> 00:16:25.004]  It doesn't mean Hitler was good.
[00:16:25.564 --> 00:16:30.388]  It means that the West knew the attacks were coming and let the attack happen.
[00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:36.354]  And so, yes, just like they knew 9-11 was happening bare minimum and let that take place.
[00:16:37.375 --> 00:16:45.242]  And so this is the specifics again of what we've seen in history repeat over and over and over and over again.
[00:16:46.926 --> 00:16:49.189]  Let's pull back to a million feet here.
[00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.715]  And let's look at the big picture of BlackRock and Vanguard and State Street.
[00:16:54.915 --> 00:16:56.076]  They control 87-88% of the world's money.
[00:16:58.379 --> 00:17:10.386]  And that we're coming to the end of the old dollar hegemony, and new central bank digital currencies are coming out, and they want global controls, and they want an excuse for surveillance, and they want rationing of food, and they want to train you the good times are over.
[00:17:10.706 --> 00:17:17.130]  But if they do that, and they admit they're behind it, like they do in their white papers, the WEF and UN, you will remove them.
[00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:18.050]  You won't follow their orders.
[00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:32.198]   But if there's wars in Eastern Europe, in the Middle East, China has already basically started a war in the South China Sea, a thousand miles away from their coast, taking islands and attacking people in the Philippines.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:46.075]   That climate will then help them bring in what they thought World War I and World War II would be, a totally empowered United Nations in complete control.
[00:17:46.095 --> 00:18:01.710]  I mean, I gotta say, the footage of the hang gliders coming into the rave, where the early morning folks are still dancing on ecstasy and meth, and then here come the... I mean, this is like something out of the old Cobra cartoons in the 80s, when Cobra would do the same thing with motorized hang gliders.
[00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:03.211]  Cobra!
[00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:04.392]  Cobra!
[00:18:04.893 --> 00:18:06.374]  I mean, this is just out of control.
[00:18:06.674 --> 00:18:08.196]  And of course, that's the next big piece of this.
[00:18:09.761 --> 00:18:23.135]  You know that if you are Hamas or you're Hezbollah, that if you give a family $10,000 a year, their son or daughter will fight on the front lines for that money and probably be killed.
[00:18:23.695 --> 00:18:27.519]  If you give them a half million dollars or less, they will suicide bomb tomorrow.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.801]  You give the Palestinian families, grandmas, you give it to.
[00:18:33.141 --> 00:18:34.602]  Here's a half million bucks, sweetheart.
[00:18:35.142 --> 00:18:42.584]  Her firstborn son guaranteed and his little brother will go blow themselves up at Israeli checkpoint tomorrow.
[00:18:44.004 --> 00:18:49.669]   So six billion dollars gets given to Hezbollah, that's the Iranian group worldwide.
[00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:51.550]  They're serious, folks.
[00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.391]  I'm not putting the Muslims down.
[00:18:53.411 --> 00:18:58.393]  The Arabs have a lot of courage, but they usually get real emotional and aren't very well coordinated.
[00:18:58.853 --> 00:19:00.874]  The Persians are some of the best military people in the world.
[00:19:00.894 --> 00:19:01.634]  They're very smart.
[00:19:02.314 --> 00:19:05.696]  And that's who our Pentagon and other people have been really concerned about.
[00:19:06.076 --> 00:19:08.157]  And as soon as I saw this, I said, it'll be Hezbollah.
[00:19:08.993 --> 00:19:09.894]  And it was Hezbollah.
[00:19:10.434 --> 00:19:16.880]  Hezbollah trained them, they gave them the money, and then when the $6 billion came in, how many people can you give $100,000, $200,000, $300,000 to?
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.765]  That's usually on the high end.
[00:19:22.025 --> 00:19:23.687]  $100,000, most people will blow themselves up in the Middle East.
[00:19:25.228 --> 00:19:25.949]  You do it for your family.
[00:19:25.969 --> 00:19:26.950]  You go blow yourself up, they get $100,000.
[00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.952]  But they videotape it while they do it.
[00:19:30.453 --> 00:19:32.455]  They get even more if it gets a lot of attention.
[00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:37.111]  Sometimes suicide bombers get five, ten million dollars if they're a big cause celeb.
[00:19:37.352 --> 00:19:39.852]  They're rock stars in the Muslim world.
[00:19:40.633 --> 00:19:53.538]  Whether you're in India, whether you're in Malaysia, whether you're in Iraq, whether you're in Syria, whether you're in the Gaza Strip, whether you're in the Golan Heights, wherever you're at, you blow yourself up, killing infidels, particularly Jews, you get big money.
[00:19:53.998 --> 00:19:59.060]  So here, here's six billion dollars, and a month later they've now got the suicide money.
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.221]  Guys, do the math.
[00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:07.868]   Let's say Conservatively, 10,000 suicide soldiers on suicide missions attacked.
[00:20:07.888 --> 00:20:08.769]  They're now saying it's 20,000.
[00:20:09.109 --> 00:20:18.434]  How many times does 10,000 divide into, let's say they gave them half the money for suicide squads, the other half for weapons?
[00:20:19.055 --> 00:20:20.756]  Or this helped them replenish the money they'd already spent?
[00:20:21.416 --> 00:20:21.816]  Let me see.
[00:20:22.297 --> 00:20:26.299]  How many times does 10,000 divide into 6 billion?
[00:20:28.922 --> 00:20:35.987]  How many times does $10,000 divide into $6 billion?
[00:20:36.687 --> 00:20:38.428]  Or $5 point whatever, almost $6 billion.
[00:20:39.269 --> 00:20:39.609]  A lot.
[00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.691]  So what you saw is the money gets paid.
[00:20:43.912 --> 00:20:44.832]  It goes in the account.
[00:20:46.313 --> 00:20:47.994]  Usually get it after, but they got paid before.
[00:20:48.014 --> 00:20:53.318]  They're living in the worst squalor in the worst, they said the Gaza Strip is the worst place in the world.
[00:20:55.911 --> 00:20:59.354]  And then boom, here comes the suicide arming.
[00:21:04.158 --> 00:21:05.659]  So, you want me to keep giving you the knowledge?
[00:21:05.799 --> 00:21:07.740]  And I'm not bragging here, it's very frustrating.
[00:21:08.141 --> 00:21:12.124]  No other show is going to have this depth, this understanding of every perspective.
[00:21:15.856 --> 00:21:17.477]  I just instinctively tell the truth right away.
[00:21:17.557 --> 00:21:18.778]  I didn't do all this background research.
[00:21:18.798 --> 00:21:25.663]  I said, I said, Hezbollah and Iran's behind this through Hamas, and people are like, well, Jones, it's actually, they say it's Hamas.
[00:21:25.703 --> 00:21:27.144]  Yeah, the media says.
[00:21:27.884 --> 00:21:36.089]  So, if you pay 10,000 men and women, mainly men, how much did I say divided into what?
[00:21:40.452 --> 00:21:41.313]  Just turn your mic on.
[00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:45.630]  All right, so $6 billion divided by $10,000.
[00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:49.513]  I gotta wear my glasses.
[00:21:49.553 --> 00:21:50.774]  My eyes used to be perfect.
[00:21:50.794 --> 00:21:53.456]  2015 vision, now they're not that good, so I can't read the screen over there.
[00:21:53.996 --> 00:22:02.222]  So yeah, if you divide 10,000 people out of $6 billion, they got $600,000 apiece.
[00:22:02.602 --> 00:22:08.306]  How much did I say the high end is, the high average is for them?
[00:22:08.326 --> 00:22:08.306]  $500,000.
[00:22:08.386 --> 00:22:11.869]  For a suicide bomber, you can look it up.
[00:22:12.629 --> 00:22:13.310]  A suicide mission.
[00:22:14.943 --> 00:22:15.805]  This was a suicide measure.
[00:22:16.586 --> 00:22:18.991]  Well, they come up with $600,000.
[00:22:19.272 --> 00:22:20.694]  But let's say they only spent half of it.
[00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:23.510]  On the suicide payments.
[00:22:24.171 --> 00:22:24.631]  So that's $300,000.
[00:22:25.232 --> 00:22:33.439]  In fact, I bet it comes out that those suicide soldiers, mark your words, were paid $300,000 apiece.
[00:22:33.479 --> 00:22:35.401]  See, that's real intelligence.
[00:22:35.441 --> 00:22:44.369]  Not having some CIA credential or Mossad credential, but studying constantly, knowing world history, tracking what's going on, understanding.
[00:22:44.609 --> 00:22:46.571]  They admit they pay these people big money to do it.
[00:22:46.911 --> 00:22:47.872]  It came out of Iran.
[00:22:49.193 --> 00:22:52.534]  Some people that hate Israel are going to say, why are you being pro-Iran?
[00:22:52.994 --> 00:22:56.375]  Stating the facts that Israel clearly stood down.
[00:22:57.235 --> 00:23:01.476]  Stating the facts that Iran is involved.
[00:23:01.776 --> 00:23:02.957]  I'm not with the Israelis.
[00:23:03.297 --> 00:23:04.477]  I'm not with the Iranians.
[00:23:04.917 --> 00:23:06.258]  I'm not with any of these groups.
[00:23:06.618 --> 00:23:07.538]  I'm with the truth.
[00:23:08.848 --> 00:23:19.131]  Because only understanding how this works, only understanding how this goes on, only understanding how these manipulations take place is going to let us transcend this idiocy.
[00:23:19.971 --> 00:23:21.611]  The Pentagon is going to get record funding.
[00:23:22.511 --> 00:23:25.212]  The domestic police state of the American people is going to get expanded.
[00:23:26.292 --> 00:23:27.653]  Europe is going to expand its tyranny.
[00:23:27.913 --> 00:23:30.033]  The weapon manufacturers are going to make more money.
[00:23:30.053 --> 00:23:31.173]  Iran is going to look more powerful.
[00:23:31.534 --> 00:23:32.914]  It's going to get more control in the area.
[00:23:34.073 --> 00:23:36.374]  The Hamas leadership is going to get more funding and power.
[00:23:36.534 --> 00:23:37.535]  Their people are going to get killed.
[00:23:37.795 --> 00:23:38.515]  They don't care.
[00:23:38.756 --> 00:23:43.738]  Their mothers will take $100,000 for their son to go blow themselves up.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.720]  Some do it for nothing.
[00:23:50.142 --> 00:23:51.783]  On average, a few hundred thousand dollars.
[00:23:54.144 --> 00:23:55.765]  Now you know where that $6 billion went.
[00:23:58.246 --> 00:24:06.721]   Buying the weapons That our government let them get in Afghanistan and in Ukraine.
[00:24:07.421 --> 00:24:08.602]  Those are facts.
[00:24:09.163 --> 00:24:09.603]  Facts.
[00:24:12.225 --> 00:24:12.665]  Facts.
[00:24:13.246 --> 00:24:14.707]  Those are reality points.
[00:24:14.807 --> 00:24:22.652]  So, it's not as easy as just saying Israelis good, Hamas bad, or Hamas good, Israelis bad.
[00:24:22.692 --> 00:24:22.972]  It's not.
[00:24:23.153 --> 00:24:24.854]  See, that's easy and mindless, isn't it?
[00:24:28.211 --> 00:24:32.112]  You can see the dead Israelis, and they don't deserve to die, and they kidnap women and children.
[00:24:32.172 --> 00:24:32.612]  It's terrible.
[00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:41.034]  But let's pull back and ask, who at the highest levels allowed all these weapons and all this money to be transferred?
[00:24:41.114 --> 00:24:41.794]  We know.
[00:24:42.194 --> 00:24:45.635]  Joe Biden, meaning Barack Obama, and the globalists.
[00:24:45.695 --> 00:24:48.075]  And then you tune in to MSNBC and CNN.
[00:24:48.395 --> 00:24:55.217]  They are attacking Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he is getting powerful out of this, and even telling the truth that he stood down.
[00:24:56.323 --> 00:24:58.004]  This is internal fighting in these globalist groups.
[00:24:58.645 --> 00:25:03.749]  And then you've got them saying, oh, Hezbollah and Hamas really had a reason to do this.
[00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:05.891]  I've got the videos.
[00:25:05.911 --> 00:25:06.451]  You want to see them?
[00:25:07.912 --> 00:25:12.496]  MSNBC reporter criticizes Israel, claims Hamas attacks deserve context.
[00:25:15.699 --> 00:25:16.840]  Liberals all over the U.S.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.923]  praising and celebrating what Hamas has done via Hezbollah's funding.
[00:25:21.123 --> 00:25:21.924]  And then it gets worse.
[00:25:23.817 --> 00:25:27.038]  We've had tens of millions come in the last two and a half years under Biden.
[00:25:27.778 --> 00:25:32.860]  And they reported thousands a day from Middle Eastern countries, almost all military men, military age men.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.742]  The Iranians are serious business and they do have sleeper cells right in the town where I live.
[00:25:38.962 --> 00:25:41.102]  And they've got them in your city and your town too.
[00:25:41.302 --> 00:25:42.983]  And they're ready to blow up the power stations.
[00:25:43.243 --> 00:25:44.763]  They're ready to attack the police stations.
[00:25:44.964 --> 00:25:46.284]  They're ready to attack the synagogues.
[00:25:46.524 --> 00:25:48.245]  They're ready to poison the water supplies.
[00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:49.805]  They're ready to kill you.
[00:25:51.886 --> 00:25:56.765]   And then when they attack, Biden won't get in trouble, or whoever they put in.
[00:25:57.045 --> 00:26:00.808]  It'll be, oh we gotta take all your liberties, oh intelligence failure, we're sorry.
[00:26:00.828 --> 00:26:05.071]  And I think you'll be so upset because Hezbollah attacks a bunch of U.S.
[00:26:05.111 --> 00:26:05.471]  cities.
[00:26:09.113 --> 00:26:15.838]  Or they'll do it through a cutout group so they don't get the blame, and then that'll give the globalists even more power, just like Benjamin Netanyahu did.
[00:26:16.078 --> 00:26:19.961]  So I'm talking about the end result of what this does, no matter what quote team you're on.
[00:26:20.241 --> 00:26:21.322]  I'm on team reality.
[00:26:21.602 --> 00:26:22.823]  I'm on team don't be a chump.
[00:26:23.144 --> 00:26:24.845]  I'm on a team million foot view.
[00:26:25.746 --> 00:26:28.588]  But I can also zoom in to one inch view.
[00:26:29.008 --> 00:26:29.769]  Point blank range.
[00:26:32.331 --> 00:26:36.314]  So we're gonna lay all this out today and where it's going, but then there's the other big takeaway.
[00:26:37.159 --> 00:26:50.084]  Going back 20-30 years ago, the Israeli government really started accelerating the arming of their citizens everywhere, but more and more they brought in people out of Europe and other areas that don't want guns, and so it's reported that less than a third of the households had weapons.
[00:26:50.685 --> 00:27:03.790]  If you're living right up against two and a half million people who want to kill your ass and there's a fence blocking them, you are insane if you don't live in a house with foot-thick walls and if you don't have every damn weapon you can get your hands on.
[00:27:06.889 --> 00:27:13.615]  Like, you attack us here at this office, we got armed people here, they're trained security guards, and almost all of us are carrying a gun.
[00:27:14.016 --> 00:27:16.959]  So, you might get some of us, but we're gonna get you, too.
[00:27:17.239 --> 00:27:21.683]  You're not gonna be dragging us out by our hair while you're off to some torture camp.
[00:27:22.544 --> 00:27:30.872]  So, that's the lesson here, too, is that these jihadist target groups that they know are disarmed are not heavily armed.
[00:27:32.014 --> 00:27:33.594]  So, this is serious.
[00:27:33.854 --> 00:27:36.295]  We'll talk about what comes after all this next.
[00:27:37.075 --> 00:27:39.096]  Because you tune in for tomorrow's news today, don't you?
[00:27:39.896 --> 00:27:41.636]  We'll talk about it all here today.
[00:27:42.277 --> 00:27:46.898]  Then on this one subject, it's a huge subject, we'll open the phones up in the second hour tonight.
[00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:47.998]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:27:47.837 --> 00:27:54.837]  The Court of Freedom is Infowars.com and Bandai Video.
[00:27:54.837 --> 00:28:09.837]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:28:09.967 --> 00:28:14.629]  The biggest banks, the biggest investment firms in the world are cutting off the fertilizer.
[00:28:15.489 --> 00:28:16.910]  They're cutting off the food and water.
[00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:22.493]  And they're funding wars and conflicts at a level never before seen in the history of civilization.
[00:28:23.439 --> 00:28:27.642]  They're building an Anglo world that Klaus Schwab and WEF talked about.
[00:28:28.163 --> 00:28:30.425]  So I'm pulling back and looking at the big picture here.
[00:28:31.205 --> 00:28:32.306]  What comes next?
[00:28:33.187 --> 00:28:35.189]  Not just in Israel, but around the world.
[00:28:35.629 --> 00:28:36.730]  What does this signify?
[00:28:37.391 --> 00:28:40.833]  Why did Jack Posobiec did a great job in the last six months predicting all this?
[00:28:41.814 --> 00:28:44.777]  So did a lot of other people like Mike Cernovich and myself.
[00:28:46.189 --> 00:28:47.690]  Because you can see what's going on.
[00:28:48.031 --> 00:28:53.075]  The Pentagon didn't give $7 billion of weapons to the Taliban-slash-Al Qaeda for no reason.
[00:28:53.756 --> 00:28:56.118]  They don't give them billions a month still for no reason.
[00:28:57.099 --> 00:28:59.281]  They didn't allow these weapons out of Ukraine for no reason.
[00:28:59.761 --> 00:29:01.503]  Israel didn't stand down for no reason.
[00:29:02.264 --> 00:29:04.606]  Biden didn't give $6 billion to Iran for no reason.
[00:29:06.667 --> 00:29:08.508]  The border's not wide open in the U.S.
[00:29:08.528 --> 00:29:09.088]  for no reason.
[00:29:09.348 --> 00:29:14.870]  In the Texas sector, thousands of Muslims, thousands of Middle Easterners, sometimes a week, being caught.
[00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:16.351]  That's in the local news.
[00:29:17.111 --> 00:29:18.272]  Military-age men.
[00:29:19.932 --> 00:29:21.133]  Real sleeper cells.
[00:29:21.833 --> 00:29:22.873]  Real Hezbollah.
[00:29:23.474 --> 00:29:24.754]  This is Hezbollah.
[00:29:25.635 --> 00:29:26.375]  Hezbollah.
[00:29:27.235 --> 00:29:28.536]  Hezbollah's behind this.
[00:29:28.956 --> 00:29:32.197]  Hezbollah was given $6 billion by Joe Biden last month.
[00:29:33.038 --> 00:29:33.858]  Hezbollah.
[00:29:34.977 --> 00:29:36.919]  The Iranian special ops.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.683]  They're plainclothes sleeper cells.
[00:29:39.983 --> 00:29:41.064]  They're infiltrators.
[00:29:42.286 --> 00:29:44.188]  And when they attack us, and they will.
[00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:47.272]  That's the deal the left has with them.
[00:29:50.754 --> 00:29:53.915]  Iran will get a few of its cities hit, but we'll have all our rights taken.
[00:29:54.415 --> 00:29:58.137]  And the mullahs will be put more firmly in power because of the conflict with the West.
[00:29:58.757 --> 00:30:14.142]  There's sick backroom deals going on, and Donald Trump warned of it a month ago, saying this $6 billion will be used for suicide bombers to fund them, and you just saw a giant suicide army slam into southern Israel, central Israel, and now they're attacking from the north.
[00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:22.857]  So all the fools that want to blow up Israel and think it's all just a simple, one-dimensional thing, we're all walking into Armageddon here.
[00:30:23.998 --> 00:30:41.025]  And whether you're a Palestinian, or whether you're an Israeli, or whether you're a Ukrainian, or a Russian, or American, or Taiwanese, or Chinese, it hurts the people, but it helps the New World Order for their global destabilization to bring in their planetary rule, their one-world currencies, their total police state controls.
[00:30:42.247 --> 00:30:45.149]  Did our government get in trouble for allowing 9-11 to happen, bare minimum?
[00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:47.371]  No, they got incredible power and funding.
[00:30:48.552 --> 00:30:52.755]  And now they admit Homeland Security is for Trump supporters, and Christians, and Catholics, and Conservatives.
[00:30:53.776 --> 00:30:56.638]  And they're getting ready to do it again, and they just did it in Israel!
[00:30:58.259 --> 00:31:07.146]  So the people of Israel need to march and demonstrate, and need to demand to know who stood down, and they need to have the whistleblowers go public, and expose it, because they're already starting to go public.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:15.604]  You had an army preparing all these equipment, all these weapons, all these missiles, running around like army ants everywhere.
[00:31:15.624 --> 00:31:18.306]  They had their satellites.
[00:31:18.346 --> 00:31:20.967]  They had their data collection.
[00:31:20.987 --> 00:31:21.808]  They had their surveillance.
[00:31:21.828 --> 00:31:23.128]  They had their on-the-ground spies.
[00:31:24.309 --> 00:31:34.996]  And now you've got Hezbollah and Hamas demonstrators in Florida and New York and California celebrating in the streets.
[00:31:37.162 --> 00:31:39.483]  Because they got the green light from Biden to do this.
[00:31:41.564 --> 00:31:43.345]  The globalists won a worldwide crisis.
[00:31:43.365 --> 00:31:45.546]  Here's John Bowne's latest report.
[00:31:46.167 --> 00:31:47.667]  Just went live at Bandot Video.
[00:31:47.988 --> 00:31:50.469]  It's also on Infowars.com.
[00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:52.390]  Need to share it?
[00:31:53.791 --> 00:31:56.492]  Biden's Iranian handout threatens national security.
[00:31:56.892 --> 00:31:57.432]  Think so?
[00:31:57.552 --> 00:31:58.552]  Here it is.
[00:31:58.552 --> 00:32:16.271]   A beast in the Middle East has been unleashed as a spokesperson for Hamas declared that
[00:32:16.271 --> 00:32:22.591]   Operation Al-Aqsa flood had begun and that they had decided to "put an end to all the
[00:32:22.591 --> 00:32:25.231]  crimes of the occupation of Israel."
[00:32:25.352 --> 00:32:28.934]  Their time for rampaging without being held accountable is over.
[00:32:29.935 --> 00:32:35.157]  5,000 rockets were then fired in a first strike within 20 minutes, landing as far as Jerusalem.
[00:32:35.557 --> 00:32:50.984]   As Hamas soldiers As we speak, Palestinian gunmen are inside Israeli cities and towns, something we have never before seen on this scale.
[00:32:51.324 --> 00:32:55.426]  And they are fighting running gun battles against Israeli ground forces.
[00:32:55.466 --> 00:33:06.111]  Hamas, the major Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza, says they have taken Israelis hostage and they have taken them back inside of Gaza.
[00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:14.592]  Deep State Military Industrial Complex Puppet Administration's quest to start wars all over the world has hit a new milestone.
[00:33:14.973 --> 00:33:33.796]  As far as intelligence is concerned, certainly the CIA and other intelligence services around the globe are going to be providing the Israelis whatever information they might be able to uncover about external support, whether or not Iran was actually involved in this, as well as any indications about where these hostages may be held or what's going on there.
[00:33:34.136 --> 00:33:53.965]  In a move to outdo the criminal neglect waged on our military and the foreign policy nightmare that launched Joe Biden's presidency in Afghanistan and to unravel President Trump's historic Abraham Accords that brought peace to the Middle East, Joe Biden's Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, authorized the inevitable massacre in Israel.
[00:33:54.065 --> 00:34:03.294]  On the anniversary of 9-11, the Biden White House just struck a deal with Iran to do a prisoner swap and release $6 billion in frozen Iranian funds.
[00:34:03.314 --> 00:34:04.976]  They're going to swap five U.S.
[00:34:04.996 --> 00:34:06.838]  prisoners for five Iranian prisoners.
[00:34:07.299 --> 00:34:08.740]  Your reaction to this breaking news?
[00:34:09.701 --> 00:34:17.206]  Biden, Obama, the $1.2 billion in cash we sent to Iran, in cash, and what did it get us?
[00:34:17.286 --> 00:34:20.508]  They didn't change their policy, and now we're sending even more money.
[00:34:20.848 --> 00:34:28.053]  Remember, this is a nation that has done recent maritime operations in the Persian Gulf with Russia, with China, and now Iran.
[00:34:28.493 --> 00:34:31.595]  Their attitude hasn't changed, their conduct hasn't changed.
[00:34:31.875 --> 00:34:32.916]  This is outrageous.
[00:34:33.456 --> 00:34:34.737]  This has got to stop.
[00:34:34.957 --> 00:34:36.438]  This administration is nuts.
[00:34:36.838 --> 00:34:46.083]  The one thing I'll say, having formerly been the hostage negotiator for the United States, I'm glad to see those Americans getting home to their families, and God bless them.
[00:34:46.603 --> 00:34:53.887]  It's not their fault that the Biden administration cut such a bad deal, and they couldn't negotiate their way out of a paper bag with the Iranians.
[00:34:53.987 --> 00:35:12.555]   But giving the Iranians $6 billion to then invest that in their nuclear program, their ballistic missile program, and their terrorist proxies with Qatib Hezbollah in Iraq, Or Lebanon or Hamas in Gaza or the Houthis in Yemen is a bad idea.
[00:35:12.935 --> 00:35:26.919]  Meanwhile, as the American border is overrun, we've known for over a decade that the Lebanese Hezbollah network, an arm of Iranian terror, has positioned itself in Mexico with a massive arms stockpile.
[00:35:27.478 --> 00:35:34.160]  It was 2002 when a trial here at the federal courthouse revealed there was a cell of a Hezbollah terrorist operating in Charlotte.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:40.082]  It was shocking then, even more surprising now that terrorism officials say Hezbollah is still here.
[00:35:40.442 --> 00:35:43.983]  Are you currently investigating Hezbollah cells in North Carolina?
[00:35:44.543 --> 00:35:44.723]  Yes.
[00:35:45.304 --> 00:35:52.906]  At this very moment, establishing cells within the United States in lockstep with their Mexican cartel allies.
[00:35:53.246 --> 00:35:53.947]  This is Mark.
[00:35:54.307 --> 00:35:55.769]  He grew up in South Austin.
[00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:57.752]  Normal suburbia, he calls it.
[00:35:58.092 --> 00:36:06.904]  Went to college, waited tables, and in his 20s, he ran drugs for one of the oldest, largest, most profitable drug cartels in Mexico.
[00:36:08.385 --> 00:36:12.529]  A dangerous occupation that earned him a salary of $10,000 a week.
[00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:16.373]  How does a Mexican drug cartel blend in in Austin?
[00:36:16.693 --> 00:36:19.797]  I mean, do I look like what they look like?
[00:36:20.297 --> 00:36:25.863]  Meanwhile, Iran's parliament chants, death to Israel, death to America.
[00:36:30.476 --> 00:36:43.186]  A horrific but obvious outcome made possible by the billions of taxpayer dollars handed over to the Iranian regime by a Biden administration that has become a danger to worldwide stability.
[00:36:43.506 --> 00:36:44.667]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:36:47.789 --> 00:36:51.012]  Alright, that report's live at BandotVideo and Infowars.com.
[00:36:52.032 --> 00:36:53.553]  Okay, so let's talk facts here.
[00:36:53.654 --> 00:36:56.215]  What's the next layer of this?
[00:36:56.796 --> 00:36:58.017]  Or the inner circle of it?
[00:37:00.106 --> 00:37:01.807]  Russia has won the war in Ukraine.
[00:37:02.268 --> 00:37:03.729]  Ukraine has totally collapsed.
[00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:08.672]  China has encircled Taiwan, is doing drills daily to invade.
[00:37:09.213 --> 00:37:14.817]  It's expanded 1,000 miles out from their coast into the Philippines, the South, the Spratly Islands, and others, the North.
[00:37:15.858 --> 00:37:18.440]  And they are saying they may invade imminently.
[00:37:20.822 --> 00:37:23.003]  This is all a distraction from what's happening in Ukraine.
[00:37:23.023 --> 00:37:29.068]  But the big issue is, why was $7 million of weapons given to the Taliban that made its way there?
[00:37:29.741 --> 00:37:30.141]  Bye-bye.
[00:37:30.241 --> 00:37:33.582]  Why was $6 billion given a month ago exactly to them?
[00:37:35.423 --> 00:37:37.864]  Why is this not even being picked up more by the media?
[00:37:37.924 --> 00:37:39.325]  What is the larger picture?
[00:37:40.865 --> 00:37:41.845]  Why is this being done?
[00:37:41.905 --> 00:37:46.407]  Because clearly, the WEF has had a new talking point.
[00:37:46.447 --> 00:37:47.428]  Not just one of their members.
[00:37:48.028 --> 00:38:00.425]   I saw a compilation video a few days ago that I meant to play on Friday, I didn't get to, where it showed more than eight of the WEF leaders saying, we've used COVID to set up our world government, We've used global warming, man-made global warming as a pretext.
[00:38:00.885 --> 00:38:02.786]  Now we're going to cut the water off and say that.
[00:38:03.186 --> 00:38:05.406]  But also they can use Islamic terror.
[00:38:06.087 --> 00:38:09.628]  So they've just recharged the batteries of Shias and Sunnis.
[00:38:10.908 --> 00:38:12.349]  And that makes up 95% of the Muslim world.
[00:38:12.169 --> 00:38:19.149]  percent of the Muslim world. Eighty percent are Sunnis.
[00:38:19.149 --> 00:38:21.608]  Close to it.
[00:38:20.124 --> 00:38:22.625]  Close to 20% are Shiite.
[00:38:22.925 --> 00:38:26.567]  There's a few percentage points that are Alawites and other groups that aren't involved in all this.
[00:38:26.587 --> 00:38:28.087]  The Kurds and other groups.
[00:38:28.147 --> 00:38:30.508]  But that's what they're setting up.
[00:38:31.769 --> 00:38:35.090]  And so you're like, well why would the government allow this to happen?
[00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:57.150]   Because when Hezbollah and Hamas that are deeply allied with the Democratic Party and with Antifa and with AOC and with The squad, Gilhart, Omar, and the rest of them, who are all basically praising us right now, when they attack folks, it'll be you that loses your freedoms.
[00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:58.830]  It'll be you that gets spied on.
[00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:01.031]  Remember what came out last week?
[00:39:01.631 --> 00:39:13.193]  Twelve-plus senior, former, and current FBI agents said, we're being trained, the main threat is Trump supporters, Christians and Catholics, homeschoolers, people protesting critical race Syria.
[00:39:14.235 --> 00:39:14.915]  School board bags.
[00:39:15.496 --> 00:39:17.216]  And we think it's dangerous and out of control.
[00:39:17.236 --> 00:39:18.317]  Remember all that this week?
[00:39:19.197 --> 00:39:22.338]  So they set up the police state grid to counter Russia in the Cold War.
[00:39:22.639 --> 00:39:23.479]  It was always for us.
[00:39:23.999 --> 00:39:26.000]  They expanded it to fight, quote, radical Islam.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.481]  It was always for us, the American people.
[00:39:29.642 --> 00:39:33.083]  And now they publicly say the main focus is the American people.
[00:39:34.324 --> 00:39:37.745]  The most dangerous thing is white supremacists, even though it's an extremely rare event.
[00:39:38.705 --> 00:39:41.867]  And now the border is wide open, bringing these people in, en masse.
[00:39:43.357 --> 00:39:44.818]  Newsweek talks about the enemy within.
[00:39:44.838 --> 00:39:51.482]  FBI targets Trump supporters as the 2024 election nears.
[00:39:52.443 --> 00:39:57.846]  Yes, the enemy is people that walked in between the velvet ropes on January 6th.
[00:39:59.027 --> 00:40:14.080]   And the main focus of Homeland Security and the DHS is prosecuting Thousands and thousands, over 5,000 people right now, including Owen Schroer, our reporter, to try to stop people going to the building about to serve two months in federal prison on the 24th of this month.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.101]  He'll be in prison for free speech.
[00:40:18.121 --> 00:40:21.343]  The judge said for free speech, said it in the sentencing.
[00:40:22.103 --> 00:40:26.945]  He said, you still, last month, public document, you put the transcript up.
[00:40:27.526 --> 00:40:29.847]  You still last month said the election was stolen.
[00:40:31.207 --> 00:40:32.468]  You are going to prison.
[00:40:34.056 --> 00:40:40.241]  Or a misdemeanor of being on the Capitol grounds when we had a permit to be there for the stage, trying to get people to that stage.
[00:40:41.382 --> 00:40:45.286]  So, Owen Schroer, now has a criminal record, no criminal record before.
[00:40:45.947 --> 00:40:50.290]  In high school, he worked with mentally retarded children through Catholic Charities.
[00:40:51.291 --> 00:40:53.633]  The guy's Mr. America, Mr. Boy Scout.
[00:40:54.094 --> 00:40:55.195]  He gets to go to jail.
[00:40:56.596 --> 00:41:03.462]  But all the criminals pouring across the southern border, the military-age men, 90% of them are military-age men, they're just fine.
[00:41:03.962 --> 00:41:05.503]  That's our bankrupt government.
[00:41:05.544 --> 00:41:26.763]   Because when Hezbollah and Hamas attack, They got tens of thousands, conservatively, probably 100,000 people that have already been paid when they get the cell phone order to go car bomb or bomb or suicide bomb or shoot people or poison a water supply or take hostages.
[00:41:27.163 --> 00:41:28.044]  They aren't going to wait.
[00:41:28.484 --> 00:41:32.528]  They are going to scream, Allah Akbar!
[00:41:33.008 --> 00:41:34.309]  And they're going to go attack us.
[00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:37.712]  And then we're going to get to see Homeland Security pose as a savior.
[00:41:38.253 --> 00:41:39.154]  Disgusting!
[00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:47.558]  Barack Obama, Biden, the Democratic Party, the leadership of the Justice Department, the FBI, they are to blame for leaving us wide open.
[00:41:47.898 --> 00:41:50.000]  They are to blame for giving $6 billion to Iran.
[00:41:50.301 --> 00:41:52.963]  They are to blame for giving $7 billion to the Taliban of weapons.
[00:41:53.364 --> 00:41:58.489]  They are to blame for pumping all the weapons into Ukraine, and fast and furious before that, we now went to ISIS.
[00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.813]  That was the Attorney General under Obama.
[00:42:02.796 --> 00:42:03.296]  Eric Holder.
[00:42:03.757 --> 00:42:04.837]  They were on the same play.
[00:42:04.857 --> 00:42:08.759]  Remember, it came out in government documents that Obama got hundreds of millions of U.S.
[00:42:08.799 --> 00:42:14.662]  taxpayer money to try to fund that jihad that took over our ally, the Egyptian government.
[00:42:14.883 --> 00:42:25.728]  They blew up hundreds of churches, killed hundreds of thousands of Christians and others, and then the Egyptians were able to kick the CIA out and take control of their government again.
[00:42:26.009 --> 00:42:28.090]  They want jihadis in control of the governments.
[00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:38.556]   They don't want Middle Eastern countries to have hotels and tourist meccas and No, they want radical jihadis in control because they need that threat.
[00:42:38.616 --> 00:42:46.142]  They don't run the jihadis, they fund them, they protect them, they open the door to them.
[00:42:46.823 --> 00:42:50.446]  Obama promised 800 million in aid to the Arab Spring and he did it, Reuters.
[00:42:51.326 --> 00:42:57.251]  Folks, you can write down everything I say and you can look it up and it's true, okay?
[00:42:58.492 --> 00:43:00.314]  I have a small margin of error.
[00:43:01.823 --> 00:43:05.705]  And a lot of times people say, whoa, they're saying it's Hamas yesterday.
[00:43:06.025 --> 00:43:08.226]  People are in the comments on InfoWars after the live show.
[00:43:08.647 --> 00:43:09.287]  We archived it.
[00:43:09.327 --> 00:43:11.308]  They said, look at Jones saying it's Hezbollah.
[00:43:11.528 --> 00:43:12.649]  This guy has no understanding.
[00:43:12.709 --> 00:43:13.189]  It's Hamas.
[00:43:13.449 --> 00:43:15.030]  Can he read the news today?
[00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:19.712]  Hamas says the attacks on Israel were backed mainly by Iran.
[00:43:19.972 --> 00:43:20.913]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:43:21.793 --> 00:43:26.236]  Hamas spokesperson says Iran gave support to surprise attack on Israel.
[00:43:26.716 --> 00:43:28.777]  Israel blames Iran for Hamas attack.
[00:43:29.497 --> 00:43:30.578]  A message from Iran.
[00:43:31.621 --> 00:43:32.022]  See that?
[00:43:34.184 --> 00:43:35.746]  This is tomorrow's news today.
[00:43:36.107 --> 00:43:39.050]  I'm not sitting around watching the NFL.
[00:43:40.592 --> 00:43:43.536]  I'm not sitting around playing tiddlywinks.
[00:43:44.677 --> 00:43:45.858]  All I do is study this.
[00:43:46.499 --> 00:43:47.641]  All I do is look at this.
[00:43:48.121 --> 00:43:50.084]  And I'm telling you it's crystal clear now.
[00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:54.311]  They're going to use the environmental fairmonger to cut off the energy.
[00:43:54.571 --> 00:43:55.611]  They're going to devalue the dollar.
[00:43:55.851 --> 00:44:01.392]  They're going to bring in all these people, ploward and pivot, to break the social welfare net and the social contract.
[00:44:01.773 --> 00:44:12.355]  And then they're going to allow Islamic forces to launch massive terror attacks across Europe, across the UK, across the United States, across Canada, and there won't be put two and two together.
[00:44:12.795 --> 00:44:14.236]  Our governments let them in.
[00:44:14.696 --> 00:44:15.896]  Our governments arm them.
[00:44:16.276 --> 00:44:19.517]  Our governments are hijacked and waging war against us.
[00:44:21.195 --> 00:44:25.917]  And yes, I'm sad for the Israelis that were killed, and I denounce Hamas and Hezbollah.
[00:44:26.437 --> 00:44:32.559]  And I denounce those, Biden and others, that gave them the money and gave them the weapons through Ukraine and through Afghanistan.
[00:44:33.599 --> 00:44:42.480]   And I don't know exactly who's guilty in Israel, because I'm not involved in that Internal war in Israel.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.623]  60% of Jews on average don't like Netanyahu.
[00:44:46.184 --> 00:44:49.227]  They don't like the judicial reforms they say is a tyranny.
[00:44:49.287 --> 00:44:50.448]  It looks like freedom to me.
[00:44:50.728 --> 00:44:52.350]  And they use the Jews as guinea pigs.
[00:44:52.811 --> 00:44:54.813]  So I stand with the people of Israel.
[00:44:55.313 --> 00:44:59.238]  And I want a better life for the people that are in the Gaza Strip and other places.
[00:44:59.358 --> 00:45:00.038]  I want peace.
[00:45:00.359 --> 00:45:02.061]  But I'm pulling back, looking at the big picture.
[00:45:04.062 --> 00:45:05.442]  Why did Israel stand down?
[00:45:05.602 --> 00:45:06.802]  That's guaranteed to happen.
[00:45:07.023 --> 00:45:09.343]  Why did our government give $7 billion in weapons to the Taliban?
[00:45:09.583 --> 00:45:11.523]  Why did they give $6 billion to Iran last month?
[00:45:12.383 --> 00:45:14.304]  Why did they pump all the weapons into Ukraine?
[00:45:14.544 --> 00:45:16.544]  Why are they shipping me a fast and furious ISIS?
[00:45:16.904 --> 00:45:19.085]  Because it's a replay of the same thing.
[00:45:19.285 --> 00:45:21.465]  Our government funds Al-Qaeda slash ISIS.
[00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:31.747]  They attack Syria and then we ally with Al-Qaeda and so did Israel to attack Syria and Assad when they did nothing and try to remove them.
[00:45:32.987 --> 00:45:34.848]  And Netanyahu was involved in that.
[00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:37.871]  And so was Obama before it.
[00:45:38.271 --> 00:45:41.373]  And Trump and Vladimir Putin put a stop to it.
[00:45:41.914 --> 00:45:43.094]  Because Trump wants peace.
[00:45:45.456 --> 00:45:49.839]  So whether you're Netanyahu or his opposition, they're just as bad in leadership.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.681]  Or whether you're Biden.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:58.742]  Or whether you're NATO and Stoltenberg and all of them are the same crisis creators.
[00:45:58.762 --> 00:46:01.183]  They get power out of the hysteria.
[00:46:01.403 --> 00:46:02.744]  How did Hitler become a dictator?
[00:46:03.044 --> 00:46:06.245]  Burning up his own government building the Reichstag on February 27, 1933.
[00:46:09.666 --> 00:46:12.027]  It's the same tricks, the same playbooks.
[00:46:12.787 --> 00:46:14.068]  I hate the German government.
[00:46:16.569 --> 00:46:17.929]  The corrupt globalists they've got in there.
[00:46:18.029 --> 00:46:19.370]  I hate our corrupt government.
[00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:20.030]  It's not our government.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.801]  And I don't like what the Israeli government's doing either.
[00:46:25.841 --> 00:46:27.802]  And I don't like what the Iranian government's doing.
[00:46:28.202 --> 00:46:29.583]  I don't like these governments.
[00:46:29.863 --> 00:46:37.505]  Because they got the same dirty Machiavellian playbooks they use over and over and over and over.
[00:46:37.645 --> 00:46:38.366]  And it gets worse.
[00:46:38.226 --> 00:46:40.226]  Now for this.
[00:46:40.226 --> 00:46:42.226]  [Pause]
[00:46:42.226 --> 00:46:44.226]  [Pause]
[00:46:44.226 --> 00:46:46.226]  [Pause]
[00:46:46.226 --> 00:46:48.226]  Biden knows that Russia has won the war.
[00:46:47.914 --> 00:46:54.216]  Biden knows Americans are tired of the hundreds of billions we've sent to Ukraine while our cities rot and our veterans commit suicide.
[00:46:56.317 --> 00:47:00.219]  While the average American goes bankrupt, 60-something percent are hand-to-mouth right now.
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:02.900]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:47:04.441 --> 00:47:04.941]  Look at this.
[00:47:06.001 --> 00:47:11.904]  Biden may ask Congress for a $100 billion Ukraine aid package because he knows support's waning.
[00:47:12.184 --> 00:47:19.708]   So instead of getting $267 million a week, He wants $100 billion for the next year up front.
[00:47:20.268 --> 00:47:22.549]  Biden said request $100 billion.
[00:47:25.771 --> 00:47:26.751]  Putin's being misquoted.
[00:47:26.791 --> 00:47:27.711]  I actually watched the clip.
[00:47:27.971 --> 00:47:29.632]  They're saying he says the war will be over in a week.
[00:47:30.232 --> 00:47:32.753]  Putin said the war could be over in a week if the funding's cut.
[00:47:33.073 --> 00:47:34.614]  And Trump knows that too.
[00:47:36.615 --> 00:47:39.516]  Hamas surprise attack a historic failure for Israel.
[00:47:40.356 --> 00:47:41.637]  Nope, they knew it was coming.
[00:47:43.188 --> 00:47:46.351]  The compartmentalization, 99% of the Jews didn't know it was coming.
[00:47:46.971 --> 00:47:47.952]  But the leadership knew.
[00:47:51.275 --> 00:48:01.944]  And Israel's been basically in a soft civil war, not going along with the being guinea pigs, not going along with losing their rights and becoming a governmental plutocracy, oligarchy.
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.301]  And so now the Jews are going to get in line, aren't they?
[00:48:05.961 --> 00:48:08.242]  Now they're going to kill the Arabs and Palestinians.
[00:48:08.623 --> 00:48:10.083]  Now they're going to get in line.
[00:48:10.403 --> 00:48:12.484]  Now they're not going to protest and crash at riot police.
[00:48:12.765 --> 00:48:14.105]  Now they're going to learn their lesson.
[00:48:14.325 --> 00:48:20.268]  Just like Americans in 9-11, when they let Islamists be involved and the globals were involved as well, attack us.
[00:48:20.588 --> 00:48:22.649]  And then the same thing is about to be done here.
[00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:30.386]   Mark my words, very soon, Islamists are going to hit Europe, They're going to hit Israel more.
[00:48:30.606 --> 00:48:31.988]  They're going to hit the United States.
[00:48:32.268 --> 00:48:33.229]  They're going to hit Canada.
[00:48:33.509 --> 00:48:45.299]  And in all these countries, the intelligence agencies and the security apparatus is going to use that to take more of our freedoms and legitimize the police state they've shut up that's for us.
[00:48:48.121 --> 00:48:50.183]  Hamas is the same parasitic group.
[00:48:51.499 --> 00:48:58.344]  Hezbollah acts just the same as the Israeli leadership, and as the EU leadership, and as our leadership.
[00:48:58.364 --> 00:49:01.706]  They're all the sick, satanic brain people.
[00:49:02.186 --> 00:49:04.407]  They can be Arab, they can be Jew, they can be German.
[00:49:04.788 --> 00:49:07.590]   These sick politicians Act the same.
[00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:11.493]  And they use crises over and over again to scare us into submission.
[00:49:11.913 --> 00:49:14.175]  And because the virus didn't make us bow.
[00:49:14.515 --> 00:49:16.737]  And because the fake global warming didn't make us bow.
[00:49:16.977 --> 00:49:18.838]  And cutting off the food didn't make us bow.
[00:49:19.119 --> 00:49:20.400]  And all the open borders... No!
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.622]  Now it's gonna be Islamic Jihad!
[00:49:24.143 --> 00:49:27.485]  Tomorrow's news today you just watch!
[00:49:28.846 --> 00:49:32.109]  And their plans to take us off the air so we can't tell you what's going on.
[00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:33.210]  So let me talk about that.
[00:49:34.534 --> 00:49:36.315]  We got incredible products you need right now.

[00:51:28.829 --> 00:51:29.429]  It's amazing.

[00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:18.736]  Alright, I'm gonna hit more news, more information, give the number out.
[00:52:19.037 --> 00:52:21.380]  Hour number two is coming up in two minutes.
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.303]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now!
[00:52:23.463 --> 00:52:23.703]  Now!
[00:52:23.843 --> 00:52:24.164]  Do it!
[00:52:24.404 --> 00:52:25.345]  You're the Paul Revere!
[00:52:25.405 --> 00:52:26.146]  You're the resistance!
[00:52:26.447 --> 00:52:27.729]  You are the unstoppable force!
[00:52:31.229 --> 00:52:32.849]  People don't tune in here for BS.
[00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:34.030]  Big Brother.
[00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:35.730]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:37.410]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:39.651]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:52:39.851 --> 00:52:40.991]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:41.531 --> 00:52:46.012]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:52:46.312 --> 00:52:47.872]  It's simple in the final equation.
[00:52:47.932 --> 00:52:48.352]  Complex.
[00:52:48.372 --> 00:52:50.173]  We can drill into all of it, but it just proves it all.
[00:52:50.193 --> 00:52:50.173]  100%.
[00:52:51.353 --> 00:52:53.273]  The globalist agenda's in trouble.
[00:52:53.293 --> 00:52:59.155]  I remember a few years ago, the EU had a bunch of states wanting to leave, and they said, if you leave, that'll mean war.
[00:52:59.755 --> 00:53:00.595]  Meaning they'll start a war.
[00:53:01.476 --> 00:53:02.316]  They'll start a war with Russia.
[00:53:02.336 --> 00:53:03.237]  They'll do whatever they have to.
[00:53:04.978 --> 00:53:07.219]  So, this is for first-time callers.
[00:53:09.781 --> 00:53:11.842]  Unless you're a former caller that's military.
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:25.243]  I also want to put at the head of the line anybody calling in from the Gaza Strip, anybody calling in from Israel, anybody calling in from the Golan Heights, anybody calling in from Syria, anybody calling in from the Middle East.
[00:53:25.263 --> 00:53:29.404]  In fact, maybe I should just at first only take calls to see if they can get through.
[00:53:29.665 --> 00:53:30.125]  Let's do that.
[00:53:30.205 --> 00:53:30.805]  I changed my mind.
[00:53:30.985 --> 00:53:31.385]  Live on air.
[00:53:31.405 --> 00:53:34.866]  We're going to open the phones up first.
[00:53:35.046 --> 00:53:36.226]  And callers, you're really good about this.
[00:53:36.306 --> 00:53:38.147]  Don't call in or they'll fill the lines up.
[00:53:39.602 --> 00:53:40.963]  We can't get to people that want to call in.
[00:53:41.583 --> 00:53:44.444]  The first round of calls, we'll probably just get three or four, I would imagine.
[00:53:45.384 --> 00:53:46.205]  That's usually what happens.
[00:53:46.405 --> 00:53:48.166]  I say, oh, an Australian caller's got three or four.
[00:53:48.506 --> 00:53:50.006]  Or I want German callers, two or three.
[00:53:50.046 --> 00:53:51.507]  Or I want British callers, full lines.
[00:53:51.527 --> 00:53:53.828]  I want Canadian callers, full lines, because the big audience is there.
[00:53:53.848 --> 00:53:56.789]  But Russian callers, one or two calls.
[00:53:56.849 --> 00:53:57.970]  French callers, a couple calls.
[00:53:58.110 --> 00:53:59.390]  Italian callers, Japanese callers.
[00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:00.311]  We get calls every time.
[00:54:03.612 --> 00:54:11.596]   I want to hear from people in the Middle East, people In Israel, people in what you call occupied Palestine.
[00:54:12.256 --> 00:54:13.376]  I want to hear from you.
[00:54:15.537 --> 00:54:15.838]  Okay?
[00:54:17.198 --> 00:54:18.559]  So call your country code and then 877-789-2539.
[00:54:18.579 --> 00:54:19.759]  Your country code and then 877-789-ALEX.
[00:54:19.579 --> 00:54:26.599]   7 8 9 2 5 3 9 your country code and then 8 7 7 7 8 9 Alex some phone systems
[00:54:26.599 --> 00:54:34.739]   overseas won't call a toll-free number so country code 5 1 2 6 4 6 17 76 country
[00:54:34.739 --> 00:54:48.109]   code 5 1 2 6 4 6 17 76 or 8 7 7 7 8 9 2 5 3 9 And I'll skip some of the breaks.
[00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:51.311]  I don't skip our local breaks for our stations, but I'll skip the network breaks.
[00:54:52.332 --> 00:54:53.433]  We lose money, but that's fine.
[00:54:53.453 --> 00:54:55.094]  At the end of the day, these shows are too important.
[00:54:55.434 --> 00:54:56.415]  Any show could be our last.
[00:54:56.455 --> 00:54:59.697]  I got the Globals breathing down my neck here, but I just, I know.
[00:54:59.717 --> 00:55:01.058]  I don't feel, I know.
[00:55:01.778 --> 00:55:03.920]  I've got a job to tell the truth about what's going on.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:12.726]  It isn't about being an Arab or a Jew or a German or a Christian or a Muslim or a Buddhist or a Hindu or an agnostic or gay or straight or black or white.
[00:55:12.766 --> 00:55:14.327]  It's about really studying it.
[00:55:14.407 --> 00:55:26.979]   And so somebody saying, The pieces of what's going on and you cannot, what hits me is you cannot deny that the West just aren't radical Islam or orthodox Islam.
[00:55:27.339 --> 00:55:29.161]  You can't deny they've given Iran all this.
[00:55:29.181 --> 00:55:30.702]  You can't deny they gave the Taliban all this.
[00:55:31.023 --> 00:55:32.664]  You can't deny Israel knew this was coming.
[00:55:32.944 --> 00:55:34.506]  You can't deny they gave all these U.S.
[00:55:34.526 --> 00:55:38.750]  weapons we see being used against the Israelis.
[00:55:39.671 --> 00:55:43.914]  You can't deny this will make Netanyahu more powerful, so he has the motive.
[00:55:44.534 --> 00:55:45.375]  You just can't deny it.
[00:55:45.395 --> 00:55:46.335]  People go, well, who's the villain?
[00:55:46.375 --> 00:55:47.356]  Ahmaud Arbery, Netanyahu.
[00:55:47.796 --> 00:55:49.037]  It's bigger than that, folks.
[00:55:49.077 --> 00:55:52.319]  You are being a slave if you continue to think about this.
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.841]  Who let the Islamists do this?
[00:55:54.881 --> 00:55:55.761]  They knew they were building up.
[00:55:55.601 --> 00:56:05.440]  out there's no way.
[00:56:04.887 --> 00:56:05.928]  Our criminal government.
[00:56:06.775 --> 00:56:12.238]  And I gotta say, I've seen CNN and MSNBC attack Netanyahu and say he stands to gain.
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:15.660]  Why did he let this happen?
[00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:17.361]  So maybe they control people in this government.
[00:56:17.781 --> 00:56:19.743]  We know half the government he doesn't control.
[00:56:20.003 --> 00:56:20.803]  I don't know.
[00:56:20.823 --> 00:56:22.004]  I don't know the specifics.
[00:56:22.724 --> 00:56:24.085]  That's why it has to be investigated.
[00:56:24.385 --> 00:56:25.346]  It has to be debated.
[00:56:25.646 --> 00:56:26.467]  It has to be discussed.
[00:56:26.487 --> 00:56:30.429]  But there are scores of former intelligence operatives from Israel.
[00:56:30.709 --> 00:56:48.949]  Who are well known, whose curricula vitae is known, who did work for these intelligence agencies, Israeli military intelligence, Shin Bet, Mossad, saying there is no way with the satellites and all the digital stuff that they capture, and their human intelligence on the ground, they didn't know this was going down.
[00:56:49.946 --> 00:56:51.987]  That is absolutely a fact.
[00:56:52.927 --> 00:56:56.088]  And notice they're saying, oh, it's the worst failure ever, they're incompetent.
[00:56:56.388 --> 00:56:57.529]  Well, then remove them from office.
[00:56:58.169 --> 00:56:59.689]  And I'm not saying even remove them from office.
[00:56:59.709 --> 00:57:03.771]  I'm saying, if that was the case, they would be removed for ineptitude.
[00:57:04.331 --> 00:57:05.571]  That didn't happen on 9-11 here.
[00:57:05.771 --> 00:57:11.774]  And when Hezbollah and Hamas attacked the United States and Europe, you watch, we'll lose freedoms, nothing will happen to them.
[00:57:12.014 --> 00:57:14.414]  Yeah, the fighters giving suicide money, they'll all be dead.
[00:57:14.735 --> 00:57:15.515]  They're just giving orders.
[00:57:15.815 --> 00:57:16.915]  But who's giving the orders?
[00:57:17.175 --> 00:57:18.336]  I'm sick of this crap!
[00:57:19.036 --> 00:57:19.596]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:19.616 --> 00:57:23.277]  Stay with us.
[00:57:23.857 --> 00:57:27.899]  The last beacon of truth in a world of deception, it's Alex Jones.
[00:57:27.939 --> 00:57:31.279]  All right, listen.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.080]  It's the middle of the night in the Middle East.
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.281]  I had said we're just going to take calls from the Middle East.
[00:57:37.221 --> 00:57:39.222]  And normally we do that on my weekday show.
[00:57:39.242 --> 00:57:40.482]  We get it because it's nighttime over there.
[00:57:40.522 --> 00:57:41.422]  It's the middle of the night now.
[00:57:42.323 --> 00:57:44.123]  And if you call in from the Middle East, you go to the other line.
[00:57:44.143 --> 00:57:46.864]  But we're going to open the phones up just for callers in general.
[00:57:48.772 --> 00:57:50.335]  You heard my analysis the last hour.
[00:57:50.956 --> 00:57:56.446]  What we broke down, the clear Israeli stand down, $7 billion given to the Taliban of U.S.
[00:57:56.486 --> 00:57:58.590]  weapons, $6 billion last month to Iran.
[00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:00.373]  Iran now bragging they're behind the attacks.
[00:58:02.048 --> 00:58:03.889]  All these Islamists being allowed over our borders.
[00:58:03.969 --> 00:58:05.490]  Where do you think this is all going?
[00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:06.771]  What do you make of what I've said?
[00:58:06.811 --> 00:58:07.711]  What's your take on it?
[00:58:07.751 --> 00:58:08.351]  What's your view?
[00:58:08.652 --> 00:58:09.812]  Open phones for everybody.
[00:58:10.172 --> 00:58:11.153]  First time callers though.
[00:58:11.173 --> 00:58:11.273]  877-789-2539.
[00:58:11.293 --> 00:58:11.593]  877-789-Alex.
[00:58:11.413 --> 00:58:16.413]  877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[00:58:16.413 --> 00:58:26.213]   And if your country code won't work with a toll free number, country code dialed
[00:58:26.213 --> 00:58:31.213]  and 512-646-1776.
[00:58:31.213 --> 00:58:38.771]   And we will go to your calls here on this live Sunday broadcast.
[00:58:38.775 --> 00:58:40.557]  But this is a big deal.
[00:58:40.577 --> 00:58:42.078]  You can say, I don't care about Israel.
[00:58:42.178 --> 00:58:43.540]  I don't care about the Palestinians.
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:44.761]  I'm sick of it.
[00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:46.022]  I'm tired of it going on.
[00:58:46.562 --> 00:58:47.503]  I'm tired of these wars.
[00:58:47.563 --> 00:58:47.984]  So am I.
[00:58:48.746 --> 00:58:58.969]  But the fact that the Western government's empowered and funded all of this is a big, big deal that needs to be discussed.
[00:58:59.929 --> 00:59:01.729]  And we need to talk about it.
[00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:08.631]  And we need to focus on it because the war has exploded in Eastern Europe on the border of Russia.
[00:59:09.652 --> 00:59:10.512]  Central Eastern Europe.
[00:59:13.232 --> 00:59:14.873]  China's moving against Taiwan.
[00:59:16.411 --> 00:59:17.591]  Now this is exploding there.
[00:59:17.951 --> 00:59:21.612]  Why would our government pull out and give $7 million to the Taliban of weapons?
[00:59:22.073 --> 00:59:28.394]  Why would Obama, Biden, give all that money to Hezbollah and the Iranians?
[00:59:31.935 --> 00:59:33.196]  What's the master plan?
[00:59:33.576 --> 00:59:34.576]  Where is this going?
[00:59:35.236 --> 00:59:37.017]  It strengthens the military-industrial complex.
[00:59:37.337 --> 00:59:40.658]  It strengthens all these governments taking our rights and our freedoms.
[00:59:41.687 --> 00:59:44.588]  What should be done about it?
[00:59:44.608 --> 00:59:45.389]  877-789-2539.
[00:59:45.809 --> 00:59:48.390]  We got loaded phone lines.
[00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:52.271]  We got to go through and get your name and get ready to go to you and where you're calling from.
[00:59:52.291 --> 00:59:55.032]  So we're going to be going to you here in just a few minutes.
[00:59:55.112 --> 01:00:13.216]   But it was Obama that funded the Arab Spring with billions of dollars, hundreds of millions to Egypt to overthrow our ally and put jihadis in that blew up churches by the hundreds and set up a police state and the Egyptians were able to remove that Western coup.
[01:00:13.656 --> 01:00:18.821]  Why are Western governments removing secular governments and putting in Islamic dictatorships?
[01:00:19.822 --> 01:00:21.243]  That's the larger plan.
[01:00:21.363 --> 01:00:23.845]  Why is that happening?
[01:00:26.527 --> 01:00:30.826]   Hamas surprise attack, historic failure for Israel, intelligence services got right.
[01:00:30.826 --> 01:00:38.766]   And then you have all the dramatic footage of what's happened and the Israelis are still trying
[01:00:38.766 --> 01:00:44.885]   to repel and kick out the tens of thousands of suicide troops funded by Hamas through Hezbollah
[01:00:44.885 --> 01:00:45.967]  that have poured in.
[01:00:45.967 --> 01:00:50.287]  Israel's having attacks in the north as well.
[01:00:50.287 --> 01:00:53.807]  This whole thing is breaking down very, very quickly.
[01:00:53.807 --> 01:00:55.007]  And here's the headline.
[01:00:55.007 --> 01:00:57.007]  U.S.
[01:00:56.234 --> 01:01:01.055]  left behind $7 million of military equipment in Afghanistan over 2021, withdrew.
[01:01:01.095 --> 01:01:05.536]  Pentagon report says at least $7 billion.
[01:01:05.836 --> 01:01:07.977]  And we've got this whole angle.
[01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:09.157]  We're being slaughtered.
[01:01:09.197 --> 01:01:10.117]  Israelis cry for help.
[01:01:10.177 --> 01:01:11.317]  It's Hamas militants breaking their homes.
[01:01:11.618 --> 01:01:13.058]  Turns out most of them weren't armed.
[01:01:13.078 --> 01:01:16.679]  A lot of these are liberals from around the world, people that never owned guns.
[01:01:16.819 --> 01:01:17.759]  Russia, the U.S.
[01:01:17.819 --> 01:01:18.319]  moving there.
[01:01:19.039 --> 01:01:32.606]   What are you doing just a mile away from two and a half million people In the Golan Heights in the north or in the Gaza Strip in the south that want to kill you and you don't own a gun.
[01:01:33.887 --> 01:01:36.668]  Horrible images of people being kidnapped, being drug away.
[01:01:37.449 --> 01:01:40.750]  This is the reality of what is unfolding.
[01:01:41.671 --> 01:01:48.955]  Meanwhile we have Democrat, Socialist of America host rally in Times Square in support of Hamas attacks in Israel.
[01:01:50.452 --> 01:01:53.034]  And then we still have some debate about whether Iran is involved.
[01:01:53.094 --> 01:01:54.775]  Iran has the real organizational skill.
[01:01:54.815 --> 01:01:57.678]  They're bragging they were quarterbacking the operation.
[01:01:57.778 --> 01:02:02.161]  They're quarterbacking bringing the infiltrators, the sleeper cells, across our open border.
[01:02:02.441 --> 01:02:05.103]  Thousands a week, according to the Border Patrol.
[01:02:05.424 --> 01:02:12.789]  Always a month, tens of thousands of Islamic military men from the Middle East coming in to the United States.
[01:02:15.452 --> 01:02:15.752]  Okay.
[01:02:17.179 --> 01:02:19.160]  We're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:02:19.441 --> 01:02:20.642]  Anonymous is in FEMA Region 5.
[01:02:20.682 --> 01:02:21.662]  We'll go to you in a moment.
[01:02:22.123 --> 01:02:23.924]  Martin, California, we'll go to you as well.
[01:02:24.985 --> 01:02:28.988]  But first, Tove in Ontario has relatives in the Israeli Defense Force.
[01:02:29.408 --> 01:02:32.871]  What are you hearing from your relatives in the Israeli military?
[01:02:33.971 --> 01:02:43.879]  Well, my sister, actually, Alex, was in the IDF during the first Gulf War, and she's in contact with people there, and they said it's way worse.
[01:02:46.161 --> 01:02:55.267]  People are being slaughtered and a lot of them still believe that it was a surprise attack.
[01:02:55.727 --> 01:02:58.348]  When I saw it, I knew it was BS.
[01:02:58.428 --> 01:02:59.549]  I could tell.
[01:02:59.569 --> 01:03:05.693]  I could tell that Biden, when he was talking about it, he normally says, use restraint, right?
[01:03:06.113 --> 01:03:07.994]  This time he's all for the war.
[01:03:08.014 --> 01:03:10.736]  I believe this is going to escalate.
[01:03:10.836 --> 01:03:12.337]  They're going to go after Iran.
[01:03:12.357 --> 01:03:18.061]   And this is the beginning or This is gonna head to World War III.
[01:03:19.823 --> 01:03:32.794]  Well, you know in the 70s, Israel founded Hamas to be a counterbalance to Iran, but now it basically works with Iran, so I think it's hard to tell what's currently happening, but absolutely, Israel is one of the most high-tech countries in the world.
[01:03:33.294 --> 01:03:39.159]  Massive electronic surveillance, massive human intelligence, massive research going on.
[01:03:39.559 --> 01:03:42.282]  How could they not know this was building up right on their border?
[01:03:43.206 --> 01:03:45.587]  They absolutely knew it was building up.
[01:03:45.627 --> 01:03:47.008]  They just kept it quiet.
[01:03:47.188 --> 01:03:48.689]  I believe they facilitated it.
[01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:55.632]  As both of us know, as all the InfoWarriors know, that this goes way above the government.
[01:03:56.612 --> 01:04:03.056]  This is their need to usher in, like you said, the surveillance state, or burn us all down.
[01:04:03.116 --> 01:04:10.039]  There's nothing that's going to be more effective to get rid of 90% of the population than a thermonuclear war, right?
[01:04:11.596 --> 01:04:12.117]  Absolutely.
[01:04:12.137 --> 01:04:13.197]  Any other observations?
[01:04:15.479 --> 01:04:25.727]  Well, I just want people to wake up and not buy into this, you know, that it was an organic, you know, spontaneous attack.
[01:04:26.168 --> 01:04:27.549]  Here's another point I've got.
[01:04:28.029 --> 01:04:32.112]  My mother and I went to go see a movie called Golda about a month ago.
[01:04:33.353 --> 01:04:36.035]  And that was about the 73 war.
[01:04:36.316 --> 01:04:38.738]  And again, they said it was a big surprise.
[01:04:40.066 --> 01:04:43.579]  But the whole idea of that, I believe, was sort of a predictive program.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:53.025]  Absolutely, because it turned out with that war, and also with Pearl Harbor that I was comparing it to, they knew.
[01:04:53.085 --> 01:04:55.606]  The Israelis knew, and we're not saying the Arabs are good because they did it.
[01:04:55.947 --> 01:05:03.312]  We're just simply saying, Israel knew about that, it came out, and that's when they were ready, and so did the U.S.
[01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:04.032]  during Pearl Harbor.
[01:05:04.072 --> 01:05:07.815]  We're not defending the Japanese doing it, we're just saying, our government knew that!
[01:05:07.935 --> 01:05:10.136]  So, they're pretty damn guilty, aren't they?
[01:05:11.037 --> 01:05:12.738]  Well, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:05:12.818 --> 01:05:17.846]   And the other thing was, Watching the, you know, the Fried Fox News or any of them.
[01:05:18.146 --> 01:05:22.488]  They talked about how a drone dropped a grenade into a Merkava tank.
[01:05:23.288 --> 01:05:25.910]  Come on, like, this didn't happen before.
[01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:26.850]  This is setup.
[01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:28.291]  This is all setup.
[01:05:29.051 --> 01:05:34.954]  I was about to say, since when did the Israelis leave a bunch of tanks and aircraft and weapons just laying around with nobody guarding them?
[01:05:35.879 --> 01:05:37.419]  No, no, this was planted.
[01:05:37.459 --> 01:05:39.180]  This was absolutely planted.
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:41.240]  This whole thing staked to high heaven.
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:43.400]  And again, we're not saying the average soldier was involved.
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:44.561]  They just give them different orders.
[01:05:45.701 --> 01:05:46.301]  No, no.
[01:05:46.441 --> 01:05:54.362]  And the fact, if you look at Netanyahu, if you look at, you even said this, 9-11, I'm older now, I'm older than you.
[01:05:54.882 --> 01:06:03.104]  I remember him being on TV when they asked about 9-11, he starts saying, oh no, it was a good thing, no, no, no, it was, no, no, no, I mean it was really bad.
[01:06:03.184 --> 01:06:09.459]   And then the whole thing with the shot, They're into this globalist or whoever knows really deep.
[01:06:09.739 --> 01:06:10.860]  They want this so bad.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.062]  All right, thank you, Tove.
[01:06:13.082 --> 01:06:16.605]  All right, we're going to go to more calls when we come back.
[01:06:16.625 --> 01:06:18.987]  We're going to go quickly to your calls when we return.
[01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:28.034]  We're going to go to Anonymous and FEMA Region 5 on Islamic assassins, which we know are being brought into the U.S., Canada, and Europe.
[01:06:29.141 --> 01:06:31.083]  And of course, the government won't get in trouble if they let him attack us.
[01:06:31.103 --> 01:06:31.784]  They'll get more power.
[01:06:32.465 --> 01:06:33.647]  That's really the big takeaway here.
[01:06:34.127 --> 01:06:40.395]  And then we'll go to Mark, and we'll go to Steve, and we'll go to James, and Jordan, and Ferris, and everybody else.
[01:06:40.475 --> 01:06:42.157]  I'm going to go bam, bam, bam.
[01:06:42.778 --> 01:06:43.438]  We're not going to skip.
[01:06:44.397 --> 01:06:46.478]  The break happens, but we'll skip the last break of the hour.
[01:06:46.938 --> 01:06:53.259]  And then we've got Sunday Live, two hours live as well, 6 to 8 p.m., with only six minutes of ads an hour.
[01:06:53.279 --> 01:06:56.200]  You can take your phone calls and give analysis as well.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:00.821]  We've still got two hours and 45 minutes left tonight.
[01:07:01.222 --> 01:07:02.742]  The truth's getting talked about here.
[01:07:03.242 --> 01:07:04.442]  So everybody you know, tune in now.
[01:07:04.482 --> 01:07:05.443]  That's how we reach new people.
[01:07:05.683 --> 01:07:06.263]  We'll be right back.
[01:07:06.283 --> 01:07:06.643]  Stay with us.
[01:07:08.704 --> 01:07:12.105]  All right, we're going to Jordan and California and moving through your calls quickly.
[01:07:12.125 --> 01:07:13.545]  This just broke Associated Press.
[01:07:14.338 --> 01:07:14.598]  The U.S.
[01:07:14.618 --> 01:07:26.143]  will send a carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean in support of Israel, obviously for potential attack on Iran, or perhaps even into the Palestinian-held areas.
[01:07:27.284 --> 01:07:28.804]  So a lot of big developments happening fast.
[01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:31.446]  Jordan in California, you were in Israel last month.
[01:07:31.466 --> 01:07:32.826]  Jordan, give us your observations.
[01:07:33.907 --> 01:07:35.527]  Hi Alex, first-time caller.
[01:07:36.528 --> 01:07:43.531]  I was there with a prominent group with a private tour, and I noticed a lot of breaches.
[01:07:45.976 --> 01:07:49.256]  And a lot of laxed attitudes about the Arabs.
[01:07:50.157 --> 01:07:51.377]  And I saw a lot of weakness.
[01:07:51.517 --> 01:07:56.779]  And I asked about the nuclear power station in Tel Aviv.
[01:07:56.859 --> 01:07:58.699]  I said, how come it's not surrounded?
[01:07:58.719 --> 01:07:59.880]  How come it's not protected?
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:02.800]  It just seemed like it was very exposed.
[01:08:03.421 --> 01:08:09.902]  And one of the security officers told me they were very disappointed that there's this woke attitude in Israel.
[01:08:10.743 --> 01:08:14.565]   These liberal Jews Their kids are in the army and they're very weak.
[01:08:15.426 --> 01:08:17.967]  They're not the same kind of soldiers that they had in the 70s.
[01:08:19.068 --> 01:08:21.609]  These are, you know, it's a different breed of Israeli soldiers.
[01:08:21.629 --> 01:08:23.230]  Well, yeah, it's the same problem everywhere.
[01:08:24.170 --> 01:08:25.931]  Yeah, well, it was very apparent there.
[01:08:26.512 --> 01:08:32.775]  And I have a friend in a bunker right now and she told me there's literally raping going on in the street.
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:36.722]  Oh, that's all confirmed and it's much worse than the media is saying.
[01:08:36.742 --> 01:08:37.502]  That's all confirmed.
[01:08:37.522 --> 01:08:39.423]  Tens of thousands have taken over large areas.
[01:08:40.104 --> 01:08:41.965]  You heard me give a wide spectrum analysis.
[01:08:42.005 --> 01:08:42.545]  What do you think?
[01:08:44.086 --> 01:08:50.970]  I think the Chinese are involved because they control the ports there and they've got interest in all the high technology.
[01:08:51.431 --> 01:08:52.932]  Israel kind of sold out to China.
[01:08:53.892 --> 01:08:56.674]  And China controls Iran and even controls Russia.
[01:08:57.532 --> 01:09:01.154]  So I think they're behind all this as well.
[01:09:01.975 --> 01:09:02.435]  Absolutely.
[01:09:02.455 --> 01:09:03.575]  China's the big mover here.
[01:09:04.076 --> 01:09:09.999]  And then why do you think Biden, who's controlled by China, and his son is giving all these weapons to the Islamists?
[01:09:10.019 --> 01:09:13.601]  I mean, he should be impeached right now.
[01:09:15.702 --> 01:09:16.082]  Absolutely.
[01:09:16.102 --> 01:09:18.103]  And also, Alex, I thought it was $86 billion.
[01:09:21.676 --> 01:09:22.416]  No, I agree.
[01:09:22.677 --> 01:09:26.480]  It's at least, the infrastructure, all of it that we built, they're saying is $80 billion.
[01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:27.862]  No, no, no.
[01:09:27.882 --> 01:09:29.203]  CNN's number is $7 billion.
[01:09:29.323 --> 01:09:30.284]  I agree, it's much higher.
[01:09:31.065 --> 01:09:31.685]  Go ahead.
[01:09:31.705 --> 01:09:32.446]  $86 billion.
[01:09:34.168 --> 01:09:43.416]   And that's all being, that's all coming down in there and how Hamas There's no way they did this without anybody.
[01:09:43.516 --> 01:09:46.918]  I mean, I study it because it's so interesting, but you sound like you know a lot too.
[01:09:47.918 --> 01:09:49.659]  The Arabs on average are not that organized.
[01:09:50.159 --> 01:09:51.100]  The Iranians are.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.401]  This looked Iranian the minute I saw it.
[01:09:54.161 --> 01:10:02.686]  The other thing is, if you look at who's actually coming across those wires, those aren't necessarily, they're not Palestinians.
[01:10:03.146 --> 01:10:04.247]  Those were Egyptians.
[01:10:05.107 --> 01:10:05.867]  They have afros.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.101]  Those are not... I saw that.
[01:10:10.121 --> 01:10:12.082]  A lot of the people taking hostages were black.
[01:10:12.882 --> 01:10:13.362]  They're black.
[01:10:13.382 --> 01:10:14.703]  They have afros.
[01:10:15.603 --> 01:10:16.664]  That's who they sent in.
[01:10:17.084 --> 01:10:23.567]  And those planes, the glide planes, they don't have those there.
[01:10:23.647 --> 01:10:25.888]  I mean, those are... You never see those in Israel.
[01:10:29.235 --> 01:10:39.419]  So I just don't know how this whole thing got away from everybody, but the average Israeli trooper there, they're liberal Jews and they're weak, unfortunately.
[01:10:39.459 --> 01:10:40.279]  And I'm a Zionist.
[01:10:40.339 --> 01:10:40.799]  I'm a Jew.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:49.142]  And, you know, I remember we had tank commanders stay at our house during the 1973 war.
[01:10:49.923 --> 01:10:55.545]  Our family bought a tank and we had the tank crew stay at our house one summer.
[01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:56.285]  We got to meet them.
[01:10:57.145 --> 01:10:58.606]  And these were tough guys.
[01:10:58.826 --> 01:11:00.007]  Tough, tough guys.
[01:11:00.527 --> 01:11:02.168]  I was 10 years old, 11 years old.
[01:11:03.028 --> 01:11:09.031]  And the soldiers you see now, they're... And it's also Sodom and Gomorrah.
[01:11:09.491 --> 01:11:11.452]  It's also Sodom and Gomorrah over there.
[01:11:11.912 --> 01:11:12.573]  A rave?
[01:11:13.573 --> 01:11:14.754]  That's unbelievable.
[01:11:15.054 --> 01:11:22.698]  Well, is that not biblical to have men coming down in empowered hang gliders attacking and killing people while the Israelis party?
[01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:24.308]  Absolutely.
[01:11:24.988 --> 01:11:26.069]  I'm just in shock.
[01:11:26.589 --> 01:11:29.051]  And I have a lot of friends and family... But I mean, look at the message.
[01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:31.894]  On the, quote, Sabbath, or church day, they're out there partying.
[01:11:33.155 --> 01:11:33.995]  It's unbelievable.
[01:11:34.175 --> 01:11:35.236]  It's Sodom and Gomorrah.
[01:11:35.256 --> 01:11:36.477]  And my friends here in L.A.
[01:11:36.917 --> 01:11:42.162]  were disgusted with these Jews, with these liberal Jews, that all they want to do is shake their ass and party.
[01:11:43.923 --> 01:11:44.764]  And they're weak.
[01:11:45.224 --> 01:11:45.704]  They're weak.
[01:11:46.085 --> 01:11:48.587]  And you can't be surrounded by enemies like this and be weak.
[01:11:49.207 --> 01:11:52.770]  And those parents that were tough raised weak children.
[01:11:53.783 --> 01:11:54.023]  All right.
[01:11:54.063 --> 01:11:55.624]  Thank you for the call, Jordan.
[01:11:55.684 --> 01:11:57.005]  Very powerful information.
[01:11:57.025 --> 01:11:58.006]  We've got to move quickly, everybody.
[01:11:58.306 --> 01:11:59.827]  By the way, Owen's coming in the next few hours.
[01:11:59.907 --> 01:12:01.588]  Everybody that's on hold then, we'll get to you.
[01:12:01.608 --> 01:12:03.409]  But I think we'll get to all these callers before that happens.
[01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:06.991]  For everybody else that calls in after these callers, you'll be on with Owen tonight.
[01:12:07.071 --> 01:12:07.992]  Huge audience tonight.
[01:12:08.412 --> 01:12:09.813]  Obviously, this is very dangerous.
[01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:11.234]  Who's up next here?
[01:12:11.254 --> 01:12:12.014]  Who's next in order?
[01:12:13.815 --> 01:12:14.776]  Guys, tell me who's next here.
[01:12:15.016 --> 01:12:15.816]  I've got to get glasses.
[01:12:15.856 --> 01:12:16.597]  My eyes are going out.
[01:12:17.878 --> 01:12:19.038]  Mark in California.
[01:12:19.058 --> 01:12:19.599]  You're on the air.
[01:12:19.659 --> 01:12:20.259]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:21.880]  Hi, Alex.
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:22.700]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:12:22.861 --> 01:12:23.141]  Yes, sir.
[01:12:23.181 --> 01:12:23.381]  Go ahead.
[01:12:24.332 --> 01:12:27.795]  Yes, I would like to just plug the iodine.
[01:12:27.875 --> 01:12:31.018]  My wife is having inflammation issues, and it's really helped, so thank you for that.
[01:12:31.038 --> 01:12:33.880]  So I want to talk about Revelation Chapter 12.
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.822]  It's Bible prophecy being fulfilled.
[01:12:37.783 --> 01:12:47.811]  It says, war broke out in heaven, and Michael and his angels went forth to battle with the dragon, which could be interpreted as China, because they, you know, use the dragon in their symbology.
[01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:53.316]  And the angels fought, and the huge dragon was cast down, and the angel serpent is called the Devil and Satan.
[01:12:54.005 --> 01:12:59.226]  I'm skipping several verses because I don't want to take too much time.
[01:12:59.726 --> 01:13:15.830]  But then he goes after the believers and it says, "...and they have overcome by the means of the blood of the Lamb and by the utterance of their testimony, for they did not love and cling to life, even when faced with death, and holding their lives cheap, till they had to die for the witnessing."
[01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:18.071]  So this is an all-out attack against Jews and Christians.
[01:13:18.464 --> 01:13:26.148]  With the FBI calling terrorists, most of them are Christians, and this attack, there was a false flag by our own government against Israelis.
[01:13:26.428 --> 01:13:27.589]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[01:13:27.609 --> 01:13:28.409]  We're going to move quick now.
[01:13:28.849 --> 01:13:31.190]  Anonymous in FEMA Region 5, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:13:31.210 --> 01:13:34.212]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:13:34.752 --> 01:13:35.012]  Go ahead.
[01:13:36.773 --> 01:13:44.217]  So the Islamic Assassins, that's one of the oldest secret societies in the world, going back to the first Crusades, when the Templars took Jerusalem.
[01:13:45.209 --> 01:13:54.800]  And the assassins, Leo Sagami did a good episode on drugs and the Illuminati and they brainwashed their members with cannabis and all sorts of drugs like today.
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:58.204]  They operate the same way today, creating the perfect suicide.
[01:13:58.385 --> 01:13:58.805]  No, you're right.
[01:13:58.845 --> 01:14:00.948]  A lot of these Islamist fighters are on a bunch of drugs.
[01:14:02.782 --> 01:14:03.583]  Yep, exactly.
[01:14:03.603 --> 01:14:06.065]  And I agree with your wide-spectrum analysis.
[01:14:06.145 --> 01:14:13.430]  I just want to add that the Vatican and Jesuit Pope Francis put in place a cardinal in Jerusalem a few days before this all happened.
[01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:16.292]  His name is Cardinal Pizza Pala.
[01:14:16.312 --> 01:14:18.454]  It's an Italian name.
[01:14:18.474 --> 01:14:19.995]  He's the knight of the Holy Sepulchre, too.
[01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:21.516]  We'll look into that.
[01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:21.977]  Thank you.
[01:14:22.017 --> 01:14:22.918]  Paul in Florida.
[01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:24.559]  Palestinians protesting in Florida.
[01:14:24.859 --> 01:14:25.199]  Go ahead.
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:27.001]  Hi.
[01:14:27.201 --> 01:14:28.682]  Hey, Alex.
[01:14:29.182 --> 01:14:31.664]  I just wanted to talk about a couple of things real quick.
[01:14:31.704 --> 01:14:41.664]   Number one, The explosively formed penetrator that killed that Israeli tank, if that's real, that's a major problem.
[01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:52.611]  Number two, I just saw about 350 Palestinian protesters clashing with Israeli protesters in Tampa, Florida.
[01:14:52.711 --> 01:14:53.232]  I didn't know that.
[01:14:53.252 --> 01:14:56.214]  Guys, look up, protest Florida Palestinians.
[01:14:56.574 --> 01:14:57.795]  Wow, they just clashed with them.
[01:14:59.979 --> 01:15:01.219]  Well, they were about to.
[01:15:01.359 --> 01:15:03.180]  It's on my Facebook page.
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:04.720]  I just uploaded it.
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:05.800]  Okay, what's your Facebook?
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:06.540]  What's your Facebook?
[01:15:07.601 --> 01:15:09.341]  It's Doug Schnutzke.
[01:15:11.041 --> 01:15:14.722]  D-O-U-G-S-C-H-N-U-S-K-E.
[01:15:15.042 --> 01:15:16.102]  Doug Schnutzke.
[01:15:17.062 --> 01:15:18.623]  And where do they clash with him?
[01:15:18.663 --> 01:15:21.123]  Where do they clash with him in Florida?
[01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:22.183]  Right in Tampa.
[01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:24.584]  I just moved here from Connecticut.
[01:15:25.393 --> 01:15:28.114]  Hold on, I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:15:28.194 --> 01:15:32.617]  Tell the crew, because I missed part of it, where we find this, and we'll pull it up next segment.
[01:15:32.917 --> 01:15:33.697]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:15:33.717 --> 01:15:35.098]  Stay with us at fullwars.com.
[01:15:35.518 --> 01:15:36.618]  Banned out video.
[01:15:36.438 --> 01:15:38.438]  All the whole world's on fire.
[01:15:38.438 --> 01:15:41.398]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:15:41.398 --> 01:15:56.238]   Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.

[01:16:18.938 --> 01:16:20.697]  (upbeat music)
[01:16:20.794 --> 01:16:23.536]  The situation in Israel is a lot bigger than just Israel.
[01:16:24.196 --> 01:16:26.518]  China's moving in on the South China Sea and Taiwan.
[01:16:26.538 --> 01:16:28.299]  They're moving in all over the place.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.661]  Our borders are wide open, but totally infiltrated.
[01:16:31.481 --> 01:16:33.403]  You've got the insanity going on in Ukraine.
[01:16:34.303 --> 01:16:35.664]  This is the season of destruction.
[01:16:36.245 --> 01:16:37.085]  Now U.S.
[01:16:37.145 --> 01:16:39.507]  aircraft carrier strike groups moving into the area.
[01:16:41.248 --> 01:16:44.210]  War is already exploded.
[01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:47.212]  It's much worse than what you're hearing on the news in Israel.
[01:16:48.253 --> 01:16:49.134]  This is a big deal.
[01:16:50.296 --> 01:16:50.656]  All right.
[01:16:51.757 --> 01:16:54.560]  Were you guys able to get to Paul's Facebook page?
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:17:00.986]  Because we were talking to Paul, and he said he was just in Tampa and saw a bunch of Palestinians and Jews clashing.
[01:17:01.567 --> 01:17:02.748]  Yeah, here's the footage right here.
[01:17:02.808 --> 01:17:03.809]  So yeah, this is going on.
[01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:06.251]  And so thank you, Paul, for that tip.
[01:17:06.972 --> 01:17:12.075]  We'll get that video and air it coming up next hour with Owen Schroer.
[01:17:12.095 --> 01:17:13.555]  Make a note for Owen to air that.
[01:17:14.136 --> 01:17:17.717]  This is powerful stuff, but I want to be able to get to your phone calls right now.
[01:17:17.737 --> 01:17:18.538]  We got the New York footage.
[01:17:18.558 --> 01:17:19.598]  We can B-roll all that.
[01:17:20.239 --> 01:17:20.779]  And what's going on?
[01:17:20.799 --> 01:17:21.559]  This is powerful.
[01:17:21.599 --> 01:17:22.500]  Thanks for the tip, sir.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:23.360]  Thank you, Paul.
[01:17:24.441 --> 01:17:27.562]  Owen will air that coming up start of the next hour.
[01:17:28.563 --> 01:17:28.963]  Okay.
[01:17:29.463 --> 01:17:30.063]  Write a note, guys.
[01:17:30.083 --> 01:17:30.564]  We're going to do that.
[01:17:30.604 --> 01:17:31.384]  Total losers we are.
[01:17:32.164 --> 01:17:36.279]   Let's go to Steve in South Carolina.
[01:17:36.559 --> 01:17:37.139]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:17:37.159 --> 01:17:37.619]  You're on the air.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:39.760]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:17:40.801 --> 01:17:41.561]  Three words.
[01:17:42.322 --> 01:17:42.922]  Problem.
[01:17:43.182 --> 01:17:43.862]  Reaction.
[01:17:44.102 --> 01:17:44.783]  Solution.
[01:17:45.323 --> 01:17:47.244]  Quoted from your friend David Icke.
[01:17:47.964 --> 01:17:53.427]  They create the problem, they get the reaction, and then they come in as the saviors.
[01:17:54.387 --> 01:18:01.050]  This is a total distraction from the destruction that Russia is wreaking on NATO.
[01:18:01.471 --> 01:18:05.834]   My gosh, there's been, what, 400,000 Ukrainians killed.
[01:18:07.855 --> 01:18:10.777]  And it's, this is good against evil.
[01:18:11.637 --> 01:18:20.742]  Your 100% analysis is right, correct, to the T. I mean, they're, they're leading us into total destruction.
[01:18:21.503 --> 01:18:44.417]   And if everybody would just go read Revelation 18 over and over and over, or in one hour as thy judgment come, or in one hour as she may desolate, desolate, And my interpretation of this chapter is we're going to see New York burn to the ground.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:48.380]  I agree with you.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.381]  We're rolling some footage, a little bit of audio while you talk.
[01:18:50.401 --> 01:18:50.842]  Keep going.
[01:18:51.242 --> 01:18:53.564]  I mean, look, our government has opened us up for this.
[01:18:54.024 --> 01:18:57.807]  Thousands a week coming across the Texas border are military age men from the Middle East.
[01:18:58.087 --> 01:19:00.089]  That is in the Border Patrol reports.
[01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:01.790]  Yes.
[01:19:02.814 --> 01:19:05.076]  And China's coming over.
[01:19:05.176 --> 01:19:11.201]  Michael Yan has reported 50, 100 Chinese nationals coming over a day.
[01:19:11.221 --> 01:19:14.144]  We don't know who these people are.
[01:19:14.945 --> 01:19:18.848]  And I mean, we're pretty much screwed.
[01:19:19.878 --> 01:19:21.579]  And people, I'll say this.
[01:19:21.619 --> 01:19:24.381]  Defunding of the police, incredible crime exploding.
[01:19:24.761 --> 01:19:27.183]  It's all part of the, you don't know what angle hit you.
[01:19:27.523 --> 01:19:28.824]  Millions dying from the shots.
[01:19:28.884 --> 01:19:29.885]  Yeah, this is the New World Order.
[01:19:30.185 --> 01:19:31.686]  This is the post-industrial world.
[01:19:32.046 --> 01:19:32.887]  An angrier world.
[01:19:33.007 --> 01:19:33.867]  Wreck society.
[01:19:33.927 --> 01:19:34.608]  Tear it down.
[01:19:34.968 --> 01:19:35.609]  Break it down.
[01:19:35.929 --> 01:19:37.390]  They're using every angle they can.
[01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:39.611]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:40.212 --> 01:19:44.174]  And, you know, people just, they've got to get back to the word of God.
[01:19:44.775 --> 01:19:48.057]  There's Steve Quayle, how many times you had him on say?
[01:19:48.666 --> 01:19:53.708]  There is no political solution to a spiritual problem.
[01:19:54.128 --> 01:19:55.829]  We've got to get back to God.
[01:19:56.169 --> 01:19:59.011]  I pray for you and the InfoWars crew every day.
[01:20:00.431 --> 01:20:10.195]  People, we've got to get ready because, in my honestly humble opinion, I'm excited because we may be able to see Jesus Christ.
[01:20:10.215 --> 01:20:22.533]   I mean, that's exciting, but all of this death, all of this killing, all of this hate, You know, I don't know.
[01:20:23.753 --> 01:20:26.053]  I'll say this, brother, and I appreciate your call, Steve.
[01:20:26.513 --> 01:20:30.854]  When I see this footage of North Africans, it was a large part of the group invading.
[01:20:31.234 --> 01:20:33.494]  They got paid hundreds of thousands apiece by Hezbollah.
[01:20:33.534 --> 01:20:37.075]  It's all coming out by Iran to come there and risk their lives to do this.
[01:20:37.095 --> 01:20:37.955]  They were given bounties.
[01:20:38.535 --> 01:20:44.936]  That's what the main security fence in the Gaza Strip is, is to stop the quote, African migrants that also use it coming in.
[01:20:45.516 --> 01:20:48.257]  And so they brought in Islamists out of Libya, other places.
[01:20:48.837 --> 01:20:50.118]  It's always been about globalism.
[01:20:50.418 --> 01:20:55.858]   the Islamists that weren't under globalist control and they're now using them to bring
[01:20:55.858 --> 01:21:01.218]   them in. That is the bottom line. Thank you Steve. All right let's take calls the order received.
[01:21:01.218 --> 01:21:05.937]   Steve in Tennessee says what's the goal? What is the goal Steve? Or what is the goal James?
[01:21:05.937 --> 01:21:14.898]   It's always been about globalism. I'm 28 years old. I've watched nothing my entire life but the
[01:21:14.898 --> 01:21:19.538]   rise of the police state and globalism and they're all coming for us.
[01:21:19.798 --> 01:21:24.983]  No matter who we are, no matter how small you are, no matter how poor you are, rich you are, it doesn't matter.
[01:21:25.043 --> 01:21:26.384]  They're all coming after us, sir.
[01:21:28.285 --> 01:21:28.666]  I agree.
[01:21:28.746 --> 01:21:29.566]  I mean, look, look, look.
[01:21:30.518 --> 01:21:32.079]  Oh, Biden has to be impeached now.
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:37.483]  He gave them the tens of millions, and some say 80-something million, but the conservative numbers, 7 million.
[01:21:37.503 --> 01:21:37.983]  That's enough.
[01:21:38.924 --> 01:21:40.585]  The Pentagon report says, of weapons.
[01:21:40.925 --> 01:21:42.406]  He gave Iran 6 billion.
[01:21:42.446 --> 01:21:44.748]  They used it to pay for these suicide squads.
[01:21:44.988 --> 01:21:45.288]  Boom!
[01:21:45.529 --> 01:21:45.809]  Done!
[01:21:45.929 --> 01:21:47.370]  Impeach Biden for this, now.
[01:21:48.631 --> 01:21:50.052]  Yes, sir.
[01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:54.675]  Like I said, I've watched my entire life, my freedoms being eroded, my country being raped.
[01:21:55.208 --> 01:22:01.991]  And it's like you said decades ago, they want 30, 40 million people dead, black uniforms, war, whole cities on fire.
[01:22:02.031 --> 01:22:02.692]  They want it all.
[01:22:03.192 --> 01:22:04.553]  They want our souls.
[01:22:06.614 --> 01:22:10.156]  It's an assault, and they're going to break eggs to make their satanic omelette.
[01:22:10.336 --> 01:22:10.996]  Powerfully said.
[01:22:11.036 --> 01:22:11.676]  Thank you, James.
[01:22:12.197 --> 01:22:13.677]  I'm moving quick to get all of you here on air.
[01:22:13.937 --> 01:22:15.618]  Let's talk to Ferris in California.
[01:22:16.379 --> 01:22:16.879]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:22:18.103 --> 01:22:20.244]  Hi Alex, first-time speaker.
[01:22:20.464 --> 01:22:25.245]  First of all, I just want to say I recently started to listen to you about three, four months ago.
[01:22:25.265 --> 01:22:32.788]  I mean, beforehand, I was a Bernie supporter, you know, AOC, all those people, and you know, that sense changed.
[01:22:34.889 --> 01:22:56.413]   And I'm a Christian, and I'm a Palestinian also, and I just want to say, like, How can people just be openly expressing and saying that, you know, the Palestinians, you know, whatever it is they're going through in this situation that's going on right now, that it's unjustified for them to rise up and all that stuff.
[01:22:56.513 --> 01:23:03.017]  And let me say, obviously, I'm not condoning, I'm not justifying killing innocent women, men, children, things like that.
[01:23:04.378 --> 01:23:09.061]  Frankly, to be honest, it's disrespectful that I feel like I have to preface that before anything I say.
[01:23:11.471 --> 01:23:26.293]  You know, I mean, there's been so much conflict and so much trouble that's been going on between the two of them, even leading up, you know, they get their water cut off, you know, there's a lot of discrimination, humiliation, you know, Palestinian children getting killed all the time.
[01:23:27.395 --> 01:23:33.036]  You know, these people, they're in a boiling pot and a pressure cooker.
[01:23:33.256 --> 01:23:34.797]  Well, sir, I want to be 100% clear.
[01:23:34.877 --> 01:23:44.879]  You're born in the 70 years since this went on, into the Gaza Strip, you're raised by your mother, you're told all this stuff, and then your family gets $100,000 for you to go suicide bomb.
[01:23:45.299 --> 01:23:47.439]  I get they believe they're doing the right thing.
[01:23:47.859 --> 01:23:52.880]  I'm saying it's a larger operation against humanity that's going on here.
[01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:56.321]  Yeah, and I think you are right about that, and I'm with you.
[01:23:57.774 --> 01:24:03.385]  You know, I'm not for any of the suicide bombers or, you know, the terrorists, anything like that.
[01:24:04.106 --> 01:24:05.308]  All I'm saying is this, listen to me.
[01:24:05.889 --> 01:24:06.771]  Look how the left...
[01:24:07.822 --> 01:24:11.025]  is allied with this invasion and selling it is okay.
[01:24:11.526 --> 01:24:18.052]  I'm saying Netanyahu gets power out of it, the Israelis stood down, there should be an investigation, whoever did it should be impeached, fired, removed.
[01:24:18.792 --> 01:24:30.183]  Biden needs to be removed for giving 7 billion weapons, 7 billion dollars, that's the conservative number, not debated, I know it's 80 plus billion, but the point is 7 billion pentagon amends for the subject of debate.
[01:24:30.423 --> 01:24:34.666]   Let's just, whether it's a billion or 100 billion, It's obviously more than, you know, it's a lot.
[01:24:35.287 --> 01:24:37.429]  And then six billion to Iran a month ago.
[01:24:37.869 --> 01:24:38.770]  They did this.
[01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:40.111]  Why did they do it?
[01:24:40.151 --> 01:24:41.572]  They knew Iran would do this.
[01:24:42.392 --> 01:24:44.774]  So I'm talking 35,000 foot view here.
[01:24:44.814 --> 01:24:45.535]  I appreciate your call.
[01:24:46.696 --> 01:24:47.396]  That's where I'm at here.
[01:24:48.737 --> 01:24:49.037]  All right.
[01:24:49.077 --> 01:24:50.578]  Next up, Brian in North Carolina.
[01:24:50.598 --> 01:24:51.119]  Thanks for calling.
[01:24:51.139 --> 01:24:51.599]  You're on the air.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:53.681]  Hey, Alex.
[01:24:53.781 --> 01:24:54.662]  Thank you for everything.
[01:24:54.722 --> 01:25:01.332]   I want to thank my wife for Forget me to watch your show, okay?
[01:25:02.413 --> 01:25:06.175]  The reason why I'm calling is, remember Obama and the planes?
[01:25:06.335 --> 01:25:10.298]  Loads of money, him and Obama, and Biden brought to Iran.
[01:25:12.219 --> 01:25:15.461]  Yeah, they do it over and over again because they need somebody to fund destabilization.
[01:25:16.022 --> 01:25:16.942]  The Iranians do it.
[01:25:17.002 --> 01:25:17.282]  Sick.
[01:25:18.563 --> 01:25:18.743]  Right?
[01:25:19.264 --> 01:25:24.707]  And the drone that just landed without a problem so they can take a look at it.
[01:25:25.127 --> 01:25:27.229]  That just teed me off.
[01:25:27.609 --> 01:25:28.790]  But that's all I got to say.
[01:25:30.296 --> 01:25:32.678]  I hear you, brother, and it's very upsetting to watch all this happen.
[01:25:32.738 --> 01:25:34.038]  Play the audio of the rave here.
[01:25:34.099 --> 01:25:34.379]  Play it.
[01:25:34.919 --> 01:25:38.721]  While the... While Cobra flies in.
[01:25:38.782 --> 01:25:39.702]  It's like right out of a G.I.
[01:25:39.722 --> 01:25:40.903]  Joe show from the 1980s.
[01:25:42.764 --> 01:25:46.527]  I mean, the Israelis are out there partying and stuff.
[01:25:46.547 --> 01:25:47.147]  They have no idea.
[01:25:47.167 --> 01:25:48.428]  They're like completely surrounded.
[01:25:49.828 --> 01:25:51.469]  And a whole bunch of liberals have moved in.
[01:25:52.009 --> 01:25:53.970]  They're saying, like, two-thirds didn't have guns.
[01:25:55.011 --> 01:25:59.993]  On the border with the Gaza Strip, you live next to two-plus million people who want to kill you, and you don't have a gun?
[01:26:02.735 --> 01:26:03.695]  Like, oh, we're protected.
[01:26:03.915 --> 01:26:04.636]  Uh, no, you're not.
[01:26:06.817 --> 01:26:11.359]  Look, they keep dancing as the shots are being fired and missiles at a distance.
[01:26:13.069 --> 01:26:14.109]  There's longer footage of this.
[01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:15.050]  It is crazy.
[01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:18.530]  As they finally figure out, a bunch of them got kidnapped, got killed.
[01:26:18.670 --> 01:26:19.951]  I mean, this is just disgusting.
[01:26:20.571 --> 01:26:22.652]  Carlos in Texas, thanks for holding your own here.
[01:26:22.672 --> 01:26:25.632]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:25.772 --> 01:26:26.793]  I am from Bolivia.
[01:26:26.933 --> 01:26:32.554]  I was the first independent presidential candidate for the 2020 elections.
[01:26:33.374 --> 01:26:38.776]  And, of course, the party, Docracia, didn't allow me to participate.
[01:26:38.816 --> 01:26:39.396]  But, anyway.
[01:26:40.077 --> 01:26:45.264]  The thing is that Biden cannot win in 2024.
[01:26:45.865 --> 01:26:47.667]  They have to rig the elections.
[01:26:47.827 --> 01:26:49.029]  That's not going to be enough.
[01:26:49.069 --> 01:26:51.432]  They're letting 7 million people.
[01:26:51.452 --> 01:26:57.059]  Yeah, but he's saying they gotta have a big crisis to divert us, and that's what we've been saying, and here it is.
[01:26:58.135 --> 01:26:58.395]  Right.
[01:26:58.816 --> 01:27:04.701]  And so, since they are losing the war in Ukraine, they need to have a different war.
[01:27:04.882 --> 01:27:07.144]  And Netanyahu is low in the polls.
[01:27:08.305 --> 01:27:13.390]  Sixty percent are opposing him, as I think you stated that, too, and I read somewhere else.
[01:27:14.108 --> 01:27:22.395]  So, Netanyahu is going to use this, and the Ayatollah pro-nuclear—I'm sure they have nuclear weapons, too.
[01:27:22.455 --> 01:27:33.165]  They are low internally, so everybody wants a war, and that's where we are going to, and we need to do something to stop this.
[01:27:34.005 --> 01:27:44.424]   It's humanicide against people, and I thank you for risking your life and being up front, About all this.
[01:27:44.524 --> 01:27:45.445]  Thank you so much.
[01:27:45.585 --> 01:27:46.906]  I'm passing by San Marcos.
[01:27:46.946 --> 01:27:50.109]  Maybe I'm going to be in Austin at some point, but thank you so much.
[01:27:50.469 --> 01:27:51.390]  Keep on doing it.
[01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:53.331]  You did a great job.
[01:27:53.371 --> 01:27:54.011]  Well, no, thank you.
[01:27:54.051 --> 01:27:58.074]  You sound like a really interesting fellow, and I believe that you ran for president down in Bolivia.
[01:27:58.134 --> 01:27:59.576]  Do you have a website?
[01:27:59.596 --> 01:28:00.336]  Do you have a name?
[01:28:00.356 --> 01:28:02.157]  I mean, is there a place where people can find you?
[01:28:02.758 --> 01:28:23.117]   Yeah, my name is Carlos Aliaga Uria, and I am the first independent candidate that Uh, try to run in the 2020 presidential elections in Bolivia without political parties because from right and left... Sure, what I'm saying is, I mean, do you have a Twitter account or do you have, where people find you?
[01:28:23.858 --> 01:28:30.063]  Oh, I am in, uh, I am in, uh, in Facebook, uh, and, uh, let's see.
[01:28:30.323 --> 01:28:31.925]  Okay, I'll give you my, why not?
[01:28:32.025 --> 01:28:36.728]  I'll give you my, uh, email is... No, I don't email, but I appreciate you, brother.
[01:28:36.748 --> 01:28:37.349]  Thanks for calling.
[01:28:37.909 --> 01:28:39.391]  All right, Jay in Georgia.
[01:28:39.431 --> 01:28:40.171]  Jay, you're on the air.
[01:28:40.211 --> 01:28:40.612]  Go ahead.
[01:28:40.652 --> 01:28:40.972]  Welcome.
[01:28:41.957 --> 01:28:43.737]  Alex Jones, man, God bless you, brother.
[01:28:43.777 --> 01:28:59.181]  Listen, I can talk about the end-time eschatology of what I see going on in Israel with Ezekiel 38 and Matthew 24, but I think from that 30,000 square foot view, what's really going on when, you know, you look at 9-11 and what did it bring to the United States?
[01:28:59.261 --> 01:29:09.144]  It brought forth the Patriot Act, which is what we see now, the full effect of that lockdown, that surveillance grid, you know, what they're, I believe they're using this as like a Pearl Harbor 2.0 and 9-11.
[01:29:10.675 --> 01:29:18.100]  And out of that, yes, there's biblical things that are taking place that we see, but they're going to use this chaos when Israel strikes back, Alex.
[01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:30.307]  They're going to use this chaos to then make all of Israel the enemy of the world, which is going to bring in them to talk about the Abraham Accords, the peace deal that Jared Kushner and all of them.
[01:29:30.347 --> 01:29:33.569]  You look at all of the African nations who are coming under bricks.
[01:29:34.136 --> 01:29:35.697]  How are they going to bring that peace deal?
[01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:39.740]  So how are they going to bring that new Patriot Act at a global level?
[01:29:40.101 --> 01:29:46.665]  This is what the elite, I believe, are using for that very trigger in order to go ahead and pull that thing together.
[01:29:46.705 --> 01:30:04.909]   Pull the Abraham Accords, the Abraham House that's already been the Abu Dhabi, you know, the One World Religion, and we could get into the end-time eschatology, but just from a real-time law, The only thing, Alex, that's ever kept Israel and the Palestinian state becoming, you know, that two-state solution has been the law.
[01:30:05.169 --> 01:30:15.257]   Well, this would give them the opportunity through this chaos, through this unnecessary destruction, And we see all of the nations of the world coming against Israel.
[01:30:15.617 --> 01:30:18.919]  They're going to bring in this Abraham, this new world peace deal.
[01:30:19.239 --> 01:30:22.080]  And this is what I think they're setting all this up for, brother.
[01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:23.741]  I don't know what your thoughts are on that.
[01:30:23.841 --> 01:30:25.702]  We certainly pray for Israel.
[01:30:25.982 --> 01:30:27.903]  We need to pray for the Palestinian nation.
[01:30:28.163 --> 01:30:29.383]  We need to pray for America.
[01:30:29.683 --> 01:30:30.764]  This is a serious deal.
[01:30:31.104 --> 01:30:31.324]  Yes, sir.
[01:30:31.344 --> 01:30:32.465]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:30:32.525 --> 01:30:34.166]  I'm looking right at my screen right now.
[01:30:33.985 --> 01:30:37.985]   over and over again, but I believe the Bible says there's many Antichrists, but it's the one big one.
[01:30:37.985 --> 01:30:41.145]   I agree, they're trying this, they're setting the pattern up now,
[01:30:41.145 --> 01:30:45.664]   whether this is it or whether it comes in 20 years or 100 years or five years or right now,
[01:30:45.664 --> 01:30:47.345]  we need to be ready for the return of Christ.
[01:30:47.345 --> 01:30:48.546]  Thank you so much, Jay.
[01:30:48.546 --> 01:30:50.845]  Let's talk to Bart in Florida.
[01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:53.305]  Bart, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:30:53.305 --> 01:30:55.225]  Yes, sir, thanks for taking my call.
[01:30:55.225 --> 01:30:57.465]  I'm looking right at my screen right now.
[01:30:57.465 --> 01:31:04.265]   I'm talking about weapons that were intended for Ukraine are being sold or shipped to Iran,
[01:31:04.265 --> 01:31:06.305]  which we know is the proxy state.
[01:31:06.104 --> 01:31:06.906]  Oh, it's all confirmed.
[01:31:06.966 --> 01:31:07.607]  It's U.S.
[01:31:07.727 --> 01:31:08.068]  weapons.
[01:31:08.288 --> 01:31:08.890]  That's confirmed.
[01:31:10.137 --> 01:31:16.382]  Yeah, and I'm smelling an attempt to put us into martial law under the War Powers Act.
[01:31:16.502 --> 01:31:19.925]  Oh yeah, they get 10,000 Hezbollah and there's at least that much here in the U.S.
[01:31:20.245 --> 01:31:21.506]  to go out and kill a bunch of people.
[01:31:21.526 --> 01:31:22.687]  We're in martial law, brother.
[01:31:22.987 --> 01:31:26.630]  And you know they'll use that martial law to disappear you and I. I just showed the documents.
[01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:28.991]  FBI says the main threat's the American people.
[01:31:30.873 --> 01:31:31.333]  Yes, sir.
[01:31:31.353 --> 01:31:37.938]  The last thing I have to say, if everybody could go to Bart Fine on Rumble and Bitchute and even ScrewTube, thank you, Alex.
[01:31:38.038 --> 01:31:38.659]  It's been an honor.
[01:31:39.315 --> 01:31:40.075]  God bless you, sir.
[01:31:41.316 --> 01:31:41.856]  Next caller.
[01:31:42.336 --> 01:31:43.297]  Chris in North Carolina.
[01:31:43.317 --> 01:31:43.797]  You're on the air.
[01:31:45.418 --> 01:31:45.978]  Hey, Alex.
[01:31:47.079 --> 01:31:47.819]  Long time fan.
[01:31:48.359 --> 01:31:50.260]  God bless you.
[01:31:50.780 --> 01:32:03.987]  I just would like to know what Israel would think about doing when they find out after this war escalates that most of the weapons came from that Afghanistan withdrawal debacle.
[01:32:04.287 --> 01:32:05.027]  We now know that.
[01:32:04.967 --> 01:32:19.367]  I mean it's that Ukraine.
[01:32:20.177 --> 01:32:22.538]  Basically making a donation to a terrorist organization.
[01:32:22.558 --> 01:32:24.019]  Well, that's what I was about to say.
[01:32:24.879 --> 01:32:25.800]  No one's saying this.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:36.185]  Biden must be impeached for giving tens of billions of dollars in the Afghan withdrawal and six billion last month to Hezbollah, to the Iranians.
[01:32:36.205 --> 01:32:37.386]  They admit are running this.
[01:32:37.886 --> 01:32:38.686]  They now admit it.
[01:32:38.766 --> 01:32:41.668]  Wall Street Journal, you know, the Iranians are bragging.
[01:32:42.771 --> 01:32:44.013]  So, there.
[01:32:44.133 --> 01:32:44.373]  Boom.
[01:32:44.814 --> 01:32:46.235]  Why did our government do that?
[01:32:46.276 --> 01:32:54.666]  Because they want this destabilization, and I think we're so stupid, we won't know it's them, and then when Hezbollah launches attacks, they might blame Trump supporters.
[01:32:54.886 --> 01:32:56.568]  They might use Hezbollah groups to do stuff.
[01:32:56.749 --> 01:32:57.990]  They'll claim they're Trump supporters.
[01:32:59.052 --> 01:32:59.452]  Oh, definitely.
[01:33:00.615 --> 01:33:01.436]  I'm telling you, it's on.
[01:33:01.456 --> 01:33:03.898]  This is just another sign we've gone over the edge, brother.

[01:33:41.443 --> 01:33:51.246]  You know, they lost in Ukraine, and now they're, you know, bringing this up, and then everything happens over there a year before... I agree.
[01:33:51.286 --> 01:33:53.166]  They end the COVID, introduce Ukraine.
[01:33:53.606 --> 01:33:56.267]  Ukraine and NATO's lost, now they bring this in.
