[00:00:03.581 --> 00:00:06.565]  It's Saturday, October 7th, 2023.
[00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:07.126]  It's 1240.
[00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.709]  We're launching an emergency broadcast now.
[00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.572]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now.
[00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:12.633]  This is critical information.
[00:00:14.596 --> 00:00:15.557]  InfoWars.
[00:00:15.938 --> 00:00:18.742]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:26.588]  Well, the crew was gonna get a day off today but I called them and they came in and I really appreciate them because I woke up at about 5 a.m.
[00:00:26.628 --> 00:00:49.745]   this morning and Hezbollah slash Iran had launched a massive attack in the south of Israel in the central areas and in the north with kamikaze paragliders with kamikaze drones with thousands over 5,000 missiles Biggest attack on Israel in decades.
[00:00:50.505 --> 00:00:54.586]  Now, there's a lot of news and a lot of coverage of this.
[00:00:55.546 --> 00:01:07.769]  In less than 10 hours, we've seen more coverage of what's happening in Israel than what we've seen in a year and a half in the exploding war between NATO and Russia in Ukraine.
[00:01:09.855 --> 00:01:10.795]  Israel at war.
[00:01:10.855 --> 00:01:12.256]  Hamas surprise attack.
[00:01:12.356 --> 00:01:14.076]  At least 100 killed, 1,000 wounded.
[00:01:14.096 --> 00:01:15.536]  It should be a lot more than that.
[00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:16.776]  Many hostages taken.
[00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:19.197]  Young and old snatched off the street.
[00:01:19.357 --> 00:01:20.957]  Israel calls up all reserves.
[00:01:21.657 --> 00:01:23.378]  Calls for dual citizenship.
[00:01:23.598 --> 00:01:26.559]  Citizens in other countries to come to Israel for the fight.
[00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:30.579]  They're handing out automatic weapons and grenade launchers to the general public.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.801]  The Hamas Palestinians have poured across to the Gaza Strip into southern Israel.
[00:01:38.817 --> 00:01:40.098]  Let's get the big takeaways here.
[00:01:39.917 --> 00:01:47.117]   over the country, particularly overrunning many miles into southern Israel.
[00:01:47.117 --> 00:01:53.276]   And now the Israeli defense forces are having to go through it block to block in heavy house
[00:01:53.276 --> 00:01:54.276]  fighting.
[00:01:54.276 --> 00:01:59.877]   But before I drill through all what's currently happening, let's get the big takeaways here.
[00:01:59.877 --> 00:02:17.837]   First off, and I'm not attacking Israel here, but I'm stating a fact.
[00:02:05.547 --> 00:02:13.511]  There is no way that Shin Bet and the Mossad did not know that Iran, who's running this, was gearing up for this.
[00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:43.512]   This is a massive attack with tens of thousands of militia soldiers, over 5,000 missiles and growing, hundreds of men on paragliders coming in, groups in motorcycles and bulldozers smashing through barbed wire, And of course they struck during the Sabbath on Saturday when they would have lower levels of security forces.
[00:02:44.093 --> 00:02:50.619]  But if you don't think that that border between Gaza Strip and Israel isn't the most militarized of the planet, you're not informed.
[00:02:51.488 --> 00:02:55.690]  So I'm not saying that isn't a real Hezbollah attack.
[00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.211]  I'm not saying Iran isn't behind it.
[00:02:57.251 --> 00:02:57.931]  Of course they are.
[00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:00.372]  I think it's a terrible situation.
[00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:01.512]  It's escalating out of control.
[00:03:01.572 --> 00:03:07.315]  But the big takeaway here is they're calling it the biggest intelligence failure in Israeli history.
[00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:11.177]  Just like 9-11, the biggest intelligence failure in U.S.
[00:03:11.197 --> 00:03:11.537]  history.
[00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:17.319]  But they had nothing but thousands of warnings and knew the exact specifics, and there were stand-downs taken.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.461]  This will definitely help Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:03:21.397 --> 00:03:22.838]  Who was about to be ousted from power.
[00:03:23.538 --> 00:03:27.999]  Israel's devolving into a totalitarian state, according to the majority of Jews.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.300]  You ask, why can't they vote out people?
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.701]  Because it's just like Trudeau.
[00:03:32.041 --> 00:03:33.641]  Got 30% of the vote in Canada.
[00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:37.282]  He can do it with a coalition government, with a whole bunch of sub-parties.
[00:03:37.623 --> 00:03:39.343]  Can add their support and he's the Prime Minister.
[00:03:40.023 --> 00:03:42.204]  And I'm not here even demonizing Netanyahu.
[00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:43.064]  It's the Jews.
[00:03:43.865 --> 00:03:46.606]  60 plus percent in Israel are pissed off at Netanyahu.
[00:03:47.546 --> 00:03:52.228]  The different things he's been doing, and the lockdowns, and the Pfizer rollout, and quote, judicial reform.
[00:03:52.588 --> 00:03:54.789]  So there's a lot of moving parts here, but let's pull back from those.
[00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.931]  Those are big, but they're still penultimate, meaning not the number one issue.
[00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:07.714]  The number one issue is Biden gave $6 billion last month of frozen assets to Iran.
[00:04:08.554 --> 00:04:15.357]  President Trump predicted, and I have his predictions right here, that within a few months, Iran would attack Israel.
[00:04:17.073 --> 00:04:25.483]  We got footage in Tehran that's on screen where they were celebrating the attack today.
[00:04:25.523 --> 00:04:32.163]   There's video out of Yemen with millions in the streets celebrating a lot of really dramatic footage
[00:04:32.163 --> 00:04:35.563]  the Palestinians are celebrating.
[00:04:35.563 --> 00:04:39.802]   Now, I want to be clear, depending on which side you're on, both sides have beefs with each other.
[00:04:39.802 --> 00:04:42.443]  And I'm not an apologist for Israel.
[00:04:42.443 --> 00:04:48.783]   I'm not also an enemy of Israel, and I understand Israel's perspective.
[00:04:48.783 --> 00:04:54.603]   I am also not an enemy of the Palestinians, but the rest of the Arab countries use
[00:04:54.603 --> 00:04:59.282]   that giant population that's growing and growing that they won't take into their own countries
[00:04:59.282 --> 00:05:04.282]  as a proxy state, just like China uses North Korea on us.
[00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:14.562]  So I'm trying to be a political atheist when it comes to this, so I can cold-bloodedly analyze what's going on in realpolitik.
[00:05:15.743 --> 00:05:17.205]  And that's what Henry Kissinger calls it.
[00:05:17.225 --> 00:05:19.208]  I don't agree with the mindset.
[00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.812]  Of real polity, where you just sociopathically look at the world.
[00:05:24.272 --> 00:05:28.115]  But I look at it like that through the globalist lens to understand what's the bigger picture?
[00:05:28.676 --> 00:05:30.117]  What's the Hegelian dialectic?
[00:05:30.717 --> 00:05:37.883]  What is this going to lead to with Israel leveling apartment buildings and obviously is going to kill, I would imagine, tens of thousands of people.
[00:05:38.343 --> 00:05:42.747]  Thousands of people in Israel are obviously probably already dead or about to be dead.
[00:05:43.247 --> 00:05:44.488]  Thousands and thousands wounded.
[00:05:44.508 --> 00:05:47.270]  They got overrun at least five, six miles.
[00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:48.732]  That's a lot, Israel's little bitty.
[00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:52.313]  I mean, this is a war.
[00:05:53.134 --> 00:05:57.055]  And I agree with Hezbollah when they said this is war, we declare war.
[00:05:57.075 --> 00:06:02.677]  I agree with Netanyahu when he said this is a war, because this is a war.
[00:06:03.758 --> 00:06:12.001]  So, bare minimum, the Israeli military and Mossad knew that a big buildup was coming.
[00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:17.103]  They may not have known the exact moment, but there's no way to have tens of thousands of people that participated in this.
[00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:36.480]  Tens of thousands on the Arab side, on the Muslim side, on the Palestinian side, on the Iranian side, on the side of the occupied areas, or unoccupied, or those different zones with the expanding Jewish settlements going into them.
[00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:38.622]  So no one can debate.
[00:06:40.151 --> 00:06:47.076]  That Benjamin Netanyahu was given briefings in the last week that an imminent attack, a massive attack was coming.
[00:06:47.736 --> 00:06:58.163]  They've got Arab spies all over the Gaza Strip to the south and the Golan Heights to the north and all the rest of it.
[00:06:58.384 --> 00:07:02.186]  You can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit an Israeli asset.
[00:07:03.347 --> 00:07:03.667]  Okay?
[00:07:05.088 --> 00:07:05.308]  So...
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.982]  The fact that the Israelis didn't know this was coming is boulder-dash.
[00:07:11.902 --> 00:07:14.604]  No one has got better signals intelligence than the Israelis.
[00:07:15.144 --> 00:07:17.925]  They are jacked into the telecommunications system worldwide.
[00:07:18.205 --> 00:07:19.706]  They're basically bigger than the NSA.
[00:07:21.327 --> 00:07:23.688]  And so, that needs to be investigated.
[00:07:25.308 --> 00:07:27.249]  Now, let's talk big picture.
[00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:32.371]  The minute I woke up this morning and saw this, I thought, wow, Iran is trying to draw Israel into a full war.
[00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:33.232]  They think they're ready.
[00:07:34.352 --> 00:07:38.416]  And sure enough, later, the Mullahs were like, we want a full war with Israel.
[00:07:38.896 --> 00:07:39.356]  We're ready.
[00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:41.158]  Why are they ready?
[00:07:41.458 --> 00:07:47.984]  I was told by high-level individuals over a decade ago that Iran already has atomic bombs.
[00:07:50.866 --> 00:07:52.467]  And that's one reason Israel and the U.S.
[00:07:52.487 --> 00:07:53.248]  haven't moved against them.
[00:07:53.268 --> 00:07:54.869]  It's all, we got to stop them from getting a bomb.
[00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:00.243]   You know, technically, Fact checkers say Jones is wrong, Iran doesn't have a bomb.
[00:08:00.663 --> 00:08:07.548]  I saw a guy on Joe Rogan last month attacking me saying, Jones says a lot of stuff is true, but I heard him say a decade ago that Iran has atomic bombs.
[00:08:07.929 --> 00:08:15.715]  Well, buddy, you don't know people flying around in the airplanes and that have access to the satellites like I do, who told me they have the signature scanners.
[00:08:16.803 --> 00:08:19.826]  Particle scanners that tell them that they've got atomic bombs.
[00:08:21.088 --> 00:08:22.629]  And so we'll just see who's right in the end.
[00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:29.517]  But the point is, to all the fools that don't think Iran has nuclear weapons, no one knew India had them for a long time.
[00:08:29.577 --> 00:08:31.819]  No one knew Pakistan had them for a long time decades ago.
[00:08:31.859 --> 00:08:32.940]  It turned out they'd had them for decades.
[00:08:33.761 --> 00:08:37.844]  And you don't think it's only Americans in the 1940s that can make an atomic bomb.
[00:08:38.304 --> 00:08:39.705]  They got smart people, okay?
[00:08:40.146 --> 00:08:44.709]  The Persians are smart, the Indians are smart, the Chinese are smart, the Pakistanis are smart.
[00:08:45.409 --> 00:08:47.251]  They got some of the best mathematicians, okay?
[00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:54.256]  So we kind of get arrogant here in the West and think brown people can't come up with weapons, and that's horse crap, okay?
[00:08:55.116 --> 00:08:57.898]  So, here's the bigger takeaway.
[00:08:58.398 --> 00:09:04.330]   We're officially told That Israel doesn't have nuclear weapons.
[00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:08.615]  They've had nuclear weapons since 1964 at least.
[00:09:08.956 --> 00:09:10.518]  They've got thousands of them.
[00:09:10.838 --> 00:09:13.562]  And they've got submarines, and they've got...
[00:09:15.552 --> 00:09:20.853]  Fighter bombers, and they've got cruise missiles, and they've got thousands of nuclear warheads.
[00:09:21.313 --> 00:09:26.374]  Israel is arguably the fifth largest nuclear power in the world.
[00:09:26.754 --> 00:09:29.154]  So let's just get that straight, too.
[00:09:29.495 --> 00:09:33.115]  And we can have somebody go on Joe Rogan and say Alex Jones doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:09:33.535 --> 00:09:34.775]  Israel doesn't have nuclear weapons.
[00:09:35.156 --> 00:09:35.816]  Yes, they do.
[00:09:36.056 --> 00:09:37.536]  Let me tell you something else.
[00:09:38.636 --> 00:09:40.336]  Saudi Arabia has nuclear weapons.
[00:09:41.457 --> 00:09:42.457]  They've had them for at least 30 years.
[00:09:44.295 --> 00:09:56.305]  George Herbert Walker Bush allowed them to get multiple warheads, according to my sources, as a deal for some of the things that went on in the Middle East.
[00:09:56.945 --> 00:10:00.188]  So, these things are proliferated all the time.
[00:10:00.708 --> 00:10:03.770]  South Africa secretly had nuclear weapons under apartheid.
[00:10:04.391 --> 00:10:07.593]  Nuclear weapons are all over the place.
[00:10:08.669 --> 00:10:09.510]  I mean, look at this article.
[00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:10.630]  The U.S.
[00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.432]  discovers Israel's secret nuclear arsenal.
[00:10:16.794 --> 00:10:18.335]  And that was just a few years ago.
[00:10:19.515 --> 00:10:21.697]  Ab-solutely ridiculous.
[00:10:22.617 --> 00:10:43.582]   There are different operations, different Israeli documents have leaked by people in the Israeli government decades ago that were concerned about this because they've got the Samson option They've got the Gideon option, and these are the names of secret Israeli nuclear war doctrines.
[00:10:44.463 --> 00:10:51.227]  They have a nuclear war doctrine with Europe, a nuclear war doctrine with Russia, they have a nuclear war doctrine with Saudi Arabia, a nuclear war doctrine with Iran.
[00:10:51.247 --> 00:10:54.769]  Do I have to remind you what Samson did?
[00:10:57.911 --> 00:11:00.532]  He brought down the temple and his eyes have been gouged out.
[00:11:02.613 --> 00:11:06.976]  If you believe the old fable, he collapsed it all himself and killed the bad guys with him.
[00:11:08.612 --> 00:11:09.973]  What did Gideon do?
[00:11:10.033 --> 00:11:13.856]  I mean, you know, they have the Masada option.
[00:11:14.356 --> 00:11:20.240]  And these are all doomsday scenarios that Israel has in place.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.122]  So, I'm historically and militarily informed.
[00:11:24.203 --> 00:11:28.706]  And your average talking head on television is not, and has no idea what's going on.
[00:11:29.366 --> 00:11:35.811]  So, over 5,000 missiles and counting, that number's a couple hours old, they say more are raining down right now.
[00:11:36.815 --> 00:11:38.556]  And some of them are larger than the past ones.
[00:11:39.036 --> 00:11:42.898]  It's killed a whole bunch of people, cars, buildings, you name it, are on fire.
[00:11:43.638 --> 00:11:55.743]  But that was the artillery distraction for the overrunning of much of southern Israel by forces of the militia of Iran known as Hezbollah.
[00:11:59.005 --> 00:11:59.365]  Hamas.
[00:12:01.966 --> 00:12:07.433]  I know there's two different groups, but it's Hezbollah and Hamas.
[00:12:08.493 --> 00:12:14.973]   The point is, is that this is all very, very, very upsetting and disgusting.
[00:12:14.973 --> 00:12:23.932]   And guys, pull up the definition of Hezbollah for me, print it up and the definition of Hamas.
[00:12:24.138 --> 00:12:25.638]  One's the Sunnis, one's the Shiites.
[00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:34.202]  And sometimes I flip names around and things like that, but Hezbollah works for Iran.
[00:12:36.063 --> 00:12:38.724]  Hamas is the Sunni-backed one.
[00:12:39.445 --> 00:12:40.245]  And that's what I'm saying.
[00:12:41.045 --> 00:12:41.966]  And I'm sticking to that.
[00:12:42.746 --> 00:12:44.607]  Even though people are popping in my ear telling me the opposite.
[00:12:45.643 --> 00:12:59.054]  So, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, the point is, is that this is all unfolding right now, and Iran is celebrating it, and Iran is basically taking credit for it.
[00:12:59.614 --> 00:13:09.162]  And so regardless of what you think of Iran, whether you like them, hate them, or indifferent, I'm neutral on the thing.
[00:13:09.943 --> 00:13:10.964]  I want to stop World War III.
[00:13:12.239 --> 00:13:15.441]  And we have Iran helping Russia with drones and all the rest of it.
[00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:25.226]  So you can see how this war is expanding with this coalition of Russia, Iran, China, and now North Korea.
[00:13:26.107 --> 00:13:32.911]  And then financially, you've got Brazil and India and the BRICS nations teamed up with China and Russia.
[00:13:34.972 --> 00:13:36.172]  And so the U.S.
[00:13:36.252 --> 00:13:42.272]   policies The U.S.
[00:13:42.332 --> 00:13:53.218]  policies that are taking place here, of giving $6 billion to Iran last month, is definitely part of this.
[00:13:53.778 --> 00:13:59.141]  Here's the Times of Israel, Hezbollah praises Hamas's attack, its message, Arab countries normalizing ties with Israel.
[00:14:00.301 --> 00:14:04.764]  But you notice what I'm saying is, is the Israelis are saying Iran is behind this.
[00:14:05.686 --> 00:14:06.886]  Not even so much Hamas.
[00:14:07.467 --> 00:14:10.227]  And yes, obviously Hamas is a big part of the whole thing.
[00:14:10.527 --> 00:14:17.810]  What I'm saying is when it comes to attacking Israel, the Shiites and the Sunnis end up joining forces.
[00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.191]  So yes, technically you can say both ways are right.
[00:14:23.891 --> 00:14:27.633]  Hamas is the Islamic resistance movement.
[00:14:29.415 --> 00:14:38.440]  Sunni Islamic fundamentalists, militant and nationalist organization as a social service wing, Dawah, and is a military wing.
[00:14:40.021 --> 00:14:49.266]  Then you've got Hezbollah, which is Lebanese Shia, Islamist political party and militant group, and again that's backed by Iran.
[00:14:50.294 --> 00:14:56.659]  But my point is, is that I do agree with Israel that this is Iranian at the end of the day.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:04.225]  The news is trying to say that it's mainly Hamas because that is the main group that's in control there in the Gaza Strip.
[00:15:05.607 --> 00:15:08.951]  And the crew member popping my ear to make sure I get this right has been in the U.S.
[00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:10.913]  military and worked over there and was a translator.
[00:15:11.354 --> 00:15:12.575]  They certainly know more about it than I do.
[00:15:12.976 --> 00:15:20.465]  My point is that the two groups are connected at the hip, and that is what is going on here.
[00:15:21.601 --> 00:15:30.965]  So the big takeaway is, whether you are in any of those different Middle Eastern countries, or whether you're in Persia, which is Iran, they are celebrating it.
[00:15:31.406 --> 00:15:34.407]  In fact, I've got some footage here of the celebrations.
[00:15:34.447 --> 00:15:38.349]  That's clip 12, 2, and 4.
[00:15:38.288 --> 00:15:40.288]  Let's go ahead and roll those clips.
[00:15:40.288 --> 00:15:50.288]  [FOREIGN]
[00:15:50.288 --> 00:16:00.288]  [FOREIGN]
[00:16:00.288 --> 00:16:10.288]  [FOREIGN]
[00:16:10.288 --> 00:16:20.288]  [FOREIGN]
[00:16:20.288 --> 00:16:30.288]  [FOREIGN]
[00:16:30.288 --> 00:16:40.288]  [MUSIC]
[00:16:40.288 --> 00:16:50.288]  [MUSIC]
[00:16:50.288 --> 00:16:58.288]  [MUSIC]
[00:16:58.288 --> 00:16:59.608]  [FOREIGN]
[00:16:59.613 --> 00:17:04.017]  I would also like to return to my colleague Ahmed Ghanim, head of Al-Mayadeen.
[00:17:04.037 --> 00:17:18.227]  He is with us live, or excuse me, Akram Dallol, who is joining us live from the Gaza Strip, where the Yemenis are at the moment, in solidarity with Palestine, in solidarity with the Al-Aqsa flood.
[00:17:18.247 --> 00:17:23.791]  These are the scenes and the crowd directly from Yemen, which is besieged by all kinds of siege.
[00:17:25.452 --> 00:17:30.054]  Well again, if you're a radio listener, this is footage of what they're saying is a million people in the streets of Yemen.
[00:17:31.055 --> 00:17:33.056]  And you can see that, it goes on for miles.
[00:17:34.176 --> 00:17:38.018]  So yes, the corporate media is reporting that it's Hamas.
[00:17:39.479 --> 00:17:42.060]  Trump and the Israelis are saying that it's Hezbollah.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.421]  The answer is, it's both.
[00:17:44.661 --> 00:17:47.983]  Again, the Shiites are 20% of Islam.
[00:17:49.784 --> 00:18:00.092]   The Wahhabist Shia are 75% of Islam and then the Alawites and a few other minority groups of Islam make up the other 5%.
[00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:03.135]  But it is not one or the other group.
[00:18:04.095 --> 00:18:12.063]  The Shiites and the Sunnis are teamed up and Trump and the Israeli government are blaming Iran for backing this.
[00:18:13.979 --> 00:18:17.801]  There have been attacks mainly in the south but also the central areas of Israel and the north.
[00:18:18.161 --> 00:18:23.204]  Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran say Israel has only itself to blame for Hamas attacks.
[00:18:24.284 --> 00:18:26.365]  So they're trying to distance themselves right now.
[00:18:26.385 --> 00:18:33.129]  I know they were cheering it in the Iranian parliament just hours ago because they don't want to get blown off the map by Israel.
[00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:38.428]   Governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Iran appeared to back Hamas and its
[00:18:38.428 --> 00:18:42.188]   escalating conflict with Israel on Saturday. The Palestinian militant group
[00:18:42.188 --> 00:18:45.788]   launched a mass attack on Israel forces, settlements killing at least 100 people
[00:18:45.788 --> 00:18:51.629]   in Israel and 200 in Gaza early Saturday. While leaders of the US and Europe
[00:18:51.629 --> 00:18:55.629]   quickly denounced the attack, gave support for Israel, the three Middle
[00:18:55.629 --> 00:19:00.188]   Eastern nations criticized the country over its treatment of Palestinians.
[00:19:00.188 --> 00:19:03.829]   The King of Saudi Arabia is closely following the developments, of course it's where
[00:19:03.829 --> 00:19:12.909]  the Sunnis are based, of the unprecedented attack.
[00:19:11.252 --> 00:19:14.373]  So, we're going to be going over all this as it unfolds.
[00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:22.394]  And that's good news if Iran starts dissing itself because I don't want to see an open war between Israel and Iran.
[00:19:23.634 --> 00:19:30.576]  Israel vows revenge after Hamas terrorist opened gates of hell in Gaza with 15 taken hostage and hundreds killed.
[00:19:31.836 --> 00:19:38.437]  Hamas surprise attack out of Gaza Strip stuns Israel and leaves dozens dying in fighting and retaliation.
[00:19:40.686 --> 00:19:48.811]  Operation Sword of Iron, Israel hits 100 dead and nearly 1,000 injured, blowing up apartment buildings with 2,000-pound bombs.
[00:19:49.672 --> 00:19:51.373]  That's just some of the news we've got on this front.
[00:19:51.393 --> 00:19:56.616]  And obviously, we'll have a special guest and more on the Sunday show for four hours, 4 to 8 p.m.
[00:19:56.636 --> 00:19:59.278]  tomorrow, once we know a lot more about this.
[00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:09.054]  Here's Jack Posobiec tweeting, one month ago, Trump predicted the $6 billion that Biden gave Iran would be used for terror attacks across the Middle East and specifically kidnapping.
[00:20:09.415 --> 00:20:12.218]  This is exactly what we're seeing in Israel this morning.
[00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:15.085]  And here's Trump.
[00:20:15.125 --> 00:20:19.506]  Can you believe the crook of Joe Biden is giving $6 billion to the terrorist regime in Iran?
[00:20:19.826 --> 00:20:24.327]  That money would be used for terrorism all over the Middle East and indeed the world.
[00:20:24.667 --> 00:20:26.868]  This incompetent fool is absolutely destroying America.
[00:20:27.228 --> 00:20:32.869]  He had the capacity, I mean the audacity, to announce this terrible deal today, September 11th.
[00:20:33.869 --> 00:20:38.090]  To pay for hostages will lead to kidnapping, ransom, and blackmail against Americans across the globe.
[00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:43.071]  I've freed many dozens of people from various unfriendly countries and never paid a dime.
[00:20:45.814 --> 00:20:47.395]  And we've got new statements by Trump.
[00:20:48.496 --> 00:20:52.640]  They're up on InfoWars.com, where he is blaming Iran.
[00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:59.426]  And I think that's the main culprit with the actual funding, though they're working with the Shiites.
[00:20:59.566 --> 00:21:00.607]  We'll pull this up.
[00:21:01.107 --> 00:21:02.308]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:21:02.328 --> 00:21:04.790]  Perhaps you guys can print me the story.
[00:21:05.031 --> 00:21:05.831]  But here it is.
[00:21:06.612 --> 00:21:09.434]  Trump blasts Biden for Hamas attack on Israel.
[00:21:09.514 --> 00:21:12.217]  American taxpayer-funded dollars helped these attacks.
[00:21:13.459 --> 00:21:23.206]  Former President Trump said today he blamed Joe Biden for the Palestinian terror group Samas attack on Israel, citing his administration's unfreezing of billions of funds to Iran last month.
[00:21:23.586 --> 00:21:30.230]  The Samas attacks are a disgrace, and Israel has every right to defend itself with overwhelming force, Trump wrote on Truth Social.
[00:21:30.731 --> 00:21:37.315]  Sadly, American taxpayer dollars helped fund these attacks, with many reports saying it came from the Biden administration.
[00:21:37.995 --> 00:21:47.580]   We brought so much peace to the Middle East throughout the Abraham Accords only to see Biden Whittle it away at a far more rapid pace than anyone thought possible.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.340]  Here we go again.
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:22:03.963]  On September 8th, Secretary Blinken undertook the procedural step of ongoing process to ensure Iranian funds can move from the restricted account to another and remain restricted to humanitarian aid.
[00:22:04.863 --> 00:22:18.272]   National Security Council spokesman Andrea Watson said in a statement, as we have said from the outset, What is being pursued here is an arrangement where we secure the release of five wrongfully held Americans.
[00:22:18.692 --> 00:22:20.574]  This remains a sensitive and ongoing process.
[00:22:21.294 --> 00:22:24.937]  So, again, Trump is saying that the money came from Iran.
[00:22:25.398 --> 00:22:26.739]  Obviously, he's got a lot of good sources.
[00:22:26.779 --> 00:22:33.084]  So, I just instinctively know that Iran is going to be the one that's able to launch or fund attacks of this size.
[00:22:33.704 --> 00:22:37.487]  And Hamas has not been able to, but Hamas is taking the main credit.
[00:22:38.268 --> 00:22:42.990]  That way then just the Gaza Strip gets bombed and there's not a larger war with Iran.
[00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:54.094]  But I think Israel is going to blame Iran and I think Israel's going to at least bomb Iran and maybe go to full war with Iran.
[00:22:54.674 --> 00:22:56.195]  And we've seen these type of statements.
[00:22:56.815 --> 00:22:59.376]  I mean, certainly Israel's not going to attack Saudi Arabia.
[00:22:59.956 --> 00:23:02.237]  That's the headquarters of the Sunni.
[00:23:03.578 --> 00:23:05.158]  So again, this is tomorrow's news today.
[00:23:05.239 --> 00:23:06.039]  We'll see if I'm right.
[00:23:06.937 --> 00:23:09.037]  The mainstream media is telling us it's basically all Hamas.
[00:23:09.618 --> 00:23:11.718]  I'm saying it's mainly Hezbollah.
[00:23:12.838 --> 00:23:14.039]  But we will see.
[00:23:14.899 --> 00:23:17.699]  I mean, is it Hamas helping the Russians in Ukraine?
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:18.940]  No.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.120]  They don't have the capacity.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.821]  And that's what I wanted to get to next.
[00:23:22.861 --> 00:23:25.241]  What I know for a fact is incontrovertible.
[00:23:28.002 --> 00:23:32.983]  Iran has smuggled in and infiltrated this country.
[00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:40.603]  They report thousands a month coming across the Texas border, military-age men from Iran and from other Shiite countries.
[00:23:41.443 --> 00:23:45.525]  And they are very serious fighters, and they are willing to die in suicide missions.
[00:23:46.266 --> 00:23:54.130]  And if we ever do go to full-blown war with Iran, they're going to activate those groups to do very similar things to what you just saw done to Israel.
[00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.932]  And that's going to be terrible for those that get killed or the power grid that gets attacked.
[00:23:57.952 --> 00:23:59.113]  You know, Iran's been looking at that.
[00:23:59.653 --> 00:24:03.575]  But what I'm really worried about is how our liberties and freedoms will be taken.
[00:24:03.795 --> 00:24:12.119]  Because there's a, quote, Muslim threat on 9-11, so we then lose all our rights under the Patriot Act, whose main mission is Trump supporters and the American people today.
[00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:12.900]  That's official now.
[00:24:14.941 --> 00:24:19.403]  So that's my concern, long-term, is they allow this attack to happen.
[00:24:19.423 --> 00:24:22.965]  Netanyahu knew this Hamas-Hezbollah attack was coming.
[00:24:22.985 --> 00:24:25.986]  There's no doubt the Israeli government knew something big was about to happen.
[00:24:26.006 --> 00:24:27.387]  I don't think anybody denies that.
[00:24:28.367 --> 00:24:29.148]  They let it happen.
[00:24:31.462 --> 00:24:34.344]  So it's more severe without striking it before it gets off the ground.
[00:24:36.166 --> 00:24:39.909]  Obviously the attack's gonna come when most of the Jews aren't at work on the Sabbath.
[00:24:40.989 --> 00:24:44.172]  And then now Netanyahu's gonna be massively strengthened in Israel.
[00:24:46.093 --> 00:24:48.395]  In his decades off and on again being in control.
[00:24:48.415 --> 00:24:51.778]  Remember he was the leader when 9-11 happened.
[00:24:53.219 --> 00:25:00.064]  So just as 9-11 was bare minimum allowed to happen, this has been now allowed to happen and Israel's had its 9-11.
[00:25:01.969 --> 00:25:04.991]  Israel has not been attacked like this since the 1970s.
[00:25:05.251 --> 00:25:09.034]  So, all I'm saying is that needs to be investigated.
[00:25:09.894 --> 00:25:12.536]  I'm not saying Iran didn't fund it.
[00:25:14.277 --> 00:25:16.559]  I'm not saying there isn't radical Islamic terror.
[00:25:17.539 --> 00:25:19.501]  I'm not saying the attacks are good, they're bad.
[00:25:20.401 --> 00:25:25.745]  I'm saying 35,000 foot view, even mainstream news is like, how do the Israelis not catch this?
[00:25:26.621 --> 00:25:28.582]  Tens of thousands of people are about to attack you.
[00:25:29.263 --> 00:25:30.443]  They're running around getting ready.
[00:25:30.883 --> 00:25:34.826]  And nothing against the Muslims, but, well, the Iranians want to keep their mouth shut.
[00:25:35.286 --> 00:25:45.552]  But the Hamas folks, I mean, always, you know, they'll be fighting, videotaping it with their phone, you know, screaming Allah Akbar and just talking about it.
[00:25:45.592 --> 00:25:54.837]  I mean, remember when they actually had Al Qaeda and all those other permutations of it, ISIS attacking Syria.
[00:25:56.721 --> 00:26:00.764]  And they would shoot chemical weapons off to blame Assad, but still videotape it and brag about it.
[00:26:01.064 --> 00:26:08.129]  And so those false flags never worked against Assad because they would videotape themselves launching the attacks.
[00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:13.652]  So again, that was Shia.
[00:26:15.193 --> 00:26:18.716]  I mean, Sunni, not the Shiites.
[00:26:20.757 --> 00:26:25.300]  But it gets even more confusing because both groups will team up against the West or against Israel.
[00:26:27.026 --> 00:26:27.707]  At any time.
[00:26:28.808 --> 00:26:47.917]   So a lot is going on, a lot is happening, a lot is unfolding, but I want to pull back, not at a 35,000 foot view, but at a million foot view, and just see the whole earth there, and talk about the big picture, and why we predicted more war, more conflicts, because China's encircled Taiwan.
[00:26:48.017 --> 00:27:03.581]  China is a thousand miles away in the South China Sea that they've named, trying to take islands and ramming fishing boats and shooting at people that are right off the coast of their own country in the Philippines, trying to catch fish for a living.
[00:27:04.822 --> 00:27:12.283]  China's completely out of control, doing huge military drills around Taiwan.
[00:27:13.004 --> 00:27:14.324]  And so that's how this works.
[00:27:16.024 --> 00:27:42.934]   As we get pinned down in Ukraine, and as all of our munitions and weapons are being used there, now Hamas, Hezbollah team up, bare minimum, I think Hezbollah's running this, and roll this out, and you can hate Israel, I know that's fashionable, on the left and the right, And Israel definitely shouldn't get all the funding and, you know, Israel shouldn't have its spies spy on us and run back to Israel.
[00:27:42.974 --> 00:27:43.995]  And I have real issues with Israel.
[00:27:44.015 --> 00:27:45.256]  I have real issues with the UK.
[00:27:45.276 --> 00:27:46.277]  I have real issues with Canada.
[00:27:46.677 --> 00:27:52.082]  But I don't blame the people of Canada or the people of the UK or the people of... Germany has a horrible government that does terrible things.
[00:27:52.463 --> 00:27:53.524]  I don't blame the German people.
[00:27:53.744 --> 00:27:54.965]  I don't blame the Chinese people.
[00:27:55.886 --> 00:27:59.669]  But, I mean, Israel's under big pharma control, using people as guinea pigs.
[00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:02.292]  But that said, I don't support the destruction of Israel.
[00:28:02.693 --> 00:28:04.254]  Plus, Israel's not going anywhere.
[00:28:04.855 --> 00:28:07.337]  Israel has thousands of nuclear weapons.
[00:28:07.377 --> 00:28:10.120]  And I know Snopes will say I'm wrong, but they do.
[00:28:10.521 --> 00:28:12.923]  Okay, they've been caught, it's been leaked, they've had whistleblowers.
[00:28:13.684 --> 00:28:14.205]  It's a fact.
[00:28:14.865 --> 00:28:17.788]  They've been caught with their people stealing our nuclear secrets.
[00:28:17.848 --> 00:28:22.854]  So, my issue is we should treat Israel like any other ally.
[00:28:23.988 --> 00:28:26.030]  Because we can't trust our own federal employees.
[00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:27.611]  They spy on U.S.
[00:28:27.931 --> 00:28:28.732]  weapons engineers.
[00:28:29.052 --> 00:28:30.073]  Our government does.
[00:28:30.733 --> 00:28:32.695]  Our agencies have oversight over the FBI.
[00:28:33.215 --> 00:28:36.378]  And they catch the FBI agents all the time, you know, being spies for foreign governments.
[00:28:36.718 --> 00:28:38.679]  Why don't we just say, oh, Israel's off limits.
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.641]  Let Israel do whatever it wants.
[00:28:40.681 --> 00:28:42.602]  Let Israel spy on whoever they want.
[00:28:42.622 --> 00:28:43.943]  Let Israel sell U.S.
[00:28:43.963 --> 00:28:44.604]  secrets to China.
[00:28:45.184 --> 00:28:47.026]  I mean, no, Israel's got people just like we've got.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:55.525]  With that Harvard professor that ran their biology department reportedly getting indicted for selling secrets of biological warfare to China.
[00:28:56.206 --> 00:28:59.728]  So, I mean, I just say you can't trust any of these big governments.
[00:28:59.748 --> 00:29:02.010]  You can't trust any of these big globalist organizations.
[00:29:02.531 --> 00:29:09.556]  Israel was heavily involved with Jeffrey Epstein and MI6 and the CIA in a big sex honeypot pedophilia operation.
[00:29:09.796 --> 00:29:10.797]  And are governments corrupt?
[00:29:11.517 --> 00:29:16.462]  Our CIA's corrupt, the Mossad's corrupt, the British intelligence is fabulously corrupt.
[00:29:16.863 --> 00:29:20.407]  I mean, they pretty much taught America and the Israelis how to do all this.
[00:29:20.947 --> 00:29:22.949]  Of course, the Israelis have had spies for thousands of years.
[00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:28.856]  But I'm just saying, the modern pedophile use is a British intelligence specialty.
[00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:35.032]  And I guess Israel said, well, we'll just one-up you and we'll have Jeffrey Epstein make that look like child's play.
[00:29:35.092 --> 00:29:41.594]  So anybody being naive about Israel being this gallant, perfect little angel cake is full of it.
[00:29:42.114 --> 00:29:42.974]  Same thing with Iran.
[00:29:43.374 --> 00:29:47.576]  The mullahs kill people that don't wear a jib over their face.
[00:29:48.096 --> 00:29:49.596]  They oppress their population.
[00:29:49.616 --> 00:29:51.217]  Their population is the youngest in the world.
[00:29:51.897 --> 00:29:57.779]  They have internal polls that 70% are pro-America and don't want to be ruled by a theocracy.
[00:29:58.536 --> 00:30:03.178]  So, I don't like the Iranian leadership, and they're dangerous, and they can trigger World War III.
[00:30:03.578 --> 00:30:07.220]  And I don't worship the Israeli leadership, and they're out of control, too.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.101]  And our government's out of control, too.
[00:30:09.321 --> 00:30:10.982]  And the German government's out of control, too.
[00:30:11.242 --> 00:30:12.863]  And the British UK government's out of control.
[00:30:13.103 --> 00:30:14.463]  And the Australian government's out of control.
[00:30:14.483 --> 00:30:17.965]  So we need to stop letting governments hide behind people.
[00:30:18.005 --> 00:30:18.805]  It's like this Pope!
[00:30:19.206 --> 00:30:21.667]  Horrible world government, New World Order pusher.
[00:30:22.506 --> 00:30:30.391]  Promoting sexualization of children, attacking saying Europe's not just for Christians, and we should, you know, not fetishize Europe's Christian roots.
[00:30:30.451 --> 00:30:31.031]  That's a quote.
[00:30:32.092 --> 00:30:35.014]  And supporting anti-free speech, and supporting carbon taxes.
[00:30:35.274 --> 00:30:36.655]  This Pope is horrible!
[00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:39.736]  I don't hate Catholics, they're some of the best people I know!
[00:30:39.756 --> 00:30:42.738]  And they're under attack by the FBI and this Pope!
[00:30:43.539 --> 00:30:46.941]  So, I don't hate Catholics, I love Catholics, but I don't like this Pope!
[00:30:48.686 --> 00:30:50.608]  And I don't want to be enemies with Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:30:50.688 --> 00:31:00.095]  I don't want to say he's a horrible guy, but when he says, oh, we're using the Jewish population as guinea pigs for Pfizer and Moderna, and we're going to be the new center of the world for testing to see what works on our people.
[00:31:00.435 --> 00:31:01.736]  Hey, buddy, that's not good.
[00:31:04.919 --> 00:31:06.300]  So that's where I'm at here.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:10.963]  And the same thing with the Palestinians.
[00:31:11.874 --> 00:31:13.155]  They live in horrible squalor.
[00:31:13.175 --> 00:31:14.515]  They're getting bombed all the time.
[00:31:14.555 --> 00:31:15.675]  They're in a terrible situation.
[00:31:16.056 --> 00:31:18.897]  But they're used as a proxy by the Arab states against Israel.
[00:31:19.117 --> 00:31:22.438]  And I'm going to say it again to all the Israel haters that have a religion out of hating Israel.
[00:31:22.818 --> 00:31:25.839]  And then lying about me and claiming that I work for Israel.
[00:31:26.139 --> 00:31:27.660]  And then they fetishize it all.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:31.461]  And they claim all these people that aren't Jews are Jews.
[00:31:31.882 --> 00:31:34.082]  So they can say Jews are in all the key positions everywhere.
[00:31:35.203 --> 00:31:37.024]  Israel's not going anywhere.
[00:31:37.524 --> 00:31:39.184]  They have 2,000 nuclear weapons.
[00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:46.508]   So Why don't the Nazis out there look in the mirror and realize how stupid they are?
[00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:51.207]  Because they get really mad at me when I point out Klaus Schwab's dad and grandfather were Nazis.
[00:31:51.227 --> 00:31:57.369]  There's this weird eugenics-based social Darwin thing that's at the top.
[00:31:57.809 --> 00:32:05.013]  And I don't care whether it's the Israeli leadership, or the German leadership, or the UK leadership, or the Canadian leadership, or the US leadership, or any of it.
[00:32:05.353 --> 00:32:09.695]  At the top, they're eugenicists, globalists, transhumanists that think we're all a bunch of animals.
[00:32:10.035 --> 00:32:11.615]  Yuval Noah Harari is Jewish.
[00:32:12.576 --> 00:32:14.997]  He's the main spokesman for the World Economic Forum.
[00:32:15.017 --> 00:32:16.918]  We're going to talk about him in a moment with an expert.
[00:32:17.785 --> 00:32:20.826]  And his quotes, go read them, is, the human era is over.
[00:32:21.746 --> 00:32:23.106]  Humans will be extinct soon.
[00:32:24.506 --> 00:32:26.046]  AI will be God and rule you.
[00:32:26.907 --> 00:32:30.847]  Well, Hitler just said that the future's not these groups.
[00:32:31.667 --> 00:32:32.488]  That was bad enough.
[00:32:32.808 --> 00:32:35.568]  This guy's up there saying the future's not human.
[00:32:36.368 --> 00:32:38.128]  And the end of the human era is here.
[00:32:38.629 --> 00:32:40.089]  And that we'll be extinct by 2050.
[00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:46.290]  Well, that sounds as bad a Hitler as it gets, but he's a chicken-neck gay Jewish guy.
[00:32:47.190 --> 00:33:00.899]  So it's like, well, he's a chicken neck, you know, Jewish guy, so he's non-threatening, you know, like, like, like Tim Cook runs giant slave camps, the worst in China, using Uyghur slaves, but he's gay and he wears a turtleneck and has a little neck.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.581]  Like, well, he's non-threatening and talks with a lisp.
[00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:10.466]  Oh, Sergey Brin and all these guys, Larry Page, they're like nerds, so they're non-threatening.
[00:33:10.926 --> 00:33:12.307]  They know that, folks.
[00:33:12.787 --> 00:33:16.990]  And you want to compare them to Hitler, they say the future is not human.
[00:33:20.411 --> 00:33:25.532]  Hitler just said the future is Aryan, and he's going to take over and kill everybody else, and that's terrible!
[00:33:26.832 --> 00:33:28.513]  But you see how all the other racial groups act.
[00:33:29.293 --> 00:33:30.953]  Every other group has their supremacist.
[00:33:31.013 --> 00:33:35.054]  Every other group organizes and says, we're the best, we're the kings, we're the chosen people.
[00:33:35.234 --> 00:33:36.134]  Everybody does that!
[00:33:37.435 --> 00:33:43.196]  Except Christians, that unifies everybody under Christ, no matter what color you are, and the Big Ten.
[00:33:44.215 --> 00:33:45.596]  That's one big reason to be a Christian.
[00:33:46.217 --> 00:33:49.780]  And it's the most successful societies on earth are Christian societies.
[00:33:51.341 --> 00:33:52.883]  All right, I'm going to reset here.
[00:33:52.903 --> 00:33:53.964]  This is all very, very upsetting.
[00:33:53.984 --> 00:33:55.405]  We've got a special guest about to join us.
[00:33:55.445 --> 00:33:56.106]  I appreciate him.
[00:33:56.446 --> 00:34:01.611]  He was already supposed to be on, but we got started late because it was so much to collate and so much to get this emergency broadcast.
[00:34:02.051 --> 00:34:05.754]  I've got a lot of other angles I want to hit, but Trump is blaming Iran.
[00:34:06.535 --> 00:34:07.716]  Israel's blaming Iran.
[00:34:08.217 --> 00:34:12.849]   Hamas is the main group that runs the government in The Gaza Strip.
[00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:15.052]  There's millions of people there in the Gaza Strip.
[00:34:16.254 --> 00:34:17.435]  It is a hellhole.
[00:34:18.417 --> 00:34:20.179]  They routinely get bombed by the Israelis.
[00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:21.361]  They bomb the Israelis back.
[00:34:21.621 --> 00:34:22.983]  It's a 75-year war.
[00:34:23.103 --> 00:34:23.804]  It's terrible.
[00:34:24.445 --> 00:34:25.366]  It needs to be fixed.
[00:34:26.528 --> 00:34:28.470]  But this is definitely not going to fix it.
[00:34:29.031 --> 00:34:42.497]  And taking hostages and targeting civilians is not good, but let's just be honest, and I'm not endorsing what they did, I'm not endorsing the Israelis dropping 1,000 and 2,000 pound bombs on apartment buildings and killing women and children in mass.
[00:34:43.037 --> 00:34:52.450]   So if you want to call Hamas or Hezbollah terrorists, and I think targeting civilians is terrible, Well then, what is Israel doing?
[00:34:52.790 --> 00:35:00.513]  What is Obama doing when he'd blow up a whole Arab or Muslim wedding and kill a hundred-something people and say, well, we killed the one guy we wanted so it's collateral damage?
[00:35:01.534 --> 00:35:09.397]  So before we criticize Hamas or Hezbollah, we have to criticize our own government and we have to criticize the Israeli government.
[00:35:09.457 --> 00:35:10.318]  And I get war.
[00:35:11.138 --> 00:35:22.571]   Look, my dad's dad flew over You know, Italian cities, that was mainly in his missions out of North Africa, bombing what they thought were German targets, but they killed a lot of Italians, folks.
[00:35:22.831 --> 00:35:23.811]  Let's get that straight.
[00:35:24.332 --> 00:35:27.213]  So, I mean, I'm not here judging anybody in these wars.
[00:35:27.733 --> 00:35:29.053]  War is a terrible thing.
[00:35:29.313 --> 00:35:31.774]  He did some things into Germany, too, but only a few missions.
[00:35:32.155 --> 00:35:35.596]  So my grandfather flew around dropping bombs on German cities, okay?
[00:35:36.376 --> 00:35:40.197]  And on Italian cities, mainly on the West Coast when the U.S.
[00:35:40.217 --> 00:35:41.498]  invasion went in there, his air cover.
[00:35:43.197 --> 00:35:47.080]  My other grandfather didn't do many missions until his plane broke and he crash-landed and almost got killed.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:47.560]  He was lucky.
[00:35:47.881 --> 00:35:48.741]  He only did a few missions.
[00:35:48.781 --> 00:35:51.864]  But the point is that he was a fighter pilot.
[00:35:53.365 --> 00:35:58.229]  But the point is that that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:58.689 --> 00:36:04.153]  So I don't judge Jerry Jones, my grandfather, under orders dropping 500-pound bombs on German houses.
[00:36:05.114 --> 00:36:11.499]  But I'm just saying, don't call Hezbollah and them running into people's houses and shooting men, women, and children.
[00:36:12.119 --> 00:36:14.900]  Terrorist, unless you're going to call what everybody else is doing.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.941]  And I'm not defending any of it.
[00:36:16.341 --> 00:36:18.162]  I think it's terrible the Russians are shelling.
[00:36:18.642 --> 00:36:20.703]  And the Ukrainians are shelling.
[00:36:21.203 --> 00:36:22.163]  And they're just indiscriminately.
[00:36:22.203 --> 00:36:23.524]  But that's what war is.
[00:36:23.864 --> 00:36:26.365]  And that's why Sean Penn and the left and all of them are wrong.
[00:36:26.685 --> 00:36:27.826]  We want to end war.
[00:36:28.246 --> 00:36:29.527]  We want to stop war.
[00:36:29.867 --> 00:36:31.608]  We want this to not go on anymore.
[00:36:31.968 --> 00:36:33.008]  This is not good.
[00:36:33.428 --> 00:36:34.949]  And it's getting out of control.
[00:36:35.269 --> 00:36:36.490]  And it dehumanizes us.
[00:36:37.401 --> 00:36:44.789]  But the real war is cutting off our energy, our fertilizer, our food, and it's killing already tens of millions of people extra a year.
[00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:54.640]  So, let's talk about the real war that isn't with guns and bullets, coming up with Kent Heaven-Lively, and we're going to talk about this book that is so timely.
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.902]  We were still writing this just three weeks ago.
[00:36:57.853 --> 00:36:59.153]  It's 400 pages long.
[00:37:00.014 --> 00:37:01.054]  It just went to print.
[00:37:01.234 --> 00:37:02.755]  Our warehouse is now full of these books.
[00:37:03.235 --> 00:37:04.755]  Available at infowarestore.com.
[00:37:04.795 --> 00:37:07.956]  If you want a signed copy, you want to send it to number one, amazon.com.
[00:37:08.957 --> 00:37:11.618]  It's the companion book to The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[00:37:12.838 --> 00:37:16.879]  Let's hear a couple of these little Alex Jones promo predictions, because people really like these.
[00:37:16.899 --> 00:37:19.500]  They go viral and show folks how we're way ahead of the curve.
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:27.003]  Then we'll come back with Kent Heckin-Lively, who was one of the main researchers on this, and my co-author, forwarded by Stephen K. Bannon.
[00:37:28.191 --> 00:37:39.828]  And he took literally 40-50 hours of recordings with me and dozens of meetings with me on the phone and scores of meetings in person.
[00:37:40.909 --> 00:37:43.173]  The other book's really good and really informative and it's a quick read.
[00:37:45.506 --> 00:37:50.107]  Three, four times the work, I would say, go into it than The Great Reset and War for the World.
[00:37:50.147 --> 00:37:51.928]  This is a more powerful book.
[00:37:52.508 --> 00:37:55.189]  The other one's important, shows you the enemy is, what they want to do.
[00:37:55.669 --> 00:38:00.630]  This one shows the latest information on the enemy and then how to stop them and how to not destroy the world.
[00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:10.613]  And it gets into the pedophile rings and Mossad and MI6 and CIA and pedophile rings and Jeffrey Epstein and outright Satanism and AI and the wars.
[00:38:11.053 --> 00:38:20.015]  And Ukraine, and the surveillance, and the tyranny, and the Patriot Act, and how to stop it, and the Great Renaissance, and how only God can bring us together to do it.
[00:38:20.396 --> 00:38:30.298]  The Great Awakening at Infowarsstore.com for a signed or unsigned copy, or you can get it at Amazon.com to send it to number one, which is so important.
[00:38:30.318 --> 00:38:32.139]  The last book was in the number one as well.
[00:38:32.439 --> 00:38:34.339]  So I apologize to Kent that I got started late.
[00:38:34.699 --> 00:38:35.800]  That was mainly my fault.
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.721]  And we will go to him here in a few minutes.
[00:38:39.741 --> 00:38:40.241]  We'll be right back.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.122]  Your film is now ready to be shown.
[00:38:45.343 --> 00:38:47.385]  Biological and chemical attacks are imminent.
[00:38:47.845 --> 00:38:48.866]  They're preparing us.
[00:38:48.926 --> 00:39:01.035]  They're going to create a crisis because they know that they can't deal with a real political backlash and the restructuring and the reforming and getting back to the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[00:39:01.075 --> 00:39:03.557]  Biological attack is imminent!
[00:39:03.717 --> 00:39:05.518]  We know the government's planning terrorism.
[00:39:05.738 --> 00:39:08.099]  We know the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to blow up airliners.
[00:39:08.299 --> 00:39:11.400]  If you do it, we're going to blame you, because we know who's up to it.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.661]  Or if you let some terrorist group do it, like the World Trade Center, we know who to blame.
[00:39:15.981 --> 00:39:17.982]  If any terrorism comes, it's from this government.
[00:39:18.342 --> 00:39:26.340]   And if there was an outside threat, like a bin Laden, who was a known CIS in the 80s, He's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[00:39:26.481 --> 00:39:29.602]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.
[00:39:30.222 --> 00:39:33.684]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute.
[00:39:35.085 --> 00:39:37.866]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[00:39:37.986 --> 00:39:41.228]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:39:41.308 --> 00:39:44.269]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:39:44.509 --> 00:39:47.251]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:39:49.628 --> 00:40:00.214]  Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, everything that's in the other documents.
[00:40:00.274 --> 00:40:12.921]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines and the hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[00:40:15.302 --> 00:40:17.203]  You're not going to be able to go to the ballgames anymore.
[00:40:19.192 --> 00:40:21.494]  You're not gonna be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:40:21.514 --> 00:40:24.656]  You're not gonna be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:40:25.416 --> 00:40:25.937]  It's scary.
[00:40:29.312 --> 00:40:40.519]  They're preparing to release bioweapons, claim that they're naturally occurring, and then use that as the cover for civil emergency societal control, crackdowns on free speech.
[00:40:40.619 --> 00:40:46.858]   A bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a global problem
[00:40:46.858 --> 00:40:52.298]   and the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[00:40:52.298 --> 00:41:00.658]  Last year we put this book out.
[00:41:01.008 --> 00:41:02.430]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:04.232]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[00:41:04.812 --> 00:41:08.056]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[00:41:08.596 --> 00:41:09.477]  The Great Awakening.
[00:41:09.577 --> 00:41:13.421]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:41:13.842 --> 00:41:15.483]  This is such a powerful book.
[00:41:15.904 --> 00:41:17.565]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[00:41:18.166 --> 00:41:24.491]  The latest developments, how to stop them, and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[00:41:24.811 --> 00:41:26.352]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[00:41:26.372 --> 00:41:28.474]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.
[00:41:28.734 --> 00:41:33.537]  You can get signed or unsigned copies of the book at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:41:33.838 --> 00:41:35.179]  This is a historic book.
[00:41:35.499 --> 00:41:36.860]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:44.866]  This is next-level information, and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself to the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[00:41:45.126 --> 00:41:51.510]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to InfoWarsTore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:52.910]  This is going to go to number one.
[00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:54.251]  I want to thank you for your support.
[00:41:54.431 --> 00:41:55.232]  It's a powerful book.
[00:41:55.272 --> 00:41:56.272]  Get yours now.
[00:41:56.272 --> 00:42:00.991]   By the middle of September, that the new policy is being written, you all have to wear
[00:42:00.991 --> 00:42:05.352]  masks again and so will airport employees.
[00:42:06.057 --> 00:42:08.318]  Mask mandates are officially back.
[00:42:08.478 --> 00:42:16.101]  We know the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to blow up airliners, Baltimore Sun, or if you let some terrorist group do it, like the World Trade Center, we know who to blame.
[00:42:16.382 --> 00:42:20.443]  And if there was an outside threat, like a bin Laden, who was a known CIS in the 80s.
[00:42:20.623 --> 00:42:24.865]  This group and its leader, a person named Osama bin Laden, he's the boogeyman they need.
[00:42:25.225 --> 00:42:27.706]  We're looking at a giant war in February right now.
[00:42:27.966 --> 00:42:29.866]  I predict the Russians are going to roll in.
[00:42:29.886 --> 00:42:30.826]  They're already there.
[00:42:30.846 --> 00:42:31.526]  They're going to roll in.
[00:42:32.107 --> 00:42:35.367]  With attacks across Ukraine, which is the size of Texas.
[00:42:35.627 --> 00:42:36.868]  It really was the Iraqis.
[00:42:36.888 --> 00:42:38.788]  That's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq.
[00:42:39.388 --> 00:42:40.389]  What a beautiful setup.
[00:42:40.569 --> 00:42:46.050]  American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq.
[00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:54.317]  Get ready, because we've had enough after this white supremacist or whoever it is they, you know, set up, went and did this horrible event.
[00:42:54.337 --> 00:42:59.702]  You want to stop these folks, you got to be basically eyes and ears, and they're going to hit at night.
[00:42:59.823 --> 00:43:01.924]  They're going to start at about 10 o'clock at night.
[00:43:02.185 --> 00:43:05.448]  A storm of gunfire raining down upon an innocent crowd.
[00:43:05.748 --> 00:43:06.569]  It started at 10.08 p.m.
[00:43:08.413 --> 00:43:22.846]  Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite and it gets into controlling food, the environment, total control, martial law, millions dead, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, biometric IDs, to travel, to live.
[00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:25.567]  Read what these monsters are planning for you.
[00:43:26.088 --> 00:43:37.450]  A bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a global problem, and the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:40.271]  It may not be this year, but this is the globalist plan.
[00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:44.711]   So if you start seeing a bunch of people die in China, and you see it, oh, a thousand dead,
[00:43:44.711 --> 00:43:48.230]   a hundred thousand dead, and then by the time you hear it's a hundred thousand dead,
[00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:51.031]   it'll be here on these airplanes and you won't have anywhere to go.
[00:43:51.031 --> 00:43:57.590]  No.
[00:43:57.582 --> 00:43:59.243]  Yes, there have been corrupt empires.
[00:43:59.383 --> 00:44:00.484]  Yes, they manipulate.
[00:44:00.624 --> 00:44:02.285]  Yes, there are secret societies.
[00:44:02.645 --> 00:44:04.747]  Yes, there have been oligarchies throughout history.
[00:44:05.067 --> 00:44:21.819]  And yes, today, in 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World Order, pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society, open borders, total and complete tyranny.
[00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:25.531]  We're human beings are absolutely worthless.
[00:44:26.091 --> 00:44:35.035]  There's six and a quarter plus billion of us, and the globalists have said it many times, there's too many of us, we're causing a problem, we need to be culled at the tune of 80%.
[00:44:35.195 --> 00:44:50.777]   It's amazing to talk about that, but it's the globalists, the UN, their own public statements, and they've convinced a lot of liberals And elitist conservatives and others that by going along with this that we're intelligent members of society.
[00:44:51.517 --> 00:44:54.718]  It's the ultimate Malthus worldview.
[00:44:54.898 --> 00:45:02.079]  It is this radical, virulent form of social Darwinism.
[00:45:02.179 --> 00:45:04.920]  It's the excuse of tyrants.
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:19.761]   And by creating open borders where there's no national sovereignty and only global bodies that control all the resources, By centralizing and socializing health care, the state becomes God, basically, when it comes to your health.
[00:45:19.901 --> 00:45:26.901]   and then by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues upon us, we then basically get shoved into their system.
[00:45:26.901 --> 00:45:38.901]   All right, it's 1.24 Central Time, emergency Saturday, October 7th transmission.
[00:45:38.901 --> 00:45:40.301]  (dramatic music)
[00:45:40.407 --> 00:45:51.823]  Kent Heckin-Lively is an amazing author and researcher and helped me do the book, The Great Reset, and now the new book, The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalist and Launching the Next Great Renaissance.
[00:45:52.504 --> 00:45:53.265]  It's on pre-order.
[00:45:53.425 --> 00:45:54.266]  It's in our warehouse.
[00:45:54.327 --> 00:45:55.168]  It starts shipping on the 20th.
[00:45:56.089 --> 00:46:02.870]  You can order it at Amazon.com, it says number one, or get signed copies as a fundraiser to keep us on air at InfoWarshaw.com, and we need your support.
[00:46:03.631 --> 00:46:06.071]  We have unsigned copies there as well.
[00:46:06.731 --> 00:46:09.032]  All right, Kent, wow, what a day to get you on.
[00:46:09.052 --> 00:46:14.753]  You were supposed to be on an hour ago, but I had to get more crew in here to do research and prepare for this.
[00:46:15.213 --> 00:46:23.535]  I was going to tape a show that we were going to air with you on Monday, but wow, this is all going on and unfolding the situation.
[00:46:24.435 --> 00:46:30.443]  In Israel, with Hamas, with obviously Hezbollah's Iranian backing going on.
[00:46:30.523 --> 00:46:34.788]  You were there earlier live, listening to me the last 15 minutes, when I was giving my perspective.
[00:46:34.808 --> 00:46:40.315]  Before we dive into the book, and we cover some of this in the book, what is your historical view of the situation?
[00:46:42.166 --> 00:47:01.300]  You know, it's very much in tune with what you say, Alex, which is people in countries want to just go and live their lives in peace and prosperity, and these crazy rulers of ours keep provoking these conflicts in which the regular people suffer.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:10.487]  Yeah, so the Palestinians are suffering, the Israelis are suffering, and it seems like soon the Iranian people are going to be suffering, if I read the tea leaves correct.
[00:47:11.748 --> 00:47:15.051]  And you know, this gets into a wider conflict with Iran.
[00:47:15.091 --> 00:47:25.200]  So I'm just so happy to be a part of your mission of getting this message out to the public, which is a true populist message.
[00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.822]  Let's take the power away from the elites.
[00:47:28.403 --> 00:47:38.349]   Let's put it back into the hands of the people, because we the people can live peaceably with With each other and figure out how to create a better world.
[00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:47.412]  We just need to get rid of these people, these elitists, these globalists who believe that they can control us and force us to fight with each other.
[00:47:48.312 --> 00:48:01.752]   And, you know, in these times, which I know people are scared, What I would say to the InfoWars audiences is ask yourself, what's the bravest thing you can do today?
[00:48:01.872 --> 00:48:04.173]  What is the most constructive thing you can do?
[00:48:04.873 --> 00:48:10.356]  I think it's to get your new book, The Great Awakening, our new book, The Great Awakening.
[00:48:10.956 --> 00:48:35.104]   Read it and understand it because these globalists can only exist When we are unaware of what they do, if we are able to understand their plans, and that's why it was so great to work with you on this, because, you know, even though I've written a number of books, as you can see behind me, about various aspects of corruption, I didn't understand all of the things.
[00:48:35.144 --> 00:48:39.265]  I mean, it was such an education working with you, getting your perspective on things.
[00:48:39.765 --> 00:48:42.729]  You know, we've got over 400 references in the book.
[00:48:43.229 --> 00:48:53.441]  So this book is really a deep dive for maybe people who like to, you know, read more than maybe watch the videos or they want to go deeper on it.
[00:48:53.881 --> 00:49:16.033]   So I just, I feel like in these times in which people are so scared, you know, Connect to God, connect to the sacred source, and say, all right, what can I do calmly, with a rational mind, in order to be helpful to the world, rather than just to be panicked?
[00:49:17.513 --> 00:49:20.615]  You wrote Ending Plague and some of Mickiewicz's books with her.
[00:49:21.075 --> 00:49:30.180]  That was really the blueprint early on in the pandemic that Mickey Willis and others used to just totally break out, and that also Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:49:30.481 --> 00:49:34.123]  used as a research blueprint to then write The Real Anthony Fauci.
[00:49:34.163 --> 00:49:46.710]   So, when you helped me write just one chapter on COVID, it's the most concise, boiled down, most knowledgeable info of its origin, what it really does, what the shot does, you're going to find.
[00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:51.793]  And we probably had, let's not exaggerate, what do you think?
[00:49:51.853 --> 00:49:54.015]  Probably 60 interviews over the phone.
[00:49:54.975 --> 00:50:04.780]   We probably did Seven, eight, nine, ten sessions in person, sometimes for five, six hours at a time at my home or in my office when you came here to Austin.
[00:50:05.401 --> 00:50:10.964]  And so, this wasn't just a bunch of recordings of me and me sending you links like The Great Reset and All Over the World.
[00:50:11.024 --> 00:50:12.065]  It's an excellent primer.
[00:50:12.685 --> 00:50:17.728]  This book is a couple hundred pages thicker and a super fast read and covers the waterfront.
[00:50:17.928 --> 00:50:23.131]   I mean, sure, when I approved the manuscript and it was done, Three weeks ago and went to print immediately.
[00:50:23.171 --> 00:50:24.051]  Now it's in our warehouse.
[00:50:24.431 --> 00:50:28.213]  Talk about quick turnaround with the great folks at Skyhorse, the First Amendment juggernaut.
[00:50:29.394 --> 00:50:39.659]  I thought it was a great book, but once I got it in last week and started signing copies of it and getting it ready to ship out, and I re-read it over the last five days, I am really proud of this book.
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:43.201]  So great job, Kent, helping me vet all my research.
[00:50:44.642 --> 00:50:47.644]  I just thought the top of my head said four times the work on this book than the last one.
[00:50:48.845 --> 00:50:51.627]  Contradict me if it's twice, five times, what you really think.
[00:50:52.307 --> 00:50:58.872]  And then I made a lot of crazy claims to you, and you said 99% of them you could actually find were actually accurate.
[00:50:58.892 --> 00:51:05.056]  And then the few times I just kind of twisted something or flipped it and got it backwards, then we were able to find out what I was actually saying.
[00:51:05.616 --> 00:51:06.957]  What was the process like of the book?
[00:51:06.977 --> 00:51:07.778]  And let's talk about what's in it.
[00:51:09.372 --> 00:51:21.104]  Yeah, so what was great, and I really want your audience to know this, I never found you telling me a single thing that I couldn't find a source that kind of went along with that.
[00:51:21.564 --> 00:51:30.796]   Now the only like three to four percent of the time You know, there was something that I didn't trust about the source, but I was really clear that you had heard it.
[00:51:31.276 --> 00:51:35.800]  And, you know, when people ask me, what's it like writing for Alex Jones?
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:49.250]  I say, the man has an incredible memory, recall, you know, I'll say something like, well, gee, you know, really get me this David Rockefeller, China relationship.
[00:51:49.310 --> 00:52:07.417]   And you'll go, Well, Kent, you know, go to the New York Times, 1973, you know, January, and suddenly I typed it in and I find, you know, David Rockefeller talking about what a wonderful place China is, even though they just went through the Cultural Revolution where they killed millions.
[00:52:08.238 --> 00:52:11.801]  And so it was really what was great for me.
[00:52:11.922 --> 00:52:15.305]  Well, he endorsed Mao Zedong and said, we need to be like this.
[00:52:15.345 --> 00:52:15.545]  Yeah.
[00:52:16.949 --> 00:52:25.591]  Yeah, and so every time you would tell me something that I'd go, hey, I wonder if that's a little bit too far.
[00:52:25.951 --> 00:52:31.572]  Like the one on Nygaard and them having women have babies so they could drain their juices and inject them in themselves.
[00:52:32.913 --> 00:52:43.125]   Yeah, and so every time you would tell me something, you know, I would Just think to myself a little bit, okay, maybe that's a little bit on the edge.
[00:52:43.165 --> 00:52:53.029]  Maybe that's a different interpretation than I would make, but I would go to the source and I'd go, no, I think Alex is 100% rock solid on it.
[00:52:53.109 --> 00:53:01.572]  And so, you know, what I was able to do because I'm trained as a lawyer, so I want to go back first and then I'll go into analysis.
[00:53:01.852 --> 00:53:07.074]  And I know in media, you want to get people's attention, so you may do it a little bit differently.
[00:53:07.874 --> 00:53:19.019]  For those who are more sort of like, well, give me the facts first and then give me the analysis, they may enjoy this a little bit more, but you know, I'm never going to build a media empire like you are.
[00:53:19.159 --> 00:53:19.860]  Oh, enough about me.
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:26.202]  The point is, what a great collaboration, one of many to come, because you just basically fact-checked and organized the last book.
[00:53:26.242 --> 00:53:28.344]   This one, you What would you say?
[00:53:28.544 --> 00:53:32.426]  Did this book four times the work, or that's just a guesstimation?
[00:53:33.827 --> 00:53:35.908]  I would say easily four times the work.
[00:53:36.568 --> 00:53:37.249]  Well, what do you think?
[00:53:37.289 --> 00:53:37.769]  Five times?
[00:53:40.711 --> 00:53:47.695]  You know, it's difficult to say because, you know, the first book was I think just a little under two.
[00:53:47.715 --> 00:53:48.896]  Well, we wrote a lot of chapters.
[00:53:48.936 --> 00:53:49.656]  We decided to scrap.
[00:53:49.676 --> 00:53:52.078]  I mean, we did a lot of... I'm really proud of this book.
[00:53:53.806 --> 00:53:54.426]  Yeah.
[00:53:54.526 --> 00:54:04.070]  And so I think the depth of the research and how much I went into things, you know, I'd say four to five times the work, you know, it's about two and a half times the length.
[00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:07.271]  But I think it's just so much more detailed.
[00:54:07.852 --> 00:54:13.594]  And, you know, I really wanted to hit things so that people would understand the military industrial state.
[00:54:14.162 --> 00:54:24.255]  How is the deep state, you know, over 60 or 70 years gone from something that we may have said, gee, this sounds like a good idea at the beginning of the Cold War.
[00:54:24.815 --> 00:54:30.643]  But, you know, as Reagan warned, once you build something in government, it becomes eternal.
[00:54:31.083 --> 00:54:38.643]   And so we have this government surveillance, military industrial state, and it's just gone
[00:54:38.643 --> 00:54:39.643]  crazy.
[00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:42.202]  And let me address that.
[00:54:42.202 --> 00:54:45.963]   Last week, Homeland Security officially said, "We're looking at all Trump supporters as
[00:54:45.963 --> 00:54:48.523]  potential terrorists, and we think that's dangerous.
[00:54:48.523 --> 00:54:51.802]   We've been ordered to do it," literally targeting a giant political movement.
[00:54:51.802 --> 00:54:56.403]   We talk about how they set up the police state for Russia in the Cold War, then it was for
[00:54:56.403 --> 00:54:59.922]   radical Islam under 9/11 and now it's completely swung around against us.
[00:55:00.175 --> 00:55:01.596]  That's a major chapter of the book.
[00:55:01.956 --> 00:55:09.841]  Let's talk about what's in these chapters, because, folks, when I tell you I'm proud of this book, this is an incredible book, plus it keeps us on air with your support.
[00:55:09.861 --> 00:55:11.922]  So do you want to walk through the chapters with people, maybe?
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:19.044]  You know, you've got all the copies of the book and I don't have them yet.
[00:55:19.084 --> 00:55:23.428]  So pull out a chapter you like to talk about.
[00:55:23.488 --> 00:55:25.891]  First off, Bannon did an incredible intro.
[00:55:25.931 --> 00:55:27.072]  His intro is powerful.
[00:55:27.912 --> 00:55:30.375]  Chapter one, the threat of artificial intelligence.
[00:55:31.616 --> 00:55:37.041]  This really, in just one chapter, gives you the boil down of what AI is and where it's going.
[00:55:38.548 --> 00:55:51.534]  And you know, the AI chapter is really interesting for me because to get that perspective that Elon Musk and who was it who was saying like, you know, calling people speciesist?
[00:55:51.574 --> 00:55:52.374]  Was it Tim Cook?
[00:55:55.436 --> 00:55:59.838]  It was Larry Page to Elon.
[00:55:59.898 --> 00:56:00.238]  Yeah.
[00:56:01.358 --> 00:56:17.540]   And just to find, you know, it's so crazy to have people like Larry Page Getting into an argument with Elon Musk calling, you know, silicon-based life is equal to our life, and you're a speciesist.
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:20.701]  And this is 12 years ago!
[00:56:20.801 --> 00:56:24.522]  Yeah, and it's abundantly documented.
[00:56:24.602 --> 00:56:33.584]   It's not just coming from the mind of Alex Jones, it's coming from books that are published, articles that are out there, and you say to yourself, Who are these crazy people?
[00:56:34.044 --> 00:56:38.106]  And I interrupted you, I interrupted you because we've collaborated so much, it's firing all my synapses.
[00:56:38.506 --> 00:56:41.307]  Start over what a species is and what we say in the chapter.
[00:56:41.967 --> 00:56:43.268]  It's mainly their own statements.
[00:56:43.308 --> 00:56:46.129]  I mean, this is big, saying, screw carbon-based life form.
[00:56:46.369 --> 00:56:49.211]  I mean, imagine if Hitler said, I want to get rid of all carbon-based life forms.
[00:56:49.231 --> 00:56:49.591]  Screw it.
[00:56:49.851 --> 00:56:51.512]  Yuval Harari says, that's all over.
[00:56:51.852 --> 00:56:52.952]  That's beyond Hitler.
[00:56:52.972 --> 00:56:53.913]  But it's like, oh, they're liberals.
[00:56:53.993 --> 00:56:54.453]  It's OK.
[00:56:54.653 --> 00:56:59.235]  They're declaring the end of all like parrots and kitty cats and dogs and blue whales.
[00:56:59.295 --> 00:57:01.416]  I mean, this is bigger than just anti-human.
[00:57:02.805 --> 00:57:11.712]  Yeah, you know, you talked about the word speciesist and you encouraged me to go into a deep dive onto the creation of this word speciesist.
[00:57:11.772 --> 00:57:20.879]  And, you know, I find it comes from PETA and, you know, then the academics who are doing it have questionable connections to the intelligence agencies.
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:26.564]  And you just find yourself going like, why do I, am I always getting this idea?
[00:57:26.704 --> 00:57:41.536]   Oh, you know, and, you know, one of the things that was just so amazing and, you know, We had profiled Yuval Noah Harari in the previous book, and we go into him again at the beginning, and he talks about this creation of this global useless class.
[00:57:42.057 --> 00:57:53.484]   Well, when people like me and you who've read history, Read, you know, somebody using language like that, you know, all of the bells and whistles go off.
[00:57:53.504 --> 00:57:54.965]  This is early Nazi thought.
[00:57:54.985 --> 00:58:01.808]  And there's actually a German expression that the Nazis used, which was life, life unworthy of life.
[00:58:02.924 --> 00:58:16.748]  And that's how they said, you know, OK, we can kill these groups, you know, starting first with disabled children, then going after their political enemies and then going after the Jews and gypsies and homosexuals and, you know, all this other sort of stuff.
[00:58:17.268 --> 00:58:30.887]   And so when we hear language like a global useless class and other people take it as useless eaters, Well, what the heck do you do with useless eaters?
[00:58:31.368 --> 00:58:32.528]  You know, they're useless.
[00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:37.652]  So, you're removing them from humanity that we care about.
[00:58:37.692 --> 00:58:38.913]  You've already dehumanized them.
[00:58:38.933 --> 00:58:40.114]  You've already said they're garbage.
[00:58:41.435 --> 00:58:43.597]  Yeah, and you're setting them up in the ghetto.
[00:58:43.817 --> 00:58:50.762]  And, you know, one of the things that just has really bugged me over the past couple days is what Hillary Clinton said.
[00:58:51.303 --> 00:58:56.472]   And I think that this gets to the difference Between us and them.
[00:58:56.552 --> 00:59:05.118]  Now, I hate to use that expression, the difference between us and them, but it's really accurate in this case.
[00:59:05.758 --> 00:59:11.062]  What she said of MAGA extremists, okay, that's how she puts it.
[00:59:11.723 --> 00:59:16.846]  She said, maybe there needs to be a formal deprogramming of cult members.
[00:59:17.747 --> 00:59:20.309]  I find that absolutely chilling.
[00:59:20.429 --> 00:59:26.123]   That separates the MAGA people From the rest of American society.
[00:59:26.143 --> 00:59:27.764]  And here's what I say to liberals.
[00:59:27.844 --> 00:59:46.658]  For those liberals who are terrified of Alex Jones, we will never submit you to formal deprogramming, but we will write books with hundreds of references for you to check.
[00:59:47.459 --> 00:59:56.009]   And we kindly suggest that you read this book So that we could have an informed discussion on it.
[00:59:56.890 --> 01:00:00.593]  Remove the hysteria from the conversation.
[01:00:01.114 --> 01:00:02.715]  That's what this book is about.
[01:00:02.775 --> 01:00:05.658]  This is about removing the hysteria.
[01:00:06.139 --> 01:00:07.180]  You can read it.
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.202]  We quoted extensively.
[01:00:10.353 --> 01:00:12.034]  And then let's have a conversation.
[01:00:12.194 --> 01:00:14.435]  That's what Americans are supposed to do.
[01:00:14.996 --> 01:00:17.077]  That is Western civilization.
[01:00:17.097 --> 01:00:28.364]  This move to cut down on debate and discussion between people of goodwill is anti-human, anti-Western.
[01:00:28.744 --> 01:00:32.946]  It's actually anti-life, for God's sakes.
[01:00:33.006 --> 01:00:35.328]  You know, they don't even like carbon-based life forms.
[01:00:35.368 --> 01:00:37.129]  They want us all to be silicon-based.
[01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:43.924]  And the beautiful part is, whether it's Elon Musk or Tucker Carlson or Joe Rogan, they suddenly get this.
[01:00:44.804 --> 01:00:49.825]  And they just change their perspective to see that it's anti-life, anti-carbon.
[01:00:49.845 --> 01:00:52.466]  And once you do that, it really does feel alien.
[01:00:52.486 --> 01:01:01.669]  I'm not saying aliens run this, but what does Harari, what does Klaus Schwab, what does all these top globalists say?
[01:01:01.709 --> 01:01:03.690]  They say, I don't believe in God yet.
[01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:08.530]  We're going to be gone.
[01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:09.411]  We're going to be gone.
[01:01:10.692 --> 01:01:18.896]  Yeah, and that's what was really interesting about working with you on The Great Reset, was I got to read all these books.
[01:01:19.316 --> 01:01:27.761]  And you know, with my background as a writer, I'm always aware that at some point the writer has to show his hand.
[01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:33.833]  The writer has to tell you, here's what I believe, here's what I'm trying to convince you of.
[01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:40.535]  And it took me two and a half books of reading Noval Harari in order to find what he wanted.
[01:01:40.775 --> 01:01:53.979]  And he talked about, isn't it going to be great when we can combine with humans and we can be sexless, non-breeding cyborgs who can live forever?
[01:01:54.619 --> 01:02:02.525]   And you know, I don't know about you, but Sure, I'd love eternal life, but no sex for eternity?
[01:02:02.946 --> 01:02:03.847]  This is hell!
[01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:05.689]  Don't let me have that!
[01:02:06.249 --> 01:02:14.278]  And so, you know, what I find is, these people, you just have to listen to the bad guys, because they'll give it away.
[01:02:14.318 --> 01:02:31.550]   And I think that that's What I really come away appreciating about you is all your broadcasts are informed by an extensive amount of reading of these documents that these evil globalists have put out.
[01:02:32.050 --> 01:02:42.061]   And so, you know, I really encourage people Take a look at what Alex is saying, because it's based on his own deep research.
[01:02:42.101 --> 01:02:50.633]  And that's why, really, it was so great to work with you, because I could always trust that I would find what you told me to go looking for.
[01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:52.015]  And that's just chapter one.
[01:02:54.077 --> 01:03:00.201]  It just goes on and on and on, and you want a boil-down, folks, that's cutting-edge.
[01:03:00.642 --> 01:03:04.004]  Because unfortunately, most people talking about AI aren't reading what the globalists say it is.
[01:03:04.024 --> 01:03:08.567]  They're just telling you, oh, it's a fun thing, oh, it's going to get rid of you, but why do they want to get rid of us?
[01:03:08.907 --> 01:03:15.912]  Chapter 2, Mao is in charge of the Democratic Party, and political violence is bad, except when it's directed at patriots, conservatives, and Christians.
[01:03:17.699 --> 01:03:27.851]  Yeah, that was great because, you know, you told me that I should look at one of Mao's speeches that he gave during the beginning of the Cultural Revolution.
[01:03:28.411 --> 01:03:32.336]  And if you read it, it's almost like a blueprint of what's happening in America today.
[01:03:32.716 --> 01:03:38.443]  You know, the Cultural Revolution was not put forward by the older generation.
[01:03:38.983 --> 01:03:45.384]  What they did was they turned middle school students, high school students, and college students against their parents.
[01:03:45.504 --> 01:03:47.905]  And they let them be as vicious as possible.
[01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:57.106]  And so what Mao talked about is you need to break the relationships that people have with each other.
[01:03:57.206 --> 01:03:59.467]  So you need to break the family relationships.
[01:03:59.927 --> 01:04:05.448]  You also had the weird, you know, getting rid of gender.
[01:04:06.281 --> 01:04:08.362]  In Mao's China.
[01:04:08.862 --> 01:04:11.824]  So, you know, men and women would dress exactly the same.
[01:04:11.844 --> 01:04:16.466]  Well, romantic love is one of the most powerful forces in the universe.
[01:04:16.926 --> 01:04:18.527]  Just like family love.
[01:04:18.947 --> 01:04:21.548]  Love of God is a powerful force.
[01:04:21.568 --> 01:04:41.323]   So, when you go to that 35,000 foot view and you go, wait a minute, why are all the forces in the modern Democratic Party Interested in separating parents from their children because they're supposed to trust their teachers more than their parents.
[01:04:41.723 --> 01:04:42.583]  No, no, no.
[01:04:42.703 --> 01:04:43.324]  I'm sorry.
[01:04:43.824 --> 01:04:45.725]  That's not the way human society goes.
[01:04:46.265 --> 01:04:57.485]   They want to separate us from each other because they want people not to talk to their friends Who may have slightly different opinions, who may be more conservative.
[01:04:57.505 --> 01:05:02.986]  That's really what's going on, because you see nobody on the conservative side saying, don't talk to a liberal.
[01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:17.889]  You know, it's like, well, talk to liberals and, you know, show them how much we have in common, how the elite are, you know, gaming the system to make us hate each other and, you know, breaking the relationship with God.
[01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:28.780]  And, you know, which I would say, and I think we're in agreement on this, that, you know, it's, like, God first, family, you know, and, you know, each other.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.321]  It's God, family, country.
[01:05:33.542 --> 01:05:35.403]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:36.043 --> 01:05:40.485]  And so, you know, it's kind of funny because you're supposed to be so radical.
[01:05:41.198 --> 01:05:46.160]  But as I put this together, I say, this is so frickin' traditional.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:55.104]  You know, this is like an Eisenhower Republican, you know, book on what we should have and what we should, you know, or a founding father's document.
[01:05:55.144 --> 01:06:05.089]  Like, let's put a good society together that has a better chance of being, you know, more just than any other society in human history.
[01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:13.454]   And, you know, we're looked at, you know, Hillary Clinton is saying we need to be Deprogrammed in some formal system.
[01:06:13.534 --> 01:06:14.576]  Well, screw you!
[01:06:16.257 --> 01:06:19.120]  And now we've only gotten to the second chapter.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:23.164]  We're taping this on Saturday with this giant war that's erupted in Israel.
[01:06:23.865 --> 01:06:28.910]  But this is, like you said, the million-foot view, the 35,000-foot view to understand what's going on.
[01:06:29.931 --> 01:06:31.132]  So let's go to Chapter 3.
[01:06:31.352 --> 01:06:39.803]   You are being modified against your will And then we talk about end to what end, that the modification, the transhumanism is happening now.
[01:06:40.465 --> 01:06:43.551]  And we're only up to page 50 at this point.
[01:06:46.485 --> 01:07:05.372]  Yeah, well, one of the things that I enjoyed learning most about was the mouse utopia experiments from the 1960s, in which they decided to create this utopia for mice, you know, free from predators, free from population food pressures.
[01:07:06.072 --> 01:07:12.554]   And what happened is It led to the collapse of the mouse colony.
[01:07:12.734 --> 01:07:22.479]  It was really interesting because you see in the mouse utopia experiments a model of what's happening in our cities today.
[01:07:23.199 --> 01:07:35.726]   So what they found is that if you give the mice unlimited food and you crowd them together, A whole lot of different behaviors start to evolve.
[01:07:36.266 --> 01:07:42.930]  So, the mouse societies will usually have an alpha male who's got a breeding harem, okay?
[01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:50.374]  Well, usually in the wild, what happens is the alpha male defends himself from challengers.
[01:07:50.735 --> 01:07:53.916]  Challengers lose, they go off, they may create their own colonies.
[01:07:54.077 --> 01:07:55.617]  That's what happens, okay?
[01:07:55.637 --> 01:07:57.318]  So, the alpha male has dominance.
[01:07:58.786 --> 01:08:03.950]  The females can have their children, care for their children.
[01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:06.212]  The mouse colony survives.
[01:08:06.653 --> 01:08:13.699]  Well, what happens is there's too much fighting because the males who lose can't leave.
[01:08:14.756 --> 01:08:17.477]  Okay, so they keep attacking the males.
[01:08:17.958 --> 01:08:19.798]  They keep bothering the females.
[01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:22.940]  The females can't raise their children.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:24.541]  They often kill their children.
[01:08:24.561 --> 01:08:31.164]  Then what also happens is some mice decide to drop out of society.
[01:08:31.224 --> 01:08:33.965]  They just don't participate anymore.
[01:08:33.985 --> 01:08:36.386]  So that's the explosion of homeless.
[01:08:38.903 --> 01:08:40.066]  It's the explosion of the homeless.
[01:08:40.386 --> 01:08:49.964]  You've also got these mice that they call the beautiful ones who will spend all day preening themselves and have no interest in sex.
[01:08:50.862 --> 01:08:57.868]  And so, you know, I think of like Instagram and how everybody wants to be beautiful on Instagram and, you know, all of these platforms.
[01:08:58.208 --> 01:09:02.351]  And you're saying like, okay, that's great that you have, you know, 100,000 followers.
[01:09:03.192 --> 01:09:05.734]  Do you have five people in your life that you talk to?
[01:09:05.794 --> 01:09:09.237]  Do you lay down in bed next to somebody you love?
[01:09:09.257 --> 01:09:10.938]  Do you have children?
[01:09:10.958 --> 01:09:13.920]  Are you a contributing member of your society?
[01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:24.668]   And, you know, when I looked at those mouse utopia experiments and compared it You know, I lived in San Francisco for eight years and loved it when I was in my 20s.
[01:09:25.049 --> 01:09:26.470]  I wanted to be a city guy.
[01:09:26.490 --> 01:09:27.630]  I wanted to be an urban guy.
[01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:31.193]  But, you know, no way in hell you can get me to live in a city right now.
[01:09:31.413 --> 01:09:32.454]  Well, let's talk about this.
[01:09:33.174 --> 01:09:45.723]  Mice, and I'm not saying we're like mice in our spirit, but we're the closely associated in test of drugs and psychologically and culturally, not the chimpanzees and not the great apes like we've always heard.
[01:09:46.103 --> 01:09:48.905]  We're the closest to mice and pigs.
[01:09:49.525 --> 01:09:54.406]  Whether it's drugs they test on us, or behaviorally, or what we do.
[01:09:55.026 --> 01:09:59.187]  And so they found that humans were already behaving like the mice.
[01:09:59.207 --> 01:10:01.388]  But the mice only have like a five-year life cycle.
[01:10:01.408 --> 01:10:02.948]  We've got a 75-year life cycle.
[01:10:03.389 --> 01:10:08.770]  And so what they predicted in the 60s would happen to our culture, all of this is now happening exactly as it did with the mice.
[01:10:10.635 --> 01:10:19.097]  Yeah, and it's just remarkable to see, you know, how many of these things are happening in our society.
[01:10:19.277 --> 01:10:23.618]  And, you know, they're happening primarily in democratic run cities.
[01:10:24.558 --> 01:10:28.819]  And you find yourself saying like, you know, okay, I can understand, you know, tolerance.
[01:10:28.859 --> 01:10:33.280]  No, but it's traditionalism and staying with what we're supposed to do is a shield.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.060]  And when you get rid of traditionalism, you're wide open, you collapse.
[01:10:37.761 --> 01:10:38.001]  Yeah.
[01:10:39.805 --> 01:10:53.274]   When I, you know, I live close to San Francisco and, you know, every day on the radio I hear people talking about San Francisco and they'll say, how can anybody I think that this is a good situation.
[01:10:53.314 --> 01:10:58.099]  I mean, you know, they put together an app, which was called the Crap Map of San Francisco.
[01:10:58.479 --> 01:11:00.762]  You know, avoid human feces on the street.
[01:11:01.122 --> 01:11:06.447]  Well, what happened is, you know, the entire map turned brown and they canceled it.
[01:11:06.848 --> 01:11:09.530]  I mean, it's just failure after failure.
[01:11:10.251 --> 01:11:20.459]   And, you know, Granted, we can all do stupid things from time to time, but you have to wonder, when you keep having these excessive failures, is this all part of a plan?
[01:11:20.479 --> 01:11:23.403]  And, you know... And then people ask, why do you live?
[01:11:24.246 --> 01:11:24.826]  Close to that.
[01:11:24.866 --> 01:11:26.047]  Well, your family goes way back.
[01:11:26.067 --> 01:11:27.408]  I've talked to generations there.
[01:11:28.348 --> 01:11:29.309]  You've got a winery.
[01:11:29.369 --> 01:11:33.671]  You've got family land out in the hills.
[01:11:33.732 --> 01:11:34.572]  You're from there.
[01:11:34.632 --> 01:11:37.234]  It's where your ancestors came.
[01:11:37.614 --> 01:11:39.135]  People ask, why are you in Austin?
[01:11:39.195 --> 01:11:43.177]   My ancestors literally started Waterloo, that is Austin.
[01:11:43.597 --> 01:11:45.038]  And I do have to leave it, basically.
[01:11:45.078 --> 01:11:50.762]  It's become San Francisco, or any San Francisco in just a few years, because they want a post-industrial world.
[01:11:50.822 --> 01:11:51.522]  It's a formula.
[01:11:51.803 --> 01:11:55.285]  They're bringing down civilization, the Great Reset, so they can build back better.
[01:11:55.525 --> 01:11:57.106]  And that's also in the book as well.
[01:11:57.366 --> 01:12:01.369]  We've got to move quick here, because this is so important, and I want people to know how great the book is.
[01:12:01.429 --> 01:12:04.031]  Available at Infowarsware.com or Amazon.com.
[01:12:05.049 --> 01:12:06.110]  So we did Chapter 3.
[01:12:07.011 --> 01:12:08.572]  Let's go into Chapter 4.
[01:12:09.233 --> 01:12:13.776]  They want you to be a teenager on an allowance, and that's just the beginning.
[01:12:14.117 --> 01:12:16.078]  The social credit score, the AI takeover.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:24.866]  Yeah, so that was great because, you know, I've been fascinated by the, you know, digital banking and digital bank currency.
[01:12:25.486 --> 01:12:29.169]  And, you know, I always look for the plan, okay?
[01:12:29.209 --> 01:12:34.508]   You know, I think that they You know, we've got a lot of dangled, shiny objects in front of us to get us mad.
[01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:39.559]  And you know, the challenge is really to go deeper and say, what's the plan here?
[01:12:41.195 --> 01:12:46.139]  You know, and you got to break it down easy to people in a way that they can understand.
[01:12:46.219 --> 01:12:52.143]  And so I think we've all had the experience of being a teenager and, you know, maybe our parents put us on an allowance.
[01:12:52.624 --> 01:12:57.948]  And then maybe we thought, hey, you know, I'll get a job and then I'll, you know, I'll have some extra money.
[01:12:57.968 --> 01:13:00.470]  And that makes you more mature.
[01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:07.195]  And then hopefully you go to college or you go to trade school or you go to work and you start earning your own money.
[01:13:07.415 --> 01:13:09.797]  And with that greater money comes greater freedom.
[01:13:10.277 --> 01:13:21.690]  And you understand that actually the founding of our country was because there were wealthy people like George Washington who put his own money to funding the Continental Army.
[01:13:21.971 --> 01:13:26.155]  And so it's not just money as power, but money as freedom.
[01:13:27.016 --> 01:13:42.550]   And you understand at a deeper level why when that When the elites create financial insecurity, you know, when what is it like 50 to 60% of the people in the world can't in the United States can't put together $1,000 for an emergency?
[01:13:45.891 --> 01:13:48.654]  That means you're hanging on by your fingertips.
[01:13:49.475 --> 01:13:53.339]  And so what do people do who are hanging on by their fingertips?
[01:13:53.639 --> 01:13:54.960]  They don't make waves.
[01:13:55.461 --> 01:14:05.451]  And so this is, you know, an argument that's being made a lot, which is why does it seem the powerful are interested in creating a cycle of dependency on us?
[01:14:05.711 --> 01:14:12.629]   Because, you know, when you're a parent and you've got a kid on an allowance, Well, you've got control over them.
[01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:16.152]  You can say, do what I want or you don't get your allowance.
[01:14:16.632 --> 01:14:17.973]  And they're doing the same thing.
[01:14:17.993 --> 01:14:25.377]  And, you know, in this example, it's much darker because, you know, your parent wants the best for you.
[01:14:25.757 --> 01:14:30.420]  The parent is hoping when you're a teenager, you live to your 20s.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.141]  You don't do something stupid.
[01:14:32.381 --> 01:14:33.101]  Well, that's right.
[01:14:33.141 --> 01:14:37.424]  People say all the time that globalists don't care about us.
[01:14:37.444 --> 01:14:37.844]  No, they do.
[01:14:37.663 --> 01:14:40.063]  financial instability for people.
[01:14:40.063 --> 01:14:43.184]  They don't have your best interest at heart.
[01:14:43.184 --> 01:14:46.262]  They, they want their power.
[01:14:46.262 --> 01:14:50.224]  And, you know, the parent wants you to survive.
[01:14:50.224 --> 01:14:53.543]  These globalists just want their control.
[01:14:53.543 --> 01:14:53.983]  Well, that's right.
[01:14:53.983 --> 01:14:55.862]  People say all the time, the globalists don't care about us.
[01:14:55.862 --> 01:14:56.702]  No, they do.
[01:14:56.702 --> 01:15:00.182]   They want to sabotage and hurt people to make us more controllable
[01:15:00.182 --> 01:15:01.943]  to phase us out of their own words.
[01:15:02.903 --> 01:15:09.224]   And so just like people didn't take Hitler serious, Hitler was a amateur compared to
[01:15:09.224 --> 01:15:10.063]  Klaus Schwab.
[01:15:10.063 --> 01:15:13.823]   And you all know Harari and what they're calling for a total end of carbon based
[01:15:13.823 --> 01:15:15.583]  life, claiming their gods.
[01:15:16.422 --> 01:15:18.163]  Ray Kurzweil said, I don't believe in God yet.
[01:15:18.644 --> 01:15:22.467]  Again, this is a declaration of war against humanity.
[01:15:23.067 --> 01:15:25.306]  and just telling us, "Hey, it's all over.
[01:15:25.306 --> 01:15:27.146]  You're falling, you're bad."
[01:15:27.146 --> 01:15:29.985]  And they're offering something a trillion times worse.
[01:15:29.985 --> 01:15:32.266]  And I say that from their perspective.
[01:15:32.266 --> 01:15:36.546]   They project their own hate of themselves, we talk about that in the book, onto us.
[01:15:36.546 --> 01:15:38.306]  Now, I think we're amazing.
[01:15:38.306 --> 01:15:43.626]   Our heights are incredible, our lows are horrible, but I like the human process, see, we can decide.
[01:15:43.689 --> 01:15:48.192]  Humans are the only animal that controls its own environment, because we're not an animal.
[01:15:48.212 --> 01:15:48.932]  We're made in the image of God.
[01:15:48.952 --> 01:15:52.614]  We can look at what we envisioned 1,000 years ago or 200 years ago, we've built.
[01:15:53.314 --> 01:15:54.295]  And so they know that.
[01:15:54.315 --> 01:15:59.218]  They want us to decide that, oh, you're overpopulated, you're bad, turn off your life forces, roll over and die.
[01:15:59.278 --> 01:16:00.218]  No, we're not going to do it, Kent.
[01:16:00.758 --> 01:16:02.039]  And so that's why the book is so important.
[01:16:02.059 --> 01:16:03.540]  I want to challenge viewers and listeners.
[01:16:04.957 --> 01:16:06.478]  But the bare minimum, it keeps us on air.
[01:16:07.159 --> 01:16:08.180]  And it funds the operation.
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:09.060]  It's a historical book.
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:10.521]  It's something you're not supposed to have.
[01:16:10.581 --> 01:16:12.463]  It's something the censors don't want you to have.
[01:16:13.043 --> 01:16:14.224]  And the other book was great.
[01:16:14.264 --> 01:16:15.405]  It was a number one bestseller.
[01:16:15.825 --> 01:16:20.329]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is light years better than The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[01:16:20.449 --> 01:16:21.470]  It is The Great Awakening.
[01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:23.511]  It's not just detailing the enemy operations.
[01:16:23.592 --> 01:16:26.254]  It's detailing how to defeat them.
[01:16:26.294 --> 01:16:32.058]  So I have a little four or five minute promo video that I shot last week that kind of breaks this down.
[01:16:32.418 --> 01:16:40.384]   And let's race through The other, I think there's 10 or 11 more chapters we haven't talked about, and you're only skimming the surface here.
[01:16:40.404 --> 01:16:46.408]  I mean, this is deep, hardcore research, but it's not giving you a headache like academics.
[01:16:47.368 --> 01:16:53.572]  We give our view, we show their statement, we show where they said it, we tie it together with the next chapter and back to the last chapter.
[01:16:54.153 --> 01:16:55.654]  And I thought the book was great.
[01:16:56.425 --> 01:17:11.949]  Well, when I got them in last week, they came in on Monday, the 18-wheeler of books, and I pulled a dozen out to show up at the shipping center, and I took them home, and I told my wife, you can't mail these out to family until the 20th, and I sat down, and I was like, well, I'm just going to read one chapter.
[01:17:12.049 --> 01:17:14.290]  Read four that night, even though I was already tired.
[01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:15.831]  And it went by quick.
[01:17:15.851 --> 01:17:18.094]  I was like, I just read like four huge chapters in two hours.
[01:17:18.554 --> 01:17:20.016]  Then the next night, read another three or four.
[01:17:20.076 --> 01:17:21.577]  And then I finished it this morning.
[01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:24.400]  And I was just like, I'm really proud of this.
[01:17:25.001 --> 01:17:25.942]  And I'm proud of the other book.
[01:17:26.402 --> 01:17:27.043]  It's a great book.
[01:17:27.563 --> 01:17:30.727]  But in fact, it's kind of sad that I thought that book was great.
[01:17:30.767 --> 01:17:31.788]  Now I don't think it's that good.
[01:17:32.048 --> 01:17:32.729]  I'm not putting it down.
[01:17:33.129 --> 01:17:34.971]  But I think, be honest with us before we go to this clip.
[01:17:35.712 --> 01:17:37.254]  How do you feel about this book compared to the last?
[01:17:38.877 --> 01:17:49.727]  You know, what was really funny is I've been working with the same editor at Skyhorse for probably 10 books, and she is the most reserved person I've ever met.
[01:17:49.787 --> 01:18:02.159]  You know, you put your blood, sweat and tears into a book, you send it to your editor, you know, you get back all the notes and you say, you know, you want to know, OK, I see all the comments, but what did you think about it?
[01:18:02.199 --> 01:18:06.703]   And so finally, I said, Caroline, What do you think of this book, you know?
[01:18:07.623 --> 01:18:09.504]  You never tell me, like, what you think!
[01:18:10.384 --> 01:18:14.645]  And she wrote me back and she goes, I think this book is going to set the world on fire.
[01:18:15.546 --> 01:18:17.466]  And I was just like, holy crap!
[01:18:18.467 --> 01:18:20.067]  You're the most reserved person I know!
[01:18:21.268 --> 01:18:28.610]  Well, this is live right now, but we're going to take a few clips of things you say and put them up front when this airs again on Monday to the full broadcast.
[01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:41.003]   So let's put a few, let's put that clip up front right there, because yeah, because again, I wanted to have everything in this book, and we got really frustrated, and we had to cut some chapters, add some chapters, we rewrote a lot of stuff.
[01:18:42.063 --> 01:18:49.426]  I said to you, I said, Kent, months ago, I said, too much of this is just recordings of me, and then you just prove what I say and put a citation on it.
[01:18:49.886 --> 01:18:56.709]  I said, I want you, because I'm impressed with the stuff you've had a bigger influence on, this is not like the last book where you were just organizing what I said.
[01:18:56.749 --> 01:19:04.672]   I said, I want to bring your brain in to organize this, so this book, That's why I said I want to put you as a co-author, not a ghostwriter, because you are a co-author on this.
[01:19:05.252 --> 01:19:11.956]  And I think you made the book much more powerful because you organized all this chaos I'm looking at and helped really distill it down.
[01:19:12.076 --> 01:19:13.176]  So, congratulations.
[01:19:15.037 --> 01:19:15.618]  Thank you very much.
[01:19:15.638 --> 01:19:16.858]  It was a pleasure to work with you.
[01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:18.839]  I know it was frustrating to make you throw a hat.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.301]  I think at one point the book was up at like 700 pages long.
[01:19:23.755 --> 01:19:27.699]  And sure, reading a transcript of what I've said is important and it has links and it proves it.
[01:19:28.319 --> 01:19:31.442]  But what we did together, I mean, we worked intensely on this.
[01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:40.390]  I mean, I think some chapters we probably, like, I mean, we probably had like five, six meetings per chapter sometimes.
[01:19:41.711 --> 01:19:41.891]  Yeah.
[01:19:43.228 --> 01:19:46.172]  All right, well, ladies and gentlemen, it is The Great Awakening.
[01:19:46.232 --> 01:19:47.373]  Here's a little breakdown of it.
[01:19:47.753 --> 01:19:52.499]  We're going to come back, finish up talking about the book, and hit some of the other news that's unfolding.
[01:19:52.759 --> 01:19:54.982]  And there's some big surprises coming up next week.
[01:19:55.022 --> 01:19:56.544]  And you're watching this live on Saturday.
[01:19:57.064 --> 01:20:00.148]  We're going to air this, big parts of it, for an hour on Monday.
[01:20:00.708 --> 01:20:03.452]  I won't be in studio, and it's not because I'm on vacation.
[01:20:04.619 --> 01:20:07.301]  When people think I'm on vacation, I'm not on vacation.
[01:20:07.782 --> 01:20:16.208]  My wife and daughter might be with me when I go on the road and they're off at the museum or the planetarium or the aquarium or at the beach if we're by the beach.
[01:20:17.129 --> 01:20:19.491]  I'm not doing that, folks, other than maybe an hour a day with them.
[01:20:20.012 --> 01:20:22.734]  I'm behind the scenes doing a lot.
[01:20:22.754 --> 01:20:23.675]  It's kind of like Fight Club.
[01:20:24.355 --> 01:20:30.058]  And I don't want to, it's cooler than Fight Club because we're not common, it's blowing up Wall Street, but it's the real Fight Club.
[01:20:30.178 --> 01:20:34.640]  And let's just say this, my work off-air is just as important as the on-air work.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:44.484]  I've really reached, by the grace of God, the Lord works mysterious ways, a point now where, and the enemy knows this, they've got our phones tapped and stuff, but the public hasn't quite figured it out yet.
[01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:54.274]  I don't deserve this, but I'm now recognized as kind of the Tyler Durgan behind the scenes with some of the biggest names out there.
[01:20:54.755 --> 01:20:58.877]  And a lot of that's going to start coming out because we're not launching Operation Chaos.
[01:20:59.337 --> 01:21:02.599]  We're launching Operation Renaissance, Operation Great Awakening.
[01:21:03.019 --> 01:21:09.503]  And because of all this, I've convinced a lot of people that now know I'm right to listen to me about how to challenge this and how to fight this.
[01:21:09.523 --> 01:21:14.546]  So all glory goes to God, spiritually, temporally to the audience, the crew, and everybody else.
[01:21:17.566 --> 01:21:20.168]  If they kill me, I didn't commit suicide like Matt Gaetz just said.
[01:21:20.188 --> 01:21:23.831]  And if they blow my airplane up, I didn't do it either, because I'm not dumb.
[01:21:23.931 --> 01:21:26.093]  We're hurting them bad right now.
[01:21:26.173 --> 01:21:27.054]  All glory goes to God.
[01:21:27.374 --> 01:21:28.215]  So here's a quick breakdown.
[01:21:28.235 --> 01:21:29.456]  We'll come right back with Kent Hickenlooper.
[01:21:29.476 --> 01:21:29.796]  Stay with us.
[01:21:30.977 --> 01:21:35.801]  Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot just oppose the globalists and their operations.
[01:21:36.501 --> 01:21:40.121]   Yes, it's important to expose them, to track their criminal operations,
[01:21:40.121 --> 01:21:44.121]  their depopulation, their pedophilia, their satanic agenda.
[01:21:44.121 --> 01:21:50.320]   But we also need to then offer our own agenda or our own plan for the future.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:56.301]   Unlike them, we're not gonna make people via totalitarian systems follow our agenda,
[01:21:56.301 --> 01:22:00.780]   but we should promote an alternate agenda to what they're doing.
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:07.980]   So in this book that came out in 2022, it became a number one worldwide bestseller,
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:10.079]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:22:09.756 --> 01:22:13.218]  We lay out the enemy's own statements, their own plans.
[01:22:14.159 --> 01:22:15.840]  It is the blueprints to the Death Star.
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:19.962]  And that book is available signed or unsigned at infowarestore.com.
[01:22:20.823 --> 01:22:24.825]  But now we're talking about the new book, The Great Awakening.
[01:22:25.926 --> 01:22:31.850]  The Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:22:32.691 --> 01:22:33.811]  And that's what this book does.
[01:22:34.592 --> 01:22:35.292]  It is 400 pages long.
[01:22:37.461 --> 01:22:45.123]  I would say that 60% of it is the latest enemy operations and how they're operating and what makes them tick and how to stop them.
[01:22:45.903 --> 01:22:57.466]  But then 40% or so is what we can build, different ideas, different systems to counter the dystopia that they are setting up.
[01:22:58.206 --> 01:22:59.627]  Now, we're going to send this to number one.
[01:22:59.687 --> 01:23:00.747]  You're going to send this to number one.
[01:23:01.327 --> 01:23:04.008]  They are so pissed about this book, they're already attacking it.
[01:23:05.026 --> 01:23:12.448]  But I want to encourage all of you to go to MFORWARDSPORT.COM and get a signed copy that's a fundraiser to keep us on air and a historical memento.
[01:23:13.388 --> 01:23:17.209]  And also get unsigned copies to give to your friends, your family, and your neighbors.
[01:23:17.249 --> 01:23:22.830]  Because this book is a major piece of history.
[01:23:23.150 --> 01:23:26.451]  So let me go over some of what's in the book.
[01:23:27.051 --> 01:23:29.612]  We'll go ahead and go to an overhead shot and I'll show you the back of the book.
[01:23:30.973 --> 01:23:35.656]  A Tucker Carlson quote, a Bill Maher quote, a Joe Rogan quote, a Stephen K Manning quote, a Mickey Willis quote.
[01:23:36.197 --> 01:23:37.998]  And these quotes are absolutely dead on.
[01:23:38.358 --> 01:23:41.680]  Tucker Carlson says Alex Jones is often mocked for his flamboyance.
[01:23:42.181 --> 01:23:46.023]  But the truth is, he's been a far better guide to reality in recent years.
[01:23:46.664 --> 01:23:50.666]  In other words, a far better journalist than, say, NBC News.
[01:23:51.247 --> 01:23:51.787]  Bill Maher.
[01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:53.368]  Alex Jones gets to speak.
[01:23:53.588 --> 01:23:54.449]  Everybody gets to speak.
[01:23:55.387 --> 01:23:56.187]  Here's Joe Rogan.
[01:23:56.567 --> 01:24:02.589]  Alex Jones is one of the most misunderstood people in the world, and he's been right about a lot of S-H-T.
[01:24:03.389 --> 01:24:04.189]  Stephen K. Bannon.
[01:24:04.469 --> 01:24:10.211]  For more than 20 years, no populist figure has been more of a bayonet in the back of the deep state than Alex Jones.
[01:24:10.631 --> 01:24:13.512]  Stephen K. Bannon, who also wrote the foreword to the book.
[01:24:14.417 --> 01:24:18.138]  Mickey Willis, award-winning documentary filmmaker, reaches hundreds of millions.
[01:24:18.478 --> 01:24:22.599]  Mainstream media is wrong the vast majority of the time, yet they are never held accountable.
[01:24:22.939 --> 01:24:27.539]  Alex Jones is right the vast majority of the time, and yet he is silenced and persecuted.
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:31.020]  The book, ladies and gentlemen, is unbelievable.
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:38.842]  And it was researched by the great researcher Kent Hechen-Lively, who double-checked everything I said, who fact-checked it all.
[01:24:39.362 --> 01:24:46.442]   It has a big document section in the back where we show you everywhere
[01:24:46.442 --> 01:24:47.992]  the sources come from.
[01:24:47.992 --> 01:24:53.912]   You need the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:24:53.912 --> 01:24:59.431]   Today with the foreword by Stephen K. Bannon, let's go to a document cam shot and give people
[01:24:59.431 --> 01:25:06.391]   a first look at this book. There's the Great Awakening and it goes into the chapters.
[01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:07.751]  Ford by Stephen Bannon.
[01:25:08.131 --> 01:25:09.471]  A bayonet to the back of the deep state.
[01:25:10.212 --> 01:25:12.312]  Chapter 1, the threat of artificial intelligence.
[01:25:12.332 --> 01:25:18.274]  Chapter 2, Mao is in charge of the Democratic Party, and political violence is bad except when it's directed at Alex Jones.
[01:25:18.594 --> 01:25:20.955]  Chapter 3, you're being modified against your will.
[01:25:21.495 --> 01:25:23.356]  That's the GMO genetic engineering.
[01:25:24.249 --> 01:25:29.290]  Chapter 4, they want you to be a teenager on an allowance and that's just the beginning.
[01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:31.471]  The social credit score, the ESG's.
[01:25:32.011 --> 01:25:34.151]  Chapter 5, the eternal war of tyrants.
[01:25:34.171 --> 01:25:35.992]  Chapter 6, the war machine.
[01:25:36.032 --> 01:25:38.132]  Chapter 7, the deep state makes us move.
[01:25:38.392 --> 01:25:41.293]  Chapter 8, the education of Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan and others.
[01:25:41.593 --> 01:25:43.493]  That's the big inside baseball section.
[01:25:43.533 --> 01:25:44.133]  Very powerful.
[01:25:44.454 --> 01:25:45.794]  Chapter 9, Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:25:46.454 --> 01:25:50.617]  We're in the field of the globalists, Draculas, but even worse because they prey on their own children.
[01:25:50.837 --> 01:25:52.838]  They murder their own children and drink their blood.
[01:25:53.119 --> 01:25:53.859]  Totally proven.
[01:25:53.919 --> 01:25:54.520]  I name names.
[01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:56.101]  You cannot make this up.
[01:25:57.261 --> 01:25:59.583]  Chapter 10, the COVID lies in deception.
[01:25:59.603 --> 01:26:02.465]  Chapter 11, selling your soul to Hollywood and the CIA.
[01:26:02.525 --> 01:26:04.887]  Chapter 12, combat tactics for victory.
[01:26:04.947 --> 01:26:06.328]  Chapter 13, the final battle.
[01:26:06.628 --> 01:26:09.850]  Conclusion, how you know you're winning and more.
[01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:15.434]  The Great Awakening, exclusively available at infowarestore.com, a piece of history.
[01:26:15.914 --> 01:26:18.395]  All right, Kent, you've done a great job.
[01:26:18.415 --> 01:26:22.157]  I've been jumping in a lot because we're all on the same mind here.
[01:26:22.197 --> 01:26:24.018]  We wrote this book together.
[01:26:23.858 --> 01:26:28.617]   Find her on sign right now at infowarestore.com and I thank you for all your support.
[01:26:28.617 --> 01:26:45.737]  We are all part of the Great Awakening.
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:49.103]  Or maybe we'll go at 1.30 on Monday into the fourth hour.
[01:26:50.034 --> 01:26:55.958]  Whatever much time it takes, air this on Monday, guys, because I'm going to be on an airplane going somewhere for a big interview on Monday.
[01:26:55.978 --> 01:26:56.558]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:26:57.079 --> 01:26:59.200]  We've got a lot of other big developments after that.
[01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:02.702]  The week after, the planets are politically aligning, so pray for us.
[01:27:03.203 --> 01:27:04.704]  The enemy definitely knows we're over the target.
[01:27:05.524 --> 01:27:07.245]  So Ken, other comments about this book?
[01:27:07.265 --> 01:27:09.647]  I mean, we really can't hype this book enough.
[01:27:10.247 --> 01:27:14.190]  And again, I was proud of it until I read it in the hardcover as the actual book.
[01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:22.656]  Altogether, some of the stuff is like Shakespearean that you wrote off of what I said.
[01:27:23.096 --> 01:27:25.058]  The way we riff off each other is like jazz.
[01:27:25.258 --> 01:27:26.099]  I'm very proud of this.
[01:27:27.338 --> 01:27:55.707]   Yeah, well it's kind of funny you mentioned jazz because I think of that same thing because you'll say something and you know you have your personality and I have a little different personality but what we both share is a love for truth and so I'm figuring out how do I talk in a way that in a book That is, you know, engaging to the reader because books are something different than just, you know, a broadcast.
[01:27:56.027 --> 01:27:58.329]  It's really a mind-to-mind sort of thing.
[01:27:58.449 --> 01:28:01.752]  So, you know, you have to be working at a very high level.
[01:28:01.812 --> 01:28:03.353]  You have to use imagery.
[01:28:03.774 --> 01:28:07.377]  You have to say to yourself, okay, where is the reader getting tired?
[01:28:07.796 --> 01:28:11.956]  Where do I need to maybe throw a little bit of levity here?
[01:28:11.956 --> 01:28:16.395]   Where do I need to back it up and make a comparison to something else?
[01:28:16.395 --> 01:28:19.956]   Exactly, because most of my research is reading raw bills or documents,
[01:28:19.956 --> 01:28:22.116]  and it makes me upset.
[01:28:22.116 --> 01:28:26.116]  This, I had fun reading the book.
[01:28:26.116 --> 01:28:32.515]   Yeah, and it's kind of strange to say, OK, we're talking about people who want to destroy the world,
[01:28:32.515 --> 01:28:34.315]  and yet it's also a fun read.
[01:28:34.315 --> 01:28:43.555]   Because what you realize is these evil people are really terrible planners for society.
[01:28:43.204 --> 01:28:49.088]  It's not just that their plans are bad, it's that they don't work with human beings.
[01:28:49.188 --> 01:28:52.951]  The reason they need the secrecy is because their plans suck!
[01:28:54.213 --> 01:28:56.394]  It's not good for human beings.
[01:28:56.494 --> 01:29:02.475]  And when you tell human beings about this plan, like, you know, you all know Harari.
[01:29:02.976 --> 01:29:09.958]  He thinks that the global useless class is going to be plugged into computer games and be on drugs.
[01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:19.884]   And then, you know, Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook creates meta Which he's like, oh, everybody's going to want to live in the virtual world.
[01:29:19.964 --> 01:29:21.585]  Well, you know, I got one of those things.
[01:29:21.705 --> 01:29:22.625]  I put it on.
[01:29:22.705 --> 01:29:24.286]  I tried to play the games.
[01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:27.747]  And, you know, half an hour, I got a splitting headache.
[01:29:28.167 --> 01:29:31.808]  And, you know, that thing has been sitting in my closet ever since.
[01:29:31.868 --> 01:29:33.369]  And that's why Facebook lost.
[01:29:33.609 --> 01:29:39.271]  But making dinner for your family or being at a campfire or praying to God never gets old.
[01:29:39.311 --> 01:29:39.851]  This gets better.
[01:29:41.707 --> 01:29:54.993]  Yeah, you know, every day that my wife and I are both home, we sit outside and have a little bit of coffee and, you know, we're just talking about broken sprinklers, you know, whether our fountains work in, you know, what our kids are doing, you know, people we know.
[01:29:55.013 --> 01:30:00.716]  I mean, to me, that is, you know, better than anything else in the world.
[01:30:00.796 --> 01:30:02.496]  That is the high point of my day.
[01:30:02.516 --> 01:30:03.717]  Because we're designed to do it.
[01:30:03.737 --> 01:30:04.617]  It's what we are.
[01:30:04.677 --> 01:30:05.898]  We got to go with what we are.
[01:30:07.256 --> 01:30:07.876]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:07.916 --> 01:30:18.583]  And you know, we human beings are designed to interact with about 40 to 60 people from like the small tribes that we lived in for hundreds of thousands of years.
[01:30:18.963 --> 01:30:32.032]   So that's why this internet age is such an age of isolation for people because we're forgetting that what's important is that contact And connection with physical people in our lives.
[01:30:32.352 --> 01:30:33.774]  And that's what we've got to get back to.
[01:30:33.794 --> 01:30:36.257]  We've got to get back to our connection with God.
[01:30:36.317 --> 01:30:38.079]  And the book breaks all that down.
[01:30:38.359 --> 01:30:39.140]  The book breaks that down.
[01:30:40.515 --> 01:30:43.216]  Yeah, we need to reconnect to the source.
[01:30:43.296 --> 01:30:47.939]  The source of our joy is our connection to God and our connection to each other.
[01:30:48.479 --> 01:30:50.300]  And that's what the globalists hate.
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:51.901]  They want to plug us into machines.
[01:30:53.001 --> 01:30:55.823]  We want to plug you into God, and we want to plug you into each other.
[01:30:55.963 --> 01:30:57.704]  Listen, I've never been a big drug guy.
[01:30:57.724 --> 01:31:00.585]  I like alcohol and nicotine, that's it, and some caffeine.
[01:31:00.645 --> 01:31:10.030]  But with my children, it was always, particularly as I've gotten older, I'm 50 here in a few months, my six-and-a-half-year-old daughter, she gets up way earlier than my wife, like 6 a.m., like I do.
[01:31:10.632 --> 01:31:12.593]  And I make these fabulous breakfasts.
[01:31:12.653 --> 01:31:14.754]  I mean, by fabulous, it's like what you get at a restaurant.
[01:31:15.495 --> 01:31:27.842]  And I just love doing it and slicing the fruit perfectly and cooking the eggs and bacon or turkey perfectly and making her hash browns perfectly and putting a heart and ketchup on the hash browns.
[01:31:27.882 --> 01:31:31.664]  And then I just sit there with her and talk to her and read her books.
[01:31:31.704 --> 01:31:32.545]  Now she reads books.
[01:31:32.565 --> 01:31:34.286]  She reads books to me and tells me jokes.
[01:31:34.826 --> 01:31:40.185]   And it's like, I took cocaine and meth a few times, made me feel horrible and I hated it.
[01:31:40.205 --> 01:31:41.245]  But people say it makes them high.
[01:31:41.726 --> 01:31:44.788]  I get high doing that for like an hour every morning.
[01:31:44.848 --> 01:31:45.968]  It's the best time of my life.
[01:31:46.309 --> 01:31:48.230]  And I literally get high doing it.
[01:31:48.690 --> 01:32:00.838]  Just like I get high at a camp out or hunting or, quite frankly, back in the old days, fighting or swimming a couple of miles or doing woodwork or just we're meant, or planting a garden and tending a garden.
[01:32:00.898 --> 01:32:02.719]  And it's just, we're supposed to do this.
[01:32:02.739 --> 01:32:03.860]  We're designed to do this.
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.481]  And people need to get back to work.
[01:32:07.675 --> 01:32:09.096]  And think about this, Alex.
[01:32:09.416 --> 01:32:12.178]  For a lot of people, you're the big bad wolf, okay?
[01:32:12.518 --> 01:32:15.720]  That's just the way you're the most persecuted man on the planet.
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:21.564]  And your greatest joy every day is when you can be of service to others.
[01:32:22.064 --> 01:32:27.507]  When you're of service to your daughter, when you're of service to your wife, when you're of service to the people that you work with.
[01:32:27.927 --> 01:32:29.408]  I mean, that's the source of joy.
[01:32:29.428 --> 01:32:35.269]   And it's All this other crap out there is just not important.
[01:32:35.309 --> 01:32:42.293]  And so I think that's one of the things that, you know, as I get more into this space, I'm sure I'm going to come under increasing attack.
[01:32:42.733 --> 01:32:48.656]  But hopefully I've secured my Fortress of Joy and they never get to my Fortress of Joy.
[01:32:48.676 --> 01:32:51.138]  Oh my God, we should write a book together called Fortress of Joy.
[01:32:53.359 --> 01:32:55.120]  Just a book about what empowers humans.
[01:32:55.902 --> 01:33:00.024]  Because you're right, none of the attacks mean anything, because all that matters is my family.
[01:33:00.044 --> 01:33:18.591]  Like, I love going to my parents once a week for dinner, and it's just, I realize they won't be here forever, these beautiful people, and just, and my older children come over, they're moved out, and we just have like a two-hour dinner, we laugh, we make jokes, and the French Bulldog jumps around and does tricks, and it's just, it's beautiful, and they want to take that from people.
[01:33:20.151 --> 01:33:20.331]  Yeah.
[01:33:20.631 --> 01:33:31.854]  And so, you know, and one of the things it's kind of been funny because as I've gotten higher visibility, I'll go to events and, you know, I'll have young people come up to me and they'll find out who I am.
[01:33:31.914 --> 01:33:37.456]  And they've read some of my books and they'll say things like, I got red billed three years ago.
[01:33:37.476 --> 01:33:45.401]   And, you know, Now, every day when I wake up, I'm reading about the plans of the globalists and this and that and the other thing.
[01:33:45.782 --> 01:33:58.392]  And, you know, I think they want me to be, like, you know, impressed that they are spending 14 hours a day, you know, on all the crap in the world.
[01:33:58.412 --> 01:34:03.095]  And, you know, I say to them, do that less, okay?
[01:34:04.525 --> 01:34:05.506]  Three or four hours.
[01:34:05.606 --> 01:34:09.207]  Okay, that's about all I can take of the terrible stuff in the world.
[01:34:09.628 --> 01:34:15.971]  And then the rest of my day, I'm doing all the things that bring me joy and contentment.
[01:34:16.851 --> 01:34:30.158]  And so I feel like those three or four hours that I'm attacking the dragon, attacking the devil, I am a fearless warrior.
[01:34:30.842 --> 01:34:40.765]  During that time, but I have to secure my Fortress of Joy constantly to make sure that I'm a good warrior.
[01:34:40.845 --> 01:34:41.785]  Hey, I'm going to ask listeners.
[01:34:41.825 --> 01:34:42.285]  Don't do this.
[01:34:42.345 --> 01:34:46.506]  Hey Kent or Wes, will you go get in your own name or whatever?
[01:34:46.806 --> 01:34:47.826]  Will you get Fortress of Joy?
[01:34:47.866 --> 01:34:48.667]  I'll pay you back right now.
[01:34:49.187 --> 01:34:50.067]  Dot news or dot com.
[01:34:52.782 --> 01:34:54.723]  I don't know if that's been written yet, but we should Google it.
[01:34:54.744 --> 01:34:56.485]  It's probably some horrible sex site.
[01:34:57.486 --> 01:35:05.692]  One time I was on air, trying to type in Jeunesse Yes, because I had this sponsor on, and the crew didn't have it, and pulled up something and bullied everyone.
[01:35:05.732 --> 01:35:07.853]  Who knows what Fortress of Joy is?
[01:35:07.913 --> 01:35:09.595]  I've never heard that term.
[01:35:09.955 --> 01:35:15.879]  That's what we need to form is a fortress of joy against their evil, because it's a saying, and many have said it, so no one knows who said it first.
[01:35:18.024 --> 01:35:22.486]  You don't fight because you hate the people in front of you, you fight because you love the people behind you.
[01:35:23.267 --> 01:35:23.947]  And that's it.
[01:35:23.967 --> 01:35:25.708]  We have a fortress of joy.
[01:35:27.589 --> 01:35:39.090]   Yeah, and if they can steal our joy, if when we appear in front of the public, we're scowling, we're angry, We're not convincing them to join us.
[01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:43.851]  And that's why you mentioned that the book was fun to read.
[01:35:44.192 --> 01:35:47.073]  Well, I love mocking stupid people.
[01:35:47.573 --> 01:35:49.573]  And I love mocking stupid plans.
[01:35:50.014 --> 01:35:51.974]  And it's fun.
[01:35:52.635 --> 01:35:54.935]  And our movement is fun.
[01:35:55.576 --> 01:35:57.436]  Connecting to God is joyful.
[01:35:57.536 --> 01:35:59.537]  Connecting to others is joyful.
[01:36:00.137 --> 01:36:09.481]   I say to those people who are living the liberal nightmare, I understand how miserable you are.
[01:36:10.702 --> 01:36:15.185]  What I'm asking you is to come over to the joyful side of life.
[01:36:15.925 --> 01:36:16.225]  Okay?
[01:36:16.485 --> 01:36:18.947]  So I'm not attacking them.
[01:36:19.927 --> 01:36:23.229]  I want to rescue them from their unhappiness.
[01:36:26.391 --> 01:36:26.732]  Beautiful.
[01:36:26.792 --> 01:36:33.556]  I'm just searching Fortress of Joy to make sure it's not a porn site.
[01:36:33.636 --> 01:36:34.897]  Fortress of Joy Church.
[01:36:36.054 --> 01:36:37.255]  That's something in California.
[01:36:37.575 --> 01:36:38.456]  We gotta get it right now.
[01:36:39.337 --> 01:36:42.018]  Because... I know, I know.
[01:36:42.199 --> 01:36:42.799]  Well, whatever.
[01:36:42.859 --> 01:36:43.379]  It doesn't matter.
[01:36:43.399 --> 01:36:44.460]  I said the title.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:44.740]  It's fine.
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:45.161]  We don't get it.
[01:36:46.101 --> 01:36:48.903]  But... Absolutely.
[01:36:49.123 --> 01:36:50.124]  So you just came up with that term.
[01:36:50.144 --> 01:36:50.785]  That's a great term.
[01:36:52.886 --> 01:36:54.387]  Hey, that's why you pay me the big bucks.
[01:36:54.868 --> 01:36:57.349]  Alright, look, look, look.
[01:36:57.369 --> 01:36:58.250]  You gotta come back.
[01:36:58.570 --> 01:37:00.672]  Because I gotta jam this in an hour and a half on Monday.
[01:37:02.413 --> 01:37:03.774]  But let's race through the other chapters.
[01:37:03.794 --> 01:37:04.634]  We're only at like chapter 5 now.
[01:37:06.038 --> 01:37:06.218]  Sure.
[01:37:06.778 --> 01:37:08.559]  I'll just do a sentence or two about each one.
[01:37:08.799 --> 01:37:11.040]  Chapter five, the eternal war of tyrants.
[01:37:12.701 --> 01:37:16.203]  Yeah, basically, if you're a tyrant, you're not a good partner.
[01:37:16.323 --> 01:37:18.204]  You will betray each other constantly.
[01:37:18.664 --> 01:37:21.826]  Good guys don't get it together until five minutes before midnight.
[01:37:22.446 --> 01:37:26.208]  You know, the bad guys always plan and then they betray each other and then they lose.
[01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:28.649]  Which is a powerful thing.
[01:37:28.989 --> 01:37:32.751]  If the left bans the Republican Party like they're trying to do, they'll just have sectarian war with themselves.
[01:37:34.132 --> 01:37:34.592]  Absolutely.
[01:37:35.323 --> 01:37:36.624]  Let's go ahead and go to the next one here.
[01:37:36.644 --> 01:37:38.404]  Chapter 6, the war machine.
[01:37:38.784 --> 01:37:39.545]  That's an important one.
[01:37:40.885 --> 01:37:47.845]   Yeah, you know, how did we get into this state where the military controls so much and when
[01:37:47.845 --> 01:37:55.904]   you realize that the United States spends over $800 billion a year, has over 750 overseas
[01:37:55.904 --> 01:38:02.805]   bases and our closest 10 competitors don't spend as much as we spend?
[01:38:03.421 --> 01:38:10.364]  And, you know, with us having 750 bases overseas, well, that's a recipe for continued conflict.
[01:38:10.764 --> 01:38:15.266]  You know, our nearest competitor is Great Britain, which I think has like 12 or 15.
[01:38:17.627 --> 01:38:18.147]  Incredible.
[01:38:18.547 --> 01:38:19.948]  And we get a lot more into it.
[01:38:19.988 --> 01:38:21.609]  I mean, we're just glazing over this now.
[01:38:22.109 --> 01:38:22.749]  We've got a few minutes.
[01:38:22.769 --> 01:38:24.510]  We can spend more than 20 seconds apiece on these.
[01:38:25.210 --> 01:38:27.851]  Chapter 7, the Deep State makes its move.
[01:38:27.891 --> 01:38:29.592]  The point is they're taking over right now.
[01:38:30.993 --> 01:38:45.556]  Yeah, that looks to, you know, where I think was the real start of all of this was with Eisenhower's military industrial speech, his farewell address, and then you had the Kennedy administration, and that was cut short.
[01:38:45.776 --> 01:38:55.619]  And shortly after John Kennedy's assassination, we went full bore into Vietnam, you know, our longest war until the War on Terror.
[01:38:56.619 --> 01:39:00.360]  And we have become a militarized war state.
[01:39:01.401 --> 01:39:19.095]  It's not leading us to world destruction, I don't think, but I think it's leading us to continued conflict, making sure that the military-industrial complex sells all its weapons in one war, and then we've got to replace all the ammunition.
[01:39:19.375 --> 01:39:27.281]  And then to make sure that happens, they've got to take over here domestically, which Homeland Security and the Pentagon are now directing the American people.
[01:39:27.321 --> 01:39:28.262]  That's the key of the chapter.
[01:39:29.508 --> 01:39:35.714]  Yeah, and many people have said you cannot be a republic and an empire at the same time.
[01:39:36.415 --> 01:39:41.180]  And the United States, over the past 50 years, has become an empire.
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:43.582]  We need to turn it back to the republic.
[01:39:43.642 --> 01:39:45.704]  We need to get rid of these overseas bases.
[01:39:45.764 --> 01:39:51.770]  We need to cut our military spending, spend it on the people at home, or bring down the debt.
[01:39:52.211 --> 01:39:56.475]   You know, we need to To not be the big bully on the block.
[01:39:56.695 --> 01:39:57.096]  Absolutely.
[01:39:57.136 --> 01:40:01.420]  Let's go to the next chapter here, after we talk about the war machine.
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:03.422]  Chapter 7, The Deep State Makes Its Move.
[01:40:03.742 --> 01:40:09.348]  Chapter 8, The Education of Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan, as well as others.
[01:40:09.388 --> 01:40:10.229]  That's an important chapter.
[01:40:10.249 --> 01:40:10.750]  That's a big one.
[01:40:12.498 --> 01:40:18.822]  Yeah, that was great because you, you know, told me, you know, about your relationship behind the scenes with all these people.
[01:40:18.902 --> 01:40:23.944]  And, you know, you were also very clear that you didn't want to feel like you violated any confidences.
[01:40:24.004 --> 01:40:30.468]  So we really stuck with, you know, what is in the public record and, you know, a couple of things that are outside of the public record.
[01:40:30.488 --> 01:40:33.630]  But I really think that we tried to be respectful.
[01:40:33.670 --> 01:40:43.600]   But You know, so many people have credited you with changing their thinking on things, you know, from people like Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan and Russell Brand.
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:44.962]  And they've said so publicly.
[01:40:45.382 --> 01:41:15.833]   And I think it's just important that people understand that really kind of behind the scenes, you know, you guys talk like, you know, regular People talk and, you know, there can be little arguments and fights and, you know, you are a very passionate person, Alex, but I have noticed a consistent pattern that, you know, if you get a little bit too passionate, you know, you are then, you know, five minutes later saying, I'm sorry, I got a little bit too passionate.
[01:41:16.233 --> 01:41:19.934]  And I think... Well, expanding on that, I don't get any pushback from Joe Rogan.
[01:41:19.994 --> 01:41:20.994]  I don't get any pushback now.
[01:41:21.474 --> 01:41:23.515]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:41:23.535 --> 01:41:24.316]  They now see it.
[01:41:24.416 --> 01:41:24.776]  I know.
[01:41:25.196 --> 01:41:28.539]  So we definitely are having some big victories behind the scenes.
[01:41:28.579 --> 01:41:34.382]  And what does it say that not just them, but all the most popular people in the Western world, but around the world, are anti-globalist?
[01:41:34.863 --> 01:41:36.083]  The globalists know that.
[01:41:36.123 --> 01:41:38.265]  I mean, the most popular thing is anti-globalism.
[01:41:39.826 --> 01:41:46.862]   Yeah, so when people get, you know, disheartened, By what they see in the world.
[01:41:47.343 --> 01:41:50.165]  I mean, your effect and the message.
[01:41:50.265 --> 01:41:53.267]  Because, you know, a lot of other people will take different pieces of it.
[01:41:53.768 --> 01:41:58.632]  But this pro-human message is winning incredibly.
[01:41:58.672 --> 01:42:07.899]  I mean, I think the greatest testament to that is, you know, when Tucker Carlson was on Fox News, you know, he'd have a big night, three or four million people.
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:12.964]  And people are like, oh, you know, he is the guy we trust the most in the mainstream news.
[01:42:14.148 --> 01:42:20.991]  Once he leaves the mainstream news and he's on his own, he's getting $100, $150, $200 million.
[01:42:21.011 --> 01:42:26.993]  I think that interview we had with the guy who's going to be president in Argentina, I think it's like $250 million.
[01:42:27.854 --> 01:42:30.135]  The Trump one's like $400 million.
[01:42:30.535 --> 01:42:31.455]  The average is $100 million.
[01:42:31.835 --> 01:42:39.298]  Chapter 9, Jeffrey Epstein, Renfield of the Globalist, Dracula's, but even worse, they prey on their own children.
[01:42:39.338 --> 01:42:40.599]  That's a huge chapter.
[01:42:42.239 --> 01:42:42.839]  Yeah.
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:51.084]  And all credit to you, because I said to you when I was starting to work on that, I said, hey, Alex, I don't understand the Jeffrey Epstein story.
[01:42:51.164 --> 01:42:55.187]  You know, I understand pieces of it, but the pieces don't make any sense.
[01:42:55.327 --> 01:43:00.110]   You know, I understand he's a rich guy and OK, he's got some That's probably the biggest chapter.
[01:42:59.930 --> 01:43:05.090]   sexual things. But, you know, after a while, that kind of gets boring. What's the plan?
[01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:09.849]   And you went through the plan and you gave me all the sources. And, you know, I'm amazed
[01:43:09.849 --> 01:43:16.170]   my hair is still, you know, is not white and it's still there because it was terrifying
[01:43:16.170 --> 01:43:20.609]   what you told me. And we put that on the book and it's all abundantly documented.
[01:43:20.609 --> 01:43:22.570]  That's probably the biggest chapter.
[01:43:22.570 --> 01:43:26.930]  Yeah, I think so. And I think that's like 50 pages long.
[01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:27.930]  Wow.
[01:43:27.930 --> 01:43:31.010]   Let's talk about the next chapter here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:31.004 --> 01:43:33.868]  Again, this is a book everybody needs to get.
[01:43:33.888 --> 01:43:36.492]  Infowarstore.com, Amazon.
[01:43:37.333 --> 01:43:41.540]  Let's go to Chapter 10, The COVID-19 Lies and Deception.
[01:43:43.072 --> 01:43:52.642]  Yeah, you know, that was really kind of in my wheelhouse because I've written four books with Dr. Judy Mikevich, and as you can see, I've got another book here, Presidential Takedown.
[01:43:53.082 --> 01:44:00.029]  That was written with Dr. Paul Alexander, who is the senior pandemic advisor from about May of 2020 to September of 2020.
[01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:14.706]   And so, you know, he I've been a writer of the rebels who are outside the castle walls, well with Paul Alexander who's inside the castle walls.
[01:44:15.126 --> 01:44:18.628]  So I was able to condense all of that into I think about 40 pages.
[01:44:19.688 --> 01:44:23.430]  But hey, you want a quick read to know how messed up COVID was?
[01:44:23.571 --> 01:44:24.211]  It's all in there.
[01:44:25.629 --> 01:44:32.719]  And continuing with more of the chapters from The Great Awakening at InfoWarshaw.com and of course at Amazon.com, let's push to number one.
[01:44:33.721 --> 01:44:40.190]  We have chapter 11, Selling Your Soul to Hollywood and the CIA.
[01:44:42.383 --> 01:45:08.449]   Yeah, well, you know, what you had told me about your adventures in Hollywood and what other people had done, and I think what people don't understand is there's really, you know, many centers of power in our country and, you know, a lot of people will say like, oh, I understand that, you know, our military industrial complex Probably controls our national security correspondence and everything.
[01:45:08.489 --> 01:45:10.971]  And, you know, you can look at other forms of control.
[01:45:11.011 --> 01:45:23.198]  But what we don't understand is that, you know, there's abundant documentation that our intelligence agencies have connections in Hollywood and are programming what we see.
[01:45:23.779 --> 01:45:28.502]  And, you know, this whole idea of predictive programming is something that, you know, I was not really that familiar with.
[01:45:28.602 --> 01:45:33.864]   But You know, as I did a deep dive into it, and I could see, like, hey, you know, who's doing this?
[01:45:33.964 --> 01:45:42.807]  And, you know, to have people like Ben Affleck, who, you know, most people would think of as, you know, an extreme liberal, you know, say at one point after making his movie Argo.
[01:45:43.188 --> 01:45:47.089]  Yeah, I think there are probably a lot of people in Hollywood who are intelligence agents.
[01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:48.810]  And you see the message.
[01:45:49.090 --> 01:45:52.951]  It tells you what the CIA wants, destroy America, destroy our families.
[01:45:54.032 --> 01:45:56.153]  Chapter 12, combat tactics for victory.
[01:45:56.193 --> 01:45:56.953]  That's really important.
[01:45:58.365 --> 01:46:04.089]  Yeah, you know, just how do you how do you connect with with that divine source?
[01:46:05.230 --> 01:46:18.260]  And, you know, one of the things that we talked about is like, you know, and you always ask this and Steve Bannon, it's kind of funny to watch the two of you, because both of you at some point in your interviews will with people say, like, where are we?
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.421]  Where do you think we are?
[01:46:20.262 --> 01:46:40.425]   And, you know, for me, the answer was the story of Exodus, that, you know, Moses, you know, Had the people of Israel rise out of slavery, they were the plagues, they left Egypt, they're at the Red Sea, they see Pharaoh's army approaching.
[01:46:41.085 --> 01:46:58.764]   And, you know, the Israelites, after seeing all the wonders that God provided them to escape from Europe, When they see the Egyptian army start complaining to Moses, why did you take us out of Egypt?
[01:46:59.384 --> 01:47:05.227]  And, you know, God gets, Moses gets the message from God, be still and know God.
[01:47:06.067 --> 01:47:11.469]  And so what I say is, you know, and that's not a trust the plan idea.
[01:47:11.489 --> 01:47:21.074]  The idea behind that is that we human beings need to do everything we know how to do.
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:25.661]  To show our devotion to God and to what's right.
[01:47:25.861 --> 01:47:27.141]  And then God shows up.
[01:47:28.122 --> 01:47:29.902]  And then we have to let go of the result.
[01:47:30.582 --> 01:47:48.507]  And so, you know, I'm getting to a certain age, you're getting to a certain age, I know I'm not going to be here forever, and I'm just saying, I want my legacy to be that I have done what I consider to be right to the best of my knowledge at this time.
[01:47:48.527 --> 01:47:48.847]  Beautiful.
[01:47:48.867 --> 01:47:50.488]  And that's what everybody needs to be.
[01:47:52.076 --> 01:47:53.937]  Then we have the final battle.
[01:47:56.778 --> 01:48:10.242]  Yeah, it just kind of revisiting that positive human message, because as you always talk about the Renaissance, it's this flowering of human creativity.
[01:48:10.762 --> 01:48:16.424]  It's not a top-down, you know, way of doing.
[01:48:16.484 --> 01:48:17.945]  It's a bottom-up.
[01:48:18.665 --> 01:48:37.630]   You know, if the globalists are saying That there are some among us who will be part of a useless class and depending upon, you know, which, you know, pointy headed intellectual you quote, they think that 80 to 90% of us should be gone.
[01:48:39.573 --> 01:48:42.556]  We're saying every human being has value.
[01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:49.882]  And the Renaissance was this great flowering of the public, of the populace.
[01:48:50.562 --> 01:48:52.863]  Where do we find our joy?
[01:48:53.443 --> 01:48:56.404]  How do we bring that into the political sphere?
[01:48:56.424 --> 01:49:03.386]  And how do we create a world which is more beautiful than anything we can imagine?
[01:49:04.446 --> 01:49:08.167]  And then we have the final chapter here.
[01:49:11.092 --> 01:49:19.315]  Before the co-authors note, writing for Alex Jones, how you know you're winning, more positive examples of the fact that we're turning the tide together.
[01:49:19.335 --> 01:49:23.296]  And then in closing, get into writing with me.
[01:49:23.316 --> 01:49:25.317]  You wanted to write that final chapter.
[01:49:25.357 --> 01:49:25.937]  Why'd you do that?
[01:49:27.898 --> 01:49:35.461]  Well, you know, one of the things that I talk about is I thought, originally thought when I was a young man, I was going to be a prosecutor.
[01:49:35.541 --> 01:49:36.921]  That was my goal.
[01:49:36.961 --> 01:49:38.582]  And then I worked in criminal law.
[01:49:39.198 --> 01:49:46.242]  And you know, so I admired people like Rudy Giuliani going after the mob.
[01:49:46.262 --> 01:49:51.425]  I admired people like Eliot Ness going after Al Capone.
[01:49:51.905 --> 01:49:57.789]  And then I worked in it and I started to also at the same time become aware of the great criminal defense attorneys.
[01:49:58.269 --> 01:50:02.350]  You know, people like Alan Dershowitz, Jerry Spence, William Kunstler.
[01:50:03.391 --> 01:50:10.693]  In law school, I was fortunate enough to be taught by a guy named Bernie Siegel, who actually defended the Green Beret killer Jeffrey McDonnell.
[01:50:11.673 --> 01:50:18.816]  And, you know, as much at the time as I didn't, you know, understand, I didn't agree with them.
[01:50:19.676 --> 01:50:23.037]  I admired their ability to stand up.
[01:50:23.752 --> 01:50:32.859]  Against the system to be one man against something just use their intellect, not their fists, not bombs, not guns, but their intellect.
[01:50:33.679 --> 01:50:43.206]  And so, you know, I had the experience of, you know, interacting some with a guy named Tony Sarah, who was like so big against the war on drugs.
[01:50:43.727 --> 01:50:59.586]   And, you know, as I started to learn more and more, I understood like, gee, the criminal defense attorney has a real Part in our society and, you know, when it came to you, I kind of looked at you as you were being tried in the court of public opinion.
[01:51:00.146 --> 01:51:05.691]  And if you are being tried in the court of public opinion, I want to be your defense attorney.
[01:51:05.771 --> 01:51:12.236]  So I, I consider myself Alex Jones's defense attorney in the court of public opinion.
[01:51:12.256 --> 01:51:15.998]  And, and the verdict is going to be in our favor.
[01:51:16.199 --> 01:51:19.621]  And so I, I just felt like you had been railroaded.
[01:51:20.001 --> 01:51:33.735]   You had been Maligned, and with every piece of skill and intelligence that I had, I was going to write the defense brief for Alex Jones, and that's what I consider this book to be.
[01:51:34.096 --> 01:51:36.257]  Which is the defense of populism and a pro-human future.
[01:51:36.277 --> 01:51:41.242]  Yeah, and the defense of the ideas that you've talked about based on your extensive research.
[01:51:42.150 --> 01:51:45.671]  The Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:51:46.131 --> 01:51:48.792]  Alex Jones with Kent Eckenlively, forward by Stephen K. Bannon.
[01:51:49.212 --> 01:51:51.792]  Available now at InfolwerStore.com as a fundraiser, give us on air.
[01:51:52.172 --> 01:51:56.053]  Signed, also unsigned, available at Infolwer Store, get it at Amazon, drive it to number one.
[01:51:56.653 --> 01:51:58.334]  Important to do that, a great Christmas gift.
[01:51:58.354 --> 01:52:02.155]  You know, don't do a bunch of shopping, don't spend gas, don't get mugged at the mall.
[01:52:02.555 --> 01:52:06.556]  Just buy ten copies of the unsigned book and buy one copy of the signed if you want.
[01:52:07.136 --> 01:52:08.637]  And just give people the Great Awakening.
[01:52:08.677 --> 01:52:09.457]  It's what it's all about.
[01:52:09.497 --> 01:52:10.398]  Will this book save the world?
[01:52:10.458 --> 01:52:10.698]  No.
[01:52:11.138 --> 01:52:13.819]  But all of our resistance together with God behind us will, will.
[01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:15.240]  We will win.
[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:16.981]  Kent Eckenleible, thank you so much.
[01:52:18.642 --> 01:52:19.442]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[01:52:20.002 --> 01:52:20.243]  All right.
[01:52:20.303 --> 01:52:22.264]  That was a powerful two hours.
[01:52:22.284 --> 01:52:25.285]  Appreciate the crew coming in for this live Saturday show.
[01:52:25.305 --> 01:52:32.709]  We're obviously tomorrow night on the Sunday show going to be tracking this extremely dangerous war.
[01:52:34.753 --> 01:52:37.735]  That is going to suck in Iran and suck in everything else.
[01:52:38.355 --> 01:52:40.396]  Because Iran is trying to act like that it's Hamas.
[01:52:41.757 --> 01:52:43.057]  This is Iran working with Hamas.
[01:52:43.838 --> 01:52:45.819]  And we just pray that peace comes at this stop.
[01:52:46.539 --> 01:52:51.322]  But we'll obviously have a lot for you at InfoWars.com as developments unfold.
[01:52:51.402 --> 01:52:53.423]  Israel's got to repel this invasion first.
[01:52:53.903 --> 01:52:56.644]  But I would expect them to level Gaza, which is so sad.
[01:52:56.664 --> 01:52:57.485]  People there as well.
[01:52:57.925 --> 01:53:03.368]  And then I would predict major actions, bare minimum killing of Iranian generals and others.
[01:53:04.148 --> 01:53:11.359]  Perhaps an attack after they've taken out Gaza in the north there in Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based.
[01:53:11.719 --> 01:53:13.542]  But Hezbollah is also here in our country.
[01:53:14.283 --> 01:53:16.887]  And I'll go back to how did Israel not know this attack was coming?
[01:53:17.247 --> 01:53:18.729]  That's a big issue in this as well.
[01:53:19.230 --> 01:53:19.751]  Separately!
[01:53:21.015 --> 01:53:24.217]  We have great products at InfoWarsTore.com that fund this broadcast.
[01:53:24.237 --> 01:53:30.740]  It will also enrich your life, do amazing things for your stamina, your energy, your immune system, your bones, your joints, your brain.
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:35.903]  We have the Trifecta sale extended until Monday, but we've got to end it because one of these is about to sell out.
[01:53:36.423 --> 01:53:44.267]  DNA Force Plus, BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and Real Red Pill Plus, 40% off together, 25% off individually.
[01:53:44.327 --> 01:53:46.548]  Vitamineral Fusion back in stock.
[01:53:46.568 --> 01:53:52.039]   So let's end the broadcast with a three-minute Trifecta ad because Like I said, we're barely in the black.
[01:53:52.659 --> 01:53:53.479]  We just stay here.
[01:53:53.879 --> 01:53:57.260]  And it's so frustrating because I want to hire Savannah Hernandez back.
[01:53:57.300 --> 01:53:58.461]  I want to hire Drew Hernandez.
[01:53:58.501 --> 01:53:59.181]  No relation.
[01:53:59.501 --> 01:54:02.822]  They're ready to take the job for low pay, but there's not pay for them.
[01:54:03.483 --> 01:54:04.543]  I want to cover Bilderberg.
[01:54:04.583 --> 01:54:05.723]  I want to cover Bohemian Grove.
[01:54:06.104 --> 01:54:07.384]  I want to cover Skull and Bones.
[01:54:07.444 --> 01:54:10.185]  I want to cover RNC, DNC.
[01:54:10.205 --> 01:54:12.326]  I want to be at the border every month or more.
[01:54:13.266 --> 01:54:14.807]  Because it has a huge effect.
[01:54:15.167 --> 01:54:23.012]  We reach tens of millions when we do, but we don't even have the funds to do that with putting the crew up in like Motel 6s and myself.
[01:54:23.792 --> 01:54:25.733]  So there's just not money for any of it.
[01:54:26.193 --> 01:54:27.074]  And limited security.
[01:54:27.094 --> 01:54:28.715]  We've got to have at least three or four security guys.
[01:54:29.235 --> 01:54:32.600]  When we go to the most dangerous areas, the border, and they're working 50 bucks an hour.
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:33.061]  They deserve it.
[01:54:33.081 --> 01:54:33.682]  They're great people.
[01:54:33.982 --> 01:54:35.605]  I mean, it takes money to prosecute a war.
[01:54:36.045 --> 01:54:37.588]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:54:37.868 --> 01:54:39.210]  Take advantage of the trifecta sale.
