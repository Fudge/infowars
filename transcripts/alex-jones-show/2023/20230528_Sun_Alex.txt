[00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:01.709]  It's starting to catch on, folks.
[00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:03.750]  It's starting to catch on.
[00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:16.834]  I mean, in a way, the American left has done this for themselves, because they also have hyper-polarized things, but also made their voters hyper-aware.
[00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:23.216]  And for years, they've been looking around street corners for Nazis and white supremacists, and it's finally starting to catch up.
[00:00:23.376 --> 00:00:24.276]  You know, wait a second.
[00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:38.117]  You know, I'm not finding Nazis, white supremacists, they're not really my problem, but you know, I'm, uh, my energy bill is going up, and my grocery bill is going up, and gas prices keep going up, and gee, now they're starting a war and I'm supposed to pay for it?
[00:00:38.177 --> 00:00:38.697]  What the heck?
[00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:39.658]  What's going on here?
[00:00:40.378 --> 00:00:47.262]  All these people that were for the little guy, all these people that said they would redistribute the wealth, they keep getting richer, I keep getting poorer!
[00:00:47.963 --> 00:00:48.963]  What is going on here?
[00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:51.705]  Yeah.
[00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:54.567]  It's starting to catch on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:56.860]  It's starting to catch on.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:06.090]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.149]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:25.750]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:35.250]  [Music]
[00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:44.392]  Dr. David Martin was recently a guest at the European Union and laid out the timeline for the biggest democide in recorded history.
[00:01:44.853 --> 00:01:48.076]  You can see the full video on Band.Video.
[00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:49.598]  This is my short edit.
[00:01:49.718 --> 00:02:04.901]   Coronavirus was identified in 1965 as one of the first infectious Replicatable viral models that could be used to modify a series of other experiences of the human condition.
[00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:15.347]  What's particularly interesting about its isolation in 1965 was that it was immediately identified as a pathogen that could be used and modified for a whole host of reasons.
[00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:27.254]   In 1966, The very first COV, coronavirus model, was used as a transatlantic biological experiment in human manipulation.
[00:02:27.354 --> 00:02:33.898]  And in 1967, we did the first human trials on inoculating people with modified coronavirus.
[00:02:34.038 --> 00:02:37.601]  The common cold was turned into a chimera in the 1970s.
[00:02:39.842 --> 00:02:48.628]  And in 1975, 1976, and 1977, we started figuring out how to modify coronavirus by putting it into different animals.
[00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.990]  Pigs and dogs.
[00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.594]  And that became the basis for Pfizer's first spike protein vaccine patent, filed, are you ready for this?
[00:02:59.035 --> 00:02:59.336]  In 1990.
[00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:03.178]  And in 1990, they found out that there was a problem with vaccines.
[00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:05.340]  They didn't work.
[00:03:06.588 --> 00:03:09.869]  It turns out that coronavirus is a very malleable model.
[00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.931]  It transforms and it changes and it mutates over time.
[00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:21.550]   As a matter of fact, every publication on vaccines for coronavirus from 1990 until 2018,
[00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:29.431]   every single publication concluded that coronavirus escapes the vaccine impulse.
[00:03:29.477 --> 00:03:38.060]  In 2002, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill patented, and I quote, an infectious replication defective clone of coronavirus.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.423]  And that work, patented at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, mysteriously preceded SARS 1.0.
[00:03:46.103 --> 00:03:46.724]  By a year.
[00:03:47.184 --> 00:03:56.491]  In 2005, this particular pathogen was specifically labeled as a bioterrorism and bioweapon platform technology.
[00:03:56.691 --> 00:04:02.696]  And from 2005 onwards, it was actually a biowarfare enabling agent.
[00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:04.357]  It's official classification.
[00:04:04.497 --> 00:04:36.522]   We have been lured into believing that EcoHealth Alliance and DARPA and all of these organizations are what we should be pointing to, but we've been specifically requested to ignore the facts that over 10 billion dollars have been funneled through black operations Through the check of Anthony Fauci and a side-by-side ledger where NIAID has a balance sheet and next to it is a biodefense balance sheet equivalent dollar-for-dollar matching that no one in the media talks about.
[00:04:36.963 --> 00:04:45.283]   poised for human emergence in 2016 at the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
[00:04:45.283 --> 00:04:52.882]   such that by the time we get to 2017 and 2018, the following phrase entered into common parlance
[00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:55.002]  among the community.
[00:04:55.002 --> 00:05:01.403]   There is going to be an accidental or intentional release of a respiratory pathogen.
[00:05:01.414 --> 00:05:17.445]  Seven months before the allegation of patient number one, four patent applications of Moderna were modified to include the term accidental or intentional release of a respiratory pathogen as the justification for making a vaccine for a thing that did not exist.
[00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:25.199]  The intent was to get the world to accept a universal vaccine template, and the intent was to use coronavirus to get there.
[00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:31.180]  This was premeditated domestic terrorism stated at the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2015.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.801]  That sounds like a bat and a pangolin went into a bar in the Wuhan market.
[00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:42.182]  This is an act of biological and chemical warfare perpetrated on the human race.
[00:05:42.722 --> 00:05:45.443]  See the full video at band.video.
[00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:56.475]  On this Memorial Day weekend, let us remember our friends and family that we've lost in this war against we the people being waged by our own government.
[00:05:56.816 --> 00:05:59.438]  And let us never rest until there is justice.
[00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:02.721]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:06:05.268 --> 00:06:12.336]  And of course you can find all of Greg Reese's reports at band.video and madmaxworld.tv.
[00:06:12.376 --> 00:06:14.219]  The Alex Jones Show Sunday edition is live.
[00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:19.985]  Happy Memorial Day weekend to you, Info Warriors!
[00:06:21.391 --> 00:06:31.854]  And we are grateful that you choose to spend your Sunday evening with us here on this May 28th, 2023 edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:31.874 --> 00:06:35.456]  We're gonna have a news-heavy broadcast tonight.
[00:06:35.656 --> 00:06:37.636]  A news-heavy broadcast.
[00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:38.517]  I got a ton of news.
[00:06:39.797 --> 00:06:45.379]  We're gonna expand on what we saw from the latest special report from Greg Reese.
[00:06:48.627 --> 00:06:58.855]  How can the whole world know, it's so obvious, how can the whole world know that the COVID-19 pandemic was a scam?
[00:06:58.995 --> 00:07:20.943]   It was planned out, it was done intentionally, there were motivations behind it, and yet the perpetrators, the criminals, the mad scientists, the murderers responsible for that are somehow It's like, you can't even, they don't even slip through your fingertips.
[00:07:21.063 --> 00:07:22.504]  They just, you can't even grab them.
[00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:27.147]  It's like they completely elude justice.
[00:07:28.288 --> 00:07:31.971]  Despite, here it is, 2023, and the whole world knows.
[00:07:34.352 --> 00:07:37.735]  When you have top delegations in Europe meeting, like in that video.
[00:07:38.115 --> 00:07:39.216]  We'll have more of that, by the way.
[00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:41.958]  With Dr. David Martin.
[00:07:42.078 --> 00:07:42.898]  We're gonna play more of that.
[00:07:42.918 --> 00:07:43.759]  We do have the full video.
[00:07:45.478 --> 00:07:46.159]  It's just amazing.
[00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:57.910]  But there's other news when it comes to the World Health Organization, when it comes to what Russia is doing in Ukraine, and then also when it comes to the vaccines.
[00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.974]  Now, I get this a lot, and this is good news, folks.
[00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:05.017]  Hey, what happened to the vaccine injuries?
[00:08:05.037 --> 00:08:06.458]  We don't hear much about the vaccine injuries.
[00:08:06.498 --> 00:08:13.778]   Well, maybe we're kind of through the first Phase of this to figure out what's really going on and most
[00:08:13.778 --> 00:08:17.158]   people didn't go for the second booster the third booster the fourth booster
[00:08:17.158 --> 00:08:22.038]   That's when you really put yourself in danger, so it might be you get one of these things and
[00:08:22.038 --> 00:08:26.838]   You can either just survive with whatever it does to you, or maybe you got hit with a
[00:08:26.838 --> 00:08:36.840]   We'll say a placebo But hey, maybe you only got one of these things I
[00:08:36.823 --> 00:08:37.983]  Odds are you're going to be okay.
[00:08:38.383 --> 00:08:39.103]  Not for everybody.
[00:08:39.523 --> 00:08:41.944]  But you got the boosters, and man, it's ramping up.
[00:08:41.984 --> 00:08:44.724]  So, still vaccine injuries happening.
[00:08:46.045 --> 00:08:53.466]  But we may have really... They didn't get the numbers they wanted when it comes to the quote-unquote COVID deaths.
[00:08:54.787 --> 00:09:00.508]  Or what you might find in the vaccine adverse reaction database.
[00:09:03.158 --> 00:09:17.027]  All of the COVID-19 vaccine deaths that are more dead from this COVID-19 vaccine than any other vaccine in medical history combined, at least to the reporting that we have access to on the VAERS website.
[00:09:17.067 --> 00:09:18.788]  So, we're going to tie all that together.
[00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.191]  Now, the big news is the clown debt.
[00:09:23.171 --> 00:09:24.092]  The clown debt ceiling.
[00:09:26.153 --> 00:09:28.455]  Everybody wants to talk about the clown debt ceiling.
[00:09:30.831 --> 00:09:35.953]  But we don't want to talk about the elephant in the room, which is, so what now?
[00:09:36.093 --> 00:09:54.977]   The average American goes from owing, if you believe this economic theory, and I guess it is just a theory, or if you accept your servitude to the Federal Reserve, Every American household owes, I think, $96,000.
[00:09:55.777 --> 00:09:57.559]  That's the U.S.
[00:09:57.599 --> 00:09:58.860]  debt divided by every citizen.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.561]  Oh, what about the non-citizens that are here?
[00:10:00.762 --> 00:10:01.702]  Well, maybe then it goes down to $75,000.
[00:10:02.163 --> 00:10:03.584]  I'm sure they'll be willing to pay it.
[00:10:04.925 --> 00:10:06.667]  But nobody, who's going to pay that debt?
[00:10:08.128 --> 00:10:10.230]  No, it just keeps going up and up and up and up and up.
[00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.952]  And we just never ask the obvious question.
[00:10:15.534 --> 00:10:19.338]  We just never look to the obvious.
[00:10:21.305 --> 00:10:22.685]  The whole system is a joke.
[00:10:23.165 --> 00:10:24.966]  The whole system is used to control you.
[00:10:25.406 --> 00:10:28.706]  The whole centralization of banking is meant to enslave you.
[00:10:29.166 --> 00:10:31.127]  And it's all going to the digital currency.
[00:10:31.627 --> 00:10:33.007]  So, they don't care.
[00:10:33.027 --> 00:10:34.287]  40 trillion in debt.
[00:10:34.307 --> 00:10:35.848]  100 trillion in debt.
[00:10:36.828 --> 00:10:38.548]  Fund unlimited IRS agents.
[00:10:38.828 --> 00:10:40.248]  Fund limited IRS agents.
[00:10:40.369 --> 00:10:41.169]  It doesn't matter.
[00:10:41.609 --> 00:10:43.829]  They've got to get the central bank digital currency.
[00:10:44.109 --> 00:10:47.550]  And they have to prop up all their fiat currencies in the meantime.
[00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.491]  So that they can have a smooth transition.
[00:10:50.511 --> 00:10:52.391]  That's why they're bailing out all the banks.
[00:10:55.312 --> 00:10:59.853]  And then you're just fully into the digital slave state.
[00:11:02.074 --> 00:11:03.734]  Can't buy or sell.
[00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:06.955]  Unless you're a good slave.
[00:11:06.975 --> 00:11:08.836]  You gotta have a good social credit score.
[00:11:09.216 --> 00:11:11.757]  You gotta have a good carbon credit score.
[00:11:13.137 --> 00:11:15.818]  You gotta be a good liberal progressive democrat.
[00:11:16.158 --> 00:11:16.478]  Yeah.
[00:11:20.831 --> 00:11:23.112]  Now apparently they've reached a deal.
[00:11:23.312 --> 00:11:24.732]  I don't want to make a big thing about this.
[00:11:24.912 --> 00:11:26.313]  It's all clown debt anyway.
[00:11:27.993 --> 00:11:38.737]  But it'll be a major moment for Kevin McCarthy to either say, hey, I did something or to get lambasted for doing nothing.
[00:11:39.357 --> 00:11:41.198]  And right now it looks like the latter.
[00:11:42.378 --> 00:11:47.480]  But why would you want to negotiate with Joe Biden anyway when you know all the crimes he's responsible for?
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:59.251]   But then But then, they want to come after one of the great Attorney Generals in the United States of America, and that's Attorney General Ken Paxson here in Texas.
[00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:07.979]  It's actually just disgusting stuff, what's happened here in the Texas Republican Party in the last, let's say, four weeks.
[00:12:11.209 --> 00:12:20.198]  You know, I'm not going to sit here and judge a human that makes the same mistakes that I've made or that people make commonly.
[00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:26.222]  But it's really a clown show, unfortunately, what's going on in the Texas GOP now.
[00:12:27.343 --> 00:12:40.387]  Unable to control their drinking habits, unable to control their lust for one another, and so now Ken Paxton is getting impeached because the Texas GOP is in absolute shambles.
[00:12:40.687 --> 00:12:44.808]  Now, somehow, throughout this, they've been able to have some major policy victories.
[00:12:46.345 --> 00:12:47.926]  Just with the overwhelming number of votes.
[00:12:47.986 --> 00:12:53.590]  But now Ken Paxton, the swamp of Texas, trying to drain Ken Paxton.
[00:12:54.331 --> 00:12:56.252]  And so we'll talk a little bit about that.
[00:12:57.013 --> 00:13:02.037]  And you need to beware if you're in other states and you've got a good Attorney General, this is how they're going to come for yours next.
[00:13:03.314 --> 00:13:06.255]  So they tried to get an establishment Attorney General in there.
[00:13:06.275 --> 00:13:11.277]  I believe it was George Bush, not George W. I think it was George P. It was a brother-in-law or something.
[00:13:11.817 --> 00:13:12.537]  You know, the old deal.
[00:13:13.517 --> 00:13:14.478]  And they couldn't get him in.
[00:13:14.698 --> 00:13:19.259]  And so now they're just trying to reverse the results of that election and get Paxson out via impeachment.
[00:13:19.319 --> 00:13:22.800]  And the Republican Party went along for the ride because it's got so many problems here.
[00:13:26.661 --> 00:13:27.822]  The culture wars.
[00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.311]  Will we, we, we'll, what do you even call it?
[00:13:31.371 --> 00:13:36.294]  Will we be conquered by the LGBTQ pedophile plus propaganda?
[00:13:37.294 --> 00:13:47.459]  Or can we just go back to normal where you, you know, you can go out to dinner or go to the gym or go to a ball game or turn on the television and not get overwhelmed with sexual propaganda aimed at children?
[00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:50.701]  That battle is on.
[00:13:50.741 --> 00:13:55.884]  We've got some examples of victories.
[00:13:56.084 --> 00:13:57.825]  You've got some examples of losses.
[00:13:59.209 --> 00:14:01.071]  We're going to cover that as well.
[00:14:01.351 --> 00:14:09.079]  It's sad, but every time I come on air on Sunday, one of the top stories always every weekend is the weekend violence.
[00:14:11.181 --> 00:14:12.783]  And it's just the same story this weekend.
[00:14:14.444 --> 00:14:25.124]   Always in the Democrat cities is where they have the problems from San Francisco, Seattle, Washington D.C., Baltimore, New York, Chicago.
[00:14:26.145 --> 00:14:26.585]  Yikes.
[00:14:26.905 --> 00:14:28.226]  Already Memorial Day shootings.
[00:14:28.266 --> 00:14:29.106]  It's always bad.
[00:14:29.507 --> 00:14:31.548]  Then the summer kicks off, it just gets worse.
[00:14:32.248 --> 00:14:38.953]  These are all gun-free zones, by the way, run by Democrats, but they seem to have the worst problems with gun violence.
[00:14:39.073 --> 00:14:39.473]  Funny, innit?
[00:14:41.803 --> 00:14:54.576]  But now, today's show headline is about how the dam is breaking and the establishment's grip on even the minds of the most brainwashed leftists is starting to slip, and it's the war issue that's starting to bring them back down to earth.
[00:14:55.732 --> 00:14:58.453]  Major protests at an AOC event this weekend.
[00:14:58.533 --> 00:15:01.495]  By the way, Justin Trudeau can't even go out in public anymore.
[00:15:02.375 --> 00:15:08.238]  And then Tulsi Gabbard goes on cable news over the weekend and says the Democrats are an elitist cabal of warmongers.
[00:15:09.178 --> 00:15:20.604]  So this Biden war in Ukraine, this illegal war that Biden has launched against Russia, is bringing far-left liberal progressives back down to earth, folks.
[00:15:22.086 --> 00:15:27.850]  And to their credit, they're going after the Democrats in their local districts, calling them out for it.
[00:15:28.891 --> 00:15:34.515]  So we've got all that and more on tonight's edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:34.636 --> 00:15:37.978]  Owens Royer, honored to be spending this Sunday evening with you.
[00:15:38.238 --> 00:15:39.399]  Forget about the polls.
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.281]  Forget even about elections.
[00:15:43.862 --> 00:16:01.461]   It's pretty easy to see now The left-wing ideology and all of its overwhelming propaganda seeping into the consciousness, into the everyday life of the average American, is being rejected.
[00:16:02.822 --> 00:16:10.844]  And the far-left extremism, the weaponization of government, hell, just the blatant corruption of its political leaders.
[00:16:14.685 --> 00:16:26.149]   The American left is Taking on water, if you want to use that analogy, or it's losing air, if you want to use that analogy, it's... It was always going to fail.
[00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:28.510]  It was always just going to be momentary.
[00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.531]  It was always just going to be a trend.
[00:16:31.612 --> 00:16:36.315]  But it's starting to be realized what it really represented, what was really behind it.
[00:16:37.256 --> 00:16:41.418]  And all these things they claim to represent, and all these things they claim to be for, they never were.
[00:16:42.579 --> 00:16:43.380]  Anti-war.
[00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:46.960]  Anti-racism, all this other garbage.
[00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:50.643]  Anti-centralization, anti-big government.
[00:16:51.483 --> 00:16:52.444]  They're pro all of it.
[00:16:53.725 --> 00:16:55.246]  And so we see examples of this.
[00:16:56.646 --> 00:17:05.492]  First though, it's getting obvious, whether you like Donald Trump or not, that guy goes around, he's popular.
[00:17:05.552 --> 00:17:08.694]  He doesn't have to beg for cheers like Dr. Jill Biden.
[00:17:09.334 --> 00:17:13.497]  Dr. Jill channels Jeb Bush, awkwardly begs audience to clap.
[00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.231]  Because, you know, she's so popular.
[00:17:16.851 --> 00:17:18.132]  Joe Biden's America.
[00:17:18.232 --> 00:17:20.993]  Price of ketchup, mustard, and relish skyrocket.
[00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:24.654]  Oh, your Memorial Day barbecue weekend probably doubled in price.
[00:17:26.115 --> 00:17:31.538]  I'm to the point now where it's like I'm just praying that gas is less than $4 a gallon here in Austin, Texas.
[00:17:31.578 --> 00:17:32.198]  It's above that.
[00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:34.419]  It was, what, like $2 when Trump left?
[00:17:35.059 --> 00:17:35.439]  It was nice.
[00:17:35.459 --> 00:17:37.260]  You could fill your tank for like $40, $50.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.481]  Not in Biden's America.
[00:17:39.381 --> 00:17:45.786]  Dianne Feinstein relies heavily on army of staffers and includes Pelosi's daughter, bless her heart.
[00:17:47.047 --> 00:17:56.274]  Although some believe that's because she's trying to win favor for Adam Schiff to take Feinstein's seat.
[00:17:57.595 --> 00:18:00.997]  Feinstein, Feinstein relies heavily on army of staffers to function.
[00:18:01.517 --> 00:18:08.692]   Aides have to whisper in her ear between votes as if she has any idea Oh, so you mean like Joe Biden who can't wipe his own butt?
[00:18:09.513 --> 00:18:14.415]  Or John Fetterman who apparently is so depressed he can't even take a hoodie off?
[00:18:15.315 --> 00:18:16.476]  Or his gym shorts off?
[00:18:16.716 --> 00:18:17.476]  Must be tough.
[00:18:20.418 --> 00:18:27.049]   And so that's why Tulsi Gabbard Calls the Democrat Party an elitist cabal of warmongers.
[00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:28.970]  And it's starting to catch up to them, folks.
[00:18:29.871 --> 00:18:33.594]  AOC has an event in New York City this weekend.
[00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:39.258]  Many of her constituents show up and shout her down and protest her for supporting war.
[00:18:39.699 --> 00:18:41.000]  This is getting common now.
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.203]  At leftist Democrat events, their constituents protesting them.
[00:18:45.503 --> 00:18:46.364]  You love to see it.
[00:18:46.764 --> 00:18:47.205]  Here it is.
[00:18:51.474 --> 00:18:56.100]  Next we're going to clear a war with Russia.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.401]  We're sending Epstein.
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:16.260]  [crowd shouting]
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.260]  Yeah, get out!
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.581]  We don't like people that can think for themselves.
[00:19:20.101 --> 00:19:21.782]  We don't like people that are anti-war.
[00:19:21.842 --> 00:19:23.002]  We're the liberals now.
[00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:24.462]  We're pro-war.
[00:19:24.482 --> 00:19:26.983]  As long as we're the ones dropping the bombs.
[00:19:28.904 --> 00:19:31.705]  As long as we're the ones doing the killing, it's okay.
[00:19:32.225 --> 00:19:34.246]  I'm a progressive liberal democrat.
[00:19:34.686 --> 00:19:37.927]  And I'm anti-war, unless it's me doing the killing.
[00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:40.268]  Me doing the killing is a good thing.
[00:19:41.493 --> 00:19:43.533]  There's one lady's sign that says AOC is a criminal.
[00:19:44.214 --> 00:19:47.915]  Here's a Cuban immigrant upset over the illegal immigrants draining into their city.
[00:19:47.955 --> 00:19:48.915]  Go ahead and pump the audio.
[00:19:50.634 --> 00:20:00.634]  [CROSSTALK]
[00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:06.894]  Now they're getting into security.
[00:20:06.894 --> 00:20:16.894]  [CROSSTALK]
[00:20:19.914 --> 00:20:21.914]  This is common sense stuff, folks.
[00:20:21.914 --> 00:20:28.264]   *laughing* And they're realizing the left, their leaders either have no common sense or they're just entirely corrupt.
[00:20:29.905 --> 00:20:32.328]  There's all the brainwashed minions of the Democrat Party.
[00:20:33.837 --> 00:20:35.880]  Common sense is to be anti-war.
[00:20:36.681 --> 00:20:39.285]  Common sense is that American citizens should come first.
[00:20:39.465 --> 00:20:40.787]  That's common sense stuff.
[00:20:41.708 --> 00:20:45.233]  The President has come out saying that he also believes that he has this authority.
[00:20:46.497 --> 00:20:53.122]  What he has also said is that he is not sure if he is able to implement the authority in time for the June 5th deadline.
[00:20:53.722 --> 00:20:58.446]  And so, that is where we see kind of this impasse.
[00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:06.472]  I still believe, first of all, that we should start to implement it anyway because we should eliminate the debt limit in the United States.
[00:21:06.792 --> 00:21:08.233]  Have no debt limit!
[00:21:08.173 --> 00:21:09.173]  Oh, good, Commie.
[00:21:09.173 --> 00:21:21.813]  I don't like that.
[00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:26.333]   I don't like that Republicans passed a 1.7 trillion tax cut on the wealthy.
[00:21:26.396 --> 00:21:28.777]  They hate tax cuts.
[00:21:28.797 --> 00:21:30.098]  They want you to pay more in taxes.
[00:21:30.738 --> 00:21:35.020]  What kind of a jerk wants to pay more in taxes?
[00:21:39.226 --> 00:21:40.387]  This guy's got a mask on.
[00:21:40.427 --> 00:21:41.709]  Here's AOC's biggest supporter.
[00:21:41.729 --> 00:21:42.550]  He's got his face mask.
[00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.911]  Still afraid of a virus.
[00:21:43.951 --> 00:21:45.033]  He does have a chin strap though.
[00:21:46.314 --> 00:21:50.955]  That is exactly why we use a paper slip.
[00:21:50.995 --> 00:21:53.376]  We are at war with Russia.
[00:21:53.416 --> 00:21:55.477]  We're sending EPSIC.
[00:21:55.396 --> 00:22:15.396]  [crowd noise]
[00:22:15.396 --> 00:22:19.396]   See, the one lady who knows what she's talking about, they want her out.
[00:22:19.374 --> 00:22:20.415]  Notice that?
[00:22:20.775 --> 00:22:25.578]  The people that actually know what they're talking about, the brainwashed minions want out of the room.
[00:22:26.139 --> 00:22:26.699]  That's what they want.
[00:22:26.739 --> 00:22:28.340]  They want a room full of morons.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.261]  They want a room full of brainwashed minions.
[00:22:30.281 --> 00:22:32.723]  They don't like informed people that can think for themselves.
[00:22:34.544 --> 00:22:36.105]  It's invasion of the body snatchers.
[00:22:40.984 --> 00:22:43.545]  I can't believe how many people are still wearing face masks in this crowd.
[00:22:43.565 --> 00:22:47.387]  ...creating a lot of harm to poor indigenous people.
[00:22:47.488 --> 00:22:49.829]  And we've also been able to... Are you guys vets?
[00:22:50.309 --> 00:22:50.549]  No.
[00:22:50.749 --> 00:22:51.530]  Did you serve?
[00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.351]  I are, I am.
[00:22:54.371 --> 00:22:54.771]  20 years.
[00:22:55.472 --> 00:22:57.133]  Alright, please stop using the red hair.
[00:22:58.653 --> 00:23:05.653]  I served in Iraq.
[00:23:05.653 --> 00:23:10.413]   They love the veterans now but they kneel for the anthem spit on the flag tell you how bad America is.
[00:23:10.413 --> 00:23:13.453]  [APPLAUSE]
[00:23:13.433 --> 00:23:16.195]  No, no, please, please.
[00:23:16.235 --> 00:23:20.177]  Because the fact is, immigrants have nothing to do with vets.
[00:23:21.318 --> 00:23:22.519]  It's just an excuse.
[00:23:23.079 --> 00:23:28.923]  If you want to talk, like I said... So AOC has her handlers in there.
[00:23:29.043 --> 00:23:31.305]  Trying to correct the record because people were complaining.
[00:23:32.445 --> 00:23:36.188]  People were complaining about how... See, here he comes again.
[00:23:38.297 --> 00:23:39.958]  Let the veterans speak!
[00:23:40.178 --> 00:23:41.039]  Let the veterans speak!
[00:23:41.079 --> 00:23:45.461]  So people are complaining, oh they want to hear from the veteran now, but not when they tell you to stand for the national anthem.
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.001]  This is how they try to correct the course here.
[00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:52.481]  They kicked out veterans.
[00:23:52.661 --> 00:23:55.882]  They kicked out homeless veterans in a hotel in New York City.
[00:23:55.922 --> 00:23:58.943]  They kicked out the veterans and they gave those rooms to illegal immigrants.
[00:23:59.303 --> 00:24:00.603]  That's exactly what happened.
[00:24:01.204 --> 00:24:08.166]  And then they have these Democrat handlers up there because AOC can't handle the heat to say, veterans have nothing to do with migrants.
[00:24:08.426 --> 00:24:13.947]  Oh, until they get kicked to the curb so an illegal immigrant can get their room at the fancy hotel in New York City.
[00:24:14.427 --> 00:24:15.127]  Yeah, nice try.
[00:24:15.227 --> 00:24:16.768]  No, the constituency threw that.
[00:24:17.879 --> 00:24:24.784]  AOC, not the only radical leftist, Marxist commie that's getting protested by our own constituents.
[00:24:24.864 --> 00:24:34.411]  Justin Trudeau, unfortunately for him and his security team, hasn't really been able to walk the streets in public at all for years now.
[00:24:34.891 --> 00:24:38.794]  And now when he does public events they have to shut down whole city blocks and make sure that he's isolated.
[00:24:39.455 --> 00:24:42.297]  This happened to Justin Trudeau over the weekend.
[00:24:42.317 --> 00:24:43.538]  He was just walking the sidewalks.
[00:24:44.298 --> 00:24:51.458]   Woodstock Ontario and it sounded like this You
[00:24:51.458 --> 00:25:01.458]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:25:01.458 --> 00:25:02.977]  Fuck you.
[00:25:02.977 --> 00:25:04.817]  Fuck you.
[00:25:04.817 --> 00:25:06.577]  Fuck you.
[00:25:06.577 --> 00:25:07.497]  You can't.
[00:25:07.497 --> 00:25:09.497]  You can't.
[00:25:09.497 --> 00:25:11.097]  Turn it off.
[00:25:11.097 --> 00:25:12.097]  Turn it off.
[00:25:12.126 --> 00:25:12.546]  RUDOLPH!
[00:25:14.907 --> 00:25:15.447]  RUDOLPH!
[00:25:18.107 --> 00:25:18.327]  RUDOLPH!
[00:25:19.768 --> 00:25:23.687]   You can fill the blank for yourself there don't have to get too creative
[00:25:23.687 --> 00:25:27.687]   You guys have been rude all day You guys have been rude all day
[00:25:27.687 --> 00:25:31.687]   I'm glad I didn't f*** you (Crowd cheering)
[00:25:31.687 --> 00:25:35.687]   F*** you F*** you
[00:25:35.687 --> 00:25:39.688]   F*** you Never liked you to begin with
[00:25:39.688 --> 00:25:43.688]   F*** you buddy What?
[00:25:43.688 --> 00:25:45.688]  What?
[00:25:45.301 --> 00:25:48.645]  I don't like you, buddy!
[00:25:48.685 --> 00:25:48.885]  What?
[00:25:48.965 --> 00:25:50.687]  I'm touching all of it.
[00:25:50.747 --> 00:25:52.629]  They have no respect at all.
[00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:55.192]  You're gonna call me like that?
[00:25:55.212 --> 00:25:56.293]  Yeah, I'm gonna.
[00:25:56.213 --> 00:25:58.713]  (crowd noise)
[00:25:58.713 --> 00:25:59.713]  Thank you.
[00:25:59.713 --> 00:26:00.713]  Please do.
[00:26:00.713 --> 00:26:01.713]  Thank you.
[00:26:01.713 --> 00:26:01.713]  Please do.
[00:26:01.713 --> 00:26:03.354]  I'm not going there. - Please don't.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.342]  You were probably there beating us in Ottawa too, weren't you?
[00:26:06.362 --> 00:26:07.623]  You probably liked it too, didn't you?
[00:26:07.643 --> 00:26:08.744]  Wow, this is a jerk security guard.
[00:26:08.764 --> 00:26:10.685]  Celebrates beating Canadians and arresting them.
[00:26:10.544 --> 00:26:13.943]   You were probably there beating us in Ottawa too, weren't you?
[00:26:13.943 --> 00:26:14.944]  Paid for the pool.
[00:26:14.944 --> 00:26:17.383]  You probably liked it too, didn't you?
[00:26:17.383 --> 00:26:18.383]  Paid for my pool.
[00:26:18.383 --> 00:26:19.383]  You probably liked it getting beaten.
[00:26:19.383 --> 00:26:21.823]  Wow, this is a jerk security guard.
[00:26:21.823 --> 00:26:22.824]  You know that?
[00:26:22.824 --> 00:26:23.824]  Paid for my pool.
[00:26:23.824 --> 00:26:27.344]  Celebrates beating Canadians and arresting them.
[00:26:27.344 --> 00:26:30.304]  He says it's good, it pays for his pool.
[00:26:30.867 --> 00:26:32.368]  To beat your citizens.
[00:26:32.768 --> 00:26:34.389]  And you're telling me you're happy that he did that?
[00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:36.591]  He is, he's got a nice pool.
[00:26:36.611 --> 00:26:37.511]  It's good to be a commie.
[00:26:37.972 --> 00:26:38.492]  You get rich.
[00:26:38.512 --> 00:26:40.293]  Just took me in for laying on the ground.
[00:26:40.493 --> 00:26:44.356]  It's amazing how becoming a commie you usually become massively wealthy.
[00:26:45.057 --> 00:26:46.258]  And never share the wealth either.
[00:26:46.278 --> 00:26:48.399]  Who are you?
[00:26:48.519 --> 00:26:49.800]  Like, what's your name?
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.741]  Isn't that something?
[00:26:51.141 --> 00:26:52.142]  Thanks, see you next time.
[00:26:52.302 --> 00:26:53.323]  Isn't that something?
[00:26:54.223 --> 00:26:57.766]  All these modern day western commies, they sure get rich.
[00:26:59.377 --> 00:27:00.918]  They get filthy rich!
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.321]  And they never distribute the wealth.
[00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:07.162]  They always want to take your money, though.
[00:27:07.583 --> 00:27:09.184]  They want to redistribute your money.
[00:27:09.624 --> 00:27:13.147]  Of course, that's just another word for steal, isn't it?
[00:27:14.848 --> 00:27:15.108]  Mm-hmm.
[00:27:18.951 --> 00:27:20.372]  It's starting to catch on, folks.
[00:27:21.292 --> 00:27:22.393]  It's starting to catch on.
[00:27:23.854 --> 00:27:35.477]   I mean, in a way, the American left has done this for themselves because They also have hyper-polarized things, but also made their voters hyper-aware.
[00:27:36.599 --> 00:27:41.866]  And for years they've been looking around street corners for Nazis and white supremacists, and it's finally starting to catch up.
[00:27:42.026 --> 00:27:42.928]  You know, wait a second.
[00:27:44.704 --> 00:27:56.752]  You know, I'm not fine in Nazis, white supremacists, they're not really my problem, but you know, my energy bill is going up, and my grocery bill is going up, and gas prices keep going up, and gee, now they're starting a war and I'm supposed to pay for it?
[00:27:56.812 --> 00:27:57.312]  What the heck?
[00:27:57.372 --> 00:27:58.293]  What's going on here?
[00:27:59.013 --> 00:28:05.897]  All these people that were for the little guy, all these people that said they would redistribute the wealth, they keep getting richer, I keep getting poorer!
[00:28:06.598 --> 00:28:07.598]  What is going on here?
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:10.340]  Yeah.
[00:28:11.541 --> 00:28:13.202]  It's starting to catch on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:14.574 --> 00:28:15.494]  It's starting to catch on.
[00:28:15.974 --> 00:28:22.337]  And you know something else that's starting to catch on, you've probably seen this going on, you've been aware of this, and that's the health revolution.
[00:28:22.417 --> 00:28:31.700]  Taking back control of your health, whether that's just because you want to be as healthy as possible, or you've realized, I don't want to have to go to the hospital or go see a doctor.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.201]  Those are like the last place you want to be right now.
[00:28:36.321 --> 00:28:43.871]   And so people are taking their health back into their own hands, and one of the ways we're trying to help with this effort Is fill the voids.
[00:28:44.531 --> 00:28:49.215]  It's well known that many Americans are deficient in iodine.
[00:28:49.235 --> 00:28:52.897]  In fact, this has been a phenomenon for a long time, the iodine deficiency.
[00:28:53.538 --> 00:28:54.578]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:28:54.979 --> 00:29:01.043]  And so we try to give you a solution to that problem at Infowarsstore.com.

[00:30:33.363 --> 00:30:33.904]  All right.
[00:30:36.557 --> 00:30:48.557]   Let's just cover some random headlines here before we really get focused on the other side of this break.
[00:30:48.557 --> 00:30:54.596]   It's really sick what's being done to the political prisoners, the politically persecuted in the United States
[00:30:54.596 --> 00:30:58.557]   of America, by the American left, the Democrats.
[00:30:58.971 --> 00:31:00.512]  The story is at Gateway Pundit.
[00:31:00.552 --> 00:31:07.835]  Government is taking donations from January 6th prisoners so their families starve and they lose everything and so defendants cannot afford attorneys.
[00:31:07.875 --> 00:31:11.557]  Folks, this is, these are oppressive communists.
[00:31:11.577 --> 00:31:13.297]  These are oppressive fascists.
[00:31:13.637 --> 00:31:14.318]  That's what this is.
[00:31:14.358 --> 00:31:15.178]  These are fascists.
[00:31:17.159 --> 00:31:19.740]  And the Associated Press is reporting this.
[00:31:22.181 --> 00:31:27.604]  Over 90% of the January 6th defendants are low to middle class and cannot afford private attorneys.
[00:31:28.832 --> 00:31:38.195]  And at least 80% of the FBI arrests were of protesters who were waved in to the Capitol on January 6th and committed no violence.
[00:31:38.275 --> 00:31:49.438]  And these fascists are sitting there trying to shut down their ability to fundraise, shut down their ability to get a lawyer, and shut down their ability to fight back against the corrupt government establishment.
[00:31:50.515 --> 00:31:51.435]  This is fascism.
[00:31:51.515 --> 00:31:52.636]  This is authoritarianism.
[00:31:52.736 --> 00:31:54.497]  This is oppression from the U.S.
[00:31:54.517 --> 00:31:54.877]  government.
[00:31:55.657 --> 00:31:56.477]  And it's really sad.
[00:31:56.517 --> 00:31:58.218]  We've never seen the U.S.
[00:31:58.258 --> 00:32:02.920]  government be weaponized against the American people so much as we are today.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:20.368]   And the January 6th political prisoners and the politically persecuted are the case study that hopefully We will learn from and never engage in such tyranny against the American people ever again.
[00:32:21.869 --> 00:32:25.031]  Not enough of an issue raised on that.
[00:32:25.812 --> 00:32:28.453]  Meanwhile, though, they got plenty of help for the illegal immigrants.
[00:32:28.533 --> 00:32:30.574]  Those people get waived in and not charged.
[00:32:30.614 --> 00:32:32.335]  You get waived into the Capitol, you get charged.
[00:32:32.375 --> 00:32:34.156]  You get waived into the country, you get everything for free.
[00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:42.374]  Migrants allowed to enroll in Chicago schools without health records after years of draconian COVID rules.
[00:32:42.675 --> 00:32:46.838]  And they kept these COVID rules really up through this school year, folks.
[00:32:47.338 --> 00:32:49.300]  Through this school year in Chicago.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.502]  Because those liberal teachers up there were lazy and didn't want to go back.
[00:32:52.562 --> 00:32:53.983]  But nonetheless, they did it anyway.
[00:32:54.764 --> 00:33:00.889]  But now illegal immigrants can walk right in and walk right into the classroom with no health records at all.
[00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:03.291]  Kind of like in Minnesota.
[00:33:04.295 --> 00:33:10.079]  They've got their little communist healthcare system up there, but it's only supposed to be for citizens of the state.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:10.960]  Not anymore!
[00:33:11.821 --> 00:33:12.541]  Not anymore!
[00:33:12.601 --> 00:33:18.166]  The illegal immigrants are pouring in, and they're allowed to sign right up for that healthcare in Minnesota.
[00:33:20.468 --> 00:33:21.648]  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:23.950]  And you're just supposed to take it?
[00:33:24.891 --> 00:33:26.392]  And you're just supposed to accept it?
[00:33:27.273 --> 00:33:31.016]  Your money getting stolen and given to non-citizens?
[00:33:32.312 --> 00:33:32.832]  The U.S.
[00:33:32.892 --> 00:33:45.456]  government persecuting innocent Americans that go against the Democrat establishment while they're letting in their replacement voter blocks at the southern border and now the northern border.
[00:33:45.836 --> 00:33:51.817]  Well, the coddling of Vladimir Zelensky in Ukraine by the U.S.
[00:33:51.898 --> 00:33:56.279]  media and our corrupt politicians continues to just get more disgusting.
[00:33:57.398 --> 00:34:11.090]  Even with Hollywood losers going over there and glad-handing Zelensky, who really, if you look at this, has been probably the worst leader in the history of Ukraine.
[00:34:12.712 --> 00:34:16.595]  Has there ever been more bloodshed and suffering and destruction in Ukraine?
[00:34:18.396 --> 00:34:23.301]  More so than during Zelensky's time as president?
[00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:27.705]  It's actually disgusting.
[00:34:28.605 --> 00:34:29.606]  The people supporting this.
[00:34:31.187 --> 00:34:32.467]  It's actually disgusting.
[00:34:33.108 --> 00:34:35.669]  The people claiming there's been any victories for Ukraine in this.
[00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.890]  It's sick.
[00:34:38.451 --> 00:34:45.855]  But this might be maybe the most disgusting thing you've ever heard said about it from a US politician.
[00:34:45.975 --> 00:34:47.155]  It's Lindsey Graham.
[00:34:48.136 --> 00:34:49.897]  This man is truly disgusting.
[00:34:49.937 --> 00:34:51.318]  This man is deranged.
[00:34:51.858 --> 00:34:55.140]  Sounds like a psycho killer here in clip 12.
[00:34:56.852 --> 00:34:57.152]  Free or die.
[00:34:57.812 --> 00:34:58.292]  Free or die.
[00:34:58.933 --> 00:34:59.633]  Now you are free.
[00:35:00.213 --> 00:35:00.473]  Yes.
[00:35:00.613 --> 00:35:01.273]  And we will be.
[00:35:01.513 --> 00:35:02.513]  And the Russians are dying.
[00:35:03.094 --> 00:35:04.834]  It's the best money we've ever spent.
[00:35:06.094 --> 00:35:07.615]  Thank you so much.
[00:35:10.055 --> 00:35:11.676]  And now the Russians are dying.
[00:35:11.756 --> 00:35:13.356]  It's the best money we've ever spent.
[00:35:14.516 --> 00:35:19.978]  To the Russians out there, I apologize for Lindsey Graham being a warmongering piece of shit.
[00:35:20.914 --> 00:35:23.717]  I apologize and he's one of many in the U.S.
[00:35:23.757 --> 00:35:26.299]  government that we should all apologize for.
[00:35:26.419 --> 00:35:34.786]  We should as a nation be apologizing for the sick warmongering that comes out of D.C.
[00:35:36.991 --> 00:36:00.642]  The whole world has sat here and watched us allow these warmongers like Lindsey Graham to blow up foreign countries, run coups in foreign elections, and now Lindsey Graham, because that little pussy has never been put in his place, sits there next to Zelensky like a tough guy and says, we've killed Russians, best money we've ever spent.
[00:36:01.062 --> 00:36:03.364]  Why don't you go over there and fight Russians, Lindsey?
[00:36:05.164 --> 00:36:05.985]  You little bitch.
[00:36:07.816 --> 00:36:11.157]  Lindsey's never seen a war that he didn't want someone else to die in.
[00:36:12.418 --> 00:36:18.981]  How much stock do you think Lindsey Graham has in Lockheed Martin and Raytheon and other weapons contractors and manufacturers?
[00:36:19.241 --> 00:36:20.101]  I'd like to know.
[00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:21.262]  Would you?
[00:36:22.942 --> 00:36:25.543]  Why is Lindsey Graham celebrating dead Russians?
[00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:32.506]  By the way, it's probably about four times as many Ukrainians that have died as Russians.
[00:36:33.046 --> 00:36:36.108]  Is that good to Lindsey Graham?
[00:36:37.378 --> 00:36:38.419]  Is that a good number?
[00:36:38.499 --> 00:36:44.401]  How many Ukrainians have to die for Lindsey Graham to sit across that table from Zelensky and have a shit-eating grin on his face?
[00:36:44.482 --> 00:36:46.543]  I'm sorry, I've cussed too many times, we're probably out of dump.
[00:36:46.943 --> 00:36:47.383]  But hey!
[00:36:49.924 --> 00:36:55.707]  Hey, Lindsey Graham is pleased that people are dying in Ukraine.
[00:36:55.727 --> 00:36:56.507]  He doesn't care.
[00:36:56.547 --> 00:36:59.669]  It's the best money that we've ever spent, says Lindsey Graham.
[00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:03.591]  That is... that is...
[00:37:05.604 --> 00:37:08.887]  Mad, evil, villain, genocidal rhetoric.
[00:37:10.649 --> 00:37:12.150]  With a smile on his face.
[00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:16.594]  It's embarrassing.
[00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:27.015]  Congress to investigate World Health Organization plans to use listening surveillance systems to identify misinformation.
[00:37:27.135 --> 00:37:32.798]  Oh yes, but remember Joe Biden wants to sign over our sovereignty to the World Health Organization.
[00:37:32.838 --> 00:37:35.500]  So of course they should be allowed to spy on you.
[00:37:37.141 --> 00:37:39.563]  I mean golly gee, the serpent.
[00:37:42.484 --> 00:37:45.186]  The World Health Organization serpent over the flat earth.
[00:37:45.206 --> 00:37:46.387]  What are they flat earthers too?
[00:37:46.427 --> 00:37:47.768]  What kind of propaganda is this?
[00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:54.311]  The evil on earth, the World Health Organization, big pharmaceutical companies.
[00:37:55.612 --> 00:37:57.212]  Why would they need to listen to you?
[00:37:59.012 --> 00:38:02.834]  Because it's not about health, it's about dominance and control.
[00:38:03.374 --> 00:38:07.835]  COVID-style lockdowns to be imposed by UK, by World Health Organization under new treaty.
[00:38:08.275 --> 00:38:09.435]  Same thing they want to do here.
[00:38:09.775 --> 00:38:11.956]  At least some resistance is coming from Congress.
[00:38:13.857 --> 00:38:15.417]  But what's really going on in Ukraine?
[00:38:17.878 --> 00:38:18.819]  What's Russia up to?
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:27.832]  Avian flu pathogens with 40% kill rate in humans found at US Biolab in Ukraine, according to the Russian government.
[00:38:28.979 --> 00:38:34.921]  Russia has accused the United States of experimenting with avian flu pathogens at a U.S.
[00:38:34.981 --> 00:38:38.162]  biolab in Ukraine with up to 40% lethality rate in humans.
[00:38:38.423 --> 00:38:50.167]  The Russian Ministry of Defense released a statement on Friday claiming it has recovered deadly samples of avian flu virus strains with high potential for epidemic spread at a U.S.
[00:38:50.227 --> 00:38:53.048]  biolab in the Kherson region of Ukraine.
[00:38:54.935 --> 00:38:58.696]  Oh, is that why Kherson was such an important region for Ukraine to defend?
[00:38:58.716 --> 00:38:59.477]  And then they lost it?
[00:38:59.997 --> 00:39:01.817]  And now the biolabs have been found?
[00:39:02.077 --> 00:39:08.720]  Which Victoria Nuland confirmed, first denied, but then we found their online documents that were public, and then they had to admit it.
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.240]  Oh wait, we do have the biolabs there.
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:11.481]  It was all public.
[00:39:11.501 --> 00:39:14.562]  Kind of like Joe Biden at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:39:14.802 --> 00:39:19.023]  Hell yeah, I bribed Ukraine to fire the investigator investigating my son.
[00:39:20.644 --> 00:39:23.665]  And then, of course, they've put this out with the evidence.
[00:39:25.871 --> 00:39:26.572]  Russia, that is.
[00:39:28.053 --> 00:39:34.358]  Read in full briefing by the Russian Ministry of Defense on U.S.
[00:39:34.398 --> 00:39:46.488]  military biological activity, evidence of the research of dangerous pathogens in Ukraine, development of biological weapons by the United States, establishment of BSL-4 biolabs abroad by the United States.
[00:39:46.628 --> 00:39:50.531]  All of it is real, whether you love or hate Russia, whatever you feel about this war, it's all real.
[00:39:52.037 --> 00:39:53.577]  It's in the U.S.
[00:39:53.597 --> 00:39:54.998]  State Department documents, folks.
[00:39:55.018 --> 00:39:56.358]  This isn't Russian propaganda.
[00:39:57.619 --> 00:40:00.820]  The State Department had this information public.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.041]  They bragged about these biolabs.
[00:40:04.061 --> 00:40:07.222]  They bragged about the military biological weapons labs in Ukraine.
[00:40:07.242 --> 00:40:07.882]  It's no secret.
[00:40:08.362 --> 00:40:16.004]  And it's directly connected to the... drumroll... Biden crime family!
[00:40:17.985 --> 00:40:18.665]  With Hunter Biden.
[00:40:20.327 --> 00:40:23.169]  And his international business dealings.
[00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:47.604]  Where, by the way, there's a major, call it a cold war, happening inside the federal government with FBI whistleblowers who have seen the Biden crime family documents and are aghast, stunned, stunned that Christopher Wray and Merrick Garland have taken no action.
[00:40:49.093 --> 00:40:55.754]  And you got to understand, these are people that sat there and watched the criminal persecution of Donald Trump for years with no evidence.
[00:40:56.795 --> 00:40:58.875]  And perhaps said nothing because they didn't want to ruffle feathers.
[00:40:59.075 --> 00:41:01.015]  Well, now there's actual evidence of crimes.
[00:41:03.136 --> 00:41:08.837]  And it's Joe Biden and Garland and Wray are making sure to cover it up.
[00:41:10.277 --> 00:41:13.498]  Making sure nothing happens, just like they did for Hillary Clinton.
[00:41:14.598 --> 00:41:18.239]  And of course, there's the Barack Obama angle of all of this because his fingerprints are over.
[00:41:19.746 --> 00:41:23.990]  All over the Russian collusion hoax as well.
[00:41:26.071 --> 00:41:36.119]  But getting back to the issue, so why is the World Health Organization warning of a biological outbreak, another pandemic?
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:55.913]   And I would say if there's a window of opportunity for the globalist, if there's a window of opportunity for the deep state, they're going to feel they're in it right now and They'll blame Russia if there's any sort of biological release or new pandemic.
[00:41:56.533 --> 00:41:57.474]  Now here's the problem.
[00:41:59.294 --> 00:42:03.275]  Now they might not care because they assume the American people are so stupid they can't put two and two together.
[00:42:06.476 --> 00:42:08.317]  But how are they going to get around that now?
[00:42:09.449 --> 00:42:16.815]  If there's another biological release, another pandemic, while denying that they had any of the labs in Ukraine, because that's going to be what they say.
[00:42:16.835 --> 00:42:24.381]  They're going to say Russia went into the labs in Ukraine that we didn't have, and they blew them up, and they blew up the containment, and the viruses got out because of Russia.
[00:42:24.601 --> 00:42:28.144]  But also, those labs didn't exist, and we had nothing to do with those labs.
[00:42:28.384 --> 00:42:30.906]  Those were not our biological weapons labs.
[00:42:31.526 --> 00:42:35.269]  But Russia also went into our biological weapons labs, blew them up, and spread a virus.
[00:42:35.389 --> 00:42:36.250]  But they don't exist.
[00:42:38.194 --> 00:42:47.787]  Now, of course, they would run with that propaganda, but let's just keep our eyes peeled for that.
[00:42:48.909 --> 00:42:54.696]  So, Russia could have either stopped the next biological release, or they're going to release it and blame Russia.
[00:42:56.032 --> 00:42:57.493]  But of course, this is all to do what?
[00:42:58.094 --> 00:43:06.040]  Put you into fear, and then put you into control, and then give you the vaccine that, well, doesn't work so well.
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:07.641]  Maybe it had something to do with this.
[00:43:08.561 --> 00:43:16.147]  LSU's Samaya Smith faints during White House visit with Biden, took her six minutes to recover and get her out of there in a wheelchair.
[00:43:16.207 --> 00:43:17.308]  They say she'll be fine.
[00:43:17.448 --> 00:43:18.189]  What happened to her?
[00:43:19.946 --> 00:43:23.207]  Teen dies after medical emergency during swim meet.
[00:43:24.068 --> 00:43:29.210]  Just days from big accomplishment and so the story continues like you've never seen it before.
[00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:31.131]  Young athletes.
[00:43:32.952 --> 00:43:38.554]  Young athletes just dropping dead out of nowhere.
[00:43:41.736 --> 00:43:42.516]  It's all over the place.
[00:43:45.277 --> 00:43:52.430]   Been covering it for years unfortunately and it all started happening coincidentally After the COVID-19 vaccine.
[00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:54.932]  But don't you dare suggest that.
[00:43:55.272 --> 00:44:00.898]  And don't you dare go to the VAERS reporting website that shows that the COVID-19 vaccine is the deadliest vaccine in U.S.
[00:44:00.918 --> 00:44:01.298]  history.
[00:44:01.618 --> 00:44:03.420]  And by the way, it's not even close.
[00:44:04.381 --> 00:44:06.263]  It's the Michael Jordan of deadly vaccines.
[00:44:06.323 --> 00:44:07.965]  It's the Babe Ruth of deadly vaccines.
[00:44:07.825 --> 00:44:10.425]  and they forced you to take it.
[00:44:10.425 --> 00:44:13.185]  (dramatic music)
[00:44:13.185 --> 00:44:27.945]  Sold out for more than a year.

[00:45:40.096 --> 00:45:43.037]  WOKE is supposed to advance equity in Europe.
[00:45:43.077 --> 00:45:46.418]  The definition of equity comes from the public administration literature.
[00:45:46.898 --> 00:45:49.198]  It was written by a man named George Fredrickson.
[00:45:49.398 --> 00:45:57.040]  And the definition is an administered political economy in which shares are adjusted so that citizens are made equal.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:02.046]   They're going to administer an economy to make Shares equal.
[00:46:02.646 --> 00:46:08.690]  The only difference between equity and socialism is the type of property that they redistribute.
[00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:09.791]  The type of shares.
[00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:17.460]  They're going to redistribute social and cultural capital in addition to economic and material capital.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.243]  Well, behaviors are going to have to change, and this is one thing we're asking companies.
[00:46:22.664 --> 00:46:26.968]  You have to force behaviors, and at BlackRock, we are forcing behaviors.
[00:46:27.749 --> 00:46:29.410]  And so this is my thesis.
[00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:30.751]  When we say, what is woke?
[00:46:32.193 --> 00:46:32.433]  Woke?
[00:46:33.502 --> 00:46:36.564]  is Maoism with American characteristics.
[00:46:36.664 --> 00:46:42.968]  If I might borrow from Mao himself, who said that his philosophy was Marxism-Leninism with Chinese characteristics.
[00:46:43.448 --> 00:46:45.789]  Which means, woke is Marxism.
[00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:52.093]  Henry Kissinger contributed to a book with the head of the Kissinger Group, Rothkopf, now about 15 years ago, called Superclass.
[00:46:52.293 --> 00:46:58.497]  They say it's about 3,000 people worldwide that are the main manager class that run it all.
[00:46:58.857 --> 00:47:02.319]  This is a totalitarian, transhumanist death cult.
[00:47:02.759 --> 00:47:08.971]  The biggest question maybe in economics and politics of the coming decades will be what to do.
[00:47:09.676 --> 00:47:11.497]  With all these useless people.
[00:47:11.897 --> 00:47:22.460]  It is an extension of the North American Man-Boy Love Association who think that grown men should be able to have sex with your little boys.
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.501]  That's what's going on here.
[00:47:25.181 --> 00:47:28.122]  These big companies have no right to tell us what to do.
[00:47:28.162 --> 00:47:31.763]  And I think we as legislators need to think about it, who we're representing.
[00:47:32.063 --> 00:47:34.504]  Because these agencies do not represent the people.
[00:47:34.844 --> 00:47:37.225]  They represent big special interest groups.
[00:47:37.265 --> 00:47:38.605]  People rotate between them.
[00:47:38.645 --> 00:47:42.327]  They're getting jobs, and lobbying, and careers, and all of these different companies.
[00:47:42.747 --> 00:47:47.549]  And they are promulgating these rules to benefit large special interest groups.
[00:47:47.669 --> 00:47:52.951]  And now they are becoming so powerful that everyone is afraid to challenge them.
[00:47:53.451 --> 00:48:09.276]  So our branch has to get our act together and start doing our job and not be afraid of administrative state, not be afraid of large corporation and big money that coming from all directions.
[00:48:09.597 --> 00:48:17.639]  But we actually remember that this republic is set up and being the greatest republic in the history of the world for all the reasons.
[00:48:17.659 --> 00:48:19.240]  There is no difference between the people.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.565]  Because the people have the most power and freedoms.
[00:48:23.665 --> 00:48:31.474]  And if we take these freedoms away from the people, we're going to unfortunately abandon and betray all the people who die for our freedoms.
[00:48:31.594 --> 00:48:32.134]  I yield back.
[00:48:32.254 --> 00:48:38.522]  The reason humanity is in so much trouble is because we will not admit to ourselves that true evil exists.
[00:48:39.222 --> 00:48:50.247]  And when methodologies of total evil and corruption are being carried out against us, we will not come to grips with the fact that we are truly facing absolute, pure, total corruption.
[00:48:50.607 --> 00:48:53.789]  The FBI interfered in the 2016 election.
[00:48:54.189 --> 00:49:00.352]  And then when they failed to get their candidate elected, Hillary Clinton, then they just set out to destroy the Trump administration.
[00:49:00.772 --> 00:49:02.653]  So then go back and go up to 2020.
[00:49:02.853 --> 00:49:14.020]  It was the CIA this time that got involved in the 2020 election with those 51 former intel agents who talked about the Hunter Biden laptop is total Russian disinformation.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.361]  So they've gotten away with it for two elections.
[00:49:16.661 --> 00:49:18.243]  They're for sure going to get away with it.
[00:49:18.283 --> 00:49:20.305]  Try to get away with it in 24, right?
[00:49:20.385 --> 00:49:21.706]  Because there's no consequence.
[00:49:22.107 --> 00:49:25.410]  The difference is in 2024, the evidence is there.
[00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:27.152]  We now have the Durham investigation.
[00:49:27.192 --> 00:49:28.773]  We have all the congressional investigations.
[00:49:29.053 --> 00:49:33.117]  There is now hard evidence that there was election interference by the U.S.
[00:49:33.158 --> 00:49:35.400]  intelligence agencies and the Department of Justice.
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.061]  They've got to be terrified.
[00:49:37.121 --> 00:49:49.471]  Those individuals have to be terrified that a Republican president comes in in the 2024 election with a Republican attorney general, investigates them and charges them all with the crimes they've committed over the last eight years.
[00:49:49.891 --> 00:50:01.280]  Then you study the Bible and history and our enemies and they are a consortium of people following what can only be called satanic principles.
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:04.262]  Hey, do you guys support the satanic pride propaganda?
[00:50:05.026 --> 00:50:06.307]  I, I, yeah, both.
[00:50:06.667 --> 00:50:07.207]  You support it?
[00:50:07.667 --> 00:50:08.668]  Satan and pride.
[00:50:08.708 --> 00:50:09.388]  You support Satan?
[00:50:09.408 --> 00:50:09.808]  Mm-hmm.
[00:50:10.788 --> 00:50:11.749]  What's God gonna think of that?
[00:50:11.769 --> 00:50:13.249]  I don't believe in God.
[00:50:13.289 --> 00:50:13.750]  Is that bad?
[00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:15.270]  You're, you guys are satanic.
[00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:16.411]  True.
[00:50:17.431 --> 00:50:24.874]  See, open satanic, that, open satanist, guys, that's what we're gonna get up against, is open satanist, like they're... Alright, so here's the deal.
[00:50:26.535 --> 00:50:37.664]   If you're not totally in, totally bought in, On the radical left ideology and culture, then they put you on a terror watch list.
[00:50:39.045 --> 00:50:43.067]  It's funny that all these leftists out there, they think they're anti-establishment.
[00:50:43.147 --> 00:50:46.708]  No, you are literally the foot soldiers for the establishment.
[00:50:47.088 --> 00:50:50.890]  You are the equivalent of the Nazi Youth Brigade.
[00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:52.211]  The brown shirts.
[00:50:52.331 --> 00:50:53.711]  That's you guys.
[00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:56.312]  It's amazing you haven't figured that out yet.
[00:50:56.412 --> 00:50:57.093]  Or have they?
[00:50:57.113 --> 00:50:59.094]  And they've just embraced the role as the bad guys.
[00:50:59.154 --> 00:51:11.089]   And so now, The federal government's pyramid of far-right radicalization, which is ironic enough, actually at the top of it is socialism.
[00:51:11.369 --> 00:51:13.890]  So since when is socialism a right-wing idea?
[00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:20.172]  I thought that was a left-wing idea with all the Nazi symbolism and all the socialism symbols there.
[00:51:20.713 --> 00:51:25.754]  So it's funny, at the top of the far-right pyramid is actually far-leftism.
[00:51:26.615 --> 00:51:29.436]  Far-left policies like socialism.
[00:51:29.496 --> 00:51:30.616]  So that's ironic.
[00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:36.178]  But they have the InfoWars logo right on there, as well as Breitbart and PragerU and others.
[00:51:37.178 --> 00:51:37.779]  Oh my gosh!
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.622]  Yeah, you're the anti-establishment.
[00:51:42.682 --> 00:51:53.309]  You literally do the bidding of the federal government that has declared war on how many nations, or didn't declare war on how many nations, or ran how many coups in foreign nations.
[00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.630]  You don't even know.
[00:51:55.706 --> 00:52:01.733]  And they get 80 grants and 40 million taxpayer dollars to target conservatives, target right-wingers.
[00:52:03.195 --> 00:52:03.835]  But who is it really?
[00:52:03.996 --> 00:52:05.697]  It really is now the anti-establishment.
[00:52:07.219 --> 00:52:09.041]  Coined right here by Infowars.
[00:52:09.081 --> 00:52:11.524]  Conservatism is counter-culture.
[00:52:11.544 --> 00:52:13.646]  Well, that's why they're coming after all the conservatives now.
[00:52:16.149 --> 00:52:19.913]  But the culture wars are truly on.
[00:52:20.453 --> 00:52:27.580]  Iowa governor signs bills restricting sex books, teaching gender identity and sexual orientation in elementary schools.
[00:52:28.521 --> 00:52:39.151]  It's sad that you even have to do that, but you've seen the literature, you've seen the propaganda aimed at children that they're bringing into the classrooms now, so you do have to do that.
[00:52:40.057 --> 00:52:47.060]  Governor Kristi Noem calls for College Board to prohibit drag shows and remove references to preferred pronouns.
[00:52:50.942 --> 00:52:53.223]  Well, you know, calling for the College Board to do that doesn't do much.
[00:52:53.283 --> 00:52:54.063]  I doubt they will.
[00:52:55.544 --> 00:52:57.585]  I think the Iowa Governor's move is the right one.
[00:52:58.325 --> 00:52:58.785]  Ban it.
[00:52:59.766 --> 00:53:02.407]  I would say just ban it everything from high school down.
[00:53:03.447 --> 00:53:04.748]  Maybe don't even mess with the colleges.
[00:53:04.968 --> 00:53:06.309]  Ban it everything high school down.
[00:53:06.709 --> 00:53:08.510]  Unless the whole pronoun thing, I mean, that's just...
[00:53:09.468 --> 00:53:10.411]  That's a whole nother issue.
[00:53:10.431 --> 00:53:11.614]  They're just rewriting language.
[00:53:13.278 --> 00:53:15.965]  So, I mean, I guess if you want that in your higher education, good luck.
[00:53:18.402 --> 00:53:20.483]  Higher education is now lower indoctrination.
[00:53:21.283 --> 00:53:31.208]  Woke Twilight actress with non-binary child gets blasted after calling target boycotters terrorists and whining over store removing LGBT products.
[00:53:31.928 --> 00:53:38.531]  And, you know, it's actually sad because you have this infighting inside the Republican Party, which I've expressed before.
[00:53:38.791 --> 00:53:40.292]  Don't get too concerned about it.
[00:53:40.312 --> 00:53:43.733]  This is probably going to be a healthy process, all things considered, once we get to 2024.
[00:53:43.773 --> 00:53:51.659]   But, You're sitting here watching this conservative infighting, Republican infighting, Trump DeSantis.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:55.881]  Is it good that people go into Target and film or smash up Pride signs?
[00:53:56.361 --> 00:54:07.907]  And it's just funny to me, it's just funny to me that we'd rather sit here and scratch and claw at ourselves instead of dealing with the real issues, like the fact that they're targeting your children for sex.
[00:54:09.301 --> 00:54:17.267]  Like the fact that the Democrats run massive ballot harvesting initiatives that allow them to win the major states and win presidential elections.
[00:54:18.868 --> 00:54:20.389]  That's what our focus should be.
[00:54:20.669 --> 00:54:21.790]  But how ironic is it?
[00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:28.831]  They say conservatives that boycott Target are terrorists.
[00:54:29.671 --> 00:54:33.333]  How many... Look, this thing went totally viral over the weekend.
[00:54:34.434 --> 00:54:43.919]  The sarcasm of showing all the clips of Target getting burned to the ground and looted and everything else during the BLM, George Floyd, Antifa riots of 2020, the summer of 2020, the summer of rage.
[00:54:43.939 --> 00:54:44.599]  175 Target stores shut down.
[00:54:44.419 --> 00:54:51.419]   of rage, 175 Target stores shut down. That's literal terrorism. That is literally left-wing
[00:54:51.419 --> 00:54:56.098]  terrorism.
[00:54:56.023 --> 00:54:59.424]  Literally the definition of leftist terrorism.
[00:54:59.944 --> 00:55:00.784]  And that's what they did.
[00:55:02.624 --> 00:55:05.225]  You boycotted a target, they call that terrorism.
[00:55:05.665 --> 00:55:09.486]  You burn down and loot a target, they call that a peaceful protest.
[00:55:12.246 --> 00:55:13.646]  Maybe that's a little too extended.
[00:55:13.826 --> 00:55:16.787]  Why don't we narrow the purview?
[00:55:18.184 --> 00:55:26.471]  Utah Target evacuated after it received a bomb threat for turning its back on the LGBT community.
[00:55:27.732 --> 00:55:30.774]  Oh, is that conservative terrorism again?
[00:55:30.954 --> 00:55:33.316]  No, that's leftist terrorism again.
[00:55:33.957 --> 00:55:41.783]  A Target in Layton, Utah was evacuated after bomb threats were made against the store and several others in Utah and Ohio.
[00:55:42.684 --> 00:55:43.685]  Two local news stations.
[00:55:43.965 --> 00:55:44.906]  So radical left-winger.
[00:55:45.779 --> 00:55:46.500]  The real terrorists.
[00:55:47.461 --> 00:55:52.066]  Police said the threats were made from a, quote, bonus email address.
[00:55:52.727 --> 00:55:59.574]  A local Ohio newspaper also received an email threatening five stores, claiming, we will continue to bomb your targets until you stop cowering.
[00:56:00.335 --> 00:56:00.735]  Hmm.
[00:56:01.857 --> 00:56:02.157]  Hmm.
[00:56:02.337 --> 00:56:03.338]  Who are the real terrorists?
[00:56:04.554 --> 00:56:05.614]  Threatening to bomb targets.
[00:56:06.394 --> 00:56:09.435]  Actually did, with their violence, shut down 175 targets.
[00:56:09.495 --> 00:56:11.735]  Oh yeah, those were liberal Democrat progressives.
[00:56:11.935 --> 00:56:12.796]  That's who they were.
[00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:13.956]  Those are the real ones.
[00:56:14.576 --> 00:56:15.216]  Every.
[00:56:15.716 --> 00:56:16.376]  Single.
[00:56:16.736 --> 00:56:17.337]  Time.
[00:56:18.357 --> 00:56:18.757]  Every.
[00:56:18.957 --> 00:56:19.297]  Single.
[00:56:19.357 --> 00:56:19.637]  Time.
[00:56:19.977 --> 00:56:25.218]  But yeah, you stepped foot on the wrong blade of grass on the wrong day in the wrong town, you might go to jail for 18 years.
[00:56:25.678 --> 00:56:28.919]  Climate activists arrested on federal conspiracy charges.
[00:56:29.699 --> 00:56:32.380]  For damaging Degas display at DC Museum.
[00:56:32.801 --> 00:56:45.086]  So chalk that one up to another far-left terrorist desecrating venerable objects, destroying historical archives, destroying acts, or rather, works of art.
[00:56:46.747 --> 00:56:50.469]  Timeless works of art across the entire planet, not just here in the US.
[00:56:50.489 --> 00:56:51.709]  That's the left.
[00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:55.531]  They also like to superglue themselves to highways.
[00:56:56.532 --> 00:56:56.732]  Yes.
[00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:03.975]  I think we should leave them there when they do it, and I think we should leave them as part of the display, too.
[00:57:04.616 --> 00:57:06.238]  That would be my new tactic, because you know...
[00:57:08.404 --> 00:57:17.888]  When you're dealing with children, when you're dealing with immature individuals, children, you know you've got to find creative ways to discipline them to get them to learn, right?
[00:57:18.788 --> 00:57:25.051]  Sometimes the standard protocols or the normal approaches towards discipline don't work with all children.
[00:57:25.411 --> 00:57:26.712]  So you have to find new approaches.
[00:57:26.732 --> 00:57:31.674]  And that's what we're going to have to do with these climate activists that keep destroying property and art.
[00:57:33.471 --> 00:57:35.032]  And glue themselves to the streets.
[00:57:35.052 --> 00:57:36.852]  We're going to have to change the way we discipline them.
[00:57:37.953 --> 00:57:42.074]  No longer arresting them and throwing them in jail for a night or whatever is good enough.
[00:57:42.214 --> 00:57:52.338]  No, what needs to be done now, the new disciplinary action to work with these immature children, climate terrorists, is you need to make them a permanent part of the exhibit.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.121]  That's what you should do.
[00:57:54.901 --> 00:58:04.567]  So, when they superglue themselves to the streets or the city sidewalks or wherever, just take a couple cones out there, put the cones around them and say, okay, you get your protest now.
[00:58:05.228 --> 00:58:05.608]  Good luck.
[00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:10.131]  We'll see how that goes.
[00:58:11.052 --> 00:58:30.742]   We'll see how long they like being superglued to the streets before they rip their own skin off, and we'll see how much the Other members of society enjoy having a lunatic that superglued himself to the street be sitting there crying about climate change.
[00:58:31.583 --> 00:58:34.126]  Let's see how that works.
[00:58:34.846 --> 00:58:38.591]  My guess is that will deter that type of activity.
[00:58:38.971 --> 00:58:41.194]  Same thing when they destroy the art exhibits here.
[00:58:43.098 --> 00:58:43.739]  Detain them?
[00:58:43.779 --> 00:58:44.520]  I wouldn't remove them?
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:47.023]  I would make them a permanent part of the exhibit.
[00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:52.170]  I would seriously handcuff them to the exhibit.
[00:58:53.157 --> 00:58:59.942]  Now there actually might be a way to do this, depending on local jurisdictions and what their laws are, let's say.
[00:59:00.363 --> 00:59:04.946]  You might be able to detain people in public for quote-unquote 24 hours, detain them in public if you view them as a threat.
[00:59:05.226 --> 00:59:06.007]  So I'm serious.
[00:59:06.127 --> 00:59:13.552]  If they superglue themselves to a work of art or a display, let them sit there for 24 hours.
[00:59:13.653 --> 00:59:14.833]  Let's let the world see.
[00:59:15.134 --> 00:59:16.815]  This is now part of the art exhibit.
[00:59:17.095 --> 00:59:20.378]  A deranged climate terrorist that wanted to destroy this and ruin your day.
[00:59:20.778 --> 00:59:21.819]  Now part of the exhibit.
[00:59:24.392 --> 00:59:35.738]  Here, speaking of an exhibit, revealed disgraced former Biden official Sam Brinton, yes, that Sam Brinton, was member of a drag nun group that is now promoted by the L.A.
[00:59:35.778 --> 00:59:36.238]  Dodgers.
[00:59:36.518 --> 00:59:42.301]  So the kleptomaniac who likes to wear other people's skin but can't so he wears their clothing after he steals it.
[00:59:42.601 --> 00:59:44.082]  He was also a drag nun!
[00:59:44.542 --> 00:59:45.843]  He's into puppy kink play.
[00:59:46.443 --> 00:59:50.025]  He was, you know, Biden's official with the Nuclear Waste Department.
[00:59:51.446 --> 00:59:51.586]  Yeah.
[00:59:53.712 --> 00:59:55.513]  All right, let's take a look at some of the political news here.
[00:59:58.895 --> 01:00:00.436]  This is a growing phenomenon.
[01:00:00.456 --> 01:00:06.040]  It also ties into the whole BRICS success story.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.842]  China rejecting contact with U.S.
[01:00:08.882 --> 01:00:10.383]  military according to the Pentagon.
[01:00:10.403 --> 01:00:16.086]  So is this because China's recent relations with Russia?
[01:00:16.247 --> 01:00:20.970]  Is this because China is so sick and tired of the Biden administration?
[01:00:22.409 --> 01:00:23.630]  Is something else going on?
[01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:25.672]  Is it a combination of that and other things?
[01:00:27.093 --> 01:00:33.258]  It's pretty significant though, considering the current geopolitical strife going on.
[01:00:35.103 --> 01:00:38.366]  And they don't want to make a big deal of this because it's embarrassing, folks.
[01:00:38.406 --> 01:00:43.329]  This is an embarrassment to the Biden administration that China won't even pick up their phone calls.
[01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:46.291]  So just add it to the list of countries that won't pick up Biden's phone calls.
[01:00:46.672 --> 01:00:48.193]  Nobody respects this administration.
[01:00:48.273 --> 01:00:49.874]  Everybody knows they're a bunch of crooks and liars.
[01:00:50.995 --> 01:00:53.456]  So the debt ceiling has been a major topic.
[01:00:53.497 --> 01:00:55.218]  It looks like McCarthy took the L here.
[01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:58.051]  Debt ceiling deal.
[01:00:58.111 --> 01:00:58.791]  What's in?
[01:00:58.891 --> 01:01:01.213]  What's out of the agreement to avert U.S.
[01:01:01.233 --> 01:01:01.673]  default?
[01:01:01.713 --> 01:01:02.894]  Well, we really don't know everything yet.
[01:01:03.314 --> 01:01:07.237]  Here are some of the reported details of the debt limit agreement between Biden and McCarthy.
[01:01:08.017 --> 01:01:13.057]   Rand Paul doesn't like it. This deal is insanity. Conservatives blast McCarthy's debt ceiling deal
[01:01:13.057 --> 01:01:18.177]   with Biden. House lawmakers furious over deal raising debt ceiling by four trillion dollars
[01:01:18.177 --> 01:01:23.456]   with no cap on spending for two more years, maintaining Democrats wish list and keeping
[01:01:23.456 --> 01:01:29.617]   in place the IRS expansion by 98 percent. Fake conservatives agree to fake spending cuts.
[01:01:29.758 --> 01:01:31.103]  Mock Senator Rand Paul.
[01:01:32.625 --> 01:01:41.111]  Conservative House Republicans are sounding the alarm over Speaker Kevin McCarthy's debt ceiling deal with the Biden regime, which was just announced last night.
[01:01:42.212 --> 01:01:49.216]  Yet, McCarthy has been taking victory laps since the deal was announced, calling it a step in the right direction, in part because it doesn't raise taxes.
[01:01:49.236 --> 01:01:50.177]  Well, it should have cut taxes.
[01:01:50.557 --> 01:01:51.858]  Property taxes should be illegal.
[01:01:51.898 --> 01:01:52.279]  It's theft.
[01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:57.742]  So McCarthy took the L. He's going to try to take the W, pretend like he took the W. He took the L.
[01:01:58.923 --> 01:01:59.964]  Bad news for Americans.
[01:01:59.984 --> 01:02:09.250]  98% of 87,000 new IRS agents are here to stay after McCarthy caves into Democrats.
[01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:14.433]  So they're going to be the ones coming to your front door with guns, saying you didn't pay the government enough money.
[01:02:14.613 --> 01:02:15.774]  You didn't pay the mafia.
[01:02:16.054 --> 01:02:19.176]  You didn't give the mafia their cut.
[01:02:19.417 --> 01:02:21.298]  So now they're coming to your front door.
[01:02:22.324 --> 01:02:26.567]  And it's going to be people that get paid on Cash App and Venmo.
[01:02:26.927 --> 01:02:30.910]  It's going to be people that make money in tips, waitresses, bartenders.
[01:02:31.211 --> 01:02:32.392]  They're going to be coming for you first.
[01:02:32.672 --> 01:02:38.376]  They're going to be coming for content creators on the Internet that they know make a lot of money but don't file for taxes.
[01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:43.420]  And of course, they're going to be coming after Christians and Catholics and conservatives as well.
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:51.145]  This is a new weapon of the Biden administration, a new weapon of the American authoritarian left to come after its political opposition.
[01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:57.157]  So we'll see what happens with that story as it develops this week.
[01:02:57.257 --> 01:03:01.483]  But yes, I would guess that McCarthy took a big fat L on this deal.
[01:03:02.164 --> 01:03:04.186]  And he can take as many victory laps as he wants.
[01:03:04.827 --> 01:03:06.169]  I don't think it's going to work.
[01:03:06.229 --> 01:03:08.432]  Now, what's going on in Texas is a concern.
[01:03:09.113 --> 01:03:21.502]  Ken Paxton, one of the great Attorney Generals in this country, is under attack from the swamp from the left and sadly the right here in Texas.
[01:03:21.562 --> 01:03:25.145]  The Republican Party has turned their back on him, the Texas voters.
[01:03:25.625 --> 01:03:26.966]  It's a sad state of affairs.
[01:03:27.446 --> 01:03:31.990]  Texas lawmakers issued 20 articles of impeachment against State Attorney General Ken Paxton.
[01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:33.190]  Now there's a bunch of stuff on this.
[01:03:34.851 --> 01:03:39.313]  Here is one individual involved in that process breaking it down in clip 11.
[01:03:42.494 --> 01:03:52.577]  It was filled with falsehoods and misrepresentations and they have never reached out to our office to determine whether anything that was contained in that testimony yesterday was remotely true.
[01:03:55.238 --> 01:03:57.519]  The process here has been completely lacking.
[01:03:58.744 --> 01:04:03.267]  They deserve to hear, the people deserve to hear, from this office in the context of this investigation.
[01:04:04.168 --> 01:04:06.610]  Furthermore, this is an illegal investigation.
[01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:12.474]  Any discussion of impeachment is completely foreclosed by Texas law.
[01:04:13.134 --> 01:04:23.281]  Texas government code 665.081 says clearly that any proposed impeachment can only be about conduct since the most recent election.
[01:04:23.741 --> 01:04:24.662]  The voters have spoken.
[01:04:24.702 --> 01:04:25.903]  They want Ken Paxton.
[01:04:27.091 --> 01:04:28.152]  The voters want Ken Paxton.
[01:04:28.592 --> 01:04:39.639]   And this committee, by investigating him, by not allowing us to be heard here today, by never reaching out to us at any time during this investigative process, Is trying to thwart the will of the voters.
[01:04:40.059 --> 01:04:41.340]  We deserve to be heard here today.
[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:44.102]  They should let me register to testify as a resource witness.
[01:04:44.402 --> 01:04:50.907]  They should have asked our office about any of the facts that they heard yesterday, which by the way, have been reported for years.
[01:04:51.607 --> 01:04:51.967]  For years.
[01:04:52.788 --> 01:04:59.013]  The 2022 election, the primary and the general was run on these issues, these allegations.
[01:04:59.353 --> 01:05:00.374]  The voters have spoken.
[01:05:01.154 --> 01:05:02.935]  They want Ken Paxman as their attorney general.
[01:05:03.476 --> 01:05:04.697]  This committee should hear from us today.
[01:05:05.222 --> 01:05:07.045]  Do you think the committee is having these proceedings?
[01:05:07.105 --> 01:05:11.431]  Excuse me, this room is being used for a committee hearing and we're not able to be taking anything.
[01:05:11.471 --> 01:05:13.494]  So if y'all want to continue, you're welcome to move out.
[01:05:13.554 --> 01:05:16.878]  But right now, the room is being used for a formal meeting.
[01:05:17.139 --> 01:05:18.100]  Yeah, get out of the room.
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:19.762]  They always hate it when the truth gets spoken.
[01:05:20.323 --> 01:05:21.885]  Trump calls out Governor Abbott.
[01:05:22.813 --> 01:05:34.541]  For being missing in action on RINO impeachment of Attorney General Ken Paxson and it just shows how out of touch the Republican Party is that they're not supporting Ken Paxson with as much might as possible.
[01:05:34.942 --> 01:05:35.982]  Trump gets it.
[01:05:36.603 --> 01:05:38.064]  Abbott, not so much.
[01:05:38.084 --> 01:05:43.608]  It's really a shame and Ken Paxson is continuing to get stuff done even though they've now suspended him.
[01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:48.003]  The health and safety of the people of Texas will always be my number one priority.
[01:05:48.363 --> 01:05:52.686]  Pharmaceutical companies are being held responsible for the damage caused by the opioid epidemic.
[01:05:52.986 --> 01:05:58.750]  Walgreens will help prevent this tragic epidemic from taking more lives in the future and it will also provide treatment for those still struggling.
[01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:08.876]   Said Ken Paxson after he secured a $340 million for Texas in the opioid settlement against Walgreens.
[01:06:09.156 --> 01:06:10.477]  Oh, he's taking down Big Pharma?
[01:06:10.517 --> 01:06:12.138]  I guess now we know why they gotta take him out.
[01:06:12.438 --> 01:06:15.499]  And all the Republicans in on it, too, because they probably get big pharmaceutical money.
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:21.503]  Now, Paxson issued this statement in response to the illegal impeachment.
[01:06:23.188 --> 01:06:29.673]  The ugly spectacle in the Texas House today confirmed the outrageous impeachment plot against me was never meant to be fair or just.
[01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:32.415]  It was a politically motivated sham from the beginning.
[01:06:32.735 --> 01:06:44.003]  My office made every effort to present evidence, testimony, and irrefutable facts that would have disproven the countless false statements and outright lies advanced by Speaker Dade Phelan, the one that's drunk at the podium.
[01:06:45.177 --> 01:06:45.757]  Allegedly.
[01:06:46.538 --> 01:06:49.359]  And the Murr-Johnson panel he appointed.
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.502]  Unfortunately, they refused to consider anything that would interfere with their desired result.
[01:06:54.656 --> 01:06:59.018]  They disregarded the law, ignored the facts, and demonstrated contempt for Texas voters.
[01:06:59.859 --> 01:07:07.723]  Texas voters know that Speaker Phelan and the corrupt politicians he controls are more focused on political retribution against conservatives than the welfare of the people.
[01:07:08.123 --> 01:07:19.709]  Instead of passing critical legislation that would strengthen our border, protect our elections, or stop the Chinese Communist Party from buying up Texas land, they chose to spend the final days of the legislative session smearing me.
[01:07:20.749 --> 01:07:39.525]  Felon's coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans is now in lockstep with the Biden administration, the abortion industry, anti-gun zealots, and woke corporations to sabotage my work as Attorney General, including our ongoing litigation to stop illegal immigration, uphold the rule of law, and protect the constitutional rights of every Texan.
[01:07:40.706 --> 01:07:46.351]  But the people of Texas know that I have always had their back and in return they have always had mine.
[01:07:47.231 --> 01:07:57.840]  What we witness today is not just about me, it's about the corrupt establishment's eagerness to overpower the millions of Texas voters who already made their voices heard when they overwhelmingly re-elected me.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:05.826]  I'm beyond grateful to have the support of millions of Texans who recognize that what we just witnessed is illegal, unethical, and profoundly unjust.
[01:08:06.206 --> 01:08:09.249]  I look forward to a quick resolution in the Texas Senate.
[01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:13.012]  While I have full confidence the process will be fair and just.
[01:08:13.112 --> 01:08:17.716]  So, this is what the radical left does, folks, throughout human history.
[01:08:17.756 --> 01:08:26.503]  When they get controls over all the levers of power, they use them to their fullest extent against their political opposition.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:32.402]  And the latest example is what they're doing to the great Attorney General, Ken Paxton.

[01:09:12.888 --> 01:09:17.472]   When it comes to retaining and regaining energy, Convenience is key.
[01:09:18.032 --> 01:09:25.554]  Sure, coffee, candy, and other highly sugar-filled products can give you a short boost, but the crash is always the downside.

[01:10:22.172 --> 01:10:25.731]  goes into the Turbo Force Plus formula.

[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:38.750]  There's a reason why we open up the phone lines and so many people call in ranting and raving about how much they love TurboForce, specifically truck drivers, pilots.

[01:10:48.979 --> 01:10:52.183]  Alright, I've got another stack of news I'm going to get to here.
[01:10:52.224 --> 01:10:55.408]  Harrison Smith will be hosting InfoWars Sunday Night Live tonight.
[01:10:55.788 --> 01:11:01.196]  He plans on taking calls, so I'm going to loosen up the phone lines for him, and we'll go ahead and open them up now.
[01:11:01.016 --> 01:11:13.256]   877-789-2539. 877-789-2539. And don't worry if you don't get in with me, Harrison, we'll
[01:11:13.256 --> 01:11:16.216]  have plenty of time to get your call as well.
[01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:24.580]  Quick programming note, we will be live tomorrow, the Alex Jones Show will be live tomorrow with Alex Jones and yours truly.
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.361]  So be tuned in for that.
[01:11:27.421 --> 01:11:30.523]  The other shows will be airing some other special reports.
[01:11:31.003 --> 01:11:33.484]  But the Alex Jones Show will be live on Memorial Day.
[01:11:33.624 --> 01:11:40.108]  If you want to spend our Memorial Day with us, we will be live with Alex Jones.
[01:11:40.188 --> 01:11:41.849]  But phone lines open now, 877-789-2539.
[01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:48.232]  In the meantime, let's hit the rest of this news.
[01:11:48.292 --> 01:11:53.295]  Microsoft boss reveals his biggest AI fear and stark warning over dangerous tech.
[01:11:55.149 --> 01:11:58.792]  And so this is kind of a story that hasn't really been big.
[01:11:58.832 --> 01:12:08.078]  It's starting to kind of pick up, and I've constantly stressed it's something we're not talking about enough, especially now that the FDA has approved Neuralink.
[01:12:08.478 --> 01:12:09.859]  Now it really gets dangerous.
[01:12:09.919 --> 01:12:15.583]  I mean, one thing you worry about AI maybe taking over our digital grid, maybe you can just shut it off somehow.
[01:12:15.963 --> 01:12:19.786]  It gets into our biology somehow with this Neuralink crap?
[01:12:19.946 --> 01:12:21.127]  We got a whole other issue, folks.
[01:12:22.879 --> 01:12:28.982]  And it's funny because people are starting to realize what the elites are doing to maintain their youth.
[01:12:30.603 --> 01:12:34.965]  And if you want to know where they get these ingredients, well, that's one question.
[01:12:35.025 --> 01:12:43.270]  But we know, because some of them tell you, this tech mogul takes his son's blood in order to stay young and healthy.
[01:12:44.751 --> 01:12:49.733]  Brian Johnson may look like a middle-aged man, but inside his veins pumps the blood of a 17-year-old.
[01:12:52.185 --> 01:13:05.693]  And so this is just kind of the introduction surface level of the adrenochrome blood serums that the elite use to stay young.
[01:13:05.733 --> 01:13:14.298]  And there's a reason why you see all that representation, that symbology in films, I mean even in Disney films.
[01:13:15.549 --> 01:13:18.512]  Films dating back long decades ago.
[01:13:19.172 --> 01:13:26.278]  It's a known thing using human blood to stay young.
[01:13:26.338 --> 01:13:29.041]  And sometimes now they just go on TV and brag about it.
[01:13:30.422 --> 01:13:36.047]  They just go on TV and brag about how they use the blood of the youth as skin serums and everything else.
[01:13:36.587 --> 01:13:38.369]  Yeah, one example might be the Dark Crystal.
[01:13:40.205 --> 01:13:48.029]  But it's one thing, as twisted as it might be, for a man to use his child's blood to stay young.
[01:13:48.850 --> 01:13:51.071]  We're talking about kidnapped children.
[01:13:51.531 --> 01:13:53.852]  We're talking about what are they doing at Epstein Island.
[01:13:54.232 --> 01:13:59.615]  We're talking about the adrenochrome produced by the youth, like some believe Monsters, Inc.
[01:13:59.775 --> 01:14:00.756]  is an analogy for.
[01:14:03.217 --> 01:14:06.659]  That is the dark side of this.
[01:14:09.284 --> 01:14:13.107]  Meanwhile, in every Democrat city, violent crime is getting worse and worse.
[01:14:14.228 --> 01:14:19.133]  One dead after shooting on DC Metro, less than a quarter mile from Nationals Park.
[01:14:19.273 --> 01:14:22.877]  This trend continues where the Washington Nationals play baseball.
[01:14:23.217 --> 01:14:25.099]  Violent crime happens right down the street.
[01:14:25.139 --> 01:14:27.241]  Sometimes you can hear gunshots during the games.
[01:14:27.741 --> 01:14:28.702]  It's a gun-free zone.
[01:14:29.643 --> 01:14:34.747]  Suspect who fatally shoved man onto Minneapolis light rail released without charges.
[01:14:34.927 --> 01:14:35.428]  That's good.
[01:14:35.448 --> 01:14:36.769]  He'll be right back out on the streets.
[01:14:36.789 --> 01:14:39.611]  He'll shove someone else to their death and it'll all be fine.
[01:14:39.931 --> 01:14:45.175]  San Francisco mayor's speech on crime interrupted by activists doing a violent crime.
[01:14:45.735 --> 01:14:50.159]  They can't even... Can you just... Can you not do crime while I'm speaking about stopping crime?
[01:14:50.279 --> 01:14:50.599]  Please?
[01:14:50.639 --> 01:14:51.260]  Just one time?
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:52.381]  No.
[01:14:52.801 --> 01:14:57.484]  Seattle struggles to hire more police officers as 9-11 response times increase.
[01:14:57.564 --> 01:14:57.865]  Well, gee.
[01:15:00.202 --> 01:15:01.983]  Who would want to be a police officer these days?
[01:15:03.203 --> 01:15:25.931]  When you know the media hates you, the Democrat Party hates you, the city you're in is probably run by Democrats that hate you, and they put a target on your back for an ambush, for a violent crime to be committed against you, but then if you actually try to do your job and something goes wrong, you're going to jail, you're going to be destroyed the rest of your life.
[01:15:27.111 --> 01:15:29.392]  So am I surprised people don't want to be police officers anymore?
[01:15:30.206 --> 01:15:30.386]  No.
[01:15:32.046 --> 01:15:32.207]  No.
[01:15:33.627 --> 01:15:34.967]  Democrats got it all figured out, though.
[01:15:34.987 --> 01:15:36.268]  You can see how well it's going in their cities.
[01:15:37.608 --> 01:15:39.328]  Like, or California, their states.
[01:15:39.928 --> 01:15:48.030]  State Farm will no longer accept new applications for California property insurance due to wildfires, inflation, and historic construction costs.
[01:15:48.090 --> 01:15:49.031]  They're just leaving.
[01:15:49.131 --> 01:15:49.991]  They're just done.
[01:15:51.101 --> 01:15:54.950]  Many brick-and-mortar stores just leaving, just done with California.
[01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:58.036]  Can't keep up with the cost to operate there, the taxes.
[01:15:58.417 --> 01:16:00.762]  Can't keep up with the amount of theft that goes on.
[01:16:03.069 --> 01:16:03.750]  That's what commies do.
[01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:05.851]  They shut you down.
[01:16:06.152 --> 01:16:12.337]  Another San Francisco retailer closes Old Navy to shut down flagship location after almost 30 years.
[01:16:12.937 --> 01:16:14.238]  Shut it down.
[01:16:14.879 --> 01:16:16.460]  That should be the real Democrat slogan.
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:17.841]  Shut it down.
[01:16:18.542 --> 01:16:19.943]  That's a nice business you have there.
[01:16:20.063 --> 01:16:21.364]  Shut it down.
[01:16:22.165 --> 01:16:23.506]  That's a nice city you have there.
[01:16:23.606 --> 01:16:24.987]  Shut it down.
[01:16:27.509 --> 01:16:28.890]  That's a nice school you have there.
[01:16:29.211 --> 01:16:31.793]  Shut it down and let the illegal immigrants take it.
[01:16:32.697 --> 01:16:37.650]  Lululemon employees say they were fired for calling 911 on looters ransacking store.
[01:16:38.231 --> 01:16:39.374]  And there's a video of this!
[01:16:41.559 --> 01:16:51.282]  And the person is filming as it's about three or four young gentlemen, you know, the scholarly type, are robbing this Lululemon for thousands of dollars in merchandise.
[01:16:51.642 --> 01:16:53.422]  And so the workers are just filming it.
[01:16:54.342 --> 01:16:56.743]  They don't even get confrontational physically.
[01:16:56.783 --> 01:16:59.684]  They're just filming it and then call the police and they get fired.
[01:17:00.144 --> 01:17:02.184]  And then Lululemon releases a statement.
[01:17:02.524 --> 01:17:04.165]  This is the most batty part of it all.
[01:17:06.109 --> 01:17:13.435]  So they get fired, Lululemon issues a statement in response to firing the employees that tried to stop crime, theft, in their store.
[01:17:13.995 --> 01:17:19.540]  And Lululemon's statement is, we have policies to keep our stores safe.
[01:17:20.901 --> 01:17:21.161]  What?
[01:17:21.742 --> 01:17:26.926]  So allowing criminals to run rampant in your store, that's the policy to keep it safe?
[01:17:29.208 --> 01:17:32.430]  Let me guess, you probably got a gun-free zone in front of the storefront as well.
[01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:35.664]   That's how you keep your Employees safe?
[01:17:35.724 --> 01:17:37.285]  That's how you keep your customers safe?
[01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:41.467]  By saying, we let criminals come in here and steal stuff?
[01:17:41.527 --> 01:17:43.628]  And by the way, you can't have a gun to protect yourself?
[01:17:43.988 --> 01:17:46.929]  And Lululemon says, this is how we keep our customers and staff safe.
[01:17:47.730 --> 01:17:48.490]  Lululemon!
[01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:51.912]  They should just give that whole company over to criminals at this point.
[01:17:51.952 --> 01:17:53.852]  I mean, come on, that'll be the safe option.
[01:17:56.474 --> 01:18:00.435]  When I was in school, that's okay, look, she's allowed to do anything you want.
[01:18:02.536 --> 01:18:04.217]  Kids rule in my house, okay?
[01:18:05.984 --> 01:18:08.026]  What's the matter?
[01:18:08.106 --> 01:18:08.887]  What's the matter?
[01:18:10.308 --> 01:18:11.089]  I don't blame you.
[01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:12.310]  I'm bored with me too.
[01:18:15.212 --> 01:18:16.454]  Boy, a lot to unpack here.
[01:18:16.474 --> 01:18:18.676]  A lot to unpack there.
[01:18:18.736 --> 01:18:20.097]  Biden at the White House over the weekend.
[01:18:20.417 --> 01:18:25.061]  What is the story there that he just can't stop with the children and that deal?
[01:18:25.976 --> 01:18:29.539]  Or that he basically admits that his entire presidency is a sham.
[01:18:29.579 --> 01:18:30.520]  He's bored with it, too.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.481]  He doesn't even want to be there.
[01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:34.303]  Joe Biden admits he doesn't even want to be president.
[01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:36.265]  Joe Biden admits he doesn't even want to be in the White House.
[01:18:36.605 --> 01:18:40.548]  Or is it Joe Biden can't stop going after children that go into the White House?
[01:18:41.769 --> 01:18:43.769]  What is going on at the FBI?
[01:18:43.769 --> 01:18:45.769]  Um...
[01:18:45.769 --> 01:18:49.769]   *sigh* I mean, I, you know...
[01:18:49.769 --> 01:18:59.769]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:18:52.378 --> 01:18:52.618]  Folks.
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:56.541]  The stuff from Hunter Biden's laptop is basically all public now.
[01:18:58.062 --> 01:18:58.362]  Okay.
[01:19:01.844 --> 01:19:02.844]  It's disgusting.
[01:19:03.944 --> 01:19:04.705]  It's disgusting.
[01:19:05.605 --> 01:19:09.787]  You know, and it'd be one thing, unfortunately I have to stumble upon this every once in a while.
[01:19:11.248 --> 01:19:20.752]  You know, it's one thing when I see the Hunter Biden porn videos with adults, and it's him with adults doing stuff.
[01:19:22.056 --> 01:19:28.281]  It's another thing when you see Hunter Biden with what appears to be minors doing God knows what.
[01:19:29.502 --> 01:19:30.823]  I'm sure it's all family friendly, though.
[01:19:31.843 --> 01:19:36.667]  But it's all out there and it's just like, OK, well, I guess just totally normal.
[01:19:38.408 --> 01:19:44.253]  But then you see this and you just scratch your head and you wonder, oh, is this what the Patriot Front is really all about?
[01:19:45.885 --> 01:19:51.293]  Because this is a new Democrat propaganda account, and you say, well, how do you know it's a Democrat propaganda account?
[01:19:51.333 --> 01:19:53.216]  Because, folks, these accounts come out of nowhere.
[01:19:53.637 --> 01:19:59.626]  They get 100,000 followers overnight, and then they end up on your newsfeed every day, and you don't even follow them.
[01:20:00.876 --> 01:20:02.577]  Alejandra Caraballo is the latest.
[01:20:03.118 --> 01:20:04.079]  She shares this story.
[01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:08.442]  Patriot Front member pleads guilty to child pornography charges in Utah.
[01:20:08.622 --> 01:20:10.664]  Oh, every single time it's conservatives.
[01:20:10.784 --> 01:20:14.046]  Every single time it's the people going after the LGBTQ.
[01:20:14.086 --> 01:20:14.627]  It's them.
[01:20:14.687 --> 01:20:15.327]  They're the ones.
[01:20:15.748 --> 01:20:16.688]  This is projection.
[01:20:16.728 --> 01:20:17.789]  This is propaganda.
[01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:21.232]  And what is the real story with the Patriot Front?
[01:20:21.312 --> 01:20:22.553]  Nobody seems to know.
[01:20:24.995 --> 01:20:25.795]  Are they feds?
[01:20:26.236 --> 01:20:28.878]  Did a fed from the Patriot Front get caught with child pornography?
[01:20:30.086 --> 01:20:40.090]  Was this all just a false flag and run this patriot front group out there and then claim they're all pedophiles to project onto the right wing what the LGBTQ plus movement has really become?
[01:20:42.771 --> 01:20:46.433]  Are we even allowed to ask these questions anymore?
[01:20:48.033 --> 01:20:50.994]  Now boys, men, I've got bad news for you here.
[01:20:51.375 --> 01:20:52.535]  We were all concerned.
[01:20:52.575 --> 01:20:53.515]  We all saw it.
[01:20:54.436 --> 01:20:55.376]  Well, maybe not everybody.
[01:20:55.456 --> 01:20:56.617]  Maybe I shouldn't even tell you this.
[01:20:58.077 --> 01:20:59.018]  I don't even want to tell you this.
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:01.221]  But CNN told me this.
[01:21:03.043 --> 01:21:07.868]  What to know about body dysmorphia, the condition affecting Megan Fox?
[01:21:11.653 --> 01:21:11.873]  Wait.
[01:21:12.413 --> 01:21:13.595]  The rumors weren't true!
[01:21:14.736 --> 01:21:15.276]  Couldn't be!
[01:21:15.296 --> 01:21:16.438]  I'm gonna- I can't.
[01:21:17.776 --> 01:21:19.818]  All right, let's go to some phone calls here.
[01:21:19.838 --> 01:21:22.400]  Let's loosen up the phone lines for Harrison Smith.
[01:21:22.441 --> 01:21:27.345]  He's coming in here hosting Sunday Night Live, the host of the American Journal right here at Band.Video.
[01:21:27.746 --> 01:21:32.650]  He's going to be hosting Sunday Night Live, taking your calls, covering other big breaking news stories.
[01:21:33.031 --> 01:21:34.933]  So we'll warm up the phone lines for him.
[01:21:35.733 --> 01:21:37.755]  And we'll start with Andrew in New York.
[01:21:37.855 --> 01:21:40.017]  Andrew, you are on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:21:40.038 --> 01:21:40.398]  Go ahead.
[01:21:44.347 --> 01:21:45.588]  All right.
[01:21:45.708 --> 01:21:46.088]  I love it.
[01:21:46.769 --> 01:21:48.089]  I just love it.
[01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:49.190]  Andrew, thank you for the call.
[01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.750]  Magic.
[01:21:50.571 --> 01:21:51.411]  Caller magic.
[01:21:51.571 --> 01:21:54.953]  Let's go to Anne in Pennsylvania.
[01:21:55.513 --> 01:21:56.754]  Anne, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:21:56.774 --> 01:21:57.174]  Go ahead.
[01:21:58.255 --> 01:21:58.695]  Hello.
[01:21:58.715 --> 01:21:59.816]  You're doing a great job.
[01:22:00.516 --> 01:22:00.756]  Thank you.
[01:22:00.776 --> 01:22:01.537]  You're doing a great job.
[01:22:01.557 --> 01:22:06.840]  So Michelle Bachman, amazing, amazing, amazing former congresswoman.
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:10.662]  She was laying it out the other day verbatim.
[01:22:11.477 --> 01:22:15.201]  Exactly what the WHO plans to do when they take a vote.
[01:22:15.261 --> 01:22:19.825]  I believe it's next May, and how convenient the year of the presidential election.
[01:22:19.945 --> 01:22:20.325]  Indeed.
[01:22:21.266 --> 01:22:26.431]  She listed everything, and by the way, they basically already have the vote.
[01:22:27.232 --> 01:22:29.674]  She explained that too, but there's still hope.
[01:22:30.355 --> 01:22:33.678]  She laid out verbatim exactly what they plan to do.
[01:22:33.698 --> 01:22:39.144]   Now, We all know that they want full control over our autonomy.
[01:22:39.565 --> 01:22:44.826]  They want to be able to force a jab, force masks, force lockdowns, do everything.
[01:22:45.526 --> 01:22:51.168]  And, you know, honestly, I've been, you know, I've been complaining about Congress.
[01:22:52.109 --> 01:22:55.730]  And I, for some reason, they seem to always get a pass.
[01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:59.051]  Why wasn't Marjorie Taylor Greene there?
[01:22:59.831 --> 01:23:01.072]  Why wasn't Ted Cruz?
[01:23:01.092 --> 01:23:02.212]  These are my favorite people.
[01:23:02.972 --> 01:23:09.893]  Okay, honestly, I'm sick to my stomach because, and this is the last thing I want to say because I don't want to take too much of your time.
[01:23:11.094 --> 01:23:18.395]  These people, what they want to do is they want to become, they want to pass this thing that even they call a treaty.
[01:23:19.395 --> 01:23:25.176]  They want to completely erode the United States Constitution.
[01:23:25.196 --> 01:23:26.597]  They want to have complete power.
[01:23:26.677 --> 01:23:27.717]  We're in America.
[01:23:28.097 --> 01:23:28.277]  Yes.
[01:23:29.711 --> 01:23:37.340]  And that was one of the big agendas with the pandemic is to say, oh, when you have a pandemic, it's a global thing.
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:38.821]  You can't act as a nation state.
[01:23:38.881 --> 01:23:40.143]  It's eroding our sovereignty.
[01:23:40.423 --> 01:23:42.045]  I'm glad Michelle Bachman understands it.
[01:23:42.365 --> 01:23:45.128]  We need more people to understand that in the media and in Congress.
[01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.970]  And it's just...
[01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:54.995]  Look, I will say, I'll play excuse maker, if you will, for Marjorie Taylor Greene, Ted Cruz, and the others.
[01:23:55.375 --> 01:23:57.717]  There's so many things they're dealing with right now in Congress.
[01:23:57.777 --> 01:23:58.698]  I'm not justifying this.
[01:23:58.758 --> 01:24:00.920]  If you listen to me, you know I've given them C's.
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.722]  Marjorie Taylor Greene might be the best Congresswoman.
[01:24:03.782 --> 01:24:04.743]  She gets a C grade.
[01:24:05.003 --> 01:24:05.824]  She's average.
[01:24:06.064 --> 01:24:08.966]  She's what our average congresswoman, congressman should be like.
[01:24:09.506 --> 01:24:12.028]  She'd get an A if she's doing exactly what you're talking about.
[01:24:12.268 --> 01:24:14.310]  But they got so many different things they're juggling.
[01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:16.111]  They're trying to expose the Biden crime family.
[01:24:16.131 --> 01:24:18.052]  They're dealing with the border and all kinds of different things.
[01:24:18.633 --> 01:24:19.533]  So it's a C effort.
[01:24:21.775 --> 01:24:24.056]  But I'm glad the issue is being talked about.
[01:24:24.076 --> 01:24:26.238]  We at least have until next May, it sounds like, to do something.
[01:24:26.518 --> 01:24:27.258]  Thanks for the call.
[01:24:27.859 --> 01:24:29.640]  And let's go to Michael in Texas.
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:30.501]  Michael, you're on the air.
[01:24:30.521 --> 01:24:30.861]  Go ahead.
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:35.403]  Owen, Owen, we have spoken once before.
[01:24:35.723 --> 01:24:48.914]  I am, I've been an info warrior since 2008 and I'm extremely disappointed at the pandering that you and Alex do with Trump and I'm glad you mentioned MTG.
[01:24:51.249 --> 01:24:54.730]  One of the ramifications of this debt ceiling deal, and you know what?
[01:24:54.750 --> 01:24:58.171]  We might as well have left Nancy Pelosi in as Speaker of the House.
[01:24:58.591 --> 01:25:04.873]  And by the way, MPG was the first one to break from the Freedom Caucus and endorse this McCarthy character.
[01:25:05.213 --> 01:25:10.274]  You might as well have put in, you should change your name to Kevin Romney for crying out loud.
[01:25:10.294 --> 01:25:11.474]  I mean, the guy's a Democrat.
[01:25:12.154 --> 01:25:13.335]  You might as well, right?
[01:25:13.355 --> 01:25:14.935]  So here's the biggest ramification.
[01:25:15.735 --> 01:25:18.296]  They're killing the student loan moratorium.
[01:25:19.139 --> 01:25:24.264]  Owen, this is going to put millions of Americans in default.
[01:25:24.905 --> 01:25:31.091]  Think what that's going to do to the economy when millions have that on the credit report.
[01:25:31.432 --> 01:25:32.553]  Trying to get a home.
[01:25:33.013 --> 01:25:34.115]  Trying to get a car.
[01:25:34.575 --> 01:25:35.376]  Think about that.
[01:25:35.956 --> 01:25:36.657]  So what?
[01:25:36.777 --> 01:25:39.040]  So you want the student debt forgiveness?
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.220]  Absolutely!
[01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:42.181]  Absolutely!
[01:25:42.641 --> 01:25:45.842]  And I know your feelings on that, but absolutely.
[01:25:46.222 --> 01:25:55.985]  If we could send billions of dollars every year to all these different countries around the world... Okay, now see, that's a totally different argument.
[01:25:56.025 --> 01:26:07.908]  Now, I understand why you connect the two issues, and it's fair enough, but you have to understand, spending all the money overseas does not equate to, let's pay off Americans' debts domestically.
[01:26:09.383 --> 01:26:10.364]  Like, I agree.
[01:26:10.424 --> 01:26:11.885]  Let's stop all the international spending.
[01:26:12.065 --> 01:26:18.549]  You want to sit here and talk to me about government, healthcare, or any of this crap, don't say a damn word to me until you stop foreign spending.
[01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:19.710]  I completely agree with that.
[01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:24.973]  But just stopping foreign aid doesn't mean we start enacting communist policies domestically.
[01:26:25.894 --> 01:26:28.676]  Well, well, let me draw the hypocrisy.
[01:26:29.496 --> 01:26:34.789]   Because I guess nobody had a problem With that PPP forgiveness.
[01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:38.436]  MTG, I've seen reports up to $184,000 in 100% forgiveness.
[01:26:42.879 --> 01:26:48.903]  And she goes out and buys a $600,000 plus apartment in Washington District of Criminals.
[01:26:49.443 --> 01:27:06.694]  I've seen reports from Matt Gaetz that up to a half a million forgiven, but John Smith, who's making $18 an hour, who tried to better himself, but between the government and the corporations, screwing his career, so he can't get 10 grand forgiven.
[01:27:06.994 --> 01:27:08.435]  He's going to go into the false.
[01:27:09.432 --> 01:27:19.598]  So if he's a renter, and he needs to rent a new home, and he's denied, he winds up in a long-term hotel, which are disgusting, or he sits in his car.
[01:27:20.119 --> 01:27:22.060]  Oh, it's the same equivalent.
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.281]  It's the same hypocrisy.
[01:27:24.501 --> 01:27:34.287]  And we've got all the money in the world, as you mentioned earlier, you know, about the illegals getting hotels, and our armed service men and women getting kicked out.
[01:27:34.847 --> 01:27:36.749]  It's the same hypocrisy, my friend.
[01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:38.950]  And that's the problem I have.
[01:27:39.995 --> 01:27:44.759]  They can do for themselves and nobody backs an eye for voice.
[01:27:44.979 --> 01:27:48.602]  Do something for Johnny and Jane American and we spit on it.
[01:27:49.062 --> 01:27:50.963]  It makes no sense to me.
[01:27:51.364 --> 01:28:02.292]  And another thing about MCG, again, I don't like the fact that she goes on with Alex Jones last week or two weeks ago, whatever it was, and she talked about this impeachment thing.
[01:28:03.152 --> 01:28:08.625]   She and Alex Doesn't explain the process that it'll die in the Senate.
[01:28:08.905 --> 01:28:11.707]  You'll never get 67... Alright, Michael.
[01:28:11.767 --> 01:28:13.448]  Well, this is why we open up the lines.
[01:28:13.488 --> 01:28:14.489]  We want to hear from everybody.
[01:28:14.509 --> 01:28:15.349]  Fair points made.
[01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:17.531]  That's it for me tonight on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:17.551 --> 01:28:18.732]  Harrison Smith taking over.
[01:28:18.772 --> 01:28:19.632]  But stay on that line.
[01:28:19.452 --> 01:28:20.452]  He'll take your call.
[01:28:20.452 --> 01:28:27.452]  [music]

[01:30:13.058 --> 01:30:14.679]  But we got another amazing interview.
