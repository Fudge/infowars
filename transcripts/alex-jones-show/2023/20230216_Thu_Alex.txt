[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:07.891]  They can't get this project through if, when it launches, the public, a large portion of the public, knows what it is and what its evil aims are.
[00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:22.354]  And so, all of you get the credit, and yes, I've gone through a lot of pain and a lot of suffering, but it's been well worth it, because the taste of victory is so sweet, to get to this point, and we have achieved our primary mission.
[00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:32.526]   We have achieved the primary mission That was literally laid on my heart by God when I was 18 years old.
[00:00:33.987 --> 00:00:44.610]  When God touched my heart, the Holy Spirit reproved me to stop what I was doing and to stand up against evil.
[00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:48.892]  And I accepted that and repented.
[00:00:50.252 --> 00:00:51.913]  And then the gates of knowledge were opened.
[00:00:56.713 --> 00:01:01.714]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:01.553 --> 00:01:03.553]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:03.553 --> 00:01:18.112]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's
[00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:20.554]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.660]  You better believe!
[00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:31.896]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:31.896 --> 00:01:38.896]  [Music]
[00:01:38.896 --> 00:01:41.476]  (upbeat music)
[00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:42.379]  Stay at home.
[00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.941]  That is the order tonight from four state governors.
[00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:48.504]  You absolutely must stay at home.
[00:01:48.664 --> 00:01:50.245]  You must stay at home.
[00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:53.568]  All gatherings are canceled until further notice.
[00:01:53.748 --> 00:01:55.869]  I have issued an executive order.
[00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.731]   It's not A suggestion.
[00:01:58.071 --> 00:01:58.612]  It's an order.
[00:01:58.832 --> 00:01:59.872]  We will shut you down.
[00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:00.953]  We will cite you.
[00:02:01.113 --> 00:02:05.637]  And if we need to, we will arrest you and we will take you to jail.
[00:02:05.777 --> 00:02:10.160]  This means no weddings, in-person services, or even parties.
[00:02:11.782 --> 00:02:15.865]  The time for educating people into compliance is over.
[00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:21.369]  I'm using my power as governor under an emergency declaration to order you to close.
[00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:23.871]  Quarantine will be mandatory.
[00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.393]  I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this.
[00:02:26.973 --> 00:02:32.916]  Those few bad actors will be identified and the Tampa Police Department will handle it.
[00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:36.578]  We're watching you and we are going to take decisive action.
[00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.820]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:45.162]  Because there is a war on for your minds.
[00:02:45.802 --> 00:02:53.006]  I mean I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful and I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute.
[00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.192]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[00:02:57.292 --> 00:03:00.555]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:03.578]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.602]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:16.392]  Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints.
[00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:32.236]  Everything that's in the other documents, but this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and force vaccines and the hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[00:03:34.617 --> 00:03:38.479]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:40.821]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:43.982]  You're not going to be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:03:44.743 --> 00:03:45.263]  It's scary.
[00:03:48.508 --> 00:03:54.590]  One thing the NFL really plans to do this year is take as many precautions as possible just to keep everybody safe.
[00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.891]  And that starts with the vast majority of teams deciding already that there will be no fans at all allowed inside the stadium for the games.
[00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:11.054]  And every single player in the league has been given a smart tag tracking device to help them keep their distance off the field and for contact tracing should it become necessary.
[00:04:11.454 --> 00:04:13.315]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[00:04:14.015 --> 00:04:17.496]  Players are not excited about this kind of idea of no fans.
[00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:19.837]  Yes, but they may have to get used to it.
[00:04:19.937 --> 00:04:24.138]  But all around the country there will be empty stadiums and masks on the sidelines.
[00:04:24.358 --> 00:04:26.139]  No fans will be allowed in.
[00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:31.760]  I can't imagine Howie playing in the NFL this day and time with no fans there.
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.081]  I honestly can't even conceive that.
[00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:36.622]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:39.783]  You're not going to be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:04:39.803 --> 00:04:41.164]  Don't get the vaccine?
[00:04:41.824 --> 00:04:43.245]  You can't go to the supermarket.
[00:04:43.525 --> 00:04:44.325]  Don't have the vaccine?
[00:04:44.345 --> 00:04:45.706]  You can't go to the ballgame.
[00:04:46.206 --> 00:04:47.066]  Don't have the vaccine?
[00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:48.327]  Can't go to work.
[00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:56.350]  Because everybody in the establishment will still kind of halfway listen now and go, well he's been right about everything else, maybe we should look into this.
[00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.811]  Look, you'll believe it if they release it.
[00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:00.932]  So just remember this transmission then.
[00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:09.565]  The Orange County Coroner's Office is investigating the death of a woman who passed away several days after getting her second Moderna vaccine.
[00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:15.469]  She died after suffering blood clots just over a week after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine.
[00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:20.152]  Her 58-year-old mother died less than an hour after receiving the Pfizer vaccine.
[00:05:20.392 --> 00:05:21.713]  My little sister just died.
[00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:24.013]  Her first dose.
[00:05:24.373 --> 00:05:30.177]  And in Orange County, an x-ray technician has died after getting his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
[00:05:30.457 --> 00:05:34.100]  His dad died four days after getting his second shot of Pfizer vaccine.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.702]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion.
[00:05:38.182 --> 00:05:42.305]  I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[00:05:43.466 --> 00:05:47.609]  I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.651]  You really need to get vaccinated.
[00:05:52.924 --> 00:05:55.386]  Don't resist when they release the bioweapon.
[00:05:55.587 --> 00:05:58.249]  Submit and die with pleasure!
[00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:03.073]  InfoWars.
[00:06:03.434 --> 00:06:04.335]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:05.035]  Today.
[00:06:06.296 --> 00:06:07.117]  InfoWars.
[00:06:07.778 --> 00:06:08.899]  And your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.461]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:06:12.462 --> 00:06:12.942]  Today.
[00:06:13.983 --> 00:06:15.905]  It's Thursday, February 16th, 2023.
[00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:22.581]  I'll be here live in the next four hours ahead of Owen Schroeder 3 p.m.
[00:06:22.621 --> 00:06:28.584]  Central today on the Info Wars radio TV slash web network.
[00:06:30.426 --> 00:07:01.697]   You know last night after my daughter went to sleep I did a couple hours research there on my desktop and without even looking I saw Elon Musk and Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and then all these world leaders as well, both those promoting it and those saying it was bad, just talking about world government and the new world order and how the private corporations are running things, want to take control of our bodies and lives, and how we've got to form an opposition against it.
[00:07:03.544 --> 00:07:15.911]  And just like that, all the pre-programming, all the brainwashing, all the lies, saying never talk about a world government, never talk about its agenda, all the intimidation of decades and decades and decades failed.
[00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:32.920]  And at the World Government Summit that ended just two days ago, Elon Musk beamed into the event and said, I'm against your world government and it's dangerous and will collapse the planet, which is its plan to take control.
[00:07:34.946 --> 00:07:37.907]  A new feudalism, the technocracy on its ashes.
[00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:41.369]  And so it's an amazing moment here.
[00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:57.235]  And how many times have longtime listeners or regular listeners heard me say, my mission, my primary mission that I started out with 28 years ago will be complete.
[00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:10.154]  When we at least have the world government out in the open and there's major opposition against it and it's normalized to realize it exists and to stand against it because its goals are bad for humanity.
[00:08:10.374 --> 00:08:11.775]  When I say bad, that's an understatement.
[00:08:12.895 --> 00:08:14.235]  And so I'm not obsolete.
[00:08:15.176 --> 00:08:16.296]  I'm not vestigial.
[00:08:17.837 --> 00:08:20.117]  I've not been made irrelevant.
[00:08:21.578 --> 00:08:21.838]  Yet.
[00:08:24.499 --> 00:08:25.519]  But that's my goal.
[00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:46.000]  That my understanding and my knowledge, that many other great men and women before me understood before I was born, but was only known by a tiny one-tenth of one percent of people in America and a few other countries, that that would be mainlined so the whole New World Order project would have to face resistance.
[00:08:47.529 --> 00:08:57.332]  And so I want to just sit back here today for all the listeners and all the viewers and all the activists and the crew and our sponsors and those that have made this broadcast possible and all the amazing guests.
[00:08:58.352 --> 00:09:00.213]  And I want us just to pause for a moment.
[00:09:00.233 --> 00:09:04.554]  In fact, I forgot to tell the crew to do this.
[00:09:05.234 --> 00:09:10.576]  Will you guys pull up some video or audio of a standing ovation or a crowd applauding?
[00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:16.383]  Maybe that short clip before they cut my voice in with operatic singing.
[00:09:16.423 --> 00:09:17.223]  It's like 30 seconds long.
[00:09:17.243 --> 00:09:17.923]  Cue that up in a moment.
[00:09:17.943 --> 00:09:20.364]  I want to play it as a salute to everybody.
[00:09:20.384 --> 00:09:21.905]  Or maybe we should have a 21-gun salute.
[00:09:23.185 --> 00:09:31.849]  But they can't get this project through if, when it launches, the public, a large portion of the public, knows what it is and what its evil aims are.
[00:09:32.549 --> 00:09:35.050]  And so all of you get the credit.
[00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:39.932]  And yes, I've gone through a lot of pain and a lot of suffering, but it's been well worth it.
[00:09:40.762 --> 00:09:42.303]  Because the taste of victory is so sweet.
[00:09:43.224 --> 00:09:46.306]  To get to this point, and we have achieved our primary mission.
[00:09:48.027 --> 00:09:56.472]  We have achieved the primary mission that was literally laid on my heart by God when I was 18 years old.
[00:09:57.933 --> 00:10:08.500]  When God touched my heart, the Holy Spirit reproved me to stop what I was doing and to stand up against evil.
[00:10:10.237 --> 00:10:12.838]  And I accepted that and repented.
[00:10:14.178 --> 00:10:15.859]  And then the gates of knowledge were opened.
[00:10:16.859 --> 00:10:24.602]  And then about four years later, after I've been on air only about a year, I've told the story a hundred times, probably.
[00:10:26.222 --> 00:10:32.825]  After my access TV show, I went and got a chicken fried steak, got a beer, maybe it was iced tea, I don't remember.
[00:10:34.045 --> 00:10:36.546]  And the restaurant was basically empty by nine o'clock at night.
[00:10:37.782 --> 00:10:41.525]  And God said, now I'm going to give you the blueprint for victory.
[00:10:43.347 --> 00:10:45.189]  And it was, it was incredible.
[00:10:45.209 --> 00:10:46.510]  It was, it was hard to digest.
[00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:53.896]  It was so complex, but it was like knowledge was just being poured in and the gates were open to knowledge and the next level.
[00:10:54.457 --> 00:10:59.841]  And I saw basically everything that was coming and what my mission was and what was going to then unfold.
[00:11:00.282 --> 00:11:02.544]  If I had the courage to face what was going to happen in the end.
[00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:06.492]  Because history repeats itself.
[00:11:06.752 --> 00:11:07.692]  It doesn't just rhyme.
[00:11:09.813 --> 00:11:21.317]  And anybody knows that somebody that comes out of the wilderness at a major time of change, who is the fire starter that triggers the next wave that defeats the evil, you know what happens to those people.
[00:11:22.157 --> 00:11:25.238]  And God said, you're going to be attacked.
[00:11:25.258 --> 00:11:28.199]  You're going to be absolutely, in the end, destroyed.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:45.023]  But you are going to launch the modern resistance, and you're going to see leaders appear that are going to take humanity out of the darkness, and you are going to be the main impetus that triggers that.
[00:11:47.444 --> 00:11:54.765]  And I've been telling you that story for more than 15 years, and I just share these private moments with you, and I share the total truth of it.
[00:11:55.545 --> 00:11:58.106]  I was a whoremonger.
[00:11:59.113 --> 00:12:01.714]  I mean, I just could not stay away from women.
[00:12:01.854 --> 00:12:03.474]  And, you know, there's, I'm sure, worse sins.
[00:12:04.534 --> 00:12:08.875]  But that's what I dedicated my time to, was dating as many women as I could.
[00:12:10.956 --> 00:12:13.057]  And the byproduct of that was abortion.
[00:12:14.357 --> 00:12:19.578]  And God just hit me like Saul on the road to Damascus with a thunderbolt.
[00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:23.379]  That's how I'd really describe it.
[00:12:23.619 --> 00:12:28.013]   I didn't get knocked off a horse, I didn't see bright light, but it was like, Nightmares, you name it.
[00:12:28.033 --> 00:12:28.793]  You better stop.
[00:12:29.253 --> 00:12:30.254]  What you're doing is wrong.
[00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:32.235]  Don't ever kill children again.
[00:12:32.775 --> 00:12:33.716]  Those are my children.
[00:12:34.876 --> 00:12:36.437]  You'll be damned to hell if you continue.
[00:12:36.477 --> 00:12:38.118]  It was just like, what is this?
[00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:39.058]  Night after night.
[00:12:39.299 --> 00:12:40.559]  Until I said, God, I'm sorry.
[00:12:40.438 --> 00:12:42.438]  I won't do this anymore.
[00:12:42.438 --> 00:12:52.217]  And then I went on my mission.
[00:12:52.217 --> 00:13:02.218]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:59.629]   And just four years later, I got the download.
[00:13:02.351 --> 00:13:08.116]  And I talked about this about a month and a half ago that I got another big download, even bigger than that one.
[00:13:09.837 --> 00:13:13.660]  And I just can't even, it takes time to even understand this or decipher it.
[00:13:14.241 --> 00:13:24.029]  And so that's why I've been taking some time off and things because I've just got to spend sometimes hours a day praying and trying to get sanctified and close to God to even understand this knowledge.
[00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:31.997]  And when I finally get in the quiet place, the most high that King David talked about, then I can understand it because it's so powerful.
[00:13:32.057 --> 00:13:32.517]  It's God.
[00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:43.928]  And to be in that presence, not just the Holy Spirit, the comforter for spiritual babies to love us and care about us and feel God's love, but it's the next level.
[00:13:44.009 --> 00:13:45.610]  It's the war.
[00:13:47.072 --> 00:13:48.133]  And it's deadly serious.
[00:13:50.402 --> 00:13:55.746]  And so, I've been processing that and going through that, and the enemy knows that's happening.
[00:13:56.147 --> 00:13:57.508]  They have spiritual eyes to see.
[00:13:57.568 --> 00:13:59.289]  They'll give it to them by their father, the devil.
[00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:05.074]  And they know what's happened to me, and this whole family that is InfoWars is something very, very special.
[00:14:05.915 --> 00:14:13.661]  And so, I'm going to really do my best to not just cover the past or the present, but tell you what's coming in the future.
[00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:24.660]   And this human mind has real trouble deciphering the things of the spirit that are so much more advanced,
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:34.302]   so much more complex, so much more deep and long and eternal and timeless.
[00:14:34.302 --> 00:14:44.381]   And you get into that zone and it's total completion and total confidence and it's hard to leave that zone
[00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:50.741]   and then come back into this zone and then contend with what you see going on around you.
[00:14:50.742 --> 00:14:53.283]  Especially when you still have your flesh.
[00:14:55.284 --> 00:14:57.445]  It's like a big ball and chain around your leg.
[00:14:57.485 --> 00:14:58.325]  You're still a sinner.
[00:14:59.045 --> 00:15:07.788]  You still have all those things in you of a fallen creature, but you're on the top of the mountain staring into infinity and God's eyes.
[00:15:09.566 --> 00:15:10.667]  It's quite the paradox.
[00:15:11.668 --> 00:15:17.052]  I only wish our enemies could taste, taste God's knowledge and they would never serve Satan.
[00:15:18.353 --> 00:15:25.498]  We'll be right back with all the news and more on this powerful Thursday broadcast as we go in, through and beyond.
[00:15:25.518 --> 00:15:34.925]  We salute all the viewers and listeners and everybody.
[00:15:35.802 --> 00:15:38.165]  But expose the World Government's plans ahead of their launch.
[00:15:38.746 --> 00:15:40.388]  And now their program is in deep trouble.
[00:15:40.888 --> 00:15:43.392]  And Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab are running scared.
[00:15:43.412 --> 00:15:45.935]  They haven't won the war.
[00:15:45.955 --> 00:15:49.099]  But now humanity's awake and we're winning battles.
[00:15:48.918 --> 00:16:15.318]  The enemy will strike back though, so get ready.
[00:16:15.318 --> 00:16:19.597]   So we are inspired by the creator of the universe and beyond.
[00:16:20.493 --> 00:16:26.314]  We were created by that all-powerful, all-knowing, eternal entity.
[00:16:29.235 --> 00:16:34.196]  But there are lesser entities, hell-bent on controlling humanity.
[00:16:35.237 --> 00:16:45.374]   And in the year 2023, the world awakened to the criminal, murderous, transhumanist, satanic, pedophile-run globalist system.
[00:16:48.397 --> 00:16:56.144]  What a victory that they are now trying to hide it in plain view after denying their plan the entire time.
[00:16:57.305 --> 00:17:12.046]   And whether Elon Musk is good or bad, or in between, He knows the ship of world government is sinking and at their own event told them they are wrong and what they're doing is dangerous and anti-human.
[00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:32.468]   He then went on To challenge world leaders to stop being puppets and reading a global script and to go on Twitter and to go on other sites and actually talk to the people and get in there with the people and be real and that that would empower them and humanity.
[00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.691]  That is a big, big deal.
[00:17:42.731 --> 00:17:44.731]  So I salute you all.
[00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:51.731]  [Applause]
[00:17:51.731 --> 00:17:53.731]  We did it with God's help.
[00:17:54.457 --> 00:17:54.937]  God did it.
[00:17:54.957 --> 00:18:01.182]  They'll bring in their full system soon, though, and then they'll be defeated by God.
[00:18:02.903 --> 00:18:04.064]  They win in the third quarter.
[00:18:04.104 --> 00:18:05.264]  We win in the fourth quarter.
[00:18:07.166 --> 00:18:11.469]  But we're now over the top, entering the third quarter.
[00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:14.271]  They lose, though.
[00:18:18.414 --> 00:18:20.335]  Make no mistake about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:21.624 --> 00:18:22.785]  Make no mistake about that.
[00:18:23.926 --> 00:18:24.306]  Woo!
[00:18:25.286 --> 00:18:27.308]  Ha ha ha!
[00:18:27.548 --> 00:18:33.512]  28 years standing on greater people's shoulders, but the mission of Implowars is legendary now.
[00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:41.637]  And all of you, don't just get participation trophies, because your participation was the victory.
[00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:44.874]  Whether you told ten people, or a thousand, or a million.
[00:18:45.454 --> 00:18:47.535]  Whether you stood up to evil once, or a hundred times.
[00:18:48.296 --> 00:18:51.918]  Whether you were doing the right thing just a few times, or only some of the time.
[00:18:52.158 --> 00:18:58.302]  If you did the best job you could in front of God, you're the reason the world is awakening, and I salute you.
[00:18:59.783 --> 00:19:04.265]  You know, I had some guests scheduled today, but I went ahead and canceled them, because I want to take calls.
[00:19:05.426 --> 00:19:08.228]  And yesterday, I said, there's two topics I want to hear from you on.
[00:19:08.728 --> 00:19:11.510]  The war, World War III, how to stop it, and they were amazing calls.
[00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:18.058]  But I said also, what do you make of them admitting world government now, and then it wants to take over your body and run your life for your own good?
[00:19:19.199 --> 00:19:20.720]  What do you make of that being out in the open?
[00:19:22.362 --> 00:19:24.004]  And how they admit their world government's in trouble?
[00:19:25.356 --> 00:19:30.660]  Well, they admit to give us this utopia they've got planned for us that we see as a dystopian nightmare.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.642]  They've got to censor us and surveil us and control us.
[00:19:33.702 --> 00:19:39.766]  And as you all know, Harari said, take some of us away so the government can help us get better in re-education camps.
[00:19:40.006 --> 00:19:44.349]  And they've built the re-education camps under the guise of the FEMA centers, all under UN auspices.
[00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:52.595]  So yes, we're in very dark territory, but it's in that darkness that people learn to love the light.
[00:19:53.772 --> 00:20:02.355]  And begin to look around them and get out of their stupor, out of their learned helplessness, and realize that resistance is victory.
[00:20:04.756 --> 00:20:08.397]  So I want to open the phones up, coming up relatively early.
[00:20:08.417 --> 00:20:09.898]  I'm going to get the calls up by the end of the hour.
[00:20:11.359 --> 00:20:16.640]  But I want to just hit some of the news we're going to intersperse during the broadcast today, and breaking news as it comes in.
[00:20:18.021 --> 00:20:20.422]  But this is really important.
[00:20:21.448 --> 00:20:34.172]  And I've got six, seven clips here from the World Government Summit we haven't gotten to yet, but I really think a clip of this magnitude should be aired two days in a row, three days in a row, ten days in a row, a hundred days in a row.
[00:20:34.632 --> 00:20:46.816]  Guys, get Elon Musk from two days ago beaming into the World Government Summit in Dubai, where he says, you're wrong, and you're endangering humanity, and you're going to cause a global collapse.
[00:20:49.451 --> 00:20:50.572]  Which is actually their plan.
[00:20:51.332 --> 00:20:53.234]  And he knows that, and he's being diplomatic.
[00:20:53.274 --> 00:21:02.200]  And again, no matter what you think of him, to go to their event and to tell them this is explosive.
[00:21:03.641 --> 00:21:11.647]  And then you've got Joe Rogan coming out, and there's a New World Order that wants to enslave you, and wants to take over your body, and wants to make you eat bugs.
[00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:19.033]  And now suddenly almost all the other commentators that are popular are saying that because they know that's where the audience is.
[00:21:19.233 --> 00:21:20.694]  And I've known Joe 25 years.
[00:21:21.194 --> 00:21:22.594]  Joe knew about this back when I did.
[00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:23.575]  He's just as smart as I am.
[00:21:23.595 --> 00:21:26.176]  That's why I've been irritated with him at times.
[00:21:26.015 --> 00:21:43.374]   But now Joe, who's a very calculated person, very smart, now his shows are like Alex Jones.
[00:21:43.374 --> 00:21:47.894]   You know I told you about two years ago when he was going to move to Austin, before it
[00:21:47.894 --> 00:21:50.734]  was announced, I said, "Joe Rogan's about to get hardcore."
[00:21:51.364 --> 00:21:53.705]  And he did for a while and kind of pulled back to assess it.
[00:21:54.365 --> 00:21:56.266]  And then now he's decided to go full on.
[00:21:57.106 --> 00:21:58.326]  And it's going to be spectacular.
[00:21:58.626 --> 00:22:01.147]  And again, Joe Rogan is just a bellwether in this.
[00:22:02.227 --> 00:22:04.868]  A weather vane, a gauge, a sensor.
[00:22:06.653 --> 00:22:15.322]  And when you look at all the other big commentators, I mean almost all of them now coming out against the New World Order, a lot of Democrats coming out against the shot, coming out against lockdown, saying they didn't know, they were wrong.
[00:22:15.982 --> 00:22:17.704]  They're rats leaving a sinking ship.
[00:22:17.724 --> 00:22:20.707]  And I'm not saying Joe's one of those, because he hasn't been in bed with them.
[00:22:20.727 --> 00:22:25.031]  He just kind of knew what was going on, but rode the fence like a surfer.
[00:22:26.035 --> 00:22:27.436]  But now he's no longer lukewarm.
[00:22:27.456 --> 00:22:28.116]  He's jumped in.
[00:22:28.596 --> 00:22:29.817]  And so has Elon Musk.
[00:22:29.877 --> 00:22:32.078]  People say, man, Joe Rogan's Alex Jones.
[00:22:32.098 --> 00:22:32.619]  It's all over Twitter.
[00:22:32.639 --> 00:22:33.459]  In fact, it was trending yesterday.
[00:22:33.739 --> 00:22:35.060]  Joe Rogan's the new Alex Jones.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.261]  Elon Musk's the new Alex Jones.
[00:22:36.841 --> 00:22:38.142]  Well, you're all Alex Jones.
[00:22:39.482 --> 00:22:43.905]  Just because I saw this and popularized it didn't mean it was something that I created.
[00:22:44.205 --> 00:22:49.228]  Didn't mean it was my pipe dream that just so happened to come true or a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:22:49.268 --> 00:22:50.628]  No, I was reading their own documents.
[00:22:50.689 --> 00:22:52.009]  I was reading their own books.
[00:22:52.069 --> 00:22:52.990]  I was studying them.
[00:22:54.363 --> 00:23:03.870]  But that's why I say this victory that we need to go ahead and accept and thank God for in a Thanksgiving is so massive.
[00:23:06.813 --> 00:23:09.235]  Last January, I told you the COVID narrative was broken.
[00:23:09.795 --> 00:23:10.736]  It's going to fall apart.
[00:23:12.397 --> 00:23:13.838]  It'll take time, but they're in trouble.
[00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:18.161]  And I'm telling you now, ladies and gentlemen, they're starting wars.
[00:23:18.181 --> 00:23:19.362]  They're getting new viruses ready.
[00:23:19.402 --> 00:23:20.423]  I'll cover that next segment.
[00:23:20.844 --> 00:23:22.245]  They're geared up for hell itself.
[00:23:23.311 --> 00:23:30.276]  But if you look at the long-term trajectory of this, they are going down big time.
[00:23:32.958 --> 00:23:33.419]  Big time.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:41.825]  Now it's going to be painful for those of us at the tip of the spear, but it's also a great honor and exactly where I want to be.
[00:23:42.685 --> 00:23:47.769]  So no matter what happens to me, remember we are victorious because we chose our fate.
[00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.212]  We didn't just roll over and be bystanders in the middle of the road.
[00:23:51.272 --> 00:23:52.393]  We chose our lane.
[00:23:53.814 --> 00:23:55.715]  So I'm going to play some of these clips on world government.
[00:23:56.716 --> 00:24:04.561]  Then I'm going to get into the big New World Order, World Treaty, and oh, they're fear-mongering a new virus that's already out there that kills 90% of humans.
[00:24:05.702 --> 00:24:06.862]  It's all coming up.
[00:24:07.383 --> 00:24:09.384]  Big broadcast today.
[00:24:09.844 --> 00:24:11.485]  Tell folks you know, tune in now.
[00:24:11.786 --> 00:24:12.506]  That's how we win.
[00:24:14.007 --> 00:24:21.332]  Again, the globalists wanted their world government, their world ID, their social credit score, their carbon tax, their universal basic income.
[00:24:23.137 --> 00:24:25.858]  To sneak up on people and just be adopted.
[00:24:26.758 --> 00:24:27.859]  They didn't want to debate about it.
[00:24:27.879 --> 00:24:28.979]  They didn't want to fight about it.
[00:24:29.599 --> 00:24:30.519]  They just wanted to do it.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:40.643]  But thanks to this family that is InfoWars, and there's a lot of other great organizations and groups as well to get the credit, we now have a real fighting chance.
[00:24:41.743 --> 00:24:47.685]  This is historical in the species, history, and our present, and our future.
[00:24:48.519 --> 00:24:52.605]  And so it's important to recognize what your sacrifices have done.
[00:24:52.805 --> 00:24:55.229]  Let me tell you what's coming up today, then I'll give the number out.
[00:24:57.092 --> 00:25:04.342]  We have a huge group of studies and articles about men and women are no longer going to exist because chemicals in the water are making us asexual.
[00:25:05.265 --> 00:25:08.668]  I told you this 20 years ago, it's their plan, but here it is.
[00:25:09.448 --> 00:25:12.410]  Science needs to stop using terms like male, female, mother, father.
[00:25:12.991 --> 00:25:19.256]  Researchers say, New York Post, university-level gender classes teaches that chromosomes don't exist.
[00:25:20.236 --> 00:25:21.237]  Don't determine sex.
[00:25:22.658 --> 00:25:29.984]  Gestational exposure to phthalates and gender-related play behaviors in 8-year-old children in an observational study.
[00:25:31.428 --> 00:25:32.608]  Turning little boys into girls.
[00:25:33.369 --> 00:25:37.130]  Turning girls into hyper-girls, which over-ages them, accelerates them.
[00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.911]  Wall Street Journal report says you should stop eating to save money.
[00:25:43.652 --> 00:25:50.014]  Privacy advocates, activists sound alarm on 15-minute cities that could easily allow for climate lockdowns.
[00:25:50.275 --> 00:25:51.315]  Uh, that's the amended plan.
[00:25:53.032 --> 00:25:57.674]  And the Deep State is now announcing that they want to ban all cars, including electric.
[00:25:57.694 --> 00:25:58.454]  Got a big U.N.
[00:25:59.115 --> 00:25:59.795]  study right here.
[00:26:00.135 --> 00:26:03.157]  So there's that stack that I'll be covering.
[00:26:04.217 --> 00:26:06.438]  Then we have this stack on the pedos.
[00:26:07.078 --> 00:26:11.981]  DeSantis reveals shocking porn books being removed from Florida schools.
[00:26:12.401 --> 00:26:14.922]  Remember Christy Lee's child in sixth grade?
[00:26:16.479 --> 00:26:21.663]  I alerted her to this same book where children have sex with each other and with adults.
[00:26:21.763 --> 00:26:23.604]  So it's a pedophile book.
[00:26:26.306 --> 00:26:28.147]  And it's in the public schools all over the country.
[00:26:30.649 --> 00:26:33.831]  And the left calls it anti-LGBTQP.
[00:26:34.892 --> 00:26:36.112]  Well, yeah, we're against pedophilia.
[00:26:36.893 --> 00:26:45.412]   So we've got that stack of related news that we're going to be getting to
[00:26:45.412 --> 00:26:48.751]  that teaches children to get in vans with men that pull up.
[00:26:48.751 --> 00:26:50.633]  Well, that's really good to teach kids.
[00:26:50.633 --> 00:26:54.333]   You know, you see these TV shows and they've got educational films
[00:26:54.333 --> 00:26:57.353]  that I've shown all four of my children.
[00:26:57.353 --> 00:27:01.592]  Three of my children are basically grown up, 20, 18, 15.
[00:27:01.592 --> 00:27:06.192]   One of them is a five and a half and we're just getting around to showing her
[00:27:06.192 --> 00:27:10.511]   videos of what you do if somebody tries to grab your arm or take you away what you do.
[00:27:11.077 --> 00:27:18.299]  But the Democrats have all these books saying if a man pulls up and says, get in the back of the vehicle with him, get in the back of the vehicle with him, it's going to be wonderful.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:26.281]  Or if your adult neighbor wants to go in the tool shed with you, it's going to be very fun when he does.
[00:27:26.301 --> 00:27:29.162]  It's going to be a great experience to be molested.
[00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:31.930]  This is happening.
[00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.551]  This isn't some nightmare fever dream.
[00:27:34.571 --> 00:27:36.032]  They're doing this.
[00:27:37.673 --> 00:27:39.873]  We have the World Government stack I'm going to be getting to next.
[00:27:43.555 --> 00:27:44.855]  And then we have this stack.
[00:27:45.936 --> 00:27:56.980]  Not and, there's many more stacks, but the whole poison shot stack that is particularly thick today because I didn't get to the stack yesterday.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.321]  So it's two days of articles.
[00:28:01.152 --> 00:28:02.314]  But this is about 30 articles.
[00:28:02.355 --> 00:28:02.555]  Let me see.
[00:28:02.375 --> 00:28:12.515]   I'm gonna see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
[00:28:12.515 --> 00:28:24.835]   thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two,
[00:28:24.835 --> 00:28:38.884]  24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37...
[00:28:38.884 --> 00:28:41.375]  37 Artles.
[00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:40.430]  Sorry, I said about 30.
[00:28:41.011 --> 00:28:42.933]  See, I'm not exaggerating.
[00:28:42.953 --> 00:28:42.933]  37!
[00:28:43.653 --> 00:28:49.938]  Each article more hellish confirming mass death, sterilization, heart attacks, absolute insanity.
[00:28:50.259 --> 00:28:51.039]  Just look at that.
[00:28:51.059 --> 00:28:51.920]  Do the whole show on that.
[00:28:52.741 --> 00:28:57.585]  Video clips, all the admissions, scientists, actuaries, insurance companies, just total hell on earth.
[00:28:57.704 --> 00:29:01.224]   Or you can just go back to me 20 years ago and telling you all this is coming with exact precision.
[00:29:01.224 --> 00:29:09.223]   Maybe I should just do the next three and a half hours on this.
[00:29:09.223 --> 00:29:19.223]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:29:15.557 --> 00:29:17.119]  Then we've got the race war stack.
[00:29:17.699 --> 00:29:19.421]  Then we've got the carbon tax stack.
[00:29:19.721 --> 00:29:21.643]  Then we've got the Russian-Ukraine war stack.
[00:29:21.903 --> 00:29:23.344]  Then we've got the inflation stack.
[00:29:23.524 --> 00:29:25.106]  Then we've got the crime exploding stack.
[00:29:25.426 --> 00:29:27.088]  Then we've got the drag queen pedo stack.
[00:29:27.588 --> 00:29:32.109]   Then we've got the JP Morgan, Jeffrey Epstein stack, which is Pino.
[00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.833]  And just on and on and on and on and on and on and on!
[00:29:35.873 --> 00:29:37.873]  and the election 2024 stack.
[00:29:37.873 --> 00:29:45.552]  That's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:46.344 --> 00:29:47.205]  That's what we're dealing with.
[00:29:48.606 --> 00:29:49.387]  That's what we're covering.
[00:29:50.969 --> 00:29:51.790]  That's what we're breaking down.
[00:29:53.464 --> 00:29:55.045]  And so, I'm going to do a free-for-all.
[00:29:55.745 --> 00:29:57.426]  Hell, you don't listen to me anyways, and I love you.
[00:29:58.047 --> 00:30:00.608]  You always say you're calling it on topic, make it about something else, that's fine.
[00:30:00.948 --> 00:30:12.114]  So any topic under the sun that you want to talk about, any question, any comment, you again disagree, you agree, whatever it is, we will get you on air.
[00:30:13.595 --> 00:30:16.477]  As long as you got a good clean phone line and make your points, I'd love to hear from you.
[00:30:17.492 --> 00:30:20.194]  So the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:30:20.214 --> 00:30:20.354]  877-789-Alex.
[00:30:20.374 --> 00:30:20.454]  877-789-2539.
[00:30:20.514 --> 00:30:23.297]  You notice I'm getting more back-to-calls in my routes.
[00:30:23.317 --> 00:30:25.198]  Guests are great as well.
[00:30:25.278 --> 00:30:26.760]  Got some big guests tomorrow.
[00:30:26.579 --> 00:30:32.019]  You notice I'm getting more back to calls in my roots.
[00:30:32.019 --> 00:30:33.019]  Guests are great as well.
[00:30:33.019 --> 00:30:34.019]  I've got some big guests tomorrow.
[00:30:34.019 --> 00:30:39.338]  I'm going to come in Saturday, 11 to 1 live.
[00:30:39.338 --> 00:30:42.299]  Because I've got a family event coming up after that.
[00:30:42.312 --> 00:30:44.192]  So I'm not going to do it later than I feel like I usually do.
[00:30:44.753 --> 00:30:56.657]  And I'm going to have Jay Dyer and his super smart, amazing, and also quite attractive wife, another great creation of God, in here with us on Saturday, 11 a.m.
[00:30:56.837 --> 00:31:00.599]  to 1 p.m., two hours commercial light.
[00:31:00.619 --> 00:31:01.399]  We'll have a few breaks.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:12.376]   With Jay Dyer and more on the New World Order, we're going to cover The Waterfront at 11 a.m.
[00:31:12.436 --> 00:31:13.457]  Central this Saturday.
[00:31:13.897 --> 00:31:17.601]  Then I will return Sunday 4 p.m.
[00:31:18.101 --> 00:31:23.101]  Central Standard Time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:23.101 --> 00:31:34.101]  Let me make a program note here before I go to break.
[00:31:34.412 --> 00:31:39.355]  And come back and hit the World Government News, the Poison Shot News, then take your calls, and then get back into the other news.
[00:31:39.815 --> 00:31:49.480]  Two big items from the Alex Jones and Free Speech Systems, Chapter 11, Subchapter 5, Bankruptcies, which are reorganizations, so we stay on air, not liquidation, we're not shutting down.
[00:31:51.201 --> 00:31:59.185]  We followed completely truthfully, to the best of our knowledge, with the federal court, and I had a little question on there, are you holding any property for anybody?
[00:31:59.205 --> 00:32:00.386]  And I went, well, no I'm not.
[00:32:01.957 --> 00:32:04.799]  But I asked around to people here at Free Speech and they said, yes you are!
[00:32:08.402 --> 00:32:23.973]  Sam Montoya and Owen Schroer were both arrested and charged for being at the Capitol on January 6th, and their lawyers respectively, because we have gun safes here, said, will you hold their couple guns for you?
[00:32:25.374 --> 00:32:31.095]   And we said, sure, we'll hold their guns while they're still, years later, Being put as a meat grinder for absolutely nothing.
[00:32:31.636 --> 00:32:32.397]  National News!
[00:32:32.477 --> 00:32:34.658]  Jones has got January 6th weapons!
[00:32:34.979 --> 00:32:39.262]  Yeah, because our reporters did that and they're here in a building with armed guards in a safe.
[00:32:40.003 --> 00:32:43.366]  We're not planning the overthrow of the government with their shotguns and handguns.
[00:32:45.037 --> 00:32:46.357]  Another big fake piece of info.
[00:32:46.718 --> 00:32:58.601]  I launched AlexJonesLive.com and planning for years to do a subscription service and another thing and they flipped out and went, oh my god, he's planning to leave InfoWars and his bankruptcy is fake and all this other stuff.
[00:32:58.621 --> 00:33:07.964]  When I told them in the show and I told all of you on the show, it's a new site separate from InfoWars with another company that I don't own or control and that's all there.
[00:33:07.984 --> 00:33:09.164]  So now they want to investigate that?
[00:33:09.184 --> 00:33:10.385]  Investigate it all you want.
[00:33:10.985 --> 00:33:16.796]  And I also went ahead and launched that thing I've been planning for years to show them I can do any show I want wherever I want.
[00:33:17.137 --> 00:33:19.802]  It's not bad if I want to, but I'm not leaving Free Speech Systems.
[00:33:20.002 --> 00:33:21.585]  But I got a bunch of offers and a bunch of deals.
[00:33:21.825 --> 00:33:23.248]  But the fact that I built a little studio...
[00:33:25.112 --> 00:33:26.232]  Outside this operation.
[00:33:26.272 --> 00:33:27.053]  Other folks own it.
[00:33:27.333 --> 00:33:27.974]  It's nothing.
[00:33:28.194 --> 00:33:31.777]  But it shows how they just are obsessed with us not having communication.
[00:33:32.157 --> 00:33:35.179]  Hey, just because the left did that, I've been cutting back on interviews.
[00:33:35.399 --> 00:33:36.620]  I got about a hundred requests a day.
[00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:39.002]  I'm gonna do a hundred interviews in the next month, okay?
[00:33:39.022 --> 00:33:40.143]  You won't shut those down either.
[00:33:41.804 --> 00:33:52.973]  So here's Joe Rogan now saying there's a world government of evil world leaders trying to enslave us and just like that he knows all about everything.
[00:33:53.854 --> 00:33:57.176]  Because his best buddy, Elon Musk, has now come out against world government.
[00:33:57.916 --> 00:33:58.876]  And that's okay.
[00:33:58.997 --> 00:34:02.238]  So many people on Twitter are like, look at Joe, he's being Alex Jones.
[00:34:02.258 --> 00:34:03.739]  He ought to support Alex more.
[00:34:03.759 --> 00:34:08.081]  He ought to, wow, hey, our mission is to get everybody else away.
[00:34:08.381 --> 00:34:12.123]  And then we've got to be glad when other prominent people fight the globalists.
[00:34:12.503 --> 00:34:13.884]  We're not territorializing this.
[00:34:13.944 --> 00:34:14.744]  It's wonderful.
[00:34:15.164 --> 00:34:15.665]  It's good.
[00:34:15.985 --> 00:34:26.822]   Here's Joe Rogan talking about Brian Stelter, who's now the mini-me Kind of a drink server, cocktail waitress for Klaus Schwab at the World Government Summit.
[00:34:27.642 --> 00:34:30.303]  Heard at the World Economic Forum, right?
[00:34:30.323 --> 00:34:32.363]  We heard the... Brian Stelter was there.
[00:34:32.683 --> 00:34:33.604]  Brian Stelter.
[00:34:33.704 --> 00:34:35.824]  Brian Stelter is now at the World Economic Forum.
[00:34:35.844 --> 00:34:37.305]  What can we do about these problems?
[00:34:39.846 --> 00:34:41.186]  He looked very comfortable there, didn't he?
[00:34:41.206 --> 00:34:41.946]  Of course he does.
[00:34:41.986 --> 00:34:45.367]  He's with evil lizard people that are trying to control the world.
[00:34:45.627 --> 00:34:46.548]  That's his bosses.
[00:34:46.588 --> 00:34:48.368]  He knows how to handle that kind of situation.
[00:34:48.388 --> 00:34:50.789]  I've been around these evil lizard people.
[00:34:52.684 --> 00:35:00.990]  He looked he looked as happy as maybe he's ever been well He's probably very excited just to be working again in any way shape or form.
[00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:04.412]  That's true You know and he's not a guy that really supposed to be in front of a camera, right?
[00:35:04.432 --> 00:35:22.324]   He's supposed to be a journalist, but he's not even good at that So he's what he's doing now is holding water for the evil leaders of the world who want to institute hate speech policies Nationwide and you know centralized digital currency and they want everybody to eat bugs and you will own nothing and be happy This is the people he's working Yeah.
[00:35:22.144 --> 00:35:27.363]   for now because he's basically a prostitute and you know they hired him
[00:35:27.363 --> 00:35:30.604]   to go over there and do that and he's like what can we do what can we do
[00:35:30.604 --> 00:35:34.684]   better what can we do different to get everybody to stand in line yeah can we
[00:35:34.684 --> 00:35:40.764]   do and and and for a journalist to sit there there was that one moment where
[00:35:40.764 --> 00:35:46.284]   that woman Vera Urela she's an EU official and she's talking about hate
[00:35:46.284 --> 00:35:50.163]   speech laws and then she touches the knee of somebody sitting next to her and
[00:35:50.163 --> 00:35:52.323]  saying, "You're going to have that in America soon."
[00:35:52.354 --> 00:36:03.578]  As hate speech, as illegal hate speech, which you will have soon also in the US, I think that... Yeah, and Brian Stelter is sitting there grinning, like...
[00:36:04.298 --> 00:36:05.881]  That's not offensive to him?
[00:36:05.901 --> 00:36:10.207]  You're a European basically saying, oh yeah, you're going to have this too soon.
[00:36:10.367 --> 00:36:15.374]  Even though it's completely antithetical to everything that we believe in in this country.
[00:36:15.514 --> 00:36:41.237]   Well, I think when you're working in a corporate news structure, and you can speak to this better than I could obviously, but I think when you're working in an environment where you have editors and people in your ear, and you have producers, and you have narratives that the company is pushing, and then you have sponsorships that you're beholden to, it's very difficult to form any sort of problematic or controversial independent thought and then try to express it publicly.
[00:36:41.397 --> 00:36:42.258]  You're not going to do it.
[00:36:42.418 --> 00:36:44.439]  It's just too scary and sketchy.
[00:36:44.939 --> 00:36:51.884]  So when you're trying to keep that job, and here's a guy like Brian Stelter who already lost one of the biggest gigs in all of broadcast news.
[00:36:51.924 --> 00:36:53.044]  He was on CNN.
[00:36:53.565 --> 00:36:57.848]  And then, you know, here he's standing there and they're saying, you're going to have hate speech laws in America too.
[00:36:57.868 --> 00:36:59.789]  He's like, okay, everything's running smooth.
[00:37:00.189 --> 00:37:00.870]  Everyone's smiling.
[00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:04.773]  He's not suitable for that role.
[00:37:05.513 --> 00:37:06.774]  He doesn't belong there.
[00:37:07.035 --> 00:37:13.160]  You don't have the stones to carry that conversation in a way that's going to benefit all these people that are listening to it.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:18.504]  What you want is someone who's in that position that goes, hold on, what do you think is hate speech?
[00:37:18.905 --> 00:37:20.006]  What's hate speech to you?
[00:37:20.346 --> 00:37:21.367]  And what's hate speech to me?
[00:37:21.407 --> 00:37:22.448]  And who gets to decide?
[00:37:22.856 --> 00:37:25.962]  Yeah, how is that going to be adjudicated?
[00:37:25.982 --> 00:37:26.984]  What's your definition of hate?
[00:37:27.064 --> 00:37:28.206]  What's your definition of speech?
[00:37:32.426 --> 00:37:38.349]  So they call it mainstream media, but it's really corporate dinosaur media with almost no viewers unless it's like the Super Bowl.
[00:37:38.649 --> 00:37:41.350]  So that's why they flood it with propaganda because it's the last place they have an audience.
[00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:43.151]  Joe Rogan is mainstream.
[00:37:43.811 --> 00:37:51.975]  Joe Rogan does have the biggest audience in the world, other than like some shows in China and India that are state-run that have like 100 million viewers.
[00:37:52.355 --> 00:37:56.937]  But when it comes to independent free media, Joe Rogan has 20 million, 30 million viewers a day.
[00:37:57.881 --> 00:38:00.883]  Per show, easily, he's mainstream.
[00:38:01.383 --> 00:38:04.125]  And the mainstream is rejecting the New World Order and their minions.
[00:38:04.145 --> 00:38:06.307]  See, that's what victory is.
[00:38:06.687 --> 00:38:16.074]  So let's recognize we're the majority, we're the cultural future, we're overturning the powerful elite, we're the avant-garde, we are the rebels, and we're winning.
[00:38:17.571 --> 00:38:20.454]  Let's play that clip I mentioned from yesterday of Elon Musk.
[00:38:20.914 --> 00:38:23.277]  He knows we're winning, so he's jumping to our side.
[00:38:23.878 --> 00:38:25.079]  That's pretty much what's happened.
[00:38:25.559 --> 00:38:26.781]  So don't be mad about it.
[00:38:26.841 --> 00:38:27.822]  Don't completely trust him.
[00:38:27.842 --> 00:38:28.763]  Don't turn your back on him.
[00:38:29.603 --> 00:38:30.885]  Don't turn the lights off around him.
[00:38:31.365 --> 00:38:35.550]  But at least he's coming to our side because we're winning.
[00:38:38.717 --> 00:38:48.700]  I know this is called the World Government Summit, but I think we should be maybe a little bit concerned about actually becoming too much of a single world government.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:39:01.564]  If I may say that we want to avoid creating a civilizational risk by having, frankly, this may sound a little odd, too much cooperation between governments.
[00:39:03.224 --> 00:39:46.204]   You know, if you look at, say, history and the rise and fall of civilizations, really all throughout history civilizations have risen and fallen, but it hasn't meant the doom of humanity as a whole, because there have been all these separate civilizations that were separated by great distances, and so You know, say like, while Rome was falling, Islam was rising, and so you had like... So what he's saying with the Founding Fathers is that it's why we have a federal and state government, that's separation, and three branches in the federal and state, for a separation of powers for checks and balances, or fire walls, or bulkheads in a ship.
[00:39:46.224 --> 00:39:59.828]   I'm not going to play the whole clip because it's long, but here's the WHO's Ted Rose about Proposed framework for a stronger architecture for global health security, which is a worldwide UN treaty to take over our bodies.
[00:40:00.488 --> 00:40:02.590]  Here's some of him hitting the panic button.
[00:40:04.452 --> 00:40:16.324]  With urbanization, habitat destruction, intensive agriculture and climate change, these risks are converging with unprecedented frequency and intensity.
[00:40:17.699 --> 00:40:31.088]  We owe it to those we have lost and those who will come after us to learn the lessons from this pandemic and make the changes that must be made to keep the world safer.
[00:40:32.601 --> 00:40:33.121]  W.H.O.
[00:40:33.521 --> 00:40:47.685]  has proposed a framework for a stronger architecture for global health security, including stronger governance, stronger financing, stronger systems and tools, and a stronger W.H.O.
[00:40:48.686 --> 00:41:00.349]  The international accord or agreement that countries are now negotiating will provide a much-needed framework for enhancing a shared response to shared threats.
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.561]  Okay, I can't listen to it anymore.
[00:41:02.621 --> 00:41:05.363]  So a total surveillance grid run by the UN over your government.
[00:41:05.863 --> 00:41:15.329]  Here's Ian Bremmer, president and founder of the Eurasia Group, claims one of the obstacles to achieving globalization and new order is nationalism.
[00:41:15.729 --> 00:41:19.111]  Gotta get rid of those nation states and make sure they follow the UN orders.
[00:41:19.653 --> 00:41:26.475]  We see that misalignment playing out and all of them are challenging globalization.
[00:41:26.936 --> 00:41:35.519]  They're all creating some of the crises that we see in our headlines around the world and in this region today.
[00:41:36.059 --> 00:41:41.101]  Is that those crises create the seeds of a new order.
[00:41:41.181 --> 00:41:45.382]  And that's all of this nationalism, all the protectionism we see around the world.
[00:41:45.722 --> 00:41:46.823]  My country's been doing it.
[00:41:47.932 --> 00:41:49.613]  Donald Trump said, America first!
[00:41:50.073 --> 00:41:53.835]  Now, that is not meant to appeal to people outside the US.
[00:41:54.235 --> 00:42:01.458]  It's globalization adrift, it's globalization constrained, but it's also globalization continuing.
[00:42:02.159 --> 00:42:04.520]  And I think that's really critical.
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:06.901]  A few takeaways from that?
[00:42:07.881 --> 00:42:12.824]  The EU will be politically stronger in a more challenging environment.
[00:42:13.815 --> 00:42:27.284]  Economically, and from a security perspective, you will see the EU with stronger energy policy, fiscal policy, health policy, defense policy, and tech policy than at any point since the EU was created.
[00:42:28.425 --> 00:42:29.665]  Because of these crises.
[00:42:30.486 --> 00:42:32.327]  Because of the geopolitical concerns.
[00:42:32.387 --> 00:42:33.328]  Because of the pandemic.
[00:42:33.508 --> 00:42:35.409]  Heck, because of Brexit.
[00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:37.871]  We see NATO stronger too.
[00:42:39.591 --> 00:42:43.900]  So they create the crises to consolidate power and control for their new order.
[00:42:44.381 --> 00:42:45.203]  We're going to go to break.
[00:42:45.543 --> 00:42:46.526]  I got more clips.
[00:42:47.489 --> 00:42:50.231]  And then we're going to go to your phone calls very, very soon in the next hour.
[00:42:51.051 --> 00:42:51.952]  All the folks that are holding.
[00:42:52.752 --> 00:42:55.674]  Please remember, nobody's doing a broadcast this hardcore.
[00:42:55.774 --> 00:42:57.595]  Nobody's got these amazing listeners and viewers.
[00:42:57.715 --> 00:42:57.975]  You.
[00:42:58.335 --> 00:43:00.296]  Nobody's got these incredible guests all in one spot.
[00:43:00.436 --> 00:43:01.397]  We need your support.
[00:43:01.797 --> 00:43:03.418]  This is a national, global treasure.
[00:43:03.478 --> 00:43:05.059]  Not me, this whole organization.
[00:43:05.099 --> 00:43:06.740]  So spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:08.101]  Pray for us because you're part of it.
[00:43:08.401 --> 00:43:09.061]  You're at the heart of it.
[00:43:09.281 --> 00:43:10.022]  And get products.

[00:43:12.262 --> 00:43:15.141]  Amazing supplements are our main product line.
[00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:20.101]   We're bringing back t-shirts and books and films soon, but we were in a cash bind, didn't have money to buy those.
[00:43:20.101 --> 00:43:23.422]   So we just focused on the key supplements, and we're barely in the black right now,
[00:43:23.422 --> 00:43:25.822]  but we're pulling out of where we were.
[00:43:25.822 --> 00:43:29.941]   Please go to Infowarsstore.com and get Ultimate Bone Broth Plus.

[00:43:47.293 --> 00:43:48.313]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:43:48.333 --> 00:43:48.814]  The nitric.

[00:44:02.392 --> 00:44:04.434]  All at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:44:04.454 --> 00:44:06.315]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:44:06.415 --> 00:44:07.215]  InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:44:07.035 --> 00:44:11.195]  or 888-253-3139.
[00:44:11.195 --> 00:44:12.794]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:44:12.794 --> 00:44:15.374]  (upbeat music)
[00:44:15.374 --> 00:44:17.954]  (upbeat music)
[00:44:17.954 --> 00:44:25.815]   If you go to onlinehealthnow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors
[00:44:25.815 --> 00:44:27.054]  at the wellness company.
[00:44:27.127 --> 00:44:30.969]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the company.
[00:44:31.009 --> 00:44:35.392]  I contribute like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[00:44:35.532 --> 00:44:40.335]  Far and away the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's Detoxification.
[00:44:40.675 --> 00:44:42.897]  Supplement that features natokinase.
[00:44:42.997 --> 00:44:45.119]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[00:44:45.339 --> 00:44:51.003]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[00:44:51.043 --> 00:44:51.804]  This is very important.
[00:44:51.824 --> 00:44:56.648]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[00:44:56.868 --> 00:44:58.329]  People are low with the spike protein.
[00:44:58.369 --> 00:44:59.210]  They don't feel well.
[00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:00.931]  This is a potential solution.
[00:45:01.031 --> 00:45:03.994]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[00:45:04.074 --> 00:45:06.856]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[00:45:06.996 --> 00:45:07.977]  Isn't it interesting?
[00:45:08.357 --> 00:45:14.239]  Natural substances, in a sense, combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
[00:45:14.439 --> 00:45:18.941]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support, and thank you for getting into that, because it's important.
[00:45:18.961 --> 00:45:20.581]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[00:45:21.342 --> 00:45:30.145]  The mind-control media has been spotlighting recent reports on UFOs being spotted and even shot down out of the sky.
[00:45:31.045 --> 00:45:39.472]  And many suspect it's laying the groundwork for the so-called fake alien invasion that has been reported on now for decades.
[00:45:40.192 --> 00:45:48.218]  A false flag event wherein the public is tricked into believing that aliens from outer space are invading the Earth.
[00:45:49.339 --> 00:45:56.504]  In his 1991 book, Behold a Pale Horse, William Cooper claimed that secret groups within the U.S.
[00:45:56.564 --> 00:46:07.252]  government have designed their own flying saucer technology and are planning to launch a staged alien invasion in order to create a one-world government.
[00:46:07.652 --> 00:46:09.613]  What I discovered was amazing.
[00:46:10.294 --> 00:46:29.339]   What I discovered, ladies and gentlemen, is that there has been a plan in existence Since about 1917, and probably before that, to create an artificial extraterrestrial threat to this earth in order to create a one world totalitarian socialist government.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:45.014]  Nazi scientist and former head of NASA, Wernher von Braun, reportedly told his assistant, Carol Rosen, that a fake alien invasion will be the final gambit of an ongoing plan to create a one-world government.
[00:46:45.414 --> 00:46:51.780]  And we have to prevent the weaponization of space because there is a lie being told to everyone.
[00:46:52.641 --> 00:46:57.923]  That the weaponization of space is now first being based upon the evil empire, the Russians.
[00:46:58.423 --> 00:47:02.465]  There are many enemies who set against whom we're going to build this space-based weapon system.
[00:47:02.925 --> 00:47:05.686]  The first of whom was the Russians, which was existing at that time.
[00:47:06.386 --> 00:47:07.526]  Then there would be terrorists.
[00:47:07.566 --> 00:47:09.387]  Then there would be third world countries.
[00:47:09.427 --> 00:47:12.468]  Now we call them rogue nations or nations of concern.
[00:47:13.308 --> 00:47:14.569]  Then there would be asteroids.
[00:47:15.229 --> 00:47:24.759]  And then he would repeat to me, over and over, and the last card, the last card, the last card would be the extraterrestrial threat.
[00:47:26.221 --> 00:47:35.391]  The fake alien invasion is only possible if there are advanced technologies being hidden from the public, capable of pulling it off.
[00:47:36.613 --> 00:47:38.895]  And there is plenty of evidence supporting this.
[00:47:39.615 --> 00:47:46.280]  From the stolen and censored work of Nikola Tesla, to that of John Hutchison, and thousands more.
[00:47:47.001 --> 00:47:53.746]  According to some sources, these technologies were discovered by back-engineering alien spacecraft.
[00:47:54.366 --> 00:47:59.270]  But the word alien implies extraterrestrial, not from this Earth.
[00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:09.946]  And that's the fake part, because humanity's historical record is replete with non-human species that ruled over mankind as gods.
[00:48:10.828 --> 00:48:13.853]  This story is the most prolific story on Earth.
[00:48:14.933 --> 00:48:27.299]  The Sumerian texts, officially the oldest written documents we have, describe a non-human species that created a unique species of human via genetic modification.
[00:48:28.239 --> 00:48:34.822]  These non-humans then began mating with human women and created a new race of giants.
[00:48:35.722 --> 00:48:43.468]  This story is prevalent throughout our entire historical record and is found in practically every religious scripture on Earth.
[00:48:44.188 --> 00:48:55.717]  Nearly every culture on this planet claims to have been created by a race of god-like reptilians, most often described as serpent gods or dragons.
[00:48:56.958 --> 00:49:11.040]  David Icke has compiled scores of personal accounts describing an interdimensional reptilian-like species that hides in the shadows by shape-shifting and taking possession of a human's body.
[00:49:13.736 --> 00:49:27.712]  William Bramley's book, Gods of Eden, provides a comprehensive history of a secret brotherhood that works as an intermediary for a reptilian-like species that has been manipulating mankind for millennia.
[00:49:28.903 --> 00:49:36.607]  And in all these ancient accounts, we not only read about these god-like species, we read about their flying ships.
[00:49:37.427 --> 00:49:40.388]  In the ancient Vedas, they are called Vimanas.
[00:49:40.908 --> 00:49:52.634]  These ancient Vimanas were described in great detail a hundred years ago in the Vaimanika Shastra and were believed to be found within hidden caves of the Himalayan mountains.
[00:49:53.621 --> 00:50:00.966]  Which is what likely compelled the Nazis to explore the Himalayas in search of the Aryan race in 1938.
[00:50:02.527 --> 00:50:08.571]  We are officially told that the Aryan race was a blonde-haired, blue-eyed breed of humans.
[00:50:09.111 --> 00:50:10.232]  But this is a lie.
[00:50:10.572 --> 00:50:16.490]   The Aryan race that the Nazis were interested in was the Aryan race of the ancient Vedas,
[00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:22.572]   an elusive non-human species. All right, we got loaded phone lines and a ton of news coming up.
[00:50:22.572 --> 00:50:28.012]  Man, the poison vaccine stack is mighty crazy.
[00:50:28.243 --> 00:50:35.529]  We've also got the chemicals in the water literally changing or manipulating the sexual characteristics and fertility of children, including in the womb.
[00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:36.510]  Big news on that.
[00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:40.394]  We're going to be covering it all interspersed your calls.
[00:50:40.434 --> 00:50:42.876]  But let's take a lot of your calls today, as I said we would.
[00:50:43.456 --> 00:50:46.219]  We're going to go in the order the calls are received.
[00:50:46.999 --> 00:50:49.441]  Yitz in Israel wants to talk about the bigger picture.
[00:50:49.501 --> 00:50:50.122]  Thanks for calling.
[00:50:51.385 --> 00:50:52.906]  Hey Alex, pleasure to be on the show.
[00:50:53.547 --> 00:50:55.268]  I'm calling from the Holy Land, and I'm a U.S.
[00:50:55.308 --> 00:50:56.249]  and Israeli citizen.
[00:50:56.989 --> 00:50:58.130]  So the comment is simple.
[00:50:58.210 --> 00:50:59.752]  It's really about peaceful revolution.
[00:51:00.492 --> 00:51:04.936]  Look, we know the world's in a daze, physically, mentally, financially, spiritually.
[00:51:04.956 --> 00:51:08.959]  The question is, how do we supercharge the message and wake up the world?
[00:51:08.979 --> 00:51:11.641]  A couple quick thoughts, a quick comment.
[00:51:12.461 --> 00:51:14.803]  And we all know it's only through peaceful revolution.
[00:51:15.484 --> 00:51:22.477]   So how do we get you and others that align with you and that follow in your footsteps To continue to win the fight.
[00:51:22.938 --> 00:51:25.899]  There's only one way, and it's really just to supercharge the message.
[00:51:25.959 --> 00:51:30.480]  So if you think about it, young people were always the ones who would usually lead the protests.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.121]  Remember in the 60s, if you may not remember, but I remember.
[00:51:33.621 --> 00:51:34.321]  And in the U.S.
[00:51:34.862 --> 00:51:43.585]  Nowadays, we have a bunch of brain-dead, social media-addicted young folks who don't know what it's like to protest peacefully face-to-face.
[00:51:44.525 --> 00:51:45.125]  And who's left?
[00:51:45.885 --> 00:51:47.466]  Those of us who understand the past.
[00:51:47.486 --> 00:51:49.967]  So how do we affect this change in the now?
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:53.322]  If you think back, you know, January 6th, that was a whole different scene.
[00:51:53.683 --> 00:51:57.666]  There were peaceful people, but there were mainly, from what I could see, older folks.
[00:51:58.387 --> 00:51:59.708]  How do we get to the young people?
[00:51:59.748 --> 00:52:00.749]  That's the big question.
[00:52:00.789 --> 00:52:01.970]  And then a quick thought for you.
[00:52:03.251 --> 00:52:05.853]  You guys need to have an international power hour.
[00:52:06.654 --> 00:52:09.937]  You know, maybe take international calls, maybe once a week for an hour.
[00:52:10.626 --> 00:52:19.050]  And I think if you do film again, maybe even if it's country-specific, you'll expand the message and you'll more effectively get... I totally agree with you, Yitz.
[00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:28.394]  We need, in fact we've said before, get foreign calls, but we should have at least once a week, an hour or two, where we take international calls only.
[00:52:28.434 --> 00:52:29.154]  That's a great idea.
[00:52:29.174 --> 00:52:36.397]  Yeah, and one other quick thought, and I know you know this, and you're a pretty humble guy, even though you're pretty strong.
[00:52:36.937 --> 00:52:38.898]  You're the leader of the peaceful revolution right now.
[00:52:39.485 --> 00:52:42.807]  We have to expand the message, and I think that's one way to do it.
[00:52:42.907 --> 00:52:47.650]  And in terms of bringing more income into the company, you've got to get your products kosher.
[00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:49.091]  You've got to get the products kosher.
[00:52:49.511 --> 00:52:50.532]  That's in a giant market.
[00:52:50.572 --> 00:52:51.693]  I'm not talking about the Jewish market.
[00:52:51.713 --> 00:52:53.854]  I'm talking about the giant Muslim market as well.
[00:52:54.315 --> 00:52:54.975]  So think about that.
[00:52:54.995 --> 00:52:55.896]  You'll bring in more money.
[00:52:55.956 --> 00:52:56.536]  No, you're right.
[00:52:56.696 --> 00:52:58.677]  Well, I think our products pretty much are kosher.
[00:52:58.697 --> 00:52:59.738]  We just didn't think to do that.
[00:52:59.758 --> 00:53:00.218]  But you're right.
[00:53:00.238 --> 00:53:00.819]  We need to do that.
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:05.722]  And let's get the word out to the young people, because that's where we're missing the boat.
[00:53:06.972 --> 00:53:08.693]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[00:53:09.133 --> 00:53:16.996]  You know, people talk about kosher, but it really is, Leviticus is a good idea, and it's all health laws that are common sense.
[00:53:18.636 --> 00:53:21.117]  Beyond kosher, we need non-GMO.
[00:53:21.217 --> 00:53:33.128]   We already have that, but we really need to, all of us, do that, because all the studies show it's so poisonous, it's so bad, and the Bible tells us Do not mix the seed.
[00:53:33.789 --> 00:53:35.109]  And boy are they mixing the seed.
[00:53:35.169 --> 00:53:37.430]  They are crossing animals with humans.
[00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:38.991]  They're just doing everything and it's so dangerous.
[00:53:40.492 --> 00:53:43.073]  But you mentioned international.
[00:53:43.473 --> 00:53:45.454]  Hey, the New World Order is attacking everybody.
[00:53:45.474 --> 00:53:47.515]  It doesn't matter where you live or where you are.
[00:53:49.048 --> 00:53:51.849]  And so we should have a focus on the international.
[00:53:51.849 --> 00:53:53.489]  We have a lot of foreign calls, it's great.
[00:53:53.489 --> 00:53:55.768]   But whatever's happening in Australia, whatever's happening in Israel,
[00:53:55.768 --> 00:53:58.849]   whatever's happening in Brazil, whatever's happening in the UK, Russia,
[00:53:58.849 --> 00:54:01.567]  it all affects you no matter where you are.
[00:54:01.567 --> 00:54:03.329]  This planet is so small, folks.
[00:54:03.329 --> 00:54:05.728]  Corey in Wyoming, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[00:54:05.728 --> 00:54:08.567]  Yes, hello, Alex.
[00:54:08.567 --> 00:54:09.407]  Yes, sir.
[00:54:09.407 --> 00:54:14.648]   I wanted to ask all the Info Warriors to do a simple three-minute thing,
[00:54:14.648 --> 00:54:21.288]   which is to go to their hospital board meetings and I did this, I was the only person
[00:54:21.288 --> 00:54:25.849]   in the public forum that spoke, so I think it's really easy to do,
[00:54:25.849 --> 00:54:30.208]  and simply ask for organic blood for transfusions.
[00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:50.159]  I spent my three minutes, I read the Twitter post that Greg Reese brought attention to of the baby Alex in Washington State that developed a blood clot from its knee to his heart and died in 12 days because he didn't get the blood transfusion that their parents had set up.
[00:54:50.951 --> 00:54:57.094]  Yeah, I've seen a bunch of those reports.
[00:54:57.174 --> 00:55:09.221]  In fact, in today's stack on the vaccines, the so-called vaccines, all over the world, they're creating dating services of the uninjected, people are demanding unvaxed blood, and that's going to be the next big business.
[00:55:09.701 --> 00:55:14.701]   is going to be untainted blood that doesn't have the HIV spike protein in it.
[00:55:14.701 --> 00:55:19.101]   So they test so-called blood for the HIV spike protein, but now they're having to pass it
[00:55:19.101 --> 00:55:22.501]   through saying, "Well, it's not really HIV, it's just a spike protein."
[00:55:22.501 --> 00:55:27.001]   We need to make this a big issue, and that alone will stop these poison shots.
[00:55:27.001 --> 00:55:30.900]   What you're saying is absolutely avant-garde and where the future's at.
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:31.900]  Yes.
[00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:36.141]   I mean, if you're driving on an interstate highway and you get in a car accident and
[00:55:36.141 --> 00:55:40.300]  you need blood at the hospital. It's a gamble.
[00:55:40.539 --> 00:55:49.186]  On my Rumble channel, Organic Humans, I have my video up, Demand Organic Blood for Transfusions, to kind of illustrate to everybody how easy it is.
[00:55:49.286 --> 00:55:53.169]  It's only three minutes, but it can make a large impact if everybody does it.
[00:55:53.189 --> 00:55:54.350]  Tell you what, I'll air it.
[00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:54.951]  I'll air it.
[00:55:55.251 --> 00:55:57.493]  That's on Rumble and the video's called Organic Humans.
[00:55:58.921 --> 00:56:03.185]  That's my channel and the video is called Demand Organic Blood for Transfusion.
[00:56:03.345 --> 00:56:05.888]  Absolutely, that is such a leverage point for us.
[00:56:06.248 --> 00:56:13.635]  Not just to help people, but to educate people and to create markets of clean seeds, clean blood, what I was just talking about with a caller from Israel.
[00:56:13.995 --> 00:56:14.916]  Amazing point, sir.
[00:56:14.976 --> 00:56:15.596]  Thank you, Corey.
[00:56:15.616 --> 00:56:16.497]  Guys, pull the video up.
[00:56:16.857 --> 00:56:17.238]  Thank you.
[00:56:17.598 --> 00:56:19.240]  Alex in California, you're on the air.
[00:56:20.841 --> 00:56:22.563]  Yeah, wow, I'm on the phone.
[00:56:22.703 --> 00:56:22.923]  Yes, sir.
[00:56:26.096 --> 00:56:28.938]  There's a distraction within a distraction within a distraction.
[00:56:29.658 --> 00:56:39.044]  The UFOs are a distraction from the COVID info and the Borg exploding, but COVID itself is a distraction of another distraction.
[00:56:40.766 --> 00:56:45.469]  If you look at COVID-19, there's a 75-year period from 2019 to 1944-1945, which is essentially the end of World War II.
[00:56:45.329 --> 00:56:53.709]   from 2019 to 1944 and 1945 which is essentially it's essentially the end of
[00:56:53.709 --> 00:57:00.748]   World War two. Are you still online? Yep, yep. Yeah, so the Vatican put a 75 year seal on
[00:57:00.748 --> 00:57:04.269]  records for 1945.
[00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:13.831]  So DW News did a documentary about it, where their researchers were actually only able to get one week of reading these documents, something like 20,000 documents.
[00:57:13.851 --> 00:57:16.553]  They're only allowed to read it for one week before it had to shut down.
[00:57:16.573 --> 00:57:17.634]  Okay, what are the documents?
[00:57:17.654 --> 00:57:18.355]  I'm not following you.
[00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:22.852]  It's it's documents related to the Holocaust and paperclip and everything like that.
[00:57:22.932 --> 00:57:24.954]  There was a 75 year seal on the records.
[00:57:25.454 --> 00:57:25.674]  Sure.
[00:57:26.235 --> 00:57:26.555]  Okay.
[00:57:27.275 --> 00:57:28.476]  That's just all I want to say.
[00:57:29.017 --> 00:57:33.901]  But this is a it's a big game a long picture also about space.
[00:57:34.161 --> 00:57:36.643]  There's a Soyuz the Soyuz leak.
[00:57:37.441 --> 00:57:39.802]  On the International Space Station, it happened like a month ago.
[00:57:39.822 --> 00:57:41.363]  I didn't see anyone cover it.
[00:57:41.403 --> 00:57:43.324]  To me, that was a sign that this war is real.
[00:57:43.865 --> 00:57:53.130]  It's not a... If you want to look at S-O-Y-U-Z, the Soyuz League, on the Russian module of the International Space Station... Sure, we know there's a big space war going on.
[00:57:55.501 --> 00:58:02.063]  Yeah, if you go to LiveUAMap.com, it shows, I don't know if you've been there, but it has a lot of information.
[00:58:02.083 --> 00:58:06.024]  It's like a military map, but it shows China is launching a lot of satellites right now.
[00:58:07.105 --> 00:58:08.145]  That's all I really got to say.
[00:58:08.165 --> 00:58:08.945]  Thank you for what you do.
[00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:09.865]  The fish oil is great.
[00:58:10.366 --> 00:58:10.886]  I've taken it.
[00:58:11.126 --> 00:58:12.686]  You have really good dreams on the fish oil.
[00:58:12.866 --> 00:58:13.186]  God bless.
[00:58:13.226 --> 00:58:13.607]  Have a good one.
[00:58:13.887 --> 00:58:14.447]  Absolutely.
[00:58:14.467 --> 00:58:16.888]  The fish oil is psychotropic when you sleep.
[00:58:17.648 --> 00:58:18.648]  Thank you so much, sir.
[00:58:18.728 --> 00:58:19.508]  Let's see another one.
[00:58:19.568 --> 00:58:21.229]  Vance, or Vince, in New York.
[00:58:21.249 --> 00:58:21.489]  Go ahead.
[00:58:23.885 --> 00:58:24.345]  Hey, Alex.
[00:58:24.706 --> 00:58:24.926]  Welcome.
[00:58:25.206 --> 00:58:25.647]  How are you?
[00:58:25.807 --> 00:58:25.987]  Good.
[00:58:26.487 --> 00:58:34.975]  Hey, Alex, you woke me up about 20 years ago with the 9-11 Road to Tyranny documentary.
[00:58:36.015 --> 00:58:50.028]  And I wanted to bring that up because I saw that on a local access television station and an elderly couple was going down there and showing your videos like once a week.
[00:58:50.088 --> 00:58:51.609]  And I happened to stumble across it.
[00:58:52.293 --> 00:58:55.974]  Going through the channels and I wanted to bring that up just to give everybody hope.
[00:58:56.694 --> 00:59:02.176]  Like take action, even if it's just a small action because you don't know who's going to stumble across it.
[00:59:03.277 --> 00:59:05.157]  And I watched that video.
[00:59:06.178 --> 00:59:12.560]  And I've been awake and telling everybody what's going on ever since, you know, handing out DVDs.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:16.921]  And, you know, contributing as much as much as I can.
[00:59:17.741 --> 00:59:22.304]   And so I just wanted to just Pass that on to the listeners, dude.
[00:59:22.444 --> 00:59:23.825]  Just do something.
[00:59:23.885 --> 00:59:24.285]  Don't hang up.
[00:59:24.305 --> 00:59:25.826]  I want you to be able to finish your point, Vince.
[00:59:26.306 --> 00:59:29.969]  But yes, everybody knows about throwing a rock into a pond.
[00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:32.591]  And it sends ripples out.
[00:59:33.071 --> 00:59:34.612]  But that's really what's happening here.
[00:59:34.633 --> 00:59:37.034]  You don't know what effect it's had.
[00:59:37.074 --> 00:59:39.156]  You don't know what it's done.
[00:59:39.216 --> 00:59:49.232]   Like I influenced, I talked to the makers of it, Deus Ex, that big video game in the early 2000s, and then that influenced Elon Musk, he said.
[00:59:49.952 --> 00:59:51.353]  So, I mean, you don't know.
[00:59:51.373 --> 00:59:53.994]  I remember I met a long time ago.
[00:59:56.275 --> 00:59:58.557]  Mike Judge, he said, you influence King of the Hill.
[00:59:59.437 --> 01:00:04.460]  I want to address something that our first caller gets brought up, then I'll go back to your phone calls.
[01:00:07.181 --> 01:00:16.032]   I have four children and Two of them are of driving age.
[01:00:16.732 --> 01:00:19.353]  The third one is about to be of driving age.
[01:00:19.513 --> 01:00:24.456]  And my son showed some interest in driving, but he had to be pushed a little.
[01:00:25.596 --> 01:00:31.799]  And then my eldest daughter, who's an incredible person, I wish she wanted to be public.
[01:00:31.819 --> 01:00:32.480]  She'd be on the show.
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.361]  She's so smart, so beautiful, so amazing.
[01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:36.282]  I was like Marilyn Monroe.
[01:00:40.462 --> 01:00:44.908]  Really kind of didn't want to drive and we pushed her to do it and and and finally she's 18.
[01:00:45.328 --> 01:00:48.452]  She finally got a driver's license a few months ago and now she loves it.
[01:00:50.274 --> 01:00:52.416]  And I tried to keep phones and computers away from them.
[01:00:52.557 --> 01:00:54.579]  By the time they hit 16 or so it's very hard.
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:59.084]  They get all the dopamine they need from the games and talking to their friends.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:07.207]  And I think Ubers are the way to go, and they just don't get, they're not learning the next skill for life, and so that's how they're extincting cars.
[01:01:07.688 --> 01:01:18.039]  It's not just creating systems that don't work, not just increasing gas prices, but training young people to not want to go out and do things in the world.
[01:01:19.707 --> 01:01:23.028]  And all the studies and actuaries and information show that.
[01:01:23.188 --> 01:01:27.490]  And so they made a big joke about it a few months ago when I said, calculators are really destroying our minds.
[01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:31.171]  Well, they admit no one knows basic reading, writing, and arithmetic now.
[01:01:31.211 --> 01:01:32.692]  They've dumbed the language down.
[01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:35.233]  This is a plan to basically make us obsolete.
[01:01:36.393 --> 01:01:38.374]  Just like 90% of us don't know how to farm.
[01:01:38.534 --> 01:01:40.735]  Well, think how that makes us totally controllable.
[01:01:42.042 --> 01:01:43.463]  So here's some headlines dealing with this.
[01:01:43.883 --> 01:01:48.024]  Millennials don't drive and here's why they aren't likely to start anytime soon.
[01:01:48.825 --> 01:01:50.565]  And the media celebrates that.
[01:01:52.006 --> 01:01:57.028]  The reasons why millennials aren't as car crazed as baby boomers and how self-driving cars fit in.
[01:01:57.088 --> 01:01:58.989]  Yeah, you don't need to know how to drive a car.
[01:01:59.029 --> 01:02:00.009]  A computer will do it for you.
[01:02:00.909 --> 01:02:02.910]  Millennials are right to kill the car.
[01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:06.732]  New York Post gets it right.
[01:02:06.772 --> 01:02:09.933]  Why lazy entitled millennials can't last 90 days at work.
[01:02:11.141 --> 01:02:15.706]  See why some millennials are lazy and entitled, yet they may be the most successful generation of our time.
[01:02:17.188 --> 01:02:18.189]  And it goes on from there.
[01:02:21.553 --> 01:02:25.778]  If you look at the spectrums, and there's big analysis and studies out there, we've covered them.
[01:02:27.682 --> 01:02:45.809]  The more liberal you are, the more urban you are, and the more you don't know how to change a filter in your house, the more you don't know how to mow your yard, the more you don't want to own anything, the more you just accept the system that's predatory and is cornering you and domesticating you.
[01:02:48.194 --> 01:02:50.515]  I know so many people that have never shot a gun.
[01:02:51.475 --> 01:02:53.036]  So many people never been in a fist fight.
[01:02:53.816 --> 01:02:55.536]  So many people don't know how to change a tire.
[01:02:56.236 --> 01:02:58.357]  So many people don't know how to unclog a toilet.
[01:02:59.097 --> 01:03:14.302]  So many people don't know how to fry eggs or cook a steak or... Not just an easy meal to make, they don't know the enjoyment of getting out a cookbook and learning and testing and how you're designed to do it and how fun it is to cook.
[01:03:15.883 --> 01:03:17.123]  Their idea is Uber Eats.
[01:03:18.666 --> 01:03:25.031]  But when you don't know how to grow food, or cook food, or fix the electricity, or screw in a light bulb, really what are you?
[01:03:25.792 --> 01:03:26.272]  Worthless.
[01:03:28.093 --> 01:03:37.121]  And the left celebrates how worthless they are, and they laugh and joke about people that do know how to do something.
[01:03:37.421 --> 01:03:38.562]  We're like aliens to them.
[01:03:38.842 --> 01:03:43.025]  And I love folks in New York, a lot of hard-working, great people in New York, in construction, you name it.
[01:03:43.405 --> 01:03:53.706]   But I can't tell you how many times in my life I'd be on a trip or wherever or somebody down here visiting and they'd say, yeah, I thought all you Texans rode to work in horses.
[01:03:56.368 --> 01:03:58.450]  And you know, that's the idea these people have.
[01:03:58.470 --> 01:04:18.062]   But I'll tell you, my family with horses and cows and pine tree logging operations and Christmas tree operations and Great vineyards.
[01:04:20.203 --> 01:04:39.108]  You take a domesticated leptis that's grown up their life in a high-rise, 500,000 foot apartment, and you take them to my family in East Texas, and there's not even a connection to these people.
[01:04:40.048 --> 01:04:46.590]  And they'd look at my cousins and my family, driving around on tractors and baling hay and doing all this, and go, look at them hillbillies!
[01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:49.751]  Meanwhile, those hillbillies are engineers.
[01:04:50.152 --> 01:04:52.633]  Those hillbillies have spent decades in the military.
[01:04:52.894 --> 01:04:55.275]  Those hillbillies have flown helicopters in combat.
[01:04:55.636 --> 01:04:59.218]  Those hillbillies know how to build your building you live in.
[01:04:59.458 --> 01:05:01.420]  Those hillbillies know how to run electricity.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:07.564]  Those hillbillies know how to kick your ass and shoot a gun and grow a garden.
[01:05:12.167 --> 01:05:17.271]  And those hillbillies can take you out in the woods and say, if you've got a sore throat, take that plant.
[01:05:18.493 --> 01:05:19.493]  That mushroom's edible.
[01:05:19.794 --> 01:05:20.634]  That mushroom's not.
[01:05:21.054 --> 01:05:23.815]  Look at this chicken of the forest.
[01:05:24.196 --> 01:05:27.617]  Particular yellow fungus that grows in the back of trees.
[01:05:28.077 --> 01:05:32.479]  You can slice off and cook up with some olive oil that tastes like chicken and is super good for you.
[01:05:32.799 --> 01:05:34.280]  Full of vitamin B12.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:40.023]  They think we're space aliens because we know how to skin a buck.
[01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:42.324]  We know how to run a trot line.
[01:05:43.519 --> 01:06:07.225]  And if we need to, we know how to open up a can of whoop-ass, and we know how to shoot bullseye at 400 yards, and we know how to blast a dub out of the air, and we know how to fix a tractor, and we know how to take care of our children when they're sick, and we know how to save money, and we know how to get on our knees to Jesus Christ.
[01:06:09.198 --> 01:06:18.706]  And I'll take my hillbilly people any day over the domesticated folks that live in these crime-filled urban hell holes.
[01:06:18.986 --> 01:06:22.489]  And I don't think of myself as elitist or better than them.
[01:06:22.509 --> 01:06:25.111]  I actually feel sorry for these people.
[01:06:26.392 --> 01:06:35.980]  And I feel sorry that I'm way more disconnected from the land than my grandfathers or my father and my children are more disconnected from me.
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.042]  And that is my failure.
[01:06:39.878 --> 01:06:40.798]  So what are we doing now?
[01:06:42.258 --> 01:06:44.099]  You'll see me sometimes take all three, four days.
[01:06:44.139 --> 01:06:44.699]  Where's Alex?
[01:06:47.239 --> 01:06:49.620]  I'm out there running a chainsaw, cutting down trees.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:54.161]  I'm planting Christmas trees that we sell.
[01:06:55.081 --> 01:06:56.061]  I'm feeding cows.
[01:06:56.381 --> 01:06:57.341]  I'm riding horses.
[01:06:59.422 --> 01:07:00.782]  I'm doing what I'm supposed to do.
[01:07:01.242 --> 01:07:05.283]  And I'm as high as a kite, without any drug, without anything.
[01:07:06.092 --> 01:07:11.976]  Gettin' up at 4.30 in the morning, cookin' breakfast for my family, and then at 6 a.m.
[01:07:11.996 --> 01:07:17.901]  when the sun comes up, when it's still dark, getting in a tractor and balin' hay.
[01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:21.263]  And then feedin' the cows.
[01:07:25.126 --> 01:07:28.308]  And then feedin' sugar cookies to the pony.
[01:07:30.189 --> 01:07:35.093]  And then at night, I'm sittin' around that bonfire, lookin' up at the stars deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:07:37.205 --> 01:07:38.466]  And that's what we're meant to do.
[01:07:38.506 --> 01:07:39.567]  That's what we're designed to do.
[01:07:39.927 --> 01:07:42.990]  And anybody that tries to take you out of that is a liar.
[01:07:45.052 --> 01:07:45.852]  And is a fraud.
[01:07:48.935 --> 01:07:51.757]  All my family have other incredible skills.
[01:07:52.178 --> 01:07:53.379]  How to run generators.
[01:07:53.839 --> 01:07:54.960]  How to fix trains.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.062]  How to do it all.
[01:07:58.463 --> 01:08:04.383]   And I look at that And I feel so sorry for people that are domesticated.
[01:08:04.903 --> 01:08:09.367]  And I tell you, the future is human, and we're going to defeat this new world order.
[01:08:09.688 --> 01:08:22.058]  We're going to come back with your phone calls across the board, on the other side, the coordinates of freedom, the enemy hopes you don't share, ourinfowars.com, newswars.com, bandodvideo, and more.
[01:08:22.579 --> 01:08:25.962]  We'll be back in just a few minutes with your phone calls.
[01:08:26.322 --> 01:08:26.903]  Stay with us.
[01:08:28.157 --> 01:08:30.338]  Alright, Adventure New York, you held over to make your point.
[01:08:30.858 --> 01:08:31.738]  Rocking to a pond.
[01:08:31.758 --> 01:08:32.739]  Go ahead.
[01:08:33.739 --> 01:08:44.483]  Yeah, I was listening to you, Alex, and I just wanted to add that, you know, here in America, we're so far removed from the rugged individualism that built this country.
[01:08:45.243 --> 01:08:48.444]  And I really would love to see us get back to that.
[01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:54.572]  I just think there's a lot of factors contributing to that.
[01:08:54.612 --> 01:08:58.856]  We have the whole fatherless epidemic in our country.
[01:08:58.916 --> 01:09:10.126]  Fathers, they're good for kicking their boys out of the house and getting them out there to do stuff and teaching them trades and just teaching them how to be a man.
[01:09:11.407 --> 01:09:20.037]  The whole single mom epidemic and fatherless epidemic that we've got in the country is just... The United States is the most fatherless country in the world.
[01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:23.261]  That's the globalist operation, their mission's almost complete.
[01:09:23.601 --> 01:09:25.083]  That's exactly what we're talking about, brother.
[01:09:27.842 --> 01:09:33.631]  I just wanted to say real quick, you know, I'm a practicer of MGTOW, which stands for Men Going Their Own Way.
[01:09:34.252 --> 01:09:41.464]  And that movement is really gaining traction in this country because men are getting destroyed in family court and divorce court.
[01:09:42.285 --> 01:09:46.307]  And, you know, Title IV-D and all this stuff.
[01:09:46.547 --> 01:09:48.588]  Oh, men are totally, admittedly targeted.
[01:09:48.628 --> 01:09:56.732]  I played Paul Ehrlich, top globalist, a few weeks ago saying, in 1970, we're going to target the men, we're going to destroy the men, that'll destroy the family.
[01:09:57.012 --> 01:09:58.693]  I mean, it is an admitted plan.
[01:10:00.473 --> 01:10:03.415]  Yeah, and it's really having an effect.
[01:10:03.975 --> 01:10:05.216]  We've got to raise awareness.
[01:10:05.256 --> 01:10:07.917]  We've got to get these laws changed in these courts.
[01:10:08.469 --> 01:10:13.469]   So that men aren't getting wrecked and becoming pay slaves and indentured servants.
[01:10:13.469 --> 01:10:15.188]  And it's starting to happen, brother.
[01:10:15.188 --> 01:10:16.188]  I appreciate your call.
[01:10:16.188 --> 01:10:17.189]  Great points.
[01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:21.029]  All right, next up is Resist Warrior or Reset Warrior.
[01:10:21.029 --> 01:10:22.708]  Sorry, you're on the air.
[01:10:22.708 --> 01:10:23.708]  Go ahead.
[01:10:23.708 --> 01:10:24.708]  All right.
[01:10:24.708 --> 01:10:29.307]   So you're prompt from yesterday about what does this all mean that these people are out
[01:10:29.307 --> 01:10:33.868]   in the open and they're admitting who they are and that they're in trouble.
[01:10:33.868 --> 01:10:39.628]   I think that it primarily means that if you look at two gladiators in a fight, one, their
[01:10:39.628 --> 01:10:40.948]  primary weapon is truth.
[01:10:41.816 --> 01:10:43.897]  Their primary weapon is deceit.
[01:10:44.538 --> 01:10:45.798]  And they can no longer deceive.
[01:10:46.399 --> 01:10:49.261]  So, you know, I feel like we've disarmed them.
[01:10:49.941 --> 01:11:01.427]   And now what we have to do is, which a lot of callers are coming in and saying, we have to now go and with the final blow, with the truth, Get these people, you know, to the end of their rope.
[01:11:01.447 --> 01:11:02.027]  I agree.
[01:11:02.067 --> 01:11:11.409]  How scared do you think they are that now it's mainline to say, I hate the new world order and global government and the new world order is running at all and mainline pundits are against it?
[01:11:11.729 --> 01:11:13.330]  I mean, the worm is turning.
[01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:16.591]  Yeah, I mean, they're definitely scared.
[01:11:16.751 --> 01:11:22.812]  And, you know, these people are ultimately people, you know, and they're conditioned to operate in secrecy.
[01:11:22.912 --> 01:11:27.140]   So now that they can no longer deny who they are, Yeah, just flopping.
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:34.402]  I mean, look at the clip that Harrison played this morning, the Pentagon official being like, oh, you know, I barely even got a degree in history.
[01:11:34.522 --> 01:11:40.523]  Like, you think a general or a Pentagon official would be their primary focus is history?
[01:11:40.663 --> 01:11:44.004]  Because, I mean, it's just, they're flopping.
[01:11:44.284 --> 01:11:45.104]  They're in trouble, man.
[01:11:46.325 --> 01:11:48.885]  I agree, but what are they going to do to try to stay in control?
[01:11:50.346 --> 01:11:50.786]  I don't know.
[01:11:50.806 --> 01:12:05.228]   I almost feel like some of the things we're seeing, these chemical train derailments, I mean, that I don't know any details on that Black Hawk downing in Arizona, but this systemic collapse, I mean, I think that that's already the start of it.
[01:12:06.208 --> 01:12:07.449]  So we're seeing them flailing.
[01:12:07.469 --> 01:12:10.270]  I can't say, I don't know how bad it's going to get.
[01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:16.253]  I mean, I know how much we talk about nuclear war on this show, but I just, we're going to have to see.
[01:12:16.273 --> 01:12:17.914]  We're just going to have to keep pushing with the truth.
[01:12:18.014 --> 01:12:18.674]  No, you're right.
[01:12:18.694 --> 01:12:19.394]  You can feel it.
[01:12:19.414 --> 01:12:20.054]  You can see it.
[01:12:20.094 --> 01:12:20.975]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[01:12:21.395 --> 01:12:23.056]  Steve in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:12:24.195 --> 01:12:28.018]  God bless you brother and your family and the InfoWars crew.
[01:12:29.379 --> 01:12:31.320]  If I got time, I want to make two points.
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.802]  One on the war, but mainly on the shots.
[01:12:35.003 --> 01:12:43.129]  The poison shots, they are definitely, in my opinion, the number one crime of the century.
[01:12:43.689 --> 01:12:44.249]  I mean, I agree.
[01:12:44.289 --> 01:12:46.871]  And it's not just this current attack that's so horrible.
[01:12:46.931 --> 01:12:48.733]  Millions dead, tens of millions sick.
[01:12:49.113 --> 01:12:50.594]  It's the takeover of our bodies.
[01:12:51.855 --> 01:12:52.255]  Correct.
[01:12:54.073 --> 01:13:01.456]  It's ongoing, and it's a constant war that we are at battle with the globalists.
[01:13:02.136 --> 01:13:17.682]  But one point that I wanted to bring up was Dr. Mercola, a couple days ago on his website, he released the article, and there's the United States National Center for Health Statistics, the NCHS.
[01:13:18.782 --> 01:13:26.382]   And now what they're doing is they have created a code, it's called ICD-10 code,
[01:13:26.382 --> 01:13:31.282]   and that is being used by all of our primary care physicians
[01:13:31.282 --> 01:13:36.621]   when you go to the doctors, and they're reporting using this code
[01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:38.702]  everybody that is unvaxxed.
[01:13:38.702 --> 01:13:40.702]  Yes, I saw that in the news a month ago.
[01:13:40.244 --> 01:13:44.826]  An illegal database who's not taking the poison shot, then they discriminate against people.
[01:13:45.346 --> 01:13:48.868]  Rand Paul's introduced a bill to outlaw that, but that is just outrageous.
[01:13:49.368 --> 01:13:52.189]  Total Nuremberg violation, absolute criminal activity.
[01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:58.853]  Yes, and they're going to try to use it to bring in the digital passports and the digital IDs, of course.
[01:13:59.673 --> 01:14:09.671]   And the reason I bring that up, and I wanted to make a quick point about the war, because I'm like a lot of other callers, and you and everybody else, No, they're not going to stop.
[01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:15.430]   nuclear war like dr. Boyle said we're like 15 seconds away and Colonel
[01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:20.350]   McGregor he did an interview I can't remember but I watched it the other day
[01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:28.350]   and he was talking about how Ukraine they're going to be his words were
[01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:33.010]   annihilated no matter how bad the Russians get hit no matter how many
[01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:39.689]   tanks no they're not going to stop the Russians never stop no sir they're not
[01:14:39.689 --> 01:14:44.970]   you know these are the things that freak me out more than anything about the war
[01:14:45.218 --> 01:15:00.522]  And, you know, when you've got Putin saying, look, I'm not at war with the American people, I'm not at war with the people in Europe, he even says, Putin, I'm at war with the New World Order globalists.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.781]  Which is true, and they're having meetings announcing it.
[01:15:05.241 --> 01:15:05.861]  Thank you for the call.
[01:15:05.921 --> 01:15:06.601]  Great point, sir.
[01:15:07.001 --> 01:15:09.842]  We've got some breaking news I'm going to hit when the next segment starts.
[01:15:10.362 --> 01:15:13.123]  There's been a new massive train derailment in Michigan.
[01:15:14.063 --> 01:15:14.863]  A chemical train.
[01:15:15.483 --> 01:15:17.104]  And reports are it's already smoking.
[01:15:17.664 --> 01:15:20.785]  We're going to cover that coming up next segment as I'm giving the articles.
[01:15:21.545 --> 01:15:24.125]  But let's go back to your calls.
[01:15:24.605 --> 01:15:25.626]  Robert in Thailand.
[01:15:25.646 --> 01:15:26.166]  You're on the air.
[01:15:26.206 --> 01:15:26.446]  Go ahead.
[01:15:28.328 --> 01:15:28.968]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:30.710]  I wanted to get back to you about the X3.
[01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:32.571]  You asked me to give you an update on that.
[01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:34.952]  I got it out here in Thailand, received it really well.
[01:15:34.992 --> 01:15:36.213]  Thank you guys for sending that out here.
[01:15:36.913 --> 01:15:39.435]  It had a huge effect with my biohacking plugged right in.
[01:15:39.475 --> 01:15:42.077]  I felt amazing getting some more ASAP.
[01:15:43.077 --> 01:15:49.521]  I wanted to thank you for being one of the two biggest influences in my life as a freedom fighter.
[01:15:49.841 --> 01:15:57.663]   You and Rick Simpson were the two people who set me on the path to be a freedom fighter and spread the truth. The Rick Simpson
[01:15:57.663 --> 01:16:03.553]   story, Run From the Cure, is a huge, you know, the previous caller said COVID crime
[01:16:03.553 --> 01:16:07.963]   is the biggest, but this actually is bigger than the COVID crime because knowledge of the endocannabinoid
[01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:12.483]   system would save tens of millions of lives from cancer. There is no doubt in
[01:16:12.483 --> 01:16:18.954]   thousands of studies that remove the THC that gets you quote high, that what is in CBD and what is
[01:16:18.954 --> 01:16:25.003]   in the plant is the most magic plant God gave us and what it does for people that have epilepsy and
[01:16:25.003 --> 01:16:28.284]   narcolepsy and all these other neurological disorders.
[01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:37.356]  I mean, people have seen the videos where somebody that has serious Parkinson's, an hour after taking a high-powered CBD is having no tremors.
[01:16:37.496 --> 01:16:38.457]  I mean, it's incredible!
[01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:41.142]  It's fast acting.
[01:16:41.163 --> 01:16:42.243]  You can see it in the videos.
[01:16:42.263 --> 01:16:43.224]  You can see the studies.
[01:16:43.244 --> 01:16:44.504]  There's a lot of it in history.
[01:16:44.584 --> 01:16:46.185]  Run from the Cure is the documentary.
[01:16:46.205 --> 01:16:48.086]  I recommend people duck, duck, go check that out.
[01:16:48.326 --> 01:16:51.388]  Rick Simpson would be a great guest if you'd ever be willing to have him on.
[01:16:51.408 --> 01:16:51.848]  I'll get him on.
[01:16:51.888 --> 01:16:53.589]  Yeah, I'm familiar with the work.
[01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:54.369]  We'll get him on.
[01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:56.410]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:16:57.091 --> 01:16:57.471]  Thank you.
[01:16:57.491 --> 01:17:03.094]  Yeah, we sell high-end, highest quality CBD oil at about half off what you buy at stores.
[01:17:04.008 --> 01:17:10.510]  And we've had outside groups test it and say, oh my God, you're selling the highest quality, full spectrum CBD, 1000 milligram, 25 milligram, and 10 milligram.
[01:17:11.190 --> 01:17:12.291]  And yeah, it's there.
[01:17:12.971 --> 01:17:14.471]  And people take it, it blows them away.
[01:17:14.491 --> 01:17:17.392]  It's at infowarestore.com and Sports and Broadcast.
[01:17:17.412 --> 01:17:18.473]  You're crazy if you don't get it.
[01:17:18.753 --> 01:17:20.273]  Especially for joint pain, you name it.
[01:17:20.893 --> 01:17:24.234]  I take it almost every day because I never got my Achilles fixed.
[01:17:24.294 --> 01:17:25.155]  I have no Achilles.
[01:17:25.635 --> 01:17:26.695]  And it's painful as hell.
[01:17:26.755 --> 01:17:27.535]  I'm like, I don't take this.
[01:17:27.595 --> 01:17:27.975]  I feel it.
[01:17:28.296 --> 01:17:28.896]  We'll be right back.
[01:17:28.916 --> 01:17:29.296]  Stay with us.
[01:17:30.458 --> 01:17:37.720]  Well, I've seen different statistics, but we've got basically a 3,000% increase in infrastructure breakdown in the last two years.
[01:17:38.341 --> 01:17:44.663]  Power stations, food processing centers, train derailments, chemical plant fires, oil plant fires.
[01:17:45.103 --> 01:17:46.203]  You don't need me to tell you about it.
[01:17:46.263 --> 01:17:47.384]  You can see it every day.
[01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:53.166]  And now, the sixth derailment in the last 30 days.
[01:17:54.488 --> 01:18:00.933]  The fourth in two weeks, train derails outside Detroit, Michigan with one car carrying hazardous materials.
[01:18:00.993 --> 01:18:09.840]  Fox News reports a train containing one car of hazardous materials has derailed Thursday in Van Buren Township outside Detroit, Michigan.
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:13.863]  Reports say the cause of the derailment was not immediately clear.
[01:18:13.903 --> 01:18:16.505]  There was a big derailment outside Chicago yesterday.
[01:18:17.085 --> 01:18:21.669]  A train containing one car of hazardous materials has derailed in Van Buren Township.
[01:18:22.233 --> 01:18:24.034]  The cause of the derailment was not immediately clear.
[01:18:24.054 --> 01:18:26.876]  Authorities responded to the train derailment at Van Buren Township in Detroit.
[01:18:27.316 --> 01:18:39.864]  Officials that spoke to WXYZ, I'm not joking, that's a TV station, WXYZ, which reported that at least six cars were seen off the tracks, said one of them was carrying hazardous materials.
[01:18:40.424 --> 01:18:43.166]  We'll continue to cover that as it unfolds.
[01:18:44.639 --> 01:18:56.225]  We are taking your phone calls right now, but more important than going to InfoWarsStore.com and getting great products you need to fund the operation that enrich us all and empower us all, is spreading the word.

[01:19:05.923 --> 01:19:07.324]  People are ready to be waken up.
[01:19:07.685 --> 01:19:10.627]  People are ready for the truth, but it's only you that can carry the ball.
[01:19:11.187 --> 01:19:12.889]  Let's talk to John in Mexico.
[01:19:12.949 --> 01:19:13.889]  Thanks for holding, John.
[01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:18.373]  You are a veteran, confronted mayor of Houston.
[01:19:18.393 --> 01:19:21.996]  That's what the headline, that's what the piece of information you gave us.
[01:19:22.416 --> 01:19:23.317]  What are you talking about, John?
[01:19:24.369 --> 01:19:26.171]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:19:26.211 --> 01:19:26.791]  How you doing?
[01:19:26.951 --> 01:19:29.673]  I just wanted to start by saying it's an honor being a part of your show.
[01:19:30.214 --> 01:19:32.115]  I've been watching you about 10, 15 years.
[01:19:32.155 --> 01:19:35.058]  I really do appreciate all the knowledge that you put out.
[01:19:35.238 --> 01:19:38.260]  And I wanted to also say true rest in peace to my grandfather.
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:39.361]  He passed away this morning.
[01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:40.943]  I just got word about an hour ago.
[01:19:41.603 --> 01:19:42.764]  Say his name.
[01:19:42.804 --> 01:19:44.465]  Let's give him a good send-off here.
[01:19:45.787 --> 01:19:47.368]  Oh, his name is Beaufort Horn.
[01:19:48.348 --> 01:19:49.529]  Yeah, he was a badass.
[01:19:49.549 --> 01:19:49.950]  He was bad.
[01:19:50.050 --> 01:19:51.171]  90 years, he was a badass.
[01:19:51.211 --> 01:19:53.013]  But he reminds me so much of you.
[01:19:52.833 --> 01:19:55.833]  Beautiful one. Appreciate that. Man, that's a cool name.
[01:19:55.833 --> 01:20:02.012]   That sounds like a badass Yeah, he was a badass. He was bad 90 years. He was a badass
[01:20:02.012 --> 01:20:08.473]   But he reminds me so much of you as you know right now, I'm in Mexico and
[01:20:08.473 --> 01:20:15.552]   I've been going through a lot. But what we're doing now is I'm about to run for the mayor of Houston
[01:20:15.604 --> 01:20:17.486]  So I'll be back in, uh, Texas.
[01:20:17.586 --> 01:20:27.553]  I'm from Dallas, but I'll be back in Texas, uh, next week to run for the mayor of Houston because, uh, it's a big coverup going on in Houston right now.
[01:20:28.314 --> 01:20:31.456]  And what happened was, uh, they compared me to you.
[01:20:31.497 --> 01:20:33.898]  They was calling me the black Alex Jones on YouTube.
[01:20:33.938 --> 01:20:34.299]  Wait a minute.
[01:20:34.339 --> 01:20:34.939]  I saw that.
[01:20:35.019 --> 01:20:35.640]  That's you.
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:36.921]  I saw that a couple months ago.
[01:20:37.884 --> 01:20:38.824]  Yeah, yeah, that's me.
[01:20:39.324 --> 01:20:39.744]  That's me.
[01:20:40.225 --> 01:20:42.825]  Oh, I told my producers to get you on as a guest.
[01:20:42.865 --> 01:20:43.765]  I guess they couldn't get a hold of you.
[01:20:44.265 --> 01:20:44.966]  I forget your name.
[01:20:45.006 --> 01:20:45.426]  What's your name?
[01:20:45.446 --> 01:20:45.986]  We'll pull it up.
[01:20:46.046 --> 01:20:50.887]  If you type in the Black Alex Jones of Houston, I forget what you were talking about.
[01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:52.927]  Was it a shooting or something?
[01:20:53.327 --> 01:20:53.948]  Or crime?
[01:20:53.968 --> 01:20:55.768]  Yeah, it was a shooting.
[01:20:55.948 --> 01:20:57.028]  It was a shooting that happened.
[01:20:57.568 --> 01:21:00.369]  And what happened was the mayor covered it up.
[01:21:01.087 --> 01:21:23.474]  And I showed up at the mayor, he had a Tuesday morning meeting, so I flew from Mexico to Houston, showed up at the meeting, and I confronted him with the recording of the chief senator, his wife, saying that if y'all want to know who can't take off, get Sylvester on the phone, I'll tell y'all who can't take off if you get the mayor on the phone.
[01:21:23.934 --> 01:21:26.895]  And when I showed up and showed that, you know, they wanted to arrest me.
[01:21:26.935 --> 01:21:29.916]  Well, folks that know the backstory, tell them what happened with the shooting.
[01:21:31.437 --> 01:21:43.566]  Well, what happened was, Takeoff was at a dice game with Jay Prince's son in Houston, Texas, and he got shot.
[01:21:43.586 --> 01:21:46.968]  They tried to say it was friendly fire, but it was more involved.
[01:21:47.048 --> 01:21:48.609]  They took his chain and all that.
[01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:58.176]  So what we did was, we have a page on YouTube called Paperwork Party, and we actually solved the murder, but the bad thing about it is, is the mayor was involved.
[01:21:58.877 --> 01:22:00.218]  So we had to confront him.
[01:22:01.019 --> 01:22:03.060]  And why do they call you the Black Alex Jones?
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:04.001]  I remember watching the video.
[01:22:04.021 --> 01:22:04.782]  You were in their face.
[01:22:05.922 --> 01:22:11.326]  Yeah, well the reason they call me the Black Alex Jones is because I've had three YouTube pages.
[01:22:11.566 --> 01:22:14.348]  Every last one of my YouTube pages has been demonetized.
[01:22:15.068 --> 01:22:17.049]  And I keep coming back.
[01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.990]  I keep coming back.
[01:22:18.450 --> 01:22:19.931]  I've been drugged through federal court.
[01:22:20.091 --> 01:22:25.435]  I just beat a federal case against an attorney in Houston, Texas called Dennis Sperling.
[01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:30.432]  He had something to do with the murder of Kevin Samuels on the paperwork party.
[01:22:30.472 --> 01:22:39.677]  We had a paperwork party show on YouTube, and we pulled the paperwork from the medical examiners, and the woman that was in the apartment was the woman that he sent.
[01:22:39.817 --> 01:22:43.959]  And we revealed it on the show, and we tried to talk to the mayor of Atlanta about that.
[01:22:44.319 --> 01:22:44.939]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:46.000]  What they did, they sued me.
[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:47.121]  They came after me hard.
[01:22:47.141 --> 01:22:47.841]  I'm talking about Alex.
[01:22:49.153 --> 01:22:51.954]  That's why they called me the Black Alex Jones because I beat that case.
[01:22:52.354 --> 01:22:56.615]  But they came after me hard, hard, hard.
[01:22:56.675 --> 01:22:58.115]  Well, sir, we'll get your info.
[01:22:58.135 --> 01:22:59.336]  Then I'll have to go back and look at the case.
[01:22:59.396 --> 01:23:00.356]  I remember seeing it in the news.
[01:23:00.736 --> 01:23:01.996]  But I appreciate you calling us, sir.
[01:23:02.036 --> 01:23:02.577]  God bless you.
[01:23:02.937 --> 01:23:03.197]  Wow.
[01:23:04.217 --> 01:23:05.217]  See, I'm following this stuff.
[01:23:06.177 --> 01:23:07.418]  Beverly in California.
[01:23:07.438 --> 01:23:07.918]  You're on the air.
[01:23:07.938 --> 01:23:08.278]  Go ahead.
[01:23:09.912 --> 01:23:22.241]  Hey Alex, you woke me up in 2007 with Endgame when I was about 19, and since then I've always wanted to be a prepper, but I was a little too busy being young and dumb.
[01:23:22.962 --> 01:23:37.233]  So I'm 35 now, a little bit smarter, and I wanted to give out my telegram handle, which is tankgirl24, and see if there are any InfoWarrior preppers who need people to work the land.
[01:23:37.493 --> 01:23:38.634]  Please get in touch with me.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:45.383]  And also, I'm not sure if this already exists, but have you thought about an InfoWars social network?
[01:23:46.003 --> 01:23:48.685]  You know, we tried to do it and we just got hacked and attacked.
[01:23:48.705 --> 01:24:00.530]  We don't have the money to build one that doesn't get shut down because they're very easy to manipulate and attack from different angles and shut down both cyber attacks but also infiltrators that get on and do a bunch of bad stuff.
[01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:06.313]  But yes, the whole future is going to be awake humans getting together and moving to the countryside together.
[01:24:06.673 --> 01:24:15.311]   And what you're saying is about Farmers and ranchers and people trying to hire outside folks come in and train them to actually build new communities.
[01:24:15.351 --> 01:24:16.152]  That's going to be the future.
[01:24:17.733 --> 01:24:22.815]  I think exposing the agenda is as much of a threat as networking and coming together.
[01:24:22.835 --> 01:24:27.038]  No, I hear you.
[01:24:27.058 --> 01:24:28.158]  We're trying to expose the threat.
[01:24:29.719 --> 01:24:30.239]  Exactly.
[01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:36.563]  They censor us and they keep us from communicating with each other because that's how we spread more information.
[01:24:38.061 --> 01:24:39.242]  I appreciate your call, Beverly.
[01:24:39.302 --> 01:24:40.684]  Kaylee in Arizona, go ahead.
[01:24:42.105 --> 01:24:43.246]  Oh my, can you hear me Alex?
[01:24:43.306 --> 01:24:44.287]  I can, thanks for calling.
[01:24:44.908 --> 01:24:45.929]  Thank you so much.
[01:24:45.969 --> 01:24:49.833]  I just want to start off and say thank you for your service and everything that you do.
[01:24:50.013 --> 01:24:52.375]  I've been listening to you since I was 18 years old.
[01:24:52.756 --> 01:24:54.257]  I'll be 26 next month.
[01:24:55.338 --> 01:24:56.539]  My boyfriend always teases me.
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:59.342]  He calls me a little Alexa Jones, but I'm fired up.
[01:24:59.763 --> 01:25:00.764]  I'm awake, you know?
[01:25:01.304 --> 01:25:05.747]  And I just wanted to share with you some information I saw this morning and see what you think about it.
[01:25:06.427 --> 01:25:24.277]  It was a video filmed in Ohio and it's dated Wednesday, 2-15-2023 and there's about 20 hazardous trucks, you know those like metal tank trucks, driving into a town in Ohio labeled with 3082, a hazardous chemical label.
[01:25:25.057 --> 01:25:30.721]  The woman that recorded the video asked one of the drivers, hey, what is in there?
[01:25:30.881 --> 01:25:32.041]  And he said water.
[01:25:32.482 --> 01:25:38.486]  Well, I did my research on what 3082 is, and you can too, and all the comments obviously went into detail about it.
[01:25:39.026 --> 01:25:47.211]  It's nickel oxide, and supposedly it's an emission catalyst, but I wanted to get your opinion on this, Alex.
[01:25:47.251 --> 01:25:47.791]  What do you think?
[01:25:47.871 --> 01:25:53.355]  Yeah, I'm not a chemist, so I don't know, but it sounds like they're wanting to burn up what's left because they don't want to get into the water supply.
[01:25:54.432 --> 01:25:54.672]  Right.
[01:25:54.932 --> 01:25:57.274]  Or, how do you feel about the water supply?
[01:25:58.135 --> 01:26:01.397]  Well, are you saying that this chemical is an accelerant?
[01:26:01.457 --> 01:26:02.017]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:26:02.057 --> 01:26:02.678]  I'm not a chemist.
[01:26:03.699 --> 01:26:08.202]  So, nickel oxide is supposed to be an emission catalyst, and it's obviously a carcinogen.
[01:26:08.242 --> 01:26:09.122]  Not healthy for us.
[01:26:09.162 --> 01:26:12.785]  But, I mean, I guess you think they're just going to dump it over the site.
[01:26:12.805 --> 01:26:14.486]  So you call it an ignition catalyst.
[01:26:14.566 --> 01:26:16.047]  I mean, that would be an accelerant, right?
[01:26:16.548 --> 01:26:17.128]  Yeah, right.
[01:26:17.308 --> 01:26:17.688]  Correct.
[01:26:18.009 --> 01:26:20.711]  I'm just a little concerned about this, because obviously...
[01:26:21.311 --> 01:26:22.972]  Their default was to say no problem.
[01:26:23.012 --> 01:26:24.253]  Now they're admitting it's really dangerous.
[01:26:24.613 --> 01:26:26.575]  Almost all the animals in the area are dying.
[01:26:26.955 --> 01:26:28.496]  And it's just default for them to cover it up.
[01:26:28.536 --> 01:26:29.096]  So I agree with you.
[01:26:29.116 --> 01:26:29.877]  We should all be watching it.
[01:26:30.177 --> 01:26:31.078]  I did not know about that.
[01:26:31.098 --> 01:26:32.899]  Can you, can I put you on hold?
[01:26:32.919 --> 01:26:34.080]  Can you tell the crew where you found that?
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.201]  And we'll pull it up?
[01:26:35.921 --> 01:26:36.922]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:36.942 --> 01:26:37.542]  All right.
[01:26:37.562 --> 01:26:38.283]  Thank you, Kaylee.
[01:26:38.303 --> 01:26:38.943]  Appreciate your call.
[01:26:39.824 --> 01:26:42.546]  Since you talk about chemicals in the water, here's what's going to happen.
[01:26:43.426 --> 01:26:45.368]  I've got that stack of news right here.
[01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:48.030]  So we're going to go to break.
[01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:49.611]  We're going to come back.
[01:26:51.209 --> 01:27:03.952]  And I'm going to get to that stack of news I have prepared today, then we'll take more calls, and then we'll get into the incredible vaccine news that is just insane.
[01:27:05.652 --> 01:27:07.912]  I can't say it's the biggest news ever because we kind of peaked out here.
[01:27:07.932 --> 01:27:14.414]  I mean, it's childhood heart attacks, you know, strokes, death, it doesn't help you, erases your immune system, gives you AIDS.
[01:27:14.474 --> 01:27:16.734]  I mean, it's just like, it's totally insane.
[01:27:16.754 --> 01:27:18.194]  But this stack is insane.
[01:27:18.795 --> 01:27:20.695]  But first, let me come back.
[01:27:23.018 --> 01:27:26.330]  They admitted major studies that chemicals are feminizing our boys.
[01:27:26.511 --> 01:27:27.511]  Stay with us.
[01:27:27.511 --> 01:27:41.511]  [Music]

[01:28:50.291 --> 01:28:51.473]  From the old German.
[01:28:52.233 --> 01:28:53.435]  From the old Norse.
[01:28:53.775 --> 01:28:55.775]  [Groaning]
[01:28:55.775 --> 01:28:57.775]  [Screaming]
[01:28:57.775 --> 01:28:59.775]  [Explosion]
[01:28:59.775 --> 01:29:01.775]  [Explosion]
[01:29:01.775 --> 01:29:05.775]  Chinese spy balloons consistently flying over the US.
[01:29:05.936 --> 01:29:10.298]  as green lasers from Chinese satellites are spotted over Hawaii.
[01:29:10.639 --> 01:29:13.220]  Food production facilities up in flames.
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:15.242]  Egg production sabotaged.
[01:29:15.502 --> 01:29:18.544]  Fuel pipelines causing statewide emergencies.
[01:29:18.864 --> 01:29:20.205]  Power grids attacked.
[01:29:20.585 --> 01:29:27.269]  All of these multiplying and alarming occurrences consistently relegated to independent reporting.
[01:29:27.369 --> 01:29:28.993]  Boy, next they'll be coming for the water.
[01:29:29.153 --> 01:29:29.995]  Oh wait, they are!
[01:29:30.295 --> 01:29:37.611]  Less than a month into the Biden administration was also a highly sophisticated attack on the water supply outside Tampa.
[01:29:38.902 --> 01:29:45.007]  Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Galtieri says a water treatment plant operator first noticed the remote access hack.
[01:29:45.588 --> 01:29:53.274]  The bad actor increased the amount of sodium hydroxide or lye in the water supply from 100 parts per million to more than 11,000.
[01:29:53.795 --> 01:30:01.721]  This type of activity and this type of hacking of critical infrastructure is not necessarily limited to just water supply systems.
[01:30:01.781 --> 01:30:03.083]  It can be anything.
[01:30:03.743 --> 01:30:04.344]  There was hundreds.
[01:30:04.944 --> 01:30:09.425]  Russell Murphy is referring to the fish now belly up in Leslie Run.
[01:30:09.906 --> 01:30:16.528]  He and his wife noticed them last night, barely 48 hours after the fiery derailment five miles away.
[01:30:16.548 --> 01:30:20.929]  We basically nuked a town with chemicals so we could get a railroad open.
[01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:25.651]  More than 250 trains have derailed in just the last decade.
[01:30:26.092 --> 01:30:28.573]  Half of those contained hazardous waste.
[01:30:28.993 --> 01:30:34.316]  Two more train derailments were just added to the pile in Texas and South Carolina.
[01:30:34.516 --> 01:30:46.222]  Ten days prior, the controlled burn of vinyl chloride in East Palestine, Ohio, contains the foul stench of the corporacratic disregard for human life, at the very least.
[01:30:46.562 --> 01:30:49.703]  Vinyl chloride is very hazardous and very flammable.
[01:30:49.723 --> 01:30:54.444]  The other thing about vinyl chloride is that it boils at 8 degrees Fahrenheit, so it's shipped in its liquid form.
[01:30:54.765 --> 01:31:02.527]  Meaning that when these trains crashed and these started leaking, they weren't just leaking liquid, but they were spewing boiling gas.
[01:31:02.887 --> 01:31:08.831]  There's maybe a million pounds of this toxic chemical spilling into the ground and also boiling off into the air.
[01:31:09.251 --> 01:31:13.874]  Of the many byproducts of burning vinyl chloride, one of them is hydrogen chloride.
[01:31:14.234 --> 01:31:22.140]  Hydrogen chloride's really unstable and latches onto water, like just water vapor in the atmosphere, and that turns into hydrochloric acid.
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:31.506]  So right now, government officials, officials from the railroad, both the governor of Pennsylvania and Ohio, are calling burning off the million pounds of this stuff a success.
[01:31:31.586 --> 01:31:36.945]   but not mentioning that it means that we have hundreds of thousands of pounds of acid in the air.
[01:31:36.945 --> 01:31:38.945]  This is their f***ing success!
[01:31:38.945 --> 01:31:43.945]  That ain't no f***ing storm cloud!
[01:31:43.945 --> 01:31:45.945]  That's some f***ing s***!
[01:31:45.945 --> 01:31:47.945]  Police policy!
[01:31:47.945 --> 01:31:49.945]  They're f***ing controlled birds!
[01:31:49.945 --> 01:31:57.546]   Lobbyists have successfully seen to it that their trains and an emergency electronic-controlled pneumatic brake
[01:31:57.546 --> 01:32:02.945]   system carrying the chemicals don't face federal regulations.
[01:32:03.154 --> 01:32:32.085]   Organized pandemics, cultural jackbooting, unyielding and increasing scarcity of food, water, and energy, weather manipulation, And airborne toxic events make for the perfect storm when subjected to an impending EMP event that would easily drive the masses and imprison those that objected into the detainment camps built under the guise of illegal immigration and documented in the 2010 Army Publication 3-39.40.
[01:32:35.026 --> 01:32:35.646]  That's right.
[01:32:36.126 --> 01:32:38.867]  Humans can actually cause earthquakes.
[01:32:39.227 --> 01:32:48.910]  All it takes in most areas is a little extra push, a little extra stress introduced in the right way on pre-existing faults and fractures to cause small earthquakes.
[01:32:49.210 --> 01:32:49.370]  U.S.
[01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:55.932]  Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said on the 28th of April 1997 at the Conference on Terrorism, Weapons of Mass Destruction, U.S.
[01:32:55.952 --> 01:33:09.377]   Strategy University of Georgia, While discussing the dangers of false threats, this is a quote, others are engaging even in the eco-type of terrorism, whereby they can alter the climate, shut off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely, for the use of electromagnetic waves.
[01:33:09.857 --> 01:33:10.798]  And who is the leader in that?
[01:33:11.505 --> 01:33:12.065]  The U.S.
[01:33:12.345 --> 01:33:13.526]  and Russia.
[01:33:13.666 --> 01:33:21.890]  And completion of tests in the months ahead of these new super weapons long advertised by the Kremlin head, Russian President Vladimir Putin, but often thought by U.S.
[01:33:21.930 --> 01:33:25.712]  officials to simply be too terrifying to ever be possible.
[01:33:25.852 --> 01:33:34.977]  As a soft and silent war creeps among the heartland under the compromised foreign oversight of the Biden New World Order doctrine.
[01:33:35.197 --> 01:33:47.596]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:33:47.674 --> 01:33:59.477]  It is a scientific fact for a hundred years that things like atrazine and phthalates and a whole spectrum of chemicals attack and destroy testosterone.
[01:34:00.297 --> 01:34:08.499]  But they also attack and destroy chemicals in a woman's womb that make the fetus express the male characteristics of its chromosomes.
[01:34:09.201 --> 01:34:20.246]  So it's not turning the little boys in their mother's wombs into girls, it's turning them more into eunuchs or drones, and not expressing their male characteristics.
[01:34:21.066 --> 01:34:32.311]  In all the studies, what these chemicals do is hyper-express the female characteristics, and they go, oh, you're the feminist, you're the powerful superwoman, yeah.
[01:34:32.931 --> 01:34:34.412]  You go into puberty not at 12, but at 8.
[01:34:36.178 --> 01:34:36.278]  Or 5.
[01:34:36.858 --> 01:34:37.899]  Some at 2 or 3 now.
[01:34:38.619 --> 01:34:42.681]  And you go into menopause at 30 instead of 45 or 50.
[01:34:42.941 --> 01:34:46.102]  And it shortens your life.
[01:34:47.243 --> 01:34:58.368]  And I've talked about this for decades and I noticed early on, when I would talk about it, national news, I mean I'm talking 20 years ago, 15 years ago, would attack me everywhere.
[01:34:59.148 --> 01:35:01.189]  Saying this crazy guy says there's chemicals.
[01:35:02.105 --> 01:35:05.806]  In the food and water that are manipulating you, but I had the studies.
[01:35:07.447 --> 01:35:08.907]  So here's some headlines that deal with this.
[01:35:09.007 --> 01:35:14.249]  Science needs to stop using terms like male, female, mother and father, researchers say, New York Post.
[01:35:15.869 --> 01:35:26.033]  Alternative terms like male and female and mother and father should be removed.
[01:35:29.194 --> 01:35:33.399]   Because They are dehumanizing us in what we are.
[01:35:33.939 --> 01:35:34.719]  Here's another headline.
[01:35:34.799 --> 01:35:40.081]  University-level gender unicorn teaches that chromosomes don't determine sex.
[01:35:40.761 --> 01:35:43.101]  That's redstate.com, when of course they do.
[01:35:43.121 --> 01:35:45.382]  2 plus 2 does not equal 4.
[01:35:46.262 --> 01:35:46.862]  Here's another one.
[01:35:50.704 --> 01:35:58.946]  Gestational, that means in your mother's womb, exposure to phthalates and gender-related play behaviors in 8-year-old children, an observational study.
[01:36:00.455 --> 01:36:14.264]  And it's a study how babies in the womb that have been tested the blood of the mother show that if you have these chemicals in you, you are more feminine.
[01:36:15.585 --> 01:36:17.566]  And here's the study right here from PubMed.
[01:36:21.469 --> 01:36:27.292]  So they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:36:28.753 --> 01:36:37.015]   And they are hitting us With these chemicals and then people are confused because they don't have male hormones.
[01:36:38.195 --> 01:36:42.195]  They don't activate when they're 10, 11, 12, 13.
[01:36:42.195 --> 01:36:49.355]  They never go into puberty as boys.
[01:36:49.519 --> 01:36:50.920]  The girls go into puberty early.
[01:36:52.130 --> 01:37:04.656]  And the boys then don't have those masculine chemicals in them that activate parts of the brain and activate instincts to go out and seek the opposite sex.
[01:37:05.976 --> 01:37:08.978]  And then you've got the depopulation program you wanted.
[01:37:11.155 --> 01:37:14.137]  And the system knows exactly what it's doing.
[01:37:14.537 --> 01:37:15.818]  Then they confuse things.
[01:37:16.579 --> 01:37:19.240]  Viewer discretion is advised here, even though it's blurted out.
[01:37:20.081 --> 01:37:25.385]  DeSantis reveals shocking porn books being removed from Florida schools.
[01:37:28.166 --> 01:37:29.127]  You see the headlines?
[01:37:30.168 --> 01:37:32.109]  DeSantis hates gay people.
[01:37:32.549 --> 01:37:33.550]  Don't say gay.
[01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:34.611]  That's not in the bill.
[01:37:36.209 --> 01:37:50.442]  They make the whole LGBTQXYZP operation about being nice to the persecuted gay people that are all over the news, all over the TV, all over the culture, all over everything, being force-fed to us because they don't produce children.
[01:37:50.462 --> 01:37:53.725]  It's the population, not against the people themselves, but that's the program.
[01:37:56.638 --> 01:38:04.683]  And then they sexualize children, because all the studies show if you sexualize them early, they won't be in a monogamous relationship, they won't be in a nuclear family.
[01:38:05.283 --> 01:38:12.147]  And nuclear families are a powerful bulwark against tyranny, and a bulwark that creates prosperity and wealth and success.
[01:38:12.587 --> 01:38:15.069]  Because that's what we're supposed to do, it's how we're designed.
[01:38:16.155 --> 01:38:26.645]  So when they want to eradicate a moth or a fire ant or some other bug, they put chemicals out that confuse the sexual activities of those insects or animals so they don't reproduce.
[01:38:26.665 --> 01:38:27.906]  And that's all that's been done here.
[01:38:28.506 --> 01:38:29.627]  It's a scientific attack.
[01:38:29.888 --> 01:38:31.189]  Let's address it for what it is.
[01:38:33.511 --> 01:38:46.836]   But if you take Vincent Price and the last man on Earth, Which was then remade from the 60s in the 70s into Omega Man and remade in the early 2000s as I Am Legend.
[01:38:48.576 --> 01:38:51.537]  For some reason, Vincent Price is immune.
[01:38:53.577 --> 01:38:59.078]  And the remake, Charlton Heston, is immune.
[01:39:00.739 --> 01:39:06.186]   And when they offer The zombies, most of them are dumb, but the ruling class is smarter.
[01:39:06.206 --> 01:39:11.549]  The zombies, the vampires, they're blood, and say, I have a cure to fix you.
[01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:14.410]  They say, dude, we don't want to be fixed.
[01:39:15.031 --> 01:39:16.331]  We're going to kill you.
[01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:19.393]  And that's the allegory of this.
[01:39:19.934 --> 01:39:30.960]  We have the cure for people that have been chemical attacked, and we know how to help them, but they don't want to be helped.
[01:39:33.322 --> 01:39:40.165]  The testosterone of a male today at age 40 is one-tenth of what it was in 1950.
[01:39:41.185 --> 01:39:41.585]  Look it up.
[01:39:42.346 --> 01:39:43.926]  Sperm counts are down over 90%.
[01:39:44.226 --> 01:39:45.647]  We're being murdered.
[01:39:45.987 --> 01:39:49.829]  Our biology, our design has been hacked and hijacked.
[01:39:51.589 --> 01:40:04.921]   And in the remake of The Last Man on Earth, Omega Man Charlton Heston at the end says, I've learned I'm immune, I've got the antibodies, you can be healed right now.
[01:40:04.941 --> 01:40:11.105]  And the zombies say, we don't want to be healed.
[01:40:12.746 --> 01:40:13.967]  And they throw a spear into him.
[01:40:16.887 --> 01:40:18.887]  and they haul him up and they crucify him.
[01:40:18.887 --> 01:40:26.007]  And that's what this is.
[01:40:26.034 --> 01:40:28.055]  They're organizing all the people they've hit.
[01:40:29.073 --> 01:40:35.478]  All the people they've hurt, all the people they've attacked, into adopting what's been done to them.
[01:40:35.498 --> 01:40:54.674]  And that's what that globalist on that airline flight, so many years ago, 2006, whenever it was, I'm on American Airlines, first-class flight to be on The View, and one of the heads of one of the three largest banks in the world is on the flight with me, going to visit his dad in a nursing home in San Antonio.
[01:40:57.281 --> 01:40:59.402]  And we have a three-hour off-the-record conversation.
[01:41:00.623 --> 01:41:01.064]  Off-the-record.
[01:41:01.084 --> 01:41:01.784]  I couldn't say his name.
[01:41:01.844 --> 01:41:02.385]  I said, I agree.
[01:41:03.105 --> 01:41:04.026]  He said, you don't get it.
[01:41:04.846 --> 01:41:10.650]  They're going to adopt the pressure and the attacks.
[01:41:10.670 --> 01:41:12.772]  They're not going to adopt and overcome like a Marine.
[01:41:13.172 --> 01:41:20.177]  They're going to adopt and overcome by submission to what we are doing to them.
[01:41:21.538 --> 01:41:22.138]  And that's it.
[01:41:24.179 --> 01:41:24.780]  It's incredible.
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:27.401]  And it's very, very sad.
[01:41:27.421 --> 01:41:33.744]  All right, your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen, are coming up on the other side of this broadcast.
[01:41:34.605 --> 01:41:34.925]  Break.
[01:41:35.325 --> 01:41:35.805]  Stay with us.
[01:41:37.126 --> 01:41:41.329]  All right, let me make one more point before I go back to your phone calls here on this Thursday live broadcast.
[01:41:43.110 --> 01:41:53.196]  I'm here showing you mainline articles that the chemicals in the water are feminizing boys and hyper-feminizing girls and accelerating their aging and causing all these health problems and cancer.
[01:41:54.096 --> 01:41:55.337]  But you don't need to even look at that.
[01:41:55.457 --> 01:42:04.165]  You have a giant push globally by big corporations to put little children on hormone blockers, boys and girls, and cut their genitals off and cut their breasts off.
[01:42:05.866 --> 01:42:10.090]  So that's just them going to the logical conclusion of that depopulation plan.
[01:42:11.191 --> 01:42:12.532]  Unbelievably insane.
[01:42:14.141 --> 01:42:20.826]  And then DeSantis reveals the shocking porn books being removed from Florida schools, which the media said, oh, he's anti-gay.
[01:42:21.247 --> 01:42:22.888]  No, this is what he's banning.
[01:42:23.328 --> 01:42:26.771]  If two men want to go have sex together, that's their business.
[01:42:26.831 --> 01:42:28.332]  We don't, we're not talking about it.
[01:42:31.835 --> 01:42:40.122]  Targeting children with homosexual or heterosexual BS is called pedophilia, and it's wrong, and we will reject it, and we are rejecting it.
[01:42:40.982 --> 01:42:41.663]  Look at this headline.
[01:42:43.089 --> 01:42:45.711]  I see this headline every day from some other publication.
[01:42:46.071 --> 01:42:46.812]  It's a talking point.
[01:42:47.192 --> 01:42:55.218]  How drag queens became a right-wing target from Alex Jones to Tucker Carlson with the states trying to ban story hours and shows.
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:04.325]  No, I personally as a little kid laughed at Bob Hope on TV dressed like a woman running around acting silly.
[01:43:05.333 --> 01:43:09.616]  And there's lots of movies of drag queens, and it's funny, and it's ridiculous.
[01:43:09.636 --> 01:43:16.840]  You know, we've all seen Police Academy, where the cops dress up like hookers, and they go bust hookers, and they've got beards, and it's a joke.
[01:43:17.601 --> 01:43:21.003]  No one's attacking men dressing up like women.
[01:43:24.165 --> 01:43:25.906]  Hell, Steven Crowder does that, it's hilarious.
[01:43:27.532 --> 01:43:35.756]  We're attacking people that are attacking children and saying we're grooming you and we want little kids to sit on our laps and teach them about sex.
[01:43:36.416 --> 01:43:38.617]  We want you to not target children.
[01:43:39.038 --> 01:43:41.459]  It's not how drag queens have become a right-wing target.
[01:43:41.739 --> 01:43:48.062]  It's how sexualizing children and pedophilic behavior has become a right-wing target.
[01:43:49.262 --> 01:43:50.223]  Let's go to Florida.
[01:43:52.412 --> 01:43:59.615]  And Tim wants to talk about the elephant in the room, Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, all of them coming out against world government, to the world government's face.
[01:44:00.015 --> 01:44:01.196]  What do you make of that, Tim?
[01:44:01.216 --> 01:44:01.816]  Thanks for calling.
[01:44:02.636 --> 01:44:03.617]  Hi, Alex.
[01:44:03.837 --> 01:44:07.398]  I spoke with you a few weeks back about region building.
[01:44:08.139 --> 01:44:17.863]  The globalists plan to have incremental steps with regional blocks around the world as an incremental step toward globalism.
[01:44:18.143 --> 01:44:18.363]  Yes.
[01:44:18.603 --> 01:44:29.047]   And so the comments by Elon Musk I have to say, they are not inconsistent with what globalists have said back for decades.
[01:44:29.628 --> 01:44:34.971]  You can quote, I got Schwab, Brzezinski, Kissinger, Richard Gardner, and Lincoln Bloomfield.
[01:44:35.451 --> 01:44:41.274]  All of them talk about region building as the incremental step toward... No, you're right.
[01:44:41.315 --> 01:44:43.696]  I'm not defending Musk, but he specifically says nation states.
[01:44:44.164 --> 01:44:45.665]  Well, I know, but that's the point.
[01:44:46.306 --> 01:44:49.269]  They try to make a play between nationalism and globalism.
[01:44:49.289 --> 01:44:53.953]  So you're saying that he's creating a false overton window where you still have globalism?
[01:44:53.973 --> 01:44:55.234]  Yes, a regionalism.
[01:44:55.434 --> 01:45:02.640]  And that's exactly what Klaus Schwab said in his book on the Great Reset.
[01:45:03.021 --> 01:45:15.710]   He said that regionalism would be an in-between position, a compromise between nationalism And I just like the North American Union that the Mexican President called for last month.
[01:45:15.810 --> 01:45:16.510]  Absolutely.
[01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:20.572]  The African Union, South American Union, Eurasian Union.
[01:45:20.972 --> 01:45:25.593]  I have an article on this Klaus Schwab thing on my website.
[01:45:25.673 --> 01:45:28.394]  I hope sometime you can go and look at my website, Alex.
[01:45:28.915 --> 01:45:30.415]  I've had it since 2011.
[01:45:30.855 --> 01:45:33.056]  It's circumspectnews.com.
[01:45:33.836 --> 01:45:35.397]  And it's all played out.
[01:45:37.057 --> 01:45:37.638]  Say that again?
[01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:38.258]  Circumspect?
[01:45:39.008 --> 01:45:41.489]  circumspectnews.com.
[01:45:41.649 --> 01:45:43.950]  All right, I'll check it out.
[01:45:45.250 --> 01:45:49.072]  So what do you make of Musk and now suddenly, oh, there's a world government, we should oppose it.
[01:45:49.452 --> 01:45:54.614]  What do you make of them going from it doesn't exist, the globalists saying it does exist, and now this so-called opposition?
[01:45:55.094 --> 01:46:01.316]  Well, they do oppose, they must talk about a single world government.
[01:46:01.777 --> 01:46:02.857]  Well, they're not going there.
[01:46:03.317 --> 01:46:04.518]  They're not going there first.
[01:46:04.738 --> 01:46:09.513]   In fact, We can't get ahead of ourselves, Alex.
[01:46:09.874 --> 01:46:11.257]  You know, I know you believe the Bible.
[01:46:11.818 --> 01:46:14.445]  The Bible narrative, when it opens on the beast system...
[01:46:15.268 --> 01:46:16.468]  It opens with ten kings.
[01:46:16.888 --> 01:46:17.128]  Yes.
[01:46:17.328 --> 01:46:19.369]  It doesn't open with a single world government.
[01:46:19.389 --> 01:46:21.189]  No, ten kings and three megaregions.
[01:46:21.209 --> 01:46:23.710]  It doesn't even talk about trilateral regions.
[01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:26.050]  It talks about ten kings, not three kings.
[01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:32.311]  Now, I know the globalists want to get to three, the trilateral, but they ain't going to get there for a long time.
[01:46:32.511 --> 01:46:33.531]  Well, then talk about the Bible.
[01:46:33.571 --> 01:46:33.911]  You're right.
[01:46:34.012 --> 01:46:34.712]  It's the ten kings.
[01:46:34.732 --> 01:46:36.732]  You've got the little horn.
[01:46:36.772 --> 01:46:36.872]  Right.
[01:46:37.811 --> 01:46:44.811]   But you know, the 1984 scenario, where the three trilateral governments, Oceania, Eurasia,
[01:46:44.811 --> 01:46:53.091]   East Asia, their constant perpetual war against each other is what the globalists are going
[01:46:53.091 --> 01:46:58.412]   to use, but instead of doing it among three, they're going to do it among ten.
[01:46:58.412 --> 01:47:04.931]   And that's what Kissinger called the new mercantilism, a constant war, conflict, competition among
[01:47:04.931 --> 01:47:05.931]  the tens.
[01:47:05.931 --> 01:47:10.930]  That's the multipolar world that they're talking about.
[01:47:10.930 --> 01:47:15.612]  And I hope you go and get an overview of this.
[01:47:15.586 --> 01:47:18.206]  I know Putin's pushing a multipolar world.
[01:47:18.586 --> 01:47:22.427]  Alex Newman of the New American Magazine, he's got a grasp of this.
[01:47:22.687 --> 01:47:25.948]  Sometime if you could get him on, he'd be really good to interview on this.
[01:47:26.408 --> 01:47:27.608]  All right, brother, appreciate your call.
[01:47:27.968 --> 01:47:29.428]  Let's talk to Douglas in Ohio.
[01:47:29.468 --> 01:47:30.089]  Go ahead, Douglas.
[01:47:31.649 --> 01:47:35.350]  Yeah, Alex, first of all, I want to thank you and the crew for all that you do.
[01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:39.571]  Bless all of you guys.
[01:47:40.052 --> 01:47:41.493]  I'd like to talk about a couple things.
[01:47:42.874 --> 01:47:46.318]  First, I'd like to say that I called in years ago.
[01:47:46.338 --> 01:47:47.519]  Are you there?
[01:47:48.844 --> 01:47:49.205]  Absolutely.
[01:47:49.225 --> 01:47:51.186]  You guys call in and then you like start talking.
[01:47:51.226 --> 01:47:51.927]  You say, am I here?
[01:47:52.327 --> 01:47:53.648]  You are on the air, Douglas.
[01:47:53.948 --> 01:47:54.508]  I promise you.
[01:47:54.528 --> 01:47:55.069]  Thank you, sir.
[01:47:55.489 --> 01:48:00.753]  I called in quite a few years ago and offered a solution well before it even happened.
[01:48:00.833 --> 01:48:02.514]  And you guys created an excerpt.
[01:48:03.055 --> 01:48:04.015]  It was on YouTube.
[01:48:04.076 --> 01:48:04.836]  They took it down.
[01:48:05.156 --> 01:48:08.259]  And it was called, Truckers Could Stop Runaway Tyranny.
[01:48:08.699 --> 01:48:14.844]  And I just want to reiterate that we need to, instead of buying a stop phone, we need to buy a CD.
[01:48:15.404 --> 01:48:20.323]   We need to get out and reach to the truckers and spread your word, Alex.
[01:48:20.323 --> 01:48:27.163]   Truckers are the most powerful industry in America and without them, we will get nowhere.
[01:48:27.163 --> 01:48:31.904]   And second of all, I'd like to say, put a promotion in for your products.
[01:48:31.904 --> 01:48:33.404]  We use all your products.
[01:48:33.404 --> 01:48:37.824]   I've been listening to you for 20 years, Alex, and I wanna thank you.
[01:48:37.824 --> 01:48:42.603]   I mean, you bring tears to my eyes for all that you've done for me and my family.
[01:48:42.603 --> 01:48:44.804]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[01:48:44.466 --> 01:48:45.647]  I want to thank you, brother, but you're right.
[01:48:45.667 --> 01:48:53.956]  What is it, like 90% of freight gets delivered by truck, and the truckers are the most powerful force you've seen in Australia, Europe, Canada.
[01:48:54.317 --> 01:48:56.078]  The truckers really exercising their power.
[01:48:56.419 --> 01:48:58.241]  Why aren't American truckers doing that yet?
[01:48:59.884 --> 01:49:06.947]  That's what I'd like to know and I have some suggestions and one would be everybody get a CD and start talking to the truckers.
[01:49:07.347 --> 01:49:23.853]  Another thing is maybe we need some type of crowd sourcing to create like a video truck like Project Veritas did at Pfizer and go around to these truck stops and just sit there and play excerpts of you and all this stuff going on.
[01:49:24.581 --> 01:49:25.843]  I totally agree.
[01:49:25.863 --> 01:49:27.184]  We've got to supercharge the truckers.
[01:49:27.003 --> 01:49:32.503]   because we need them in this fight. Without them, I don't think we're going to go anywhere.
[01:49:32.503 --> 01:49:35.503]  I totally agree. We've got to supercharge the truckers.
[01:49:35.503 --> 01:49:37.003]  Anything else, Douglas?
[01:49:37.003 --> 01:49:42.003]   Yeah, I'd like to, you know, banj you guys, talk about the Illuminati.
[01:49:42.007 --> 01:49:45.228]  What about getting Fritz Springmeier back on or Doug Borkey?
[01:49:45.408 --> 01:49:47.568]  You know, I haven't had Fritz on in like 15 years.
[01:49:47.628 --> 01:49:49.009]  I've tried to get him on like a decade ago.
[01:49:49.089 --> 01:49:51.649]  I don't even, I will try to get Fritz Springmeier on.
[01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:52.650]  I appreciate your call.
[01:49:53.370 --> 01:49:55.230]  All right, and the order received.
[01:49:55.370 --> 01:49:57.951]  Michael in Texas and others.
[01:49:57.991 --> 01:50:01.412]  We're going to go to your calls when we come back on the other side.
[01:50:01.432 --> 01:50:02.352]  Then Mark in New York.
[01:50:03.272 --> 01:50:04.594]  And so many others.
[01:50:05.134 --> 01:50:05.835]  Stay with us.
[01:50:06.396 --> 01:50:07.758]  Infowars.com.
[01:50:08.338 --> 01:50:10.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:16.548]  I've also got some huge poison vaccine news, and some economic news, and some war news, and some race war news.
[01:50:16.908 --> 01:50:18.871]  We'll try to cram it all in straight ahead.
[01:50:18.891 --> 01:50:23.076]  I am burning inside to fight the globalists.
[01:50:24.088 --> 01:50:25.669]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:30.170]  We're not here promoting all the false ideologies and all the distractions and all the rabbit trails.
[01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:36.350]   We're talking about New World Order, Mark of the Beast, forced injections, the attack on our children.
[01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:45.350]  Right and wrong.
[01:50:45.615 --> 01:50:52.615]  New World Order.
[01:50:52.615 --> 01:50:59.295]  My work is almost done here, my friends.
[01:50:59.295 --> 01:51:00.295]  (Laughs)
[01:51:00.295 --> 01:51:10.295]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:51:03.292 --> 01:51:08.796]  We're here to make sure you're warned, so you can make your decision about what side you're on.
[01:51:09.917 --> 01:51:18.845]  We still have important work to do, but we have completed the first mission we were given, and now the public has a choice to make.
[01:51:23.569 --> 01:51:30.569]  a new world order.
[01:51:30.569 --> 01:51:32.569]  Alright, let's rampage through your calls.
[01:51:32.988 --> 01:51:35.490]  Michael in the great state of Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:51:36.910 --> 01:51:39.092]  Alejandro, happy birthday brother.
[01:51:39.592 --> 01:51:40.692]  Love you brother, what's on your mind?
[01:51:41.853 --> 01:51:50.378]  Hey, I just wanted to mention, old Bill Cooper from way back in the day, from back in the 90's is where I first heard about you.
[01:51:51.696 --> 01:52:01.004]  Thanks to both of you guys and, you know, his book, Behold the Pale Horse, and talk about UFOs, silent weapons from quiet wars, and mystery schools.
[01:52:01.684 --> 01:52:03.646]  I learned a lot from you guys.
[01:52:04.306 --> 01:52:05.027]  I'm so thankful.
[01:52:05.127 --> 01:52:07.109]  Yeah, Bill Cooper was an amazing person.
[01:52:08.095 --> 01:52:09.435]  Yeah, he was, yeah.
[01:52:09.615 --> 01:52:13.076]  Sorry what happened to him, but you know, we got to keep moving forward.
[01:52:13.737 --> 01:52:18.698]  And I'm so grateful that I've been listening to you for all these years.
[01:52:18.738 --> 01:52:20.238]  You lit a fire under my butt.
[01:52:20.438 --> 01:52:22.219]  You know, I did better for myself.
[01:52:22.439 --> 01:52:24.760]  Moved out to the country just outside of Austin.
[01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:33.102]  Uh, started my own business and knowing that nobody, I'm not a socialist, hate socialism, hate growing up on food stamps.
[01:52:33.926 --> 01:52:36.088]  And you know, made it for myself.
[01:52:36.248 --> 01:52:36.649]  Beautiful.
[01:52:36.669 --> 01:52:37.570]  Doing really good.
[01:52:38.530 --> 01:52:41.793]  And, you know, your product has helped me so much.
[01:52:42.394 --> 01:52:46.838]  My wife is, you know, the knockout and rock at rest.
[01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:50.361]  Her favorite go-to every night.
[01:52:51.302 --> 01:53:02.635]   She just came down with breast cancer and she tried your CBD oil because, you know, as Mike says it's a full spectrum, so we're going to try that.
[01:53:02.655 --> 01:53:07.357]  Well, you know what grows breast cancer is the glyphosate that's in the water supply and the food.
[01:53:07.377 --> 01:53:08.517]  I'm so sorry to hear that, brother.
[01:53:09.257 --> 01:53:16.721]  Yeah, I mean, but, you know, we just got to keep going forward with it, you know, the, you know, doing the protocol and stuff.
[01:53:17.641 --> 01:53:18.361]  I just want to read.
[01:53:20.485 --> 01:53:26.324]   Infowarriors out there, you know, get with it, you know, get ready, be prepared.
[01:53:26.324 --> 01:53:29.925]  I did send you a little something via the mail.
[01:53:29.925 --> 01:53:34.206]   It's in a big old Home Depot box, a product that hopefully you can look at.
[01:53:34.206 --> 01:53:37.485]   And if you're interested, you know, we could partner together.
[01:53:37.485 --> 01:53:38.965]  I will, brother. I'll look it up.
[01:53:38.965 --> 01:53:40.565]  Thank you so much, Michael.
[01:53:40.565 --> 01:53:42.965]  We're moving quick here. Mark in New York here on the air.
[01:53:42.965 --> 01:53:45.605]  Hey, how you doing, Alex? Good, brother.
[01:53:45.605 --> 01:53:47.765]  God bless you, my brother.
[01:53:47.793 --> 01:53:51.535]  I've been watching you from the beginning, and you are fabulous.
[01:53:51.835 --> 01:53:52.555]  You're fabulous.
[01:53:53.216 --> 01:53:53.836]  Thank you, brother.
[01:53:53.856 --> 01:53:54.216]  Thank you.
[01:53:54.236 --> 01:54:01.399]  You know, I think with this WHO, this World Health Organization, you know, they're pulling a stunt now.
[01:54:02.219 --> 01:54:10.523]  What I just read from out of Redacted, they're trying to bring out some new Marburg and a vaccine to go with it.
[01:54:10.683 --> 01:54:11.003]  That's right.
[01:54:11.023 --> 01:54:12.083]  That's next segment.
[01:54:13.284 --> 01:54:14.404]  Incredible information.
[01:54:14.444 --> 01:54:16.265]  They are really getting their new weapon ready.
[01:54:17.213 --> 01:54:18.194]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:54:18.414 --> 01:54:20.115]  And Redacted is trying to push on that.
[01:54:20.275 --> 01:54:28.279]  If you want to get the information, try to look it up or whatever, you know, you have to do to get it so we can push that out there and make people aware of what's coming next.
[01:54:28.339 --> 01:54:33.521]  If that's going to be the one that's coming next besides anything else with this nuclear war, that's another thing.
[01:54:33.561 --> 01:54:41.865]   I feel that the WHO is pushing it and everybody else is pushing it like it's Well, I know this, they're trying to make us give up, but giving in to them only makes it worse.
[01:54:41.685 --> 01:54:51.085]   They're trying to have us submit to anything that they push because I don't really feel they wanna destroy the planet
[01:54:51.085 --> 01:54:54.845]   or the plane, I call it a plane because I don't believe it's a globe.
[01:54:54.845 --> 01:54:59.864]  That they can have most of it for themselves.
[01:54:59.864 --> 01:55:05.364]   Well, I know this, they're trying to make us give up, but giving into them only makes it worse.
[01:55:05.364 --> 01:55:08.285]  Submitting to tyranny only enslaves you worse.
[01:55:08.285 --> 01:55:09.985]  Yes, we're not doing that, Alex.
[01:55:10.015 --> 01:55:14.657]  As long as we're around and you're here, regardless of the matter, we are not doing that.
[01:55:15.617 --> 01:55:17.238]  Beautiful brother, I appreciate your call.
[01:55:19.579 --> 01:55:21.740]  Black Rant from South Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:55:23.901 --> 01:55:27.423]  Hello Alex Jones, thank you very much for letting me call in.
[01:55:28.934 --> 01:55:33.777]  I love your show and I've been listening, I guess, for about 20 years now, driving my wife crazy with it.
[01:55:35.158 --> 01:55:45.203]  But I have to say that before I found you, and this was a subject from an earlier caller, fatherlessness, my father had a book in our house.
[01:55:45.463 --> 01:55:48.145]  Well, tons of books, but he had a book in our house from David Icke.
[01:55:49.327 --> 01:55:59.314]  And that was in like 1997-98 and he called out 9-11 and he called out all these other things and talked about the interdimensional entities and whatnot.
[01:55:59.634 --> 01:56:08.600]  And I wanted to call in about Project Bluebeam and how this is the globalist's last chance, the elitist's last final card that they're playing.
[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:16.770]   There's videos all over the internet talking about these You know, UFOs being shot down and creating sensationalism around it.
[01:56:17.130 --> 01:56:23.755]  And our society is so misdirected, that that is the thing that's going to encapsulate everything that they want.
[01:56:24.075 --> 01:56:34.884]  The globalists are going to get their pedophilia, they're going to get their global government, they're going to get their lockdown, they're going to get people moving into cities and safe zones and regions, all due to that emergency.
[01:56:35.284 --> 01:56:41.618]   And COVID was The first test of locking down and having a global emergency.
[01:56:41.879 --> 01:56:45.241]  Could you imagine when they actually start this Bluebeam project?
[01:56:45.281 --> 01:56:47.022]  And Gregg Reese did an amazing video on it.
[01:56:47.302 --> 01:56:49.664]  But could you imagine when they actually do this?
[01:56:50.204 --> 01:56:51.465]  People were stunned.
[01:56:51.565 --> 01:56:54.627]  I still see people walking around with masks on to this day.
[01:56:55.267 --> 01:56:58.810]  Could you imagine if people thought that there was an alien invasion happening?
[01:56:58.910 --> 01:57:00.771]  So I don't think it's going to happen this year.
[01:57:00.791 --> 01:57:03.653]  It's going to happen probably four or five years in the future.
[01:57:03.673 --> 01:57:04.253]  I agree with you though.
[01:57:04.373 --> 01:57:05.614]  They're definitely prepping it.
[01:57:07.233 --> 01:57:21.762]  Yes, they're definitely prepping it, and 70 years will be the anniversary of when Eisenhower, next year, February 20th, will be 70 years since when Eisenhower allegedly met with these aliens and formed this treaty.
[01:57:22.203 --> 01:57:30.788]  I don't know anything about that, I'm not saying that's real or true, but that would be something to see if next year we started seeing an uptick in this phenomenon.
[01:57:31.048 --> 01:57:32.509]  We will definitely track it, sir.
[01:57:32.529 --> 01:57:33.250]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:33.370 --> 01:57:34.711]  Patty in Boston, go ahead.
[01:57:37.214 --> 01:57:44.897]  Alex, I found it very irritating that you were talking about people who live in cities earlier in a denigrating fashion.
[01:57:45.217 --> 01:57:50.440]  I think that the fact of the matter is you're a rich kid from the Dallas suburbs, and you're talking about work?
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:56.602]  You wouldn't know work if it actually, you know, slapped its balls against your chin.
[01:57:57.122 --> 01:58:01.204]  Like, I just think that you're not a guy who understands work, man.
[01:58:01.264 --> 01:58:01.904]  You're a rich kid.
[01:58:02.344 --> 01:58:03.285]  So whatever.
[01:58:03.445 --> 01:58:04.185]  Oh, hold on.
[01:58:04.265 --> 01:58:05.646]  Let me respond to what you said.
[01:58:06.286 --> 01:58:07.227]  I wouldn't say a rich kid.
[01:58:07.247 --> 01:58:12.754]  My dad was a dentist and I grew up in a four bedroom house in Dallas, but we were definitely middle class.
[01:58:13.715 --> 01:58:16.038]  And I've had a lot of jobs.
[01:58:16.078 --> 01:58:16.859]  I've worked on ranches.
[01:58:16.919 --> 01:58:17.740]  I've worked on farms.
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:20.303]  I've worked for large animal vets, small animal vets.
[01:58:20.363 --> 01:58:23.167]  I started my show 28 years ago.
[01:58:23.187 --> 01:58:23.988]  It's been very successful.
[01:58:24.048 --> 01:58:25.469]  I work seven days a week.
[01:58:26.090 --> 01:58:36.400]  And I do know how to skid a buck, run a trot line, run electricity, do basic stuff on cars, know how to change a tire, know how to cook an incredible dinner.
[01:58:36.861 --> 01:58:40.284]  So the idea that you call in and say, I'm incompetent, I'm not accomplished.
[01:58:40.645 --> 01:58:41.886]  You're right, Patty.
[01:58:42.306 --> 01:58:43.708]  I'm totally unaccomplished.
[01:58:43.928 --> 01:58:44.709]  I'm a nobody.
[01:58:45.089 --> 01:58:46.050]  You're incredible.
[01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:49.674]  And when I say people should try to get to the country, I'm wrong.
[01:58:50.114 --> 01:58:54.056]  I've said my grandfathers knew way more than I did, and I've lost a lot of knowledge.
[01:58:54.316 --> 01:59:07.903]  So I didn't sit up here and say that I was Paul Bunyan, or that, you know, I was, I mean, I don't know who I can say, like, you know, the greatest frontiersman ever, you know, somebody that got killed at the Alamo or something.
[01:59:08.424 --> 01:59:09.644]  I'm just related to those people.
[01:59:10.004 --> 01:59:10.685]  So you're right.
[01:59:10.825 --> 01:59:11.965]  I'm the scum of the earth.
[01:59:12.386 --> 01:59:14.267]  I can't find my ass with both hands.
[01:59:14.647 --> 01:59:15.527]  You are superior.
[01:59:15.827 --> 01:59:16.668]  What else you want to add?
[01:59:17.955 --> 01:59:23.078]  No, I think almost anybody could find your ass with both hands, because it's about 350 pounds.
[01:59:23.258 --> 01:59:33.924]  Okay, so again, you're powerful, I'm bad, so we should stay in the cities, in high-rise buildings, and not, we shouldn't grow gardens, we shouldn't try to, is that what you're saying?
[01:59:35.065 --> 01:59:37.026]  No, I think you should just lay off the burgers.
[01:59:38.527 --> 01:59:39.748]  I actually don't drink a lot of bourbon.
[01:59:40.768 --> 01:59:46.372]  But, let me continue, no, no, no, no, you called in to say people that live in the cities, so I'm going to hold you over, Patty.
[01:59:48.103 --> 01:59:49.265]  Are you transgender, Patty?
[01:59:50.005 --> 01:59:50.746]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:50.766 --> 01:59:51.307]  Stay with us.
[01:59:51.808 --> 01:59:52.429]  What a joke.
[01:59:52.669 --> 01:59:53.770]  Can't wait to talk to this clown.
[01:59:54.071 --> 01:59:55.332]  This is entertainment, folks.
[01:59:55.512 --> 02:00:07.832]  Stay with us.
[02:00:07.810 --> 02:00:08.091]  Central.
[02:00:08.111 --> 02:00:17.139]  And I don't know who Patrick is, calls himself Patty from Boston, but the crew says they know him, that he's a Owen Schroyer stalker that has come to our events and stuff.
[02:00:17.539 --> 02:00:19.220]  So he called it about people who live in the city.
[02:00:19.341 --> 02:00:20.782]  I mean, we're not talking about people who live in the city.
[02:00:20.822 --> 02:00:25.266]  I'm just saying the cities are control grids, 15-minute cities, the New World Order, all that.
[02:00:26.947 --> 02:00:28.868]  Are you mad that Owen Troyer doesn't like you?
[02:00:28.888 --> 02:00:34.971]  Because I'm really hurt right now that you called in and said I'm weak and pathetic and powerless.
[02:00:35.051 --> 02:00:37.292]  I'm gonna cry in my pillow tonight, Patrick.
[02:00:37.652 --> 02:00:40.433]  But Patrick, why are you really mad at us, Patrick?
[02:00:41.653 --> 02:00:46.195]  Well, when you're done biting your pillow, you can cry into it as much as you want.
[02:00:46.435 --> 02:00:47.276]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:00:47.296 --> 02:00:48.916]  I don't have time for like hooligans.
[02:00:48.976 --> 02:00:49.617]  I appreciate your call.
[02:00:49.637 --> 02:00:50.157]  Look at that guy.
[02:00:51.137 --> 02:00:54.879]  I mean, I'm sorry mommy didn't take care of you and give you the milk you needed.
[02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:57.561]  Alright, let's go to Joseph in Utah.
[02:00:57.601 --> 02:00:58.502]  Joseph, you're on the air.
[02:00:58.522 --> 02:00:58.902]  Go ahead.
[02:00:59.963 --> 02:01:00.543]  Yes, Alex.
[02:01:00.603 --> 02:01:01.824]  I'm Joseph from Utah.
[02:01:02.024 --> 02:01:03.725]  That guy has nothing on you, Alex.
[02:01:03.765 --> 02:01:05.046]  Don't even let him get near you.
[02:01:05.367 --> 02:01:06.788]  Oh, I mean, it's funny, actually.
[02:01:06.848 --> 02:01:07.608]  It's just pathetic.
[02:01:08.589 --> 02:01:08.869]  I know.
[02:01:09.069 --> 02:01:09.429]  I agree.
[02:01:09.449 --> 02:01:10.690]  But he's stupid, Alex.
[02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:17.134]  Listen, listen, um, I mean, um, um, Aaron Burr, I've been on a while, so I got nervous now.
[02:01:17.435 --> 02:01:19.716]  Aaron Burr, the town where that train derailed?
[02:01:20.457 --> 02:01:20.797]  Okay?
[02:01:21.217 --> 02:01:24.780]  Aaron Burr also was the Vice President of the United States in the 1800s.
[02:01:25.942 --> 02:01:32.888]  And he had a duel with Alexander Hamilton, who is the Secretary of Treasury in Weehawken, okay?
[02:01:33.008 --> 02:01:34.729]  And then he died.
[02:01:34.929 --> 02:01:40.294]  Alexander Hamilton died about two days later, give or take, okay?
[02:01:40.354 --> 02:01:41.955]  And I just wanted to throw that out there.
[02:01:42.356 --> 02:01:53.244]  I have a feeling, because our dollar's going down the tube, and the town that we have this next derailment is in Van Buren, okay?
[02:01:53.305 --> 02:01:53.765]  Township.
[02:01:54.424 --> 02:01:56.044]  And I just wanted to throw it out there.
[02:01:56.344 --> 02:01:59.425]  And another item, do you understand what I just said about that, sir?
[02:01:59.445 --> 02:02:01.505]  Yeah, you're saying it's like an archetypal calling card.
[02:02:03.326 --> 02:02:04.066]  That's what you call it?
[02:02:04.126 --> 02:02:05.406]  An archetypal calling card?
[02:02:05.666 --> 02:02:05.926]  Yes.
[02:02:06.926 --> 02:02:09.167]  Okay, now let me ask you one other question, please.
[02:02:09.707 --> 02:02:10.007]  Okay?
[02:02:10.267 --> 02:02:13.527]  And that is, very quick, that is Art Bell.
[02:02:14.067 --> 02:02:23.549]  Did you have any, did he influence you in any way, either radio-wise or in any way, or did you have to listen to him, please?
[02:02:24.835 --> 02:02:26.116]  I did listen to Art Bell quite a bit.
[02:02:26.136 --> 02:02:30.880]  I wasn't a big UFO guy, but I thought he was a masterful talk show host, and just amazing to listen to him.
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:31.780]  I listen to Art Bell a lot.
[02:02:32.941 --> 02:02:36.324]  Yeah, because your format, your format with the, what do you call it again?
[02:02:36.344 --> 02:02:37.705]  Your format, we'll just leave it at that.
[02:02:37.745 --> 02:02:43.169]  You have several formats, and he has several formats, and you kind of overlap.
[02:02:43.509 --> 02:02:50.595]  Yeah, I wouldn't call him a major influence on the show, but I mean, a very smooth broadcaster who I respect.
[02:02:51.653 --> 02:02:52.334]  Yeah, he was good.
[02:02:52.634 --> 02:02:57.039]  And one thing later, Alex, I'd like to tell you something one day later.
[02:02:57.439 --> 02:03:02.304]  It's about Benjamin Franklin and Malta and the Revolutionary War.
[02:03:02.445 --> 02:03:05.248]  If you Google that, you will find something amazing.
[02:03:05.568 --> 02:03:12.135]  The Knights of Malta and 1,800 Maltese volunteers for the French Navy and Chesapeake Bay.
[02:03:12.839 --> 02:03:17.441]  Absolutely.
[02:03:17.661 --> 02:03:21.423]  Thank you so much, Joseph.
[02:03:21.963 --> 02:03:24.244]  Dano from Hawaii Five-O.
[02:03:25.125 --> 02:03:25.925]  Book him, Dano.
[02:03:26.025 --> 02:03:27.126]  Calling from California.
[02:03:27.166 --> 02:03:27.526]  Go ahead.
[02:03:28.326 --> 02:03:28.927]  Hey, Alex.
[02:03:28.987 --> 02:03:30.007]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:03:30.427 --> 02:03:38.471]  Hey, I just wanted to touch base on some very important things like all the tests and the balloons and all this distractions in Russia.
[02:03:40.959 --> 02:03:41.979]  It's making too much sense.
[02:03:42.059 --> 02:03:44.020]  I mean, just all these distractions all at once.
[02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:45.260]  Everything is something every day.
[02:03:45.681 --> 02:03:46.281]  Now look at this.
[02:03:46.401 --> 02:03:50.502]  Russia's about to declare war any day on Ukraine right now is what the word I hear.
[02:03:50.862 --> 02:03:52.843]  They got 97% of the front line up there.
[02:03:52.863 --> 02:03:56.144]  They got nuclear war weapons attached to the things out in the Baltic Sea.
[02:03:56.444 --> 02:03:56.984]  They're ready.
[02:03:57.264 --> 02:03:59.325]  So they're about to unleash on Ukraine.
[02:03:59.365 --> 02:04:13.743]   That's a perfect distraction because when they do that, We're we are going to concentrate nothing about on it because we're depleting our military starting everything Ukraine Ukraine along with all these other countries and when that happens Alec this is the perfect time for China to take Taiwan.
[02:04:13.783 --> 02:04:13.983]  Why?
[02:04:14.164 --> 02:04:14.604]  You know that?
[02:04:14.884 --> 02:04:19.178]   Because no everybody's going to be distracted and while they do that I totally agree.
[02:04:18.998 --> 02:04:22.958]   and they're going to have to defend and help us help try to sit there and stop them from
[02:04:22.958 --> 02:04:23.958]  taking Taiwan.
[02:04:23.958 --> 02:04:27.458]   And that's going to sit there and take what little military we have left supporting our
[02:04:27.458 --> 02:04:31.257]   borders right now because we're so embarrassed with the balloon fighting that's been in our
[02:04:31.257 --> 02:04:35.078]   country for the past week and we didn't realize that they were there for four days.
[02:04:35.078 --> 02:04:36.638]  Now those planes are going to leave.
[02:04:36.638 --> 02:04:39.398]   What little planes we have now are going to leave to go help them in Taiwan.
[02:04:39.398 --> 02:04:40.398]  I totally agree.
[02:04:40.398 --> 02:04:44.037]  We're being set up for an absolute fall, Dano.
[02:04:44.037 --> 02:04:45.398]  And Mr. Kim in North Korea.
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:46.181]  Chris in Illinois, go ahead.
[02:04:46.241 --> 02:04:47.742]  Hi Alex, how's it going?
[02:04:47.782 --> 02:04:48.142]  My name's Chris.
[02:04:48.162 --> 02:04:49.643]  Just calling in to tell you a little story.
[02:04:49.503 --> 02:04:53.882]   you try to touch China. We are in trouble Alex people need to wake up and people
[02:04:53.882 --> 02:04:57.083]   need to stick together we need to get the word out and people need to get it.
[02:04:57.083 --> 02:05:02.803]   I appreciate you and I agree with you. Chris in Illinois go ahead.
[02:05:02.803 --> 02:05:07.923]   How's it going my name's Chris just calling in to tell you a little story.
[02:05:07.923 --> 02:05:16.443]   It's quite interesting about it was 2021 and we were in South Dakota Sioux Falls
[02:05:17.251 --> 02:05:21.012]  And I went to, it was like their little park over there.
[02:05:21.052 --> 02:05:23.393]  It's kind of like a tourist attraction called The Falls.
[02:05:24.433 --> 02:05:26.393]  And we were just walking around.
[02:05:26.413 --> 02:05:35.215]  It blew clear day, you know, and I look up at the sky and there's this F-16 that came out of the airport right next to where we were at.
[02:05:36.115 --> 02:05:42.162]   And it flew like almost straight up and Um, we look up and we're like, what is it, what is it going after?
[02:05:42.222 --> 02:05:42.862]  Where is it going?
[02:05:43.122 --> 02:05:51.326]  And, uh, it ended up, like, we, we, we lost track of that, but we saw this, this, like, exactly what the, um, the spy balloons look like.
[02:05:52.067 --> 02:05:53.127]  It looked exactly like that.
[02:05:53.207 --> 02:05:54.848]  Sitting up there in the sky, not moving.
[02:05:55.409 --> 02:06:01.732]  We, we just kept an eye on it for like an hour, and it stayed there, and then we lost track of it, forgot about it.
[02:06:01.832 --> 02:06:07.115]  Next day, we, uh, wake up in a hotel room, we look out, and it's still in the sky the next day.
[02:06:07.917 --> 02:06:09.018]  And it was just really weird.
[02:06:09.038 --> 02:06:17.126]  We didn't think much of it at the time, but now that we've seen all this stuff happen with, you know, the balloons and whatnot, it's kind of just odd.
[02:06:17.226 --> 02:06:19.288]  And you look at it and you're like, wow, that actually was happening.
[02:06:19.328 --> 02:06:21.610]  Well, sir, people just see the balloons and they get upset about it.
[02:06:21.630 --> 02:06:23.652]  There's satellites everywhere scanning what we're doing.
[02:06:23.672 --> 02:06:27.776]  And so it's very healthy that people are starting to actually look at this and be concerned about it.
[02:06:27.796 --> 02:06:28.617]  I appreciate your call.
[02:06:29.037 --> 02:06:30.338]  Matt in New York, you're on the air.
[02:06:30.379 --> 02:06:30.599]  Go ahead.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.241]  Yo, what's up everybody?
[02:06:33.621 --> 02:06:37.723]  Instead of running around like Chicken Little with our heads cut off, why don't we make a plan?
[02:06:38.424 --> 02:06:42.706]  This country got hijacked by evil corporations, so why don't the people incorporate?
[02:06:43.086 --> 02:06:46.046]  We'll all get our membership cards, right?
[02:06:46.046 --> 02:06:48.326]  We'll incorporate, we'll start small.
[02:06:48.326 --> 02:06:51.765]  We'll go after January 6th, freeing those people.
[02:06:51.765 --> 02:06:53.605]  We'll concentrate everything on that.
[02:06:53.605 --> 02:06:58.405]   And also exposing the COVID lie and prosecuting all the people and
[02:06:58.405 --> 02:06:59.686]  holding them accountable.
[02:06:59.686 --> 02:07:00.445]  That'll be the first thing.
[02:07:00.445 --> 02:07:04.726]   And eventually, by incorporating, we'll create our own currency.
[02:07:04.726 --> 02:07:09.206]   We'll eventually divert all our tax money directly to an open,
[02:07:09.206 --> 02:07:13.925]   transparent fund, eliminate all the corruption, and make these people obsolete.
[02:07:14.072 --> 02:07:19.174]  But let's start this instead of running around and going, I told you so, while we're all getting killed.
[02:07:19.474 --> 02:07:20.595]  Because this is out of control.
[02:07:20.615 --> 02:07:21.035]  No, I hear you.
[02:07:21.055 --> 02:07:24.796]  But the good news is we have to first identify there's a corporate world government that's out to get us.
[02:07:25.136 --> 02:07:25.737]  We're doing that.
[02:07:26.477 --> 02:07:28.278]  We already identified them, Mr. Jones.
[02:07:28.118 --> 02:07:32.358]   cutting off pipelines, cutting off oil production, brainwashing our children.
[02:07:32.358 --> 02:07:35.917]   We're identifying who's doing it, we're identifying their policies, and we're
[02:07:35.917 --> 02:07:40.418]   educating the public to oppose the policies. We already identified them, Mr.
[02:07:40.418 --> 02:07:45.398]   Jones. No, no, you're awake, Matt. A lot of other folks aren't awake yet. They're
[02:07:45.398 --> 02:07:50.477]   ready for it, though. The tree has been watered with my blood, with everyone's
[02:07:50.477 --> 02:07:53.837]  blood that worked at 9/11.
[02:07:51.823 --> 02:07:53.304]  It has enough blood of patriots.
[02:07:53.684 --> 02:07:55.665]  It's time we get some blood of tyrants on there.
[02:07:55.905 --> 02:07:56.225]  Alright?
[02:07:56.745 --> 02:08:00.246]  Why don't we start a corporation live on this show for the American people?
[02:08:00.867 --> 02:08:02.768]  Open, transparent funds.
[02:08:02.888 --> 02:08:05.049]  50% goes to the operational aspect.
[02:08:05.169 --> 02:08:06.029]  50% goes to the people.
[02:08:06.309 --> 02:08:07.089]  And we start going.
[02:08:07.229 --> 02:08:10.551]  Because presidency and all this stuff means jack squat.
[02:08:10.971 --> 02:08:14.293]  Hey man, I'm just trying to keep this show on the air, but I hear what you're saying.
[02:08:14.333 --> 02:08:17.755]  It's easy to imagine stuff, it's harder to do it, but we're trying right now.
[02:08:18.355 --> 02:08:20.356]  Adrian in Arizona, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:08:22.117 --> 02:08:24.038]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:08:24.058 --> 02:08:28.400]  I have a question in regards to the spike protein.
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:37.305]  Have you done any research as far as it leading to what's called an endothelial disease?
[02:08:37.925 --> 02:08:39.846]  Essentially, it's going to make us all old.
[02:08:40.918 --> 02:08:42.778]  Yeah, it cuts off our DNA.
[02:08:43.059 --> 02:08:46.119]  It breaks the DNA chain and accelerates aging.
[02:08:46.699 --> 02:08:47.419]  It does so much.
[02:08:47.459 --> 02:08:48.960]  It causes cancer, blood clots.
[02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:50.460]  I mean, it's a total weapon.
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:51.920]  Yes, Alex.
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:09:03.843]  The only thing is that there's a few scientists out there and doctors that believe that regardless if you've been vaccinated or unvaccinated, so long that you've been exposed, that you've had COVID, you will end up with this.
[02:09:05.383 --> 02:09:06.143]  No, I agree.
[02:09:06.223 --> 02:09:09.464]  It's a bioweapon for depopulation and sterilization.
[02:09:10.441 --> 02:09:14.504]  So, even the people that have been unvaccinated, how do we protect ourselves?
[02:09:14.784 --> 02:09:16.206]  Is there a way?
[02:09:16.406 --> 02:09:18.527]  That's the big question I've had a lot of doctors on.
[02:09:19.108 --> 02:09:27.915]  Drink a lot of water, get sunshine, eat healthy food, take ivermectin in cycles so it can cause liver problems, and you can flush this crap out.
[02:09:27.975 --> 02:09:28.695]  You can mitigate it.
[02:09:29.696 --> 02:09:31.758]  What about things like NAC?
[02:09:32.218 --> 02:09:36.762]  No, I've had Mercola on, and I've had Mukkola on.
[02:09:36.802 --> 02:09:37.542]  They said the same thing.
[02:09:37.622 --> 02:09:38.083]  NAC.
[02:09:38.103 --> 02:09:39.484]  I took NAC this morning.
[02:09:40.492 --> 02:09:46.154]  What would be the purpose of the vaccine if just this, just COVID did the same thing?
[02:09:46.234 --> 02:09:47.534]  Why, why the push?
[02:09:47.554 --> 02:09:55.637]  Because if you look at the numbers, the shot is dozens of times worse than the actual disease, because your body is so powerful, it learns how to defeat it.
[02:09:56.497 --> 02:10:01.999]  And so they trick people to then take the shot, which then causes mutations, and then they become incubators for it.
[02:10:02.099 --> 02:10:02.940]  I appreciate your call.
[02:10:03.300 --> 02:10:04.800]  All right, I can't get to the other callers.
[02:10:05.961 --> 02:10:06.941]  I tried to get to everybody.
[02:10:07.878 --> 02:10:09.139]  We got to like 30 calls today.
[02:10:09.159 --> 02:10:09.999]  We did a pretty good job.
[02:10:10.499 --> 02:10:17.823]  But the next segment, I want to hit the vaccine news, so-called vaccine news, and then hand the baton to our guest hosts that are taking over.
[02:10:18.224 --> 02:10:20.625]  And then in one hour from now, Owen Troyer, 3 p.m.
[02:10:20.665 --> 02:10:21.545]  Central, takes over.
[02:10:22.666 --> 02:10:24.407]  I really appreciate all of your support.
[02:10:25.367 --> 02:10:28.709]  We'll go to break and come back with the rest of the story.
[02:10:30.630 --> 02:10:33.272]  All right, final segment before our guest hosts take over.
[02:10:34.824 --> 02:10:36.345]  Let's go over these headlines right now.
[02:10:36.365 --> 02:10:44.391]  WHO convenes urgent meeting over outbreak of deadly Marburg virus, which they've been hyping forever, will kill everybody.
[02:10:44.411 --> 02:10:55.580]  WHO convenes urgent meeting over outbreak of Marburg virus, one of the world's deadliest viruses that kills 90% of patients and has no cure.
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:10:57.481]  So they're going to hold us hostage.
[02:10:58.382 --> 02:11:00.604]  And if you submit, you'll be a slave or die.
[02:11:02.691 --> 02:11:10.436]  Cancer-causing viruses use a human protein, similar to the spike protein, to evade the innate immune response.
[02:11:10.476 --> 02:11:11.757]  And what do we be injected with?
[02:11:13.598 --> 02:11:14.799]  The very same spike protein.
[02:11:17.941 --> 02:11:26.386]  Continuing, Rand Paul, Senator Paul introduces bill to halt funding for hospitals denying care to the unvaccinated.

[02:12:43.666 --> 02:12:50.489]  Media claims 30% increase in heart attacks deaths for young people due to not taking COVID vaccines or wearing masks.
[02:12:50.609 --> 02:12:50.949]  Yes.
[02:12:51.550 --> 02:12:52.170]  Wear a mask.
[02:12:52.190 --> 02:12:53.070]  Don't have your heart attack.
[02:12:53.350 --> 02:12:53.991]  Take your shot.
[02:12:54.031 --> 02:12:54.691]  Have a heart attack.
[02:12:55.071 --> 02:12:55.832]  Yelp professor.

[02:12:59.633 --> 02:13:00.414]  Only solution.
[02:13:01.974 --> 02:13:04.536]  Teen girls engulfed in sadness and violence.
[02:13:04.556 --> 02:13:07.437]  New report finds mass suicide due to lockdowns.

[02:13:11.383 --> 02:13:16.285]  Australian regulators concealed fatal vaccine-induced myocarditis from the public.
[02:13:18.826 --> 02:13:23.308]  And it goes on and on and on.

[02:14:01.077 --> 02:14:02.037]  Return to the city.
[02:14:02.137 --> 02:14:04.459]  Living in the country can cause heart attacks.
[02:14:05.779 --> 02:14:06.540]  Total quackery.
[02:14:07.711 --> 02:14:13.395]  Why common cold symptoms may seem worse than before the pandemic because it's causing mutations and killing people.
[02:14:14.096 --> 02:14:15.757]  Oh, you're dying because the cold's worse.
[02:14:16.198 --> 02:14:16.918]  You took your shot.
[02:14:16.998 --> 02:14:18.019]  Now your immune system's gone.
[02:14:20.881 --> 02:14:26.305]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[02:14:28.387 --> 02:14:29.688]  National Post out of Canada.
[02:14:29.728 --> 02:14:31.089]  The hunt for unvaccinated blood.
[02:14:31.429 --> 02:14:32.330]  People demanding it.
[02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:44.869]  Huge new market.

[02:15:01.862 --> 02:15:05.943]  Protect us from the children, give them the poison shot immediately.
[02:15:07.276 --> 02:15:14.005]  All right, our guest hosts take over straight ahead, and in 55 minutes, Owen Schroyer takes over.

[02:15:19.111 --> 02:15:20.032]  I appreciate you all.
[02:15:20.052 --> 02:15:20.853]  I want to thank the crew.
[02:15:20.994 --> 02:15:22.994]  We'll be right back.

[02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:48.951]  What's going on, man?
[02:15:49.171 --> 02:15:49.952]  Good to see you.
[02:15:50.312 --> 02:15:53.235]  Hey, I really liked that work you did on the AI piece.
[02:15:53.415 --> 02:15:54.656]  I'm going to use that on the show today.
[02:15:54.716 --> 02:15:55.757]  Right on, I worked hard on that.
[02:15:55.957 --> 02:16:00.761]  I'm working on another project, so I'm going to be up late again tonight, and I was hoping you had some Brain Force Plus.
[02:16:01.742 --> 02:16:04.624]  Oh, um, no.
[02:16:05.545 --> 02:16:06.466]  No, nothing.
[02:16:06.846 --> 02:16:08.846]  What about Brain Force Ultra?
[02:16:08.846 --> 02:16:10.846]  Ummmmmm...
[02:16:10.846 --> 02:16:14.846]  No.
[02:16:14.846 --> 02:16:16.546]  Hmm.
[02:16:16.597 --> 02:16:16.857]  Okay.
[02:16:18.279 --> 02:16:18.840]  Thanks anyway.
[02:16:19.020 --> 02:16:23.125]  Good luck with that project though!

[02:16:32.168 --> 02:16:40.168]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:16:39.869 --> 02:16:43.431]  You are live with Councillor Spin Meteor as we geo-engineer this, the fourth hour.
[02:16:43.531 --> 02:16:44.111]  I'm Calum Alp.
[02:16:44.371 --> 02:16:45.412]  And I'm Hannah Spera.
[02:16:45.712 --> 02:16:48.093]  Sit tight because this is a packed hour.
[02:16:48.634 --> 02:16:52.076]  We are going to start this segment with a few videos.
[02:16:52.156 --> 02:16:57.619]  We also are going to bring on our guest in the next segment, Diana Uyanovich Shishwaka.
[02:16:57.939 --> 02:17:05.343]  She is the senator from Romania that has been calling out the deep state in regards to the earthquake over in Turkey.
[02:17:05.843 --> 02:17:07.624]  So, let's set this up.
[02:17:07.664 --> 02:17:13.587]  We're talking about geoengineering, HAARP, weather modification, trying to give you a big picture, put it into perspective.
[02:17:13.847 --> 02:17:16.928]  You'll see that players like Bill Gates, of course, are involved.
[02:17:17.248 --> 02:17:20.650]  So, let's play that first video, the geoengineering and weather modification.
[02:17:21.803 --> 02:17:24.465]  What do you do if you live in the middle of the desert and need water?
[02:17:24.965 --> 02:17:25.686]  You make it rain!
[02:17:26.146 --> 02:17:28.949]  Scientists in Dubai can now literally modify their weather.
[02:17:29.289 --> 02:17:35.214]  This technology could change the world as we know it, but will controlling the weather be used for good or for evil?
[02:17:35.714 --> 02:17:44.481]  In July of 2021, the United Arab Emirates National Center of Meteorology released a video showing a rainstorm that had been created using weather-modifying technology.
[02:17:44.861 --> 02:17:47.622]  How did they make it rain in the desert, you might ask?
[02:17:48.023 --> 02:17:54.426]  Scientists in Dubai used high-powered lasers and other advanced technology that were mounted to drones to make the rain fall.
[02:17:54.526 --> 02:17:59.709]  In Santa Barbara County, home to one of the longest-running cloud seeding operations in the country.
[02:18:00.329 --> 02:18:06.792]  We've got some ground-based cloud seeding equipment right here and we're going to get to hear all about how it works and see it in action.
[02:18:06.972 --> 02:18:12.015]  Another example is the array of technologies, often referred to collectively as geoengineering.
[02:18:12.735 --> 02:18:16.096]  That potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change.
[02:18:17.117 --> 02:18:22.519]  One that has gained my personal attention is Stratospheric Aerosol Injection, or SAI.
[02:18:23.279 --> 02:18:30.442]  A method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do.
[02:18:31.698 --> 02:18:42.147]  An SAI program could limit global temperature increases, reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures, and providing the world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels.
[02:18:43.008 --> 02:18:51.295]  Meanwhile, Bill Gates is backing the first high-altitude experiment of one radical climate change solution, creating a massive chemical cloud that could cool the Earth.
[02:18:51.916 --> 02:18:54.959]  It's called solar geoengineering, and it's highly controversial.
[02:18:57.439 --> 02:19:07.745]  How long will it be that countries keep experiencing these climate impacts before someone gets desperate and says, hey, we need to cool the planet with solar geoengineering?
[02:19:08.506 --> 02:19:09.566]  It would look something like this.
[02:19:10.107 --> 02:19:16.190]  Thousands of planes would fly very high and use nozzles to inject millions of tons of light-reflecting particles into the stratosphere.
[02:19:16.651 --> 02:19:22.374]  It would create a thin chemical cloud of those particles around the whole planet, blocking some sunlight from reaching the surface.
[02:19:22.854 --> 02:19:25.696]  It would mimic a giant volcanic eruption, which we know cools the Earth.
[02:19:27.836 --> 02:19:34.922]  Bill Gates is among a dozen individual donors and 14 foundations backing the first stratospheric solar geoengineering experiment out of Harvard.
[02:19:35.363 --> 02:19:38.926]  It's called Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment, or SCOPEX.
[02:19:39.827 --> 02:19:50.336]  A high-altitude balloon will lift instruments about 20 kilometers into the stratosphere, where it will release less than 2 kilograms of different naturally occurring chemicals, like calcium carbonate and sulfates.
[02:19:50.977 --> 02:19:52.018]  Wait, what?
[02:19:52.538 --> 02:19:53.559]  That balloon looks familiar.
[02:19:55.180 --> 02:19:55.520]  Aha!
[02:19:55.861 --> 02:19:57.421]  So that's why there's so many balloons.
[02:19:58.602 --> 02:20:02.403]  William Cohen, Secretary of Defense under Bill Clinton, said this in 1997.
[02:20:04.264 --> 02:20:13.128]  Others are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes, remotely, through the use of electromagnetic waves.
[02:20:14.009 --> 02:20:18.631]  In 1983, I did radio tomography with 30 watts, looking for oil in the ground.
[02:20:19.151 --> 02:20:23.253]  I found 26 oil wells over a nine-state area.
[02:20:24.033 --> 02:20:28.758]  And 100% of the time was accurate with just 30 watts of power beaming straight into solid rock.
[02:20:30.260 --> 02:20:32.803]  Harp uses a billion watts.
[02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:37.122]  Beam straight into the ionosphere for experiments.
[02:20:37.642 --> 02:20:41.886]  Picture these strings on the piano as layers of the earth.
[02:20:42.546 --> 02:20:44.127]  Each one has its own frequency.
[02:20:45.008 --> 02:20:52.093]  What we used to do is beam radio waves into the ground, and it would vibrate any strings that were present in the ground.
[02:20:52.293 --> 02:20:57.877]  We might get a sound back like... And we'd say, that's natural gas.
[02:20:59.759 --> 02:21:01.060]  We might get a sound back like...
[02:21:02.762 --> 02:21:04.162]  And we say that's crude oil.
[02:21:04.563 --> 02:21:07.063]  We were able to identify each frequency.
[02:21:07.524 --> 02:21:10.885]  We accomplished this with just 30 watts of radio power.
[02:21:11.845 --> 02:21:18.867]  If you do this with a billion watts, the vibrations are so violent that the entire piano would shake.
[02:21:19.367 --> 02:21:20.948]  In fact, the whole house would shake.
[02:21:21.467 --> 02:21:26.587]   In fact, the vibrations could be so severe underground, that could even cause an earthquake.
[02:21:26.587 --> 02:21:31.587]  [Earthquake sounds]
[02:21:31.587 --> 02:21:36.386]  So we know the science is there.
[02:21:36.383 --> 02:21:37.923]  It is not a conspiracy.
[02:21:37.943 --> 02:21:42.805]  HAARP and geoengineering are technologies that are being rolled out around the country.
[02:21:43.245 --> 02:21:47.446]  Now we want to set this up as well in terms of the Turkey geopolitical situation.
[02:21:47.986 --> 02:21:51.027]  We've also got this next clip just so you get a bit of a background.
[02:21:51.047 --> 02:21:56.789]  It is the BAUM report and we just want to share this with you before we bring the Senator on in the next segment.
[02:21:56.829 --> 02:21:58.730]  So let's roll that clip so you've got the context.
[02:21:59.250 --> 02:22:07.399]  At the end of January 2023, talks between Turkish President Erdogan and the Swedish government detonated.
[02:22:08.140 --> 02:22:16.049]  So you will let terror organizations run wild on your avenues and streets and then expect our support for getting into NATO?
[02:22:16.649 --> 02:22:17.610]  That's not happening.
[02:22:19.332 --> 02:22:26.195]  In order to be accepted into NATO, Sweden and Finland as well needed the vote from Turkey.
[02:22:26.656 --> 02:22:35.340]  But talks disintegrated after a Swedish-Danish politician set fire to the Koran in front of the Turkish embassy in Stockholm.
[02:22:35.729 --> 02:22:43.915]  On Saturday, Rasmus Paludin, head of a far-right Danish party, held a protest in front of Turkey's embassy in Stockholm.
[02:22:44.936 --> 02:22:48.439]  The Swedish-Danish national set fire to the Koran.
[02:22:48.639 --> 02:22:51.901]  That has put Sweden's NATO application in jeopardy.
[02:22:52.181 --> 02:22:59.407]  Accession to the military alliance must be approved unanimously by member states, including Turkey.
[02:22:59.827 --> 02:23:12.619]  After Erdogan's declaration, Turkey and northern Syria were devastated by a series of earthquakes in southern Turkey, with a death toll that has reached well over 11,000 people.
[02:23:12.799 --> 02:23:20.326]  Turkey is no stranger to earthquakes, the majority of them occurring in the eastern and western portions of the country.
[02:23:20.525 --> 02:23:28.725]   But strange anomalies occurred just before the earthquakes, leading many to question whether a HAARP weapon may have
[02:23:28.725 --> 02:23:36.584]   been used to punish the Turkish government for failing to tow the line of NATO's New World Order overlords.
[02:23:36.584 --> 02:23:45.985]  And we will be back after the break shortly.
[02:23:46.058 --> 02:23:52.463]  But before we cut to the break, we want to bring your attention to the speech that you can find in full.
[02:23:52.983 --> 02:23:55.586]  We did a special report a few days ago.
[02:23:55.666 --> 02:23:58.008]  We've got the poster there now before we can bring that up.
[02:23:58.428 --> 02:24:11.699]  So that was Samantha Edwards doing a special report on the earthquake, on the geopolitical situation, on the fact that HAARP was most probably used in this earthquake in Turkey and Syria.
[02:24:12.379 --> 02:24:15.701]  And it is a retaliation from the Deep State.
[02:24:16.221 --> 02:24:20.483]  Check out our channel here on Band.Video, the Counterspin channel.
[02:24:21.044 --> 02:24:22.965]  It's a very good report by Samantha Edwards.
[02:24:23.405 --> 02:24:25.826]  And at the end, you can watch the full speech.
[02:24:25.886 --> 02:24:35.571]  We're not going to play the full speech in this fourth hour, but we're going to have Diana on shortly because her speech, Kelvin, was absolutely monumental.
[02:24:35.771 --> 02:24:36.372]  It certainly was.
[02:24:36.412 --> 02:24:38.474]  She's certainly not backwards in coming forward.
[02:24:38.515 --> 02:24:40.958]  She's one of the most fined Senators there is.
[02:24:40.978 --> 02:24:46.104]  I think she said €30,000 to date because she will not shut up.
[02:24:46.164 --> 02:24:48.667]  She will not sit down and she calls it how she sees it.
[02:24:48.707 --> 02:24:50.750]  Yep, no COVID compliance from her.
[02:24:51.370 --> 02:24:56.430]   She is known as the Xena Warrior Princess over there in Romania.
[02:24:56.430 --> 02:25:00.830]   So that's her connection to New Zealand because of course that was filmed down under.
[02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:06.209]   Now at the end of our time here on the Alex Jones Show today, we are going to actually
[02:25:06.209 --> 02:25:12.530]   show you some of the major weather occurrences that we've been having because Auckland alone,
[02:25:12.530 --> 02:25:19.150]   our biggest city, has had 50% of its annual rain in only the last 45 days.
[02:25:19.150 --> 02:25:24.409]   So there are a lot of questions being asked here in New Zealand about what weather manipulation
[02:25:24.409 --> 02:25:26.650]  technologies could be used here as well.
[02:25:26.650 --> 02:25:30.809]   It's been going on for a long time, 1944, 1945, you will find them in the archives here
[02:25:30.809 --> 02:25:34.290]  in New Zealand and of course San Diego over in California.
[02:25:34.276 --> 02:25:35.337]  About Project Seal.
[02:25:35.717 --> 02:25:41.819]  We're back in World War Two, they were letting off detonations five miles from the coast to create many tsunamis.
[02:25:42.419 --> 02:25:44.120]  They have since perfected their technology.
[02:25:44.560 --> 02:26:01.386]  So everything you can start questioning now, question all the earthquakes that happen around you, question the weather that happens around you, because do you notice when we told people that once the COVID con started, the narrative started collapsing and it was all to a push to get people jabbed and that's what's causing the deaths?
[02:26:02.627 --> 02:26:03.769]  The same thing goes for the weather.
[02:26:03.809 --> 02:26:12.662]  They're going to ramp up climate change and that's going to be the excuse for the New World Order to come marching on in because you're all going to be, once again, want to be saved from the phantom menace.
[02:26:13.563 --> 02:26:15.987]  So keep it locked right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:16.007 --> 02:26:19.997]   When we come back, The Senator from Romania will be joining us.
[02:26:20.278 --> 02:26:23.538]  You're back live with the Alex Jones Show, California Media reporting.
[02:26:23.578 --> 02:26:25.499]  Now we're going to drill down to the nitty-gritty.
[02:26:25.519 --> 02:26:32.100]  We're going to bring the Romanian Senator on shortly, but first... We are going to play a segment of her mind-blowing speech.
[02:26:32.300 --> 02:26:45.543]  It literally kept us up in the middle of the night this week to hear a Senator and a public elected official over there in Romania actually saying that HAARP technology could have been used in this Turkey earthquake.
[02:26:45.563 --> 02:26:48.544]   So let's play that My political statement is titles.
[02:26:48.363 --> 02:26:51.363]  we'll come back with Diana Jojanovic-Szczeszczak.
[02:26:51.363 --> 02:27:00.363]   My political statement is titles, people had to die and it's not over yet.
[02:27:00.363 --> 02:27:06.363]   Dear fellow senators, for three years we have been experiencing a real campaign of mass
[02:27:06.363 --> 02:27:11.363]   killing worldwide, either through alleged pandemics and the imminent need to inject
[02:27:11.363 --> 02:27:16.363]   untested vaccines that kill people, or through wars that reduce the world's population,
[02:27:16.363 --> 02:27:22.363]   but rearranges international politics, realigns power polarities and alters borders.
[02:27:22.882 --> 02:27:35.733]  We have lived to witness the production of earthquakes on command, which is actually an attack on Turkey by the greatest of the world, who totally disliked being set up by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the President of Turkey.
[02:27:35.833 --> 02:27:46.802]  Moreover, his position of neutrality and mediator in the Ukrainian-Russian war deeply disturbed them, especially since Turkey is the second great power from a military point of view within NATO.
[02:27:47.983 --> 02:28:01.152]  His position to block Sweden's accession to NATO, his speech in Davos, as well as the gesture of leaving in the middle of the press conference, defying Schwab, did not remain without an echo in the cold world of Leaders the World.
[02:28:01.172 --> 02:28:07.416]  But, no one thought that people would have to die, so many people, and in such a terrible way.
[02:28:08.576 --> 02:28:12.838]  And it's just a warning, because it wasn't the most populated area of Turkey.
[02:28:14.138 --> 02:28:34.125]  150 aftershocks of a devastating earthquake, the second larger than the first, without the existence of an epicenter, the area being artificially stimulated, geological weapons having existed for a very long time, being used so far without causing too many casualties, probably for experiments.
[02:28:34.165 --> 02:28:36.066]  Now, it has been put into practice.
[02:28:37.286 --> 02:28:45.810]  If we look carefully at the map of Turkey, we will see that it is furrowed by gas and oil pipelines, this being actually one of the goals, their destruction.
[02:28:46.951 --> 02:28:52.674]  But, 10 seconds before the occurrence of the so-called earthquake, the Turks closed these pipelines.
[02:28:53.914 --> 02:28:59.757]  In addition, 24 hours before the earthquake, 10 countries withdrew their ambassadors from Turkey.
[02:29:00.958 --> 02:29:11.371]  Five days before its occurrence, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a travel warning for Romanian citizens in Turkey, although there was no danger, as did other countries.
[02:29:12.533 --> 02:29:14.796]  By killing people, they served their interests.
[02:29:16.097 --> 02:29:22.483]  The maps shown on all the television channels show that there was no epicenter, but a line with thousands of earthquakes.
[02:29:23.684 --> 02:29:37.677]  The Turkish secret services are investigating a possible criminal intervention, read an involvement of another state in triggering the first earthquake, what followed later being a chain reaction after the destabilization of the tectonic plates in the region.
[02:29:38.858 --> 02:29:50.027]  It is very clear that President Erdogan was punished for his courage, dignity and honor and for his closeness to the Russian Federation, in fact a position of neutrality and mediation for peace.
[02:29:53.769 --> 02:29:58.511]  I would trade that one senator for every single politician we have in New Zealand.
[02:29:59.132 --> 02:30:01.493]  Yeah, we've got 120, so that's saying a lot.
[02:30:01.913 --> 02:30:06.995]  So not only is Diana Ceaușoacă a Romanian senator, she's also a lawyer.
[02:30:07.315 --> 02:30:10.317]  She founded the SOS political party and is their president.
[02:30:10.877 --> 02:30:22.863]  She fought for the freedom of people during the pandemic, giving Romanians a public voice and awakening consciences and helping citizens resist pressure to take this poisonous vaccination.
[02:30:23.543 --> 02:30:32.205]  Now, we'll bring up some photos of her as well, where she was in Parliament and she was famously wearing a dog muzzle.
[02:30:32.405 --> 02:30:37.806]  So, as to encourage people, obviously, not to follow the mask mandates.
[02:30:38.386 --> 02:30:44.748]  And as a result, there was a very small uptake of the compliance with the vaccination.
[02:30:45.208 --> 02:30:47.328]  So, welcome to the show, Diana.
[02:30:47.368 --> 02:30:51.509]  We are so grateful that you have been able to join us today.
[02:30:53.154 --> 02:30:55.075]  Hello, thank you for your invitation.
[02:30:56.536 --> 02:30:57.456]  I'm glad to hear it.
[02:30:57.496 --> 02:31:06.240]  Diana, I have to ask, was the translation, the English translation that was put over your speech, was it correct?
[02:31:06.421 --> 02:31:07.881]  And do you stand by those words?
[02:31:10.122 --> 02:31:11.823]  Of course it was correct.
[02:31:12.103 --> 02:31:14.344]  I have here my speech.
[02:31:16.565 --> 02:31:18.626]  And I follow your translation.
[02:31:18.847 --> 02:31:19.107]  Okay.
[02:31:19.387 --> 02:31:19.527]  Yeah.
[02:31:23.001 --> 02:31:23.281]  Got it.
[02:31:23.321 --> 02:31:25.542]  We'll put that up as well.
[02:31:26.742 --> 02:31:29.223]  I'm a lawyer and I work with evidence.
[02:31:29.943 --> 02:31:36.745]  I'm always assuming what I declare, especially since it was a political declaration.
[02:31:37.305 --> 02:31:42.227]  I'm a senator, so it's an official document in the Senate of Romania.
[02:31:43.267 --> 02:31:46.248]  It's recorded and available to the public.
[02:31:46.908 --> 02:31:48.949]  The translation is correct.
[02:31:50.078 --> 02:31:54.341]  It's part of my statement, it's not my entire statement.
[02:31:56.122 --> 02:32:04.008]  I did not make this statement without checking and analyzing very well the topic in general and each word of it.
[02:32:05.269 --> 02:32:20.599]   Hence the title of the statement, people had to die and it's not over yet because As it was the case also in the pandemic, I say plannedemic, it's not a pandemic, it's a plannedemic.
[02:32:21.620 --> 02:32:29.607]  It is about the destruction of tens of thousands of human life for the evil plans of the globalists.
[02:32:30.487 --> 02:32:36.453]  And tomorrow there are going to be millions of victims, unfortunately.
[02:32:36.473 --> 02:32:39.135]  You're right.
[02:32:39.915 --> 02:32:43.356]  Absolutely, and your speech has been going viral.
[02:32:44.476 --> 02:32:49.538]  It's just been absolutely phenomenal that, you know, a senator from Romania has come out so hard.
[02:32:49.838 --> 02:32:56.280]  Why did you, and I'm trying to speak slowly, yes, because I know our Kiwi accent is a little bit unusual.
[02:32:56.680 --> 02:33:00.221]  We think it's perfect, but for others we know it's harder to understand.
[02:33:00.902 --> 02:33:05.283]  What compelled you to make this speech in the first place?
[02:33:09.348 --> 02:33:12.089]  All my speeches are in this way.
[02:33:14.190 --> 02:33:27.614]  You can find in my senator files the most interventions in the plenary are in this way.
[02:33:28.234 --> 02:33:39.579]   That's why I'm the only parliamentarian in the democratic world sanctioned for political opinions and statements For three months.
[02:33:39.939 --> 02:33:53.370]  For three months, I couldn't represent the Senate because I told the truth about the pandemic and the anti-COVID vaccination that kills.
[02:33:54.430 --> 02:33:57.433]  And yes, it's real.
[02:33:57.613 --> 02:34:03.738]  I'm the most fined Romanian citizen for non-compliance with COVID laws.
[02:34:03.758 --> 02:34:04.598]  30,000 euros.
[02:34:08.192 --> 02:34:15.014]  But I succeeded to cancel all the sanctions in court.
[02:34:16.574 --> 02:34:18.775]  All my speeches are viral.
[02:34:18.815 --> 02:34:29.097]  Viral in Romania, in Europe, in South America, and now in North America and New Zealand.
[02:34:29.797 --> 02:34:30.918]  I am not a politician.
[02:34:31.838 --> 02:34:34.939]  I came for the civic fight.
[02:34:35.679 --> 02:34:36.299]  I'm a lawyer.
[02:34:37.651 --> 02:34:40.017]  I'm sensitive to the suffering of people.
[02:34:40.819 --> 02:34:53.230]   I do politics of soul and with my soul and Over 80% of Romanian people loves me and supports me.
[02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:54.791]  We're going to hold you there.
[02:34:54.831 --> 02:34:56.431]  Diana, please hold the line.
[02:34:56.511 --> 02:34:57.511]  We will be back after this.
[02:34:57.671 --> 02:34:59.271]  Don't go away here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:59.631 --> 02:35:05.152]   We're back live with the Alex Jones show with a Romanian senator who is calling it as she sees it and is absolutely
[02:35:05.152 --> 02:35:10.400]   convinced that the That it was an attack on Turkey. Not just a random set of
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:14.970]   earthquakes She mentioned in her speech that of course it had no epicenter.
[02:35:14.970 --> 02:35:19.912]   It was a long line of basically explosions of some form or another
[02:35:19.912 --> 02:35:27.072]   Welcome back again, Deanna if I can just ask you now you did mention in your speech that diplomats were withdrawn
[02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:35.551]   Just prior oil and gas pipelines shut down just prior this has all the all the hallmarks of having foreknowledge
[02:35:35.551 --> 02:35:41.751]   How many people do you know within Romania or the wider Europe that?
[02:35:41.751 --> 02:35:45.691]   Actually believe as you do that it was actually an attack on Turkey
[02:35:45.691 --> 02:35:55.691]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:35:47.900 --> 02:35:51.821]  A lot of people and political people.
[02:35:52.961 --> 02:36:00.804]  You know, I'm a senator, so I have access to some information that common people cannot access.
[02:36:01.857 --> 02:36:13.461]  People are now scared and are scared to believe what is happening before their eyes, because it is so serious and it blows up everything they know about the world and order.
[02:36:14.321 --> 02:36:24.485]  Many may have suspicions about this earth space, but very few have the courage and information to say this in public, especially fear.
[02:36:25.285 --> 02:36:32.477]   Not in the courage is It's not a quality of a politician.
[02:36:32.537 --> 02:36:40.083]  The courage is a quality of a common people who believe in God and who love people.
[02:36:40.743 --> 02:36:49.229]  I think that because my statement about you say harp, I would like to tell you something more.
[02:36:49.690 --> 02:36:51.030]  It's not only harp.
[02:36:51.991 --> 02:36:55.133]  There are geophysical weapons that we don't know.
[02:36:55.273 --> 02:36:57.175]  Harp is very old.
[02:36:57.864 --> 02:37:07.809]  Harp was invented 50 years ago, and one of my counsellors is a general who works with this kind of weapons.
[02:37:08.770 --> 02:37:31.509]   So I have spoken with him, and he told me that I have to get out of this political secretomany and to tell the people the truth, even if it would be very risky.
[02:37:32.129 --> 02:37:44.613]  This general, 20 years ago, wrote a book and the book name is Geophysical War, 20 years ago.
[02:37:45.094 --> 02:38:01.247]   His name is Emil Streinu, a great general, who now has, last year, had three Three times of trying to kill him.
[02:38:02.027 --> 02:38:02.647]  Three times.
[02:38:03.728 --> 02:38:09.670]  And I do know that he knows a lot of secrets.
[02:38:10.390 --> 02:38:20.474]  I know a lot of secrets, but if I would speak loud and clear, it would be an enormous shock.
[02:38:21.354 --> 02:38:32.729]   And I prefer to remain here at HAARP and Geophysical Weapons And yes, of course, my message was received and worldwide spread.
[02:38:32.829 --> 02:38:43.517]  There are many more who have understood what is really happening in the world and that plutocracy wants to turn us into guinea pigs.
[02:38:44.277 --> 02:38:56.046]  The tens of thousands of posts and comments and millions of views of my Senate statements on these geophysical weapons because, I repeat, it's not only HAARP.
[02:38:56.889 --> 02:39:03.630]  Indicate that the world is waking up and becoming aware of the dangers.
[02:39:07.271 --> 02:39:27.989]   If you should follow my Facebook page and someone to translate you all my statements and the statements for two days ago, you will see that I always said this kind of things.
[02:39:29.050 --> 02:39:34.791]  And all my colleagues from Senate are very afraid of me.
[02:39:35.091 --> 02:39:36.371]  They do not have courage.
[02:39:36.871 --> 02:39:52.035]  They have a lot of problems, panel problems, and they do not have the courage and your politicians also do not have the courage to tell this truth.
[02:39:53.315 --> 02:39:53.515]  Yeah.
[02:39:56.663 --> 02:39:59.425]  It's very dangerous, but I use misdanger.
[02:40:00.986 --> 02:40:03.908]  Absolutely, and you will be remembered for your courage.
[02:40:03.968 --> 02:40:16.518]  Now, just in this next four minutes, can you please explain to the world, you know, about some of these globalist players like George Soros and his cronies?
[02:40:17.038 --> 02:40:22.803]  What are they actually doing in your region of the world and how are they influencing things?
[02:40:25.447 --> 02:40:28.388]  Yeah, George Soros is my friend.
[02:40:30.469 --> 02:40:36.731]  Yeah, he's my best friend, he's my best enemy, and he also thinks about me in this way.
[02:40:36.751 --> 02:40:56.840]   At this moment, the Deep States and George Soros are making a war in our region, refusing through their puppets and peace negotiations any peaceful solution, and attacking anyone who is trying to avoid escalation of the conflict on And even a larger scale.
[02:40:57.581 --> 02:41:06.205]  Anyone who talks about peace in Romania or in Europe or all over the world becomes an enemy of the people.
[02:41:06.365 --> 02:41:13.048]  Anyone who proposes a peaceful solution is assimilated to terrorists or traitors.
[02:41:13.888 --> 02:41:15.509]  That is happening with me too.
[02:41:16.550 --> 02:41:23.233]  Look at what happened to Turkey because Erdogan tried to mediate the peace.
[02:41:23.911 --> 02:41:28.033]  The Deep State become mad when hears the word peace.
[02:41:28.733 --> 02:41:38.618]  One of the most beautiful words on this planet is peace and began to attack the peacemakers in every possible way.
[02:41:39.058 --> 02:41:49.523]  But let's remember what says the New Testament, blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of God.
[02:41:50.223 --> 02:41:59.930]   So if us, Those who ask for peace are the children of God, whose children are those who ask for war.
[02:42:00.370 --> 02:42:03.231]  I told you there are the children of Satan.
[02:42:03.872 --> 02:42:12.816]  This is a proof that they are afraid of us or for us because we are speaking the truth.
[02:42:12.896 --> 02:42:15.457]  We have the courage to speak the truth.
[02:42:16.157 --> 02:42:20.079]  Anyone who speaks of peace is put on the pole of infamy.
[02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:23.861]  and is attacked from all sides.
[02:42:24.461 --> 02:42:26.822]  This is what happened also in Romania.
[02:42:28.742 --> 02:42:38.805]  I'm glad to tell you here, the first movement for peace in the world was mine.
[02:42:38.625 --> 02:42:52.384]   in 26 February 2021, 2022, after I don't know, three or four days about after the war began.
[02:42:52.384 --> 02:43:00.745]   And it is a unique initiative named Neutrality for Romania, the Peace from Bucharest, because
[02:43:00.745 --> 02:43:07.824]   I asked all the countries to come to Bucharest in our House of Parliament, which name is
[02:43:07.984 --> 02:43:22.728]  House of People, House of Romanian Nations is the second greatest build in the world after the Pentagon.
[02:43:23.428 --> 02:43:34.819]   So I said we have a lot of chambers come here and negotiate the peace because It's very nice for the Americans, for NATO.
[02:43:34.859 --> 02:43:46.143]  They are 10,000 kilometers far away from this place, but we are at hundreds of kilometers next to the war.
[02:43:46.623 --> 02:43:56.967]  So for me, it's not acceptable to have war next to me, next to my borders.
[02:43:58.601 --> 02:44:11.674]  The piece from Bucharest wasn't very nice, not even for the president of Romania, for the government from Romania.
[02:44:12.195 --> 02:44:30.337]   On 8 March 2022, I organized a protest in front of the government It is a day of a woman, it was a day of maternity, and a lot of people yelled at the government, stop what we need!
[02:44:30.557 --> 02:44:31.077]  Excellent!
[02:44:32.018 --> 02:44:38.120]  Diana, we are going to hold you there over to the next segment, and we'll continue this.
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:38.921]  Thank you.
[02:44:38.941 --> 02:44:40.982]  Right here, live on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:41.442 --> 02:44:41.962]  Don't miss it.
[02:44:42.681 --> 02:44:45.822]  And we're back for the final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:45.982 --> 02:44:51.063]  Stay tuned, at the top of the hour, Owen Troyer will be on with the War Room.
[02:44:51.503 --> 02:44:56.505]  Until then, we are still with Diana Shoshka.
[02:44:56.525 --> 02:44:58.025]  Apologies for that.
[02:44:58.365 --> 02:45:16.675]   She is, of course, the Romanian Senator and she was just telling us about how she had called for negotiations to end the war in the Ukraine and she'd had a peaceful protest Now, Diana, is there any final parting words you have for the people of the world and your plight in Romania?
[02:45:18.816 --> 02:45:20.638]  My message for the people of the world?
[02:45:20.658 --> 02:45:24.461]  Do not be scared.
[02:45:25.433 --> 02:45:25.673]  It is.
[02:45:26.174 --> 02:45:41.592]  And I would like, because you told me there are persons that don't believe that I'm real, that I don't exist, and I didn't say what you translated, I would like to tell them what I told in my statement.
[02:45:42.253 --> 02:45:48.457]  It is very clear to me that at this point, things at the international level have gotten out of hand.
[02:45:48.957 --> 02:45:52.759]  The fools are playing as God and they think they have won the game.
[02:45:53.100 --> 02:45:54.961]  They didn't won the game.
[02:45:55.741 --> 02:46:10.010]  Cause of these demanded and psychopathic people, because they are ill, who cause wars and cataclysms using unconventional weapons, we humans are just numbers they can get rid of.
[02:46:11.201 --> 02:46:47.434]   It is imperative that all the nations, the peoples of the world, rise up together, wake up from daily comfort and carelessness, and just like in the revolution of 1848, look out On Google, 1848, a very important revolution for liberty will begin the struggle for liberation from the yoke of the psychopaths, of demented people who steal our happiness and the beautiful world in that we live in.
[02:46:48.120 --> 02:47:26.244]   That's why I urge all of you who still want to live in a world of God and not of Satan, I urge you to rise up to fight, to a world revolt to free us all, and to destroy these enemies, because in this moment we are in the legitimate defense, and I tell you as a lawyer, Take the clause of Turkey, take the clause of Romania, take the clause of New Zealand, take the clause of USA, take the clause of Europe, take the clause of the God's people.
[02:47:26.704 --> 02:47:29.725]  Warning to the psychopaths of the world.
[02:47:30.586 --> 02:47:35.268]  If you need people to die, we need you to perish too.
[02:47:36.009 --> 02:47:37.709]  It's all or nothing.
[02:47:38.350 --> 02:47:49.030]   An eye for an eye and a tooth This is my message for the people all around the world.
[02:47:49.591 --> 02:47:50.632]  Don't be afraid.
[02:47:50.772 --> 02:47:51.633]  I'm not afraid.
[02:47:52.053 --> 02:47:52.954]  I am a mother.
[02:47:52.974 --> 02:47:55.135]  I have three kids.
[02:47:56.156 --> 02:48:06.124]  I have a lot of fight against Soros, against the state, against the government, against the police.
[02:48:06.705 --> 02:48:07.625]  I don't care.
[02:48:08.166 --> 02:48:10.648]  I will fight till the end.
[02:48:11.175 --> 02:48:14.016]  Because we will win!
[02:48:14.036 --> 02:48:25.300]  And we are going to steal you from Romania, and we're going to bring you here to New Zealand, and we can get rid of the sock puppets that we have down in Parasite Palace.
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:26.841]  They're laughingly called the Beehive.
[02:48:27.121 --> 02:48:29.381]  Thank you so much, Diana, for joining us.
[02:48:30.062 --> 02:48:31.442]  It's been a real great honour.
[02:48:31.522 --> 02:48:36.184]  Now we're going to finish off the show with a few comments about New Zealand.
[02:48:36.764 --> 02:48:38.405]  We hope to have you back on sometime.
[02:48:38.445 --> 02:48:39.185]  Thank you so much.
[02:48:40.046 --> 02:48:40.973]  Thank you very much.
[02:48:40.993 --> 02:48:42.382]  I will come with pleasure.
[02:48:44.011 --> 02:48:44.291]  Excellent.
[02:48:44.311 --> 02:48:44.872]  Looking forward to it.
[02:48:44.912 --> 02:48:45.792]  Appreciate that.
[02:48:46.092 --> 02:48:51.095]  Now, here in New Zealand, we're going to show you some of the sock puppets as well that we've got.
[02:48:51.255 --> 02:48:55.578]  Of course, many of you know that Jacinda Ardern, the former Prime Minister, is gone.
[02:48:55.958 --> 02:49:03.663]  Now, let's bring up the two images there that we've got of the two puppets, because this is our latest billboard that we wanted to show you.
[02:49:04.143 --> 02:49:07.005]  Of course, two wings of the same bird.
[02:49:07.165 --> 02:49:08.365]  Coming to a town near you.
[02:49:08.405 --> 02:49:09.286]  Yes, here we go.
[02:49:09.346 --> 02:49:10.827]  Tweedledum and Tweedledummer.
[02:49:11.086 --> 02:49:17.406]   That of course on the left is Chris Hipkins who is the leader of the left-leaning Labour Party and there on the
[02:49:17.406 --> 02:49:21.287]   right You have Chris Luxon who we requested
[02:49:21.287 --> 02:49:28.566]   personally last week if he could release the unredacted Pfizer contract and they are of course both playing to
[02:49:28.566 --> 02:49:37.055]   Schwab's tune there. He is of course the puppet master So look out for that if you are in New Zealand and you want
[02:49:37.055 --> 02:49:42.765]   to get a billboard out info at counterspinmedia.com We want to get these all around the country
[02:49:42.765 --> 02:49:49.287]   Now if you want to keep in the fight We have to put in a good shout out for InfoWarsStore.com
[02:49:49.287 --> 02:49:54.287]   at this point because of course they have some great products
[02:49:54.661 --> 02:49:59.823]  Their latest one to be restocked is, of course, for the first time in years, their Prebiotic Fibre.
[02:50:00.143 --> 02:50:00.683]  It's back.
[02:50:01.243 --> 02:50:02.423]  It's 40% off.
[02:50:02.863 --> 02:50:10.145]  Go and support them because they are fighting the tyranny as we are here at Counterspin and they need all the support they can get from you.
[02:50:10.205 --> 02:50:13.406]  So it's a win-win, 360-win situation there.
[02:50:13.806 --> 02:50:28.291]   Now, Kelvin, on our way out, shall we play some of the footage and speak over it as to the horrific Whether that New Zealand has been experiencing, it's summer down here if you don't know, we've had hail, we've had rain, let's get that B roll out.
[02:50:28.411 --> 02:50:38.435]  We've had deluges, we've had of course Cyclone Gabrielle has come through, some said it was going to be a nothing but it turned out to be more than a nothing, it was quite a something.
[02:50:39.395 --> 02:50:45.838]  People losing their homes underwater, even when the Army got deployed they lost one of their Unimogs.
[02:50:46.458 --> 02:50:47.959]  There's still some people missing.
[02:50:48.159 --> 02:50:55.304]  Unfortunately, we've lost two firefighters in the rescuing attempt, so our hearts go out to them and their families.
[02:50:56.885 --> 02:51:07.271]  And in the first round, which was actually just on about around the 28th of January, when the first deluge came, you know, there were, I think, three to four lives that went missing.
[02:51:08.032 --> 02:51:12.469]   What you're seeing here is very, very Unusual in some ways.
[02:51:12.529 --> 02:51:19.335]  I mean, of course, yes, we have floods, but I don't remember ever seeing these types of floods in my lifetime.
[02:51:19.355 --> 02:51:20.996]  Auckland, the biggest city.
[02:51:21.016 --> 02:51:28.402]  These are buses, what you're seeing here in Auckland, that were just completely driving with water in the water.
[02:51:28.422 --> 02:51:30.884]  This was an image that went viral here.
[02:51:31.508 --> 02:51:36.414]  Now bearing in mind, Auckland has been flooded previously, so it's not a new occurrence.
[02:51:36.474 --> 02:51:46.718]   What is new, of course, is because 30 years of Labour-linked local government Did not spend enough money in infrastructure, stormwater, etc.
[02:51:46.778 --> 02:51:57.085]  They have basically done a rack, pack and stack of the city, brought in a lot of people, but the existing infrastructure was not enough to take care of it.
[02:51:57.165 --> 02:52:01.368]  And if you're not looking after your pipes, nothing's going to flow.
[02:52:01.688 --> 02:52:19.040]   And this is one of the reasons why, of course, there's about $300 million missing from the Auckland Council budget at the departure of The Labour-connected Phil Goff and their City CEO, that needs to be investigated as well.
[02:52:19.700 --> 02:52:36.870]  Yes, and those images earlier were of supermarkets, the Auckland International Airport underwater, and in this last round this week of torrential rain on the East Coast, we've got major state highways being disconnected.
[02:52:37.509 --> 02:52:45.729]   from centres of, well major centres are being disconnected, people are being disconnected
[02:52:45.729 --> 02:52:51.268]   and the Prime Minister made a statement yesterday saying that the recovery is going to take
[02:52:51.268 --> 02:52:56.089]   years because this is really, really massive destruction Kelvin.
[02:52:56.089 --> 02:53:01.228]   It's the fastest way to bring in the, well the great reset isn't it?
[02:53:01.228 --> 02:53:06.388]   Let's just destroy a country and have everyone pushed into another area declaring those others
[02:53:06.388 --> 02:53:07.669]  is uninhabitable.
[02:53:07.905 --> 02:53:10.267]  Because New Zealanders would not have bought it otherwise.
[02:53:10.327 --> 02:53:12.988]  We have lived up to earthquakes.
[02:53:14.049 --> 02:53:16.090]  We've lived up in the past to tsunamis.
[02:53:16.471 --> 02:53:19.953]  We've lived up to this food shortages that are manufactured.
[02:53:20.433 --> 02:53:24.996]  I mean we're now questioning the Christchurch earthquake with the boats offshore.
[02:53:25.016 --> 02:53:28.338]  The Chinese boat that was here when all this stuff started.
[02:53:29.098 --> 02:53:35.159]  We've had radar blips showing that there's anomalies in the atmosphere just prior to all this happening.
[02:53:35.859 --> 02:53:39.460]  So for those who say where the wars don't exist, we've just proven they do.
[02:53:41.360 --> 02:53:48.341]  You've got a senator who's got contact with military and intelligence people who all say this is true.
[02:53:48.381 --> 02:53:49.622]  This is actually happening.
[02:53:49.942 --> 02:53:51.962]  It's a war on and they're after you.
[02:53:51.982 --> 02:53:54.702]  They've weaponized fear and they're using it against the people.
[02:53:55.783 --> 02:53:57.883]  We must weaponize hope and push back.
[02:53:58.527 --> 02:54:02.809]  Yes, and we are sending all our love and all our prayers to all of you Kiwis.
[02:54:02.889 --> 02:54:05.811]  This is just some of the latest footage that's been coming in.
[02:54:06.011 --> 02:54:07.312]  Absolutely horrific.
[02:54:07.612 --> 02:54:15.316]  You know, we've got a very small team here at Counterspin of volunteers and three of our team members have had no power for the last three days.
[02:54:15.616 --> 02:54:17.337]  Look, houses just full of mud.
[02:54:17.818 --> 02:54:20.979]  It's absolutely heartbreaking for so many of you out there.
[02:54:21.380 --> 02:54:27.583]   So hopefully you are able to get this broadcast At some point, but you know we have so much respect for you all.
[02:54:27.663 --> 02:54:33.086]  It's been such a hard time and we really thank you for your support.
[02:54:33.126 --> 02:54:42.010]  If you want to help Counterspin also go to Counterspinmedia.com and get out there and give us a donation because without your support we can't go on, Kelvin.
[02:54:42.331 --> 02:54:44.051]  And share, share, share, share.
[02:54:44.091 --> 02:54:45.592]  Shadowbanning is a real thing.
[02:54:45.632 --> 02:54:52.496]  You find it on InfoWars, you find it on Ban.video, Alex Jones, others who are doing the good fight and their amazing team.
[02:54:53.456 --> 02:55:01.819]  You've got to support these people otherwise the globalists will win, they will take and control the information and you will be none the wiser.
[02:55:02.059 --> 02:55:06.220]  Thanks for watching, stay tuned for Owen Schroer and we look forward to seeing you next time.
[02:55:06.480 --> 02:55:08.181]  And it's going to be epic.
[02:55:09.060 --> 02:55:11.379]  Keep up the fight people, we ain't lost yet.
[02:55:11.379 --> 02:55:14.880]  [music playing]
[02:55:15.880 --> 02:55:16.880]  [whoosh]
[02:55:16.880 --> 02:55:20.380]  [music playing]
[02:55:20.380 --> 02:55:23.880]  [music playing]
[02:55:23.880 --> 02:55:25.880]  Let's talk about things.
[02:55:25.947 --> 02:55:27.048]  You're a sponsor of the show.
[02:55:27.608 --> 02:55:28.328]  You support us.
[02:55:28.388 --> 02:55:32.829]  It's not the main reason I had you on today, but usually you're hard to even get to plug the products when you're on.
[02:55:33.229 --> 02:55:35.310]  But you've got so many great Made in America products.
[02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:39.331]  And if people go to your sites and use promo code Alex, they get even bigger discounts.
[02:55:39.731 --> 02:55:41.592]  But tell folks about this new pillow you've got.
[02:55:42.392 --> 02:55:44.013]  Yeah, this is a big announcement.
[02:55:44.093 --> 02:55:46.934]  When I invented my pillow, that was in 2004.
[02:55:46.974 --> 02:55:47.954]  It took a year to invent.
[02:55:48.515 --> 02:55:49.595]  Nothing ever changed.
[02:55:49.635 --> 02:55:51.896]  It was the best patented fill, the best.
[02:55:51.916 --> 02:55:55.577]  Remember, sleep is about height and staying there, and temperature.
[02:55:56.098 --> 02:56:04.081]  Well now, I found out about a year and a half ago about temperature regulating thread that's made here in the U.S.
[02:56:04.401 --> 02:56:10.084]   So I have this fabric made And I said, you know, let's make an exclusive MyPillow fabric.
[02:56:10.344 --> 02:56:12.225]  Let's see if it works with the great patented feel.
[02:56:12.665 --> 02:56:14.446]  I've slept on it now for two months.
[02:56:14.867 --> 02:56:16.588]  This stuff is cool to the touch.
[02:56:17.468 --> 02:56:19.869]  You're not going to be flipping that pillow to the cool side.
[02:56:20.330 --> 02:56:23.832]  It is the most, the best pillow in history just got even better.
[02:56:24.272 --> 02:56:26.193]  And we're doing the buy one, get one free.
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:38.910]  We just actually got these into production last week, and the commercial for it, it was one of our big movie commercials we made where the one in the mirror, that comes out in about 10 days.
[02:56:38.930 --> 02:56:46.877]  So you're getting them here, one of the first ones to get them in the country, and trust me, it brings sleep to a whole new level.
[02:56:47.177 --> 02:56:48.839]  They're absolutely the best pillow ever.
[02:56:49.819 --> 02:56:56.242]  You have great products, hundreds of great products, but more importantly, you're using the money to fight the New World Order fearlessly.
[02:56:56.262 --> 02:57:04.786]  That's why everybody should shop for their sheets and their pillows and their beds and their dog beds and their slippers and everything at MyPillow.com.
[02:57:04.866 --> 02:57:06.667]  You've got the great bathrobes, everything.
[02:57:07.027 --> 02:57:14.171]  And just use promo code to get the big discount, promo code A-L-E-X, and that keeps this show on air as well.
[02:57:17.799 --> 02:57:23.420]  If you go to OnlineHealthNow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at The Wellness Company.
[02:57:23.540 --> 02:57:27.381]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the company.
[02:57:27.421 --> 02:57:31.802]  I contribute like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[02:57:31.962 --> 02:57:39.324]  Far and away the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's Detoxification Supplement that features natokinase.
[02:57:39.424 --> 02:57:41.564]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[02:57:41.765 --> 02:57:47.406]   This one is the only Enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[02:57:47.446 --> 02:57:48.206]  This is very important.
[02:57:48.226 --> 02:57:53.047]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[02:57:53.267 --> 02:57:54.747]  People are low with the spike protein.
[02:57:54.767 --> 02:57:55.608]  They don't feel well.
[02:57:55.728 --> 02:57:57.348]  This is a potential solution.
[02:57:57.428 --> 02:58:00.409]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[02:58:00.489 --> 02:58:03.269]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[02:58:03.409 --> 02:58:04.410]  Isn't it interesting?
[02:58:04.770 --> 02:58:10.631]  Natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
