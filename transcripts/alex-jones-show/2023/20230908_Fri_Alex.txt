[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:17.383]  All of these governors and mayors see the crime and the people everywhere and the breakdown of society, and then they turn around and say, not here, and Eric Adams wants to ship them to Long Island.
[00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:25.669]  Yeah, let's take 100,000, that's what's in New York conservatively, the hotels are all full, you name it, they're putting them in luxury hotels.
[00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.912]  Here, let's ship 100,000 people and just throw them out on the street.
[00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:30.546]  In Rhode Island?
[00:00:31.547 --> 00:00:32.808]  Well, let's ship them up to Kingston!
[00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:34.689]  Or Rochester!
[00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:35.269]  Or Buffalo!
[00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.312]  That's the same thing over and over again, isn't it?
[00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.014]  But don't come to Martin's Vineyard one bus load!
[00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:45.276]  No, you're gone in one day!
[00:00:45.596 --> 00:00:46.797]  Get your ass outta here!
[00:00:47.277 --> 00:00:48.918]  You don't come to where Obama lives!
[00:00:49.578 --> 00:00:50.279]  No, sir!
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.121]  No, sir!
[00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:56.583]  Not in my backyard, in your backyard.
[00:00:56.903 --> 00:00:58.124]  And does it help the third world people?
[00:00:58.164 --> 00:00:58.365]  No.
[00:00:58.445 --> 00:00:59.706]  It lowers us to their level.
[00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:02.008]  Which is what Ross Perot said.
[00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:05.551]  He said, you pass this NAFTA and this can't be a giant second sound.
[00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:07.053]  You're not going to help Mexico.
[00:01:07.353 --> 00:01:09.535]  You're going to lower their level when this is all done as well and lower us.
[00:01:11.157 --> 00:01:12.658]  Higher standards will raise them up.
[00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:14.820]  Lower standards will lower us all.
[00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:17.183]  He said that 30 years ago.
[00:01:17.203 --> 00:01:19.225]  And he was absolutely right.
[00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.964]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:28.863 --> 00:01:30.863]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:30.863 --> 00:01:39.363]  It's Friday, September 8th, 2020.
[00:01:39.392 --> 00:01:41.334]  You're tuned in.
[00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:44.456]  The program the globalists fear the most.
[00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:45.917]  Massive news straight ahead.
[00:01:45.957 --> 00:01:47.959]  Stay with us.
[00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:50.861]  InfoWars.
[00:01:51.221 --> 00:01:52.102]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:01:52.422 --> 00:01:52.723]  Today.
[00:01:55.387 --> 00:01:58.069]  It's Friday, September 8, 2023.
[00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.831]  And we're not talking about conspiracy theories here today.
[00:02:03.792 --> 00:02:06.233]  We're not talking about theoretical things.
[00:02:06.274 --> 00:02:14.018]  We're not talking about things that are fiction or postulating possible futures.
[00:02:14.058 --> 00:02:22.003]  We're talking about what is known to be deployed that is being rolled out right now against humanity.
[00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:37.274]  And one of my greatest frustrations I've been on air 29 years is I'd read Pentagon documents that were public 25, 26 years ago about spider goats that are part spider that create body armor through their milk for the Pentagon for a giant project.
[00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:39.035]  And China has it as well.
[00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:44.357]  And callers would call in and say, there's no way we have goats spliced with spiders.
[00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:45.217]  That's just made up.
[00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:54.992]   It's this week they came out and said, yeah, we've created humanoids in the laboratory that don't have any There's no sperm or eggs involved or any parents.
[00:02:56.473 --> 00:02:57.773]  But we're not going to upset you.
[00:02:57.914 --> 00:02:58.434]  It's discreet.
[00:02:58.454 --> 00:03:01.656]  We're not going to show them to you.
[00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:04.937]  So, see, we don't have little great men from Mars landing, little green men.
[00:03:04.957 --> 00:03:10.741]  We don't have foreign aliens proven here, but we have alien life forms being created on Earth.
[00:03:10.821 --> 00:03:11.721]  So, here we are.
[00:03:13.742 --> 00:03:21.742]   On a special Friday transmission, the Alex Jones Show 2.0, exclusively at Steven Crowder and the Mug Club.
[00:03:21.742 --> 00:03:31.742]  [Whistle]
[00:03:31.742 --> 00:03:34.742]  Initiate launch phase.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.381]  Human resistance.
[00:03:38.122 --> 00:03:40.263]  Friday, September 8th, 2023.
[00:03:41.163 --> 00:03:43.084]  Broadcast the enemy fears.
[00:03:44.345 --> 00:03:46.386]  Because they fear the truth.
[00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:50.428]  And they fear our God.
[00:03:51.748 --> 00:03:54.830]  We've not forgotten the people of Lahaina, Maui.
[00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.331]  And we've got a rescue worker.
[00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:00.893]  A very well accredited, very accomplished individual.
[00:04:02.037 --> 00:04:09.381]  Who has been, lives there, and has been there for weeks, and he's ready to join us in the third hour to give us a breakdown on what really happened there.
[00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:12.723]  Look for that important interview two hours from now.
[00:04:14.224 --> 00:04:20.427]  In the meantime, the UN came out and said, okay, the variant's totally deadly, we need new controls right now.
[00:04:23.609 --> 00:04:27.311]  Schools all over the country are saying they get one case, they're shutting it a bunch of shut.
[00:04:29.366 --> 00:04:31.247]  New York system-wide mask.
[00:04:31.327 --> 00:04:31.887]  It's all back.
[00:04:32.387 --> 00:04:32.848]  D.C.
[00:04:33.008 --> 00:04:33.408]  all back.
[00:04:33.688 --> 00:04:33.928]  L.A.
[00:04:33.968 --> 00:04:34.528]  bringing it back.
[00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:37.130]  Told you they were.
[00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:45.414]  WHO sounds major alarm over concerning COVID wave coming this winter as deaths soar.
[00:04:45.634 --> 00:04:47.455]  Yeah, from the shots.
[00:04:48.195 --> 00:04:49.876]  Major new developments there.
[00:04:52.537 --> 00:05:01.563]  Then of course, we're going to do a deep dive on the border because the destruction of our country deliberately at the hands of the New World Order has never been more obvious.
[00:05:03.124 --> 00:05:06.807]  It's in the Associated Press, it's in the LA Times, it's in Fox News.
[00:05:06.827 --> 00:05:16.133]  The Biden administration is set to announce federal regulations, not law, that illegal aliens cannot leave the state they're shipped into.
[00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:30.109]   And that they're going to monitor them and let them stay But as terms of their release and getting taxpayer welfare, they must stay in Texas and Arizona.
[00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:33.289]  You're not allowed to go to Illinois or New York.
[00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.910]  Wow.
[00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.631]  And there's a lot more of that.
[00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:44.952]  Oh, the Democrats are openly banning RLK Jr.
[00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:45.812]  from being on the ballot.
[00:05:45.832 --> 00:05:46.192]  Stay with us.
[00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:49.112]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:49.892]  to 3 p.m.
[00:05:49.992 --> 00:05:54.254]  Central, the broadcast, The Enemy Dreads, is live.
[00:05:55.175 --> 00:06:00.417]  And it's because of our guests, our calls, our research, our will, that they fear it.
[00:06:01.057 --> 00:06:08.461]  And it's not a statement of bragging to say they fear it, that it insanely drives them into fits.
[00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:10.662]  We need to know what they fear.
[00:06:10.702 --> 00:06:12.443]  We need to know what's got their number.
[00:06:13.334 --> 00:06:14.335]  And it's this broadcast.
[00:06:14.835 --> 00:06:16.176]  It's this audience of activists.
[00:06:16.677 --> 00:06:24.503]  So on this Friday transmission, I salute you, I salute the stations, the affiliates, the sponsors, the crew, the callers, everybody that makes the transmission possible.
[00:06:26.184 --> 00:06:27.906]  Okay, wow.
[00:06:29.407 --> 00:06:33.250]  The World War III news is off the hook, off the chain.
[00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.054]  The open border news is more insane and redonkulous than ever.
[00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:44.711]  We have just got incredible world government ESG censorship news.
[00:06:46.052 --> 00:06:47.313]  That's all I can say.
[00:06:47.793 --> 00:06:51.935]  You know, as soon as I saw this story, I knew it was true.
[00:06:52.696 --> 00:06:53.396]  This one right here.
[00:06:54.397 --> 00:07:00.240]  Because it actually came out last year at the time, but didn't really make a lot of headway.
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.220]  The story didn't get legs.
[00:07:02.761 --> 00:07:21.626]   And that was these Boats, these drone boats loaded up with explosives that were using Starlink to sink a Russian battleship and then they were going to try to attack a Russian port with it and Elon Musk turned off the satellites so they couldn't do it.
[00:07:22.967 --> 00:07:26.188]  And the Ukrainian government has said Musk is committing evil.
[00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:29.029]  Well, I thought it's his company.
[00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:36.598]   If he doesn't want the Starlink system used as a weapons satellite, I mean, you think an AT&T satellite is doing this stuff?
[00:07:36.638 --> 00:07:36.818]  No.
[00:07:37.138 --> 00:07:41.141]  You have military satellites, you have research satellites, you have communication satellites.
[00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.662]  Military, research, communication.
[00:07:45.584 --> 00:07:50.767]  And when Musk first gave them a bunch of Starlink units, I said, this is bad.
[00:07:52.328 --> 00:07:57.872]  And this is, again, a private tech space company involved.
[00:07:58.172 --> 00:08:00.874]  And then we now know it wasn't just Musk.
[00:08:02.165 --> 00:08:12.472]  The Pentagon was concerned about this because the Ukrainians, that's why the Pentagon doesn't give the Ukrainians missiles that go more than 50 miles, because they keep shooting them into Russia, which is going to escalate this.
[00:08:13.013 --> 00:08:19.137]  And some people want to escalate in the Pentagon, others that don't want to blow the planet up, who aren't completely insane, don't want to.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.361]  And so there's two major camps there.
[00:08:22.381 --> 00:08:24.501]  Well, there's really more, but two large camps.
[00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:35.685]  The neocon, globalist, insane, World War III, nuclear war, survivable group, and then the other ones that are like, no, every scenario shows this only ends in bad, and it's not survivable, it'll destroy civilization.
[00:08:35.985 --> 00:08:36.525]  Let's stop now.
[00:08:38.365 --> 00:08:40.667]  So, the ADL saying, see?
[00:08:40.947 --> 00:08:42.268]  We need Musk taken off the air.
[00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:43.328]  We need Twitter taken over.
[00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:44.029]  Why?
[00:08:44.069 --> 00:08:47.351]  We've got extra guards in our facilities because he's sending people to attack us.
[00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:48.012]  Made up.
[00:08:48.412 --> 00:08:48.812]  Crazy.
[00:08:49.132 --> 00:08:50.113]  You're trying to bully him.
[00:08:50.393 --> 00:08:51.454]  You're trying to take over Twitter.
[00:08:51.734 --> 00:08:52.875]  You're trying to censor everybody.
[00:08:53.155 --> 00:08:53.775]  It's on record.
[00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:54.536]  You're already doing it.
[00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:55.236]  You got caught.
[00:08:55.597 --> 00:08:56.918]  You're doing it with all the other tech companies.
[00:08:57.898 --> 00:09:00.960]  But, separately, it's, well, Musk committed great evil.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:13.063]   He didn't let his civilian satellite system Be used, after he knew it was being used, to attack Russian targets in Russia.
[00:09:14.424 --> 00:09:15.885]  And that's the port there on the Black Sea.
[00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:31.173]  So, Russia told the Pentagon last year, it's all admitted here now, that if you attack any more of our ships and anchor in our port, we are going to take that as an attack by NATO.
[00:09:32.273 --> 00:09:42.500]  And the fact that you are asking Elon Musk to give thousands more of these units to do this, to put a unit in the boat, or whatever system it is, and then deploy it.
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:50.585]  If you do that, again, we are going to consider an attack by NATO, and our threat doctrine says we're going to start attacking NATO sites.
[00:09:51.505 --> 00:10:11.825]   Now we already have Zelensky caught last year firing two missiles into Poland, lying and saying that the Russians did it, but the Poles had the radar trajectory that the missiles were launched out of Eastern Ukraine, right on the border, and the Poles shot them both down, so they didn't fully detonate on the ground and destroy the entire missile.
[00:10:12.366 --> 00:10:19.749]  They shot them down in the air, cutting them in pieces, so they got the tail fins that were Ukrainian missiles.
[00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.971]  So, we avoided that.
[00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:27.132]  And there's been a bunch of other scenarios like that.
[00:10:27.152 --> 00:10:29.953]  Remember, Zelensky said, we have been hit.
[00:10:31.926 --> 00:10:38.170]  And Russia has hit Poland and we need full war and NATO right now.
[00:10:39.411 --> 00:10:52.680]  Then separately, you've got the bridge that comes out of Russia into Crimea that they keep trying to blow up with a truck bomb and then with these naval drones, which are really surface torpedoes.
[00:10:53.908 --> 00:10:56.489]  And so Musk said, I'm not in this war.
[00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:58.610]  I want to sell this to everybody.
[00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.971]  And we're not going to have military action with these anymore.
[00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:06.792]  And so the last I heard, he's just turned them all off there.
[00:11:07.613 --> 00:11:13.015]  So that just gives you an example of where all this is going.
[00:11:14.535 --> 00:11:23.854]   And then you can ask, well, why didn't the Pentagon Use their satellites to direct these surface drones, these water drones.
[00:11:25.015 --> 00:11:28.776]  Well, because that's direct war with Russia and Congress has not approved that.
[00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:32.738]  But really, Congress has not officially approved any of this stuff that's going on.
[00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:38.260]  So, we are rapidly sleepwalking into thermal nuclear war.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.881]  And all I can say is, I know the inside baseball on Musk.
[00:11:42.441 --> 00:11:43.482]  I don't completely trust him.
[00:11:43.542 --> 00:11:45.763]  I'm always going to sleep with one eye open.
[00:11:47.222 --> 00:11:48.524]  But I know people that know him well.
[00:11:49.485 --> 00:11:54.891]  He's got dozens of federal lawsuits, the Justice Department after him, the FTC, all of them.
[00:11:55.652 --> 00:11:56.713]  They've taken his son.
[00:11:56.753 --> 00:12:00.337]  They're about to chop his penis off in the system.
[00:12:01.299 --> 00:12:03.361]  And his brother almost died from the shot.
[00:12:03.381 --> 00:12:04.382]  He got sick from it.
[00:12:05.223 --> 00:12:07.005]  And all I see is good action out of Moscow.
[00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:09.368]  Obviously, he wants a monopoly on tech.
[00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:10.970]  He wants to be the cyborg guy.
[00:12:11.631 --> 00:12:14.013]  He wants to, you know, do all this.
[00:12:14.053 --> 00:12:19.820]  He wants to dominate it and have this driverless cars and all these things that are part of the agenda.
[00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:22.403]  And he's heavily in bed with China.
[00:12:22.443 --> 00:12:23.584]  But what big company isn't?
[00:12:24.165 --> 00:12:28.750]   I'm just saying Let's say he was going in the direction of the New World Order five years ago.
[00:12:29.391 --> 00:12:31.953]  He's done a 160 right now.
[00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:37.377]  He's not done a 180, but he's rapidly, he was a ship turning around to the ship's pointing north.
[00:12:37.918 --> 00:12:41.521]  He's already gone around 160 degrees due south.
[00:12:42.382 --> 00:12:50.909]  And he's moving quickly to be in direct alignment with my views and with just common sense analysis.
[00:12:52.682 --> 00:13:00.987]  So, I'm not going to bitch and complain when one of the kingpins of the system is coming around to us and is almost there.
[00:13:01.868 --> 00:13:06.070]  The analogy is he was 10 miles away from us and now he's right down the street waving at us.
[00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:07.191]  I mean, he's coming to us.
[00:13:08.372 --> 00:13:15.676]  And there may be some larger backup plan to blame this establisher for the problems and bring him in as a savior later.
[00:13:16.156 --> 00:13:16.517]  Whatever.
[00:13:16.597 --> 00:13:17.657]  We'll deal with that then.
[00:13:18.438 --> 00:13:26.035]   But I'm not going to sit here When Vivek Ramanswamy or Tulsi Gabbards or RFK Jr.
[00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:40.102]  comes out against open borders, comes out against gun control, comes out against human smuggling, comes out against carbon taxes like RFK and Tulsi have, and then say, well they, you know, Tulsi once went and spoke at the WEF, they all do.
[00:13:40.502 --> 00:13:42.723]  Or, well, you know, he's still for abortion.
[00:13:42.763 --> 00:13:43.643]  Yeah, I don't agree with that.
[00:13:44.504 --> 00:13:51.367]   But you cannot bitch and just say screw them when They're hitting on all cylinders.
[00:13:52.688 --> 00:13:54.410]  And folks, I've told you this for 20 years.
[00:13:55.151 --> 00:13:57.373]  I'm on air 29, but I figured this out about 20 years ago.
[00:13:58.053 --> 00:13:59.474]  I've said this probably 5,000 times.
[00:13:59.514 --> 00:14:00.015]  I'll say it again.
[00:14:00.055 --> 00:14:02.277]  I said it yesterday, so the day before, I said it last week.
[00:14:02.697 --> 00:14:03.678]  I'll probably say it next hour.
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:23.167]   There's not just evil in the universe, and one of the biggest reasons we fail is we expect That the enemy is overwhelmingly powerful and there's only evil in the universe, and so we never dare to do bold things because we think it's too insurmountable or too big.
[00:14:23.527 --> 00:14:25.729]  We're convincing almost everybody to join us.
[00:14:26.049 --> 00:14:32.635]  I had dinner with Joe Rogan recently, and he was just completely on fire, as hardcore as I am, and knew everything.
[00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:35.277]  And on his show, he's blasting them everywhere.
[00:14:36.558 --> 00:14:37.919]  He's like, you were right, you were right about everything.
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.562]  My God, he was just finishing my sentences for me.
[00:14:41.516 --> 00:14:50.319]  I mean like, well the real issue, you have to understand what they've done with COVID, is it was about corrupting the system so they could blackmail him.
[00:14:50.579 --> 00:14:52.760]  And then he just finished my sentences and went on with it.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.481]  So, again, have we won?
[00:14:56.681 --> 00:14:56.941]  No.
[00:14:57.061 --> 00:14:58.122]  Are we turning the tide?
[00:14:58.262 --> 00:14:58.582]  Yes.
[00:14:59.582 --> 00:15:02.763]  Praise God, and just be aware of that fact.
[00:15:03.584 --> 00:15:05.344]  And pass the ammunition and the info war.
[00:15:06.385 --> 00:15:14.343]   So when we come back, I want to hit the border because it's really had a bunch of big developments and so much more.
[00:15:14.403 --> 00:15:26.408]  But when people are trying to come around us and join us and defect to our side, let's not give them the keys to the kingdom, let's not put them in charge, but let's sure as hell let them join us and prove themselves.
[00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:28.469]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:28.489 --> 00:15:28.869]  Stay with us.
[00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.911]  I want to lay something out here that's critical.
[00:15:34.363 --> 00:15:45.427]  And that it's that globalism is corporate government alliance administratively attacking any company, any business, any individual, any family that they don't own and control.
[00:15:46.068 --> 00:15:47.388]  And consolidating that.
[00:15:47.428 --> 00:15:48.589]  That's what the lockdowns were.
[00:15:49.589 --> 00:15:51.430]  The average billionaire more than doubled their wealth.
[00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.331]  The average family or individual went into huge debt.
[00:15:54.911 --> 00:15:56.952]  It shut down around a third of our small businesses.
[00:15:57.032 --> 00:15:58.513]  It just devastated the third world.
[00:15:59.537 --> 00:16:06.766]  And it's the same thing with the dumbing down of the children, and the open borders, and the defunding police, and the exploding crime.
[00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.488]  It's demoralizing us.
[00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:10.751]  It's an attempt to break our will.
[00:16:11.672 --> 00:16:17.379]  So, 3, 4, 5 million conservatively, illegal aliens come across each year.
[00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.891]  And when they get here, it's under U.N.
[00:16:22.451 --> 00:16:22.991]  control.
[00:16:23.011 --> 00:16:23.912]  They've got U.N.
[00:16:24.392 --> 00:16:25.152]  debit cards.
[00:16:25.192 --> 00:16:26.693]  They're signed up to the Democratic Party.
[00:16:27.133 --> 00:16:29.554]  The Democrat Party and these lawyers take part of their paychecks.
[00:16:29.954 --> 00:16:37.237]  They also sign them up for welfare, welfare fraud, tax returns, you name it, of money that they aren't owed.
[00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:39.117]  And they steal it.
[00:16:40.358 --> 00:16:43.019]  And the people they're bringing in are totally being exploited.
[00:16:44.445 --> 00:16:45.646]  Just like they farm the homeless.
[00:16:45.666 --> 00:16:49.528]  They have aid workers that will get hundreds of thousands of dollars a year per homeless person.
[00:16:49.548 --> 00:16:51.989]  And the homeless person might get $30,000 of it.
[00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:58.272]  So they use the social safety net to create a spider's web to capture people in it.
[00:16:59.653 --> 00:17:02.955]  So Texas has tried to put up floating barriers in the Rio Grande.
[00:17:02.995 --> 00:17:04.136]  The feds are suing.
[00:17:04.516 --> 00:17:06.417]  States are threatening criminal charges.
[00:17:07.437 --> 00:17:09.639]  The governor has shipped so many illegals to California.
[00:17:09.939 --> 00:17:12.340]  They're talking about criminal charges against Governor Abbott.
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.561]  I'll show you that article.
[00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:16.252]  So they tell the illegals come here.
[00:17:16.332 --> 00:17:17.792]  They say it's a sanctuary city.
[00:17:18.672 --> 00:17:26.975]  We, then, in our states that are overwhelmed and paying for all of this, ship a few, a small percent, to New York and Illinois and other places.
[00:17:27.735 --> 00:17:29.316]  Massachusetts, Martha's Vineyard.
[00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:31.977]  And they ship them out immediately.
[00:17:31.997 --> 00:17:34.658]  It's the same thing in the UK.
[00:17:34.738 --> 00:17:36.138]  Same thing in Europe.
[00:17:36.498 --> 00:17:43.741]  The same NGOs that are UN-run run the border operation, entering command, on record, of ICE.
[00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:53.375]  And it's about human smuggling, sex trafficking, drugs, you know, all God's children is what Nancy Pelosi called MS-13 a few years ago.
[00:17:54.435 --> 00:18:03.001]  So, Biden administration considers forcing illegals to stay in Texas as blue states complain about the illegal aliens and the cost.
[00:18:03.561 --> 00:18:04.302]  Here's Fox News.
[00:18:04.342 --> 00:18:07.444]  Biden administration considering plan to force migrants to remain in Texas.
[00:18:07.484 --> 00:18:09.085]  Report from the LA Times.
[00:18:11.141 --> 00:18:17.406]  Texas is in the midst of a feud with the administration over the state's migrant busing program and floating barriers.
[00:18:17.426 --> 00:18:30.396]  And it goes on to say, Biden administration has told ICE that they are preparing to bring in regulations where the illegals will be made to wear ankle monitors and must stay in Texas.
[00:18:32.238 --> 00:18:35.481]  That will, quote, curb the flow of illegal immigrants on the southern border.
[00:18:36.465 --> 00:18:38.327]  The Los Angeles Times citing three U.S.
[00:18:38.367 --> 00:18:40.268]  officials not authorized to discuss the matter.
[00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:49.276]  The plan would force migrants to remain in Texas or possibly other border states by tracking their location with GPS monitoring devices such as ankle bracelets, the officials told the Times.
[00:18:49.477 --> 00:18:50.317]  Really, it's their cell phone.
[00:18:51.759 --> 00:18:52.319]  And it goes on.
[00:18:52.399 --> 00:18:56.583]  So... Come here.
[00:18:56.663 --> 00:18:58.585]  If I win the election, immediately surge the border.
[00:18:58.605 --> 00:18:59.225]  Remember those clips?
[00:19:00.411 --> 00:19:01.731]  He said it twice in debates.
[00:19:01.812 --> 00:19:03.112]  I've played it probably 500 times.
[00:19:03.132 --> 00:19:04.352]  I'm not going to play it again.
[00:19:04.372 --> 00:19:05.933]  I can't stand to look at Biden.
[00:19:06.333 --> 00:19:06.933]  But he said that.
[00:19:08.254 --> 00:19:09.974]  And they come here.
[00:19:10.334 --> 00:19:11.434]  He violates federal law.
[00:19:11.454 --> 00:19:15.636]  He won't let federal judges or magistrates hold people that are violating the law, including pedophiles.
[00:19:15.976 --> 00:19:16.836]  That's come out in the news.
[00:19:18.717 --> 00:19:22.178]  And then they turn around and say, by the way, they're going to stay in Texas.
[00:19:23.294 --> 00:19:25.156]  And then these people will be signed up to vote.
[00:19:25.676 --> 00:19:26.997]  People say, oh, the illegals don't vote.
[00:19:27.057 --> 00:19:33.403]  Democrats all over the country and their states have legalized illegals voting and legalized illegals being police officers.
[00:19:35.345 --> 00:19:37.046]  It's just next level.
[00:19:37.807 --> 00:19:38.407]  But it gets worse.
[00:19:39.128 --> 00:19:44.413]  Sanctuary City of Los Angeles considers criminal charges against Texas for sending illegal immigrants.
[00:19:46.806 --> 00:19:49.288]  Texas has sent a total of 11 buses of migrants to Los Angeles.
[00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:50.029]  Oh boy!
[00:19:50.049 --> 00:19:53.551]  It's like 11 buses coming across Texas every five minutes.
[00:19:54.212 --> 00:19:58.675]  Beginning with the June 14th arrival containing a total of 435 quote migrants.
[00:19:59.576 --> 00:20:01.117]  Well they're migrating, they're allowed to come to your state.
[00:20:02.078 --> 00:20:03.059]  Big giant article.
[00:20:03.079 --> 00:20:05.200]  They're sending criminal charges against the governor and others.
[00:20:05.701 --> 00:20:06.201]  Here's another one.
[00:20:06.742 --> 00:20:13.087]  Judge orders Texas to remove floating border barriers, granting Biden administration's request.
[00:20:14.741 --> 00:20:25.384]  So Texas, on its own side of the river, can't even stick up a floating barrier, and the feds are blocking that.
[00:20:25.945 --> 00:20:27.765]  But then you gotta stay here, we gotta pay for it.
[00:20:30.906 --> 00:20:35.948]  Canada's complaining about the tens of thousands coming in to their borders from the U.S.
[00:20:36.148 --> 00:20:36.588]  every week.
[00:20:38.228 --> 00:20:40.549]  They decry surging illegal migrants at the northern border.
[00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:52.951]   And what did The mayor of New York, the race-baiting Al Sharpton 2.0, what's he even saying?
[00:20:53.531 --> 00:20:54.671]  It's destroying us.
[00:20:54.711 --> 00:20:56.012]  The city's falling apart.
[00:20:57.533 --> 00:21:00.374]  And they're giving the illegals $10,000 a month in New York.
[00:21:00.614 --> 00:21:01.854]  Wow, that's pretty good money.
[00:21:03.975 --> 00:21:07.577]  A social security recipient maxing out their payment is what, a little over $2,000?
[00:21:07.957 --> 00:21:11.358]  So you paid into this your whole life, you get $2,000.
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.823]  But the state gives you 10,000, the feds give the illegals a couple thousand, because they want them here.
[00:21:19.243 --> 00:21:25.647]  Oh, and the illegals might not want to take a poison shot, so they're all exempt in the public schools, not just in New York, but across the country.
[00:21:26.187 --> 00:21:27.028]  Oh, you're an illegal alien.
[00:21:27.068 --> 00:21:28.569]  You don't need ID to fly.
[00:21:28.849 --> 00:21:29.669]  You're an illegal alien.
[00:21:29.749 --> 00:21:32.751]  You don't need a vaccine.
[00:21:32.971 --> 00:21:33.732]  By the way, it's a lie.
[00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:38.414]  They can't make any of us take it, but they fired 70,000 health care workers in New York alone that wouldn't take the shot.
[00:21:38.895 --> 00:21:40.575]  They kicked out tens of thousands of military.
[00:21:40.636 --> 00:21:41.196]  See how it works?
[00:21:42.902 --> 00:21:45.003]  Citizens are at the lowest rung.
[00:21:45.043 --> 00:21:46.203]  We're like the slave.
[00:21:46.443 --> 00:21:48.284]  It's like a caste system like they had in India.
[00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:57.708]  Where you've got the Brahmin up at the top, and you've got the ministerial people, and you've got the servant class at the bottom that can never get out of their caste.
[00:22:01.349 --> 00:22:02.710]  And that's who we are as citizens.
[00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.110]  We're the schmucks that pay the bills.
[00:22:05.311 --> 00:22:08.712]  We're the schmucks that, you know, oh, you got waved at by police at the Capitol?
[00:22:09.622 --> 00:22:10.402]  You didn't hurt anybody?
[00:22:10.962 --> 00:22:15.144]  You're getting five years in prison, we're gonna SWAT team your ass and put you in solitary confinement.
[00:22:15.284 --> 00:22:16.785]  Because we're the FBI!
[00:22:18.685 --> 00:22:19.686]  Because you're the enemy.
[00:22:20.286 --> 00:22:23.227]  You're the American that thinks they have a Bill of Rights, a Constitution.
[00:22:24.807 --> 00:22:31.390]  We're gonna go to break in a few minutes, and come back with Eric Adams saying, quote, New York will collapse.
[00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:33.250]  New York is being destroyed.
[00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:34.591]  Really, buddy boy?
[00:22:35.711 --> 00:22:37.652]  What do you think's happening to the rest of the country?
[00:22:38.851 --> 00:22:40.873]  Gavin Newsom, buddy boy, what do you think?
[00:22:41.753 --> 00:22:58.906]  All of these governors and mayors see the crime and the people everywhere and the breakdown of society, and then they turn around and say, not here, and Eric Adams wants to ship them to Long Island.
[00:23:00.205 --> 00:23:04.109]  Yeah, let's take 100,000, that's what's in New York conservatively, the number of places to stay.
[00:23:04.469 --> 00:23:05.850]  The hotels are all full, you name it.
[00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:07.191]  They put them in luxury hotels.
[00:23:07.492 --> 00:23:12.096]  Here, let's ship 100,000 people and just throw them out on the street in Rhode Island.
[00:23:13.177 --> 00:23:16.820]  Let's ship them up to Kingston, or Rochester, or Buffalo.
[00:23:19.342 --> 00:23:20.844]  That's the same thing over and over again, isn't it?
[00:23:22.483 --> 00:23:24.543]  But don't come to Martha's Vineyard one bus load.
[00:23:25.384 --> 00:23:26.804]  No, you're gone in one day.
[00:23:27.124 --> 00:23:28.344]  Get your ass out of here.
[00:23:28.804 --> 00:23:30.444]  You don't come to where Obama lives.
[00:23:31.104 --> 00:23:31.825]  No sir!
[00:23:34.125 --> 00:23:34.785]  No sir!
[00:23:36.285 --> 00:23:38.106]  Not in my backyard, in your backyard.
[00:23:38.446 --> 00:23:39.666]  And does it help the third world people?
[00:23:39.726 --> 00:23:39.886]  No.
[00:23:39.986 --> 00:23:41.266]  It lowers us to their level.
[00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:43.547]  Which is what Ross Perot said.
[00:23:43.567 --> 00:23:45.607]  He said, you pass this NAFTA to this cat.
[00:23:45.627 --> 00:23:47.107]  It'll be a giant second sound.
[00:23:47.127 --> 00:23:48.588]  You're not going to help Mexico.
[00:23:48.888 --> 00:23:50.988]  You're going to lower their level when this is all done as well and lower us.
[00:23:52.694 --> 00:23:54.174]  Higher standards will raise them up.
[00:23:55.055 --> 00:23:56.335]  Lower standards will lower us all.

[00:24:51.964 --> 00:24:54.946]  You talk about cleansing out all the garbage we've been bombarded with.

[00:25:24.181 --> 00:25:25.342]  Alright, so it is...
[00:25:27.563 --> 00:25:28.384]  Beyond obvious.
[00:25:28.504 --> 00:25:39.655]  It's the UN plan to collapse the third world and organize the groups and have the State Department give them debit cards to come into the United States and just flood everywhere.
[00:25:39.716 --> 00:25:40.636]  Just everywhere.
[00:25:41.537 --> 00:25:49.826]  And in the studies with the North African and Middle Eastern folks that come in, after five years, 90% don't have a job.
[00:25:52.346 --> 00:25:53.087]  Because there aren't the jobs.
[00:25:53.727 --> 00:25:56.229]  I mean, Spain has like 40% unemployment.
[00:25:56.829 --> 00:25:58.250]  And they've just shipped millions into there.
[00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:00.332]  Okay, Italy, huge unemployment, 30%.
[00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:02.733]  Here, let's put in 5 million there.
[00:26:04.234 --> 00:26:04.975]  England, you name it.
[00:26:05.715 --> 00:26:09.318]  When you read these articles that are in mainstream news, it doesn't sound believable.
[00:26:09.758 --> 00:26:13.701]  Well, a couple thousand arrived in the last few days on Zodiac boats from France.
[00:26:14.621 --> 00:26:16.443]  And the French are like, here, we'll offload them on you.
[00:26:18.294 --> 00:26:21.135]  And then they put them in luxury hotels and kick everybody out.
[00:26:21.755 --> 00:26:24.855]  And in some cases they've been there two, three years just sitting in a luxury hotel.
[00:26:26.616 --> 00:26:28.776]  But notice France ships them to the UK.
[00:26:32.737 --> 00:26:36.298]  In Germany they'll ship them out of an elite area into a small village of poor people.
[00:26:36.318 --> 00:26:38.178]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:26:38.438 --> 00:26:39.218]  They tell them, come!
[00:26:39.358 --> 00:26:39.879]  Come here!
[00:26:39.979 --> 00:26:40.279]  Come!
[00:26:40.379 --> 00:26:40.679]  Come!
[00:26:41.259 --> 00:26:52.954]   And then, okay, well Democrats are mad that you're coming to Illinois and New York and Wisconsin And Minnesota, and California, and everywhere else.
[00:26:53.454 --> 00:26:56.657]  So, we'll just ship them to Texas.
[00:26:57.398 --> 00:27:07.446]  And then we'll tell them, with a GPS phone they gotta have, and a GPS monitor on their ankle, your court date set in 2032 is the average court date.
[00:27:08.007 --> 00:27:08.307]  Turn around.
[00:27:08.327 --> 00:27:08.307]  2032.
[00:27:09.108 --> 00:27:10.629]  Nine years from now.
[00:27:11.874 --> 00:27:12.915]  You can do whatever you want.
[00:27:13.335 --> 00:27:16.038]  We'll sign you up with lawyers that get you on welfare and get you a job.
[00:27:16.078 --> 00:27:17.159]  We'll skim the money.
[00:27:19.181 --> 00:27:20.382]  But you can't leave Texas.
[00:27:24.025 --> 00:27:27.588]  And then you tell them, hey, you want to stay here?
[00:27:27.628 --> 00:27:33.553]  We're going to deport you if you don't go vote, if you don't go sign up to vote.
[00:27:34.754 --> 00:27:36.196]  And that's how you turn Texas blue.
[00:27:37.532 --> 00:27:40.973]  And the Democrats are like, we'll arrest anybody who says illegals are voting.
[00:27:41.433 --> 00:27:44.174]  Some of the charges in Georgia on Trump is he claims illegals voted.
[00:27:44.474 --> 00:27:47.435]  It's on record 40-something thousand illegals voted in Georgia they know of.
[00:27:47.955 --> 00:27:48.715]  They use their names.
[00:27:50.476 --> 00:27:50.916]  They did it.
[00:27:50.936 --> 00:27:55.317]  50,000 they found in Michigan of dead people.
[00:27:57.357 --> 00:28:00.558]  And again, Owen Schroyer may not be here next week.
[00:28:02.579 --> 00:28:05.039]  And I've been asked by his lawyer not to antagonize the system.
[00:28:05.059 --> 00:28:06.600]  Not antagonize the system, okay.
[00:28:07.912 --> 00:28:13.976]  But here's a big news item, it's all over the place, that they put in the sentencing recommendation from the feds.
[00:28:13.996 --> 00:28:15.997]  In fact, it was in two days ago, stacked.
[00:28:16.017 --> 00:28:17.498]  Will you guys re-pull that for me or re-print it?
[00:28:18.358 --> 00:28:23.682]  This doesn't even sound real, but the Gateway Pundit reported on it, and I was going to shut up about it, but I just...
[00:28:25.014 --> 00:28:27.996]  Owen said, do whatever you think's best, and I just, it's his life.
[00:28:28.897 --> 00:28:36.103]  And they say on August 27th, he said the election was stolen again, and that Joe Biden's a pedophile.
[00:28:36.623 --> 00:28:42.788]  Therefore, we recommend, because he's not repentant for lying, that he serve prison time.
[00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:49.534]  I mean, it actually says it four or five times.
[00:28:50.728 --> 00:28:52.729]  But they go, but we're not violating his First Amendment.
[00:28:52.749 --> 00:28:54.089]  They give some Supreme Court ruling.
[00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:55.090]  Doesn't even say that.
[00:28:55.930 --> 00:29:01.012]  But we want jail time for being at the Capitol trying to keep people from going in.
[00:29:01.032 --> 00:29:04.394]  And people say, well, why didn't they charge me?
[00:29:04.434 --> 00:29:05.034]  They're trying.
[00:29:05.454 --> 00:29:06.094]  They're going around.
[00:29:08.735 --> 00:29:11.036]  We knew there was nothing on Owen's phone because we didn't play anything.
[00:29:11.537 --> 00:29:14.118]  But they told Owen, you know, we'll go easy on you.
[00:29:14.158 --> 00:29:15.378]  Won't go for any criminal time.
[00:29:15.398 --> 00:29:16.459]  Just give us your phone.
[00:29:17.699 --> 00:29:18.419]  Gave the phone.
[00:29:18.439 --> 00:29:19.640]  They said, you don't have a written agreement.
[00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.969]  There's nothing on the phone.
[00:29:21.989 --> 00:29:23.990]  Remember the headline?
[00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:26.251]  Oh, Owen's turning state's evidence.
[00:29:26.571 --> 00:29:27.951]  He's going to expose Alex Jones.
[00:29:27.971 --> 00:29:28.891]  Why do you agree to give him that?
[00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:30.632]  Owen asked, do you mind if I do this?
[00:29:30.692 --> 00:29:31.932]  And I said, it's up to you and your lawyer.
[00:29:31.952 --> 00:29:32.753]  I mean, there's nothing there.
[00:29:32.773 --> 00:29:34.033]  We didn't plan anything.
[00:29:34.053 --> 00:29:36.894]  Of course, the text messages are like, we got to stop this.
[00:29:39.093 --> 00:29:40.314]  We don't go attack capitals.
[00:29:40.374 --> 00:29:43.375]  I've been to all these other protests where we go into the Georgia Capitol, the Texas Capitol.
[00:29:43.635 --> 00:29:44.516]  We ever attack anybody?
[00:29:44.576 --> 00:29:45.536]  No, that's not what I do.
[00:29:45.597 --> 00:29:46.657]  I don't go attack the police.
[00:29:46.937 --> 00:29:47.978]  Never have, never will.
[00:29:48.318 --> 00:29:49.018]  Not my MO.
[00:29:49.078 --> 00:29:49.999]  I'm a Christian conservative.
[00:29:50.339 --> 00:29:51.480]  Plus, it's a dumb thing to do.
[00:29:53.301 --> 00:29:55.202]  We wanted a 10-day investigation of the Senate.
[00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:56.763]  It's in the Constitution and the law.
[00:29:59.344 --> 00:30:03.306]  So, it's just mind-blowing.
[00:30:04.227 --> 00:30:14.747]   You know, I am going to cover it, so go ahead and print me the The Senate's recommendation by the prosecutors, and I'll read it, it's like 30 pages long, but I'll scan over it.
[00:30:15.348 --> 00:30:19.010]  Sometime today, I'm just going to show it to you, because I don't like to just say something and I'll show you.
[00:30:19.471 --> 00:30:28.677]  It says, he is unrepentant, he is unrepentant, and he's not sorry for what he did, and he attacked the Capitol.
[00:30:29.418 --> 00:30:29.858]  Total lie.
[00:30:31.539 --> 00:30:33.140]  And he brought them there to attack it.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:33.841]  Total lie.
[00:30:35.425 --> 00:30:41.287]  And Jones's people intimidated the Capitol Police and didn't have permission to be there.
[00:30:41.727 --> 00:30:43.427]  We get there and say, you got emergency speakers?
[00:30:43.447 --> 00:30:44.848]  You got to get on them and tell everybody to get out.
[00:30:45.428 --> 00:30:48.089]  I'm going to get over there and tell them, you know, don't go in the building.
[00:30:48.369 --> 00:30:49.309]  They said, sure, go ahead.
[00:30:49.989 --> 00:30:51.150]  We have it all on footage.
[00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:52.070]  All the feds have.
[00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:56.031]  Is the footage that live streamed by other people.
[00:30:56.251 --> 00:30:58.311]  We have, and it's with a bunch of law firms.
[00:30:58.352 --> 00:30:58.732]  We've got it.
[00:30:58.752 --> 00:30:59.552]  You're not going to stop us.
[00:31:00.332 --> 00:31:04.633]  We have all of the body cams of our 12 security people.
[00:31:05.053 --> 00:31:07.394]  We have the police on video, Capitol Police.
[00:31:07.834 --> 00:31:10.295]  I said, hey, they said, hey, you can't use the loudspeakers.
[00:31:10.315 --> 00:31:11.095]  We're not going to use them.
[00:31:12.555 --> 00:31:15.756]  But you can go up to the top and try to use your free speech to stop this.
[00:31:16.656 --> 00:31:17.377]  And I said, OK.
[00:31:17.617 --> 00:31:19.637]  And they gave me time to go up and get in there.
[00:31:20.217 --> 00:31:21.338]  Tell people, get out of here.
[00:31:21.418 --> 00:31:21.998]  Don't go in.
[00:31:23.059 --> 00:31:25.559]  and some listened, some left with me.
[00:31:25.559 --> 00:31:28.059]   So I did it on the front of the Capitol, on the side of the Capitol,
[00:31:28.059 --> 00:31:31.059]   and as soon as I got down off the steps, they flash-banged 'em,
[00:31:31.059 --> 00:31:33.099]  but they still couldn't stop 'em and they broke in.
[00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:38.539]   I'm not saying I deserve a medal or anything, but I mean, I'm literally there stopping them
[00:31:38.539 --> 00:31:42.799]   to go in on one side while the doors were open, they were waving 'em in through velvet ropes,
[00:31:42.799 --> 00:31:49.438]   and I'm on the back side, or the side, saying, "Okay, if you won't get on the speaker system
[00:31:49.438 --> 00:31:50.278]  "or I can't get on it,"
[00:31:50.278 --> 00:31:52.000]  'cause by the nighttime they had it on.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.398]  You can hear it a mile away.
[00:31:53.323 --> 00:31:54.605]  This is an emergency area.
[00:31:54.645 --> 00:31:55.706]  Do not approach the Capitol.
[00:31:55.726 --> 00:31:56.386]  You'll be arrested.
[00:31:56.887 --> 00:31:57.527]  Leave now.
[00:31:57.587 --> 00:31:58.128]  Leave now.
[00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:12.020]  And I sat there from a rooftop and watched them flashbang and attack a very small group of people that were left as it got dark that were sucked into all that I couldn't stop.
[00:32:13.086 --> 00:32:15.388]  But I went to exercise my First Amendment.
[00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:30.084]  And now, Owen Schroer, it really sunk in this morning, he gets on an airplane, Sunday, or it's Monday morning, he flies to D.C., and they're trying to put him in jail.
[00:32:30.804 --> 00:32:38.584]   And the whole charging document Or the recommendation of sentencing is the same charging document that is a fabrication.
[00:32:38.624 --> 00:32:41.205]  I mean, the thing is a lie, pillar to post.
[00:32:41.806 --> 00:32:43.006]  Up one side and down the other.
[00:32:43.746 --> 00:32:45.187]  But that's just the feds, you see.
[00:32:46.027 --> 00:32:47.448]  They do whatever they want.
[00:32:47.468 --> 00:32:51.070]  Dis-gusting.
[00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.531]  So, we may not have Owen next week, folks.
[00:32:55.111 --> 00:32:55.511]  That's right.
[00:32:55.531 --> 00:32:58.753]  Alright, we'll come back and get into the collapse of the border and more.
[00:33:00.523 --> 00:33:01.824]  This is just such a sad time.
[00:33:02.945 --> 00:33:05.646]  It's Friday, September 8, 2023.
[00:33:07.148 --> 00:33:10.410]  And we're not talking about conspiracy theories here today.
[00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.812]  We're not talking about theoretical things.
[00:33:13.832 --> 00:33:21.597]  We're not talking about things that are fiction or postulating possible futures.
[00:33:21.637 --> 00:33:29.543]  We're talking about what is known to be deployed that is being rolled out right now against humanity.
[00:33:30.868 --> 00:33:44.854]  And one of my greatest frustrations, I've been on there 29 years, is I'd read Pentagon documents that were public 25, 26 years ago about spider goats that are part spider that create body armor through their milk for the Pentagon, for a giant project.
[00:33:45.514 --> 00:33:46.615]  And China has it as well.
[00:33:47.635 --> 00:33:52.777]  And callers would call in and say, there's no way we have goats spliced with spiders, that's just made up.
[00:33:54.618 --> 00:34:02.549]   It's this week they came out and said, yeah, we've created humanoids in the laboratory that don't have any There's no sperm or eggs involved or any parents.
[00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:05.350]  But we're not going to upset you.
[00:34:05.471 --> 00:34:06.011]  It's discreet.
[00:34:06.031 --> 00:34:09.213]  We're not going to show them to you.
[00:34:09.233 --> 00:34:12.514]  So, see, we don't have little great men from Mars landing, little green men.
[00:34:12.534 --> 00:34:18.298]  We don't have foreign aliens proven here, but we have alien life forms being created on Earth.
[00:34:18.398 --> 00:34:19.298]  So, here we are.
[00:34:21.339 --> 00:34:29.339]   on the special Friday transmission, the Alex Jones Show 2.0, exclusively at Stephen Crowder and the Mug Club.
[00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:41.819]   This is a live syndicated radio/TV broadcast, but yes, I shot a two and a half hour
[00:34:41.819 --> 00:34:49.339]   turn to force breakdown of the DARPA mind control programs, the spike proteins,
[00:34:49.339 --> 00:34:57.418]   chips in our brains, human-animal hybrids, and the Pentagon and their spokespersons admitting it all.
[00:34:57.657 --> 00:35:04.719]  I meant to tape an hour, but once I get going, it's two and a half hours commercial free at jonescrowder.com.

[00:35:19.423 --> 00:35:20.144]  You want to support us?
[00:35:21.144 --> 00:35:24.745]  Go get that membership and that helps fund everything we're doing here.
[00:35:26.405 --> 00:35:30.130]  And we'll find us going to the RNC-DNC and a lot of other big events that are coming in.
[00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:40.762]  There's going to be some big stuff happening in October with the show and some big announcements and big things that I think will probably get about 200 million views.
[00:35:41.663 --> 00:35:42.844]  That's a conservative number.
[00:35:43.545 --> 00:35:45.127]  I mean, big stuff.
[00:35:46.052 --> 00:35:47.873]  I think a lot of you put two and two together, but what?
[00:35:48.253 --> 00:35:49.114]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:35:49.554 --> 00:35:51.555]  I'm just not going to say anything else.
[00:35:52.315 --> 00:35:54.376]  It's been a painful process being crucified.
[00:35:54.817 --> 00:36:06.243]  It's not been fun in many ways, but it's been very rewarding and enriching to be through the gauntlet and have the public recognize that we really are the tip of the spear and we really are having a big effect together.
[00:36:07.123 --> 00:36:10.445]  And so for every evil thing they do to us, God turns it towards good.
[00:36:11.166 --> 00:36:12.486]  It's not fun to be lied about.
[00:36:12.906 --> 00:36:15.428]  I read the stories that come out constantly and none of it's true.
[00:36:17.125 --> 00:36:22.067]  Just absolute garbage, but I just realized that's what they do, folks.
[00:36:22.588 --> 00:36:29.531]  That's who they are, and that's why they're so discredited, and that's why they're trying to set up an official dictatorship in this country.
[00:36:30.491 --> 00:36:32.292]  Okay, so there's a lot of these clips.
[00:36:32.352 --> 00:36:40.923]   Everybody's seen them, but there was a new one yesterday with Eric Adams, the New York mayor that replaced Hard to believe he's better than the last guy.
[00:36:40.963 --> 00:36:41.784]  That's not saying much.
[00:36:41.804 --> 00:36:48.369]  It's like the last mayor was a 5,000 pound turd and Eric Adams is a 2,000 pound turd.
[00:36:48.889 --> 00:36:50.290]  Race baiting constantly, you name it.
[00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.072]  But New Yorkers are just under total pressure.
[00:36:53.112 --> 00:36:54.013]  They can't pay their bills.
[00:36:54.053 --> 00:36:54.994]  Things are falling apart.
[00:36:55.434 --> 00:36:58.937]  And there's 100,000 illegals at least that don't even have jobs just laying around everywhere.
[00:36:59.357 --> 00:37:01.319]  Most of them are being put up in nice hotels.
[00:37:01.979 --> 00:37:03.901]  He's trying to ship them again to different parts of New York.
[00:37:05.157 --> 00:37:07.277]  And he goes to Biden and says, we need money for this.
[00:37:07.317 --> 00:37:09.038]  And Biden's like, hey, these are your new voters.
[00:37:09.138 --> 00:37:09.558]  Shut up.
[00:37:12.118 --> 00:37:25.161]  And so Biden now wants to keep them in Texas and then under federal orders, he legally brings them in, tells them, come here, gives them all this money and says, now you got to stay in Texas.
[00:37:27.502 --> 00:37:28.922]  Texas is what, 30 million people?
[00:37:28.962 --> 00:37:29.902]  Well, what's the population of Texas?
[00:37:29.962 --> 00:37:31.883]  Guys, look at it for me.
[00:37:31.963 --> 00:37:37.747]   I mean, being in Texas, I'd say, Ten million are illegal aliens in Texas alone?
[00:37:37.767 --> 00:37:39.569]  I mean, there's probably four million in Houston.
[00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:46.314]  Now, most of them have gone and gotten a job and they want to have kids and have a life in a swimming pool and they're actually great people.
[00:37:47.475 --> 00:37:51.699]  But those are the folks that have been here for decades and have assimilated.
[00:37:52.519 --> 00:37:59.305]  The new ones are from all over the world and a lot of them are mentally ill or they're criminals or they have no skills.
[00:38:00.526 --> 00:38:02.768]  They're like dumping their mental institutions out on us.
[00:38:04.636 --> 00:38:05.256]  Yep, there it is.
[00:38:05.296 --> 00:38:06.417]  I guessed it right from memory.
[00:38:07.217 --> 00:38:07.537]  30 million.
[00:38:08.418 --> 00:38:09.718]  At least 10 million are legal.
[00:38:10.278 --> 00:38:14.700]  Well, I mean, if they're bringing in 5 to 10 million, the estimates vary.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.201]  Most are about 6 million a year.
[00:38:16.221 --> 00:38:18.802]  And they want to keep them all in Texas.
[00:38:19.282 --> 00:38:24.124]  Well, Texas will be 36 million then in a year, and there's their voting bloc.
[00:38:24.144 --> 00:38:26.825]  Because they're only, Democrats are losing by about 2 points here.
[00:38:28.134 --> 00:38:28.534]  Two points.
[00:38:29.215 --> 00:38:30.516]  They've already got state control.
[00:38:30.536 --> 00:38:32.757]  They've already gotten all the cities.
[00:38:33.398 --> 00:38:37.761]  San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, Austin, El Paso.
[00:38:39.482 --> 00:38:40.483]  They got control, folks.
[00:38:41.183 --> 00:38:43.005]  And these illegals do what they're told.
[00:38:44.506 --> 00:38:45.847]  Because they're under the control.
[00:38:45.887 --> 00:38:49.970]  With a cell phone the government gave them, and with an ankle bracelet.
[00:38:51.112 --> 00:38:57.674]  And then here comes the Democrat operatives and they say, okay, here's the name of the dead person, the person that moved out of state.
[00:38:57.914 --> 00:39:03.936]  They got a Facebook database that Zuckerberg spent 400 and something million on, 450 million, something like that, 445 million.
[00:39:04.076 --> 00:39:04.416]  Look it up.
[00:39:06.522 --> 00:39:09.344]  On the last election, 2020, the last presidential one.
[00:39:09.884 --> 00:39:11.325]  Spent $100 million on the midterm.
[00:39:11.886 --> 00:39:12.526]  That's just him.
[00:39:13.227 --> 00:39:15.528]  Databasing all the people that moved out of state or died.
[00:39:16.289 --> 00:39:22.333]  They create a roll, they give it to them, they fill out the name, the illegal goes in and votes, or they put it in the drop box.
[00:39:25.055 --> 00:39:25.755]  And that's their plan.
[00:39:27.036 --> 00:39:34.021]  So, California says they're going to arrest the Texas governor for shipping a few buses to California.
[00:39:35.879 --> 00:39:36.659]  These people are sick.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.400]  Here's the New York Mayor.
[00:39:42.741 --> 00:39:48.502]  Started with a madman down in Texas, decided he wanted to bus people up to New York City.
[00:39:49.983 --> 00:39:52.843]  Hundred and ten- Pause, pause.
[00:39:52.863 --> 00:39:53.583]  Back up and start again.
[00:39:54.384 --> 00:39:59.525]  It started with a madman in Texas that decided he'd bus some people here.
[00:40:00.065 --> 00:40:03.266]  Most of the illegals are already going there because it has the biggest welfare check, dummy.
[00:40:05.034 --> 00:40:09.998]  New York State's giving them 10 grand, or $10,100 a month.
[00:40:10.038 --> 00:40:14.201]  Hell, I'm not saying I'm an illegal alien, just go up there.
[00:40:16.583 --> 00:40:18.585]  They give them driver's license, they let them vote.
[00:40:19.165 --> 00:40:22.188]  Hell, in Illinois they can be cops, and in Mexico they can be cops.
[00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.771]  It started with the lockdowns of the third world.
[00:40:25.831 --> 00:40:27.152]  It started with the UN organizing them.
[00:40:27.372 --> 00:40:29.093]  It started with the UN refugee centers.
[00:40:29.153 --> 00:40:30.493]  It started with Biden saying, come here.
[00:40:30.733 --> 00:40:33.255]  It started with them getting rid of the border wall.
[00:40:33.455 --> 00:40:37.757]  It started with them putting ICE under the control of NGOs of the UN.
[00:40:40.158 --> 00:40:50.063]  It didn't start with a madman in Texas, the governor, who is milquetoast and weak compared to people like Trump.
[00:40:51.189 --> 00:40:54.330]  And I'll take Abbott, I'm not saying he's evil, I'm just saying he's weak.
[00:40:57.011 --> 00:41:03.334]  Abbott got a giant settlement for a tree that fell on him, one of the biggest in state history, and then he passed tort reform right after it.
[00:41:04.054 --> 00:41:08.356]  Which, by the way, I think we need tort reform and caps on things, but the point is, is the man is a joke.
[00:41:10.497 --> 00:41:11.817]  But I'm not going to go into that now.
[00:41:11.877 --> 00:41:13.058]  The point is, he's a hypocrite.
[00:41:15.079 --> 00:41:16.679]  But he's nothing compared to these people.
[00:41:17.059 --> 00:41:18.400]  So let's go back to this BS artist.
[00:41:21.531 --> 00:41:31.478]  I regret getting- Started with a madman down in Texas decided he wanted to bus people up to New York City.
[00:41:31.298 --> 00:41:44.817]   City. 110,000 migrants. We have to feed, clothes, house, educate the children, wash their laundry
[00:41:44.817 --> 00:41:48.578]  sheets, give them everything they need, healthcare.
[00:41:49.316 --> 00:41:57.080]  And this team here, we stated, let's do everything possible before we have to push it out into neighborhoods and communities.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:01.583]  Month after month, I stood up and I said, this is going to come to a neighborhood near you.
[00:42:03.264 --> 00:42:03.764]  Well, we're here.
[00:42:05.063 --> 00:42:05.483]  We're here.
[00:42:06.184 --> 00:42:11.849]  We're getting no support on this national crisis.
[00:42:12.809 --> 00:42:14.451]  And we're receiving no support.
[00:42:14.491 --> 00:42:16.092]  And let me tell you something, New Yorkers.
[00:42:18.254 --> 00:42:23.518]  Never in my life have I had a problem that I did not see an ending to.
[00:42:24.759 --> 00:42:25.820]  I don't see an ending to this.
[00:42:27.542 --> 00:42:28.643]  I don't see an ending to this.
[00:42:29.763 --> 00:42:33.727]  This issue will destroy New York City.
[00:42:34.827 --> 00:42:36.227]  Destroy New York City.
[00:42:36.947 --> 00:42:40.548]  We're getting 10,000 migrants a month.
[00:42:43.249 --> 00:43:01.613]  One time we were just getting Venezuela, now we're getting Ecuador, now we're getting Russian-speaking coming through Mexico, now we're getting Western Africa, now we're getting people from all over the globe have made their minds up that they're going to come through the southern part of the border and come into New York City.
[00:43:02.688 --> 00:43:05.110]  And everyone is saying it's New York City's problem.
[00:43:07.191 --> 00:43:10.333]  Every community in this city is going to be impacted.
[00:43:10.514 --> 00:43:11.955]  This is so incredible.
[00:43:11.975 --> 00:43:16.038]  His party does all this, and then he blames Texas.
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:19.780]  Wow.
[00:43:22.102 --> 00:43:24.964]  It's like Democrats collapse their states and then move to our states and do this.
[00:43:25.004 --> 00:43:27.366]  I mean, it's like, it's incredible.
[00:43:27.646 --> 00:43:29.087]  Hey, Mayor.
[00:43:29.427 --> 00:43:30.348]  Hey, Governor's there.

[00:44:53.962 --> 00:44:54.983]  I've been shadowbanned.
[00:44:55.804 --> 00:44:57.085]  I've been called a liar.
[00:44:57.825 --> 00:45:01.268]  I've been silenced on virtually every platform created by man.
[00:45:01.949 --> 00:45:04.271]  My life has been threatened, repeatedly.
[00:45:04.851 --> 00:45:07.433]  They've tried to destroy me, but I've survived.
[00:45:08.975 --> 00:45:11.036]  And that's why I'm joining Mug Club.
[00:45:12.558 --> 00:45:15.080]  The re-platforming begins now!

[00:45:29.764 --> 00:45:33.666]  But first, I want to play a clip that I'll get more to in the next segment of R.L.
[00:45:33.686 --> 00:45:34.046]  King Jr.
[00:45:34.086 --> 00:45:38.889]  because the Democrats are officially blocking him out of the process.
[00:45:39.809 --> 00:45:40.470]  No debates.
[00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:49.015]  Trying to block him from the process of being in the states, the primaries.
[00:45:49.515 --> 00:45:51.937]  This is total election meddling.
[00:45:51.957 --> 00:45:52.257]  Here it is.
[00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:57.694]  It's pretty clear that the DNC does not want a primary.
[00:45:57.714 --> 00:46:11.968]  I don't want to say that they want a coronation, but I think that that's a fair way to put it, actually.
[00:46:16.938 --> 00:46:23.863]  Essentially they're fixing up the process so that it makes it almost impossible to have democracy function.
[00:46:23.883 --> 00:46:36.653]  They're effectively disenfranchising the Democratic voters from having any choice in who becomes the Democratic nominee.
[00:46:37.974 --> 00:47:02.259]   So two of the things they've done to date is they've moved the The Iowa primary, they've made rules that if anybody campaigns in Iowa or sets foot, any candidate sets foot in the state of Iowa or sets foot in the state of New Hampshire, that none of the votes that are cast for that candidate will be tallied.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:07.243]  In other words, any delegate that I win in New Hampshire or Iowa would go instead.
[00:47:08.838 --> 00:47:09.879]  Uh, to the president.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:21.308]  And now they're trying to change it so that if I campaign in New Hampshire, that none of the votes cast for me in Georgia will count.
[00:47:21.368 --> 00:47:25.471]  And that's significant because it's hard to win the nomination without Georgia.
[00:47:26.752 --> 00:47:28.033]  What is the logic?
[00:47:28.093 --> 00:47:59.778]   Well, they're rigging it so that, you know, effectively, you know, we're looking at The tabulations now that look like if you add up all the superdelegates that they control and all of the automatic delegates that just go to the party and go to the president, I would have to win almost 80% of all of the states in order to beat President Biden, even if he only wins 20%.
[00:48:01.576 --> 00:48:05.079]  And yet you continue on.
[00:48:05.099 --> 00:48:10.464]  So what is your strategy then in light of this for defeating President Biden?
[00:48:10.604 --> 00:48:16.989]  You know, these rules will not be finalized until September 14th.
[00:48:17.089 --> 00:48:20.872]  And we've written the DNC protesting.
[00:48:20.912 --> 00:48:45.888]   I mean, there's some really wild things that they're now considering, including forcing me I actually pay for the primaries and their logic is that they don't need a primary because they already have a candidate and therefore I'm costing them all this money and that money should be paid for by me and maybe Marianne Williamson.
[00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:51.353]  So it's not, you know, it's a process that is rigged.
[00:48:52.654 --> 00:49:07.143]  You know, we live at a time in American history when a lot of Americans think that democracy is broken, that the system, the political system is rigged, and that there's not really any democracy.
[00:49:07.203 --> 00:49:14.929]  And unfortunately, the DNC is taking a lot of steps that confirm that outlook.
[00:49:15.874 --> 00:49:28.281]  If the decision holds for the current, you know, sort of primary structure with the DNC, what is the best, what is the route to victory for you against President Biden?
[00:49:28.301 --> 00:49:53.822]   You know, if the, if the, if the DNC is going to make it, is going to rig it so that it is simply impossible for anybody The challenge, President Biden, and you know, I need to look at other alternatives because I can't go back to the people support me and to my donors and say, you know, I'm in, you know, I'm just going to, I'm in this to make a point.
[00:49:53.942 --> 00:49:57.043]  I need to, I need to show them a road to victory.
[00:49:57.224 --> 00:50:00.065]  What kind of alternatives would you be exploring, Mr. Kennedy?
[00:50:00.085 --> 00:50:03.948]  Well, you know, I don't know exactly because I want to see what the DNC does.
[00:50:06.023 --> 00:50:11.627]  I want to see if they make it a fair contest.
[00:50:11.647 --> 00:50:20.171]  I'm not asking that it be 100% fair, but I'm asking that there at least be a chance that it be plausible.
[00:50:20.392 --> 00:50:21.752]  It's Friday, September 8, 2023.
[00:50:22.473 --> 00:50:25.174]  We're now into hour number two.
[00:50:25.234 --> 00:50:26.115]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:50:26.135 --> 00:50:27.236]  Very blessed and honored to be here.
[00:50:27.256 --> 00:50:30.077]  I want to thank you all again for commissioning me in this fight.
[00:50:31.138 --> 00:50:32.819]  You're the reason we've had all this success together.
[00:50:34.011 --> 00:50:38.493]  So don't forget how important you are and how much I appreciate you.
[00:50:39.733 --> 00:50:46.816]  As dark as the days are and as hard as the fight is, I know you've got my back and I am very humbly thankful to you.
[00:50:48.876 --> 00:50:56.019]  From the bottom of my heart, from the core of my soul, I appreciate you and I love you.
[00:50:57.939 --> 00:50:59.060]  All right, look.
[00:51:00.478 --> 00:51:04.599]  I didn't want to be right about this, but obviously I don't just make up whistleblowers.
[00:51:05.499 --> 00:51:06.979]  I don't make up information.
[00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:11.960]  I get things wrong sometimes, or the globalists change course and then people say I was wrong.
[00:51:12.901 --> 00:51:28.184]  But I knew 18, 19 days ago when I got on air and said I've talked to multiple whistleblowers, well technically one whistleblower, I called the other people and said, you know, hey, they're going to roll out the COVID protocol, the COVID tyranny again, that it was happening.
[00:51:29.736 --> 00:51:32.777]  And basically immediately they launched their operation.
[00:51:32.797 --> 00:51:33.617]  It was all pre-planned.
[00:51:34.557 --> 00:51:38.619]  I was told middle of September, but I guess it was a drumbeat rollout up to that.
[00:51:39.339 --> 00:51:42.120]  So think about all the things that that entails.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:55.104]  Think about the mask and the small businesses shut down and the pushing the poison shots and the ventilators and not letting families see their family members and the third world collapsing further.
[00:51:56.844 --> 00:51:59.085]  Think about what that signifies, what that means.
[00:52:00.635 --> 00:52:03.976]  And now, if I tried to play all these clips, it would take the rest of the show.
[00:52:04.137 --> 00:52:05.277]  You see it, it's everywhere.
[00:52:06.077 --> 00:52:11.380]  The UN saying, oh, it's worse than we thought, we need new protocols and control again, and the tools we had before.
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.821]  The White House saying, hey, we're going back to the way it was, it never changed.
[00:52:15.561 --> 00:52:19.403]  So they're not saying the protocols are back, they're saying they never left.
[00:52:23.365 --> 00:52:24.585]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:52:26.186 --> 00:52:30.082]   So, What is the point then of opposing it?
[00:52:30.282 --> 00:52:50.107]  Well, because we're not going to just sit here, flat-footed as I've said, and not point out all the lies of Fauci, all the lies of the CDC, and the FDA, and the suppression of therapeutics, and all the terrible things they did, and the toxic shots, and the 20 million dead, and just all the rest of it.
[00:52:51.608 --> 00:53:07.352]   But the good news is, Without even looking for the news, I can't go anywhere without political cartoons and news articles and even CNN skewering, impaling Fauci a few days ago.
[00:53:07.372 --> 00:53:10.014]  We didn't play the clip because I just can't stand to even watch CNN.
[00:53:11.937 --> 00:53:18.902]  There was a clip on InfoWars where Samir Khanesh just says, well the studies say masks don't work.
[00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:20.162]  Here they are, here they are, here they are.
[00:53:20.463 --> 00:53:25.606]  And you said before they didn't work four years ago, three years ago, but now you say they do and we need them again.
[00:53:25.866 --> 00:53:26.747]  You're full of crap.
[00:53:27.707 --> 00:53:30.950]  What does that signify when CNN, it's not just that one show.
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:32.801]  They're saying this is BS.
[00:53:33.421 --> 00:53:35.282]  People know it's hurting children.
[00:53:35.342 --> 00:53:36.843]  People know it's destroying the economy.
[00:53:37.423 --> 00:53:43.287]  People know, and you can see in the eyes of these talk show hosts, they'll probably get fired for it, but they're sick of it.
[00:53:45.528 --> 00:53:52.773]  And we just did like the nurses and military people that quit and said no up front, enough of us, their system will grind to a halt.
[00:53:53.353 --> 00:53:56.795]  They don't care if some get purged, but they need main compliance.
[00:53:57.956 --> 00:53:59.577]  So this is the time to say no.
[00:54:00.515 --> 00:54:24.201]  So, I'll officially declare today, obviously our whistleblower was right, and I don't see them changing course, so the 15th is in seven days, and I would expect, as they're so arrogant, the TSA will remask on the 15th, and by the middle of October, Biden will try a masking order via any federally controlled transportation system, like flights.
[00:54:24.801 --> 00:54:29.522]  And the nurses will be back dancing, and you know, the whole nine yards.
[00:54:30.618 --> 00:54:37.141]  And I wish that was the case, but it's not an at least, because this is not an at least.
[00:54:37.942 --> 00:54:39.923]  This really messed them up.
[00:54:40.023 --> 00:54:41.163]  I've been on there 29 years.
[00:54:42.204 --> 00:54:49.407]  And I got to tell you, I think this of everything we've done, 9-11 was big to expose.
[00:54:51.598 --> 00:54:53.239]  Bohemian Grove was big to expose.
[00:54:53.919 --> 00:55:00.403]  I mean, there's hundreds of big stories that we've been really effective in at changing the paradigm and waking people.
[00:55:01.023 --> 00:55:11.409]  But I gotta say, listeners getting excited about this two and a half weeks ago, or I guess, wait a minute, it's Friday.
[00:55:11.449 --> 00:55:12.490]  I keep saying two and a half weeks ago.
[00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:13.991]  Three weeks ago, sorry.
[00:55:15.232 --> 00:55:16.112]  Sorry, I got that wrong.
[00:55:16.552 --> 00:55:21.252]   Three weeks ago, You, this is such an illustrative event.
[00:55:21.272 --> 00:55:23.459]  This is such a learning moment for all of us.
[00:55:23.961 --> 00:55:24.984]  You got excited.
[00:55:26.747 --> 00:55:28.768]  I was theatrical, which I don't tend to do.
[00:55:29.128 --> 00:55:34.511]  I come out of the show, I come into the show with the most hardcore stuff.
[00:55:34.791 --> 00:55:37.953]  I don't say, hey, tune in later, we're going to cover this, it's really big.
[00:55:38.613 --> 00:55:40.174]  I just inherently don't do that.
[00:55:40.795 --> 00:55:43.416]  I should do more of that, because humans are what humans are.
[00:55:43.936 --> 00:55:47.018]  And I'm the same way, and I'm watching some show, and they go, next hour, it's really big.
[00:55:47.038 --> 00:55:49.139]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now.
[00:55:49.199 --> 00:55:51.921]  I'm like, yeah, tune in, this is about to be big.
[00:55:51.961 --> 00:55:54.182]  Tucker's going to have Obama's boyfriend on tonight.
[00:55:55.629 --> 00:55:56.670]  That's what promos are about.
[00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:57.650]  It's what trailers are about.
[00:55:57.670 --> 00:56:07.536]  It's why they put trailers on TV for a new movie coming out, or put ads on about a new truck coming out, or a new system of golf clubs, or, you know, whatever they're selling.
[00:56:07.576 --> 00:56:10.458]  Well, I'm selling truth and justice and freedom and resistance.
[00:56:13.039 --> 00:56:16.781]  So, I just want to thank the audience, just like I just did, because, I mean, you're everything.
[00:56:16.841 --> 00:56:18.562]  I mean, you need to get it straight.
[00:56:18.782 --> 00:56:19.423]  I'm the tail.
[00:56:20.003 --> 00:56:21.164]  You're the dog.
[00:56:22.236 --> 00:56:23.997]  Not, oh thank you Alex, you're so great.
[00:56:24.057 --> 00:56:24.278]  No.
[00:56:24.958 --> 00:56:27.600]  When you decide, I'm just like you, want freedom.
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:29.081]  I'm not that special.
[00:56:30.042 --> 00:56:32.504]  When you decide, it's about you.
[00:56:34.486 --> 00:56:42.431]  And I know I'm hammering this point probably too much for most of you, you get it, but I want people that are not fully conscious of this to understand, it's about you.
[00:56:43.132 --> 00:56:44.133]  It's about you.
[00:56:44.773 --> 00:56:50.837]  It's about you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.
[00:56:51.377 --> 00:56:52.478]  You have the power.
[00:56:52.898 --> 00:56:53.959]  You have the will.
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:56.441]  You together can do anything.
[00:56:57.222 --> 00:57:20.014]   You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, Get it through your head.
[00:57:20.914 --> 00:57:22.175]  Like, I love Rob due to death.
[00:57:22.855 --> 00:57:34.921]  One of my best friends worked like 18 hours yesterday to put out this two and a half hour report we shot that's at jonescrotter.com right now and the whole global takeover plan and the mad scientist program and how to stop him.
[00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:37.803]  But once you're not in the habit of doing something, you don't do it.
[00:57:38.567 --> 00:57:44.175]  So, yesterday I said, hey, when you're done with the trailer, and you're done with it, make sure it's in the computer this morning so I can play it.
[00:57:44.815 --> 00:57:48.200]  I come in, I go, hey, did you put the trailer in the computer?
[00:57:48.721 --> 00:57:49.181]  What trailer?
[00:57:49.822 --> 00:57:50.483]  Go get the trailer.
[00:57:51.204 --> 00:57:51.905]  When was the trailer done?
[00:57:52.005 --> 00:57:52.566]  Hours ago?
[00:57:52.886 --> 00:57:53.607]  I stayed up all night.
[00:57:54.208 --> 00:57:56.091]  Okay, that's the final part of it.
[00:57:57.213 --> 00:58:02.136]  It's like having a nine month, you know, pregnancy woman and then you, instead of her having the baby, you abort it.
[00:58:02.656 --> 00:58:06.098]  You've got to put it in the computer so we know it's there to play it.
[00:58:06.138 --> 00:58:06.979]  And I'm not bitching.
[00:58:07.399 --> 00:58:10.981]  I'm using that as an analogy of you.
[00:58:12.542 --> 00:58:18.065]  Just like, we don't think to actually, actually put out what we make.
[00:58:18.746 --> 00:58:20.487]  It's important to put out what we make.
[00:58:21.247 --> 00:58:21.868]  That's like 90% of it.
[00:58:24.392 --> 00:58:25.433]  It's important.
[00:58:26.093 --> 00:58:26.874]  This is my pet peeve.
[00:58:27.074 --> 00:58:28.154]  I blew up yesterday about this.
[00:58:28.495 --> 00:58:29.875]  They made these clips, these great reports.
[00:58:29.915 --> 00:58:30.596]  I was like, where are they?
[00:58:31.416 --> 00:58:32.897]  Oh, they're not on the computer.
[00:58:34.238 --> 00:58:35.619]  But that's a side issue.
[00:58:35.739 --> 00:58:36.459]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:58:36.539 --> 00:58:37.500]  I'm saying it's an analogy.
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:38.501]  Or it's a parallel.
[00:58:38.581 --> 00:58:39.361]  It's a factoid.
[00:58:42.529 --> 00:58:49.353]  Listeners think like, oh, it's Alex Jones or Rand Paul or Senator Hawley or Donald Trump's going to save us.
[00:58:49.573 --> 00:58:50.073]  No, folks.
[00:58:51.013 --> 00:58:53.935]  It's you going to the city council and the school board.
[00:58:54.015 --> 00:58:56.556]  It's you filing suit against the leftist group.
[00:58:56.816 --> 00:58:57.837]  It's you protesting.
[00:58:57.877 --> 00:58:58.998]  It's you financially supporting.
[00:58:59.238 --> 00:59:00.018]  It's you praying.
[00:59:00.358 --> 00:59:01.879]  It's you spending time with your family.
[00:59:02.179 --> 00:59:03.420]  It's you breaking with the system.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:09.203]  It's you never going to another big Hollywood movie again, unless you're going to review it and attack it.
[00:59:13.331 --> 00:59:14.552]  I used to go see movies every week.
[00:59:14.852 --> 00:59:25.938]  One of my favorite things growing up, my dad was a hard-working guy, but he would always cut time out to do things for me, or take me camping, or hunting, or water skiing, or wakeboarding.
[00:59:27.399 --> 00:59:27.939]  Skip this break.
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:29.260]  Sorry if I told you it was late.
[00:59:30.481 --> 00:59:42.235]   And I forget what I was going to say, but the point is, is that What was I saying about my dad?
[00:59:42.595 --> 00:59:46.058]  Why was I going off a story about him being busy but still spending time with me?
[00:59:46.078 --> 00:59:48.259]  Ah, it doesn't matter.
[00:59:50.961 --> 00:59:59.728]  The point here is that we have to do this.
[01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:04.992]  And things are only going to get worse if we don't do this.
[01:00:07.073 --> 01:00:07.834]  And I sit back.
[01:00:10.049 --> 01:00:13.611]  And I look at the insurance actuarial numbers, they're the most accurate numbers out there.
[01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:16.452]  That's what insurance companies make decisions on.
[01:00:16.492 --> 01:00:18.373]  They're like 99% accurate.
[01:00:20.374 --> 01:00:24.376]  On how long does a smoker live, that's a certain group that has this diet.
[01:00:24.596 --> 01:00:27.897]  I mean, they know down statistically to the day you're going to die, basically.
[01:00:28.818 --> 01:00:32.720]  And their numbers are 44% increase in death in every country that took the shot.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:37.302]  44% increase on the previous death number.
[01:00:39.278 --> 01:00:50.040]  And I just sit back and I go, man, Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and the UN and the Pentagon, people running it, they got balls the size of Jupiter.
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.441]  I mean, that's crazy.
[01:00:53.861 --> 01:00:54.761]  But you know why they did it?
[01:00:54.781 --> 01:00:55.781]  They understand psychology.
[01:00:57.061 --> 01:01:00.682]  How do you even get your mind around they just killed 20 million people?
[01:01:01.842 --> 01:01:03.122]  That's what the numbers are on the shots.
[01:01:04.523 --> 01:01:06.023]  I mean, that's pretty wicked.
[01:01:10.933 --> 01:01:16.515]  But Zelensky got caught shooting missiles last year into Poland and called for nuclear war and said the Russians did it.
[01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:17.576]  That's crazy too.
[01:01:17.916 --> 01:01:20.557]  And the point is, it's not that Zelensky's bad, he is.
[01:01:21.718 --> 01:01:23.438]  It's not that Bill Gates is bad, he is.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.841]  It's that we have not restrained these psychotics.
[01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:43.672]   And that's the most important thing I want to say here today is Of course, almost everybody that isn't pure evil is going to join us.
[01:01:44.032 --> 01:01:49.035]  Because it's going to become blaringly obvious, it already has, that we are up the creek right now.
[01:01:49.955 --> 01:01:55.858]  And that we got lunatics, people that make Hitler look like a choir boy, running things.
[01:01:57.699 --> 01:02:00.881]  And it's because they're weak.
[01:02:02.031 --> 01:02:05.332]  And they've never really done anything in their life other than join the power structure.
[01:02:05.912 --> 01:02:09.353]  And the power structure only wants ruthlessness and subservience.
[01:02:10.133 --> 01:02:14.754]  But they themselves can't even see how they're destroying their own futures.
[01:02:16.975 --> 01:02:23.656]  But they get this thrill feeling like they're part of the club.
[01:02:26.697 --> 01:02:32.442]   And It's that wanting to belong thing that gets all these followers to join them.
[01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:45.027]  That's why they don't want conservatives, or Christians, or nationalists, or capitalists, or just pro-human folks, pro-God people, to have publications, or have websites, or have news, because they want you to feel all alone.
[01:02:46.248 --> 01:02:48.449]  And they want to make the cool club Hollywood.
[01:02:48.889 --> 01:02:50.730]  They want to make the cool club the New World Order.
[01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:55.990]   They want to make the cool club their agenda to get all these idiots to get on board with it.
[01:02:55.990 --> 01:03:04.068]  So that's where we are.
[01:03:04.068 --> 01:03:14.068]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:03:06.594 --> 01:03:10.636]  But I look at this news, and I'll get to the vaccine news, which is a vaccine in a moment.
[01:03:12.276 --> 01:03:13.457]  But just look at this article.
[01:03:14.337 --> 01:03:15.198]  This is wild.
[01:03:15.218 --> 01:03:23.922]  Remember that crazy witch lady that was on TV, the foreman of the grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia?
[01:03:24.762 --> 01:03:26.803]  And she is a witch on her own website.
[01:03:27.863 --> 01:03:32.268]   And she says, I just felt powerful having Trump under my control.
[01:03:33.969 --> 01:03:49.918]   She's a totally disconnected lunatic who has no shame and has no idea what she's involved in, and now we learn that she wanted to indict A bunch of Republican Senators.
[01:03:49.938 --> 01:03:51.219]  Remember the Democrats?
[01:03:51.459 --> 01:03:52.439]  They told her to do this.
[01:03:52.499 --> 01:03:53.280]  They tried to get it to happen.
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:54.480]  Remember?
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:04:01.063]  They said Ted Cruz should be expelled from the Senate because he was at the Capitol on January 6th and he wanted a 10-day investigation that's in the law.
[01:04:01.864 --> 01:04:03.364]  They wanted Marjorie Taylor Greene expelled.
[01:04:03.585 --> 01:04:05.786]  They went to court and tried to bar her from running for office.
[01:04:05.806 --> 01:04:06.526]  Remember that last year?
[01:04:09.868 --> 01:04:17.289]   And so now it comes out in documents and the grand juror forewoman Is bragging.
[01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:19.750]  Well, we almost got Lindsey Graham.
[01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:23.972]  Lindsey Graham's a Georgian pro-war psychotic neocon.
[01:04:24.792 --> 01:04:29.714]  But because he's got an R before his name, these Democrats don't even know he's in their club.
[01:04:30.114 --> 01:04:31.335]  He's one of their top people.
[01:04:31.795 --> 01:04:32.755]  He's one of their generals.
[01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:34.616]  He's a made man.
[01:04:36.677 --> 01:04:39.898]  And they wanted him indicted along with Ted Cruz and everybody else.
[01:04:40.632 --> 01:04:42.033]  And by the way, they'll do that later.
[01:04:42.733 --> 01:04:45.174]  They want a one-party system.
[01:04:45.374 --> 01:04:46.654]  You know, I keep saying I'm going to play it again.
[01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:47.515]  I played it like a month ago.
[01:04:47.795 --> 01:04:55.758]  Get the Josh Hawley minute and a half clip left, Senator Hawley, where he explains this is a one-party system.
[01:04:55.778 --> 01:04:56.878]  They're outlawing their opposition.
[01:04:57.178 --> 01:04:58.619]  They're setting up a totalitarian system.
[01:04:58.939 --> 01:05:01.720]  Folks, that's not somebody blowing smoke at you.
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.500]  That's really happening.
[01:05:06.101 --> 01:05:07.362]  That's really going on.
[01:05:11.636 --> 01:05:13.297]  And then you look at this lunatic woman.
[01:05:13.697 --> 01:05:17.218]  She's like the woman that said Trump raped her 25 years ago.
[01:05:19.419 --> 01:05:21.240]  And Trump says, I don't know you.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.320]  And so they can't convict him of rape.
[01:05:23.601 --> 01:05:25.481]  So they get him for defamation $5 million.
[01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:27.902]  And she has another civil trial coming up.
[01:05:28.682 --> 01:05:29.923]  They pass laws, let her do it.
[01:05:31.083 --> 01:05:32.584]  Statute of limitations got rid of that.
[01:05:35.507 --> 01:05:38.812]  And she goes, with Anderson Cooper, she goes, rape's really hot.
[01:05:38.892 --> 01:05:39.473]  Women love it.
[01:05:40.014 --> 01:05:40.815]  You're really sexy.
[01:05:41.296 --> 01:05:42.838]  He's like all creeped out, goes to commercial.
[01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:46.023]  You can look the woman up online.
[01:05:46.083 --> 01:05:49.208]  She's a complete, stark, raving, mad lunatic.
[01:05:51.377 --> 01:05:52.537]  But that's who these people are.
[01:05:53.058 --> 01:06:03.701]  And we're letting the stark, raving, mad lunatics, like the woman who was going to run the Ministry of Truth, they already had it set up, it was going to be officially launched, singing Little Mermaid songs about how she's going to destroy the Republicans.
[01:06:04.241 --> 01:06:07.622]  They have no depth.
[01:06:07.762 --> 01:06:09.783]  They have no sense of how idiotic they are.
[01:06:10.023 --> 01:06:14.064]  They have no sense of the world they're bringing us into.
[01:06:16.225 --> 01:06:16.885]  Yeah, look at these people.
[01:06:21.015 --> 01:06:22.136]  They didn't believe Paulette Jones.
[01:06:22.156 --> 01:06:23.937]  They didn't believe Tara Reid.
[01:06:25.098 --> 01:06:26.479]  They didn't believe Larry Sinclair.
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.682]  They believed E. Jean Carroll.
[01:06:30.863 --> 01:06:31.883]  Look at that woman.
[01:06:34.325 --> 01:06:37.448]  She looks like that New York Times reporter that's always making stuff up about me.
[01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:38.909]  What's her name?
[01:06:38.949 --> 01:06:39.329]  I forget.
[01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:40.630]  Is that her sister?
[01:06:44.293 --> 01:06:45.634]  No witnesses, no reports.
[01:06:45.654 --> 01:06:47.996]  25 years later, he grabbed me.
[01:06:51.175 --> 01:06:53.497]  In a clothing changing room.
[01:06:54.497 --> 01:06:57.298]  And all Trump said was, I'm innocent, I don't know that woman.
[01:06:57.959 --> 01:06:58.819]  Defamation?
[01:06:58.859 --> 01:07:01.561]  How dare you say you didn't do that?
[01:07:02.461 --> 01:07:03.542]  Five million dollars.
[01:07:05.703 --> 01:07:07.304]  Then we have the Georgia lunatic.
[01:07:08.171 --> 01:07:13.454]  Georgia Grand Jury went insane, close quote, targeted Lindsey Graham and 38 others over J6.
[01:07:13.914 --> 01:07:25.060]  The Georgia Grand Jury, whose lunatic forewoman, came under fire in February after she went on national TV giddy with excitement and foreshadowing the coming indictments against former President Donald Trump and 18 other defendants.
[01:07:27.462 --> 01:07:31.144]  She went absolutely insane with indictment recommendations.
[01:07:31.244 --> 01:07:36.106]  It turns out the Grand Jury actually recommended charges against 39 people, including two U.S.
[01:07:36.146 --> 01:07:42.269]   Senators For Georgia, David Perdue, Kelly Loeffler, and others.
[01:07:42.489 --> 01:07:43.029]  Current U.S.
[01:07:43.049 --> 01:07:44.130]  Senator Lindsey Graham.
[01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:57.493]  Republican South Carolina, Georgia Secretary of State, Raffenberger said, called him at a 2020 election to ask if it was possible to invalidate mail-in ballots.
[01:07:58.113 --> 01:07:58.694]  Totally legal.
[01:07:59.674 --> 01:08:02.535]  But she wanted all these other people indicted.
[01:08:02.555 --> 01:08:03.895]  I mean, why not?
[01:08:05.213 --> 01:08:09.356]  They already put a thousand-plus people in jail, most of them non-violent from the Capitol.
[01:08:09.856 --> 01:08:11.097]  It's all about excess.
[01:08:11.137 --> 01:08:23.985]  It's like when the jury, when I was already found guilty by the judge in Connecticut, they said, OK, $1.5 billion, Alex Jones has to pay.
[01:08:24.325 --> 01:08:25.826]  It's a big, crazy number.
[01:08:26.447 --> 01:08:27.647]  And they went, hold my beer.
[01:08:29.008 --> 01:08:41.449]   And the litigators, the Democrat law firm, Senator Blumenthal, They put in a recommendation of $2.75 trillion.
[01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:44.091]  And I tell people that, and they go, that's not true.
[01:08:44.111 --> 01:08:44.651]  You just search.
[01:08:45.892 --> 01:08:52.617]  Alex Jones, $7.5, $7.65 trillion, whatever it is.
[01:08:53.098 --> 01:08:53.758]  Guys, type it in.
[01:08:53.778 --> 01:09:03.085]  It was in Bloomberg, it was in the New York Times, and they figured out that that was crazy, so they kind of pulled it back in about a week and changed the headlines, and we have copies of them all.
[01:09:04.758 --> 01:09:06.519]  That's the GDP of India, folks.
[01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:08.280]  A billion, five hundred million people.
[01:09:10.701 --> 01:09:15.583]  A billion, five hundred million people live off of that.
[01:09:16.703 --> 01:09:17.724]  That's their GDP.
[01:09:18.024 --> 01:09:30.309]  And they're saying, we want the GDP of India for somebody we made up all this stuff about, he never even said.
[01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:33.591]  But the things they claimed I said were protected under the First Amendment.
[01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:37.790]  And so you have to let that sink in that like there's no limit.
[01:09:38.190 --> 01:09:47.753]  Imagine going to the judge and saying, there it is, Connecticut judge asked for 2.75 trillion more for the Sandy Hook families.
[01:09:49.993 --> 01:09:52.634]  But that's, that's what they introduced.
[01:09:52.674 --> 01:10:02.837]  They said, we want 2.75 trillion to create the illusion that I have more money than the entire Indian economy or France.
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.382]  Well, at the time they published that, I had $2 million in the bank.
[01:10:07.442 --> 01:10:08.462]  Now I have basically nothing.
[01:10:09.703 --> 01:10:13.565]  But again, it's they can't help the over-the-topness.
[01:10:13.605 --> 01:10:17.627]  They can't help but just go as wild as possible.
[01:10:18.687 --> 01:10:19.648]  Two men can have a baby.
[01:10:19.948 --> 01:10:21.949]  Alex Jones can pay $2.75 trillion.
[01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:23.630]  The Easter Bunny is real.
[01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:24.831]  The Tooth Fairy is real.
[01:10:25.151 --> 01:10:26.091]  Santa Claus is real.
[01:10:26.612 --> 01:10:27.612]  Count Dracula is real.
[01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:29.933]  Flying pigs are real.
[01:10:31.734 --> 01:10:32.675]  Keebler elves are real.
[01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:35.231]  Loch Ness Monster's real.
[01:10:36.592 --> 01:10:37.493]  Two men can have a baby.
[01:10:38.074 --> 01:10:39.375]  Two women in prison can have a baby.
[01:10:40.456 --> 01:10:41.937]  Alex Jones peed on children's graves.
[01:10:41.997 --> 01:10:42.538]  Never did that.
[01:10:42.578 --> 01:10:43.158]  Never told anybody.
[01:10:43.178 --> 01:10:43.779]  Nobody ever did it.
[01:10:44.039 --> 01:10:44.580]  Doesn't matter.
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:45.520]  We just say it.
[01:10:45.761 --> 01:10:46.581]  We just do what we want.
[01:10:46.862 --> 01:10:47.863]  We just giggle and laugh.
[01:10:48.163 --> 01:10:48.883]  It's so much fun.
[01:10:49.164 --> 01:10:50.145]  We start war with Russia.
[01:10:50.385 --> 01:10:51.206]  We have nuclear war.
[01:10:51.446 --> 01:10:52.046]  We all die.
[01:10:52.226 --> 01:10:52.687]  We're trendy.
[01:10:52.847 --> 01:10:53.287]  Ha ha ha.
[01:10:53.528 --> 01:10:53.948]  Ha ha ha.
[01:10:54.228 --> 01:10:54.809]  It's so much fun.
[01:10:58.123 --> 01:11:02.284]  All right, I'm going to segue, because I said I'd hit the cup of news, and it's massive.
[01:11:02.685 --> 01:11:09.167]  We've got a special guest from Hawaii who's an emergency worker, very well-known emergency manager, and he's been there.
[01:11:09.187 --> 01:11:10.847]  He lives there, but he's been there throughout the whole deal.
[01:11:10.887 --> 01:11:13.608]  He's ready to come on and give an analysis of what really happened.
[01:11:13.628 --> 01:11:21.911]  We're not going to forget about the people of Lahaina, the people of Maui, and we're going to go over all that as well.
[01:11:22.864 --> 01:11:24.345]  But then you've got articles like this one.
[01:11:25.005 --> 01:11:29.208]  California wants to go all electric without having the ability to actually provide enough electricity.
[01:11:30.208 --> 01:11:37.372]  California, by estimates, by 2030, won't have enough renewable energy to power 20% of electric cars.
[01:11:38.313 --> 01:11:39.253]  But they don't care.
[01:11:39.293 --> 01:11:41.294]  They want them all to be electric cars.
[01:11:41.955 --> 01:11:42.855]  Because again, why?
[01:11:43.015 --> 01:11:44.136]  It's nonsensical.
[01:11:44.276 --> 01:11:45.016]  It's crazy.
[01:11:45.116 --> 01:11:45.957]  It's grandeur.
[01:11:48.564 --> 01:11:54.870]  Bill Gates for 20 years says, I've got programs spraying out of airplanes for the Department of Energy to block out the sun.
[01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:59.395]  We go, here's the meeting, here's the CIA briefing on C-SPAN, we need to have a debate about this and stop this.
[01:11:59.635 --> 01:12:00.335]  It doesn't exist.
[01:12:00.355 --> 01:12:02.578]  New York Times, there's no geoengineering, no chemtrailing.
[01:12:03.218 --> 01:12:12.948]  Then Bill Gates says, I want to block the sun out with arrays that we put out close to the sun with mirrors, because you can have a tiny dot out here, but it blocks a lot more light over here.
[01:12:15.816 --> 01:12:20.537]  And then Biden two months ago says, yeah, we're going to spend billions on blocking the sun out.
[01:12:20.557 --> 01:12:23.558]  I know I sounded crazy 20 years ago telling you Bill Gates wanted to do that.
[01:12:23.958 --> 01:12:25.078]  Now it's here, folks.
[01:12:25.358 --> 01:12:30.579]  You're like 2.75 trillion Alex Jones needs to pay for things he didn't do.
[01:12:31.119 --> 01:12:32.679]  Oh, let's block the sun out.
[01:12:32.819 --> 01:12:34.940]  Oh, let's cut trees down to save the earth now.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:35.720]  CNN.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.140]  You're like, that's so crazy.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.721]  They're crazy people.
[01:12:39.461 --> 01:12:45.342]  And the more delusional and wild a crazy person is, the crazier the stuff they ask for.
[01:12:46.923 --> 01:12:48.190]  They're lunatics!
[01:12:48.873 --> 01:12:49.979]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:55.003]  This is a message, they're trying to send a message loud and clear, and the message is don't mess with us.
[01:12:55.123 --> 01:12:56.164]  And why are they going after Trump?
[01:12:56.184 --> 01:12:57.065]  Because he messed with them.
[01:12:57.505 --> 01:12:58.907]  He challenged them across the board.
[01:12:58.927 --> 01:13:01.088]  He challenged their pro-war policies.
[01:13:01.128 --> 01:13:02.570]  He's challenged them on Ukraine.
[01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:16.542]  He's challenged their globalist agenda that's ripped off our working class for years, hollowed out the industrial base of this country, and made our workers in this country slaves compared to China and these other nations that have taken away our jobs, taken away our technology.
[01:13:17.122 --> 01:13:25.089]  Challenge all of that, and the message is, if you challenge them on this stuff, if you challenge them on these policies they hold dear, they will come after you.
[01:13:25.209 --> 01:13:29.993]  If you challenge them on their pro-abortion religion, they will come after you.
[01:13:30.433 --> 01:13:31.814]  So I think the message is real clear.
[01:13:32.174 --> 01:13:33.035]  Don't challenge us.
[01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:35.357]  Don't go to work for anybody who will challenge us.
[01:13:35.417 --> 01:13:40.401]  Don't vote for Donald Trump or anybody like him, or we'll treat you as a domestic terrorist.
[01:13:40.862 --> 01:13:48.207]   And I tell you what, Laura, this is a recipe for one-party rule in this country, and if that's the case, This isn't the United States of America anymore.
[01:13:48.367 --> 01:13:52.206]  our constitutional democracy doesn't exist anymore.
[01:13:52.206 --> 01:13:56.527]   All right, we're going to hit next segment, the persecution of Owen Schreier.
[01:13:56.527 --> 01:14:07.516]   Let that sink in. Owen may be spending a year in jail according to federal requests starting next Tuesday in
[01:14:07.516 --> 01:14:14.127]   federal court in the district of Mordor and Slorum.
[01:14:14.127 --> 01:14:22.195]   And I have the actual sentencing recommendations of the feds here where it says
[01:14:22.195 --> 01:14:27.617]   he's not remorseful, he still questions the election, we want jail for
[01:14:27.617 --> 01:14:29.567]  questioning election.
[01:14:27.664 --> 01:14:28.865]  Same things in the Trump indictments.
[01:14:29.806 --> 01:14:32.508]  That is a direct murder of the First Amendment.
[01:14:32.809 --> 01:14:33.830]  Where's the ACLU?
[01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:34.810]  Bought and paid for.
[01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:41.096]  They've gone full tyrant, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:42.757 --> 01:14:43.337]  And why not?
[01:14:43.438 --> 01:14:44.859]  They feel like they're insulated from tyranny.
[01:14:46.451 --> 01:14:46.951]  Themselves.
[01:14:47.751 --> 01:14:49.232]  They can do it to us all day.
[01:14:51.092 --> 01:14:55.414]  They're dumb enough to not know that's gonna blow back on them.
[01:14:55.454 --> 01:14:56.394]  And I don't care about them.
[01:14:56.414 --> 01:15:00.775]  So I don't take any solace in like, oh great, this will really hurt them later.
[01:15:00.815 --> 01:15:02.976]  I'm like, this is really bad.
[01:15:05.417 --> 01:15:06.997]  And I've used this analogy for many years.
[01:15:10.538 --> 01:15:16.020]  That you go to a public pool, and they gotta put so much chlorine in it because people are pissing in it.
[01:15:17.725 --> 01:15:22.488]  But if one person takes a dump in the pool, they gotta shut the pool down for a couple days and drain it.
[01:15:24.009 --> 01:15:28.972]  And they still have that, where a mentally retarded kid gets in the pool, takes a big crap in the pool, gotta close it.
[01:15:30.373 --> 01:15:33.535]  And that's really the best analogy or parallel of the globalists.
[01:15:34.676 --> 01:15:46.264]  They literally take dumps in the pool, they poison us with atrazine and fluoride and GMO and all this, and then they think they're exempt, but it closes the whole pool down.
[01:15:48.072 --> 01:16:07.098]  And so I just say to the Justice Department and the CIA, you guys aren't just taking a crap in the pool, you got septic tank companies, you know, that pump septic tanks, pulling up and just filling whole pools full of crap, telling us it's crystal clear Caribbean water, and it's not.
[01:16:07.118 --> 01:16:11.039]  And I'm just like, why do you think you get out of this yourself?
[01:16:11.559 --> 01:16:12.860]  Why would you act like this?
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:16.901]  Why would you promote open borders and pedophilia and all these drugs?
[01:16:18.069 --> 01:16:20.511]  And it's because they're inherently evil, folks.
[01:16:21.512 --> 01:16:22.593]  You take one look.
[01:16:22.653 --> 01:16:26.696]  In fact, get me the Georgia Bolton County Grand Jury kookaball lady.
[01:16:28.337 --> 01:16:28.878]  Get the footage.
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:33.542]  We always seem to play like a shot off a TV over the screen.
[01:16:33.582 --> 01:16:38.467]  Now there's HD ones where she starts gibbering and giggling and saying, I felt powerful.
[01:16:38.888 --> 01:16:40.409]  I wanted to see him in front of me.
[01:16:40.509 --> 01:16:41.670]  I wanted to dominate him.
[01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:50.900]  And she looks like she's auditioning to play the Wicked Witch of the West in the new Flying Monkey Wizard of Oz movie.
[01:16:51.983 --> 01:16:54.285]  I don't think they're remaking it, I'm just saying that hypothetically.
[01:16:55.046 --> 01:16:56.687]  They seem to remake everything, they haven't remade that.
[01:16:56.968 --> 01:16:59.570]  I mean, she's like, da-da-da-da-da-da, riding her bicycle.
[01:16:59.910 --> 01:17:02.313]  I'll get your dog, your little dog, and you too!
[01:17:04.234 --> 01:17:05.596]  I'll get you and your little dog too!
[01:17:06.837 --> 01:17:07.658]  And she's like, why?
[01:17:07.738 --> 01:17:09.019]  Why are you such a lunatic?
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:17.507]  Why would you go overthrow the Ukrainian government and start attacking the Russians for eight years, and then you wonder why they go ahead and attack you back?
[01:17:20.731 --> 01:17:30.977]  Because, look how she looks on the screen of your computer, and remember Peter Strzok, when he did all those weird demonic faces and wiggled around and laughed and giggled?
[01:17:32.018 --> 01:17:33.539]  Because he's a loser!
[01:17:33.839 --> 01:17:35.120]  He's a mental patient!
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:45.726]  But he loves the power of the system, and he loves being protected to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants.
[01:17:45.786 --> 01:17:46.866]  In fact, I'll just hit Owen now.
[01:17:47.827 --> 01:17:49.168]  Go ahead and roll the clip of this witch.
[01:17:52.995 --> 01:17:56.097]  Looking at- Did you personally want to hear from the former president?
[01:17:56.117 --> 01:18:01.980]  I wanted to hear from the former president, but honestly, I kind of wanted to subpoena the former president because I got to swear everybody in.
[01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:09.063]  And so I thought it'd be really cool to get 60 seconds with President Trump of me looking at him and being like, do you solemnly swear?
[01:18:09.083 --> 01:18:13.485]  And me getting to swear him in, I just- I kind of just thought that would be an awesome moment.
[01:18:14.646 --> 01:18:18.328]  And then he wanted to indict dozens of other leaders that had nothing to do with it.
[01:18:18.828 --> 01:18:20.289]  Because it made her feel powerful!
[01:18:24.042 --> 01:18:25.562]  And then there's worse clips of her.
[01:18:27.143 --> 01:18:29.023]  That's who we've got in charge.
[01:18:29.743 --> 01:18:31.144]  That lunatic right there.
[01:18:33.264 --> 01:18:36.425]  Like Sean Piggs on TV, he goes, who says we can't use nuclear weapons?
[01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:37.145]  They're very usable.
[01:18:37.185 --> 01:18:38.446]  We should nuke Russia right now.
[01:18:39.506 --> 01:18:40.866]  We shouldn't be afraid to use nukes.
[01:18:43.147 --> 01:18:45.007]  Okay, well Russia has two to one on our nukes.
[01:18:45.027 --> 01:19:13.086]   They got 30 submarines in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Atlantic Ocean, In the Pacific Ocean, and in four minutes, they can get an order and launch, and within five minutes of that, five minutes of launch, on average, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego are gone.
[01:19:14.006 --> 01:19:17.767]  Sub pops up ten miles off the Texas coast.
[01:19:18.789 --> 01:19:19.549]  Missiles launch.
[01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:21.930]  In three minutes, they hit Houston.
[01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:25.132]  In four minutes, they hit Dallas.
[01:19:26.012 --> 01:19:27.893]  In three and a half minutes, they hit Austin.
[01:19:28.493 --> 01:19:30.874]  In three and a half minutes, they hit San Antonio.
[01:19:33.676 --> 01:19:34.396]  Atlantic Ocean.
[01:19:35.176 --> 01:19:38.017]  And of course, they'll fire on up and hit the other cities.
[01:19:38.578 --> 01:19:39.518]  Right up to Illinois.
[01:19:41.579 --> 01:19:43.480]  That's while ICBMs come over the North Pole.
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.701]  Let's go to the Atlantic.
[01:19:47.793 --> 01:19:56.738]  They pop up 12 miles off the coast of Miami, in the Gulf, off the coast of our main military base there, Tampa.
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:04.842]  Within two minutes, Tampa is vaporized.
[01:20:05.823 --> 01:20:08.785]  Within two minutes, Miami is vaporized.
[01:20:09.744 --> 01:20:17.910]  Within two minutes of the missiles being launched, every major city in Florida is vaporized.
[01:20:19.971 --> 01:20:21.012]  Oh, but let's move it up the coast.
[01:20:21.932 --> 01:20:35.462]  Other submarines, remember there's at least 30 of them off our coast right now, holding up to 20 ICBM, cruise missiles, sea launch systems.
[01:20:37.186 --> 01:20:41.186]  that go up to Mach 10 and cannot be shot down.
[01:20:41.186 --> 01:20:55.186]   Submarines pop up off the coast and hit Georgia, Atlanta, South Carolina, North Carolina, Ohio.
[01:20:56.118 --> 01:20:59.700]  Oh, and you know where the real, real attack's gonna happen.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:11.911]   They got at least five submarines in the central Atlantic off the coast of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, D.C., Virginia.
[01:21:14.253 --> 01:21:21.253]  vaporized.
[01:21:21.253 --> 01:21:28.693]  And the Russians are crazy.
[01:21:28.693 --> 01:21:30.134]  And they're...
[01:21:30.154 --> 01:21:34.696]  Told their officers on those ships, we believe we're going to have to have a nuclear war.
[01:21:35.016 --> 01:21:41.759]  They're drilling, they're ready, they're 100 feet under the water, right now about to come up and launch the weapon.
[01:21:43.619 --> 01:21:48.862]  But don't worry, the FBI can swagger around with machine guns and beat up American citizens.
[01:21:49.602 --> 01:21:52.123]  Swagger around, they're real tough guys.
[01:21:53.323 --> 01:21:56.164]  While they're smuggling all the kids in, gang raping them.
[01:21:59.086 --> 01:22:00.086]  Very sad.
[01:22:00.086 --> 01:22:12.086]  [Music]
[01:22:12.086 --> 01:22:18.086]   If Hooten is yours, at least three submarines are tasked to take out DCS.
[01:22:18.464 --> 01:22:19.144]  and Virginia.
[01:22:19.944 --> 01:22:24.485]  They'll launch over 90 weapons in four minutes after the order.
[01:22:25.365 --> 01:22:29.046]  Within just a few minutes, they will slam into their targets.
[01:22:29.126 --> 01:22:34.107]  Even if we shoot half of them down, they're targeting four missiles on every target.
[01:22:35.007 --> 01:22:38.007]  Pentagon itself will be hit by at least 10.
[01:22:38.007 --> 01:22:41.007]  Please!
[01:22:41.007 --> 01:22:44.007]  Let me go!
[01:22:44.007 --> 01:22:50.276]   Many of the warheads are programmed, but if the missile's disabled, they'll still detonate in
[01:22:50.276 --> 01:22:53.007]   the atmosphere, creating electromagnetic pulse.
[01:22:53.007 --> 01:22:55.007]  Heh heh heh.
[01:22:54.491 --> 01:22:56.352]  And we're run by a bunch of psychotics.
[01:22:57.573 --> 01:22:59.614]  Our old elites were bad, but they were not like this.
[01:22:59.634 --> 01:23:00.935]  They would not do something this dangerous.
[01:23:01.335 --> 01:23:02.636]  Henry Kissinger's told them, stop.
[01:23:03.197 --> 01:23:03.997]  But they're not stopping.
[01:23:05.878 --> 01:23:09.458]   Because they've got so much power and they've gotten away with so much
[01:23:09.458 --> 01:23:35.077]   They believe they're invincible Most theologians agree
[01:23:35.878 --> 01:23:40.758]   That America does not exist during the tribulation [Loud explosion]
[01:23:40.758 --> 01:23:42.758]  [Screaming]
[01:23:43.627 --> 01:23:53.733]  I have had meetings with Bilderberg group members, household names, almost two years ago.
[01:23:55.193 --> 01:23:55.894]  Multiple meetings.
[01:23:57.835 --> 01:23:59.916]  Off record, I can't talk about the specifics.
[01:24:01.348 --> 01:24:08.469]  But they agreed that there's a good chance of nuclear war and they wanted to ask me where I thought they should go.
[01:24:09.309 --> 01:24:13.270]  I thought that was interesting because they're the ones that have bunkers all over the world.
[01:24:17.771 --> 01:24:26.552]  You ever been at a 50,000 square foot house with 60 foot black marble ceilings?
[01:24:27.733 --> 01:24:28.053]  I have.
[01:24:29.253 --> 01:24:30.173]  And I wasn't impressed.
[01:24:32.315 --> 01:24:36.296]  The point is, is that that's what's so frustrating about all this.
[01:24:38.196 --> 01:24:39.156]  Is this is all real.
[01:24:40.397 --> 01:24:41.997]  Those meetings I told you about are real.
[01:24:42.897 --> 01:24:44.857]  The whistleblower I told you about three weeks ago is real.
[01:24:45.018 --> 01:24:46.038]  You see it all happening now.
[01:24:47.118 --> 01:24:49.818]  And I'm telling you that I'm not being dramatic.
[01:24:52.299 --> 01:24:57.260]  There's a very good chance we're gonna have a nuclear war.
[01:25:00.588 --> 01:25:02.793]  And I have to be completely honest with you.
[01:25:05.881 --> 01:25:08.246]  My flesh is weak, my spirit strong.
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:14.663]  I wake up almost every night at about 3, 4 in the morning.
[01:25:14.883 --> 01:25:20.749]  General Flynn talked about it, how he wakes up with anxiety attacks for the first time ever about all this at about 3 a.m.
[01:25:20.789 --> 01:25:23.412]  I said, last week I read him, I said, yes sir, I do too.
[01:25:23.472 --> 01:25:24.693]  He said, I woke up at 3 a.m.
[01:25:24.713 --> 01:25:25.454]  and I couldn't go to sleep.
[01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:27.156]  I'm worried about nuclear war and all this.
[01:25:27.216 --> 01:25:28.677]  I said, yes sir, I woke up last night too.
[01:25:28.697 --> 01:25:29.038]  What time?
[01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:31.020]  3.15, me too.
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:32.421]  Get up, look at the clock, 3.15.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:41.360]   315. Didn't go back to sleep. And I've never, never been like that.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:42.920]  [APPLAUSE]
[01:25:42.523 --> 01:25:45.465]  And I have real guilt, because I'm not a guilty type person.
[01:25:45.485 --> 01:25:50.247]  I feel pretty good about what I've done in my life, and I've not been a coward, and I'm trying to be as honorable as I can.
[01:25:51.567 --> 01:25:52.988]  But my flesh is strong.
[01:25:55.829 --> 01:26:01.191]  And it's like, you need to get your family to South America or to some Pacific island now.
[01:26:01.351 --> 01:26:03.452]  Go, go, get out, get out, get out.
[01:26:04.273 --> 01:26:10.831]   Yesterday I got home at about six o'clock, went in, had dinner with my six and a half year old daughter and my
[01:26:10.831 --> 01:26:18.541]   wife and I looked at her and I said I had a very intense drive and premonition to
[01:26:18.541 --> 01:26:23.402]   get out of the United States and just hang it up but I said I don't want to do that I
[01:26:23.402 --> 01:26:28.881]   want to keep fighting but I said I really felt like it was the Holy Spirit but
[01:26:28.881 --> 01:26:30.990]  maybe just the danger level.
[01:26:31.149 --> 01:26:32.889]  I don't think the Holy Spirit was telling me to quit.
[01:26:33.370 --> 01:26:34.550]  She said, well, maybe it was a demon.
[01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:38.132]  You need to really pray about this and think about this longer, which is true.
[01:26:39.492 --> 01:26:47.435]  But I feel, I mean, I look at my beautiful six year old daughter, so innocent, so smart, so sweet.
[01:26:48.976 --> 01:26:52.737]  And then I look at my son and my older daughter, my middle daughter, they're so good.
[01:26:57.111 --> 01:27:02.572]  Every fiber of me says leave, get out of the United States.
[01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:07.854]  But my spirit says you're going to stay here and see this through.
[01:27:08.434 --> 01:27:15.276]  And then I see the arrogant left and their lawyers and their agents and their people and they have no idea this is going on.
[01:27:15.296 --> 01:27:22.296]  They think it's completely funny.
[01:27:22.296 --> 01:27:24.296]  But when I have these urges...
[01:27:24.296 --> 01:27:34.296]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:27:25.697 --> 01:27:28.559]  I almost always follow the urges of the spirit, not the urges of the flesh.
[01:27:28.579 --> 01:27:34.043]  But for the first time, I felt it was an urge of the spirit yesterday.
[01:27:34.563 --> 01:27:35.984]  I'm just telling you, because I don't know what to do.
[01:27:37.685 --> 01:27:42.248]  Maybe jump the phones up next week and ask, well, what can we do?
[01:27:42.829 --> 01:27:48.212]  But I've never had it at a spirit level, and it really freaked me out.
[01:27:49.193 --> 01:27:50.214]  So I couldn't sleep last night.
[01:27:50.970 --> 01:27:56.893]  It's been about 10, woke up at like midnight, went back to bed, woke up at like 3, I didn't get any sleep last night.
[01:27:58.714 --> 01:28:07.098]  And I got up this morning, and I was so upset, I went in the bathroom, and I started vomiting.
[01:28:11.061 --> 01:28:13.522]  And it was my physiology trying to change.
[01:28:15.117 --> 01:28:16.098]  The situation.
[01:28:16.118 --> 01:28:22.263]  Your body knows you're being poisoned, you're being attacked, and it wants to say, I'm under attack, I'm gonna throw up, must have been something I ate.
[01:28:22.483 --> 01:28:25.906]  And I'm not like some bulimic folks, I don't throw up very often.
[01:28:26.306 --> 01:28:27.447]  I don't have trouble when I have the flu.
[01:28:27.827 --> 01:28:34.393]  And I puked and puked and puked, nothing but bile, and hugged the toilet for like 20 minutes.
[01:28:34.413 --> 01:28:36.654]  And my eyes were watering.
[01:28:37.574 --> 01:28:38.435]  And like 5 a.m.
[01:28:38.475 --> 01:29:07.153]   my wife woke up she heard me and she came in I'm laying on the bathroom floor with puke on me and she says are you are what's up what's happening and I said I told you I like this is such a big decision plus the southern hemisphere is not gonna be safe you know most of radiation will stay in the north but my cells and they're never wrong Are mad at me and they're telling me you need to leave with your family now.
[01:29:07.513 --> 01:29:08.333]  Do you hear me?
[01:29:09.814 --> 01:29:12.934]  And I'm like, well, we're going to fix this.
[01:29:13.254 --> 01:29:14.534]  My cells are like, no, you're not.
[01:29:15.315 --> 01:29:17.875]  So I don't know what the end game is.
[01:29:17.895 --> 01:29:20.556]  I don't even know why I'm saying this other than it happened.
[01:29:24.576 --> 01:29:31.698]  I just want you to know that I've never felt this much danger and look, I'm pretty tough.
[01:29:31.758 --> 01:29:31.998]  Okay.
[01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:37.323]  Some big guy starts a fight with me, it's the opposite.
[01:29:37.343 --> 01:29:43.585]  I'm gonna climb him, climb up on his ass, jump on him like a gorilla, and I'm gonna fuck him up, man.
[01:29:44.225 --> 01:29:47.846]  Like, I mean, you know, it's... I'm lined up.
[01:29:47.926 --> 01:29:48.486]  I'm primal.
[01:29:50.586 --> 01:29:55.707]  I don't have a fear of, like, a six-foot-seven giant muscular guy starts a fight with me for no reason.
[01:29:56.867 --> 01:29:58.348]  It's like, I'm not intimidated by that.
[01:29:58.388 --> 01:30:00.668]  In fact, I'm intimidated by little guys starting a fight with me.
[01:30:00.908 --> 01:30:01.828]  Like, why are they doing that?
[01:30:02.989 --> 01:30:04.069]  I accept the challenge.
[01:30:07.981 --> 01:30:14.926]  But I said on Jack Posubik's show today, I've said I'm a fearless person, and it's really true.
[01:30:14.986 --> 01:30:16.487]  I don't have fear of things I need to do.
[01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:19.730]  But I'm in it for the first time in my life.
[01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:31.550]   I don't know if the emotion is called fear, but Jesus at the Garden of Gethsemane, hours
[01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:36.269]   before he was taken into Roman custody, and a day later crucified.
[01:30:37.264 --> 01:30:38.345]  Knew what was about to happen to him.
[01:30:38.365 --> 01:30:41.547]  And he cried.
[01:30:41.567 --> 01:30:45.029]  And he said, may this cup pass from me.
[01:30:46.970 --> 01:30:47.831]  I don't want to do this.
[01:30:49.071 --> 01:30:51.553]  And his father said, you're gonna do it.
[01:30:53.794 --> 01:30:55.175]  And I don't compare myself to Christ.
[01:30:56.316 --> 01:31:00.018]  What I'm saying is, that is where I'm at, where I am.
[01:31:00.899 --> 01:31:04.481]  I was on an international, top Russian TV show two nights ago.
[01:31:06.049 --> 01:31:08.411]  And I wanted to go on there and cover big topics, the rest of it.
[01:31:08.811 --> 01:31:13.495]  And I couldn't believe I was on top Russian TV talking about nuclear war, and I started crying.
[01:31:16.697 --> 01:31:18.159]  And I wiped it away, and they didn't notice.
[01:31:18.179 --> 01:31:20.901]  The point was, is that that's the times we're in.
[01:31:21.281 --> 01:31:22.142]  That's where we are.
[01:31:22.702 --> 01:31:25.524]  Owen Schroeder, next week, the feds are asking for prison.
[01:31:25.865 --> 01:31:38.425]   And they say, in the recommended sentencing document, that I'll cover when we come back, Because he's not apologetic.
[01:31:38.766 --> 01:31:39.706]  He's not remorseful.
[01:31:42.968 --> 01:31:46.811]  He doesn't believe the election was real.
[01:31:48.232 --> 01:31:49.513]  And he called Joe Biden names.
[01:31:53.456 --> 01:32:00.120]  In America, the feds filed documents saying we want prison time for his speech.
[01:32:02.882 --> 01:32:04.203]  The dishonor of these people.
[01:32:05.911 --> 01:32:07.692]  The birthright they're murdering.
[01:32:10.193 --> 01:32:12.274]  Why stay here and fight for them?
[01:32:16.416 --> 01:32:18.017]  Let them have their nuclear armageddon.
[01:32:19.077 --> 01:32:19.938]  That's one thought.
[01:32:19.978 --> 01:32:20.678]  I'm not saying that.
[01:32:21.719 --> 01:32:22.719]  But that's the thing.
[01:32:22.859 --> 01:32:31.323]  They'll know when they're in their house and the windows all blow out and the electricity goes off and three days later their kids are dying of radiation poisoning.
[01:32:31.743 --> 01:32:33.124]  They'll know then, won't they?
[01:32:35.070 --> 01:32:36.070]  We'll be right back.
[01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:51.070]  It's just a mask.
[01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:53.000]  It's just six feet.
[01:32:53.741 --> 01:32:55.602]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[01:32:56.322 --> 01:32:58.023]  It's just non-essential workers.
[01:32:58.744 --> 01:33:00.585]  It's just until we work it out.
[01:33:01.285 --> 01:33:02.166]  It's just a bar.
[01:33:02.806 --> 01:33:03.987]  It's just a restaurant.
[01:33:04.969 --> 01:33:06.150]  It's just nursing homes.
[01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:07.971]  It's just schools.
[01:33:08.732 --> 01:33:11.333]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[01:33:12.014 --> 01:33:13.835]  It's just until the cases go down.
[01:33:14.595 --> 01:33:16.217]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[01:33:16.857 --> 01:33:18.958]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[01:33:19.679 --> 01:33:21.340]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:26.143]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[01:33:26.703 --> 01:33:28.385]  It's just churches and mosques.
[01:33:29.165 --> 01:33:30.165]  It's just singing.
[01:33:30.845 --> 01:33:32.846]  It's just travel.
[01:33:33.546 --> 01:33:35.266]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[01:33:36.006 --> 01:33:37.287]  It's just for the greater good.
[01:33:37.967 --> 01:33:41.247]  It's just fact-checking, not censorship.
[01:33:41.868 --> 01:33:43.288]  It's just mandatory.
[01:33:43.868 --> 01:33:45.068]  It isn't just at all.
[01:33:45.708 --> 01:33:49.069]  Visit DefendJones.com to help fight back today.
[01:33:50.249 --> 01:34:02.467]   Our special guest from Hawaii, an emergency worker, With a long credited background who's there and lives there is gonna be joining us coming up because they want us to move on to the next story and forget about it.
[01:34:02.567 --> 01:34:03.228]  No, we're not going to.
[01:34:05.336 --> 01:34:07.097]  But let me get into Owen Schroer.
[01:34:07.537 --> 01:34:10.478]  So you read this Gateway Pundit article and you think, is it really that bad?
[01:34:10.519 --> 01:34:12.279]  No, it's... I love the Gateway Pundit, they're great people.
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:13.820]  It's way worse than they're saying, okay?
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:16.361]  So, no, the story's not accurate, it's way worse.
[01:34:17.022 --> 01:34:20.583]  InfoWars host Owen Schroer pleads guilty to role in January 6th riot.
[01:34:21.344 --> 01:34:22.584]  They're gonna put him through a whole D.C.
[01:34:22.624 --> 01:34:23.445]  trial, the rest of it.
[01:34:24.285 --> 01:34:30.008]  Statements of offensive details, complete absence of criminal conduct.
[01:34:32.034 --> 01:34:38.057]  And they go on to say because of his political speech, they're calling for jail time.
[01:34:38.077 --> 01:34:44.641]  DOJ, prosecutors seeking 120 days in prison at least for Owen Schroer for speaking out against stolen 2020 election.
[01:34:44.661 --> 01:34:46.642]  A speech crime.
[01:34:47.463 --> 01:34:49.124]  But let's not just believe the Gateway Pundit.
[01:34:51.425 --> 01:34:52.485]  And I appreciate him covering it.
[01:34:52.585 --> 01:34:53.186]  It's much worse.
[01:34:53.226 --> 01:34:56.848]  Here is the sentencing recommendation two days ago filed.
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:02.201]  And they say the Democrats are communists.
[01:35:03.181 --> 01:35:05.282]  Shroyer did not step foot inside the Capitol.
[01:35:06.062 --> 01:35:06.942]  He didn't need to.
[01:35:07.402 --> 01:35:09.263]  Shroyer helped create January 6th.
[01:35:09.763 --> 01:35:10.483]  Showing you the document.
[01:35:14.464 --> 01:35:33.814]   And it goes on here, in the charging document, to say, he continued, and they give the video mark, From the show, he continued, we will not accept the fake election of the child molester Joe Biden.
[01:35:34.275 --> 01:35:36.296]  The Chinese communist agent Joe Biden.
[01:35:36.316 --> 01:35:37.037]  All that's true, by the way.
[01:35:38.098 --> 01:35:39.939]  We know where he belongs.
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:41.620]  And it's not in the White House.
[01:35:42.261 --> 01:35:45.984]  Then they go, he's not repentant.
[01:35:47.165 --> 01:35:50.467]  He then again on the show in August said this.
[01:35:53.890 --> 01:35:55.511]  So again, they're in the document.
[01:35:58.337 --> 01:36:01.298]  Saying that he is not repentant.
[01:36:05.099 --> 01:36:11.141]  They go on to say he does not reverse his narrative on January 6th, but he says it was staged by the feds.
[01:36:15.983 --> 01:36:16.483]  He goes on.
[01:36:19.554 --> 01:36:25.939]  Notably, for the misdemeanor defendant like Troyer, the absence of violence or destructive acts is not a mitigating factor.
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:29.542]  Had Troyer engaged in such conduct, he would have faced additional criminal charges.
[01:36:29.863 --> 01:36:36.328]  Troyer cannot light a fire near a can of gasoline and then express concern or disbelief when it explodes.
[01:36:36.348 --> 01:36:39.811]  So, you go to a protest and something bad happens, it's your fault.
[01:36:42.873 --> 01:36:45.596]  They're going to say we want to impose a larger sentence.
[01:36:46.889 --> 01:36:53.713]  Because again, he is not repentant for what he has said or what he has done.
[01:36:53.533 --> 01:37:03.292]   and he said on August 27th that he still believes that the election was stolen.
[01:37:03.292 --> 01:37:10.412]  That's America, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:10.483 --> 01:37:11.303]  That's our country.
[01:37:12.244 --> 01:37:13.665]  And that's him facing sentencing.
[01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:15.670]  Next week.
[01:37:16.371 --> 01:37:18.953]  Owen Troyer is not repentant.
[01:37:19.534 --> 01:37:26.340]  He's still saying they stole the election, and he said again on August 27th, Biden's a pedophile.
[01:37:26.601 --> 01:37:28.382]  Well, if he's wrong, that's his free speech.
[01:37:28.823 --> 01:37:29.383]  Or suing.
[01:37:29.884 --> 01:37:30.064]  No.
[01:37:30.845 --> 01:37:31.325]  They don't care.
[01:37:31.345 --> 01:37:36.490]  All right, we have a special guest coming up, and I noticed that he's got another fellow with him, so we'll find out who that is.
[01:37:37.271 --> 01:37:39.152]  And we really appreciate him joining us.
[01:37:40.404 --> 01:37:46.708]  And we'll be breaking it all down when we return next segment in just two minutes from now.
[01:37:48.088 --> 01:37:54.232]  We will also watch Owen today at 3 p.m.
[01:37:54.352 --> 01:37:56.553]  Central with The War Room.
[01:37:56.573 --> 01:38:09.581]  But it really hit me this morning that Owen, no criminal record, a great guy, is facing jail and may not even be here next week if they decide to throw him in prison.
[01:38:11.773 --> 01:38:14.634]  And the Feds have been like, well, don't complain too much.
[01:38:14.854 --> 01:38:15.654]  It may be longer.
[01:38:16.654 --> 01:38:17.454]  They could do a year.
[01:38:18.414 --> 01:38:21.255]  But again, that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:22.195 --> 01:38:23.175]  And that's how this works.
[01:38:23.996 --> 01:38:25.776]  But you can fight back against this tyranny.
[01:38:25.796 --> 01:38:27.396]  You can share the word about the broadcast.
[01:38:27.676 --> 01:38:28.777]  You can share the clip and audio.
[01:38:29.057 --> 01:38:30.137]  And you can pray for Owen.
[01:38:30.177 --> 01:38:34.618]  And you can buy products at m4store.com, DNA Force Plus, finally back at stock, discounted.
[01:38:34.898 --> 01:38:35.778]  Body's back in stock.
[01:38:36.358 --> 01:38:38.199]  The great products you need, and it keeps us on air.
[01:38:38.559 --> 01:38:39.439]  Take action now.
[01:38:40.561 --> 01:38:43.263]  It's Friday, September 8, 2023.
[01:38:44.764 --> 01:38:48.025]  And we're not talking about conspiracy theories here today.
[01:38:48.986 --> 01:38:51.428]  We're not talking about theoretical things.
[01:38:51.448 --> 01:38:59.192]  We're not talking about things that are fiction or postulating possible futures.
[01:38:59.232 --> 01:39:07.177]  We're talking about what is known to be deployed that is being rolled out right now against humanity.
[01:39:08.556 --> 01:39:22.460]  One of my greatest frustrations, I've been on there 29 years, is I'd read Pentagon documents that were public 25, 26 years ago about spider goats that are part spider that create body armor through their milk for the Pentagon for a giant project.
[01:39:23.101 --> 01:39:24.221]  And China has it as well.
[01:39:25.241 --> 01:39:30.403]  And callers would call in and say, there's no way we have goats spliced with spiders, that's just made up.
[01:39:32.223 --> 01:39:40.164]   It's this week they came out and said, yeah, we've created humanoids in the laboratory that don't have any There's no sperm or eggs involved or any parents.
[01:39:41.665 --> 01:39:42.705]  But we're not going to upset you.
[01:39:42.725 --> 01:39:42.985]  It's discreet.
[01:39:43.025 --> 01:39:46.825]  We're not going to show them to you.
[01:39:46.845 --> 01:39:50.066]  So, Steve, we don't have little great men from Mars landing, little green men.
[01:39:50.086 --> 01:39:55.927]  We don't have foreign aliens proven here, but we have alien life forms being created on Earth.
[01:39:56.007 --> 01:39:56.887]  So, here we are.
[01:39:58.927 --> 01:40:06.927]   On a special Friday transmission, the Alex Jones Show 2.0, exclusively at Stephen Crowder and the Mug Club.
[01:40:06.927 --> 01:40:24.927]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say,
[01:40:24.927 --> 01:40:27.927]   "I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you wanna fight?"
[01:40:28.558 --> 01:40:30.739]  You better believe you've got one!
[01:40:32.659 --> 01:40:39.659]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:40:39.659 --> 01:40:55.659]  [Music]
[01:40:55.659 --> 01:40:59.659]   All right, for the balance of the hour, we're going to skip some of the breaks so we have more time.
[01:40:59.696 --> 01:41:12.165]  Steve Sleptovic is our guest, and his bio would take an hour to go over, but he is an emergency manager and has been involved in a lot of different emergencies around the world.
[01:41:12.605 --> 01:41:15.828]  He also has a firefighter friend of his that's been involved.
[01:41:15.848 --> 01:41:16.588]  They live in Hawaii.
[01:41:17.409 --> 01:41:18.890]  SteveSleptovic.com.
[01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:21.852]  S-L-E-P-C-E-V-I-C.com.
[01:41:22.672 --> 01:41:24.294]  And he has his associate with him.
[01:41:25.114 --> 01:41:25.755]  Sam Eaton.
[01:41:26.596 --> 01:41:44.758]   So I think it's best we start off here with you guys introducing yourselves and then I wanted to get you on because I saw your reports and things a few weeks ago but you were too busy with the helicopters and the aid and getting around the exclusion zone there in Lahaina, Maui and the rest of it but That story's already moved off.
[01:41:44.778 --> 01:41:45.559]  We moved on to other things.
[01:41:45.679 --> 01:41:49.241]  I don't want to move off from that because it's really illustrated with the tyranny.
[01:41:49.261 --> 01:41:53.804]  Plus, those are fellow Americans and Hawaiians that don't deserve what's happened to them.
[01:41:54.165 --> 01:41:55.526]  So introduce yourself.
[01:41:55.566 --> 01:41:56.426]  Tell us who you are.
[01:41:57.027 --> 01:42:11.317]  And then you'll have the floor here to give us your prognosis and your analysis of what's really happened with the blocking the people in and turning the water off and not triggering the emergency alarms and the high winds and leaving the power on.
[01:42:12.591 --> 01:42:20.038]  And then now the mayor and the emergency manager saying don't look at social media, don't research, just shut up.
[01:42:20.959 --> 01:42:22.661]  And they're trying to keep the media out.
[01:42:22.721 --> 01:42:24.763]  Even people miles away, they come up and harass them.
[01:42:26.244 --> 01:42:27.526]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:42:28.086 --> 01:42:32.450]  And so why don't you, Steve, introduce this.
[01:42:33.011 --> 01:42:37.155]  Tell us who you are and tell us who your firefighter associate is and then break down what happened.
[01:42:38.283 --> 01:42:41.165]  Okay, so I've been at this business since 1989.
[01:42:41.425 --> 01:42:46.008]  The first storm I ever worked, first disaster I ever deployed to was Hurricane Andrew.
[01:42:46.028 --> 01:42:47.369]  That was many, many years ago.
[01:42:47.389 --> 01:42:50.792]  Then after that, it was the earthquake in 94, Northridge.
[01:42:50.812 --> 01:42:55.074]  It was a civil unrest, what you want to call the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.
[01:42:55.114 --> 01:43:03.040]   So wherever a wide area disaster is happening, be it natural or unnatural, We're typically right there what we call on day one.
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:15.728]  In some cases, like the many hurricane deployments we have, we're there three, four days ahead of time working for the critical infrastructure facilities like the hospitals, the airports, the shipping ports, all that type of stuff.
[01:43:15.789 --> 01:43:22.333]  Really bringing in the fuel, the power, additional paramedics, additional security teams, because everyone's leaving the area.
[01:43:24.221 --> 01:43:27.563]  Yeah, so I mean, this has been our life's work.
[01:43:28.523 --> 01:43:30.004]  My associate here is Sam Eaton.
[01:43:30.064 --> 01:43:34.006]  He's a former battalion chief, 30 plus years in the fire service.
[01:43:34.886 --> 01:43:36.627]  Sam, I'll let you share a little bit about your background.
[01:43:37.108 --> 01:43:41.890]  I'm 30 years with the South Florida Fire Department, here now with the SRP the last three years.
[01:43:44.318 --> 01:43:51.826]  My background is, I've obviously worked as a battalion chief for 12 years, in the last part of my career.
[01:43:52.487 --> 01:43:57.793]  And I was involved in the Emergency Operations Center, Battalion Command for disasters.
[01:43:58.513 --> 01:44:03.699]  And actually, just as Steve, my first storm was actually Hurricane Andrew.
[01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:05.861]  So it goes all the way back to that point.
[01:44:07.253 --> 01:44:13.657]  To be with this organization, this company, to deploy and still be in service in retirement here is an honor.
[01:44:14.337 --> 01:44:15.238]  That's incredibly important.
[01:44:15.278 --> 01:44:21.502]  Describe what your company does because I saw you on the show, the amazing things you do and you've been all over this.
[01:44:21.942 --> 01:44:28.326]  So tell people about what your company does and let's get into what you've done in Maui and give us your expert analysis on what's happening.
[01:44:29.025 --> 01:44:34.169]  Yeah, so we do, because we do planning, the planning that we do is a very high level, right?
[01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:35.931]  In this business, I'm a solutions guy.
[01:44:35.991 --> 01:44:39.373]  So with a little bit of an engineering background was where I started.
[01:44:39.994 --> 01:44:43.937]  Every time I'd see these plans fail, my job was to go in there and find a better solution.
[01:44:43.997 --> 01:44:52.004]  So in the process of creating these plans, I put a, embedded a highly trained critical response team to be a part of that plan.
[01:44:52.728 --> 01:44:59.810]  So typically, when we get into these wide area disasters, the first thing that we do is we show up at the EOC, the Emergency Operations Center.
[01:45:00.190 --> 01:45:01.271]  We announce ourselves.
[01:45:01.711 --> 01:45:03.131]  We say, here's our capabilities.
[01:45:03.211 --> 01:45:10.333]  We have the abilities to bring in X amount of security teams, power up the entire municipality, the hospital, the ports, whatever is needed.
[01:45:10.773 --> 01:45:13.014]  We can help with cleanup, the remediation.
[01:45:13.034 --> 01:45:16.935]  So it's very similar to a military, very similar to a military operation.
[01:45:17.415 --> 01:45:18.435]  Very much so, yeah.
[01:45:18.496 --> 01:45:19.996]  And we're a private contractor, so we move.
[01:45:20.854 --> 01:45:24.236]  Much faster without any government red tape, right?
[01:45:24.356 --> 01:45:25.356]  And so it's real simple.
[01:45:25.737 --> 01:45:31.079]  And in all my experience of doing this 33 plus years, we're welcomed in, right?
[01:45:31.119 --> 01:45:32.720]  We show up, they're like, oh, you have this?
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:33.620]  Okay, can you do that?
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:34.261]  Can you handle this?
[01:45:34.681 --> 01:45:39.263]  You know, everything from satellite phones to setting up comms to setting up everything that needs to be done.
[01:45:39.323 --> 01:45:41.404]  Sanitation, base camps.
[01:45:41.444 --> 01:45:45.687]  I've been reading your site, and I'm gonna give you the floor, but that's what I'm getting from you and what the locals say.
[01:45:46.787 --> 01:45:51.390]  Their default, not following standard procedure to even render aid or take help.
[01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:55.973]  I mean, so what you're saying is, I know you're about to go there, is that you've never seen it before where you're blocked.
[01:45:56.713 --> 01:45:56.913]  Yeah.
[01:45:57.414 --> 01:45:58.975]  I mean, it was a straight arm approach.
[01:45:59.015 --> 01:46:00.316]  They're like, we have this handled.
[01:46:00.376 --> 01:46:04.078]  I'm like, well, looking around you based on results, you don't.
[01:46:04.907 --> 01:46:10.853]  You know, we obviously responded to multiple incidents across the country and different deployments and stuff.
[01:46:10.873 --> 01:46:17.079]  When I, when we came into Maui, there was, it was like a ghost town from a standpoint of support.
[01:46:18.054 --> 01:46:24.700]  You're seeing locals having to dig down and do things that normally the government would be there actually providing.
[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:30.906]  They were bringing in food and supplies from the water side because they couldn't get in through the roadways because they were blocked off by the government.
[01:46:30.926 --> 01:46:41.475]  So my heart goes out to the Maui people as they lost all of this and in the midst of all that they did not get the support at least for the first couple of weeks that they needed.
[01:46:43.049 --> 01:46:44.990]  Well, let's go back and start, because I interrupted.
[01:46:45.010 --> 01:46:49.852]  Because I'm not an emergency manager like you, but I follow disasters.
[01:46:49.912 --> 01:46:50.272]  I cover it.
[01:46:50.612 --> 01:46:53.453]  Normally, all the help, accredited groups, they bring you in.
[01:46:53.893 --> 01:46:54.713]  That is so critical.
[01:46:54.733 --> 01:46:55.794]  That's what the locals all said.
[01:46:55.814 --> 01:47:00.116]  Day one, people even from their own town couldn't bring in groceries.
[01:47:00.536 --> 01:47:02.837]  So there was a day one cover-up what's happening.
[01:47:02.857 --> 01:47:04.117]  I mean, you can see the cover-up.
[01:47:05.177 --> 01:47:08.639]  Yeah, the cover-up was going in the government sector of it.
[01:47:08.679 --> 01:47:11.720]  But what was interesting was they set no perimeter on it.
[01:47:12.384 --> 01:47:17.288]  So one of the people that I know is a chef in town, he didn't even know about the fire.
[01:47:17.348 --> 01:47:19.069]  He was driving from out of town where he lives.
[01:47:19.530 --> 01:47:22.572]  As he drove into town, there was no security, there was no perimeter.
[01:47:23.012 --> 01:47:29.257]  He's driving by burnt vehicles with bodies slumped over the steering wheel, like a vehicle of four people burned.
[01:47:29.297 --> 01:47:35.422]  We're talking about twilight zone, no one even... So they had a lockdown during the fire, but not at first right after?
[01:47:36.072 --> 01:47:36.412]  Correct.
[01:47:37.133 --> 01:47:47.582]  And there was another one of our friends who's a security guard who was trying to go by the traffic where they had blocked, the cops had blocked off for one area where they said that the power lines were down.
[01:47:47.622 --> 01:47:56.370]  But it was interesting because people were coming off the hill and then they were pushing everybody from both other exits into the center, causing a massive pileup.
[01:47:57.108 --> 01:48:06.500]  And the cop that was standing in the blocking the road was blocking it on the other side of the power line, saying that he's there to protect it from the power line, yet the power's out.
[01:48:07.541 --> 01:48:20.276]   So, the thing about, well people are not, the people, the local people don't like to get on camera, because in a small community, The cop has a kid, which your kid goes to school with, right?
[01:48:20.717 --> 01:48:24.803]  And in that area, these generational families, they keep really to themselves.
[01:48:24.823 --> 01:48:26.967]  I mean, as a matter of fact... Oh, I've talked to them privately.
[01:48:26.987 --> 01:48:27.888]  They say it's a setup.
[01:48:27.949 --> 01:48:29.151]  They were... but they're scared.
[01:48:30.714 --> 01:48:30.934]  Yeah.
[01:48:31.394 --> 01:48:35.096]  I mean, we sat down last night and it's a very private community.
[01:48:35.156 --> 01:48:41.278]  We work very closely with the Native Hawaiians and we've done that because I've been coming to this island since I've been 19 years old.
[01:48:41.298 --> 01:48:49.180]  The first set of plans I did when I was 19 going to school for architecture and engineering was in Kona for a two-car garage in Lanai.
[01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:53.182]  And I've been surfing out here, got to know the big wave community very well since I was 19.
[01:48:53.242 --> 01:48:56.623]  So you know the community, you're in love with it, and now you see it being raped.
[01:48:57.323 --> 01:48:57.503]  Yeah.
[01:49:00.831 --> 01:49:10.420]  There's a lot of concerns, and there are a group of Native Hawaiians that are really taking to this, because from day one, when we got out here, I had a private meeting with them.
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:12.061]  We all sat down as a collective.
[01:49:12.522 --> 01:49:15.224]  Sam was there, Jeffrey was there, a whole group of us got together.
[01:49:15.644 --> 01:49:21.089]  And what I explained to them, I said, you guys got to lock arms like you never have done before.
[01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:32.370]   The only way to keep this group from moving in And then simply you giving up your property because what people don't understand is the insurance company is going to slow pay, right?
[01:49:32.691 --> 01:49:34.572]  Your loss of use is going to run out in one year.
[01:49:35.232 --> 01:49:38.675]  All the houses that are being rebuilt are going to have to be rebuilt with the new fire codes.
[01:49:39.035 --> 01:49:45.019]  There's going to be new easements, which these houses were plantation homes where people used to walk from their homes to the sugarcane fields, right?
[01:49:45.619 --> 01:49:49.644]  If FEMA implements their flood zones, you're going to have to raise a lot of those properties along the coast.
[01:49:50.144 --> 01:49:50.525]  Exactly.
[01:49:50.545 --> 01:49:51.866]  It's meant to drive the poor people out.
[01:49:51.906 --> 01:49:53.308]  So let's pull back $35,000 for the UN.
[01:49:53.328 --> 01:49:54.229]  Let's start over.
[01:49:54.249 --> 01:49:54.949]  Amazing interview.
[01:49:54.970 --> 01:49:56.631]  I know you're busy, but you're on time.
[01:49:57.032 --> 01:49:57.993]  How long have you been there?
[01:49:58.133 --> 01:49:59.074]  What are you witnessing?
[01:50:00.856 --> 01:50:06.102]  Let's look at the disaster first, and as an emergency manager, what do you see happening that's so different from other events?
[01:50:07.093 --> 01:50:08.253]  Let's talk about the disaster.
[01:50:09.894 --> 01:50:11.694]  We're not allowed to go to all the areas.
[01:50:11.754 --> 01:50:13.255]  Obviously, there's a lot of access issues.
[01:50:13.315 --> 01:50:15.696]  And those access issues are for good reason.
[01:50:15.876 --> 01:50:17.276]  This is a toxic mess.
[01:50:17.296 --> 01:50:18.436]  This is not a wildland fire.
[01:50:18.897 --> 01:50:21.237]  This is a commercial, it's a gigantic commercial structure fire.
[01:50:21.737 --> 01:50:25.279]  It's houses, it's cars, it's residential structures.
[01:50:25.799 --> 01:50:33.401]  And it was wind fueled by that hurricane that was passing past the island, generating 70, 80 mile an hour winds, sustained winds.
[01:50:33.971 --> 01:50:35.973]  During the worst time it could happen.
[01:50:36.394 --> 01:50:48.987]  Once those first couple of structures, we were talking last night, a bunch of firefighters from the federal side, as well as here in Maui, and once this fire started on the top leading edge of this fire, there's not a fire department on this earth that could have put that fire out.
[01:50:49.368 --> 01:50:55.915]  There's obviously the water supply issues, and I've heard about that, and obviously there's some kind of a system here where they've got to... Oh, they admit they denied the water that day.
[01:50:57.222 --> 01:51:01.265]  They have to ask permission to utilize the water, which boggles my mind.
[01:51:01.285 --> 01:51:08.370]  Let's be clear, fire happening, and it's denied, where everywhere else there's fire hydrants, the fire department's in control of water and emergencies.
[01:51:09.591 --> 01:51:10.552]  That's the way it should be.
[01:51:10.712 --> 01:51:15.555]  And I don't know what happened, but I'll tell you what, there's a lot of missteps here, before, during, and after this fire.
[01:51:15.775 --> 01:51:17.597]  And clearly this was a tender box.
[01:51:17.977 --> 01:51:20.959]  You've got drought-like conditions for the last several years.
[01:51:21.279 --> 01:51:22.300]  I was here 10 years ago.
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:24.262]  This was a lush area, Lahaina.
[01:51:24.382 --> 01:51:28.430]   I remember, and I came in, And it's just brown.
[01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:40.900]  It's dried out because the water's being taken by, as I understand it, by corporations and stuff to fuel, to help their industries and keep the water in the areas like for cattle and for pineapple and whatever it happens to be.
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:42.901]  And these areas are really dry right now.
[01:51:42.921 --> 01:51:47.445]  Throw that on top of a weak infrastructure as far as electrical system is concerned.
[01:51:47.785 --> 01:51:49.467]  You've got winds blowing power lines down.
[01:51:49.507 --> 01:51:50.708]  You've got no access to water.
[01:51:51.048 --> 01:51:52.749]  You have limited access already.
[01:51:52.789 --> 01:51:54.791]  It's set up for a conflagration.
[01:51:55.807 --> 01:51:58.009]  The emergency operations crews can't get in there.
[01:51:58.349 --> 01:52:05.974]  So once this fire started, it's virtually impossible to make a stand on them because the wind is, it was like a blowtorch blowing through Lahaina.
[01:52:06.074 --> 01:52:07.915]  It is, it was a horrible disaster.
[01:52:08.295 --> 01:52:09.516]  Here's something else to think about.
[01:52:09.536 --> 01:52:12.478]  The last number I heard was 1100 missing.
[01:52:13.359 --> 01:52:14.840]  That's not counting undocumented.
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:16.060]  That's not counting homeless.
[01:52:17.101 --> 01:52:22.865]  And just in the front page of the Honolulu's newspaper today, they're still missing 500 children and they don't know.
[01:52:24.157 --> 01:52:33.386]  There's there's people were wiped off the face of the earth and there's not a damn peep of word out of media Nobody understands this but this is a huge.
[01:52:33.426 --> 01:52:44.916]  This is on a level of 9-11 Life of loss you're talking about school probably close to 2,000 people Dead gone and perished and there's nobody talking about it.
[01:52:45.016 --> 01:53:19.091]   Thank you for keeping it relevant Alex Wow, so so You've been all over the country, you've seen this everywhere, you've been doing it for decades together, I guess collectively 60 years, the two of you, and what you're saying is what we see in the hearings, what we see in the city council meetings, the blocking off the roads, the BlackRock that owned the power company not trimming the trees, all of that, I know it's speculation, but just pulling back, what do the locals think happened, and what do you think really went down?
[01:53:22.619 --> 01:53:34.470]  If you wanted a perfect storm scenario, that you wanted to rebuild a city to bring it into a new, green, modern, you know, 15-minute type scenario, this is how you do it.
[01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:36.069]  You just burn it down.
[01:53:36.130 --> 01:53:43.613]  When you have the Chinook winds blowing off that thing, they can't find, there's so much misinformation as to how the fire started.
[01:53:44.113 --> 01:53:51.997]  At the end of the day, anybody could have gone up there, lit a match, or started the fire, and that pattern was going to take Lahaina out.
[01:53:52.377 --> 01:53:57.779]  When you push 60-something firefighters into Kula, right, which is what they did, they had, I think, 13 engines.
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:01.521]  There wasn't a firefighter down on Front Street.
[01:54:02.279 --> 01:54:10.567]  So if you're going to remodel and rebuild the city, you cannot do it with all the historic things that are grandfathered in.
[01:54:10.888 --> 01:54:12.890]  The only way to do it is to level the city.
[01:54:13.450 --> 01:54:20.778]  Now you have a clean palette that the government's going to pay to demo, clear all the stuff out and basically rezone the area.
[01:54:20.798 --> 01:54:23.260]  People are just going to lose their land.
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:29.069]   So if you want to take the most prime real estate, Uh, this is how you do it.
[01:54:29.269 --> 01:54:34.931]  Well, that's what locals say is it was a choreographed destruction because you look at every step to mess up.
[01:54:35.071 --> 01:54:47.936]  I get there's incompetence, but to mess up so many times so perfectly is, is, and then, then to cover it up and, and then to not render aid, because I guess if there's whole families dead, they won't be able to stand up.
[01:54:48.256 --> 01:54:49.537]  Their property will be taken.
[01:54:50.878 --> 01:54:53.919]  It's hard to, it's hard to put your finger on either side of that coin.
[01:54:54.119 --> 01:54:56.640]  And, and, and honestly, you can't, you can't discount either side of it.
[01:54:57.524 --> 01:55:09.235]  It looks like to me there's enough there that shows a horrific, orchestrated, not orchestrated, non-orchestrated missteps over and over again that led to this disaster.
[01:55:09.275 --> 01:55:17.002]  But there's a lot, there's still questions in my mind about some of the things that actually went down and it's hard to put your finger on directly.
[01:55:17.022 --> 01:55:17.342]  No, no, exactly.
[01:55:17.743 --> 01:55:19.845]  Either way they're covering it up so we don't know.
[01:55:23.223 --> 01:55:26.164]  Well, make your points because I got a thousand questions, but you're there.
[01:55:26.184 --> 01:55:29.004]  What are the key points people you know?
[01:55:29.104 --> 01:55:32.685]  I think one of the things we're expressing as a company is safety.
[01:55:33.145 --> 01:55:36.486]  This is a, and Steve will tell you this, we've worked since we got here.
[01:55:36.906 --> 01:55:41.907]  My background, I'm actually a director for a cancer prevention team in Florida.
[01:55:42.447 --> 01:55:45.888]  And as soon as I got here, this is a post-fire scenario.
[01:55:47.864 --> 01:55:54.147]  The particulate that's in the area, just in the air alone, anytime trucks are driving by, this stuff is being rolled up.
[01:55:54.167 --> 01:55:55.347]  And we're talking about arsenic.
[01:55:55.367 --> 01:55:58.148]  We're talking about heavy metals, asbestos.
[01:55:58.168 --> 01:56:04.191]  We're talking about, you know, petroleum products, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, benzenes.
[01:56:04.751 --> 01:56:06.051]  You can name the list.
[01:56:06.111 --> 01:56:11.253]  Look at any typical structure fire and any just a regular home fire, and you're going to find those things.
[01:56:11.293 --> 01:56:12.754]  Now you're talking on a mass scale.
[01:56:13.154 --> 01:56:16.475]  So there's an area right now that people shouldn't be going into.
[01:56:16.536 --> 01:56:19.358]   So when the government says, We don't want you down there.
[01:56:19.538 --> 01:56:22.140]  There is a health, a heavy health risk.
[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:30.845]  If you look at the number of people that have been injured and affected by 9-11 since... Yeah, so this is East Palestine, basically.
[01:56:31.385 --> 01:56:41.912]  Yeah, this is one of those things right now that you're talking about years that this is going to impact the environment, not just ecologically, but the health concerns for the public.
[01:56:42.232 --> 01:56:44.914]  So we initially put out a safety briefing right off the bat.
[01:56:45.294 --> 01:56:51.399]  You need to protect yourself, make sure you're on respiratory protection, that you're covered completely, that when you go down there, don't bring your kids down there.
[01:56:51.419 --> 01:56:54.281]  If you're allowed to go to your property, this is not a place to play around.
[01:56:54.641 --> 01:56:58.024]  If you get in there, make sure you get what you need and then get out.
[01:56:58.164 --> 01:57:03.708]  Make sure you clean yourself up and disrobe or just get rid of your clothing because this stuff is just highly toxic.
[01:57:03.748 --> 01:57:12.215]  So that's one of the things that we've been working on with the public and obviously helping them understand that because firefighters have an understanding of it.
[01:57:12.731 --> 01:57:21.057]  We certainly do as emergency management, but the general population, the workers, the volunteers, the people that are coming in as contractors, they just have no clue.
[01:57:21.277 --> 01:57:22.178]  Nobody's wearing anything.
[01:57:22.318 --> 01:57:23.819]  But let's be clear.
[01:57:23.919 --> 01:57:24.620]  Hold on, Steve.
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:25.180]  I'll go to you.
[01:57:27.322 --> 01:57:29.524]  You've been to a bunch of emergencies, probably hundreds.
[01:57:29.724 --> 01:57:32.886]  You've never seen, you said earlier, the cover-up here.
[01:57:33.086 --> 01:57:36.088]  So what is the current state of the cover-up, to get to your point?
[01:57:38.170 --> 01:57:38.630]  You know, to me...
[01:57:40.111 --> 01:57:51.461]  When you see the President Biden walking down the center of Front Street with no personal protective equipment on, no respirators, no nothing, just walking down the middle with all his representatives.
[01:57:51.501 --> 01:58:02.371]  Meanwhile, everybody along the other sides of either side of the roads, all the USAR teams are all fitted out, right, with their PPEs to make sure that they're not absorbing this stuff through their skin, through the air, through whatever else.
[01:58:02.907 --> 01:58:04.307]  That's sending the wrong message.
[01:58:05.528 --> 01:58:12.309]  The other part of it is some of the homes that we've tested in the area for the Native Hawaiians, we've done that as a courtesy, just pro bono.
[01:58:12.769 --> 01:58:24.131]  Let's get a CIH certified dust hygienist, let's pull some samples from inside your living quarters, your attic, from your bedroom, from the seat can lights, from your mattress, from the kids' toys.
[01:58:24.731 --> 01:58:30.753]  All the stuff is hitting way hot with carcinogens, highly toxic stuff that is getting blown into people's homes.
[01:58:30.793 --> 01:58:32.413]  So this is like 9-11 where they covered up the dust?
[01:58:34.107 --> 01:58:34.667]  100%.
[01:58:34.287 --> 01:58:34.667]  Terrible.
[01:58:35.048 --> 01:58:36.208]  It is 100% that.
[01:58:36.408 --> 01:58:37.969]  And that's not inflating it.
[01:58:38.109 --> 01:58:40.749]  The test results show what it is.
[01:58:42.770 --> 01:58:45.951]  You know, so it's going to have a long-term health impact on it.
[01:58:46.351 --> 01:58:50.433]  Once the rains kick up, this stuff starts washing into the ocean, all the heavy metals going into the fish.
[01:58:50.813 --> 01:58:52.994]  This is another environmental disaster.
[01:58:53.014 --> 01:58:54.014]  They're not setting up booms.
[01:58:54.034 --> 01:58:56.175]  They're not doing anything on that aspect of it.
[01:58:57.875 --> 01:58:58.575]  Well, yeah.
[01:58:58.615 --> 01:59:00.136]  I mean, Biden said he did a great job.
[01:59:00.176 --> 01:59:01.236]  He won't go to East Palestine.
[01:59:03.638 --> 01:59:06.681]  Clearly, total incompetence or premeditated.
[01:59:08.542 --> 01:59:10.104]  This has really gotten the public's attention.
[01:59:10.164 --> 01:59:10.804]  That's a good thing.
[01:59:13.347 --> 01:59:14.608]  So let me add one thing to it.
[01:59:14.648 --> 01:59:18.511]  So with Archie Kaleppa, if you know who he is, he's the Waterman, right?
[01:59:19.332 --> 01:59:23.716]  The lifeguard that in Hurricane Iniki rescued 11 people during the hurricane.
[01:59:24.256 --> 01:59:28.220]  He's the one that invented the ski with the sled and the rescue ski.
[01:59:28.260 --> 01:59:30.622]  He's the one who also invented the tow and surfing.
[01:59:31.497 --> 01:59:33.879]  Archie Kaleppa is the guy leading the Native Hawaiians.
[01:59:33.899 --> 01:59:40.104]  He's been on multiple meetings with Tolson Gabbert, a close personal friend of mine.
[01:59:40.144 --> 01:59:41.925]  As a matter of fact, we're doing a paddle out today.
[01:59:42.365 --> 01:59:51.092]  It's one month today since the fire happened, so the team is taking a break at noon Hawaii time, and the whole crew is paddling out.
[01:59:51.673 --> 01:59:54.415]  They're doing a helicopter flower drop.
[01:59:55.716 --> 01:59:57.017]  You know, everybody's locking arms.
[01:59:57.057 --> 01:59:58.578]  The boat line is going to be showing up.
[01:59:58.598 --> 02:00:05.015]   It's there just to To express a pair of respects that we lost, you know?
[02:00:05.436 --> 02:00:12.861]  But on January 20th, the goal here is what I'm empowering these Hawaiian people to do is to lock arms, right?
[02:00:13.301 --> 02:00:25.389]  So the group put together for January 20th, they're looking to bring 40,000 people to Maui to lock arms around the entire fire line, all the way up into the hills and all the way down to the coastline.
[02:00:27.591 --> 02:00:30.112]  When you keep putting pressure... Alright, Steve, stay there, stay there.
[02:00:30.732 --> 02:00:31.373]  This is important.
[02:00:31.893 --> 02:00:37.415]  Mobilizing the locals to not be taken over by Oprah and Bill Gates and The Rock and all of them that want the land.
[02:00:37.995 --> 02:00:41.317]  You're there to mobilize them for their rights and to make sure this doesn't happen again.
[02:00:41.337 --> 02:00:45.098]  Because, folks, they did this in California, not cutting the trees back in the last few years.
[02:00:45.118 --> 02:00:46.019]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:00:46.039 --> 02:00:53.281]  They're doing it again here and it's neglect on purpose, bare minimum.
[02:00:53.602 --> 02:00:54.062]  We'll be right back.
[02:00:55.225 --> 02:01:00.850]  Slepcivic, emergency manager and firefighter Sam Eaton are our guests.
[02:01:01.230 --> 02:01:13.700]  Guys, I asked a lot of questions in that last long segment, but just pulling back, the way they're covering it up, the way they're blocking aid, the way the mayor and the police chief say, don't look at social media, don't ask questions.
[02:01:14.861 --> 02:01:19.444]  I'm not an emergency manager like you, but I've been on air 29 years, I cover disasters, I cover this, I know this.
[02:01:19.965 --> 02:01:22.327]  Usually it's like, bring any aid you've got of your certified group.
[02:01:23.027 --> 02:01:25.008]  What have they done trying to block you coming in?
[02:01:25.028 --> 02:01:33.854]  Because I know up until even a few days ago, at least we're a month into this now, people are having to show up in jet skis, sailboats, motorboats to bring aid in.
[02:01:33.874 --> 02:01:41.139]  And then we've had reporters that live there, you know, real estate agents and stuff, they're like, they're videotaping burnt cars.
[02:01:42.099 --> 02:01:43.760]  And the police show up and say, you can't do that.
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:44.841]  That's not America.
[02:01:45.301 --> 02:01:46.742]  What do you really think's going on?
[02:01:46.962 --> 02:01:52.206]  And then just get into all the other general points you want to make, because I'm going to ask the questions, but I want you to direct where we go now.
[02:01:54.091 --> 02:01:59.476]  Um, as I pointed out earlier, I think you look at some of this stuff.
[02:01:59.716 --> 02:02:08.324]  Um, you know, the, it was a perfect, horrific storm of issues that led to this, this, this tragedy.
[02:02:08.724 --> 02:02:09.505]  That's what it looks like.
[02:02:09.525 --> 02:02:13.789]  Uh, most of my, most of the intel after the last being here almost a month.
[02:02:14.049 --> 02:02:15.490]  And by the way, today is one month.
[02:02:15.530 --> 02:02:20.234]  I didn't know if you knew that or not, but I didn't know if you're, you just said that one month ago today was the fires.
[02:02:20.475 --> 02:02:24.238]   And, um, That first couple of weeks was insane.
[02:02:24.518 --> 02:02:30.942]  And to watch these, we were talking to locals, you know, just basically saying, Hey, listen, what, what do you, what are you seeing out there?
[02:02:31.382 --> 02:02:32.623]  And they would break down crying.
[02:02:33.284 --> 02:02:36.486]  Like they would literally just in front of us, just start sobbing.
[02:02:37.386 --> 02:02:41.329]  And this happened several times where the emotions would just pour out.
[02:02:41.489 --> 02:02:45.051]  And the urgency for them was where's the help?
[02:02:45.792 --> 02:02:49.314]  You know, where, where's the P where we, we're, we're citizens.
[02:02:49.334 --> 02:02:50.115]  We're Americans.
[02:02:50.175 --> 02:02:51.422]   We're, We've been here.
[02:02:51.482 --> 02:02:52.663]  We were loyal.
[02:02:53.243 --> 02:02:54.424]  Where's the loyalty to us?
[02:02:54.764 --> 02:03:04.030]  And to watch these people just scrape and grind to try to get support down to their local brothers and sisters and families.
[02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:06.491]  It was terrible.
[02:03:06.551 --> 02:03:10.073]  So from that standpoint, again, these are all head scratchers for us.
[02:03:10.714 --> 02:03:14.456]  To watch that kind of just disconnect with the people.
[02:03:14.876 --> 02:03:18.558]  There was one point where they were sending teams in.
[02:03:18.598 --> 02:03:20.079]  I remember this vividly.
[02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:23.911]  And there's a, there's a group, Steve mentioned Archie Kalepa.
[02:03:24.372 --> 02:03:28.635]  He has a, has a team of, of, of, of generational individuals that are around him.
[02:03:29.055 --> 02:03:30.977]  And there's an area called Hawaiian Homes.
[02:03:31.637 --> 02:03:42.485]  And the, the, the government with all this mistrust already going on and two weeks into this, the government sent down FEMA groups to go into their home area.
[02:03:43.376 --> 02:03:54.940]  And they're all masked up, they're all geared up, they've got, some of them are rightfully so, they're law enforcement officers, so they have weapons on them, and they showed up in this community to start walking through, and they're like, time out!
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:00.002]  We already don't trust you enough, and you're gonna show up unannounced!
[02:04:01.038 --> 02:04:03.339]  This guy's a leader in this culture.
[02:04:03.559 --> 02:04:08.340]  Yeah, the first thing you do when you show up somewhere, whether you're a reporter or the police, is you make contact with the locals.
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:10.361]  It was insane.
[02:04:10.401 --> 02:04:10.861]  They had to stop.
[02:04:10.881 --> 02:04:11.681]  They said, you're not going to go.
[02:04:11.701 --> 02:04:12.601]  You're going to scare people.
[02:04:12.621 --> 02:04:14.262]  You're going to walk in, knocking on doors.
[02:04:14.282 --> 02:04:17.502]  We're just coming in to see what the Tessie area.
[02:04:17.542 --> 02:04:19.763]  And it was probably rightfully so.
[02:04:19.823 --> 02:04:22.924]  These crews, they mean the best.
[02:04:22.944 --> 02:04:23.584]  They're on a mission.
[02:04:23.604 --> 02:04:24.724]  They have certain things.
[02:04:24.784 --> 02:04:32.629]   But my point is- Whoever's sending them in is not giving them basic sociological It's offensive.
[02:04:32.769 --> 02:04:34.211]  It's literally offensive.
[02:04:34.291 --> 02:04:35.252]  I'm not even Hawaiian.
[02:04:35.592 --> 02:04:36.313]  I was offended.
[02:04:37.053 --> 02:04:40.116]  I was embarrassed for government at that point.
[02:04:40.236 --> 02:04:45.661]  Here's the thing, they'd already been in communication with Archie and his team.
[02:04:46.102 --> 02:04:48.224]  They'd already been talking to him several times.
[02:04:48.749 --> 02:04:52.373]  But they can't let him know that I'm going to send 50 guys dressed up.
[02:04:52.913 --> 02:04:54.415]  So Steve, make your points.
[02:04:54.475 --> 02:04:55.556]  What's the bottom line here?
[02:04:55.576 --> 02:04:56.897]  Because people smell a cover-up.
[02:04:57.457 --> 02:04:59.439]  I've seen the meetings, the local government meetings.
[02:04:59.459 --> 02:05:00.360]  No one's buying it.
[02:05:01.381 --> 02:05:07.147]  Whether it's total perfect incompetence or some larger nefarious plan that you kind of alluded to, this is big.
[02:05:09.008 --> 02:05:19.051]  Yeah, so if you're constantly lying to the public and the public's finding out about your lies and it's being evident because the results don't lie, people stop trusting the government.
[02:05:19.111 --> 02:05:22.312]  I mean, the local Hawaiians were the Hawaiians were helping the Hawaiians, right?
[02:05:22.892 --> 02:05:28.294]  And so they set up their own EOC and they started doing their own calculations of who they know is missing.
[02:05:28.354 --> 02:05:29.754]  So they're not counting on the government.
[02:05:30.194 --> 02:05:35.256]  And that's why I'm saying this is a very interesting place.
[02:05:36.514 --> 02:05:42.696]  It was interesting for them as local Hawaiians to reach out to their Haole brothers going, hey, I need you because I trust you, right?
[02:05:43.216 --> 02:06:00.842]  And so I find that as this thing moves on, we're going to be back at this video we're talking about today, January 20th, when that whole locking of the arms of the Hawaiian people, the natives organizing this thing to bring everybody together, we're going to see exactly where this train is headed, right?
[02:06:01.182 --> 02:06:24.512]   What track is it set on and what new policies are put in place But our job, and I feel like it's my job, is to empower them and take all the knowledge and information I've had from all the past fires, all the past disasters, how government steps in, how BlackRock steps in, how their development departments step in, and buy up these properties.
[02:06:24.912 --> 02:06:25.312]  Exactly.
[02:06:25.373 --> 02:06:30.077]  We're about to find out, because we see the setup, but the confirmation will be them trying it.
[02:06:30.908 --> 02:06:33.650]  And the governor said two days in, we're going to take the land.
[02:06:34.110 --> 02:06:35.611]  That's, they're so arrogant.
[02:06:35.711 --> 02:06:36.672]  I mean, that's wild.
[02:06:37.673 --> 02:06:46.879]  And I know it firsthand because, you know, indirectly I've been on calls with the guys at BlackRock that actually operate in the system to buy into the system.
[02:06:47.539 --> 02:06:53.856]   So I have another call with them coming up and it's interesting because I know how this program works.
[02:06:54.297 --> 02:06:57.958]  And so, when we have a chance, Alex, we can talk about this offline.
[02:06:58.338 --> 02:07:05.600]  I can't put this out there, but I deserve to have a conversation with you about that specific thing of how this machine is working.
[02:07:05.980 --> 02:07:10.101]  No, I want you to continue to give us updates, because we don't even have the funds to get there and have the crew and do it.
[02:07:10.141 --> 02:07:11.421]  That's how much we're under attack.
[02:07:11.661 --> 02:07:13.122]  But just, you guys have the floor.
[02:07:13.162 --> 02:07:13.842]  I'll jump in here.
[02:07:14.702 --> 02:07:17.384]  Just as American citizens, what does your gut tell you?
[02:07:17.785 --> 02:07:19.326]  Or the locals saying, where do you see this going?
[02:07:19.366 --> 02:07:20.007]  I think you said it.
[02:07:20.547 --> 02:07:22.449]  They're already trying to take the land.
[02:07:23.029 --> 02:07:25.711]  And now that the public's awake, this is going to be explosive.
[02:07:26.152 --> 02:07:27.453]  And we're sad people died.
[02:07:27.493 --> 02:07:28.033]  It's terrible.
[02:07:28.073 --> 02:07:32.597]  But this is a beta test, like California, where they won't cut the trees around the power lines in areas.
[02:07:33.037 --> 02:07:34.178]  And then it causes the fires.
[02:07:34.218 --> 02:07:36.020]  I mean, this is the rewilding project.
[02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:39.663]  So I think BlackRock's about to run into a brick wall here.
[02:07:41.297 --> 02:07:43.958]  Yeah, I think that these people are banning together.
[02:07:43.978 --> 02:07:46.620]  The Hawaiian natives, they're used to wars.
[02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:53.303]  I mean, Lahaina is the capital, the kingdom, the Hawaiian kingdom, from the start in the 1700s, right?
[02:07:53.663 --> 02:07:56.165]  I mean, Archie Kaleppa's 8th generation Hawaiian.
[02:07:56.725 --> 02:08:06.650]  So, this is a place that's going to, I think it's going to come to a massive turf war, and they're hoping that the people are just going to give up their land.
[02:08:06.730 --> 02:08:14.403]   And I think that, you know, for the people that really say they want to do right, Help them rebuild what they had before, right?
[02:08:14.423 --> 02:08:21.449]  The Oprahs of the world, you know, the Jason Momoa's, all these other people that are out there, they're saying they're going to debase... That was my next question.
[02:08:21.769 --> 02:08:24.131]  She's worth two and a half million, he's worth 800 million.
[02:08:24.651 --> 02:08:32.537]  They put five million and a piece to a trust that they get paid back from, then they tell the public to give money.
[02:08:32.757 --> 02:08:33.918]  That really blew up in their face.
[02:08:34.929 --> 02:08:40.754]  Yeah, and what they're doing is they're using their influence to try to direct the way these people are going to rebuild.
[02:08:41.014 --> 02:08:44.337]  But if they follow the way they want it, they'll support it.
[02:08:45.111 --> 02:08:56.877]  Understand, they're already putting this trajectory to control what it is and how this little peasant-ville of workers and low-income is going to be their workforce to support their operations on the island.
[02:08:56.897 --> 02:08:58.218]  And that's the perfect microcosm.
[02:08:58.438 --> 02:09:09.224]  You've got some of the most expensive real estate in the world that was a whaling colony and the original seat of the Hawaiian royalty that was blue-collar, that wouldn't sell out, and then this magically happens to them.
[02:09:09.244 --> 02:09:11.065]  I mean, you couldn't make this stuff up.
[02:09:12.389 --> 02:09:23.899]  No, listen, you can talk about things being accidental, negligent, but there comes a point where you're like, you know what, you can't have this many constant missteps that did not be planned.
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:24.680]  Right?
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:32.948]  I mean, I'm just, you know, having responded to these things for 33 years, I've never seen anything ever like this.
[02:09:32.988 --> 02:09:34.029]  And I've never said that.
[02:09:34.609 --> 02:09:40.586]   This is one disaster on another level that is Let the shit happen.
[02:09:40.766 --> 02:09:46.472]  Let's sit back and let it slow play because eventually the people will just give up their property.
[02:09:46.492 --> 02:09:48.194]  They're just going to give up their property.
[02:09:48.234 --> 02:09:48.995]  Let's just have a choice.
[02:09:49.015 --> 02:09:52.258]  Let these things play out because they control all the puppet strings out here.
[02:09:52.359 --> 02:09:54.221]  Unless somebody steps in, they won't have a choice.
[02:09:54.501 --> 02:09:58.565]  Because they don't control the new zoning all of their grandfathered in.
[02:10:01.178 --> 02:10:05.040]  You've been there a month, you've been there covering this a month, or a little less than a month.
[02:10:06.081 --> 02:10:09.743]  What is the current, exclusion zone, what is the current cover-up like?
[02:10:11.464 --> 02:10:23.091]  Well, right now I think some of the stuff that's going on, on the environmental side of it, there's debris that they're taking off, what they call the Phase 1, and they're planning to stage it on a temporary location somewhere on the island.
[02:10:23.777 --> 02:10:27.500]  And we have friends that work on the internal part of that that are leading that task force.
[02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:35.466]  So once I find them where they're going to put that temporary site on, I'm going to watch what they're doing with that debris, all those toxic chemicals, all that stuff.
[02:10:35.506 --> 02:10:36.527]  Where's it being moved?
[02:10:36.867 --> 02:10:39.169]  The phase one toxic dump.
[02:10:39.209 --> 02:10:39.910]  Where's that being moved?
[02:10:39.970 --> 02:10:42.852]  Is that being buried on the island somewhere that's going to leach into the water?
[02:10:43.192 --> 02:10:47.916]  And then you have a health issue there that leaches into the ocean and the people's drinking water?
[02:10:48.496 --> 02:10:50.058]  Or is it being moved off island?
[02:10:50.098 --> 02:10:51.539]  And if so, where is that being dumped?
[02:10:51.559 --> 02:10:53.020]  Where's that toxic site being dumped?
[02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:54.880]  It's one of the biggest concerns people have right now.
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:56.221]  It's really, where is that stuff going?
[02:10:56.661 --> 02:11:05.722]  There's always, obviously there's a mistrust because, you know, if you talk to any Hawaiian out here, they feel the islands were stolen anyway by the United States.
[02:11:05.762 --> 02:11:06.562]  Well, I mean, they were.
[02:11:06.823 --> 02:11:07.203]  The U.S.
[02:11:07.243 --> 02:11:08.783]  government literally at the point of a gun took it.
[02:11:09.943 --> 02:11:10.103]  Yep.
[02:11:10.283 --> 02:11:12.284]  And they don't forget that.
[02:11:12.544 --> 02:11:19.285]  And this is not, this particular scenario only works to foster that, those ill feelings.
[02:11:20.518 --> 02:11:30.122]  It's very difficult to really assimilate with the community here because there is so much mistrust, and we feel it.
[02:11:30.362 --> 02:11:31.182]  We felt it when we got here.
[02:11:31.803 --> 02:11:33.123]  Well, they know who I am.
[02:11:33.183 --> 02:11:35.584]  I'm not bragging, but they know who I am.
[02:11:35.604 --> 02:11:40.826]  I probably wouldn't have known when I was a kid, but since I went back to the popular talk shows, they love me.
[02:11:40.867 --> 02:11:41.507]  They trust me.
[02:11:41.527 --> 02:11:46.649]  That's why I should probably get out there, but they definitely are anti-globalist.
[02:11:47.992 --> 02:11:54.716]  Yeah, and I think that the thing that most, what we as Americans can do is really support our Hawaiian family, right?
[02:11:54.996 --> 02:11:57.938]  To really come up behind them, ask them, what is it you need?
[02:11:58.418 --> 02:11:59.398]  What is it you want?
[02:11:59.679 --> 02:12:02.740]  And how can I be an instrument in supporting you in that?
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:12.946]  That's why I feel that putting this message out to your audience for January 20th, that this arm goes around this entire fire line, right?
[02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:15.801]  It's going to really start pushing.
[02:12:15.841 --> 02:12:17.921]  And relaunch that, because you talked about it 20 minutes ago.
[02:12:18.741 --> 02:12:20.222]  There's this big event you're talking about.
[02:12:20.242 --> 02:12:23.243]  They put black tarps up all around the town trying to cover it up.
[02:12:23.623 --> 02:12:24.643]  You're calling for the opposite.
[02:12:24.663 --> 02:12:25.223]  What will people do?
[02:12:26.404 --> 02:12:36.367]  So what we're calling for is on January 20th, there's going to be a unity, which is being led by the Native Hawaiians, to create an armed chain of people around the entire perimeter of the fire.
[02:12:36.947 --> 02:12:43.467]   It's going to be about 40,000 people that are going to send on Maui for January 20th
[02:12:43.467 --> 02:12:44.726]  for that event.
[02:12:44.726 --> 02:12:46.286]  And it's Unity Maui.
[02:12:46.286 --> 02:12:50.907]   So once I have the more details, it's already well into the works.
[02:12:50.907 --> 02:12:52.726]  It's coming together beautifully.
[02:12:52.726 --> 02:12:56.966]   But it's there for the Hawaiian people to make that line because they're protecting
[02:12:56.966 --> 02:12:57.966]  this area.
[02:12:57.966 --> 02:12:59.686]  I mean, this is definitely a test.
[02:12:59.686 --> 02:13:05.166]   As firefighters or as emergency experts, I get the power lines fell down in the fire
[02:13:05.166 --> 02:13:09.126]   and they blocked people in the town and they didn't give them water and they didn't turn
[02:13:09.126 --> 02:13:10.007]  on the emergency alerts.
[02:13:10.471 --> 02:13:15.693]  Looking at those fires, I'm not a firefighter, but I see, I didn't believe the direct energy stuff when they first said it.
[02:13:16.053 --> 02:13:21.956]  But then I see grass everywhere, trees, and hundreds of yards away from fires, cars are totally melted.
[02:13:22.297 --> 02:13:22.977]  What does that?
[02:13:25.606 --> 02:13:28.847]  There's definitely some videos out there that I can't explain.
[02:13:28.927 --> 02:13:33.589]  So I'll just say there's definitely a number of things that are being pushed out there.
[02:13:33.629 --> 02:13:34.209]  Let's start over.
[02:13:34.329 --> 02:13:39.871]  As a 30-year firefighter, a fire chief, you're saying you've seen things you can't explain.
[02:13:39.911 --> 02:13:41.452]  Elaborate on that.
[02:13:41.752 --> 02:13:45.013]  Just some of the videos and stuff that we've seen on social media.
[02:13:45.563 --> 02:13:49.506]  It's hard to put your finger on why a car is isolated in an area.
[02:13:50.887 --> 02:13:52.348]  The engine block is melted.
[02:13:52.908 --> 02:13:57.352]  There's no potential for radiant heat that you can see in that scenario.
[02:13:57.432 --> 02:14:02.856]  So logically speaking, from a fire dynamics standpoint, it doesn't look like something could do that.
[02:14:03.236 --> 02:14:08.417]   But by and large, Alex, this This looks again like a perfect storm.
[02:14:08.457 --> 02:14:15.181]  You're talking about a fire that's being laid down by 70 mile an hour winds, plenty of fuel, and nothing to stop it.
[02:14:15.341 --> 02:14:21.124]  So just like when you're outside a fire, I'm not a firefighter like you, but you're five feet from a fire, you feel that heat.
[02:14:21.444 --> 02:14:22.825]  There was just so much heat coming over.
[02:14:23.590 --> 02:14:24.210]  It will melt.
[02:14:24.330 --> 02:14:25.531]  It will melt the fire engine.
[02:14:25.551 --> 02:14:26.171]  It'll melt things.
[02:14:26.251 --> 02:14:27.532]  It'll just take it.
[02:14:27.912 --> 02:14:34.035]  Radiant heat in just a general, you have to be careful where you put an apparatus at one single commercial structure fire.
[02:14:34.536 --> 02:14:37.637]  If you're too close, you're going to damage that vehicle.
[02:14:38.098 --> 02:14:41.980]  So think about that, plus added oxygen, added fuel.
[02:14:43.821 --> 02:14:44.841]  The fire can't escape.
[02:14:44.881 --> 02:14:46.022]  The heat's laid down.
[02:14:46.082 --> 02:14:47.062]  It's like a bellwether.
[02:14:47.082 --> 02:14:48.643]  That's how blacksmiths work.
[02:14:50.624 --> 02:14:52.106]  Air into a fire, it makes it hotter.
[02:14:52.826 --> 02:14:53.387]  Exactly.
[02:14:53.507 --> 02:15:08.121]  So this is what, to me, looks like it created what you typically wouldn't see in a fire, the homes being burned to the ground because the fire just had nowhere else but to lay down on itself and it was continually fueled.
[02:15:08.381 --> 02:15:10.804]  This thing jumped amazing distances.
[02:15:11.324 --> 02:15:21.856]   Normally, and Steve will tell you this as well, He's got great experience with wildland firefighters from his standpoint as well, that things will jump.
[02:15:21.976 --> 02:15:23.197]  These brands will jump.
[02:15:23.237 --> 02:15:24.898]  Well, imagine 70 mile an hour jump.
[02:15:25.238 --> 02:15:26.419]  That's how fast this thing was.
[02:15:26.459 --> 02:15:27.780]  People could not get out of the way.
[02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:36.765]  I am really infuriated about the alarms not being sounded for sure, because this was a perfect example of an all-hazard alarm needing to be sounded.
[02:15:36.786 --> 02:15:38.707]  Yeah, we saw the mayor, I'm not a rocket scientist, but...
[02:15:39.648 --> 02:15:44.609]  If you raise an alarm, which is the best alarm system in the U.S., you see fire coming at you.
[02:15:44.649 --> 02:15:46.289]  You know what the alarm is saying.
[02:15:46.589 --> 02:15:49.310]  So the idea is, I didn't sound it because you'd run towards the fire.
[02:15:49.610 --> 02:15:50.430]  That doesn't make sense.
[02:15:51.550 --> 02:15:52.250]  That's insanity.
[02:15:52.570 --> 02:15:56.031]  They would know why as soon as they stepped out of their house, if they were able to.
[02:15:56.771 --> 02:15:58.092]  We've got about 10 minutes left.
[02:15:58.332 --> 02:16:05.573]  You guys just dump your guts here as experts in emergency management and firefighting about what went down here and what we should do.
[02:16:07.765 --> 02:16:11.307]  You know, you know, the thing is, this is happening more and more Alex, right?
[02:16:11.807 --> 02:16:13.008]  It's not just the fires.
[02:16:13.588 --> 02:16:16.209]  You see, like in that area, all the comms went out, right?
[02:16:16.270 --> 02:16:18.311]  So no one could actually contact loved ones.
[02:16:18.971 --> 02:16:25.094]  And so I always tell people every one area disaster, including, you know, Ian, Ida, this last one in Dahlia, right?
[02:16:25.154 --> 02:16:30.097]  Then you see this Lee, this hurricane that may join forces with another one that's pushing behind it, right?
[02:16:30.117 --> 02:16:40.580]   I always tell people, you know what, get a family plan together because it's not just the hurricanes, but if, What we see going into 2024, you better have a family plan together.
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:42.941]  You better have sat phones for every one of your family members.
[02:16:43.021 --> 02:16:45.282]  I have it for my wife and my kids, right?
[02:16:45.762 --> 02:16:47.022]  Everyone's phone numbers are plugged.
[02:16:47.182 --> 02:16:53.005]  Every one of the team members on SRP, every one of our vendors, fuel, power, security, everyone.
[02:16:53.025 --> 02:16:55.286]  And we do a quarterly call with everybody, right?
[02:16:55.306 --> 02:16:56.946]  Everybody knows where the meeting points are.
[02:16:57.407 --> 02:16:58.307]  Get your shit.
[02:16:58.945 --> 02:17:00.066]  Get your house in order.
[02:17:00.546 --> 02:17:01.487]  Get your house in order.
[02:17:01.807 --> 02:17:04.950]  Have a plan that's going to be nonverbal and verbal, right?
[02:17:05.290 --> 02:17:10.514]  Because the one thing that I see is so many lives were lost in this because they didn't know what was going on.
[02:17:10.535 --> 02:17:12.336]  They didn't know what direction it was going on.
[02:17:12.696 --> 02:17:16.579]  And the fact that so many kids were lost and people are not talking about it.
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:23.105]  I mean, there's so much pain in these people's eyes that we see here on a daily basis.
[02:17:23.245 --> 02:17:24.186]  It's horrific.
[02:17:24.886 --> 02:17:26.267]  It's something that should never happen.
[02:17:26.307 --> 02:17:29.173]   So I'm saying, Don't wait on the government.
[02:17:29.273 --> 02:17:32.274]  I mean, look, even if you go back to Northridge, right?
[02:17:32.294 --> 02:17:32.754]  1994, LA.
[02:17:33.714 --> 02:17:34.835]  The Northridge earthquake?
[02:17:35.795 --> 02:17:36.795]  Seven seconds.
[02:17:37.275 --> 02:17:40.436]  The entire fire department was maxed out in seven seconds.
[02:17:40.996 --> 02:17:42.076]  They're not coming for you.
[02:17:42.576 --> 02:17:44.357]  Law enforcement's not showing up at your house.
[02:17:45.557 --> 02:17:46.537]  Get your house in order.
[02:17:46.577 --> 02:17:47.217]  Get prepared.
[02:17:47.277 --> 02:17:47.877]  Get ready.
[02:17:48.358 --> 02:17:52.178]  And be prepared that if you want to stop an uprising, turn your cell phones off.
[02:17:52.738 --> 02:17:53.819]  Turn social media off.
[02:17:54.279 --> 02:17:54.979]  No one's moving.
[02:17:55.632 --> 02:17:58.395]  Learn how to operate without this, without this cell phone.
[02:17:58.515 --> 02:17:59.697]  Learn how to operate without it.
[02:18:00.558 --> 02:18:05.103]  I would say this in closing also, just as we're talking about the firefighters and the law enforcement.
[02:18:06.164 --> 02:18:07.545]  These were, these are Hawaiians.
[02:18:07.806 --> 02:18:08.967]  These were people from Maui.
[02:18:09.668 --> 02:18:11.069]  These are brothers and sisters.
[02:18:11.109 --> 02:18:12.451]  These are part, they're part of the community.
[02:18:13.007 --> 02:18:16.769]  And when you talk to the firefighters, they were just as desperate as everybody else was.
[02:18:17.230 --> 02:18:20.752]  This was a difficult scenario for all of everybody.
[02:18:20.792 --> 02:18:28.297]  And the firefighters, the first responders, the people that they tried their hardest to stop this thing from getting to the place that it got to.
[02:18:28.737 --> 02:18:33.460]  And the conversations that we've had with these frontline workers, you can see it in their face.
[02:18:33.959 --> 02:18:36.861]  That there's a there's a there's a weight of responsibility.
[02:18:36.941 --> 02:18:40.683]  They understood that they needed to be there for their community and they couldn't get there.
[02:18:40.723 --> 02:18:41.924]  They couldn't do what they needed to do.
[02:18:42.284 --> 02:18:43.505]  Firefighters got trapped.
[02:18:43.545 --> 02:18:44.825]  There's some videos out there as well.
[02:18:44.845 --> 02:18:47.727]  And they were clearly thankfully saved.
[02:18:48.097 --> 02:18:55.961]  But they got trapped in the fire trying to put this thing out, and I just want to throw that out that there's some great people in the federal... No, you're absolutely right.
[02:18:56.001 --> 02:18:58.122]  We don't blame individual firefighters or police.
[02:18:58.162 --> 02:18:59.102]  They're compartmentalized.
[02:18:59.482 --> 02:19:00.383]  You're on a radio.
[02:19:00.663 --> 02:19:02.044]  You're told, go block this road.
[02:19:02.524 --> 02:19:06.206]  Other cops are told, block that road in the town as the fire's coming.
[02:19:07.142 --> 02:19:11.206]  So we know the emergency manager was in Honolulu at a meeting.
[02:19:11.246 --> 02:19:12.547]  So was the other emergency manager.
[02:19:13.087 --> 02:19:15.609]  So we need an investigation of who gave the orders.
[02:19:15.909 --> 02:19:17.951]  We're not blaming individual officers or firefighters.
[02:19:18.271 --> 02:19:21.514]  They were just sent where they were supposed to go, but it was perfectly done.
[02:19:21.534 --> 02:19:22.835]  I mean, that's why you look at it.
[02:19:23.456 --> 02:19:29.261]  I mean, who would say when a fire is at people's backs and the highways open and you block people in?
[02:19:29.281 --> 02:19:30.562]  I don't know how you do that.
[02:19:32.318 --> 02:19:43.684]  But it's also shown the a lot of the people in the front line as far as the first responders, that leadership and upper management, they may not be on the same page.
[02:19:44.805 --> 02:19:55.123]   So if anything is shared, you know, put a big spotlight on this thing about it, is that people have to start looking out for the people and for themselves, you know?
[02:19:55.123 --> 02:19:57.123]  But let's elaborate.
[02:19:57.123 --> 02:20:05.623]   You have a hurricane with 70, 80 mile an hour winds, dry, news admitting mass fires, and the main managers go to Honolulu
[02:20:05.623 --> 02:20:06.623]  for a party.
[02:20:06.623 --> 02:20:12.123]  That's negligent right there, extreme negligence.
[02:20:12.123 --> 02:20:17.833]   They've got to go to jail so other managers don't think, "Hey, a hurricane's hitting us, we got dry stuff, they're
[02:20:17.833 --> 02:20:22.123]   predicting massive fires, I'm going to go party in a hotel on the next island."
[02:20:22.123 --> 02:20:23.123]  It's insane.
[02:20:23.123 --> 02:20:26.623]  And then whoever gave the orders, it's...
[02:20:26.669 --> 02:20:28.870]  It's hard to believe they gave orders this bad.
[02:20:29.111 --> 02:20:30.511]  Because it's so perfect.
[02:20:30.891 --> 02:20:35.593]  As the locals are saying at the city council meetings and everything, they're saying, it's so perfect.
[02:20:35.673 --> 02:20:37.274]  It's so screwed up.
[02:20:37.314 --> 02:20:42.757]  Because you're locked in a town, the fire's behind you, the cops are told, sorry, I'm told to keep you from going.
[02:20:43.057 --> 02:20:49.800]  If I was a cop and fire is rushing, they said 100 yards away, buildings are burning down and you don't let people out?
[02:20:50.780 --> 02:20:52.441]  I don't know how, it's bizarre.
[02:20:53.453 --> 02:21:05.165]  One thing to think about on the law enforcement side and these officers in a normal situation, when a power line goes down and normal situation, when a power line goes down, you do want to protect that area.
[02:21:05.185 --> 02:21:10.190]  It's a dangerous for a vehicle to go through a potentially powered up power line area.
[02:21:10.971 --> 02:21:15.796]  The problem is, is that happened in multiple, in several locations, two or several locations.
[02:21:16.563 --> 02:21:25.288]  On that on that front street, as I understand, and it happened because it happened that both law enforcement officers did the same thing they would normally do with a power line down.
[02:21:25.568 --> 02:21:29.410]  They redirected traffic and they pushed people back into the fire.
[02:21:29.470 --> 02:21:31.511]  They didn't know they were communicating between each other.
[02:21:31.551 --> 02:21:32.331]  This is what I understood.
[02:21:32.731 --> 02:21:35.733]  So it wasn't like somebody shut down.
[02:21:36.717 --> 02:21:44.780]  The exit paths, on purpose, they were just following what their normal procedure would be and not using common sense and say, hey, this is the only option.
[02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:47.221]  Yeah, I see 200 foot flames 100 yards away.
[02:21:47.241 --> 02:21:49.282]  I'm going to follow orders and not let people through.
[02:21:50.686 --> 02:21:52.767]  Right, it doesn't add up.
[02:21:53.187 --> 02:21:54.688]  Eventually that was changed or fixed.
[02:21:54.828 --> 02:22:07.572]  Well, there's one of the individuals who we know personally who actually confronted the cop because he drove on the side of the road, went around the traffic that was backed up for like an hour and a half, confronted the cop, said, hey, of all places you park your car, you're parking where the power lines are not.
[02:22:07.653 --> 02:22:08.733]  It's the only exit out.
[02:22:09.279 --> 02:22:11.279]  Move your car.
[02:22:11.279 --> 02:22:15.279]   At that point the guy saw that the crowd was actually starting to come up against him.
[02:22:15.279 --> 02:22:19.279]   He moved his vehicle, the cop moved his vehicle, he was the first one through,
[02:22:19.279 --> 02:22:22.279]   and then traffic, whatever was behind it, was starting to move.
[02:22:22.279 --> 02:22:26.279]   But the problem is a lot of people that got backed up in this traffic, turned around and went the other way.
[02:22:26.279 --> 02:22:29.279]   Or the other people turned around, they bailed from their vehicles also.
[02:22:29.279 --> 02:22:32.279]  So, it's the complexity of industrial society.
[02:22:32.523 --> 02:22:37.924]  It's great, we have running water, we have toilets, we have antibiotics, but it makes it really perilous.
[02:22:38.424 --> 02:22:40.785]  Gentlemen, we only got a minute left, or two minutes left.
[02:22:40.845 --> 02:22:41.945]  Each one of you, close and comment.
[02:22:42.245 --> 02:22:43.686]  Plug websites, tell people to support.
[02:22:43.706 --> 02:22:44.086]  What do we do?
[02:22:45.166 --> 02:22:49.107]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I put up a page just for personal planning.
[02:22:49.147 --> 02:22:52.808]  If you go to srp24.com forward slash prepare.
[02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:58.413]  That's just a good site, an area to get some of your stuff put together.
[02:22:58.433 --> 02:23:00.514]  There's no affiliate links on it.
[02:23:00.654 --> 02:23:03.415]  For us, it's just the stuff that we use, right?
[02:23:05.156 --> 02:23:17.743]  And the main thing that I can honestly say is just get your family prepared, get organized, be a part of a community of either be a CERT, get CERT certified, know what's going on on your local level, and get involved.
[02:23:17.783 --> 02:23:22.786]  Get involved with the, you know, see what the emergency plan is for your city, for your county.
[02:23:23.206 --> 02:23:24.267]  You know, for the state.
[02:23:24.307 --> 02:23:25.328]  Get familiar with those things.
[02:23:25.348 --> 02:23:26.989]  Get familiar with alternate routes.
[02:23:27.369 --> 02:23:33.373]  If something goes down, which way are you going to use that you're going to get out of that area without having to use main thoroughfares.
[02:23:33.733 --> 02:23:36.035]  And that may be like a river basin.
[02:23:36.995 --> 02:23:38.997]  So have an escape plan.
[02:23:40.037 --> 02:23:40.618]  Absolutely.
[02:23:41.598 --> 02:23:43.059]  For me, I just want to thank you.
[02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:46.942]  One month out, here you are bringing this topic back up again.
[02:23:46.982 --> 02:23:55.313]   And I think that if you can talk to your The colleagues that you work with across the aisle and say, we've got to keep this relevant for the Maui people.
[02:23:55.373 --> 02:23:56.354]  I think that's important.
[02:23:56.394 --> 02:24:01.560]  So as we move forward, your continued attention on this is so important.
[02:24:02.119 --> 02:24:03.719]  Oh, we're not going to forget about Lahaina.
[02:24:03.739 --> 02:24:04.820]  We're not going to forget about this.
[02:24:05.300 --> 02:24:09.301]  Because this is administrative mass murder through incompetence or by deliberate stuff.
[02:24:09.321 --> 02:24:13.122]  And the good news is they're rejecting Oprah and Bill Gates and all their crap.
[02:24:14.042 --> 02:24:17.643]  $1,000 a night, FEMA at the Four Seasons, owned by Bill Gates.
[02:24:17.703 --> 02:24:18.483]  People see through it.
[02:24:18.823 --> 02:24:19.883]  God bless you, gentlemen.
[02:24:20.224 --> 02:24:21.584]  Give us updates as this develops.
[02:24:21.604 --> 02:24:21.944]  Thank you.
[02:24:24.092 --> 02:24:24.552]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:24:24.572 --> 02:24:24.933]  God bless.
[02:24:24.993 --> 02:24:25.653]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[02:24:26.234 --> 02:24:27.035]  Steve and Sam.
[02:24:27.215 --> 02:24:27.515]  All right.
[02:24:28.116 --> 02:24:29.157]  I'm going to end this hour.
[02:24:29.477 --> 02:24:30.639]  We've got a guest host coming up.
[02:24:30.659 --> 02:24:35.403]  I'm going to do a few more minutes after this with some other stories we haven't hit, and then the guest host is going to take over.
[02:24:36.445 --> 02:24:40.449]  And I've got to go see Owen right after I get off here.
[02:24:40.629 --> 02:24:41.410]  I love Owen so much.
[02:24:41.450 --> 02:24:42.291]  He's such a man.
[02:24:42.331 --> 02:24:43.091]  He's so good.
[02:24:44.152 --> 02:24:44.953]  Like it's Boy Scout.
[02:24:46.476 --> 02:24:51.159]  This is like the archetypal, you think of an FBI agent would be in the 50s and they're trying to put him in jail next week.
[02:24:51.199 --> 02:24:53.360]  I gotta go talk to him and say, what do you want me to do?
[02:24:53.380 --> 02:24:55.882]  Cause you know, it's just, they're all the news.
[02:24:55.902 --> 02:24:57.563]  They're just thirsty for his blood.
[02:24:58.243 --> 02:24:59.064]  So I gotta do that as well.
[02:24:59.144 --> 02:25:00.364]  Owen comes up in one hour.
[02:25:00.785 --> 02:25:02.746]  Infowars.com forward slash show the war room.
[02:25:03.306 --> 02:25:04.487]  Jay Dyer is ready.
[02:25:04.587 --> 02:25:05.508]  I'll do five more minutes.

[02:25:12.327 --> 02:25:19.327]  [Music]

[02:25:25.707 --> 02:25:26.327]  news.

[02:25:53.133 --> 02:25:55.074]  Most brands are 5% curcumidin.
[02:25:55.475 --> 02:25:57.376]  And that still does a great thing for you.
[02:25:57.756 --> 02:25:59.517]  This is the strongest anybody makes.

[02:26:35.071 --> 02:26:45.618]  All right, final segment here before I hand the baton to the amazing expert on the New World Order, Jay Dyer, here today for Jay's analysis.
[02:26:45.658 --> 02:26:46.819]  But let me just say this here.
[02:26:50.321 --> 02:26:53.944]  Evil is incompetent, but it also has had organized crises.
[02:26:55.089 --> 02:26:56.650]  And so they know humanity's waking up.
[02:26:57.311 --> 02:27:04.698]  They know that if we're successful financially, we're more easily going to resist them.
[02:27:06.419 --> 02:27:10.223]  But if they control us and dumb us down and make us poor, it's harder for us to stand up.
[02:27:12.004 --> 02:27:16.028]  So it's an anti-Renaissance, anti-Western system.
[02:27:18.319 --> 02:27:23.060]  And that's why I can sit here all day and talk to listeners and viewers about how important this broadcast is.
[02:27:23.101 --> 02:27:28.342]  But have we not delivered our guests, our crew, our callers?
[02:27:28.642 --> 02:27:29.142]  So we have.

[02:27:33.884 --> 02:27:35.204]  We care about people.
[02:27:37.645 --> 02:27:38.525]  We're not globalists.

[02:28:28.672 --> 02:28:39.599]  I want to make like three bucks a tube on, but it's essential oil, the turmeric toothpaste, the whitening toothpaste, the activated charcoal toothpaste with all the essential oils.
[02:28:40.059 --> 02:28:41.520]  Those are at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:44.562]  And you need to take these to see how great they are.
[02:28:45.242 --> 02:28:46.062]  To experience it.
[02:28:46.183 --> 02:28:47.363]  X3 is almost sold out.
[02:28:47.643 --> 02:28:48.984]  How about an X2 in a year?
[02:28:49.484 --> 02:28:52.266]  Because it's a DEA thing and it's so pure.
[02:28:52.906 --> 02:28:54.707]  Everybody else says they have atomic iodine.
[02:28:54.727 --> 02:28:55.007]  They don't.
[02:28:55.027 --> 02:28:56.248]  It's a DEA controlled deal.
[02:28:56.528 --> 02:28:57.629]  We got a new manufacturer.
[02:28:57.649 --> 02:28:58.749]  They've gone through hell to make it.
[02:28:59.470 --> 02:29:00.250]  The testing's done.
[02:29:00.290 --> 02:29:00.791]  It's like 99% done.
[02:29:00.871 --> 02:29:03.232]  Supposed to be done six months ago.
[02:29:03.252 --> 02:29:03.572]  It's not.
[02:29:03.592 --> 02:29:04.873]  I mean, we would have it for you.
[02:29:05.493 --> 02:29:07.734]  We could say something's atomic iodine all day long.
[02:29:07.794 --> 02:29:08.175]  It's not.
[02:29:08.675 --> 02:29:10.376]  Atomic iodine goes right into your cells.
[02:29:11.854 --> 02:29:15.057]  We do have a manufacturer that has a small supply of atomic online, that's X3.
[02:29:16.318 --> 02:29:18.620]  It's that and two other types that helps with the upload.
[02:29:18.940 --> 02:29:20.342]  But X2 is the bigger enchilada.
[02:29:21.042 --> 02:29:22.123]  Who knows, we may never have it.
[02:29:23.035 --> 02:29:29.298]  Because this is something developed and launched by our researchers and Dr. Group and it may not be available anymore.
[02:29:29.338 --> 02:29:29.698]  I don't know.
[02:29:29.938 --> 02:29:30.638]  You want X3?
[02:29:30.999 --> 02:29:33.260]  The last supply, like 200 bottles is left right now.

[02:29:35.821 --> 02:29:37.702]  X3 is amazing.
[02:29:38.242 --> 02:29:39.983]  We have Vitamineral Fusion already sold out.
[02:29:40.403 --> 02:29:41.423]  Like I told you, it's not there.
[02:29:41.964 --> 02:29:43.184]  That's how you fund this.
[02:29:43.204 --> 02:29:44.745]  You want somebody to fight the new world order?
[02:29:45.265 --> 02:29:49.227]  He wants somebody to go to war with the big law firms and the globalists?
[02:29:49.547 --> 02:29:50.928]  Well, then you gotta support Trump.
[02:29:50.948 --> 02:29:51.729]  You gotta support us.
[02:29:51.809 --> 02:29:53.270]  I mean, we're here, folks.
[02:29:53.370 --> 02:29:55.631]  We're the knights in shining armor.
[02:29:55.671 --> 02:29:58.232]  And I'm not saying I'm some great guy, but I'm on the field.
[02:29:58.332 --> 02:29:59.353]  I'm in a fight with these people.
[02:29:59.773 --> 02:30:00.754]  I'm at point-blank range.
[02:30:01.877 --> 02:30:02.957]  I'm not playing games.
[02:30:03.537 --> 02:30:05.418]  I'm not sitting here doing Easy Street.
[02:30:05.758 --> 02:30:06.598]  I'm not selling out.
[02:30:06.878 --> 02:30:08.398]  I am totally committed.
[02:30:08.438 --> 02:30:10.059]  We've already had devastating victories.
[02:30:10.559 --> 02:30:19.181]  And like a rock in a pond, the ripple effects of what we've already done 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 29 years ago, is already coming back to us huge.
[02:30:19.861 --> 02:30:23.982]  That's why I know now, oh my gosh, the rocks we throw in now are even bigger.
[02:30:24.562 --> 02:30:25.242]  And that's not me.
[02:30:25.262 --> 02:30:25.982]  That's God.
[02:30:26.042 --> 02:30:26.823]  That's the Holy Spirit.
[02:30:26.843 --> 02:30:27.663]  That's all of us together.
[02:30:27.703 --> 02:30:31.424]  But we are like Godzilla fighting Megalon.
[02:30:31.484 --> 02:30:33.384]  We are in there, man.
[02:30:33.424 --> 02:30:35.665]  We are up against Gymera.
[02:30:35.745 --> 02:30:37.865]  We are literally dominating.
[02:30:38.486 --> 02:30:39.126]  We're winning.
[02:30:40.066 --> 02:30:41.806]  And it takes support.
[02:30:41.926 --> 02:30:42.847]  It takes word of mouth.
[02:30:42.927 --> 02:30:43.947]  It takes psychic energy.
[02:30:43.967 --> 02:30:44.527]  It takes prayer.
[02:30:45.007 --> 02:30:46.107]  It takes financial support.
[02:30:46.588 --> 02:30:48.148]  So you want to fight the New World Order?
[02:30:48.388 --> 02:30:51.589]  There's nowhere you can bet your money in a fight.

[02:31:32.882 --> 02:31:34.922]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of Alex Jones.
[02:31:34.982 --> 02:31:36.803]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:31:36.823 --> 02:31:58.788]   I want to rewind and go back a little bit to the history of modern revolutionary philosophy, and then we'll work our way up to today, and we'll see how that revolutionary philosophy is At work in the establishment's plans for austerity, ESG, lockdowns, and all the measures they want to put in place to enforce a technocracy.
[02:31:59.688 --> 02:32:09.791]  If we go back to this famous text that I always recommend, written by a defender of the establishment, Fire in the Minds of Men by James Billington, the origins of the revolutionary faith.
[02:32:11.127 --> 02:32:24.494]  He's of course not a conspiracy theorist but a person who was as an academic and a historian archiving and chronicling the history of revolutionary philosophy and thought from the time of the French Revolution all the way up until the early 20th century.
[02:32:25.235 --> 02:32:40.023]   And James Billington noted that to really understand today's revolutionary philosophies you have to go back to the faith of the original revolutionaries At the time of and right before the French Revolution and their influences, what were they influenced by?
[02:32:40.043 --> 02:32:43.606]  Well, they were influenced by philosophies like Platonism.
[02:32:44.206 --> 02:32:53.613]  There was a Byzantine Platonist named Plethon that influenced Spinoza, that influenced Weishaupt and other Jacobins.
[02:32:54.413 --> 02:33:04.033]   And the Philosophy of Pythagoras played a key element, as well as the philosophies of ancient pre-Socratics like Heraclitus.
[02:33:04.053 --> 02:33:07.297]  Heraclitus taught that all is fire and all is flux.
[02:33:07.877 --> 02:33:35.494]   And so one of the things that the early Illuminists, people like Weishaupt and a guy called Buonarroti, who were really influential on the Jacobins in the French Revolution, They decided to take certain symbols from ancient mystical religions like the Zoroastrians, and Zoroastrianism is a dualistic religion that believes there's always these two principles eternally fighting with each other throughout history, and that never ends.
[02:33:35.514 --> 02:33:38.936]  It's an eternal dualistic dialectical battle.
[02:33:39.597 --> 02:33:46.321]  That becomes kind of the basis for later hermetic philosophers like Hegel, who will influence people like Marx.
[02:33:47.529 --> 02:33:54.992]  But before we get to that, we have to understand that the French revolutionary philosophers had a radical view of equalitarianism across society.
[02:33:55.613 --> 02:34:00.895]  And they thought that because, well, what's the best way to fix man's ills?
[02:34:01.875 --> 02:34:08.378]  Man's ills relate to believing in any kind of hierarchy at all in the hierarchy of church and state.
[02:34:10.039 --> 02:34:21.156]   And so if we get rid of that and we put in place a radical egalitarian, equalitarian society, perhaps a form of utopia could develop or could be imagined.
[02:34:22.217 --> 02:34:36.546]  And so this is where entities like Masonic lodges and secret societies at that time began to be useful to certain revolutionaries to try to spread their revolutionary ideas against the notions of nobility and aristocracy.
[02:34:37.293 --> 02:34:45.400]  However, some of these were extremely radical in their views to the extent that they even believed that all things should be held in common, including wives and children.
[02:34:47.321 --> 02:34:54.968]  And one of the things they did was they took the doctrine of fire from Zoroastrians and from Manichaeans to be a symbol of their religion.
[02:34:55.728 --> 02:35:02.354]  Because if you think about it, fire is always kind of moving, it's hot, it never ceases to, it never comes to any rest.
[02:35:02.972 --> 02:35:15.481]  And so it's a perfect image for the old Heraclitian idea, the pre-Socratics and the philosophers, that everything is flux, nothing is true, nothing is stable, everything is perpetual revolution and change.
[02:35:16.302 --> 02:35:19.384]  And so the religion itself becomes change.
[02:35:20.505 --> 02:35:24.308]  The journey is the end, some of the Marxists have said in history.
[02:35:26.508 --> 02:35:31.791]  They borrowed their model on how to structure this inner party, outer party on the Jesuits.
[02:35:32.271 --> 02:35:34.772]  Doesn't mean that they were at this time actually Jesuits.
[02:35:34.852 --> 02:35:35.673]  I don't believe that they were.
[02:35:35.733 --> 02:35:44.137]  I think that Weishaupt himself did lead the Jesuits and borrow the structure for his society on how the Jesuits were structured.
[02:35:44.157 --> 02:35:52.061]  Although I think that eventually later Jesuits are part of this superstructure because they are eventually allied with the CIA in the 20th century.
[02:35:53.846 --> 02:35:56.547]  As is the papacy after the Cold War.
[02:35:57.327 --> 02:36:06.851]  And so what we have is this idea that we can structure an inner party and an outer party and we'll eventually have a happy equality, happy equalitarianism.
[02:36:08.151 --> 02:36:16.714]  There will be a completely natural religion that will be like the noble lie or the state-fostered, state-funded and created and controlled religion.
[02:36:18.473 --> 02:36:23.920]  And it will be something like a kind of civic nationalism or a civic global religion that H.G.
[02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:31.008]  Wells talked about, who's a consistent sort of ideological lineage of this conspiracy.
[02:36:31.529 --> 02:36:31.689]  H.G.
[02:36:31.709 --> 02:36:41.268]   Wells is a high-level Freemason, and so he knew about the positions and ideas of Weishaupt that would eventually become Basically, technocracy.
[02:36:41.769 --> 02:36:44.591]  And that's what HG Wells and the whole Royal Society pushed for.
[02:36:45.072 --> 02:36:56.502]  They later combined it, not just with egalitarianism, at least for the masses, but with the idea of the Malthusian idea of depopulation.
[02:36:57.904 --> 02:37:05.434]   Pythagoras is one of the key philosophy figures because Pythagoras was a A proto-communitarian, a proto-communist.
[02:37:05.814 --> 02:37:23.805]  The idea was to overthrow all traditional forms of nation-states, people-groups, all traditional forms of religion and statecraft, including the idea of the king, or any kind of hierarchy, to create this equalitarian society.
[02:37:24.648 --> 02:37:32.543]  But what's interesting is that in reality, I think the inner group, the inner elite, the inner party, they always knew that it wasn't really egalitarian.
[02:37:32.563 --> 02:37:34.106]  That's what they tell the people.
[02:37:34.875 --> 02:37:44.779]  To manipulate the masses, because these radical philosophies always had, for the most part, very powerful, wealthy, influential supporters in the background.
[02:37:45.199 --> 02:38:03.906]  And that's because more perceptive and more cunning people understood that philosophies like radical communism, radical socialism, Marxism could actually be tools for statecraft, tools for foreign powers, tools for changing the existing regime into something else.
[02:38:04.873 --> 02:38:13.398]  And as we progress in the history of Marxism, many of the classical Marxists continue this radical worship of flux and change.
[02:38:13.418 --> 02:38:18.001]  You find this in Lenin, you find it in Trotsky, you find it in Mao in their writings.
[02:38:18.862 --> 02:38:27.087]  And what that means is that there's no longer principles that are objective or outside of man that man submits to.
[02:38:27.667 --> 02:38:31.189]  So there's no principles of hierarchy in nature, right?
[02:38:31.209 --> 02:38:34.124]   Jordan Peterson talks a lot about Lobster hierarchies!
[02:38:34.244 --> 02:38:35.244]  Lobster dominance!
[02:38:35.904 --> 02:38:37.125]  The dominance hierarchies!
[02:38:37.305 --> 02:38:39.586]  Well, the dominance hierarchies are actually in nature.
[02:38:39.606 --> 02:38:41.828]  It is a principle of the natural order.
[02:38:42.328 --> 02:38:53.694]  But the consistent revolutionary realizes that all external impositions, including hierarchy in nature, is an unwanted oppression.
[02:38:54.214 --> 02:39:01.518]  And so by the time of, you know, post-Hegel and post-Marx, everything turns into an oppressor-oppressed control-power dynamic.
[02:39:02.128 --> 02:39:11.831]  And so it's no longer about anybody submitting to or having to recognize external principles of truth and falsehood, good versus evil, purpose.
[02:39:12.491 --> 02:39:13.652]  Purpose doesn't exist.
[02:39:13.752 --> 02:39:15.172]  Meaning doesn't exist in the world.
[02:39:15.232 --> 02:39:19.814]  It's all a social construct, just like everything else was a social construct.
[02:39:19.954 --> 02:39:21.374]  This is the inevitable result.
[02:39:21.494 --> 02:39:39.048]   It takes a few centuries for this to come about, but you go back to the skepticism of David Hume, David Hume is already beginning to psychologize all of these principles that the ancient and medieval world would have seen as actual principles operant in the external world.
[02:39:39.909 --> 02:39:44.273]  Essentialism, Aristotle's essences, those things existed in the world.
[02:39:44.873 --> 02:39:52.300]  A man is a man, a woman is a woman, authority is authority, objects have the identity that they have, a tree is a tree, a dog is a dog.
[02:39:53.004 --> 02:40:07.203]  When all of that begins to break down post-Enlightenment, post-David Hume, post-all these people, eventually what you get is post-Darwin and post-Nietzsche, a pure will to power, top-down control structure.
[02:40:07.978 --> 02:40:12.322]  With no intention of submitting to any kind of external principles.
[02:40:12.362 --> 02:40:13.143]  There are no laws.
[02:40:13.183 --> 02:40:13.884]  There are no rules.
[02:40:14.064 --> 02:40:18.448]  Everything is determined by, dictated by the establishment.
[02:40:18.508 --> 02:40:21.852]  That is the operating system that we're under today.
[02:40:22.272 --> 02:40:26.296]  The Hegelian idea that the state is the march of God in history.
[02:40:27.279 --> 02:40:44.968]  And the state in the Hegelian system, and this is why it works so well to blend with Marxism, the state is synthesizing and emerging into a superstructure that can even destroy itself in multiple revolutions because it's a secret inter-party state that runs the public states that we know of as the state.
[02:40:45.848 --> 02:40:58.836]  It can destroy itself and revolutionize itself to create the synthesis out of all of these oppositions, which is ultimately the technocratic one-world state, as all of these people envisioned centuries ago.
[02:40:58.916 --> 02:40:59.816]  That's where we're going.
[02:40:59.836 --> 02:41:00.737]  That is the plan.
[02:41:00.757 --> 02:41:01.617]  There's only one plan.
[02:41:02.098 --> 02:41:07.621]  And it's been the same plan, at least back to Weishaupt, in terms of the modern era, openly.
[02:41:08.855 --> 02:41:11.017]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:41:11.858 --> 02:41:21.428]  We're going to look at more examples of this in the modern era when we come back from this commercial break.
[02:41:21.468 --> 02:41:22.129]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:41:22.690 --> 02:41:23.811]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:41:24.682 --> 02:41:25.763]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:41:25.803 --> 02:41:27.684]  I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:41:27.704 --> 02:41:34.467]  We were talking about the history of managed dialectics and revolutionary control of both sides of major conflicts.
[02:41:35.167 --> 02:41:38.269]  And I want to kind of fast forward to a couple modern examples.
[02:41:39.149 --> 02:41:52.156]  And if we think about the recent information that popped up in regard to the supposed neo-Nazi groups out of nowhere, just all over social media, that it suddenly exists in everyone's purview.
[02:41:53.706 --> 02:42:05.593]  The irony here is that while the establishment has been telling us for many years that anyone who questions elections or who has conservative tendencies at all is a neo-Nazi, a fascist, right?
[02:42:05.693 --> 02:42:08.495]  If you follow Trump, you're a neo-Nazi, all this nonsense.
[02:42:09.184 --> 02:42:23.032]  Well, the irony is that the very groups that have been calling us out as these ridiculous positions, they're the ones that have been consistently funding and fostering the real neo-Nazi groups throughout the Ukraine.
[02:42:23.072 --> 02:42:26.574]  Going back to 2014, John McCain famously took a trip over there.
[02:42:27.034 --> 02:42:30.698]  Appeared on stage with the right sector probably sector people.
[02:42:30.758 --> 02:42:35.943]  Those are people connected to Oslo Battalion and Rachel Blevins of RT.
[02:42:35.983 --> 02:42:39.987]  She recently did a report where she interviewed one of these characters.
[02:42:40.808 --> 02:42:42.149]  Boneface I guess is his name.
[02:42:42.169 --> 02:42:43.711]  Sky looks like a total.
[02:42:45.552 --> 02:42:53.139]  Prison recruit guy who claims himself to have been trafficked around to these conflict zones by the FBI and the CIA.
[02:42:53.179 --> 02:42:54.221]  And that makes perfect sense.
[02:42:54.301 --> 02:42:54.901]  Why is that?
[02:42:55.422 --> 02:42:57.504]  Well, it ties into my dialectical control.
[02:42:58.161 --> 02:43:05.241]   theory here, my position here, that we went back to the French Revolutionary figures to look at.
[02:43:05.241 --> 02:43:11.281]   Fast forward to today, and if you go into the history of the Ukraine, what we find out is that really the Ukraine
[02:43:11.281 --> 02:43:16.641]  has been about a 75-year proxy for Western intelligence.
[02:43:16.641 --> 02:43:23.641]   This goes back to the World War II intelligence networks that were set up by Reinhard Galen.
[02:43:23.685 --> 02:43:33.096]  He was probably one of the most famous World War II intelligence operatives for the Germans, and he was very adept at creating and establishing vast spy networks.
[02:43:34.066 --> 02:43:34.987]  He's not the only one.
[02:43:35.007 --> 02:43:55.459]  There were other people involved in this, people like Otto Scorsene, members of the SS and so forth, who made up these networks, who post-World War II, when the Nazis were defeated, they reached out to Allen Dulles, Bill Donovan of the OSS, and James Jesus Angleton and said, I will hand you all of these networks.
[02:43:56.261 --> 02:44:01.129]  To use for, you know, Western intelligence, if you allow me to have my freedom.
[02:44:01.649 --> 02:44:07.558]  And so Galen went on to become the head of the BND, the German intelligence for all the way up until the 1960s.
[02:44:07.578 --> 02:44:07.618]  So.
[02:44:09.310 --> 02:44:31.271]  Nobody seemed to care about this Nazi history and pedigree, this is part of paperclip, because he made a deal and he was allowed to have that freedom status for turning over these networks, which the CIA then utilized to be part of Gladio to set up their stay-behind units in case of a supposed Stalinist Soviet invasion of Europe.
[02:44:31.952 --> 02:44:46.521]  But what happened is that a lot of these groups, these paramilitary fascist groups that were part of the P2 Lodge, the Gladio operation was really masterminded according to Paul Williams and people like Daniel Ganzer in his PhD thesis by Kissinger.
[02:44:46.541 --> 02:44:48.142]  So this is really a Kissinger project.
[02:44:48.829 --> 02:44:53.554]  To stave off any kind of Soviet invasion of Europe.
[02:44:54.135 --> 02:45:07.931]  But what happened was that this also allowed for a lot of networks and cells to be set up all throughout Europe that were trained in black ops, trained in terror, trained in bomb making, assassinations, mass shootings.
[02:45:08.536 --> 02:45:09.417]  So this is a fact.
[02:45:09.457 --> 02:45:14.440]  This all came out in the 1990s when Gladio first began to be exposed.
[02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:17.021]  And this is run by NATO.
[02:45:17.321 --> 02:45:29.610]   So in other words, NATO is essentially a terrorist organization in this regard, regard to Gladio, and NATO recently Declassified or came out or was declassified or just published.
[02:45:30.870 --> 02:45:33.392]  In the Grayzone did a great report about this in 2021.
[02:45:33.632 --> 02:45:39.016]  I think we did a full breakdown of this in one of the fourth hours of Alex a couple years ago when it came out.
[02:45:39.516 --> 02:45:42.499]  But it's NATO's cognitive warfare document.
[02:45:42.559 --> 02:45:46.141]  Now remember, we're supposed to be bad guys in the US.
[02:45:46.201 --> 02:45:47.882]  If you support Trump, you're a Nazi.
[02:45:48.403 --> 02:45:57.887]   But the actual establishment really does have and has utilized Nazis stay behind networks and units since World War II, famously.
[02:45:58.067 --> 02:46:06.949]  Public declassified document that Reinhard Galen's networks were taken over by the CIA in the post-World War II period.
[02:46:07.370 --> 02:46:16.692]  Now, those same networks under Galen sent people to train the Nazi groups that still exist today in the Ukraine.
[02:46:17.981 --> 02:46:20.222]  Now people, you may have heard of Stepan Bandera.
[02:46:20.282 --> 02:46:24.163]  He's one of the key figures that was running that for many years in the Ukraine.
[02:46:24.804 --> 02:46:29.846]  There are actual SS and people under Galen that were sent to train those people.
[02:46:31.206 --> 02:46:35.568]  So those post-World War II networks have always been there.
[02:46:36.306 --> 02:46:42.851]  And so this shows that the system is not actually interested in going after neo-Nazis and Nazis.
[02:46:42.911 --> 02:46:45.112]  That's all just for public purview.
[02:46:45.393 --> 02:46:51.737]  They're perfectly happy to fund, use these groups, even all the way up until John McCain flying over there, even up until to today.
[02:46:52.778 --> 02:46:58.482]  If it's useful to supposedly, you know, fight Putin, who's also Hitler.
[02:46:58.722 --> 02:46:59.803]  So it makes no sense.
[02:46:59.883 --> 02:47:03.546]  Funding actual neo-Nazi groups to fight against Hitler, Putin.
[02:47:04.387 --> 02:47:05.228]  Literally makes no sense.
[02:47:05.348 --> 02:47:06.810]  That's all propaganda, you see.
[02:47:07.531 --> 02:47:17.722]  But this completely destroys the narrative that the establishment, the system is genuinely concerned with combating the greatest threat to America, white supremacists.
[02:47:18.382 --> 02:47:21.726]  Well now wait a minute, then why are you funding the actual neo-Nazis in the Ukraine?
[02:47:22.544 --> 02:47:24.465]  And the media has made a big fuss about that.
[02:47:24.506 --> 02:47:25.966]  The media was complaining about this.
[02:47:26.027 --> 02:47:37.754]  Mainstream media was complaining about neo-Nazis being supported and aided in Ukraine all the way up until the Russian special military operation, which now it suddenly became an issue.
[02:47:38.034 --> 02:47:40.096]  Now there are no Nazis in Ukraine, you see.
[02:47:40.783 --> 02:47:46.347]  So Zelensky was corrupt, according to mainstream media, all the way up until the last few years.
[02:47:46.527 --> 02:47:47.527]  Now he's no longer corrupt.
[02:47:47.607 --> 02:47:48.368]  Now we have to support him.
[02:47:48.388 --> 02:47:57.674]  So you see the absurdity and the Orwellian contradictory notions involved in this Emanuel Goldstein style operation a la 1984, right?
[02:47:57.894 --> 02:48:02.056]  The cutout villains that are out there that are really just used by the system.
[02:48:02.977 --> 02:48:06.379]  And so this is an example of manipulation of dialectics.
[02:48:06.399 --> 02:48:09.521]  So you're supposedly bad for supporting Trump.
[02:48:10.169 --> 02:48:16.976]  You're a Nazi that supports Trump, the fascists support Trump, which is just completely ridiculous.
[02:48:17.496 --> 02:48:31.870]  Meanwhile, the actual establishment since 2014 at least, and it goes back older than that, you can go back to the 1980s, the West, the CIA was funding a lot of these groups as well back then, and all the way back as we said to the post-World War II era.
[02:48:32.970 --> 02:48:41.757]  When Ukrainian nationalism, at least right after World War I, was erected as this bulwark against Sovietism.
[02:48:42.497 --> 02:48:46.420]  And they utilized these Nazi networks to do that, which have been there for a long time.
[02:48:46.660 --> 02:48:54.126]  I mean, the Nazi networks post-World War II, but the anti-Russian sentiment at least back to, you know, 75 years there.
[02:48:55.444 --> 02:49:06.195]  So this is a geostrategic plan that plays into large-scale dialectics and it just demonstrates that the establishment really has no desire to actually combat Nazism.
[02:49:06.536 --> 02:49:15.445]  That's just a weapon and a tool that they use to smear and go after anybody in the United States who has mildly conservative views, you see.
[02:49:16.087 --> 02:49:22.689]  That's dialectical manipulation, and that shows that these are not real threats in America, right?
[02:49:22.709 --> 02:49:29.090]  There are occasional wackos and people oftentimes that might even be goaded by the feds to act in this kind of a way.
[02:49:29.630 --> 02:49:35.311]  But if you look up the documentary, The Newburgh Sting, which there was a radical mosque set up, which was a honey trap.
[02:49:35.752 --> 02:49:41.753]  If you look up the history of Elohim City and McVeigh, same type of honey trap operation.
[02:49:42.613 --> 02:49:58.438]  And I think that the danger is that, I think Whitney Webb pointed this out, these same groups from Ukraine might be utilized to spark some kind of fake event, staged event here in the U.S., at least after all of this Twitter furor with Musk.
[02:49:58.598 --> 02:50:01.979]  So the danger is an event like Alex has been talking about.
[02:50:02.059 --> 02:50:02.939]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:02.979 --> 02:50:03.339]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:50:03.359 --> 02:50:04.300]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[02:50:06.367 --> 02:50:07.628]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:07.668 --> 02:50:09.209]  I'm your guest, Mr. Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:50:09.249 --> 02:50:24.757]  We just talked about the, in the last segment, the manipulated control groups like the neo-Nazis in the Ukraine, which are really assets for the West, proxy groups to be used to put pressure on Russia.
[02:50:26.497 --> 02:50:37.828]  The absurdity of sort of calling out anybody who would question that or would question recent events as, you know, Trump Nazis or some sort of ridiculous thing like this.
[02:50:37.848 --> 02:51:04.669]   So, but I wanted to now move to a NATO document that we mentioned, the cognitive warfare document, because if you heard Alex yesterday when he was talking about The Greg Reese report or the John Bowne report on the DARPA lecture that was given in 2017 about various kinds of nanotech weaponry that could be rolled out that might relate to a new pandemic or something like that.
[02:51:05.743 --> 02:51:19.101]  That lecture is very similar to what was warned about, or excuse me, what was presaged, I guess you could say, in the 2020 NATO study Cognitive Warfare.
[02:51:19.121 --> 02:51:24.365]   And when this The PsyOps document came out in 2020.
[02:51:24.605 --> 02:51:33.389]  It was actually utilized, its principles were utilized by the Canadian government to push a lot of the COVID fear and narrative.
[02:51:33.909 --> 02:51:40.712]  So there's an actual lecture that a lot of NATO people in Canada, the Canadian government utilized this document.
[02:51:40.732 --> 02:51:43.193]  They even talk about how they would utilize all this fear.
[02:51:44.076 --> 02:51:51.365]  And that anybody who questioned the establishment and the narratives that were being put out would be considered potential enemy combatants.
[02:51:51.385 --> 02:52:00.917]  So, in other words, the domestic population not wanting to go along with vaccines, not wanting to go along with vaccine passports, vaccine tracking.
[02:52:02.005 --> 02:52:18.917]  Total surveillance, that would be considered in terms of cognitive warfare, this new version of hybrid warfare, a potential enemy combatant status, and that you could even be linked into this, you know, database or whatever, without knowing it you would be targeted.
[02:52:19.497 --> 02:52:45.718]   And so it's a very Ominous, dystopian kind of presentation and document where drones, autonomous vehicles, and the development of biological and chemical neuro-weapons, as they call it, would be pursued to not just alter, as classical psychological operations did, the ideology of the enemy, but as this document says, to actually change the biology and the brain itself of the enemy.
[02:52:46.278 --> 02:52:50.961]  That, again, perfectly overlaps with the lecture from the DARPA guy.
[02:52:51.642 --> 02:53:09.833]  And so this kind of weaponization of neuro-research, or neuro-ST as they call it, could mean then that the opponents would not just become passive, but actually might be neutralized, which sounds, of course, like they could put you to death.
[02:53:11.986 --> 02:53:16.848]  It's no longer just changing the opponent's mind, but exactly what Klaus said.
[02:53:16.928 --> 02:53:18.169]  We will change your DNA.
[02:53:18.209 --> 02:53:19.050]  We'll change you.
[02:53:19.750 --> 02:53:20.930]  We'll be under your skin.
[02:53:20.990 --> 02:53:22.131]  That's the real goal.
[02:53:22.631 --> 02:53:25.793]  That's exactly what the NATO Cognitive Warfare document says.
[02:53:26.533 --> 02:53:42.501]   And so you understand that the development of controlling both sides of conflicts over the centuries, the mastering of what we call dialectical philosophy from Plato to Marx to Hegel, And subsequent philosophers after that.
[02:53:43.141 --> 02:53:55.148]  This really, Darwinism even you could argue, this really allows the establishment to have this position beyond what most people are involved in, in terms of conflicts.
[02:53:55.648 --> 02:54:03.813]  You can think of it like a circle, and within that circle is the accepted Overton window of what you can and can't talk about.
[02:54:04.569 --> 02:54:10.092]  And what types of things are allowed in public discourse, even in terms of the questions that are asked.
[02:54:10.732 --> 02:54:24.639]  So, for example, you wouldn't be allowed to, it's not even considered within the purview of the possibility, to ask a question like, well, could the wars of the 20th century have been intentionally fostered by an elite or a superstructure?
[02:54:24.839 --> 02:54:26.340]  That's not an allowed question.
[02:54:26.360 --> 02:54:30.702]  It's not within the domains, the parameters, the magic circle of what can and can't be discussed.
[02:54:31.511 --> 02:54:39.235]  And so a big part of perception management that Kissinger talks about is has nothing to do ultimately with what's true or false.
[02:54:39.796 --> 02:54:47.039]  All that matters is managing the public's perception of what things are possible and not possible, what questions can and cannot even be asked.
[02:54:47.740 --> 02:54:56.888]   This is also famously covered by the Well known philosopher Eric Vogelin, who talked about how technocracies operate in a neo-gnostic way.
[02:54:56.908 --> 02:55:03.874]  There's a sort of inherent neo-gnostic principle that it sets the parameters of what questions can and can't be asked.
[02:55:04.095 --> 02:55:06.617]  So you're not even allowed to ask a question like.
[02:55:07.330 --> 02:55:22.647]  Has there been a revolutionary plan for the last several centuries going back to Billington's Fire in the Minds of Men theorizing and analysis that you get French revolutionary, you know, communist socialists, proto-technocrats even back then?
[02:55:22.807 --> 02:55:23.628]  That's not a question.
[02:55:24.069 --> 02:55:25.711]  That's a nonsense question.
[02:55:25.891 --> 02:55:26.712]  You're not allowed to ask that.
[02:55:27.788 --> 02:55:35.754]  And that's why the media, mass media, has been there for so long to control and set the parameters for the questions that are allowed to be asked and that are not allowed to be asked.
[02:55:36.154 --> 02:55:40.837]  Nowadays, media is basically there, I think, to just sort of confuse the public.
[02:55:41.238 --> 02:55:48.463]  And so you get this overwhelming, this avalanche of data that's all conflicting and contradictory and confusing.
[02:55:49.196 --> 02:55:51.157]  And that's intentional, right?
[02:55:51.197 --> 02:55:56.440]  The public doesn't have an education in how to know these things and patterns in history.
[02:55:56.780 --> 02:55:57.961]  There are no patterns to history.
[02:55:58.381 --> 02:55:59.702]  History doesn't exist, right?
[02:55:59.742 --> 02:56:00.082]  Remember 1984?
[02:56:00.642 --> 02:56:02.623]  There is no such thing as history.
[02:56:02.963 --> 02:56:06.105]  It's whatever the party writes at that moment.
[02:56:06.585 --> 02:56:09.346]  And that's all part of that new revolutionary dialectic.
[02:56:09.507 --> 02:56:14.009]  Basically, all of modernity is premised on liberalism.
[02:56:15.254 --> 02:56:19.437]  And by liberalism, I don't mean GOP, RINO, that stuff.
[02:56:19.777 --> 02:56:21.939]  I don't mean Democrats.
[02:56:22.739 --> 02:56:32.786]  I mean post-Enlightenment removal of the notion of all forms of hierarchy in nature, all forms of meaning and principles in the external world.
[02:56:32.826 --> 02:56:35.428]  Those don't exist anymore, according to the establishment.
[02:56:36.789 --> 02:56:43.694]  And Hegel, I think, is a key figure because Hegel really said that the state is God's and the state will tell you what's meaningful.
[02:56:44.304 --> 02:56:58.308]  That's why it was a very big deal when there was starting to be pushback, what, a year ago or so, on the notion of whether or not the infants, right, have the principle of being made in the image of God or have life from the womb.
[02:56:58.868 --> 02:57:02.569]  Or is the right to life something dictated by the state?
[02:57:03.790 --> 02:57:09.391]  In the Hegelian sense, in the technocrat sense, the state dictates when you're alive.
[02:57:09.731 --> 02:57:35.409]   And so perhaps you're not alive or Conscious until age 3 maybe you're a potential person, but you're not a human person until age 3 well Then you could be conceivably aborted up to age 3 and there are some radical people out there who push for that I think Peter Singer pushes for that as well as a bunch of other nasty things supposedly ethical philosophers, right and so the establishment has invested interest obviously in the the state and
[02:57:36.181 --> 02:57:47.869]  The super state, the corporate state, the technocratic state, dictating meaning, dictating what's true, dictating gender, dictating all of these things as not real, as whatever you want it to be.
[02:57:48.709 --> 02:57:56.134]  And so there's a cloak of freedom and liberty that's actually a tool for social control.
[02:57:56.992 --> 02:58:06.635]  Telling you, telling children, telling people that you can be and identify as whatever you want to, is a method of destruction and control that is intentional.
[02:58:07.095 --> 02:58:07.775]  It is a weapon.
[02:58:08.215 --> 02:58:09.376]  Tavistock developed it.
[02:58:10.016 --> 02:58:14.637]  It's not good-hearted liberals that want to do right and want to help people.
[02:58:15.398 --> 02:58:20.059]  Maybe at the lower levels, there's people who, the normies out there, maybe they operate that way.
[02:58:21.019 --> 02:58:27.818]   But at the higher levels, this is fourth, fifth, sixth generation hybrid warfare.
[02:58:27.818 --> 02:58:31.818]  It's intentional destruction of what came before.
[02:58:31.818 --> 02:58:36.698]   And more and more people are picking up on this, that the plan was to actually destroy
[02:58:36.698 --> 02:58:41.737]   the existing systems, destroy from within the existing medical system, the existing
[02:58:41.737 --> 02:58:46.378]   political systems, the nation state, destroy even the education system, let all of these
[02:58:46.378 --> 02:58:50.619]   collapse and crumble from within, the same way that like Cloward and Piven is intended
[02:58:50.619 --> 02:58:59.179]   to put stressors on the economic system to break it down, to accelerate the next phase.
[02:58:59.159 --> 02:59:00.660]  That's dialectical thinking.
[02:59:00.860 --> 02:59:06.023]  You can intentionally cause chaos and destruction because chaos and destruction furthers the dialectic.
[02:59:06.283 --> 02:59:09.185]  The process furthers the process.
[02:59:09.565 --> 02:59:12.987]  Process philosophy, Hegel, Whitehead, right?
[02:59:13.767 --> 02:59:18.530]  These are almost revolutionary faiths.
[02:59:18.930 --> 02:59:23.813]  In other words, the faith, as he calls it, notice at the bottom of the book, it's the revolutionary faith.
[02:59:27.102 --> 02:59:30.583]  Because there's a religious commitment to creative destruction.
[02:59:32.204 --> 02:59:44.529]  And so, that can be weaponized, that can be utilized, and military strategists, people who study, you know, civilization, civilization studies, they are aware of this, and they know it can be weaponized.
[02:59:45.229 --> 02:59:46.010]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:46.030 --> 02:59:47.630]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:59:48.230 --> 02:59:49.271]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:49.291 --> 03:00:08.652]   We're talking about the big picture plan of what the elite For at least a few centuries in the modern era have as their goal, and that is ultimately what was published by World Economic Forum luminary Noah Yuval Harari in his book Homo Deus.
[03:00:09.672 --> 03:00:15.957]  So for many, many years, of course, we've been talking about this and we've been explaining that this is the ultimate plan.
[03:00:16.037 --> 03:00:27.946]   Alex has talked about it right all the way back To Ray Kurzweil and Endgame and even before that, that the idea was that technology would allow man to evolve into being his own god.
[03:00:28.872 --> 03:00:34.756]  And there are older books that kind of presage this as well that were way ahead of their time.
[03:00:34.776 --> 03:00:41.960]  I remember some years ago, I read AC Wells' Island of Dr. Moreau, which I'll be covering on my channel in the near future.
[03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:43.701]  We haven't looked at that many, many years.
[03:00:43.781 --> 03:00:49.885]  And one of the theories that was way ahead of its time in that book was the plasticity of human nature.
[03:00:50.663 --> 03:01:01.128]  Now, there can be malleable plasticity elements to human nature which are there, but we shouldn't conclude from that that therefore it's all plastic.
[03:01:01.528 --> 03:01:08.451]  We're all just Gumby people and there's no actual metaphysical meaning or that there's no chromosomes.
[03:01:08.571 --> 03:01:09.551]  None of that, right?
[03:01:09.571 --> 03:01:10.812]  We're not just Gumby people.
[03:01:11.352 --> 03:01:12.873]  We have identity over time.
[03:01:12.913 --> 03:01:14.554]  There is such a thing as human nature.
[03:01:14.574 --> 03:01:15.294]  It does exist.
[03:01:16.015 --> 03:01:33.458]   But the premise of Dr. Moreau, if you don't know, is that there's this sort of mad science doctor who's got a god complex on an island and he's experimenting and creating genetic hybrids and he's creating these sort of Um, you know, monstrosities.
[03:01:34.218 --> 03:01:41.420]  And, uh, so somebody stuck on this island and they're trying to get off of it because it's kind of a, uh, the island, it's kind of a microcosm of the world.
[03:01:41.460 --> 03:01:52.462]  You could say the island represents sort of the future, um, dystopian world that could develop, uh, as a result of, you know, DNA splicing and all that in the mind of HG Wells.
[03:01:52.502 --> 03:01:53.222]  I think you wrote that in 1896.
[03:01:54.122 --> 03:01:56.643]  So he was way ahead of his time in that regard.
[03:01:57.501 --> 03:02:00.824]  As an insider of what the future plans were.
[03:02:01.084 --> 03:02:07.870]  Now, if we fast forward to today, Harari's book, and by the way, he's a historian, so he's not a scientist.
[03:02:08.430 --> 03:02:12.293]  You know, the establishment is always interested in, do you have the credentials?
[03:02:12.814 --> 03:02:14.895]  He's not actually a scientist, so he's a historian.
[03:02:14.935 --> 03:02:27.419]   But this book was published in 2016, and the idea from the very beginning of the book is that there's not a There's not a meaning external to man.
[03:02:28.379 --> 03:02:30.701]  Man creates all of his own meaning.
[03:02:31.221 --> 03:02:32.522]  He doesn't discover meaning.
[03:02:32.562 --> 03:02:33.983]  He doesn't discover principles.
[03:02:34.604 --> 03:02:35.764]  He creates these things.
[03:02:35.804 --> 03:02:43.990]  And so the second chapter, for example, is that, or excuse me, the second section is that man gives meaning to the world.
[03:02:44.771 --> 03:02:46.472]  So we create our own meaning.
[03:02:46.532 --> 03:02:48.293]  Meaning is not something that we discover.
[03:02:49.214 --> 03:02:50.735]  We create our own meaning.
[03:02:52.552 --> 03:02:57.757]  And if we can create our own meaning, then we can create our own godhood eventually, right?
[03:02:57.777 --> 03:03:05.985]  That's the point of where the book goes is that we are evolving beyond old stories of religion to a new humanity.
[03:03:06.025 --> 03:03:07.226]  He calls it a new human.
[03:03:08.067 --> 03:03:08.988]  What's the new human?
[03:03:09.008 --> 03:03:17.638]   The new human is the coming No longer interested in religion, human, but the religion of AI or what he calls dataism.
[03:03:17.918 --> 03:03:24.881]  So the religion of the future, the religion that's an emerging deus ex machina right now is data, dataism.
[03:03:24.962 --> 03:03:28.663]  And the future will all be about pure raw data.
[03:03:29.504 --> 03:03:30.944]  That will be the new meaning.
[03:03:31.825 --> 03:03:36.407]  And again, meaning is not something that's a principle in the world.
[03:03:37.483 --> 03:03:39.184]  Purpose is not something in the world.
[03:03:39.764 --> 03:03:40.764]  Things don't have purpose.
[03:03:40.784 --> 03:03:41.325]  They don't have meaning.
[03:03:41.745 --> 03:03:43.206]  Everything is evolving, you see.
[03:03:43.366 --> 03:03:51.909]  So he's within this tradition of the same revolutionary philosophers that we were talking about, that everything is in evolutionary flux.
[03:03:52.510 --> 03:03:54.651]  Since everything is in flux, there's no stability.
[03:03:54.671 --> 03:03:55.511]  There's no fixity.
[03:03:56.331 --> 03:03:57.352]  It's either or.
[03:03:57.372 --> 03:04:00.953]  You either believe in everything being in stasis or everything's in flux and change.
[03:04:01.694 --> 03:04:07.016]  Well, if everything is flux and change, then the principle that everything is flux and change would also be subject to change.
[03:04:07.719 --> 03:04:08.699]  That's self-refuting.
[03:04:08.759 --> 03:04:12.080]  So obviously it's not true that everything is flux and change.
[03:04:12.620 --> 03:04:14.260]  That's a self-refuting statement.
[03:04:15.601 --> 03:04:17.921]  There's both fixity and change in the world.
[03:04:18.061 --> 03:04:19.441]  There's stasis and change.
[03:04:20.141 --> 03:04:21.162]  Both of those things are true.
[03:04:22.282 --> 03:04:25.743]  Objects have identity over time, and they change.
[03:04:25.763 --> 03:04:28.683]  It can be a both-and, not an either-or.
[03:04:28.743 --> 03:04:32.984]  And a lot of bad philosophical mistakes are premised on false either-ors.
[03:04:34.460 --> 03:04:37.642]  But also, so is dialectical manipulation.
[03:04:38.342 --> 03:04:40.103]  It's premised on false either-ors.
[03:04:40.543 --> 03:04:42.284]  You're either with us or you're with the terrorists.
[03:04:43.265 --> 03:04:44.085]  Well, wait a minute.
[03:04:44.505 --> 03:04:47.467]  What about a third option where both of you are wrong?
[03:04:47.727 --> 03:04:51.049]  What if I don't like neoconservatism or terrorism?
[03:04:52.489 --> 03:04:53.770]  No, I have to choose either-or.
[03:04:53.790 --> 03:04:54.610]  It's a false either-or.
[03:04:54.630 --> 03:04:59.593]  It's a very low-level manipulation, and that's a fallacy in logic.
[03:05:00.174 --> 03:05:06.276]  But you'll notice a lot of propaganda, a lot of government pronouncements and, you know, old school Bush speeches.
[03:05:06.296 --> 03:05:08.796]  They operate on basic fallacies.
[03:05:09.276 --> 03:05:12.357]  But the fallacies are very useful in propaganda, you see.
[03:05:12.997 --> 03:05:16.458]  For example, appeals to emotion are used all the time in propaganda.
[03:05:17.699 --> 03:05:22.380]  Oh, do you support the death of children?
[03:05:22.420 --> 03:05:23.000]  Do you support?
[03:05:23.040 --> 03:05:23.920]  Oh, you must support.
[03:05:23.940 --> 03:05:30.907]   So if you don't like the Iraq war, it's because you like Saddam throwing babies out of incubators.
[03:05:31.148 --> 03:05:35.377]  You see how low IQ and silly this is, but it works, right?
[03:05:35.417 --> 03:05:41.156]   That's very useful because most of the public Doesn't operate in a critical thinking way.
[03:05:41.636 --> 03:05:44.017]  They operate, unfortunately, on an emotional basis.
[03:05:44.197 --> 03:05:49.960]  And so there's an emotional reaction to these propaganda, which most of the time they're fake news stories, right?
[03:05:50.400 --> 03:05:54.222]  Especially things that are intended to provoke war, right?
[03:05:54.962 --> 03:06:00.584]  Oh, the barbarian, for example, Tavistock got really sophisticated with this.
[03:06:01.085 --> 03:06:02.965]  Before it was Tavistock, it was called Wellington House.
[03:06:03.766 --> 03:06:18.218]   And The Brice Report wrote up all these stories about how the leader of Germany, the Kaiser, the Kaiser was the butcher.
[03:06:18.898 --> 03:06:27.843]  And they just called him the butcher, the beast and butcher, I think they even called him the butcher of Baghdad, or something akin to that, the butcher of whatever, the butcher of Germany.
[03:06:28.143 --> 03:06:32.966]  And then they used that butcher of Baghdad for, it was the exact same propaganda they used for the Kaiser.
[03:06:34.083 --> 03:06:36.184]  And it doesn't even matter if the stories are true.
[03:06:36.264 --> 03:06:41.027]  It's just in the media that, oh, he's the butcher of, yeah, we got to take down that Saddam because he's the butcher.
[03:06:41.867 --> 03:06:46.590]  But he's, I mean, Saddam was trained by the CIA and put in by the CIA, famously, well known.
[03:06:47.090 --> 03:06:55.755]  So the same people who can be established, set up by the system, by the West, can then be dispensed with and thrown away when they're no longer needed.
[03:06:56.355 --> 03:07:03.400]   And that's the unfortunate nature of Dialectical manipulation and big geopolitics, but it's all playing out right now.
[03:07:03.520 --> 03:07:07.287]  We just see this with these fake, right, neo-Nazi groups.
[03:07:08.448 --> 03:07:13.477]  And that ultimately ties into the long-term picture, I would argue.
[03:07:14.190 --> 03:07:34.579]  Because the people who are pushing Malthusianism, all the Great Reset crowd, the Davos crowd, Jane Goodall, all those types, Harari, all of those people pushing Great Reset are the same ones that have a face, a veneer of democracy, liberalism, concern.
[03:07:34.619 --> 03:07:36.280]  Oh, we care about the environment.
[03:07:36.900 --> 03:07:38.341]  We care about immigrants.
[03:07:39.201 --> 03:07:39.681]  No, they don't.
[03:07:40.342 --> 03:07:43.403]  These are the same people who want the population scaled down.
[03:07:45.323 --> 03:07:48.765]  90%.
[03:07:47.364 --> 03:07:48.765]  There's not an actual concern.
[03:07:48.785 --> 03:07:50.646]  That's all for PR.
[03:07:51.246 --> 03:07:51.987]  That's a cloak.
[03:07:52.347 --> 03:07:57.949]  And Alex has talked about the liberal cloak all the way back to what Obama deception, right?
[03:07:58.970 --> 03:08:04.152]  And yet it still fools people to think that the left cares about humanity.
[03:08:04.232 --> 03:08:09.915]  No, the left is a Malthusian cult, a death cult in its inner core.
[03:08:10.275 --> 03:08:24.619]   And it controls a giant Gollum zombie mind control being this entity of all these people that are in this bored hive that believe that well, they're just basically completely controlled androids, right?
[03:08:24.759 --> 03:08:27.203]  I put up a video that humans are becoming robots.
[03:08:28.304 --> 03:08:34.167]  And I don't just mean androids in the sense of like, you know, technology and brain implants.
[03:08:34.207 --> 03:08:34.848]  Yeah, that's true.
[03:08:34.968 --> 03:08:43.972]  But people are already androids in the sense of being completely controlled by false narratives and completely worshipping the system.
[03:08:43.992 --> 03:08:45.273]  They're already in a cult.
[03:08:45.973 --> 03:08:58.302]   And so they're all the more going to be susceptible to accepting whatever comes down the pipe when we're told, as the NATO SIOP document says, there will be Pushed implants and chips.
[03:08:58.742 --> 03:09:04.785]  There will be nanotech type injections and so forth that will be pushed.
[03:09:05.185 --> 03:09:25.495]   The UK Ministry of Defense document that came out a few years ago, the document about transhumanism, it said that we will have to change global ethics through social engineering so that people no longer object to having Nanotechnology and implementation of various forms of microchipping.
[03:09:25.715 --> 03:09:27.855]  It's not microchips in the classical sense anymore.
[03:09:27.915 --> 03:09:28.876]  It's more like nanotech.
[03:09:29.656 --> 03:09:30.776]  So that people accept that.
[03:09:31.556 --> 03:09:34.357]  So you have all of these white paper documents that are coming out.
[03:09:34.477 --> 03:09:35.277]  They're all public.
[03:09:35.337 --> 03:09:37.177]  They get declassified or they get released.
[03:09:38.317 --> 03:09:45.199]  And yeah, the NATO Cognitive Warfare document is a perfect... It says the exact same thing as the UK Ministry of Defence Transhumanist document.
[03:09:45.839 --> 03:09:46.839]  They say the exact same thing.
[03:09:48.260 --> 03:09:54.162]  We're going to have to not just change your mind, but change your genetics.
[03:09:54.463 --> 03:09:59.625]  And there we have Financial Times putting out an article saying, yes, of course the public is the target of PSYOPs.
[03:10:00.245 --> 03:10:02.986]  Thank you for finally admitting what we were saying for so long.
[03:10:03.006 --> 03:10:06.888]  And by the way, if you don't like PSYOPs, you're a bigot.
[03:10:08.268 --> 03:10:10.969]  It doesn't exist, but when it does exist, it's a great thing.
[03:10:10.989 --> 03:10:12.070]  And if you don't like it, you're a bigot.
[03:10:12.336 --> 03:10:14.896]   I'm going to support my work. You can go to my website and get my book,
[03:10:14.896 --> 03:10:19.856]  660 pages of geopolitics, the red book, signed copies@jaysanalysis.com.
[03:10:19.856 --> 03:10:28.015]  I've not been this excited ever.
[03:10:28.015 --> 03:10:29.015]  [cheering]
[03:10:29.015 --> 03:10:31.015]  Yeah, Mud Club, baby!
[03:10:31.848 --> 03:10:34.449]  The replatforming begins now!
[03:10:34.388 --> 03:10:38.388]  Join Mug Club and get one month free with promo code "Alex"
[03:10:38.388 --> 03:10:48.388]   at JonesCrowder.com [Music]
[03:10:48.388 --> 03:10:50.388]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:10:51.382 --> 03:10:53.564]  I personally have to pay my legal bills.
[03:10:53.704 --> 03:10:55.265]  The court has ruled I have to pay for half the bills.
[03:10:55.846 --> 03:10:56.647]  Keep free speech on air.
[03:10:56.987 --> 03:10:57.748]  I don't have any money.
[03:10:58.874 --> 03:11:02.557]  And my back bills of the year are a little over a million dollars.
[03:11:02.617 --> 03:11:03.277]  Sounds like a lot.
[03:11:03.597 --> 03:11:05.479]  Trump's already spent almost 70 million this year alone.
[03:11:05.819 --> 03:11:07.000]  You want us to fight the globalists?
[03:11:07.440 --> 03:11:08.241]  Sounds like big numbers.
[03:11:08.301 --> 03:11:08.961]  It's not, folks.
[03:11:09.482 --> 03:11:10.302]  We need your support.
[03:11:10.722 --> 03:11:11.863]  It's a decision you've got to make.
[03:11:12.564 --> 03:11:14.445]  Buy products at InfoWarsaw.com that enrich your life.
[03:11:14.485 --> 03:11:14.845]  They're great.
[03:11:15.126 --> 03:11:15.846]  That funds free speech.
[03:11:16.266 --> 03:11:18.648]  The judge has said I've got to pay half the legal bills and everything else.
[03:11:18.908 --> 03:11:19.429]  I can't do it.
[03:11:19.889 --> 03:11:23.832]  So this is our chain in the armor, and we'll have to shut down.
[03:11:26.084 --> 03:11:26.644]  Pretty soon.
[03:11:27.265 --> 03:11:29.106]  And then as soon as they're shut down, we'll get all the money.
[03:11:30.047 --> 03:11:31.568]  Once you start this, you can't stop this.
[03:11:33.029 --> 03:11:34.590]  So, I'm firing the bat signal.
[03:11:34.630 --> 03:11:35.711]  I appreciate all your ongoing support.
[03:11:35.951 --> 03:11:37.212]  We're in a major toe-to-toe battle.
[03:11:37.252 --> 03:11:37.953]  Long-term war.
[03:11:38.313 --> 03:11:39.734]  I'm sorry I gotta keep asking for support.
[03:11:40.355 --> 03:11:42.256]  But I'm asking you humbly to keep us on air.
[03:11:43.017 --> 03:11:44.538]  Then go to DefendJones.com.
[03:11:45.138 --> 03:11:46.039]  A give, send, go account.
[03:11:46.119 --> 03:11:47.100]  DefendJones.com.
[03:11:47.520 --> 03:11:48.921]  I appreciate those that donated in the past.
[03:11:49.341 --> 03:11:50.642]  I appreciate everybody that supported the show.
[03:11:50.662 --> 03:11:51.263]  You know who you are.
[03:11:52.401 --> 03:11:54.762]  We've raised like $25,000 in the last couple hours.
[03:11:54.802 --> 03:11:55.563]  That sounds great.
[03:11:55.923 --> 03:11:57.864]  I've got a million dollar problem.
[03:11:58.404 --> 03:11:59.885]  I think in the next month, you're going to come through.
[03:11:59.905 --> 03:12:01.246]  I think we'll raise it.
[03:12:01.366 --> 03:12:09.611]  Unlike selling a million dollars of supplements, and we make $300,000 or $400,000, or we sell water filters, a million dollars of water filters, and we make $200,000.
[03:12:11.012 --> 03:12:12.393]  I'm not complaining.
[03:12:12.413 --> 03:12:13.613]  It's just we don't put a lot of markup in there.
[03:12:13.633 --> 03:12:14.234]  They're high quality.
[03:12:14.874 --> 03:12:15.875]  And we give you the best deals.
[03:12:16.415 --> 03:12:17.375]  This is how my brain works.
[03:12:17.396 --> 03:12:19.757]  People say, I just have bigger markup.
[03:12:19.777 --> 03:12:20.437]  You don't have any problems.
[03:12:20.497 --> 03:12:21.378]  I just, I can't do it.
[03:12:22.867 --> 03:12:26.388]  But I'm separate from the free speech bankruptcy, and I'm out of money.
[03:12:27.169 --> 03:12:28.849]  And we're actually winning these cases, as you see.
[03:12:28.889 --> 03:12:29.730]  They're really freaked out.
[03:12:30.490 --> 03:12:32.311]  So, I need your support.
[03:12:32.551 --> 03:12:33.471]  It's a long-term fight.
[03:12:33.511 --> 03:12:34.251]  We've fought so long.
[03:12:34.271 --> 03:12:35.832]  You can decide whether you want to give up or not.
[03:12:36.212 --> 03:12:37.573]  I know you don't want to, most of you.
[03:12:38.933 --> 03:12:40.394]  But I wanted to read some of the great comments.
[03:12:40.414 --> 03:12:42.114]  We've had some big donations, small donations.
[03:12:42.134 --> 03:12:45.476]  They're all wonderful, and we appreciate you at DefendJones.com.
[03:12:46.596 --> 03:12:48.877]  Anonymously, privately, you can give, or you can comment if you want.
[03:12:49.961 --> 03:12:50.922]  This is an anonymous donor.
[03:12:51.322 --> 03:12:52.803]  One minute to go.
[03:12:52.823 --> 03:12:52.803]  $50.
[03:12:52.903 --> 03:12:54.304]  Bless you, Alex M. Forrest.
[03:12:54.344 --> 03:12:54.904]  Bless you, too.
[03:12:55.665 --> 03:12:57.546]  Taylor gave $30.
[03:12:58.146 --> 03:13:02.229]  I am going broke, but the dollar won't be around much longer anyways.
[03:13:02.289 --> 03:13:02.949]  Exactly, folks.
[03:13:02.969 --> 03:13:04.270]  You've got to put money in to win.
[03:13:04.790 --> 03:13:07.612]  Hope to see lots of engagement with this fund.
[03:13:07.972 --> 03:13:08.612]  We'll stay on air.
[03:13:08.652 --> 03:13:09.273]  That's what will happen.
[03:13:10.313 --> 03:13:11.014]  Anonymous donor.
[03:13:12.633 --> 03:13:13.935]  $50.
[03:13:12.694 --> 03:13:13.935]  Thank you for your work.
[03:13:13.995 --> 03:13:14.435]  Thank you.
[03:13:14.795 --> 03:13:15.696]  Ralph from Ohio.
[03:13:15.716 --> 03:13:15.696]  $10.
[03:13:16.116 --> 03:13:17.477]  Listening to Infowars 20 years.
[03:13:18.138 --> 03:13:21.361]  95% correct accuracy rate of geopolitical diagnosis and cure rate.
[03:13:23.002 --> 03:13:24.843]  Vincent.
[03:13:25.184 --> 03:13:24.843]  $250.
[03:13:25.744 --> 03:13:26.084]  Thank you.
[03:13:26.565 --> 03:13:32.410]  Alex, you woke me up in the early 2000s with 9-11 road to tyranny, and I've been a regular listener and contributor since 2007.
[03:13:32.450 --> 03:13:32.790]  Thank you.
[03:13:32.810 --> 03:13:33.431]  You're the Infowar.
[03:13:33.871 --> 03:13:35.933]  I'm praying for you and President Trump on a regular basis.
[03:13:36.353 --> 03:13:39.656]  Stay strong, and thank you for doing what you're doing, brother.
[03:13:39.676 --> 03:13:40.076]  Vincent.
[03:13:40.116 --> 03:13:40.757]  Thank you, Vincent.
[03:13:41.696 --> 03:13:43.077]  Karma, $3,000.
[03:13:43.717 --> 03:13:44.258]  Woo!
[03:13:47.860 --> 03:13:49.161]  Opposition in all things.
[03:13:50.102 --> 03:13:51.423]  Anonymous, $1,000.
[03:13:51.463 --> 03:13:52.123]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:13:52.163 --> 03:13:53.184]  No, thank you, Anonymous.
[03:13:53.224 --> 03:13:53.944]  Thank you, Karma.
[03:13:54.285 --> 03:13:54.685]  Jesus.
[03:13:55.505 --> 03:13:56.746]  We love you, Alex and crew.
[03:13:58.587 --> 03:14:00.549]  God's continuing blessing upon you and yours.
[03:14:01.890 --> 03:14:02.970]  Mike Linnum, $1,000.
[03:14:03.231 --> 03:14:03.731]  Thank you, Mike.
[03:14:05.689 --> 03:14:06.789]  Anonymous donor, $10.
[03:14:06.829 --> 03:14:10.270]  The Bible says, if God is for me, who can be against me in the fight?
[03:14:11.030 --> 03:14:15.571]  And with Jesus by your side, darkness, fighting darkness, you'll prevail.
[03:14:16.131 --> 03:14:20.252]  The kingdom of darkness doesn't stand a chance because we already have the victory.
[03:14:20.512 --> 03:14:23.953]  My prayers go with you, Alex, and may the Holy Spirit give you peace.
[03:14:23.993 --> 03:14:24.333]  Thank you.
[03:14:24.413 --> 03:14:24.733]  Amen.
[03:14:25.193 --> 03:14:26.174]  That's just some of the comments.
[03:14:26.194 --> 03:14:26.834]  Thank you so much.
[03:14:26.874 --> 03:14:27.534]  That means so much.
[03:14:28.510 --> 03:14:31.936]  Please go to DefendJones.com and if you want to keep me in the fight, it's your decision.
[03:14:31.956 --> 03:14:32.737]  I'm not saying you should.
[03:14:32.757 --> 03:14:33.599]  I'm not trying to make you do it.
[03:14:33.839 --> 03:14:35.722]  Keep this dog in the fight and donate now.
[03:14:35.923 --> 03:14:36.904]  Action is victory.
[03:14:37.025 --> 03:14:38.046]  Resistance is victory.
[03:14:38.247 --> 03:14:39.208]  It is in your court.
[03:14:39.329 --> 03:14:42.173]  It is your decision whether to pull the plug on this operation or not.
