[00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:27.150]  We have, in our face, the big tech, intelligence agency, think tank, PR firm, combines, working feverishly, around the clock, to manipulate elections, and to put out false information, and to censor populist candidates, and to promote riots at key points.
[00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.931]  That's in the news.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:39.227]  That Big Tech allowed people to promote violence in Brazil, but we have footage and photos of the peaceful protesters stopping the violent protesters and handing them over to the police.
[00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:54.298]  But despite that, it's being blamed, just like January 6th, Ray Epps 2.0, on Bolsonaro, who was president up until three days ago, four days ago, and who told people to not be violent.
[00:00:55.256 --> 00:00:57.397]  And the whole time he was president, they were not violent.
[00:00:57.437 --> 00:01:09.623]  But as soon as Lula gets in, they have only a few police guarding the Capitol, and then provocateurs break in.
[00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:22.490]  If you're a TV viewer, they were just showing some footage of Bolsonaro at a Publix grocery store, casually shopping with his family outside Orlando.
[00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:43.616]  And we have the Democratic Party leadership, right down to AOC, saying that they want him extradited, even though he's not been charged with crimes, for the riots that are ongoing in the capital city of Brazil.
[00:01:48.464 --> 00:01:50.125]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:50.586]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:01:51.586 --> 00:01:51.907]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:53.167]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:01:54.168 --> 00:01:54.488]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:59.248]  [Music]
[00:01:59.248 --> 00:02:09.248]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:02:03.535 --> 00:02:04.115]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:02:05.176 --> 00:02:05.496]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:02:07.058 --> 00:02:07.538]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:09.960]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.141]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:12.442]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:02:13.863 --> 00:02:14.563]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:02:15.604 --> 00:02:16.024]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:22.956]   It's STF
[00:02:22.956 --> 00:02:46.596]   What you are witnessing are scenes in the last 24 hours that have now intensified
[00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:51.155]   in the capital city of Brazil No.
[00:02:51.155 --> 00:02:53.156]  [crowd noise]
[00:02:52.739 --> 00:03:06.667]  Millions, millions of people traveled to the remote capital city well in the interior of the nation, one of those modern cities literally built out of nothing to be their capital in the 1960s.
[00:03:07.248 --> 00:03:16.874]  Millions have traveled there, and millions have now taken over the entire government complex area, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:17.674 --> 00:03:22.197]   Now, obviously, There's a lot of different working parts to this.
[00:03:22.277 --> 00:03:23.038]  Is this January 6, 2.0?
[00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:26.144]  Is this REAPS 2.0?
[00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:29.149]  Or is it something a little different?
[00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.491]  In fact, it's a lot different.
[00:03:31.153 --> 00:03:33.316]  There are a lot of working parts here.
[00:03:35.526 --> 00:03:39.609]  But I've been watching Brazil very, very closely for years, but also particularly with Bolsonaro.
[00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.992]  I was invited down there by his son, who was also a member of their Congress.
[00:03:44.813 --> 00:03:47.595]  I did not go for security reasons.
[00:03:48.636 --> 00:03:53.439]  Bolsonaro, two days before his term ended, traveled to Florida.
[00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.741]  He's living in a suburb of Orlando.
[00:03:55.841 --> 00:04:02.146]  The left is calling for him to be extradited for crimes he's not even been charged with yet from the United States by Joe Biden.
[00:04:03.646 --> 00:04:06.609]  The Communist Lula can throw him in irons.
[00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:12.395]  So we're going to be unpacking all of this when we come back in the next segment, but here's the bottom line.
[00:04:13.696 --> 00:04:22.325]  Obviously, when you watch the raw videos, they had a few dozen police out front guarding the government buildings, the Capitol, the Presidential Palace.
[00:04:23.946 --> 00:04:26.488]  And they had them basically stand down.
[00:04:26.868 --> 00:04:32.092]  You'd have cops 10, 15 feet apart with a million people coming at you who were just protesting.
[00:04:32.532 --> 00:04:41.098]  It'd be very easy for provocateurs to force their way through dressed up in the yellow and green of the nation, also the colors of Bolsonaro's party.
[00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:43.600]  Many of them also were wearing American flags.
[00:04:44.821 --> 00:04:51.866]  Was it provocateured by Lula right after he knew that Bolsonaro had left the country because they were going to arrest Bolsonaro with trumped up charges?
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.241]  Or was there just a giant crowd there that was angry and some were intent on taking the government building?
[00:04:59.462 --> 00:05:03.363]  But just taking some government buildings where they meet to vote does not take a government.
[00:05:03.843 --> 00:05:10.025]  To take a government, you take over the media, you take over the military bases, and you need the military on your side up front.
[00:05:11.925 --> 00:05:38.070]   It's too soon to tell what's happening, but now, ladies and gentlemen, the military in the capital city of Brazil, Brasilia, They are siding with the population and are blocking the police, who are backed by the paramilitary communists, from attacking the protesters who have taken over the government buildings.
[00:05:39.522 --> 00:05:57.080]  So yes, if on January 6th we would have come with guns and taken the Capitol and also taken over media outlets and the rest of it and gone on TV and said this is an illegitimate government and the rest of it and said Joe Biden's a criminal, that would have been an actual insurrection and a coup.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.642]  And by the way, I would not have supported that.
[00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:10.647]  But having a million of us there to say we're protesting an election, and have provocateurs break in, have the police then wave everybody in, that was a setup and a staged event, and Graham's admitted he quote, orchestrated it.
[00:06:11.348 --> 00:06:12.228]  So it's all admitted now.
[00:06:12.268 --> 00:06:16.291]  January 6th committee has it on record under oath, the confession.
[00:06:17.112 --> 00:06:18.733]  This is a little different so far.
[00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:21.916]  We're going to see how this unfolds, but all hell is breaking loose.
[00:06:22.136 --> 00:06:24.638]  There's also huge, biggest yet Russia news.
[00:06:25.658 --> 00:06:37.884]  It's Monday, January 9th, 2023, and InfoWars is still on air, still defiant to the globalist worldwide coup of surveillance and censorship and control.
[00:06:37.924 --> 00:06:43.127]  We're extremely honored to be here, and salute and thank you all for your support, your prayers, and your word of mouth.
[00:06:43.367 --> 00:06:48.710]  Because without the viewers and listeners, this broadcast would not exist, and the credit all goes to you.
[00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:55.893]  When it comes to credit to human beings on this planet and the crew, but at the end of the day, it all goes to God and God's will.
[00:06:56.133 --> 00:06:58.254]  But God works through us, through our free will.
[00:06:58.274 --> 00:07:01.275]  All right, let me tell you what's coming up today.
[00:07:01.475 --> 00:07:01.815]  Wow!
[00:07:03.396 --> 00:07:08.478]  The population has taken over the government centers in the capital city of Brazil.
[00:07:09.821 --> 00:07:12.103]  The military is now siding with the population.
[00:07:13.024 --> 00:07:15.106]  This is a lot different than January 6th.
[00:07:15.146 --> 00:07:16.667]  This is a powder keg.
[00:07:17.308 --> 00:07:24.134]  Bolsonaro has traveled because Lula was going to arrest him on trumped up charges that haven't been filed yet to Florida.
[00:07:24.154 --> 00:07:28.497]  We're going to be hitting all of that coming up here in just a moment.
[00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:34.603]  Then, news quite frankly that's even bigger.
[00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:39.641]  We are facing the entire NATO and Ukraine, Kremlin says, as U.S.
[00:07:40.242 --> 00:07:41.463]  mulls battle tanks.
[00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:52.510]  They're already shipping armored personnel carriers and Bradley fighting vehicles, so are the Germans, the French, everybody else, dumping hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of armored personnel carriers and light tanks in.
[00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.992]  They say the first of thousands that will be dumped into the country.
[00:07:56.492 --> 00:08:02.156]  Over $160 billion has already been given to them since February last year, in the last 11 months.
[00:08:06.158 --> 00:08:09.359]  So this is absolutely out of control.
[00:08:10.579 --> 00:08:19.441]  When you study military affairs, and I don't mean running around with machine guns and doing infantry formations, that's on the ground.
[00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:29.623]  When you study military history and war, and how it starts, there is always a threat ladder you go up.
[00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:33.471]  And the Pentagon has a threat ladder that goes up into the low 40s.
[00:08:34.132 --> 00:08:40.216]  And we're well into the mid-20s right now of when you end with total destruction of the planet with thermonuclear weapons.
[00:08:41.197 --> 00:08:49.243]  And we're following that exact reincorporation Pentagon line that they're actually using in their operation against Russia.
[00:08:50.143 --> 00:08:54.086]  So you can be for Russia, you can be for the US, you can be for Ukraine, you can be for wherever you want.
[00:08:54.106 --> 00:09:06.505]   At the end of the day, the globalists Are driving this, and we the people, whether we're American, or French, or Russian, or Mexican, or Japanese, or South African, we're all paying for it, and we can all be destroyed by it.
[00:09:06.885 --> 00:09:10.468]  So, that is coming up, and it's a huge, huge deal.
[00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:25.099]  Then, we've got a lot of the aftermath of the speakership fight last week, and a lot of listeners and viewers want to know my views on that, and what I think is really going on, and I know exactly what's going on.
[00:09:27.837 --> 00:09:37.627]  And it's not been determined exactly what's going to unfold, but if you want an expert breakdown, I will humbly say I'm going to engage in that as well.
[00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:43.033]  And of course, we have many other bombshell bombshell bombshells.
[00:09:45.075 --> 00:09:46.537]  We need to do a FOIA request.
[00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:58.339]  Because obviously, I remember watching congressional testimony before we got totally deplatformed five years ago, and they're having Senate and House hearings.
[00:09:58.559 --> 00:09:59.579]  We played the clubs many times.
[00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.760]  In fact, if Rob Dewar can find them, it would be great.
[00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:16.587]   They're specifically talking about Paul Watson, and a Muslim Had screamed Allah Akbar in a stolen truck, 18-wheeler, and had run over a bunch of people in New York City screaming Allah Akbar.
[00:10:17.508 --> 00:10:23.994]  And polls simply linked to witnesses on the ground saying he was screaming Allah Akbar, but the media was covering it up.
[00:10:24.014 --> 00:10:24.994]  It later came out it was true.
[00:10:25.835 --> 00:10:40.221]   And so the senators and House members, in the House case, it was that congressman out of Illinois that's got the Goofy name, it's like Goofy or Doofy or Goofus, Goopus or something.
[00:10:40.821 --> 00:10:42.202]  I'm not joking, he's got a ridiculous name.
[00:10:42.602 --> 00:10:44.522]  It'll pop in my head in a minute, but I just want the crew to find it.
[00:10:46.203 --> 00:11:00.906]  And he's sitting there talking to the head engineer at Twitter, and he goes, today, the number one thing on Twitter is Infowars.com and Paul Joseph Watson with a false report that a Muslim attacked people with a truck.
[00:11:01.706 --> 00:11:03.907]  When we all know it was not a Muslim, the truck did it.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:05.580]  I'm not joking.
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.001]  Remember when the guy in Kenosha ran over all the folks?
[00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:08.901]  They said the truck attacked.
[00:11:08.942 --> 00:11:09.642]  It was the same thing.
[00:11:11.523 --> 00:11:15.964]  And they said, sir, the AI system is going in in six months.
[00:11:16.064 --> 00:11:17.185]  He will be shut down.
[00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:19.746]  And he's like, good.
[00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:22.707]  It better happen.
[00:11:23.187 --> 00:11:24.568]  It better happen soon.
[00:11:25.828 --> 00:11:27.089]  So I knew this was all coming.
[00:11:27.169 --> 00:11:28.269]  I knew we were about to be banned.
[00:11:28.569 --> 00:11:32.851]  They were having Senate and House committee meetings, two separate ones.
[00:11:34.056 --> 00:11:37.357]  That was the one on, I remember the specifics was on Watson, the other one was on another story I was doing.
[00:11:38.037 --> 00:11:44.059]  But the point is, we already know because before the documents ever came out, I was watching the hearings.
[00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:47.200]  Well, here it is.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:12:03.654]   White House lobbied Facebook to censor Tucker Carlson and thousands of others over skepticism towards COVID-19 vaccines, saying two years ago, That evidence was that the shots didn't work, and children didn't need them.
[00:12:04.234 --> 00:12:07.375]  Which is all confirmed, and they knew it back then, but now it's not even debated.
[00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:09.095]  Or that natural immunity is better.
[00:12:10.275 --> 00:12:23.818]  We have a treasure trove of hundreds of emails from the White House, senior staff, to Twitter, saying, we're supposedly in control of your operation.
[00:12:24.178 --> 00:12:27.239]  You supposedly have censorship AI systems, read it.
[00:12:28.217 --> 00:12:32.539]  In place that will stop him from going to number one.
[00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:37.340]  And this is them talking to Facebook and also, you know, it's all the other tech companies, Twitter as well.
[00:12:38.761 --> 00:12:42.662]  But it's exactly what they have been caught doing over and over again.
[00:12:42.802 --> 00:12:54.146]  And imagine what else, via these lawsuits, the Attorney General of Louisiana, the Attorney General of Missouri, who both deposed Fauci a month ago and Fauci couldn't remember anything.
[00:12:56.161 --> 00:12:57.904]  But then he goes and does interviews and remembers everything.
[00:12:59.708 --> 00:13:08.564]  So this is so huge, ladies and gentlemen, and if we have the time today, there's a big article on InfoWars.com, but if we have time, we really, really need to read.
[00:13:10.945 --> 00:13:11.685]  Some of these emails.
[00:13:11.725 --> 00:13:16.647]  I mean, I've just got a stack of 20 or so right here that are just insane.
[00:13:16.767 --> 00:13:18.628]  I mean, we can do the whole next hour on these.
[00:13:18.828 --> 00:13:20.188]  These are just incredible.
[00:13:20.928 --> 00:13:21.949]  And they're threatening them.
[00:13:22.209 --> 00:13:23.749]  Listen, you got AI in charge.
[00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.150]  How the hell is he the number one thing on Facebook right now?
[00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.732]  You say you've got filters that don't let right-wingers of any type ever get popular.
[00:13:31.412 --> 00:13:33.393]  And then they come back and say, we just want his ass banned.
[00:13:34.193 --> 00:13:36.394]  And they're, sir, that's too obvious.
[00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:41.721]  You shoot for the king, you better hit him, as they say.
[00:13:42.962 --> 00:13:43.622]  You better kill him.
[00:13:44.923 --> 00:13:51.187]  So, they had him shadowbanned, but he was so popular that he broke through.
[00:13:51.207 --> 00:13:57.030]  I remember, Tucker four years ago, his nightly show would have 10 million views every night on YouTube.
[00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.751]  Bigger than even what he has on Fox.
[00:13:59.092 --> 00:14:00.652]  It's all down to 500,000 now.
[00:14:00.853 --> 00:14:01.433]  Shadowbanned.
[00:14:01.693 --> 00:14:02.774]  None of the subscribers get it.
[00:14:04.042 --> 00:14:04.902]  Same thing on Twitter.
[00:14:04.922 --> 00:14:06.883]  But still, Carlson breaks through.
[00:14:06.963 --> 00:14:17.824]  And that's what we've got to do with InfoWars, and with everybody else telling the truth, is get the most important pieces, post them different places, put different names on them so the AI doesn't catch it, and get it through on them.
[00:14:18.425 --> 00:14:20.005]  And that's what you've been doing as InfoWars.
[00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:22.065]  You've been doing a really excellent job.
[00:14:22.085 --> 00:14:23.705]  But this is a big, big, big deal.
[00:14:24.066 --> 00:14:25.326]  So I'm going to get to that.
[00:14:27.146 --> 00:14:38.305]   And then Roger Stone joins us in the third hour It's Nixon's 109th birthday, but he's been talking about what happened in Congress and the agenda.
[00:14:38.325 --> 00:14:50.929]  It was Roger that predicted having a slim majority would be better in the House than a big majority, knowing how rhinos and neocons work, that a slim minority of patriots could take full control, like Mnuchin did in the Senate with his vote.
[00:14:51.249 --> 00:14:57.210]  But if they were real patriots, you could have patriot Mnuchins in there that could take control of the House and have a real agenda.
[00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:06.416]   And despite the fact that McCarthy barely pushed it over the top, They just demonstrated how much power they have, and so I would love to have McCarthy gone, but let's make lemonade out of these lemons.
[00:15:06.877 --> 00:15:25.754]  Roger Stone's going to be joining us come up third hour, and then Michael Cargill, the guy that I got my concealed carry from many, many years ago, has a great gun shop and great training school here in Texas, and he sues the government all the time and wins, and he just won, striking down the Trump-era bump stock man.
[00:15:26.314 --> 00:15:29.895]  And there's other lawsuits to stop all these other attacks on semi-autos.
[00:15:30.175 --> 00:15:32.956]  He'll be in studio in the fourth hour.
[00:15:33.056 --> 00:15:34.497]  And more good news from judges.
[00:15:34.937 --> 00:15:39.999]  Judge rules West Virginia law restricting sports by biological sex is constitutional.
[00:15:40.499 --> 00:15:43.360]  There's also been more attacks on the power grid, as we predicted.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.960]  And so much more.
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:49.202]  Biden's Potemkin Village, Truman Show, Visit the Border, and more.
[00:15:50.785 --> 00:15:52.646]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:15:52.986 --> 00:15:56.087]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:15:56.527 --> 00:15:58.128]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:15:58.148 --> 00:15:58.768]  to 3 p.m.
[00:15:58.808 --> 00:15:59.208]  Central.
[00:15:59.528 --> 00:16:00.048]  You found it.
[00:16:00.068 --> 00:16:01.869]  The most censored broadcast in the world.
[00:16:02.169 --> 00:16:03.409]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:16:03.669 --> 00:16:06.150]  Hosted by... Yes, me.
[00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.871]  The man who must not be named.
[00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:10.732]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:11.573 --> 00:16:20.460]  There's a lot of facets and a lot of angles to this Bolsonaro situation, this Brazil crisis, then the latest developments in Ukraine that are off the chart dangerous.
[00:16:21.701 --> 00:16:22.802]  We're going to be hitting that first.
[00:16:23.763 --> 00:16:25.885]  Also, gigantic.
[00:16:26.766 --> 00:16:27.787]  It just gets bigger every day.
[00:16:28.627 --> 00:16:31.250]  New revelations on the poison shots not distributed worldwide.
[00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.712]  There has now been an FDA advisory meeting.
[00:16:34.573 --> 00:16:35.974]  We have video of it being broken down.
[00:16:37.236 --> 00:16:44.400]  FDA in their virtual meeting yesterday, we were falsely misled by Pfizer about the safety of the vaccine.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.623]  Heart attacks are 71 times higher than other vaccines.
[00:16:49.863 --> 00:16:52.525]  Because any vaccine can cause a heart attack and autoimmune response.
[00:16:52.585 --> 00:16:55.967]  The vaccines are killing two people for every one life saved.
[00:16:57.748 --> 00:17:00.049]  We're gonna be getting to that.
[00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.951]  I mean it's just the amount of news is incredible.
[00:17:03.591 --> 00:17:10.481]   But before we go any further, The only way we're able to operate and stay on air is listeners like you buying products at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:17:11.402 --> 00:17:12.962]  I'm very thankful for all your past support.
[00:17:13.002 --> 00:17:25.387]  We got into Catch-22 with supply chain problems and other issues the last few years where we couldn't get enough product to supply the audience with what you wanted that normally gave us enough money to operate in the black in a healthy way.
[00:17:27.667 --> 00:17:35.110]  And we've gotten into Catch-22 where if we had enough X2 and enough X3, you always buy it, you love it, we would not be in the red right now a little bit.
[00:17:35.683 --> 00:17:36.283]  More than a little bit.
[00:17:37.163 --> 00:17:38.644]  More of it's coming in in a couple months.
[00:17:38.664 --> 00:17:39.844]  We're trying to budget the money.
[00:17:40.124 --> 00:17:43.304]  We've almost saved the money to put the 50% down to reorder it.
[00:17:43.864 --> 00:17:45.385]  So we just need to get out of this rut.
[00:17:45.485 --> 00:17:46.385]  We're almost there.
[00:17:46.825 --> 00:17:51.726]  We have about a quarter million dollar deficit, a little under that, the last six months running.
[00:17:52.166 --> 00:17:55.607]  And I've exhausted all my funds to prop M4's up.
[00:17:55.807 --> 00:17:58.047]  I have like $40,000 in the bank now.
[00:17:58.307 --> 00:17:59.287]  Enough to pay my bills, okay?
[00:17:59.387 --> 00:18:09.657]   I mean, and I'm proud of that because, I mean, nothing wrong with having money, but When it going gets tough, keeping the fight going and believing in God and just being completely committed is where we're at.
[00:18:09.677 --> 00:18:11.299]  And we have a plan to stay on air indefinitely.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.103]  That's why we're in a reorganization bankruptcy.
[00:18:15.725 --> 00:18:20.091]  We've got, you know, good news from the court, but we've got to stay in the black, if just a little.
[00:18:21.104 --> 00:18:21.924]  And it's easy to do.
[00:18:21.944 --> 00:18:25.045]  You just go to InfoWareStore.com and get the great products we do have.
[00:18:25.425 --> 00:18:26.345]  But again, it's a Catch-22.
[00:18:27.265 --> 00:18:33.727]  We are down to a couple thousand bottles of DNA Force and a couple thousand bottles of Vitamineral Fusion or canisters.
[00:18:36.108 --> 00:18:42.209]  If we had enough of this, we'd have plenty of funds, but we're not going to know when we're going to have money to order more of it.
[00:18:43.519 --> 00:18:51.801]  I've got a few things going on where it looks like we've got some sponsors coming on board and a few other things, and I'll just take the sponsorship money and buy the products to be able to continue on in the future.
[00:18:52.201 --> 00:19:01.844]  Everything we're selling, we have in stock, but it'll be months and months until more Vitamin Mineral Fusion and DNA Force Plus, two key amazing products for your whole body, your cells, your telomeres, your DNA.
[00:19:02.404 --> 00:19:06.925]  It is just what the doctor ordered in the types of attacks and crises we're all under.
[00:19:07.545 --> 00:19:10.166]  So I told everybody, we're going to have to end this sale today.
[00:19:11.872 --> 00:19:12.814]  Well, we're in a cash 22.
[00:19:12.854 --> 00:19:15.239]  We need the funds, even though it's going to sell out.
[00:19:15.679 --> 00:19:19.026]  It'd be better to have it go back to full price, sell what we've got left in the next few months.
[00:19:19.447 --> 00:19:20.609]  But we need the funds right now.
[00:19:20.729 --> 00:19:22.152]  So I'm going to keep them at 50% off.
[00:19:23.863 --> 00:19:27.186]  Until tomorrow night and then that's it.
[00:19:27.206 --> 00:19:35.234]  100% Vitamineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus will go to full price instead of 50% off tomorrow night at midnight and that's it.
[00:19:35.535 --> 00:19:36.796]  You need Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:19:36.856 --> 00:19:37.977]  You need DNA Force Plus.
[00:19:37.997 --> 00:19:47.507]  They're incredible products and you're not going to get any product close to this good for your body and the great organic ingredients it has that you're going to get with DNA Force Plus and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.302]  So please go there and take care of yourself, take care of your family, and keep the broadcast on the air.
[00:19:53.482 --> 00:19:54.022]  Separately.
[00:19:55.102 --> 00:19:56.303]  Sold out for five months.
[00:19:57.023 --> 00:19:58.864]  It's the strongest sleep aid we've got.
[00:19:59.944 --> 00:20:00.745]  Knockout's great.
[00:20:01.605 --> 00:20:02.485]  Rocket rest is great.
[00:20:02.865 --> 00:20:03.726]  That's my dad's product.
[00:20:04.006 --> 00:20:05.746]  But down and out is way stronger than both.
[00:20:05.766 --> 00:20:07.147]  In fact, too strong for some people.
[00:20:07.467 --> 00:20:12.789]  When I tell you folks, be careful with this, people go, my God, I took a whole dropper full and couldn't get out of bed for 14 hours.
[00:20:13.009 --> 00:20:13.629]  Listen to me.
[00:20:13.709 --> 00:20:14.730]  This is real, okay?
[00:20:15.683 --> 00:20:17.464]  Big dose of high quality melatonin.
[00:20:17.845 --> 00:20:20.147]  Big dose of valerian root.
[00:20:22.028 --> 00:20:27.372]  Liquid pressed, organically based, super high quality, only take a few drops the first time.
[00:20:27.773 --> 00:20:28.073]  Okay?
[00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:32.937]  Because we get calls from the customer service line, my god, that stuff's incredibly strong, why didn't you tell me?
[00:20:32.997 --> 00:20:33.738]  We did tell you.
[00:20:34.038 --> 00:20:35.259]  But we're not selling crap.
[00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:39.202]  If you've never taken a natural sleep aid, why don't you take Knockout first?
[00:20:39.262 --> 00:20:52.671]   It's got eight different great ingredients, it's strong, but it's like, Lloyd Waymether punching you versus Mike Tyson.
[00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:55.432]  One of them is a lightweight, still knocked your head off.
[00:20:56.033 --> 00:20:57.293]  One of them is a heavyweight champion.
[00:20:57.934 --> 00:21:05.658]  So if you want Down and Out, it's back in stock for 50% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:07.278]  Down and Out, back in stock.
[00:21:07.298 --> 00:21:08.319]  We've got a big shipment of it.
[00:21:08.739 --> 00:21:10.180]  Now here's the good news and here's the bad news.
[00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:15.886]  Real Red Bill Plus has been sold out for over two years because we couldn't get the proprietary ingredients.
[00:21:15.906 --> 00:21:17.108]  We weren't going to cut the quality.
[00:21:17.128 --> 00:21:19.070]  It's got Preglanone, everything else in it.
[00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:26.939]  This is a very special proprietary that a very well-known medical scientist helped us develop.
[00:21:28.103 --> 00:21:30.964]  Basically a souped up version of what's already sold in medical clinics.
[00:21:31.304 --> 00:21:32.264]  This is the fountain of youth.
[00:21:32.644 --> 00:21:33.905]  It's got everything in it you need.
[00:21:34.125 --> 00:21:37.426]  Trace elements, vitamins, minerals, preglanone, a bunch of other compounds.
[00:21:38.686 --> 00:21:41.767]  Preglanone is not produced in the body at the levels it should be after 40.
[00:21:42.287 --> 00:21:45.768]  You have to have preglanone to produce the normal hormones you're supposed to have.
[00:21:46.568 --> 00:21:48.188]  This is a really powerful formula.
[00:21:48.268 --> 00:21:49.069]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:21:49.569 --> 00:21:52.650]  The good news is it's been a best seller since it came back in three weeks ago.
[00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:56.771]  The bad news is that we got a limited order in.
[00:21:57.833 --> 00:22:00.874]  So at current sales rates, it's going to be sold out in two weeks.
[00:22:01.754 --> 00:22:05.635]  Despite that, despite the fact that's happening, we need all the funds we can get now.
[00:22:07.536 --> 00:22:10.097]  And then hopefully we'll get more in a few months if we get the funds.
[00:22:10.617 --> 00:22:17.719]  But if you want real Red Pill Plus right now, here is your chance to get it at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:17.779 --> 00:22:18.199]  Experience it.
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.700]  Keep the show on the air.
[00:22:24.215 --> 00:22:25.315]  And I thank you for your support.
[00:22:25.335 --> 00:22:29.356]  If you want to make a straight donation on the front of Infowarshore.com, there's a big red banner with a bullhorn.
[00:22:29.556 --> 00:22:33.537]  Make a $5, $10 one-time donation, $20 or a recurring donation.
[00:22:33.577 --> 00:22:34.357]  Cancel any time.
[00:22:34.777 --> 00:22:35.977]  Please keep us on air.
[00:22:36.217 --> 00:22:40.198]  There isn't an organization more effective at exposing the New World Order's master plan.
[00:22:40.438 --> 00:22:41.278]  All right, I'm done plugging.
[00:22:45.099 --> 00:22:46.379]  We're still a few minutes out from break.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:58.701]   But I don't want to start now on Brazil that is so huge, until we come back, because I've got to really knock this out of the park and cover every facet, and I will in the next 10-minute segment.
[00:22:59.161 --> 00:23:16.653]  Because this affects us and the same globalists that have hijacked our Congress to a great extent, and have stolen the presidency, have done the same thing around the world, and they're running their same playbook they ran against America two years ago, two years and two months ago, against Bolsonaro.
[00:23:17.984 --> 00:23:22.888]  And it looks like it's backfiring and this ball is up in the air right now.
[00:23:23.248 --> 00:23:25.410]  So this is a big, big deal.
[00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:35.237]  We're going to nail that and then we're going to tie it in next segment on what really happened last week in Congress and the inside baseball there.
[00:23:35.318 --> 00:23:40.562]  And then I'm going to stop talking about that until Roger Stone joins us to get into it more depth in the third hour.
[00:23:41.242 --> 00:23:52.189]   Then when I start The second hour, we're going to get into the Russia situation and NATO basically officially going to war and escalating up that threat ladder with the armored vehicles and tanks.
[00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:53.770]  Now they're talking about heavy tanks.
[00:23:55.471 --> 00:23:59.234]  And then we're also going to look at the Potemkin Village visit.
[00:24:00.014 --> 00:24:00.815]  We don't know what that is.
[00:24:00.835 --> 00:24:01.615]  We're going to break it down.
[00:24:01.655 --> 00:24:06.719]  But it was a Potemkin Village visit to the border by Joe Biden, who basically did a touch and go.
[00:24:07.883 --> 00:24:12.883]   in his aircraft and then took off down to Mexico to get them to sign on to the carbon taxes of the New World Order.
[00:24:12.883 --> 00:24:19.883]   So that's all coming up as well. And then again, as I mentioned, we got to spend some time on the emails released
[00:24:19.883 --> 00:24:24.803]   from the White House from the White House via the Attorney General that sued
[00:24:24.803 --> 00:24:31.883]   Facebook and Big Tech and got the documents that the White House was and is running the censorship.
[00:24:31.883 --> 00:24:40.422]   There is no doubt the evidence is overwhelming and it's on record that we have a global corporate criminal coup taking
[00:24:40.422 --> 00:24:44.883]  place against populist free peoples across the world.
[00:24:44.883 --> 00:24:54.883]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:24:46.279 --> 00:24:56.709]  From Europe, to the UK, to Canada, to the United States, to South America and places like Brazil, to places all over Africa, to the Caribbean and Haiti.
[00:24:59.306 --> 00:25:26.044]  We have, in our face, the big tech, intelligence agency, think tank, PR firm, combines, working feverishly, around the clock, to manipulate elections, and to put out false information, and to censor populist candidates, and to promote riots at key points.
[00:25:26.104 --> 00:25:26.825]  That's in the news.
[00:25:28.291 --> 00:25:38.117]  That Big Tech allowed people to promote violence in Brazil, but we have footage and photos of the peaceful protesters stopping the violent protesters and handing them over to the police.
[00:25:38.578 --> 00:25:53.207]  But despite that, it's being blamed, just like January 6, Ray Epps 2.0, on Bolsonaro, who was president up until three days ago, four days ago, and who told people do not be violent.
[00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:56.291]  And the whole time he was president, they were not violent.
[00:25:56.331 --> 00:26:08.536]  But as soon as Lula gets in, they have only a few police guarding the Capitol, and then provocateurs break in.
[00:26:09.336 --> 00:26:21.381]  If you're a TV viewer, they were just showing some footage of Bolsonaro at a Publix grocery store, casually shopping with his family outside Orlando.
[00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:42.679]  And we have the Democratic Party leadership, right down to AOC, saying that they want him extradited, even though he's not been charged with crimes, for the riots that are ongoing in the capital city of Brazil.
[00:26:43.339 --> 00:26:48.162]  And just like January 6th, they're calling it an insurrection, they're calling it criminal.
[00:26:49.426 --> 00:27:28.029]   And it began when the million or so protesters showed up to the flimsy barricades, and you see a few police, like a dozen, just like January 6, spray the crowd with pepper spray, enraging them, and then an angry crowd, some of the provocateurs, it's now been confirmed, begin to break through, And then once the Capitol and the Presidential Palace, as it's called, had been broken into by a few thousand people, hundreds of thousands then poured into the complex.
[00:27:30.971 --> 00:27:37.097]  And again, if you're a radio listener, we're showing you all of this at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:27:37.177 --> 00:27:40.180]  The broadcast is a simulcast of radio on television.
[00:27:42.369 --> 00:27:44.710]  So we can document everything we're saying and breaking down.
[00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:48.571]  I was not the first to simulcast radio on TV.
[00:27:48.672 --> 00:27:49.432]  I was the second.
[00:27:49.452 --> 00:27:54.134]  It was Don Imus that first did it, and I've been doing it since 1997.
[00:27:55.934 --> 00:28:09.780]  Other people will have webcams or occasionally go live, but we've been doing it since 97 because I like to document everything we're talking about and have it on record instead of me just being a talk show host telling you that this or that happened.
[00:28:12.438 --> 00:28:15.880]  Now, let's look at the angles of this.
[00:28:17.481 --> 00:28:44.185]   I don't know if this was purely provocateured, but I know the State Department is on record with Big Tech manipulating that election, and there was the same telltale signs of election fraud in Brazil, where he won every other town and city and jurisdiction, county, region, except The one most populous city that the communists control.
[00:28:47.868 --> 00:28:50.871]  And we know they control the Supreme Court, the communists do.
[00:28:50.891 --> 00:28:57.997]  And the State Department admits they were down there with Big Tech, engaged in massive election meddling.
[00:28:59.144 --> 00:29:14.368]  And we've had computer scientists and others testify to Congress, top statisticians, how Google alone, not letting people get to candidate info, putting out false info, promoting 99% pro-Democrat information, has a 10 to 30 point swing for Democrats.
[00:29:14.708 --> 00:29:21.310]  So electronically that way, with AI systems, they're stealing and swaying elections.
[00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:35.988]   Then by censoring, not just the Hunter Biden laptop, but the open border news and the Afghan withdrawal news and all the rest of the criminal news of the Democrats, that also steals elections.
[00:29:36.028 --> 00:29:38.469]  That's also election meddling.
[00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:51.317]  Everything they claimed Russia was doing, with zero evidence, they have now done to the American people, and the people running this combine are multinationalists and are against the United States of America.
[00:29:52.738 --> 00:29:53.699]  So we know they stole.
[00:29:55.134 --> 00:30:10.147]  The last two elections here, we know they stole the Brazilian election, and we know Bolsonaro had the military on his side, and it's in their constitution, that there's a stalemate between the executive and the judiciary, that the military can intervene and call for new elections.
[00:30:11.068 --> 00:30:13.610]  Bolsonaro did not even do that.
[00:30:16.092 --> 00:30:17.574]  And he then called for peace.
[00:30:18.826 --> 00:30:31.029]  And left the country because he knew he couldn't control the outcome and it might get hundreds of thousands if not millions killed even though it would have probably been just in many people's eyes for him to go ahead and take control of the government.
[00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:40.772]  But the country is too split even though the majority want capitalism and are pro-America and are pro-Trump and are really awake.
[00:30:42.412 --> 00:30:44.253]  Bolsonaro made the decision to call for peace.
[00:30:46.107 --> 00:30:50.369]  And he said that Lula was illegitimate, but that they had to find other ways to fix it.
[00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:55.092]  And then he left the country and moved to Florida.
[00:30:56.412 --> 00:30:58.573]  Now they're blaming him for what's happened.
[00:30:58.593 --> 00:31:17.911]   But the military, and we're showing footage of this now, the military Has been siding with their tanks and the troops, and has been blocking the police, the riot police, who have machine guns and tear gas, from attacking the peaceful crowds.
[00:31:18.611 --> 00:31:22.574]  And that's the right thing to do, because the crowds are predominantly peaceful.
[00:31:23.094 --> 00:31:28.778]  Mostly peaceful, as the Democrats would say, when Democrats burned down half the country, or two billion dollars of buildings or more.
[00:31:30.099 --> 00:31:38.539]   But history and psychology shows, if they just pull the troops and military back, In a couple days, if not a week, people will just go home.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.042]  But Lula has been trying to order the military and police to shoot and attack the crowds.
[00:31:45.062 --> 00:31:47.743]  They've already shot and killed some people and arrested thousands.
[00:31:48.383 --> 00:31:52.885]  So they want a big explosion to destabilize the country as an excuse for them to get full control.
[00:31:53.445 --> 00:31:55.866]  The military is wisely trying to just stand down.
[00:31:56.306 --> 00:32:01.808]  All this dissipates and stops because you don't capture a country by taking over empty buildings where people vote.
[00:32:02.463 --> 00:32:10.288]  You capture a country by taking over the military and by taking over the media and then by arresting your political opposition.
[00:32:10.649 --> 00:32:12.630]  Something Lula has said he would do.
[00:32:17.093 --> 00:32:21.696]  Something Lula has said he would do once he got control.
[00:32:22.176 --> 00:32:23.758]  So Bolsonaro had to leave the country.
[00:32:24.178 --> 00:32:27.220]  And I would expect to see Bolsonaro pop up on Tucker Carlson's show.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.443]  I would expect to see him very, very soon on US television.
[00:32:32.691 --> 00:32:34.453]  Just give me a little bit of inside baseball there.
[00:32:36.315 --> 00:32:38.338]  So, how is this going to end?
[00:32:38.578 --> 00:32:41.822]  I don't know, but Lula is illegitimate.
[00:32:41.842 --> 00:32:43.344]  The majority of the public doesn't want him.
[00:32:43.882 --> 00:32:49.322]   and they have now occupied the Capitol buildings, and if they stupidly continue to kill people,
[00:32:49.322 --> 00:32:53.882]   it's going to force the military to not just be a buffer, but to actually turn against the new
[00:32:53.882 --> 00:33:00.201]   illegitimate government and demand new elections, at which point Bolsonaro would return, they would
[00:33:00.201 --> 00:33:05.642]   have a second round of elections. But I don't know if that's going to be happening.
[00:33:05.831 --> 00:33:15.056]  But again, the very same globalists that ran the takeover of Brazil and have run the takeover in other countries, they are now clearly, admittedly running this.
[00:33:15.556 --> 00:33:18.778]  And it shows how the globalists are meddling inside countries.
[00:33:19.498 --> 00:33:21.199]  Bolsonaro condemns vandalism.
[00:33:21.239 --> 00:33:27.263]  Five shot, 1,200 arrested as protesters disarm provocateurs and hand them over to police.
[00:33:27.783 --> 00:33:28.683]  Communist clampdown.
[00:33:28.744 --> 00:33:32.826]  Lula regime sends in buses to take thousands of opposition protesters to prison.
[00:33:34.352 --> 00:33:36.794]  Morales blocked 200 Facebook profiles.
[00:33:36.834 --> 00:33:40.737]  Hotels ordered to turn over their guest list, just like we saw on January 6th.
[00:33:41.738 --> 00:33:42.798]  And so much more.
[00:33:43.199 --> 00:33:46.361]  We'll cover it all straight ahead and what happened last week in Congress.
[00:33:48.042 --> 00:33:53.887]  ...at that end to put it all through and just all the different members and hanging with me through all those different votes.
[00:33:54.767 --> 00:33:58.010]  But I do want to especially thank President Trump.
[00:33:59.051 --> 00:34:01.673]  I don't think anybody should doubt his influence.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.800]  He was with me from the beginning.
[00:34:04.401 --> 00:34:07.581]  Somebody wrote the doubt of whether he was there, and he was all in.
[00:34:08.062 --> 00:34:09.602]  He would call me and he would call others.
[00:34:10.482 --> 00:34:16.004]  And he really was, I was just talking to him tonight, helping get those final votes.
[00:34:16.824 --> 00:34:21.506]  What he's really saying, really, for the party and the country, that we have to come together.
[00:34:22.306 --> 00:34:23.926]  We have to focus on the economy.
[00:34:23.946 --> 00:34:25.927]  We've got to focus, make our borders secure.
[00:34:27.347 --> 00:34:31.369]  We gotta do so much work to do, and he was a great influence to make that all happen.
[00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:35.150]  So, thank you President Trump.
[00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:40.192]  Alright, so everybody mad at MTG and even Matt Gaetz for switching his vote at the last minute last Friday night.
[00:34:41.733 --> 00:34:44.194]  I mean, Trump asked him to do that.
[00:34:44.554 --> 00:34:45.595]  So, you gotta be mad at Trump.
[00:34:45.995 --> 00:34:49.596]  I'll tell you what I really think about this in a moment, here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:49.616 --> 00:34:55.098]  But first, Brazil's Bolsonaro, that just broke, hospitalized in the U.S.
[00:34:55.118 --> 00:34:56.199]  with abdominal pain.
[00:34:59.261 --> 00:35:04.465]  Former Brazilian President was admitted to a hospital in Orlando, Florida with abdominal pains.
[00:35:05.146 --> 00:35:12.831]  Newspaper O Globo reported on Monday, a day after some of his hardcore supporters stormed the capital city of Brasilia.
[00:35:15.113 --> 00:35:17.075]  Well, I would have told him, don't eat that Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[00:35:17.855 --> 00:35:19.456]  He was too Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[00:35:21.098 --> 00:35:24.220]  Bolsonaro admitted to hospital in the United States.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.661]  So we'll be watching that.
[00:35:25.721 --> 00:35:26.642]  He's a great president.
[00:35:26.722 --> 00:35:27.763]  I'd say even better than Trump.
[00:35:28.715 --> 00:35:29.796]  When it came to policies.
[00:35:30.817 --> 00:35:32.458]  Ann came out and said the vaccine was dangerous.
[00:35:32.859 --> 00:35:33.760]  There wasn't a vaccine.
[00:35:35.762 --> 00:35:40.966]  But let's get back first into Kevin McCarthy and what happened last week.
[00:35:43.008 --> 00:35:47.332]  Roger Stone was on the show six months ago, long before the election of 2022.
[00:35:48.533 --> 00:35:50.535]  He said, I predict they don't win the Senate.
[00:35:50.775 --> 00:35:54.219]  He predicted Trump, by the way, would have it stolen from him two and a half years ago.
[00:35:55.734 --> 00:36:01.058]  He said, I predict that they will get a narrow majority of 15 to 25 seats.
[00:36:01.198 --> 00:36:04.061]  In fact, our archivist can probably find that.
[00:36:04.901 --> 00:36:05.502]  See if he can.
[00:36:06.863 --> 00:36:09.025]  He said it three or four or five months before the election.
[00:36:09.045 --> 00:36:10.266]  He said it a week before the election.
[00:36:11.587 --> 00:36:12.308]  He really nailed it.
[00:36:13.549 --> 00:36:14.589]  He said it every time he was on.
[00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:18.593]  And so he said, that's almost better.
[00:36:19.775 --> 00:36:24.376]  Then having a big majority, because then so many of those will be neocons and rhinos.
[00:36:25.256 --> 00:36:47.581]  But if you have a very small coalition, when you have a razor-thin margin, it's an example of how Mnuchin of West Virginia, and I'm not saying he's a good guy, but he's better than Biden, can hold up carbon taxes and really bad things like that, that would kill his state, because there was such a razor-thin majority for Democrats in the Senate.
[00:36:48.786 --> 00:36:52.748]  Well, this is the same kind of scenario, except we don't have Mnuchin.
[00:36:52.788 --> 00:36:54.168]  We have Matt Gaetz.
[00:36:54.229 --> 00:36:55.569]  We have Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:57.550]  We have Goezer.
[00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:00.531]  We have so many other people that have really good voting records.
[00:37:01.572 --> 00:37:03.733]  And that's how she was convinced by Trump.
[00:37:03.873 --> 00:37:06.474]  MTG's been on the show and explained this weeks ago.
[00:37:06.494 --> 00:37:08.035]  It's probably coming on today or tomorrow.
[00:37:09.856 --> 00:37:10.976]  And Trump was like, no, no, no.
[00:37:11.036 --> 00:37:12.137]  You'll have a razor thin.
[00:37:12.237 --> 00:37:16.759]  You'll be able to do what Roger Stone said and really be able to control legislation.
[00:37:18.038 --> 00:37:26.440]  But if you don't have McCarthy in there, or if McCarthy does get angry, he can go to the Democrats and form a coalition with them.
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.320]  And that's why MTG did what she did.
[00:37:29.761 --> 00:37:31.421]  I'm not saying it's going to work out to be right.
[00:37:31.501 --> 00:37:32.301]  We don't know yet.
[00:37:32.441 --> 00:37:41.344]  But to sit there and have some of the right-wing talk show hosts say that she's a traitor or Matt Gaetz is a traitor, they're terrible people now because they did this.
[00:37:41.524 --> 00:37:42.564]  I didn't want McCarthy in there.
[00:37:43.519 --> 00:37:48.702]  I thought we should have had a better speaker who would guarantee more things and work with that razor-thin majority.
[00:37:49.563 --> 00:37:55.586]  But they're still going to have to work with that razor-thin minority now that makes up the majority.
[00:37:57.067 --> 00:38:00.849]  And so it's a very, very powerful position right now.
[00:38:01.569 --> 00:38:10.555]   Now if we start seeing Matt Gaetz and MTG and Gozer and Paul Gozer and the rest of them, Going along with McCarthy?
[00:38:11.095 --> 00:38:12.296]  And going along with the neocons?
[00:38:12.336 --> 00:38:17.280]  Well then, I'm going to get very, very upset, and it's time to put their feet to the fire.
[00:38:18.061 --> 00:38:25.726]  But I don't think MTG, and I don't think Matt Gaetz, and I don't think Gozer, and I don't think those guys are going to do bad things like this.
[00:38:25.746 --> 00:38:41.137]   You know, we've seen people like Jim Jordan not Support breaking up Google or not support stopping Google's intership and it turns out he's on the Google payroll.
[00:38:42.357 --> 00:38:45.259]  I still like most of what he does but at the key areas he lets us down.
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:55.304]  So I don't want to see that slide by these other America first Republicans towards that.
[00:38:55.344 --> 00:39:09.742]   I think it's really up to us to do as much as we can to stay informed and push An America world-saving agenda on them and on the public, like job number one.
[00:39:10.851 --> 00:39:13.133]  Let's start the impeachment process of Joe Biden.
[00:39:13.153 --> 00:39:14.154]  You have control of the House.
[00:39:14.614 --> 00:39:16.655]  McCarthy has said he wouldn't go for impeachment.
[00:39:16.695 --> 00:39:19.598]  The word is now he says he will if they have the votes.
[00:39:20.258 --> 00:39:39.333]  And you put on display that Biden is a fraud, that Biden is a minion of Obama, that Biden's dissolved the borders, that Biden's human trafficking, that Biden's letting the fentanyl in, that Biden and the Hunter laptop and all the corporate big tech censorship and the poison shots and Fauci and investigation of gain of function.
[00:39:40.515 --> 00:39:44.518]  And get on the offense like the Democrats have been with their hearings.
[00:39:44.778 --> 00:39:45.858]  They had nothing burgers.
[00:39:45.878 --> 00:39:48.540]  They had made up Russia and made up Ukraine crap.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.341]  None of it was true.
[00:39:49.561 --> 00:39:51.462]  They had January 6 BS.
[00:39:53.183 --> 00:39:54.484]  We have the deep state.
[00:39:54.544 --> 00:39:55.645]  We have the Democrats.
[00:39:55.705 --> 00:39:56.385]  We have them.
[00:39:56.425 --> 00:39:57.406]  So I will tell you this.
[00:39:58.847 --> 00:40:02.569]  I've told MTG this and I've told other members of Congress this and I know you've been telling them.
[00:40:03.249 --> 00:40:16.248]   As a big blister ship of millions of people, you need to be contacting You're Republican representatives and you need to be demanding that they initiate impeachment charges and impeachment investigation because it's the right thing to do.
[00:40:17.029 --> 00:40:18.731]  We have high crimes and misdemeanors.
[00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:20.032]  We have treason going on.
[00:40:20.312 --> 00:40:23.375]  We have the Hunter laptop where he says, I'm a Chinese spy.
[00:40:23.715 --> 00:40:29.180]  I'm under the command of the head of Chinese intelligence and he's been disappeared and I'm scared and don't know what to do.
[00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:33.078]  Biden is on the Communist Chinese payroll.
[00:40:33.278 --> 00:40:34.741]  He's on the Huawei payroll.
[00:40:34.801 --> 00:40:36.183]  He's on the Ukrainian payroll.
[00:40:36.263 --> 00:40:38.867]  And we need an investigation of where the Ukraine money's gone?
[00:40:40.168 --> 00:40:43.569]  We need an investigation of where the Chinese Communist money's gone.
[00:40:44.029 --> 00:40:51.851]  We need an investigation of all the Russian money that's been pouring in like a fire hose into the Democrat Party.
[00:40:52.091 --> 00:40:54.011]  Not just Ukrainian money, the Russians!
[00:40:54.472 --> 00:40:55.892]  Hell, the mayor of Moscow!
[00:40:56.152 --> 00:40:58.833]  Millions and millions and millions of dollars to Hunter and his daddy!
[00:40:59.353 --> 00:41:03.054]  And Burisma, and the gas pipelines, and all the scams that are going on!
[00:41:05.194 --> 00:41:08.415]  So we need new articles of impeachment to be drawn up and introduced.
[00:41:09.622 --> 00:41:15.445]  Dr. Francis Boyle wrote some up a few months ago, they got circulated, but those were mainly on Ukraine and Russia.
[00:41:15.945 --> 00:41:18.086]  We need a populist America first.
[00:41:19.047 --> 00:41:25.790]  Hell, I wrote articles of impeachment when Obama was in there and they got picked up in the news, because it points out the bill of particulars.
[00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:29.132]  It points out the crimes committed by the crown.
[00:41:29.472 --> 00:41:54.100]   In the decade leading up to the Revolutionary War in 1776, there was a decade of what they called Pampletiers, Villa particulars, where people wrote handbooks and little newspapers, press releases that listed the crimes of the Crown and listed the things they were doing and exposed it to the public so they could build a major opposition to it.
[00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:58.795]  Now McCarthy's saying he's going to do some good things, and the litmus test is there now.
[00:41:58.875 --> 00:42:12.454]   He said that they'd pressure Democrats during the armed services hearings, before the Republicans even took the House, that they would vote for the spending bill if they killed mandatory COVID shots for the troops. That happened.
[00:42:12.454 --> 00:42:16.702]   That was a big victory. Now McCarthy, we'll play a few of these clips now, has come out and said
[00:42:16.702 --> 00:42:22.373]   that they're going to get rid of the 87,000 new IRS agents. And that's critical because the
[00:42:22.373 --> 00:42:28.594]   last two years, as we told you, now it's official, Biden more than quadrupled the amount of
[00:42:28.594 --> 00:42:33.552]   audits and harassment of people making less than $40,000 a year.
[00:42:33.796 --> 00:42:35.516]  Those folks don't even pay most of the taxes.
[00:42:36.777 --> 00:42:42.438]  In an open country, you don't tax middle class and blue collar working class people at any high level.
[00:42:42.738 --> 00:42:44.399]  And you certainly don't prosecute them or target them.
[00:42:44.719 --> 00:42:46.259]  Almost no targeting of rich people.
[00:42:46.659 --> 00:42:48.100]  We will hold the swamp accountable.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:52.360]   targeting of the common people to squeeze them and drive them into welfare
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:57.480]   and to the universal basic income. Here's the headline in 2022 the IRS went after
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:04.360]   the very poorest taxpayers Fox News shame on these criminals for this. So we need to
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.639]   see this reversed. Here is a clip seven and eight of McCarthy or eight and nine
[00:43:08.639 --> 00:43:14.119]   here it is. We will hold the swamp accountable from the withdrawal of
[00:43:14.119 --> 00:43:22.358]   Afghanistan to the origins of COVID and to the weaponization of the FBI.
[00:43:22.358 --> 00:43:32.358]  [Applause]
[00:43:32.322 --> 00:43:33.882]  Let me be very clear.
[00:43:35.303 --> 00:43:41.364]  We will use the power of the purse and the power of the subpoena to get the job done.
[00:43:44.659 --> 00:43:52.563]  I know the night is late, but when we come back, our very first bill will repeal the funding for 87,000 DILs.
[00:43:52.423 --> 00:43:54.423]  87,000 DIA.
[00:43:54.423 --> 00:44:01.423]  [Applause]
[00:44:01.423 --> 00:44:03.423]  Hour number two is straight ahead.
[00:44:03.423 --> 00:44:05.423]  Everybody you know, tune in now.
[00:44:05.423 --> 00:44:07.423]  Fight the info war.
[00:44:07.423 --> 00:44:13.423]   You see, we believe government should be to help you, not go after you.
[00:44:13.423 --> 00:44:16.423]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:44:16.783 --> 00:44:28.783]  Stay with us.

[00:45:01.381 --> 00:45:04.443]  And we've got some other great sleep aids as well, and they're excellent.
[00:45:04.463 --> 00:45:05.324]  They're all different formulas.
[00:45:05.864 --> 00:45:09.427]  But this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[00:45:09.948 --> 00:45:15.232]  So Down and Out, sold out for more than five months, is now back available at InfoWarStore.com.

[00:45:24.216 --> 00:45:31.545]  English historian Peter Heather controversially argued that Rome was ultimately overcome by illegal immigration.
[00:45:31.645 --> 00:45:40.195]  Heather accepted the academic analysis that the Huns on the Pontic Steppe in the late 4th century set these migrations in motion.
[00:45:40.896 --> 00:45:42.477]  Those are catapults.
[00:45:42.697 --> 00:45:52.781]  However, according to Heather, the assumption that the barbarians were then peacefully absorbed into Rome smells more of wishful thinking than likely reality.
[00:45:53.061 --> 00:45:56.843]  Rome had always been an inclusive society that welcomed immigrants.
[00:45:57.163 --> 00:46:02.665]  Immigrants were given employment in the Roman army, but were welcome only if they assimilated.
[00:46:02.925 --> 00:46:04.546]  Of course, Rome still fell.
[00:46:04.986 --> 00:46:21.651]  What makes anyone think that the United States and Europe can absorb violent, non-assimilating immigrants from all over the world, with the result not ultimately collapsing 21st century civilization?
[00:46:21.751 --> 00:46:24.652]  The drug crisis in the United States continues to escalate.
[00:46:24.672 --> 00:46:28.333]  This year, more than 100,000 Americans died due to a drug overdose.
[00:46:28.773 --> 00:46:31.654]  It is now one of the top ten reasons for deaths in America.
[00:46:31.854 --> 00:46:44.560]  Breitbart reported that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration over its rule change allowing immigrants into the country who will be dependent on welfare.
[00:46:45.099 --> 00:46:51.839]   Federal immigration law has required a public charge determination for immigrants, which
[00:46:51.839 --> 00:46:57.438]   bars them from staying in the country if they are likely to use welfare programs like food
[00:46:57.438 --> 00:47:00.199]  stamps, Medicaid, or government housing.
[00:47:00.199 --> 00:47:06.519]   Studies show taxpayers are being billed about $1,600 a year per immigrant, and that immigrants
[00:47:06.519 --> 00:47:12.039]  use 33% more cash welfare than American citizens.
[00:47:12.039 --> 00:47:21.079]   Similarly, about 63% of non-citizen households use at least one form of public welfare, while
[00:47:21.079 --> 00:47:27.519]   only about 35% of native-born American households are on welfare.
[00:47:27.828 --> 00:47:31.370]  The architects of this collapse know full well what they're doing.
[00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:36.552]  We hear frequently that people are at the center of sustainable development.
[00:47:37.633 --> 00:47:41.595]  And we know that, by definition, people are at the center of populations.
[00:47:42.679 --> 00:47:53.933]  Well, from these two simple observations, it follows that an understanding of population patterns and trends will be essential for the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
[00:47:54.994 --> 00:47:55.735]  Let me be clear.
[00:47:56.545 --> 00:48:01.147]  Title 42 or not, the border is not open.
[00:48:01.808 --> 00:48:08.511]  The collapse is right in front of us, as Californians flee for Mexico under California Governor Newsom.
[00:48:08.551 --> 00:48:10.572]  Both fear leaving California too.
[00:48:11.013 --> 00:48:18.416]  Some fear that mass departures by the state's billionaires and tech companies could reduce local and state tax revenues.
[00:48:18.817 --> 00:48:25.200]  Just 1% of California's top income earners are responsible for half of all income tax revenue.
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:30.482]  Those drops could have the potential to affect the government services for years to come.
[00:48:30.782 --> 00:48:34.843]  And illegals kill Americans at a higher rate than Americans kill each other.
[00:48:35.144 --> 00:48:41.426]  How many American children are going to be burned alive before our elected leaders decide to take action?
[00:48:41.866 --> 00:48:43.026]  The Republicans don't care.
[00:48:43.066 --> 00:48:44.707]  They don't want to stand up to the donor class.
[00:48:44.947 --> 00:48:46.248]  The Democrats sure don't care.
[00:48:46.308 --> 00:48:47.328]  They want new voters.
[00:48:47.368 --> 00:48:47.988]  Big business?
[00:48:48.408 --> 00:48:49.509]  They want cheap labor.
[00:48:50.029 --> 00:49:00.933]  Meanwhile, ICE is confirming that Jose Rosales, who is accused of killing Harris County, Texas, Corporal Charles Galloway, is in the country illegally when he murdered that officer.
[00:49:01.193 --> 00:49:02.374]  Tell us what happened to your brother.
[00:49:02.494 --> 00:49:06.915]  He was murdered in 2018 by an illegal criminal alien.
[00:49:06.935 --> 00:49:13.158]  She was rear-ended by Edwin Mejia, who was 19 years old, here illegally.
[00:49:13.738 --> 00:49:20.022]  Margarito Quintero Rosales told authorities he fell asleep at the wheel and his van drifted into the oncoming lane.
[00:49:20.602 --> 00:49:21.542]  He was here illegally.
[00:49:22.123 --> 00:49:31.928]  There's not a day goes by in this country that there isn't at least one American citizen that dies at the hands of someone who's unlawfully present in the United States.
[00:49:32.648 --> 00:49:50.096]   Whether it is an act of homicide, whether it's an act of willful manslaughter, whether it's an OWI on the streets of America, Hardly anybody has gone through the last 10 years and doesn't at least see that show up in their local newspaper if it doesn't show up in their neighborhood.
[00:49:50.856 --> 00:50:05.300]  The cold reality ignored by the media industrial complex lingers in the shadows of a crumbling America, vomiting the United Nations replacement migration directive fueled by globalist trillionaire NGOs.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:14.929]  Kept in motion by runaway government corruption and rammed down the throats of the American taxpayer in order to usher in a new world order.
[00:50:15.249 --> 00:50:16.450]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:20.274]  Alright folks, we've got big news.
[00:50:21.415 --> 00:50:23.036]  Biden's been caught red-handed coming up.
[00:50:23.857 --> 00:50:25.959]  We are now into hour number two.
[00:50:25.979 --> 00:50:28.681]  I'm gonna be hosting all four hours today until 3 p.m.
[00:50:28.701 --> 00:50:29.122]  Central.
[00:50:31.198 --> 00:50:40.707]  The gun shop and gun trainer owner of Central Texas Gun Works, Mr. Cargill, will be joining us in the fourth hour.
[00:50:41.347 --> 00:50:52.437]  His lawsuit against the Trump-era bump stock ban has been overturned by a federal court, by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
[00:50:52.477 --> 00:50:57.382]  He'll be in studio coming up in the fourth hour.
[00:50:58.763 --> 00:51:15.837]  In the third hour, Roger Stone's going to join us to talk about Nixon's 109th birthday today, reflections on the JFK assassination and what Nixon told him about who really killed Kennedy, which I concur with that analysis, LBJ.
[00:51:17.559 --> 00:51:26.847]  We're also going to then look at what happened with McCarthy last week and going forward what the real agenda should be and how important this tiny majority is because it's controlled by patriots.
[00:51:27.984 --> 00:51:32.706]  That's all coming up in the third hour today.
[00:51:33.226 --> 00:51:36.267]  Got a bunch of big guests throughout the week as well, and we'll have open phones.
[00:51:36.647 --> 00:51:39.168]  Remember, it's not just the Alex Jones Show here at InfoWars.
[00:51:39.288 --> 00:51:48.011]  It's the informative, amazing callers, incredible guests, powerful analysis, and great wit and humor by Harrison Smith, 8 a.m.
[00:51:48.051 --> 00:51:48.811]  to 11 a.m.
[00:51:48.851 --> 00:51:51.532]  Central, weekday mornings, Monday through Friday.
[00:51:52.392 --> 00:51:56.295]  Infowars.com forward slash show on many stations across the country.
[00:51:56.395 --> 00:51:57.696]  It's the American Journal.
[00:51:58.117 --> 00:52:02.180]  Then of course the War Room with Owen Schroyer 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:03.461]  Needs no introduction.
[00:52:04.562 --> 00:52:11.647]  We are fighting now harder than ever and I don't want you ever forget that as viewers and listeners you are the emissaries.
[00:52:12.328 --> 00:52:14.629]  You are the ambassadors.
[00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:33.920]   You are the people that are on the ground That can reach out to people that are looking for the truth, who have open minds, and direct them to this broadcast, which has been proven to be the most informative, powerful, ahead-of-the-curve tool.
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:36.681]  And this morning, I'm going to leave it at this.
[00:52:37.401 --> 00:53:08.294]   I got a nice text message from a very well-known talk show host, household name, saying, I really appreciate your work as a trailblazer, first exposing what is now coming out with big tech, Under government control, even when Trump was in, it was the Obama-Globalist Combine with a stay-behind network that they criminally set up with almost $3 billion, like $2.9 something billion, in the Countering Foreign Disinformation Propaganda Act.
[00:53:08.334 --> 00:53:19.052]   And that's why they declared Trump and myself And everybody else that was fighting the New World Order as Russian agents to then illegally, domestically use the CIA on us.
[00:53:19.573 --> 00:53:22.514]  I've been telling you that since before Trump got elected.
[00:53:25.315 --> 00:53:26.976]  That we were being spied on, surveilled.
[00:53:27.817 --> 00:53:28.397]  It's all here.
[00:53:29.317 --> 00:53:30.878]  Now, I didn't just have government documents.
[00:53:30.918 --> 00:53:32.459]  I didn't just have historical research.
[00:53:33.299 --> 00:53:34.380]  I also had sources.
[00:53:35.703 --> 00:53:55.381]  In the Pentagon, in Army Special Operations, in the White House, telling us specifically, and in the DEA of all places, they reached out and gave us very accurate information, because there are good agents in all these groups who do not like what's going on and are really upset about it, and who will go to a venue that's willing to tell the truth and get it to us.
[00:53:55.902 --> 00:54:01.267]  And that's why we had to be demonized, that's why they had to hire high-tech PR firms and globalist groups.
[00:54:02.472 --> 00:54:04.172]  To run the whole Sandy Hook thing on us.
[00:54:05.013 --> 00:54:10.514]  You noticed I was on Piers Morgan in 2013 after Sandy Hook.
[00:54:11.154 --> 00:54:12.975]  Didn't once on a show say it didn't happen.
[00:54:13.395 --> 00:54:15.255]  Didn't once on a show say any of that.
[00:54:15.315 --> 00:54:18.156]  I said, the kid was on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:54:18.576 --> 00:54:20.076]  His mom got in the gun illegally.
[00:54:21.497 --> 00:54:22.977]  Gun manufacturers aren't to blame.
[00:54:23.077 --> 00:54:25.018]  Well, why was I sued for saying it didn't happen?
[00:54:25.058 --> 00:54:26.538]  Because the internet didn't believe it happened.
[00:54:26.798 --> 00:54:28.959]  I looked at those theories and said, yeah, they staged stuff.
[00:54:29.339 --> 00:54:30.539]  I could see how it could be staged.
[00:54:31.513 --> 00:54:34.334]  They never really talked about it for several years after that.
[00:54:34.934 --> 00:54:36.094]  That came out in the lawsuit.
[00:54:36.214 --> 00:54:38.175]  The reason this is important is not about Sandy Hook.
[00:54:38.195 --> 00:54:39.075]  Just bear with me.
[00:54:42.376 --> 00:54:52.098]  They hired a PR firm, we learned after the fake lawsuits now, and the rigged courts, and the judges finding me guilty, and telling juries I was guilty, and all that, in my view, criminal activity by the judiciary.
[00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:58.020]  Went on, because they went into my timeline the few times I said, yeah, maybe it didn't happen.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.381]  Blew that up in 2016, 17, 18.
[00:55:01.641 --> 00:55:03.122]  Said I was attacking the families.
[00:55:03.562 --> 00:55:04.962]  Said I was going after people.
[00:55:05.302 --> 00:55:06.743]  Said I was doing things I never did.
[00:55:07.083 --> 00:55:09.004]  Said I was sending people to pee on kids' graves.
[00:55:09.304 --> 00:55:10.584]  All made up by a PR firm.
[00:55:13.305 --> 00:55:15.005]  I'm not allowed to put on evidence at the show trials.
[00:55:15.106 --> 00:55:16.506]  Already guilty, the judges say.
[00:55:18.086 --> 00:55:22.748]  And then they get to get up there and testify, never being able to be challenged, with no evidence of any of this.
[00:55:24.935 --> 00:55:31.417]  That was all done to set the precedent to bring us down so that then they can come after everybody else.
[00:55:31.617 --> 00:55:37.058]  And so now we know that and now that is completely and totally recognized.
[00:55:38.698 --> 00:55:41.219]  People will come up to me in the street and say, why do you keep saying it didn't happen?
[00:55:41.499 --> 00:55:42.559]  Why do you keep attacking the families?
[00:55:42.879 --> 00:55:44.520]  Years after I'd never even talked about it.
[00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:59.035]  Because the news was writing thousands of articles a week, and thousands of TV programs were saying that I was attacking and doing things I never did, and people didn't understand that the media was just making a much ado about nothing to go after the First Amendment.
[00:56:00.856 --> 00:56:02.816]  And that's where Tucker Carlson comes in now.
[00:56:03.017 --> 00:56:11.280]   We know the Democratic Party, thanks to lawsuits by the Attorney Generals of Louisiana and Missouri, Against Facebook and others.
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:15.241]  We have the documents that were put out this morning by the Attorney General of Louisiana.
[00:56:16.602 --> 00:56:30.425]  We have the White House documents under Biden ordering them to censor and block and delete Tucker Carlson reports off of Facebook and other big tech platforms and the White House threatening them when they didn't do a good enough job.
[00:56:32.766 --> 00:56:33.626]  That is illegal.
[00:56:33.706 --> 00:56:34.786]  That is election meddling.
[00:56:34.826 --> 00:56:36.367]  That is censorship by the government.
[00:56:36.407 --> 00:56:37.347]  That is not allowed.
[00:56:37.447 --> 00:56:38.147]  That is criminal.
[00:56:40.816 --> 00:56:45.001]  And now it's recognized that this was an information war and that we first raised the alarm.
[00:56:45.301 --> 00:56:50.528]  I'm going to hit some of these incredible emails from the White House from high-level staff members.
[00:56:52.179 --> 00:56:54.300]  To censor Tucker Carlson, of course, thousands of others.
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:56.240]  These are particularly on Tucker Carlson.
[00:56:56.721 --> 00:56:57.981]  But here's Representative Quigley.
[00:56:58.241 --> 00:56:59.481]  I mentioned this last hour.
[00:56:59.521 --> 00:57:00.442]  They found one of the clips.
[00:57:00.742 --> 00:57:01.782]  They found the House hearings.
[00:57:02.142 --> 00:57:05.503]  There's also Senate hearings where they said I was a Russian agent with no proof.
[00:57:06.084 --> 00:57:09.345]  But here they are saying InfoWars has the top story on Twitter today.
[00:57:09.365 --> 00:57:13.046]  A Muslim running people over with a truck screaming Allah Akbar, which he did.
[00:57:13.706 --> 00:57:15.847]  Quigley says it's a fake report, which it wasn't.
[00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:19.031]  And that we need to be censored.
[00:57:19.531 --> 00:57:28.738]  And the head technician there testifying for Twitter said, don't worry, sir, we'll have the AI censorship systems in place soon to carry that out.
[00:57:28.758 --> 00:57:30.340]  So people ask how I knew all this.
[00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:33.662]  There have been hearings where the government's demanding I be censored.
[00:57:35.343 --> 00:57:36.784]  I know about it through experience.
[00:57:36.824 --> 00:57:37.165]  Here it is.
[00:57:38.726 --> 00:58:03.147]  A short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag, NYC terrorist attack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam, I warned de Blasio about New York City terror, he was too busy bashing Trump.
[00:58:05.441 --> 00:58:12.783]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[00:58:13.683 --> 00:58:29.868]  How quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight so that the people who saw this know that it's fake news and at least at some point in time it can't keep spreading like some sort of virus through the legitimate world.
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:37.784]  That's something we're thinking about all the time, because it's a bad user experience, and we don't want to be known as a platform for that.
[00:58:38.084 --> 00:58:41.466]  In your example, for instance, the system self-corrected.
[00:58:41.486 --> 00:58:46.709]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore, it should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:48.710]  But you saw this?
[00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:49.631]  USA Today.
[00:58:50.051 --> 00:58:51.151]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[00:58:51.312 --> 00:58:53.693]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[00:58:54.693 --> 00:58:58.656]  Can you give me a really good guess on how long it was top?
[00:59:00.985 --> 00:59:05.827]  We can follow up with you and your staff on that, and I don't have the stat in front of me, so I don't know.
[00:59:06.228 --> 00:59:16.252]  But we're, like we said earlier, trying to balance free speech with making the information you see on the system, especially around trends that we direct you to.
[00:59:16.312 --> 00:59:22.315]  So if you're clicking on a hashtag, we want to make sure you're seeing verified accounts and accurate information and reporting.
[00:59:23.795 --> 00:59:24.856]  So let's unpack that.
[00:59:26.055 --> 00:59:31.818]  There they are taking Quigley's word for it that it's fake when he was al-Akbar and convicted and was a Muslim terrorist.
[00:59:31.998 --> 00:59:32.459]  It's admitted.
[00:59:32.979 --> 00:59:35.160]  And we're just pointing it out that the media was covering it up at the time.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.161]  They failed to cover it up.
[00:59:36.801 --> 00:59:37.661]  They say it's fake.
[00:59:37.702 --> 00:59:39.703]  He says, yes, at lunch we took it down.
[00:59:40.003 --> 00:59:42.924]  So they're working around the clock to keep him full wars down at that time.
[00:59:43.705 --> 00:59:46.767]  And they're just slandering us and defaming us and saying we put out fake news.
[00:59:47.947 --> 00:59:49.468]  And that they are the arbiters of truth.
[00:59:50.369 --> 00:59:52.670]  And at the same time denying they were censoring people.
[00:59:53.737 --> 01:00:00.542]  And now we have the White House directly coordinating, censoring Tucker Carlson on the fact that the vaccines weren't vaccines and they don't work.
[01:00:00.562 --> 01:00:03.164]  We're going to look at those emails when we come back.
[01:00:03.224 --> 01:00:04.025]  This is huge.
[01:00:04.405 --> 01:00:05.626]  Infowars.com.
[01:00:05.906 --> 01:00:07.127]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:00:07.207 --> 01:00:07.668]  Stay with us.
[01:00:08.681 --> 01:00:23.924]  So if you just joined us, we played a clip from four and a half years ago, Representative Quigley of Illinois asking the head Twitter operations director to censor InfoWars on truck attack news.
[01:00:25.748 --> 01:00:28.189]  Whether it's Kenosha years later, it's the same story in Europe.
[01:00:28.209 --> 01:00:28.949]  They'll arrest you.
[01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:30.530]  I'm not joking.
[01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:31.050]  You've seen it.
[01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:38.193]  If you say Islam is attacking, or if you criticize LGBT targeting of children, we've got new articles out on that today.
[01:00:38.773 --> 01:00:43.735]  But it came out days later that he did scream Allah Akbar, and he was a Muslim, and he was convicted.
[01:00:44.336 --> 01:00:47.857]  Suspect in New York Halloween terror attack was being wiretapped by the FBI.
[01:00:48.777 --> 01:00:49.978]  Did scream Allah Akbar.
[01:00:51.963 --> 01:00:52.904]  Right there's the Daily Mail.
[01:00:53.645 --> 01:01:03.874]  But you saw Congressman Quigley say it was a lie, and you saw Twitter agree, and that we had been censored.
[01:01:04.935 --> 01:01:11.621]  Obama-era FBI assistant director, America must accept terror attacks as the price of diversity.
[01:01:12.902 --> 01:01:13.503]  What is he now?
[01:01:13.523 --> 01:01:14.484]  A CNN analyst.
[01:01:16.744 --> 01:01:19.566]  They put their people in, not just big tech, but in the media.
[01:01:19.806 --> 01:01:27.832]  So here's the big bombshell that the Louisiana Attorney General has released in a co-lawsuit with Missouri's Attorney General.
[01:01:28.513 --> 01:01:34.257]  White House lobbied Facebook to censor Tucker Carlson over skepticism towards COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:01:34.317 --> 01:01:37.659]  And you've got to go read the emails for yourself.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.762]  They're posted at InfoWars.com.
[01:01:42.723 --> 01:01:43.864]  And here's just some of them.
[01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:50.235]  And again, I can read these all day long from senior White House staff.
[01:01:52.476 --> 01:02:00.183]  Wanted to flag the below tweet, and I'm wondering if we can get moving on the process of having it removed.
[01:02:00.243 --> 01:02:02.384]  It's not just Facebook, it's Twitter.
[01:02:02.805 --> 01:02:07.268]  And if we can help keep an eye for other tweets that fall in the same genre, that would be great.
[01:02:08.129 --> 01:02:09.950]  The tweet was Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.363]  Talking about the vaccine not being a vaccine and that children don't die from COVID.
[01:02:16.643 --> 01:02:17.824]  Oh, can't say something true.
[01:02:18.444 --> 01:02:21.907]  Can't say a Muslim screamed Allah Akbar and ran over people.
[01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:30.392]  Here White House directs Facebook to shut down conservative voices Tucker Carlson and Tommy Lauren.
[01:02:31.573 --> 01:02:34.214]  And it goes through how they want all of that shut down.
[01:02:34.234 --> 01:02:37.757]  They talk about how they're having phone conversations.
[01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:45.953]  And saying, you claim you can keep Tucker Carlson from trending, but your tools have been unable to do that.
[01:02:46.373 --> 01:02:49.174]  And they basically threaten them that they better take action.
[01:02:53.956 --> 01:02:55.717]  Why aren't you able to reduce his reach?
[01:02:57.858 --> 01:03:01.279]  Because, again, his story was number one.
[01:03:02.259 --> 01:03:02.720]  Here's more.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.541]  Here's an example of big tech telling the line for Biden.
[01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:13.373]  Here they are saying, we want you to censor this report, critical of Biden.
[01:03:17.695 --> 01:03:23.297]  Scientists warned a potential COVID vaccine related ticking time bomb, children's health defense.
[01:03:24.858 --> 01:03:29.360]  Oh my gosh, you can't have scientists on there warning that this would cause blood clots or heart attacks.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:31.781]  And it just goes on.
[01:03:33.604 --> 01:03:41.710]  And there's hundreds of these that the Attorney General has released.
[01:03:45.433 --> 01:03:55.001]  Particularly trying to suppress therapeutics and things that would protect people.
[01:03:56.082 --> 01:03:59.625]  Now we keep hearing from Elon Musk, he said he would release it last Thursday, he hasn't.
[01:04:00.768 --> 01:04:01.810]  The Fauci files.
[01:04:01.930 --> 01:04:03.352]  Is he holding them hostage?
[01:04:03.392 --> 01:04:04.614]  Is he blackmailing them or something?
[01:04:04.634 --> 01:04:06.057]  Because I want to see those files now.
[01:04:06.317 --> 01:04:07.158]  We know what Fauci did.
[01:04:07.198 --> 01:04:08.100]  It's come out other places.
[01:04:08.881 --> 01:04:14.630]  Other emails from other agencies and groups that he was working with big tech and the media to go around censoring everybody.
[01:04:16.365 --> 01:04:18.766]  Here's another one from Attorney General Andrew Bailey.
[01:04:19.267 --> 01:04:21.087]  The truth no longer matters to the White House.
[01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:26.730]  They really couldn't care less about products unless they're having measurable impact on suppressing speech.
[01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:36.735]  And they're calling Facebook here and Twitter and these emails products and saying your products are not suppressing our political enemies.
[01:04:37.816 --> 01:04:41.238]  And saying your algorithm is supposed to shift and suppress these people.
[01:04:42.603 --> 01:04:43.004]  It's not.
[01:04:43.424 --> 01:04:50.311]  Of course it is suppressing it, but human ingenuity promoting the clips and the links and people sharing them other ways is overpowering them.
[01:04:50.831 --> 01:04:54.095]  Same thing you've been doing with Infowars.com.
[01:04:58.099 --> 01:04:58.639]  It's incredible.
[01:04:58.659 --> 01:05:01.742]  You gotta go read all of this for yourself.
[01:05:02.263 --> 01:05:06.367]  Brazenly complaining and bitching that the censorship wasn't enough.
[01:05:09.818 --> 01:05:14.791]  And they want to control the trends, it says, and the conversations the public is having.
[01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:20.211]  control the conversations that the public's having.
[01:05:20.211 --> 01:05:24.331]   Attorney General said this, "These emails confirm what we've done all along.
[01:05:24.331 --> 01:05:28.112]   The Biden administration has been colluding with social media companies to stifle opposing voices.
[01:05:28.112 --> 01:05:34.230]   I will continue to push back against this blatant attack on the First Amendment with every tool at my disposal."
[01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:38.590]   I'd like people to contact the attorney generals of Missouri and Louisiana and ask them to release,
[01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:43.152]   'cause they have millions of pages of documents, the Alex Jones InfoWars information.
[01:05:43.403 --> 01:05:46.345]  And I guarantee you there's stuff in there about censoring Joe Rogan.
[01:05:46.705 --> 01:05:49.667]  We need, and Dr. Peter McCullough, we need to see that now.
[01:05:49.967 --> 01:05:55.911]  But great job to those Attorney Generals, particularly the one from Louisiana.
[01:05:56.491 --> 01:05:59.413]  That is a big, big deal.
[01:06:00.314 --> 01:06:13.320]   You see, when they're gaslighting you, when they're building Potemkin villages, When they're rolling out poison shots that erase your immune system, and in their own literature, they suppressed linked infertility, blood clots, strokes, heart attacks, myocarditis.
[01:06:14.641 --> 01:06:20.186]  The emperor can't wander around butt naked if somebody can step forward and say the emperor is wearing no clothes.
[01:06:20.546 --> 01:06:26.951]  Or if Toto's gonna pull back the curtain in Wizard of Oz, they gotta stay behind the curtain or it doesn't work.
[01:06:27.892 --> 01:06:33.691]   I know I'm saying the obvious, but Biden was in South Texas on the Mexican border for two hours.
[01:06:33.711 --> 01:06:43.859]  This plane landed, he got off, drove around for an hour and a half, got cheered by illegal aliens behind a fence, and then flew on to Mexico to call for carbon taxes and the New World Order.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:51.145]  When I talk about a Potemkin village, there are a lot of famous examples of this, but here's one going back to 2003.
[01:06:51.185 --> 01:06:53.247]  Queen visits mock Nigerian visit.
[01:06:56.769 --> 01:06:58.290]  That's when she was 72 years old.
[01:06:58.771 --> 01:07:01.293]  Turns out she did it back when she was younger as well.
[01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:02.634]  And so did her mother.
[01:07:04.215 --> 01:07:06.297]  Queen visits mock Nigerian village.
[01:07:08.979 --> 01:07:11.121]  Queen visits fake village due to security.
[01:07:13.743 --> 01:07:16.365]  Queen's visit fake African village due to security.
[01:07:18.226 --> 01:07:23.891]  Here it was done by her predecessors rediscovering the 1947 royal visit to South Africa.
[01:07:23.911 --> 01:07:25.872]  So they did it before that as well.
[01:07:27.208 --> 01:07:30.410]  So we're not supposed to talk about crisis actors or staged events.
[01:07:31.791 --> 01:07:32.932]  Here's Town Hall.
[01:07:33.372 --> 01:07:36.434]  Biden's border trip slammed as meaningless and hollow.
[01:07:36.714 --> 01:07:37.215]  Town Hall.
[01:07:37.655 --> 01:07:38.776]  How about completely fake?
[01:07:39.116 --> 01:07:40.797]  Here's what a Potemkin village is.
[01:07:41.858 --> 01:07:53.085]  Named for purported fake settlement erected at the direction of the Russian minister to fool Empress Catherine II during her visit to Crimea in 1787.
[01:07:53.225 --> 01:07:56.388]  They created a whole fake village.
[01:07:57.168 --> 01:08:11.915]  Oh, but you're not supposed to talk about how they stage events, how Jesse Smollett does it, or how ABC News said footage during the Syrian war was whole cities being vaporized when it was the machine gun shootout at Knob Creek shooting cans of gasoline.
[01:08:13.195 --> 01:08:15.517]  They said the cans of gasoline were 20-story buildings.
[01:08:16.757 --> 01:08:20.079]  No, no, you're supposed to just sit there and take it or we'll sue you!
[01:08:21.357 --> 01:08:24.658]  And say you're guilty and charge you a billion and a half dollars that doesn't exist.
[01:08:25.519 --> 01:08:31.761]  They're scared of you questioning these events because nine times out of ten they're totally staged or partially staged.
[01:08:32.181 --> 01:08:33.242]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:08:34.162 --> 01:08:40.945]  The enemies of America, the enemies of free humanity, the enemies of life, the servants of the devilish system.
[01:08:42.882 --> 01:08:55.910]  No, that nine times out of ten when they track back where the awakening came from, where the main resistance sprung forth, it's from you, the incredible audience of viewers and listeners that are incredible activists that have changed the world.
[01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:59.932]  We would have no chance of beating this if it wasn't for the incredible work you've done.
[01:08:59.952 --> 01:09:02.734]  Now, I've done a pretty good job so far, I think, today.
[01:09:04.594 --> 01:09:06.875]  I'm covering five or six huge developments.
[01:09:07.735 --> 01:09:16.438]  I want to get into the latest poison vaccine news and how it's just exploding and the censorship that went on is coming out and it's just wild.
[01:09:16.478 --> 01:09:17.399]  I got to stack on that.
[01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:21.360]  Then I've got the next way they're going to target our children.
[01:09:22.461 --> 01:09:33.685]  Not just the transgenderism, not just the brainwashing, not just the GMO, not just the poison shots, but a whole other area we're going to be hitting here in just a moment.
[01:09:35.441 --> 01:09:42.886]  And then Roger Stone joins us with the whole congressional lineup and the fight that's coming and what really happened last week and so much more.
[01:09:44.327 --> 01:09:57.257]  And then we've got the head of the Central Texas Gun Works, Michael Cargill, joining us in the fourth hour that I'm going to be hosting today.
[01:09:58.743 --> 01:10:01.965]  Mr. Cargill has sued the government repeatedly trying to take his rights.
[01:10:01.985 --> 01:10:03.566]  In almost every case, he's won.
[01:10:03.626 --> 01:10:05.828]  In fact, I think in the lawsuits he's filed, he's always won.
[01:10:05.848 --> 01:10:07.389]  The guy is something else.
[01:10:07.809 --> 01:10:10.771]  He got the federal bump stock ban overturned.
[01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:11.972]  You say, well, that's just bump stocks.
[01:10:12.412 --> 01:10:13.313]  Who cares about those?
[01:10:13.993 --> 01:10:26.011]   They're going to use that to start banning all the other accessories, like this new ATF rule, getting rid of shortening AR-15s and things like that with so-called pistol grips.
[01:10:27.212 --> 01:10:29.993]  So if you let them have the bump stocks, you're gonna move everything else.
[01:10:30.013 --> 01:10:33.355]  This is one of the bad things Trump went along with after the Vegas situation.
[01:10:34.536 --> 01:10:35.477]  Now overturned.
[01:10:36.377 --> 01:10:37.338]  That's in the fourth hour.
[01:10:37.438 --> 01:10:42.781]  And just remember, we're at the very epicenter of the resistance, just like with Cargill coming in here.
[01:10:43.242 --> 01:10:44.522]  And I appreciate your support.
[01:10:46.203 --> 01:10:48.525]  But now more than ever, we need the support.
[01:10:48.545 --> 01:10:56.515]   There's nothing more frustrating Then getting through all these fake lawsuits and all these fake judgments and everything that almost destroyed us, but thanks for your support, we're still here.
[01:10:58.096 --> 01:11:00.577]  And now we're in Chapter 11, Subchapter 5 bankruptcy.
[01:11:00.617 --> 01:11:07.542]  That's an emergency reorganization, meaning with their fake judgments, they just can't come in here and put bad locks on the door and shut this down.
[01:11:07.582 --> 01:11:09.983]  We have two to four years of appeals.
[01:11:11.444 --> 01:11:12.325]  We are appealing.
[01:11:14.171 --> 01:11:22.993]  And at the same time, the emergency reorganization allows us to continue on and keep this whole crew employed and keep yours truly on the air.
[01:11:23.013 --> 01:11:31.275]  The only way we can take it off the air is if I get killed or put in prison or die in a car wreck or something today, or if you don't support the broadcast.
[01:11:31.335 --> 01:11:34.276]  And God loves to torture me, and it's always in God's plan.
[01:11:35.683 --> 01:11:36.763]  God likes to keep me hungry.
[01:11:36.803 --> 01:11:37.904]  God likes to keep me on my toes.
[01:11:37.944 --> 01:11:38.744]  And I understand that.
[01:11:38.824 --> 01:11:39.804]  And it can keep me humble.
[01:11:40.124 --> 01:11:43.125]  But it's driving me crazy for the last few years.
[01:11:43.265 --> 01:11:44.785]  Always being right on the edge of the red.
[01:11:45.285 --> 01:11:47.046]  Always going back and forth, the black and the red.
[01:11:47.586 --> 01:11:52.127]  And then now I have $237,000 underages each month, which sounds like a lot.
[01:11:52.147 --> 01:11:57.208]  But with an organization this big and what we've done in the past, that's a very small underage.
[01:11:57.489 --> 01:11:58.909]  Our bandwidth costs that every month.
[01:12:00.385 --> 01:12:01.886]  So I don't want to lay people off.
[01:12:01.966 --> 01:12:03.547]  I don't want to shut down Bandai Video.
[01:12:03.807 --> 01:12:05.188]  I don't want the enemy to have victories.
[01:12:05.288 --> 01:12:14.175]  I want to stay on air to their outrage and anger at this most critical time where everything we've talked about has come true and we're being totally vindicated.
[01:12:14.215 --> 01:12:15.055]  So it's a win-win.
[01:12:15.636 --> 01:12:23.421]  Just go to infowarestore.com and get great products that enrich yourself and your life at the same time keeping us on the air.
[01:12:23.661 --> 01:12:24.722]  This is your broadcast.
[01:12:25.082 --> 01:12:25.843]  This belongs to you.
[01:12:27.987 --> 01:12:29.027]  You're the reason we're here.
[01:12:29.087 --> 01:12:30.028]  You're our eyes and ears.
[01:12:30.208 --> 01:12:31.868]  You literally are the info war.
[01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:36.250]  And I know because of the money crunch, we don't have the t-shirts anymore.
[01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:37.670]  We have like five or six that are left.
[01:12:38.210 --> 01:12:40.111]  Don't have the money to even buy future t-shirts right now.
[01:12:40.151 --> 01:12:41.111]  I'm trying to get the money.
[01:12:41.451 --> 01:12:42.892]  But that's a good funding situation.
[01:12:43.652 --> 01:12:46.533]  We don't have the money to launch some of the new products we want.
[01:12:46.953 --> 01:12:48.253]  So there's a lot of stuff going on.
[01:12:48.273 --> 01:12:49.254]  Take X2 and X3.
[01:12:49.814 --> 01:12:51.855]  Don't have the money in the budget right now to buy those.
[01:12:51.875 --> 01:12:52.595]  Those are sold out.
[01:12:55.896 --> 01:13:01.103]  We're trying to get the money together to reorder them, so that in six weeks... Another glass of water guys, thanks.
[01:13:02.265 --> 01:13:11.197]  So that in six weeks, we'll be able to have that product, that when we're able to keep it in stock, funds the operation and keeps us on air.
[01:13:14.136 --> 01:13:19.983]  So, we're in a conundrum right now, but it's not an obstacle that we can't make it through.
[01:13:20.003 --> 01:13:26.870]  The problem is, with the outages of the last few years, I had an emergency backup nest egg or a reserve tank.
[01:13:27.851 --> 01:13:36.346]   I have spent every bit of that, every bit of that, is gone so there is no more reserve tank.
[01:13:36.346 --> 01:13:39.746]   So just go to infowarestore.com, get the products you already need,
[01:13:39.746 --> 01:13:42.585]  keep us on air, boost your immune system and so much more.
[01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:46.466]   Now we have vitamin mineral fusion, and we have DNA force plus that are rolls Royces
[01:13:46.466 --> 01:13:51.826]   for your immune system, your body, your telomeres, your DNA, everything.
[01:13:51.826 --> 01:13:59.746]   And they're gonna sell out in the next week at current sales rates at 50% off.
[01:13:59.746 --> 01:14:01.465]  But we need the money now.
[01:14:01.465 --> 01:14:06.824]   So I'm gonna go ahead and keep them on sale until tomorrow night and then that's absolutely it
[01:14:06.824 --> 01:14:13.985]   for vitamin mineral fusion and DNA force plus at infowarestore.com.
[01:14:13.985 --> 01:14:17.425]  It'll be months and months till those come back in.
[01:14:17.425 --> 01:14:18.824]  So this is your chance to get them.
[01:14:18.824 --> 01:14:21.824]   I thank you for your support, but you really need to be taking these.
[01:14:21.824 --> 01:14:27.461]   Also, back in stock, if you're being sold out Our strongest sleep aid.

[01:14:31.644 --> 01:14:32.224]  Down and out.
[01:14:32.525 --> 01:14:33.125]  Very strong.
[01:14:33.165 --> 01:14:34.146]  Be careful when you take it.
[01:14:34.846 --> 01:14:37.748]  It's available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:42.632]  Or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:14:42.932 --> 01:14:44.333]  But again, down and out.
[01:14:44.974 --> 01:14:47.736]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:14:47.756 --> 01:14:48.216]  50% off.
[01:14:48.576 --> 01:15:08.948]   And finally, Real Red Pill Plus is a proprietary product with preglanone, a bunch of trace elements, minerals, vitamins, and other key compounds that have been documented and associated with longevity, that have been associated with a healthier overall life.
[01:15:13.812 --> 01:15:16.333]  Just the pregnenolone alone is made naturally in the body.
[01:15:16.353 --> 01:15:18.034]  It's the precursor to all hormones.
[01:15:18.074 --> 01:15:19.634]  As you get older, your body stops producing it.
[01:15:20.355 --> 01:15:22.536]  You should be taking Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:15:22.956 --> 01:15:25.957]  Now, we got a moderate-sized order of it in three weeks ago.
[01:15:25.977 --> 01:15:28.758]  We've already sold out of the vast majority of it.
[01:15:29.178 --> 01:15:33.280]  It would sell out in a few weeks at current sales rates of 50% off, but we got to have the money.
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:37.902]  So it's staying at 50% off despite the fact Real Red Pill Plus is selling out.
[01:15:38.702 --> 01:15:41.243]  At InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:44.685]  So experience Real Red Bill Plus, keep InfoWars on the air.

[01:15:47.666 --> 01:15:48.667]  Thank you for your past support.
[01:15:48.687 --> 01:15:50.047]  I want to thank you for your future support.
[01:15:50.347 --> 01:15:56.590]  Take action now for Real Red Bill Plus, Vitamin Refusion, DNA Force Plus, and Knockout.
[01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:58.631]  Sleep support is obviously excellent.
[01:15:58.671 --> 01:16:04.274]  It's not as strong as Down and Out, and they're both in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:16:04.334 --> 01:16:05.114]  Thank you for the support.
[01:16:05.294 --> 01:16:06.795]  All right, let's dive back into this.
[01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:11.586]  Now again, I know as a general audience you already know almost all of this or more.
[01:16:12.978 --> 01:16:15.139]  A lot of you had friends and family take the shot and get sick or die.
[01:16:15.179 --> 01:16:16.440]  You don't need me telling you all day about it.
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:19.361]  But we've got millions of new people all the time tuning in every week.
[01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:21.142]  We've got to warn them and save them.
[01:16:21.542 --> 01:16:35.990]  Because the globalists, just by wounding these people, even if you don't care about them because they're idiot leftists, they'll now be a drain on society and force society to accept eugenics, accept society, get society to accept euthanasia, all of this.
[01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:47.917]   And by the way, before I left for a week to spend time with family and recharge my batteries, I said I was going to take a notebook and write notes about what the globals are going to do next, how I see it all tied together, and how we counter them.
[01:16:48.417 --> 01:16:49.358]  I wrote a lot of notes.
[01:16:50.118 --> 01:17:25.616]   I wrote more than 30 pages of notes, and I haven't had a time to sit down on a word processor and type it all up and really go over it, but I intend Very soon, maybe next week, maybe the week after, to actually put together a PowerPoint-type presentation so that I can get up here and really lay out what they've done, what they're doing, what they're about to do, and then how they're going to use the crises they've orchestrated and implemented and exacerbated to bring in even greater crises and an artificial, limited end of the world, which they then blame on the general public.
[01:17:26.644 --> 01:17:31.427]  You can't get more cutting edge, more deep, more important than this information.
[01:17:32.108 --> 01:17:34.790]  And so, I'm going to codify all this.
[01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:35.891]  A lot of it you've already heard.
[01:17:35.911 --> 01:17:36.651]  A lot of it you already know.
[01:17:36.671 --> 01:17:37.472]  A lot of it you don't.
[01:17:37.892 --> 01:17:39.233]  A lot of this is next level.
[01:17:39.773 --> 01:17:41.435]  Nobody else has talked about this.
[01:17:41.455 --> 01:17:42.916]  Nobody else understands this.
[01:17:43.416 --> 01:17:44.817]  We're known for being decades ahead.
[01:17:44.857 --> 01:17:47.539]  You're about to get... I'm going to shoot forward.
[01:17:47.619 --> 01:17:49.540]  Not just to what we're going to do next year or the year after that.
[01:17:49.901 --> 01:17:50.621]  I'm going to cover that.
[01:17:50.681 --> 01:17:53.923]  I'm going to shoot forward 10, 20 years if it's successful.
[01:17:55.069 --> 01:17:56.170]  For future groups.
[01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:58.931]  Because I've got ways to beat them in the future.
[01:17:58.951 --> 01:18:02.353]  I know moves, if they're successful right now, that'll beat them in the future.
[01:18:02.613 --> 01:18:06.035]  Because by then, whoever's still alive will really be listening then.
[01:18:06.495 --> 01:18:07.135]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:07.175 --> 01:18:07.555]  Stay with us.
[01:18:08.876 --> 01:18:10.777]  Infowars can see for miles.
[01:18:12.978 --> 01:18:14.179]  And miles.
[01:18:18.161 --> 01:18:19.581]  And miles.
[01:18:21.462 --> 01:18:33.197]   In the near future, I'm going to take you to the year 2100.
[01:18:32.297 --> 01:18:33.197]  If they have their plans.
[01:18:34.338 --> 01:18:35.619]  What their actual dreams are.
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:40.642]  And how it's really going to unfold on different paths.
[01:18:45.505 --> 01:18:49.907]  Because we can see for miles and miles and miles and miles.
[01:18:52.169 --> 01:18:53.229]  Okay, let's jump into it.
[01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:58.557]   If you go back three years ago, At the end of this month, it'll be three years.
[01:19:00.179 --> 01:19:12.168]  And we specifically said what the shots would do, how they destroy your immune system, how they give you cancer, how they reignite and reactivate cancers, how they give you myocarditis and blood clots and heart attacks and strokes and everything else.
[01:19:12.628 --> 01:19:13.389]  Attack your fertility.
[01:19:13.409 --> 01:19:16.131]  It was in all the documents.
[01:19:17.012 --> 01:19:19.293]  But you gotta ask, why would they do something like that?
[01:19:19.333 --> 01:19:22.196]  Well, to corrupt the media and have them sign on to evil.
[01:19:22.975 --> 01:19:28.121]  Knowing human nature during a corrupt phase would be to just double down and deny it and accept something even more evil.
[01:19:28.521 --> 01:19:29.803]  It's a beta test for mass death.
[01:19:30.083 --> 01:19:39.517]   And to get the doctors and nurses and medical companies and governments to sign indemnities to Pfizer and Moderna, pledging The National Parks.
[01:19:39.697 --> 01:19:40.658]  This came out of Brazil.
[01:19:40.698 --> 01:19:43.600]  They wanted to pledge the National Parks and Military Bases there.
[01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:52.326]  Turned out in Europe they pledged the National Parks and Military Bases and the National Parks and Military Bases if the emergency authorization shot didn't work and hurt people.
[01:19:52.506 --> 01:19:55.749]  Well, they'd already tested it on rats and knew it didn't work and made them sick!
[01:19:57.796 --> 01:19:58.877]  That's just one level.
[01:19:58.917 --> 01:20:00.318]  It goes on and on and on and on.
[01:20:00.438 --> 01:20:11.869]  How that then breaks down society, how it bankrupts the government, how it discredits the government, how it makes an angrier world, how it causes division, how it destroys trust, and how it collapses society, which is what they want, a post-industrial world!
[01:20:13.931 --> 01:20:19.516]  Driving back from Big Bend, National Park, and I also spent time at the State Park, it was amazing, one of my favorite places to go.
[01:20:19.836 --> 01:20:20.597]  Great people down there.
[01:20:21.557 --> 01:20:22.718]  Like, all listeners, basically.
[01:20:23.719 --> 01:20:24.300]  Talk about awake.
[01:20:27.014 --> 01:20:35.599]  I listened to a couple Jordan Peterson podcasts, and the guy's really smart and well-spoken, and what he talks about is accurate and true.
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:49.648]  Except he stops, and says the globalists are dumb and are wrong, and just don't like capitalism, and they're just not as smart as those of us that don't want to ban the farms, and don't want to shut down the cattle production.
[01:20:49.848 --> 01:20:51.209]  No, they want to starve everybody!
[01:20:51.409 --> 01:20:52.429]  They want to depopulate us!
[01:20:52.449 --> 01:20:53.390]  They're not stupid!
[01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:54.631]  They admit it's a plan!
[01:20:57.369 --> 01:20:59.790]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:08.534]  It's like... Adam Carolla was on Fox saying, I want prosecution of the people that gave us the poison shots.
[01:21:08.954 --> 01:21:09.975]  And I want them to get in trouble.
[01:21:10.315 --> 01:21:14.377]  Because even though they didn't know it would hurt people, they bet on it and their bet killed people.
[01:21:14.637 --> 01:21:15.697]  So now they need to get in trouble.
[01:21:15.957 --> 01:21:19.679]  They knew the damn shot killed the frickin' rats!
[01:21:20.519 --> 01:21:26.042]  It killed, it cut their life expectancies at the University of Texas, not just to study.
[01:21:27.418 --> 01:21:35.760]  But a National Centers for Disease Control, NIH National Initiative.
[01:21:37.001 --> 01:21:41.982]  An initiative is like the drug war or the Manhattan Project.
[01:21:42.102 --> 01:21:52.185]  An initiative is an all-hands-on-deck, all major universities that get government funding, what Eisenhower warned of, the technotronic, technological elite controlling military industrial complex.
[01:21:52.485 --> 01:21:58.795]   It was an all-hands-on-deck, National Initiative with Fauci's name on the documents.
[01:21:58.835 --> 01:22:00.876]  I've shown this probably 10 times on air.
[01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:03.618]  I should dig it back up from two and a half years ago and show it to you again.
[01:22:03.818 --> 01:22:05.559]  People are saying, how do you know it's going to kill us?
[01:22:05.779 --> 01:22:07.060]  How do you know it's going to cause blood clots?
[01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:08.461]  How do you know it's going to cause infertility?
[01:22:08.641 --> 01:22:19.607]  Because they did a COVID coronavirus chimera test over four years during Obama from 2000 and eight or so till 2014.
[01:22:19.727 --> 01:22:21.768]  I guess it was longer than that, six years.
[01:22:26.573 --> 01:22:29.014]  And they found what it is, the mice and the rats.
[01:22:30.835 --> 01:22:44.121]  So they then go cook it up, and even Glenn Beck exposed to the documents how months before they released the coronavirus, they'd already ordered Moderna, Pfizer, J&J, and AstraZeneca to start making the damn shot for COVID-19 in the documents.
[01:22:44.301 --> 01:22:46.822]  They even left the real name of the frickin' thing on there.
[01:22:48.783 --> 01:22:49.423]  I'm getting angry.
[01:22:49.463 --> 01:22:50.623]  Please control yourself, Johnson.
[01:22:52.004 --> 01:22:54.125]  So, that's where we are.
[01:22:55.476 --> 01:23:01.170]  And they wanted to test the censorship, test the surveillance, bring in the control grid.
[01:23:01.450 --> 01:23:05.360]  This was just a dress rehearsal and it's still a dangerous virus and the shot's 10 times worse.
[01:23:09.195 --> 01:23:10.175]  These are megalomaniacs.
[01:23:10.235 --> 01:23:12.936]  And the good news is, this hasn't gone the way they wanted.
[01:23:13.076 --> 01:23:14.436]  They lost their censorship battle.
[01:23:14.716 --> 01:23:15.917]  But they're not going to give up.
[01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:17.377]  They're going to release more deadly viruses.
[01:23:17.577 --> 01:23:19.618]  And they're doing drills of that being imminent.
[01:23:19.818 --> 01:23:22.018]  And they're laughing and giggling and getting ready for it.
[01:23:22.258 --> 01:23:24.199]  And Lord knows what they're going to release next.
[01:23:24.559 --> 01:23:29.860]  Most of the inside baseball from high-level folks, they won't tell me it's super classified information.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:34.281]  They just say they have a feeling it's going to be hemorrhagic fever airborne.
[01:23:35.662 --> 01:23:36.802]  Airborne Ebola.
[01:23:37.637 --> 01:23:39.718]  So yeah, I'm a little bit desperate.
[01:23:39.958 --> 01:23:41.099]  Yeah, I'm a little bit concerned.
[01:23:41.319 --> 01:23:42.939]  Yeah, I'm a little bit on the edge of my seat here.
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:45.561]  Because I love my family.
[01:23:45.641 --> 01:23:46.461]  I love my children.
[01:23:46.561 --> 01:23:47.441]  I love you.
[01:23:47.502 --> 01:23:51.103]  We're all in this together and the new world order is coming down on us right now.
[01:23:53.364 --> 01:23:54.064]  Look at these headlines.
[01:23:54.465 --> 01:23:58.386]  New Zealand's preparing to administer unapproved monkeypox vaccine.
[01:23:58.446 --> 01:23:59.447]  Infowars.com.
[01:24:02.779 --> 01:24:07.509]  Now they're saying they're going to give unapproved cancer vaccines and unapproved flu vaccines that aren't vaccines.
[01:24:07.549 --> 01:24:11.056]  They're mRNA gene manipulating programs.
[01:24:13.592 --> 01:24:16.614]  And then there's this video, we'll get to it later when we have time, but Roger Stone's coming up.
[01:24:17.095 --> 01:24:26.582]  FDA in their virtual meeting yesterday says they were falsely misled, close quote, by Pfizer about the safety of the vaccine and that heart attacks are 71% higher than other vaccines.
[01:24:26.802 --> 01:24:29.724]  The vaccines are killing two people for every one life saved.
[01:24:30.305 --> 01:24:32.567]  Funny the CDC admits other vaccines cause heart attacks.
[01:24:32.787 --> 01:24:32.987]  Yeah.
[01:24:33.547 --> 01:24:40.152]  They fool your body to think there's a viral attack, and most heart attacks are caused not by plaques or things being clogged, but by viral infections.
[01:24:41.152 --> 01:24:44.375]  The whole video, hours of it, from the CDC is linked right there.
[01:24:46.818 --> 01:24:48.760]  Go watch the CDC say we were deceived.
[01:24:49.321 --> 01:24:51.063]  Oh, but if you try to say that, you've got to be censored.
[01:24:55.086 --> 01:24:58.689]  Cover-related tech was exploited for mass surveillance just as we were warned.
[01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:59.769]  Of course it was.
[01:24:59.789 --> 01:25:01.651]  It was all a rollout for that worldwide system.
[01:25:02.371 --> 01:25:13.759]  All these mothers sending in injector newborn babies and laughing at anti-vaxxers mindlessly and groups of teachers and medical workers on TV saying the vaccine's totally safe and no one's ever gotten hurt and there's no side effects.
[01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:16.541]  Lying to you.
[01:25:16.561 --> 01:25:18.462]  I'm going to play these clips next segment ahead of Roger.
[01:25:19.543 --> 01:25:33.401]   But remember, even the Times of London reported army spies to take on anti-vax Militants going back over two years ago using army PSYOPs in every major country to scare the public into submission.
[01:25:33.741 --> 01:25:44.570]  COVID PSYOP exposed network of doctors who pushed masking lockdowns on Twitter during pandemic did not exist and were hired by a PR company connected to the Pentagon.
[01:25:48.613 --> 01:25:49.053]  The U.S.
[01:25:49.073 --> 01:25:50.835]  keeps offering China its COVID vaccines.
[01:25:51.155 --> 01:25:52.416]  China keeps saying no.
[01:25:52.756 --> 01:25:53.317]  Wonder why?
[01:25:55.014 --> 01:25:58.795]  This is good versus evil, period.
[01:26:00.555 --> 01:26:02.116]  And these people know exactly what they're doing.
[01:26:02.376 --> 01:26:14.859]  Bill Gates says to prepare for the next pandemic, governments across the world should increase spending on a global surveillance team through the UN that tells the countries via the treaty how to respond in a medical emergency.
[01:26:14.879 --> 01:26:15.819]  And who controls the UN?
[01:26:16.119 --> 01:26:19.540]  Bill Gates and his criminal consortium with total surveillance.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:22.541]  Greta Thunberg says there's no back to normal normal.
[01:26:23.991 --> 01:26:29.854]  Was the system what gave us climate crisis and a system of colonialism, imperialism, oppression, genocide, and racist oppressive?
[01:26:30.994 --> 01:26:31.615]  And it goes on.
[01:26:32.475 --> 01:26:34.096]  Run by the very same big banks today.
[01:26:36.057 --> 01:26:37.197]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:26:37.557 --> 01:26:40.479]  I've got so much more in this stack, but Roger's coming up.
[01:26:41.339 --> 01:26:42.840]  And I want to play in that little short segment.
[01:26:44.019 --> 01:26:49.006]  These clips of these parents and nurses and people pushing the poison shots, that's all coming up.
[01:26:49.406 --> 01:27:01.041]  We're going to cover the Ukraine war, what happened in Congress last week with Roger, some really amazing JFK information about President Nixon, it's his birthday today, and so much more next hour.
[01:27:02.699 --> 01:27:06.720]  And we're also going to focus on the IRS, what we already knew, but now it's confirmed.
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:11.981]  Those 86,000 new IRS agents are to target working class people making less than $40,000 a year.
[01:27:12.421 --> 01:27:15.862]  If you want to wreck a society, you target the working poor.
[01:27:17.583 --> 01:27:21.484]  With inflation now $40,000 a year, as a single person, you can live okay.
[01:27:21.664 --> 01:27:22.584]  With kids, you're poor.
[01:27:24.082 --> 01:27:29.464]  And they want to destroy those people and run them into the ground to force you onto welfare and collapse society.
[01:27:29.504 --> 01:27:30.344]  It's in all the plans.
[01:27:30.624 --> 01:27:31.965]  It's the post-industrial world.
[01:27:32.005 --> 01:27:32.945]  It's the angrier world.
[01:27:33.385 --> 01:27:36.486]  I know they're trying to make it harder for everybody to shut down independent media.
[01:27:36.866 --> 01:27:41.548]  That's why I know it's a sacrifice to support InfoWars, but I'm asking all of you to realize we're essential.
[01:27:41.808 --> 01:27:42.929]  This information is essential.
[01:27:42.949 --> 01:27:44.209]  We've saved a lot of lives together.
[01:27:44.489 --> 01:27:45.890]  So please go to InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:27:45.930 --> 01:27:50.291]  You can make one-time or repeated donations right there on the site or buy great products.
[01:27:50.711 --> 01:27:51.872]  We're going to have to stop the sale.
[01:27:51.912 --> 01:27:56.032]   It will end tomorrow, a vitamin mineral fusion DNA force plus for 50% off because they're
[01:27:56.032 --> 01:27:57.032]  about to sell out.
[01:27:57.032 --> 01:28:00.032]  Also, down and out sleep support, our strongest formula.
[01:28:00.032 --> 01:28:14.791]   It's back in stock 50% off and real red pill selling out but still 50% off at info or store.com.
[01:28:14.791 --> 01:28:18.832]   Taping this important announcement on the afternoon of Thursday, January 5th.
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:28.002]  And that means we've only got four days to act if you want to get Vitamin Mineral Fusion and DNA Force Plus both at 50% off.
[01:28:28.042 --> 01:28:32.143]  Next Monday, the products are going back to full price because they're close to selling out.
[01:28:32.443 --> 01:28:34.163]  We won't have more back in stock for months.
[01:28:34.723 --> 01:28:37.604]  Everybody should be on Vitamin Mineral Fusion and DNA Force Plus.
[01:28:38.004 --> 01:28:41.866]  Just look at DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ10 and so much more.
[01:28:42.206 --> 01:28:50.209]  Documented to clean out your cells, your mitochondria, take your immune system to the next level, and even have your telomeres, that's your DNA, last longer.
[01:28:50.610 --> 01:28:53.891]  This is the opposite of what the globalists are doing with their poison shots.
[01:28:54.171 --> 01:28:57.533]  This is actually giving your body the tools it needs to regenerate.
[01:28:57.913 --> 01:29:02.395]  Get DNA Force Plus and Vitaminal Fusion for a limited time for 50% off.
[01:29:02.455 --> 01:29:07.116]   You've got until next Monday and Your purchase supports the broadcast.

[01:29:16.718 --> 01:29:17.938]  Five and up.
[01:29:18.238 --> 01:29:19.019]  Starting next week.
[01:29:19.559 --> 01:29:20.659]  It's great news.
[01:29:21.239 --> 01:29:26.240]  And as soon as these guys can get it too, all bets are off.
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:27.880]  You anti-vaxxers.
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.000]  All bets are off.
[01:29:30.201 --> 01:29:31.161]  All bets are off.
[01:29:32.478 --> 01:29:40.406]  Yeah, if I, if I, um, if I can spread it, like, unknowingly after that, um, I'm gonna sneak on ya.
[01:29:40.686 --> 01:29:42.768]  A lot of ya.
[01:29:42.788 --> 01:29:43.269]  A lot of you.
[01:29:43.549 --> 01:29:44.189]  All bets are off.
[01:29:44.230 --> 01:29:44.890]  Cause we're all done.
[01:29:45.351 --> 01:29:46.111]  We're all done with you.
[01:29:46.552 --> 01:29:52.277]  So as soon as these guys can be safe, screw the rest of you.
[01:29:52.297 --> 01:29:53.859]  Screw the rest of you.
[01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:55.360]  Cause we're done.
[01:29:56.441 --> 01:29:56.802]  We're done.
[01:29:58.257 --> 01:29:58.438]  Yeah.
[01:29:58.979 --> 01:29:59.521]  Yeah.
[01:29:59.561 --> 01:30:01.607]  No, no more time.
[01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:02.931]  Done.
[01:30:03.552 --> 01:30:05.117]  Bad thing is, some of your kids will die.
[01:30:05.438 --> 01:30:06.140]  But I hope they don't.
[01:30:08.155 --> 01:30:13.937]  There was Alpha, then Delta, then Omicron next!
[01:30:14.277 --> 01:30:19.539]  But this latest variant might be the best!
[01:30:19.779 --> 01:30:21.239]  It's XBB.1.5!
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:24.661]  Another brand of COVID-19 has arrived!
[01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:28.282]  It's a new strain, but it isn't the same!
[01:30:28.782 --> 01:30:31.643]  Sounds more like Elon Musk, his name!
[01:30:32.003 --> 01:30:38.868]  It's XBB.1.5, not UB40 who sings Red Red Wine.
[01:30:39.469 --> 01:30:42.491]  Put on your mask when you're inside a facility.
[01:30:42.851 --> 01:30:48.496]  It could be a robot from a Star Wars trilogy.
[01:30:48.756 --> 01:30:56.522]  It's XBB.1.5, not OMG or MP3 or DCBY or an eye chart made by a really high guy.
[01:30:56.542 --> 01:30:59.644]  Sounds like the password of your parents' Wi-Fi.
[01:30:59.865 --> 01:31:00.285]  It's XBB.1.5.
[01:31:01.626 --> 01:31:02.466]  XDD.1.5!
[01:31:02.466 --> 01:31:05.186]  XDD.1.5!
[01:31:05.186 --> 01:31:11.065]  (audience cheering)
[01:31:11.065 --> 01:31:15.385]   Want to know what the Pede Squad thinks about the COVID vaccines for kids under 5?
[01:31:15.154 --> 01:31:15.714]  Relief!
[01:31:16.034 --> 01:31:16.774]  Happiness!
[01:31:16.814 --> 01:31:17.474]  Excitement!
[01:31:17.514 --> 01:31:21.396]  Children under 5 will most likely be able to get their vaccines starting next week!
[01:31:21.416 --> 01:31:28.939]  This will make a huge difference to families who have been mitigating risk over the past two years, just trying to keep their families and loved ones safe.
[01:31:28.999 --> 01:31:34.101]  While it's true that most young children will not suffer from severe outcomes due to COVID, many children have.
[01:31:34.181 --> 01:31:37.302]  Long-term effects of COVID on growing bodies are unknown.
[01:31:37.542 --> 01:31:41.202]  For this reason, the benefits of vaccinating young children outweighs the risk.
[01:31:41.982 --> 01:31:44.023]  But which vaccine is better?
[01:31:44.083 --> 01:31:50.364]  Both Pfizer and Moderna induced a robust antibody response, which correlates to protection against symptomatic and severe disease.
[01:31:50.664 --> 01:31:56.385]  Both vaccines were found to be safe, with zero cases of myocarditis reported in either trial.
[01:31:56.665 --> 01:31:57.625]  So what would we choose?
[01:31:57.805 --> 01:32:02.066]  Basically, we're recommending any vaccine that works for your personal situation and that you can have access to.
[01:32:03.786 --> 01:32:08.129]  In a minute, I'm in need of vaccination for my children to protect them.
[01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:12.531]  These women have Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:32:12.551 --> 01:32:13.932]  They think the state is their daddy.
[01:32:14.852 --> 01:32:17.173]  When really, it's their Ted Bundy.
[01:32:19.434 --> 01:32:20.895]  Roger Stone is loaded for bear.
[01:32:20.955 --> 01:32:25.558]  You know, he was a very close confidant of Richard Nixon in his administration right from the time he died.
[01:32:25.578 --> 01:32:31.325]   He's been breaking his silence about JFK assassination and what Nixon told him.
[01:32:31.345 --> 01:32:34.167]  We're going to talk about Nixon on his 109th birthday today.
[01:32:34.187 --> 01:32:38.350]  Then we're going to look at what really happened last week that Roger Stone predicted.
[01:32:38.370 --> 01:32:39.611]  I've got our archivist trying to find it.
[01:32:39.631 --> 01:32:41.172]  He probably said it 10 times on the show.
[01:32:41.693 --> 01:32:45.075]  The six months leading up to the election, he said, I think they're going to lose the Senate.
[01:32:45.095 --> 01:32:46.016]  They're not going to keep the Senate.
[01:32:46.076 --> 01:32:46.837]  They already lost it.
[01:32:46.857 --> 01:32:47.557]  They're not going to gain it.
[01:32:47.898 --> 01:32:52.081]  And they're going to get a narrow majority in the House, maybe 15 to 25 votes.
[01:32:52.101 --> 01:32:52.341]  He nailed it.
[01:32:55.203 --> 01:33:02.467]  And he said that's actually a silver lining, because then if those are patriots, they will be able to control what happens.
[01:33:02.487 --> 01:33:06.108]  You just saw a major exercise in that last week.
[01:33:06.568 --> 01:33:12.931]  We're talking about what the agenda should be, what he's hearing is really about to happen, why Trump backed McCarthy, and more.
[01:33:12.971 --> 01:33:13.752]  But I'm just saying this.
[01:33:14.232 --> 01:33:14.892]  I love MTG.
[01:33:14.972 --> 01:33:15.973]  She stands up for free speech.
[01:33:15.993 --> 01:33:16.793]  It's a great voting record.
[01:33:17.634 --> 01:33:19.354]  Everybody's attacking her and all this stuff.
[01:33:20.635 --> 01:33:22.016]  She's no Dan Crenshaw, folks.
[01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:23.297]  Trump asked her to do this.
[01:33:23.638 --> 01:33:24.679]  She's loyal to Trump.
[01:33:25.159 --> 01:33:27.601]  So you can't be mad at her and then not be mad at Trump.
[01:33:27.661 --> 01:33:28.762]  I'm not mad at Trump about this.
[01:33:29.262 --> 01:33:30.163]  We're going to wait and see.
[01:33:30.263 --> 01:33:32.105]  But we better see impeachment filed.
[01:33:32.545 --> 01:33:33.826]  We better see a bunch of other stuff.
[01:33:33.866 --> 01:33:36.328]  And Roger Stone's going to talk about that coming up.
[01:33:36.388 --> 01:33:37.990]  Also, Bolsonaro moving to Florida.
[01:33:38.230 --> 01:33:39.151]  What's happening in Brazil.
[01:33:39.171 --> 01:33:45.516]  It is going to be a jam-packed third hour with the man himself, top political analyst, Roger Stone, straight ahead.
[01:33:45.556 --> 01:33:55.005]   And then We have the gun shop owner that sued and overturned Trump's bump stock man in studio in the fourth hour to talk Second Amendment and more.
[01:33:55.425 --> 01:33:59.109]  So a big third and fourth hour straight ahead.
[01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:02.352]  It's all coming out now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:03.593 --> 01:34:08.497]  Everything me and Roger Stone exposed six plus years ago.
[01:34:09.899 --> 01:34:15.317]   Because we can see for miles and miles We can see from miles and miles.
[01:34:16.158 --> 01:34:20.202]  Because Roger Stone for 50 years or longer has been immersed in politics.
[01:34:20.642 --> 01:34:23.265]  I've been immersed for 30 years, 28 years on air.
[01:34:23.705 --> 01:34:27.989]  And you learn a lot by trial and error doing research and actually having skim the game.
[01:34:29.235 --> 01:34:30.716]  It's all come out what we said is true.
[01:34:30.776 --> 01:34:43.481]  Trump was spied on, the whole Russiagate was fake, the CIA with the Justice Department was working with dinosaur media and big tech to censor all of it, election meddling, criminal activity, it is all coming out.
[01:34:44.782 --> 01:34:54.946]   And we look at the Church Committee back in the late 70s, exposing some of what Nixon did, and Nixon would blush at what has now currently been done.
[01:34:54.946 --> 01:34:57.746]  I think Richard Nixon overall was a good American.
[01:34:57.746 --> 01:34:59.746]  I think he cared about the country.
[01:34:59.746 --> 01:35:03.186]   And he certainly did a lot of things I agree with, a lot of things I disagree with.
[01:35:03.186 --> 01:35:07.186]   But boy, we do a lot better today with a Richard Nixon versus what we have.
[01:35:07.186 --> 01:35:12.626]   And Rogers talked about some of the intimate things that Nixon told him.
[01:35:12.768 --> 01:35:15.151]  They were confidants until Nixon died.
[01:35:15.491 --> 01:35:18.134]  But he was also in the Nixon administration as a young man.
[01:35:18.695 --> 01:35:20.878]  The only quote non-indicted plumber.
[01:35:21.198 --> 01:35:22.820]  The Rogers will say he wasn't a plumber.
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:24.922]  So a living piece of history.
[01:35:25.743 --> 01:35:27.886]  Not just from January 6th or getting Trump elected.
[01:35:28.366 --> 01:35:55.967]   This is Roger Stone here with us to talk about the new JFK files coming out, to talk about Nixon on his 110th birthday, I got that wrong, it's 109th, and the next segment we'll get into all of the huge developments last week in Congress and what's really about to happen from Roger Stone's crystal ball because remember he predicted many times in the lead up to the last election that the Republicans would not retake the Senate, it would
[01:35:55.967 --> 01:35:59.777]   barely hold onto the House, but there was a silver lining in that. So Roger Stone is
[01:35:59.777 --> 01:36:03.777]   here to cover all of this and more. Bolsonaro in the hospital in Florida, what's
[01:36:03.777 --> 01:36:07.197]  happening over there right now in Brazil.
[01:36:07.197 --> 01:36:11.197]   We're going to cover the waterfront in the next 50 minutes with the great Roger Stone,
[01:36:11.197 --> 01:36:16.077]   who of course has the excellent website stonezone.com and his own program,
[01:36:16.077 --> 01:36:19.277]  Weekday Evenings on Free Speech TV, that is exploding.
[01:36:19.422 --> 01:36:21.264]  It was already popular, but I'm getting a little jealous now.
[01:36:21.644 --> 01:36:22.505]  It is exploding.
[01:36:22.765 --> 01:36:28.569]  So, Roger, congratulations on so many fronts and being exonerated on January 6th, along with myself and so many others.
[01:36:28.789 --> 01:36:29.410]  Great to have you here.
[01:36:30.974 --> 01:36:33.056]  Alex, it's great to be here.
[01:36:33.716 --> 01:36:40.422]  As you point out, it is the 110th birthday of my political mentor, Richard Nixon.
[01:36:41.082 --> 01:36:44.385]  And Richard Nixon did, as you pointed out, many great things.
[01:36:44.425 --> 01:36:46.447]  He ended the war in Vietnam.
[01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:51.266]   He reached a strategic arms limitation agreement with the Soviets.
[01:36:51.266 --> 01:36:57.106]   He unilaterally saved Israel from destruction in the Yom Kippur War of 1973.
[01:36:57.106 --> 01:37:00.706]  He desegregated the public schools without violence.
[01:37:00.706 --> 01:37:02.987]  He gave us the 18-year-old vote.
[01:37:02.987 --> 01:37:05.947]  He did away with the military draft.
[01:37:05.947 --> 01:37:11.546]   He also made some egregious mistakes, taking us off the gold standard, an enormous mistake,
[01:37:11.546 --> 01:37:14.947]  perhaps his biggest mistake.
[01:37:14.947 --> 01:37:20.985]   Those who say, "Well, he opened the door to China," yes, but China was a backwards, dirt-poor,
[01:37:20.985 --> 01:37:29.186]   agrarian society with more ox than they had cars when he recognized them in 1972.
[01:37:29.186 --> 01:37:35.266]   It wasn't until the Bushes gave them most favored trading nation status and Bill Clinton
[01:37:35.266 --> 01:37:42.067]   gave them all of our military secrets, including selling them the technology for
[01:37:42.235 --> 01:37:49.275]   guided intercontinental ballistic missiles, that they became the dangerous
[01:37:49.275 --> 01:37:51.914]  world power that they are today.
[01:37:51.914 --> 01:37:56.715]   The important thing for people to realize, Alex, and you know this is, the same people
[01:37:56.715 --> 01:37:57.594]  who killed John F.
[01:37:57.594 --> 01:38:03.675]   Kennedy, the same people who killed Robert Kennedy, the same people who tried to take
[01:38:03.675 --> 01:38:08.635]  down Donald Trump, these were all the same people.
[01:38:08.672 --> 01:38:13.575]  It was the military industrial complex, better known as the Deep State.
[01:38:13.595 --> 01:38:18.079]  It was the Democratic Party mainstream media cabal.
[01:38:18.879 --> 01:38:25.184]  And as you point out, Nixon himself revealed a number of startling truths to me before his death.
[01:38:27.478 --> 01:38:28.279]  Those are huge.
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:33.125]  You talked a little bit about it in the international news, what he said about Kennedy after the assassination.
[01:38:33.686 --> 01:38:34.567]  But let's go further.
[01:38:34.627 --> 01:38:37.971]  Give us some never-before-known confidant moments with Richard Nixon.
[01:38:39.566 --> 01:38:42.428]  Well, I think that you make reference to the most important one.
[01:38:42.468 --> 01:38:47.451]  Now, Nixon was a man who was not at all, you know, retrospective.
[01:38:47.511 --> 01:38:49.092]  He was very introspective.
[01:38:49.393 --> 01:38:51.634]  He was also very, very forward looking.
[01:38:51.894 --> 01:38:58.773]   So normally speaking, it was hard to get him to talk about Dwight Eisenhower, Joe McCarthy, Jack Kennedy,
[01:38:58.773 --> 01:39:06.873]   Alger Hiss, you know, being stoned in Caracas, his confrontations with Nikita Khrushchev.
[01:39:06.873 --> 01:39:12.273]   But when he had a couple of cocktails, he became positively loquacious.
[01:39:12.273 --> 01:39:20.494]   So in 19, I guess it was '98, we were sitting in his apartment in New York City,
[01:39:20.494 --> 01:39:24.653]  And he made a couple of what he called his silver bullets.
[01:39:24.755 --> 01:39:29.737]  You can find the recipe for Richard Nixon's ice cold martinis in my book, Stones Rules.
[01:39:30.397 --> 01:39:39.740]  He mixed up a couple of them for us, and we're sitting there drinking, and after he had begun his second one, I asked him, Mr. President, who really killed John Kennedy?
[01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:42.370]  He looked deeply in his drink.
[01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:48.655]  He looked up and he said, well, first of all, the Warren Commission was the biggest goddamn hoax in American history.
[01:39:49.276 --> 01:39:51.958]  And I said, yeah, but who really killed Kennedy?
[01:39:52.678 --> 01:39:54.440]  And he said, let me put it to you this way.
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:57.342]  Lyndon and I both wanted to be president.
[01:39:57.402 --> 01:40:00.244]  The difference was I wouldn't kill for it.
[01:40:01.365 --> 01:40:02.426]  There you have it.
[01:40:03.006 --> 01:40:22.009]   Now, Alex, the other thing that's interesting is just days ago, or I should say weeks ago, Watergate tape surfaced, which is a conversation between Richard Nixon and CIA Director Richard Helms.
[01:40:22.689 --> 01:40:39.143]  Now the walls are closing in on Nixon on Watergate, and he says to Helms, essentially threatening him, now Dick, you know, if things get bad, there's going to be a lot of these things under examination, such as who shot John and so on.
[01:40:40.137 --> 01:40:40.817]  There you have it.
[01:40:41.837 --> 01:40:57.402]  Basically, Nixon is telling Helms that if the agency will protect Nixon in Watergate, Nixon won't spill their biggest secret, which is the CIA's direct involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
[01:40:58.082 --> 01:41:06.204]  This is a little-known tape, but there was an excellent article on it in Politico, of all places, roughly a month ago.
[01:41:06.923 --> 01:41:15.804]   So it is really kind of interesting as we fast forward to today's politics that we see
[01:41:15.804 --> 01:41:25.043]   the same cabal, the same evil forces who were trying to kill John Kennedy because Kennedy
[01:41:25.043 --> 01:41:30.524]   was not committed to nuclear war with the Russians, because Kennedy was insisting on
[01:41:30.524 --> 01:41:36.643]   a gold or in his preference silver backed dollar, because Kennedy had said that he didn't
[01:41:36.643 --> 01:41:37.643]  trust the CIA.
[01:41:37.643 --> 01:41:44.283]   In fact, after the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he said he would smash the CIA into a million
[01:41:44.283 --> 01:41:46.603]  pieces and scatter it to the wind.
[01:41:46.603 --> 01:41:51.962]   And of course, weeks later, he was brutally murdered in the streets of Dallas.
[01:41:51.962 --> 01:41:54.962]  So but it is not at all different.
[01:41:54.962 --> 01:42:01.724]   The same people who conjured up the Russian collusion hoax for which I suffered mightily,
[01:42:01.724 --> 01:42:03.323]  the same people who are.
[01:42:03.476 --> 01:42:14.123]  Leaning on Twitter to censor any narrative that is not the official narrative of the Democrat fake news media cabal.
[01:42:14.444 --> 01:42:16.465]  These are all the same people.
[01:42:16.865 --> 01:42:26.672]  And I might say the same people relentlessly pushing the false narrative regarding the safety and the effectiveness of the COVID-19 shot.
[01:42:27.012 --> 01:42:28.013]  It's all the same folks.
[01:42:28.573 --> 01:42:29.733]  Well, it absolutely is.
[01:42:29.753 --> 01:42:38.135]  When we come back, let's continue with Kennedy, because the same cabals, the same permanent state, the same deep state, has been passing power down to their children and others.
[01:42:38.495 --> 01:42:40.595]  It's the neocons, the Democrats, working at the top.
[01:42:40.916 --> 01:42:43.116]  They've never been weaker as they are right now.
[01:42:43.176 --> 01:42:45.517]  It's come out how they're surveilling, how they're censoring.
[01:42:45.577 --> 01:42:51.598]  But people, a lot of people don't know, you are also one of the most famous JFK researchers, unless you're in that community.
[01:42:51.978 --> 01:42:52.638]  People don't know.
[01:42:52.718 --> 01:42:57.139]  I met you more than 10 years ago at a JFK event in Dallas.
[01:42:57.819 --> 01:43:12.008]  Where I was also there speaking and attending and this is a big deal to understand the trajectory of the deep state and how they took over to this moment is that's really where the full coup against the Republic happens is in Dealey Plaza in 1963.
[01:43:13.389 --> 01:43:18.953]  And I've interviewed and I've played the tape of the man that actually ran the assassination operation.
[01:43:19.173 --> 01:43:20.214]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[01:43:21.246 --> 01:43:35.598]  More than 20 years ago, the National Archives released a speech that Kennedy had given in 1962, talking about conspiracies and organized criminal groups in our government and other governments.
[01:43:37.273 --> 01:43:45.855]  It was a few years after that they killed him, or a year and a half after that they killed him, and the CIA invented the term, this has been declassified in Congress, conspiracy theorists.
[01:43:45.895 --> 01:43:48.736]  That came out in the Senate Frank Church committee hearings.
[01:43:49.316 --> 01:43:53.897]  Don't debate the facts we have, just call them conspiracy theorists, or call them racists, or call them Russians.
[01:43:54.478 --> 01:43:58.279]  Here's a little bit of that speech where Kennedy warned about the conspiracy.
[01:43:58.299 --> 01:44:03.320]  I want to talk about our common responsibilities in the face of a common danger.
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:15.227]  The events of recent weeks may have helped to illuminate that challenge for some, but the dimensions of its threat have loomed large on the horizon for many years.
[01:44:16.228 --> 01:44:48.173]   The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society, and we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, And a secret proceedings posed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of elections
[01:44:49.048 --> 01:44:51.771]  On intimidation instead of free choice.
[01:44:52.552 --> 01:44:55.756]  On guerrillas by night instead of armies by day.
[01:44:55.776 --> 01:45:14.891]   It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, Highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific, and political operations.
[01:45:15.832 --> 01:45:18.613]  Its preparations are concealed, not published.
[01:45:19.293 --> 01:45:21.795]  Its mistakes are buried, not headlined.
[01:45:22.575 --> 01:45:25.237]  Its dissenters are silenced, not praised.
[01:45:26.017 --> 01:45:30.960]  No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:33.721]  It conducts the Cold War in short.
[01:45:34.462 --> 01:45:39.845]  With a wartime discipline, no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.
[01:45:41.566 --> 01:45:45.588]  Remarks of the President to the American Newspaper Publishers Association.
[01:45:45.608 --> 01:45:47.429]  Okay, so let's think about this.
[01:45:47.649 --> 01:45:48.670]  Let's think about this.
[01:45:50.759 --> 01:46:01.247]  This is Kennedy talking about communism, but it's the perfect description of the deep state globalists we now know actually helped put the communists in power with the British and U.S.
[01:46:01.287 --> 01:46:03.549]  intelligence in 1917.
[01:46:04.730 --> 01:46:11.276]  Roger Stone, please continue with the incredible information you're laying out about Richard Nixon and the Kennedy assassination.
[01:46:12.501 --> 01:46:18.947]  I think it's vitally important that people understand that John F. Kennedy, first of all, was an ardent anti-communist.
[01:46:19.427 --> 01:46:21.008]  He was not a liberal.
[01:46:21.829 --> 01:46:29.236]  He cut taxes and, as you know, a rising tide lifts all boats, so he was a tax-cutter.
[01:46:29.656 --> 01:46:31.237]  He was insisting on hard money.
[01:46:31.297 --> 01:46:33.279]  He wanted a silver-backed dollar.
[01:46:33.319 --> 01:46:36.399]   This is why the The banks hated him.
[01:46:36.399 --> 01:46:40.679]  He was very skeptical about the Bay of Pigs invasion.
[01:46:40.679 --> 01:46:49.958]   This was the invasion of Cuba by a band of Cuban dissidents propped up by the CIA.
[01:46:49.958 --> 01:46:56.418]   Little known to this day is the fact that the CIA plan, which had actually been conceived
[01:46:56.418 --> 01:47:04.698]   under Eisenhower in a working group chaired by Vice President Richard Nixon, included
[01:47:04.698 --> 01:47:12.859]   an air cover for the men storming the beach at the Bay of Pigs in Cuba from 29 Panamanian
[01:47:12.859 --> 01:47:18.019]   flagged bombers that were supposed to be flown by Cuban pilots.
[01:47:18.019 --> 01:47:25.339]   JFK only approved the entire Bay of Pigs operation on the condition that it be made to look like
[01:47:25.339 --> 01:47:34.779]   an indigenous Cuban uprising rather than a CIA/USA backed invasion.
[01:47:34.738 --> 01:47:53.785]  Little did JFK know that that air support was cancelled by Charles Cable, the number two man at the CIA, brother of Dallas man Earl Cable, who was very actively involved in the cover-up of who really killed John Kennedy.
[01:47:54.625 --> 01:48:03.048]  There's also the clash that JFK had with the intelligence agencies over the Cuban missile crisis.
[01:48:03.568 --> 01:48:15.344]  And now we have the new CIA documents that just came out two weeks ago that indeed we have Lee Harvey Oswald working with the FBI and the CIA, something that was always known and that Garrison had exposed.
[01:48:16.670 --> 01:48:18.431]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary.
[01:48:18.551 --> 01:48:31.215]  As you know, the JFK movie by Oliver Stone caused such an uproar in this country that the House was forced to form the House Select Committee on Assassinations.
[01:48:31.716 --> 01:48:34.057]  They re-examined the Kennedy assassination.
[01:48:34.557 --> 01:48:37.478]  They concluded that the Warren Commission was wrong.
[01:48:38.098 --> 01:48:46.846]  That Kennedy had been killed as a result of a conspiracy, they concluded most likely at the hands of organized crime.
[01:48:47.426 --> 01:48:49.508]  They were not entirely wrong.
[01:48:50.309 --> 01:48:53.511]  The JFK research community, as you know, is very divided.
[01:48:53.892 --> 01:49:04.581]  But the truth of the matter is that those who say it was the CIA, the FBI, the Secret Service that were in on the murder, they are correct.
[01:49:05.101 --> 01:49:13.586]  Those who say it was Big Texas Oil because Kennedy wanted to repeal the oil depletion allowance, they are also correct.
[01:49:13.947 --> 01:49:17.769]  Those who say it was organized crime, well, they're also correct.
[01:49:17.809 --> 01:49:27.655]  We know from the secret recordings in Chicago mob boss CMG Incana's jail cell that he was boasting about his role in the murder of Kennedy.
[01:49:28.736 --> 01:49:35.860]  It was also very clearly the bankers upset about Kennedy's demand for a silver-backed dollar.
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:36.681]  Exactly.
[01:49:36.701 --> 01:49:37.921]  He made a bunch of people mad.
[01:49:37.941 --> 01:49:47.648]  For people who don't know how intelligence agencies work, it was, and he actually got arrested that day, but they covered it up, it was E. Howard Hunt from the intel I have.
[01:49:48.856 --> 01:49:54.457]   that they later made a movie Mission Impossible about and all the rest of it, who'd been a sniper
[01:49:54.457 --> 01:49:57.936]  in World War II in China against the Japanese.
[01:49:57.936 --> 01:50:02.456]   He gave a deathbed confession to his son that he'd been there quarterbacking,
[01:50:02.456 --> 01:50:08.336]   that the CIA hired a bunch of foreign assassins, mafia people, you name it, who were good shots
[01:50:08.336 --> 01:50:11.296]   who killed a lot of people, so that they could have confusion there.
[01:50:11.296 --> 01:50:14.216]  If any one group got caught, it never led back.
[01:50:14.216 --> 01:50:19.296]   So the fact that intelligence agencies use cutouts and use decoys and all this is well known.
[01:50:19.296 --> 01:50:27.817]   Then I talked to Madeline Duncan Brown before she died, and she was on record LBJ's mistress.
[01:50:27.817 --> 01:50:28.856]  She on record lived with him.
[01:50:28.856 --> 01:50:30.336]  She on record had a son with him.
[01:50:30.336 --> 01:50:34.935]   And she said that LBJ came back from a meeting days before the Dallas assassination
[01:50:34.935 --> 01:50:38.096]   and said that son of a bitch Kennedy will never embarrass me again.
[01:50:37.729 --> 01:50:46.596]  And we know Nixon was at that meeting in Dallas, supposedly at a Coca-Cola convention, with them and wasn't part of it, was basically told what was coming.
[01:50:46.616 --> 01:50:47.257]  What do you know about that?
[01:50:48.813 --> 01:50:50.514]  That's absolutely accurate, Alex.
[01:50:50.534 --> 01:50:51.674]  There is some confusion.
[01:50:51.714 --> 01:51:02.939]  There was an afternoon reception at the home of a Dallas oil man who had given a lot of money to Nixon's past political campaigns, at which Nixon was present.
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:06.321]  So was J. Edgar Hoover, by the way, and that's now been proven.
[01:51:06.341 --> 01:51:08.642]  Yeah, they just so happened to be in a room before they killed Kennedy.
[01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:11.041]  Yeah, just coincidentally.
[01:51:11.081 --> 01:51:23.249]  But later that night, after midnight, LBJ meets with his inner circle at the same place, at the home of Clint Murchison, the oil man, and that's where they put the finishing touches on JFK's murder.
[01:51:24.190 --> 01:51:32.435]  He tells Madeline Brown, the night before the murder, tomorrow those Irish sons of bitches will never be a problem for me again.
[01:51:32.695 --> 01:51:33.116]  There it is.
[01:51:34.185 --> 01:51:38.647]  Absolutely, and you can go rent the room he really lived in at the Driscoll Hotel downtown.
[01:51:38.667 --> 01:51:43.810]  They're in the Cattleman Baron Suite, and that's where he lived with her, his mistress, and it's all right there.
[01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:46.211]  And then I got some inside baseball too.
[01:51:47.632 --> 01:51:51.133]  My grandmother, in college, dated LBJ's hitman.
[01:51:51.173 --> 01:51:53.774]  She almost married him, and he basically told her all about it as well.
[01:51:54.615 --> 01:51:55.735]  LBJ was killing people all the time.
[01:51:56.296 --> 01:51:57.356]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:57.656 --> 01:51:59.357]  My mom's mom, here in Austin, Texas.
[01:51:59.637 --> 01:52:00.178]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:00.198 --> 01:52:00.558]  Stay with us.
[01:52:01.890 --> 01:52:03.632]  All right, I'm a little late getting back on air.
[01:52:03.652 --> 01:52:13.122]  It's me and Roger on the break talking about him releasing stuff he's never told you before about Richard Nixon and the JFK assassination.
[01:52:13.663 --> 01:52:15.124]  But it's all coming out.
[01:52:16.005 --> 01:52:24.072]   You know, Roger Stone's been interviewed by a lot of folks about JFK and he's one of the foremost real experts because he was There when it was all going on and then thereafter with Nixon.
[01:52:24.532 --> 01:52:33.473]  But we should probably get him back on Tucker Carlson with the interviews he does for Fox Nation that are so big to really bust this thing wide open.
[01:52:34.173 --> 01:52:48.636]  Roger, let's finish up with JFK and the Deep State and then move into the Deep State today and the censorship of the Twitter files and everything coming out and then move into what happened last week with McCarthy and the silver lining that you predicted.
[01:52:50.445 --> 01:52:54.868]  Well, Alex, I think it's very important to kind of pull it all together here.
[01:52:54.908 --> 01:53:11.899]  So I have long believed that the common spoke between the CIA, the FBI, and the deep state, the bankers, Big Texas Oil, and organized crime is none other than Lyndon Baines Johnson.
[01:53:12.739 --> 01:53:27.468]  Johnson, as the Senate Majority Leader, takes the very rare step of appointing himself to the Subcommittee of Defense Appropriations, where the secret CIA and FBI black box budgets are prepared.
[01:53:27.808 --> 01:53:31.990]  Essentially, Lyndon Johnson is the paymaster for both agencies.
[01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:38.534]  His next-door neighbor, J. Edgar Hoover, the Johnson daughters refer to him as Uncle Edgar.
[01:53:39.115 --> 01:53:43.548]  Hoover knew that John F. Kennedy was going to retire him mandatorily in 1964.
[01:53:47.362 --> 01:53:58.544]  Hoover, who was a major power broker, and as you know, had blackmail evidence on every politician and political leader of both parties, was done if Kennedy survived.
[01:53:59.684 --> 01:54:08.986]  Johnson is the water carrier for big Texas oil, fighting the cancellation of the oil depletion allowance.
[01:54:09.386 --> 01:54:18.933]   Lyndon Johnson is also on the payroll of Carlos Marcello, the mobster who controls the Mafia in both Texas and Louisiana.
[01:54:19.293 --> 01:54:21.075]  In fact, a man named Jack Haufer.
[01:54:21.575 --> 01:54:23.377]  That goes back to bootlegging.
[01:54:23.397 --> 01:54:23.957]  I'll leave it at this.
[01:54:24.117 --> 01:54:26.139]  I know some of the LBJ family here in Austin.
[01:54:26.459 --> 01:54:36.989]  They openly talk about the fact that LBJ was basically the head of what became the Dixie Mafia in Texas, Arkansas, through the South, throughout all that period for the Mafia.
[01:54:37.009 --> 01:54:38.190]  He was basically a member of the Mafia.
[01:54:39.461 --> 01:54:42.303]  And then here's a great story which I've never told previously.
[01:54:42.323 --> 01:54:45.545]  You made reference to Madeline Brown.
[01:54:45.565 --> 01:54:50.208]  Now, Madeline Brown was, without any question, Lyndon Johnson's mistress.
[01:54:51.108 --> 01:54:52.369]  She bore him a son.
[01:54:52.729 --> 01:54:56.612]  The son bore an amazing resemblance to LBJ.
[01:54:57.152 --> 01:55:18.121]   She very famously said both when she shacked up with Johnson in a Fort Worth, Texas hotel The night before the assassination, she says both that evening and the following morning, he reaffirmed that after that day, the 23rd, pardon me, the 22nd, that Kennedy would no longer be a political problem.
[01:55:18.821 --> 01:55:25.403]  I learned about this by watching a terrific interview with Madeleine Brown conducted by Geraldo Rivera.
[01:55:26.110 --> 01:55:46.380]  Many years later, I happened to be in a green room at Fox in New York City with the great Geraldo Rivera, and I told him how much I admired his work and how that particular interview had motivated me to write my book, The Man Who Killed Kennedy, The Case Against LBJ.
[01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:50.082]  He looked at me with a blank stare and he said, I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:55:50.695 --> 01:55:52.397]  I said, well, it's still on YouTube.
[01:55:52.417 --> 01:55:53.979]  You interviewed Madeline Brown.
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:57.324]  No, he said, I don't know anyone named Madeline Brown.
[01:55:57.364 --> 01:55:58.325]  You're mistaken.
[01:55:58.685 --> 01:56:00.608]  I never conducted any such interview.
[01:56:00.928 --> 01:56:03.331]  Folks, you can go to YouTube and find this interview.
[01:56:03.692 --> 01:56:08.897]   So why is Geraldo Rivera Covering up what he knew about the Kennedy assassination.
[01:56:09.177 --> 01:56:11.839]  This was groundbreaking journalism at the time he did it.
[01:56:12.159 --> 01:56:16.822]  Alex, I know that you yourself interviewed Madeleine Brown, so you know what I'm talking about.
[01:56:17.363 --> 01:56:26.429]  I believe that as a condition of getting his position at Fox, he had to renounce his role in uncovering the truth about John F. Kennedy's death.
[01:56:27.415 --> 01:56:29.036]  It's just incredible.
[01:56:29.136 --> 01:56:35.141]  And LBJ, before he died, told a lot of people that he was depressed about what he'd done, that he shouldn't have done it.
[01:56:35.241 --> 01:56:39.725]  And it was really, retrospectively, very, very upset about his life.
[01:56:40.125 --> 01:56:43.387]  And I've talked to members of his family, very close members of the family, that told me that.
[01:56:43.788 --> 01:56:44.248]  I'd read it.
[01:56:44.308 --> 01:56:45.009]  I asked them about it.
[01:56:45.029 --> 01:56:45.709]  They said it was true.
[01:56:46.150 --> 01:56:48.612]  Do you think he was just doing that for history?
[01:56:48.712 --> 01:56:51.654]  Or do you think he really looked back on what he'd done and was ashamed of it?
[01:56:52.907 --> 01:56:55.653]  Well, first of all, it's important to understand he was a functioning lunatic.
[01:56:55.693 --> 01:56:57.376]  I mean, he was a psychopath.
[01:56:57.717 --> 01:56:59.120]  He was an abuser of drugs.
[01:56:59.481 --> 01:57:00.182]  He was a pill popper.
[01:57:04.892 --> 01:57:19.207]  I mean, one of the reasons why he liked to conduct White House staff meetings while sitting on the toilet defecating was because it made the young Ivy League White House aides that he had inherited from JFK so incredibly uncomfortable.
[01:57:19.487 --> 01:57:21.669]  He wasn't just doing it to be crude.
[01:57:22.250 --> 01:57:24.953]  He was doing it to put them in their place.
[01:57:26.454 --> 01:57:32.096]  He was an epic womanizer and very, very open about that.
[01:57:32.616 --> 01:57:35.018]  He was a sadist without any question whatsoever.
[01:57:35.038 --> 01:57:46.823]  He was also a physical coward who falsified, you know, an act of bravery where he claimed that a military plane that he was riding on as a congressman was attacked during World War II.
[01:57:46.843 --> 01:57:48.304]  It was all a fabrication.
[01:57:48.644 --> 01:57:59.330]  So, if you go to my book, The Man Who Killed Kennedy, The Case Against LBJ, which, by the way, you can go to stonezone.com slash shop and get a copy of that great book.
[01:57:59.350 --> 01:58:01.611]  I just happen to have a copy of it right here.
[01:58:03.052 --> 01:58:09.455]  You can get the full story, none of which, of course, has been criticized as inauthentic.
[01:58:10.175 --> 01:58:15.814]   You're absolutely right about Alex, about the fact that the same forces who killed Kennedy,
[01:58:15.814 --> 01:58:23.854]   the same forces who removed Richard Nixon, they didn't assassinate him except for politically
[01:58:23.854 --> 01:58:25.854]  because he wanted peace.
[01:58:25.854 --> 01:58:27.494]  He was ending the war.
[01:58:27.494 --> 01:58:32.175]  He wanted a strategic arms limitation with the Soviets.
[01:58:32.175 --> 01:58:35.534]  He wanted to end the military draft.
[01:58:35.534 --> 01:58:38.494]  Particularly they opposed his opening the door to China.
[01:58:38.494 --> 01:58:42.735]   Those who say today all of our problems with China are because of Nixon, that's incorrect.
[01:58:42.735 --> 01:58:48.414]   Nixon used them skillfully, played them off against the Russians to get a strategic arms
[01:58:48.414 --> 01:58:52.934]   limitation which saved this country billions of dollars in defense spending.
[01:58:53.397 --> 01:59:03.782]  He had no way of knowing that the Bushes and the Clintons were later going to give the most favored... So let me ask you this, because we've got to get into what happened last week in Congress.
[01:59:03.802 --> 01:59:17.630]  We've got to get into the censorship ball coming out, the surveillance, the big textile of the election, it's so bombshell, and the documents that you and I were targeted along with others like Tucker Carlson, but in closing on the whole JFK thing, what would Richard Nixon, if he was alive today, think of the world?
[01:59:19.287 --> 01:59:25.389]  He would be shocked because Watergate, in retrospect, is literally small potatoes.
[01:59:25.449 --> 01:59:28.089]  It really was a second-rate burglary.
[01:59:28.450 --> 01:59:34.871]  Joe Biden and Barack Obama utilized the full legal authority of the U.S.
[01:59:34.931 --> 01:59:44.634]  government and the incredible capability of our intelligence agencies, utilizing what they knew was falsified evidence in the Steele dossier and the CrowdStrikes report.
[01:59:45.113 --> 01:59:50.412]   uh... to rationale rationalize in illegal who run by robert muller in an
[01:59:50.412 --> 01:59:54.813]   attempt to take out a sitting president of the united states sorry folks that's
[01:59:54.813 --> 02:00:00.413]   the biggest dirty trick in american political history and watergate pales in
[02:00:00.413 --> 02:00:04.853]   comparison watergate were a bunch of misguided private individuals
[02:00:04.853 --> 02:00:09.652]   but the watergate burglars had been had been infiltrated by the c_i_a_ we now
[02:00:09.652 --> 02:00:14.913]   know that four of the of the burglars were also on the grassy nolan dallas in
[02:00:14.913 --> 02:00:19.963]   nineteen sixty three we also know that four of the watergate burglars were still on
[02:00:19.963 --> 02:00:25.183]   the c_i_a_ payroll at the time of the break-in and the c_i_a_ had penetrated
[02:00:25.183 --> 02:00:29.783]   the burglar team and we're well aware of the break-in advance it was used to
[02:00:29.783 --> 02:00:34.033]   remove a richard nixon and to install a more pliable
[02:00:34.033 --> 02:00:40.953]   gerald r_ ford who in turn then made george h_w_ bush the head of the c_i_a_
[02:00:41.059 --> 02:00:42.459]  Stonezone.com.

[02:00:53.565 --> 02:00:55.426]  But definitely folks should be watching Infowars.
[02:00:55.446 --> 02:00:56.387]  A lot is coming up.

[02:01:11.656 --> 02:01:12.456]  This is big.
[02:01:12.496 --> 02:01:13.197]  This is important.

[02:01:34.763 --> 02:01:42.127]  We've talked about the past, now I want to talk about what happened last week, and in the present, and in the future with Congress, and everything that's coming and happening.

[02:03:40.898 --> 02:03:42.039]  All right, Roger Stone.
[02:03:42.739 --> 02:03:47.960]  We just spent 40 something minutes on the incredible history of JFK, what's coming out, it was amazing.
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:53.222]  Let's now go back to last week and your predictions coming true and what this means.
[02:03:53.242 --> 02:03:58.563]  A lot of folks are mad at Gates or MTG for going with McCarthy, but they're being loyal to Trump.
[02:03:58.823 --> 02:03:59.803]  Trump asked him to do it.
[02:04:00.063 --> 02:04:01.184]  We'll see if Trump's right.
[02:04:01.524 --> 02:04:02.524]  I don't trust McCarthy.
[02:04:02.584 --> 02:04:03.704]  We both try to get rid of him.
[02:04:03.984 --> 02:04:09.966]   But the silver lining you talked about six, eight months ago, Predicting that the Republicans wouldn't regain the Senate.
[02:04:10.426 --> 02:04:12.387]  Predicting they'd have a slim majority in the House.
[02:04:12.607 --> 02:04:19.470]  But if that small group of American firsters wield their power, they could have an incredibly positive agenda.
[02:04:19.691 --> 02:04:20.851]  So what happened last week?
[02:04:21.191 --> 02:04:21.731]  What's coming?
[02:04:21.771 --> 02:04:23.032]  And what should that agenda be?
[02:04:23.312 --> 02:04:25.113]  Roger Stone of StoneZone.com.
[02:04:26.674 --> 02:04:36.458]  Well, Alex, as you pointed out, I predicted right here on your show multiple times that the so-called coming red wave would turn out to be a pink drizzle.
[02:04:36.971 --> 02:04:41.831]   And the mainstream media and the Republican establishment attempt to blame
[02:04:41.831 --> 02:04:46.011]  that on Donald Trump was both overwhelming and obvious.
[02:04:46.011 --> 02:04:51.371]   Trump doesn't get credit for, for example, the election of J.D.
[02:04:51.371 --> 02:04:53.810]  Vance in Ohio in a difficult race.
[02:04:53.810 --> 02:04:58.631]   He doesn't get credit for the re-election of probably the number one Trump supporter
[02:04:58.631 --> 02:04:59.471]  in the U.S.
[02:04:59.471 --> 02:05:01.650]  Senate, Ron Johnson, in Wisconsin.
[02:05:01.650 --> 02:05:06.451]   In a year in which, by the way, we pretty much lost everything else in Wisconsin.
[02:05:06.690 --> 02:05:10.131]   Trump's win loss record, both in primaries and in the general
[02:05:10.131 --> 02:05:11.211]  elections are actually.
[02:05:11.538 --> 02:05:12.579]  Quite impressive.
[02:05:13.239 --> 02:05:15.600]  The problem with the Republican Party is with the mix.
[02:05:16.121 --> 02:05:20.343]  McConnell, McCarthy, and McDaniel.
[02:05:20.423 --> 02:05:22.224]  There is your problem.
[02:05:22.804 --> 02:05:37.052]  Ronald McDaniel, the Republican National Chairwoman, goes out and raises $95 million with the help of President Donald Trump, allegedly to spend the money on election integrity issues, doesn't spend a penny of it for that.
[02:05:37.532 --> 02:05:50.331]  A lot of shrimp cocktails, a lot of charter jets, a lot of five-star hotel resorts, and a lot of consultants on the tit doing God knows what, but what they're not doing is winning elections.
[02:05:50.471 --> 02:05:52.675]  Now, you're absolutely right, Alex.
[02:05:52.915 --> 02:06:07.664]  All along I have said that we would be better off with a very slim majority in which a group of hardcore freedom fighters could leverage their position to make demands on the Republican caucus.
[02:06:08.224 --> 02:06:10.245]  And that is, in the end, what happened.
[02:06:10.766 --> 02:06:26.513]   We are better off now that had we won by 35 seats, in which case Kevin McCarthy For those who say, oh how embarrassing for the Republican Party, we can't believe this is playing out in public, hogwash!
[02:06:26.953 --> 02:06:44.176]  I would rather see the American people see exactly what's happened rather than have us North Korea style making our decisions in some backroom smoke-filled room where special interest money is being used to purchase votes.
[02:06:44.696 --> 02:06:53.883]  This is how a democracy works in a democratic republic, and my hat is off to Matt Gaetz, who is a riverboat gambler.
[02:06:53.923 --> 02:06:56.385]  I mean, he has nerves of steel.
[02:06:57.026 --> 02:06:58.607]  There's ice water in his veins.
[02:06:59.268 --> 02:07:04.032]  Every possible threat was levied against him, and he never wavered.
[02:07:04.692 --> 02:07:09.136]  Also, credit to the others of the Freedom Caucus.
[02:07:13.300 --> 02:07:17.083]  Are the concessions they got from McCarthy worth it?
[02:07:17.583 --> 02:07:19.144]  I was not for Kevin McCarthy.
[02:07:19.304 --> 02:07:20.445]  I'll be very clear about it.
[02:07:21.145 --> 02:07:46.022]   The main reason I wasn't was because I saw him using party money, using National Republican Congressional Committee money and PAC money and special interest money to mow down true America first candidates like Joe Kent on the West Coast, like Jen They are Majewski in Ohio, like Laura Loomer in Florida, and insert his rhino lackeys in their place.
[02:07:46.042 --> 02:07:47.343]  Sure, well let's talk about this.
[02:07:47.583 --> 02:07:53.968]  I mean, look, if Trump asks MTG and Gates to go with McCarthy, and they do, we can't get mad at them if we're going to get mad at Trump.
[02:07:54.309 --> 02:08:04.157]  Why does Trump think McCarthy's going to be good, and what should the agenda be in the new Republican Congress now that this sliver of a majority run by American firsters have shown they're in the driver's seat?
[02:08:05.706 --> 02:08:10.267]  I must tell you, Alex, I'm perplexed by the president's trust in McCarthy.
[02:08:11.128 --> 02:08:14.328]  Yes, I expressed my own views to him privately.
[02:08:14.809 --> 02:08:17.950]  On the other hand, at this point, this is a done deal.
[02:08:18.330 --> 02:08:22.231]  He insists that McCarthy will turn out to be much better than we expected.
[02:08:22.611 --> 02:08:27.552]  But the good news is that there are 20 Republicans who will hold him to it.
[02:08:27.912 --> 02:08:35.436]   We're going to see today whether the radically improved House rules demanded by the rebels Are in fact adopted.
[02:08:35.856 --> 02:08:38.676]  And the agenda I think is very, very clear.
[02:08:38.676 --> 02:08:43.417]   First and foremost, articles of impeachment against Joe Biden.
[02:08:43.417 --> 02:08:46.896]   For those in the crazed lefty media who say there are no grounds,
[02:08:46.896 --> 02:08:49.577]  sorry, 10% for the big guy.
[02:08:49.844 --> 02:08:51.145]  There are the grounds right there.
[02:08:51.425 --> 02:08:54.186]  That is evidence of epic corruption.
[02:08:54.646 --> 02:09:06.833]  And Joe Biden, based on what we know from the non-disputed publications of the New York Post, was getting money from Russia, from Romania, from Ukraine, from China.
[02:09:07.133 --> 02:09:09.514]  That is treason, if not corruption.
[02:09:11.781 --> 02:09:17.564]  to impeach Joe Biden than there ever was to justify an impeachment of Donald Trump.
[02:09:18.144 --> 02:09:23.946]  We clearly need to investigate the activities of the FBI.
[02:09:24.286 --> 02:09:35.771]  We now know definitively that the FBI, you remember them, the guys who stormed my home at 6 o'clock in the morning with 29 armed FBI agents fully titted out.
[02:09:35.811 --> 02:09:39.273]  Well, that's my next question for the start of the next hour before Michael Cargill joins us.
[02:09:39.953 --> 02:09:43.915]  With his big victory at the Major Court of Appeals on the Second Amendment.
[02:09:45.795 --> 02:09:48.056]  We have a permanent in each state that's now out in the open.
[02:09:48.096 --> 02:09:52.418]  We have the admission of surveillance and censorship of not just you and I, but Tucker Carlson.
[02:09:52.938 --> 02:09:57.920]  How can McCarthy and Jim Jordan and others not have House hearings on this now?
[02:09:58.040 --> 02:09:59.740]  You should be testifying.
[02:10:00.101 --> 02:10:01.661]  Tucker Carlson should be testifying.
[02:10:01.681 --> 02:10:03.562]  I should be testifying ASAP.
[02:10:05.203 --> 02:10:09.125]  I agree, plus I frankly think we should not let January 6th rest.
[02:10:09.485 --> 02:10:12.006]  Nancy Pelosi's staff needs to be subpoenaed.
[02:10:12.346 --> 02:10:15.387]  Ray Epps needs to be subpoenaed to testify.
[02:10:15.407 --> 02:10:16.988]  Yeah, what do you make of Ray Epps under oath?
[02:10:17.088 --> 02:10:22.490]  They just released it saying that he orchestrated the whole thing.
[02:10:23.382 --> 02:10:31.805]  Yeah, but Alex, how could it be that he wasn't featured in those televised hearings where they smeared me and showed doctored videos of me saying stuff that I never said?
[02:10:32.125 --> 02:10:34.966]  But Ray Epps, he never gets called to testify.
[02:10:35.026 --> 02:10:38.128]  His testimony is never highlighted by the committee.
[02:10:38.348 --> 02:10:40.108]  This was the great Kabuki theater.
[02:10:40.528 --> 02:10:44.650]  The January 6th to me investigation is the biggest fraud against the American people.
[02:10:46.751 --> 02:10:48.411]  By the way, I should have gone with your instinct.
[02:10:48.971 --> 02:10:53.072]  A month before, you said, it's going to be a cluster F. I don't want to go, Marge.
[02:10:53.092 --> 02:10:54.273]  I don't want to be part of this.
[02:10:54.693 --> 02:10:56.533]  It'll get hijacked.
[02:10:56.573 --> 02:10:57.974]  And I said, come on, Roger, you got to come.
[02:10:58.014 --> 02:10:59.334]  And I bullied you into going.
[02:10:59.374 --> 02:10:59.834]  It's true.
[02:11:00.334 --> 02:11:01.334]  And then you were absolutely right.
[02:11:01.354 --> 02:11:02.475]  You had a gut feeling that morning.
[02:11:02.495 --> 02:11:03.955]  You said, I have no security.
[02:11:04.155 --> 02:11:04.995]  There's a million people.
[02:11:05.075 --> 02:11:06.396]  I barely even got to where I was going.
[02:11:06.716 --> 02:11:07.496]  You said, screw it.
[02:11:07.576 --> 02:11:08.116]  I'm leaving.
[02:11:08.236 --> 02:11:09.137]  Boy, you were right.
[02:11:09.417 --> 02:11:10.497]  What was your gut level feeling?
[02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:14.671]  You know, Alex, I've had six miracles in my life.
[02:11:14.711 --> 02:11:20.573]  The commutation of my sentence, the unconditional pardon, my wife's survival of stage four cancer.
[02:11:20.933 --> 02:11:27.195]  On the morning of January 6th, I stretched my legs outside the hotel and I said, no, this doesn't feel right.
[02:11:27.455 --> 02:11:28.816]  The Lord spoke to me that day.
[02:11:28.836 --> 02:11:29.516]  That's right.
[02:11:29.556 --> 02:11:30.816]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[02:11:30.836 --> 02:11:31.236]  Stay with us.
[02:11:32.697 --> 02:11:37.338]  Well, this is the best interview I've done with Roger Stone in eight years.
[02:11:38.519 --> 02:11:39.279]  Hands down, I know it.
[02:11:40.911 --> 02:11:41.351]  Amazing.
[02:11:41.491 --> 02:11:46.134]  I'm always twisting his arm to cover history and political topics, and not just how he's under attack.
[02:11:46.174 --> 02:11:50.757]  And I get he's got to defend himself, but man, now he's clear of almost all this garbage and attacks.
[02:11:50.797 --> 02:11:51.717]  He is on fire.
[02:11:52.057 --> 02:11:57.260]  And that's why they attack us, is to keep us from being able to really get in our stride and be offensive.
[02:11:57.300 --> 02:11:59.942]  We need an offensive Roger Shonen, offensive Alex Jones.
[02:12:00.342 --> 02:12:03.624]  That's what your support of Roger Stone and his show weekdays, 5 p.m.
[02:12:03.645 --> 02:12:05.526]  Central, StoneZone.live.
[02:12:05.886 --> 02:12:06.767]  I'll be on the show Wednesday.
[02:12:06.827 --> 02:12:07.447]  It's so important.
[02:12:07.888 --> 02:12:09.088]  Roger, this is a shorter segment.
[02:12:09.128 --> 02:12:12.451]  Some stations join us, but any other little Richard Nixon stories?
[02:12:12.471 --> 02:12:14.773]  You've told me so many privately, but amazing.
[02:12:15.273 --> 02:12:20.537]  But just any other little tidbits before we hit Elon Musk, the censorship, the Twitter files, and all that's coming out next segment.
[02:12:20.777 --> 02:12:22.018]  Ahead of Mr. Cargill joining us.
[02:12:23.328 --> 02:12:35.401]  Well, Alex, as you know, J. Edgar Hoover, who was the first, and for decades, the head of the incredibly politicized and corrupt FBI, served through multiple administrations.
[02:12:35.982 --> 02:12:42.469]  Nixon knew that at LBJ's orders, Hoover had actually wiretapped Nixon's campaign plan in 1968.
[02:12:44.958 --> 02:12:54.021]  Nixon intended to fire Hoover, and he summons the FBI director to the White House for a meeting in which he was supposed to give Hoover the axe.
[02:12:54.761 --> 02:13:08.605]  Hoover came into the meeting with a brown paper envelope, and from it, he removed photographs of Nixon in flagrante delicto, as they say, with a Chinese hostess in Hong Kong.
[02:13:09.065 --> 02:13:14.527]  And he said, don't worry, Mr. President, these pictures are safe with me.
[02:13:15.208 --> 02:13:36.120]  Hoover had actually gotten the photographs from the British Secret Service, the British intelligence agency, who had shot the photos through a hotel room window to get Nixon, who was then out of work, former vice president, but on whom they might in the future need blackmail leverage into Hoover's hands.
[02:13:36.501 --> 02:13:38.962]  So that story has never been revealed.
[02:13:39.042 --> 02:13:44.425]  That is over-the-top insane, and inside baseball, you knew it, but he had a taste for Asian women.
[02:13:44.785 --> 02:13:45.545]  We'll leave it at that.
[02:13:46.165 --> 02:13:49.687]  But you were big friends with him, hung out with him a lot after he was president, knew him.
[02:13:49.727 --> 02:13:52.949]  No, I was, let's be candid, they didn't call him Big Dick for no reason.
[02:13:54.469 --> 02:13:58.011]  Well, also, LBJ, he had a name for his, it was Jumbo, wasn't it?
[02:13:58.914 --> 02:14:01.855]  Yes, he was a notorious womanizer.
[02:14:02.715 --> 02:14:07.377]  And in college, you often would say, I think I'll take Jumbo out for some exercise.
[02:14:07.937 --> 02:14:10.699]  Look, to be president of the United States, you have to be a misfit.
[02:14:11.139 --> 02:14:16.301]  I mean, to be in the public eye like that, every one of our presidents has been flawed in some way.
[02:14:16.921 --> 02:14:22.143]  John F. Kennedy, as you know, had become addicted to crystal meth.
[02:14:22.382 --> 02:14:27.391]  was being treated by Dr. Max Jacobson, also known as Dr.
[02:14:27.391 --> 02:14:32.082]   Feelgood, who was injecting all the beautiful people of that period.
[02:14:32.082 --> 02:14:39.081]   Aristotle Onassis, Maria Kalei, the opera singer, Leonard Bernstein, the conductor, Nelson Rockefeller,
[02:14:39.081 --> 02:14:43.182]   the governor of New York, one of the richest men on the planet at that time.
[02:14:43.182 --> 02:14:47.682]  All of them, Joe DiMaggio, Marilyn Monroe.
[02:14:47.682 --> 02:14:53.882]   Incredible. So Nixon told you that J. Edgar Hoover, the head of the FBI,
[02:14:53.882 --> 02:14:59.382]   the famous cross-dresser himself, blackmailed by the mafia, came in and showed him photos of him getting a blowjob.
[02:15:00.291 --> 02:15:02.713]  Well, he didn't say, he didn't use those exact words.
[02:15:02.753 --> 02:15:07.417]  He just said, compromising photos of me and a Chinese woman.
[02:15:08.152 --> 02:15:19.438]  So, yes, Nixon was a red-blooded, normal human being, and people always thought that his awkwardness, his stiffness was arrogance.
[02:15:19.518 --> 02:15:21.279]  No, Alex, he was shy.
[02:15:21.339 --> 02:15:28.663]  He was an introvert in an extrovert's business, and today would have been his 110th birthday.
[02:15:28.763 --> 02:15:28.963]  Wow.
[02:15:29.023 --> 02:15:30.183]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[02:15:30.343 --> 02:15:30.624]  Wow.
[02:15:32.332 --> 02:15:33.373]  Final segment with Roger.
[02:15:33.533 --> 02:15:34.413]  Powerful interview.
[02:15:34.433 --> 02:15:38.936]  I'll be on with him Wednesday at StoneZoneLive.com on the great Frank Speech TV.
[02:15:39.856 --> 02:15:41.837]  I don't see Frank Speech or any of these groups as competition.
[02:15:41.877 --> 02:15:43.678]  I see them as brothers in the fight.
[02:15:43.818 --> 02:15:51.643]  Our job is to get more people speaking out, more people taking action, and more of you telling folks the fight goes on against the globalists, and we're actually winning.
[02:15:51.743 --> 02:15:53.844]  Barely, but we're actually winning right now.
[02:15:54.244 --> 02:16:02.510]  So spread the word about InfoWars.com, about NewsWars.com, about Man Up Video, and about Roger Stone's show that was always popular when he started six months ago but is exploding right now.
[02:16:03.090 --> 02:16:18.520]  Roger, in the nine minutes or six, seven minutes we have left before Mr. Cargill comes in here, the censorship, all of it coming out, the control, the criminality, the Attorney General's investigating it, the emails coming out with the White House literally ordering them to censor Tucker Carlson and others.
[02:16:19.081 --> 02:16:23.504]  If we don't have investigations in Congress, if we don't have criminal charges, I mean, this is done.
[02:16:23.524 --> 02:16:26.826]   They're just Everything we thought was happening is confirmed.
[02:16:26.966 --> 02:16:28.007]  Total vindication.
[02:16:28.047 --> 02:16:28.568]  Roger Stone.
[02:16:29.829 --> 02:16:50.183]   Alex, it's really quite extraordinary, but at the same time, the Brunson case, which I had high hopes for, which literally had the potential to overturn the 2020 election and also eliminate the legal eligibility for a number of those currently in Congress, was denied by the Supreme Court today.
[02:16:50.183 --> 02:16:53.923]  Why they even heard it now becomes a serious question mark.
[02:16:53.923 --> 02:16:56.823]  So our fate lies in the hands of two groups.
[02:16:56.823 --> 02:17:03.702]   One are the state attorney generals who are taking the fight right to the social media monoliths,
[02:17:03.702 --> 02:17:06.862]  the Silicon Valley giants.
[02:17:06.862 --> 02:17:09.222]  The other is the US Congress.
[02:17:09.222 --> 02:17:14.743]   And I feel better sleeping at night knowing that Matt Gaetz and a handful of rebels
[02:17:14.743 --> 02:17:18.903]  are on hand to hold Kevin McCarthy's feet to the fire.
[02:17:18.767 --> 02:17:20.848]  Look, I want to be wrong about Kevin McCarthy.
[02:17:21.128 --> 02:17:24.510]  I want President Trump to be right about Kevin McCarthy.
[02:17:24.850 --> 02:17:52.121]   If McCarthy will investigate Joe and Hunter Biden, if he will investigate this internet censorship, which is a violation of antitrust law, If he will investigate the abuses of the FBI, if he will look into the origins of the COVID-19 vaccination, which is, we now know definitively, neither safe nor effective, then we will have done our job and the nation will be preserved.
[02:17:52.701 --> 02:17:54.904]  I'm doing a lot of praying these days, Alex.
[02:17:54.924 --> 02:18:02.651]  You know, I'm a political strategist and usually I have a very tight, succinct, understandable strategy going forward.
[02:18:03.012 --> 02:18:07.697]  But now at this juncture, I must tell you, I'm of a mind to trust his plan.
[02:18:08.397 --> 02:18:11.038]  I don't believe that he will allow this nation to be destroyed.
[02:18:11.478 --> 02:18:16.859]  I don't believe the Lord will allow that great thing which he has created, America's freedom.
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:30.863]  America is a shining city on a hill as a beacon of freedom to be destroyed, but recognize the more they are exposed, the more hysterical and the more dangerous the deep state gets.
[02:18:31.644 --> 02:18:36.687]   Case in point, They tell us in the one hand, Donald Trump, he's damaged.
[02:18:37.048 --> 02:18:37.788]  He's finished.
[02:18:38.168 --> 02:18:38.829]  He's through.
[02:18:39.009 --> 02:18:40.050]  He's unpopular.
[02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:44.374]  He's responsible for the midterm underperformance.
[02:18:44.774 --> 02:18:55.563]  And then in the next breath, they say, but we've got to charge him with some crime that eliminates him from contention as a candidate in 2024, which exposes that they don't believe any of that.
[02:18:55.663 --> 02:18:58.825]   They know that he's No, and I totally agree, but let me add this.
[02:18:58.925 --> 02:19:03.046]  Trump, reportedly, is it true, you can tell us, threatened to run third party.
[02:19:03.646 --> 02:19:05.887]  Is that to threaten the Republicans, not to throw him under the bus?
[02:19:06.307 --> 02:19:08.347]  And even McCarthy thanked him for getting him in.
[02:19:08.387 --> 02:19:11.528]  So McCarthy recognizes Trump is still the head of the Republican Party.
[02:19:12.789 --> 02:19:20.531]  Look, the grassroots of the Republican Party still belong lock, stock and barrel to Donald Trump, and nobody can come close to touching him.
[02:19:21.158 --> 02:19:23.721]  That's not the same as party elites in Washington.
[02:19:23.741 --> 02:19:31.668]  In other words, Alex, the people who were never for Trump, not in 2016 or really in 2020, those are the people who are opposed to him.
[02:19:31.909 --> 02:19:34.311]  When you and I were for him, they were opposed to him.
[02:19:35.012 --> 02:19:37.214]  But no, there will be no third party effort.
[02:19:37.254 --> 02:19:38.355]  That is a misnomer.
[02:19:39.236 --> 02:19:41.438]  The effort just to get on the ballot.
[02:19:42.303 --> 02:19:56.028]  And then get into the presidential debates in a fixed system in which the presidential commission on debates is not controlled by the president, is not a commission, most definitely not a debate, is too much of an uphill climb.
[02:19:56.568 --> 02:20:01.950]  I would argue that at the grassroots level, we need to take back the Republican Party.
[02:20:02.309 --> 02:20:08.789]   Just as the 2016 nomination of Trump was a hostile takeover of the country club party,
[02:20:08.789 --> 02:20:14.350]   theretofore controlled by the Bushes, yet again we need another takeover of the party
[02:20:14.350 --> 02:20:15.350]  of Lincoln.
[02:20:15.350 --> 02:20:16.350]  And that's happening.
[02:20:16.350 --> 02:20:17.789]  So let's not say we're defeated when we're not.
[02:20:17.789 --> 02:20:20.789]   If these 20 or so people realize the power they have, we win.
[02:20:20.789 --> 02:20:24.868]   And we're about to see if McCarthy goes with the new house rules the way he said he would.
[02:20:24.868 --> 02:20:25.868]  This is breaking.
[02:20:25.868 --> 02:20:29.069]   House Freedom caucus member Representative Mark Green has won the race to be the chair
[02:20:29.069 --> 02:20:30.189]  of the Homeland Security Committee.
[02:20:30.534 --> 02:20:32.936]  Defeating Ipach, McCain, Dan Crenshaw.
[02:20:33.296 --> 02:20:39.179]  Also Representative Mike Rogers to Lunge Representative Matt Gaetz has announced he's stepping down from the House Steering Committee.
[02:20:39.439 --> 02:20:41.040]  So these are big, big wins, are they not?
[02:20:42.068 --> 02:20:42.728]  They are indeed.
[02:20:42.749 --> 02:20:55.897]  And I think Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert and a band of others deserve a credit, enormous credit for having the courage to press this fight under enormous pressure not to do so.
[02:20:56.358 --> 02:20:58.519]  I want President Trump to be right.
[02:20:58.959 --> 02:21:03.803]  I think Donald Trump in a second term would be very different than Donald Trump in a first term.
[02:21:04.083 --> 02:21:11.928]  I think he has a much clearer understanding now of the deep state and the fact from the second he came down the elevator, they were out to get him.
[02:21:13.129 --> 02:21:22.038]  I don't think you will see the same quislings inside a Trump administration the second time, and he is our last, best hope to save the country.
[02:21:22.979 --> 02:21:23.599]  I've talked to him.
[02:21:23.619 --> 02:21:25.681]  His mood is amazingly strong.
[02:21:25.701 --> 02:21:35.491]  I keep reading in New York Magazine, this is only read by beatniks and weirdos on the Upper West Side, that Trump is isolated, Trump is depressed.
[02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:38.430]  So it's all lies and InfoWars is strong as well.
[02:21:38.430 --> 02:21:41.709]   Our listeners will just support us, buy the products and spread the word.
[02:21:41.709 --> 02:21:43.110]  Roger, incredible job.
[02:21:43.110 --> 02:21:45.309]  You've got to host your show at 5pm today on Frank's Speech.
[02:21:45.309 --> 02:21:47.510]  I'll be with you there on Wednesday.
[02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:49.870]  So many big shows, big interviews coming up here as well.
[02:21:49.870 --> 02:21:52.790]  Roger Stone, thank you so much for all your time.
[02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:53.870]  God bless you my friend.
[02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:54.870]  What a survivor.
[02:21:54.870 --> 02:21:55.870]  What a winner.
[02:21:55.870 --> 02:21:56.870]  What a maverick.
[02:21:56.870 --> 02:22:02.589]   So Alex, today StoneZone.live at 5 o'clock we have Tyler Nixon and former Richard Nixon
[02:22:02.589 --> 02:22:04.670]  executive assistant Monica Crowley.
[02:22:04.685 --> 02:22:06.308]  Beautiful, thank you so much Roger.
[02:22:06.368 --> 02:22:07.310]  Mr. Cargill coming up.
[02:22:11.672 --> 02:22:16.994]  Do not save InfoWall.
[02:22:17.454 --> 02:22:22.995]  Do not be part of their year-end fundraiser at InfoWallStore.com with huge sales.
[02:22:23.395 --> 02:22:25.276]  Do not click on the donation button.
[02:22:25.836 --> 02:22:28.037]  Give up, roll over, and die.
[02:22:28.577 --> 02:22:30.717]  InfoWall is more influential than ever.
[02:22:31.137 --> 02:22:32.538]  It is important to shut them down.
[02:22:32.918 --> 02:22:35.198]  So I am ordering you now in the name of CCP.
[02:22:35.538 --> 02:22:37.399]  Do not go to InfoWallStore.com.
[02:22:38.632 --> 02:22:43.636]  Yes, Fentanyl, the lovable, chi-com, mass-murdering dragon is back.
[02:22:44.276 --> 02:22:55.865]  And what prompted me to bring back Fentanyl is that we know there are massive denial-of-service attacks aimed at InfoWars and InfoWarsStore.com right now, coming out of Communist China, who's allied with the WEF.
[02:22:56.285 --> 02:23:01.990]  So the worst people on Earth are actually trying to shut down InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:23:02.270 --> 02:23:03.650]  So sometimes the sites are slow.
[02:23:03.770 --> 02:23:04.610]  They're totally secure.
[02:23:04.990 --> 02:23:10.992]  But when you're able to get through to the site, InfoWarsTore.com, you're able to make orders on super high quality products.
[02:23:11.292 --> 02:23:17.773]  But sometimes our little friends, bosses, the CCP and GGP are going to be able to successfully slow the site down.
[02:23:18.113 --> 02:23:21.533]  Don't let them keep you from ordering products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:23:21.773 --> 02:23:22.834]  Take action now.
[02:23:23.234 --> 02:23:30.215]  Let fentanyl's masters know the American people and others will not bow to their tyranny and humanity is awakening and we're going to defeat the new world order together.
[02:23:33.149 --> 02:23:33.389]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:23:33.409 --> 02:23:34.570]  I don't even know what this is.
[02:23:34.630 --> 02:23:36.352]  How did you get here?
[02:23:36.472 --> 02:23:38.513]  I just caught you, American.
[02:23:38.854 --> 02:23:40.895]  You visited Bandar Video.
[02:23:41.836 --> 02:23:45.078]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[02:23:45.619 --> 02:23:51.904]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video or I have to hurt you.
[02:23:52.163 --> 02:23:59.163]   This is the best one for you, I ain't saying anything. It comes from China.
[02:23:59.163 --> 02:24:25.163]  Good news and some bad news on multiple fronts.
[02:24:25.199 --> 02:24:29.382]  The good news is, Vitamin and Mineral Fusion and DNA Force Plus are still 50% off.
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:33.642]  The bad news is they're very close to selling out.
[02:24:34.102 --> 02:24:40.627]  And by Monday of next week, and I'm cutting this ad on January 5th, 2023, we're going to have to go back to full price.
[02:24:40.647 --> 02:24:42.889]  And then about a week after that, they'll be sold out.
[02:24:43.549 --> 02:24:44.290]  So that's good news.
[02:24:44.310 --> 02:24:45.251]  You can still get the products.
[02:24:45.491 --> 02:24:50.935]  It's bad news because they're about to be sold out because they're also some of our best selling products.
[02:24:50.955 --> 02:24:53.097]  When we don't have them, we can't fund the operation.
[02:24:53.749 --> 02:24:56.711]  So it is a real conundrum, but that's just where we're at.
[02:24:56.731 --> 02:24:59.073]  I want to thank all the listeners for your ongoing support.
[02:24:59.553 --> 02:25:12.723]  But if you want Vitamineral Fusion, it's so incredible for your immune system, your whole body, and DNA Force Plus that helps your telomeres last longer and cleans out your mitochondria and so much more, you can get them both exclusively, top-of-the-line supplements, at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:25:12.803 --> 02:25:15.766]  Still 50% off until this coming Monday.
[02:25:15.786 --> 02:25:17.487]  They're going to be sold out for months and months.
[02:25:17.887 --> 02:25:18.888]  Thanks for all your support.
[02:25:19.188 --> 02:25:21.070]  Now please visit InfoWarStore.com.
[02:25:22.344 --> 02:25:31.371]  Well, the man we got in studio, I've taken firearms training from and got my concealed carry from many, many, many, many, many years ago.
[02:25:31.391 --> 02:25:32.772]  He's a good friend of mine.
[02:25:32.792 --> 02:25:36.575]  We hang out and go out and enjoy ourselves at dinner.
[02:25:36.615 --> 02:25:37.075]  You name it.
[02:25:37.115 --> 02:25:38.256]  He's Michael Cargill.
[02:25:38.296 --> 02:25:43.336]   I've been really pushing to try to get him on all of our other shows on a routine basis.
[02:25:43.336 --> 02:25:45.115]  But he fights hard.
[02:25:45.115 --> 02:25:48.015]  This guy right here, he has filed lawsuit after lawsuit.
[02:25:48.015 --> 02:25:50.895]  He's won most of them, which is really hard to do.
[02:25:50.895 --> 02:25:57.216]   And he just won the biggest Second Amendment victory of the last 20 years, 22 years in
[02:25:57.216 --> 02:25:58.216]  the new millennium.
[02:25:58.216 --> 02:25:59.216]  That's right.
[02:25:59.216 --> 02:26:01.995]  The bump stock ban was not a law.
[02:26:01.995 --> 02:26:03.416]  It was just done.
[02:26:03.416 --> 02:26:05.736]  And that affects all these other regulatory things.
[02:26:05.736 --> 02:26:10.375]   The ATF's doing trying to ban short rifles and all the rest of it that they just announced
[02:26:10.375 --> 02:26:11.375]  two weeks ago.
[02:26:11.375 --> 02:26:13.095]  Here's the headline from Reuters.
[02:26:13.095 --> 02:26:16.335]  U.S. appeals court strikes down ban on bump stocks.
[02:26:17.344 --> 02:26:17.944]  And who did it?
[02:26:18.324 --> 02:26:21.946]  Central Texas Gun Works, Michael Cargill.
[02:26:22.026 --> 02:26:24.247]  Talk about the epicenter of resistance.
[02:26:24.387 --> 02:26:25.968]  Austin isn't just the new L.A.
[02:26:26.408 --> 02:26:30.130]  It's a bunch of Texans here fighting for the future, and the battle is here.
[02:26:30.650 --> 02:26:32.731]  Michael D. Cargill served 12 years in the U.S.
[02:26:32.831 --> 02:26:35.512]  Army and studied criminal justice at Troy State University.
[02:26:35.812 --> 02:26:43.216]  While in the Army, Michael was awarded four Army Accommodation Medals, eight Army Achievement Medals, and four Army Good Conduct Medals.
[02:26:43.256 --> 02:26:44.917]  He is qualified as an expert marksman.
[02:26:45.757 --> 02:26:49.539]  Both rifle and grenade, and is airborne qualified as a parachutist.
[02:26:49.860 --> 02:26:56.784]  While in the Army, he instructed new recruits in drill and ceremony, as well as teaching them their secondary mission of guarding the U.S.
[02:26:57.184 --> 02:26:57.865]  Army General.
[02:26:58.305 --> 02:27:01.887]  After his honorable discharge, Michael worked for a telecommunications company in Austin, Texas.
[02:27:02.448 --> 02:27:17.256]   After working in Austin, he recruited as an area manager for different telecommunications companies based in Dallas, where he was entrusted with having the company accounts in Texas managing a budget of 2,500,000 and enough equipment for 60 central offices.
[02:27:17.276 --> 02:27:24.099]  2006, Michael founded, is really important work, a freight carrying company and became owner of CEO shortly thereafter.
[02:27:24.719 --> 02:27:29.381]  Michael obtained his concealed carry license at age 23.
[02:27:29.461 --> 02:27:33.283]  He was stationed at Fort Benning and is still a CHL ever since.
[02:27:33.823 --> 02:27:40.205]  Then decided to become a CHL instructor after his grandmother was attacked while waiting at a bus stop on a college campus.
[02:27:40.545 --> 02:27:45.606]  Michael has been a Texas DPS certified CHL instructor for many, many years.
[02:27:45.866 --> 02:27:50.447]  He's an NRA certified range instructor, NRA certified range safety officer.
[02:27:50.506 --> 02:27:55.447]   Michael has taught 1,000, this is old numbers, 426 to about 10,000 now.
[02:27:55.447 --> 02:28:00.047]   But the most important thing is he's the owner of Central Texas Gunworks, a company in South Austin
[02:28:00.047 --> 02:28:03.566]   specializing in firearm sales, gunsmithing, and personal protection and more.
[02:28:03.566 --> 02:28:05.166]  Central Texas Gunworks.
[02:28:05.166 --> 02:28:10.565]   But the big thing is he's been fighting the Globals at every front and got the biggest pro-Second Amendment
[02:28:10.565 --> 02:28:13.086]  ruling of the new millennium.
[02:28:13.086 --> 02:28:15.447]  Michael, I'm gonna try to shut up, give me the floor.
[02:28:15.447 --> 02:28:16.845]  Great job, brother.
[02:28:16.845 --> 02:28:19.926]   Yeah, this is, you know, Alex, I appreciate you having me come on.
[02:28:19.417 --> 02:28:20.938]  This is a really big case.
[02:28:20.958 --> 02:28:21.678]  This is a big deal.
[02:28:22.018 --> 02:28:30.203]  We're talking about taking it to the Department of Justice, taking it to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, because they're coming after AR pistols.
[02:28:30.703 --> 02:28:32.284]  They're coming after SIG braces.
[02:28:32.324 --> 02:28:33.405]  They're trying to get triggers.
[02:28:33.425 --> 02:28:34.486]  They're trying to get everything.
[02:28:34.526 --> 02:28:41.450]  And what I'm saying is you've got to stop, because the ATF, a federal agency within our federal government, cannot write law.
[02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:42.591]  They cannot create law.
[02:28:43.371 --> 02:28:44.811]  Congress has the right of bills.
[02:28:45.372 --> 02:28:49.192]  That bill has to be signed, you know, agreed on by both houses of Congress.
[02:28:49.633 --> 02:28:50.733]  It has to go to the President.
[02:28:50.753 --> 02:28:51.613]  The President signs it.
[02:28:51.673 --> 02:28:52.873]  That's how a bill becomes law.
[02:28:53.293 --> 02:28:57.534]  Not the ATF, an agency within our federal government, saying... They're not Congress.
[02:28:57.634 --> 02:28:58.014]  That's right.
[02:28:58.075 --> 02:29:06.517]  Something that I own, something that I have inside my house, I purchased legally, something that has, you know, was legal for 10 years, and two U.S.
[02:29:06.596 --> 02:29:10.316]   presidents all of a sudden they change their mind and they're saying hey it's
[02:29:10.316 --> 02:29:13.476]  illegal we're gonna confiscate. They make you criminal.
[02:29:13.476 --> 02:29:18.195]   Attorney you're a criminal felon overnight. Continue. A felon overnight and so I'm
[02:29:18.195 --> 02:29:22.726]   just like no this this can't stand so I decided to bring this case it's just
[02:29:22.726 --> 02:29:26.197]   me no one else Michael Cargill against the Department of Justice the
[02:29:26.197 --> 02:29:29.256]   Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and I'm telling you right now. Which would
[02:29:29.256 --> 02:29:34.346]   make you a major target you got courage. I will not be Hillary Clinton I'm telling
[02:29:34.346 --> 02:29:35.836]  you now.
[02:29:34.681 --> 02:29:43.285]  If something happens, something happens to me mysteriously, I love myself, I love my family, I have too many people who love me, anything happens to me, definitely, you know, question it.
[02:29:43.745 --> 02:29:50.668]  But we decided to bring this case against the federal government because we needed all that stuff to stop.
[02:29:51.108 --> 02:29:52.168]  You know, it's got to stop, Alex.
[02:29:52.789 --> 02:29:54.089]  I just love being around such a winner.
[02:29:54.329 --> 02:29:56.090]  I mean, you just nailed it, brother.
[02:29:57.891 --> 02:29:59.491]  How good did it feel when you heard about the ruling?
[02:30:02.103 --> 02:30:06.988]  I was actually in a restaurant and I ran out of the restaurant and they thought the gun store was, you know, being robbed or something.
[02:30:07.028 --> 02:30:14.716]  I ran out yelling and screaming, got on the phone talking to my attorney, running back to the shop to talk to my employees and we were just excited and ecstatic.
[02:30:15.296 --> 02:30:17.679]  The fact that we actually stuck it to the man.
[02:30:17.779 --> 02:30:19.220]  I'm excited to be around such a winner.
[02:30:19.440 --> 02:30:24.245]  This is just the beginning because this case, what this means is, we won... By the way, it would take hours.
[02:30:25.266 --> 02:30:26.666]  You just keep having victories.
[02:30:26.706 --> 02:30:27.967]  What do you got going on over here?
[02:30:28.027 --> 02:30:28.767]  You got like victory.
[02:30:29.027 --> 02:30:34.868]  Yeah, so we have the case that, this case here, we have another case that actually goes against the ATF.
[02:30:36.088 --> 02:30:39.649]  They're actually going after FFL dealers, Federal Farms Licensed Dealers.
[02:30:39.689 --> 02:30:47.070]  They're trying to shut down gun stores just by making simple errors and mistakes in the 4473, the transaction record.
[02:30:47.490 --> 02:30:52.351]  And so we're suing them for that and trying to protect all FFL dealers in this country.
[02:30:52.651 --> 02:30:55.733]  I was about to say, why don't we make you the NRA director, because they can't get anything done.
[02:30:56.513 --> 02:31:00.155]  It would be nice, because someone needs to stand up for the small guy.
[02:31:00.475 --> 02:31:02.656]  Stand up for the small mom and pop.
[02:31:02.676 --> 02:31:03.597]  And go on offense.
[02:31:03.737 --> 02:31:04.998]  Yes, and go on the offense.
[02:31:05.018 --> 02:31:07.079]  And I'm interrupting, but get back to what you're doing.
[02:31:07.259 --> 02:31:08.420]  And not go on the defense.
[02:31:08.460 --> 02:31:10.261]  We're tired of being on defense all the time.
[02:31:10.281 --> 02:31:13.402]  We need to put them on the defense and stop them immediately.
[02:31:13.963 --> 02:31:15.443]  So we have that lawsuit also.
[02:31:15.463 --> 02:31:29.794]   We have another one that we're launching, where if you walk into a gun store, you fill out the background check form, and if you are If you're delayed or denied, then you're reported to the FBI and you're put in a system where every law enforcement agency in the country has access to that.
[02:31:30.395 --> 02:31:35.800]  Now, there's a bill that some people agreed on that says if you're denied, then you're reported.
[02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:37.922]  But delays is not in the bill.
[02:31:38.082 --> 02:31:42.987]  And I'm saying you cannot add to what Congress did not write in that bill.
[02:31:43.507 --> 02:31:45.949]  So they're trying to say delayed, you're under investigation.
[02:31:45.970 --> 02:31:47.471]  That's total discrimination.
[02:31:47.671 --> 02:31:47.991]  Totally.
[02:31:48.131 --> 02:31:50.012]  And so we're saying, nope, you cannot do that.
[02:31:50.352 --> 02:31:52.813]  Because they're giving you a designation as maybe a bad person.
[02:31:53.353 --> 02:31:54.153]  You've never done anything wrong.
[02:31:54.273 --> 02:31:54.633]  That's right.
[02:31:55.273 --> 02:31:55.774]  That's right.
[02:31:55.794 --> 02:32:00.315]  Well, I bought a gun like six months ago and they said, are you related to Jennifer Jones or this?
[02:32:00.715 --> 02:32:04.316]  And I said, no, they were trying to connect me to other people in some database.
[02:32:04.376 --> 02:32:05.277]  I didn't even know who they were.
[02:32:05.497 --> 02:32:05.677]  Right.
[02:32:06.177 --> 02:32:08.618]  Now, and so what... It's really bad if you have a common name.
[02:32:08.798 --> 02:32:08.938]  Right.
[02:32:08.958 --> 02:32:11.819]  What you should do is you need to make sure you use your LTC.
[02:32:11.839 --> 02:32:13.019]  Use your LTC.
[02:32:13.399 --> 02:32:15.240]  That way you're not getting pinged in the system.
[02:32:15.540 --> 02:32:15.660]  OK?
[02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:17.781]  And that's why concealed carry is good.
[02:32:17.801 --> 02:32:21.024]  People ask me, well if Texas passed a law, no concealed carry, why do I need it?
[02:32:21.264 --> 02:32:22.605]  Because then it's all vetted, they know.
[02:32:22.845 --> 02:32:23.025]  Right.
[02:32:23.306 --> 02:32:28.750]  So if you walk to the gun store, you have your concealed handgun license, your LTC, you're not getting pinged in the federal system.
[02:32:29.010 --> 02:32:34.234]  You fill out the form, your LTC, your background check's been done, we're not contacting the federal authorities about you at all.
[02:32:34.575 --> 02:32:37.297]  So it's best to have a license so that we don't know what you're picking up.
[02:32:37.957 --> 02:32:39.078]  And then I'll tell you a little secret.
[02:32:39.518 --> 02:32:56.085]  If you walk into a gun store that in a state that borders another country like Texas borders Mexico, if you purchase two handguns in a five-day period or two rifles or shotguns in a five-day period, that gun store has got to report you to the FBI and to the chief law enforcement officer in the county that you live in.
[02:32:56.985 --> 02:32:58.065]  So keep that in mind as well.
[02:32:58.686 --> 02:32:59.326]  Keep going brother.
[02:33:01.328 --> 02:33:01.908]  That's a lot of stuff.
[02:33:02.208 --> 02:33:03.449]  No, man, you're the master at this.
[02:33:03.629 --> 02:33:09.271]  Yeah, so we're, you gotta know all these little tricks, you know, tricks and trades of what they're trying to do.
[02:33:09.651 --> 02:33:11.572]  And so that's why we're bringing this suit.
[02:33:11.832 --> 02:33:14.673]  But we do need a little help because I'm doing this all on my own.
[02:33:14.753 --> 02:33:15.273]  Oh, exactly.
[02:33:15.473 --> 02:33:15.813]  Exactly.
[02:33:16.073 --> 02:33:18.374]  People just expect, I was about to say, how the hell are you?
[02:33:18.694 --> 02:33:19.714]  I can't pay for lawsuits.
[02:33:19.734 --> 02:33:20.295]  How are you doing it?
[02:33:20.475 --> 02:33:20.795]  Right.
[02:33:20.875 --> 02:33:22.175]  It's just, we're doing it all ourselves.
[02:33:22.235 --> 02:33:22.935]  It's Michael Cargill.
[02:33:22.955 --> 02:33:31.538]   We're getting help from different organizations like some other, you know, Luckily, there's some attorneys that are helping us out, but we have so many different cases.
[02:33:31.558 --> 02:33:33.498]  The point is, you've got a history of victory.
[02:33:33.518 --> 02:33:34.539]  We need to back you.
[02:33:34.919 --> 02:33:36.479]  Right, and so we're needing help.
[02:33:37.279 --> 02:33:41.340]  I'm asking for people to help us a little bit so we can continue this fight.
[02:33:41.380 --> 02:33:43.120]  Now maybe help a little for your whole future.
[02:33:43.181 --> 02:33:51.862]  We have the momentum right now, and we have to push this case and other cases to the Supreme Court, because this Supreme Court is the court that's going to make it happen.
[02:33:52.163 --> 02:33:53.783]  Let's talk about that.
[02:33:54.583 --> 02:33:59.790]  I know, we've delivered here at Infowars, and listeners are backing us, but listen, back us all the way folks, we're delivering!
[02:34:00.070 --> 02:34:01.091]  These dogs hunt!
[02:34:01.472 --> 02:34:03.654]  That's Michael Cargill, Alex Jones, we hunt!
[02:34:03.935 --> 02:34:04.515]  We'll be right back.
[02:34:05.176 --> 02:34:06.097]  You want victory?
[02:34:06.618 --> 02:34:07.880]  You're tuning into the right channel.
[02:34:10.689 --> 02:34:18.554]  And my old friend, Michael Cargill, with the most consequential Second Amendment, pro-Segment ruling of the 21st century.
[02:34:18.574 --> 02:34:21.576]  In the last 22 years, he is here.
[02:34:22.076 --> 02:34:24.738]  Brother, I got a lot to say, but I'm going to just shut up and give you the floor.
[02:34:25.158 --> 02:34:26.339]  You got so much to talk about.
[02:34:26.359 --> 02:34:27.579]  This is huge.
[02:34:27.940 --> 02:34:28.940]  I love how you're forward thinking.
[02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:30.221]  You don't want to talk about your last victory.
[02:34:30.481 --> 02:34:31.862]  You're moved on to your other lawsuits.
[02:34:32.202 --> 02:34:33.283]  But I was asked to hear the break.
[02:34:33.783 --> 02:34:34.684]  Where's the NRA?
[02:34:34.724 --> 02:34:35.965]  They didn't file any of these things.
[02:34:36.245 --> 02:34:38.587]  They're taking credit for what you did, raising hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:34:38.847 --> 02:34:39.988]  I'm not a fan of the NRA.
[02:34:40.229 --> 02:34:42.431]  But if Michael Cargill, he's had a bunch of other victories.
[02:34:42.791 --> 02:34:43.632]  He's had all these victories.
[02:34:43.892 --> 02:34:45.013]  Why don't we make you?
[02:34:45.633 --> 02:34:46.454]  Ted Nugent's on the board.
[02:34:46.494 --> 02:34:46.955]  I love Ted.
[02:34:46.995 --> 02:34:47.575]  He's a great guy.
[02:34:47.975 --> 02:34:50.878]  We should get rid of Wayne LaPierre and put you in there.
[02:34:51.178 --> 02:35:01.043]  It would be nice, because what's happening is a lot of people are standing up and saying they did a lot, you know, but this case, if you look at the case, it just says Michael Cargill versus everyone else.
[02:35:01.083 --> 02:35:02.244]  There's no one else standing there.
[02:35:02.924 --> 02:35:05.746]  So, you know, we're going to continue on this fight.
[02:35:05.886 --> 02:35:07.226]  And this is not just for me.
[02:35:07.607 --> 02:35:10.048]  This is about the entire country.
[02:35:10.388 --> 02:35:15.631]  This is about, you know, every state, all 50 states, not just Texas.
[02:35:16.011 --> 02:35:19.553]  But unfortunately, this case, we beat it in the Fifth Circuit.
[02:35:19.873 --> 02:35:23.534]  So now what we need to happen is we need this case to go to Supreme Court.
[02:35:24.034 --> 02:35:41.998]  So what's going on is if we won the Fifth Circuit, so that means that Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, if for some reason the government does not appeal or ask for a stay, if they don't appeal to the Supreme Court, then that means that Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi will get their bump stocks back.
[02:35:42.518 --> 02:35:54.163]   But if they If the appeal is actually accepted in the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court takes up this case, they hear this case, they throw it back down, we get our bump stocks in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi.
[02:35:54.684 --> 02:36:00.067]  But if they take the case, hear the case, rule on the case, that would be the land of the law for all 50 states.
[02:36:01.156 --> 02:36:02.156]  And that's what we need to happen.
[02:36:02.156 --> 02:36:03.156]  We need this.
[02:36:03.156 --> 02:36:04.956]  So you need some backing right now by the R.A.
[02:36:04.956 --> 02:36:05.956]  Right now.
[02:36:05.956 --> 02:36:06.956]  We I need everyone's help.
[02:36:06.956 --> 02:36:08.716]  We need this case to go to Supreme Court.
[02:36:08.716 --> 02:36:11.476]  Why you want us to back a winner?
[02:36:11.476 --> 02:36:12.476]  That's right.
[02:36:12.476 --> 02:36:17.116]   We because the Supreme Court this court right now that we have is the court for us.
[02:36:17.116 --> 02:36:19.636]   This is the court that's going to help us with all our Second Amendment issues and we
[02:36:19.636 --> 02:36:23.036]   can get everything wrapped up right now within the next two years.
[02:36:23.036 --> 02:36:25.236]  And I think we can make a use playing this early on.
[02:36:25.236 --> 02:36:29.515]   But explain this doing things outside of law since they got away with this so far.
[02:36:29.515 --> 02:36:30.515]  You stopped them.
[02:36:30.515 --> 02:36:31.515]  They're doing it everywhere.
[02:36:31.515 --> 02:36:35.875]  This is the big fight is extrajudicial rules by them.
[02:36:35.875 --> 02:36:36.875]  Right.
[02:36:36.875 --> 02:36:37.875]  And it goes everywhere.
[02:36:37.875 --> 02:36:40.116]  There's a whole Republican things about blocking laws.
[02:36:40.116 --> 02:36:43.396]  The ATF just does stuff without law.
[02:36:43.439 --> 02:36:46.220]  Without being checked, you know, they'll do whatever they want to do.
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:47.120]  And that's what they're doing.
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:50.241]  They're going, you know, let's try to, you know, squeeze this in.
[02:36:50.281 --> 02:36:50.882]  Let's do this.
[02:36:50.982 --> 02:36:53.422]  You know, let's take an inch and then grab a mile or whatever.
[02:36:53.762 --> 02:36:55.403]  And we're saying, no, you got to stop.
[02:36:55.543 --> 02:36:57.464]  You know, and we need to stand up and stand together.
[02:36:57.504 --> 02:36:58.864]  They need to support you, Alex.
[02:36:59.484 --> 02:37:01.765]  Support us so we can move forward and get these cases.
[02:37:01.785 --> 02:37:02.245]  Damn right.
[02:37:02.545 --> 02:37:03.926]  So how do we support you?
[02:37:04.506 --> 02:37:07.068]  Uh, we have a GoFundMe page that we started up, uh, today.
[02:37:07.088 --> 02:37:12.171]  Uh, we're asking people to go to that, go to that site, you know, donate to that site so we can get these cases.
[02:37:12.211 --> 02:37:21.197]  We have so many cases and this is the time we've got to get this court, this Supreme Court to hear these cases so we can get some victories, some major victories across the United States.
[02:37:21.217 --> 02:37:21.558]  And by the way...
[02:37:22.298 --> 02:37:25.280]  You're not just successful because you're smart and caring and involved.
[02:37:25.901 --> 02:37:28.663]  You are positive and you don't quit.
[02:37:28.703 --> 02:37:29.623]  You enjoy what you're doing.
[02:37:29.843 --> 02:37:30.364]  I love it.
[02:37:30.544 --> 02:37:31.024]  I love it.
[02:37:31.365 --> 02:37:33.506]  I have people that travel around the country.
[02:37:33.526 --> 02:37:34.987]  People ask, how do you do this Alex?
[02:37:35.067 --> 02:37:35.848]  And I love it.
[02:37:36.228 --> 02:37:36.448]  Yes.
[02:37:36.748 --> 02:37:37.169]  I love it.
[02:37:37.489 --> 02:37:38.670]  I love it.
[02:37:38.710 --> 02:37:39.832]  There's nothing like Texas.
[02:37:40.132 --> 02:37:41.413]  There's nothing like the United States.
[02:37:41.433 --> 02:37:43.055]  There's no other country that's better than this country.
[02:37:43.075 --> 02:37:50.523]  We want to make it better and continue to keep it strong and make sure that everyone in the world knows that if they come to the United States, we are here to defend them.
[02:37:50.543 --> 02:37:51.905]  So give us that fundraiser right now.
[02:37:51.925 --> 02:37:53.907]  If folks don't bet on a winner, they deserve to be slaves.
[02:37:54.107 --> 02:37:54.467]  That's right.
[02:37:54.968 --> 02:37:57.471]  Go to our GoFundMe page.
[02:37:57.531 --> 02:37:58.892]  It should be on the screen right now.
[02:37:58.972 --> 02:37:59.513]  Check that out.
[02:38:00.093 --> 02:38:01.135]  Please help us out.
[02:38:01.235 --> 02:38:01.535]  Donate.
[02:38:01.575 --> 02:38:04.478]  We just started that page just today, just a few hours ago.
[02:38:05.119 --> 02:38:05.840]  So let's go there.
[02:38:06.060 --> 02:38:06.661]  Let's donate.
[02:38:07.281 --> 02:38:08.883]  We need to get this momentum going.
[02:38:08.943 --> 02:38:09.504]  Keep it going.
[02:38:09.584 --> 02:38:13.208]  I don't want to stop right now because we're on the cusp of getting everything that we need.
[02:38:13.228 --> 02:38:15.070]  I don't know about a winner that's proven.
[02:38:15.130 --> 02:38:16.111]  I'm going to roll over.
[02:38:18.399 --> 02:38:21.180]  But continuing with what this rulemaking means outside of law.
[02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:21.860]  Right.
[02:38:22.401 --> 02:38:27.642]  So what this means is we stopped the ATF from going after AR triggers.
[02:38:27.723 --> 02:38:31.004]  We stopped them from going after SIG braces and other braces.
[02:38:31.844 --> 02:38:33.945]  You have companies like RW Arms.
[02:38:34.465 --> 02:38:39.007]  They actually had to destroy, Alex, $20 million worth of bump stocks.
[02:38:39.527 --> 02:38:39.807]  $20 million.
[02:38:40.567 --> 02:38:47.150]  Well, they called me up this week and they said, Mike, your lawsuit helps our case because of my lawsuit.
[02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:50.131]  They're going to get their $20 million back.
[02:38:50.891 --> 02:38:53.092]  Well, they better carve off some to support you.
[02:38:53.812 --> 02:38:54.052]  Right.
[02:38:54.353 --> 02:38:55.853]  So it's going to help them.
[02:38:56.113 --> 02:38:57.834]  It's going to help Rare Breed Triggers.
[02:38:58.234 --> 02:39:01.095]  Another company is being attacked by the ATF.
[02:39:01.375 --> 02:39:02.276]  They're going after them.
[02:39:03.056 --> 02:39:05.517]  I got a call from the guy at Rare Breed Triggers.
[02:39:05.557 --> 02:39:08.158]  He said, Mike, your case is going to help us.
[02:39:08.638 --> 02:39:10.699]  And I said, yes, so let's keep this going.
[02:39:11.419 --> 02:39:12.980]  Why didn't you do what you're doing?
[02:39:16.417 --> 02:39:17.598]  You're standing up for everybody right now.
[02:39:17.618 --> 02:39:18.178]  Yes, everyone.
[02:39:18.218 --> 02:39:19.639]  This is not just for me, it's for everybody.
[02:39:20.300 --> 02:39:21.020]  And we're doing good.
[02:39:21.341 --> 02:39:22.702]  We'll continue.
[02:39:23.162 --> 02:39:27.786]  I'm loving the positive attitude, but like I said, we are going to need the support as well.
[02:39:27.866 --> 02:39:29.347]  So we need to continue to move forward.
[02:39:30.248 --> 02:39:31.028]  There's a lot of stuff.
[02:39:31.068 --> 02:39:32.269]  There's so many different things.
[02:39:32.509 --> 02:39:38.352]   The ATF, They're shutting down gun stores and federal firearms licensed dealers around the country.
[02:39:38.872 --> 02:39:57.598]  You have small mom-and-pop gun stores that started their business with their life savings, and just because someone walked into the store, filled out the form, and there's a spot on the form where you're supposed to put county, instead of putting the county, they put United States, the U.S.
[02:39:58.198 --> 02:40:03.263]  And because of that little mistake on the form, they're shutting down these mom-and-pop gun stores.
[02:40:03.703 --> 02:40:09.428]  I have gun dealers all around the country calling me and saying, Mike, you know, is there a way you can help us?
[02:40:09.468 --> 02:40:10.789]  So they're using technicalities?
[02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:12.991]  Yes, just small little things like that.
[02:40:13.311 --> 02:40:14.672]  And they're wanting me to help them out.
[02:40:14.732 --> 02:40:17.154]  It's like, man, I'm just a dealer just like you.
[02:40:17.595 --> 02:40:20.257]  You know, but this lawsuit that we filed is going to help you out.
[02:40:20.537 --> 02:40:23.019]  And so that's why we need... But that's the difference is you're on offense.
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:23.540]  That's right.
[02:40:23.900 --> 02:40:25.221]  I don't want to be in that position.
[02:40:25.241 --> 02:40:27.682]  I don't want to be in a position where I have them looking out for me.
[02:40:27.702 --> 02:40:28.562]  Yeah, but you are different.
[02:40:28.822 --> 02:40:31.003]  It would take hours to go over, but you're always on offense.
[02:40:31.223 --> 02:40:32.063]  Right.
[02:40:32.083 --> 02:40:33.384]  What made you go on offense?
[02:40:34.044 --> 02:40:36.045]  Just looking at how everyone else is being treated.
[02:40:36.065 --> 02:40:37.745]  And I said, I don't want to be put in that predicament.
[02:40:37.826 --> 02:40:41.827]  I don't want to be in a spot where... So you see others being put down.
[02:40:42.307 --> 02:40:44.268]  You have empathy, which means it affects you.
[02:40:44.288 --> 02:40:44.788]  You're smart.
[02:40:45.168 --> 02:40:45.909]  You stand up.
[02:40:46.009 --> 02:40:46.169]  Yes.
[02:40:46.943 --> 02:40:47.303]  That's right.
[02:40:47.563 --> 02:40:49.144]  And stand up and stop it and say, you know what?
[02:40:49.504 --> 02:40:50.745]  Let's go on the offense here.
[02:40:51.385 --> 02:40:54.847]  Let's stop them where they're doing right now so they don't come after us.
[02:40:54.907 --> 02:40:55.347]  Well, that's it.
[02:40:55.387 --> 02:40:57.488]  The gun community is the most powerful community in America.
[02:40:57.889 --> 02:41:00.010]  Why don't we do what Michael Cardinal is doing?
[02:41:00.050 --> 02:41:00.730]  It's so frustrating.
[02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:02.711]  Why don't you flex your muscles, folks?
[02:41:02.811 --> 02:41:03.171]  That's right.
[02:41:03.371 --> 02:41:03.732]  That's right.
[02:41:04.232 --> 02:41:07.834]  You have to because if you don't, I'm telling you right now, I don't want to be a sheep.
[02:41:07.914 --> 02:41:12.156]  I don't want to be, you know, guided to, you know, do it one direction or whatever.
[02:41:13.056 --> 02:41:14.437]  So we got to stand strong.
[02:41:15.137 --> 02:41:16.118]  What else is on your radar?
[02:41:16.812 --> 02:41:23.916]  So we're also working on the, there's one where you walk into the gun store and you fill out the form and the delay denies.
[02:41:24.316 --> 02:41:44.887]  That, listen, there's a bill that Congress passed, I disagree with this bill, I hate it, but it says that if you walk into the gun store, you fill out the 4473, the firearms transaction record, and that transaction is denied, then you're going to be reported and investigated by the FBI and also put in a system where every law enforcement agency in the country has access to it.
[02:41:45.487 --> 02:41:46.027]  Okay, fine.
[02:41:46.107 --> 02:41:47.928]  The bill passed, so there's nothing I can do with that.
[02:41:48.528 --> 02:41:51.069]  But the ATF is taking it a step further.
[02:41:51.449 --> 02:41:55.150]  They're saying, hey, we're going to extend that to delays.
[02:41:55.810 --> 02:41:59.391]  If you walk into the gun store and you're in transactions delay, a lot of people get delayed.
[02:41:59.851 --> 02:42:05.913]  If your name is similar to someone else's, your John Smith, your Carlos Rodriguez, very common name, you're going to get delayed.
[02:42:06.393 --> 02:42:09.434]  And so if you get delayed, you have a charge pending.
[02:42:09.914 --> 02:42:13.855]  That agency that has that charge, they haven't responded.
[02:42:14.375 --> 02:42:16.618]  If that happens, your transaction will be delayed.
[02:42:16.658 --> 02:42:19.401]  If you're delayed, just a simple charge will delay you.
[02:42:20.222 --> 02:42:25.668]  Then you're putting a system that the FBI has access to in every law enforcement agency in the country.
[02:42:25.968 --> 02:42:27.991]  And that is not supposed to happen.
[02:42:28.011 --> 02:42:29.192]  That's a social credit score.
[02:42:29.312 --> 02:42:30.954]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[02:42:31.194 --> 02:42:32.816]  And so we're trying to stop little things like that.
[02:42:32.856 --> 02:42:34.457]  This is not China, you know.
[02:42:35.338 --> 02:42:42.045]  This is the United States of America, and we're founded on firearms, and we're not supposed to be, you know, tracked down and traced down like this.
[02:42:42.085 --> 02:42:44.928]  We don't have a registry, and they're creating... Well, take this building.
[02:42:45.048 --> 02:42:47.250]  It's full of people looking silk carriers and guns everywhere.
[02:42:47.591 --> 02:42:48.432]  I feel totally safe.
[02:42:49.500 --> 02:42:50.400]  And that's the way it's supposed to be.
[02:42:50.500 --> 02:42:50.660]  Yeah.
[02:42:50.781 --> 02:42:51.161]  That's right.
[02:42:51.381 --> 02:42:52.621]  I like to carry three guns on me.
[02:42:52.661 --> 02:42:54.002]  I got three guns on me now, so.
[02:42:55.062 --> 02:42:57.263]  And, you know, that's our right.
[02:42:57.423 --> 02:42:58.564]  And that's why I love the United States.
[02:42:58.584 --> 02:42:59.804]  And I feel super safe being here with you.
[02:42:59.944 --> 02:43:00.244]  That's right.
[02:43:00.284 --> 02:43:01.385]  That's why I love Texas.
[02:43:01.665 --> 02:43:02.225]  Love this state.
[02:43:03.686 --> 02:43:04.626]  We're going to come back from break.
[02:43:04.646 --> 02:43:05.426]  What do you want to hit next?
[02:43:06.387 --> 02:43:08.488]  You know, what's this book about, Alex?
[02:43:09.168 --> 02:43:10.368]  Oh, The Great Recession and the War for the World?
[02:43:10.388 --> 02:43:10.729]  Yeah.
[02:43:11.009 --> 02:43:12.229]  About the whole new war program.
[02:43:12.729 --> 02:43:12.829]  Oh.
[02:43:14.670 --> 02:43:15.951]  That's all out in the open now, isn't it?
[02:43:16.151 --> 02:43:16.731]  It's out in the open.
[02:43:17.952 --> 02:43:20.173]  Well, we got to support Central Texas Gun Works.
[02:43:20.573 --> 02:43:21.874]  That's where I got my concealed carry.
[02:43:21.914 --> 02:43:22.834]  Everybody should go there.
[02:43:23.294 --> 02:43:25.075]  CentralTexasGunWorks.com.
[02:43:25.676 --> 02:43:28.457]  Folks, if you're in Central Texas, they're the place to get your concealed carry.
[02:43:28.837 --> 02:43:31.578]  And like you said, sure, it's open carry now, but you should still get the training.
[02:43:31.938 --> 02:43:32.459]  We'll be right back.
[02:43:32.479 --> 02:43:32.779]  Stay with us.
[02:43:33.746 --> 02:43:39.371]  Final segment with Michael Cargill before the war room starts in about 15 minutes with Owen Schroer.
[02:43:39.732 --> 02:43:42.034]  And Michael Cargill's office is right down the street from our office.
[02:43:42.074 --> 02:43:46.198]  He'll be on American Journal this week in the mornings and on the war room.
[02:43:46.858 --> 02:43:48.019]  Michael Cargill, incredible.
[02:43:48.260 --> 02:43:50.161]  We've got 11 minutes left before this hour ends.
[02:43:50.522 --> 02:43:51.483]  You've got the floor, my friend.
[02:43:52.263 --> 02:43:54.866]  You know, Alex, I do want to talk about the FBI stats.
[02:43:54.906 --> 02:43:58.270]  You know, we've been talking about getting put in the FBI system.
[02:43:58.710 --> 02:44:03.015]  Well, there's a report that came out this week or last week that their stats are flawed.
[02:44:03.475 --> 02:44:04.757]  You know, something's not right.
[02:44:04.857 --> 02:44:06.819]  The data's, you know... Well, they ignore the Citigroup.
[02:44:07.019 --> 02:44:07.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:10.042]  So, you know, you can't depend on that stuff.
[02:44:11.724 --> 02:44:16.527]  There's so many different new gun laws you gotta watch out for out there, too, that are hitting us.
[02:44:16.607 --> 02:44:19.589]  California's coming up with some crazy stuff, Alex.
[02:44:19.649 --> 02:44:20.930]  New York is constantly doing stuff.
[02:44:20.950 --> 02:44:30.717]  You know, we actually, I've joined a group, the National Shooting Sports Foundation and some other gun owners and manufacturers, we're actually suing the state of New York.
[02:44:30.917 --> 02:44:42.285]   Because the state of New York, Alex, says that if I sell a gun here in Austin, in Texas, and somehow that gun gets sold and used in a crime, Wow.
[02:44:42.325 --> 02:44:43.926]  Yeah, what do you know?
[02:44:43.966 --> 02:44:45.647]  You just won all the big lawsuits.
[02:44:46.067 --> 02:44:47.448]  You should be the NRA director.
[02:44:47.468 --> 02:44:48.749]  I'm not just saying that.
[02:44:48.568 --> 02:44:52.487]   on the offense. Once again, I reached out to the National Shooter Sports Foundation.
[02:44:52.487 --> 02:44:54.888]  Yeah, what do you know? You just won all the big lawsuits.
[02:44:54.888 --> 02:44:56.088]  You should be the NRA director.
[02:44:56.088 --> 02:44:59.288]   I'm not just saying that. This guy should be the NRA director.
[02:44:59.288 --> 02:45:05.608]   So I went with, you know, reached out to Smith & Wesson, Glock, you know, some of the great,
[02:45:05.608 --> 02:45:08.927]   huge manufacturers out there, and I said, "We need to stop this."
[02:45:08.981 --> 02:45:15.383]  So we all joined together and filed a lawsuit against the state of New York, and we're trying to get them to stop it.
[02:45:15.443 --> 02:45:22.286]  That's so, like, you just won the biggest case of the new century, and you're involved, you got everybody else through the other cases.
[02:45:22.426 --> 02:45:22.666]  That's right.
[02:45:22.686 --> 02:45:24.066]  Like, why aren't they leaders?
[02:45:24.166 --> 02:45:25.007]  Why is it you?
[02:45:25.227 --> 02:45:27.688]  I mean, you're a great guy, I love you, but what is going on here?
[02:45:28.488 --> 02:45:29.948]  I don't get it.
[02:45:30.289 --> 02:45:32.909]  Folks, you don't know, this guy's behind all the resistance.
[02:45:33.389 --> 02:45:34.070]  How are you doing it?
[02:45:34.490 --> 02:45:35.270]  It's a lot.
[02:45:35.470 --> 02:45:36.190]  It really is.
[02:45:36.910 --> 02:45:38.411]  It keeps me going seven days a week.
[02:45:38.471 --> 02:45:40.151]  But I love this stuff, Alex.
[02:45:40.311 --> 02:45:40.851]  I love this.
[02:45:40.891 --> 02:45:41.752]  This is about freedom.
[02:45:41.812 --> 02:45:43.832]  This is about all Americans.
[02:45:43.852 --> 02:45:47.013]  This is not about white, black... Oh, it's the universal right of defense.
[02:45:47.053 --> 02:45:47.413]  That's right.
[02:45:47.833 --> 02:45:49.494]  Everyone has a right to a defense.
[02:45:49.614 --> 02:45:50.174]  And we gotta...
[02:45:51.775 --> 02:45:53.617]  Gotta maintain this momentum, I'm telling you now.
[02:45:53.637 --> 02:46:00.306]  And you were mentioning the Houston shooter, who they're now looking for, where the guy comes with a fake gun, but real threatening people, the guy kills them.
[02:46:00.426 --> 02:46:00.606]  Right.
[02:46:01.380 --> 02:46:02.260]  Justified shooting.
[02:46:02.300 --> 02:46:04.241]  I'm telling you right now, that guy's a hero.
[02:46:04.801 --> 02:46:16.124]  If you take a look at this Houston, and Houston, Texas has happened, I guess, this past week, where a guy goes in to a restaurant and one of the customers pulls out his gun, shoots this guy.
[02:46:16.244 --> 02:46:16.624]  Bam.
[02:46:16.724 --> 02:46:17.344]  Justified.
[02:46:17.404 --> 02:46:21.805]  In Texas, if you can actually shoot someone in the back, you're justified in shooting them in the back.
[02:46:21.845 --> 02:46:25.947]  If you're trying to recover some property that you've taken from you, immediately after, in fresh pursuit.
[02:46:25.967 --> 02:46:26.727]  Well, you just robbed people.
[02:46:26.747 --> 02:46:27.527]  He's aiming guns at them.
[02:46:27.847 --> 02:46:35.412]  So since he stole money from everyone inside the restaurant, that gun owner had the right to actually shoot this guy and stop him right there.
[02:46:35.912 --> 02:46:40.875]  Now the problem is, is maybe a couple extra shots or something like that, that may be an issue.
[02:46:40.955 --> 02:46:41.815]  They're looking for him now.
[02:46:41.855 --> 02:46:44.437]  Right, and the fact that he left, that may be an issue.
[02:46:44.717 --> 02:46:50.941]  So I'm telling this guy, if this guy can hear me, you need to lower up, get yourself an attorney, and let your attorney speak to law enforcement.
[02:46:51.101 --> 02:46:52.622]  And you'll be the new Cal Rittenhouse.
[02:46:52.722 --> 02:46:54.543]  That's right, don't speak to law enforcement by yourself.
[02:46:54.563 --> 02:46:57.265]  Because if they want to question you, then they're trying to charge you.
[02:46:57.705 --> 02:46:58.926]  Give this man advice.
[02:46:59.506 --> 02:47:00.606]  So, that would be my advice.
[02:47:00.666 --> 02:47:02.047]  You know, reach out, get an attorney.
[02:47:02.367 --> 02:47:03.568]  Reach out to Texas U.S.
[02:47:03.648 --> 02:47:05.028]  Law Shield since you're in Texas.
[02:47:05.048 --> 02:47:06.549]  They're actually located in Houston.
[02:47:07.229 --> 02:47:10.851]  Reach out to them, become a member, and see if they will actually represent you.
[02:47:11.171 --> 02:47:13.392]  And let an attorney speak for you.
[02:47:14.272 --> 02:47:16.893]  Don't speak to police by yourself, because you have a right to remain silent.
[02:47:16.973 --> 02:47:21.956]  Anything you say can and will- But you can't blame him when a gun's pointed at him, he's being threatened, and he fired a few extra shots.
[02:47:21.996 --> 02:47:22.576]  Your blood's up.
[02:47:22.756 --> 02:47:23.036]  That's right.
[02:47:23.076 --> 02:47:31.783]  As a gun owner, your job is to act and to save lives, save yourself, save other people, and then you let an attorney represent you and say... Well, once I'm to the point to shoot somebody, I'm gonna empty it.
[02:47:31.843 --> 02:47:32.564]  I mean, you can't help it.
[02:47:32.584 --> 02:47:36.007]  I mean, it's like, if some bitch is aiming a gun at you, threatening you, I mean, you know.
[02:47:36.207 --> 02:47:44.374]  That's why it's important to let the attorney speak for you and explain that and express, you know, how you are feeling and actually have them relate that to what the law says in the state that you're in.
[02:47:44.394 --> 02:47:47.436]  Because once you get ready to kill somebody, I mean, you can't blame people.
[02:47:47.617 --> 02:47:48.057]  No, you can't.
[02:47:48.357 --> 02:47:49.038]  You can't.
[02:47:49.058 --> 02:47:50.119]  They're caught in the momentum.
[02:47:50.159 --> 02:47:51.040]  Their fingers are moving.
[02:47:51.060 --> 02:47:53.182]  Their brain is processing at one speed.
[02:47:53.202 --> 02:47:54.723]  Their body's processing at a totally different speed.
[02:47:54.743 --> 02:47:56.905]  And if your brain's willing to kill somebody, it wants to go all the way.
[02:47:57.005 --> 02:47:57.386]  That's right.
[02:47:57.686 --> 02:48:01.249]  And so that's why I say this guy was fully justified in what he was doing.
[02:48:01.269 --> 02:48:02.350]  This guy's a hero.
[02:48:02.691 --> 02:48:05.213]  And I think he was in total shock is why he left.
[02:48:05.533 --> 02:48:06.895]  So I'm not mad about that.
[02:48:06.955 --> 02:48:08.056]  You know, I totally get that.
[02:48:08.116 --> 02:48:09.557]  In the video, he gets mad after he kills him.
[02:48:09.577 --> 02:48:10.278]  He didn't want to do it.
[02:48:10.458 --> 02:48:14.280]  But you go through little phases, you go through little emotional phases, and people don't understand that.
[02:48:14.481 --> 02:48:16.082]  Because he actually just shot and killed someone.
[02:48:16.122 --> 02:48:28.089]  It's the whole totality of the system, of the situation of being in a restaurant, other customers giving them their money back, and the fact that this is sinking in, I just... And the guy aimed a gun at him.
[02:48:28.409 --> 02:48:29.090]  He aimed it right at him.
[02:48:29.350 --> 02:48:29.910]  Right at his head.
[02:48:30.531 --> 02:48:30.931]  That's right.
[02:48:31.191 --> 02:48:32.412]  And so he did the right thing.
[02:48:32.452 --> 02:48:33.513]  This guy's a hero.
[02:48:33.813 --> 02:48:34.253]  He's a hero.
[02:48:34.273 --> 02:48:35.154]  He deserves a parade.
[02:48:36.174 --> 02:48:36.634]  Continue.
[02:48:38.095 --> 02:48:39.995]  There's so many different cases like this.
[02:48:40.095 --> 02:48:43.937]  I actually have a radio show I do called Come and Talk It.
[02:48:44.597 --> 02:48:46.378]  It's actually on your website.
[02:48:46.658 --> 02:48:47.278]  Banned on video.
[02:48:47.398 --> 02:48:48.158]  That's right, it's unbanned.
[02:48:48.498 --> 02:48:54.140]  And so we go over a lot of these different things on Come and Talk It on the radio show, where we break this stuff down.
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:58.482]  Let me ask this, what would you have done, because you're really good with this, what would you have done to have that happen?
[02:48:58.502 --> 02:48:59.302]  In a situation like that?
[02:48:59.622 --> 02:49:00.542]  Maybe just shoot him once.
[02:49:00.562 --> 02:49:01.903]  Nah, exact same thing.
[02:49:02.903 --> 02:49:11.806]  Probably the exact same thing, because I'm going to get caught up in what's going on and I may have unloaded it because, you know, my brain is saying one thing, my body... It's like when a cop's getting shot and he unloads.
[02:49:11.906 --> 02:49:12.266]  That's right.
[02:49:12.626 --> 02:49:16.147]  So I can totally see how this guy totally unloaded and fired everything.
[02:49:16.367 --> 02:49:19.408]  Well, they get mad at a cop when a guy shoots at a cop and the cop unloads.
[02:49:19.588 --> 02:49:20.308]  What do you expect?
[02:49:20.568 --> 02:49:20.749]  Right.
[02:49:21.429 --> 02:49:21.909]  It happens.
[02:49:21.929 --> 02:49:28.691]  You're getting caught up in the moment and you're, like I said, your brain is thinking one thing and processing at one speed and your body's processing at a totally different speed.
[02:49:29.331 --> 02:49:32.192]  So I can totally see why... And when the brain goes in kill mode, that's it.
[02:49:32.412 --> 02:49:32.792]  That's right.
[02:49:32.812 --> 02:49:34.293]  And I can totally see how this guy did this.
[02:49:34.933 --> 02:49:36.514]  So it makes totally good sense to me.
[02:49:36.534 --> 02:49:37.995]  And like I said, he is a hero.
[02:49:38.675 --> 02:49:41.016]  But we go over all these things on the radio show that we do.
[02:49:41.036 --> 02:49:42.017]  It's called Come and Talk It.
[02:49:42.317 --> 02:49:43.277]  It's a gun talk show.
[02:49:43.297 --> 02:49:44.478]  We only talk firearms.
[02:49:44.518 --> 02:49:45.518]  We talk gun laws.
[02:49:45.939 --> 02:49:47.599]  We talk about different situations.
[02:49:47.799 --> 02:49:48.980]  And we just don't talk about it.
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:50.681]  Where do they find Come and Talk It?
[02:49:51.121 --> 02:49:54.122]  It's on band.video.
[02:49:54.782 --> 02:49:55.803]  But it's a lot of places, I know.
[02:49:56.183 --> 02:49:57.603]  Well, we've got five minutes left.
[02:49:57.623 --> 02:49:59.724]  What else do you want to add to folks?
[02:50:00.824 --> 02:50:07.306]  You know, Alex, I want people to really go to our GoFundMe page and help us out a little bit with these cases.
[02:50:07.326 --> 02:50:11.127]  Because like I said, there's so many... Fund somebody that has the biggest second minute win in 20 years?
[02:50:11.267 --> 02:50:11.728]  That's right.
[02:50:11.808 --> 02:50:12.388]  Oh, that's horrible.
[02:50:12.408 --> 02:50:12.868]  I don't do that.
[02:50:13.448 --> 02:50:15.649]  There's so much, you know, so much that we're trying to work on.
[02:50:16.170 --> 02:50:17.070]  We're trying to get done.
[02:50:17.470 --> 02:50:20.392]  And I think we have the momentum.
[02:50:20.432 --> 02:50:22.073]  We have the attorneys.
[02:50:22.173 --> 02:50:23.174]  We have the team.
[02:50:23.234 --> 02:50:27.096]  It's Michael Cargill versus DOJ and ATF at GoFundMe.com.
[02:50:27.176 --> 02:50:27.596]  That's right.
[02:50:28.017 --> 02:50:29.077]  And we're trying to get it done.
[02:50:29.498 --> 02:50:30.678]  And listeners want us to fight.
[02:50:30.958 --> 02:50:31.679]  We're fighting.
[02:50:32.299 --> 02:50:32.840]  I'm fighting.
[02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:33.640]  Michael's fighting.
[02:50:33.940 --> 02:50:34.420]  We're here.
[02:50:34.581 --> 02:50:35.461]  You want to support us?
[02:50:35.981 --> 02:50:37.182]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:50:37.542 --> 02:50:38.403]  Band out video.
[02:50:38.763 --> 02:50:39.363]  Share the links.
[02:50:39.784 --> 02:50:41.425]  Go to the GoFundMe.
[02:50:41.465 --> 02:50:41.965]  We're fighting.
[02:50:42.185 --> 02:50:42.566]  That's right.
[02:50:43.987 --> 02:50:46.150]  And you know, we're trying to educate people.
[02:50:46.370 --> 02:50:53.859]  I like to travel around different states, different cities and educate people on all of this stuff because I've been doing this for 20 years now.
[02:50:54.280 --> 02:50:57.964]  And people ask me, well, you know, Michael, how did you get to this point?
[02:50:58.325 --> 02:50:59.106]  Well, you know what I did?
[02:50:59.647 --> 02:51:00.668]  Your family got robbed.
[02:51:00.888 --> 02:51:01.908]  Yeah, that too.
[02:51:01.928 --> 02:51:07.150]  And then also 20 years ago, you know, that stuff like that happened and I started going out and educating people.
[02:51:07.550 --> 02:51:19.334]  It got to the point where I've educated so many people over my 20 years of experience that now there's probably not a courtroom where there's a clerk that has not taken a class with me.
[02:51:19.854 --> 02:51:24.056]   There's, you know, where there's a You got a posse.
[02:51:24.056 --> 02:51:25.935]  Yeah, they're all over the place.
[02:51:25.935 --> 02:51:31.255]   They've actually sat down when they were in college at UT or Texas A&M or Texas Tech or
[02:51:31.255 --> 02:51:36.495]   some other university where I've spoken to them about gun laws and certain situations
[02:51:36.495 --> 02:51:38.895]  and now those people are leaders now.
[02:51:38.895 --> 02:51:42.415]   And that's where it started 20 years ago and I'd like to continue this and that's how the
[02:51:42.415 --> 02:51:45.415]   momentum you know, that's how it all started right then and there.
[02:51:45.441 --> 02:51:50.045]  20 years ago, educating people, all the different colleges around the state of Texas.
[02:51:50.426 --> 02:51:51.607]  Now these people are leaders.
[02:51:51.647 --> 02:51:53.048]  They're in the different offices here.
[02:51:53.108 --> 02:51:54.389]  They're at the Capitol.
[02:51:54.670 --> 02:51:57.452]  They're working at the governor's office, the lieutenant governor's office.
[02:51:57.472 --> 02:51:58.513]  They're in D.C.
[02:51:58.573 --> 02:51:59.914]  And again, I'm a good person.
[02:51:59.934 --> 02:52:00.595]  I have a gun.
[02:52:00.615 --> 02:52:01.496]  I'm protecting people.
[02:52:01.616 --> 02:52:07.339]  Yes, and so by educating them, that helps everyone, and now these people are leaders, and guess what?
[02:52:07.359 --> 02:52:08.300]  They're making a decision.
[02:52:08.460 --> 02:52:20.267]  And so that's why I say this is a perfect time for us to get these cases here right now to the Supreme Court, because this Supreme Court is going to be the court that actually puts these federal agencies in check and shuts them down.

[02:52:22.708 --> 02:52:24.709]  We've got about a minute until we end the show.
[02:52:25.089 --> 02:52:26.490]  Owen Troyer takes over the War Room.
[02:52:26.950 --> 02:52:27.811]  What else do you want to add, friend?
[02:52:28.786 --> 02:52:29.527]  That's about it, Alex.
[02:52:29.587 --> 02:52:30.487]  I mean, that's all I got.
[02:52:30.668 --> 02:52:35.532]  And I just want people to continue to support us, because I think we're doing the Lord's work here.
[02:52:35.572 --> 02:52:37.974]  Like I always say, you know, more guns equals less crime.
[02:52:37.994 --> 02:52:39.655]  So definitely go out there and buy yourself a gun.
[02:52:39.675 --> 02:52:42.478]  And there's nothing like praising the Lord and passing ammunition.
[02:52:43.635 --> 02:52:43.995]  Beautiful.
[02:52:44.015 --> 02:52:45.497]  How do folks come take classes from you?
[02:52:45.517 --> 02:52:46.498]  How do they buy guns from you?
[02:52:46.739 --> 02:52:47.139]  That's right.
[02:52:47.740 --> 02:52:51.624]  So, you know, continue to support us because we're doing, like I said, the Lord's work here.
[02:52:51.944 --> 02:52:53.066]  We're trying to get this stuff done.
[02:52:53.266 --> 02:52:56.610]  This is about all of us, not just, this is not about me.
[02:52:56.690 --> 02:52:59.713]  This is not about just, you know, this city.
[02:52:59.773 --> 02:53:00.754]  This is about the state.
[02:53:00.814 --> 02:53:03.557]   This is about other states, all It's about the whole world.

[02:53:24.150 --> 02:53:31.430]   Let's come together, support Michael Cargill, support InfoWars, do it now, because We are winning.
[02:53:32.251 --> 02:53:32.811]  20 seconds left.
[02:53:32.851 --> 02:53:33.711]  What's coming next, Michael?
[02:53:34.151 --> 02:53:37.652]  What's coming next is we're bringing this case to the Supreme Court.
[02:53:37.692 --> 02:53:42.574]  We're hoping to have this case by May, June, July, this court in 2023.
[02:53:43.014 --> 02:53:47.875]  So we want, whatever happens, we want to hear a ruling from this court by next Christmas, next winter.
[02:53:48.335 --> 02:53:53.837]  So that way all bump stocks, bump stocks will be legal across the entire United States.
[02:53:54.497 --> 02:53:57.884]  And then their special rulemaking to ban everything else outside law will be killed.
[02:53:58.044 --> 02:53:58.445]  That's right.
[02:53:58.465 --> 02:53:59.747]  We're going to shut them down and stop them.
[02:53:59.768 --> 02:54:00.529]  Great job, Michael.
[02:54:00.729 --> 02:54:01.010]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:01.030 --> 02:54:01.250]  Thank you.
[02:54:01.270 --> 02:54:01.731]  Love you, brother.
[02:54:02.232 --> 02:54:03.555]  Powerful information.
[02:54:03.735 --> 02:54:21.735]  War Room coming up now on InfoWars.
[02:54:21.884 --> 02:54:22.425]  You're on the air.
[02:54:22.445 --> 02:54:22.945]  Thanks for calling.
[02:54:23.145 --> 02:54:25.087]  Honored to be talking with you, Alex.
[02:54:25.307 --> 02:54:30.290]  I've been listening since 2016, and I am a financial supporter ever since.
[02:54:30.470 --> 02:54:30.790]  Thank you.
[02:54:30.930 --> 02:54:33.692]  I'd like to promote your nitric oxide product.
[02:54:33.973 --> 02:54:37.395]  I actually marketed a competitor for 20 years.
[02:54:37.595 --> 02:54:42.959]  I've done over $30 million in that product, so I know a little bit about nitric oxide.
[02:54:43.059 --> 02:54:55.176]   It is According to the Nobel Prize in Medicine 1998, it is the key signaling molecule to the entire cardiovascular system, and it is used by every single cell in the human body.
[02:54:55.276 --> 02:55:01.601]   And the reason that we can't generate as much as we get older, is because the lining of the arteries, the endothelial
[02:55:01.601 --> 02:55:03.200]  lining, gets damaged.
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:05.200]  And that's where it gets generated.
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:11.000]   So when you're taking nitric oxide, all the other products that your listeners are taking work better.
[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.601]  Because it's like putting a pump in a fish tank.
[02:55:13.601 --> 02:55:19.100]   Everything circulates. It regulates the whole arteries and the arterial system.
[02:55:19.100 --> 02:55:23.100]   So I would have every one of your listeners add that product,
[02:55:23.100 --> 02:55:28.001]   and all the other products are going to work better, and they're going to protect those ACE receptors.
[02:55:28.001 --> 02:55:33.001]   Absolutely. It's Nitric Boost from InfoWars MD, the new product line.
[02:55:33.152 --> 02:55:35.872]  This is a clone that the company authorizes to do it.
[02:55:35.912 --> 02:55:40.053]  Private label by us of one of the top-selling Nitric Boost products in the country.
[02:55:40.193 --> 02:55:42.834]  Already tested, already loved, already five-star reviewed.
[02:55:42.854 --> 02:55:43.994]  We're now able to private label it.
[02:55:44.054 --> 02:55:45.514]  Hope everybody gets Nitric Boost.
[02:55:45.674 --> 02:55:51.515]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com under the InfoWars MD line of products.
[02:55:51.535 --> 02:55:53.896]  And then it funds the InfoWars 360 win.
[02:55:54.036 --> 02:55:55.736]  Everybody should get Nitric Boost today.
[02:55:55.936 --> 02:56:00.263]  You're watching the American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[02:56:00.684 --> 02:56:02.387]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:56:02.707 --> 02:56:06.253]  This is The War Room with Owen Troyer.
[02:56:06.433 --> 02:56:10.580]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:56:13.752 --> 02:56:15.494]  There is a war on for your mind.
[02:56:15.935 --> 02:56:17.356]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[02:56:17.737 --> 02:56:18.978]  This is an information war.
[02:56:19.799 --> 02:56:23.964]  Infowars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[02:56:24.504 --> 02:56:29.944]   And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all
[02:56:29.944 --> 02:56:35.783]   using the terms that InfoWars has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations
[02:56:35.783 --> 02:56:37.384]  and we know how to beat them.
[02:56:37.384 --> 02:56:39.064]  But we can't do it without funding.
[02:56:39.064 --> 02:56:43.264]   We make it easy to fund with great products that empower you and your immune system and
[02:56:43.264 --> 02:56:44.264]  your family as well.
[02:56:44.264 --> 02:56:48.424]   You can also make straight donations at InfoWarsStore.com clicking on the big red banner.
[02:56:48.424 --> 02:56:51.863]  A one-time, a recurring, but I'm asking you to take action.
[02:56:51.863 --> 02:56:53.043]  We're non-violent.
[02:56:53.043 --> 02:56:55.863]   But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on
[02:56:55.863 --> 02:57:00.863]   air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[02:57:00.924 --> 02:57:02.866]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[02:57:03.246 --> 02:57:04.868]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:57:05.068 --> 02:57:06.008]  We're going over the top.
[02:57:06.209 --> 02:57:07.550]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[02:57:07.730 --> 02:57:10.772]  So please go to mfulworthstore.com and donate now!
