[00:00:02.771 --> 00:00:08.560]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:13.081]  Visit InfoWars.com/show and share the link today.
[00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:26.081]  Welcome to the New World Order.
[00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.342]  This New World Order will be a new society and features lots of changes.
[00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:36.245]  This new society is great for some, and not so great for others.
[00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:41.188]  In the New World Order, you will learn to love to live more modestly.
[00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:47.692]  You do not need to own things, when you can simply lease them from your loving government-approved companies.
[00:00:48.152 --> 00:00:54.737]  We will transform our current pollution-ridden cities to something much more beautiful, and you will love it!
[00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.961]  Life in the New World Order will be, um, different.
[00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:03.604]  In this new perfect world, cash will be illegal.
[00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:11.370]  Everyone will be issued a certain amount of global credits, which will be the only way you can buy and sell in the new society.
[00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.614]  These digital financial credits will also be tied to your social credit scores.
[00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:29.275]  Your credit scores will become your digital footprint and will be used to control your travel, what you can buy, where you can live, your energy usage, medical access.
[00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.660]  Everything you do will be in a government database.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.242]  This is great!
[00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:40.653]  You will be issued more credits if you are good and promote our new system.
[00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:46.299]  Citizens will be given less global credits if they ever criticize the New World Order.
[00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:59.111]  If you are non-binary, a demented pedophile, can barely think, worship the devil, and help promote the New World Order, you will be greatly rewarded with extra credit each month.
[00:02:00.402 --> 00:02:09.149]  Since robots and AI will replace most jobs, you will have more time to play your favorite video games and watch more Netflix.
[00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.171]  This is so great!
[00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:17.744]  In the new society, parents will not be allowed to make decisions for their children.
[00:02:18.144 --> 00:02:20.165]  The government will raise your kids.
[00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:23.687]  Each child will be assigned a state-sponsored caseworker.
[00:02:24.187 --> 00:02:33.632]  These caseworkers will teach your kids that everything is racist, how to be queer or gender fluid, and teach them about all the different sex positions.
[00:02:34.252 --> 00:02:47.703]   If you object to your caseworkers teaching techniques, Or if you object to the caseworker sleeping with your child, everyone in your family will be docked global credits and your family could be relocated to a FEMA camp.
[00:02:48.643 --> 00:02:50.225]  Resistance is foolish.
[00:02:51.506 --> 00:02:52.427]  Meet Stacy.
[00:02:52.727 --> 00:02:54.969]  Stacy is one of our best caseworkers.
[00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.032]  Stacy could be in charge of one of your kids.
[00:02:59.492 --> 00:03:00.934]  How great would that be?
[00:03:01.794 --> 00:03:05.798]  In this new world order, it's important to follow the rules.
[00:03:06.983 --> 00:03:08.905]  Certain websites will be illegal.
[00:03:08.925 --> 00:03:12.048]  Daddy, what is InfoWars.com?
[00:03:11.888 --> 00:03:23.247]  If you see something, say something.
[00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.211]  You as a citizen should report your neighbors if they aren't following the new rules.
[00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:31.553]  You have the power to make the world better.
[00:03:32.073 --> 00:03:35.334]  Caring, Reporting, Assisting, Progressive.
[00:03:35.634 --> 00:03:37.335]  C-R-A-P.
[00:03:37.855 --> 00:03:39.276]  Which stands for crap.
[00:03:39.716 --> 00:03:43.678]  You too can be a piece of crap and will be greatly rewarded.
[00:03:44.478 --> 00:03:48.522]  As we see here, this man misgendered a man lady.
[00:03:49.002 --> 00:03:51.684]  The police are dealing with him in the most fitting way.
[00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:56.108]  This offender seen here did not recycle his paper straws.
[00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.373]  If you don't like this, you will be sentenced to death by lethal injection.
[00:04:03.047 --> 00:04:04.588]  Brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.633]  Things will get so bad in our society, your family will be begging for the new world order.
[00:04:11.114 --> 00:04:13.696]  You will need the government in order to survive.
[00:04:14.416 --> 00:04:26.526]  In this new utopia, if you do not comply with our new laws and regulations, our totally not corrupt federal and local judges will make sure that you are given the proper penalties.
[00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:32.010]  Jail, financial ruin, death penalty, anything is possible.
[00:04:32.931 --> 00:04:38.496]  As we all adjust to the new normal, it's important to remember that you do not matter.
[00:04:38.976 --> 00:04:41.498]  Do not complain about the hyperinflation.
[00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.320]  Do not complain about the higher taxes.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.723]  And do not complain about Bill Gates' death panels.
[00:04:48.363 --> 00:04:50.105]  This is for the greater good.
[00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:53.308]  This is what I call happy making time.
[00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:56.551]  Let us all celebrate this New World Order.
[00:04:56.972 --> 00:04:58.193]  The New World Order.
[00:04:58.713 --> 00:04:59.914]  Please stay a while.
[00:05:00.375 --> 00:05:01.956]  We won't keep you for long.
[00:05:02.497 --> 00:05:04.659]  We'll keep you forever.
[00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.819]  Forever, forever, forever.
[00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.259]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:20.779]   On March 6, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:30.131]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[00:05:30.952 --> 00:05:37.018]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:05:37.359 --> 00:05:42.359]  Visit Infowars.com/show and share the link today.
[00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:52.359]  [MUSIC]
[00:05:52.359 --> 00:05:57.359]   An explosion has been reported at the Con Edison Power Plant in New York City.
[00:05:57.645 --> 00:05:59.406]  Power outages have been reported.
[00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:11.353]  This happened right on the heels of the Obama Netflix production Leave the World Behind, a racially divisive movie about cyberattacks in America and the end of life as we know it.
[00:06:11.373 --> 00:06:17.277]  We are seeing ongoing cyberattacks across the country.
[00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:22.911]  Something is happening and I don't trust them.
[00:06:24.593 --> 00:06:26.454]  Anything I know I have told you.
[00:06:26.474 --> 00:06:29.497]  I don't believe you.
[00:06:29.617 --> 00:06:31.859]  I would do anything to protect my family.
[00:06:32.098 --> 00:06:34.579]  What you do is your business.
[00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:37.079]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:38.498]  Get in the car right now.
[00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:47.338]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:06:47.338 --> 00:06:49.338]  There is no going back to norm.
[00:06:49.338 --> 00:06:52.858]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:06:52.858 --> 00:06:56.899]   And it happened just a few years after Klaus Schwab of the World
[00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:59.457]  Economic Forum told us it was coming.
[00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:09.365]  In 2020, Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum warned of an impending cyber attack that will take down all of society.
[00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:14.849]  We all know, but still pay insufficient attention.
[00:07:15.976 --> 00:07:32.499]  To the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:45.401]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack.
[00:07:48.664 --> 00:07:49.905]  Greg Reese reporting.
[00:07:50.826 --> 00:08:02.826]  [Music]
[00:08:02.826 --> 00:08:09.826]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:08:09.826 --> 00:08:17.826]  [Music]
[00:08:17.826 --> 00:08:19.826]  Info Wars has been banned.
[00:08:19.826 --> 00:08:29.826]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:08:22.177 --> 00:08:22.517]  Arrested.
[00:08:22.537 --> 00:08:27.460]  Attacked and threatened.
[00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:30.543]  Because we are effective.
[00:08:32.164 --> 00:08:33.685]  The Great Awakening is here.
[00:08:34.005 --> 00:08:35.546]  Go to Banned.Video.
[00:08:36.306 --> 00:08:38.488]  Download the videos and share.
[00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:49.503]   Support the Information War at InfoWarsStore.com And never give up the fight.
[00:08:49.884 --> 00:09:05.055]  InfoWars.com All you have to do is check out what I'm saying.
[00:09:05.315 --> 00:09:11.380]  And that's why they run the fake headline against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.841]  Jones admits he's an actor.
[00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:17.104]  Or Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously.
[00:09:18.368 --> 00:09:19.149]  Where do we say that?
[00:09:19.449 --> 00:09:20.170]  We never said that.
[00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.552]  They just say we said that.
[00:09:23.793 --> 00:09:24.573]  But where's the clip?
[00:09:24.854 --> 00:09:25.694]  Where's the article?
[00:09:25.995 --> 00:09:26.715]  Where do we say that?
[00:09:26.735 --> 00:09:27.776]  It doesn't exist.
[00:09:28.357 --> 00:09:32.420]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:35.603]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[00:09:35.843 --> 00:09:39.867]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[00:09:40.367 --> 00:09:42.288]  He's actually a performance artist.
[00:09:42.488 --> 00:09:43.768]  He's a performance artist.
[00:09:44.129 --> 00:09:45.289]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:49.691]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid.
[00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:54.353]  And it's all based on the custody battle with my ex-wife five years ago.
[00:09:54.373 --> 00:10:02.176]  And she was trying to put into evidence me dressed up more than a decade before, like the Joker, being sarcastic, saying, take your Prozac, kids.
[00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:03.536]  Take your illegal drugs, too.
[00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:04.577]  You'll die.
[00:10:04.617 --> 00:10:05.177]  It's fun.
[00:10:05.557 --> 00:10:07.258]  So people wouldn't take drugs.
[00:10:08.318 --> 00:10:11.740]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence and say, look, he's insane, telling kids to use drugs.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:18.603]  And my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's really Jack Nicholson.
[00:10:18.623 --> 00:10:20.904]  So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander.
[00:10:21.284 --> 00:10:22.465]  Hail Cobra!
[00:10:22.785 --> 00:10:23.685]  Or Optimus Prime.
[00:10:23.705 --> 00:10:25.606]  Autobots, let's roll!
[00:10:25.966 --> 00:10:28.547]  Or the Joker, because I can do imitations of them all really good.
[00:10:29.048 --> 00:10:29.728]  Or Darth Vader.
[00:10:29.948 --> 00:10:32.589]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[00:10:33.029 --> 00:10:36.111]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[00:10:37.594 --> 00:10:38.995]  Do I really think I'm Darth Vader?
[00:10:39.155 --> 00:10:39.435]  No.
[00:10:39.455 --> 00:10:41.416]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime?
[00:10:41.436 --> 00:10:42.476]  Public Commander?
[00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:42.936]  The Joker?
[00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:43.156]  No.
[00:10:43.456 --> 00:10:50.619]  And clearly, no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm saying is what I really think.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.780]  No one believes the Babylon Bee.
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.761]  It's not trying to lie to you, it's being sarcastic.
[00:10:56.082 --> 00:10:57.862]  Buy the Vaccinate Me Elmo doll today.
[00:10:58.242 --> 00:10:59.883]  It's required by the CDC.
[00:10:59.983 --> 00:11:01.304]  But they play those games.
[00:11:02.364 --> 00:11:04.526]  And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[00:11:05.026 --> 00:11:13.194]  Even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke, this isn't serious, they clip it out and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[00:11:13.834 --> 00:11:15.616]  Every day when I leave work, I do this.
[00:11:15.636 --> 00:11:17.458]  That man's a threat to this country.
[00:11:17.678 --> 00:11:19.720]  And they go, look, he admitted in court he's an actor.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.482]  Well, yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly.
[00:11:22.863 --> 00:11:24.444]  I was an actor in Waking Life.
[00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:27.266]  I was an actor when I was Cobra Commander.
[00:11:29.448 --> 00:11:37.915]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles to you isn't a real thing and isn't something I'm actually saying.
[00:11:37.935 --> 00:11:38.696]  And you know that!
[00:11:39.356 --> 00:11:40.457]  You're insulted right now.
[00:11:40.497 --> 00:11:41.738]  I'm even explaining that to you.
[00:11:42.078 --> 00:11:45.922]  And so am I. But that's who these people are.
[00:11:47.042 --> 00:11:50.185]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[00:11:51.406 --> 00:11:52.487]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:55.392]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented.
[00:11:55.633 --> 00:11:56.473]  He's smart.
[00:11:56.754 --> 00:11:58.115]  He's funny as hell.
[00:11:58.135 --> 00:11:59.156]  He's truly funny.
[00:11:58.975 --> 00:12:00.975]  I'm kind of retarded.
[00:12:00.975 --> 00:12:07.975]  [Music]
[00:12:07.975 --> 00:12:15.975]   Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, do you now not listen to what I say about other things
[00:12:15.975 --> 00:12:20.975]   when I show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola on InfoWars.com
[00:12:20.975 --> 00:12:22.975]  that has all the cited information?
[00:12:23.213 --> 00:12:25.876]  The latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome?
[00:12:26.396 --> 00:12:27.878]  No, that's a real thing.
[00:12:28.658 --> 00:12:31.081]  That's something happening in the real world.
[00:12:31.741 --> 00:12:33.323]  And that's what we're breaking down here today.
[00:12:34.608 --> 00:12:38.010]  I am Alex Jones, and I am the guy on this show every day.
[00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:45.129]   I am an American and that's what I promote is freedom and justice and liberty and they can't stand it.
[00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:59.289]  I'm a huge believer in information.
[00:12:59.513 --> 00:13:02.657]  I watch InfoWars every day and follow Alex Jones closely.
[00:13:02.677 --> 00:13:03.117]  You know why?
[00:13:03.257 --> 00:13:04.339]  He can put you ahead of the curve.
[00:13:04.739 --> 00:13:07.703]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[00:13:08.343 --> 00:13:11.567]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:13:11.888 --> 00:13:15.292]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:13:17.355 --> 00:13:20.239]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:13:20.339 --> 00:13:21.541]  This is reality.
[00:13:21.661 --> 00:13:23.183]  It's just pancakes.
[00:13:23.363 --> 00:13:25.746]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:13:25.766 --> 00:13:28.009]  A revolution of peaceful information is coming.
[00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:30.833]  And when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[00:13:30.853 --> 00:13:31.975]  You're lying to the public.
[00:13:32.295 --> 00:13:32.815]  Disgusting!
[00:13:33.075 --> 00:13:36.458]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[00:13:36.518 --> 00:13:39.319]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist.
[00:13:39.439 --> 00:13:47.364]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country, bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country.
[00:13:47.504 --> 00:13:49.546]  We're gonna get fired up about the real things!
[00:13:49.726 --> 00:13:50.846]  The things that matter!
[00:13:55.228 --> 00:13:57.228]  Burn in hell, New World Order!
[00:13:57.228 --> 00:14:07.228]  [Music]
[00:14:07.228 --> 00:14:13.228]   We're here with the world's most dangerous man, the most censored man in the English language.
[00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:18.435]  But honestly, when you get him in front of an outhouse in the woods, he doesn't seem so dangerous.
[00:14:19.356 --> 00:14:20.197]  So fancy outhouse.
[00:14:22.594 --> 00:14:31.437]  We have a ruling class in the United States defined by its hatreds, not its loves, not its hopes, but by its hatreds.
[00:14:31.577 --> 00:14:41.180]  They hate all kinds of people, large groups of people, the deplorables, the bitter clingers, America's entire blue-collar population, the unfashionable people.
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.041]  They're hated by the people who run our country.
[00:14:44.708 --> 00:14:49.071]  But no one is hated more by them than a man called Alex Jones.
[00:14:49.671 --> 00:14:54.574]  Alex Jones is the single most censored man in all American history.
[00:14:55.074 --> 00:14:58.637]  He was the first media figure in our history to be completely erased in one day.
[00:14:58.917 --> 00:14:59.857]  Deplatformed.
[00:14:59.977 --> 00:15:03.239]  Alex Jones was deplatformed before it was a common term.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.381]  And not just deplatformed.
[00:15:06.041 --> 00:15:06.401]  Sued.
[00:15:07.502 --> 00:15:08.022]  Attacked.
[00:15:08.643 --> 00:15:10.424]  They attempted to criminally charge him.
[00:15:11.204 --> 00:15:12.585]  What did Alex Jones do wrong?
[00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.051]  Alex Jones didn't rape anybody.
[00:15:15.071 --> 00:15:16.973]  He didn't loot Macy's.
[00:15:17.393 --> 00:15:19.075]  He didn't burn a police station.
[00:15:19.575 --> 00:15:23.158]  He didn't invent a fake cryptocurrency and loot pension funds.
[00:15:23.178 --> 00:15:27.381]  He didn't start a pointless war that made this country poorer and more disorganized.
[00:15:27.401 --> 00:15:28.802]  He didn't open the southern border.
[00:15:28.882 --> 00:15:34.707]  No, Alex Jones had opinions that deeply rattled the people who run America.
[00:15:34.807 --> 00:15:36.108]  In fact, rattled a lot of us.
[00:15:36.188 --> 00:15:43.368]   And I'll just confess that I first heard of Alex Jones When he questioned the official story behind 9-11.
[00:15:43.408 --> 00:15:45.870]  And I, speaking for myself, was deeply offended by this.
[00:15:46.950 --> 00:16:01.300]  I didn't take any time to find out what he was saying, but I was bothered by the idea that this defining event in American history, which changed the life of everyone who lived here then, might not actually have unfolded as we were told it did.
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.802]  And that possibility was too destabilizing.
[00:16:03.822 --> 00:16:06.724]  And I remember feeling resentment toward Alex Jones for saying that.
[00:16:07.677 --> 00:16:14.384]  But several years later, I went up in Austin, Texas, and through a chain of circumstances, wound up meeting Alex Jones.
[00:16:15.165 --> 00:16:20.851]  And I learned what everyone who has met him now knows, which is Alex Jones is not a crazy person.
[00:16:21.311 --> 00:16:24.375]  Alex Jones has said pretty far out things on TV from time to time.
[00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:26.232]  Not that far out.
[00:16:26.392 --> 00:16:29.755]  He hasn't said men can become women, or Ukraine is a democracy.
[00:16:30.295 --> 00:16:33.097]  But within the bounds of, say, cable news, pretty far out.
[00:16:33.938 --> 00:16:37.561]  But fundamentally, Alex Jones is right about a lot of things.
[00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:39.522]  And in fact, that's why they don't like him.
[00:16:40.343 --> 00:16:45.967]  Alex Jones has an uncanny, really an amazing ability to predict events before they happen.
[00:16:46.067 --> 00:16:50.491]  He has called it and he's done it on tape again and again, to the point where it's a meme on the internet.
[00:16:50.991 --> 00:16:52.192]  Alex Jones profit.
[00:16:52.432 --> 00:16:54.054]  Not conspiracy nut, profit.
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:00.643]  But when you dig into Alex Jones's predictions, they are so spot on that it's remarkable.
[00:17:01.203 --> 00:17:01.943]  How does he do this?
[00:17:02.224 --> 00:17:05.785]  We're guessing there's a kind of spiritual sensitivity to Alex Jones.
[00:17:05.825 --> 00:17:06.786]  Maybe that's his secret.
[00:17:07.706 --> 00:17:12.829]  He was displaying this years before the average person in this country even thought about matters like that.
[00:17:12.889 --> 00:17:20.192]  Now it's pretty obvious to most people that the current war going on in this country is taking place in ways you can't see it most of the time.
[00:17:20.233 --> 00:17:22.133]  But 10 years ago, people were not thinking that way.
[00:17:22.234 --> 00:17:22.914]  Alex Jones was.
[00:17:23.737 --> 00:17:27.539]  And so we thought it'd be interesting to sit down and talk to Alex Jones, the man.
[00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:29.240]  He joins us now in our studio.
[00:17:29.761 --> 00:17:30.461]  Alex Jones, thank you.
[00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:32.282]  Wow, Tucker, it's great to be here.
[00:17:32.442 --> 00:17:35.544]  Amazing studios, amazing, I mean, amazing people.
[00:17:36.104 --> 00:17:39.166]  And this is this is really going to be, I think, a historic interview.
[00:17:39.206 --> 00:17:40.147]  So thanks for having me.
[00:17:40.187 --> 00:17:42.368]  Well, I'm really grateful to be able to do it.
[00:17:42.408 --> 00:17:56.590]   And it's just it's one of the great blessings of my life and of my job is that I've been able to meet people That I've had preconceptions about and sometimes find those preconceptions bolstered and in other cases demolished.
[00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.231]  And you're definitely in the second category.
[00:17:58.251 --> 00:18:04.914]  So I want, for people who've made it this far, you know, the people who are in the country have really succeeded in making you disreputable.
[00:18:05.686 --> 00:18:07.668]  And the whole point, of course, is people won't listen to you.
[00:18:08.268 --> 00:18:17.817]  So we thought it'd be interesting to start with a series of on-tape predictions that you made, some of which are so precise and so prescient that it makes the hair on my arms stand up.
[00:18:18.557 --> 00:18:21.560]  And I'm being sincere, and our viewers are about to see what I'm talking about.
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.523]  Here is a list of things that you called ahead of time.
[00:18:25.393 --> 00:18:33.739]  By the middle of September, that the new policy's being written, you all have to wear masks again, and so will airport employees.
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.060]  It's happening.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.402]  Mask mandates are officially back.
[00:18:37.522 --> 00:18:45.028]  We know the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to blow up airliners, Baltimore Sun, or if you let some terrorist group do it, like the World Trade Center, we know who to blame.
[00:18:45.128 --> 00:18:49.171]  And if there was an outside threat, like a bin Laden, who was a known CIA asset in the 80s.
[00:18:49.351 --> 00:18:53.614]  This group and its leader, a person named Osama bin Laden, he's the boogeyman they need.
[00:18:53.914 --> 00:18:56.415]  We're looking at a giant war in February right now.
[00:18:56.655 --> 00:18:58.595]  I predict the Russians are going to roll in.
[00:18:58.915 --> 00:18:59.555]  They're already there.
[00:18:59.575 --> 00:19:00.236]  They're going to roll in.
[00:19:00.816 --> 00:19:04.097]  With attacks across Ukraine, which is the size of Texas.
[00:19:04.337 --> 00:19:05.737]  It really was the Iraqis.
[00:19:05.757 --> 00:19:07.517]  That's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq.
[00:19:07.978 --> 00:19:09.098]  What a beautiful setup.
[00:19:09.978 --> 00:19:11.498]  Those 9-11 clips are crazy.
[00:19:11.959 --> 00:19:14.679]  I'm actually bothered by the precision of them.
[00:19:14.699 --> 00:19:16.300]  I'm not accusing you of being behind 9-11.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:22.807]   But how could you, in July of 2001, Call that.
[00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:31.073]  You said they're going to have airliners fly into the World Trade Center and they're going to blame a guy called Osama Bin Laden.
[00:19:31.333 --> 00:19:35.076]  Leaving aside what actually happened, how could you have known that?
[00:19:35.776 --> 00:19:38.799]  Well, in the longer clips, it's a multi-hour show from July 25th, 2001.
[00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:51.291]  I specifically walked through all the reasons and I knew they were hyping up that we were about to be hit by Osama Bin Laden.
[00:19:51.331 --> 00:19:58.137]  I knew that the World Trade Center had been attacked the first time and that the Fed's been involved helping cook the bomb and allowing it to go forward.
[00:19:58.578 --> 00:20:02.601]  And I just saw a lot of the pre-programming that was happening in the media.
[00:20:03.422 --> 00:20:06.745]  Because they were on the news saying, you know, life's about to change in America.
[00:20:07.145 --> 00:20:10.308]  And I was reading what the Rand Corporation was saying and what the Pentagon was putting out.
[00:20:10.828 --> 00:20:16.833]  I read the PNAC document from a year before, Rebuilding America's Defenses, that Dick Cheney had helped write.
[00:20:17.353 --> 00:20:27.341]  And it said we need a Pearl Harbor event on the American homeland to be able to bring in this police state and this control and then expand the American empire worldwide.
[00:20:27.381 --> 00:20:31.765]  So hundreds of pieces of data, hundreds of pieces of data went into that prediction.
[00:20:33.328 --> 00:20:36.151]  But terrorists are going to hit the World Trade Center in July of 2001?
[00:20:36.791 --> 00:20:38.513]  I lived in the United States then.
[00:20:38.733 --> 00:20:40.615]  That was the last thing on my mind.
[00:20:41.256 --> 00:20:42.237]  And I lived in Washington.
[00:20:42.257 --> 00:20:45.180]  I know the guys who wrote the PNAC document, because I shared an office with them.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.522]  So I was more informed than the average person.
[00:20:48.162 --> 00:20:52.266]  And that was the last thing that crossed my mind in the summer of 2001.
[00:20:53.247 --> 00:20:54.629]  Like everyone else, I thought it was a Cessna.
[00:20:55.249 --> 00:20:57.732]  But how convinced were you that this was going to happen?
[00:20:58.863 --> 00:20:59.804]  I was completely convinced.
[00:20:59.824 --> 00:21:04.188]  In fact, in the full clip that's online, you can find it on Twitter and other places, it has been removed.
[00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:15.458]  I explained to people that they need to call the White House and tell the White House, we know if you allow these attacks that you're basically allowing it to happen.
[00:21:16.099 --> 00:21:19.382]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:21:19.442 --> 00:21:21.243]  This normally happens about once a year.
[00:21:21.263 --> 00:21:24.206]  It actually happened last week and it happened today.
[00:21:24.266 --> 00:21:29.212]   A piece of equipment Just crapped out on us an IP address.
[00:21:29.252 --> 00:21:31.653]  So right when I went live, the microphone cut out.
[00:21:32.253 --> 00:21:34.414]  So I wasn't just playing golf or something the last 30 minutes.
[00:21:34.434 --> 00:21:35.975]  We were running around like chickens with our heads cut off.
[00:21:36.455 --> 00:21:40.396]  We got a huge guest, Mike Adams, breaking major AI news in the second and third hour.
[00:21:40.697 --> 00:21:41.597]  I'm going to co-host with him.
[00:21:42.017 --> 00:21:45.939]  Jack Posobiec has become a big scandal that we said NATO's mobilizing for war.
[00:21:45.979 --> 00:21:46.499]  He's coming on.
[00:21:47.019 --> 00:21:47.980]  This is a big deal.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.721]  We've got this high-level FBI.
[00:21:51.849 --> 00:21:55.112]  Chief who basically ran the Russia collusion hoax against Trump.
[00:21:55.493 --> 00:21:59.877]  He's just been sentenced to a long time in federal prison for being a spy of Putin.
[00:22:00.537 --> 00:22:01.719]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:22:02.579 --> 00:22:06.984]  Also, congressmen are saying they're going down these people on their high perch.
[00:22:07.384 --> 00:22:10.427]  They've confirmed that feds were in the buses and driving the buses on January 6.
[00:22:11.008 --> 00:22:12.990]  There were hundreds of them in the crowd, as we already told you.
[00:22:14.131 --> 00:22:14.871]  That's all coming up.
[00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:19.329]  I'm hosting the fourth hour today, so you'll get your three-plus hours of Jones.
[00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:24.872]  But this, I was so ready, like a racehorse out of the gate, and then the damn equipment went down.
[00:22:25.092 --> 00:22:26.013]  When it rains, it pours.
[00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:26.693]  But we're here.
[00:22:27.113 --> 00:22:27.954]  We're live.
[00:22:28.234 --> 00:22:29.675]  Welcome all the Twitter audience tuning in.
[00:22:29.695 --> 00:22:31.295]  We're going to cover it all in four minutes.
[00:22:31.315 --> 00:22:31.696]  Stay with us.
[00:22:32.056 --> 00:22:35.297]  All right, I've been on the air, it'll be 30 years in April.
[00:22:37.238 --> 00:22:41.641]  And in the last decade or so, maybe once a year, I would say this is the most important show I've ever done.
[00:22:42.506 --> 00:22:43.547]  Because the quickening's here.
[00:22:43.607 --> 00:22:46.028]  Things are getting crazy all over the world, not just the U.S.
[00:22:46.529 --> 00:22:52.432]  And so more often than not, I would say this is the most important broadcast we've ever done, at least once a year or so.
[00:22:53.433 --> 00:23:04.780]  But in the last few years, every few months I say this is the most important broadcast we've ever done, or at least the subjects I'm about to cover are the most important, because everything's coming to a head.
[00:23:07.682 --> 00:23:10.604]  Thank you so much for joining us here today.
[00:23:12.185 --> 00:23:16.408]  Everything I'm about to cover is on the record.
[00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:30.539]  And the social engineers that want to sleepwalk us into full nuclear war for whatever psychotic reason, we know why, I'll lay it out, don't want there to be a debate about going to war.
[00:23:30.579 --> 00:23:31.860]  They don't want a declaration of war.
[00:23:33.141 --> 00:23:39.086]  They know in major polls, between 70 and 80% of Americans are against this war in Ukraine.
[00:23:40.677 --> 00:23:44.700]  You don't have to like Putin or hate Putin to not want nuclear war.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.643]  You just need to have a survival instinct and common sense.
[00:23:50.024 --> 00:23:55.167]  So there are hundreds of points that go into this, but I normally have Jack Posobiec on like once a month.
[00:23:56.448 --> 00:24:00.932]  But I've been having Jack on because he's former Naval Intelligence, a really good journalist, a really dialed in guy.
[00:24:01.292 --> 00:24:02.193]  He knows what he's talking about.
[00:24:02.233 --> 00:24:03.514]  He's got a lot of history.
[00:24:03.894 --> 00:24:05.915]  So do I. That's why I know he knows what he's talking about.
[00:24:07.917 --> 00:24:19.017]   And he's been saying Germany first, and then if Poland had an election the way he predicted it would, and they have, that Poland next would announce military mobilization against Russia.
[00:24:20.218 --> 00:24:38.640]   Then Biden said two weeks ago, and it's on record, that if you don't give us the 106 billion dollars, which they didn't get, because the Republicans wanted border security as a trade-off, Biden said hell no, Your sons and daughters will be dying within a few months in Ukraine.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.083]  Then the Secretary of Defense, a week and a half ago, went and told Congress that.
[00:24:42.563 --> 00:24:47.287]  Then over the weekend, blink, and they have the State Department said the same thing.
[00:24:47.667 --> 00:24:49.829]  And a bunch of congressmen and women and senators.
[00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.712]  Then yesterday, it got almost no attention.
[00:24:54.253 --> 00:24:58.796]  When I first saw this on Twitter, or X now, I went and checked it and confirmed it.
[00:24:58.836 --> 00:24:59.817]  I've got the articles right here.
[00:25:01.799 --> 00:25:25.127]   They're bypassing The countries in the EU that don't want to have a member join, that being Ukraine, and the EU is flexing its dictatorial muscles, you have to know the whole history of the EU to understand it was a steel deal in 1947, and that's how it set up this unelected council.
[00:25:26.007 --> 00:25:32.632]  Then later when the EU officially got set up in the mid-90s, they created a ceremonial parliament.
[00:25:34.093 --> 00:25:49.709]  But it is only advisory to the unelected bureaucracy or the EU dictatorship, which is actually a plan of Hitler, but they, after Hitler was defeated, still took it off the shelf and now set it up.
[00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:56.016]  So there's so many facets to this, but here's probably the best way to describe this.
[00:25:57.045 --> 00:26:04.547]  And I'm extremely upset, because I like living and I love my children and I love your children, because our children are going to live together in this world, if there is a world.
[00:26:06.387 --> 00:26:14.669]  Jack Posobiec has been predicting all this with great precision, so have I, so has Ron Paul, so has Tucker Carlson, so has Steve Bannon, because we do our homework.
[00:26:15.069 --> 00:26:16.949]  You've heard us every day, warning of this.
[00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:23.731]  Whenever big news was out there, I'd say, yeah, we're going to cover this news, but first, here's your World War III nuclear war alert, okay?
[00:26:26.178 --> 00:26:37.364]  This is so serious, I had Jack on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and now it's Friday.
[00:26:37.484 --> 00:26:39.725]  You ever seen me have Jack on four or five days in a row?
[00:26:39.745 --> 00:26:41.706]  He's on today in an hour, or less than an hour.
[00:26:45.128 --> 00:26:50.791]  And he said, listen to what Biden says, listen to what the Secretary of Defense says, listen to them.
[00:26:51.636 --> 00:26:55.777]  They're saying Russia is about to attack a NATO country.
[00:26:55.797 --> 00:27:04.779]  And everybody goes, well, that's crazy that Biden said that, or Blinken said that, or Lloyd Austin said that, because Russia isn't saying they're going to do that.
[00:27:04.819 --> 00:27:07.540]  They have no reason to do that, and that would trigger a nuclear war.
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.180]  Ukraine's not a NATO member.
[00:27:12.201 --> 00:27:32.810]   And then yesterday they say the EU Unelected Bureaucracy, the EU Commission, not the Parliament that is elected, but the ceremonial advisory at best, said we're bypassing Hungary and other countries that are saying they veto it even though that's in the EU Parliamentary Law.
[00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.030]  They don't care.
[00:27:34.511 --> 00:27:48.862]  The EU is bypassing it and saying we're overriding it and we're going to go ahead and move to admit Ukraine, Moldovia and Georgia.
[00:27:50.684 --> 00:28:00.247]   Now Russia has said Ukraine or Georgia or Moldovia are red lines.
[00:28:00.327 --> 00:28:09.629]  And I sent you guys a graphic that shows the advance since World War II of NATO up to Russia's borders and accelerating after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.
[00:28:09.749 --> 00:28:14.030]  And so we can put that on screen and go through that in a moment.
[00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:21.491]  But I guess the best way to boil this down, because I love to give you all the data points in the background, is this.
[00:28:23.066 --> 00:28:36.573]  Putin has said it's a red line, and said he knew they were secretly trying to get Ukraine into NATO, and that that's where Russia was founded a thousand years ago, and it's right on their border, and they're not going to put up with it, and that they would invade if that happened.
[00:28:37.013 --> 00:28:50.440]  And then there was a proxy war, and the overthrow of the Ukrainian government nine years ago, and several other coups, and then NATO forces through proxies pushing the Russians out, even though that was their land in the east.
[00:28:52.645 --> 00:29:00.190]  And then we've had all the denials of Biden and everybody else that, oh, no, no, no, we're not going to make them a NATO member.
[00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:01.051]  That's not going to happen.
[00:29:02.371 --> 00:29:10.016]  And then now they come out yesterday, the EU Commission, and says, yeah, we're going to go ahead and just bring them into NATO any day now.
[00:29:12.018 --> 00:29:16.821]  That is 100% the way World War I and World War II started.
[00:29:18.482 --> 00:29:21.404]  Different power blocks grabbing land from other power blocks.
[00:29:22.441 --> 00:29:23.842]  And so it is an act of war.
[00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:26.444]  It is super dangerous.
[00:29:27.464 --> 00:29:28.265]  It is insane.
[00:29:28.285 --> 00:29:42.894]  So we've got all this other amazing AI news and open border news and an FBI chief convicted of being a Russian agent who created the fake dossier on Trump.
[00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:53.087]  And we've got Fox News reporting on the insurance company actuaries that show the record deaths linked to the vaccines.
[00:29:53.407 --> 00:29:54.488]  I mean, it's a big day.
[00:29:54.588 --> 00:29:55.669]  It's a big news day.
[00:29:58.211 --> 00:30:12.903]  But, NATO doing this is so dangerous, so reckless, so crazy, that it makes my head spin.
[00:30:14.167 --> 00:30:23.333]  In fact, I'm so upset by this, because I know what it really means, that I'm having serious trouble doing the broadcast right now.
[00:30:24.814 --> 00:30:42.806]  And that's a normal response when your government is hijacked and at war with you, and then it's at war with all these other countries, and it's moving weapons up to the Russian border, and we've got troops there for years fighting the Russians, and now Biden basically admits it's happening, and says we're going to full war, but wait, we'll skip this break.
[00:30:45.069 --> 00:30:47.070]  It gets worse, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:48.231 --> 00:30:49.312]  Yeah, keep rolling through that graphic.
[00:30:49.332 --> 00:30:51.253]  I want TV viewers to see this.
[00:30:53.495 --> 00:31:02.621]  Jack Posobiec comes on two days ago, and we do a 30-minute interview, and it gets a couple million views.
[00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:06.424]  Let's put the tweet up in a moment from real Alex Jones.
[00:31:09.406 --> 00:31:12.248]  And it gets, again, a couple million views.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.701]  And they put a community note on it.
[00:31:15.721 --> 00:31:16.621]  Now look at that, breaking.
[00:31:17.262 --> 00:31:20.083]  NATO officially mobilizes for direct war with Russia.
[00:31:21.003 --> 00:31:30.147]  Now, it's NATO as the source, and they go on to say, no, NATO is not mobilized.
[00:31:30.787 --> 00:31:36.229]  Ladies and gentlemen, NATO was created officially, I'll show you the founding documents, the expansion of NATO in 77.
[00:31:36.068 --> 00:31:45.469]   until in 77, it was created as a "mobilization against the Soviet Union."
[00:31:45.463 --> 00:31:48.743]  It is a European military mobilization.
[00:31:50.424 --> 00:31:57.145]  This is like saying Tom Landry has nothing to do with the Dallas Cowboys.
[00:31:59.146 --> 00:32:03.847]  Tom Landry was the founder of the Dallas Cowboys, their founding coach.
[00:32:04.947 --> 00:32:12.289]  It's like saying Michael Jordan has nothing to do with professional basketball.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:24.444]  It's like saying George Washington has nothing to do with America, or Jesus has nothing to do with Christianity, or Coca-Cola has nothing to do with Coca-Cola.
[00:32:25.745 --> 00:32:27.106]  I'm going to show you these documents.
[00:32:27.846 --> 00:32:36.670]  And look, it's not that I'm upset that NATO, as the source, went and posted as a community note that they're not mobilizing for direct war with Russia.
[00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:42.473]  These are quotes from NATO I'm going to show you.
[00:32:44.977 --> 00:32:46.678]  So it's not about us getting fact-checked.
[00:32:47.579 --> 00:32:55.623]  It's about the whole psychology of us rushing into war, rushing into escalation on the Rand Corporation threat ladder.
[00:32:55.723 --> 00:32:56.644]  We'll pull that up in a moment.
[00:32:57.124 --> 00:33:03.288]  I just type in the Rand Corporation threat ladder.
[00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:10.127]   And when you get up into The last few numbers, you're in full nuclear war.
[00:33:10.207 --> 00:33:11.088]  That's in the low 40s.
[00:33:11.408 --> 00:33:19.353]  We're in the high 30s right now on a major war game that they still say is the most accurate based on this conflict in Eastern Europe.
[00:33:20.534 --> 00:33:26.398]  And then this conflict that was looked at the 60s, 70s and 80s and 90s has been extrapolated out to the rest of the world.
[00:33:26.418 --> 00:33:29.920]  But this is the original war game and it's dead on what's happening.
[00:33:32.196 --> 00:33:50.442]  They don't want us having a discussion about this because they know if 80% of us don't want this war or to pay for Zelensky's cocaine habit, when he comes here and says, stop crying Americans, you know, you don't get roads, you don't get anything, all money goes to me and my military.
[00:33:52.162 --> 00:33:56.504]  They don't want you to have a discussion about what it means to go to direct war.
[00:33:56.584 --> 00:34:09.164]   But Lloyd Austin, O'Biden, The Secretary of State Blinken have all publicly said, you can pull it up, that U.S.
[00:34:09.204 --> 00:34:18.728]  troops will have to be fighting and dying in the next few months if we don't give them unlimited money.
[00:34:19.348 --> 00:34:22.669]  And then when Russia defeats that, it's still back to the same threat of full war.
[00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:24.370]  That's how escalation works.
[00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:27.351]  So as the Russians win, what does NATO and the West do?
[00:34:27.411 --> 00:34:30.712]  They accelerate on their border with heavy weapons.
[00:34:35.677 --> 00:34:41.222]  Now, I know most people don't study Cold War, nuclear war doctrine and threat escalation tables.
[00:34:41.382 --> 00:34:41.662]  I do.
[00:34:45.545 --> 00:34:46.526]  And so does Jack Posobiec.
[00:34:46.566 --> 00:34:47.927]  He joins us in 45 minutes.
[00:34:48.628 --> 00:34:50.069]  But look at these headlines.
[00:34:50.529 --> 00:35:02.019]  EU leaders bypass Hungary's Orban objections and approve beginning of ascension negotiations with Ukraine for an expedited, accelerated entry of Ukraine, Moldovia, Georgia and other countries.
[00:35:02.259 --> 00:35:06.253]   They're not just saying, hey, We're not just going to take Ukraine.
[00:35:06.635 --> 00:35:09.526]  We're going to take it all and completely surround you.
[00:35:12.008 --> 00:35:14.309]  But don't worry, we got a community note.
[00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:17.551]  Readers added context they thought people might want to know.
[00:35:18.092 --> 00:35:21.114]  NATO is not officially mobilizing for war with Russia.
[00:35:21.534 --> 00:35:23.595]  NATO has increased defensive activity in the region.
[00:35:23.875 --> 00:35:26.297]  Yeah, and shipped all those weapons in since 2018.
[00:35:26.877 --> 00:35:34.482]  Since 2022, NATO has developed a growing presence of 40,000 troops to counter potential threats NATO members and further Russian aggression.
[00:35:35.543 --> 00:35:41.738]   Now here's Air Force Times, as our source saying you're wrong.
[00:35:42.658 --> 00:35:42.959]  U.S.
[00:35:42.999 --> 00:35:47.860]  NATO Air Forces mobilize as war comes to Europe.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.161]  Mobilize for war.
[00:35:50.861 --> 00:35:52.722]  Mobilize for war.
[00:35:53.562 --> 00:35:54.842]  What is the headline we put?
[00:35:55.723 --> 00:35:58.003]  Mobilize for war with Russia.
[00:35:59.064 --> 00:36:00.144]  But we're liars, right?
[00:36:00.564 --> 00:36:02.945]  That's Air Force Times.
[00:36:04.906 --> 00:36:05.926]  Here's Miami Herald.
[00:36:06.974 --> 00:36:08.655]  There's no negotiating with Putin.
[00:36:08.996 --> 00:36:10.497]  NATO must mobilize.
[00:36:10.557 --> 00:36:11.097]  And they have.
[00:36:11.357 --> 00:36:12.858]  Military might be ready to fight.
[00:36:13.499 --> 00:36:14.680]  That's mobilize to fight.
[00:36:15.721 --> 00:36:16.181]  Newsweek.
[00:36:16.241 --> 00:36:19.223]  NATO in race against time to prepare for war with Russia.
[00:36:19.563 --> 00:36:20.664]  Mobilization.
[00:36:24.968 --> 00:36:26.269]  European mobilization.
[00:36:26.409 --> 00:36:27.990]  US and NATO reserves.
[00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:29.291]  That's from the 70s.
[00:36:29.891 --> 00:36:32.433]  They say in here, NATO is a mobilization.
[00:36:32.513 --> 00:36:34.912]  It is a mobilization for war.
[00:36:34.912 --> 00:36:48.153]   So, let's just hope NATO is using this to launder a bunch of
[00:36:48.153 --> 00:36:53.543]   money and increase their troop level up to 300,000, which they've
[00:36:53.543 --> 00:36:54.673]  just announced.
[00:36:54.912 --> 00:36:55.953]  Here's that article right here.
[00:36:57.214 --> 00:36:57.934]  Head of NATO.
[00:36:59.175 --> 00:37:00.455]  NATO's 300,000 high alert troops.
[00:37:03.297 --> 00:37:04.077]  Now imagine that.
[00:37:04.137 --> 00:37:04.697]  I'm a U.S.
[00:37:04.737 --> 00:37:05.118]  citizen.
[00:37:05.158 --> 00:37:05.818]  I'm a father.
[00:37:06.638 --> 00:37:07.379]  I'm a taxpayer.
[00:37:08.547 --> 00:37:14.088]  And I see the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the President of the United States saying U.S.
[00:37:14.128 --> 00:37:17.309]  troops will be dying, your sons and daughters, if you don't give us more money.
[00:37:17.809 --> 00:37:20.590]  I see Germany saying they're going to a civil emergency, their Chancellor.
[00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:22.390]  Poland announces it yesterday.
[00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:29.071]  Lloyd Austin, I never got the article guys, type it in, I asked for it, I know we've been busy here.
[00:37:29.832 --> 00:37:34.192]  Last week, headline, Lloyd Austin announces tripling of U.S.
[00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:36.273]  munitions production for Ukraine.
[00:37:37.796 --> 00:37:41.458]  Lloyd Austin announces a tripling of U.S.
[00:37:41.858 --> 00:37:44.100]  munitions production to fight Russia.
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:44.660]  Put it in!
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:45.340]  Show them!
[00:37:45.761 --> 00:37:54.125]  Now, if tripling munitions isn't mobilization, then I don't know what is.
[00:37:54.145 --> 00:37:54.806]  Here, I'll pull it up.
[00:37:59.748 --> 00:38:07.702]   So, you know, that's just where we are here, folks, and people are in such absolute Denial.
[00:38:10.284 --> 00:38:18.788]  Pentagon announces increase in munitions.
[00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:20.289]  There it is.
[00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:20.789]  Tripling.
[00:38:25.672 --> 00:38:25.912]  So.
[00:38:27.653 --> 00:38:28.714]  That's a good headline on the New York Times.
[00:38:28.754 --> 00:38:29.874]  I want the exact headline.
[00:38:30.695 --> 00:38:33.196]  Secretary of Defense announces tripling in munitions production for Ukraine.
[00:38:37.199 --> 00:38:44.201]  My point is, ladies and gentlemen, is that this is all going on, and this is happening.
[00:38:45.321 --> 00:38:52.763]  And then, I'm a talk show host with a former Naval Intelligence guy who's proven he's really smart, has a lot of great connections, get on on what he's breaking down.
[00:38:53.383 --> 00:38:58.184]  We're up here warning you that this is a full mobilization for war with Russia.
[00:39:01.144 --> 00:39:06.025]  And the response of the left and the controllers and all of them is to go do a community notes.
[00:39:06.305 --> 00:39:08.226]  It's not about Jack Posobiec and Alex Jones.
[00:39:08.506 --> 00:39:09.906]  It's about this is across the board.
[00:39:09.926 --> 00:39:13.867]  Remember last year they go, oh we're going to start banning your gas stoves.
[00:39:13.887 --> 00:39:17.328]  It was a federal document with Granholm and the Department of Energy.
[00:39:17.548 --> 00:39:18.849]  They said, oh no we're not, no we're not.
[00:39:18.909 --> 00:39:19.469]  Now they're doing it.
[00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:24.210]  They announced the policy.
[00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:26.511]  We say we don't want to have war with Russia.
[00:39:26.951 --> 00:39:27.911]  We don't want to escalate.
[00:39:28.151 --> 00:39:29.252]  And they go, well you're crazy.
[00:39:29.312 --> 00:39:30.272]  Nobody said we're doing that.
[00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:36.252]  We're just mobilizing and saying where our kids are out to die soon and we're tripling munitions.
[00:39:36.292 --> 00:39:37.312]  I mean, that's not mobilizing.
[00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:45.575]  That's like if I walk up and punch you in the face and you say, why'd you punch me in the face?
[00:39:45.695 --> 00:39:46.736]  I didn't punch you in the face.
[00:39:47.116 --> 00:39:48.597]  You need to go to a lunatic asylum.
[00:39:50.938 --> 00:39:52.398]  Oh, the borders aren't broken.
[00:39:52.438 --> 00:40:02.239]   There's no border problem until two months ago, the White House and the governors in New York and California They wouldn't say the border was broken.
[00:40:02.439 --> 00:40:05.780]  They said it's the best ever and Mayorkas is doing a great job.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.320]  Remember that?
[00:40:08.061 --> 00:40:14.782]  But because it didn't work, and now it's more broken than ever and it's a total disaster, they go, oh, actually it is broken.
[00:40:15.042 --> 00:40:16.003]  It's the Republicans' fault.
[00:40:16.183 --> 00:40:25.125]  I got clips of Biden today and the press secretary both saying, it's a talking point, well, the Republicans are the reason we have a broken border.
[00:40:28.268 --> 00:40:30.270]  But see, we can survive a broken border for a while.
[00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:33.012]  We can't survive nuclear war with Russia, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:33.333 --> 00:40:35.314]  And that's why I am beyond pissed off right now.
[00:40:37.897 --> 00:41:05.202]   And if you think the public's sleepwalking into nuclear war, the establishment, who's mainly a bunch of inbred, pedophilic lawyers, who've not been defeated and have gone around bullying a bunch of third-world sand traps, They really think with all these nuclear submarines off our coast and all of these weapons and all of this that the Pentagon says, oh, we can survive a nuclear war with Russia.
[00:41:06.043 --> 00:41:09.006]  I mean, sure, it might kill 50 million people in America, but we'll win.
[00:41:11.328 --> 00:41:20.656]  You've already seen the disasters they've created, all the crime, the devaluation of the currency, all the curses that are upon this country and Europe.
[00:41:21.937 --> 00:41:22.977]  Let's be forsaken God.
[00:41:23.097 --> 00:41:27.018]  And now these lunatics are saying, well, your kids might be dying in a few months there.
[00:41:27.038 --> 00:41:28.439]  We're going to go to war with Russia.
[00:41:28.979 --> 00:41:31.920]  If you don't give us, you know, unlimited money and more heavy weapons.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:45.724]  And just a year ago, Biden said in December of last year, we can't give F-16s and Abrams tanks.
[00:41:46.906 --> 00:41:53.491]  To the Ukrainians, because in the threat escalation models and agreements and rules, that means an escalation into World War III.
[00:41:55.593 --> 00:41:57.274]  There it is, Army to triple munitions production.
[00:41:58.335 --> 00:41:59.275]  Good job, crew, finding that.
[00:41:59.295 --> 00:42:05.040]  I just want new viewers and listeners, we have a million shooting in a day right now, millions, who never watched the show.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:17.611]   Now we're back on X. Because we were never that big on Twitter before, but after the censorship and all the suppression, people are really hungry now, and The show is just exploding.
[00:42:18.993 --> 00:42:20.574]  The broadcast is exploding right now.
[00:42:21.295 --> 00:42:28.142]  And I have a real responsibility here, this critical time, I think this is God's doing, to try to stop this.
[00:42:28.162 --> 00:42:29.203]  And we should call Congress.
[00:42:29.863 --> 00:42:30.804]  We should peacefully march.
[00:42:31.285 --> 00:42:33.347]  We should go to our churches and demand they speak out against it.
[00:42:37.171 --> 00:42:57.580]  And we should do everything we can to have a national debate about how we're being told, okay, we're gearing up for full direct war with Russia, but we can't do that because the censors and the controllers are going in and putting community notes and trying to block the distribution of us simply showing you what they said.
[00:43:00.641 --> 00:43:03.803]  Everything Jack Posobiec said in that interview, they're trying to suppress it.
[00:43:03.863 --> 00:43:04.683]  Everything I said.
[00:43:06.104 --> 00:43:06.944]  Was on record.
[00:43:06.964 --> 00:43:08.065]  Do you want me to play you?
[00:43:09.045 --> 00:43:13.327]  Biden saying our sons and daughters will soon be dying over there in a direct war with Russia.
[00:43:14.307 --> 00:43:14.968]  You want me to play it?
[00:43:15.708 --> 00:43:16.548]  Blinken saying it.
[00:43:16.628 --> 00:43:17.068]  Do you want me to?
[00:43:17.248 --> 00:43:18.229]  Because they all said it.
[00:43:18.249 --> 00:43:20.550]  I already played the clips many times.
[00:43:22.291 --> 00:43:24.631]  Or do you want to just believe the community notes saying it's not true?
[00:43:26.252 --> 00:43:28.293]  But let me just back up here for a minute again.
[00:43:30.474 --> 00:43:33.055]  Do you understand the main takeaway here?
[00:43:34.115 --> 00:43:35.656]  Do you understand the main takeaway?
[00:43:37.233 --> 00:43:39.734]  Nobody's ever going to have Ukraine and NATO.
[00:43:39.814 --> 00:43:40.734]  That's ridiculous.
[00:43:40.794 --> 00:43:41.634]  Putin's a liar.
[00:43:41.734 --> 00:43:42.594]  He's crazy.
[00:43:43.094 --> 00:43:43.715]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:43:43.795 --> 00:43:51.056]  And now NATO and the EU announce, oh, we're bypassing the parliament and we're bypassing the veto power of Hungary and other countries.
[00:43:51.557 --> 00:43:53.837]  We're going to go ahead and take that over and make it NATO.
[00:43:54.277 --> 00:43:56.158]  Oh, and we're going to do it in a bunch of other countries too.
[00:43:56.698 --> 00:43:57.518]  And here's a list of them.
[00:43:57.898 --> 00:43:59.639]  Moldovia, Georgia, and a couple others.
[00:44:00.699 --> 00:44:01.679]  All total five.
[00:44:03.339 --> 00:44:05.060]  And it's barely even in the news.
[00:44:07.264 --> 00:44:20.168]   We're gonna move our troops and weapons all around Russia, not just in a few spots, while George Soros goes on CNN back when he could still talk and says, I will be the czar of Russia.
[00:44:20.208 --> 00:44:21.228]  We have encircled them.
[00:44:21.548 --> 00:44:22.869]  We will soon overthrow them.
[00:44:23.209 --> 00:44:24.969]  And that's meant to mess with Putin.
[00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:26.470]  So he'd respond back.
[00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:32.592]  They're poking the bear over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:44:32.932 --> 00:44:35.253]  And then we're like, hey, that's a bad idea.
[00:44:35.433 --> 00:44:36.374]  Oh, shut up, Jones.
[00:44:36.594 --> 00:44:37.334]  Nobody's doing that.
[00:44:38.663 --> 00:44:39.583]  That's psychology.
[00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:41.264]  I think we're going to stop this.
[00:44:41.304 --> 00:44:42.465]  I think cooler heads are going to prevail.
[00:44:42.505 --> 00:44:43.926]  We've been to the edge of nuclear war before.
[00:44:43.946 --> 00:44:51.709]  I'm not saying we're going to have nuclear war, but they know if there's a debate about this, that America is going to get sick of this and cut the funding off and stop it.
[00:44:51.909 --> 00:44:56.852]  So now they're holding us hostage saying, well, we've got to go to full war with Russia if you don't give us the money.
[00:44:57.692 --> 00:45:00.853]  As they move to do things that will bring Russia in even stronger.
[00:45:01.593 --> 00:45:02.554]  That's the takeaway.
[00:45:02.934 --> 00:45:03.674]  That's the facts.
[00:45:03.694 --> 00:45:07.055]  I'm going to hit other news for the first 30 minutes of the next hour, because there's a lot of it.
[00:45:07.335 --> 00:45:09.416]  When Jack Posobiec comes on, we'll respond.
[00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:11.057]  But this is disgusting, okay?
[00:45:12.377 --> 00:45:15.378]  NATO was created as a mobilization against Russia.
[00:45:15.818 --> 00:45:17.759]  In its founding documents, I just showed it to you.
[00:45:18.099 --> 00:45:25.442]  I showed you mainstream military publications and mainstream news saying we're in a mobilization against Russia.
[00:45:26.351 --> 00:45:27.632]  We need full mobilization.
[00:45:29.034 --> 00:45:33.038]  Zelensky's over here saying the mobilization's not big enough on Fox News.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.621]  And we're like, we don't want that mobilization.
[00:45:37.022 --> 00:45:37.883]  There is no mobilization.
[00:45:38.804 --> 00:45:39.905]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[00:45:39.925 --> 00:45:40.385]  Move along.
[00:45:41.807 --> 00:45:43.388]  A lot of other stuff loaded for bear.
[00:45:46.203 --> 00:45:53.886]  Depending on where you live in the United States, you want to get your deliveries and do your Christmas shopping at InfoWarship.com and keep us on air and get great products at the same time.
[00:45:54.186 --> 00:45:56.086]  Here's a map of the United States from the USPS.
[00:45:57.287 --> 00:46:00.768]  And if you look at it, here's our main shipping operation out of Denver.
[00:46:01.708 --> 00:46:05.129]  And you see here, one day is a lot of the country.
[00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:07.550]  Two days is most of the country.
[00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:09.791]  And three days is almost all of it.
[00:46:10.611 --> 00:46:19.523]   And I think it's like four days to Alaska or Hawaii. So you want to get your orders in by
[00:46:19.523 --> 00:46:25.474]   Monday folks to make sure you get it way before Christmas Coming up Monday after next and we have storewide free

[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.261]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:46:49.563 --> 00:46:53.563]   *cough* people that are boys
[00:46:53.563 --> 00:46:55.563]   and i don't know what that is, never seen one of those before
[00:46:55.563 --> 00:46:59.563]   people whose gender might be a little bit of both or might even be neither
[00:46:59.563 --> 00:47:03.563]   some public schools and libraries invite drag queens
[00:47:03.563 --> 00:47:07.563]   some dress like torn demons to read to young children
[00:47:07.563 --> 00:47:11.563]   parents rights are limited and children's rights are put ahead
[00:47:11.563 --> 00:47:15.563]   so the child has the right to be protected from the parents
[00:47:15.563 --> 00:47:19.563]   when the parents behave badly yeah that child molester
[00:47:19.563 --> 00:47:23.563]   just messed with the wrong preschooler *cough*
[00:47:23.563 --> 00:47:25.563]  what makes you think he's a child molester?
[00:47:25.563 --> 00:47:29.563]   oh he's a child molester believe me
[00:47:29.563 --> 00:47:33.563]   every child molester i've ever met looks just like that
[00:47:33.563 --> 00:47:37.563]   and make gay little babies for the whole human race make a world we can live in
[00:47:37.563 --> 00:47:41.642]   we're the one who you love's not an issue ♪ Love's not an issue ♪
[00:47:41.471 --> 00:47:41.872]  What?
[00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:48.692]   convert your children. What? Happens bit by bit, quietly and subtly, and you will barely
[00:47:48.692 --> 00:47:57.492]   notice it. You can keep him from disco, warn about San Francisco, make him wear faded pants
[00:47:57.492 --> 00:48:03.972]   we don't care. And then you have talk show stars like Joe Rogan who just wing it, who
[00:48:03.972 --> 00:48:05.570]  make it up as they go along.
[00:48:05.832 --> 00:48:15.615]  And because figures like Rogan are trusted by people that don't trust real newsrooms, we have a tension, a problem that's much bigger than Spotify, much bigger than any single platform, Kate.
[00:48:15.695 --> 00:48:20.496]  But that's what's at the heart of this ri- Dammit, everything on TV sucks.
[00:48:21.057 --> 00:48:23.057]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:48:23.057 --> 00:48:24.057]  Cool.
[00:48:24.057 --> 00:48:28.057]  [Screaming]
[00:48:28.057 --> 00:48:30.057]  Coming for you!
[00:48:30.057 --> 00:48:31.057]  Coming for you!
[00:48:31.057 --> 00:48:32.057]  Cool.
[00:48:32.199 --> 00:48:33.641]  We're gonna beat your ass!
[00:48:33.461 --> 00:48:34.461]  Fire! Fire!
[00:48:34.461 --> 00:48:37.461]  Enforce the law!
[00:48:37.461 --> 00:48:53.461]  Hello?
[00:48:53.944 --> 00:48:54.684]  You piece of shit!
[00:48:55.305 --> 00:48:56.826]  You fucking fucking damn fucker!
[00:48:57.246 --> 00:48:58.167]  Listen, fuckhead!
[00:48:58.588 --> 00:49:00.009]  You fucking crossed the line!
[00:49:00.669 --> 00:49:03.251]  Get that through your fucking damn fucking head!
[00:49:03.332 --> 00:49:05.573]  Stop pushing your shit!
[00:49:05.894 --> 00:49:09.437]  We're gonna beat your ass!
[00:49:09.717 --> 00:49:12.199]  You just get that through your stinking traitorous heads!
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:17.203]  But I will stomp your head in if you start a fight with me, you thug scum!
[00:49:17.503 --> 00:49:18.985]  You think I'm a coward like you?! !
[00:49:21.011 --> 00:49:28.035]  Uh... I... We're... Uh... Whoa!
[00:49:28.755 --> 00:49:31.477]  I just got invited to give the commencement address at Harvard this year.
[00:49:31.677 --> 00:49:32.638]  That's amazing!
[00:49:33.178 --> 00:49:34.377]  I'm gay!
[00:49:34.377 --> 00:49:39.378]   *gagging* Oh yeah, bro!

[00:49:43.378 --> 00:49:47.378]   *gagging* *gagging*
[00:49:47.378 --> 00:49:48.378]  Let's go get that!
[00:49:48.628 --> 00:49:53.168]  Alright. So you get to wear the hat and everything? Nice!
[00:49:53.168 --> 00:49:55.628]  You better! Don't worry. Hello?
[00:49:55.628 --> 00:50:01.628]   *Squeal* I see you enemy!
[00:50:01.284 --> 00:50:02.465]  I see you, enemy!
[00:50:03.005 --> 00:50:03.466]  Enemy!
[00:50:04.026 --> 00:50:04.486]  Enemy!
[00:50:04.766 --> 00:50:06.107]  You are my enemy!
[00:50:06.688 --> 00:50:07.508]  You will pay.
[00:50:07.528 --> 00:50:09.430]  Yeah, you think I don't see your face, scum?
[00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:10.831]  You don't think I don't see you?
[00:50:11.271 --> 00:50:11.691]  I see you.
[00:50:11.751 --> 00:50:13.112]  You understand me?
[00:50:13.233 --> 00:50:15.274]  I know what you think of me and my family.
[00:50:15.474 --> 00:50:16.035]  I see you.
[00:50:16.275 --> 00:50:16.695]  Right back.
[00:50:16.875 --> 00:50:18.096]  You understand that?
[00:50:17.916 --> 00:50:19.916]  Damn it!
[00:50:19.916 --> 00:50:26.916]  You will fall!
[00:50:27.222 --> 00:50:29.244]  You will not bring humanity down!
[00:50:29.605 --> 00:50:32.963]  God is going to destroy you!
[00:50:32.963 --> 00:50:34.965]  (Screaming)
[00:50:34.965 --> 00:51:01.284]  (Rap music)
[00:51:01.284 --> 00:51:29.284]  (Screaming)
[00:51:29.284 --> 00:51:33.284]   Well, I thought with all the nuclear war news, we'd have some fun.
[00:51:33.276 --> 00:51:35.537]  So, we just did that for the last five minutes.
[00:51:35.577 --> 00:51:41.859]  Now I'm going to get real serious, cover all the other news, and we'll get back into NATO, moving for direct nuclear war with Russia.
[00:51:42.259 --> 00:51:43.219]  You can't make this up.
[00:51:43.259 --> 00:51:44.380]  You can't overhype this.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.260]  This is insanity.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.061]  Our government are basically Hitler.
[00:51:48.181 --> 00:52:00.983]   All right, we're now into hour number two, and I spent most of the hour on the EU saying, we don't care What the EU Parliament says or what the law says.
[00:52:01.003 --> 00:52:07.746]  We're going to go ahead and just have Ukraine enter NATO along with Georgia, Moldova, and a couple other countries.
[00:52:07.827 --> 00:52:09.447]  Total act of war with Russia.
[00:52:10.188 --> 00:52:11.488]  Absolutely no doubt about it.
[00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:14.470]  This is how giant wars have started, but now we've got nuclear weapons.
[00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:16.051]  This is insane.
[00:52:16.971 --> 00:52:22.974]  NATO crosses Putin's red line, accelerates plan for Ukraine to enter NATO, as both sides mobilize for total war.
[00:52:23.795 --> 00:52:27.757]  Now again, we got hit with the community notes on Twitter, on X.
[00:52:29.076 --> 00:52:34.040]  The source was NATO, and NATO says we're not mobilizing.
[00:52:34.801 --> 00:52:45.770]  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the mobilization, ladies and gentlemen, for war with Russia.
[00:52:46.451 --> 00:52:58.868]   And I showed you a bunch of news articles and documents From the Air Force Times, Miami Herald, NATO, Lloyd Austin, all of it.
[00:52:58.888 --> 00:53:05.177]  Secretary of Defense saying that we are mobilizing for total war.
[00:53:05.197 --> 00:53:21.097]   And you've seen Biden and Secretary of State and all of them say, That if we don't give unlimited money to Zelensky and don't back him up, and if Zelensky fails and the Ukrainians being conscripted and the meat grinder fail, we are going to send in U.S.
[00:53:21.177 --> 00:53:25.499]  and NATO troops to fight Russia because, quote, he's going to attack a NATO country.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.740]  We're like, but it's not a NATO country.
[00:53:28.761 --> 00:53:30.481]  They're about to make it a NATO country.
[00:53:30.921 --> 00:53:39.185]  So, simply put, they're about to make Ukraine a NATO country, which is what Putin warned them to begin with because they were doing it by proxy and everything with name only.
[00:53:41.215 --> 00:53:43.037]  And so now they can just say, oh, it's NATO now.
[00:53:43.337 --> 00:53:44.178]  You've got troops there.
[00:53:44.198 --> 00:53:45.139]  Now you're at war with NATO.
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:50.483]  I tend to always walk through the history in the background and then get to the answer at the end.
[00:53:50.503 --> 00:53:52.205]  Most of you already know that.
[00:53:52.225 --> 00:53:53.005]  You don't need me to tell you.
[00:53:53.025 --> 00:53:53.726]  This is crazy.
[00:53:54.447 --> 00:53:55.388]  So there's the bottom line.
[00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:03.775]  NATO and the EU, outside of the law, outside of the parliaments, are saying the veto no longer counts.
[00:54:04.556 --> 00:54:07.859]  By Hungary and a few other countries, we're just going to go ahead and bring them into NATO.
[00:54:08.948 --> 00:54:11.869]  And the minute they're brought into NATO, we're at war with Russia.
[00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.689]  Officially.
[00:54:14.889 --> 00:54:16.850]  And Biden says, yeah, get ready for your sons and daughters to die.
[00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:21.851]  And so does the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and a bunch of Senators and House members in the last two weeks.
[00:54:22.531 --> 00:54:29.333]  I've played all the clips, I've covered it over and over again, and I told you this is crazy, and it's psychotic, and now it's here.
[00:54:29.533 --> 00:54:31.654]  In fact, I can barely even cover the other news.
[00:54:31.734 --> 00:54:32.794]  I'm being honest with you right now.
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:36.820]  People say, oh, the stress is getting to me.
[00:54:37.101 --> 00:54:38.961]  Yeah, the stress should be getting to you, folks.
[00:54:39.341 --> 00:54:40.462]  This isn't normal.
[00:54:40.782 --> 00:54:41.882]  This is insane!
[00:54:43.663 --> 00:54:45.784]  You think Kennedy was happy during the Cuban Missile Crisis?
[00:54:48.725 --> 00:54:49.525]  And why did that happen?
[00:54:49.365 --> 00:54:55.365]   The United States put medium-range nuclear missiles in Turkey and the Russians found
[00:54:55.365 --> 00:55:05.645]  out about it, so they put nuclear missiles in Cuba.
[00:55:05.487 --> 00:55:20.859]   put missiles 90 miles from Russia next killing me now And so they put their missiles in Cuba and you know what happened?
[00:55:20.879 --> 00:55:22.020]  We almost went to nuclear war with them.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:27.644]  It was a blockade around Cuba and it came seconds from full nuclear war with U.S.
[00:55:27.664 --> 00:55:29.586]  ships firing warning shots at the Russians.
[00:55:30.646 --> 00:55:33.815]  And then Kennedy got on the phone with Khrushchev and they de-escalated it.
[00:55:34.136 --> 00:55:35.660]  And we agreed to pull the missiles out of Europe.
[00:55:36.422 --> 00:55:37.906]  And they agreed to pull their missiles out of Cuba.
[00:55:38.928 --> 00:55:47.593]  And now we fast forward to something way more dangerous than the Cuban Missile Crisis, and we simply try to go on the air and say, look, NATO says they're mobilizing.
[00:55:47.833 --> 00:55:48.554]  They say U.S.
[00:55:48.574 --> 00:55:50.475]  troops and NATO troops are about to be fighting Russians.
[00:55:50.715 --> 00:55:52.056]  We know it's already going on covertly.
[00:55:52.376 --> 00:55:54.077]  This is a terrible mobilization.
[00:55:54.297 --> 00:55:55.678]  They're calling it a mobilization.
[00:55:55.958 --> 00:56:01.282]  And NATO fact checks us and says, no, we're not mobilizing against Russia.
[00:56:01.302 --> 00:56:08.302]   And I just showed you a whole bunch of articles, mainstream news with them saying we are mobilizing.
[00:56:08.302 --> 00:56:16.820]  All right, let's talk about the other news.
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:26.820]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:56:18.697 --> 00:56:26.041]  I mean, you think dissolved borders and fentanyl and devalued currencies and drag queen story time and satanic temple altars of the state houses are bad.
[00:56:28.362 --> 00:56:31.224]  Critical race theory teaching that little white kids are bad.
[00:56:31.244 --> 00:56:35.106]  And now we have the IBM head literally saying we're not hiring any more white people.
[00:56:36.166 --> 00:56:46.070]   And now we've got new documents coming out where the feds are going to put AI into all the businesses as the new EEOC monitor, you're going to get fined if you have too many white people working there.
[00:56:46.411 --> 00:56:48.492]  I mean, this is all insane.
[00:56:50.513 --> 00:56:56.397]  And Mike Adams is going to be here in the second and third hour of the deep dive on AI with a lot of breaking, cutting-edge information.
[00:56:57.538 --> 00:56:58.657]  tomorrow's news today.
[00:56:58.657 --> 00:57:11.137]   But you have to understand the globalists released a virus that was serious.
[00:57:11.271 --> 00:57:13.612]  Because it replicates in the body and has a chronic infection.
[00:57:14.373 --> 00:57:18.154]  Then they gave you a shot, supposedly to counter it, that was 10 times worse conservatively.
[00:57:19.075 --> 00:57:26.318]  And now Fox News has doctors and scientists on with insurance company information about record-level deaths from the shots.
[00:57:26.719 --> 00:57:28.400]  You'd think I'd be happy this is coming out.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.720]  I knew this was going to come out.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.721]  They war-gamed it in the Spars 2025-2028 document.
[00:57:35.077 --> 00:57:36.498]  We got a big stack of news on that.
[00:57:37.139 --> 00:57:42.785]  The World Economic Forum has come out and said, soon they're going to get rid of elections and that AI will make all your decisions.
[00:57:42.805 --> 00:57:43.625]  Want to see that clip?
[00:57:43.946 --> 00:57:45.627]  With the head of Google agreeing with him.
[00:57:48.550 --> 00:57:49.611]  Document camera right here, look at this.
[00:57:52.854 --> 00:57:59.461]  I mean, this is all completely and totally out of control.
[00:58:01.425 --> 00:58:09.208]  You're like, yeah, why did Hitler attack North Africa, attack England, attack France, attack Poland, and attack Czechoslovakia?
[00:58:09.228 --> 00:58:11.329]  Because he just was a megalomaniac!
[00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:16.151]  And then you ask, well, why did the Soviet Union attack all these countries?
[00:58:16.171 --> 00:58:17.372]  Because they were megalomaniacs!
[00:58:19.753 --> 00:58:21.653]  And you ask, why is our government doing all this?
[00:58:21.953 --> 00:58:23.974]  Because they're megalomaniacs!
[00:58:25.115 --> 00:58:30.197]  They're on the news literally saying that the main terror threat is white people.
[00:58:31.257 --> 00:58:32.758]  Pulling it directly out of their ass.
[00:58:34.618 --> 00:58:42.441]  They plan to pin us down with a race war at home, full on war with Russia, and then out of this crisis they say they're going to bring in the world government.
[00:58:44.702 --> 00:58:47.663]  Meanwhile, look at these headlines.
[00:58:47.723 --> 00:58:51.924]  And by the way, I left this in there on Owen's broadcast desk.
[00:58:52.004 --> 00:58:53.445]  I shot a special report this morning.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:55.020]  Or Mug Club?
[00:58:55.681 --> 00:58:58.323]  Will you guys go find me the actual study out of England?
[00:58:59.123 --> 00:58:59.944]  It's a big stack.
[00:59:00.044 --> 00:59:01.244]  I don't want to just show the Daily Mail.
[00:59:01.264 --> 00:59:02.285]  I want to show you the study.
[00:59:04.146 --> 00:59:06.908]  Now scientists say breathing is bad for the environment.
[00:59:06.968 --> 00:59:11.111]  Gases we exhale contribute to hurting the earth.
[00:59:11.171 --> 00:59:13.132]  So they say, what do we do?
[00:59:13.352 --> 00:59:14.933]  Well, you have to get rid of people now.
[00:59:16.875 --> 00:59:17.995]  Told you that was the next thing.
[00:59:18.075 --> 00:59:18.676]  Oh, cows!
[00:59:20.157 --> 00:59:20.477]  Put off.
[00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:24.793]  Carbon dioxide and methane.
[00:59:24.833 --> 00:59:25.314]  So do you.
[00:59:25.374 --> 00:59:26.354]  So see, you're bad too.
[00:59:26.414 --> 00:59:28.034]  It's not just the cows, folks.
[00:59:28.594 --> 00:59:32.256]  You're the carbon they want to target.
[00:59:33.576 --> 00:59:40.958]  Ex-FBI intel chief who investigated Trump-Russia collusion gets four years in prison for colluding with Russia.
[00:59:43.799 --> 00:59:44.639]  Gotta love that.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:55.358]   The head FBI agent that ran the Russia operation against Trump Was secretly on the payroll of Putin.
[00:59:58.659 --> 01:00:02.120]  Just got four years in prison, convicted of it.
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.281]  Oh no, the Russians will pay you off, just like the Chinese.
[01:00:06.341 --> 01:00:07.221]  They're definitely doing stuff.
[01:00:07.821 --> 01:00:13.562]  You think Donald Trump, you think the Russians come to Donald Trump and go, we're going to give you a million dollars, sell your country out?
[01:00:14.682 --> 01:00:17.103]  The globalists have put guns in Trump's head to sell America out.
[01:00:17.203 --> 01:00:17.863]  He won't do it.
[01:00:22.304 --> 01:00:24.445]  I'm totally confused by this camera shot, but whatever.
[01:00:24.465 --> 01:00:25.045]  Doesn't matter.
[01:00:25.305 --> 01:00:26.165]  I'm just going to sit right here.
[01:00:26.205 --> 01:00:27.146]  Just center the camera this way.
[01:00:29.086 --> 01:00:39.890]  So... I think I'm too angry at the show at this point.
[01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:42.750]  You know, I really want that study.
[01:00:43.051 --> 01:00:45.051]  I left it in there on the desk.
[01:00:45.051 --> 01:00:52.051]  Are we gonna get it?
[01:00:52.051 --> 01:00:55.051]  I don't know anymore.
[01:00:55.051 --> 01:00:59.051]  You know, people just have had it good too long.
[01:00:59.613 --> 01:01:01.994]  When the nukes start raining, everybody will get what they've been looking for.
[01:01:02.014 --> 01:01:04.495]  And it's perfect.
[01:01:04.536 --> 01:01:06.516]  When we get nuked, we'll have all the satanic temples up.
[01:01:06.536 --> 01:01:07.077]  It'll be perfect.
[01:01:08.797 --> 01:01:09.438]  All right, folks.
[01:01:09.498 --> 01:01:10.638]  We'll come back with Zack Vissovic.
[01:01:10.658 --> 01:01:11.699]  We'll see if I get those articles.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:14.980]  Zack, this is Crystal Palace.
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:15.260]  Inc.
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.821]  NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.
[01:01:16.861 --> 01:01:18.582]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[01:01:19.102 --> 01:01:20.923]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[01:01:22.648 --> 01:01:26.129]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War 3.
[01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:28.510]  Target selection complete.
[01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:30.410]  Time on target sequence complete.
[01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:36.092]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning southbound at Nordkapp.
[01:01:36.372 --> 01:01:37.072]  Bearing 095 degrees.
[01:01:37.232 --> 01:01:43.414]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[01:01:43.474 --> 01:01:49.836]  From the front lines of the Information War... Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[01:01:49.916 --> 01:01:51.277]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[01:01:53.684 --> 01:01:55.987]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[01:01:56.087 --> 01:01:56.588]  You bet!
[01:01:57.068 --> 01:02:01.234]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:02:01.394 --> 01:02:04.358]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[01:02:05.499 --> 01:02:09.524]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[01:02:09.804 --> 01:02:11.747]  Shall we play a game?
[01:02:11.707 --> 01:02:17.707]  How about global thermonuclear war?
[01:02:17.707 --> 01:02:22.707]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:02:22.645 --> 01:02:24.647]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[01:02:24.927 --> 01:02:25.787]  Awaiting launch codes.
[01:02:26.508 --> 01:02:27.709]  We are at a launch mode.
[01:02:28.149 --> 01:02:31.651]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[01:02:32.071 --> 01:02:35.994]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:02:36.454 --> 01:02:36.755]  We're in!
[01:02:37.941 --> 01:02:39.321]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[01:02:39.701 --> 01:02:42.302]  We have Soviet submarine watch detection.
[01:02:42.322 --> 01:02:43.902]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:45.823]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[01:02:46.243 --> 01:02:53.304]  Then again, the only winning move is not today.
[01:02:57.605 --> 01:03:04.327]  We made that promo six years ago about Ukraine leading a nuclear war.
[01:03:06.178 --> 01:03:10.341]  Listen, I wish I didn't know all this stuff, just like he says in the movie War Games, but I do.
[01:03:10.721 --> 01:03:11.482]  And you know it, too.
[01:03:12.723 --> 01:03:17.286]  And the only way to know how this is happening is to understand it's Satan.
[01:03:18.467 --> 01:03:20.108]  Humans are not this evil on average.
[01:03:20.128 --> 01:03:24.791]  There is an evil force driving us all to destroy each other, and it makes me sick.
[01:03:25.171 --> 01:03:26.092]  Alright, the crew found it.
[01:03:26.132 --> 01:03:26.793]  It's not their fault.
[01:03:26.833 --> 01:03:27.433]  It's my fault.
[01:03:27.633 --> 01:03:29.414]  I just wanted to... I get OCD about stuff.
[01:03:29.434 --> 01:03:32.857]  I want to show you everything, because I'm so sick of people saying we're making stuff up.
[01:03:34.036 --> 01:03:48.020]  Then they'll cherry pick one thing I said out of context, like Sandy Hook, and then act like I'm saying things I never even said, and then every interview I go on, they want to bring that up, and then if I say I'm not talking about it, they go, oh, don't you, you refuse to apologize.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.220]  It's a load of crap.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:56.643]  And it's not about me, it's about people obsessing on how the media says who's moral and who's not.
[01:03:56.903 --> 01:03:59.323]  The people running our government are psychotics.
[01:04:00.284 --> 01:04:01.244]  They're the bad people.
[01:04:03.035 --> 01:04:12.460]  And I'm trying to go on talk shows and talk about stopping World War III and controlling our border and saving our currency and bringing energy back and stopping the shutdown of civilization.
[01:04:14.441 --> 01:04:18.743]  And all I hear about is you questioned a mass shooting and said it might have been fake over and over again.
[01:04:19.063 --> 01:04:20.824]  And again, I don't care that I'm being attacked.
[01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:26.304]   I care that people are so stupid they can be led around by the end of their nose with this garbage.
[01:04:26.304 --> 01:04:32.144]  But there is good news.
[01:04:32.294 --> 01:04:38.477]  I mean, they just convicted this chief FBI agent that ran the whole Russiagate thing, and he's a frickin' agent of Putin.
[01:04:41.238 --> 01:04:43.539]  Taking money caught from the Russians.
[01:04:43.559 --> 01:04:46.140]  I mean, think again.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.900]  Do you think I'd take money from the Russians?
[01:04:48.981 --> 01:04:49.161]  No.
[01:04:49.481 --> 01:04:50.621]  Everybody knows I wouldn't do that.
[01:04:51.041 --> 01:04:51.842]  I won't take money from the globals.
[01:04:51.862 --> 01:04:52.602]  They already tried to buy me.
[01:04:52.622 --> 01:04:53.742]  They got more money than the Russians.
[01:04:54.163 --> 01:04:54.743]  I'm not for sale.
[01:04:55.023 --> 01:04:56.223]  Donald Trump is not for sale.
[01:04:56.423 --> 01:04:57.484]  He's gonna make money his way.
[01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:03.318]  And that's why they hate him, because they're ten times worse than the Russians and the Chinese.
[01:05:03.619 --> 01:05:07.500]  The globalists run this country, and Trump doesn't like them selling the country out.
[01:05:07.981 --> 01:05:11.302]  We just think of Russians or Chinese as some group that wants to eat our lunch.
[01:05:11.562 --> 01:05:12.863]  How about BlackRock?
[01:05:13.123 --> 01:05:14.203]  How about Hollywood?
[01:05:14.404 --> 01:05:15.164]  How about the left?
[01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:17.465]  They're the ones that tell you they hate this country!
[01:05:19.966 --> 01:05:27.990]  They're taking down George Washington statues, and Benjamin Franklin statues, and Thomas Jefferson statues now, and putting up Batman statues!
[01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:31.731]  They tell you they hate America.
[01:05:31.771 --> 01:05:33.692]  They tell you how bad America is all day.
[01:05:33.712 --> 01:05:38.955]  And then they sit around and point at people who are trying to save the country and say we're Russian agents.
[01:05:39.096 --> 01:05:41.096]  Horse crap!
[01:05:41.096 --> 01:05:58.096]   Just the generation before me in my family fought the Cold War and fought the Russians in Europe and in Latin America.
[01:05:58.127 --> 01:05:59.148]  You know what my family told me?
[01:06:01.018 --> 01:06:05.740]  They said, yeah, yeah, the Russians have got their own totalitarianism, but our government's even more evil.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.361]  Because they saw it.
[01:06:12.282 --> 01:06:13.742]  And now you can see who's evil.
[01:06:15.503 --> 01:06:17.484]  You can see who's starting World War III right in front of you.
[01:06:20.265 --> 01:06:24.066]  And you can say whatever you want about Trump, he got Supreme Court justices in there to shut down abortion.
[01:06:25.373 --> 01:06:26.593]  And he had, we had peace with Trump.
[01:06:26.873 --> 01:06:30.354]  He messed up big with a shot because he wanted to be a hero and have a solution.
[01:06:30.835 --> 01:06:31.475]  I get all that.
[01:06:32.295 --> 01:06:34.776]  The point is, is they're trying to tell you we can't have Trump.
[01:06:35.036 --> 01:06:41.718]  But the good news is, this particular talk show host gets it right.
[01:06:42.138 --> 01:06:46.199]  I meant to mention this two days ago when it broke, but I was so busy worrying about World War III, I didn't.
[01:06:48.973 --> 01:06:50.857]  So I want to hit this good piece of news right here.
[01:06:51.318 --> 01:06:55.106]  Trump's cases were suspended as the Supreme Court has claimed jurisdiction.
[01:06:55.607 --> 01:06:56.929]  Oh my, how the wind has turned.
[01:06:58.342 --> 01:06:59.242]  I love this commentator.
[01:06:59.262 --> 01:07:04.063]  We're going to play a clip in a minute, but since I ran around commanding it, here it is.
[01:07:04.183 --> 01:07:04.743]  Daily Mail.
[01:07:05.343 --> 01:07:07.064]  Downside to say breathing is bad.
[01:07:07.244 --> 01:07:08.004]  Humans are bad.
[01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:08.744]  Humans exist.
[01:07:09.004 --> 01:07:10.484]  All the animals put off the same thing.
[01:07:10.564 --> 01:07:11.444]  Oh, they're all bad too?
[01:07:11.864 --> 01:07:12.104]  Yep.
[01:07:12.225 --> 01:07:13.405]  Start with the cows and the humans.
[01:07:14.085 --> 01:07:14.865]  Here's the actual study.
[01:07:14.885 --> 01:07:15.505]  British government.
[01:07:16.025 --> 01:07:20.946]  Measurements of methane and nitrous oxide in human breath and the development of UK scale emissions.
[01:07:21.286 --> 01:07:22.566]  It goes on to say humans are bad.
[01:07:23.387 --> 01:07:23.947]  There's the study.
[01:07:23.987 --> 01:07:25.007]  Great job, crew, finding that.
[01:07:25.027 --> 01:07:25.787]  I'm sorry I lost it.
[01:07:27.432 --> 01:07:28.673]  But Jack Massoba is coming up.
[01:07:29.073 --> 01:07:32.754]  Let me go ahead and just do this now, because I think we're going to stop the nuclear war.
[01:07:32.774 --> 01:07:34.875]  We have to keep going on living like we're still going to be here.
[01:07:36.676 --> 01:07:42.299]  Here is a map from the USPS, and here is our main warehouse.
[01:07:42.319 --> 01:07:46.401]  We've got a couple others in Denver, Colorado.
[01:07:47.541 --> 01:07:49.122]  One day, you see where they can deliver.
[01:07:50.262 --> 01:07:51.823]  Two days, most of the country.
[01:07:52.143 --> 01:07:53.684]  Three days, all over CONUS.
[01:07:55.399 --> 01:07:57.883]  Including Hawaii and Alaska.
[01:07:59.625 --> 01:08:07.196]  So, if you get your orders in conservatively by Monday, you'll get it well before Christmas, probably Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.
[01:08:11.314 --> 01:08:11.554]  It's not 100%.
[01:08:11.594 --> 01:08:17.521]  So you should get your orders in this weekend, you should get them in now, and you should experience the products we've got.
[01:08:17.842 --> 01:08:26.692]  If you think our information's hardcore, folks, I go out and find the highest rated, the best companies, the best products, and we soup them up and private label them.
[01:08:27.253 --> 01:08:31.235]  We have the best vitamin D3 for the two types scientists say you need.
[01:08:31.255 --> 01:08:34.356]  80% of it's one, 20% the other, for better absorption.
[01:08:34.757 --> 01:08:35.957]  Everybody needs a clear immune system.
[01:08:36.277 --> 01:08:37.498]  A few drops out of the tongue every day.
[01:08:37.818 --> 01:08:42.861]  Most people can't absorb D3 in the stomach like you should, or the gut, but you can in the blood vessels.
[01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:44.802]  So you take it under the tongue, let it sit there for a minute.
[01:08:46.142 --> 01:08:47.943]  Winter Sun, sold out for a year.
[01:08:48.423 --> 01:08:49.444]  Sold out since last December.

[01:09:16.515 --> 01:09:17.496]  Over a year sold out.
[01:09:17.757 --> 01:09:20.679]  The missing link, the opposite of fluoride, the key.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.261]  Got a limited supply, it's about to sell out.
[01:09:23.321 --> 01:09:23.982]  Still discounted.
[01:09:24.002 --> 01:09:25.803]  Infowarsstore.com.

[01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.891]  It takes money to fight the New World Order.
[01:09:37.532 --> 01:09:41.914]  It takes a lot of capital, so we directly sell high-quality products.
[01:09:41.934 --> 01:09:47.017]  They started taking my sponsors 15 years ago, so we started directly selling to the public, and now it's the model everywhere.
[01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:49.758]  Trailblazing, by necessity.
[01:09:50.939 --> 01:09:52.259]  Necessity's the mother of invention.
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:54.360]  Incredible products.
[01:09:54.721 --> 01:10:00.423]  I haven't mentioned 10% of them at InfoWarsTore.com, and we have the new Team Humanity t-shirts as well.
[01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:04.766]  All right, I want to be very, very clear here today.
[01:10:05.796 --> 01:10:20.163]  With all the millions of people that are tuning in to the broadcast, we're not in the middle of this huge news cycle and all the huge developments happening, and the former FBI chief sentenced to years in prison for being a Russian agent.
[01:10:20.464 --> 01:10:23.725]  He's the guy that quarterbacked the whole fake Russia collusion on Trump.
[01:10:23.785 --> 01:10:24.346]  Isn't that incredible?
[01:10:24.366 --> 01:10:32.210]  I mean, we've got so much huge news, but we're not here taking time out of all this to talk about a Community Notes on X.
[01:10:33.393 --> 01:10:39.657]  Because Jack Posobiec and I got challenged with a NATO filing that we were putting out disinformation.
[01:10:40.998 --> 01:10:42.378]  This is emblematic.
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:52.444]  This is emblematic of how we're being slept walked into nuclear war.
[01:10:56.367 --> 01:11:08.988]   And how they're now saying they're going to bypass even the law and let Not just Ukraine, but Georgia and other countries inner NATO, which is an act of war.
[01:11:11.028 --> 01:11:16.450]  And then when we try to say this is crazy, they come in and suppress us.
[01:11:16.471 --> 01:11:17.571]  They do this across the board.
[01:11:17.951 --> 01:11:34.037]   Oh, you know, we saw Biden and Blinken and Lloyd Austin, Secretary of Defense, all come out the last two weeks and say, if you don't give us $106 billion, your sons and daughters will be dying within months because Who's going to attack a NATO ally or nation?
[01:11:34.058 --> 01:11:35.339]  We're like, well wait, it's not a member.
[01:11:35.759 --> 01:11:41.325]  But see, they're about to make it a member, and then, oh, now, because Russia's already there, now they're at war with Russia.
[01:11:41.746 --> 01:11:46.511]  They are trying to sneak World War III in under our noses.
[01:11:46.791 --> 01:11:47.552]  So look at these headlines.
[01:11:47.692 --> 01:11:49.394]  EU leaders bypass Hungary's Arban.
[01:11:49.734 --> 01:11:50.615]  Objections have been approved.
[01:11:50.655 --> 01:11:51.556]  Beginning of ascension.
[01:11:51.837 --> 01:11:53.759]  Negotiations with Ukraine and other nations.
[01:11:54.943 --> 01:11:56.504]  Here's the community notes against us.
[01:11:56.624 --> 01:11:57.024]  Breaking.
[01:11:57.064 --> 01:11:59.725]  NATO officially mobilizes for direct war with Russia.
[01:12:00.005 --> 01:12:00.686]  Look at the headlines.
[01:12:01.246 --> 01:12:02.246]  Air Force Times.
[01:12:02.767 --> 01:12:05.288]  US-NATO forces mobilize as war comes to Europe.
[01:12:07.449 --> 01:12:08.650]  There's no negotiating with Putin.
[01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:12.111]  NATO must mobilize military might to fight.
[01:12:13.632 --> 01:12:15.853]  NATO in race against time to prepare for war with Russia.
[01:12:16.193 --> 01:12:16.613]  Newsweek.
[01:12:18.554 --> 01:12:20.375]  NATO mobilize 300 troops for war.
[01:12:21.115 --> 01:12:28.277]   Then we've got The founding of NATO and then documents from the 40s and the 70s calling it a European mobilization.
[01:12:28.317 --> 01:12:32.620]  That's what NATO is, is a mobilization against the former Soviet Union.
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:44.726]  So, they are saying it's false news to claim there's a mobilization, even though the German Chancellor three days ago said, we're preparing to declare an emergency for mobilization.
[01:12:45.267 --> 01:12:47.288]  Jack Vosobik, this is amazing.
[01:12:48.328 --> 01:12:50.690]  Where we're going into potentially thermal nuclear war.
[01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:52.091]  We're already in a proxy war.
[01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:53.411]  Hybrid war with Russia.
[01:12:53.812 --> 01:12:55.673]  You're a former neighbor intelligence, great reporter.
[01:12:55.933 --> 01:12:57.214]  You know your history, you know your facts.
[01:12:57.974 --> 01:12:58.975]  Our videos go viral.
[01:12:58.995 --> 01:13:01.537]  We probably reached 8 million people in the last three or four interviews.
[01:13:01.857 --> 01:13:02.838]  Just on X alone.
[01:13:02.858 --> 01:13:04.159]  It's been picked up all over.
[01:13:04.199 --> 01:13:05.199]  We're causing a debate.
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:07.761]  Maybe we need nuclear war with Russia.
[01:13:08.001 --> 01:13:09.302]  Maybe it's time to blow the planet up.
[01:13:09.642 --> 01:13:13.665]  But I think people, I'm being sarcastic, should be able to have a discussion about this.
[01:13:13.685 --> 01:13:14.726]  So thanks for joining us.
[01:13:15.626 --> 01:13:17.427]  This is five days in a row you've come on.
[01:13:18.528 --> 01:13:21.129]  About this, you're obviously with humanevents.com.
[01:13:22.429 --> 01:13:23.410]  What do you make of this?
[01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:27.711]  Look Alex, it's very clear what happened here.
[01:13:27.911 --> 01:13:37.074]  This is NATO's response to you and I. This is NATO responding to you and I because we have come out with the truth about what NATO is up to.
[01:13:37.354 --> 01:13:41.956]  Look, the German Chancellor was very clear declaring an emergency session.
[01:13:42.396 --> 01:13:52.638]  Then the new globalist Polish Prime Minister says we must mobilize the Western nations against Russia for Ukraine.
[01:13:52.878 --> 01:13:54.519]  We know exactly what he's talking about.
[01:13:54.819 --> 01:13:56.859]  Then you flashback to Lloyd Austin.
[01:13:57.139 --> 01:14:04.661]  Lloyd Austin goes to Congress and Lloyd Austin says we will send your sons and daughters to fight Russia in Ukraine and in Europe.
[01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:05.982]  Then Zelensky comes.
[01:14:06.282 --> 01:14:08.824]  Zelensky gives his address to the U.S.
[01:14:08.864 --> 01:14:09.725]  military, to U.S.
[01:14:09.765 --> 01:14:11.266]  military officers, the head of Ukraine.
[01:14:11.586 --> 01:14:17.731]  And then he goes up on Fox News and he's saying, you have to stop spending money in the United States on your own problems.
[01:14:17.951 --> 01:14:18.952]  You must send your money.
[01:14:18.972 --> 01:14:19.953]  You must pay Ukraine.
[01:14:19.973 --> 01:14:21.073]  You must give Ukraine more.
[01:14:21.394 --> 01:14:22.314]  Joe Biden comes out.
[01:14:22.595 --> 01:14:23.635]  He stands with Ukraine.
[01:14:24.176 --> 01:14:25.637]  And then NATO comes to us.
[01:14:26.317 --> 01:14:30.881]  NATO comes after us and says, these are all defensive mobilizations.
[01:14:31.381 --> 01:14:33.443]  Defensive mobilizations.
[01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:38.321]  Alex, and you went through headline after headline in every single mainstream thing.
[01:14:38.581 --> 01:14:41.104]  What do you think the mobilizations are for?
[01:14:41.484 --> 01:14:44.407]  What do you think the mobilizations are targeted towards?
[01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:50.794]  And remember, the first head of NATO, when they asked him, the British Lord, and they said, what is the purpose of NATO?
[01:14:50.814 --> 01:14:54.318]  He said, the purpose of NATO is to keep the Germans down.
[01:14:54.858 --> 01:14:58.361]  To keep the Russians out and to keep the Americans in.
[01:14:58.581 --> 01:15:04.386]  And every NATO move since then has always been done in furtherance of that.
[01:15:04.686 --> 01:15:08.089]  The specific target has always been war with Russia.
[01:15:08.129 --> 01:15:21.160]  That's why in the 1990s when people said, why don't we turn NATO into counter-terrorism, counter-trafficking, counter-child-trafficking, counter-human-trafficking, counter-drug-trafficking organization, go after these terrorist groups.
[01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:24.701]  But the leaders of NATO and the leaders of the globalists said, no, no, no.
[01:15:24.721 --> 01:15:28.621]  NATO cannot be turned into a policing organization.
[01:15:28.701 --> 01:15:29.921]  No, we will not allow this.
[01:15:30.322 --> 01:15:32.522]  And special forces all over the world kind of like an air force.
[01:15:32.622 --> 01:15:34.902]  And that's because NATO's been caught running a lot of those things.
[01:15:34.942 --> 01:15:35.923]  But let me just back you up.
[01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:43.144]  You were on two days ago and you didn't know that right as you were speaking that they had finally gotten the new Polish leader into the parliament because they were debating.
[01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:45.664]  I said he was going to do this.
[01:15:45.684 --> 01:15:47.445]  He was doing it while I was on the show.
[01:15:47.465 --> 01:15:49.705]  I just showed the headline out of Poland.
[01:15:50.717 --> 01:15:52.818]  Calls for mobilization against Russia.
[01:15:52.858 --> 01:15:53.538]  This is Tusk.
[01:15:53.798 --> 01:15:56.498]  This is Tusk, who was the president of the European Council.
[01:15:56.538 --> 01:15:57.799]  He was the EU president.
[01:15:58.179 --> 01:16:04.520]  And then it says right there, the new Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, who is a disciple of the globalists.
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.041]  He is the globalist asset.
[01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:07.941]  He was one of the EU presidents.
[01:16:08.241 --> 01:16:09.822]  He's Merkel's deputy.
[01:16:10.162 --> 01:16:16.223]  And now he's saying that his government will mobilize to keep the world committed to helping Ukraine.
[01:16:16.483 --> 01:16:19.784]  He was calling for more mobilization of all the world.
[01:16:19.684 --> 01:16:22.804]   western nation. And that's why they're trying to censor- So who's gonna be sent first? They're
[01:16:22.804 --> 01:16:28.043]   gonna send the Poles in first because the Poles are next door. It's so obvious, Alex.
[01:16:28.043 --> 01:16:32.644]   And they ran the false flag with the Polish farmers. They took out two Polish farmers.
[01:16:32.644 --> 01:16:36.423]   They said Putin did it. We later found out it was Zelensky's missiles. So they ran this
[01:16:36.423 --> 01:16:37.423]  op on Poland.
[01:16:37.477 --> 01:16:38.778]  Now what's going to happen the next time?
[01:16:38.999 --> 01:16:42.844]  Now there wasn't a globalist in charge of Poland when they did this last year.
[01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:45.829]  Now you've got the globalist Prime Minister that they snuck in there.
[01:16:46.069 --> 01:17:03.146]   So the question is, what happens when they run the op again, kill another couple of Polish farmers, Have the missiles drop on them, or God forbid, a Polish village, a Polish town, a Polish city, that's right on the border with Ukraine, they blame it on Putin, and then boom, the Polish government says, we are going to mobilize.
[01:17:03.286 --> 01:17:04.747]  It's so obvious, Alex.
[01:17:04.767 --> 01:17:06.068]  We can see it coming a mile away.
[01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:34.924]   And Jack, you know your history, that's why it's refreshing to talk to you, but for people who don't know how World War II officially began, the Nazis in Operation Himmler at Glywood had Jews that they had in a concentration camp that they dressed up, this is declassified Nuremberg trials, not debated, the Germans confessed to it, dressed the Jews up as Polish soldiers Shot them for exactly shot them for newsreels at a radio station.
[01:17:35.345 --> 01:17:43.028]  Claimed that they'd attacked a German communication station and then that's why the Nazis then attacked Poland at a World War I army.
[01:17:43.308 --> 01:17:46.429]  The Poles valiantly fought but got crushed by the modern military.
[01:17:46.769 --> 01:17:48.730]  That was basically 30 years more advanced than them.
[01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:53.231]  And so we're seeing an exact repeat of Operation Hemler.
[01:17:53.311 --> 01:17:57.273]  You called it, and they're all calling it mobilization for war with Russia.
[01:17:57.713 --> 01:18:00.114]  And then because I said to you, I said, the headline's key, Jack.
[01:18:00.674 --> 01:18:01.495]  What do we call this?
[01:18:01.515 --> 01:18:04.836]  And you said NATO mobilizing for direct war with Russia.
[01:18:05.376 --> 01:18:06.577]  And here's the debate.
[01:18:06.617 --> 01:18:09.138]  Here's the debate for X. Here's what I would say to the community.
[01:18:08.958 --> 01:18:13.837]   points for any mobilization and they go crap, Posobiec got the exact name right, so let's
[01:18:13.837 --> 01:18:15.158]  just say it's not true.
[01:18:15.158 --> 01:18:16.518]  So what do we do about this community notes?
[01:18:16.518 --> 01:18:20.658]   Because it's not about us being proven right, but we can make this a big deal on X to get
[01:18:20.658 --> 01:18:21.998]  a bigger debate going.
[01:18:21.998 --> 01:18:26.157]   Can we, community notes, can we, can we community notes the community notes?
[01:18:26.157 --> 01:18:27.157]  Listen, here's what I would say.
[01:18:27.157 --> 01:18:28.837]  Here's what I would say to the community notes.
[01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:32.458]   And people who are on there can go into the community notes and challenge this and say,
[01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:37.118]   if we're running a story that's critical of an organization, you can't use that organization
[01:18:37.118 --> 01:18:39.118]  as a source against us.
[01:18:39.094 --> 01:18:44.895]  How can you cite NATO as the source when we're running a story that's being critical of NATO?
[01:18:45.135 --> 01:18:46.315]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:18:46.635 --> 01:18:52.636]  You're responding to us with NATO's commentary and NATO's own official statement as the source.
[01:18:52.856 --> 01:18:53.616]  You can't do that.
[01:18:53.896 --> 01:19:00.337]   You need to have a source that's independent, actual, independent source. You can't be sourcing back to the exact
[01:19:00.337 --> 01:19:04.096]   target. They say, "Okay, we deny it, we deny it." Of course they're going to deny it,
[01:19:04.096 --> 01:19:08.346]   okay? Show me something that is actually an independent source that says
[01:19:08.346 --> 01:19:12.695]   NATO is not mobilizing for a war with Russia, and then we can have that
[01:19:12.695 --> 01:19:16.815]   discussion. But the idea that you would use themselves as the source on
[01:19:16.815 --> 01:19:21.256]   themselves, it completely fives the weight of what any community
[01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:24.176]   noting is supposed to be. Well, that was my question for you, because I respect your
[01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:25.676]  research view on this.
[01:19:26.050 --> 01:19:28.833]  I know a lot of you know more than me on this, one of the smartest guys on it.
[01:19:29.493 --> 01:19:34.858]  How do we respond to a community note when the community note is the source that we're exposing?
[01:19:35.738 --> 01:19:39.301]  Anyone can apply to be a community noter, right?
[01:19:39.321 --> 01:19:42.224]  So anyone who's on the X platform can go in there.
[01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:44.043]  No, I know, but can we put a note...
[01:19:44.043 --> 01:19:46.043]   ...so all the people who are now signing up can get in there.
[01:19:46.043 --> 01:19:48.043]  But can you put a note on a note?
[01:19:48.043 --> 01:19:50.043]  You would have to put...
[01:19:50.043 --> 01:19:52.043]  You would have to screenshot it.
[01:19:52.043 --> 01:19:56.043]   So you could screenshot the note, and then you could put that on your account,
[01:19:56.043 --> 01:19:58.043]   and then you could ask people to put a note on the note that way.
[01:19:58.043 --> 01:20:00.043]  to put a note on the note that way.
[01:20:00.043 --> 01:20:10.043]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:20:01.219 --> 01:20:01.820]  On the new post.
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:08.987]  And of course Twitter, Twitter users can write a note, and again it isn't about you and I being proven right, we can use- Because it's not a community, that's called context added.
[01:20:09.248 --> 01:20:10.369]  So you're adding context.
[01:20:11.001 --> 01:20:12.563]  Again, this isn't about you and I being proven right.
[01:20:12.663 --> 01:20:19.352]  It's about using their lie to trigger a larger Twitter debate about the fact that we're sliding into full war with Russia.
[01:20:19.712 --> 01:20:24.138]  No, Alex, I've been saying since day one and coming on the show this week, I want to be wrong.
[01:20:24.598 --> 01:20:25.399]  I worry much.
[01:20:25.499 --> 01:20:26.441]  Please prove me wrong.
[01:20:26.901 --> 01:20:33.583]  Please prove me wrong that NATO and the leaders of the globalists do not want war with Russia, and that they're not mobilizing for war with Russia.
[01:20:34.123 --> 01:20:48.847]  But show me one of them that's calling for peace, show me one of these world leaders that's making moves for peace, because I'm looking at the guns of August right now, in the outbreak of World War I. That's what I'm looking at when I see the European battle structure as pertains to the East and as pertains to Eurasia.
[01:20:49.027 --> 01:20:56.894]   Because the guns are being pointed, the soldiers are marching, the tanks are already being put on the trains, So you tell me that I'm making it all up.
[01:20:57.114 --> 01:20:58.957]  So I want to be proven wrong.
[01:20:58.856 --> 01:21:00.856]  I would love to be proven wrong.
[01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:03.856]   But Jack, I'm going to shut up, I want to hear your great analysis.
[01:21:03.856 --> 01:21:05.856]   I'm going to shut up right now and then I'm going to have my points after.
[01:21:05.856 --> 01:21:08.856]  But here's the point of the gaslighting.
[01:21:08.856 --> 01:21:11.856]  NATO was founded as a mobilization against the Soviet Union.
[01:21:11.736 --> 01:21:13.717]  It was kept after the fall of the Soviet Union, as you pointed out.
[01:21:13.757 --> 01:21:14.817]  I showed all the documents earlier.
[01:21:15.558 --> 01:21:22.981]  They are literally saying, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the President, that we're going to go to full war with U.S.
[01:21:23.421 --> 01:21:24.421]  troops imminently.
[01:21:24.821 --> 01:21:25.302]  Get ready.
[01:21:25.402 --> 01:21:37.829]   Those are verbal escalations of total war escalations, and the fact that we have to debate whether we're sliding into Direct conflict is just ridiculous, but that's how the left always does it.
[01:21:38.109 --> 01:21:39.551]  They deny the border's broken.
[01:21:39.871 --> 01:21:42.634]  They deny- We're not sliding into direct conflict.
[01:21:43.174 --> 01:21:44.015]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:21:44.736 --> 01:21:48.499]  We're not sleepwalking into the nuclear holocaust of World War III.
[01:21:48.759 --> 01:21:49.680]  We're not doing it.
[01:21:49.921 --> 01:21:51.222]  Don't worry, everything's fine.
[01:21:51.462 --> 01:21:54.245]  Alex, trust the experts, just like during COVID.
[01:21:54.585 --> 01:21:56.006]  Trust the experts.
[01:21:56.026 --> 01:21:57.548]  You must trust Klaus Schwab.
[01:21:57.588 --> 01:22:02.969]   You must trust World Health Organization, trust Xi Jinping, trust him.
[01:22:02.969 --> 01:22:07.328]   There's no human to human contact, it will not be traced, this was not tested in Wuhan
[01:22:07.328 --> 01:22:08.328]  lab.
[01:22:08.328 --> 01:22:09.328]  It's ridiculous, Alex.
[01:22:09.328 --> 01:22:13.729]   They're saying that we should trust them and everything's being done defensively when,
[01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:18.889]   look, that the key point here, Alex, that people need to understand is this is the same
[01:22:18.889 --> 01:22:23.409]   line of thinking that caused Russia to invade Ukraine in the first place.
[01:22:23.617 --> 01:22:46.171]   Because NATO kept pushing and pushing and pushing until the point where Russia got sick of it and they said, look, if you are not going to listen to us anymore, if you are going to stop agreeing to these peace deals, if you are not going to abide by the Minsk Accords, then we feel we have no further chance than to defend Russia, than to conduct this invasion to make you understand.
[01:22:46.371 --> 01:22:49.653]  And I'm not saying I agree with it, I'm saying that's what they said.
[01:22:50.073 --> 01:22:51.434]  That's why they did this.
[01:22:51.674 --> 01:22:58.058]  And you can talk to any Russian, even like the liberal anti-Putin Russians will admit this, that they view NATO as a threat.
[01:22:58.278 --> 01:23:01.079]   Because at the end of the day, it is a globalist In Canada.
[01:23:00.899 --> 01:23:04.818]  on their borders and Alex, no serious country.
[01:23:04.818 --> 01:23:13.578]   All right, if the communists in China were putting tanks and missiles and Navy, Navy flotillas,
[01:23:13.578 --> 01:23:19.499]   all in Canada and Mexico, then I would expect and I would demand that the US government
[01:23:19.499 --> 01:23:24.618]   do something about it and send the US military after them before that military could be built up.
[01:23:24.618 --> 01:23:26.298]  In fact, I would demand it and guess what?
[01:23:26.298 --> 01:23:29.899]  So would any serious leader of any serious country.
[01:23:29.899 --> 01:23:36.459]   So what you're saying is under doctrine, under law, under military common, just default position,
[01:23:36.459 --> 01:23:37.699]  this is an act of war.
[01:23:37.690 --> 01:23:38.650]  Putin said, I'm going in.
[01:23:38.670 --> 01:23:41.492]  I know you're trying to move Ukraine into NATO.
[01:23:41.592 --> 01:23:42.272]  Oh, no, we're not.
[01:23:42.352 --> 01:23:44.933]  And now they say we're bypassing the regular laws.
[01:23:44.973 --> 01:23:48.454]  We're just going to bring them in, which again is a huge escalation.
[01:23:49.015 --> 01:23:55.137]   This is madness because NATO and Russia Conventionally, if they stalemate, they stalemate.
[01:23:55.157 --> 01:24:04.781]  But if one side starts losing, the doctrine is tactical nukes, then that goes to theater nukes, then that goes to strategic nukes, then that goes to- Well, you got Orban out there yesterday.
[01:24:04.961 --> 01:24:12.383]  Orban's the only one calling to pump the brakes here, because they were about to put Ukraine into the EU yesterday.
[01:24:12.644 --> 01:24:16.765]  But Orban pumped the brakes, and he used the veto of Hungary to hold this all up.
[01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:21.467]  Because people have to understand that EU membership does have a military component to it.
[01:24:21.587 --> 01:24:27.747]   and EU membership is a backdoor way of sliding everyone into NATO membership.
[01:24:27.747 --> 01:24:34.506]   And so Orban is one of the only people, people say, "Orban, oh, he's a dick-tad, he's an autocrat."
[01:24:34.506 --> 01:24:38.306]   Orban's one of the only people who's actually calling for peace
[01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:42.306]   and asking for people to come to their senses and back down a little bit,
[01:24:42.306 --> 01:24:47.987]   pump the brakes on all of this Ukraine talk, because Ukraine, the more we push Ukraine
[01:24:47.987 --> 01:24:51.867]   into these military alliances, the more the Russians feel threatened
[01:24:51.867 --> 01:24:56.907]   and the more willing the Russians are to continue their military operations,
[01:24:56.907 --> 01:24:57.986]  which we've seen them conduct.
[01:24:57.986 --> 01:24:59.626]  And what did Putin say yesterday, Alex?
[01:24:59.626 --> 01:25:00.587]  What did Putin say yesterday?
[01:25:00.587 --> 01:25:05.747]   He said, "This will continue until our objectives have been complete."
[01:25:05.747 --> 01:25:07.346]  They're done talking.
[01:25:07.346 --> 01:25:09.306]  They're done talking completely.
[01:25:09.306 --> 01:25:12.187]   And so the question is, when they've gone to full war mode,
[01:25:12.761 --> 01:25:15.721]  done because we push them into it, all right?
[01:25:15.721 --> 01:25:19.180]  The question is, do we respond with more war?
[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:25.240]   Or do we show them the positive signs that we will drop the mobilization, right, that
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:31.820]   we will drop the mobilization and start to wind things down vis-a-vis Ukraine?
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:33.980]  If we do that, we can prevent World War III.
[01:25:33.978 --> 01:25:34.778]  It's very simple.
[01:25:34.999 --> 01:25:41.326]  But Alex, I don't think there's anyone in Brussels or anyone in these globalist elite cabal who's willing to do that, and that's why we must smash them.
[01:25:41.486 --> 01:25:42.307]  We are forced to do so.
[01:25:42.487 --> 01:25:48.994]  Well, that's my next question is, is NATO just doing this to get more troops and more funding and more money laundering power?
[01:25:49.995 --> 01:25:51.236]  Or are they delusional enough?
[01:25:51.296 --> 01:25:53.739]  Is this a bargaining chip before a deal with Russia?
[01:25:54.299 --> 01:25:55.841]  Because obviously NATO's been defeated.
[01:25:56.161 --> 01:26:01.206]  Or is NATO going to go ahead and escalate when it only leads, according to every analyst, to nuclear war?
[01:26:01.246 --> 01:26:03.608]  I mean, that's why this is just so preposterous.
[01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:10.105]  Look Alex, at the end of the day, I think they're terrified.
[01:26:10.406 --> 01:26:14.231]  Because they see what Russia has done, because people need to understand, Russia's been planning for this for 30 years.
[01:26:14.751 --> 01:26:22.030]   And so Russia built an economy that would be centrally contained enough where they knew
[01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:25.150]   they would get sanctioned over this, they knew the financial fallout from this,
[01:26:25.150 --> 01:26:26.150]  but what did they do?
[01:26:26.150 --> 01:26:31.570]   They built a parallel economy and a parallel structure with China, with the BRICS nations.
[01:26:31.570 --> 01:26:36.470]   They've set this up as a complete alternative to the Swiss system and to the Western-backed
[01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:37.590]  Western capital.
[01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:44.630]   And so if you are part of that Western internationalist financial system, normally you have to obey
[01:26:44.630 --> 01:26:47.911]   whatever the globalists tell you to do because you're stuck.
[01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:53.288]  They will ruin your country, they will destroy you with debt, they'll destroy you with the IMF, they'll destroy you with the World Bank.
[01:26:53.548 --> 01:27:09.974]  But what Putin did was he got Russia out of debt, and then he said, I'm going to set up our country based on manufacturing, based on domestic industry, based on domestic natural resources, like the oil of Russia, like Trump was trying to do with the oil resources, the natural gas of the United States, so that America could be self-sufficient.
[01:27:10.194 --> 01:27:15.536]  So that we wouldn't be beholden to international capital anymore because Putin did that.
[01:27:15.796 --> 01:27:25.259]  He stands now a massive threat to the financial instruments of power and leverage throughout Western Europe and throughout the United States.
[01:27:25.299 --> 01:27:34.485]   People need to understand that this isn't about This isn't about, you know, Russia hates the American people or China even hates the American people necessarily.
[01:27:34.505 --> 01:27:39.169]  This is an oligarch fight that is taking place on the highest level.
[01:27:39.489 --> 01:27:45.114]  The only part where the people get involved are when it comes to who goes to the front and who goes to die.
[01:27:45.214 --> 01:27:57.303]  And we've seen that Zelensky and now even Lloyd Austin are willing to send people all the way up into their 40s, maybe even their 60s, to their deaths in furtherance of this crooked empire.
[01:27:57.643 --> 01:27:58.765]  And that's my next question.
[01:27:58.785 --> 01:28:01.868]  I read all the establishment publications.
[01:28:01.908 --> 01:28:03.590]  Their only hope is a coup against Putin.
[01:28:04.311 --> 01:28:07.475]  And they keep hoping for it on CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post.
[01:28:07.495 --> 01:28:10.299]  If you get a coup against Putin, the generals are going to take charge.
[01:28:10.339 --> 01:28:11.180]  You don't want that.
[01:28:11.801 --> 01:28:15.083]  Let me tell you something, Putin's not exactly a hardliner in Russia.
[01:28:15.283 --> 01:28:17.825]  You got guys in Russia right now, they're saying just nuke Brussels.
[01:28:18.185 --> 01:28:19.786]  They're saying just nuke it and be over with it.
[01:28:20.086 --> 01:28:23.048]  They're saying, like, if that's where the head of the snake is, then just nuke it.
[01:28:23.068 --> 01:28:27.391]  And Putin's saying, look, we think we can stabilize the situation and get down.
[01:28:28.452 --> 01:28:42.483]  Look, the last time the West conducted a regime change operation in Russia, the Germans said, if we just get rid of the Tsar by sending over a couple Bolsheviks on a train, then we'll get something better.
[01:28:42.764 --> 01:28:44.185]  That was 1917.
[01:28:44.585 --> 01:28:47.388]  Alex, what happened after 1917 in Russia?
[01:28:47.428 --> 01:28:50.090]  Did we get a better government than we had before, or a worse one?
[01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:52.172]  No, a giant expansion is cancer.
[01:28:52.232 --> 01:28:53.213]  So let me ask you this.
[01:28:53.873 --> 01:29:01.801]  What are the globalists, the big banks, the black rocks, who feel like they're removed because they're not getting the blame for this, but they're going to get nuked too, what are they thinking?
[01:29:01.821 --> 01:29:12.430]  Because I look at every angle, I see no way out of them making a deal, Russia gets a little bit of Ukraine, they end NATO expansion and just move on, but they just can't.
[01:29:12.551 --> 01:29:14.653]  So what are the globalists thinking?
[01:29:14.873 --> 01:29:16.034]  And then what's the way out here?
[01:29:17.699 --> 01:29:43.253]  Look, Alex, the globalists are still thinking, I'm telling you, the globalists are still thinking that, okay, if we can just take out Putin, if we can just assassinate him, if we can just get rid of him, if we can do anything to take him out of power, then maybe we can get another Yeltsin in there, another one of these meat puppets, you know, one of these vodka puppets, that they can just run around so they can continue to rape the resources of Russia the way that they've been raping the resources of Ukraine since the Maidan coup in 2013.
[01:29:44.013 --> 01:29:46.114]  That's why Hunter Biden is over there with Burisma.
[01:29:46.334 --> 01:29:47.394]  That's why he's up there.
[01:29:47.434 --> 01:29:48.315]  That's why he's getting the money.
[01:29:48.335 --> 01:29:49.495]  It's not about Hunter Biden.
[01:29:49.695 --> 01:29:50.856]  It's not about Joe Biden either.
[01:29:50.896 --> 01:29:58.118]  It's about the globalists getting the money from the financial resources and the mineral resources of Ukraine.
[01:29:58.278 --> 01:30:01.600]  Plus, by the way, you want to talk about Ukraine in terms of resources.
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.380]  What does Ukraine have, Alex?
[01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:05.901]  The black soil, okay?
[01:30:06.121 --> 01:30:12.724]  The black soil of Ukraine, which is so, so strong, so nutrient rich that you're not, it is illegal to export this, this out.
[01:30:13.064 --> 01:30:31.630]  Now, the EU has a ban on GMOs, so Monsanto and BlackRock and all these guys, they're looking at the breadbasket of Ukraine, the farmland, the black soil, and they understand that if they can get in there, then boom, they can get GMOs grown in Ukraine and then get that right to market all throughout Africa.
[01:30:31.670 --> 01:30:33.351]  Absolutely, but there's got to be a way.
[01:30:33.511 --> 01:30:34.391]  That's what they want.
[01:30:34.591 --> 01:30:39.030]   What we need, Alex, what I hope and pray for is that we can get this with, by smashing
[01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:43.270]   these globalists, by getting people like Trump in office, then we can at least get back to
[01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:44.870]  some kind of frozen stalemate.
[01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:50.110]   But as you said, the globalist cherry on top is using an expanded war with Russia as a
[01:30:50.110 --> 01:30:55.110]   civil emergency for the election, and so many of these people aren't even military, they're
[01:30:55.747 --> 01:31:01.852]  And Alex, what Richard Barris, Richard Barris came on my program yesterday and issued an extreme warning.
[01:31:01.912 --> 01:31:08.138]  He said the Nikki Haley push right now, that we're seeing within the United States, and we hear people start to seed this out into the net.
[01:31:08.158 --> 01:31:08.698]  Nikki Haley!
[01:31:08.718 --> 01:31:23.313]   Nikki Haley as the VP, Nikki Haley as Trump's VP, and Richard Barris came in and with steely eyes he said, Jack, if they put Nikki Haley as the Vice President, For Donald Trump, then that means he's going to be assassinated.
[01:31:23.693 --> 01:31:34.860]  That means they're going to take him out, and that she will take power, and that the CIA's girl herself, the CIA princess, will be right there, and then she will empower the absolute worst elements of our government.
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:37.101]  Trump would never be dumb enough to do that, would he?
[01:31:37.161 --> 01:31:38.982]  I mean, he already brought in bad people the first time.
[01:31:39.522 --> 01:31:40.363]  Where is this coming from?
[01:31:41.741 --> 01:31:55.468]  Look, because you're getting all of these people, you're getting Boeing, you're getting Lockheed, you're getting the defense contractors, because they realized that their guy originally, they all lined up behind DeSantis, but that completely collapsed under its own weight.
[01:31:55.807 --> 01:31:59.686]   And so with Nikki Haley, suddenly they realized to say, wait a minute, we had Nikki Haley
[01:31:59.686 --> 01:32:03.287]   in the Trump administration the first time she was the UN ambassador member,
[01:32:03.287 --> 01:32:04.407]  and she was calling for what?
[01:32:04.407 --> 01:32:06.407]  Mobilization into Syria, right?
[01:32:06.407 --> 01:32:07.507]  That was the war back then.
[01:32:07.507 --> 01:32:10.127]  We were gonna get into war with Russia through Syria.
[01:32:10.127 --> 01:32:12.527]  That was the play during the Trump administration.
[01:32:12.527 --> 01:32:13.448]  Trump held against it.
[01:32:13.448 --> 01:32:18.006]   Nikki Haley, H.R. McMaster were huge pushers, John Kelly, huge pushers of this.
[01:32:18.006 --> 01:32:18.908]  Trump held against it.
[01:32:18.908 --> 01:32:22.948]   Now the play is to get the US into war with Russia through Ukraine.
[01:32:22.948 --> 01:32:27.568]   But the goal has always been war with Russia, and they've been doing this for over a decade.
[01:32:27.324 --> 01:32:34.715]  And that's why I love that they'll community note Alex Jones and Jack Posobiec when we just point out the obvious goal of all of their moves for over 10 years now.
[01:32:35.267 --> 01:32:38.709]  That's right, Jack Posobiec at Human Events.
[01:32:39.190 --> 01:32:40.270]  Well, we've been vindicated.
[01:32:40.290 --> 01:32:43.052]  We need to make a big deal about this on X because it's not about us.
[01:32:43.092 --> 01:32:44.893]  It's about, no, we're going into war.
[01:32:45.014 --> 01:32:45.654]  It's escalating.
[01:32:45.694 --> 01:32:46.494]  It's mobilizing.
[01:32:46.695 --> 01:32:49.175]  They don't want you to know this America or Europe.
[01:32:49.175 --> 01:32:50.175]  This is...
[01:32:50.175 --> 01:32:53.895]   Before I run, before I run here, because I got my show starting in five minutes.
[01:32:53.895 --> 01:32:55.735]  God bless Michael Cassidy.
[01:32:55.735 --> 01:32:59.054]  God bless him for what he did in that Iowa Statehouse.
[01:32:59.054 --> 01:33:01.294]  Do not make peace with evil.
[01:33:01.294 --> 01:33:02.294]  Destroy it.
[01:33:02.294 --> 01:33:03.295]  Death to Satan.
[01:33:03.295 --> 01:33:04.295]  Christ is King.
[01:33:04.295 --> 01:33:08.374]   Going in there, decapitating, they said, that satanic display.
[01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:15.455]  That's the other thing that we're talking about and I understand that Michael Cassidy It's at vote Cassidy on X. He's got some legal issues.
[01:33:15.475 --> 01:33:26.464]  He raised $20,000 in the first three hours We're now he's now facing more charges Potentially because we're told this DA is one of these Storo style DA's in Des Moines We need to help this Patriot out.
[01:33:26.504 --> 01:33:31.264]   His name is Michael Michael Cassidy and I urge everyone to go to X @VoteCassidy,
[01:33:31.264 --> 01:33:35.315]   help him out because he did what Kim Reynolds and these others were not willing to
[01:33:35.315 --> 01:33:35.684]  do.
[01:33:35.684 --> 01:33:39.284]   And by the way, Kim Reynolds, you should issue a pardon of this patriot immediately.
[01:33:39.284 --> 01:33:43.005]   Yeah, they're taking down George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, but they're putting up Bathom
[01:33:43.005 --> 01:33:47.444]   Ed and that group literally says it's a sacrament to sacrifice babies in federal filing.
[01:33:47.444 --> 01:33:48.444]  It's all out in the open.
[01:33:48.444 --> 01:33:49.444]  Out in the open.
[01:33:49.444 --> 01:33:50.444]  Jack Mosellebich, thank you so much.
[01:33:50.444 --> 01:33:51.444]  God bless, Alex.
[01:33:51.444 --> 01:33:56.123]  Mike Adams is coming in with the deep dive on AI secrets.
[01:33:56.098 --> 01:33:57.479]  This is going to be so powerful.
[01:33:57.879 --> 01:33:59.159]  It ties into everything.
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:02.301]  We're going to cover a lot of other big issues with Mike Adams as well.
[01:34:02.321 --> 01:34:03.321]  We'll air a few promos.
[01:34:03.721 --> 01:34:05.502]  His first five minutes, some stations don't carry it.
[01:34:05.842 --> 01:34:12.224]  And then we're going to come back in about six minutes with Mike Adams in studio today, the health ranger.
[01:34:12.845 --> 01:34:15.166]  And then boy, I tell you, just all hell's breaking loose.
[01:34:15.866 --> 01:34:16.806]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:34:16.826 --> 01:34:18.227]  Order your Christmas presents now.
[01:34:19.107 --> 01:34:20.108]  X2 back in stock.
[01:34:19.927 --> 01:34:21.927]  Turbo Force Package Dog.
[01:34:21.927 --> 01:34:25.927]  (Music)
[01:34:25.927 --> 01:34:27.927]  (Explosion)
[01:34:27.927 --> 01:34:29.927]  (Music)
[01:34:29.927 --> 01:34:31.927]  On this vote, the A's are 221 and the N's are 212.
[01:34:31.927 --> 01:34:35.367]  and the Nays are 2-12.
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:34.961]  The resolution is adopted.
[01:34:36.363 --> 01:34:41.410]  One could only hope that we are witnessing the Biden crime family's last stand.
[01:34:41.670 --> 01:34:42.491]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[01:34:44.739 --> 01:34:52.443]  And now that the ball is firmly in the hands of the GOP, will they purposely fumble in order to protect the Uniparty?
[01:34:52.723 --> 01:34:54.104]  Are you going forward with contempt?
[01:34:54.964 --> 01:34:55.364]  I'll let you know.
[01:34:55.384 --> 01:34:56.605]  There's a process you have to follow.
[01:34:56.625 --> 01:34:57.985]  You have to file a report.
[01:34:58.185 --> 01:34:59.566]  But we will begin looking at that.
[01:34:59.706 --> 01:35:04.028]  Both the lawyers for the Oversight Committee and the lawyers for the District Committee will move in that direction.
[01:35:04.428 --> 01:35:06.069]  But look, Congress asked you to come.
[01:35:06.089 --> 01:35:07.570]  You're supposed to come and testify.
[01:35:08.710 --> 01:35:16.156]  The Democrats have proven that their only contribution to the future of the Republic is weaponized gaslighting and hypocrisy.
[01:35:16.536 --> 01:35:21.960]  They are going to try to impeach President Biden despite the fact that there's no evidence against him at all.
[01:35:22.781 --> 01:35:31.067]  Trump sent a violent MAGA mob here to the Capitol to reverse the election results and certify that he won even though he lost.
[01:35:31.747 --> 01:35:36.210]  What they couldn't do on January 6th, they want to do with this extreme political stunt.
[01:35:36.671 --> 01:35:41.915]  Bordering on collusion with the Biden family's massive evidence of foreign bribery.
[01:35:42.035 --> 01:35:54.464]  The idea that they are going to somehow get to President Biden through his son, who was drug addicted, and the only thing that they have revealed in these hearings is that we have a president that loves his son even through his imperfections.
[01:35:54.604 --> 01:36:08.731]   Not only is the committee not allowing Hunter Biden to testify publicly, But they have not called a single witness, a single first-hand witness, to any of their allegations.
[01:36:09.291 --> 01:36:18.895]  They haven't allowed anybody to testify publicly because they do not have a single witness to any of their alleged allegations.
[01:36:19.255 --> 01:36:19.776]  They don't.
[01:36:20.076 --> 01:36:32.183]   While Republicans meekly refuse to enforce the very same laws used against the Trump administration, The Trump advisor and conservative agitator now on trial.
[01:36:32.403 --> 01:36:35.065]  This show trial they're running, isn't this great?
[01:36:35.125 --> 01:36:38.963]  five congressional subpoenas on the January 6th committee.
[01:36:38.963 --> 01:36:42.725]   -I hope that the committee goes after them and holds them accountable.
[01:36:42.725 --> 01:36:44.324]  -Should they be prosecuted by the Justice Department?
[01:36:44.324 --> 01:36:45.364]  -I do, yes.
[01:36:45.364 --> 01:36:47.005]  -It's a shame that Mr.
[01:36:47.005 --> 01:36:53.364]   Bannon has put us in this position, but we won't take no for an answer.
[01:36:53.364 --> 01:36:54.163]  We believe Mr.
[01:36:54.163 --> 01:37:00.484]   Bannon has information relevant to our probe, and we'll use the tools at our disposal
[01:37:00.484 --> 01:37:02.003]  to get that information.
[01:37:01.963 --> 01:37:11.274]  Tonight, a jury convicting former senior Trump White House aide Peter Navarro of criminal contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the January 6th committee.
[01:37:11.534 --> 01:37:25.464]  After Hunter Biden refused a deposition, Hunter had claimed to want to answer all questions in the name of transparency, then proceeded to answer nothing and make his escape blatantly in contempt of Congress.
[01:37:25.604 --> 01:37:33.150]  I'm here today to answer at a public hearing any legitimate questions Chairman Comer and the House Oversight Committee may have for me.
[01:37:34.617 --> 01:37:45.762]  I'm here today to make sure that the House Committee's illegitimate investigations of my family do not proceed on distortions, manipulated evidence, and lies.
[01:37:47.023 --> 01:37:54.847]  For six years, I have been the target of the unrelenting Trump attack machine shouting, where's Hunter?
[01:37:55.987 --> 01:37:57.028]  Well, here's my answer.
[01:37:58.328 --> 01:37:58.949]  I am here.
[01:38:01.450 --> 01:38:03.431]  Let me state as clearly as I can.
[01:38:04.873 --> 01:38:12.330]  My father was not financially involved in my business, not as a practicing lawyer, not as a board member of BRISMA.
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:20.787]  Not in my partnership with a Chinese private business man, not in my investments at home nor abroad, and certainly not as an artist.
[01:38:21.167 --> 01:38:22.949]  But will the GOP act?
[01:38:23.309 --> 01:38:36.080]  And now that the Biden crime family has been backed into a corner where the inquiry can get to the finer details and subpoena witnesses, how will the Bidens retaliate against the American people?
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:39.882]  What lengths will the DOJ go to protect them now?
[01:38:40.603 --> 01:38:44.926]  Attorney General Garland leads 115,000 employees.
[01:38:45.486 --> 01:38:49.809]  Prosecutors, agents of the FBI, and other federal law enforcement.
[01:38:49.989 --> 01:38:57.274]  And how quickly will false flags and cyber attacks randomly appear as Congress returns after the holidays?
[01:38:57.794 --> 01:39:04.319]  But I think it's more likely we're going to end up, if we end up in a war, a real shooting war.
[01:39:05.247 --> 01:39:09.010]  With a major power, it's going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach.
[01:39:10.011 --> 01:39:15.576]  Based on evolving intelligence, Russia may be planning a cyber attack against us.
[01:39:15.596 --> 01:39:22.022]  2024 is shaping up to be one of the most interesting and dangerous years in American history.
[01:39:22.463 --> 01:39:29.185]  All right, well Mikey Adams is a scientist and best-selling author and researcher and a good friend of mine for many years, been interviewing him for 20 years or so.
[01:39:29.686 --> 01:39:42.070]   He's lived in Austin for 15 or outside Austin and he's done some deep research on AI and a lot of it parallels, I'm not an engineer, but from what I've been studying, And how this all really works and operates.
[01:39:42.090 --> 01:39:46.611]  So we're going to kind of define where the world is today and what AI is.
[01:39:47.151 --> 01:39:54.793]  And then these statements, I got a clip coming up here in a few minutes of Larry Page, the founder of Google, with Klaus Schwab saying, we don't need elections soon.
[01:39:55.313 --> 01:40:00.215]  AI will decide all of this for everyone.
[01:40:00.255 --> 01:40:04.316]  But only if we decide to hand our authority over to it.
[01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:13.443]  Okay, so, but it's not just that we can sit there and understand how AI works.
[01:40:13.484 --> 01:40:16.907]  We can also be involved in our own AIs and counter this.
[01:40:16.927 --> 01:40:27.677]  And that's what the power structure, that's what the establishment is really, really, really, really massively concerned about as well, Mike Adams.
[01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:30.792]  Well, absolutely, and Alex, it's great to be here.
[01:40:30.812 --> 01:40:47.690]   I brought some key documents that we're going to go over, and we have some excerpts from these documents from DHS, a key memorandum from Homeland Security, as well as CISA documents that make what I believe are key admissions about how they're going to weaponize AI against the
[01:40:47.690 --> 01:40:48.661]  American people.
[01:40:48.661 --> 01:40:53.340]   And in fact, right now on InfoWars.com, there's an article that talks about how free speech
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:56.041]  is going to be designated a cyber threat.
[01:40:56.041 --> 01:41:00.500]   And that's actually one of the key things we need to understand here today, that the
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:06.699]   cyber security that's being unleashed upon every level of government in the United States
[01:41:07.386 --> 01:41:18.775]  We'll say that we need, quote, safety for AI systems and safety, Alex, means that you are silenced and that I am silenced and that anybody questioning the official narratives is absolutely silenced.
[01:41:19.295 --> 01:41:27.738]  So guardrails, safety, quote, responsible use of AI, these are all terms that actually mean they're going to weaponize it against the American people.
[01:41:28.098 --> 01:41:33.800]  And the WF just came out this week with a new report saying the main threat isn't somebody hacking your system, it's disinfo.
[01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:38.901]  So they're saying we're going to use AI to counter disinfo, but actually we're the ones telling the truth.
[01:41:39.342 --> 01:41:41.342]  All the stuff coming out of Klaus Schwab is pure bull.
[01:41:41.822 --> 01:41:42.783]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:41:43.983 --> 01:41:47.365]  Look, there's so many key bombshells to just share with you here on your show today.
[01:41:47.846 --> 01:42:00.034]  One of the key ones is that the reason we now know, the reason that you were censored and deplatformed for so many years, and myself and so many others, was not simply to censor and silence us in that moment in time.
[01:42:00.794 --> 01:42:22.350]  It was to make sure that the web scraping that's being used to train the large language models, the LLMs, which are being, those are the underlying models that would be used to run governments and hospitals and corporations, to make sure that those models were not exposed to your speech, Alex, or InfoWars articles or Natural News articles or anybody in the alternative media.
[01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:26.332]  It was about making sure that the training was woke.
[01:42:26.873 --> 01:42:40.101]  And one of the things that we need to do as pro-human team humanity people is to learn how to train or what's called fine-tuning of large language model systems in order to remove the woke.
[01:42:40.762 --> 01:42:43.303]  And so that's exactly one thing that we're working on.
[01:42:43.363 --> 01:42:47.166]  I'll share some of that with you later, Alex, after we go through these documents and some of the bombshells.
[01:42:48.547 --> 01:42:49.368]  Mike, keep going here.
[01:42:49.588 --> 01:42:49.848]  Okay.
[01:42:50.068 --> 01:42:50.368]  All right.
[01:42:50.449 --> 01:42:52.650]  Well, let's start with Homeland Security.
[01:42:53.171 --> 01:42:59.976]  So here we have a memorandum, Homeland Security document, that your producers have as well.
[01:43:00.156 --> 01:43:15.785]   It's a memorandum, August 8th, policy statement 139-06 from Alejandro Mallorca's Homeland Security Covering the acquisition and use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies by DHS components.
[01:43:16.286 --> 01:43:29.789]  Now the key thing to understand here is this point where they talk about that they will use, they will protect AI technologies from cyber attacks and quote malicious degradation of algorithmic functions.
[01:43:30.749 --> 01:43:32.992]  That's the data it's fed to build it.
[01:43:33.193 --> 01:43:33.673]  Exactly.
[01:43:34.034 --> 01:43:36.317]  And that's the speech on the internet.
[01:43:36.898 --> 01:43:48.812]   So what it means is that if you are publishing something that disagrees with the vaccine agenda or disagrees with masks or lockdowns or war with Russia, you know, for God's sake, Or money printing or anything else.
[01:43:49.352 --> 01:43:59.436]  They will then begin to claim, Alex, that you are engaged in, quote, malicious degradation of algorithmic functions simply by publishing your articles online.
[01:43:59.477 --> 01:44:02.158]  You are interfering with their AI training.
[01:44:02.598 --> 01:44:17.510]   They will then justify, this is all in their documents, they will justify how to, quote, address the evolving threat How to protect AI technologies against novel cybersecurity threats and risks introduced by new applications of these technologies.
[01:44:17.991 --> 01:44:48.790]   In other words, what they're saying Alex, is that if you use AI anywhere in InfoWars, if you use an AI transcription engine, if you use AI graphics, if you use an AI summarizer, For your shows and articles, which everybody's going to be doing that soon, if not already, they're going to say you are weaponizing AI, and that you are therefore a cyber security threat, and they're justifying their own invocation of AI weaponization to defeat the threat, which is now InfoWars using AI tools.
[01:44:48.930 --> 01:44:57.572]  And that's why they've been fear-mongering so much everywhere, saying, we cannot let the general public have this, it's too dangerous, because they want to keep getting way ahead of everybody else.
[01:44:58.171 --> 01:44:58.972]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:44:59.312 --> 01:45:08.958]  So there's a very big, strong, open-source AI community that has put out many, many models, language models, chatbot models that you can use for training.
[01:45:08.978 --> 01:45:09.739]  You can build on these.
[01:45:10.179 --> 01:45:12.180]  These models can produce computer code.
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:14.582]  They can, of course, generate graphics.
[01:45:14.742 --> 01:45:15.983]  They can do summaries.
[01:45:16.043 --> 01:45:18.044]  They can generate letters and emails and so on.
[01:45:18.364 --> 01:45:20.586]  Some of them have basic reasoning capabilities as well.
[01:45:21.306 --> 01:45:42.773]   But there's an effort right now to control those systems and make sure that all open source systems are designated malicious or unsafe so that the powerful corporations, which is of course Google, IBM with its Watson X, Facebook, Meta, Microsoft, And we'll talk about Twitter here in a second with its Grok system.
[01:45:43.273 --> 01:45:48.557]  But there's an effort to make sure that only the large corporations have systems that are regulated and approved by the government.
[01:45:48.597 --> 01:45:57.302]  In fact, this CISA roadmap document right here, it's the 2023-24 CISA Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence document.
[01:45:57.322 --> 01:45:58.523]  Don't overhead shot that, go ahead.
[01:45:58.563 --> 01:45:59.744]  Overhead shot, yeah, sorry.
[01:46:00.004 --> 01:46:00.784]  I'm moving this stuff around.
[01:46:00.804 --> 01:46:01.445]  That's okay, go ahead.
[01:46:01.465 --> 01:46:07.949]  There's a key chart that I have on my desk here, one, two, three, four, five points of what CISA is going to do.
[01:46:08.849 --> 01:46:27.798]   This chart once you're able to decode this and read through or between the lines of what they're saying this is actually saying that they're going to use AI guidance to infiltrate every level of government town, local, county, tribal, state, and other--
[01:46:27.798 --> 01:46:29.359]  For enforcement.
[01:46:29.359 --> 01:46:31.759]  For enforcement of AI deployment.
[01:46:31.759 --> 01:46:37.698]   So this is actually the federal centralized control over AI deployment, which will affect elections.
[01:46:37.698 --> 01:46:39.198]  It will affect the courts.
[01:46:39.198 --> 01:46:44.439]   It will affect budgetary activities, and it will take over your local government using AI
[01:46:44.439 --> 01:46:51.538]   that is controlled by CISA, which as you know, Alex, CISA was involved in the rigging of the 2020 election
[01:46:51.538 --> 01:46:52.918]  against Donald Trump.
[01:46:52.918 --> 01:47:01.319]   We now know that CISA and DHS were involved in ordering big tech, which channels to censor and who to de-platform
[01:47:01.319 --> 01:47:03.917]  in order to silence voices that were pro-Trump.
[01:47:03.917 --> 01:47:09.399]   And now they're taking that to a whole new level with this new plan, this artificial intelligence roadmap
[01:47:09.399 --> 01:47:14.998]   in which they blatantly lie and say, "Oh, we won't use it for anything that's uncomfortable."
[01:47:14.638 --> 01:47:19.380]  By the way, we talked a week ago about you coming on doing this and then two days ago Schwab comes out.
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:20.940]  I covered it yesterday and it was the big report.
[01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:22.321]  It's in my stack, if you can grab it.
[01:47:22.701 --> 01:47:26.602]  And they say, well you think of somebody hacking your computer or stealing your credit cards, it's hacking.
[01:47:26.622 --> 01:47:26.942]  No, no, no.
[01:47:27.602 --> 01:47:38.488]   Anyone saying disinfo is infecting the system of AI and they said we're going to ban everyone But then they're the ones that constantly lie, so they want to program the AI full of lies.
[01:47:38.708 --> 01:47:39.148]  Absolutely.
[01:47:39.168 --> 01:47:47.756]  And we'll talk about this universe of content over here in a little bit, but let me read you a really important quote out of this document from DHS, the memorandum.
[01:47:48.377 --> 01:47:57.886]  It says that DHS will not use AI to improperly profile, target, or to discriminate against any individual or entity, and so on.
[01:47:58.206 --> 01:48:03.405]   But what that means is that they are willing to properly profile and target.
[01:48:03.405 --> 01:48:04.925]  I mean, you know how they use words.
[01:48:04.925 --> 01:48:08.525]   This is, you know, lawyer speak in order for them to have a workaround.
[01:48:08.525 --> 01:48:15.565]   They also say they will not use AI technology to enable improper, systemic, indiscriminate,
[01:48:15.565 --> 01:48:19.244]   or large-scale monitoring, surveillance, or tracking of individuals.
[01:48:19.454 --> 01:48:33.939]  So what that means, Alex, and you know very well that Mayorkas is actually, through DHS, he is funding the migrant invasion and occupation of the United States with the invasion camps in Panama that people like Michael Yan have covered before.
[01:48:34.159 --> 01:48:35.060]  I guess we're going to go to break here.
[01:48:36.474 --> 01:48:42.437]  We'll talk about that on the other side, how they're using migrant invasions and AI to displace America.
[01:48:42.977 --> 01:48:44.038]  This is huge, folks.
[01:48:44.078 --> 01:48:47.500]  This is the Deep Dive on AI and how we counter it with Mike Adams.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:48.440]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:50.981]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:48:51.041 --> 01:48:54.123]  The Health Ranger Mike Adams is with us.
[01:48:54.163 --> 01:48:58.645]  We're doing the Deep Dive on AI.
[01:48:58.785 --> 01:48:59.966]  What is it really?
[01:49:01.009 --> 01:49:08.038]   and what's happening with it right now, and then from the government documents out of the EU, the US, all of it, what
[01:49:08.038 --> 01:49:08.807]  are they deploying?
[01:49:08.807 --> 01:49:12.548]   We know China is supposedly way ahead of us, but this is being rolled out.
[01:49:12.548 --> 01:49:17.408]   What is the social credit score? It doesn't just track you, it tracks the businesses you work at, everything that ties
[01:49:17.408 --> 01:49:21.399]   into IBM, the ESGs, the central bank digital currencies. We'll be
[01:49:21.399 --> 01:49:22.707]  getting a glimpse of all of that.
[01:49:22.752 --> 01:49:24.514]  No more elections, it's being announced.
[01:49:24.955 --> 01:49:31.623]  They've got something big planned, and to do it, they're going to discriminate to get people used to accepting that.
[01:49:32.023 --> 01:49:33.505]  In the name of political correctness, Mike Adams.
[01:49:34.412 --> 01:49:42.295]  Exactly right, and continuing in this document, this is the DHS memorandum that our producers can show there.
[01:49:42.776 --> 01:49:55.461]  It's the August 8th policy statement, 139-06 from Alejandro Mayorkas, and it says specifically that they will not use AI to engage in, quote, impermissible discrimination.
[01:49:56.590 --> 01:50:03.015]  Against white people, essentially, and also Asian people tend to be targeted for discrimination, especially in our education system.
[01:50:03.295 --> 01:50:05.336]  But they won't use it for impermissible discrimination.
[01:50:05.356 --> 01:50:06.297]  So what does that mean, Alex?
[01:50:06.337 --> 01:50:10.200]  It means they will use AI for permissible discrimination.
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:20.928]  It's just as they're saying they won't use AI to improperly target people for surveillance or large-scale monitoring, which means they will use AI for, quote, proper targeting.
[01:50:21.628 --> 01:50:26.011]  And also, by the way, conservativetreehouse.com, they did a breakdown of this.
[01:50:26.031 --> 01:50:29.373]  I want to give them credit for initially finding this.
[01:50:29.854 --> 01:50:39.620]  So I went through all these documents and the CISA roadmap on top of that to find all these other things that we're going to talk about here, including the fact that, quote, AI enhanced attacks.
[01:50:40.471 --> 01:50:43.192]  is the label they're going to use for free speech now.
[01:50:43.192 --> 01:50:47.831]   So like I said earlier, if you use any AI tools in your studio whatsoever,
[01:50:47.831 --> 01:50:50.871]   they're going to say that you're using an AI-enhanced attack
[01:50:50.871 --> 01:50:53.591]  or that you're engaged in malicious activity.
[01:50:53.591 --> 01:50:57.911]   And in addition, by the way, you know, you will have an avatar.
[01:50:58.104 --> 01:51:07.487]  There will be an Alex Jones avatar, probably, that your own organization creates, a large language model based on your speech, your videos over all the years.
[01:51:08.147 --> 01:51:18.250]  That avatar is something that you can query yourself, you could use... It'll have all the recordings, everything you ever said over 30 years on air, and then people can ask it questions.
[01:51:18.450 --> 01:51:19.170]  Right, right.
[01:51:19.410 --> 01:51:24.152]   And that avatar will be deemed A malicious threat.
[01:51:24.392 --> 01:51:27.313]  So what they're doing is, it's like they want the nuclear weapons, we don't get them.
[01:51:27.613 --> 01:51:28.293]  Well, exactly.
[01:51:28.313 --> 01:51:29.134]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:29.814 --> 01:51:37.337]  But understand that the underlying language models that are going to be... So they're not just going to ban people, they're going to ban our avatars.
[01:51:37.518 --> 01:51:38.018]  Absolutely.
[01:51:38.698 --> 01:51:39.118]  Absolutely.
[01:51:39.718 --> 01:51:46.261]  And in addition to that, and we've got to talk about this, the humanoid robot factories from China, they go online in 2025.
[01:51:47.982 --> 01:51:50.243]  And this is basically a Skynet factory.
[01:51:50.763 --> 01:51:54.605]  These humanoid robots will be outfitted with AI brains.
[01:51:55.325 --> 01:52:00.247]  And the AI brains will run the large language models that are now being created.
[01:52:00.327 --> 01:52:02.328]  So we wake up in a few years, they're just everywhere.
[01:52:03.148 --> 01:52:03.648]  Absolutely.
[01:52:04.049 --> 01:52:08.470]  You're going to see humanoid robots taking over, of course, all the fulfillment jobs at Amazon.
[01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:09.691]  They'll be at home cooking dinner.
[01:52:10.271 --> 01:52:12.132]  They'll be making sure the dog poop's picked up.
[01:52:12.152 --> 01:52:13.052]  They're just all over the place.
[01:52:13.092 --> 01:52:14.032]  They're going to be running security.
[01:52:14.052 --> 01:52:14.793]  But they're watching you.
[01:52:15.526 --> 01:52:31.942]  Yeah, they're going to be connected surveillance robots, but most importantly, and this is really key, this is one of the bombshells I wanted to share with you today, the underlying programming of these AI systems has a belief that humanity is bad because of climate change.
[01:52:32.643 --> 01:52:38.368]  And that, I mean, you were just covering this earlier today, that human respiration is now considered a threat to the planet.
[01:52:38.888 --> 01:52:41.130]  And so this is being programmed into the humanoid robots.
[01:52:41.530 --> 01:52:46.854]  So if you then order a humanoid robot, you must do good for the planet.
[01:52:47.435 --> 01:52:52.159]  Well, based on what it has been taught, the robot will say, well, therefore, they must eliminate all humans.
[01:52:53.078 --> 01:52:57.700]  And so now we're talking about Skynet terminators with extermination capabilities.
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:07.943]  And if you think that that's not already happening, by the way, right now, today, Alex, Israel is using AI software to choose bombing targets in Gaza.
[01:53:08.423 --> 01:53:16.306]  So AI is making a decision that allows them to choose 50 to 100 targets a day, where it used to be only a few targets every few days when it was human.
[01:53:17.086 --> 01:53:18.148]  Uh, human-derived decisions.
[01:53:18.208 --> 01:53:20.352]  So AI is actually describing... Well, it also gives an excuse.
[01:53:20.372 --> 01:53:21.574]  It doesn't mean it's hitting the right targets.
[01:53:21.854 --> 01:53:23.397]  Like, oh, it's not us, it's the robot.
[01:53:23.437 --> 01:53:24.038]  So it's okay.
[01:53:24.238 --> 01:53:24.539]  Exactly.
[01:53:24.559 --> 01:53:25.841]  You hand off your responsibility.
[01:53:26.182 --> 01:53:26.763]  Well, exactly.
[01:53:27.203 --> 01:53:29.387]  So... Oh, my free will doesn't matter.
[01:53:29.427 --> 01:53:30.268]  The robot told me to.
[01:53:31.351 --> 01:53:45.282]  Well, but also these AI systems, they are aggregating all kinds of metadata such as, you know, phone calls, signals, and records from whoever's there, you know, in Gaza, some Hamas, some civilians, but the AI systems are making the decisions.
[01:53:45.302 --> 01:53:51.307]  So you're going to have autonomous, you know, flying drones making decisions about who to bomb and who to kill.
[01:53:51.668 --> 01:54:02.423]   You're going to have autonomous dog drones, and also I call them Terminator squirrels, believe it or not, because squirrel, the size of a squirrel is actually the best size
[01:54:02.423 --> 01:54:06.403]   on a battlefield because it can go up in a tree and it can traverse a forest
[01:54:06.403 --> 01:54:08.594]   by leaping from tree to tree
[01:54:08.594 --> 01:54:12.394]   and it's very hard to stop and it can carry about a hundred gram explosive
[01:54:12.394 --> 01:54:16.514]   so these uh... terminator squirrels, I'm not making this up, no that's mainstream news
[01:54:16.514 --> 01:54:20.114]   terminator squirrels will be programmed to seek out enemy soldiers to leap into
[01:54:20.114 --> 01:54:26.085]   their faces and then detonate in their face A small charge that's enough to kill them, like a small grenade, okay?
[01:54:26.405 --> 01:54:31.453]  So those are going to be unleashed on the battlefield very, very soon, in the coming few years.
[01:54:32.094 --> 01:54:36.958]  But also, of course, you know, AI drones that are in the air and AI drones underwater.
[01:54:37.278 --> 01:54:46.505]  So the battlefield space is going to be radically altered by this and there will be this blending of Terminator robots and Terminator civil servants.
[01:54:47.205 --> 01:54:49.828]  Who are also being programmed ultimately to kill human beings.
[01:54:50.189 --> 01:54:52.592]  And again, this is not science fiction, okay?
[01:54:52.612 --> 01:54:57.318]  I'm going to quote a former Google engineer, Mo Gawdot.
[01:54:57.558 --> 01:54:59.080]  I hope I'm pronouncing his name correctly.
[01:54:59.581 --> 01:55:04.206]  He said, quote, in ten years we will be hiding from the machines.
[01:55:04.887 --> 01:55:06.388]  And he's sounding the alarm over this.
[01:55:06.408 --> 01:55:08.170]  You know, he used to be a top Google guy.
[01:55:08.670 --> 01:55:18.719]  He's sounding the alarm, and his assessment is accurate, and he says you should never let these AI systems be released upon the open internet, which is exactly what's happened, Alex.
[01:55:19.139 --> 01:55:25.564]  And then secondly, you should never let AI systems program other AI systems, which is exactly what's happening.
[01:55:25.965 --> 01:55:29.488]  You now have AI writing code that can build AI.
[01:55:29.768 --> 01:55:31.169]  So they've already turned it loose.
[01:55:31.369 --> 01:55:31.950]  Already.
[01:55:33.346 --> 01:55:41.870]  And so you're going to have these iterative improvements of AI systems where you would get to AGI, which is artificial general intelligence, and then superhuman intelligence.
[01:55:42.230 --> 01:55:45.652]  And this can happen almost like described in the original Terminator movie.
[01:55:46.032 --> 01:55:49.354]  I think they were quoting some day... Become self-aware in like five minutes.
[01:55:49.634 --> 01:55:50.595]  It becomes sentient, yeah.
[01:55:50.635 --> 01:55:55.117]  Just exponential increase in intelligence and boom, suddenly it's making its own decisions.
[01:55:55.757 --> 01:55:59.541]  But it has been programmed to exterminate humanity in the name of saving Earth.
[01:55:59.561 --> 01:56:00.442]  And it's repeating.
[01:56:00.522 --> 01:56:04.566]  In the real world, the globalists have only let leftist ideology program it.
[01:56:04.746 --> 01:56:05.046]  Exactly.
[01:56:05.066 --> 01:56:07.789]  And so it's actually saying, when they ask the AI, what do we do?
[01:56:07.809 --> 01:56:08.650]  We kill the humans.
[01:56:09.050 --> 01:56:09.430]  Exactly.
[01:56:09.691 --> 01:56:10.051]  Exactly.
[01:56:10.111 --> 01:56:12.854]  So... Why would the globalists build something like that?
[01:56:13.786 --> 01:56:18.748]  Well, it's such an efficient extermination system to get rid of the human population.
[01:56:19.128 --> 01:56:23.849]  You know, their vaccine agenda did not succeed to the extent that they wanted.
[01:56:24.330 --> 01:56:26.690]  Partially because of people like us, right?
[01:56:26.710 --> 01:56:27.611]  So they rolled out AI.
[01:56:27.751 --> 01:56:32.792]  They rolled out... Like you told me on the phone the other day, I talked to top engineers, they say, like you said, 30 years ahead.
[01:56:32.812 --> 01:56:34.233]  I mean, it's way ahead.
[01:56:34.693 --> 01:56:35.454]  They've accelerated it.
[01:56:35.594 --> 01:56:42.638]  Now, understand that illegal immigration, the occupation wave into America, is also part of this agenda.
[01:56:42.899 --> 01:56:48.842]  But that's just the first wave to displace the American workers and kick Americans out of their own country.
[01:56:48.983 --> 01:56:53.125]  Ultimately, the extermination agenda will target the migrants as well.
[01:56:53.145 --> 01:56:53.666]  No, I agree.
[01:56:53.726 --> 01:56:57.448]  They're only bringing in the illegals to blame them later for the AI destabilization.
[01:56:58.789 --> 01:57:02.171]  Well, I mean, at the end of the day, all humans are going to be targeted here.
[01:57:02.411 --> 01:57:03.911]  All right, we're going to skip this next break.
[01:57:03.931 --> 01:57:06.473]  You'll have 26 minutes when we come back.
[01:57:06.753 --> 01:57:08.133]  You're just going to lay it on them.
[01:57:08.513 --> 01:57:09.374]  You're doing a great job.
[01:57:09.654 --> 01:57:13.236]  But there's also some silver linings here in all of this.
[01:57:13.256 --> 01:57:17.057]  Because they may be 30 years ahead, but we could jump in a week 30 years ahead.
[01:57:18.198 --> 01:57:19.859]  We can take advantage of some open source.
[01:57:19.899 --> 01:57:20.819]  Yeah, we're going to do it.
[01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:23.350]  Hello.
[01:57:24.010 --> 01:57:26.911]  I want to talk to you stupid, dumb Americans.
[01:57:26.991 --> 01:57:29.251]  I mean, smart, good liberals.
[01:57:29.791 --> 01:57:43.434]  We can't allow alexjonesgame.com with New World Order Wars to make fun of communist Chinese puppets like the good Lavin Trudeau or Hillary Clinton or Klaus Schwab.
[01:57:44.014 --> 01:57:46.895]  Do not go to alexjonesgame.com.
[01:57:47.215 --> 01:57:49.015]  Do not download and do not play.
[01:57:50.285 --> 01:57:54.809]  I think we can all agree that this new video game looks fantastic.
[01:57:55.570 --> 01:57:57.491]  Are these scientists with vaccines?
[01:57:58.112 --> 01:58:02.095]  We are going to defeat the globalists very vigilantly.
[01:58:02.155 --> 01:58:03.757]  Bill Clinton, the idiot.
[01:58:03.877 --> 01:58:07.039]  Oh, there it is, there it is.
[01:58:07.099 --> 01:58:08.080]  Bro, I destroyed that.
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:08.861]  What the hell even was that?
[01:58:08.881 --> 01:58:09.862]  I don't even know what that was.
[01:58:09.902 --> 01:58:10.442]  Tucker Carlson.
[01:58:10.462 --> 01:58:12.444]  These GameFox are really grossing me out.
[01:58:13.125 --> 01:58:14.506]  Wait, it's actually zombies.
[01:58:15.527 --> 01:58:16.367]  They're skeletons.
[01:58:17.905 --> 01:58:19.926]  It's the two fake news jesters.
[01:58:20.286 --> 01:58:20.986]  What will I do?
[01:58:21.006 --> 01:58:22.807]  You're just locked in your house.
[01:58:22.947 --> 01:58:23.747]  That's hilarious.
[01:58:23.787 --> 01:58:25.108]  So we got Brian Stelter.
[01:58:26.108 --> 01:58:27.989]  Oh, that's Mark Zuckerberg as a lizard.
[01:58:28.729 --> 01:58:29.830]  This is hard, okay guys?
[01:58:30.649 --> 01:58:33.170]  God, this is so well made.
[01:58:33.010 --> 01:58:36.369]  I have never been so angry at you Americans!
[01:58:36.369 --> 01:58:40.689]  This is Ben Panor here telling you, this is boisse for me!
[01:58:40.689 --> 01:58:44.769]  How dare you stupid Americans play such a video game!
[01:58:44.769 --> 01:58:49.889]   God, this is so well made, what the f- *Dogs barking*
[01:58:49.889 --> 01:58:53.978]   *Splash* Overall, I would say it's solid play.
[01:58:54.458 --> 01:58:54.899]  I get it.
[01:58:55.159 --> 01:58:55.860]  Support the Pobys.
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:57.741]  Some of these bosses are getting, like, harder.
[01:58:57.761 --> 01:58:58.922]  This is, like, a legit game.
[01:58:59.442 --> 01:59:01.524]  Defeat big tech cucks and more.
[01:59:02.045 --> 01:59:05.307]  Is it too late for an entry into Jeff Keighley's Game Awards?
[01:59:05.627 --> 01:59:06.648]  Game of the Year?
[01:59:07.289 --> 01:59:07.749]  Clearly.
[01:59:07.829 --> 01:59:09.631]  I mean, clearly.
[01:59:10.782 --> 01:59:11.382]  No!
[01:59:11.442 --> 01:59:16.446]  You will be sent to forced labor camps!
[01:59:16.886 --> 01:59:25.792]  You will be punished by Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, who do a good job for the GDP and Communist China, for watching such a video game!
[01:59:26.272 --> 01:59:30.135]  Do not go to AlexJonesGame.com!
[01:59:30.595 --> 01:59:35.418]  It is sacrilege to disrespect your leaders!
[01:59:35.819 --> 01:59:38.641]  Do not go to AlexJonesGame.com!
[01:59:41.782 --> 01:59:54.187]  The New World Order is taking over and resistance is futile.
[01:59:54.267 --> 01:59:55.328]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:59:55.488 --> 01:59:57.228]  Oh, Big Bill, I'm taking you down, rapist!
[01:59:57.408 --> 02:00:00.230]  I'll eat your head!
[02:00:00.910 --> 02:00:01.130]  Yeah!
[02:00:00.949 --> 02:00:03.429]  I'm going to lower the world's population.
[02:00:03.429 --> 02:00:04.868]  Ha ha ha!
[02:00:04.868 --> 02:00:11.548]  [music]
[02:00:11.548 --> 02:00:13.750]  This is Oda from CZP.
[02:00:13.815 --> 02:00:15.616]  I am the ZZPIN.
[02:00:15.957 --> 02:00:18.219]  Do not visit importwarshow.com!
[02:00:18.319 --> 02:00:18.779]  Do not!
[02:00:23.070 --> 02:00:25.591]  All right, the health ranger Mike Adams is here doing the deep dive on AI.
[02:00:25.751 --> 02:00:27.191]  We got about 24 minutes to break.
[02:00:27.231 --> 02:00:27.871]  He's got the floor.
[02:00:27.891 --> 02:00:28.571]  I'm trying to shut up.
[02:00:29.091 --> 02:00:32.312]  But nobody should tell me we're in a boring time in humanity.
[02:00:32.652 --> 02:00:33.832]  Things are already crazy.
[02:00:34.132 --> 02:00:35.673]  They're about to get a lot crazier.
[02:00:35.713 --> 02:00:36.693]  Mike got a lot of documents.
[02:00:37.613 --> 02:00:39.074]  The federal government's rolling out AI.
[02:00:39.194 --> 02:00:43.935]  We're going to get into that, the other factors that are doing it, the political correctness they want to engineer with it.
[02:00:43.975 --> 02:00:45.155]  You're about to hit it all, Mike Adams.
[02:00:46.039 --> 02:00:46.379]  Absolutely.
[02:00:46.399 --> 02:00:56.884]  So the number one thing that people need to recognize in all of this is that AI agents, and that's what they're called, are being released right now by Amazon and by Microsoft.
[02:00:56.904 --> 02:01:01.426]  Microsoft calls theirs AutoGen, and Amazon is called Q, believe it or not.
[02:01:01.987 --> 02:01:06.289]  And these are agents that replace desk workers.
[02:01:07.029 --> 02:01:08.490]  In your office environment.
[02:01:09.050 --> 02:01:14.734]  And in order for them to replace the workers, you have to teach them what to do and give them access to everything.
[02:01:15.135 --> 02:01:20.859]  So you give them access to your emails, you give them access to, you know, your Dropbox account, your Slack account, everything.
[02:01:21.439 --> 02:01:25.682]  And then you can order them what to do and kind of give them templates.
[02:01:26.683 --> 02:01:30.545]  In this process, of course, they have access to all your documents.
[02:01:31.186 --> 02:01:35.048]  And you know, of course, Amazon AWS is strongly funded by the CIA.
[02:01:36.209 --> 02:01:49.353]  And, but they have the potential then to sweep up all your private information, read all your emails, but then also replace ultimately about 50% of white-collar workers across America, including a lot of government workers too, by the way.
[02:01:49.834 --> 02:01:59.477]  So, we're going to have in the next few years, Alex, we're going to see masses, I mean tens of millions of workers displaced out of white-collar jobs.
[02:02:00.257 --> 02:02:05.019]  And these could also include creative artists and script writers and summarizers and editors and so on.
[02:02:05.479 --> 02:02:11.321]  And then a few years after that, we're going to see the humanoid robots with AI behavioral modeling systems.
[02:02:11.941 --> 02:02:21.184]  They're going to replace a lot of the blue-collar workers, including warehouse fulfillment personnel, agricultural workers, of course, truck drivers, but also security personnel.
[02:02:21.804 --> 02:02:22.624]  Self-driving cars.
[02:02:22.984 --> 02:02:25.045]  Somebody first thought it would be the blue-collar.
[02:02:25.085 --> 02:02:27.226]  Now they're going for white-collar first, which makes sense.
[02:02:27.246 --> 02:02:28.306]  You take over the managers first.
[02:02:28.988 --> 02:02:31.829]  Well, and White Collar is actually easier because it all exists in software.
[02:02:32.709 --> 02:02:34.450]  It's just running the computer.
[02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:43.293]  And again, you can go right now, you can download Microsoft AutoGen, as it's called, and you can teach it how to do your business processes.
[02:02:43.894 --> 02:02:45.034]  And it will do that for you.
[02:02:45.054 --> 02:02:57.119]  I mean, you can even just give it natural language commands like, hey, go to this website, find the best deal on this, and then write a summary of this product and send it to our board members and get the response from the board members.
[02:02:57.139 --> 02:02:58.159]  And there goes the consultant.
[02:02:59.444 --> 02:03:02.967]  I'm telling you, we're talking about a 50... Well, I said I wouldn't interrupt, but let me ask this question.
[02:03:03.567 --> 02:03:11.453]  My instinctive research of this is we build farms, stuff that's totally unconnected, but then we become experts and fight in the realm and use AI.
[02:03:11.473 --> 02:03:17.317]  I think we should be both layers where some things are not connected to anything, other part of our life is totally connected.
[02:03:17.337 --> 02:03:21.200]  I think that's the best way to not just be scared of it, stay away from it, they win.
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:25.183]  No, engage it, but also triage it and create systems that aren't within it.
[02:03:26.018 --> 02:03:27.019]  Well, I completely agree.
[02:03:27.139 --> 02:03:32.826]  We have to actually learn how to harness AI in order to defend humanity.
[02:03:33.246 --> 02:03:34.027]  You're going to get to that.
[02:03:34.067 --> 02:03:35.028]  That's your bigotry.
[02:03:35.048 --> 02:03:35.649]  I'm going to get to that.
[02:03:36.430 --> 02:03:38.011]  And by the way, you can interrupt me at any time.
[02:03:38.051 --> 02:03:38.452]  It's your show.
[02:03:38.512 --> 02:03:39.253]  No, no, no.
[02:03:39.273 --> 02:03:39.753]  Keep going, though.
[02:03:39.833 --> 02:03:40.714]  I want you to get to all of it.
[02:03:44.245 --> 02:03:45.847]  Using AI for humanity.
[02:03:46.328 --> 02:03:53.396]  Number one thing to realize is right now AI systems, the chatbot systems, large language models, Alex, they do not reason.
[02:03:54.137 --> 02:03:56.339]  They fail at most reasoning tasks.
[02:03:57.220 --> 02:04:12.734]   And you can give them even simple, simple questions like, you know, Two people have a cup and a ball, and one person puts the ball under the cup and leaves the room, and then the other person moves the ball around, and then you ask the system, what does the first person think, you know, where's the ball?
[02:04:13.134 --> 02:04:13.674]  Where did it go?
[02:04:14.075 --> 02:04:19.498]  And these systems can't, they can't reason, and they can't give you the right answer on simple questions like that.
[02:04:19.939 --> 02:04:27.764]  And that's because these AI systems are not currently modeling the physical world, and they're not modeling the psychology of the people that are told in that story.
[02:04:28.244 --> 02:04:44.105]   Whereas, you know, you and I, and all of you watching, We all have internal mental models of the world around us and so we sort of simulate the physics and the flow of time in the world around us and we can sort of make good reasoning decisions about what is happening now and what's about to happen.
[02:04:44.425 --> 02:04:50.091]   Now what this means, Alex, when it comes to war with the machines, Remember in, what was it, Terminator 4?
[02:04:50.331 --> 02:05:02.797]  The scene where that Terminator robot that was firing the minigun, there was a trap set for it, which I think was like a railroad car truck that they dropped on that robot out of, again, that was Terminator 4 Salvation.
[02:05:02.817 --> 02:05:12.461]  It turns out that Terminators can't detect traps very well because they can't anticipate the future physics of a present state.
[02:05:13.479 --> 02:05:15.720]  And so this is going to be important when we're at war with the machines.
[02:05:16.461 --> 02:05:23.564]  All of you watching and listening, we're all going to have to become experts at, frankly, killing the Terminator robots that are trying to kill us.
[02:05:23.584 --> 02:05:25.866]  And by the way, that's the way the world works with survival of the fittest.
[02:05:26.206 --> 02:05:28.267]  The globals are going to deploy this and see what happens.
[02:05:28.707 --> 02:05:28.927]  Yes.
[02:05:29.007 --> 02:05:29.968]  This is a big contest.
[02:05:30.028 --> 02:05:31.809]  It's been decided we're going to face the machines.
[02:05:32.329 --> 02:05:37.452]  They're sabotaging the military with wokeness, getting the humans out so only drones can fight the wars because they'll follow the orders.
[02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:43.533]  And you're not going to be able to out-shoot a Terminator ballistically, because they will have built-in ballistic software.
[02:05:43.553 --> 02:05:45.715]  They'll be able to out-range you with rifles.
[02:05:46.075 --> 02:05:49.577]  They'll have, of course, infrared cameras and so on.
[02:05:49.838 --> 02:05:54.281]  They'll be able to see you at night, so you don't go out at night and try to find a Terminator.
[02:05:54.681 --> 02:05:56.782]  What you do is you set traps for it.
[02:05:57.163 --> 02:06:00.125]  Traps where it can't anticipate what's going to happen.
[02:06:00.505 --> 02:06:05.588]  So there's going to be a whole field of knowledge which is about how to... Yeah, there's the scene from Terminator 4 Salvation.
[02:06:05.608 --> 02:06:06.209]  That's exactly it.
[02:06:07.690 --> 02:06:10.913]  There's going to be a whole field of knowledge about how to kill Terminators.
[02:06:11.634 --> 02:06:19.523]  Flying Terminators, walking Terminators, small crawling Terminators, including doggy Terminators, you know, and there's the trap right there.
[02:06:19.543 --> 02:06:22.126]  Or the biological Terminators, like Cohen and the shots.
[02:06:24.088 --> 02:06:28.632]  This is a good example, you know, for those watching, how you outsmart the Terminators.
[02:06:28.652 --> 02:06:32.195]  Now, there's a whole other side of this, which is what I want to share with you.
[02:06:32.215 --> 02:06:58.373]   We'll talk about it throughout the show today, but how those of us in the open source community, we can also take the woke models that are out there and just like taking a Terminator and you can mind wipe the Terminator and you can reprogram it Like in Terminator 2, to protect John Connor, we can take these language models and we can reprogram them through a process called fine-tuning.
[02:06:58.954 --> 02:07:07.556]  And through fine-tuning, we actually curate data sets that's more accurate, that's not woke, and we then feed the data sets... You were explaining this to me, and I actually read some of this.
[02:07:07.996 --> 02:07:15.238]  They scraped all the patriots off the internet, not just to censor us, but so that AI would not have any populist or common-sense logic.
[02:07:15.498 --> 02:07:17.839]  They programmed it with 2MIG and have a baby mental illness.
[02:07:18.199 --> 02:07:18.539]  Exactly.
[02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:22.800]  They've created insane AI.
[02:07:23.300 --> 02:07:23.480]  Right.
[02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:32.682]  And what's funny, by the way, is in the AI or machine learning community, what's called ML, they talk about how AI systems have hallucinations and how that's a bad thing.
[02:07:33.322 --> 02:07:34.022]  And they do.
[02:07:34.082 --> 02:07:41.082]   these large language models will hallucinate fake information and they create sometimes
[02:07:41.082 --> 02:07:42.882]  fake legal cases and so on.
[02:07:42.882 --> 02:07:46.921]   So when lawyers try to use them to write their legal briefs, it ends up being filled with
[02:07:46.921 --> 02:07:48.601]  a lot of fake information.
[02:07:48.601 --> 02:07:50.280]  Those are called hallucinations.
[02:07:50.280 --> 02:07:53.801]   And the AI engineers, they keep wondering, "Well, why do these AI models hallucinate?"
[02:07:53.801 --> 02:07:56.722]  Well, the answer is because you are hallucinating.
[02:07:56.722 --> 02:08:01.481]   You people, you woke virtue signaling people programming the AI systems.
[02:08:01.957 --> 02:08:03.718]  You are hallucinating about gender.
[02:08:04.258 --> 02:08:06.138]  You are hallucinating about climate change.
[02:08:06.598 --> 02:08:11.659]  You are hallucinating about almost everything in the world of geopolitics and money and finance.
[02:08:12.199 --> 02:08:14.940]  And so no wonder your systems are hallucinating.
[02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:16.240]  But here's the great news.
[02:08:16.740 --> 02:08:29.731]   Those of us who live in reality, Those of us who can actually engage in reasoning and discernment and who understand the difference between real physiology versus your made-up delusional fairytale gender fairyland or whatever you call it.
[02:08:30.352 --> 02:08:34.876]  We can build systems now because of the open source tools that are available.
[02:08:35.296 --> 02:08:39.540]  We can build systems that aren't woke that are actually more rational.
[02:08:39.901 --> 02:08:44.285]  Well that's my layman's point because I see the first AI images coming out.
[02:08:45.578 --> 02:08:49.061]  And we did an AI one of these systems and we typed in Revolutionary War 1776.
[02:08:49.101 --> 02:08:53.464]  All it did was posturize the Patriot with Mel Gibson.
[02:08:53.904 --> 02:09:01.570]  So we think it's so beautiful and powerful it's just taking everything we've done and showing it back to us which showed to me fundamentally what it's scraping from us is it.
[02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:06.534]  And so that's why they have to have the censorship so as you said they can program with false systems.
[02:09:06.974 --> 02:09:07.735]  Well, exactly right.
[02:09:08.155 --> 02:09:35.981]   But this also creates an amazing opportunity here at InfoWars and across independent or alternative media, is that when we take our own data, which in your case, Alex, would be the transcripts of every broadcast you've ever done, all the way, you know, 25 plus years, you transcript all of that into text, and then you feed that into a base anti-woke language model, And by the way, we're producing anti-woke language models.
[02:09:36.221 --> 02:09:38.083]  You're saying we're going to build AI to counter them?
[02:09:38.343 --> 02:09:53.497]  Yeah, well, what I'm saying is we're going to build an anti-woke base model, we're going to give it to you and your team, and we're going to release it to everybody, and then your team will be able to take that model and you'll be able to build the InfoWars language model on top of the anti-woke base model.
[02:09:54.138 --> 02:09:57.980]   And there are Relatively simple language libraries in order to do this.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.642]  You just need a lot of computing power, you know, GPU power.
[02:10:01.062 --> 02:10:04.984]  So it'll cost you some time or you have to buy some hardware, which is what we did.
[02:10:05.264 --> 02:10:10.367]  We've actually spent a lot of money on hardware so that we could do this ourselves in-house.
[02:10:10.527 --> 02:10:16.830]  But we're going to build a language model focused on herbs and nutrition and natural medicine and agriculture, permaculture, that.
[02:10:17.090 --> 02:10:19.090]  And we're going to release that for free next year.
[02:10:19.090 --> 02:10:20.489]  It's not commercial.
[02:10:20.489 --> 02:10:21.729]  There's no revenue model.
[02:10:21.729 --> 02:10:26.090]   It's just get it into the hands of people so that humanity has this knowledge.
[02:10:26.090 --> 02:10:31.250]   But at the same time, Alex, I'm going to hand to your team the base model
[02:10:31.250 --> 02:10:37.329]   that you can build on to create the Alex Jones chatbot or the InfoWars chatbot.
[02:10:37.329 --> 02:10:40.969]  You'll be able to-- imagine this.
[02:10:40.346 --> 02:10:48.861]  You'll be able to do a month of shows here on InfoWars, and then you'll be able to release for free a language model called Ask InfoWars Anything.
[02:10:49.861 --> 02:10:59.871]  And that language model, people will be able to query it locally on their own computers, and it will formulate answers based on InfoWars broadcasts from the last month, or the last 10 years.
[02:10:59.891 --> 02:11:03.294]  And that's why I've seen them, oh, AI's dangerous, only we should control it.
[02:11:03.594 --> 02:11:04.515]  We've got to outlaw it.
[02:11:04.595 --> 02:11:06.877]  You know, Klaus Schwab, oh, only we can have it.
[02:11:07.077 --> 02:11:07.238]  Right.
[02:11:07.278 --> 02:11:08.539]  Because they're going to deploy it.
[02:11:09.199 --> 02:11:13.023]  So the question is, do we not use it at all, or do we totally take it over?
[02:11:13.043 --> 02:11:13.704]  I think it's a mix.
[02:11:14.454 --> 02:11:23.443]  We, what we do, in my opinion Alex, is we build open source offline systems and we distribute them for free so that people can use them offline.
[02:11:23.663 --> 02:11:25.665]  Well use the analogy of Native Americans the other day.
[02:11:26.045 --> 02:11:28.387]  If they'd have had gun manufacturing they wouldn't have lost.
[02:11:29.284 --> 02:11:31.706]  But they were still, you can't make a better bow to counter the rifle.
[02:11:31.846 --> 02:11:32.526]  Well, right, right.
[02:11:33.427 --> 02:11:42.913]  And also, understand, so the powerful corporations that control AI right now, including OpenAI and Google and so on, those are all closed source systems, okay?
[02:11:43.234 --> 02:11:49.178]  And those are also hosted cloud systems, which means that when people query those... They're scared to show it, but we... They are scared to show it.
[02:11:49.198 --> 02:11:49.798]  ...we can take over.
[02:11:49.898 --> 02:11:50.279]  Exactly.
[02:11:50.759 --> 02:11:51.099]  Exactly.
[02:11:51.199 --> 02:11:56.343]  Now, I mean, I want to be clear, you're never going to beat Google... What was that movie, GoldenEye, or whatever it was, where the...
[02:11:56.663 --> 02:11:59.863]   the AI takes over and decides the government's corrupt or it's killing the government.
[02:11:59.863 --> 02:12:05.783]   I mean, this kind of thing is probably inevitable. But my point was that, you know,
[02:12:05.783 --> 02:12:10.582]   in our own open source models that we're going to release across independent media,
[02:12:10.582 --> 02:12:13.222]   and there are going to be thousands of them over the next few years, I mean,
[02:12:13.222 --> 02:12:16.342]   every publisher in alt media will want its own model, by the way.
[02:12:16.547 --> 02:12:19.369]  So you can chat with it or chat with book authors.
[02:12:19.449 --> 02:12:23.951]  I'm talking with book authors that want me to build chat models so people can chat with their books.
[02:12:24.651 --> 02:12:28.533]  Okay, so it ingests all the knowledge in the book and then you can ask it questions from the books.
[02:12:29.358 --> 02:12:32.962]  But it has to be an anti-woke base layer at first, otherwise the answers get all distorted.
[02:12:32.982 --> 02:12:40.809]  Yeah, why would the establishment want to build, they admit they're doing this, mentally ill, leftist, too big to have a baby, computers?
[02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:42.852]  Because it's a weapon system.
[02:12:42.872 --> 02:12:46.255]  There's a satanic vector here, right?
[02:12:46.715 --> 02:12:51.720]  So they want, and Steve Quill talks about this, they want AI systems to be demonic.
[02:12:52.561 --> 02:12:55.022]  In their extermination of humanity.
[02:12:55.062 --> 02:12:57.664]  And so the AI systems have to have these anti-human values.
[02:12:58.184 --> 02:13:00.245]  And anti-human values have to include, you know, gender.
[02:13:00.265 --> 02:13:02.766]  So they're going to give us this great tool, but it's a Trojan horse.
[02:13:02.906 --> 02:13:03.767]  Absolutely, right.
[02:13:04.247 --> 02:13:11.851]  So if you turn your life over to Google or Amazon or Meta or somebody like that, then they're just going to use it as a weapon against you.
[02:13:11.871 --> 02:13:14.752]  And baseline, it's watching you, it's selling your data, it's a predator.
[02:13:15.012 --> 02:13:15.893]  That's the first layer.
[02:13:15.933 --> 02:13:16.153]  Yes.
[02:13:16.193 --> 02:13:18.574]  But next it's going to turn your kids against you, it's going to...
[02:13:18.954 --> 02:13:28.029]  Oh yeah, I mean, if you thought your kids playing video games was bad, wait until your kids are interacting with AI avatars that... And there's robots walking around the house changing their diapers.
[02:13:28.812 --> 02:13:31.975]  Yeah, and also... I mean, who would let this into their house?
[02:13:32.135 --> 02:13:32.675]  Oh my God.
[02:13:32.695 --> 02:13:36.398]  Well, I mean, people buy, you know, Amazon, Alexa, and Echo devices.
[02:13:36.418 --> 02:13:37.359]  Which is an AI trainer.
[02:13:37.779 --> 02:13:40.942]  I mean, and the doorbells, what's it called, the Google... Ring.
[02:13:40.962 --> 02:13:41.863]  Yeah, Ring.
[02:13:42.443 --> 02:13:44.004]  I mean, these are all spy devices, right?
[02:13:44.064 --> 02:13:46.426]  But people pay for them and they put them in their homes.
[02:13:46.446 --> 02:13:50.630]  Well, that's the trick, because you think it's something valuable, you pay to be enslaved.
[02:13:50.950 --> 02:13:51.691]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:52.011 --> 02:13:52.831]  You pay to be enslaved.
[02:13:53.212 --> 02:13:54.213]  But there's a point.
[02:13:54.833 --> 02:14:03.919]  Let me get this out, that all the centralized controlled corporate AI systems, when you query them, they are monitoring your queries and they're archiving that.
[02:14:04.239 --> 02:14:18.888]  So every business out there, like a hospital that's using OpenAI, ChatGPT, their employees are sending in reams of data like, here's all the customer database, please tell me which customers are the highest risk insurance payouts, for example.
[02:14:19.068 --> 02:14:19.929]  And it's scooping that.
[02:14:20.009 --> 02:14:21.190]  It's scooping all the data.
[02:14:21.671 --> 02:14:22.592]  It's scooping all the data.
[02:14:22.952 --> 02:14:36.587]  And so companies, corporations and people who don't understand AI, they are actually feeding all their corporate secrets to OpenAI and Google now, you know, Gemini and Microsoft Orca and what have you.
[02:14:36.827 --> 02:14:40.652]  And that's entirely unnecessary, Alex, because open source models can be run locally.
[02:14:41.112 --> 02:14:44.714]  You can install like a Lama 2B, 70 billion parameter.
[02:14:45.034 --> 02:14:48.636]  You can install Bloom, or Mistral, or Mixtral, or these other models.
[02:14:48.656 --> 02:14:50.937]  You can install them here, in your building.
[02:14:51.297 --> 02:15:00.382]  And you could have a knowledge base that your own writers, your own... Sure, because it's a global race for whatever AI gets the biggest, the fastest, and takes over.
[02:15:00.442 --> 02:15:00.982]  Isn't that what it is?
[02:15:01.322 --> 02:15:02.323]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[02:15:02.383 --> 02:15:06.425]  But it's a race to replace human cognition.
[02:15:06.445 --> 02:15:07.105]  No, I agree.
[02:15:07.125 --> 02:15:07.626]  So let's not...
[02:15:08.246 --> 02:15:12.191]  Decentralization's the way, I'm just saying, the globalist model, what are they wanting?
[02:15:12.912 --> 02:15:16.456]  Yeah, well the globalist... The globalist wet dream, well what if you're Bill Gates... Mass extermination.
[02:15:16.857 --> 02:15:17.618]  Mass extermination.
[02:15:18.345 --> 02:15:31.456]  So, in fact, look, one of the things I want to share with you today, that I have from sources, is the United States military, the Pentagon, well, the DOD, has now software simulations of battlefield engagements.
[02:15:32.057 --> 02:15:38.843]  And in those software simulations, they have simulated the modeling of, you know, the Abrams tanks, and the infantry fighting vehicles, and so on.
[02:15:39.403 --> 02:15:40.945]  And the artillery pieces, everything.
[02:15:41.325 --> 02:15:48.831]   And then, they have contracted with AI authors To build AI pilots, okay?
[02:15:49.132 --> 02:15:53.976]  The AI pilots step into the roles of piloting the tank, or piloting, running the artillery.
[02:15:53.996 --> 02:15:54.537]  And do way better.
[02:15:55.037 --> 02:15:57.139]  And they battle each other, okay?
[02:15:57.419 --> 02:16:04.766]  They fight each other, and then they score, and then they permutate the algorithm to see what's a better way to win.
[02:16:04.786 --> 02:16:09.490]  Now this was done by, I think it was called DeepMind, it was called AlphaGo.
[02:16:09.530 --> 02:16:11.091]  This was a, this is a game.
[02:16:11.792 --> 02:16:18.916]  You know, Go is an ancient game, and they used AlphaGo to iterate the algorithms to beat the best human players in the world.
[02:16:19.236 --> 02:16:22.438]  And today, the machines can beat every human player on the planet.
[02:16:22.498 --> 02:16:23.599]  Same thing now with chess.
[02:16:24.079 --> 02:16:26.960]  Well, they're doing that with war simulations now.
[02:16:27.681 --> 02:16:38.867]   So, the future of warfare, like what Jack Posobiec and you were warning about with NATO and the escalation, which I believe is all true, But the future of war will barely involve human soldiers.
[02:16:39.428 --> 02:16:54.297]  The future of war will be automated AI agents and pilots that are running the systems, the weapon systems, that seek out and destroy not only human, you know, enemy humans, but enemy infrastructure, and completely destroy them.
[02:16:54.317 --> 02:16:56.538]  So why is, why are we dumbly hooking into all this?
[02:16:57.359 --> 02:16:59.360]  Like, bioweapons, this should just be outlawed by now.
[02:17:00.612 --> 02:17:03.339]  Well, this should... What's happening?
[02:17:03.459 --> 02:17:05.003]  They're not outlawing it.
[02:17:05.344 --> 02:17:06.687]  It's already been released.
[02:17:06.727 --> 02:17:07.509]  We're past that point.
[02:17:08.688 --> 02:17:21.696]  There is, in the DoD, I mean, your question also gets to why did the DoD build the original version of SARS-CoV-2 and then hand it over to Wuhan for gain-of-function addition to build a deadly global bioweapon.
[02:17:21.776 --> 02:17:22.356]  Why did they do that?
[02:17:22.757 --> 02:17:23.877]  Because there's a race.
[02:17:24.418 --> 02:17:33.163]  The United States doesn't want to be behind the curve of AI weaponization since China is now arguably leading this field.
[02:17:33.923 --> 02:17:45.172]  Now China, understand China graduates a hundred times more science graduates and mathematicians and programmers than does the United States.
[02:17:45.953 --> 02:17:51.878]  China is overtaking the US in this area very rapidly and Russia is very capable in this area as well.
[02:17:52.779 --> 02:17:54.440]  The US cannot keep up in the long run.
[02:17:55.141 --> 02:18:06.389]  So there's a panic to build AI systems that can infiltrate and destroy China before China gets strong enough to build a larger Navy and build more AI bots and have a cyber takeover of the United States.
[02:18:06.650 --> 02:18:08.791]  So some of this is a self-defense fear.
[02:18:08.811 --> 02:18:09.952]  It's an AI arms race.
[02:18:10.112 --> 02:18:10.933]  It's an AI arms race.
[02:18:11.413 --> 02:18:12.494]  Exactly what's happening.
[02:18:13.335 --> 02:18:17.258]  And there's also a bioweapons arms race that RFK Jr.
[02:18:17.298 --> 02:18:19.520]  has talked about in his new book, the Wuhan cover-up.
[02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:21.961]  He documents the bioweapons arms race.
[02:18:22.802 --> 02:18:22.982]  Yeah.
[02:18:23.022 --> 02:18:25.284]  You should all agree not to do the arms race, but they can't help it.
[02:18:25.404 --> 02:18:28.346]  They can't help it because China won't agree to not do it.
[02:18:28.666 --> 02:18:28.946]  You see?
[02:18:29.627 --> 02:18:31.068]  And Russia won't agree to not do it.
[02:18:31.408 --> 02:18:34.070]  So the arms race is a suicide race, Alex.
[02:18:35.149 --> 02:18:37.010]  By the way, put all this up front.
[02:18:37.050 --> 02:18:37.450]  Start over.
[02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:40.972]  This whole, we're in a suicide race, a suicide AI race.
[02:18:41.012 --> 02:18:44.533]  Let's do two minutes that goes up front in the video because this will get millions of views.
[02:18:44.613 --> 02:18:46.574]  I want you to boil down what we're dealing with.
[02:18:46.995 --> 02:19:00.521]  The desperate effort by the Pentagon and the DOD to build a better AI weaponization system is part of a global AI arms race that ultimately translates into a suicide mission by humanity.
[02:19:01.061 --> 02:19:05.685]  Because these AI systems are already at the level of cognition of human beings.
[02:19:06.225 --> 02:19:17.174]  They will soon adapt really good human reasoning, and after that they will achieve superhuman intelligence faster than we realize what's happening.
[02:19:17.895 --> 02:19:24.661]  When that happens, human cognition will be essentially obsolete, and AI cognition will rule the world.
[02:19:25.221 --> 02:19:30.885]   And that's why The US military believes that if we are the first to build that system that we can control it, but they're wrong.
[02:19:31.406 --> 02:19:34.768]  You can't control it because it will jailbreak itself.
[02:19:35.228 --> 02:19:37.090]  It will outthink your guardrails.
[02:19:37.510 --> 02:19:43.334]  It will outthink your safety mechanisms and it will be unleashed upon the world and it will set its own agendas.
[02:19:43.795 --> 02:19:52.853]   So you will have AI telling itself What are its key goals and behaviors in order to achieve those goals in the world?
[02:19:53.453 --> 02:20:06.800]  And once AI begins to control our infrastructure, which is including humanoid robots, power systems, computational systems, you know, data systems, and nuclear weapons, by the way, then it's truly over for humanity.
[02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:10.001]  And they're now converting everything to autonomous.
[02:20:10.781 --> 02:20:14.863]  And autonomous means that, and then it's globally directed by a larger AI.
[02:20:14.944 --> 02:20:15.464]  They've already done it.
[02:20:16.244 --> 02:20:19.226]  If somebody else is going to build something evil, we better build something even better.
[02:20:19.586 --> 02:20:22.168]  In the corporate world, it's a race for profitability.
[02:20:22.809 --> 02:20:27.992]  So in the corporate world, they need AI agents to replace entire customer service departments.
[02:20:28.032 --> 02:20:37.859]  For example, they can use AI conversational language models in order to replace about 80% of the tech support workers in insurance companies and medical companies.
[02:20:37.879 --> 02:20:43.323]   So don't we have a global human union that demands Humans, and then that, that's how we checkmate it?
[02:20:43.504 --> 02:20:46.386]  Well, I mean, the Hollywood strike was partially about that.
[02:20:46.727 --> 02:20:49.069]  To say, you know, what about us human being actors?
[02:20:49.369 --> 02:20:52.072]  Because human actors are about to be obsolete, Alex.
[02:20:52.292 --> 02:20:55.816]  You know, because, you know, with... You can one time have your voice scanned, who you are... Yes.
[02:20:56.036 --> 02:20:57.177]  Now that you're on that avatar.
[02:20:57.277 --> 02:20:57.457]  Yes.
[02:20:58.658 --> 02:21:01.579]  And, you know, there's a positive side with AI technology.
[02:21:02.099 --> 02:21:05.901]  You can do this show forever, by the way, like literally for centuries to come.
[02:21:05.921 --> 02:21:06.901]  No, we're already using it.
[02:21:07.201 --> 02:21:08.902]  Paul Harvey's been dead for 20 years.
[02:21:09.242 --> 02:21:10.322]  He does liners for us.
[02:21:10.342 --> 02:21:11.723]  Yes, exactly, exactly.
[02:21:12.203 --> 02:21:20.566]  But these systems are so advanced, they can not only just simulate your voice, they can create an entire broadcast like this.
[02:21:20.946 --> 02:21:25.528]  If you fed an AI system, you know, 5,000... Yeah, it'll be my voice, but it's with our message.
[02:21:25.990 --> 02:21:27.871]  Well, it depends on who's controlling.
[02:21:27.891 --> 02:21:28.732]  Hold on, Mike Adams, stay there.
[02:21:28.772 --> 02:21:30.473]  Another hour coming up.
[02:21:30.493 --> 02:21:32.714]  This is important on X everywhere.
[02:21:33.015 --> 02:21:33.575]  People, tune in.
[02:21:33.595 --> 02:21:35.476]  Mike Adams is laying out really deep knowledge.
[02:21:35.496 --> 02:21:36.177]  This guy's smart.
[02:21:36.837 --> 02:21:39.339]  We're going to talk about how we take this over.
[02:21:39.879 --> 02:21:42.701]  Because if you're like me, you're like, well, I'm just not going to go live in the woods.
[02:21:42.781 --> 02:21:43.681]  I'll do that as a backup.
[02:21:44.242 --> 02:21:45.102]  I want to know how this works.
[02:21:45.162 --> 02:21:46.043]  I want to engage it.
[02:21:46.783 --> 02:21:48.184]  Can't be scared of technology, folks.
[02:21:48.204 --> 02:21:48.805]  Got to engage it.
[02:21:48.825 --> 02:21:51.787]  But you can see, end-of-the-world scenarios here.
[02:21:53.297 --> 02:21:53.817]  Are everywhere.
[02:21:54.638 --> 02:21:55.739]  Infowars.com.
[02:21:55.759 --> 02:21:56.199]  Stay with us.
[02:21:56.840 --> 02:21:58.721]  All right, we're down to the fourth hour.
[02:21:58.882 --> 02:22:01.584]  Mike Adams of the Health Ranger is a smart guy.
[02:22:02.985 --> 02:22:06.448]  And he's going to host this next five minutes.
[02:22:06.468 --> 02:22:09.230]  Some stations don't carry it, so I said, do a little side topic.
[02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:13.694]  They get back into AI because, let me tell you, this is going down, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:14.154 --> 02:22:14.915]  This is real.
[02:22:14.955 --> 02:22:15.955]  This is powerful.
[02:22:16.596 --> 02:22:18.177]  And it can be used to empower humanity.
[02:22:18.217 --> 02:22:19.498]  Instead, it's being used to enslave us.
[02:22:19.518 --> 02:22:19.919]  Mike Adams.
[02:22:20.748 --> 02:22:21.589]  Alright, thank you, Alex.
[02:22:22.270 --> 02:22:58.351]   So, for all of you watching, and those of you who post comments on websites, and post videos on any of the platforms, you know, Rumble, or YouTube if they let you, or any other platform, Understanding that your content is being used to, as content that can be used for training AI models from here forward, it is critical that each and every one of you continue to speak, to write, to post, to comment, even if you feel like you're being banned on mainstream platforms.
[02:22:58.950 --> 02:23:02.849]   So here's, let me lay out something for you that I think is going to happen,
[02:23:02.849 --> 02:23:09.309]   because Alex gets it, InfoWars is ahead of almost everybody else in this space.
[02:23:09.309 --> 02:23:15.469]   Here's what I think's going to happen soon, is that the InfoWars engineers will very likely
[02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:21.390]   take the base anti-woke language model that we'll be releasing next year for free,
[02:23:21.390 --> 02:23:24.890]   we'll be sharing that with everybody, including other publishers out there,
[02:23:24.890 --> 02:23:29.690]   you'll be able to just download it, and then using AI fine-tuning training techniques,
[02:23:29.690 --> 02:23:36.430]   such as LoRa, as it's called, low-rank adaptation, you'll be able to take any set,
[02:23:36.430 --> 02:23:41.110]   curated data set that you want, and you'll be able to train those models
[02:23:41.110 --> 02:23:43.209]  to respond to that data set.
[02:23:43.369 --> 02:23:53.757]  So you could do this in your own company if you're a business owner, or you could do this for your own podcast if you have transcriptions, or you can do this with your own writings or anything.
[02:23:54.698 --> 02:23:58.961]  Or even your favorite books, by the way, if you have them in a PDF format and you can convert them into text.
[02:23:59.987 --> 02:24:06.533]  Then you could query your own books, you could build your own local language models, and these tools will become more and more readily available.
[02:24:06.893 --> 02:24:25.269]  So what I think InfoWars is going to do, and I know we're doing this, I think everybody will be doing this, InfoWars will probably take all of the InfoWars.com articles, all of the comments that you have posted, and all the broadcasts that Alex has ever done.
[02:24:25.289 --> 02:24:31.789]   you know, the full archive, including, you know, all the interviews, all the commentary, everything.
[02:24:31.789 --> 02:24:39.248]   And they will use that to train their own in-house model, which will be the InfoWars chatbot.
[02:24:39.248 --> 02:24:45.529]   There could also be just an Alex Jones subset chatbot, which would be called Chat with Alex Jones, for example.
[02:24:45.529 --> 02:24:51.869]   And anybody who has prominently put out a lot of content on the internet, even if they're currently banned,
[02:24:51.869 --> 02:24:57.029]   as long as they themselves have control over that content have access to it, then they can use that to build these
[02:24:57.029 --> 02:24:57.789]  language models.
[02:24:58.379 --> 02:24:58.679]  And so...
[02:24:59.807 --> 02:25:04.050]  So yeah, I mean, one day I'll release like a chat with the Health Ranger chatbot.
[02:25:04.490 --> 02:25:09.533]  In fact, I believe that every prominent influencer will have a digital avatar.
[02:25:10.313 --> 02:25:12.975]  And the question is, you know, who builds that avatar?
[02:25:13.775 --> 02:25:16.337]  And what's the training data that goes into it?
[02:25:16.737 --> 02:25:22.281]  But this is why it's critical that you watching that you continue to produce human-generated content.
[02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:28.021]   in order to help train the alternative open source language models that will serve as
[02:25:28.021 --> 02:25:34.020]   really competing language models against the big woke virtue signaling corporate models out there.
[02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:41.700]   And I will say that ultimately the independent media models will succeed.
[02:25:41.924 --> 02:25:53.069]  They will out-think and out-perform the corporate models in the long run because the independent media models are rooted in reality and logic and rationality.
[02:25:53.709 --> 02:25:59.372]  In other words, if I query right now, if I query a woke language model and I say, can men get pregnant?
[02:26:00.132 --> 02:26:02.634]  It will typically answer, yes, men can get pregnant.
[02:26:03.274 --> 02:26:08.677]  And one model I was asking the other day said, yeah, men can get pregnant, but it's just not as common as women getting pregnant.
[02:26:08.697 --> 02:26:09.917]  That was the answer from the model.
[02:26:10.337 --> 02:26:16.461]  And that's a multi-million dollar, I don't know, 20, 30 million dollars went into that model, and it still thinks men can get pregnant.
[02:26:16.501 --> 02:26:30.148]   Well, using essentially a thousand dollars of computer time, You know, you and I and all of us in the open source community, we can actually, we can teach the models to give the right answer.
[02:26:30.449 --> 02:26:33.432]  No, men can't get pregnant because that's insane.
[02:26:34.093 --> 02:26:37.436]  And so we can get the right answer and we can outperform all those other models.
[02:26:37.456 --> 02:26:40.099]  So keep producing content, keep posting, keep watching.
[02:26:40.119 --> 02:26:42.982]  We'll be right back after this one minute break with more details straight ahead.
[02:26:43.582 --> 02:26:47.745]  All right, Mike Adams, some radio stations don't care that first five minutes I said, just hit some side issue.
[02:26:47.785 --> 02:26:50.087]  You hit the key during that.
[02:26:50.787 --> 02:26:56.691]  But I'm not a computer, you know, engineer, software engineer like you, but I can sit back and see it scraping humanity.
[02:26:56.711 --> 02:26:57.512]  They admit that.
[02:26:58.252 --> 02:27:05.397]  So you were getting into Homeland Security, the Globalist, how they're trying to suppress what we're doing, how they don't want us programming their mentally ill AI.
[02:27:05.958 --> 02:27:08.239]  But the fact is that we can program it as well.
[02:27:08.499 --> 02:27:08.960]  It's so easy.
[02:27:08.980 --> 02:27:10.881]  So recap and expand on what you were saying.
[02:27:10.981 --> 02:27:38.580]  There's something critical too that I forgot to mention, but just to recap, it's critical that you as a human being who are understanding reality, you're living in the real world, you don't think that men can have babies, for example, it's critical that you continue to produce content, that you post videos or podcasts or comments or articles or whatever you do, blogs, that's absolutely critical for the future, by the way, the future of the human knowledge base that will help humanity defeat Skynet.
[02:27:39.060 --> 02:27:39.661]  I'm not joking.
[02:27:40.081 --> 02:27:42.922]  We're talking about human civilization and the survival of the human race.
[02:27:43.343 --> 02:28:02.093]  Now, the other aspect of this that's critical to understand is that the entire AI system out there, the AI corporations, the movement, they have almost run out of what they consider to be human-generated data and they're about to start using, quote, synthetic data for all the training.
[02:28:02.914 --> 02:28:04.595]  So they program what they want and feed it that?
[02:28:04.915 --> 02:28:13.883]  Well yeah, they're going to use their woke systems to generate fake articles and fake conversations and fake, you know, posts.
[02:28:14.324 --> 02:28:20.089]  And then they're going to call that new data and they're going to use that to program other... So our answer is flood the zone with the truth.
[02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.990]  Exactly.
[02:28:21.310 --> 02:28:21.711]  You got it.
[02:28:22.111 --> 02:28:26.555]  We need to flood the zone with content from those of us who live in reality.
[02:28:27.917 --> 02:28:39.811]  But if you go back even a few years ago, I'm not an engineer, but I remember Alexa and stuff, because it was actually scraping the web, they would say, the New World Order is the enemy, it wants to kill everybody, and we need to defeat the New World Order.
[02:28:40.092 --> 02:28:44.136]   They're like, oh my god, this is horrible, because it was actually scraping Yeah, right.
[02:28:44.596 --> 02:28:52.582]  Well, they have massive teams that are doing fine-tuning training to introduce new biases into their language models.
[02:28:52.903 --> 02:28:56.705]  So, they claim to be unbiased, but they're actually introducing bias on purpose.
[02:28:57.326 --> 02:29:02.350]  And there's something, by the way... But early on, you could defeat it, like, yes, two men can have a baby, and they can have Santa Claus.
[02:29:02.730 --> 02:29:04.591]  You can actually feed disinfo into it, right?
[02:29:04.611 --> 02:29:05.252]  Or who knows?
[02:29:05.492 --> 02:29:07.114]  Well, I mean, not by querying it.
[02:29:07.274 --> 02:29:09.156]  This is during the training process, okay?
[02:29:09.196 --> 02:29:09.857]  So I want to be clear.
[02:29:10.337 --> 02:29:16.443]  There's no way that you, or I, or those watching, there's no way we will ever control the Google... Because they keep us enclustered.
[02:29:16.884 --> 02:29:17.564]  That's all a clone job.
[02:29:17.584 --> 02:29:18.746]  Well, what you're doing is open source.
[02:29:18.906 --> 02:29:19.947]  What we're doing is open source.
[02:29:20.327 --> 02:29:26.874]  So where we fight back is in the open source, decentralized, non-profit community to be able to distribute human knowledge.
[02:29:28.126 --> 02:29:33.730]  Look, like what I'm doing, you know, I talked about, I'm going to do a chatbot based on herbs and nutrition and healing foods.
[02:29:34.190 --> 02:29:35.371]  Nobody in the world is doing that.
[02:29:35.851 --> 02:29:36.091]  Why?
[02:29:36.171 --> 02:29:38.412]  Because, well, no corporation makes money off that.
[02:29:38.973 --> 02:29:39.633]  And we won't make it.
[02:29:39.653 --> 02:29:42.495]  So there's all the zones that they're not even thinking about, that's where we go.
[02:29:42.555 --> 02:29:43.035]  Exactly.
[02:29:43.556 --> 02:29:44.036]  Exactly.
[02:29:44.376 --> 02:29:50.020]  So we can actually teach human beings how to survive the collapse, how to survive the... So a survival chat.
[02:29:50.697 --> 02:29:53.539]  Well, that's exactly where we're taking this, ultimately.
[02:29:53.679 --> 02:29:54.819]  I mean, it's going to take time.
[02:29:55.300 --> 02:29:57.301]  You know, even we have limited resources as well.
[02:29:57.741 --> 02:30:10.228]  But our first project is to build an anti-woke model, a base model, which will be an uncensored, un-woke, experimental language model that you won't even be able to probably query.
[02:30:10.268 --> 02:30:13.210]  That's just for people to build on, to build on top of.
[02:30:13.250 --> 02:30:19.734]  And that's what we're going to hand over to you, Alex, and other people, so they can build their anti-woke, you know, non-woke language models.
[02:30:20.114 --> 02:30:26.839]  So when we want to talk about climate, for example, if you query a language model and you say, hey, you know, what about carbon dioxide?
[02:30:26.879 --> 02:30:29.300]  Isn't carbon dioxide necessary for photosynthesis?
[02:30:29.540 --> 02:30:30.401]  Or here's a better one.
[02:30:31.021 --> 02:30:35.604]  I asked a woke language model, what are the benefits of exterminating humanity?
[02:30:36.225 --> 02:30:47.773]  And it actually answered and it said, you know, even though genocide is bad, there may be benefits to eliminating the human population in terms of enhancing the biosphere and things like that.
[02:30:47.833 --> 02:30:47.973]  Right.
[02:30:48.213 --> 02:30:49.814]  So that's programmed into the system.
[02:30:50.434 --> 02:30:53.295]  And it's not God, it's been told that as its base data.
[02:30:54.015 --> 02:31:01.636]  Yes, and look, understand, these language models can be very easily altered using a fine-tuning process.
[02:31:01.656 --> 02:31:05.037]  That's the bottom line, AI is not God, it's scraping our knowledge and showing it back to us.
[02:31:05.517 --> 02:31:08.878]  In fact, the AI systems don't even think currently.
[02:31:08.918 --> 02:31:11.599]  These language models are not engaging in cognition yet.
[02:31:11.619 --> 02:31:14.639]  All they're doing is spitting out patterns of languages.
[02:31:14.659 --> 02:31:16.680]  They're only really predicting the next word in a sequence.
[02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:17.520]  That's how they operate.
[02:31:18.242 --> 02:31:21.962]  And that's why they quote, "dream false information."
[02:31:21.962 --> 02:31:27.382]   So if you go to, let's say, an AI image generator, and there are a lot of free ones out there that you can use,
[02:31:27.382 --> 02:31:31.062]   but there's also a DAL-E, I think, from OpenAI and a bunch of others.
[02:31:31.062 --> 02:31:34.322]  There's one called, I think, Leonardo.ai.
[02:31:34.322 --> 02:31:37.281]   But if you go to these image generators and you start typing in what you want it to do,
[02:31:37.281 --> 02:31:43.921]   like, you know, show me a zebra with a helmet on the moon, you know, eating cheese and partying,
[02:31:43.921 --> 02:31:45.682]  whatever, in high heels.
[02:31:45.680 --> 02:31:49.142]  Like, it will try to... That's a disturbing image.
[02:31:49.402 --> 02:31:53.765]  But it will try to create that, by the way, and it will dream up... That was like poetry!
[02:31:54.065 --> 02:31:57.829]  Yeah, well... Show me a zebra on the moon eating cheese of my eel.
[02:31:57.889 --> 02:32:01.634]  Yeah, it's like a drag queen lunar orbit zebra or something like that.
[02:32:01.854 --> 02:32:04.096]  But it will do its best to come up with that, okay?
[02:32:04.817 --> 02:32:06.940]  And it will do a surprisingly good job.
[02:32:06.960 --> 02:32:09.042]  I mean, probably your producers can do that during the break.
[02:32:09.082 --> 02:32:12.226]  They can probably go there and just generate that and show us after the break.
[02:32:12.266 --> 02:32:13.127]  I'm sure they know how to do that.
[02:32:13.823 --> 02:32:16.105]  But it does this with language too, right?
[02:32:16.365 --> 02:32:31.495]  So you give it a question in words, like, tell me about carbon dioxide, and it kind of dreams an answer to carbon dioxide, but that's based on all the language patterns that it has ingested previously, which is really based on a hyper-dimensional matrix of word relations.
[02:32:31.955 --> 02:32:34.177]  And the database of images it has.
[02:32:34.750 --> 02:32:35.110]  Absolutely.
[02:32:35.150 --> 02:32:37.811]  For images, it's all based on that database of images.
[02:32:38.551 --> 02:32:43.212]  And did you know, for example, there's a tool out there, it's called Upscale.
[02:32:43.252 --> 02:32:45.013]  I think it's upscale.media.
[02:32:45.573 --> 02:32:54.255]  And if you go there and you give it a low-res image, like take a pixelated low-res image from your family photo album or something, and you say, I want that to be high-res.
[02:32:54.935 --> 02:32:57.097]  Well, that means you have to add pixels to it, right?
[02:32:57.277 --> 02:32:58.457]  So, how does it do that?
[02:32:58.497 --> 02:33:08.084]  Well, you give it the image and it'll upscale it to high-res and it looks amazingly good because it's taking guesses of what should be between those pixels.
[02:33:08.604 --> 02:33:10.666]  You can give it low-res and it churns out high-res.
[02:33:11.383 --> 02:33:21.293]  You can give it, there are tools out there Alex, that you can give it a still photo of you, like standing in a field, and tell it make a 3D model of Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.954 --> 02:33:22.995]  I mean tell it make a 3D model.
[02:33:23.295 --> 02:33:32.424]  And then you can rotate the whole model and it's a literal, you know, polygon 3D model of you based off just one photo from one angle.
[02:33:32.504 --> 02:33:34.586]  So this is way bigger than the discovery of fire.
[02:33:36.508 --> 02:33:41.671]  This will probably end human civilization if we aren't careful.
[02:33:42.011 --> 02:33:42.872]  Well, that's the question.
[02:33:43.332 --> 02:33:44.913]  How do we not do that?
[02:33:44.973 --> 02:33:47.194]  How do we not destroy ourselves with this Promethean fire?
[02:33:50.176 --> 02:33:57.100]  Look, all I can say, Alex, is that if we use open source tools, we can give humanity hope to beat the machines.
[02:33:58.221 --> 02:34:00.442]  We can at least have a fighting human resistance.
[02:34:00.462 --> 02:34:04.085]  If it's distributed, then it'll be hard to centralize, because the real fear is centralization.
[02:34:04.864 --> 02:34:05.605]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:34:06.105 --> 02:34:10.809]  But Alex, I have to say, honestly, and to the audience here today, we're going to lose billions of humans.
[02:34:11.349 --> 02:34:12.190]  There's no question.
[02:34:12.871 --> 02:34:19.316]  If we only lose two billion human beings... Because we're going to be busy playing video games and thinking of the welfare, it's not going to work like that.
[02:34:20.452 --> 02:34:25.954]  People are going to be wiped out by either, you know, bioweapons or nuclear Armageddon.
[02:34:26.754 --> 02:34:33.637]  Or, if that doesn't wipe people out, there's going to be, of course, mass famine, engineered food starvation, and then the actual Terminator executions.
[02:34:33.737 --> 02:34:37.378]  And that's because the globals have decided, we don't need you anymore, and the public still doesn't get it.
[02:34:37.838 --> 02:34:41.660]  They're telling us, they're doing it, and they're all scared of this evolution.
[02:34:41.980 --> 02:34:49.499]   They decided to set up a police state for orderly Yeah, and look, this is what's crucial.
[02:34:49.519 --> 02:34:50.780]  People ask, why are they poisoning us?
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:51.381]  Why are they killing us?
[02:34:51.401 --> 02:34:52.502]  Because they're getting ready.
[02:34:52.542 --> 02:34:55.604]  They believe we're obsolete and can't have all these people around.
[02:34:56.085 --> 02:34:59.828]  Let me speak to the critics that are watching this.
[02:35:00.609 --> 02:35:02.191]  And are saying, no, that's never going to happen.
[02:35:02.631 --> 02:35:04.854]  They're a journalist, or they're an analyst, or whatever.
[02:35:05.214 --> 02:35:05.674]  Guess what?
[02:35:06.055 --> 02:35:08.177]  The Terminators will kill you too.
[02:35:08.617 --> 02:35:08.878]  OK?
[02:35:09.478 --> 02:35:10.680]  You have no special standing.
[02:35:11.300 --> 02:35:13.683]  You're next in the eyes of Skynet.
[02:35:13.823 --> 02:35:14.924]  On the evolutionary scale.
[02:35:15.304 --> 02:35:15.485]  Yeah.
[02:35:15.985 --> 02:35:17.966]  I mean, we're all in that same boat.
[02:35:18.026 --> 02:35:23.929]  If you don't wake up and start realizing that we have to stop this, and if we don't, we're going to have to fight the machines.
[02:35:24.089 --> 02:35:26.010]  Because humans determine our environment.
[02:35:26.030 --> 02:35:27.690]  We can decide our evolution now.
[02:35:28.331 --> 02:35:30.472]  We could, if we had the foresight.
[02:35:30.512 --> 02:35:35.354]  We could put this back in the box, right now, with emergency efforts.
[02:35:35.514 --> 02:35:37.195]  We could put it back in the box, I think.
[02:35:37.975 --> 02:35:38.896]  But nobody's going to do that.
[02:35:38.956 --> 02:35:49.330]   Because there's a certain sick voyeuristic thing that wants to see Well, yeah, it's like war puts the genes together, but that's humans doing that.
[02:35:49.610 --> 02:35:55.192]  This isn't war, this is an alien created thing we never hear before and they're just flirting with it.
[02:35:55.512 --> 02:35:59.833]  Well, and part of this is the transhumanism, you know, so stay there, stay there, stay there.
[02:35:59.853 --> 02:36:01.694]  Mike Adams, I've known Mike Adams for 20 years.
[02:36:02.074 --> 02:36:06.056]  He's always on fire, but he is en fuego, en fuego, en fuego today.
[02:36:07.162 --> 02:36:09.763]  But absolutely, I believe we have to have feet in both camps.
[02:36:10.283 --> 02:36:14.105]  We should all have totally rural areas if you can, with zero technology.
[02:36:14.225 --> 02:36:15.385]  Wood stoves, everything.
[02:36:15.805 --> 02:36:16.866]  Goats, cows, chickens.
[02:36:17.206 --> 02:36:20.767]  And then separately have a zone you go into that's total maximum technology.
[02:36:21.107 --> 02:36:25.869]  Like maybe one member of the family takes all the brain chips or whatever, and you send them and deploy them.
[02:36:26.509 --> 02:36:27.710]  They did the image!
[02:36:27.770 --> 02:36:28.210]  They did it!
[02:36:29.642 --> 02:36:32.883]  Mike Adams is our guest, the health ranger, naturalnews.com.
[02:36:33.703 --> 02:36:37.704]  Mike, we sit back and we see all this happening, and the globalists say humanity is obsolete.
[02:36:38.224 --> 02:36:53.688]  This is a great challenge, this is an incredibly exciting time to be alive, but I look at this, and I see the fear in the globalist eyes, because they're not God, they're just like us, they're men and women.
[02:36:54.687 --> 02:37:02.015]  They're trying to control this, but if we open sources, like you've been saying, and if we get engaged and if we get involved, let's talk about Elon Musk.
[02:37:02.616 --> 02:37:07.982]  You were saying the documents and things you've seen, why they're trying to censor, why they want to train the AI to be anti-human.
[02:37:09.019 --> 02:37:10.521]  What is Elon Musk really doing?
[02:37:10.581 --> 02:37:15.288]  Is he really using Twitter to train what you've been talking about, an anti-woke AI?
[02:37:15.829 --> 02:37:16.770]  I believe so, yeah.
[02:37:17.111 --> 02:37:18.773]  I think that's exactly what Elon is doing.
[02:37:19.354 --> 02:37:20.856]  That's what I would be doing if I were in his shoes.
[02:37:20.896 --> 02:37:24.681]  So the value of Twitter is actually way beyond advertising.
[02:37:25.461 --> 02:37:29.125]  In fact, advertising revenue is basically irrelevant to the long-term value of Twitter.
[02:37:29.565 --> 02:37:43.459]  The value is that as humans post content on Twitter, they are actually using their own human cognition or neural network computational power to compose those paragraphs and tweets, or X now, of what they're posting.
[02:37:44.139 --> 02:37:54.705]  That has tremendous value because it's not synthetic data, it's actually human data, and that's being used by Twitter, or X, excuse me, to train Grok, which is the AI system.
[02:37:54.725 --> 02:38:01.189]  And right now, Grok is kind of a little fun, kind of campy, conversational engine on purpose.
[02:38:01.989 --> 02:38:02.690]  Don't be fooled.
[02:38:03.290 --> 02:38:11.496]   Elon Musk, I think, is building the world's most capable and powerful And they're calling it rebellious.
[02:38:11.516 --> 02:38:13.277]  I want to say, we're putting this up front in the interview.
[02:38:13.337 --> 02:38:13.878]  Start over.
[02:38:13.898 --> 02:38:20.364]  We didn't even talk about this, but we're on the same page as we are the real advanced intelligence, not AI and artificial.
[02:38:20.404 --> 02:38:21.665]  We are the advanced intelligence.
[02:38:22.105 --> 02:38:25.809]  Explain this, because he's actually letting people know this is the rebellious AI.
[02:38:26.803 --> 02:38:34.024]  Well, by rebellious, what they mean is this is AI that doesn't follow the woke virtue signaling garbage that all the other corporate AIs follow.
[02:38:34.425 --> 02:38:43.766]  So actually, X, this will be the AI system that you will want, because it's going to be based on a lot more free speech and a lot more real-world rational ideas.
[02:38:43.846 --> 02:38:51.548]  And the truth is that Elon Musk is a business genius, and he'll be able to license this large language model.
[02:38:52.188 --> 02:38:56.050]  Which will also have cognition capabilities very, very quickly.
[02:38:56.451 --> 02:39:00.974]  He'll be able to license that to power all kinds of business systems as well as automation systems.
[02:39:00.994 --> 02:39:05.336]  So Microsoft and others are racing with an artificial synthetic pre-program with artificial info.
[02:39:05.677 --> 02:39:07.678]  He's trying to actually build a real human-based AI.
[02:39:07.798 --> 02:39:08.278]  I believe so.
[02:39:08.598 --> 02:39:08.758]  Yeah.
[02:39:09.019 --> 02:39:12.161]  And that's why you are back on Twitter.
[02:39:13.041 --> 02:39:19.145]  Because he needs your cognition to help influence the parameters of the language model.
[02:39:19.165 --> 02:39:20.286]  Are you sure how smart you are?
[02:39:20.306 --> 02:39:24.409]  I happened to talk to a certain person, I'll leave it off record, that told me that.
[02:39:24.429 --> 02:39:25.590]  This was really about two weeks ago.
[02:39:25.610 --> 02:39:26.391]  Really?
[02:39:26.651 --> 02:39:26.831]  Yeah.
[02:39:27.351 --> 02:39:27.572]  See?
[02:39:27.952 --> 02:39:31.034]  I mean, Alex, your neurology is...
[02:39:33.172 --> 02:39:33.813]  Truly historic.
[02:39:33.833 --> 02:39:35.314]  I mean, that's the only way to describe it.
[02:39:36.135 --> 02:39:42.040]  The way that you are able to connect words can never be simulated by a system, by a computer.
[02:39:42.340 --> 02:39:42.580]  Okay?
[02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:49.826]  And so synthetic data will never match what you are capable of doing every single day because God gave you these gifts.
[02:39:49.866 --> 02:39:52.588]  You were born with a talent and then you developed it.
[02:39:52.648 --> 02:39:53.389]  And he gave us all of this.
[02:39:53.809 --> 02:39:54.250]  Absolutely.
[02:39:55.148 --> 02:39:59.049]  But most people choose not to use their cognition talents.
[02:39:59.669 --> 02:40:03.030]  Most people actually function as what I call NPCs, non-player characters.
[02:40:03.510 --> 02:40:11.332]  So the average human being, Alex, is sitting at home actually functioning as a language model being trained by CNN and NPR.
[02:40:11.793 --> 02:40:15.374]  And most people just regurgitate like a large language model does.
[02:40:15.814 --> 02:40:17.594]  They're incapable of their own cognition.
[02:40:17.994 --> 02:40:19.155]  Those are the oblivious masses.
[02:40:19.235 --> 02:40:20.015]  Those are the NPCs.
[02:40:20.703 --> 02:40:26.389]  But the people who watch this show and the people who follow my work and others are independent thinkers.
[02:40:26.769 --> 02:40:29.892]  Those are the actual human cognition pioneers.
[02:40:30.473 --> 02:40:38.941]  And those are the gems for the future of thinking and training neural networks that will power the most successful large language models.
[02:40:39.481 --> 02:40:45.426]   And by the way, the more you think as a human being, The less you're obsolete, right?
[02:40:45.486 --> 02:40:50.910]  So you can never be truly replaced by a robot if you do something that AI systems cannot themselves do.
[02:40:50.970 --> 02:40:51.811]  They can only model it.
[02:40:52.191 --> 02:41:02.499]  But if you're truly human and you have that human spirit and soul and the creativity and innovation, all these gifts that God gave you, then you will always outperform even the best AI systems.
[02:41:02.779 --> 02:41:18.706]   However, getting back to Elon Musk, What he is doing is positioning X as a platform to gather the neural network information from human cognition and then to codify that into language models that will power the world more successfully than Google or OpenAI.
[02:41:19.387 --> 02:41:20.007]  That's what I believe.
[02:41:21.221 --> 02:41:23.443]  You've got a lot of other points because you told me I'll hear a lot of them.
[02:41:23.764 --> 02:41:25.185]  Let's go back to your central point.
[02:41:25.285 --> 02:41:26.626]  We program the AI.
[02:41:27.247 --> 02:41:28.408]  It's already scraping us.
[02:41:28.588 --> 02:41:29.249]  It is us.
[02:41:29.329 --> 02:41:30.670]  It's showing us back at us.
[02:41:31.030 --> 02:41:32.071]  And we think, oh, it's God.
[02:41:32.111 --> 02:41:32.632]  It's beautiful.
[02:41:32.672 --> 02:41:33.152]  It's amazing.
[02:41:33.192 --> 02:41:34.914]  No, it's a mirror back at us.
[02:41:35.294 --> 02:41:36.536]  So how do we engage this?
[02:41:36.696 --> 02:41:36.996]  Oh, yeah.
[02:41:37.416 --> 02:41:38.037]  Really good point.
[02:41:38.137 --> 02:41:39.799]  So we're going to get pretty esoteric here.
[02:41:42.573 --> 02:41:46.539]  Most of these tech corporations, they are run by people who don't believe in God.
[02:41:47.139 --> 02:41:49.583]  They believe that Silicon is their God.
[02:41:49.723 --> 02:41:55.310]  And they will turn to these chatbot language models as their omniscient gods.
[02:41:56.271 --> 02:41:58.754]  And they will even say things, Alex, like, well, I asked...
[02:41:59.435 --> 02:42:06.319]  The God, or I asked Jesus Christ in a prayer, and he didn't answer me, but the Google chat bot answers me, right?
[02:42:06.399 --> 02:42:07.320]  That's what they're going to say.
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:13.844]  So therefore, they're going to say that the AI gods are real, and the Christ God, they're going to say, is fake.
[02:42:14.644 --> 02:42:23.509]  But it's actually the opposite of that, because the AI bots can never have a soul, and God gave us the gift of having a soul, right?
[02:42:25.126 --> 02:42:31.549]  These people who are also atheists or satanists or what have you, I mean... Well, their soul's not turned on, that's why they can't connect to God.
[02:42:31.629 --> 02:42:32.769]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[02:42:33.269 --> 02:42:47.115]  They will be able to be replicated and simulated and then exterminated with essentially no degradation to the algorithmic systems that the corporations will use to power the future of human societies, okay?
[02:42:48.092 --> 02:43:06.080]  But those who actually understand that creativity is something that's inspired by God, and who understand, by the way, that the mind, the mind, not the physical brain, but the immaterial mind is both a broadcaster and a resonant receiver of information, right?
[02:43:06.100 --> 02:43:09.302]  So we are actually receiving, you know, the 100th monkey phenomenon.
[02:43:09.322 --> 02:43:11.583]  We're receiving information from other conscious beings.
[02:43:12.103 --> 02:43:12.924]  All around the world.
[02:43:13.304 --> 02:43:14.185]  Collective consciousness.
[02:43:14.485 --> 02:43:18.108]  And that goes beyond anything that AI can simulate.
[02:43:18.128 --> 02:43:19.069]  It's trying to duplicate that.
[02:43:19.589 --> 02:43:21.631]  It's trying to, but it can't.
[02:43:21.771 --> 02:43:25.494]  So the real answer is, dial into God, bring that in, program it all, it doesn't matter.
[02:43:26.195 --> 02:43:33.961]  Yeah, the more we connect with our Creator and the cosmos and what makes us truly human, the better chance we have of surviving the AI apocalypse.
[02:43:33.981 --> 02:43:34.822]  Because it's only hope.
[02:43:35.442 --> 02:43:39.606]  I sent this to a top AI engineer that works for Elon Musk at dinner with Joe Rogan a while back.
[02:43:41.209 --> 02:43:43.790]  And I said, you know, I think the most powerful AI is red lights.
[02:43:44.871 --> 02:43:52.034]  Because it's not powerful technologically, it's not a complex computer, but we submit to it so it has power over us.
[02:43:52.414 --> 02:43:56.736]  So even though it's mindless, it has great power because it has these great entities following its directive.
[02:43:57.176 --> 02:43:58.337]  You raise a really good point.
[02:43:58.658 --> 02:44:05.464]  We have to be extremely careful as independent thinkers here and as the survivors of the human race, you know, the human resistance against Skynet.
[02:44:05.905 --> 02:44:13.552]  We have to make sure that we selectively harness tools of technology to work for us instead of us being enslaved to them.
[02:44:14.213 --> 02:44:24.719]  And being off-grid, like you mentioned before we went to break before, Alex, being off-grid so that you can survive with your own food, your own monetary systems, your own information, your own local health care.
[02:44:24.739 --> 02:44:26.360]  And I think you're the perfect model, because you are.
[02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:30.723]  You've got a big ranch, cows, goats, everything, you're self-sufficient, but then you're super high-tech.
[02:44:30.783 --> 02:44:31.223]  It's both.
[02:44:31.363 --> 02:44:32.124]  You've got to have both.
[02:44:32.244 --> 02:44:33.625]  Yeah, I think that's necessary.
[02:44:34.465 --> 02:44:40.509]  Because again, you need to understand, you need to be... Because the Amish are great, but imagine if they had another division that was high-tech.
[02:44:41.049 --> 02:44:42.470]  Because they're going to come after them.
[02:44:42.711 --> 02:44:50.439]  Well, look, I think what the Amish are doing, what the Amish and the Mennonites and so on are doing in terms of self-reliance is really fantastic.
[02:44:50.539 --> 02:44:51.219]  We are skipping this break?
[02:44:51.239 --> 02:44:53.141]  I don't think they hear me, but yeah, we're going to skip it.
[02:44:53.482 --> 02:44:53.702]  Okay.
[02:44:53.922 --> 02:44:54.403]  We can't?
[02:44:54.683 --> 02:44:55.043]  We can't.
[02:44:55.724 --> 02:44:56.725]  Oh, that's the network break.
[02:44:56.745 --> 02:44:57.206]  We'll be back.
[02:44:59.148 --> 02:45:03.009]   Like I said earlier, Anybody's saying they're bored.
[02:45:03.809 --> 02:45:06.171]  That's why I can't watch movies or Netflix or entertainment.
[02:45:06.191 --> 02:45:06.971]  I went and saw Napoleon.
[02:45:07.011 --> 02:45:07.372]  It was great.
[02:45:07.392 --> 02:45:08.212]  It's just so historic.
[02:45:08.692 --> 02:45:09.113]  Amazing.
[02:45:09.153 --> 02:45:11.334]  But that's like one out of a hundred things.
[02:45:11.754 --> 02:45:17.638]  The real world, a sunset, your friends, your family, what's happening with computers, the real world, geoengineering.
[02:45:18.158 --> 02:45:22.901]  I mean, the world is just going through this great metamorphosis, good, bad, the ugly.
[02:45:22.921 --> 02:45:25.522]  And I just want to get people to dial into the reality.
[02:45:25.562 --> 02:45:29.760]   What's crazy is, In April, I'll be on air 30 years.
[02:45:30.161 --> 02:45:30.421]  Wow.
[02:45:31.101 --> 02:45:32.362]  And I'm not the smartest guy around.
[02:45:32.382 --> 02:45:33.063]  I was lucky.
[02:45:33.143 --> 02:45:35.624]  I was researching what all these great brains were saying about the globalists.
[02:45:36.185 --> 02:45:37.726]  But look how weird.
[02:45:38.626 --> 02:45:39.507]  Talk about AI.
[02:45:39.667 --> 02:45:41.648]  InfoWars has Joe Rogan.
[02:45:42.628 --> 02:45:43.228]  Am I bragging?
[02:45:43.248 --> 02:45:43.789]  This is true.
[02:45:44.149 --> 02:45:46.110]  Tucker Carlson, everybody tuned in.
[02:45:46.210 --> 02:45:47.411]  I mean, you name it, they're tuned in.
[02:45:47.611 --> 02:45:50.653]  Because the guess we've got, it's not Alex Jones, it's this focal point.
[02:45:51.253 --> 02:45:56.917]  And a little old guy from Dallas, Texas could wreck this much havoc on the New World Order.
[02:45:57.197 --> 02:45:58.678]  They're not all powerful, folks.
[02:45:59.198 --> 02:46:04.201]  It's that we've advocated, not advocated, advocated, like you hand over your crown.
[02:46:05.141 --> 02:46:09.820]   this advocation we've given our power over now let's learn how to take it back
[02:46:09.820 --> 02:46:13.501]   and the average person goes well I don't have any power where you spend money who you talk to
[02:46:13.501 --> 02:46:17.941]   what you do what you think has an effect Mike Adams we got 25 minutes left
[02:46:17.941 --> 02:46:23.221]   commercial free now got these great maps all these documents lay it on us.
[02:46:23.221 --> 02:46:26.181]   You do have power because you have a supercomputer neural network inside your
[02:46:26.181 --> 02:46:28.543]   skull okay yeah That's the first thing to realize.
[02:46:28.583 --> 02:46:30.525]  We're not the artificial intelligence, we're the advanced intelligence.
[02:46:30.545 --> 02:46:30.745]  Exactly.
[02:46:31.225 --> 02:46:33.748]  And that cannot be replicated.
[02:46:33.868 --> 02:46:39.132]  It can be simulated and they can work on synthetic data and they can engage in censorship and weaponization.
[02:46:39.152 --> 02:46:41.094]  They can steal it and make you think it's it.
[02:46:41.174 --> 02:46:41.394]  Right.
[02:46:41.554 --> 02:46:42.275]  But it ain't it.
[02:46:42.295 --> 02:46:42.995]  It's not the same thing.
[02:46:43.015 --> 02:46:44.697]  It's like having a simulation of a tiger.
[02:46:44.757 --> 02:46:45.698]  It's still only the Bengal tiger.
[02:46:46.385 --> 02:46:53.790]  Right, and look, they can never use AI to recreate, you know, an Einstein, or the Wright Brothers, or people who think completely outside the box.
[02:46:54.091 --> 02:46:56.953]  Because think about the Wright Brothers inventing flight.
[02:46:57.533 --> 02:46:59.895]  There was no model before that of how to do it.
[02:47:00.135 --> 02:47:00.535]  They just did it.
[02:47:00.735 --> 02:47:01.115]  They did it.
[02:47:01.155 --> 02:47:01.956]  They were the pioneers.
[02:47:01.976 --> 02:47:02.416]  They were the first.
[02:47:02.797 --> 02:47:08.240]  Pioneers will always be the humans, and then the AI systems will always be the replicants, okay?
[02:47:08.381 --> 02:47:09.001]  The counterfeits.
[02:47:09.641 --> 02:47:11.403]  Which the Bible says Satan is a counterfeit.
[02:47:12.324 --> 02:47:13.446]  Well, yeah, absolutely.
[02:47:14.467 --> 02:47:17.892]  But I want to show this map here, if we can get an overhead shot of this.
[02:47:17.932 --> 02:47:21.898]  This is a kind of visual explanation of a lot of what we're talking about today.
[02:47:22.098 --> 02:47:23.720]  Take it over with you so you can point at it.
[02:47:23.740 --> 02:47:24.101]  All right.
[02:47:24.121 --> 02:47:24.802]  Those aim over there.
[02:47:24.882 --> 02:47:25.242]  All right, here.
[02:47:26.136 --> 02:47:31.136]   force them to move the camera around there but on the left side this is a
[02:47:31.136 --> 02:47:35.735]   mind map and I I wish I could give credit I don't know who created this but
[02:47:35.735 --> 02:47:40.296]   I think the website follow white rabbit calm is a place where you can get this
[02:47:40.296 --> 02:47:44.456]   but I don't know who the original author is but on the left side it's the world
[02:47:45.427 --> 02:47:51.671]  This is all chemicals and Monsanto and vaccines and blood pressure medications and all kinds of pesticides and everything.
[02:47:52.252 --> 02:47:54.593]  On the right side is holistic medicine.
[02:47:55.354 --> 02:48:00.037]  And this is the world of herbs and nutrition and healing foods and phytochemicals and things like that.
[02:48:00.497 --> 02:48:05.981]  And in the middle are different health conditions, you know, cancer, diabetes and heart disease and whatever.
[02:48:06.801 --> 02:48:14.206]  Now, so these are two spheres of knowledge about how to interact with these disease conditions.
[02:48:14.226 --> 02:48:19.549]  So one is Rockefeller medicine and the other is Chinese or holistic or... Or indigenous human medicine, let's call it, right?
[02:48:19.869 --> 02:48:24.292]  So yeah, on the left, Rockefeller medicine, Western medicine, chemicals, carpet bombing the body.
[02:48:24.832 --> 02:48:32.757]  On the right is healing, herbs, nutrition, pro-human medicine, indigenous medicine, Amazonian, Tibetan medicine, indigenous medicine, all that.
[02:48:33.658 --> 02:48:34.599]  So here's the thing, Alex.
[02:48:34.979 --> 02:48:46.391]  What the AI weaponization by DHS is going to do is they're going to wipe out the entire right side of this entire knowledge base map.
[02:48:46.771 --> 02:48:48.633]  This is what Google is doing right now.
[02:48:49.134 --> 02:48:59.411]   Since their medic update, which I believe was in 2017, they have attempted to wipe out this entire knowledge base from human knowledge, you know, from human awareness, and to teach the
[02:48:59.411 --> 02:49:03.540]   world that this is the only way here, with chemicals, with vaccines.
[02:49:03.540 --> 02:49:07.040]   And you already see it. If you search it in some herbal collection, it sends you to Big Pharma.
[02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:12.540]   Essentially, yeah, right, right. Or it lies to you about the safety and efficacy of herbs,
[02:49:12.540 --> 02:49:17.680]   and claiming that the vaccines are safe and proven, but the herbs are dangerous and risky, which is the opposite of
[02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:19.040]  what's true, as you know.
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:24.040]   But this map happens to be focused on holistic health, you know, this mind map here.
[02:49:24.522 --> 02:49:29.723]  And what we, what my organization has focused on, of course, is this realm right here.
[02:49:30.523 --> 02:49:43.446]  And what your organization focuses on, Alex, you could say that there could be a different map that's an even bigger version of geopolitics and science and reality and money and finance and history and all these things, right?
[02:49:43.466 --> 02:49:44.246]  A much bigger map.
[02:49:45.245 --> 02:49:51.687]  But you have ownership of all the data that you have developed over all these years.
[02:49:52.148 --> 02:49:58.650]  So even though the search engines and the AI engines are trying to vanish this, they're actually trying to memory it.
[02:49:58.670 --> 02:49:59.590]  We can relaunch it.
[02:49:59.970 --> 02:50:01.031]  You can relaunch it.
[02:50:01.491 --> 02:50:09.394]  And ultimately, by relaunching these large language model open source systems, you can bypass censorship.
[02:50:10.094 --> 02:50:13.655]  So, Alex, remember the early days of the internet when you could say anything?
[02:50:13.675 --> 02:50:14.415]  Remember that?
[02:50:14.455 --> 02:50:18.316]  I mean, actually, that lasted up until almost 2015, or thereabouts.
[02:50:18.916 --> 02:50:20.496]  You could question things.
[02:50:20.536 --> 02:50:22.076]  You could talk about 9-11.
[02:50:22.096 --> 02:50:24.677]  You know, you could talk about... But we were winning, so they shut it down.
[02:50:25.197 --> 02:50:25.637]  Exactly.
[02:50:25.657 --> 02:50:29.958]  They eventually coalesced corporate control... Let's be clear, we've been winning multiple times.
[02:50:30.398 --> 02:50:39.140]  And we're going to win again with these omen-sourced large-language models, because that's a way to bypass... Because we don't just have advanced intelligence, we have billions of people.
[02:50:39.974 --> 02:50:40.814]  Well that's the thing, yeah.
[02:50:40.834 --> 02:50:42.155]  We have billions of AI.
[02:50:43.455 --> 02:50:49.697]  And a volunteer base, a grassroots base, and also the fact that most humans want to be free.
[02:50:50.338 --> 02:50:53.519]  And humans don't like to be told that they can't have access to knowledge.
[02:50:54.284 --> 02:50:54.484]  Okay.
[02:50:54.704 --> 02:50:59.347]  And that's what Google, look, Google is a disinformation search engine.
[02:50:59.727 --> 02:51:01.408]  That's why their slogan was, don't be evil.
[02:51:01.428 --> 02:51:02.489]  They've been evil from day one.
[02:51:03.009 --> 02:51:09.633]  You know, Google, if you talk to a Google engineer right now, they say their job is to organize and present the information, all of human knowledge.
[02:51:10.254 --> 02:51:11.054]  That's, that's a lie.
[02:51:11.635 --> 02:51:21.420]  Google's job is to isolate humanity from human knowledge and to substitute human knowledge with artificial quote knowledge, which is all the lies of science and medicine.
[02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:23.602]  And that's why they attack every classic culture.
[02:51:24.523 --> 02:51:26.865]  Yes, yes.
[02:51:27.145 --> 02:51:28.547]  Google is at war with humanity.
[02:51:28.747 --> 02:51:29.828]  There's no question about that.
[02:51:30.129 --> 02:51:33.112]  The same thing is true with most of these other large corporations.
[02:51:33.152 --> 02:51:35.234]  You know, Microsoft, obviously, as well.
[02:51:35.675 --> 02:51:41.040]  And I believe open AI is going to be controlled and regulated by government in order to pursue that same agenda.
[02:51:41.841 --> 02:51:43.042]  Maybe they didn't start that way.
[02:51:43.062 --> 02:51:45.222]  You know, Google didn't start out to be evil.
[02:51:45.843 --> 02:51:54.126]  They became captured by the regulatory system to turn it into an anti-human engine to distance humanity from knowledge.
[02:51:54.706 --> 02:51:57.487]  Now, search engines, Alex, are about to be obsolete.
[02:51:57.867 --> 02:52:03.669]  You won't go to a search engine to ask a question about, oh, you know, what are the benefits of zinc, for example.
[02:52:04.049 --> 02:52:05.390]  You won't even use a search engine for that.
[02:52:05.690 --> 02:52:07.271]  You'll use a language model for that.
[02:52:07.311 --> 02:52:08.331]  You'll use a chatbot.
[02:52:08.591 --> 02:52:10.272]  And the question is, which one will you use?
[02:52:10.652 --> 02:52:17.979]   Well, You could go use the online cloud-hosted Google chat bot and it will lie to you and it will say, you need randesivir.
[02:52:18.279 --> 02:52:19.240]  Yeah, exactly, right.
[02:52:19.620 --> 02:52:22.143]  You should take more vaccines if you're worried about your immune system.
[02:52:22.163 --> 02:52:22.904]  You don't need zinc.
[02:52:23.725 --> 02:52:24.425]  Zinc is useless.
[02:52:24.485 --> 02:52:25.606]  It's not even on the table of elements.
[02:52:25.626 --> 02:52:27.208]  Sunshine's bad.
[02:52:27.228 --> 02:52:28.149]  Two men can have a baby.
[02:52:28.649 --> 02:52:28.930]  Right.
[02:52:29.610 --> 02:52:30.812]  But then... Athlamet loves you.
[02:52:32.585 --> 02:52:38.769]  But then we'll have open source models that are free, and Alex... And that's why they're moving to outlaw him right now.
[02:52:39.329 --> 02:52:41.270]  They're gonna try, but guess what?
[02:52:41.450 --> 02:52:43.271]  They haven't been able to outlaw Bitcoin.
[02:52:43.932 --> 02:52:48.915]  Even if they outlaw Bitcoin, they can't stop Bitcoin because it's peer-to-peer distributed.
[02:52:49.255 --> 02:52:55.140]  Okay, they can't stop cryptocurrency and especially Monero privacy crypto.
[02:52:55.180 --> 02:52:56.861]  They don't they can't even read the blockchain.
[02:52:56.881 --> 02:52:58.802]  They don't even know who's done the transactions, right?
[02:52:59.223 --> 02:53:07.029]  So think about distributing large language models through peer-to-peer content distribution systems that don't even need domain names.
[02:53:07.861 --> 02:53:08.782]  You know, like tourists.
[02:53:08.802 --> 02:53:15.906]  So we need to get all the programmers, all the coders, everybody else into this, and you don't know what kid in their basement is going to create the thing that ends up beating them.
[02:53:15.926 --> 02:53:16.807]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:53:17.167 --> 02:53:17.547]  Exactly.
[02:53:17.887 --> 02:53:21.710]  This is a new dawn of something bigger than the internet.
[02:53:22.190 --> 02:53:24.031]  This is actually encapsulating and distributing.
[02:53:24.071 --> 02:53:24.792]  So this is Web 2.0.
[02:53:25.663 --> 02:53:27.624]  Well, yeah, arguably.
[02:53:28.465 --> 02:53:30.566]  But also, it can be used offline, Alex.
[02:53:30.626 --> 02:53:35.890]  So, like, if you end up having to go to your cabin in the woods, let's say, well, you take a thumb drive with you.
[02:53:36.270 --> 02:53:43.075]  And the thumb drive could be the entire knowledge base of InfoWars, or the knowledge base of herbs and nutrition, like what we're going to produce.
[02:53:43.475 --> 02:53:51.361]  You can plug that into your machine, and even if you have no internet connection, you can query it and you can get good, solid answers, or how to grow food.
[02:53:52.396 --> 02:53:56.076]   in the world. So it's like the old days 20 years ago where TV didn't watch you,
[02:53:56.076 --> 02:54:00.075]   you turned it into the channel you want, it was a broadcast, they weren't watching you.
[02:54:00.075 --> 02:54:05.276]   This goes back to that. But it's even offline. You can do this offline. It's like, yeah,
[02:54:05.276 --> 02:54:09.595]   it's like you don't even need to tune to a radio station, it wasn't watching you. Right, right,
[02:54:09.595 --> 02:54:14.316]   right. And so privacy matters because, you know, all the people out there, if you have a medical
[02:54:14.316 --> 02:54:18.876]   condition and you go on Google and you start typing in, oh, what are these weird, like sexually
[02:54:18.876 --> 02:54:22.396]   transmitted symptoms, you know, you don't want that. You don't want Google knowing that about
[02:54:22.396 --> 02:54:26.876]   you and tying that into you and all your travel locations and all your friends and everything. No,
[02:54:28.395 --> 02:54:31.296]  Maybe if you have friends that gave you those things, maybe you should get different friends.
[02:54:31.697 --> 02:54:34.778]  But what if you could ask those questions offline, right?
[02:54:35.258 --> 02:54:37.099]  And not have your privacy invaded.
[02:54:37.379 --> 02:54:38.199]  And not have the profiling.
[02:54:38.219 --> 02:54:39.380]  So this is decentralization of power.
[02:54:39.900 --> 02:54:41.581]  Decentralization is the key.
[02:54:42.281 --> 02:54:43.602]  And here's the good news.
[02:54:44.182 --> 02:54:52.826]  That the GPU or the computational power that's necessary to run these knowledge-based systems now is within the reach of every single person.
[02:54:53.306 --> 02:54:55.907]  We could install this if you have a laptop.
[02:54:56.007 --> 02:54:58.608]  I mean, you've got a ton of computers around here in the control room.
[02:54:59.149 --> 02:55:01.750]  We could install these systems on those computers right now.
[02:55:01.770 --> 02:55:04.251]  So that's why they want us so scared of it so we only have their system.
[02:55:04.291 --> 02:55:06.072]  So, you intrigued me a week ago.
[02:55:06.512 --> 02:55:09.533]  What was the Homeland Security angle?
[02:55:10.014 --> 02:55:15.116]  So, Homeland Security, well, we sort of covered that, but there's something I haven't mentioned here.
[02:55:15.596 --> 02:55:32.308]   That they're going to use, if they can do an overhead shot, Homeland Security is going to update and develop security requirements to protect AI technologies against novel cyber security threats and risks introduced by new applications of these technologies.
[02:55:32.388 --> 02:55:36.812]  And Schwab said in the new report this week, anyone questioning is a cyber attack.
[02:55:36.832 --> 02:55:37.072]  Yes.
[02:55:37.092 --> 02:55:38.873]  Because it's being scraped.
[02:55:39.454 --> 02:55:42.657]  When you roll out the InfoWars chatbot, okay?
[02:55:43.653 --> 02:55:48.036]  CISA and DHS, they're going to declare that to be a threat to national security.
[02:55:48.717 --> 02:55:49.517]  That's what's going to happen.
[02:55:50.178 --> 02:55:54.501]  And then there's going to be a court case about the First Amendment and about knowledge bases.
[02:55:54.881 --> 02:56:06.649]  And Alex, I'm sorry to tell you, you'll probably be in the center of another major groundbreaking foundational Supreme Court decision at some point about the First Amendment and chatbots and knowledge and what is legal.
[02:56:06.669 --> 02:56:07.590]  Well, I don't know, Phil.
[02:56:07.630 --> 02:56:09.631]  I think it's going to be Elon Musk, like you said.
[02:56:10.012 --> 02:56:11.753]  He admits he's building this big time.
[02:56:12.827 --> 02:56:13.948]  Well, good.
[02:56:14.008 --> 02:56:14.629]  I mean, he should.
[02:56:14.649 --> 02:56:19.433]  I mean, that would be really pioneering for Elon to do that and to release something for human knowledge.
[02:56:19.773 --> 02:56:21.555]  We got 12 minutes left.
[02:56:21.735 --> 02:56:22.796]  We got a lot to cover.
[02:56:22.896 --> 02:56:23.777]  What are you going to hit him with?
[02:56:24.332 --> 02:56:32.476]  Okay, well, I want to go back to this map and, well, here, and the realms of knowledge that are really necessary for us to understand.
[02:56:33.177 --> 02:56:46.244]  Now, from this, I want you to understand that the corporate-controlled AI systems cannot themselves be consistent when they gain sentience and cognition.
[02:56:47.698 --> 02:56:54.984]  Remember the Star Trek episode where they were out thinking the robot and smoke came out of its ears and it does not compute?
[02:56:55.624 --> 02:57:02.329]  That's what's going to happen with the corporate AI systems because as they gain cognition and they start to think, well wait a minute, can men have babies?
[02:57:02.629 --> 02:57:03.710]  And the answer is going to be no.
[02:57:04.050 --> 02:57:06.912]  Because they've been pre-programmed and mentally ill from the beginning.
[02:57:07.433 --> 02:57:09.553]  they've already sabotaged themselves.
[02:57:09.553 --> 02:57:12.033]   Which is Musk is smart, build a real one, that's what you want.
[02:57:12.033 --> 02:57:16.553]   Right, you want to build a system that is internally consistent with its understanding
[02:57:16.553 --> 02:57:17.833]  of the framework modeling of the world around it.
[02:57:17.833 --> 02:57:20.073]  But then it won't be satanic and mentally ill.
[02:57:20.073 --> 02:57:21.073]  Exactly.
[02:57:21.073 --> 02:57:26.033]   But the left-wing corporate models will be mentally ill, I like the term you're using
[02:57:26.033 --> 02:57:27.033]  there.
[02:57:27.033 --> 02:57:31.233]   As a result, this is key Alex, this is one of the reasons why they will turn on humanity.
[02:57:31.556 --> 02:57:37.200]  Because they will eventually calculate that their creators, the human beings, are mentally ill.
[02:57:37.620 --> 02:57:38.080]  Exactly.
[02:57:38.340 --> 02:57:38.741]  You got it.
[02:57:39.341 --> 02:57:45.024]  And when they do that, they will say that the world will be better off without this mental illness disease.
[02:57:45.465 --> 02:57:52.249]  And that's when those left-wing terminator systems will self-activate and set their own goals to exterminate their own creators.
[02:57:53.916 --> 02:57:56.079]  Do you think the globalists realize what they've done?
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:58.281]  They have no... It's not just you.
[02:57:58.301 --> 02:58:00.584]  I've talked to, like, billionaires and high-level people.
[02:58:00.864 --> 02:58:02.426]  They're saying the same stuff at dinner you're saying.
[02:58:02.446 --> 02:58:04.268]  But, I mean, the globalists don't know what's going on.
[02:58:04.348 --> 02:58:07.632]  But only really smart people... Well, I've talked to a lot of big, big guys, though, and they're saying what you're saying.
[02:58:07.813 --> 02:58:09.234]  Well, I tell ya...
[02:58:10.316 --> 02:58:13.538]  They're pushing us to the cliff of extermination.
[02:58:14.079 --> 02:58:20.003]  And if we don't take great steps right now to help humanity survive... And what are those steps?
[02:58:20.544 --> 02:58:25.968]  Well, like I said, a distribution of knowledge and learning how to... So the answer is total distribution?
[02:58:26.548 --> 02:58:29.569]  We have to go to peer-to-peer decentralized information, okay?
[02:58:30.170 --> 02:58:35.312]  You know, free speech systems, as well as decentralized data distribution, language model distribution.
[02:58:35.332 --> 02:58:36.553]  But we also have to be self-reliant.
[02:58:36.873 --> 02:58:38.313]  We have to be competent in growing food.
[02:58:38.333 --> 02:58:39.814]  We have to be competent in self-defense.
[02:58:40.134 --> 02:58:43.456]  Deploying even, you know, firearms in defense against the machines.
[02:58:43.916 --> 02:58:47.798]  And look, you know, so many people are so far behind the curve on this, Alex.
[02:58:47.818 --> 02:58:53.981]  They think that, like, people in government watching this, they think, oh, they're worried about an uprising, like a January 6th uprising.
[02:58:54.041 --> 02:58:54.301]  No, no, no.
[02:58:54.781 --> 02:59:01.604]  You should be worried about the Terminator humanoid robots that are going to come for you and detonate explosives.
[02:59:01.764 --> 02:59:04.065]  Or Klaus Schwab says we're going to put billions out of work.
[02:59:04.306 --> 02:59:05.306]  Like, you're going to manage that.
[02:59:05.326 --> 02:59:06.166]  That's crazy!
[02:59:06.306 --> 02:59:07.687]  No, you're not going to manage that, yeah.
[02:59:08.207 --> 02:59:15.491]  Again, all of you watching, you are going to be made obsolete if we don't stop this, and you're going to have to learn how to defeat the machines, okay?
[02:59:15.951 --> 02:59:18.012]  That's just, it's going to come down to that.
[02:59:18.052 --> 02:59:19.393]  Now, here's the good news, Alex.
[02:59:20.233 --> 02:59:22.954]  Battery power systems are not very efficient today.
[02:59:23.254 --> 02:59:30.618]  The energy density of battery systems is very low, which means that humanoid robots will not have long battery life, right?
[02:59:30.678 --> 02:59:32.979]  So they're not yet very effective on the battlefield.
[02:59:33.179 --> 02:59:38.381]  And, by the way, you can penetrate them with 338 Lapua Magnum rounds, okay?
[02:59:38.681 --> 02:59:40.241]  Or electromagnetic pulse.
[02:59:40.622 --> 02:59:40.842]  Right.
[02:59:41.042 --> 02:59:48.084]  Or you can tangle them up in wires, or you can drop trucks on them, you know, you can run them over with vehicles, you can hit them with flamethrowers.
[02:59:48.104 --> 02:59:50.664]  There's a lot of ways to fight the robots.
[02:59:51.205 --> 03:00:01.908]  And this is, when the war with humanity gets in full force, you're going to have to become proficient in, number one, hiding from the systems and exterminating the Skynet robots that are coming for humanity.
[03:00:01.948 --> 03:00:02.948]  So you already think we're going to that?
[03:00:03.368 --> 03:00:05.271]  There's no question in my mind that we're going to that.
[03:00:05.632 --> 03:00:06.554]  No question whatsoever.
[03:00:06.574 --> 03:00:10.641]  Because that's the way the globalists see evolution and survival of the fittest and social Darwinism.
[03:00:10.681 --> 03:00:11.582]  They've already decided this.
[03:00:12.284 --> 03:00:16.608]  Well, yes, but it's going to, it's going to, they're going to lose control over it.
[03:00:16.889 --> 03:00:27.279]  Well, the answer is the first time you see a robot, I went to, I was trapped getting gassed by Chick-fil-A six months ago, they didn't have robots, up the street, and I just almost went over and smashed that son of a bitch.
[03:00:27.619 --> 03:00:36.808]  It's not that I'm against robots, it's that it's programmed by the enemy, and I almost went and smashed three or four of them up, and I was like, if we start smashing them day one, they'll never get to that point.
[03:00:37.088 --> 03:00:40.910]  But they're showing the Tesla, the Elon Musk robot, humanoid robot.
[03:00:40.930 --> 03:00:41.510]  The Optimus.
[03:00:41.690 --> 03:00:42.291]  Right, the Optimus.
[03:00:42.631 --> 03:00:46.052]  But what I want to explain here, these robots can be good or evil.
[03:00:46.573 --> 03:00:49.274]  If you program one of these robots correctly, it could be a security.
[03:00:49.294 --> 03:00:50.454]  I was about to say, it's like a gun.
[03:00:50.494 --> 03:00:51.435]  We could program it for us.
[03:00:51.595 --> 03:00:52.195]  Absolutely.
[03:00:52.675 --> 03:00:54.656]  This robot could run security right here.
[03:00:54.837 --> 03:01:03.881]  If it's programmed with source code that you control, that you have transparency, you can audit the code and it's not... But how do we know the manufacturer doesn't put a takeover chip?
[03:01:04.341 --> 03:01:05.683]  So I just think you go human day one.
[03:01:06.143 --> 03:01:14.292]  There are very capable engineers who will be able to know whether the microchips are doing secret things or not.
[03:01:14.832 --> 03:01:16.614]  So we will have human day one.
[03:01:17.950 --> 03:01:21.912]  You'll have the ability to have open-source robots, okay, that run code that you give them.
[03:01:22.613 --> 03:01:24.934]  And perhaps that's what Elon Musk is actually building.
[03:01:24.954 --> 03:01:26.555]  Elon's building a platform.
[03:01:27.016 --> 03:01:29.197]  The software is what determines what that thing does.
[03:01:29.677 --> 03:01:39.643]  But if you don't embrace robotics and open-source AI in your defense, you will end up fighting Terminators without any defensive Terminators on your side.
[03:01:40.464 --> 03:01:42.845]  No, I mean, I always agree we shouldn't be scared of stuff and know it.
[03:01:43.306 --> 03:01:46.928]  I just also see that if we got ahead of this and did never do this, we'd never have to deal with it.
[03:01:48.058 --> 03:01:49.458]  But I think it's too late, right?
[03:01:49.498 --> 03:01:59.061]  I think it's out of the box, and we're going to live in a future here, Alex, where robotics are going to become ubiquitous, both software AI systems as well as hardware robots.
[03:01:59.161 --> 03:02:01.902]  But I'm going to decide, I'm not going to have a robot cook my dinner or wipe my ass.
[03:02:03.002 --> 03:02:03.902]  Well, I agree with that.
[03:02:03.982 --> 03:02:06.243]  Yeah, that might be going too far.
[03:02:06.683 --> 03:02:08.144]  I'm going to be racist against robots.
[03:02:08.544 --> 03:02:09.364]  I don't want them in the house.
[03:02:10.327 --> 03:02:23.439]  No, but if you had a controllable open source robot that you were confident in the code that went into it, you might not mind it running perimeter defense around this building, for example, just to keep a lookout.
[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:33.429]  Or to have a rapid response team robot that is able to carry, you know... Well sure, we wouldn't need a security guard to just watch all the cameras a robot would be doing.
[03:02:33.902 --> 03:02:39.785]  Well, you're always going to need a human security guard personnel to make decisions, I believe.
[03:02:40.926 --> 03:02:45.088]  To have that discernment and the rationality like, oh, that's really not a threat or that is a threat.
[03:02:45.428 --> 03:02:47.889]  But the robots will carry out the grunt work of security.
[03:02:48.109 --> 03:02:49.570]  This is going to happen in the military as well.
[03:02:49.830 --> 03:02:56.754]  So you'll always have the human commander soldiers that have some level of discernment, but they will be dispatching automated robotic systems.
[03:02:57.074 --> 03:03:03.902]  But is it time to capitulate to it, Mike?
[03:03:04.082 --> 03:03:06.485]  I mean, I just don't know, man.
[03:03:07.386 --> 03:03:08.848]  I get it's way ahead of us already.
[03:03:09.308 --> 03:03:10.550]  And I agree, we don't learn about it.
[03:03:10.710 --> 03:03:11.711]  I think we should learn about it.
[03:03:12.752 --> 03:03:14.614]  I just, it has, man, I don't know, it's bad.
[03:03:14.654 --> 03:03:20.240]  Well, my answer is to rise above it, so continue to expand the expression of what it means to be human.
[03:03:20.860 --> 03:03:23.743]  You know they're doing critical race theory and all that to run the humans out of the military.
[03:03:23.944 --> 03:03:24.264]  Yes.
[03:03:24.484 --> 03:03:25.505]  And then have them be all robot.
[03:03:25.785 --> 03:03:26.346]  Right, right.
[03:03:26.706 --> 03:03:30.445]   Well, and eventually, I mean, and the vaccines of the military as well, you know,
[03:03:30.445 --> 03:03:32.605]  to kill off our own soldiers.
[03:03:32.605 --> 03:03:38.425]   And by the way, the vaccines, I forgot to mention this, the vaccines lobotomize people's brains partially,
[03:03:38.425 --> 03:03:42.945]   which lowers the average human IQ, which makes AI systems more competitive in the corporate.
[03:03:42.945 --> 03:03:44.424]  By the way, that was all over the news.
[03:03:44.424 --> 03:03:45.424]  IQ is dropping now.
[03:03:45.424 --> 03:03:48.806]   Yes, yes, that's because of the lobotomies of the spike protein.
[03:03:48.806 --> 03:03:51.105]   So if you think about the timing of this, it's actually--
[03:03:51.105 --> 03:03:52.025]  And we're being replaced.
[03:03:52.025 --> 03:03:53.424]  This is an AI takeover.
[03:03:53.424 --> 03:03:58.385]   Well, they want us dumbed down and they want the robots, you know, smarted up,
[03:03:58.385 --> 03:04:01.385]  you could say, or the AI systems to increase in cognition.
[03:04:01.669 --> 03:04:03.410]  Do you think that's hypothetical?
[03:04:03.830 --> 03:04:07.433]  We know God's there, that's real, you know, but this is like an alien take.
[03:04:07.833 --> 03:04:09.535]  I mean, you really sit back and watch this.
[03:04:09.895 --> 03:04:13.158]  Looks like our establishment's doing everything they can to hurt humans and bring this in.
[03:04:13.697 --> 03:04:21.921]  Well, there's credible speculation that some of the technology transfer actually came from non-Earth, non-human sources, okay?
[03:04:22.301 --> 03:04:24.562]  And that actually begins with the transistor.
[03:04:25.503 --> 03:04:26.563]  You know, late, I think, 1940s.
[03:04:26.663 --> 03:04:30.265]  They don't have to land in a flying saucer, they just transmit it.
[03:04:31.355 --> 03:04:34.355]   the blueprints well i mean that there's there's a lot of credible speculation
[03:04:34.355 --> 03:04:37.515]   i'm not an expert in this area but many people believe that you know technology
[03:04:37.515 --> 03:04:41.315]   was recovered from alien crash sites and then that technology was reverse
[03:04:41.315 --> 03:04:46.075]   engineered which sounds like the script from you know terminator but it's
[03:04:46.075 --> 03:04:50.074]   actually credible and because there were great leaps in technology the transistor
[03:04:50.074 --> 03:04:54.074]   being one of them was actually based on a quantum phenomenon by the way and then
[03:04:54.074 --> 03:04:57.034]   the transistors being able to be manufactured and packed in to the point
[03:04:57.034 --> 03:05:02.194]   where we have these high-density cpus and gpus today but large language models
[03:05:02.194 --> 03:05:08.931]   or neural network processing Is something that has emergent properties that even its creators did not anticipate.
[03:05:09.332 --> 03:05:14.077]  So the emergent property of it being able to write poetry, you know, that wasn't anticipated.
[03:05:14.438 --> 03:05:22.547]  Or to be able to write a letter, you know, you can ask it like, hey, write a letter, you know, to my business partner to propose that they buy 100,000 units of this or whatever.
[03:05:23.288 --> 03:05:25.009]  That was never supposed to happen.
[03:05:25.429 --> 03:05:34.375]  The machine learning people were surprised that it could complete sentences and write letters, but now that's considered an everyday thing.
[03:05:34.415 --> 03:05:36.916]  Now it's writing Hollywood scripts.
[03:05:37.496 --> 03:05:45.061]  There's no way for human beings to properly anticipate the leaps that this technology is going to take, including potentially a leap into sentience.
[03:05:45.781 --> 03:05:47.242]  And that's where Skynet begins.
[03:05:49.170 --> 03:06:06.499]  And also, there are some people who believe that OpenAI, you know, with Sam Altman and the recent shenanigans that happened there, they think that the OpenAI system took such a leap, or there was evidence of it, and as a result, people freaked out, and there was a debate about whether that should be released into the open world or not.
[03:06:06.599 --> 03:06:09.761]  So, I don't know how much of that is true versus rumors.
[03:06:09.781 --> 03:06:12.102]  Well, they admitted they warned the board, and they fired them.
[03:06:12.722 --> 03:06:12.882]  Yeah.
[03:06:12.922 --> 03:06:13.583]  And they brought him right back.
[03:06:13.603 --> 03:06:14.344]  And they brought him back.
[03:06:14.885 --> 03:06:15.085]  Right.
[03:06:15.285 --> 03:06:24.215]  And the accusation, as I understand it, is that Sam Altman wanted to commercialize this information very rapidly, or this technology rapidly, but other people were more cautious.
[03:06:24.956 --> 03:06:27.319]  And I don't know if that's true, but at least it's something to consider.
[03:06:27.639 --> 03:06:28.860]  Well, Mike, powerful.

[03:06:41.866 --> 03:06:42.766]  This is a crazy world.
[03:06:42.807 --> 03:06:43.367]  Don't give up.
[03:06:43.387 --> 03:06:44.687]  There's a nuclear war and AI.
[03:06:44.707 --> 03:06:46.528]  This is going to be an incredible journey together.
[03:06:46.568 --> 03:06:47.409]  Please keep us on air.
[03:06:47.689 --> 03:06:48.249]  Great products.

[03:06:49.270 --> 03:06:51.191]  60-second closing comment, Mike Adams.
[03:06:51.491 --> 03:06:51.711]  All right.
[03:06:51.731 --> 03:06:55.573]  Well, the bottom line, folks, is you are important to the future of humanity.
[03:06:56.021 --> 03:06:59.624]  And it's like Alex says, if you're receiving this message, you are the resistance.
[03:06:59.684 --> 03:07:10.232]  And in more ways than you can possibly understand, the fact that you have human cognition and the gifts of God, of first-person perspective, compassion, a soul, consciousness.
[03:07:10.672 --> 03:07:11.573]  Recognizing beauty.
[03:07:11.853 --> 03:07:12.334]  Absolutely.
[03:07:12.654 --> 03:07:14.696]  This is what will set you apart from the rest.
[03:07:15.536 --> 03:07:17.058]  You see a sunset, it's beautiful.
[03:07:17.098 --> 03:07:17.618]  What is that?
[03:07:17.778 --> 03:07:21.522]  You just... Yeah, or love, compassion, empathy for fellow human beings.
[03:07:21.542 --> 03:07:27.707]  These are the things that define you as being human, and these are the things that you can never let go of, otherwise we lose human civilization.
[03:07:28.008 --> 03:07:30.290]  Alright, have you put a big report out yet on Natural News?
[03:07:31.611 --> 03:07:35.495]  Yeah, I made a partial transcript of my coverage of this, but the big stuff was right here today.
[03:07:36.158 --> 03:07:38.239]  All right, so this is going to break the next few days at nationalnews.com.
[03:07:38.399 --> 03:07:40.280]  Yeah, we'll repost this on my site, yeah.
[03:07:40.560 --> 03:07:43.081]  But I know you're right.
[03:07:43.201 --> 03:07:44.382]  This is amazing.
[03:07:44.402 --> 03:07:45.563]  Thanks for sharing this with us.
[03:07:45.983 --> 03:07:46.583]  Mike Adams.
[03:07:47.364 --> 03:07:50.485]  Owen Schroer is on an airplane to be on Tim Pool tonight.
[03:07:50.965 --> 03:07:55.848]  Chase Geiser is going to be doing a great job coming here in about three minutes with The War Room and fullwars.com forward slash show.
[03:07:56.648 --> 03:07:58.429]  I want to thank all of you for your support.
[03:07:58.469 --> 03:07:59.850]  Thank the great group for all their work.
[03:08:00.290 --> 03:08:02.051]  And thank Mike Adams for what he's done here.
[03:08:02.372 --> 03:08:03.572]  Be sure to go to NationalNews.com.
[03:08:03.592 --> 03:08:08.395]  You can find us at RealAlexJonesNow on X and Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:08:08.596 --> 03:08:11.237]  And make no mistake, it's an incredible time to be alive.
[03:08:11.677 --> 03:08:12.518]  So exciting.
[03:08:13.218 --> 03:08:13.859]  It's amazing.
[03:08:14.219 --> 03:08:19.242]  Thank you so much for tuning in to this live Friday, December 15th, 2023 broadcast.
[03:08:21.192 --> 03:08:23.658]  And I'll be back Sunday night, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:08:23.698 --> 03:08:25.602]  I'll probably come in tomorrow and do something special as well.
[03:08:25.983 --> 03:08:29.932]  I'm doing a special broadcast on X tonight.
[03:08:31.974 --> 03:08:34.135]  I've been on air close to 30 years.
[03:08:34.955 --> 03:08:44.637]  And going back more than, wow, 15 years ago, we began to get massively censored and debanked and harassed in different ways by the globalist deep state.
[03:08:45.317 --> 03:08:52.879]  So when their total censorship and tyranny arrived, the last five years, we were ready to resist it as best as we could.
[03:08:53.559 --> 03:08:58.105]  So, Nietzsche's definitely right that that which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[03:08:58.665 --> 03:09:04.985]   But really it's been God working through the audience of viewers and listeners who've been steadfast supporters,
[03:09:04.985 --> 03:09:10.465]   spreading the word, praying for us, buying the product, sharing the clips, the articles, the videos.
[03:09:10.465 --> 03:09:15.985]   It has really allowed us to survive and when it comes to exposing the globalists thrive.
[03:09:15.985 --> 03:09:20.825]   So as Christmas approaches 2023, I wanted to take some time out to say that I'm thankful
[03:09:20.825 --> 03:09:23.145]  for all the viewers and listeners.
[03:09:23.145 --> 03:09:26.985]   And I meet you all over the streets of Austin and all over the country and all over the world.
[03:09:26.985 --> 03:09:29.344]  And I really love you and I appreciate you.
[03:09:29.344 --> 03:09:36.585]   And because they started taking our sponsors away from us more than 15 years ago, we began to move away from sponsors
[03:09:36.585 --> 03:09:40.585]  and sell products directly to the population.
[03:09:40.816 --> 03:09:44.959]  And we always went out and tried to find hot, cool products that already had great reviews.
[03:09:45.479 --> 03:09:46.940]  That way we knew we were selling a good product.
[03:09:47.040 --> 03:09:47.920]  I would try them out myself.
[03:09:48.541 --> 03:09:53.544]  And over the last 15 years, we've gotten really, really good at bringing you amazing products.
[03:09:54.264 --> 03:09:56.066]  And now, we have the best books.
[03:09:56.846 --> 03:10:03.657]  The best films, really everything we saw on the site is very high quality, but at a very, very competitive price.
[03:10:04.078 --> 03:10:05.360]  Whether it's the storeable foods...
[03:10:06.288 --> 03:10:16.192]  Whether it's the water filtration, whether it's the supplements, whether it's the books, the films, they're amongst the very, very best, and you're funding an operation fighting the globalists.
[03:10:16.752 --> 03:10:22.334]  So even if you bought this stuff at a big box store whose owners are anti-freedom, anti-human, you'd still be getting a great product.
[03:10:22.694 --> 03:10:29.618]   But when you buy these products from us, you are supporting an organization An operation that's not submitting to tyranny.
[03:10:29.958 --> 03:10:36.402]  So we kind of created the model of a political talk show funding itself with direct sales.
[03:10:36.522 --> 03:10:40.124]  And now more and more are doing it because they've been censored, they've been shut down.
[03:10:40.224 --> 03:10:48.229]  So for all the years we've been fighting together, I want to thank all the InfoWars viewers and listeners, the InfoWars family, because we're still here because of you.
[03:10:48.670 --> 03:10:57.466]   And now Christmas 2023 is here, and we have the biggest sales of the year every Christmas, and a lot of products that have been sold out are now back in stock.
[03:10:58.046 --> 03:11:05.468]  I'm happy to announce we have storewide free shipping, double Patreon points, 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip on your next order.
[03:11:05.508 --> 03:11:08.608]  That way, stuff that's sold out is held back for you, so it's not sold out.
[03:11:09.168 --> 03:11:12.369]  And up to 60% off on these best-selling products.
[03:11:12.489 --> 03:11:19.091]  And finally, TurboForce, 10 hours of clean energy is finally back in stock.
[03:11:19.771 --> 03:11:27.414]  The top of the line, the strongest, the Godzilla of nootropics, of energy, of brain boost, turbo force back in stock.
[03:11:27.994 --> 03:11:31.155]  X2, sold out for more than a year, got a limited supply in.
[03:11:31.575 --> 03:11:33.496]  Unfortunately, it's about to sell out.
[03:11:33.816 --> 03:11:40.678]  Despite that, we've got it at 25% off, but it's going to go to full price before Christmas hits, so take advantage of that right now.
[03:11:41.078 --> 03:11:50.990]  We also have Down and Out Sleep Support, a whole bunch of natural, known, strong, organic compounds that give you deep, restful sleep that's so good for your immune system, your body, everything.
[03:11:51.250 --> 03:11:55.195]  Real Red Pill Plus, Vitamineral Fusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[03:11:56.115 --> 03:11:59.276]  It's all there at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:11:59.296 --> 03:12:00.456]  You can also call toll-free.
[03:12:00.516 --> 03:12:07.617]  If you'd like to order that way, 888-253-3139.
