[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.359]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.199]  InfoWars.
[00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:29.442]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:38.722]  today.
[00:00:38.786 --> 00:00:39.086]  I think.
[00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:39.967]  Just let me think.
[00:00:40.047 --> 00:00:45.249]  Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:46.129]  It's Chancellor Suttler.
[00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:47.170]  Damn it!
[00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.490]  Why?
[00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:54.414]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:57.858]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[00:01:02.264 --> 00:01:05.705]  There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:06.705]  You designed it, sir.
[00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:07.686]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:09.146]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:11.447]  Cruelty and injustice.
[00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:12.807]  Intolerance and oppression.
[00:01:13.247 --> 00:01:22.650]  And where once you had the freedom to object and to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.050]  Cameras.
[00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.790]  We need cameras.
[00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.810]  How did this happen?
[00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:26.311]  Who's to blame?
[00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:29.933]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:01:29.953 --> 00:01:31.854]  They will be held accountable.
[00:01:31.874 --> 00:01:37.738]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:01:38.954 --> 00:01:40.755]  I know why you did it.
[00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:42.016]  I know you were afraid.
[00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:43.176]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:01:43.677 --> 00:01:44.097]  War?
[00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:44.817]  Terror?
[00:01:45.057 --> 00:01:45.718]  Disease?
[00:01:46.378 --> 00:01:52.741]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:58.564]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:05.984]   He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:02:05.984 --> 00:02:13.985]  There is a war.
[00:02:13.764 --> 00:02:14.745]  It's happening now.
[00:02:15.645 --> 00:02:17.446]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:19.787]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:02:20.568 --> 00:02:22.029]  We are the Resistance.
[00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.289]  We are the InfoWar.
[00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:37.289]  [Music]
[00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:43.289]   Ladies and gentlemen, a historic announcement today, taking the deep state on head on.
[00:02:43.965 --> 00:02:44.306]  Wow!
[00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:45.847]  It is Tuesday, August 8th, 2023.
[00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:54.072]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas at Stephen Crowder's incredible studios.
[00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:58.415]  They have just launched a new network system partnered with Rumble.
[00:02:58.975 --> 00:03:03.838]  His show is routinely hitting 5 million viewers a day on one channel alone.
[00:03:03.898 --> 00:03:04.919]  This is explosive.
[00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:14.841]  And I'm going to start a weekly show with them, and then I'm going to expand into Infowars and so much more with investigative crews on the streets, our reporters going all over the world.
[00:03:15.021 --> 00:03:17.642]  This is a match made in heaven.
[00:03:18.342 --> 00:03:22.563]  So I'm going to have Steven Crowder and others coming up in studio.
[00:03:23.163 --> 00:03:27.564]  Amazing comedian Nick DiPaolo and so many others.
[00:03:27.604 --> 00:03:33.750]   We're also going to have the CEO, who's a really smart guy, of Steven Crowder's operation in Mug Club.
[00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.631]  We're going to be having Gerald Morgan in here with us in the first hour.
[00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:39.332]  It is going to be absolutely huge.
[00:03:39.412 --> 00:03:47.076]  And coming up next segment, they had an amazing hour 15-minute press conference this morning that just ended about 35 minutes ago.
[00:03:47.136 --> 00:03:51.958]  We're going to air about 15 minutes of that with Steven Crowder and myself making some big announcements.
[00:03:53.018 --> 00:03:59.110]   And then we're going to have Steven and some of the crew Brian Kellen, who I've known for many years and one of the top comedians out there.
[00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.412]  Just hung out with him and Joe Rogan and had dinner on Saturday and went and saw a show on Friday in Austin.
[00:04:04.012 --> 00:04:05.113]  He has signed up here.
[00:04:05.153 --> 00:04:08.074]  So have the Hodge twins and so much more.
[00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:13.957]  And it was Steven Crowder back when everybody turned their back on me pretty much during the platforming other than Tucker Carlson that stood up for me.
[00:04:14.537 --> 00:04:18.199]  And he didn't shut down during the first lockdown, the first days of that.
[00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.020]  So he's the type of guy I want to work with.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.502]  I love the energy, the intelligence of these folks.
[00:04:24.082 --> 00:04:28.825]  And this is a teaming up of InfoWars and Alex Jones and my crew with their crew.
[00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:30.366]  So it is definitely exciting.
[00:04:30.526 --> 00:04:32.307]  But remember, it's you though the main crew.
[00:04:32.567 --> 00:04:33.828]  When you get excited, nothing stops.
[00:04:33.848 --> 00:04:34.568]  You tell everybody you know.
[00:04:34.888 --> 00:04:43.293]  Tune in now to InfoWars.com forward slash show and those local AM and FM stations that are amazing picking us up and the cable and TV stations to tell folks history is happening now.
[00:04:43.313 --> 00:04:46.435]  We have a patriot pro-America communication system.
[00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:48.300]  We are unstoppable.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.744]  If we don't have that, they're going to continue to rule over this country, the deep state.
[00:04:53.124 --> 00:04:59.069]  You saw that, the intelligence agencies, the censorship, the surveillance that I told you about years ago, now all admitted in Congress the last few months.
[00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.654]  Humanity is striking back in the info war, and this is such a historic moment to be alive.
[00:05:05.694 --> 00:05:09.738]  We're going to go to break for one minute, join a lot of radio stations and TV stations that join us at six after.
[00:05:10.078 --> 00:05:11.719]  We're going to go to excerpts of the press conference.
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.401]  It's Tuesday, August 8th.
[00:05:16.303 --> 00:05:23.087]  2023, historic developments in the fight for free speech and the restoration of our republic, 1776, worldwide.
[00:05:23.107 --> 00:05:31.592]  And I think the best way to lay out what's just happened is to air 15 minutes from the hour and a half long incredible press conference that just ended about 35-40 minutes ago.
[00:05:32.973 --> 00:05:35.876]  Here in North Texas at Steven Crowder's Incredible Studios.
[00:05:36.196 --> 00:05:37.898]  They plan to bring on hundreds of hosts.
[00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:40.020]  They have dozens of people on air.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.024]  They're reaching six, seven million people every day.
[00:05:44.484 --> 00:05:48.568]  This is the biggest thing out there already and it is about to explode.
[00:05:48.868 --> 00:05:50.189]  The system fears this.
[00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.571]  They're scared of this.
[00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:53.172]  InfoWars is going anywhere.
[00:05:53.192 --> 00:06:03.637]   This is InfoWars teaming up with Steven Crowder and his incredible operation for reporters on the ground, investigative reports, just a massive expansion in the fight against tyranny.
[00:06:03.657 --> 00:06:06.478]  Instead of just hanging on, we are going to thrive.
[00:06:06.518 --> 00:06:07.999]  You either thrive or you implode.
[00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:13.522]  Well, we are going on the offense because if the globalists want to fight, we're not sure how this is going to end.
[00:06:13.602 --> 00:06:16.343]  But if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one.
[00:06:16.363 --> 00:06:20.125]  So we're about to air some of the press conference today.
[00:06:21.045 --> 00:06:23.367]  Everybody should go to lateralwithcrowder.com.
[00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:25.468]  Everybody should go there right now.
[00:06:25.868 --> 00:06:56.186]   If people want to see the new three-hour podcast I'm going to start every week and it's going to expand to every day with the regular InfoWars show and so much more, you should go and sign up right now at jonescrowder.com and you get a free month for all the shows with Steven Crowder and all the other programs that are being launched and the Hodge Twins and more and then that builds the infrastructure because imagine Imagine if instead of just a boycott, $40-something billion that Anheuser-Busch lost with the Bud Light thing, imagine a billion-dollar boycott.
[00:06:56.206 --> 00:07:00.047]  Hey folks, if $50 million comes in, this'll dwarf everything.
[00:07:00.327 --> 00:07:02.527]  This'll dwarf all the other networks, Daily Wire, all of it.
[00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:07.809]  But it's not about competition, it's about the other conservative networks aren't going 20% of the way.
[00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:11.789]  We're going all the way to bring down the New World Order with tomorrow's news today.
[00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:19.369]   So go to jonescrowder.com, jonescrowder.com, and we'll put that on screen later, jonescrowder.com.
[00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:24.248]   And that takes you right to the sub page at ladderwithcrowder.com/mugclub,
[00:07:24.248 --> 00:07:26.129]  where you get the free month.
[00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:29.049]   They got a bunch of other specials, a bunch of other deals there as well.
[00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:30.648]  So be sure and take advantage of that.
[00:07:30.648 --> 00:07:32.209]  It takes money to fight a war.
[00:07:32.209 --> 00:07:38.369]   You want us to fight hard and go to Bilderberg and go to Bohemian Grove and go to all the other big events.
[00:07:38.936 --> 00:07:44.799]  You want us to go to the DNC, the RNC, reporters on the border.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.580]  You want us to go to the Deimos Group.
[00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:47.961]  We're going to do it.
[00:07:48.502 --> 00:07:49.822]  And this is the next level.
[00:07:49.842 --> 00:07:51.584]  I want to salute the info warriors out there.
[00:07:51.644 --> 00:08:04.213]   Go to jonescrowder.com now and be The front line patriots, the first to sign up for like $7 a month to build this next level infrastructure with Rumble.
[00:08:04.533 --> 00:08:05.394]  It's not censoring.
[00:08:05.674 --> 00:08:07.396]  We're already having incredible success.
[00:08:07.436 --> 00:08:08.376]  I salute Steven Crowder.
[00:08:08.657 --> 00:08:09.878]  Here's part of the press conference today.
[00:08:09.898 --> 00:08:12.800]  We'll be back with Steven Crowder and some of his other crew in studio.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.620]  Stay with us.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:22.620]  [MUSIC]
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.620]   Have you been compromising day in and day out when no compromise is necessary?
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.620]  [MUSIC]
[00:08:31.757 --> 00:08:32.617]  And I'll go one further.
[00:08:33.058 --> 00:08:37.660]  Where no compromise should ever be expected from you.
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.540]  It is time to match intensity.
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:52.659]   Every single one of you watching or listening right now needs to flip a switch in your head
[00:08:52.659 --> 00:09:02.260]   where you will make those sons of bitches embarrassed that they ever even thought of asking that compromise.
[00:09:02.526 --> 00:09:06.128]  Imagine the founding fathers looking down and going, what the fuck are you people doing?
[00:09:06.148 --> 00:09:12.071]  You're talking about the same people that rail against misinformation, who platform Adam Schiff.
[00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:14.913]  This case needs to be blown up and the ATF needs to be held accountable.
[00:09:15.092 --> 00:09:22.092]  Why can't we not condemn evil behavior?
[00:09:22.092 --> 00:09:44.771]   Of comedy specials, we have new shows, the investigative unit, which we've discussed
[00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.232]  And again, you get a free shirt at ladoscreditor.com slash Mug Club.
[00:09:47.252 --> 00:09:51.835]  But we have another announcement to make regarding a new acquisition here.
[00:09:51.915 --> 00:09:54.037]  And by the way, I'll be taking your chats here after this.
[00:09:54.077 --> 00:09:58.841]  We'll be taking some questions from the press, so you can send your chats in right now on Mug Club.
[00:09:59.081 --> 00:10:01.903]  And we'll be releasing more information regarding some of the developments.
[00:10:02.604 --> 00:10:06.025]   But this is one that we're all Pretty excited about.
[00:10:06.726 --> 00:10:10.268]  And again, if it was just business, it wouldn't make sense.
[00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:24.135]  This is a man who was removed from the platforms of Apple, Spotify, Google, Facebook, Meta, X, whatever the hell it is, all on the same day.
[00:10:24.435 --> 00:10:25.456]  But there's no coordination.
[00:10:25.476 --> 00:10:27.377]  It's just coincidence.
[00:10:28.746 --> 00:10:31.727]  And there were, by the way, many people back then who said, well, that's just him.
[00:10:32.448 --> 00:10:33.328]  He's too extreme.
[00:10:33.828 --> 00:10:34.829]  That's just an isolated case.
[00:10:34.869 --> 00:10:35.649]  It won't happen to me.
[00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:38.350]  Well, are you paying attention now?
[00:10:40.991 --> 00:10:48.255]  And so people who we all expect to stand in the line of fire, who are supposed to be brothers in arms, tucked tail and ran.
[00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:55.738]  They struck plea bargains with the platforms who, for a period of time, would punish anyone who even hosted him as a guest.
[00:10:57.258 --> 00:10:58.239]  This is the canary in the coal mine.
[00:10:59.963 --> 00:11:03.404]  These people at these big tech platforms, they tell you that they'll never come for you.
[00:11:03.885 --> 00:11:13.489]  That you can keep your tens of millions in revenue, or millions that you make from their platforms, and really all that means is that if you're lucky, really lucky, they'll kill you last.
[00:11:14.429 --> 00:11:17.490]  Well, they tried to kill this next man first.
[00:11:18.911 --> 00:11:21.232]  And if he's honest, he'll tell you, they almost did.
[00:11:21.252 --> 00:11:23.613]  They did a lot of damage.
[00:11:24.622 --> 00:11:33.867]  But if there's one thing you can say about this man, love him or hate him, is that he will fight for this country with every last breath in his body, and he just won't die.
[00:11:34.687 --> 00:11:50.936]  So it's with as much pride that I can convey, and as much surprise, by the way, as you, in landing this white whale, the number one draft pick, without a doubt, out there, that for the first time he will launch his subscription network exclusively under the Mug Club umbrella, starting with his new Friday show.
[00:11:51.798 --> 00:12:05.044]  On August 18th, ladies and gentlemen... I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:12:06.824 --> 00:12:10.424]   Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns,
[00:12:10.424 --> 00:12:13.224]  Manel Castro took the guns, Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[00:12:13.224 --> 00:12:18.984]  And if you try to take our guns, 1776 will commence again.
[00:12:18.984 --> 00:12:25.304]   Sticking with Facebook, it is one of several companies today
[00:12:25.304 --> 00:12:28.343]  that are limiting the content of far-right podcasts.
[00:12:28.495 --> 00:12:34.460]  InfoWars, Facebook, Apple, and YouTube have all taken down content from Jones and his InfoWars channel.
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.443]  Whenever I talk about Alex Jones, my wife will not let me into the house until I've been deloused.
[00:12:38.803 --> 00:12:43.787]  Anyone who believes in Alex Jones and believes these theories, you really gotta go get help.
[00:12:43.726 --> 00:12:48.726]  Alex Jones has been ordered to pay 965 million dollars.
[00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:53.726]  Look how they've removed the control information.
[00:12:53.671 --> 00:12:54.572]  There's always been.
[00:12:54.992 --> 00:12:59.035]  And it ought to scare people that you've got a move to indoctrinate the children of America.
[00:12:59.315 --> 00:13:03.578]  If they can get you to be part of a group, an environmentalist or part of your minority group.
[00:13:03.598 --> 00:13:08.481]  Black, Latino, and indigenous people are suffering and dying disproportionately.
[00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:11.583]  The most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland is white supremacy.
[00:13:11.603 --> 00:13:15.726]  They'll have their little tailor-made people that they're bought and paid for to claim to be your leaders.
[00:13:16.287 --> 00:13:18.748]  We're looking at a giant war in February right now.
[00:13:19.068 --> 00:13:21.068]  Currently, that's the projection.
[00:13:21.068 --> 00:13:26.068]  [Music]
[00:13:26.068 --> 00:13:33.478]   There's an entire agenda afoot to force the population to undergo different type of medical treatments, namely
[00:13:33.478 --> 00:13:34.068]  vaccines.
[00:13:34.068 --> 00:13:36.068]  In 2008...
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:46.487]  In 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World Order, pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society.
[00:13:46.787 --> 00:13:48.728]  If any terrorism comes, it's from this government.
[00:13:49.128 --> 00:14:00.558]  And if there was an outside threat like a Bin Laden, who was a known CIS in the 80s, running the Mujahideen War, whose family builds all the military bases over in Saudi Arabia right now, this is the board of Iridium Satellite.
[00:14:00.778 --> 00:14:03.080]  He's the boogeyman they need.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.241]  I've been shadowbanned.
[00:14:05.042 --> 00:14:06.343]  I've been called a liar.
[00:14:07.064 --> 00:14:10.386]  I've been silenced on virtually every platform created by man.
[00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:14.070]  My life has been threatened, repeatedly.
[00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.652]  They've tried to destroy me, but I survived.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.303]  And that's why I'm joining Mug Club.
[00:14:24.448 --> 00:14:27.448]  Alex Jones, everybody!
[00:14:27.448 --> 00:14:39.448]  [applause]
[00:14:39.448 --> 00:14:40.448]  Thank you.
[00:14:40.596 --> 00:14:41.797]  Listen, I want to thank everybody tuning in.
[00:14:41.817 --> 00:14:45.341]  I want to thank everybody tuning in right now, but I want to be deadly serious here.
[00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:47.663]  I've not been this excited ever!
[00:14:47.824 --> 00:14:50.066]  Yeah, Mud Club, baby!
[00:14:50.286 --> 00:14:50.827]  Wow!
[00:14:53.473 --> 00:14:55.114]  I've known Steven for more than 10 years.
[00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:56.755]  Used to, you know, beg him to come on my show.
[00:14:56.795 --> 00:14:57.936]  Always a really busy guy.
[00:14:58.056 --> 00:14:59.496]  And he's been a bit of a popper forever.
[00:15:00.937 --> 00:15:01.938]  But we kind of knew each other.
[00:15:02.158 --> 00:15:06.100]  But as soon as I got the platform, he saw as a threat and he said, I want you on immediately.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:11.963]  The day after, when everybody else was running away, including my friends, he was like, no, this is a danger to everybody.
[00:15:12.023 --> 00:15:12.764]  I see what this is.
[00:15:13.564 --> 00:15:16.327]  And then again, everybody else was shutting down during the lockdown.
[00:15:16.347 --> 00:15:17.008]  I didn't.
[00:15:17.228 --> 00:15:17.588]  He didn't.
[00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:20.772]  And so it's that type of instinctive courage that I really respect.
[00:15:20.792 --> 00:15:22.814]  We've become good friends the last three or four years.
[00:15:22.854 --> 00:15:24.596]  Since then, I love coming up here.
[00:15:24.616 --> 00:15:25.237]  I love the energy.
[00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:38.634]   And let's be clear, InfoWars isn't going anywhere or Austin Operation, my regular show that's on talk radio everywhere, but We've been talking for years about some type of collaboration and he had to move from where he was to trailblaze and do this.
[00:15:39.415 --> 00:15:41.276]  And what's incredible is it's succeeding.
[00:15:41.617 --> 00:15:42.317]  But here's the key.
[00:15:43.018 --> 00:15:47.341]  We don't just have the left and the globalist and big tech and the intelligence agencies.
[00:15:47.782 --> 00:15:57.189]  We now know that we're censoring and controlling and suppressing election information and vaccine information and open border and human trafficking information, fentanyl info and Afghan withdrawal info.
[00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:14.258]   It's the big think tanks that Crowder alluded to earlier that are so-called conservative that have billions of dollars over the last decade to buy and control the populist, nationalist, common-sense capitalist movement that this country was founded on that met at the apple of the world's eye.
[00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:21.162]  And so we're not just challenging the left and Hollywood and big tech, we're challenging Conservative Inc.
[00:16:21.182 --> 00:16:31.089]   And that didn't make sense to some people that weren't You know, clued in or on the inside of what really goes on six months ago when Crowder was making a big deal about the other big conservative platforms that aren't conservative.
[00:16:31.329 --> 00:16:41.017]  They interface with YouTube and Facebook and before Twitter was sold to Musk and literally sit around in smoky rooms laughing at the conservatives.
[00:16:41.337 --> 00:16:41.998]  And I've been around it.
[00:16:42.058 --> 00:16:46.902]  It's disgusting to people that have authenticity like Steven Crowder and this incredible crew.
[00:16:47.502 --> 00:16:48.803]  These are real people.
[00:16:48.863 --> 00:16:50.485]  No, these are real people right here.
[00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:57.912]  Harold Morgan, all of these comedians, all these people have turned down tens of millions of dollars to tell the truth.
[00:16:58.552 --> 00:17:04.714]  I mean, there's people out there like Ted Nugent lost probably a hundred million dollars the last six, seven years supporting Trump.
[00:17:04.734 --> 00:17:05.334]  It's been in the news.
[00:17:05.574 --> 00:17:07.275]  Just no more stadiums, no more nothing.
[00:17:07.935 --> 00:17:08.975]  It's over for him.
[00:17:09.015 --> 00:17:10.496]  So there's not many people like that.
[00:17:10.516 --> 00:17:11.896]  Probably should bring Ted Nugent over here.
[00:17:14.157 --> 00:17:17.740]  What I'm getting down to is we need an independent network that isn't controlled.
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:24.704]  And I'm sorry, Twitter is better than some of the other so-called conservative or open platforms, but it's still not even halfway free.
[00:17:25.304 --> 00:17:29.007]  Yeah, halfway free feels better than no free, and I'm not even criticizing Twitter.
[00:17:29.087 --> 00:17:30.368]  It's just, it's just not free.
[00:17:30.808 --> 00:17:37.492]  So many really effective people that expose Communist China and certain owners of Twitter's connection to it, they're all still censored.
[00:17:38.353 --> 00:17:42.113]   not Mug Club. And I know the plan that Crowder has, he's told me about it, he's told you
[00:17:42.113 --> 00:17:46.313]   a lot about it, is to literally bring on hundreds of providers, and I guess in the long term
[00:17:46.313 --> 00:17:51.432]   even thousands, and then use the great folks at Rumble that really are free and open to
[00:17:51.432 --> 00:17:55.513]   energize this. So people always say, "Hey, if you want your own internet, why don't you
[00:17:55.513 --> 00:17:59.513]   build it? Or you want your own platform, build it." Well, it's very hard to do, but he's
[00:17:59.513 --> 00:18:03.793]   been able to do it because of you, the Mug Club members, and that gives him that independence.
[00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:07.278]  So you literally aren't just the tail of the dog, you're the whole shoot match.
[00:18:07.298 --> 00:18:15.264]  You're the whole dog, the teeth, the brain, you know, the feet, the guts, the heart, the brain, the eyes and ears with the investigative unit and everything.
[00:18:15.524 --> 00:18:19.467]  You are this operation, and if you get excited about this, it's game over for the New World Order.
[00:18:19.788 --> 00:18:22.988]   Listen, we came and founded a new country to get away from tyranny.
[00:18:22.988 --> 00:18:26.028]   We weren't perfect, but it became the freest, greatest thing ever.
[00:18:26.028 --> 00:18:31.788]   So it's that the Israelites left Egypt under Ramses II,
[00:18:31.788 --> 00:18:34.867]   and they've now dug up all the tablets and the history, and that's a true story.
[00:18:34.867 --> 00:18:35.707]  It really happened.
[00:18:35.707 --> 00:18:37.788]  It's on the Egyptian hieroglyphs as well.
[00:18:37.788 --> 00:18:40.867]   So Stephen Crowder and the Mug Club and this whole operation
[00:18:40.867 --> 00:18:45.788]   is literally leading everybody out of Egypt, and we don't have to wait 50 years or 40 years
[00:18:45.788 --> 00:18:47.347]  to cross the River Jordan, folks.
[00:18:47.104 --> 00:18:48.205]  We're doing it right now.
[00:18:48.505 --> 00:18:50.606]  It's already launched, out of the gate, successful.
[00:18:50.867 --> 00:18:58.832]  That is a true American success story of dedication, work, not backing down, and it challenges the entire system.
[00:18:58.892 --> 00:19:11.340]  So when this is successful, and it already is, but I mean super successful, it will then be the example to all the other big, so-called conservative, populist talk show hosts who don't like serving the globalists, but are too scared to buck them.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.702]  To let them then have the courage to follow us.
[00:19:15.063 --> 00:19:20.487]  So this is true leadership and history that you're watching right now today.
[00:19:20.527 --> 00:19:21.748]  Now here's another key point.
[00:19:22.268 --> 00:19:28.853]  If you look at the 40 plus billion that Anheuser-Busch has lost with the entire debacle with Bud Light.
[00:19:29.634 --> 00:19:36.439]  That's a great example of us saying we're going to withdraw support of people targeting children and sexualization and this whole transhumanist movement.
[00:19:36.459 --> 00:19:36.920]  That's what it is.
[00:19:37.765 --> 00:19:40.586]  I mean, you all know Harari at the WEF says, oh, this is just the beginning.
[00:19:40.606 --> 00:19:46.608]  If you'll accept two men having a baby, you'll accept cyborgs, all the rest of it, clones, animal-human hybrids, which is all out in the open now.
[00:19:47.129 --> 00:19:49.990]  But instead of just boycotts, what about bycots?
[00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.850]  And that's what this is, folks.
[00:19:52.210 --> 00:20:02.534]  You get all these great shows, all these great memberships, all these great things, and know that you're part of history, bucking the system, American Revolution, 1776, Worldwide 2.0.
[00:20:02.794 --> 00:20:03.955]  So the boycotts are great.
[00:20:04.355 --> 00:20:09.797]  Pull your money out of the globalist system, but then spend it with the institutions and organizations that are standing in freedom.
[00:20:10.597 --> 00:20:17.740]  If Anheuser-Busch just lost, I think the number I saw last week was 41 billion, it just keeps going up and up, 25% market share in all of their products.
[00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:23.582]  Think about what would happen if people spent a billion on Mug Club instead of 10 million or whatever.
[00:20:23.802 --> 00:20:27.285]  Because this guy's putting almost everything back into the operation.
[00:20:27.905 --> 00:20:35.551]  Because it is about the excitement of standing up for liberty and connecting to our forefathers and foremothers that created this country.
[00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:36.731]  And that's what this is about.
[00:20:39.212 --> 00:20:43.316]  Business sense to not roll over and make the hundreds of millions and solve the system.
[00:20:43.356 --> 00:20:46.019]  But wait, if the whole country and the world's gone, that money doesn't matter.
[00:20:46.099 --> 00:20:47.721]  It makes perfect business sense.
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:54.620]   Because our business is prosperity and freedom and justice and Americana 1776 worldwide!
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.620]  [applause]
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.620]  So that's what this is all about.
[00:20:59.664 --> 00:21:04.906]  So we've been talking for six months about doing this, and I said, well, I'm going to keep InfoWars going, the great crew we do.
[00:21:05.486 --> 00:21:07.346]  And they thought, and I said, what's your idea?
[00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:08.427]  And I had mine already written down.
[00:21:08.447 --> 00:21:12.848]  They said, once a week show, build off that, then start building some other shows.
[00:21:13.388 --> 00:21:21.471]  And with the funding we get from this, we'll be able to hire back more reporters, do more investigative stuff on the ground at the border and at Bilderberg and at Davos and at the RNC and DNC.
[00:21:21.511 --> 00:21:22.952]  So this is a match made in heaven.
[00:21:23.452 --> 00:21:28.333]   Everybody Needs to tell your friends, your family, your neighbors, hey, you want a second American Revolution?
[00:21:28.533 --> 00:21:29.333]  You don't like what's happening?
[00:21:29.533 --> 00:21:32.814]  Well, this is the group, this is the organization that is the best there is.
[00:21:33.054 --> 00:21:34.974]  We're not up here saying, you know, we're Superman.
[00:21:34.994 --> 00:21:36.394]  We're not up here saying we have all the answers.
[00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:37.095]  But you know what?
[00:21:37.595 --> 00:21:38.875]  It's not bragging when it's fact.
[00:21:38.975 --> 00:21:50.077]  People need to recognize that this operation with Steven Crowder and his crew we're doing is the best, open, freest, biggest thing there is in the world in opposition to the New World Order.
[00:21:50.257 --> 00:21:59.140]   And hey, you tune into my show, you're gonna get You're going to get hardcore analysis and over-the-horizon information on what the globalists are planning next.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:21:59.741]  That's all it is.
[00:21:59.761 --> 00:22:00.081]  Study it.
[00:22:00.381 --> 00:22:01.002]  It's hardcore.
[00:22:01.042 --> 00:22:02.224]  Don't slit your wrist after you watch it.
[00:22:02.664 --> 00:22:08.332]  But the good thing is you can then tune in to the incredible, amazing, better-than-the-nighttime comedy shows.
[00:22:09.293 --> 00:22:12.715]  Live delivery of these guys, and they make it fun.
[00:22:12.755 --> 00:22:14.115]  That's why I like the energy here.
[00:22:14.415 --> 00:22:18.257]  It's quite frankly, InfoWars, great crew, great people, but it's like you are in a bunker.
[00:22:18.477 --> 00:22:20.598]  We've been doing it 20-something years, and it's crazy.
[00:22:20.878 --> 00:22:27.081]  So it's a breath of fresh air to just add this family to what's happening, to be part of this organization, and to have the InfoWars crew.
[00:22:27.361 --> 00:22:28.962]  Now you're becoming part of this organization.
[00:22:29.042 --> 00:22:30.523]  I'm just blessed and honored.
[00:22:30.563 --> 00:22:31.103]  It's incredible.
[00:22:31.503 --> 00:22:37.489]  And at 11 a.m., just coming up in about an hour from now, I'll do my live show out of the classic Steven Crowder Studios.
[00:22:37.509 --> 00:22:39.551]  We're going to have these guys in here with us.
[00:22:40.011 --> 00:22:40.812]  It's so exciting.
[00:22:40.832 --> 00:22:41.393]  So, 11 a.m.
[00:22:41.413 --> 00:22:44.556]  Central, InfoWars.com, forward slash show and band out video.
[00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:49.260]  But I want everybody watching, that means on InfoWars everywhere, to be part of this revolutionary act.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.141]  You want resistance?
[00:22:50.381 --> 00:22:51.322]  You want somebody to stand up?
[00:22:51.342 --> 00:22:52.183]  You want somebody to fight?
[00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:54.886]  Go now to the Mug Club.
[00:22:55.226 --> 00:23:00.909]  Go now, ladies and gentlemen, and use the promo codes that are there to get a month off.
[00:23:01.289 --> 00:23:01.869]  Do it now.
[00:23:02.169 --> 00:23:02.930]  Go to Mug Club.
[00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.591]  Take action, because the globalists want war.
[00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:06.752]  They want to destroy us.
[00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:07.472]  Well, guess what?
[00:23:07.512 --> 00:23:08.513]  We didn't start this fight.
[00:23:08.553 --> 00:23:09.113]  We don't want it.
[00:23:09.373 --> 00:23:13.373]  But if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[00:23:13.373 --> 00:23:18.373]  [applause]
[00:23:18.373 --> 00:23:27.373]   Well, the system's definitely scared of this, and I've known Steven Crowder for 10 years.
[00:23:27.399 --> 00:23:28.860]  I'm going to talk about it later in the next segment.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.522]  This is a short segment left here.
[00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:34.685]  Only about four or five minutes left, but this is really next level.
[00:23:34.705 --> 00:23:36.887]  You want somebody to fight, folks, this is it.
[00:23:37.608 --> 00:23:41.071]  And, of course, the great Ryan Talen had to leave and catch an airplane.
[00:23:41.831 --> 00:23:46.916]  He'll be back soon, but Nick DiPaolo, again who Joe Rogan says is one of the top comics in the world, which he is.
[00:23:47.616 --> 00:23:49.758]  The original OG is here with us.
[00:23:50.138 --> 00:23:56.203]  And of course, we have the CEO of Ladder with Crowder, who is just a really good talk show.
[00:23:56.223 --> 00:23:58.986]  He's a smart guy and a wonderful person and a family man.
[00:23:59.006 --> 00:24:02.228]  Of course, we have Mr. Morgan, Joe Morgan here.
[00:24:02.689 --> 00:24:04.530]  And without introduction, we have Steven Crowder.
[00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.472]  So, Steven, only four minutes to break.
[00:24:07.665 --> 00:24:09.227]  I'm getting butterflies which I don't ever get anymore.
[00:24:09.047 --> 00:24:12.106]   This is big what you're doing. Well, I do just watching you speak there
[00:24:12.106 --> 00:24:15.346]   I mean I was on Nick when you were speaking it looks like he was ready to hit somebody just for the sake of
[00:24:15.346 --> 00:24:18.007]   This so you relent this coach. Oh, yeah, it was it was great
[00:24:18.007 --> 00:24:22.066]   But no, this is look we couldn't be more excited about having you here and you're doing this
[00:24:22.066 --> 00:24:26.605]   You know that you're going to be doing the Friday show is People out there getting fatigued with a tip here and a
[00:24:26.605 --> 00:24:38.519]   patreon there and a tip jar here We want to have a network where creators can control their content, have their subscribers not be beholden to corporate overlords or the conservative patsies who do their bidding and so that's where this is.
[00:24:39.439 --> 00:24:40.200]  I don't think there's ever been.
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.421]  I mean, you're the number one draft pick.
[00:24:41.821 --> 00:24:47.325]  So getting you involved with it means, to me, it's a stamp of approval that we're offering something that no one else is.
[00:24:47.365 --> 00:24:48.686]  I can't tell you how excited we are.
[00:24:48.946 --> 00:24:52.689]  Honestly, how moved Gerald and I were that you wanted to be there.
[00:24:52.709 --> 00:24:54.510]  We were going, do you think Alex would want to do something with us?
[00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:55.731]  Because he doesn't really need anybody.
[00:24:56.431 --> 00:24:57.812]  And here we are.
[00:24:58.433 --> 00:25:02.836]  Well, you're the Pat Brady 20 years ago, and I'm kind of like the Roger Stallbeck right before I retired.
[00:25:02.876 --> 00:25:05.658]  But the point is, you're not scared, and everybody else ran.
[00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:07.979]  Everybody else ran, and you supported me.
[00:25:08.019 --> 00:25:12.480]  We were already friends, but not really close friends, but under the pressure, like you said today, that brought us together.
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.101]  I didn't even, like, we were friends.
[00:25:14.261 --> 00:25:15.241]  I didn't even like you that much.
[00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:17.442]  I don't mean I disliked you, but I didn't know you that well.
[00:25:17.482 --> 00:25:18.742]  Well, never mind when you disagree with me.
[00:25:18.762 --> 00:25:19.383]  A lot of times you were right.
[00:25:19.443 --> 00:25:22.524]  Oh, yeah, but no, but I didn't even, but I didn't know you that well, and I was going, wait a second, wait a second.
[00:25:22.784 --> 00:25:26.585]  This guy has some of the most powerful people in the world who, you know, used to use his platform, right?
[00:25:26.825 --> 00:25:28.606]  And then none of them are saying anything.
[00:25:28.686 --> 00:25:35.388]  I felt compelled to have you on immediately, and we knew we would be suspended, but that's something we also talked about is you weren't allowed to be a guest.
[00:25:35.888 --> 00:25:38.290]  And then they changed it and said, OK, he can be a guest, he just can't host.
[00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:39.150]  And so then we had you host.
[00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.052]  And of course, we were suspended because I think it's funny.
[00:25:41.492 --> 00:25:41.832]  No, you're right.
[00:25:41.852 --> 00:25:44.074]  At first, four years ago, I couldn't go on any show.
[00:25:44.094 --> 00:25:44.654]  So you did that.
[00:25:44.934 --> 00:25:52.800]  Well, and that's because being the biggest channel there on YouTube, conservative channel that exists on YouTube there, banning our channel is tantamount to saying no conservatives are welcome.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.861]  So that's one thing that Mug Club really allows us to do.
[00:25:54.901 --> 00:25:59.004]  And we're able to operate within the systems without being beholden to them because we don't make a dime on ads.
[00:25:59.144 --> 00:26:01.145]  So if they suspend us, we go, all right, fine.
[00:26:01.165 --> 00:26:02.126]  We'll be gone for two weeks.
[00:26:02.146 --> 00:26:02.566]  But you know what?
[00:26:02.666 --> 00:26:03.387]  It's worth the risk.
[00:26:03.527 --> 00:26:05.729]  To have Alex on, because people need to see this.
[00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:12.313]  Well, the bottom line is, Elon Musk has jumped on this the last six months, more power to him, but he's like, he's like the diet version.
[00:26:12.333 --> 00:26:18.958]  You guys are really doing it, you've proven it, and once we do this, once we build a conservative populist economy, it's game over.
[00:26:19.218 --> 00:26:19.378]  Yeah.
[00:26:19.618 --> 00:26:20.479]  No, you're exactly right.
[00:26:20.499 --> 00:26:23.040]  It's voting with your dollar.
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.721]  I think your promo code is Alex right now, and people get a month free.
[00:26:26.462 --> 00:26:28.823]  Where is it, Joe, that they're signing up through Alex?
[00:26:28.843 --> 00:26:33.745]  They can go to the main mug club and do it with Alex, or they can go, to make it even easier, to jonescrowder.com.
[00:26:33.785 --> 00:26:35.086]  That redirects them right to the sub page.
[00:26:35.186 --> 00:26:35.666]  Okay, yeah.
[00:26:35.966 --> 00:26:36.146]  Great.
[00:26:36.166 --> 00:26:39.908]  And I'm really excited to see what you're doing there on Friday and see what else you bring over.
[00:26:41.989 --> 00:26:45.491]  We're always at the tease some information out there, but look, this is the only way I know how to do things.
[00:26:46.111 --> 00:26:47.312]  I don't know how to do it any other way.
[00:26:47.332 --> 00:26:51.253]  If we're going to fail, hey, after today, we're going to fail big and we'll fail together.
[00:26:51.273 --> 00:26:51.574]  Don't worry.
[00:26:51.594 --> 00:26:53.274]  But you've already succeeded right away, but here's the thing.
[00:26:55.775 --> 00:26:56.696]  People ask what they can do.
[00:26:56.716 --> 00:26:57.356]  Okay, great.
[00:26:57.796 --> 00:27:00.978]  Don't just boycott, you know, Anheuser-Busch or Bud Light.
[00:27:01.558 --> 00:27:02.018]  Boycott.
[00:27:02.038 --> 00:27:02.798]  It's real simple.
[00:27:03.179 --> 00:27:05.760]  Everyone should go to jonescrowder.com.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.222]  Everybody should go there use promo code Alex.
[00:27:08.242 --> 00:27:09.504]  Everybody should get the free month.
[00:27:10.004 --> 00:27:19.188]   This is a revolution and the infrastructure We're gonna probably come back from break, but all the stuff you're launching We're not against Project Fairtrade, like you said, we love them, but you're going to do that?
[00:27:19.208 --> 00:27:20.089]  You've already been doing it before?
[00:27:21.189 --> 00:27:21.809]  You're going crazy.
[00:27:22.129 --> 00:27:24.429]  Yeah, well, what we have is, again, Mug Club is self-sustaining.
[00:27:24.449 --> 00:27:26.250]  It's a business, but it's not just business.
[00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:33.191]  I hear that all the time, like, hey, it's just business, and that's why people don't really launch when they have hundreds of millions of dollars, their own investigative journalist units.
[00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:41.993]  It's why they don't bring on people like Alex Jones, like Nick DiPaolo, who are the OGs, who are respected by their peers, but they're seen as a liability because they truly are free speech oriented.
[00:27:42.473 --> 00:27:46.314]  Don't be fooled by people who have the veil of freedom and free speech, but they still toe the line.
[00:27:47.114 --> 00:27:48.355]  Nick doesn't, and Alex doesn't.
[00:27:48.395 --> 00:27:50.797]  For all their flaws, you know that they're shooting from the hip.
[00:27:50.817 --> 00:27:55.522]  Well, that's right, and everything's an info war, so the enemy spends billions to try to suppress us.
[00:27:56.622 --> 00:27:57.984]  Only the listeners can jailbreak us.
[00:27:58.024 --> 00:27:58.924]  We'll be right back.
[00:27:58.965 --> 00:28:07.752]  We're back live here at the Steven Crowder Mug Club Studios, somewhere deep in the heart of Texas, and I want to just say something very clearly to viewers and listeners.
[00:28:08.433 --> 00:28:10.875]  I don't hype things that aren't real, okay?
[00:28:10.895 --> 00:28:11.616]  Everybody knows that.
[00:28:12.355 --> 00:28:14.821]  I don't just say things just to hype them like all these bozos.
[00:28:15.262 --> 00:28:16.585]  When I say what Steven Crowder...
[00:28:17.702 --> 00:28:21.343]  and Gerald Morgan and his crew are doing is game-changing.
[00:28:21.343 --> 00:28:22.262]  It is.
[00:28:22.262 --> 00:28:25.222]  What Rumble's doing is game-changing.
[00:28:25.222 --> 00:28:31.663]   It is getting massive percentages of global video traffic and exponentially growing.
[00:28:31.663 --> 00:28:32.502]  It's at 6%.
[00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:33.423]  Sounds small.
[00:28:33.423 --> 00:28:36.061]  Nobody can even crack half a percent compared to YouTube.
[00:28:36.061 --> 00:28:38.522]  At current trend rates of the year, it'll be at 20%.
[00:28:38.522 --> 00:28:40.663]  The system is very, very scared.
[00:28:40.663 --> 00:28:44.462]   Stephen's getting three, four, five million views a day just on his show there.
[00:28:44.462 --> 00:28:48.502]   He's adding all these new shows and putting it all back into bullet infrastructure.
[00:28:48.502 --> 00:28:53.142]   The left is good at massive donations and big corporate funding and ESGs,
[00:28:53.142 --> 00:28:56.382]   and that's why they win even though they're culturally unpopular.
[00:28:56.382 --> 00:29:00.343]   If people simply, instead of boycotting 41 million of Anheuser-Busch,
[00:29:00.343 --> 00:29:01.663]  I'd say more power to you.
[00:29:01.663 --> 00:29:07.022]   Again, if you just spent money on things like memberships at jonescrotter.com to get a free month on...
[00:29:07.052 --> 00:29:08.633]  Not just Stephen's show, but all the other shows.
[00:29:08.673 --> 00:29:11.254]  The new Friday Show on Monday, that's podcast three hours.
[00:29:11.314 --> 00:29:15.256]  Very soon it'll expand to weekly, not just a weekly show, but a daily show.
[00:29:15.577 --> 00:29:17.998]  Got big plans here, but it's like filled with dreams.
[00:29:18.078 --> 00:29:18.998]  If we build it, they will come.
[00:29:19.038 --> 00:29:19.739]  We have built it.
[00:29:20.059 --> 00:29:20.899]  It's very exciting.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.960]  This is dangerous to the globalists.
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:27.863]  So, Stephen Crowder, break this down and also jump in anytime you want, Nick.
[00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:31.766]  Yeah, well, I mean, we just did the, I guess, the replatforming press conference.
[00:29:31.786 --> 00:29:35.930]  And look, replatforming, it's a term that really does hold a lot of meaning for us.
[00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:38.813]  I mean, beforehand, I talked about you, like you're like a battered housewife.
[00:29:38.833 --> 00:29:40.815]  You got removed by all of the platforms in one day.
[00:29:40.835 --> 00:29:44.458]  And no one really talked about, this is clearly not coincidence.
[00:29:44.738 --> 00:29:45.799]  It's clearly not coincidence.
[00:29:45.859 --> 00:29:52.866]  No one called them to the mat, like, wait a second, you all clearly had, this isn't a conspiracy, you all clearly got on the phone, ring, ring, we'll get rid of Alex.
[00:29:53.386 --> 00:29:55.507]  And Tim Cook said it was, he said they all met.
[00:29:55.747 --> 00:29:56.747]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:29:57.387 --> 00:30:08.791]  We know that they did, but there was no place for it, so you had to do what you do now, which is closed circuit, and you still have a massive audience, but there needs to be some restitution where you can also get back in and build a new audience, and that just wasn't available.
[00:30:08.891 --> 00:30:13.653]  Rumble is now making that available, and so when we look to people, we say we want to expand Mug Club, right?
[00:30:14.053 --> 00:30:18.894]  The easiest thing would be to take my ball and go home and write out the contract, but we're saying, okay, who needs to be replatformed?
[00:30:18.914 --> 00:30:20.195]  Who are the voices that need to be heard?
[00:30:20.615 --> 00:30:22.176]  You were at the top of the list, and in comedy.
[00:30:22.556 --> 00:30:28.058]  And people know, ever since I've been having Nick just on the show as a guest back in my den, I was the funniest man alive.
[00:30:28.078 --> 00:30:29.258]  That's what I've always called him.
[00:30:29.398 --> 00:30:31.919]  And by the way, stand-up comics will tell you that.
[00:30:32.339 --> 00:30:35.181]  And this is a guy who, he had to forfeit a lot of gigs.
[00:30:35.221 --> 00:30:40.863]  I mean, the SiriusXM, the tweet that you put out there that got you, is still one of the funniest I've ever read in my life.
[00:30:41.223 --> 00:30:42.843]  I thought it was kind of mild, actually.
[00:30:43.003 --> 00:30:44.444]  It wasn't that bad, but it was funny.
[00:30:44.464 --> 00:30:47.545]  What about the Walmart Plano shooting?
[00:30:47.565 --> 00:30:49.666]  I was, remember the... I don't remember that tweet.
[00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:53.731]  Nor do I remember the shooting.
[00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:54.392]  I don't either.
[00:30:54.412 --> 00:30:55.652]  No, they all sort of bleed together.
[00:30:56.013 --> 00:31:01.076]  No, but he said he's an active shooter and I said it's the first time anybody's in Wal-Mart that had considered an active life.
[00:31:03.374 --> 00:31:06.396]  And that one got a little, my fans are going, ah, that's too early.
[00:31:06.456 --> 00:31:07.356]  I go, that's when it's funny.
[00:31:07.957 --> 00:31:09.057]  It's not funny a year from now.
[00:31:09.157 --> 00:31:11.479]  Exactly, free speech is what's uncomfortable.
[00:31:11.639 --> 00:31:11.799]  Yeah.
[00:31:11.899 --> 00:31:12.339]  Thank you.
[00:31:12.679 --> 00:31:13.920]  Well, especially with comedy, right?
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.841]  I don't know if it was Phyllis Tiller who said it's a rubber-tipped sword.
[00:31:15.881 --> 00:31:17.622]  It's a way to make a point without drawing blood.
[00:31:17.682 --> 00:31:20.343]  Like, if you can laugh about something, you can process it.
[00:31:20.504 --> 00:31:21.784]  And often we're condemned for that.
[00:31:21.884 --> 00:31:22.405]  Like, wait a minute.
[00:31:22.425 --> 00:31:25.106]  Well, they say a jester was the second most powerful person in the kingdom.
[00:31:25.526 --> 00:31:28.448]  Well, especially if it was Danny Kaye, because he was, you know, servicing the king.
[00:31:28.468 --> 00:31:29.949]  Here on radio, fellating.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.582]  Danny Kaye was gay.
[00:31:33.662 --> 00:31:34.582]  Is that it?
[00:31:34.963 --> 00:31:37.665]  We're pushing this rebel network and he quotes Phyllis Diller.
[00:31:37.705 --> 00:31:38.426]  Yes, I know.
[00:31:38.866 --> 00:31:40.228]  I bet I have a Danny Kaye reference.
[00:31:40.288 --> 00:31:41.529]  I have to reach back for that.
[00:31:42.304 --> 00:31:43.645]  I know the glass poppy.
[00:31:43.765 --> 00:31:45.825]  Wasn't he playing doctor with Rock Hudson?
[00:31:45.845 --> 00:31:46.526]  Was that Danny Kaye?
[00:31:46.586 --> 00:31:46.886]  I don't know.
[00:31:48.046 --> 00:31:52.288]  The lineup you've already got, that's obviously going to explode and is already dwarfing.
[00:31:53.068 --> 00:31:58.131]  And I'm not against the other conservative networks, but they're following the orders of YouTube and Facebook on record.
[00:31:58.511 --> 00:31:59.911]  And that's what you exposed six months ago.
[00:31:59.931 --> 00:32:00.712]  That's a big deal.
[00:32:01.012 --> 00:32:05.213]   The conservative basically is just Playing patty cake with the system.
[00:32:05.233 --> 00:32:10.575]  Look, it's fine if you want to make tens of millions of dollars off of YouTube ad revenue if you want to, but there needs to be some alternative.
[00:32:10.615 --> 00:32:14.075]  At least one alternative where some people say, you know what, we're not going to be beholden to that.
[00:32:14.215 --> 00:32:15.176]  And we want to save the country.
[00:32:15.296 --> 00:32:16.016]  Yes, exactly.
[00:32:16.296 --> 00:32:18.676]  Now, there's a place for all different kinds of soldiers.
[00:32:18.756 --> 00:32:20.697]  Some people operate exclusively within those.
[00:32:20.777 --> 00:32:24.798]  Now, to be clear, we still operate within those systems like we're on YouTube, but we're not monetized.
[00:32:24.818 --> 00:32:30.159]  There's a huge difference in the threshold of being allowed on YouTube versus being advertised as friendly.
[00:32:30.339 --> 00:32:32.080]  Yeah, and we get suspended all the time.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:32.880]  All the time.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.282]  Now, that's fine if people want to do it, but there needs to be at least one place where people don't care.
[00:32:37.302 --> 00:32:43.125]  Where people say, no, we're not going to chase that ad revenue because we are supported by people who want this.
[00:32:43.165 --> 00:32:43.605]  Mug Club.
[00:32:43.645 --> 00:32:46.026]  I had a conversation with a guy, actually, at an Airbnb.
[00:32:46.246 --> 00:32:47.187]  This just happened recently.
[00:32:47.647 --> 00:32:49.988]  And he said, I left something there, actually.
[00:32:50.008 --> 00:32:51.349]  He said, hey, let me give it to you.
[00:32:51.369 --> 00:32:52.069]  You need to come pick it up.
[00:32:52.089 --> 00:32:53.109]  I said, oh, wait.
[00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:54.290]  He knew who I was.
[00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:57.872]  And he said, you know, I work at X right here in Texas.
[00:32:58.531 --> 00:32:59.531]  I have all the stuff that I want to say.
[00:32:59.531 --> 00:33:00.531]  Not the former Twitter company.
[00:33:00.531 --> 00:33:01.531]  No, no, not Twitter.
[00:33:01.531 --> 00:33:02.531]  But he said I work at XYZ.
[00:33:02.531 --> 00:33:03.531]  He said, "You know what?
[00:33:03.531 --> 00:33:06.451]   I have stuff that I want to say, but I know that if I put it out there, I'm going to get
[00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:07.451]  fired."
[00:33:07.451 --> 00:33:09.771]   And I said, "See, that's the thing is, we say it so that you...
[00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:10.890]  I don't want you to get fired."
[00:33:11.238 --> 00:33:14.439]  But when you support us, when you join Mud Club, we better say it, right?
[00:33:14.539 --> 00:33:16.580]  We're taking that arrow so that you don't have to.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:26.903]  And if we say, hey, we're going to represent your voice, but instead say, actually, we need this 20 million in revenue from YouTube, so we're not really going to say the things you're afraid to say and get fired, then we're a seller.
[00:33:26.923 --> 00:33:27.703]  That's a betrayal.
[00:33:27.783 --> 00:33:29.544]  So we need to kill the chilling effect.
[00:33:29.924 --> 00:33:30.044]  Yes.
[00:33:30.604 --> 00:33:31.365]  Yeah, we absolutely do.
[00:33:31.385 --> 00:33:38.432]  And the lineup, like you were talking about, we have our show, obviously there's a lot of people who don't know, who aren't members yet, a full hour of additional show, a Friday show.
[00:33:38.732 --> 00:33:44.498]  Nick DiPaolo is on Monday through Thursday, and I can't recommend, if you want someone to talk about unfiltered and funny, 5 p.m.
[00:33:44.558 --> 00:33:44.818]  Eastern.
[00:33:44.858 --> 00:33:51.105]  Now we're adding Brian Callen every week, we're adding Hodgwin's every week, we're adding you every Friday, starting this next week, we have an investigative journalism unit.
[00:33:51.685 --> 00:33:53.386]  We're going to be adding animated series, right?
[00:33:53.406 --> 00:33:59.730]  This is being built from the ground up, so it's a process, but it's responsive to what Mug Club wants.
[00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:00.830]  You've proven it, I've proven it.
[00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:02.271]  We actually do what we say we're going to do.
[00:34:02.871 --> 00:34:06.874]  And again, very soon, I'll just be plain blank with folks, I'm still geared towards syndicated radio.
[00:34:06.894 --> 00:34:07.754]  That's what kept us on air.
[00:34:07.794 --> 00:34:09.055]  We'll probably do three hours a day.
[00:34:09.395 --> 00:34:13.057]  Then fourth hour, commercial three very soon on the Mug Club.
[00:34:13.177 --> 00:34:16.219]  And then we're going to add, a lot of folks will live in Austin, not in Dallas.
[00:34:16.299 --> 00:34:17.339]  We'll add more shows there.
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:18.540]  It's a match made in heaven.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.042]  Yeah, it's whatever it is that you want to do.
[00:34:20.062 --> 00:34:21.803]  Like, it really is, it's a blank canvas.
[00:34:22.144 --> 00:34:23.846]  And yeah, look, the media landscape is changing.
[00:34:23.886 --> 00:34:28.391]  And one thing I will say, look, I've talked to some people out there and I know that, okay, Tucker Carlson, for example, is a free agent.
[00:34:28.831 --> 00:34:30.893]  And I've only had good interactions with Tucker personally.
[00:34:31.733 --> 00:34:34.694]  But there aren't many people who do what you do, or do what Nick does.
[00:34:34.714 --> 00:34:35.954]  That's a very different skill set.
[00:34:35.974 --> 00:34:38.355]  Tucker Carlson has a monologue that he would do for 10-15 minutes, great.
[00:34:38.435 --> 00:34:41.995]  And then, you know, at Fox News you have 20-30 writers, producers.
[00:34:42.396 --> 00:34:46.056]  You sit there, without a net, live, for three hours every day.
[00:34:46.517 --> 00:34:48.997]  And Nick DiPaolo has done that for a long time, broadcasting.
[00:34:49.017 --> 00:34:50.137]  That is a different skill set.
[00:34:50.217 --> 00:34:52.758]  And by the way, it's one that the left is terrified.
[00:34:52.938 --> 00:34:54.860]  Now everything is going towards short snippets.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.280]  You know why?
[00:34:55.561 --> 00:34:57.963]  Because there isn't the same buy-in when it's just an algorithm.
[00:34:58.003 --> 00:35:00.526]  They can control what you see and you're not a fan.
[00:35:00.546 --> 00:35:02.127]  They're scared of the long form.
[00:35:02.167 --> 00:35:04.169]  Don't you love being the counterculture though?
[00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.191]  I love being the rebel.
[00:35:07.673 --> 00:35:08.534]  You know who you put together?
[00:35:08.554 --> 00:35:10.776]  The Oakland Raiders of the 70s.
[00:35:11.236 --> 00:35:12.117]  That's who we are.
[00:35:12.317 --> 00:35:14.119]  John Madden.
[00:35:14.499 --> 00:35:16.301]  And a bunch of guys that nobody wanted.
[00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:18.163]  At big balls.
[00:35:18.223 --> 00:35:18.863]  It ends up winning.
[00:35:19.124 --> 00:35:20.084]  It ends up winning.
[00:35:20.164 --> 00:35:20.805]  Just winning.
[00:35:20.845 --> 00:35:22.106]  That's how I look at it.
[00:35:22.226 --> 00:35:23.847]  Well, Oakland Raiders is a perfect analogy.
[00:35:24.147 --> 00:35:24.327]  Yeah.
[00:35:24.387 --> 00:35:24.668]  Right.
[00:35:24.768 --> 00:35:32.113]  Also, like, outlaw country, they were kicked out of Nashville for admitting they smoked dope, and then, like, five years later, they were 80% of the market.
[00:35:32.514 --> 00:35:33.835]  I mean, that's what's happened.
[00:35:33.995 --> 00:35:34.455]  There you go.
[00:35:34.535 --> 00:35:35.716]  Well, and it's twofold, right?
[00:35:35.736 --> 00:35:41.881]  So we're serving the audience, and the audience needs to get better access to content, and so they don't have, like you said, the tit fatigue where they're paying for this.
[00:35:41.921 --> 00:35:50.048]   It's like your Netflix, Hulu, you know, Amazon, all these different subscriptions that you have, but it's also Creators need contracts that allow them to be who they are.
[00:35:50.268 --> 00:35:57.515]  Like, if I had come down and started talking to you about a contract that makes Alex Jones not Alex Jones, you'd have been like, I don't care how much money you offer, I'm not interested, right?
[00:35:57.996 --> 00:36:05.344]  So this was about how do we structure something that allows content creators to go out there and serve their audience as they see fit.
[00:36:05.704 --> 00:36:05.904]  Right.
[00:36:06.044 --> 00:36:08.287]  That's the big difference in what we're doing and we're not...
[00:36:08.627 --> 00:36:14.770]  We're not trying to start a network where we just buy you and bring you over here and control what you say to make sure we make enough money and profit off of this.
[00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:21.632]  This is, for us, this is about making a change in this country and helping people be equipped to battle daily.
[00:36:22.313 --> 00:36:27.635]  And Gerald, not everybody's the CEO of like the number one independent conservative media company, or even bigger than the liberal companies.
[00:36:27.875 --> 00:36:29.255]  You're freaking me out a little bit.
[00:36:29.275 --> 00:36:29.836]  No, no, talk to me.
[00:36:29.856 --> 00:36:32.117]  The listeners are great, but I need to get this too.
[00:36:33.954 --> 00:36:44.020]  Understand folks, all the other contracts, whether it's with Big Tech or the other conservative outfits, they control you, they say you have to abide by these strictures, so it's rigged.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:49.083]  But what you guys have set up is revolutionary, because it's the only place with a platform that can handle the massive traffic.
[00:36:49.623 --> 00:36:51.264]  And where you can say and do whatever you want.
[00:36:51.344 --> 00:36:52.325]  That's Americana.
[00:36:52.645 --> 00:36:53.626]  That threatens the system.
[00:36:53.686 --> 00:36:54.767]  And it is catching on.
[00:36:55.187 --> 00:36:56.208]  It will catch on.
[00:36:56.548 --> 00:36:57.909]  That's why this is such a big deal.
[00:36:57.929 --> 00:37:00.931]  It's not just we're going to have some funny conservative shows and break some news.
[00:37:01.272 --> 00:37:03.173]  No, folks, this is building the infrastructure.
[00:37:03.493 --> 00:37:04.394]  This is what the enemy fears.
[00:37:04.414 --> 00:37:05.074]  So elaborate on that.
[00:37:05.254 --> 00:37:05.455]  Yeah.
[00:37:05.475 --> 00:37:06.675]  So, I mean, think about it right now.
[00:37:06.715 --> 00:37:08.257]  If you're... And Rumble's a great place.
[00:37:08.297 --> 00:37:10.118]  Before Rumble, we really didn't have a lot of options.
[00:37:10.138 --> 00:37:13.000]  We were trying to get our show out somewhere to make sure if we did get banned.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:13.981]  I mean, you know all about that.
[00:37:14.041 --> 00:37:15.582]  Trying to make sure that it doesn't get banned everywhere.
[00:37:16.182 --> 00:37:19.684]  Right now, with Rumble, the way that it was, there were islands.
[00:37:20.044 --> 00:37:22.185]  And that's great, because you have some really big islands.
[00:37:22.205 --> 00:37:24.986]  You have some big, talented people out there that were trying to do their shows.
[00:37:25.006 --> 00:37:25.507]  But they're isolated.
[00:37:25.527 --> 00:37:26.967]  They make some noise, but they're isolated.
[00:37:27.007 --> 00:37:34.551]  And so, what Rumble saw, based on our conversations with them, after we were like, hey guys, we've got to do something different, was we can allow creators to form networks.
[00:37:35.191 --> 00:37:37.572]  We don't need to be fractured and isolated.
[00:37:37.612 --> 00:37:39.393]  That's exactly what the Dems want.
[00:37:39.413 --> 00:37:40.354]  That's what liberals want.
[00:37:40.374 --> 00:37:41.394]  They don't want you to be effective.
[00:37:41.415 --> 00:37:42.975]  They want you to think you're being effective.
[00:37:43.195 --> 00:37:43.376]  Right.
[00:37:43.416 --> 00:37:43.596]  Right.
[00:37:43.716 --> 00:37:47.738]  And if you've built an audience for yourself and you're out there thinking, OK, I'm just making all the money for myself.
[00:37:48.158 --> 00:37:48.658]  Fantastic.
[00:37:48.698 --> 00:37:49.599]  Maybe that works a little bit.
[00:37:49.619 --> 00:37:50.259]  But guess what?
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:56.423]   If we bind together and jump on the same island, You can't stop that.
[00:37:56.543 --> 00:38:02.025]  We need people to get access to the content that you can produce and that Steven can produce and that Brian and Nick can produce.
[00:38:02.045 --> 00:38:03.286]  Can't we save the country and the world?
[00:38:04.466 --> 00:38:09.068]  Let me put a finer point on it, and that was a great job from Jill, but for example, right now people have a choice.
[00:38:09.328 --> 00:38:17.512]  It's, okay, do I want to do my own thing, closed circuit, where I have my subscribers, I get 100% of the revenue, but I don't benefit from a big network, the exposure, right?
[00:38:17.532 --> 00:38:20.653]  And if you go to one of these networks, you lose your right to your content.
[00:38:20.673 --> 00:38:23.955]  But other than ESP to interrupt, they're going to shut down the banking as they've already tried.
[00:38:24.315 --> 00:38:26.096]  Everybody thinks they're on their own reservation.
[00:38:26.116 --> 00:38:26.676]  No, no, no.
[00:38:26.696 --> 00:38:27.616]  They're going to eat you last.
[00:38:28.376 --> 00:38:33.438]  We literally today had to change some of the credit card processing because we were like, oh wait a second, they hate Alex.
[00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:36.359]  So we made sure that all of that is secure again.
[00:38:36.399 --> 00:38:41.781]  I mean, nothing against, you know, the guy who started Brexit, Nazar Faraj, but that was an international story.
[00:38:41.801 --> 00:38:42.502]  They took his banking.
[00:38:42.762 --> 00:38:43.342]  You take yours.
[00:38:43.362 --> 00:38:45.583]  You're like, yeah, we're just getting, we just got over it.
[00:38:45.922 --> 00:38:48.321]   same thing with me you know but but the problem out there is people have a
[00:38:48.321 --> 00:38:52.101]   choice okay do I make a living by myself on an island or do I give
[00:38:52.101 --> 00:38:55.242]   everything up to go to a network look anyone out there who if you're doing
[00:38:55.242 --> 00:38:57.382]   your own thing you're in an island right you have your own pay service the
[00:38:57.382 --> 00:39:01.782]   patreon look talk with Gerald guarantee you if you compare the numbers you will
[00:39:01.782 --> 00:39:06.342]   make more at mug club and you don't give anything up and you benefit from Alex
[00:39:06.342 --> 00:39:08.946]   myself Nick and more Think about this for a second.
[00:39:08.966 --> 00:39:12.588]  This is one thing, when Gerald and I realized we were on to something, and I hate talking about this because I sound so selfish.
[00:39:12.648 --> 00:39:14.810]  No, but this revolution... No, you are... No, no, no, no.
[00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:17.371]  It's not bragging when you tell people you invented the wheel.
[00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:19.773]  Well, I was about to do it, and now I'm not going to say it.
[00:39:20.073 --> 00:39:21.654]  Now I'm not going to say it, because I feel conceited.
[00:39:21.694 --> 00:39:22.014]  Say it now.
[00:39:22.274 --> 00:39:29.659]  So, when we were dealing with sponsors back in the day, right, we were on YouTube, and all of a sudden sponsors were wanting to pay just for Mug Club, because they go, wait, wait a second.
[00:39:29.959 --> 00:39:30.779]  How many people are tuning in?
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.020]  How many tens of thousands?
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:40.867]   How many people are tuning in Basically who are poor subscribers and that space became valuable advertising space because so many that's unheard of.
[00:39:41.487 --> 00:39:49.510]  Hitting the tip jar because you want to see someone do well is very different from creating content that people want to tune into every day and that's why we want to provide value added.
[00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:55.932]  This is all about giving the people power who already want freedom and justice and populism and conservatism and Christianity.
[00:39:56.472 --> 00:39:58.873]  So all we're doing is saying here's what you want make it big.
[00:39:59.093 --> 00:39:59.673]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:59.693 --> 00:40:01.054]  And you mentioned this on the show.
[00:40:01.454 --> 00:40:03.554]  Instead of just doing the boycott, we need to do a boycott.
[00:40:03.574 --> 00:40:05.635]  That works really, really well with Chick-fil-A.
[00:40:05.655 --> 00:40:10.396]  Now, I know they've since made some steps that we don't agree with, but at the time, they were packed.
[00:40:10.736 --> 00:40:13.537]  The very next day after that, they were packed with people.
[00:40:13.897 --> 00:40:14.457]  I went there.
[00:40:14.637 --> 00:40:19.359]  They doubled their market share off that, and they're just saying, we were off on Sunday and we're not commies.
[00:40:19.399 --> 00:40:20.739]  We're saying we're battling the commies.
[00:40:20.819 --> 00:40:28.228]  Yeah, well they were fighting, I think there was a gay guy in the drive-thru or something like that that was giving them crap and the video went out and then we went and supported them.
[00:40:28.328 --> 00:40:35.776]  Imagine if conservatives did that on a daily basis with content that they love, with businesses that they love, that hold their values.
[00:40:36.077 --> 00:40:37.418]  There are those companies out there.
[00:40:37.438 --> 00:40:38.600]  It just takes a minute to find them.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.260]  And as soon as you do, it's like, fine.
[00:40:40.361 --> 00:40:41.241]  I think Yingling, right?
[00:40:41.281 --> 00:40:44.882]  That was one that really capitalized off of the fact that Bud Light... Yeah, they stepped right in on Bud Light.
[00:40:44.902 --> 00:40:45.122]  They did!
[00:40:45.142 --> 00:40:45.662]  But you know what, though?
[00:40:45.682 --> 00:40:46.202]  Here's the thing, too.
[00:40:46.242 --> 00:40:47.903]  Here's a perfect example of Yingling, okay?
[00:40:48.003 --> 00:40:48.823]  And I'm not going to name names.
[00:40:49.203 --> 00:40:49.984]  Yingling has been around.
[00:40:50.324 --> 00:40:52.304]  They've always just been a brewery, one of the oldest breweries.
[00:40:52.404 --> 00:40:53.545]  They happen to be conservative.
[00:40:53.885 --> 00:40:57.666]  But when the Bud Light thing happened, how many people came out going, we're America's beer!
[00:40:57.686 --> 00:40:58.946]  And they're selling a six-pack for $40.
[00:40:59.587 --> 00:41:01.387]  That's using you to make money.
[00:41:01.427 --> 00:41:02.888]  That's not creating a product that you want.
[00:41:02.988 --> 00:41:05.209]  Yingling is a product that people want, and those people are patriots.
[00:41:05.609 --> 00:41:06.589]  That's the difference.
[00:41:06.749 --> 00:41:07.329]  Well, it's simple.
[00:41:07.409 --> 00:41:09.810]  If people support this, we'll change the world and beat them.
[00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:11.110]  They're scared of my broadcast.
[00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:11.750]  They're scared of yours.
[00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:12.730]  We're not whiners.
[00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.790]  Oh, they took our banks.
[00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:15.371]  We probably should be bigger whiners.
[00:41:15.471 --> 00:41:16.351]  Hey, we're under attack.
[00:41:16.971 --> 00:41:19.292]  But they're literally scared of this.
[00:41:19.352 --> 00:41:23.532]  But getting to Nick, I know you don't want to give away your great comedy just here on the main broadcast.
[00:41:23.552 --> 00:41:26.513]  That's what your show that you do every day, you know, coming up this afternoon.
[00:41:26.533 --> 00:41:26.873]  Tell us about it.
[00:41:26.893 --> 00:41:31.274]  But some of the politically incorrect stuff, give it to us right now for my audience.
[00:41:32.274 --> 00:41:33.314]  Yeah, so don't be put on the spot.
[00:41:33.334 --> 00:41:34.855]  Or what are some of the jokes you got in trouble for?
[00:41:36.954 --> 00:41:38.616]  Obama, when Obama was in office.
[00:41:38.636 --> 00:41:40.738]  Remember when they threw shoes at George Bush?
[00:41:40.799 --> 00:41:41.219]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:41:41.379 --> 00:41:43.522]  He dodged it pretty quick.
[00:41:43.742 --> 00:41:45.043]  When Obama was president.
[00:41:45.124 --> 00:41:49.709]  I would do these jokes, by the way, at the Comedy Cellar in New York, which is on the fucking campus.
[00:41:50.009 --> 00:41:53.673]  Which is on the campus of... The campus of NYU.
[00:41:53.753 --> 00:41:54.895]  It's on the fucking campus.
[00:41:54.975 --> 00:41:55.896]  It's on the campus of NYU.
[00:41:57.466 --> 00:41:59.127]  And it's all liberals in the audience.
[00:41:59.147 --> 00:42:00.909]  I came out right after the Bush incident.
[00:42:00.969 --> 00:42:07.734]  I said, you know, I don't agree with anything Obama has to say, but I would never throw a shoe at his head unless it needed shining.
[00:42:10.489 --> 00:42:13.992]  And again, just, come on, I know Obama's a deep beast.
[00:42:14.012 --> 00:42:16.795]  You were telling me last night at the dinner how you open your show now.
[00:42:16.815 --> 00:42:27.165]  I open my show, I come out, the last couple of months I go, uh, how many people here hope Nancy Pelosi has been using Roundup in her garden for 10 years?
[00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:27.846]  I do!
[00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:31.151]  There's no fat on that joke!
[00:42:31.391 --> 00:42:34.992]  It's just a funny way of saying, I hope she gets cancer, which he doesn't actually, maybe he does.
[00:42:35.272 --> 00:42:37.833]  But it's, think about it, there's a huge difference.
[00:42:37.853 --> 00:42:38.894]  Nancy Pelosi is cancer.
[00:42:39.154 --> 00:42:39.434]  Yes.
[00:42:39.734 --> 00:42:40.094]  Yes.
[00:42:40.875 --> 00:42:42.775]  Yeah, she's at least mutagenic.
[00:42:42.995 --> 00:42:43.776]  She has some capacity.
[00:42:44.136 --> 00:42:45.136]  What is wrong with you?
[00:42:46.517 --> 00:42:47.237]  Did I just hear those words?
[00:42:47.497 --> 00:42:49.098]  Did you say Nancy Pelosi is cancer?
[00:42:49.118 --> 00:42:50.698]  My number one dream is the Crypt Keeper.
[00:42:51.078 --> 00:42:51.519]  Oh, okay.
[00:42:52.876 --> 00:42:54.097]  Everyone else wanted Elvira.
[00:42:54.117 --> 00:42:56.480]  He's looking at that snide Crypt Keeper.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.921]  He doesn't even turn to look at the Crypt Keeper now.
[00:42:58.022 --> 00:43:02.582]   with all of his stupid little uh his little like what was his little puns like they're dying to get
[00:43:02.582 --> 00:43:20.104]   in you know more jokes he looks like jesse ventura I talk about, uh, I have all these white friends, comedians, who, you know, well, the ones that are not close to me and they don't like me, but they say, I've never used the n-word in my life, and I say, well, I guess you should never bet ten grand on an NBA playoff game.
[00:43:22.624 --> 00:43:27.485]  I go, LeBron James misses a three-pointer with two seconds left, what are you yelling at the TV?
[00:43:27.665 --> 00:43:29.286]  Oh, that person of color.
[00:43:32.623 --> 00:43:35.905]  And look, this is one of those things where... But that's good, it disarms the whole thing.
[00:43:35.945 --> 00:43:36.146]  Yeah!
[00:43:36.186 --> 00:43:36.866]  That's right!
[00:43:37.086 --> 00:43:37.366]  Oh my god.
[00:43:37.386 --> 00:43:38.047]  That's exactly right.
[00:43:38.067 --> 00:43:39.908]  And you become inoculated at a certain point.
[00:43:39.928 --> 00:43:41.609]  You know, the hit pieces just that are non-stop.
[00:43:41.629 --> 00:43:44.591]  Like, can you imagine if people knew what happened in green rooms back in the day?
[00:43:44.611 --> 00:43:44.751]  Right.
[00:43:44.992 --> 00:43:45.292]  Oh man.
[00:43:45.352 --> 00:43:47.754]  And I've been called... This is another one that disarms them.
[00:43:48.134 --> 00:43:49.775]  I was called the N-word, and this is true.
[00:43:49.875 --> 00:43:51.256]  In middle school... Well, you're Sicilian.
[00:43:51.656 --> 00:43:51.856]  Yeah.
[00:43:52.457 --> 00:43:53.377]  I'm not Sicilian.
[00:43:55.391 --> 00:44:04.083]  It's so dark in the summertime as a kid that all these little white pricks, Irish, would call me Nick the N-word, you know?
[00:44:04.563 --> 00:44:08.188]  And then I'd say, well, it didn't help my mother sent me to school in a purple suit and a fur coat.
[00:44:10.251 --> 00:44:11.251]  Malcolm X Lunchbox.
[00:44:11.271 --> 00:44:12.593]  God, I wish I had that tan skin.
[00:44:12.633 --> 00:44:12.953]  I love it.
[00:44:13.293 --> 00:44:15.936]  I don't think it was your tan skin so much as you posted a dog fighting ring.
[00:44:15.956 --> 00:44:17.757]  What's the type of stuff?
[00:44:17.777 --> 00:44:18.698]  I mean, even black.
[00:44:19.099 --> 00:44:22.182]  It's always the white people that have complained my whole career.
[00:44:22.242 --> 00:44:23.863]  You know, it's always them.
[00:44:24.003 --> 00:44:25.825]  A lot of white liberals use it for control.
[00:44:26.145 --> 00:44:26.706]  Exactly.
[00:44:26.806 --> 00:44:28.167]  And they're the ones, the first ones.
[00:44:28.708 --> 00:44:31.330]  Now, when I do live comedy, my people come out to see me.
[00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:33.452]  They know it's coming, so I don't have that many walkouts.
[00:44:33.672 --> 00:44:33.792]  Right.
[00:44:33.812 --> 00:44:40.076]  But there's always a couple, you know, people that walk in that didn't do their homework and research who's at the comedy club.
[00:44:40.496 --> 00:44:45.199]  And it's usually four or five white people that, you know, they can't put two minutes into it.
[00:44:45.219 --> 00:44:47.520]  I'll steal one of Nick's... I mean, with fat jokes and they get upset.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.521]  I'll steal one of Nick's own jokes.
[00:44:49.581 --> 00:44:51.502]  He performed at the casino.
[00:44:51.542 --> 00:44:52.563]  He walked the reservation.
[00:44:52.583 --> 00:44:53.403]  I guess I did.
[00:44:53.683 --> 00:44:55.344]  Give me some fat jokes and some fag jokes.
[00:44:55.404 --> 00:44:56.145]  Oh, no, come on now.
[00:44:56.225 --> 00:44:58.026]  Look, this is just getting out of control.
[00:44:58.326 --> 00:44:58.786]  But this is my show.
[00:45:01.708 --> 00:45:13.893]  Nick DiPaolo is one of those guys, look, people who don't know, uh, we always say, like, there was a guy, for example, in Jiu-Jitsu, everyone knew, and Hicks and Gracie was his name, right, I'm using a sport that I know, but everyone knew, oh, this guy, Riccardo Laborio, he's the guy, behind the scenes, he's the guy everyone went to.
[00:45:14.553 --> 00:45:24.437]  Nick is the guy behind the scenes, when people need a doctor for their joke, they go to him, still to this day, right, they want him to help them behind the scenes, but they want to put baby in the corner when it's not really convenient.
[00:45:24.477 --> 00:45:25.937]  Nick has never been convenient.
[00:45:26.017 --> 00:45:28.299]   Look, nothing about what we do, Is easy.
[00:45:28.319 --> 00:45:29.440]  You think you're easy?
[00:45:29.681 --> 00:45:30.421]  I love you dearly.
[00:45:30.521 --> 00:45:32.944]  You're not easy to work with because you're passionate.
[00:45:32.964 --> 00:45:33.665]  You have your ideas.
[00:45:33.685 --> 00:45:34.726]  You're like a ping pong ball.
[00:45:34.766 --> 00:45:37.449]  Bing, bing, bing, all around the room because you care.
[00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:38.791]  And Nick, you're not going to tell.
[00:45:39.251 --> 00:45:40.953]  Nick, when have we ever told you on your show?
[00:45:40.973 --> 00:45:42.054]  Have we ever made a call?
[00:45:42.094 --> 00:45:42.835]  Like you should say this.
[00:45:42.855 --> 00:45:43.416]  You shouldn't say that.
[00:45:43.836 --> 00:45:44.137]  Ever once.
[00:45:44.717 --> 00:45:45.398]  Oh, God, no.
[00:45:45.478 --> 00:45:45.638]  No.
[00:45:45.718 --> 00:45:45.918]  No.
[00:45:45.958 --> 00:45:46.339]  You know why?
[00:45:46.359 --> 00:45:48.761]  Because he would hang up on me and quit immediately.
[00:45:48.781 --> 00:45:50.242]  Well, I want to hear some of these bad jokes.
[00:45:50.723 --> 00:46:01.693]  No, but I was just saying, somebody sent me an article a few years ago on Reddit, and Chris Rock was talking about, he goes, there's this one white comic out there who is funny as...
[00:46:02.711 --> 00:46:03.051]  Whatever.
[00:46:03.431 --> 00:46:08.693]  And, uh, just, we all, you know, he, he races as hell, but we absolutely love him.
[00:46:08.973 --> 00:46:12.154]  And I'm reading this and so I, I text Chris Frock, right?
[00:46:12.214 --> 00:46:13.975]  I go, are you, were you talking about me?
[00:46:14.355 --> 00:46:15.996]  He's like, you're damn right, Gepardo!
[00:46:16.356 --> 00:46:17.336]  And he goes, it gets better.
[00:46:17.376 --> 00:46:23.438]  We were at Eddie Murphy's house, Jamie Foxx was there, and, uh, Arsenio Hall, and they all loved my comedy.
[00:46:23.758 --> 00:46:24.339]  Yeah.
[00:46:24.459 --> 00:46:27.280]  And I'm not, you know, I go, hey, Chris, you're racist.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.621]  If I'm, if you call me a racist, that makes him a racist.
[00:46:31.101 --> 00:46:32.242]  I love black people making white jokes.
[00:46:32.282 --> 00:46:34.003]  It's all funny, man.
[00:46:34.263 --> 00:46:36.685]  Oh yeah, it's all funny, and it used to be okay.
[00:46:36.705 --> 00:46:45.152]  I mean, we've started doing this segment, Black and White and the Gray Issues, where I just go down to an area, a black area of town, and say, hey man, can we just talk, like, whatever it is, voter ID, or talk about the trans issues, because you know what?
[00:46:45.212 --> 00:46:48.434]  I will say this about black Americans, and everyone's going to say, look, a bunch of white guys talking about it.
[00:46:51.036 --> 00:46:57.262]  By the way, I worked for Chris Rock for two years at HBO when he had a hit show.
[00:46:57.702 --> 00:46:59.604]  I texted Tony Rock and he just said, who this?
[00:47:00.004 --> 00:47:01.185]  So I don't have the same showbiz.
[00:47:01.986 --> 00:47:10.733]  But no, we go down and we talk with people and I don't think that there's a group of people who are more overly represented in the media without being represented at all.
[00:47:10.934 --> 00:47:17.039]  You want to tell me that Joy Reid, that any of these people, or Al Sharpton, or Van Jones, they have nothing in common.
[00:47:17.199 --> 00:47:18.059]  With the average black American.
[00:47:18.079 --> 00:47:19.019]  No, they probably vote Democrat.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.260]  They're minions of white communist academics.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:21.580]  Yeah.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:25.141]  And they use them as a puppet, like, I'll take America's socks over here.
[00:47:25.381 --> 00:47:25.581]  Yeah.
[00:47:26.762 --> 00:47:28.242]  It's a good puppet voice.
[00:47:28.262 --> 00:47:30.663]  Meanwhile, it's Rachel Maddow with her armor possessed.
[00:47:30.683 --> 00:47:32.103]  Senior Jones-esque.
[00:47:32.183 --> 00:47:34.664]  I've never chopped little boys' pee-pees off.
[00:47:34.684 --> 00:47:35.664]  That's a weird puppet.
[00:47:35.684 --> 00:47:36.804]  That's terrible puppet.
[00:47:36.824 --> 00:47:37.384]  That's horrible.
[00:47:37.424 --> 00:47:38.145]  How'd you get a knife?
[00:47:38.165 --> 00:47:39.205]  That's Permit the Cop!
[00:47:39.864 --> 00:47:41.084]  That smuggled the children!
[00:47:41.464 --> 00:47:42.605]  What's wrong with pedophilia?
[00:47:42.865 --> 00:47:45.306]  That's Kermit the Frog with throat polyps.
[00:47:45.606 --> 00:47:48.827]  His next puppet's gonna come out with a voice box.
[00:47:49.007 --> 00:47:50.587]  Hello, I want to drive the children.
[00:47:50.627 --> 00:47:52.528]  Gerald, what else is on your amazing radar?
[00:47:52.548 --> 00:47:54.008]  Hey, can I say one thing about Gerald?
[00:47:54.028 --> 00:47:55.329]  Can I say one thing about Gerald, Alex?
[00:47:55.509 --> 00:47:56.429]  He's unbelievably smart.
[00:47:56.449 --> 00:47:57.269]  That he's mine now?
[00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:58.350]  Gerald is my litmus test.
[00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:59.630]  Gerald is my litmus test.
[00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:04.371]  He's such a, he's, I don't want to say Boy Scout because he's firm, but he's such a nice guy.
[00:48:04.531 --> 00:48:09.493]  He's such a good man that if someone says, hey, Gerald is a piece of, I go, oh, that person is a liar.
[00:48:10.034 --> 00:48:13.504]  Because you're not going to find a guy nicer and more steadfast than Jerry.
[00:48:13.524 --> 00:48:14.025]  Well, I'm a liar.
[00:48:16.238 --> 00:48:17.419]  Well, Steven, haven't you heard?
[00:48:17.439 --> 00:48:18.179]  I'm very threatening.
[00:48:18.639 --> 00:48:20.040]  Yes, oh yes, you're very threatening.
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:20.760]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.861]  Running an office is a threatening thing to do.
[00:48:22.881 --> 00:48:25.282]  No, look, we're looking to expand.
[00:48:25.582 --> 00:48:29.324]  We've talked about documentaries and some series that we want to do as well in Mug Club.
[00:48:29.704 --> 00:48:32.465]  Just as this grows, really, the sky's the limit, right?
[00:48:32.485 --> 00:48:39.428]  So these guys, the comedians in the room, man, gosh, keeping up with them is very difficult, but they were supposed to be the last line of defense for free speech, right?
[00:48:39.468 --> 00:48:41.028]  The Canary in the Coal Mine, you were part of that.
[00:48:41.409 --> 00:48:49.492]   When they started coming after comedians and saying, your comedy's not okay, That's when we started, like, there's no safe place left for free speech, right?
[00:48:49.552 --> 00:48:53.555]  So having comedians kind of be at the forefront of this makes perfect sense.
[00:48:53.595 --> 00:48:59.638]  Having those specials coming out so more comedians can come and get the best of both worlds of exposure and finances on their specials.
[00:49:00.038 --> 00:49:00.698]  That's fantastic.
[00:49:00.718 --> 00:49:01.699]  But there are so many other things.
[00:49:01.739 --> 00:49:03.440]  The animated series that Steven talked about.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.561]  I think he had like a 10-part series already written.
[00:49:06.581 --> 00:49:07.522]  We need to find the right animator.
[00:49:08.302 --> 00:49:09.483]  Yeah.
[00:49:09.543 --> 00:49:10.763]  That's the fun thing about Mug Club.
[00:49:10.903 --> 00:49:12.544]  If you have an idea, great!
[00:49:12.764 --> 00:49:13.284]  Let's do it.
[00:49:13.344 --> 00:49:15.025]  Nick and I are talking about doing a sports show.
[00:49:15.645 --> 00:49:19.767]  It may only have one episode, but we're going to try to put it up.
[00:49:19.807 --> 00:49:20.528]  You've got our Bible.
[00:49:20.908 --> 00:49:22.209]  Yeah, the apologetics thing.
[00:49:22.229 --> 00:49:25.430]  I think one goes up this week, and the next one goes up next week.
[00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:26.231]  But you know what?
[00:49:26.311 --> 00:49:27.311]  This is really important to note.
[00:49:27.511 --> 00:49:33.614]   So when you talk about sports, you have a lot of these conservative programs out there that will say, Oh, we're doing a comedy show, but none of them have ever done comedy.
[00:49:33.634 --> 00:49:34.354]  We're going to do a sports show.
[00:49:34.634 --> 00:49:36.095]  Nick had a sports show, right?
[00:49:36.135 --> 00:49:38.055]  One of the incredibly popular sports show.
[00:49:38.355 --> 00:49:40.616]  Brian Callen has a sports show that relates to fighting.
[00:49:40.696 --> 00:49:42.457]  And Gerald was on full scholarship at Notre Dame.
[00:49:42.737 --> 00:49:46.578]  These aren't billionaires saying, hey, let's have these guys talk sports and make some money off the sports audience.
[00:49:46.898 --> 00:49:50.940]  These people have been doing it their whole life, and it was taken from them because of their points of view.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:51.600]  That's what we want.
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:53.640]  The left will hold it against you for being a jock.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:53.900]  Yeah.
[00:49:54.001 --> 00:49:54.601]  It's so funny.
[00:49:54.621 --> 00:49:55.221]  It's all about power.
[00:49:55.481 --> 00:50:00.868]  Yeah, well they were the nerds and that, you know, like somebody said, the nerds have the key to the gym right now.
[00:50:01.028 --> 00:50:01.208]  Yeah.
[00:50:01.409 --> 00:50:02.390]  And they friggin...
[00:50:03.753 --> 00:50:06.734]  I was about to say, I'm built like a gorilla and I'm the little guy around here.
[00:50:06.794 --> 00:50:09.595]  You're built like the barrel people use to go over the waterfalls.
[00:50:09.615 --> 00:50:11.955]  The guy there looks like Kevin.
[00:50:12.215 --> 00:50:13.096]  Oh yeah, my friend Kevin.
[00:50:13.436 --> 00:50:15.436]  Yeah, that's the man who just, he's just born that way.
[00:50:15.536 --> 00:50:16.056]  He's 6'8", 340.
[00:50:16.236 --> 00:50:17.637]  Yeah, and ripped.
[00:50:17.697 --> 00:50:19.977]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you just can't teach it.
[00:50:20.338 --> 00:50:21.378]  Like Hulk Hogan.
[00:50:21.458 --> 00:50:23.618]  But you know what though, too, same thing that happened with the conservative movement.
[00:50:24.119 --> 00:50:30.780]  Nick, doesn't it bother you more, like you expect the media to come after you, right, and do the hit pieces, but when comics would say, oh, you know, you really shouldn't say that, or that's too far.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.321]  That for me is when I get so scared.
[00:50:33.201 --> 00:50:35.262]  Yeah, it's the comics going after other comics.
[00:50:35.643 --> 00:50:49.632]  Well, when I put my last special out on the album cover, it was me giving the finger to a woke audience, and I grabbed a picture of a Native American woman, a lesbian, whatever.
[00:50:49.912 --> 00:50:51.273]  And a black guy.
[00:50:51.613 --> 00:50:55.115]  And the black guy happened to be, um, it was a stock photo.
[00:50:55.415 --> 00:50:56.095]  I just grabbed it.
[00:50:56.115 --> 00:50:59.197]  He happened to be one of the first guys to head up BLM.
[00:50:59.657 --> 00:51:01.458]  Ended up getting shot in New Orleans.
[00:51:01.558 --> 00:51:01.838]  Oh no.
[00:51:01.978 --> 00:51:08.261]  And they thought I chose some female comic who's not even on the goddamn radar in New York, like an open mic-er.
[00:51:08.501 --> 00:51:11.703]  Some Asian girl complained that I chose him intentionally.
[00:51:11.723 --> 00:51:13.804]  And it started a whole big brouhaha.
[00:51:15.344 --> 00:51:16.745]  Yeah, it's the most absurd thing in the world.
[00:51:16.765 --> 00:51:18.546]  But look, it's all about we've done something wrong.
[00:51:18.606 --> 00:51:20.667]  No, we've not been arrested, we're not committing crimes, leave us alone.
[00:51:21.007 --> 00:51:21.927]  You guys gotta go.
[00:51:22.207 --> 00:51:24.008]  Some stations don't care that it's the next five.
[00:51:24.388 --> 00:51:28.350]  And then we've got Pastor Rodney Howard-Brown who's going to South Africa with all the mass murder going on there.
[00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:29.130]  He's going to join us.
[00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:32.891]  But do five more minutes with me because I want to talk about how people find this.
[00:51:32.911 --> 00:51:36.853]  People can find Nick DiPaolo at nickdip.com, nickdip.com.
[00:51:37.613 --> 00:51:38.794]  BrianKellen.com.
[00:51:38.814 --> 00:51:39.214]  He couldn't be here.
[00:51:39.234 --> 00:51:39.694]  Had to fly out.
[00:51:39.714 --> 00:51:40.395]  Amazing guy.
[00:51:40.875 --> 00:51:41.535]  The Mug Club.
[00:51:42.056 --> 00:51:47.098]  The best place to go is simply JonesCrowder.com and you get a month free at JonesCrowder.com.
[00:51:47.498 --> 00:51:48.399]  This is all being added.
[00:51:48.419 --> 00:51:49.259]  This is all going down.
[00:51:49.299 --> 00:51:50.000]  This is huge.
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:51.620]  JonesCrowder.com.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.341]  You want us to fight?
[00:51:52.381 --> 00:51:53.101]  You want us to build it?
[00:51:53.441 --> 00:51:54.602]  You want us to do it?
[00:51:54.902 --> 00:51:58.044]  Then don't just take $40 billion away from Anheuser-Busch, though I love that.
[00:51:58.424 --> 00:52:01.105]  How about you just support us and we will make you proud.
[00:52:01.365 --> 00:52:02.286]  It's not like we're lightweights.
[00:52:02.526 --> 00:52:05.889]  We're at the tip of the spear, and this is a big deal for Steven Crowder.
[00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:10.114]  He's got big balls, because all the rest of the conservatives, I don't even think, have penises.
[00:52:10.474 --> 00:52:12.676]  So we're going to need at least the leadership of him.
[00:52:13.137 --> 00:52:14.098]  He'll be right back.
[00:52:14.358 --> 00:52:14.818]  Stay with us.
[00:52:14.858 --> 00:52:15.959]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.323]  Alright, this is a big announcement, a very exciting day.
[00:52:19.343 --> 00:52:24.128]  I don't even have words to hype it here with Steven Crowder and the rest of his amazing crew.
[00:52:24.188 --> 00:52:25.229]  We obviously have Gerald.
[00:52:25.849 --> 00:52:29.232]  Morgan here, Brian Kellen couldn't be here, but he's briankellen.com.
[00:52:29.592 --> 00:52:31.594]  Nick Napalos here, the Hodge twins as well.
[00:52:31.674 --> 00:52:32.715]  Again, Brian just flew out.
[00:52:33.115 --> 00:52:35.277]  Each of you guys, thanks for staying over this last five minutes.
[00:52:35.678 --> 00:52:36.798]  Closing comment from Nick.
[00:52:37.519 --> 00:52:38.480]  I'm just excited.
[00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:41.903]  I'm in the presence of greatness, and I had nowhere to go.
[00:52:43.684 --> 00:52:46.226]  Luckily, my career, you know, I was flying under the radar.
[00:52:46.246 --> 00:52:48.208]  It's like they cornered you and you went somewhere good.
[00:52:48.368 --> 00:52:48.849]  That's right.
[00:52:48.989 --> 00:52:53.232]  I got cornered, and Stephen had, you know, he came along at the right time, like I said.
[00:52:54.053 --> 00:52:54.774]  I was terrified.
[00:52:54.814 --> 00:52:57.856]  I was terrified to call Nick, because again, he was my comedy idol.
[00:52:57.916 --> 00:52:59.037]  Which is hilarious to me.
[00:52:59.057 --> 00:53:00.298]  Well, because I thought he'd be like, who the hell are you?
[00:53:00.318 --> 00:53:01.800]  I've been doing this for... and he's a veteran.
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:04.922]  I was like, hey, we have this platform, and I really think you'd... and he was like, oh, yeah.
[00:53:05.403 --> 00:53:06.784]  And it was just one... same thing with you.
[00:53:06.864 --> 00:53:07.244]  Gerald knows.
[00:53:07.264 --> 00:53:09.126]  I was like, well, Alex doesn't need anybody.
[00:53:09.486 --> 00:53:10.167]  We're all here.
[00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:15.611]  It's like they say, like the best relationship, you know, even if it's a marriage, is people are together and either one can leave it.
[00:53:15.631 --> 00:53:18.254]  Well, like in New York, we're about to fight, two gangs join up.
[00:53:19.014 --> 00:53:19.414]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:19.435 --> 00:53:23.958]  It's at the Dead Rabbits and whatever, where Daniel Day-Lewis does the exact same thing as There Will Be Blood, but they give him an Oscar.
[00:53:23.978 --> 00:53:24.919]  It's a different place, yeah.
[00:53:25.239 --> 00:53:26.120]  I'm the butcher!
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.841]  I'm the oil man!
[00:53:28.102 --> 00:53:28.602]  Oh, wow, what a range!
[00:53:28.622 --> 00:53:30.324]  Cut this awful piece of that beef off!
[00:53:30.344 --> 00:53:35.728]  Yeah, but Nick is just a guy who I've loved for a long time, and just, you know, even being, it means that we all want to be here.
[00:53:35.968 --> 00:53:39.271]  And like you've talked about, when people talk about growing, look, I hope that people see the fruits of their labor.
[00:53:39.291 --> 00:53:43.394]  Like, we started Mug Club was something that was really just our show, and doing the Friday Show and expanding.
[00:53:43.614 --> 00:53:45.614]   We could just take it and go but we will have as many people...
[00:53:45.614 --> 00:53:47.614]   And it blows and YouTube sell out. They try to shut it down and you survive.
[00:53:47.614 --> 00:53:49.614]   I mean how many times have we been suspended in the last six months?
[00:53:49.614 --> 00:53:51.614]  Great, fine, we'll do it.
[00:53:51.614 --> 00:53:54.614]   We want to be on YouTube. We want to be on all those platforms
[00:53:54.614 --> 00:53:57.614]  so long as we are not there at the cost of the truth.
[00:53:57.614 --> 00:54:00.614]   And so we'll take the suspensions. We've already been demonetized for years.
[00:54:00.614 --> 00:54:02.614]  I don't give a rat's ass anymore.
[00:54:02.614 --> 00:54:05.614]  We are funded entirely by viewers like you.
[00:54:05.614 --> 00:54:07.614]  By viewers like Alex's.
[00:54:07.614 --> 00:54:11.614]   And if just a tenth of you out there say, "Alright, I'm gonna give it a shot." Guess what? There's no
[00:54:11.614 --> 00:54:11.614]  chance.
[00:54:11.614 --> 00:54:17.373]   notice what your promo cover folks who want to sign up nick dip calm
[00:54:15.562 --> 00:54:17.283]  You were about to say something before he cut you off.
[00:54:17.644 --> 00:54:20.266]  No, I was going to say you sounded like a PBS guy.
[00:54:20.306 --> 00:54:24.449]  Yeah, your contributions will take a tote bag with a telethon.
[00:54:24.489 --> 00:54:27.251]  The commies get billions and they beg for money on top of it.
[00:54:27.271 --> 00:54:27.811]  That's right.
[00:54:27.891 --> 00:54:29.132]  Here's a $100 thing and it was nothing.
[00:54:29.192 --> 00:54:30.033]  Here's a CD for $5,000.
[00:54:30.113 --> 00:54:31.034]  I don't think I've seen that.
[00:54:31.274 --> 00:54:32.015]  Here's a book bag for $300.
[00:54:32.055 --> 00:54:33.416]  A Julia Child cookbook for $450.
[00:54:33.256 --> 00:54:35.256]  I don't think I've seen that.
[00:54:35.256 --> 00:54:37.256]  Julia Child cookbook for 450 bucks.
[00:54:37.256 --> 00:54:43.256]  Here's a preparation age container for 300 dollars.
[00:54:43.256 --> 00:54:45.256]  A tote bag to put your wife's head in.
[00:54:45.547 --> 00:54:46.287]  Yes, exactly.
[00:54:46.327 --> 00:54:46.867]  Exactly.
[00:54:46.928 --> 00:54:47.468]  Julia Child.
[00:54:47.488 --> 00:54:51.590]  Wow, we're reaching, but we got Danny Kaye, we got Julia Child, we got his pedophile puppet.
[00:54:53.311 --> 00:54:55.432]  Alex Jones is doing Julia Child.
[00:54:55.552 --> 00:54:55.972]  I know.
[00:54:56.052 --> 00:54:57.753]  I love this bread.
[00:54:58.313 --> 00:54:59.353]  Stuff it in there.
[00:54:59.493 --> 00:55:00.614]  Delicious.
[00:55:00.634 --> 00:55:02.695]  That would be the hardest voice for Alex to do.
[00:55:02.735 --> 00:55:04.836]  That's hilarious.
[00:55:04.856 --> 00:55:05.756]  The hardest voice for him to do.
[00:55:05.836 --> 00:55:06.637]  I love butter.
[00:55:08.298 --> 00:55:09.438]  I'll get you next time.
[00:55:09.498 --> 00:55:11.059]  I would love an Alex Jones cooking show.
[00:55:11.079 --> 00:55:12.980]  Like, alright, I'm gonna stuff this hand with vodka.
[00:55:14.508 --> 00:55:14.848]  Hold on!
[00:55:15.089 --> 00:55:17.170]  This is not really alcohol!
[00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:19.052]  This is not really alcohol!
[00:55:19.272 --> 00:55:19.772]  Oh lord.
[00:55:20.373 --> 00:55:23.755]  Oh lord.
[00:55:23.996 --> 00:55:25.457]  It's peach schnapple.
[00:55:26.958 --> 00:55:29.280]  Folks, I don't really drink pure whiskey.
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:30.321]  This is fake.
[00:55:31.081 --> 00:55:33.844]  The key to good brisket is whiskey.
[00:55:33.924 --> 00:55:34.664]  It's ever clear.
[00:55:35.045 --> 00:55:39.328]  Now look, look, I'm going to tell you that it doesn't work, but that's just because I want to control you with mind control and chemical agents.
[00:55:39.348 --> 00:55:40.249]  Bottom line, folks.
[00:55:41.058 --> 00:55:41.418]  Everclear.
[00:55:41.638 --> 00:55:42.799]  Jonescrowder.com.

[00:55:47.002 --> 00:55:48.063]  I mean, who's fighting for you?
[00:55:48.383 --> 00:55:50.104]  Gerald Captain Morgan.
[00:55:50.164 --> 00:55:50.785]  Closing comments.
[00:55:50.825 --> 00:55:51.525]  Oh, that's a good nickname.
[00:55:51.545 --> 00:55:52.386]  I can't believe I didn't think that.
[00:55:52.486 --> 00:55:53.907]  Look, this is just the beginning, guys.
[00:55:53.967 --> 00:55:55.748]  You have seen us take some major steps.
[00:55:55.788 --> 00:56:00.211]  We've got the white whale, like we said, the number one draft pick, free agent guy out there.
[00:56:00.251 --> 00:56:01.632]  We brought him onto the platform.
[00:56:01.652 --> 00:56:03.033]  The network is growing right now.
[00:56:03.073 --> 00:56:04.474]  He's just been doing more shows.
[00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:05.215]  I'm going to keep talking.
[00:56:05.555 --> 00:56:07.716]  You're going to be doing more shows, more content.
[00:56:07.796 --> 00:56:15.258]  Listen, if you want to win, this is not a pump and dump marketing scheme where we want you to buy something so you feel like you're helping and you feel like you're winning.
[00:56:15.298 --> 00:56:15.478]  No.
[00:56:15.878 --> 00:56:17.479]  You're going to buy products that are good.
[00:56:17.579 --> 00:56:19.700]  If he has sponsors, they're good sponsors.
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:20.760]  If we have sponsors, same thing.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:21.460]  Good sponsors.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:22.420]  But you're voting?

[00:56:32.064 --> 00:56:33.364]  We're long haul, folks.
[00:56:33.544 --> 00:56:33.664]  Yeah.
[00:56:33.724 --> 00:56:35.807]  If there's anybody long-hauled heading back down, it's us.
[00:56:35.927 --> 00:56:36.468]  Absolutely.
[00:56:36.528 --> 00:56:37.109]  I love you, brother.
[00:56:37.129 --> 00:56:40.914]  You're the white whale, and I will leave you with Nick Nolte as Captain Ahab if he doesn't work.
[00:56:41.115 --> 00:56:43.378]  We're lost, you son of a bitch!
[00:56:43.538 --> 00:56:44.579]  We're lost!
[00:56:45.282 --> 00:56:45.762]  Amazing.
[00:56:45.782 --> 00:56:46.883]  Alright, I love you guys.

[00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.630]  I love you to death.
[00:56:56.970 --> 00:56:59.331]  I want this to explode because I want to impress these guys.
[00:56:59.351 --> 00:57:00.032]  They've already exploded.
[00:57:00.072 --> 00:57:02.013]  I'm like, kind of like, I'm just blessed to be here.
[00:57:02.053 --> 00:57:02.353]  It's great.
[00:57:02.613 --> 00:57:03.174]  I love the energy.
[00:57:03.214 --> 00:57:03.654]  Love you guys.
[00:57:03.674 --> 00:57:03.974]  Love you.
[00:57:03.994 --> 00:57:04.415]  We love you.
[00:57:04.435 --> 00:57:04.835]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:57:05.015 --> 00:57:05.635]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:05.675 --> 00:57:06.116]  Stay with us.
[00:57:05.936 --> 00:57:07.936]   We're gonna go to South Africa where they're murdering all the white people
[00:57:07.936 --> 00:57:24.016]   We're Going to South Africa where they're murdering all the white
[00:57:24.016 --> 00:57:26.016]   people *Distorted*
[00:57:26.016 --> 00:57:30.016]   *Distorted* *Distorted*
[00:57:30.336 --> 00:57:34.336]   *Outro* *Outro*
[00:57:34.336 --> 00:57:38.335]   *Outro* *Outro*
[00:57:38.335 --> 00:57:42.335]   *Outro* *Outro*
[00:57:42.335 --> 00:57:29.469]   *Outro* *Dramatic Music*
[00:57:29.469 --> 00:57:54.469]   *Dramatic Music* *Dramatic Music*
[00:57:54.469 --> 00:58:12.309]   *Dramatic Music* Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United
[00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:13.469]  States government.
[00:58:13.383 --> 00:58:17.146]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[00:58:17.306 --> 00:58:19.607]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[00:58:19.687 --> 00:58:21.448]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:58:22.089 --> 00:58:24.591]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:58:25.411 --> 00:58:29.677]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[00:58:29.877 --> 00:58:33.101]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:58:33.282 --> 00:58:37.227]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on a cold floor.
[00:58:37.307 --> 00:58:39.750]  It was almost as if it were a plan in motion.
[00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:41.032]  It just can't happen.
[00:58:41.392 --> 00:58:45.134]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[00:58:45.174 --> 00:58:47.255]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:58:47.315 --> 00:58:48.896]  They are nothing but distraction.
[00:58:48.936 --> 00:58:51.357]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors.
[00:58:51.737 --> 00:58:53.578]  You silenced those voices.
[00:58:53.618 --> 00:58:57.340]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:04.160]   Soon as we start exposing the great reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:08.160]  [Applause]
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:30.160]  [Music]
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:35.160]   Ladies and gentlemen, my personal pastor, a great American, Rodney Howard Brown, takes over now.
[00:59:35.985 --> 00:59:38.988]  But first, the Star-Spangled Banner at his church about five weeks ago.
[00:59:39.048 --> 00:59:39.589]  Here it is.
[00:59:39.889 --> 00:59:41.889]  Will you all please rise for the Starspangled Banner?
[00:59:41.889 --> 01:00:08.449]   Oh What's so

[01:02:02.825 --> 01:02:03.306]  Amazing!
[01:02:07.159 --> 01:02:11.160]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday edition.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.801]  Such exciting announcements today.
[01:02:13.261 --> 01:02:14.261]  CharlesCrowder.com.
[01:02:14.601 --> 01:02:17.142]  But with the balance of the hour, we've got something very serious to talk about.
[01:02:17.162 --> 01:02:30.406]  He's about to do an emergency mission to, what is it, 10 countries or more in Africa, particularly his home country, South Africa, where the communists have taken control and replaced one evil with something far greater in its magnitude of satanic force.
[01:02:31.926 --> 01:02:33.347]  Black Tribes murdering Black Tribes.
[01:02:33.387 --> 01:02:37.050]  Black Tribes under the direction of the government murdering whites en masse.
[01:02:38.031 --> 01:02:38.691]  Kill the Boer.
[01:02:39.412 --> 01:02:40.853]  All of this in the New York Times, defending it.
[01:02:41.233 --> 01:02:45.657]  This is quite a moment to be alive where they attack songs like Not in a Small Town.
[01:02:46.037 --> 01:02:48.459]  It just calls for unity and self-defense, calling that racist.
[01:02:48.479 --> 01:02:50.320]  But kill white people is a good thing.
[01:02:50.341 --> 01:02:51.521]  This is pure evil.
[01:02:51.922 --> 01:02:57.564]   And Ronnie Howard Brown is about to literally parachute in to this cauldron. So Pastor, thank you for joining us. We'll
[01:02:57.564 --> 01:03:01.983]   cover that first, then the indictment of Trump on January 6th, and the war with
[01:03:01.983 --> 01:03:03.284]  Russia, and all the big developments.
[01:03:03.284 --> 01:03:08.383]   I love you, Pastor. I've known you for many years, but getting to visit your church was one of the highlights of
[01:03:08.383 --> 01:03:08.784]  my life.
[01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:12.784]   I appreciate you and your wife and your whole family and your whole family church,
[01:03:12.784 --> 01:03:15.784]   and the work you're doing. So God bless you. You're a total blessing.
[01:03:15.784 --> 01:03:22.784]   Hey, Alex, it's so great to see you. That was a great night, the night with Alex.
[01:03:23.149 --> 01:03:24.249]  People still talk about it.
[01:03:24.869 --> 01:03:28.371]  And anyway, it was great to see Nick DiPaolo on with you.
[01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:30.032]  He cracks me up.
[01:03:30.832 --> 01:03:34.134]  When I tuned in the pre-thing, I'm looking, there's Nick DiPaolo.
[01:03:34.514 --> 01:03:41.057]  I mean, it looks like you've got a star lineup of what you're doing now, this next whole phase of what's going to happen.
[01:03:41.117 --> 01:03:42.558]  It's going to be pretty phenomenal.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.541]  So but honored to be on with you today.
[01:03:45.561 --> 01:03:49.082]  And yeah, what's happening in South Africa is crazy.
[01:03:49.382 --> 01:03:53.383]  But this has been going on for the longest of times.
[01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:55.964]  So all of this is another wave.
[01:03:56.284 --> 01:04:05.347]  And of course, it only gains attention when you see Julius Malema in front of 100,000 people singing Kill the Boer, the Boer.
[01:04:07.583 --> 01:04:13.525]  But this has been the modus operandi for a long time, and you can see all those white flanks that they just showed.
[01:04:14.005 --> 01:04:15.766]  That's for every farmer that got killed.
[01:04:15.806 --> 01:04:19.247]  Right after this event, they went and killed an elderly couple.
[01:04:19.367 --> 01:04:22.468]  And I mean, Alex, the pictures are so grotesque.
[01:04:22.548 --> 01:04:31.749]   Basically, they're taking, they'll take the man, they'll tie him up, They will cut his eyelids off so that he can't close his eyelids.
[01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:34.611]  Then they will rape his wife in front of him.
[01:04:34.631 --> 01:04:37.654]  They'll gang rape his wife and then cut her throat.
[01:04:38.094 --> 01:04:40.937]  But they'll dismember her slowly before they kill her.
[01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:43.879]  So that he watches this total torture.
[01:04:43.919 --> 01:04:45.080]  They take the children.
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.803]  They will boil them in hot water.
[01:04:48.613 --> 01:04:51.274]  And, of course, often they've raped a kid and done whatever.
[01:04:51.334 --> 01:04:55.094]  So, now, the father is sitting there, he has to watch this.
[01:04:55.134 --> 01:04:57.415]  He can't look in, he can't close his eyes.
[01:04:57.435 --> 01:04:59.595]  By the way, this is admitted mainstream news.
[01:05:00.056 --> 01:05:02.676]  This is, I don't mean to interrupt, Pastor, this is admitted mainstream.
[01:05:02.976 --> 01:05:05.717]  They defend boiling of children and the raping.
[01:05:05.757 --> 01:05:08.938]  I mean, this is, this is, this is, this is the standard protocol.
[01:05:09.258 --> 01:05:14.839]  Winnie Mandela, it was burn children up in tires, put a tire around their neck, necklacing.
[01:05:14.879 --> 01:05:15.519]  So, please continue.
[01:05:17.088 --> 01:05:18.969]  Yeah, so this has been going on for a long time.
[01:05:19.049 --> 01:05:20.689]  This is not something that's new.
[01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:34.995]  It just gained attention now because of that big scene of 100,000 in the stadium, and then Julius Malema, you know, chanting, or singing, Kill the Bull, which is like a freedom song for them.
[01:05:35.615 --> 01:05:37.456]  So unfortunately, that's just the chant.
[01:05:38.396 --> 01:05:41.277]  But right after that, they started killing some farmers.
[01:05:41.358 --> 01:05:50.152]   So it's a terrible situation, basically, which People can't believe that that would even come to America.
[01:05:50.512 --> 01:05:55.856]  But if they can do this in South Africa, then what are they going to try to do in America in the next 10 years?
[01:05:56.456 --> 01:06:03.582]   Because first of all, People can say, well, it's just a racial thing, white versus black, and killing the farmers.
[01:06:03.682 --> 01:06:07.144]  It's really to destroy all the food supply, which they don't understand.
[01:06:07.504 --> 01:06:12.526]  The only people that are supporting the food supply are the farmers.
[01:06:13.026 --> 01:06:19.249]  So if you can create a situation where you kill all your farmers, they did this in Venezuela, where people are eating dogs.
[01:06:19.509 --> 01:06:21.210]  They're eating anything that they can eat.
[01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:24.371]  It's part, this is what communism does.
[01:06:24.391 --> 01:06:30.113]  It comes in, whoever, and you can look throughout history, Alex, you know this better than anybody else.
[01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:38.257]  You can look through history, they did this in Europe, they did this in countries in Europe, wherever there were farmers, first thing they do, they kill the farmers.
[01:06:38.317 --> 01:06:42.178]  So in South Africa, they use it in the white and black situation.
[01:06:42.658 --> 01:06:48.941]  In other countries, obviously, if it's in Venezuela, it's the own people killing their own people.
[01:06:49.501 --> 01:06:50.942]  But who's going to grow the food?
[01:06:51.182 --> 01:06:52.123]  They don't really care.
[01:06:52.584 --> 01:06:54.265]  Look at America's food supply.
[01:06:54.745 --> 01:06:58.828]  They're destroying cattle, the cattle industry.
[01:06:58.868 --> 01:07:00.610]  They're destroying the chicken industry.
[01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:02.211]  They're destroying everything.
[01:07:02.231 --> 01:07:04.132]  Let me interrupt you because you're so on target.
[01:07:04.152 --> 01:07:04.953]  You live through this.
[01:07:05.774 --> 01:07:08.456]  You're our expert here because you've experienced this and fought this.
[01:07:09.196 --> 01:07:15.838]  If we look at what happened in Zimbabwe, they came in and killed all the white farmers and they starved to death and imploded.
[01:07:16.338 --> 01:07:21.920]  But if you look, you said the Netherlands, or you look at Ireland where they're now getting rid of large portions of the farms.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:26.521]  We have John Kerry saying we got to cut off the farms to save the earth.
[01:07:26.781 --> 01:07:28.782]  They're literally cutting world food supply.
[01:07:29.202 --> 01:07:39.932]  Knowing it will cause unrest and as you pointed out in Rwanda the UN played one animus tribe off against the Christian group that was actually stabilizing things and so they'll play black off against black.
[01:07:40.293 --> 01:07:42.655]  Whatever fissure there is the communists do that.
[01:07:44.412 --> 01:07:45.213]  Yeah, they don't care.
[01:07:45.413 --> 01:07:48.555]  It's just so they can push their agenda later on.
[01:07:48.995 --> 01:07:51.257]  So, but this is not, this has not been stopped.
[01:07:51.277 --> 01:07:54.259]  But now let me just tell you, it's not, it's not everywhere.
[01:07:54.599 --> 01:07:55.800]  It's in certain places.
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:08:03.105]  And of course, the farmers and even the African people have gone as far to actually protect themselves.
[01:08:03.165 --> 01:08:07.088]  So what you are seeing are cases that are taking place.
[01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:08.429]  I'm not taking away from this.
[01:08:09.009 --> 01:08:10.791]  And obviously they haven't started the genocide.
[01:08:10.811 --> 01:08:12.032]  That's why I had you here.
[01:08:12.092 --> 01:08:14.674]  Who are the players?
[01:08:14.694 --> 01:08:15.815]  Because you're an expert.
[01:08:15.835 --> 01:08:16.516]  You were from there.
[01:08:16.956 --> 01:08:18.958]  You go there all the time at your own risk, your own life.
[01:08:19.638 --> 01:08:20.259]  People don't know.
[01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:21.860]  Most of the blacks aren't like this.
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.081]  This is the communists.
[01:08:23.101 --> 01:08:25.984]  So explain who the bad players are, who the good players are.
[01:08:27.405 --> 01:08:31.268]  Yeah, I mean, most of the African people, they don't want any of this.
[01:08:31.848 --> 01:08:39.024]   They love Everybody loves each other, so it's not like, I mean, I'm gonna go there now, I probably won't see any of this.
[01:08:39.624 --> 01:08:50.426]  But there are areas that are targeted, and so the bottom line is that right now in Cape Town, there's a massive killing between the taxis that are going, all the taxis on strike.
[01:08:50.666 --> 01:08:56.007]   They're burning taxis, they're killing people, so Cape Town's in a major thing, it's got nothing to do with the farmers.
[01:08:56.468 --> 01:08:58.508]  It's basically all the taxes going on strike.
[01:08:59.088 --> 01:09:03.749]  On strike, people are sending me footage of them blowing up stuff and what's taking place.
[01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:09.130]  So, I mean, obviously, communism behind it, but I have a different view.
[01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:12.050]  Obviously, everything is controlled out of London, England.
[01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:16.451]  So, Julius Malema, as far as I'm concerned, is controlled out of London, England.
[01:09:16.811 --> 01:09:20.992]  The same as Roma Pauls is controlled out of London, England, because that's the financial capital of the world.
[01:09:21.753 --> 01:09:40.238]  And that's how, if you look, I mean, it's kind of laughable because even when you wrote a 600-page book on this, so explain, you're right, explain London, England, not the people of England, but the Bank of England, the City of England, the City of London, the Financial Center, explain why they want this.
[01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:43.971]  Yeah, because that's global control.
[01:09:44.172 --> 01:09:57.475]  So basically, what started over 200 years ago with the Bank of England became, and now the Federal Reserve of America, which now apparently our debt, the interest on the debt every day is $5 billion a day.
[01:09:57.495 --> 01:09:59.475]  $5 billion USD a day.
[01:09:59.755 --> 01:10:02.496]  That's why our government's not going to do anything to balance the book.
[01:10:02.916 --> 01:10:11.691]   But the bottom line is, these are the people that are really running The planet, they sit behind closed doors, they play a chess game.
[01:10:13.091 --> 01:10:16.092]  I mean, the classic example right now is what's happening in Niger.
[01:10:16.112 --> 01:10:26.876]  Niger, from Nigeria, which I'm going right to the area in Nigeria, that's the first country we're going to, they run the trans-Saharan pipeline all the way to the Mediterranean.
[01:10:27.396 --> 01:10:37.066]   And Niger, The whole disagreement between Nigeria and Niger because Nigeria is backed by, you know, American forces.
[01:10:37.386 --> 01:10:38.766]  Niger is backed by Russia.
[01:10:39.046 --> 01:10:44.968]  So it looks like they're almost taking what failed now in the Ukraine and transferring it to this whole bloc.
[01:10:45.635 --> 01:11:07.196]  In Africa, and you can see the map, I have a map here, if you guys can put it up for me, Mali, Niger, you see all the ones in the green are the ones that are on the one side, but Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea, they're gonna fight with Niger, and this is being backed by China, by Russia, and by North Korea.
[01:11:07.216 --> 01:11:15.441]   So, I mean, we just had the King of Nigeria at our church Sunday morning and night with the Queen, and we talked at length.
[01:11:15.982 --> 01:11:22.966]  You know, he said we really got to pray that none of this stuff tries to penetrate into the country of Nigeria, but this is what's going on.
[01:11:23.386 --> 01:11:35.598]   So, again, I know, and we're talking about South Africa, but the same things happen in Namibia, the same things happen in Zimbabwe, the same thing happens in Mozambique, the same things happen in Zimbabwe.
[01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:46.761]  Really, wherever they can mess up the food supply of people and create a disruption, because then they come in for the mineral wealth that's there.
[01:11:47.141 --> 01:11:53.783]  And this is all about that Niger, it's all about that pipeline that's now feeding the whole of Europe.
[01:11:54.223 --> 01:11:59.350]   So of course, Many of the Africans are saying, we don't want the oil going to the colonialists.
[01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:01.591]  So there's like a whole, there's a whole big thing.
[01:12:01.971 --> 01:12:07.232]  Everything's going back to the days of, you know, Nigeria got independence from England in 1960.
[01:12:07.932 --> 01:12:14.614]  South Africa got independence from, sorry, Nigeria got independence from England in 1960.
[01:12:15.674 --> 01:12:19.355]  South Africa got independence from England in 1961.
[01:12:19.815 --> 01:12:21.596]  But they still controlled everything.
[01:12:21.976 --> 01:12:28.998]   They controlled Imports, they control coal, they control maize, corn, whatever.
[01:12:29.418 --> 01:12:34.360]  Again, I don't understand, if you're making money on the one side, why would you then destroy the supplier?
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:39.282]  It can only be now to plunge the people into a place where their poverty is stricken.
[01:12:39.322 --> 01:12:43.684]  I'm an outsider studying this, and I have experts unlike you, but it's very simple.
[01:12:43.704 --> 01:12:54.508]   You have mega banks that are still the colonialists, that if they can cause a race war, they can rob everybody, and as you've said, And I'm not an apologist for black racism in South Africa, but you said it's global funded.
[01:12:54.548 --> 01:12:58.851]  If you look all over Africa, where you come and speak to the presidents, everybody, they're all talking about it.
[01:12:58.871 --> 01:13:00.712]  They refuse the COVID shots more than anybody.
[01:13:01.032 --> 01:13:02.193]  They know about the New World Order.
[01:13:02.213 --> 01:13:03.393]  They're making deals with Russia.
[01:13:03.813 --> 01:13:10.377]  It seems like Africans are some of the most awake people other than these communist enclaves that the British intel controls.
[01:13:12.327 --> 01:13:17.990]  Which we're finding out now, and I'll be able to better report to you after the 10-country tour.
[01:13:18.370 --> 01:13:22.672]  I'm actually gone five and a half weeks, Alex, so it's going to be a run.
[01:13:22.692 --> 01:13:43.916]   I have a team of 19 people with me, and we stop in Nigeria, we go on to Ethiopia, then we're in Kenya, and then we go down to Malawi, then South Africa, and then we go to Swaziland, then to Namibia, and then from Namibia we go to Zambia, then Botswana, and then on to Uganda, and then home.
[01:13:44.456 --> 01:13:50.879]  And we were going to Lesotho, but the airport can't service the aircraft.
[01:13:50.919 --> 01:13:52.980]  They can't even fuel the aircraft or whatever.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:59.663]  I mean, it shows you how the infrastructure of a major country, broken down, when you can fly in there with a plane, and they say, we can't help you.
[01:14:00.323 --> 01:14:07.206]  So, you have to fly in with tiny planes, and, you know, be able to handle yourself and fly out without refueling.
[01:14:07.767 --> 01:14:11.921]   So, You just watch, and then you talk to some of these kings.
[01:14:12.341 --> 01:14:18.244]  Some of the presidents tell me, we have lithium in our country, and the Chinese are coming and they want our lithium.
[01:14:18.745 --> 01:14:21.366]  And we've got this mineral, or that mineral.
[01:14:22.207 --> 01:14:26.849]  One of the pastors that I'm going to see has just bought three massive combine harvesters.
[01:14:27.369 --> 01:14:30.271]  And I haven't talked to him in 20 years, so I'm going to be with him.
[01:14:30.731 --> 01:14:31.612]  He's in Uganda.
[01:14:32.172 --> 01:14:42.298]  And he's just put, I don't know how many square miles, he told me, and put it under cultivation for maize, I believe it is.
[01:14:42.818 --> 01:14:45.359]  And so we were talking at length on the phone.
[01:14:45.439 --> 01:14:47.000]  So they are awake.
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.161]  People are awake.
[01:14:48.181 --> 01:14:49.041]  They don't know what to do.
[01:14:49.061 --> 01:14:50.882]  They said, what do we do with the Russians?
[01:14:52.443 --> 01:14:53.643]  And I'm not being politically correct.
[01:14:54.104 --> 01:14:55.324]  Liberals claim they love black people.
[01:14:55.344 --> 01:14:55.764]  They don't.
[01:14:56.044 --> 01:14:57.265]  They're trying to kill them and destroy them.
[01:14:57.665 --> 01:15:03.707]  You're saying, that's what I've seen from the news, but you're the expert, the majority of folks want Christ, want freedom, get what's going on.
[01:15:04.047 --> 01:15:06.428]  It's only these communist command bases that are going on.
[01:15:06.488 --> 01:15:08.589]  So the Africans are our friends overall.
[01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:11.270]  Yeah, totally.
[01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:12.471]  They're not enemies.
[01:15:13.031 --> 01:15:15.732]  And the problem is, so here's the problem, Alex.
[01:15:15.832 --> 01:15:23.556]   I mean, we can call the communists the problem, but when you see how our country's been taken over, Then you have to see, okay, so...
[01:15:24.688 --> 01:15:29.012]  There's elements, I'm not saying the whole of the FBI is bad, but a lot is bad.
[01:15:29.492 --> 01:15:32.114]  And I'm not saying the whole of the CIA is bad, but a lot is bad.
[01:15:32.154 --> 01:15:40.241]  So there's the communist element that's taken over the CIA, the FBI, or the State Department, and that's what's now having effect.
[01:15:40.581 --> 01:15:43.043]  So if you go to Africa, people say, well, who's doing it?
[01:15:43.063 --> 01:15:44.865]  Well, it's really the State Department doing this.
[01:15:45.245 --> 01:15:45.946]  Well, who's doing this?
[01:15:46.166 --> 01:15:51.850]  Well, it's members of the FBI or CIA or rogue element, rogue mercenaries.
[01:15:52.111 --> 01:15:53.572]  Well, who's paying the mercenary?
[01:15:54.457 --> 01:15:59.948]  They're funded by some Soros-backed organization.
[01:16:00.583 --> 01:16:07.647]  Pushing vaccines, which everything leads to sterilization of tribes, and it goes on and on.
[01:16:08.048 --> 01:16:09.949]  So they want to control everything.
[01:16:09.989 --> 01:16:11.570]  They want to control the movement of people.
[01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:13.611]  They want to control how many babies you have.
[01:16:13.971 --> 01:16:15.192]  They want to control what you eat.
[01:16:15.652 --> 01:16:26.339]  And then you can see everything coming with... They were saying that a cockroach milk is now more nutritionist, more nutrition in a cockroach milk than in milk.
[01:16:27.317 --> 01:16:28.038]  I saw that, guys.
[01:16:28.118 --> 01:16:29.259]  I bet they covered that last week.
[01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:33.021]  Cockroach milk, folks, which tightens pure poison.
[01:16:34.042 --> 01:16:35.243]  Guys, Google cockroach milk.
[01:16:35.263 --> 01:16:36.023]  He's not making it up.
[01:16:37.604 --> 01:16:39.666]  Imagine a cockroach milk latte.
[01:16:42.068 --> 01:16:47.289]  And then, people are eating crickets and every kind of bug.
[01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:49.089]  We were never meant to eat that.
[01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:54.311]  And these things carry all kinds of parasites and every kind of thing known to man.
[01:16:54.351 --> 01:16:58.712]  So, basically, it just plunges people into sickness and disease, which they're happy about.
[01:16:58.732 --> 01:16:59.052]  There you are.
[01:16:59.572 --> 01:17:00.213]  Cockroach milk.
[01:17:00.273 --> 01:17:01.213]  Yes, you read that right.
[01:17:03.073 --> 01:17:04.474]  Oh, Alex, that sounds yum.
[01:17:04.554 --> 01:17:05.674]  Wouldn't you like a cockroach?
[01:17:06.274 --> 01:17:08.295]  Alex, don't you want a cockroach milk latte?
[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.901]  Well, Pastor, you are so smart.
[01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:13.721]  I'm not kissing your butt.
[01:17:13.741 --> 01:17:13.921]  It's true.
[01:17:13.941 --> 01:17:15.022]  You're one of the smartest people I know.
[01:17:15.062 --> 01:17:16.463]  Like, you've advised me over the years.
[01:17:16.523 --> 01:17:17.463]  Everything you said came true.
[01:17:17.483 --> 01:17:28.088]  So when we come back, I want to try to give you the floor and just run the gambit here of Trump's January 6th indictment, what's happening, the economy, the dollar in the U.S.
[01:17:28.128 --> 01:17:32.790]  government being devalued by the credit score agencies, and just where we are.
[01:17:32.830 --> 01:17:37.933]  But before we go any further, when we come back from break, I sent the crew, I meant to give it to them earlier, but I just gave it to them right now.
[01:17:38.953 --> 01:17:41.954]  Well, I think just the plan that they have for America.
[01:17:41.974 --> 01:17:43.395]  Now, I personally believe it's failing.
[01:17:43.215 --> 01:17:47.775]   that to Scott, the crew, we can grab that and get that to the computer. I want to
[01:17:47.775 --> 01:17:50.454]   come back and play that next segment, but we got a minute and a half to break.
[01:17:50.454 --> 01:17:56.015]   Pastor Brown, what else are you gonna dial us into when we return?
[01:17:56.015 --> 01:18:00.654]   Well, I think just the plan that they have for America. Now, I personally believe
[01:18:00.654 --> 01:18:07.135]   it's failing, and then you can bounce, you can tell me, hey, I personally feel the
[01:18:07.135 --> 01:18:12.494]   plan that they had has failed hopelessly because 2020 was supposed to totally
[01:18:12.494 --> 01:18:14.494]  locked us down and never opened us up.
[01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:15.911]  But here we are.
[01:18:15.951 --> 01:18:16.431]  This is 2023.
[01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:17.151]  This is August.
[01:18:17.592 --> 01:18:18.753]  I'm talking to Alex Jones.
[01:18:19.814 --> 01:18:21.195]  And I'm hearing you here.
[01:18:21.495 --> 01:18:23.216]  So that means the plan has failed.
[01:18:23.677 --> 01:18:29.001]  If you and I were bye-bye, then maybe they would have been further down the road.
[01:18:29.441 --> 01:18:36.303]   But it's not just us, because there's thousands of other voices that even if We were not here.
[01:18:37.143 --> 01:18:38.584]  Others would rise in our place.
[01:18:38.804 --> 01:18:39.764]  People are awake.
[01:18:40.344 --> 01:18:41.085]  Everywhere you go.
[01:18:41.225 --> 01:18:42.245]  Across California.
[01:18:42.686 --> 01:18:44.606]  Across Washington State.
[01:18:45.267 --> 01:18:45.827]  It doesn't matter.
[01:18:45.907 --> 01:18:46.647]  Even in New York.
[01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:47.948]  People are not stupid.
[01:18:48.268 --> 01:18:49.429]  They know what's going on.
[01:18:49.729 --> 01:18:51.370]  And they see through everything right now.
[01:18:51.450 --> 01:18:55.232]  So, my advice to the globalists, you guys better back off.
[01:18:55.752 --> 01:18:58.093]  You just back off and maybe wait for 40 years.
[01:18:59.571 --> 01:19:04.133]  And just leave it alone for now, because you're not going to get what you want done right at this juncture.
[01:19:04.353 --> 01:19:04.893]  It's failing.
[01:19:05.414 --> 01:19:11.876]  And I know you want to kill the dollar, but unfortunately you're not able to kill the dollar for several reasons.
[01:19:12.337 --> 01:19:12.777]  Because...
[01:19:13.633 --> 01:19:20.837]  You have too much committed in the dollar, and if you do kill the dollar at this juncture, somebody said, well, they'll change to digital.
[01:19:21.078 --> 01:19:23.479]  These whole countries, they can't even get digital.
[01:19:23.839 --> 01:19:26.461]  These whole nations, they can't even function off of digital.
[01:19:26.901 --> 01:19:28.382]  There's even parts of America that can't function.
[01:19:28.402 --> 01:19:28.942]  That's right, Brown.
[01:19:28.962 --> 01:19:30.623]  Pastor Brown, stay there.
[01:19:30.643 --> 01:19:31.484]  They jumped the gun.
[01:19:31.504 --> 01:19:32.785]  We're going to come right back, give you the floor.
[01:19:32.845 --> 01:19:36.607]  You are dead on about the ESGs, the central bank digital currencies, and so much more.
[01:19:36.947 --> 01:19:38.368]  Revival.com.
[01:19:38.428 --> 01:19:39.529]  Revival.com.
[01:19:39.849 --> 01:19:41.430]  Check out the URL, Revival.com.
[01:19:42.737 --> 01:19:54.902]  You know, everything nowadays is niche audiences, and so Rodney Howard Brown reaches tens of millions of people a week, so do we, but we need to get all those groups together to understand what's happening.
[01:19:55.442 --> 01:19:59.070]   Here's just a quick little Prelude video.
[01:19:59.170 --> 01:20:03.792]  We'll go back to Pastor Brown about his big Africa trip that's coming up that is extremely dangerous.
[01:20:03.812 --> 01:20:05.113]  He doesn't make that point, but we are.
[01:20:05.293 --> 01:20:07.354]  Pray for him and pray for his ministry.
[01:20:07.394 --> 01:20:16.479]  He's got hundreds of churches around the world, many of them in Africa, many of them in Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and it really is people need Jesus right now.
[01:20:16.559 --> 01:20:18.581]  That's the answer to this open satanic system.
[01:20:18.621 --> 01:20:19.541]  It's always been the answer.
[01:20:20.302 --> 01:20:22.043]  Here's where he's going in just a few weeks.
[01:20:22.523 --> 01:20:24.044]  We need to pray for Pastor Brown and his team.
[01:20:24.064 --> 01:20:24.364]  Here it is.
[01:20:27.412 --> 01:20:35.554]  It's not by the efforts of one, but by the combined efforts of many.
[01:20:35.594 --> 01:20:37.655]  You're going to reach people that nobody else can reach.
[01:20:37.715 --> 01:20:40.775]  I'm going to mobilize every single person here to win souls.
[01:20:41.916 --> 01:20:43.416]  God preserved you for this moment.
[01:20:43.956 --> 01:20:48.837]  The glory of God is going to run through this land, so much so that it shall shake every realm.
[01:20:49.477 --> 01:20:51.578]  Shaking it to the very core.
[01:20:52.038 --> 01:20:55.139]  And there's nothing that can ever stop it.
[01:20:57.295 --> 01:20:58.857]  I'll come and light a fire and watch it burn.
[01:20:59.878 --> 01:21:01.300]  God's not finished with Africa.
[01:21:03.262 --> 01:21:08.749]  In the divine atmosphere of heaven, the Lord will forge in you that which He wants you to do.
[01:21:08.769 --> 01:21:12.233]  And the grace to carry the mantle will be upon your life.
[01:21:12.974 --> 01:21:15.614]  God has changed you up for this hour.
[01:21:15.614 --> 01:21:32.653]   Alright, and there's a longer promo I have where he goes over the 10 countries he's going to.
[01:21:32.653 --> 01:21:36.094]   And I remember a video we played five weeks ago where he said in the 90s,
[01:21:36.094 --> 01:21:41.134]   "God's told me there's gonna be a great awakening coming in the next few decades
[01:21:41.134 --> 01:21:43.734]  to this global New World Order system.
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:49.664]  He didn't just start fighting the New World Order five years ago or 10 years ago, but even before I started, he was on air in 93, 92, 94.
[01:21:52.446 --> 01:22:16.292]  Talking about all this, so give us 35,000 foot or the million mile view if you'd like, about where we are, and let's plow through, because I could ask a thousand questions, Pastor, I love you to death, and you've got Holy Ghost anointing and just great discernment just about where the world is, what's happening, what we can all do to get ready for what we're about to go through, their attempts to crash the dollar, the devaluation of the UST bills, I mean, big things are happening.
[01:22:16.332 --> 01:22:20.393]  They now admit on CNN, I have the clip, that the Ukrainians have been completely destroyed.
[01:22:20.413 --> 01:22:21.973]  Where does that come next?
[01:22:22.233 --> 01:22:22.813]  Pastor Brown.
[01:22:24.854 --> 01:22:29.195]  I mean, we all know the Ukraine story is a total flop.
[01:22:29.255 --> 01:22:37.538]  I mean, there were there were pictures yesterday of everybody just chilling out in Kiev, you know, Kiev.
[01:22:38.118 --> 01:22:40.839]  And it looks like they're in the middle of a war.
[01:22:40.979 --> 01:22:45.561]  So the bottom line is, as you know, Russia has been fine.
[01:22:45.581 --> 01:22:46.921]  They've been arguing for years.
[01:22:47.341 --> 01:22:48.702]  This is just a whole ploy.
[01:22:49.342 --> 01:22:52.885]  Money laundering operation and a weapons laundering operation.
[01:22:52.925 --> 01:23:08.997]  So many of the weapons that went through there, that's why they keep asking for more, but those weapons that landed went straight in there, and I'm hearing from African leaders, there's weapons, there's new weapons coming in our country, coming into Sudan, coming into... Oh, it's been confirmed, Al-Qaeda's getting them!
[01:23:09.118 --> 01:23:13.341]  Al-Qaeda and the Mexican coyotes are getting them, that's confirmed!
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:19.121]  Yeah, so it's a big laundering operation.
[01:23:19.161 --> 01:23:21.721]  I mean, it's like everything coming out of our country.
[01:23:22.442 --> 01:23:32.684]  It's almost laughable when you think about what's taking place because nobody would believe that America could turn this corrupt.
[01:23:33.264 --> 01:23:35.484]  And you can just see everything from the January 6th.
[01:23:35.804 --> 01:23:40.706]   I mean, I was watching Mike Pence, you know, That guy.
[01:23:41.707 --> 01:23:42.387]  What a traitor.
[01:23:42.407 --> 01:23:48.789]  I was watching Mike Pence, just like, you know, he was there with President Trump.
[01:23:48.829 --> 01:23:54.050]  He knows what he was supposed to do, was send the electors back and give them two weeks to decide.
[01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:55.410]  That's all Trump asked him to do.
[01:23:55.710 --> 01:23:59.311]  And that was in the law that they were allowed to do that.
[01:23:59.492 --> 01:24:00.972]  America just had not used that.
[01:24:01.616 --> 01:24:06.578]  And so, but Congress rewrote the law so that the Vice President couldn't do that.
[01:24:06.638 --> 01:24:14.302]  So if they rewrote the law, then there must have been something in effect to where he could have done it, and all he needed to do is say, no, be back in two weeks.
[01:24:14.902 --> 01:24:15.803]  Be back in two weeks.
[01:24:16.403 --> 01:24:20.565]  Because January the 6th wasn't the time when the President is sworn in.
[01:24:21.508 --> 01:24:27.874]  He was sworn in weeks later, so they would have had enough time to go back and make sure that everything was fine.
[01:24:28.035 --> 01:24:28.956]  And they didn't do that.
[01:24:29.276 --> 01:24:32.299]  And now I see that he wants to testify against Trump.
[01:24:32.759 --> 01:24:41.048]  I don't even think Pence will even win dog catcher in some small county in Indiana.
[01:24:41.648 --> 01:24:42.109]  Seriously.
[01:24:42.788 --> 01:24:44.250]  We'll talk about election meddling.
[01:24:44.290 --> 01:24:48.015]  How do you testify against somebody you're running against?
[01:24:48.035 --> 01:24:53.162]  Since you mentioned it, here's a clip of him a month ago with Tucker Carlson, where Tucker says, what about the dying vets?
[01:24:53.182 --> 01:24:53.963]  What about the fentanyl?
[01:24:53.983 --> 01:24:55.185]  What about the collapsing America?
[01:24:55.205 --> 01:24:56.426]  200 billion in Ukraine?
[01:24:56.466 --> 01:24:57.848]  He says, none of my concern.
[01:24:57.888 --> 01:24:58.229]  Here it is.
[01:24:58.849 --> 01:25:03.830]  Every city in the United States has become much worse over the past three years.
[01:25:04.330 --> 01:25:04.991]  Drive around.
[01:25:05.031 --> 01:25:08.011]  There's not one city that's gotten better in the United States.
[01:25:08.452 --> 01:25:09.492]  And it's visible.
[01:25:09.872 --> 01:25:11.392]  Our economy has degraded.
[01:25:11.772 --> 01:25:13.293]  The suicide rate has jumped.
[01:25:13.673 --> 01:25:17.894]  Public filth and disorder and crime have exponentially increased.
[01:25:18.769 --> 01:25:26.677]  And yet, your concern is that the Ukrainians, a country most people can't find on a map, who've received tens of billions of U.S.
[01:25:26.717 --> 01:25:28.399]  tax dollars, don't have enough tanks.
[01:25:28.739 --> 01:25:32.603]  I think it's a fair question to ask, like, where's the concern for the United States in that?
[01:25:32.764 --> 01:25:33.885]  Well, it's not my concern.
[01:25:37.148 --> 01:25:38.790]  No, it's not my concern.
[01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:40.772]  Talk about that arrogance.
[01:25:42.742 --> 01:25:43.182]  Unbelievable.
[01:25:43.463 --> 01:25:47.425]  Did you see what General Killong released a statement about Mike Pence?
[01:25:47.465 --> 01:25:48.126]  Did you see that?
[01:25:48.306 --> 01:25:51.688]  I actually tweeted this and he wrote this.
[01:25:51.728 --> 01:25:54.950]  This is General... Let me try to get this thing to go bigger.
[01:25:56.211 --> 01:25:58.292]  He says, yeah, my statement on Pence.
[01:25:58.452 --> 01:25:59.493]  This is General Killong.
[01:25:59.953 --> 01:26:04.096]  I've worked alongside many leaders in my years of service to this nation.
[01:26:04.496 --> 01:26:15.782]   Among them, President Donald J. Trump stands apart as a figure of unwavering determination, a deep vision for America, And the courage to take a stand where others wilt.
[01:26:16.262 --> 01:26:27.326]  His bold and dramatic leadership style during his presidency resulted in significant achievements for our country, which Nancy Pelosi says if he wins again, America will cease to exist.
[01:26:27.726 --> 01:26:28.326]  Right, Nancy?
[01:26:28.367 --> 01:26:29.687]  There's a home waiting for you.
[01:26:30.007 --> 01:26:30.807]  Your room is ready.
[01:26:31.348 --> 01:26:38.270]  Anyway, for a period of time in the White House, I served as National Security Advisor to Vice President Pence.
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:46.565]  While I respect his service to the nation, I must express my disappointment in his recent actions regarding President Trump.
[01:26:46.784 --> 01:26:52.864]   He's not the decisive leader that we've seen from President Trump.
[01:26:52.864 --> 01:26:57.345]   Where President Trump is bold and unafraid to challenge the status quo.
[01:26:57.744 --> 01:27:02.426]  Pence has often chosen the passive route, avoiding confrontation.
[01:27:03.046 --> 01:27:20.774]  This lack of assertiveness combined with overall reliance on failed political consultants, which that's terrible, like Max Short, has determined a liaise fair leadership style of unworthy of the presidency.
[01:27:21.094 --> 01:27:27.932]   While President Trump has constantly put America first, prioritizing our citizens, our economy,
[01:27:27.932 --> 01:27:33.573]   and a global standing, Pence's action have often seemed more focused on political maneuvering
[01:27:33.573 --> 01:27:35.253]  and maintaining his image.
[01:27:35.253 --> 01:27:38.253]  That is not what Republican voters want.
[01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:42.573]   President Trump's dedication to the prosperity and security of the United States
[01:27:42.573 --> 01:27:45.413]  is unwavering as his vision for the future.
[01:27:45.505 --> 01:27:47.866]  I believe in the future of President Trump's envision.
[01:27:48.186 --> 01:27:50.547]  A future that demands bold and decisive leadership.
[01:27:50.867 --> 01:27:56.410]  Something we have seen President Trump, but not from former Vice President Pence.
[01:27:56.610 --> 01:27:59.827]   So I mean that that's like Boom, there it goes.
[01:28:00.188 --> 01:28:06.875]  And now, I'm watching, and I love our governor, I mean, thank God for Governor Ron Sanchez here in Florida.
[01:28:07.175 --> 01:28:10.038]  But now, he's like, totally gone.
[01:28:10.378 --> 01:28:14.543]  You would think Ron and Pence were friends, the way they talk about everything.
[01:28:14.783 --> 01:28:18.307]  Pence says, I will testify against Donald Trump.
[01:28:19.182 --> 01:28:19.603]  Uh, really?
[01:28:20.363 --> 01:28:21.264]  How do you even do that?
[01:28:21.424 --> 01:28:22.405]  So what's he trying to do?
[01:28:22.465 --> 01:28:26.067]  Position himself as if he thinks now Democrats are going to vote for him?
[01:28:26.087 --> 01:28:27.048]  They don't like Pence.
[01:28:27.428 --> 01:28:29.149]  Because Pence is against abortion.
[01:28:29.490 --> 01:28:30.751]  Pence is against abortion.
[01:28:31.131 --> 01:28:33.793]  He's against homosexuality or the gay movement.
[01:28:34.133 --> 01:28:39.997]  So now, you think that Democrats are going to jump the fence and now vote for you?
[01:28:40.017 --> 01:28:40.978]  Nah.
[01:28:41.258 --> 01:28:43.600]  You will always be known as a traitor.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.043]  From now to the time you die, you'll be known as a traitor.
[01:28:49.002 --> 01:28:51.423]  A Benedict Arnold, a traitor.
[01:28:52.443 --> 01:28:52.763]  That's it.
[01:28:53.903 --> 01:29:08.627]  And then, as I said, when you were with me, I think now seven weeks ago, probably seven or eight, and we talked about it at length, our governor needs to just step this one out, which I mean, I don't think he's showing anything in the polls, and wait to 2028.
[01:29:10.643 --> 01:29:32.306]   If there's anything there for him to run for because I'm just promise you right now if they get what they want if they if Biden somebody said well Biden's not fit to run if they put Kamala in or they bring big Mike back You know, I mean, who knows what they're going to do with this thing.
[01:29:32.346 --> 01:29:33.386]  You have no clue.
[01:29:33.866 --> 01:29:34.867]  But they don't really care.
[01:29:35.147 --> 01:29:39.368]  As you know, Klaus Schwab says, we're coming to a time when we're not going to have elections anymore.
[01:29:39.668 --> 01:29:43.129]  We'll just know who's supposed to be there and who's supposed to be in power.
[01:29:43.329 --> 01:29:44.349]  Well, that's not how America works.
[01:29:44.369 --> 01:29:46.429]  And by the way, since you mentioned that, it's too powerful.
[01:29:47.349 --> 01:29:50.570]  Since you mentioned it's too powerful, guys, I played it last Friday.
[01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:58.184]   Get Klaus Schwab saying he was talking to Sergei Brin of Google, the co-founder, and Sergei Brin's nodding.
[01:29:58.605 --> 01:29:59.947]  We're just not going to have elections now.
[01:30:00.107 --> 01:30:02.311]  AI will decide how you're going to vote and tell you.
[01:30:02.331 --> 01:30:04.875]  I mean, it's a total borg.
[01:30:05.456 --> 01:30:05.917]  Give up.
[01:30:05.957 --> 01:30:06.738]  We're going to roll over you.
[01:30:06.778 --> 01:30:07.920]  While they get that clip.
[01:30:08.962 --> 01:30:11.945]  What do you make of Jack Smith and this January 6th indictment?
[01:30:12.005 --> 01:30:15.908]  I mean, they're... Trump is, like, triple down, quadruple down.
[01:30:15.928 --> 01:30:18.390]  He is just totally annihilating them.
[01:30:18.410 --> 01:30:19.471]  They're trying to gag him.
[01:30:20.231 --> 01:30:25.015]  Spirit level, gut level, not even temporal, not even... As a human, great analysis.
[01:30:25.095 --> 01:30:31.641]  What does the Holy Spirit tell you right now, first response, which he always knows the best, from the Holy Spirit, what's going to happen to Trump?
[01:30:33.923 --> 01:30:34.083]  I mean...
[01:30:34.924 --> 01:30:45.008]  I don't know what's going to happen with Georgia, because Georgia might be a little different, because they want to even do a mugshot with Georgia when he goes to, when they indict him, his fourth indictment.
[01:30:45.686 --> 01:30:48.247]  When they dyed him for the fourth time, he has to go there.
[01:30:48.267 --> 01:30:49.887]  They want to do a mugshot fingerprints.
[01:30:50.487 --> 01:30:52.888]  So, obviously, it's going to be a little different than what just happened.
[01:30:53.388 --> 01:30:56.349]  Pelosi says that when he landed in D.C.
[01:30:56.409 --> 01:30:57.629]  that he was a scared puppy.
[01:30:57.930 --> 01:30:58.790]  I saw the footage.
[01:30:58.850 --> 01:31:00.050]  He didn't look scared to me.
[01:31:00.210 --> 01:31:09.073]  He was actually at Bedminster playing golf with some friends of mine just before he threw down... Well, Roger Stone, Hank, he says Trump is... He's known him 45 years.
[01:31:09.113 --> 01:31:10.533]  He says Trump is supercharged.
[01:31:11.233 --> 01:31:12.374]  Trump is not a scared puppy.
[01:31:12.654 --> 01:31:12.954]  Yeah.
[01:31:13.846 --> 01:31:17.431]  Okay, I was supposed to be at Bedminster that day, but I couldn't.
[01:31:17.491 --> 01:31:18.713]  Alex, we're getting everything ready.
[01:31:18.773 --> 01:31:19.654]  There's so much happening.
[01:31:19.694 --> 01:31:21.457]  The university just opened this week.
[01:31:22.018 --> 01:31:26.324]  I was there with you when you took the call and got invited by Trump to there.
[01:31:26.364 --> 01:31:26.925]  You couldn't go.
[01:31:28.829 --> 01:31:39.613]  Yeah, so the bottom line is, I think this January the 6th thing filed by our friend there, not our friend, but our friend in D.C., I think it's all going to fail.
[01:31:40.013 --> 01:31:42.674]  I think when it goes to the Supreme Court, they have to throw it out.
[01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:43.674]  There's nothing there.
[01:31:44.215 --> 01:31:45.915]  So basically it's all bogus.
[01:31:46.575 --> 01:31:48.096]  I'm not sure about the Georgia thing.
[01:31:48.156 --> 01:31:50.197]  I don't know what's going to happen with the Georgia deal.
[01:31:50.517 --> 01:31:56.299]  But nonetheless, January the 6th was based on misinformation.
[01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:59.061]  That Russia was Russian collusion.
[01:31:59.121 --> 01:32:00.201]  That's all been proven.
[01:32:00.722 --> 01:32:06.364]  So therefore, if that's all been proven, then January 6th should be null and void at this juncture.
[01:32:06.864 --> 01:32:12.147]  And just, Trump, they already decided that Trump didn't try to overthrow the government.
[01:32:12.167 --> 01:32:16.929]  So how has he been charged for something that has already been decided that he didn't do?
[01:32:17.809 --> 01:32:20.911]  So it's all just a kabuki theater.
[01:32:21.858 --> 01:32:33.823]  Continue doing what they want to do to try to stop him, but he's going up in the polls, the crowds are growing, even though they don't like to admit it, but people are tired of this nonsense, and you know, America's for the underdog.
[01:32:33.843 --> 01:32:35.604]  But you just said it, they're so stupid!
[01:32:36.124 --> 01:32:40.286]  The worst thing they could do in Georgia is perp walk him, or hold him in jail.
[01:32:40.386 --> 01:32:44.808]  Why doesn't the devil... I asked you this when we were having dinner with you and my wife.
[01:32:46.164 --> 01:33:08.769]  Your wife and my wife, and I said, why does the devil, we were talking about prominent people that have been under demonic attack, who weren't even Christians, now made them Christian, and you say, the devil's kind of stupid, he is not omnipresent, he'll just explain that, because, I mean, you and I aren't that smart compared to God, we're nothing, but we're way smarter than the globalists, don't they get that if they perp-walk him and mugshot him, that he goes up ten more points?
[01:33:09.149 --> 01:33:10.669]  I mean, I could, that's easy to say.
[01:33:13.821 --> 01:33:14.742]  Look, who knows?
[01:33:15.002 --> 01:33:16.624]  Look, I just know they're frantic.
[01:33:17.265 --> 01:33:19.267]  So when you're frantic, you do crazy stuff.
[01:33:19.407 --> 01:33:28.318]  And the problem that we have is a legal system that's corrupted that lawyers would even file a frivolous lawsuit based on nothing.
[01:33:29.016 --> 01:33:33.340]  That any person with any intelligence would say this is out of court.
[01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:34.340]  Throw it out.
[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:35.601]  This is based on nothing.
[01:33:36.102 --> 01:33:37.143]  There's nothing here.
[01:33:37.563 --> 01:33:38.123]  Throw it out.
[01:33:38.684 --> 01:33:42.267]  And I mean, you know how they've tried to get Trump.
[01:33:42.627 --> 01:33:44.108]  From before, while he was running.
[01:33:44.528 --> 01:33:46.610]  Trump is this, Trump is that, Trump is this, Trump is that.
[01:33:46.650 --> 01:33:47.531]  He still got elected.
[01:33:48.101 --> 01:34:04.033]  So now, through a virus, or COVID-19, and the whole lockdowns, which again, I just did my news Sunday morning, I played the clip just as a way of remembrance of when Biden was being inaugurated.
[01:34:04.053 --> 01:34:10.638]  There was nobody there, it was just National Guard, probably about 2,000 National Guard there, with about a hundred people present.
[01:34:11.798 --> 01:34:14.919]  And the reporter was saying, is this very surreal today?
[01:34:15.179 --> 01:34:17.720]  We've probably never seen anything like this in American history.
[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:25.563]  There's nobody here and they are now swearing the President in at his inauguration and there's nobody there.
[01:34:26.423 --> 01:34:29.304]  And so, you see that happening now?
[01:34:29.344 --> 01:34:29.964]  Where's Biden?
[01:34:30.244 --> 01:34:31.565]  You don't see him campaigning?
[01:34:31.925 --> 01:34:33.025]  You don't see him doing anything?
[01:34:33.045 --> 01:34:34.806]  He doesn't want to meet with people?
[01:34:34.886 --> 01:34:36.166]  Doesn't want to talk to the press?
[01:34:36.907 --> 01:34:37.567]  Doesn't nothing?
[01:34:38.212 --> 01:34:40.054]  And so that's what's going to take place again.
[01:34:40.234 --> 01:34:50.163]  They're going to try to snow job, and they used... yeah, they... I mean, this is, it's laughable that, and... I totally agree.
[01:34:50.203 --> 01:34:58.891]  Since you mentioned it, Pastor, I want you to get back to that in a moment, but since you mentioned it, I want to back up everything you're saying.
[01:34:59.432 --> 01:35:09.046]   Here is Klaus Schwab a few weeks ago, Saying we're going to have AI decide elections, this predictive system, it'll tell you what you were going to vote.
[01:35:09.126 --> 01:35:10.546]  I mean, talk about a snow job.
[01:35:10.847 --> 01:35:11.887]  Talk about gaslighting.
[01:35:12.767 --> 01:35:14.268]  That sounds insane to the listeners.
[01:35:15.008 --> 01:35:15.648]  It's true, though.
[01:35:15.768 --> 01:35:16.588]  Patrick Brown's right.
[01:35:16.608 --> 01:35:18.709]  I want to back you up because this is so crazy.
[01:35:18.749 --> 01:35:19.049]  Here it is.
[01:35:20.242 --> 01:35:27.447]  So technology now is and digital technologies mainly have an analytical power.
[01:35:27.547 --> 01:35:35.733]  Now we go into a predictive power and we have seen the first examples and your company very much involved into it.
[01:35:36.253 --> 01:35:39.716]  But since the next step could be to go into a prescriptive.
[01:35:40.815 --> 01:35:51.664]  Mode which means You you do not even have to have elections anymore because you can already predict what?
[01:35:51.704 --> 01:35:59.770]  Predict and afterwards you can say why do we need elections because we know what the result will be Can you imagine such a world?
[01:36:03.049 --> 01:36:11.973]  No, Professor Epstein, three years ago before the 2020 election, not Jeffrey Epstein, a different top computer scientist said, Google itself can steal elections.
[01:36:11.993 --> 01:36:16.295]  30-40 point swing by not letting you see conservatives, their ideas, or blocking them.
[01:36:16.795 --> 01:36:17.515]  They did that.
[01:36:17.575 --> 01:36:20.456]  So the meddling is not letting us have the Hunter Biden laptop.
[01:36:20.856 --> 01:36:23.097]  That's emblematic of thousands of things they did.
[01:36:23.538 --> 01:36:31.001]  Blocking 50 million posts on Facebook, talking about COVID being a lie, or the shots being a lie, or the therapeutics being suppressed.
[01:36:31.889 --> 01:36:35.892]  So, here they are, out of one side of their mouth, we don't need elections anymore.
[01:36:35.912 --> 01:36:40.056]  And out of the other side of their mouth, if you question an election, you're a terrorist.
[01:36:40.896 --> 01:36:44.219]  This doesn't seem to be working with the people, Pastor Brown.
[01:36:46.441 --> 01:36:47.522]  People are not buying it.
[01:36:47.962 --> 01:36:53.146]  And hey, that last clip we played where Biden was speaking in his inauguration, Pence was sitting there.
[01:36:53.566 --> 01:36:56.769]  Remember, Pence went that day and said he felt that he should go there.
[01:36:57.149 --> 01:36:59.291]  If you just let it go on, you'll see the back of his head.
[01:37:00.386 --> 01:37:03.012]  It's a wonder he didn't have a fly on that day.
[01:37:03.032 --> 01:37:03.934]  See?
[01:37:03.975 --> 01:37:04.596]  Pants went!
[01:37:05.333 --> 01:37:08.094]  He went to that inauguration.
[01:37:08.554 --> 01:37:17.377]  So, it would seem to me, and let me just say this, when I, do you remember when I broke the story of how they wanted to kill the President?
[01:37:17.857 --> 01:37:19.057]  And that thing went viral?
[01:37:19.498 --> 01:37:26.040]  And I was walking in the Congress, and I met with one of the top Congressmen, and he said they're going to stroke the President now.
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:26.680]  I said, what do you mean?
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:33.102]  They said he's going to have a stroke, and Mike Pence will be President, and Paul Ryan will be Vice President.
[01:37:33.522 --> 01:37:50.695]  And that was all, that was the talk on the Hill 2017 by Republican members of Congress that told me to my face, they said the bill, the health bill that they said was Trump's was actually Paul Ryan's bill that was written.
[01:37:50.715 --> 01:38:05.086]   So I mean, Unfortunately, I went, I walked behind the scenes, I talked to people behind the scenes, and they just said, there were many of the congressmen that were trying to get to Trump, but the people around Trump were blocking Trump from ever hearing what was actually going on in Congress.
[01:38:05.106 --> 01:38:06.466]  Well, that's right, and let me back you up.
[01:38:06.806 --> 01:38:16.689]  At that same time, Brennan and Clapper and a bunch of them had a press conference on C-SPAN, and they said, he'll be gone in a few months, and they said, you mean impeachment?
[01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:17.410]  They said, no.
[01:38:17.930 --> 01:38:19.230]  They meant, you meant assassination?
[01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:20.250]  They just started laughing.
[01:38:20.531 --> 01:38:21.631]  So they were trying it then.
[01:38:23.812 --> 01:38:28.496]  Yeah, and you know, people don't know there were 27 attempts on Trump's life.
[01:38:28.876 --> 01:38:29.997]  27 attempts on his life.
[01:38:30.838 --> 01:38:37.684]  And that's why when you see him stop at a burger joint or a pizza place, it's not because he just loves junk food.
[01:38:38.404 --> 01:38:41.467]  Trump actually likes elegant things.
[01:38:42.173 --> 01:38:44.955]  But there was a reason why he stopped at a burger place.
[01:38:45.396 --> 01:38:48.518]  Because he knew no one knew he was going to stop at that burger place.
[01:38:48.738 --> 01:38:49.639]  It's funny you say that.
[01:38:49.699 --> 01:38:53.142]  I was told by high level Secret Service that Trump said that.
[01:38:53.202 --> 01:38:57.426]  He would send minor aides out to not tell them who it was for.
[01:38:57.766 --> 01:39:02.570]  And that's why he would just eat from local restaurants and fast food because he couldn't trust the food.
[01:39:04.269 --> 01:39:05.870]  Okay, so here's what happened.
[01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:07.090]  I mean, people have told me this.
[01:39:07.130 --> 01:39:16.314]  So they're bringing in a tray full of burgers and then, say, Mike Pompeo would pick up a burger and about to eat it, Trump would grab that from Pompeo.
[01:39:17.426 --> 01:39:24.971]  He would grab that and eat Pompeo's burger because he knew that that burger was safe.
[01:39:25.391 --> 01:39:26.212]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:39:26.672 --> 01:39:27.833]  So Trump's not stupid.
[01:39:28.053 --> 01:39:29.174]  And that's not funny.
[01:39:29.194 --> 01:39:32.836]  The whole history, they'd have poison tasters, the royal families.
[01:39:33.577 --> 01:39:35.738]  The media makes a joke when I say Trump will be assassinated.
[01:39:35.998 --> 01:39:37.179]  Why does he have secret service?
[01:39:37.359 --> 01:39:37.820]  Obviously.
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:39.401]  And that's my next concern.
[01:39:39.421 --> 01:39:40.381]  What does your spirit tell you?
[01:39:40.401 --> 01:39:41.222]  What's the Holy Ghost tell you?
[01:39:41.682 --> 01:39:42.563]  He's going to win.
[01:39:43.063 --> 01:39:44.224]  He's going to pardon himself.
[01:39:45.365 --> 01:39:46.686]  Their next move is assassination.
[01:39:46.706 --> 01:39:47.146]  They're going to try.
[01:39:49.327 --> 01:39:53.148]  Yeah, I mean, I have not even probed that side of things.
[01:39:53.208 --> 01:39:59.110]  I mean, because, you know, I had that open vision where the Lord told me he didn't care who was in the White House and who was in this agency.
[01:40:00.170 --> 01:40:04.092]  I mean, obviously, out of everybody, I like Trump.
[01:40:04.392 --> 01:40:06.793]  I didn't agree with him on anything on the vaccination.
[01:40:06.833 --> 01:40:08.293]  So that's where he lost me.
[01:40:08.833 --> 01:40:15.716]  I stopped watching his rhetoric with him and Fauci and the lady with the scarf.
[01:40:15.776 --> 01:40:16.236]  What's her name?
[01:40:17.185 --> 01:40:19.146]  And so I just couldn't tolerate that.
[01:40:19.186 --> 01:40:30.374]  And Mike Pence, basically when Trump made Pence the head of COVID Commission, he should have let him, if Trump had never been seen, let Pence hang himself with daily reports.
[01:40:32.395 --> 01:40:34.857]  Pence would have hung himself, publicly.
[01:40:36.098 --> 01:40:42.942]  But Trump kept coming in there, so he became the face of COVID when he should have let Pence become the face of COVID.
[01:40:43.122 --> 01:40:44.744]  And that's unfortunate, obviously.
[01:40:45.968 --> 01:40:49.251]  You know, that's one thing that I just took, I can't get over.
[01:40:49.491 --> 01:40:51.132]  It still bothers me immensely.
[01:40:51.613 --> 01:40:54.215]  But there's no doubt the system is after Trump now.
[01:40:54.355 --> 01:40:57.197]  Why are they, Pastor, why are they so scared of Trump?
[01:40:59.278 --> 01:41:03.462]  Because they know that he's dismantling, or was dismantling, everything that they were doing.
[01:41:03.982 --> 01:41:11.508]  And the problem is when you get a leader that speaks openly, plainly, in the language of the people, the people love that.
[01:41:12.008 --> 01:41:20.625]   When a leader gets up and talks, Not what the people want to hear, but what he's being told to from the teleprompter.
[01:41:21.806 --> 01:41:24.450]  I mean, I just saw the tweet from Hillary Clinton.
[01:41:24.751 --> 01:41:30.540]  It just said, yeah, Bidenomics, Bidenomics at work.
[01:41:31.152 --> 01:41:35.556]  And then she lists all these things that Bidenomics has done.
[01:41:35.616 --> 01:41:37.838]  I mean, this was just tweeted just shortly.
[01:41:38.258 --> 01:41:40.080]  Hillary Clinton, if I can find it for you.
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:41.541]  I mean, this is the lies.
[01:41:41.901 --> 01:41:44.043]  This is what's being pushed.
[01:41:44.584 --> 01:41:45.805]  And everybody just believes it.
[01:41:45.885 --> 01:41:47.526]  And mainstream media, of course, carries it.
[01:41:48.487 --> 01:41:51.530]  I'm not able to find that tweet right now, but it's Hillary Clinton.
[01:41:51.570 --> 01:41:53.051]  Well, Pastor, we've only got a few minutes left.
[01:41:54.913 --> 01:42:05.687]  If you can, I know you're on a roller coaster thing in Africa, but anytime you've got a good connection, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 5 hours if you've got it, I really want you to report for us from Africa.
[01:42:07.249 --> 01:42:09.792]  Revival.com, Revival.com, we've only got about 2 minutes.
[01:42:12.119 --> 01:42:13.540]  Well, let me tell you what I've just done.
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:19.983]  I've just got the whole broadcast thing to carry with me to broadcast from whichever country I'm in and to go live.
[01:42:20.483 --> 01:42:26.646]  So, I'll have my team contact your team and say we've got a good connection and that we can come on live.
[01:42:26.766 --> 01:42:28.827]  Now, obviously, we're going to look at the time.
[01:42:28.847 --> 01:42:29.988]  See, we're in the spirit right now.
[01:42:30.048 --> 01:42:31.728]  So, sir, you command my show.
[01:42:31.748 --> 01:42:33.969]  I love you so much and you're doing such a great job.
[01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:35.050]  Anytime.
[01:42:35.110 --> 01:42:35.770]  We can tape it.
[01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:36.551]  We can do it live.
[01:42:37.091 --> 01:42:40.553]  Anytime you've got to dispatch to America, do it obviously at Revival.com.
[01:42:40.573 --> 01:42:41.213]  You're a great church.
[01:42:41.693 --> 01:42:48.825]  But anytime you're ready, you call us with just an hour or so notice whether we're live or not live, or you can send us reports and we will air it here.
[01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:51.390]  Okay, okay.
[01:42:51.670 --> 01:43:01.833]  And listen, Alex, as you know, we tell people all the time, it's time for people to get their heart right with the Lord and invite Jesus into their life, because time is short.
[01:43:01.993 --> 01:43:03.553]  We live in the lost days.
[01:43:03.633 --> 01:43:06.794]  As you read the scripture, Jesus is coming very, very soon.
[01:43:07.354 --> 01:43:08.674]  And somebody said, I don't believe that.
[01:43:08.714 --> 01:43:13.255]  Well, your life put in today, and then he would have come for you, basically.
[01:43:13.595 --> 01:43:17.376]  So if you don't know Jesus right now, just invite him into your heart.
[01:43:17.396 --> 01:43:19.557]  Just say, Dear Lord Jesus, forgive me of my sin.
[01:43:20.257 --> 01:43:21.317]  Wash me in your blood.
[01:43:21.878 --> 01:43:22.678]  Cleanse me now.
[01:43:23.098 --> 01:43:24.719]  From this day, I will serve you.
[01:43:25.299 --> 01:43:27.600]  And from this day, I will follow you and obey you.
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:28.140]  Amen.
[01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:29.540]  Thank you now for saving me.
[01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:31.421]  If you prayed that prayer, that's it.
[01:43:32.101 --> 01:43:33.722]  And we'll help you.
[01:43:33.862 --> 01:43:35.362]  You can go to Revival.com.
[01:43:35.482 --> 01:43:37.923]  We'll send you a free book all about Jesus that will help you.
[01:43:37.943 --> 01:43:39.403]  And Alex, you're doing a great job.
[01:43:39.823 --> 01:43:45.265]  And I see it's like the Lord's moving some big other things around you now.
[01:43:45.805 --> 01:43:47.246]  I'm quite excited about what I see.
[01:43:49.039 --> 01:43:49.399]  I am too.
[01:43:49.419 --> 01:43:50.380]  I love you, Pastor.
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:51.300]  I love you so much.
[01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:56.442]  Revival.com and please, you just, I know you're busy, but please come on from Africa.
[01:43:56.502 --> 01:43:56.903]  We love you.
[01:43:56.923 --> 01:43:58.103]  We appreciate you and your whole crew.
[01:44:00.144 --> 01:44:01.224]  We'll make it a priority.
[01:44:01.424 --> 01:44:07.047]  I'll come to you live from Johannesburg, but that you can mark that down and then some of the other places.
[01:44:07.807 --> 01:44:08.408]  Thank you, sir.
[01:44:08.248 --> 01:44:28.048]  Thanks sir, we'll talk to you soon.
[01:44:28.122 --> 01:44:34.266]  The Chinese model is certainly a very attractive model for quite a number of countries.
[01:44:34.607 --> 01:44:40.510]  Real super hardcore evil demons have taken over and they've already got China and a billion and a half people.
[01:44:40.871 --> 01:44:46.795]  I'm here to meet one of the 10 million people who've seen the dark side of the social credit system.
[01:44:47.635 --> 01:44:58.321]  Investigative journalist Leo Hu, his poor social credit rating has shut down his travel options and confined him to effective house arrest in Chongqing.
[01:44:58.582 --> 01:45:05.986]  WeChat started as a messaging app, then it transformed into Chinese Facebook and then it added a ride-hailing service similar to Uber to its platform.
[01:45:06.286 --> 01:45:09.912]  And then it added banking services to its platform, and now you can use it as an ID.
[01:45:09.972 --> 01:45:15.500]  This will make your life very convenient, but at the same time, it also becomes very convenient for state security to track you.
[01:45:15.961 --> 01:45:18.585]  To combat message interceptions, they talk through emojis.
[01:45:19.026 --> 01:45:21.350]  A half-fallen rose means someone has been arrested.
[01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:23.871]  A dark moon means they're going to prison camps.
[01:45:24.211 --> 01:45:27.693]  A sun emoji means they are alive, and a flower means they have been released.
[01:45:28.154 --> 01:45:32.776]  China is positioning itself to lead the world in artificial intelligence.
[01:45:33.157 --> 01:45:36.419]  Surveillance technology is a key proving ground.
[01:45:36.819 --> 01:45:47.265]  Facial recognition, body scanning, and geo-tracking, matched with your personal data and online behavior, will power the social credit system.
[01:45:47.845 --> 01:45:50.506]  Leaving no dark corner to hide in.
[01:45:50.706 --> 01:45:52.407]  And you can say, well, this is just innovation.
[01:45:52.747 --> 01:45:54.648]  But it's not innovation the way it's being done.
[01:45:54.908 --> 01:45:55.668]  It's absolute tyranny.
[01:45:55.948 --> 01:45:56.869]  And now it's here.
[01:45:57.149 --> 01:45:58.329]  And guess who created the bill?
[01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:59.790]  Senator Blumenthal.
[01:46:00.370 --> 01:46:05.572]  He quarterbacks the government operations against me on record with the Carnegie Endowment and the CIA.
[01:46:06.032 --> 01:46:14.636]  This bill is designed to make sure that they have your home address before you can actually post about anything on the internet.
[01:46:15.156 --> 01:46:16.176]  The bill is Senate Bill 1409.
[01:46:18.116 --> 01:46:20.900]  40 senators have sponsored it, Republicans and Democrats.
[01:46:21.180 --> 01:46:22.682]  This isn't a left or right issue.
[01:46:23.022 --> 01:46:24.364]  This is a speech issue.
[01:46:24.844 --> 01:46:28.989]  And they call the bill the Kids Online Safety Act, or COSA for short.
[01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:34.276]  But in reality, this is some garbage to make sure that they know where you live when you post.
[01:46:34.736 --> 01:46:47.688]  But whether you're a conservative or a liberal or whatever you are, there are so many people going along with the New World Order who even know it's real, but they think, well, I'll just go along with it and I'll have a better lifestyle if I go along with it.
[01:46:47.808 --> 01:46:48.028]  No.
[01:46:48.248 --> 01:46:56.876]  Because we see what is happening in China right now with the social credit score, where the government is monitoring and surveilling all the people from the beginning to end.
[01:46:57.516 --> 01:47:03.762]  Everything that they do, everything, everywhere where they walk, you know, they control everything and they watch everything.
[01:47:04.242 --> 01:47:05.603]  This is the example of a tyranny.
[01:47:05.784 --> 01:47:11.729]  When the government knows everything about you, where you go, what you eat, where you enter, that's a tyrannical system.
[01:47:12.249 --> 01:47:19.516]  And we've seen this system being implemented right now under the leadership of Ursula von der Leyen, slowly but surely in the European Union.
[01:47:20.016 --> 01:47:22.058]  The green certificate was just the first step.
[01:47:22.338 --> 01:47:25.862]  There are a few more proposals right now under debate in the Parliament.
[01:47:26.243 --> 01:47:34.632]  All these things that are creating a system that will monitor, control, supervise, and condition the rights of all the European citizens.
[01:47:35.013 --> 01:47:39.338]  The heart of the market-based system is a worldwide internet ID.
[01:47:40.327 --> 01:47:41.829]  The UN's already standardized it.
[01:47:41.849 --> 01:47:43.331]  Communist China standardized it.
[01:47:43.631 --> 01:47:51.762]  And it's the Internet ID that's tied to your smartphone, your smart devices, your car, your ability to get on airplanes, get hotels, have insurance, have a job.
[01:47:52.062 --> 01:47:55.687]  And then that's tied to your carbon tax, your vaccine passport tax.
[01:47:56.576 --> 01:48:00.458]  That operates against its orders from your social credit score.
[01:48:01.019 --> 01:48:09.963]  The foundation and the structure of the entire system is based on the internet ID that is then tied to your digital ID.
[01:48:10.184 --> 01:48:19.268]   Jeff Bezos, Amazon owned Whole Foods is announcing worldwide in the next three months they're putting palm scanners in ...to be able to buy and sell.
[01:48:19.689 --> 01:48:30.233]  And in many Whole Foods and other grocery stores in Europe, they're already making you scan your phone or your hand to get in to the grocery stores, not just Whole Paycheck, as Whole Foods is known.
[01:48:34.534 --> 01:48:35.675]  That's the coolest thing ever.
[01:48:35.695 --> 01:48:37.535]  So this has already been set up for a long time.
[01:48:37.935 --> 01:48:40.236]  Now they're getting ready to go, oh, you didn't know?
[01:48:40.796 --> 01:48:44.638]  Under law, there's a whole history of what you search and what you do and where you go.
[01:48:45.330 --> 01:49:12.553]   We're talking about a republic that we're losing and it's being destroyed by design and now global corporations think we're a bunch of dumb animals and they'll incentivize accepting the world government cashless society programmable central bank digital currencies and ESG's and the rest of them because we get little credits and little prizes up front to be the first suckers to grease the Listen to me carefully and listen good.
[01:49:13.354 --> 01:49:14.255]  We're all in this together.
[01:49:15.036 --> 01:49:15.837]  Two key words.
[01:49:16.458 --> 01:49:17.419]  Alpha Gal.
[01:49:18.321 --> 01:49:22.026]  Write it down, put it on your refrigerator door, as George Trait would say.
[01:49:22.767 --> 01:49:23.828]  Alpha Gal.
[01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:26.572]  Alpha Gal.
[01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:29.250]  Let me say it five more times.
[01:49:29.770 --> 01:49:34.292]  Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal.
[01:49:34.552 --> 01:49:35.212]  Five more times.
[01:49:35.452 --> 01:49:38.993]  Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal.
[01:49:39.013 --> 01:49:40.333]  Let me say it ten more times.
[01:49:40.773 --> 01:49:46.795]  Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal.
[01:49:48.115 --> 01:49:54.888]   My greatest frustration is that I can talk to the public in the streets of the grocery store.
[01:49:55.789 --> 01:49:56.590]  Or at the gym.
[01:49:57.071 --> 01:49:57.651]  Or at church.
[01:49:59.173 --> 01:49:59.974]  Or at an airport.
[01:50:00.875 --> 01:50:03.038]  And they say, oh my gosh, you predicted everything, it's incredible.
[01:50:03.659 --> 01:50:05.802]  I can have Tucker Carlson, not named, drop and call me.
[01:50:06.523 --> 01:50:08.245]  Joe Rogan, have dinner with him Saturday.
[01:50:09.266 --> 01:50:10.267]  Oh my god, you're right about everything.
[01:50:11.107 --> 01:50:17.431]  And when I looked at Joe, I said, we're eating steaks at Eddie V's, I said, listen, what I really want to do is tell you the next thing that's coming to stop it.
[01:50:17.851 --> 01:50:20.052]  I don't want to tell you what's coming next and then have it happen.
[01:50:20.072 --> 01:50:21.953]  And then, oh my gosh, this guy knows everything.
[01:50:22.253 --> 01:50:25.075]  The enemy tells you what they're going to do.
[01:50:25.835 --> 01:50:33.220]  So when I say Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, Alpha Gal, I'm not trying to be obnoxious.
[01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:37.242]  I want you to write it down and put it on your refrigerator door.
[01:50:37.262 --> 01:50:39.043]  That's how we say it in Texas.
[01:50:40.933 --> 01:50:41.993]  Your refrigerator door.
[01:50:43.794 --> 01:50:45.714]  Because they say you're not going to eat meat anymore.
[01:50:46.894 --> 01:50:47.854]  It's all over the news.
[01:50:49.835 --> 01:50:50.175]  Everywhere.
[01:50:51.215 --> 01:50:53.176]  That suddenly all these people can't eat meat.
[01:50:54.296 --> 01:50:55.836]  I talked about this a few weeks ago.
[01:50:56.296 --> 01:51:01.197]  The crew was like, oh my mom, my dad, my brother, my sister, my cousin can't eat meat anymore, can't eat beef anymore.
[01:51:01.217 --> 01:51:02.817]  They get violently allergic.
[01:51:03.078 --> 01:51:05.198]  Mouth swells up, eyes swell up like a bee stung.
[01:51:06.676 --> 01:51:11.720]  And then when I talked about it yesterday and filed our first big report on it with documents, I told you it was coming.
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:13.581]  Flooded on Twitter.
[01:51:14.222 --> 01:51:14.982]  Millions of views.
[01:51:15.442 --> 01:51:16.863]  Flooded it in full force with emails.
[01:51:17.264 --> 01:51:18.024]  Flooded with calls.
[01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:20.086]  Going by the crew.
[01:51:20.466 --> 01:51:21.227]  Not just that.
[01:51:21.807 --> 01:51:24.949]  I mean, we have six people in the control room.
[01:51:25.149 --> 01:51:25.610]  Six people.
[01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:29.312]  Three of them have family members can't eat meat after they took the Pfizer shot.
[01:51:29.773 --> 01:51:30.113]  Or Moderna.
[01:51:30.871 --> 01:51:39.538]  Which, when we have studies showing you take that, it triggers the alpha-gal in you, that a bunch of vaccines have the alpha-gal triggering protein crystal in it.
[01:51:40.179 --> 01:51:42.441]  But we're not going to just tell you that, like, oh, what are you, a scientist?
[01:51:42.481 --> 01:51:44.102]  No, I just read the scientist reports.
[01:51:45.704 --> 01:51:46.484]  This is what's going on.
[01:51:46.524 --> 01:51:48.466]  And they tell you all over the news, everywhere.
[01:51:48.886 --> 01:51:52.930]  About a month ago, Scott and Thomas, two of the great producers, came in.
[01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:55.132]  They said, hey, they're saying this tick does it.
[01:51:55.987 --> 01:52:06.097]  But the tic is even in areas of the country, it's only like half the country, to the south, to Texas, it's up in the east coast, but it's not in like half the country.
[01:52:06.457 --> 01:52:08.239]  They're getting AlphaGal.
[01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:09.701]  They're getting where they can.
[01:52:09.861 --> 01:52:10.942]  They've been bit by a tic.
[01:52:11.883 --> 01:52:16.427]  Like they said, oh LeBron James just had a heart attack and everybody's having problems from COVID.
[01:52:17.233 --> 01:52:19.015]  You know, the shot protected them.
[01:52:19.035 --> 01:52:20.096]  They don't have proof it's COVID.
[01:52:20.116 --> 01:52:21.537]  They say, well, we think it's COVID.
[01:52:21.577 --> 01:52:22.939]  It's not because you took a shot.
[01:52:23.339 --> 01:52:28.064]  Those statistics show those that took the shot, you know, are having myocarditis and all the other problems.
[01:52:29.546 --> 01:52:29.726]  So.
[01:52:30.666 --> 01:52:33.327]  This is a big deal, so we're here to give you tomorrow's news today.
[01:52:33.627 --> 01:52:34.528]  This has already begun.
[01:52:35.288 --> 01:52:38.569]  We put out a big report yesterday, and enlisters didn't seem to get it.
[01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:46.552]  There's studies saying the COVID shot triggers the protein in you, but a bunch of so-called vaccines they've been given actually cause it.
[01:52:47.113 --> 01:52:55.918]   So there's no debate that a bunch of people, according to the CDC and the FDA's own websites we're going to put on screen for you, Say it again.
[01:52:56.619 --> 01:53:03.525]  They admit, kind of like in October of 2000, before any shots were given, they said it'll cause myocarditis, strokes, heart attacks, blood clots, blah, blah, blah.
[01:53:03.985 --> 01:53:04.505]  Infertility.
[01:53:05.987 --> 01:53:06.447]  They know.
[01:53:06.867 --> 01:53:07.468]  It's the same thing.
[01:53:07.488 --> 01:53:09.129]  So they're telling you, a tick's doing this.
[01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:10.711]  People are like, well, I didn't bathe in the woods.
[01:53:11.111 --> 01:53:11.932]  I haven't been to the park.
[01:53:11.992 --> 01:53:13.513]  Why the hell can I not eat beef now?
[01:53:13.913 --> 01:53:14.754]  Oh, I took a shot.
[01:53:16.445 --> 01:53:19.230]  So when they say you will eat the bugs, folks, you will eat the cockroach milk.
[01:53:19.611 --> 01:53:21.915]  For babies now, it's cockroach protein.
[01:53:21.935 --> 01:53:23.418]  This is all a sick joke on us.
[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:27.025]  They're giving you this cow protein.
[01:53:28.442 --> 01:53:34.085]  This crystal, this bad cow protein, so that then you get violently sick, that's how they're doing it.
[01:53:34.526 --> 01:53:42.270]  Just like glyphosate was because they were spraying it on the wheat, not just to kill the baby plants growing up with corn or soybean, but on the wheat to stop fungus.
[01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:48.353]  You're now ingesting wheat sprayed with this, and they go, oh, suddenly no one can eat wheat.
[01:53:48.434 --> 01:53:49.454]  No folks, you can eat wheat.
[01:53:49.834 --> 01:53:50.895]  You can't eat Roundup.
[01:53:52.645 --> 01:53:54.506]  Remember the famous Roundup executive wouldn't drink it?
[01:53:54.526 --> 01:53:55.326]  He said, I'll drink it.
[01:53:55.346 --> 01:53:55.846]  It's good for you.
[01:53:55.866 --> 01:53:56.267]  I'll drink it.
[01:53:56.287 --> 01:53:56.987]  Well, I'm not crazy.
[01:53:57.707 --> 01:53:58.608]  Cue that clip up.
[01:53:58.668 --> 01:54:02.429]  Roundup lobbyists won't refuse to drink Roundup.
[01:54:02.449 --> 01:54:06.551]  Well, we'll play that because we don't just... We've only played that clip probably 500 times in the last 20 years.
[01:54:07.131 --> 01:54:11.233]  We won't tell you about something unless we show it to you.
[01:54:11.533 --> 01:54:13.654]  We're going to show you the dockets, but here's the big takeaway.
[01:54:15.876 --> 01:54:16.897]  We have the studies.
[01:54:16.977 --> 01:54:18.458]  We have it, but humans don't work that way.
[01:54:18.758 --> 01:54:19.599]  We'll show you studies.
[01:54:19.619 --> 01:54:24.342]  We'll show you CDC, FDA, PubMed, British Medical Journal.
[01:54:24.362 --> 01:54:25.443]  We're going to show you all that.
[01:54:25.743 --> 01:54:26.864]  You can look it up, read it for yourself.
[01:54:27.425 --> 01:54:29.146]  But you know what you really go off of.
[01:54:30.207 --> 01:54:31.868]  Did you get food poisoning at that restaurant?
[01:54:32.108 --> 01:54:32.969]  Was a movie good?
[01:54:33.389 --> 01:54:36.011]  You go off word of mouth, which is the best intel.
[01:54:36.952 --> 01:54:38.052]  They say it's the worst intel.
[01:54:38.453 --> 01:54:39.333]  It's the best intel.
[01:54:40.454 --> 01:54:43.316]  So, like, hey, did that drug work?
[01:54:43.336 --> 01:54:43.917]  Yeah, it worked great.
[01:54:44.177 --> 01:54:44.717]  Did it not work?
[01:54:44.777 --> 01:54:45.278]  It made me sick.
[01:54:46.903 --> 01:54:49.488]  So, we have been flooded and inundated.
[01:54:49.528 --> 01:54:52.775]  It's when I get back tomorrow in studio, I'm driving back as soon as we end the show here.
[01:54:55.039 --> 01:54:58.947]  With people, including the crew, who may be on the show tomorrow if they're willing to do it.
[01:54:59.561 --> 01:55:03.561]   in the control room, because they're all private, I get that, that their own family members
[01:55:03.561 --> 01:55:08.161]   and they themselves, some of them, have taken the shot, cannot eat beef, which is their
[01:55:08.161 --> 01:55:09.161]  main target first.
[01:55:09.161 --> 01:55:11.161]  So you're like, "Oh, I'm not going to quit eating beef."
[01:55:11.161 --> 01:55:12.161]  Oh, really?
[01:55:12.161 --> 01:55:13.161]  You're not going to quit eating beef?
[01:55:13.161 --> 01:55:14.161]  We'll show you.
[01:55:14.161 --> 01:55:18.841]  We already got half the people not to eat flour or wheat.
[01:55:18.841 --> 01:55:20.400]  So this is a big deal, folks.
[01:55:20.888 --> 01:55:21.788]  This is a big deal.
[01:55:21.828 --> 01:55:22.909]  This is the next big thing.
[01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:27.092]  So please don't let me, once it gets super bad, go, God, he was right.
[01:55:27.112 --> 01:55:27.812]  They're now admitting this.
[01:55:28.173 --> 01:55:30.394]  Let's stop it now, together.
[01:55:30.414 --> 01:55:32.616]  Because we're all watching each other's backs here.
[01:55:33.557 --> 01:55:35.938]  So Rob Dew is here to break this down.
[01:55:35.958 --> 01:55:36.819]  I've got a whole folder.
[01:55:37.788 --> 01:55:41.112]  Dealing with it like, oh my gosh, everybody's allergic to meat now, to beef.
[01:55:41.533 --> 01:55:42.394]  It's because of the tick.
[01:55:42.554 --> 01:55:43.175]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:43.215 --> 01:55:45.918]  People in Canada can't eat beef now, and the tick isn't there.
[01:55:46.279 --> 01:55:48.181]  People in Germany can't eat it, the tick's not there.
[01:55:48.421 --> 01:55:50.163]  People in Australia can't eat it, the tick's not there.
[01:55:50.464 --> 01:55:53.668]  The tick is the cover, like, oh, Brody James had a heart attack!
[01:55:54.355 --> 01:55:57.416]  Cause uh, cause he took, cause he got COVID!
[01:55:57.516 --> 01:55:59.056]  No, it's the shot.
[01:55:59.557 --> 01:56:02.678]  So you got a bunch of text messages, a bunch of tweets, a bunch of emails.
[01:56:03.138 --> 01:56:04.778]  Rob Dew on top of this.
[01:56:04.818 --> 01:56:11.300]  First breakdown, the details of it, what the syndrome is, and then get into the, just the huge response we've gotten.
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:15.582]  We're going to open the phones up tomorrow for folks to say, hey, maybe you took the shot and it's great.
[01:56:16.302 --> 01:56:17.622]  But I've got a sneaking suspicion.
[01:56:17.642 --> 01:56:23.364]  We're going to open the phones up, it's going to be nothing but callers that can't eat beef now because they took the shot.
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:29.063]  Well, Alpha-Gal Syndrome, thanks Alex, is from the Mayo Clinic, it's a type of food allergy.
[01:56:29.503 --> 01:56:36.707]  And so, this Alpha-Gal is a protein, and they're putting it in, you can look this up, this is a Mayo Clinic document, talks about Alpha-Gal.
[01:56:37.268 --> 01:56:41.290]  Then we showed yesterday, a CDC document, products that may contain Alpha-Gal.
[01:56:42.003 --> 01:56:43.243]  Which you guys have that one.
[01:56:43.724 --> 01:56:46.225]  You know what, I'll show it to this little camera over here so people can see it.
[01:56:46.345 --> 01:56:48.325]  They believe it's a CDC document right there.
[01:56:48.345 --> 01:56:49.146]  We can pull it up too.
[01:56:49.326 --> 01:56:49.806]  Right there.
[01:56:50.486 --> 01:56:58.429]  And if you go to the end of this, it has a link to another CDC PDF, but it tells you non-food products that may contain alpha-gal.
[01:56:58.469 --> 01:57:02.770]  You have gelatin, glycerin, magnesium stearate, and bovine extract.
[01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:07.312]  Bovine extract is basically when they liquefy a baby cow and use that as the medium.
[01:57:07.352 --> 01:57:09.853]  And by the way, you sent this to the network, we're going to skip this break.
[01:57:10.613 --> 01:57:12.435]  It's in the video we posted yesterday.
[01:57:12.455 --> 01:57:13.076]  In the video, yes.
[01:57:13.556 --> 01:57:14.938]  So we'll put it all on screen.
[01:57:14.958 --> 01:57:15.358]  Keep going.
[01:57:15.458 --> 01:57:15.759]  All that.
[01:57:16.239 --> 01:57:32.956]  And so when I cross-referenced, and there's a link that takes you to a list of vaccines, and I just cross-referenced those items in the vaccines and just did a search, and you can see there's about 15 different vaccines that contain these products in one form or another.
[01:57:34.701 --> 01:57:36.900]   This is what-- - That they admit caused the allergy.
[01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:38.240]  That will cause the allergy.
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:42.100]   And there's studies, you could just do studies, look up alpha-gal, and here's the interesting thing.
[01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:46.780]   They sometimes use the alpha symbol, which it looks like an A, but it's got a weird side on it,
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:49.581]  but it's A-gal, and it's the same thing.
[01:57:49.581 --> 01:57:52.180]  So some people say alpha-gal, some people say A-gal.
[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:55.140]  So when you're using your searches, notice that.
[01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:59.940]   Sometimes you won't find, you have to almost copy the A-gal and put it into a search engine,
[01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:02.100]  then you'll find even more things about it.
[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:04.539]  And it's amazing stuff, looking at all this.
[01:58:04.539 --> 01:58:06.980]  Basically, this protein's in a lot of vaccines.
[01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:10.180]  And you look at the comments we got on Twitter.
[01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:12.819]   I developed a beef allergy shortly after my four-year-old shots.
[01:58:12.819 --> 01:58:15.560]   I can't eat meat, had my first steak two years ago, made me sick.
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:17.541]  Yeah, so somebody, great patriots.
[01:58:17.679 --> 01:58:20.141]  Yeah, posted the full 15-minute report.
[01:58:20.201 --> 01:58:20.722]  Oh, exactly.
[01:58:20.842 --> 01:58:24.085]  Got thousands of comments, like half of them, I can't eat meat anymore.
[01:58:24.325 --> 01:58:26.968]  I've been hypersensitive since my last pneumonia vaccine.
[01:58:27.008 --> 01:58:33.334]  So it's in a lot of the vaccines that people are taking, and then your immune system's getting hit after you take the COVID shot.
[01:58:33.734 --> 01:58:34.955]  So it could be activating it.
[01:58:35.396 --> 01:58:39.439]  I don't believe them when they say it's not in there, because you can search, it's like, oh, alpha-gal.
[01:58:39.459 --> 01:58:41.061]  There's studies saying it's triggering it.
[01:58:41.121 --> 01:58:52.410]  Well, they also said there was no green monkey virus or green monkey cells in the COVID vaccine, yet the guy who was doing the Human Genome Project, one of the people who worked on it, found it in the vials, clean vials of the vaccine.
[01:58:52.430 --> 01:58:56.253]  He discovered it himself, the DNA and RNA fragments of the green monkey virus.
[01:58:56.293 --> 01:58:57.093]  And Jenny Megibus exposed it.
[01:58:57.193 --> 01:58:57.654]  Exactly.
[01:58:57.774 --> 01:58:58.194]  Dr. Megibus.
[01:58:59.695 --> 01:59:06.417]  You can't believe anything they say, and they'll have an army of fact checkers when you search for things saying, oh no, it doesn't exist, it's fine, just keep doing it.
[01:59:06.697 --> 01:59:17.920]  As you see people drop dead around you, as you read the comments of people having food allergies after taking these vaccines, and then as you take the COVID shot, your immune system gets even more suppressed, and boom, it allows this gene to go forward.
[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:22.123]  I know several people got the COVID-19 shot that can now not eat beef.
[01:59:22.183 --> 01:59:23.084]  Interesting connection.
[01:59:23.504 --> 01:59:23.765]  Weird.
[01:59:23.805 --> 01:59:25.106]  I know two people who took the jab.
[01:59:25.146 --> 01:59:25.786]  This happened to them.
[01:59:25.866 --> 01:59:27.268]  Every time they eat meat, it makes them sick.
[01:59:27.308 --> 01:59:29.750]  You can go read the comments for yourself in that tweet.
[01:59:29.810 --> 01:59:30.550]  It's amazing.
[01:59:31.011 --> 01:59:35.875]  And I would trust these people more than I trust the CDC at this point because they've been caught lying over and over again.
[01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:38.301]  And we know the peanut allergy.
[01:59:38.341 --> 01:59:39.662]  They grew vaccines on peanuts.
[01:59:39.742 --> 01:59:40.663]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:59:40.803 --> 01:59:42.584]  Yeah, and that's the thing.
[01:59:42.784 --> 01:59:50.209]  They put these things in the vaccine to stimulate a response to your immune system, but then your immune system goes, oh, anytime we see that, we're going to attack it.
[01:59:50.429 --> 01:59:55.372]  Well, something like when the UN got caught adding a female hormone that's in the second trimester to tetanus to sterilize women.
[01:59:55.532 --> 01:59:59.275]  Yeah, that article is in the report we did there, too.
[01:59:59.515 --> 02:00:00.696]  And that's kind of a blast from the past.
[02:00:00.716 --> 02:00:03.017]  That was from the 90s and early 2000s.
[02:00:03.078 --> 02:00:05.479]  Yeah, let's put yesterday's report we followed up on screen.
[02:00:05.499 --> 02:00:06.240]  What was the exact headline?
[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:06.540]  I forget.
[02:00:08.121 --> 02:00:11.945]  Uh, COVID vaccines contain cow protein that triggers toxic meat allergies.
[02:00:12.465 --> 02:00:15.508]  And we talk about the weaponization of the food supply, because that's what's going on.
[02:00:15.889 --> 02:00:19.372]  They want you allergic to the basic things that are good for you.
[02:00:19.472 --> 02:00:20.493]  Meat is good for you.
[02:00:20.673 --> 02:00:21.514]  Eggs are good for you.
[02:00:21.554 --> 02:00:23.215]  That's some of the best food you could be eating.
[02:00:23.476 --> 02:00:24.296]  Butter's good for you.
[02:00:24.357 --> 02:00:26.458]  Regular, pure butter, not that... Milds your brain.
[02:00:26.539 --> 02:00:26.779]  Yeah.
[02:00:26.979 --> 02:00:27.720]  Longs don't burn it.
[02:00:29.121 --> 02:00:35.846]  Your body and your brain run on these fats and oils that are, not the seed oils, the good oils that come from animals.
[02:00:36.526 --> 02:00:38.488]  And so, they don't want you eating that anymore.
[02:00:38.528 --> 02:00:40.009]  They want you on this lab-grown stuff.
[02:00:40.029 --> 02:00:42.171]  They'll probably say, oh, the new lab-grown meat doesn't have alpha.
[02:00:42.191 --> 02:00:43.712]  That's why they're rolling out the lab meat.
[02:00:43.752 --> 02:00:45.433]  Yes, which is grown on cancer tumors.
[02:00:45.453 --> 02:00:47.775]  I mean, it's disgusting what they want to do to our bodies.
[02:00:47.895 --> 02:00:48.275]  That's right.
[02:00:48.415 --> 02:00:55.581]  They grow, Bill Gates on record on his own website, they grow the lab-grown meat from immortal cell-line cancer tumors.
[02:00:56.261 --> 02:00:57.021]  Because it grows well.
[02:00:57.061 --> 02:00:57.902]  That's the food, yeah.
[02:00:57.982 --> 02:01:00.183]  You're eating cancer tumors, folks.
[02:01:00.503 --> 02:01:01.383]  You can't make this up.
[02:01:02.183 --> 02:01:03.224]  It's totally disgusting.
[02:01:03.564 --> 02:01:05.245]  And so that's why you have to do your own research.
[02:01:05.265 --> 02:01:06.485]  There's a lot of studies out there.
[02:01:06.825 --> 02:01:09.846]  They're talking about different blood types with the Alpha-Gal.
[02:01:09.886 --> 02:01:12.968]  Some people will show the Alpha-Gal response after COVID.
[02:01:13.008 --> 02:01:13.628]  Some people won't.
[02:01:13.668 --> 02:01:24.012]  They did a study of employees at, I don't know if it was CDC, but it was a prevalence of Alpha-Gal in mammalian meat in COVID-19 vaccine employee cohort.
[02:01:24.672 --> 02:01:31.696]  So they were tracking this in some people and the ones who had COVID-19 showed a higher incidence of this alpha-gal in their system.
[02:01:32.257 --> 02:01:34.398]  So I'm not saying it's in there.
[02:01:34.438 --> 02:01:39.661]  I haven't found these smoking guns saying this alpha-gal is in there, but I do not trust these guys one bit.
[02:01:39.681 --> 02:01:41.242]  But that's the COVID shot that triggers it.
[02:01:41.322 --> 02:01:42.423]  It is in a bunch of the vaccines.
[02:01:42.443 --> 02:01:43.303]  It's in a bunch of the vaccines.
[02:01:43.323 --> 02:01:44.284]  List the vaccines it's in.
[02:01:44.884 --> 02:01:46.125]  Well, I'll pull that out in one second.
[02:01:46.145 --> 02:01:49.729]  Let me because I have to go to that's a small writing here, but but here it is.
[02:01:49.909 --> 02:01:50.149]  Okay.
[02:01:50.389 --> 02:01:53.833]  So yeah, let me I'll just list the ones that have these items in there.
[02:01:53.893 --> 02:02:03.723]   So the adenovirus vaccine, the Tice vaccine, the DTAP, two different, three different types of TDAPs, hepatitis A, Let's go to the next page.
[02:02:04.063 --> 02:02:11.654]  Influenza, the flu mist, IPV, the Japanese encephalitis, MMR, the MMR quadvalent.
[02:02:11.974 --> 02:02:18.404]  So they're growing it on beef cells that are dead babies, which we think is good, but it's actually causing a beef allergy.
[02:02:18.804 --> 02:02:19.345]  Exactly.
[02:02:19.545 --> 02:02:27.111]  And then it may not be enough in your system, or you were able to work through it, but then when you take that COVID shot, that thing is crushing your immune system.
[02:02:27.131 --> 02:02:28.132]  And that's what it's designed to do.
[02:02:28.192 --> 02:02:29.533]  It's designed to crush your immune system.
[02:02:29.553 --> 02:02:30.714]  And it's a spike protein too.
[02:02:30.974 --> 02:02:31.454]  Exactly.
[02:02:31.714 --> 02:02:32.835]  And all these things are proteins.
[02:02:32.875 --> 02:02:39.160]  I think they're getting down to the science of, if we can manipulate proteins, it's hard to pinpoint how these things work.
[02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:39.841]  Because it's kind of hard.
[02:02:40.561 --> 02:02:41.402]  This is new science.
[02:02:41.422 --> 02:02:43.684]  This is new within the last, you know, 20-30 years.
[02:02:44.004 --> 02:02:50.829]  But they've been working on mRNA vaccines for about 20 years now, and they've kind of perfected it in the term of a bioweapon.
[02:02:50.849 --> 02:02:52.971]  And they can never roll them out because they always kill people.
[02:02:53.171 --> 02:02:53.631]  Exactly.
[02:02:53.911 --> 02:02:57.414]  But then once COVID happened, they're like, oh, now we have the test case.
[02:02:57.434 --> 02:03:00.857]  We're going to do a worldwide test and see if we put this much in it.
[02:03:00.877 --> 02:03:02.878]  That's why you saw the different batches of vials.
[02:03:02.898 --> 02:03:06.741]  You had some that were saline, some that were like half strength, and some that were full strength that were killing people.
[02:03:06.781 --> 02:03:09.944]  So the bottom line is they told us they're coming out of the food supply.
[02:03:09.964 --> 02:03:11.526]   They told us we They won't eat beef and they're doing it.
[02:03:11.626 --> 02:03:12.147]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:03:12.528 --> 02:03:12.849]  That's it.
[02:03:12.889 --> 02:03:15.393]  They're going to make us unable to eat beef.
[02:03:15.434 --> 02:03:16.976]  That's how they're going to stop us from eating beef.
[02:03:17.117 --> 02:03:18.018]  And here's the good news.
[02:03:19.321 --> 02:03:26.284]  Everybody freaked out about some beef producers said we're going to inject mRNA in our cows for COVID, as if COVID was killing cows and dogs and cats.
[02:03:26.585 --> 02:03:27.485]  There was a backlash.
[02:03:27.585 --> 02:03:30.326]  The Beef Association said, OK, we won't.
[02:03:30.927 --> 02:03:31.527]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:03:31.547 --> 02:03:34.628]  They give us a shot that makes us allergic so we can't eat it anyways.
[02:03:34.788 --> 02:03:35.229]  Exactly.
[02:03:35.409 --> 02:03:36.729]  They're not targeting the cows, folks.
[02:03:36.749 --> 02:03:37.610]  They're targeting us.
[02:03:38.050 --> 02:03:39.211]  This is the big enchilada.
[02:03:39.291 --> 02:03:40.151]  This is the big story.
[02:03:40.351 --> 02:03:42.092]  Because there's two million people, according to the U.N.
[02:03:42.132 --> 02:03:45.093]  report, 2.1 million, that make their living off cows.
[02:03:45.153 --> 02:03:59.482]   I can tell you, these Texas We got 2,000 acres left, we got Mexican land grants, Spanish land grants before Santa Ana, and we don't really make money on the cows, but it pays the property tax, it pays for the tractors, and you know, people can basically live on that.
[02:03:59.522 --> 02:04:02.941]   You don't make a lot of money, but You take cows away, it's over.
[02:04:03.362 --> 02:04:04.262]  And you're having good steaks.
[02:04:04.943 --> 02:04:06.485]  So that's living great, isn't it?
[02:04:07.025 --> 02:04:11.970]  Well, Genesis starts after God sets up the planet and let there be light and water and all that.
[02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:16.395]  He says, and now I create cows and the grass as your greatest gift.
[02:04:16.435 --> 02:04:23.777]   I mean, it literally says the cows, that's pull up, I forget the exact quote, but pull up Genesis quotes about cows and grass.
[02:04:23.777 --> 02:04:24.777]  And a lot of that grass...
[02:04:24.777 --> 02:04:25.777]  I mean, it's like over and over again.
[02:04:25.777 --> 02:04:28.056]   I give you cows, I give you grass, I give you cows, I give you grass.
[02:04:28.056 --> 02:04:29.056]  Exactly.
[02:04:29.056 --> 02:04:30.056]  And a lot of that grass...
[02:04:30.056 --> 02:04:31.056]  It's like incredible.
[02:04:31.056 --> 02:04:32.056]  You put cows out there, they eat, you get this great meat.
[02:04:32.056 --> 02:04:33.056]  I mean, it's like, it's energy.
[02:04:33.056 --> 02:04:37.336]   It's like they're cutting off our pipelines, cutting off our cars, cutting off our gas.
[02:04:37.336 --> 02:04:38.737]  They're cutting off our food.
[02:04:38.737 --> 02:04:39.737]  Yeah.
[02:04:40.421 --> 02:04:46.427]  They don't want you to have any choice but to go to this lab-grown meat in a 15-minute city with a, you know, a microchip in your hand.
[02:04:46.447 --> 02:04:48.269]  Remember 30 years ago they said beef's horrible.
[02:04:48.369 --> 02:04:50.911]  All the studies show now it's the perfect food for people.
[02:04:50.991 --> 02:04:52.773]  Yeah, that's what we used to eat.
[02:04:52.833 --> 02:04:53.793]  We used to hunt bison.
[02:04:53.814 --> 02:04:54.694]  We used to hunt mammoth.
[02:04:54.754 --> 02:04:55.595]  We used to eat meat.
[02:04:55.655 --> 02:04:56.276]  That's what we did.
[02:04:56.856 --> 02:04:58.797]  And if we didn't eat it, then we started growing food.
[02:04:59.317 --> 02:05:03.858]  And, you know, there's nothing wrong with vegetables, but meat has got the fats in it that your brain needs.
[02:05:03.878 --> 02:05:07.539]  Well, everybody knows it was always the meat-eaters who conquered the agrarians.
[02:05:07.559 --> 02:05:07.799]  Yeah.
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:12.301]  Oh, there's an amazing picture of, I think it's these Mongolian dudes, and they look giant.
[02:05:12.321 --> 02:05:15.802]  And there's these little Europeans standing in front of them that probably eat nothing but cheese and bread.
[02:05:16.202 --> 02:05:17.202]  And you can see the difference.
[02:05:17.222 --> 02:05:19.563]  These other guys look like they'd wipe them off the map, no problem.
[02:05:19.583 --> 02:05:24.104]  And that's why Genghis Khan conquered everybody, because his guys were eating meat and drinking goat milk.
[02:05:24.124 --> 02:05:25.325]  Look, it's a lie, folks.
[02:05:26.365 --> 02:05:28.067]  And all these vegans are dying now?
[02:05:28.287 --> 02:05:28.487]  Yeah.
[02:05:29.228 --> 02:05:29.949]  Yeah, it's terrible.
[02:05:30.309 --> 02:05:31.350]  And there is factory farming.
[02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:32.091]  There are excesses.
[02:05:32.131 --> 02:05:33.252]  We're not defending all that.
[02:05:33.572 --> 02:05:36.014]  The point is getting rid of it for factory grown meat?
[02:05:36.074 --> 02:05:36.675]  It's even worse.
[02:05:36.995 --> 02:05:37.255]  It is.
[02:05:37.856 --> 02:05:39.558]  And that's where it comes from.
[02:05:39.738 --> 02:05:42.560]  You can't trust anything these people say at the bottom line.
[02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:44.282]  They tell you there's nothing in these vaccines.
[02:05:44.302 --> 02:05:45.323]  There's lots of stuff in these.
[02:05:45.343 --> 02:05:48.286]  Well, they're saying a tick is causing people not to be able to eat beef.
[02:05:48.906 --> 02:05:50.326]  In places the tick doesn't exist.
[02:05:50.386 --> 02:05:53.747]  And I wouldn't be surprised if the tick had been engineered just like the Lyme disease.
[02:05:53.767 --> 02:05:55.047]  Well, Lyme disease did come.
[02:05:55.067 --> 02:05:58.068]  The Nazis after World War II were brought to Plum Island off New York.
[02:05:58.608 --> 02:05:59.448]  It's declassified.
[02:05:59.488 --> 02:06:02.069]  They created Lyme disease that is tick-delivered syphilis.
[02:06:02.169 --> 02:06:08.450]  So it wouldn't surprise me that they engineer a tick and put it out in the wild to just go around and eat people and then go, oh, we can blame it on this tick.
[02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:11.471]  Because maybe there is some instances of this tick giving people a meat allergy.
[02:06:11.871 --> 02:06:13.812]  But there's not enough to what's going on now.
[02:06:13.832 --> 02:06:15.212]  Well, it's happening in Japan.
[02:06:15.652 --> 02:06:16.553]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:06:16.573 --> 02:06:18.173]  It's happening in Germany.
[02:06:18.674 --> 02:06:19.734]  The damn tick isn't there.
[02:06:19.914 --> 02:06:20.114]  Yeah.
[02:06:20.635 --> 02:06:21.895]  So we know they've done it.
[02:06:22.556 --> 02:06:34.022]  If we get out ahead of it and get the beef community to say, hey, it's the shots, because notice now they're backing off Glyphosate on wheat, which is mature, about to be harvested wheat.
[02:06:34.122 --> 02:06:39.044]  You don't spray it to keep weeds going up because that dissipates and runs off, gets in the water table and you drink it and get cancer.
[02:06:39.064 --> 02:06:39.564]  It's still bad.
[02:06:39.845 --> 02:06:42.286]  But nothing compared to them in the last 20 years spraying the wheat.
[02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:46.063]  And then you just eat this and go, oh my God, I can't eat gluten all of a sudden.
[02:06:46.203 --> 02:06:46.343]  Right.
[02:06:46.363 --> 02:06:48.885]  You're not gluten intolerant, you're Roundup intolerant.
[02:06:48.965 --> 02:06:49.186]  Yeah.
[02:06:49.366 --> 02:06:50.267]  Nobody wants Roundup.
[02:06:50.467 --> 02:06:51.588]  Nobody needs Alpha-Gal.
[02:06:51.968 --> 02:06:53.470]  These things are not good for you.
[02:06:53.810 --> 02:06:54.891]  So that's why they're using them.
[02:06:56.152 --> 02:06:56.793]  What's it called?
[02:06:56.913 --> 02:06:57.493]  Alpha-Gal?
[02:06:57.593 --> 02:06:58.154]  Alpha-Gal.
[02:06:58.174 --> 02:06:59.275]  Explain what Alpha-Gal is.
[02:06:59.535 --> 02:07:06.401]  Alpha-Gal is a protein that, when you eat it, you become allergic to meat, or when it's in your body, you become allergic to meat.
[02:07:06.502 --> 02:07:08.363]  And it's an old, it's a bunch of shots.
[02:07:08.403 --> 02:07:08.944]  Not just cow.
[02:07:09.204 --> 02:07:11.125]  Yeah, and they blame it on the tit.
[02:07:11.385 --> 02:07:11.605]  Right.
[02:07:12.145 --> 02:07:13.225]  Which, give me a break, Bugs.
[02:07:13.905 --> 02:07:14.365]  It's a fraud.
[02:07:14.405 --> 02:07:15.206]  So it's a big deal.
[02:07:15.766 --> 02:07:18.526]  And once they get beef, it'll be fish, it'll be everything.
[02:07:18.987 --> 02:07:21.107]  It'll be everything, and then what will you have?
[02:07:21.147 --> 02:07:25.288]  We'll have, you know, bugs, which also... Titan's extremely toxic.
[02:07:25.308 --> 02:07:26.008]  Top of that, yeah.
[02:07:26.349 --> 02:07:28.569]  So you got bugs, and you're gonna have lab-grown tumor meat.
[02:07:28.989 --> 02:07:30.410]  And that's gonna be your meat.
[02:07:30.430 --> 02:07:31.450]  From immortal cell lines.
[02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:34.151]  And folks, Google immortal cell lines, you wanna have a nightmare.
[02:07:35.051 --> 02:07:35.511]  Exactly.
[02:07:36.020 --> 02:07:37.020]  It's not really meat.
[02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:38.020]  It's not diabolical.
[02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:42.020]   Like throw a tumor in a vat, it just grows until they have a 500 pound tumor.
[02:07:42.020 --> 02:07:43.020]  Yeah.
[02:07:43.020 --> 02:07:44.859]  And then they cut it up and put it into a fake steak.
[02:07:44.859 --> 02:07:49.140]   In fact, show that video folks of them taking the tumor meat, cancer meat, and literally
[02:07:49.140 --> 02:07:50.699]  creating a fake steak for you.
[02:07:50.699 --> 02:07:52.100]  That's how sick Bill Gates is.
[02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:53.940]  And if you accept him, he wins.
[02:07:53.940 --> 02:07:56.739]   In closing, I thought that was a pretty amazing press conference.
[02:07:56.869 --> 02:07:59.130]  Jonescrowder.com, Fremont.
[02:07:59.150 --> 02:07:59.951]  People sign up right now.
[02:07:59.971 --> 02:08:00.931]  Starting this new Friday show.
[02:08:00.951 --> 02:08:02.332]  We're going to launch a bunch of other stuff.
[02:08:02.653 --> 02:08:06.615]  If this is successful, which it should be, reporters, crew, whole thing out of this.
[02:08:07.356 --> 02:08:08.377]  We'll keep InfoWars going.
[02:08:08.417 --> 02:08:08.957]  Great guys.
[02:08:09.037 --> 02:08:09.938]  We'll merge them together.
[02:08:11.417 --> 02:08:12.058]  A lot of new blood.
[02:08:12.278 --> 02:08:17.842]  This is called diversifying your portfolio, you know, because if you are one target, then you're only one target that the people can take out.
[02:08:17.882 --> 02:08:20.805]  If you've got a lot of targets spread out, it's harder for them to take you out.
[02:08:20.825 --> 02:08:22.306]  And I've got some bad news for our enemies.
[02:08:22.386 --> 02:08:26.009]  I mean, I've got all the other groups offering deals, but Crowder's the one I'm doing.
[02:08:27.819 --> 02:08:32.743]  Well, and Rumble's shown that they're not going to censor people.
[02:08:34.044 --> 02:08:41.589]  I haven't seen anything yet where Rumble's pulling people's videos and cancelling channels unless it's something serious where they're doxing people.
[02:08:41.609 --> 02:08:42.630]  Well, it's classic.
[02:08:43.010 --> 02:08:46.633]  It's hacking, calls for murder, drug dealing, pedophilia, it's all banned.
[02:08:46.653 --> 02:08:47.413]  That's normal law.
[02:08:47.774 --> 02:08:48.995]  That's the web six, seven years ago.
[02:08:49.035 --> 02:08:50.215]  It's back to normal free internet.
[02:08:50.256 --> 02:08:50.636]  Exactly.
[02:08:51.096 --> 02:08:54.720]  So go to jonescrowder.com to get the free month, the best deal.
[02:08:55.001 --> 02:08:59.806]  You get Steven Crowder shows, all the other shows they've got, jonescrowder.com and that's going to support us.
[02:08:59.867 --> 02:09:00.647]  Take action now.
[02:09:00.708 --> 02:09:01.368]  You want us to fight?
[02:09:01.809 --> 02:09:02.950]  It's up to you to take action.
[02:09:04.432 --> 02:09:07.816]  Rob, we're going to air big excerpts of the press conference that happened at 9 a.m.
[02:09:07.836 --> 02:09:08.156]  this morning.
[02:09:08.176 --> 02:09:09.017]  We only aired part of it earlier.
[02:09:09.037 --> 02:09:15.537]   We're going to air more of it coming up and then We have a great guest host that is taking over in the fourth hour.
[02:09:15.557 --> 02:09:19.719]  Maria Z. Maria Z. And then we've got Owen Troyer, 3 p.m.
[02:09:20.119 --> 02:09:20.459]  Central.
[02:09:20.479 --> 02:09:21.619]  And I'm telling you, this is all going to go great.
[02:09:21.959 --> 02:09:25.181]  People like Owen and other shows will produce out of our operation and be on here.
[02:09:25.808 --> 02:09:34.052]  So that's really what this is all about, teaming up with a great production crew, great people that aren't scared, the great folks at Rumble, because Rumble reached out and wanted to do a deal too, but they didn't have the production.
[02:09:34.592 --> 02:09:36.193]  So it's perfect with the crowd and we're very excited.
[02:09:36.553 --> 02:09:55.122]  Yeah, I am too, and meeting the crew and hanging out with them last night, you know, because I'm coming here a lot with you, but just meeting the crew and seeing how engaged they are and how smart they are, it's like a bunch of other info warriors out there doing more stuff to really just get the word out, because that's, at the end of the day, that's the most important thing, informing people, because we can't trust the mainstream media and we can't trust the government.
[02:09:55.342 --> 02:09:55.802]  Absolutely.
[02:09:55.822 --> 02:09:58.344]  So the big press conference for the next 30 minutes is coming up.
[02:09:58.384 --> 02:09:59.085]  Spread the word.
[02:09:59.225 --> 02:10:00.466]  You're the wave this dog hunts.

[02:11:49.253 --> 02:11:50.594]  Great job, Steven Crowder and crew.
[02:11:50.894 --> 02:11:51.954]  Coming up, the press conference.
[02:11:51.774 --> 02:11:52.774]  Stay with us.
[02:11:52.774 --> 02:11:53.774]  [MUSIC]
[02:11:53.774 --> 02:12:07.293]   Have you been compromising day in and day out when no compromise is necessary?
[02:12:07.293 --> 02:12:09.153]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:12.141]  And I'll go one further.
[02:12:12.621 --> 02:12:17.823]  Where no compromise should ever be expected from you.
[02:12:18.864 --> 02:12:21.104]  It is time to match intensity.
[02:12:21.104 --> 02:12:32.223]   Every single one of you watching or listening right now needs to flip a switch in your head
[02:12:32.223 --> 02:12:41.903]   where you will make those sons of bitches embarrassed that they ever even thought of asking that compliment.
[02:12:42.102 --> 02:12:45.685]  Imagine the founding fathers looking down and going, what the fuck are you people doing?
[02:12:45.705 --> 02:12:51.631]  You're talking about the same people that rail against misinformation, who platform Adam Schiff.
[02:12:51.671 --> 02:12:54.494]  This case needs to be blown up and the ATF needs to be held accountable.
[02:12:54.673 --> 02:12:58.033]  Why can't we not condemn evil behavior?
[02:12:58.033 --> 02:13:08.033]  [MUSIC]
[02:13:21.134 --> 02:13:24.833]  Hello Mug Club and all you strange animals out there.
[02:13:24.833 --> 02:13:29.373]  [APPLAUSE]
[02:13:29.133 --> 02:13:34.997]  We've been hard at work with our friends at Rumble to bring you the first network controlled by creators.
[02:13:35.217 --> 02:13:40.061]  And two of the biggest giants in this industry are joining forces under the same umbrella.
[02:13:40.521 --> 02:13:41.461]  No more censorship.
[02:13:41.722 --> 02:13:43.203]  No more big tech dependents.
[02:13:43.463 --> 02:13:44.964]  No more one-sided contracts.
[02:13:45.464 --> 02:13:49.585]  The time for an open, honest, and transparent network has arrived.
[02:13:50.085 --> 02:13:53.286]  The time for a network controlled by the creators has arrived.
[02:13:53.306 --> 02:13:58.928]  The time for a network that allows creators to focus on their audience has arrived.
[02:13:59.268 --> 02:14:05.070]  If you're signing up for Mug Club today, use promo code replatforming for a free Fight Like Hell t-shirt.
[02:14:05.450 --> 02:14:06.551]  Join us in that fight.
[02:14:07.231 --> 02:14:08.471]  We didn't seek this out, guys.
[02:14:08.511 --> 02:14:11.472]  We didn't look for the extra work of trying to start a network.
[02:14:12.392 --> 02:14:13.413]  We wanted to do a show!
[02:14:14.173 --> 02:14:15.614]  We wanted to make people laugh.
[02:14:16.015 --> 02:14:19.938]  We wanted to educate and entertain them and try to help save our country.
[02:14:20.438 --> 02:14:22.780]  But so many of you weren't being served.
[02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:32.327]  It was all about scam advertising, dishonest tactics, censorship, playing ball with people that don't share your values, and we couldn't stand idly by while that happened.
[02:14:32.928 --> 02:14:35.690]  They want to cancel every one of you and every one of us.
[02:14:36.351 --> 02:14:40.894]  But because of you, because of Mug Club, they can't touch us.
[02:14:41.535 --> 02:14:43.016]  Let the replatforming begin.
[02:14:45.862 --> 02:14:54.907]  Democrats are afraid of this guy, the liberal media can't stand him, and Big Tech wants to cancel him, but you have made him uncancellable!
[02:14:55.007 --> 02:15:01.007]  Welcome the strange animal himself, Steven Crowder!
[02:15:01.007 --> 02:15:08.007]   You're a strange animal, that's what I know I know, I know
[02:15:08.007 --> 02:15:14.007]   You're a strange animal, I'm the father of all That's what I'm talking about, whoo!
[02:15:14.007 --> 02:15:24.007]   I'm the mess, I'm the mess, I'm the mess Now, come in with me!
[02:15:24.007 --> 02:15:30.007]  My, my, how!
[02:15:30.007 --> 02:15:39.318]   Alright, welcome to the replatforming conference We have some members of the press and friends here.
[02:15:39.799 --> 02:15:40.560]  Thanks for coming out.
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:42.583]  We'll be taking some questions from them later.
[02:15:43.404 --> 02:15:45.948]  Boy, that was a self-important intro, but thank you guys for putting it together.
[02:15:46.028 --> 02:15:48.491]  I never feel comfortable with that.
[02:15:48.692 --> 02:15:49.473]  I wish I were a rapper.
[02:15:51.590 --> 02:16:00.335]  So, uh, look, just a few minutes we'll be making some major announcements regarding the future of Mug Club, and it's widening to a full-fledged network powered by Rumble.
[02:16:00.355 --> 02:16:09.500]  And what I mean by that is Mug Club, if you go to ladderwithcreditor.com slash mug club now, one portal, and it's a network to many different creators, some of whom we'll announce today and more to come.
[02:16:10.041 --> 02:16:18.325]  So we have announcements regarding new shows, new types of content, new ways to impact the country, this increasingly silly place, and the tyrannical platforms of big tech.
[02:16:19.487 --> 02:16:20.850]  First, let me get into this a little bit.
[02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:23.957]  Replatforming is the title here for a reason.
[02:16:25.099 --> 02:16:40.326]   And because of all these announcements and the people from whom you're about to hear, Replatforming is a story about what's been lost, what's been risked, really, what's been taken from people, and what, starting today, we will all actively begin to regain.
[02:16:40.566 --> 02:16:52.417]  And before that, Mug Club's been around for such a long time that it kind of occurred to me, for some of the folks new here, I haven't done a great job in explaining to you what Mug Club is, what Phase 1, at least, has been up until now, before we get to the new announcements.
[02:16:52.797 --> 02:16:54.039]  It's a simple concept, Mug Club.
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:56.561]  We bleed so you don't have to.
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:17:04.886]  We've had people come up and say, hey, you know, I wish I could say some of these things that, you know, you guys can say on there, but I'll get fired from my job.
[02:17:05.487 --> 02:17:06.567]  I don't want you to get fired from your job.
[02:17:07.348 --> 02:17:13.874]  But when you join up, when you give us your dollar, we have to be able to say what it is that you can't say.
[02:17:14.154 --> 02:17:15.455]  Otherwise, we're stealing from you.
[02:17:16.055 --> 02:17:22.381]  If we play ball with big tech, if we decide to take your dollar, but then say, we've got to make tens of millions of dollars off YouTube ad revenue, we're screwing you.
[02:17:23.467 --> 02:17:28.169]  So Mug Club is exactly what has allowed us, all of us, to remain completely independent since 2016.
[02:17:29.730 --> 02:17:31.790]  Before that, online revenue was generated by ads, okay?
[02:17:31.810 --> 02:17:32.731]  Some inside baseball here.
[02:17:33.491 --> 02:17:36.532]  I knew, back then, in order to maintain that, I would have to make compromises.
[02:17:36.672 --> 02:17:47.577]  YouTube, Facebook, they kept telling us what kind of content we were permitted to post, what kind of creators they would be happy to work with, and exactly what kind of people, what kind of conservatives, would be put in the corner.
[02:17:48.712 --> 02:17:56.097]  I couldn't stomach it then, I can't stomach it now, and no one here can, and because of Mug Club, because of you, we don't have to.
[02:17:56.958 --> 02:17:57.518]  Give you some history.
[02:17:57.538 --> 02:18:05.124]  Because of Mug Club, when NBCUniversal, Vox, CNN tried to deplatform all of us, meaning us and you, we survived the Vox Apocalypse.
[02:18:05.884 --> 02:18:08.666]  YouTube, Google said, hey, you're not going to make another dime off ads.
[02:18:09.026 --> 02:18:11.608]  And because of you, Mug Club, we said, fine.
[02:18:11.788 --> 02:18:15.551]  Viewers like you, you know how PBS says that, but really they mean another grant, more money, please?
[02:18:17.256 --> 02:18:24.258]  Because of Mug Club, with zero ad revenue, we were able to host the single most viewed, individually viewed I should say, election stream of 2020.
[02:18:24.978 --> 02:18:41.843]  And because of Mug Club not being beholden to Big Tech's advertising or their guidelines, we were able to cover the voting dumps as they happened, the boarded up polling stations as they happened, the corrupt early calling of states as they happened, and the gaslighting of you from the media and Big Tech for believing your lying eyes and lying ears.
[02:18:42.143 --> 02:18:43.363]  Completely demonetized.
[02:18:44.163 --> 02:18:44.884]  We can keep fighting.
[02:18:45.764 --> 02:18:46.364]  Because of Mug Club.
[02:18:47.168 --> 02:18:52.931]  And when we were banned, by the way, from covering the midterm elections, 2024 kicked off YouTube just a week before happenstance.
[02:18:53.612 --> 02:18:54.372]  YouTube and Google.
[02:18:55.193 --> 02:19:04.598]  Because of Mug Club, we broadcast the single largest individual election livestream to occur on any other platform outside of YouTube, doing it through Rumble and the history of the internet.
[02:19:04.638 --> 02:19:05.599]  Completely demonetized.
[02:19:06.379 --> 02:19:09.121]  We can keep fighting and growing because of Mug Club.
[02:19:09.873 --> 02:19:27.720]  Because of Mug Club, when the entire world went crazy and locked down due to the China virus, and you were going stir-crazy with nowhere to go, and even conservative hosts were suspending their broadcasting or doing it from their basement with a webcam, we were able to be right here with you and instead, for an entire month, broadcast two-a-days with Mug Club Quarantine.
[02:19:28.300 --> 02:19:30.002]  The entire staff right here from this very studio.
[02:19:30.282 --> 02:19:37.508]  Because of Mug Club, during that same time, we were able to introduce whistleblowers like Dr. Peter McCullough, other practicing biologists to the world.
[02:19:37.989 --> 02:19:39.950]  The very first week of lockdown.
[02:19:40.991 --> 02:19:45.095]  And when we were suspended for daring to question the status quo, we survived.
[02:19:45.355 --> 02:19:46.616]  Completely demonetized.
[02:19:47.137 --> 02:19:47.837]  We can keep fighting.
[02:19:48.558 --> 02:19:49.219]  Because of Mug Club.
[02:19:49.879 --> 02:20:13.227]   And because of Mug Club, when on the very same day, we're making some announcements here today, But think of this, the very same day Alex Jones was de-platformed from YouTube, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Spotify, along with a warning that anyone hosting him would be suspended themselves, and many of his so-called friends abandoned him, we hosted him immediately, and we wore that suspension with honor.
[02:20:14.281 --> 02:20:15.302]  Completely demonetized.
[02:20:15.882 --> 02:20:17.143]  We can keep fighting because of Mug Club.
[02:20:17.343 --> 02:20:27.191]  And because we did, and because so many of you watched and joined, YouTube reversed course and allowed Alex Jones to appear on programs just as a guest moving forward.
[02:20:27.331 --> 02:20:29.853]  He just wasn't allowed to host a program of his own, they said.
[02:20:30.133 --> 02:20:35.117]  And so, because of Mug Club, we immediately allowed Alex Jones to fill in host for this very show.
[02:20:38.619 --> 02:20:40.741]  And we wore our immediate suspension with pride.
[02:20:41.676 --> 02:20:44.780]  Completely demonetized, we could keep fighting and growing because of Mug Club.
[02:20:45.021 --> 02:20:56.336]  Mug Club is why we were able to cover the lied-about origins of COVID-19 and the potential side effects of the experimental mRNA injection while it was strictly forbidden, before it was allowed.
[02:20:58.740 --> 02:21:18.365]  And Mug Club is why, when even nearly, not nearly, every mainstream conservative that we can think of said that we lived through the most secure election of our lifetime, which you can count on one hand exceptions, we were able to cover exactly why that was verifiably, irrefutably untrue, while it was strictly, again, forbidden to do so on YouTube and Facebook.
[02:21:19.425 --> 02:21:22.446]  Until YouTube just officially announced that it'll be allowed.
[02:21:24.127 --> 02:21:25.127]  And that's the most important part.
[02:21:26.013 --> 02:21:29.136]  Something that maybe we take for granted and you take for granted.
[02:21:29.977 --> 02:21:33.181]  When I say it's you, it's not just a buzzword.
[02:21:33.941 --> 02:21:41.301]   It's precisely because of you, Mug Club, that these things are now even permissible
[02:21:41.301 --> 02:21:55.541]  on these big tech platforms.
[02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:56.420]  Son of a bitch.
[02:21:57.621 --> 02:21:59.801]  Because seriously, Mug Club is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:00.461 --> 02:22:09.564]  Mug Club can't, for all of its flaws, and there are many, Gerald, Mug Club cannot be bought, sold, or bargained with.
[02:22:09.784 --> 02:22:10.705]  That's the reputation.
[02:22:10.945 --> 02:22:11.525]  Take it or leave it.
[02:22:11.785 --> 02:22:19.747]   And when an entity like that, when an entity comprised of nothing more than all of you, all of you, You are who we serve.
[02:22:19.987 --> 02:22:20.988]  You are to whom we are beholden.
[02:22:21.348 --> 02:22:26.172]  And you're the driver of billions of views and listeners, cumulatively.
[02:22:27.012 --> 02:22:32.997]  The people who want to silence you, who want to dictate what you hear, who hate everything you stand for, well, guess what?
[02:22:33.177 --> 02:22:34.658]  They can't deplatform us all.
[02:22:35.639 --> 02:22:37.280]  They'd have no one left to do business with.
[02:22:38.481 --> 02:22:44.545]  So now, as a full-fledged network, and the announcements we're about to make, and continue to make, Mug Club is bigger than them.
[02:22:45.346 --> 02:22:46.487]  Mug Club is why we don't need them.
[02:22:47.304 --> 02:22:49.947]  And that's why all of us here are genuinely free.
[02:22:50.247 --> 02:22:53.891]  You, Mug Club, are the reason that they are scared.
[02:22:54.932 --> 02:22:55.513]  And they should be.
[02:22:55.533 --> 02:22:58.035]  Because wait till you see what's next.
[02:22:58.175 --> 02:22:59.236]  This was just phase one.
[02:22:59.256 --> 02:23:05.343]  Hey everyone, this is Steven Crowder.
[02:23:05.363 --> 02:23:07.205]  What we're talking about is free speech.
[02:23:11.755 --> 02:23:12.575]  Steven Crowder.
[02:23:12.715 --> 02:23:14.216]  It's very offensive.
[02:23:14.276 --> 02:23:15.056]  Very offensive.
[02:23:15.136 --> 02:23:16.817]  Yeah, thanks for having me, Steven.
[02:23:21.098 --> 02:23:25.680]  Piece of living garbage ass dumpster fire!
[02:23:27.060 --> 02:23:30.681]  I can guarantee you, multiple people right here have been raped!
[02:23:30.781 --> 02:23:31.101]  What?
[02:23:31.581 --> 02:23:33.162]  How can you guarantee that?
[02:23:33.001 --> 02:23:36.440]  People call me the Tony Robbins of assassinations.
[02:23:36.440 --> 02:23:38.441]  [MUSIC]
[02:23:38.441 --> 02:23:41.721]   I'm trying to watch, I'm trying to watch this mother watch daily,
[02:23:41.721 --> 02:23:43.561]  I don't wanna get my money's worth.
[02:23:43.561 --> 02:23:45.961]  [MUSIC]
[02:23:45.961 --> 02:23:48.721]  Hey, what the?
[02:23:48.721 --> 02:23:51.241]   And I'm gonna drown every last damn day, my baby, come across.
[02:23:51.274 --> 02:23:55.196]  Whether it's a runoff, walkoff, demon baby off, I'll go off when the demon baby comes.
[02:23:55.015 --> 02:23:58.015]  [music]
[02:23:58.015 --> 02:24:01.015]  Brian Kelly!
[02:24:01.015 --> 02:24:04.015]  [applause]
[02:24:04.015 --> 02:24:06.015]  My girl wanted me to run an errand.
[02:24:06.203 --> 02:24:08.444]  And she goes, take my bike.
[02:24:09.084 --> 02:24:11.226]  But it has a basket on the front of it.
[02:24:11.546 --> 02:24:14.207]  I was like, I'm gonna walk, you know?
[02:24:14.287 --> 02:24:18.070]  I just feel like I'm a target for homophobic bandits, you know?
[02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:22.232]  Give it up for Nick DiPaolo!
[02:24:22.252 --> 02:24:22.473]  Holy shit!
[02:24:22.633 --> 02:24:25.134]  You know, most serial killers are white, but you know why?
[02:24:25.214 --> 02:24:27.095]  To be a serial killer takes a lot of effort.
[02:24:27.115 --> 02:24:28.316]  It's like a full-time job.
[02:24:29.377 --> 02:24:31.238]  Black crime is just quick and fucking simple.
[02:24:31.558 --> 02:24:32.579]  You know that show, The First 48?
[02:24:32.659 --> 02:24:34.960]  They have a new one, The First 48 Seconds.
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:35.840]  It's just black crimes.
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:36.840]  [music]
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:45.159]  I've never heard the N-word so much in my life.
[02:24:45.207 --> 02:24:46.488]  And I had a racist grandmother.
[02:24:50.703 --> 02:24:52.165]  We'll commence again!
[02:24:51.984 --> 02:24:54.224]  (laughing)
[02:24:54.224 --> 02:24:58.184]  That's funny 'cause they're twins.
[02:24:58.184 --> 02:25:06.944]  We should fight with unwavering confidence.
[02:25:06.944 --> 02:25:07.784]  For love!
[02:25:07.784 --> 02:25:08.624]  Freedom!
[02:25:08.624 --> 02:25:18.064]   The comedy specials, we have new shows, the investigative unit, which we've discussed.
[02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:19.750]  And again, you get a free shirt at lotto.com.
[02:25:19.770 --> 02:25:24.372]  But we have another announcement to make regarding a new acquisition here.
[02:25:24.432 --> 02:25:26.553]  And by the way, I'll be taking your chats here after this.
[02:25:26.613 --> 02:25:28.535]  We'll be taking some questions from the press.
[02:25:28.675 --> 02:25:31.376]  So you can send your chats in right now on Mug Club.
[02:25:31.616 --> 02:25:34.438]  And we'll be releasing more information regarding some of the developments.
[02:25:35.138 --> 02:25:38.552]   But this is one that we're all Pretty excited about.
[02:25:39.252 --> 02:25:42.814]  And again, if it was just business, it wouldn't make sense.
[02:25:47.317 --> 02:25:56.663]  This is a man who was removed from the platforms of Apple, Spotify, Google, Facebook, Meta, X, whatever the hell it is, all on the same day.
[02:25:56.963 --> 02:25:57.984]  But there's no coordination.
[02:25:58.004 --> 02:25:59.905]  It's just coincidence.
[02:26:01.271 --> 02:26:04.252]  And there were, by the way, many people back then who said, well, that's just him.
[02:26:04.972 --> 02:26:05.853]  He's too extreme.
[02:26:06.353 --> 02:26:07.353]  That's just an isolated case.
[02:26:07.393 --> 02:26:08.173]  It won't happen to me.
[02:26:08.553 --> 02:26:10.854]  Well, are you paying attention now?
[02:26:13.515 --> 02:26:20.778]  And so people who we all expect to stand in the line of fire, who are supposed to be brothers in arms, tucked tail and ran.
[02:26:21.738 --> 02:26:28.260]  They struck plea bargains with the platforms who, for a period of time, would punish anyone who even hosted him as a guest.
[02:26:29.781 --> 02:26:30.761]  This is the canary in the coal mine.
[02:26:32.486 --> 02:26:35.927]  These people at these big tech platforms, they tell you that they'll never come for you.
[02:26:36.427 --> 02:26:46.009]  That you can keep your tens of millions in revenue, or millions that you make from their platforms, and really all that means is that if you're lucky, really lucky, they'll kill you last.
[02:26:46.950 --> 02:26:50.010]  Well, they tried to kill this next man first.
[02:26:51.431 --> 02:26:53.751]  And if he's honest, he'll tell you they almost did.
[02:26:53.771 --> 02:26:56.152]  They did a lot of damage.
[02:26:57.148 --> 02:27:06.390]  But if there's one thing you can say about this man, love him or hate him, is that he will fight for this country with every last breath in his body, and he just won't die.
[02:27:07.211 --> 02:27:23.455]  So it's with as much pride that I can convey, and as much surprise, by the way, as you, in landing this white whale, the number one draft pick, without a doubt, out there, that for the first time he will launch his subscription network exclusively under the Mug Club umbrella, starting with his new Friday show.
[02:27:24.315 --> 02:27:37.557]  On August 18th, ladies and gentlemen... I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[02:27:39.558 --> 02:27:40.498]  Hitler took the guns!
[02:27:40.738 --> 02:27:41.778]  Stalin took the guns!
[02:27:41.798 --> 02:27:42.958]  Mao took the guns!
[02:27:42.978 --> 02:27:44.679]  And El Castro took the guns!
[02:27:44.719 --> 02:27:45.899]  Hugo Chavez took the guns!
[02:27:47.338 --> 02:27:51.738]  And if you try to take our guns, 1776 will commence again!
[02:27:51.738 --> 02:27:55.097]  [Music]
[02:27:55.097 --> 02:28:00.938]   Sticking with Facebook, it is one of several companies today that are limiting the content of Far Right podcast.
[02:28:01.021 --> 02:28:01.721]  InfoWars.
[02:28:01.741 --> 02:28:06.985]  Facebook, Apple, and YouTube have all taken down content from Jones and his InfoWars channel.
[02:28:07.085 --> 02:28:10.967]  Whenever I talk about Alex Jones, my wife will not let me into the house until I've been deloused.
[02:28:11.508 --> 02:28:16.491]  Anyone who believes in Alex Jones and believes these theories, you really gotta go get help.
[02:28:16.430 --> 02:28:21.430]  Alex Jones has been ordered to pay 965 million dollars.
[02:28:21.430 --> 02:28:26.430]  Look how they've removed the control information.
[02:28:26.364 --> 02:28:27.305]  There's always been.
[02:28:27.705 --> 02:28:31.745]  And it ought to scare people that you've got a move to indoctrinate the children of America.
[02:28:32.025 --> 02:28:36.286]  If they can get you to be part of a group, an environmentalist or part of your minority group.
[02:28:36.306 --> 02:28:41.187]  Black, Latino, and indigenous people are suffering and dying disproportionately.
[02:28:41.207 --> 02:28:44.287]  The most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland is white supremacy.
[02:28:44.307 --> 02:28:48.428]  They'll have their little tailor-made people that are bought and paid for to claim to be your leader.
[02:28:48.968 --> 02:28:51.449]  We're looking at a giant war in February right now.
[02:28:51.768 --> 02:28:53.768]  Currently, that's the projection.
[02:28:53.768 --> 02:29:03.008]   There's an entire agenda afoot to force the population to undergo
[02:29:03.008 --> 02:29:06.768]  different type of medical treatments, namely vaccines.
[02:29:06.768 --> 02:29:08.768]  In 2008...
[02:29:08.208 --> 02:29:19.196]  In 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World Order, pushing for world-wide government, a cashless society.
[02:29:19.496 --> 02:29:21.357]  If any terrorism comes, it's from this government.
[02:29:21.678 --> 02:29:31.324]   And if there was an outside threat like Bin Laden, who was a known CIS in the 80s, running the Mujahideen War, He's family builds all the military bases over in Saudi Arabia right now.
[02:29:31.524 --> 02:29:33.245]  He sits on the board of Iridium Satellite.
[02:29:33.485 --> 02:29:35.727]  He's the boogeyman they need.
[02:29:35.887 --> 02:29:36.927]  I've been shadowbanned.
[02:29:37.728 --> 02:29:39.029]  I've been called a liar.
[02:29:39.769 --> 02:29:43.151]  I've been silenced on virtually every platform created by man.
[02:29:43.892 --> 02:29:46.213]  My life has been threatened, repeatedly.
[02:29:46.793 --> 02:29:49.415]  They've tried to destroy me, but I survived.
[02:29:50.495 --> 02:29:52.877]  And that's why I'm joining Mug Club.
[02:29:57.339 --> 02:29:59.680]  Alex Jones, everybody!
[02:30:02.280 --> 02:30:09.882]  Thank you.
[02:30:12.522 --> 02:30:14.423]  Listen, I want to thank everybody tuning in.
[02:30:14.443 --> 02:30:18.063]  I want to thank everybody tuning in right now, but I'm going to be deadly serious here.
[02:30:18.543 --> 02:30:20.364]  I've not been this excited ever!
[02:30:20.524 --> 02:30:25.065]  Yeah, Mud Club, baby!
[02:30:25.085 --> 02:30:25.245]  Wow!
[02:30:26.167 --> 02:30:27.828]  I've known Steven for more than 10 years.
[02:30:27.908 --> 02:30:29.469]  Used to, you know, beg him to come on my show.
[02:30:29.509 --> 02:30:32.211]  Always a really busy guy, and he's been a bit of a popper forever.
[02:30:33.652 --> 02:30:38.856]  But we kind of knew each other, but as soon as I got deplatformed, he saw as a threat and he said, I want you on immediately.
[02:30:38.876 --> 02:30:44.680]  The day after, when everybody else was running away, including my friends, he was like, no, this is a danger to everybody.
[02:30:44.740 --> 02:30:45.481]  I see what this is.
[02:30:46.261 --> 02:30:49.043]  And then again, everybody else was shutting down during the lockdown.
[02:30:49.063 --> 02:30:49.724]  I didn't.
[02:30:49.944 --> 02:30:50.305]  He didn't.
[02:30:50.785 --> 02:30:53.487]  And so it's that type of instinctive courage that I really respect.
[02:30:53.507 --> 02:30:55.529]  We've become good friends the last three or four years.
[02:30:55.569 --> 02:30:57.290]  Since then, I love coming up here.
[02:30:57.330 --> 02:30:57.951]  I love the energy.
[02:30:57.971 --> 02:31:03.696]  And let's be clear, InfoWars isn't going anywhere or Austin Operation, my regular show that's on talk radio everywhere, but...
[02:31:05.129 --> 02:31:11.332]  We've been talking for years about some type of collaboration and he had to move from where he was to trailblaze and do this.
[02:31:12.132 --> 02:31:13.973]  And what's incredible is it's succeeding.
[02:31:14.333 --> 02:31:15.014]  But here's the key.
[02:31:15.714 --> 02:31:20.056]  We don't just have the left and the globalist and big tech and the intelligence agencies.
[02:31:20.476 --> 02:31:29.900]  We now know that we're censoring and controlling and suppressing election information and vaccine information and open border and human trafficking information, fentanyl info and Afghan withdrawal info.
[02:31:31.021 --> 02:31:46.974]   It's the big think tanks that Crowder alluded to earlier that are so-called conservative that have billions of dollars over the last decade to buy and control the populist, nationalist, common-sense capitalist movement that this country was founded on that made it the apple of the world's eye.
[02:31:47.674 --> 02:31:53.880]  And so we're not just challenging the left and Hollywood and big tech, we're challenging Conservative Inc.
[02:31:53.900 --> 02:31:59.064]   And that didn't make sense to some people that weren't You know, clued in or on the inside of what really goes on.
[02:31:59.624 --> 02:32:13.734]  Six months ago, when Crowder was making a big deal about the other big conservative platforms that aren't conservative, they interfaced with YouTube and Facebook, and before Twitter was sold to Musk, and literally sit around in smoky rooms laughing at the conservatives.
[02:32:14.034 --> 02:32:14.715]  And I've been around it.
[02:32:14.755 --> 02:32:19.618]  It's disgusting to people that have authenticity, like Steven Crowder and this incredible crew.
[02:32:20.199 --> 02:32:21.520]  These are real people.
[02:32:21.580 --> 02:32:21.740]  No.
[02:32:21.920 --> 02:32:23.201]  These are real people right here.
[02:32:24.284 --> 02:32:30.607]  Gerald Morgan, all of these comedians, all these people have turned down tens of millions of dollars to tell the truth.
[02:32:31.267 --> 02:32:37.430]  I mean, there's people out there like Ted Nugent lost probably a hundred million dollars the last six, seven years supporting Trump.
[02:32:37.450 --> 02:32:38.050]  It's been in the news.
[02:32:38.290 --> 02:32:39.991]  Just no more stadiums, no more nothing.
[02:32:40.651 --> 02:32:41.292]  It's over for him.
[02:32:41.312 --> 02:32:43.193]  So there's not many people like that.
[02:32:43.233 --> 02:32:44.613]  Probably should bring Ted Nugent over here.
[02:32:46.874 --> 02:32:50.436]  What I'm getting down to is we need an independent network that isn't controlled.
[02:32:50.696 --> 02:32:57.420]  And I'm sorry, Twitter is better than some of the other so-called conservative or open platforms, but it's still not even halfway free.
[02:32:58.020 --> 02:32:59.901]  Yeah, halfway free feels better than no free.
[02:33:00.281 --> 02:33:01.722]  And I'm not even criticizing Twitter.
[02:33:01.782 --> 02:33:03.063]  It's just, it's just not free.
[02:33:03.523 --> 02:33:10.207]  So many really effective people that expose Communist China and certain owners of Twitter's connection to it, they're all still censored.
[02:33:11.066 --> 02:33:12.066]  not Mug Club.
[02:33:12.066 --> 02:33:15.226]   And I know the plan that Crowder has, he's told me about it, he's told you a lot about
[02:33:15.226 --> 02:33:20.546]   it, is to literally bring on hundreds of providers, and I guess the long term even thousands,
[02:33:20.546 --> 02:33:25.505]   and then use the great folks at Rumble that really are free and open to energize this.
[02:33:25.505 --> 02:33:28.826]   So people always say, "Hey, if you want your own internet, why don't you build it?
[02:33:28.826 --> 02:33:30.346]  Or you want your own platform, build it."
[02:33:30.346 --> 02:33:34.745]   Well, it's very hard to do, but he's been able to do it because of you, the Mug Club
[02:33:34.745 --> 02:33:36.506]  members, and that gives him that independence.
[02:33:36.611 --> 02:33:39.973]  So you literally aren't just the tail of the dog, you're the whole shootin' match.
[02:33:39.993 --> 02:33:47.976]  You're the whole dog, the teeth, the brain, you know, the feet, the guts, the heart, the brain, the eyes and ears with the investigative unit and everything.
[02:33:48.237 --> 02:33:52.158]  You are this operation, and if you get excited about this, it's game over for the New World Order.
[02:33:52.498 --> 02:33:55.699]   Listen, we came and founded a new country to get away from tyranny.
[02:33:55.699 --> 02:33:58.738]   We weren't perfect, but it became the freest, greatest thing ever.
[02:33:58.738 --> 02:34:04.498]   So it's that the Israelites left Egypt under Ramesses II,
[02:34:04.498 --> 02:34:07.578]   and they've now dug up all the tablets and the history, and that's a true story.
[02:34:07.578 --> 02:34:08.417]  It really happened.
[02:34:08.417 --> 02:34:10.498]  It's on the Egyptian hieroglyphs as well.
[02:34:10.498 --> 02:34:13.557]   So Stephen Crowder and the Mug Club and this whole operation
[02:34:13.557 --> 02:34:18.498]   is literally leading everybody out of Egypt, and we don't have to wait 50 years or 40 years
[02:34:18.498 --> 02:34:19.858]  to cross the River Jordan, folks.
[02:34:19.858 --> 02:34:21.177]  We're doing it right now.
[02:34:21.177 --> 02:34:23.578]  It's already launched out of the gate successful.
[02:34:23.578 --> 02:34:29.058]   That is a true American success story of dedication, work, not backing down,
[02:34:29.058 --> 02:34:31.599]  and it challenges the entire system.
[02:34:31.599 --> 02:34:35.099]   So when this is successful, and it already is, but I mean super successful,
[02:34:35.099 --> 02:34:39.158]   it will then be the example to all the other big so-called conservative
[02:34:39.158 --> 02:34:42.177]   populist talk show hosts who don't like serving the globalists
[02:34:42.177 --> 02:34:47.757]   but are too scared to buck 'em to let them then have the courage to follow us.
[02:34:47.757 --> 02:34:53.238]   So this is true leadership and history that you're watching right now today.
[02:34:53.238 --> 02:34:54.918]  Now, here's another key point.
[02:34:54.918 --> 02:34:58.918]   If you look at the 40-plus billion that Anheuser-Busch has lost
[02:34:58.918 --> 02:35:04.279]   with the entire debacle with Bud Light, that's a great example of us saying
[02:35:04.279 --> 02:35:07.798]   we're gonna withdraw support of people targeting children and sexualization
[02:35:07.798 --> 02:35:09.759]  and this whole transhumanist movement.
[02:35:09.162 --> 02:35:09.663]  That's what it is.
[02:35:10.483 --> 02:35:13.304]  I mean, you all know Harari at the WEF says, oh, this is just the beginning.
[02:35:13.324 --> 02:35:16.366]  If you'll accept two men having a baby, you'll accept cyborgs, all the rest of it.
[02:35:16.606 --> 02:35:19.307]  Clones, animal-human hybrids, which is all out in the open now.
[02:35:19.848 --> 02:35:22.689]  But instead of just boycotts, what about bycots?
[02:35:23.209 --> 02:35:24.550]  And that's what this is, folks.
[02:35:24.910 --> 02:35:29.530]   You get all these great shows, all these great memberships, all these great things and know that you're
[02:35:29.530 --> 02:35:35.529]   part of history, bucking the system, American Revolution, 1776, Worldwide 2.0.
[02:35:35.529 --> 02:35:37.170]  So the boycotts are great.
[02:35:37.170 --> 02:35:41.129]   Pull your money out of the globalist system, but then spend it with the institutions and
[02:35:41.129 --> 02:35:43.329]  organizations that are standing in freedom.
[02:35:43.329 --> 02:35:47.010]   If Anheuser-Busch just lost, I think the number I saw last week was 41 billion, it just keeps
[02:35:47.010 --> 02:35:51.890]  going up and up, 25% market share in all of their products.
[02:35:51.890 --> 02:35:55.850]   Think about what would happen if people spent a billion on Mug Club instead of 10 million
[02:35:56.498 --> 02:36:00.002]  Because this guy's putting almost everything back into the operation.
[02:36:00.623 --> 02:36:08.273]  Because it is about the excitement of standing up for liberty and connecting to our forefathers and foremothers that created this country.
[02:36:08.693 --> 02:36:09.454]  And that's what this is about.
[02:36:11.707 --> 02:36:20.996]  So, Stephen Crowder and the Mug Club and this whole operation is literally leading everybody out of Egypt and we don't have to wait 50 years or 40 years to cross the River Jordan, folks.
[02:36:21.016 --> 02:36:22.117]  We're doing it right now.
[02:36:22.417 --> 02:36:24.519]  It's already launched, out of the gate, successful.
[02:36:24.759 --> 02:36:32.726]   That is a true American success story of dedication, work, not backing down, and it challenges The entire system.
[02:36:32.787 --> 02:36:48.615]  So when this is successful, and it already is, but I mean super successful, it will then be the example to all the other big so-called conservative populist talk show hosts who don't like serving the globalists but are too scared to buck them to let them then have the courage to follow us.
[02:36:48.975 --> 02:36:50.996]  So this is true leadership.
[02:36:51.576 --> 02:36:54.379]  And history that you're watching right now today.
[02:36:54.419 --> 02:36:55.660]  Now here's another key point.
[02:36:56.161 --> 02:37:10.356]  If you look at the 40 plus billion that Anheuser-Busch has lost with the entire debacle with Bud Light, that's a great example of us saying we're going to withdraw support of people targeting children and sexualization and this whole transhumanist movement.
[02:37:10.376 --> 02:37:10.836]  That's what it is.
[02:37:11.673 --> 02:37:14.495]  I mean, you all know Harari at the WEF says, oh, this is just the beginning.
[02:37:14.515 --> 02:37:20.499]  If you'll accept two men having a baby, you'll accept cyborgs, all the rest of it, clones, animal-human hybrids, which is all out in the open now.
[02:37:21.020 --> 02:37:23.882]  But instead of just boycotts, what about bycots?
[02:37:24.402 --> 02:37:25.743]  And that's what this is, folks.
[02:37:26.103 --> 02:37:36.451]  You get all these great shows, all these great memberships, all these great things, and know that you're part of history, bucking the system, American Revolution, 1776, Worldwide 2.0.
[02:37:36.691 --> 02:37:37.872]  So the boycotts are great.
[02:37:38.252 --> 02:37:43.717]  Pull your money out of the globalist system, but then spend it with the institutions and organizations that are standing in freedom.
[02:37:44.498 --> 02:37:47.821]  If Anheuser-Busch just lost, I think the number I saw last week was 41 billion.
[02:37:47.861 --> 02:37:49.483]  It just keeps going up and up.
[02:37:49.823 --> 02:37:51.645]  25% market share in all of their products.
[02:37:52.947 --> 02:37:57.470]  Think about what would happen if people spent a billion on Mug Club instead of 10 million or whatever.
[02:37:57.690 --> 02:38:01.172]  Because this guy's putting almost everything back into the operation.
[02:38:01.812 --> 02:38:09.456]  Because it is about the excitement of standing up for liberty and connecting to our forefathers and foremothers that created this country.
[02:38:09.876 --> 02:38:10.637]  And that's what this is about.
[02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:17.223]  Business sense to not roll over and make the hundreds of millions assault the system.
[02:38:17.263 --> 02:38:19.926]  But wait, if the whole country and the world's gone, that money doesn't matter.
[02:38:20.006 --> 02:38:21.607]  It makes perfect business sense.
[02:38:21.527 --> 02:38:28.527]   Because our business is prosperity and freedom and justice and Americana 1776 worldwide!
[02:38:28.527 --> 02:38:31.527]  [applause]
[02:38:31.527 --> 02:38:33.527]  So that's what this is all about.
[02:38:33.562 --> 02:38:38.806]  So we've been talking for six months about doing this, and I said, well, I'm going to keep them going, the great crew we do.
[02:38:39.386 --> 02:38:41.247]  And they thought, and I said, what's your idea?
[02:38:41.267 --> 02:38:42.328]  And I had my idea already written down.
[02:38:42.348 --> 02:38:46.772]  They said, a once a week show, build off that, then start building some other shows.
[02:38:47.292 --> 02:38:55.378]  And with the funding we get from this, we'll be able to hire back more reporters, do more investigative stuff on the ground at the border and at Bilderberg and at Davos and the RNC and DNC.
[02:38:55.418 --> 02:38:56.859]  So this is a match made in heaven.
[02:38:57.379 --> 02:39:02.221]   Everybody Needs to tell your friends, your family, your neighbors, hey, you want a second American Revolution?
[02:39:02.421 --> 02:39:03.222]  You don't like what's happening?
[02:39:03.442 --> 02:39:06.703]  Well, this is the group, this is the organization that is the best there is.
[02:39:06.943 --> 02:39:08.883]  We're not up here saying, you know, we're Superman.
[02:39:08.903 --> 02:39:10.304]  We're not up here saying we have all the answers.
[02:39:10.504 --> 02:39:11.004]  But you know what?
[02:39:11.504 --> 02:39:12.785]  It's not bragging when it's fact.
[02:39:12.885 --> 02:39:23.968]  People need to recognize that this operation, what Steven Crowder and his crew are doing, is the best, open, freest, biggest thing there is in the world in opposition to the New World Order.
[02:39:24.168 --> 02:39:33.048]   And hey, you tune into my show, you're going to get You're going to get hardcore analysis and over-the-horizon information on what the globalists are planning next.
[02:39:33.088 --> 02:39:33.649]  That's all it is.
[02:39:33.669 --> 02:39:33.989]  Study it.
[02:39:34.289 --> 02:39:34.910]  It's hardcore.
[02:39:34.930 --> 02:39:36.132]  Don't slit your wrist after you watch it.
[02:39:36.552 --> 02:39:42.240]  But the good thing is, you can then tune in to the incredible, amazing, better-than-the-nighttime comedy shows.
[02:39:43.201 --> 02:39:46.562]  Live delivery of these guys, and they make it fun.
[02:39:46.582 --> 02:39:48.023]  And that's why I like the energy here.
[02:39:48.323 --> 02:39:52.165]  It's quite frankly, InfoWars, great crew, great people, but it's like you are in a bunker.
[02:39:52.365 --> 02:39:54.506]  We've been doing it 20-something years, and it's crazy.
[02:39:54.766 --> 02:40:00.968]  So it's a breath of fresh air to just add this family to what's happening, to be part of this organization, and to have the InfoWars crew.
[02:40:01.268 --> 02:40:02.869]  Now you're becoming part of this organization.
[02:40:02.949 --> 02:40:04.410]  I'm just blessed and honored.
[02:40:04.450 --> 02:40:05.010]  It's incredible.
[02:40:05.390 --> 02:40:11.376]  And at 11 a.m., just coming up in about an hour from now, I'll do my live show out of the classic Steven Crowder Studios.
[02:40:11.396 --> 02:40:13.458]  We're going to have these guys in here with us.
[02:40:13.919 --> 02:40:14.719]  It's so exciting.
[02:40:14.739 --> 02:40:15.280]  So, 11 a.m.
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:18.463]  Central, InfoWars.com, forward slash show and band out video.
[02:40:18.483 --> 02:40:23.168]  But I want everybody watching, that means on InfoWars everywhere, to be part of this revolutionary act.
[02:40:23.208 --> 02:40:24.049]  You want resistance?
[02:40:24.289 --> 02:40:25.230]  You want somebody to stand up?
[02:40:25.250 --> 02:40:26.091]  You want somebody to fight?
[02:40:26.411 --> 02:40:28.773]  Go now to the Mug Club.
[02:40:29.754 --> 02:40:34.815]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, use the promo codes that are there to get a month off.
[02:40:35.196 --> 02:40:35.776]  Do it now.
[02:40:36.076 --> 02:40:36.816]  Go to Mug Club.
[02:40:37.096 --> 02:40:39.497]  Take action, because the globalists want war.
[02:40:39.737 --> 02:40:40.657]  They want to destroy us.
[02:40:40.857 --> 02:40:41.377]  Well, guess what?
[02:40:41.417 --> 02:40:42.397]  We didn't start this fight.
[02:40:42.437 --> 02:40:43.018]  We don't want it.
[02:40:43.277 --> 02:40:50.277]  But if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[02:40:50.277 --> 02:40:57.277]  [Applause]
[02:40:57.277 --> 02:41:01.917]  Well that is groundbreaking news right there from Alex.
[02:41:02.006 --> 02:41:07.853]  A big congratulations to Alex, Mug Club, the whole team, Stephen Crowder, InfoWars.
[02:41:07.933 --> 02:41:10.576]  What a powerhouse duo right now.
[02:41:10.596 --> 02:41:14.501]  I just am so supportive of independent media.
[02:41:14.561 --> 02:41:17.324]   Independent media is so So crucial.
[02:41:17.364 --> 02:41:22.449]  You're going to understand why it's so crucial today, or at least it's going to cement it in for you.
[02:41:22.790 --> 02:41:30.237]  But I'm just asking everyone who's tuning in today to support this project and continue supporting the truth to get out there.
[02:41:30.357 --> 02:41:41.449]   Anyone who is willing to stare into the face of these globalists and tell you what is really going on right now, I'm telling you, This is a huge moment in history.
[02:41:41.770 --> 02:41:42.951]  These people are brave.
[02:41:43.252 --> 02:41:46.136]  These people are the warriors of the modern age.
[02:41:46.516 --> 02:41:50.221]  And it is a brave act to tell the truth today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:50.761 --> 02:41:51.983]  Why is it such a brave act?
[02:41:52.023 --> 02:41:55.427]  Because the truth is considered hate speech today.
[02:41:56.188 --> 02:41:57.248]  Everything's inverted.
[02:41:57.549 --> 02:41:59.429]  What is good is being called evil.
[02:41:59.489 --> 02:42:01.410]  What is evil is being called good.
[02:42:01.510 --> 02:42:04.111]  And this is the age that we are living in.
[02:42:04.451 --> 02:42:30.418]   So right now, the most powerful way to dispel the lies, and this is true throughout all of history, Is to tell the truth and break through the deception that is gripping mankind right now through language, through media, through the propaganda that you see, through algorithms that are targeted at controlling your brain, changing your behavior and turning you into something that you don't recognize.
[02:42:31.298 --> 02:42:33.899]  The antidote to that is the truth.
[02:42:35.199 --> 02:42:37.820]  If you didn't have the truth, you would not know yourself.
[02:42:38.806 --> 02:42:40.728]  Think about that statement right now.
[02:42:41.088 --> 02:42:49.094]  If you did not have the truth, you would not know yourself because you would be a victim of the propaganda that's out there.
[02:42:49.174 --> 02:42:51.576]  It's not just the mainstream media.
[02:42:52.657 --> 02:42:56.340]  It's algorithms that are targeted at keeping you docile.
[02:42:56.540 --> 02:43:03.025]  Algorithms that are targeted at keeping you distracted and entertained while the world is literally on fire.
[02:43:04.375 --> 02:43:07.017]  And the world is literally on fire, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:07.037 --> 02:43:22.308]  The Great Reset is in full swing, clawing at the very last straws that it has for its survival because of the number of people waking up to this, because the truth has broken through the algorithm, it's broken through the mind control program.
[02:43:22.688 --> 02:43:30.534]  Millions of people around the world are realizing something is wrong, and they're looking for answers, and it's broadcast like this one.
[02:43:32.185 --> 02:43:39.569]  It's broadcasts like this very broadcast that you're listening to right now that are going to literally save lives.
[02:43:39.789 --> 02:43:41.269]  I am not exaggerating.
[02:43:42.870 --> 02:43:43.991]  I am not exaggerating.
[02:43:44.031 --> 02:43:48.613]  This is going to save the lives of adults, of children.
[02:43:49.824 --> 02:44:03.272]  Of this current generation and generations to come, the words that you hear on this broadcast will last beyond the lies because lies eventually become decimated or they become uncovered, but the truth is something that remains.
[02:44:04.973 --> 02:44:12.737]  So please consider, continue to support Alex and the team here in whatever ventures they move forward with.
[02:44:13.497 --> 02:44:18.000]  InfoWars is so, so important to the future of humanity.
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:20.341]  And I say that as a contributor.
[02:44:21.622 --> 02:44:29.866]  I say that as someone who's depended on InfoWars for many years as the forefront of the battle.
[02:44:31.888 --> 02:44:34.869]  It's about time the rest of humanity realizes it.
[02:44:36.350 --> 02:44:40.873]  I want to talk to you today about the satanic pedophiles at the United Nations.
[02:44:42.133 --> 02:44:43.154]  And that is what they are.
[02:44:44.275 --> 02:44:49.101]   The people at the top of this food chain Or at least those in the public eye.
[02:44:49.121 --> 02:44:55.685]  And I've spoken about this before, the fact that these people, if you know them, they're not at the top of the food chain.
[02:44:55.705 --> 02:44:57.166]  They're not the ones calling the shots.
[02:44:57.226 --> 02:45:12.157]  But let's talk about the three front organisations that we have right now, being the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, and the World Health Organisation, that seek to enslave you into their satanic New Babylon system.
[02:45:12.197 --> 02:45:13.799]  That is what it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:45:13.859 --> 02:45:15.380]  And I want to make this clear.
[02:45:16.565 --> 02:45:18.326]  You may not believe in God.
[02:45:18.666 --> 02:45:20.327]  You may not believe in Satan.
[02:45:20.387 --> 02:45:30.471]  You may not believe that the practices that these people participate in hold any power, but they do.
[02:45:31.952 --> 02:45:42.317]  And what kind of an uninformed, naive individual, if they, say, work within the military, would go to war with an enemy that they don't understand?
[02:45:44.578 --> 02:45:51.063]   If you are You don't go into a war with an enemy blind.
[02:45:51.103 --> 02:45:52.203]  You study that enemy.
[02:45:52.484 --> 02:45:54.105]  You understand the way they think.
[02:45:54.145 --> 02:45:55.505]  You understand their culture.
[02:45:55.565 --> 02:45:57.206]  You understand their battle plans.
[02:45:57.246 --> 02:46:01.549]  You understand the way that they conduct themselves in war.
[02:46:01.869 --> 02:46:03.290]  You know what weapons they have.
[02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:06.092]  You know what strategies they deploy.
[02:46:06.413 --> 02:46:19.724]  You go and you assess those strategies in detail before you go and attack that enemy or before you defend your- even if you want to defend yourself against that enemy, you must understand them inside out.
[02:46:20.124 --> 02:46:25.849]  Your enemy, humanity, everyone listening today, your enemy worships Satan.
[02:46:27.651 --> 02:46:31.014]  Your enemy conducts child sacrifice.
[02:46:32.069 --> 02:46:34.612]  Your enemy feeds on the blood of children.
[02:46:35.372 --> 02:46:37.234]  This is their belief system.
[02:46:41.138 --> 02:46:44.321]  No matter what you think about that practice, they do it.
[02:46:45.682 --> 02:46:46.303]  They do it.
[02:46:46.984 --> 02:46:54.191]  They have ancient, occult, human sacrifice practices that they engage in regularly.
[02:46:56.184 --> 02:47:11.348]  So the sooner humanity accepts that the people at the top of the food chain are engaging in these ancient occult practices, the easier it will be for them to understand that the people that they're up against aren't just wanting control only.
[02:47:11.368 --> 02:47:14.489]  This goes far beyond just control.
[02:47:14.529 --> 02:47:15.269]  They have money.
[02:47:15.589 --> 02:47:16.970]  They don't need more money.
[02:47:17.050 --> 02:47:18.690]  They have all the money they want.
[02:47:18.730 --> 02:47:20.031]  They just keep printing it.
[02:47:20.431 --> 02:47:24.652]  And if the fiat system fails, they go and create a new system of fake money.
[02:47:26.835 --> 02:47:29.377]  It's not just about following the money trail.
[02:47:31.479 --> 02:47:36.443]  This is about the soul of every single human on earth.
[02:47:36.703 --> 02:47:38.405]  This is their ultimate goal.
[02:47:38.445 --> 02:47:40.626]  They want your soul.
[02:47:41.147 --> 02:47:42.948]  They want to destroy you.
[02:47:42.968 --> 02:48:02.676]   And this latest report that I'm going to cover today from these psychopaths called Report of the Independent Expert on Protection Against Violence and Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.
[02:48:02.737 --> 02:48:08.219]  This is who they call an independent expert that's written this report.
[02:48:09.779 --> 02:48:13.380]  Okay, now let me tell you about this independent expert.
[02:48:13.860 --> 02:48:16.341]  His name is Victor Madrigal-Balos.
[02:48:16.721 --> 02:48:27.644]  He attended the World Economic Forum Sustainable Development Impact Summit in 2020 and spoke on including LGBTI populations in response to the COVID-19 crisis.
[02:48:27.764 --> 02:48:28.204]  Crisis?
[02:48:31.235 --> 02:48:40.737]  When asked what actions can be taken to ensure that the responses leave no one behind and contribute to achieving the 2030 agenda, Victor Madrigal-Borlaz responded.
[02:48:42.617 --> 02:48:58.921]  And it says, independent expert on sexual orientation and gender identity, United Nations, opened the session by saying, we had reasonable assumptions that during this type of situation there is usually an escalation of risk and discrimination and also hate speech.
[02:48:59.696 --> 02:49:03.900]  An incitement to violence and discrimination, and in fact this proved to be the case.
[02:49:05.401 --> 02:49:14.009]  Now he is there offering his expert opinion, as an independent expert, on LGBTQI people.
[02:49:15.431 --> 02:49:34.045]   What statistics do we have to suggest from this independent expert that the violence towards LGBTQI people Plus people, and the plus is for minor attracted persons, which is the nice way of saying pedophile that wants to do unspeakable things with your children.
[02:49:35.867 --> 02:49:36.127]  What?
[02:49:37.088 --> 02:49:44.413]  What violence increased against these people by the general population during the time of COVID?
[02:49:44.573 --> 02:49:44.973]  It didn't.
[02:49:46.134 --> 02:49:48.856]  There is no evidence that this expert has provided.
[02:49:49.857 --> 02:49:55.221]   And yet this is the basis Of his fight for human rights to stop the violence.
[02:49:55.361 --> 02:49:59.303]  What does the United Nations mean when they say violence?
[02:50:01.705 --> 02:50:13.472]  What I'm going to talk you through today is this report and I'm going to decode their language for you to help you understand exactly where this is going and I'm going to tell you the end goal from now.
[02:50:13.892 --> 02:50:21.117]  The end goal from now is to criminalize you saying anything against pedophiles.
[02:50:22.728 --> 02:50:25.830]  Because these people want to have sex with children.
[02:50:26.151 --> 02:50:27.512]  They want it to be legal.
[02:50:27.912 --> 02:50:28.733]  I have proof.
[02:50:28.913 --> 02:50:30.234]  It's in their own documents.
[02:50:31.875 --> 02:50:36.338]  They want to legalise sex with our children.
[02:50:38.180 --> 02:50:47.687]  When Biden tells you, these are our kids, it's because he's grooming you to accept these people having sex with your children.
[02:50:47.707 --> 02:50:48.507]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:48.607 --> 02:50:49.268]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:50:50.444 --> 02:50:52.128]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:52.228 --> 02:50:58.621]  I'm your guest host Maria Z from Zmedia.com coming to you live from the land down under now.
[02:50:59.344 --> 02:51:00.766]  I referenced this report before.
[02:51:00.786 --> 02:51:01.727]  We're going to go through it.
[02:51:01.747 --> 02:51:07.692]  I'm going to try not to read this word for word for everyone, but just sort of cover the main points of the report.
[02:51:07.733 --> 02:51:13.218]  And I'm just going to tell you the goal of the report from now, before we get to the actual conclusions in it.
[02:51:13.278 --> 02:51:26.479]   This report is calling for LGBTQI+, which the plus stands for, which represents minor attracted persons, which means pedophiles, For their rights to be above religious rights.
[02:51:26.539 --> 02:51:28.321]  They're calling for this to happen worldwide.
[02:51:28.361 --> 02:51:30.945]  They're calling for the silencing of religious leaders.
[02:51:31.425 --> 02:51:40.964]   And they're calling hate speech violence And we're going to have a look at what they declare, what they define, I should say, hate speech as in a moment.
[02:51:41.024 --> 02:51:47.307]  But if you want to look for this report, you can search A forward slash HRC forward slash 53 forward slash 37.
[02:51:48.167 --> 02:51:51.869]  Of course, a lot of these reports are difficult to find.
[02:51:52.849 --> 02:52:05.620]   They are, you know, often hidden within many other reports and in some sort of meetings that They're being privately funded and probably funded by the people to do which no one wants.
[02:52:05.780 --> 02:52:10.505]  No one invited these people to rule the world and yet here it is.
[02:52:10.565 --> 02:52:15.330]  They're making decisions for us and trying to dictate to us how we practice our religion and live our lives.
[02:52:15.410 --> 02:52:27.855]   So, I'll talk about what we need to do with this Idiotic organization at the end of this broadcast, but I will go through some of this report right now.
[02:52:27.975 --> 02:52:35.681]  So again, they're talking about freedom of religion or belief, freedom from violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
[02:52:36.221 --> 02:52:47.225]   Victor references FLRB a lot in the article, which is the UN General Assembly Assembly's Special Repertoire's compilation of articles on
[02:52:47.225 --> 02:52:53.094]   freedom of religion or belief and sexuality 2017, which is essentially a compilation of
[02:52:53.094 --> 02:52:56.305]   reports and discussions concerning freedom of religion.
[02:52:56.305 --> 02:53:01.825]   So, when I'm talking about FORB, that's what I'm referencing, so I don't say that whole
[02:53:01.825 --> 02:53:04.065]  thing again throughout this presentation.
[02:53:04.065 --> 02:53:10.865]   All right, so within the introduction, they say that the report focuses on spaces where
[02:53:10.865 --> 02:53:17.104]   freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief and protection from violence and
[02:53:17.104 --> 02:53:21.824]   discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity intersect.
[02:53:21.794 --> 02:53:28.995]  So they're trying to talk about, well all of these things are fusing in society, which we can't deny.
[02:53:29.015 --> 02:53:33.676]  And let me just say from the outset, I'm not against homosexuals.
[02:53:34.867 --> 02:53:50.017]  I love all people, but do I reserve the right to maintain my religious beliefs and not do anything that violates my personal convictions the same way that someone who has a different belief system to me does?
[02:53:50.158 --> 02:53:51.298]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:53:52.559 --> 02:54:06.109]   And so if I say baking the cake violates my religious beliefs, I'm well within my rights to do so, and if you were for tolerance And inclusivity, you would say, right, okay, those are your beliefs, I will go somewhere where someone shares my beliefs.
[02:54:06.269 --> 02:54:13.173]  I wouldn't go to a Hindu to get them, to force them to understand Christianity.
[02:54:13.193 --> 02:54:14.054]  You just don't do that.
[02:54:14.074 --> 02:54:17.836]  You say, okay, that Hindu has their beliefs, I'm a Christian, I'll go over here.
[02:54:19.257 --> 02:54:21.938]  But, you know, you gotta bake the cake!
[02:54:22.379 --> 02:54:23.499]  Screw your religion!
[02:54:25.961 --> 02:54:27.101]  Damn that stupid cake.
[02:54:27.942 --> 02:54:28.202]  Anyway.
[02:54:28.683 --> 02:54:29.343]  Back to the report.
[02:54:29.363 --> 02:54:30.404]  This is what it's saying.
[02:54:30.424 --> 02:54:34.206]  So it's saying, okay, these things are all fusing in society, which is true.
[02:54:34.446 --> 02:54:39.289]  We have this increase of it and we should look at how we're going to navigate this.
[02:54:39.730 --> 02:54:40.390]  I agree with that.
[02:54:40.430 --> 02:54:41.911]  Let's look at how we're going to navigate this.
[02:54:42.792 --> 02:54:51.697]  So they say that the document and the report seeks to explore fundamental conceptions about our human bonds with the sacred and the mundane.
[02:54:53.294 --> 02:55:07.843]  And goes on to sort of talk about, you know, people's sexual experiences, the pleasures and all of these other things that make up the human experience.
[02:55:09.266 --> 02:55:32.350]  He boasts about meeting with multiple religious leaders including the Patriarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church, Mufti of All Muslims, Chair of Jewish Council in Mozambique, the Mufti of Nampula, I won't read them all out but he's, you know, the Catholic Archbishop, Chief Rabbis and all sorts of other religious leaders.
[02:55:32.410 --> 02:55:34.731]  He's made the effort to go and do that.
[02:55:36.151 --> 02:55:41.652]  So that he can best understand and work together with everyone because he really wants to work together with everyone.
[02:55:41.672 --> 02:55:43.572]  We'll find out what working together means soon.
[02:55:44.553 --> 02:55:55.515]  And then he says that religion does not have essential or inbuilt positions and it would make no sense to position it as inherently or predominantly pro or anti-LGBT.
[02:55:55.555 --> 02:55:57.495]  This can be interpreted in one of two ways.
[02:55:58.435 --> 02:56:06.013]   This can be interpreted as religion does not have the right To position itself as this.
[02:56:06.673 --> 02:56:08.573]  It shouldn't be positioning itself as this.
[02:56:08.933 --> 02:56:14.635]  Screw what that religion believes and what its values are and what its traditions are.
[02:56:15.576 --> 02:56:21.778]  And I think that that's really the undertone of this entire report, which will make sense when we look at the conclusions.
[02:56:23.998 --> 02:56:32.701]  Within the legal framework that they outlined, they say that all persons should live free from violence and discrimination based on their sexual orientation and or gender identity.
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:39.201]  And that it's not an idea from a particular part of the world, it's an international standard.
[02:56:40.562 --> 02:56:50.764]  He says that the state has an obligation to adopt measures to eradicate such violence and discrimination and notes that it continues to face opposition.
[02:56:51.384 --> 02:56:58.445]  The problem that we have here is what constitutes violence and discrimination in these people's view.
[02:56:59.286 --> 02:57:00.486]  All of this sounds great.
[02:57:01.838 --> 02:57:07.021]  Same person would say, well, of course we don't want violence against anyone.
[02:57:07.822 --> 02:57:12.925]  Not just, you know, whether they're gay, straight, black, white, Chinese, it doesn't matter.
[02:57:13.605 --> 02:57:15.326]  You know, we're all different.
[02:57:15.787 --> 02:57:19.329]  We're not going to commit violence against each other just because we disagree.
[02:57:20.229 --> 02:57:22.931]  But that's not what they're talking about when they say violence.
[02:57:23.011 --> 02:57:29.675]  They're talking about saying something that hurts someone's feelings and that is provable.
[02:57:31.584 --> 02:57:46.391]  They also say that states' human rights obligations must be calibrated against the dominant religious and belief or cultural orthodoxies in national contexts.
[02:57:47.912 --> 02:58:16.692]   So he is calling for laws to be calibrated to disregard religion or cultural orthodoxies to incorporate And promote gay lifestyle, gay people, intersex people, transgender people, minor attracted persons, pedophiles.
[02:58:17.713 --> 02:58:21.056]  States' human rights obligations must be calibrated.
[02:58:21.576 --> 02:58:25.360]  It has to be against the dominant religion.
[02:58:25.961 --> 02:58:37.088]   States have to come against religions To incorporate acceptance of pedophiles into society, says the United Nations, essentially.
[02:58:37.109 --> 02:59:04.106]   The mandate has reviewed the robust evidentiary and theoretical bases that lead to the conclusion that these positions, which they say, traditional values, public morals and national values, are commonly used in discourses that are hostile to women, LGBT persons and religious and belief minorities,
[02:59:04.106 --> 02:59:10.406]   and they often rely explicitly on religious and belief norms and values, which are, he
[02:59:10.406 --> 02:59:17.186]   says, linked with patriotism and patriarchal gender and family norms, and that these
[02:59:17.186 --> 02:59:21.046]   positions are not supported by international human rights.
[02:59:21.029 --> 02:59:29.677]  So the international human rights do not support patriotism, patriarchal gender and family norms or your religious freedoms.
[02:59:30.157 --> 02:59:32.459]  We'll keep going right on the other side of this break.
[02:59:32.639 --> 02:59:33.340]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:59:33.360 --> 02:59:34.021]  We'll be right back.
[02:59:34.161 --> 02:59:38.345]  If you're watching this right now, head to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:38.445 --> 02:59:39.766]  Please support InfoWars.
[02:59:40.246 --> 02:59:51.209]  In whatever which way you can, whether it's buying high quality products, buying water filters, making a donation, please keep this broadcast alive and pumping and expanding.
[02:59:51.629 --> 02:59:53.810]  We need InfoWars like we need air.
[02:59:54.290 --> 03:00:26.240]   All right, so the mandate of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief They talk about how there are two trains of thought here, which is that you don't have the right to control someone's belief systems, but it also says that the right to manifest one's religion or belief through actions can and should be limited by states in certain circumstances.
[03:00:26.320 --> 03:00:27.001]  So why?
[03:00:29.205 --> 03:00:30.986]  Why would that have to be the case?
[03:00:31.006 --> 03:00:37.647]  Well, they talk about public safety, order, health, or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.
[03:00:37.727 --> 03:00:52.958]   Again, I'm talking about the fact that you are not allowed to, according to these people, on the basis of your religion, your belief systems, criticize, admonish, offer advice, And, you know, they talk about conversion practices here.
[03:00:52.999 --> 03:00:54.779]  You're not allowed to pray for someone.
[03:00:54.819 --> 03:01:07.646]  It's already illegal for a parent in the state of Victoria, here in Australia, if their kid comes home and says, mum, I am really thinking that, you know, a female child, I'm really thinking that I might be a boy.
[03:01:07.666 --> 03:01:12.168]  If that family says, no, sweetie, you're not a boy, you're a girl.
[03:01:12.368 --> 03:01:13.989]  And I think you may be confused.
[03:01:14.409 --> 03:01:15.470]  Let me pray for you.
[03:01:15.750 --> 03:01:17.511]  That parent can go to jail for 10 years.
[03:01:19.269 --> 03:01:34.195]  And then the school can take the child and go and get them butchered up by these Nazi doctors that take pleasure in cutting children's breasts off and adding fake genitals to them.
[03:01:35.835 --> 03:01:44.639]  And the school can do that on behalf of the parent while the parent rots in prison for trying to save their child from genital mutilation.
[03:01:45.799 --> 03:01:48.000]  That's already a law in Australia.
[03:01:49.981 --> 03:01:58.146]  So when they're talking about, you know, you don't really have a right to religious expression.
[03:01:58.166 --> 03:02:02.069]  You have a right to believe what you want, but you don't really have a right to express it.
[03:02:03.410 --> 03:02:22.506]   But when we have Pride Month, an entire month of displaying This depravity, standing on floats and whipping each other in front of children half naked, teaching them about BDSM and men in their underwear twerking in front of women, old men with saggy underwear.
[03:02:22.546 --> 03:02:24.367]  You all know the clip I'm talking about.
[03:02:24.427 --> 03:02:24.987]  That's okay.
[03:02:25.027 --> 03:02:28.388]  That freedom of expression is perfectly okay.
[03:02:29.329 --> 03:02:31.270]  The state doesn't intervene in that.
[03:02:32.708 --> 03:02:46.975]  Alex aired a clip from Rob Primo contacting the Canadian police during Pride Month, and the police essentially said to him, and I interviewed Rob about this not long after, the police essentially said to him, yeah, look, you know, during Pride Month, we always kind of have this thing.
[03:02:47.455 --> 03:02:53.578]  Normally, sexual exploitation in front of children is not okay, but during Pride Month, it is what it is.
[03:02:54.038 --> 03:02:54.459]  Oh, well.
[03:02:56.179 --> 03:03:01.262]  Thanks to the police for protecting our children from pedophilia and grooming.
[03:03:03.925 --> 03:03:14.093]  So it then talks about how freedom of opinion and expression is enshrined, and it references a few articles here.
[03:03:14.614 --> 03:03:31.448]  I won't go into all the details, but it says, the provisions are given context by Article 20 of the Covenant, which prohibits racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.
[03:03:33.362 --> 03:03:46.412]  What we're talking about here is charging people or accusing them of inciting discrimination, hostility or violence and creating laws around it which limit religious freedoms.
[03:03:47.353 --> 03:03:54.119]  What does it mean to incite discrimination, hostility or violence?
[03:03:54.139 --> 03:04:09.390]   Well, an example here is that LG, it's saying That LGBT persons or the LGBT agenda is a threat to the traditional family or the nation is incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.
[03:04:11.632 --> 03:04:13.873]  So let me just be really logical here.
[03:04:15.094 --> 03:04:23.860]  If everyone was gay and we didn't preserve traditional family values, we wouldn't have natural reproduction anymore.
[03:04:25.001 --> 03:04:26.302]  That's not hateful.
[03:04:26.942 --> 03:04:27.883]  That's just fact.
[03:04:29.389 --> 03:04:34.272]  If we were all gay, the human race wouldn't survive very long.
[03:04:35.953 --> 03:04:40.637]  But they have a solution for that, though.
[03:04:40.657 --> 03:04:42.678]  They're going to give you lab-grown babies.
[03:04:42.698 --> 03:04:58.949]  Either way, you're not allowed to say it according to these people, and if you claim that there are religious reasons why you think that way, the state should limit that freedom of your expression because it incites hatred and violence.
[03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:03.162]  I'm going to go into what they actually constitute as hate speech in a moment.
[03:05:04.042 --> 03:05:20.952]  They say that the extent to which religion can be invoked for autocratic practices and denial of basic rights and civil liberties is also evident in some of the state legislatures seeking to enshrine anti-trans exclusion and eliminate comprehensive sex education in the United States.
[03:05:21.496 --> 03:05:25.397]  So he's actually, and he says that, you know, they're doing this for political purposes.
[03:05:25.437 --> 03:05:41.540]  So when a, when a normal person who realizes that pedophilia is not so good, uh, says, Hey, this book, this book is pornographic in nature and shouldn't be viewed by children.
[03:05:41.780 --> 03:05:45.061]  We had this recently in Australia with a book called Welcome to Sex.
[03:05:45.121 --> 03:05:48.782]  It got pulled off the shelves of a major retailer after public backlash.
[03:05:49.821 --> 03:05:55.303]  And one of the authors said, I'd be perfectly comfortable with a mature eight-year-old viewing this book.
[03:05:56.423 --> 03:06:04.985]  And the book had explicit details on how to perform sexual acts, such as rimming and scissoring.
[03:06:05.625 --> 03:06:07.046]  I don't even want to go into it for you.
[03:06:07.086 --> 03:06:10.687]  It's too disgusting for even adults to talk about on air.
[03:06:10.987 --> 03:06:15.128]  But one of the authors said, yeah, a mature eight-year-old could view this.
[03:06:15.408 --> 03:06:18.989]  So that's perfectly OK, says the United Nations.
[03:06:23.331 --> 03:06:39.021]  And they're using the example of people eliminating what they call comprehensive sex education, which is porn, being given to children as an example of this hatred, violence, incitement to violence.
[03:06:39.982 --> 03:06:49.268]  And how dare they use religious values to encourage children to not be shown porn by mentally deranged teachers.
[03:06:51.035 --> 03:06:55.419]  So I want to focus on what the UN considers incitement to discrimination.
[03:06:55.439 --> 03:06:57.301]  Okay.
[03:06:59.703 --> 03:07:12.314]  From the United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech report from May 2019, Antonio Guterres says, hate speech is a menace to democratic values, social stability and peace.
[03:07:13.135 --> 03:07:17.459]  As a matter of principle, the United Nations must confront hate speech at every turn.
[03:07:18.160 --> 03:07:26.085]  Silence can signal indifference to bigotry and intolerance, even as a situation escalates and the vulnerable become victims.
[03:07:26.145 --> 03:07:37.372]  So, really, you know, hate speech is such a menace and it can incite violence and, you know, it's something that we really care about and we want to eliminate hate speech and so on and so forth.
[03:07:37.392 --> 03:07:40.393]  This is Guterres, you know, he cares so much about humanity.
[03:07:40.914 --> 03:07:42.815]  On page two, what is hate speech?
[03:07:43.522 --> 03:07:51.589]  There is no international legal definition of hate speech and the characterization of what is hateful is controversial and disputed.
[03:07:54.152 --> 03:07:56.233]  Guys, we need to eliminate hate speech.
[03:07:56.574 --> 03:07:59.376]  But there's no definition for hate speech.
[03:08:00.897 --> 03:08:06.382]  It's just whatever hurts the feelings of the pedophiles.
[03:08:09.405 --> 03:08:10.206]  That's what it is.
[03:08:11.826 --> 03:08:27.226]  And it actually says, any kind of communication in speech, writing or behaviour that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or group on the basis of who they are.
[03:08:28.985 --> 03:08:43.432]  If you don't agree with someone and you use pejorative language, which simply means to express contempt or disapproval, that's hate speech and constitutes incitement to violence, incitement to discrimination.
[03:08:44.673 --> 03:08:55.731]   There is no protection of religious speech in the same manner when people go around mocking My Lord Jesus, there's no one stopping that, are they?
[03:08:56.091 --> 03:09:00.954]  No one's saying that's incitement to religious hatred and potential acts of violence.
[03:09:02.275 --> 03:09:11.921]  No, but if I use language that expresses my disapproval of pedophilia, I am inciting discrimination towards MAPS.
[03:09:12.822 --> 03:09:13.522]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:09:13.822 --> 03:09:16.404]  We'll continue and finish this report on the other side of this break.
[03:09:17.375 --> 03:09:39.794]  Before I read you some of the conclusions of this report, I just want to note what they call other forms of oppression and they give an example of how a Russian law in 2013 that banned propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations to minors is an example of censorship legislation that limits freedom of expression about LGBT topics.
[03:09:40.774 --> 03:09:44.036]  And is reliant upon protection of religiously derived traditional values.
[03:09:44.076 --> 03:09:46.238]  So they're saying that this is oppression.
[03:09:46.758 --> 03:09:51.321]  Not teaching children about gay sex is oppression.
[03:09:52.362 --> 03:10:00.407]  Because that, and that's an example of how religious institutions are oppressing gay people because they're not teaching children about gay sex.
[03:10:01.848 --> 03:10:03.089]  Or pedophile sex.
[03:10:04.050 --> 03:10:07.132]  This is what these people mean by this language.
[03:10:08.504 --> 03:10:09.504]  They want your children!
[03:10:09.804 --> 03:10:11.545]  They want your children!
[03:10:11.565 --> 03:10:12.905]  I'm going to prove it to you in a moment.
[03:10:13.926 --> 03:10:52.900]   Very quickly, the recommendations that this independent expert has made is to carry out necessary analysis and reform to ensure that legislation and public policy complies with the human rights standards, including these principles of non-discrimination, making sure we can keep teaching kids about gay sex, Ensuring that any law or public policy relating to the frameworks of religious exemptions or conscientious objection is compatible with human rights standards and does not negate the access of LGBT and other gender diverse persons.
[03:10:54.969 --> 03:11:03.936]  So making sure that there are no public policies or laws that allow religious people to say, we don't think that this is correct.
[03:11:04.016 --> 03:11:06.258]  We don't think that pedophilia is correct.
[03:11:06.558 --> 03:11:08.880]  We base that belief on our religious values.
[03:11:08.940 --> 03:11:09.400]  No, no, no.
[03:11:09.801 --> 03:11:14.945]  We need to change laws and public policies to make sure that we legalize pedophilia.
[03:11:16.380 --> 03:11:18.722]  This is what the goal is, the ultimate goal.
[03:11:19.723 --> 03:11:21.264]  As I said, I'm going to prove it to you in a moment.
[03:11:21.584 --> 03:11:25.627]  Team, if you can queue up the 8 March principles, we'll look at that in one second.
[03:11:26.908 --> 03:11:38.877]  Ensure the bodily autonomy and sexual and reproductive health and rights of LGBT and gender diverse persons, as well as comprehensive sexuality and gender education.
[03:11:41.058 --> 03:11:42.880]  They're talking about children here.
[03:11:44.292 --> 03:11:48.394]  Comprehensive sexuality and gender education.
[03:11:50.335 --> 03:12:05.102]  Working in collaboration with feminists, which the modern-day feminist movement is full of wackos, absolute loose cannons, mentally unstable victim mentality women who are seriously an embarrassment to women.
[03:12:05.122 --> 03:12:06.683]  You don't see any of them standing up.
[03:12:07.223 --> 03:12:12.866]  They'll go and scream in the streets for the rights to murder their child and do it repeatedly.
[03:12:13.553 --> 03:12:17.396]  But they won't scream in the streets to stop men from competing in women's sports.
[03:12:17.876 --> 03:12:19.217]  You should be ashamed of yourselves.
[03:12:20.838 --> 03:12:30.585]  Working in collaboration with feminists and LGBT-led and LGBT-serving civil society, including religious groups who work on an inclusive basis.
[03:12:30.645 --> 03:12:41.753]  So, working only with religious groups to push out our propaganda, which is the ultimate goal, is to be able to have sex with children, working with religious groups that are going to help us push that.
[03:12:41.793 --> 03:12:42.994]  That's what they're saying here.
[03:12:44.693 --> 03:12:48.356]  They're not going to work with all religious groups to try and engage them.
[03:12:48.376 --> 03:12:49.177]  No, no, no.
[03:12:49.217 --> 03:12:56.544]  We're going to push the ones who agree with this and will help us push this message out and criminalize anyone else who doesn't agree.
[03:12:59.687 --> 03:13:05.252]  They're saying that you need to refrain from justifying with religious narratives.
[03:13:05.922 --> 03:13:16.276]  They're telling religious leaders they have to refrain from justifying with religious narratives any act of violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
[03:13:16.657 --> 03:13:20.802]  Again, what they're talking about here, when they say violence, it's disapproval.
[03:13:21.744 --> 03:13:22.545]  That's what they're saying.
[03:13:23.669 --> 03:13:27.590]  And they actually say that faith-based leaders have to condemn this.
[03:13:27.930 --> 03:13:44.893]  They have to condemn any type of disapproval towards LGBT people and examine the historical role of how religious institutions have contributed to the perpetration of human rights violations.
[03:13:44.973 --> 03:13:47.274]  I'm going to show you the 8 March principles right now.
[03:13:47.990 --> 03:13:58.437]  This is a report that was published by the International Commission of Jurists, Advocates for Justice and Human Rights, with support of the United Nations.
[03:13:59.297 --> 03:14:01.518]  And in Principle 18, it says this.
[03:14:02.719 --> 03:14:06.962]  Sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.
[03:14:08.363 --> 03:14:11.865]  It says here that no one may be held criminally liable.
[03:14:11.905 --> 03:14:16.848]  This is page 27 of the PDF, guys, so that you can bring it up for everyone.
[03:14:17.580 --> 03:14:18.661]  Principle 18.
[03:14:19.161 --> 03:14:26.384]  No one may be held criminally liable for conduct or status based on their gender identity or gender expression.
[03:14:26.424 --> 03:14:27.645]  What does that actually mean?
[03:14:28.145 --> 03:14:54.478]   In their terms, the decoded language here is, no one can be held criminally liable for their conduct based on their gender expression, which is, to them, Gender identities and forms of gender expression that are perceived not to conform to societal expectations or norms relating to gender roles, the sex assigned to a person at birth or a male-female binary among others.
[03:14:54.538 --> 03:14:55.178]  What are the others?
[03:14:55.619 --> 03:14:56.499]  That is pedophiles.
[03:14:57.199 --> 03:15:00.640]  So they're saying no one may be held criminally liable.
[03:15:01.520 --> 03:15:07.802]  The decoded language here is if they have sex with minors because this is their sexual expression.
[03:15:08.983 --> 03:15:25.260]   They go on to say No one may be held criminally liable for consensual practices aiming to assist others with the exploration, pre-development and or affirmation of sexual orientation or gender identity unless there was forced coercion, fraud or medical negligence.
[03:15:25.380 --> 03:15:28.001]  So, what do they say here?
[03:15:28.701 --> 03:15:34.964]  They're saying no one can be held criminally liable, this is what they're advocating for, for consensual practices.
[03:15:37.853 --> 03:15:44.915]  So what is the consensual practice?
[03:15:44.935 --> 03:15:47.555]  I've gone to Principle 18.
[03:15:47.735 --> 03:15:52.336]  Tim, can you go up to Principle 16, which is consensual sexual conduct?
[03:15:53.917 --> 03:16:09.650]   They say that consensual sexual conduct, irrespective of the type of sexual activity, The sex, gender, sexual orientation, meaning pedophile, gender identity and gender expression of the people involved or their marital status may not be criminalized in any circumstances.
[03:16:10.892 --> 03:16:11.273]  Okay.
[03:16:11.814 --> 03:16:13.016]  Consensual same sex.
[03:16:15.842 --> 03:16:19.645]  And they go on to talk about all these sorts of things outside of marriage, so on and so forth.
[03:16:19.685 --> 03:16:20.185]  But look at this.
[03:16:20.846 --> 03:16:32.294]  Moreover, sexual conduct involving persons below the domestically prescribed minimum age of consent to sex may be consensual in fact if not in law.
[03:16:33.121 --> 03:16:49.857]  In this context, the enforcement of criminal law should reflect the rights and capacity of persons under 18 years of age to make decisions about engaging in consensual sexual conduct and their right to be heard in matters concerning them.
[03:16:51.135 --> 03:17:02.661]  Pursuant to their evolving capacities and progressive autonomy, persons under 18 years of age should participate in decisions affecting them with due regard to their age, maturity and best interests, so on and so forth.
[03:17:02.681 --> 03:17:06.522]  So people, we come down to the crux of the issue.
[03:17:07.123 --> 03:17:27.477]   You have the United Nations coming and saying you cannot discriminate and you cannot use, as a religious person, pejorative language to defend Your right to traditional values, to stand against pedophilia, you can't do that anymore.
[03:17:27.537 --> 03:17:47.260]   And moreover, according to the 8 March Principles, the International Commission of Jurists, people under the age of 18 can consent to sex, any forms of sex, With anyone of any age, it doesn't give an age limit here.
[03:17:47.300 --> 03:17:49.842]  It doesn't say, you know, 12 to 18.
[03:17:50.162 --> 03:17:52.564]  Not that I'm saying that 12 is okay either.
[03:17:52.965 --> 03:17:55.226]  I'm just saying, it's saying anyone.
[03:17:55.246 --> 03:18:09.158]  So when you have freaks, like the guy who started the transgender movement, who used to rape babies, saying that because they're flashed in the face, that's a sign of consent.
[03:18:10.359 --> 03:18:11.740]  This is where we're heading, people.
[03:18:12.634 --> 03:18:15.077]  The answer is that we need to exit the United Nations.
[03:18:15.117 --> 03:18:18.261]  We've had some huge, huge wins recently.
[03:18:18.301 --> 03:18:24.128]  We have the local mainstream media in Florida talking about the fact that these shots are a bioweapon.
[03:18:24.468 --> 03:18:30.275]  We've got the British Rowing Society banning males from competing in women's sports.
[03:18:31.252 --> 03:18:36.415]  We have a lot of good winds coming up all over the world.
[03:18:36.455 --> 03:18:43.418]  We've had major winds in Australia pushing back on some of these laws that seek to stop us from using our own land.
[03:18:45.539 --> 03:18:56.465]  People are waking up, people are rising up, and the one thing that people need to wake up to today, today, is that we must exit the United Nations.
[03:18:56.505 --> 03:19:02.067]   You want to know where this push To sexualize your children comes from?
[03:19:02.988 --> 03:19:07.371]  With the ultimate goal of being able to legally have sex with your children?
[03:19:09.152 --> 03:19:20.860]  Look, no further than the puppet masters who run the United Nations, but as a bare minimum, call for the exit of the United Nations.
[03:19:20.920 --> 03:19:23.362]  These people are advocating for pedophilia.
[03:19:23.682 --> 03:19:26.244]  They are seeking to exterminate religion.
[03:19:27.023 --> 03:19:28.844]  And it is because they serve Satan.
[03:19:28.904 --> 03:19:35.346]  So on the final note, where they say that speaking the truth is an act of war, well let's do war, baby!
[03:19:35.466 --> 03:19:40.648]  Jesus Christ is Lord and there is nothing that will ever, ever stop me from saying that.
[03:19:40.688 --> 03:19:41.649]  You best believe it.
[03:19:41.989 --> 03:19:43.129]  The truth is the truth.
[03:19:43.489 --> 03:19:44.270]  You are liars!
[03:19:44.290 --> 03:19:46.350]  And that's the end of that.
[03:19:46.390 --> 03:19:47.051]  God bless you all.
[03:19:47.091 --> 03:19:47.831]  Thank you so much.
[03:19:47.911 --> 03:19:49.412]  I'm Maria Zee from Zee Media.

[03:21:40.144 --> 03:21:41.585]  So 10% off is gargantuan.
[03:21:41.885 --> 03:21:43.126]  The highest rated water filters.
[03:21:43.226 --> 03:21:44.228]  Highest rated air filters.
[03:21:44.769 --> 03:21:50.197]  Already, on average, half what the leading competitors are that are the same unit.
[03:21:50.497 --> 03:21:51.980]  10% off of that, you cannot beat it.
[03:21:52.280 --> 03:21:53.522]  That's got to end in a couple days.
[03:21:53.562 --> 03:21:56.146]  The rest of the sale will continue on through the month.
[03:21:56.166 --> 03:21:58.029]  You can also just make a straight donation.
[03:21:59.116 --> 03:22:02.379]  Or it says donate at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:22:02.399 --> 03:22:02.379]  $5, $10, $100, $1,000.
[03:22:02.719 --> 03:22:04.861]  You can sign up to do it recurring.
[03:22:05.402 --> 03:22:06.603]  Cancel for free anytime.
[03:22:06.883 --> 03:22:09.186]  But say, hey, I want to donate $10 every month to InfoWars.
[03:22:09.506 --> 03:22:15.832]  That would be getting 95% of the money after credit card fees instead of, you know, the food or water filter.
[03:22:16.312 --> 03:22:19.175]  With a discount of 10%, we're making 20% on it, OK?
[03:22:19.836 --> 03:22:20.176]  It's fine.
[03:22:20.216 --> 03:22:21.017]  We sell a ton of it.
[03:22:21.037 --> 03:22:21.777]  We give you the best deal.
[03:22:22.924 --> 03:22:25.985]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:22:26.005 --> 03:22:26.346]  888-253-3139.
[03:22:26.426 --> 03:22:33.028]  Colloidal Silver.
[03:22:33.068 --> 03:22:34.049]  Sold out in three years.
[03:22:34.289 --> 03:22:35.169]  Top lab in the country.
[03:22:35.189 --> 03:22:35.830]  We're a private label.
[03:22:35.870 --> 03:22:38.651]  It's so good to have your medicine cabinet topically, internally.
[03:22:38.791 --> 03:22:39.611]  It's just incredible.
[03:22:40.232 --> 03:22:41.352]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:22:41.552 --> 03:22:42.132]  It's 30% off.
[03:22:43.792 --> 03:22:47.893]  So take action now for the incredible coverage you just saw the last hour.
[03:22:48.293 --> 03:22:51.054]  You're financing saving the children's future.
[03:22:51.274 --> 03:22:53.295]  You're financing exposing the next lockdown.
[03:22:53.675 --> 03:22:55.736]  Stopping the globalist program in deadest tracks.
[03:22:55.976 --> 03:23:01.657]  The enemy admits in their own documents that have leaked that they see us as the talking point generator everybody's following.
[03:23:01.817 --> 03:23:02.558]  It's actually true.
[03:23:02.858 --> 03:23:03.418]  Not bragging.
[03:23:03.458 --> 03:23:04.358]  God put me in this position.
[03:23:04.698 --> 03:23:05.278]  It's not just me.
[03:23:05.338 --> 03:23:06.459]  It's our guests, our callers.
[03:23:06.499 --> 03:23:07.159]  It's what we do.
[03:23:07.479 --> 03:23:09.200]  We are the best there is.
[03:23:09.460 --> 03:23:10.200]  All of us together.
[03:23:10.600 --> 03:23:13.710]  Please pray for us, spread the word, and go now to mfullerstore.com.
[03:23:13.549 --> 03:23:14.049]  Go now.
[03:23:14.049 --> 03:23:20.549]  [silence]
[03:23:20.549 --> 03:23:23.549]  Biological attack is imminent!
[03:23:24.010 --> 03:23:24.371]  Imminent!
[03:23:24.651 --> 03:23:25.491]  It's going to happen.
[03:23:25.732 --> 03:23:29.054]  It's not a question of will it happen, but when it happens.
[03:23:29.534 --> 03:23:40.983]  A bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a global problem, and the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[03:23:41.063 --> 03:23:47.548]  This is a biological warfare agent that had leaked out of the Wuhan laboratory.
