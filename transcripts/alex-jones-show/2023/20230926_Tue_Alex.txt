[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.789]  Global exclusive, Biden administration orders American Airlines to reinstate contact tracing.
[00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:19.964]  Now, if you go into the order that Biden put in in 2021, for anybody, including citizens coming in the U.S., having to contact trace, you will see that it was never rescinded.
[00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:25.646]  But going back about a year ago, major airlines stopped doing it.
[00:00:26.386 --> 00:00:27.287]  We've done the research.
[00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:36.851]  So American Airlines and others, the documents we have on InfoWars.com are from American Airlines, stopped doing the contact tracing, even though it was an order about a year ago.
[00:00:37.831 --> 00:01:26.515]   And I've been out of the country in the last year and back in and there was no contact tracing but now the reports are pouring in now it's confirmed and it's back on the American Airlines site it's on a lot of the other airline sites that they have re-implemented under the CDC directive the contact tracing and that ties into quarantining that that ties into investigators coming to your house that that that ties into them if they want grabbing you and putting you in one of these giant COVID centers that they've built that they've got at the ready and the first place that did this was Italy and then France and then Australia and New Zealand during the whole Scandemic pandemic people that were criticizing the lockdowns people that weren't going along with the lockdowns Who didn't quote even test positive with their fake PCR souped-up tests were almost everybody's positive they were
[00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:29.698]  Locked up in these facilities.
[00:01:29.738 --> 00:01:34.824]  And so now Canada's saying they're going to lock people up in these facilities as well during the next pandemic or plandemic.
[00:01:34.864 --> 00:01:36.306]  So this is a big, big deal.
[00:01:36.706 --> 00:01:43.494]  And it goes with the information we got five weeks ago that by the middle of September, they would begin rolling this out, intensifying it into October.
[00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:52.101]  So again, as our whistleblowers told us back five weeks ago, they would begin rolling the measures that they rolled out a few years ago.
[00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:59.207]  They would relaunch them starting in the middle of September, intensifying in October, November and December of this year in the next year in the election.
[00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:03.971]  Due to massive, massive pushback, though, they may not be able to get it all implemented.
[00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:04.571]  Thank God.
[00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.772]  I mean, it really is up to us.
[00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:10.051]   we'd still be under a lockdown if people around the world hadn't have said no.
[00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:19.651]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:20.992]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:27.325]  It's Tuesday, September 26, 2023.
[00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:30.627]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:33.347]  We've got a very full plate today.
[00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:47.232]  Well, Senator Ted Cruz and a bunch of other leading Republicans that have got a lot of inside sources are saying that Michelle Obama is going to be the one to replace Joe Biden as the nominee.
[00:02:47.772 --> 00:02:51.213]  They've changed all the rules so that basically no other candidates can run.
[00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:53.654]  There won't be any other Democrat debates.
[00:02:54.114 --> 00:02:56.616]  They're blocking Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:02:56.796 --> 00:02:58.176]  out of the primaries.
[00:02:58.236 --> 00:03:04.940]  They've set up rules where he's not allowed to campaign in the key primary states, the first states, or he then can't be on the ballot.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.621]  I mean, it is just wild.
[00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:12.745]  They are completely opening the door using party rules that they've never fully implemented.
[00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:17.569]  They did it partially with Bernie Sanders, it's still a nomination from him, but now they're publicly doing it.
[00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:27.077]  So they're not just fixing elections against Republicans, they're fixing their own party's elections in front of the world, creating a uniparty system.
[00:03:27.818 --> 00:03:45.091]   And with the censorship, And with the surveillance and with the debanking and with the controls going in, not just here, but all over the Western world, they're trying to lock up and dial in and put into concrete this totalitarian takeover.
[00:03:45.111 --> 00:03:46.852]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:52.036]  Roger Stone will be joining us because he was the first person to start saying this really two and a half years ago.
[00:03:52.077 --> 00:03:55.319]  He's been sure of it for a year and it looks like he's right.
[00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.381]  And it's a total, total gimmick.
[00:03:58.408 --> 00:04:01.394]  Oh, it's a black woman, so everything will get fixed now.
[00:04:01.434 --> 00:04:04.420]  And it won't be black people that vote for her in any higher numbers.
[00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:06.865]  Actually, we see record numbers say they're going to vote Trump.
[00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:07.727]  It's going to be white.
[00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:12.988]  Women that think it's trendy and cool and avant-garde.
[00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:20.355]  It's gonna be the white boomers and Gen Xers that think this is just magical.
[00:04:21.335 --> 00:04:29.242]  And we'll probably have nuclear war, but it's okay because we'll all burn up in nuclear fire, thermonuclear fire with a black woman at the helm.
[00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:35.795]   As for Michelle being Big Mike, I don't know if Michelle Obama is a man or a woman.
[00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:45.800]  I know Joan Rivers said that she was a man posing as a woman, quote, training, and then Joan Rivers died a few months later in a very bizarre circumstance.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:05:01.308]  And I do know there's videos of them taking their daughters to college, coming out of the enrollment center or the dorm, and there is what looks like a large flaccid penis, looks about six inches long, bouncing around.
[00:05:02.228 --> 00:05:03.409]  They do psyops, folks.
[00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:06.171]  They do weird things to mess with us.
[00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:07.032]  But it's happened a bunch.
[00:05:07.553 --> 00:05:08.713]  There's not just that one video.
[00:05:08.734 --> 00:05:10.095]  There's five or six videos.
[00:05:11.176 --> 00:05:19.402]  We've also got the different times that Obama said, Michael and I, talking about his wife.
[00:05:19.502 --> 00:05:22.205]  I mean, I've never called my wife Eric.
[00:05:23.105 --> 00:05:28.010]   Her name's You know, whatever, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:31.911]  This is the level of things that are going on.
[00:05:32.191 --> 00:05:44.314]  And quite frankly, at the end of the day, I think that there's a lot of evidence that Joel Gilbert and many other people have put on that indeed, Big Mike is a man.
[00:05:45.134 --> 00:05:48.015]  And there's all the photos of them back in college and the rest of it.
[00:05:48.275 --> 00:05:49.975]  And I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:05:50.195 --> 00:05:52.956]  It just does not look like a woman.
[00:05:53.636 --> 00:06:00.100]  And obviously it looks like Big Mike's had some surgeries, whether Big Mike is a man or a woman.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.161]  There's definitely been some plastic surgery going on.
[00:06:03.221 --> 00:06:04.682]  So I said I'd cover it.
[00:06:04.702 --> 00:06:08.964]  We're going to be breaking it down in the second hour with Roger Stone.
[00:06:09.264 --> 00:06:13.264]  He doesn't go there, whether Big Mike is a man or a woman.
[00:06:13.264 --> 00:06:17.584]   We're going to look at the policies and the mindset and who is Big Mike, who's never been
[00:06:17.584 --> 00:06:22.244]   in politics other than being the first lady or the first whatever it is.
[00:06:22.244 --> 00:06:24.903]  So we've got that coming up.
[00:06:24.903 --> 00:06:30.184]   We've got big developments on the Nazi getting the standing ovation, the actual SS storm
[00:06:30.184 --> 00:06:35.924]   trooper that his unit was heavily involved in actual Holocaust mass murder, killing people
[00:06:35.924 --> 00:06:39.364]   and shoveling them into mass graves, bulldozing them into mass graves.
[00:06:39.407 --> 00:06:40.167]  Can't make that up.
[00:06:40.187 --> 00:06:41.207]  We've got big developments.
[00:06:41.227 --> 00:06:43.047]  Trudeau says that's Russian propaganda.
[00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:46.268]  I mean, if you slip on a banana peel, it's the Russians.
[00:06:46.288 --> 00:06:48.228]  Or if you don't like inflation, it's the Russians.
[00:06:48.268 --> 00:06:49.629]  Or if you don't like open borders, it's the Russians.
[00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:54.050]  Or if you don't like drag queen Storytime trying to cut your son's genitals off, it's the Russians.
[00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:55.410]  Everything's the Russians.
[00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.130]  So we've got that.
[00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.171]  We've got big Trump news.
[00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:00.412]  We've just got so much massive news today.
[00:07:00.812 --> 00:07:01.913]  Tell everybody, you know, tune in now.
[00:07:01.933 --> 00:07:03.614]  That's how we override the censors.
[00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:05.135]  And we're doing a pretty good job.
[00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:06.556]  That means you, the listeners and viewers, are.
[00:07:06.576 --> 00:07:07.316]  So I salute you.
[00:07:08.017 --> 00:07:09.618]  We've got other big guests today as well.
[00:07:09.978 --> 00:07:10.998]  Of course, the great Owen Schroer.
[00:07:11.018 --> 00:07:12.179]  I'll be back in the studio tomorrow.
[00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:12.980]  Stay with us.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.681]  I've got a lot of news we're going to break down on the other side.
[00:07:14.821 --> 00:07:15.821]  Infowars.com.
[00:07:15.861 --> 00:07:16.562]  Band on video.
[00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:19.300]  It's Tuesday, September 26, 2023.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.222]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:07:23.203 --> 00:07:27.786]  And we've got big breaking news coming up in the second hour with Roger Stone.
[00:07:27.806 --> 00:07:39.674]  He was the first to say it two and a half years ago, right when Biden first stole the election, that they were going to replace him before the next presidential election with Michelle Obama, aka Big Mike.
[00:07:40.353 --> 00:07:46.112]   So we'll be doing the deep dive on who's behind Big Mike and what the mindset is of Big Mike
[00:07:46.112 --> 00:07:51.293]   and how Big Mike will measure up against Trump coming up in the election, because it's now
[00:07:51.293 --> 00:07:55.353]   being said by the top Republicans across the board and major Democrats, they're preparing
[00:07:55.353 --> 00:08:02.753]   to replace Big Mike and then the, or they're preparing to replace Biden with Big Mike.
[00:08:02.753 --> 00:08:07.392]   And then they're also getting Gavin Newsom ready for the VP or maybe even leaving Kamala
[00:08:07.392 --> 00:08:08.733]  in as the VP.
[00:08:08.733 --> 00:08:13.152]   So we'll have the gimmick of twin women as the president and vice president.
[00:08:13.152 --> 00:08:16.634]  They love gimmicks as America burns the ground in tyranny.
[00:08:16.634 --> 00:08:20.072]   Don't worry though, we've got two women of color running things, so you can't criticize
[00:08:20.072 --> 00:08:21.752]  it or you're racist.
[00:08:21.752 --> 00:08:24.153]  So that's all coming up.
[00:08:24.178 --> 00:08:30.984]  There's so much other big news we're breaking down, but the first thing I want to hit is a story that's up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:08:31.404 --> 00:08:38.070]  Global exclusive, Biden administration orders American Airlines to reinstate contact tracing.
[00:08:39.656 --> 00:08:51.265]  Now, if you go into the order that Biden put in, in 2021, for anybody, including citizens coming in the U.S., having to contact trace, you will see that it was never rescinded.
[00:08:52.106 --> 00:08:56.950]  But going back about a year ago, major airlines stopped doing it.
[00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:58.591]  We've done the research.
[00:08:59.031 --> 00:09:08.158]  So American Airlines and others, the documents we have on InfoWars.com are from American Airlines, stopped doing the contact tracing, even though it was an order about a year ago.
[00:09:09.136 --> 00:09:13.358]  And I've been out of the country in the last year and back in, and there was no contact tracing.
[00:09:13.699 --> 00:09:15.160]  But now the reports are pouring in.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.060]  Now it's confirmed.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.981]  It's back on the American Airlines site.
[00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:25.686]  It's on a lot of the other airline sites that they have re-implemented under the CDC directive, the contact tracing.
[00:09:25.726 --> 00:09:27.707]  And that ties into quarantining.
[00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:30.128]  That ties into investigators coming to your house.
[00:09:30.689 --> 00:09:57.829]   That ties into them, if they want, grabbing you and putting you in one of these giant Covid centers that they've built that they've got at the ready and the first place that did this was Italy and then France and then Australia and New Zealand during the whole Scandemic pandemic people that were criticizing the lockdowns people that weren't going along with the lockdowns Who didn't quote even test positive with their fake PCR souped-up tests were almost everybody's positive they were
[00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.993]  Locked up in these facilities.
[00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:06.119]  And so now Canada's saying they're going to lock people up in these facilities as well during the next pandemic or plandemic.
[00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:07.601]  So this is a big, big deal.
[00:10:08.002 --> 00:10:14.791]  And it goes with the information we got five weeks ago that by the middle of September they would begin rolling this out, intensifying it into October.
[00:10:15.752 --> 00:10:23.399]  So again, as our whistleblowers told us back five weeks ago, they would begin rolling the measures that they rolled out a few years ago.
[00:10:23.699 --> 00:10:30.505]  They would relaunch them starting the middle of September, intensifying in October, November and December of this year in the next year in the election.
[00:10:30.966 --> 00:10:35.250]  Due to massive, massive pushback, though, they may not be able to get it all implemented.
[00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:35.850]  Thank God.
[00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.071]  I mean, it really is up to us.
[00:10:37.392 --> 00:10:40.955]  We'd still be under a lockdown if people around the world hadn't have said no.
[00:10:42.096 --> 00:10:45.576]   Now it's important to understand this was really just a climate lockdown.
[00:10:45.576 --> 00:10:50.735]   In other words, the WEF, the IMF, the World Bank and the UN, and now again, they're just
[00:10:50.735 --> 00:10:55.056]   cutting off the energy so that most people can't afford the gas regardless.
[00:10:55.056 --> 00:10:59.015]   So whether you like it or not, you are under the beginning of a climate lockdown.
[00:10:59.015 --> 00:11:02.536]  But they officially admit that that is their plan.
[00:11:03.094 --> 00:11:06.276]  So that story is up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:11:06.296 --> 00:11:07.857]  It needs to go super viral.
[00:11:08.137 --> 00:11:10.038]  We're going to get ahead of this and stop it together.
[00:11:10.059 --> 00:11:12.060]  You've been doing a great job sharing the articles and videos.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.023]  You've been doing an amazing job taking clips out and posting them all over the web.
[00:11:16.363 --> 00:11:19.005]  Keep it up, ladies and gentlemen, because again, look in the mirror.
[00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:20.646]  You are the modern Paul Reveres.
[00:11:21.026 --> 00:11:22.207]  You are the resistance.
[00:11:22.527 --> 00:11:24.588]  You are the answer to 1984 tyranny.
[00:11:24.849 --> 00:11:25.869]  You are the spirit of 1776.
[00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:37.979]  Now let's shift gears to the World War III front that's rapidly expanding as Ukraine loses the war as NATO loses the war against the Russians.
[00:11:38.059 --> 00:11:50.088]  NATO is only doubling down with F-16s, hypersonic heavy cruise missiles, and of course, Abrams tanks, all being delivered or set to be delivered in the next few weeks.
[00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:51.730]  Meanwhile, the U.S.
[00:11:51.770 --> 00:12:21.403]   government, massively in debt to the Black Rock Rothschild crime syndicate, has announced via the Pentagon that the Pentagon is not going to cut any of the war funding or any of the salaries or any of the incredible infrastructure projects that are being set up in Ukraine, that again our criminal ruling class is also laundering a large slice off the top for themselves, skimming a large portion off to themselves.
[00:12:21.863 --> 00:12:23.364]  And here's a headline from Zero Hedge.
[00:12:23.384 --> 00:12:24.906]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:25.426 --> 00:12:25.786]  U.S.
[00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:30.650]  to keep paying salaries for tens of thousands of Ukrainians during government shutdown.
[00:12:31.091 --> 00:12:38.937]  So your government is not essential and quite frankly commits so many crimes and is so parasitic it would probably be better if it didn't just shut down.
[00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:44.942]  But they're going to hold us hostage with that and essential services to people and welfare checks, you name it.
[00:12:44.962 --> 00:12:48.245]  I mean, this is a big deal for a lot of people that live hand to mouth.
[00:12:49.146 --> 00:12:54.249]   And now More and more of that money is being sent to Ukraine.
[00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:57.113]  This is really getting the American people's attention.
[00:12:57.173 --> 00:12:58.275]  It's really upsetting folks.
[00:12:58.816 --> 00:13:02.621]  And it shows how we're just a colony of the globalists that's being sucked dry.
[00:13:02.641 --> 00:13:03.743]  The U.S.
[00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:08.029]  to keep paying salaries for tens of thousands of Ukrainians during government shutdown.
[00:13:09.335 --> 00:13:16.284]  A newly aired 60-minute segment entitled, The Unexpected Way American Tax Dollars Are Being Used in Ukraine, has uncovered the U.S.
[00:13:16.324 --> 00:13:22.032]  government is paying the salaries of some 57,000 Ukrainian civic service personnel.
[00:13:22.433 --> 00:13:32.699]   And they've got a new civic Service Personnel Head in the Outreach to Children, and that's the most famous witch on Earth, Marina Abramovich, so can't make that up either.
[00:13:32.719 --> 00:13:39.642]  The only thing crazier would be if they gave standing ovations to SS commandos that helped carry out the actual Holocaust.
[00:13:39.782 --> 00:13:40.843]  Oop, they just did that too.
[00:13:41.323 --> 00:13:45.605]  The report details the various ways non-military aid is being spent.
[00:13:46.769 --> 00:13:51.609]   At a moment, GOP congressional leaders are intensely debating whether to move forward
[00:13:51.609 --> 00:13:56.009]   with a proposed defense budget that includes Biden's push for an additional $24 billion
[00:13:56.009 --> 00:14:01.609]   more in military assistance for Kiev, and of course also $25 billion from the IMF and
[00:14:01.609 --> 00:14:04.608]   World Bank to be given to the Clintons, who will then divvy that up.
[00:14:04.608 --> 00:14:05.730]  Remember, same thing with Soros.
[00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:06.730]  He never used his money.
[00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.968]  He got State Department money to run all this garbage.
[00:14:08.968 --> 00:14:12.608]   The overthrow of Ukraine, their government nine years ago, the starting of this proxy
[00:14:12.608 --> 00:14:15.769]  war that's leading to a full war, perhaps nuclear war.
[00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:19.168]  It's the same story over and over again.
[00:14:19.168 --> 00:14:24.970]   The U.S. spent just over $43 billion on military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded.
[00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.528]   That's equivalent to about 5% of the American defense budget.
[00:14:27.528 --> 00:14:30.848]   European countries combined have contributed around $30 billion.
[00:14:30.848 --> 00:14:35.250]   The 60 Minutes report narrates, and it's actually way, way, way, way, way, way worse than that.
[00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.610]  The U.S. has spent at least $150 billion.
[00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.168]   The number is well over $200 billion if you count all the numbers together.
[00:14:40.168 --> 00:14:42.689]  So again, this is a report on 60 Minutes.
[00:14:42.689 --> 00:14:43.689]  It's a whitewash.
[00:14:43.689 --> 00:14:50.928]   Now, let's shift gears into the real live 98-year-old Nazi getting the standing ovation
[00:14:50.928 --> 00:14:53.889]  and how they're trying to spin that now as Russian disinformation.
[00:14:53.889 --> 00:14:57.409]  By the way, if you get a toothache, it's the Russians.
[00:14:57.409 --> 00:14:59.329]  Or if you fall and skin your knee, it's the Russians.
[00:14:59.329 --> 00:15:02.689]  Or if you don't do your homework, don't say the dog ate it.
[00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:04.568]  Just say the Russians ate it.
[00:15:04.568 --> 00:15:06.089]  We're going to go to break in a few minutes.
[00:15:06.089 --> 00:15:11.649]   I'm going to come back and play some clips of Justin Trudeau, again, trying to spin that
[00:15:11.649 --> 00:15:17.450]   it's Russian disinformation and that people should just basically forget about what happened.
[00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:23.529]   But he's also very embarrassed for Canada because this happened.
[00:15:23.529 --> 00:15:26.370]  But this is part and parcel of...
[00:15:26.327 --> 00:15:32.198]  Of who runs the Ukrainian regime and who their main battle component is of soldiers.
[00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:35.364]  What the culture is in Ukraine.
[00:15:36.992 --> 00:15:39.494]  In the anti-Russian sentiment.
[00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:48.281]  So we're going to go to break and come back and just talk about those facts and give the latest developments of the biggest screw-up ever by these people.
[00:15:48.301 --> 00:15:51.223]  Because they know full well the main Ukrainian force is Nazi.
[00:15:51.944 --> 00:15:56.968]  And they know full well they've been meeting with a bunch of pro-Nazi Ukrainians and the government's full of them.
[00:15:57.008 --> 00:16:05.735]  But now, they went way too far and just legitimized what Putin and others have been saying, and what Cy Hirsch has been saying, and what I've been saying, that is the truth.
[00:16:05.934 --> 00:16:10.094]   that the Ukrainian military's dominant force, the majority of it, is Nazi.
[00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:21.574]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, "I don't know what's
[00:16:21.574 --> 00:16:24.014]  going to happen at the end of this, but you ought to fight!"
[00:16:24.248 --> 00:16:26.430]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:34.350]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:58.350]   If I were the devil, if I were the prince of deception, I'd want to shroud the world in unyielding darkness.
[00:16:58.812 --> 00:17:05.056]  I'd seize control over the lands and masses, but I wouldn't be satisfied until I had quashed the boldest voice of truth.
[00:17:05.496 --> 00:17:06.576]  Info Wars.
[00:17:06.897 --> 00:17:09.538]  So I'd work meticulously to control the world.
[00:17:09.999 --> 00:17:12.640]  I'd target platforms like Info Wars first.
[00:17:13.081 --> 00:17:14.862]  I'd initiate a campaign of silence.
[00:17:15.122 --> 00:17:22.326]   With the subtlety of a serpent, I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve, believe only what you're told.
[00:17:22.706 --> 00:17:27.629]  To the young I would whisper, InfoWars is a fake news conspiracy theory network.
[00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:34.473]  I would convince them that man needs no alternate perspectives, no dissenting voices, no questions against the status quo.
[00:17:34.913 --> 00:17:44.856]  I would assure them that InfoWars is false, and what's approved is true, and the old I would teach to say after me, our father which art in censorship.
[00:17:45.136 --> 00:17:56.560]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have people at war with InfoWars, platforms at war with free speech, and nations at war with freedom of thought, until each in its turn was uniform.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:08.526]  If I were the devil, I would undermine platforms like InfoWars from being a refuge for the inquisitive until before you knew it, you'd have suppression and censorship at every door.
[00:18:08.927 --> 00:18:11.568]  Soon, I'd have unity and misinformation.
[00:18:12.028 --> 00:18:15.050]  I'd have influential figures promoting a single narrative.
[00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:19.993]  Soon, I could evict InfoWars from social media, then from search engines.
[00:18:20.653 --> 00:18:26.198]  And then from the homes of patriots, I would lure society into believing only one perspective.
[00:18:26.218 --> 00:18:28.280]  Dismissing info wars as falsehood.
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.643]  And what do you bet I could get whole states to promote uniformity as progress?
[00:18:33.424 --> 00:18:36.707]  I would convince the young that independent platforms are outdated.
[00:18:37.007 --> 00:18:39.169]  That compliance is more comfortable.
[00:18:39.209 --> 00:18:42.652]  That what you see in the mainstream media is the only perspective.
[00:18:43.192 --> 00:18:50.839]  In other words, if I were the devil, I wouldn't want you to visit InfoWars.com forward slash show today.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:56.723]  If I were the devil, I'd keep doing everything I'm doing.
[00:18:57.624 --> 00:19:03.349]  Undermining society, turning people against each other, poisoning the food and water supply, taking over people's bodies.
[00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.932]  This truly is a satanic new world order.
[00:19:07.352 --> 00:19:10.115]  And I'm honored and blessed to be here with you in the fight against them.
[00:19:10.805 --> 00:19:13.888]  Now, what's really going on with this Nazi soldier?
[00:19:15.269 --> 00:19:25.118]  This is the cream of the cream, the top of the Nazi pyramid, as Ezra Levant, who's Jewish and has the biggest patriot media organization in Canada, said yesterday.
[00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:27.700]  And he pointed out that this was deliberate.
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:39.805]   They thought they'd get away with it because Trudeau has been over in Canada Openly honoring high-level members of the government that are admitted Nazis and that actually say that, oh, the Ukrainian Nazis were good.
[00:19:40.186 --> 00:19:41.747]  They never killed a single Jew.
[00:19:42.869 --> 00:19:49.435]  And it's been hands-off for the ADL, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and all the rest of these groups, because they're not after real Nazis.
[00:19:49.475 --> 00:19:54.040]  They would have grabbed George Soros and hauled him back to Israel and put him on trial.
[00:19:54.981 --> 00:19:57.983]  No, ladies and gentlemen, this guy is protected.
[00:19:58.083 --> 00:20:01.264]  And a ton of Nazis at the end of World War II didn't go to Argentina.
[00:20:01.845 --> 00:20:02.705]  They didn't go to Spain.
[00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:03.426]  A lot of them did.
[00:20:03.726 --> 00:20:05.367]  They went to Ukraine.
[00:20:05.987 --> 00:20:09.409]  The deputy prime minister's dad was a Nazi.
[00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:12.150]  She's also the deputy head of the WEF.
[00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.192]  Oh, just like Klaus Schwab's dad and grandfather were Nazis.
[00:20:15.412 --> 00:20:16.833]  Starting to figure it out?
[00:20:17.033 --> 00:20:18.433]  High-level Nazis.
[00:20:18.473 --> 00:20:22.656]  His grandfather was the head of the third largest weapons manufacturer.
[00:20:23.656 --> 00:20:25.978]  So, they thought they'd get away with this.
[00:20:25.998 --> 00:20:27.299]  They thought the public was stupid.
[00:20:27.899 --> 00:20:30.961]  They thought they'd sell that, oh, you know, the Russians were bad in World War II.
[00:20:31.282 --> 00:20:34.784]  Well, I'm not saying the Communists were good, but we were on their side in World War II.
[00:20:35.685 --> 00:20:37.086]  The Parliament's not that dumb.
[00:20:37.726 --> 00:20:41.389]  So, this was a psy-op, ladies and gentlemen, but it blew up in their face.
[00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:43.530]  Now, let's go to Trudeau.
[00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:45.312]  Listen to him.
[00:20:45.552 --> 00:20:46.813]  Listen to him carefully.
[00:20:48.399 --> 00:20:50.841]  He sits there and says, oh, the Canadian people are ashamed.
[00:20:51.162 --> 00:20:58.488]  He wants to make you ashamed of collective guilt of what he's done when he only got elected with 30% of the vote in their parliamentary system.
[00:20:59.309 --> 00:21:04.714]  But he doesn't apologize for backing Ukraine and the Nazis, their main military contingent.
[00:21:05.334 --> 00:21:05.695]  Here he is.
[00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.671]  Obviously it's extremely upsetting that this happened.
[00:21:11.311 --> 00:21:16.193]  The Speaker has acknowledged his mistake and has apologized.
[00:21:16.773 --> 00:21:22.395]  But this is something that is deeply embarrassing to the Parliament of Canada and by extension to all Canadians.
[00:21:23.276 --> 00:21:30.058]  I think particularly of Jewish MPs and all members of the Jewish community across the country who are celebrating Yom Kippur today.
[00:21:33.319 --> 00:21:53.236]  I think it's going to be really important that all of us push back against Russian propaganda, Russian disinformation and continue our steadfast and unequivocal support for Ukraine as we did last week with announcing further measures to stand with Ukraine in Russia's illegal war against it.
[00:21:54.797 --> 00:22:02.622]  And now Trudeau is hiding and not going to Parliament because he knows he's going to be confronted for his activities in Parliament.
[00:22:03.262 --> 00:22:11.887]  Here's a clip from today from Ottawa, Canada, where members of the government are bringing this fact up and putting it in his face.
[00:22:12.427 --> 00:22:14.508]  It's time for the criminal Trudeau to go.
[00:22:15.189 --> 00:22:20.812]  It's time for Trudeau that said he admires Xi Jinping and China's dictatorship to be removed by a special election.
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:40.580]  of the opposition.
[00:22:41.465 --> 00:22:48.229]  Honourable members, that the presence in the gallery, all MPs have duties in the chamber and outside.
[00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:54.634]  I just want to remind them that referring to their presence or absence is not allowed in the rules.
[00:22:55.234 --> 00:22:58.176]  The Honourable Opposition Leader, please continue.
[00:22:58.496 --> 00:23:06.081]  Mr. Speaker, Canadians are sick and tired of a Prime Minister who never takes responsibilities for the things that happen under his watch.
[00:23:06.421 --> 00:23:16.568]  Whether it's the record high inflation or interest rates, or the doubling of housing costs, or the constant international embarrassments, he always finds someone else to throw under the bus.
[00:23:16.688 --> 00:23:17.688]  Are you that person?
[00:23:17.688 --> 00:23:18.688]  [applause]
[00:23:18.688 --> 00:23:29.568]   Now I want to shift gears into the legislation that they've got almost complete in Canada
[00:23:29.568 --> 00:23:34.808]   to censor everybody and have total control and shut down websites, delist them, you name
[00:23:35.127 --> 00:23:40.130]  Same thing's happening in the EU, same thing's happening in the UK, and they're trying to ram through similar systems here.
[00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:47.954]  They're mainly doing it through stealth through the Justice Department, CIA, and these large NGOs that have been given billions of dollars of funding.
[00:23:48.254 --> 00:23:50.916]  But there's a big article that's very important on InfoWars.com.
[00:23:51.495 --> 00:23:56.214]   from reclaim the net and that is media and architects of online censorship law
[00:23:56.214 --> 00:24:01.254]   heat pressure on rumble after it defends principle of net neutrality which is what
[00:24:01.254 --> 00:24:04.615]   is the free and open internet remember just five six years ago that's now gone
[00:24:04.615 --> 00:24:09.575]   and so rumble's fight is all of our fights info wars is on rumble our shows are posted there as
[00:24:09.575 --> 00:24:14.534]   well not just made on video people should support them people should become sponsors of them what
[00:24:14.534 --> 00:24:19.014]   they're doing uh is just is very very important with russell brand over there and stephen crowder
[00:24:19.014 --> 00:24:24.055]   and countless others it's a real refuge just like info wars is just like man on video
[00:24:24.377 --> 00:24:29.259]  And these refuges are becoming more and more important because the censorship wasn't just for me or Trump.
[00:24:29.299 --> 00:24:31.120]  I told you, it's for everybody.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:39.284]  So go read the article, look at the global legislation, look at the UN behind it, bragging about it, and just think about how intense this has gotten.
[00:24:39.344 --> 00:24:42.885]  Again, the full article is up on Infowars.com.

[00:25:18.882 --> 00:25:42.642]   info or store dot com ladies and gentlemen we are back live on this tuesday
[00:25:42.642 --> 00:25:45.325]   worldwide transmission Again, thank you so much for tuning in.
[00:25:45.345 --> 00:25:55.032]  Thank you so much for working with the rest of humanity to try to have a future that doesn't end in thermonuclear war or biological war.
[00:25:55.833 --> 00:26:08.002]  We're living through a biological war, the first salvo released by the globalists of Wuhan Lab to then carry out the next phase, their deadly shots and the takeover of our bodies with their cashless society beast system.
[00:26:08.743 --> 00:26:15.827]  But I wanted to make some more key points here on the big story on Infowars.com about contact tracing being back.
[00:26:16.827 --> 00:26:27.472]  Again, we point out in the article that it never went away on the books once Joe Biden put it on the books, right when he stole the election and got into office in 2021.
[00:26:27.532 --> 00:26:30.034]  That's when the new order went in.
[00:26:31.047 --> 00:26:36.869]  But going back a year ago, the airlines stopped doing it for flights coming in to the United States.
[00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:44.872]  It's something they are making you do again, which shows they're rolling out everything they had in place before.
[00:26:44.912 --> 00:26:51.735]  Remember what the White House press secretary said a few weeks ago when Biden was wearing a mask, and they were wearing a mask on TV, and Whoopi Goldberg was.
[00:26:51.775 --> 00:26:54.776]  They were trying to get everybody to go back into the same hysteria.
[00:26:55.757 --> 00:26:59.488]   She said, Oh, the press secretary said things never change.
[00:26:59.508 --> 00:27:01.072]  We're just doing it the way it was always done.
[00:27:01.654 --> 00:27:01.794]  So...
[00:27:03.109 --> 00:27:03.889]  That's their spin.
[00:27:04.129 --> 00:27:05.370]  Oh, no, we're not bringing it back.
[00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:06.410]  It's always been there.
[00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.450]  But the point is, is that it wasn't being enforced.
[00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:15.452]  They weren't doing it until the info we see online and what we see checking on ourselves is about a month ago.
[00:27:16.112 --> 00:27:18.813]  And that's, again, a few weeks after we first broke this news.
[00:27:19.013 --> 00:27:20.493]  But here's the big takeaway.
[00:27:20.693 --> 00:27:22.254]  Here's what I wanted to have sink in.
[00:27:22.294 --> 00:27:23.254]  I know it's sinking in.
[00:27:23.854 --> 00:27:30.843]   And in national studies and polls, people say, It's the number one thing that makes them know this whole COVID thing is garbage.
[00:27:31.724 --> 00:27:40.030]  Out of all the lies we've been told, illegal aliens coming into the United States don't have to take the shots because the UN said they don't want the liability of giving them an experimental, dangerous shot.
[00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:41.711]  That's AP and Reuters, folks.
[00:27:41.751 --> 00:27:42.312]  That's a fact.
[00:27:42.852 --> 00:27:46.675]  The illegal aliens don't have to take it, but they try to intimidate us and make us take it.
[00:27:47.155 --> 00:27:53.660]  Now they've backed off and said nobody ever tried to make you take it, even though they fired 70-something thousand nurses and people in New York alone.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:54.981]  Same thing happened all over the world.
[00:27:55.721 --> 00:27:58.663]   So, Ladies and gentlemen, the illegal aliens don't have to do it.
[00:27:59.103 --> 00:28:07.687]  Now the illegal aliens, kids in New York and other areas, they don't have to take shots to go to school, but they use color law and try to intimidate citizens to make their kids take it.
[00:28:08.207 --> 00:28:13.290]  So they're literally an elite class being protected by the globalists because they're bringing them in to vote.
[00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.451]  They're bringing them in to be signed up on welfare.
[00:28:16.471 --> 00:28:18.492]  The Democrat lawyers skim money off the top.
[00:28:18.532 --> 00:28:19.433]  Same thing's done in Europe.
[00:28:20.333 --> 00:28:28.118]  Just like they control and farm homeless, and then these NGOs make massive money per homeless person, it's the same story over and over again.
[00:28:28.158 --> 00:28:31.961]  This is the bureaucrats, the social workers, taking over.
[00:28:32.001 --> 00:28:39.385]  And I'm not saying all social workers are bad, but this new rollout, this new globalist NGO operation.
[00:28:39.425 --> 00:28:40.386]  So let that sink in.
[00:28:41.105 --> 00:28:44.725]   They want to grope you, they want to ask you questions, they want to contact trace you,
[00:28:44.725 --> 00:28:49.405]   they want to put you in a body scanner, they want to do all this crap flying inside the
[00:28:49.405 --> 00:28:51.566]  country or flying from outside in.
[00:28:51.566 --> 00:28:57.164]   But the borders are wide open and they're not going to be contact tracing any of the
[00:28:57.164 --> 00:28:59.805]   illegal aliens and they're not going to be giving them any of the shots and their kids
[00:28:59.805 --> 00:29:02.964]   are exempt and they're getting a driver's license and blue cities are letting them vote
[00:29:02.964 --> 00:29:04.144]  everywhere.
[00:29:04.144 --> 00:29:08.526]   But if Trump tweets that illegal aliens voted in Georgia, he's indicted for it, even though
[00:29:08.526 --> 00:29:13.445]   they are passing laws everywhere the illegal aliens can vote and be police and rule overs.
[00:29:14.022 --> 00:29:19.869]  The global social engineers don't want there to be anything to keep the third world from coming here.
[00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:28.559]  So they promise them free welfare and jobs and medicine and everything so they can be brainwashed and turn into a permanent political underclass.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:42.570]  And at the same time, and this is very, very important, they're training the American people like dogs going through these TSA checkpoints and all the rest of these systems, setting us up for the World ID, the ESGs, the social credit score.
[00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:48.214]  And once they bankrupt us all, the universal basic income, and then you will eat the bugs.
[00:29:48.654 --> 00:29:55.960]  This is all a global concerted effort in your face, tying into COVID, the contact tracing, the quarantine camps, everything.
[00:29:57.441 --> 00:29:59.723]  So this is just the incredible nature of the takeover.
[00:30:00.203 --> 00:30:01.605]  That's why this story is important.
[00:30:01.645 --> 00:30:04.807]  I noticed some people are saying, hey, the contact tracing never went away.
[00:30:04.967 --> 00:30:05.688]  That's the point.
[00:30:06.569 --> 00:30:07.790]  But they were not enforcing it.
[00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.951]  It was not going on until about a month ago.
[00:30:10.292 --> 00:30:17.258]  Now they've brought it back after over a year of not doing it, which means they're trying to bring it all back, which you can see them doing on every front.
[00:30:18.018 --> 00:30:19.499]  Infowars.com has a story.
[00:30:20.039 --> 00:30:20.679]  Please share it.
[00:30:20.759 --> 00:30:21.439]  Please spread it.
[00:30:21.659 --> 00:30:26.961]  Now I hand the baton to Owen Schroer and Roger Stone's coming up because, hey, it's official.
[00:30:27.041 --> 00:30:30.522]  Big Mike's getting ready to announce she's going to replace Joe Biden.
[00:30:34.104 --> 00:30:40.266]  So we will be hearing from Roger Stone coming up in under an hour on that topic.
[00:30:41.368 --> 00:30:58.678]  And it's interesting, because it was Roger Stone, as far as I know, who was the first to be talking about Michelle Obama, or known as Big Mike now, running as the Democrat nominee for the 2024 presidential election.
[00:30:58.858 --> 00:31:05.322]  But there's going to have to be a lot of pieces that move into place for that to happen.
[00:31:07.239 --> 00:31:20.406]  But I want to ask Roger, because the last time I spoke with him about this, this was after the Obama chef had drowned in four feet of water with a paddleboard behind Obama's mansion at Martha's Vineyard.
[00:31:21.847 --> 00:31:24.389]  But it seems that that maybe has kind of gone away.
[00:31:26.892 --> 00:31:38.714]  These political operators know timing as well as anybody, and so at that time it was like, oh, this is such a bad look for Obama, his chef drowning right outside of his mansion in three feet of water.
[00:31:38.734 --> 00:31:39.654]  This doesn't make any sense.
[00:31:40.275 --> 00:31:41.955]  All the weird cover-ups involved with that.
[00:31:43.495 --> 00:31:50.797]  It felt Clinton-esque, but now it's kind of an afterthought, and I don't really know if that does impact things, but we'll get Roger's take on that.
[00:31:53.482 --> 00:31:58.989]  There's all kinds of mixed emotions right now inside of the Democrat Party.
[00:32:01.512 --> 00:32:05.316]  Because you do still have Biden in the way.
[00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:12.905]  The Biden White House is terrified of a third party candidates running, or excuse me, ruining his chances in 2024.
[00:32:14.813 --> 00:32:15.674]  So what does that mean?
[00:32:15.694 --> 00:32:22.459]  Well, you obviously have RFK Jr., who the Democrats should be giving a shot, should be getting behind.
[00:32:23.339 --> 00:32:30.365]  And maybe that's what this whole posturing behind Biden is all about, pretending that Biden is the real nominee, is to just force RFK Jr.
[00:32:30.445 --> 00:32:32.166]  out of the race, saying, hey, we've already got our guy.
[00:32:32.186 --> 00:32:32.787]  It's Joe Biden.
[00:32:32.807 --> 00:32:33.467]  He's the president.
[00:32:33.487 --> 00:32:35.429]  So just get out of the way, RFK Jr.
[00:32:36.089 --> 00:32:38.571]  And by the way, we're not going to give you Secret Service protection either.
[00:32:38.611 --> 00:32:39.632]  You get the message, bud?
[00:32:39.772 --> 00:32:40.733]  Get the hell out of our way.
[00:32:41.173 --> 00:32:42.054]  Who are the Democrats?
[00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:44.579]  We're the Mafia.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:47.680]  RFK Jr.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.801]  has death threats.
[00:32:48.881 --> 00:32:49.501]  RFK Jr.
[00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:52.662]  has people showing up to his rallies, posing as law enforcement, armed guns.
[00:32:55.563 --> 00:32:57.044]  Again, has to ask for Secret Service.
[00:32:57.504 --> 00:32:58.485]  The Biden administration?
[00:32:58.685 --> 00:32:59.045]  No.
[00:32:59.865 --> 00:33:01.786]  No, you're not going to get Secret Service protection.
[00:33:01.806 --> 00:33:04.747]  Doesn't matter, you're pulling number two in the Democrat Party primaries.
[00:33:05.387 --> 00:33:06.968]  Do you get the message, RFK?
[00:33:10.253 --> 00:33:11.674]  How do you not get the message, RFK?
[00:33:11.714 --> 00:33:16.175]  Do you remember what happened to your family members before you?
[00:33:16.255 --> 00:33:17.676]  Do you get the message, RFK?
[00:33:17.716 --> 00:33:18.616]  Get out of our way!
[00:33:21.077 --> 00:33:30.101]  But okay, not only do you have RFK Jr., if he runs third party, that would hurt the Democrats big time in a national election.
[00:33:32.862 --> 00:33:35.503]  You've also got other parties that are forming.
[00:33:35.543 --> 00:33:39.165]  There's rumors that Tulsi Gabbard might consider running in a third party.
[00:33:41.343 --> 00:33:43.966]  You've got, uh, what's the guy's name?
[00:33:44.186 --> 00:33:45.307]  I forget his name right now.
[00:33:45.447 --> 00:33:46.388]  It's slipping my mind.
[00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:49.551]  Who's been around forever.
[00:33:49.712 --> 00:33:50.472]  He's a black guy.
[00:33:50.492 --> 00:33:51.473]  He's got a big afro.
[00:33:52.214 --> 00:33:52.775]  Cornel West.
[00:33:52.795 --> 00:33:53.355]  Thank you guys.
[00:33:53.595 --> 00:33:54.456]  Uh, Cornel West?
[00:33:55.808 --> 00:33:58.089]  ...is showing up on polls and not doing so bad.
[00:33:58.609 --> 00:34:01.150]  So Cornel West could take votes away from Joe Biden.
[00:34:02.071 --> 00:34:02.971]  If RFK Jr.
[00:34:03.011 --> 00:34:06.793]  runs third party, or alternative party, that takes votes away from Joe Biden.
[00:34:06.833 --> 00:34:10.395]  If Tulsi Gabbard or somebody else enters the race, that would take votes away from Joe Biden.
[00:34:10.415 --> 00:34:12.896]  But then there's the rumors of Michelle Obama, and then there's this!
[00:34:14.201 --> 00:34:16.081]  Gavin Newsom had a 60 minutes interview.
[00:34:16.562 --> 00:34:18.782]  Usually that's how they puff up their political candidates.
[00:34:19.222 --> 00:34:23.003]  And now Sean Hannity to moderate a debate between Newsom and DeSantis.
[00:34:23.663 --> 00:34:26.964]  Now that tells me that's what the deep state wants.
[00:34:28.385 --> 00:34:30.845]  Because why would you have a debate between Newsom and DeSantis?
[00:34:30.865 --> 00:34:32.526]  We don't do political debates in this country.
[00:34:32.566 --> 00:34:33.706]  We cancel political debates.
[00:34:34.526 --> 00:34:36.346]  Biden and Trump wouldn't even do debates.
[00:34:37.007 --> 00:34:38.087]  Because Biden was too scared.
[00:34:39.434 --> 00:34:43.077]  So, DeSantis is now third in the polls behind Trump and Ramaswamy.
[00:34:43.377 --> 00:34:45.139]  Newsom has said he's not even running!
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:46.640]  So why are we doing this?
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:47.781]  We don't do political debates.
[00:34:47.801 --> 00:34:49.183]  We don't do this for TV.
[00:34:49.223 --> 00:34:50.644]  We don't do this for political discourse.
[00:34:51.164 --> 00:34:55.488]  So to me, this means this is what the establishment wants, is Newsom and DeSantis.
[00:34:55.708 --> 00:34:58.371]  We'll get more into this with Roger Stone coming up in under an hour.
[00:34:59.892 --> 00:35:04.156]  Okay, now, let me tell you, I've received a couple big developments.
[00:35:07.088 --> 00:35:24.539]   In the break that are going to be very interesting and I had my eye on one and then I heard from Roger And so this is, look, we got a wild 2024 presidential election cycle coming up.
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:34.205]  And we got a couple new odds and ends for the conversation with Roger that you're not going to want to miss at 12.30 Central right here on the Alex Jones Show at Band.Video.
[00:35:34.245 --> 00:35:39.668]  But let me just kind of dig into some of the other political news that we have here and waste no further time.
[00:35:40.169 --> 00:35:42.210]  And I've got big border news that we need to cover as well.
[00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:44.872]  And that all ties into this dealing with the Biden administration.
[00:35:46.147 --> 00:35:48.868]  Let's just start piledriving through some of this other news.
[00:35:48.928 --> 00:36:00.931]  Now, it's so hard to just pick this up and put it down, considering everything we're dealing with right now, with government corruption, specifically from the American left, the Democrat Party.
[00:36:03.772 --> 00:36:09.294]  Because it's beyond just Jack Smith trying to gag Donald Trump.
[00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:14.773]  You've got the issue where they're claiming, oh, Trump can't even touch a gun, look at a gun, buy a gun.
[00:36:14.793 --> 00:36:18.936]  Well, I don't know Trump's legal status with that, but they're freaked out over that.
[00:36:20.517 --> 00:36:26.781]  And then there's obviously the oppression of our government, the censorship of free speech, the incarceration of free speech, like they're trying to do to me.
[00:36:27.922 --> 00:36:30.724]  We'll have a legal update by the end of the week on that, on our appeal.
[00:36:32.345 --> 00:36:34.407]  But it's just the whole buildup.
[00:36:35.629 --> 00:36:39.350]  That's been going on since 2015 when Donald Trump decided to run for president.
[00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:43.911]  Just every lie, after lie, after lie, after lie, after lie.
[00:36:45.671 --> 00:36:50.873]  But, see, that's the problem is, I can't even properly cover this without giving that entire framework.
[00:36:50.913 --> 00:36:51.713]  But you understand that.
[00:36:51.753 --> 00:36:55.934]  So, Trump's lawyers have now responded to the gag order.
[00:36:57.099 --> 00:36:58.000]  Issued by Jack Smith.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:58.820]  They don't want him talking.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.583]  They don't want him campaigning because that makes Biden look bad.
[00:37:02.903 --> 00:37:14.392]  When Donald Trump is doing two, three, four campaign events a week, having people lined up outside the venues before sunrise, getting 10, 20, 30,000 people at a rally, all the energy, all the coverage, all the media, he's able to talk to media.
[00:37:14.412 --> 00:37:15.413]  He's able to talk to people.
[00:37:15.473 --> 00:37:16.473]  He can actually do it.
[00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:18.355]  Joe Biden literally can't do any of that.
[00:37:18.795 --> 00:37:23.459]  So you juxtapose that just like in 2020, which they were kind of able to get away with because of the pandemic.
[00:37:24.428 --> 00:37:25.208]  But they can't do it now.
[00:37:25.248 --> 00:37:26.069]  So it's an embarrassment.
[00:37:26.529 --> 00:37:36.114]  Trump campaigning and showing the world how popular he is versus Joe Biden crawling through the White House lawn to go to his beachfront Manson in Rehoboth.
[00:37:36.874 --> 00:37:37.695]  It's an embarrassment.
[00:37:37.975 --> 00:37:39.115]  Biden can't campaign.
[00:37:39.195 --> 00:37:40.576]  Biden can't talk to the media.
[00:37:40.916 --> 00:37:41.676]  He's a joke!
[00:37:42.517 --> 00:37:44.518]  So here's the response from Trump's lawyers to the gag order.
[00:37:46.124 --> 00:37:55.232]  The proposed gag order is nothing more than an obvious attempt by the Biden administration to unlawfully silence its most prominent political opponent, who has now taken a commanding lead in the polls.
[00:37:55.953 --> 00:38:01.037]  Indeed, this very motion came on the heels of adverse polling for President Biden.
[00:38:01.718 --> 00:38:04.760]  And we'll have more on that.
[00:38:05.601 --> 00:38:07.943]  His administration's plan is quite simple.
[00:38:08.344 --> 00:38:25.490]   Unleash a 45-page speaking indictment Discuss and leak its talking points in the press and then cynically attempt to invoke the court's authority to prevent President Trump and those acting on his behalf from presenting his side of the story to the American people during a political campaign.
[00:38:26.271 --> 00:38:31.375]  This desperate effort of censorship is unconstitutional on its face.
[00:38:31.616 --> 00:38:32.656]  And then they cite NAACP vs. Button 1963.
[00:38:32.597 --> 00:38:41.436]  ICP vs. Button 1963 and of course that's the case.
[00:38:41.436 --> 00:38:43.157]  Of course that's exactly what it is.
[00:38:43.157 --> 00:38:46.137]  [ Silence ]
[00:38:46.806 --> 00:38:54.128]  And speaking of the poll numbers, we do have new poll numbers in as well.
[00:38:56.569 --> 00:39:02.090]  But see, there's so many different angles to this, I'm not even really sure where I want to go.
[00:39:03.331 --> 00:39:08.552]  So let me take it to this right now, with this headline.
[00:39:10.493 --> 00:39:17.279]  And Trump posted on his Truth Social account a very scathing post.
[00:39:21.902 --> 00:39:27.527]  Trump vows to investigate MSNBC and NBC News for country-threatening treason.
[00:39:29.028 --> 00:39:30.209]  Now why am I bringing this up?
[00:39:30.229 --> 00:39:41.166]   Because I want to try to tie these two things together to make it make sense because We don't like the attacks on the press.
[00:39:42.107 --> 00:39:44.049]  We've been victims of the attacks on the press.
[00:39:44.209 --> 00:39:46.651]  I've been a victim of the attack on the press from the U.S.
[00:39:46.691 --> 00:39:47.011]  government.
[00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:48.052]  My First Amendment rights.
[00:39:49.453 --> 00:39:50.534]  That's obvious.
[00:39:50.975 --> 00:39:53.297]  But this isn't making it about me.
[00:39:53.617 --> 00:40:01.223]  It's about juxtaposing how we stand for free speech versus what Trump is talking about with MSNBC and NBC.
[00:40:02.104 --> 00:40:03.746]  So this is very controversial from Donald Trump.
[00:40:05.771 --> 00:40:10.214]  Let's just, you can call this a hypothetical, or you can call this the reality of the situation.
[00:40:11.454 --> 00:40:46.790]   If you have executives, or the hosts, or the producers, or the big ad buyers at a news corporation, let's say in this case NBC, MSNBC, And let's say they do indeed conspire to lie about Donald Trump, to defame Donald Trump, to make up narratives to hurt Donald Trump, to make up rape accusations, whatever, all these different things, they make it up to lie about Donald Trump and lie about the President of the United States.
[00:40:49.036 --> 00:40:51.459]  I'm not saying I agree with what Trump is saying here.
[00:40:51.759 --> 00:40:55.323]  I'm not even necessarily saying that I would agree with what he's proposing here.
[00:40:56.264 --> 00:41:02.271]  I'm just saying let's look at that as either a hypothetical or a real situation and maybe we should have a debate.
[00:41:04.224 --> 00:41:20.649]  Well, if you have mainstream news executives, boards, hosts, producers, all conspiring against the President of the United States, wittingly, consciously lying to the American people, misrepresenting, misinforming, and deceiving, would you consider that treason?
[00:41:23.189 --> 00:41:26.110]  Again, I'm not saying I'm agreeing with the President on this.
[00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:28.091]  This is a very sensitive thing, and I'm in the media.
[00:41:28.711 --> 00:41:32.052]  So, if anything, my instinct says, I don't like this.
[00:41:34.008 --> 00:41:35.969]  But there's a real situation here.
[00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:39.351]  We are dealing with a fake news media.
[00:41:39.491 --> 00:41:46.775]  We are dealing with a consciously, wittingly, deceptive, lying, disinformation media.
[00:41:46.955 --> 00:41:48.536]  That is a reality.
[00:41:50.257 --> 00:42:09.221]   percent but maybe they have their umbrella of protection Be it how Barack Obama signed legislation making it legal to propagandize the American people.
[00:42:11.441 --> 00:42:20.343]  Now, would Donald Trump be strategic enough in his quote-unquote investigation of these companies to expose that?
[00:42:21.564 --> 00:42:45.715]   Because you have to understand, If this rubber actually met the road, there would be a legal fight, and there would be legal arguments, and how would MSNBC and CNN, or any of them, let's say that they are caught, and they have been caught, more or less, lying to the American people, I mean, that's not really even up for debate, but lying is not a crime.
[00:42:45.915 --> 00:42:54.724]   But if you're conspiring And you have proof of a conspiracy to defraud the American people and defame the President of the United States.
[00:42:55.604 --> 00:42:57.145]  Well, where is their defense then?
[00:42:58.626 --> 00:43:00.767]  Hey, Barack Obama said it was legal.
[00:43:00.847 --> 00:43:01.947]  Look, here's the document.
[00:43:01.987 --> 00:43:03.708]  We were just working for the federal government.
[00:43:04.128 --> 00:43:09.971]  And we know the federal government is working with the mainstream media, thanks to the Twitter files and the Facebook files.
[00:43:10.211 --> 00:43:12.012]  But what about the mainstream news files?
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.002]  So I'm not saying I agree with the President on this.
[00:43:18.062 --> 00:43:19.443]  I think that's a very dangerous thing.
[00:43:20.745 --> 00:43:24.788]  And for somebody in media, I would even say that MSNBC has the right to lie to you.
[00:43:25.849 --> 00:43:30.153]  But if we're talking about conspiring against the President of the United States, maybe Donald Trump feels differently.
[00:43:30.633 --> 00:43:33.375]  I'd rather deal with the wrong First Amendment.
[00:43:34.381 --> 00:43:36.022]  Activity and I'm not saying it's illegal.
[00:43:36.162 --> 00:43:46.988]  I'm just saying lying to the American people deceiving the American people I'd rather deal with that by coming right here on this show or having other shows or other hosts or other journalists exposing it That's discourse.
[00:43:47.108 --> 00:43:47.689]  That's debate.
[00:43:47.749 --> 00:43:48.529]  That's conversation.
[00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:49.510]  That's how we deal with it.
[00:43:50.070 --> 00:44:07.265]   Not the way Trump is proposing but maybe there is a bigger strategy here and Trump is also claiming that Trump says he will carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history if elected.
[00:44:07.865 --> 00:44:08.526]  I like that.
[00:44:09.447 --> 00:44:11.149]  But I really don't know how you do that.
[00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:13.872]  And he's kind of said that before.
[00:44:14.993 --> 00:44:17.616]  And I've got a huge stack of illegal immigration news that we're going to get into.
[00:44:17.676 --> 00:44:20.138]  But here's the thing about this story that is important.
[00:44:20.919 --> 00:44:25.544]  Whether Trump can actually deport 20 million illegal immigrants or not is another story.
[00:44:25.965 --> 00:44:28.387]  Whether he actually wants to or not is another story.
[00:44:28.768 --> 00:44:35.855]  Tariq Nasheed, who is by no means anywhere near a Trump supporter, a Republican, a right-winger, a conservative.
[00:44:36.977 --> 00:44:40.641]  He re-shared this story and says Trump is starting to grow on me.
[00:44:42.298 --> 00:44:47.525]  Folks, this is Trump throwing fastballs right down the plate for the American people.
[00:44:47.786 --> 00:44:50.810]  This is Trump delivering steak and potatoes for the American people.
[00:44:51.131 --> 00:44:55.116]  And I understand why purists get upset with some of the things Trump says.
[00:44:56.334 --> 00:44:57.755]  About abortion and these other things.
[00:44:58.095 --> 00:44:59.176]  He's playing politics.
[00:44:59.196 --> 00:45:00.196]  He's a politician now.
[00:45:01.017 --> 00:45:01.797]  I'm just warning.
[00:45:01.637 --> 00:45:06.876]   I've always been against political purism, because if you really think that somebody has to agree with you all the
[00:45:06.876 --> 00:45:10.757]   time, then really you are actually in a cult, politically, and
[00:45:10.757 --> 00:45:12.556]  you should probably not be that way.

[00:46:50.864 --> 00:46:55.448]  And I got to tell you, my heart always gets a little warmer when I see Roger.
[00:46:55.568 --> 00:46:57.910]  He just brightens my spirit.
[00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:59.191]  He brightens my soul.
[00:46:59.412 --> 00:47:00.392]  I really do love that man.
[00:47:02.114 --> 00:47:03.695]  But we're going to get serious with Roger coming up.
[00:47:04.276 --> 00:47:06.318]  Now, ahead of this, let me tell you.
[00:47:07.898 --> 00:47:11.702]  We got... I mean, folks, this border thing is just out of control.
[00:47:11.982 --> 00:47:12.402]  Here we go.
[00:47:13.023 --> 00:47:19.709]  Customs and Border Protection cuts barbed wire barrier, allows illegal immigrants to flood into Eagle Pass, Texas.
[00:47:19.749 --> 00:47:20.029]  Now look.
[00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:22.272]  They're running the whole show.
[00:47:22.972 --> 00:47:23.252]  Okay?
[00:47:24.774 --> 00:47:28.477]  Border Patrol is running the entire show.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:30.741]  And I feel bad for them.
[00:47:31.101 --> 00:47:35.663]  And you've seen some of the videos and some of the undercover videos and we've interviewed some whistleblowers.
[00:47:35.703 --> 00:47:37.384]  They don't go on camera.
[00:47:37.404 --> 00:47:39.645]  They don't want their identities to be revealed because they get punished.
[00:47:40.125 --> 00:47:43.087]  You get punished for actually stopping illegal immigration if you're a member of Border Patrol.
[00:47:43.407 --> 00:47:44.347]  That's not rhetoric.
[00:47:44.408 --> 00:47:45.608]  You literally get punished.
[00:47:46.008 --> 00:47:47.469]  You saw what happened to the guy on horseback.
[00:47:47.509 --> 00:47:48.790]  They said he was whipping people.
[00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:50.611]  Just a complete made-up lie.
[00:47:51.111 --> 00:47:55.133]  So that's the desperate lengths they'll go to to punish Border Patrol for protecting the border.
[00:47:56.041 --> 00:48:00.322]  But, okay, now we see them cutting barbed wire to let them in.
[00:48:00.762 --> 00:48:06.343]  We see them putting ladders down at the walls so that they can climb up the ladders and get in.
[00:48:08.223 --> 00:48:11.224]  Obviously, they hop onto Border Patrol buses and they get brought in.
[00:48:12.444 --> 00:48:14.424]  They remove the wall in Arizona.
[00:48:14.644 --> 00:48:16.245]  They open the gates in Texas.
[00:48:16.445 --> 00:48:18.225]  They remove the floating barrier in Texas.
[00:48:18.565 --> 00:48:21.285]  So, no, Border Patrol is facilitating this.
[00:48:21.345 --> 00:48:24.446]  Border Patrol are basically, they're like the pimps.
[00:48:26.724 --> 00:48:30.447]  Or they're like the bottom bitch that's out there running the whole thing.
[00:48:30.547 --> 00:48:34.670]  And I feel bad because these are good men and women, but I guess it's the same old story.
[00:48:34.971 --> 00:48:40.955]  In Biden's economy, everybody's broke, so they've got to put food on the table and they've got to keep working.
[00:48:41.196 --> 00:48:42.256]  But you're looking at all the videos.
[00:48:42.296 --> 00:48:46.900]  I told my crew, yeah, I just showed the videos of the boat loads and the train loads and the plane loads and the bus loads and everything coming in.
[00:48:48.121 --> 00:48:50.323]  And then Jen Psaki says the border is secure.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.141]  And this is a big issue, folks.
[00:48:53.241 --> 00:48:55.984]  Even Democrats are now realizing that this is a top issue.
[00:48:56.044 --> 00:49:01.249]  So Trump going hard on the border and hard on illegal immigration will reach Democrat voters.
[00:49:01.809 --> 00:49:04.492]  Elon Musk says he's going to be going down to the border.
[00:49:05.473 --> 00:49:13.861]  He says he spoke with Representative Tony Gonzalez and he plans to visit Eagle Pass later this week.
[00:49:17.339 --> 00:49:19.340]  And again, he's sharing this footage.
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:25.482]  Now, last night, ladies and gentlemen, talk about heartbreaking stuff.
[00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:28.024]  Talk about gut-wrenching stuff.
[00:49:31.245 --> 00:49:36.767]  Grand City Border Patrol agents find a two-month-old child left abandoned at the border.
[00:49:36.787 --> 00:49:38.588]  This is a two-month-old baby, folks.
[00:49:38.688 --> 00:49:40.469]  I mean, I just, oh my gosh.
[00:49:41.852 --> 00:49:44.674]  Oh my gosh, your heart just breaks.
[00:49:44.814 --> 00:49:47.815]  But okay, try to put the emotion down if you can.
[00:49:49.316 --> 00:49:58.522]  What type of a situation is there where a two-month-old baby gets abandoned at the border?
[00:50:00.623 --> 00:50:04.125]  Folks, it's basically your passport.
[00:50:05.535 --> 00:50:17.406]  You come across with a baby, you come across with a child, that's your free entry into the country, and a lot of times the individuals, I mean, can you imagine the type of individual that abandons a two-month-old?
[00:50:17.426 --> 00:50:22.351]  Okay, so, probably, let's just make a pretty safe assumption, that's a bad person.
[00:50:22.751 --> 00:50:24.473]  That's a real bad, bad person.
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:30.902]  But no, that's what they do, is they use children as their get-out-of-jail-free card.
[00:50:31.102 --> 00:50:34.283]  Oh, look, it's my kid, it's my niece, it's my nephew, it's my baby.
[00:50:34.763 --> 00:50:37.304]  And then they get in the country, and then they abandon the children.
[00:50:38.405 --> 00:50:42.706]  And then these children basically just become tools of illegal immigration.
[00:50:42.806 --> 00:50:49.249]  They become a profit for the cartels and for the coyotes.
[00:50:49.709 --> 00:50:54.031]  And they just have these children, and they just use them as mules, and they just get passed and passed and passed and passed.
[00:50:54.693 --> 00:50:55.674]  So people can get in.
[00:50:56.034 --> 00:50:58.998]  And then there's just wild scenes in New York City now, every night.
[00:51:00.679 --> 00:51:06.025]  And there's debates on whether Mayor Greg Abbott's strategy, busing them to New York, is good or not.
[00:51:07.386 --> 00:51:09.368]  Honestly, I see both sides of this issue.
[00:51:09.448 --> 00:51:16.652]   Politically, I think it's worked, because now the Democrats And specifically in New York City, realize how bad it is.
[00:51:16.672 --> 00:51:17.933]  But folks, these scenes are out of control.
[00:51:18.173 --> 00:51:29.481]  New York City now preparing to spend another $1 billion on hotels to shelter illegal immigrants for up to three more years as they're sleeping on the streets, taking over the hotels, taking over everything.
[00:51:29.842 --> 00:51:31.063]  They're taking over our country.
[00:51:32.244 --> 00:51:40.890]  And I'm joined by my former co-host, and also, they tried to make him a political prisoner first, Roger Stone.
[00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:51.610]   But before we bring Roger on live, Roger actually made the prediction of Michelle Obama running for president long before anyone else.
[00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:56.550]  In fact, this is a clip from 2019.
[00:51:56.550 --> 00:52:03.670]   Now, as a veteran of many years in American politics, I'm going to tell you something
[00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:04.670]  somewhat shocking.
[00:52:05.111 --> 00:52:09.752]  Joe Biden will not be the nominee of the Democratic Party in 2024.
[00:52:11.072 --> 00:52:13.433]  Kamala Harris will briefly become president.
[00:52:13.813 --> 00:52:20.655]  But the only way in their party they can replace a woman of color is with another woman of color.
[00:52:21.195 --> 00:52:22.835]  And yes, you heard it here first.
[00:52:23.235 --> 00:52:27.097]  The Democratic nominee for president will be Michelle Obama.
[00:52:29.654 --> 00:52:30.614]  Oh, the shock!
[00:52:30.694 --> 00:52:31.274]  The horror!
[00:52:31.374 --> 00:52:34.175]  They have already rigged their primaries.
[00:52:35.055 --> 00:52:48.018]  The reason that they have cancelled the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary is to put South Carolina, a state where a majority of the Democratic primaries, or primary voters, are African Americans.
[00:52:48.738 --> 00:52:58.080]  And they will allow Gavin Newsom to purchase the vice presidential nomination, but the Obamas will hold him up for six or eight hundred million dollars to do so.
[00:52:59.451 --> 00:53:00.794]  You heard it here first.
[00:53:00.954 --> 00:53:01.435]  That's right.
[00:53:01.455 --> 00:53:04.582]  Steve Bannon says it in three weeks, remember I said it first.
[00:53:04.782 --> 00:53:07.127]  That's right, you did hear it from Roger Stone first.
[00:53:07.307 --> 00:53:10.434]  Now I gotta tell you folks, because...
[00:53:11.678 --> 00:53:14.481]  I'm like a media addict.
[00:53:15.081 --> 00:53:19.165]  I'm not just a microphone fiend here on the air all the time, I'm also a media addict.
[00:53:19.245 --> 00:53:31.556]  I'm consuming six to ten hours of media every day and I'm just telling you right now, there's a reason why I consult with Roger Stone on a lot of political things before I take stuff to air because he's got one of the highest batting averages in the league.
[00:53:32.176 --> 00:53:46.145]   Now Roger, really your prediction there is actually multi-dimensional because We could be looking at a situation where maybe Biden does have to step down and Kamala Harris is president briefly, so even that had incredible foresight.
[00:53:46.865 --> 00:53:51.087]  But getting to the Michelle Obama issue, where do you stand on that today?
[00:53:52.381 --> 00:53:57.884]  Last time we spoke was after the Obama chef magically drowned in three feet of water right behind Obama's mansion.
[00:53:58.764 --> 00:54:02.606]  It looks like the riffraff from that has kind of maybe settled.
[00:54:02.646 --> 00:54:03.466]  The dust has settled.
[00:54:03.486 --> 00:54:06.107]  Maybe it won't be so politically impactful as we might have thought.
[00:54:06.167 --> 00:54:13.110]  So where do you stand on your first prediction from almost five years ago that Michelle Obama will be the 2024 nominee?
[00:54:15.922 --> 00:54:20.166]  Well, first of all, thanks for having me back with you, Owen.
[00:54:20.266 --> 00:54:31.717]  The feeling is mutual because my daily show at StoneZone.Live airs the same time as your daily show, The War Room, where I was proud to be your co-host for over a year.
[00:54:32.217 --> 00:54:35.580]  I have to watch your show in rerun, but I literally never miss it.
[00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:37.302]  You're doing an amazing job.
[00:54:38.248 --> 00:54:50.585]  That particular clip actually is from this year, but it is accurate that all the way back to 2019, I foresaw the rise of Michelle Obama as the ultimate Democratic candidate.
[00:54:51.444 --> 00:55:00.189]  If anything, the situation has been expedited by the virtual collapse of Joe Biden on all fronts.
[00:55:00.629 --> 00:55:16.639]   First of all, his inability to perform on the stump, to put together a coherent sentence, to remember where he was yesterday, his constant falling down, these tall tales he was Born in the synagogues, he was raised in the synagogues of Delaware.
[00:55:16.899 --> 00:55:20.321]  Now wait a minute, I was raised by the Puerto Rican community in Delaware.
[00:55:20.341 --> 00:55:23.544]  Now wait a minute, I was a law professor in Philadelphia.
[00:55:24.545 --> 00:55:31.390]  You know, I was arrested in the civil rights demonstrations of the 60s, which of course he wasn't.
[00:55:32.111 --> 00:55:44.978]   And then most disgracefully, this idea that he and his wife were bereft When they saw their son Bo's flag-draped coffin return from Iraq.
[00:55:45.298 --> 00:55:52.660]  And of course his son Bo tragically died of a brain tumor while serving as Attorney General, not during military service.
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:56:09.307]   So the collapse of Biden, plus the impact of his policies, and the fact that he is utterly unelectable now, and that the sachems in the Democratic Party recognize that, I would only alter my prediction very slightly.
[00:56:10.168 --> 00:56:13.090]  I don't think that Joe will leave office early.
[00:56:13.671 --> 00:56:16.233]  Getting the two-thirds necessary in the U.S.
[00:56:16.273 --> 00:56:26.682]  Senate to impeach him, even in the face of growing evidence, what will ultimately be overwhelming evidence, is a hard barrier.
[00:56:27.403 --> 00:56:43.262]   And I guess Joe will never want to give up the ability to pardon himself, his son, and his brother and other members of the Biden crime family, which my guess is he will do after the next election, but before he leaves office.
[00:56:43.302 --> 00:56:50.542]   So I think In late November of this year, perhaps a little earlier than that, he will announce that he is not going to stand for re-election.
[00:56:51.062 --> 00:56:54.303]  The drumbeat is now overwhelming in his own party.
[00:56:55.263 --> 00:57:01.885]  And the same Democrats who know Joe Biden can't win, know Kamala Harris cannot win.
[00:57:02.585 --> 00:57:19.367]   And therefore, just within the makeup of their party, as I said in that clip, The only way politically they can replace a woman of color who is at least theoretically next in line is with a more popular woman of color, in this case, Michelle Obama.
[00:57:20.268 --> 00:57:22.990]  She is extraordinarily popular in the country.
[00:57:23.471 --> 00:57:27.354]  She is viewed as nonpolitical when she's very political.
[00:57:28.234 --> 00:57:34.778]  And viewers out there who want to make a crude joke about her gender or think this is some kind of joke, they need to think twice.
[00:57:35.238 --> 00:57:42.802]  She will be extraordinarily well-funded, and she leaves much of the baggage of the Bidens and the Biden administration behind.
[00:57:43.162 --> 00:57:55.429]  And then, as I said, Gavin Newsom, who is unfortunately for him a white guy in today's Democratic Party, will be allowed to purchase the vice presidential nomination by putting up hundreds of millions of dollars to fuel the ticket.
[00:57:56.986 --> 00:57:59.967]  So how do you see this ouster of Joe Biden going?
[00:58:00.007 --> 00:58:02.569]  Because at least he's posturing that he wants to run.
[00:58:02.629 --> 00:58:06.150]  The Biden White House is posturing that he's running and he's the candidate.
[00:58:06.691 --> 00:58:10.332]  They are ignoring the campaign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:58:10.392 --> 00:58:13.454]  with kind of the veil that, hey, Biden's the nominee.
[00:58:13.554 --> 00:58:14.254]  He's our guy.
[00:58:14.334 --> 00:58:15.395]  He's currently the president.
[00:58:16.255 --> 00:58:19.778]  So how does Biden cut a deal with the Democrats to kind of soft land this?
[00:58:19.838 --> 00:58:22.541]  Because I don't think he really wants to go up against them.
[00:58:22.601 --> 00:58:24.783]  He's obviously got his own problems.
[00:58:25.203 --> 00:58:26.824]  They obviously don't want him.
[00:58:27.285 --> 00:58:36.773]  I believe at this point Kevin McCarthy is doing the work of the Democrats and moving forward impeachment inquiries now so that they can use that to remove Biden without having to do it themselves.
[00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:47.544]  So what do you think the deal that gets made here for Biden to kind of have the switcheroo at the opportune moment for the Democrats without them doing too much damage to themselves?
[00:58:48.848 --> 00:58:49.869]  Well, let me be very clear.
[00:58:49.929 --> 00:58:55.493]  I think that there's great internecine warfare going on inside the Democratic Party today.
[00:58:56.253 --> 00:59:19.412]   When powerful columnists at the New York Times and the Washington Post say that you should step aside, when the coverage of the epic corruption of Hunter Biden, as well as his father and his uncle, moved to the front pages of the mainstream media, when the Obama-ites Fire back by planting stories about Barack Obama allegedly being gay.
[00:59:19.912 --> 00:59:22.155]  You can see that there's a power struggle going on.
[00:59:22.715 --> 00:59:25.178]  Dr. Jill Biden does not want to leave.
[00:59:25.598 --> 00:59:33.767]  Joe Biden doesn't want to give up his ability to pardon his son, perhaps himself, his brother and other members of the crime family.
[00:59:33.807 --> 00:59:36.910]  So what you have here, I think, is an internal struggle.
[00:59:37.712 --> 00:59:49.656]  But those who want to replace Joe are getting increasingly hysterical based on a political resurgence by Donald Trump that nobody, nobody could have foreseen.
[00:59:50.157 --> 00:59:54.178]  Trump is more popular today than he has ever been.
[00:59:54.998 --> 00:59:59.060]  Joe Biden rushing to Michigan to address auto workers.
[00:59:59.841 --> 01:00:03.785]  I don't know what he has that he could possibly say to them that would make them happy.
[01:00:03.805 --> 01:00:05.627]  He's phasing out- And by the way, this is on the screen right now.
[01:00:05.647 --> 01:00:08.289]  This is one of the most awkward things I've ever seen from Joe Biden.
[01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:09.470]  I had not seen this yet.
[01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:10.812]  This is just strange.
[01:00:12.765 --> 01:00:15.227]  Well, President Trump, I think, had a masterstroke.
[01:00:15.327 --> 01:00:35.885]  Instead of going to the debate, which is going to be a pretty sleepy affair, sponsored by Fox News, Trump, who's really speaking to the actual issues that affect the American people, decided that he would fly to Michigan and stand in solidarity with the United Auto Workers, who, let's face it, whose jobs are being phased out.
[01:00:36.486 --> 01:00:41.226]   This electric mandate will ultimately mean that all cars, to the extent
[01:00:41.226 --> 01:00:46.456]   that you're allowed to own a car, Owen, will be made in China and will be fueled by
[01:00:46.456 --> 01:00:47.247]  electric.
[01:00:47.247 --> 01:00:50.567]   So I don't know what, I haven't had a chance to see this clip.
[01:00:50.567 --> 01:00:53.686]  I don't know what it is Joe Biden could possibly say.
[01:00:53.686 --> 01:00:54.686]  This is a fresh clip.
[01:00:54.707 --> 01:00:55.567]  We're about to go to a break.
[01:00:55.627 --> 01:00:56.728]  Roger Stone is our guest.
[01:00:57.088 --> 01:01:03.352]  Joe Biden, he, so, I mean, at least he, somebody told him, hey Joe, you better go to this autoworker strike before Trump does.
[01:01:03.772 --> 01:01:08.735]  But actually, that's going to be bad advice because now he's going to look even more of a fool than he already does.
[01:01:08.795 --> 01:01:09.916]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[01:01:11.036 --> 01:01:13.518]  Well, it's always fun, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:13.778 --> 01:01:15.239]  You know what I was doing in the break?
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:18.201]  Heard from my friends at the federal government.
[01:01:18.621 --> 01:01:21.382]  I have to turn myself in by October 24th.
[01:01:23.373 --> 01:01:24.354]  That's what I did during the break.
[01:01:24.374 --> 01:01:25.655]  What did you guys do during the break?
[01:01:26.515 --> 01:01:27.116]  That's fun.
[01:01:27.196 --> 01:01:29.417]  So my speech is now incarceration worthy.
[01:01:29.458 --> 01:01:35.742]  What I say on this show, the Biden administration and the Department of Justice believes is incarceration worthy.
[01:01:38.224 --> 01:01:41.827]  I'm probably going to have to be consulting with my lawyer at some point in time today.
[01:01:43.237 --> 01:01:44.118]  We are appealing it.
[01:01:44.318 --> 01:01:46.259]  The government has till the end of the week to respond to that.
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:48.941]  But that's just, that's what you get in Biden's America.
[01:01:49.082 --> 01:01:54.926]  That's what you get when the Democrats are attacking the First Amendment and want to incarcerate their opposition.
[01:01:56.287 --> 01:01:58.509]  In fact, I mean, I'll just do this right now.
[01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:02.872]  Hey, Norm, I'm hosting the Alex Jones Show right now.
[01:02:02.932 --> 01:02:04.333]  Let me call you back in the next break.
[01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:11.153]  break. Does that work? Okay.
[01:02:10.801 --> 01:02:12.022]  Alright, thank you.
[01:02:12.543 --> 01:02:14.485]  Sorry guys, that's just how it goes when you're in the info war.
[01:02:14.926 --> 01:02:15.767]  Roger Stone is with us.
[01:02:15.827 --> 01:02:18.190]  Alright Roger, you know all about this too well.
[01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:21.454]  You were co-host with me when you were going through your persecution.
[01:02:22.275 --> 01:02:24.938]  But okay, let's talk about what's going on here.
[01:02:25.018 --> 01:02:28.902]  Joe Biden in this video, because you said it in the last segment, and then Joe Biden gives you the proof.
[01:02:29.423 --> 01:02:31.985]  I mean, this guy obviously is not very well.
[01:02:32.566 --> 01:02:34.287]  Cognitively, he's not very well.
[01:02:34.688 --> 01:02:36.629]  He's pretty much a controlled president.
[01:02:36.669 --> 01:02:43.375]  He's said so, in so many words, multiple times during his presidency, saying, oh, I can't do that, or oh, I can't do that.
[01:02:43.415 --> 01:02:44.496]  Oh, they'll get mad if I do this.
[01:02:44.697 --> 01:02:47.599]  He gets off the stage and he does this wandering act, like, where am I going?
[01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:48.220]  What am I doing?
[01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:55.668]  But obviously they thought it was a strategic move to send him up to the autoworker strike before Trump got up there.
[01:02:56.028 --> 01:02:57.428]  And then he fumbles and bumbles around.
[01:02:57.448 --> 01:02:59.789]  He grabs a megaphone out of somebody's hands.
[01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:02.090]  I mean, this is just embarrassing.
[01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:08.453]  And now we're going to have that juxtaposed with Trump, who's going to be there tomorrow during the Republican debates.
[01:03:08.593 --> 01:03:09.753]  And it's going to be smooth.
[01:03:09.793 --> 01:03:11.074]  It's going to be charismatic.
[01:03:11.534 --> 01:03:16.796]  I mean, how damaging are these public events for Joe Biden from your political expertise?
[01:03:16.896 --> 01:03:18.397]  I mean, this does not look good.
[01:03:19.758 --> 01:03:26.800]  Well, you know, in all honesty, Owen, the decision to go to Michigan was not necessarily a bad decision.
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:33.982]  Their real problem is that Joe Biden has nothing to say to these union members that is going to console or help them.
[01:03:34.762 --> 01:03:36.202]  And I understand why they're doing this.
[01:03:36.242 --> 01:03:41.864]   A year ago, a polling showed among union members Biden leading Trump 51-42.
[01:03:42.284 --> 01:03:47.466]  Today, Trump is leading Biden among union members 46-43.
[01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:52.828]  That's because union members are well aware of the cost of gasoline.
[01:03:53.228 --> 01:03:58.010]  Union members are well aware of the 76% increase in the cost of basic groceries.
[01:03:58.469 --> 01:04:03.429]   Union members are having a hard time making ends meet because of the epic inflation that
[01:04:03.429 --> 01:04:07.469]  is destroying the buying power of the dollar.
[01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:12.629]   Union members are struggling, yet they see their own country shipping billions of dollars
[01:04:12.629 --> 01:04:19.069]   to Ukraine to protect their border when union members are concerned about their country
[01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:25.168]   being flooded with illegals, illegals who may attack them, may rob them, may try to
[01:04:25.168 --> 01:04:30.789]   sell drugs to their kids, or may ultimately be in a position to take their jobs if there
[01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:32.669]  are any jobs left.
[01:04:32.671 --> 01:04:35.594]  So Joe Biden has no message for these people.
[01:04:35.915 --> 01:04:47.849]  Donald Trump tomorrow, I think, is going to give an extraordinary speech that will be content laden because he's opposed to the electrical vehicle mandates that are trying to be forced on us by the Biden administration.
[01:04:48.089 --> 01:04:53.289]   And he understands that nobody will be able to afford a car if we don't do something to
[01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:59.489]   drop the cost of gasoline, which of course was at all time lows as we moved not only
[01:04:59.489 --> 01:05:05.529]   through independent energy independence, but actually to energy dominance, where we were
[01:05:05.592 --> 01:05:07.353]  So the deep state is in a tizzy.
[01:05:07.173 --> 01:05:11.852]   only be able to sell our own country at the cheapest prices ever, but also being able
[01:05:11.852 --> 01:05:14.012]  to export it to other countries.
[01:05:14.012 --> 01:05:18.753]   This is one of Donald Trump's greatest, I think his greatest achievements.
[01:05:18.753 --> 01:05:21.133]  So the deep state is in a tizzy.
[01:05:21.133 --> 01:05:26.293]   They're in a complete tailspin because their entitled strategy to take down Donald Trump
[01:05:26.293 --> 01:05:29.093]  is backfiring very badly.
[01:05:29.093 --> 01:05:34.532]   The idea here was to destroy Trump, to sap his campaign funds, because he had to use
[01:05:34.532 --> 01:05:40.333]   money to spend on lawyers, to destroy his campaign schedule because he has to sit in
[01:05:40.333 --> 01:05:47.053]   a courtroom through some period of the campaign schedule, and to further blacken his name
[01:05:47.053 --> 01:05:48.373]  with the American people.
[01:05:48.728 --> 01:05:49.988]  None of that is working.
[01:05:50.048 --> 01:05:52.749]  It's backfiring in spectacular fashion.
[01:05:53.169 --> 01:05:55.290]  I've known Donald Trump for 45 years.
[01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:59.651]  I've wanted him to run for president, as you know, since 1988.
[01:06:00.131 --> 01:06:10.534]  I'm a long-term student of polling pertaining to Donald Trump, and I can tell you definitively, he has never been stronger than he is at this exact moment.
[01:06:10.674 --> 01:06:14.696]  Not in 2016, not in 2020, not ever.
[01:06:14.936 --> 01:06:22.760]   So he's a natural phenomena, and he really clearly He understands the stakes in this next election.
[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:26.402]  He understands that this is, as he puts it, the final battle.
[01:06:26.843 --> 01:06:32.267]  Either we defeat the globalists in this next election, or it's all over for America.
[01:06:32.507 --> 01:06:40.654]   And when Rachel Maddow says, well, if Trump wins, it may be our last American election, Again, Alinsky's rules.
[01:06:40.734 --> 01:06:56.526]  No, actually, if it looks like Trump is going to win, I don't put it beyond this administration to start a purposeful war with Russia so they can enact the War Powers Act in order to postpone the next election indefinitely.
[01:06:56.806 --> 01:06:58.027]  Here's the thing about the left.
[01:06:58.507 --> 01:07:03.151]  Everything they're accusing you of doing is exactly what they themselves are doing.
[01:07:03.411 --> 01:07:10.257]  It really is that simple, whether it's them claiming you're a racist, or whether it's them claiming it'll be the last American election.
[01:07:10.277 --> 01:07:11.858]  It really is that simple, Roger.
[01:07:12.138 --> 01:07:15.120]  Whatever the American left claims you're doing, it's what they're doing.
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:25.589]  It's kind of like Maxine Waters did an interview on MSNBC, and she claims that Republicans want to destroy America, and then every Democrat Party policy is destroying America.
[01:07:25.649 --> 01:07:31.173]  Just look at the major metropolitan cities that are all destroyed with decades of Democrat Party leadership.
[01:07:31.193 --> 01:07:32.254]  But let me ask you a question here.
[01:07:33.649 --> 01:07:34.451]  Kevin McCarthy.
[01:07:34.471 --> 01:07:36.316]  Now this guy's been pretty much an empty suit.
[01:07:37.037 --> 01:07:42.350]  His whole fight for the speakership now seems to have appeared to have been for nothing.
[01:07:43.584 --> 01:07:46.625]  I'm now convinced that Kevin McCarthy is working for the Democrats.
[01:07:46.685 --> 01:07:49.166]  Again, you mentioned the media now flipping on Biden.
[01:07:49.446 --> 01:07:52.326]  All of a sudden, the poll numbers are saying Trump is kicking Biden's ass.
[01:07:52.346 --> 01:07:54.667]  I think they always have been, but now they're just admitting it.
[01:07:55.207 --> 01:08:00.108]  And now you have Kevin McCarthy finally filing articles of impeachment for an impeachment inquiry.
[01:08:00.448 --> 01:08:05.530]  To me, this all looks like all moves by the Democrat Party establishment to get Biden out of the way.
[01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:08.431]  It looks like McCarthy is the Republican wing of the Democrat Party.
[01:08:08.611 --> 01:08:09.671]  Do you agree with that analysis?
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.183]  I think it may be only a slight overstatement.
[01:08:13.223 --> 01:08:19.629]  Look, I very much admire the efforts by Congressman Matt Gaetz to keep Kevin McCarthy's feet held to the fire.
[01:08:20.009 --> 01:08:25.775]  He made a number of pledges when we allowed him to become Speaker, and he hasn't kept his word on any of it.
[01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:33.000]  Uh, why no member of the Biden family has yet to be subpoenaed, uh, by this Congress to testify in open session?
[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:48.350]  Uh, why we have not published other than the one Congressman, uh, Jason Smith, uh, who did publish the actual documents proving the coverup by the DOJ and the IRS of the Hunter Biden investigation.
[01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:52.012]  Uh, why are the Republicans in the House dragging their feet?
[01:08:52.353 --> 01:08:57.136]   So while I may have some minor quibbles with Matt Gaetz over some Florida politics.
[01:08:57.476 --> 01:09:00.239]  He continues to laud Ron DeSantis.
[01:09:00.419 --> 01:09:00.959]  I do not.
[01:09:01.119 --> 01:09:05.123]  I think Ron DeSantis is a backstabbing, treacherous weasel.
[01:09:05.563 --> 01:09:07.625]  That's inside the family fighting.
[01:09:08.165 --> 01:09:16.572]  I think what Matt Gaetz is doing overall in calling out Kevin McCarthy shows that he's a true America first patriot.
[01:09:17.513 --> 01:09:22.097]  And McCarthy, I think, sadly, his days are numbered if he doesn't take action.
[01:09:22.137 --> 01:09:23.298]  He promised us action.
[01:09:23.698 --> 01:09:26.701]  He became Speaker only because of those promises.
[01:09:26.721 --> 01:09:29.304]  We're ready for him to step up to the plate.
[01:09:29.784 --> 01:09:31.506]  We're not for an impeachment inquiry.
[01:09:31.786 --> 01:09:34.209]  We're for moving articles of impeachment.
[01:09:34.889 --> 01:09:36.711]  And let's get some subpoenas going as well.
[01:09:36.751 --> 01:09:37.572]  Roger Stone is with us.
[01:09:37.632 --> 01:09:38.573]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:38.593 --> 01:09:39.214]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:09:40.549 --> 01:09:48.792]  So, you know, you've seen the famous clip of Bill O'Reilly when his teleprompter doesn't work and he goes crazy and it's the famous, F it, we'll do it live.
[01:09:48.832 --> 01:09:53.793]  And most news hosts can't even go on air without a teleprompter or somebody in their ear telling them what's going on.
[01:09:54.814 --> 01:09:56.734]  Here's what we deal with at InfoWars.
[01:09:57.415 --> 01:10:06.618]  In the last break, I was in communication with the federal government that tell me I have till October 24th to turn myself in to jail for my speech.
[01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:16.713]  And then in the last break, I was talking to my lawyer and just getting him the updated legal documents and getting an updated status as far as our appeal is concerned.
[01:10:18.213 --> 01:10:23.075]  And also, just as a little added bonus, the U.S.
[01:10:23.095 --> 01:10:26.056]  government is still in possession of two of my phones.
[01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:29.583]  Okay, so they still have two of my phones.
[01:10:29.623 --> 01:10:33.145]  I guess they want to hang on to those forever, or until the end of the case.
[01:10:33.165 --> 01:10:38.847]  So that's what we deal with, and then I have to come on air and host the show with the great Roger Stone, and by the way, we're just fine.
[01:10:39.408 --> 01:10:41.089]  But see, that's what we do here at InfoWars.
[01:10:41.129 --> 01:10:53.655]  But okay, you know, it just kind of adds to the gravity and the reality of the situation when the federal government calls you and says you have until October 24th to turn yourself in, and then goes through all the rules and regulations and everything else about it.
[01:10:54.634 --> 01:11:16.286]   and uh... you're facing two months in jail for your speech and yes it is my speech you can read the sentencing memo for yourself thirty page sentencing memo four sections of it all about my speech all about my speech so yeah this is a big case Now, sure, I could just turn myself in and serve two months in jail and hopefully wipe my hands with it.
[01:11:16.726 --> 01:11:21.630]  Of course, then there's the added love of the supervised probation a year after, which is, by the way, unprecedented.
[01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:22.650]  Never happens.
[01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:25.912]  You either get incarceration or supervised probation.
[01:11:25.953 --> 01:11:26.633]  You never get both.
[01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:28.054]  But they want to give me both.
[01:11:28.094 --> 01:11:29.575]  They really want to send a message, don't they?
[01:11:29.835 --> 01:11:31.456]  They really want to make an example of me.
[01:11:31.536 --> 01:11:33.898]  So, uh, that's the loving government.
[01:11:34.978 --> 01:11:46.002]  Oh, oh, and let me just say, by the way, added bonus, I also had two government agents at my house this morning for a house visit just to make sure that everything is above board and that I'm on good behavior.
[01:11:46.342 --> 01:11:48.802]  So that's what I deal with for my speech.
[01:11:49.563 --> 01:12:01.787]  So two government agents at my house this morning, one government agent calling me telling me I have till October 24th to send myself in, going through all the regulations, sending me the documents, and then I've also had multiple phone calls with my lawyer today.
[01:12:02.247 --> 01:12:04.687]   And hey, Just a little, just a little fun here.
[01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:07.208]  Let's just also host the Alex Jones Show with Roger Stone.
[01:12:07.248 --> 01:12:07.628]  Why not?
[01:12:07.668 --> 01:12:08.808]  Let's just do it all, shouldn't we?
[01:12:09.289 --> 01:12:14.450]  So that's the life of an InfoWars host, but let me just tell you, I'm honored to be here.
[01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:16.630]  I'm honored to be here.
[01:12:17.031 --> 01:12:22.872]  Better men have come before me, like Roger Stone, and better men have inspired me, and Roger's sitting here waiting patiently.
[01:12:22.912 --> 01:12:24.232]  I know he understands why I'm doing this.
[01:12:24.452 --> 01:12:25.453]  He's done this before himself.
[01:12:25.513 --> 01:12:44.971]   But folks, let me just say, I have watched men like Roger Stone, and Alex Jones, and Donald Trump, and Clay Clark, and Mike Flynn, and so many others, and when they're face down with this tyrannical government pursuing them and politically persecuting them, they never flinch, they never hesitate.
[01:12:45.011 --> 01:12:45.652]  So how could I?
[01:12:47.079 --> 01:12:51.826]  And you've never flinched in your support of my, of me and my legal fund either.
[01:12:52.066 --> 01:12:53.789]  And so I'm eternally grateful for that.
[01:12:53.849 --> 01:12:55.191]  So you're not going to see me cower.
[01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:57.033]  You're not going to see my knees shake.
[01:12:57.474 --> 01:13:00.398]  You're not going to see me, oh my gosh!
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:02.001]  It's not going to happen.
[01:13:03.427 --> 01:13:07.348]  So, I'm only more determined in the pursuit of freedom and truth.
[01:13:07.468 --> 01:13:12.068]  I'm only more committed to our mission of saving this country for future Americans.
[01:13:12.128 --> 01:13:13.129]  Because here's the thing, folks.
[01:13:13.849 --> 01:13:15.169]  This is a precedent-setting case.
[01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:20.650]  If they incarcerate me for my speech, and this is why we're appealing, and if this has to go to the Supreme Court, it will.
[01:13:21.190 --> 01:13:25.731]  If they can incarcerate Owen Schroer for his speech, then they can incarcerate you for your speech next.
[01:13:26.271 --> 01:13:28.531]  And so that's why this case is huge.
[01:13:30.152 --> 01:13:31.612]  So, DefendOwen.com.
[01:13:31.692 --> 01:13:32.592]  They want to come after me?
[01:13:33.871 --> 01:13:36.774]  That's what they're going to do, only because they want to come after you next.
[01:13:36.894 --> 01:13:38.395]  So please continue to support us.
[01:13:38.836 --> 01:13:39.857]  DefendOwen.com.
[01:13:39.977 --> 01:13:44.781]  My lawyer is busy today working on the appeal, dealing with the new documents we just got sent with my...
[01:13:46.081 --> 01:13:47.662]  Expect a date to turn myself in.
[01:13:48.722 --> 01:13:50.083]  So this is what you get folks.
[01:13:50.103 --> 01:13:51.844]  This is the most corrupt time in American history.
[01:13:52.384 --> 01:13:54.565]  Journalists have never been politically persecuted like this.
[01:13:55.045 --> 01:13:57.526]  Candidates have never been politically persecuted like this.
[01:13:58.787 --> 01:14:02.648]  Political pundits like Roger Stone have never been politically persecuted like this.
[01:14:02.728 --> 01:14:03.289]  But this is it.
[01:14:03.329 --> 01:14:04.889]  I mean, this is the evidence of the corruption.
[01:14:04.929 --> 01:14:06.930]  It's total vindication of everything we've talked about.
[01:14:08.431 --> 01:14:09.151]  That's what this is.
[01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:17.308]   So it's almost this weird Twilight Zone level where it's like, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist, but by the way, we are going to throw you in jail.
[01:14:17.328 --> 01:14:19.629]  It's like, hey, the government's really not that corrupt.
[01:14:19.849 --> 01:14:20.689]  Biden isn't really corrupt.
[01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:22.370]  There's no political persecution going on.
[01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:24.970]  But by the way, Schroyer, we're throwing your ass in jail for your speech.
[01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.230]  See?
[01:14:25.851 --> 01:14:27.231]  But see, there's no government corruption.
[01:14:28.031 --> 01:14:29.211]  So defend Owen.com.
[01:14:29.251 --> 01:14:30.692]  And folks, I'm banned everywhere.
[01:14:31.576 --> 01:14:45.695]  Okay, I'm one of the few men in the world that's still banned on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and everything else, but thanks to your support at InfoWarsTore.com, I've still got this platform, I can still do big interviews with guests like Roger Stone, so continue to support us at InfoWarsTore.com as well.
[01:14:45.756 --> 01:14:46.236]  Alright, Roger.
[01:14:47.262 --> 01:14:49.383]  I wanted to get into these latest political polls.
[01:14:49.563 --> 01:14:54.126]  I wanted to get into these latest political odds and some other news with you, but I've gone long here.
[01:14:54.186 --> 01:14:54.886]  I apologize.
[01:14:54.906 --> 01:14:55.807]  You're sitting there patiently.
[01:14:56.147 --> 01:14:57.568]  I mean, do you want to respond to this?
[01:14:57.668 --> 01:14:58.448]  I kind of want you to.
[01:14:58.488 --> 01:14:59.969]  You've been through the political ringer.
[01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:01.830]  You've been through the political persecution.
[01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:03.351]  You've been lied about by Democrats.
[01:15:03.831 --> 01:15:11.155]  I mean, you know, just talk to the audience about your experience with that and how important it is for Americans to stand strong because you inspired me, Roger.
[01:15:11.175 --> 01:15:12.116]  You never hesitated.
[01:15:12.476 --> 01:15:16.438]  Even when you were facing death in jail, you still told the truth.
[01:15:18.635 --> 01:15:32.240]  Well, Owen, I very distinctly remember standing with you in a cold hotel hallway, praying together the week of my trial, and you inspired me to hold fast to the truth.
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:39.683]  And I want you to know that not only am I, but every member of my family is praying for you now in this crucible.
[01:15:40.943 --> 01:15:49.505]  What's going on here, I think, is abundantly clear, but we really pray for your safety and we pray for justice in your case.
[01:15:50.126 --> 01:15:51.846]  You have stood up like a man.
[01:15:52.566 --> 01:16:07.630]  You refused to make up false testimony against others, as I did, and I'm convinced, regardless of how this turns out, you will emerge stronger and better for it and closer to the Lord.
[01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:10.592]  I know that liberals snicker.
[01:16:11.272 --> 01:16:16.035]  I know that elitists think it's a joke when I talk about my redemption in Jesus Christ.
[01:16:16.515 --> 01:16:16.895]  You know what?
[01:16:17.015 --> 01:16:18.236]  I don't really care what they think.
[01:16:18.736 --> 01:16:20.637]  I only care what he thinks.
[01:16:21.658 --> 01:16:26.860]   And he has a plan, and I don't think that plan includes the The destruction of America.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:49.064]   In fact, I think it actually includes an incredible reawakening of America because the more outrageous the deep state gets in their efforts to cancel the US Constitution, the more authoritarian they get, the more abusive they get, the more Americans wake So bless you in this moment.
[01:16:49.064 --> 01:16:54.083]   I understand it's a difficult time for you, but everyone in the Stone family,
[01:16:54.083 --> 01:16:58.083]   indeed all my friends, are praying that you will rise like a phoenix
[01:16:58.083 --> 01:17:02.943]   from the ashes, and the Lord will protect you in this moment.
[01:17:02.943 --> 01:17:05.224]   Well, I love that, Roger, and it means everything,
[01:17:05.224 --> 01:17:07.364]   and I've just, you know, like I said,
[01:17:07.364 --> 01:17:11.545]   I feel like the richest man, I feel like the wealthiest man,
[01:17:11.545 --> 01:17:14.423]   or the wealthiest I've ever been, not because of the status of my bank account,
[01:17:14.423 --> 01:17:18.904]   it's not really impressive, but because of all the friends,
[01:17:18.904 --> 01:17:21.345]   and all the family, and all the words of encouragement,
[01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:25.664]   and the prayers that I know are coming my way, it makes me feel like the wealthiest man,
[01:17:25.664 --> 01:17:28.503]   and so that just gives me the confidence to walk with my.
[01:17:28.635 --> 01:17:38.171]  Head held high, and know that the Lord is with me, that our Divine Creator is here, and that He has a plan for all of this, and so it's just, again...
[01:17:39.312 --> 01:17:41.034]  Folks, I mean this sincerely.
[01:17:41.174 --> 01:17:53.967]  If I didn't have the men coming before me to inspire me, like Roger Stone, and Alex Jones, and Donald Trump, and all the other men I mentioned, and all the other men that have not even hesitated dealing with this tyranny, then I wouldn't have that example set.
[01:17:54.007 --> 01:17:59.572]  So, you know, I've kind of coined this phrase, and I hope that it pays forward to the future generations of Americans.
[01:18:00.513 --> 01:18:04.716]  Better men have come before me, and I challenge better men to come after me.
[01:18:05.957 --> 01:18:08.259]  Roger, I want to get into this on the other side.
[01:18:08.299 --> 01:18:11.142]  We'll actually get back into the political coverage here with the poll numbers.
[01:18:11.702 --> 01:18:17.687]  But just final words in closing, how important it is that we get this next election right.
[01:18:19.216 --> 01:18:21.657]  This is, as Donald Trump put it, the final battle.
[01:18:22.358 --> 01:18:23.818]  And look, there's two parts of this.
[01:18:23.838 --> 01:18:24.679]  I think we all know it.
[01:18:25.079 --> 01:18:30.822]  Donald Trump can go into election day with a massive lead, and he can still be cheated out of the presidency.
[01:18:31.222 --> 01:18:34.424]  We have not yet grappled with the question of election integrity.
[01:18:34.784 --> 01:18:39.146]  We need to ensure that the next elections are free, fair, honest, and transparent.
[01:18:39.546 --> 01:18:40.607]  Some say it is too late.
[01:18:40.788 --> 01:18:54.343]  It is not too late, but everything must be done properly, legally and technologically to ensure that Trump's massive lead is not buried in a blizzard of fake ballots and mail-in ballots and so on.
[01:18:54.343 --> 01:18:56.324]  Back here on the Alex Jones Show with Roger Stone.
[01:18:56.144 --> 01:19:00.943]   victory because this is indeed the final battle. We'll talk about it on the other
[01:19:00.943 --> 01:19:04.743]  side. In the meantime, lawyers are very expensive folks.
[01:19:04.743 --> 01:19:09.583]   Owen Schroer really needs your support. I've been in his position. Please go to
[01:19:09.583 --> 01:19:10.844]  his legal defense fund.
[01:19:10.844 --> 01:19:18.463]   Back here on the Alex Jones show with Roger Stone. Now Roger, obviously
[01:19:18.463 --> 01:19:23.543]  the poll numbers are all favoring Trump.
[01:19:21.982 --> 01:19:24.785]  I don't know how they haven't always favored Trump.
[01:19:24.945 --> 01:19:34.634]  I'm kind of of the belief that polls are propaganda and now the reason why they want them all to show that Trump can beat Biden is because the Democrats want to get rid of Biden.
[01:19:36.158 --> 01:19:47.746]  You know, the Vegas Oddsmakers always seem to have the inside baseball, they always seem to have their finger to the pulse, whether it's sports or politics, and they do still have Donald Trump and Joe Biden neck and neck.
[01:19:47.886 --> 01:20:00.515]  But, they have Gavin Newsom as the number three candidate right now, ahead of Robert Kennedy Jr., Michelle Obama, Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, and the list goes on from there.
[01:20:00.915 --> 01:20:06.459]   We also have Sean Hannity, who's going to be hosting a debate with DeSantis, And Newsom.
[01:20:07.241 --> 01:20:08.603]  What do you think is the strategy here?
[01:20:08.623 --> 01:20:10.726]  I don't think any of this is coincidence.
[01:20:11.167 --> 01:20:16.255]  To me, this just shows that the political establishment wants DeSantis and Newsom in the race.
[01:20:16.936 --> 01:20:19.219]  I guess whether it's for president or vice president.
[01:20:19.239 --> 01:20:20.682]  But what do you think about that?
[01:20:22.459 --> 01:20:23.721]  I think it's going to be interesting.
[01:20:23.801 --> 01:20:26.123]  For Ron DeSantis, it's a Hail Mary pass.
[01:20:26.223 --> 01:20:28.986]  I mean, his candidacy is literally collapsing.
[01:20:29.526 --> 01:20:39.296]  The latest polls in New Hampshire show that he has dropped from a high of 42 at one point to now about 10% of the vote, vying for a fourth place finish.
[01:20:40.157 --> 01:20:52.184]   His campaign has collapsed in every state because there is no rationale of running, the original rationale, was that when Trump was
[01:20:52.184 --> 01:20:56.823]   charged in these various states with these fabricated crimes, his money would dry up, his
[01:20:56.823 --> 01:21:00.583]   support would collapse, and his candidacy would be over.
[01:21:00.583 --> 01:21:02.743]  It's been the exact opposite of that.
[01:21:02.743 --> 01:21:08.864]   The attack on Trump, the tsunami of lawfare, has turbocharged his candidacy.
[01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:10.824]  So there is no rationale.
[01:21:10.824 --> 01:21:16.743]   Additionally, the truth is Ron DeSantis is in trouble back here in Florida.
[01:21:17.115 --> 01:21:18.576]  We have an insurance crisis.
[01:21:18.996 --> 01:21:20.998]  We have a malaria crisis.
[01:21:21.839 --> 01:21:24.221]  We have a rising crime crisis.
[01:21:24.921 --> 01:21:25.822]  And where's the governor?
[01:21:25.902 --> 01:21:26.823]  Oh, he's in Iowa.
[01:21:27.203 --> 01:21:34.449]  So I think this is a high profile opportunity for him to try to somehow reboot his campaign.
[01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:36.071]  This will be the fifth reboot.
[01:21:36.531 --> 01:21:57.732]  In the case of Gavin Newsom, I think this is an opportunity to showcase himself because even he cannot be blind to the fact that his fellow Democrats realize that Joe Biden is a stone-cold loser, that he cannot possibly get through a debate with Donald Trump, never mind an election campaign.
[01:21:58.392 --> 01:22:16.517]  And therefore, this is a way for Gavin Newsom, while pretending to be loyal to Biden, which he continues to pretend to be, to showcase himself and advertise his availability in the event that the reach for Michelle Obama, who has never held public office, is too great.
[01:22:16.937 --> 01:22:19.058]  So these guys both want to be president.
[01:22:20.158 --> 01:22:23.339]  I think one of them has a long-term prospect of being president.
[01:22:23.579 --> 01:22:24.739]  That would be Gavin Newsom.
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:43.574]   I think Ron DeSantis has He has damaged his brand incredibly just through the mere act of treachery and backstabbing of running against the man who elevated him from being a complete political unknown to the governorship of one of the most powerful states in the country.
[01:22:44.014 --> 01:22:46.917]  So this debate is going to be very interesting.
[01:22:47.998 --> 01:22:53.342]  I don't really know how Gavin Newsom can defend his record in California.
[01:22:53.442 --> 01:22:54.984]  It is a record of disaster.
[01:22:55.384 --> 01:23:03.182]  On the other hand, I think he's going to go after Ron DeSantis on the growingly obvious corruption that's going on in Florida.
[01:23:03.894 --> 01:23:18.318]  When Ron DeSantis, for example, takes $9.5 million from Florida Power and Light and their subsidiaries, and the people of Florida get a 22% increase in our electricity rates, that kind of reeks of corruption, wouldn't you say?
[01:23:18.838 --> 01:23:43.986]   Or when Ron DeSantis takes $4.5 million from the insurance industry, and a law is passed that says if your home was destroyed in the recent hurricane, Or either one of the recent hurricanes, and you don't like the offer of your home insurance company because it won't cover the cost of the replacement of your roof or your entire home, you can no longer sue the insurance company under a law signed by Ron DeSantis.
[01:23:44.366 --> 01:23:46.207]  I just give you those two examples.
[01:23:46.287 --> 01:23:51.089]  So it's going to be very interesting to see what both of these individuals have to say in the debate.
[01:23:51.489 --> 01:23:55.970]  When it comes to just the record, clearly DeSantis has an advantage.
[01:23:56.410 --> 01:24:06.700]   On the other hand, Gavin Newsom is much better on television, more telegenic, seems to actually, despite the fact I don't like his politics, seems to actually have a personality.
[01:24:07.625 --> 01:24:33.369]   Yeah, it's really, I mean, I certainly don't have the, let's say, vitriol towards Ron DeSantis that you may have, but there's no doubt either he lacked the political savvy to not get in bed with the Bush wing of the Republican Party and to not run against Donald Trump, or he took bad advice, and now it seems, not just that his political career is shot in my view, but it's like, Any charisma he had is completely shot.
[01:24:33.509 --> 01:24:38.792]  It's like he knows everybody looks at him as a phony now, and so I don't see... It's too bad, too, because you said it.
[01:24:38.912 --> 01:24:42.493]  How do you even compare and contrast the state of California to the state of Florida?
[01:24:42.513 --> 01:24:44.955]  I mean, California is hemorrhaging people.
[01:24:44.995 --> 01:24:46.175]  They can't leave fast enough.
[01:24:46.575 --> 01:24:49.096]  Meanwhile, people are moving to Florida like their life depends on it.
[01:24:49.697 --> 01:24:51.257]  And maybe if they're leaving California, it does.
[01:24:51.838 --> 01:24:57.360]  And, I mean, California is set to lose even more electoral votes at this rate, and Florida gain more.
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:00.442]   And on that issue, I want to bring this to your attention.
[01:25:00.482 --> 01:25:07.707]  Now, Frank Luntz tweeted this out, and so you know he loves propping up what the Democrats want to do, what the deep state wants to do.
[01:25:08.927 --> 01:25:14.251]  65% of Americans want presidential elections to be decided by a nationwide popular vote.
[01:25:14.431 --> 01:25:15.992]  33% want to keep the electoral college.
[01:25:16.312 --> 01:25:17.433]  This is from Pew Research.
[01:25:17.933 --> 01:25:21.015]  Majority of Americans continue to favor moving away from Electoral College.
[01:25:21.035 --> 01:25:29.419]  Well, this just shows to me that the American people are ignorant on what the Electoral College really does and how genius it actually is.
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:34.322]  But this is kind of the Democrat Party pipe dream in a way, Roger.
[01:25:34.382 --> 01:25:36.963]  This is how they can accomplish their one-party state.
[01:25:37.484 --> 01:25:51.438]   Now, It might be too aggressive or too early for them to try to move from this, but do you think if they see that their political party is a dying breed that they might just go full out to try to end the Electoral College?
[01:25:52.729 --> 01:25:54.030]  I think it's entirely possible.
[01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:59.535]  Look, having the president elected by popular vote puts an absolute premium on voter fraud.
[01:26:00.035 --> 01:26:07.581]  The founding fathers were geniuses when they devised a system that protected the smaller states and made them equal to the larger states.
[01:26:08.102 --> 01:26:11.945]  When I said recently in a video that Article 2 of the U.S.
[01:26:12.005 --> 01:26:18.484]   Constitution gives grants to the state legislatures the authority to award the electoral votes
[01:26:18.484 --> 01:26:23.704]   to a presidential candidate based on the popular vote within the state, I was accused by the
[01:26:23.704 --> 01:26:26.923]  folks at MSNBC of advocating fake electors.
[01:26:26.923 --> 01:26:29.965]  I never said anything about fake electors.
[01:26:29.965 --> 01:26:36.524]   What I said is historically, legally, and constitutionally correct.
[01:26:36.529 --> 01:26:38.890]  So I support the electoral college system.
[01:26:39.230 --> 01:26:41.951]  I think it has worked for this nation since 1776.
[01:26:42.451 --> 01:26:43.391]  It works today.
[01:26:44.451 --> 01:26:55.495]  It is not a perfect system, but I guarantee you I would not like to leave the election of the president to these corrupt urban machines in places like Chicago and Los Angeles and New York.
[01:26:55.996 --> 01:27:02.738]  No presidential candidate would visit a small or medium-sized state under any other scenario.
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:07.373]  And we would be at the mercy of those who steal votes by the hundred thousand.
[01:27:08.112 --> 01:27:17.238]  And then you become at the mercy of New York City and Los Angeles or San Francisco and these population dense areas, Chicago, and then no other votes matter.
[01:27:17.278 --> 01:27:27.025]  I mean, folks, when you look at the breakdown of a political or electoral map, whether it's by district, by county, by state, you'll find, well, most of the map is red.
[01:27:27.365 --> 01:27:28.185]  Well, exactly.
[01:27:28.245 --> 01:27:35.330]  That's why the Democrats want to get rid of the Electoral College so that they can dominate every vote with four or five populous areas.
[01:27:35.911 --> 01:27:37.912]  One more question for you, Roger, before we let you go.
[01:27:39.093 --> 01:27:45.417]  Tulsi Gabbard slams Democrats for abuse of power in pursuit of Trump, turning America into a banana republic.
[01:27:45.437 --> 01:27:48.079]  Now, you talk to people from all different political backgrounds.
[01:27:48.099 --> 01:27:50.001]  You've been involved in politics for a long time.
[01:27:50.721 --> 01:27:54.664]  Is this the attitude of a lot of classical Democrat liberals?
[01:27:54.744 --> 01:28:00.469]  Is this the attitude of Democrat voters who have just been voting Democrat because they're anti-war or pro-civil rights?
[01:28:01.741 --> 01:28:06.065]  I mean, I don't think it's just Tulsi Gabbard and some of these others that are switching party affiliation.
[01:28:06.505 --> 01:28:10.228]  To me, this has to strike right to the core of the Democrat Party.
[01:28:10.248 --> 01:28:12.550]  They have to know that this is how people feel.
[01:28:13.769 --> 01:28:19.315]  Well, just like in the Republican Party, there's a major disconnect between the party leadership and the grassroots of the party.
[01:28:19.675 --> 01:28:21.777]  I still think that's true in the Democratic Party.
[01:28:22.118 --> 01:28:36.273]  The Democratic Party leadership is now controlled by ultra-progressive socialists, if not communists or Marxists, but there are still some working-class, patriotic, pro-capitalist Americans in the Democratic Party.
[01:28:36.693 --> 01:28:40.998]  They have gravitated so far to the candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy.
[01:28:41.659 --> 01:28:50.149]  They're going to be denied the option to vote for him in the general election, in my opinion, because their process is completely and totally rigged against him.
[01:28:50.169 --> 01:28:52.371]  But where do those Kennedy voters go?
[01:28:53.212 --> 01:28:54.453]  They don't go to Joe Biden.
[01:28:54.834 --> 01:29:00.840]  They don't go to Gavin Newsom or Michelle Obama or whoever replaces Joe Biden.
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:09.228]  I think that they are potentially Trump voters and therefore the Kennedy candidacy could still have an enormous impact on this election.
[01:29:09.689 --> 01:29:13.492]  Well yeah, I mean we've got some Kennedy supporters right here in the crew and I don't blame them for it.
[01:29:14.373 --> 01:29:19.618]  I mean, I won't speak for them, but my guess is if they had to choose between Trump or some other Democrat, they'd probably go with Trump.
[01:29:19.638 --> 01:29:20.859]  They might vote Kennedy third party.
[01:29:21.179 --> 01:29:25.403]  But do you think Kennedy might run third party or even become Trump's vice president?
[01:29:25.483 --> 01:29:26.404]  Final word, Roger Stone.
[01:29:27.765 --> 01:29:30.507]  That's a very tough question to answer quickly, but let me try.
[01:29:30.627 --> 01:29:36.072]  Getting on the ballot as an independent is an incredibly time-intensive, labor-intensive... But what about Trump's VP?
[01:29:36.112 --> 01:29:36.552]  Yes or no?
[01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:41.953]   I'd like to see it, but there are a lot of legal obstacles and political obstacles.
[01:29:41.953 --> 01:29:55.953]  [Music]
[01:29:55.953 --> 01:30:01.953]   My fellow patriots, the Trafecta has not been in stock for years.

[01:30:54.792 --> 01:30:55.513]  and it keeps us on air.
[01:30:56.513 --> 01:31:02.113]   Alright, I put Roger Stone up against it though, so he's agreed to answer the question here in this segment.
[01:31:02.113 --> 01:31:09.113]   So let me just put it out like this, Cornel West running third party, that's costing the Democrats votes.
[01:31:09.113 --> 01:31:10.913]  If RFKG...
[01:31:10.967 --> 01:31:11.327]  Jr.
[01:31:11.387 --> 01:31:14.489]  or Tulsi Gabbard run third party, that would cost them more votes.
[01:31:14.529 --> 01:31:16.751]  But more specifically, R.F.K.
[01:31:16.771 --> 01:31:17.051]  Jr.
[01:31:17.091 --> 01:31:18.092]  as Trump's vice president.
[01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:19.993]  To me, that is the ultimate card.
[01:31:20.373 --> 01:31:22.295]  To me, that is a card that can't lose.
[01:31:22.795 --> 01:31:27.278]  And if it somehow magically did lose, I think most Americans would say, okay, what the hell's going on?
[01:31:27.339 --> 01:31:28.659]  So, R.F.K.
[01:31:28.679 --> 01:31:30.881]  Jr., Donald Trump's vice president.
[01:31:30.981 --> 01:31:31.862]  Roger, what do you think?
[01:31:32.932 --> 01:31:34.272]  Here's the problem, Owen.
[01:31:34.653 --> 01:31:44.156]  30 states have state laws that require if you're going to be the nominee of the Republican Party for any federal office, you have to be a registered member of that party.
[01:31:44.616 --> 01:31:51.638]  I don't see Robert F. Kennedy ever leaving the party of his father, the party of his uncle, John F. Kennedy.
[01:31:53.119 --> 01:31:56.760]  That would not preclude him from potentially running as an independent.
[01:31:57.140 --> 01:32:12.692]   But the process of getting on the ballot as an independent In enough states to theoretically win 270 electoral votes, as I said, is an incredibly complex, expensive, manpower intensive, and arcane process.
[01:32:13.173 --> 01:32:17.997]  And if Kennedy is going to try this, he cannot wait until next August.
[01:32:18.017 --> 01:32:23.262]  This idea that you can withdraw from the democratic process and easily run as an independent is not accurate.
[01:32:23.282 --> 01:32:26.824]   So he would have to make that decision Relatively soon.
[01:32:27.265 --> 01:32:48.691]  Now, the great political coalition that you talk about of bringing Kennedy, Democrats, and independents into the Trump coalition could be achieved more simply by President Trump pledging that if he's elected, he would make Robert Kennedy, say, Attorney General, with a charge of cleaning up the deep state and investigating the last pandemic.
[01:32:49.091 --> 01:33:00.697]  I'm making it very clear that when it comes to important issues like the Second Amendment or abortion that public policy is set not by the Attorney General but set by the President of the United States.
[01:33:01.097 --> 01:33:21.461]   I think that would be just as effective without all the legal obstacles Uh, involved in trying to get him on the ticket for vice president, not to mention the difficulty of shoving Robert Kennedy down the throat of the Republican National Convention, which no matter how popular Donald Trump is among those delegates, and he will be ultra popular, would still be exceedingly difficult.
[01:33:22.193 --> 01:33:42.263]   So this is kind of unprecedented in politics, but Trump would literally, and I guess maybe part of the RNC at least, it's not going to be Ronna Romney McDaniel, I guess in this case I hope she would keep silent and hidden as the fake leadership she is, but Do you think Trump could put politics aside and say, hey, yes, I want to put RFK Jr.
[01:33:42.303 --> 01:33:47.025]  as a part of my cabinet, maybe in whatever, whether it's Attorney General or this, that, or the other thing.
[01:33:47.686 --> 01:33:53.608]  And I would even say reaching out in olive branch to Vivek Ramaswamy and saying, hey, I like what you're talking about with the administrative state.
[01:33:53.688 --> 01:33:54.949]  Let's give you a shot to prove.
[01:33:55.849 --> 01:33:57.970]  Uh, and earn some political capital here.
[01:33:58.030 --> 01:34:02.812]  I'm going to put you in charge of the new committee to drain the administrative state.
[01:34:02.892 --> 01:34:08.594]  Do you think Trump could kind of put politics aside in that unprecedented way to build the coalition?
[01:34:09.755 --> 01:34:12.717]  Well, there's a long tradition of having bipartisan cabinets.
[01:34:12.777 --> 01:34:14.518]  John F. Kennedy, Secretary of Treasury.
[01:34:14.878 --> 01:34:17.520]  C. Douglas Dillon was a Republican from New Jersey.
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:23.643]  Richard Nixon, Secretary of the Treasury, was a former Governor John Connolly of Texas.
[01:34:23.683 --> 01:34:28.726]  He later became a Republican, but when he served in the cabinet, he was still a Democrat.
[01:34:29.167 --> 01:34:35.127]   the secretary of transportation in the Obama administration, former Republican
[01:34:35.127 --> 01:34:37.446]  Congressman Ray LaHood of Illinois.
[01:34:37.446 --> 01:34:41.207]   So there's a long tradition of bipartisanship within the cabinet.
[01:34:41.207 --> 01:34:44.207]  So I don't think Trump would have a real issue with it.
[01:34:44.207 --> 01:34:48.807]   As far as Vivek Ramaswamy, I'd like to see him tested in, say,
[01:34:48.807 --> 01:34:50.967]  as secretary of commerce, for example.
[01:34:50.967 --> 01:34:52.247]  I like his rhetoric.
[01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:55.171]  I'm troubled by some of the things that are in his background.
[01:34:55.791 --> 01:34:56.992]  He's very, very glib.
[01:34:57.032 --> 01:34:58.212]  He's very articulate.
[01:34:58.232 --> 01:35:03.155]  It bothers me that he kind of got caught plagiarizing a couple of Barack Obama's speeches.
[01:35:03.555 --> 01:35:06.656]  I would like to believe he's real, but I have a lot of questions.
[01:35:06.796 --> 01:35:07.457]  It doesn't matter.
[01:35:07.637 --> 01:35:10.178]  I'm for Donald Trump first, last, and always.
[01:35:11.218 --> 01:35:12.338]  All right, there it is.
[01:35:12.658 --> 01:35:13.679]  Roger Stone.
[01:35:14.159 --> 01:35:17.540]  Political mastermind and expertise unlike any other.
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:19.921]  Final question for you, Roger, here.
[01:35:20.761 --> 01:35:22.902]  Do you think I could pull off that hat you have on?
[01:35:24.642 --> 01:35:25.703]  It's kind of ironic.
[01:35:25.763 --> 01:35:30.684]  I titted myself out in all of my Infowars gear today just because I knew it was going to be on with you.
[01:35:30.764 --> 01:35:31.744]  But you know what?
[01:35:31.804 --> 01:35:35.025]  If you send me your hat size, I will send you a hat like this.
[01:35:35.386 --> 01:35:36.566]  Keeps the sun off your head.
[01:35:37.521 --> 01:35:39.702]  Roger Stone is going to offer me a hat?
[01:35:40.122 --> 01:35:41.782]  Oh my gosh, well now I've got to find out.
[01:35:41.822 --> 01:35:44.803]  I don't know if I can pull it off as good as you, Roger, but now I've got to give it a try.
[01:35:44.823 --> 01:35:45.623]  The great Roger Stone.
[01:35:45.683 --> 01:35:46.784]  StoneZone.com.
[01:35:48.024 --> 01:35:52.525]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, here we are in the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:52.725 --> 01:35:54.606]  My head hat size has been measured.
[01:35:57.810 --> 01:36:01.571]  You know, we've seen a lot of great hats in American political history.
[01:36:02.011 --> 01:36:02.912]  We've seen some great hats.
[01:36:03.332 --> 01:36:05.712]  But I think Roger Stone has the best hat.
[01:36:05.932 --> 01:36:07.253]  And we've had some good hats.
[01:36:07.293 --> 01:36:08.713]  We've had some good Trump hats, too.
[01:36:08.753 --> 01:36:09.794]  Let's not forget about the red hat.
[01:36:09.814 --> 01:36:10.794]  We've never seen a Biden hat.
[01:36:11.294 --> 01:36:13.995]  But if Roger Stone offers you a hat, you have to take it.
[01:36:14.475 --> 01:36:16.016]  It's just, you have to take it, folks.
[01:36:16.176 --> 01:36:16.836]  It's guaranteed.
[01:36:17.156 --> 01:36:17.756]  You gotta count it.
[01:36:18.356 --> 01:36:39.403]  Roger Stone's hat someday will be in the Smithsonian Museum, and maybe if we could extract a little bit of DNA from Roger Stone's hat, and maybe clone a Roger Stone, and we could maybe then have a political mastermind forever, but you look at that hat, and I mean, maybe there's only one hat better in politics with a red hat, but I don't know, that's a pretty strong hat right there.
[01:36:39.423 --> 01:36:40.163]  I think I want one.
[01:36:41.633 --> 01:36:43.953]  All right, all jokes aside, ladies and gentlemen, here we are.
[01:36:44.594 --> 01:36:56.796]  Now, I've still got a lot of other news that I'm going to start covering, but please cherish InfoWars.
[01:36:58.116 --> 01:37:02.277]  Please cherish the work that has been put in here for decades.
[01:37:02.897 --> 01:37:03.897]  I know I certainly do.
[01:37:04.917 --> 01:37:20.903]   And please cherish our crew and our guests as well, because this is the mothership Of fighting against the lies in the media, the lies from our government, corruption in the media, corruption in government.
[01:37:21.003 --> 01:37:23.024]  This is the mothership and fighting against that.
[01:37:23.424 --> 01:37:28.087]  And so as you see, we live in the most corrupt times perhaps in American history.
[01:37:29.587 --> 01:37:33.810]  You see the persecution and the attacks on InfoWars are greater than ever.
[01:37:34.290 --> 01:37:39.373]  So, really it's the total vindication of all of our work, quite frankly.
[01:37:40.376 --> 01:37:53.608]  The continued persecution and everything you've seen, the attacks on InfoWars for the last, I mean, really harder than ever starting in 2018 with the complete ban of InfoWars and Alex Jones, and then most of our guests and hosts getting hit with it as well, including myself.
[01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:56.811]  And then the lawfare, and now the incarcerations.
[01:37:57.292 --> 01:38:00.014]  I mean, it's total vindication of everything we've talked about.
[01:38:00.635 --> 01:38:11.455]  And so it's kind of ironic in a way, all the people that call us conspiracy theorists, and then they laugh at all the persecution we go through, even though it's the total vindication of all of the work that we've ever done here.
[01:38:13.581 --> 01:38:21.543]  So allow us to keep doing it by shopping at Infowarestore.com and I can tell you the products at Infowarestore.com are truly top-notch.
[01:38:21.663 --> 01:38:28.545]  I'm a product of the products at Infowarestore.com and the trifecta pack that we have going 40% off right now, this is the elite of the elite.
[01:38:28.925 --> 01:38:33.326]  Bodies for flexibility support, joint support, achiness, soreness.
[01:38:33.906 --> 01:38:35.106]  I love to go to bodies.

[01:38:42.128 --> 01:38:51.533]  In the Real Red Pill Plus, which works great with DNA Force Plus, with the CoQ10 and the PQQ for cellular energy production and telomere support.
[01:38:51.653 --> 01:39:01.159]  It's the InfoWars Life Trifecta Pack, 40% off, limited time, while supplies last, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:39:01.179 --> 01:39:08.483]  We cannot thank you for your support enough, and it's your continued support at InfoWarsStore.com that keeps us on the air.
[01:39:09.463 --> 01:39:10.284]  But there's a reason.
[01:39:11.223 --> 01:39:16.185]  There's a reason why the enemies of truth and the enemies of America hate us so much and want us off the air.
[01:39:16.605 --> 01:39:23.729]  And so we've never been more vindicated in our work, and that's why we have never been attacked in such a way as we are today.
[01:39:24.689 --> 01:39:25.069]  All right.
[01:39:26.110 --> 01:39:35.154]  Let's just, let me go to some video clips here, and we shall get back into the news.
[01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:39.802]  First, more from this 60 Minutes interview.
[01:39:39.842 --> 01:39:50.907]  Now Alex covered it earlier, how Justin Trudeau is now blaming the Speaker of Parliament on bringing in the Nazi and then saying it was the Russians and it was Russian disinformation.
[01:39:53.128 --> 01:40:00.792]  When most people believe it was actually he that did that to support their efforts in Ukraine and the funding of the war in Ukraine.
[01:40:03.051 --> 01:40:04.113]  And we played the clip yesterday.
[01:40:04.133 --> 01:40:07.117]  I mean, clearly the speaker, it was almost like he didn't even know what was going on.
[01:40:07.137 --> 01:40:09.240]  And then when he was reading the script, I mean, we broke it down.
[01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:11.663]  His body language indicates that even he was stunned.
[01:40:11.683 --> 01:40:13.105]  He was like, wait, he fought the Russians?
[01:40:14.106 --> 01:40:15.388]  Wait, was this guy a Nazi?
[01:40:15.648 --> 01:40:17.190]  It's like, that's what his body language is reading.
[01:40:17.210 --> 01:40:20.294]  And then Trudeau throws him under the bus for something he probably did.
[01:40:21.616 --> 01:40:26.561]  You had more there on this 60 Minutes piece where they're promoting the war.
[01:40:27.142 --> 01:40:30.385]  And it's nice, isn't it nice when Democrats and Republicans work together?
[01:40:30.725 --> 01:40:35.170]  It only seems to be for one cause, death and destruction, aka war.
[01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:37.912]  And so here's Senator Blumenthal and Senator...
[01:40:38.638 --> 01:40:39.519]  Lindsey Graham!
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:54.316]  And here they are in the 60-minute special telling you how important it is to support the war in Ukraine and then telling you that they are tracking and following every dime and every piece of equipment even though both of them voted against just that in clip three.
[01:40:55.359 --> 01:41:00.123]  While in Kiev, we learned that three of McCain's former colleagues were also in town.
[01:41:00.683 --> 01:41:06.348]  Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal, and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.
[01:41:07.128 --> 01:41:08.990]  They don't normally agree on much.
[01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:14.574]  Together, though, they're some of the staunchest supporters of US funding for Ukraine's resistance.
[01:41:15.235 --> 01:41:17.777]  They're on track to break the Russian army.
[01:41:18.857 --> 01:41:23.181]  And the only way they could possibly lose is if we pull the plug on them.
[01:41:23.837 --> 01:41:29.318]  The wreckage of Russia's war machine was on display for Ukraine's Independence Day celebrations.
[01:41:30.058 --> 01:41:33.619]  Even as almost a fifth of the country remains under occupation.
[01:41:34.359 --> 01:41:36.040]  People ask me, is it worth it?
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:43.741]  This level of propaganda is truly stunning, folks.
[01:41:43.821 --> 01:41:46.722]  I mean, you're witnessing history propaganda here.
[01:41:46.762 --> 01:41:47.722]  This is historic stuff.
[01:41:48.902 --> 01:41:51.163]  They roll out tanks that the Russians have destroyed.
[01:41:52.082 --> 01:41:55.845]  They admit that the Russians' incursion into Ukraine has not been stopped.
[01:41:56.406 --> 01:42:00.389]  They admit that if it wasn't for the support of America, Ukraine wouldn't have a chance.
[01:42:00.850 --> 01:42:03.672]  And then they tell you how Ukraine's winning and everything's good, so keep funding it.
[01:42:05.534 --> 01:42:11.299]  Honestly, only... only... I wouldn't even say a simpleton, because I'm not trying to insult simpletons.
[01:42:11.559 --> 01:42:14.822]  But, like, only a moron wouldn't see through this.
[01:42:15.808 --> 01:42:16.389]  Only a month.
[01:42:16.869 --> 01:42:34.583]  Yeah, if it wasn't for our support, Ukraine would be winning, and here's all the destroyed equipment that we've sent to Ukraine that just gets destroyed as soon as it shows up on the battlefield, and the Russians have pretty much taken every part of Ukraine they wanted, and we can't get it back, and if it wasn't for our support, it'd all be over, but we're doing great, and they're winning, and it's so good, so let's keep fighting it.
[01:42:34.623 --> 01:42:35.484]  I mean, what?
[01:42:36.124 --> 01:42:36.525]  Continue.
[01:42:37.943 --> 01:42:40.024]  We haven't lost one soldier.
[01:42:40.824 --> 01:42:43.846]  We reduced the combat power of the Russian army by 50%.
[01:42:44.606 --> 01:42:47.407]  Not one of us has died in that endeavor.
[01:42:47.427 --> 01:42:49.688]  This is a great deal for America.
[01:42:50.028 --> 01:42:53.569]  You've previously said that it's the best money we've ever spent.
[01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:54.290]  That's still true?
[01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.510]  Disgusting.
[01:42:54.530 --> 01:42:57.211]  Since we helped Churchill stand up to the Nazis.
[01:42:57.779 --> 01:43:04.500]  We have to have confidence that the dollars we're spending are actually being spent in defense of the nation.
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:06.141]  All of that is important.
[01:43:06.161 --> 01:43:07.161]  So they vote against oversight?
[01:43:07.261 --> 01:43:08.481]  That's why we're here.
[01:43:09.041 --> 01:43:17.323]  The senators and other US officials told us there are no substantiated cases of American weapons being diverted.
[01:43:17.903 --> 01:43:21.203]  The United States Department of Defense ought to be telling the story about oversight.
[01:43:21.603 --> 01:43:24.984]  We're monitoring, we're following every piece of equipment.
[01:43:25.632 --> 01:43:28.256]  There has been no diversion, no evidence of misappropriation.
[01:43:28.276 --> 01:43:28.756]  These are ghouls.
[01:43:28.776 --> 01:43:34.905]  This is an American success story on aiding a partner fighting for freedom.
[01:43:35.293 --> 01:43:37.375]  Let's just do this, because we don't talk here.
[01:43:37.395 --> 01:43:44.100]  I mean, most of the audience probably knows that we're telling the truth, and I just know this because I'm on Air Coverage News every day.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:47.383]  But let's just do this in the last 80 seconds here, guys.
[01:43:47.823 --> 01:43:48.444]  Just search.
[01:43:49.044 --> 01:43:50.745]  I mean, there's a dozen things you could search.
[01:43:50.825 --> 01:43:55.789]  Rand Paul decries Congress voting against monitoring money to Ukraine.
[01:43:55.869 --> 01:43:58.592]  Congress votes against oversight to money in Ukraine.
[01:43:58.652 --> 01:44:00.733]  Congress votes against oversight for weapons in Ukraine.
[01:44:01.014 --> 01:44:02.735]  I mean, guys, just pull up a bunch of stories on here.
[01:44:05.441 --> 01:44:14.784]  So these damn ghouls, who have never seen a war, they didn't want someone else to die in, and then they get funding from the contractors.
[01:44:15.204 --> 01:44:17.004]  I mean, it's right here in the news again today.
[01:44:17.444 --> 01:44:22.646]  Adam Schiff funneled millions to defense contractors after taking donations from defense contractors.
[01:44:23.578 --> 01:44:24.598]  Yeah, so here it is.
[01:44:25.319 --> 01:44:28.600]  So, and Rand Paul was the only person trying to stop it.
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:36.744]  Yeah guys, so there's Rand Paul trying to stop the money to Ukraine without any oversight, and then plug in Congress votes against oversight to Ukraine.
[01:44:36.764 --> 01:44:39.025]  You can find hundreds of news stories on that too.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:43.761]  And so these ghouls, they all vote against oversight.
[01:44:44.422 --> 01:44:47.363]  They all voted against oversight in the money and the weapons to Ukraine.
[01:44:47.683 --> 01:44:51.525]  And then they go on 60 minutes and they say, we have oversight!
[01:44:51.585 --> 01:44:58.368]  And it's important for the American people to have confidence that their dollars are getting spent and the weapons are being overseen by the Department of Defense.
[01:44:58.708 --> 01:45:02.430]  And then every single one of them voted against the oversight.
[01:45:03.618 --> 01:45:05.540]  Why do we have such corrupt people in our government?
[01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:06.160]  It's stunning.
[01:45:06.941 --> 01:45:09.443]  Alright, it's officially the clown world now.
[01:45:09.923 --> 01:45:11.224]  And, uh, I don't know.
[01:45:11.464 --> 01:45:12.685]  Maybe Elon Musk is right.
[01:45:12.725 --> 01:45:14.927]  Maybe the only option is to move to Mars at this point.
[01:45:15.407 --> 01:45:21.392]  Because these freaks that run our governments are just completely whacked out of their minds.
[01:45:23.894 --> 01:45:33.161]  The Canadian Speaker of the House, Anthony Rota, has now resigned because of the applause for the Nazi.
[01:45:34.807 --> 01:45:35.888]  It's just like, what?
[01:45:35.908 --> 01:45:43.172]  I mean, here's the statement.
[01:45:44.187 --> 01:45:51.709]  I reiterate my profound regret for my error in recognizing an individual in the House during the joint address to Parliament of President Zelensky.
[01:45:52.129 --> 01:45:58.930]  That public recognition has caused pain to individuals and communities, including the Jewish community in Canada and around the world.
[01:45:59.210 --> 01:46:05.611]  In addition to the survivors of Nazi atrocities in Poland, among other nations, I accept full responsibility for my actions.
[01:46:05.911 --> 01:46:08.412]  Folks, somebody gave him a script to read!
[01:46:10.931 --> 01:46:13.733]  Somebody gave him a script to read.
[01:46:14.993 --> 01:46:20.336]  We broke it down yesterday how, as he was reading it, he was shocked at what was going on.
[01:46:20.436 --> 01:46:21.737]  He realized it pretty quickly.
[01:46:21.777 --> 01:46:23.278]  He was like, wait, he fought the Russians?
[01:46:23.558 --> 01:46:25.719]  The Russians were the ones that defeated the Nazis.
[01:46:26.539 --> 01:46:27.680]  You saw it in his face.
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:30.121]  And now he has to fall on the petard here.
[01:46:30.461 --> 01:46:31.602]  He has to fall on the sword.
[01:46:34.083 --> 01:46:34.744]  And look!
[01:46:36.364 --> 01:46:36.805]  Look at this!
[01:46:37.145 --> 01:46:38.886]  I'm telling you, this is the most clown thing I've ever seen.
[01:46:40.271 --> 01:46:45.013]  UK journalist arrested for mal-information after exposing Trudeau applauding Nazi.
[01:46:45.493 --> 01:46:54.436]  So a UK journalist, Warren Thornton, said, look, here's Zelensky in Canadian Parliament honoring a Nazi.
[01:46:54.796 --> 01:46:57.817]  He got arrested because they said, that's misinformation, he's not a Nazi.
[01:46:58.257 --> 01:47:03.959]  And now the Speaker has resigned because he honored a Nazi, even though they arrested a journalist for calling him a Nazi.
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:05.220]  Which is the truth!
[01:47:09.249 --> 01:47:11.312]  Honestly, honestly, look.
[01:47:12.995 --> 01:47:15.439]  This is gonna fall on deaf ears, but I mean, we just have to say it.
[01:47:18.061 --> 01:47:19.602]  You liberals are destroying everything.
[01:47:20.422 --> 01:47:22.523]  Can you not see that you're completely out of your minds?
[01:47:22.983 --> 01:47:34.729]  You guys need to take a deep breath, and you need to put your hatred aside, and you need to put your deranged politics aside, you need to put your own derangement aside, because you've completely lost your minds.
[01:47:35.389 --> 01:47:39.511]  I mean, you have lost your minds!
[01:47:41.670 --> 01:47:56.141]  You honored a Nazi to promote your war in Ukraine, you arrested a journalist for calling him a Nazi, and then you had somebody resign because he honored a Nazi, even though he wasn't even the one that made it happen.
[01:47:56.661 --> 01:48:03.913]   And the entire Canadian Parliament, members of the Canadian military, And Zelensky himself!
[01:48:04.753 --> 01:48:05.834]  There's a video going around.
[01:48:06.194 --> 01:48:13.257]  Look, I'm not going to claim Zelensky did a Nazi salute, but there's a video going around that when Zelensky stood up, I mean, he did go like this.
[01:48:14.258 --> 01:48:15.358]  Zelensky did go like that.
[01:48:15.959 --> 01:48:18.780]  Now again, I'm not saying Zelensky did a Nazi salute.
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:20.701]  You can go look at the video if you want for yourself.
[01:48:21.081 --> 01:48:35.370]  But, Zelensky honoured the Nazi, the Canadian Parliament honoured the Nazi, the Canadian military brass honoured the Nazi, a journalist got arrested for calling him a Nazi, and now the Speaker of the Canadian Parliament has resigned for honouring a Nazi.
[01:48:35.850 --> 01:48:37.231]  Even though he just reads a script.
[01:48:39.593 --> 01:48:40.073]  Seriously.
[01:48:41.774 --> 01:48:47.358]  Like, the whole world is dependent, like, you leftists, you guys need to seriously, like, take a break.
[01:48:48.448 --> 01:48:53.032]  And just take a breath and really... Yeah, there's the video right there.
[01:48:53.712 --> 01:48:54.433]  Crew pulls it up.
[01:48:54.613 --> 01:48:55.474]  Best crew in the business.
[01:48:56.174 --> 01:48:57.576]  So, I don't know what you call that.
[01:48:58.556 --> 01:48:59.337]  I really don't care.
[01:48:59.517 --> 01:49:01.799]  I'm not here to freak out about Zelensky, whatever that is.
[01:49:02.079 --> 01:49:09.745]  But, you know, it's him starting a war or potentially being the pivotal individual involved in starting a World War III or a nuclear holocaust.
[01:49:09.785 --> 01:49:10.526]  That's my problem.
[01:49:10.566 --> 01:49:13.729]  Not whether he actually did a Nazi salute to a no-Nazi.
[01:49:14.549 --> 01:49:16.010]  This whole thing is out of control.
[01:49:16.050 --> 01:49:17.412]  Like, just... I get it.
[01:49:18.294 --> 01:49:27.078]  You hate me, you hate Trump, you hate Alex Jones, you hate Roger Stone, you hate Republicans, you hate Vivek Ramaswamy, you hate, hate, hate, hate, you probably just hate yourselves.
[01:49:27.538 --> 01:49:28.778]  You need to step off.
[01:49:29.238 --> 01:49:31.659]  You're going to get the whole world into a nuclear holocaust.
[01:49:31.699 --> 01:49:32.380]  Is that funny?
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:33.880]  Is that worth all of your hate?
[01:49:34.761 --> 01:49:37.202]  You're honoring literal Nazis to support this war.
[01:49:37.402 --> 01:49:39.683]  You've completely lost your minds.
[01:49:40.243 --> 01:49:41.303]  You've completely lost the plot.
[01:49:41.343 --> 01:49:42.104]  Alright, there's no point.
[01:49:42.344 --> 01:49:43.124]  They're never going to wake up.
[01:49:43.144 --> 01:49:43.904]  They're just out of their minds.
[01:49:43.764 --> 01:49:50.264]  They're completely deranged.
[01:49:50.264 --> 01:49:52.764]  That's just, it's stunning.
[01:49:52.705 --> 01:49:58.047]  A journalist gets arrested for accurately reporting that the Canadian Parliament honoured a Nazi.
[01:49:58.327 --> 01:50:03.989]  He gets arrested, and then the next day the Speaker of Canadian Parliament resigns for honouring a Nazi.
[01:50:06.770 --> 01:50:09.111]  You people have lost your freaking minds!
[01:50:10.512 --> 01:50:11.632]  Oh, and you're gonna burn the world!
[01:50:16.499 --> 01:50:16.980]  Let's go to this.
[01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:21.610]  Let's go to a man who got interviewed outside a Trump rally yesterday in South Carolina.
[01:50:22.171 --> 01:50:25.919]  Former Democrat had this to say when asked about the media in clip five.
[01:50:28.035 --> 01:50:32.036]  President Trump is a true patriotic American.
[01:50:32.436 --> 01:50:37.017]  He's my Commander-in-Chief, will be soon again, and I love him.
[01:50:38.417 --> 01:50:45.998]  And being a black, Republican, black American conservative, that is very important to me.
[01:50:46.038 --> 01:50:47.058]  I used to be a Democrat.
[01:50:47.078 --> 01:50:52.579]  I had to walk away from the Democratic Party because, once again, what are they doing for, first and foremost, the country?
[01:50:53.279 --> 01:50:53.579]  Nothing.
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:56.620]  So it goes on, but you get the point.
[01:50:58.921 --> 01:51:01.282]  More evidence that liberals have completely lost their mind.
[01:51:02.302 --> 01:51:10.606]  If you go to any major Democrat city, I mean in San Francisco they have an app so that you can know where human feces is on the streets.
[01:51:10.646 --> 01:51:15.788]  The problem is the entire map is human feces, so it almost, it doesn't even serve the proper purpose.
[01:51:16.768 --> 01:51:19.349]  It like warns you, hey, here's where people go and poop on the streets.
[01:51:19.389 --> 01:51:20.209]  You might want to avoid it.
[01:51:20.289 --> 01:51:24.291]  And then it's every city block, every city corner, every city street.
[01:51:25.431 --> 01:51:29.421]   Well, it's not just Liberal San Francisco.
[01:51:29.521 --> 01:51:32.647]  It's also in Denver, Colorado.
[01:51:33.348 --> 01:51:35.392]  And so... I mean...
[01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:45.123]  I don't know if this would be a tactic that I would use, but you want to talk about picking up somebody else's excrement and putting it on their own doorstep?
[01:51:45.884 --> 01:51:46.284]  Literally.
[01:51:46.724 --> 01:51:56.468]  Denver radio host John Caldera scoops up human feces left by homeless people around Denver and puts it on the steps of the Capitol in Denver.
[01:51:57.549 --> 01:51:59.930]  And so here's how that went in clip seven.
[01:52:00.848 --> 01:52:04.551]  Here is, oh my god, human feces that I've cleaned up.
[01:52:04.771 --> 01:52:12.978]  John Caldera isn't the first person to pooh-pooh the work of city leaders, but he may well be the first to... We're living in a world of feces with liberals.
[01:52:12.998 --> 01:52:14.420]  Literally, a world of shit.
[01:52:16.929 --> 01:52:19.371]  To the people who have kept this homeless problem going.
[01:52:19.731 --> 01:52:29.740]  President of the Independence Institute, a think tank in downtown Denver, Caldera says he's tired of the homeless using his private property as their public restroom.
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:37.046]  He says at least twice a week, security cameras catch a homeless person defecating outside his business, or worse.
[01:52:37.426 --> 01:52:45.590]  We have to clean up vomit and urine and syringes and used condom and feces.
[01:52:46.170 --> 01:52:51.273]  Caldera says he's tried appealing to police and Mayor Mike Johnston to no avail.
[01:52:51.473 --> 01:52:54.294]  The answer, he says, isn't tiny homes.
[01:52:54.614 --> 01:52:55.635]  It's jail cells.
[01:52:56.115 --> 01:52:58.257]  This is not an affordable housing crisis.
[01:52:58.617 --> 01:52:59.999]  This is a drug crisis.
[01:53:00.179 --> 01:53:02.621]  This is a mental health crisis.
[01:53:03.042 --> 01:53:04.483]  And this is a crisis of law.
[01:53:04.963 --> 01:53:11.890]  That these people who need help will never get help if they are not brought to jail where they are forced to get some help.
[01:53:12.370 --> 01:53:18.593]  Meantime, he says he'll continue to fortify City Hall and urged other Denverites to do the same.
[01:53:18.813 --> 01:53:19.253]  Works for everybody.
[01:53:19.273 --> 01:53:21.774]  Next time you clean it up, drop it off here.
[01:53:22.095 --> 01:53:27.777]  Drop it off at City Hall as an act of civil disobedience to ask them to demand of them.
[01:53:27.797 --> 01:53:28.878]  Put Matt back on the screen.
[01:53:28.898 --> 01:53:30.399]  I mean, look.
[01:53:30.559 --> 01:53:33.260]  This is so ridiculous, I can't help but laugh.
[01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:34.140]  But I mean, there it is.
[01:53:34.601 --> 01:53:37.262]  This is your image of Democrat Party politics.
[01:53:38.228 --> 01:53:39.129]  You want Democrats?
[01:53:39.169 --> 01:53:39.829]  You want liberals?
[01:53:39.849 --> 01:53:41.030]  You want leftists running things?
[01:53:41.651 --> 01:53:45.133]  You will literally live in a world of shit.
[01:53:46.334 --> 01:53:47.355]  That's what they do.
[01:53:47.755 --> 01:53:48.255]  Literally.
[01:53:48.916 --> 01:53:54.500]  So they roll out the short stairs for Joe Biden because he can't walk up the big stairs.
[01:53:55.341 --> 01:54:02.766]  So they have the emergency stairs, the short stairs, and Joe Biden nearly fell down on the short stairs today.
[01:54:05.228 --> 01:54:06.329]  He's doing great, though.
[01:54:07.145 --> 01:54:07.926]  Everything is fine.
[01:54:07.966 --> 01:54:09.107]  The country's falling apart.
[01:54:09.787 --> 01:54:10.868]  Political imprisonment.
[01:54:11.809 --> 01:54:12.629]  Speech crimes.
[01:54:12.669 --> 01:54:13.450]  Thought crimes.
[01:54:13.570 --> 01:54:14.351]  Censorship.
[01:54:14.511 --> 01:54:15.992]  Anti-Second Amendment activity.
[01:54:16.092 --> 01:54:17.053]  War with Russia.
[01:54:17.133 --> 01:54:18.834]  Nuclear holocaust, potentially.
[01:54:18.934 --> 01:54:20.075]  Everything's great under Joe Biden.
[01:54:20.496 --> 01:54:21.536]  Economic distress.
[01:54:21.677 --> 01:54:22.437]  Catastrophe.
[01:54:22.497 --> 01:54:23.338]  Wide open border.
[01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:28.782]  And why do liberals lie about all of this and pretend it's not going on?
[01:54:30.263 --> 01:54:31.544]  Only because they hate you.
[01:54:31.845 --> 01:54:32.245]  That's it.
[01:54:33.346 --> 01:54:34.186]  That's all it is.
[01:54:34.246 --> 01:54:36.028]  It's because they hate you.
[01:54:40.455 --> 01:54:40.935]  What a shame.
[01:54:41.536 --> 01:54:45.998]  Border Patrol agent bloodied and attacked by illegal immigrant with rat tattooed on his head.
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:49.580]  Yeah.
[01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:55.003]  But see if they, uh, there's a woman who hugged police officers on January 6th.
[01:54:55.023 --> 01:54:55.643]  I'm not even kidding you.
[01:54:56.044 --> 01:55:03.067]  A woman who hugged police officers who's getting charged with crimes and the left say she's a violent criminal for hugging police officers on January 6th.
[01:55:03.408 --> 01:55:07.210]  But the illegal immigrant that attacked a Border Patrol agent, he's probably a hero to the left.
[01:55:08.551 --> 01:55:09.251]  That's their logic.
[01:55:11.693 --> 01:55:18.657]  In Chicago, a viral video, surveillance video of broad daylight robbery and beatdown in Bucktown neighborhood sparks community outrage.
[01:55:19.697 --> 01:55:28.022]  Yeah, well, they know they can commit a crime and the Soros District Attorney and the Democrat judges and everything else will put them back on the streets.
[01:55:29.562 --> 01:55:32.484]  Because they don't want to be racist and incarcerate violent criminals, see?
[01:55:33.982 --> 01:55:41.404]  So they just beat people down and rob them and steal their cars, sometimes kill them, and they know, hey, I'll be right back on the streets, no big deal, couple nights in jail, it's all good.
[01:55:43.124 --> 01:55:43.924]  Thanks, Democrats.
[01:55:46.485 --> 01:55:46.985]  Thank you.
[01:55:50.205 --> 01:55:57.627]  Now the Democrats are threatening a government shutdown if they don't get their spending bills, and some of the Republicans are along for the ride, but don't worry!
[01:56:00.336 --> 01:56:03.878]  Because Ukraine will still get their money and they're gonna make sure of it.
[01:56:05.559 --> 01:56:05.859]  U.S.
[01:56:05.899 --> 01:56:09.662]  to keep paying salaries for tens of thousands of Ukrainians during government shutdown.
[01:56:09.722 --> 01:56:14.244]  And they'll fund their farms and infrastructure and their oligarchs.
[01:56:14.324 --> 01:56:15.085]  But if the U.S.
[01:56:15.105 --> 01:56:18.267]  government shuts down, you won't be getting paid if you're a member of Congress.
[01:56:18.507 --> 01:56:21.889]  And by the way, this is just their threat to get people to vote for it.
[01:56:22.109 --> 01:56:28.673]  As Congress limps towards government shutdown, some members champion punitive legislation to prevent future impasses.
[01:56:29.861 --> 01:56:32.663]  What is that punitive legislation?
[01:56:34.525 --> 01:56:37.867]  The No Pay for Congress During Default or Shutdown Act.
[01:56:38.648 --> 01:56:43.892]  Which would block the pay of members of Congress if the public debt limit is reached or a federal government shutdown occurs.
[01:56:43.912 --> 01:56:47.795]  So in other words, don't shut the government down or you won't get paid!
[01:56:49.316 --> 01:56:52.098]  And it's the Biden economy and everybody's broke so they need that money.
[01:56:52.939 --> 01:56:58.804]  Unless of course, you know, you're like AOC or Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer who's filthy rich.
[01:57:00.862 --> 01:57:01.623]  Then you'll be fine.
[01:57:02.604 --> 01:57:03.605]  But oh, see that?
[01:57:03.885 --> 01:57:06.067]  Oh, you better fund the government or no money for you!
[01:57:09.530 --> 01:57:11.332]  Oh, and you think that's going to sway some people?
[01:57:11.412 --> 01:57:12.093]  Of course it will.
[01:57:13.735 --> 01:57:14.535]  Of course it will.
[01:57:15.276 --> 01:57:19.500]  But don't worry, the money will continue to go to Ukraine no matter what.
[01:57:21.262 --> 01:57:21.923]  No matter what.
[01:57:23.024 --> 01:57:35.967]  And you've got radicals like Democrat Representative Jamal Bowman who's calling out Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema because they're not for unlimited funding of the government and unlimited funding for the war in Ukraine.
[01:57:35.987 --> 01:57:39.688]  He goes on this huge diatribe on his Twitter account and curses them out.
[01:57:39.908 --> 01:57:40.908]  Literally curses them out.
[01:57:42.808 --> 01:57:48.029]  Because they don't want unlimited funding of war and unlimited funding of a corrupt government like Democrats do.
[01:57:48.909 --> 01:57:51.090]  Jamal Bowman really wants that paycheck, doesn't he?
[01:57:51.795 --> 01:57:54.137]  He really wants that taxpayer-funded paycheck.
[01:57:56.619 --> 01:58:01.964]  So he tells them to do your effing jobs, he calls them cowards, he says they've betrayed people.
[01:58:03.265 --> 01:58:06.008]  Oh yeah, but how are those Democrat-run cities doing, Jamal?
[01:58:06.168 --> 01:58:07.129]  How's Baltimore doing?
[01:58:07.169 --> 01:58:07.509]  How's St.
[01:58:07.549 --> 01:58:07.950]  Louis doing?
[01:58:07.970 --> 01:58:08.790]  How's Chicago doing?
[01:58:08.830 --> 01:58:09.811]  How's San Francisco doing?
[01:58:09.831 --> 01:58:10.492]  They doing alright?
[01:58:11.433 --> 01:58:12.293]  No, not so much.
[01:58:13.695 --> 01:58:14.876]  Not so much, actually.
[01:58:16.866 --> 01:58:22.851]  As Americans struggle with the cost of food and other basics, Joe Biden vows to take on the high price of concert tickets.
[01:58:25.192 --> 01:58:34.839]  Now, I will say, I've been a frequent concert goer in my life, and concert tickets are about double what they were four years ago, say.
[01:58:34.859 --> 01:58:37.261]  I mean, really, it actually is astronomical.
[01:58:37.682 --> 01:58:41.664]  Prices for a concert ticket are astronomical under Joe Biden.
[01:58:41.925 --> 01:58:45.868]  But like the article here says, so is everything else.
[01:58:47.574 --> 01:58:50.456]  Your grocery bill is increased probably about 30%.
[01:58:52.637 --> 01:58:54.658]  Your energy bill is up about 30 to 40%.
[01:58:56.099 --> 01:58:57.579]  The price of gas is up over 50%.
[01:58:57.820 --> 01:59:00.501]  It's almost double actually.
[01:59:00.541 --> 01:59:02.502]  It's about up 100% under Joe Biden.
[01:59:04.103 --> 01:59:07.365]  Which then everything else increases in cost as well.
[01:59:09.801 --> 01:59:15.623]  And so this is the economic misery of Bidenomics, but don't worry, he's going to get those concert tickets lowered.
[01:59:16.284 --> 01:59:18.545]  And this is all about trying to reach the youth vote.
[01:59:20.305 --> 01:59:28.088]  And look, I really don't even want to go back down this stupid Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce saga.
[01:59:29.149 --> 01:59:36.532]  You know, if Travis Kelce wants to promote vaccines and for more money, you know, how much money is enough, Travis?
[01:59:37.645 --> 01:59:42.947]  Congratulations, you're a two-time Super Bowl champion alpha male, and now you're dating Taylor Swift, who's mid at best.
[01:59:43.787 --> 01:59:46.588]  But she's filthy rich too, so okay, you're now an it couple.
[01:59:47.009 --> 01:59:48.429]  That's great, but you know what?
[01:59:50.150 --> 01:59:50.650]  You know what?
[01:59:52.070 --> 01:59:58.793]  There's now something you're never gonna be able to say for the rest of your life, that you never promoted a product that killed somebody.
[02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:03.381]  So, I don't know how much money you got paid for all this.
[02:00:03.561 --> 02:00:05.882]  I feel like the whole thing is a psy-op, quite frankly.
[02:00:06.503 --> 02:00:15.887]  If this is Travis Kelce chasing tail, uh, just so he can put Taylor Swift on his list, then, uh, I mean, okay, that's quite a commitment.
[02:00:16.747 --> 02:00:21.429]  She's not even that good-looking, but, uh, I guess she is that famous and rich, so, perhaps.
[02:00:23.930 --> 02:00:25.791]  I guess it's like the old Dave Chappelle Oprah joke.
[02:00:27.792 --> 02:00:31.793]   But, uh, Why am I bringing this up?
[02:00:32.573 --> 02:00:40.237]  Because Taylor Swift is using her platform to get young voters to register to vote Democrat.
[02:00:41.818 --> 02:00:45.720]  And she's been at the center of this high ticket price issue.
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:48.561]  And so that's why Joe Biden is doing this.
[02:00:48.981 --> 02:00:50.822]  This is all about reaching the youth vote.
[02:00:52.063 --> 02:00:53.703]  And they're using Taylor Swift to do it.
[02:00:53.784 --> 02:00:57.145]  They're using the, we're combating high ticket prices to do it.
[02:00:57.746 --> 02:01:01.876]   And then, I mean, The whole Travis Kelsey angle is just odd.
[02:01:02.136 --> 02:01:05.058]  And look, most Kansas City Chiefs fans are Republicans and conservatives.
[02:01:05.659 --> 02:01:07.961]  And whatever, you want to promote Bud Light, fine.
[02:01:08.261 --> 02:01:09.903]  You want to date Taylor Swift, who cares?
[02:01:10.864 --> 02:01:15.027]  But promoting the vaccine, that's like... That's nauseating.
[02:01:15.167 --> 02:01:16.549]  That's next-level pathetic.
[02:01:19.031 --> 02:01:23.315]  And so, yeah, Taylor Swift is using the new popularity to register voters Democrat.
[02:01:24.508 --> 02:01:30.571]  And Travis Kelce with his double vaccinated arm for his new Pfizer commercial is going to help part of the process.
[02:01:31.212 --> 02:01:32.012]  I hope it's worth it.
[02:01:32.192 --> 02:01:33.433]  I hope it's worth it, Travis.
[02:01:34.594 --> 02:01:36.755]  By the way, Travis is on an interview.
[02:01:36.775 --> 02:01:38.616]  It was probably about four years ago, and people can change.
[02:01:38.636 --> 02:01:47.841]  But he said he's not going to date you if you won't go down on him or, you know, let him inside after three dates.
[02:01:47.961 --> 02:01:49.462]  So, I mean, we can only make assumptions.
[02:01:50.302 --> 02:01:55.610]   But honestly, I don't even care about all that.
[02:01:56.070 --> 02:01:57.310]  It's disgusting.
[02:01:57.591 --> 02:02:10.397]  It's disgusting to promote a vaccine that has killed so many people, and it's disgusting to promote a pharmaceutical product, the flu shot, that is 100% ineffective.
[02:02:10.857 --> 02:02:12.438]  It's just disgusting.
[02:02:13.238 --> 02:02:15.960]  So whatever, you want to chase Taylor Swift around, I don't care.
[02:02:17.308 --> 02:02:18.630]  I'm a heterosexual man.
[02:02:18.810 --> 02:02:19.210]  I get it.
[02:02:20.112 --> 02:02:21.473]  You want to promote Bud Light?
[02:02:21.573 --> 02:02:21.914]  Fine.
[02:02:21.954 --> 02:02:23.335]  I'm sure you made millions of dollars.
[02:02:23.476 --> 02:02:24.056]  That's great.
[02:02:25.698 --> 02:02:31.785]  But you can no longer say that you've never promoted a product that has led to people dying.
[02:02:33.968 --> 02:02:34.649]  And I mean, here you go.
[02:02:36.957 --> 02:02:41.459]  Vaccinated soccer star Matty Cusack, 27 years old, dies suddenly.
[02:02:41.479 --> 02:02:47.241]  27-year-old footballer Matty Cusack dies, and suddenly the media have no curiosity to find out why.
[02:02:47.301 --> 02:02:48.041]  Cause of death unknown.
[02:02:48.302 --> 02:02:50.562]  By the way, it's just like, have you seen the VAERS numbers?
[02:02:51.423 --> 02:02:56.845]  Since 2021, vaccine deaths went from a couple hundred a year to almost 10,000 a year.
[02:02:57.405 --> 02:02:59.106]  Same thing with miscarriages!
[02:02:59.406 --> 02:03:04.288]  Go look at the numbers on miscarriages post-vaccination.
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:06.661]  Geez.
[02:03:06.981 --> 02:03:08.023]  Oh, but maybe that was the deal.
[02:03:08.063 --> 02:03:12.008]  Hey, Travis, if you want to date Taylor Swift, you got to promote the vaccine.
[02:03:12.028 --> 02:03:14.973]  You got to take, you got to take one inside you to get one inside.
[02:03:14.993 --> 02:03:21.081]  Well, racist Joe Biden has done it again and accidentally let the cat out of the bag.
[02:03:22.708 --> 02:03:26.713]  Biden goes off script, says black people will suffer if U.S.
[02:03:26.733 --> 02:03:27.974]  government shutdown occurs.
[02:03:28.675 --> 02:03:29.516]  And there it is.
[02:03:29.816 --> 02:03:35.062]  See, the Democrats don't want black Americans to be successful and independent.
[02:03:35.202 --> 02:03:41.810]  The Democrats want black Americans to be dependent on the government so that they can do things like this and say things like that.
[02:03:44.053 --> 02:03:45.074]  You better vote for us.
[02:03:45.614 --> 02:03:49.298]  You better vote for us, black Americans, or you're gonna go broke.
[02:03:49.918 --> 02:03:53.301]  What a sick, disgusting thing to think or say.
[02:03:53.862 --> 02:03:57.465]  But that's Democrat Party policy, and they still get the black vote somehow.
[02:03:57.745 --> 02:04:00.468]  But maybe not so much anymore.
[02:04:01.649 --> 02:04:02.550]  Maybe not so much anymore.
[02:04:04.793 --> 02:04:12.582]  And, um, boy oh boy, you know, I almost don't even want to give any more attention to this story, but it's so incredible, actually.
[02:04:13.062 --> 02:04:25.596]  This Democrat paid for teenager, they got a couple of them operating on the internet, but this Harry Sisson guy, and look, I wonder who put him up to this, but look, he's a young guy and the Democrats are probably paying him six figures.
[02:04:26.511 --> 02:04:36.941]  And so, I mean, I guess, I guess, you know, sacrificing your entire integrity and honesty is worth six figures when you're a teenager, supposedly, for this individual.
[02:04:36.961 --> 02:04:54.627]   But it appears, beyond a reasonable doubt at this point, and people have gone into it and done complete breakdowns, that it appears this guy either faked a bomb threat against himself or I don't even know what else it would possibly be.
[02:04:55.048 --> 02:05:13.540]  Or somebody else did it to him, and then he made a big thing on social media, and people dug into it, and they basically found no proof of a police report, they found no proof of a bomb threat, they called local authorities, they called New York University, and the whole thing has just become a disaster for this young man, who's sold his integrity and his honesty out for Democrat Party money.
[02:05:17.563 --> 02:05:19.324]  But this is what the left does.
[02:05:20.552 --> 02:05:25.513]  Anonymous political commentator Cat Turd swatted after being doxxed by leftists.
[02:05:25.673 --> 02:05:26.713]  They're the ones that doxxed.
[02:05:26.833 --> 02:05:27.914]  They're the ones that swat.
[02:05:28.154 --> 02:05:30.574]  They're the ones that call in bomb threats to political events.
[02:05:30.814 --> 02:05:31.734]  Not conservatives.
[02:05:32.875 --> 02:05:34.215]  They're the Jussie Smolletts.
[02:05:36.075 --> 02:06:01.542]   But, so the incredible thing about this Harry Smollett, Harry Smollett-Sisson, Is that even though he's been called out by multiple investigative reporters, and even though multiple people have called the local law enforcement and the university security, and they've said, nope, there's been no such bomb threat, we have no reports, multiple investigative reporters, he keeps doubling down.
[02:06:01.802 --> 02:06:06.504]  But what's strange is, obviously that's his job as a Democrat Party propagandist.
[02:06:06.684 --> 02:06:10.745]  So, okay, fine, that's the decision he's made to sell his integrity out for Democrat Party money.
[02:06:11.426 --> 02:06:22.075]   What's incredible though, ladies and gentlemen, There are thousands of replies to this individual's propaganda on Twitter.
[02:06:22.295 --> 02:06:23.256]  Thousands of replies.
[02:06:24.116 --> 02:06:29.319]  And when I say there is zero percent belief, I mean zero.
[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:35.122]  You cannot find a single person that believes this kid.
[02:06:35.843 --> 02:06:36.943]  Nobody believes him!
[02:06:37.504 --> 02:06:38.264]  Literally zero!
[02:06:40.956 --> 02:06:50.719]  I went through the replies to all his different videos and all of his different BS, and I did not find one individual that believed him.
[02:06:51.299 --> 02:06:56.540]  And the few lefties or liberals or democrats that get in there, they say, Harry, you're embarrassing all of us, please stop this.
[02:06:58.100 --> 02:06:59.601]  Not one person!
[02:06:59.701 --> 02:07:01.161]  So, see, this is the problem.
[02:07:02.542 --> 02:07:04.262]  It's the same thing with the Russell Brand thing.
[02:07:07.799 --> 02:07:14.307]  Let's just say, and I don't, just to be clear, I don't believe it for a second, I'm not even trying to humor the kid, but let's just make a larger point here.
[02:07:15.428 --> 02:07:17.330]  Let's just say that there was a bomb threat to him.
[02:07:18.191 --> 02:07:20.214]  Nobody is ever going to believe liberals anymore.
[02:07:20.354 --> 02:07:21.916]  They are now the boy that cried wolf.
[02:07:22.932 --> 02:07:25.735]  They make up rape accusations as a political weapon.
[02:07:26.375 --> 02:07:30.919]  They make up threats against themselves like Jussie Smollett as a political weapon.
[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:33.522]  So you understand what you've done to yourself now?
[02:07:34.443 --> 02:07:37.766]  You might actually be a victim and no one's ever going to believe you now.
[02:07:38.907 --> 02:07:46.674]  There might be a woman that was actually raped by somebody against your politics and nobody will ever believe her now because of you.
[02:07:50.035 --> 02:07:51.776]  Maybe you never heard about the boy that cried wolf.
[02:07:51.816 --> 02:07:52.996]  You might want to research it.
[02:07:53.016 --> 02:08:02.059]  Because now the liberals are the boy that cried wolf and nobody will ever believe anything they say ever again.
[02:08:03.319 --> 02:08:04.320]  And who, how could you?
[02:08:08.141 --> 02:08:09.441]  Why would anybody trust a liberal?
[02:08:11.502 --> 02:08:14.003]  Now this is a fantastical story out of Austin.
[02:08:15.726 --> 02:08:21.891]  And I've seen this stuff myself, never like this, but there's some driverless cars that go around Austin here.
[02:08:23.513 --> 02:08:29.137]  Driverless disarray, autonomous vehicles cause massive traffic jam after Texas Longhorns football game.
[02:08:31.139 --> 02:08:39.105]  And there's a larger story here, aside from perhaps this failed technology, or maybe it was hacked, or who knows what happened.
[02:08:39.506 --> 02:08:43.429]  Here's the larger story, because this is what the automated world has to offer.
[02:08:44.571 --> 02:08:51.906]  This is what the administrative state, bureaucratic state, automated world, corporate world government has to offer, folks.
[02:08:53.604 --> 02:09:06.450]  It will eventually break down, and there will be no human touch, there will be no human element, it will just be you versus a faceless, soulless machine of a system built to oppress you, and there will be no recourse.
[02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:26.365]   It won't just be traffic jams caused by autonomous vehicles, it'll be complete bureaucratic failure, power grids going down, who knows what kind of mistakes, maybe you get arrested by a robot unjustly, maybe somebody gets shot and killed by a robot unjustly, Whatever it is, and there is no human touch, it's total death to civilization.
[02:09:26.906 --> 02:09:28.468]  Complete death to civilization.
[02:09:30.472 --> 02:09:30.792]  And then...
[02:09:32.051 --> 02:09:58.448]  It's a lot like that Dark Mirror episode, I forget the name of it, but it's the social credit score episode, where, oh, you actually said the wrong thing, or you actually did the wrong thing, and now you lose your social credit score, and now you can't eat, and now you can't travel, and now you can't fill your car with gas, and now you can't open the door to your house, and now you literally are stuck on the streets with no recourse whatsoever, and nobody's gonna help you, because they don't want their social credit score to go down.
[02:10:00.066 --> 02:10:01.247]  That's the automated world.
[02:10:01.607 --> 02:10:10.134]  That's the corporate world government, global enslavement under the automated bureaucratic system, corporate world government that they want us to live in.
[02:10:11.455 --> 02:10:28.849]  And that video of the autonomous cars causing the traffic jam and getting stuck and all confused on the road, that is just symbolic in a very minor, less consequential way of what the world will be in this fully automated corporate world government with no human touch.
[02:10:32.335 --> 02:10:38.879]  Biden regime spends $800,000 on harm reduction program that distributes crack pipes in Texas.
[02:10:39.119 --> 02:10:46.544]  Now, I might be a little at the risk of sounding foolish here.
[02:10:46.584 --> 02:11:00.493]  I couldn't help but think this the other night because we spend all this money on crack pipes, we spend all this money on making sure drug addicts on the streets can get drugs and needles and everything, and we also spend a lot of money on gay.
[02:11:01.718 --> 02:11:02.419]  Gay research.
[02:11:02.859 --> 02:11:05.222]  You know, we spend money on gay research in the military.
[02:11:05.262 --> 02:11:09.867]  We spend money on LGBTQ, two-spirit, genderqueer stuff culturally.
[02:11:09.927 --> 02:11:13.652]  I mean, millions, if not hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars goes into this stuff.
[02:11:14.713 --> 02:11:21.079]   And the other night in Austin, I guess it was a Sunday night, We had a major storm.
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:31.768]  And every once in a while, one of these storms comes through, these electric storms come through, and I mean, you look up at the sky for an hour, and the lightning never stops.
[02:11:31.829 --> 02:11:34.171]  I mean, it's an incredible spectacle.
[02:11:34.191 --> 02:11:41.577]  I was enamored by it for like 20 minutes, just sitting out in my driveway, watching this incredible electrical storm.
[02:11:41.617 --> 02:11:42.778]  I'm sure some of the crew saw it too.
[02:11:42.818 --> 02:12:04.232]   And I'm just sitting here, and I'm just thinking, You know, if we, instead of spending all this money on gay, LGBTQ+, and crack pipes and needles and stuff, and we tried to find a way to actually effectively harness this incredible electricity and this storm here, I mean, it's just like, what are we doing?
[02:12:06.073 --> 02:12:24.550]   Why are we more concerned about finding out about sexual crap and drug addict crap Instead of inspiring geniuses with innovative minds to figure out how we can harness this incredible electrical storm that's going on for two hours non-stop in the sky.
[02:12:24.590 --> 02:12:28.033]  I mean, lightning bolts streaking across the entire sky.
[02:12:28.533 --> 02:12:29.554]  Like a hundred miles long.
[02:12:29.834 --> 02:12:30.415]  All night long.
[02:12:30.615 --> 02:12:36.019]  It's... I mean, I'm just... I'm just like, is there... We can't... We don't know how to harness this consistently?
[02:12:36.059 --> 02:12:37.260]  We can't create technology?
[02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:38.341]  And I mean... No!
[02:12:38.401 --> 02:12:40.003]  Because we gotta research gay!
[02:12:41.906 --> 02:12:45.890]  We gotta research gay, and we gotta fund drug addicts and crack addicts.
[02:12:46.891 --> 02:12:50.634]  Oh, and by the way, and more to the last story.
[02:12:51.015 --> 02:12:52.356]  Was that from this weekend?
[02:12:52.696 --> 02:12:54.798]  I mean, did you guys see that storm the other night?
[02:12:54.838 --> 02:12:55.519]  I mean, seriously.
[02:12:55.839 --> 02:12:58.221]  Like, that was unreal stuff.
[02:13:00.644 --> 02:13:02.746]  But back to the other issue of the automated world.
[02:13:03.971 --> 02:13:08.855]  New York is now putting police robots out on the subway because the police have been defunded.
[02:13:09.376 --> 02:13:11.758]  And AOC kind of gets it, but not fully.
[02:13:11.778 --> 02:13:15.761]  She says, New York schools got defunded to pay for these privacy disasters on wheels.
[02:13:15.861 --> 02:13:17.122]  No, the police got defunded.
[02:13:17.582 --> 02:13:19.124]  The schools were already a disaster.
[02:13:19.244 --> 02:13:20.325]  This is your doing.
[02:13:20.525 --> 02:13:22.226]  Democrats run New York City.
[02:13:22.346 --> 02:13:27.250]  You are now the ones that made police robots that are going to be worse than actual police.
[02:13:28.251 --> 02:13:29.652]  The whole automated system will be worse.
[02:13:29.772 --> 02:13:30.053]  Alright.
[02:13:30.333 --> 02:13:34.413]   Maria Z takes over the Alex Jones show on the other side of this break
[02:13:34.413 --> 02:13:56.613]   In a galaxy of endless energy needs the power of turboforce rises above the rest

[02:14:19.733 --> 02:14:20.794]  I've been shadowbanned.
[02:14:21.594 --> 02:14:22.855]  I've been called a liar.
[02:14:23.596 --> 02:14:27.038]  I've been silenced on virtually every platform created by man.
[02:14:27.719 --> 02:14:30.041]  My life has been threatened, repeatedly.
[02:14:30.641 --> 02:14:33.203]  They've tried to destroy me, but I've survived.
[02:14:34.364 --> 02:14:36.825]  And that's why I'm joining Mug Club.
[02:14:38.327 --> 02:14:40.848]  The replatforming begins now!

[02:14:51.851 --> 02:14:56.712]  I'm your guest host, Maria Z, reporting to you from the land down under.
[02:14:56.752 --> 02:14:57.172]  That's right.
[02:14:57.332 --> 02:14:59.072]  I'm back in Australia.
[02:14:59.673 --> 02:15:01.933]  And let me tell you all, I miss Texas.
[02:15:02.373 --> 02:15:05.574]  Texas is such an amazing place with such amazing people.
[02:15:05.614 --> 02:15:06.914]  The whole United States is.
[02:15:07.314 --> 02:15:12.056]  But today I want to talk to you about what's happening in the United States.
[02:15:12.076 --> 02:15:24.019]   I want to talk to you about What's happening at the border and who better to talk about all of that than Michael Yon who's doing some of the most important work in the country right now as we speak at the border.
[02:15:24.459 --> 02:15:31.141]  But before we talk about that, I want to discuss some really breaking news that's come out of Australia.
[02:15:31.181 --> 02:15:34.122]  You all may know dictator Dan Andrews.
[02:15:34.582 --> 02:15:56.313]   From the state of Victoria, he's the Premier that's known for introducing his pandemic powers, which basically allowed him to declare a pandemic, even if one was not present in Australia or anywhere in the world, and bring in these Well, it's the same as when Jacinta Ardern, Jab Sinta as we call her, she resigned as well.
[02:15:56.333 --> 02:16:00.636]  All of these leaders just resign and they seem to be replaced with other tyrants or other incapable people.
[02:16:00.456 --> 02:16:07.096]   now resigned. Now why is that important? Well, it's the same as when Jacinta Ardern, Jab
[02:16:07.096 --> 02:16:13.655]   Cinta as we call her, she resigned as well. All of these leaders just resign and they
[02:16:13.655 --> 02:16:19.395]   seem to be replaced with other tyrants or other incapable people. And Michael Yon and
[02:16:19.395 --> 02:16:26.456]   I have spoken about the reason why they keep putting these dog kings in charge.
[02:16:26.796 --> 02:16:30.559]  So Michael joins us right now from the border.
[02:16:30.639 --> 02:16:32.761]  Michael, thank you so much for coming on today.
[02:16:34.820 --> 02:16:36.002]  Thanks for having me back on.
[02:16:36.062 --> 02:16:38.425]  It's been a while since we met up in the United States.
[02:16:38.445 --> 02:16:39.446]  You're already back home.
[02:16:40.187 --> 02:16:41.128]  There's so much to see.
[02:16:41.168 --> 02:16:43.130]  I was hoping to get you down here in Panama.
[02:16:43.471 --> 02:16:44.772]  I'm actually in Panama now.
[02:16:45.233 --> 02:16:54.504]  I've been down the Darién Gap, which many people know is a major migration route, or let's say invasion route, is more accurate to the United States from the rest of the world.
[02:16:55.004 --> 02:17:00.668]  So the Darien Gap is that area between Colombia and Panama, which I've been coming to for about three years now.
[02:17:02.029 --> 02:17:09.414]  I've probably spent six months here, actually, since Biden was installed, recognizing that this would be a major path to the United States.
[02:17:09.494 --> 02:17:09.994]  And it is now.
[02:17:10.154 --> 02:17:14.977]  Last month, about 82,000 passed through here, according to the Panamanian government.
[02:17:15.338 --> 02:17:17.519]  But this month, it's clearly going to be maybe 100,000.
[02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:24.584]  It's unclear, but the numbers are clearly up and they're increasing, which is even more significant because this is rainy season.
[02:17:25.224 --> 02:17:27.645]  And so right now I'm in a hotel room.
[02:17:27.685 --> 02:17:34.169]  I came up to Panama City to look at the Panama Canal and then to look at some other issues and then back down into the jungle.
[02:17:34.569 --> 02:17:39.071]  But the bottom line is this is just one of many invasion routes to the United States.
[02:17:39.451 --> 02:17:47.436]  We've reached a point where any presidential candidate in the United States who's not talking about mass deportations is just not a serious person.
[02:17:47.976 --> 02:17:51.418]  I mean closing the border, it's too late for that to be enough.
[02:17:51.538 --> 02:17:56.842]   I made this Hyperlapse and Dairy and Gap a couple weeks ago at a place called Las Blancas.
[02:17:57.262 --> 02:18:01.225]  That's a that's one of the camps that was built in part by United States money.
[02:18:01.646 --> 02:18:08.852]  Our flag is in that camp and they were coming down the Rio Turquesa and that is, you know, the Ferromax.
[02:18:09.472 --> 02:18:10.773]  I did not make that drone video.
[02:18:10.793 --> 02:18:14.717]  I don't know who did but that that the Ferromax trains.
[02:18:14.837 --> 02:18:17.339]  I think about 60 were stopped as of yesterday.
[02:18:17.839 --> 02:18:26.987]  Those trains, by the way, the Red Cross hands out maps down here in Panama to the people who are crossing into the United States, and they tell you which train lines you can get on.
[02:18:27.388 --> 02:18:39.478]  And they also, I was just looking at one of the maps I had this morning, and it says in English and Spanish, and I think French as well, it says, you know, don't get on the trains drunk.
[02:18:39.519 --> 02:18:42.741]  Don't, you know, when you're riding on the outside of the trains, you know, watch each other.
[02:18:43.562 --> 02:18:46.430]  Don't do drugs, don't do... because people keep falling off those trains.
[02:18:46.450 --> 02:18:47.674]  That's one of the reasons why the...
[02:18:49.438 --> 02:19:02.124]  So many trains are... Anyway, the government, the Mexican government is claiming that they've stopped those five dozen trains because migrants, aliens, illegal aliens keep getting killed falling off the trains.
[02:19:02.584 --> 02:19:05.386]  I mean, but you see how they climb on those trains.
[02:19:05.586 --> 02:19:07.387]  Michael, we're about to go to a break.
[02:19:08.287 --> 02:19:10.288]  I want to continue this on the other side of the break.
[02:19:10.308 --> 02:19:11.989]  You know what the biggest shame is?
[02:19:12.429 --> 02:19:18.908]   that we're only now starting to get the mainstream media in the United States covering just how
[02:19:18.908 --> 02:19:22.108]   serious this is when you've been screaming about it from the beginning.
[02:19:22.108 --> 02:19:27.268]   And so kudos to you for raising the alarm, but they really need to catch up and maybe
[02:19:27.268 --> 02:19:32.108]   start listening to the so-called conspiracy theorists before it becomes so dire.
[02:19:32.108 --> 02:19:33.108]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:19:33.108 --> 02:19:35.388]   Michael Yeung continues to cover this on the other side of the break.
[02:19:35.916 --> 02:19:42.399]  Shame, shame, shame to the legacy media for not talking about this sooner.
[02:19:42.439 --> 02:19:58.739]   But let me tell you, if you want to cover the truth and if you want to speak about why this is actually happening at the border and why everything that Michael Yon has been screaming from the rooftops For all this time is happening.
[02:19:59.059 --> 02:20:06.444]  Just look up UN replacement migration at the tip of every single one of these agendas at the tip of the pyramid.
[02:20:07.345 --> 02:20:08.667]  is the United Nations.
[02:20:08.727 --> 02:20:12.711]  They are one of the most evil organisations on this earth.
[02:20:13.612 --> 02:20:27.106]  And, you know, I've spent a lot of time exposing the UN, so much so that they recently responded, the head of their media responded to an article about me, where I was actually exposing a pedophilic document that they endorsed.
[02:20:27.827 --> 02:20:30.830]  And so, you know, I'm in their sights, but that's okay.
[02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:32.712]  I'm going to keep exposing these people.
[02:20:32.792 --> 02:20:40.400]  Michael Yan is here to talk about the US invasion in line with the UN replacement migration strategy.
[02:20:40.440 --> 02:20:41.381]  Please continue, Michael.
[02:20:43.064 --> 02:20:43.324]  Right.
[02:20:43.524 --> 02:20:44.444]  It is a replacement.
[02:20:44.484 --> 02:20:45.665]  This is an actual war.
[02:20:45.725 --> 02:20:52.507]  Of course, sometimes I leave Panama and fly straight to Europe, usually Netherlands, because that's another epicenter for the attacks.
[02:20:53.147 --> 02:21:02.230]  You can see this is weaponized migration, which I've been... Keep in mind, there are Americans who've been mourning about this for decades, and mostly they went unheeded.
[02:21:02.330 --> 02:21:13.354]   There have been people mourning about this, and now it's reached a point where, I mean, really at this point, the people that haven't noticed it yet, I don't know what's wrong with them.
[02:21:13.534 --> 02:21:15.015]  You know what I mean?
[02:21:15.115 --> 02:21:21.379]  I mean, there's something actually cognitively off or they're very young and they haven't developed the context yet.
[02:21:21.419 --> 02:21:27.143]  But if you're like in your 30s and 40s and you don't realize that this is a problem, you're probably going to die.
[02:21:27.403 --> 02:21:28.184]  I mean, seriously.
[02:21:28.264 --> 02:21:29.865]  And I mean that with full seriousness.
[02:21:30.665 --> 02:21:33.287]  There is a clear war unfolding in the United States and Europe.
[02:21:33.487 --> 02:21:34.727]  These will be massive wars.
[02:21:35.088 --> 02:21:36.548]  Keep in mind, war is what I do.
[02:21:36.949 --> 02:21:38.790]  I've spent years in wars around the world.
[02:21:39.170 --> 02:21:45.813]  Iraq, Afghanistan, running off the Philippines, Thailand, got kicked out of Hong Kong before the COVID lockdowns.
[02:21:45.873 --> 02:21:50.616]  You know, I'm constantly off in these conflicts and I'm very familiar with the dynamics.
[02:21:52.677 --> 02:22:00.223]  Before Russia invaded Ukraine, I was down in Morocco watching Morocco weaponize migrants against Spain and the EU.
[02:22:01.201 --> 02:22:06.966]  Morocco, by the way, is a longtime ally of the United States, and I have much respect for Morocco.
[02:22:06.986 --> 02:22:12.730]  They were the first country actually to recognize the independence of the United States long ago.
[02:22:13.111 --> 02:22:14.592]  Actually, all the Moroccans know that.
[02:22:14.632 --> 02:22:22.719]  If you meet a Moroccan and you say, if you're an American and you say, thank you for being first to recognize that, they all know that, but almost no Americans do.
[02:22:23.319 --> 02:22:30.485]  But the bottom line is, I was down in Morocco with Chuck Colton and we were watching, there's two Spanish cities that are enclaves in Morocco.
[02:22:30.845 --> 02:22:34.707]  So, there's those EU cities actually in Africa, right?
[02:22:34.868 --> 02:22:36.369]  Morocco's in Northern Africa.
[02:22:36.849 --> 02:22:46.176]   So, those EU cities that are in Africa, if you can make it into one of those cities, Ceuta or Melilla, The ones that are in Morocco, the Spanish cities in Morocco.
[02:22:46.616 --> 02:22:47.857]  You are now in the EU.
[02:22:48.357 --> 02:22:52.340]  So, Morocco will use those weaponized migrants.
[02:22:52.580 --> 02:22:55.222]  It doesn't mean they have weapons, but just the presence there.
[02:22:55.542 --> 02:22:57.903]  They're camped outside Ceuta, for instance.
[02:22:58.003 --> 02:22:58.744]  Chuck and I were out.
[02:22:59.064 --> 02:23:03.787]  They were living in the rocks, the migrants, the aliens, living literally like the Goths.
[02:23:03.867 --> 02:23:06.529]  I mean, they're beyond the pale, the Irish might say.
[02:23:06.549 --> 02:23:11.973]  They were literally, you know, just living outside the city walls of Ceuta.
[02:23:12.453 --> 02:23:19.476]  And occasionally when Morocco is unhappy with Spain or wants to get something out of them, they'll let those aliens rush the walls.
[02:23:19.516 --> 02:23:21.337]  You can see photos online of them doing this.
[02:23:21.697 --> 02:23:31.981]  This weaponized migration, Chuck and I were down there and Chuck Holton and I were down there in Morocco and he called up Frontex, which is the sort of the border patrol for Europe, which is essentially useless.
[02:23:32.341 --> 02:23:40.565]  But Frontex said that, you know, that Belarus was pushing aliens into Poland and Lithuania.
[02:23:41.105 --> 02:23:44.847]  And I had lived in Poland for two years and studied Poland quite a lot before that.
[02:23:44.967 --> 02:23:48.309]  And I didn't, I'm not Polish, but I, it was, there was reasons why I lived there.
[02:23:48.329 --> 02:23:51.471]  But, but the bottom line is, is I didn't think Poland would let them in.
[02:23:51.511 --> 02:23:52.491]  That's not their style.
[02:23:52.932 --> 02:23:53.632]  And they did not.
[02:23:54.032 --> 02:23:58.475]  But I called up the Lithuanian, some top people in the Lithuanian military.
[02:23:58.515 --> 02:24:00.476]  I was with them in Afghanistan and the Afghan war.
[02:24:00.856 --> 02:24:06.557]  And they said, hey, we were about to invite you to Lithuania because Belarus is pushing migrants over our border.
[02:24:06.657 --> 02:24:06.837]  Right.
[02:24:06.877 --> 02:24:08.438]  So I flew up to Vilnius with Chuck.
[02:24:08.758 --> 02:24:10.158]  I stayed there for about five weeks.
[02:24:10.198 --> 02:24:11.958]  They gave me full access to the camps.
[02:24:12.338 --> 02:24:13.519]  I was talking with the people.
[02:24:13.579 --> 02:24:21.220]  They were from all over Africa and the Middle East, many Yazidis and other Arabs also from from Iraq and Kurds as well.
[02:24:21.780 --> 02:24:26.682]  And I talked with many, many, many from Syria, all over the place, Nigeria, Gambia.
[02:24:27.102 --> 02:24:31.986]   And bottom line is, is Belarus was pushing those migrants.
[02:24:32.046 --> 02:24:33.546]  It was a weaponized migration.
[02:24:34.086 --> 02:24:36.947]  And I started publishing some things up here.
[02:24:37.407 --> 02:24:39.327]  Obviously, this is an indicator of war.
[02:24:39.987 --> 02:24:42.588]  For those who study war, you'll pick up on that immediately.
[02:24:43.288 --> 02:24:48.009]  It's like somebody stabbing you with a knitting needle and deeper and deeper.
[02:24:48.429 --> 02:24:50.810]  And that's what's happening here in the Bering Gap.
[02:24:51.210 --> 02:24:52.590]  United States is being invaded.
[02:24:52.610 --> 02:24:55.111]  Europe is being invaded from multiple fronts.
[02:24:55.171 --> 02:24:56.751]  It's not just one party doing it.
[02:24:57.511 --> 02:25:04.336]  But down here in the Darien Gap, this is the route through which you could get literally hundreds of millions of people through.
[02:25:04.356 --> 02:25:08.840]  I'll be very surprised if fewer than a million come through in 2024.
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:10.241]  I'll be very surprised.
[02:25:10.281 --> 02:25:11.181]  That'll be a low number.
[02:25:11.542 --> 02:25:16.305]  Last month, the Panamanian government announced 82,000 made it through the gap in August of 2023.
[02:25:17.546 --> 02:25:19.787]  This month, it'll be some number that's higher than that.
[02:25:19.827 --> 02:25:21.528]  We're seeing three or four thousand a day now.
[02:25:21.848 --> 02:25:23.189]  And this is during rainy season.
[02:25:23.489 --> 02:25:24.609]  It's very muddy out there.
[02:25:24.709 --> 02:25:26.570]  Usually, it decreases during this time of year.
[02:25:26.890 --> 02:25:28.851]  But month by month, the number goes up.
[02:25:29.111 --> 02:25:30.572]  I'm sorry, you wanted to say something, Maria?
[02:25:31.453 --> 02:25:33.614]  Well, I wanted to ask, where do you see this going?
[02:25:33.634 --> 02:25:34.914]  I mean, obviously, you're right.
[02:25:34.974 --> 02:25:36.555]  The numbers keep going up.
[02:25:38.545 --> 02:25:43.607]  Okay, so yes, how are these people going to be weaponised?
[02:25:43.627 --> 02:25:51.549]  You and I have spoken before about the fact that they come in, they're supplied with phones automatically, they're provided for.
[02:25:51.589 --> 02:25:58.531]  We've got the Plum Grove migrant housing facility.
[02:25:58.611 --> 02:26:08.941]   I can see In 2020, the population of Plum Grove was at 1,245 and now we've got one of these migrant cities there.
[02:26:08.961 --> 02:26:15.308]  The population is well over 50,000, I think even over 70,000 right now.
[02:26:15.348 --> 02:26:22.983]   So not only are we letting all these people in, we're housing them, we're giving them all these you know, resources. Meanwhile, you sent me something and
[02:26:22.983 --> 02:26:25.512]   if the team have got that, if they could bring up some of those images,
[02:26:25.512 --> 02:26:31.913]   meanwhile, we've got these people, violent criminals, killing their neighbors in cold blood.
[02:26:31.913 --> 02:26:37.712]   I mean, these are just some of the problems, but you say it's going to lead to war. How does it play out?
[02:26:37.712 --> 02:26:44.912]   Well, the details of course are in question, but in general terms, it's quite easy to predict.
[02:26:45.112 --> 02:26:49.912]   I mean, for instance, we have people from third world countries all over the world.
[02:26:50.572 --> 02:27:01.495]  I want to repeat, I know a lot of people who watch my work have heard me say this 20 times already, but I've spent about three quarters of my life now outside of the United States in more than 90 countries.
[02:27:01.515 --> 02:27:06.037]  And I mean, really been to those more than 90 countries, not just airplane stops.
[02:27:06.517 --> 02:27:09.679]  I'm constantly in these third world countries and developing countries.
[02:27:09.719 --> 02:27:18.042]  I spent a year in India, a year in and around China, a year in Nepal, just two years in Afghanistan, two in Iraq, just all over the place.
[02:27:18.102 --> 02:27:19.603]  I've been in so many countries, right?
[02:27:20.103 --> 02:27:24.205]  And I'm telling you, not all fish will mix well in the same aquarium.
[02:27:24.705 --> 02:27:30.688]  All you have to do is push all these incompatibles into our crumbling economy and Europe as well.
[02:27:31.108 --> 02:27:34.009]  Europe is collapsing and you will end up in a war.
[02:27:34.250 --> 02:27:39.004]   I mean, that's just The fish in the aquarium war, that's a weaponized use of migration.
[02:27:39.264 --> 02:28:00.314]   Now keep in mind, Stalin did this with Ukraine, he just weaponized, he basically made the farmers out to Kulaks, Which is basically, they did a big information war against the Kulaks, saying that they're evil, they're the reason you have the high prices, they're the reasons for this, they're the reasons for that.
[02:28:00.714 --> 02:28:02.475]  And basically said, go take their farms.
[02:28:02.715 --> 02:28:03.176]  Go take them.
[02:28:03.356 --> 02:28:04.296]  Go take them and they're yours.
[02:28:04.437 --> 02:28:06.298]  There was a huge famine in 1932 and 1933 called the Holodomor.
[02:28:09.108 --> 02:28:12.611]  Many people in Ukraine didn't even know there was a Fanlona in other parts of Ukraine, right?
[02:28:13.011 --> 02:28:15.953]  So, I mean, this sort of thing, this is what Mao did.
[02:28:16.013 --> 02:28:17.715]  He was a student of Stalin.
[02:28:17.975 --> 02:28:18.575]  He did the same.
[02:28:19.216 --> 02:28:23.399]  What you're showing there is the residence near Colony Ridge.
[02:28:23.799 --> 02:28:24.920]  We call it Abbott City.
[02:28:25.401 --> 02:28:27.923]  That's where the Mexican came over and shot the Hondurans.
[02:28:28.263 --> 02:28:29.864]  He was drunk, reportedly drunk.
[02:28:30.224 --> 02:28:32.126]  That's baby food for the baby he murdered.
[02:28:32.906 --> 02:28:35.467]  He came over and he was shooting his rifle at night.
[02:28:35.547 --> 02:28:36.828]  There's bullet holes in that door.
[02:28:36.868 --> 02:28:40.450]  That's Todd Bensman, my friend, the author of the book Overrun.
[02:28:41.090 --> 02:28:44.211]  And that's a memorial for the Hondurans who were murdered.
[02:28:45.132 --> 02:28:46.092]  That's a memorial.
[02:28:46.352 --> 02:28:54.176]  So basically this drunk Mexican, reportedly drunk, who had been deported numerous times.
[02:28:54.216 --> 02:28:54.816]  He's a criminal.
[02:28:55.376 --> 02:28:58.338]  He kept coming back like a boomerang to the United States.
[02:28:58.378 --> 02:29:03.818]   He was out firing his rifle at night, drunk, reportedly, and the neighbours complained,
[02:29:03.818 --> 02:29:05.418]  "Hey, you're keeping the babies awake."
[02:29:05.418 --> 02:29:09.378]   So he solved that by coming over there with his rifle and killing the baby and killing
[02:29:09.378 --> 02:29:10.378]  the rest of the family.
[02:29:10.378 --> 02:29:11.378]  Right?
[02:29:11.378 --> 02:29:12.378]  And so he...
[02:29:12.378 --> 02:29:13.378]  Michael, I don't want to cut you off.
[02:29:13.378 --> 02:29:14.378]  That's why that baby formula is there.
[02:29:14.378 --> 02:29:18.978]   It's such a shocking story, but we've got to go to break right now.
[02:29:18.978 --> 02:29:23.778]   I want to talk about the risk of this type of thing continuing and what else we can expect
[02:29:23.778 --> 02:29:25.177]  to see on the other side of the break.
[02:29:25.225 --> 02:29:25.885]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:29:26.346 --> 02:29:31.070]  We are back with war correspondent Michael Yon talking to us just before the break.
[02:29:31.110 --> 02:29:37.436]  He was talking about a massacre, a shocking, shocking massacre that happened earlier this year.
[02:29:37.836 --> 02:29:50.183]  And the reason why that's relevant is because it happened right near the largest illegal immigrant colonia, and the major US media said nothing about it at the time.
[02:29:50.203 --> 02:29:55.025]  A population of what was around 1,200 people, now well over 50,000.
[02:29:55.165 --> 02:29:57.266]  I think the latest numbers are about 70,000.
[02:29:58.607 --> 02:30:03.410]  Of these illegals in Plum Grove in Texas.
[02:30:03.910 --> 02:30:06.292]  And, you know, more coming all the time.
[02:30:06.672 --> 02:30:13.476]  And so Michael's talking to us about not only the behavior of these people and the attitude that they bring.
[02:30:13.516 --> 02:30:18.619]  This guy that committed this atrocity crossed the border illegally multiple times.
[02:30:19.659 --> 02:30:36.347]  So, to secure the border is absolutely crucial, but I just heard yesterday on this very broadcast, Michael, that there was a Border Patrol officer that was saying it's too, you know, to secure the border at this point is impossible because of the unbelievable amount of people coming in.
[02:30:36.387 --> 02:30:40.969]  The only solution is to start deporting people and punishing them, but Joe Biden isn't going to do this.
[02:30:42.461 --> 02:30:44.282]  No, it's child's play to secure the border.
[02:30:44.622 --> 02:30:45.522]  It's easily done.
[02:30:45.942 --> 02:30:49.844]  Now, I'm not saying that every drop of blood can be stopped coming across the border.
[02:30:50.184 --> 02:30:50.904]  That's untrue.
[02:30:51.324 --> 02:30:55.145]  But the vast majority of it is easily sealed, right?
[02:30:56.366 --> 02:30:58.026]  For instance, I'm down here in Panama again.
[02:30:58.046 --> 02:31:03.988]  Now, you'll hear Panamanians say frequently, we can't seal the Darien Gap, which is complete nonsense.
[02:31:04.509 --> 02:31:04.789]  Why?
[02:31:05.169 --> 02:31:07.270]  Because during the COVID lockdown, they sealed it.
[02:31:07.470 --> 02:31:08.630]  We know they did.
[02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:09.450]  Nobody got through.
[02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:11.231]  I mean, that thing was locked tight.
[02:31:12.283 --> 02:31:14.706]  It's very easy to seal if you have the will to do it.
[02:31:15.066 --> 02:31:18.670]  What I see around the world is every country blaming somebody else.
[02:31:19.230 --> 02:31:20.952]  Americans blaming the cartels.
[02:31:21.332 --> 02:31:22.353]  Blaming the Mexicans.
[02:31:22.854 --> 02:31:24.455]  Mexicans blaming the Guatemalans.
[02:31:24.695 --> 02:31:25.957]  Mexicans blaming Americans.
[02:31:27.078 --> 02:31:28.960]  Panamanians blaming Colombians.
[02:31:29.320 --> 02:31:31.222]  Colombians blaming Venezuelans.
[02:31:31.662 --> 02:31:34.203]  Moroccans blaming Spain and Spain blaming Morocco.
[02:31:34.343 --> 02:31:38.004]  Italy blaming various parties in Europe.
[02:31:38.744 --> 02:31:40.425]  Meanwhile, they're the ones doing it.
[02:31:40.745 --> 02:31:44.086]  If you throw corn on the ground, the ducks will come, right?
[02:31:44.106 --> 02:31:50.288]  I mean, you can't just say the United States is giving $2,200 a month to these people who make it across.
[02:31:50.648 --> 02:31:51.689]  That's a lot of corn.
[02:31:52.089 --> 02:32:02.595]   Not to mention, There's the hope that these people have when I talk with them coming through the Darien Gap and across the border when I'm at Yuma or across Texas or California or whatever.
[02:32:03.016 --> 02:32:07.439]  They all have been getting propaganda to go to the United States and you'll get free stuff.
[02:32:07.799 --> 02:32:12.242]  You'll get free passport, you'll get free medical, you'll get free school for your kids.
[02:32:13.102 --> 02:32:17.705]  It's not free obviously, it's destroying the United States and it's going to lead to war.
[02:32:17.725 --> 02:32:22.849]  A lot of the people coming through the Darien Gap and other places, the Darien Gap is just one feeder.
[02:32:23.109 --> 02:32:25.790]  But I'm going to tell you, there's a reason why I keep coming to Panama.
[02:32:25.830 --> 02:32:31.732]  People who've followed my work for 20 years know that if my feet are somewhere, it's somewhere important, right?
[02:32:32.072 --> 02:32:34.953]  I don't just run off to Netherlands because I like Netherlands.
[02:32:35.093 --> 02:32:40.495]  I do like Netherlands, and I do like Japan, and I do like Panama, but that's not why I'm here.
[02:32:41.015 --> 02:32:44.857]  And I don't spend so much time in Texas because I love Texas.
[02:32:44.977 --> 02:32:48.998]  Texas is great, but I'm in Texas because Texas is a future war zone.
[02:32:49.691 --> 02:32:50.171]  Straight up.
[02:32:50.631 --> 02:32:57.394]  And you'll see this criminality that you see with the murder of the five people on that instance.
[02:32:57.414 --> 02:32:58.234]  That's just one of many.
[02:32:58.474 --> 02:32:59.655]  This stuff is happening constantly.
[02:32:59.935 --> 02:33:02.256]  It's constantly one, two, three, four, five people killed.
[02:33:02.276 --> 02:33:03.016]  This is normal.
[02:33:03.316 --> 02:33:04.377]  It's day-to-day activity.
[02:33:04.677 --> 02:33:06.077]  A lot of it just doesn't hit the news.
[02:33:06.377 --> 02:33:08.638]  Police being assaulted all over the United States now.
[02:33:09.318 --> 02:33:14.000]  People being raped and murdered all the way from Sweden to Key West.
[02:33:14.140 --> 02:33:15.701]  I mean, it's happening everywhere, right?
[02:33:16.001 --> 02:33:22.608]  We've been warning about it, especially those of us who lived overseas for years and swim around in these other waters constantly.
[02:33:22.869 --> 02:33:23.930]  We know what's coming.
[02:33:24.110 --> 02:33:25.151]  It's going to be war.
[02:33:25.432 --> 02:33:26.373]  There's no way around it.
[02:33:26.693 --> 02:33:30.397]  When you mix certain things together, you get certain other things.
[02:33:30.437 --> 02:33:36.324]  For instance, if you reach, if you mix anger and disgust, you always get hatred, right?
[02:33:37.004 --> 02:33:37.325]  Always.
[02:33:37.505 --> 02:33:49.417]  That's the formula if you're an artist or a writer and you're trying to create hatred or you're an information warrior and you're trying to create hatred, you mix anger plus disgust and you get hatred, right?
[02:33:49.737 --> 02:34:03.127]   So when I'm in China and other places, not that they're going to let me back in after they kick me out of Hong Kong, but when I'm doing, when I'm studying museum warfare, for instance, museum warfare is just a firm that I made up because I go to a lot of museums and I
[02:34:03.127 --> 02:34:09.156]   study the messages that they're giving out, for instance, in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand,
[02:34:09.156 --> 02:34:10.607]  China, Hong Kong.
[02:34:10.607 --> 02:34:12.927]  Hong Kong has been absorbed now.
[02:34:12.927 --> 02:34:17.966]   I look at these museums and, for instance, when I flew to Nanjing, I looked at the museum
[02:34:17.966 --> 02:34:18.966]  there.
[02:34:18.966 --> 02:34:19.966]  It's a huge museum.
[02:34:19.966 --> 02:34:20.966]  This thing must cost $50 million.
[02:34:20.966 --> 02:34:24.527]   I don't know how much it costs, but it's like Disney World level.
[02:34:24.568 --> 02:34:25.568]  It's unbelievable.
[02:34:26.069 --> 02:34:31.831]  And the thing is, as somebody who studies Information War, I've written three books on Information War, by the way.
[02:34:31.891 --> 02:34:33.412]  Unfortunately, they're all in Japanese.
[02:34:33.432 --> 02:34:34.193]  They're not in English.
[02:34:34.573 --> 02:34:36.734]  Because I've been working for years to wake up the Japanese.
[02:34:37.435 --> 02:34:37.695]  Why?
[02:34:37.755 --> 02:34:40.577]  Because Japan is being targeted in an information war.
[02:34:40.617 --> 02:34:44.760]  If you want to know what's coming, always watch your enemy's information war.
[02:34:44.901 --> 02:34:45.501]  Info wars?
[02:34:45.861 --> 02:34:50.224]  I mean, I don't know when Alex came up with the idea of the term info wars, but it's brilliant.
[02:34:50.685 --> 02:34:54.267]  If you want to know what your enemy's going to do, watch their info wars, right?
[02:34:54.307 --> 02:34:55.188]  When did he come up with that?
[02:34:55.468 --> 02:34:57.590]  But anyway, but I mean, it's right on target.
[02:34:58.110 --> 02:35:03.433]  And like a lot of things that Alex came up with that used to sound crazy, they end up turning out to be.
[02:35:03.733 --> 02:35:09.896]  Who was the first one that came up with the idea that they were going to house people and children and whatnot in these super centers and whatnot?
[02:35:10.336 --> 02:35:13.097]  I mean, that sounded completely crazy just some years ago, right?
[02:35:13.438 --> 02:35:17.360]  Now we know it's an absolute fact, like in Brownsville, Texas, they're housing people in these things.
[02:35:17.640 --> 02:35:18.840]  Anyway, let me go back to China.
[02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:24.183]  So I was in this, I was going to museums in China and other places, and I was in the Nanjing Museum.
[02:35:25.189 --> 02:35:31.033]  Every step you take to that museum, and it's a long museum, is, is, and I was the only white guy there.
[02:35:31.453 --> 02:35:40.179]  Otherwise, it was almost all children, you know, all wearing their blue shirts, yellow shirts, red shirts, whatever, pink shirts, different buses had, there was hundreds and hundreds of children.
[02:35:40.499 --> 02:35:41.820]  So they were running through the buses.
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:45.562]  I flew to Nanjing just to go to the museum and look at their information warrant, right?
[02:35:46.122 --> 02:35:49.045]  And because they're clearly getting ready to do something to Japan.
[02:35:49.906 --> 02:35:51.207]  And eventually, right?
[02:35:51.667 --> 02:35:57.152]  And so every step of the way was creating disgust and hatred and anger against Japan.
[02:35:57.592 --> 02:36:03.577]  And interestingly, when I was about halfway through the museum, there wasn't a lot of places to get water or any food or anything like that.
[02:36:03.897 --> 02:36:06.339]  And the kids were starting to get tired and ornery.
[02:36:06.700 --> 02:36:09.962]  And when we were about halfway through, I thought, wow, this is a big museum.
[02:36:10.022 --> 02:36:11.223]  I'm glad it's almost over.
[02:36:11.504 --> 02:36:14.026]  I didn't realize it was only about halfway done, right?
[02:36:14.764 --> 02:36:21.448]  Well, if you want to deliver your message, an emotional message, first you have to get people in an emotional state.
[02:36:21.468 --> 02:36:30.232]  So you want to get them tired, you want to get them hungry, you want to get them thirsty, and you want to keep showing them photos of the people or the image of the thing that you want them to hate.
[02:36:30.652 --> 02:36:39.117]  So every time you turn, it's these disgusting pictures of Japanese doing this, that, and the other, and statements that would make you angry.
[02:36:39.137 --> 02:36:43.159]  And the statements are in English, and French, and Chinese, of course, and Mandarin.
[02:36:43.439 --> 02:37:03.961]  Basically the comparison here is that we're going to keep shoving gay stuff in your face, the US is going to have a gay military, we're going to dress men up as women, parade our clowns around, we're going to demoralize the country and make everyone hate it, make the whole world hate it.
[02:37:04.989 --> 02:37:11.733]  You know, portray the American people as some sort of, you know, sissies, which they're not.
[02:37:12.093 --> 02:37:28.523]  But, you know, you talk to any European country and they're just disgusted with what's being portrayed in the United States right now because they're just elevating all the gay stuff and, you know, all the trans stuff and just shoving the trans flag in your face above the United States flag.
[02:37:28.863 --> 02:37:41.567]  So basically what I'm hearing, Michael, is the comparison that you're drawing between how they've made people turn people against each other overseas and making people hate the United States and the people of America.
[02:37:41.587 --> 02:37:42.847]  Am I correct in my assumption?
[02:37:43.988 --> 02:37:44.428]  You are.
[02:37:44.668 --> 02:37:47.409]  The first time I started noticing this, I was late to the game.
[02:37:47.569 --> 02:37:49.309]  Alex noticed it years before that.
[02:37:49.349 --> 02:37:53.471]  But in 2014, I was covering the coup in Thailand and I was down in the middle.
[02:37:53.511 --> 02:37:54.931]  Hang on, Michael, we've got to go to break.
[02:37:56.186 --> 02:37:58.829]  Sorry, we've got to go to break in about 10 seconds.
[02:37:58.909 --> 02:38:08.381]  I want to hear more about this on the other side of the break and then I want to talk to you about this news from Australia, this dog king that's just resigned and how they're going to keep doing this.
[02:38:08.641 --> 02:38:09.282]  We'll be right back.
[02:38:09.927 --> 02:38:12.209]  All right, we're here with Michael Yon.
[02:38:12.229 --> 02:38:18.954]  I want to take a minute now just to talk about something crucial that just happened in the UK.
[02:38:19.454 --> 02:38:22.496]  They've just passed this bill, Michael.
[02:38:22.557 --> 02:38:29.322]  It's an online safety bill, you know, sort of talking about protecting people from anonymous trolls and things of this nature.
[02:38:29.342 --> 02:38:31.023]  They've introduced something similar in Australia.
[02:38:31.403 --> 02:38:46.568]  But really what it is is a censorship bill and essentially, you know, the penalties that they're looking for for big tech are the same as what we've seen, you know, a tenth of their global income, potentially criminal convictions for the senior leaders of big tech.
[02:38:46.988 --> 02:38:49.049]  And so it's so bad.
[02:38:49.571 --> 02:38:59.754]  That both Signal and WhatsApp have said we have to leave the UK because we can't, you know, we're not going to sit here and give the government access to people's private messages, which is what the bill demands.
[02:39:00.434 --> 02:39:17.306]   And it also, from my understanding, demands six months jail time for anyone that violates their so-called misinformation You know, whatever they deem to be misinformation at any moment, making the people terrified to speak out.
[02:39:18.246 --> 02:39:24.869]  And, you know, people have to go and verify themselves through this government app on their phone and all the other apps interact with this app.
[02:39:24.909 --> 02:39:28.711]  So essentially, it's a zero trust model, which is where the Internet is moving.
[02:39:29.391 --> 02:39:35.434]  And you are guilty until proven innocent through your compliance while you're online.
[02:39:35.454 --> 02:39:46.389]   And the reason I bring this up Is for everyone watching today for the Infowarriors, imagine a world where that was your reality and you didn't have Infowars.
[02:39:47.251 --> 02:39:52.778]  Imagine a world where you weren't able to hear the truth at all.
[02:39:52.999 --> 02:39:53.479]  That's it.
[02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:54.481]  The truth's dead.
[02:39:55.163 --> 02:40:03.026]  And so please support this broadcast, support InfoWars in whichever way you can, and let's keep the truth alive.
[02:40:03.086 --> 02:40:04.367]  Let's keep them in the fight.
[02:40:04.847 --> 02:40:11.710]  Michael, just yesterday we had the announcement of the resignation of Daniel Andrews, a dog king in Australia.
[02:40:11.730 --> 02:40:13.811]  Really, it doesn't matter.
[02:40:13.851 --> 02:40:28.610]   I mean, the whole country's celebrating, and I understand he's a horrible human being, so it makes sense that they would celebrate, but ultimately, These people are just installed to demoralize, to destroy society.
[02:40:28.810 --> 02:40:29.850]  It's on purpose.
[02:40:29.930 --> 02:40:31.811]  They want the world to hate their government.
[02:40:31.951 --> 02:40:32.732]  This is the truth.
[02:40:33.751 --> 02:40:46.056]  And so this actually ties in with what you're talking about in terms of leading the people to hate their government, to be at a point where they reach civil unrest, but they want the civil unrest.
[02:40:46.136 --> 02:41:00.322]  So how do we, as a people, or how do we, as those at the front lines of the information war, encourage people to fight back against this, but not fight back in the way that they want us to fight back?
[02:41:00.442 --> 02:41:02.343]  It's a precarious situation, Michael.
[02:41:04.099 --> 02:41:06.161]  Yeah, people are being taught to hate themselves.
[02:41:06.201 --> 02:41:07.321]  Like, look at Germans.
[02:41:07.461 --> 02:41:08.822]  I mean, they tend to hate Germany.
[02:41:10.404 --> 02:41:14.386]  Increasing numbers of Americans hate the United States, or Australians hating Australia.
[02:41:14.426 --> 02:41:19.590]  I was giving a speech in Tokyo some years ago, and it was a bunch of journalists and historians and that sort of thing.
[02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:26.415]  And I said, you know, I've been all over Asia, or let's say 25 countries in Asia, I don't know, 16, 18 years running around Asia.
[02:41:27.075 --> 02:41:33.458]  And I said, you know, when I go to different countries around the world, I ask certain questions.
[02:41:33.538 --> 02:41:34.598]  Do you trust your police?
[02:41:34.638 --> 02:41:35.659]  Do you trust your courts?
[02:41:35.999 --> 02:41:37.259]  What do you think of your military?
[02:41:39.398 --> 02:41:40.579]  What do you think of the United States?
[02:41:40.859 --> 02:41:41.920]  What do you think of Japan?
[02:41:42.121 --> 02:41:43.542]  I asked, what do you think of your neighbors?
[02:41:43.622 --> 02:41:45.984]  There's just a long list that I kind of go down.
[02:41:46.725 --> 02:41:48.166]  And it's interesting.
[02:41:48.366 --> 02:41:54.311]  So I was so I'm saying what I'm saying that to preface what I'm about to say that I said during the speech.
[02:41:54.852 --> 02:42:01.177]  I said, you know, I've been all Japanese seem to think that the entire world hates Japan.
[02:42:01.698 --> 02:42:06.242]  Now, I've been around the world and I've asked this question all over Asia and all over the world.
[02:42:07.282 --> 02:42:09.644]  What do you, which, and I asked the Japanese there.
[02:42:09.684 --> 02:42:11.806]  These are very educated people in the audience.
[02:42:11.866 --> 02:42:15.370]  I said, which, I've only found three countries that hate Japan.
[02:42:15.890 --> 02:42:16.891]  What are those countries?
[02:42:17.071 --> 02:42:17.312]  Right?
[02:42:17.472 --> 02:42:20.415]  And people are actually interacting, you know, like, oh, China.
[02:42:20.575 --> 02:42:20.895]  Okay.
[02:42:21.716 --> 02:42:28.082]  Actually, most Chinese seem to like Japan, but there is a program clearly designed to make Chinese hate Japan.
[02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:32.813]  Because that's what you need your population to hate the target so that you can kill them, right?
[02:42:33.433 --> 02:42:35.074]  And others said Korea, of course.
[02:42:35.094 --> 02:42:35.795]  And I said, okay.
[02:42:36.115 --> 02:42:38.917]  And then they started beating around North Korea, South Korea.
[02:42:38.957 --> 02:42:41.439]  I said, okay, just include North and South Korea as one.
[02:42:41.919 --> 02:42:43.660]  What's the third country, right?
[02:42:44.020 --> 02:42:44.921]  And nobody could get it.
[02:42:45.061 --> 02:42:46.802]  And I said, well, it's obviously Japan.
[02:42:47.122 --> 02:42:49.944]  I've never seen anybody hate Japan more than Japanese.
[02:42:50.325 --> 02:42:52.186]  And they almost gave me a standing ovation.
[02:42:52.526 --> 02:42:52.746]  Right?
[02:42:53.147 --> 02:42:56.849]  I said, I know, because it's the same way I lived in Germany for four years.
[02:42:56.909 --> 02:42:57.670]  I speak German.
[02:42:58.010 --> 02:42:59.891]  I lived in the United... I'm American.
[02:43:00.152 --> 02:43:01.513]  I've lived all over the United States.
[02:43:01.853 --> 02:43:06.056]  And it's like, nobody hates Americans more than Americans do.
[02:43:06.616 --> 02:43:11.339]  And it's because we've been... This is an information war that's teaching you to hate yourself.
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:11.900]  Right?
[02:43:12.340 --> 02:43:14.582]  This is where this Dog King stuff comes from.
[02:43:14.902 --> 02:43:21.727]   Dog King is an old information strategy that comes, for instance, when Swedish and Norwegian kings are Fighting and killing each other.
[02:43:22.107 --> 02:43:32.852]  You depose another king, run him off, kill him or whatever, and you install a dog as a king, give him a crown, give him a necklace, give him a throne, give him a translator, and now say, this dog is your king.
[02:43:33.172 --> 02:43:37.274]  And it demoralizes the people who are like, hey, our king's a dog.
[02:43:37.474 --> 02:43:38.595]  Yeah, well, that's your king.
[02:43:38.975 --> 02:43:40.296]  Serve your dog king, right?
[02:43:40.676 --> 02:43:42.537]  And it also emboldens your enemies.
[02:43:42.817 --> 02:43:49.060]  And that's what's happening when we have meat puppets like Biden, or in your case, Andrews down there.
[02:43:49.660 --> 02:43:55.125]  Uh, or, you know, Trudeau up in, or Ruth over in, uh, in Netherlands.
[02:43:55.385 --> 02:44:06.314]  To be clear, our Prime Minister is Anthony Albanese and he can't even speak properly, but... No, I mean, I mean, I'm talking about, I'm talking about the guy over, the guy in Queens, I think it was.
[02:44:06.414 --> 02:44:08.956]  No, not the Premier, the guy in Victoria, right?
[02:44:09.156 --> 02:44:09.917]  It's Andrews, right?
[02:44:11.502 --> 02:44:13.243]  Is he stepping down?
[02:44:13.263 --> 02:44:16.326]  What's happening to him?
[02:44:16.406 --> 02:44:21.831]  He resigned and people are saying it's because he's avoiding a Royal Commission.
[02:44:22.031 --> 02:44:25.874]  No one's avoiding a Royal Commission because the Royal Commission's not happening.
[02:44:25.914 --> 02:44:31.779]  The Prime Minister promised a COVID inquiry and now he's saying no, no, we're not going to do that.
[02:44:34.100 --> 02:44:49.364]  Yes, there are people calling for it, but the point is that you have this tiny minority, and it's the same problem in every country, Michael, this tiny minority calling for the right thing and very little support because people are being pulled left, right and centre to focus on this over here, that over there.
[02:44:49.404 --> 02:44:50.764]  There's so many distractions.
[02:44:51.084 --> 02:44:51.985]  I want to hear from you.
[02:44:52.025 --> 02:44:57.866]  Zone in on what the biggest problem is and what people should be focusing on because they want us distracted.
[02:44:59.802 --> 02:45:01.423]  I mean, you just said it, distraction.
[02:45:01.783 --> 02:45:05.426]  You know, when I go, when I return to the United States, I mean, that is key.
[02:45:05.486 --> 02:45:07.867]  I mean, that's, that's not just like a throwaway.
[02:45:08.147 --> 02:45:10.589]  That distraction is like, key.
[02:45:11.029 --> 02:45:19.114]  For instance, when I come back to the United States, and again, I still stay overseas most of the time, I come back to the United States, and I see my country on drugs.
[02:45:19.214 --> 02:45:20.755]  And I mean, literally on drugs.
[02:45:21.195 --> 02:45:25.499]  I mean, you know, I go to places like San Francisco and Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
[02:45:25.519 --> 02:45:32.284]  and I check into hotels and you smell marijuana in the halls and you smell it in the elevators.
[02:45:32.344 --> 02:45:37.909]  I smell it walking down the streets in Philadelphia and New York, Key West, a bunch of dope heads.
[02:45:38.249 --> 02:45:40.631]  Now, when I say that, people are like, oh, you're against marijuana.
[02:45:40.651 --> 02:45:43.013]  You know, when I was younger, I was more like live and let live.
[02:45:43.353 --> 02:45:50.659]  Now that I'm older and I've seen a lot more stuff around the world, I'm telling you right now, you're being taught to do this so that you can be killed.
[02:45:51.018 --> 02:45:54.538]   That's what this is all about, so that your throat will be slit.
[02:45:54.538 --> 02:45:58.538]   These people coming through the Darien Gap, they got high testosterone.
[02:45:58.538 --> 02:46:00.937]  They're going to come in and they're going to kill your ass.
[02:46:00.937 --> 02:46:03.978]  I mean, they are very serious people, right?
[02:46:03.978 --> 02:46:09.498]   And these are people that are coming into different ecosystems of people are coming in.
[02:46:09.647 --> 02:46:13.930]  You've got the Chinese coming in that are going into various ecosystems.
[02:46:14.190 --> 02:46:19.214]  There's not, you know, China is not obviously homogenous as people think.
[02:46:19.294 --> 02:46:22.917]  I mean, there's different, you know, there's Cantonese speakers, Fujianese speakers.
[02:46:22.937 --> 02:46:27.221]  I'm meeting a lot of Fujianese speakers, which will mean something to the Chinese watching this.
[02:46:28.061 --> 02:46:33.966]  But basically calling people Chinese is like calling people white almost, like, you know, Irish and Germans are not exactly the same, right?
[02:46:34.346 --> 02:46:36.968]  So even Irish and Irish are not exactly the same.
[02:46:36.988 --> 02:46:44.475]  You go up to Belfast and there's like a wall that's over 20 miles to keep the Protestants and the Catholics apart at nighttime.
[02:46:44.515 --> 02:46:46.076]  They actually still close the walls.
[02:46:46.357 --> 02:46:47.297]  You should see this wall.
[02:46:47.318 --> 02:46:48.038]  It's unbelievable.
[02:46:48.318 --> 02:46:55.665]  But the bottom line is information war is the key to making people fight each other, making people think it's cool and it's okay.
[02:46:55.965 --> 02:47:06.332]  You know, you've got Joe Rogan over there smoking a joint, you know, in front of millions of young people, like, well, if Joe Rogan smokes a joint with Elon Musk, I should be smoking a joint so that I can get my throat slit too, right?
[02:47:06.692 --> 02:47:12.075]  I mean, the bottom line, I'm telling you, there's some high testosterone people coming through all across our border.
[02:47:12.355 --> 02:47:17.859]  If you've come across all of South America and through the Darien Gap and all the way up through Mexico, you're not playing around.
[02:47:18.099 --> 02:47:19.740]  You're a very serious person, right?
[02:47:20.100 --> 02:47:27.425]  And these very serious people are coming into environments where people are all caught up in this LGBT nonsense.
[02:47:27.705 --> 02:47:29.186]  You know, you got people like Andy Noah.
[02:47:29.226 --> 02:47:31.068]  I spent a few days with him over in London.
[02:47:31.348 --> 02:47:32.909]  You know, hey, I'm a gay Asian.
[02:47:32.929 --> 02:47:34.430]  He loves to say, I don't care.
[02:47:34.790 --> 02:47:35.370]  You know what I mean?
[02:47:35.571 --> 02:47:37.132]  Get over the gay Asian stuff.
[02:47:37.532 --> 02:47:39.673]  You know, I mean, seriously, you're going to be in a fight.
[02:47:42.133 --> 02:47:43.034]  We've got to go to break.
[02:47:43.134 --> 02:47:46.159]  I hate to cut you off right now because what you're saying is so crucial.
[02:47:46.219 --> 02:47:47.100]  Keep that passion.
[02:47:47.460 --> 02:47:47.941]  Keep it up.
[02:47:48.362 --> 02:47:51.586]  We'll be back very, very soon, right after this.
[02:47:51.926 --> 02:47:57.714]  You know, right before the break, Michael Yon was talking about something that people always get upset at me for talking about, but I don't care.
[02:47:57.754 --> 02:47:58.676]  I'm going to tell you the truth.
[02:47:59.396 --> 02:48:06.939]  This isn't a war on marijuana and people's need for pain relief or, you know, whatever reasons people use it.
[02:48:06.999 --> 02:48:10.280]  I understand that CBD has amazing medicinal properties.
[02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:18.262]  What this is about is the fact that anything that the government approves, they do it because they know it's harmful for you.
[02:48:18.642 --> 02:48:23.344]  So in Canberra, for example, they're looking at legalising ecstasy.
[02:48:23.942 --> 02:48:28.724]  Because all of a sudden, ecstasy is really good for your mental health, you know?
[02:48:29.265 --> 02:48:40.510]  Never mind the fact that they were talking about the fact that it drains all your serotonin when you use it, and it, you know, over time it struggles to replenish, so it's going to make you depressed and suicidal eventually.
[02:48:40.550 --> 02:48:46.453]  No, no, no, we're going to legalise ecstasy because it's going to help you with your mental health, which is just a lie.
[02:48:46.473 --> 02:49:02.126]   And so what Michael's talking about is, you know, the way that culture and the government steer you towards just being distracted and having a great time while your country's being invaded and they're setting you up for civil war.
[02:49:03.027 --> 02:49:07.671]  And, you know, I think, Michael, we're at this crucial point and we're in this last segment now.
[02:49:07.691 --> 02:49:11.295]  So I want you to talk about, okay, two things are happening simultaneously.
[02:49:11.655 --> 02:49:16.120]  Number one, people are docile and they don't realize that they're being invaded as we speak.
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:20.044]  Number two, people are getting absolutely sick of what they're seeing.
[02:49:20.084 --> 02:49:22.808]  And you and I discussed this in the car when I was in the United States.
[02:49:23.649 --> 02:49:25.090]  It was a powerful conversation.
[02:49:25.110 --> 02:49:32.700]  So I want to continue that conversation now on air because they're pushing us to this point of civil unrest in every country.
[02:49:33.435 --> 02:49:38.154]   they want us there. What do the people need to do now? How do the people need to respond?
[02:49:38.154 --> 02:49:42.194]   Number one, to stop being docile and notice what the heck is going on on your home turf.
[02:49:42.194 --> 02:49:47.556]   And number two, to make sure that we don't respond how the globalists want us to. What
[02:49:47.556 --> 02:49:53.556]   do we need to be doing? Well, first of all, if you're just doing your job, sir, you know
[02:49:53.952 --> 02:49:58.796]  You're just a gear in the big bin and loading the buses, for instance, on the borders.
[02:49:58.956 --> 02:50:05.662]  If you're Border Patrol, I know a lot of Border Patrol watch your show because every time I'm on, I get a lot of messages.
[02:50:06.243 --> 02:50:08.465]  I'm talking with Border Patrol right now.
[02:50:09.125 --> 02:50:13.188]  If you're just loading the buses, just doing your job, that's what the Nazis did.
[02:50:13.528 --> 02:50:16.130]  You are feeding our own invasion.
[02:50:16.530 --> 02:50:30.499]  You're a gear in the clock, click, click, click, load the bus, and then the bus driver, click, click, click, he then drives the bus, or she drives the bus, takes them to the in-processing facility, they process them and release them on the streets.
[02:50:30.579 --> 02:50:31.259]  Now we're invaded.
[02:50:31.599 --> 02:50:32.300]  It's that simple.
[02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:33.861]  You're part of the system.
[02:50:34.201 --> 02:50:39.841]   If you're continuing to do that, Then you're doing what the Nazis did, and we hanged them for that.
[02:50:40.381 --> 02:50:42.922]  I'm not saying that you're evil or bad.
[02:50:43.102 --> 02:50:47.323]  I've talked with a lot of Border Patrol people that I think are actually good people.
[02:50:47.403 --> 02:50:48.483]  They don't know what to do.
[02:50:48.523 --> 02:50:53.264]  They're as confused as anybody else due to this information war in large part.
[02:50:53.624 --> 02:50:58.786]  Nobody has given clear instructions that this is the border that you are to defend.
[02:50:58.806 --> 02:51:03.867]  And if you're not going to defend it, at least don't facilitate it by helping the buses run.
[02:51:04.347 --> 02:51:07.108]  Or by pushing people like us back who have cameras.
[02:51:07.588 --> 02:51:14.570]  I mean, most of the Border Patrol are very professional, exceptionally professional actually, and want us to come down on the border and show this.
[02:51:15.050 --> 02:51:17.531]  Some of the Border Patrol are straight up aggressive.
[02:51:17.871 --> 02:51:21.352]  I mean, there's times when I thought I literally might get shot by Border Patrol.
[02:51:21.752 --> 02:51:25.774]  That's why I spent two weeks over on the Mexican side, not on the U.S.
[02:51:25.814 --> 02:51:26.134]  side.
[02:51:26.494 --> 02:51:27.394]  I'm like, what am I doing?
[02:51:28.094 --> 02:51:30.035]  If I'm going to get hurt, it's probably on the U.S.
[02:51:30.075 --> 02:51:30.335]  side.
[02:51:30.975 --> 02:51:33.076]  Sir, you're a U.S.
[02:51:33.176 --> 02:51:38.138]  citizen worried about getting hurt by the Border Patrol that's letting the illegals through.
[02:51:38.218 --> 02:51:39.578]  Is that what I'm hearing, Michael?
[02:51:39.918 --> 02:51:40.779]  This is disgusting.
[02:51:40.839 --> 02:51:41.359]  Oh, yeah!
[02:51:41.959 --> 02:51:48.662]  Other people like Todd Bensman or Chuck Holton or Ben Berkwam or so many others that have been on the border, there's a lot.
[02:51:49.802 --> 02:51:59.187]  Banner Steel, so many have been down there and been aggressively, you know, pushed back by by US Border Patrol or National Guard or whatever.
[02:51:59.487 --> 02:52:04.790]  There was one state senator down in, Tammy Nichols was her name.
[02:52:04.830 --> 02:52:10.874]  We were at gate 42 near El Paso one night and a Border Patrol almost hit her with a truck.
[02:52:10.894 --> 02:52:16.256]  I had to move her out of the way and he bumped two journalists and he intentionally did this.
[02:52:16.276 --> 02:52:18.938]  I had my video right in his face at the window.
[02:52:19.380 --> 02:52:20.448]  What a pathetic little man.
[02:52:22.156 --> 02:52:24.738]  He looks like he's on drugs.
[02:52:24.798 --> 02:52:25.919]  I've got all this on video.
[02:52:25.939 --> 02:52:27.020]  I've got it on video.
[02:52:27.561 --> 02:52:29.642]  And the police did nothing.
[02:52:30.143 --> 02:52:41.853]  So we've got these pathetic men who obviously, you know, thrive on a power trip because they're not able to really, you know, be real men, otherwise they would be doing the right thing.
[02:52:44.195 --> 02:52:48.418]  But we have good border patrol that watch this show, that watch you, that watch this broadcast.
[02:52:48.879 --> 02:52:50.460]  What do these people need to be doing?
[02:52:52.140 --> 02:52:54.723]  Stop helping the invasion of the United States.
[02:52:55.084 --> 02:52:55.444]  Stop.
[02:52:55.784 --> 02:53:00.309]  If your job is to commit treason, stop committing treason and do your duty.
[02:53:00.870 --> 02:53:01.851]  Do your duty.
[02:53:02.212 --> 02:53:03.973]  And that means stop loading the buses.
[02:53:04.294 --> 02:53:12.303]  If Border Patrol across the board says we're not loading the buses, in fact, we're going to start blocking the people that are coming in because we know this is an invasion.
[02:53:12.603 --> 02:53:12.803]  Right?
[02:53:13.243 --> 02:53:17.024]  I mean, we know we got people coming through the Darien Gap now with no passport.
[02:53:17.225 --> 02:53:18.865]  They're going right down this road right in front of me.
[02:53:18.905 --> 02:53:21.446]  Highway 1 is a main invasion route to the United States.
[02:53:21.466 --> 02:53:24.167]  They go straight into Costa Rica without showing a passport.
[02:53:24.447 --> 02:53:27.168]  I see people at Yuma, Chinese coming through.
[02:53:27.568 --> 02:53:30.789]  I've got it on video that I made with the phone that I'm talking on right now.
[02:53:31.309 --> 02:53:35.913]  And the Border Patrol is like, what's your name and what's your birthday?
[02:53:36.213 --> 02:53:37.194]  He's not even asking.
[02:53:37.394 --> 02:53:40.717]  He's not even asking for their passport or papers or anything at all.
[02:53:41.017 --> 02:53:42.438]  He's just asking Chinese.
[02:53:42.658 --> 02:53:44.559]  You should see how well the Chinese are dressed.
[02:53:44.620 --> 02:53:46.761]  I was just looking at some of the videos and photos last night.
[02:53:47.101 --> 02:53:50.164]  Very well dressed, like they just are on vacation.
[02:53:50.524 --> 02:53:54.106]  And they're just coming across the border at Yuma around that, you know, fence.
[02:53:54.387 --> 02:53:55.147]  You might have been there.
[02:53:55.848 --> 02:54:00.491]  And the Border Patrol's just loading them up on the bus, not even asking for any paperwork.
[02:54:00.791 --> 02:54:02.052]  You can't make up this stuff.
[02:54:02.512 --> 02:54:06.014]  Stop doing your job when it's clearly destroying the United States.
[02:54:07.315 --> 02:54:12.559]  If your commander tells you, well, your job is to go ahead and set that city on fire, are you going to do it?
[02:54:12.959 --> 02:54:14.120]  You know that's wrong.
[02:54:14.420 --> 02:54:15.381]  It's morally wrong.
[02:54:15.421 --> 02:54:16.401]  It's ethically wrong.
[02:54:16.461 --> 02:54:17.502]  It's legally wrong.
[02:54:17.842 --> 02:54:18.883]  And you're just doing it?
[02:54:19.343 --> 02:54:19.684]  I mean, stop!
[02:54:20.724 --> 02:54:21.165]  Stop.
[02:54:21.705 --> 02:54:22.125]  Stop.
[02:54:22.786 --> 02:54:24.147]  Stop loading the buses.
[02:54:24.507 --> 02:54:25.908]  Stop driving the buses.
[02:54:26.449 --> 02:54:30.151]  Stop being a gear in the cog that's destroying our country.
[02:54:30.512 --> 02:54:31.873]  They're going to kill you.
[02:54:32.253 --> 02:54:33.714]  They're going to come to your homes.
[02:54:33.994 --> 02:54:36.336]  This has happened over and over and over in history.
[02:54:36.356 --> 02:54:41.079]  For instance, in Ukraine in 32, 33, and around that, and all over the Soviet Union.
[02:54:41.560 --> 02:54:44.202]  Happened in China, happened in Canada, all over the world.
[02:54:44.602 --> 02:54:49.566]  I mean, where people come in and they take- But it's happened- And they're told to take their homes, to take them.
[02:54:51.007 --> 02:54:52.487]  It's happened on American soil.
[02:54:52.527 --> 02:54:56.088]  Not so much take their homes just yet, but that's what they're saying in Europe.
[02:54:56.349 --> 02:54:59.950]  The Pope even just said, no, no, Europe doesn't have a migration problem.
[02:55:00.630 --> 02:55:03.111]  You know, open your doors to these migrants.
[02:55:03.431 --> 02:55:08.412]  Meanwhile, people are getting raped on the streets and women can't walk safely.
[02:55:08.452 --> 02:55:10.573]  But you know, we don't have a migration problem.
[02:55:10.813 --> 02:55:15.354]  They're telling people, maybe it's time to start opening your own home to migrants.
[02:55:15.634 --> 02:55:17.295]  So it is absolutely happening in Europe.
[02:55:17.315 --> 02:55:18.335]  But what's already happened?
[02:55:19.565 --> 02:55:20.726]  Well he is a fool.
[02:55:20.906 --> 02:55:23.748]  The Pope is a fool.
[02:55:24.549 --> 02:55:25.410]  He knows what he's doing.
[02:55:25.430 --> 02:55:27.311]  He does not denounce Catholic Charities.
[02:55:27.652 --> 02:55:31.275]  Catholic Charities is a massive child smuggler right there in Texas.
[02:55:31.655 --> 02:55:32.736]  I'm out there with them all the time.
[02:55:32.796 --> 02:55:35.978]  I've been over and seen their operations in Mexico as well.
[02:55:36.279 --> 02:55:37.820]  They are a massive child smuggler.
[02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:39.761]  We have a great deal of video.
[02:55:40.161 --> 02:55:44.103]  And the Border Patrol often are taking instructions from, we got this on video.
[02:55:44.343 --> 02:55:46.204]  This isn't me talking, I can give you the video.
[02:55:46.524 --> 02:55:54.307]  Border Patrol and local law enforcement, they're near McAllen, Texas, taking clear instructions from Catholic Charities.
[02:55:54.647 --> 02:55:56.548]  I mean, you can't make up, we got it on video.
[02:55:56.908 --> 02:55:57.909]  Very clear audio.
[02:55:58.249 --> 02:55:59.209]  Super clear video.
[02:55:59.609 --> 02:56:01.090]  And as clear as we're talking now.
[02:56:01.570 --> 02:56:03.911]  And they're just like, who's Catholic Charities?
[02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:07.260]  Child smugglers!
[02:56:07.860 --> 02:56:08.381]  I mean, seriously.
[02:56:08.401 --> 02:56:10.441]  Let me just say this, Michael.
[02:56:11.381 --> 02:56:17.363]  Let me just wrap this up because we've only got a couple of minutes left today and we could talk all day.
[02:56:17.543 --> 02:56:32.630]   But what I want to say is, bottom line, what the people need to be doing right now is, you know, the invasion at the border, I would say Along with freedom of speech, these two things are kind of top priority in the United States right now.
[02:56:33.550 --> 02:56:36.092]  And you know, if you disagree with me, let me know.
[02:56:36.172 --> 02:56:42.956]  But ultimately, if you don't have freedom of speech, you can't report what's really happening at the invasion center.
[02:56:44.237 --> 02:56:44.978]  Which is the border.
[02:56:45.298 --> 02:56:54.184]  So anyone who's able to get involved really does need to demand any staff that are there facilitating this start pushing back.
[02:56:54.444 --> 02:56:57.086]  Not push back, just absolutely stop complying with this.
[02:56:57.326 --> 02:56:58.787]  The answer is always the same.
[02:56:58.847 --> 02:57:01.449]  The answer is always mass non-compliance.
[02:57:01.829 --> 02:57:05.071]  What are you gonna do when everyone says no?
[02:57:05.412 --> 02:57:07.533]  What are you gonna do when everyone says no?
[02:57:07.893 --> 02:57:10.355]  So, I mean, these people need to get organised, Michael.
[02:57:11.236 --> 02:57:20.783]  People that are able to offer up their free time to assist with this invasion and the people that are employed to facilitate this invasion.
[02:57:21.143 --> 02:57:25.606]  Everyone needs to get involved and put an end to this immediately.
[02:57:26.086 --> 02:57:31.811]  Biden, the sock puppet for Obama, is not going to do anything.
[02:57:32.371 --> 02:57:36.094]  Demanding that he takes action isn't going to do anything.
[02:57:37.296 --> 02:57:38.959]  Last 20 seconds, Michael.
[02:57:39.640 --> 02:57:40.802]  Where can people follow you?
[02:57:40.962 --> 02:57:42.425]  And we'll definitely do a follow-up.
[02:57:44.262 --> 02:57:45.003]  They can follow me.
[02:57:45.043 --> 02:57:47.825]  I'm on X every day, the formerly known as Twitter.
[02:57:47.925 --> 02:57:49.606]  I'm on Locals every day.
[02:57:50.487 --> 02:57:52.708]  And you can support my work with gifts and go.
[02:57:52.768 --> 02:57:55.030]  I never, you know, I'm terrible at fundraising.
[02:57:55.070 --> 02:57:59.093]  I'm one of the worst in the world because I, in my culture, we shouldn't shouldn't ask.
[02:57:59.193 --> 02:58:00.213]  And so I rarely do.
[02:58:00.574 --> 02:58:02.635]  But this is very expensive gifts and go.
[02:58:04.096 --> 02:58:05.717]  And, and, and that's it.
[02:58:05.797 --> 02:58:13.526]   I'm constantly rolling down range, whether it's, well, whether it's Iraq or Afghanistan or God bless you, Michael.
[02:58:13.847 --> 02:58:15.209]  We are out of time today.
[02:58:15.250 --> 02:58:16.612]  Thank you so much for your time.
[02:58:16.973 --> 02:58:17.955]  Michael's give, send, go.
[02:58:17.995 --> 02:58:19.178]  His Twitter's up on the screen.
[02:58:19.258 --> 02:58:19.779]  God bless.
[02:58:19.859 --> 02:58:21.322]  We'll see you all very, very soon.
