[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:07.771]  It gives you no pleasure to see what you said was coming to have arrived.
[00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:13.052]  Because, you know, people say, how did you know?
[00:00:14.172 --> 00:00:18.133]  But my answer to that is, because it's not random.
[00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:26.595]  You know, if you're saying this is what's going to happen, and it's all random, well, what's the chances of you getting it right or anything close to being right?
[00:00:27.242 --> 00:00:30.044]  You get it right because it's a plan.
[00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:33.327]  And if you uncover the plan, you can predict the future.
[00:00:33.988 --> 00:00:36.550]  But you're not actually predicting the future.
[00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.236]  You're predicting the future if there's no intervention by humans on the plan.
[00:00:44.182 --> 00:01:06.333]  And so the more this plays out in the way that you kind of say this is what is planned and it happens, it's a bit disappointing really because the idea is, the idea of what I do, what we do, is to alert enough people to stop that happening, to make sure it doesn't play out.
[00:01:07.097 --> 00:01:12.938]  And like I said earlier, though, it has to get really bad to concentrate enough minds.
[00:01:13.518 --> 00:01:16.579]  And we are moving into that area now.
[00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:24.360]  I mean, after Covid, more and more people came, but more and more people will when they start to see that actually it's not a myth.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.340]  It's not a theory.
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.421]  It's actually happening.
[00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:32.182]  But it's like I say, I want to emphasize that it's not about predicting the future.
[00:01:32.202 --> 00:01:34.322]  It's about predicting the plan.
[00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:39.217]  And the idea is the plan doesn't become the future because enough people intervene.
[00:01:40.178 --> 00:01:42.940]  So to answer the question, it gives you no...
[00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:45.219]  Satisfaction, really.
[00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:55.102]  I mean, it does give you confidence that you're on the right track and that what you're doing and how you're researching and how you're coming across all this is valid because it turns out that it's true.
[00:01:55.762 --> 00:01:57.783]  But it's not something you want to be.
[00:01:58.063 --> 00:02:09.606]  I mean, I don't want to be here a few years from now, as I will be, by the way, and having this chat and saying, well, you know, people are now being connected to AI en masse.
[00:02:09.646 --> 00:02:11.227]  You know, I told you that was coming.
[00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:14.368]  That's no satisfaction at all.
[00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:22.151]  If you can avoid it happening by human intervention, that's the real reason we do what we do, of course.
[00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:23.091]  And I totally agree.
[00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:28.253]  What you said, I've interviewed you probably 50 times, been very blessed to be at some of the same events as you and have dinner with you.
[00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:31.154]  When we cover Bilderberg together and some other times.
[00:02:31.674 --> 00:02:33.415]  But what you just said is the most important thing ever.
[00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:35.375]  We're not predicting the future.
[00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:42.358]  It's a set plan that if we let them continue to hijack the train or the plane, we're going to go to the destination they want.
[00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:44.179]  But of course, none of it's random.
[00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:49.461]  We're able to predict what's going to happen once we study their operations because they are in somewhat control now.
[00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:51.642]  But more and more, they're not in control.
[00:02:51.982 --> 00:02:53.263]  And that's for the most important part.
[00:02:53.303 --> 00:02:53.783]  We're not just...
[00:02:54.423 --> 00:02:55.844]  We don't hijack bystanders here.
[00:02:55.904 --> 00:03:02.769]  If we get engaged and informed, we collectively can take control of our destiny together and take it away from these people.
[00:03:07.512 --> 00:03:12.335]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:03:12.276 --> 00:03:14.276]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:03:14.276 --> 00:03:34.276]  [Music]
[00:03:34.557 --> 00:03:36.198]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.901]  You know, my dad had an expression.
[00:03:39.921 --> 00:03:48.148]  He used to say, you know your success as a parent when you turn and look at your child and realize they turned out better than you.
[00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:59.757]  There's no way of knowing how it got there or whose it is, but it appears that cocaine has been found at the White House.
[00:04:00.672 --> 00:04:04.614]  We have a yellow bar stating cocaine.
[00:04:04.654 --> 00:04:05.495]  Hide your forehead.
[00:04:05.535 --> 00:04:05.915]  Yes!
[00:04:06.695 --> 00:04:13.198]  I would like to know blow by blow who is responsible for this.
[00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.460]  Too soon.
[00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:19.021]  Indeed, cocaine.
[00:04:19.041 --> 00:04:21.883]  Now again, this is part of an ongoing investigation.
[00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:29.447]  I can't even fathom anything like this having been found before in the West Wing and I go back to the 70s at the White House.
[00:04:30.043 --> 00:04:33.047]  A piece of crack cocaine.
[00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:37.413]  No bigger than this quarter that I'm holding in my hand.
[00:04:38.014 --> 00:04:39.195]  One quarter of one dollar.
[00:04:39.496 --> 00:04:44.242]  We passed a law that says, you're caught with that, you go to jail.
[00:04:45.345 --> 00:04:56.454]  I spent more time on my hands and knees, picking through rugs, smoking anything that even remotely resembled crack cocaine.
[00:04:56.914 --> 00:04:57.675]  Come on, man!
[00:04:57.695 --> 00:05:00.277]  I think there's a lot of cheap shots taken at Hunter Biden.
[00:05:00.317 --> 00:05:01.338]  He's a recovering addict.
[00:05:01.478 --> 00:05:02.118]  It's not funny.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.521]  I like it!
[00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.360]  Cocaine is a serious drug.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:18.545]  The big question, Andrea, is for how long had this item, which was described as a small dime-sized bag, been in this location?
[00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:23.567]  That's like saying to you, before you got in this program, you're taking tests where you're taking cocaine or not.
[00:05:23.587 --> 00:05:24.288]  What do you think, huh?
[00:05:24.608 --> 00:05:28.750]  The president is proud to have restored the rule of law.
[00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:54.670]   There is a super viral video of a woman flying out of a flight in Dallas who believes she
[00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.430]  saw a man turn into a reptoid.
[00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:06.430]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:05:57.508 --> 00:06:02.512]  She's a good looking woman, comes off as very credible, doesn't look like your classic schizophrenic.
[00:06:03.853 --> 00:06:08.696]  And other people on the plane said that the guy's face was glitching out and doing weird stuff.
[00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:31.532]  Now there's obviously crazy people that see things that don't exist, but I know a lot of really prominent people, and I've alluded to this the last few months, that are seeing similar things, and that's kind of one reason we're having this big awakening happening, is very cogent, very serious, very successful, well-known people are basically seeing other people glitch out and turn into basically demons or reptile-like creatures.
[00:06:32.904 --> 00:06:34.345]  And it's a big phenomenon.
[00:06:34.425 --> 00:06:35.625]  It's gone on for a long time.
[00:06:36.406 --> 00:06:37.946]  I've been trying to get David Icahn for a month.
[00:06:37.987 --> 00:06:38.887]  He's a very busy guy.
[00:06:38.907 --> 00:06:41.388]  He agreed to come on last week today.
[00:06:42.109 --> 00:06:44.890]  So we're lucky and blessed to have David Icahn.
[00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.271]  This is such a huge story.
[00:06:48.632 --> 00:06:49.532]  I don't know what's going on.
[00:06:51.073 --> 00:06:59.337]  There's also weird hologram type systems out there where people can wear like hologram belts or you can be in a room and then a hologram can make somebody's face do that to mess with folks.
[00:06:59.397 --> 00:07:01.238]  Basically magician type stuff.
[00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:06.213]  But this is happening more and more and more and more.
[00:07:07.233 --> 00:07:12.075]  And at some point, some of these prominent people are gonna start going public, but it's just super weird.
[00:07:12.856 --> 00:07:14.677]  Now, I don't normally get into conspiracy theories.
[00:07:14.777 --> 00:07:17.038]  I cover real stuff they call conspiracy theories.
[00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:19.839]  We're gonna be hitting plenty of that today.
[00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:28.163]  But David Icke does join us in the second and third hour, so we'll get to hear about a lot more of this.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:40.023]  Obviously with him, but he's going to want to get into the Russia situation and the global government and the global currencies and what's happening with Biden, what's happening with 5G.
[00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:43.804]  I want to get his take on Elon Musk and so much more.
[00:07:43.844 --> 00:07:45.985]  This is a big broadcast.
[00:07:46.045 --> 00:07:49.386]  Every broadcast is big, but this one is big, big, big.
[00:07:50.787 --> 00:07:55.068]  Every broadcast is on fire, but this is fire on fire on fire.
[00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.552]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Band.video.
[00:08:01.073 --> 00:08:03.955]  We are tomorrow's news today.
[00:08:05.296 --> 00:08:06.076]  You got me!
[00:08:06.096 --> 00:08:10.199]  And I know you got me, New World Order.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.501]  And now I'm about to get out of your grip.
[00:08:12.961 --> 00:08:13.902]  So watch this!
[00:08:14.842 --> 00:08:16.864]  Ha ha ha!
[00:08:16.884 --> 00:08:16.944]  Woo!
[00:08:19.325 --> 00:08:22.367]  It's Thursday, July 6th.
[00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:26.441]  2023.
[00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:26.441]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:29.543]  Couldn't have a better time to have David Icke on.
[00:08:29.583 --> 00:08:30.643]  This was set up a week ago.
[00:08:32.485 --> 00:08:36.647]  Trending number one on Twitter last night was people turning into reptoids in front of folks.
[00:08:37.268 --> 00:08:38.889]  People always say I'm the guy that says that.
[00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:40.009]  No, I'm not the guy that says that.
[00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:40.710]  That's David Icke.
[00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:45.293]  But almost everything David Icke has said has come true, so I think he's a very credible person.
[00:08:45.813 --> 00:08:49.756]  I think this attack on humanity is very alien, very anti-human.
[00:08:51.072 --> 00:09:02.699]  He'll be joining us coming up in the second and third hour, and he was already coming on about the central bank digital currencies and the ESGs and the war in Ukraine and all the insane GMO and cross-human-animal hybrids and all of being admitted.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.742]  But I'd imagine he'll want to talk about that.
[00:09:06.782 --> 00:09:12.025]  I'll certainly bring the big viral video of the green hoodie man on the flight out of Dallas yesterday.
[00:09:12.045 --> 00:09:13.787]  It's now gone super viral.
[00:09:13.807 --> 00:09:16.428]  We'll definitely raise that for him coming up next hour.
[00:09:16.969 --> 00:09:20.611]  Okay, let me be a good boy and just list the stacks here that we'll be hitting.
[00:09:25.245 --> 00:09:33.371]  I've got the most insane clips, but I'm not going to play them all, because I already spent 25 minutes this morning wasting my time watching, but they're super entertaining.
[00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:51.683]  Because the controlled corporate dinosaur press, who denied that the government's coordinating with big tech to censor and surveil and control people, now come out and said, of course we're surveilling you and censoring you, and we need the FBI to censor harder!
[00:09:52.344 --> 00:09:53.385]  How dare this judge!
[00:09:54.787 --> 00:09:55.788]  Stop our censoring.
[00:09:56.869 --> 00:10:03.095]  So now that a judge has said this is going on, do you need a judge to say the sun came up this morning?
[00:10:03.155 --> 00:10:03.956]  Apparently so.
[00:10:04.456 --> 00:10:06.818]  Now they're all, oh no, this is terrible!
[00:10:07.339 --> 00:10:11.202]  We have to suppress the right wing, they're so dangerous, they're so everywhere.
[00:10:12.623 --> 00:10:16.547]  They'll say only a man and a woman can have babies, or X and Y chromosomes are real.
[00:10:17.268 --> 00:10:19.230]  They'll stop us from cutting little children's genitals off.
[00:10:20.194 --> 00:10:30.700]  Big report though by Jamie White, Infowars.com, CNN, MSNBC, and a bunch of others freak out over judge blocking Biden regime from coordinating censorship with big tech.
[00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:33.062]  Whole bunch of videos.
[00:10:33.082 --> 00:10:33.562]  They're incredible.
[00:10:33.882 --> 00:10:34.683]  I've got a few of them.
[00:10:34.723 --> 00:10:35.263]  I can't help it.
[00:10:35.283 --> 00:10:37.945]  I'm going to play a few coming up bottom of the hour.
[00:10:39.226 --> 00:10:41.267]  Then we have Biden officially filing an appeal.
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.342]  Saying, oh, we just want to talk to big tech.
[00:10:45.622 --> 00:10:46.883]  And that's the new media spin.
[00:10:47.704 --> 00:10:50.947]  Biden admin to appeal order limiting contact with social media companies.
[00:10:51.247 --> 00:10:52.568]  No, they can have contact.
[00:10:52.828 --> 00:10:54.610]  You just can't say this is disinfo.
[00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:55.130]  Take it down.
[00:10:57.712 --> 00:11:01.075]  Here's the list of federal government agencies ordered to stop censoring speech.
[00:11:01.115 --> 00:11:02.196]  We're going to go over those for you.
[00:11:02.556 --> 00:11:03.397]  It's quite the list.
[00:11:03.437 --> 00:11:05.458]  I've already told you all about it before, but now it's official.
[00:11:06.739 --> 00:11:09.942]  State Department cancels Facebook meetings that were judged censorship ruling.
[00:11:11.986 --> 00:11:19.148]  And CNN and MSNBC are saying this censors the First Amendment, not letting the government order people to censor.
[00:11:19.328 --> 00:11:21.589]  So, that stacks bottom of the hour.
[00:11:22.289 --> 00:11:22.849]  Very important.
[00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:26.030]  Then we've got a bunch of news on the poison shots.
[00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.291]  Major Israeli study.
[00:11:29.351 --> 00:11:32.892]  Massive death increase in the nursing homes of those that took the shots.
[00:11:33.332 --> 00:11:35.033]  The more shots you take, the more you die.
[00:11:35.313 --> 00:11:36.413]  Erases your immune system.
[00:11:36.873 --> 00:11:39.554]  Israeli nursing home study shows evidence of vaccine deaths.
[00:11:41.974 --> 00:11:43.395]  Here's the actual study.
[00:11:44.436 --> 00:11:46.978]  For TV viewers, if you want to go pull it up.
[00:11:47.318 --> 00:11:51.102]  We're going to be getting into all of that today as well.
[00:11:51.982 --> 00:11:58.588]  Bill Ackerman, one of the top Wall Street investors, one of the top gurus, amplifies RFK Jr.
[00:11:58.628 --> 00:12:01.350]  and COVID vaccines, says, looks like vaccines are hurting people.
[00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.012]  So the rats are leaving the sinking ship very, very quickly.
[00:12:05.305 --> 00:12:07.566]  We have a Fauci compilation of his incredible lies.
[00:12:08.347 --> 00:12:12.709]  We have more brainwashing about how we've got to make children wear masks.
[00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:14.050]  We've got Zuckerberg.
[00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.532]  Remember this video from two years ago, warning employees don't take the shot in a leaked video?
[00:12:19.032 --> 00:12:19.753]  That's coming up.
[00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:21.734]  I'm gonna hit that this hour.
[00:12:22.294 --> 00:12:23.535]  We'll hit both these stacks.
[00:12:24.275 --> 00:12:27.297]  Then there's the old transgender gaslighting stack.
[00:12:29.138 --> 00:12:30.819]  This is a real headline, BBC.
[00:12:32.555 --> 00:12:38.659]  A young boy was raped by multiple six-foot-two, six-foot-five men dressed as women.
[00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:45.143]  And the headline is, boy left unclothed after Burgess Hill sexual assault by two women.
[00:12:47.104 --> 00:12:48.645]  So they're stealing women's identities now.
[00:12:49.925 --> 00:12:50.986]  Isn't that disgusting?
[00:12:51.626 --> 00:12:59.351]  And they're now saying that the shooter, the Philadelphia mass shooter, was a man and a Trump supporter, even though the person was a Democrat and transgender.
[00:13:04.141 --> 00:13:07.082]  We'll be hitting all of that news as well.
[00:13:07.823 --> 00:13:13.565]  We've also got the Hunter Biden cocaine news and video surfacing of him last week at the White House out on the balcony.
[00:13:14.145 --> 00:13:19.067]  If anybody, he looks like he's on a bunch of methamphetamine, not just cocaine.
[00:13:19.107 --> 00:13:25.010]  I mean, he's climbing the walls, skitzing out, bombed out of his brain.
[00:13:27.566 --> 00:13:29.508]  And there's a whole bunch of these.
[00:13:29.528 --> 00:13:34.051]  I mean, he is just absolutely climbing the walls here.
[00:13:34.071 --> 00:13:40.156]  I mean, that's what somebody looks like on when they just smoked methamphetamine.
[00:13:41.597 --> 00:13:47.702]  I mean, he is on a bunch of drugs whacked out of his brain with the rest of his drug addict family.
[00:13:48.003 --> 00:13:55.829]  And Dan Bongino, who's a former high-level Secret Service agent, explains why there's zero chance White House cocaine brought in by anyone other than the family.
[00:13:57.521 --> 00:14:01.823]  And oh, finally, mainstream media, CBS News Today, said what we told you days ago.
[00:14:02.203 --> 00:14:03.163]  It is cocaine.
[00:14:03.203 --> 00:14:04.504]  They weren't sure until now.
[00:14:05.884 --> 00:14:06.885]  That's all coming up.
[00:14:08.045 --> 00:14:11.626]  Some really good news that's really not new news to our viewers and listeners.
[00:14:13.567 --> 00:14:30.443]   Major Harvard study finds the root of mental illness is not chemical imbalances, not lack of toxic drugs, but lack of key natural compounds in food Like PQQ and CoQ10 that help with the health of the mitochondria.
[00:14:30.463 --> 00:14:31.183]  What else does that?
[00:14:31.844 --> 00:14:32.304]  Iodine.
[00:14:32.904 --> 00:14:33.925]  What else does that?
[00:14:34.945 --> 00:14:35.426]  Turmeric.
[00:14:35.566 --> 00:14:51.523]   Big study where the drugs actually hurt you and natural compounds is what your brain needs and they're curing people of depression and schizophrenia with Those natural compounds.
[00:14:51.743 --> 00:14:53.124]  Very interesting information.
[00:14:53.144 --> 00:14:55.766]  We already knew it, but there it is in a massive Harvard study.
[00:14:55.866 --> 00:14:57.567]  Also told you Newsom's going to be the guy.
[00:14:58.908 --> 00:15:00.309]  Mainstream media now all over the place.
[00:15:00.329 --> 00:15:01.930]  Politico, New York Times, Washington Times.
[00:15:02.931 --> 00:15:07.854]  Newsom being set to replace Biden as Democrats' presidential nominee.
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:15.863]  And of course you knew, France set to abolish all freedom, all freedom of speech, and all freedom to be surveilled.
[00:15:15.963 --> 00:15:22.146]  France set to allow police to spy through your phones, after letting all the Islamic Senate, letting them uprise.
[00:15:23.247 --> 00:15:24.107]  Isn't that disgusting?
[00:15:24.987 --> 00:15:33.232]  And so much more, we have the Deimos Group explaining that they will program your digital tokens, through the ESG's, the Central Bank Digital Currencies.
[00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:37.574]  That's all coming up, and so much more today.
[00:15:38.349 --> 00:15:43.389]   And of course, really the biggest issue is, Zelensky has now officially said that they're sure the
[00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:48.829]   Russians have planted bombs in the reactor, and then when they leave the largest nuclear reactor in
[00:15:48.829 --> 00:16:04.349]   Europe, the Zaporoizhenskaya, when they leave that super-fragilistic facility,
[00:16:04.349 --> 00:16:09.349]   that they have intel the Russians have loaded the reactors to explode,
[00:16:09.349 --> 00:16:14.349]   and NATO must invade now, or the Russians are going to create something bigger than Chernobyl.
[00:16:15.001 --> 00:16:16.682]  Does anyone believe the Russians have the motive for that?
[00:16:17.903 --> 00:16:18.523]  Would they do that?
[00:16:18.543 --> 00:16:19.484]  Why would they become the villain?
[00:16:19.844 --> 00:16:28.949]  Well, they're clearly being set up to be the villain, and if you don't think the deep state neocon New World Order won't pull something like that, well, you'll believe anything, my friends.
[00:16:29.009 --> 00:16:31.491]  So, very serious situation.
[00:16:33.154 --> 00:16:36.599]  Zelensky also says 200,000 children missing during the war.
[00:16:36.819 --> 00:16:37.580]  Oh, I'm sure.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.642]  The EU and NATO.
[00:16:41.294 --> 00:16:44.657]  NATO and the UN have famously been caught being the main smugglers of children worldwide.
[00:16:45.017 --> 00:16:51.963]  Let's look up UN caught trafficking, kidnapped children, UN sex slavery, UN murdered children, UN snuff films.
[00:16:52.524 --> 00:16:57.288]  You'll have to go into Google Web and dig back because they try to hide it, but it's mainstream news.
[00:16:59.129 --> 00:17:00.770]  They're the main suspect in all of this.
[00:17:00.851 --> 00:17:03.152]  We'll be talking about that as well.
[00:17:03.813 --> 00:17:04.313]  Big.
[00:17:04.854 --> 00:17:05.214]  Big.
[00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:08.636]  Thursday, broadcast van dot video.
[00:17:08.716 --> 00:17:13.799]  Please go to InfoWars.com forward slash show and share that link with everybody you know to the live feed.
[00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:17.661]  I want to commend and salute all of you that are sharing the links and articles and videos.
[00:17:17.981 --> 00:17:19.241]  You are the game changers.
[00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:20.262]  You are the resistance.
[00:17:21.683 --> 00:17:34.609]  Bill Gates has been quarterbacking with the Department of Energy for more than 20 years, a secret program by adding chemicals to jet fuel to create an aerosol spray that creates nuclei and clouds to block out the sun.
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.803]  The CIA began to declassify it eight years ago.
[00:17:38.903 --> 00:17:40.024]  We've played their press conference.
[00:17:41.045 --> 00:17:42.526]  We, of course, have been totally vindicated.
[00:17:44.528 --> 00:17:53.458]  And now Bill Gates with the White House has gotten Greenlight to go publicly operational with a program to, quote, block out the sun.
[00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:55.260]  That's the joke.
[00:17:58.376 --> 00:18:03.421]  They tell you, hey, put up your solar panels, and they block out the sun.
[00:18:05.503 --> 00:18:15.952]  Well, here's Osward Prasad, who's a big New World Order globalist at the Davos Group, and he's the author of The Dollar Trap.
[00:18:17.655 --> 00:18:21.198]  He's a cheerleader for the end of the dollar.
[00:18:21.218 --> 00:18:26.503]  And if you know what that means, that means a major drop in US standard of living.
[00:18:26.663 --> 00:18:31.147]  Most estimates are around 50% for the average person.
[00:18:31.187 --> 00:18:35.371]  So the death of the dollar is also the end of the American empire.
[00:18:36.392 --> 00:18:37.253]  But that's what they're setting up.
[00:18:37.313 --> 00:18:39.756]  NATO and this whole global order now is the new force.
[00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:41.766]  Well, the U.S.
[00:18:41.806 --> 00:18:50.830]  has basically sucked dry resources to establish it, and China is set up as the new command base for a monopolar world, with the U.S.
[00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.592]  taking a junior position backseat.
[00:18:54.232 --> 00:18:57.473]  And so all the other big news going on is a side issue to the U.N.
[00:18:57.513 --> 00:18:59.594]  treaties, the world government, the U.N.
[00:18:59.614 --> 00:19:07.198]  announcing it wants permanent emergency powers over every country, over energy, over transportation, over medical, over currency.
[00:19:07.438 --> 00:19:09.879]  That's all in the new official announcements.
[00:19:12.073 --> 00:19:13.874]  And it's not even secret, it's out in the open.
[00:19:14.434 --> 00:19:25.421]  And with that is the ESG, the social credit score, the universal basic income after they bankrupt everybody basically, the general public, and the central bank digital currencies that are programmable.
[00:19:25.841 --> 00:19:34.987]  And here he is saying that we won't let you buy ammunition, drugs, or pornography.
[00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:43.404]  And of course, it'll start with ammunition, drugs, pornography, and then, oh, you can't buy steak with that, but don't worry, we'll let you spend your credits on bug protein.
[00:19:44.524 --> 00:19:45.584]  You will eat the bugs.
[00:19:45.664 --> 00:19:46.345]  You will own nothing.
[00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:46.905]  You will have nothing.
[00:19:46.925 --> 00:19:47.405]  You will like it.
[00:19:47.745 --> 00:19:50.606]  These are quotes out of their mouths.
[00:19:51.246 --> 00:19:56.568]  And why would anybody that works in the system, either corporate or private, want to go along with this?
[00:19:56.728 --> 00:19:58.869]  You can pretend you're part of the power structure, but you're not.
[00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:11.489]   And now everybody From Russell Brand, to Ice Cube, to Ice-T, to you name it, to Bill Maher, he's coming out against the New World Order.
[00:20:11.969 --> 00:20:29.501]  Prince Harry went to a 4th of July parade and was basically seen saluting the American flag while his so-called father, he's not really the son of King Charles, which I think is a plus, was being crowned again the King of Scotland.
[00:20:30.387 --> 00:20:34.210]  So maybe there is some soul to Harry, but we'll see.
[00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:37.933]  But here's Aswar Prasad.
[00:20:37.993 --> 00:20:38.493]  Here it is.
[00:20:39.574 --> 00:20:46.960]  And the one final note I will make is that if you think about the benefits of digital money, there are huge potential gains.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.202]  It's not just about digital forms of physical currency.
[00:20:50.242 --> 00:20:55.546]  You can have programmability, you know, units of central bank currency with expiry dates.
[00:20:56.007 --> 00:21:01.218]   You could have, as I argue in my book, a potentially better and some people might see it as a
[00:21:01.218 --> 00:21:04.987]   darker world where the government decides that units of central bank
[00:21:04.987 --> 00:21:07.326]   money can be used to purchase some things
[00:21:07.326 --> 00:21:13.798]   but not other things that it deems less desirable like say ammunition or drugs or pornography or something of
[00:21:13.798 --> 00:21:19.768]   the sort and that is very powerful in terms of the use of a CBDC
[00:21:19.768 --> 00:21:23.137]   so there you go It's here.
[00:21:23.297 --> 00:21:23.778]  The U.S.
[00:21:23.818 --> 00:21:24.338]  has announced it.
[00:21:24.358 --> 00:21:25.478]  The Federal Reserve has announced it.
[00:21:25.498 --> 00:21:26.298]  The private Federal Reserve.
[00:21:26.659 --> 00:21:27.439]  The EU has announced it.
[00:21:27.479 --> 00:21:28.459]  It's all being set up.
[00:21:28.499 --> 00:21:29.840]  The first phases of the U.S.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.040]  system was rolled out last week.
[00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:34.601]  Very, very dangerous.
[00:21:35.281 --> 00:21:36.222]  Very, very serious.
[00:21:36.402 --> 00:21:39.803]  And remember, we warned you about this decades ago.
[00:21:39.823 --> 00:21:42.964]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though we were reading what the U.N.
[00:21:43.064 --> 00:21:46.465]  and the IMF and the World Bank wanted to do.
[00:21:48.306 --> 00:22:12.484]   Now, Let's go ahead and get into the situation with the federal ruling that the Biden administration is illegally working with Big Tech, which is a fact, to surveil, that's the first point,
[00:22:13.672 --> 00:22:25.634]  And then with government-corporate collusion, censor and block hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of posts alone on Facebook.
[00:22:26.534 --> 00:22:27.574]  That's just some of the data.
[00:22:29.755 --> 00:22:30.835]  Absolutely essential.
[00:22:31.575 --> 00:22:32.175]  A big deal.
[00:22:32.235 --> 00:22:37.336]  And they are in free-fall panic mode over all of this right now.
[00:22:38.236 --> 00:22:45.130]   And then I'm going to get into the nuclear false flag that Appears to be imminent.
[00:22:45.951 --> 00:23:02.455]  You have the president, the dictator, that's what he is now, of Ukraine, saying the Russians will blow up the nuclear power plant, the biggest in Europe, imminently, with no evidence.
[00:23:02.955 --> 00:23:04.096]  And the Russians, of course, are denying it.
[00:23:04.336 --> 00:23:10.137]  They say, we're pulling back to our positions in the part of Ukraine we've taken permanently for security.
[00:23:10.838 --> 00:23:11.918]  And that's always been our mission.
[00:23:13.618 --> 00:23:14.278]  And we're pulling back.
[00:23:15.518 --> 00:23:22.400]  And there's international advisors there, international observers there, and they're saying they're not seeing this happen.
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:33.082]  But Zelensky says that his special forces have seen the Russians planting bombs on the buildings, on the reactors.
[00:23:33.222 --> 00:23:36.722]  I mean, if that was true, that is a war crime of war crimes.
[00:23:37.042 --> 00:23:39.683]  Why would Russia commit this in front of the world?
[00:23:40.913 --> 00:23:44.649]  Remember that I tried to say Osama's using chemical weapons and it turned out the West was trying to frame him?
[00:23:46.977 --> 00:23:56.060]  So these maniacs will stop at nothing, and Zelensky admitted they attacked the dam in a test a month before they blew it up, then blamed it on Putin.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.101]  He said Putin blew up the bridge, even though he took credit for it.
[00:23:59.561 --> 00:24:01.702]  Zelensky took credit for blowing up the bridge, and then said Putin did it.
[00:24:02.122 --> 00:24:03.882]  He also says Putin blew up the Nord Stream Pipeline.
[00:24:03.902 --> 00:24:07.864]  I mean, do you believe anything this cokehead liar says?
[00:24:08.884 --> 00:24:11.285]  Is that a prerequisite to take cocaine and be one of these guys?
[00:24:12.245 --> 00:24:15.147]  The left always says, we think Alex Jones is on cocaine, he's got so much energy.
[00:24:15.907 --> 00:24:17.769]  No, I'm a depressant guy, I've got so much energy.
[00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:20.631]  I like alcohol and I need to control that, and I do most of the time.
[00:24:21.391 --> 00:24:23.633]  But you zombies don't get it.
[00:24:23.693 --> 00:24:24.433]  You need energy.
[00:24:25.554 --> 00:24:26.695]  You need drugs that give you that.
[00:24:26.795 --> 00:24:28.736]  I get it from natural compounds that are in nature.
[00:24:29.236 --> 00:24:30.757]  And I do, it's late at night and I'm tired.
[00:24:30.777 --> 00:24:34.360]  You take a natural stimulant, I'll take RainForce Ultra or RainForce Plus.
[00:24:35.697 --> 00:24:38.982]  I do not take turbo force, because it's just too strong for me.
[00:24:39.022 --> 00:24:42.347]  It's 10 hours, and it's just too much, and so I don't take it.
[00:24:42.408 --> 00:24:45.412]  So, if you want those, by the way, they're back in stock.

[00:25:15.081 --> 00:25:18.481]   The federal government admitting that most major water supplies
[00:25:18.481 --> 00:25:20.722]  are full of deadly toxic waste.
[00:25:20.704 --> 00:25:22.505]  Nearly half of the tap water in the U.S.
[00:25:22.605 --> 00:25:29.768]  is contaminated by forever chemicals that reduce fertility and bend gender, says the federal report that CNN's reporting on.

[00:25:53.258 --> 00:25:53.638]  Stay with us.
[00:25:55.379 --> 00:25:57.620]  All right, I want to get into the ruling last Friday.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:03.383]  It only got picked up in the media, I guess, by Monday, end of the holiday.
[00:26:05.299 --> 00:26:08.920]  Or I guess the judge issued it, but it didn't officially go out until July 4th.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:14.262]  So quite the message from the judge there on July 4th on Tuesday.
[00:26:14.282 --> 00:26:25.845]  A saying, you cannot illegally spy on the American people, surveil them, to then censor them and have government coordination with corporations.
[00:26:25.885 --> 00:26:27.125]  That is beyond illegal.
[00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:28.165]  It's election meddling.
[00:26:28.565 --> 00:26:29.566]  It's completely criminal.
[00:26:29.686 --> 00:26:30.526]  Don't do it anymore.
[00:26:32.527 --> 00:26:33.347]  So a slap on the wrist.
[00:26:34.369 --> 00:26:42.393]  But still, what the judge said, calling it Orwellian, the judge called it the Ministry of Truth was being established, that's what we've called it, because that's what it is.
[00:26:42.413 --> 00:26:50.338]  I mean, you read 1984, that was George Orwell's idea that if the Soviets ever took over the UK, that's what it would look like.
[00:26:50.578 --> 00:26:57.042]  And of course, he was one of the top socialists, Fabian socialist, top propagandist at the BBC during World War II.
[00:26:57.422 --> 00:27:02.765]  So he was one of them, and decided they were evil and went public against them and wrote a bunch of essays.
[00:27:03.919 --> 00:27:08.941]  He went ahead and islanded off Scotland for a year and wrote 1984 and then died right after it, by the way.
[00:27:09.362 --> 00:27:22.468]  Some folks think he probably didn't die of tuberculosis and was killed, but the issue is, is that he was a major insider and he described what they've set up as the Ministry of Truth and that's what the judge is saying here.
[00:27:22.528 --> 00:27:29.291]  So I want to get into that and this big July 4th ruling against tyranny in a moment.
[00:27:30.862 --> 00:27:32.623]  But I want to go back to Zelensky here.
[00:27:32.663 --> 00:27:34.524]  I was going to get to this later, but let's hit this now.
[00:27:35.285 --> 00:28:02.884]   Because my producer, Scott, came in here and he said, notice that Zelensky is saying, and I'm playing b-roll of his video statement, the whole thing's on Infowars.com, that the Russians have announced they're pulling out next week out of the Zaporoizhia Nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe.
[00:28:04.465 --> 00:28:10.628]  And the Russians have, quote, allowed in, since they took it over a year and a half ago, foreign observers.
[00:28:12.209 --> 00:28:22.235]  International Atomic Energy Agency people are there, the UN's there, and they allowed the engineers that were there, when they took it over, to stay there and be paid.
[00:28:23.156 --> 00:28:35.480]   And the Russians have now said, we're leaving next week, we're already sending most of our people this week, We're pulling out to Eastern Ukraine that we've taken, that Russia says they're going to keep.
[00:28:37.001 --> 00:28:42.206]  And we advise those of you that want to go with the Russians to go with us.
[00:28:42.226 --> 00:28:48.953]  Because it turns out most Ukrainian engineers are not pro-Zelensky and they reportedly want to go with the Russians.
[00:28:49.574 --> 00:28:51.216]  But there's concern for a handover.
[00:28:52.642 --> 00:29:00.225]  How does Zelensky, that said the Russians blew up their big bridge from Russia to Crimea, remember that?
[00:29:01.805 --> 00:29:04.586]  Now, the Ukrainians came out and celebrated that they blew it up.
[00:29:05.106 --> 00:29:06.187]  With the help of MI6.
[00:29:08.407 --> 00:29:10.168]  And then they turned around later and said the Russians did it.
[00:29:11.068 --> 00:29:12.048]  Their own supply bridge.
[00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:19.191]  That's like I'm in a battle and I take my own rifle and just put a buzzsaw to it and cut it in half.
[00:29:21.508 --> 00:29:23.169]  Or, I want to live so I shoot myself in the head.
[00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:31.931]  Then, Zelensky says the Russians blew up their own Nord Stream pipeline, the very day the new EU pipeline opened.
[00:29:34.612 --> 00:29:38.213]  Zelensky then said that the Russians, a month ago, blew up that dam.
[00:29:38.913 --> 00:29:49.757]  But then we pulled up New York Times articles saying, oh, the incredible Ukrainians fired two missiles into the dam to test to see if they could take it out, and they're thinking about taking it out.
[00:29:52.702 --> 00:29:59.085]  So the Ukrainians are so ham-fisted in their propaganda with the CIA that they don't think we can't look at what they said a month before.
[00:30:01.066 --> 00:30:03.067]  Biden says, we're going to get rid of the Nord Stream Pipeline.
[00:30:03.608 --> 00:30:04.248]  It won't be there.
[00:30:05.889 --> 00:30:07.170]  So does April Gillespie.
[00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.091]  I mean, so does Victoria Nuland.
[00:30:09.711 --> 00:30:13.593]  They all sit there and tell you what they're going to do.
[00:30:15.376 --> 00:30:17.758]  And then when they do it, they turn around just to insult you.
[00:30:18.018 --> 00:30:18.639]  It's like Biden.
[00:30:18.659 --> 00:30:20.120]  In fact, I didn't see this on the list.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:20.680]  Maybe it's there.
[00:30:21.501 --> 00:30:22.362]  Maybe I didn't send it to you.
[00:30:22.402 --> 00:30:25.404]  Biden laughs when asked about cocaine at the White House.
[00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:27.566]  It's all about arrogance.
[00:30:27.606 --> 00:30:36.354]  So we have this huge history about Snake Island and the ghost of Kiev and just all these stories that were not true.
[00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:58.397]  And now we're told the Russians would go against their motive, become villains, blow up the biggest reactor in Europe, arguably the world, have something much worse than Chernobyl, turn the entire planet against the Russians, bring in NATO, when the Russians are getting what they want, eastern Ukraine, as a buffer zone.
[00:30:59.498 --> 00:31:10.880]   So Scott makes the point from what Zelensky says, and I've got the transcript right here, That he has information from their intelligence services that they've seen the Russians planning bombs.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.541]  Here it is right here.
[00:31:12.943 --> 00:31:21.274]  That they've seen the Russians planning bombs on the roof of the reactor shells, the cooling towers.
[00:31:23.257 --> 00:31:27.280]  The fallout domes, in case they melt down, it supposedly keeps it contained.
[00:31:28.201 --> 00:31:33.024]  The reactor shells, the core protectors.
[00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:34.746]  What's the technical name?
[00:31:34.806 --> 00:31:35.746]  It'll pop in my head in a minute.
[00:31:37.087 --> 00:31:44.393]  The point is, that if you were going to blow up a reactor, you'd put the bomb inside, plus you wouldn't be seen doing it.
[00:31:45.374 --> 00:31:52.199]  But if you put it up on the roof, oh, our special forces have seen the Russians planting bombs on the roof.
[00:31:54.181 --> 00:32:15.320]   Now if you're Zelensky and you're planning to use missiles to do it, so there's plausible deniability, and so the witnesses, you just can't have Ukrainians take over in front of the engineers and plant bombs, but you can missile it from a distance now in the middle of the night, and say, see, Putin blew up The power plant, and now the whole world turns against Russia.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:25.784]  And it doesn't matter how stupid this is, or how it doesn't hold water, they are the exact type of lunatic globalist, with this coke head, Zelensky, that would try this type of stuff.
[00:32:28.025 --> 00:32:33.987]  Ukraine's spy chief accuses Russia of mining cooling pond at the nuclear plant.
[00:32:35.507 --> 00:32:38.068]  The Zaporozhskaya plant.
[00:32:38.969 --> 00:32:39.769]  And I know I'm butchering that.
[00:32:42.239 --> 00:32:43.000]  And it goes on and on.
[00:32:44.321 --> 00:32:52.729]  Ukrainian President Zelensky announced that he is under the impression that Russian forces will destroy the nuclear power plant which is under Russian control.
[00:32:53.469 --> 00:32:56.372]  Russia has told staff to leave the plant by July 5th.
[00:32:58.193 --> 00:33:00.055]  Now we have information from our intelligence.
[00:33:00.095 --> 00:33:08.082]  Zelensky said on Twitter that the Russian military has placed objects resembling explosives on the roof of several power units of the nuclear power plant.
[00:33:08.991 --> 00:33:11.313]  Perhaps to simulate an attack on the plant.
[00:33:11.773 --> 00:33:12.574]  Oh, to blame them.
[00:33:12.954 --> 00:33:14.755]  Perhaps they have some other scenario.
[00:33:14.796 --> 00:33:22.602]  But in any case, the world sees, can't but see, that the only source of danger to the power plant is the Russians and no one else.
[00:33:24.523 --> 00:33:27.245]  Boy, sounds like they're getting ready to stage a false flag, doesn't it?
[00:33:28.226 --> 00:33:28.846]  No, you know what?
[00:33:29.807 --> 00:33:33.250]  I believe, Zelensky, Putin blew up Nord Stream Pipeline.
[00:33:34.551 --> 00:33:35.572]  Putin blew up the dam.
[00:33:35.952 --> 00:33:36.953]  Putin blew up the bridge.
[00:33:37.373 --> 00:33:42.316]  Show the bridge from Russia to Crimea.
[00:33:43.017 --> 00:33:47.139]  Just type into YouTube, bridge to Crimea truck bombed.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.741]  And let's show what Putin did.
[00:33:50.501 --> 00:33:51.562]  I agree with Zelensky.
[00:33:52.163 --> 00:33:54.044]  Putin blew up his own bridge.
[00:33:54.104 --> 00:33:54.684]  That's right.
[00:33:55.505 --> 00:33:57.786]  Even though Zelensky took credit, but later said Putin did it.
[00:33:58.247 --> 00:33:58.647]  It's true.
[00:33:59.567 --> 00:34:00.908]  I believe what Zelensky says.
[00:34:01.428 --> 00:34:03.107]  We should only believe what Zelensky says.
[00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:13.027]  So Russia told her to be out by yesterday.
[00:34:13.264 --> 00:34:16.665]  They say they'll be out completely by next Monday.
[00:34:19.806 --> 00:34:21.846]  And who has a motive?
[00:34:21.986 --> 00:34:22.987]  Ukraine is desperate.
[00:34:23.647 --> 00:34:27.228]  The globalists always expand wars or launch wars on the backs of false flags.
[00:34:28.871 --> 00:34:50.992]  And the same New World Order that carried out 9-11, the same New World Order that's opened up the borders of Europe to Islam, and that's funding all these riots, the same group that blew up the bridge to Crimea, the same ones that blew up the Nord Stream Pipeline, the same ones that blew up the dam, are getting ready to blow up their own nuclear power plant, and blame the Russians to bring in NATO and have a full-scale continental war.
[00:34:51.732 --> 00:34:52.333]  That's what's happening.
[00:34:54.054 --> 00:35:03.672]   Because Zelensky doesn't Wipe his little rear end without asking the CIA, MI6, and others what to do.
[00:35:04.253 --> 00:35:05.774]  It's all being directed out of the Pentagon.
[00:35:06.114 --> 00:35:07.595]  They administrate it out of the Pentagon.
[00:35:10.317 --> 00:35:17.443]  And this is where we are right now in the middle of this psychotic, insane, out-of-control, illegal behavior.
[00:35:17.463 --> 00:35:31.151]   Or, I can ignore all the previous evidence of Ukraine working with the West, The US, the people that run our country, blowing up the pipeline, Nord Stream, cutting off our pipelines too, don't forget that.
[00:35:31.171 --> 00:35:33.312]  Dissolving our borders too, don't forget that.
[00:35:33.692 --> 00:35:34.793]  Cutting our kids' genitals off, don't forget.
[00:35:34.813 --> 00:35:36.293]  I mean, they're out to get us folks, people that run our government.
[00:35:36.693 --> 00:35:39.334]  So our government bragged they're going to blow up the pipeline and did.
[00:35:40.735 --> 00:35:45.137]  The Ukrainians fired test missiles and hit the dam so we can blow it up anytime we want, then they blow it up later.
[00:35:46.057 --> 00:35:51.039]  The Ukrainians have been shelling and attacking the power plant, the nuclear plant complex, for a year plus.
[00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:52.940]  And now they say the Russians are going to blow it up.
[00:35:56.096 --> 00:35:59.118]  And all the rest of it, and we're to believe that the Russians are going to do it.
[00:35:59.198 --> 00:35:59.498]  Okay.
[00:36:00.959 --> 00:36:17.347]  All right, well I guess then when the Russians blow up the nuclear power plant next week and rain radiation down everybody, I guess we've got to have all our able-bodied sons and daughters sign up for the draft and just let's have a full-scale nuclear war right now all based on Zelensky that plays the piano with his penis on TV.
[00:36:19.127 --> 00:36:20.387]  That makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?
[00:36:21.167 --> 00:36:23.468]  But don't worry, he's the only cokehead in the group.
[00:36:23.708 --> 00:36:26.588]  It's not Hunter Biden and his dad's a well-known drug addict as well.
[00:36:30.329 --> 00:36:36.130]  A pack of crackhead lunatics is what we're dealing with.
[00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:40.491]  All right, huge guest coming up, David Icke, next hour.
[00:36:41.231 --> 00:36:45.192]  Couldn't be more perfect timing having him on with all of the crazy stuff going on.
[00:36:45.512 --> 00:36:45.852]  Look at this.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.381]  Reptilian shapeshifter theories make woman's plane encounter even creepier.
[00:36:54.222 --> 00:36:55.042]  That's coming up.
[00:36:55.903 --> 00:36:57.083]  That's the least of our problems.
[00:36:57.804 --> 00:37:04.166]  It's like the original Twilight Zone, William Shatner, where the gremlins on the wing.
[00:37:07.307 --> 00:37:08.448]  That's the least of our problems.
[00:37:09.228 --> 00:37:16.051]  We don't know if that's real, but we do know Zelensky's a maniac and getting ready to blow up the largest nuclear power plant in Europe that's operational.
[00:37:18.197 --> 00:37:20.457]  All right, let's shift gears into some good news here.
[00:37:22.458 --> 00:37:54.657]   On the 4th of July, the judge publicly entered his ruling against Joe Biden and Obama in the deep state where they were illegally surveilling the entire internet using NSA tools and giving access to thousands of executives at the major big tech companies To be on a government corporate intelligence dashboard in a live time, not just surveilling your public posts, but reading your emails, your private messages, and more.
[00:37:54.858 --> 00:37:59.302]  Think of just the industrial espionage capabilities of what these guys are doing.
[00:38:00.672 --> 00:38:01.793]  A ticket to commit crime.
[00:38:02.294 --> 00:38:07.939]  And the judge said this is 1984, this is a Ministry of Truth, this is totally illegal from the documents the judge has.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:20.411]  And the MSM, the corporate media, went from denying that government does spy on you and does censor you, to saying of course they do, it's for everyone's safety.
[00:38:22.449 --> 00:38:24.149]  So I'm going to play some of these clips.
[00:38:24.169 --> 00:38:25.450]  I mean, there are dozens of these.
[00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.950]  But we've got clips.
[00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:29.071]  Let's play clip eight first.
[00:38:29.731 --> 00:38:36.613]  This is MSNBC's Ryan Riley argues the FBI isn't policing social media enough.
[00:38:37.273 --> 00:38:48.796]  Then we have other clips where they are upset the Biden administration and the FBI have been barred because they say we should not allow people to criticize or undermine the government.
[00:38:48.876 --> 00:38:49.996]  That should be illegal.
[00:38:52.691 --> 00:38:53.752]  I mean, we got a bunch of these.
[00:38:53.852 --> 00:38:58.835]  I mean, on a scale of 1 to 10, rhetorically, this is as bad as it gets.
[00:38:59.255 --> 00:39:02.438]  We can't allow you to undermine the government that lies to you.
[00:39:02.898 --> 00:39:05.760]  We've got to silence you or the bad guys will take over.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.160]  No, no, no.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.182]  The bad guys already took over.
[00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:12.091]  If your ideas are so good, they should be able to stand on their own.
[00:39:12.131 --> 00:39:33.380]  But see, your ideas can't stand on their own, so you surveil us through corporations, with the government, domestically, using intelligence agencies barred by law from operating domestically, to then censor us in live time to manipulate elections and to force poison experimental therapies on us with the poison shots and more.
[00:39:34.693 --> 00:39:45.002]  And these guys all got together with their big censorship system and their big control grid and decided they could make us eat piles of horse manure and tell us it was Dutch chocolate ice cream.
[00:39:45.723 --> 00:39:46.283]  Well, guess what?
[00:39:46.483 --> 00:39:48.765]  All your efforts failed and blew up in your face.
[00:39:50.967 --> 00:40:01.316]  And now, like dominoes, all these prominent Hollywood people and hedge fund heads and others are all the top rappers are all coming out, all the big cultural icons against you.
[00:40:04.687 --> 00:40:05.427]  And what's their answer?
[00:40:05.907 --> 00:40:08.168]  We'll just blow up a nuclear power plant and start World War III.
[00:40:08.768 --> 00:40:08.968]  Yeah.
[00:40:09.568 --> 00:40:10.928]  They're like, oh, you think you're going to stop us?
[00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:16.910]  And then Biden snorts a big old line of cocaine, and Obama gives them the order.
[00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:22.611]  Hope they got bunkers there in Martina's Vineyard.
[00:40:24.631 --> 00:40:28.072]  Very frightening, because these people are so incompetent and out of control.
[00:40:28.132 --> 00:40:30.152]  They inherited America's empire.
[00:40:30.352 --> 00:40:33.173]  They inherited our power, and they have crapped it down the drain.
[00:40:37.076 --> 00:40:48.442]  There's a big article about Obama and Big Mike on the giant 400-foot yacht of Tom Hanks on the Greek islands.
[00:40:49.887 --> 00:40:56.191]  Eating caviar, and they tweeted a bunch about how bad white people are, and how evil white people are, and how they've been oppressed because they're black.
[00:40:56.531 --> 00:41:04.316]  Yeah, the white people elected you, you're on a 400-foot yacht eating caviar, and you're sending out tweets bitching about the evil white people.
[00:41:04.376 --> 00:41:05.056]  Give me a break.
[00:41:05.357 --> 00:41:09.499]  Hey, if America's so bad, Obama, go live in Africa, buddy boy!
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.401]  But we know you're not from Kenya.
[00:41:12.901 --> 00:41:14.022]  We know that's not your dad.
[00:41:14.602 --> 00:41:15.623]  We know who your dad was.
[00:41:16.323 --> 00:41:18.445]  Very famous CIA officer.
[00:41:20.253 --> 00:41:22.575]  Who posed as the head of the Communist Party USA?
[00:41:24.796 --> 00:41:25.216]  Look it up.
[00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:26.177]  Frank Marshall Davis.
[00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:32.741]  Who ran Jeffrey Epstein type operations with sex operatives.
[00:41:33.041 --> 00:41:34.702]  It's all the same crew, folks.
[00:41:36.323 --> 00:41:37.124]  All the same people.
[00:41:40.306 --> 00:41:40.706]  Obama.
[00:41:40.906 --> 00:41:44.108]  I got five mansions and I'm on a 400 foot yacht.
[00:41:44.128 --> 00:41:45.889]  These white people been mean to me.
[00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:47.951]  Look at Big Mike.
[00:41:48.745 --> 00:41:57.584]   And the men that mean the big Mike So let's go ahead and start going to these clips
[00:41:57.593 --> 00:41:58.714]  Let's go ahead and play clip eight first.
[00:41:59.795 --> 00:42:01.616]  Through kind of the parameters of this injunction.
[00:42:01.796 --> 00:42:07.221]  Yeah, I mean, so it basically has some limits on what exactly the FBI, I think, most essentially is able to do.
[00:42:07.301 --> 00:42:12.306]  And I think that, you know, you have to take a step back and acknowledge what the reality is about how the FBI has been interacting with this.
[00:42:12.346 --> 00:42:15.008]  And just look at January 6th itself, for example, right?
[00:42:15.228 --> 00:42:19.671]  It's not as though the FBI has been going in and saying, hey, take down this post, hey, take down this post.
[00:42:19.931 --> 00:42:23.113]  That's what they're alleging, but there's just not a lot of evidence to support that.
[00:42:23.393 --> 00:42:31.518]  And basically, we've had a situation where some politicians are making any contact between social media companies and the FBI or law enforcement seem problematic in some way.
[00:42:31.538 --> 00:42:35.180]  And if you look at the reality, it's like, the FBI is not very good at monitoring social media.
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.761]  Just look at what happened on January 6th.
[00:42:36.981 --> 00:42:38.282]  There are all of these warning signs.
[00:42:38.302 --> 00:42:39.283]  Okay, yeah, no, that's enough.
[00:42:40.043 --> 00:42:42.064]  The Feds were running the attack on January 6th.
[00:42:42.084 --> 00:42:42.904]  That's all come out.
[00:42:43.564 --> 00:42:45.084]  It's in all the emails and text messages.
[00:42:45.124 --> 00:42:47.405]  They took down over 50 million posts on Facebook alone.
[00:42:47.825 --> 00:42:50.286]  This guy is a complete and total liar.
[00:42:50.666 --> 00:42:51.206]  Let's go to clip 7.
[00:42:51.646 --> 00:43:00.709]  MSNBC's already arguing the Biden administration can still censor content that quote undermines our faith in US elections as there's a national security issue.
[00:43:00.969 --> 00:43:06.590]  So the State Department goes around the world certifying elections and under its own rules we have some of the worst in the world.
[00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:11.892]   You have a right whether you're right or not To question elections, but now they're like, no, no, no.
[00:43:14.372 --> 00:43:16.173]  Furthermore, Danny, they do make exceptions.
[00:43:16.193 --> 00:43:20.114]  The judge makes exceptions for national security and criminal activity.
[00:43:20.594 --> 00:43:23.814]  But isn't there a fine line when it comes to national security specifically?
[00:43:24.195 --> 00:43:26.135]  Especially when we're talking about elections here.
[00:43:26.215 --> 00:43:31.816]  The fact that election, you know, the full faith that the American public has in elections could be undermined.
[00:43:32.736 --> 00:43:34.657]  Couldn't that potentially be a national security threat?
[00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:53.885]  Of course, and really one of the core issues here is when and how often and to what degree can a government agency, and specifically the White House or maybe the Surgeon General or some other government agency, to what degree can they contact a private social media company and put some pressure on to advance their message?
[00:43:54.226 --> 00:44:00.852]  What if it is vaccinations, the importance of vaccinations, and to what degree can there be consequences?
[00:44:01.252 --> 00:44:02.473]  So they're just normalizing.
[00:44:02.893 --> 00:44:08.255]  Well, you know, we're allowed to take stuff down that says I'm going to Jenny's house in one hour to kill her.
[00:44:08.575 --> 00:44:09.375]  Well, yeah, that's the law.
[00:44:10.096 --> 00:44:15.878]  But oh, isn't it a little different if you undermine an election like a Hunter Biden laptop that was all real the FBI had taken down?
[00:44:17.725 --> 00:44:24.428]  But remember, almost no one watches these stooges, but they're important because they're the mouth of the globalists, and you know what they're thinking, you know what they're doing.
[00:44:24.708 --> 00:44:30.710]  No, what you did is illegal, you stole the election, even if there wasn't voting fraud, which there was massively, we know that.
[00:44:31.551 --> 00:44:33.111]  This is election meddling, what you did.
[00:44:33.151 --> 00:44:37.293]  This is what you claim the Russians did, with no evidence, but with the full force of the U.S.
[00:44:37.353 --> 00:44:39.594]  government, with the full force of big tech.
[00:44:39.614 --> 00:44:42.135]  Let's play a couple more of these clips back-to-back.
[00:44:43.985 --> 00:44:46.647]  But this judge was confirmed 98-0 by the Senate.
[00:44:46.967 --> 00:45:03.698]  Just reading the words in this injunction, a quote, massive effort by the defendants to suppress speech based on content, those are the judge's words, calling the present case, quote, arguably involves the most massive attack against free speech in the United States history, Eli.
[00:45:03.718 --> 00:45:03.798]  Yeah.
[00:45:04.438 --> 00:45:07.581]  It's a dramatic decision by this judge, if you read through it.
[00:45:07.641 --> 00:45:11.084]  He's citing to literature and George Washington and Ben Franklin.
[00:45:11.285 --> 00:45:13.206]  Here's what really is astonishing to me.
[00:45:13.987 --> 00:45:18.351]  This is a conservative ideology that clearly comes through in this.
[00:45:19.392 --> 00:45:19.752]  Decision.
[00:45:19.812 --> 00:45:21.753]  It's a conservative political ideology, right?
[00:45:21.793 --> 00:45:26.374]  We saw some of the quotes, questioning vaccines, questioning masks, conservative talking points.
[00:45:26.634 --> 00:45:30.154]  But the ruling itself is the opposite of judicial conservatism.
[00:45:30.174 --> 00:45:33.395]  This is one of the most aggressive, far-reaching rulings you'll ever see.
[00:45:33.455 --> 00:45:45.278]  What this judge is purporting to do is to micromanage, really, the day-to-day interactions between essentially the entire executive branch, all these agencies that are listed as defendants, and the leading social media companies.
[00:45:45.578 --> 00:46:00.728]  In the actual temporary injunction, the judge basically says, you're not allowed, administration, to talk to these social media companies about any protected free speech except for cyber security threats, national security threats, criminal threats.
[00:46:01.008 --> 00:46:01.989]  But where's the line?
[00:46:02.129 --> 00:46:03.390]  Who's going to police this?
[00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:06.772]  I think Judge Daugherty's decision goes too far.
[00:46:06.872 --> 00:46:12.315]  We're in the press, we're always used to people from the government saying, hey, don't print that.
[00:46:12.695 --> 00:46:21.540]  But what the Twitter file showed, and in my book I talk about the night after night when they're releasing these files, is that it went a bit far.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:33.990]  It wasn't just government saying don't print things or amplify things about, say, the Barrington Doctrine, which talks about the spread of COVID.
[00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:36.812]  It was somehow coercing a bit.
[00:46:36.912 --> 00:46:46.276]   And what was worse The social media companies didn't just play along, they colluded and tried to stop some of the flow of information.
[00:46:46.637 --> 00:47:01.223]  So I think this is a little bit of a corrective but I clearly feel that in the end the decision will be refined somewhat because government has to have the right to have its own free speech to push back when they see things on social media that they think are dangerous.
[00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:10.140]  Yeah, and the government would argue we were just colluding, if you want to put it that way, to stop bad information from getting in the hands of people and threatening their well-being.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.862]  CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin.
[00:47:11.902 --> 00:47:12.683]  Andrew, thanks so much.
[00:47:12.724 --> 00:47:13.424]  We appreciate it.
[00:47:14.719 --> 00:47:16.361]  A lot of BS to unpack there.
[00:47:16.381 --> 00:47:17.181]  A lot of spin.
[00:47:17.802 --> 00:47:21.826]  But you hear the recurring thing, well, calls for violence, cyber security, crime.
[00:47:22.626 --> 00:47:23.808]  We've got to be able to do something.
[00:47:23.828 --> 00:47:24.548]  That's all there.
[00:47:24.889 --> 00:47:26.450]  The judge is following the law.
[00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.910]  What?
[00:47:27.291 --> 00:47:31.054]  The federal government with big tech done is illegal on so many fronts.
[00:47:31.695 --> 00:47:32.576]  It's so dangerous.
[00:47:33.096 --> 00:47:34.758]  The government has a right to have PR people.
[00:47:34.798 --> 00:47:39.002]  The government agencies and groups have a right to go and say what they want on their Twitter accounts.
[00:47:39.562 --> 00:47:50.706]  But you don't have a right to surveil everybody with NSA tools and then go in and read their private messages and harass them and take their bank accounts away and get them deleted off social media and lie about them.
[00:47:51.906 --> 00:48:07.152]  And that's why I was chosen, the PR firm that does the UN's PR, after they rigged those cases against me, came out and bragged, hey we ran this whole thing, we took stuff he said out of context, blew it up giant and massive, said he was currently doing things he never did.
[00:48:08.215 --> 00:48:15.258]  And then had judges default him, and had juries say he was guilty, and now we're going to use that precedent on everybody else.
[00:48:16.298 --> 00:48:18.639]  By just defaulting the Proud Boys, who were in jail.
[00:48:20.419 --> 00:48:31.764]  For tearing down a little Black Lives Matter banner, and burning it reportedly, the entire group was convicted by a judge in default, and told to pay a million dollars for a paper sign.
[00:48:33.884 --> 00:48:35.405]  Why did News Corp settle?
[00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:39.751]  In Delaware, a few months ago in the Tucker whole thing.
[00:48:39.771 --> 00:48:43.113]  And Tucker didn't even do anything in that case, but they drug him into it.
[00:48:44.293 --> 00:48:48.335]  Tucker said he didn't think there was fraud in that way there, electronically and stuff.
[00:48:48.995 --> 00:48:51.416]  He said it was in the media manipulation was how the fraud happened.
[00:48:51.436 --> 00:48:51.856]  He was right.
[00:48:53.297 --> 00:49:00.082]   But in that big Dominion case, the judge Did a default.
[00:49:00.262 --> 00:49:09.888]  Not an official default, but said, I find you lied about Dominion, and I find you hurt them, and I'm gonna tell the jury that they now need to decide the damages.
[00:49:09.908 --> 00:49:11.889]  So that's a default by any other name.
[00:49:12.409 --> 00:49:13.450]  It's still a default.
[00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:15.931]  A rose by any other name is still a rose.
[00:49:17.725 --> 00:49:18.485]  William Shakespeare.
[00:49:19.046 --> 00:49:22.487]  And so that's what they do now, and they're doing it all the time, everywhere.
[00:49:23.168 --> 00:49:25.649]  You're in a leftist jurisdiction, you get sued.
[00:49:25.869 --> 00:49:27.410]  These are George Soros judges, folks.
[00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:30.692]  It's not just George Soros prosecutors, or DAs.
[00:49:32.052 --> 00:49:33.273]  It's George Soros judges.
[00:49:33.913 --> 00:49:40.296]  And they literally laugh at you, and then let total fraud be put on against you, and you cannot respond.
[00:49:41.217 --> 00:49:47.386]   In Texas, Judge Guerra Gamble On the bench two years, funded by the left and Soros PACs.
[00:49:49.167 --> 00:50:01.331]  She called me a liar, called me a fraud with no evidence, told the jury I was a fraud and a liar, and then let a guy get up there and say I'm worth $400 million with no proof, never saw her books, just made up, so they thought I had all this money.
[00:50:02.411 --> 00:50:05.393]  And the jury said, well, we don't want to take all this money, we only gave them 10% of his money.
[00:50:06.113 --> 00:50:08.514]  I didn't have $45 million, I didn't have $3 million.
[00:50:09.634 --> 00:50:11.315]  But they lied, and she knew they were lying.
[00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:13.375]  She's a criminal.
[00:50:13.375 --> 00:50:26.375]  [Music]
[00:50:26.375 --> 00:50:33.375]   We just ended three plus years of UN worldwide lockdowns and restrictions and forced injections.
[00:50:34.132 --> 00:50:40.500]  Russia and Ukraine have been battling in a NATO-Russia proxy war for the last year and a half.
[00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:45.606]  Islamists are burning down large parts of cities across Europe.
[00:50:46.227 --> 00:50:46.607]  The U.S.
[00:50:46.688 --> 00:50:48.329]  border has completely collapsed.
[00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:52.232]  Millions and millions are coming across here, many of them kidnapped children.
[00:50:52.893 --> 00:50:55.034]  Fentanyl deaths are over 100,000 a year.
[00:50:55.755 --> 00:50:57.897]  GMO products are being forced on the public.
[00:50:58.137 --> 00:51:02.140]  5G is being erected in every major industrialized country.
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.822]  Cancer rates are exploding.
[00:51:04.142 --> 00:51:07.324]  Heart attacks, strokes, neurological disorders.
[00:51:07.445 --> 00:51:09.686]  Now 25-year-olds are, quote, getting Alzheimer's.
[00:51:10.767 --> 00:51:15.771]  With all that's going on in the world, I couldn't think of a better person to interview than David Icke.
[00:51:16.131 --> 00:51:19.073]  He joins us in six minutes for the next two hours.
[00:51:18.952 --> 00:51:23.552]   the star of the new world order. The transgender cult's chopping the penises and breasts off
[00:51:23.552 --> 00:51:28.311]  of millions of children. But we're fighting it at Infowars.com.
[00:51:28.311 --> 00:51:31.552]   With all that's going on in the world, I couldn't think of a better person to interview than
[00:51:31.552 --> 00:51:38.072]   David Icke. He joins us in six minutes for the next two hours. Very honored to have him.
[00:51:38.072 --> 00:51:39.192]  We have certainly been vindicated that he's a great man.
[00:51:39.206 --> 00:51:40.748]  The New World Order is now out in the open.
[00:51:41.129 --> 00:51:42.791]  Here's a key report on the U.S.
[00:51:42.611 --> 00:52:01.891]   US government launching the first phases of the central bank digital currencies.
[00:52:01.846 --> 00:52:09.555]  He came to this conclusion based on current events that haven't happened since the 1930s, the largest amounts of debt and inflation.
[00:52:10.015 --> 00:52:17.681]  The biggest gaps in wealth and values, resulting in the rise of populism on both the left and the right against the elites.
[00:52:18.262 --> 00:52:21.705]  And the greatest international conflict between world powers.
[00:52:22.245 --> 00:52:25.127]  Most importantly, between the US and China.
[00:52:25.708 --> 00:52:38.997]   Peter Ange writes that the easy way out of this mess would be for the elite to proactively shrink in scope, get government out of the economy, out of social engineering, and out of propagandizing kids.
[00:52:39.677 --> 00:52:41.478]  But of course, this won't happen.
[00:52:41.998 --> 00:52:51.204]  Common sense and simple observation will tell you that the so-called elites will continue on their path towards economic destruction and world war.
[00:52:51.744 --> 00:52:55.346]  Which is likely what the international bankers had planned all along.
[00:52:55.926 --> 00:53:05.410]  Let us not forget that the fast-growing BRICS monetary system was born in 2001 out of Goldman Sachs.
[00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:15.133]  In 1971, President Nixon officially ended the gold standard and replaced it with the petrodollar, in which OPEC agreed to price their oil in U.S.
[00:53:15.193 --> 00:53:17.594]  dollars in exchange for U.S.
[00:53:17.654 --> 00:53:18.715]  military protection.
[00:53:19.455 --> 00:53:24.242]  This blood money deal preserved US control over the world economy.
[00:53:24.742 --> 00:53:32.853]  But when the US weaponized the swift payment system against Russia, BRICS became the only viable solution for the rest of the world.
[00:53:33.714 --> 00:53:40.641]   Reuters in New Delhi Reported that last May, the State Bank of India rejected Indian Oil Corp.'
[00:53:40.621 --> 00:53:42.342]  's planned payment in U.S.
[00:53:42.362 --> 00:53:43.803]  dollars for Russian oil.
[00:53:44.264 --> 00:53:52.791]  And so they went to a private bank and settled their trade for Russian oil by paying in Yuan to the Bank of China, and have continued to do so since.
[00:53:53.552 --> 00:53:54.452]  A shortage of U.S.
[00:53:54.493 --> 00:54:02.900]  dollars in Argentina has caused commercial banks to allow the Chinese Yuan as a form of currency in savings and checkings accounts.
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:14.707]  Argentina has already been issuing securities in the Chinese Yuan and has made a $2.7 billion payment to the International Monetary Fund using the Chinese BRICS currency.
[00:54:15.487 --> 00:54:20.250]  The Federal Reserve Bank's FedNow is scheduled for launch by the end of July.
[00:54:20.731 --> 00:54:25.974]  FedNow is officially an update to the Federal Reserve's payment processing and settlement system.
[00:54:26.394 --> 00:54:30.575]  And appears to be a backdoor to creating a central bank digital currency.
[00:54:31.116 --> 00:54:39.739]  Private blockchain operator Tassat has partnered with the Federal Reserve's new payment system and will serve as an interface for FedNow.
[00:54:40.479 --> 00:54:52.583]  FedNow will also connect with Metal Blockchain, whose CEO and founder claims will allow banks to prepare for an eventual central bank digital currency, along with bank-issued stablecoins.
[00:54:53.463 --> 00:54:59.845]  The idea of a central bank digital currency is already hugely unpopular with the majority of Americans.
[00:55:00.425 --> 00:55:07.808]  But according to Dale Hauser, it is being set up to destroy alternative blockchain solutions, such as Ripple and Stellar.
[00:55:08.328 --> 00:55:17.291]  And if the powers that be are successful in destroying the US economy, then the only other option to accepting a CBDC would be some sort of revolution.
[00:55:17.791 --> 00:55:23.797]  Which would be nearly impossible, seeing as how divided the populist movement is within the left-right paradigm.
[00:55:24.798 --> 00:55:37.251]  Last week in China, the World Economic Forum proclaimed that the entire world needs to switch to a central bank digital currency, with expiry dates and restrictions on undesirable purchases.
[00:55:37.851 --> 00:55:53.862]  They proposed using artificial intelligence to censor hate speech and disinformation on the internet, and using artificial intelligence to control a global social credit system that will involve wearable devices with sensors to monitor everyone's actions.
[00:55:54.902 --> 00:56:04.850]  If we, the people, fail to unite against the powers that be, then their solution will most certainly be world war, depopulation, and total control.
[00:56:05.491 --> 00:56:07.472]  And this is all happening right now.
[00:56:08.273 --> 00:56:10.555]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:56:11.996 --> 00:56:16.699]  Ladies and gentlemen, David Icke is live with us in 60 seconds.
[00:56:16.739 --> 00:56:19.642]  Could not have a more important guest at a more important time.
[00:56:19.702 --> 00:56:20.622]  DavidIcke.com.
[00:56:20.642 --> 00:56:21.083]  Stay with us.
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:33.880]  Well, if anybody in the world has been completely vindicated in his work the last 35 years, it's David Icke.
[00:56:35.285 --> 00:56:37.766]  And of course myself and a few others are close seconds.
[00:56:38.647 --> 00:56:40.107]  And I wish we hadn't been vindicated.
[00:56:40.127 --> 00:56:42.668]  I wish that our understanding of the world had been wrong.
[00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:45.350]  But now it's all out in the open.
[00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:47.671]  Planetary world government that wants to depopulate us.
[00:56:48.311 --> 00:56:49.631]  Cashless societies.
[00:56:50.212 --> 00:56:54.053]  Takeovers of our bodies with nanotech and electromagnetic radiation.
[00:56:55.074 --> 00:56:56.315]  Open Satanism.
[00:56:56.335 --> 00:56:58.876]  I was just in Omaha.
[00:57:00.157 --> 00:57:00.837]  I mean, this is just so crazy.
[00:57:00.658 --> 00:57:04.537]   I see my wife's father was in the hospital, he had a gay pride parade come by the hotel.
[00:57:04.537 --> 00:57:09.177]   They were wearing Satan shirts, I got photos of it, showed you, saying, "We're gonna get
[00:57:09.177 --> 00:57:10.177]  your children."
[00:57:10.177 --> 00:57:14.138]  I mean, this is just so crazy.
[00:57:14.138 --> 00:57:18.978]   The Ukrainian dictator says that the Russians are gonna blow up a nuclear power plant this
[00:57:18.978 --> 00:57:20.818]  week.
[00:57:20.818 --> 00:57:23.177]  It just goes on and on and on.
[00:57:23.183 --> 00:57:28.864]  We have the new king coronated with his calls for world government and depopulation.
[00:57:29.504 --> 00:57:40.726]  Then we've got this viral videos of the woman on a Dallas plane, out of Dallas last night, yesterday, who reportedly saw a man in a green hoodie turn into some type of reptile.
[00:57:41.546 --> 00:57:42.727]  And I wouldn't normally go with this.
[00:57:42.747 --> 00:57:45.967]  She doesn't look schizophrenic, doesn't sound nuts, sounds generally freaked out.
[00:57:46.327 --> 00:57:48.908]  But some of the other people on board said they saw things.
[00:57:50.182 --> 00:57:57.715]  The reason I'm going to raise this is David Icke talked about this 30 plus years ago, and I never made fun of him about it because a lot of what he said was credible.
[00:57:58.336 --> 00:58:03.384]  I couldn't prove it, but I talked about this a few months ago, so he can cover this now or later in the next two hours.
[00:58:04.302 --> 00:58:08.302]   He can cover any of the issues I'm throwing or anything he wants to get to first.
[00:58:08.302 --> 00:58:16.422]   But I have met with a lot of really prominent people, household names recently, really in the last year,
[00:58:16.422 --> 00:58:20.061]  and they all keep telling me about the same experiences.
[00:58:20.061 --> 00:58:28.062]   And I didn't talk about it until five prominent people had basically told me the same stories in the last year.
[00:58:28.062 --> 00:58:34.202]   And so I started telling you about this, and I only had one event happen like this to me
[00:58:34.202 --> 00:58:39.442]   when I was a teenager, I was not on drugs, and I'd been taken to jail for fighting.
[00:58:39.572 --> 00:58:45.578]  And some of the police officers took me in the back room, and just for two seconds, one of their faces, he said, oh, you think you're a tough kid?
[00:58:45.958 --> 00:58:48.080]  And literally, his face changed right in front of me.
[00:58:48.701 --> 00:58:51.043]  And on my children, it happened, I saw it.
[00:58:51.663 --> 00:58:53.205]  So something's going on.
[00:58:53.345 --> 00:58:53.825]  What is this?
[00:58:53.885 --> 00:58:55.527]  And why is it getting more prevalent?
[00:58:55.907 --> 00:58:59.050]  Because if I told you the names, these are very serious people.
[00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:00.531]  Most of them weren't even religious.
[00:59:01.252 --> 00:59:04.313]  And when they saw this, they got religion very, very quickly.
[00:59:04.353 --> 00:59:07.413]  And then why is it happening to prominent people, what's going on?
[00:59:07.473 --> 00:59:13.354]  So it seems like the veil between other dimensions and things is fading or something's happening.
[00:59:14.414 --> 00:59:15.875]  So many things to talk about.
[00:59:15.915 --> 00:59:22.096]  But remember, when we go into this esoteric or occult or unknown area, that just means stuff that's not been discovered yet.
[00:59:22.736 --> 00:59:24.516]  They're always finding new species every day.
[00:59:24.556 --> 00:59:27.357]  They're always discovering new energy sources, new elements.
[00:59:27.897 --> 00:59:34.170]   We've only discovered A few square feet of the territory around us compared to an entire universe.
[00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:36.892]  So, David, that's my intro here.
[00:59:37.353 --> 00:59:41.056]  You can start with these phenomenon or you can end with a phenomenon.
[00:59:41.396 --> 00:59:43.018]  You can go wherever you'd like, but thank you.
[00:59:43.078 --> 00:59:44.659]  Because we were trying to set you up for weeks.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.000]  Perfect timing.
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:51.065]  You came on today with the hysteria off of what this woman and others saw on this plane.
[00:59:52.853 --> 00:59:57.216]  Yeah, well, I'd like to start deep in the rabbit hole, Alex, if you don't mind.
[00:59:58.437 --> 01:00:08.303]  I've just finished a book that's coming out on September the 1st called The Dream, which goes deeper in the rabbit hole than I've ever been.
[01:00:08.643 --> 01:00:13.807]  And there's information in that book that simply has never been written or revealed before.
[01:00:14.587 --> 01:00:18.310]  And it puts into context what is actually happening.
[01:00:18.968 --> 01:00:31.831]  You know, I've been saying all these decades that we cannot understand what is happening in the world of the seen unless we understand what's happening in the world of the unseen.
[01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:40.553]  So very quickly, you know, for people who haven't come across this, and you should ask why haven't they come across this?
[01:00:40.653 --> 01:00:43.534]  Why isn't this taught in the schools as a matter of course?
[01:00:44.338 --> 01:00:50.400]  But what we see is only a tiny band of frequency, so small it's ridiculous.
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:01:01.943]  Everything beyond that frequency band, the limits of what the five senses can decode and the eye senses can decode into a visual reality, is infinity.
[01:01:02.683 --> 01:01:21.001]   And if you think of radio stations in the old analog system and television stations, they shared the same space, they share the same space, Um, but they don't interfere with each other, impact upon each other, unless they're really close on the dial.
[01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:45.675]   So if you want to look for outside of this reality dimension, whatever you want to call it, for that level that can interfere with this, Then you've got to look at bands of dimensional frequency that are very close to this one but just outside of our five sense reality and our ability to perceive it in the natural course of events.
[01:01:46.556 --> 01:01:54.242]  And I'll call this dimension that's close to this one the astral or the fourth dimension.
[01:01:55.002 --> 01:01:57.104]  Call this 3D, the third dimension.
[01:01:57.984 --> 01:02:08.407]  And in the lower levels of this astral dimension, in other words the lower frequency levels which are really close to this one, that's the realm of the demonic.
[01:02:09.047 --> 01:02:19.990]  That's where demons and their name and description in all different religions and cultures, that's where they exist.
[01:02:20.834 --> 01:02:27.937]  These are the entities that the Satanists are interacting with in their rituals.
[01:02:28.417 --> 01:02:38.000]  Why do these Satanists, who may be sick, but a lot of them are not stupid, why are they doing these rituals?
[01:02:38.079 --> 01:02:42.319]  because they're interacting with these entities.
[01:02:42.319 --> 01:02:49.358]   And when you do rituals as they do in the same places over and over and over again,
[01:02:49.358 --> 01:02:59.119]   what it does is it thins out the frequency difference between the astral, lower astral where these demons are,
[01:02:59.119 --> 01:03:00.199]  and this reality.
[01:03:00.199 --> 01:03:03.679]  And so that interaction is made possible.
[01:03:03.679 --> 01:03:14.719]   Now, what's happening now is that that lower astral dimension is starting to fuse into ours.
[01:03:14.714 --> 01:03:22.821]  And these demonic entities are much more able to move into our reality and stay for longer.
[01:03:23.581 --> 01:03:41.467]   And one of the conduits, hello, that is allowing this to happen, that is the connection frequency that allows this to happen more now than ever before is what we call 5G, with 6G and 7G to come.
[01:03:41.967 --> 01:03:52.092]  This 5G, there's so many elements to it, and one of them is that it is acting as a frequency conduit for these demonic entities to come into this realm.
[01:03:52.492 --> 01:03:55.333]  So people will start to see them.
[01:03:55.733 --> 01:04:03.497]  And what they do is they, quote, possess bodies, and there's also hybrids, which are part demonic and part human.
[01:04:04.815 --> 01:04:17.525]  And as this goes on, people are seeing more and more of this demonic level, and thus they're saying, oh my God, he turned into a reptile, he turned into this, he turned into the other.
[01:04:17.865 --> 01:04:20.307]  And we're going to see more and more and more of this.
[01:04:20.868 --> 01:04:33.998]  And it's to understand, in the end, that you can talk about Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum, and we should, and your Gateses and your Fouches and all these people, and your Soruses, quite right.
[01:04:35.276 --> 01:04:37.378]  But they are gophers.
[01:04:38.359 --> 01:04:41.762]  They are vehicles for this demonic realm.
[01:04:41.862 --> 01:04:43.783]  That's why they have no empathy.
[01:04:43.823 --> 01:04:47.206]  That's why they have no, what we would call, soul.
[01:04:47.546 --> 01:04:49.048]  That's why they do what they do.
[01:04:49.068 --> 01:04:51.190]  You're saying they're biological robots?
[01:04:53.211 --> 01:04:59.717]  Well, this is an area of my book, The Dream, and indeed The Trap, the one that's out at the moment.
[01:05:00.568 --> 01:05:06.192]  Which I emphasize to quite a large extent.
[01:05:06.912 --> 01:05:11.536]  This is how I see it, Alex, okay, after 35 years of researching this.
[01:05:12.536 --> 01:05:20.101]  The body is a biological computer, I've been saying that for decades, and it's a program, it's a software program.
[01:05:20.762 --> 01:05:44.977]   So, if you do not introduce consciousness beyond the program, Then that AI software program, which is what the biological is, and I should make this emphasis, people look at biological and they think that's natural.
[01:05:46.097 --> 01:05:51.259]  To this demonic realm, the biological is a form of the technological.
[01:05:51.939 --> 01:05:59.857]   It's just that Because we see technology with steel and machines and circuits, we think that's technology.
[01:06:00.297 --> 01:06:07.218]  And we think what is apparently natural is natural, biologically natural.
[01:06:07.478 --> 01:06:10.039]  But actually, to them, it's a form of technology.
[01:06:10.059 --> 01:06:11.119]  It's a form of software.
[01:06:11.499 --> 01:06:17.180]  So when you're getting these... And notice the electrochemical is interfacing with the silicon.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.860]  They actually work together very similarly.
[01:06:21.101 --> 01:06:21.501]  Well, you...
[01:06:23.311 --> 01:06:35.194]  We'll have seen the documents from Moderna, for instance, where they describe when they're talking about this fake vaccine, they're talking about it being an operating system.
[01:06:35.774 --> 01:06:38.595]  See, as humans talk about, well, this is natural.
[01:06:38.615 --> 01:06:40.435]  Well, how do we know it's natural?
[01:06:40.495 --> 01:06:43.116]  What have we got it to compare it with?
[01:06:44.156 --> 01:06:44.556]  Nothing.
[01:06:44.976 --> 01:07:00.647]   You know, if you have a headset on in a virtual reality game, Then you can thrash about because your mind thinks it's real, but you can take the headset off and you go, whoa, it was just a game.
[01:07:01.848 --> 01:07:11.651]   But if the body brain system is the equivalent of the headset for humans, And you can't take it off.
[01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:17.636]  And therefore, everything that you look at, which you think is natural, well, how do we know?
[01:07:17.656 --> 01:07:23.560]  And you've been saying this for 35 years, and now Avatar and everything else has picked up what you say.
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:26.883]  And then now the new Avatars are killing whales for their adrenochrome.
[01:07:27.503 --> 01:07:28.524]  Same thing over and over again.
[01:07:28.584 --> 01:07:33.046]  And so my listeners know this, they understand it, can't wait to read the new book, go next level with that.
[01:07:33.286 --> 01:07:40.289]  But I promise listeners, and my wife and others want to ask you questions, to just go through the waterfront of what we're currently seeing.
[01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:42.630]  I understand getting the big picture is important.
[01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:45.851]  I want to spend the rest of this segment, another 10 minutes on this topic.
[01:07:46.352 --> 01:07:50.694]  But I should probably talk to you off the air at some point, because this is really in confidence.
[01:07:51.514 --> 01:08:15.609]  But very prominent household names, and it's happening to a lot of regular people too, but it tends to be really happening to prominent people who didn't believe in God, but weren't occultists, weren't Satanists, where they are seeing what this woman saw, but being attacked by it in their rooms at night, driving along in their car alone, the literal, like the original Twilight Zone with the gremlin on the wing of the plane.
[01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:22.413]  Stuff like this is happening to household names, and they're calling me saying, oh my God, I guess God's real, or this is something else.
[01:08:23.134 --> 01:08:24.294]  So, is it?
[01:08:24.314 --> 01:08:33.280]  I think what you're saying is the 5G and all of this is breaking down the dimensions, and it's like a conduit to have this electricity jump into ours?
[01:08:34.501 --> 01:08:40.125]  Yeah, it's acting as a bridge, a frequency bridge, absolutely designed to do that.
[01:08:40.817 --> 01:08:46.562]  And I think there's someone who's firing that at the Earth, isn't there, from Low Orbit Satellites?
[01:08:46.602 --> 01:08:47.122]  What's his name?
[01:08:47.282 --> 01:08:48.263]  Elon Musk.
[01:08:48.283 --> 01:08:50.124]  Elon Musk, that's it.
[01:08:50.144 --> 01:08:53.527]  Yeah, so I have a few questions about him.
[01:08:54.108 --> 01:08:56.209]  You would understand, given that.
[01:08:56.449 --> 01:09:03.435]  Spend all the time you want on Musk, but so quantifying it, you're getting the same intel that this is intensifying.
[01:09:04.454 --> 01:09:11.040]  Yeah, if I could just take this further with the body program, the software program.
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.003]  It's a behavior program, it's a perception program.
[01:09:14.463 --> 01:09:25.513]  So if you come out of the womb without consciousness, the eternal part of us, intervening, then that program will run your life.
[01:09:26.213 --> 01:09:32.199]  It will decide what you think and from what you think it will decide what you behave, how you behave.
[01:09:33.985 --> 01:09:35.867]  It's like a computer.
[01:09:36.428 --> 01:09:39.331]  It's like a computer without an operator.
[01:09:39.351 --> 01:09:42.254]  It's like a computer, if you like, going rogue with a virus.
[01:09:42.274 --> 01:09:44.376]  So, you know, you're tapping the keys and...
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:47.261]  Whacking the mouse, but it's not responding.
[01:09:47.721 --> 01:10:01.506]  But consciousness, this is why they want to suppress consciousness, the true self, the eternal self, which is a field of energy awareness that can intervene in the program.
[01:10:01.886 --> 01:10:24.113]   And the difference between what you might call non-player characters who just go through life nodding, yes sir, no sir, whatever you say, COVID, yeah, yeah, I'll believe everything you say, And maverick people that are saying, hold on a minute, I'm seeing this in a much bigger arena here, a much bigger panorama, and this doesn't make sense to me.
[01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:31.135]  And by the way, I'm not going to cooperate with the people that want to control me, because I can see they want to control me.
[01:10:31.475 --> 01:10:32.855]  That's consciousness.
[01:10:33.315 --> 01:10:52.380]   And this is the difference between conscious people Okay, and I want you to go wherever you want, because look, I obviously know Elon Musk is doing the brain interface and the 5G and all of it.
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:53.641]  I don't trust him as far as I can throw him.
[01:10:53.961 --> 01:10:55.121]  I'm still banned on Twitter.
[01:10:56.021 --> 01:10:58.942]  But at the same time, I see him saying, go outside.
[01:11:00.002 --> 01:11:03.843]  You know, I see him coming out against censorship, all these things.
[01:11:04.464 --> 01:11:14.627]   And I also see All these prominent people from Ice Cube to Ice-T to Russell Brand to you name it, sounding just like David Icke and Alex Jones.
[01:11:15.067 --> 01:11:19.828]  Is that them riding the awakening that they witness happening or are they part of the awakening?
[01:11:20.449 --> 01:11:25.430]  And maybe the best test case, I respect your view, is then who do you think Elon Musk really is?
[01:11:26.410 --> 01:11:28.031]  Well, Alex, they're not.
[01:11:28.857 --> 01:11:31.058]  They're not David Icke and Alex Jones.
[01:11:31.598 --> 01:11:34.500]  They're a incredibly mild version of it.
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:48.547]  And one of my great concerns is that the alternative media is being pushed closer to the mainstream in significant areas.
[01:11:48.987 --> 01:11:55.611]  Because, you know, after COVID or with COVID, a lot of doctors came in, a lot of other people came in who were mainstream people.
[01:11:56.750 --> 01:12:00.636]  And that was great, to talk about the bait and jab and all that was great.
[01:12:01.177 --> 01:12:07.086]  But what they've also done, a lot of them, is bring the rest of their mainstream belief system with them.
[01:12:07.226 --> 01:12:09.149]  And look how we started off this chat.
[01:12:09.978 --> 01:12:18.562]  The cutting edge of this is way, way over the horizon from that, what I call the mainstream of the alternative.
[01:12:18.963 --> 01:12:26.447]  And you know, Russell Brand, he had me on his shows years and years and years ago to take the piss.
[01:12:27.287 --> 01:12:35.251]  You know, he had me on and he put pictures up with the audience on the TV saying, well, is he a reptile?
[01:12:35.331 --> 01:12:36.212]  Is he a reptile?
[01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:37.032]  Is he a reptile?
[01:12:37.472 --> 01:12:38.893]  He wasn't interested.
[01:12:39.759 --> 01:12:42.020]  In getting across what was actually happening.
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:47.341]  And then after COVID, another bandwagon arrived, and he jumped on it.
[01:12:48.361 --> 01:12:52.783]  And he then becomes, oh, Mr. Exposing What's Going On.
[01:12:53.383 --> 01:13:01.765]  What he's talking about, what these others are talking about, and I'm glad they are, was being exposed decades ago by some of us, you know.
[01:13:02.205 --> 01:13:24.300]   And it's very, very important that the alternative media is not barricaded in By hearing no further people who won't go into these deep areas where the real truth and cause of all this lies, what we're seeing in this world of the scene is the symptom, not the cause, we must keep pushing the cutting edge.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:29.304]  And so in terms of Elon Musk, here's my questions, Alex.
[01:13:30.185 --> 01:13:37.162]   First of all, he says that AI could be the end of humanity as we know it.
[01:13:37.382 --> 01:13:38.342]  Absolutely true.
[01:13:38.743 --> 01:13:44.665]  And then he starts a company called Neuralink to connect the human brain to computers and AI.
[01:13:45.525 --> 01:13:58.169]  He is putting up these low-orbit satellites through SpaceX which are fundamental, with others, to creating this cloud which I'm talking about.
[01:13:58.249 --> 01:14:04.798]   And the cloud is not just the bridge conduit between The Astral Dimension and this one.
[01:14:05.479 --> 01:14:21.102]  It's also the cloud to which we are meant to be connected, not least through the content of the Chab, to become a hive mind where everyone thinks the same, because it's coming from a central point.
[01:14:21.122 --> 01:14:28.583]  I mean, the last thing we should be doing is connecting technology or artificial intelligence to the human brain.
[01:14:28.704 --> 01:14:30.744]  What are you doing, Mr. Musk?
[01:14:31.678 --> 01:14:39.061]  And then he's got this Tesla, which is the climate change agenda.
[01:14:39.121 --> 01:14:48.984]  It's the whole basis of why Tesla exists, with the electric cars doing far more damage to the environment than ever petrol and diesel car does.
[01:14:49.365 --> 01:14:50.385]  And then I ask this.
[01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:55.865]  You know, people say to me, yeah, but he bought Twitter and he's a free speech absolutist.
[01:14:55.905 --> 01:14:58.728]  Well, he's not, but that's what he claims.
[01:14:59.348 --> 01:15:03.873]  Okay, and he put out the Twitter files, yeah, okay, and what did the Twitter files say?
[01:15:04.313 --> 01:15:08.117]  Well, they said the Deep State completely controlled Twitter.
[01:15:08.457 --> 01:15:08.838]  Yes!
[01:15:09.578 --> 01:15:09.899]  Right!
[01:15:10.919 --> 01:15:15.100]  The Deep State completely controlled Twitter, and what was said on it, and what wasn't.
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:19.141]  And Facebook, and Google, and Google owned YouTube.
[01:15:19.701 --> 01:15:20.641]  So, question.
[01:15:21.002 --> 01:15:28.984]  Why would the Deep State, and your Black Rocks, and your Vanguards, and your State Streets, complete cult operations?
[01:15:29.844 --> 01:15:40.424]   Why would they not only sell to Musk, Twitter, but also threaten to take him to court to Force him to buy it.
[01:15:40.564 --> 01:15:42.225]  And then there's this question I have.
[01:15:43.226 --> 01:15:43.926]  Who owns Twitter?
[01:15:43.966 --> 01:15:45.187]  Well, Elon Musk owns Twitter.
[01:15:45.287 --> 01:15:47.128]  Oh, well, just hold on a second.
[01:15:48.069 --> 01:15:51.171]  Twitter's been absorbed into something called X Corporation.
[01:15:52.072 --> 01:15:55.674]  And so Twitter basically doesn't exist except as a name, as a corporate entity.
[01:15:55.735 --> 01:15:56.675]  It's X Corporation.
[01:15:58.076 --> 01:15:58.857]  Or X Corp.
[01:15:59.357 --> 01:16:04.981]  But that has a parent company called X Holdings Corporation.
[01:16:05.461 --> 01:16:20.040]   Now, I don't know whether you came across this, but recently there was a court case In which a fired employee of Twitter took Twitter to court trying to get their just desserts.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:33.705]  And part of that was their lawyers asked Twitter to name the shareholders of X Holdings Corporation, which actually owns Twitter.
[01:16:34.939 --> 01:16:37.560]  And the judge said, yes, yes, we want to see it.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:38.760]  Produce the document.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:39.380]  So they did.
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:47.302]  And all 95 entities in ex Holdings Corporation were scored off.
[01:16:47.962 --> 01:16:48.542]  Couldn't see them.
[01:16:49.003 --> 01:16:58.855]   So then Twitter did a deal with the judge that they would reveal to the person's lawyer By the way, David, I'm familiar with this.
[01:16:59.155 --> 01:17:02.976]  What you're saying is totally true, and I totally agree with you.
[01:17:02.836 --> 01:17:04.836]  Who are the 95?
[01:17:04.836 --> 01:17:09.916]   We should know in a transparent situation that we are apparently dealing with a crime.
[01:17:09.916 --> 01:17:11.315]  By the way, David, I'm familiar with this.
[01:17:11.315 --> 01:17:13.996]   What you're saying is totally true, and I totally agree with you.
[01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:18.775]   If they know there's a huge awakening coming that they weren't able to stop, they wanna lead it.
[01:17:18.775 --> 01:17:23.155]   And so, whereas we continue to be suppressed, now there's all these new people
[01:17:23.155 --> 01:17:27.916]   that basically become watered-down versions of us, and I think people should be aware of that,
[01:17:27.916 --> 01:17:32.796]   but I do see it as a major victory that their brute force censorship didn't work
[01:17:32.796 --> 01:17:35.195]  So they're having to now try to lead the opposition.
[01:17:35.425 --> 01:17:37.205]  I do see this as a defeat for them.
[01:17:38.246 --> 01:17:46.748]  Yeah, well, you see, they saw the potential, big time, of the alternative media.
[01:17:47.492 --> 01:17:49.154]  At the time the COVID card was played.
[01:17:50.075 --> 01:17:56.421]  And of course they reacted to that with mass censorship, ludicrous censorship, and it's still going on and it's still expanding.
[01:17:57.023 --> 01:18:00.206]  But they know they can't shut down everything.
[01:18:00.706 --> 01:18:01.847]  And was it Lenin?
[01:18:01.887 --> 01:18:08.332]  It was Lenin who said, worse to the effect of, how do you control the opposition?
[01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:09.313]  You run it yourself.
[01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:10.954]  They were worse to the effect that he said.
[01:18:11.415 --> 01:18:23.585]  And so we've got to be very, very careful about this and not let people come in and not just take it over, but then limit the range to which it will go.
[01:18:24.825 --> 01:18:33.989]  David, I totally agree with you.
[01:18:34.389 --> 01:18:36.549]  It's not to say we're the original gangsters or something.
[01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:38.030]  We're not territorializing this.
[01:18:38.050 --> 01:18:44.092]  We want an awakening, and it is happening, but they're launching all of this to try to lead the folks that are awakening right now.
[01:18:44.132 --> 01:18:47.673]  We'll talk about what comes next and where you see this fight going.
[01:18:47.993 --> 01:18:49.134]  David Ikes, our guest, stay with us.

[01:20:45.339 --> 01:20:49.943]  Now David, I've known who you are for 30 plus years, probably 32 years, 33 years.
[01:20:52.006 --> 01:20:54.907]  I've been interviewing you for at least 26, 27 years.
[01:20:54.947 --> 01:20:56.307]  I've been on there 29.
[01:20:56.967 --> 01:21:03.309]  And I remember you coming on my show, and I've tried to find the interview, but they took it all off YouTube.
[01:21:04.469 --> 01:21:05.750]  But it had to be 20 years ago.
[01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:13.912]  And saying, doing my research and really focusing into the higher dimensions.
[01:21:15.473 --> 01:21:17.675]  I believe there'll be a Great Awakening by 2016.
[01:21:17.955 --> 01:21:20.798]  There'll be a big pushback into the middle of the 2025.
[01:21:20.898 --> 01:21:24.140]  And I think this will all be decided by 2030.
[01:21:24.821 --> 01:21:27.403]  And I'm listening to this saying, okay, we'll see if that happens.
[01:21:27.904 --> 01:21:29.325]  It all happened basically as you said.
[01:21:29.345 --> 01:21:32.547]  And now no one can deny the Great Awakening is here.
[01:21:33.348 --> 01:21:43.159]  But at the same time, the evil, the dark forces are intensifying and are really on the march.
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:46.523]  So how would you describe this if it was a soccer game?
[01:21:49.787 --> 01:21:53.929]  Top goalie yourself before you became a broadcaster with the BBC.
[01:21:54.569 --> 01:22:01.152]  If this was a British style football game, how would you describe where we are and what's happening?
[01:22:01.612 --> 01:22:02.752]  Are the bad guys winning?
[01:22:03.373 --> 01:22:04.293]  Are the good guys winning?
[01:22:04.353 --> 01:22:05.313]  Are we at a stalemate?
[01:22:08.075 --> 01:22:11.336]  Well, the game isn't over yet.
[01:22:12.006 --> 01:22:12.686]  That's the point.
[01:22:13.367 --> 01:22:26.412]  And, uh, where we are now, um, as you will know, I mean, when I started out, uh, in 1990, on this road that I'm still on, um, no one wanted to know.
[01:22:26.432 --> 01:22:37.437]  You talked about this stuff, reptiles, you're mad, and all this stuff, and, uh, oh no, people running the world, that's impossible, a few people can't run the world, they couldn't do it.
[01:22:38.117 --> 01:22:40.798]  All that was completely dismissed.
[01:22:41.471 --> 01:22:42.712]  But look at it now.
[01:22:43.452 --> 01:22:44.273]  Look at it now.
[01:22:44.413 --> 01:22:53.578]  I mean, it's a phenomenal number of people now, not least since COVID, that have started to see that the world's not like they thought it was.
[01:22:53.638 --> 01:23:00.622]  They're starting to see how the dots connect and how the same thing is happening everywhere.
[01:23:00.682 --> 01:23:02.883]  How does that happen without coordination?
[01:23:03.544 --> 01:23:16.594]   So, you know, the people that are kind of relatively new to this, they will look at the situation and go, We're in real trouble because no one's waking up.
[01:23:16.674 --> 01:23:17.975]  Not enough people are waking up.
[01:23:18.795 --> 01:23:27.219]  But if you have the perspective of 1990, then the number of people that are now starting to see it is absolutely fantastic.
[01:23:27.799 --> 01:23:31.401]  What we've got to do is turn the seeing it into not cooperating with it.
[01:23:31.541 --> 01:23:47.891]   And, you know, I said a long time ago that it's got to get really bad before enough people will You know, concentrate their minds that actually action is necessary and necessary urgently.
[01:23:48.331 --> 01:24:01.656]  And so every time they're pushing on, and the more it impacts on people's lives, the more people are becoming aware that actually, the conspiracy theorists were not theorists at all.
[01:24:02.517 --> 01:24:03.737]  And that is happening.
[01:24:04.137 --> 01:24:11.858]   But at the same time, you've got this rolling out of this digital concentration camp.
[01:24:12.598 --> 01:24:16.059]  And that has always been the goal.
[01:24:16.439 --> 01:24:17.979]  Always been the game.
[01:24:18.719 --> 01:24:21.680]  And, you know, there's three groups of people.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:25.461]  Two of them, they've basically got.
[01:24:26.101 --> 01:24:31.282]  The second group, maybe there's potential to move across, but they've basically got them.
[01:24:31.342 --> 01:24:39.672]   The first group is people who just, um, I call them non-player characters, who just, um, Just accept what they're told without question.
[01:24:40.133 --> 01:24:42.394]  If someone in authority says it, then it must be true.
[01:24:42.935 --> 01:24:52.621]  Then you've got the second group that can actually see that something's not right and they really don't want to do what the authorities are telling them, but they fear the consequences of not doing so.
[01:24:52.881 --> 01:24:56.804]  They are basically under the control of the cult, absolutely.
[01:24:57.224 --> 01:25:08.390]   The third group, which is getting bigger, this is the point, are those that can see it more and more and are refusing to cooperate with it.
[01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:15.913]  And they're the ones, therefore, that this cult has to target more than anyone.
[01:25:16.474 --> 01:25:25.918]  First of all, they have to do everything they can to stop that group communicating what it's seen and communicating what it's researched.
[01:25:26.799 --> 01:25:31.041]  But even then, as I said earlier, they're not going to stop all of it.
[01:25:32.381 --> 01:25:35.343]  So what they have to do then, this is what this is all about.
[01:25:36.087 --> 01:26:10.508]   Is say, okay, you want to challenge us, you want to not cooperate, that's fine, but we are going to have a global digital currency, which is, it was in a book I wrote called Robots Rebellion in 1992, it came out in 93, about this end of cash and the one world currency, that we are going to not only Have a digital global currency, but we're going to make it programmable.
[01:26:11.368 --> 01:26:16.231]  And that means that we can dictate what you can use it for and what you can't.
[01:26:17.151 --> 01:26:22.074]  And if you want to challenge us, well, how are you going to eat?
[01:26:22.554 --> 01:26:24.295]  How are you going to pay the rent?
[01:26:24.995 --> 01:26:26.856]  How are you going to survive?
[01:26:27.216 --> 01:26:28.757]  Because you're not going to be able to.
[01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:45.663]   And what we've seen, Alex, in the last few days in Britain Is a precursor of that, as Nigel Farage has come out, because he's well known, it's got publicity, but loads and loads of other people before him have gone through the same thing.
[01:26:45.763 --> 01:26:47.124]  I mean, I've been debanked.
[01:26:47.184 --> 01:26:48.605]  I would imagine you've been messed with, right?
[01:26:49.746 --> 01:26:51.127]  Well, I was banned from PayPal.
[01:26:51.147 --> 01:26:52.348]  I didn't even bloody use it.
[01:26:52.848 --> 01:27:04.133]   But the thing is that the banks are now starting to say, If you have the wrong opinion, you can't have a bank account.
[01:27:04.554 --> 01:27:22.941]  Now, okay, the idea, of course, is to get rid of cash so you can't operate outside the banking system to get this digital currency in, which is programmable, so they have complete control over your finances and your ability to function.
[01:27:23.281 --> 01:27:31.622]   And all that Is targeting this third group, the awakening group, the increasingly maverick group.
[01:27:32.162 --> 01:27:33.944]  And that's why they're doing it.
[01:27:34.744 --> 01:27:37.887]  Well I totally agree and they admit that they want to use it for control over us.
[01:27:37.907 --> 01:27:38.567]  Let me ask you this.
[01:27:39.688 --> 01:27:48.952]   If this group had their druthers, Do we just get used for body parts for a cyborg system like you've all Noah Harari talks about?
[01:27:49.172 --> 01:27:52.395]  Or is it a childhood's end type scenario?
[01:27:52.936 --> 01:28:02.325]  If this outside alien group had its way, the satanic group had its way, what would the world look like versus you predicted the future before you say we're going to win?
[01:28:02.685 --> 01:28:04.367]  How do you see this battle unfolding?
[01:28:04.387 --> 01:28:15.097]   I know you say it's up to us, and I agree with you, but Looking into the future again, like you did on my show 20 years ago, 25 years ago, give us your projection into what you see unfolding.
[01:28:16.338 --> 01:28:18.260]  Okay, well, I mean, this is far out.
[01:28:19.041 --> 01:28:22.124]  I go into this deeply in the dream.
[01:28:23.946 --> 01:28:31.774]  Think of this astral dimension, which is interpenetrating ours, and it's a range of frequency.
[01:28:32.677 --> 01:28:44.781]  So at the top end of the astral dimension is much higher frequency, much more awareness than in the lower levels where the demonic is, the lower levels of the astral.
[01:28:45.902 --> 01:28:56.045]  I wrote a book which, the first one that I wrote after my head blew off in 1990, it was called Truth Vibrations.
[01:28:57.205 --> 01:29:15.603]  And I named that because what I gleaned, various ways that I explained, was that a vibrational change was coming, a frequency change, that was going to awaken humanity from its slumber, from its coma.
[01:29:16.543 --> 01:29:20.167]  And the people that were more awake were going to be affected first.
[01:29:20.962 --> 01:29:26.284]  And then eventually people who were fast asleep, solid gold asleep, were going to start to be affected.
[01:29:26.864 --> 01:29:34.326]  Now in 1990 there was no evidence that that was the case, but now look at it and you can see the impact.
[01:29:34.987 --> 01:29:54.038]   Now this Truth Vibrations as I called it, I called it Truth Vibrations because what I was told is that and what I gleaned, various ways that I explained, Was that all that had been hidden from us, this frequency change was going to bring to the surface so that we could see it.
[01:29:54.858 --> 01:29:58.039]  Now, and this is what I wrote in 1990.
[01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:03.801]  Now, look at what we know now, Alex, that we didn't know then.
[01:30:04.222 --> 01:30:08.983]  Look at what we know now that we didn't know a year ago, five years ago, ten years ago, twenty years ago.
[01:30:09.623 --> 01:30:10.744]  This is happening.
[01:30:10.924 --> 01:30:31.027]   And in terms of this astral dimension, This truth vibration frequency that is rebalancing everything from its imbalance, from its distortion, is coming down the astral frequencies and it's coming down towards this demonic realm.
[01:30:31.888 --> 01:30:42.656]  And this demonic realm is seeking to retreat into this reality because of what's going on.
[01:30:43.971 --> 01:30:55.219]  And as a result it's created this technological system so that it can enter more and more our reality.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:07.067]  And this lower astral level, the demonic, is chaotic, it's inverted, it's crazy, it's a mess, it's full of upheaval.
[01:31:07.087 --> 01:31:16.997]   And what you're seeing in the world Is that being transferred into our world?
[01:31:17.037 --> 01:31:21.980]  So it's becoming more and more crazy, more and more... And by the way, let me interrupt you.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:32.006]  This is totally on target for my own research and just spiritual gut level analysis and, you know, the spirit, is that that's why even the top globalists no longer say they're atheists.
[01:31:32.026 --> 01:31:33.327]  They go, oh yeah, there is something.
[01:31:33.347 --> 01:31:34.448]  We're in artificial reality.
[01:31:34.908 --> 01:31:35.808]  It's enslaved us.
[01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:39.431]  And they're trying to create a silicon new reality to escape to.
[01:31:40.811 --> 01:31:43.953]  Because their false satanic reality is being bombarded.
[01:31:44.253 --> 01:31:57.719]  So all they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off and freaking out and all these acts of power and control is them basically going into a death spiral or a spasm.
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:31:59.520]  Do you agree with that and speak to that?
[01:32:00.481 --> 01:32:02.462]  Well, they're like ducks.
[01:32:03.582 --> 01:32:06.944]  They serenely make their speeches.
[01:32:07.944 --> 01:32:12.708]  Serenely say what's going to happen, but their little feet are going like that under the water.
[01:32:13.849 --> 01:32:25.479]  Because, you know, the only way that this demonic realm can control humans is if humans stay unconscious.
[01:32:26.388 --> 01:33:01.513]   When we expand our awareness, when we put aside all preconceived idea and preconceived belief in reality and everything and say I'm gonna let my own experience and information be my guide and not preconceived idea, you start to realize what the game is and the more people that awaken to that The more that energy of awakening will dominate this, these village idiots, that's what they are.
[01:33:02.173 --> 01:33:08.298]  You know, you know, in the in the kingdom of the blind, the one eyed man is king.
[01:33:08.719 --> 01:33:16.185]  It's very, very appropriate that one of their major symbols is a single eye, because they are the one eyed man.
[01:33:16.906 --> 01:33:24.031]  And they have prevailed this far by keeping humans blind in both eyes.
[01:33:24.812 --> 01:33:27.994]  It's not that they are omnipotent and all-powerful.
[01:33:28.234 --> 01:33:29.195]  Bunch of prats!
[01:33:30.556 --> 01:33:37.641]  Anyone that wants to control everything like they do is obviously suffering from extreme levels of insecurity for a start.
[01:33:37.941 --> 01:33:39.903]  Secure people don't want to control others.
[01:33:39.923 --> 01:33:43.065]  They just want to get on with their lives and let others get on with their lives.
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.381]  So, these are not all powerful.
[01:33:46.461 --> 01:33:46.961]  They're not.
[01:33:47.381 --> 01:33:49.922]  The trick is to convince us that they are.
[01:33:50.522 --> 01:33:51.562]  It's like authority.
[01:33:51.902 --> 01:33:58.724]  Authority in the human world of the scene is simply the demonic made manifest in our reality.
[01:33:58.964 --> 01:34:03.025]  So people say, well, you can't go against authority, it's too powerful.
[01:34:03.165 --> 01:34:03.605]  Oh, really?
[01:34:04.577 --> 01:34:10.442]  What if millions or billions of people say to authority, a tiny number, we're not having it?
[01:34:10.462 --> 01:34:11.963]  Well, let me raise an example of that.
[01:34:12.443 --> 01:34:16.366]  You and I saw this over a decade ago, but the world sees an analysis to show it.
[01:34:16.386 --> 01:34:19.209]  Even the Hollywood stars come out and say, everyone hates this.
[01:34:19.249 --> 01:34:22.191]  There's nothing more uncool than being a Hollywood star.
[01:34:23.172 --> 01:34:30.438]  You see Prince Charles, King Charles, basically almost everybody laughing at him and their little ridiculous outfits, their regalia.
[01:34:32.014 --> 01:34:40.380]  But do you think the establishment, who's retreated into their bubbles, realizes that the world is turning against them very, very quickly?
[01:34:43.142 --> 01:34:44.063]  Well, I think they do.
[01:34:44.423 --> 01:35:00.855]  And, you know, once they put themselves on public display, which was basically when the COVID card was played, they knew that when they played that, great vast numbers of people just go along nodding dogs.
[01:35:01.795 --> 01:35:11.681]  But they would awaken significant numbers of people who wouldn't go that direction and would see it and would awaken to more as a result.
[01:35:13.002 --> 01:35:25.049]  So they have a goal of 2030, which they want to pull forward as much as they can for a simple reason.
[01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:48.573]   Once you put yourself on public display, You have a certain period, as short as you can get away with, to so literally lock down digitally and technologically, through AI, the population, before enough of them wake up to overthrow your nonsense.
[01:35:49.213 --> 01:35:51.894]  So they are really pushing this on.
[01:35:52.314 --> 01:36:02.558]   And the thing is, you know, it's what I was trying to get across in terms of the Lack of omnipotent power that they really have.
[01:36:02.639 --> 01:36:04.139]  Their power is the power we give them.
[01:36:05.179 --> 01:36:12.540]  And that is that you can look at censorship and you can say, oh, that's where they've got the power of censorship.
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:13.260]  Yeah.
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:15.601]  But what's censorship really?
[01:36:16.181 --> 01:36:17.901]  It's an expression of fear.
[01:36:18.861 --> 01:36:25.702]  Because if they weren't frightened of the truth coming out, they wouldn't be censoring.
[01:36:26.483 --> 01:36:33.690]   And all this imposition of the digital currency and the digital concentration camp
[01:36:33.690 --> 01:36:41.911]   is actually an expression of desperation and fear because they know if they don't push this through fast over
[01:36:41.911 --> 01:36:47.489]   this period then enough people are going to wake up to bring it down.
[01:36:47.737 --> 01:36:49.197]  And David, I totally agree with you.
[01:36:49.578 --> 01:36:51.799]  And so you're talking 35,000 foot view here.
[01:36:52.499 --> 01:36:57.362]  But for the listeners who do want these questions drilled into, we know the enemy is going to strike back.
[01:36:57.422 --> 01:37:04.466]  So what do you make of the Ukraine war, of Zelensky, of them saying the Russians are going to blow up the nuclear power plant in the next few days with no evidence?
[01:37:05.346 --> 01:37:08.247]  What do you make of Biden, who they obviously want to get rid of now?
[01:37:08.307 --> 01:37:09.208]  Who are they going to bring in?
[01:37:09.228 --> 01:37:18.932]  I mean, just as they know they're losing their power and they're desperately trying to bring in their world government, their world currency, everything we said openly happening, we're totally vindicated.
[01:37:19.753 --> 01:37:21.613]  But that's us saying, hey, we were right in the past.
[01:37:22.194 --> 01:37:26.176]  Listeners, again, want to know what's coming in the future and what we do to counter this.
[01:37:26.216 --> 01:37:28.497]  So let me let's walk through a few scenarios here.
[01:37:28.657 --> 01:37:29.157]  Ukraine war.
[01:37:31.929 --> 01:37:43.378]  Well, I've been saying for decades that the plan was to bring the West into conflict with an alliance of Russia and China, with Iran thrown in and stuff like that.
[01:37:43.458 --> 01:37:47.702]  It doesn't necessarily have to be a military conflict.
[01:37:47.962 --> 01:37:48.662]  Well, it could be.
[01:37:48.682 --> 01:37:52.005]  It can be an economic conflict.
[01:37:52.085 --> 01:37:56.096]   And, you know, China Is the key.
[01:37:56.116 --> 01:38:01.359]  I mean, we're talking about Russia and Ukraine, but in the background is the biggie.
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:05.682]  China is the blueprint for the world.
[01:38:06.422 --> 01:38:12.946]  And the Mao Revolution, I suggest, was actually a cult revolution using a front man called Mao.
[01:38:13.807 --> 01:38:31.901]   And the idea was to create a closed society in which a system of mass control, not least through technology, Could be incubated and perfected and then played out across the world.
[01:38:32.161 --> 01:39:02.084]   And so that's why we've had this, if you want to connect a few dots, not only has the Chinese system been played out more and more across the world since the quote COVID, which came out where it's a set of China, You've had for decades, US corporations that are not US corporations and they're not European corporations, they're cult corporations, the same cult that controls China.
[01:39:03.285 --> 01:39:07.074]   They've been outsourcing their I totally agree.
[01:39:07.094 --> 01:39:07.555]  Stay right there.
[01:39:07.575 --> 01:39:09.896]  We got a break in a few minutes, but we got a futile break.
[01:39:09.916 --> 01:39:13.738]  But it's on record that China has been given control of 98% of rare earth minerals for all the electronics.
[01:39:13.757 --> 01:39:20.436]   in terms of supply, of producing and supplying basic products, etc.
[01:39:20.436 --> 01:39:22.837]  This has all been orchestrated.
[01:39:22.837 --> 01:39:23.837]  I totally agree.
[01:39:23.837 --> 01:39:24.837]  Stay right there.
[01:39:24.837 --> 01:39:26.356]  We got to break in a few minutes, but we got a futile break.
[01:39:26.356 --> 01:39:30.657]   But it's on record that China has been given control of 98% of rare earth minerals for
[01:39:30.657 --> 01:39:32.136]  all the electronics.
[01:39:32.136 --> 01:39:38.398]   It's on record that the CIA and 49 double-crossed Chiang Kai-shek and Back Mao.
[01:39:38.398 --> 01:39:40.476]  It's on record that it wasn't Nixon that opened it up.
[01:39:40.476 --> 01:39:42.318]  He just made the alliance public.
[01:39:42.318 --> 01:39:46.556]   So quantify, when you say cult, people always say who runs it, what runs it.
[01:39:46.556 --> 01:39:51.717]   It's different bloodlines, different elites that resonate with this anti-human destructive
[01:39:51.717 --> 01:39:54.077]  force and that they have built China up.
[01:39:54.077 --> 01:39:58.557]   I mean, 90% of it didn't have electricity 60 years ago into this juggernaut.
[01:39:58.557 --> 01:39:59.957]  Who is the cult?
[01:39:59.957 --> 01:40:05.197]   And then continue, because it's not debated that the CIA put Mao Zedong into power.
[01:40:05.197 --> 01:40:06.197]  Who is the cult?
[01:40:06.197 --> 01:40:07.757]  What is their plan for China?
[01:40:07.757 --> 01:40:08.757]  Okay.
[01:40:08.757 --> 01:40:16.877]   So if people just imagine a massive spider's web around the world and there's a spider
[01:40:16.877 --> 01:40:17.476]  in the middle.
[01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:22.524]  Now that spider ultimately are these astral demonic forces.
[01:40:24.525 --> 01:40:33.533]  The strands immediately around the spider are the most secretive secret societies that will know pretty much all that's happening.
[01:40:34.193 --> 01:40:51.248]   As you come out from the spider still in the hidden You're coming into the secret societies we know of, the Freemasons, the inner core of them, the Knights of Malta, the Knights Templar, the inner core of the Jesuit Order, on and on.
[01:40:52.265 --> 01:40:56.591]  Um, skull and bones is an expression of it in America, of course.
[01:40:56.971 --> 01:41:02.598]  And as you come out, you eventually reach what I call the cusp, the cusp in the web.
[01:41:02.978 --> 01:41:06.263]  And this cusp is where the hidden meets the seen.
[01:41:06.863 --> 01:41:31.062]   And at that cusp are the Bilderberg Group, the World Economic Forum, the explosion of think tanks and Soros-funded, often non-governmental organizations, the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the other expressions of that network as well.
[01:41:31.563 --> 01:41:39.288]  And their job at the cusp is to take the agenda coming through the hidden from the spider and play it out.
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:49.707]  into the public arena, the world of the scene, through corporations and Silicon Valley and governments and banks and World Health Organization and so on.
[01:41:50.308 --> 01:42:15.992]   And so when you see that, and you then start to see that what appear to be random, unconnected corporations, World Health Organization, Silicon Valley and so on, CDC, Big Pharma, If you go deep enough in these organizations and companies, you meet that level of them which connects to the web.
[01:42:16.032 --> 01:42:20.715]  Stay there, because with the hearings last few months and this judge's ruling, that just came out.
[01:42:20.775 --> 01:42:28.919]  Intelligence agencies, government, big tech, media, all working behind the scenes in secret to surveil and suppress the speech of Americans.
[01:42:28.939 --> 01:42:30.260]  We know it's the same thing overseas.
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:32.782]  So there is some good forces fighting back.
[01:42:32.922 --> 01:42:34.264]  Why is it coming to the surface?
[01:42:34.644 --> 01:42:36.906]  That tells me evil is not fully in power.
[01:42:37.247 --> 01:42:39.008]  Incredible first hour of the David Icke.
[01:42:39.029 --> 01:42:40.750]  Hour number two straight ahead.

[01:42:48.516 --> 01:43:01.516]  [Intro]
[01:43:01.516 --> 01:43:05.516]  July 4th, 2023 is here.
[01:43:05.554 --> 01:43:16.601]  Declare independence against the globalists, against Klaus Schwab, against the WAF, against the UN and their new worldwide medical treaty claiming control over not just our nation state's medical systems, but our very bodies.
[01:43:17.041 --> 01:43:22.084]  Declare independence against the federal government that's been captured at the top by globalist operatives.
[01:43:22.424 --> 01:43:26.166]  Declare independence against Big Pharma and GMO and Bill Gates.
[01:43:26.527 --> 01:43:30.009]  Declare independence against Satan and his entire operation against you and your family.
[01:43:30.469 --> 01:43:40.276]  And the place to join the resistance, to fight the New World Order, and to get the latest information and intel is InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Band.Video.
[01:43:40.336 --> 01:43:46.520]  And if you can't share those links because of Big Brother, you can share currently a URL, they're not blocking, MadMaxWorld.tv.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:58.308]  We're fighting hard, you're fighting hard, and I want to salute you all on this July 4th, 2023, and encourage you all to spread the word about InfoWars.com and get amazing products at InfoWarsStore.com today.
[01:43:58.548 --> 01:43:59.829]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:00.090 --> 01:44:01.446]  Declare independence fraternity now!
[01:44:02.748 --> 01:44:05.730]  All right, some stations don't carry this first five minutes, but the internet does.
[01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:21.199]  So I'm going to ask David to talk about any topic he wants for five minutes, and then when we come back from break, we'll continue with that key point he hit at the end of the hour just minutes ago about these webs of control between corporate and government that look separate but are actually the same group, the cult.
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:24.281]  Such an important point, he'll finish in about five minutes.
[01:44:24.461 --> 01:44:30.105]  But David, in this little five minutes, what is it like to be vindicated completely?
[01:44:32.768 --> 01:44:45.821]  Well, um, like you said, um, earlier on in the show, um, it gives you no pleasure to see, uh, what you said was coming to have arrived.
[01:44:46.622 --> 01:44:51.106]  Um, because, uh, you know, people say, how did you know?
[01:44:52.207 --> 01:44:56.111]  But my answer to that is because it's not random.
[01:44:56.897 --> 01:45:04.663]  You know, if you're saying this is what's going to happen and it's all random, well, what's the chances of you getting it right or anything close to being right?
[01:45:05.284 --> 01:45:08.066]  You get it right because it's a plan.
[01:45:08.166 --> 01:45:11.368]  And if you uncover the plan, you can predict the future.
[01:45:12.029 --> 01:45:14.571]  But you're not actually predicting the future.
[01:45:14.651 --> 01:45:21.256]  You're predicting the future if there's no intervention by humans on the plan.
[01:45:22.202 --> 01:45:44.354]  And so the more this plays out in the way that you kind of say this is what is planned and it happens, it's a bit disappointing really because the idea is, the idea of what I do, what we do, is to alert enough people to stop that happening, to make sure it doesn't play out.
[01:45:45.134 --> 01:45:50.956]  And like I said earlier, though, it has to get really bad to concentrate enough minds.
[01:45:51.536 --> 01:45:54.597]  And we are moving into that area now.
[01:45:54.637 --> 01:46:04.460]  I mean, after COVID, more and more people came, but more and more people will when they start to see that actually it's not a myth, it's not a theory, it's actually happening.
[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:10.201]  But it's like I say, I want to emphasize that it's not about predicting the future.
[01:46:10.221 --> 01:46:12.342]  It's about predicting the plan.
[01:46:13.032 --> 01:46:17.235]  And the idea is the plan doesn't become the future because enough people intervene.
[01:46:18.196 --> 01:46:20.958]  So to answer the question, it gives you no...
[01:46:22.083 --> 01:46:23.243]  Satisfaction, really.
[01:46:23.343 --> 01:46:33.126]  I mean, it does give you confidence that you're on the right track and that what you're doing and how you're researching and how you're coming across all this is valid because it turns out that it's true.
[01:46:33.786 --> 01:46:35.807]  But it's not something you want to be.
[01:46:36.087 --> 01:46:47.630]  I mean, I don't want to be here a few years from now, as I will be, by the way, and having this chat and saying, well, you know, people are now being connected to AI en masse.
[01:46:47.670 --> 01:46:49.251]  You know, I told you that was coming.
[01:46:50.692 --> 01:46:52.395]  That's no satisfaction at all.
[01:46:53.716 --> 01:47:00.164]  If you can avoid it happening by human intervention, that's the real reason we do what we do, of course.
[01:47:00.325 --> 01:47:01.666]  And I totally agree with what you said.
[01:47:01.686 --> 01:47:06.292]  I've interviewed you probably 50 times, been very blessed to be at some of the same events as you and have dinner with you.
[01:47:07.153 --> 01:47:09.174]  When we cover Bilderberg together and some other times.
[01:47:09.695 --> 01:47:11.436]  But what you just said is the most important thing ever.
[01:47:11.676 --> 01:47:13.397]  We're not predicting the future.
[01:47:13.977 --> 01:47:20.381]  It's a set plan that if we let them continue to hijack the train or the plane, we're going to go to the destination they want.
[01:47:20.882 --> 01:47:22.203]  But of course, none of it's random.
[01:47:22.223 --> 01:47:27.506]  We're able to predict what's going to happen once we say their operations because they are in somewhat control now.
[01:47:27.886 --> 01:47:29.667]  But more and more, they're not in control.
[01:47:30.008 --> 01:47:31.308]  And that's for the most important part.
[01:47:31.328 --> 01:47:33.870]   We're not just Hijack bystanders here.
[01:47:33.930 --> 01:47:40.792]  If we get engaged and informed, we collectively can take control of our destiny together and take it away from these people.
[01:47:42.133 --> 01:47:43.493]  Well, it's a very simple thing.
[01:47:43.593 --> 01:47:44.434]  It's mathematics.
[01:47:44.494 --> 01:47:47.435]  I mean, get yourself, people, a pocket calculator.
[01:47:49.416 --> 01:47:57.599]  Tap in 8 billion people and then take away the handful relative to 8 billion that are running the show.
[01:47:58.199 --> 01:47:59.600]  And I think I see a way out of this.
[01:48:01.122 --> 01:48:05.769]  The idea... Wouldn't you say it's maybe a thousand people that are in on the whole conspiracy?
[01:48:07.611 --> 01:48:14.021]  I think, Alex, that if you get to the core of the core of the core of the core, you'd get them in a single room.
[01:48:14.982 --> 01:48:24.715]   But the thing is that Their power is only in manipulating people to give their power to them.
[01:48:24.736 --> 01:48:25.958]  They have no power.
[01:48:26.018 --> 01:48:31.727]  Clearly, a handful relative to the population can't have power over the population.
[01:48:32.398 --> 01:48:36.601]  Without the acceptance and acquiescence of the population.
[01:48:37.001 --> 01:48:39.282]  So that's what we're working towards, obvious.
[01:48:39.802 --> 01:48:40.383]  Stay there.
[01:48:40.583 --> 01:48:48.548]  We're going to come back to where you got cut off six minutes ago when the last hour ended, when you were saying it's all out in the open, that it's compartmentalized spiderweb.
[01:48:49.428 --> 01:48:51.449]  Finish up that important point, we'll come back in 60 seconds.
[01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:55.872]  Alright, I don't say this to be on a power trip because it's the opposite.
[01:48:57.498 --> 01:48:59.920]  I say it so people pay attention and really think about what's happening.
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:16.830]  Together, on this show right now, David Icke was awake before I was, and I've obviously been as successful as he has in getting people to awaken to the New World Order, but he's really been the trailblazer on how the thing operates and what they would pull and what they would do.
[01:49:17.911 --> 01:49:21.896]  I would say in some ways I may have been more successful at actually reaching more people, but that's up in the air.
[01:49:22.156 --> 01:49:23.458]  It's not about keeping score here.
[01:49:23.478 --> 01:49:24.339]  We're all on the same team.
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:29.185]  Team consciousness, team freedom, you know, team free will.
[01:49:30.166 --> 01:49:34.371]  But now it's out in the open that David's been hammering on for 30 plus years.
[01:49:35.922 --> 01:49:56.750]  That it's a spider's web and the corporations at the top act like they're different but they're really on the same team and that government is interface and governments look different but most of the major governments are controlled by the same cult and now that's really come out in the congressional hearings with all the big tech and the intelligence agencies censoring and surveilling and controlling and there's really a great awakening to this.
[01:49:56.790 --> 01:50:00.451]  So you got cut off by the brig at the end of the last hour, David, talking about that.
[01:50:02.239 --> 01:50:30.998]  Yeah, so once you realize that these corporations and governments, court systems, judiciaries, banking systems, Silicon Valley, World Health Organization, World Trade Organization, are actually connected to this web, and of course through compartmentalization it means the vast majority of people in those organizations, indeed in those governments, have no idea there is a web.
[01:50:32.313 --> 01:50:38.196]  So, you have this network which is connecting these organisations.
[01:50:38.256 --> 01:50:39.777]  Now, this explains a great deal.
[01:50:40.498 --> 01:50:55.446]  So, when the COVID card was played, Silicon Valley announced that it was going to censor anyone that challenged the official story of COVID coming out of the World Health Organisation.
[01:50:56.002 --> 01:51:02.345]  Now, if you look at that from a bigger picture point of view, you'd say, well, hold on a minute.
[01:51:03.185 --> 01:51:08.348]  You're supposed to be the town square where we all have our opinion and then people make up their mind what to believe.
[01:51:08.688 --> 01:51:10.869]  What are you doing announcing right at the start?
[01:51:11.778 --> 01:51:21.125]  You're going to censor anyone that challenges the World Health Organization narrative, because the World Health Organization is an asset of the cult.
[01:51:21.185 --> 01:51:30.311]  It was created by the cult through the Rockefeller family, not least, in 1948, and Silicon Valley is a cult operation.
[01:51:31.151 --> 01:51:46.832]   Therefore, the Silicon Valley corporations and platforms censoring on behalf of the cult a narrative The anyone that challenges the World Health Organization, a cult operation.
[01:51:47.272 --> 01:51:49.113]  Then you've got Big Pharma.
[01:51:49.193 --> 01:51:52.815]  Big Pharma is an absolute cult operation.
[01:51:53.516 --> 01:51:57.158]  And you know, it's a satanic organization, obviously, just as the cult is.
[01:51:57.918 --> 01:52:11.911]   So you know, because you know that if you go deep enough in the CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, you're going to get To the point where they interact with the web.
[01:52:12.592 --> 01:52:35.764]  So, you know that when Big Pharma comes along with Pfizer and Moderna, whatever, and asks the apparent regulatory agency of government, supposed to protect the people from Big Pharma, for permission to use their fake vaccine on younger and younger and more and more people, you know they're going to get it.
[01:52:36.593 --> 01:52:48.340]  Because what's happening is Big Pharma, the cult, is going to the CDC and the FDA, the cult, and asking for permission to advance a cult agenda.
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:50.161]  So obviously they're going to get it.
[01:52:50.641 --> 01:52:52.022]  So this is how it works.
[01:52:52.062 --> 01:53:09.219]   So now you start to see that while you are looking at banks, plural, You're actually looking at bank singular, not least coordinated through organizations like the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland.
[01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:22.492]  So now you see why suddenly these different banks are all working as one to say, no, if you've got the wrong opinion, then you're not going to have a bank account.
[01:53:22.772 --> 01:53:24.734]  Now you look at the digital currency.
[01:53:25.434 --> 01:53:36.738]  Suddenly, all over the world, the central banks, coordinated through the Bank for International Settlements, are saying we want to introduce a digital currency.
[01:53:37.418 --> 01:53:37.838]  Why?
[01:53:37.998 --> 01:53:38.458]  How?
[01:53:38.818 --> 01:53:40.019]  How is it coordinated?
[01:53:40.399 --> 01:53:41.639]  Through the cult!
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:43.440]  This is how it works.
[01:53:44.395 --> 01:53:51.819]  Are we really believing that suddenly people all over the world in authority have the same idea?
[01:53:51.839 --> 01:53:55.901]  Of, I know, I've got a great idea, I woke up with it this morning.
[01:53:56.201 --> 01:53:59.203]  What we're going to do is we're going to put drag queens into schools.
[01:53:59.723 --> 01:54:05.386]  And we're going to get them to read stories, first of all, and then we're going to get them to strut their stuff as we expand it.
[01:54:06.132 --> 01:54:08.355]  This is cult organization.
[01:54:08.435 --> 01:54:10.859]  This is why the same things happen everywhere.
[01:54:11.079 --> 01:54:20.373]  And that's all admitted now that Bill Gates and the UN created global standardized systems for central bank digital currencies in the last decade with the Carnegie Foundation and the CIA.
[01:54:21.373 --> 01:54:25.373]   The US government's quarterbacking the new UN treaty, which is really a US treaty.
[01:54:25.373 --> 01:54:29.373]   Just like the group that runs the US created the UN, it's the same cult.
[01:54:29.373 --> 01:54:32.373]   When you get down to the Trilateral Commission, CFR, Bilderberg Group,
[01:54:32.373 --> 01:54:36.373]   it's the same hundred people that head up all the major organizations.
[01:54:36.373 --> 01:54:39.373]   Peter Hotez came out and said, "Oh, I don't take any money from Big Pharma."
[01:54:40.048 --> 01:54:43.630]  He just takes it from Bill Gates, and then he comes up with what Bill Gates wants.
[01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:47.431]  That gets recommended and adopted by government, then buys it from Bill Gates.
[01:54:48.072 --> 01:54:49.652]  So no, Big Pharma's not funding him.
[01:54:49.952 --> 01:54:59.376]  Hotez makes the corporate recommendations that then buy the product from Bill Gates, but Bill Gates funds Hotez in their research, and he lies to us like we're idiots.
[01:54:59.896 --> 01:55:03.057]  But what does it mean now that these judges are coming out and exposing this?
[01:55:03.377 --> 01:55:06.399]  I mean, I don't think the elites are the elites.
[01:55:06.879 --> 01:55:08.179]  I don't think they're in total control.
[01:55:08.199 --> 01:55:14.702]  I think we're seeing the cracks in the system as more people in the system that were compartmentalized, David Icke, decide to not go along with it.
[01:55:16.002 --> 01:55:17.543]  Well, yeah, that's a point.
[01:55:19.423 --> 01:55:35.165]   The system is so fiercely compartmentalized That people within it every day are contributing to this agenda's playing out without knowing there even is an agenda.
[01:55:35.605 --> 01:55:36.505]  This is the point.
[01:55:37.085 --> 01:55:42.827]  And I remember speaking at an event in London a long time ago now.
[01:55:43.768 --> 01:55:53.631]  And a guy came up to me afterwards and he was a retired leading executive of Shell Oil in South America.
[01:55:54.821 --> 01:56:07.045]  And he came to me, he said, I've just realized, listening to you, why so many things happened when I was working for Shell that I didn't understand at the time.
[01:56:07.906 --> 01:56:10.146]  And this is the compartmentalization.
[01:56:10.266 --> 01:56:24.686]   And what, you know, the alternative media putting this information out, some of us decade after decade, of course, it's decompartmentalizing That structure.
[01:56:24.706 --> 01:56:33.189]  Because people are getting it within the system from outside the system, and thus they want to silence us.
[01:56:34.069 --> 01:56:51.634]  So these people, these renegade people, who may not know the big picture at all, but they get that what they're being pressured to do is not what they should do, they are starting to rebel and they're starting to say, no, no, I'm not going along with it.
[01:56:52.114 --> 01:56:53.075]  It was kind of interesting.
[01:56:53.095 --> 01:57:02.300]  I mean, I don't know how this is going to play out, but I was banned from 26 European countries by the Dutch government through the Schengen system.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:04.042]  You're banned from one, you're banned from them all.
[01:57:04.642 --> 01:57:06.783]  And we've been challenging them in the courts.
[01:57:07.984 --> 01:57:14.368]  And we went to the district judge, first of all, and he did everything but walk into the bloody court with a rubber stamp, you know.
[01:57:15.177 --> 01:57:22.121]  But we had another hearing a couple of weeks ago, and I don't know whether she's going to have the, you know, the backbone to go all the way through with it.
[01:57:22.842 --> 01:57:24.403]  But I'm listening to this.
[01:57:24.523 --> 01:57:29.726]  I'm obviously not allowed into the Netherlands, so I'm on kind of Zoom or something.
[01:57:30.526 --> 01:57:36.950]  And she started asking the government lawyer very forensic questions.
[01:57:37.150 --> 01:57:39.412]  And I'm going, whoa, this is a bit different.
[01:57:40.132 --> 01:57:41.053]  She wasn't having it.
[01:57:41.253 --> 01:57:44.615]  And the government lawyer was getting more and more flustered because he had no evidence.
[01:57:45.895 --> 01:57:49.976]  And then a few days later, she said, OK, I'll rule at the end of the month.
[01:57:50.557 --> 01:57:55.578]  A few days later, my lawyer in the Netherlands got a contact from her.
[01:57:56.938 --> 01:58:02.340]  And what's happened is she's actually looked into the law through which I was supposed to be banned.
[01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:05.601]  And she found that the law has been changed.
[01:58:05.681 --> 01:58:07.302]  The Schengen law has been changed.
[01:58:07.802 --> 01:58:16.538]   So the law that they banned me with by interpreting it in a most ridiculous, ludicrous way, but
[01:58:16.538 --> 01:58:22.778]   anyway, the law that they used was actually removed in March and she saw that, first judge,
[01:58:22.778 --> 01:58:28.538]   and she did because she was forensic, she wasn't just rubber stamping, she was saying, "I'm,
[01:58:28.538 --> 01:58:31.818]   actually, I want to know more about this and why you banned this man."
[01:58:31.999 --> 01:58:39.947]  Well you always talk about that with your Bilderberg analogy where you're in Europe and go to the Bilderberg group and there's the military keeping you from going up the hill to cover it when they themselves are being oppressed.
[01:58:40.307 --> 01:58:43.090]  So here's this judge that's not acting as a repeater.
[01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:47.594]  She's actually going and doing research being a human and that breaks their control.
[01:58:48.515 --> 01:58:58.433]   Yes and we'll see if she's got the backbone because basically Given what she's found, then the ban should be dismissed.
[01:58:58.874 --> 01:59:04.458]  But we'll see if she'll go against the Dutch government, which is seriously satanic and seriously fascist.
[01:59:04.518 --> 01:59:05.199]  I can't tell you.
[01:59:05.219 --> 01:59:07.121]  The Dutch government is one of the worst in the world.
[01:59:07.141 --> 01:59:08.041]  Well, let's talk about that.
[01:59:08.102 --> 01:59:16.229]  Why are they, of course, their minister that says he's going to ban their farms and already banned a large part of them, saying nitrogen is bad when it's the largest part of the atmosphere.
[01:59:17.249 --> 01:59:20.192]  He's now been rewarded to be the UN Head of Food Operations.
[01:59:20.692 --> 01:59:23.394]  Now Ireland's announcing they're going to start banning their farmers.
[01:59:23.734 --> 01:59:30.259]  I mean, this is getting really naked when they're going to ban farmers and say they're, I mean, including plant crops.
[01:59:30.619 --> 01:59:32.561]  I mean, can you speak to cutting off the food agenda?
[01:59:34.382 --> 01:59:41.828]  Yeah, well, if you're going to control people that don't want to be controlled, we're back to that third group again.
[01:59:42.992 --> 01:59:50.340]  Then you have to create a system of control called dependency.
[01:59:51.201 --> 01:59:55.345]  This is what the so-called universal basic income is about.
[01:59:55.765 --> 02:00:01.049]  It's about destroying jobs, not least through AI, but inflation and many other things.
[02:00:02.290 --> 02:00:11.658]  So that if you're going to survive, you have to have the universal basic income, and that will come with consequences.
[02:00:12.119 --> 02:00:15.061]  If you challenge us, I mean, just look at what the banks are doing now.
[02:00:15.121 --> 02:00:18.124]  If you challenge us, if you have the wrong opinion, you're not going to get it.
[02:00:19.184 --> 02:00:29.519]  And so if you want to create dependency, thus control, you have to control that which people are dependent upon.
[02:00:29.539 --> 02:00:35.127]  And in the world that we live, apart from water and oxygen, it's food.
[02:00:35.791 --> 02:00:39.374]  So, what they're seeking to do is control food.
[02:00:39.774 --> 02:00:49.121]  Now, Mark Rutter, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, and all I'll say is, look at his eyes and I'll tell you who he is.
[02:00:50.262 --> 02:00:54.386]  He is a gopher for Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum.
[02:00:54.846 --> 02:00:59.329]  And the World Economic Forum has this food hub plan.
[02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.871]  Oh, food hub!
[02:01:02.139 --> 02:01:04.021]  Control of food, in other words.
[02:01:04.662 --> 02:01:15.575]  And Rutter actually made a speech in 2021 in which he said that the Netherlands is going to support the World Economic Forum food hubs.
[02:01:15.595 --> 02:01:21.922]  He said it at the Davos and that the Netherlands is going to be the headquarters of it.
[02:01:22.566 --> 02:01:28.251]  Because Rutter is a 100% cult operative.
[02:01:28.631 --> 02:01:34.677]  He's a gopher, he's nothing, you know, up there, but he's absolutely doing the cult's bidding.
[02:01:34.977 --> 02:01:36.378]  So is Tony Blair.
[02:01:36.799 --> 02:01:46.967]   That's why when either of them open their mouth, Biden too, when he can open his mouth, They are speaking the agenda of the cult.
[02:01:47.627 --> 02:01:49.608]  How do we know what the agenda of the cult is?
[02:01:49.628 --> 02:01:51.449]  Well, what's Tony Blair calling for?
[02:01:51.729 --> 02:01:53.110]  What's Rutter calling for?
[02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:55.472]  What's the Biden administration calling for?
[02:01:55.492 --> 02:01:56.152]  That'll tell you.
[02:01:56.392 --> 02:01:59.954]  What's Ardern, when she was Prime Minister of New Zealand, calling for?
[02:02:01.035 --> 02:02:07.379]  This is how you know, because these cult gophers are telling you in the way that they are saying this is what needs to happen.
[02:02:08.070 --> 02:02:08.973]  I totally agree, David.
[02:02:09.033 --> 02:02:11.599]  I've got so many questions I want to ask you here.
[02:02:12.662 --> 02:02:13.705]  But looking at this...
[02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:17.311]  I knew when I was reading their documents 30 years ago, it was real.
[02:02:18.132 --> 02:02:18.933]  You knew it was real.
[02:02:19.453 --> 02:02:20.895]  I woke up to it from research.
[02:02:20.935 --> 02:02:24.759]  You woke up through revelation, which I think is the best way for it to happen.
[02:02:24.779 --> 02:02:37.271]  And I'm getting more reports from people that are getting thunderstruck, kind of like Saul on the road to Damascus, you know, becoming Paul, you know, gets hit by the bolt of light and, you know, sees the light and has this download.
[02:02:37.932 --> 02:02:43.151]   Can you speak to the download you received,
[02:02:43.151 --> 02:02:46.831]   and then because people want to know, I want to go back to the start,
[02:02:46.831 --> 02:02:51.471]   like in the download you got, like okay, there's this alien group,
[02:02:51.471 --> 02:02:54.951]   it's like reptoids, they kill children to open up dimensions,
[02:02:54.951 --> 02:02:59.311]   because we know this is all going on, but go back to the beginning,
[02:02:59.311 --> 02:03:04.230]   because you were trying to download all this, and then, I know it's not that your views have changed,
[02:03:04.230 --> 02:03:09.991]   but your understanding of the information you've given has become, I would say, more focused or sophisticated
[02:03:09.991 --> 02:03:12.811]   as you're able to decode it, because I've been, since then,
[02:03:12.811 --> 02:03:16.430]   I've not gotten massive downloads, but I've gotten big pieces, epiphanies,
[02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:19.911]   chunk after chunk, and you know when it's divine, when it's next level,
[02:03:19.911 --> 02:03:24.750]   but just getting into what makes David Icke work, and what you were doing in life,
[02:03:24.750 --> 02:03:30.311]   top broadcaster, but a top goalie, hosted the top show in the UK.
[02:03:30.352 --> 02:03:31.732]  I mean, you were a big deal.
[02:03:31.752 --> 02:03:35.394]  And then all of a sudden you're on a trip to Peru and get thunderstruck.
[02:03:35.514 --> 02:03:36.095]  Speak to that.
[02:03:37.745 --> 02:03:45.851]  Well, I can talk about the process of what's happening to people when they get this Damascus, as you describe it.
[02:03:46.332 --> 02:03:49.394]  I can certainly talk about that a little later.
[02:03:49.474 --> 02:03:54.298]  I hope I can, because it's easily explainable what's actually happening in those situations.
[02:03:54.358 --> 02:03:55.559]  Well, talk about it now if you want.
[02:03:55.579 --> 02:03:57.961]  I mean, whatever you want to say.
[02:03:57.981 --> 02:03:58.701]  OK, I'll talk about it now.
[02:03:58.721 --> 02:04:02.464]  Now we can talk about, you know, where I've come from a bit later.
[02:04:02.885 --> 02:04:03.125]  Yeah.
[02:04:03.445 --> 02:04:22.641]   OK, so I'm Describing earlier how the body is a biological computer and actually it's a software program and it comes into this world with a life program which it will play out without the intervention of consciousness.
[02:04:23.863 --> 02:04:37.668]  And so you go along and the five senses, because this is a simulation, not just a simulation in this level, what we call the astral is another part of the simulation.
[02:04:39.128 --> 02:05:19.240]   And so what you're doing is following the program and all your perceptions of reality are coming in from the program through the media and what we call education and all this stuff and you have a certain view of reality not least through the left side of the brain which sees everything as apart from everything else and what happens when people have these revelatory moments I had mine in Peru as you say is that consciousness connects
[02:05:20.347 --> 02:05:28.290]  You open enough from the program and you open your mind, you open your mind.
[02:05:29.210 --> 02:05:58.541]   If people just stopped believing and getting their perceptions of reality from five senses, from the five sense system and just said this to themselves, look, I can see only a tiny fraction of the reality, infinite reality, called visible light.
[02:05:59.862 --> 02:06:14.962]   So how the hell can I know all there is to know, or as much as I need to know, From within that tiny band of... You've spoken to that, I'm saying, it's the same question.
[02:06:15.463 --> 02:06:23.147]  What is it in your life, or the things you went through, that the universe chose you to have this big understanding of things that's turned out to be so accurate?
[02:06:23.847 --> 02:06:27.329]  Or are you just saying, randomly in the universe, this just happened to you?
[02:06:27.349 --> 02:06:29.050]  Because I don't see it like that.
[02:06:29.070 --> 02:06:32.732]  I mean, go back to... Because I think, it's not two questions, it's one question.
[02:06:34.358 --> 02:06:37.279]  I don't think, I don't think, I don't think, you know, it's random.
[02:06:37.339 --> 02:06:49.104]  I mean, my life has been so synchronistic that put me on this road in 1990 that I don't, I don't think it's, it's random.
[02:06:49.244 --> 02:06:52.526]  But what I was, where I was just going is this.
[02:06:53.286 --> 02:07:01.169]  There's one thing that cannot be denied and cannot be dismissed.
[02:07:02.190 --> 02:07:10.475]   And that is that whatever we think we know at any point there is always
[02:07:10.475 --> 02:07:12.845]  always always more to know.
[02:07:12.845 --> 02:07:17.484]  Exactly. And if you work from that it's like to...
[02:07:17.429 --> 02:07:24.828]   paraphrase the Greek philosopher Socrates, "Wisdom is knowing how little we know."
[02:07:24.828 --> 02:07:32.028]   And thus, every minute you know there's more to know. So what is it that is
[02:07:32.028 --> 02:07:36.908]  more to know? Instead of sitting in this...
[02:07:35.985 --> 02:07:37.086]  They don't want you to know.
[02:07:37.126 --> 02:07:38.607]  Because not knowing is their power.
[02:07:38.427 --> 02:07:43.587]   the Atlantic Monthly, all of them, do not ask questions, do not do your own research, that's bad.
[02:07:43.587 --> 02:07:48.667]   Now, people should know, when you're told, don't check things out, don't read the fine print,
[02:07:48.667 --> 02:07:50.366]  that's what the bad guy tells you.
[02:07:50.366 --> 02:07:53.866]  Yeah, exactly, they don't want you to know.
[02:07:53.866 --> 02:07:56.306]  'Cause not knowing is their power.
[02:07:56.306 --> 02:08:03.857]   So when you start to look at life from that point of view, Whatever I think I know, there's always more to know.
[02:08:04.177 --> 02:08:19.488]  What happens is your mind starts to open to other possibilities, at which point it starts to go beyond the five sense prison cell and you start to connect with expanded levels of consciousness.
[02:08:19.808 --> 02:08:21.930]  Not some alien in a bloody spaceship.
[02:08:22.150 --> 02:08:23.992]  Well, we are the universe and beyond.
[02:08:24.072 --> 02:08:24.573]  That's the point.
[02:08:24.393 --> 02:08:30.552]   that you have been separated from by your focus of attention only in five sense reality.
[02:08:30.552 --> 02:08:33.872]   Which the truth is, you can plug your consciousness into the universe and beyond.
[02:08:33.872 --> 02:08:37.752]  Well, we are the universe and beyond, that's the point.
[02:08:37.752 --> 02:08:44.832]   But we've been isolated, perceptually isolated, through various and many techniques,
[02:08:44.832 --> 02:08:46.993]  in a five sense prison cell.
[02:08:46.993 --> 02:08:51.993]   So once you start to open your mind and let consciousness in
[02:08:52.153 --> 02:09:01.233]   that's when you're tapping in to all this awareness and all this knowing that suddenly revelatory.
[02:09:01.787 --> 02:09:03.248]  I can see it now.
[02:09:03.909 --> 02:09:05.390]  Why didn't I see it before?
[02:09:05.410 --> 02:09:06.991]  Because you were there before.
[02:09:07.671 --> 02:09:08.091]  Exactly.
[02:09:08.171 --> 02:09:10.333]  And I know you've been around a lot of these globalists.
[02:09:10.813 --> 02:09:11.454]  I have as well.
[02:09:11.934 --> 02:09:12.835]  They're like machines.
[02:09:12.875 --> 02:09:14.316]  Like you said, they're not happy people.
[02:09:14.356 --> 02:09:15.997]  They just follow a program.
[02:09:16.557 --> 02:09:19.799]  Is it possible to free people that have been under this control?
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:21.941]  Or once they get under the control, are they gone?
[02:09:24.105 --> 02:09:25.647]  Anyone can open to consciousness.
[02:09:26.508 --> 02:09:27.329]  It's the choice.
[02:09:28.610 --> 02:09:35.517]  But the more you submit to the program, the more entrenched you become in the program.
[02:09:36.178 --> 02:09:45.869]  I mean, you'll meet people, and it doesn't matter how much information you put in front of them, how much evidence, they won't get it.
[02:09:46.624 --> 02:09:55.751]  They won't get it because literally they can't process that information because they can only process their program.
[02:09:56.251 --> 02:09:59.774]  But anyone can open up to it, and lots of people are.
[02:10:00.074 --> 02:10:01.655]  And you know what I'm finding, Alex?
[02:10:01.695 --> 02:10:24.366]   I don't know if you are, but people that are kind of new to this, some of them anyway, they can awaken in the way that I've described To an extent that they get it in such a way that they become further forward in their understanding that people maybe have been researching this for 10 years.
[02:10:25.567 --> 02:10:26.028]  Absolutely.
[02:10:26.068 --> 02:10:28.050]  A lot of people are making instant jumps.
[02:10:29.651 --> 02:10:30.291]  Yeah.
[02:10:30.732 --> 02:10:31.613]  This is what's happening.
[02:10:32.133 --> 02:10:32.934]  This is what's happening.
[02:10:33.154 --> 02:10:40.460]  Because as these truth vibrations, this frequency comes in, it's coming into the simulation through the astral.
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:51.362]   I mean, you know, This simulation, this world we call human, and even the astral on top, it's a mere smear of infinite reality.
[02:10:51.502 --> 02:10:54.585]  Sure, the astral is just the interface to this little sub-dimension.
[02:10:55.485 --> 02:10:57.687]  Yeah, it's a simulation.
[02:10:57.747 --> 02:10:59.368]  It's like a virtual reality game.
[02:10:59.608 --> 02:11:01.830]  The body and the brain is like a headset.
[02:11:02.821 --> 02:11:15.965]  And what you do when you open your mind and let consciousness in is you're effectively taking the headset off because you're overriding the program and thus you can see things that others can't see.
[02:11:16.005 --> 02:11:16.746]  That's right.
[02:11:16.946 --> 02:11:18.926]  Take the headset off with David Icke.
[02:11:18.986 --> 02:11:20.267]  Take the face sucker off.
[02:11:20.727 --> 02:11:23.588]  We'll come right back with David Icke with another iconic segment.
[02:11:23.608 --> 02:11:24.008]  Stay with us.
[02:11:24.068 --> 02:11:25.969]  InfoWars.com, DavidIcke.com.
[02:11:25.989 --> 02:11:26.449]  Check them both out.
[02:11:27.899 --> 02:11:34.823]  So, you're an energetic being, an eternal being, and you're going to choose what energy you resonate with, is the best way to describe it.
[02:11:35.603 --> 02:11:44.949]  You can travel up into the higher consciousness, or you can be destroyed, basically destroyed, being bound to agents of chaos.
[02:11:46.049 --> 02:11:46.790]  But David, I...
[02:11:48.797 --> 02:12:05.206]  What do you think it's like, because I think it's fascinating, to be one of these globalists, like a King Charles, or any of them, because they act buffoonish, they're moronic, they try to project power, but when you look at them, they're repulsive.
[02:12:06.047 --> 02:12:09.068]  And if you go online, King Charles is incredibly unpopular.
[02:12:10.289 --> 02:12:11.770]  Bill Gates is incredibly unpopular.
[02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:13.891]  Klaus Schwab is incredibly unpopular.
[02:12:14.591 --> 02:12:17.839]   And so it was one thing Ten years ago, even.
[02:12:18.559 --> 02:12:23.742]  Still, if somebody was established, but the average person thought they were powerful, the facade's already fallen.
[02:12:24.562 --> 02:12:29.405]  And they're like, I guess, wannabe Greek gods that need to be worshipped to exist.
[02:12:29.945 --> 02:12:38.689]  I just, I feel like they've already been broken to a great extent, except we've got to face their temper tantrum that they're going to launch against us.
[02:12:40.731 --> 02:12:58.311]   From your study and research, what is it like To be possessed by these entities, because you talk a lot about the satanic rituals, and now it's all out in the open with the children, and that they're doing this to be able to resonate closer to these avatars, these controllers.
[02:12:59.231 --> 02:13:02.232]  But what is it, from your research, like to be one of these people?
[02:13:03.292 --> 02:13:06.753]  Well, these people are basically incarnate demons.
[02:13:07.833 --> 02:13:30.682]  You know, if you go back to what I said, Alex, about the biological body being a biological computer, what inhabits it is anything from an expanded state of awareness to a demonic low vibrational moron.
[02:13:31.923 --> 02:13:46.481]   So it's what's inhabiting the biological computer And in terms of this cult, particularly the inner cause of this cult and the major gophers, they are demonically possessed.
[02:13:47.141 --> 02:13:56.063]  I just say to people, look into the eyes, because the eyes are indeed the window on the soul or the window on the no-soul.
[02:13:56.563 --> 02:14:02.585]  And you can see in the eyes the nature of the entity that's behind them.
[02:14:03.294 --> 02:14:06.718]  Go and look at Mark Rutter, the Netherlands Prime Minister.
[02:14:06.758 --> 02:14:07.859]  Go and look at his eyes.
[02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:10.843]  Look at Gates' eyes.
[02:14:10.883 --> 02:14:16.930]  Look at all these people's eyes and you'll see the demonic within them because that's what they are.
[02:14:17.430 --> 02:14:29.357]   And what they're doing is hiding Behind a biological computer system, a body, which looks like everyone else's.
[02:14:29.957 --> 02:14:34.099]  And so we look at them, people look at them, and they say, oh they're a human.
[02:14:34.579 --> 02:14:41.701]  But it's not what the body looks like, it's what's inhabiting the body and driving its behavior and driving its perceptions.
[02:14:42.401 --> 02:14:51.527]   And one of the things about this demonic realm, is that it has no capacity for empathy.
[02:14:52.107 --> 02:14:54.967]  It has no capacity for compassion.
[02:14:55.748 --> 02:15:09.950]  And thus, when one of these entities is inhabiting one of these cult gopher bodies, that behavior will reflect the fact that it has no compassion and has no empathy.
[02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:14.271]  This is why Gates can do what he's done in the Covid era.
[02:15:14.771 --> 02:15:25.813]  To vast numbers of people who are now dead or have their health destroyed for life, and he will have no emotional consequence for that, because they're psychopaths.
[02:15:26.373 --> 02:15:37.475]  Psychopaths, if you look at the psychopathic traits, the top two are no empathy, not being able to put yourself in the feelings of those you're affecting, and no compassion.
[02:15:37.495 --> 02:15:39.416]  This is why these people are as they are.
[02:15:39.456 --> 02:15:41.636]  They're demonically possessed.
[02:15:42.356 --> 02:15:49.947]  And, you know, I do want to talk about two things which I think are very relevant to many things that are going on.
[02:15:50.007 --> 02:15:52.591]  First of all, there's what people call God.
[02:15:53.151 --> 02:16:22.581]   And secondly, and I'll start with this one, is that When Morpheus in the Matrix held up a battery and said the machines, or to go to the wider quote, the Matrix is a computer-generated dream world, it is, it's a simulation, created or designed to turn human beings into one of these, a battery, it was a profound truth.
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:32.449]  Because these entities, which are the fallen angels in the Bible, that's another thing about religion.
[02:16:32.930 --> 02:16:34.571]  You look at the common themes.
[02:16:34.912 --> 02:16:39.416]  What Christianity calls Satan or the devil is this force.
[02:16:39.997 --> 02:16:44.922]  What Islam calls Iblis or Shaitan is this force.
[02:16:46.272 --> 02:16:51.334]  And therefore they're all talking about the same thing without actually realizing it.
[02:16:51.975 --> 02:16:58.658]  So what's happening is this demonic realm is feeding off human energy.
[02:16:59.138 --> 02:17:00.198]  That's what it's doing.
[02:17:00.258 --> 02:17:01.919]  Now what kind of human energy?
[02:17:01.959 --> 02:17:03.620]  This will explain a lot about the world.
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:13.184]  Because they're in a low vibrational state they can only absorb low vibrational energy.
[02:17:14.020 --> 02:17:22.232]  It's never the twain shall meet.
[02:17:22.332 --> 02:17:23.834]  They're on different wavelengths.
[02:17:24.415 --> 02:17:55.369]   So they have to manipulate the human population To fall into low vibrational, emotional and mental states of fear, of anxiety, of resentment, of hatred, of conflict, because that generates through the emotional and mental energetic expression, that low vibrational energy which they feed off.
[02:17:55.996 --> 02:18:02.082]  When they're doing a sacrifice and they say we're sacrificing to the gods, what does that mean?
[02:18:02.102 --> 02:18:05.485]  It means that they're going through rituals.
[02:18:05.505 --> 02:18:23.975]   So this is why even today these cultists are using Babylonian rituals, ancient Egyptian rituals, etc., because they are designed specifically to generate the terror and the buildup of the terror in the sacrifice to the point
[02:18:23.975 --> 02:18:24.835]  where they're generating...
[02:18:24.835 --> 02:18:27.795]   Because we got to do one more break, come out with a final segment with the iconic David Icke,
[02:18:27.795 --> 02:18:32.515]   davidicke.com. But since you raised that, we'll talk about Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones,
[02:18:32.515 --> 02:18:35.955]   the CERN rituals that are going on. But before we go to break in two minutes,
[02:18:35.955 --> 02:18:41.715]   we know they want a bunch of slaves to feed off of, then why do they want to depopulate us?
[02:18:41.965 --> 02:18:50.130]  Is that because they figured out that out of the mass of people enough resistance is going to form, and they can't keep control, they want to replace us with robots that serve them?
[02:18:50.470 --> 02:18:55.593]  Because if they want to use us for psychic energy, why at the same time are they trying to kill as many of us as possible?
[02:18:57.273 --> 02:19:01.956]  Well, because their plan is to make it far, far more efficient.
[02:19:03.007 --> 02:19:16.020]  You see, if they're connecting AI, which is basically them, that's what it is, to the human brain, then what they're doing... They're gonna terrorize and torture us and get way more energy off the individual.
[02:19:17.241 --> 02:19:28.902]   Yeah, they are dictating our perceptions and emotional states, and thus, We become basically machines to generate this low vibration.
[02:19:28.922 --> 02:19:30.062]  So the answer is what you just said.
[02:19:30.102 --> 02:19:34.724]  We're being converted from them doing it at an ambient level to them actually directly farming us.
[02:19:36.824 --> 02:19:43.306]  Think the Matrix and the babies feeding the machines, the energy of the babies feeding the machines.
[02:19:43.386 --> 02:19:45.107]  That's what we're looking at.
[02:19:45.858 --> 02:19:53.563]  A technological version, an AI version of... Alright, stand right there, because he mentioned the occult rituals.
[02:19:54.384 --> 02:20:05.371]  Public satanic events at CERN, private ones, bohemian groves, skull and bones, and I look at it and I laugh until I realize how serious they are when I've gone and infiltrated some of these events and covered them.
[02:20:05.691 --> 02:20:10.815]  They take it deadly serious, and why are they doing such ancient rituals over and over again?
[02:20:11.235 --> 02:20:12.296]  What is the paradigm?
[02:20:12.336 --> 02:20:13.256]  What is the signature?
[02:20:13.316 --> 02:20:14.037]  Why does it...
[02:20:14.757 --> 02:20:20.081]  Why did they, in the 2012 Olympics, have Grim Reapers using a COVID virus to murder everyone in London?
[02:20:20.421 --> 02:20:21.422]  We'll show that when we come back.
[02:20:21.482 --> 02:20:24.624]  Why do they have to tell us what they're going to do before they do it?
[02:20:25.084 --> 02:20:29.147]  David Icke's our guest, and 5G's opening up the dimensions for this.
[02:20:29.547 --> 02:20:33.069]  What is the Hadron Superconducting Super Collider doing in Europe?
[02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:34.910]  David Icke, davidicke.com.
[02:20:35.391 --> 02:20:37.692]  His new book drops very, very soon.
[02:20:37.712 --> 02:20:38.633]  The newest one's The Trap.
[02:20:39.194 --> 02:20:41.861]  The latest one that's about to come out is The Dream.
[02:20:42.182 --> 02:20:43.787]  Find it all at DavidIke.com.
[02:20:44.108 --> 02:20:45.712]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:20:45.752 --> 02:20:46.354]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:50.802]  Final segment with the amazing David Icke.
[02:20:50.902 --> 02:20:52.003]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:20:52.563 --> 02:20:56.846]  You'll find our coordinates at InfoWars.com and InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:20:56.866 --> 02:20:57.807]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:20:58.287 --> 02:21:07.074]  All right, David, getting into the occult, because you raised this and I meant to, I had the crew hours ago going, get Bohemian Grove ready, get Stolen Bones ready, get the CERN rituals together.
[02:21:07.094 --> 02:21:09.976]  I'm going to bring up, why do they do these stupid rituals?
[02:21:10.016 --> 02:21:23.965]   Because, you know, I stuck into Bohemian Grove, was laughing at the ritual until I saw that the men were shaking And beyond anything I ever saw at Holy Roller churches I went to when I was a kid, they were completely possessed there.
[02:21:24.025 --> 02:21:30.229]  And you look at CERN, everywhere they're doing classical, ancient, occultic rituals.
[02:21:30.349 --> 02:21:32.070]  Why are they doing it, David Icke?
[02:21:34.472 --> 02:21:44.198]  Well, first of all, I've studied this and I've talked to many, many Satanists and former Satanists around the world over these decades.
[02:21:45.896 --> 02:21:52.860]  These cult gophers, shall we say, are terrified of the demons.
[02:21:53.340 --> 02:21:54.221]  They're terrified.
[02:21:55.181 --> 02:22:00.284]  And they are frightened of the consequences of failing them.
[02:22:00.604 --> 02:22:01.544]  They really are.
[02:22:02.805 --> 02:22:28.980]   And what's happening in these rituals is they are... What can happen is that these rituals, if you're talking about a ritual around, say, a single individual, The ritual can create a vibrational bridge or connection between the person and the demonic entity.
[02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:34.944]  And this allows that demonic entity to come through into this reality and possess the person.
[02:22:35.444 --> 02:22:43.270]  And there's so many of these, I mean, satanic rituals, all the people involved are literally possessed.
[02:22:44.019 --> 02:23:00.165]  And like I said earlier, what these rituals are doing, from a sacrifice to the gods point of view, is producing the energy from the sacrifice that these entities in the astral feed off.
[02:23:00.225 --> 02:23:06.948]  So, you know, you can see someone being emotional with your eyes, because that's happening within 3D.
[02:23:08.470 --> 02:23:13.171]  But the energy that that emotional response is giving off, you can't see.
[02:23:13.251 --> 02:23:16.231]  You might be able to feel it, but you can't see it because it's astral.
[02:23:17.012 --> 02:23:25.733]  And so in that astral realm, these entities are feeding off the terror and the fear of the sacrifice.
[02:23:25.913 --> 02:23:35.915]  And in this realm, that terror manifests chemically as adrenochrome and adrenaline.
[02:23:36.796 --> 02:23:47.163]  And thus the Satanists in this realm will drink the blood and get adrenochrome rush because it's like a rush to them.
[02:23:47.744 --> 02:23:53.868]  And it's the chemical expression of the terror that the entities in the astral are feeding off.
[02:23:54.749 --> 02:23:55.809]  And so that's why they do it.
[02:23:55.929 --> 02:24:12.405]   And in these various rituals you can do it that way or you can actually create an energetic environment That bridges the two realities so the demonic entity can possess the person.
[02:24:12.465 --> 02:24:15.488]  And this is an interesting point that I've found over the years.
[02:24:17.049 --> 02:24:20.391]  We see a hierarchy.
[02:24:21.292 --> 02:24:27.096]  We'll see a prime minister, a deputy prime minister, a president, a deputy president, a leader of the house and all that.
[02:24:27.456 --> 02:24:29.417]  So you see the human hierarchy.
[02:24:30.298 --> 02:24:42.630]   But within the satanic realm of the cult, The hierarchy that dictates that is dependent on the level of demon that possesses you.
[02:24:43.291 --> 02:25:03.022]   So if you're one of the demonic, if you like, masters, Then you, possessed by that entity, will be higher up the satanic cult hierarchy than someone who appears to be higher than you in the human hierarchy.
[02:25:04.344 --> 02:25:12.670]  The hierarchy of control is dictated by the scale and level of the demon that's possessing you, which means what?
[02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:22.056]  It means that the hierarchy in the demonic becomes the hierarchy in the human world, the real hierarchy, the one they never talk about.
[02:25:22.688 --> 02:25:29.553]  And this is why you've got people who are dictating to apparently people who are higher than them.
[02:25:29.573 --> 02:25:42.804]  Well, I was about to say, David, you talked 33 years ago about secret satanic rituals and members of Parliament slitting kids' throats that later came out to be true and Jimmy Savelle and the BBC were the first to expose it decades before Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:25:42.824 --> 02:25:46.086]  You exposed it all because you were there and had the intel.
[02:25:49.063 --> 02:26:00.028]  If you pull back from this, now almost every national show or the Grammys or whatever is demons and women in cages and men as Satan and doing mock sacrifice.
[02:26:00.408 --> 02:26:04.790]  So the stuff they used to do at Bohemian Grove and Secret has now been fully externalized.
[02:26:04.810 --> 02:26:09.772]  They're showing us mass plague, mass death, our children dying in mass, our children in cages.
[02:26:10.272 --> 02:26:13.553]  I mean, you just turn on a random show, it's all hell on earth.
[02:26:14.133 --> 02:26:15.214]  So what are they doing?
[02:26:15.234 --> 02:26:16.474]  Just getting us ready for something?
[02:26:16.935 --> 02:26:17.315]  What is this?
[02:26:18.475 --> 02:26:24.579]  What they're doing is they're taking the demonic and all its paraphernalia and its symbolism.
[02:26:24.619 --> 02:26:28.201]  You see, everything is a frequency.
[02:26:29.102 --> 02:26:31.083]  So a symbol is a frequency.
[02:26:31.923 --> 02:26:41.489]  So the pyramid and all-seeing eye, if you saw it on a frequency wave field level, it would be a certain resonance.
[02:26:42.609 --> 02:26:46.891]  So are all these other symbols, the inverted cross, the inverted pentagram.
[02:26:46.931 --> 02:26:53.353]  They are generating a particular frequency which that symbol is designed to generate.
[02:26:53.933 --> 02:27:03.457]  So when you're looking... So you're saying they're invoking all the sacrifice and war and death that's been done in the same ritual, so even though no one's being actually killed there, it's the same as that?
[02:27:04.471 --> 02:27:11.654]  Yeah, well, when you're looking at one of these stage shows or the Grammys, this Pratt, what's his name, Sam Smith, bloody lunatic.
[02:27:12.235 --> 02:27:17.617]  When you're looking at all that stuff, that's generating a satanic frequency.
[02:27:18.358 --> 02:27:29.655]   And if you, if what we focus upon, we connect with What we give our attention to, we connect with energetically, frequency.
[02:27:30.236 --> 02:27:40.223]  And thus, as you're looking at this thing, or looking at this scene, you are being pulled into that satanic frequency through your attention.
[02:27:41.636 --> 02:27:43.378]  This is where awareness comes in, Alex.
[02:27:43.878 --> 02:27:50.826]  If you are aware that that's how it works, you are conscious of it, it has no effect on you.
[02:27:51.326 --> 02:28:04.463]   But if you're unconscious and you're just looking at it, you think it's some bloody stage show or something, only that, then that attention, that guard down, that consciousness guard down, We'll connect you with it.
[02:28:04.503 --> 02:28:05.484]  That's why they're doing it.
[02:28:05.524 --> 02:28:07.106]  That's why they're putting it in your face.
[02:28:07.746 --> 02:28:13.552]  Because of the connection it makes and thus the impact it then has on your perception.
[02:28:16.681 --> 02:28:28.366]  Well, that's right, David, and these things, it always starts the first few minutes as not openly satanic, and then the devils, then the sex slaves, then the cages with children in them come out once they think they've got you at an unconscious level.
[02:28:28.866 --> 02:28:33.588]  And then some people overdo it, they say, well, if anybody ever does an OK symbol, they mean they're a Satanist.
[02:28:33.968 --> 02:28:38.930]  No, when I do that, it's just a habit of growing up seeing people say, OK, everything's great, or that was great food.
[02:28:39.250 --> 02:28:41.671]  But when they do it, the symbols mean something different.
[02:28:41.711 --> 02:28:47.014]   So how do we separate Using a symbol for good versus evil, or does evil own certain symbols?
[02:28:49.235 --> 02:28:56.499]  Well, every kind of symbol has a frequency, but the key is intent.
[02:28:57.319 --> 02:28:58.160]  That's the key.
[02:28:58.700 --> 02:29:01.802]  What generates the frequency is the intent.
[02:29:02.502 --> 02:29:08.576]   If the intent of a symbol is to generate a frequency of satanic nature,
[02:29:08.576 --> 02:29:12.016]  then that's what it will do.
[02:29:12.016 --> 02:29:19.436]   But if you do something similar with an intent that is very different, then that intent will mean
[02:29:19.436 --> 02:29:21.695]  that that, whatever you do, is generating--
[02:29:21.695 --> 02:29:25.695]   Sure, but maybe I'm programmed by the Jello commercials and the Sprite commercials,
[02:29:25.695 --> 02:29:27.136]  are like, "Oh, that was a great dinner."
[02:29:27.136 --> 02:29:30.195]   And I do that just because I mean, like, that's really good, or listen to me.
[02:29:30.195 --> 02:29:32.416]  But have I been programmed when I do that?
[02:29:32.416 --> 02:29:37.166]   Or my intent's not to be bad, symbol by itself like the rainbow is in the Bible but now
[02:29:37.166 --> 02:29:41.011]   it's the symbol of the I mean, is the rainbow bad, or is it good, or is it just a symbol?
[02:29:43.027 --> 02:29:50.673]  Well, the rainbow is a symbol of something called the Noahide Laws, of course, which people should research.
[02:29:50.973 --> 02:30:06.537]   And it's interesting that the Noahide Laws, which come from rabbis, etc., in the past, should have the symbol all along of the The rainbow.
[02:30:07.117 --> 02:30:12.722]  And suddenly, I mean, is it possible to go anywhere without seeing a rainbow symbol these days?
[02:30:13.262 --> 02:30:17.005]  Those two things I don't think are a coincidence.
[02:30:17.345 --> 02:30:20.548]  But you can look at a rainbow and it's a rainbow.
[02:30:20.947 --> 02:30:28.347]   or you can have a symbol of a rainbow that is, the intent is that it represents something else to you,
[02:30:28.347 --> 02:30:30.347]  it will represent that frequency.
[02:30:30.347 --> 02:30:34.347]  And thus, you know, all these different symbols can be...
[02:30:34.347 --> 02:30:36.347]  Incredible. David, you've been so gracious.
[02:30:36.566 --> 02:30:39.068]  Two-minute break, five more minutes, and I promise you, you can go.
[02:30:39.408 --> 02:30:43.051]  But I want to talk about your book for five minutes, because I read the last one.
[02:30:43.071 --> 02:30:43.531]  Incredible.
[02:30:43.571 --> 02:30:43.992]  The Trap.
[02:30:44.372 --> 02:30:45.813]  The new book is coming out.
[02:30:45.913 --> 02:30:46.534]  The Dream.
[02:30:46.914 --> 02:30:50.857]  Back in two minutes, we'll talk about The Dream with David Icke, when our special guest host takes over.
[02:30:50.877 --> 02:30:52.919]  Please remember, I'm listening for supportive folks.
[02:30:53.019 --> 02:30:53.920]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:30:53.940 --> 02:30:56.042]  The July 4th sale is still going.
[02:30:56.422 --> 02:30:58.804]  Nitric Boost and other products, they're all up there.

[02:31:02.267 --> 02:31:03.007]  Please take action.
[02:31:03.067 --> 02:31:04.589]  It funds incredible interviews like this.
[02:31:05.973 --> 02:31:15.236]  Final segment with the iconic David Icke of DavidIcke.com, and of course we're going to name this interview once it's uploaded, is David Icke on God and Demons.
[02:31:16.657 --> 02:31:20.118]  And then of course Drew Hernandez, Lothar Verbera, about to take over next segment.
[02:31:20.138 --> 02:31:26.100]  So you wanted to get into the nature of God, and then a little bit about the book, the new book, David Icke.
[02:31:28.658 --> 02:31:38.023]  I think, you know, all the different religions, it's a bit of a divide and rule, really, because there's a lot of things that they agree on.
[02:31:38.563 --> 02:31:39.784]  So, what is God?
[02:31:39.964 --> 02:31:42.585]  What a Christian will call God, I call the Infinite.
[02:31:42.665 --> 02:32:02.731]   It's a force that pervades the entirety of existence, and you can Connect with it and be inspired by it or you can be separated from it and thus be demonically manipulated.
[02:32:03.451 --> 02:32:19.535]  And this, what I called earlier the truth vibrations, this vibrational change that's going on, that's breaking up this simulated mind prison, it's what a Christian would call God, what I would call the infinite, it's actually making it happen.
[02:32:20.656 --> 02:32:30.400]  And this is what this demonic realm, this demonic force is retreating from as it imposes itself more and more on this simulated nonsense.
[02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:41.265]  And that's why it's coming in, the demonic realm is coming more and more into this reality in its retreat and that's why we're seeing all these bizarre things going on in this chaos.
[02:32:42.205 --> 02:32:51.974]   But you know, instead of saying do you believe in the Christian God or do you believe in the Islamic God or whatever, It's a force of love.
[02:32:52.054 --> 02:32:53.895]  It's a force of wisdom.
[02:32:54.755 --> 02:32:59.337]  It's a force that holds the entirety of infinite reality together.
[02:32:59.897 --> 02:33:03.478]  And whatever we call it, that's what it is.
[02:33:03.878 --> 02:33:18.640]   And instead of being divided and ruled by our perceptions of it, let's just Um, be brought together by, um, understanding that it may be different things to different people, but it's actually the same force we're talking about.
[02:33:19.200 --> 02:33:24.084]  And it is, um, in the process of bringing an end to this nonsense.
[02:33:24.164 --> 02:33:30.930]  But we, we're gonna have chaos and upheaval because if you corner a rat, it's not going to go quietly.
[02:33:30.950 --> 02:33:32.431]  And that's what we're experiencing.
[02:33:32.471 --> 02:33:38.176]  We're experiencing the demonic realm and its, uh, cult expression in our reality.
[02:33:38.756 --> 02:33:39.777]  Powerful information.
[02:33:39.856 --> 02:33:44.897]   and it's thrashing out and it's desperately doing everything it can to hold on to its power.
[02:33:44.897 --> 02:33:53.296]   And you know it will for a little while but it's over lads, it's over boys, it's over people,
[02:33:53.296 --> 02:33:55.856]  it's just a matter of it playing out.
[02:33:55.856 --> 02:34:05.617]   Powerful information. In the time we have left, give us a sneak peek of the new book.
[02:34:07.457 --> 02:34:13.137]   Yeah it's called The Dream because this, what I call the simulation, and more and more of course
[02:34:13.137 --> 02:34:16.736]   mainstream scientists are saying actually it does look like it's a simulation.
[02:34:16.830 --> 02:34:21.693]  It just, so many mysteries of life disappear once you realize this is a simulation.
[02:34:22.753 --> 02:34:23.854]  It's an induced dream.
[02:34:23.874 --> 02:34:25.415]  It's what it is.
[02:34:25.435 --> 02:34:51.336]   Do you know, years ago, if I've got time quickly to tell you, years ago when I was a journalist, I'd wake up in the morning in bed and I'd put the radio on, BBC Radio 4 or something, a current affairs show, and I'd maybe fall back to sleep, you know, many days, and then I'd wake up, thought I'd been asleep for ages, it was just a minute or so, and I'd have a dream, a very vivid dream, and that vivid dream, when I woke up,
[02:34:52.071 --> 02:34:58.092]  was actually related to what the radio story or discussion was about.
[02:34:58.612 --> 02:35:03.813]  So it was an induced dream by what I was hearing subconsciously.
[02:35:04.234 --> 02:35:07.934]  And this simulation is an induced dream.
[02:35:07.954 --> 02:35:12.555]  And we can stop being controlled by it.
[02:35:12.655 --> 02:35:19.817]  And I explain in the dream what this dream is and how we can take our power back from it.
[02:35:20.277 --> 02:35:20.877]  And we can.
[02:35:22.659 --> 02:35:23.662]  Thank you so much.
[02:35:23.822 --> 02:35:25.045]  It's always great to talk to you.

[02:37:24.616 --> 02:37:33.639]  I want to hand the baton now to the great Drew Hernandez to give us the latest developments unfolding the next hour ahead of Owen Schroyer that takes over in one hour, 3 p.m.
[02:37:33.679 --> 02:37:34.040]  Central.
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:34.720]  Drew Hernandez.
[02:37:36.283 --> 02:37:37.383]  Alex, thanks for having me.
[02:37:37.403 --> 02:37:42.105]  I definitely think that what we're watching right now in real time is millions.
[02:37:42.145 --> 02:37:46.146]  You're seeing millions of people wake up to the reality that all of this is in existence.
[02:37:46.686 --> 02:37:50.587]  You know, people can't just sit and stand by anymore and just kind of like sit on the fence.
[02:37:50.627 --> 02:37:52.287]  I mean, the devil owns the fence.
[02:37:52.407 --> 02:37:54.348]  I mean, these evil forces own the fence.
[02:37:54.688 --> 02:37:55.908]  People just want to sit by.
[02:37:55.948 --> 02:37:57.729]  They want to sit there and say, well, you know what?
[02:37:58.499 --> 02:38:18.298]  There's two types of mindsets that I think are kind of imploding on people that might, you know, we call normies or, you know, your kind of average NPC that's just kind of like paying, you know, not attention, but watching the news, turning on local news, you know, whether they're in California or New York or Austin, Texas or Arizona, and kind of slightly in the know of what's going on locally.
[02:38:18.679 --> 02:38:20.701]  The problem is, is you have two types of mindsets.
[02:38:20.741 --> 02:38:39.549]   The first type of mindset is someone that sits there And absolutely denies everything that they're watching in real time, especially if they lived through 2020 and the lockdowns that came from foreign entities in foreign lands, the World Health Organization, you name it, all these entities that are demonically and satanically charged that are unelected.
[02:38:39.929 --> 02:39:02.313]   Somehow, some way, the great high priest Dr. Fauci gained more power than the President of the United States at the time, and I would argue even To this point in time right now, these unelected bureaucrats have that same kind of power to influence policy at the top in the White House, and then it gets distributed throughout the entire land at the local level.
[02:39:02.373 --> 02:39:04.655]  Starts federally and then goes out to the local level.
[02:39:04.775 --> 02:39:13.279]   I would argue, listen, right now that The two mindsets that are dangerous to the normies and the NPCs right now are people that I would say are in absolute denial.
[02:39:13.639 --> 02:39:15.400]  They watch this stuff all unfolding.
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:17.521]  They see it happening in real time.
[02:39:17.781 --> 02:39:19.742]  They get a little bit of red pilled every now and then.
[02:39:19.782 --> 02:39:20.943]  They get a little bit of that dose.
[02:39:21.283 --> 02:39:23.504]  They'll get an Alex Jones clip on their timeline.
[02:39:23.744 --> 02:39:26.545]  They'll get a Drew Hernandez and Owen Schroer or Harrison Smith.
[02:39:26.985 --> 02:39:32.468]   It'll pop up somewhere on their Timeline somehow somehow or maybe maybe all the based info warriors out there.
[02:39:32.508 --> 02:39:33.729]  They're sharing the transmissions.
[02:39:33.949 --> 02:39:53.862]   They're sharing the info They're sharing the Intel maybe somehow some way they just got red-pilled right now listening to David Icke about you know This interdimensional world that we all live in that obviously is in charged and empowered by Lucifer and Satan himself people jacking in jacking out of the matrix listen People will see that, and they'll still say, well, that's not real.
[02:39:54.223 --> 02:39:56.325]  They'll still say, well, that's not actually happening.
[02:39:56.565 --> 02:40:05.215]  They'll still sit there, and not all the InfoWarriors that are watching that are based, that are Band.Video right now, watching on Band.Video, no, I'm talking about people that see this stuff.
[02:40:05.876 --> 02:40:06.717]  They get that dose.
[02:40:06.737 --> 02:40:08.758]  They get offered the red pill by Morpheus.
[02:40:08.958 --> 02:40:10.219]  They have the decision to make.
[02:40:10.259 --> 02:40:22.409]  The blue pill, you stay in the Matrix, you stay in enjoying the meat, you stay in enjoying everything that's the simulated environment, everything you touch, everything you sniff, everything that you encounter, everything that you're interfacing with.
[02:40:22.669 --> 02:40:24.791]  Take this blue pill, you go back to sleep.
[02:40:25.151 --> 02:40:26.072]  I never existed.
[02:40:26.292 --> 02:40:31.356]  You never even had a thought or an idea of jacking out and waking up.
[02:40:32.162 --> 02:40:37.747]  Those people that decide to choose that way, they take that blue pill, they continue to take it continually.
[02:40:37.927 --> 02:40:39.849]  It's not like a one-time blue pill, you know?
[02:40:40.910 --> 02:40:44.973]  It's kind of actually a continuous thing because there's so much information coming out.
[02:40:45.454 --> 02:40:48.396]  Right now, the way that The Matrix is, it's like this simulation.
[02:40:48.416 --> 02:40:49.457]  You guys remember the movie?
[02:40:50.498 --> 02:40:53.921]  I think it was Godzilla vs. Kong, the most recent one.
[02:40:54.867 --> 02:41:03.854]  And they had King Kong in this simulated environment, and he would throw trees, he would pull trees out of the ground, and he'd throw them up at the sky, and it would like almost breach.
[02:41:03.954 --> 02:41:06.036]  It was like this arena that he was stuck in.
[02:41:06.636 --> 02:41:09.198]  And the arena had an absolute simulated environment.
[02:41:09.238 --> 02:41:17.444]  It was all these LED screens all over, and they had him in a simulated environment that meant to look like, to feel like, to smell like his home.
[02:41:17.464 --> 02:41:19.446]  But obviously, he was trying to breach it.
[02:41:19.706 --> 02:41:30.574]   Whenever he would throw These gigantic trees up at the ceiling would almost breach and break through the building and the screens would all static and break and see that's what's happening right now guys.
[02:41:31.054 --> 02:41:33.156]  That's happening right now on a daily basis.
[02:41:33.756 --> 02:41:58.460]   You got Alex Jones, you got Ellen Schreier, you got Drew Hernandez, you got all these, you know, InfoWarriors, these based individuals, these based talk show hosts, these based political figures, based You know, even Gen Z-ers and people that are in the mainstream culture, people that are waking up getting red-pilled, just throwing palm trees, throwing these giant red pills at the simulated screens, and they're breaking and they're breaching, while at the same time, all the normies are watching!
[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:05.724]  And they're discovering, and they're looking at the sky, and they're saying, why is the sky turning into static?
[02:42:06.345 --> 02:42:08.486]  Why is the sky almost breaking?
[02:42:09.737 --> 02:42:10.178]  Why?
[02:42:10.198 --> 02:42:14.783]  I thought everything that I ever knew about my entire life was actually in existence.
[02:42:15.323 --> 02:42:16.585]  I thought that was reality.
[02:42:17.065 --> 02:42:25.234]  Why is there another reality that seems to be breaching through what all these guys are throwing up at the ceiling and absolutely shattering the Matrix?
[02:42:25.554 --> 02:42:26.856]  You see, but here's the dangerous part.
[02:42:27.316 --> 02:42:27.997]  Is you got people.
[02:42:28.017 --> 02:42:28.977]  We're throwing red pills.
[02:42:29.157 --> 02:42:30.318]  We're all Morpheus, baby.
[02:42:30.518 --> 02:42:31.499]  We are all Morpheus.
[02:42:31.579 --> 02:42:33.460]  Info Warriors, Alex Jones, doesn't matter.
[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:34.841]  We're all Morpheus, baby.
[02:42:34.901 --> 02:42:35.862]  Dishing red pills.
[02:42:36.322 --> 02:42:37.143]  Launching red pills.
[02:42:37.183 --> 02:42:42.907]  We got red-pilled grenade launchers, man, on a daily basis just launching these things all over the place.
[02:42:43.187 --> 02:42:45.528]  It's just the New World Order can't stop it at this point.
[02:42:45.809 --> 02:42:46.809]  Too much information.
[02:42:47.009 --> 02:42:48.250]  That's why they want to suppress it.
[02:42:48.450 --> 02:42:49.691]  That's why they want to shut it down.
[02:42:49.891 --> 02:42:51.032]  That's why they want to censor.
[02:42:51.232 --> 02:42:53.654]  That's why they want to ban absolutely everyone.
[02:42:54.628 --> 02:42:58.313]  And the reason they want to do this is because we are breaching that matrix.
[02:42:58.813 --> 02:43:01.096]  We are shattering those LED screens.
[02:43:01.377 --> 02:43:10.047]  We are showing the public, we are showing the world just how simulated the entire environment is, and we're unmasking the one at the top of it all.
[02:43:10.308 --> 02:43:18.772]   And it's Satan, it's Lucifer, The Prince of the Power of the Air, the Commander-in-Chief when it comes to the demonic powers and the Kingdom of Darkness here on planet Earth.
[02:43:19.072 --> 02:43:20.033]  He's the one in charge.
[02:43:20.053 --> 02:43:21.153]  He's got his demonic cronies.
[02:43:21.393 --> 02:43:22.913]  They're all like a military.
[02:43:22.933 --> 02:43:24.554]  They're all structured militarily.
[02:43:24.774 --> 02:43:27.795]  They're all structured geographically around planet Earth.
[02:43:28.015 --> 02:43:30.456]  They are all placed in strategic places.
[02:43:31.684 --> 02:43:45.457]  And you guys, listen, the Info Warriors, you're all launching your grenades, you're launching your red pill grenades, you're launching your red pill grenade launcher, we got like a red pill, you know, laser from space, just breaching those LEDs.
[02:43:45.477 --> 02:43:55.109]   You see, the problem is, the problem when we do this, and it's not a problem that we're doing it, the problem is, is you still, and it's so mind-blowing, It's so mind-blowing.
[02:43:55.229 --> 02:44:01.793]  I think the reason why this happens is people are so comfortable in the Matrix because I'm still in the first mindset.
[02:44:02.014 --> 02:44:04.095]  Maybe I'll get to the second mindset at the second segment.
[02:44:04.435 --> 02:44:04.695]  All right?
[02:44:04.976 --> 02:44:09.839]  The first mindset is an individual that continually gets the red pill.
[02:44:10.019 --> 02:44:11.260]  They get it every day.
[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:12.741]  They're getting it from Alex.
[02:44:12.761 --> 02:44:13.502]  There it is right there.
[02:44:13.522 --> 02:44:13.882]  There it is.
[02:44:13.922 --> 02:44:14.302]  That's us.
[02:44:14.322 --> 02:44:15.143]  That's Alex Jones.
[02:44:15.183 --> 02:44:15.423]  Boom.
[02:44:15.443 --> 02:44:16.023]  Drew Hernandez.
[02:44:16.103 --> 02:44:16.404]  Owen Troy.
[02:44:16.444 --> 02:44:16.904]  Boom!
[02:44:17.444 --> 02:44:18.405]  Breaching that Matrix!
[02:44:18.525 --> 02:44:19.766]  Shattering it entirely!
[02:44:20.618 --> 02:44:21.639]  And people are waking up!
[02:44:21.659 --> 02:44:22.600]  There's Alex right there!
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:24.281]  Infowars.com!
[02:44:24.622 --> 02:44:27.024]  Infowars.com, baby!
[02:44:27.344 --> 02:44:28.625]  Ban that video!
[02:44:29.046 --> 02:44:30.187]  Open your mind!
[02:44:30.207 --> 02:44:32.049]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:44:33.135 --> 02:44:35.036]  But that's what's happening, and there it is, right there.
[02:44:35.456 --> 02:44:36.756]  That's the total darkness.
[02:44:38.197 --> 02:44:42.599]  You live in a dark simulated AI world that's all satanically empowered.
[02:44:42.979 --> 02:44:45.660]  There's Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum, all freaking out.
[02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:46.700]  How do we patch this?
[02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:47.661]  We gotta patch this!
[02:44:47.841 --> 02:44:48.561]  Get us a patch!
[02:44:48.781 --> 02:44:49.481]  Get us a patch!
[02:44:49.662 --> 02:44:51.402]  Mark Zuckerberg, get down here!
[02:44:51.582 --> 02:44:52.943]  Let's revive Jack Dorsey!
[02:44:53.123 --> 02:44:53.843]  Get him down here!
[02:44:54.003 --> 02:44:54.904]  We need Bill Gates!
[02:44:55.064 --> 02:44:55.784]  Put a patch in!
[02:44:55.844 --> 02:44:56.604]  Put a patch in!
[02:44:56.884 --> 02:44:57.545]  Alex Jones!
[02:44:57.765 --> 02:44:58.345]  InfoWars!
[02:44:58.385 --> 02:44:59.585]  True, they breached again!
[02:44:59.906 --> 02:45:00.866]  Shut down the patch!
[02:45:04.645 --> 02:45:09.087]  You know, the sad, god-honest truth is that this is all true.
[02:45:09.107 --> 02:45:10.828]  This is the war.
[02:45:10.888 --> 02:45:11.969]  This is the info war.
[02:45:12.029 --> 02:45:16.671]  This is the technological, futuristic war that the Bible has spoken about.
[02:45:17.375 --> 02:45:23.199]  Where you have the centralized economy, you have the Catholic society, you have all these systems in place.
[02:45:23.759 --> 02:45:34.247]  If you were to tell someone, I mean, a lot of the theologians that would read the book of Revelation really had a hard time understanding how in the world would a one-world economic system be enforced?
[02:45:34.427 --> 02:45:35.267]  How would that happen?
[02:45:35.327 --> 02:45:44.734]  Because they didn't have the ability to comprehend such a technology at the time without their minds venturing into some kind of magic, which the Bible forbid!
[02:45:45.345 --> 02:45:48.747]  But now we know if you live in 2023, you know exactly how that's going to go down.
[02:45:49.087 --> 02:45:50.308]  You got the World Economic Forum.
[02:45:50.328 --> 02:45:51.229]  You got the United Nations.
[02:45:51.249 --> 02:45:53.870]  They're all literally calling for the cashless societies.
[02:45:54.871 --> 02:45:56.212]  And there's no excuse at this point.
[02:45:56.772 --> 02:46:01.275]  There's so many red pills going out, so many red pill grenades going out, so many red pill grenade launchers.
[02:46:01.655 --> 02:46:04.297]  You know, we got red pill nuclear warheads, man.
[02:46:04.337 --> 02:46:06.478]  We got the new codes to the red pill.
[02:46:06.498 --> 02:46:07.339]  It's called the gospel.
[02:46:07.359 --> 02:46:08.520]  It's called Jesus Christ.
[02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:09.160]  All right.
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:11.882]  We got those warheads locked and loaded, baby.
[02:46:11.902 --> 02:46:13.523]  And we are here every single day.
[02:46:14.252 --> 02:46:19.616]  We are here every single day, communicating to the public, pulling people out of the matrix.
[02:46:19.656 --> 02:46:26.101]  But that first mindset, guys, and that first mindset is someone that is continually getting these red pills.
[02:46:26.441 --> 02:46:28.703]  They're seeing those breached LED screens.
[02:46:29.043 --> 02:46:36.049]  They're seeing that there's two choices, and they continue to take that blue pill over and over and over and over.
[02:46:36.449 --> 02:46:38.591]  It's like they're just totally sedated, man.
[02:46:39.191 --> 02:46:45.241]   The blue pill is a total just It's a substance to sedate you.
[02:46:45.601 --> 02:46:52.225]  Not only to keep you jacked into the Matrix, but it's to keep you numb and sedated so you don't wake up.
[02:46:52.245 --> 02:46:55.487]  But every now and then, that red pill, it will, it will.
[02:46:55.927 --> 02:46:57.568]  It will wake you up, but they'll still deny it.
[02:46:57.588 --> 02:46:58.989]  I'll get to the second mindset when we come back.
[02:46:59.009 --> 02:46:59.890]  Stay with us.
[02:46:59.910 --> 02:47:00.930]  Alright guys, I'm for real.
[02:47:01.611 --> 02:47:14.573]   I'm telling you guys, that first mindset, that first mindset of the individual that gets presented the red pills or the blue pills, You know, the problem with the blue pill is that it's a sedative, man.
[02:47:14.593 --> 02:47:15.594]  It keeps you sedated.
[02:47:16.575 --> 02:47:17.595]  And it keeps you asleep.
[02:47:18.716 --> 02:47:19.457]  You know, it's interesting.
[02:47:19.637 --> 02:47:22.139]  They think that they're woke, but in reality, they're all asleep.
[02:47:22.339 --> 02:47:25.722]  The ones that are truly awake are those that are truly born again.
[02:47:26.623 --> 02:47:29.345]  They not only see the truth, but they accept the truth.
[02:47:29.385 --> 02:47:30.906]  They lay their pride aside.
[02:47:32.107 --> 02:47:33.388]  They lay their pride aside.
[02:47:33.929 --> 02:47:37.652]  And in order to really accept the truth, you're gonna have to admit you're wrong at some point.
[02:47:38.052 --> 02:47:43.084]   Because all of us end up in a place in our lives where We thought we knew one thing.
[02:47:44.445 --> 02:47:47.546]  And then Morpheus, Alex Jones shows up knocking on your door.
[02:47:49.067 --> 02:47:50.888]  And then you realize you knew nothing.
[02:47:50.908 --> 02:47:52.108]  You knew nothing.
[02:47:52.889 --> 02:47:54.970]  And you know, we continue to learn.
[02:47:55.010 --> 02:47:56.410]  We continue to red pill ourselves.
[02:47:56.430 --> 02:47:57.511]  We continue to educate.
[02:47:57.551 --> 02:47:58.631]  You know, never stop learning.
[02:47:58.671 --> 02:48:00.692]  Never stop downloading truth.
[02:48:00.732 --> 02:48:02.873]  Never stop downloading the correct intel.
[02:48:03.234 --> 02:48:05.775]  Because the New World Order wants you just kind of like stuck.
[02:48:06.415 --> 02:48:07.196]  All right, they want you.
[02:48:07.356 --> 02:48:13.781]  Oh, well, you know, you went to community college or you went to a four year college and you graduated and you're done learning.
[02:48:13.921 --> 02:48:14.301]  That's it.
[02:48:14.441 --> 02:48:14.922]  You're done.
[02:48:15.482 --> 02:48:16.783]  You know, you know everything now.
[02:48:16.843 --> 02:48:20.686]  No, that's that's that's the worst place you could be intellectually.
[02:48:20.986 --> 02:48:24.889]  We're supposed to always be learning, always be downloading the correct information.
[02:48:25.189 --> 02:48:27.031]  Always be advancing intellectually.
[02:48:27.351 --> 02:48:29.573]  Always challenging and stimulating our minds.
[02:48:29.713 --> 02:48:32.536]  Always moving forward as an individual.
[02:48:32.957 --> 02:48:34.858]  So you get smarter and smarter.
[02:48:34.918 --> 02:48:37.201]  You begin to discern the world differently.
[02:48:37.241 --> 02:48:42.145]  You begin to be able to, you know, master the art of discernment that's given by God.
[02:48:42.165 --> 02:48:49.753]   And if you kind of stay in the same place intellectually for so long, then you're going to end up the type of individual That will get left behind!
[02:48:49.773 --> 02:48:51.676]  Okay, because I'll tell you one thing.
[02:48:52.096 --> 02:48:58.124]  These New World Order agents of Lucifer, these agents of Satan, a lot of these people are very intellectually advanced.
[02:48:58.445 --> 02:48:59.506]  They're not just dummies.
[02:48:59.526 --> 02:49:01.409]  I mean, yes, some of them are.
[02:49:01.449 --> 02:49:02.991]  You look at the Better Neck puppet.
[02:49:03.091 --> 02:49:05.855]  You look at the Joe Biden, the Sniffer-in-Chief puppet.
[02:49:06.557 --> 02:49:11.220]  Some of them, they want those puppets, but some of them are very intellectually advanced.
[02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:12.181]  They know their stuff.
[02:49:12.321 --> 02:49:13.282]  They know what they're doing.
[02:49:13.322 --> 02:49:21.627]  They know how to build satanic, global, you know, corporate, crony, capitalistic, centralized, you know, corporate.
[02:49:22.546 --> 02:49:24.027]  They know what they're doing.
[02:49:24.067 --> 02:49:25.727]  They established the World Economic Forum.
[02:49:25.907 --> 02:49:34.690]  They strategically allow themselves to be used as pawns of Lucifer to strategically place these organizations, the World Economic Forum, the World Health Organization.
[02:49:34.890 --> 02:49:45.133]  When the United Nations was implemented, the European Union, it was all just pushing us further and further and further into a one world, new world order.
[02:49:45.945 --> 02:49:46.125]  Right?
[02:49:46.225 --> 02:49:47.126]  Unity sounds great.
[02:49:47.146 --> 02:49:48.006]  It sounds amazing.
[02:49:48.346 --> 02:49:50.647]  It sounds like, let's all just come together and have peace.
[02:49:50.948 --> 02:49:52.588]  But who's pushing for the unity?
[02:49:52.849 --> 02:49:54.830]  And what kind of unity is it actually?
[02:49:55.210 --> 02:49:58.051]  Is it unification around ideologies of evil?
[02:49:58.351 --> 02:50:02.073]  Is it unification against, you know, free people, free thinking individuals?
[02:50:02.333 --> 02:50:04.355]  Is it unification against Jesus Christ?
[02:50:04.715 --> 02:50:10.638]  Is it unification against that which is truly good and that which is truly righteous and just?
[02:50:11.058 --> 02:50:18.524]   Is it unification of evil demonic powers going against something that is 100% true, honest, and good?
[02:50:19.585 --> 02:50:21.528]  What kind of unification are we talking about here?
[02:50:21.548 --> 02:50:23.552]  You see, I'll get to the second mindset.
[02:50:23.972 --> 02:50:26.757]  And the second mindset is this, and I think this is the worst.
[02:50:27.577 --> 02:50:32.500]  When you get delusional NPCs, people that are, you know, getting presented the red pills constantly.
[02:50:32.540 --> 02:50:34.562]  They're seeing those breached LED screens.
[02:50:35.022 --> 02:50:38.244]  They're aware something's going on, but they tell themselves it's not happening.
[02:50:39.045 --> 02:50:41.466]  That's a horrible low IQ right there.
[02:50:41.507 --> 02:50:42.807]  That's a low IQ.
[02:50:43.188 --> 02:50:45.049]  That's like infant thinking.
[02:50:45.329 --> 02:50:47.591]  That's like, you know, just straight caveman.
[02:50:48.131 --> 02:50:49.712]  Just, you know, barbarian thinking.
[02:50:49.752 --> 02:50:51.193]  Just stupid thinking.
[02:50:51.233 --> 02:50:53.835]  People that are just like watching something right in front of their eyes.
[02:50:53.875 --> 02:51:07.300]   But that's the advancements of The levels of deception that the devil has fully accomplished on millions of humans on planet Earth, which is pretty impressive, by the way.
[02:51:07.320 --> 02:51:09.000]  I don't say that in a positive way.
[02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:13.741]  I just acknowledge that it's obviously advanced, and this is what we're up against.
[02:51:13.761 --> 02:51:15.042]  This is why you must be born again.
[02:51:15.082 --> 02:51:17.523]  You must be jacked out of the Matrix to truly see what's going on.
[02:51:18.123 --> 02:51:20.523]  But the other mindset I'll say is this.
[02:51:21.804 --> 02:51:37.098]   This other Matrix mindset is someone, and I find this one To be really, really bad, because I see it a lot, and I think all the InfoWarriors out there, if you've been a viewer of Alex Jones for maybe just two years, right?
[02:51:37.759 --> 02:51:50.668]  And you become an InfoWarrior, you're just launching your red pill grenades, you get yourself a red-pilled, you know, InfoWars battle tank, and you're just, you know, you're just launching those 40, you're just launching them continually, right?
[02:51:50.688 --> 02:51:53.210]  Those anti-tank missile red pills, right?
[02:51:54.390 --> 02:52:11.282]  Uh, you know, you're launching them at your family, you're launching them at your co-workers, here and there you send a text message of an AJ clip from, you know, the, you know, have you guys seen that one that has been going viral again recently of Alex predicting 9-11, like, a couple months before it happened?
[02:52:11.323 --> 02:52:12.363]  Like, stuff like that, right?
[02:52:12.383 --> 02:52:13.504]  People are like, what?
[02:52:14.045 --> 02:52:14.225]  What?
[02:52:15.328 --> 02:52:16.009]  CIA?
[02:52:16.089 --> 02:52:17.630]  I thought Osama Bin Laden... What?
[02:52:17.670 --> 02:52:18.611]  What do you mean?
[02:52:19.271 --> 02:52:22.193]  Is there any... I remember when my mom got red-pilled on 9-11.
[02:52:22.273 --> 02:52:26.096]  It was like the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[02:52:26.396 --> 02:52:34.002]  When I introduced my... I mean, at first, when my mom became born again, I read, you know, I Christ-pilled her and her whole eyes opened up to everything.
[02:52:35.182 --> 02:52:38.405]  But when I red-pilled her on 9-11, I was like, hey, let's watch this.
[02:52:38.845 --> 02:52:39.866]  Let's just watch this, mom.
[02:52:39.886 --> 02:52:40.286]  What do you think?
[02:52:41.994 --> 02:52:43.935]  What do you think of those, uh, controlled demolitions?
[02:52:43.955 --> 02:52:47.195]  Do you think that those buildings look very similar to controlled demolitions?
[02:52:47.916 --> 02:52:51.136]  You know, what do you think about these experts that are all coming out and saying the same thing?
[02:52:51.156 --> 02:52:53.637]  That there's no way that those two buildings could freefall like that.
[02:52:54.297 --> 02:53:00.279]  And there's no way that, you know, building in Tower 7 just, just, just, you know, happened to fall over because of fires!
[02:53:01.583 --> 02:53:03.245]  Oh, by the way, mom, did you know what was inside?
[02:53:03.765 --> 02:53:07.368]  You know who was inside Tower 7 and everything that kind of disappeared?
[02:53:07.388 --> 02:53:17.197]  Oh, by the way, do you know the insurance policy payouts that were all in motion months before, uh, that the towers literally were, uh, controlled demolition, mom?
[02:53:17.337 --> 02:53:18.538]  Dude, it was crazy.
[02:53:18.759 --> 02:53:20.300]  Watching my mom get red-pilled on 9-11.
[02:53:20.400 --> 02:53:21.501]  I wish I recorded that.
[02:53:21.641 --> 02:53:26.845]   I wish that was like, I did a show on that or something because you guys don't know, anyways, anyways, it's a process!
[02:53:27.085 --> 02:53:32.829]  See, but here's the thing, I'm getting sidetracked, I'm ADD, I'm doing it again, alright, let's get back, let's get back on track.
[02:53:33.749 --> 02:53:38.973]  So, the second mindset is someone that gets presented a red pill, alright?
[02:53:39.653 --> 02:53:42.555]  Someone that gets presented accurate information.
[02:53:43.115 --> 02:53:54.381]   I'm not talking about some like, far out, unconfirmed, you know, not accurately fact-checked story, Or information.
[02:53:54.501 --> 02:53:56.642]  And when I say fact-checked, I'm not saying snopes.
[02:53:56.722 --> 02:53:59.282]  I'm saying like, no, you really sought this thing out.
[02:53:59.962 --> 02:54:00.922]  You are a free thinker.
[02:54:01.443 --> 02:54:03.223]  You got this thing down yourself.
[02:54:03.623 --> 02:54:04.883]  This is reality, baby.
[02:54:05.103 --> 02:54:05.443]  All right?
[02:54:06.984 --> 02:54:10.224]  You see, the problem with the second mindset is someone that gets the red pill.
[02:54:11.764 --> 02:54:24.120]   And it's like, the denial is when they go back to the blue, but they tell themselves, While they do it, that could never happen to me.
[02:54:24.881 --> 02:54:27.083]  This is a mindset that I find insane.
[02:54:28.244 --> 02:54:32.548]  Because it's one thing to sit there in total delusion and say, well that's not happening!
[02:54:32.828 --> 02:54:33.869]  I'm sitting in my house!
[02:54:34.209 --> 02:54:35.470]  My house is burning down!
[02:54:35.711 --> 02:54:37.392]  My children are all incinerating!
[02:54:37.552 --> 02:54:38.613]  They're all dying!
[02:54:38.873 --> 02:54:39.454]  But you know what?
[02:54:39.874 --> 02:54:40.815]  It's not happening.
[02:54:41.536 --> 02:54:42.457]  Everything is fine.
[02:54:42.497 --> 02:54:43.397]  It's like the dog meme.
[02:54:43.998 --> 02:54:44.919]  Everything is fine.
[02:54:44.979 --> 02:54:45.860]  Everything is great.
[02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:48.222]  Everything is totally, totally fine.
[02:54:49.420 --> 02:54:52.641]  That's the first mindset that's in just total denial.
[02:54:52.701 --> 02:54:57.402]  And someone that's in total denial is someone that is sitting in a burning house.
[02:54:58.422 --> 02:55:00.643]  Their flesh is incinerating.
[02:55:00.683 --> 02:55:02.703]  They could smell their hair on fire!
[02:55:03.263 --> 02:55:04.824]  It's right there in front of their face.
[02:55:04.844 --> 02:55:06.644]  It's knocking on their door.
[02:55:06.664 --> 02:55:13.786]  The FBI's literally all homosexualed out, all rainbowed, pride month, groomer month out.
[02:55:14.466 --> 02:55:19.989]  All the sodomites, Sodom and Gomorrah, knocking down their door, saying, we're coming for you and your children!
[02:55:20.009 --> 02:55:24.572]  Alright, you got them running around New York City, all chanting, we're coming for your children!
[02:55:24.772 --> 02:55:37.519]  They're all out in the open, they're in your house, they're inside the city gates, they're there to abduct your children, your children are gone, and you are still sitting there telling yourself, this isn't happening, everything is fine.
[02:55:37.639 --> 02:55:40.241]  Guys, it's just, you gotta wake up.
[02:55:40.441 --> 02:55:43.283]  And I'm not saying the Infowarriors, I'm saying those that are still in the Matrix.

[02:56:39.213 --> 02:56:47.940]  He's called every single one of us in this fight to expose the global New World Order, to unmask the devil, to be the light, to expose what's being done in the dark.
[02:56:48.420 --> 02:56:51.302]  So make sure to go support InfoWarsTore.com right now.

[02:58:07.346 --> 02:58:08.886]  Alright, that second mindset, guys!
[02:58:09.346 --> 02:58:10.587]  That second mindset!
[02:58:11.467 --> 02:58:12.428]  I got to it!
[02:58:12.688 --> 02:58:14.669]  I got to it 30 minutes into the show!
[02:58:15.049 --> 02:58:16.149]  That second mindset!
[02:58:16.189 --> 02:58:17.870]  I promise I'm not gonna get sidetracked.
[02:58:18.530 --> 02:58:19.631]  That second mindset.
[02:58:20.551 --> 02:58:20.871]  Alright?
[02:58:21.371 --> 02:58:23.712]  The first one is someone that is in total denial.
[02:58:23.772 --> 02:58:25.013]  They're sitting in the burning house.
[02:58:25.751 --> 02:58:35.459]  Their children are on fire, they can smell their skin, they can smell their hair, but they still will not receive that red pill.
[02:58:35.499 --> 02:58:38.721]  They still want that blue pill to just make it all go away.
[02:58:38.741 --> 02:58:41.223]  They're in total denial that it's happening, right?
[02:58:41.944 --> 02:58:47.828]  But I would say the second mindset that is very troubling is someone that does acknowledge it.
[02:58:49.149 --> 02:58:51.011]  Someone that does acknowledge Bill Gates.
[02:58:51.835 --> 02:58:54.156]  Someone that does acknowledge what the UN is doing.
[02:58:54.176 --> 02:58:55.097]  And we're going to get to the story.
[02:58:55.117 --> 02:58:56.678]  I promise you guys, we're going to get to the story.
[02:58:57.018 --> 02:58:57.898]  I wanted to cover this.
[02:58:57.938 --> 02:59:00.440]  I wanted to give my take on it for InfoWars.
[02:59:01.280 --> 02:59:05.742]  But I'll tell you, it's someone that is watching what's happening with the UN.
[02:59:05.782 --> 02:59:11.445]  It's someone that lived through 2020 and the lockdowns and the World Health Organization and all their tyranny.
[02:59:11.465 --> 02:59:18.649]  These unelected bureaucrats that somehow ended up, you know, influencing legislation policy in the United States of America and globally.
[02:59:19.249 --> 02:59:22.477]   It was someone that is Paying attention.
[02:59:22.797 --> 02:59:23.738]  They get red pills.
[02:59:24.138 --> 02:59:25.459]  They get a video sent to them.
[02:59:25.959 --> 02:59:26.960]  Oh wow, that's interesting.
[02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:27.981]  That kind of makes sense.
[02:59:28.341 --> 02:59:30.223]  Whoa, look at what the government is doing.
[02:59:30.303 --> 02:59:30.543]  What?
[02:59:30.603 --> 02:59:31.644]  They want to monitor me?
[02:59:31.904 --> 02:59:33.225]  They want a social credit score?
[02:59:33.245 --> 02:59:34.506]  A digital currency?
[02:59:34.786 --> 02:59:36.748]  Doesn't the Bible kind of like talk about something like that?
[02:59:37.344 --> 02:59:38.264]  What is going on here?
[02:59:38.765 --> 02:59:39.705]  They locked me down?
[02:59:40.285 --> 02:59:46.767]  You see, when you get someone that's kind of, they're seeing the red pill, but they're not taking it, like it's in their hand.
[02:59:46.827 --> 02:59:47.928]  It's literally in their hand.
[02:59:48.108 --> 02:59:50.148]  The intel's right there, right?
[02:59:50.168 --> 02:59:51.349]  They grabbed the red pill.
[02:59:51.709 --> 02:59:53.109]  This is someone that grabs it.
[02:59:53.129 --> 02:59:54.410]  And they're looking at it.
[02:59:55.090 --> 02:59:56.190]  They're contemplating.
[02:59:56.991 --> 02:59:57.851]  They're questioning.
[02:59:58.908 --> 03:00:00.869]  They're kinda- They're getting closer!
[03:00:00.909 --> 03:00:02.729]  They're getting closer to getting jacked out!
[03:00:03.269 --> 03:00:05.170]  They're getting closer to getting jacked out of the Matrix!
[03:00:05.590 --> 03:00:06.430]  They're almost there!
[03:00:06.931 --> 03:00:07.671]  They're like, ugh!
[03:00:08.591 --> 03:00:10.852]  I think I'm- I- I think this is true!
[03:00:10.872 --> 03:00:13.773]  I- I think this is- This is all real!
[03:00:14.173 --> 03:00:15.013]  It's all real!
[03:00:15.473 --> 03:00:16.173]  It's- All of it!
[03:00:16.413 --> 03:00:16.974]  It's true!
[03:00:17.294 --> 03:00:17.614]  All of it!
[03:00:17.634 --> 03:00:19.334]  It's like Harrison Ford in The Force Awakens!
[03:00:19.634 --> 03:00:20.115]  It's true!
[03:00:20.215 --> 03:00:20.695]  The rumors!
[03:00:20.735 --> 03:00:21.275]  The stories!
[03:00:21.575 --> 03:00:22.415]  It's all true!
[03:00:22.916 --> 03:00:23.136]  Right?
[03:00:23.156 --> 03:00:23.736]  They're right there!
[03:00:23.776 --> 03:00:24.576]  They're about to take it!
[03:00:25.576 --> 03:00:26.717]  But they tell themselves.
[03:00:26.997 --> 03:00:27.437]  You know what?
[03:00:28.357 --> 03:00:29.937]  This could never happen to me.
[03:00:31.238 --> 03:00:31.758]  You know what?
[03:00:32.078 --> 03:00:34.578]  What's happening in France, that's never gonna happen.
[03:00:34.658 --> 03:00:37.279]  Here, they push that red pill further away.
[03:00:37.919 --> 03:00:44.340]  Oh, what happened in Cami, Cuba, Fidel Castro, with the social communism, that's never gonna happen.
[03:00:44.420 --> 03:00:46.881]  Here, they push that red pill further away.
[03:00:47.321 --> 03:00:47.641]  Really?
[03:00:47.661 --> 03:00:49.541]  North Korea, totally blacked out?
[03:00:49.561 --> 03:00:50.841]  You can't even see it on a satellite?
[03:00:50.861 --> 03:00:52.002]  You know what I mean?
[03:00:52.022 --> 03:00:53.602]  Like, it's just totally dark.
[03:00:54.389 --> 03:00:55.510]  That's not going to happen here!
[03:00:55.610 --> 03:00:56.692]  This is America!
[03:00:56.712 --> 03:01:00.316]  They push that red pill further and further and further away.
[03:01:00.336 --> 03:01:05.782]  And they don't even realize they got that blue pill still right there in their hand.
[03:01:06.463 --> 03:01:13.771]  Until finally they convince themselves, while everything is happening around them, well you know, that's never going to happen here.
[03:01:14.566 --> 03:01:16.809]  I see all of these tyrannical psychos.
[03:01:17.049 --> 03:01:18.671]  I see the World Economic Forum.
[03:01:19.232 --> 03:01:20.233]  I see what they're doing.
[03:01:20.273 --> 03:01:22.576]  I see that they're calling for a cashless society.
[03:01:22.796 --> 03:01:25.099]  They want to monitor everything digitally.
[03:01:25.299 --> 03:01:26.921]  They want to monitor my movements.
[03:01:26.961 --> 03:01:28.403]  They want facial recognition.
[03:01:29.304 --> 03:01:36.608]  The World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, they love China, they all praise the CCP, the same people that literally enslave their people.
[03:01:38.089 --> 03:01:48.094]  Zero COVID lockdowns, they weld their people into their apartments and burn down the buildings and they love it and praise it because, well, they're just peasants anyways, more room for us.
[03:01:49.475 --> 03:01:56.999]  Maybe we can erect a new building with a, you know, a facial recognition AI infrastructure to monitor all the other peasants, right?
[03:01:57.019 --> 03:01:58.020]  That's how these people think.
[03:01:59.164 --> 03:02:00.906]  You know, I know that they're all calling for this.
[03:02:01.347 --> 03:02:05.172]  I know that all this tyranny exists, but that's in other parts of the world.
[03:02:05.693 --> 03:02:07.275]  That's in other countries.
[03:02:07.595 --> 03:02:12.041]  That's in uncivilized countries where they just don't have their act together.
[03:02:12.061 --> 03:02:12.983]  See, these are people.
[03:02:13.857 --> 03:02:21.561]  That are not only in total denial that it's happening, but they convince themselves and they take that blue pill that it can't happen to them.
[03:02:21.801 --> 03:02:26.743]  That is a mindset that is not only weak, but that is a mindset that is dangerous.
[03:02:27.184 --> 03:02:40.070]  And the reason why that kind of mindset is dangerous, because that's someone that is not only plugged into the matrix, but that's someone that has literally convinced themselves that tyranny does not exist and it cannot happen to them.
[03:02:40.430 --> 03:02:41.631]  Actually, I take that back.
[03:02:41.851 --> 03:02:46.613]  They do convince themselves that tyranny exists, but it could never happen to them.
[03:02:46.673 --> 03:02:58.198]  That is like the type of mindset where I think maybe like a lot of Americans, maybe the past 30, maybe 40 years, kind of adopted where, well, that could never happen here.
[03:02:58.238 --> 03:02:58.918]  This is America.
[03:02:58.958 --> 03:02:59.398]  Yeah, right.
[03:02:59.458 --> 03:02:59.978]  Fascism.
[03:03:00.359 --> 03:03:00.799]  Yeah, right.
[03:03:00.859 --> 03:03:01.219]  Tyranny.
[03:03:01.379 --> 03:03:02.479]  That'll never happen here.
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:03.380]  Are you kidding me?
[03:03:04.665 --> 03:03:06.647]  Look how fast forward things have become.
[03:03:06.987 --> 03:03:14.753]  Look how the New World Order and the deep state operatives have gone into overdrive, I would argue, just the Trump presidency alone.
[03:03:15.333 --> 03:03:17.234]  Just the Trump presidency alone.
[03:03:17.535 --> 03:03:23.039]  And once they literally removed him and installed their regime, they went into overdrive.
[03:03:23.059 --> 03:03:24.660]  Do you guys remember post J6?
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.322]  Everything they were saying on CNN and MSNBC?
[03:03:27.722 --> 03:03:34.506]   Oh yeah, well the mega parents of children, they should be separated And somehow reprogrammed.
[03:03:34.706 --> 03:03:36.327]  Guys, they were saying all this stuff on CNN.
[03:03:36.547 --> 03:03:38.588]  Let's reprogram the mega people.
[03:03:38.608 --> 03:03:40.668]  Let's reprogram their minds.
[03:03:40.988 --> 03:03:43.029]  Let's just, you know, strip them of their children.
[03:03:43.189 --> 03:03:44.889]  Because look how dangerous these people are.
[03:03:44.929 --> 03:03:46.610]  They were just foaming at the mouth.
[03:03:47.090 --> 03:03:48.750]  They were waiting for a false flag.
[03:03:48.990 --> 03:03:49.971]  So they had a reason.
[03:03:50.011 --> 03:03:53.292]  They already convinced the public that you're a mega Republican domestic terrorist.
[03:03:53.312 --> 03:03:56.132]  Then they went further post-2021 with the Biden regime.
[03:03:56.152 --> 03:03:58.253]  And they're continuing to this day.
[03:03:58.933 --> 03:04:01.814]  They run the PSYOPs on the minds to convince people that you're a threat.
[03:04:02.938 --> 03:04:06.201]  They convince people that you're the threat, while in reality, they're the threat.
[03:04:07.121 --> 03:04:11.385]  While also convincing the normie that I'm talking about, that this could never happen to them.
[03:04:11.485 --> 03:04:13.106]  These are dangerous types of people.
[03:04:13.487 --> 03:04:18.471]  People that take the red pill, but they throw it away because they believe it could never happen to them.
[03:04:18.531 --> 03:04:23.235]  Therefore, they take that blue pill sedative, and they go back to sleep, and go back into the Matrix.
[03:04:23.255 --> 03:04:26.377]  Because a lot of people, they don't want to rock the boat.
[03:04:28.078 --> 03:04:33.742]   You know, for whatever reason, people just, I don't know if it's like this beta-cuck, you know what I mean?
[03:04:33.962 --> 03:04:40.129]  This beta-cucked mentality of passive, you know, not even passive-aggressive, just passive.
[03:04:40.510 --> 03:04:42.872]  Just passive men, passive males.
[03:04:42.973 --> 03:04:45.536]  I cannot stand a passive man.
[03:04:46.196 --> 03:04:49.999]  It is the most beta thing that I, it's just so ridiculous.
[03:04:50.259 --> 03:04:54.242]  Some of these like male homosexuals, they actually like stand on what they believe.
[03:04:54.262 --> 03:04:57.285]  I'm not saying that I'm for that, but like they stand on their own two feet.
[03:04:57.585 --> 03:05:05.651]   But some of these like beta male cuckservatives like, oh, I'm not going to be controversial or speak the truth because I don't want to offend somebody.
[03:05:05.671 --> 03:05:08.413]  And I want to make sure that I, you know, that I win them over.
[03:05:08.474 --> 03:05:10.215]  And if I don't, I'm going to offend someone.
[03:05:10.235 --> 03:05:14.618]  So we have to find common ground to make sure that you're saying things in a nice way.
[03:05:14.658 --> 03:05:15.199]  Shut up!
[03:05:15.539 --> 03:05:16.019]  Shut up!
[03:05:16.740 --> 03:05:22.104]  I cannot stand passive males and obviously passive females.
[03:05:22.364 --> 03:05:26.768]  The passive mentality needs to go because all cucks must go.
[03:05:27.068 --> 03:05:29.130]  All cucks must be deported now.
[03:05:30.379 --> 03:05:31.259]  What's going on, guys?
[03:05:31.279 --> 03:05:33.240]  You have entered the cuck-free zone!
[03:05:34.540 --> 03:05:36.381]  You have entered the cuck-free zone!

[03:05:39.502 --> 03:05:40.502]  The Alex Jones Show!
[03:05:40.522 --> 03:05:41.282]  The Fourth Hour!
[03:05:41.342 --> 03:05:43.123]  I'm your guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[03:05:43.643 --> 03:05:52.445]  I promised you guys we'd get into some of this news, and I wanted to comment on this story, so if the crew is ready, I know we posted it earlier, but I want to get into this.
[03:05:52.545 --> 03:05:57.487]  This is a report from the Gateway Pundit, which I think people need to pay serious attention to.
[03:05:58.334 --> 03:06:03.458]  The United Nations is trying to seize global emergency powers with support from Biden.
[03:06:04.199 --> 03:06:09.844]  So this is clear evidence that the New World Order is attempting to infiltrate the US government at the federal level.
[03:06:09.864 --> 03:06:25.977]  This is why I keep telling people Biden is nothing but a vegetable and a puppet because all of his handlers will be open to the EU, open to the UN, and open to all of these satanic global agendas that they want to deploy to seize power in the United States of America.
[03:06:26.037 --> 03:06:26.938]  Here are some details.
[03:06:28.152 --> 03:06:29.212]  It's extremely alarming.
[03:06:29.793 --> 03:06:42.097]  In September 2024, less than two months before the next United States presidential election, the United Nations will host a landmark summit of the future where member nations will adopt a pact for the future.
[03:06:42.457 --> 03:06:52.508]   The agreement will solidify numerous policy reforms offered by the United Nations over the past two years as part of its sweeping Our common agenda platform.
[03:06:52.848 --> 03:07:01.833]  Although there are numerous radical proposals included in the agenda, perhaps none are more important than the UN plan for a new, quote, emergency platform, unquote.
[03:07:02.333 --> 03:07:08.156]  A stunning proposal to give the UN significant powers in the event of future, quote, global shocks.
[03:07:09.195 --> 03:07:13.576]  Whatever the hell that means, such as another worldwide pandemic.
[03:07:14.056 --> 03:07:27.298]  Once triggered, the emergency platform would give the United Nations the ability to, quote, actively promote and drive an international response that places the principles of equity and solidarity at the center of its work.
[03:07:28.018 --> 03:07:32.979]  What's interesting about this as well is they also get to define how long it lasts, according to the report.
[03:07:33.239 --> 03:07:44.474]   So not only will they seize power of the federal government, Not only will the United Nations seize power, they get to determine what's the next pandemic, or they get to determine what's an emergency power.
[03:07:44.494 --> 03:07:50.557]  It's like martial law on steroids from a foreign land, a foreign entity that's unelected, that's not American!
[03:07:50.577 --> 03:08:02.243]  That's coming in and they're attempting to seize power and infiltrating the United States government, bypassing the Constitution, bypassing the United States, bypassing the American people, bypassing American leadership.
[03:08:02.523 --> 03:08:05.905]  This is how the New World Order infiltrates and functions.
[03:08:06.185 --> 03:08:11.008]   This is That's why I've been telling people there's a reason why, okay, Puppet Biden was installed.
[03:08:11.428 --> 03:08:13.149]  Yes, Puppet Biden is a moron.
[03:08:13.389 --> 03:08:16.471]  Yes, Puppet Biden is running around and has no idea where he is.
[03:08:16.751 --> 03:08:18.452]  Yes, Puppet Biden is a vegetable.
[03:08:18.712 --> 03:08:21.394]  Yes, Puppet Biden belongs in a senior citizen home.
[03:08:21.654 --> 03:08:25.036]  Yes, Puppet Biden is totally gone in the mind.
[03:08:26.121 --> 03:08:27.702]  Dementia, you name it.
[03:08:28.122 --> 03:08:29.363]  But there's a reason for that.
[03:08:29.663 --> 03:08:32.345]  It's because of agendas like this.
[03:08:33.165 --> 03:08:40.369]  They want to seize power in the United States of America, and they need someone that will not say anything about it.
[03:08:40.749 --> 03:08:55.283]   So if they get a vegetable, especially in the executive branch, if they get a vegetable, especially in the Oval Office, if they get a vegetable that will question nothing, that will provide no pushback, that will simply do as they're told, because There!
[03:08:55.650 --> 03:08:55.976]  Literally!
[03:08:57.256 --> 03:08:59.616]  There's no, the lights are on, but nobody's home.
[03:08:59.776 --> 03:09:01.377]  That's literally puppet Joe Biden.
[03:09:01.417 --> 03:09:02.677]  That's why he was installed.
[03:09:03.057 --> 03:09:03.377]  Oh yeah.
[03:09:03.557 --> 03:09:09.618]  And that's exactly why you have the diversity hire, Cuckley, you know, Cuckery Kamala Harris, right?
[03:09:09.878 --> 03:09:10.778]  That's why she's there.
[03:09:10.818 --> 03:09:11.859]  She doesn't know anything.
[03:09:12.219 --> 03:09:13.779]  She's not going to provide any pushback.
[03:09:14.099 --> 03:09:19.560]  She's going to probably be even worse because they are simply, they're installed by their new world order handlers.
[03:09:19.760 --> 03:09:25.021]  They are simply put into position strategically for agendas like this.
[03:09:25.842 --> 03:09:27.543]  All right, we've all been seeing this developing.
[03:09:27.844 --> 03:09:29.905]  I don't know what's going to happen, but I will say this.
[03:09:31.066 --> 03:09:37.430]  I will say this is if by some miracle, President Trump wins the 2024 election.
[03:09:38.231 --> 03:09:42.154]  OK, if by some miracle, somehow, someway, because I don't have an answer yet.
[03:09:42.174 --> 03:09:43.154]  I'm like, the election's rigged.
[03:09:43.174 --> 03:09:43.935]  The election's rigged.
[03:09:44.015 --> 03:09:45.196]  Yeah, I see what they did in 2020.
[03:09:45.656 --> 03:09:49.399]  And yeah, I'm in Arizona and I saw what they did at Cary Lake, too.
[03:09:49.559 --> 03:09:49.839]  All right.
[03:09:50.420 --> 03:09:51.400]  And they're not stopping.
[03:09:51.601 --> 03:09:52.781]  They're not stopping at all.
[03:09:52.962 --> 03:09:54.763]  When they want to do it, they will do it.
[03:09:55.467 --> 03:09:57.748]  They will choose whether they want to rig an election or not.
[03:09:57.948 --> 03:09:59.508]  This is how banana republics function.
[03:09:59.528 --> 03:10:00.989]  This is how banana republics work.
[03:10:02.289 --> 03:10:04.370]  Now, sometimes they'll allow a W. Why?
[03:10:04.510 --> 03:10:06.030]  Maybe for strategic purposes.
[03:10:06.530 --> 03:10:13.092]  If by some miracle, somehow, someway, President Trump wins the 2024 election, stuff like this is going to be deployed.
[03:10:13.732 --> 03:10:15.273]  Mark my words, it already happened in 2020.
[03:10:15.593 --> 03:10:16.833]  They already did it in 2020.
[03:10:16.893 --> 03:10:40.842]   President Trump Rocking and rolling, all the way up until right before 2020, Deep State, New World Order, the World Health Organization, CCP, launch the bioweapon, dismantle the economies of the world, literally neuter the United States of America, implement, launch, deploy the World Health Organization, get Dr. Fauci in the White House, manipulate Trump, launch Operation Warp Speed, done, over.
[03:10:41.082 --> 03:10:41.382]  Alright?
[03:10:41.582 --> 03:10:42.263]  That's what happened.
[03:10:42.303 --> 03:10:43.284]  That's literally what happened.
[03:10:43.624 --> 03:10:43.884]  Alright?
[03:10:44.225 --> 03:10:48.107]  And people just have to sit there and hold Trump accountable to this kind of stuff.
[03:10:48.287 --> 03:10:51.610]  Now, the point I'm trying to make is, they let him back in.
[03:10:52.470 --> 03:10:55.672]  Don't think for a second they will not deploy that strategy again.
[03:10:55.892 --> 03:10:57.614]  They will, because they know it worked once.
[03:10:58.094 --> 03:11:02.377]  Now, how Trump will deal with that situation again, I don't know.
[03:11:03.137 --> 03:11:06.540]  I mean, my hope and my prayer is that he's somewhat learned.
[03:11:07.440 --> 03:11:08.261]  Somewhat learned.
[03:11:09.108 --> 03:11:21.992]  All the deep state operatives that were in the cabinet, all the deep state operatives that were in his circle, even some of his own family, that were hardcore liberal, totally for, you know, the New World Order and totally for, like, not America first.
[03:11:23.732 --> 03:11:36.736]  And understanding how these New World Order operations work, how the World Economic Forum is not your friend, how Klaus Schwab is not your friend, no matter how much they, you know, sit there and show face and smile at you and claim to praise you and want you at your events.
[03:11:37.779 --> 03:11:58.172]  Okay, hopefully President Trump has a different approach at dealing with the New World Order, at dealing with the global regime, dealing with the World Health Organization, dealing with the World Economic Forum, dealing with these globalist entities that clearly, clearly, the United Nations, the EU, that clearly have agendas locked and loaded, baby, locked and loaded.
[03:11:58.473 --> 03:12:05.347]   And I'll tell you, once they have this summit, You know that puppet, the puppet Biden administration is going to bend the knee to the UN.
[03:12:05.687 --> 03:12:09.730]  They're going to bend the knee, give them, oh, this is to protect our people.
[03:12:10.090 --> 03:12:14.993]  We had too many Americans, those dirty info warriors, those dirty freedom fighters.
[03:12:15.845 --> 03:12:18.328]  Those dirty patriots, they didn't lock down.
[03:12:18.608 --> 03:12:20.069]  They got people killed.
[03:12:20.450 --> 03:12:22.972]  They were the reason why we had COVID deaths.
[03:12:23.432 --> 03:12:24.373]  They were the reason.
[03:12:24.734 --> 03:12:37.286]  Those dirty peasants that didn't want to take the jabs, those dirty peasants that did not listen to Dr. Fauci, that did not listen to the great high priest of COVID, that did not mass formate, okay?
[03:12:37.626 --> 03:12:39.488]  All those peasants, they will get in line.
[03:12:42.117 --> 03:12:44.100]  Because you stupid Americans couldn't handle it.
[03:12:44.280 --> 03:12:45.622]  You couldn't get your people in check.
[03:12:45.862 --> 03:12:46.503]  You're weak.
[03:12:46.764 --> 03:12:47.985]  So now we need the UN.
[03:12:48.526 --> 03:12:54.414]  We're gonna send the UN so when it happens again, you won't have that problem ever again.
[03:12:54.434 --> 03:12:54.574]  Yeah.
[03:12:54.754 --> 03:12:56.637]  So I come out and say, well come and take it, baby.
[03:12:56.897 --> 03:13:00.099]  Come and take not only the firearms, but come and take the freedom, baby!
[03:13:00.319 --> 03:13:01.820]  Come and take my autonomy, baby!
[03:13:02.060 --> 03:13:02.541]  Let's go!
[03:13:02.821 --> 03:13:03.942]  Anti-New World Order!
[03:13:04.262 --> 03:13:05.303]  Anti-World Government!
[03:13:05.563 --> 03:13:06.403]  Anti-Tyranny!
[03:13:06.604 --> 03:13:07.364]  Let's go, baby!
[03:13:07.384 --> 03:13:09.445]  There's still millions of us here right now.
[03:13:09.726 --> 03:13:17.991]  I'm not calling for violence, but I will call for self-defense against anyone that wants to impose their tyranny and their violence on me.
[03:13:18.331 --> 03:13:18.692]  Period.
[03:13:18.872 --> 03:13:19.972]  That's what these people want.
[03:13:20.173 --> 03:13:25.896]  You think that these people are just gonna, you know, peacefully, you know, get you to comply moving into the future?
[03:13:25.916 --> 03:13:26.657]  Of course they're not.
[03:13:27.857 --> 03:13:29.378]  That's not what this regime is all about.
[03:13:30.078 --> 03:13:52.924]  Yes, they'll run PSYOPS, Saul Alinsky, they'll just get the people to accept the tyranny through, like what they're doing in France, just cause mass chaos, polarize two different groups of people, get them to have a civil war, rip themselves apart, so the people that don't want any a part of it, they're just begging, they're begging for Big Brother to step in and put a stop to all the chaos and bring stability, destabilization.
[03:13:54.285 --> 03:13:58.819]   Instead of putting your Your boot on the neck of society?
[03:13:59.760 --> 03:14:00.801]  Just run the PSYOP.
[03:14:00.881 --> 03:14:02.682]  Run operations on the society.
[03:14:02.742 --> 03:14:04.744]  Get them to accept the tyranny themselves.
[03:14:04.764 --> 03:14:07.106]  You know, that's not what the New World Order is going to do.
[03:14:07.446 --> 03:14:07.887]  They might.
[03:14:07.947 --> 03:14:08.267]  They might.
[03:14:08.287 --> 03:14:09.068]  They can go any way.
[03:14:09.108 --> 03:14:09.988]  They can go any way here.
[03:14:10.208 --> 03:14:11.750]  But I'll tell you what this is with the UN.
[03:14:12.851 --> 03:14:19.896]  If they let President Trump in, somehow, someway, he wins this election 2024, I don't know, by God's grace, by some miracle, it's going to have to happen, alright?
[03:14:20.397 --> 03:14:25.161]  Because if you really believe that this election was rigged, who knows what direction they're going to go?
[03:14:25.757 --> 03:14:28.218]  All right, there might be a reason why they're starting to strategize.
[03:14:28.258 --> 03:14:29.098]  Maybe they'll let him win.
[03:14:29.399 --> 03:14:31.239]  Maybe they want to go down that direction again.
[03:14:31.659 --> 03:14:44.045]  Maybe this will be the way to secure those UN powers and they'll do it with President Trump in office, make him look like a fool again, launch another bioweapon, or God knows what it could be.
[03:14:44.145 --> 03:14:45.445]  It could be the climate hysteria.
[03:14:45.505 --> 03:14:46.326]  It could be anything.
[03:14:46.566 --> 03:14:48.627]  What does emergency powers mean, guys?
[03:14:48.967 --> 03:14:49.527]  What does that mean?
[03:14:50.319 --> 03:14:53.620]  It could be literally, they could come out with the fake alien UFO invasion.
[03:14:53.780 --> 03:14:56.101]  They could come out and say, we're being invaded by aliens, guys.
[03:14:56.381 --> 03:14:57.021]  Don't look up.
[03:14:58.082 --> 03:14:59.262]  Like the movie, don't look up.
[03:14:59.802 --> 03:15:00.963]  Don't fact check this.
[03:15:01.223 --> 03:15:02.443]  Just believe what we're saying.
[03:15:02.723 --> 03:15:03.604]  Go into your home.
[03:15:03.804 --> 03:15:05.044]  There's aliens outside.
[03:15:05.244 --> 03:15:05.885]  They're hostile.
[03:15:05.905 --> 03:15:06.785]  They're all going to kill you.
[03:15:06.805 --> 03:15:07.525]  Just stay locked up.
[03:15:07.565 --> 03:15:09.166]  They could do anything, anything.
[03:15:09.866 --> 03:15:12.207]  They get to define what speech is hate speech, right?
[03:15:12.427 --> 03:15:16.008]  They get to define what's authorized or what's unauthorized, right?
[03:15:16.068 --> 03:15:17.329]  They get to define everything.
[03:15:17.369 --> 03:15:18.409]  And this will be the same thing.
[03:15:19.071 --> 03:15:20.111]  Archelon steroids.
[03:15:20.552 --> 03:15:22.532]  They will launch their bioweapon.
[03:15:22.812 --> 03:15:24.873]  They will launch their false flag.
[03:15:25.113 --> 03:15:28.334]  They will launch the next operation.
[03:15:28.614 --> 03:15:29.414]  What that may be?
[03:15:30.015 --> 03:15:30.575]  We don't know.
[03:15:30.715 --> 03:15:36.657]  But what I will predict and I will say is if they do let President Trump in, you could damn well, this is it.
[03:15:37.057 --> 03:15:40.178]  UN is going to seize those emergency powers and they'll launch it.
[03:15:40.862 --> 03:15:45.724]  Under an opponent so they can blame that opponent and seize those powers in the process.
[03:15:46.164 --> 03:15:47.665]  This is what the UN is pushing for.
[03:15:47.905 --> 03:15:49.005]  This is an official report.
[03:15:49.045 --> 03:15:49.986]  This is not fake news.
[03:15:50.206 --> 03:15:51.326]  This is not speculation.
[03:15:51.586 --> 03:15:59.430]  This is their own writings because the globalists love to put their own agendas out there and their own ideas out there and their own plans.
[03:15:59.790 --> 03:16:01.230]  All right, guys, I'll see you guys on the next one.
[03:16:01.090 --> 03:16:03.090]  War Room starts in just a couple minutes.
[03:16:03.090 --> 03:16:15.090]  [Music]
[03:16:15.090 --> 03:16:17.090]  Pretend you're on the air.
[03:16:16.484 --> 03:16:16.664]  Welcome.
[03:16:16.864 --> 03:16:17.684]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[03:16:17.704 --> 03:16:18.925]  Amazing broadcast, as always.
[03:16:18.965 --> 03:16:21.887]  I'd like to give a plug first for the amazing Redfield Plus.
[03:16:22.047 --> 03:16:25.289]  That combination, whatever you put in that, that formulation, is amazing.
[03:16:25.369 --> 03:16:27.590]  My energy level is just through the ceiling already.
[03:16:27.710 --> 03:16:32.093]  I mean, I've lost about 10 pounds and gained about 15 mass, most mass.
[03:16:32.553 --> 03:16:33.334]  I'm not sure.
[03:16:33.514 --> 03:16:40.658]  I think Real Red Pill was sold out for two plus years because we couldn't get the ingredients in the lockdowns, and I think it's almost sold out or is about to sell out.
[03:16:40.698 --> 03:16:42.819]  Yeah, that's, I mean, I'm not hyping any of these products.
[03:16:42.839 --> 03:16:47.882]  They're all amazing, but Real Red Pill takes a few weeks to kick in, but once it kicks in, it is just incredible.
[03:16:47.902 --> 03:16:50.503]  Gotta take it every day for a couple weeks, and then you're like, whoa, it's amazing.
[03:16:50.783 --> 03:16:51.303]  Exactly.
[03:16:51.403 --> 03:16:52.284]  It didn't really hit me.
[03:16:52.384 --> 03:16:54.084]  Like, I thought it would be like a pep pill.
[03:16:54.184 --> 03:16:57.905]  You know, like, if I'm not going to take some coffee with me, I'll just take this Real Red Pill Plus.
[03:16:57.965 --> 03:16:59.185]  But it didn't kick in like that.
[03:16:59.305 --> 03:17:03.927]  It waited for, like, about four or five days, and then I just started feeling this surge.
[03:17:04.247 --> 03:17:04.987]  So it's good stuff.
[03:17:05.047 --> 03:17:07.648]  I hope you guys can keep it on sale, or at least available.
[03:17:07.688 --> 03:17:08.948]  But look at Real Red Pill Plus.
[03:17:08.988 --> 03:17:10.689]  It still is in stock, almost sold out.
[03:17:10.709 --> 03:17:14.170]  4.9 star reviews right there.
[03:17:15.968 --> 03:17:17.813]  Everybody should take Real Red Bull Plus.
[03:17:17.833 --> 03:17:19.578]  In fact, it's discounted right now.
[03:17:19.638 --> 03:17:22.647]  It is an amazing, amazing product, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:17:23.534 --> 03:17:24.735]  And so, absolutely, everybody should take it.
[03:17:24.996 --> 03:17:29.879]  Yeah, it's got natural green tea and herbamonte and, you know, natural stimulants, so you feel it the first day.
[03:17:29.919 --> 03:17:31.661]  But that's just a little added kick.
[03:17:31.701 --> 03:17:32.622]  That's why it's the plus.
[03:17:32.682 --> 03:17:38.947]  It's the preglanone and the key amino acids and stuff that, for most people, are deficient in preglanone, even though they're young.
[03:17:39.087 --> 03:17:42.710]  It helps your body create hormones to counter all the fake hormones we're being bombarded with.
[03:17:42.910 --> 03:17:45.792]  Everybody needs to get Real Red Pill Plus at InfoWarstore.com.
[03:17:45.832 --> 03:17:49.595]  It's just as important as Nitric Boost or as the X2 and X3 products.
[03:17:49.715 --> 03:17:50.676]  All of it is synergy.
[03:17:50.696 --> 03:17:52.818]  When I forget to take them, I just kick myself.
[03:17:53.555 --> 03:17:55.555]  Because they work so well.
[03:17:55.555 --> 03:17:57.555]  [Water Splashing]
[03:17:57.555 --> 03:17:59.555]  [Water Splashing]
[03:17:59.555 --> 03:18:01.555]  [Water Splashing]
[03:18:01.555 --> 03:18:03.555]  [Water Splashing]
[03:18:03.555 --> 03:18:05.555]  [Water Splashing]
[03:18:05.555 --> 03:18:07.555]  [Water Splashing]
[03:18:07.555 --> 03:18:09.555]  [Water Splashing]
[03:18:09.555 --> 03:18:11.555]  [Water Splashing]
[03:18:11.555 --> 03:18:13.555]  Everybody run down around here.
[03:18:12.583 --> 03:18:17.568]  I want to thank Alex Jones and InfoWars for offering scholarships to River University.

[03:19:14.285 --> 03:19:15.866]  First off, gay people are awesome.
[03:19:16.026 --> 03:19:17.427]  I don't think that's a problem at all.
[03:19:17.847 --> 03:19:22.730]  And secondly, if you noticed at the end of that video, he advertises water filters.
[03:19:24.210 --> 03:19:24.631]  Interesting.
[03:19:25.231 --> 03:19:30.333]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[03:19:32.665 --> 03:19:34.226]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[03:19:34.266 --> 03:19:34.867]  It's a good thing.
[03:19:34.907 --> 03:19:38.109]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[03:19:38.669 --> 03:19:41.011]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[03:19:41.051 --> 03:19:42.192]  I learned what the best was.
[03:19:42.872 --> 03:19:56.122]  An Alexa Pure family of stainless steel gravity filters take the already decent and good systems that were out there and took it to the next level of quality, durability, customer service, replacement filters, you name it.

[03:20:25.440 --> 03:20:27.022]  Do you understand that?
