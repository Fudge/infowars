[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:07.033]  I put up the show headline this morning, Victory Within Grasp, Humanity is Awakening to the Globalist Occupation of Earth, Must Watch, Friday Live Broadcast.
[00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:10.234]  Please share the links from Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[00:00:11.195 --> 00:00:16.177]  But when you try to share those links, a lot of them get blocked.
[00:00:16.578 --> 00:00:24.920]   So we have a page that's just a static page that is Forget the new URL, let's put it back on screen guys.
[00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:29.045]  I think that's conspiracyfact.info.
[00:00:29.665 --> 00:00:37.515]  So just be sure and share that link or figure out however creatively you can because we are in an information war.
[00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:42.159]  And it is essential in the information war to get those facts out.
[00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:46.022]  In fact, pull up conspiracyfact.info for me right now.
[00:00:46.763 --> 00:00:59.814]  And more and more we're just going to build separate sites, because every few months they'll ban the next site, that just have the simple video and audio players for the show for you, so you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, in person, everywhere else.
[00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:11.905]  Go ahead and scroll down and then find the live feed for your friends, family, neighbors, perfect strangers, whoever it is that you want to share that information with.
[00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:13.106]  Hey, here's a forbidden link.
[00:01:13.527 --> 00:01:15.228]  Here's information they don't want you to know.
[00:01:15.668 --> 00:01:18.471]  The people are very, very hungry for the truth.
[00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:20.633]  And again, it's a simple thing.
[00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:21.554]  Everybody understands it.
[00:01:21.594 --> 00:01:25.937]  But if we don't share the word, we can't overpower the sensors and the control.
[00:01:26.698 --> 00:01:40.124]  They don't have big tech and legacy dinosaur media and the FBI and the CIA and the Justice Department, the Pentagon, trying to suppress the American people, criticizing Bill Gates, criticizing election fraud, criticizing open borders for nothing.
[00:01:40.544 --> 00:01:43.486]  We're winning hearts and minds and have a good chance of beating this.
[00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:47.688]  But people have to realize how critical and important they individually are.
[00:01:48.048 --> 00:01:52.150]  So conspiracy fact on info is the current URL to share.
[00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.991]  And it's still from that fundraiser a few weeks ago has some headlines.
[00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.670]   headlines about money bomb. We're going to update that to say live Alex Jones broadcast.
[00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.350]  That's a very simple, easy page for everybody to share.
[00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:15.349]   Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:31.350]   Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh, relying on unnamed national security
[00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.950]   sources recently published an article on his substack about the destruction of the Nord
[00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.229]  stream pipelines.
[00:02:38.876 --> 00:02:46.978]  Two pipelines, known as Nord Stream 1, provided Western Europe with cheap Russian gas for more than a decade.
[00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:51.539]  These pipelines were seen by NATO as a threat to Western dominance.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.982]  Profits were shared with the Russian government and provided up to 45% of their annual budget.
[00:02:58.642 --> 00:03:04.464]  A second pair, called Nord Stream 2, had been built but were not yet operational.
[00:03:05.064 --> 00:03:15.753]  NATO was concerned that as long as Europe remained dependent upon these pipelines, Germany would be reluctant to supply Ukraine with money and weapons to fight Russia.
[00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:30.024]  And so the Biden administration authorized Jake Sullivan to assemble a task force with members of the Biden White House, the CIA, and the Pentagon to come up with a plan for the destruction of the pipelines.
[00:03:30.684 --> 00:03:35.747]  The operation was run by Victoria Newland, Anthony Blinken, and Jake Sullivan.
[00:03:36.348 --> 00:03:40.650]  The Navy proposed using a submarine to assault the pipeline directly.
[00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.833]  The Air Force proposed dropping bombs with delayed fuses.
[00:03:45.373 --> 00:03:49.836]  And the CIA argued that whatever was done, it would have to be covert.
[00:03:50.356 --> 00:03:54.619]  Because if the attack was traced to the U.S., then it would be an act of war.
[00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:08.762]  In early 2022, right after the CIA reported to Sullivan that they had a plan, both Victoria Nuland and President Biden publicly threatened to bring an end to Nord Stream 2.
[00:04:09.222 --> 00:04:15.784]  If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.
[00:04:16.484 --> 00:04:25.348]  If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again.
[00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.691]  Then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.
[00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:44.978]  According to the source, this public announcement meant that blowing up the pipeline no longer could be considered a covert option, and that there was no longer a legal requirement to report their plans to Congress.
[00:04:45.938 --> 00:04:56.883]  The Americans partnered with Norway, who had their own motivations for the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines, which would allow them to sell more of their own natural gas to Europe.
[00:04:57.604 --> 00:05:04.247]  In March of 2022, members of the team flew to Norway to meet with the Norwegian Secret Service.
[00:05:05.007 --> 00:05:24.547]  The Norwegian Navy decided on a spot in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, a few miles off Denmark's Bornholm Island, where the divers, operating from a Norwegian Alta-class mine hunter, would plant C4 charges with concrete protective covers on the four pipelines.
[00:05:25.448 --> 00:05:27.470]  Divers were chosen from the U.S.
[00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:46.089]  Navy's Diving and Salvage Center in Panama City, which specializes in training deepwater divers to use C-4 explosives, because they were Navy only and not members of America's Special Operations Command, whose covert operations would need to be reported to Congress.
[00:05:46.790 --> 00:06:07.703]   The mission was secretly embedded into an annual training exercise already scheduled for June of 2022, known as Baltic Operations 22, or BALTOPS 22, wherein the Panama City divers would place C4 explosives With a 48-hour timer attached.
[00:06:08.183 --> 00:06:19.349]  But the White House then worried that triggering the explosion within two days of the well-publicized training exercise would make it obvious that America was responsible.
[00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:26.633]  And so it was decided that the C-4 would be triggered by a sonar buoy, later dropped by plane.
[00:06:27.313 --> 00:06:33.717]  The buoy would emit a sequence of unique low-frequency tonal sounds to trigger the explosives.
[00:06:34.717 --> 00:06:43.361]  On September 26th, 2022, a Norwegian Navy P-8 surveillance plane dropped the sonar buoy.
[00:06:43.741 --> 00:06:53.386]  The signal spread underwater, and a few hours later, the high-powered explosives were triggered and three of the four pipelines were put out of commission.
[00:06:54.162 --> 00:06:58.883]  According to Hersh's national security sources, it was a beautiful cover story.
[00:06:59.344 --> 00:07:06.746]  It was a covert operation that placed experts in the field and equipment that operated on a covert signal.
[00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:09.807]  The only flaw was the decision to do it.
[00:07:10.707 --> 00:07:13.188]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:07:14.008 --> 00:07:17.209]  Big Friday show going live now, now, now!
[00:07:18.775 --> 00:07:22.057]  All right, I am completely overwhelmed in a crazy way.
[00:07:22.438 --> 00:07:25.920]  I mean, the news is all just so over the top, so insane.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:32.345]  The global awakening is so massive and so positive, but the New World Order is just doubling and tripling down.
[00:07:32.865 --> 00:07:38.269]  There's no way to even properly cover a tenth of this, but I'm going to do my best today.
[00:07:39.594 --> 00:07:50.217]  And we have Josh Alexander, who is a high school student arrested in Canada because he did not worship transgenderism and take part in the school.
[00:07:50.417 --> 00:07:53.018]  I mean, this is the global cult, the total control.
[00:07:53.058 --> 00:07:58.520]  They get you to accept that men are women and that men can be in women's bathrooms and things.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.380]  They get you to do anything.
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.620]  He's joining us.
[00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:06.702]  Great reporter Emerald Robinson is going to be joining us to cover the waterfront as well.
[00:08:07.763 --> 00:08:09.043]  And so much more.
[00:08:11.997 --> 00:08:22.627]  So again, thank you so much for joining us on this live Friday, February 10th, 2023 transmission.
[00:08:23.528 --> 00:08:29.074]  Now, I'm just going to read some headlines here in this segment, and I'm not reading these in the order of importance.
[00:08:29.314 --> 00:08:31.116]  I'm just going to give you an idea of how insane things are.
[00:08:32.654 --> 00:08:51.704]  It just broke on Fox News, and this is Fetterman's family confirming this, that it's not a new stroke, he's gone completely insane and hears voices, while he's working in the Senate, that are the Peanuts voices from the Peanut 1960s, 70s, 80s TV show.
[00:08:52.925 --> 00:08:53.545]  I'm not kidding.
[00:08:54.786 --> 00:08:55.186]  Snoopy.
[00:08:57.418 --> 00:09:01.481]  Charlie Brown, all of them, which they should give him the nuclear codes immediately.
[00:09:01.521 --> 00:09:04.443]  He's even more insane than Joe Biden.
[00:09:04.483 --> 00:09:06.424]  So he's the perfect puppet.
[00:09:06.824 --> 00:09:12.908]  Fetterman hears voices like the teachers in Peanuts after Stroke struggles to adjust to Senate life.
[00:09:13.649 --> 00:09:18.392]  And he's in the hospital hearing voices right now and is dizzy and can't stand up.
[00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.050]  Well, that's interesting.
[00:09:22.811 --> 00:09:27.131]  We have a whole stack of news from the incredible last two days of hearings on Twitter and the FBI.
[00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:30.332]  It's just Twitter that the documents came out because Elon Musk released them.
[00:09:30.452 --> 00:09:31.272]  It's all the big tech.
[00:09:32.012 --> 00:09:38.554]  But the FBI colluding with the Southern Poverty Law Center to list hundreds of groups as terrorists.
[00:09:39.234 --> 00:09:41.394]  The FBI is under the command of the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:09:41.954 --> 00:09:45.535]  They've now come out and admitted that they follow the orders of the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:09:46.997 --> 00:09:57.605]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, an offshore criminal organization in my view, directed them to say that conservative Catholics are the main terror threat in America.
[00:09:59.287 --> 00:09:59.987]  Can't make that up.
[00:10:00.888 --> 00:10:09.375]  We also have the videos of House Conference Chair Blass FBI and Democrats for election meddling and weaponization against the American people.
[00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:24.432]  FBI says leaked memo showing they're monitoring radical traditionalist Catholics was not up to their exacting standards, but they were directed to follow it by the Justice Department and President Biden, and that they are given policy by the Southern Primary Law Center and the ADL.
[00:10:25.093 --> 00:10:27.615]  FBI under pressure for targeting Catholics in leaked document.
[00:10:28.905 --> 00:10:32.946]  Reported FBI documents suggest the agency may be targeting Catholics who attend Latin Mass.
[00:10:33.006 --> 00:10:34.266]  Boy, that's so evil.
[00:10:34.826 --> 00:10:35.546]  Horrible people.
[00:10:36.506 --> 00:10:37.726]  Say what you want about Catholics.
[00:10:37.787 --> 00:10:39.527]  The Latin Mass is beautiful.
[00:10:40.847 --> 00:10:43.647]  I've been to a few of them over the years.
[00:10:44.188 --> 00:10:45.308]  And it's very, very pretty.
[00:10:45.968 --> 00:10:51.129]  And even if you're lucky enough to go to one of the churches that has the monks chanting, it's just amazing stuff.
[00:10:51.529 --> 00:10:52.409]  Very dangerous.
[00:10:52.689 --> 00:10:55.109]  Very, very evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.011]   FBI to retract Catholic Infiltration Memo.
[00:11:00.171 --> 00:11:01.151]  They're spying on them.
[00:11:01.691 --> 00:11:04.533]  The FBI's slander of radical traditionalist Catholics.
[00:11:04.573 --> 00:11:05.373]  Another headline there.
[00:11:05.393 --> 00:11:11.536]  FBI retracts leaked document orchestrating investigation of Catholics as the main terror threat.
[00:11:12.236 --> 00:11:21.320]  FBI targeting devout Catholics after whistleblower Kyle Sefferin reports on leaked bureau document warning agents of danger and radical traditionalist Catholic ideology.
[00:11:23.361 --> 00:11:24.182]  Continuing here.
[00:11:24.262 --> 00:11:32.582]   Catholic high school student arrested after Suspension for opposing transgender ideology.
[00:11:32.622 --> 00:11:34.002]  He'll be joining us.
[00:11:34.843 --> 00:11:43.427]  And the war on anybody traditionalist, particularly Christian traditionalists, whether evangelical, Baptist, Catholic, they are coming after you.
[00:11:44.107 --> 00:11:46.428]  Because they're Satanist, folks.
[00:11:46.948 --> 00:11:47.908]  Brought to you by Pfizer.
[00:11:48.349 --> 00:11:53.471]  FBI using discredited SPLC to paint Catholics as extremists.
[00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:55.292]  And we've got all that.
[00:11:56.372 --> 00:11:59.715]  It just goes on and on from there.
[00:11:59.735 --> 00:12:02.597]  And we've got more attempts to arrest people in the U.S.
[00:12:02.617 --> 00:12:05.539]  that don't want their children to be brainwashed in the transgender cult.
[00:12:07.005 --> 00:12:08.546]  We're going to be laying all of that out.
[00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:14.851]  I see these deceptive headlines everywhere that, oh, Tennessee and Texas to pass laws restricting drag shows.
[00:12:14.911 --> 00:12:21.035]  No, men can dress up in dresses and men can go get naked dressed up like women at bars or wherever they want.
[00:12:21.715 --> 00:12:24.838]  You just can't do it with two year olds and then shake your penis in their face.
[00:12:25.918 --> 00:12:26.599]  That's what you can't do.
[00:12:26.959 --> 00:12:27.499]  That's illegal.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:34.044]  And again, how offended would you be if you went to a topless bar to have a drink after work?
[00:12:34.364 --> 00:12:35.005]  You're an adult.
[00:12:35.545 --> 00:12:36.286]  It's what you want to do.
[00:12:37.739 --> 00:12:44.643]  People can judge you or they can't, and then they had three-year-olds, five-year-olds there sticking money in the topless women's g-strings.
[00:12:44.663 --> 00:12:46.123]  You'd call the police, and you should.
[00:12:47.464 --> 00:12:50.586]  But if it's all homosexual, well, we've got to allow that.
[00:12:51.186 --> 00:12:55.268]  And they call it, oh, you're anti-gay, you're anti-freedom, you're anti... No.
[00:12:56.028 --> 00:12:56.989]  Some people can be.
[00:12:57.029 --> 00:12:57.569]  That's their view.
[00:12:57.609 --> 00:12:58.010]  There ought to be.
[00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:02.612]  I'm anti-targeting children, whether you're homosexual, heterosexual, whatever it is.
[00:13:03.012 --> 00:13:04.393]  It's called pedophilia.
[00:13:06.175 --> 00:13:06.816]  So we have that.
[00:13:06.836 --> 00:13:08.439]  We have some powerful videos coming up.
[00:13:08.619 --> 00:13:12.545]  Activist confronts Tennessee Democrats on hearing on sexual mutilation of children.
[00:13:13.891 --> 00:13:16.113]  Very powerful clips on that front.
[00:13:16.133 --> 00:13:29.325]  We obviously have the huge news dealing with the Nord Stream Pipeline being blown up in three spots and Cy Hirsch with internal documents and whistleblowers on exactly who did it and how.
[00:13:29.385 --> 00:13:30.486]  And I guess I was wrong.
[00:13:31.046 --> 00:13:36.211]  I would guess it'd be the Navy SEALs, as I said, when it first had been blown up.
[00:13:36.451 --> 00:13:37.232]  Part of that drill.
[00:13:37.552 --> 00:13:42.032]   But now they're saying that was under the oversight of Congress, so they use regular
[00:13:42.032 --> 00:13:48.351]   Navy demolition divers used for underwater Navy construction to blow it up.
[00:13:48.351 --> 00:13:53.132]   And Hirsch has the witnesses because people in government know this is illegal and they're
[00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:55.132]  doing the right thing.
[00:13:55.132 --> 00:14:00.872]   And now we're learning that they've gone to Congress and that nothing was done.
[00:14:00.872 --> 00:14:03.831]  So they went to Seymour Hirsch.
[00:14:03.842 --> 00:14:06.584]  So we salute him, always doing an incredible job.
[00:14:07.705 --> 00:14:08.565]  That's all coming up.
[00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:22.358]   And then there's more news on this that I've been covering a lot the last few days, but out of anything out there that illustrates how truly evil Joe Biden is and how truly evil the globalist agenda, not
[00:14:22.358 --> 00:14:26.758]   just here, but all the world to drive working class, hardworking families
[00:14:26.758 --> 00:14:33.058]   into welfare and bankruptcy and destruction so the government can monitor and control your life, the social
[00:14:33.058 --> 00:14:34.758]  credit score, the universal basic income.
[00:14:34.758 --> 00:14:42.977]   It's Joe Biden when he first got in over two years ago, directing almost all the agents to not focus on white
[00:14:42.977 --> 00:14:44.758]  collar crime and rich people.
[00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:53.758]   But no matter what you think of the IRS or this constitutional, which obviously isn't 1913, it's all BS.
[00:14:53.855 --> 00:15:05.472]   The point is, is that when you aim the bureaucracy at people making $40,000 or less a year, when they pay less than 6% of the taxes, You're not doing that to raise revenue.
[00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:08.173]  You're doing that to push people over the edge.
[00:15:08.193 --> 00:15:18.119]  I don't know how many people I know who have college degrees who can't get a job and pay their bills, so they do things like mow yards, give massages.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:28.425]  They are good golfers, so they train, you know, golfer pros go out and, hey, I'll give you half price on a golf lesson, you just got to pay me cash.
[00:15:29.085 --> 00:15:35.928]  And they can barely pay their bills, having two or three jobs, two of the jobs they pay taxes on, one of the jobs they don't.
[00:15:36.368 --> 00:15:39.029]  So now the IRS is scaling up tattletale lines.
[00:15:39.609 --> 00:15:46.492]  Oh, we'll give you tens of thousands of dollars if you report a waitress or waiter who keeps those cash tips.
[00:15:49.173 --> 00:15:54.776]  Or, oh, did your neighbor pay the lawn man in cash?
[00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:05.540]  And that's why they want to get rid of cash, because they want to establish the economy where you can't operate and survive as the average person to destroy the idea of capitalism.
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.582]  That's Cloward and Pibben, and that's their mission.
[00:16:07.782 --> 00:16:10.165]  But then Joe Biden's got the nerve, and I'm going to cover this coming up.
[00:16:11.539 --> 00:16:14.362]  Talk about all these billionaires and trillionaires.
[00:16:15.222 --> 00:16:29.375]  They don't pay even 3% tax, which is true, and they're the woke megacorporations that are funding all the leftist garbage and funding the tax code to annihilate little people while they make hundreds of billions of dollars and then fund all this wokeism.
[00:16:30.538 --> 00:16:37.804]  But I just love how the Democrats always talk about going after the ultra-rich, and their idea of the ultra-rich is somebody mowing yards or giving massages.
[00:16:38.584 --> 00:16:39.205]  Or a waitress.
[00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:40.466]  Or a bartender.
[00:16:40.946 --> 00:16:42.808]  Trying to put their kid through school.
[00:16:44.789 --> 00:16:46.070]  It's such a deal-breaker.
[00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.293]  How could any working class person support these people?
[00:16:49.673 --> 00:16:52.075]  And why aren't the Republicans making a bigger deal out of this?
[00:16:53.277 --> 00:16:59.881]  All right, let me talk about a 35,000-foot issue, and then we'll move into ground level here on this live Friday broadcast.
[00:17:00.341 --> 00:17:01.522]  Very thankful you all tuned in.
[00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:02.802]  Very honored to have you here with us.
[00:17:04.603 --> 00:17:07.085]  I put up the show headline this morning, Victory Within Grasp!
[00:17:07.145 --> 00:17:09.426]  Humanity is Awakening to the Globalist Occupation of Earth!
[00:17:09.926 --> 00:17:11.607]  Must watch Friday live broadcast.
[00:17:11.627 --> 00:17:14.729]  Please share the links from BandotVideo and InfoWars.com.
[00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:20.725]  But when you try to share those links, a lot of them get blocked.
[00:17:21.125 --> 00:17:28.348]  So we have a page that's just a static page that is... I forget what the new URL is.
[00:17:28.368 --> 00:17:29.489]  We put it back on screen, guys.
[00:17:30.269 --> 00:17:32.270]  I think that's a conspiracyfact.info.
[00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.590]  Conspiracyfact.info.
[00:17:34.091 --> 00:17:42.074]  And so just be sure and share that link or figure out however creatively you can because we are in an information war.
[00:17:42.874 --> 00:17:46.717]  And it is essential in the information war to get those facts out.
[00:17:47.017 --> 00:17:50.580]  In fact, pull up conspiracyfact.info for me right now.
[00:17:51.321 --> 00:18:04.371]  And more and more we're just going to build separate sites, because every few months they'll ban the next site, that just have the simple video and audio players for the show for you, so you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, in person, everywhere else.
[00:18:05.031 --> 00:18:16.460]  Go ahead and scroll down and then find the live feed for your friends, family, neighbors, perfect strangers, whoever it is that you want to share that information with.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.661]  Hey, here's a forbidden link.
[00:18:18.082 --> 00:18:19.783]  Here's information they don't want you to know.
[00:18:20.223 --> 00:18:23.025]  The people are very, very hungry for the truth.
[00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:25.187]  And again, it's a simple thing.
[00:18:25.287 --> 00:18:26.108]  Everybody understands it.
[00:18:26.148 --> 00:18:30.491]  But if we don't share the word, we can't overpower the sensors and the control.
[00:18:31.272 --> 00:18:44.683]  They don't have big tech and legacy dinosaur media and the FBI and the CIA and the Justice Department and the Pentagon trying to suppress the American people, criticizing Bill Gates, criticizing election fraud, criticizing open borders for nothing.
[00:18:45.104 --> 00:18:48.046]  We're winning hearts and minds to have a good chance of beating this.
[00:18:48.526 --> 00:18:52.249]  But people have to realize how critical and important they individually are.
[00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:56.733]  So conspiracy fact on info is the current URL to share.
[00:18:57.153 --> 00:19:02.885]   And it's still from that fundraiser a few weeks ago has some headlines about money money bomb. We're going to update that and say live Alex
[00:19:02.885 --> 00:19:03.775]  Jones broadcast.
[00:19:03.775 --> 00:19:08.555]  And that's a very simple, easy page for everybody to share.
[00:19:08.555 --> 00:19:11.955]   OK, let me give you the thirty five thousand foot view and then dig back into the news.
[00:19:11.955 --> 00:19:16.315]  If you understand why Biden is.
[00:19:16.315 --> 00:19:22.435]   Assaulting over the last two years and upgrading the assault to just a deluge with
[00:19:22.435 --> 00:19:27.315]   eighty seven thousand new agents that the House voted to repeal the money for, but the
[00:19:27.315 --> 00:19:29.714]  Senate isn't doing it, so it's on the books, it's happening.
[00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:35.695]  The reason they would target people bringing in less than 6% of the revenue is to why?
[00:19:36.116 --> 00:19:41.759]  Get them to give up, go on welfare, go to the system, so the system has a bunch of people that they control.
[00:19:42.628 --> 00:19:48.621]  That they can domesticate, that they can make politically follow their orders, or they don't get to have food.
[00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.892]  And then, you grow up generations in that, which we already have, now it's intensifying.
[00:19:54.412 --> 00:20:08.980]  They have an army of people that are totally domesticated, and don't know how to take care of themselves, who will actually believe somebody that has a nice car, or a decent house, or has a nice education, or can go on vacation, or has good medical care, is bad!
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:18.545]  And that it's that person that didn't pay more taxes, because that person didn't support communism, and authoritarianism, and centralization.
[00:20:19.451 --> 00:20:20.552]  That that's the reason.
[00:20:20.612 --> 00:20:27.235]  If they just got pure corporate communism in, they'd suddenly have all this wealth.
[00:20:28.856 --> 00:20:44.163]  When it's the most rich, powerful, elite corporations on earth, headed up by the Carnegie Endowment and the Rockefeller Foundation, that publicly run our healthcare, publicly run our policy, publicly run everything.
[00:20:44.835 --> 00:20:53.601]  And they're trying to take the world over, and doing all these evil things in our name, while at the same time discrediting America, when this isn't America.
[00:20:54.801 --> 00:20:56.362]  This is a globalist occupied force.
[00:20:56.522 --> 00:21:06.128]  So here's a short clip of Biden, just from yesterday, saying you'd think a trillionaire should be paying at least 3%.
[00:21:06.168 --> 00:21:07.029]  Here it is.
[00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.031]  You think a trillionaire should be paying at 3%?
[00:21:10.591 --> 00:21:11.472]  Look, I'm a capitalist.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:18.982]  If you can make a million or a billion, I said trillion, if you can make a billion or a million dollars, God love you.
[00:21:21.243 --> 00:21:41.429]  But the very corporations, 99% of the Fortune 500 give most of their money to Democrats and create the global policies through the think tanks to have Google and Microsoft and all these other corporations paying, Biden correctly said, less than 3% on average in taxes.
[00:21:43.226 --> 00:21:52.913]  So a working class person making $35,000, $40,000 a year, they are paying after Social Security and all the rest of it around 30%, 25 to 30%.
[00:21:52.752 --> 00:21:58.551]   percent, 25 to 30 percent. Let me tell you, you're making less than $45,000 a
[00:21:58.551 --> 00:22:05.072]  year, you should be paying no taxes at the federal level.
[00:22:03.449 --> 00:22:09.871]  And back when our country was healthier and smarter, there was no tax on working class people and blue collar people.
[00:22:10.271 --> 00:22:11.811]  And there were low taxes on middle class.
[00:22:12.071 --> 00:22:13.592]  That makes a bigger middle class.
[00:22:14.112 --> 00:22:23.394]  But when you raise taxes on the middle class and working class, and then the elites have all these special provisions for themselves, that's how you do what they've done.
[00:22:24.882 --> 00:22:30.547]  In 1950, look it up, America was 4% of the world population.
[00:22:30.567 --> 00:22:32.128]  96% didn't live in the United States of America.
[00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:48.402]  The United States had over half the wealth in the planet, the biggest middle class the world had ever seen, the top 1% only owned about 20% of the wealth and property, and a giant middle class and working class had almost all the rest of it, close to 80%.
[00:22:48.241 --> 00:22:59.442]  to 80%. Today, one-tenth of 1% has over 75% of the wealth.
[00:22:59.442 --> 00:23:09.441]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:23:01.848 --> 00:23:05.871]  And it is a tiny percent of that percent that has over half the wealth.
[00:23:06.131 --> 00:23:12.235]  There are less than 10 families that have over half the wealth in the world.
[00:23:12.555 --> 00:23:13.616]  How did we go since 1950?
[00:23:15.984 --> 00:23:26.970]  With 4% of the world that launched the American system, created a giant wealthy middle class and working class, where now a poor person had more wealth than a rich person had in 1900.
[00:23:28.551 --> 00:23:36.236]  All this wealth, all this splendor, all this stuff that made us so decadent, that's the byproducts that makes you spoiled, makes you lazy, makes your kids lazy, we all know it.
[00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:39.470]  And that's when the corruption sets in.
[00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:45.094]  History shows when you have a powerful, rich country and hard-working people, they have a golden era.
[00:23:45.775 --> 00:23:55.602]  Within a few generations, they got a bunch of spoiled, rotten people that are lazy and stupid on average, and corrupt elites take over, and then the cycle of corruption takes over, and then it's a collapse.
[00:23:56.242 --> 00:24:00.905]  And we're headed into that right now, and the globalists know that cycle, so they're orchestrating it.
[00:24:01.226 --> 00:24:12.520]   So I'm going to say to new listeners, I know our regular listeners know this, But to new listeners out there, if you're a Democrat with two or three college degrees and you think if you bring in communism it's all going to be free, you're an idiot.
[00:24:13.382 --> 00:24:23.119]   The ultra-rich are fascist transhumanists that hate you and have nothing but Revulsion for you.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.880]  They think you're a complete joke.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.561]  Because you buy into this.
[00:24:26.861 --> 00:24:28.862]  You're not going to get black reparations.
[00:24:29.082 --> 00:24:31.203]  You're not going to get your student loans forgiven.
[00:24:31.623 --> 00:24:43.969]  They dangle that out in front of you while they hire 87,000 IRS agents after two years of raping poor people, the working poor and the blue-collar people above them.
[00:24:46.096 --> 00:24:47.336]  to destroy you.
[00:24:47.336 --> 00:24:53.816]   And then you'll get your little EBT card and live in a project full of crime and death
[00:24:53.816 --> 00:24:57.477]  and barely even have enough money to eat food.
[00:24:57.477 --> 00:24:59.497]  They want you out of the game.
[00:24:59.497 --> 00:25:01.997]  They want you enslaved.
[00:25:01.997 --> 00:25:09.615]   And it's the Fortune 500 controlled by the Fortune 100 that are publicly running all of these policies worldwide,
[00:25:09.615 --> 00:25:14.997]   the same policies in Australia, better in France, better in the UK, better in the US,
[00:25:14.997 --> 00:25:17.237]  because it's the new world order.
[00:25:17.328 --> 00:25:23.690]  And anything they push will bring you poverty and death and enslavement and war and destruction.
[00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:25.671]  You have to reject everything they do.
[00:25:26.866 --> 00:25:35.816]  And get back to the American system that in 1950 had the American people having half the wealth of the world that we produced that made others rich!
[00:25:37.168 --> 00:25:40.070]  The tyrants are attacking reading, writing, and arithmetic.
[00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:41.451]  They're attacking logic.
[00:25:41.871 --> 00:25:43.092]  They're attacking science.
[00:25:43.132 --> 00:25:44.393]  They're attacking common sense.
[00:25:44.833 --> 00:25:58.082]  They're putting slaves, brainwashed, dumbed down, addled people in positions of power so that you think it's Joe Biden and you think it's Senator Federman running things when it is the big globalist think tanks that are running it all.
[00:25:58.642 --> 00:26:17.317]   But the beautiful good news Is the nonsense here, but all over the world, folks are finding out about multinational corporations writing policy using executive branches through intelligence agencies and think tanks and media and big tech to suppress and control and dumb down the public.
[00:26:17.837 --> 00:26:21.479]  And Twitter was a big test of their power and control.
[00:26:22.439 --> 00:26:46.261]   So I've been telling you this for many years, but you have big tech, dinosaur media, think tanks that create policy And then the organizations that create the targeting policy, the ADL and Southern Primary Law Center, that is then given over to big tech and legacy media and federal law enforcement, not just here but in every western country, it's the same blueprint where they have consoles.
[00:26:47.182 --> 00:26:53.184]  As I've told you hundreds of times the last eight, nine years, when we learned the specifics of this, to all go into your file.
[00:26:53.244 --> 00:26:55.904]  They can read your private text messages without a warrant.
[00:26:56.485 --> 00:26:58.025]  They can track everything you're doing.
[00:26:58.065 --> 00:26:59.105]  They read your email.
[00:26:59.485 --> 00:27:03.307]  They read your private Twitter, your Facebook, your Instagram, your Google search.
[00:27:03.907 --> 00:27:08.208]  That has been given access to millions alone in the U.S.
[00:27:08.648 --> 00:27:11.589]  of private and governmental bureaucrats.
[00:27:12.523 --> 00:27:49.995]   And that was what's so amazing about the last two days of hearings that I could do the whole show just on these in Congress where they've got just the documents from Twitter where they create a console for each platform that government agencies without warrants who put former FBI agents and CIA and others in the offices at Twitter which is done everywhere else but we have the Twitter files To then in live time go in and spy on you and they give national security secret and top secret clearances to thousands of people per big tech company.
[00:27:52.055 --> 00:27:56.456]  And of course it's top secret because just like blowing up the gas pipeline, it's illegal.
[00:27:59.517 --> 00:28:08.426]   You see this congressional oversight over Army special operations, Navy special warfare, but there's not over the general Programs.
[00:28:09.146 --> 00:28:18.093]  And so they bring in contractors, they bring in outside construction teams, then they give them military training and they go blow up the pipeline.
[00:28:19.534 --> 00:28:20.135]  As we now know.
[00:28:21.315 --> 00:28:22.316]  So they're outsourcing it.
[00:28:22.336 --> 00:28:46.079]   There's a big article out of the UK where you read it, you go, oh my gosh, the government agency that's over domestic surveillance, Commissioner, Admits illegal spying on everyone in live time and says private corporations are doing it and there's nothing they can do because the government set them up in that position because big tech is the deep state.
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:53.642]  And then government can say oh it's big tech and big tech can say oh it's the government but it's all a revolving door.
[00:28:55.363 --> 00:28:59.544]  So I got a bunch of new clips today but I want to go to a clip I didn't get to yesterday because it's so important.
[00:28:59.564 --> 00:29:09.436]   Representative Anna Paulina Luma, Grills former Twitter exec, Yole Roth, and she's got a map and details how this works.
[00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:10.797]  Here it is.
[00:29:10.837 --> 00:29:16.259]  Mr. Roth, have you communicated with government officials ever on a platform called JIRA?
[00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:18.680]  Yes or no?
[00:29:21.381 --> 00:29:21.961]  Real quick answer.
[00:29:21.981 --> 00:29:22.581]  We're on the clock.
[00:29:22.601 --> 00:29:23.942]  Not to the best of my recollection.
[00:29:23.982 --> 00:29:24.742]  Not to your recollection?
[00:29:24.862 --> 00:29:25.102]  Great.
[00:29:26.142 --> 00:29:30.044]  If you did in the event communicate, who would have had access to this platform?
[00:29:32.145 --> 00:29:33.587]  That's the nature of my confusion.
[00:29:33.607 --> 00:29:34.168]  Okay.
[00:29:34.208 --> 00:29:38.754]  Did you ever speak to government officials on JIRA regarding taking down social media posts?
[00:29:39.588 --> 00:29:41.168]  Again, not to the best of my recollection.
[00:29:41.248 --> 00:29:52.732]  Can you explain to me why the federal government would ever have interest in communicating through JIRA, mind you, a private cloud server, with social media companies without oversight to censor American voices?
[00:29:52.812 --> 00:30:00.314]  I want to let you know that this is a violation of the First Amendment, and the federal government is colluding with social media companies to censor Americans.
[00:30:00.354 --> 00:30:07.576]  Mr. Chairman, I ask for unanimous consent to submit these graphics into record, and Mr. Roth, I'm going to refresh your memory for you.
[00:30:08.076 --> 00:30:08.916]  This flowchart...
[00:30:10.037 --> 00:30:11.037]  Thank you, Chair.
[00:30:11.037 --> 00:30:15.836]   This flowchart shows the following federal agencies, social media companies, Twitter,
[00:30:15.836 --> 00:30:22.356]   leftist nonprofits, and organizations communicating regarding their version of misinformation
[00:30:22.356 --> 00:30:25.197]  using JIRA, a private cloud server.
[00:30:25.197 --> 00:30:28.875]   On this chart, I want to annotate that the Department of Homeland Security, which has
[00:30:28.875 --> 00:30:33.596]   the following branches, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, also known
[00:30:33.596 --> 00:30:39.875]   as CISA, Countering Foreign Intelligence Task Force, now known as the Misinfo, Disinfo,
[00:30:39.875 --> 00:30:43.317]  Malinformation MDM.
[00:30:41.892 --> 00:30:44.033]  This was again used against the American people.
[00:30:44.113 --> 00:31:04.206]  The Election Integrity Partnership, EIP, which includes the following Stanford Internet Observatory, University of Washington Center for Informed Public, Grafica, and Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, and potentially, according to what we found on the final report by EIP, the DNC.
[00:31:05.126 --> 00:31:09.709]  The Center for Internet Security, CIS, a non-profit funded by DHS.
[00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:14.113]  The National Association of Secretaries of State, also known as NASS.
[00:31:14.533 --> 00:31:18.716]  And the National Association of State Election Directors, NASED.
[00:31:19.116 --> 00:31:23.720]  And in this case, because there are other social media companies involved, Twitter.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.581]  What do all of these groups have in common?
[00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:28.261]  And I'm going to again refresh your memory.
[00:31:28.661 --> 00:31:32.002]  They were all communicating on a private cloud server known as JIRA.
[00:31:32.042 --> 00:31:51.748]  Now the screenshot behind me, which is an example of one of thousands, shows on November 3rd, 2020, that you, Mr. Roth, a Twitter employee, were exchanging communications on JIRA, a private cloud server, with CISA, NASS, NASED, and Alex Stamos, who are now working... Oh, pause.
[00:31:51.788 --> 00:31:52.348]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[00:31:53.444 --> 00:32:16.534]  Now, you can look this up, but there's at least 10 federal laws that I know of, and I was looking at it this morning to remind myself, there was a couple laws, there's like 10, that any official government business has to be conducted on government software, government platforms, and it's subject to reporting by law to the Freedom of Information Act system, or the FOIA.
[00:32:17.574 --> 00:32:18.595]  So that right there is a crime.
[00:32:19.517 --> 00:32:37.604]  But to have the FBI and all these groups quarterbacking, targeting people in an election, and that came out in the hearings, to suppress all these stories exposing the Democrats, and the DNC is telling all these think tanks and private groups and government what they want shut down, they then gin up the propaganda of the program, and then have their minions go out and shut it down.
[00:32:38.905 --> 00:32:40.365]  I mean, that's illegal as hell!
[00:32:40.646 --> 00:32:48.869]  That's an informational coup, a weaponized, hijacked federal government, by private interest, with the leftist ideology, over America.
[00:32:49.696 --> 00:32:57.919]  So the big awakening is, you live in an occupied country, whether you're in Australia, or New Zealand, or Canada, or France, or the U.S.
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.581]  This is all illegal as hell, and this is why they think you're so dumb.
[00:33:02.601 --> 00:33:05.062]  Remember the hearings the last ten years?
[00:33:05.362 --> 00:33:10.804]  I was even at one, four years ago, with Sundar Pichai, the head of Google.
[00:33:11.504 --> 00:33:15.386]  And they said again, does Google track people in live time on their phone?
[00:33:15.726 --> 00:33:17.107]  He goes, no sir, we don't.
[00:33:17.647 --> 00:33:18.127]  Total lie.
[00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:23.538]  But the Geospatial Center merge of Google does, so he uses little technicals on him, see?
[00:33:24.699 --> 00:33:30.961]  They have no respect for Congress, because the congressmen still don't even know about GPS systems.
[00:33:33.461 --> 00:33:35.142]  But, they're waking up fast.
[00:33:35.182 --> 00:33:35.642]  Let's continue.
[00:33:36.276 --> 00:33:43.276]   a Twitter employee were exchanging communications on JIRA, a private cloud server, with CISA,
[00:33:43.276 --> 00:33:51.676]   NASS, NASED, and Alex Stambas, who now works at Stanford and is a former security officer
[00:33:51.676 --> 00:33:54.276]  at Facebook, to remove a posting.
[00:33:54.276 --> 00:34:01.955]   Do you now remember communicating on a private cloud server to remove a posting?
[00:34:01.955 --> 00:34:03.634]  Yes or no?
[00:34:03.634 --> 00:34:08.155]   I wouldn't agree with the characterization that this is your stuff.
[00:34:08.519 --> 00:34:10.419]  Back it up 20 seconds, we're going to go to break and come back with this.
[00:34:10.459 --> 00:34:17.641]  Folks, this young, amazing, smart woman, new member of Congress, understands technology.
[00:34:17.942 --> 00:34:19.362]  She's got all these documents that are public.
[00:34:19.962 --> 00:34:21.863]  And so he says, I don't know what that is.
[00:34:22.143 --> 00:34:24.824]  She has his messages on it.
[00:34:27.645 --> 00:34:30.205]  That's called nailing someone.
[00:34:30.866 --> 00:34:31.566]  Nailing them.
[00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.851]  Absolutely nailing his ass.
[00:34:40.292 --> 00:34:44.333]  And I got clips of the FBI being confronted, and trying to lie about it, then being confronted with the documents.
[00:34:44.373 --> 00:34:49.235]  I mean, it's just a smorgasbord of the New World Order being burned down in front of us.
[00:34:49.935 --> 00:34:52.036]  So, ha ha ha ha!
[00:34:52.576 --> 00:34:53.376]  Woo!
[00:34:54.317 --> 00:34:57.838]  This is good, good, good stuff for the future of our species.
[00:34:58.958 --> 00:34:59.979]  And you go get them, girl.
[00:34:59.999 --> 00:35:00.579]  We'll be right back.
[00:35:02.076 --> 00:35:06.658]  But the good news is, now everybody knows we can start turning this thing around.
[00:35:07.459 --> 00:35:09.040]  That's how the cycles work.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.141]  As everybody knows.
[00:35:13.782 --> 00:35:15.221]  Everybody knows.
[00:35:15.221 --> 00:35:25.461]  The captain lied.
[00:35:25.461 --> 00:35:35.461]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:35:27.469 --> 00:35:29.010]  Alright, so let's get back to this incredible clip.
[00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.090]  There's just hours of these.
[00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:31.111]  Representative Anna.
[00:35:32.438 --> 00:35:46.803]  Paulina Luna, I tell you, really taking it to the head censor who had national security clearance highest levels with the FBI inside Twitter, quarterbacking this.
[00:35:46.843 --> 00:35:48.963]  He just told her he doesn't even know about any of this, never heard of this.
[00:35:49.423 --> 00:35:55.565]  She hits him with the internal communications that Elon Musk has released and he goes, oh, well, don't misrepresent me.
[00:35:55.585 --> 00:35:57.206]  Let's continue with that.
[00:35:58.575 --> 00:36:02.837]  Do you now remember communicating on a private cloud server to remove a posting?
[00:36:06.158 --> 00:36:06.638]  Yes or no?
[00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:10.200]  I wouldn't agree with the characterization.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:11.540]  I don't care if you agree.
[00:36:11.741 --> 00:36:12.581]  This is your stuff.
[00:36:12.941 --> 00:36:19.384]  Yes or no, did you communicate with a private entity, the government agency, on a private cloud server, yes or no?
[00:36:20.282 --> 00:36:22.003]  The question was if I could... Yes or no?
[00:36:22.343 --> 00:36:22.804]  I'm on time.
[00:36:22.844 --> 00:36:23.224]  Yes or no?
[00:36:23.624 --> 00:36:25.305]  Ma'am, I don't believe I can give you a yes or no.
[00:36:25.325 --> 00:36:27.927]  Well, I'm going to tell you right now that you did, and we have proof of it.
[00:36:28.387 --> 00:36:34.831]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is joint action between the federal government and a private company to censor and violate the First Amendment.
[00:36:34.871 --> 00:36:39.554]  This is also known, and I'm so glad that there's many attorneys on this panel, joint state actors.
[00:36:39.774 --> 00:36:40.715]  It's highly illegal.
[00:36:41.075 --> 00:36:45.618]  You are all engaged in this action, and I want you to know that you will be all held accountable.
[00:36:46.741 --> 00:36:50.257]  Miss Gaddy, are you still on CISA's Cyber Security Advisory Council?
[00:36:51.744 --> 00:36:52.244]  Yes or no?
[00:36:52.765 --> 00:36:53.205]  Yes I am.
[00:36:53.625 --> 00:36:53.906]  Okay.
[00:36:54.426 --> 00:37:03.433]  For those who have said that this is a pointless hearing, and I just want to let you guys all know, we found that Twitter was indeed communicating with the federal government to censor Americans.
[00:37:03.513 --> 00:37:07.476]  I'd like to remind you that this was all in place before January 6th.
[00:37:07.656 --> 00:37:16.543]  So to say that these mechanisms weren't in place, and to make it about January 6th, I want to let you know that you guys were actually in control of all of the content, and clearly we have proof of that.
[00:37:17.023 --> 00:37:24.049]  Now, if you don't think that this is important to your constituents and the American people from those saying that this was a pointless hearing, I suggest you find other jobs.
[00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:25.110]  Chairman, I yield my time.
[00:37:27.171 --> 00:37:31.055]  By the way, I have some breaking news that I've sat on for a few weeks.
[00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:38.941]  I don't normally sit on stories, but I wanted to get the green light to talk about it concerning January 6th because it's so big.
[00:37:40.603 --> 00:37:51.022]   And I also wanted to just give it to Tucker Carlson, but the sources The guy that gave me the information told me to hold off.
[00:37:51.662 --> 00:38:03.211]  I was supposed to call them back yesterday and I didn't, but let's just say they're inside the Proud Boys trial in DC where the jury's out of the room most of the time.
[00:38:05.473 --> 00:38:09.316]  And it's incredible.
[00:38:10.677 --> 00:38:23.041]   I mean, smoking gun of hundreds of federal informants leading the attack And actually being the leaders of the Proud Boys.
[00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:25.603]  You know, Tarrio was a federal informant.
[00:38:25.623 --> 00:38:26.103]  That's admitted.
[00:38:26.564 --> 00:38:27.725]  He got set up by him, though.
[00:38:29.006 --> 00:38:36.672]  But the people right under him and the driver and all of it was a deep state operation.
[00:38:36.712 --> 00:38:38.034]  These guys got totally set up.
[00:38:38.434 --> 00:38:44.379]  And the judges in the trial, with everybody kicked out of the room, saying to the feds, no, you're right.
[00:38:44.399 --> 00:38:45.280]  We're not letting that out.
[00:38:47.677 --> 00:39:02.025]  So I just went ahead and let the cat out of the bag, because I'm not going to sit on it, and I've been sitting on it too long because it's so big, you're like, that one story is like a Seymour Hersh level deal, six month investigation and all the proof and the facts and the insiders, and that's just my daily life, just like bam, bam, bam, bam.
[00:39:03.826 --> 00:39:10.370]  So I'm not complaining, I'm just saying, I'm busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.
[00:39:11.071 --> 00:39:13.252]  Or I'm busier than a one-armed paper hanger.
[00:39:14.526 --> 00:39:17.929]  And believe me, this is from inside the trial.
[00:39:20.731 --> 00:39:22.313]  And they're just suppressing the hell out of it.
[00:39:26.716 --> 00:39:33.202]  But you talk about vindicating us, and Tucker Carlson talked about this.
[00:39:33.362 --> 00:39:34.583]  I gotta call Tucker after the show.
[00:39:34.683 --> 00:39:36.545]  I gotta put him in touch with these sources.
[00:39:37.105 --> 00:39:37.766]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:39:40.327 --> 00:39:42.888]  And remember, people pay dear prices for covering this.
[00:39:43.648 --> 00:39:44.548]  Let's play this clip.
[00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:51.711]  This is Congressman Clay Higgins, Louisiana, pointing out these criminals will be held accountable for what they've done.
[00:39:52.091 --> 00:39:59.513]  Election meddling, election stealing, admitted by suppressing information and spying on people politically for the DNC at Twitter.
[00:39:59.533 --> 00:39:59.834]  Here it is.
[00:40:04.085 --> 00:40:08.946]  Bottom line is that the FBI had the Biden crime family laptop for a year.
[00:40:09.586 --> 00:40:10.766]  They knew it was leaking.
[00:40:11.046 --> 00:40:13.287]  They knew it would hurt the Biden campaign.
[00:40:14.947 --> 00:40:25.709]  So the FBI used its relationship with Twitter to suppress criminal evidence being revealed about Joe Biden one month before the 2020 elections.
[00:40:27.429 --> 00:40:33.190]  You, ladies and gentlemen, interfered with the United States of America 2020 presidential election.
[00:40:33.777 --> 00:40:34.997]  Knowingly and willingly.
[00:40:35.697 --> 00:40:36.778]  That's the bad news.
[00:40:36.838 --> 00:40:37.778]  It's going to get worse.
[00:40:38.498 --> 00:40:40.658]  Because this is the investigation part.
[00:40:41.118 --> 00:40:42.899]  Later comes the arrest part.
[00:40:44.779 --> 00:40:46.419]  Your attorneys are familiar with that.
[00:40:47.659 --> 00:40:54.180]  Mr. Chairman, I'd like to spend five hours with these ladies and gentlemen doing depositions, surely yet to come.
[00:40:54.501 --> 00:40:58.441]  But for right now, I yield the balance of my time to my colleague, Mr. Jordan.
[00:41:01.282 --> 00:41:03.102]  America's not going to be killed so easily.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.581]  So the globalists are panicking trying to start World War 3.
[00:41:07.441 --> 00:41:08.322]  I'm getting chills right now.
[00:41:08.982 --> 00:41:10.683]  I've got dozens more of these clips.
[00:41:10.723 --> 00:41:12.004]  We've got a guest coming on in 30 minutes.
[00:41:12.224 --> 00:41:15.986]  Arrested in Canada for not submitting to transgender brainwashing in his high school.
[00:41:16.746 --> 00:41:17.727]  And that ties into all this.
[00:41:17.747 --> 00:41:22.769]  Then we'll continue on with these clips and news and Emerald Robinson and more today.
[00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.590]  But listen.
[00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:26.311]  You want somebody to fight?
[00:41:28.732 --> 00:41:29.393]  I'm ready to fight.
[00:41:29.573 --> 00:41:30.273]  I was born to fight.
[00:41:32.314 --> 00:41:33.915]  I don't always win, but I don't ever give up.
[00:41:35.151 --> 00:41:39.256]  I want to salute and thank the viewers and listeners for your support, but this is such a no-brainer.
[00:41:39.676 --> 00:41:49.948]  We've got products you need that'll enrich your life and make it better, and your family's life, and your friends' life, and strangers' lives, and we have been proven right in Triplicate.
[00:41:51.089 --> 00:41:53.172]  And we've held on through all this hell.
[00:41:54.417 --> 00:42:05.404]  To be vindicated now, and I'm not controlled by a board or an outside group like James O'Keefe, who's an amazing person, and I held my fire yesterday until I talked to everybody and found out.
[00:42:05.424 --> 00:42:18.532]  100% Democrat, deep state, CNN infiltrators, after the Pfizer thing, the FBI came in and threatened a bunch of them with arrest, and the board got scared, so they fired James O'Keefe, they've removed him, because the Pfizer thing was the biggest thing they ever did.
[00:42:18.572 --> 00:42:23.215]  I mean, that blew a big, giant hole in the New World Order ship of lies.
[00:42:25.595 --> 00:42:37.462]  That video that came out two weeks ago with their head of global vaccine, MRNA, saying, we created the virus, we did all this, and we're going to take control with it, and we're hurting a bunch of people.
[00:42:39.944 --> 00:42:46.508]  The FBI has already raided Project Veritas several times, and they told him, we're going to arrest your ass if you don't get rid of James O'Keefe.
[00:42:46.988 --> 00:42:54.033]  And the word is they're getting ready to indict O'Keefe with a diary that he didn't even publish.
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:59.943]  With Biden's daughter saying he used to rape me in the shower.
[00:43:02.865 --> 00:43:06.768]  We have a rogue Justice Department that works for the globalists that are CHICOM controlled.
[00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:11.671]  That's where we're at.
[00:43:12.671 --> 00:43:15.673]  And you can see the deep state losing, but they're not giving up.
[00:43:16.154 --> 00:43:20.036]  Don't you see the intelligence agencies release the Nord Stream blow up?
[00:43:20.356 --> 00:43:21.357]  More is going to come out.
[00:43:21.457 --> 00:43:26.363]   Elon Musk is a Opportunist, really smart, but he knows we're winning.
[00:43:26.623 --> 00:43:28.064]  He already jumped over to our side.
[00:43:29.004 --> 00:43:37.987]  More of you that serve the New World Order should just jump over to our side because we're gonna win and we want prosperity and we don't want to blow the planet up.
[00:43:38.387 --> 00:43:40.788]  Will you please just join us?
[00:43:41.068 --> 00:43:42.588]  My God, it's the only move.
[00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:46.430]  I'll put my hand out again to the establishment people that serve the system.
[00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.931]  When you know the ship's sinking, as I've done so many times, just take my hand.
[00:43:53.137 --> 00:43:53.557]  Come on!
[00:43:54.659 --> 00:43:59.083]  You don't have to keep pretending like Mitt Romney, you're part of the power structure, when the whole thing's sinking.
[00:43:59.683 --> 00:44:00.584]  Don't be a Mitt Romney.
[00:44:01.705 --> 00:44:04.088]  Now, I don't just extend sales like, oh, today's the last day.
[00:44:04.148 --> 00:44:04.888]  I've been too busy.
[00:44:05.871 --> 00:44:09.074]  And we're out of so much product that when this sale ends, I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:44:09.795 --> 00:44:11.096]  So I've been so busy.
[00:44:11.156 --> 00:44:13.678]  I haven't cut new ads and I haven't figured out what the new sale will be.
[00:44:13.718 --> 00:44:16.340]  But we've got the biggest sale we ever run in a year running right now.
[00:44:16.661 --> 00:44:17.682]  The Alex Jones is the right sale.
[00:44:17.982 --> 00:44:19.383]  And it's got to end this weekend.
[00:44:20.024 --> 00:44:26.309]  So I'm going to be up here on Nightmare Day, as if I care about that, getting ads cut, getting things ready, figuring out what the new sales are going to be.
[00:44:26.669 --> 00:44:29.172]  But this big sale's ending.
[00:44:29.472 --> 00:44:30.993]  You should go to InfoWarstore.com.
[00:44:31.654 --> 00:44:37.784]   If we were selling Peanuts is the fundraiser you should go buy to keep us on air, but we're not.
[00:44:37.804 --> 00:44:39.865]  We're selling high-quality products.
[00:44:41.086 --> 00:44:42.487]  And the sale is about to end.
[00:44:42.607 --> 00:44:44.147]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:44:44.588 --> 00:44:45.988]  Up to 50% off.
[00:44:46.148 --> 00:44:48.269]  And Ultimate Bone Bra, sold out for years back in stock.
[00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:49.430]  Nitric Boost.

[00:45:05.621 --> 00:45:08.621]   Go there now and support the tip of the spear and be part of the big win.
[00:45:08.621 --> 00:45:16.621]  [Music]
[00:45:16.621 --> 00:45:22.260]   If you go to onlinehealthnow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the wellness
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:22.621]  company.
[00:45:22.994 --> 00:45:26.835]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the company.
[00:45:26.875 --> 00:45:31.256]  I contribute like so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[00:45:31.416 --> 00:45:38.758]  Far and away the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's Detoxification Supplement that features natokinase.
[00:45:38.878 --> 00:45:41.018]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[00:45:41.199 --> 00:45:46.860]   This one is the only Enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:47.660]  This is very important.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:52.522]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[00:45:52.722 --> 00:45:54.202]  People are low with the spike protein.
[00:45:54.222 --> 00:45:55.062]  They don't feel well.
[00:45:55.183 --> 00:45:56.803]  This is a potential solution.
[00:45:56.883 --> 00:45:59.864]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[00:45:59.944 --> 00:46:02.725]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[00:46:02.865 --> 00:46:03.845]  Isn't it interesting?
[00:46:04.225 --> 00:46:10.087]  Natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
[00:46:10.327 --> 00:46:14.813]  OnlineHealthNow.com, thank you for your support, and thank you for getting into that because it's important.
[00:46:14.633 --> 00:46:36.033]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[00:46:36.078 --> 00:46:39.579]  Mr. Roth, who at the company actually went over your recommendation?
[00:46:39.599 --> 00:46:40.379]  Because you're pretty high up.
[00:46:41.819 --> 00:46:42.620]  Who overrode you?
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.121]  The decision was communicated to me by my direct supervisor.
[00:46:46.161 --> 00:46:46.881]  Who was that person?
[00:46:47.421 --> 00:46:48.481]  Her name was Del Harvey.
[00:46:48.721 --> 00:46:51.062]  She was the vice president of trust and safety at the time.
[00:46:51.262 --> 00:46:51.482]  All right.
[00:46:51.522 --> 00:46:52.042]  Thank you so much.
[00:46:52.642 --> 00:46:52.842]  Ms.
[00:46:52.862 --> 00:47:00.745]  Gaddy, real quick, you said to the chairman earlier, and I want to paraphrase what I heard earlier, is that Twitter had no contact with anybody from the Biden team.
[00:47:00.785 --> 00:47:01.885]  Is that correct to your knowledge?
[00:47:03.138 --> 00:47:03.878]  Not to my knowledge.
[00:47:04.458 --> 00:47:05.098]  Put that up for me.
[00:47:06.199 --> 00:47:09.739]  Okay, over my right shoulder, we have an email.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:23.382]  Reference, this is Saturday, October 24th, 5.39 p.m., referencing five different tweets with a Twitter email chain.
[00:47:24.302 --> 00:47:27.783]  Under the line, it's more to review from the Biden team.
[00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:37.636]  Does anybody have a comment on how much interaction was happening with the Biden team at Twitter with respect to tweets that they wanted Twitter to review?
[00:47:38.457 --> 00:47:38.557]  Ms.
[00:47:38.577 --> 00:47:39.298]  Gaddy, Mr. Roth?
[00:47:40.959 --> 00:47:42.180]  I'm not familiar with this email.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.682]  So you're not familiar with this email, Mr. Roth?
[00:47:44.702 --> 00:47:45.663]  Are you familiar with this email?
[00:47:47.244 --> 00:47:49.866]  Only from what's been reported in the Twitter files.
[00:47:50.106 --> 00:47:52.128]  Did you ever have contact with anybody from the Biden team?
[00:47:52.987 --> 00:47:53.727]  No, sir, I did not.
[00:47:53.887 --> 00:47:59.669]  We explicitly separated the teams that would interact with campaigns from teams like mine that were responsible for content marketing.
[00:47:59.689 --> 00:48:03.030]  How big was the organization in Twitter that was actually working with campaigns?
[00:48:04.111 --> 00:48:04.951]  I couldn't say for sure.
[00:48:05.271 --> 00:48:06.891]  Did you have any contact with the DNC?
[00:48:07.672 --> 00:48:08.172]  Directly?
[00:48:08.312 --> 00:48:08.812]  No, I did not.
[00:48:09.112 --> 00:48:11.593]  Did anybody at Twitter have any contact with anybody at the DNC?
[00:48:12.293 --> 00:48:14.334]  I think it's likely that somebody at Twitter did, yes.
[00:48:15.805 --> 00:48:19.207]  In these emails that's listed, these are tweets that hate to be flagged from the Biden team.
[00:48:19.487 --> 00:48:20.428]  That's what's in the files.
[00:48:21.529 --> 00:48:28.433]  You have no idea how many people actually engaged with the Twitter team or how frequently that engagement happened?
[00:48:29.933 --> 00:48:31.554]  No, and again, that was by design.
[00:48:31.654 --> 00:48:37.078]  We kept those functions separate from content moderation so that we could impartially assess reports like that.
[00:48:37.098 --> 00:48:41.100]  Do you know how many tweets were actually flagged and taken down at the behest of the Biden team?
[00:48:43.482 --> 00:48:46.683]  I wouldn't agree with the characterization of it as being at the behest of them.
[00:48:46.763 --> 00:48:50.764]  These tweets are reported and Twitter independently evaluated them under its rules.
[00:48:51.224 --> 00:48:52.484]  But the email is very clear.
[00:48:53.524 --> 00:48:55.685]  More to review from Biden team.
[00:48:56.245 --> 00:48:59.506]  The response three hours later at the bottom, hold this up real quick so we can see.
[00:49:00.066 --> 00:49:02.666]  The request at the bottom it says, handled these.
[00:49:03.767 --> 00:49:04.947]  What does handled these mean?
[00:49:07.472 --> 00:49:15.722]  My understanding is that these tweets contained non-consensual nude photos of Hunter Biden, and they were removed by the company under- Hold on, real quick, Mr. Roth.
[00:49:15.742 --> 00:49:18.164]  How could you know so much about the content of these tweets?
[00:49:18.184 --> 00:49:20.487]  I mean, as far as I'm concerned, these are just web addresses.
[00:49:20.828 --> 00:49:21.889]  I don't know what's in these tweets.
[00:49:22.529 --> 00:49:27.055]  You have these things committed to memory that you know the content, but you don't know who you talk to at the Biden team?
[00:49:28.669 --> 00:49:35.550]  Sir, I didn't meet with the Biden team, but there was extensive public reporting about these tweets specifically that uncovered what they were.
[00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:37.131]  You know the contents of the tweets.
[00:49:38.071 --> 00:49:39.291]  It was obviously at Twitter.
[00:49:39.991 --> 00:49:49.533]  But you have no idea how often people who worked in your organization had with the Biden team during the end of the 2020 presidency.
[00:49:49.853 --> 00:49:56.014]  Saying Hillary won, but in 2020 no one could question elections saying Trump won.
[00:49:57.708 --> 00:50:03.811]  You abused the power of a large corporation, Big Tech, to censor Americans.
[00:50:04.432 --> 00:50:05.532]  And you want to know something?
[00:50:06.073 --> 00:50:06.613]  Guess what?
[00:50:06.773 --> 00:50:08.414]  I'm so glad that you're censored down.
[00:50:08.474 --> 00:50:10.055]  I'm so glad you've lost your jobs.
[00:50:10.655 --> 00:50:12.997]  Thank God Elon Musk bought Twitter.
[00:50:13.617 --> 00:50:14.197]  And you know what?
[00:50:14.237 --> 00:50:16.138]  Let's talk about something a little bit further.
[00:50:17.639 --> 00:50:29.370]   It's amazing to me, Mr. Roth, as the head and trust of safety at Twitter, Your ability, or should I say inability, to remove child porn.
[00:50:30.451 --> 00:50:32.934]  Now here's something that disgusts me about you.
[00:50:33.555 --> 00:50:44.086]  In your doctoral dissertation entitled Gay Data, you argued that minors should have access to Grindr, an adult male gay hookup app.
[00:50:44.787 --> 00:50:45.267]  Minors?
[00:50:45.948 --> 00:50:46.248]  Really?
[00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:54.441]  You know, Elon Musk took over Twitter and he banned 44,000 accounts that were promoting child porn.
[00:50:54.962 --> 00:51:01.192]  You permanently banned my Twitter account, but you allowed child porn all over Twitter.
[00:51:02.332 --> 00:51:02.993]  Yep, it's a cult.
[00:51:03.013 --> 00:51:04.174]  Twitter has become a platform.
[00:51:04.315 --> 00:51:09.381]  Alright, Josh Alexander arrested in Canada for not worshipping transgenderism.
[00:51:09.401 --> 00:51:09.862]  Straight ahead.
[00:51:10.482 --> 00:51:12.745]  Well, he joins us to lay out what really happened.
[00:51:13.586 --> 00:51:27.758]   Josh Alexander, 60-year-old Catholic high school student from Canada who was arrested On February 6th, after being suspended for protesting his transgender people's use of bathrooms and saying there are only two genders, and now he's appealing to Ontario's Human Rights Tribunal.
[00:51:28.338 --> 00:51:32.801]  Here's a clip of folks that have also been arrested responding to it, with a video of him being arrested.
[00:51:32.641 --> 00:51:39.641]  and here it is.
[00:51:39.641 --> 00:51:46.641]  Yes, yes! Get to the school, how about it?
[00:51:46.641 --> 00:52:03.641]  Yellow police budget just balanced itself. I don't know.
[00:52:03.641 --> 00:52:04.641]  You know, hit pause here.
[00:52:05.528 --> 00:52:09.333]  Hit pause here, then we'll play the Toronto Sun piece, then go to our guest, the victim of this.
[00:52:10.307 --> 00:52:16.891]  He got the LGBT cult out there, wanting access to children, the bathrooms, the girls' showers, men having access to that.
[00:52:17.512 --> 00:52:21.615]  But the left says, a guy, an adult shouldn't ask a woman out for a date at the mall.
[00:52:21.695 --> 00:52:22.395]  That's rape.
[00:52:22.475 --> 00:52:29.120]  That's Gillette runs ads, you see all the ads, the corporate media, oh, men and women, men whistling at girls, that's rape.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.682]  Men asking girls out, that's horrible, that's misogyny.
[00:52:33.082 --> 00:52:36.484]  But this going on in the schools, all the world, corporate finance, that's good.
[00:52:36.785 --> 00:52:39.627]  If you're a radio listener, you can't see the image of the police arresting him.
[00:52:40.667 --> 00:52:44.089]  For simply criticizing this publicly for his speech.
[00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:45.250]  Where is the speech?
[00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:49.032]  Well, it's a protected group with the left cheering as he's arrested.
[00:52:50.353 --> 00:52:52.353]  Let's play the video of the arrest one more time.
[00:52:52.353 --> 00:52:54.353]  [Video playing]
[00:52:54.353 --> 00:52:56.353]  [Video playing]
[00:52:56.353 --> 00:52:58.353]  [Video playing]
[00:52:58.353 --> 00:53:01.192]  (crowd cheering)
[00:53:01.192 --> 00:53:05.012]  (crowd talking in background)
[00:53:05.012 --> 00:53:12.992]   And they turn the camera around at Rebel News and you see the organization that wants to have
[00:53:12.992 --> 00:53:16.512]   sexual discussions with your children cheering in the background.
[00:53:16.512 --> 00:53:19.512]  [Music]
[00:53:18.113 --> 00:53:19.413]  The tyranny isn't coming, it's here.
[00:53:19.433 --> 00:53:22.455]  They're trying to pass laws like this here in the U.S.
[00:53:22.475 --> 00:53:24.917]  They're having to pass laws to counter laws to do it.
[00:53:25.317 --> 00:53:27.959]  Tennessee's set to pass a law that restricts drag shows.
[00:53:29.517 --> 00:53:32.719]  Montana Bill would let students misgender classmates.
[00:53:32.739 --> 00:53:34.960]  Because they want to arrest students in Montana.
[00:53:35.521 --> 00:53:39.303]  If somebody says, I'm a girl, but they're really a boy, you should be able to call them Batman.
[00:53:39.323 --> 00:53:40.744]  You should be able to call them a donut.
[00:53:40.764 --> 00:53:42.945]  You should be able to call them whatever you want.
[00:53:43.185 --> 00:53:43.766]  It's free speech.
[00:53:44.892 --> 00:53:54.016]  But they've got to pass laws saying you don't bring little kids to naked sex shows, or kids are allowed if somebody wants to be misgendered, or is misgendered.
[00:53:54.076 --> 00:53:55.817]  I mean, this is such an assault!
[00:53:56.717 --> 00:54:10.863]  Josh Alexander joins us, 16-year-old Catholic high school student from Canada who was arrested Monday, February 6th, and reportedly twice, he can confirm that, after being suspended for protesting his transgender people's use of bathrooms and saying there's only two genders.
[00:54:11.653 --> 00:54:18.134]   The high school junior tweeted that Ontario police arrested him and charged him after he attempted to attend a class in
[00:54:18.134 --> 00:54:22.153]   violation of an exclusion order following his suspension earlier the school year.
[00:54:22.153 --> 00:54:28.172]   Josh, a born-again Christian, was hit with a suspension for allegedly organizing protests at a school against
[00:54:28.172 --> 00:54:32.353]   biological males and girls bathrooms and arguing in class that God created two
[00:54:32.353 --> 00:54:35.373]  unchangeable genders.
[00:54:34.758 --> 00:54:37.919]  Sir, we salute you, we support you, we thank you.
[00:54:38.019 --> 00:54:40.700]  You are the Rosa Parks of the 21st century.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:45.643]  I'm going to try to shut up, give you the floor to describe what happened, what you're witnessing, and where this is all going.
[00:54:45.823 --> 00:54:46.503]  Thank you so much.
[00:54:48.024 --> 00:54:49.124]  Yeah, thank you for having me on.
[00:54:50.145 --> 00:54:52.146]  Well, just start at the beginning and tell us.
[00:54:53.286 --> 00:54:58.669]  Yeah, so the video you're playing there on the screen, that was footage from my second arrest.
[00:55:00.111 --> 00:55:12.299]  So, the first one happened after I had spoken out in my school about female students who had addressed me and were quite concerned and disturbed by males who were using their washrooms.
[00:55:13.579 --> 00:55:18.342]  This was a topic that, as a young Christian man, I felt an obligation to speak out about, so I did.
[00:55:19.163 --> 00:55:29.069]  And I was suspended twice, excluded from my high school twice, and then eventually arrested and removed from the school.
[00:55:31.122 --> 00:55:50.213]  Yeah, this all, I've now been charged for trespassing at my school, and I was then arrested a second time on, two days later, in Ottawa, the protest I had organized outside of the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, against a drag queen story hour.
[00:55:50.494 --> 00:55:59.279]  And let's be clear, they're arresting people for protesting corporately funded drag queen pedo hours, and Canada is a tyranny, this is incredible.
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:08.006]  Yeah, so at that National Arts Centre, I actually got to go inside and see.
[00:56:08.046 --> 00:56:12.209]  It was completely inappropriate what was happening, but we communicated with the police liaison.
[00:56:12.249 --> 00:56:16.253]  They agreed that we could be able to have a sidewalk for the protest that day.
[00:56:16.893 --> 00:56:32.447]   And after I was assaulted by counter-protesters, the police dragged me out, threw me onto the street, and they ended up arresting myself and my brother for continuing to Quote scripture and give the gospel over a megaphone.
[00:56:33.087 --> 00:56:36.588]  And yeah, that's the footage you're seeing from the second arrest there.
[00:56:37.048 --> 00:56:38.268]  What are the enabling laws?
[00:56:38.368 --> 00:56:42.150]  I know Trudeau is still using, from the trucker protests, a national emergency.
[00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:48.111]  It was supposed to only be in the Capitol there, but now that's ongoing.
[00:56:48.491 --> 00:56:54.533]  What powers, what authoritarian, totalitarian powers are they claiming to arrest you for reading scripture?
[00:56:56.232 --> 00:57:03.315]  Yeah, so they actually, the first arrest, which was the most significant one, they claimed it was trespassing.
[00:57:03.495 --> 00:57:12.940]  I was at my own high school and they told me I was being excluded for what I had expressed.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:26.523]   I got in contact with Liberty Coalition Canada, they're funding my lawsuit, and I informed them that I would be attending school and I would continue to adhere to my Christian beliefs and in response to that the school informed me that I was excluded.
[00:57:27.965 --> 00:57:36.973]  I felt this was unlawful and discriminatory so I decided to attend school and within a few minutes I was arrested and put in the back of the cruiser and driven away.
[00:57:38.067 --> 00:57:49.470]  I know you say that's the most substantive charge, but for me, you protesting outside an arts center where little children are brought in to watch men dress around half-naked, I mean, to me, that's the big one.
[00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:57.652]  I know the charges aren't as long a prison sentence, but to me, that is like, you're not even at the school, you're protesting an event you're not allowed to protest in Canada?
[00:57:59.406 --> 00:58:00.246]  Yeah, apparently not.
[00:58:00.286 --> 00:58:08.510]  We've seen that at the Trucker Convoy, and any protests really since then, they don't take too kindly to our freedom of assembly.
[00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:14.133]  So the leftists can wave their flags and want access to children sexually, and pushing, mutilating them.
[00:58:14.153 --> 00:58:17.335]  They're allowed to protest and yell and scream, but you're not allowed to?
[00:58:18.575 --> 00:58:18.915]  Yeah, no.
[00:58:19.195 --> 00:58:19.596]  I'm not.
[00:58:19.616 --> 00:58:28.520]  Because it's one thing when a totalitarian country bans all protests, but when they selectively do it, that's the highest level of suppression of speech.
[00:58:31.135 --> 00:58:42.452]  So now you can go to the Liberty Coalition of Canada website and you'll be able to find a petition you can sign to vocalize your support for me.
[00:58:44.136 --> 00:58:44.856]  Yeah, hopefully.
[00:58:44.916 --> 00:58:49.078]  We're going to be using that in a fairly substantial announcement that's coming up.
[00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:56.462]  Okay, so folks will find that on Twitter at OfficialJosh underscore A, or give us the URL again for folks to sign the petition.
[00:58:56.702 --> 00:59:01.705]  We'll come back and talk about taking action and fighting this, because you're now fighting this, and we'll discuss that.
[00:59:02.965 --> 00:59:03.365]  Sure, yeah.
[00:59:03.886 --> 00:59:10.849]  So, for the petition, it's LibertyCoalitionCanada.com, and then for my personal website, it's SaveCanada.army.
[00:59:11.733 --> 00:59:22.341]  And then you get, like you said, my Twitter handles at OfficialJosh underscore A. Well, Josh, you've got a great bearing, and I bet your parents are proud of you.
[00:59:22.802 --> 00:59:24.343]  You give me hope for the future, my friend.
[00:59:25.383 --> 00:59:25.764]  Thank you.
[00:59:26.744 --> 00:59:30.988]  Well, we've got another segment, a couple more coming up if we've got time, but just what else do you want to add to the viewers?
[00:59:32.614 --> 00:59:35.595]  Yeah, I mean, it's time for us to stand up.
[00:59:36.415 --> 00:59:43.996]  I'm an American citizen as well, so I know there's issues going on in the States that are very similar to this, and it's obviously not just Canada.
[00:59:44.076 --> 00:59:55.018]  I've started my, or I'm now running my own organization called Safe Canada here, and I've got a bunch of young people that have my back, and we're together trying to make as much change as we can.
[00:59:55.538 --> 00:59:59.579]  So, one step you can take is go sign our petition.
[00:59:59.619 --> 01:00:00.719]  That's going to help us a lot.
[01:00:02.213 --> 01:00:08.099]  But yeah, it's time for not just the adults, but it's time for our youth to stand up and do something.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:14.685]  Our beliefs, our freedom of expression, our freedom of religion, our freedom of assembly, everything is under attack.
[01:00:14.765 --> 01:00:17.668]  The woke mob is stronger than it's ever been.
[01:00:19.358 --> 01:00:21.839]  The more we resist, the faster we get out of this.
[01:00:22.379 --> 01:00:34.405]  And I know a lot of young people think their voices aren't powerful, but they wouldn't be arresting me and trying to silence me if my voice wasn't powerful, and I'm just another high school student, so... And you are the blood of victory here, and I don't mean that to...
[01:00:35.285 --> 01:00:35.705]  But are you up?
[01:00:35.745 --> 01:00:36.125]  It's true.
[01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:38.426]  You're not taking this and backing down.
[01:00:38.466 --> 01:00:39.607]  You're building organization.
[01:00:39.627 --> 01:00:40.507]  You're standing up.
[01:00:40.767 --> 01:00:44.369]  You're using their attacks as an example to build energy and be a leader.
[01:00:44.509 --> 01:00:45.769]  This is victory.
[01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:49.691]  When the left bullies and intimidates an attack, we don't roll over and die.
[01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:50.731]  We fight back.
[01:00:51.071 --> 01:00:51.872]  We get stronger.
[01:00:52.112 --> 01:00:52.812]  They get weaker.
[01:00:52.892 --> 01:00:53.592]  Stay right there.
[01:00:54.293 --> 01:00:55.813]  Man, this guy's got me fired up.
[01:00:56.974 --> 01:01:00.535]  Our guest connection just dropped as we came back live, Josh Alexander.
[01:01:01.556 --> 01:01:01.976]  But wow.
[01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:04.771]  What a story, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:05.951 --> 01:01:07.231]  Absolutely insane.
[01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:08.632]  This is the tyranny of the left.
[01:01:09.112 --> 01:01:10.653]  They're trying to pass similar laws here.
[01:01:10.693 --> 01:01:18.675]  Hell, California did pass a law that if you misgender somebody, you see a big ol' fat dude with a beard, you say, hello, sir, at the cash register.
[01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:23.337]  That's some of the cases they have, and then you get arrested.
[01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:25.835]  I mean, this is mind control.
[01:01:25.855 --> 01:01:27.156]  This isn't attack on language.
[01:01:27.176 --> 01:01:30.178]  This is them making you submit to every one of their whims.
[01:01:30.718 --> 01:01:35.282]  Let's play a clip of the Toronto Star as a TV program talking about this.
[01:01:35.302 --> 01:01:35.742]  Here it is.
[01:01:36.803 --> 01:01:42.707]  On a normal Thursday morning in February, Josh Alexander would be getting ready for school.
[01:01:44.348 --> 01:01:45.069]  But not today.
[01:01:45.089 --> 01:01:48.131]  Yeah, no, I'm getting ready for Tucker Carlson.
[01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:52.074]  But there is a way for Josh Alexander to get back in the class.
[01:01:54.232 --> 01:02:04.621]  I would have to basically agree to a multitude of conditions that are contrary to my religious belief.
[01:02:04.481 --> 01:02:11.360]   would basically have to recognize that anybody can identify as a
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:18.721]   person that anybody else must identify them or address them in that manner.
[01:02:18.721 --> 01:02:26.881]   I'm also not allowed to be around trans people, I wouldn't be allowed to speak to them, I wouldn't be allowed to be in
[01:02:26.881 --> 01:02:27.680]  my classes.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:30.721]  There's not really a way for me to go back.
[01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:39.681]   In the classroom Josh Alexander feels that he's talking about the overall issue and not the individuals.
[01:02:39.761 --> 01:02:50.489]  As a born-again Christian and as somebody with freedoms in a country that has freedoms, Josh Alexander has some very strong views on this subject.
[01:02:51.781 --> 01:03:01.308]  Everything first erupted in a class debate, and that's basically how you have it, that's what I said.
[01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:14.939]  And then it went beyond that over time, where it got to teachers encouraging and defending male breastfeeding and stuff, and I ultimately called that pedophilia.
[01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:24.542]  Uh, that was another allegation against me, but the main one is that I said there's two genders and there's trans students in the class that did that bullying.
[01:03:25.342 --> 01:03:28.104]  This teacher in Oakville, wearing the prosthetic... Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:03:28.585 --> 01:03:29.485]  What are your thoughts on that?
[01:03:29.545 --> 01:03:33.888]  That teacher's allowed to teach and was in yesterday, and you're not allowed to go to school.
[01:03:34.169 --> 01:03:46.177]  Yeah, there's actually several, uh, memes going around right now on the internet showing me, uh, getting arrested, and then it shows the, uh, Oakville teacher standing there, and it...
[01:03:47.091 --> 01:03:49.252]  They're allowed in the school, and I'm not.
[01:03:49.852 --> 01:03:50.853]  That's pretty ridiculous.
[01:03:50.873 --> 01:03:56.295]  They're allowed to have an influential role, and I'm not allowed to go there just to complete an education.
[01:03:58.176 --> 01:04:01.817]  That problem's gonna follow me no matter which school I go to, I've already done it.
[01:04:01.877 --> 01:04:11.161]  My goal isn't to preach hate at anybody, I'm just, like you said, a student that wants to go to school, but I'm not gonna compromise my religious beliefs.
[01:04:11.221 --> 01:04:16.789]   My issue was never with the individual trans student, in fact, Okay, so Josh Alexander's here.
[01:04:16.849 --> 01:04:24.732]  He doesn't hate anybody, but he has a right to protest men being in girls' bathrooms, and that's what he is doing, and we've got him with us.
[01:04:24.912 --> 01:04:26.893]  So Josh, let's go back to the start, how this began.
[01:04:26.913 --> 01:04:38.618]  You were talking about it with the local newspaper slash TV program there, but describe your thoughtcrime here, and then how they extended to you protesting outside of drag queen pedo time, and arrested you again.
[01:04:38.678 --> 01:04:39.859]  So how did this start?
[01:04:41.693 --> 01:04:44.736]  Yeah, so I was always in the public board.
[01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:50.560]  Well, actually, sorry, I was homeschooled for my elementary years, and then in high school I was at the public board.
[01:04:52.342 --> 01:04:57.526]  And I actually became fairly well known for organizing student walkouts in solidarity with the Freedom Convoy.
[01:04:58.447 --> 01:05:02.450]  Myself and my organization, Save Canada, did that, and it spread all across Canada.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:22.085]  After that I was suspended so many times I just decided to switch to the Catholic Board and about a month into my time there I was informed by Concerned Female Students and I decided to take it to the administrators and inform them that there are in fact female students that are concerned that male students are using their washrooms.
[01:05:22.986 --> 01:05:30.092]   So I I just continued bringing it up to the principal and they still ignored me.
[01:05:30.112 --> 01:05:37.376]  I even brought a female student with me and they continued to just ignore it and they didn't pay me any attention.
[01:05:37.756 --> 01:05:50.498]   So at that point I decided to organize a protest outside my high school and two days leading up to the protest they suspended me indefinitely and said it was because of Bullying or something.
[01:05:50.818 --> 01:06:01.005]  Yeah, they brought up fake allegations of bullying and most of it was just for saying that there's only two genders and then backing it with my religious beliefs and just basic biology.
[01:06:01.085 --> 01:06:07.069]  But yeah, that's where they wanted to punish me first and I served that suspension.
[01:06:07.369 --> 01:06:15.443]   I got in contact with Liberty Coalition, started suing my school and Then they just excluded me.
[01:06:17.005 --> 01:06:22.030]  I returned regardless of the exclusion because it was unlawful and at that point they gave me a trespassing notice.
[01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:28.090]   I waited till the trespassing notice ended and then I returned to school again with just
[01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:36.250]  an exclusion and at that point that's when they arrested me.
[01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:40.650]   Well that's all very interesting and they use the trespassing thing as a clause but
[01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:47.010]   for me crossing the Rubicon here Josh Alexander is the drag queen pedo event that you protested
[01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:47.971]  being arrested there.
[01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:52.326]   *laughs* Talk about that, and then I know you're appealing to a body in the government.
[01:06:52.346 --> 01:06:53.006]  Tell us about that.
[01:06:54.827 --> 01:06:56.328]  Yeah, so I...
[01:06:58.343 --> 01:07:04.809]  I was informed that there was a National Arts Centre was going to be holding a Dread Queen story time.
[01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:12.741]   So I decided to throw together a poster with my crew and Yeah, we set up, we communicated with police liaison.
[01:07:12.781 --> 01:07:13.641]  They said we could be there.
[01:07:13.661 --> 01:07:14.241]  It was all good.
[01:07:14.482 --> 01:07:23.764]  We had an open line of communication and it was all going fairly smoothly until we were met by a massive group of counter protesters.
[01:07:24.345 --> 01:07:41.884]   They were physically pushed us away from the doors of the building where we, on the sidewalk where we've been protesting and Eventually assaulted me when I started giving the gospel through my megaphone and they took my hat off, threw it on the ground, stomped it out.
[01:07:42.884 --> 01:07:46.627]  They assaulted all of us, hit us, pinned me up against the wall.
[01:07:46.687 --> 01:07:58.836]  They did everything they could until police finally came in and they dragged us out rather than the people that were assaulting us and they threw us into traffic and then when we tried to get back on the sidewalk they threw us into traffic again and then arrested my brother for being in traffic.
[01:07:59.417 --> 01:08:24.522]   So At that point, I tried to return to my group of protesters, and I was told by the police if I didn't stop giving the gospel on my megaphone, I would be arrested for disruption, which isn't even a real charge, but I continued to... I was quoting John 316 in my megaphone, and they arrested me, and put me in cuffs, and held me in the cruiser for about two hours, and then charged me with trespassing.
[01:08:25.582 --> 01:08:26.943]  Wow, for being on a city street?
[01:08:27.964 --> 01:08:28.124]  Yep.
[01:08:29.586 --> 01:08:30.587]  Unbelievable.
[01:08:30.747 --> 01:08:32.529]  And again, this is the banning of the gospel.
[01:08:32.549 --> 01:08:36.332]  It's been going on for a long time in Canada, not just in communist China.
[01:08:36.833 --> 01:08:42.038]  Let's come back and talk about your worldview with Josh Alexander for one more segment.
[01:08:42.578 --> 01:08:49.204]  You can follow him on Twitter, that official Josh underscore A. And we'll also put on screen where you can sign the petition.
[01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:50.105]  We'll be right back.
[01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:50.486]  Stay with us.
[01:08:51.246 --> 01:08:51.506]  All right.
[01:08:51.547 --> 01:08:53.108]  We got one more segment with our guests.
[01:08:53.588 --> 01:08:54.369]  I got a bunch of news.
[01:08:54.970 --> 01:09:00.516]   So Josh Alexander, Canada was known as this open, free, fun country.
[01:09:01.096 --> 01:09:02.056]  Now you get Trudeau.
[01:09:02.136 --> 01:09:03.696]  He follows the whole globalist agenda.
[01:09:03.716 --> 01:09:05.077]  He says he wants to censor people.
[01:09:05.537 --> 01:09:07.077]  What's happening in your country?
[01:09:08.938 --> 01:09:10.318]  Yeah, it's chaotic.
[01:09:11.679 --> 01:09:18.920]  Like I was mentioning earlier, I was quite involved with the Freedom Convoy and the student aspect of that.
[01:09:20.861 --> 01:09:29.696]   I saw firsthand the violence that the The state will take to subdue civil disobedience.
[01:09:30.517 --> 01:09:47.249]  And it's crazy how Canada, which is a country that supposedly recognizes the supremacy of God and recognizes our fundamental freedom of religion.
[01:09:48.871 --> 01:09:52.033]  Like just yesterday, I was arrested in the shadow of the war memorial.
[01:09:53.772 --> 01:09:54.852]  Wow, so you just got arrested again!
[01:09:54.872 --> 01:09:55.232]  I mean, wow!
[01:09:55.073 --> 01:09:59.512]   who have died and sacrificed for the freedoms that we enjoy in this country and there I
[01:09:59.512 --> 01:10:00.512]  am.
[01:10:00.512 --> 01:10:07.193]   My dad was a veteran as well and I'm being arrested right in front of it for street preaching.
[01:10:07.193 --> 01:10:09.353]  And so you just got arrested again.
[01:10:09.353 --> 01:10:10.353]  I mean, wow.
[01:10:10.353 --> 01:10:14.112]  Well, no, that's where the National Arts Center was.
[01:10:14.112 --> 01:10:15.112]  Same arrest.
[01:10:15.112 --> 01:10:16.112]  Wow.
[01:10:16.112 --> 01:10:19.713]  So who is Trudeau?
[01:10:19.722 --> 01:10:21.323]  He says, I want to be a dictator.
[01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:23.025]  I want to follow the WEF.
[01:10:23.665 --> 01:10:24.746]  What do Canadians think of him?
[01:10:26.583 --> 01:10:27.263]  He's a puppet.
[01:10:27.303 --> 01:10:32.185]  I mean, Canada's kind of... Canada's fallen.
[01:10:32.325 --> 01:10:37.067]  It's on a drastic decline because of not just Trudeau.
[01:10:37.107 --> 01:10:38.607]  Everybody points at Trudeau.
[01:10:38.627 --> 01:10:46.690]  He's terrible, I agree, but you've got to look at our provincial and even our municipal government and just the self-censoring of the Canadian people.
[01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:50.471]  They're terrified, they're afraid to speak up, and it's going to cost them.
[01:10:50.491 --> 01:10:51.452]  People are going to regret it.
[01:10:51.692 --> 01:10:53.532]  Well, that was my next question.
[01:10:53.572 --> 01:10:54.613]  What happened to Canada?
[01:10:55.433 --> 01:10:58.835]  Klaus Schwab says it's the best example of a WEF-UN takeover.
[01:10:59.296 --> 01:11:08.142]  Total Agenda 21, 2030, all the different leftist ideologies being implemented, police arresting people everywhere, even peacefully protesting.
[01:11:08.642 --> 01:11:11.424]  How do they get the cops and their unions to be so evil?
[01:11:13.129 --> 01:11:19.093]  Yeah, well you say, like everybody, the stereotypical Canadian is just a polite guy.
[01:11:19.173 --> 01:11:27.418]  But the problem is, we allow ourselves to be manipulated and used without any resistance by our government.
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:37.685]  It's gone too far and now we're at a point where anybody who speaks out is being censored and arrested and charged.
[01:11:38.846 --> 01:11:49.473]  There's still pastors fighting charges for simply opening their churches during the pandemic and it's time that we come together as a nation and resist this.
[01:11:50.634 --> 01:12:18.407]   Far too many people are divided over, like even in the church, over denomination and all these Small issues when really there's a much larger issue at hand and so I hope that maybe my voice may be heard and people could go and support my petition and stay tuned for our future updates which are going to involve both America and Canada together against this globalist takeover.
[01:12:19.139 --> 01:12:21.442]  Well, as you know, she's covered your case.
[01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:25.566]  Tucker Carlson said, if we're going to invade countries and liberate them, why not invade Canada?
[01:12:25.586 --> 01:12:31.593]  It was tongue-in-cheek, but, I mean, really, Canada is in the throes of tyranny because of the parliamentary system.
[01:12:32.834 --> 01:12:37.900]  Trudeau is able to have a minority of the votes, like 30%, but stay in power.
[01:12:40.037 --> 01:12:55.959]   Yeah, and it's weird, when you look at the electoral map, you just see it's blue all across the map for Conservatives, but then when you get to Toronto and Eastern Ontario, where the majority of the city population is, It's just completely rad.
[01:12:55.979 --> 01:12:57.259]  So he's basically running.
[01:12:57.319 --> 01:13:03.542]  He's forgotten about the ruler communities and the farmers and the people that keep this country running.
[01:13:03.582 --> 01:13:05.823]  He's just catering to the large population.
[01:13:05.843 --> 01:13:07.084]  Well, he hasn't just forgotten about them.
[01:13:07.104 --> 01:13:10.566]  He's trying to ban cows and milk farming and all the rest of it.
[01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:14.307]  I mean, this is a takeover with police forces running over men, women and children.
[01:13:15.048 --> 01:13:16.748]  In the five minutes we have left, you have the floor.
[01:13:17.309 --> 01:13:19.970]  What else do you want viewers and listeners to know about the situation in Canada?
[01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:23.912]  Because we say, oh, that's Canada, but it's the same globalist running that agenda.
[01:13:25.791 --> 01:13:30.655]  Yeah, well, yeah, I'm an American citizen too, and I can see America, um...
[01:13:32.489 --> 01:13:34.170]  It's not standing up in the way it should be.
[01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:36.952]  America is supposed to be the land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:48.360]  I'm an avid American patriot, but I'm disappointed to see that when Canada, the country that I can see how weak the average person in Canada is, they refuse to stand up.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:53.424]  And even we held the freedom convoy that influenced the entire world to resist.
[01:13:53.964 --> 01:13:57.527]  And I don't know why America, when they were facing the same restrictions, didn't do so.
[01:13:57.907 --> 01:14:01.970]  So I'm calling on both nations to stand up and wake up to what's going on.
[01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:04.271]  Because it's going to be too late.
[01:14:08.334 --> 01:14:09.215]  Talk about your family.
[01:14:09.235 --> 01:14:11.036]  I would imagine they're proud of you.
[01:14:12.177 --> 01:14:13.037]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:14.958 --> 01:14:24.645]  Like I said, my dad's a veteran, so he's disappointed as well to see the freedom of expression and freedom of religion going down the tubes here.
[01:14:25.694 --> 01:14:28.980]  Uh, they're just letting me work things out with my lawyer and I'm going to continue to fight it.
[01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:31.485]  How do the police behave when they take you to the police station?
[01:14:31.645 --> 01:14:32.587]  Are they proud of themselves?
[01:14:34.351 --> 01:14:36.114]  So I've actually, I've never been taken to the station.
[01:14:36.295 --> 01:14:36.876]  They, uh...
[01:14:38.292 --> 01:14:52.758]  In Ottawa there they didn't really have a charge against me other than trespassing so they just ended up releasing me and told me not to go back and serve me some papers and at school they just they put me in the back of the cruiser and ended up driving me away and releasing me to my brother with charges.
[01:14:53.158 --> 01:14:54.718]  So I've never actually been to the station.
[01:14:55.258 --> 01:14:55.539]  Wow.
[01:14:57.079 --> 01:14:57.879]  How do you think...
[01:15:00.174 --> 01:15:05.879]  I was just going to say, however, they did steal $600 worth of my camera equipment there.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.943]  They took it off me, showed it in the video there, and they never gave it back.
[01:15:09.983 --> 01:15:11.304]  They're still refusing to give it back.
[01:15:12.885 --> 01:15:13.065]  Wow.
[01:15:13.085 --> 01:15:14.667]  They obviously have something to hide.
[01:15:16.989 --> 01:15:18.330]  So they never gave your camera back?
[01:15:19.251 --> 01:15:19.411]  Nope.
[01:15:21.949 --> 01:15:29.975]  How do they get compliant people like this to commit... I mean, everybody knows in North Korea this is wrong, in China this is wrong, you know, in Cuba this is wrong.
[01:15:30.075 --> 01:15:34.118]  How do these cops... I mean, I've seen the Canadian police all over the place really act horribly.
[01:15:34.559 --> 01:15:35.760]  Who the hell are these people?
[01:15:37.501 --> 01:15:40.463]  Yeah, I mean, they've just manipulated them with indoctrination.
[01:15:40.503 --> 01:15:47.059]   They truly believe that I am hateful and a threat to The majority of society, I suppose.
[01:15:47.099 --> 01:15:53.870]  Because a multinational, corporate-funded drag queen time wants to sexualize three-year-olds, you're bad for not liking it.
[01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:59.071]  Yeah, and the same with the gender dysphoria in the schools and all that.
[01:15:59.471 --> 01:16:02.892]  I've spoken out against that, and I've voiced my opinion on it multiple times.
[01:16:03.052 --> 01:16:05.833]  My issue is not with the individual transgender student.
[01:16:05.873 --> 01:16:12.295]  I have sympathy for them, and I think they've been wronged by society, they've been wronged by their parents, and they've been wronged by the education system.
[01:16:12.575 --> 01:16:13.355]  They're confused.
[01:16:13.655 --> 01:16:15.156]  Yeah, they've been inducted into a cult.
[01:16:15.176 --> 01:16:15.716]  They're victims.
[01:16:16.636 --> 01:16:18.257]  Yeah, they're victims as well.
[01:16:18.678 --> 01:16:27.165]  I mean, I'm not going to condone any one of them going into the woman's washroom, but I will still speak out and sit, but I still do have sympathy for them, because they have been wrong.
[01:16:27.545 --> 01:16:40.997]  It's the majority of our society that has backed down and allowed government corruption and ideology and political confusion into the education system, and that's what we're seeing.
[01:16:41.077 --> 01:16:44.179]  And you can look at the suicide rates in Canada amongst our youth.
[01:16:44.239 --> 01:16:44.880]  It's incredible.
[01:16:46.107 --> 01:16:47.928]  And it's saddening.
[01:16:49.349 --> 01:16:49.669]  Wow.
[01:16:49.769 --> 01:16:54.932]  Josh Alexander, Twitter, an official Josh underscore A. And how do people go sign the petition?
[01:16:55.372 --> 01:17:00.415]  And again, just in closing, you're appealing this to the federal government in Canada.
[01:17:00.435 --> 01:17:00.995]  Tell us about that.
[01:17:02.075 --> 01:17:05.797]  Well, I'm taking it to the Human Rights Tribunal.
[01:17:06.358 --> 01:17:11.000]  And my lawyer, James Kitchen, from Liberty Coalition Canada, is going to help me do that.
[01:17:11.969 --> 01:17:17.851]  So LivePetitions.com for his petition, Josh-Alexander, and that petition is calling for what?
[01:17:19.711 --> 01:17:24.172]  So it's just going to be, right now it's just a way to vocalize your support for me.
[01:17:26.933 --> 01:17:32.135]  But for some plans we're releasing very shortly, and that's going to involve both countries.
[01:17:33.535 --> 01:17:36.396]  So yeah, go to LibertyCoalitionCanada.com and you can sign my petition.
[01:17:37.469 --> 01:17:39.351]  In closing, what's the tip, Mature Canada?
[01:17:39.371 --> 01:17:42.013]  It seems like it's really awake, really upset from what I'm seeing.
[01:17:43.655 --> 01:17:44.696]  Yeah, it's hard to tell.
[01:17:44.716 --> 01:17:46.117]  It depends which community you go to.
[01:17:46.177 --> 01:17:51.782]  I'm currently in the most conservative riding in history, and I'm not receiving much support from my community.
[01:17:53.024 --> 01:17:57.147]  They're pretty, uh, I would say they're ashamed to have me in the community.
[01:17:57.187 --> 01:17:58.548]  I mean, I get so many messages.
[01:17:58.608 --> 01:17:59.209]  I get threats.
[01:17:59.249 --> 01:18:07.875]  I can walk down the street and, uh, I was just in Ottawa the other day and, uh, Antifa, all dressed in black and mask, run up to me, take photos of me.
[01:18:08.436 --> 01:18:13.240]  And then as they're walking away, they inform me that I'm going to regret this for the rest of my life and that they're going to ruin my life.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:13.400]  So.
[01:18:14.241 --> 01:18:16.847]  Yeah, I wouldn't say I'm getting much of a positive response.
[01:18:17.147 --> 01:18:17.428]  Wow.
[01:18:17.568 --> 01:18:18.189]  Well, keep fighting.
[01:18:18.209 --> 01:18:19.472]  You're getting a response around the world.
[01:18:19.933 --> 01:18:20.454]  God bless you.
[01:18:20.474 --> 01:18:21.416]  We will free Canada.
[01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:22.719]  Josh Alexander, thank you.
[01:18:23.559 --> 01:18:30.762]  We're covering all the big breaking news that's been unfolding the last few days with Emeril Robinson next hour on this live Friday edition.

[01:18:40.106 --> 01:18:43.808]  It'll also be simulcast on InfoWars.com and AlexJonesLive.com.
[01:18:43.948 --> 01:18:47.590]  Got some big guests, breaking news and more.
[01:18:49.264 --> 01:18:52.526]  I didn't know Eddie Bravo was here in town to Joe Rogan tomorrow, so I'm going to get him on tonight probably.
[01:18:52.946 --> 01:18:55.148]  We also got Matt Baker, who was really on fire yesterday.
[01:18:55.168 --> 01:18:56.388]  I want to have him on commercial free.
[01:18:57.429 --> 01:18:58.690]  That's all tonight, 6 p.m.
[01:18:58.730 --> 01:18:59.050]  Central.
[01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.530]  It's free.
[01:18:59.570 --> 01:19:00.071]  It's up there.
[01:19:00.491 --> 01:19:01.852]  It's alexjoneslive.com.
[01:19:04.413 --> 01:19:13.339]  Let me hit some of the real positive news in the fight against our biology and the fight against the family and the Deep State's admitted plan to overturn things.
[01:19:13.359 --> 01:19:14.520]  We'll do that in just a moment.
[01:19:15.674 --> 01:19:19.738]  Let me just say this, usually when I say a sale is going to end it ends around the time the sale ends.
[01:19:20.659 --> 01:19:39.762]   I have not ended this sale because again I've been so busy working and so busy on air and so busy doing interviews and our inventory is so down so low but we got a lot of stuff coming in in about a month so the cavalry's here and just a couple months ago we had gotten back into the red But it wasn't an insurmountable amount.
[01:19:39.782 --> 01:19:41.544]  It was a couple hundred thousand dollars a month we were behind.
[01:19:41.984 --> 01:19:43.886]  That's the bandwidth cost, by the way, of Bandop Video.
[01:19:43.986 --> 01:19:46.267]  It was 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 million views a day.
[01:19:46.408 --> 01:19:47.108]  That cost money.
[01:19:47.168 --> 01:19:50.050]  Cybersecurity, the crew, legal, all of it.
[01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:53.233]  But the good news is, is that our deficits are not that big.
[01:19:53.633 --> 01:20:00.518]  In the last month and a half, two months, listeners have really come through and put us into the black in the months we're in.
[01:20:01.639 --> 01:20:04.722]  But we're trying to gain money back for the months we lost.
[01:20:04.802 --> 01:20:05.863]  And I had savings.
[01:20:06.681 --> 01:20:09.003]  I personally have two million dollars as emergency backup.
[01:20:09.103 --> 01:20:19.053]  I put 100% in and then we had over seven million dollars of Bitcoin that we put in last year because we hadn't ordered enough product and supply chain breakdowns.
[01:20:19.073 --> 01:20:20.275]  We were ten million dollars behind.
[01:20:20.375 --> 01:20:24.679]  God literally found the number and somebody, we don't know who, gave it to us.
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:30.525]  So the good news is we don't have obstacles we can't overcome.
[01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:35.109]  But it's really up to you, plus we have great products you need.
[01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:42.052]  So I've got to today, and I'm coming in tomorrow, cut some new ads, talk about some of the products we're still going to have in stock.
[01:20:42.452 --> 01:20:45.854]  But we did our big sale, and so much of this stuff is almost sold out.

[01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:52.750]  They're ready to go.
[01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:55.711]  Full-spectrum CBD oil, infowarstore.com.
[01:22:57.458 --> 01:23:05.980]  So dovetailing with the guest we just had on, Josh Alexander, who's an amazing 16-year-old man, and I'm so proud of him and what he's doing.
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:10.181]  He makes anybody proud to know there's great youth like that out there.
[01:23:10.901 --> 01:23:16.743]  But everything you see happening in different parts of the world is targeted here.
[01:23:17.203 --> 01:23:18.243]  It's the same globalist cult.
[01:23:18.963 --> 01:23:24.705]  And they want to end the family, they want to destabilize civilization, they want to scramble everything.
[01:23:26.021 --> 01:23:31.324]  But how does a 16-year-old or a 10-year-old make a decision if they're a girl or they're a boy when they're really a boy or girl?
[01:23:31.764 --> 01:23:36.127]  How do they make a decision to have their breasts cut off or their penis cut off or their ovaries taken out?
[01:23:36.327 --> 01:23:37.848]  This is just sterilization made cool.
[01:23:38.528 --> 01:23:39.109]  Well, they can't.
[01:23:39.169 --> 01:23:40.209]  They can't join the military.
[01:23:40.249 --> 01:23:41.270]  They can't buy alcohol.
[01:23:42.871 --> 01:23:43.931]  They can't do any of that.
[01:23:44.572 --> 01:23:45.372]  They can't gamble.
[01:23:45.932 --> 01:23:48.094]  They can't do any of these things these vices adults can do.
[01:23:48.514 --> 01:23:55.218]  But the government can form a relationship with them, with psychologists, and convince them, outside of parental control, to have their body parts cut off.
[01:23:57.298 --> 01:23:58.698]  This video is on InfoWars.com.
[01:23:58.718 --> 01:23:59.859]  I hope everybody shares it.
[01:24:00.339 --> 01:24:00.659]  Watch.
[01:24:00.839 --> 01:24:06.761]  Activist confronts Tennessee Democrat at hearing on sexual mutilation of children.
[01:24:06.781 --> 01:24:11.022]  Conservative activist Matt Walsh has made a great film, does great work.
[01:24:11.402 --> 01:24:17.384]  Spoken at a Tennessee legislative hearing objecting to children being provided transgender medications and medical procedures.
[01:24:17.424 --> 01:24:18.524]  Some as young as seven.
[01:24:19.384 --> 01:24:20.525]  And he just made a great point.
[01:24:20.565 --> 01:24:20.905]  Here it is.
[01:24:23.384 --> 01:24:23.964]  Thank you, Mr. Walsh.
[01:24:24.004 --> 01:24:31.646]  I found it interesting, one of our people testified today that they had their gender affirming surgery at 16.
[01:24:31.686 --> 01:24:35.847]  I know you in former comments mentioned this on your blog.
[01:24:35.887 --> 01:24:39.188]  At about 16, you're an adult who's mature and can make decisions.
[01:24:40.049 --> 01:24:40.969]  You're that at 16.
[01:24:41.029 --> 01:24:42.389]  I don't care what anybody says.
[01:24:42.409 --> 01:24:50.212]  Even going so far as to say, you know, when you're 16, you should be married and could be pregnant or should be pregnant.
[01:24:50.892 --> 01:24:55.875]  So I'm curious if 16 is an adult in your view.
[01:24:56.035 --> 01:24:59.817]  Why does this bill have the minor defined as 18?
[01:24:59.918 --> 01:25:10.584]  Yeah, that's that's a hit piece you took from media matters from something when I was a radio host 13-14 years ago in my early 20s.
[01:25:11.644 --> 01:25:14.086]  It's also not an accurate reflection of what I actually said.
[01:25:14.106 --> 01:25:22.896]   I was talking about The fact that people tended to marry young historically and that's all that that was about.
[01:25:22.916 --> 01:25:27.117]  How does that relate to this subject?
[01:25:28.257 --> 01:25:38.960]  Just curious of your definition of if you feel like people are adults at 16 should... People are adults at 18, but actually your brain is not fully developed until you're 25.
[01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:44.121]  So we should be having a conversation about whether we should even be doing these surgeries to people at 18.
[01:25:45.279 --> 01:25:47.801]  But certainly before 18, it's absurd.
[01:25:47.821 --> 01:25:54.106]  I mean, do you think that a 16-year-old can meaningfully consent to having their body parts removed?
[01:25:57.848 --> 01:25:58.349]  Do you?
[01:26:00.289 --> 01:26:07.289]  No.
[01:26:07.576 --> 01:26:12.980]  Yeah, we ask the questions, it's not... Representative Henry, you are recognized.
[01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:18.255]  This is a game the left plays.
[01:26:19.336 --> 01:26:35.881]  What I've said on air for 20 years plus, when I got the courage up to admit what I'd done, that I had funded when I was younger, and I believe the lies that it wasn't a human yet and all the rest of it, I repented of it, I was wrong, that I financed some abortions with girlfriends.
[01:26:36.782 --> 01:26:37.742]  And that God touched my heart.
[01:26:39.164 --> 01:26:43.688]  I repented of it, and I'm still guilty of it, but God has reprieved me in the blood of Jesus.
[01:26:44.428 --> 01:26:45.269]  And they always write articles.
[01:26:45.289 --> 01:26:47.591]  There's been hundreds of them that I've seen, probably more that I didn't see.
[01:26:48.231 --> 01:26:49.292]  Jones is a hypocrite.
[01:26:49.392 --> 01:26:52.734]  He paid for abortions, but now he's against them.
[01:26:54.916 --> 01:26:55.116]  No.
[01:26:56.017 --> 01:27:02.362]  Just because somebody made some comments that they now disagree with 15 years later, you're allowed to change your opinion.
[01:27:04.329 --> 01:27:10.111]  So the left's like, why would he make this statement in front of his right-wing audience that he killed his children?
[01:27:12.577 --> 01:27:15.059]  How does that make them like him when they're against abortion?
[01:27:15.119 --> 01:27:15.319]  No.
[01:27:15.779 --> 01:27:17.000]  They're Christians.
[01:27:17.421 --> 01:27:18.782]  They've done things wrong, too.
[01:27:19.062 --> 01:27:22.905]  They understand, like King David, changing your heart and repenting and being sad for what you've done.
[01:27:23.265 --> 01:27:29.509]  And I've told those stories because I want women to know that have been part of this and men that have supported it who feel guilty.
[01:27:29.549 --> 01:27:35.334]  Instead of hardening your heart and supporting it, admit you're wrong and get on your knees to God and be cleansed of this.
[01:27:36.783 --> 01:27:37.764]  Because there is an afterlife.
[01:27:37.804 --> 01:27:39.765]  There is interdimensional entities.
[01:27:39.966 --> 01:27:41.207]  We are eternal.
[01:27:41.547 --> 01:27:44.850]  You will be with your children that you killed.
[01:27:46.231 --> 01:27:47.532]  As long as you go to the right side.
[01:27:48.413 --> 01:27:49.273]  And they will forgive you.
[01:27:49.954 --> 01:27:50.574]  This is real.
[01:27:52.056 --> 01:27:54.578]  And I would die in an instant for my children right now.
[01:27:54.998 --> 01:28:00.943]  I cannot believe that I ever got tricked and fooled into that by the system and I'm angry about it.
[01:28:01.183 --> 01:28:02.965]  So I'm admitting I've been wrong.
[01:28:03.285 --> 01:28:05.347]  I'm admitting I'm sorry!
[01:28:06.767 --> 01:28:08.448]  I'm saying, I want to do better.
[01:28:08.628 --> 01:28:09.888]  I seek your face, God.
[01:28:10.108 --> 01:28:10.768]  I repent.
[01:28:12.049 --> 01:28:13.069]  I want to be cleansed.
[01:28:13.929 --> 01:28:14.989]  I want to be sanctified.
[01:28:15.109 --> 01:28:16.810]  I don't want to be like this.
[01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:22.832]  And the left laughs and goes, ah ha, he had abortions and he's a hypocrite.
[01:28:22.892 --> 01:28:24.132]  No, you're hypocrites.
[01:28:25.492 --> 01:28:30.354]  The idea that somebody, like a murderer in prison, can't get reformed and say it was wrong what they did.
[01:28:31.431 --> 01:28:35.136]  The idea that you can't reform is a leftist, satanic lie!
[01:28:35.336 --> 01:28:39.456]   I don't care what you've done, how horrible it is, if you can still repent, you still
[01:28:39.456 --> 01:28:43.496]   feel the Holy Spirit, and you still want to be good, just like on the cross with Christ
[01:28:43.496 --> 01:29:00.855]  and the thief and the murderer, you will be sanctified.
[01:29:00.855 --> 01:29:03.375]  The cavalry has arrived.
[01:29:03.355 --> 01:29:16.457]  Ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality chicken-based bone broth you're going to find with all of the effects for your joints, your bones, your muscles, your heart, but more importantly, your immune system.

[01:30:20.018 --> 01:30:28.107]  Two pipelines, known as Nord Stream 1, provided Western Europe with cheap Russian gas for more than a decade.
[01:30:28.567 --> 01:30:32.668]  These pipelines were seen by NATO as a threat to Western dominance.
[01:30:33.209 --> 01:30:39.111]  Profits were shared with the Russian government and provided up to 45% of their annual budget.
[01:30:39.771 --> 01:30:45.593]  A second pair, called Nord Stream 2, had been built but were not yet operational.
[01:30:46.193 --> 01:30:56.900]  NATO was concerned that as long as Europe remained dependent upon these pipelines, Germany would be reluctant to supply Ukraine with money and weapons to fight Russia.
[01:30:57.361 --> 01:31:11.150]  And so the Biden administration authorized Jake Sullivan to assemble a task force with members of the Biden White House, the CIA, and the Pentagon to come up with a plan for the destruction of the pipelines.
[01:31:11.810 --> 01:31:16.873]  The operation was run by Victoria Newland, Anthony Blinken, and Jake Sullivan.
[01:31:17.474 --> 01:31:21.776]  The Navy proposed using a submarine to assault the pipeline directly.
[01:31:22.236 --> 01:31:25.959]  The Air Force proposed dropping bombs with delayed fuses.
[01:31:26.499 --> 01:31:30.962]  And the CIA argued that whatever was done, it would have to be covert.
[01:31:31.482 --> 01:31:35.745]  Because if the attack was traced to the U.S., then it would be an act of war.
[01:31:36.785 --> 01:31:49.890]  In early 2022, right after the CIA reported to Sullivan that they had a plan, both Victoria Nuland and President Biden publicly threatened to bring an end to Nord Stream 2.
[01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:56.913]  If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.
[01:31:57.613 --> 01:32:06.478]  If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again.
[01:32:08.039 --> 01:32:11.821]  Then there will be no longer a North Stream 2.
[01:32:12.302 --> 01:32:26.110]  According to the source, this public announcement meant that blowing up the pipeline no longer could be considered a covert option, and that there was no longer a legal requirement to report their plans to Congress.
[01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:37.999]  The Americans partnered with Norway, who had their own motivations for the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines, which would allow them to sell more of their own natural gas to Europe.
[01:32:38.739 --> 01:32:45.365]  In March of 2022, members of the team flew to Norway to meet with the Norwegian Secret Service.
[01:32:46.145 --> 01:33:05.651]  The Norwegian Navy decided on a spot in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, a few miles off Denmark's Bornholm Island, where the divers, operating from a Norwegian Alta-class mine hunter, would plant C4 charges with concrete protective covers on the four pipelines.
[01:33:06.577 --> 01:33:08.599]  Divers were chosen from the U.S.
[01:33:08.679 --> 01:33:27.216]  Navy's Diving and Salvage Center in Panama City, which specializes in training deepwater divers to use C-4 explosives, because they were Navy only and not members of America's Special Operations Command, whose covert operations would need to be reported to Congress.
[01:33:27.916 --> 01:33:48.826]   The mission was secretly embedded into an annual training exercise already scheduled for June of 2022, known as Baltic Operations 22, or BALTOPS 22, wherein the Panama City divers would place C4 explosives With a 48-hour timer attached.
[01:33:49.326 --> 01:34:00.468]  But the White House then worried that triggering the explosion within two days of the well-publicized training exercise would make it obvious that America was responsible.
[01:34:01.109 --> 01:34:07.770]  And so it was decided that the C-4 would be triggered by a sonar buoy, later dropped by plane.
[01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:14.832]  The buoy would emit a sequence of unique low-frequency tonal sounds to trigger the explosives.
[01:34:15.852 --> 01:34:24.482]  On September 26th, 2022, a Norwegian Navy P-8 surveillance plane dropped the sonar buoy.
[01:34:24.882 --> 01:34:34.533]  The signal spread underwater, and a few hours later, the high-powered explosives were triggered, and three of the four pipelines were put out of commission.
[01:34:35.288 --> 01:34:40.013]  According to Hersh's national security sources, it was a beautiful cover story.
[01:34:40.474 --> 01:34:47.881]  It was a covert operation that placed experts in the field and equipment that operated on a covert signal.
[01:34:48.362 --> 01:34:50.944]  The only flaw was the decision to do it.
[01:34:51.645 --> 01:34:55.645]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:34:55.645 --> 01:35:07.205]   Well, there's so many amazing pro-truth, pro-freedom, pro-America talk show hosts and
[01:35:07.205 --> 01:35:08.484]  reporters and analysts out there.
[01:35:08.486 --> 01:35:10.607]  One of my favorites is Emerald Robinson.
[01:35:10.627 --> 01:35:15.890]  And of course, she was a former White House correspondent for Newsmax and OAN, refused to be censored.
[01:35:15.930 --> 01:35:20.092]  She's currently the host of Absolute Truth with Emerald Robinson on frankspeech.com.
[01:35:20.112 --> 01:35:23.493]  You can find her on Twitter at Emerald Robinson, again, at Twitter.
[01:35:23.574 --> 01:35:27.956]  And she's with us to cover all the food processing plants and things that keep blowing up.
[01:35:28.656 --> 01:35:31.778]  And again, I like Jim Jordan on the surface, but he took a bunch of big tech money.
[01:35:31.798 --> 01:35:32.999]  He's been soft on Google.
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:37.662]  And is he really doing all he can do with these hearings?
[01:35:37.722 --> 01:35:39.263]  She wants to take him to the woodshed.
[01:35:39.283 --> 01:35:43.466]  I think it's important that we hold their feet to the fire.
[01:35:43.486 --> 01:35:45.047]  We'll talk about the pipeline blowing up.
[01:35:46.628 --> 01:35:47.369]  Joe Biden.
[01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:50.671]  Just the whole war in Ukraine.
[01:35:50.771 --> 01:35:52.072]  So much more with Emeril Robinson.
[01:35:52.392 --> 01:35:53.433]  Emeril, great to have you.
[01:35:53.453 --> 01:35:54.574]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:35:56.338 --> 01:36:01.586]  Why don't we get into the subcommittee on the weaponization of the FBI because I think there's a lot to unpack there.
[01:36:01.606 --> 01:36:08.617]  While there's lots of good soundbites, as there always are, there's been so much more going on behind the scenes and I've taken to the woodshed.
[01:36:08.677 --> 01:36:10.079]  I don't know if I go that far yet.
[01:36:11.178 --> 01:36:21.804]  The jury's still out on how Jim Jordan chairs this subcommittee, but I will tell you, Alex, I would have liked to have seen some different witnesses yesterday.
[01:36:21.824 --> 01:36:28.488]  I know from sources, and actually from Kyle Serafin, who is a former, one of the FBI whistleblowers, he came on my show yesterday.
[01:36:29.208 --> 01:36:44.396]  There were some actual whistleblowers who could have given their first-hand accounts, right, and been much more powerful witnesses out of the gate because, as you and I know, on the first day of a highly anticipated committee, the first hearing is when you're probably going to get most of your eyeballs, right?
[01:36:44.476 --> 01:36:48.238]  So, I think it would have been much stronger to put those whistleblowers out there.
[01:36:48.498 --> 01:36:52.360]  Some of them were willing to go public despite the kind of backlash they get.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.540]  They thought it was important.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:54.461]  They were slated.
[01:36:54.811 --> 01:36:59.891]   to be in the public testimony yesterday and then at the last minute they were moved to
[01:36:59.891 --> 01:37:02.371]  private testimony.
[01:37:02.371 --> 01:37:08.971]   We haven't gotten any word back from committee members on why that decision was made and
[01:37:08.971 --> 01:37:16.211]   so we hope to because we think it's important to explain why that decision was made given
[01:37:16.211 --> 01:37:17.211]  that.
[01:37:17.211 --> 01:37:20.451]   Absolutely, the question is why didn't Jim Jordan bring forward the slated smoking gun
[01:37:20.451 --> 01:37:23.530]   whistleblowers which would have been ten times more powerful.
[01:37:23.557 --> 01:37:26.100]  Is he backpedaling because he's getting big tech money?
[01:37:29.468 --> 01:37:31.969]  I think that yesterday that raised the questions even more.
[01:37:32.429 --> 01:37:36.431]  And there were a lot of questions heading into yesterday from people in D.C.
[01:37:36.491 --> 01:37:40.313]  who, you know, there are some good people in D.C., Alex.
[01:37:40.433 --> 01:37:42.794]  So, you know, you feel like there's none left.
[01:37:42.814 --> 01:37:58.631]   There are people who have been trying to help the committee and help them organize it in a way that they can be the most effective, tell them what to look for and how to actually approach the misconduct of the FBI, bring it out, and then how you
[01:37:58.631 --> 01:38:03.980]   deal with it once you prove it. And I don't think that they were feeling very
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:09.030]   hopeful headed into yesterday based on their conversations and then the change
[01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:13.260]   of witnesses. So they're not quite there yet.
[01:38:11.411 --> 01:38:22.738]  I also know that they haven't staffed up really enough to deal with the portfolio of material that they're going to have to deal with because it's not just the censorship, right?
[01:38:22.798 --> 01:38:30.062]  It's not just targeting parents who spoke out about CRT or genderqueer books and libraries.
[01:38:30.623 --> 01:38:35.946]  It's a whole host of issues to tackle and that requires a lot of help.
[01:38:36.582 --> 01:38:37.002]  I agree.
[01:38:37.022 --> 01:38:42.087]  So from your research as an investigative journalist, what has the FBI and Justice Department really done?
[01:38:42.107 --> 01:38:47.131]  I mean, they're not just saying that conservative Catholics are terrorists and secret memos now coming out.
[01:38:47.531 --> 01:38:49.853]  They're not just manipulating the election results.
[01:38:50.313 --> 01:38:55.698]  I mean, they are interfaced with old media, big tech against the American people.
[01:38:57.499 --> 01:38:58.120]  Yeah, they are.
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:21.988]   I mean, I feel like you look back and the term for touring guard from the old Roman days Really comes to mind when we're thinking about our FBI and CIA, because basically with the kind of censorship that they're doing and the interference, I believe in the elections, the way that they're targeting average American citizens for ideology, they're really the ones running the country.
[01:39:22.249 --> 01:39:25.891]  And I think Congress has to take a stand and try to take some ground back.
[01:39:25.911 --> 01:39:38.539]   And that's going to be a really hard job, because one thing I've discovered since November 3rd, 2020, and even before then, it became very clear to me in 2018 that An administration really doesn't have control of D.C.
[01:39:38.579 --> 01:39:39.439]  or the country, right?
[01:39:39.499 --> 01:39:47.744]  They can make some suggestions, but it's really the bureaucracy and then the intelligence community that has the most say as to what happens, especially when it comes to foreign policy.
[01:39:47.764 --> 01:39:52.246]  And you saw the head-butting that went on when Trump tried to change U.S.
[01:39:52.286 --> 01:39:53.347]  foreign policy.
[01:39:54.228 --> 01:40:00.631]  They were quick to try to take him out.
[01:40:00.671 --> 01:40:02.172]  That's how you got the Ukrainian impeachment.
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:04.380]  Well, that's right.
[01:40:05.181 --> 01:40:09.725]  Trump's not perfect, but what he did was anger the deep state and make them come out in the open.
[01:40:10.765 --> 01:40:17.651]  And we saw that what he tried to do, they just ignored, showing it's a bipartisan deep state, and that's what you're exposing.
[01:40:17.691 --> 01:40:20.593]  And so really, is Congress just ceremonial?
[01:40:20.733 --> 01:40:21.634]  Are they vestigial?
[01:40:22.154 --> 01:40:23.335]  Are they just a clown show?
[01:40:23.455 --> 01:40:31.882]  Or are they going to stand up like the Church Committee did in the 70s and reassert the people's control by our elected representatives over this out-of-control permanent deep state?
[01:40:34.423 --> 01:40:47.051]  Yeah, and I think that this is the opportunity to show it, to show that they actually can cause some effect and hold accountability to the institutions and take back ground of freedom for the American people.
[01:40:47.432 --> 01:40:48.993]  It will be this committee, right?
[01:40:49.133 --> 01:41:01.705]   To some degree, the Oversight Committee that's working very hard on also the censorship, but also, as Congressman Andy Bix said on my show today, He's particularly trying to tackle the surveillance that both you and I know a lot about.
[01:41:01.725 --> 01:41:08.616]  The FBI overreach and surveillance of regular American people that just seems to increase all the time.
[01:41:10.683 --> 01:41:14.325]  What can we do to get Jim Jordan to do his job?
[01:41:14.365 --> 01:41:23.050]  Because I'm not just here to criticize people for fun, but I know when you're real, like James O'Keefe and Veritas with that huge coup two weeks ago, now notice he's been removed.
[01:41:23.531 --> 01:41:26.472]  I mean, I know what it's like when you're actually really changing things that come after you.
[01:41:26.512 --> 01:41:27.613]  You've had that happen to you as well.
[01:41:28.153 --> 01:41:32.956]  And so Jim Jordan, it seems like, is no Mitt Romney, but he's also no George Washington.
[01:41:32.996 --> 01:41:34.017]  He's trying to play both sides.
[01:41:35.776 --> 01:41:38.277]  Well, I can tell you that they respond to pressure.
[01:41:38.297 --> 01:41:44.740]  So if you keep asking questions, the office gets uncomfortable enough to do something.
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:53.424]  So the case in point when, remember in the lead up to the midterm elections, and they kept talking about this group of whistleblowers, Jim Jordan was out there on the media all the time.
[01:41:53.464 --> 01:42:03.248]  He was writing letter after letter to the Biden Department of Justice, seeking answers and saying he was going to get accountability, that he was going to protect these whistleblowers.
[01:42:03.428 --> 01:42:11.614]   Well, After the midterms, the ones I was speaking to, they just didn't hear anything anymore from Jim Jordan's office.
[01:42:11.654 --> 01:42:17.178]  They weren't even hearing from his staffers other than when they would text, you know, or say something, say, oh, okay, yeah, we'll get back with you, but really didn't.
[01:42:17.859 --> 01:42:27.506]  So once we started asking Jim Jordan's office why they hadn't been in contact, did they plan to get in contact with them, they're saying you're not in contact, and we started reporting that on our show.
[01:42:28.286 --> 01:42:29.649]  Well, surprise, surprise!
[01:42:29.829 --> 01:42:36.101]  Jim Jordan's office reaches out to said whistleblowers and starts having conversation.
[01:42:36.702 --> 01:42:42.188]   And one of the things that Policy people in D.C.
[01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:45.851]  who are on the right side of things and who really care about our Constitution.
[01:42:45.891 --> 01:42:52.216]  American people are super concerned about the chipping away at the Constitution.
[01:42:52.777 --> 01:42:57.340]  They also know that Jim Jordan is someone, though he's hesitant, you can apply pressure to.
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:07.508]  So if you keep asking questions, you keep publicly reporting exactly what's going on and don't get caught up into the sensationalism of good soundbite.
[01:43:08.536 --> 01:43:14.100]  You can kind of shift him in the right direction to actually do the right thing.
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:15.921]  Well that was my next question.
[01:43:16.261 --> 01:43:19.344]  If you have smoking gun whistleblowers, that's what you cover.
[01:43:19.804 --> 01:43:22.386]  You don't just show a few emails and let them lie about it.
[01:43:23.847 --> 01:43:26.829]  Are they planning to bring the whistleblowers forward even though they interviewed them privately?
[01:43:27.890 --> 01:43:28.830]  Why haven't they brought them forward?
[01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:29.711]  That remains to be seen.
[01:43:30.632 --> 01:43:31.152]  We don't know.
[01:43:31.172 --> 01:43:35.314]  And that's something we're asking Jim Jordan's office about, along with other members of the committee.
[01:43:35.354 --> 01:43:44.137]  Now, from how I understand the committee structure, while Dan Bishop does have a certain amount of power, it is still really Jim Jordan's baby.
[01:43:44.197 --> 01:43:55.602]  There was some hope amongst the people who were trying to help them structure the committee that Dan Bishop would have a little more power than he seems to have, and that Jim Jordan would sort of just sign off on the subpoenas, right?
[01:43:56.182 --> 01:44:01.043]  As the chair, but as the sub-chair, that Dan Bishop would really be the one running it.
[01:44:01.063 --> 01:44:03.244]  It doesn't seem that they're there yet.
[01:44:04.384 --> 01:44:07.025]  So we're asking, why have it?
[01:44:07.445 --> 01:44:09.025]  Why didn't you put them out there first and all?
[01:44:09.085 --> 01:44:10.085]  And when will you?
[01:44:10.745 --> 01:44:15.227]  Why, if they're willing to go public, why just do it as private testimony?
[01:44:15.247 --> 01:44:26.198]   Because I think what everyone can agree on, and if you look at any polling, right, from real pollsters like Russ Mustard, Even Democrat voters want transparency.
[01:44:26.638 --> 01:44:30.200]  They just want to see what's behind the curtain instead of hearing talking points.
[01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:30.660]  That's right.
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:32.221]  Emerald Robinson, stay right there.
[01:44:32.241 --> 01:44:33.741]  We'll come back more and talk about this.
[01:44:37.924 --> 01:44:43.148]  Emerald Robinson's almost the rest of the hour, and I've got a lot of questions for her.
[01:44:43.168 --> 01:44:45.510]  I want to finish up with these hearings and how powerful they already are.
[01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:49.933]  Imagine how much more powerful they would be if Jim Jordan wasn't, I think, soft-pedaling things.
[01:44:49.953 --> 01:44:51.754]  I want to talk about the Veritas coup that's happening.
[01:44:52.395 --> 01:44:57.258]  I want to get into all of these hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of food processing plants blown up, burned down.
[01:44:57.939 --> 01:45:02.962]  Statistically, the insurance companies admit that this has got to be most of it being carried out by somebody.
[01:45:03.763 --> 01:45:09.329]  Big picture though, million foot view about the world today and what you see.
[01:45:09.469 --> 01:45:13.813]  I see a big awakening, but I see the system only increasing its tyranny in response.
[01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:18.218]  What is your view just as a human being about the world today?
[01:45:20.385 --> 01:45:22.066]  My view, I absolutely agree with you.
[01:45:22.086 --> 01:45:25.887]  And I saw that ramp up early in the Trump years, right?
[01:45:26.227 --> 01:45:31.768]  Because Trump's greatest legacy to me will always be the great awakening that he evoked.
[01:45:32.248 --> 01:45:37.550]  People became more aware of how corrupt our institutions were, how it was affecting their everyday lives.
[01:45:38.010 --> 01:45:40.251]  People, they thought that they could trust, they could not.
[01:45:40.631 --> 01:45:41.871]  And that's only accelerated.
[01:45:41.911 --> 01:45:52.494]   But as you said, in response, the system, the DC bureaucracy, the DC swamp, The globalists, the global institutions have all ramped up their plan.
[01:45:52.534 --> 01:45:54.615]  In fact, remember, they used to talk about 2050.
[01:45:55.115 --> 01:46:00.297]  And during the Trump years, this whole zero carbon has been moved up to 2030.
[01:46:00.817 --> 01:46:05.659]  And you can really feel that pressure when you're in Washington, D.C.
[01:46:05.699 --> 01:46:12.264]   And especially as I cover the Biden White House, Alex, You can almost sense the panic, right?
[01:46:12.324 --> 01:46:15.966]  Because they had so quietly been doing this for decades.
[01:46:16.126 --> 01:46:19.088]  They played the law game and infiltrated the institutions.
[01:46:19.128 --> 01:46:22.450]  But then when people were finally paying attention, it made it harder to do it.
[01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:25.852]  They knew their timeline was shorter and they're just moving so fast and so hard.
[01:46:26.292 --> 01:46:29.414]  And so we see these foods processing plant fires.
[01:46:29.454 --> 01:46:36.398]  We see the forced indoctrination of our children in school, despite the parents going and screaming and actually fighting this.
[01:46:37.230 --> 01:46:43.452]  It seems like the system is just doing everything it can to crush the will of the people.
[01:46:43.593 --> 01:46:44.533]  Cloud and Piven.
[01:46:44.633 --> 01:46:45.493]  Cloud and Piven.
[01:46:45.873 --> 01:46:52.876]  They know we're waking up, so they're accelerating their already-behind-schedule plan, but it only seems to, again, paradoxically wake more people up.
[01:46:53.296 --> 01:46:54.577]  So how do you see that ending?
[01:46:54.637 --> 01:46:57.558]  I mean, this is a wild time right now.
[01:46:59.457 --> 01:46:59.917]  I don't know.
[01:46:59.997 --> 01:47:10.023]  And that's probably the question I get asked the most, Alex, whether I go to a family gathering or whether someone sees me out in public and knows me or whether it's my kid, you know, kindergarten teacher.
[01:47:11.063 --> 01:47:12.204]  It's the question I get asked.
[01:47:12.284 --> 01:47:14.345]  And honestly, I don't know.
[01:47:14.365 --> 01:47:20.369]  I just try to cover the events as honestly as I can so people are aware of what is going on.
[01:47:20.749 --> 01:47:35.427]   But if things don't change soon, I'm not optimistic, I would say, how it ends, but I, you know, I'm Christian, so I always have my faith in the Lord, and I do what I can, but there's still the local level.
[01:47:35.947 --> 01:47:36.808]  This is what I tell people.
[01:47:36.948 --> 01:47:43.091]  If you're feeling overwhelmed, I think you can understand that at the local level, there's still an ability to affect change.
[01:47:43.111 --> 01:47:48.154]  It's a little bit harder to, you know, mess with the elections there, and people have to be more involved than they have.
[01:47:48.194 --> 01:47:53.573]   People have been so complacent over the last few decades, thinking that Good people were largely in charge.
[01:47:53.593 --> 01:48:02.820]  You know, overall, I mean, they always felt this system was somewhat rigged, but they felt a little bit safe because, you know, they were feeding their families and they can go buy a home and buy gas for their car.
[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:08.023]  But as that changes, they're getting a little more activated and you can go get involved.
[01:48:08.043 --> 01:48:08.944]  You can volunteer.
[01:48:09.064 --> 01:48:09.364]  You can.
[01:48:09.644 --> 01:48:13.307]  And I think, you know, the school board wins in Florida and really across the country.
[01:48:14.036 --> 01:48:26.425]  There was some major flipping of school boards and I think that's a great example and I talked to Ryan Gerduski of the 1776 PAC who was responsible for a lot of that and I asked Ryan, is this just a school board phenomenon?
[01:48:26.465 --> 01:48:29.747]  Can you do the same thing in any like local race across the country?
[01:48:29.847 --> 01:48:30.167]  Exactly.
[01:48:30.187 --> 01:48:32.948]  The moral of the story is, when good people take action, we're unstoppable.
[01:48:32.768 --> 01:48:36.247]   emulated, he said, I was just focused and was, you know, funded to focus on school boards,
[01:48:36.247 --> 01:48:40.288]   but you could really, you can really replicate this plan at any level.
[01:48:40.288 --> 01:48:44.887]   Exactly. The moral of the story is when good people take action, we're unstoppable.
[01:48:44.887 --> 01:48:47.527]   But how do you get the public to realize they have all the power?
[01:48:47.527 --> 01:48:54.287]   Just I keep saying it, and I try to think every time I do a broadcast and we talk about
[01:48:54.287 --> 01:48:59.247]   all the problems, I always try to talk about what is the solution, because I think people,
[01:48:59.966 --> 01:49:04.127]   It could be so easy for everyone to throw up their hands right now and say, "Well, it's over."
[01:49:04.334 --> 01:49:06.595]  You know, it's just going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:49:06.615 --> 01:49:07.816]  There's nothing I can do about it.
[01:49:07.856 --> 01:49:20.665]  But I think I think as outside of the mainstream media, we have to be aware that people can feel that way if we just talk about the doom and gloom every day without talking about, well, how are what are real solutions to fix it?
[01:49:20.685 --> 01:49:22.766]  And I have great guests on, as do you.
[01:49:22.826 --> 01:49:26.669]  And I know you're very proactive with yours as well and talking about what what's the big.
[01:49:27.253 --> 01:49:29.194]  And I think more people have to be doing that.
[01:49:29.214 --> 01:49:35.699]  And talking to our neighbors and our friends and family about it, a lot of people have wanted to turn apolitical, and I get that.
[01:49:36.059 --> 01:49:43.324]  But I think there's a soft way to encourage the people around us to be activated and not make them fearful or feel attacked.
[01:49:45.047 --> 01:49:46.047]  I agree with you.
[01:49:46.047 --> 01:49:52.487]   This whole Nord Stream thing coming out with Cyrus folks, Cyrus is one Pulitzer Prizes
[01:49:52.487 --> 01:49:55.367]  Meal I'm asking her back in the 60s right through today.
[01:49:55.367 --> 01:49:59.167]  He has good people in the government giving him intel.
[01:49:59.167 --> 01:50:02.648]   So I see that as very positive that he has these sources that we know.
[01:50:02.648 --> 01:50:06.086]   He's never lied about sources that exposed how the whole bombing happened
[01:50:06.086 --> 01:50:08.207]  and Biden's trying to deny it happened.
[01:50:08.207 --> 01:50:11.167]   But he went on TV and said, we're going to we're going to get rid of the pipeline.
[01:50:11.167 --> 01:50:14.608]   You know, if Russia invades, we're going to we're going to get rid of the pipeline.
[01:50:14.608 --> 01:50:21.327]   So. To me, that shows there is a major fissure or split inside the government as well.
[01:50:21.327 --> 01:50:23.806]   And there's a lot of folks in our government that don't want World War three.
[01:50:24.086 --> 01:50:25.208]  So that gives me hope as well.
[01:50:27.532 --> 01:50:31.174]  I agree, and I don't think we hear about them as often, but there are.
[01:50:31.354 --> 01:50:37.397]  And with Cy Hirsch's sources, and that was an extremely detailed piece, right?
[01:50:37.457 --> 01:50:48.143]  It was fantastically written, extremely detailed, and it's such detail that it is making it very difficult for the Biden administration to lie about it, even though they continue to do so.
[01:50:48.603 --> 01:51:01.671]   You saw the spokesperson for the State Department yesterday, I mean, he struggles a lot, but he really struggled in trying to counter the details presented by another reporter in Thio Hirsch's piece.
[01:51:01.711 --> 01:51:14.505]   And I'll tell you, I've talked to other people who have We're within the CIA and in the military intelligence and they had sources and they say Cy is absolutely right.
[01:51:14.525 --> 01:51:26.593]  And then you also have further confirmation and remember, I don't know if you saw it because it wasn't reported in even, you know, sort of some of the alternative media outlets we go to, but there was a podcast, Monkey Works.
[01:51:26.673 --> 01:51:28.114]  He likes to track this guy.
[01:51:28.174 --> 01:51:30.416]  He's a former DoD contractor.
[01:51:31.256 --> 01:51:37.640]  He likes to track the flight patterns of commercial flights, military flights, you know, aircraft.
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:48.145]  And he had picked up a Navy aircraft that was over the area where the pipeline explosion happened at about the time that it happened.
[01:51:48.165 --> 01:51:53.448]  And I think that was reported, you know, right after, a couple days after it happened.
[01:51:53.488 --> 01:51:54.708]  And that didn't get a ton of attention.
[01:51:54.748 --> 01:51:55.769]  We had covered it on the show.
[01:51:56.608 --> 01:52:06.712]  And then we talked about it again today with a CIA veteran and a military veteran, Larry Johnson, who said that that just further confirms what Cy Hirsch reported.
[01:52:06.772 --> 01:52:09.873]  And there's really no way to poke holes in Hirsch's reporting.
[01:52:09.913 --> 01:52:17.055]  Now, this is one of the major problems I have with it is that we have a media that is so willing to push us into war, right, with the narrative.
[01:52:17.355 --> 01:52:19.956]  And I can tell you, Alex, that.
[01:52:21.477 --> 01:52:21.697]  Yeah.
[01:52:23.083 --> 01:52:27.643]   and anchors have been told, it's just like with the COVID thing, remember when that money was
[01:52:27.643 --> 01:52:32.362]   coming from HHS and you weren't allowed to question the vaccines because the media companies were
[01:52:32.362 --> 01:52:36.842]   taking the money, the outlets were taking Biden administration money to basically sell the
[01:52:36.842 --> 01:52:39.962]  vaccines? It's the same feeling about Ukraine.
[01:52:40.111 --> 01:52:53.481]  When I talk to my friends who are still in corporate media, they're basically told, you can't say anything that counters the narrative coming out of the White House or the administration regarding Ukraine, what's really happening there.
[01:52:53.541 --> 01:52:54.622]  You have to go with the narrative.
[01:52:54.642 --> 01:52:58.184]  You can't ask if that's really the picture of the conflict on the ground.
[01:52:58.605 --> 01:53:01.087]  And you can't question Zelensky at all.
[01:53:01.527 --> 01:53:03.008]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[01:53:04.758 --> 01:53:07.819]  This facade is starting to break, and once it breaks, it's going to collapse.
[01:53:08.099 --> 01:53:08.800]  What comes next?
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:09.500]  Stay with us.
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:13.441]  Well, you can find her daily at frankspeech.com.
[01:53:13.961 --> 01:53:16.082]  Great investigative journalist, Emerald Robinson.
[01:53:16.602 --> 01:53:18.083]  Add Emerald Robinson on Twitter.
[01:53:18.883 --> 01:53:19.864]  Emerald, you got caught off of the break.
[01:53:19.884 --> 01:53:27.987]  You're making a point about this war, where it's going, how they create this wall of funding and censorship, like came out in the documents from Twitter last year.
[01:53:29.363 --> 01:53:34.945]  Don't just criticize open borders or forced inoculation or lockdowns, but don't criticize the Afghan withdrawal.
[01:53:35.405 --> 01:53:38.506]  Don't criticize the war in Ukraine.
[01:53:39.026 --> 01:53:45.688]  That's only legal to have the government involved trying to suppress citizens giving their opinion, claiming it's disinformation.
[01:53:45.708 --> 01:53:47.329]  It's real tyranny.
[01:53:48.449 --> 01:53:52.550]  And it seems like we have a Republican headline here, Republicans push to end Ukraine aid.
[01:53:52.590 --> 01:53:54.371]  It seems like people are starting to figure this out.
[01:53:54.811 --> 01:53:57.052]  And now with the news coming out this pipeline was blown up.
[01:53:58.188 --> 01:53:59.573]  Hell, Biden bragged about it before they did it.
[01:54:00.095 --> 01:54:02.543]  That really seems to take the moral high ground away.
[01:54:02.844 --> 01:54:03.687]  Where do you see this going?
[01:54:07.252 --> 01:54:11.854]  I do think with this reporting by SAI, it's going to make it harder for the U.S.
[01:54:12.215 --> 01:54:17.978]  to continue to send Ukrainian aid, because clearly we've escalated the situation and made it harder.
[01:54:17.998 --> 01:54:21.300]  That was the time that they were supposed to be doing diplomatic talks, right?
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:26.923]  Russia had shown a willingness to actually have diplomatic conversations, and while clearly the U.S.
[01:54:26.963 --> 01:54:47.522]   was busy partnering with Norway and other nations to sabotage the pipeline, which, you know, Joe Biden actually Made plausible in completing because he had lifted the sanctions and made it easier, you know, after the Trump, President Trump had tried to make it a little bit harder to actually complete the pipeline.
[01:54:48.282 --> 01:54:54.445]  I think, too, particularly Republican members or Congress are getting pressure from their constituents.
[01:54:55.071 --> 01:54:58.633]  To stop this crazy blank check to Ukraine aid.
[01:54:58.974 --> 01:55:17.206]  While their constituents are at home not being able to afford eggs and milk because it's so expensive and they don't have anyone to help them, our Congress and our administration and government continues to just send millions, millions over to Ukraine and that's not sitting well with people.
[01:55:17.966 --> 01:55:21.589]  And when you have the focus on it this way, they kind of have to do something.
[01:55:24.275 --> 01:55:24.935]  I agree with you.
[01:55:25.055 --> 01:55:27.936]  So, you're a smart lady.
[01:55:27.956 --> 01:55:29.077]  I want your opinion on this.
[01:55:29.677 --> 01:55:36.879]  How do you see this going with Russia set to basically triple the invasion they did a year ago in the next six, seven, eight days?
[01:55:37.660 --> 01:55:40.501]  I'm not glad Russia invaded, but I know the West started a proxy war there.
[01:55:40.521 --> 01:55:41.501]  I want to just see this end.
[01:55:43.302 --> 01:55:44.242]  Where do you think this is going?
[01:55:47.944 --> 01:56:04.887]   I'm not sure, but I would say that eventually, when I talk to people and I ask the question who know much more about, you know, Russia, the Ukrainian conflict than me, and diplomatic relations, You know, Russia has gained more ground than the U.S.
[01:56:04.967 --> 01:56:13.634]  ever promised they would, and at some point, it just doesn't look like it's possible for Ukraine to really win the conflict, even though we're in the proxy war with them.
[01:56:14.394 --> 01:56:17.537]  And at some point, there's just going to have to be some diplomatic sit-down.
[01:56:17.557 --> 01:56:22.480]  Now, you could also, I guess, take the pessimistic view and say, this is going to lead us into World War III.
[01:56:22.941 --> 01:56:25.543]  It's going to probably go one way or the other.
[01:56:25.563 --> 01:56:29.666]  I can't say that I really have a really good answer on that one.
[01:56:31.906 --> 01:56:33.307]  Let's shift gears into politics.
[01:56:34.247 --> 01:56:36.569]  What do you make of the DeSantis-Trump battle?
[01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:38.249]  DeSantis set to announce very soon.
[01:56:38.730 --> 01:56:40.971]  Trump obviously already announced attacking DeSantis.
[01:56:43.572 --> 01:56:50.016]  Watching this and getting ready for the 2024 campaign that's pretty much already started, what's your view on that?
[01:56:52.859 --> 01:57:00.488]  Well, I don't think it's benefiting Republicans, this, you know, kind of antagonistic relationship.
[01:57:01.148 --> 01:57:05.694]  I have lots of questions about Governor Ron DeSantis, right?
[01:57:05.714 --> 01:57:11.220]  I want to know what his real foreign policy is, because we don't know that.
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:24.369]   And he's spoken In the past, as a member of Congress, he's been supportive of aid to Ukraine and some of the more establishment foreign policy initiatives, and I think that could be a real red flag.
[01:57:24.489 --> 01:57:27.531]  I wonder, too, why he is backed by the establishment.
[01:57:28.214 --> 01:57:39.439]  What is so different about him who has been, you know, really hard-headed as a governor, considering how the establishment, the unit party, really want a governor to be?
[01:57:39.459 --> 01:57:41.960]  He wouldn't be the one you would think they would be supporting.
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:48.283]  Why are they, the Republican establishment, behind him in the way that they weren't behind Donald Trump?
[01:57:48.303 --> 01:57:50.124]  So I think those are questions that need to be answered.
[01:57:50.564 --> 01:58:03.749]  Now with the former president, who I thought was a great president, I don't think it benefits him to attack Ron DeSantis at this point because he's a very popular governor and he's been very effective for his constituents of Florida.
[01:58:03.809 --> 01:58:06.190]  Now would I say this is the best time for Ron to run?
[01:58:06.210 --> 01:58:08.311]  I don't think so.
[01:58:08.491 --> 01:58:14.494]  I think he should probably continue to stay king of Florida and he's a young guy and he has lots of opportunity for the future.
[01:58:14.614 --> 01:58:19.066]   I think it'd also be great to see him and Trump work together better Right?
[01:58:19.166 --> 01:58:23.608]  Because they are both so popular with the American people, and they were both so effective in their role.
[01:58:23.808 --> 01:58:43.137]  The only thing that concerns me about Donald Trump, and where I think he's weak, is that he continues to have some people around him who do not have America First initiatives really at heart, or the best interests of the American people in mind, and I think he still needs to do some personnel cleanup, as he has in the... Yeah, I mean, I'm worried sick of Jared Kushner.
[01:58:43.937 --> 01:58:47.298]  I'm really sick of his daughter, Ivanka.
[01:58:47.358 --> 01:58:53.459]  I'm really sick of him still saying the shot works when everybody knows it doesn't.
[01:58:54.239 --> 01:58:55.980]  But I like Trump being anti-World War III.
[01:58:56.020 --> 01:58:57.040]  I like him controlling the border.
[01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:58.180]  I like him bringing jobs back.
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:01.141]  I know the deep state hates him because he doesn't listen to them.
[01:59:01.161 --> 01:59:01.961]  He does whatever he wants.
[01:59:02.461 --> 01:59:05.461]  They like the Santas because he'll sit down at a table with the elites.
[01:59:06.042 --> 01:59:07.142]  Doesn't mean he totally agrees with them.
[01:59:07.162 --> 01:59:12.823]  But with Trump, his great asset is that he's pig-headed, but it's also his great negative.
[01:59:14.881 --> 01:59:17.482]  Well, and I think his foreign policy was a great asset, right?
[01:59:17.542 --> 01:59:19.403]  He was, he was truly America first.
[01:59:19.483 --> 01:59:27.427]  If he wouldn't have been for sending all this money over to Ukraine, there would have been, I don't think Russia would have invaded if Donald Trump has been, have been president.
[01:59:27.487 --> 01:59:30.428]  I think that's, you know, we all believe that.
[01:59:30.528 --> 01:59:39.652]  I don't think that we'd be currently in this situation, but if we had been, there'd been probably a quicker end and a more peaceful end to the conflict.
[01:59:40.453 --> 01:59:45.453]  I don't see when Rhonda Santas actually announces.
[01:59:45.453 --> 01:59:52.493]  I know the punditry is behind Rhonda Santas, right?
[01:59:53.011 --> 02:00:06.135]  And I can tell you, Alex, some of those people who are so pro-Trump and who still go on TV and talk pro-Trump all the time, you know, just Trump, Trump, Trump, and they talk to him on the phone all the time, they're chomping at the bit to back DeSantis.
[02:00:06.175 --> 02:00:08.396]  And they've already had these conversations.
[02:00:08.576 --> 02:00:13.797]  Major, you know, media figures who are aligned or are seen publicly to be aligned with Trump.
[02:00:13.857 --> 02:00:18.018]  They're ready to throw him to the wayside and get behind DeSantis.
[02:00:18.118 --> 02:00:22.639]  I think that Republican voters and real Republicans shouldn't fall into the trap yet.
[02:00:23.179 --> 02:00:25.180]  Wait and see and watch both of them.
[02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:32.021]  Because again, we have, there's a lot we don't know about Ron DeSantis, though he is clearly a very good governor for Florida.
[02:00:32.181 --> 02:00:34.382]  And there's no questioning that.
[02:00:36.877 --> 02:00:38.858]  I want to talk about infrastructure attacks.
[02:00:38.878 --> 02:00:43.539]  You already kind of mentioned this, but I mean, I've seen the insurance numbers.
[02:00:44.239 --> 02:00:50.241]  We're talking thousands of times the normal amount of every form of food processing burning down.
[02:00:50.621 --> 02:00:53.222]  We see Extinction Rebellion burning stuff down in Europe.
[02:00:53.582 --> 02:00:55.803]  We see the lefts, you know, cutting off infrastructure.
[02:00:56.663 --> 02:00:59.124]  What would the reason be to shut off U.S.
[02:00:59.184 --> 02:00:59.604]  infrastructure?
[02:00:59.624 --> 02:01:01.125]  And what do you think's behind all these attacks?
[02:01:03.526 --> 02:01:04.686]  Look, I...
[02:01:06.357 --> 02:01:07.597]  That's the easiest answer, right?
[02:01:07.717 --> 02:01:13.178]  There is no way when you put them on a list, and there's a great list that Zero Hedge put out, but it's only up to June 2022.
[02:01:13.518 --> 02:01:19.320]  We've seen dozens of more attacks since then on fruit food processing plants.
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:29.902]  You just have to look and know it doesn't happen that you have over a hundred plants hit, plants worldwide, without there being some kind of conspiracy.
[02:01:29.982 --> 02:01:31.522]  That doesn't accidentally happen.
[02:01:31.542 --> 02:01:58.576]   A kindergartner would know that, but particularly There's a Dr. Andrew Huff and he's one of the most famous whistleblowers right now and I'll say when you ask what can we do I mean the whistleblowers are really kind of saving the day right now right so we need to support whistleblowers but this one in particular Dr. Andrew Huff he's known because he was a vice president for Echo Health Alliance and he blew the whistle on Peter Daszak the CEO for Echo Health and how they really were involved with
[02:02:01.918 --> 02:02:16.146]  Well, what a lot of people might not know is that his other area of expertise happens to be critical food infrastructure, food supply.
[02:02:16.166 --> 02:02:32.752]   And that goes back to his days in academia when he was actually commissioned with the DHS, Department of Homeland Security, grant to create a list ...of critical food infrastructure, food processing plants, their vulnerability for a tool that DHS has called FASTACT.
[02:02:32.872 --> 02:02:34.153]  So he created this list.
[02:02:34.493 --> 02:02:35.293]  Hold on, Stanley.
[02:02:35.333 --> 02:02:36.933]  Tell us about that list when we come back.
[02:02:37.453 --> 02:02:39.454]  This is just breaking on Fox News.
[02:02:39.474 --> 02:02:40.314]  We'll have it when we come back.
[02:02:40.994 --> 02:02:45.235]  Another object over America has just been shot down over Alaska.
[02:02:45.755 --> 02:02:46.896]  So things are getting weirder and weirder.
[02:02:47.876 --> 02:02:55.859]  Well, I wanted to bring down the Chinese spy balloon story with Emerald Robinson, reporter over at Frank Speaks TV, former White House correspondent.
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:59.781]  But magically, this just broke like five minutes ago.
[02:02:59.841 --> 02:03:02.782]  We have the clip right now at a White House press briefing.
[02:03:02.862 --> 02:03:05.103]  They bring up another Chinese balloon shot down.
[02:03:05.524 --> 02:03:07.544]  Canada said last week another was already over Canada.
[02:03:07.865 --> 02:03:11.066]  Now there's another one and they confirmed they shot it down.
[02:03:11.126 --> 02:03:12.186]  So this is not an accident.
[02:03:12.287 --> 02:03:13.167]  What is China doing?
[02:03:13.527 --> 02:03:14.067]  Here's the clip.
[02:03:14.087 --> 02:03:15.488]  We'll get Emerald Robinson's take on it.
[02:03:16.135 --> 02:03:21.617]  Can you speak to rumors that there is another Chinese balloon above Alaska or any other parts of U.S.
[02:03:21.637 --> 02:03:22.517]  territory that the U.S.
[02:03:22.537 --> 02:03:22.957]  shot down?
[02:03:24.297 --> 02:03:31.240]  So I can confirm that the Department of Defense was tracking a high-altitude object over Alaska airspace in the last 24 hours.
[02:03:34.461 --> 02:03:42.363]  The object was flying at an altitude of 40,000 feet and posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian flight.
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:50.086]  Out of an abundance of caution and at the recommendation of the Pentagon, President Biden ordered the military to down the object.
[02:03:50.987 --> 02:03:51.528]  And they did.
[02:03:52.228 --> 02:03:54.891]  And it came inside our territorial waters.
[02:03:55.491 --> 02:04:01.297]  Those waters right now are frozen, but inside territorial airspace and over territorial waters.
[02:04:02.097 --> 02:04:04.339]  Fighter aircraft assigned to U.S.
[02:04:04.379 --> 02:04:07.823]  Northern Command took down the object within the last hour.
[02:04:10.501 --> 02:04:15.663]  Emerald, studying this, these balloons are between 70 and 9,000 feet.
[02:04:16.263 --> 02:04:18.063]  Now they're at 60 and 40,000 feet.
[02:04:18.443 --> 02:04:19.544]  These are not malfunctions.
[02:04:19.564 --> 02:04:20.684]  These are obviously provocative.
[02:04:21.224 --> 02:04:24.745]  We don't know yet why this is happening, but what's your view on it?
[02:04:27.146 --> 02:04:37.049]  Well, I think it's a clear provocation and it shows how little China thinks of Joe Biden and any kind of pushback.
[02:04:38.775 --> 02:04:42.597]  It'll get China's testing the waters in my opinion.
[02:04:42.617 --> 02:04:44.238]  I don't think it's just my opinion.
[02:04:44.278 --> 02:05:03.716]   If you look public sentiment, Rasmussen did a poll in the last week and Americans, the majority of Americans do feel like we're at risk of going to war with China or that we will go to war and that's not significantly From the Trump years, and they don't have a lot of confidence in how Joe Biden handles China.
[02:05:03.756 --> 02:05:05.579]  Clearly, most people feel that he's compromised.
[02:05:05.779 --> 02:05:11.629]  And especially as we learn more, as more people are learning about the laptop, since it's finally getting attention, Hunter Biden.
[02:05:12.529 --> 02:05:13.050]  Laptop.
[02:05:13.250 --> 02:05:13.970]  I think that's scary.
[02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:17.634]  What I also think is really scary, Alex, is I had Gordon Chang on this week.
[02:05:17.974 --> 02:05:21.737]  You know, he's a China hawk, a China expert.
[02:05:22.078 --> 02:05:27.703]  He says that in China, the Chinese people feel that they're preparing to go to war.
[02:05:28.023 --> 02:05:34.509]  A lot of the young men really feel like they're potentially going to be in a war.
[02:05:35.359 --> 02:05:41.782]  So clearly if the Chinese people are feeling that way, that's the downstream from the Communist Party.
[02:05:42.303 --> 02:05:46.225]  And I think that that's extremely concerning in telling us what kind of relationship we are.
[02:05:46.245 --> 02:05:49.686]  Well that's right, the Communist Party said a bunch the last few years, prepare for war with the U.S.
[02:05:49.766 --> 02:05:51.167]  and they're basically at war with us.
[02:05:51.687 --> 02:05:52.308]  That's a big deal.
[02:05:53.868 --> 02:05:56.428]  Yeah, but Joe Biden says that we're in a competition.
[02:05:56.448 --> 02:06:07.610]  And so when you have a country that views itself in competition with a country that thinks it's already actively at war, you're already starting in a handicapped position, not to mention what it means now for our military.
[02:06:08.031 --> 02:06:27.135]   I talked to members of the military, both current and former, active and veteran, and they're extremely concerned about the way we've depleted our resources with this Ukraine conflict and sent our weapons off and put ourselves in this sort of, you know, So they lure us into a war there, and then China launches its main war?
[02:06:29.876 --> 02:06:36.699]  We're in an extremely vulnerable position right now, and I think that's something that we don't talk enough about, and I think a lot of Americans are not aware of.
[02:06:37.699 --> 02:06:45.822]  Well, there's new footage of lasers, green lasers, from GatewayPlanet.com, it's also on InfoWars.com, just shooting down over Hawaiian islands.
[02:06:46.462 --> 02:06:48.283]  They're saying most likely from Chinese satellites.
[02:06:48.343 --> 02:06:50.584]  I mean, what in the world is that?
[02:06:53.314 --> 02:06:55.155]  Yeah, I saw that yesterday as well.
[02:06:55.275 --> 02:06:57.357]  And again, it's just that it's another provocation.
[02:06:57.377 --> 02:06:58.937]  I think China is testing the waters.
[02:06:59.018 --> 02:07:00.899]  And why wouldn't they at this point?
[02:07:01.019 --> 02:07:03.300]  It's long been their goal to take down the United States.
[02:07:03.340 --> 02:07:11.105]  And they see us, I think, at one of the most vulnerable positions we've been in, in decades, if ever.
[02:07:15.563 --> 02:07:18.567]  What do you think the average leftist woke person's doing right now?
[02:07:18.767 --> 02:07:20.710]  They just think, bring down America, that's the answer.
[02:07:20.730 --> 02:07:26.838]  Attack America, attack the family, attack God, attack... I mean, it's just, what are they gonna do if we actually get into a hot war with China?
[02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:30.823]  Well, probably fight with the Chinese, right?
[02:07:31.934 --> 02:07:36.458]  They'd probably take up arms with the invading army against the United States.
[02:07:36.478 --> 02:07:39.120]  They dislike their own country so much.
[02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:41.783]  But look, they're the ones in the media, Alex.
[02:07:41.823 --> 02:07:45.166]  They're the ones who yell the loudest and do have the microphone.
[02:07:45.246 --> 02:07:50.330]  But they're not, by and large, representative of the majority of Americans.
[02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:53.613]  I mean, the majority of Americans truly are patriotic.
[02:07:53.633 --> 02:08:02.640]   And for those who do identify as, say, Democrat or left-leaning, And there's some of those that I don't actually have in my family.
[02:08:03.762 --> 02:08:05.164]  They're getting really concerned.
[02:08:05.444 --> 02:08:16.628]   And I would say some of my family members who are your typical Democrats, teachers union, longtime Democrats, And they're not long for this world anyway because they're a bit older.
[02:08:16.988 --> 02:08:30.456]  They're getting very concerned for the generations they're leaving behind because they feel like America is not in a good place and that we are really at risk as they see what the Chinese are feeling emboldened to do.
[02:08:30.496 --> 02:08:34.999]  You've got to remember some of these, this is a generation that some of them remembers World War II, right?
[02:08:35.019 --> 02:08:38.981]  And so they're afraid of where we sit now.
[02:08:42.287 --> 02:08:44.110]  Well, there's definitely a big awakening happening.
[02:08:43.930 --> 02:08:45.970]  is military and the depletion of our own.
[02:08:45.970 --> 02:08:49.930]   And these are Democrats, you know, it's not the conservative, you know, pro
[02:08:49.930 --> 02:08:52.970]  troop Americans we often talk to a lot.
[02:08:52.970 --> 02:08:55.930]  Well, there's definitely a big awakening happening.
[02:08:55.930 --> 02:08:56.930]  We agreed on that.
[02:08:56.930 --> 02:08:59.810]  But are people really awake to how serious it is?
[02:08:59.810 --> 02:09:03.090]   They're awake that there's a problem, but they have any idea.
[02:09:03.090 --> 02:09:08.570]   I mean, I use the example Biden attacking the poorest workers in America, even
[02:09:08.570 --> 02:09:10.409]  though they raise almost no tax money.
[02:09:10.690 --> 02:09:14.128]   And they're now hiring 87,000 and saying they're going to target waiters and people.
[02:09:14.128 --> 02:09:20.329]   You only do that if you want to wreck the country and make people go off the worker
[02:09:20.329 --> 02:09:20.770]  rolls.
[02:09:21.505 --> 02:09:24.248]  I don't see how anybody can support something that cold-blooded.
[02:09:25.028 --> 02:09:29.914]  Our own ruling elite are against us while starting all these outside wars.
[02:09:29.974 --> 02:09:30.735]  It's incredible.
[02:09:32.673 --> 02:09:34.634]  And I don't think the majority of Americans do.
[02:09:34.634 --> 02:09:39.314]   It's just the people who have the microphone, the people in the media who want to be a part of the club.
[02:09:39.314 --> 02:09:40.153]  Right?
[02:09:40.153 --> 02:09:41.234]  They know what it's what.
[02:09:41.234 --> 02:09:42.474]  I mean, some are just dumb.
[02:09:42.474 --> 02:09:46.554]   I can tell you sitting in the White House press pool, about 30% of the media are just dumb.
[02:09:46.554 --> 02:09:51.673]   30% are activists and truly believe this stuff and believe this way.
[02:09:51.673 --> 02:09:55.552]   And another 30% just want to be in the club and be successful.
[02:09:55.552 --> 02:10:00.113]   And they know that, you know, the climb to the top involves selling out America
[02:10:00.113 --> 02:10:03.153]   at this point, and to really be in corporate media, you kind of have to,
[02:10:03.153 --> 02:10:04.512]  right, on a daily basis.
[02:10:04.512 --> 02:10:08.432]   You kind of have to agree to sell out your own country 'cause you're not gonna really tell the truth.
[02:10:08.547 --> 02:10:13.814]  And so, you know, but they're the people, they're not the real Americans.
[02:10:14.135 --> 02:10:17.940]  The thing is, is that real Americans do have to get louder, right?
[02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:23.067]  And again, it goes back to like we talked about a little bit earlier, getting more involved in your local government.
[02:10:23.907 --> 02:10:24.068]  Exactly.
[02:10:24.268 --> 02:10:30.646]   And your local leadership and officials make a big difference in your life, but that's the only way to start,
[02:10:30.646 --> 02:10:30.927]  right?
[02:10:30.927 --> 02:10:36.106]   Starting at the top and taking it back over is a lot harder to do and more overwhelming.
[02:10:36.106 --> 02:10:41.306]   You can start there and hope you do it in time before the top totally topples down the country and ruins it.
[02:10:41.306 --> 02:10:49.387]   Exactly. George Soros is spending billions to take over the law enforcement, to take over the prosecutors.
[02:10:49.387 --> 02:10:54.667]   And then he's got literal pedophile meth-head armies with a few thousand per cities
[02:10:54.667 --> 02:10:58.346]   that go out and try to intimidate populists or conservatives when we protest.
[02:10:58.469 --> 02:11:00.090]  That shows how weak the system is.
[02:11:00.450 --> 02:11:04.771]  If more people just protest and get involved and get engaged, it'll be totally clear we'll win.
[02:11:07.062 --> 02:11:07.923]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:11:07.943 --> 02:11:09.165]  I think there's still hope.
[02:11:09.365 --> 02:11:10.947]  It's just doing it.
[02:11:10.967 --> 02:11:16.054]  I am encouraged that some people are doing it, but I don't think it's fast enough.
[02:11:16.174 --> 02:11:25.126]  Not as fast as, you know, they're attacking our way of life and, like you said, trying to bankrupt even the poorest.
[02:11:25.626 --> 02:11:28.428]  People are the people who have to work hard and don't make a ton of money.
[02:11:28.448 --> 02:11:34.651]  And then again, even to our food supply, like I was saying, I don't think, you know, they've been predicting food shortages.
[02:11:34.672 --> 02:11:40.035]  But as I wrote in a piece for Sussex, they're not just predicting them, they're planning them.
[02:11:40.295 --> 02:11:41.796]  And that's very evident now.
[02:11:42.392 --> 02:11:49.476]  Oh, I mean, the UN and the EU and Australia, they're all just saying, ban 30% of your cows, 30% next year, and stop farming.
[02:11:49.536 --> 02:11:50.177]  It's all evil.
[02:11:50.217 --> 02:11:51.177]  We need less food.
[02:11:51.217 --> 02:11:52.518]  We've got to slow the planet down.
[02:11:53.079 --> 02:11:55.960]  It is so incredibly predatory at every level.
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:58.282]  Emerald Robinson, thank you so much for spending time with us.

[02:12:22.108 --> 02:12:29.813]  Israel, maybe Singapore, but I mean, it is important to know what they're going through, because that's what's next for us.
[02:12:30.753 --> 02:12:33.915]  Separately, I know all week long I've said, oh, this sale's about to end.
[02:12:34.495 --> 02:12:35.576]  I've been so busy, I haven't ended it.
[02:12:35.596 --> 02:12:37.037]  A bunch of stuff's about to sell out.
[02:12:37.377 --> 02:12:39.418]  The Alex Jones is Right sale has got in this weekend.

[02:14:04.876 --> 02:14:05.817]  Nothing, huh?
[02:14:05.757 --> 02:14:07.757]  What about Brain Force Ultra?
[02:14:07.757 --> 02:14:09.757]  Ummm...
[02:14:09.757 --> 02:14:14.757]  No.
[02:14:15.489 --> 02:14:16.490]  Okay.
[02:14:17.190 --> 02:14:17.751]  Thanks anyway.
[02:14:17.911 --> 02:14:18.151]  Yeah.

[02:14:24.074 --> 02:14:31.074]   Get your Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra right now at InforStore.com
[02:14:31.074 --> 02:14:38.074]   Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show as we blast into the fourth hour on the
[02:14:38.564 --> 02:14:39.945]  I'm Kelvin Hart from Kellisburn Media.
[02:14:40.205 --> 02:14:41.126]  And I'm Hannah Spera.
[02:14:41.606 --> 02:14:50.370]  And we've got a great show coming up for you today because this week down in New Zealand it is three wins to the people and one to the deep state.
[02:14:50.651 --> 02:14:52.892]  We've got a breaking story that we're going to talk about.
[02:14:52.972 --> 02:14:54.693]  It's medical tyranny here in New Zealand.
[02:14:55.313 --> 02:15:01.556]  But first, Kelvin, shall we do a little bit of a breakdown about what the ruling party, the Labour Party, has had to backtrack on this week?
[02:15:01.656 --> 02:15:05.000]  They've backtracked on controversial hate speech laws.
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:06.581]  In fact, they haven't really backed down on them.
[02:15:06.621 --> 02:15:10.526]  They're billing it in the media because, as you know, we're in an election year.
[02:15:11.186 --> 02:15:15.611]  They want to get it reinstalled and they want to then finish off the World Economic Forum.
[02:15:16.072 --> 02:15:17.734]  Davos dictates.
[02:15:17.994 --> 02:15:22.579]  So they've just parked it in their back pocket and while we're celebrating at the moment, we cannot rest on our laurels.
[02:15:22.859 --> 02:15:35.503]  Yes, because of course Chris Hipkins is cut from the same cloth, although he's trying to say that he's taking the Labour Party, which is like the Democrats over there in the US, back to bread-and-butter policy, which is of course traditionally for the working class.
[02:15:35.843 --> 02:15:44.886]  But they have taken on a lot of left-wing extremist woke policies of late here in New Zealand, bringing in a lot of legislation that has been really race-based, Kelvin.
[02:15:45.086 --> 02:15:45.406]  It has.
[02:15:46.283 --> 02:15:50.165]  We have race-based policies where it's a type of co-governance sharing.
[02:15:50.205 --> 02:15:56.969]  Now the Treaty of Waitangi, which we have here in New Zealand, is basically a partnership between the native people and the settlers who came.
[02:15:57.470 --> 02:16:01.912]  And on Waitangi Day, February the 6th, we celebrate the joining together of the nation.
[02:16:02.192 --> 02:16:09.577]  Although it is highly controversial, and you will see as we progress through the show, the pushback that's coming from all sides.
[02:16:09.597 --> 02:16:13.179]  And it's for people suddenly realise they're not the enemies, our governments are.
[02:16:13.599 --> 02:16:30.227]  Yes, and Donna Porcari-Phillips, the co-leader of the New Zealand Outdoors and Freedom Party, will be joining us in the second segment to take us through to the end of the show and break down some of these pushbacks that we've had here in New Zealand this week when little old Kiwis have actually stood up and spoken truth to power.
[02:16:30.527 --> 02:16:36.930]  And you know, the Kiwi bird, it's a flightless nocturnal bird that, you know, digs around in the earth for little grubs.
[02:16:37.690 --> 02:16:41.153]  So it's not really, you know, like the flying bald eagle or anything like that.
[02:16:41.413 --> 02:16:49.358]  But we need our Kiwis to get out of the dark, stand up, get into the light, and flap their wings and get off the ground and soar.
[02:16:49.398 --> 02:16:51.920]  Because Kiwis are traditionally very apathetic.
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:54.982]  But we know after this week, you guys have got it in you.
[02:16:55.682 --> 02:17:00.526]  Kelvin, the other breaking story that we should touch on now is the medical tyranny here in New Zealand.
[02:17:00.946 --> 02:17:07.110]  Because as you will know with the Baby Will story, the legal system was very happy to step in there, Kelvin.
[02:17:07.330 --> 02:17:07.950]  They were indeed.
[02:17:08.591 --> 02:17:18.175]  Now we have a mother-of-three, former Murrell candidate, who has been sectioned under the Health Act, which is the Compulsory Assessment and Treatment Act 1992.
[02:17:18.616 --> 02:17:23.338]  They seem to be using this legislation now to go after anyone who dares to question government narrative.
[02:17:23.798 --> 02:17:42.334]   If you are anti-JAB, If you have any adverse views against anything the government wants to do to you, like the 15 minute cities, like take your rights and freedoms away, all the good stuff you actually should be enjoying, then believe me, they're using the Health Act, under the Mental Health Act, to section you away.
[02:17:42.774 --> 02:18:01.239]  And we did break that story late last night here in New Zealand because we were on the phone with Pamela Taylor in the afternoon for over an hour as she had been taken from her home by the police with the mental health department and then she had been put into an emergency psychiatric service.
[02:18:01.599 --> 02:18:05.478]  where they had given her an assessment by Dr Nigel Fanshawe.
[02:18:05.478 --> 02:18:11.799]   She was then on the phone to us and we heard her be driven from that centre to the Waikare
[02:18:11.799 --> 02:18:15.558]   Hospital where supporters will be meeting at 9am this morning.
[02:18:15.558 --> 02:18:21.398]   And we heard the police talking to her, she was very calm, she was not sounding dysfunctional.
[02:18:21.398 --> 02:18:22.798]  She wasn't a complete nut bar.
[02:18:22.798 --> 02:18:23.879]  No, at all.
[02:18:23.938 --> 02:18:26.079]  They have deemed her to have mental dysfunction.
[02:18:26.419 --> 02:18:57.474]   Now this is all because the family court system here in New Zealand where the judge has actually ruled that she needed to go for psychiatric assessment because she's having problems with her husband as of last year when she attended the Wellington Freedom protests up there in Wellington and she travelled twice for a week and it's because of that that her husband and her views on COVID and the vaccine that her husband has got the courts involved And it's now sectioned her, so we will be getting more information on that as the days go on and trying to bring you that as we get more confirmation.
[02:18:58.214 --> 02:19:00.736]  We will be talking with Donna shortly about that, Kelvin.
[02:19:00.756 --> 02:19:04.298]  Yes, and Waikare Hospital is in Dunedin in the South Island of New Zealand.
[02:19:04.518 --> 02:19:19.800]   Yes, so if you're in New Zealand, please get down to Waikare Hospital, Psychiatric Hospital at 9am, well right now, if you can get there, go down and we'll see you shortly after the break with Donna at Pōkiri Phillips to discuss this Medical tyrannical breaking story here in New Zealand.
[02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:22.203]  Yes, it's going to be fun, believe me.
[02:19:22.924 --> 02:19:26.589]  Yes, and she'll also talk about Waitangi, so see you shortly.
[02:19:27.248 --> 02:19:28.408]  On the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:28.909 --> 02:19:32.150]  We are now going to bring on our guest Donna Porcari-Phillips.
[02:19:32.190 --> 02:19:35.331]  She is the co-leader of the New Zealand Outdoors and Freedom Party.
[02:19:35.651 --> 02:19:37.112]  She has a Master's in Law.
[02:19:37.432 --> 02:19:41.674]  She has been a former candidate for Te Pāti Māori, which is the Māori Party here in New Zealand.
[02:19:42.074 --> 02:19:49.717]  She's been a former mayoral candidate and she's always advocated for Māori, which are the indigenous population here in New Zealand, in her community.
[02:19:50.137 --> 02:19:51.437]  Welcome to the show, Donna.
[02:19:51.457 --> 02:19:53.378]  Kia ora.
[02:19:53.998 --> 02:19:55.459]  Thank you for inviting me on.
[02:19:57.398 --> 02:19:58.779]  It's great to have you on.
[02:19:58.859 --> 02:20:05.205]  Now we are going to touch base first with you about this breaking story about Pamela Taylor, the mother of three in Dunedin.
[02:20:05.525 --> 02:20:10.209]  What are your thoughts about the information that you know that actually hasn't been published in the mainstream yet?
[02:20:12.451 --> 02:20:20.497]  Well what that tells me is that I think we have desperate people in government doing desperate things.
[02:20:20.637 --> 02:20:27.984]   So if you don't agree with the government narrative, What they are saying to all of us is that you can be sectioned.
[02:20:28.965 --> 02:20:29.646]  It's appalling.
[02:20:29.666 --> 02:20:58.808]   100% correct and that seems to be As soon as people started discovering the fact that they have their true power, they're now looking at things like the common law, they're looking at living law, they're realizing there is a difference between law and statute and the fact that we have rogue governments who are basically taking over in a tyrannical regime format and suppressing their populations and expecting them to basically just curtail to everything that they want to inflict on behalf of their foreign puppet masters.
[02:20:59.148 --> 02:21:12.272]  Yeah, and Kelvin, the most worrying thing for me is that what Pamela is reporting is that in the court documents that we are yet to see, it's been said that she has extremist views, Donna.
[02:21:12.552 --> 02:21:15.413]  Now, someone might say that you've got extremist views.
[02:21:17.614 --> 02:21:22.856]  Yes, the media has told me I've got extremist views tantamount to being a domestic terrorist.
[02:21:24.383 --> 02:21:27.605]  You know, what we have to look at is our constitutional makeup.
[02:21:27.765 --> 02:21:43.333]  In 1986, we had a bloodless coup here in New Zealand, where without the people's mandate, the Lange government back in 1986 made themselves sovereign.
[02:21:44.274 --> 02:21:50.937]  So it goes to show, I mean, tyranny goes back a few decades, actually.
[02:21:52.698 --> 02:21:53.339]  It certainly does.
[02:21:55.030 --> 02:22:04.335]  From that point on, New Zealand was operating under assumed parliamentary sovereignty and that's why nothing we do, whether we put submissions in, you go for your marches, go for your...
[02:22:06.539 --> 02:22:12.845]  You can basically complain until the cows come home and these people just say, too bad, we're in charge, you'll do what you're told.
[02:22:13.225 --> 02:22:22.414]  But the good news is Donna, isn't it, that New Zealand is a small country, we've only got 5 million people, and when we stand up and when we push back, actually change can happen.
[02:22:22.454 --> 02:22:27.018]  So what we're going to start with now, the first video we want to bring up is you at Waitangi.
[02:22:27.258 --> 02:22:29.660]  Do you want to do a little set up for this video?
[02:22:30.521 --> 02:22:32.223]  What exactly was going on?
[02:22:34.618 --> 02:22:44.906]  Well, myself and New Zealand Outdoors and Freedom Party, alongside our co-leader Sue Gray, who is very popular in the freedom space here in New Zealand.
[02:22:45.967 --> 02:22:52.671]  We had been sitting, well, camped out in Waitangi for three days.
[02:22:53.772 --> 02:22:58.816]  We managed to get ourselves onto the panel for the therapeutic products bill.
[02:22:59.689 --> 02:23:00.490]  The day before.
[02:23:00.850 --> 02:23:05.234]  It was challenging for us to get there, but we did get there in the end.
[02:23:05.694 --> 02:23:13.601]  However, we did organise to get ourselves onto the political panel and we're told at the last minute that we weren't allowed.
[02:23:13.721 --> 02:23:20.827]  So what we did is we decided that we would ask questions from the floor.
[02:23:20.847 --> 02:23:23.029]  Excellent.
[02:23:23.049 --> 02:23:25.751]  Now let's roll that clip and then we'll come back and break it down.
[02:23:25.771 --> 02:23:26.672]  Donna and Waitangi.
[02:23:29.438 --> 02:23:35.300]  My father, I buried him six months ago of his vaccine injury.
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:42.662]  I'm going to have a kōrero here because this is the appropriate place to have a kōrero.
[02:23:42.782 --> 02:23:43.083]  It is.
[02:23:43.183 --> 02:23:45.563]  I want to talk to the members of Parliament.
[02:23:45.402 --> 02:23:49.402]   No, no, I'm going to have a kōrero here because this is the appropriate place to have a kōrero.
[02:23:49.402 --> 02:23:50.402]  It's not.
[02:23:50.402 --> 02:23:51.402]  It is.
[02:23:51.402 --> 02:23:53.201]  I want to talk to the members of parliament.
[02:23:53.201 --> 02:23:59.841]   You did not come out in the occupation for the vaccine injured and people like my father
[02:23:59.841 --> 02:24:01.241]  who I buried six months ago.
[02:24:01.984 --> 02:24:06.506]  My husband's whānau, they buried 13 in one month.
[02:24:06.526 --> 02:24:08.687]  13 who were all vaccine-injured.
[02:24:08.847 --> 02:24:12.229]  I want to know, I want to know, do you represent us?
[02:24:12.809 --> 02:24:14.970]  Are we part of your whānau?
[02:24:15.070 --> 02:24:19.092]  Are we part of your community as the vaccine-injured?
[02:24:19.152 --> 02:24:20.213]  As those that were mandated?
[02:24:20.752 --> 02:24:32.031]   Will you support, will you support, will you support, no no no my pathway, my pathway is
[02:24:32.031 --> 02:24:37.791]   will you support a royal commission on the safe and effectiveness of the vaccine rollout?
[02:24:37.791 --> 02:24:38.791]  That's my pathway.
[02:24:38.791 --> 02:24:39.791]  So please come to our tent for more kōrero.
[02:24:39.791 --> 02:24:40.791]   We invite you, we're the only political party with a tent over there.
[02:24:40.791 --> 02:24:41.791]  We also have a tent and we've been there for many years.
[02:24:41.791 --> 02:24:55.752]  We also have a tent and we've been there for many years.
[02:24:55.752 --> 02:25:01.716]  Do you support a royal commission on the vaccine and those who fight, like my father?
[02:25:01.595 --> 02:25:08.075]   Do you support a Royal Commission on the vaccine and they're fine!
[02:25:08.075 --> 02:25:10.075]  Like my father!
[02:25:10.075 --> 02:25:12.075]  Hey, this is the place to do it.
[02:25:12.075 --> 02:25:14.075]  It is the place to do it.
[02:25:14.075 --> 02:25:20.835]  Now Donna, you are surely understandably upset after that.
[02:25:20.843 --> 02:25:34.695]  I mean, that video has gone viral around New Zealand and around the world because what actually happened there for people watching from overseas is those people that were sitting on the stage are actually elected MPs from the Green Party and they actually shut you down, didn't they, by singing.
[02:25:34.735 --> 02:25:43.282]  Now, what happens for people who don't know, with traditional Māori protocols with singing, with waiata, how is that usually used and how did they use it?
[02:25:45.452 --> 02:25:59.319]  So after you have your male speaker, someone gets up and does a waiata or a chant in support of that speaker and then the whole group will get up and support, as you saw on the stage there.
[02:25:59.839 --> 02:26:09.084]  Only very rarely is it used to shut a speaker down, a male speaker down, and I saw that when I was a very young child.
[02:26:09.682 --> 02:26:18.589]  And I saw my nanas get up and close down a karaua, which is an old man, after he was speaking.
[02:26:18.869 --> 02:26:24.193]  So it's used, I mean, I'm 60 now, and I would have been around five or six at that time.
[02:26:24.954 --> 02:26:26.955]  So it's used very, very rarely.
[02:26:27.015 --> 02:26:28.056]  And that's what you saw.
[02:26:28.556 --> 02:26:47.405]   I didn't know at the time that there was another karaua, another old man, where they shut down his Kōrero, the message he was trying to say, they also shut down with a waiata and with a song.
[02:26:49.426 --> 02:26:51.367]  And of course, that would be Pou Mia McKay.
[02:26:52.007 --> 02:26:59.650]  We will be airing his as well, not only the shutdown scene, but also his clarification of what he was trying to say shortly.
[02:26:59.690 --> 02:27:03.232]  And of course, we'll keep you on to break down and get your analysis on that as well.
[02:27:03.612 --> 02:27:15.397]  Yeah, so Donna, why don't you clarify as well, because it's really important that people understand your father has passed away from this jab and also your husband has had 30 members of his family in the last month.
[02:27:15.697 --> 02:27:18.418]  In the next two minutes of this section, let's break that down.
[02:27:22.170 --> 02:27:22.811]  So what happened?
[02:27:22.851 --> 02:27:27.134]  You just tell us about what's happening in your family now.
[02:27:27.234 --> 02:27:30.876]  So when I said 30, that was post-jab.
[02:27:31.597 --> 02:27:35.620]  In one month, my husband had 30 of his whānau pass away.
[02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:41.564]  And it's difficult for family when they're grieving to actually connect the dots.
[02:27:41.704 --> 02:27:45.787]  Actually, there were 17 in a matter of two weeks.
[02:27:46.269 --> 02:27:53.811]  And that was the worst month, but you know, you're talking about deaths continuously for the last two years.
[02:27:54.231 --> 02:28:07.755]  Every time there was a rollout here in New Zealand, where they'd have clinics and they were using bribery, like money, TV, phones, food, to encourage families to come and get the jab.
[02:28:08.208 --> 02:28:12.092]  Well, as Māori, we go in clusters, right?
[02:28:12.132 --> 02:28:14.674]  We go in family clusters to get the jab.
[02:28:15.134 --> 02:28:21.220]  And so they were dying in clusters and we've recently been having unveiling in clusters as well.
[02:28:21.740 --> 02:28:25.043]  The thing is, our people know there is something wrong.
[02:28:25.644 --> 02:28:28.967]  They just haven't quite put the dots together yet.
[02:28:31.215 --> 02:28:41.543]  And of course in New Zealand the problem here is, and it's now absolutely proven, that we have an excess all-cause mortality rate that is far beyond any measurable scope from before.
[02:28:42.182 --> 02:28:54.269]  I mean, and you're right, we saw the advertising, we saw the coaxing of the young ones, especially about protect your whakapapa, which for those of our international audiences, your lineage, your bloodline.
[02:28:55.469 --> 02:28:57.671]  Protect your family, go and get yourself jabbed.
[02:28:58.491 --> 02:29:02.393]  Not too many people were taking up, okay, we'll give you, going to a draw for an iPad.
[02:29:02.733 --> 02:29:05.135]  Oh hey, we'll give you some burgers, we'll give you some ice creams.
[02:29:05.615 --> 02:29:08.716]  And of course, we just really need to let you know that many of you already know this, but Alex Jones was right.
[02:29:08.736 --> 02:29:11.857]  There is an emergency sale on 50% off all the top selling products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:11.697 --> 02:29:17.456]   So we'll be back after this with Donna Paul, Katie Phillips to continue with this analysis.
[02:29:17.456 --> 02:29:22.136]   And of course we just really need to let you know that many of you already know this but
[02:29:22.136 --> 02:29:28.336]   Alex Jones was right, there is an emergency sale on 50% off all the top selling products
[02:29:28.336 --> 02:29:30.777]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:29:30.777 --> 02:29:35.777]   This is really important to help them with their war chest to keep the free speech fund
[02:29:35.777 --> 02:29:36.777]  operational.
[02:29:36.777 --> 02:29:41.056]   Your purchase is a 360 win and will help take the Infowar to the next level.
[02:29:41.228 --> 02:29:43.849]  Because of course, InfoWars has been leading the way.
[02:29:43.889 --> 02:29:45.610]  They've been the tip of the spear for many, many years.
[02:29:45.950 --> 02:29:48.751]  They've now given us a platform to get the New Zealand story out.
[02:29:49.112 --> 02:29:50.792]  So please do get behind them.
[02:29:50.852 --> 02:29:54.594]  Many of our team have purchased their products over the years and we love them.
[02:29:55.154 --> 02:29:57.536]  So get out there and support them.
[02:29:57.736 --> 02:30:10.106]  Because also, this is what you need to know about the Therapeutic Products Bill that's getting rolled out here in New Zealand, which is going to limit access to these types of supplements and even just plants that can help with our health.
[02:30:10.727 --> 02:30:13.389]  And it's all really important now, Kelvin, isn't it?
[02:30:13.449 --> 02:30:15.871]  Especially with this jab being rolled out and the effects of it.
[02:30:16.511 --> 02:30:22.881]  Well we no longer have, well do we ever have, in a health system in New Zealand, we have an illness maintenance system.
[02:30:23.141 --> 02:30:34.044]   You cannot profit off healthy people, hence that's And let's bring in everything that does you bad, because that will keep continuing to create new customers as they go forward.
[02:30:34.165 --> 02:30:38.128]  And boy, those pharmaceutical companies have made a killing over COVID.
[02:30:38.548 --> 02:30:47.256]  Yeah, and so what Donna was talking about up there on Waitangi at our National Day over the weekend, they were also talking about Rungua Māori, which is Māori medicine.
[02:30:47.616 --> 02:30:52.720]   Now Donna, before we look at Paumea's Excellent stand up there in Waitangi.
[02:30:52.980 --> 02:31:01.424]  Why don't we get your quick comment about Oranga Maori and why, like all natural medicines, it needs to be taken out of the Therapeutic Products Bill?
[02:31:03.806 --> 02:31:15.332]  Yes, so in 1907 we had the Tohunga Suppression Act that was brought in to get rid of Māori healing practices and bring in modern medicine.
[02:31:15.792 --> 02:31:19.834]  The Therapeutic Products Bill is the Tohunga Suppression Act.
[02:31:20.172 --> 02:31:26.172]   Part 2, but it includes all natural medicines, not just rongoā Māori.
[02:31:26.172 --> 02:31:28.172]  It's devastating.
[02:31:28.172 --> 02:31:34.172]   My husband depends on rongoā Māori and natural medicines to keep himself alive.
[02:31:34.067 --> 02:31:34.927]  He's a diabetic.
[02:31:35.347 --> 02:31:46.749]  When my father was first vaccine injured in 2021 after his second vaccine, we put him on natural medicine and Rongoā Māori to help keep him alive.
[02:31:47.369 --> 02:31:50.570]  If I can just share a little bit about what happened to my father.
[02:31:52.250 --> 02:31:56.131]  So he was vaccine injured, got myocarditis with his second vaccine.
[02:31:56.687 --> 02:32:00.568]  With his booster, I was really shocked that he got his booster.
[02:32:00.628 --> 02:32:14.852]  And I truly believe that he was pressured by the medical fraternity and people very close to him because he was told, and the propaganda was, protect your whakapapa.
[02:32:15.412 --> 02:32:20.773]  Now, he had already got myocarditis with his second vaccine.
[02:32:21.411 --> 02:32:22.972]  So his heart was already injured.
[02:32:23.052 --> 02:32:27.034]  With the booster he got pericarditis and pleural effusion.
[02:32:27.735 --> 02:32:38.361]  By the time I got down to the hospital when he was vaccine injured the second time, he also had ulcers in his mouth, down his throat, and in his stomach.
[02:32:38.581 --> 02:32:44.725]  And they did not feed him, they did not give him water, and they did not give him any medication for four days.
[02:32:45.105 --> 02:32:51.410]   To me, that was voluntary euthanasia without Even speaking to his whānau, to his family.
[02:32:51.930 --> 02:32:54.091]  So this is personal for me.
[02:32:54.671 --> 02:32:57.051]  My father was injured and then he passed.
[02:32:57.331 --> 02:33:01.613]  And like I said in that video, we buried him just over six months ago.
[02:33:02.913 --> 02:33:03.693]  This is serious.
[02:33:03.713 --> 02:33:04.874]  Absolutely disgraceful.
[02:33:05.614 --> 02:33:08.795]  It's absolutely disgraceful what's happening in this country and indeed around the world.
[02:33:08.875 --> 02:33:14.096]  And it seems it's the same playbook playing out in every country.
[02:33:14.136 --> 02:33:16.197]  The entire Western world is under attack.
[02:33:17.037 --> 02:33:22.421]  Definitely, and now what we want to play next is the POMEA, the stand-up POMEA video.
[02:33:22.821 --> 02:33:35.210]  Now, he does talk about the separation of powers and, you know, the corporate state, and there's a great Greg Rees video you can watch about this as well where he's talking about the corrupt corporation and the three different states they've created around the world.
[02:33:35.450 --> 02:33:38.853]  So let's play POMEA and we'll come back for comments.
[02:33:39.868 --> 02:33:51.821]  All of the statutes in the Parliament of England assembled, and all the dominions belong in there too, and all of the laws and customs are the same.
[02:33:53.102 --> 02:33:56.846]  Therefore you know there is a difference between statute and law.
[02:33:57.426 --> 02:33:59.328]  Law is made by the attorney.
[02:34:02.586 --> 02:34:04.847]  Law of gravity was not made by man.
[02:34:05.527 --> 02:34:11.190]  Now I want to go on and say that there is three groups of people assembled here today.
[02:34:11.210 --> 02:34:16.333]  There is the elected public servant and there is the appointed public servant.
[02:34:16.713 --> 02:34:18.894]  Put the emphasis on public servant.
[02:34:19.234 --> 02:34:20.295]  And there's the public.
[02:34:21.015 --> 02:34:22.756]  And there's the public.
[02:34:23.796 --> 02:34:24.397]  There they are.
[02:34:24.417 --> 02:34:25.077]  Let me finish.
[02:34:25.457 --> 02:34:26.978]  And there's the public.
[02:34:27.058 --> 02:34:29.399]  Now, I was late and I apologize.
[02:34:29.959 --> 02:34:41.113]   And I hope That in my absence, that they began this hooey, hands off, with their national anthem, E hoa atua.
[02:34:41.133 --> 02:34:49.296]  So, before the solid forces, this 82-year-old ko matua, return servicemen, leave me alone, let them do their thing.
[02:34:50.399 --> 02:34:54.040]  Okay, if you did not begin this hooey with our National Hymn, end the hooey with this National Hymn.
[02:34:55.041 --> 02:34:55.941]  If you don't... Stand up.
[02:34:55.961 --> 02:34:56.161]  Stand up.
[02:34:56.181 --> 02:34:56.921]  Just leave me alone.
[02:34:56.941 --> 02:34:57.101]  Stand up.
[02:34:57.121 --> 02:34:57.421]  Stand up.
[02:34:57.461 --> 02:34:57.921]  Just leave me alone.
[02:34:57.941 --> 02:34:58.221]  Stand up.
[02:34:58.242 --> 02:34:58.822]  Just leave me alone.
[02:34:58.862 --> 02:34:59.042]  Stand up.
[02:34:59.082 --> 02:34:59.782]  Just leave me alone.
[02:34:59.802 --> 02:34:59.962]  Stand up.
[02:34:59.982 --> 02:35:00.362]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:00.382 --> 02:35:00.562]  Stand up.
[02:35:00.582 --> 02:35:00.982]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:01.002 --> 02:35:01.262]  Stand up.
[02:35:01.282 --> 02:35:01.663]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:01.683 --> 02:35:01.903]  Stand up.
[02:35:01.943 --> 02:35:02.503]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:02.523 --> 02:35:02.983]  Stand up.
[02:35:03.003 --> 02:35:03.483]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:03.523 --> 02:35:03.823]  Stand up.
[02:35:03.843 --> 02:35:04.323]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:04.343 --> 02:35:04.503]  Stand up.
[02:35:04.543 --> 02:35:05.344]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:05.424 --> 02:35:05.664]  Stand up.
[02:35:05.764 --> 02:35:06.204]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:06.224 --> 02:35:06.444]  Stand up.
[02:35:06.464 --> 02:35:06.964]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:06.984 --> 02:35:07.224]  Stand up.
[02:35:07.244 --> 02:35:07.744]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:07.764 --> 02:35:08.025]  Stand up.
[02:35:08.045 --> 02:35:08.725]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:08.745 --> 02:35:09.005]  Stand up.
[02:35:09.045 --> 02:35:09.425]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:09.445 --> 02:35:09.645]  Stand up.
[02:35:09.665 --> 02:35:10.285]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:10.305 --> 02:35:10.485]  Stand up.
[02:35:10.505 --> 02:35:10.885]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:10.945 --> 02:35:11.146]  Stand up.
[02:35:11.166 --> 02:35:12.106]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:12.126 --> 02:35:12.446]  Stand up.
[02:35:12.466 --> 02:35:12.846]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:12.866 --> 02:35:13.146]  Stand up.
[02:35:13.166 --> 02:35:13.666]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:13.686 --> 02:35:13.906]  Stand up.
[02:35:13.926 --> 02:35:14.467]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:14.487 --> 02:35:14.947]  Stand up.
[02:35:14.967 --> 02:35:15.747]  Just leave me alone.
[02:35:15.767 --> 02:35:18.050]   Stand Peace!
[02:35:17.911 --> 02:35:26.310]  [Music]
[02:35:26.310 --> 02:35:33.710]   Now what people need to understand there, that was the formal dawn service of Waitangi Day.
[02:35:33.818 --> 02:35:35.238]  The Prime Minister was present.
[02:35:35.438 --> 02:35:38.259]  All the main political parties in Parliament were present.
[02:35:38.319 --> 02:35:41.880]  A lot of different nationalities, religions were there, opening up with prayer.
[02:35:42.220 --> 02:35:47.541]  Now this gentleman, he is Māori, but he was shut down by his own and he is a returned serviceman.
[02:35:47.601 --> 02:35:51.262]  He's fought for freedom and those two that shut him down were police officers.
[02:35:51.302 --> 02:35:52.422]  Kelvin, have you got anything to add?
[02:35:52.962 --> 02:35:59.628]  The large Māori gentleman who was trying to usher him away is the Northland Regional Commander.
[02:36:00.209 --> 02:36:04.232]  So, in these situations, especially around Waitangi, it's like anything else.
[02:36:04.292 --> 02:36:06.334]  You send your own to shut your own down.
[02:36:06.354 --> 02:36:09.777]  Well, that's what the state does, but otherwise it'll look racist, see?
[02:36:10.718 --> 02:36:14.361]  Poumea McKay, of course, is former New Zealand Special Air Service, New Zealand SAS.
[02:36:15.242 --> 02:36:20.743]   Been in Borneo, I think he exited the military because he had an injured back.
[02:36:20.743 --> 02:36:24.183]  I know him well, I've known him for over 23 years.
[02:36:24.183 --> 02:36:26.022]  That man has not changed his stance.
[02:36:26.022 --> 02:36:30.583]   He has continued to push back against the state and back in early 2000 he was a great
[02:36:30.583 --> 02:36:32.503]  advisor and trainer for our unit.
[02:36:32.503 --> 02:36:38.224]   So Donna, what do you think about this because the mainstream is trying to create a narrative
[02:36:38.224 --> 02:36:39.863]  here that the colonisers, i.e.
[02:36:39.953 --> 02:36:45.337]  the whites here in New Zealand, or the Pākehā, what they call them, are trying to shut Māori, the indigenous, down.
[02:36:45.577 --> 02:36:53.043]  But this is the case of your Māori, Paumea's Māori, and you are both being shut down by your own, aren't you, at a place where there should be free speech on Waitangi?
[02:36:53.203 --> 02:36:54.584]  Quick, women, did they go over in the segment?
[02:36:56.412 --> 02:36:59.534]  Yeah, I just want to go back to what he says about God's law.
[02:36:59.574 --> 02:37:04.877]  So there are fundamentals, four principles that underpin our democracy.
[02:37:05.377 --> 02:37:10.760]  One is God's law, the principles of natural justice, the rule of law, and man-made law.
[02:37:11.100 --> 02:37:19.505]  And what we're seeing, man-made law being statute law, is we're seeing the fundamental principles of our democracy being eroded.
[02:37:19.525 --> 02:37:23.287]  And this is what this koroua was trying to express.
[02:37:24.907 --> 02:37:31.498]  And we shut down, they're using tikanga, they're weaponising tikanga to shut us down.
[02:37:32.992 --> 02:37:47.199]  And so tikanga is Māori tradition and again they use the song to shut this man down and they're using it for their own ends because what's happening here in New Zealand is the iwi, which is the tribal leaders, are working with the corrupt governments.
[02:37:47.559 --> 02:37:56.883]  So he says in this, we're going to play his next explanation in this next segment when we come back so you can really understand exactly what the point was that he was trying to make.
[02:37:57.043 --> 02:37:59.124]  And it's an absolute beautiful message.
[02:38:00.004 --> 02:38:01.145]  When we come back we'll see it.
[02:38:01.730 --> 02:38:02.150]  Welcome back.
[02:38:02.190 --> 02:38:03.672]  You are live with the Alex Jones Show.
[02:38:03.692 --> 02:38:15.082]  In our previous segment, you would have seen Poumea McKay, a returned serviceman, who stood to clarify his position and basically make his voice known at the Waitangi Day celebrations here in New Zealand.
[02:38:15.102 --> 02:38:27.616]   A little difficult to get to the end of his because he was shut down in the manner he was and escorted off, not in a happy way of course. Now what we want to do is we want to now
[02:38:27.616 --> 02:38:32.646]   bring you what he was actually trying, the message he was trying to convey and this was shot by
[02:38:32.646 --> 02:38:38.655]   Papa Joe and we thank him for this footage and I think you the audience will realise that a lot more
[02:38:38.655 --> 02:38:45.056]   people around the world are coming to this conclusion and just let the video explain it for us.
[02:38:45.056 --> 02:38:53.776]   The war, the battle of words has never been Māori against Pākehā.
[02:38:54.439 --> 02:38:59.182]  It has always been Māori and Pākehā against their rogue governments.
[02:39:00.962 --> 02:39:02.403]  The government is our servant.
[02:39:03.103 --> 02:39:04.504]  But they're not acting as servants.
[02:39:05.265 --> 02:39:06.225]  They're acting as rulers.
[02:39:06.865 --> 02:39:07.966]  So I'm going to go over there.
[02:39:08.366 --> 02:39:11.728]  I've got in my satchel over there the laws that I've won in court.
[02:39:13.169 --> 02:39:13.469]  Where?
[02:39:14.069 --> 02:39:15.450]  That's why I want to join with you people.
[02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:16.750]  So we form up the Aupē.
[02:39:17.791 --> 02:39:19.492]  There is no law to make you pay tax.
[02:39:20.262 --> 02:39:22.183]  There's no law to have you register your vehicle.
[02:39:22.543 --> 02:39:24.324]  There's no law to have you drive a license.
[02:39:24.604 --> 02:39:24.845]  None!
[02:39:26.225 --> 02:39:26.786]  There's no law.
[02:39:28.066 --> 02:39:30.628]  They have been putting acts together in Parliament.
[02:39:30.888 --> 02:39:32.189]  Parliament is not sovereign.
[02:39:33.069 --> 02:39:33.750]  Simple as this.
[02:39:36.071 --> 02:39:40.994]  When you make a taiaha, can the taiaha rule over you?
[02:39:41.774 --> 02:39:42.014]  No.
[02:39:42.975 --> 02:39:44.455]  You rule over the taiaha.
[02:39:44.976 --> 02:39:48.157]  Until you pick it up and give it life, it's a dead thing.
[02:39:48.177 --> 02:39:48.958]  Okay?
[02:39:50.143 --> 02:39:51.884]  We living human beings, we give it a lot.
[02:39:51.964 --> 02:39:53.846]  Why did we spill our blood overseas?
[02:39:54.647 --> 02:39:55.847]  To have you come back and tell us?
[02:39:55.867 --> 02:39:57.529]  You're going to do that to us?
[02:39:58.489 --> 02:39:58.670]  No.
[02:39:59.690 --> 02:40:03.133]  I speak fiercely here, but when I go over there, I speak gently.
[02:40:03.153 --> 02:40:03.954]  Okay?
[02:40:04.454 --> 02:40:05.435]  Because we want to make friends.
[02:40:06.636 --> 02:40:13.221]  The real mark of a rangatira, when he faces his people, he is the public servant.
[02:40:15.023 --> 02:40:25.250]  But when he turns his back on the people, and the people are behind him, and he's facing the enemy, that's when he's the rangatira sovereign marshal.
[02:40:25.510 --> 02:40:25.830]  Why?
[02:40:26.230 --> 02:40:30.133]  Because he's backed by all the sovereign individuals behind him.
[02:40:31.114 --> 02:40:33.175]  It was the government that broke the treaty.
[02:40:33.875 --> 02:40:36.057]  Oh, yes, they were mostly part of it.
[02:40:36.097 --> 02:40:36.197]  OK?
[02:40:37.178 --> 02:40:38.839]  It's the government that's trying to hold us back.
[02:40:39.439 --> 02:40:42.301]  It's the government that's putting out all these mandates about COVID.
[02:40:43.562 --> 02:40:43.662]  OK?
[02:40:44.915 --> 02:40:46.316]  So we must band together.
[02:40:46.336 --> 02:40:49.859]  And our power comes from i o matua.
[02:40:50.619 --> 02:40:54.322]  Not from the fact that I have a direct descendant to the King Potatau.
[02:40:55.002 --> 02:41:00.646]  Not from the fact that I have a direct descendant from Patoane or Honeheke.
[02:41:01.027 --> 02:41:08.972]  No, our mana comes from the fact that I am a child of God and you and I are brothers.
[02:41:10.173 --> 02:41:11.594]  The Paha is my brother.
[02:41:11.614 --> 02:41:15.510]   Oh yes, You and I will sometimes get into a row, eh?
[02:41:16.572 --> 02:41:17.753]  There's a way to fix that!
[02:41:18.474 --> 02:41:18.815]  Okay?
[02:41:19.656 --> 02:41:26.887]  And we must concentrate on, think about the Ten Commandments, think about loving each other, okay?
[02:41:27.968 --> 02:41:29.010]  And then we'll move forward.
[02:41:32.128 --> 02:41:43.836]  Now, we do have a mixed history here in New Zealand with the Treaty of Waitangi and there's always been racial division, but Donna, he summed it up beautifully, didn't he, there, that we can all come together as one and really just love each other.
[02:41:43.856 --> 02:41:44.817]  Because there is a common enemy.
[02:41:46.618 --> 02:41:47.078]  That's right.
[02:41:48.259 --> 02:41:55.264]  And that koroua said it eloquently, actually, the common enemy is the government.
[02:41:55.584 --> 02:42:07.193]   You know, and he takes me back to 1986, because it's really important that we In New Zealand, understand how important 1986 is.
[02:42:07.494 --> 02:42:16.520]  1986 was a bloodless coup where the government gave itself sovereignty without the mandate of the people.
[02:42:16.901 --> 02:42:23.445]  So we can question from 1986 onwards whether or not they have legitimate power.
[02:42:24.926 --> 02:42:25.387]  Definitely.
[02:42:25.447 --> 02:42:26.828]  What are we going to do now, Donna?
[02:42:27.717 --> 02:42:45.051]  What we're going to do is bring in the other narrative that happened this week, as a whole lot of people went to a public meeting to see Christopher Luxon, who here in New Zealand is the leader of the Opposition Party, which is of course the National Party here, which is like the Republicans, but the Rhinos, not the true Patriots.
[02:42:45.351 --> 02:42:48.214]  They really are the sellouts to the globalist Deep State.
[02:42:48.494 --> 02:42:51.877]  So we're going to play you an introduction to that, about how Mainstream covered it.
[02:42:51.897 --> 02:42:53.418]  It took them 24 hours to cover it.
[02:42:53.678 --> 02:42:54.880]  There was over 500 people.
[02:42:54.940 --> 02:42:55.582]  We turned up.
[02:42:55.882 --> 02:43:02.353]  A whole lot of freedom-loving Patriot New Zealanders asked some tough questions and this is how Mainstream wrote about it.
[02:43:03.533 --> 02:43:09.135]  Hey listen, can I just say firstly, thank you so much for coming out and actually spending some time with us this afternoon.
[02:43:09.315 --> 02:43:11.696]  We're going to talk a little bit about the country.
[02:43:11.836 --> 02:43:25.541]  On February the 7th, Mr Christopher Luxon, the Leader of the Opposition in the New Zealand Parliament and Leader of the Conservative National Party, spoke at a Meet the People gathering in the rural town of Rangiora, just north of Christchurch.
[02:43:27.402 --> 02:43:31.504]  The meeting was attended by an enthusiastic crowd of four to five hundred people.
[02:43:33.189 --> 02:43:51.317]  During the question and answer session, several questions were raised about polarising co-governance issues determined by a racial divide that the current government is rolling out, such as woke education curricula including sexual identity and critical race theory, and of course, COVID jabs and mandates.
[02:43:52.697 --> 02:43:58.040]  However, when Counterspin Media started to ask the really hard questions, he scurried away.
[02:43:59.608 --> 02:44:01.509]  You have another question?
[02:44:01.549 --> 02:44:04.611]  Hey Chris, Chris, you're a businessman.
[02:44:04.631 --> 02:44:08.132]  I've got one more question, one more question for you, okay?
[02:44:08.192 --> 02:44:18.537]  You're a businessman, and I'm from Cantersford Media, and there's a lot of people here that want to know, are you going to find out what is in the Pfizer contract?
[02:44:18.677 --> 02:44:19.918]  Are you going to actually look at it?
[02:44:20.338 --> 02:44:27.409]   What did this government offer Pfizer to sell out this country and are you going to
[02:44:27.409 --> 02:44:29.719]  release the unredacted Pfizer contract?
[02:44:29.719 --> 02:44:34.719]  I'm going to get a taste of this.
[02:44:34.719 --> 02:44:38.719]  [crowd noise]
[02:44:38.719 --> 02:44:42.719]  [crowd noise]
[02:44:43.719 --> 02:44:47.719]  [crowd noise]
[02:44:47.719 --> 02:44:52.719]  [inaudible]
[02:44:52.346 --> 02:45:01.346]  [Cheering]
[02:45:01.346 --> 02:45:04.346]   You know, the voters are never wrong. They get to choose how we run the country.
[02:45:04.346 --> 02:45:08.346]  [Chatter]
[02:45:08.346 --> 02:45:12.346]   Chris, one single question. One single question, Chris, if that's possible.
[02:45:12.346 --> 02:45:16.346]  [Chatter]
[02:45:16.346 --> 02:45:24.346]   Enter the Foy to Jab rollout, including the bribery and corruption and the wholesale deaths of New Zealanders.
[02:45:24.447 --> 02:45:25.247]  Will you open up that?
[02:45:28.468 --> 02:45:33.750]  Well there we go ladies and gentlemen, what's happening here is that's Christopher Larkson, he's leader of of course the National Party.
[02:45:34.290 --> 02:45:38.271]  Basically part and parcel of the same body you have in Parliament.
[02:45:38.911 --> 02:45:41.212]  Nothing but, what are they?
[02:45:41.612 --> 02:45:43.313]  The cesspit of corruption.
[02:45:44.286 --> 02:45:54.889]  Couldn't answer a simple question, shut down the meeting quick as a flash as soon as people started talking about the jab, the deaths and all the corruption going on.
[02:45:55.789 --> 02:46:01.490]  But he's happy to make soundbites and waffle on forever saying absolutely nothing.
[02:46:01.689 --> 02:46:03.689]  And he just completely ignored you.
[02:46:03.689 --> 02:46:05.689]  [inaudible]
[02:46:05.689 --> 02:46:07.689]  [silence]
[02:46:07.689 --> 02:46:09.689]  [silence]
[02:46:09.689 --> 02:46:11.689]  Okay, there you go.
[02:46:11.409 --> 02:46:16.591]  That is our footage, actually, and we're going to show you the mainstream reporting when we come back.
[02:46:16.911 --> 02:46:29.017]  But Donna, what have you got to say to Kiwis who, in that clip, were standing up, were asking the hard questions, to the point where Christopher Luxon had to scurry off and shut that meeting down early because he was due to stay a lot later?
[02:46:29.037 --> 02:46:30.098]  We've got about 1 minute 15.
[02:46:33.443 --> 02:46:40.205]  That's why I asked for our Royal Commission, because the politicians don't want to debate this issue with us.
[02:46:40.265 --> 02:46:41.505]  It's an important issue.
[02:46:41.925 --> 02:46:45.426]  And instead they're shutting every single meeting down.
[02:46:45.446 --> 02:46:52.747]  We need courageous New Zealanders to get up and challenge them exactly the same way that you did, Hannah, the same way that I did.
[02:46:52.807 --> 02:46:58.248]  It takes some kahunas to do that, but we've got to do it for the sake of our children and our grandchildren.
[02:46:59.108 --> 02:47:01.649]  You know, we're in peril times.
[02:47:02.330 --> 02:47:12.943]  My father paid the ultimate price for that and someone needs to be held accountable for their actions and the buck stops with our Members of Parliament.
[02:47:13.962 --> 02:47:19.927]  And I will say that Calvin and I were waiting for the microphone because they did open it up to question time and Calvin they were ignoring it.
[02:47:20.027 --> 02:47:21.428]  Oh they weren't giving it to us.
[02:47:21.468 --> 02:47:22.809]  They were not wanting to give it to us.
[02:47:23.129 --> 02:47:29.474]  Yep, so in the end there once they'd shut the questions down I had to just take the opportunity to stand up and ask that hard question.
[02:47:29.494 --> 02:47:32.336]  When will the unredacted Pfizer contract be released?
[02:47:32.376 --> 02:47:41.583]  We want that worldwide because we want to know what did the New Zealand Government offer Pfizer to have our people injected with a toxin?
[02:47:43.450 --> 02:47:44.751]  We'll be right back after this.
[02:47:45.451 --> 02:47:52.514]  In the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, we are talking Christopher Luxon, the leader of the National Party here in New Zealand.
[02:47:52.814 --> 02:48:02.999]  Now, the other story with him this week was that, of course, the ongoing narrative about misogyny being a big player in attacking New Zealand female politicians.
[02:48:03.039 --> 02:48:10.680]   And I know Paul Watson has covered that as well over there in the UK, where they are trying to basically make it illegal to criticise females.
[02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:15.639]   But Christopher Luxon says no, there's no such thing as, you know, females getting more
[02:48:15.639 --> 02:48:17.399]  sojournistic abuse.
[02:48:17.399 --> 02:48:21.001]   He then later on in the day, earlier in the week, backtracked and said, oh no, they do
[02:48:21.001 --> 02:48:23.001]  get more gendered abuse.
[02:48:23.001 --> 02:48:25.319]   And what I would say, Kelvin- It's not election year, is it?
[02:48:25.319 --> 02:48:28.120]  Yeah, what I would say is yes, it's a gender abuse.
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:33.639]   Because any politician who is rolling out the deep state agenda will be criticised.
[02:48:33.639 --> 02:48:36.880]   And we won't stop just because if Luxon gets in as the next Prime Minister at the next
[02:48:36.880 --> 02:48:42.880]   election in October. He will also be criticised even though he's a man.
[02:48:40.928 --> 02:48:52.814]  Now we want to play the mainstream footage, the mainstream coverage and stuff which is a print internet based platform here in New Zealand and let's see how they covered that public meeting.
[02:48:52.874 --> 02:48:54.435]  And then we'll get Donna in for her comments.
[02:48:56.690 --> 02:49:00.773]  from Stuff, New Zealand's leading purveyor of misinformation and government propaganda.
[02:49:01.613 --> 02:49:06.256]  Christopher Luxon hijacked by anti-vaxxers and conspiracists, at packed public meeting.
[02:49:07.156 --> 02:49:09.998]  So, who then, are Stuff calling conspiracists?
[02:49:11.098 --> 02:49:18.720]  North Canterbury has more than its fair share of the lunatic fringe and diehard anti-vaxxers, incorrigible conspiracy theorists, and wacky obsessives.
[02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:27.282]  It houses Dr. Joni Girard, who handed out fake medical certificates to support vaccine exemptions, and the sign writer who forged vaccine passes.
[02:49:27.942 --> 02:49:32.843]  It's home to Derek Tate, the Harley-riding Destiny Church pastor who has led anti-mandate marches.
[02:49:33.522 --> 02:49:39.241]   The first sign of potential trouble is the arrival of far-right conspiracy theorist Kelvin Alp and his pregnant partner
[02:49:39.241 --> 02:49:39.842]  Hannah Spear.
[02:49:39.842 --> 02:49:48.682]  Yeah, and there you go.
[02:49:48.174 --> 02:49:51.515]  They were basically scared as soon as we walked in the door.
[02:49:51.876 --> 02:49:55.497]  Donna, what's your quick comment about the media coverage there?
[02:49:55.617 --> 02:49:59.099]  And then Kelvin's got a question for you from your legal background.
[02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:09.084]  Well, I've been called a conspiracy theorist, an extremist, tantamount to a domestic terrorist.
[02:50:12.443 --> 02:50:15.764]  So I've been called all the names under the sun by mainstream media.
[02:50:15.804 --> 02:50:16.384]  Here's the thing.
[02:50:16.824 --> 02:50:30.168]  I had my father's medical records and I said to them, I will give you my father's medical records so you can follow what had happened to him, that he didn't have a heart disease nor lung disease prior to the jab.
[02:50:30.808 --> 02:50:31.568]  And they didn't want it.
[02:50:33.008 --> 02:50:34.629]  So, you know, they only want...
[02:50:35.818 --> 02:50:37.879]  They only want their one source of truth.
[02:50:38.319 --> 02:50:40.019]  So, no, good on you.
[02:50:40.499 --> 02:50:48.861]  You know, they say, you know, I've been mocked for coming on to your show as well as a Māori, as an indigenous person of New Zealand.
[02:50:49.702 --> 02:51:01.804]  But you guys, you know, like they say... Because we are white supremacists and we are co-opting you and somehow we have this mystical power that is able to take control of your mind and make you white.
[02:51:02.545 --> 02:51:03.005]  Amazing.
[02:51:05.987 --> 02:51:13.070]  I am Māori, and as you can see with the tonga that I'm wearing, this is from my dad, he gave it to me on my fifth year.
[02:51:13.190 --> 02:51:21.153]  I've been a staunch advocate of our people, advocating for bread and butter stuff like a roof over their head, all those sorts of things.
[02:51:21.513 --> 02:51:30.617]  So no, I'm pretty staunch and I can stand my own ground, but thank you for giving me the opportunity to give a voice to my father and people like him.
[02:51:30.637 --> 02:51:36.130]   You're most welcome, and another thing that That I think was misrepresented in that stuffed article.
[02:51:36.150 --> 02:51:39.117]  We call it stuffed because they are absolutely stuffed with their reporting.
[02:51:39.137 --> 02:51:41.723]  It's Dr. Joanie Girard.
[02:51:42.759 --> 02:51:50.841]  It should have read, Dr Joni Gerrard, hero who saved thousands of people from being killed by government medical tyranny.
[02:51:51.001 --> 02:52:06.326]  And as far as we know, because she is American, she's actually gone back to America, so she's not even in the Christchurch area, but of course they have to bring her into that article to try and smear everybody because she went through the ringer and they tried to say she was doing fake vaccine exemptions and all that kind of thing.
[02:52:06.706 --> 02:52:09.947]  Now, we did want to ask you one more question before we wrap it up, Donna.
[02:52:10.427 --> 02:52:13.108]  This whole thing about indemnity with Pfizer.
[02:52:13.448 --> 02:52:14.789]  Now, is that possible?
[02:52:14.989 --> 02:52:17.650]  Kelvin, what was the extent of that question?
[02:52:18.190 --> 02:52:19.290]  The question was quite simple.
[02:52:19.851 --> 02:52:24.072]  As we know, Pfizer got indemnity from most governments across the world.
[02:52:25.173 --> 02:52:34.136]  They have obtained that indemnity by way of fraud because they knew that it was harmful from the outset.
[02:52:34.616 --> 02:52:41.015]   Can indemnity stand In your legal opinion, when it was obtained, via fraud?
[02:52:43.057 --> 02:52:45.219]  In my humble legal opinion, no.
[02:52:45.819 --> 02:52:46.600]  It's null and void.
[02:52:46.620 --> 02:52:47.961]  Their contract is null and void.
[02:52:48.242 --> 02:52:50.724]  Here's the other issue with their contract.
[02:52:51.124 --> 02:52:52.165]  What did they put up?
[02:52:52.466 --> 02:53:11.070]   What did our government put up as a sweetener, as a You know, were we going to lose any resources or assets if they didn't reach a certain number of JAB people?
[02:53:11.430 --> 02:53:20.756]  I mean, I'm just putting it out there, right, because it's the timing of the three waters, trying to nationalise the three waters.
[02:53:20.877 --> 02:53:27.301]  It's the timing around that, and there are other issues around that, but for me, for today, it's about the timing of it.
[02:53:27.762 --> 02:53:29.744]  Was our water put at risk?
[02:53:30.304 --> 02:53:31.625]  We don't know, do we?
[02:53:32.966 --> 02:53:33.887]  No, you're correct.
[02:53:33.927 --> 02:54:00.967]   In fact, there's a lot of countries now questioning that Pfizer contract because we have seen the Albanian one leak, I think, and there's another South American one that states we're basically military bases, ports, certain key real estate has been put up, certain state assets have been put up, and this is why the New Zealand Unredacted Pfizer contract has to be released to the public because we have not seen sight nor sign of it and that is another question that needs to be asked.
[02:54:01.187 --> 02:54:05.090]  The corruption in New Zealand is, that's the pandemic.
[02:54:05.790 --> 02:54:08.772]  And the deaths of people across this nation, that's the pandemic.
[02:54:09.193 --> 02:54:11.854]  There was no such thing as this COVID rubbish.
[02:54:12.655 --> 02:54:18.393]   Cold and flu took a bloody A holiday for two years, then all of a sudden, everyone's dying.
[02:54:18.413 --> 02:54:21.595]  Right in line with the introduction of the jab.
[02:54:21.615 --> 02:54:22.335]  Miraculous.
[02:54:22.375 --> 02:54:27.138]  Yeah, and we definitely want to congratulate New Zealanders this year.
[02:54:27.318 --> 02:54:32.441]  Of course, it is also the one-year anniversary of those protests down in Wellington.
[02:54:32.501 --> 02:54:40.628]   From the 1st to the 5th of March, there will be a commemorative kind of gathering in Dannyvirk in New Zealand. You can
[02:54:40.628 --> 02:54:44.509]   check that out on Facebook, the 2nd of March commemorations.
[02:54:44.509 --> 02:54:51.608]   Have you got any final words Donna of inspiration and encouragement for New Zealanders and how
[02:54:51.608 --> 02:54:55.827]   can they get involved in the Outdoors and Freedom Party if they do want to get
[02:54:55.827 --> 02:54:58.908]  political in this upcoming election season?
[02:54:58.908 --> 02:55:07.948]   What I just want to encourage people to do is to stand up, to stand up like I did, like
[02:55:07.948 --> 02:55:14.429]   the Koroua Poumea did, like Councillor Spindus, to stand up and even
[02:55:14.337 --> 02:55:17.218]  Because we're in election year and they're going to be campaigning.
[02:55:17.319 --> 02:55:19.560]  Every political party is going to be campaigning.
[02:55:19.940 --> 02:55:27.946]  Let's remember that the two establishment parties, what I say, are the left and right cheek of the same nono.
[02:55:29.898 --> 02:55:31.800]  And I'll let you explain what the law is.
[02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:33.261]  Shall we translate that?
[02:55:33.321 --> 02:55:35.383]  I'm sure you can use your imagination and work that out.
[02:55:38.646 --> 02:55:49.055]  So if we vote out Labour and vote in National, National said that, remember, don't forget what National said, that they were going to cut benefits.
[02:55:49.597 --> 02:55:52.339]  Of those that were on benefits if they didn't get the jab.
[02:55:52.639 --> 02:55:56.642]  So, you know, we've got the same people in power.
[02:55:57.142 --> 02:56:02.786]  Give New Zealand Outdoors and Freedom Party an opportunity to be your voice in Parliament.
[02:56:03.046 --> 02:56:04.487]  We can ask the hard questions.
[02:56:04.507 --> 02:56:06.609]  You can see that we can ask the hard questions.
[02:56:06.949 --> 02:56:08.950]  Sue is out there asking the hard questions.
[02:56:09.291 --> 02:56:13.353]  You can go to our website outdoorsparty.co.nz.
[02:56:13.393 --> 02:56:18.677]  You can go to our Facebook page forward slash NZ Outdoors and Freedom Party.
[02:56:19.102 --> 02:56:22.724]  Or our Twitter page, at NZOFP.
[02:56:23.664 --> 02:56:27.026]  Also, you can go to my Facebook page, Donna Pōkiri Phillips.
[02:56:27.747 --> 02:56:37.752]  We will continue to fight this important fight for ourselves, for those that have died, for those that are injured, for our children and for our grandchildren.
[02:56:39.941 --> 02:56:41.242]  Awesome, thank you so much Donna.
[02:56:41.522 --> 02:56:55.393]  And before Kelvin has his final wrap up, I just want to say thank you to all of you out there who have given us our wonderful messages because of course in that mainstream article you would have heard that yes, we are pregnant, we are expecting.
[02:56:55.413 --> 02:56:56.614]  You're welcome.
[02:56:57.214 --> 02:56:58.135]  My first child, yes.
[02:56:58.155 --> 02:56:58.715]  Thank you, honey.
[02:56:58.735 --> 02:57:00.956]  Our first child mid-May.
[02:57:01.396 --> 02:57:02.657]  It's Calvin's sixth child.
[02:57:02.997 --> 02:57:06.098]  So, you know, what better way... Someone's got to populate the earth with goodness.
[02:57:06.119 --> 02:57:06.379]  Exactly.
[02:57:06.439 --> 02:57:17.724]  What better way to combat the New World Order than to bring in new life and new beings that are going to stand and stand in truth and be the new world that we want to see.
[02:57:17.904 --> 02:57:24.658]   Natural, healthy, unjabbed, loved, Child.
[02:57:24.918 --> 02:57:27.560]  What's your final words to the people of New Zealand, Cohen?
[02:57:29.321 --> 02:57:32.902]  Stop allowing the government to divide you.
[02:57:33.983 --> 02:57:37.485]  Just because they're a different shade, it does not mean they are different.
[02:57:37.605 --> 02:57:39.486]  They still want the same for their children.
[02:57:39.806 --> 02:57:45.749]  They still have the same wish and desire to be free, to pursue their own happiness.
[02:57:46.209 --> 02:57:48.950]  If you cannot help someone, try not to hinder them.
[02:57:49.731 --> 02:57:52.252]  If you can't come together, leave them alone.
[02:57:53.095 --> 02:57:57.637]  The only time there should have ever been intervention is if someone's life is in danger.
[02:57:57.657 --> 02:58:03.939]  The police are there or should be there to keep the peace and protect people from harm of another.
[02:58:04.179 --> 02:58:09.841]  They are not there to inflict harm upon them by international puppeteering dictates.
[02:58:09.921 --> 02:58:13.402]  And we will be bringing you more information on Pamela Taylor as it comes to hand.
[02:58:13.682 --> 02:58:15.663]  This medical tyranny in New Zealand needs to stop.
[02:58:15.582 --> 02:58:32.342]  We will see you again here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:32.385 --> 02:58:33.486]  You're a sponsor of the show.
[02:58:34.047 --> 02:58:34.768]  You support us.
[02:58:34.828 --> 02:58:39.273]  It's not the main reason I had you on today, but usually you're hard to even get to plug the products when you're on.
[02:58:39.693 --> 02:58:41.756]  But you've got so many great Made in America products.
[02:58:42.316 --> 02:58:45.780]  And if people go to your sites and use promo code Alex, they get even bigger discounts.
[02:58:46.181 --> 02:58:48.023]  But tell folks about this new pillow you've got.
[02:58:48.823 --> 02:58:50.464]  Yeah, this is a big announcement.
[02:58:50.524 --> 02:58:52.966]  When I invented my pillow, that was in 2004.
[02:58:53.406 --> 02:58:54.387]  It took a year to invent.
[02:58:54.967 --> 02:58:56.028]  Nothing ever changed.
[02:58:56.068 --> 02:58:58.329]  It was the best patented fill, the best.
[02:58:58.349 --> 02:59:02.031]  Remember, sleep is about height and staying there, and temperature.
[02:59:02.552 --> 02:59:10.537]  Well now, I found out about a year and a half ago about temperature regulating thread that's made here in the U.S.
[02:59:10.837 --> 02:59:16.519]   So I have this fabric made And I said, you know, let's make an exclusive MyPillow fabric.
[02:59:16.779 --> 02:59:18.660]  Let's see if it works with the great patented feel.
[02:59:19.100 --> 02:59:20.880]  I've slept on it now for two months.
[02:59:21.301 --> 02:59:23.841]  This stuff is cool to the touch.
[02:59:23.901 --> 02:59:26.302]  You're not going to be flipping that pillow to the cool side.
[02:59:26.762 --> 02:59:29.023]  It is the most, the best pillow in history.
[02:59:29.043 --> 02:59:30.263]  Just got even better.
[02:59:30.703 --> 02:59:32.624]  And we're doing the buy one, get one free.
[02:59:33.753 --> 02:59:38.117]  We just actually got these into production last week.
[02:59:38.658 --> 02:59:45.343]  And the commercial for it, it was one of our big movie commercials we made where the one in the mirror, that comes out in about 10 days.
[02:59:45.383 --> 02:59:49.747]  So you're getting them here, one of the first ones to get them in the country.
[02:59:50.288 --> 02:59:53.310]  And trust me, it brings sleep to a whole new level.
[02:59:53.610 --> 02:59:55.292]  They're absolutely the best pillow ever.
[02:59:56.252 --> 03:00:02.675]  You have great products, hundreds of great products, but more importantly, you're using the money to fight the New World Order fearlessly.
[03:00:02.695 --> 03:00:11.218]  That's why everybody should shop for their sheets and their pillows and their beds and their dog beds and their slippers and everything at MyPillow.com.
[03:00:11.298 --> 03:00:13.098]  You've got the great bath rubs, everything.
[03:00:13.458 --> 03:00:20.601]  And just use promo code to get the big discount, promo code A-L-E-X, and that keeps this show on air as well.
[03:00:24.232 --> 03:00:29.858]  If you go to OnlineHealthNow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the Wellness Company.
[03:00:29.998 --> 03:00:33.822]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the company.
[03:00:33.862 --> 03:00:36.225]  I contribute like so many else do.
[03:00:36.285 --> 03:00:38.247]  There are so many wonderful doctors.
[03:00:38.407 --> 03:00:44.033]  Far and away, the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's Detoxification Supplement.
[03:00:44.133 --> 03:00:45.734]  That features natokinase.
[03:00:45.854 --> 03:00:47.976]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[03:00:48.196 --> 03:00:53.861]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[03:00:53.881 --> 03:00:54.642]  This is very important.
[03:00:54.662 --> 03:00:59.506]  The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[03:00:59.706 --> 03:01:01.187]  People are low with the spike protein.
[03:01:01.207 --> 03:01:02.068]  They don't feel well.
[03:01:02.168 --> 03:01:03.789]  This is a potential solution.
[03:01:03.889 --> 03:01:06.852]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[03:01:06.932 --> 03:01:09.714]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[03:01:09.854 --> 03:01:10.815]  Isn't it interesting?
[03:01:11.215 --> 03:01:17.086]  Natural substances, in a sense, combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines.
[03:01:17.307 --> 03:01:21.815]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support and thank you for getting into that because it's important.
[03:01:21.835 --> 03:01:23.438]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
