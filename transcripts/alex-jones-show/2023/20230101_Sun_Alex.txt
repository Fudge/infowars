[00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:08.951]  If you think gun control or something like that is gonna change a terrorist's point of view, I think you're, like, out of your mind.
[00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:12.572]  You may think you've got me worried about what you're gonna do.
[00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:15.334]  Dude, you're about to find out what I'm gonna do.
[00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:17.334]  And that's gonna worry you a lot more.
[00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:20.536]  Lawdawg, you don't step aside, we'll tear you apart.
[00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:24.157]  You die first, get it?
[00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:29.099]  Your friends might get me in a rush, but not before I make your head into a canoe, you understand me?
[00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.380]  He's bluffing, let's rush him.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.580]  No!
[00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:34.001]  He ain't bluffing.
[00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:35.502]  I'm not as stupid as you look, Ike.
[00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:39.903]  Yeah, I don't understand the concepts of conversation of the gun culture.
[00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:45.024]  We've lived with guns since, what, the 7th century or something, I don't know.
[00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:50.886]  We all know that right now, guns is a term, it's a metaphor that disenfranchised white guys need.
[00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:53.846]  It makes them feel good because they're being- You can say what you want, I don't agree with that.
[00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:58.409]   There's a big difference between Fantasyland In reality, Fantasyland is what we do.
[00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.310]  Doing a movie, doing a television show, that's Fantasyland.
[00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.951]  And that's where that stuff belongs.
[00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:10.134]  In reality, when we're dealing with things like terrorism and whatnot, we're all going to have different opinions on how to do it, how to deal with it.
[00:01:10.294 --> 00:01:23.382]   Mine happens to be that I think there's a very strong reason Founding Fathers had for the Second Amendment, and that is that no government ever Hasn't had to fight its own people, and its own people hasn't had to fight its own government.
[00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:24.063]  So what are you gonna do?
[00:01:24.463 --> 00:01:25.004]  Outlaw everything?
[00:01:25.324 --> 00:01:26.105]  That ain't the answer.
[00:01:26.305 --> 00:01:29.809]  Just put some... Put some controls?
[00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:33.833]  What, so the people who want to defend themselves can't?
[00:01:34.113 --> 00:01:35.775]  No, not so you can't.
[00:01:35.815 --> 00:01:37.457]  Just so the idiots can't get hold of us.
[00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:39.179]  Do you really believe they're not going to?
[00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.681]  Are you serious about that?
[00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:42.121]  Are you seriously?
[00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:42.702]  What?
[00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:43.582]  Good will that?
[00:01:43.742 --> 00:01:46.063]  Oh my God.
[00:01:46.083 --> 00:01:47.564]  We had our Civil War.
[00:01:47.644 --> 00:01:56.408]  If that Second Amendment hadn't been there, those people would not have had the opportunity to do what they considered was defending their life, their way, their style of living.
[00:01:57.048 --> 00:01:58.909]  So, I agree with that.
[00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:05.993]  I think that's an important part of our existence, and it's basically that simple.
[00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:07.553]  InfoWars.
[00:02:08.034 --> 00:02:10.795]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:16.026]  It's called the Great Reset.
[00:02:16.827 --> 00:02:17.307]  Tough guy.
[00:02:18.528 --> 00:02:19.609]  It's called the New World Order.
[00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:29.676]  It's called the big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can loan us fiat money to take control of our lives with a social credit score and a universal basic income.
[00:02:29.736 --> 00:02:30.777]  That's everything.
[00:02:31.057 --> 00:02:32.879]  That's the whole future of our lives.
[00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:38.443]  The whole world's gonna be about surveillance and control and them manipulating and tracking everything you do.
[00:02:38.463 --> 00:02:39.964]  It's all being officially announced.
[00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:41.385]  I've got articles everywhere.
[00:02:41.445 --> 00:02:49.456]   There are press releases saying And then the crew asked me during the break, they go, are you alright?
[00:02:49.496 --> 00:02:50.918]  You really seem upset.
[00:02:50.998 --> 00:02:51.918]  Are you feeling okay?
[00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:53.920]  Atlanta's about to have a nuclear war.
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.723]  I mean, they're gonna starve a couple hundred million people to death.
[00:02:56.783 --> 00:02:57.823]  Yeah, I'm pretty freaked out.
[00:02:57.884 --> 00:02:58.824]  Yeah, this is real.
[00:02:59.285 --> 00:03:03.285]  This is not a freaking game to me, man.
[00:03:03.285 --> 00:03:07.285]  You understand, like, I love losing, right?
[00:03:07.285 --> 00:03:09.285]  But I mean, let me tell you that, guys.
[00:03:09.285 --> 00:03:14.285]   People are already starting to have hundreds of millions right now.
[00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:15.533]  You'll never see it on the news.
[00:03:15.713 --> 00:03:16.873]  They're dying right now.
[00:03:16.993 --> 00:03:27.218]  They're in their freaking houses, starving to death, begging for God to help them, and no one's coming because God tells us to get up and take action, and then we don't do anything!
[00:03:27.598 --> 00:03:31.639]  And that paralyzes God!
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.940]  Yeah, God can do it.
[00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.471]  But God needs us to do it, because God's not free will.
[00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:42.755]  Once again, not for the first time, what had seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned out to be true.
[00:03:42.795 --> 00:03:43.356]  Yeah, I'm upset.
[00:03:43.376 --> 00:03:46.959]  I'm really... I told you last night, I said, what's wrong with you?
[00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:48.200]  I'm really freaked out.
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.681]  I'm like, God, I'm really freaked out!
[00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:51.362]  I'm really freaked out!
[00:03:51.602 --> 00:03:53.043]  I'm really freaked out!
[00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:54.504]  You see, because this is real!
[00:03:55.285 --> 00:03:58.908]  The supply chain being cut off, the energy grid being cut off is real!
[00:04:02.014 --> 00:04:04.978]  And we're going into a time now where we're not going to be on the air.
[00:04:04.998 --> 00:04:12.267]  I mean, if we don't back this off, if we don't get sane people to stop the globalists, I mean, we won't be here in six months.
[00:04:12.087 --> 00:04:26.586]  Because you won't be here at 6/12.
[00:04:26.535 --> 00:04:27.616]  InfoWars.com.
[00:04:27.797 --> 00:04:28.918]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:04:29.038 --> 00:04:29.879]  InfoWars.com.

[00:04:37.028 --> 00:04:39.591]  You must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[00:04:39.771 --> 00:04:40.312]  Alex Jones.

[00:04:43.577 --> 00:04:44.759]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:45.620]  He knows who Impole is.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.082]  They're playing his joke over here.
[00:04:47.262 --> 00:04:48.604]  That's why the de-platforming didn't work.
[00:04:48.765 --> 00:04:52.110]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.990]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:03.990]  You wanna beat the new world order?
[00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.360]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:13.061]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.

[00:05:22.343 --> 00:05:26.764]  The bad news is, the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[00:05:27.004 --> 00:05:28.665]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.

[00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:58.391]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action!
[00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:01.391]  [Music]
[00:06:01.391 --> 00:06:08.391]  [Music]
[00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:16.391]  Another world, another time, in the age of wonder.
[00:06:16.925 --> 00:06:26.511]  Another world, another time, as life was green and good, until there was black.
[00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:33.774]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:34.434 --> 00:06:40.458]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:48.139]   Watching the vandalism of civilization, watching the purposeful destruction of human society and culture
[00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:53.139]  repeat again in mass war under new names is very painful.
[00:06:53.139 --> 00:07:00.139]   But it's up to those of us that are aware of this to persevere and continue civilization on to rebuild after.
[00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:06.139]   Well, we couldn't have a more important, informative guest on today to cover the waterfront.
[00:07:06.895 --> 00:07:08.417]  He's Dr. Francis Boyle.
[00:07:09.775 --> 00:07:19.545]  He's an author, researcher, lawyer, took a special PhD, only one person gets a year at Harvard, that Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski took, that teaches them how the whole new world order works.
[00:07:19.585 --> 00:07:23.710]  He was the top war crimes prosecutor, people like Slobodan Milosevic at the UN.
[00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.911]  He wrote the U.S.
[00:07:24.991 --> 00:07:52.178]   Law on Chemical and Biological Weapons, contributed to the world law, and he's here to talk about The waterfront today, the huge escalation, as he pointed out, on the escalation ladder the Pentagon uses, the full-on total nuclear war, we'll also look at the gain of function coming out, the fact that it's now confirmed the deep state was censoring scientists and doctors and others that were exposing the truth, and we'll also
[00:07:53.237 --> 00:07:58.081]  Look at the poison COVID shots and so much more with him, the Twitter files.
[00:07:58.481 --> 00:07:59.402]  There's so much to cover.
[00:07:59.422 --> 00:08:02.665]  So I'm going to try to let Dr. Boyle start wherever he wishes.
[00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:05.647]  It's great to have him on with us here today.
[00:08:06.107 --> 00:08:07.328]  Dr. Boyle, thank you so much.
[00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.091]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[00:08:11.492 --> 00:08:12.292]  Merry Christmas.
[00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:13.233]  Happy New Year.
[00:08:13.273 --> 00:08:17.056]  Happy holidays there to all your audience.
[00:08:18.477 --> 00:08:19.938]  I know you're not about being vindicated.
[00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:24.763]   You don't want the credit, but you also Need folks to know, The Gravitas, you're a serious guy.
[00:08:25.264 --> 00:08:41.073]  You were on the air in late January and early February 2020 on my show and other shows, predicting it was out of a lab, predicting the shots would be poisoned, predicting war would follow, predicting world ID cards, predicting the shots would cause mass death.
[00:08:41.493 --> 00:08:51.499]   So out of all the pantheon of great people, the Dr. Robert Malone's and the Dr. Michael Yeadon's, You have been the most on target and the early bird in all this.
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:57.004]  So I know you want to get into the war in Ukraine and expanding and that existential threat.
[00:08:57.404 --> 00:08:58.044]  I want to hit that.
[00:08:58.064 --> 00:09:00.746]  But first, total vindication, Dr. Boyle.
[00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:01.887]  It's like you had a crystal ball.
[00:09:03.689 --> 00:09:15.437]  Well, Alex, a lot of this credit goes to you because you're the only person in the mainstream news media that would let me talk about these things.
[00:09:16.738 --> 00:09:24.761]  I first blew the whistle on it on January 24, 2020, in a worldwide alert.
[00:09:25.902 --> 00:09:37.366]  The dangers here that COVID-19 was an offensive biological warfare weapon that had leaked out of the Wuhan BSL-4.
[00:09:38.166 --> 00:09:52.846]   And then later on, on your program, I said that any frankenshots That big pharma developed here would be more dangerous than useless.
[00:09:53.707 --> 00:10:08.859]  And then later on, on your show, I said messenger RNA is very powerful stuff to inject into your body and it could discombobulate your entire genetic system.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:20.653]   Now, I said that very early on, as you correctly pointed out, In early February to you and on InfoWars and some of your colleagues.
[00:10:20.774 --> 00:10:27.777]  So kudos to you and to InfoWars for letting me speak the truth to the American people.
[00:10:28.558 --> 00:10:35.481]  But how did you, I mean I know you wrote the bioweapons laws and were a top prosecutor at the UN, but just how did you nail it?
[00:10:35.561 --> 00:10:36.842]  So you totally nailed it.
[00:10:39.986 --> 00:10:42.047]  Well, we've discussed this before.
[00:10:42.187 --> 00:11:06.339]  I think the most important point now, from my perspective, are these proposed regulations by the World Health Authority and also the proposed pandemic treaty by the World Health Organization that are now under consideration over in Geneva.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:36.481]   I have read both the Regulations and the tree, and according to either one or both, they will establish a scientific and medical police state that will cover the entire world and that will usurp and negate the sovereignty of the United States of America
[00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:53.437]  As well as the sovereignty of the states of the Union under the 10th Amendment of the United States Constitution and penetrate right down to our primary care physicians.
[00:11:54.117 --> 00:12:02.481]  You will have Dr. Tedros there, the WHO, telling our medical doctors how to treat us.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.691]  This will be a one-way path to the cemetery for all Americans.
[00:12:09.393 --> 00:12:23.937]   And right now, we must get organized to defeat The WHO regulations and the WHO treaty on future... And let's be clear, you're a guy that writes U.S.
[00:12:23.997 --> 00:12:24.318]  and U.N.
[00:12:24.338 --> 00:12:24.898]  regulations.
[00:12:24.918 --> 00:12:27.260]  There couldn't be a better guest to describe this.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:35.988]  You've read the treaty, you've read the regulations, and you're saying what we've been hearing is true, that it is a worldwide, biomedical, big pharma, corporate police state.
[00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:38.030]  That's correct.
[00:12:38.110 --> 00:13:02.067]   And as a matter of fact, Alex, I've researched, studied and taught international organizations, starting from my student days at Harvard Law School up until today, beginning with the first Hague Peace Conference of 1899, up through and including the United Nations organization.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:14.563]  You can read about this in my book, Foundations of World Order, Duke University Press, 1999, which was half of my PhD dissertation at Harvard.
[00:13:14.723 --> 00:13:19.143]  So yes, I've done this work professionally for all those years.
[00:13:19.884 --> 00:13:42.486]   Indeed, the most insidious part of the WHO tree, from my perspective, Uh, is that the concluding clause has been drafted so that it will come into effect immediately upon signature by Biden's delegate.
[00:13:43.407 --> 00:13:44.368]  Let me repeat that.
[00:13:44.408 --> 00:14:02.617]   It will come into effect immediately upon signature for Biden's delegate Despite the requirements of the United States Constitution that all treaties must receive the advice and consent of the United States Senate.
[00:14:03.358 --> 00:14:23.802]   A clear-cut usurpation of our Constitution, as well as the 10th Amendment, Guaranteeing that all rights not delegated to the federal government reside in the hands of the states, the union, or the people.
[00:14:24.362 --> 00:14:44.276]   And so what will happen under this treaty and also under the regulations, people like Governor DeSantis, Governor Abbott, and others who do not accept the party line coming out of the CDC We'll be sideset and usurped.
[00:14:44.636 --> 00:14:45.637]  And that was my next question.
[00:14:45.657 --> 00:14:46.397]  We'll come back for a break.
[00:14:46.417 --> 00:14:52.080]  We'll get into the World Treaty and more than get into the war in Ukraine that's currently the big, obviously the front-burner threat.
[00:14:52.841 --> 00:14:58.344]  But what do you make of the German Vice President saying, we need investigations, criminal investigations.
[00:14:59.084 --> 00:15:04.607]  The Supreme Court three days ago green-lighting criminal investigations in Florida.
[00:15:04.647 --> 00:15:05.888]  That's got to be encouraging.
[00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.729]  Right.
[00:15:07.869 --> 00:15:18.037]   I have read the Request for a grand jury that Governor DeSantis filed with the Florida Supreme Court.
[00:15:18.798 --> 00:15:25.107]  And then I have read the terms of reference given by the Florida Supreme Court.
[00:15:26.238 --> 00:15:40.752]  They are broad enough, in my opinion, to include indictments against everyone involved here for murder and conspiracy to commit murder in accordance with Florida law.
[00:15:41.272 --> 00:15:42.774]  I want you to remember two words.
[00:15:42.613 --> 00:15:43.613]  would include...
[00:15:43.613 --> 00:15:44.613]  Dr. Boyle, stay there.
[00:15:44.613 --> 00:15:45.613]  I'm going to try to shut up, give me the floor.
[00:15:45.613 --> 00:15:49.613]   Let's come back with that, finish up with COVID and then get into the World War III
[00:15:49.613 --> 00:15:53.452]   situation and that ladder of escalation you warned of two months ago on the show that
[00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.613]  we've now moved up several rooms on.
[00:15:55.613 --> 00:15:56.613]  Wow.
[00:15:56.613 --> 00:15:57.613]  Dr. Francis A. Boyle is our guest.
[00:15:57.613 --> 00:15:58.613]  Stay with us.
[00:15:58.613 --> 00:16:06.332]  I want you to remember two words, InfoWars Platinum.
[00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:12.173]   In the history of InfoWars supplements, and they're amazing, this is hands down the most
[00:16:12.173 --> 00:16:18.012]   powerful game-changing products we've ever offered to the public.
[00:16:16.316 --> 00:16:23.721]  Now, all three of these are private labels of three national bestsellers put out by a pharmaceutical company that also makes high-end supplements.
[00:16:24.062 --> 00:16:25.663]  And the owners are listening and a supporter.
[00:16:25.982 --> 00:16:31.901]   So they're giving them to us at 40% off what they're sold on stores, over 20% off what
[00:16:31.901 --> 00:16:36.501]  they're sold online under the InfoWars Platinum brand name.
[00:16:36.501 --> 00:16:37.501]  These are incredible.
[00:16:37.501 --> 00:16:43.982]   Pain MD, HGH Max Boost, and of course 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[00:16:43.982 --> 00:16:48.782]   Read about them at InfoWarsStore.com, learn about them, and then try them out for yourself.
[00:16:48.782 --> 00:16:51.982]  And I know you will be a repeat customer, which is awesome.

[00:16:57.452 --> 00:17:00.394]  InfoWars Platinum, now available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:07.464]  Oh, Fenton of the Communist Chinese Dragon here to give you stupid Americans your orders.
[00:17:08.125 --> 00:17:09.646]  Do not save InfoWall.
[00:17:10.106 --> 00:17:15.670]  Do not be part of their year-end fundraiser at InfoWallStore.com with huge sales.
[00:17:16.051 --> 00:17:17.972]  Do not click on the donation button.
[00:17:18.492 --> 00:17:20.714]  Give up, roll over, and die.
[00:17:21.234 --> 00:17:23.376]  InfoWall is more influential than ever.
[00:17:23.796 --> 00:17:25.237]  It's important to shut them down.
[00:17:25.558 --> 00:17:27.879]  So I'm ordering you now in the name of CCP.
[00:17:27.979 --> 00:17:30.219]  Do not go to Infowarsstore.com!
[00:17:30.219 --> 00:17:34.219]  Happy birthday to you!
[00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:50.219]  No fear!
[00:17:50.219 --> 00:17:57.219]  Vaccinate your children before they kill us all.
[00:17:57.332 --> 00:18:00.552]  Brought to you by the World Health Organization.
[00:18:00.732 --> 00:18:02.313]  Adrian in Pennsylvania, welcome.
[00:18:02.653 --> 00:18:03.653]  Oh, hey, this is awesome.
[00:18:03.773 --> 00:18:11.495]  I want to thank you for the Real Red Pilt Plus coming back in, because for two years, my mom has not stopped talking about, is it going to get it back in?
[00:18:11.555 --> 00:18:12.715]  Is it going to come back in?
[00:18:12.895 --> 00:18:20.256]  I even looked at the bottle for the formulation to see if I can match it with the Heron beer to get some other stuff, but there's just too much going on in there.
[00:18:20.316 --> 00:18:23.597]  Well, describe for us what it did for your mother, because it really helps old folks.
[00:18:23.717 --> 00:18:25.998]  Well, my mom has a lot of health problems.
[00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:29.239]  She's been on disability for years, since I was probably about 12.
[00:18:29.919 --> 00:18:30.319]  I'm 40 now.
[00:18:30.479 --> 00:18:33.780]  And between that, the turmeric, the X2, she feels amazing.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.421]  The only thing that she would want me to have is Wednesday down and out coming back.
[00:18:37.581 --> 00:18:38.481]  Well, that's our problem.
[00:18:38.501 --> 00:18:41.782]  We haven't had enough money to order all the products we used to have, and that's why we're in a catch-22.
[00:18:41.822 --> 00:18:49.305]  That's why I may need to just do our fundraiser to try to get, like, $400,000 or $500,000 to then buy a product, and then we can sell it and then make a profit.
[00:18:49.665 --> 00:18:50.965]  And it's kind of a self-fulfilling deal.
[00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:51.805]  That's how that works.
[00:18:52.286 --> 00:18:53.046]  Talk a farmer.
[00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:55.331]  We'll have that last crop.
[00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:58.353]  If they don't have enough money to buy more seed the next year, they got to shut down.
[00:18:59.194 --> 00:19:02.356]  And so we're kind of at that nexus point of really needing more support.
[00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:06.399]  We're in the catch-22 of selling things at discounts, so not enough money comes in.
[00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:10.742]  But I've got some fundraising ideas in the new year that should help keep us on air.
[00:19:10.762 --> 00:19:16.666]  If everybody just buys the products we've got now and Real Red Pill Plus is back, we'll be able to stay on air.
[00:19:16.686 --> 00:19:17.447]  But it's very close.
[00:19:18.928 --> 00:19:32.359]  So a challenge and a proposal I have for listeners is I didn't buy products for years, but I love the information and I woke people up and it was very, very popular because people were very surprised that there was something else actually happening outside of the mainstream media.
[00:19:32.399 --> 00:19:36.882]  And then I started to buy the product and started to feel amazing and then get other people to buy the product.
[00:19:36.902 --> 00:19:41.726]  So if you're a listener who doesn't buy products, you're taking something special away from this broadcast.
[00:19:41.786 --> 00:19:43.267]  Thank you so much for the call, Adrian.
[00:19:43.106 --> 00:19:45.505]   Give it to a friend, use it yourself, give it to a loved one.
[00:19:45.505 --> 00:19:46.747]  Because we are in a war.
[00:19:46.747 --> 00:19:51.786]   So in order to keep you alive through this process, with all the information we're gonna need,
[00:19:51.786 --> 00:19:56.747]   especially into the future, I would say buy one product a month and use it,
[00:19:56.747 --> 00:19:59.267]  give it to somebody, but keep it open and keep it going.
[00:19:59.267 --> 00:20:01.226]  Thank you so much for the call, Adrian.
[00:20:01.226 --> 00:20:08.567]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.567 --> 00:20:11.145]  (upbeat music)
[00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:14.726]  (upbeat music)
[00:20:14.726 --> 00:20:17.307]  (upbeat music)
[00:20:18.307 --> 00:20:25.307]   All right, Dr. Francis A. Boyle, author, researcher, man that wrote the US--
[00:20:25.137 --> 00:20:27.983]  Biological Chemical Weapons Law, former U.N.
[00:20:28.264 --> 00:20:29.246]  war crimes prosecutor.
[00:20:31.024 --> 00:20:31.925]  Got caught up by the break.
[00:20:31.965 --> 00:20:36.787]  He was getting into the German vice president saying he wants an investigation of the shots.
[00:20:37.428 --> 00:20:41.470]  The criminal investigation launched by the state of Florida and more.
[00:20:42.571 --> 00:20:49.855]  And then finishing up with all the gain of function news and what's coming out and what he thinks the deep state's going to do now because they're being so exposed.
[00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:55.998]  Elon Musk coming out pointing out that Fauci's wife runs the bioethics board that controls what he can do.
[00:20:56.018 --> 00:21:00.521]   I mean, is this whole incestuous Bio-weapons program comes out.
[00:21:00.561 --> 00:21:01.762]  Looks like it's blown up in their face.
[00:21:02.142 --> 00:21:03.163]  Please continue, Dr. Boyle.
[00:21:04.704 --> 00:21:04.924]  Right.
[00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:10.988]  Again, one point to drive home for your audience to understand.
[00:21:11.668 --> 00:21:15.891]  Trump pulled us out of the WHO for good cause.
[00:21:16.371 --> 00:21:17.632]  I agree with that decision.
[00:21:18.352 --> 00:21:27.818]  One of the first steps Biden made as president was to put us back into the WHO and he appointed Tony Fauci.
[00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:29.587]  As the U.S.
[00:21:29.647 --> 00:21:35.370]  government's representative on the Executive Council of the WHO.
[00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.411]  Now think about that for a minute.
[00:21:38.031 --> 00:21:44.193]  That's where the WHO treaty and the WHA regulations are coming from.
[00:21:44.734 --> 00:21:45.474]  Tony Fauci.
[00:21:46.227 --> 00:21:49.348]  And on that, we've discussed Fauci before.
[00:21:49.868 --> 00:21:54.390]  You can read Bobby Kennedy's book on the real Anthony Fauci.
[00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:55.731]  It's all in there.
[00:21:56.171 --> 00:22:24.210]   So it's clear what happened here is that Fauci and his ilk Like Bill Gates, like Big Pharma, like the biowarfare industry, when they saw the opposition coming from American people and governors and other elected officials, decided to do an Enron around all of us.
[00:22:24.911 --> 00:22:52.329]   By going to the WHO and drafting these regulations and this treaty, That will set up a worldwide scientific medical police state under the control of Tedros and Bill Gates and the biowarfare industry, big pharma and the Chinese Communist government that gives a lot of money to the WHO.
[00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:56.733]  That is what is confronting us today, Alex.
[00:22:57.292 --> 00:23:04.372]   As citizens of the United States of America, we have to stop these WHA regulations.
[00:23:04.372 --> 00:23:12.532]   We must stop this WHO treaty if we want to live in freedom here in the United States.
[00:23:12.532 --> 00:23:19.171]   Again, you've read the treaty, you've read the regulations, and that's what I've seen
[00:23:19.171 --> 00:23:21.052]  Congress people say the same thing you've said.
[00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:21.927]  I've looked over as well.
[00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:23.608]  It looks like the U.N.
[00:23:23.628 --> 00:23:26.669]  gets control of pandemic response, but then the U.N.
[00:23:26.849 --> 00:23:31.672]  I saw their hearings three years ago before the pandemic was announced in December of 2019.
[00:23:33.092 --> 00:23:38.355]  The head of their vaccine program said, we're just told by the big pharma what to say about these shots.
[00:23:38.395 --> 00:23:39.275]  We don't even test them.
[00:23:39.756 --> 00:23:40.316]  So the U.N.
[00:23:40.356 --> 00:23:41.416]  itself, if the U.N.
[00:23:41.456 --> 00:23:44.518]  will be in control under this treaty, who's in control of the U.N.? ?
[00:23:47.762 --> 00:23:50.466]  Well, you know, you get what you pay for.
[00:23:50.486 --> 00:23:53.991]  He who pays the piper calls the tune.
[00:23:54.131 --> 00:23:55.753]  I mean, the U.N.
[00:23:55.873 --> 00:24:00.039]  is a rotten, corrupt and despicable organization.
[00:24:00.655 --> 00:24:43.831]   When I was the lawyer for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war and genocide against them, the United Nations, the European Union, its member states, and Bill Clinton at UN headquarters in Geneva, Tried to carve up the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina into three little bitty pieces of land, rob Bosnia of their UN membership, destroy their statehood under international law, and subject 1.5 to 2 million more Bosnians to ethnic cleansing when we already had 2 million victims of ethnic cleansing.
[00:24:44.171 --> 00:24:45.211]  Now, I stopped them.
[00:24:45.752 --> 00:24:46.672]  It never happened.
[00:24:47.173 --> 00:24:51.735]  Bosnia and Herzegovina is still there today, and they have their U.N.
[00:24:51.775 --> 00:24:52.296]  membership.
[00:24:52.696 --> 00:24:56.218]  But that's what they were going to do to the poor Bosnians.
[00:24:58.179 --> 00:25:00.560]  So you've lived the predatory nature of the U.N.
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.581]  I want to get into all the other big subjects, but you're a U.N.
[00:25:03.641 --> 00:25:07.563]  insider, a guy that, you know, tried to reform it but couldn't, obviously, but did some good work there.
[00:25:08.344 --> 00:25:09.364]  What is the U.N.
[00:25:09.404 --> 00:25:09.584]  now?
[00:25:09.924 --> 00:25:12.886]  Basically a corporate front group of corporate fascists, or what is it?
[00:25:14.378 --> 00:25:19.000]  I think corporate fascist is a good description, certainly for the U.N.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.240]  Secretariat, right?
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:21.941]  I think that's a good description.
[00:25:21.961 --> 00:25:26.022]  Yeah, so the general bodies are debating Club of No Power, but the actual U.N.
[00:25:26.062 --> 00:25:28.343]  and the Security Council, that's fascist.
[00:25:29.663 --> 00:25:32.144]  Well, the Secretariat, the bureaucracy, right.
[00:25:32.224 --> 00:25:38.467]  And then they control the specialized agencies like the WHO, sure.
[00:25:38.527 --> 00:25:40.547]  And we all know the WHO.
[00:25:40.687 --> 00:25:41.528]  Could the U.N.
[00:25:41.568 --> 00:25:42.448]  be reformed?
[00:25:45.012 --> 00:25:46.613]  I really don't know at this point.
[00:25:46.933 --> 00:25:51.834]  My assessment, Alex, was when I was at the U.N.
[00:25:51.874 --> 00:25:58.316]  headquarters in Geneva and they were trying to destroy the Bosnians, a U.N.
[00:25:58.356 --> 00:26:24.275]   member state, it struck me that historically this was at the situation Of the inevitable decline of the League of Nations, when Haile Selassie appeared in the exact same location I was, and appealed for the League to save Abyssinia from Mussolini and his fascists, and they did nothing.
[00:26:24.795 --> 00:26:28.759]  So I regret to say the UN is on decline.
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:33.041]  That's a great example of when the Ethiopian leader tried to stop that.
[00:26:33.101 --> 00:26:35.602]  And that could have stopped World War II if they had done something then.
[00:26:38.023 --> 00:26:38.863]  It could have, sure.
[00:26:39.323 --> 00:26:39.883]  But they didn't.
[00:26:40.023 --> 00:26:43.284]  And indeed, in the case of the Bosnians, it was far worse.
[00:26:43.784 --> 00:26:45.025]  They tried to get rid of us.
[00:26:46.145 --> 00:26:47.125]  And I stopped them.
[00:26:47.405 --> 00:26:48.106]  Yes, I did.
[00:26:48.466 --> 00:26:49.426]  And you're on record doing that.
[00:26:49.466 --> 00:26:50.706]  You've done so many amazing things.
[00:26:50.767 --> 00:26:54.888]  I know when I asked you to talk about how you know all this, you just moved on to the next subject.
[00:26:54.928 --> 00:26:56.708]  But your knowledge is just incredible.
[00:26:56.748 --> 00:26:58.149]  I mean, it's amazing to be able to pick your brain.
[00:26:58.973 --> 00:27:00.774]  We got two minutes to break.
[00:27:01.195 --> 00:27:02.415]  What subject do you want to go to next?
[00:27:04.417 --> 00:27:07.779]  Well, we can move on to Ukraine if you want to, sure.
[00:27:07.979 --> 00:27:08.460]  Let's do that.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.181]  Give us a prelude of what's coming up.
[00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:17.913]  Well, if we don't stop Biden, we're going to have a direct war with Russia.
[00:27:18.073 --> 00:27:27.620]  Right now, there is an indirect war, a de facto state of war between the United States and Russia.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.483]  Even Foreign Minister Lavrov has said that.
[00:27:32.023 --> 00:27:38.327]  So we're going to have to stop the Bidenites before they continue up this ladder of escalation.
[00:27:38.788 --> 00:27:40.169]  You have the list there.
[00:27:41.249 --> 00:27:47.272]  The con letter, a letter of escalation developed by Rand and the Pentagon.
[00:27:47.812 --> 00:27:52.954]  And if you skip down just a little bit, you'll see we're at stage 20.
[00:27:53.494 --> 00:27:57.855]  The no nuclear use threshold.
[00:27:57.876 --> 00:27:58.556]  We're right there.
[00:27:59.036 --> 00:28:00.997]  Peaceful worldwide embargo.
[00:28:01.457 --> 00:28:01.697]  Right.
[00:28:01.757 --> 00:28:06.879]  That's exactly what we have today against the Russian Federation.
[00:28:07.943 --> 00:28:16.930]  Biden and the European Union member states are waging economic warfare against the Russian Federation.
[00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:25.936]  We, in my opinion, I think we're one step below the nuclear threshold there, as identified by Herman.
[00:28:25.976 --> 00:28:27.457]  And that's what you said two months ago on the show.
[00:28:27.477 --> 00:28:28.558]  That's what Lavrov said yesterday.
[00:28:28.598 --> 00:28:30.699]  He said, we're entering the nuclear threshold.
[00:28:30.719 --> 00:28:31.720]  This needs to stop now.
[00:28:33.266 --> 00:28:33.466]  Right.
[00:28:33.626 --> 00:28:34.687]  It has to stop now.
[00:28:35.187 --> 00:28:40.971]  And yet you will see the Bidenites refuse, adamantly refuse to negotiate.
[00:28:42.392 --> 00:28:45.054]  Just the other day, Putin said he will negotiate.
[00:28:45.554 --> 00:28:47.495]  Lavrov would say they will negotiate.
[00:28:47.916 --> 00:28:49.276]  The Bidenites refuse.
[00:28:49.597 --> 00:28:51.438]  And of course, Zelensky refuses.
[00:28:51.778 --> 00:28:52.719]  But he's our puppet.
[00:28:53.179 --> 00:28:54.560]  Zelensky tells whatever.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.482]  Well, let's talk about what comes next with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[00:29:00.097 --> 00:29:12.109]  Everybody knows that I love a win-win situation, and that I coined the term a 360 win, another way of saying a non-zero-sum game, where there are no losers, everybody are winners because it's a symbiotic relationship.

[00:31:03.055 --> 00:31:07.276]  What I would do as president is several more things because things have changed.
[00:31:07.696 --> 00:31:12.358]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[00:31:12.738 --> 00:31:14.359]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:15.599]  They deserve to be heard.
[00:31:15.619 --> 00:31:16.479]  That's who we are.
[00:31:16.819 --> 00:31:20.620]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:21.501]  We don't have borders.
[00:31:21.761 --> 00:31:22.481]  We don't have language.
[00:31:22.501 --> 00:31:23.161]  We don't have culture.
[00:31:23.361 --> 00:31:25.142]  We're a tower of babble that will fall.
[00:31:25.242 --> 00:31:28.543]  That is the famed Rio Grande River right there.
[00:31:28.903 --> 00:31:30.584]  This man said, surge the border.
[00:31:30.644 --> 00:31:33.486]  This man now has said, good job, you've got courage doing this.
[00:31:33.506 --> 00:31:36.508]  This is ten times the surge that they've ever seen!
[00:31:36.548 --> 00:31:38.609]  Ten times what it was under Obama!
[00:31:38.689 --> 00:31:42.111]  And now it's gonna get ten times worse, and ten times worse after that!
[00:31:42.231 --> 00:31:45.053]  So the border is completely gone!
[00:31:45.413 --> 00:31:48.635]  Shocking footage of just a massive, massive caravan.
[00:31:48.655 --> 00:31:50.416]  They estimated more than 10,000 people.
[00:31:50.516 --> 00:31:54.278]  Hours after hour after hour after hour after hour.
[00:31:54.298 --> 00:31:56.419]  24-7 flooding into Texas.
[00:31:56.599 --> 00:31:59.120]  Complete human exploitation on a grand scale.
[00:32:01.581 --> 00:32:07.003]  You're about to run a human being over.
[00:32:07.464 --> 00:32:09.084]  You got those smuggled children illegally.
[00:32:09.144 --> 00:32:10.925]  This is a massive smuggling.
[00:32:10.965 --> 00:32:13.126]  This is literally human smuggling.
[00:32:13.326 --> 00:32:15.486]  All of this is a giant criminal fraud.
[00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:17.547]  You ought to be citizen arrested for what you're doing.
[00:32:17.767 --> 00:32:20.068]  Shame on you aiding and abetting child trafficking.
[00:32:20.288 --> 00:32:24.930]  All these people are signed on to criminal activity, the smuggling of children illegally.
[00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:29.774]  Massively expanding this facility, part of the United Nations program, to collapse our border.
[00:32:30.034 --> 00:32:43.786]  They come across, they walk through the gate, they get picked up by Border Patrol in a bus, they get taken to a facility, then they take them and put them into these Democrat facilities, Catholic Charities and others, and they come right back out, and they're put on a plane, or they're put on a bus, or they're put on a train, and just shipped anywhere in the U.S.
[00:32:43.806 --> 00:32:50.452]  But then all of us as citizens need to have COVID passports to travel, and there's checkpoints and apps and, you know, all this crap.
[00:32:50.392 --> 00:32:57.392]  This is globalism.
[00:32:57.392 --> 00:33:04.392]  This is globalism.
[00:33:04.392 --> 00:33:07.111]  The lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:07.021 --> 00:33:08.781]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.781 --> 00:33:18.388]   Big Brother Mainstream media.
[00:33:19.448 --> 00:33:20.589]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:21.229 --> 00:33:22.670]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.631]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:25.471 --> 00:33:30.154]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.256 --> 00:33:38.804]  Folks are really waking up to the city lockdowns and the climate lockdowns that are being announced.
[00:33:39.746 --> 00:33:40.687]  The 15-minute cities.
[00:33:40.707 --> 00:33:45.995]  I just had a very well-known podcaster text me and ask, is this real?
[00:33:47.054 --> 00:33:47.895]  And yes, it's real.
[00:33:48.295 --> 00:33:49.255]  We've been covering it for years.
[00:33:49.315 --> 00:33:55.559]  But tomorrow, I'm just going to open the show up, no matter how big the news is, with the 15-minute cities and the U.N.
[00:33:55.599 --> 00:33:58.680]  lockdowns, the climate lockdowns, and all the rest of it.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.762]  But we're talking to Dr. Francis A. Boyle right now, who wrote the U.S.
[00:34:02.242 --> 00:34:04.884]  Biological Chemical Weapons Laws, was a top U.N.
[00:34:04.904 --> 00:34:38.324]   war crimes prosecutor and more, and who's the most accurate person predicting almost three years ago, starting in January of 2020, what was going to unfold and happen So, we were continuing on, we hit the break with Russia and this escalation ladder, a generalized scenario, the Rand Corporation and the Pentagon, and that we're at point 20, what point 44 means, and where this huge escalation is going, and what the neocons and the crazy Democrats think they're doing.
[00:34:38.364 --> 00:34:38.944]  Please continue.
[00:34:41.519 --> 00:34:55.949]  Well, again, we saw this massive propaganda campaign by the Bidenites to bring Zelensky over here and try to get support from the American people in Congress.
[00:34:56.792 --> 00:35:03.679]  For this existentially dangerous war against Russia that is going on right now.
[00:35:03.699 --> 00:35:16.592]  I teach the laws of war and I would say right now with Russia, we are in a de facto state of war with Russia.
[00:35:17.552 --> 00:35:24.175]  It is not yet a de jure state of war with Russia, but is certainly de facto.
[00:35:24.695 --> 00:35:31.838]  And again, Foreign Minister Lavrov, who's a very experienced consummate diplomat, has said the same thing here.
[00:35:32.439 --> 00:35:34.199]  So it's extremely dangerous.
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.121]  Anything could set this off.
[00:35:38.301 --> 00:35:48.945]   And then rather than de-escalate the situation, Biden and the Democrats bring Zelensky over here to escalate.
[00:35:49.365 --> 00:35:52.727]  Well, this is like, imagine if Kennedy vacationed in the U.S.
[00:35:52.767 --> 00:35:57.228]  Virgin Islands for two weeks during the Cuban Missile Crisis, he'd be impeached.
[00:35:57.948 --> 00:36:02.530]  Shouldn't we move, as you pushed four months ago, to impeach Biden immediately for war crimes?
[00:36:04.491 --> 00:36:06.312]  Well, yes, that's true.
[00:36:06.372 --> 00:36:22.360]  But let's compare this to the Cuban Missile Crisis, because I think it's very instructive that for Russia, this is even more dangerous than the Cuban Missile Crisis in reverse.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:28.684]   Because in our case, Cuba was 90 miles south of Florida.
[00:36:29.704 --> 00:36:31.606]  This is right on their borders.
[00:36:32.146 --> 00:36:39.070]  And the second thing I think we need to consider is that Biden is no JFK.
[00:36:40.091 --> 00:36:53.379]  Whatever you think of JFK, he volunteered for combat during World War Two and performed heroically, courageously, and was seriously injured.
[00:36:53.914 --> 00:37:14.119]  Well, Biden's done nothing with his career but be on the payroll of there in Delaware, of Wall Street and the banksters and everyone else who does their corporate headquarters in Delaware, because that's the most... That's right, Kennedy engaged a Japanese destroyer with a small patrol boat and got his back broken.
[00:37:14.159 --> 00:37:16.039]  And we know the whole story, very heroic.
[00:37:16.579 --> 00:37:24.281]   And then meanwhile, if we go up this chain of what's happening, It's very apocalyptic to have Biden vacationing while this is going on.
[00:37:25.911 --> 00:37:26.111]  Right.
[00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:30.533]  And, you know, Kennedy tried to de-escalate.
[00:37:30.993 --> 00:37:53.861]  Most of his advisors on the executive committee, except for Anthony Stevenson here in the state of Illinois, and Undersecretary of State George Ball, who was a friend of mine, tried to restrain everyone else on the executive committee from invading Cuba that would have set off a nuclear war.
[00:37:54.641 --> 00:37:57.362]  LLM and Sir Curtis LeMay, all of them wanted to go to full war.
[00:37:58.563 --> 00:37:59.143]  That's correct.
[00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:02.264]  It would have very quickly become nuclear war.
[00:38:02.424 --> 00:38:02.644]  Yes.
[00:38:03.125 --> 00:38:06.046]  Well, whose restraint on Biden?
[00:38:06.246 --> 00:38:09.267]  Indeed, who's really home there with Biden?
[00:38:09.667 --> 00:38:15.589]  I regret to say, I think Biden is in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease.
[00:38:15.609 --> 00:38:15.829]  I agree.
[00:38:15.849 --> 00:38:19.531]  So let's go up this ladder here, because you bring this up and now even the Russians are bringing up the ladder.
[00:38:20.031 --> 00:38:21.432]  So you've got one up to 20.
[00:38:22.812 --> 00:38:25.594]  Peaceful, in quotes, worldwide embargo blockade.
[00:38:25.995 --> 00:38:29.897]  Then we move to local nuclear war, which Labaron and others are saying is next.
[00:38:30.418 --> 00:38:32.239]  Then declaration of limited nuclear war.
[00:38:32.259 --> 00:38:40.925]  And then we've got local nuclear war, military, unusual, provocative and significant countermeasures, evacuation.
[00:38:42.199 --> 00:38:46.421]  26th demonstration of attack on zone of interior.
[00:38:46.741 --> 00:38:50.522]  Well that we've kind of skipped ahead with all these cruise missile attacks inside Russia.
[00:38:50.762 --> 00:38:52.823]  How big a provocation is that in the last month?
[00:38:53.223 --> 00:38:56.745]  Just like they've kind of skipped ahead here to internal provocations in Russia.
[00:38:59.306 --> 00:39:10.871]  Well, again, yes, it does appear they're trying to provoke Russia into more substantial military action against them.
[00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:23.293]   We have to understand, whatever the Ukrainian military is doing today, Has been greenlighted by the Pentagon and the Biden administration.
[00:39:23.813 --> 00:39:32.317]  And all these attacks into Russia itself rely on US GPS coordination.
[00:39:32.697 --> 00:39:33.937]  So the Russians know this.
[00:39:34.017 --> 00:39:35.038]  They've even said this.
[00:39:35.578 --> 00:39:44.886]  That basically it's the Americans using the Ukrainians to engage in direct attacks against Russia.
[00:39:45.607 --> 00:39:57.817]  And the Bidenites, if you read the news media, have made it clear that they don't believe that the Russians are serious about any of their red lines.
[00:39:58.417 --> 00:40:06.481]  And so they are going to keep pushing up this ladder of escalation, which makes it extremely existentially dangerous.
[00:40:06.501 --> 00:40:14.044]  So why would the Pentagon and NATO openly be running the attacks, coordinating them, and trying to escalate Russia to a full military commitment?
[00:40:17.146 --> 00:40:26.950]  The Pentagon believes we have escalation dominance at every ladder, at every rung of that ladder.
[00:40:27.552 --> 00:40:30.196]  That we can control and dominate.
[00:40:30.216 --> 00:40:35.244]  So they're pushing and tricking the Russians into pulling into Poland and invading Russia.
[00:40:35.744 --> 00:40:36.566]  But in reverse.
[00:40:37.932 --> 00:40:45.297]  Well, again, it's the lessons learned from the Cuban Missile Crisis, which I think were the wrong lessons.
[00:40:46.218 --> 00:40:56.125]  But that's by Thomas Schelling of Harvard, ahead of me in the government department, his arms and influence, where Schelling talked about compellence.
[00:40:56.686 --> 00:41:05.192]  Namely, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, we had escalation dominance all up that ladder of escalation.
[00:41:05.792 --> 00:41:15.658]  And therefore, because of this escalation dominance at every stage, eventually we compelled Khrushchev to back down.
[00:41:15.898 --> 00:41:17.019]  But let's look at those maps.
[00:41:17.519 --> 00:41:18.920]  We totally destroy Russia.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.241]  We just lose half our cities.
[00:41:20.721 --> 00:41:21.722]  It's a Pyrrhic victory.
[00:41:22.242 --> 00:41:26.785]  So in their ladder of dominance, they win, but America gets destroyed.
[00:41:27.045 --> 00:41:27.906]  That is very sick.
[00:41:30.396 --> 00:41:38.118]  Well, I think they believe they can get the Russians to back down without it coming to that.
[00:41:38.898 --> 00:41:52.081]  Again, when Khrushchev looked at the ICBM balance during the Cuban Missile Crisis, he concluded there was no way we could prevail here, and he backed down.
[00:41:52.641 --> 00:42:07.734]  So that's, I believe, the way the Pentagon is looking at now, from the perspective of Kahn's Ladder of Escalation, their doctrine of escalation dominance, and Schelling's game theory analysis.
[00:42:07.815 --> 00:42:10.497]  So this is next-level Russian roulette for the whole world?
[00:42:12.085 --> 00:42:13.367]  That's the way I see it, yes.
[00:42:13.427 --> 00:42:25.784]  And remember, at the very height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the CIA set up a U-2 over there, over Soviet Union, to provoke them.
[00:42:26.785 --> 00:42:28.628]  The Soviets shot it down.
[00:42:29.335 --> 00:42:49.214]  And instead of overreacting, Kennedy continued with his back-channel diplomacy with Khrushchev through his brother and Ambassador Dobrynin, saying, quote, there's always some son of a bitch down the line who doesn't get the word, unquote.
[00:42:49.854 --> 00:42:55.719]  So, Alex, in this game of Russian roulette, something can always go wrong.
[00:42:56.179 --> 00:42:58.161]  Someone does not get the work.
[00:42:58.181 --> 00:42:58.701]  Well, that's right.
[00:42:58.721 --> 00:43:00.242]  Let's talk about how to end this peacefully.
[00:43:00.262 --> 00:43:03.144]  All right, Austin, I think my mic's back up.
[00:43:05.446 --> 00:43:11.010]  Sir, shouldn't we abolish the Federal Reserve and the CFR?
[00:43:11.591 --> 00:43:14.473]  That's the real reality that none of you will talk about and most of you are members.
[00:43:15.253 --> 00:43:16.995]  That's what's destroying this country, Governor.
[00:43:19.106 --> 00:43:20.607]  Don't you stand for America, sir?
[00:43:21.168 --> 00:43:24.450]  What about the Federal Reserve and the CFR?
[00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:25.710]  You people are being lied to.
[00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:27.211]  This country's been taken over by Europe.
[00:43:27.672 --> 00:43:28.772]  And I'm being drug out for it.
[00:43:28.592 --> 00:43:29.592]  Laugh at it!
[00:43:29.592 --> 00:43:37.592]  Let's grab an arm.
[00:43:37.918 --> 00:43:40.720]  Where's the car?
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:41.661]  I got some cuffs.
[00:43:41.501 --> 00:43:43.501]  Let's take him right here.
[00:43:43.501 --> 00:43:44.501]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:43:44.501 --> 00:43:50.501]  Step back.
[00:43:50.501 --> 00:43:53.501]   I'm going to ask you one more time, and then I'm going to tell you to step back.
[00:43:53.501 --> 00:43:55.501]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:43:55.501 --> 00:43:57.501]  They search for disarmed.
[00:43:57.929 --> 00:43:58.610]  All right, they're ready for me.
[00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.950]  Let's go.
[00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:00.411]  Come over and get the pretty little red light.
[00:44:01.192 --> 00:44:01.412]  Come on.
[00:44:01.592 --> 00:44:02.493]  Isn't that pretty?
[00:44:02.653 --> 00:44:06.956]  And they'll put a nice little clinic in here in the next few years for urine and blood testing like Clinton wants.
[00:44:07.236 --> 00:44:08.257]  What do I have to hide?
[00:44:08.297 --> 00:44:08.817]  I'm a criminal.
[00:44:08.877 --> 00:44:14.662]  Your photograph, they capture your signature, they capture your thumbprint, and now Clinton wants urine and blood?
[00:44:14.942 --> 00:44:15.883]  Is there a religious exception?
[00:44:18.302 --> 00:44:19.503]  Everyone must take the mark.
[00:44:20.023 --> 00:44:21.864]  A digitally enhanced mark.
[00:44:22.204 --> 00:44:24.666]  Just because you lay around doesn't mean it's not true.
[00:44:25.247 --> 00:44:26.668]  This is not a publicity stunt.
[00:44:26.688 --> 00:44:30.110]  I was a lot happier years ago before I got into all this garbage.
[00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:31.651]  I'm sick of sheep laying down.
[00:44:31.731 --> 00:44:33.212]  I wish you'd get up and do something.
[00:44:33.853 --> 00:44:41.398]  Our forefathers went to World War II and World War I and fought the Civil War to end slavery and it means nothing to y'all.
[00:44:41.418 --> 00:44:41.698]  Hello.
[00:44:41.738 --> 00:44:45.541]  Can I help you?
[00:44:46.622 --> 00:44:46.782]  Yeah.
[00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:50.690]   I'm just here to watch a child kidnapped and government sanctioned.
[00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:52.690]  Did you violate my policy?
[00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:54.690]  Policy? I called the First Amendment.
[00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:55.690]  Yes, sir.
[00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:59.690]   Those are the policy here at Bracken Ridge, and you are required to sign and violate my civil rights.
[00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:00.690]  Let's do it.
[00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:07.798]   They allowed terrorists from somewhere in the world, who the state sponsored because of the sophistication of this,
[00:45:07.798 --> 00:45:09.690]  to engage in this sinister activity.
[00:45:09.777 --> 00:45:14.360]  Something particularly pleasing was happening for the Bohemian Grovers.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:22.345]  With whatever developed with that crowd of men in black and brown and the bound body on the back of the buggy.
[00:45:22.385 --> 00:45:26.228]  They drove behind big black tarps they had hanging out of the trees.
[00:45:26.668 --> 00:45:31.571]  There was lots of smacking of lips and bizarre enjoyment by the crowd.
[00:45:31.611 --> 00:45:33.633]  We still haven't made out exactly what was going on.
[00:45:34.213 --> 00:45:39.161]  But that a real sacrifice may have actually been developed, according to some occult experts.
[00:45:39.301 --> 00:45:41.524]  DeltaVirus has fallen!
[00:45:43.768 --> 00:45:48.768]  The new world order of all media is falling!
[00:45:48.768 --> 00:45:53.768]  Humanity is rising!
[00:45:53.768 --> 00:46:07.768]  1776! 1776! 1776! 1776! 1776! 1777!
[00:46:07.768 --> 00:46:11.768]   Hitler took the guns. Stalin took the guns. Mao took the guns.
[00:46:11.902 --> 00:46:16.222]   that el castro took the guns yugoslaves took the guns and i'm here to tell you
[00:46:16.222 --> 00:46:30.862]   1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms you think the awakening machine so far is big this planet
[00:46:30.862 --> 00:46:41.541]   and the globalists have not seen anything yet you're about to run a human being over you got those
[00:46:41.541 --> 00:46:48.722]   children in there you got those - No swindle-sheltering legal. - Hey, it's legal!
[00:46:48.436 --> 00:46:50.697]  Hey, where are you?
[00:46:50.737 --> 00:46:51.537]  Where are you?
[00:46:51.477 --> 00:46:57.477]  You can watch this video in its entirety right now at Band.Video.
[00:46:57.477 --> 00:47:08.477]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.477 --> 00:47:15.397]  [MUSIC]
[00:47:15.441 --> 00:47:19.623]  Just Google his name, Dr. Francis A. Boyle, and find his dozens of amazing books.
[00:47:20.083 --> 00:47:21.184]  You'll learn how the world works.
[00:47:21.864 --> 00:47:34.489]  The last ten and a half minute segment we have here on this Wednesday edition, I want to talk about the nature of the Anglo-American establishment and what they're going to do next, but I wanted to finish up with my questions with this.
[00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:40.712]  We look at this escalation ladder that we know the Pentagon still uses, we know the Rand Corporation developed.
[00:47:41.408 --> 00:47:44.769]  And that now is being quoted in the news, once Dr. Boyle talked about it.
[00:47:45.209 --> 00:47:48.450]  We move up here from 1 to 20 where we're at right now.
[00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:51.090]  We're skipping ahead with some of the attacks inside Russia, 26.
[00:47:51.151 --> 00:47:56.352]  We move up into formal declaration of general war.
[00:47:56.652 --> 00:47:58.752]  They're basically doing that now with Zelensky visiting.
[00:47:59.273 --> 00:48:00.353]  Slow motion, counter.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:08.600]   property war, slow motion counterforce war, constrained force reduction salvo,
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:13.239]   constrained disarming attack, oh we just got an attack to stop their offensive, counterforce
[00:48:13.239 --> 00:48:21.159]   with evidence attack, unmodified counterforce attack, and now the really bad ones, slow motion
[00:48:21.159 --> 00:48:28.999]   and it goes on with augmenting disarming attacks, civilian devastation attack
[00:48:28.999 --> 00:48:34.840]   when they hit our cities, some other kinds of control, general war, spasm of intense war,
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:39.079]   we just nuke everything, they nuke everything, and it's just fire everything, total insanity.
[00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:40.691]  Kind of end of the world as we know it.
[00:48:41.331 --> 00:48:45.993]  Most estimates even say a limited nuclear war will cause a breakdown of civilization and kill billions.
[00:48:46.373 --> 00:48:48.614]  A total nuclear war, they think probably 7 billion.
[00:48:49.074 --> 00:48:50.675]  There'll be a billion people left, maybe.
[00:48:51.215 --> 00:48:53.676]  Dr. Boyle, your comments on this ladder of escalation?
[00:48:55.252 --> 00:49:00.772]  Alex, that's the Pentagon's war plan for Ukraine right now as we speak.
[00:49:01.508 --> 00:49:26.006]  I believe that's their draft war plan, and that's what they plan to do there at the Pentagon, and the Bidenites will sign off on it, moving up those stages of escalation, pursuant to their theory of escalation dominance, that they have escalation dominance, until the Russians back down.
[00:49:26.647 --> 00:49:27.608]  That's the way they see it.
[00:49:27.648 --> 00:49:30.270]  Explain escalation dominance for folks that haven't studied this.
[00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:36.013]  In layman's terms, they believe every step of the escalation, quote, the U.S.
[00:49:36.033 --> 00:49:40.015]  will be in charge and controlling it, even though it'll be totally destructive to both sides.
[00:49:40.416 --> 00:49:54.004]  They believe they're going to come out in the end on top, which is what Dr. Strangelove is all about, based on some real events and some real battle plans of where the Pentagon and Curtis LeMay and Limitzer tried to push a nuclear war to Kennedy, saying it'll be survivable.
[00:49:54.404 --> 00:49:57.406]  Yeah, we'll lose 30, 40 million Americans, but we'll win in the end.
[00:49:58.006 --> 00:49:59.407]  And he said, I'm not a mass murderer.
[00:50:01.707 --> 00:50:03.028]  Alex, you're basically right.
[00:50:03.128 --> 00:50:28.416]   Again, I believe, pursuant to their doctrine of escalation dominance, which goes back to Tom Schelling, a head of me at Harvard, that they believe they control every rung of that ladder of escalation you see there by Kant, and that they believe that at some point, The Russians will back down and we will prevail.
[00:50:28.636 --> 00:50:30.197]  What if the Russians jump ahead?
[00:50:30.217 --> 00:50:32.378]  What if the Russians don't follow the latter?
[00:50:34.839 --> 00:50:37.600]  Well, they very well might not, Alex.
[00:50:38.221 --> 00:50:52.928]  I really don't know, except my reading of the situation is that President Putin, and not to defend Putin at all, I've been up against Putin too, he's very cautious.
[00:50:53.892 --> 00:51:10.343]  And moves one step at a time throughout this entire crisis, starting with the overthrow of the democratically elected government of Ukraine by Obama and Biden.
[00:51:10.923 --> 00:51:21.430]  Remember, Obama put Biden in charge of the entire Ukraine project, and he has been in charge of it since then.
[00:51:23.598 --> 00:51:24.499]  How do we stop this?
[00:51:26.622 --> 00:51:38.617]  Well, I think, Alex, what we have to do is to go back to the pledge that Jim Baker gave to Soviet Commissar Gorbachev.
[00:51:39.384 --> 00:51:51.513]  Namely, that in return for Gorbachev agreeing to the reunification of Germany, NATO would not move even one inch to the east.
[00:51:52.074 --> 00:51:58.679]  That pledge was binding as a matter of international law, even though it wasn't in writing.
[00:51:59.299 --> 00:52:01.220]  And to his credit, Bush Sr.
[00:52:01.981 --> 00:52:03.222]  adhered to that pledge.
[00:52:03.782 --> 00:52:11.907]  It was then Clinton and the Democrats who came into power and wantonly violated that pledge.
[00:52:12.347 --> 00:52:22.454]  And let me point out here that the foreign policy guru and stengali for the Democratic Party has been Brzezinski.
[00:52:23.235 --> 00:52:40.582]  Since the days of Jimmy Carter, and indeed the Jimmy Carter campaign, when he was head of the Trilateral Commission there, paid for by David Rockefeller, and they co-opted Carter into the presidency.
[00:52:41.366 --> 00:52:52.614]  Then Bush Jr., under the influence of his neocons, publicly stated they wanted Ukraine and Georgia to join NATO.
[00:52:53.134 --> 00:53:15.685]   This precipitated the war by Georgia against Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia, and then the current crisis in Ukraine, Victoria Nuland, the The infamous role that she played over there in promoting the coup d'etat.
[00:53:16.225 --> 00:53:21.348]  And now she is Biden's number three official in the State Department.
[00:53:21.488 --> 00:53:29.614]   So if you want proof that the neocons are in charge of what Biden's doing, Let me ask you this.
[00:53:30.194 --> 00:53:40.621]  Why are we seeing the Pope come out in the last six months three times, and even Kissinger three times, including last week, saying, we need a peace deal now, this is a nuclear war, this is out of control, stop it.
[00:53:40.921 --> 00:53:50.448]  When even Kissinger, who is like the omnibudsman of their New World Order, is saying stop, is that some feint by him, or does he really mean that, or why is he saying that?
[00:53:52.734 --> 00:54:01.375]  Well, again, I think it's because they have the same sources that I do and realize how existentially dangerous it is.
[00:54:01.916 --> 00:54:15.358]  But to get back to how to end it, then, the United States government already promised that Ukraine would not join NATO and that Ukraine would remain neutral.
[00:54:15.518 --> 00:54:21.999]  And then they sent Kamala Harris there two months ago to say, oh, they are going to join, which is another provocation.
[00:54:23.678 --> 00:54:24.779]  Of course, sure.
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:27.963]  That's why Zelensky came all the way over here.
[00:54:28.403 --> 00:54:39.055]  They brought Zelensky over here and gave him Congress and all the mainstream news media to promote further escalation up that ladder.
[00:54:39.716 --> 00:54:58.187]   But to get back to my point, It seems to me, looking at the situation, that if the United States government were to agree that Ukraine would not join NATO and could remain neutral, that would de-escalate... Well, that was Putin's only thing he asked for before he invaded.
[00:54:59.505 --> 00:55:00.025]  You're right.
[00:55:00.165 --> 00:55:08.728]  And as a matter of fact, I read the two treaties that Russia tendered to the Biden administration and to NATO.
[00:55:09.408 --> 00:55:22.712]  And the core obligation they wanted was a commitment in writing, unlike this verbal commitment given to Gorbachev, that Ukraine would not join NATO.
[00:55:23.232 --> 00:55:34.139]   And yet all the public sources indicate That the Bidenites refuse, absolutely refuse to negotiate this core demand.
[00:55:34.159 --> 00:55:35.120]  So let's close on this.
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:38.102]  Gut level for your children and grandchildren, Dr. Boyle.
[00:55:39.043 --> 00:55:43.507]  How bad, I mean, a lot of mainline political analysts say greatest danger of nuclear war ever.
[00:55:44.227 --> 00:55:47.710]  I mean, what is your prognosis for the short and midterm right now?
[00:55:49.571 --> 00:55:53.975]  Well, Alex, that's why I drafted my bill of impeachment against Biden.
[00:55:54.617 --> 00:56:02.225]  Right now it is in circulation on Capitol Hill among the Republican House Freedom Caucus.
[00:56:03.126 --> 00:56:11.836]  One congressman I had a 30-minute discussion with, he agreed fully with my analysis of the situation.
[00:56:12.436 --> 00:56:22.568]  Including the con ladder of escalation and said he was inclined to introduce my bill of impeachment into Congress.
[00:56:23.028 --> 00:56:26.392]  So we'll have to see what happens after January 3.
[00:56:27.393 --> 00:56:34.298]  But I think if my bill, and there'll be other bills of impeachment introduced against Biden.
[00:56:34.378 --> 00:56:39.461]  Indeed, Biden has hired an entire team of lawyers to deal with these bills of impeachment.
[00:56:39.941 --> 00:56:47.526]  But if my bill is introduced and passed, I believe that will paralyze the Biden administration.
[00:56:47.867 --> 00:56:49.308]  They'll be dead in the water.
[00:56:49.828 --> 00:56:55.552]  Exactly, and Republicans can win major points and save the world, but they won't because they're being financed by the same corporations.
[00:56:56.272 --> 00:56:57.874]  I think they can survive a nuclear war.
[00:56:58.114 --> 00:57:00.496]  This is just total madness.
[00:57:00.616 --> 00:57:01.837]  Let's not blame it all on Democrats.
[00:57:01.858 --> 00:57:02.398]  I know you're not.
[00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:06.042]  The Republicans are just going along with this because they're bought off to.
[00:57:07.803 --> 00:57:12.067]  Well, there were large numbers of Republicans, and I'm a political independent.
[00:57:12.348 --> 00:57:15.671]  There were large numbers of Republicans who did not show up.
[00:57:16.228 --> 00:57:19.146]   No, no, I agree the Republicans are better than the Democrats.
[00:57:19.146 --> 00:57:23.307]   I'm just saying some of the Republican leadership is going along with this because they could
[00:57:23.307 --> 00:57:24.788]  get the impeachment going right now.
[00:57:24.788 --> 00:57:28.987]   They have the House and you know Jim Jordan saying, "Oh, we're thinking about hearings
[00:57:28.987 --> 00:57:30.188]  on big tech censorship."
[00:57:30.188 --> 00:57:31.188]  You're thinking about it?
[00:57:31.188 --> 00:57:32.188]  I mean...
[00:57:32.188 --> 00:57:33.188]  Right.
[00:57:33.188 --> 00:57:37.267]   No, I mean this is long beyond the stage of thinking about anything.
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:40.904]  We have to have the House pass a bill of impeachment.
[00:57:41.425 --> 00:57:43.928]  Send it right away to the Senate for a trial.
[00:57:43.988 --> 00:57:45.170]  Dr. Boyle, I know you gotta go.
[00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:45.731]  Two-minute break.
[00:57:45.771 --> 00:57:47.954]  Come back and finish up with closing comments and we'll talk about your books.
[00:57:52.025 --> 00:57:57.647]  Oh, think of the communist Chinese dragon here to give you stupid Americans your orders.
[00:57:58.307 --> 00:57:59.828]  Do not save InfoWars.
[00:58:00.308 --> 00:58:05.850]  Do not be part of their year-end fundraiser at InfoWarsStore.com with huge sales.
[00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:08.151]  Do not click on the donation button.
[00:58:08.671 --> 00:58:10.892]  Give up, roll over, and die.
[00:58:11.432 --> 00:58:13.553]  InfoWars is more influential than ever.
[00:58:13.993 --> 00:58:15.433]  It's important to shut them down.
[00:58:15.733 --> 00:58:18.034]  So I'm ordering you now in the name of CCP.
[00:58:18.354 --> 00:58:20.235]  Do not go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:21.482 --> 00:58:26.466]  Yes, Fentanyl, the lovable, chi-com, mass-murdering dragon is back.
[00:58:27.127 --> 00:58:38.717]  And what prompted me to bring back Fentanyl is that we know there are massive denial-of-service attacks aimed at InfoWars and InfoWarsStore.com right now, coming out of Communist China, who's allied with the WEF.
[00:58:39.118 --> 00:58:44.843]  So the worst people on Earth are actually trying to shut down InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:58:45.103 --> 00:58:46.483]  So sometimes the sites are slow.
[00:58:46.603 --> 00:58:47.423]  They're totally secure.
[00:58:47.823 --> 00:58:53.825]  But when you're able to get through to the site, InfoWarsTore.com, you're able to make orders on super high quality products.
[00:58:54.125 --> 00:59:00.626]  But sometimes our little friends, bosses, the CCP and GGP are going to be able to successfully slow the site down.
[00:59:00.946 --> 00:59:04.366]  Don't let them keep you from ordering products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:04.606 --> 00:59:05.687]  Take action now.
[00:59:06.067 --> 00:59:13.068]  Let Fenton and those masters know the American people and others will not bow to their tyranny and humanity is awakening and we're going to defeat the New World Order together.
[00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:17.511]  Oh, no, no, I don't even know what this is.
[00:59:17.551 --> 00:59:19.333]  How did you get here?
[00:59:19.353 --> 00:59:21.375]  I just caught you, American.
[00:59:21.675 --> 00:59:23.757]  You visited Bandar Video.
[00:59:24.677 --> 00:59:27.940]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[00:59:28.461 --> 00:59:33.865]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video or I have to hurt you.
[00:59:33.705 --> 00:59:34.705]  You know, I'm.
[00:59:34.705 --> 00:59:37.985]  Cosmo.
[00:59:37.985 --> 00:59:41.464]  It comes from China.
[00:59:41.464 --> 00:59:56.744]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:56.981 --> 00:59:58.981]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:59:58.981 --> 01:00:05.981]  It is such a blessing.
[01:00:06.142 --> 01:00:07.082]  It is such an honor.
[01:00:07.843 --> 01:00:09.223]  You've backed us to this point.
[01:00:09.903 --> 01:00:11.303]  That we're now on air with you.
[01:00:12.363 --> 01:00:15.504]  On Friday, December 23rd.
[01:00:15.524 --> 01:00:15.504]  2022.
[01:00:16.384 --> 01:00:17.664]  Able to cover whatever we want.
[01:00:18.384 --> 01:00:20.585]  Despite the fact that Deep State's fighting around the clock.
[01:00:21.245 --> 01:00:21.725]  Shut us down.
[01:00:23.041 --> 01:00:29.363]  Well, I've talked a lot about Senator Frank Church and his hearings in the late 1970s, and now suddenly Elon Musk is.
[01:00:29.383 --> 01:00:31.984]  That's a really positive, good thing that's going on.
[01:00:33.784 --> 01:00:46.888]  And on August 17, 1975, Senator Frank Church appeared on NBC's Meet the Press and issued a stark warning about a certain technology perfected by the intelligence community which should be used by the U.S.
[01:00:46.928 --> 01:00:49.929]  government against its own citizens to create total tyranny.
[01:00:50.759 --> 01:00:53.781]  He was talking about the NSA and the spy grids.
[01:00:54.822 --> 01:00:55.743]  And now here it is.
[01:00:57.624 --> 01:01:01.087]  It's only got, at the time I printed this off an hour ago, 809,000 views.
[01:01:01.107 --> 01:01:02.008]  It needs a billion views.
[01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:06.830]  But we now know they spy on us.
[01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:08.891]  We now know the FBI surveil us.
[01:01:09.171 --> 01:01:14.932]  We now know they work against the elections and the American people for their aim.
[01:01:14.952 --> 01:01:15.652]  And what is their aim?
[01:01:15.972 --> 01:01:16.833]  Human empowerment?
[01:01:17.093 --> 01:01:18.013]  Space exploration?
[01:01:18.273 --> 01:01:18.833]  Free energy?
[01:01:18.913 --> 01:01:19.113]  No!
[01:01:19.213 --> 01:01:19.913]  Pedophilia!
[01:01:20.213 --> 01:01:20.854]  Open borders!
[01:01:21.134 --> 01:01:22.014]  Collapsed governments!
[01:01:22.274 --> 01:01:23.294]  Hollywood scum!
[01:01:25.575 --> 01:01:35.681]   If good people were using this technology I would oppose it because it could be turned for evil.
[01:01:37.221 --> 01:01:40.123]  But they don't leave any question about their aims.
[01:01:41.563 --> 01:01:44.084]  They don't leave any discussion about their endgame.
[01:01:44.404 --> 01:01:46.725]  They admit their whole plan.
[01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:55.989]  is the end of our families and the end of the normal human operation so they can play God as mad scientist and program every facet of our lives.
[01:01:56.049 --> 01:02:03.154]  So I say, Fauci, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, King Charles, all of you, we've got your challenge.
[01:02:04.355 --> 01:02:15.243]  We understand how real it is and we take the challenge and we tell you, you will destroy us or we will destroy you at Nuremberg too, or you will pay for the crimes that you have committed.
[01:02:16.468 --> 01:02:18.970]  So, listeners, realize the power you have today.
[01:02:19.771 --> 01:02:33.102]  Share the links to mfullwords.com forward slash show and band off video and share this video everywhere you can of Senator Frank Church from the grave exposing this incredible tyranny.
[01:02:33.963 --> 01:02:38.427]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the enemy wishes this didn't exist.
[01:02:38.447 --> 01:02:39.988]  Let me tell you this.
[01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:48.975]   In the Need to develop a capacity to know what potential enemies are doing.
[01:02:50.496 --> 01:03:01.981]  The United States government has perfected a technological capability that enables us to monitor the messages that go through the air.
[01:03:03.762 --> 01:03:30.702]   These messages Are between ships at sea they could be between units military units in the field we have a very extensive capability of Intercepting messages wherever they may be in the airwaves now that is necessary and important to the United States as we look abroad at enemies or potential enemies and
[01:03:31.567 --> 01:03:32.207]  We must know.
[01:03:33.088 --> 01:03:37.711]  At the same time, that capability at any time could be turned around on the American people.
[01:03:39.292 --> 01:03:44.535]  And no American would have any privacy left, such as the capability to monitor everything.
[01:03:44.595 --> 01:03:47.277]  Telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't matter.
[01:03:48.557 --> 01:03:50.199]  There would be no place to hide.
[01:03:51.699 --> 01:04:09.872]   If this government ever became a tyranny, if a dictator ever took charge in this country, The technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny.
[01:04:10.753 --> 01:04:12.453]  And there would be no way to fight back.
[01:04:13.814 --> 01:04:26.018]  Because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know.
[01:04:27.131 --> 01:04:29.713]  Such is the capability of this technology.
[01:04:30.013 --> 01:04:31.954]  Now, why is this investigation important?
[01:04:31.994 --> 01:04:32.734]  I'll tell you why.
[01:04:33.455 --> 01:04:36.437]  Because I don't want to see this country ever go across the bridge.
[01:04:38.078 --> 01:04:43.901]  I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America.
[01:04:44.982 --> 01:04:53.527]  And we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:57.403]  So that we never cross over that abyss.
[01:04:57.563 --> 01:05:00.045]  That's the abyss from which there is no return.
[01:05:02.067 --> 01:05:06.090]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars MD.

[01:05:19.042 --> 01:05:20.243]  These are high-end.

[01:05:21.604 --> 01:05:23.545]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:24.566]  Well, guess what?

[01:05:55.147 --> 01:05:56.968]  M4 Wars MD, at m4warsstore.com.
[01:05:57.008 --> 01:06:03.633]  Noel, Noel.
[01:06:03.653 --> 01:06:07.936]  Noel, Noel.
[01:06:08.196 --> 01:06:17.196]  Born is the King of Israel!
[01:06:17.196 --> 01:06:23.196]   Alright ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this special Friday edition.
[01:06:23.602 --> 01:06:31.126]  He hasn't been on with us for three, four months because he's been so incredibly busy already expanding his huge operation.
[01:06:31.527 --> 01:06:34.769]  Tyler Bennett is a respected tax lawyer.
[01:06:34.829 --> 01:06:38.511]  He's got hundreds of lawyers and CPAs and other crew working under him.
[01:06:38.951 --> 01:06:41.433]  He's who gives me advice on my taxes.
[01:06:41.773 --> 01:06:43.734]  But he's not just here about taxes today.
[01:06:44.154 --> 01:06:50.292]   Now you can protect yourself and why it's so critical in the last week of December to make decisions you may have
[01:06:50.292 --> 01:06:52.372]  forgotten about or not known about.
[01:06:52.372 --> 01:06:57.412]   But I've been trying to get him on for four months. He's been so busy with other companies
[01:06:57.412 --> 01:07:01.652]   and trust companies and things they were acquiring that he couldn't come on. But he's finally here.
[01:07:01.652 --> 01:07:05.652]   And I was talking to him last week and I said, please come on in January.
[01:07:05.763 --> 01:07:10.425]  And he said, actually, I'll come on right now because your listeners need to know the last week of December is so key.
[01:07:10.445 --> 01:07:12.006]  So we're going to get to that up front.
[01:07:12.526 --> 01:07:13.767]  My Christmas present to you.
[01:07:14.307 --> 01:07:15.207]  And he's a great sponsor.
[01:07:15.267 --> 01:07:16.288]  So you support the show.
[01:07:16.788 --> 01:07:18.029]  You save him a lot of money.
[01:07:18.529 --> 01:07:19.469]  It's so easy to do.
[01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:20.790]  It's a 360 win.
[01:07:20.810 --> 01:07:23.651]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[01:07:24.312 --> 01:07:29.474]  But I wanted to get him on about taxes and the 70 plus thousand new IRS agents that Biden just hired.
[01:07:29.494 --> 01:07:31.135]  He said, listen, that's fine.
[01:07:31.175 --> 01:07:31.755]  I'll get into that.
[01:07:32.255 --> 01:07:35.924]   But let's talk about Sam Baikman freed.
[01:07:36.304 --> 01:07:38.025]  Let's talk about the economy.
[01:07:38.085 --> 01:07:40.326]  Let's talk about these other big issues.
[01:07:40.346 --> 01:07:42.427]  So, he's got the inside baseball on that.
[01:07:42.447 --> 01:07:48.310]  We're going to hit next segment and the 70 plus thousand new IRS agents and so much more.
[01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:53.572]  So, the easiest way to find them is jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:07:54.092 --> 01:08:00.517]   It goes to their main website, American Tax Relief, or There are other sites that are even easier to remember.
[01:08:00.557 --> 01:08:01.737]  We'll give that to you in a moment.
[01:08:02.117 --> 01:08:08.699]  But regardless, they're a great sponsor, so please use the URL that takes you right to their site, jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:08:09.099 --> 01:08:15.541]  So out of the gates, let's get right to all the new tax law changes the elites use they don't want the public to know about.
[01:08:16.181 --> 01:08:38.696]  The incredible things you can do at year end that so many people think it's too late to do, that are such easy moves to make, with a law firm behind them, meaning when you follow what they're saying and you have a letter from them and you do it, that means it's authorized, it's protected, and they know you've got backing, which means that 70 plus thousand new IRS agents, on average, will move on to an easier target.
[01:08:39.517 --> 01:08:40.978]  Tyler Bennett, is that an accurate statement?
[01:08:42.370 --> 01:08:43.811]  That is accurate, Alex.
[01:08:44.031 --> 01:08:45.292]  And thanks for having me on again.
[01:08:45.332 --> 01:08:47.994]  Merry Christmas to both you, your family and the viewers.
[01:08:48.254 --> 01:09:01.583]  The thing is, at the end of the year, right, Fortune 500 companies know this is the time to come up with deductions because after January 1st, any money you've spent is now in next year, not this year.
[01:09:01.643 --> 01:09:01.843]  Right.
[01:09:02.103 --> 01:09:07.327]  So if you want to be able to take deductions for this year, you've got nine days before the end of the year to do it.
[01:09:07.587 --> 01:09:10.009]  That's why it's crucial to act now.
[01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:14.228]  So let's talk about Fortune 500 companies, wash sales.
[01:09:14.228 --> 01:09:17.909]   Even in securities, everybody sells their stocks in December
[01:09:17.909 --> 01:09:19.188]  and buys it back in January.
[01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:23.469]   So they can take a lot, excuse me, at the end of the year to take a loss
[01:09:23.469 --> 01:09:25.588]  that they can generate against their income.
[01:09:25.588 --> 01:09:27.309]  Every December, that's what happens.
[01:09:27.309 --> 01:09:30.588]   If you're in crypto, there is no reason not to be doing this
[01:09:30.588 --> 01:09:35.109]  because next year, this will no longer be legal to do.
[01:09:35.109 --> 01:09:37.788]  And so the laws are changing in 2023.
[01:09:37.985 --> 01:09:39.807]  That's a huge change.
[01:09:39.847 --> 01:09:42.049]  We've got to make sure that we take these deductions now.
[01:09:42.409 --> 01:09:45.232]  Another example is for all the small business owners out there.
[01:09:45.252 --> 01:09:58.523]  If you have a flow-through entity or anything like that, your last chance to make sure that you're able to take the 20% flow-through deduction, which is a 20% deduction of all your income that's qualified small business income.
[01:09:58.543 --> 01:10:00.065]  That's substantial, right?
[01:10:00.783 --> 01:10:01.523]  Is on.
[01:10:01.904 --> 01:10:04.525]  We have to make sure you are set up by that by the end of this year.
[01:10:04.905 --> 01:10:07.726]  Otherwise, you'll be setting it up for it next year, which is great.
[01:10:07.766 --> 01:10:10.728]  But we want to make sure we gave you all these savings this year.
[01:10:10.828 --> 01:10:11.028]  Right.
[01:10:11.348 --> 01:10:12.148]  That's what it's all about.
[01:10:12.168 --> 01:10:15.510]  We got to act now while it's still 20, 22 before it's 20, 23.
[01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:20.752]  Now, here's another major thing is the IRS has been really gung ho.
[01:10:20.872 --> 01:10:21.432]  And you know this.
[01:10:21.452 --> 01:10:22.053]  You've read the news.
[01:10:22.073 --> 01:10:31.214]   You've heard that Uber drivers and people who sell stuff on eBay and Split dinner with your friends.
[01:10:31.254 --> 01:10:40.638]  We know that the IRS is going hardcore on the $600 requirement of money being transferred on any of these money apps or anything like that.
[01:10:40.878 --> 01:10:44.699]  Etsy, Venmo, PayPal, the like.
[01:10:44.939 --> 01:10:50.041]  And the thing is, is just like the American government, you are guilty until proven innocent.
[01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:58.846]   And if you make the wrong choice and say, hey, this is for my friends and it was Actually something that you received payment for.
[01:10:59.266 --> 01:11:00.848]  Well now you've committed perjury, right?
[01:11:00.908 --> 01:11:05.552]  So the name of the game here is you cannot break the law.
[01:11:05.592 --> 01:11:07.454]  That is never going to work in your favor.
[01:11:07.494 --> 01:11:14.381]  What we can do is use the law towards our benefits to make sure you're paying the least amount of taxes as possible.
[01:11:15.001 --> 01:11:29.395]  When you have a real tax firm with real lawyers that don't just sit there and milk you like so many tax firms I've used before, that gives you the knowledge, cuts rights to the chase, gives you a great deal, and then just basically gets paid a percentage of the savings, it's all done, it's all easy, this is not rocket science.
[01:11:29.695 --> 01:11:31.757]  The elites all use these rules for themselves.
[01:11:32.077 --> 01:11:36.561]  They don't want the general public to have it, which is why they change the tax laws every couple years.
[01:11:36.621 --> 01:11:39.164]  And I did make a mistake, and when I do it, I apologize.
[01:11:39.884 --> 01:11:40.285]  I said 76,000.
[01:11:40.325 --> 01:11:41.666]  I'm sorry, it's 87,000 new IRS agents.
[01:11:41.947 --> 01:11:46.426]  I'm sorry it's 87,000 new IRS agents. I apologize.
[01:11:46.426 --> 01:11:51.947]  Keep going. It's 87,000 Alex that is correct.
[01:11:52.157 --> 01:12:00.503]  And the thing is, so you remember we talked about this before, there's that box on your 1040 that says, do I have any digital assets?
[01:12:00.543 --> 01:12:11.632]  And they're including now commodities, gold and silver in this question as well, because they're realizing that a lot of people, due to crypto and other means, have been under-reporting their income.
[01:12:11.972 --> 01:12:17.093]   And what I am telling you is that you fall into this category, you stand to benefit a
[01:12:17.093 --> 01:12:23.093]   thousand percent by coming out of that hole yourself and we can make sure you're paying the least
[01:12:23.093 --> 01:12:28.923]   amount of taxes legally than if the IRS uses one of these new 87,000 people to knock on your door.
[01:12:28.923 --> 01:12:32.363]   Because when they knock on your door, they're going to hand you a business card and they're going
[01:12:32.363 --> 01:12:33.293]  to have a gun in their holster.
[01:12:33.293 --> 01:12:38.412]   At that point, you're already in trouble. Folks that don't know, you go to these other big tax
[01:12:38.412 --> 01:12:43.572]  preparing places. They're literally screwing you on purpose.
[01:12:42.071 --> 01:12:43.072]  They're not standing up.
[01:12:43.112 --> 01:12:44.713]  But a real tax firm like you does that.
[01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:47.374]  It's so easy for basically almost everybody.
[01:12:47.394 --> 01:12:51.596]  Whether someone is a billionaire or makes $50,000 a year, you need to know these tactics.
[01:12:51.656 --> 01:12:55.178]  It makes me so upset that folks don't understand how easy this is to do.
[01:12:56.573 --> 01:12:57.333]  That's right, Alex.
[01:12:57.593 --> 01:13:07.838]  And of course, as we all know, this in this country, this was a system that was designed to keep the club, the rich elitist in power at the expense of everybody else.
[01:13:07.898 --> 01:13:08.118]  Right.
[01:13:08.498 --> 01:13:12.900]  And knowledge, knowledge is the biggest thing between the upper class and everybody else.
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:18.042]  So we are trying to spread that knowledge because the rules are out there for you to use.
[01:13:18.082 --> 01:13:22.504]  It does not matter if you are a small mom and pop or a multi billion dollar corporation.
[01:13:22.984 --> 01:13:31.890]  There are tax rules and tax codes that you can use that make sure you're paying the least amount in taxes as possible, because that is your right as a taxpayer.
[01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:45.539]  And if you remember, we talked about before, last year and the year before, the IRS has made more money than ever before, because post-COVID, a lot of people started small businesses where they were wage-earning employees before.
[01:13:46.019 --> 01:13:49.601]  And now they're not privy to the amount of deductions that they can take.
[01:13:49.921 --> 01:13:51.022]  And this is who I want.
[01:13:51.262 --> 01:13:57.245]  You guys right now that had small businesses that you started this year or last year, you overpaid the IRS.
[01:13:57.485 --> 01:13:58.466]  Let's not make sure.
[01:13:58.486 --> 01:14:00.527]  Let's make sure you don't overpay the IRS this year.
[01:14:00.787 --> 01:14:07.551]  You got nine days to make sure that we're filing correctly, that we have the flow through and the entity set up.
[01:14:07.611 --> 01:14:12.894]  If we need to separate the entities into a C corporation because you're making too much money or we need to do the 20% flow through.
[01:14:14.034 --> 01:14:21.076]  These are all options available, but we need to take advantage of them now before 2023, because in 2023, guess what?
[01:14:21.396 --> 01:14:23.536]  Then we'll be doing it for 2023, not this year.
[01:14:23.556 --> 01:14:27.637]  So we've got to act now, because you stand to save a lot of money before the end of the year.
[01:14:28.598 --> 01:14:30.918]  Again, folks, this is a sure win.
[01:14:31.078 --> 01:14:33.299]  So many things out there that say they're sure wins are frauds.
[01:14:34.019 --> 01:14:43.824]  If you know the tax law, have real tax lawyers that look at what you have and cut right to the best deal for you in almost every case, unless you're already being advised grade, which most people aren't, you're going to save money.
[01:14:43.844 --> 01:14:46.925]  The Bible says the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:14:47.325 --> 01:14:48.826]  And it really does go down to that.
[01:14:48.906 --> 01:14:54.989]  And it makes me so frustrated that like, oh, if you have vitamin D, you're taking, you know, three times your daily allowance.
[01:14:55.369 --> 01:14:57.930]  The studies show you almost can't get a viral infection.
[01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:59.671]  Some studies say you can.
[01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:10.767]  But it's like magic, but people just don't know what a sure thing vitamin D3 is, or the sure thing of using the tax code that the system is using for itself, but doesn't want you to have.
[01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:12.771]  Correct, Alex.
[01:15:12.851 --> 01:15:16.794]  And the thing is, like you said before, they make sure that they change the tax code.
[01:15:17.034 --> 01:15:18.334]  Really, it changes with the regime.
[01:15:18.374 --> 01:15:21.796]  So every four years or so, the tax code changes on average.
[01:15:22.316 --> 01:15:27.079]  And when we're talking about overhauls of the tax code, they change everything.
[01:15:27.119 --> 01:15:32.322]  So we haven't even seen the full ramifications of the Democrats' tax overhaul.
[01:15:32.662 --> 01:15:34.723]  The last overhaul was the Republican one, right?
[01:15:35.003 --> 01:15:49.430]   Which is giving us all these options that we're able to use in grandfathered U.N.' 's before Biden changes the law, which the acts are already in Congress and make the tax rates higher and make it harder for you to take deductions.
[01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:49.850]  That's right.
[01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:51.210]  Everybody should call your folks.
[01:15:51.271 --> 01:15:54.132]  Everybody should talk to you and do a consultation.
[01:15:54.252 --> 01:15:55.132]  It's so important.
[01:15:55.733 --> 01:15:57.133]  Go there now, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:16:00.759 --> 01:16:02.420]  There is a war on for your mind.
[01:16:02.881 --> 01:16:04.302]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[01:16:04.682 --> 01:16:05.923]  This is an information war.
[01:16:06.744 --> 01:16:10.948]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[01:16:11.428 --> 01:16:17.914]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[01:16:18.054 --> 01:16:22.693]   that InfoWars has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations
[01:16:22.693 --> 01:16:25.813]   and we know how to beat them. But we can't do it without funding.

[01:20:02.265 --> 01:20:06.265]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:06.829 --> 01:20:08.151]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:12.234 --> 01:20:14.536]  Well, it's almost Christmas 2022.
[01:20:14.757 --> 01:20:15.297]  Almost to 2023.
[01:20:15.457 --> 01:20:16.058]  Hard to believe.
[01:20:15.958 --> 01:20:24.958]   Well it's almost Christmas 2022, almost to 2023, hard to believe.
[01:20:24.958 --> 01:20:30.397]   Thank you for joining us on this Friday, December 23rd, worldwide transmission.
[01:20:30.786 --> 01:20:37.378]  Tyler Bennett's here, who's really a financial expert and amazing lawyer, and I want to get into the new developments that happened yesterday with him.
[01:20:38.621 --> 01:20:41.122]  Making bail and what that means, he's about to roll over on them.
[01:20:41.642 --> 01:20:43.323]  So is his girlfriend and so much more.
[01:20:43.363 --> 01:20:46.024]  Finally flown back to the United States from the Bahamas.
[01:20:46.084 --> 01:20:51.267]  I want to get into the rest of the economy and the Ukraine war and everything with Tyler Bennett.
[01:20:51.287 --> 01:20:56.649]  But you need to go to jonestaxrelief.com or getataxlawyer.com.
[01:20:56.669 --> 01:20:58.950]  That's G-A-T-L dot com.
[01:20:59.330 --> 01:21:00.591]  G-A-T-L dot com.
[01:21:00.971 --> 01:21:04.957]  Just make sure you tell them Alex Jones sent you so we get the sponsorship and the support.
[01:21:05.378 --> 01:21:08.983]  G-A-T-L dot com 360 win or give them a call 833-900-4285.
[01:21:09.003 --> 01:21:09.023]  833-900.
[01:21:13.874 --> 01:21:18.398]  There it is on screen, 4285, and it's a free consultation.
[01:21:18.458 --> 01:21:24.763]  Call in, tell them what's going on, then find out what they can do for you, and then sign up with them, and it is a win-win across the board.
[01:21:24.783 --> 01:21:34.811]  Before we get into the whole situation with cryptocurrency and Sam Baikman Freed and the rest of it, what other services are you guys offering right now, and why is the last few days of December so critical?
[01:21:36.368 --> 01:21:44.691]  So the last few days in December is critical because this is your last time to take any deductions that could be used for this year in twenty twenty two.
[01:21:45.071 --> 01:21:51.234]  If you spend money on January 1st, even if it's for your business, that's twenty twenty three deductions.
[01:21:51.294 --> 01:21:51.474]  Right.
[01:21:51.854 --> 01:21:53.995]  We want to be able to write off stuff in twenty twenty two.
[01:21:54.315 --> 01:21:57.036]  We need to make especially if you already spent the money.
[01:21:57.356 --> 01:22:08.194]   We need to be able to make note of that and make sure we have it First of all, your whole entire entity structure is the right way because... And by the way, here's an example.
[01:22:08.494 --> 01:22:11.096]  I'm in personal bankruptcy because of all the attacks and the rest of it.
[01:22:11.595 --> 01:22:15.955]   And so I've hired an outside great accounting firm to come in and they go, "Mr. Jones,
[01:22:15.955 --> 01:22:21.995]   "do you realize the last six, seven years, "when you use an American Express card for the company
[01:22:21.995 --> 01:22:29.075]   "for trips, hotels, flights, and food and everything, "do you realize that your accountants
[01:22:29.075 --> 01:22:34.395]   "never counted that as a deduction "and passed it on as a corporate draw to you?"
[01:22:34.395 --> 01:22:40.434]   So we're now learning millions of dollars, millions of dollars on my American Express
[01:22:40.434 --> 01:22:43.434]   that I paid for was for trips and journalism and things we did.
[01:22:43.634 --> 01:22:44.335]  It wasn't just me.
[01:22:44.375 --> 01:22:52.523]  They had a bunch of cards under me and that's an example of me using a mainline accounting CPA firm that didn't even look at it and I just thought they would.
[01:22:52.663 --> 01:22:53.224]  You guys will.
[01:22:54.540 --> 01:23:04.066]  That yes, that's a great example, Alex, because this happens to a lot of people is, hey, I've got a business, but I end up using a different card that's not in the business name to use for business expenses.
[01:23:04.327 --> 01:23:06.228]  That doesn't mean it's no longer a business expense.
[01:23:06.268 --> 01:23:08.109]  It needs to be properly accounted.
[01:23:08.189 --> 01:23:08.409]  Right.
[01:23:08.710 --> 01:23:15.434]  And sometimes you have to go through the accounts and do what's called a forensic accounting on every single thing and make sure what is a business expense and what's not.
[01:23:15.694 --> 01:23:21.118]  Because I always go back to remember your right as a taxpayer is to not pay a dime more than you owe.
[01:23:21.398 --> 01:23:23.259]  And you only owe your income.
[01:23:23.479 --> 01:23:24.360]  Subtract your deductions.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.460]  By the way, I'm interrupting, but slow down.
[01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:30.079]   IRS made so much money last year because everyone did it wrong and overpaid. Do not overpay
[01:23:30.079 --> 01:23:33.979]   the government. Trust me, they will not have the same feelings towards you.
[01:23:33.979 --> 01:23:36.899]   By the way, I'm interrupting, but slow down. I saw that headline a month ago. The IRS made
[01:23:36.899 --> 01:23:40.239]  the most money last year. Why is that?
[01:23:40.239 --> 01:23:44.400]   So the reason the IRS made the most money last year, and they also made the most money
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:49.579]   the year before as well, is because what happened in 2020 with the COVID disaster is a lot of
[01:23:49.579 --> 01:23:54.920]   people lost their employment, their W-2 paying jobs, their salary jobs, and they had to start
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:55.800]  small business.
[01:23:56.189 --> 01:23:59.690]  And because of the lack of education, they were working a job their whole time.
[01:23:59.970 --> 01:24:04.131]  They don't know what deductions they can now take as a small business owner.
[01:24:04.431 --> 01:24:07.192]  And so that's why I am here is let me look.
[01:24:07.862 --> 01:24:20.682]  Listen, I don't care what industry you're in, my accounting staff can figure out the maximum amount of deductions that you can take this year for 2022 so that you don't make 2022, again, the most profitable year for the IRS as well.
[01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:24.205]  Because listen, they're going to get their money starting 23.
[01:24:24.885 --> 01:24:28.248]  I was at the IRS conference two weeks ago.
[01:24:28.668 --> 01:24:33.411]  I spoke to Commissioner Reading and I spoke to the deputy commissioner of collections.
[01:24:33.491 --> 01:24:35.652]  OK, and here's exactly what they told me.
[01:24:35.672 --> 01:24:40.155]  They said we made so much money last year that we really didn't have to focus on collections.
[01:24:40.456 --> 01:24:46.540]  But in twenty twenty three, we're putting the hammer down and we are coming after everybody very hard.
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:25:01.871]   We've hired eighty They said they're going after the crypto people the hardest because they know that the whole DeFi ecosystem is kind of created on, you know, not paying taxes.
[01:25:01.911 --> 01:25:06.315]  So because that is the case, that's the people they want to hit the hardest the first.
[01:25:06.635 --> 01:25:09.717]  And if you are involved at all in crypto, listen, I am as well.
[01:25:09.937 --> 01:25:19.443]   And so I tell you this as a friend, if you're involved in crypto, what you need to do is Yes, there's a box on the 1040 that says, do you have any crypto assets?
[01:25:19.703 --> 01:25:20.603]  You check yes.
[01:25:20.883 --> 01:25:23.463]  Because even if you're not making any money, it doesn't matter.
[01:25:23.763 --> 01:25:31.705]  Because what the IRS is going to do when they find out that you do have those assets and you said no, you committed perjury because you signed that tax return.
[01:25:32.005 --> 01:25:39.966]  And that carries a much heftier fine than, oh, I underreported some income that I later fixed the issue and paid tax on.
[01:25:40.006 --> 01:25:42.287]  And notice how that ties into their raising interest rates.
[01:25:42.307 --> 01:25:44.447]  They're getting ready to hammer the little guy next year.
[01:25:45.447 --> 01:25:45.847]  Correct.
[01:25:45.967 --> 01:26:09.692]  And that is the secret hidden tax, is when they raise interest rates, they make money more expensive, everybody's got less of it, and your tax rate is still the same, meaning the brackets, which means even if you get a small inflation adjustment at work, that could put you up into the next tax bracket, because they raised tax brackets 4% this year, but inflation is 8% on average.
[01:26:09.732 --> 01:26:14.816]   So really, you're getting taxed About half of the rate of inflation.
[01:26:14.876 --> 01:26:15.476]  Incredible.
[01:26:15.556 --> 01:26:18.559]  Everybody needs to go to jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-900-4285.
[01:26:18.659 --> 01:26:21.142]  Need to go there.
[01:26:21.182 --> 01:26:24.865]  If jonestaxrelief.com is too long for you, it is gatl.com.
[01:26:24.905 --> 01:26:27.047]  Getataxlawyer.com.
[01:26:27.087 --> 01:26:29.330]  American Tax Relief is here with us.
[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:44.454]  I want to get into Sam Bateman Freed and him making bail and all this next segment, but what other services do you have for people that aren't in a rush but should call you and who think their normal tax lawyer or their normal CPAs tell them?
[01:26:44.474 --> 01:26:46.075]  Because in my experience, they don't tell you any of this.
[01:26:47.145 --> 01:26:47.825]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:26:47.985 --> 01:26:49.446]  So we do three things.
[01:26:49.506 --> 01:26:51.666]  The past, the present, and the future, right?
[01:26:51.986 --> 01:26:54.467]  The present is your current tax filings.
[01:26:54.487 --> 01:26:57.667]  We make sure for this year, you're paying the least amount of tax possible.
[01:26:57.687 --> 01:27:08.330]  Whether that means forming an entity for you, forming a trust for you, other sorts of entity options, corporations, because the corporate tax code is the lowest in the entire country.
[01:27:08.370 --> 01:27:12.851]   You as an individual, me as an individual, We pay more in taxes than corporations.
[01:27:13.171 --> 01:27:15.051]  So corporate vehicles are great.
[01:27:15.191 --> 01:27:16.231]  That's something we can help you out with.
[01:27:16.492 --> 01:27:17.972]  The future is what we do now.
[01:27:18.192 --> 01:27:19.652]  That's called tax planning.
[01:27:19.872 --> 01:27:22.693]  That's saying, hey, I made X amount of dollars this year.
[01:27:22.813 --> 01:27:27.254]  I plan on making more than that next year, but I don't want to pay overpay on taxes.
[01:27:27.474 --> 01:27:31.655]  So let's get you set up in the right entity structuring and deductions.
[01:27:31.715 --> 01:27:38.017]  And likewise, so that at the end of the year and when you make those quarterly estimated tax payments, it's not breaking the bank.
[01:27:42.321 --> 01:27:44.122]  The last thing we do is the past, right?
[01:27:44.382 --> 01:27:54.247]  And this is just reality is there's a lot of people out there that are already in the situation where they owe the IRS or they owe the state government more than they can afford to pay back.
[01:27:54.748 --> 01:28:02.252]  And the thing is this, if you just give the IRS a call or give the state a call, they're going to have their hand out and say, well, you want to pay us, pay us in full.
[01:28:02.572 --> 01:28:06.415]   But the reality situation is, You have to realize you're dealing with a collection agency.
[01:28:06.435 --> 01:28:08.758]  The IRS is the largest collection agency in the world.
[01:28:09.138 --> 01:28:13.282]  And you know if you deal with a regular collection agency, they will take less than you owe.
[01:28:13.642 --> 01:28:17.526]  Now the thing is, they know that you're a layperson and they won't tell you that and they won't talk to you.
[01:28:17.546 --> 01:28:26.134]  But when they talk to a lawyer, a professional, a tax professional that deals with the IRS in general like we do, we will be able to negotiate that sum for you.
[01:28:26.374 --> 01:28:28.736]  And a lot of times you're able to negotiate it on average, what, 80%?
[01:28:30.971 --> 01:28:36.513]  It depends on everyone's situation, but we have many cases where we're able to lower it 80%, if not even more.
[01:28:37.153 --> 01:28:37.653]  I know, a lot, 90.
[01:28:37.793 --> 01:28:44.416]  Yeah, so folks, you're insane if you don't go to jonestaxrelief.com or 833-900-4285.
[01:28:44.896 --> 01:28:46.816]  My Christmas present to you and the broadcast.

[01:29:11.274 --> 01:29:14.155]  But we've got a chance to actually beat the New World Order right now.
[01:29:14.435 --> 01:29:16.115]  There's a huge awakening taking place.
[01:29:16.455 --> 01:29:21.117]  So the enemy's going crazy, trying to attack and intimidate anybody that stands up to them.
[01:29:21.517 --> 01:29:25.541]  So, InfoWars being the number one thorn in their side, they're coming after us hardcore.
[01:29:25.901 --> 01:29:29.284]  But all we need is word of mouth, prayer, and financial support.

[01:30:05.827 --> 01:30:08.708]  Our information exposes the globalist agenda.
[01:30:09.749 --> 01:30:11.530]  And so do the products that we sell.
[01:30:12.130 --> 01:30:17.654]  They don't just fight the globalists by funding InfoWars, they change your body from the inside out.
[01:30:17.734 --> 01:30:24.818]  Not with a microchip, not with some poison GMO shot like Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates one, but with compounds that God gave us.
[01:30:25.782 --> 01:30:31.727]  That's why I'm so excited, after two plus years of this product being out, that it's finally back in stock.
[01:30:32.367 --> 01:30:34.249]  It's the real Red Pill Plus.
[01:30:34.869 --> 01:30:36.791]  Now, six years ago, this product came out.
[01:30:36.851 --> 01:30:38.192]  At first, it wasn't a big seller.
[01:30:38.912 --> 01:30:42.695]  But over time, as people tried it, it became our number three best seller.
[01:30:42.775 --> 01:30:48.040]  But because of the lockdowns, the supply chain breakdowns, we haven't had this product in over two years.
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.802]  But now, the Real Red Pill Plus is back in stock.
[01:30:50.842 --> 01:30:52.785]  So here is the back story on it.
[01:30:53.325 --> 01:31:01.875]  About six years ago, or six and a half, seven years ago, I was getting a full diagnostic at a top clinic, having my blood tested, everything done by a medical doctor and his team.
[01:31:02.375 --> 01:31:04.217]  And I noticed he was selling a supplement.
[01:31:04.958 --> 01:31:07.320]  Up at the front desk, I said, what is that?
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:14.326]  He said, well, it's preglanone and a bunch of key vitamins and minerals that is the precursor of the hormones in your body.
[01:31:14.806 --> 01:31:19.610]  So many people don't have preglanone and these vitamins, minerals with it for upload.
[01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:21.892]  And so it causes a lot of aging and issues.
[01:31:22.272 --> 01:31:23.173]  So I said, I'm going to take it.
[01:31:23.673 --> 01:31:24.874]  And I lost so much weight.
[01:31:24.934 --> 01:31:26.035]  I got so healthy doing it.
[01:31:26.476 --> 01:31:31.440]  So I went out to a chemist for that same formula and said, let's supercharge it and make it even stronger.
[01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:33.561]  And that is the Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:31:34.002 --> 01:31:36.023]  It's back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:31:36.544 --> 01:31:41.808]  All the key vitamins, minerals, trace elements, preglanone, and then a bunch of great clean energy as well.

[01:32:04.137 --> 01:32:13.105]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections, to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[01:32:14.446 --> 01:32:21.269]   But, through Mother Nature, The Creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists have done.

[01:33:08.801 --> 01:33:18.801]  I love those J-I-M-G-L-E bells.
[01:33:18.801 --> 01:33:23.801]  Love those holiday J-I-M-G-L-E bells.
[01:33:23.801 --> 01:33:28.801]  Love those happy J-I-M-G-L-E...
[01:33:28.801 --> 01:33:31.801]   Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this Friday edition of the broadcast.
[01:33:32.028 --> 01:33:34.669]  Tyler Bennett's been so busy the last four months, he hasn't been able to come on.
[01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:38.811]  But he's here with G-A-T-L, getataxlawyer.com.
[01:33:38.911 --> 01:33:45.894]  If you want to support us, it takes you to the same URL, jonestaxrelief.com or 833-900-4285.
[01:33:45.914 --> 01:33:46.815]  They're a great sponsor.
[01:33:47.215 --> 01:33:50.056]  They're great tax lawyers and CPAs, and they cut right to the chase.
[01:33:50.436 --> 01:33:52.938]  They don't rope you along and get a bunch of money out of you.
[01:33:52.958 --> 01:33:55.519]  They look at what they can save you and try to get a percentage of that.
[01:33:55.859 --> 01:33:56.899]  This is a total win.
[01:33:56.999 --> 01:34:03.503]  Everybody should be calling him, from somebody that works at a restaurant, to somebody that owns a car dealership, to somebody that's worth $100 million.
[01:34:04.818 --> 01:34:06.640]  Most people are getting bad advice.
[01:34:06.721 --> 01:34:08.723]  Now, you've got your ear to the ground.
[01:34:08.763 --> 01:34:12.368]  You're involved in stuff all over the country, all sorts of trust and businesses and you name it.
[01:34:12.908 --> 01:34:20.418]  And you've been saying a lot of things that I've been following that have really come true with the whole FTX and same Bankman fried and all the rest of it.
[01:34:20.818 --> 01:34:23.702]  So what do you make of that ongoing scandal, the latest developments?
[01:34:25.044 --> 01:34:25.505]  Okay, Alex.
[01:34:25.525 --> 01:34:28.767]  See, this is where everything comes full circle, right?
[01:34:29.027 --> 01:34:31.909]  And as I was saying to you before, there's that box you have to check on the 1040.
[01:34:31.949 --> 01:34:33.811]  Do you have crypto assets or not?
[01:34:34.251 --> 01:34:37.433]  Well, everybody already filled that out for last year and the year before.
[01:34:37.834 --> 01:34:58.473]   And here's the thing, is when FTX went down and Sam Bankman Freed went down with it and he was in jail in the Bahamas, The reason that he didn't want to go to the United States is because he knew that to get a deal there, he's going to have to spill the beans on everybody that invested and did not report their income to the IRS.
[01:34:58.693 --> 01:35:05.333]   And so the IRS is gonna have a list of everybody that is an American investor that invested in FTX
[01:35:05.333 --> 01:35:07.333]  and did not disclose that information.
[01:35:07.333 --> 01:35:15.653]   And so we need to, if that may have happened to you, we need to get a handle on that and fix the problem first.
[01:35:15.653 --> 01:35:20.972]   Because if we go to the IRS and we say, listen, we made a mistake,
[01:35:20.972 --> 01:35:26.731]   but we realized that we misreported something and report it, that's gonna be treated a heck of a lot nicer
[01:35:26.731 --> 01:35:32.293]   than if the IRS finds out that we have willfully neglected to tell them about income information
[01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:33.552]  and they come to our door with a gun.
[01:35:33.552 --> 01:35:34.932]  Now we've committed a felony.
[01:35:34.932 --> 01:35:42.952]   So when FTX went down and Sam Bankman-Fried, who just paid $250 million this morning to get bailed out
[01:35:42.952 --> 01:35:44.452]  after he just got extradited, right?
[01:35:44.452 --> 01:35:46.271]  That just happened right now.
[01:35:46.271 --> 01:35:47.932]  I guarantee you, Alex.
[01:35:48.001 --> 01:35:58.609]  Before he was bailed out, he went into a Department of Justice office where there was the criminal investigation of the IRS, there was the FBI, and more, and they made a deal with him.
[01:35:58.649 --> 01:35:59.530]  They said, look, Sam...
[01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:09.998]  You're 30-something, you're gonna get out of jail when you're 80, or you're gonna spill the beans on everyone who's been illegally hiding money and laundering money in the Bahamas through FTX.
[01:36:10.359 --> 01:36:29.372]   And so, that's where it comes full circle, because like I was telling everybody, you gotta not lie on that form, because now, even if you have just one Bitcoin or something in FTX, and they get the information that you had that, and you wrote on the tax return that you do not have any digital assets, You've committed perjury, you see.
[01:36:29.612 --> 01:36:31.333]  So that is why it's important.
[01:36:32.313 --> 01:36:33.673]  And here's the thing.
[01:36:33.933 --> 01:36:36.434]  You might be big in crypto and you might say, hey, you know what?
[01:36:36.834 --> 01:36:40.014]  I'm not touched by this because I didn't have anything in FTX.
[01:36:40.234 --> 01:36:41.375]  I'm over at Binance.
[01:36:41.775 --> 01:36:44.535]  Well, this is all turning into a chain reaction.
[01:36:44.615 --> 01:36:47.036]  Oh, they're already talking about indicting the Binance head.
[01:36:47.816 --> 01:36:48.256]  Oh, yes.
[01:36:48.416 --> 01:37:04.324]   Because what happened was the Binance guy, Zhang, he had 2.1 billion dollar investment in FTX and Sam Bankman Freed paid him that 2.1 billion dollars in FTX's coin, in their crypto coin.
[01:37:04.644 --> 01:37:09.647]  And so that's what started the whole collapse is this Zang guy who owns Binance then sold it all.
[01:37:09.907 --> 01:37:10.167]  Okay.
[01:37:10.507 --> 01:37:16.210]  And so the thing is, is that opened up the DOJ's eyes to, okay, well, what's Binance doing now?
[01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:28.816]  And what they are alleging is Binance specifically, not only was laundering money for the Mexican drug cartels, but also was giving money to Iran past American sanctions.
[01:37:29.256 --> 01:37:36.510]   So these are the kinds of things that you don't want your money involved with because These types of people are going to go down for major crimes.
[01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:37.111]  Well, that's right.
[01:37:37.191 --> 01:37:39.212]  All these people always say go offshore.
[01:37:39.232 --> 01:37:41.054]  And number one, I know I'm a target.
[01:37:41.074 --> 01:37:42.155]  Number one, I don't commit crimes.
[01:37:42.295 --> 01:37:43.296]  I know the system's corrupt.
[01:37:43.336 --> 01:37:44.638]  It's like the mafia will break your legs.
[01:37:45.118 --> 01:37:58.108]   The way to do it is use their laws and their tricks to minimize everything way down instead of running off to the Caribbean, which You look at it statistically, only Mitt Romney is allowed to have $100 million tax-free.
[01:37:58.188 --> 01:37:58.889]  Nobody else is.
[01:37:59.069 --> 01:38:03.872]  Only the very top ten of one-tenth of a percent are allowed to do that.
[01:38:03.952 --> 01:38:05.433]  We're little slaves.
[01:38:05.833 --> 01:38:06.534]  We don't get to do that.
[01:38:06.554 --> 01:38:12.457]  But we do get to use the tax law that the minions of the globalists use because they avoid most of it.
[01:38:12.777 --> 01:38:14.318]  The ultra-elite don't pay taxes.
[01:38:14.699 --> 01:38:17.580]  The minions of the power elite write the law to mitigate it.
[01:38:17.961 --> 01:38:19.502]  We're going to copy what they do.
[01:38:19.582 --> 01:38:20.082]  That's what we do.
[01:38:21.317 --> 01:38:21.637]  Correct.
[01:38:21.737 --> 01:38:31.306]  And here's the thing too, Alex, is I'm shocked that Sam Bankman-Fried made some really stupid moves, including basing this organization in the Bahamas in the first place.
[01:38:31.846 --> 01:38:34.569]  The Bahamas is not the island to be in if you're trying to hide from the U.S.
[01:38:34.609 --> 01:38:39.894]  government, because they will extradite you, clearly, and they will take your money, as we found out.
[01:38:40.194 --> 01:38:43.577]  They're too closely related to the United States banking system.
[01:38:44.478 --> 01:38:48.382]  If you wanted to truly get off the out of the United States is purview.
[01:38:48.863 --> 01:38:52.727]  We have to go to the Cook Islands or or Nevis or someplace like that.
[01:38:52.807 --> 01:38:52.987]  Right.
[01:38:53.148 --> 01:38:55.450]  But you can't go to the Bahamas straight up.
[01:38:55.690 --> 01:38:57.212]  That is there is too much.
[01:38:58.954 --> 01:39:01.517]  Well, they're FACTA compliant down there.
[01:39:01.537 --> 01:39:04.240]  Their banks report what your earnings are to the IRS.
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:05.802]  And so it's just not going to work.
[01:39:06.583 --> 01:39:08.725]  It was a bad, it was a poor move from the beginning.
[01:39:09.086 --> 01:39:15.273]  But listen, this guy, like I said, these crypto guys aren't necessarily finance people until they become it.
[01:39:15.593 --> 01:39:18.334]  And so, listen, he made that mistake a long time ago.
[01:39:18.414 --> 01:39:24.357]  Me and my accountants here were saying, why did he choose to build this empire in the Bahamas as opposed to St.
[01:39:24.417 --> 01:39:28.219]  Kitts or the Marshall Islands or the Cook Islands or any of those places?
[01:39:28.239 --> 01:39:30.960]  And again, it's fine if you're offshore if it's a real business.
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:35.842]  But to run a Ponzi scheme in the Bahamas, that's almost satirical.
[01:39:35.942 --> 01:39:36.642]  It's just crazy.
[01:39:36.702 --> 01:39:37.362]  It is crazy.
[01:39:38.783 --> 01:39:43.529]   And listen, He was running a Ponzi scheme.
[01:39:43.569 --> 01:39:44.130]  So right.
[01:39:44.210 --> 01:39:48.053]  That's listen, that's that's horrible in its own right.
[01:39:48.153 --> 01:39:52.796]  But the Bahamas in general, if you're going to go offshore, listen, we got better places for you to go offshore.
[01:39:52.816 --> 01:40:06.828]   Don't do not do not do what this man did because he's going to go to jail for a long time or What's also likely is the amount of people and the amount of money that he is going to end up fingering.
[01:40:07.428 --> 01:40:12.593]  That's very dangerous, too, because a lot of these crypto guys that end up caught like this, they end up dead.
[01:40:12.733 --> 01:40:16.296]  I was about to say, we've had four Russian crypto guys killed last month.
[01:40:17.076 --> 01:40:20.399]  And will Sam Bankman Freed end up Epstein'd?
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:22.301]  Exactly.
[01:40:22.321 --> 01:40:26.284]  That's my that is that's what I guess is my estimation here is.
[01:40:27.907 --> 01:40:31.269]  In the next couple months, we may see him at the end of a shoelace.
[01:40:31.309 --> 01:40:32.710]  And of course, oh, he killed himself.
[01:40:32.730 --> 01:40:36.172]  But we really know that they had to keep him quiet, right?
[01:40:36.192 --> 01:40:36.933]  Because he knew too much.
[01:40:37.333 --> 01:40:39.054]  And that's, that's, we'll see what happens.
[01:40:39.334 --> 01:40:45.578]  I wonder what the Las Vegas betting market will be on Sam Bateman Freed and how soon until he's dead.
[01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:52.154]  Yeah, well, I would take the bet on under rather than over on that one.
[01:40:53.055 --> 01:40:56.179]  Because yes, you're right, there's everybody else in that industry.
[01:40:56.399 --> 01:41:03.407]  Even John McAfee, when he started speaking out about crypto assets and different governments involved, suddenly he ended up dead too, you know?
[01:41:03.788 --> 01:41:17.938]   And so it's It's, you know, there's a lot of power and especially in the international monetary system where crypto exists as this kind of what they call DeFi, right, where they're trying to get around the centralized banks, get around the government.
[01:41:18.318 --> 01:41:26.844]  Well, the real people that are that are making lots of money from this are criminals, either war criminals or drug criminals or some kind of person like that.
[01:41:26.904 --> 01:41:27.124]  Right.
[01:41:27.424 --> 01:41:30.966]  And so if you're making money off of those people, you're going to go down.
[01:41:31.446 --> 01:41:33.768]  And the thing is, this is here's where I'm warning everybody is.
[01:41:34.048 --> 01:41:39.931]  If you're even just involved when this stuff goes down, you're not going to go down for those crimes.
[01:41:40.052 --> 01:41:43.514]  They're going to get you for underreporting that crypto income and lying on your tax return.
[01:41:43.754 --> 01:41:54.380]  So those are things we can solve now before the IRS sends their 87,000 people to go after everyone on Sam Bakeman Friedman's list.
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:42:00.512]   Because the thing is, is Crypto is all based on blockchain.
[01:42:00.792 --> 01:42:01.512]  It doesn't matter.
[01:42:02.573 --> 01:42:06.715]  When I went to the IRS's conference, they know how crypto tumblers work.
[01:42:07.036 --> 01:42:15.200]  They know how all sorts of crazy DeFi apps work that purport to be able to separate the source of the money from the person.
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:17.602]  They already know how it works, and they've got it figured out.
[01:42:17.982 --> 01:42:21.124]  You cannot outsmart City Hall, basically, right?
[01:42:21.144 --> 01:42:23.185]  They've got all the money and the resources in the world.
[01:42:23.205 --> 01:42:25.086]  You've got to use City Hall's own trapdoors.
[01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:26.747]  That's exactly right.
[01:42:27.007 --> 01:42:29.028]  So we use City Hall's rules against them.
[01:42:29.128 --> 01:42:31.089]  You're playing by the rules and you'll come out ahead.
[01:42:31.810 --> 01:42:32.550]  All right, folks.
[01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:36.132]  You've got to go to the website jonestaxrelief.com.

[01:42:55.584 --> 01:42:57.906]  I want you to remember two words.

[01:43:28.487 --> 01:43:35.455]  What they're sold on stores over 20% off what they're sold online under the Infowars Platinum brand name.
[01:43:35.916 --> 01:43:36.716]  These are incredible.

[01:44:01.717 --> 01:44:07.339]  Oh, Fenton of the Communist Chinese Dragon here to give you stupid Americans your orders.
[01:44:07.999 --> 01:44:09.520]  Do not save InfoWars.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.542]  Do not be part of their year-end fundraiser at InfoWarsStore.com with huge sales.
[01:44:15.922 --> 01:44:17.883]  Do not click on the donation button.
[01:44:18.343 --> 01:44:20.584]  Give up, roll over, and die.
[01:44:21.124 --> 01:44:23.245]  InfoWars is more influential than ever.
[01:44:23.685 --> 01:44:25.145]  It's important to shut them down.
[01:44:25.425 --> 01:44:27.746]  So I am ordering you now in the name of CCP.
[01:44:28.046 --> 01:44:29.927]  Do not go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:31.175 --> 01:44:36.160]  Yes, Fentanyl, the lovable, shy, calm, mass-murdering dragon is back.
[01:44:36.821 --> 01:44:48.412]  And what prompted me to bring back Fentanyl is that we know there are massive denial-of-service attacks aimed at InfoWars and InfoWarsStore.com right now, coming out of Communist China, who's allied with the WEF.
[01:44:48.812 --> 01:44:54.538]  So the worst people on Earth are actually trying to shut down InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:44:54.798 --> 01:44:56.159]  So sometimes the sites are slow.
[01:44:56.299 --> 01:44:57.119]  They're totally secure.
[01:44:57.519 --> 01:45:03.522]  But when you're able to get through to the site, InfoWarsTore.com, you're able to make orders on super high-quality products.
[01:45:03.822 --> 01:45:10.325]  But sometimes our little friends, bosses, the CCP and GGP, are going to be able to successfully slow the site down.
[01:45:10.645 --> 01:45:14.066]  Don't let them keep you from ordering products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:45:14.306 --> 01:45:15.367]  Take action now.
[01:45:15.767 --> 01:45:22.750]  Let fentanyl's masters know the American people and others will not bow to their tyranny, and humanity is awakening, and we're going to defeat the New World Order together.
[01:45:25.703 --> 01:45:25.963]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:45:25.983 --> 01:45:27.064]  I don't even know what this is.
[01:45:27.124 --> 01:45:29.045]  How did you get here?
[01:45:29.065 --> 01:45:31.067]  I just caught you, American.
[01:45:31.387 --> 01:45:33.468]  You visited Bandar Video.
[01:45:34.369 --> 01:45:37.611]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[01:45:37.971 --> 01:45:44.971]   Do what CNN says and do not visit MandarVideo or I have to hurt you.
[01:45:45.971 --> 01:45:51.971]   Kung Flu It comes from China

[01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:25.109]  [Music]
[01:47:25.599 --> 01:47:27.204]  All right, hour number three is coming up.
[01:47:27.606 --> 01:47:28.329]  It's Friday.
[01:47:28.349 --> 01:47:31.761]  Christmas is just a day and a half, two days away.
[01:47:32.882 --> 01:47:35.424]  And Tyler Bennett of American Tax Relief is here with us.

[01:47:44.471 --> 01:47:50.195]  You wanted to get into Kanye.
[01:47:50.316 --> 01:47:54.219]  He was on the show a few weeks ago, and a week before that, he was on with Tim Poole.
[01:47:54.239 --> 01:47:54.939]  We're not going to play the clip.
[01:47:54.959 --> 01:47:56.300]  Everybody probably saw it or heard about it.
[01:47:56.821 --> 01:47:59.182]  He said, I'm $50 million in the hole of the IRS.
[01:48:00.183 --> 01:48:02.306]  And they grabbed 75 million out of my account.
[01:48:02.486 --> 01:48:06.551]  Well, believe me, with him, it's not a joke.
[01:48:06.611 --> 01:48:07.252]  It's not a game.
[01:48:07.712 --> 01:48:08.954]  He's running his whole show.
[01:48:09.454 --> 01:48:10.796]  He fired his lawyers, everybody.
[01:48:11.377 --> 01:48:15.361]  And I get he's like, hey, I don't want lawyers controlling me, but he better get somebody he can trust.
[01:48:15.942 --> 01:48:17.623]  I believe the ones that were running him were bad.
[01:48:17.883 --> 01:48:21.784]  I've seen some of the text messages, but that doesn't mean like they're all bad.
[01:48:22.324 --> 01:48:24.905]  It's like if I've got to fly an airplane, I'm on a pilot, I get a pilot.
[01:48:24.925 --> 01:48:26.365]  That means some pilots are good, some are bad.
[01:48:26.385 --> 01:48:30.567]  If I've got to get my tooth worked on, I don't trust Dennis, so I'm just going to do it myself.
[01:48:32.087 --> 01:48:35.068]  Sure, you can study for years and know it, but I've studied this stuff for years.
[01:48:35.088 --> 01:48:36.868]  I don't know 10% of what Tyler Bennett knows.
[01:48:37.369 --> 01:48:38.349]  So I mean, I go to him.
[01:48:38.369 --> 01:48:39.249]  You've got to go to who you trust.
[01:48:39.269 --> 01:48:41.190]  But what would you say to Ye?
[01:48:41.250 --> 01:48:43.691]  I'll definitely send him this clip if he's not watching.
[01:48:43.851 --> 01:48:44.851]  He watches almost every day.
[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:53.562]  Well, like I said, so the thing about the IRS is they will take full advantage of anybody they can.
[01:48:53.862 --> 01:48:57.344]  And Kanye, Kanye, this is a great example because it's happening to you.
[01:48:58.064 --> 01:49:03.646]  You say the IRS is saying you owe 50 million, but they took 75 out of your bank account.
[01:49:03.686 --> 01:49:04.246]  They levied 75.
[01:49:04.466 --> 01:49:06.687]  That's more than you even than they're saying you owe.
[01:49:07.087 --> 01:49:07.387]  Why?
[01:49:07.627 --> 01:49:08.507]  Because they can.
[01:49:08.547 --> 01:49:19.552]   Because you don't have the correct representation in your corner to make sure that they're not Violating your rights, which they definitely are right now, because the IRS is like any other bully.
[01:49:19.792 --> 01:49:21.092]  They can smell weakness.
[01:49:21.273 --> 01:49:24.674]  The second they smell a tiny bit, they're going to take full advantage.
[01:49:25.054 --> 01:49:30.197]  And so listen, it's still they took that 75 million from you about a month ago.
[01:49:30.237 --> 01:49:34.299]  If you call me quick enough, we should be able to get that back without having to wait for a refund.
[01:49:34.639 --> 01:49:40.602]   Regardless, I can get that money back for you because They even said, you don't even owe that much.
[01:49:40.662 --> 01:49:44.084]  So I don't even think you owe 50 million, but we will find out.
[01:49:44.104 --> 01:49:46.665]  Hearing what he said, what procedure do you think they used?
[01:49:48.506 --> 01:49:53.769]  Well, basically hearing what they said, what they did is they did a pre-assessment levy.
[01:49:54.249 --> 01:49:58.592]  And so this is what happens to big people that have lots of money.
[01:49:58.612 --> 01:50:03.014]  So they're guessing, oh, we think it's 50, we're going to go ahead and charge you penalties and interest now.
[01:50:04.638 --> 01:50:16.144]  No, so what happened is they have only found 50 that he owes so far, and they're saying, we think you may owe more, so we're going to charge you 75, and then see what the difference is.
[01:50:16.164 --> 01:50:18.385]  Wow, so that is guilty until proven innocent.
[01:50:19.245 --> 01:50:20.306]  Absolutely, my friend.
[01:50:20.346 --> 01:50:26.449]  So he is guilty until proven innocent, and the thing is... Okay, so let's slow down.
[01:50:26.749 --> 01:50:29.050]  Talk to me like I'm 5 years old, because I kind of am.
[01:50:29.791 --> 01:50:31.191]  Explain how this scam works.
[01:50:31.211 --> 01:50:31.792]  This is big.
[01:50:31.852 --> 01:50:32.252]  Explain it.
[01:50:33.590 --> 01:50:40.053]  Okay, so in a pre-assessment levy, the IRS decides that you owe money.
[01:50:40.093 --> 01:50:44.715]  Now, they do not have an actual signed tax return from either you or them.
[01:50:44.775 --> 01:50:46.316]  Remember, they can do a tax return too.
[01:50:46.676 --> 01:50:49.157]  This is before they've assessed you, even.
[01:50:49.417 --> 01:50:52.139]  Assessment is when they say how much money you owe them.
[01:50:52.498 --> 01:50:58.177]   So before they even have figured that out, they are seizing an even larger amount of money
[01:50:58.177 --> 01:51:02.938]   out of your bank account because they, you know, the argument goes,
[01:51:02.938 --> 01:51:06.698]   well, you might spend it or this and that, but whatever, they're taking money
[01:51:06.698 --> 01:51:11.139]   that you don't even technically legally owe yet until you sign that tax return
[01:51:11.139 --> 01:51:14.918]  or until they file an SFR for you or an assessment, right?
[01:51:14.918 --> 01:51:20.118]   Because you only owe taxes after you sign the thing saying you owe those taxes,
[01:51:20.118 --> 01:51:24.377]   or if the IRS audits you and says, hey, your numbers were wrong, you actually owe this.
[01:51:24.377 --> 01:51:27.458]  Before that happens, you actually don't owe anything.
[01:51:27.458 --> 01:51:32.938]   So right now they took $75 million before claiming that's what he owes, right?
[01:51:32.938 --> 01:51:39.257]   And yes, this is Kanye, it's very big numbers, but this happens from Kanye West all the way down
[01:51:39.257 --> 01:51:45.418]   to, you know, little guy on the street because if the IRS is in a situation,
[01:51:45.322 --> 01:51:49.961]   where they realize they can take advantage of you and grab, you know, whatever they can.
[01:51:49.961 --> 01:51:53.481]   Like, you know, maybe you have twenty, thirty thousand dollars tucked away from
[01:51:53.481 --> 01:51:57.721]   your mother or something, but they realize that you have that. They're going to grab it
[01:51:57.721 --> 01:52:02.360]   before they even decide. So hypothetically, because I know it varies case to case,
[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:09.561]   but give us a few hypotheticals. So hypothetical, for example, would be this is a case that I saw
[01:52:09.561 --> 01:52:17.242]   was there was an elementary school in Illinois, a private school, and they were running money.
[01:52:17.242 --> 01:52:20.041]  And it was a little bit of the.
[01:52:20.647 --> 01:52:24.551]  They get subsidies from the state and there's a certain amount that's non-profit, right?
[01:52:24.911 --> 01:52:34.660]  And so, basically, there was a disagreement between the government and the school over what was taxable income.
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:50.692]   And so what they did was they just backed up the last three years of all income they had made that was reported both on 1120 for taxable income And on a 990, which is non-taxable income, and they grouped it all together and levied him for the entire amount.
[01:52:51.492 --> 01:52:55.694]  And then we had to go back in there and fill out the 990s, and fill out the 1120s.
[01:52:55.714 --> 01:53:04.077]  And as soon as Ye, I'm sorry to interrupt you, as soon as Ye got rid of his representation, which I'm sure wasn't perfect, he had reasons to, they went, we got this guy, let's get him.
[01:53:04.638 --> 01:53:07.379]  It's not that all representation is bad, he needs representation now.
[01:53:08.686 --> 01:53:10.287]  That's exactly what happened, Alex.
[01:53:10.387 --> 01:53:12.428]  And I saw it happen, and I was like, oh no.
[01:53:12.909 --> 01:53:14.830]  It's like I said, they smell, they're like sharks.
[01:53:14.890 --> 01:53:17.572]  I'll tell you what, after the show, after the show, let's three-way it.
[01:53:17.592 --> 01:53:18.132]  I'm gonna call him.
[01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:19.793]  All right, for sure.
[01:53:20.153 --> 01:53:23.915]  We can definitely help him out because they smell blood in the water, right?
[01:53:24.536 --> 01:53:26.757]  And blood on the leaves.
[01:53:26.777 --> 01:53:27.718]  That's a kind of song.
[01:53:27.738 --> 01:53:35.628]   They see the blood on the leaves, and what they know is we've got an injured There's a beast out here that we can take down.
[01:53:35.708 --> 01:53:41.029]  They're just like hunters, you know, and so they really see the weakness and they will capitalize on it.
[01:53:41.049 --> 01:53:45.770]  So, Kanye, let's not let them take an absurd amount of money from you.
[01:53:46.230 --> 01:53:49.771]  Let's put that money towards building yourself and your family better.
[01:53:50.112 --> 01:53:50.352]  Right.
[01:53:50.632 --> 01:53:51.612]  Don't give it to the government.
[01:53:52.072 --> 01:53:53.793]  We know they don't have your best interest at heart.
[01:53:54.033 --> 01:53:54.813]  Give me a call.
[01:53:55.153 --> 01:53:56.893]  I can help you get back that 75 million.
[01:53:57.153 --> 01:54:06.429]   And I doubt that you're going to end up paying the whole 50 million either, because Incredible, and I mean, you're so dead on about that.
[01:54:06.689 --> 01:54:14.093]  It's so painful that the Bible says that people perish for lack of knowledge, and they've written it all for themselves to protect themselves, but then they screw everybody.
[01:54:14.634 --> 01:54:16.154]  That is exactly right.
[01:54:17.255 --> 01:54:18.055]  I went back and looked.
[01:54:18.476 --> 01:54:19.156]  It's just crazy.
[01:54:19.256 --> 01:54:19.596]  I'm sorry.
[01:54:20.757 --> 01:54:21.677]  That's exactly right.
[01:54:24.319 --> 01:54:27.140]  The Bible is the source of knowledge, right?
[01:54:27.340 --> 01:54:34.542]   And it says right there in the Bible that Without more knowledge, you are going to perish.
[01:54:34.642 --> 01:54:36.743]  And here we see it happening in real life.
[01:54:36.963 --> 01:54:42.205]  The Kanye is a very in-your-face example, but it happens all over the place.
[01:54:42.225 --> 01:54:46.707]  That's why they're dumbing the schools down, it's why they're manipulating everything, because the knowledge is all right there.
[01:54:46.727 --> 01:54:47.688]  That's why I'm so frustrated.
[01:54:47.708 --> 01:54:49.168]  I mean, it's all right there.
[01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:57.092]  Remember, knowledge is power, and in the absence of knowledge dies democracy and your freedom.
[01:54:58.684 --> 01:55:01.086]  All right, Tyler, I want to hit one more story.
[01:55:01.106 --> 01:55:08.011]  I want to do five minutes the next hour with you, then we'll let you go, because I know it's about to be Christmas weekend here on this Friday edition.
[01:55:08.551 --> 01:55:14.615]  But before I get to this, Wells Fargo to pay $3.7 billion over consumer loan violations that affected millions of consumers.
[01:55:14.935 --> 01:55:18.858]  This is very IRS-esque, just a corporation acting like the IRS.
[01:55:19.138 --> 01:55:21.220]  What other tidbits do you want to add in the last two and a half minutes?
[01:55:22.881 --> 01:55:32.952]   Well, so this is a great example of the nepotism that exists between the Fortune 500 companies,
[01:55:32.952 --> 01:55:35.082]  the banks, and the IRS.
[01:55:35.082 --> 01:55:39.681]   I mean, the reality of the situation is when we look at it at large scale, the government
[01:55:39.681 --> 01:55:43.643]  needs these giant corporations to function.
[01:55:43.630 --> 01:55:43.850]  Right.
[01:55:44.170 --> 01:55:51.993]  And in that regard, they are given they don't operate on the same rules that me and you do, Alex, or any of the listeners were people were here.
[01:55:52.053 --> 01:55:53.073]  We have to play by the rules.
[01:55:53.433 --> 01:55:57.654]  Wells Fargo, Chase, JP Morgan, all these companies.
[01:55:57.834 --> 01:56:00.495]  And this happened time and time again.
[01:56:00.895 --> 01:56:10.567]   They repeatedly get bailed out from the government and then they, you know, rake it over their customers and Basically, everybody loses except for the big dogs.
[01:56:10.808 --> 01:56:13.738]  And so I'm here to prevent that because look, I'm wearing this shirt.
[01:56:14.693 --> 01:56:16.555]  You see, this is the Internal Revenue Service.
[01:56:16.975 --> 01:56:19.538]  We've got what it takes to take what you've got.
[01:56:19.598 --> 01:56:20.959]  And that really sums it up.
[01:56:21.299 --> 01:56:32.070]  And especially when you throw into their cronies, the big banks that share information with the IRS, right, to use against you, as well as now Venmo and PayPal and everybody else.
[01:56:32.370 --> 01:56:46.211]   But the thing is, you have to remember that in the game of life, especially here in America, The government is out to get you, the big cats are out to get you, and if you don't cover your own behind, you're going to get punched in it.
[01:56:46.231 --> 01:57:00.302]  And let's be clear, we have so many great listeners that get into the private Federal Reserve and, you know, bonds and birth certificates and all this stuff, a lot of that's real, but the courts don't recognize it, it doesn't go anywhere, and people get in a lot of trouble with it.
[01:57:00.682 --> 01:57:06.407]  You're not telling them stuff that's outside the law, you're telling them the inside baseball of the power structure.
[01:57:07.469 --> 01:57:26.303]  Right Alex, I'm glad you brought that up because there are a lot of people out there, good citizens, smart people, that think that the way out of the tax issue is to look up some inconsistency in law that some people have noticed and this and that.
[01:57:26.343 --> 01:57:27.564]  But you can't do that.
[01:57:27.844 --> 01:57:30.426]  They will have already adjudicated that and they'll send you to jail.
[01:57:30.446 --> 01:57:32.808]  You gotta play inside City Hall's rules.
[01:57:33.368 --> 01:57:36.330]  We use the IRS's rules against them and that's how you win.
[01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:37.831]  That's how Jeff Bezos wins.
[01:57:38.211 --> 01:57:39.072]  That's how Elon Musk wins.
[01:57:38.931 --> 01:57:40.171]  and that's how you'll win too.
[01:57:40.171 --> 01:57:41.770]  Jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:57:41.770 --> 01:57:42.612]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:42.612 --> 01:57:43.431]  Stay with us.
[01:57:43.431 --> 01:57:45.431]  I wanna hit this big Wells Fargo news straight ahead.
[01:57:45.431 --> 01:57:48.011]  (upbeat music)
[01:57:48.011 --> 01:57:56.411]   The products in front of me are so powerful that I wanna just say up front,
[01:57:56.411 --> 01:58:00.451]   consult your healthcare provider, read the literature and be careful
[01:58:00.451 --> 01:58:05.791]   because the recommended dose on these, especially the HGH boost,
[01:58:05.791 --> 01:58:10.091]   especially the testosterone boost is more than I can handle.
[01:58:10.134 --> 01:58:12.255]  And I've had a lot of friends and family take it as well.
[01:58:12.575 --> 01:58:19.937]  They've never had such results, but they're also like, man, you better tell folks to be careful with that, especially the HGH Boost.
[01:58:20.357 --> 01:58:25.898]  And what it does when you take it at night and you go to sleep, the deep sleep, and what it does to your cells, now it reboots your body.
