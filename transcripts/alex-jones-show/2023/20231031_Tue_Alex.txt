[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:05.134]  Remember, the IMF and World Bank control almost every third world country through BlackRock and through their loans.
[00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:10.059]  For over two and a half years, they were completely shut down, starving to death.
[00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:13.562]  You notice how skinny many of these victims of the New World Order are.
[00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:23.128]   But once they get here, they're brought in and given voter IDs, driver's license, And are allowed to vote.
[00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:31.474]  Now happening in Chicago, New York City, San Francisco have passed laws for illegal aliens to vote and to be police officers.
[00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:33.635]  Bombshell!
[00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:39.239]  Biden regime deploys heavy machinery, bulldozers to lift razor wire for massive mob of illegals at Rio Grande.
[00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.002]  From the great reporting of BorderHawk.
[00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:50.127]  While they have distracted us from the war in the Middle East, a massive caravan is marching to storm our border.
[00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:50.547]  This is...
[00:00:51.653 --> 00:00:53.574]  Not a crisis, this is an invasion.
[00:00:58.137 --> 00:01:02.920]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.722]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:09.044 --> 00:01:11.086]  The occult activities are coming up.
[00:01:11.546 --> 00:01:16.049]  And then after the actual ritual, we're going to give you some more of the history surrounding it.
[00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:23.570]  But first off, I wanted to draw your attention to the program that was given out to the spectators, or the viewers.
[00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:34.197]  I guess an occultist would call them novices, who actually watched as the priest and their supporters engaged in this ancient rite.
[00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:39.220]  Now, you're looking at a little demon called PJ that was on the front of the actual program.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.022]  It's kind of in a Hieronymus Bosch style.
[00:01:42.082 --> 00:01:45.944]  He's got a little broom and a dustpan, and he's sweeping something up.
[00:01:46.562 --> 00:01:52.868]  Now, even more shocking is the figure of a human body burning in the flames.
[00:01:52.928 --> 00:02:02.558]  In fact, I've shown it to people that are experts in anatomy, to actual doctors, and they say that the anatomical size is that of a baby or small child.
[00:02:02.858 --> 00:02:07.462]  Notice how large the cranium is in comparison to the torso, that is, the ribs.
[00:02:08.243 --> 00:02:17.667]  Understand, ladies and gentlemen, this is from the program itself given out to the establishment lackeys witnessing these sinister activities.
[00:02:18.327 --> 00:02:22.569]  Remember, in Babylon entire, they would throw their children into fiery pits.
[00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:25.450]  Look at the size of the hands compared to the rest of the body.
[00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:29.112]  Only children show these anatomical details.
[00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:32.573]  At long last, here it is, the cremation of care unveiled.
[00:02:34.808 --> 00:02:56.808]  [crowd noise]
[00:02:56.808 --> 00:03:01.808]   As we sat there in the darkness, not knowing what we were about to see in the gathering crowd,
[00:03:01.808 --> 00:03:07.808]   suddenly, across the small lake, we saw a carriage with men in black and brown cloaks,
[00:03:07.808 --> 00:03:11.808]  robes in front and in back, bearing a bound body.
[00:03:11.808 --> 00:03:13.067]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:12.711 --> 00:03:16.711]  Remember it was a hidden camera and at somewhat of an angle.
[00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:19.711]  [Music]
[00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:22.711]  [Music]
[00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:28.711]  [Music]
[00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:34.711]  [Music]
[00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:40.711]  [Music]
[00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:47.711]  [Music]
[00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:50.711]  [Music]
[00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:54.711]  [Applause]
[00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:56.951]  (applause)
[00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:59.191]  (applause)
[00:03:59.224 --> 00:04:11.712]  Something particularly pleasing was happening for the Bohemian Grovers with whatever developed with that crowd of men in black and brown and the bound body on the back of the buggy.
[00:04:11.812 --> 00:04:15.655]  They drove behind big black tarps they had hanging out of the trees.
[00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:21.038]  There was lots of smacking on lips and bizarre enjoyment by the crowd.
[00:04:20.877 --> 00:04:26.478]   We still haven't made out exactly what was going on, but that a real sacrifice may have actually been developing
[00:04:26.478 --> 00:04:28.176]  according to some occult experts.
[00:04:28.176 --> 00:04:38.877]  [Music]
[00:04:38.877 --> 00:04:45.957]   All the time in the darkness across the small lake, the men in black were doing something behind the dark
[00:04:45.957 --> 00:04:47.877]  curtains hanging from the redwood trees.
[00:04:48.636 --> 00:04:54.101]  Then after about 10 more minutes of music, suddenly, all around the owl, activity began.
[00:04:54.501 --> 00:04:56.463]  Here is the main central part of the ritual.
[00:05:00.812 --> 00:05:03.254]  The owl is in his leafy temple.
[00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:08.839]  Let all within the grove be reverent before him.
[00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:16.325]  Lift up your heads, O ye trees, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting spires.
[00:05:17.165 --> 00:05:25.966]   For behold, here is Bohemian shrine, and holy are the pillars of this house.
[00:05:25.966 --> 00:05:27.966]  [bell rings]
[00:05:27.966 --> 00:05:33.165]  Leaving the minors shall not enter.
[00:05:33.165 --> 00:05:35.165]  [bell rings]
[00:05:35.165 --> 00:06:03.165]  [wind]
[00:06:03.893 --> 00:06:15.142]  With the ripple of waters, the song of birds, such music as inspires the sinking soul, may we invite you into midsummer's joy.
[00:06:15.482 --> 00:06:20.386]  The sky above is blue, and so are the stars.
[00:06:22.227 --> 00:06:27.631]  The forest floor is neat with fragrant drift.
[00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:29.433]  Leaping's cool kiss is yours.
[00:06:29.933 --> 00:06:32.055]  The campfire's glowed.
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.941]  The birth of Rosie Finger gone.
[00:06:36.862 --> 00:06:38.923]  Shake off your sorrows with the city's dust.
[00:06:38.943 --> 00:06:42.145]  Attached to the winds and the cares of life.
[00:06:43.025 --> 00:06:51.249]  Let memory bring back the well-loved names of gallant friends who knew and loved this world.
[00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.352]  Dear loon companions of the long-ago.
[00:06:56.672 --> 00:06:56.872]  Aye!
[00:06:57.893 --> 00:06:59.353]  Let them join us in this wisdom.
[00:06:59.474 --> 00:07:01.795]  Not a face be empty in our vision.
[00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:04.572]  I hope you're his vassals.
[00:07:05.693 --> 00:07:12.080]  Behold in this grey autumn of the world, or springtime in your heart, a ten-hour tale.
[00:07:13.241 --> 00:07:20.047]  Gather ye, forest folk, and cast your spell over these mortals.
[00:07:20.147 --> 00:07:25.413]  Touch their world-blind eyes with very unknown.
[00:07:25.553 --> 00:07:32.844]   Open their eyes Follow the memories of yesterday and seal the gates of sorrow.
[00:07:34.446 --> 00:07:35.147]  It is a dream.
[00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:38.612]  And yet, it's not all a dream.
[00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:44.843]  Don't care in all of his works, or hers.
[00:07:44.863 --> 00:07:50.005]  As vanished Babylon and driddling Tyre, so shall they also then.
[00:07:50.885 --> 00:08:00.609]  But the wilding rose blows on the broken battlements of Tyre, and wafts through the rich stones of Babylon.
[00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:07.572]  For beauty is eternal, and we vow to beauty everlasting.
[00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:10.928]  More lasting happiness.
[00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:13.169]  Return to one alone.
[00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.611]  As she surrounds you now.
[00:08:16.892 --> 00:08:19.254]  Great nature.
[00:08:19.334 --> 00:08:20.495]  Refuge of the weary heart.
[00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:24.177]  And only bond for persons that have been bruised.
[00:08:24.197 --> 00:08:28.440]  She have cool hands for every fevered brow.
[00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:31.943]  And gentlest silence for the troubled soul.
[00:08:33.784 --> 00:08:35.145]  Consoles her most wives.
[00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:37.547]  She healeth well.
[00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:46.028]  Having such ministries as calm and sleep, she is ever faithful.
[00:08:46.048 --> 00:08:51.552]  Other friends may fail, but she can keep her in any quiet place.
[00:08:52.993 --> 00:08:56.456]  Smiling, she will rise and give to you her kiss.
[00:08:58.097 --> 00:09:01.680]  So must she come as children.
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:06.003]  Little children that believe don't ever doubt her beauty and her faith.
[00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:10.679]  Your game for tenderness can change your God.
[00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:12.679]  [Birds chirping]
[00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:39.679]  [Music]
[00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:43.120]  It's Tuesday, October 31st, 2023.
[00:09:43.154 --> 00:09:44.274]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:09:45.055 --> 00:10:08.042]  You're watching footage from a TV viewer of heavy bulldozers smashing through barbed wire fencing put in by the state of Texas, despite the fact that multiple federal judges in the last month have ordered Biden to stop violating the integrity of the state of Texas and Texas's right back from the main border to put up fences on the Rio Grande.
[00:10:09.619 --> 00:10:14.022]  This is the planned, coordinated takedown of the United States.
[00:10:14.042 --> 00:10:18.445]  There are over 10 million illegal aliens that have come in in just the last year.
[00:10:18.465 --> 00:10:23.629]  It's over 20 million is the real numbers I get from the Border Patrol in the last two and a half years since Biden stole the election.
[00:10:24.409 --> 00:10:25.090]  Here are the headlines.
[00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.672]  Judge orders feds to stop cutting states razor wire along Rio Grande.
[00:10:29.833 --> 00:10:31.034]  But they don't care.
[00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:35.337]  They just continue it because they use the courts when they rule the way they want.
[00:10:35.957 --> 00:10:38.159]  When the courts don't rule the way they want, they go ahead with it.
[00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:49.705]  The human smuggling, the sex trafficking, the slave labor, it's all even confirmed by the New York Times and Senate reports, much worse than what they're reporting is actually going on.
[00:10:52.006 --> 00:10:59.229]  Hundreds of thousands of military-age men every couple weeks are coming across from all over the world.
[00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:04.231]  And the same thing's being done to Europe as well.
[00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:11.154]  But counterbalancing all this tyranny is the Great Awakening that we're in the middle of right now.
[00:11:12.475 --> 00:11:20.101]  Elon Musk came out today, the story's on InfoWars.com, and said, the Great Awakening from woke has happened.
[00:11:21.182 --> 00:11:31.750]  And as I told you, this broadcast is the tip of the spear for the talking points for all of the most prominent resistors to the globalist plan.
[00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.828]   Whether you think Musk is for real or not is Academic.
[00:11:36.808 --> 00:11:42.714]  Musk is now taking, at least for a year, everything I say word-for-word and boosting it back out there to the world.
[00:11:43.414 --> 00:11:45.196]  It's quite interesting, and I'll leave it at that.
[00:11:45.236 --> 00:11:47.118]  And it's not about saying, oh, aren't we great?
[00:11:47.798 --> 00:11:51.261]  It's about listeners realizing how effective this transmission is.
[00:11:52.723 --> 00:11:54.684]  But this is a long-term battle with the globalists.
[00:11:55.285 --> 00:11:56.306]  They want to wear us out.
[00:11:56.346 --> 00:11:58.748]  They want to just make things so bad that we just give up.
[00:11:59.669 --> 00:12:01.631]  We cannot do that.
[00:12:02.705 --> 00:12:03.765]  We have to be strong.
[00:12:04.565 --> 00:12:08.226]  And quite frankly, listeners have to support this transmission.
[00:12:08.366 --> 00:12:09.587]  I'm going to hit all the news.
[00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:11.007]  Putin's come out against Israel.
[00:12:11.827 --> 00:12:13.267]  Things are getting really insane.
[00:12:14.228 --> 00:12:16.448]  This is shaping up to get really, really bad.
[00:12:19.249 --> 00:12:20.909]  We've got incredible financial news.
[00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:28.511]  We've got incredible federal announcements by Biden against the Second Amendment, against property rights, and more.
[00:12:30.225 --> 00:12:34.108]  Local real estate groups estimate that Mar-a-Lago is worth $300 million.
[00:12:34.528 --> 00:12:43.954]  They've had offers to buy it for $500 million, but the judge just allowed fake evidence on against Trump that it's only worth $27 million now, and that Trump is a liar.
[00:12:45.696 --> 00:12:46.296]  It's incredible.
[00:12:46.316 --> 00:12:50.439]  They'll send you to prison for a crooked toenail while they commit mass crimes against humanity right out in the open.
[00:12:50.859 --> 00:12:53.081]  It's all coming up today.
[00:12:54.875 --> 00:13:12.048]  But just on the subject of InfoWars, I normally get ready hours and hours before the show, but I've been here this morning, since the early morning, doing accounting on free speech systems, my own personal accounting, with two different accounting teams, one that does free speech, the other that does myself.
[00:13:13.206 --> 00:13:19.373]  And that's why you see the lying news headlines everywhere that I've got hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:13:19.493 --> 00:13:20.634]  I don't have millions of dollars.
[00:13:21.275 --> 00:13:26.580]  And I'm in the process of selling anything extra I've got in the bankruptcy process, and I don't care about that.
[00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:30.244]  What I do care about is keeping this operation on air.
[00:13:31.752 --> 00:13:54.632]  Now, you can decide to let The Globalist take us down, or you can decide to get great products that enrich you and your family's life, and enrich your community's life, and enrich your understanding of the New World Order, in the case of books and films and things like that, at InfoWarsTore.com, or you can decide to just say, well, we don't need InfoWars, because that's really what it comes down to, and InfoWars is so effective.
[00:13:56.075 --> 00:13:57.295]  In the fight against the globalists.
[00:13:57.335 --> 00:14:00.576]  Work we did 20-something years ago is just now breaking into the mainstream.
[00:14:00.937 --> 00:14:04.278]  From Bohemian Grove to Skull & Bones, that's viral everywhere today.
[00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:08.599]  Tens of millions of views just the last 24 hours of our old videos.
[00:14:09.199 --> 00:14:10.559]  Doesn't bring any capital into us.
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:11.720]  That's okay.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.421]  When it comes to the capital of the mind and alerting people, we are very, very rich.
[00:14:17.322 --> 00:14:18.222]  But it takes funds.
[00:14:18.302 --> 00:14:19.702]  So we have the new big sale going.
[00:14:20.102 --> 00:14:21.183]  Rainforce Ultra.
[00:14:22.683 --> 00:14:22.903]  60% off.

[00:14:34.089 --> 00:14:35.029]  We're just sold out of that.
[00:14:35.529 --> 00:14:37.010]  The female formula has a pink label.
[00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.131]  It's the same formula.
[00:14:38.171 --> 00:14:39.151]  Works great for your libido.
[00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:40.552]  Superfemale vitality.
[00:14:40.632 --> 00:14:41.552]  Imphalworks.com.
[00:14:42.252 --> 00:14:44.353]  If you want to support the broadcast, you should do that.
[00:14:44.433 --> 00:14:56.175]   Also, everybody, Should have a bottle or multiple bottles of high-quality, 30 parts per million, colloidal silver in their medicine cabinet, you know, out at your farmhouse, at your office.
[00:14:57.075 --> 00:14:59.957]  This is what you do topically when you've got a cut or a sore.
[00:14:59.977 --> 00:15:00.958]  It does great things.
[00:15:01.358 --> 00:15:02.819]  Super antibacterial, antiviral.
[00:15:03.359 --> 00:15:07.241]  It's what I like to take under my tongue whenever I feel like I'm having a sore throat or something.
[00:15:07.301 --> 00:15:12.283]  I'll gargle with a bunch of it and then I will, you know, obviously gargle with salt water as well, but the two together is amazing.
[00:15:12.664 --> 00:15:13.544]  I'll put a few drops of this.
[00:15:13.563 --> 00:15:20.004]   have a sinus infection in clean distilled water, do the neti pot, a little bit of salt
[00:15:20.004 --> 00:15:22.842]   solution and it works so much better than just salt solution.
[00:15:22.842 --> 00:15:26.363]   For me personally, I don't have to tell you how great coital silver is.
[00:15:26.363 --> 00:15:28.764]   30 parts per million is seen as the safest and most effective.
[00:15:28.764 --> 00:15:32.403]   You can get it stronger but then it starts having a toxic effect.
[00:15:32.403 --> 00:15:33.403]  It kills stuff.
[00:15:33.403 --> 00:15:36.442]  It's not a game, folks.
[00:15:36.442 --> 00:15:40.524]  It's a metal-based system of antibiotic.
[00:15:40.524 --> 00:15:42.963]  But it's not technically an antibiotic.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.621]  So if you want it, have it in your medicine chest.
[00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:48.242]  I've been promoting silver 29 years on air.
[00:15:48.262 --> 00:15:50.823]  They attacked it for the first 10 years, said it wasn't real.
[00:15:51.423 --> 00:15:56.585]  Now you go to CVS or you go to Whole Foods, they're selling the exact same stuff under another label.
[00:15:57.777 --> 00:16:00.838]  Some of it not even as good, because it's now recognized.
[00:16:00.938 --> 00:16:03.678]  If you go to hospitals, the iodine quit working for topical.
[00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.959]  Now they spray silver solution to knock out stuff on surfaces.
[00:16:07.459 --> 00:16:09.940]  This is the best you're going to get, and it supports broadcasts.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:14.101]  Buy the staple products you need at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:16.581]  Buy it from the good guys, and keep us on air.
[00:16:17.361 --> 00:16:19.982]  You got Elon Musk talking about the Great Wokening.
[00:16:21.215 --> 00:16:22.636]  The Great Wokening is here.
[00:16:22.696 --> 00:16:25.259]  Yes, The Great Awakening is here.
[00:16:25.479 --> 00:16:29.302]  I've got the book, The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalist and Launching the Next Great Renaissance.
[00:16:29.422 --> 00:16:32.925]  I need people to go buy the signed copy that's a fundraiser.
[00:16:32.965 --> 00:16:33.786]  We need the funds.
[00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.208]  Limited signed copies, infowarestore.com.
[00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:37.750]  Or buy the unsigned copy.
[00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.793]  It's twice as long as The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[00:16:41.853 --> 00:16:43.655]  That is basically part one to this.
[00:16:44.576 --> 00:16:45.396]  It's important.
[00:16:45.436 --> 00:16:47.458]  Get yours at infowarestore.com.
[00:16:48.809 --> 00:16:49.650]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:58.377]  I just need you to make the decision consciously to say, I'm not going to support this broadcast, and I don't think it's that important.
[00:16:58.577 --> 00:17:02.100]  Or decide, wow, this transmission needs my support.
[00:17:02.461 --> 00:17:04.042]  Please support our local Eminem affiliates.
[00:17:04.402 --> 00:17:05.423]  Please support our sponsors.
[00:17:06.204 --> 00:17:08.686]  But we are in a major fight with the deep state.
[00:17:09.267 --> 00:17:12.769]  We have been holding them off, and it takes funds to do this.
[00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:17.331]  And I cannot do it without your support.
[00:17:18.012 --> 00:17:32.457]  Also, InfoWars Platinum products are three private labeled products that are already national bestsellers that have great reviews in PainMD for pain relief, 7076 Testosterone Boost to boost your natural testosterone and other great things.
[00:17:32.557 --> 00:17:38.139]  Works incredibly well in my experience and others' experiences, five-star reviews, and HGH Max Boost.
[00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:41.388]  Which is extremely popular and is about to sell out.
[00:17:41.468 --> 00:17:44.852]  And who knows if we'll have funds going forward to even buy these things.
[00:17:44.952 --> 00:17:49.537]  If we don't get more support, the t-shirts, the books, the films, I'll tell you, will be the end of this.
[00:17:50.497 --> 00:17:54.642]  And we won't just shut down overnight and the crew will have three to six months.
[00:17:55.202 --> 00:17:58.866]  But I mean, I can easily come in here in the next month and say, okay, we got four months.
[00:17:59.307 --> 00:17:59.647]  That's it.
[00:17:59.667 --> 00:18:00.368]  We're closing down.
[00:18:01.567 --> 00:18:14.092]  So, I'll still be, you know, some new place on the air, and it'll take time to build back, it'll be terrible for the crew, the enemy will see it as a big victory, but I can only fight as hard as you support us, and I'm not bitching at you.
[00:18:14.152 --> 00:18:20.535]  And the good part of this is, I've not backed down, I've gone through living hell, I've only intensified my operations, and I'm not a quitter.
[00:18:21.562 --> 00:18:25.464]  And so, subconsciously, I catch myself going, oh great, I can take a rest here.
[00:18:25.485 --> 00:18:26.565]  I'm like, no!
[00:18:26.765 --> 00:18:28.827]  I'm gonna fight harder, even though I hate begging.
[00:18:28.847 --> 00:18:33.890]  I hate giving in or losing, even worse, to these psycho tyrants.
[00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.211]  So they really want us shut down.
[00:18:36.251 --> 00:18:37.532]  They really want Tucker shut down.
[00:18:37.552 --> 00:18:38.573]  They want Trump shut down.
[00:18:39.033 --> 00:18:40.934]  They're coming after Elon Musk now, for real.
[00:18:41.354 --> 00:18:42.515]  He's doubling down against them.
[00:18:42.815 --> 00:18:45.497]  Say what you want about him in the past, you know a man buys enemies.
[00:18:45.857 --> 00:18:48.078]  But I don't have billions of dollars like Elon Musk or Trump.
[00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:49.679]  I got you and that's it.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.681]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:59.222]  I need your support, plus these are amazing products you need right now.
[00:18:59.962 --> 00:19:01.182]  Infowars, platinum and more.
[00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:04.763]  Colloidal Silver, Silver Bullet, get Colloidal Silver.
[00:19:04.843 --> 00:19:07.324]  Everybody needs it and everybody needs to fund the First Amendment.
[00:19:07.524 --> 00:19:08.404]  So it's a win-win.
[00:19:08.504 --> 00:19:12.925]  Go get Silver Bullet now and Super Film Vitality at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:13.885 --> 00:19:17.746]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Halloween edition All Saints Eve.
[00:19:20.862 --> 00:19:30.656]  If you go to InfoWars.com, you can see scores of the videos bombshell Biden regime deploys heavy machinery, bulldozers to smash through razor wire for massive bomb of illegals at Rio Grande.
[00:19:31.817 --> 00:19:32.378]  Eagle Pass.
[00:19:34.221 --> 00:19:34.962]  Here's one of the reports.
[00:19:36.363 --> 00:19:39.365]  I'm Efrain Gonzalez, correspondent with BorderHug News.
[00:19:39.524 --> 00:19:46.644]   These are exclusive images of how mass crossings of hundreds of migrants are being carried out in recent days
[00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:50.524]  at Eagle Pass, raising the barbed wire with machinery.
[00:19:50.524 --> 00:19:59.524]   This huge caravan of around 300 migrants crossed into Eagle Pass thanks to Border Patrol agents lifting the barbed wire.
[00:19:59.524 --> 00:20:02.524]  The hundreds of migrants crossed in a few minutes.
[00:20:02.524 --> 00:20:07.524]   This being the four massive crossings that our cameras witnessed in the last days.
[00:20:07.524 --> 00:20:10.526]  To cross the Bravo River with your kids or CBP-1?
[00:20:10.566 --> 00:20:12.988]  To cross the Bravo River, first in the name of God.
[00:20:13.068 --> 00:20:14.589]  It takes a long time.
[00:20:14.548 --> 00:20:17.229]  a waste them with four leaf tractors.
[00:20:17.229 --> 00:20:23.189]   Given these facilities, migrants say they prefer to cross the river instead of processing
[00:20:23.189 --> 00:20:24.189]  legal entry.
[00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:25.189]  [Spanish]
[00:20:25.189 --> 00:20:26.189]  [Spanish]
[00:20:26.189 --> 00:20:27.189]  [Spanish]
[00:20:27.189 --> 00:20:28.189]  [Spanish]
[00:20:28.189 --> 00:20:29.189]  [Spanish]
[00:20:29.189 --> 00:20:30.189]  [Spanish]
[00:20:30.189 --> 00:20:31.189]  [Spanish]
[00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:32.189]  [Spanish]
[00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:33.189]  [Spanish]
[00:20:33.189 --> 00:20:34.189]  [Spanish]
[00:20:34.189 --> 00:20:35.189]  [Spanish]
[00:20:35.189 --> 00:20:36.189]  [Spanish]
[00:20:36.189 --> 00:20:41.587]   Somehow, these large groups of migrants are informed about the place and time when the
[00:20:41.587 --> 00:20:53.189]  forklifts raise the barbed wire to cross in drops.
[00:20:53.166 --> 00:21:01.868]  Hundreds of thousands of military-age men from all over the Middle East, you name it, are mixed in with these people, pouring across giant sex trade rings.
[00:21:02.788 --> 00:21:03.908]  The list goes on and on.
[00:21:03.928 --> 00:21:05.628]  And there are, of course, hundreds of videos.
[00:21:06.128 --> 00:21:08.929]  Dozens come out a week where they go up and ask them, where are you going?
[00:21:09.429 --> 00:21:13.750]  And they tell the different sanctuary cities they're going to that are openly collapsing around us.
[00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.230]  Here's part of one of those reports.
[00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:17.530]  How you doing?
[00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.871]  Where are you coming from?
[00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:21.131]  Where are you from?
[00:21:23.953 --> 00:21:24.493]  Where are you from?
[00:21:25.494 --> 00:21:27.596]  Africa?
[00:21:28.757 --> 00:21:28.977]  Where?
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:32.721]  From where?
[00:21:32.741 --> 00:21:38.526]  Haiti, Modutoni, Senegal, where?
[00:21:38.686 --> 00:21:39.727]  Senegal, thank you.
[00:21:39.767 --> 00:21:40.288]  Where are you going?
[00:21:41.709 --> 00:21:43.570]  Where are you going?
[00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:45.272]  New York, California, where?
[00:21:49.724 --> 00:21:50.124]  Chicago.
[00:21:50.184 --> 00:21:50.724]  Chicago.
[00:21:50.984 --> 00:21:51.524]  Colorado.
[00:21:51.884 --> 00:21:52.565]  Colorado.
[00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:53.105]  Thank you.
[00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:54.025]  You, sir?
[00:21:55.285 --> 00:21:55.905]  Where are you from?
[00:21:55.925 --> 00:21:58.026]  Senegal.
[00:21:58.326 --> 00:22:01.266]  Where are you going, sir?
[00:22:01.986 --> 00:22:02.526]  New York.
[00:22:02.887 --> 00:22:03.247]  New York?
[00:22:03.507 --> 00:22:03.907]  Thank you.
[00:22:04.207 --> 00:22:04.547]  You, sir?
[00:22:05.307 --> 00:22:06.027]  Senegal.
[00:22:06.087 --> 00:22:06.747]  Where are you going?
[00:22:06.767 --> 00:22:08.448]  Philadelphia.
[00:22:08.648 --> 00:22:09.788]  Philadelphia.
[00:22:09.808 --> 00:22:10.148]  Thank you.
[00:22:10.188 --> 00:22:10.328]  You?
[00:22:10.388 --> 00:22:10.748]  Senegal.
[00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:12.548]  Where are you going?
[00:22:12.568 --> 00:22:14.169]  Biagra, Estonia.
[00:22:14.429 --> 00:22:14.969]  Thank you, sir.
[00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.129]  You?
[00:22:16.496 --> 00:22:17.477]  Where are you from?
[00:22:17.497 --> 00:22:18.557]  Senegal.
[00:22:18.698 --> 00:22:19.258]  Where are you going?
[00:22:19.278 --> 00:22:20.359]  Missouri.
[00:22:20.959 --> 00:22:21.159]  Where?
[00:22:21.179 --> 00:22:21.880]  Missouri.
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:22.781]  Missouri.
[00:22:22.881 --> 00:22:23.261]  Thank you.
[00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:23.661]  You, sir?
[00:22:23.681 --> 00:22:25.302]  I'm from Senegal.
[00:22:25.523 --> 00:22:26.383]  And where are you going, sir?
[00:22:27.384 --> 00:22:28.084]  Philadelphia.
[00:22:28.284 --> 00:22:28.785]  Thank you, sir.
[00:22:29.405 --> 00:22:29.786]  You, sir?
[00:22:30.366 --> 00:22:30.806]  Senegal.
[00:22:31.026 --> 00:22:31.667]  Where are you going?
[00:22:31.987 --> 00:22:32.287]  New York.
[00:22:32.608 --> 00:22:33.008]  Thank you.
[00:22:33.308 --> 00:22:33.488]  You?
[00:22:33.969 --> 00:22:34.369]  Senegal.

[00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:36.170]  New York.
[00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:36.971]  Thank you, sir.
[00:22:37.551 --> 00:22:37.951]  Senegal.
[00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:40.030]  You're young!
[00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:40.530]  You speak good English!
[00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:40.930]  How old are you?

[00:22:41.911 --> 00:22:43.031]  You speak good English!
[00:22:43.051 --> 00:22:43.692]  How old are you?

[00:22:44.092 --> 00:22:45.012]  You speak good English!

[00:22:58.257 --> 00:22:58.777]  You speak good English!
[00:22:58.797 --> 00:22:59.098]  How old are you?
[00:22:59.118 --> 00:22:59.378]  You're young!
[00:22:59.398 --> 00:22:59.838]  You speak good English!
[00:22:59.858 --> 00:23:00.298]  How old are you?
[00:23:00.318 --> 00:23:00.558]  You're young!
[00:23:00.578 --> 00:23:01.018]  You speak good English!
[00:23:01.038 --> 00:23:01.438]  How old are you?
[00:23:01.458 --> 00:23:01.799]  You're young!
[00:23:01.819 --> 00:23:02.379]  You speak good English!
[00:23:02.399 --> 00:23:02.739]  How old are you?
[00:23:03.336 --> 00:23:04.517]  Where are you from?
[00:23:04.617 --> 00:23:05.799]  From Ecuador.
[00:23:05.819 --> 00:23:06.840]  Where are you going?
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:07.661]  To New York.
[00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:08.222]  Thank you.
[00:23:08.262 --> 00:23:08.622]  And you, miss?
[00:23:08.642 --> 00:23:09.583]  I'm from Ecuador.
[00:23:09.603 --> 00:23:10.344]  Where are you going?
[00:23:10.765 --> 00:23:11.245]  To New York.
[00:23:11.646 --> 00:23:12.907]  Who are you coming with?
[00:23:13.247 --> 00:23:14.909]  With my husband, with my two children.
[00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:16.031]  Okay, excellent.
[00:23:16.231 --> 00:23:17.152]  Who are you coming with?
[00:23:17.634 --> 00:23:18.375]  My two kids.
[00:23:18.535 --> 00:23:19.495]  Where are you from?
[00:23:19.515 --> 00:23:20.016]  Guatemala.
[00:23:20.036 --> 00:23:20.656]  Guatemala?
[00:23:21.016 --> 00:23:22.577]  Where are you going, miss?
[00:23:22.617 --> 00:23:23.098]  I'm going to Texas.
[00:23:23.198 --> 00:23:24.519]  Very nice, thank you.
[00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:26.440]  And you, miss, who are you coming with?
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:26.860]  Ecuador.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.201]  I'm coming alone.
[00:23:28.221 --> 00:23:30.803]  And where are you going?
[00:23:31.023 --> 00:23:31.804]  New Jersey.
[00:23:31.944 --> 00:23:32.424]  Very nice.
[00:23:32.484 --> 00:23:32.804]  And you?
[00:23:32.824 --> 00:23:34.005]  Good afternoon.
[00:23:34.025 --> 00:23:34.566]  Good afternoon.
[00:23:34.606 --> 00:23:35.006]  Where are you from?
[00:23:35.026 --> 00:23:35.286]  Ecuador.
[00:23:35.546 --> 00:23:36.367]  Where are you going?
[00:23:36.427 --> 00:23:36.767]  New Jersey.
[00:23:38.367 --> 00:23:53.966]  [Spanish]
[00:23:53.966 --> 00:23:56.687]  There's hours of these videos a week.
[00:23:56.687 --> 00:23:58.127]  How you doing?
[00:23:58.127 --> 00:24:02.367]   Remember, the IMF and World Bank control almost every third world country through BlackRock
[00:24:02.367 --> 00:24:03.327]  and through their loans.
[00:24:04.292 --> 00:24:08.174]  For over two and a half years, they were completely shut down, starving to death.
[00:24:08.194 --> 00:24:11.656]  You notice how skinny many of these victims of the New World Order are.
[00:24:11.676 --> 00:24:21.234]   But once they get here, they're brought in and given voter IDs, driver's license, And are allowed to vote.
[00:24:21.314 --> 00:24:29.579]  Now happening in Chicago, New York City, San Francisco have passed laws for illegal aliens to vote and to be police officers.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:31.740]  Bombshell!
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:37.343]  Biden regime deploys heavy machinery, bulldozers to lift razor wire for massive mob of illegals at Rio Grande.
[00:24:39.345 --> 00:24:41.106]  From the great reporting of Border Hog.
[00:24:42.607 --> 00:24:48.230]  While they have distracted us from the war in the Middle East, a massive caravan is marching to storm our border.
[00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:48.650]  This is...
[00:24:49.761 --> 00:24:51.682]  Not a crisis, this is an invasion.
[00:24:54.862 --> 00:24:58.764]  Iranians, Syrians, on video, marching in, pouring into the country.
[00:24:58.784 --> 00:25:00.284]  Got video of that.
[00:25:02.405 --> 00:25:06.786]  The fine print of Democrats' plan to turn migrants, that's illegal aliens, into voters.
[00:25:06.946 --> 00:25:07.726]  Fox News.
[00:25:09.567 --> 00:25:11.587]  And it breaks down how they're doing it.
[00:25:12.908 --> 00:25:13.808]  How they're controlling it.
[00:25:16.661 --> 00:25:25.605]  If you think offering migrants luxury hotel rooms, free meals, laundry service, transportation, health care, and immigration lawyers is excessive, just wait until they can vote.
[00:25:26.085 --> 00:25:33.568]  Democrats are pushing to allow non-citizens to vote in local elections in New York, Boston, and other municipalities, as well as statewide in Connecticut.
[00:25:33.588 --> 00:25:38.090]  The number of migrants and illegal aliens pouring across the southern border hit a record high.
[00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.551]  And it goes on to lay it out.
[00:25:41.071 --> 00:25:50.557]   Now, New York Mayor Adams Has rhetoric where he's against it on the surface, but behind the scenes is pushing to completely legalize it, which it's already been done in many areas.
[00:25:53.258 --> 00:25:55.160]  Starting to figure out what's going on now.
[00:25:59.703 --> 00:26:08.730]  Israeli ministry in a concept paper proposes pushing everyone out of Gaza into Egypt and then having them be brought by the UN to the United States, Canada and Europe.
[00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.491]  Here's that article from Breitbart.
[00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.910]  Start to figure it out.
[00:26:15.811 --> 00:26:16.691]  Create the crisis.
[00:26:16.991 --> 00:26:18.611]  Offer the solution.
[00:26:21.512 --> 00:26:25.633]  There's a great awakening in the West of the New World Order by educated people of all colors.
[00:26:27.233 --> 00:26:32.054]  Because educated people across the board, Hispanic, black, white, there are people everywhere.
[00:26:32.814 --> 00:26:41.081]   Every store I go to, everywhere I go, I mean, I'd say 50% of the people coming up shaking my hand that are informed are black or hispanic or asian.
[00:26:41.621 --> 00:26:47.845]  But you see, that's the folks that have been here a couple generations and have had time to figure things out.
[00:26:49.145 --> 00:27:02.413]  People living hand to mouth from all over the world are a permanent underclass literally used for slave labor, sex slavery, and being a permanent underclass the globals control for voting.
[00:27:02.433 --> 00:27:06.355]  We're going to go to break and come back with the war news and it's serious.
[00:27:08.203 --> 00:27:15.106]  There are countless videos of the leaders of Hamas and others saying that they're going to destroy all Christians and all Jews and take over the world.
[00:27:15.847 --> 00:27:22.630]  So when I play Netanyahu saying we're going to exterminate everybody, including their farm animals, I'm going to show the other side.
[00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:24.451]  That's tribal warfare, folks.
[00:27:25.452 --> 00:27:28.413]  So he will either show one side or the other.
[00:27:28.633 --> 00:27:32.615]  I'm trying to show everybody this is out of control and we don't want to be part of this tribal warfare.
[00:27:32.935 --> 00:27:34.576]  You just have your tribal warfare over there.
[00:27:34.916 --> 00:27:36.037]  You keep us the hell out of it.
[00:27:37.898 --> 00:27:43.682]  But now it's being reported that there is a rebellion, a quote, Muslim uprisings, the headline across the U.S.
[00:27:43.722 --> 00:27:44.642]  against Biden.
[00:27:46.404 --> 00:27:47.724]  It's all going down.
[00:27:48.745 --> 00:27:50.446]  It's all happening right now.
[00:27:50.466 --> 00:27:55.990]  We're going to lay it all out here today, straight ahead on AlexJonesInfoWars.com.
[00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:57.351]  Have you shared that link today?
[00:27:58.703 --> 00:28:16.458]  Alright, to say it's a big deal that Turkey's Erdogan, who's been somewhat friendly to Israel overall, compared to other Arab countries, Muslim countries, coming out and saying we'll invade Israel over the weekend, as he spoke to millions of people at an outdoor rally, to say that's a bad thing and dangerous is an understatement.
[00:28:17.979 --> 00:28:26.566]  But Vladimir Putin, in a series of interviews and statements, has basically come out against Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:33.667]  So as I've been saying here since October 7th, Israel's not seen as the underdog anymore.
[00:28:34.869 --> 00:28:38.072]  Israel is seen as an extension of the West.
[00:28:40.375 --> 00:28:47.303]  And Vladimir Putin has now come out in a speech, we're going to play here for you in a moment, and said just that.
[00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:50.575]  So, this is about to turn into a regional war.
[00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:52.516]  We're going to have a big war in Ukraine.
[00:28:52.616 --> 00:28:54.117]  China's going to move into Taiwan.
[00:28:54.758 --> 00:28:56.299]  They're openly saying they're getting ready to.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.161]  And all hell's going to break loose.
[00:28:58.661 --> 00:29:04.826]  You add to that the head of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, saying, looks like we're going to have a depression, maybe worse than the Great Depression.
[00:29:05.606 --> 00:29:11.591]  Can you imagine what's going to happen to this country and the world in a global depression?
[00:29:11.971 --> 00:29:15.671]   of people at the start of the Great Depression lived in the countryside.
[00:29:15.671 --> 00:29:19.211]  And about half of them were self-sufficient.
[00:29:19.211 --> 00:29:27.809]   So 47% had a farm, had chickens, had cows, had goats, had sheep, and could feed themselves.
[00:29:27.809 --> 00:29:31.411]   And by the end of the Great Depression, none of the cows were basically left for sheep.
[00:29:31.411 --> 00:29:33.529]  They even had trouble restocking them.
[00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:36.891]   And they estimate seven million people starved to death during the Great Depression.
[00:29:36.891 --> 00:29:44.891]   We're now 90% urban, 10% rural, and less than half the rural people are self-sufficient.
[00:29:45.436 --> 00:29:51.461]  That's 5% self-sufficient versus 40 plus percent in the 1930s.
[00:29:53.162 --> 00:29:55.444]  Now you do the math on that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:55.904 --> 00:29:58.086]  We are sitting on top of a powder keg.
[00:29:59.181 --> 00:30:13.007]  And if all the rich Rothschilds and Rockefellers and Bill Gates of the world think when all this melts down they're going to bring in a cashless society and giant protein bug farms and that we're going to buy into their new system when they collapse the old system, they're crazy.
[00:30:13.927 --> 00:30:16.048]  But a lot of us are going to get destroyed in the process as well.
[00:30:16.528 --> 00:30:17.749]  This is dreadful.
[00:30:20.345 --> 00:30:22.767]  And war is the health of the state, has been said many times.
[00:30:23.368 --> 00:30:24.388]  War is the health of the state.
[00:30:25.229 --> 00:30:30.654]  And so, when all else fails, as Gerald Cilente says, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[00:30:31.915 --> 00:30:32.916]  And that's where we are.
[00:30:33.356 --> 00:30:34.517]  Collapsing borders.
[00:30:35.057 --> 00:30:36.098]  Massive crime.
[00:30:37.559 --> 00:30:38.901]  Deindustrialization.
[00:30:39.861 --> 00:30:42.003]  Half the public's on a bunch of different types of drugs.
[00:30:42.944 --> 00:30:43.845]  We're a cursed nation.
[00:30:44.405 --> 00:30:46.367]  The West is cursed because we turned our back on God.
[00:30:48.203 --> 00:30:52.685]  And now the Middle East is collapsing further and they're beginning to accelerate bringing them here.
[00:30:53.446 --> 00:31:00.349]  So they can be organized by the left into a brigade of political resistance to be activated when Soros wants to.
[00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:03.330]  So that's where we are ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:04.731 --> 00:31:08.613]  So the globalists can talk about attacking me and attacking my family and oh we're gonna get Jones.
[00:31:09.173 --> 00:31:12.675]  I'll quote Helter Skelter, I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you.
[00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:17.932]  You can take America down, you're going to take yourselves down, Bill Gates.
[00:31:18.613 --> 00:31:24.118]  Bill Gates can't go anywhere in public without being shouted at about being at Epstein's Island 20-something times that we know of.
[00:31:25.659 --> 00:31:28.121]  None of the New World Order can go anywhere now without being shouted down.
[00:31:28.181 --> 00:31:29.342]  People know who they are.
[00:31:30.083 --> 00:31:31.124]  We know what they've done.
[00:31:31.144 --> 00:31:32.685]  We understand it.
[00:31:34.347 --> 00:31:35.188]  Elon Musk is right.
[00:31:35.228 --> 00:31:36.469]  The Great Awakening is here.
[00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.213]  Here's Vladimir Putin coming out against Israel.
[00:31:41.233 --> 00:31:42.074]  This is a big deal.
[00:31:42.742 --> 00:32:02.534]  We also see that instead of punishing criminals and terrorists, unfortunately they started to take revenge based on the principle of the collective responsibility of the horrible events that are now unfolding in the Gaza Strip when hundreds of thousands of innocent people are being exterminated.
[00:32:02.814 --> 00:32:11.303]   People who have nowhere to go, nowhere to hide from the bombardments, from the shelling, cannot be Justified.
[00:32:11.503 --> 00:32:31.993]  When you look at the children covered in blood, at the dead children, deceased children, when you look at how the elderly women are suffering, how medic professionals are dying, of course it makes you clench your fist and it makes you cry.
[00:32:32.013 --> 00:32:34.314]  I cannot put it in any other way.
[00:32:34.394 --> 00:32:45.752]   Russia wants to build a fairer world for all the civilizations.
[00:32:45.907 --> 00:32:51.248]  We are not only one of the leaders of this subjective historical process, but I will tell you more.
[00:32:52.189 --> 00:32:53.729]  And everyone is aware of this.
[00:32:54.750 --> 00:33:04.353]  For our future, for the principles of the just world order, for the freedom of countries and nations, Russia is fighting for all of this on the battlefield.
[00:33:05.529 --> 00:33:13.871]  Russia is fighting consistently, losing our brothers in arms, losing our soldiers, our officers, our heroes.
[00:33:14.351 --> 00:33:15.431]  I will say that again.
[00:33:15.711 --> 00:33:28.654]  For the tragedies of the Palestinians, for the clashes in the Middle East, behind the conflict in Ukraine, behind all of this, behind many other conflicts in the world, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Syria, and so on and so forth.
[00:33:30.956 --> 00:33:35.140]  Ruling elites of the United States and their satellites are standing behind all of this.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.561]  It is obvious to everyone.
[00:33:36.641 --> 00:33:41.165]  They are the ones who are trying to build, to deploy their military bases.
[00:33:41.605 --> 00:33:45.729]  They are using every occasion to use the military force at all times.
[00:33:46.209 --> 00:33:49.072]  They are supplying weapons to the conflict zones.
[00:33:50.413 --> 00:33:54.357]  And they are supplying financial means, including to Ukraine and the Middle East.
[00:33:54.737 --> 00:33:58.040]  They are fanning the hatred in Ukraine and in the Middle East.
[00:33:59.747 --> 00:34:05.708]  And without having any accomplishments on the battlefields, they are trying to divide us from the inside.
[00:34:07.069 --> 00:34:09.709]  The Muslim-American revolt against Joe Biden has begun.
[00:34:09.729 --> 00:34:24.132]  Vladimir Putin, when you look at bloodied children, dead children, how women, old people suffer, how doctors die, and a clenched fist, and tears well up in your eyes, you can't say it any other way, but we shouldn't.
[00:34:24.692 --> 00:34:28.473]  We don't have the right to allow ourselves to be guided by emotions.
[00:34:29.209 --> 00:34:34.732]  You must clearly understand who is really behind the tragedy of the people of the Middle East and other regions of the world.
[00:34:35.332 --> 00:34:37.773]  Who organizes the deadly chaos and benefits from it.
[00:34:38.194 --> 00:34:41.155]  Today, this has become obvious and clear to everyone.
[00:34:43.737 --> 00:34:45.497]  The customers act openly and brazenly.
[00:34:46.738 --> 00:34:52.241]  It is the ruling elites of the United States and their satellites that are the main beneficiaries of global instability.
[00:34:54.502 --> 00:34:55.643]  And then he comes out against Israel.
[00:34:56.593 --> 00:35:01.857]  Switzerland mails iodine tablets to 5 million residents in case of nuclear disaster.
[00:35:01.877 --> 00:35:08.782]  When we've sold potassium iodide pills, the media calls us scammers.
[00:35:09.983 --> 00:35:10.843]  2020 flashback.
[00:35:10.883 --> 00:35:14.626]  Biden claims Trump will start world war with Iran.
[00:35:15.587 --> 00:35:16.287]  Cue that up for me.
[00:35:18.509 --> 00:35:19.269]  I love this graphic.
[00:35:19.689 --> 00:35:24.373]  For radio listeners, it shows a Muslim in the Muslim garb with a big beard and the nightgown.
[00:35:25.638 --> 00:35:28.139]  He comes and talks to the admissions guy at the desk in Europe.
[00:35:29.039 --> 00:35:31.080]  Welcome to Europe, the year 2000.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.281]  2010, there's three Muslims.
[00:35:32.881 --> 00:35:33.861]  They say, welcome to Europe.
[00:35:34.562 --> 00:35:40.864]  The next year, there's five Muslims, and there's a Muslim behind the counter that controls who gets in, which is the case in Europe.
[00:35:41.684 --> 00:35:46.146]  And by 2030, the white guy tries to get in, and they say, go away unfaithful.
[00:35:49.768 --> 00:35:50.628]  Absolutely.
[00:35:52.372 --> 00:36:00.800]  And again, you hear the tribal warfare talk of the Israeli leadership, saying we'll destroy all the Muslims, you know, kill them all and kill their farm animals.
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.322]  You're like, well, that doesn't sound very nice.
[00:36:03.023 --> 00:36:08.428]  Then I've got clip after clip of Hamas leader says it's not about land or just Palestine.
[00:36:08.468 --> 00:36:10.510]  The entire planet will be under our law.
[00:36:10.871 --> 00:36:12.993]  There'll be no Jews or Christian traitors.
[00:36:14.977 --> 00:36:18.139]  So see, the only way to win this game is not to play.
[00:36:18.399 --> 00:36:28.124]  Control our borders, keep it all out, stop funding Israel, and just say, hey, you're 3,000 year war killing each other, enjoy yourselves, we're not part of it.
[00:36:29.725 --> 00:36:32.166]  And nothing against the Muslims and the Jews, just damn it.
[00:36:33.627 --> 00:36:36.108]  Our country is literally collapsing.
[00:36:36.489 --> 00:36:42.752]  We can't send $20 billion to Israel and $800 billion to that idiot in Ukraine.
[00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:46.662]  And his frickin' Azog battalions that literally hail Hitler.
[00:36:46.902 --> 00:36:47.903]  Just give me a break.
[00:36:49.084 --> 00:36:52.005]  When the globalists want to call some innocent person like Trump a Nazi, they do it.
[00:36:52.025 --> 00:36:54.306]  When you got a real Nazi on your hands, it's okay.
[00:36:54.867 --> 00:36:55.607]  It's not okay.
[00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:07.554]  And then the Islamists in London have gone and dumped thousands of rats into a McDonald's because they see McDonald's as supporting Israel.
[00:37:08.354 --> 00:37:09.295]  I mean, what does that do?
[00:37:09.355 --> 00:37:11.696]  It's just all psychotic weirdness.
[00:37:13.188 --> 00:37:14.689]  And I've checked, this is a true story.
[00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:21.915]  Albert Einstein wrote in 1948 and referred to Zionists as criminals.
[00:37:23.496 --> 00:37:31.682]  And he said it's going to basically turn the world against Jews if we go to Palestine and take their property and kick them out into the West Bank and into the Gaza Strip.
[00:37:32.663 --> 00:37:38.267]  And again, I'm not even demonizing the Zionists.
[00:37:38.327 --> 00:37:40.049]  I'm just telling you what Albert Einstein said here.
[00:37:40.569 --> 00:37:41.270]  Pretty smart guy.
[00:37:42.585 --> 00:37:43.425]  There's his letter about it.
[00:37:44.226 --> 00:37:46.447]  He said British intelligence was behind it all, which they were.
[00:37:46.467 --> 00:37:50.229]  I saw a meme today on Twitter that I think says it all.
[00:37:50.729 --> 00:37:52.010]  For any illustrators, I'll describe it.
[00:37:53.411 --> 00:38:11.240]  It shows an old-fashioned, leg-driven sewing machine with the rainbow flag of the Pedos and the devil, big red devil, sitting there at the chair, showing the flag like Betsy Ross sewed the Continental original flag with 13 stars.
[00:38:13.951 --> 00:38:20.912]  That says we live in a world where Satan has stopped hiding and the world pretends not to see him.
[00:38:23.013 --> 00:38:24.553]  I think that says it all, doesn't it?
[00:38:25.653 --> 00:38:28.934]  A picture tells 10,000 words.
[00:38:32.815 --> 00:38:36.896]  Tony Lyons is a really smart fellow and the publisher of Sky Horse Publishing.
[00:38:38.896 --> 00:38:41.317]  And I'm not just having him on to talk about the Great Awakening coming up.
[00:38:41.357 --> 00:38:45.736]   I'm going to get his take on the world and Everything else is going on.
[00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:48.197]  About 30 minutes to the next hour.
[00:38:49.718 --> 00:38:58.400]  Then, we got a former high-level Army intelligence officer, Scott Bennett, joining us the third hour to cover the waterfront about what he thinks is happening next to the world.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.781]  He's been frighteningly accurate predicting things in the past.
[00:39:04.362 --> 00:39:06.883]  And then we'll continue on from there.
[00:39:07.003 --> 00:39:11.564]  But as bad as all this news is, we told you the Great Awakening's here, all the numbers show it.
[00:39:11.944 --> 00:39:14.085]  Populist anti-globalists are getting elected everywhere.
[00:39:15.848 --> 00:39:18.690]  To national and regional posts.
[00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:20.151]  They're the highest posts in the land.
[00:39:20.511 --> 00:39:21.992]  Presidencies, prime ministerships.
[00:39:24.534 --> 00:39:28.097]  Populist anti-globalists are winning by about a 2 to 1 margin.
[00:39:29.438 --> 00:39:32.980]  Now, the New World Order knows that, and so they've indicted a whole bunch of them.
[00:39:35.282 --> 00:39:40.145]  In Europe, in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia, and even in the Middle East.
[00:39:41.886 --> 00:39:45.369]  They're going after people that don't want to be part of the war.
[00:39:46.457 --> 00:40:01.201]  And I've been a big critic of Saudi Arabia and it is a monarchy, a hereditary dictatorship, but you saw Trump work with them and have them cut oil prices and have them get out of the way of the U.S.
[00:40:01.221 --> 00:40:11.944]  being dominant in oil and shift their money to peaceful projects, the 180, and you saw them try to remove the crown prince.
[00:40:12.484 --> 00:40:18.267]   So even there, They won't even meet with the Biden administration people.
[00:40:19.027 --> 00:40:21.169]  And they're openly critical on Saudi Arabian TV.
[00:40:21.229 --> 00:40:26.434]  I see the clips and talk about the corrupt deep state that seized America and how they want to work with America.
[00:40:27.014 --> 00:40:28.996]  So even Saudi Arabia, it's legitimate.
[00:40:29.296 --> 00:40:36.363]  I mean, it does not want to have a holy war and understands that if Islam tries to take the planet over, we're all just going to kill each other.
[00:40:37.307 --> 00:40:43.652]  And you know, that's what happens when you're fourth-generational royalty and understand that a war with what's left of the West is suicidal.
[00:40:44.293 --> 00:40:47.175]  But most of the other Muslim nations are not going along those lines.
[00:40:47.255 --> 00:40:47.896]  Not Iran.
[00:40:49.357 --> 00:40:50.017]  Not even Turkey.
[00:40:51.419 --> 00:40:53.240]  And Turkey's got a gigantic military.
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:54.661]  One of the biggest in Europe.
[00:40:54.681 --> 00:40:58.965]  They got nuclear weapons, so... It's a serious situation.
[00:40:58.985 --> 00:41:00.626]  There's really two parties.
[00:41:00.666 --> 00:41:03.889]  People that want to have a future and not destroy ourselves, and people that are crazy.
[00:41:04.952 --> 00:41:10.673]  And NATO and the people running our country are completely out of their minds by every yardstick.
[00:41:10.753 --> 00:41:15.454]  And like dominoes, the whole world is turning against America.
[00:41:15.694 --> 00:41:16.474]  And that's not good.
[00:41:16.634 --> 00:41:21.875]  Because just because we're hijacked by evil doesn't mean that we couldn't turn back to good.
[00:41:22.155 --> 00:41:34.703]   It doesn't mean having communist China and Russia and Turkey and now communists from Brazil In the driver's seat.
[00:41:35.623 --> 00:41:36.464]  That's where we are.
[00:41:37.424 --> 00:41:40.445]  And I'm doing my best here to really just lay this out.
[00:41:41.485 --> 00:41:42.605]  But it's all coming to an end.
[00:41:42.645 --> 00:41:44.065]  The big bubble's already popped.
[00:41:44.726 --> 00:41:45.986]  The economy is in shambles.
[00:41:46.586 --> 00:41:47.966]  It's becoming clearer by the day.
[00:41:50.287 --> 00:42:08.435]   And Katie barred the door when the public finally figures out that inflation that they've been trying to hide by putting water in the meat and extra air in the cereal and the chip packages and Adulterating the foods and lowering their quality, that can't cover it up anymore.
[00:42:08.455 --> 00:42:12.317]  So that's why a Big Mac a week ago was $5 and now it's $18.50.
[00:42:12.877 --> 00:42:16.098]  And to me, that is a bellwether.
[00:42:16.158 --> 00:42:18.979]  That is a canary in the coal mine.
[00:42:19.399 --> 00:42:20.499]  $18 for a crappy Big Mac.
[00:42:20.539 --> 00:42:23.140]  You have to pay me $100 to eat one.
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.141]  But that's where a lot of average people go eat.
[00:42:26.161 --> 00:42:27.101]  They think they're getting the value.
[00:42:27.761 --> 00:42:32.203]  And because McDonald's couldn't make money anymore because of the inflation.
[00:42:33.865 --> 00:42:47.337]  But they try to keep prices low to keep market dominance, and when McDonald's almost triples, or more than triples, the cost of their main hamburger... What does that tell you?
[00:42:48.278 --> 00:42:49.339]  That's how inflation works.
[00:42:49.459 --> 00:42:55.284]  It creeps up, it accelerates some, country's trying to manipulate it back down, and then it just jumps.
[00:42:56.645 --> 00:42:59.788]  And when it makes that first big jump, it's usually a doubling.
[00:43:00.882 --> 00:43:03.884]  We're seeing more, and then all of a sudden it jumps again, it's a quadrupling.
[00:43:05.366 --> 00:43:08.608]  And then it'll jump 10 times on average more after the quadrupling.
[00:43:10.169 --> 00:43:21.758]  So you wake up one day and gas is $4 a gallon, and then you wake up a week later, it's $10 a gallon, and then that causes a depression, because nobody can pay for the fuel, and then it cascades.
[00:43:22.499 --> 00:43:29.945]  So despite all the depression in the real economy, with the interest rates going up, inflation's still spiking.
[00:43:31.223 --> 00:43:32.465]  That is stagflation.
[00:43:33.246 --> 00:43:37.571]  And that is the worst economic prognosis you can get.
[00:43:37.591 --> 00:43:41.136]  So you're gonna have to choose in this fight.
[00:43:42.699 --> 00:43:43.579]  What you're going to support.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:44.980]  I would support your family.
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:45.820]  I'd support your health.
[00:43:46.361 --> 00:43:48.822]  And I would support people that are standing up against the evil.
[00:43:48.862 --> 00:43:53.084]  And I would support media that understands what's going on that the enemy wants silenced.
[00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:54.884]  But I know it's going to get rough.
[00:43:55.485 --> 00:43:56.245]  It's already horrible.
[00:43:56.525 --> 00:43:57.926]  And the bottom is now dropping out.
[00:43:58.186 --> 00:43:59.507]  The bubble has begun to collapse.
[00:43:59.947 --> 00:44:02.968]  And it's going to go faster and faster and faster.
[00:44:03.048 --> 00:44:04.489]  And there's no putting it back.
[00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:10.890]  In the past, the bubble was big and it would have been devastating if it popped, but it was a fraud, so we said it's a damn if you, damn if you don't.
[00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:17.071]  As the bubble gets bigger, it's going to be more dangerous when it pops, but nobody really wants it to pop because nobody wants to have the pain now.
[00:44:17.091 --> 00:44:21.072]  If it had popped in the year 2005, it would have been terrible.
[00:44:21.852 --> 00:44:23.153]  2010 would have been horrible.
[00:44:23.173 --> 00:44:24.833]  2016 would have been terrible.
[00:44:25.673 --> 00:44:29.174]  It's doubled in size since Biden got in less than three years ago.
[00:44:31.667 --> 00:44:32.067]  Doubled!
[00:44:32.587 --> 00:44:35.208]  And now it's deflating.
[00:44:35.969 --> 00:44:44.392]  They're trying to inflate it and give the big banks and themselves unlimited money while they raise interest rates so you don't get money, hoping by depressing you, it'll hide their inflation.
[00:44:45.213 --> 00:44:47.073]  That is the two-tiered system.
[00:44:48.354 --> 00:44:54.817]  And I'm trying to just boil down and dumb down the economics of this, not because you're dumb, but because it's so hard to even break down.
[00:44:54.877 --> 00:45:00.459]  But this never works, it's not working, and it's going to be explosive.
[00:45:02.059 --> 00:45:15.850]  So if I was you, most of our audience is informed, but if you're new listeners, I would go get a revolver if it's your first gun, and I would get a .410 shotgun.
[00:45:16.771 --> 00:45:20.134]  Twelve gauges don't kick, but people that don't shoot guns seem to think they kick.
[00:45:20.334 --> 00:45:21.475]  You don't know how to put it in your shoulder.
[00:45:21.535 --> 00:45:30.302]  So I would go out and get some firearms training on a semi-automatic .410 shotgun, and I would get a revolver .357 Magnum.
[00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:33.051]  Right now.
[00:45:33.694 --> 00:45:35.762]  And I would go learn how to shoot that right now.
[00:45:36.404 --> 00:45:37.709]  And I would have water filtration.
[00:45:38.672 --> 00:45:42.693]  And I would inform your neighbors and friends and family about what's going down, so they'll listen to you when it collapses.
[00:45:42.953 --> 00:45:43.673]  They won't listen now.
[00:45:44.273 --> 00:45:45.373]  And I would get storable food.
[00:45:45.693 --> 00:45:49.974]  We got the best storable food there is, ready to ship to you, three-month, six-month, year's supplies.
[00:45:50.054 --> 00:45:51.435]  And yeah, it funds our operation.
[00:45:51.475 --> 00:45:52.695]  We got the biggest, best company.
[00:45:53.115 --> 00:45:54.815]  We've had them as a sponsor for 14 years.
[00:45:54.835 --> 00:45:55.896]  They've been around 16 years.
[00:45:56.576 --> 00:45:59.116]  And they just have the best prices and best quality, so they became dominant.
[00:45:59.756 --> 00:46:01.677]  Their entire catalog's at infowarestore.com.
[00:46:03.131 --> 00:46:06.472]  They got giant warehouses across the country, and they got really high quality food.
[00:46:06.492 --> 00:46:07.492]  That's where I get my storable food.
[00:46:07.512 --> 00:46:10.433]  I would go to InfoWareStore.com right now, and I would get storable food.
[00:46:11.873 --> 00:46:12.613]  That's symbiotic.
[00:46:12.633 --> 00:46:19.215]  You get a great deal on storable food, you get prepared, you put your money in now, so as inflation expands, you beat inflation by doing that.
[00:46:20.195 --> 00:46:24.796]  I told people three years ago, buy a bunch of food, it's gonna double in price the next couple years.
[00:46:24.976 --> 00:46:25.536]  It's doubled.
[00:46:26.476 --> 00:46:27.656]  A carton of milk's doubled.
[00:46:28.617 --> 00:46:29.797]  A carton of eggs doubled.
[00:46:34.611 --> 00:46:35.992]  A jar of peanut butter is double.
[00:46:37.773 --> 00:46:39.034]  A bag of rice is triple.
[00:46:40.615 --> 00:46:43.918]  Well, they still haven't passed on that because they bought their food in advance.
[00:46:44.718 --> 00:46:48.020]  But I would go to InfoWarsware.com and I get trouble food and I get a water filtration system.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.262]  We got the highest rated out there at the lowest price you're going to find.
[00:46:50.742 --> 00:46:52.303]  That also keeps the broadcast on the air.
[00:46:52.844 --> 00:46:55.986]  But regardless, get your soul right with God.
[00:46:56.086 --> 00:46:58.548]  That's the most important thing and do it now.
[00:47:00.632 --> 00:47:11.898]  And keep the tip of the spear on the air during these serious times, because we'll be able, when they launch horrible operations, to expose them, in many cases, beat them, or weaken their attack, at least.
[00:47:12.518 --> 00:47:13.779]  Look at the success we've had together.
[00:47:14.299 --> 00:47:17.440]  So our mission is more critical than ever, so please pray for the broadcast.
[00:47:17.481 --> 00:47:23.724]  But regardless, go to mfoolwarestore.com and get Colloidal Silver.
[00:47:23.744 --> 00:47:25.845]  We got the best out there at the lowest price you're going to find.
[00:47:26.625 --> 00:47:27.205]  Silver Bullet.
[00:47:27.305 --> 00:47:27.986]  Everybody needs that.
[00:47:28.006 --> 00:47:28.626]  It's a staple.
[00:47:28.926 --> 00:47:29.707]  It's a must-have.

[00:47:31.385 --> 00:47:32.506]  And boost your immune system.

[00:48:03.905 --> 00:48:07.947]  This is getting very, very dangerous, very, very quickly.

[00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:33.470]  Stay with us.
[00:48:33.559 --> 00:48:36.721]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:48:37.121 --> 00:48:41.584]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:48:42.224 --> 00:48:44.345]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:48:44.665 --> 00:48:52.650]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.

[00:48:55.091 --> 00:48:58.996]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:48:59.476 --> 00:49:05.804]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller and this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[00:49:30.249 --> 00:49:40.528]   And it's time for humanity to stand up and the info war and say I don't know what's gonna happen
[00:49:40.528 --> 00:49:44.342]   at the end of this but you wanna You better believe you got one!
[00:49:44.182 --> 00:49:51.182]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:49:51.182 --> 00:49:58.182]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here.
[00:49:58.182 --> 00:50:01.182]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here.
[00:50:01.489 --> 00:50:07.574]  This is the first time you are hearing from me since my speech incarceration.
[00:50:08.434 --> 00:50:12.317]  And I really don't want to get into what's going on here on the inside.
[00:50:12.938 --> 00:50:15.560]  I'm much more concerned about what's going on out there.
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:21.824]  But I will say, I am finally out of my solitary confinement for a week.
[00:50:23.125 --> 00:50:26.508]  And I'm extremely blessed because your prayers have come through.
[00:50:27.302 --> 00:50:45.973]   Some friends helped me get through it with some conversations as well as getting me a digital radio so I had some reach with the outside world and I was also able to follow a bit of the news via some talk shows And we have a TV here that I'm able to tune into on the FM dial as well.
[00:50:46.233 --> 00:50:48.394]  And they have newscasts up as well.
[00:50:48.414 --> 00:50:57.937]  And of course, I could sit here and talk about all the Biden crime family, corruption that we've seen, the media that is obsessed with war, propaganda, and all the regular stuff.
[00:50:58.097 --> 00:51:02.538]  But that's not what I want to bring to this message today.
[00:51:03.738 --> 00:51:09.060]  I've just got done reading some of the mail that has been sent to me.
[00:51:09.679 --> 00:51:15.879]   and to try to express how important it is or what it means to me would simply be impossible.
[00:51:15.879 --> 00:51:23.960]   I do somehow plan to show you how grateful I am for that when I do get out of here, but I've got to say,
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:26.198]  my shirt has grown.
[00:51:26.198 --> 00:51:32.858]   I have to wear a XXL shirt now because my heart has grown so much from your fan mail.
[00:51:32.858 --> 00:51:39.398]   And also I'm now wearing XXL pants because, well, I'll just leave that up for your interpretation.
[00:51:39.398 --> 00:51:43.599]   But seriously, every single letter that's sent to me, I read every word.
[00:51:43.629 --> 00:51:45.610]  Some of them I read twice or three times.
[00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:48.471]  I can't tell you how much they mean to me.
[00:51:49.011 --> 00:51:58.135]  And I'm going to re-share the information here on this Twitter account so that you can continue to send me the fan mail and uplift me.
[00:51:58.575 --> 00:52:00.356]  When I'm tired, I get energy.
[00:52:01.584 --> 00:52:04.546]  When I'm hungry, I feel I'm fed.
[00:52:05.347 --> 00:52:06.948]  And it's all thanks to your letters.
[00:52:07.668 --> 00:52:11.130]  When you write them, you may not think I read them or they mean much to me.
[00:52:11.611 --> 00:52:17.535]  But trust me, I read them and they mean more than you could even imagine.
[00:52:18.439 --> 00:52:24.802]  Now again, I don't want to get too much into what's going on here, but I have been helped along the way by some friendlies.
[00:52:24.962 --> 00:52:26.322]  Today is my first day out.
[00:52:27.043 --> 00:52:29.984]  And so now my life on the outside, as it would seem, begins.
[00:52:30.004 --> 00:52:33.385]  Of course, that being hyperbolic, since I'm still on the inside.
[00:52:33.845 --> 00:52:40.968]  But when you spend seven days in solitary, getting out and into a jail and being able to move feels like the outside.
[00:52:41.008 --> 00:52:41.949]  It was bitter cold today.
[00:52:41.969 --> 00:52:42.489]  It was sunny.
[00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:44.850]  This call is from a federal prison.
[00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:50.493]  It was sunny the entire time I was in, and then of course as soon as I get out it becomes rainy and freezing.
[00:52:50.573 --> 00:52:58.619]  But let me tell ya, the 40 degrees, wind and rain couldn't have felt any more refreshing than it did when I stepped out today.
[00:52:59.059 --> 00:53:02.341]  Probably just as refreshing as the sun would have felt.
[00:53:04.262 --> 00:53:06.624]  But, we will re-share the information.
[00:53:06.684 --> 00:53:07.884]  I hope you keep the mail coming.
[00:53:07.904 --> 00:53:11.807]  They had to bring a wheelbarrow in for me just to receive it.
[00:53:12.107 --> 00:53:14.769]  I'm being facetious, but that was the joke the guards were making.
[00:53:16.124 --> 00:53:20.590]  So, my life on the outside of the inside begins today.
[00:53:21.572 --> 00:53:25.016]  Once again, I cannot thank you all enough for your letters.
[00:53:25.176 --> 00:53:29.683]  I'm not sure everything that's going on out there, but hopefully it's encouraging.
[00:53:30.419 --> 00:53:40.125]  Hopefully there's some good news and maybe I'll be able to get a little more informed now that I'm outside and have a little more access to news, television, and this phone call.
[00:53:40.185 --> 00:53:48.610]  And even though my time on the phone will be limited, I will be using it efficiently to try to reach out and send as many messages to you as possible.
[00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:52.674]  I do hope to pull the impossible and maybe something that's never been done before.
[00:53:53.234 --> 00:53:56.558]  Hosting a radio show from a federal prison.
[00:53:56.998 --> 00:54:00.662]  But we'll work on that as I learn the flow of my life now on the outside.
[00:54:01.183 --> 00:54:02.284]  The countdown has begun.
[00:54:02.825 --> 00:54:03.866]  Your prayers mean everything.
[00:54:04.537 --> 00:54:06.298]  Your letters mean more than you can ever imagine.
[00:54:06.318 --> 00:54:19.763]  I'm eternally grateful, and I cannot wait until the day I return to being live on air with you, my friends, my family, and my fellow Patriots.
[00:54:20.283 --> 00:54:37.002]  Godspeed and God bless.
[00:54:37.002 --> 00:54:47.002]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:54:38.772 --> 00:54:46.637]  He started it back in 1997, founded it officially in its latest incarnation in 2006, SkyhorsePublishing.com.
[00:54:47.377 --> 00:54:53.201]  And I want to pick his brain about the world, what's happening today, not just talk about my new book, The Great Awakening.
[00:54:55.011 --> 00:54:58.072]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the next great renaissance.
[00:54:58.112 --> 00:55:04.134]  I want to get his view, just in general, about what a crazy world we're in, but also we'll show some of these on air.
[00:55:05.834 --> 00:55:10.275]  Elon Musk declares the Great Awakening from Woke has happened.
[00:55:11.636 --> 00:55:14.997]  The Great Awakening from Woke has happened.
[00:55:16.257 --> 00:55:21.158]  And going through the tweets here, he says the Great Awakening from Woke has happened.
[00:55:21.198 --> 00:55:23.019]  This is good for civilization.
[00:55:24.324 --> 00:55:25.405]  It's a bellwether.
[00:55:26.685 --> 00:55:28.346]  The bellwether has sounded.
[00:55:29.527 --> 00:55:31.528]  The word cis is a heterosexual slur.
[00:55:31.708 --> 00:55:33.008]  Shame on anyone that uses it.
[00:55:33.429 --> 00:55:34.869]  Yeah, obviously a slur.
[00:55:34.889 --> 00:55:43.054]  And he goes on to say that woke means your campaign is nothing more than clickbait.
[00:55:43.994 --> 00:55:46.395]  And that it's all the tyranny of the mind.
[00:55:47.136 --> 00:55:53.559]  Elon Musk says the woke mind virus is arguably one of the biggest threats to modern civilization.
[00:55:54.847 --> 00:55:56.548]  So, the book's called The Great Awakening.
[00:55:56.568 --> 00:56:00.649]  We could have called it The Great Awakening, which is a take on Woke.
[00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:04.571]  But certainly, no one can deny The Great Awakening is here.
[00:56:04.591 --> 00:56:09.492]  We got the great Mickey Willis with his film, The Great Awakening.
[00:56:09.533 --> 00:56:10.733]  We've had these throughout history.
[00:56:11.073 --> 00:56:12.914]  We're definitely at that crossroads now.
[00:56:13.634 --> 00:56:15.155]  So, Tony Lyons, thank you for joining us.
[00:56:16.975 --> 00:56:18.056]  Thanks so much for having me, Alex.
[00:56:19.079 --> 00:56:19.959]  Where do you want to start?
[00:56:19.979 --> 00:56:20.939]  I mean, what's your view?
[00:56:20.999 --> 00:56:22.240]  Because you're a smart guy.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.120]  We talk all the time.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:27.921]  I've interviewed you many times that I see on other shows about how would you describe the state of the world right now?
[00:56:27.961 --> 00:56:31.401]  We've got the Great Reset, the New World Order coming out, trying to take over.
[00:56:31.421 --> 00:56:32.702]  And then we also have the Great Awakening.
[00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:33.522]  What's the counter to it?
[00:56:35.502 --> 00:56:40.983]  Yeah, I mean, I want to start with the fact that, you know, I'm proud to have published this book.
[00:56:41.883 --> 00:56:45.824]  And I think readers, you know, viewers ought to really think about reading this book.
[00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:52.926]  That you are clearly the most persecuted and vilified person in the United States.
[00:56:52.946 --> 00:56:58.748]  You know, over these past few years, there's nobody who's endured what you've gone through.
[00:56:59.802 --> 00:57:01.763]  And, you know, you don't work for anybody.
[00:57:02.043 --> 00:57:04.505]  You're not, you know, paid by anybody.
[00:57:04.945 --> 00:57:09.508]  So, you know, you can really be trusted to say what you believe.
[00:57:10.088 --> 00:57:21.495]  And that's so rare in this world because almost everybody is conflicted in some way, you know, has some sort of conflict of interest that makes it hard for them to tell the truth.
[00:57:21.975 --> 00:57:30.119]  So I think that this is a really important book for people to read, that people ought to be able to read anything they want in this country.
[00:57:30.599 --> 00:57:33.861]  And you know, that's the main thing that I'm here to say, but I'm happy to talk about anything.
[00:57:34.775 --> 00:57:41.378]  Well, we got some of the great reviews, but the last book was excellent, The Great Reset and the War for the World, but it's about half as long.
[00:57:41.458 --> 00:57:44.339]  This one took four, five times longer to write.
[00:57:44.359 --> 00:57:47.420]  It was up like 600, 700 pages.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.321]  We had to cut some.
[00:57:49.101 --> 00:57:56.044]  You guys and your research team of lawyers and more checked everything, so that took a lot of time going through everything I said, every word I said.
[00:57:56.664 --> 00:58:04.315]  I mean, this book doesn't just cover the enemy operations, which it does, more than half of it, but the other 40% is solutions, an alternative to that.
[00:58:04.635 --> 00:58:05.897]  What's your take on the book?
[00:58:09.915 --> 00:58:13.719]  Is that, you know, this is incredibly thought-provoking.
[00:58:14.099 --> 00:58:23.089]  That, you know, there's been this sort of globalist coup all around the world, and you outline how it's falling apart.
[00:58:23.609 --> 00:58:30.036]  That, you know, that all the money and all the power in the world hasn't been able to stifle freedom.
[00:58:30.736 --> 00:58:34.619]  And, you know, those blurbs on the back are just spectacular blurbs.
[00:58:34.639 --> 00:58:49.689]  I mean, I would like to read some of them, but it's so important that we have people in this country who are able to think for themselves, decide for themselves what they want to do, what they want to think, what they want to read, what they want to put in their bodies.
[00:58:50.369 --> 00:58:57.477]  And, you know, this is the kind of book that, you know, people will say is dangerous, you know, that it's dangerous for them to read.
[00:58:57.857 --> 00:58:59.259]  But who is it dangerous to?
[00:58:59.559 --> 00:59:01.381]  You know, it's dangerous to the globalists.
[00:59:01.822 --> 00:59:04.184]  It's dangerous to the corrupt public officials.
[00:59:04.685 --> 00:59:09.510]  So, you know, look at what some of the people who gave blurbs of this book have written.
[00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:19.136]  So they said, Alex Jones is often mocked for his flamboyance, but the truth is he's been far better as a guide to reality in recent years.
[00:59:19.477 --> 00:59:28.423]  In other words, a far better journalist than anybody at NBC News, and he could have gone on to say anybody in the mainstream media, and that's from Tucker Carlson.
[00:59:28.883 --> 00:59:35.467]  And you have, you know, great blurbs from Bill Maher, from Joe Rogan, Steve Bannon, Mickey Willis, who you mentioned.
[00:59:35.888 --> 00:59:38.789]  So, you know, this is an important book for people to read.
[00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:44.153]  And, you know, George Orwell has a great quote, and it's actually in the book.
[00:59:44.513 --> 00:59:50.357]  And it's, in the time of deceit, the truth, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:59:50.777 --> 00:59:52.858]  George Orwell said that, you know, 70, 80 years ago.
[00:59:54.543 --> 00:59:59.764]  And, you know, like I said before, you tell the truth and you have no reason to hold back.
[01:00:00.044 --> 01:00:07.906]  And people should read this book, they should question the media that they've been inundated with, and they should start to open their eyes.
[01:00:07.946 --> 01:00:09.286]  And that's what this book is about.
[01:00:09.346 --> 01:00:11.006]  It's about a great awakening.
[01:00:12.547 --> 01:00:16.568]  Well, as Elon Musk said, the great awakening from wokeism is good for civilization.
[01:00:17.068 --> 01:00:19.614]   He just said that Last night.
[01:00:20.574 --> 01:00:22.356]  And he sees everywhere the Great Awakening.
[01:00:22.396 --> 01:00:29.462]  And I think as people see that freedom is popular, and it's going to let us survive nuclear war and not have nuclear war, more people are coming over to it.
[01:00:29.482 --> 01:00:32.825]  I mean, I, you tune into Bill Maher now, he says the deep state's running everything.
[01:00:32.845 --> 01:00:35.648]  He always sounds like Tucker Carlson or Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.728 --> 01:00:39.671]  So, Carlson's getting super hardcore, Rogan's getting more hardcore.
[01:00:40.972 --> 01:00:44.535]  Those are bellwethers of the fact that the public is not buying this.
[01:00:45.981 --> 01:00:50.981]   populace being elected at record numbers all over the world, anti-globalist, that's got
[01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:51.981]  to really scare the enemy.
[01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.740]  The problem is the enemy is going to strike back.
[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:56.580]  That's why the Info War is so important right now.
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:04.301]   Yeah, I mean, you know, you see all around the world, things are happening quickly.
[01:01:04.771 --> 01:01:14.376]  And if we're not, you know, sort of able to see clearly what's going on and able to get alternative points of view, then we're just lost.
[01:01:14.877 --> 01:01:17.158]  And, you know, we see that in the Ukraine war.
[01:01:17.558 --> 01:01:20.000]  People have no idea what we're fighting for there.
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:40.487]   You know, Biden has no plan for the future, no peace deal on the table, you know, so You know, the problem that we face all around is that people want to be involved in something, and they get all of this disinformation from the government, from their politicians, from the big corporations, and they don't know what to do.
[01:01:40.567 --> 01:01:47.631]  So they go out in the streets with Ukrainian flags or Palestinian flags, and they don't really know what it's all about.
[01:01:47.731 --> 01:01:50.753]  They're just being told what to do or what to think.
[01:01:52.481 --> 01:01:54.162]  I got a bunch of the reviews here.
[01:01:54.202 --> 01:01:55.282]  It's five-star reviews.
[01:01:55.322 --> 01:01:56.723]  Do you have those in front of you, Tony?
[01:01:58.164 --> 01:01:59.564]  I don't actually have those in front of me, no.
[01:02:00.024 --> 01:02:03.126]  I think I'm going to read some of these on air and get your takes to them.
[01:02:03.146 --> 01:02:06.067]  This is Lee Ash.
[01:02:08.328 --> 01:02:10.369]  Says, talk about connecting the dots.
[01:02:10.489 --> 01:02:11.790]  We have witness crazy.
[01:02:13.331 --> 01:02:16.313]  Making history behavior and events for a while now.
[01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:29.384]  Trying desperately to make sense of it all, Alex Jones is the master of consuming, digesting, then presenting clear and concise interpretation of all of this that confounds.
[01:02:29.965 --> 01:02:37.972]   I will do whatever I can to support and encourage the man to share his revelations so that we may Claim them as our own.
[01:02:38.012 --> 01:02:39.052]  Very nice thing written.
[01:02:40.113 --> 01:02:41.053]  We've got another.
[01:02:41.113 --> 01:02:43.415]  Paul said, required reading for the world.
[01:02:43.455 --> 01:02:47.497]  This book needs to become required reading for everyone on the planet ages 15 and up.
[01:02:47.917 --> 01:02:50.439]  Understand the depths of fascism, communism, Marxism.
[01:02:50.839 --> 01:02:55.001]  We're currently rapidly transforming into globally on purpose.
[01:02:55.562 --> 01:03:01.085]  Bravo to Jones and company for compiling this necessary evil.
[01:03:02.574 --> 01:03:03.275]  Then it goes on.
[01:03:03.335 --> 01:03:05.697]  Here's one from Very Informative.
[01:03:06.197 --> 01:03:07.078]  This is from MAGA.
[01:03:08.158 --> 01:03:11.501]  Some of the most important eye-opening info money can buy.
[01:03:12.082 --> 01:03:13.723]  And again, it will keep the broadcast on air.
[01:03:13.743 --> 01:03:14.924]  It's also a fundraiser.
[01:03:14.944 --> 01:03:17.766]  There's another one, a must-read from Oh Monkey.
[01:03:17.786 --> 01:03:23.551]  It says, for all those who want to understand this crazy time, here's another one from Judy.
[01:03:23.571 --> 01:03:26.173]  An amazing boom.
[01:03:27.174 --> 01:03:28.455]  Can't sing its praises enough.
[01:03:29.255 --> 01:03:29.916]  Wow, what a book.
[01:03:31.081 --> 01:03:31.942]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:03:31.962 --> 01:03:34.023]  There's a bunch of others, but it's an important book.
[01:03:34.283 --> 01:03:35.144]  Will it save the world?
[01:03:35.224 --> 01:03:35.424]  No.
[01:03:35.924 --> 01:03:39.406]  But it's one more piece in the puzzle to save the world with God's help.
[01:03:39.867 --> 01:03:41.027]  Tony Lyons is our guest.
[01:03:41.347 --> 01:03:43.269]  He'll come back and talk about world events straight ahead.
[01:03:43.289 --> 01:03:43.689]  Stay with us.
[01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:47.952]  So it's important to talk about what the Great Awakening is.
[01:03:49.532 --> 01:03:52.895]  It's important to define what we're promoting, what humanity wants.
[01:03:54.031 --> 01:03:55.632]  America 2.0, the Renaissance.
[01:03:55.652 --> 01:04:04.274]  We've not been perfect, but compared to the rest of the world, we're the place where you got due process and private property and the right to travel and a common-born person was just as important as a king.
[01:04:06.455 --> 01:04:07.776]  We were against elitism.
[01:04:07.836 --> 01:04:13.117]  We were for a meritocracy of what the people stood for, and that's what the Great Awakening is about.
[01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:15.558]  It's also about realizing it's a spiritual battle.
[01:04:15.998 --> 01:04:17.239]  It's about finding God.
[01:04:18.462 --> 01:04:20.383]  And it's not about going to some fake church.
[01:04:20.463 --> 01:04:24.166]  It's about realizing this is, at the end of the day, about good versus evil.
[01:04:25.667 --> 01:04:30.530]  We've got Tony Lyons, the publisher of Sky Horse, that has been a big publisher for a long time.
[01:04:30.550 --> 01:04:36.895]  But man, you are just dominating by putting out the books that are censored, putting out the information.
[01:04:37.675 --> 01:04:40.237]  I mean, I'm sure you saw it before you published our last book.
[01:04:41.338 --> 01:05:00.084]   One of the top publishers in the country, one of the top groups came to me and said, We want to put out a book about Alex Jones and they fired the famous agent and they fired more people and put articles everywhere about it and the publisher then gave the promotional information
[01:05:01.047 --> 01:05:05.311]  About Alex Jones and the Real History of the World, I think was the headline for the book, to kill it.
[01:05:05.371 --> 01:05:13.237]  I mean, that's how important it is for them to not just burn books, it's more important to keep them from ever getting published.
[01:05:13.297 --> 01:05:24.827]  And the left misrepresents that the right wing's burning books, when all they've been doing is saying, don't give sexually explicit, porno, pedophile cartoon books to middle schoolers.
[01:05:25.819 --> 01:05:27.741]  People have no idea how much censorship there is in this country now.
[01:05:27.561 --> 01:05:31.700]   Because the left's like, "Oh, we're for free speech," while they're the ones really driving
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:34.280]  the control.
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:38.000]   People have no idea how much censorship there is in this country now.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.760]   I mean, when a book like this comes out, I mean, when your last book came out, The Great
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:49.681]   Reset, you know, it sold more copies in the first week than any other book in the country,
[01:05:49.681 --> 01:05:51.920]  but it didn't make it onto any bestseller lists.
[01:05:52.258 --> 01:05:55.060]  It was not in any newspaper or magazines.
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.921]  There were no write-ups anywhere.
[01:05:57.941 --> 01:06:01.102]  It just got totally stifled.
[01:06:01.162 --> 01:06:03.983]  I mean, there was a total media blackout.
[01:06:04.424 --> 01:06:09.566]  So the bestselling book in the country for the week, and nobody talks about it, nobody writes about it.
[01:06:09.926 --> 01:06:11.687]  So that's what's really happening.
[01:06:11.727 --> 01:06:25.767]   I mean, the censorship is so broad, and yet, like you say, the left wants to tell people that there's this censorship of things like the right to choose your gender.
[01:06:26.505 --> 01:06:36.852]  You know, in a small town, in some library, where all the people there disagree with that kind of writing being put in the hands of young children.
[01:06:37.372 --> 01:06:49.801]  You know, which I think is perfectly legitimate, versus the censorship of ideas, versus the censorship of your right to believe, to say, to practice whatever you want to practice.
[01:06:49.841 --> 01:06:52.622]  Well, yeah, the real censorship is stopping books from being published.
[01:06:52.642 --> 01:07:00.007]   We're not saying censor, you know, the These terrible books that are on the verge of being illegal, promoting pedophilia.
[01:07:00.347 --> 01:07:04.449]  We're just saying, you're not going to put it as required reading or force it on our children.
[01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:12.554]  That's completely different than the left going around killing news organizations, killing publishers, killing books, being printed so adults can read them.
[01:07:12.814 --> 01:07:14.195]  That's real censorship.
[01:07:15.416 --> 01:07:15.636]  Right.
[01:07:15.736 --> 01:07:24.534]   I mean, I mean, grownups in this country, in a democracy, are perfectly able, perfectly capable of deciding what they
[01:07:24.534 --> 01:07:31.085]   believe and what they need is access to accurate information and then they decide what that
[01:07:31.085 --> 01:07:36.925]   information means whether they believe it, whether they think that it's valid. You know we don't need
[01:07:36.925 --> 01:07:46.605]   the government or some big corporation to tell us what the truth is. Let's talk about the book. I
[01:07:46.605 --> 01:07:50.275]   mean I know there's two proofreaders that go over it and I know your main proofreader usually
[01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:54.855]   just reads it and doesn't you know reserves comment but that she said wow if people really
[01:07:54.855 --> 01:07:59.355]   read this book it's going to shake things up that this is a really important book and I'm not putting
[01:07:59.355 --> 01:08:00.284]  down the last book.
[01:08:00.426 --> 01:08:02.066]  The last book's hardcore, quick read.
[01:08:02.706 --> 01:08:05.807]  This is twice as long on the globalist operation and what their plan is.
[01:08:06.308 --> 01:08:14.330]  This gets into a wide spectrum of how the globalists operate, what they're planning, and how we've got to conquer them, and then it really gets into admitted.
[01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:15.671]  Everything in here is admitted.
[01:08:16.351 --> 01:08:31.164]  Where the globalists have women get pregnant, this is what we know Epstein was into, Nygaard, you name it, and then they have them have the baby, or bring it to close to term, then they suck it dry of all its juices, and inject the juices into themselves.
[01:08:31.665 --> 01:08:34.747]  So that's like Count Dracula having a son or a daughter and then he drinks their blood.
[01:08:34.787 --> 01:08:45.248]   I mean this is beyond Count Dracula, and these people are on Television, this stuff's all open source, saying I kill my children and suck their juices.
[01:08:45.288 --> 01:08:48.249]  I mean, that's just a few pages of the book for people that don't know.
[01:08:48.289 --> 01:08:49.190]  This thing is insane.
[01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:57.074]  I mean, you know, generally, I'm, you know, anti any kind of censorship.
[01:08:57.514 --> 01:09:03.257]  But the truth is that, you know, the censorship that we've had has been of the wrong material.
[01:09:03.737 --> 01:09:24.811]   That, you know, we've been steered towards specific We've been, you know, gotten to the point where you go on to YouTube or to Google and the results that you get are designed by a big corporation or by the government with the intent of controlling what you think and what you believe.
[01:09:25.192 --> 01:09:26.893]  And that's what the real danger is.
[01:09:26.933 --> 01:09:29.194]  That's what the real problem that we have to fight is.
[01:09:29.535 --> 01:09:32.777]  And that's a part of the whole globalist agenda.
[01:09:33.317 --> 01:09:42.061]  But, you know, what this book really shows is that it's possible to fight back, that there can be a rebellion, and that that's actually happening now.
[01:09:42.341 --> 01:09:51.485]  That there's so many shows out there, there's so many people who are fighting back, who recognize what's happening, notwithstanding the best advertising in the world.
[01:09:51.786 --> 01:09:55.387]  You know, the most powerful people trying to control you.
[01:09:56.007 --> 01:10:01.550]  People are fighting back, and the desire for freedom is so incredibly strong that it's winning.
[01:10:06.428 --> 01:10:08.370]  Well, Tony, that's very well said.
[01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:12.774]  In closing, I'd like to drive the book to number one.
[01:10:12.814 --> 01:10:15.717]  I don't get paid as much when it's number one on Amazon, but it reaches more people.
[01:10:16.218 --> 01:10:23.986]  Last time the book went to number one, it was full autonomy number one in a bunch of the different rating services, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, but the New York Times refused to rate it.
[01:10:24.026 --> 01:10:26.188]  But regardless, it was number one bestseller.
[01:10:26.588 --> 01:10:28.250]  I'd really like to see this book go to number one.
[01:10:31.076 --> 01:10:34.399]  I mean, I think that people should even look at it like that.
[01:10:34.519 --> 01:10:38.762]  Look at this as sort of like a blow against censorship.
[01:10:39.042 --> 01:10:43.506]  They should buy this book, they should read it, they should get their friends, their family to read it.
[01:10:43.926 --> 01:10:51.872]  You know, it's so important that we not allow the government and these big powerful corporations to control our lives.
[01:10:52.332 --> 01:10:55.915]  And we have to be able to read things, even if we disagree with them.
[01:10:56.255 --> 01:11:04.118]  We have to be able to hear all the different points of views so that we have some way of deciding what we really believe.
[01:11:04.419 --> 01:11:17.244]  And this is a great book to read in order to get the alternative point of view that's been written by you, Alex Jones, the person who's been vilified in every newspaper in this country.
[01:11:17.264 --> 01:11:21.606]  And they're telling you, they're telling your viewers, don't read this book.
[01:11:22.086 --> 01:11:24.507]  And that's a great reason to read it.
[01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:26.228]  That should make you want to read it.
[01:11:26.489 --> 01:11:29.330]  That should make you say, I want to read this book.
[01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:30.431]  I want to display it.
[01:11:30.531 --> 01:11:32.032]  I want it up in my apartment.
[01:11:32.372 --> 01:11:39.936]  I want people to know that I'm not controlled, that I do what I want, that I read what I want, and that I decide what I believe.
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.121]  Well, that's what this is really all about.
[01:11:42.161 --> 01:11:43.242]  It's bigger than Alex Jones.
[01:11:43.262 --> 01:11:46.684]  I hate to put myself at the center of this, but I'm the guy they chose first for destruction.
[01:11:47.065 --> 01:11:50.067]  Trump's had more persecution, but he's got tens of billions of dollars to fight it.
[01:11:50.107 --> 01:11:50.407]  I don't.
[01:11:50.787 --> 01:11:54.290]  So per capita, I probably am one of the most persecuted people other than Julian Assange.
[01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:59.374]  And they'd like to put me in prison like they've done Owen Schroer, but not nine years of solitary confinement.
[01:11:59.414 --> 01:12:00.114]  Owen will be out soon.
[01:12:00.134 --> 01:12:00.795]  We're praying for him.
[01:12:01.415 --> 01:12:05.119]  But if they can set that precedent with him, they can do it with anybody, like Julian Assange.
[01:12:05.399 --> 01:12:07.862]  Where's the mainstream media defending fellow journalists?
[01:12:07.882 --> 01:12:08.342]  They're not.
[01:12:08.723 --> 01:12:10.765]  And so that's why we're in such a dangerous situation.
[01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:14.389]  And what they do is they steal your identity with censorship and build this straw man.
[01:12:14.689 --> 01:12:16.391]  This book allows people to see the real Alex Jones.
[01:12:16.731 --> 01:12:17.952]  Tony Lyons, thank you so much.
[01:12:17.972 --> 01:12:21.996]  People should get The Great Awakening now at Amazon.com or Infowarsstore.com.
[01:12:22.016 --> 01:12:22.817]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:12:23.898 --> 01:12:24.938]  Thank you.
[01:12:24.938 --> 01:12:28.938]  [Music]
[01:12:28.938 --> 01:12:30.938]  [Explosion]
[01:12:30.938 --> 01:12:32.938]  [Applause]
[01:12:32.938 --> 01:12:37.938]   Bullying God's name means a weapon with a hundred rounds in a chamber.
[01:12:38.407 --> 01:12:44.051]  The day before the Lewiston, Maine massacre, Mother Jones ran a story on banning AR-15s.
[01:12:44.311 --> 01:12:49.956]  Within hours after the massacre involving an AR-15, Kamala Harris wanted our guns.
[01:12:50.516 --> 01:13:00.744]  Once again, routine gatherings, this time at a bowling alley and a restaurant, have been turned into scenes of horrific carnage.
[01:13:01.225 --> 01:13:05.229]   And let us be clear, It does not have to be this way.
[01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:09.332]  As our friends in Australia have demonstrated.
[01:13:10.033 --> 01:13:18.521]  The Australian example reveals that after the horrific Port Arthur shooting that killed 35 people, the Australians confiscated firearms.
[01:13:18.942 --> 01:13:22.785]  The propaganda would tell you that no mass shootings have occurred since.
[01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:27.269]  However, 24 mass shootings have occurred in Australia since 1996.
[01:13:29.051 --> 01:13:32.333]  Take away the guns, because less guns will equal less mass shooting.
[01:13:32.973 --> 01:13:39.437]  Well, that's a problem, because as we've seen in Australia... Gee, throw that article up from the Australia Institute.
[01:13:39.817 --> 01:13:41.198]  Australia, colon.
[01:13:41.658 --> 01:13:44.020]  More guns now than before Port Arthur.
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:51.827]  New research from the Institute finds that there are more guns in Australia now than there were before the Port Arthur Massacre and introduction of strict gun control.
[01:13:52.147 --> 01:13:59.214]  So just to be clear, if your article is that, well, there are less mass shootings now because we took the guns, then your argument is actually the opposite.
[01:13:59.475 --> 01:14:01.957]  Because you're arguing that more guns equal less mass shooting.
[01:14:02.277 --> 01:14:03.238]  How are they arguing that?
[01:14:03.659 --> 01:14:04.680]  Because there's more guns!
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:09.403]  Reminder, the Second Amendment isn't about weapon type or caliber or hunting.
[01:14:09.723 --> 01:14:19.070]  It is about protecting American citizens from a tyrannical government, and at the very least, protecting themselves from a mass shooter released by our government.
[01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:21.692]  Nerves are rattled right now.
[01:14:22.873 --> 01:14:24.074]  Keeping an eye on the woods.
[01:14:26.288 --> 01:14:30.051]  Because I know those woods down there, they go run right back here.
[01:14:30.071 --> 01:14:33.133]  And I got my daughter inside.
[01:14:33.253 --> 01:14:34.014]  How old's your daughter?
[01:14:34.414 --> 01:14:35.255]  She's 10 years old.
[01:14:35.675 --> 01:14:39.658]  Has there ever been a more poignant time for the Second Amendment than right now?
[01:14:39.939 --> 01:14:59.475]   An internal memo obtained by Newsmax, the San Diego Field Office of Customs and Border Protection writes, San Diego Field Office Intelligence Unit assesses that individuals inspired by or reacting to the current Israel-Hamas conflict may attempt travel to or from the area of hostilities in the Middle East via circuitous transit across the southwest border.
[01:14:59.975 --> 01:15:07.601]  The memo continues, foreign fighters motivated by ideology or mercenary soldiers of fortune may attempt to obfuscate travel to or from the U.S.
[01:15:08.042 --> 01:15:10.784]  or to or from countries in the Middle East through Mexico.
[01:15:11.064 --> 01:15:17.072]   The memo comes as This weekend, Customs and Border Protection released its final figures for fiscal year 2023, showing 172 suspected terrorists.
[01:15:17.472 --> 01:15:18.654]  That's the highest number ever.
[01:15:22.958 --> 01:15:38.408]  In this heightened environment, there's no question we're seeing an increase in reported threats, and we've got to be on the lookout, especially for lone actors who may take inspiration from recent events to commit violence of their own.
[01:15:39.248 --> 01:15:41.570]  But the O'Biden installation presses on.
[01:15:41.710 --> 01:15:43.511]  As Reuters reported, the U.S.
[01:15:43.551 --> 01:15:52.377]  has stopped issuing export licenses for most civilian firearms and ammunition for 90 days for all non-governmental users.
[01:15:52.777 --> 01:16:05.868]  Citing national security and foreign policy interests and that the risk of firearms being diverted to entities or activities that promote regional instability, violate human rights, or fuel criminal activities.
[01:16:06.308 --> 01:16:14.195]  Exporters can continue to submit license requests during the pause, but they will be held without action until that pause is lifted.
[01:16:14.395 --> 01:16:18.598]  The Commerce Department declined to comment beyond the posting on its website.
[01:16:18.898 --> 01:16:19.139]  Sure.
[01:16:19.679 --> 01:16:25.181]  Not exporting guns and ammunition to our enemies makes sense, but there are more layers to this.
[01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:33.164]  The edict creates a chilling effect on American gun shops as their primary source of revenue is exports.
[01:16:33.624 --> 01:16:39.086]  A loophole, ultimately designed to put scores of small business gun owners out of business.
[01:16:39.486 --> 01:16:49.396]  Sending a rippling effect caused by shortages among supporters of the Second Amendment and those simply utilizing their God-given right to self-defense.
[01:16:49.717 --> 01:16:56.717]  John Bowne 40.
[01:16:56.717 --> 01:17:01.717]  Alright, I want to hit the freezing temperatures.
[01:17:02.665 --> 01:17:09.528]  60 million Americans under freeze alert as powerful Arctic blast crashes temps nationwide, and they've got the real numbers here.
[01:17:09.548 --> 01:17:20.131]  2023 is a year of record cold temperatures around the world, but the media is silent, lying to you, saying it's the hottest ever, which is not true.
[01:17:21.952 --> 01:17:23.833]  Is not true.
[01:17:25.053 --> 01:17:27.074]  But I want to shift gears into Joe Biden first.
[01:17:27.998 --> 01:17:34.361]  Archivist locates 82,000 pages of Joe Biden's pseudonym emails, possibly dwarfing the Clinton scandal.
[01:17:35.061 --> 01:17:40.923]  Oh, he didn't use the bit bleach to erase it, I guess, or have his employees smash up the phones like Hillary did.
[01:17:41.783 --> 01:17:43.824]  He lied and said he wasn't in business deals with Hunter.
[01:17:43.844 --> 01:17:45.705]  He lied and said he wasn't getting money from it.
[01:17:46.265 --> 01:17:46.965]  It's all lies.
[01:17:47.005 --> 01:17:50.787]  He owns a whole bunch of expensive houses while he was saying he was the poorest member of the Senate.
[01:17:52.088 --> 01:18:04.353]  And now we've learned that he had 40 FBI informants, since he was Vice President, in and around him to monitor all the criminal activity he was involved in while he blackmailed and was blackmailed.
[01:18:04.373 --> 01:18:05.634]  This is just par for the course.
[01:18:07.035 --> 01:18:11.416]  And Jesse Waters did a good job of this a few days ago, breaking it down.
[01:18:11.476 --> 01:18:12.257]  Here's what he had to say.
[01:18:14.594 --> 01:18:20.079]  Everything primetime has been saying about the FBI and the Biden family has just been confirmed.
[01:18:20.599 --> 01:18:25.464]  For years, we've told you the FBI knew everything the Bidens were up to.
[01:18:25.704 --> 01:18:29.467]  The cash, the Chinese diamonds, American policy for sale.
[01:18:30.228 --> 01:18:38.055]  Not only was Biden blackmailing other countries, and other countries blackmailing him, but the FBI was blackmailing Biden.
[01:18:39.136 --> 01:18:50.195]  Senator Chuck Grassley just announced that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has had 40 informants inside the Biden family for the last 15 years.
[01:18:52.025 --> 01:18:52.665]  What does that mean?
[01:18:53.386 --> 01:18:54.466]  It's exactly what you think.
[01:18:54.486 --> 01:19:06.550]  40 FBI informants, going back to the time Joe Biden was Vice President, have been providing criminal information to FBI field offices throughout the country.
[01:19:06.570 --> 01:19:16.434]  40 FBI informants have been feeding the Bureau exactly what Joe Biden, James Biden, and Hunter Biden have been doing all over the world.
[01:19:17.394 --> 01:19:21.136]  Primetime isn't sure the FBI had this many informants working on the Trump campaign.
[01:19:22.372 --> 01:19:26.335]  So, what does it mean that the FBI has had the Biden family wired?
[01:19:26.455 --> 01:19:29.597]  And what does it mean that the FBI hasn't done a thing?
[01:19:30.738 --> 01:19:36.342]  Well, it tells me that the FBI knows all of the president's dirty laundry and is blackmailing him.
[01:19:37.703 --> 01:19:38.864]  That's exactly how it works.
[01:19:38.884 --> 01:19:45.208]  Remember, Whitey Bulger, this is one one billionth of what Biden's done, killed dozens and dozens and dozens of people we know of.
[01:19:45.909 --> 01:19:51.173]  And we run around murdering people for the FBI over decades in Massachusetts, namely Boston.
[01:19:52.466 --> 01:19:53.668]  So he's an arm of the FBI.
[01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:56.692]  And of course Mueller was involved with that and all the rest of it.
[01:19:57.859 --> 01:20:03.161]  So that's all this is, is they are an organized crime syndicate at the top and in key jurisdictions.
[01:20:03.782 --> 01:20:06.783]  And now the organized crime syndicate is absorbing what's left of it.
[01:20:07.503 --> 01:20:13.226]  So by having all this dirt on Biden, Russia money, Ukraine money, China money, he was like a vending machine.
[01:20:13.266 --> 01:20:15.006]  He wasn't a Chinese agent or a Russian agent.
[01:20:15.327 --> 01:20:16.847]  He was an agent selling on America.
[01:20:17.307 --> 01:20:20.749]  They could come to him and get whatever they wanted as well with the blackmail.
[01:20:21.309 --> 01:20:22.770]  And you know Israel's involved.
[01:20:23.710 --> 01:20:27.613]  Israel was involved blackmailing Clinton over Monica Lewinsky, that came out, and British intelligence.
[01:20:29.194 --> 01:20:37.921]  They want fully compromised individuals who will carry out whatever crimes they want, and then if they ever get caught, or the thing comes out, they can just burn the minion.
[01:20:38.622 --> 01:20:40.183]  They can burn the puppet.
[01:20:41.704 --> 01:20:43.286]  That's how this situation works.
[01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:46.088]  That's how this paradigm operates.
[01:20:47.617 --> 01:20:54.379]  And now you see Biden following his orders to gut this country's treasury, to gut the borders, to just gut everything.
[01:20:54.499 --> 01:20:57.921]  And this country is in rapid, accelerated decline.
[01:20:58.601 --> 01:21:03.803]  And I just sit back and watch the FBI and the Justice Department that think they're fat and happy.
[01:21:04.423 --> 01:21:10.870]  But the globalists above them are literally de-industrializing the nation, so the money they get and what they make won't be worth anything.
[01:21:10.890 --> 01:21:12.351]  You won't be able to buy anything with it.
[01:21:12.591 --> 01:21:16.896]  You'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll be happy, as Klaus Schwab famously said.
[01:21:16.936 --> 01:21:20.099]  So this is amazing revelations, but we already knew it!
[01:21:21.513 --> 01:21:24.475]  Hell, this goes back to when J. Edgar Hoover had dirt on everybody, on the politicians.
[01:21:25.176 --> 01:21:32.061]  And then would have them under his control, or the interests that were blackmailing him, the mafia of him dressed as a woman and having sex with men.
[01:21:32.861 --> 01:21:35.984]  So that's how this has been operating for a long, long time.
[01:21:36.664 --> 01:21:38.886]  Very cynical, it's very sick, it's very dangerous.
[01:21:39.266 --> 01:21:41.788]  We'll talk about the record low temperatures when we come back.
[01:21:42.168 --> 01:21:43.949]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[01:21:45.010 --> 01:21:47.852]  We got some big breaking news that just happened in Congress.
[01:21:49.012 --> 01:22:03.400]  FBI Director Chris Wray just testified and revealed that Iran has assassination teams, sleeper cells inside the U.S.
[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:05.081]  That's definitely true.
[01:22:05.101 --> 01:22:18.865]   FBI Director Chris Wray reveals that Iran have made assassination attempts Not just assassination teams, they have assassination attempts have happened against high-ranking current and former U.S.
[01:22:18.885 --> 01:22:22.108]  government officials, including right here on American soil.
[01:22:22.248 --> 01:22:23.389]  Iran is serious.
[01:22:24.010 --> 01:22:27.153]  You're like, well you just spent the last segment attacking the FBI's leadership.
[01:22:27.333 --> 01:22:35.163]   Yeah, but I also study Hezbollah and Iran and the open borders, and when this happens, and he says it has happened, Who left the border open?
[01:22:35.184 --> 01:22:40.430]  Who's got bulldozers smashing barbed wire down in South Texas in violation of federal court orders right now?
[01:22:41.191 --> 01:22:41.592]  Oh, Biden.
[01:22:43.564 --> 01:22:44.525]  But think of the big picture.
[01:22:44.585 --> 01:22:51.428]  How much have I said they want to assassinate Biden if he won't step down and blame it on some group, either domestic or foreign?
[01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:54.250]  They've also been saying Iran wants to kill Trump.
[01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:56.671]  They can claim a truck bomb goes off and Iran did it.
[01:22:57.131 --> 01:22:58.052]  They want to kill Trump.
[01:22:58.092 --> 01:22:58.952]  They want to kill Biden.
[01:22:59.373 --> 01:23:01.754]  I'm the only person really saying they want to kill Biden, too.
[01:23:01.774 --> 01:23:04.596]  A lot of folks are saying, look at the trajectory of attacks on Trump.
[01:23:04.876 --> 01:23:05.476]  Nothing's working.
[01:23:05.496 --> 01:23:06.437]  The next thing is kill Trump.
[01:23:06.457 --> 01:23:08.858]  I said they'll have a right winger do it.
[01:23:09.986 --> 01:23:18.629]  Or claim they did it, a Patsy, another Lee Harvey Oswald or Tim McVeigh, or they'll let a group do it.
[01:23:19.589 --> 01:23:24.450]  They'll carry it out and blame a Patsy or Hab, an outside group, and allow an outside group to do it.
[01:23:26.491 --> 01:23:28.912]  This is very, very, very serious.
[01:23:28.972 --> 01:23:31.493]  We are in the countdown to them trying to suspend the election.
[01:23:32.353 --> 01:23:35.534]  If they kill Biden a few months out from the election, look for that to happen.
[01:23:37.096 --> 01:23:38.977]  I'm telling you, we are in so much danger.
[01:23:39.357 --> 01:23:40.938]  Things are so incredibly serious.
[01:23:42.678 --> 01:23:47.521]  And the public is smart in many ways, but not smart in others.
[01:23:48.381 --> 01:23:53.723]  And people just don't get wide-spectrum understanding, and it's completely out of control.
[01:23:53.783 --> 01:23:57.205]  Here's Ray, just an hour ago or so, testify to Congress.
[01:23:58.812 --> 01:24:13.081]  As the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, the Iranians, for instance, have directly, or by hiring criminals, mounted assassination attempts against dissidents and high-ranking current and former U.S.
[01:24:13.121 --> 01:24:17.364]  government officials, including right here on American soil.
[01:24:18.669 --> 01:24:33.657]  And along those lines, Hezbollah, Iran's primary strategic partner, has a history of seeding operatives and infrastructure, obtaining money and weapons, and spying in this country, going back years.
[01:24:36.078 --> 01:24:37.259]  And what have I been saying?
[01:24:37.759 --> 01:24:42.122]  Like it's broken record for years, but intensifying since October 7th.
[01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:47.552]  They're going to either allow Iran to attack or they're going to say Iran attacked.
[01:24:48.453 --> 01:24:51.154]  But then the media won't point out they brought all these people in by the millions.
[01:24:51.875 --> 01:24:53.636]  Hundreds of thousands of military age men from the Middle East.
[01:24:55.197 --> 01:24:56.778]  They're getting ready to make their move, folks.
[01:24:57.418 --> 01:24:58.499]  It's all pre-programmed.
[01:24:58.599 --> 01:25:24.142]   Ray's also out there saying a complete lie that right-wing Trump supporters, this is an FBI internal bulletins, six months ago, five months ago again, four months ago again, haven't seen one in four months, but they put out three memos To other law enforcement agencies and others saying, we believe Trump supporters are going to hack the power grid and bring it down working with Russia.
[01:25:24.862 --> 01:25:25.903]  So they do it.
[01:25:27.724 --> 01:25:30.306]  They use that to disrupt the election or whatever else they want.
[01:25:32.912 --> 01:25:41.678]  Then they bring in an internet kill switch to, quote, shut everybody else off the web so you can only go to certain sites, claiming free mobility on the web allows the hackers to keep hitting infrastructure.
[01:25:41.978 --> 01:25:44.960]  Now they've implemented the internet kill switch, using this as the cover.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:53.065]  Now a real attack by the Iranians or others, you hit 200 and something sites, it's less than 250 sites, with rifles.
[01:25:53.085 --> 01:25:55.187]  308 will do it.
[01:25:56.946 --> 01:26:09.034]  You hit these key transformers at key points that are known, that aren't hardened, that aren't protected, they should have steel jacketing, lead jacketing from EMP, and solar flares, and then steel to stop bullets.
[01:26:10.609 --> 01:26:13.692]  Congress has had multiple congressional hearings over the last decade.
[01:26:13.712 --> 01:26:28.528]  The last estimate was $3 billion and change to harden those 200 plus facilities with the big giant transformers and simply put armored boxes around them that have an inch of steel and then another quarter inch or so of lead.
[01:26:29.489 --> 01:26:30.169]  On the inside.
[01:26:31.069 --> 01:26:32.790]  And that protects it from solar flares.
[01:26:33.710 --> 01:26:35.190]  They had that, what, Carrington event.
[01:26:35.891 --> 01:26:36.151]  Was it 1913?
[01:26:36.271 --> 01:26:37.711]  I forget the exact date.
[01:26:38.171 --> 01:26:41.572]  Where half the planet's electricity blew out in Europe and the U.S.
[01:26:42.092 --> 01:26:48.113]  because a big solar flare came in and there was energy in it that heated up the power lines and blew all the little transformers up.
[01:26:49.914 --> 01:26:58.696]  So if we get hit by a direct solar flare, our magnetic field will block a lot of it, but the radiation will come through and will go into the wires.
[01:27:01.118 --> 01:27:13.168]  It's like you can hold a fluorescent light bulb up to a power cable outside and it will turn on because there's that much power leaking out of it, out of the power line.
[01:27:14.269 --> 01:27:20.955]  What do you think happens when a coronal mass ejection actually hits the earth dead on that last time it happened was a hundred and something years ago?
[01:27:21.535 --> 01:27:23.017]  It will blow everything out.
[01:27:24.178 --> 01:27:27.131]   So, First estimate was $2 billion.
[01:27:27.431 --> 01:27:28.131]  There's inflation.
[01:27:28.151 --> 01:27:33.413]  The last estimate, what, five years ago, I've had experts on, was $3 billion and something million.
[01:27:33.473 --> 01:27:35.594]  It was $3.7 billion.
[01:27:36.435 --> 01:27:39.656]  And there's only 200 and something sites that are the main switching systems.
[01:27:39.936 --> 01:27:42.957]  You blow all those out, it would take a year to get them all working.
[01:27:42.977 --> 01:27:43.898]  They don't have the spare parts.
[01:27:43.938 --> 01:27:44.718]  They don't have backups.
[01:27:45.198 --> 01:27:47.339]  One plan was to have backup transformers on site.
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:49.140]  So if these blow up, you can put the new ones in.
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:50.541]  But you still have to shield those.
[01:27:52.808 --> 01:27:55.209]  All you do is put a damn box around them.
[01:27:55.229 --> 01:27:56.229]  I'm going to say it again.
[01:27:56.569 --> 01:27:58.550]  All you do is put a box around it.
[01:27:59.590 --> 01:28:02.251]  All you do is put a steel-lead box around it.
[01:28:04.832 --> 01:28:10.334]  Oh, there's $300 billion or whatever per all these other countries this year for all these wars.
[01:28:10.354 --> 01:28:11.695]  Another $100 billion they want now.
[01:28:12.995 --> 01:28:14.156]  That's all fine and dandy.
[01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:17.337]  But we don't have $4 billion to shield it.
[01:28:18.757 --> 01:28:25.644]  And then they're saying, we're gonna go in and hack the internet through the internet.
[01:28:26.205 --> 01:28:28.748]  Meanwhile, they let Huawei put up their transmitters everywhere.
[01:28:28.968 --> 01:28:29.789]  You can do it with those.
[01:28:31.751 --> 01:28:32.712]  It just gives me a headache.
[01:28:32.992 --> 01:28:34.674]  It absolutely pisses me off too.
[01:28:35.695 --> 01:28:41.381]  So, our evil government that's got money for everything.
[01:28:45.305 --> 01:28:49.768]  Biden's putting in $45 billion to take over former government buildings and put homeless in it.
[01:28:50.088 --> 01:28:51.229]  Those will just be FEMA camps.
[01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:52.570]  Oh, the poor people stay there.
[01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:57.713]  And as more people are poor, you then go live in that, but it's really a prison camp and it just normalizes it.
[01:28:58.053 --> 01:28:58.994]  That's the headline today.
[01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:03.397]  They've got all these COVID emergency centers that can hold millions.
[01:29:03.417 --> 01:29:07.880]  They're building all over every Western country and the UN says it's to hold people during the next pandemic.
[01:29:10.413 --> 01:29:14.514]  So they got $45 billion to turn government buildings into homeless shelters.
[01:29:14.774 --> 01:29:15.314]  They're doing it.
[01:29:16.315 --> 01:29:22.716]  They don't have $3 plus billion to harden the damn things from the Iranians or whoever else wants to attack them.
[01:29:24.157 --> 01:29:31.339]  And by the way, you take out 200 and whatever it was, I forget the number, 240 something sites, I forget the exact number, we've had top experts on.
[01:29:31.919 --> 01:29:34.900]  You take those out, the whole power goes out.
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:38.861]  You take out a couple dozen, you can take out whole power corridors over multiple states.
[01:29:40.782 --> 01:29:43.324]  And then they don't have even new ones built.
[01:29:43.384 --> 01:29:44.666]  They don't have stockpiles of them.
[01:29:45.727 --> 01:29:49.750]  It's like a part for a weird car that you've got to wait a year to get the part sent to you.
[01:29:49.770 --> 01:29:51.172]  Maybe you can never get the part sent to you.
[01:29:51.552 --> 01:29:52.633]  So you got to junk the car.
[01:29:53.594 --> 01:29:55.355]  I mean, do I have to explain how crazy this is?
[01:29:56.356 --> 01:30:04.504]  They should have lead steel shielded facilities at all 200 plus sites with backups.
[01:30:04.544 --> 01:30:05.385]  That's even smarter.
[01:30:07.176 --> 01:30:09.802]  Or they should shield them in place, which costs more money.
[01:30:10.183 --> 01:30:11.807]  Because you gotta build it around the wires.
[01:30:13.491 --> 01:30:14.232]  I don't know, folks.
[01:30:14.413 --> 01:30:16.056]  It's just totally insane, and...
[01:30:18.208 --> 01:30:28.114]  I don't even know what to say at this point anymore, but I can see the enemy war game and see this coming before they said the right-wing Trump supporters are going to aid Russia in cutting off the power grid by a cyber attack.
[01:30:28.154 --> 01:30:32.696]  And that's how they'll probably do it, because they don't want to actually blow the infrastructure up, because they know they couldn't even get a turn back on.
[01:30:33.117 --> 01:30:42.522]  But they can still turn it off, say we did it, and everybody gets mad, and then they go, oh, and now to get on the web, you've got to have an internet ID, and you've got to come register here at the government to make sure you're not a hacker.
[01:30:42.762 --> 01:30:44.003]  They've already proposed that now.
[01:30:44.123 --> 01:30:44.843]  I foresaw that.
[01:30:44.883 --> 01:30:45.664]  Now they're proposing it.
[01:30:46.064 --> 01:30:47.225]  You can say one of two things.
[01:30:47.785 --> 01:30:51.609]  Either I know how to scan the enemy's operations or I give them ideas, and that's not what it is.
[01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:57.475]  So many times I war game what I would do if I was them, getting in their mind, and then I'll read a white paper from 20 years ago.
[01:30:57.735 --> 01:31:01.899]  Like, I'll figure it out now, organically, and then later people go, oh, you didn't know that?
[01:31:02.019 --> 01:31:08.285]  Here's this, and I'm reading some 10-year-old document or 5-year-old or 20-year-old document, and it's word-for-word what I envisioned.
[01:31:08.326 --> 01:31:10.488]  No, no, they're not getting their ideas from me, folks.
[01:31:11.229 --> 01:31:14.491]  I'm getting my ideas from them, watching them, and how they operate.
[01:31:14.531 --> 01:31:19.334]  I couldn't come up with this crap, but I've seen enough of the stuff they do to know what their next move is.
[01:31:19.375 --> 01:31:24.578]  So, with the FBI coming out and saying, Iranians have already killed people?
[01:31:25.238 --> 01:31:26.259]  I've told you that, by the way.
[01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:28.260]  They're all over the place.
[01:31:29.541 --> 01:31:32.904]  And I know that from people very close to me that didn't tell me anything classified.
[01:31:33.824 --> 01:31:35.385]  They just told me what was going on.
[01:31:36.166 --> 01:31:37.887]  And I'm going to leave it at that, and these are the people that would know.
[01:31:38.788 --> 01:31:39.228]  Believe it.
[01:31:40.518 --> 01:31:48.562]  Army Special Operations, people inside the FBI, high-level feds that I know personally.
[01:31:48.742 --> 01:31:50.323]  That's why I say the whole government's not bad.
[01:31:50.823 --> 01:31:52.904]  A lot of people in government are good, but they're compartmentalized.
[01:31:53.405 --> 01:32:03.730]  Evil is in control of... You have a lot of good people on a ship, but if the captain's crazy and trying to run you over a reef or set the damn boat on fire, at a certain point you gotta stop these lunatics.
[01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:07.592]  And we're all on this ship going right over the edge of a waterfall right now.
[01:32:08.172 --> 01:32:09.712]  All right, we're going to start the third hour.
[01:32:10.252 --> 01:32:12.573]  We have a former Army intelligence officer who's super smart.
[01:32:12.913 --> 01:32:15.294]  Joining us to talk big picture and more World War III.
[01:32:15.654 --> 01:32:16.094]  Stay with us.
[01:32:15.913 --> 01:32:22.913]  Another sour number three.
[01:32:22.913 --> 01:32:35.592]  America's not perfect.
[01:32:35.592 --> 01:32:36.673]  (laughs)
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:40.241]  For instance, the colonies were founded, and the U.S.
[01:32:40.281 --> 01:32:42.302]  was founded off of tobacco and whiskey.
[01:32:43.363 --> 01:32:43.883]  That's a fact.
[01:32:43.963 --> 01:32:45.944]  Sam Adams didn't just produce beer, he produced whiskey.
[01:32:46.304 --> 01:32:50.466]  He was one of the main patrons of George Washington in that war.
[01:32:51.326 --> 01:32:55.368]  George Washington helped pay troops with liquor that he himself produced.
[01:32:56.228 --> 01:32:59.950]  That's an amazing part of Americana, and we should use this responsibly.
[01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:07.128]   You know, sometimes I go four months before I have a cigar, Or before I have a glass of whiskey.
[01:33:08.048 --> 01:33:11.090]  But I tell you, there's a lot of great whiskey out there.
[01:33:12.230 --> 01:33:17.312]  But a few years ago, we ran into some great folks that are craft whiskey producers here in the United States.
[01:33:17.352 --> 01:33:18.032]  We're big listeners.
[01:33:18.653 --> 01:33:28.897]  And they said, we've got some of the best whiskeys produced in Kentucky, Tennessee, you name it, with people that won't turn over their whiskey to anybody else that they want to bring to you.
[01:33:29.277 --> 01:33:31.918]  And these guys put out some of the top names in the country.
[01:33:33.041 --> 01:33:38.603]  Some of the highest-end specialties out there that sell for $500, $300 a bottle.
[01:33:39.103 --> 01:33:46.846]  And they said, but because we support you so much, I looked it up, it was true, we're going to let you sell this to people at a fraction of the price.
[01:33:47.946 --> 01:33:57.369]  We're going to come out with a Kentucky bourbon that is high quality for a fraction of the price because we want to support your broadcast.
[01:33:57.409 --> 01:33:58.350]  And that was about two years ago.
[01:33:58.370 --> 01:33:59.530]  I said, great, let's do it.
[01:34:00.811 --> 01:34:02.752]  Then about a year ago, they bottled it.
[01:34:03.052 --> 01:34:04.172]  It's a very special bottle.
[01:34:04.192 --> 01:34:05.032]  A collector's item.
[01:34:05.532 --> 01:34:06.393]  Conspiracy bourbon.
[01:34:07.233 --> 01:34:10.574]  And they tried to bring it into stores where they already had their other products.
[01:34:11.054 --> 01:34:12.115]  And all hell broke loose.
[01:34:12.835 --> 01:34:15.176]  And they went through so many attacks trying to bring this to the public.
[01:34:16.016 --> 01:34:22.598]  And that made me go from just letting them use my name to promote this to me getting fully behind it because they're trying to stop us.
[01:34:23.746 --> 01:34:31.772]  When we just launched this a day ago, they took away the banking of the company with the website ConspiracyBourbon.com, but they had it back up within just an hour.
[01:34:32.352 --> 01:34:34.734]  So they are literally trying to shut this down.
[01:34:34.754 --> 01:34:38.276]  They're so scared of us moving into the culture that the globalists control.
[01:34:38.997 --> 01:34:40.017]  If you don't drink, that's great.
[01:34:40.038 --> 01:34:40.678]  More power to you.
[01:34:40.718 --> 01:34:46.562]  But if you like a good bourbon, you like a good Kentucky bourbon, a good Kentucky whiskey, this is amazing.
[01:34:46.602 --> 01:34:50.534]   And folks, you've got to check out This bottle for yourself.
[01:34:51.195 --> 01:34:55.636]  If you've got a blacklight, this bottle is very, very special.
[01:34:56.296 --> 01:35:04.479]  No one that we've ever heard of has come up with a bottle like this, that when you put a blacklight on it, has all these secret messages.
[01:35:05.259 --> 01:35:11.842]  Yeah, the CIA created the term conspiracy theory to try to demonize people that questioned official narratives after they killed Kennedy.
[01:35:12.562 --> 01:35:17.964]  But now we wear that attack like a badge of honor.
[01:35:19.144 --> 01:35:21.125]  And it's absolutely blown up in the system's face.
[01:35:22.266 --> 01:35:30.631]  So this is the first salvo in a whole product line to really take over the term conspiracy and use it to bring back our republic.
[01:35:31.111 --> 01:35:35.273]  Think of this as the opposite of Anheuser-Busch and Bud Light and Dylan Mulvaney.
[01:35:35.713 --> 01:35:39.496]  Think of this as the anti-Dylan Mulvaney and that's what it is.
[01:35:39.516 --> 01:35:41.357]  There's only 10,000 bottles of this.
[01:35:42.037 --> 01:35:45.599]  I would imagine when many of you see this letter you'll try to go buy it at ConspiracyBourbon.com.
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:46.720]  You want to be able to get it.

[01:35:59.208 --> 01:36:01.850]  Special reports, investigative reports, you name it.

[01:36:25.849 --> 01:36:27.489]  Our special guest is coming up here.
[01:36:27.531 --> 01:36:28.672]  This is a short little segment.
[01:36:28.692 --> 01:36:30.013]  I forgot to plug last hour.
[01:36:30.033 --> 01:36:30.994]  I'm going to plug right now.
[01:36:31.595 --> 01:36:33.116]  We're going to hit a ton of critical news.
[01:36:33.917 --> 01:36:37.441]  There's two great products you should really get, and you really should get these.
[01:36:37.581 --> 01:36:40.143]  One is Silver Bullet, 30 parts of colloidal silver.
[01:36:40.183 --> 01:36:43.506]  Again, this is a private label of one of the top brands in the country.
[01:36:43.527 --> 01:36:52.853]   30 parts per million is seen by scientists and experts as the most effective and safest colloidal silver to use, either internally in your mouth, or for your gums and your throat and you name it,
[01:36:52.853 --> 01:36:56.212]   or also for topical things like scratches and burns and things like that.
[01:36:56.212 --> 01:36:59.672]   I also like to put it on my toothpaste, a couple drops of it each morning.
[01:36:59.672 --> 01:37:01.893]  It's really good for you at those levels.
[01:37:01.893 --> 01:37:03.512]  For my research, check it out for yourself.
[01:37:03.512 --> 01:37:10.113]   Silver Bullet in stock at Infowarsstore.com and your funds support the broadcast.
[01:37:10.113 --> 01:37:12.432]   Also, I'm gonna explain this again, Super Female Vitality.
[01:37:12.432 --> 01:37:15.172]   Super Male is a best seller, but we always make some Super Female.
[01:37:15.172 --> 01:37:18.233]   Women wanna order something with a pink label, it's the same formula.
[01:37:18.233 --> 01:37:20.192]  It boosts stamina, libido, energy.
[01:37:20.192 --> 01:37:21.552]  It's cold-pressed herbs.
[01:37:21.552 --> 01:37:24.112]  So they're more active, they're more effective.
[01:37:24.112 --> 01:37:25.792]  The Male is sold out.
[01:37:25.792 --> 01:37:27.391]  We have some more of the Female.
[01:37:27.309 --> 01:37:28.369]  It's going to sell out soon.
[01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:28.949]  It's great.
[01:37:29.429 --> 01:37:30.270]  Has great effects.
[01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:31.690]  Kicks in in a day or two.
[01:37:32.151 --> 01:37:34.091]  Check it out yourself and it funds the operation.
[01:37:34.511 --> 01:37:38.713]  Superfemalevitality.infowarstore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:37:38.733 --> 01:37:39.673]  And then now our big sale.
[01:37:44.204 --> 01:37:45.225]  Is RainForce Ultra.
[01:37:45.265 --> 01:37:46.325]  That's not RainForce Plus.
[01:37:46.465 --> 01:37:48.706]  RainForce Plus lasts four to six hours.
[01:37:49.166 --> 01:37:53.989]  Super strong, high-quality nootropic for brain energy, clarity, focus, without the letdown.
[01:37:54.489 --> 01:37:58.090]  RainForce Ultra is a fast-acting, special proprietary blend.
[01:37:58.431 --> 01:38:00.031]  It takes 15 minutes on average to kick in.
[01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:01.532]  Dissipates in two to three hours.
[01:38:02.552 --> 01:38:11.997]  I like it because, again, a lot of times I don't want to take something super strong when I'm tired and still got to do a radio show or a TV interview or, you know, go out or something with friends.
[01:38:13.171 --> 01:38:14.532]  I'll take a squirt of this under the tongue.
[01:38:14.572 --> 01:38:15.273]  Hits really quick.
[01:38:15.313 --> 01:38:16.393]  Wears off in three hours.
[01:38:16.433 --> 01:38:16.994]  Sleep great.
[01:38:17.934 --> 01:38:21.677]  And it's still really strong for the two to three hours that it hits.
[01:38:21.717 --> 01:38:23.338]  So it's really amazing.
[01:38:24.579 --> 01:38:28.142]  It's, again, cold-pressed herbs, other compounds as well.
[01:38:28.182 --> 01:38:29.523]  So you get the full effect.

[01:38:35.184 --> 01:38:37.265]  Super boosts your immune system, especially during fall and winter.
[01:38:37.285 --> 01:38:38.425]  50% off.
[01:38:38.465 --> 01:38:39.345]  Organic green fibers.
[01:38:39.806 --> 01:38:43.166]  It's the very best greens when they're babies, when they're sprouts.
[01:38:43.667 --> 01:38:48.628]  It has all these amazing compounds and nutrients in it that's so good for your overall health, but particularly flushing out your gut.
[01:38:49.208 --> 01:38:50.788]  Vitamin D3 gummies are super strong.
[01:38:50.828 --> 01:38:51.889]  High quality vitamin D3.
[01:38:51.929 --> 01:38:53.089]  That's critical to immune system.
[01:38:53.469 --> 01:38:55.090]  Doughnut sleep support's really strong.
[01:38:55.130 --> 01:38:55.590]  Hits quick.
[01:38:55.610 --> 01:38:58.771]   Gives you deep Sleep, great dreams, it's 40% off.
[01:38:58.791 --> 01:39:02.533]  Whole Foods multivitamin is from an organic vitamin source, so you get a better absorption.
[01:39:02.553 --> 01:39:05.354]  Some of the synthetic vitamins are actually toxic, it's not synthetic.
[01:39:05.814 --> 01:39:07.315]  SuperFluid Vitality, 40% off.
[01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:12.558]  InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:39:12.938 --> 01:39:16.459]  And again, we need your support here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:19.881]  InfoWars is right on the edge of the red and the black.
[01:39:20.942 --> 01:39:23.563]  We're still going forward, staying on air.
[01:39:24.063 --> 01:39:25.744]  If we have the funds, we won't be shut down.
[01:39:27.193 --> 01:39:32.281]  That allows us to go on and continue on forward for at least three years.
[01:39:33.543 --> 01:39:37.368]  And if we survive that long, hell, I'll be ready to hang it up.
[01:39:38.410 --> 01:39:41.635]  If we don't get your support, well, you'll see what's going to happen.
[01:39:41.675 --> 01:39:42.656]  And don't get mad at me.
[01:39:44.469 --> 01:39:46.050]  If we turn the lights out around here.
[01:39:46.351 --> 01:39:47.411]  And it won't happen overnight.
[01:39:47.432 --> 01:39:49.493]  We've got orders in and we're going to shut down.
[01:39:49.553 --> 01:39:51.775]  It'll take three months minimum, six months probably.
[01:39:52.355 --> 01:39:55.638]  But suddenly we'll announce, oh by the way, we're shutting down in three months.
[01:39:55.658 --> 01:39:56.999]  People are like, whoa, we're going to support now.
[01:39:57.319 --> 01:39:57.960]  Don't shut down.
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:39:59.061]  It doesn't work like that.
[01:39:59.361 --> 01:40:03.004]  You don't build an infrastructure and have all the bills you've got to pay, the things you've got to do.
[01:40:03.204 --> 01:40:06.727]  You've got to buy product forward because we can't just have regular sponsors.
[01:40:06.767 --> 01:40:07.448]  They get run off.
[01:40:07.468 --> 01:40:08.649]  We've got to self-fund.
[01:40:09.269 --> 01:40:11.310]  There's just a lot went into building this operation.
[01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:12.890]  I put incredible amounts of money into it.
[01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:14.951]  You put incredible amounts of money into it.
[01:40:15.511 --> 01:40:17.892]  So let's not let this important operation go.
[01:40:18.332 --> 01:40:19.592]  Get products that enrich your life.
[01:40:19.652 --> 01:40:20.312]  It's a win-win.
[01:40:20.693 --> 01:40:23.974]  Go to infowarestore.com right now.
[01:40:24.654 --> 01:40:25.894]  And it's amazing.
[01:40:26.314 --> 01:40:27.335]  And the products are incredible.
[01:40:27.655 --> 01:40:29.675]  If you want to support me, I do a once a week show.
[01:40:29.695 --> 01:40:31.776]  It's usually two hours long, sometimes three hours long.
[01:40:32.356 --> 01:40:35.778]  And you get all the other Steven Crowder shows and more for like seven bucks a month.
[01:40:36.078 --> 01:40:38.139]  Get a month free at jonescrowder.com.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:41.101]  All the Ladder with Crowder websites and all their other shows.
[01:40:42.042 --> 01:40:44.963]  When you go to jonescrowder.com, that supports me individually.
[01:40:45.444 --> 01:40:48.025]  Because they make me pay half the legal bills in this place.
[01:40:48.906 --> 01:40:50.927]  And that's why it's close to shutting down.
[01:40:50.987 --> 01:40:52.808]  InfoWars has a little bit extra money.
[01:40:53.208 --> 01:40:53.929]  I'm upside down.
[01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:57.170]  And when they did the accounting this morning, it's just insane.
[01:40:57.411 --> 01:40:58.331]  But hey, here's the good news.
[01:40:58.551 --> 01:40:59.272]  I never gave up.
[01:41:00.114 --> 01:41:01.797]  But if I give out, that's the way it is.
[01:41:01.917 --> 01:41:04.821]  So, you'll know about it if it's going to happen.
[01:41:04.861 --> 01:41:07.545]  But, I mean, we're not playing games around here.
[01:41:07.806 --> 01:41:08.607]  We need your support.
[01:41:08.967 --> 01:41:09.709]  Don't make me show you.
[01:41:11.258 --> 01:41:15.781]  All right, Scott Bennett, I've been trying to get him on for about a week, and he's here with us.
[01:41:15.821 --> 01:41:17.582]  We're very honored to have him, very pleased.
[01:41:17.602 --> 01:41:20.184]  Couldn't have a better expert on to decode what's happening.
[01:41:20.844 --> 01:41:29.430]  And before this broke again today, I was literally going to ask him about globalist false flags in America, claiming Hezbollah has done it.
[01:41:29.871 --> 01:41:31.712]  Now, Hezbollah does have sleeper cells here.
[01:41:31.732 --> 01:41:32.332]  That's true.
[01:41:32.372 --> 01:41:33.073]  That's going on.
[01:41:33.953 --> 01:41:37.175]  And I've also seen them saying the power is going to get taken out for years.
[01:41:37.195 --> 01:41:40.658]  And they're going to use that as a pretext to suspend elections, martial law.
[01:41:41.298 --> 01:41:46.320]  Then I said I would imagine they'll claim right-wingers working with Putin are going to do it because that follows their narrative.
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:54.683]  Then six months ago they came out, I'll show you articles, and said the right-wing working with Russia is going to target the power grid in FBI bulletins with zero proof.
[01:41:55.643 --> 01:42:05.387]  Now they've got new headlines out, exclusive neo-Nazi domestic terrorists are targeting critical power stations with guns, explosives, and coordinated attacks as they destroy America's way of life.
[01:42:05.847 --> 01:42:06.708]  Watchdog warns.
[01:42:08.479 --> 01:42:09.960]  Biden is shutting off the power plants.
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:12.681]  Biden is shutting off the pipelines, Keystone and others.
[01:42:14.041 --> 01:42:19.103]  Biden is killing the new oil drilling and gas drilling permits all over the country, all over the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:42:19.964 --> 01:42:22.185]  They're the ones draining the Strategic Oil Reserve.
[01:42:22.685 --> 01:42:25.006]  They're the ones blowing up the Nord Stream Pipeline.
[01:42:25.666 --> 01:42:32.389]  They're the ones doing all this, then with no proof, saying domestic right-wingers are about to do this imminently.
[01:42:33.730 --> 01:42:34.290]  Imminently.
[01:42:35.495 --> 01:42:37.416]  That means, to me, they're getting ready to do it.
[01:42:38.336 --> 01:42:40.697]  And blame us, because they've already pre-programmed it.
[01:42:40.717 --> 01:42:42.878]  It's not like I just said that once they said this.
[01:42:42.938 --> 01:42:44.379]  I said it before they did it.
[01:42:44.419 --> 01:42:52.482]  Now, Chris Wray, the head of the FBI, gets up today and says, Iranians have killed Americans and are trying to kill government leaders right now in America.
[01:42:53.903 --> 01:42:58.385]  But they're the ones with bulldozers ramming down the barbed wire.
[01:42:59.105 --> 01:42:59.946]  Caught on tape now.
[01:43:00.965 --> 01:43:01.466]  In Texas.
[01:43:01.486 --> 01:43:02.567]  We'll roll some B-roll of that.
[01:43:03.448 --> 01:43:04.429]  So this is a big deal.
[01:43:04.449 --> 01:43:05.810]  They're getting ready for something big.
[01:43:06.991 --> 01:43:08.373]  Will they assassinate Biden?
[01:43:09.013 --> 01:43:09.874]  Blame it on the right wing?
[01:43:09.914 --> 01:43:10.795]  Or say Hezbollah did it?
[01:43:10.855 --> 01:43:14.899]  Or will Hezbollah get more money through Iran from Biden as part of some deal?
[01:43:15.936 --> 01:43:21.561]  We know the Iranians worked with the Reagan administration before he got in power to set up Jimmy Carter with the whole hostage thing.
[01:43:22.041 --> 01:43:23.363]  And that's all been declassified.
[01:43:23.383 --> 01:43:25.685]  And Iran-Contra and all the rest of it.
[01:43:26.185 --> 01:43:29.608]  So here's Director Wray with this incredible statement.
[01:43:29.648 --> 01:43:31.209]  Remember, they're the ones that have opened the borders up.
[01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:34.472]  They're the ones saying we're going to bring in Hamas refugees.
[01:43:34.832 --> 01:43:37.234]  And then they think we're so stupid we don't know they're the ones that brought them here.
[01:43:37.975 --> 01:43:45.740]  Are they really setting it up where they're going to do it, and either blame the American people or Hezbollah, and use that as an excuse to strike Iran?
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:46.281]  Here's the clip.
[01:43:47.822 --> 01:44:02.091]  As the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, the Iranians, for instance, have directly, or by hiring criminals, mounted assassination attempts against dissidents and high-ranking current and former U.S.
[01:44:02.131 --> 01:44:06.374]  government officials, including right here on American soil.
[01:44:07.662 --> 01:44:22.650]  And along those lines, Hezbollah, Iran's primary strategic partner, has a history of seeding operatives and infrastructure, obtaining money and weapons, and spying in this country, going back years.
[01:44:25.731 --> 01:44:26.172]  Chilling.
[01:44:27.232 --> 01:44:28.133]  Absolutely chilling.
[01:44:28.213 --> 01:44:28.813]  Scott Bennett?
[01:44:30.049 --> 01:44:42.958]  He's a second lieutenant, was a PhD US Army Specialist, Operations Officer, Psychological Warfare Analyst, and he began to expose the criminal activities of Obama, working with the different terrorist groups and more.
[01:44:43.319 --> 01:44:44.900]  He's also a best-selling author.
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:49.083]  You can find his different websites by going to GlobalFreedomTV.com.
[01:44:49.543 --> 01:44:51.184]  GlobalFreedomTV.com.
[01:44:51.684 --> 01:45:06.456]   You can read his whole outstanding bio right there on the site as well, and he's been persecuted For being a whistleblower and exposing everything that we're now witnessing from the George W. Bush administration, on through Obama, and more.
[01:45:07.076 --> 01:45:11.220]  Since he started exposing them in 2010, 13 years ago.
[01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:17.024]  So you're an expert in foreign affairs, you're an expert in banking, terrorism, false flags, all of it.
[01:45:17.365 --> 01:45:31.944]   How would you describe the climate we're in right now, what's happening around the world, this new chilling information, the Israeli-Gaza war, Putin's starting to come out against Israel, Erdogan coming out against Israel, the domino effect that we saw in World War I. Where do you want to start here?
[01:45:31.984 --> 01:45:34.829]  I'm going to skip this break and try to give you the floor at least for about 15 minutes.
[01:45:36.903 --> 01:45:41.645]  Well Alex, first of all, God bless you and your staff and may the Lord protect you and continue.
[01:45:41.665 --> 01:45:46.047]  He says, Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and all things shall be added unto you.
[01:45:46.207 --> 01:45:53.711]  So we expect God to provide all of the needs that you have to continue running your studios and broadcasting the truth.
[01:45:53.771 --> 01:46:06.537]  And when you were advertising before, I want to say we have a website called destroy-cancer.com where we give people the Indian black salve and I've used it to kill cancer.
[01:46:07.057 --> 01:46:11.782]  I'll say this, everyone that orders a bottle, we will give $10 to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:11.802 --> 01:46:14.585]  You just inspired me to say that right now.
[01:46:15.065 --> 01:46:17.328]  So just email us and we'll give $10.
[01:46:17.768 --> 01:46:21.052]  I've certainly read about that in Black Sabbath, especially on skin cancer and things.
[01:46:21.072 --> 01:46:21.732]  That's very interesting.
[01:46:22.073 --> 01:46:23.514]  So where do people go to get that?
[01:46:23.554 --> 01:46:24.916]  I appreciate your support as we need the funds.
[01:46:25.949 --> 01:46:27.831]  It works and I used it, Alex.
[01:46:27.911 --> 01:46:32.776]  It saved my life and it gives me chills because the Lord says, Behold, I'm the Lord who heals.
[01:46:32.916 --> 01:46:42.525]  Just go to www.destroy-cancer.com and we'll give $10 to the Alex Jones Show for everybody that orders.
[01:46:42.585 --> 01:46:48.291]  Just say Alex Jones in the email and I'll mark it as of right now 11 a.m.
[01:46:48.411 --> 01:46:49.052]  Pacific Time.
[01:46:49.472 --> 01:46:55.781]  But we want to give back to you Alex, because you've been sowing and leading in a way that no one else has.
[01:46:56.041 --> 01:46:59.165]  So may God continue to anoint you to speak the truth.
[01:46:59.265 --> 01:47:01.689]  So people go to destroy-cancer.com.
[01:47:02.189 --> 01:47:07.868]   Now on the macro level, The most important thing I think to remember is this.
[01:47:08.548 --> 01:47:29.880]  The reason that Christopher Wray and the Democrats and the neocons and all of these false government officials that have usurped the American government by a fake election and overthrowing Donald Trump in a coup d'etat, which we know is directly tied back to the Chinese Communist Party and their interference in the election machines, which I provided when I was back in Washington, D.C.
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:31.301]  as part of Trump's analytical team.
[01:47:31.761 --> 01:47:42.985]  The reason that they fear the white, Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Germanic, Scandinavian, Protestant, Presbyterian, Catholic, Christian, whatever you want to call them, is because of one simple reason.
[01:47:43.585 --> 01:47:45.186]  We are influencers.
[01:47:45.746 --> 01:48:03.033]   We can influence and persuade and communicate rationally, multi-dimensionally, to all of the other races, tribes, ethnicities in the United States, and can convince the vast majority of them who are traditional people Traditional values.
[01:48:03.073 --> 01:48:05.417]  Love family, love God, love traditional marriage.
[01:48:05.917 --> 01:48:08.641]  We can influence them unlike anyone else.
[01:48:09.142 --> 01:48:14.269]  And in influencing them, we automatically gain control of 65-70% of the electoral voting block.
[01:48:18.334 --> 01:48:22.758]  That would then push this tiny fraction of psychopaths out of political power.
[01:48:23.339 --> 01:48:39.475]  So that is why Christopher Wray and Biden and all of these lunatics are obsessively, pathologically determined to blame white Anglo-Saxon people for being right-wing extremists, whatever the term is.
[01:48:40.295 --> 01:48:46.398]  They have to try and demonize the Trump-supporting, MAGA-supporting, Republican-conservative types.
[01:48:47.358 --> 01:48:54.142]  Because we are the key to changing this country, and I think your program is the tip of the spear of that.
[01:48:55.482 --> 01:49:15.149]  Anointing people, you're broadcasting and speaking to people in a way that moves their hearts, that consolidates and aligns and harmonizes their deep unspoken instincts and intuition into what is right, what is good, what is true, what is beautiful, what is healthy, what is natural.
[01:49:15.829 --> 01:49:17.609]  That is the key.
[01:49:18.069 --> 01:49:18.910]  Remember this too.
[01:49:19.930 --> 01:49:23.431]  Spiritual winds move political sails.
[01:49:24.031 --> 01:49:29.872]  And the spiritual wind is what's coming out of your voice, your mouth, and others.
[01:49:30.092 --> 01:49:35.973]  We're speaking spiritually, and also that manifests into physical reality.
[01:49:36.373 --> 01:49:46.995]  But that spiritual wind is going to move the political sails to the Great Awakening, to the Great Renaissance, to what we've been saying for the past couple years now.
[01:49:47.495 --> 01:49:52.119]  So you're seeing a great separation in the United States and beyond between the sheep and the goats.
[01:49:52.259 --> 01:50:07.110]  Those who believe in the traditional family values and the Constitution and all the great things of America, and those who are the neocon lobotomized hyper-vaccinated control maniacs that are again pursuing this endless 9-11 agenda.
[01:50:08.631 --> 01:50:18.538]  So I wanted to just capture what's happening in the United States is their desperation to try and knock out the key influencers of society, which is the conservatives.
[01:50:18.958 --> 01:50:32.247]  The other thing that they're doing, and you said it before as well, and we've said it, they are lining up Joe Biden for an assassination, but they will do it when Gavin Newsom is positioned into the vice presidency position.
[01:50:32.287 --> 01:50:37.471]  That's why he went over to China last week, is to divulge their larger macro plan.
[01:50:38.351 --> 01:50:43.577]  And I suspect they will appoint Gavin Newsom into Kamala Harris's position.
[01:50:43.637 --> 01:50:53.449]  They'll either move Kamala Harris into Dianne Feinstein's position, either removing by force, assassination, or persuasion the woman that currently was appointed there.
[01:50:54.370 --> 01:50:57.553]  Because Kamala Harris can't be the President of the United States.
[01:50:57.593 --> 01:50:59.115]  She's not a natural born citizen.
[01:50:59.656 --> 01:51:08.105]  They will put Gavin Newsom into the Vice Presidency and then they will assassinate Joe Biden to move Gavin Newsom automatically into that position.
[01:51:08.866 --> 01:51:28.879]  Thereby develop the requisite hysteria, paranoia, fear, and chaos that they can institute another Boston Marathon bombing, a martial law scenario, like they did last week with the, I suspect, fake false flag shooter in Maine, where everyone who spoke at the podium afterwards did not have a Maine accent.
[01:51:29.239 --> 01:51:30.520]  That was very interesting to me.
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:36.802]  So I do suspect they're going to assassinate Joe Biden, move Gavin Newsom into that position.
[01:51:37.222 --> 01:51:44.424]  That is why Christopher Wray is pre-positioning the mentality of people to be prepared for an assassination.
[01:51:44.805 --> 01:51:52.807]  We've said this, they're going to assassinate Biden and use that to try and suspend the 2024 election.
[01:51:53.247 --> 01:52:23.002]   And anyone that is of the opinion that the Constitution and the Republic and the rules and the laws forbid it, needs to recognize that the Constitution and our Republic and our notions of what the United States is and should always be has been shattered by these violent, lunatic, neocon, Zionist, Democrat, whatever you want to call them, who have usurped power, and rhinos included, and are part of this establishment.
[01:52:23.522 --> 01:52:35.246]  So they are pre-positioning with PSYOPs, both the demonization of the white Anglo-Saxon Trump supporting MAGA Republican individuals.
[01:52:35.727 --> 01:52:40.368]  They are pre-positioning Iran as the assassin of Joe Biden.
[01:52:40.808 --> 01:52:44.890]  I would suspect they even assassinate Zelensky, maybe doing it together.
[01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:49.131]  But they are going to be engaging in hostility.
[01:52:49.211 --> 01:53:02.174]  We will never have a free and fair election in this country again until this current government is by the constitutional means overthrown as the Declaration of Independence instructs.
[01:53:02.354 --> 01:53:14.037]  It says very specifically, when the government becomes tyrannical and destruction of your rights, it is the right and the duty of the people to overthrow such government and reconstitute one which seems fitting unto them.
[01:53:14.677 --> 01:53:18.718]  That is not a declaration of insurgency or revolution or rebellion.
[01:53:18.758 --> 01:53:28.521]  That is an affirmation of the constitutional prescription for a government that has become tyrannical and unconstitutional, that has defied our ability to live as a republic.
[01:53:28.681 --> 01:53:34.043]  And the founders defined it, and it's even enshrined in multiple state legislations and in state law.
[01:53:34.523 --> 01:53:36.504]  Like in New Hampshire, it's called right to revolt.
[01:53:37.324 --> 01:53:37.484]  Yes.
[01:53:38.737 --> 01:53:59.114]  Yes, and we see that in their facilitation of an invasion across the southern borders by violating the civil rights of every Texan, New Mexican, Arizonian, Californian, and other citizens of the United States by this organized planned invasion where they would bring in a third world population to turn America into a third world.
[01:53:59.614 --> 01:54:02.134]  and unleash all sorts of chaos.
[01:54:02.134 --> 01:54:09.373]   I do suspect the sleeper cells, which I personally do not suspect Iran is having the Machiavellian
[01:54:09.373 --> 01:54:13.953]   strategic long-term aggression against the United States because I've been to Iran several
[01:54:13.953 --> 01:54:15.453]  times and other countries in the Middle East.
[01:54:15.453 --> 01:54:17.333]  Well, they also know they get nuked off the map.
[01:54:17.333 --> 01:54:22.453]   What I'm saying is clearly, they've been saying the right wing's going to kill Biden and they
[01:54:22.453 --> 01:54:23.453]  need to get rid of him.
[01:54:23.453 --> 01:54:25.493]  Now they say Iran's going to kill Biden.
[01:54:25.493 --> 01:54:29.894]   I mean, to me, that is just, it's so obvious they're getting ready to kill him.
[01:54:29.894 --> 01:54:30.894]  And of course, I don't want that to happen.
[01:54:30.894 --> 01:54:33.693]   They're going to, and of course, and I'm glad you made all these great points, but can you
[01:54:33.693 --> 01:54:35.494]  digress to this?
[01:54:35.494 --> 01:54:40.973]   Having them say the right wing is going to work with Russia to hack and kill the power
[01:54:40.973 --> 01:54:45.333]   grid so we've got to shut the web off and only let you go to government sites, internet
[01:54:45.333 --> 01:54:49.254]  kill switch, to save it during the hack.
[01:54:19.422 --> 01:54:22.422]   you get uh... that they've been saying the right wings of the kill by many
[01:54:22.422 --> 01:54:25.983]   here in another state uh... iran's in a kill by them
[01:54:25.983 --> 01:54:28.942]   i mean to me that is just it's so obvious they're getting ready to kill
[01:54:28.942 --> 01:54:31.681]   him and of course i don't want that to happen they're gonna and
[01:54:31.681 --> 01:54:35.181]   of course and i'm glad you know is very poignant you digress to this
[01:54:35.181 --> 01:54:40.582]   having them say the right wing is going to work with russia to hack and
[01:54:40.582 --> 01:54:43.261]   kill the power grid so we've got to shut the web off and only
[01:54:43.261 --> 01:54:45.101]   let you go to government sites
[01:54:45.101 --> 01:54:50.502]   internet kill switch uh... to save it during the hack
[01:54:50.502 --> 01:54:54.001]   when iran or somebody would actually actually hit the power point
[01:54:54.001 --> 01:54:57.693]   you know two hundred plus points we can take the power off that way which the
[01:54:57.693 --> 01:55:00.181]   government's refusing to harden
[01:55:00.181 --> 01:55:06.181]   but the point of their now hyping this shows me they're thinking about not having a full world war three
[01:55:06.181 --> 01:55:10.181]   but maybe just cut the power off blame it on domestic groups assassinate biden
[01:55:10.181 --> 01:55:15.086]   as a pretext like venezuela to finally sew up the country Because they admit they want to sew it up.
[01:55:15.406 --> 01:55:21.794]  They're on MSNBC, CNN with former Army intelligence officers and PSYOP officers like yourself, but on the other guy's team.
[01:55:22.515 --> 01:55:28.297]  The bad guys keep saying, we need, like Homeland Security went after the Muslims, or during the Cold War, the Russians.
[01:55:28.737 --> 01:55:32.099]  The right-wingers are the enemy, we've got to outlaw them, we've got to arrest them en masse.
[01:55:32.139 --> 01:55:32.739]  Those are quotes.
[01:55:32.779 --> 01:55:38.401]  They are literally selling dictatorship, totalitarian rule, because they're so weak.
[01:55:38.781 --> 01:55:39.781]  So can you speak to that?
[01:55:40.201 --> 01:55:42.622]  And how we can navigate this and shut it down?
[01:55:42.642 --> 01:55:44.903]  I mean, more whistleblowers coming out?
[01:55:44.923 --> 01:55:46.904]  I mean, what do we do to stop these maniacs?
[01:55:48.516 --> 01:55:56.001]  Well, it all comes down to local control and local political influence and leaders are naturally rising to the top.
[01:55:56.121 --> 01:55:58.943]  Again, spiritual winds move political sails.
[01:55:59.023 --> 01:56:21.852]   The spiritual wind of your broadcasts and your speaking points and ours and others are moving people and they are igniting and And they learn by our example to conduct yourself as professionals, as very cool, level-headed, constitutional patriots.
[01:56:22.292 --> 01:56:24.373]  And that is infectious.
[01:56:24.693 --> 01:56:32.495]  And that's how you progress, is one town at a time, one county at a time, one area, state, region at a time.
[01:56:33.215 --> 01:56:46.613]  And solidify your areas of influence by controlling local government organizations through committees of safety, through individual militias, organizations, deputized citizens, veterans groups.
[01:56:47.074 --> 01:56:48.996]  You own and control where you live.
[01:56:49.837 --> 01:56:54.920]  And people have to get out from their college football Sunday scenarios.
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:57.701]  They need to come out from their... That's all over!
[01:56:58.041 --> 01:57:02.304]  Sorry I'm interrupting, but when we come back from break, you'll have the floor in the next 7-8 minutes.
[01:57:02.644 --> 01:57:07.226]  I want to describe what the world's going to be like if people don't get out of the Sunday scenario, that everything's still okay.
[01:57:07.306 --> 01:57:14.630]  I have family that's as smart as I am, and have done a lot more stuff than I have, and they still can't get out of gear of being in the Sunday scenario.
[01:57:14.650 --> 01:57:17.211]  And I'm like, why are you inviting me over for Sunday football?
[01:57:17.251 --> 01:57:18.392]  We need to go do something.
[01:57:18.692 --> 01:57:22.574]  We need to be knocking on doors and like, well, well, you're doing a good job.
[01:57:22.614 --> 01:57:23.355]  We're glad you're there.
[01:57:24.436 --> 01:57:26.477]  That's my own family that taught me all this.
[01:57:26.737 --> 01:57:30.179]  And they're it's just the party's over, folks.
[01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:33.721]  Yes, I couldn't agree more.
[01:57:34.221 --> 01:57:34.862]  Keep going, sorry.
[01:57:36.141 --> 01:57:36.941]  Well, you're right.
[01:57:36.981 --> 01:58:01.267]  The ending of the Sunday scenario where true leaders rise up and true leaders need to go to the churches as well as the Hindu temples and the Sikh temples and elsewhere and say, we're looking for a few good men and women to stand up and protect our children from this forced transgender castration, from eating bugs, from worshipping the climate as an environmental idol.
[01:58:01.727 --> 01:58:27.611]  We're looking to preserve our rights, our property, and our ability to live our lives as we define under God's rule and God's law and the natural commandments, who's with us, who in this church, who in this temple are willing to stand up and challenge any unconstitutional actions, ordinances, proclamations, statutes, whatever the towns are trying to say, whatever new lockdowns or vaccine mandates or anything else.
[01:58:27.692 --> 01:58:30.212]  And don't be surprised if that pops its ugly head up again.
[01:58:30.792 --> 01:58:38.417]  We need to be going out and recruiting people into the army of influencers and going into churches.
[01:58:38.457 --> 01:58:44.921]  You'll only find maybe three or ten people out of a hundred or three hundred, but that's all you want.
[01:58:44.981 --> 01:58:46.322]  You don't want a mass army.
[01:58:46.362 --> 01:58:47.403]  You want Gideon's army.
[01:58:47.443 --> 01:58:49.184]  You want special operations people.
[01:58:49.264 --> 01:59:10.915]   You want Incredible, talented, well-communicated, handsome, influential people from whatever organizations you could come that are dialed in and listen to Alex Jones, listen to other programs, go to GlobalFreedomTV.com, that listen to Mike Adams, that are compartmentalizing all of this material to arrange a strategic map.
[01:59:11.736 --> 01:59:15.837]  of how the country is going to unfold, how the bad guys are going to react.
[01:59:15.857 --> 01:59:16.258]  That's right.
[01:59:16.298 --> 01:59:18.999]  Admit we're in a war, and admit it's intensifying.
[01:59:19.059 --> 01:59:22.860]  People have to get out of the Sunday fun time crap.
[01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:25.981]  Because, folks, everybody's going to figure it out soon.
[01:59:26.201 --> 01:59:27.682]  You're not going to have money to do that anyways.
[01:59:27.742 --> 01:59:28.962]  I mean, we're going into hell.
[01:59:29.162 --> 01:59:30.603]  And I'm not trying to scare people, folks.
[01:59:31.023 --> 01:59:31.483]  It's here.
[01:59:32.923 --> 01:59:33.504]  It's going down.
[01:59:33.524 --> 01:59:36.825]  It's like if a helicopter's engine fails and you say, brace for impact.
[01:59:38.103 --> 01:59:41.524]  The engine's off, it's going down, and we better get ready.
[01:59:42.625 --> 02:00:00.292]  Well, Alex, a good analogy is we have been sitting on the good ship, you know, lollipop, if you will, the Princess Cruise loveboat, swinging on a hammock, sipping a pina colada, while the Democrats and the RINOs and the globalists and these neocons have been at the helm of the ship.
[02:00:00.352 --> 02:00:01.292]  They've been driving us.
[02:00:01.873 --> 02:00:04.354]  So they have driven us to the reef.
[02:00:05.074 --> 02:00:10.236]  And we're now feeling the rocks starting to scrape the bottom of our belly of our ship.
[02:00:10.656 --> 02:00:14.677]  And pretty soon, those rocks are going to rip out big chunks.
[02:00:15.078 --> 02:00:22.480]  That's inevitable because of their economic policies, because of their foreign policy, because of their endless war policy, because of 9-11.
[02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:25.121]  And that all is a layering.
[02:00:25.201 --> 02:00:27.222]  It's straws upon the camel's back.
[02:00:27.842 --> 02:00:32.526]  And it has to break in order for things to be resurrected.
[02:00:32.947 --> 02:00:34.748]  Again, an awakening, a renaissance.
[02:00:35.249 --> 02:00:50.102]  But people need to be prepared for the inevitable ripping out and crash that will occur because of the things that have been done since 2001 onward, so that we can be prepared to adapt and grow out of it.
[02:00:50.282 --> 02:00:57.107]   I have no doubt that the American character Is, is one of the strongest, uh, brightest characters on planet Earth.
[02:00:57.207 --> 02:00:59.108]  I found that when I've gone to foreign countries.
[02:00:59.529 --> 02:01:03.051]  They love the United States, the Americans' charisma and warmth.
[02:01:03.131 --> 02:01:05.533]  And it's not gone, it's just been asleep.
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:06.760]  That's right.
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:07.521]  That's right.
[02:01:07.581 --> 02:01:08.221]  It's not gone.
[02:01:08.581 --> 02:01:09.342]  It's inevitable.
[02:01:09.402 --> 02:01:12.084]  God has blessed this country with an anointing.
[02:01:12.524 --> 02:01:17.967]  He's given us the greatest personality and the greatest culture and the greatest history on earth.
[02:01:18.027 --> 02:01:21.430]  It's been defiled and corrupted and perverted since 1990.
[02:01:21.890 --> 02:01:28.734]  They've gone on this wild cannibalistic crusade to try and gobble up the world and dominate its natural resources.
[02:01:29.134 --> 02:01:31.396]  And that has inevitably blown back upon us.
[02:01:31.496 --> 02:01:36.378]   Our sanctions against Russia, And China and all sorts of other countries have blown back on us.
[02:01:36.858 --> 02:01:50.123]  We've hit maniacal levels of self-destruction and suicide by blowing things up like the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that inevitably is going to lead to a collapse of the European regimes and, you know, an awakening of Europe.
[02:01:50.583 --> 02:01:52.524]  So all of these things have happened.
[02:01:52.564 --> 02:01:54.925]  By the way, you said that when they blew up Nord Stream.
[02:01:56.150 --> 02:02:01.451]  A year ago, and now they admit that Europe is electing anti-globalist right-wingers everywhere.
[02:02:01.752 --> 02:02:04.072]  From Germany to Spain to Italy.
[02:02:05.132 --> 02:02:06.593]  They are, and they are going to.
[02:02:06.673 --> 02:02:13.655]  Look, I say it with a cold surgical detachment as a battlefield officer looking at the map saying, here's how the dominoes are going to fall.
[02:02:14.355 --> 02:02:22.797]  And they are going to fall in a way that aligns the newly elected governments of Europe into more of an inclination with Russia.
[02:02:23.357 --> 02:02:28.803]  A reunification with Russia, like the prodigal son returning to the prodigal father.
[02:02:29.243 --> 02:02:36.010]  Not out of anything other than necessary energy and food needs and protection needs.
[02:02:36.110 --> 02:02:40.915]  Russia's Duma has already declared Russia is the safest country in Europe.
[02:02:41.296 --> 02:02:45.200]  And Europe soon will realize that and come rushing back to Russia.
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:03:11.203]   That's a prediction that the Muslim-African infection, infestation, whatever you want to call it, that has gone into Europe for the past six, seven years is going to erupt into a turbulent social Disruptive storm that is going to tribalize Europe and they're going to look at the United States increasingly as responsible for this.
[02:03:11.683 --> 02:03:18.807]  They're certainly not going to trust any word that comes out of the current regime of neocons, rhinos, Democrats.
[02:03:19.708 --> 02:03:21.689]  They are going to incline more towards Russia.
[02:03:21.969 --> 02:03:23.230]  Let's talk about the dominoes.
[02:03:23.290 --> 02:03:24.150]  Stay right there.
[02:03:24.210 --> 02:03:25.851]  Scott Bennett, incredible information.
[02:03:26.311 --> 02:03:28.852]  People check his website out right now, his books, everything.
[02:03:28.872 --> 02:03:30.573]  GlobalFreedomTV.com.
[02:03:30.593 --> 02:03:31.634]  GlobalFreedomTV.com.
[02:03:32.094 --> 02:03:32.834]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:03:32.974 --> 02:03:35.295]  And folks, we're not playing games here, okay?
[02:03:35.655 --> 02:03:36.396]  It's going down.
[02:03:36.456 --> 02:03:36.956]  This is it.
[02:03:37.656 --> 02:03:38.397]  Get right with God.
[02:03:38.497 --> 02:03:39.077]  This is it.
[02:03:39.457 --> 02:03:40.618]  This is the big one, okay?
[02:03:40.638 --> 02:03:42.299]  Not gonna have to wait long now.
[02:03:43.799 --> 02:03:45.340]  Scott Bennett, Ph.D., U.S.
[02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:49.082]  Army Special Operations Officer, psychological warfare expert, is our guest.
[02:03:50.322 --> 02:03:51.343]  Well, this is a big one.
[02:03:52.103 --> 02:03:52.904]  It's not just me.
[02:03:52.984 --> 02:03:55.086]  It's Steve Mannin.
[02:03:55.186 --> 02:03:57.608]  It's hell, even Kevin McCarthy.
[02:03:58.449 --> 02:04:00.170]  It's Joe Rogan.
[02:04:00.250 --> 02:04:05.514]  It's everybody saying this is the last election.
[02:04:07.121 --> 02:04:08.322]  The globalists know they're losing.
[02:04:08.342 --> 02:04:09.922]  The numbers show they're losing all over the world.
[02:04:10.402 --> 02:04:14.864]  But I mentioned European countries electing Prime Ministers and Presidents and Parliamentary leaders.
[02:04:15.044 --> 02:04:15.864]  I only mentioned a few.
[02:04:15.904 --> 02:04:18.285]  I mean, it's not just Germany.
[02:04:18.325 --> 02:04:19.665]  It's not just France.
[02:04:19.705 --> 02:04:21.906]  It's not just Italy.
[02:04:22.266 --> 02:04:26.348]  It's not just... It's Sweden and Greece and the UK.
[02:04:27.188 --> 02:04:29.069]  It's two-to-one patriots getting elected.
[02:04:29.089 --> 02:04:30.129]  Look at Argentina.
[02:04:30.549 --> 02:04:33.110]  They have a runoff, but the patriot's going to win, so they've indicted him.
[02:04:34.716 --> 02:04:37.178]  And now the headlines are on Infowars.com.
[02:04:37.518 --> 02:04:42.120]  The Justice Department for Trump violating a gag order saying you guys are corrupt.
[02:04:42.161 --> 02:04:43.061]  That's his right to say that.
[02:04:43.261 --> 02:04:44.462]  They're all over the news attacking him.
[02:04:44.842 --> 02:04:45.963]  They want jail time now.
[02:04:47.813 --> 02:04:49.354]  So we'll be getting to those.
[02:04:49.374 --> 02:04:50.695]  They're printing the articles right now.
[02:04:51.536 --> 02:04:52.177]  Putin has come out.
[02:04:52.197 --> 02:04:56.560]  There's a big article on Infowars that says the U.S.-run system is falling apart.
[02:04:56.600 --> 02:05:05.108]  Well, it's the globalists who are attacking us domestically, making us fall apart, while they try to make the rest of the world fall apart, so BlackRock can come in and buy it all up.
[02:05:05.188 --> 02:05:06.149]  That's why they want you poor.
[02:05:06.169 --> 02:05:10.212]  That's why they did the lockdowns and the controls to double their assets.
[02:05:10.813 --> 02:05:16.866]   The American-run world is refresh on that. The American run world is falling to
[02:05:16.866 --> 02:05:22.855]   pieces. Main takeaway from Putin's security meeting. And now Putin's beginning to turn. He's
[02:05:22.855 --> 02:05:27.136]   been neutral against Israel and saying this is wrong. Now Erdogan in Turkey is saying
[02:05:27.136 --> 02:05:31.586]   we'll go to war with Israel. We'll invade Israel. I'm not an enemy of Israel. But Israel's a
[02:05:31.586 --> 02:05:36.176]   diverse group of people. There was clearly a false flag there. Hamas attacked, but there
[02:05:36.176 --> 02:05:37.996]  was a stand down.
[02:05:38.066 --> 02:05:40.108]  The majority of Israelis, up to 90%, believe that.
[02:05:41.230 --> 02:05:43.132]  So what's really going on here, big picture?
[02:05:43.532 --> 02:05:44.754]  How do these wars starting?
[02:05:45.094 --> 02:05:48.298]  Who do you think's really behind what happened in Israel, sir?
[02:05:50.438 --> 02:05:52.139]  Well, they're certainly a false flag.
[02:05:52.199 --> 02:05:54.361]  I think Netanyahu miscalculated.
[02:05:54.381 --> 02:05:59.545]  I think their plans and their designs were in grotesque error.
[02:05:59.605 --> 02:06:04.548]  They didn't expect the world to turn as quickly as they have against this.
[02:06:05.049 --> 02:06:15.937]  The seven hours are indicative of a planned intelligence blackout to facilitate the necessary trauma and outrage to justify an obliteration of Gaza.
[02:06:16.457 --> 02:06:22.198]  And as I've said, turn it into Maui beachfront property where the Greater Israel Project would expand.
[02:06:22.718 --> 02:06:26.579]  And instead, it has, as I said before, it was going to happen.
[02:06:26.619 --> 02:06:35.900]  You have created the bridges and the connections between the Shia and the Sunni Islamic civilizations with Turkey and Iran.
[02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:42.502]  And by the way, just to interrupt you, I just remembered the last time you were on The Time Before Last, you predicted an Israeli war.
[02:06:42.842 --> 02:06:43.542]  I remember that.
[02:06:43.722 --> 02:06:44.322]  How did you do that?
[02:06:45.854 --> 02:06:59.164]  Well, we knew that the Israeli expansionary Oden Anon plan was exciting and animating an aggression and an animosity, and that's precisely what has happened.
[02:06:59.304 --> 02:07:04.227]  You've created the opportunity for North Africa, Egypt, Yemen, Iran, Iraq.
[02:07:06.129 --> 02:07:15.974]  Syria, Jordan, Turkey to unite in an ideological rescue the Palestinian Marshall Plan humanitarian mission.
[02:07:16.614 --> 02:07:33.423]  And I did this in the army and I predicted and I presented to the Obama administration that their agenda was driving the Islamic countries away from any rapprochement with the United States, any finding of commonality.
[02:07:33.483 --> 02:07:42.529]   And when I did that, I found myself curiously indicted for making a false statement on a housing form that was completely fraudulent.
[02:07:42.589 --> 02:07:55.978]  But that came after I exposed the Obama administration's policies in the army for expunging and expelling white Christians from the military and homosexualizing it.
[02:07:56.078 --> 02:07:59.440]  Which we now see, you wrote a book about it many years ago, now that's their main mission.
[02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:06.524]  So, obviously Obama and his controllers, the same people that run The Economist Magazine, that's their mouthpiece, the Rothschilds, they're not stupid.
[02:08:06.544 --> 02:08:12.507]  They knew when they funded Muslim Brotherhood and overthrew our allies in Egypt and did all that, it was going to lead to a wider war later.
[02:08:12.527 --> 02:08:14.648]  They got really mad that Trump stopped it.
[02:08:15.449 --> 02:08:16.509]  What is their plan?
[02:08:16.829 --> 02:08:20.331]  Bringing in all the Islamists, making them leftists, organizing them into these groups.
[02:08:20.892 --> 02:08:24.754]  What are they planning to do with this nightmare combination?
[02:08:25.816 --> 02:08:35.480]  Well, the vast majority of the Islamists are very easy to persuade because they're more natural law individuals believing in family and traditional values and such.
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:43.443]  And you talk with others who've been to Iran and elsewhere, Mike Maloof, Phil Giraldi, colleagues of mine that we were over there at a conference.
[02:08:44.023 --> 02:08:51.645]  So they are easy to influence, yet there are the rabid left ones that they'll bring in and use.
[02:08:51.885 --> 02:08:57.266]  But for the most part, I have no fear because when we communicate with them, we have an impact.
[02:08:57.446 --> 02:09:03.587]  Now, I wanted to mention one thing too, Alex, you said their prosecution of Trump.
[02:09:03.987 --> 02:09:07.747]   It's very important for people to realize, and we predicted this too,
[02:09:07.747 --> 02:09:09.826]  they would put a gag order on Trump.
[02:09:09.826 --> 02:09:11.865]  Then they would say he violated it.
[02:09:11.865 --> 02:09:13.787]  Then they would imprison him.
[02:09:13.787 --> 02:09:16.146]  Then they would attempt to assassinate him.
[02:09:16.146 --> 02:09:21.025]   And if they do assassinate Trump in prison, saying he violated a gag order,
[02:09:21.025 --> 02:09:25.025]   saying perhaps he had a heart attack or fell down the stairs or Epstein'd himself.
[02:09:25.025 --> 02:09:27.787]   Then they assassinate Biden and blame it on us to start the Civil War.
[02:09:27.787 --> 02:09:30.706]  Yes, you could see that scenario.
[02:09:30.775 --> 02:09:53.607]  They execute Trump in a gag order and they execute Biden and then Gavin Newsom declares, as the Manchurian candidate he is, everything is suspended and then ends the United States of American Republic into the communist, atheistic, woke state of madness that these Democrat neocon types are wanting to facilitate.
[02:09:53.947 --> 02:09:55.708]  It'll never go that far, of course.
[02:09:55.928 --> 02:09:56.348]  No, I agree.
[02:09:56.368 --> 02:09:57.529]  So they're making a move.
[02:09:57.729 --> 02:09:58.970]  How do you see it unfolding?
[02:09:59.010 --> 02:10:02.072]  Because they need stealth of the public being ignorant with this to work.
[02:10:02.412 --> 02:10:06.854]  Just like they tried new lockdowns in the last few months, and we saw them try it, but it failed.
[02:10:07.575 --> 02:10:09.376]  They've got the opposite of the Midas touch right now.
[02:10:09.396 --> 02:10:11.017]  Everything they touch turns to, you know what?
[02:10:12.742 --> 02:10:31.912]  I'm watching for a combination of false flags and events that are being positioned to blame on foreign actors within the United States and trying to use those to accelerate a martial law shutdown.
[02:10:32.272 --> 02:10:41.138]   Remember the neocon democrat mentality is already stunted and lobotomized to a certain degree.
[02:10:41.238 --> 02:10:49.887]  If they've all got the COVID-19 vaccine, then you really know that they're retarded and lobotomized and their mental degeneration is going to quicken over the next year.
[02:10:50.348 --> 02:11:00.218]  But remember, that increasing desperation and hysteria and paranoia drives emotional, reckless actions and decisions.
[02:11:00.738 --> 02:11:19.840]  So, we need to be prepared to recognize the hysteria, the recklessness, the mental degeneration that is occurring in many parts of our government, and not try and rationalize it, but recognizing it as a self-inflicted slow suicide wound.
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:22.863]  So I suspect there's going to be false flags.
[02:11:22.923 --> 02:11:31.711]  I suspect this Israeli situation they are going to, you know, try and justify attacks within the United States saying it was done over there.
[02:11:31.791 --> 02:11:32.592]  Let's not forget Ukraine.
[02:11:35.085 --> 02:11:38.267]  Ukraine, I predicted, was going to be over by October 31st.
[02:11:38.327 --> 02:11:53.575]  I think today is October 31st, and the pivot point is going to be igniting Ukrainian disenfranchised individuals into committing alleged terrorist attacks in Europe and possibly the United States.
[02:11:53.895 --> 02:11:57.516]  That's the next card of Al Qaeda.
[02:11:57.597 --> 02:12:01.099]   Absolutely, and it's like somebody flipped a switch in the last Three weeks.
[02:12:01.599 --> 02:12:03.020]  Now Ukraine's off the news.
[02:12:03.081 --> 02:12:03.881]  It's out of the news.
[02:12:04.622 --> 02:12:07.205]  Netanyahu told Zelensky don't come to Israel.
[02:12:08.789 --> 02:12:09.850]  Yeah, I think.
[02:12:09.990 --> 02:12:22.560]  You know, the thing is, as much as the desperation of the globalists are to ignite conflicts and continue this inferno, they're running out of fuel, because the hearts and minds of people are not receptive to it.
[02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:24.682]  Look at the American people.
[02:12:25.202 --> 02:12:32.348]  No one believes and trusts the mainstream media, and no one wants to engage in a war in the Middle East or a war against Russia.
[02:12:33.008 --> 02:12:39.171]  There's not going to be a draft, yet the Biden administration and their handlers are going to try and institute a draft.
[02:12:39.291 --> 02:12:42.273]  They're going to try and draft Americans into these wars.
[02:12:42.753 --> 02:12:48.276]  And again, their miscalculation is that Americans are going to accept whatever they say in Washington.
[02:12:48.456 --> 02:13:11.188]  Well that's right, just to back you up, to interrupt, the new Speaker of the House, when you're taking on what you think of him, there's some mixed signals, but he's been going from saying he wasn't for wars and wasn't for Ukraine funding, now he loves it, he said in an interview Sunday, we have to put on the national news, we played it, he said, well we do need to get ready to send troops in and have a wider war in the Middle East, so they're actually selling that.
[02:13:13.087 --> 02:13:22.952]  I predicted three weeks ago that they would engage in a Jessica Lynch hostage rescue situation, and they did exactly that on Monday.
[02:13:23.833 --> 02:13:27.835]  They engaged in a rescue of an Israeli female soldier.
[02:13:28.415 --> 02:13:29.516]  They didn't give details.
[02:13:29.596 --> 02:13:30.957]  They just say they rescued her.
[02:13:31.657 --> 02:13:34.899]  And that is meant to be part of a larger PSYOP.
[02:13:34.979 --> 02:13:37.381]  They did it with Jessica Lynch in 2003.
[02:13:37.881 --> 02:13:43.124]  So it's interesting to see all of these psychological operation triggers are now being pulled.
[02:13:44.345 --> 02:13:55.652]  They are going to engage in most likely a Gulf of Tonkin situation where they sink an American ship that's already been decommissioned and ready to be sent to the junkyard most likely.
[02:13:56.132 --> 02:14:14.111]   But a Gulf of Tonkin sinking of an American ship By an Israeli submarine or something that they claim was done by Russia or Iran will trigger the draft it will trigger the larger movement and the Congress and your house speaker you mentioned.
[02:14:14.611 --> 02:14:40.192]  You know, all of these people, I must say, Alex, the moment this Israeli thing unfolded, and I think it was a complete pre-ordained false flag, it was fascinating to me to see people that I agree with on many levels, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Jim Jordan, Matt Gaetz, I like all of the things that they've said about Trump and elsewhere and conservatism, but they instantly jumped on board of this endless funding and military support for Israel.
[02:14:40.852 --> 02:14:57.259]  And committing us to, you know, taking everything that went to Ukraine suddenly to Israel and almost automatically lining up for a war draft situation instead of saying, hold on, let's get control of this situation.
[02:14:57.379 --> 02:14:58.680]  Let's be a mediator.
[02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:00.621]  Let's be what America is supposed to be.
[02:15:00.641 --> 02:15:05.643]  And for there to be a draft situation, who do they entice to join the war first?
[02:15:05.763 --> 02:15:06.143]  Iran?
[02:15:06.183 --> 02:15:07.564]  Or how do those dominoes fall?
[02:15:09.028 --> 02:15:11.230]  Well, they're going to go after Iran.
[02:15:11.390 --> 02:15:16.494]  They're going to blame Iran for a false flag event, possibly in the Strait of Hormuz.
[02:15:17.395 --> 02:15:23.520]  And they, again, miscalculate because Iran has incredible missile technology, and others will confirm this.
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:25.242]  Scott Ritter, Doug McGregor.
[02:15:26.163 --> 02:15:27.123]  I've been to Iran.
[02:15:27.164 --> 02:15:28.044]  I've seen the missiles.
[02:15:28.084 --> 02:15:29.526]  I've seen their whole situation.
[02:15:29.606 --> 02:15:31.447]  I mean, it's quite impressive.
[02:15:31.467 --> 02:15:32.028]  Let me ask you this.
[02:15:32.048 --> 02:15:37.933]   From my intel many years ago, and I'm going to leave it at that, I talked to an individual that was working there.
[02:15:38.473 --> 02:15:42.836]  They said, look, the Iranians don't have a delivery system yet, but they've got atomic bombs.
[02:15:43.537 --> 02:15:46.159]  And this was like 15 years ago, and I've been attacked for saying that.
[02:15:46.559 --> 02:15:52.444]  I just went off a source that's never lied to me that said that the Pentagon has scanner systems, and they caught them moving some of them.
[02:15:52.965 --> 02:16:00.090]   And when they're in a truck moving them, they're able to scan the signature And it was fissile material for an atomic bomb.
[02:16:00.130 --> 02:16:02.092]  Yeah, primitive by today's standards, but they had it.
[02:16:02.572 --> 02:16:11.639]  And then the jacketing, as you know, is just plastic explosives or a plutonium bullet that goes in, and they can certainly get a piece of plutonium to fire into it.
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:15.422]  So yeah, they've got like a 1945-style bomb.
[02:16:16.063 --> 02:16:19.185]  What did you hear when you were stationed over there in Army Intelligence?
[02:16:19.705 --> 02:16:22.808]  Was that wrong when I was told, or does Iran have atomic weapons?
[02:16:23.803 --> 02:16:32.013]  Well, they don't have a designing capability or a manufacturing capability, but North Korea has certainly transported materials.
[02:16:32.113 --> 02:16:33.395]  And Pakistan has a bunch?
[02:16:34.416 --> 02:16:35.718]  Oh yes, Pakistan has a bunch.
[02:16:35.738 --> 02:16:38.522]  So I'm just asking, did you ever hear that Iran really has weapons?
[02:16:40.451 --> 02:16:44.873]  Uh, well, I've got to be careful what I say and what I don't, because TSSEI clearance.
[02:16:45.173 --> 02:16:45.733]  I got it.
[02:16:45.753 --> 02:16:46.373]  Okay, okay.
[02:16:46.653 --> 02:16:48.754]  Well, I've been told they've got an atomic weapon.
[02:16:49.354 --> 02:16:53.996]  I don't see Iran using an atomic weapon against the United States or Israel.
[02:16:54.036 --> 02:16:56.076]  They have a superior kinetic capability.
[02:16:56.116 --> 02:16:59.498]  And again, strategically, they don't want to die.
[02:16:59.558 --> 02:17:00.698]  They don't want to be annihilated.
[02:17:00.778 --> 02:17:02.919]  Sure, because the way they do it is that they had a boat.
[02:17:03.414 --> 02:17:06.614]   you know let's say the Mediterranean and they floated in and detonated by Tel
[02:17:06.614 --> 02:17:10.534]  Aviv. Tehran's going to get flattened within 30 minutes.
[02:17:10.534 --> 02:17:15.253]   Yes, yes, and they know that. Then what about a nuclear false flag then?
[02:17:15.253 --> 02:17:19.734]  Yeah, they will, they will possibly.
[02:17:17.971 --> 02:17:26.636]  I've seen scenarios where they've detonated a ship and I suspect it is going to be in the Mediterranean and they detonate a nuclear annihilation of ships.
[02:17:26.676 --> 02:17:35.121]  Remember the old video of their original testing of nuclear weapons where the bomb is blown up in the sea and it engulfs all of these ships?
[02:17:35.321 --> 02:17:48.410]   I think that is possibly Their scenario, and it's very easy to blame it on Iran, Hezbollah, Syria, Russia, China, or all of the above, because it's decimated.
[02:17:48.810 --> 02:17:56.435]  But I do anticipate a Gulf of Tonkin moment, because their long-term effort, as you said before, is to sew up the United States.
[02:17:56.515 --> 02:18:18.311]   And they have to do that by commanding obedience without question, and hysterically guilt-tripping Every citizen into bowing their heads, putting on their chains and marching towards the military draft and what they think will be a control of the American citizenry.
[02:18:18.451 --> 02:18:22.073]  Remember, they use fear to control Americans.
[02:18:22.133 --> 02:18:31.520]  And that's why they can't control, you know, Alex Jones's audience, the white Anglo-Saxon Trump supporting conservative Republicans believing in traditional family values and God.
[02:18:31.580 --> 02:18:32.521]  We don't have fear.
[02:18:33.334 --> 02:18:37.395]  We're owners of this country, not peasants, not serfs, not servants.
[02:18:37.595 --> 02:18:40.656]  We're owners of this country, as our forefathers were.
[02:18:41.196 --> 02:18:44.757]  And that's something the Democrats and the neocons hate.
[02:18:45.217 --> 02:18:48.318]  They think when they're in control, everyone else is a slave.
[02:18:48.358 --> 02:18:51.979]  Well, do you remember in 2015, Obama did that martial law drill?
[02:18:51.999 --> 02:18:57.801]  It'll pop in my head in a minute, where it was for the United States, but it later got declassified.
[02:18:57.821 --> 02:19:09.843]   The Pentagon said, we're worried About traditional American values, and for whatever reason, you know, they said, for whatever reason, they mentioned the Scots in the report.
[02:19:10.524 --> 02:19:14.406]  Because, you know, if you looked at the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, Scots were kind of the leaders of it.
[02:19:15.007 --> 02:19:18.409]  Of course, now the Scots have been captured by the Muslims and have become the opposite cucks.
[02:19:18.429 --> 02:19:19.209]  I'm not bashing Scots.
[02:19:19.229 --> 02:19:20.150]  I'm a little Scot myself.
[02:19:20.170 --> 02:19:23.172]  But everybody knows, you know, Scottish guys are pretty tough.
[02:19:23.212 --> 02:19:26.314]  On average, even if they don't live in Scotland anymore, they've got the genetics for warriors.
[02:19:26.934 --> 02:19:32.856]  But they said there's something about the Anglo-Saxon view that is so rebellious.
[02:19:33.676 --> 02:19:35.816]  We don't think that our revolution was the first, folks.
[02:19:35.836 --> 02:19:38.217]  It all came out of England, it came out of Scotland, it came out of Ireland.
[02:19:38.677 --> 02:19:44.879]  And so they really fear that revolutionary Renaissance spirit that does come out of the British Isles, and they actually say what you're saying.
[02:19:44.899 --> 02:19:55.006]   And of course, you were in psychological warfare, I guess you were briefed on that, or you later learned that yourself, but they really do fear If Europe stands up, because that's where everybody wanted to come here.
[02:19:55.086 --> 02:20:05.223]  We invented the ideas that everybody wanted to follow that came out of hundreds and hundreds of years, what, a thousand years of civil war between warring Brits, Scots, and Irish.
[02:20:05.343 --> 02:20:05.623]  Go ahead.
[02:20:06.940 --> 02:20:08.261]  Well, I was born in Scotland.
[02:20:08.321 --> 02:20:09.582]  I was born in Edinburgh.
[02:20:09.662 --> 02:20:10.983]  My mother's side are Scottish.
[02:20:11.043 --> 02:20:12.224]  My other side are German.
[02:20:12.405 --> 02:20:22.333]  And I can say they are legitimate warriors and they have fought independence for over a thousand years from King Fergus to current.
[02:20:22.453 --> 02:20:30.239]  And they have certainly been controlled in the last 20 years and the whole British system is broken down.
[02:20:30.279 --> 02:20:36.605]   But you're right, Alex, that spirit Of independent radiance and buoyancy and fearlessness and confidence.
[02:20:36.765 --> 02:20:48.494]  Again, it's about the righteous are as bold as a lion and the roaring heroism that animates and again is spoken through the spiritual winds of orators and people that influence others.
[02:20:48.995 --> 02:20:53.699]  That's something the Democrats and the RINOs and these neocons do not have.
[02:20:53.739 --> 02:20:54.760]  They cannot contain.
[02:20:55.220 --> 02:21:02.467]  Victoria Nuland and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and Biden, they're all muppets.
[02:21:02.707 --> 02:21:06.091]  They're all incapable of any natural leadership.
[02:21:06.131 --> 02:21:14.719]  And that's why they fear masculine men, whether they're black or white, Asian, Hispanic, because they admit in the Pentagon reports, we're not worried about terrorists, we're worried about interesting men.
[02:21:14.759 --> 02:21:16.261]  They're worried about potential leaders.
[02:21:17.366 --> 02:21:17.786]  That's right.
[02:21:18.046 --> 02:21:18.546]  That's right.
[02:21:18.586 --> 02:21:21.268]  Because strong leaders are gentlemen.
[02:21:21.388 --> 02:21:23.048]  Strong leaders are confident.
[02:21:23.168 --> 02:21:33.032]  Strong leaders are about growing the good, the true, and the beautiful for the elevation of all people around them, regardless of their ethnicity or their color or their race.
[02:21:33.252 --> 02:21:36.934]  I had friends when I was in the Army who were black, Hispanic, Asian.
[02:21:36.954 --> 02:21:52.503]   There's no difference when you're united by your oath to the Constitution, which is simply an affirmation that you are going to protect Your rights, your property, your destiny given to you by God and the Constitution is the law of the land that recognizes it.
[02:21:52.903 --> 02:21:56.246]  The Constitution protects your rights against tyrannical government.
[02:21:56.626 --> 02:22:04.553]  And when you swear an oath and every veteran is bound by that oath, every veteran is committed until they die to defend the Constitution.
[02:22:04.613 --> 02:22:08.596]  Not the government, not the president, not the governor, not the Congress.
[02:22:09.176 --> 02:22:29.765]  The Constitution of the United States, which is an implicit recognition of your rights to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, the ownership of property, your right to keep and bear arms, your right to associate with others, your right to petition the government for the redress of grievances, your right to live life free from a vaccine or a mask.
[02:22:30.285 --> 02:22:34.268]  No one has a right to stick a needle in your arm or fire you if you refuse it.
[02:22:34.749 --> 02:22:41.114]  These are the rights, these are the truths that veterans and other oath takers have sworn to uphold.
[02:22:41.134 --> 02:22:41.555]  Absolutely.
[02:22:41.595 --> 02:22:46.839]  So with the rise of the robots, they want to take out the men, and they want to start by demonizing white men to say we're the devil.
[02:22:46.859 --> 02:22:52.424]  And then they've got one group of men out of the way in the West who are used to rights and freedoms, whose ancestors fought for it.
[02:22:52.704 --> 02:22:54.265]  They believe it'll be easy to take out the rest.
[02:22:54.305 --> 02:23:03.353]   But I notice, understanding sociology, You were talking about the Sikhs and also the Hindus, from just seeing the news and studying it and talking to people on the street.
[02:23:04.334 --> 02:23:09.578]  That's another group, because they've been fighting the Muslims for a thousand years, that is very attuned to what we're saying.
[02:23:09.598 --> 02:23:18.306]  That was very astute, you said that, because I've not seen it anywhere, but I've separately noticed they are the... I mean, I'm huge in India, and they love us over there.
[02:23:18.346 --> 02:23:19.507]  They really resonate with it.
[02:23:20.686 --> 02:23:24.549]  Well, remember the movie, Revenge of the Nerds?
[02:23:24.609 --> 02:23:27.452]  And yes, I admit the 80s were the best decade in time.
[02:23:28.352 --> 02:23:42.504]  But remember that film, Revenge of the Nerds, where they had a fraternity scene where the Indian and the Asian and these guys are sitting around, you know, isolated, alone, not part of the party, not talking to the cute cheerleaders, not part of the football team, but yet they're there.
[02:23:43.124 --> 02:23:46.787]  That's a very similar scenario to what we have in the United States.
[02:23:46.827 --> 02:23:57.854]  The Hindus, the Sikhs, the Vietnamese, the Asians, the Chinese, not so much the Russian immigrants, to an extent the Hispanics, but they've all been kind of isolated by the Republicans.
[02:23:57.894 --> 02:24:11.303]  We've not gone over and courted them and invited them into the party and warmed their hearts and almost transfused our joy, optimism, and buoyancy into them.
[02:24:13.065 --> 02:24:15.051]  Second generation ones are hungry to join us.
[02:24:15.292 --> 02:24:17.198]  They want, they are trying to join us.
[02:24:18.203 --> 02:24:27.008]  They are, and the Democrats try and isolate, split, and say, Republicans and Conservatives are all a bunch of Nazis and they, you know, hate each other and they hate you.
[02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:28.269]  And that's a lie.
[02:24:28.429 --> 02:24:29.270]  That's false.
[02:24:29.430 --> 02:24:36.414]  That's where we need to go to these people and say, and there are leaders in the community waiting to be courted.
[02:24:36.434 --> 02:24:42.478]  They're waiting to open the door when you knock on it and say, hey, here is Alex Jones coming to the party.
[02:24:42.978 --> 02:24:43.218]  Right?
[02:24:43.298 --> 02:24:51.126]  You go to these people and say, Donald Trump, Americans, Republicans, conservatives, property, traditional family values.
[02:24:51.426 --> 02:24:53.308]  We all agree on these things.
[02:24:53.788 --> 02:25:00.634]  We all agree we don't want our children having their penises cut off or their breasts cut off or hormone blockers stuffed down their throat.
[02:25:00.995 --> 02:25:02.016]  Right, Mr. Indian?
[02:25:02.116 --> 02:25:03.297]  Right, Mr. Vietnamese?
[02:25:03.417 --> 02:25:04.318]  Right, Mr. Sikh?
[02:25:04.678 --> 02:25:05.699]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:25:05.799 --> 02:25:06.139]  Great.
[02:25:06.239 --> 02:25:07.160]  Welcome to the party.
[02:25:07.240 --> 02:25:08.782]  We are all standing together.
[02:25:09.042 --> 02:25:10.327]  That's what the globalists fear.
[02:25:10.688 --> 02:25:14.461]  In closing, Yemen, an Iranian vassal state, has declared war on Israel.
[02:25:14.581 --> 02:25:15.364]  How big a deal is that?
[02:25:17.019 --> 02:25:30.308]  Well, in the Declaration of War, they're positioning themselves to allow their own indigenous people to do a massive infiltration into Gaza for rescuing operations.
[02:25:30.368 --> 02:25:38.734]  I think it's meant to influence the Israelis to cease and desist their annihilation campaign and move towards a political settlement.
[02:25:39.294 --> 02:25:44.618]  And the United States should be quickening that and saying, we need to stop the hostilities.
[02:25:44.638 --> 02:25:46.339]  But instead, the globalists wanted to get out of control.
[02:25:46.459 --> 02:25:46.630]  Yeah.
[02:25:47.216 --> 02:25:47.576]  They do.
[02:25:47.876 --> 02:25:49.376]  They do want it to get out of control.
[02:25:49.416 --> 02:25:53.737]  But, you know, we need to attack this on a variety of fronts.
[02:25:53.817 --> 02:26:09.941]  Number one, we need to recognize they're trying to facilitate an overthrow and insurrection in the United States in martial law by creating external conditions that they can then metastasize into the United States across the southern border as terrorist operations.
[02:26:10.741 --> 02:26:12.501]  They may blame it on Russia.
[02:26:12.521 --> 02:26:13.021]  Hold on, Scott.
[02:26:13.041 --> 02:26:16.022]  Scott, do five more minutes with us ahead of Maria Z. We've got to go to break.
[02:26:16.042 --> 02:26:16.582]  Do five more, OK?
[02:26:17.717 --> 02:26:17.957]  Certainly.
[02:26:19.198 --> 02:26:20.339]  Folks, the hour is late.
[02:26:20.359 --> 02:26:21.540]  There's not much more time.
[02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:22.501]  Get right with God.
[02:26:23.142 --> 02:26:24.843]  Biden bulldozers are smashing.
[02:26:24.883 --> 02:26:26.324]  Barbara put up by Governor Abbott.
[02:26:26.404 --> 02:26:28.526]  Abbott's not perfect, but he's been doing better lately.
[02:26:28.586 --> 02:26:29.367]  I'm not defending him.
[02:26:29.407 --> 02:26:33.210]  I'm just saying, you know, he's moved 30 degrees, 4 degrees towards us.
[02:26:34.051 --> 02:26:36.072]  And this is just outrageous what's going on.
[02:26:36.092 --> 02:26:36.813]  We're going to go to break.
[02:26:36.873 --> 02:26:38.715]  Final segment with Scott Bennett.
[02:26:39.435 --> 02:26:41.136]  Then the War Room is at 3 p.m.

[02:27:24.665 --> 02:27:27.545]   Those that bought the last book signed are the reason we're on air.
[02:27:27.545 --> 02:27:31.584]   We are literally in the thick of the battle doing our most important work right now, and
[02:27:31.584 --> 02:27:33.305]  we need funds more than ever.

[02:27:53.949 --> 02:28:01.215]  Our number four, straight ahead, final segment with Scott Bennett and then Maria Z takes over from the Battleground Australia.
[02:28:01.235 --> 02:28:03.017]  GlobalFreedomTV.com.
[02:28:04.778 --> 02:28:11.604]  Secretary of State Blinken just had his hearing he's at disrupted by a bunch of people taking it over, leftists.
[02:28:12.505 --> 02:28:14.987]  But that's okay, they're allowed to, they probably won't even get arrested.
[02:28:15.607 --> 02:28:18.289]  But if they were right-wingers, they'd go to jail for four to twenty years.
[02:28:19.306 --> 02:28:21.187]  And call it an insurrection.
[02:28:21.787 --> 02:28:26.490]  Now I believe it's exercising their free speech, but the leftists are able to exercise theirs.
[02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:32.733]  But I love how the left starts the war, does all this with the globals, then they are also the opposition to it.
[02:28:33.314 --> 02:28:35.395]  That is their attempt at full spectrum dominance.
[02:28:36.195 --> 02:28:37.496]  Is it not, Scott Bennett?
[02:28:39.258 --> 02:28:43.120]  It is, and it points to something very important to remember, Alex, in closing.
[02:28:43.781 --> 02:28:50.725]  Remember Plato's Pyramid, where you had the philosopher kings and the enforcers and the peasants, if you will.
[02:28:50.845 --> 02:28:52.406]  Three branches of society.
[02:28:52.926 --> 02:29:03.412]  Well, if we break that down modernly, you have the politicians, the philosopher kings, although they're not that bright, and the enforcers, which are the police, the FBI, the ATF.
[02:29:03.452 --> 02:29:06.074]  We know there's terrible corruption on that level.
[02:29:06.474 --> 02:29:13.514]   and then the mass population. We own and control and are represented by two-thirds of that pyramid.
[02:29:13.514 --> 02:29:22.953]   One-third are bad and against us. So two-thirds of the police and law enforcement and all that
[02:29:22.953 --> 02:29:27.273]   are on our side. These are decent people. These are traditional family values people.
[02:29:27.273 --> 02:29:30.953]   These are conservatives at heart. And that's why the left's been trying to purge them.
[02:29:30.953 --> 02:29:33.113]  Yes, that's right.
[02:29:33.337 --> 02:29:34.578]  And the same with the military.
[02:29:35.058 --> 02:29:41.543]  But it is important in this moment going forward that people have to be influencers.
[02:29:41.723 --> 02:29:49.429]  They have to be, as I did when I was in the Army, hostage negotiation or influence operations people.
[02:29:49.509 --> 02:30:02.936]   That means when you engage police, you have to recognize A lot of the police are traumatized, they're medicated, they're brainwashed with treat everybody like a hostile element and control them.
[02:30:03.516 --> 02:30:14.142]  You have to communicate with the police in the incoming days and months and year that may come as a calming effect, as a counselor, as a officer.
[02:30:14.182 --> 02:30:16.603]  Be advised there's a situation handling here.
[02:30:16.683 --> 02:30:18.044]  There's something going on here.
[02:30:18.364 --> 02:30:19.464]  We're on your side.
[02:30:19.524 --> 02:30:20.905]  We're not antagonistic.
[02:30:20.965 --> 02:30:22.806]  We're not trying to disrupt anything.
[02:30:23.226 --> 02:30:33.850]  Please understand, you took an oath to the Constitution as I did, and we are bound by that oath to preserve the Constitution and our rights therein, and nothing can violate these rights.
[02:30:34.211 --> 02:30:36.832]  Our rights are not to be suspended by a health mandate.
[02:30:36.852 --> 02:30:39.893]  That's right, the globalists want destabilization, we're bringing stabilization.
[02:30:40.819 --> 02:30:52.804]  Bringing stabilization, bringing calm, bringing reason, bringing harmony, bringing tranquility, opening up the windows where carbon monoxide has filled the room.
[02:30:52.904 --> 02:31:01.028]  And that is the fear and the dread and the animosity and the claims of, well, all those Trump supporting white Anglo-Saxon Republicans are bigots and homophobes.
[02:31:01.428 --> 02:31:01.928]  No, no, no.
[02:31:02.108 --> 02:31:04.049]  Open the windows and let truth come in.
[02:31:04.469 --> 02:31:08.332]  And let that fresh breath of harmony come in.
[02:31:08.633 --> 02:31:12.096]  And you'll see these police begin to de-escalate.
[02:31:12.176 --> 02:31:21.263]  And it's important because we cannot allow emotion and hostility and aggression and, well, you know, no one's going to take my guns and this and that.
[02:31:21.303 --> 02:31:24.866]  Well, you can see it, because when I was younger, when the police were working for the system, I'd get in their face.
[02:31:25.327 --> 02:31:26.568]  Now I'm just nice and everything.
[02:31:26.868 --> 02:31:31.012]  And I just say, hey, we're all trying to... And then you see them deflect and go, oh, OK, all right, great.
[02:31:31.032 --> 02:31:32.693]  They actually go, oh, yeah, all right.
[02:31:32.953 --> 02:31:33.493]  That's right.
[02:31:33.633 --> 02:31:34.974]  And that's what leaders do.
[02:31:35.234 --> 02:31:37.054]  That's what intelligent people do.
[02:31:37.294 --> 02:31:40.815]  They do not go into a fight on their terms in their sandbox.
[02:31:40.935 --> 02:31:44.296]  We define the terms and the boundaries in our sandbox.
[02:31:44.716 --> 02:31:47.036]  And we pull people to our side.
[02:31:47.457 --> 02:31:55.178]  We pull the police and the ATF and the FBI and the CIA and others who are armed with guns and badges to our side.
[02:31:55.578 --> 02:31:57.119]  And we make them informants.
[02:31:57.499 --> 02:31:58.999]  We make them allies.
[02:31:59.059 --> 02:31:59.699]  And that's happening.
[02:31:59.719 --> 02:32:01.500]  We're seeing record numbers of whistleblowers.
[02:32:02.907 --> 02:32:03.668]  Whistleblowers.
[02:32:03.748 --> 02:32:17.082]  And these people are, again, they often are beta males, maybe beta pluses, but they're not the alpha or sigma personalities of persuasion and influence.
[02:32:17.343 --> 02:32:18.724]  They're not special forces types.
[02:32:18.844 --> 02:32:20.026]  I know what they're like.
[02:32:20.546 --> 02:32:21.366]  And that's okay.
[02:32:21.506 --> 02:32:26.248]  That's what special forces leader types, alpha male types, like yourself and others, we do.
[02:32:26.608 --> 02:32:31.229]  We go in gently, harmoniously, tranquilly, and saying, come over here.
[02:32:31.489 --> 02:32:33.370]  Taste and see that the Lord is good.
[02:32:33.890 --> 02:32:34.910]  That truth is good.
[02:32:34.950 --> 02:32:35.871]  That harmony is good.
[02:32:36.191 --> 02:32:45.514]  The buoyancy and the joy and the smile that we radiate wins the hearts and minds of the Hindu, the Sikh, the Asian, and the traditional leftist liberal.
[02:32:45.814 --> 02:32:51.040]   Remember the left, the Democrats, are in a horrific No, you're right.
[02:32:51.081 --> 02:32:51.565]  Incredible.
[02:32:51.404 --> 02:33:08.404]  Thank you so much.
[02:33:08.653 --> 02:33:10.774]  Your brain force and all that makes me better.
[02:33:10.814 --> 02:33:11.935]  They make me more focused.
[02:33:12.015 --> 02:33:13.075]  They make me feel better.
[02:33:13.095 --> 02:33:17.418]  A lot of lingering effects from when I was getting sober have now relieved me.
[02:33:17.558 --> 02:33:19.299]  My girlfriend goes to the gym and goes hard.
[02:33:19.319 --> 02:33:20.799]  She's on the Tumeric and the same stuff.
[02:33:21.260 --> 02:33:22.780]  These products will change your life.
[02:33:23.261 --> 02:33:28.063]  They fund one of the greatest things out there right now for us as free Americans.
[02:33:28.243 --> 02:33:29.604]  Please do these people a favor.
[02:33:30.104 --> 02:33:36.872]  Go to their store, support them, do what you need to do, because if we lose InfoWars, we lose a lot more than what people are willing to believe.
[02:33:37.212 --> 02:33:48.565]  If you want to really get in shape for this thing about to come, get the HGH and get that testosterone boost, man, get in the gym, because I'm in the best shape of my life because of your product, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
[02:33:49.145 --> 02:33:52.850]  To not lose the greatest symbol against tyranny the world has ever seen.
[02:33:53.110 --> 02:33:54.212]  And that's our American flag.
[02:33:54.252 --> 02:33:56.134]  And with that, I appreciate loving for us.
[02:33:56.033 --> 02:33:59.154]   I'll listen to you the day I die or you go off air, but I'm going to do my part to make
[02:33:59.154 --> 02:34:14.872]  sure you don't have a great day.
[02:34:14.889 --> 02:34:19.470]  I'm Maria Zee, your guest host here on the Alex Jones Show today.
[02:34:19.490 --> 02:34:21.350]  Wow, we have a lot to cover.
[02:34:21.430 --> 02:34:23.431]  I've got a very special guest coming on today.
[02:34:23.531 --> 02:34:26.471]  It is Josh Siegertsen from World Alternative Media.
[02:34:26.511 --> 02:34:33.773]  He's done a fantastic job reporting on current events for a very long time, incredibly well informed and researched.
[02:34:33.933 --> 02:34:36.798]  I'm really, really looking forward to talking to him to get his perspective.
[02:34:36.838 --> 02:34:38.340]  Josh, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:34:39.843 --> 02:34:41.085]  Thank you for having me, Maria.
[02:34:42.446 --> 02:34:43.327]  It's great to see you.
[02:34:43.367 --> 02:34:45.048]  Well, I really appreciate your work.
[02:34:45.108 --> 02:34:51.174]  I remember seeing your report on the Tower of Basel some time ago and been following your work since.
[02:34:51.234 --> 02:34:55.497]  I know that a lot of the Band Off video viewers are familiar with your work.
[02:34:56.318 --> 02:35:05.045]  So, you know, we're in this position now, Josh, where basically the whole world is being lulled or fooled into supporting World War Three.
[02:35:05.085 --> 02:35:06.347]  I want to talk about that with you.
[02:35:06.367 --> 02:35:13.345]   But what's happened is we've forgotten so much Of the other things that they've done to us.
[02:35:13.405 --> 02:35:15.268]  I mean, there's no talk about Maui now.
[02:35:15.308 --> 02:35:17.971]  There's very little talk about Acapulco.
[02:35:17.991 --> 02:35:22.457]  And I know you've covered these topics, so let's get into some of that.
[02:35:24.318 --> 02:35:25.139]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:35:25.199 --> 02:35:28.901]  So let's start with this Acapulco situation, because I live in Puerto Vallarta.
[02:35:28.921 --> 02:35:33.364]  We got hit by a Category 4 hurricane about two and a half weeks ago.
[02:35:33.864 --> 02:35:42.110]  And within about a week and a half after that, Acapulco gets hit by a Category 5 hurricane, one of the strongest hurricanes to ever happen.
[02:35:42.230 --> 02:35:46.813]  And of course, that hurricane was, it had no rain.
[02:35:46.993 --> 02:35:48.074]  It was just force.
[02:35:48.394 --> 02:35:56.873]   And what was interesting is earlier this year, AMLO, the president of Mexico, said no to several deals
[02:35:56.873 --> 02:36:00.474]  with the United States and Canada for green initiatives.
[02:36:00.474 --> 02:36:05.753]   And within days, several of the oil refineries mysteriously blew up, and actually,
[02:36:05.753 --> 02:36:08.474]  three of them blew up within one hour.
[02:36:08.474 --> 02:36:13.273]   And there have been a lot of questions raised, what is happening in Mexico?
[02:36:13.273 --> 02:36:17.634]   And I believe that there is a lot of weather modification happening.
[02:36:17.634 --> 02:36:23.914]   We're watching tropical storms turn into category five, some of the biggest in history, in a matter of moments.
[02:36:23.914 --> 02:36:29.513]   And within a couple hours, no one has any way to prepare themselves,
[02:36:29.513 --> 02:36:31.814]  and it's absolutely devastating.
[02:36:31.814 --> 02:36:37.753]   And there is a website, hurricaneotusrelief.com, I believe it's called.
[02:36:37.753 --> 02:36:40.713]  And there is so much happening with that.
[02:36:40.713 --> 02:36:43.314]  We saw it in Maui, we saw it in Canada.
[02:36:42.959 --> 02:36:52.302]  California, where we saw hurricanes and earthquakes happening at the same time as we saw hurricanes ravaging Florida, suddenly taking U-turns and destroying towns.
[02:36:52.482 --> 02:36:55.522]  And I'm a big believer that this is part of the climate agenda.
[02:36:55.842 --> 02:37:09.146]  You need to have on-the-ground support for the climate cultists in order to bring about these kinds of 15-minute cities or, for example, you know, CBDCs with carbon credits and all these different things.
[02:37:09.486 --> 02:37:10.707]  They're going after the food supply.
[02:37:10.727 --> 02:37:12.348]  They're going after the energy supply.
[02:37:12.788 --> 02:37:15.810]  And they're going after the housing market to destroy property.
[02:37:15.890 --> 02:37:20.252]  They're going after the dollar to move into the BRICS, World Reserve Currency System.
[02:37:20.652 --> 02:37:25.155]  All of these things tie into the greater reset, the great reset, the eugenics agenda.
[02:37:25.655 --> 02:37:32.039]  And what we've seen in places like Acapulco is absolutely devastating with almost no media coverage at all.
[02:37:32.379 --> 02:37:35.400]  Except for a few people like Jeff Berwick, myself, Max Egan.
[02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:36.760]  A few people have talked about it.
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:38.881]  But, you know, people are suffering on the ground.
[02:37:38.941 --> 02:37:41.601]  The military has had a hard time getting in there.
[02:37:41.941 --> 02:37:49.243]  And, you know, people are trying to hand out food and water and different necessities, but are hitting a lot of brick walls with it.
[02:37:49.343 --> 02:37:52.564]  So, it's the same old thing that we see with FEMA in the United States.
[02:37:52.644 --> 02:37:55.485]  For example, with Hurricane Harvey.
[02:37:55.953 --> 02:38:08.155]  People were trying to get goods and services to the people who were affected by it, and I have a friend named Danny Sessom who went in there and was trying to give out food and water to people, and FEMA was stopping them.
[02:38:08.475 --> 02:38:12.496]  We see in Maui, they were blocking off the roads, allowing people to burn to death.
[02:38:12.776 --> 02:38:20.037]  There is an agenda going on, and it's part of this greater agenda that actually this World War III situation ties into very much so as well.
[02:38:20.317 --> 02:38:33.241]   It's a move to the Great Reset, and they're trying to cut off every single thing that humanity Well, yes, and I want to talk to you about the World War Three situation separately, and we will get there.
[02:38:33.301 --> 02:38:35.582]  But you mentioned Max Egan.
[02:38:35.622 --> 02:38:42.585]  I saw that he posted and actually shared from him about the fact that there were talks for Acapulco to be a smart city.
[02:38:43.125 --> 02:38:46.206]  And I was just speaking to someone yesterday, Josh, and I said, you know what?
[02:38:46.546 --> 02:38:53.569]  I was told some time ago by a senator here in Australia who's been on this broadcast with me, great senator, Senator Roberts.
[02:38:54.470 --> 02:39:01.815]  And he said to me, Maria, they don't need to go and destroy places to make them smart cities, because we had this huge flood here in Lismore.
[02:39:02.336 --> 02:39:06.078]  From what we heard at the time, over 50,000 people were displaced from their homes.
[02:39:06.138 --> 02:39:15.906]  And then the government sort of came back and said, oh, you know, a buyback scheme or you can't return to your homes, insurance companies wouldn't insure their homes moving forward and all of this.
[02:39:16.206 --> 02:39:18.668]  So really, it was an agenda to move people out.
[02:39:18.708 --> 02:39:23.327]   And we found out that the mayor had signed on some time ago for this to be a smart city.
[02:39:23.327 --> 02:39:27.687]   But the reality is they don't necessarily have to destroy a place to make it a smart
[02:39:27.687 --> 02:39:28.688]  city.
[02:39:28.688 --> 02:39:33.548]   We have places right now that have surveillance cameras, for example, Gold Coast in Queensland
[02:39:33.548 --> 02:39:34.548]  in Australia.
[02:39:34.548 --> 02:39:37.608]  You know, every time you blink, there's a camera.
[02:39:37.628 --> 02:39:44.151]  And so, you know, this is where I'm asking the question, why is it that they're actually going and destroying all these areas?
[02:39:44.191 --> 02:39:52.774]  I know that Lahaina was specific because the people weren't allowing sort of the developers to come in and they have some authority there.
[02:39:53.194 --> 02:39:54.114]  What do you think it is?
[02:39:54.194 --> 02:40:03.378]  Is it like you said, just to prove to these climate, you know, enthusiasts, climate change enthusiasts, that yes, climate change is causing destruction?
[02:40:05.270 --> 02:40:06.491]  Well, it's just another excuse.
[02:40:06.531 --> 02:40:10.075]  Like you say, they don't have to do this, but they can do it.
[02:40:10.235 --> 02:40:11.236]  And if they can, they will.
[02:40:11.356 --> 02:40:16.441]  And I mean, in places like Lahaina, they also were planning to create a smart grid.
[02:40:16.906 --> 02:40:21.370]  For a 15-minute city, they announced that weeks before the fires.
[02:40:21.531 --> 02:40:24.654]  And we see similar things in Oxford, UK.
[02:40:24.674 --> 02:40:35.664]  There wasn't a major weather event there, but I'm in the middle of filming a documentary on 15-minute cities, and I was in Oxford for several weeks, where they have rolled out the 15-minute cities already.
[02:40:36.025 --> 02:40:40.489]  And they don't have all the rules in place yet, but everything is monitored, everything is surveilled.
[02:40:40.628 --> 02:40:44.148]  They don't need to have a disaster to do it, but it helps.
[02:40:44.148 --> 02:40:50.227]   And, you know, with Mexico, we see Acapulco get hit directly by a Category 5, which is
[02:40:50.227 --> 02:40:51.227]  insane.
[02:40:51.227 --> 02:40:57.548]   We see Puerto Vallarta, where I live here right now, get hit directly by a Category
[02:40:57.548 --> 02:40:58.948]  4 a week and a half earlier.
[02:40:58.948 --> 02:41:05.428]   We see in between those two hurricanes, Cabo get hit nearly directly by another major hurricane
[02:41:05.428 --> 02:41:06.428]  system.
[02:41:06.428 --> 02:41:09.948]   And, you know, we're seeing a lot more of this than we ever have before in history.
[02:41:09.948 --> 02:41:14.588]   And we have whistleblowers coming out of, you know, for example, Antarctica, there was
[02:41:14.588 --> 02:41:19.307]   a recent whistleblower in special ops who talked about underground bases.
[02:41:19.278 --> 02:41:25.761]  And no one has disputed his claims that they led to earthquakes in places like Christchurch in New Zealand.
[02:41:25.801 --> 02:41:28.382]  So again, these things are happening.
[02:41:28.522 --> 02:41:29.302]  Do they need to do it?
[02:41:29.642 --> 02:41:30.723]  No, they don't need to do it.
[02:41:31.003 --> 02:41:36.845]  But it definitely helps to get those climate cultists on board and to get them to become more and more extreme.
[02:41:37.125 --> 02:41:40.306]   And even without the extremities, It's like the trans agenda.
[02:41:40.326 --> 02:41:44.288]  They can talk all day on TV about how everyone cares about, well, the trans agenda.
[02:41:44.488 --> 02:41:46.688]  It's a very small percentage of the population.
[02:41:46.729 --> 02:41:53.971]  The media makes people think everyone supports something when they don't, in order to get everyone to support things, because it becomes a trend.
[02:41:54.311 --> 02:41:58.332]  If no one is supporting something, then no one cares, and no one does anything.
[02:41:58.472 --> 02:42:07.155]  Before they had all these major storms this year, last year and the year before, we had factory fires, and we had all these different examples of, you know, attacks on the food supply.
[02:42:07.635 --> 02:42:19.908]  With the attacks on the food supply, they essentially got a whole bunch of people who don't believe in the climate agenda to agree with a lot of the rules that they would bring upon us with, you know, the climate laws because it would ration food.
[02:42:20.268 --> 02:42:26.774]  So even without people believing that it's global warming, they still managed to get people to go, hey, wait, there's shortages of food.
[02:42:27.115 --> 02:42:29.257]  What can we do to solve this situation?
[02:42:29.617 --> 02:42:35.700]  Oh, carbon credits and and, you know, these rations on on a block chain attached to a CBDC.
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:39.462]  That is one of the main agendas going forward in this great reset.
[02:42:39.762 --> 02:42:41.263]  And they tested it.
[02:42:41.303 --> 02:42:44.404]  The litmus test was the vaccine passports in 2021 into 2022.
[02:42:46.565 --> 02:42:54.708]  And, you know, as I was on the ground in many of these places around the world reporting on that, I remember saying at the time, next thing is climate than World War Three.
[02:42:55.088 --> 02:42:55.368]  Why?
[02:42:55.448 --> 02:42:57.149]  Because it's a perfect sequence of events.
[02:42:57.469 --> 02:43:03.731]  It's constant, you know, trauma for people who are wanting to get somewhere in life, do something productive in their life.
[02:43:03.751 --> 02:43:06.632]  They don't want to actually do anything because they feel what's the point.
[02:43:07.033 --> 02:43:18.194]   And you also have one thing hitting someone after another until it's so normalized that everyone just goes along with it from vaccine passports to the climate lockdowns and the creation of carbon credits,
[02:43:18.194 --> 02:43:22.314]   which are already, by the way, on bank accounts throughout the world, they're just
[02:43:22.314 --> 02:43:23.335]  not enforced yet.
[02:43:23.335 --> 02:43:29.594]   And of course, eventually a world war with Israel as the icing on the cake.
[02:43:29.594 --> 02:43:32.954]   We've been experiencing people having their bank accounts frozen.
[02:43:33.146 --> 02:43:35.507]  Happened to someone that I know very well here.
[02:43:35.547 --> 02:43:38.489]  It looks like it had something to do with digital ID, actually.
[02:43:39.149 --> 02:43:45.492]  And then once I posted that story, so many people in our audience told us that it's been happening to them as well.
[02:43:45.552 --> 02:43:47.414]  So the banks have gone absolutely mad.
[02:43:47.714 --> 02:43:51.596]  They're ramping things up, getting the world ready for this transition into digital.
[02:43:51.856 --> 02:43:53.457]  We'll be back right after this short break.
[02:43:53.537 --> 02:43:55.238]  Amazing analysis with Josh Siegertson.
[02:43:56.173 --> 02:44:05.040]  And we are back with Josh Sigurdsson, incredibly well researched, very, very, you know, always backs up all of his claims.
[02:44:05.380 --> 02:44:08.963]  I really, really appreciate his content and him being here today.
[02:44:08.983 --> 02:44:14.608]  You can follow him at World Alternative Media and we'll let you know where to follow, all the places you can follow him towards the end of this.
[02:44:14.688 --> 02:44:20.192]  But Josh, just before the break, we were talking about this escalation into World War III and how they essentially need this.
[02:44:20.953 --> 02:44:26.157]   And you can really see that This is how I've sort of reasoned this in my mind.
[02:44:26.518 --> 02:44:40.010]  When you look at all of the other building blocks that they're building towards digital totalitarianism, and that coincides with the timing of them leading us into World War Three, it really shows you that this is all planned.
[02:44:41.011 --> 02:44:50.580]  Quickly, one example I can give everyone, you know, just this week I reported on the fact that Australia and the US have just signed a Memorandum of Understanding.
[02:44:50.860 --> 02:45:02.331]  We're going to create essentially an Australian EPA with the Department of Climate Change, and together they're going to work together to mitigate methane, so start killing off our livestock.
[02:45:02.871 --> 02:45:17.804]  And, you know, make sure that they're tracking and tracing, taking stock of every single natural resource too, which will then be weaponised against us and they'll be able to limit our access to things like even water, depending on our social credit scores.
[02:45:17.824 --> 02:45:19.025]  That's how far this can go.
[02:45:19.385 --> 02:45:21.066]  And so I reported on that this week.
[02:45:21.427 --> 02:45:29.313]  And the fact that they're meeting up and talking about these things while we have an escalation into World War Three is clear indication that this is absolutely all planned.
[02:45:29.554 --> 02:45:29.954]  Your take?
[02:45:31.812 --> 02:45:47.011]   Well, we had John Kerry recently in the United States calling for an end to farming in order to stop climate change and then in the same speech he's talking about how we're having problems with the food supply because of climate change and it's destroying the food supply.
[02:45:47.011 --> 02:45:48.172]  So which one is it?
[02:45:48.172 --> 02:45:51.371]   Of course, we know what's happening in the Netherlands, the attack on the farmers,
[02:45:51.371 --> 02:45:56.570]   the same thing's happening in Germany, in Ireland, in Canada, and in the United States,
[02:45:56.570 --> 02:45:58.252]  and many bills have been signed.
[02:45:58.252 --> 02:46:03.490]   I do wanna correct one thing that I mentioned in the first segment, which the website is
[02:46:03.490 --> 02:46:07.011]  hurricaneotisrecovery.com when it comes to Acapulco.
[02:46:07.011 --> 02:46:08.131]  I wanna make sure I get that right.
[02:46:08.131 --> 02:46:14.252]   But yeah, with the attacks on different cities around the world and the food supply specifically,
[02:46:14.252 --> 02:46:20.490]   the two things that you can really get people to fall on their knees for is, of course,
[02:46:20.490 --> 02:46:22.412]  food and the banking system.
[02:46:22.545 --> 02:46:27.708]  So if you can access your money, you are pretty much in the hands of the globalists.
[02:46:27.908 --> 02:46:33.390]  And if you cannot access food, you will do whatever you need to do to feed yourself and your family.
[02:46:33.530 --> 02:46:36.372]  And unfortunately, that's what they are preparing for.
[02:46:36.432 --> 02:46:41.495]   They're going after the farmers so that you don't have Access to this meat so you end up in a soylent
[02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:45.863]  Green type scenario in the future where you have to ask the government for rations.
[02:46:46.163 --> 02:46:47.224]  And they'll give you rations.
[02:46:47.484 --> 02:46:49.606]  They'll give you mRNA infused rations.
[02:46:49.626 --> 02:46:50.626]  They'll give you bugs.
[02:46:50.686 --> 02:46:51.707]  They'll give you insects.
[02:46:51.747 --> 02:46:54.429]  They'll give you all the things that they have been preparing for.
[02:46:54.789 --> 02:47:06.738]  Recently, Tyson Foods, which is one of the biggest companies in the world for poultry as well as many other meat processings, called for, well, started actually working with a company called Protix.
[02:47:07.078 --> 02:47:10.801]  And this, this company deals with insect food.
[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:20.225]  And I believe that we are going to see a lot more companies start getting involved in just, you know, insects, bugs, mealworms, crickets, this kind of stuff.
[02:47:20.405 --> 02:47:24.368]  Stuff that's very high in, of course, parasites, generally speaking.
[02:47:25.028 --> 02:47:28.891]  And, of course, they want, they see us as animals, they see us as a livestock.
[02:47:29.151 --> 02:47:32.333]  So what's the use of the other livestock if we're the new livestock?
[02:47:32.353 --> 02:47:35.435]  They can feed us bugs like they've been feeding the animals on the farm.
[02:47:35.915 --> 02:47:46.442]   And that is their take on this, and that is why It's so important to tell people to get storable foods and tell people to stock up on things, tell people to defend themselves.
[02:47:46.482 --> 02:47:51.945]  Of course, you in Australia don't have very good rights when it comes to actually defending yourself.
[02:47:52.265 --> 02:47:59.370]  However, you can still defend yourself with food, water, shelter, your own property, something outside of big cities.
[02:47:59.450 --> 02:48:01.452]  And that, I think, is very important going forward.
[02:48:01.692 --> 02:48:04.834]  But yeah, it's all part of the same agenda and then you end up with a carbon credit.
[02:48:06.328 --> 02:48:08.249]  They're trying to take the properties too, Josh.
[02:48:08.349 --> 02:48:26.916]  I'm not sure if viewers are aware, recently they tried to bring in a law where if you want to disturb more than 50 centimetres of your soil, you have to have a soil on your own property, you have to have an independent body come and assess that soil and tell you whether it's actually heritage or not, or sacred to the Aboriginals or not.
[02:48:27.896 --> 02:48:29.817]  Aboriginal people aren't the ones pushing for this.
[02:48:29.857 --> 02:48:32.078]  This is the ones that are in bed with the UN.
[02:48:32.578 --> 02:48:52.068]  But Josh, I want to talk about this escalation into World War 3 and how they are actually, through this trauma cycle and through what they're telling us to pay attention to in the media, you mentioned this before, barely anyone heard about Acapulco, but all we're hearing about is the situation in the Middle East.
[02:48:52.088 --> 02:48:54.189]  And it's not a situation, it's a war, I shouldn't call it that.
[02:48:54.769 --> 02:48:56.830]  And rightly so, people are really suffering.
[02:48:56.930 --> 02:49:00.792]  Israel are committing horrific crimes right now before our very eyes.
[02:49:01.192 --> 02:49:07.296]  I'm not an apologist for Hamas, but I will always go back to the question, why was there a stand down?
[02:49:07.356 --> 02:49:08.317]  Why did you let them in?
[02:49:08.958 --> 02:49:12.580]  And so, what is your take on this situation?
[02:49:12.940 --> 02:49:16.043]  How quickly do you think the world is going to escalate into this?
[02:49:16.303 --> 02:49:20.686]  And, you know, I know you've been dissecting some of the lies coming out of that region as well.
[02:49:22.467 --> 02:49:23.168]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:49:23.227 --> 02:49:28.827]   So first of all, we need to understand that Israel created Hamas, the Mossad created Hamas
[02:49:28.827 --> 02:49:31.106]  alongside the CIA and MI6.
[02:49:31.106 --> 02:49:34.187]  Hamas is a group that is meant as a punching bag.
[02:49:34.187 --> 02:49:41.586]   I think it was back in 2019, Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel must support bolstering Hamas
[02:49:41.586 --> 02:49:46.786]   and transferring money to Hamas because they needed this punching bag.
[02:49:46.786 --> 02:49:52.347]   And it was interesting because earlier on in this year, March of 2023, Iran said it
[02:49:52.347 --> 02:49:58.427]   discovered what could be the world's second largest lithium deposit, which is also a major
[02:49:58.427 --> 02:49:59.906]  thing to remember here.
[02:49:59.903 --> 02:50:02.185]  But generally, this has been going on for a long time.
[02:50:02.205 --> 02:50:04.307]  This is part of what they call the Greater Israel Project.
[02:50:04.327 --> 02:50:06.328]  They've been destabilizing the Middle East for years.
[02:50:06.769 --> 02:50:09.251]  Israel, okay, let's start with this.
[02:50:09.531 --> 02:50:11.253]  A little history lesson to those who aren't aware.
[02:50:11.633 --> 02:50:13.194]  World War I was a reset.
[02:50:13.234 --> 02:50:14.675]  World War II was a reset.
[02:50:14.715 --> 02:50:20.540]  World War III is the new great reset with technocracy and social credit and all that.
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:23.662]  So every major world war, we have a reset.
[02:50:24.043 --> 02:50:25.944]  In World War I, we had Federal Reserve.
[02:50:26.224 --> 02:50:29.907]  We had the creation of the League of Nations, which would later become the United Nations.
[02:50:30.268 --> 02:50:36.548]   and of course the Balfour Declaration signed by Lord Rothschild for the state of Israel.
[02:50:36.548 --> 02:50:43.747]   And we fast forward to the 1940s, FDR created a new deal going into World War II.
[02:50:43.747 --> 02:50:48.268]   It was a total new economic outlook, which is similar to what we're seeing today.
[02:50:48.268 --> 02:50:51.587]   And all the while he's funding, arming and funding Ho Chi Minh.
[02:50:51.587 --> 02:50:54.787]  Now World War II, they're propping up the Soviets.
[02:50:54.787 --> 02:50:59.768]   And then we see everything come collapsing down, Hitler loses, and next thing we know
[02:50:59.768 --> 02:51:02.768]  we have the United Nations and we have the State of Israel.
[02:51:03.069 --> 02:51:08.513]  The League of Nations turns into the United Nations, it's supposed to stop wars, even though they've allowed most wars since their inception.
[02:51:08.873 --> 02:51:14.837]  Then we go into the 1950s, and we have, you know, what they did in Iran, the Iranian coup.
[02:51:15.277 --> 02:51:19.739]  The missile coup, where they overthrew their government, and they propped up a new government in Iran.
[02:51:20.639 --> 02:51:25.041]  Then we have the Korean War, where they created this divide between North and South Korea.
[02:51:25.301 --> 02:51:33.604]  Then we have the 60s, where we have Vietnam, where they're fighting against their own weapons that, as I said previously, FDR was involved in arming them with.
[02:51:33.864 --> 02:51:35.165]  Then we have the 70s.
[02:51:35.765 --> 02:51:40.707]  Kissinger meets with Mao Zedong in China and creates an alliance with them, saving the country from starvation.
[02:51:40.866 --> 02:51:47.826]   and essentially creating an export-import monopoly for them, which also leads to Kissinger meeting with the Saudis to
[02:51:47.826 --> 02:51:52.305]   create the petrodollar system, which is losing now because Saudi Arabia just joined BRICS.
[02:51:52.305 --> 02:51:57.106]   Then we have the Trilateral Commission and the creation of what Zbigniew Brzezinski called
[02:51:57.106 --> 02:52:00.545]   the technocratic global government using China as a guinea pig state.
[02:52:00.545 --> 02:52:01.545]  I'm getting somewhere.
[02:52:01.545 --> 02:52:04.385]  So just hold on, hang with me for a second, my friends.
[02:52:04.385 --> 02:52:05.385]  Then we have...
[02:52:05.385 --> 02:52:08.705]   You've got 30 seconds till the break, so I'm just letting you know.
[02:52:08.705 --> 02:52:10.385]  We'll definitely continue on the other side.
[02:52:10.385 --> 02:52:15.706]   The Mujahideen, al-Qaeda, the Mujahideen, and of course ISIS and the Taliban and all
[02:52:15.706 --> 02:52:18.466]  these different entities were created by the US government.
[02:52:18.420 --> 02:52:35.814]  Iraq was armed and funded, the Baathist Party, and that leads us to Ukraine, 2014, was propped up by the US, and now of course the home of the Khazarians, and now in this current time we're seeing all of this combat against itself, and we see it all crumbling down just as it was planned.
[02:52:35.834 --> 02:52:38.416]  Josh, don't go anywhere, we'll be back right after this show.
[02:52:39.048 --> 02:52:58.320]  You know, I'm so grateful for this platform because not only do we get to hear from the amazing InfoWars cast and Alex and all the hosts, but we also get to have the greatest minds of independent media coming, discussing world events and getting this information out to the masses so that they can realise what is really going on.
[02:52:58.380 --> 02:53:13.829]   Social media is a cesspit, you know, and so these broadcasts really do provide a lot of clarity And I do encourage everyone to support Alex, support InfoWars, get Alex's new book, get the signed copy, you know, as the fundraiser for the broadcast.
[02:53:14.029 --> 02:53:15.349]  I've personally ordered mine.
[02:53:15.389 --> 02:53:16.290]  I'm looking forward to it.
[02:53:16.630 --> 02:53:20.052]  We're here with Josh Siegert, an independent journalist and researcher.
[02:53:20.112 --> 02:53:23.113]  Amazing, amazing information from World Alternative Media.
[02:53:23.153 --> 02:53:28.036]  Josh, before the break, you were giving us a history of the wars and how we've led up to this point.
[02:53:28.096 --> 02:53:28.736]  Please continue.
[02:53:30.405 --> 02:53:37.690]  Okay, so I kind of left off in the 1970s where we have, you know, the arming and funding of the Mujahideen, later Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
[02:53:38.030 --> 02:53:45.816]  Moving into around that same time, we have the World Economic Forum becoming a really major power head in the globalist order.
[02:53:46.256 --> 02:54:01.182]   And then we're moving into the 80s where we have more arming and funding of Iraq, eventually leading to a battle between the United States and Iraq against their own weapons, much like we just saw with, of course, Vietnam and how FDR armed Ho Chi Minh in the first place.
[02:54:01.182 --> 02:54:05.903]   So we have all these countries that are getting propped up and then maybe attacked or maybe supported later.
[02:54:05.903 --> 02:54:12.221]   We get into the 2000s, we have 9/11, and obviously that changed the entire world.
[02:54:12.221 --> 02:54:17.862]   It was its own reset in its own way, where we move into the Iraq-Afghanistan war,
[02:54:17.862 --> 02:54:23.022]   a complete destabilization of the Middle East, and the US fighting and the British fighting
[02:54:23.022 --> 02:54:28.502]   and the French fighting against the very people that they helped create and bolster in the first place.
[02:54:28.509 --> 02:54:29.370]  And I can't forget Israel.
[02:54:30.129 --> 02:54:32.528]  Israel was backing all of those wars.
[02:54:32.528 --> 02:54:39.209]   So we have the complete destabilization of the Middle East moving into then 2014 with
[02:54:39.209 --> 02:54:47.808]   the bolstering of Ukraine when they had a Russian supporting president, which they overthrew.
[02:54:47.808 --> 02:54:53.409]   Now this leads us to today where we have of course the homeland of the Khazarians.
[02:54:53.409 --> 02:54:56.449]  Keep in mind that we have a destabilized Middle East.
[02:54:56.449 --> 02:55:00.968]   We have Israel going for the Greater Israel Project, which is a Nile to the Euphrates.
[02:55:00.968 --> 02:55:02.568]  That's how big they want their borders.
[02:55:02.568 --> 02:55:03.568]  They say this themselves.
[02:55:03.568 --> 02:55:09.028]   In fact, Benjamin Netanyahu just said a couple days ago in his speech that you must remember
[02:55:09.028 --> 02:55:11.168]  what Amalek has done to you.
[02:55:11.196 --> 02:55:24.426]  And if I quote 1 Samuel 15 3, it says, Now go and smite Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not, but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
[02:55:24.746 --> 02:55:36.475]   So this is a very important point because this is them saying, hey, we are owning up to prophecy, which is a very scary thing when we're talking about A prophecy that says, kill everyone that's not you.
[02:55:37.035 --> 02:55:52.185]  And, you know, people, DeSantis said the other day, even though DeSantis is like, don't say anything bad about Israel, because he's, you know, first pro-free speech when it comes to speaking out against COVID tyranny, but now anti-free speech if you say anything bad about Israel, it's supporting terrorism.
[02:55:52.965 --> 02:55:54.606]  You know, all these guys are hypocritical.
[02:55:54.626 --> 02:55:57.328]  Yeah, and goes to Israel to sign laws to that effect.
[02:55:58.829 --> 02:56:05.250]  Right, and so he also is right about one thing though, is that China is the main player in this game.
[02:56:05.290 --> 02:56:17.613]  Now we have Israel, which is the icing on the cake, and will lead to a massive order where we have Israel from the Nile to the Euphrates, and they've already moved people into the Sinai region, 2.5 million Palestinians.
[02:56:18.133 --> 02:56:33.882]   And what happens above the Nile and the Euphrates, well I mean the Tigris and the Euphrates, the old Mesopotamia, well it's very ancient land, very symbolic land, You have Turkey, which is on the side of Russia, and you have the Black Sea, and above the Black Sea, you have Ukraine.
[02:56:34.223 --> 02:56:38.908]  So, and that is a homeland, a very important land for Talmudic Jews.
[02:56:39.268 --> 02:56:41.311]  So it's very interesting that this is the case.
[02:56:41.611 --> 02:56:46.972]   Now, I want to point out that Russia and Israel are very supportive of each other.
[02:56:46.972 --> 02:56:49.972]   Israel is one of the top Russian-speaking countries in the world.
[02:56:49.972 --> 02:56:55.172]   Yet, the US is on Ukraine's side and Russia and you remember last year,
[02:56:55.172 --> 02:57:01.372]   Israel called for Ukraine to surrender and they were very pro-Russia.
[02:57:01.483 --> 02:57:04.565]  Now Russia is saying, hey, what Israel is doing is awful.
[02:57:04.605 --> 02:57:10.750]  We need to support Hamas and Hezbollah and is supportive of Iran, which the US is against.
[02:57:11.531 --> 02:57:17.636]  But again, the US armed and funded Iran in the first place, and Iran is fighting against Israel, which is supportive of Russia.
[02:57:17.976 --> 02:57:18.757]  It is insanity.
[02:57:19.017 --> 02:57:20.678]  But the main player is China.
[02:57:21.038 --> 02:57:24.241]  Everything has been based on the idea of China.
[02:57:24.281 --> 02:57:25.281]  It's not the Chinese people.
[02:57:25.522 --> 02:57:26.863]  It's not even the government so much.
[02:57:26.923 --> 02:57:29.905]  They're a testing ground for an idea worldwide.
[02:57:29.965 --> 02:57:31.066]  That is technocracy.
[02:57:31.306 --> 02:57:33.407]  That's a BRICS, World Reserve Currency System.
[02:57:33.748 --> 02:57:40.572]  And it will leave the West in the dust, because the real idea is to move from the West to the East, and there will be two world religions.
[02:57:40.613 --> 02:57:52.420]   And that will be Talmudic Zionism, And statism and statism is the most dangerous religion on the planet because it is the idea that no matter what the government does, they are just looking out for you.
[02:57:52.461 --> 02:57:54.242]  They're there to help and support you.
[02:57:54.662 --> 02:58:05.589]  And I think it was Ron Paul who said very aptly many years ago, you know, never trust a government that says they've come to help you or where the government were here to help you.
[02:58:05.849 --> 02:58:10.129]   And I actually think Reagan said that and then Ron Paul reiterated it at a debate.
[02:58:10.129 --> 02:58:15.889]   But point is, we are moving into the BRICS world reserve currency system and China, Russia,
[02:58:15.889 --> 02:58:17.448]  India are major players.
[02:58:17.448 --> 02:58:20.929]  Now we have Argentina, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates.
[02:58:20.929 --> 02:58:24.168]  And of course, that goes to all these countries that the US.
[02:58:24.214 --> 02:58:26.236]  either propped up or propped up and then destroyed.
[02:58:26.816 --> 02:58:28.778]  And it's all one big agenda.
[02:58:28.818 --> 02:58:30.039]  They're all working together.
[02:58:30.680 --> 02:58:33.742]  You know, we have Hamas and Israel, I guarantee you, working together.
[02:58:33.822 --> 02:58:35.904]  Otherwise, there wouldn't have been a military stand down.
[02:58:36.144 --> 02:58:38.687]  They wouldn't have allowed the Iron Dome to break for that long.
[02:58:38.967 --> 02:58:39.647]  It's impossible.
[02:58:40.028 --> 02:58:44.592]  Egypt says they warned Israel 10 days before the attack that it was going to happen.
[02:58:45.032 --> 02:58:51.715]  And most of the deaths at the festival were Israel and Hamas shooting it out between each other with festival goers in the middle.
[02:58:52.016 --> 02:58:53.456]  A lot of people aren't talking about that.
[02:58:53.756 --> 02:58:56.558]  So this is something very symbolic.
[02:58:56.578 --> 02:59:00.500]  They have the Tower of Babel and then they have the Temple on the Mount.
[02:59:00.640 --> 02:59:02.501]  I just want to back up what you're saying.
[02:59:02.541 --> 02:59:12.906]  We've had multiple interviews with Israelis confirming this and one particular one that went viral with, you know, it was a hostage that was released.
[02:59:13.777 --> 02:59:18.409]  And sadly her partner was killed and she says he was killed in the crossfire.
[02:59:18.928 --> 02:59:22.729]  So she's not saying the Israeli forces killed the hostages.
[02:59:22.789 --> 02:59:26.430]  She's saying they were killed by the IDF in the crossfire.
[02:59:27.031 --> 02:59:31.452]  And so, you know, they didn't go there with that intention, but that's what happened.
[02:59:31.892 --> 02:59:37.714]  And, you know, there's so much atrocity propaganda at the moment, Josh.
[02:59:37.734 --> 02:59:41.956]  People are just really becoming emotionally unstable when it comes to this situation.
[02:59:41.996 --> 02:59:43.296]  They're not able to think critically.
[02:59:44.855 --> 02:59:45.516]  On both sides.
[02:59:45.556 --> 02:59:59.391]  I mean, we have masked morons in New York shutting down, you know, Grand Central Station in support of Palestine, while you have people on the right who are against the, you know, COVID tyranny who are now supporting Israel because they're our closest ally.
[02:59:59.691 --> 03:00:00.012]  Why?
[03:00:00.132 --> 03:00:01.453]  Why are they the closest ally?
[03:00:01.493 --> 03:00:04.136]  They literally are blowing up Christian churches.
[03:00:04.396 --> 03:00:05.878]  They're blowing up Christian hospitals.
[03:00:06.198 --> 03:00:07.839]  And they are being exposed in doing that.
[03:00:07.899 --> 03:00:09.739]  First they say they did it, then they say they don't.
[03:00:09.819 --> 03:00:13.681]  Then they said, actually we did do it because Hamas was there, but they created Hamas.
[03:00:13.981 --> 03:00:15.441]  They're creating a new temple.
[03:00:15.621 --> 03:00:17.602]  That's what Benjamin Netanyahu says himself.
[03:00:17.942 --> 03:00:20.603]  They want to build a new Solomon's Temple.
[03:00:20.923 --> 03:00:25.105]  I know people will say that's anti-Semitic, but it's what they themselves are saying they are doing.
[03:00:25.425 --> 03:00:28.466]  It's no different than the creation of a Tower of Babel in Babylon.
[03:00:29.786 --> 03:00:35.628]  These are real things that are happening, and people say, well, you know, it was Jewish territory first.
[03:00:35.729 --> 03:00:40.030]  Okay, well, let's use the same example then for the United States.
[03:00:40.710 --> 03:00:41.691]  I'm part Native American.
[03:00:41.731 --> 03:00:44.312]  Let's just say it was Native American territory first.
[03:00:44.592 --> 03:00:47.713]  And people will say, well, that's not religious, that is racial.
[03:00:48.373 --> 03:00:49.574]  Okay, well, let's go with that then.
[03:00:49.834 --> 03:00:54.636]   The Native Americans sacrificed people on pyramids and drank Babies blood.
[03:00:55.416 --> 03:00:57.118]  Does that make it okay suddenly?
[03:00:57.738 --> 03:00:58.939]  What is the logic in this?
[03:00:58.979 --> 03:01:00.180]  There is no logic in it.
[03:01:00.600 --> 03:01:06.065]  If people are here, this is where they stand, this is where they're born or they live, let people be.
[03:01:06.285 --> 03:01:13.711]  The biggest enemy of humanity is the state and central banks and the issue is that people are using religion in order to manipulate state.
[03:01:14.171 --> 03:01:15.472]  In order to kill people.
[03:01:15.772 --> 03:01:17.614]  And I consider myself a Christian.
[03:01:17.914 --> 03:01:21.957]  And I think it's an absolute atrocity what we're witnessing in Israel.
[03:01:22.457 --> 03:01:24.719]  Yeah, the Bible says that Israel is the homeland.
[03:01:25.259 --> 03:01:27.441]  Okay, but let's think for a second here.
[03:01:27.841 --> 03:01:32.305]  Does it say anywhere that no matter what government takes over and how evil it is, it's okay?
[03:01:32.645 --> 03:01:33.345]  No, it doesn't.
[03:01:33.546 --> 03:01:34.827]  It doesn't say that anywhere.
[03:01:34.907 --> 03:01:38.864]   It says that it very much calls for peace, it calls for unity, it
[03:01:38.864 --> 03:01:43.144]   calls for love, it calls for all these things. It does not call for mass murdering a
[03:01:43.144 --> 03:01:45.333]  population that's 50% children.
[03:01:45.333 --> 03:01:50.694]   And we have a bunch of people on the left suddenly supporting Palestine, as they have for a long
[03:01:50.694 --> 03:01:56.054]   time, but they don't understand that Hamas was created by the US intelligence agencies and
[03:01:56.054 --> 03:01:58.453]  Mossad and Israel and MI6. They don't...
[03:01:58.553 --> 03:01:59.253]  We've got 10 seconds.
[03:01:59.313 --> 03:02:00.474]  We're about to go to break.
[03:02:00.494 --> 03:02:01.594]  Your analysis is amazing.
[03:02:01.614 --> 03:02:04.096]  We'll be right back for the last segment after this break.
[03:02:03.935 --> 03:02:08.854]   radar and it's the same thing we saw in the beginning of 2020 with COVID.
[03:02:08.854 --> 03:02:09.854]  People on the left and the right now...
[03:02:09.854 --> 03:02:10.854]  Josh, don't go anywhere.
[03:02:10.854 --> 03:02:11.854]  We've got 10 seconds.
[03:02:11.854 --> 03:02:13.694]  We're about to go to break.
[03:02:13.694 --> 03:02:15.415]  Your analysis is amazing.
[03:02:15.415 --> 03:02:18.614]  We'll be right back for the last segment after this break.
[03:02:18.614 --> 03:02:19.614]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:02:19.614 --> 03:02:23.056]   We're back with Josh Siegertsen from World Alternative Media.
[03:02:23.206 --> 03:02:25.487]  You can find his videos on Band.Video.
[03:02:25.687 --> 03:02:26.688]  Multiply the platforms.
[03:02:26.728 --> 03:02:33.212]  I want to plug his ex because I saw that his shadow band is asking for people to help him break through the algorithm.
[03:02:33.992 --> 03:02:39.335]  Josh, before this break, you were really hammering through the info.
[03:02:39.375 --> 03:02:40.576]  We've got 10 minutes left.
[03:02:40.976 --> 03:02:41.777]  Please continue.
[03:02:41.837 --> 03:02:42.517]  I want to hear it all.
[03:02:43.891 --> 03:02:44.471]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:02:44.511 --> 03:03:05.343]  So, I wanted to point out that Klaus Schwab said something last year that a lot of people missed, and he said that China is the role model for the Great Reset, and that really is a statement that people really need to listen to, because we had zero COVID policies in places like China, and that is almost the exact blueprint for 15-minute cities worldwide, which, of course, Klaus Schwab is pushing.
[03:03:06.023 --> 03:03:09.445]  They had rations, and then they had bank runs, and what happened after the bank runs?
[03:03:09.485 --> 03:03:16.066]   People were disappeared, and protesters were disappeared, because they I did not do what they were told they have of course things
[03:03:16.066 --> 03:03:19.446]   like social credit there as they've had for a long time or as they might call
[03:03:19.446 --> 03:03:23.135]   it Sesame credit and a lot of people will say with bricks in the world reserve
[03:03:23.135 --> 03:03:26.836]   currency system that the United States will never allow this to happen and I
[03:03:26.836 --> 03:03:30.546]   think that's one of the biggest errors people make they wanted to happen
[03:03:30.595 --> 03:03:32.656]  They've been building this up for all this time.
[03:03:32.696 --> 03:03:35.337]  They're the reason that Russia is as strong as they are.
[03:03:35.357 --> 03:03:39.819]  They're the reason why Israel and China and India are as strong as they are.
[03:03:39.839 --> 03:03:44.541]  They've been helping these countries be propped up as world leaders for a very long time.
[03:03:44.822 --> 03:03:46.062]  They want this to happen.
[03:03:46.242 --> 03:03:47.483]  They just need the right crisis.
[03:03:47.583 --> 03:03:58.008]  They weaken people with inflation over decades and eventually you get to the point where they know it cannot last because all fiat currencies eventually revert to their true value of zero.
[03:03:58.547 --> 03:04:00.409]  And they need some kind of switch.
[03:04:00.670 --> 03:04:05.675]  The best switch is a full reset of the financial system and something that benefits them.
[03:04:05.716 --> 03:04:10.221]  They'll say, hey, we will come to your rescue after all these monetary problems.
[03:04:10.561 --> 03:04:16.228]  So let's say the dollar collapses and you have this new world as our currency system and they say, oh, it's backed by gold.
[03:04:16.688 --> 03:04:18.909]  Yeah, it's backed by gold that you don't see.
[03:04:18.949 --> 03:04:21.029]  They have no proof of the amount of gold in supply.
[03:04:21.349 --> 03:04:27.851]  It's much like the gold standard was in the United States before the 70s, which is that they printed more IOUs than they have gold.
[03:04:27.911 --> 03:04:29.591]  But this time, it's digital.
[03:04:30.291 --> 03:04:37.513]  And everyone has the same currency based on a basket of currencies of the yuan and the ruble and the rupee, etc.
[03:04:37.853 --> 03:04:43.674]  And now we have Saudi Arabia openly saying in August that they are joining BRICS officially, same with United Arab Emirates.
[03:04:44.079 --> 03:04:44.839]  And Argentina.
[03:04:45.299 --> 03:04:49.781]  And this is a massive move, and I believe that Mexico will likely join later as well.
[03:04:49.821 --> 03:04:51.402]  We're going to see most of Latin America.
[03:04:51.882 --> 03:04:58.404]  And if you look at the BRICS population before this August meeting, it was 3.4 billion people worldwide.
[03:04:58.724 --> 03:05:02.506]  With everyone trying to join BRICS, I did the calculations on ChatGPT.
[03:05:02.546 --> 03:05:08.708]  I know it's a terrible thing that's trying to take over humanity, but I used ChatGPT to try and look at the full population.
[03:05:09.266 --> 03:05:11.147]  It was 6.6 billion people.
[03:05:11.907 --> 03:05:12.707]  6.6 billion people.
[03:05:12.747 --> 03:05:14.288]  The United States has already lost.
[03:05:14.488 --> 03:05:16.989]  All it takes is people actually knowing about it.
[03:05:17.529 --> 03:05:21.731]  It's when people are told they lost that they will truly lose.
[03:05:22.091 --> 03:05:23.852]  It's when the whole system will shift.
[03:05:24.112 --> 03:05:26.633]  And they need a world war as an excuse for that.
[03:05:26.913 --> 03:05:33.116]  So there's multiple layers and tiers to the reason behind the World War III scenario we're witnessing right now.
[03:05:33.432 --> 03:05:37.872]   and people have to understand it's not about voting, even protesting, it's about
[03:05:37.872 --> 03:05:41.311]   withdrawing from the system. We must withdraw. We don't want to just talk
[03:05:41.311 --> 03:05:45.191]   about problems here. We need to withdraw from the system and be self-prepared.
[03:05:45.191 --> 03:05:50.951]   You know, again, the basis of humanity is freedom and individuality, not
[03:05:50.951 --> 03:05:56.512]   coercive, collective responsibility. That's slavery. It is individual
[03:05:56.512 --> 03:06:00.752]   responsibility. Freedom isn't something you hold in your hands. You are free or
[03:06:00.752 --> 03:06:05.392]   you are not. It depends on you. You are the freedom. You decide that and
[03:06:05.392 --> 03:06:08.312]   you decide that by pulling your money out of the banking system, pulling
[03:06:08.312 --> 03:06:15.333]   your support out of grocery stores and into you know, storable foods and local farms and stuff like
[03:06:15.333 --> 03:06:18.213]   that and people say, "Well, that's difficult. That's too difficult."
[03:06:18.213 --> 03:06:22.013]   Well, okay, we can say it's difficult. It's going to be a lot more difficult for you later on
[03:06:22.013 --> 03:06:25.412]   if no one's prepared. And guess what? No matter how awake you are,
[03:06:25.412 --> 03:06:30.012]   at the end of the day, if you aren't prepared today, then tomorrow, when all this stuff comes down,
[03:06:30.012 --> 03:06:33.113]   then you, no matter how awake you are, you are going to be following the line
[03:06:33.113 --> 03:06:35.713]  or you're going to be thrown in the closest gulag.
[03:06:35.713 --> 03:06:40.113]   So, people have to understand this today and not just wait for something to happen.
[03:06:40.113 --> 03:06:43.152]   People have been saying, "Oh, well, the dollar is collapsing for years."
[03:06:43.717 --> 03:06:59.162]   Yeah, but the difference is it doesn't happen overnight it happens over a decade or two and Eventually when that goes down then we move into that new system and there will be no going back at that point My my advice is always this All roads lead to Rome.
[03:06:59.562 --> 03:07:03.325]  So we build a little path off that road that doesn't go to Rome.
[03:07:03.685 --> 03:07:11.190]  It's going to be bumpy, it's going to be gravel, it's not going to be as convenient, it's going to be slower than the main road, but at least we'll have that road.
[03:07:11.210 --> 03:07:20.596]  When the Tower of Babel comes crashing down and they still need to finish building it so it gets worse before it gets better, but it does get better because good overcomes evil, then we have a road on the side to go down.
[03:07:20.855 --> 03:07:26.494]   We built our new civilization in the aftermath from the ashes of the destruction of the Tower
[03:07:26.494 --> 03:07:31.774]   of Babel and this technocratic agenda that is really biblical that they are building
[03:07:31.774 --> 03:07:32.774]  out for us.
[03:07:32.774 --> 03:07:36.895]   So that is why it's so important to not depend on the banking system, the grocery stores,
[03:07:36.895 --> 03:07:41.715]   not depend on all the conveniences that they want you depending on, like telling you to
[03:07:41.715 --> 03:07:49.055]   live in big cities and of course support globalist policies that force you into a place where
[03:07:49.055 --> 03:07:53.175]   they could just shut down streets, put up cameras, smart grids and force you into a
[03:07:53.175 --> 03:07:57.415]   Logan's Run type scenario that you will never be able to escape once you're in it.
[03:07:57.415 --> 03:08:07.415]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:07:58.826 --> 03:08:00.787]  Yeah, I absolutely agree with you, Josh.
[03:08:01.247 --> 03:08:09.029]  I often reference the letter, it's 2030, I have no privacy and life has never been better by the puppet, Ida Orkin, the WEF puppet.
[03:08:09.049 --> 03:08:15.231]  And she actually describes, you know, these communities that live out in abandoned houses and things like that.
[03:08:15.271 --> 03:08:20.153]  And I say, well, my future's not to, you know, inhabit dilapidated houses, if that's what she's thinking.
[03:08:20.233 --> 03:08:28.198]   I really do think that As more people realise, I was just speaking to someone yesterday who said he was talking to a leftist who is waking up and going, I don't know what to do.
[03:08:28.998 --> 03:08:34.783]  You know, people are realising that they are setting up an absolute digital dictatorship.
[03:08:34.943 --> 03:08:36.184]  No one wants CBDCs.
[03:08:36.864 --> 03:08:38.827]  No one really wants digital IDs.
[03:08:39.368 --> 03:08:42.071]  They see the risks of this model.
[03:08:42.131 --> 03:08:44.094]  You're right, it's based on the Chinese model.
[03:08:44.775 --> 03:08:48.660]  No one actually wants to do this.
[03:08:48.700 --> 03:08:50.803]  What do you mean I'm not allowed any meat?
[03:08:51.103 --> 03:08:52.926]  What do you mean we're going to ban it?
[03:08:53.526 --> 03:08:56.748]  Mayor Adams, what do you mean I can't have dairy?
[03:08:56.808 --> 03:09:04.852]  What do you mean I can only buy three items of clothing per year as per the ARUP future of smart cities in a 1.5 degree world?
[03:09:05.172 --> 03:09:10.635]  What do you mean I can only travel 1,500 kilometres every three years per person?
[03:09:10.875 --> 03:09:11.756]  What do you mean?
[03:09:12.356 --> 03:09:13.757]  I can't have my private vehicle.
[03:09:13.797 --> 03:09:16.459]  People are rejecting this en masse.
[03:09:16.779 --> 03:09:27.446]  And so right now, those who are resilient, who've been able to withstand the trauma that they've tried to inflict on us, but have failed miserably because we're not going to be traumatized by maniacs.
[03:09:27.486 --> 03:09:28.507]  We don't care.
[03:09:28.527 --> 03:09:32.730]  The human spirit is stronger than these evil Satanist bastards.
[03:09:33.070 --> 03:09:37.434]  And so, you know, we can really set an example for the rest of the world.
[03:09:37.814 --> 03:09:40.617]  And Alex often says it, you know, bring them along.
[03:09:40.657 --> 03:09:40.897]  Yeah.
[03:09:40.937 --> 03:09:41.217]  Okay.
[03:09:41.257 --> 03:09:42.198]  They've just woken up.
[03:09:42.598 --> 03:09:42.979]  Okay.
[03:09:43.159 --> 03:09:46.742]  You can spend your time beating them over the head or you can bring them along the journey.
[03:09:48.183 --> 03:09:48.944]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:09:49.024 --> 03:09:51.126]  And, you know, tyranny comes under the guise of convenience.
[03:09:51.166 --> 03:09:59.433]  So people have a hard time letting go of that convenience, but letting go of conveniences and going the more difficult route is always the best way to go.
[03:10:00.251 --> 03:10:02.953]  It's not working harder, it's working smarter.
[03:10:03.013 --> 03:10:12.379]  That's an old saying and I think it's important that people understand this so that they can build that new world for their kids, their grandkids going forward that isn't based in this old system.
[03:10:12.619 --> 03:10:19.743]  Now the thing is, we do have to battle convenience and we have to create some of our own conveniences to lure some people that are more resistant in.
[03:10:20.044 --> 03:10:22.565]  That's why I'm supportive of privacy coins.
[03:10:22.685 --> 03:10:28.946]   It's a conversation for another day, but We're talking privacy coins that are completely encrypted
[03:10:28.946 --> 03:10:32.486]  and against the state overwatch.
[03:10:32.486 --> 03:10:35.285]  I like Epic Cash, Monero, things like that.
[03:10:35.285 --> 03:10:38.805]   Things that can pull you out of that system, not investment advice for legal reasons.
[03:10:38.805 --> 03:10:43.286]   But then gold and silver, things that you hold in your hand and things that will keep
[03:10:43.286 --> 03:10:49.006]   you outside of the mainstream monetary system because people are enslaved by what the government
[03:10:49.006 --> 03:10:52.245]  currency is, what the government dictates currency is.
[03:10:52.245 --> 03:10:57.765]   And they call for a ledger that will track your every move and base your value on what
[03:10:57.765 --> 03:11:00.445]  you do on a daily basis, what you eat, where you walk.
[03:11:00.445 --> 03:11:02.326]  And they're already doing this in Paris, Amsterdam.
[03:11:02.326 --> 03:11:03.506]  They're doing it in Australia.
[03:11:03.506 --> 03:11:05.366]  They're doing it in the UK.
[03:11:05.366 --> 03:11:07.045]  They're doing it in Canada and the United States.
[03:11:07.045 --> 03:11:09.206]  So what are people waiting for is always my question.
[03:11:09.206 --> 03:11:19.206]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:11:10.319 --> 03:11:11.300]  I agree with you, Josh.
[03:11:11.520 --> 03:11:16.085]  Amazing analysis, amazing commentary, and truly, truly, very, very thoroughly researched.
[03:11:16.165 --> 03:11:17.246]  I really appreciate your work.
[03:11:17.567 --> 03:11:19.248]  Please let people know where they can follow you.
[03:11:20.770 --> 03:11:30.440]  Yeah, you can find me on band.video at World Alternative Media, as well as Rumble, Brighteon, BitChute, and of course, Twitter slash X at World Alt Media.
[03:11:31.110 --> 03:11:33.872]  And yeah, I'm on a bunch of platforms except for YouTube.
[03:11:33.932 --> 03:11:39.416]  I got taken down proudly in 2020 and three years later, I've never felt better.
[03:11:39.516 --> 03:11:43.919]  So it's good to get off of those platforms and support platforms like Band.Video.
[03:11:44.139 --> 03:11:52.425]  Support your platform over at zmedia.com and support people who are actually coming out and trying to do things to change the world, change the narrative.
[03:11:52.845 --> 03:11:55.666]  And of course I have to bring in Brighteon on that as well.
[03:11:55.726 --> 03:11:57.066]  Mike Adams does an amazing job.
[03:11:57.626 --> 03:11:59.967]  All these sites we have, they're not competing.
[03:12:00.007 --> 03:12:08.749]  We're just creating new sites for new viewers, for new eyes to actually expose the truth and I think that's so incredibly important going forward.
[03:12:09.130 --> 03:12:13.131]  I'm also on Rockfin where you can join our newsletter through that.
[03:12:13.531 --> 03:12:17.812]  We have a subscription tier on there as well for subscriber only content.
[03:12:19.031 --> 03:12:19.711]  Amazing, Josh.
[03:12:19.731 --> 03:12:21.032]  We so appreciate your time.
[03:12:21.092 --> 03:12:24.413]  God bless you and really, really appreciate all of your work.
[03:12:24.933 --> 03:12:27.434]  And to everyone viewing today, please share this.
[03:12:27.774 --> 03:12:39.379]  Please continue to elevate all of the amazing voices that are not afraid to speak out and be labelled with, you know, all of the ridiculous labels that are out there today against truth speakers.
[03:12:39.679 --> 03:12:47.292]  We need to face the truth if we have any chance of saving this planet from these maniacs and we can save this planet.
[03:12:47.332 --> 03:12:51.438]  We can save humanity if we band together and reject their plans.
[03:12:51.479 --> 03:12:52.019]  God bless you.
[03:12:51.859 --> 03:12:52.699]  I'll see you soon.
[03:12:52.699 --> 03:12:56.059]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[03:12:56.059 --> 03:13:01.259]  I've not been this excited ever!
[03:13:01.259 --> 03:13:02.059]  [CHEERING]
[03:13:02.059 --> 03:13:03.859]  Oh, yeah, Mud Club, baby!
[03:13:04.727 --> 03:13:07.349]  The replatforming begins now.
[03:13:07.469 --> 03:13:19.064]   Join Mug Club and get one month free with promo code ALEX at jonescrowder.com So you want somebody to stand up against the globalists?
[03:13:19.084 --> 03:13:20.425]  You want somebody to fight the new world order?
[03:13:20.986 --> 03:13:22.847]  Well, if you're looking for that, I'm your man.
[03:13:23.427 --> 03:13:24.968]  I want to thank you all for your previous support.
[03:13:25.008 --> 03:13:30.511]  I want to thank you all for making The Great Reset and The War for the World a number one national bestseller.
[03:13:30.831 --> 03:13:32.192]  It's had a huge effect.
[03:13:32.973 --> 03:13:33.553]  We've topped it.
[03:13:34.254 --> 03:13:35.895]  This new book has just come out.
[03:13:36.255 --> 03:13:39.337]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com, signed or unsigned.
[03:13:40.370 --> 03:13:41.211]  It is incredible.
[03:13:41.531 --> 03:13:45.914]  It goes through the entire globalist master plan, their activities, what makes them tick.
[03:13:46.694 --> 03:13:49.396]  And then we lay out an alternate plan for humanity.
[03:13:49.896 --> 03:13:53.178]  And unlike the globalists, we're not ordering people to follow our plan.
[03:13:53.478 --> 03:13:56.920]  We're simply giving alternatives to the dystopia they're building.
[03:13:57.180 --> 03:13:58.801]  That's why it's the Great Awakening.
[03:13:59.422 --> 03:14:03.945]  Defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[03:14:04.685 --> 03:14:17.235]  What they're selling, owning nothing, having nothing, eating bugs, castrating our children, cutting our daughters' breasts off, World War III with Russia, human smuggling, open borders, drag queen pedophile time.
[03:14:17.675 --> 03:14:24.741]  What they're selling is so unpopular, we've got to oppose what they're doing, but also give an alternate plan.
[03:14:25.141 --> 03:14:27.623]  And that's what this book opens the debate about.
[03:14:28.042 --> 03:14:31.083]  It is powerful, it is riveting, it is informative.
[03:14:31.083 --> 03:14:35.602]   I have poured my heart out and the book is a lot thicker than my last book.
[03:14:35.602 --> 03:14:41.561]   It is quite the read, but it's a fast read, it's an informative read, it is a blueprint
[03:14:41.561 --> 03:14:42.842]  for victory against the globalists.
[03:14:42.842 --> 03:14:48.721]   So get your copy of The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globalists and launch the
[03:14:48.721 --> 03:14:51.802]  next great renaissance at InfoWarsTore.com.

[03:15:38.063 --> 03:15:41.206]  At InfowarStore.com, you'd be insane to not get Alexa Pure.
